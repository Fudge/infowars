[00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:06.153]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:07.914]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.914 --> 00:00:09.695]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:11.276]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:12.817]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.122]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.923]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:30.923 --> 00:00:38.351]  It is the 22nd day of June 2010 on this Thursday, Tuesday edition.
[00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:40.032]  Tuesday edition.
[00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:44.497]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:44.497 --> 00:00:53.326]  By the way, Governor Jesse Ventura will be joining us live Friday for the full second hour of radio broadcast.
[00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:15.785]  Coming up today, joining us in the middle of the third hour until the end of the broadcast in the fourth hour is Alan Watt, researcher and expert on the New World Order to get his take on current events and the current activities of the New World Order system.
[00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:19.948]  Again, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, the 22nd day of June 2010 edition.
[00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.049]  Where to start?
[00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.570]  How about diving in right here.
[00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.312]  The former head of Mossad says that he supports a preemptive attack on Iran.
[00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:43.776]  So the former head of the Israeli spy forces, more and more politicians over there including Netanyahu, the leader of Israel says they may go ahead and attack Iran.
[00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:45.136]  Very provocative.
[00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:47.637]  The United States and of course the UN are moving to pass
[00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:56.647]  Different resolutions to begin boarding all Iranian ships in multiple waterways of the Middle East.
[00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:59.049]  This is an act of war.
[00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:15.558]  Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Gates is running around, just repeating, replaying the exact same propaganda leading up in the two years to the attack on Iraq in 2003, that they've got super missiles, they have nukes, and they're going to attack us any minute.
[00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:18.060]  If we don't attack Iran, they're going to kill us.
[00:02:19.053 --> 00:02:24.296]  And then of course when they're done nuking Iran, if we don't attack other countries, they'll kill us.
[00:02:24.296 --> 00:02:31.820]  And if the police don't raid your house and shoot your dog, why you may use drugs, even though the government ships the drugs in.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.142]  Even though the government gave nuclear weapons systems to Pakistan and North Korea.
[00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:41.285]  I saw another video this morning without even looking, it's just everywhere, of some grandmother
[00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:46.594]  Her 28-year-old grandson hasn't lived with her in 12 years.
[00:02:46.594 --> 00:02:48.595]  The SWAT team came.
[00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:50.897]  She said, let me put my small dog in the bathroom.
[00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:51.657]  They said, okay.
[00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:52.698]  She put the dog in the bathroom.
[00:02:52.698 --> 00:02:54.139]  It was barking and growling.
[00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.562]  The cops opened the door and killed the dog and say it's a good thing they did.
[00:02:57.562 --> 00:03:00.244]  Just no common sense.
[00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:01.544]  It's the religion of power.
[00:03:01.544 --> 00:03:06.668]  We're going to come in your house 12 years after your grandson lived with you on a drug warrant.
[00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:10.551]  We're going to let you put your dog in the bathroom and then we're going to go in the bathroom and kill it.
[00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:16.660]  And we're going to be ham-fisted and stupid.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.264]  And it's just to watch the police chief defending it on the news, every time.
[00:03:21.264 --> 00:03:25.528]  It's this religion of the state and the religion of the officer's safety.
[00:03:25.528 --> 00:03:28.691]  They could care less about your safety, police.
[00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:34.596]  When you huffed all that deadly toxin on 9-11, they told you it was fine and blocked healthcare for you.
[00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:38.360]  When they tell you to hang your butts out there in the middle of the road, writing people tickets all day.
[00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:46.873]  They don't care about your safety by making drugs illegal and energizes drug gangs, one of the most dangerous forces out there.
[00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.354]  That's why Mexico is completely collapsed.
[00:03:49.354 --> 00:04:05.284]  Now, upwards of a hundred miles into Arizona, well past Tucson, the American people are told not to enter a three-county area bigger than the state of Connecticut.
[00:04:05.284 --> 00:04:05.904]  That's coming up.
[00:04:07.802 --> 00:04:08.624]  I don't want to hear it.
[00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.668]  It's just all mind control.
[00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:14.977]  And this country is like a rotten horse in the ditch, swollen.
[00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:17.161]  It's been dead four or five days.
[00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:21.318]  And it stinks to high heaven.
[00:04:21.318 --> 00:04:22.819]  I mean, that's all I can really say.
[00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.579]  I'm going to be breaking that down today as well.
[00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:26.640]  And look at this.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.440]  Next Wikileaks release may involve Echelon.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:39.102]  If they have information related to tasking the system, such as the words and phrases used on targets of the system, or actual intercepts, that would be pretty astonishing.
[00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:41.943]  It's hard to believe they would have stuff like this, but who knows?
[00:04:44.594 --> 00:04:49.682]  Also, Apple collecting, sharing iPhone users' precise locations.
[00:04:49.682 --> 00:04:54.009]  Google faces prosecution in France for breaking laws.
[00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:54.751]  What's the NSA?
[00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.094]  What do you think the NSA is going to do?
[00:04:57.094 --> 00:04:57.996]  And a lot more.
[00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:58.437]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:04.707]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:05:04.707 --> 00:05:05.688]  What have we got?
[00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:08.129]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.130]  A republic.
[00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.791]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.053]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:05:14.053 --> 00:05:16.074]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:17.755]  So they think they own our land?
[00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:19.076]  They think they own our water?
[00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:19.696]  Children?
[00:05:19.696 --> 00:05:20.797]  Our education?
[00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:21.638]  Our money?
[00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:25.300]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.346]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:30.648]  You have been warned.
[00:05:30.648 --> 00:05:31.650]  We have the facts.
[00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.831]  We have the Constitution.
[00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:33.733]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:34.614]  We have common law.
[00:05:34.614 --> 00:05:37.138]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:37.138 --> 00:05:40.924]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:45.968]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:47.469]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:48.549]  Don't tread on me.
[00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:55.414]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:03.999]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.919]  Number 1.
[00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.340]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.200]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.102]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:14.842]  It's true.
[00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:19.704]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.704 --> 00:06:20.544]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.544 --> 00:06:24.126]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:27.827]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.027 --> 00:06:28.827]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:31.588]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.588 --> 00:06:35.269]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:36.049]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:40.210]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.252]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.252 --> 00:06:49.433]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:08.227]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.227 --> 00:08:17.472]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.472 --> 00:08:19.933]  We've been reporting since Sunday.
[00:08:22.247 --> 00:08:31.873]  That large areas of Arizona, one county alone is larger than the state of Connecticut, are now off-limits to the American people.
[00:08:31.873 --> 00:08:35.576]  This is areas far north of even Tucson.
[00:08:37.188 --> 00:08:49.941]  So in some cases over a hundred miles, in other areas 80 miles, into the United States, the police are openly saying mayday, mayday, mayday.
[00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:51.822]  Sheriff's deputies have been shot.
[00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:53.664]  Sheriff's deputies have been killed.
[00:08:53.664 --> 00:08:53.984]  U.S.
[00:08:53.984 --> 00:08:55.246]  military have been killed.
[00:08:55.246 --> 00:08:55.426]  U.S.
[00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:56.427]  military have been wounded.
[00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:58.109]  FBI agents have been killed.
[00:08:59.409 --> 00:09:01.311]  Ranchers in Arizona have been murdered.
[00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:04.053]  Their homes have been burned down.
[00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:09.577]  In one case, more than 14 homes were burned in one night last year.
[00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:12.580]  It is all-out mass murder.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:19.785]  It is the plan of San Diego being carried out, the La Reconquista, the Infasora, the invasion.
[00:09:20.786 --> 00:09:35.270]  And it is actually intensified since the announcement that Arizona is in a mayday situation and is going to start, if they pull someone over and they don't have IDs, just like they would throw the book at a citizen, they will throw the book at the illegal aliens.
[00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.831]  It's a mirror of the federal law.
[00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:39.133]  But the Feds will not implement it.
[00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:50.704]  It's come out, even in the Associated Press, that they used illegal aliens to build 20-something and then 50-something miles of fake fence as part of a PR stunt under Bush, and used illegal aliens to do that.
[00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:58.849]  All the border states are on the verge of going bankrupt or have gone bankrupt because of the jails in LA.
[00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:01.570]  One case example, more than half illegal alien.
[00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.852]  Mexico is dumping its criminals on the United States.
[00:10:04.852 --> 00:10:08.113]  Mexico's criminals are running to the United States.
[00:10:08.113 --> 00:10:11.935]  Yes, a lot of these people do just want to, you know, work here in the country.
[00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:16.902]  But the bottom line is Mexico has collapsed.
[00:10:16.902 --> 00:10:21.563]  It's been a failed state even according to the State Department for two years.
[00:10:21.563 --> 00:10:24.643]  There have been travel advisories for five years.
[00:10:24.643 --> 00:10:37.626]  Now those travel advisories are all over South Texas, all over Arizona, Southern Arizona, up into the middle of Arizona, all over New Mexico, all over the border area in California.
[00:10:38.226 --> 00:10:45.351]  And it's getting worse and these people have no IDs, no names, they can blend into crowds.
[00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:48.593]  The murder that's going on is incredible.
[00:10:48.593 --> 00:10:58.680]  Remember the railway killer who'd been in jail more than 10 times and had killed and robbed and stabbed and shot and just rode around on trains enjoying himself.
[00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:04.242]  So the American people, everything we do is listened to by the NSA.
[00:11:04.242 --> 00:11:05.723]  Everything we do is tracked.
[00:11:05.723 --> 00:11:08.223]  The book is thrown at us for non-crimes.
[00:11:08.223 --> 00:11:09.464]  Our children are spied on.
[00:11:09.464 --> 00:11:11.164]  They're trained to spy on us.
[00:11:11.164 --> 00:11:12.325]  Our land's being taken.
[00:11:12.325 --> 00:11:14.726]  If you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, doesn't matter.
[00:11:14.726 --> 00:11:19.367]  If you're a citizen in the grid, you were there to be bled by the vampires.
[00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:22.648]  But the globalist vampires want desperately to break this country.
[00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:25.109]  They're involved in a revolution.
[00:11:26.733 --> 00:11:28.374]  against the country.
[00:11:28.374 --> 00:11:48.529]  They've got to break it and bankrupt it to the central banks and have a voting bloc that will vote for gun control and open borders and for pure democracy where 51% say take the middle class's property and give it to us, the poor people, but of course it's always baited and switched and given to the elites once the middle class is destroyed.
[00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.850]  The poor and working class and blue collar have no
[00:11:52.151 --> 00:11:56.616]  Strategy or no ladder to go up into the middle class.
[00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:59.359]  See, we had a growing middle class until 30 years ago.
[00:11:59.359 --> 00:12:00.920]  Since then, it's been shrinking.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.143]  We had a middle class, the envy of the world.
[00:12:03.143 --> 00:12:05.044]  So did Argentina.
[00:12:05.044 --> 00:12:08.548]  A hundred years ago was the wealthiest country in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:10.790]  The saying was as rich as an Argentine.
[00:12:11.511 --> 00:12:19.775]  Now they are absolutely in bondage after controlled implosion, after controlled implosion, over and over and over again.
[00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:22.217]  We are in the process of being completely broken.
[00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:26.419]  And there's an amazing video that's posted in an article
[00:12:27.751 --> 00:12:28.531]  I don't know.
[00:12:42.008 --> 00:12:49.591]  With a sheriff in Arizona, another from Fox, and another at a town hall with Senator Kyle admitting what we've already known.
[00:12:49.591 --> 00:12:52.692]  What the Ford Foundation has admitted in their own papers.
[00:12:52.692 --> 00:12:55.733]  They are holding America hostage.
[00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.434]  They do not want to secure the border.
[00:12:58.254 --> 00:13:00.377]  They want a border war.
[00:13:00.377 --> 00:13:01.878]  They want burning buildings.
[00:13:01.878 --> 00:13:04.121]  They want dead cops everywhere.
[00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:06.303]  They want absolute implosion.
[00:13:06.303 --> 00:13:13.612]  And ladies and gentlemen, beautiful towns on the Texas border that were great tourist locations are boarded up and shut down.
[00:13:13.612 --> 00:13:14.773]  Okay?
[00:13:14.773 --> 00:13:17.616]  It is now creeping all the way up to southern San Antonio.
[00:13:18.789 --> 00:13:31.093]  The police have been taught to put their tail between their legs and literally have yellow you-know-what run down them and they just scream Mayday to the feds and the feds say we will do nothing.
[00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:37.496]  The feds openly, we told you this five years ago with our DEA sources, trained Los Zetas, they're CIA.
[00:13:37.496 --> 00:13:42.938]  They're down there raging a war against other cartels that don't launder their money through U.S.
[00:13:42.938 --> 00:13:43.758]  central banks.
[00:13:45.933 --> 00:13:48.895]  This is a $500 billion a year industry.
[00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:54.419]  And this is meant to bring the United States into total collapse on the southwest border.
[00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:59.962]  Then the feds can come in and say, oh, we've got to have immigration reform.
[00:13:59.962 --> 00:14:01.003]  We're going to fix it.
[00:14:01.003 --> 00:14:11.470]  And then when you read the last four versions, Obama's version and Bush's last three versions, it's the exact same Council on Foreign Relations plan written in 2006 and published on their site.
[00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.613]  Yes, it ends illegal immigration because it forms the North American corridor
[00:14:16.173 --> 00:14:42.534]  Between Canada the US and Mexico and a common border a geographic border and you notice for two years They're issuing hemispheric ID cards instead of a passport you get a federally issued ID card, which is accepted to fly It's now being accepted for truck drivers to drive and you can travel back and forth into the countries and so it does end the illegal immigration problem because it just legalizes and
[00:14:44.042 --> 00:14:51.427]  The Senator said he was in a meeting with Obama, and Obama told him point blank, I am holding people hostage.
[00:14:51.427 --> 00:14:53.549]  We are going to let this get out of control.
[00:14:53.549 --> 00:14:56.050]  In fact, we're going to get to that clip in a moment.
[00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.272]  Let's play U.S.
[00:14:58.272 --> 00:15:01.854]  Gives Parkland Along the Arizona-Mexican Border to Mexico.
[00:15:01.854 --> 00:15:03.275]  This is Fox News.
[00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:06.077]  And this is a La Reconquista.
[00:15:06.077 --> 00:15:07.659]  Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:13.965]  Uh, and they burned out the ranchers, they're burning everybody out, and it's now moved past Tucson.
[00:15:13.965 --> 00:15:15.507]  Tucson is now an island.
[00:15:15.507 --> 00:15:23.817]  The Tucson Traitorous City Council has ordered police not to ever even stop drunk driving illegals, illegals robbing people.
[00:15:23.817 --> 00:15:27.781]  I've watched hour after hour, wrapped on YouTube, of Tucson
[00:15:28.622 --> 00:15:28.923]  I think?
[00:15:45.823 --> 00:15:59.181]  Is totally dissolving the border and turning the US into a third world country and then bum-rushing bringing in the communist hordes that Hugo Chavez for the CIA is training well and to totally bring this country down for the bankers.
[00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:01.625]  This is the plan and it's not a joke.
[00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:03.187]  Let's go ahead and play this first clip.
[00:16:05.071 --> 00:16:08.973]  A massive stretch of Arizona now off-limits to Americans.
[00:16:08.973 --> 00:16:14.657]  Critics say the administration is, in effect, giving a major strip of the Southwest back to Mexico.
[00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:15.057]  U.S.
[00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:25.643]  Fish and Wildlife have closed a portion of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge all along the border, warning visitors to beware of heavily armed drug smugglers and human traffickers.
[00:16:25.643 --> 00:16:28.345]  Paul Babiou is the sheriff in Pinal County, Arizona.
[00:16:28.345 --> 00:16:29.946]  He joins us now by phone.
[00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:33.168]  Sheriff, this is a family show, so I'm going to put it like this.
[00:16:33.168 --> 00:16:34.529]  What the heck is going on down there?
[00:16:35.848 --> 00:16:57.618]  It's literally out of control and violence has increased just in the last four months and we've been, not just as a sheriff, all of our police chiefs in Pinell County, we stood with Senator McCain and literally demanded support for 3,000 soldiers to be deployed to Arizona to get this under control and finally secure our border with Mexico.
[00:16:58.291 --> 00:17:06.503]  Alright, I gotta tell you, when I first received an email about this with these signs that are up saying, you know, don't go past this point, stay away, this is not safe.
[00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:10.449]  I mean, we're not talking about something that's sort of a Tijuana situation right at the border.
[00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:12.672]  I mean, we're talking about something that's north of Tucson.
[00:17:12.672 --> 00:17:14.334]  I mean, 80 miles away from the border?
[00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:30.700]  Exactly, and we're talking three counties deep into the heart of Arizona where the answer from our government is to put up signs warning our citizens and our sovereign nation that beware of foreigners who are there who are heavily armed.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:40.826]  We have squad-sized paramilitary elements that are working deep in our country that are escorting drugs and human illegals and
[00:17:41.596 --> 00:17:46.219]  Quite frankly, I'm telling you as a sheriff that I don't control that part of the county.
[00:17:46.219 --> 00:17:52.584]  My county is larger than the state of Connecticut, and we need support from the federal government.
[00:17:52.584 --> 00:17:55.966]  It's their job to secure the border, and they haven't done it.
[00:17:55.966 --> 00:18:02.690]  In fact, President Obama suspended the construction of the fence, and that's just simply outrageous.
[00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:10.456]  Would you like to see some of the president's outrage about the oil spill, which is justified in some of the butt-kicking that he's talked about doing, applied there on the border as well?
[00:18:11.775 --> 00:18:21.041]  Well, even with that, you say one thing and then you're out at a fundraiser in California, and you don't go to the funeral of the people who died in the explosion.
[00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:36.352]  You know, it's one thing to say something slick on television or in a ten-second soundbite, but we need deeds, we need action, and it's shameful that we, as the most powerful nation on Earth, can win wars and liberate countries,
[00:18:36.992 --> 00:18:37.652]  Thank you, Shannon.
[00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:09.394]  Really, Fox, you've been so sympathetic, telling us that George Bush is good and having Karl Rove on, who supported wide-open borders and funding this drug war down there?
[00:19:09.394 --> 00:19:12.376]  You want to end this right now, you legalize drugs, folks.
[00:19:12.376 --> 00:19:13.857]  You decriminalize drugs.
[00:19:13.857 --> 00:19:16.758]  There won't be any more money for all these paramilitary groups.
[00:19:16.758 --> 00:19:18.539]  But you're not going to do that.
[00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:21.361]  No, because the banks are laundering the money.
[00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:23.242]  And every cop out there knows this.
[00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:27.255]  Our government admittedly now grows the opium in Afghanistan.
[00:19:27.255 --> 00:19:28.876]  They always did.
[00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.396]  That's why they kicked the Russians out.
[00:19:30.396 --> 00:19:31.357]  That's why we're there now.
[00:19:31.357 --> 00:19:34.818]  To bring the smack in.
[00:19:34.818 --> 00:19:39.160]  And that Colombian flake and all the rest of that cocaine coming in.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.821]  But this is America!
[00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:41.341]  Now remember...
[00:19:42.912 --> 00:19:51.740]  They got plenty of SWAT teams and plenty of gun buyback programs and plenty of money for cops to come into the schools and brainwash your kids to spy on you.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:59.787]  They got plenty of SWAT teams to go kick down doors and kill old ladies' chihuahuas, but they don't have the manhood to get down there and defend that border.
[00:20:00.563 --> 00:20:05.526]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:20:05.526 --> 00:20:06.527]  What have we got?
[00:20:06.527 --> 00:20:08.949]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:20:08.949 --> 00:20:09.969]  A republic.
[00:20:09.969 --> 00:20:12.611]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:14.892]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:20:14.892 --> 00:20:16.914]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:20:16.914 --> 00:20:18.595]  So they think they own our land?
[00:20:18.595 --> 00:20:19.916]  They think they own our water?
[00:20:19.916 --> 00:20:20.516]  Children?
[00:20:20.516 --> 00:20:21.637]  Our education?
[00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:22.477]  Our money?
[00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:26.120]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.182]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:20:30.182 --> 00:20:31.463]  You're being warned.
[00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:32.484]  We have the facts.
[00:20:32.484 --> 00:20:33.644]  We have the Constitution.
[00:20:33.644 --> 00:20:34.545]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:35.445]  We have common law.
[00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:37.947]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:40.908]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:41.749]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:20:41.869 --> 00:20:46.791]  The tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:48.291]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:49.372]  Don't tread on me.
[00:20:49.372 --> 00:20:55.794]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:21:00.532 --> 00:21:03.473]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:03.473 --> 00:21:07.435]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:21:07.435 --> 00:21:09.896]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:09.896 --> 00:21:15.058]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:21:15.058 --> 00:21:16.878]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:18.199]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:19.900]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.282]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:28.646]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:28.646 --> 00:21:38.012]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[00:21:43.155 --> 00:21:46.636]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[00:21:52.898 --> 00:21:55.198]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:22:04.423 --> 00:22:05.763]  Think again!
[00:22:05.763 --> 00:22:13.405]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:22:13.405 --> 00:22:20.647]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:22:20.647 --> 00:22:26.009]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[00:22:26.229 --> 00:22:29.192]  On how to clean the air on boats, aiding in the Gulf Cleanup.

[00:23:00.038 --> 00:23:05.282]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[00:23:05.282 --> 00:23:05.982]  Listen.
[00:23:05.982 --> 00:23:10.246]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:23:10.246 --> 00:23:13.208]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[00:23:13.613 --> 00:23:16.675]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[00:23:16.675 --> 00:23:20.437]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[00:23:20.437 --> 00:23:28.883]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[00:23:28.883 --> 00:23:31.424]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[00:23:31.424 --> 00:23:35.787]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.

[00:24:08.363 --> 00:24:10.324]  Let it sink in real good.
[00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:13.626]  They tell you terrorists, hit us and hit us hard.
[00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:23.991]  Back on September 11, 2001, they admit that people from Muslim nations, Middle Eastern nations, are pouring across those borders.
[00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:26.812]  I've got countless local newscasts showing it.
[00:24:26.812 --> 00:24:37.277]  The local police will catch van loads of people from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and they're ordered to release them.
[00:24:38.564 --> 00:24:43.449]  Now obviously most of these guys are coming here illegally, just like Chinese immigrants are because they want jobs.
[00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:47.532]  Because we know most of the terror is staged, and so does the government.
[00:24:47.532 --> 00:25:09.193]  When they're good and ready to blow up some more buildings so they can militarize things and have you, the milk cow producer that the vampires feed off of, go into more slavery, when they're ready to put a bigger ball and chain on your ankles, on my ankles, when they're ready to raise taxes and tell you it's to keep Al Qaeda from coming out from under your bed at night and hurting you,
[00:25:10.458 --> 00:25:17.828]  They'll vaporize a city or blow up some more buildings or hijack some jets by remote control and fly them into buildings.
[00:25:17.828 --> 00:25:23.856]  And then there won't be any discussion on the news of why are our borders wide open, unless you're a citizen trying to come through with your ID.
[00:25:25.382 --> 00:25:30.364]  Oh, if you're a citizen, your car gets x-rayed, you get screamed at, U.S.
[00:25:30.364 --> 00:25:46.332]  Customs grabs all our cameras every time we come back in from Canada doing an interview and calls our office and makes us fax them the proof of purchase to make sure we're paying all our duties and didn't buy Sony cameras up there, and they let us know we're trash.
[00:25:46.952 --> 00:25:49.194]  You pay our salaries, scum!
[00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:51.215]  Get out there and lick those boots!
[00:25:51.215 --> 00:25:58.560]  We're not a bad... I'm seriously, folks, I've had Canadian Customs treat me like absolute trash, cussing at me off and on for 15 hours.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.901]  You know, I made the newspapers in Canada.
[00:26:00.901 --> 00:26:03.443]  They were going to send me to prison, they said.
[00:26:03.443 --> 00:26:05.184]  Flying in legally.
[00:26:05.184 --> 00:26:06.785]  Because I'm scum.
[00:26:06.785 --> 00:26:09.727]  And I've had the border guards treat me like scum.
[00:26:09.727 --> 00:26:11.008]  Because I'm an American.
[00:26:11.008 --> 00:26:12.489]  The American guards.
[00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:15.151]  Because they've been told, let this trash have it.
[00:26:16.331 --> 00:26:18.252]  Run these people into submission.
[00:26:18.252 --> 00:26:19.193]  Break their will.
[00:26:19.193 --> 00:26:24.855]  And they're like, look at how cowardly and weak the slaves are.
[00:26:24.855 --> 00:26:29.678]  Meanwhile, mass death, mass killing.
[00:26:29.678 --> 00:26:34.720]  22,000 deaths just on the border in the last two years on the Mexico and U.S.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.161]  side combined.
[00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:39.002]  Car bombs going off in Dallas, minor footnote.
[00:26:39.002 --> 00:26:43.044]  I mean, they're blowing up cars full of explosives.
[00:26:44.249 --> 00:26:45.231]  And it's a minor footnote.
[00:26:45.231 --> 00:26:47.856]  They're killing cops everywhere.
[00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:51.283]  And 800 plus cities, the illegal aliens are above the law.
[00:26:51.283 --> 00:26:55.571]  They pull them over, cars full of whiskey, pull them over with drugs, they just let them go.
[00:26:56.547 --> 00:26:57.247]  They just let them go.
[00:26:57.247 --> 00:26:59.588]  And if the cops do arrest them, they get reprimanded by the judge.
[00:26:59.588 --> 00:27:01.109]  The judge just lets them go.
[00:27:01.109 --> 00:27:11.134]  Because the globalists want the Latin American population here, because 90 plus percent of the time they vote for gun control and big government.
[00:27:11.134 --> 00:27:13.915]  Sure, there's 9 percent, I guess, of conservatives.
[00:27:13.915 --> 00:27:16.837]  That's why Cuban immigrants are great for this country.
[00:27:16.837 --> 00:27:18.558]  Because they're anti-communist.
[00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:23.526]  And again, this isn't what you think of as the mainline definition of communism.
[00:27:23.526 --> 00:27:27.928]  The bankers want communism.
[00:27:27.928 --> 00:27:32.650]  They want to tell you... See, the definition is never what they publicly claim it is.
[00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.072]  The average idiot in the street thinks communism means a free ride, means some government welfare.
[00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:37.852]  No.
[00:27:37.852 --> 00:27:41.274]  No, it means you're given just enough to make you dependent on the system.
[00:27:41.274 --> 00:27:47.437]  Like Obama is now unveiling the details of his health bill and going, oh, it helps you get insurance.
[00:27:48.237 --> 00:27:54.322]  And it makes poor people get it, and pay for part of it, and it raises taxes, and cuts Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:27:54.322 --> 00:27:55.783]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:27:55.783 --> 00:28:00.146]  I want to walk through, then we'll get into the latest on the spill, the latest with Iran.
[00:28:00.146 --> 00:28:06.011]  I want to walk through the situation we're facing in Arizona.
[00:28:06.011 --> 00:28:07.552]  Particularly, but also in Texas.
[00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:15.140]  You heard one of the sheriffs, and I've had the sheriffs in Texas on the show.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:27.792]  I'll see it in a local paper, I'll have my producers get them on over the years, where two miles, three miles, six miles over, Mexican troops in their Humvees pull up on the sheriff's deputies, they'll pull over a van full of cocaine or marijuana,
[00:28:28.593 --> 00:28:40.777]  This happens all the time, and here come Humvees out of the desert onto major highways, and they block the police cars in, because the illegals via walkie-talkie or cell phone, the drug smugglers, call the troops.
[00:28:40.777 --> 00:28:45.139]  The troops roar in, and they pull right up in military uniforms, and they walk right over.
[00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:49.763]  And they say, we're gonna kill you if you don't give us those drugs back.
[00:28:49.763 --> 00:28:56.108]  And the sheriffs say they don't like it, but they're surrounded, three to one, by Humvees with machine guns on them.
[00:28:56.108 --> 00:29:01.333]  And they call the feds, and the feds say, we're not even writing a report.
[00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:09.441]  Now, imagine if citizens flying Gadsden flags were routinely surrounding sheriff's deputies with automatic weapons and robbing them.
[00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:14.743]  It would be hyperventilating on CNN, MSNBC.
[00:29:14.743 --> 00:29:16.344]  It would be martial law.
[00:29:16.344 --> 00:29:21.446]  It would be we're banning all guns in America.
[00:29:21.446 --> 00:29:27.029]  When we come back, I'm going to play this senator admitting in a closed-door meeting with Obama.
[00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:32.591]  This is so vital that Obama said, I'm holding the American people hostage.
[00:29:32.591 --> 00:29:34.212]  We know the border's imploding.
[00:29:34.212 --> 00:29:37.053]  We're going to let this continue to unravel.
[00:29:37.053 --> 00:29:38.054]  That's why Bush
[00:29:39.113 --> 00:29:46.657]  Remember his big PR firm out of Dallas, the Dallas Morning News reported, funded the first illegal alien rallies five years ago?
[00:29:46.657 --> 00:29:50.560]  They are orchestrating all of this.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.960]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.482]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.482 --> 00:29:57.163]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:07.453]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:30:07.453 --> 00:30:12.717]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[00:30:12.717 --> 00:30:26.088]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:32.051]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.
[00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:35.213]  The Fall of America and the Western World.
[00:30:35.213 --> 00:30:35.973]  Net.

[00:31:00.131 --> 00:31:03.152]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.152 --> 00:31:08.474]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:08.474 --> 00:31:10.515]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:10.515 --> 00:31:15.516]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:15.516 --> 00:31:16.697]  How much do you want?
[00:31:16.697 --> 00:31:17.437]  When do you want it?
[00:31:17.817 --> 00:31:19.719]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:19.719 --> 00:31:20.781]  When will you need it?
[00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:22.983]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:22.983 --> 00:31:24.325]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.325 --> 00:31:25.847]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:25.847 --> 00:31:31.133]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:34.257]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:34.697 --> 00:31:38.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.741]  How much will you need?
[00:31:39.741 --> 00:31:40.642]  We don't know.
[00:31:40.642 --> 00:31:41.743]  How much do you want?
[00:31:41.743 --> 00:31:42.683]  All you can get.
[00:31:42.683 --> 00:31:43.784]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:43.784 --> 00:31:46.827]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:46.827 --> 00:31:48.608]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:48.608 --> 00:31:49.529]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:01.018 --> 00:32:04.999]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.999 --> 00:32:13.861]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:13.861 --> 00:32:18.482]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.482 --> 00:32:29.284]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:29.924 --> 00:32:39.453]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:39.453 --> 00:32:44.878]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:44.878 --> 00:32:52.364]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:52.364 --> 00:32:55.127]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:04.412 --> 00:33:09.004]  Alex Jones back live on the front lines of the InfoWar, deep behind enemy lines.
[00:33:09.004 --> 00:33:12.594]  You know, I've been running that liner for 13 years.
[00:33:14.568 --> 00:33:19.491]  From deep behind enemy lines, from the Central Texas Command Center, we are in occupied territory.
[00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:31.299]  We are occupied by an illegitimate offshore corporate government that wants to basically sell off the assets and has sold off most of the assets of the United States through globalization.
[00:33:31.299 --> 00:33:36.042]  This is a hostile corporate takeover and breakup of the United States.
[00:33:36.042 --> 00:33:42.707]  That is how all the globalists in their own books, their own handbooks, their own CFR reports describe it.
[00:33:42.707 --> 00:33:44.348]  This is what they've done to the third world.
[00:33:44.828 --> 00:33:54.312]  This is state-sponsored chaos in South Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California, and it's spreading.
[00:33:54.312 --> 00:34:01.394]  Because the illegal alien gangs can kill whoever they want, and no one identifies them, and they don't put them in prison.
[00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:05.516]  The government knows what they're doing, and it's high treason.
[00:34:05.516 --> 00:34:12.839]  Senator Kyle was told by Obama, in a closed-door session, what is already obvious.
[00:34:14.201 --> 00:34:16.385]  I studied how the British brought down China.
[00:34:16.385 --> 00:34:20.952]  China would not allow opium into their country because it was so addictive and it caused problems.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.561]  And so the British learned to bring it into their ports.
[00:34:24.561 --> 00:34:27.282]  Over a few decades, they corrupted the port cities.
[00:34:27.282 --> 00:34:30.742]  They got control of the local police because of the opium being illegal.
[00:34:30.742 --> 00:34:32.123]  It had huge premiums.
[00:34:32.123 --> 00:34:35.524]  Criminal gangs would rob and steal to get money for the opium.
[00:34:35.524 --> 00:34:38.625]  That then got fenced through the police and the British Intel.
[00:34:38.625 --> 00:34:46.907]  Then British Intel worked with the United States, France, and other Western governments and broke China first into four parts, then eight parts, and eleven parts.
[00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:49.027]  Go research it!
[00:34:49.027 --> 00:34:50.328]  This is... Handbooks!
[00:34:50.328 --> 00:34:54.692]  British Intel handbooks were declassified in the last hundred years.
[00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:55.853]  You can read all of this.
[00:34:55.853 --> 00:34:58.976]  There's been many best-selling books written about it.
[00:34:58.976 --> 00:35:01.818]  And the Boxer Rebellion was against this.
[00:35:01.818 --> 00:35:05.602]  And then it led to the Western powers being kicked out.
[00:35:05.602 --> 00:35:10.046]  So then they just funded Mao Zedong on record, now declassified.
[00:35:10.046 --> 00:35:12.268]  People wondered why Chiang Kai-shek got thrown out.
[00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:25.880]  They bring the drugs in, as long as you keep them illegal, that makes the price incredibly exorbitant, and then you take over society through the crime gangs.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.542]  This is state-sponsored terrorism!
[00:35:28.542 --> 00:35:36.509]  And now they're going to hold us all hostage, and they're going to pass the total amnesty, and America is broken and dead and over.
[00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.850]  And you will all be peons, you will be slaves.
[00:35:39.631 --> 00:36:01.660]  And the government will take the giant, dumbed-down underclass of poor Hispanics, white people, black people, you name it, and forge them into a political weapon who will vote for destroying what's left of the middle class and voting for 60, 70, 80% taxes, like France, and then transferring all that money to the elite, and the underclasses will be given small amounts of chicken feed.
[00:36:03.171 --> 00:36:12.497]  And the CPS will continue to take their kids for medical experiments and the rest of it, but they won't know, because all they care about is LeBron James and the latest basketball or football or baseball score.
[00:36:12.497 --> 00:36:19.681]  They are literally wide open and psychically and politically and spiritually blind to the New World Order.
[00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:27.746]  And I have 20-20 vision, just like our listeners do from researching this, and we're sitting here watching this in outraged horror.
[00:36:29.448 --> 00:36:32.870]  This is a 21st century wrecking crew.
[00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:38.692]  Homes burning, rocket attacks, murders, newspapers being hand-grenaded in the United States.
[00:36:38.692 --> 00:36:41.473]  It doesn't even make national news.
[00:36:41.473 --> 00:36:44.755]  Rocket attacks, hand-grenade attacks, kidnappings.
[00:36:44.755 --> 00:36:49.837]  Every week I read about 10, 15, 20, 57 Americans kidnapped on the U.S.
[00:36:49.837 --> 00:36:53.739]  side, drug over to Mexico, murdered in mass, sold,
[00:36:54.159 --> 00:37:04.428]  Mexican troops, Mexican police shaking college kids down for money, putting them in prison, getting their credit card numbers, demanding hundreds of thousands from their families to release them.
[00:37:04.428 --> 00:37:08.411]  And the media won't tell people to not tell their college kids to not go down there.
[00:37:08.411 --> 00:37:13.716]  The dummy uppies are in such denial, they send their young 18-year-old daughters down to Mexico.
[00:37:14.116 --> 00:37:14.316]  I think?
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:30.900]  We're good to go.
[00:37:53.885 --> 00:38:00.458]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, it's like when one of the Rockefeller sons was told, don't go to New Guinea and visit with these tribes.
[00:38:00.458 --> 00:38:04.746]  They kill about half the Westerners that go there and literally boil them in a pot and eat them.
[00:38:04.746 --> 00:38:05.688]  And that's what happened to him.
[00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.332]  But they won't tell you about Mexico.
[00:38:09.332 --> 00:38:11.695]  No, no, sir.
[00:38:11.695 --> 00:38:12.736]  No, sir.
[00:38:12.736 --> 00:38:16.881]  You're not allowed to talk about a third-world country completely collapsing.
[00:38:16.881 --> 00:38:18.122]  And let's go back to five years ago.
[00:38:18.122 --> 00:38:23.048]  What did Selly Costello, the most high-level DEA agent in Latin America at the time, what did he say?
[00:38:23.048 --> 00:38:25.150]  He said Los Zetas is in South Texas.
[00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:39.236]  Being trained by the CIA, and they're training other Mexican drug cartels, and they're about to launch a giant drug war and collapse Mexico into the United States for the North American Union, and Selly had been approached by Los Zetas to join them.
[00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:46.038]  And when he wouldn't join them, the ATF came to his house and arrested him for illegal shotguns and rifles.
[00:38:46.038 --> 00:38:49.259]  And he is now in prison, railroaded.
[00:38:49.259 --> 00:38:51.000]  Because he went public and exposed that.
[00:38:54.963 --> 00:39:03.669]  He told you five years ago, in 2005, two and a half years before all this started, what exactly was going to happen.
[00:39:03.669 --> 00:39:05.790]  We ought to pull up those old interviews and re-air them.
[00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:11.394]  He told you exactly what was going to happen.
[00:39:11.394 --> 00:39:14.696]  And now you see it, and it's an organized crisis.
[00:39:14.696 --> 00:39:15.977]  It's high treason.
[00:39:17.233 --> 00:39:17.633]  All right.
[00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:40.951]  Great, great, great, great grandparents were the smartest and the hardest fighting and the most inventive.
[00:39:40.951 --> 00:39:50.014]  I mean, people came from China and Japan and France and wrote about the American people and how we were the toughest, the smartest, the best, the meanest.
[00:39:50.014 --> 00:39:58.636]  And now, because we got fat and happy off of our ancestors, we are the most pathetic, degenerate, weak people in the world.
[00:39:58.636 --> 00:40:03.297]  And that's why we're being gang raped and run over and laughed at, because we put up with anything.
[00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:05.578]  There's nothing we won't put up with!
[00:40:05.578 --> 00:40:07.699]  There's nothing we won't bend over for!
[00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:08.659]  There's nothing!
[00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:10.920]  And you've got to get your American spirit back.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.900]  You're a spirit of liberty.
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:18.883]  You've got to get that fired up in your gut right now, because the entire Southwest is in flames right now, and it's only going to get worse.
[00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:20.524]  Do you understand that?
[00:40:20.524 --> 00:40:26.386]  What does the SPP documents that Judicial Watch sued in 2007 from the Banff Canada meeting say?
[00:40:26.826 --> 00:40:29.607]  With the heads of the Fortune 100 and the head of the U.S.
[00:40:29.607 --> 00:40:50.032]  State Department, Mexican and Canadian State Departments there, taking orders from the Fortune 100 in the meetings, thousands of pages of Judicial Watch, God, we cover it in Endgame, they said we're going to use border crises to bring in the North American Union, we're going to use flu to bring in the North American Union, and we're going to use financial collapse and carbon tax to bring in the North American Union.
[00:40:50.032 --> 00:40:51.893]  That is word for word.
[00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.731]  You realize the magnitude of what we're talking about?
[00:40:57.731 --> 00:41:01.232]  They are breaking America up just like they broke China up.
[00:41:01.232 --> 00:41:04.253]  Are you going to put up with this?
[00:41:04.253 --> 00:41:13.337]  You heard that sheriff saying, we are desperate, we need help, we are under attack, we are outnumbered a hundred to one, we are being shot at, we are being killed.
[00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:22.681]  Meanwhile, I've got another clip of militia groups are going down there with their M-16s, running around saying they're going to confront the illegals and
[00:41:26.909 --> 00:41:28.391]  The media is going to demonize them.
[00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:30.853]  This is just, this is insane.
[00:41:30.853 --> 00:41:33.276]  You can really see what's about to happen.
[00:41:33.276 --> 00:41:35.178]  Let's go ahead and go to this next clip.
[00:41:35.178 --> 00:41:40.184]  Pinal County Sheriff asks Obama for troops.
[00:41:40.184 --> 00:41:42.766]  This is ABC 15 locally.
[00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:45.149]  They are begging for troops.
[00:41:45.149 --> 00:41:47.572]  Begging in a mayday situation.
[00:41:48.917 --> 00:41:51.499]  Three counties deep in Arizona.
[00:41:51.499 --> 00:41:59.744]  They've got a map of where the feds have put up signs off major highways, national parks.
[00:41:59.744 --> 00:42:04.528]  There's two national parks, Pike, Oregon, and one other, and they're just saying, don't even go into these.
[00:42:05.609 --> 00:42:06.049]  You know what?
[00:42:06.049 --> 00:42:07.349]  I may not go to the Gulf, folks.
[00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:08.230]  I may go to Arizona.
[00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.370]  Everybody's saying, go to the Gulf, show us dead dolphins, show us dead turtles.
[00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:12.611]  Everybody knows about that.
[00:42:12.611 --> 00:42:15.671]  Everybody knows that BP's going around kicking people off the beach.
[00:42:15.671 --> 00:42:16.092]  I mean, what?
[00:42:16.092 --> 00:42:18.532]  Yeah, that might get a million YouTube views.
[00:42:18.532 --> 00:42:21.673]  You know, having BP tell me, get off the beach, and me arguing with him, and what?
[00:42:21.673 --> 00:42:22.933]  Getting handcuffed, slapped on me?
[00:42:22.933 --> 00:42:25.234]  How many times have you seen that?
[00:42:25.234 --> 00:42:25.474]  You know?
[00:42:25.474 --> 00:42:27.894]  I mean, is that what you want to see?
[00:42:27.894 --> 00:42:30.055]  No, I think I may have to go to these areas that are shut down.
[00:42:31.397 --> 00:42:33.098]  I think that may be where I'm going next.
[00:42:33.098 --> 00:42:35.098]  I think I'm going into the bush.
[00:42:35.098 --> 00:42:38.579]  I'm not going to go run around and look at dead dolphins, folks.
[00:42:38.579 --> 00:42:38.939]  I don't know.
[00:42:38.939 --> 00:42:40.220]  I don't know.
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.380]  It makes me so sick.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.181]  Let's go ahead and play this next clip.
[00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:45.821]  Here it is, America.
[00:42:45.821 --> 00:42:46.161]  Here it is.
[00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:51.303]  We're all over the world in Afghanistan for the opium and Iraq for the oil and the weapons and all the rest of it.
[00:42:51.303 --> 00:42:53.984]  We're about to attack Iran and our aircraft carriers are over there.
[00:42:55.385 --> 00:43:00.887]  Same propaganda they use in Iraq, but we can't defend America.
[00:43:00.887 --> 00:43:04.728]  And our newspapers can't even call these people illegal aliens.
[00:43:04.728 --> 00:43:09.249]  The criminal mobs of Latin America pouring in.
[00:43:09.249 --> 00:43:11.950]  Oh, you murder somebody in Venezuela?
[00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.650]  You murder somebody in Panama?
[00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.970]  You murder somebody in Mexico?
[00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.011]  Oh, you killed your wife?
[00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:18.951]  Oh, you got caught swindling somebody?
[00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:20.792]  Hey, just come to America, change your name and
[00:43:22.503 --> 00:43:24.284]  There's no extraditions going on.
[00:43:24.284 --> 00:43:27.004]  Mexico won't extradite people up here.
[00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:30.265]  Vice versa, so just knock yourselves out.
[00:43:30.265 --> 00:43:35.087]  But I, as a citizen, am looked at like a T-bone steak by the police.
[00:43:35.087 --> 00:43:37.648]  My family is the potatoes.
[00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:42.429]  I'm seen as a meal, as a snack, because I'm known as the right whale.
[00:43:42.429 --> 00:43:47.351]  You've heard my analogy of why the right whales were down to just a few hundred, they estimate, by the 1940s.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.202]  There were once tens of thousands of them over the entire ocean blue.
[00:43:53.202 --> 00:43:53.583]  But right?
[00:43:53.583 --> 00:43:54.243]  Whales are sweet.
[00:43:54.243 --> 00:43:55.544]  They'll come up and bump your boat.
[00:43:55.544 --> 00:43:59.526]  They come over and nuzzle divers.
[00:43:59.526 --> 00:44:00.827]  Sperm whale will attack you.
[00:44:00.827 --> 00:44:02.348]  A killer whale occasionally will attack.
[00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:04.730]  But they're all still pretty friendly, unless you're their prey.
[00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.632]  Giant squid to the sperm whale.
[00:44:07.632 --> 00:44:10.473]  Seals or sharks to the killer whale.
[00:44:10.473 --> 00:44:12.515]  King of the sea, they eat blue whales.
[00:44:14.022 --> 00:44:15.223]  Amazing video.
[00:44:15.223 --> 00:44:19.266]  Have you ever seen that stuff online of a pack of killer whales?
[00:44:19.266 --> 00:44:21.288]  Killing a blue whale and its calf.
[00:44:21.288 --> 00:44:22.009]  Drowning them.
[00:44:22.009 --> 00:44:23.990]  Pushing them under.
[00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.592]  Drowned.
[00:44:25.592 --> 00:44:27.293]  My mother says, stop saying drownded.
[00:44:27.293 --> 00:44:29.215]  I don't say drowsy drowned.
[00:44:29.215 --> 00:44:31.557]  Drownding.
[00:44:31.557 --> 00:44:34.779]  The point is, is that right whales aren't like that.
[00:44:34.779 --> 00:44:39.123]  Right whales are sweet and friendly and nice.
[00:44:39.123 --> 00:44:41.104]  They swim up to the whale boats to be killed.
[00:44:41.104 --> 00:44:41.745]  And that's us.
[00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:42.726]  We're just the right whale.
[00:44:43.868 --> 00:44:48.250]  We're known the world over as the ultimate dunces.
[00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:52.452]  And our yuppies laugh and giggle at threats, and laugh and giggle at corruption.
[00:44:52.452 --> 00:44:56.153]  I've seen the spirit, it's a spirit of wanton destruction.
[00:44:56.153 --> 00:44:58.534]  A spirit of wanting to go into bondage.
[00:44:58.534 --> 00:45:06.498]  And just like the prophets of old told Israel when Israel became corrupt and decadent over and over again, you're gonna go into bondage, you're gonna go into bondage, you're decadent.
[00:45:06.498 --> 00:45:09.239]  You know, you're worldly, you're gonna go into bondage, and they went into bondage.
[00:45:10.834 --> 00:45:11.454]  It's the same thing.
[00:45:11.454 --> 00:45:12.935]  Ever seen Pinocchio?
[00:45:12.935 --> 00:45:15.016]  It's great to show your children.
[00:45:15.016 --> 00:45:18.117]  I think it's the one Disney film that really does have a good message.
[00:45:18.117 --> 00:45:20.698]  Pinocchio.
[00:45:20.698 --> 00:45:26.101]  How does he become a real boy when he finally has courage and puts himself on the line for others?
[00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:28.482]  But first he has to go through tribulations.
[00:45:28.482 --> 00:45:29.062]  Pinocchio.
[00:45:30.325 --> 00:45:33.849]  It's taken to Pleasure Island.
[00:45:33.849 --> 00:45:50.265]  He gets picked up by young street hooligans when he's skipping school and goes to Pleasure Island and drinks and smokes and parties and brags and gets to engage in vandalism and then that spiritually weakens him so he can be turned into a jackass to be a slave pulling coal wagons.
[00:45:51.684 --> 00:45:55.806]  Of course, before that, he gets enslaved another time, following the hooligans.
[00:45:55.806 --> 00:46:03.989]  He goes into the gypsy camp and gets picked up by Stromboli, and uses a slave, a carnival act.
[00:46:03.989 --> 00:46:06.610]  Stromboli acted like his friend, though.
[00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:15.994]  See, and how many times when you were young did you get conned and manipulated by bad people, and now you're 30, 40, 50 years old, you can look back and say, man, I wish I knew then what I know now.
[00:46:17.765 --> 00:46:18.746]  I wish I had the wisdom.
[00:46:18.746 --> 00:46:23.030]  And as an adult, you try to give your children that wisdom, but they're programmed not to listen.
[00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.832]  They've got to experience it.
[00:46:24.832 --> 00:46:25.813]  There's different ways to learn.
[00:46:25.813 --> 00:46:35.742]  You can learn by experience, but the best way to learn is from others' mistakes.
[00:46:35.742 --> 00:46:39.385]  The best way to learn is being able to see what others have gone through.
[00:46:39.385 --> 00:46:41.828]  And we know, those that know history,
[00:46:44.537 --> 00:46:46.137]  Can control the future.
[00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:49.098]  Those that don't know history and the past are doomed to repeat it.
[00:46:49.098 --> 00:46:54.119]  All right, let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:59.881]  As America goes into bondage, as the borders are artificially imploded, a stage crisis.
[00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:03.402]  All county sheriff asking President Obama to send troops.
[00:47:03.402 --> 00:47:10.143]  Sheriff Paul Babu says Mexican drug cartels now control parts of Arizona all the way up to Metro Phoenix.
[00:47:10.143 --> 00:47:12.424]  ABC 15's Mariella Resendez has his plea.
[00:47:14.468 --> 00:47:15.311]  We're good to go.
[00:47:18.016 --> 00:47:27.459]  A 911 distress call from two men shot in what investigators say is part of an ongoing battle between Mexican drug cartels in what is now known as the Smuggling Corridor.
[00:47:27.459 --> 00:47:36.961]  Drug cartels control this area and this is unacceptable and local law enforcement cannot handle and stop this on our own.
[00:47:36.961 --> 00:47:44.043]  Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babu says drug violence is far past the border, spilling into the communities.
[00:47:44.043 --> 00:47:46.304]  Hiking areas now have warning signs posted
[00:47:46.624 --> 00:47:53.148]  Where military armed drug cartels are frequently photographed making drug deliveries to vehicles on Highway 8.
[00:47:53.148 --> 00:47:59.232]  We are outgunned, we are outmanned, and we don't have the resources here locally for us to fight this.
[00:47:59.232 --> 00:48:05.016]  Five weeks ago, a Pinal County deputy was ambushed and shot as he tracked six drug smuggling suspects.
[00:48:05.016 --> 00:48:09.619]  Several times the caller told operators to look for him where the sheriff had been shot.
[00:48:09.619 --> 00:48:12.441]  Some of the information he gave had not been released.
[00:48:13.081 --> 00:48:17.663]  Sheriff Baviu says the issue is too much for local law enforcement.
[00:48:17.663 --> 00:48:23.265]  What is needed truly is we're looking at 3,000 soldiers alone for Arizona.
[00:48:23.265 --> 00:48:26.486]  In Pinal County, Mary Ellen Resendiz, ABC 15 News.
[00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:29.813]  So, you want to live as third world slaves?
[00:48:29.813 --> 00:48:30.673]  You are.
[00:48:30.673 --> 00:48:33.034]  Now, let's go to the key to all of this.
[00:48:33.034 --> 00:48:42.237]  Senator Kyle, town hall meeting just a few days ago, saying he was in a closed door meeting with Obama and Obama said, I'm not going to fix the border.
[00:48:42.237 --> 00:48:45.679]  I want to use that as a crisis.
[00:48:45.679 --> 00:48:47.780]  And this is telling somebody from another political party.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.241]  Can you imagine what he really says?
[00:48:50.241 --> 00:48:54.062]  We're going to use this crisis to force everybody to accept the amnesty plan.
[00:48:54.062 --> 00:48:54.382]  Here it is.
[00:48:57.196 --> 00:48:58.016]  Why?
[00:48:58.016 --> 00:49:01.117]  I'll tell you why.
[00:49:01.117 --> 00:49:05.578]  I met with the President in the Oval Office, just the two of us.
[00:49:05.578 --> 00:49:08.298]  I kicked the rest of the people out.
[00:49:08.298 --> 00:49:11.078]  I asked them if they would leave.
[00:49:11.078 --> 00:49:11.919]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:11.919 --> 00:49:13.659]  And we had a discussion about it.
[00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:21.840]  Well, one was General Jones, the National Security Advisor, and I... Here's what the President said.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.021]  The problem is, he said, if we secure the border,
[00:49:26.052 --> 00:49:30.713]  Then you all won't have any reason to support Comprehensive Immigration Reform.
[00:49:30.713 --> 00:49:34.534]  In other words, they're calling it hostage.
[00:49:34.534 --> 00:49:41.676]  They don't want to secure the border unless and until it is combined with Comprehensive Immigration Reform.
[00:49:41.676 --> 00:49:44.837]  Now, I explain.
[00:49:44.837 --> 00:49:49.319]  You and I, Mr. President, have an obligation to secure the border.
[00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:50.499]  That's an obligation.
[00:49:51.644 --> 00:49:55.028]  It also has some potentially positive benefits.
[00:49:55.028 --> 00:50:00.714]  You don't have to have comprehensive reform to secure the border, but you have to secure the border to get comprehensive reform.
[00:50:00.714 --> 00:50:02.356]  I said, you'd be surprised.
[00:50:02.356 --> 00:50:08.522]  Maybe you don't think that there would be any more incentive for comprehensive reform, but I'm not so sure that that's true.
[00:50:10.353 --> 00:50:21.000]  You know, the issue here is that that's the North American SPP CFR plan that they wrote in 2005 and that you see them secretly discussing in the SPP North American Union meetings.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.883]  They said we're going to have a hemispheric ID, now it's been introduced, and everyone from Canada, U.S.
[00:50:25.883 --> 00:50:29.365]  and Mexico will travel however they want inside the North American corridor.
[00:50:29.365 --> 00:50:34.848]  The highways will be internationally seeded, 83 of them, and will fund the new North American government.
[00:50:34.848 --> 00:50:37.270]  The major highways will have tolls on it paid to the new government.
[00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:42.835]  Uh, and illegals will just be legalized.
[00:50:42.835 --> 00:50:48.500]  And then they claim they might secure some of the borders from drug smuggling, which they have no intention of doing.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.961]  So, there you have it, folks.
[00:50:49.961 --> 00:50:51.062]  High treason.
[00:50:51.062 --> 00:50:52.884]  No other way to slice it.
[00:50:52.884 --> 00:50:54.505]  They are holding America hostage.
[00:50:54.505 --> 00:50:55.206]  You heard a U.S.
[00:50:55.206 --> 00:50:55.927]  Senator.
[00:50:55.927 --> 00:50:57.688]  Obama is holding us hostage.
[00:50:57.688 --> 00:50:58.269]  So was Bush.
[00:51:00.643 --> 00:51:03.025]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:51:03.025 --> 00:51:05.346]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:51:05.346 --> 00:51:08.549]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:13.672]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:51:13.672 --> 00:51:17.855]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:20.519]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:51:20.519 --> 00:51:23.063]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:51:23.063 --> 00:51:26.327]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:51:26.327 --> 00:51:33.919]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:51:34.259 --> 00:51:39.641]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:51:39.641 --> 00:51:41.962]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:51:41.962 --> 00:51:46.183]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:51:46.183 --> 00:51:47.264]  And I got news for you.
[00:51:47.264 --> 00:51:48.584]  You're everyone else.
[00:51:48.584 --> 00:51:50.085]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.861 --> 00:53:01.162]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.162 --> 00:53:06.745]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:06.745 --> 00:53:11.767]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:11.767 --> 00:53:17.350]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:22.573]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:22.573 --> 00:53:24.434]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:53:24.881 --> 00:53:29.685]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:29.685 --> 00:53:30.806]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:30.806 --> 00:53:33.869]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:53:33.869 --> 00:53:37.492]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.492 --> 00:53:40.695]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:40.695 --> 00:53:42.897]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:42.897 --> 00:53:43.778]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:43.778 --> 00:53:44.018]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:52.645 --> 00:54:10.013]  Now, we've covered what's happening in Arizona.
[00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:10.893]  It's the hardest hit.
[00:54:10.893 --> 00:54:16.796]  Mexico, of course, is in a lot worse shape than Arizona.
[00:54:16.796 --> 00:54:22.078]  Texas is in bad shape, then New Mexico, and then, of course, California.
[00:54:24.286 --> 00:54:35.794]  It is a failed giant third world state whose population has doubled in the last 30 years and is set to double again in the next 25.
[00:54:35.794 --> 00:54:42.759]  Most analysts agree that Mexico is probably going to completely collapse into total road warrior in the next 12 months.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.281]  It already has in most areas.
[00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:53.848]  When I was playing those video clips off the news, it just showed dead bodies everywhere, burning buildings, armored vehicles, troops running, dead cops, people kidnapped.
[00:54:53.848 --> 00:54:56.910]  I mean, to just hear the audio on the radio is nothing.
[00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:00.894]  Go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and actually watch the videos.
[00:55:00.894 --> 00:55:09.680]  Now, all of that is one thing, but another thing is the federal government has now announced they're going to sue Arizona and other cities
[00:55:10.711 --> 00:55:14.472]  In fact, the Fed sued Farmer's Branch last year and won.
[00:55:14.472 --> 00:55:23.836]  Farmer's Branch said that they were going to ask illegals for ID, which citizens have to show when you get an apartment, but the illegals don't.
[00:55:23.836 --> 00:55:27.497]  Again, they're exempt because they're lawless, and the system wants them here.
[00:55:27.497 --> 00:55:29.738]  It's kind of like the bankers.
[00:55:29.738 --> 00:55:31.019]  Congress says, where's the $2 trillion?
[00:55:31.019 --> 00:55:31.999]  Where's this $500 billion?
[00:55:31.999 --> 00:55:33.079]  Where's this $800 billion?
[00:55:33.079 --> 00:55:34.700]  We're not going to tell you.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.261]  Mr. Bernanke, you're not going to tell me.
[00:55:36.261 --> 00:55:37.121]  No, I'm not going to tell you.
[00:55:38.917 --> 00:55:42.701]  Geithner, Chairman Geithner, Secretary Geithner, where is the money?
[00:55:42.701 --> 00:55:44.663]  I'm not going to tell you.
[00:55:44.663 --> 00:55:45.764]  No, I'm not going to tell you.
[00:55:45.764 --> 00:55:47.926]  Because you represent our slaves.
[00:55:47.926 --> 00:55:49.848]  Shut up, Congressman.
[00:55:49.848 --> 00:55:51.030]  I mean, this government...
[00:55:51.957 --> 00:55:54.038]  This government thinks you're so dumb.
[00:55:54.038 --> 00:55:58.160]  They come out in the Washington Post and admit they put out fake Bin Laden videos.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.301]  Folks, it's all fake, okay?
[00:56:00.301 --> 00:56:01.881]  Oh, are there real Muslims that want to kill you?
[00:56:01.881 --> 00:56:03.002]  Oh, sure.
[00:56:03.002 --> 00:56:11.885]  Most of them are funded by the CIA through their imams above them, and the mindless automatons that are out carrying out the attacks really think they're doing it for Allah.
[00:56:11.885 --> 00:56:12.846]  They're being handled.
[00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:24.978]  You better realize how duplicitous things are and realize that the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, is the only hedge of protection this Republic has, my friends.
[00:56:24.978 --> 00:56:34.927]  It is the only hedge of protection that this society has, and that when you lose your due process and your Bill of Rights, you are wide open to every criminal element.
[00:56:34.927 --> 00:56:40.212]  And so there's a great headline here, amid crisis, Obama declares war on Arizona, out of the Examiner.
[00:56:43.114 --> 00:56:48.117]  The Obama Administration has a lot of fights on its hands, putting aside real wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:56:48.117 --> 00:57:00.546]  There's the battle against leaking oil in the Gulf, the struggle against 9.7% unemployment, more like 25, 23 is what the big industry is putting out, across the country, and clashes over the President's agenda on Capitol Hill.
[00:57:00.546 --> 00:57:06.150]  Despite all that, the White House has found time to issue a new declaration of war, this time against an unlikely enemy, the state of Arizona.
[00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:10.132]  We're going to cover that more coming up in the next hour.
[00:57:12.867 --> 00:57:15.909]  Nebraska City votes to restrict illegal immigration.
[00:57:15.909 --> 00:57:19.531]  AP reports the Feds declare they're going to run and block that.
[00:57:19.531 --> 00:57:31.659]  One of Obama's czars over labor has got TV ads taxpayer paid for running telling illegal aliens to tattle on their employers if they're not being paid full wage.
[00:57:31.659 --> 00:57:32.720]  That'll actually backfire.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:40.325]  Then people that are exploiting the illegal alien slave class of labor, they may now actually get in trouble.
[00:57:42.942 --> 00:57:45.483]  Oh man, that's good.
[00:57:45.483 --> 00:57:47.484]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are in free fall.
[00:57:47.484 --> 00:58:03.511]  Mexico's only hope, and I pray for the people of Mexico, they're good people deep down, they've just never had freedom, they've always been under dominance of evil, whether it was the Aztecs, or the Mayan culture that it grew from, or the Conquistadors.
[00:58:03.511 --> 00:58:03.871]  All of it.
[00:58:05.174 --> 00:58:06.495]  It doesn't matter.
[00:58:06.495 --> 00:58:07.796]  They've never had a chance at freedom.
[00:58:07.796 --> 00:58:09.377]  They're good people.
[00:58:09.377 --> 00:58:12.339]  But we need to help patriots in Mexico.
[00:58:12.339 --> 00:58:13.340]  We need to have Washington.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:19.524]  We need to take Washington back because Washington is manipulating Mexico and teaming up with the tyranny down there to oppress their people.
[00:58:20.953 --> 00:58:23.034]  We need, though, to not allow the U.S.
[00:58:23.034 --> 00:58:29.278]  to be used as a political steam valve and to let the Mexican people be brainwashed into tools against the United States by the bankers.
[00:58:29.278 --> 00:58:30.239]  All right.
[00:58:30.239 --> 00:58:34.101]  Next hour coming up, don't forget the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:34.101 --> 00:58:42.366]  The most powerful titles, videos, and books and t-shirts all available at InfoWars.com.

[00:58:49.875 --> 00:58:54.438]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.438 --> 00:58:55.338]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.338 --> 00:58:58.781]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.781 --> 00:58:59.641]  Number 2.
[00:58:59.641 --> 00:59:04.524]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.524 --> 00:59:05.265]  It's true.
[00:59:05.265 --> 00:59:10.148]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.148 --> 00:59:10.968]  Number 3.
[00:59:10.968 --> 00:59:14.551]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:18.253]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.453 --> 00:59:19.253]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.253 --> 00:59:22.014]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.014 --> 00:59:25.695]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:26.475]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.475 --> 00:59:30.636]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.636 --> 00:59:35.678]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.678 --> 00:59:39.859]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:39.859 --> 00:59:41.640]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.241]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:54.030]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network Big Brother
[01:00:06.426 --> 01:00:08.207]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.207 --> 01:00:09.968]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.968 --> 01:00:11.549]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:13.111]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.111 --> 01:00:17.293]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.293 --> 01:00:21.356]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.102]  We're now into our number two, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:35.102 --> 01:00:36.423]  We're going to open the phones up.
[01:00:36.423 --> 01:00:38.384]  Coming up in an hour and a half, Alan Watt.
[01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:39.085]  Always informative.
[01:00:39.085 --> 01:00:40.926]  He's going to join us for the balance of the transmission.
[01:00:40.926 --> 01:00:41.846]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:41.886]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:49.791 --> 01:01:01.565]  You can call in about the Gulf oil spill and the former head of Mossad and the current Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu separately saying that they are looking seriously at attacking Iran.
[01:01:01.565 --> 01:01:03.667]  They believe that a green light is the way to go.
[01:01:04.648 --> 01:01:07.691]  Just amazing, incredible economic developments.
[01:01:07.691 --> 01:01:13.916]  But I do want to hear your take on sheriffs all over Texas and Arizona begging for help.
[01:01:13.916 --> 01:01:15.137]  Sheriff's deputies being killed.
[01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:17.138]  Illegal aliens running around everywhere.
[01:01:17.138 --> 01:01:17.799]  Drug dealing.
[01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:22.322]  80 to 100 to even 150 miles into Arizona.
[01:01:22.322 --> 01:01:25.805]  Signs up saying don't go into national parks, don't go into areas.
[01:01:25.805 --> 01:01:26.866]  It's too violent.
[01:01:26.866 --> 01:01:28.868]  People being robbed, kidnapped, killed.
[01:01:28.868 --> 01:01:29.969]  Mexico collapsing.
[01:01:30.649 --> 01:01:32.990]  And Obama says he's going to sue Arizona.
[01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.492]  They're not even allowed to arrest illegal aliens.
[01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:38.133]  They've got to just let them run wild and do whatever they want.
[01:01:38.133 --> 01:01:43.916]  As Senator Kyle said in a meeting with Obama, Obama said, we're holding the American people hostage.
[01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:48.698]  We are not going to let there be any control of the border until they accept amnesty.
[01:01:48.698 --> 01:01:51.180]  That's what the immigration reform is.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.083]  Every time they bring it out, it's just, well, we legalize all the illegals.
[01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:56.604]  So they won't have to walk across.
[01:01:56.604 --> 01:01:59.306]  They're still going to be bringing the cocaine across, folks.
[01:01:59.306 --> 01:02:03.590]  And what you do is you decriminalize that, and if somebody's dumb enough to use it, dumb enough to have a heart attack.
[01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:06.132]  I mean, people can get high off stuff under the kitchen sink.
[01:02:06.132 --> 01:02:08.114]  Do we ban all of that?
[01:02:08.114 --> 01:02:09.115]  No!
[01:02:09.115 --> 01:02:15.861]  When cocaine and heroin were legal, a lot less Americans were using it, when it was in every drugstore in the country until the 1930s.
[01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:18.963]  But they made it illegal, then it had money involved, then it became trendy.
[01:02:19.887 --> 01:02:39.221]  And now people are breaking in your house to get money for the illegal drugs, your daughter is out whoring herself out to get the drugs, whereas she could just get it at the drugstore and then get into treatment and she never would have used it before because it wouldn't have been promoted as cool and avant-garde and trendy.
[01:02:39.221 --> 01:02:44.084]  The globalists know what they're doing and this is designed to implode Mexico and the U.S.
[01:02:44.084 --> 01:02:44.464]  next.
[01:02:44.464 --> 01:02:48.227]  So what are we going to do about it and how do we help Mexico get some freedom?
[01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:51.420]  Man, Mexico could be a jewel.
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.001]  All Latin America should be.
[01:02:53.001 --> 01:03:12.312]  Beautiful land, amazing resources, very interesting, deep culture, great art, innovations, but no, they've got corrupt governments, just like every other government in the world.
[01:03:12.312 --> 01:03:17.896]  The United States was never perfect, but it had that special property right, it had that special middle class, it had that Christian
[01:03:19.551 --> 01:03:22.272]  Ethic that founded this nation.
[01:03:22.272 --> 01:03:25.173]  We weren't perfect, but we tried to keep the evil in check.
[01:03:25.173 --> 01:03:27.933]  We tried to keep government small, knowing it was the great danger.
[01:03:27.933 --> 01:03:30.234]  And so we became the wealthiest nation on earth.
[01:03:30.234 --> 01:03:35.536]  Now we've been taken over and used as an engine of global domination.
[01:03:35.536 --> 01:03:38.416]  I will be news blitzing at the bottom of the hour, continuing with your calls.
[01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:40.817]  Even when Alan Watts is not with us, we're going to have open phones today.
[01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.798]  So again, 1-800-259-9231 and have your comment or question ready.
[01:03:48.274 --> 01:03:52.617]  And I'm going to get into Google, Apple, and others are in deep trouble.
[01:03:52.617 --> 01:03:56.861]  The French government's looking at criminal charges.
[01:03:56.861 --> 01:03:58.442]  Upwards of 18 U.S.
[01:03:58.442 --> 01:04:00.623]  Attorney Generals are looking at criminal charges.
[01:04:00.623 --> 01:04:03.025]  Oh, excuse me, it's 20 now.
[01:04:03.025 --> 01:04:05.367]  Sorry, last week it was 18, now it's 20.
[01:04:05.367 --> 01:04:07.168]  Oh, one other correction, too.
[01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:10.391]  The media keeps saying 30,000 foot well, so I've just been parroting that.
[01:04:10.391 --> 01:04:12.793]  And I got an IM saying, not an IM, an email,
[01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:14.826]  That I am to the guys.
[01:04:14.826 --> 01:04:25.171]  In fact, it's in my stack here, where the guy basically said, uh, Hey Alex, the well is 4,000 feet on the sea floor, not 5,000.
[01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:26.691]  Okay, the news said 5,000.
[01:04:26.691 --> 01:04:30.853]  And it's not a 30,000 foot well, it's 18,500 feet.
[01:04:30.853 --> 01:04:34.975]  And I went and looked it up, and that is indeed the depth.
[01:04:34.975 --> 01:04:35.915]  That's not even that deep.
[01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:38.476]  I wouldn't even call that super deep.
[01:04:38.476 --> 01:04:42.298]  But our guests have been calling it 30,000, everybody else hasn't, so you gotta watch statistics.
[01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:45.752]  Uh, so I'd correct it on that front.
[01:04:45.752 --> 01:04:47.093]  Thank you.
[01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:57.801]  Um... Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are gonna come back and go to your phone calls and then a lot of other really, really important news today.
[01:04:57.801 --> 01:04:58.702]  Please stay with us.

[01:05:04.336 --> 01:05:10.740]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:18.124]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:18.124 --> 01:05:22.667]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:05:35.924 --> 01:05:39.027]  As founder and owner for over 63 years,
[01:05:39.588 --> 01:05:42.689]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:46.570]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.326]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.326 --> 01:06:09.068]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:11.490]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:17.373]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:23.617]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.017 --> 01:06:29.979]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:29.979 --> 01:06:34.180]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:38.461]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:44.423]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:44.423 --> 01:06:47.984]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:47.984 --> 01:06:49.945]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:49.945 --> 01:06:50.385]  It's here.

[01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.927]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.927 --> 01:08:06.730]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.864 --> 01:08:14.306]  Tropical storm may pose threat to BP spill cleanup.
[01:08:14.306 --> 01:08:15.986]  Bloomberg's reporting.
[01:08:15.986 --> 01:08:20.047]  The hurricane season starts officially in about two months.
[01:08:20.047 --> 01:08:36.293]  Of course, the currents, and you can see the satellite photos up on the NASA Earth View website, is carrying most of the oil east off the coast of Louisiana and around Florida and up the east coast.
[01:08:36.293 --> 01:08:38.574]  But when hurricanes and tropical storms hit,
[01:08:39.824 --> 01:08:55.756]  The weather experts have reported, the hydrologists have reported, that it will start driving a lot of that oil that's just massing out in the Gulf into Texas and Mexico, not just Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida.
[01:08:55.756 --> 01:09:00.860]  And I hate to be selfish, but almost at a subconscious level, I'm like, oh, I love the Texas coast, you know, grew up
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.701]  Going down there, and I hate seeing the Florida beaches ruined that I've been to a few times.
[01:09:05.701 --> 01:09:10.642]  I hate seeing the beautiful Louisiana beaches and Mississippi and Alabama.
[01:09:10.642 --> 01:09:17.723]  But I tell you, it's just horrible to know that it's going to hit other areas of the Gulf as well.
[01:09:17.723 --> 01:09:19.983]  I just wish it wasn't hitting anybody.
[01:09:19.983 --> 01:09:24.784]  But tropical storm may pose threat to BP spill cleanup.
[01:09:24.784 --> 01:09:29.385]  Carl Larry, President of Oil Outlooks and Opinions, LLC, talks to BP's
[01:09:30.525 --> 01:09:35.529]  20 billion fund to pay claims associated with the oil leak for its well in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:09:35.529 --> 01:09:44.516]  Larry also discussed BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward's efforts to drill relief wells and his investment strategy for oil companies.
[01:09:44.516 --> 01:09:55.123]  The first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season may enter the Gulf of Mexico as soon as next week, possibly disrupting BP's efforts to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S.
[01:09:55.123 --> 01:09:55.484]  history.
[01:09:56.244 --> 01:10:09.836]  Thunderstorms in the Caribbean may strengthen into a tropical storm this week before heading into the Gulf between Mexico and Cuba, said Jim Rollier, a senior energy meteorologist in Pennsylvania.
[01:10:09.836 --> 01:10:16.782]  The first named tropical storm of the 2010 season appears more likely to form over the northeastern Caribbean late this week.
[01:10:17.402 --> 01:10:24.125]  Uh, and we'll go on to represent a formidable threat in the Gulf, along with heightening concerns about the oil slick.
[01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:33.688]  Uh, he said, forecasters are predicting this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1st to June 30th, may be among the most active on record.
[01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:41.151]  Yeah, look at, uh, what's happening right now in the U.S., how much rain and the deadly storms we're having that killed all those people, uh, in, um...
[01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:45.612]  Arkansas killed a bunch of people in South Texas.
[01:10:45.612 --> 01:10:48.354]  They had over a foot and a half of rain in one day.
[01:10:48.354 --> 01:10:51.296]  Most of it fell in one hour in New Braunfels two weeks ago.
[01:10:51.296 --> 01:11:00.263]  I was going to take my kids down to Slitterbine that weekend and turn on the news to check it out and it was just completely flooded.
[01:11:00.263 --> 01:11:06.727]  Nobody died at Slitterbine but they died at a campground down the Comal River.
[01:11:06.727 --> 01:11:07.388]  It was just horrible.
[01:11:08.712 --> 01:11:11.374]  One foot of rain in an hour, my friends.
[01:11:11.374 --> 01:11:17.018]  So, yeah, it looks to be a doozy this year, right on time for this spill.
[01:11:17.018 --> 01:11:21.781]  Also, BP oil spill leak found in rig weeks before blast.
[01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:23.663]  And, of course, that's the London Telegraph.
[01:11:23.663 --> 01:11:26.625]  First it was two weeks, then it was a month, now it's two months.
[01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:28.966]  And I don't understand all the technicalities of this, okay?
[01:11:28.966 --> 01:11:33.870]  I don't drill oil wells, but I've read the Coast Guard hearings from weeks ago, and
[01:11:37.099 --> 01:11:44.980]  If you can get in as a petroleum geologist, we'd like you to explain this to us, or as an engineer, or as a petroleum engineer.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:12:02.083]  But all I know is that it said that the rig operators at Anadarko and, of course, Halliburton, and I don't love Halliburton, I've been critical of Halliburton and its corruption and its no-bids, but the facts are Halliburton was on record complaining to BP.
[01:12:02.083 --> 01:12:03.864]  They were contractors.
[01:12:03.864 --> 01:12:05.744]  And that's in the hearings that the
[01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:12.751]  Halliburton and the Anadarko people, and you notice that's why it's in the news today.
[01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:20.052]  People are saying, why won't BP, 60 plus days into this, sue Anadarko or other companies that were involved?
[01:12:20.052 --> 01:12:23.073]  Because they told them what to do, and that's come out in the hearings.
[01:12:23.073 --> 01:12:28.114]  Now, I've described it on air as they were dumping seawater in, which is unheard of.
[01:12:28.114 --> 01:12:31.855]  Now, seawater being dumped in is going on during the drilling.
[01:12:31.855 --> 01:12:33.895]  What happened was, though, that it was done
[01:12:38.757 --> 01:12:42.142]  Instead of putting in the cement and the mud is the way it's been described.
[01:12:42.142 --> 01:12:49.151]  So that's what's unprecedented and what made the engineers so mad and why they're on record in those hearings saying they said it was going to blow up and cause a problem.
[01:12:49.151 --> 01:12:52.355]  And this continued even after they were having the problems.
[01:12:53.627 --> 01:12:56.629]  But you can go read the Coast Guard reports for yourself about this.
[01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:59.310]  Bottom line is they knew what they were doing when BP gave those orders.
[01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:04.993]  They were told by the rig operators, by both the contractor group heads, that this is going to blow up.
[01:13:04.993 --> 01:13:05.994]  This is unheard of.
[01:13:05.994 --> 01:13:07.334]  This is crazy what you're doing.
[01:13:07.334 --> 01:13:09.035]  The way they did this well.
[01:13:09.035 --> 01:13:12.197]  BP oil spill leak found in rig weeks before blast.
[01:13:12.197 --> 01:13:19.881]  The Deepwater Horizon rig, which exploded causing the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, had suffered a leak in the weeks leading up to the blast, an employee has claimed.
[01:13:19.881 --> 01:13:21.702]  And it goes on from there.
[01:13:23.598 --> 01:13:25.720]  Okay, that's enough of that.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:41.799]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls, and then I'm going to get into a bunch of other news on the economy, on the Iran situation, on Google in big trouble being an NSA front all over Europe, all over the US, all over England, all over Australia, with their vans and cars that have the photo and video masked.
[01:13:45.051 --> 01:13:49.716]  Running around, grabbing all your digital data and your codes and everything.
[01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:55.162]  They knew exactly what they were doing and they're now going to be criminally charged and they should be.
[01:13:55.162 --> 01:14:01.249]  Everybody freaks out about the NSA spying on the American people.
[01:14:01.249 --> 01:14:02.811]  In the FCC proposal,
[01:14:04.616 --> 01:14:06.558]  And this is now in the AP and Financial Times of London.
[01:14:06.558 --> 01:14:08.560]  If you don't believe me, go look it up.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:19.931]  Everyone will have a black box in their home and their business and at the ISP that tracks everything you read, everything you look at, everything you do, and that will filter content and will decide what you can and can't look at.
[01:14:19.931 --> 01:14:21.032]  Now that's been announced.
[01:14:21.032 --> 01:14:23.375]  The FCC has taken over the web.
[01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:25.297]  And they say they're going to tax it and make you pay for the box.
[01:14:26.363 --> 01:14:32.726]  Now, I have another headline today up on PrisonPlanet.com, where the Australian government's announcing the same thing.
[01:14:32.726 --> 01:14:34.287]  Everybody's freaking out about it.
[01:14:34.287 --> 01:14:36.648]  This is being set up in the United States.
[01:14:36.648 --> 01:14:41.070]  We're going to go to Joe, Mark, Carl, Noel, Tony, Santa, and others right now.
[01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:42.951]  Joe in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:14:42.951 --> 01:14:45.752]  Hello, Alex, how are you, sir?
[01:14:45.752 --> 01:14:47.293]  Good, go ahead.
[01:14:47.293 --> 01:14:52.575]  Yes, sir, it just came across news where there was a
[01:14:54.246 --> 01:15:01.011]  There was an attempt on Falcon Dam down in Zapata, Texas by the cartel to blow the thing up.
[01:15:01.011 --> 01:15:03.032]  No, I saw that in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:04.213]  That came out a few weeks ago.
[01:15:04.213 --> 01:15:06.415]  In fact, I printed that and forgot.
[01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:09.157]  I printed it a week ago, I printed it this weekend, and I forgot.
[01:15:09.157 --> 01:15:14.961]  Guys, will you print Zapata plot to blow up dam that would have conservatively killed tens of thousands?
[01:15:14.961 --> 01:15:17.483]  It's Houston Chronicle and a local TV station.
[01:15:17.483 --> 01:15:21.486]  Yes, they've now said they're going to blow up dams, and the media's kept that real quiet.
[01:15:22.046 --> 01:15:27.569]  And, uh, I've succumbed to the disease that if the media, mainstream media, had made it a big deal, I didn't cover it.
[01:15:27.569 --> 01:15:28.009]  See?
[01:15:28.009 --> 01:15:28.850]  It's worse!
[01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:33.332]  Rocket attacks, hand grenade attacks, mass kidnappings, plans to blow up dams confirmed.
[01:15:33.332 --> 01:15:34.953]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:15:34.953 --> 01:15:51.381]  Yes, and, uh, I know that, I believe it was, uh, you, Alex, uh, or your team that, uh, I think a while back had investigated, or had a, uh, interviewed a sheriff down there, uh, near Zapata in Rio Grande City, which is just down the road.
[01:15:52.106 --> 01:15:56.368]  And that, what I understand, is a real, real bad hotbed down there.
[01:15:56.368 --> 01:15:59.530]  Yeah, I haven't interviewed those sheriffs in about three years.
[01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:04.112]  We had a gaggle of them on, and they all said the same thing.
[01:16:04.112 --> 01:16:12.397]  That the illegal drug cartels come to their deputies and say, I'm going to kill you and your wife and children if you don't get on the payroll.
[01:16:12.397 --> 01:16:18.260]  And so most of them go on the payroll, and some valiant sheriffs have spoken out against it, and then some of them get shot or threatened.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.722]  Uh, and if they just roll over and take the drug money, the feds are involved in it, they leave them alone.
[01:16:23.722 --> 01:16:32.444]  And, uh, yeah, if they ever do interdict cocaine or other drugs, the Mexican troops were coming in a mile, then two, then three, then four, then five, then six.
[01:16:32.444 --> 01:16:39.066]  They're now upwards of a hundred miles into Arizona and 50 miles into Texas.
[01:16:39.066 --> 01:16:40.447]  Total lawlessness.
[01:16:40.447 --> 01:16:43.588]  So, so yes, sir, we did have those sheriffs on and we should get them back on.
[01:16:44.687 --> 01:16:49.113]  Well listen, Alex, God bless for your work, sir, and we're spreading the word, too, brother.
[01:16:49.113 --> 01:16:49.814]  God bless you.
[01:16:49.814 --> 01:16:55.382]  Yeah, remember last year, folks from the National Guard in Texas sent us a document.
[01:16:55.382 --> 01:16:56.243]  They didn't say who they were.
[01:16:58.387 --> 01:17:01.008]  Smart leakers.
[01:17:01.008 --> 01:17:04.309]  I called the phone numbers and confirmed it was real.
[01:17:04.309 --> 01:17:07.410]  They simultaneously leaked it to some other publications, which is good.
[01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:10.551]  We don't want to be the only ones to get the info, folks.
[01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:14.952]  Hal, Ron, Paul, and myself are surveilled by Army intelligence.
[01:17:14.952 --> 01:17:26.856]  And it said when you go to the in-the-Fed rallies, namely in Dallas when they were there covering, and we have that in the Obama deception, by the way, they said, do not let the in-the-Fedders know that you're Army intel or they may turn into terrorists and kill you.
[01:17:28.328 --> 01:17:34.420]  So you got a bunch of women, children, men, people of all races out there peacefully bullhorning the Federal Reserve.
[01:17:35.819 --> 01:17:45.281]  And the Army's there, and they tell these Army men, and they tell these intelligence officers, that don't let them know you're Army or we may turn and kill them.
[01:17:45.281 --> 01:17:46.801]  Give me a break.
[01:17:46.801 --> 01:17:48.442]  Give me a break.
[01:17:48.442 --> 01:17:49.802]  I mean, come on.
[01:17:49.802 --> 01:17:50.042]  Come on.
[01:17:50.042 --> 01:17:53.943]  We're not the lawless criminals stealing trillions of dollars out of the Treasury.
[01:17:53.943 --> 01:17:56.023]  We're not the ones letting the borders be wide open.
[01:17:56.023 --> 01:17:59.404]  We're not the ones that use the federal government as their private cash machine.
[01:18:00.543 --> 01:18:15.918]  So see, they teach the cops that the American people are a bunch of terrorists, and that anybody who stands up for liberty and freedom and what this country is built on... Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen, what you hear on this radio show by every historical yardstick is Americana, is the Bill of Rights,
[01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.519]  Is the Constitution.
[01:18:17.519 --> 01:18:19.060]  Is what this country's founded on.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:25.403]  If you don't like this show, you don't like the Founding Fathers, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution.
[01:18:25.403 --> 01:18:27.424]  You don't like America.
[01:18:27.424 --> 01:18:30.086]  See, all of you telling us that we're the bad people.
[01:18:30.086 --> 01:18:32.967]  And Homeland Security and Obama saying we're dangerous terrorists.
[01:18:32.967 --> 01:18:34.288]  And Chris Matthews saying it.
[01:18:34.288 --> 01:18:35.889]  That's because they're terrorists, folks.
[01:18:35.889 --> 01:18:36.590]  They're the people.
[01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:37.870]  They're the revolutionaries.
[01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:42.433]  They're the ones that have come in here and turned this country into a giant criminal operation.
[01:18:43.598 --> 01:18:58.793]  By the way, even NBC's reporting that the reason that they're talking about kicking Rahm Emanuel, the real president, to the curb is because he is coming out in the federal tapes and in the court hearings as getting payoffs with Blagojevich.
[01:18:58.793 --> 01:19:00.755]  Well, of course, they came up together.
[01:19:00.755 --> 01:19:01.676]  Of course, it's on record.
[01:19:01.676 --> 01:19:04.499]  He got a house from BP, an apartment for years.
[01:19:04.499 --> 01:19:05.420]  A million dollar apartment.
[01:19:06.727 --> 01:19:08.629]  It's open and shut.
[01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:13.412]  This is a mafia group of brazen criminals, okay?
[01:19:13.412 --> 01:19:15.974]  The government's been overrun by crooks.
[01:19:15.974 --> 01:19:18.516]  Of course they're saying they want to arrest me.
[01:19:18.516 --> 01:19:21.038]  Of course they're demonizing Ron Paul and Rand Paul.
[01:19:21.038 --> 01:19:22.619]  They're criminals.
[01:19:22.619 --> 01:19:25.301]  They're a pack of criminals.
[01:19:25.301 --> 01:19:30.686]  And if you think you're going to side with them because the news, you know, are you Republican, are you Democrat?
[01:19:30.686 --> 01:19:32.567]  You're supposed to pick a criminal group.
[01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:33.568]  Here it is, Houston Chronicle.
[01:19:34.975 --> 01:19:48.908]  Agents Fear Mexican Drug Cartel Attack on Border Dam Houston Chronicle Drug Cartel Plots to Blow Up Border Dam WOAI-TV And yeah, this is from 20 days ago.
[01:19:48.908 --> 01:19:49.989]  So, there you go.
[01:19:49.989 --> 01:19:52.771]  20 days late reporting on that.
[01:19:52.771 --> 01:19:54.673]  See, it's worse than I can even describe.
[01:19:54.673 --> 01:19:57.356]  Worse than I can even tell you.
[01:19:57.356 --> 01:19:58.577]  We'll be back with more of your calls.
[01:19:58.577 --> 01:19:58.977]  Stay with us.

[01:20:15.468 --> 01:20:15.648]  Mint,
[01:20:15.988 --> 01:20:17.890]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:25.977]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[01:21:05.716 --> 01:21:08.479]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:21:08.479 --> 01:21:12.944]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:24:12.484 --> 01:24:21.426]  Critics say the administration is, in effect, giving a major strip of the Southwest back to Mexico.
[01:24:21.426 --> 01:24:21.806]  U.S.
[01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:31.709]  Fish and Wildlife have closed a portion of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge all along the border, warning visitors to beware of heavily armed drug smugglers and human traffickers.
[01:24:32.409 --> 01:24:35.094]  Paul Bebeau is the sheriff in Pinal County, Arizona.
[01:24:35.094 --> 01:24:36.697]  He joins us now by phone.
[01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:39.924]  Sheriff, this is a family show, so I'm going to put it like this.
[01:24:39.924 --> 01:24:41.306]  What the heck is going on down there?
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:25:04.378]  It's literally out of control and violence has increased just in the last four months and we've been, not just as a sheriff, all of our police chiefs in Pinell County, we stood with Senator McCain and literally demanded support for 3,000 soldiers to be deployed to Arizona to get this under control and finally secure our border with Mexico.
[01:25:05.046 --> 01:25:13.268]  Alright, I gotta tell you, when I first received an email about this with these signs that are up saying, you know, don't go past this point, stay away, this is not safe.
[01:25:13.268 --> 01:25:17.188]  I mean, we're not talking about something that's sort of a Tijuana situation right at the border.
[01:25:17.188 --> 01:25:19.549]  I mean, we're talking about something that's north of Tucson.
[01:25:19.549 --> 01:25:21.969]  I mean, 80 miles away from the border?
[01:25:21.969 --> 01:25:22.870]  Exactly.
[01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:34.252]  And we're talking three counties deep into the heart of Arizona where the answer from our government is to put up signs warning our citizens and our sovereign nation that beware.
[01:25:35.626 --> 01:25:36.466]  We're back live.
[01:25:36.466 --> 01:25:38.187]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls.
[01:25:38.187 --> 01:25:40.528]  Let's go to Mark in Oregon.
[01:25:40.528 --> 01:25:43.689]  Mark, and then Carl, Noel, Tony, Santa, and others.
[01:25:43.689 --> 01:25:44.889]  Welcome.
[01:25:44.889 --> 01:25:45.509]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:25:45.509 --> 01:25:46.309]  Hello.
[01:25:46.309 --> 01:25:47.430]  Hi.
[01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:48.310]  Yeah.
[01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:54.092]  Looks like we might have a short way to go and where we're going to doesn't look good at all, Alex.
[01:25:55.646 --> 01:25:57.027]  No, it's order out of chaos.
[01:25:57.027 --> 01:26:00.048]  The globalists admit they're holding America hostage.
[01:26:00.048 --> 01:26:01.688]  They're engineering all the crises.
[01:26:01.688 --> 01:26:03.769]  They blew that oil well in the Gulf.
[01:26:03.769 --> 01:26:08.551]  Obama brags to senators he's holding us hostage with the rampant crime.
[01:26:08.551 --> 01:26:10.852]  He is guilty of the murders on the border.
[01:26:10.852 --> 01:26:17.854]  And every traitor that is keeping that border open is guilty of premeditated accessory to murder.
[01:26:17.854 --> 01:26:21.496]  Obama is a public criminal.
[01:26:21.496 --> 01:26:22.556]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:50.428]  Alex, Officer Jack McClam on his show, soon after the explosion in the Gulf, he said unequivocally from the sources that he gets his information from in government and the intelligence community, he said that the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, who has no business out on the ocean in the first place, in all probability it was
[01:26:51.728 --> 01:26:55.231]  It was a group posing as the BLM.
[01:26:55.231 --> 01:27:00.695]  Well that may be why Obama said he dispatched SWAT teams to cover up the investigation that the Coast Guard was doing.
[01:27:00.695 --> 01:27:07.660]  And the word is, special federal feds showed up with national security badges ordering the Coast Guard to not investigate.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.322]  But you know what?
[01:27:09.322 --> 01:27:11.383]  McClam has impeccable research.
[01:27:11.383 --> 01:27:14.486]  If he says something that he has a source, he doesn't make it up.
[01:27:14.486 --> 01:27:16.127]  25 years on the front lines.
[01:27:16.127 --> 01:27:17.328]  Call Jack McClam right now.
[01:27:17.628 --> 01:27:17.968]  Yes, Alex.
[01:27:17.968 --> 01:27:21.469]  Jack McClam said that he learned at that time, soon after the explosion, that
[01:27:37.867 --> 01:27:47.513]  That particular oil rig, it was not any other oil rig but that one, just like Obama gave an actual award of some type to that particular oil rig.
[01:27:47.513 --> 01:27:52.876]  No, he won a year and he gave it to them, and BP are the kingpins of the carbon tax.
[01:27:52.876 --> 01:28:03.443]  And that the BLM came out on the water, in uniform of course, not being BLM at all, great probability, but posing as a BLM, where they have no business.
[01:28:04.062 --> 01:28:08.666]  And they came all the way out there and did a surprise inspection two hours before the explosion.
[01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:14.812]  Wait a minute, that's admitted that there was a surprise inspection that was, quote, unauthorized, unlawful.
[01:28:14.812 --> 01:28:16.634]  It wasn't unlawful.
[01:28:16.634 --> 01:28:23.320]  The word the media and the feds have used was unpermitted, but it was more than unpermitted.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.220]  They said that as well.
[01:28:26.102 --> 01:28:28.484]  It violated regulations.
[01:28:28.484 --> 01:28:34.689]  But they won't ever say what the change is, and oh bummer, Mr. Barry Sitaro's been covering that up.
[01:28:34.689 --> 01:28:49.301]  Yes, and Jack McClam said that in connection with this visit, Alex, that he was told that the BLM, whatever they were doing this inspection, actually had left an explosive device on the rig.
[01:28:49.301 --> 01:28:51.743]  Now if you think of it in terms of engineering,
[01:28:52.321 --> 01:29:10.147]  You could have an explosion to actually be the secondary to the primary, such as in a nuclear explosion type of... Well, no, I mean, it was the explosion to ignite the gas and the oil that was starting to come in, and then that makes the rig break and fall down on itself and then break at the wellhead.
[01:29:10.147 --> 01:29:11.288]  Yes, sir.
[01:29:11.288 --> 01:29:17.670]  And I thought that this was very important information because it just adds in the whole
[01:29:18.427 --> 01:29:19.348]  Pre-meditation
[01:29:36.331 --> 01:29:39.912]  That it's really true and we really need to look into it deeply whenever we hear about it.
[01:29:39.912 --> 01:29:40.853]  No, that's a great idea.
[01:29:40.853 --> 01:29:43.274]  We're going to call Jack right now and get him lined up today or tomorrow.
[01:29:43.274 --> 01:29:45.174]  We're going to get him on here.
[01:29:45.174 --> 01:29:47.035]  Great points.
[01:29:47.035 --> 01:29:48.155]  Thanks for telling me about that.
[01:29:48.155 --> 01:29:50.796]  Thanks for telling me about the dam the illegals wanted to blow up.
[01:29:50.796 --> 01:29:52.177]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.177 --> 01:29:54.698]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.698 --> 01:29:57.379]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:56.688 --> 01:30:57.449]  Check them out today.
[01:31:00.475 --> 01:31:03.479]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.479 --> 01:31:08.806]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:08.806 --> 01:31:10.869]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:10.869 --> 01:31:15.875]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:15.875 --> 01:31:17.057]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.057 --> 01:31:17.778]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.158 --> 01:31:20.040]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.121]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.121 --> 01:31:23.322]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.322 --> 01:31:24.664]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:24.664 --> 01:31:26.185]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.185 --> 01:31:31.449]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.449 --> 01:31:34.592]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.032 --> 01:31:38.853]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:38.853 --> 01:31:40.074]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.074 --> 01:31:40.974]  We don't know.
[01:31:40.974 --> 01:31:42.094]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.094 --> 01:31:43.014]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.014 --> 01:31:44.115]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.115 --> 01:31:47.156]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.156 --> 01:31:48.936]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:49.856]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:59.414 --> 01:32:03.957]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:03.957 --> 01:32:04.877]  Number 1.
[01:32:04.877 --> 01:32:08.300]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.160]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:14.063]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.063 --> 01:32:14.804]  It's true.
[01:32:14.804 --> 01:32:19.667]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:20.507]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.507 --> 01:32:24.090]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:27.792]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:27.992 --> 01:32:28.792]  Number 4.
[01:32:28.792 --> 01:32:31.533]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.533 --> 01:32:35.234]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.234 --> 01:32:36.015]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.015 --> 01:32:40.156]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.156 --> 01:32:45.218]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.218 --> 01:32:49.379]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.379 --> 01:32:51.179]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.179 --> 01:32:55.781]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:56.481 --> 01:33:07.384]  We're going to go back to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:33:07.384 --> 01:33:11.545]  But I want to encourage you, the listeners, to really think about something.
[01:33:11.545 --> 01:33:13.406]  To make a decision.
[01:33:13.406 --> 01:33:15.566]  Are you doing everything you can
[01:33:26.394 --> 01:33:32.278]  To wake up as many men, women, and children in your area as is possible.
[01:33:32.278 --> 01:33:37.182]  Are you reaching out to opinion makers right now?
[01:33:37.182 --> 01:33:50.211]  So many high-powered politicians, media personalities, judges, sports icons, I have been contacted.
[01:33:50.211 --> 01:33:53.033]  I'd say nine times out of 10 when famous people contact me.
[01:33:55.839 --> 01:34:00.381]  They don't want to come on air.
[01:34:00.381 --> 01:34:04.442]  They just want to talk to me and invite me out to their house in D.C.
[01:34:04.442 --> 01:34:05.263]  or L.A.
[01:34:05.263 --> 01:34:09.764]  or Santa Barbara or wherever or Florida.
[01:34:09.764 --> 01:34:11.405]  I don't have time for that.
[01:34:11.405 --> 01:34:16.687]  I don't have time to or the money to jet set around and hang around with famous people.
[01:34:16.687 --> 01:34:18.748]  I haven't gone that route.
[01:34:18.748 --> 01:34:21.529]  The point is that's a gauge of how many people we're reaching.
[01:34:25.017 --> 01:34:28.618]  Drudge is rated 400 and something on Alexa.com.
[01:34:28.618 --> 01:34:33.060]  Infowars is now rated 700 and change.
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.921]  I forget the exact rating.
[01:34:34.921 --> 01:34:42.883]  And if you look at our growth trend, within a year we'll be neck and neck with Drudge.
[01:34:42.883 --> 01:34:49.306]  We haven't really been good at putting on airs or being aloof or explaining to people just how big we are.
[01:34:50.342 --> 01:34:52.804]  Just how effective we are.
[01:34:52.804 --> 01:34:56.007]  I haven't really admitted to myself the reach we've got.
[01:34:56.007 --> 01:34:59.249]  And I'm not bragging about myself individually.
[01:34:59.249 --> 01:35:01.411]  It's a dangerous position to be in.
[01:35:01.411 --> 01:35:05.154]  The government, the mainstream media, and the NSA have known how big we are before I knew.
[01:35:05.154 --> 01:35:08.337]  They've got all the data points.
[01:35:10.097 --> 01:35:11.857]  And now they've tried to ignore me all this time.
[01:35:11.857 --> 01:35:15.038]  Now they've got to attack, which is a desperate gamble.
[01:35:15.038 --> 01:35:16.579]  So I'm in a real danger zone here.
[01:35:16.579 --> 01:35:18.179]  I need your prayers.
[01:35:18.179 --> 01:35:23.060]  And I'm trying to be focused and realize the position I'm in and do the best job I can.
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.721]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[01:35:24.721 --> 01:35:26.841]  Doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.
[01:35:26.841 --> 01:35:27.961]  But at least I'm pure of heart.
[01:35:27.961 --> 01:35:29.402]  I'm trying to be good.
[01:35:29.402 --> 01:35:30.702]  I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[01:35:30.702 --> 01:35:31.722]  I'm trying to get it right.
[01:35:31.722 --> 01:35:33.443]  I'm trying to be honorable.
[01:35:33.443 --> 01:35:36.724]  I'm trying to not be worldly.
[01:35:36.724 --> 01:35:38.224]  I'm trying to work as hard as I can.
[01:35:40.677 --> 01:35:47.102]  I feel guilty when I enjoy food, or go for a swim, or go see a movie, which I don't even really do.
[01:35:47.102 --> 01:35:49.043]  All I do is think about this, folks.
[01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:51.405]  I'm totally committed to it.
[01:35:51.405 --> 01:35:54.488]  I'm driven almost nuts by it.
[01:35:54.488 --> 01:35:56.709]  I want to not think about it, and I can't stop.
[01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:58.211]  I dream about the New World Order.
[01:35:58.211 --> 01:35:59.952]  I dream about legislation.
[01:35:59.952 --> 01:36:01.553]  I dream about executive orders.
[01:36:01.553 --> 01:36:04.255]  I dream about the enemy's next operations.
[01:36:04.255 --> 01:36:08.238]  I eat, sleep.
[01:36:08.238 --> 01:36:09.719]  You know what?
[01:36:09.719 --> 01:36:10.220]  All of this.
[01:36:14.468 --> 01:36:21.912]  And I know a lot of you, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, gave people a book, gave people a video, gave people a newsletter, but now you think you've done your work.
[01:36:21.912 --> 01:36:22.512]  No.
[01:36:22.512 --> 01:36:23.813]  Now is the time.
[01:36:23.813 --> 01:36:29.676]  I can't tell you how many people I talk to who say, I thought you were a kook!
[01:36:29.676 --> 01:36:34.679]  I thought you were a nut five years ago, a year ago, 10 years ago, it varies.
[01:36:34.679 --> 01:36:40.022]  Now it's all true and worse than you say, and they start, you know, just dumping all this info on me.
[01:36:40.022 --> 01:36:40.823]  Did you know about this?
[01:36:40.823 --> 01:36:41.523]  You know about that?
[01:36:41.523 --> 01:36:43.044]  No, I didn't know about that, but I knew about that.
[01:36:44.878 --> 01:36:54.121]  People are really seeing it, folks, but there's still, I'd say we've got about 35% of the public, or conservatively, that really knows something's wrong.
[01:36:54.121 --> 01:36:56.341]  10% really understands the ballgame.
[01:36:56.341 --> 01:36:58.082]  30% or so know something's wrong.
[01:36:58.082 --> 01:36:59.882]  Another 30, 40% are starting to wake up.
[01:36:59.882 --> 01:37:05.784]  We've got to wake them up now before they start World War III as a political diversion to keep the globalists in power.
[01:37:06.906 --> 01:37:10.227]  Before they stage another false flag, there's no doubt this oil spill is a false flag.
[01:37:10.227 --> 01:37:18.030]  You got a US Senator that met with Obama and he admitted they're keeping the border open and keeping the crime high to force through immigration reform.
[01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:20.711]  I mean, this is what they do!
[01:37:20.711 --> 01:37:22.432]  This is their modus operandi!
[01:37:22.432 --> 01:37:24.193]  I know these people!
[01:37:24.193 --> 01:37:29.455]  It's so frustrating to watch these crooks get away with this!
[01:37:29.455 --> 01:37:32.156]  America is at the crossroads right now and
[01:37:33.407 --> 01:37:36.329]  People are ready to be awakened now.
[01:37:36.329 --> 01:37:42.234]  If you've got a copy of Road to Tyranny, Endgame, Terror Storm, Obama Deception, Invisible Empire, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA...
[01:37:43.536 --> 01:37:46.598]  Any of my films, or the films we carry, make copies of it.
[01:37:46.598 --> 01:37:48.680]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.923]  Films are the best way to really present this info.
[01:37:52.923 --> 01:38:04.031]  And the best films of them all out there, give people the wide spectrum breakdown for a general understanding that's put together in a very entertaining, viewable, watchable way, is Invisible Empire, a new allure to find.
[01:38:04.031 --> 01:38:06.673]  Just out for two and a half months on DVD.
[01:38:06.673 --> 01:38:09.595]  So important at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:09.595 --> 01:38:11.617]  Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic,
[01:38:14.716 --> 01:38:20.621]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:38:20.621 --> 01:38:25.485]  And yes, your purchase makes this show possible, so I want to ask everybody to go to InfoWars.com today.
[01:38:27.478 --> 01:38:36.421]  And to order the books, the t-shirts, the materials, we've got four new, no, five new t-shirts up on both the Yahoo cart and the InfoWars cart.
[01:38:36.421 --> 01:38:43.264]  So you just go to InfoWars.com, you click on the top link that says Shopping Cart, and there's two different choices there.
[01:38:43.264 --> 01:38:47.245]  There's also the phone number and mailing address for you if you'd rather get them that way.
[01:38:47.245 --> 01:38:48.866]  But you can check out the great new t-shirts.
[01:38:48.866 --> 01:38:53.588]  We've got one that says Legalize Freedom and shows the American flag with the stripes being barbed wire.
[01:38:54.648 --> 01:38:56.550]  People will ask, what does that mean?
[01:38:56.550 --> 01:39:03.615]  And then you can have a, see if you get somebody to talk to you, then you're able to really go to the next level.
[01:39:03.615 --> 01:39:11.182]  And every person you reach, every person is a mind, an intellect, and ultimately a soul.
[01:39:11.182 --> 01:39:20.289]  Because I've found you can show somebody the truth of the New World Order intellectually, they're going to find out this is spiritual.
[01:39:20.289 --> 01:39:22.251]  And I never set out to try to bring people
[01:39:23.683 --> 01:39:27.925]  To the truth concerning Christ, I have a secular show.
[01:39:27.925 --> 01:39:30.546]  I want to bring them to the truth of the geopolitical nature.
[01:39:30.546 --> 01:39:34.668]  But that is the end bounty and I'm very pleased by it.
[01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:35.869]  And I realize that.
[01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:38.470]  But I didn't consciously set out to be some preacher.
[01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:44.853]  People find out about the New World Order and find out they really are Satanist, they start realizing, man, this is real!
[01:39:44.853 --> 01:39:47.814]  That's why they have movies like the Sherlock Holmes that I just got done watching.
[01:39:47.814 --> 01:39:48.415]  It's very good.
[01:39:49.897 --> 01:39:54.038]  But the message is, yes, Satanists run things, but they're just kooks.
[01:39:54.038 --> 01:39:57.699]  And a master atheist controls them.
[01:39:57.699 --> 01:39:58.699]  Well, whatever!
[01:39:58.699 --> 01:40:03.400]  They believe in Satan and they're manifesting it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:08.741]  I set out to wake people up about the private fellow reserve and overtaxation and attacks on the Second Amendment.
[01:40:08.741 --> 01:40:11.742]  And I, like you, fell down the rabbit hole and learned a lot.
[01:40:13.271 --> 01:40:19.513]  But the issue is we also need your financial support and people are ready to be woken up right now like never before and please redouble your efforts.
[01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:20.613]  Air them on AXS TV.
[01:40:20.613 --> 01:40:21.213]  Make copies.
[01:40:21.213 --> 01:40:22.774]  Get them out to everyone.
[01:40:22.774 --> 01:40:23.514]  Get the t-shirts.

[01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:49.094]  Well good to be able to get on.
[01:40:49.094 --> 01:40:49.495]  Hey Alex, wasn't
[01:41:11.127 --> 01:41:18.359]  Part of the original purpose of militias for assisting law enforcement such as the sheriff.
[01:41:18.359 --> 01:41:18.960]  Yes.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.347]  Isn't there a militia in Arizona to back up the sheriff?
[01:41:24.432 --> 01:41:29.274]  No, the media a hundred years ago started calling them posses.
[01:41:29.274 --> 01:41:30.535]  They were really called militias.
[01:41:30.535 --> 01:41:35.617]  I've gone back to the old newspaper articles in the 1840s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[01:41:35.617 --> 01:41:39.759]  And that's how the sheriff under the militia power could say, you, you, and you come with me.
[01:41:39.759 --> 01:41:45.202]  And normally he'd find guys that were former military or that they trusted and that they would deputize.
[01:41:46.182 --> 01:41:54.566]  It was just really civil defense, but see the government and the corporate structure doesn't want citizens to know they're part of the system or that the people are the government.
[01:41:54.566 --> 01:41:56.967]  You know, the message that we can be armed.
[01:41:56.967 --> 01:42:07.573]  And so even the sheriffs begging for federal help are kind of saying, I noticed this one sheriff isn't demonizing these militias running around with M-16s in the scrub brush.
[01:42:07.573 --> 01:42:11.555]  They're just saying, hey this is dangerous, thanks for the help, but this is only going to escalate it.
[01:42:13.075 --> 01:42:17.136]  And Mexico's full of desperate people that the drug cartels and the government can hire.
[01:42:17.136 --> 01:42:22.378]  And so they're gonna fight, and they're not wimps.
[01:42:22.378 --> 01:42:30.341]  But maybe coming to a head is what has to happen for people to finally face what's going on.
[01:42:30.341 --> 01:42:37.543]  But no, I mean, those sheriffs, I guarantee you, they showed up and went on the local radio and said, all right, we're gonna have training next week.
[01:42:38.603 --> 01:42:40.145]  And I need people to come in.
[01:42:40.145 --> 01:42:51.153]  We'll do background checks, make sure they're not felons, make sure they're upstanding in the community, and that they've got some type of firearm training, and particularly military veterans.
[01:42:51.153 --> 01:42:59.760]  And if you called out Americans, you'd have, in the smallest towns, half the men show up and go down there and let the Mexican government and the troops open fire.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.381]  This time our people won't run.
[01:43:01.381 --> 01:43:06.986]  They will absolutely beat them over the border, and if Mexico wants to attack, we'll go back down to Mexico City.
[01:43:07.546 --> 01:43:09.608]  Like we've done before.
[01:43:09.608 --> 01:43:09.888]  Okay?
[01:43:09.888 --> 01:43:12.090]  I mean, if Mexico wants a war, it's time to have it.
[01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:13.451]  This is a real war.
[01:43:13.451 --> 01:43:16.994]  Wars are with countries that border you, that are attacking you.
[01:43:16.994 --> 01:43:19.376]  They're not with people 8,000 miles away.
[01:43:19.376 --> 01:43:21.077]  Let me tell you something.
[01:43:21.077 --> 01:43:24.260]  If Mexico starts a war with us, I'm going to go enlist right now.
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.341]  I want to go.
[01:43:25.341 --> 01:43:27.042]  I'll go down there right now.
[01:43:27.042 --> 01:43:29.064]  That's what war is all about.
[01:43:29.064 --> 01:43:30.245]  Defending the Republic.
[01:43:30.245 --> 01:43:32.847]  It's not about killing a bunch of poor Arabs.
[01:43:32.847 --> 01:43:33.568]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:42.774]  So, anyway, if I were a sheriff, I'd be trying to assemble a posse right now.
[01:43:42.774 --> 01:43:54.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's okay for SWAT teams to kill dogs and shoot kids in the back of the wrong house and they always defend themselves, but God forbid a few eggs get broken with a paramilitary force attacking our country 80 to 100 miles in.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.003]  God forbid we send the military down there to light these people up that are firing at them.
[01:44:01.457 --> 01:44:04.868]  Only thing is our current military is illegitimate right now.
[01:44:07.006 --> 01:44:08.067]  You're right, you're right.
[01:44:08.067 --> 01:44:08.847]  I mean, it is.
[01:44:08.847 --> 01:44:10.248]  It's a totally new world order run.
[01:44:10.248 --> 01:44:13.610]  I mean, look, Obama, and this was Bush too.
[01:44:13.610 --> 01:44:29.101]  Look, it was in the Dallas Morning News that Rob Allen & Co., the big PR firm that Karl Rove hired to run Bush's gubernatorial runs in Texas, twice, and his presidential run, were the ones that told him, wear white t-shirts, have American flags, and go out and protest.
[01:44:29.101 --> 01:44:33.864]  And then the media... Bush, the White House, ran that with Calderon.
[01:44:35.006 --> 01:44:35.647]  Okay.
[01:44:35.647 --> 01:44:37.649]  And before that with Vicente Fox.
[01:44:37.649 --> 01:44:38.690]  I mean, that is on record.
[01:44:38.690 --> 01:44:40.271]  It's all treason, sir.
[01:44:40.271 --> 01:44:41.733]  And Obama is continuing it.
[01:44:41.733 --> 01:44:47.738]  It is just... Think about how citizens get pulled over and our blood gets taken at warrantless checkpoints.
[01:44:48.604 --> 01:44:49.485]  And nobody complains.
[01:44:49.485 --> 01:44:50.966]  The ACLU doesn't complain.
[01:44:50.966 --> 01:45:02.695]  But then, the bill, which I've read on air, the subsection says if they pull over a group of people, and there's alcohol, or they're speeding, and they ask for ID, and they don't have it, and they're illegal aliens, they are to arrest them.
[01:45:02.695 --> 01:45:04.117]  That is in the bill.
[01:45:04.117 --> 01:45:06.599]  It isn't run around and arrest brown people.
[01:45:06.599 --> 01:45:09.181]  That's another hoax.
[01:45:09.181 --> 01:45:10.282]  It's all a hoax.
[01:45:10.282 --> 01:45:15.466]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:15.466 --> 01:45:16.066]  It's insane.
[01:45:16.066 --> 01:45:17.688]  Alright, I'm gonna go to
[01:45:19.963 --> 01:45:29.286]  Tony and Senna, or Santa, however you pronounce it, Helen, Gabriel, others.
[01:45:29.286 --> 01:45:33.588]  But, I mean, do you think I like getting up here and going against the political correctness?
[01:45:33.588 --> 01:45:40.090]  Knowing there's tens of millions of dumbed-down Americans that think if you so much as want
[01:45:41.454 --> 01:45:44.016]  Have a medical test on somebody coming in with leprosy.
[01:45:44.016 --> 01:45:45.497]  Oh yeah, that's come out in the news.
[01:45:45.497 --> 01:45:48.619]  There were no cases of leprosy in 2000 in Texas.
[01:45:48.619 --> 01:45:52.802]  And by 2005, there were 7,000 cases in Texas.
[01:45:52.802 --> 01:45:55.764]  That was in the news.
[01:45:55.764 --> 01:45:57.985]  And I'm evil and I'm racist and I'm bad.
[01:45:57.985 --> 01:45:59.526]  And then people bowed down to that.
[01:45:59.526 --> 01:46:03.569]  And then, oh, now, if you're against government healthcare, you're a racist.
[01:46:03.569 --> 01:46:04.129]  Well, you know what?
[01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:06.190]  I'm done.
[01:46:06.190 --> 01:46:06.691]  I'm done.
[01:46:08.775 --> 01:46:10.635]  With being bullied by that.
[01:46:10.635 --> 01:46:11.496]  That's not what it's about.
[01:46:11.496 --> 01:46:14.216]  It's about survival and everybody knows it.
[01:46:14.216 --> 01:46:15.236]  Everybody knows it.
[01:46:15.236 --> 01:46:17.957]  I mean, look at Obama's labor chief.
[01:46:17.957 --> 01:46:19.937]  Says illegals have right to fair wages.
[01:46:19.937 --> 01:46:20.577]  What?
[01:46:20.577 --> 01:46:21.497]  What?
[01:46:21.497 --> 01:46:21.678]  What?
[01:46:21.678 --> 01:46:24.318]  They're illegal.
[01:46:24.318 --> 01:46:26.278]  Kick them out.
[01:46:26.278 --> 01:46:29.579]  Arrest their employers.
[01:46:29.579 --> 01:46:30.299]  Don't.
[01:46:30.299 --> 01:46:31.519]  Don't, don't, don't.
[01:46:31.519 --> 01:46:33.960]  See, I mean, use them as a political force.
[01:46:35.836 --> 01:46:37.216]  All selectively enforced.
[01:46:37.216 --> 01:46:38.017]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[01:46:38.017 --> 01:46:40.497]  When we come back from break, I'm going to go to your phone calls quicker.
[01:46:40.497 --> 01:46:43.678]  I'm going to try to.
[01:46:43.678 --> 01:46:45.758]  And I've got all the news about the attack on Iran.
[01:46:45.758 --> 01:46:50.479]  It gets worse by the minute.
[01:46:50.479 --> 01:46:51.319]  This is it, folks.
[01:46:51.319 --> 01:47:02.322]  This is the world government takeover, and they're going to use a war in the middle of this financial and military and open border takeover as a political distraction so the average American stops looking around them and salutes the flag as the ship goes down.
[01:47:04.685 --> 01:47:05.026]  We're good.
[01:47:21.144 --> 01:47:30.287]  Financial Times of London and London Guardian, record amounts, billions and billions of pounds of gold in British sterling being bought by the Rothschilds.
[01:47:30.287 --> 01:47:39.631]  The Saudi Arabian royalty, the House of Saud, the Foreign News is reporting, doubled its holdings of gold overnight.
[01:47:39.631 --> 01:47:47.714]  So the elites are now rushing into gold and I don't, maybe that's because they can hoard it and then
[01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:52.654]  Dump them on the market and try to manipulate or maybe they've decided to go ahead and let gold go up.
[01:47:52.654 --> 01:47:55.497]  I mean clearly, well Ted Anderson, a lot's going on.
[01:47:55.497 --> 01:47:57.940]  What do you think about all these elites rushing into gold?
[01:47:58.806 --> 01:48:00.708]  Well, it's certainly the trend right now.
[01:48:00.708 --> 01:48:01.989]  The elite is getting into gold.
[01:48:01.989 --> 01:48:07.734]  I mean, everybody knows that the United States dollar is under attack, and the elite people are the ones that are attacking it.
[01:48:07.734 --> 01:48:14.300]  So, I mean, the Federal Reserve System is trying to figure out how to put more deposits into the bank so we don't have bank runs.
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:16.623]  You know, before when we had a... Oh yeah, I forgot.
[01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:18.364]  In fact, guys, I didn't see it in my stack.
[01:48:18.364 --> 01:48:19.365]  I forgot to IM it.
[01:48:19.365 --> 01:48:20.346]  Sorry to interrupt, Ted.
[01:48:20.346 --> 01:48:21.347]  Will you guys print...
[01:48:22.708 --> 01:48:24.010]  Bank runs in Spain.
[01:48:24.010 --> 01:48:24.971]  It's mainstream news.
[01:48:24.971 --> 01:48:25.372]  I forgot.
[01:48:25.372 --> 01:48:27.294]  Oh yeah, there's bank runs in Spain, Ted.
[01:48:27.294 --> 01:48:27.735]  I know it.
[01:48:27.735 --> 01:48:28.115]  I know it.
[01:48:28.115 --> 01:48:29.477]  And that's the whole thing.
[01:48:29.477 --> 01:48:33.903]  I mean, if it wasn't for the printing press, there'd be bank runs right here in the United States.
[01:48:33.903 --> 01:48:36.527]  I guess that's why they put the Federal Reserve System into place.
[01:48:37.045 --> 01:48:40.827]  You know, so to speak, to stop that kind of a thing from happening.
[01:48:40.827 --> 01:48:43.468]  So they can quietly bleed us out through inflation.
[01:48:43.468 --> 01:48:44.048]  Exactly.
[01:48:44.048 --> 01:48:45.909]  That's the offset to that.
[01:48:45.909 --> 01:48:54.313]  That's why everybody who has half a brain is getting out of the paper dollars and the conventional type investments and they're getting into gold and silver.
[01:48:54.313 --> 01:48:57.615]  And quite frankly, they should.
[01:48:57.615 --> 01:48:59.536]  I mean, honestly, I mean, think about it.
[01:48:59.536 --> 01:49:01.197]  I mean, what are you doing?
[01:49:01.197 --> 01:49:05.639]  By putting your money in the bank, you're financing this oligarchy of
[01:49:06.129 --> 01:49:07.911]  You know, I mean, elite people.
[01:49:07.911 --> 01:49:10.215]  It just, it drives me crazy, Alex.
[01:49:10.215 --> 01:49:20.608]  I mean, especially, I mean, I listen to your show and just look at the news and the information that I see and you know that we're just handing over our wealth over to this institution and then they...
[01:49:21.049 --> 01:49:22.470]  Everything is intensifying, Ted.
[01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:24.813]  It's like you just reminded me of the Spanish bank runs.
[01:49:24.813 --> 01:49:31.059]  People remind me of the plot to blow up a dam that would kill at least 10,000 people with major towns below it.
[01:49:31.059 --> 01:49:33.020]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:35.343]  I can't even keep track of it anymore, Ted.
[01:49:35.343 --> 01:49:36.744]  It's all happening.
[01:49:36.744 --> 01:49:38.546]  They're moving at once.
[01:49:38.546 --> 01:49:41.649]  I know, and it's insane, like you said.
[01:49:42.069 --> 01:49:44.751]  Now, Alex, I'm holding that Frank coin down.
[01:49:44.751 --> 01:49:48.594]  Same price that I had before gold ran up over $1,260.
[01:49:48.594 --> 01:49:49.915]  Right now gold is up over $7.
[01:49:49.915 --> 01:49:52.277]  It's seen as high as $1,243 today.
[01:49:52.277 --> 01:49:58.642]  The market took a little bit of a correction and, you know, that's what it does.
[01:49:58.642 --> 01:50:01.064]  When it has a run-up, there's a little bit of a back-off.
[01:50:01.064 --> 01:50:08.290]  A lot of the times that's manipulation from the Open Market Committee or also the Plunge Protection Team trying to shore up the U.S.
[01:50:08.290 --> 01:50:08.430]  dollar.
[01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:09.971]  You've still got an insane deal on the Frank.
[01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:10.872]  You still have Buffaloes.
[01:50:11.252 --> 01:50:12.474]  Yep, still have Buffalos.
[01:50:12.474 --> 01:50:13.576]  Still have American Eagles.
[01:50:13.576 --> 01:50:15.919]  Still got those great deals on silver half dollars.
[01:50:15.919 --> 01:50:22.690]  Yep, the silver half dollars at $9.75 with silver jumping over $19 an ounce is such a steal it's not even funny.
[01:50:23.246 --> 01:50:26.588]  So if you're looking for something in silver, that would be a great way to get involved.
[01:50:44.176 --> 01:50:47.198]  Instead, here they're just devaluing the currency and mass printing.
[01:50:47.198 --> 01:50:49.760]  Now there's evidence they're starting to slow down on that.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:51.881]  Protect yourself in gold and silver today.
[01:50:51.881 --> 01:50:51.941]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:51.941 --> 01:50:54.543]  Ted, finish up with the offer on the other side.
[01:51:01.041 --> 01:51:02.342]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.342 --> 01:51:07.927]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:12.951]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.951 --> 01:51:13.431]  It's true.
[01:51:13.431 --> 01:51:17.975]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.519 --> 01:51:23.740]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:26.041]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.041 --> 01:51:30.842]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.842 --> 01:51:31.962]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.962 --> 01:51:35.043]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.

[01:53:02.048 --> 01:53:02.808]  The problem.
[01:53:02.808 --> 01:53:05.389]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:53:05.389 --> 01:53:08.110]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:53:08.110 --> 01:53:10.771]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:53:10.771 --> 01:53:13.272]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:53:13.272 --> 01:53:22.274]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[01:53:22.274 --> 01:53:24.055]  KaroStove has been in business for over 12

[01:53:51.526 --> 01:53:56.932]  Again, call 888-395-1164 or go to kerostove.com.
[01:53:56.932 --> 01:54:00.036]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[01:54:19.591 --> 01:54:28.098]  Well, a judge has vetoed Obama, so that'll cause a constitutional fight or crisis, saying there's no six-month moratorium on oil drilling.
[01:54:28.098 --> 01:54:32.963]  And the way they define deep drilling is really shallow drilling.
[01:54:32.963 --> 01:54:37.206]  You want to see your oil go up to seven, eight dollars a gallon at the gas pump?
[01:54:37.206 --> 01:54:38.968]  You want to see your gasoline cost that?
[01:54:40.788 --> 01:54:42.009]  It's asinine, folks.
[01:54:42.009 --> 01:54:43.370]  We are based on oil.
[01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:48.153]  Yes, it's got some problems, but the globalists claim they're trying to bring in new clean energies.
[01:54:48.153 --> 01:54:50.335]  In every case I do research, they're blocking it.
[01:54:50.335 --> 01:54:55.038]  The World Bank, the IMF, the federal government has bought up thousands of inventions.
[01:54:55.038 --> 01:54:58.620]  I saw one just two weeks ago that Rob Jacobson brought me.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:04.284]  He first saw an article in The Economist, then he went and searched it and found the actual World Bank document.
[01:55:04.284 --> 01:55:05.124]  He gave it to me.
[01:55:05.124 --> 01:55:06.646]  I never got to it, but I read the article.
[01:55:07.626 --> 01:55:18.677]  And you can go pull this stuff up for this solar generator that's just these big metal cylinders that grab heat from the sun and then go into a system and they're super cheap.
[01:55:18.677 --> 01:55:25.403]  They create masses of power and MIT developed it and then the World Bank came and bought it.
[01:55:25.403 --> 01:55:26.805]  And now again, the World Bank is our money.
[01:55:28.186 --> 01:55:32.628]  But you notice it's always in key operations, swindling people, and won't let it be deployed for the public.
[01:55:32.628 --> 01:55:39.151]  I mean, they just literally have warehouses of inventions and systems that are kept from the world.
[01:55:39.151 --> 01:55:43.732]  It's like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, where they take the Ark into that giant, endless warehouse.
[01:55:43.732 --> 01:55:46.133]  Now, that's a good allegory for it.
[01:55:46.133 --> 01:55:50.155]  They're not... Look, I... It'd be great to get off oil, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:50.155 --> 01:55:50.795]  It is dirty.
[01:55:50.795 --> 01:55:51.936]  It does have problems.
[01:55:51.936 --> 01:55:53.677]  But we're based on it!
[01:55:53.677 --> 01:55:56.598]  And all they're gonna do is give you carbon taxes and rip you off!
[01:55:57.418 --> 01:55:59.659]  And let other countries drill out there!
[01:55:59.659 --> 01:56:01.779]  It's only America that can't drill!
[01:56:01.779 --> 01:56:11.402]  It's Obama tying our hands because of that multinational company, BP, that's literally bankrolled him and Al Gore behind all the global governance funding, the carbon taxes.
[01:56:11.402 --> 01:56:13.003]  It's always BP!
[01:56:13.003 --> 01:56:18.364]  By the way, did you guys find that clip I was telling you about, where the BP vice president for global governance is talking about global government?
[01:56:18.364 --> 01:56:19.825]  And it's on the screen, it says global government?
[01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:23.351]  I know we reposted it to the Facebook account.
[01:56:23.351 --> 01:56:23.751]  You know what?
[01:56:23.751 --> 01:56:24.351]  Call Watson.
[01:56:24.351 --> 01:56:25.272]  Get me Watson on the line.
[01:56:25.272 --> 01:56:36.916]  I just want him to write an article with all the BP TV ads calling for world government and carbon tax and pointing out that they're the biggest greenie wieners in the universe and that they stage this!
[01:56:36.916 --> 01:56:37.496]  Here's another one.
[01:56:37.496 --> 01:56:40.517]  Louisiana police pull over activists at behest of BP.
[01:56:40.517 --> 01:56:41.857]  This is treason!
[01:56:41.857 --> 01:56:43.838]  This is Mother Jones confirmed.
[01:56:43.838 --> 01:56:48.840]  Now BP is such a god that they have the police harassing citizens for them.
[01:56:49.588 --> 01:56:53.170]  Because they've got full Obama mafia backing.
[01:56:53.170 --> 01:56:54.491]  Ted, I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[01:56:54.491 --> 01:56:57.852]  It's just... It's really hard for me.
[01:56:57.852 --> 01:56:59.113]  I may have to go to Louisiana.
[01:56:59.113 --> 01:57:02.375]  I mean, I'm not going to have some BP thug let them arrest me.
[01:57:02.375 --> 01:57:03.355]  I'm sick of the cops.
[01:57:03.355 --> 01:57:05.016]  I'm sick of the mafia.
[01:57:05.016 --> 01:57:13.821]  When the police follow the orders of BP mafia and pull citizens over to be interrogated by BP because they dare videotape them, that's treason.
[01:57:13.821 --> 01:57:14.942]  You're not a cop anymore.
[01:57:14.942 --> 01:57:16.042]  You're a thug.
[01:57:16.042 --> 01:57:17.083]  You're a criminal.
[01:57:17.083 --> 01:57:18.504]  I don't care if you got a 10 badge.
[01:57:19.551 --> 01:57:21.312]  That again, you're just a cowardly citizen.
[01:57:21.312 --> 01:57:29.457]  See, they like pulling you over and slapping you around, but some Mexican cartel that's actually got a gun, they run, you know, they run to the outhouse because they poop themselves.
[01:57:29.457 --> 01:57:37.782]  I'm sorry to get graphic here, but the police have to wear diapers in Arizona and South Texas, but not when they deal with a cowardly American.
[01:57:37.782 --> 01:57:39.763]  Ted Anderson, I'm sick of it.
[01:57:39.763 --> 01:57:44.146]  Ted, tell folks about the other coins you've got in the offer because it's so important for people to protect themselves.
[01:57:44.554 --> 01:57:52.862]  Well, again, Alex, I mean, the Frank at $265, and when you get that full year subscription to the Forecaster with it, I mean, that is so low, it's ridiculous.
[01:57:52.862 --> 01:57:56.606]  I mean, it's bringing gold back down below $500 an ounce.
[01:57:56.606 --> 01:57:59.689]  I mean, you're not going to buy it anywhere else for that kind of a price.
[01:58:00.249 --> 01:58:03.133]  Best place right here at Midas.
[01:58:03.133 --> 01:58:06.858]  Um, $20 Liberties are good at $1,547.
[01:58:06.858 --> 01:58:10.122]  That Eagle that you mentioned, what about Junk Silver?
[01:58:10.122 --> 01:58:16.309]  I mean, but quite literally, the Walking Liberty half at $975, when I regularly price them, they're closer to $11, so...
[01:58:18.031 --> 01:58:18.952]  I'd give us a call.
[01:58:18.952 --> 01:58:20.213]  I mean, right now is a good time.
[01:58:20.213 --> 01:58:21.975]  No, those are really insane deals.
[01:58:21.975 --> 01:58:24.196]  Folks, research the deals Ted's offering.
[01:58:24.196 --> 01:58:27.439]  Find out what a good deal they are for yourself, and then purchase.
[01:58:27.439 --> 01:58:29.021]  I buy it not as an investment, though.
[01:58:29.021 --> 01:58:31.423]  People are saying it's a great investment, obviously.
[01:58:31.423 --> 01:58:33.785]  I get it as a hedge against inflation and depression.
[01:58:33.785 --> 01:58:34.125]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:34.125 --> 01:58:34.485]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:58:34.485 --> 01:58:34.525]  800-686-2237.

[01:59:53.571 --> 01:59:55.933]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.933 --> 01:59:58.715]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.478 --> 02:00:10.323]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.323 --> 02:00:11.904]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.904 --> 02:00:13.466]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.466 --> 02:00:17.650]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:21.714]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:30.121]  Alright, we've now reached the halfway point in this Tuesday transmission.
[02:00:30.121 --> 02:00:34.944]  We're simulcasting the radio show in living color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:34.944 --> 02:00:37.006]  It is Tuesday, the 22nd day of June 2010.
[02:00:37.006 --> 02:00:40.909]  I'm taking your calls and covering news for the next 30 minutes.
[02:00:40.909 --> 02:00:43.311]  Then, a great researcher, author...
[02:00:44.331 --> 02:00:50.236]  Very astute historian because I've done a lot of research and I learn a lot from Alan Watt.
[02:00:50.236 --> 02:00:55.421]  But so much of the time when he's talking, I know the exact quotes, the history, what he's researched.
[02:00:55.421 --> 02:00:58.744]  He's just one of the most amazing brains we've talked to.
[02:00:58.744 --> 02:01:00.705]  That's coming up in 30 minutes.
[02:01:00.705 --> 02:01:02.487]  And I can just tell you, he's bonafide.
[02:01:03.147 --> 02:01:13.132]  His information is dead-on and very deep, very piercing, and so we'll always have thought-provoking banter back and forth and your phone calls when he joins us.
[02:01:13.132 --> 02:01:16.973]  If you just joined us yourself, this is out of the Associated Press.
[02:01:16.973 --> 02:01:20.035]  Judge blocks Gulf offshore drilling moratorium.
[02:01:20.035 --> 02:01:27.418]  A federal judge in New Orleans has blocked a six-month moratorium on new deep-water drilling projects that was imposed in response to the massive oil spill.
[02:01:27.938 --> 02:01:29.839]  This is a breaking news update.
[02:01:29.839 --> 02:01:41.163]  The man in charge of the $20 million fund to confiscate people whose livelihoods have been ruined by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has headed back Tuesday to talk to officials about the claims process.
[02:01:41.163 --> 02:01:44.605]  So that was just a little blurb there at the top of the AP in a separate article.
[02:01:46.170 --> 02:01:51.211]  Continuing, Louisiana police pull over activists at behest of BP.
[02:01:51.211 --> 02:01:53.172]  We'll tell you more about this.
[02:01:53.172 --> 02:01:56.592]  And Google facing criminal charges in the U.S.
[02:01:56.592 --> 02:02:03.954]  as now as many as 20 states line up with criminal indictments for their illegal NSA spying at the behest of the NSA.
[02:02:03.954 --> 02:02:05.734]  They are the NSA.
[02:02:05.734 --> 02:02:07.715]  And we've all told you that years ago.
[02:02:07.715 --> 02:02:10.635]  They're watching you off the cameras on your computer at home, folks.
[02:02:10.635 --> 02:02:11.696]  They even admit that.
[02:02:11.696 --> 02:02:12.616]  They hide in plain view.
[02:02:13.697 --> 02:02:15.437]  That's a psych warfare technique.
[02:02:15.437 --> 02:02:18.938]  State Attorney Generals are waking up and going, this is illegal.
[02:02:18.938 --> 02:02:22.539]  You've got vans driving around capturing everyone's digital traffic illegally?
[02:02:22.539 --> 02:02:24.880]  That's wiretapping.
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:25.360]  Side issue.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.280]  That's coming up.
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:27.340]  The Iran situation.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:29.041]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[02:02:29.041 --> 02:02:29.961]  Tony in Illinois.
[02:02:29.961 --> 02:02:30.761]  Tony, you're on the air.
[02:02:30.761 --> 02:02:33.122]  Hi, how you doing, Alex?
[02:02:33.122 --> 02:02:34.662]  I just got two comments for you.
[02:02:34.662 --> 02:02:38.483]  You know, if you go to Arizona, be very careful because the Mexican cartels,
[02:02:39.002 --> 02:02:40.942]  They're going to be on some crazy stuff.
[02:02:40.942 --> 02:02:45.343]  I live in Chicago and people are just killing each other over being able to sell a little bit of crack.
[02:02:45.343 --> 02:02:48.884]  Yeah, I read there were 50 plus murders over the weekend in Chicago.
[02:02:48.884 --> 02:02:52.704]  In fact, guys, Google 54 murders Chicago.
[02:02:52.704 --> 02:02:55.605]  I think it was murders or it may have been violent incidents.
[02:02:55.605 --> 02:02:56.405]  I saw that headline.
[02:02:56.405 --> 02:02:57.725]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:02:57.725 --> 02:03:07.667]  And my other comment is, I'm part of We Are Change Chicago and we're going to be at the Case Chicago the whole entire thing, handing out DVDs, pegging out flyers, telling people the truth, trying to wake up
[02:03:08.021 --> 02:03:11.107]  The American citizens what is happening in our world right now.
[02:03:11.107 --> 02:03:15.256]  So there's a lot of people that are asleep that don't know like the building I live in.
[02:03:15.256 --> 02:03:17.621]  I wear my Bears are tall shirt and I live around a bunch of yuppies.
[02:03:17.621 --> 02:03:18.583]  They just look at me, you know.
[02:03:23.917 --> 02:03:33.200]  Well, they're the type of people that would go watch LeBron James, you know, and 4,000 people for an appreciation event that he barely even showed up to.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:34.841]  That's what's valuable to them.
[02:03:34.841 --> 02:03:38.482]  So, as I said, move on, as you're doing, to people that do care.
[02:03:38.482 --> 02:03:46.105]  The yuppie-type folks or the trendies, they're never going to be a factor in history.
[02:03:46.105 --> 02:03:47.486]  They don't want to be a factor.
[02:03:47.486 --> 02:03:48.286]  What else is on your mind?
[02:03:49.266 --> 02:03:51.147]  Um, I pray for you every night, Alex.
[02:03:51.147 --> 02:03:57.649]  You, your family, your staff, for God to watch over you and take care of you and bless you as you're giving information that needs to be heard.
[02:03:57.649 --> 02:03:59.189]  The media doesn't say none of this stuff.
[02:03:59.189 --> 02:04:00.670]  They're scared, you know?
[02:04:00.670 --> 02:04:01.930]  They don't want to talk about it.
[02:04:01.930 --> 02:04:03.571]  Or they say it, but they spin it!
[02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:06.790]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:07.531]  That's true.
[02:04:07.531 --> 02:04:14.396]  You're right, a lot of times they lie, but I'm also... People say, well, why are you reading mainstream news if it's all bull?
[02:04:14.396 --> 02:04:16.738]  Well, here's an example.
[02:04:16.738 --> 02:04:20.121]  California license plates may go digital.
[02:04:20.121 --> 02:04:22.983]  Image ad blaring license plates.
[02:04:22.983 --> 02:04:24.464]  NBC News.
[02:04:24.464 --> 02:04:27.927]  Well, this is them telling you a Big Brother system is good.
[02:04:30.226 --> 02:04:34.433]  Uh, and I'm gonna take their propaganda and point out how it's bad.
[02:04:34.433 --> 02:04:43.226]  Before I read the article, and I saw this last night on InfoWars.com, a link to it, I immediately knew what it was gonna say before I read it.
[02:04:43.226 --> 02:04:44.988]  Not that I'm smart, I know the enemy.
[02:04:45.829 --> 02:04:52.233]  I knew it would later in the article say it was going to be government propaganda messages, not just ads.
[02:04:52.233 --> 02:05:00.998]  And sure enough, tattle on your neighbor, spy on your neighbor, kids tattle on your parents, your license plates will now be telescreens.
[02:05:00.998 --> 02:05:03.219]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:05:03.219 --> 02:05:05.680]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:08.882]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:05:08.882 --> 02:05:13.625]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:05:13.985 --> 02:05:18.488]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:05:18.488 --> 02:05:20.849]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:05:20.849 --> 02:05:23.391]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:05:23.391 --> 02:05:26.632]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:05:26.632 --> 02:05:34.237]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:05:34.577 --> 02:05:39.962]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:05:39.962 --> 02:05:42.284]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:05:42.284 --> 02:05:46.507]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:05:46.507 --> 02:05:47.588]  And I got news for you.
[02:05:47.588 --> 02:05:48.929]  You're everyone else.
[02:05:48.929 --> 02:05:50.431]  Invisible Empire.

[02:06:01.462 --> 02:06:04.486]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.486 --> 02:06:09.813]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.813 --> 02:06:11.856]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.856 --> 02:06:16.862]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.862 --> 02:06:18.044]  How much do you want?
[02:06:18.044 --> 02:06:18.785]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.145 --> 02:06:21.047]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:21.047 --> 02:06:22.108]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.108 --> 02:06:24.310]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:25.652]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.652 --> 02:06:27.193]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.193 --> 02:06:32.459]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.459 --> 02:06:35.582]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:36.022 --> 02:06:39.843]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.843 --> 02:06:41.063]  How much will you need?
[02:06:41.063 --> 02:06:41.984]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.984 --> 02:06:43.084]  How much do you want?
[02:06:43.084 --> 02:06:44.004]  All you can get.
[02:06:44.004 --> 02:06:45.104]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.104 --> 02:06:48.165]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.165 --> 02:06:49.925]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.925 --> 02:06:50.846]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.492 --> 02:07:05.476]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:05.476 --> 02:07:06.456]  What have we got?
[02:07:06.456 --> 02:07:08.918]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:08.918 --> 02:07:09.919]  A republic.
[02:07:09.919 --> 02:07:12.561]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:12.561 --> 02:07:14.843]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:14.843 --> 02:07:16.844]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:16.844 --> 02:07:18.545]  So they think they own our land?
[02:07:18.545 --> 02:07:19.846]  They think they own our water?
[02:07:19.846 --> 02:07:20.467]  Children?
[02:07:20.467 --> 02:07:21.588]  Our education?
[02:07:21.588 --> 02:07:22.428]  Our money?
[02:07:22.428 --> 02:07:26.071]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:26.431 --> 02:07:31.418]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:07:31.418 --> 02:07:32.439]  We have the facts.
[02:07:32.439 --> 02:07:33.581]  We have the Constitution.
[02:07:33.581 --> 02:07:34.502]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:07:34.502 --> 02:07:35.383]  We have common law.
[02:07:35.383 --> 02:07:37.907]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:37.907 --> 02:07:41.692]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:07:41.792 --> 02:07:46.733]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:07:46.733 --> 02:07:48.234]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:07:48.234 --> 02:07:49.334]  Don't tread on me.
[02:07:49.334 --> 02:08:01.217]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:08:01.217 --> 02:08:06.158]  This communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.158 --> 02:08:08.439]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.863 --> 02:08:23.492]  All right, my friends.
[02:08:23.492 --> 02:08:29.318]  We are continuing with your phone calls.
[02:08:29.318 --> 02:08:31.440]  Let's talk to Helen in Canada.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:32.381]  You're on the air, Helen.
[02:08:32.381 --> 02:08:33.262]  Welcome.
[02:08:33.262 --> 02:08:34.003]  Yes.
[02:08:34.003 --> 02:08:34.884]  Hi, Alex.
[02:08:34.884 --> 02:08:35.064]  Hi.
[02:08:35.717 --> 02:08:40.201]  There's definitely a war on for our minds and it's been going on for a long time.
[02:08:40.201 --> 02:08:51.672]  In Canada, in my province where I live, just last week when I attended our school board meeting where I'm allowed to speak for three minutes,
[02:08:52.455 --> 02:08:52.795]  I don't know.
[02:09:14.646 --> 02:09:29.155]  Well let me just add, I mean this happened twice in the last two years, where the Parliament didn't vote the way the Queen wanted on taxes and regulations, and on open borders, unlimited immigration, and the Queen
[02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:34.558]  Had her Governor General activate and just take control.
[02:09:34.558 --> 02:09:35.959]  And the media kept it real quiet.
[02:09:35.959 --> 02:09:37.840]  It was in a few newspapers.
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:47.026]  And of course, just a few months before that, I'd been on a CBC radio show with them laughing at me, saying, the Governor General will never trump our Parliament here.
[02:09:47.026 --> 02:09:49.748]  As I was talking about him doing it previously in Australia.
[02:09:49.748 --> 02:09:51.709]  And then it happened right after that.
[02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:54.651]  And since then, I've been on national CBC radio.
[02:09:54.651 --> 02:09:58.113]  And the host has had to admit, yes, we're totally run by the Queen.
[02:09:58.113 --> 02:09:58.794]  See, the Queen
[02:09:59.734 --> 02:10:11.622]  One of her sons owns the biggest publishing and TV production company that puts out almost all of the main scandal rags.
[02:10:11.622 --> 02:10:16.885]  And they report on themselves how they're pathetic and stupid and have no money.
[02:10:16.885 --> 02:10:20.788]  But it's this cute little thing that the British like to have, kind of for tourism.
[02:10:21.636 --> 02:10:24.817]  Okay, and it's a total psyop.
[02:10:24.817 --> 02:10:27.638]  And of course, her real money's a state secret.
[02:10:27.638 --> 02:10:32.640]  Show is it a state secret, Queen Beatrix, her cousin, over in the Netherlands.
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:38.061]  So, I mean, literally, she runs this country now.
[02:10:38.061 --> 02:10:39.742]  She runs Canada.
[02:10:39.742 --> 02:10:43.083]  She runs, and again, I was watching Sherlock Holmes.
[02:10:44.216 --> 02:10:47.777]  The new Sherlock Holmes, and it's all what really is going on.
[02:10:47.777 --> 02:10:49.778]  Satanists are running things.
[02:10:49.778 --> 02:10:56.560]  All the top British lords that are in the government, not the general lords, but the top British lords are Satanists.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:04.222]  They're into Luciferianism, and they've secretly taken America back over, and they orchestrated the Civil War in the U.S.
[02:11:04.222 --> 02:11:07.163]  to break America up, but Sherlock Holmes stops them.
[02:11:07.163 --> 02:11:09.664]  Well, it's actually on record the British finance the South.
[02:11:10.644 --> 02:11:13.986]  Uh, and put troops in the North, and I'm not saying I'm for the North, folks.
[02:11:13.986 --> 02:11:15.027]  Nobody was a winner here.
[02:11:15.027 --> 02:11:16.288]  They were manipulating both sides.
[02:11:16.288 --> 02:11:17.069]  That's the point.
[02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:19.510]  We're always taught to believe one side or the other.
[02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:23.593]  And here they are just throwing real history in our face in a Hollywood movie.
[02:11:23.593 --> 02:11:24.814]  Uh, just amazing.
[02:11:24.814 --> 02:11:27.476]  Uh, but, but that is the reality.
[02:11:27.476 --> 02:11:31.539]  We have been taken over by British intelligence, and that's what the CFR is.
[02:11:31.539 --> 02:11:31.879]  Go ahead.
[02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:41.615]  Oh, in addition to this, there's a little article in the paper that says Pope begs for forgiveness for child sex abuse.
[02:11:41.615 --> 02:11:52.741]  So this is Club of Rome, and the response was inherently problematic because of the church's ancient, unhealthy, monoclerical structures.
[02:11:52.741 --> 02:11:56.863]  So that substantiates what you have just said.
[02:11:56.863 --> 02:11:58.184]  Well, it's incredible.
[02:12:00.845 --> 02:12:01.645]  That's amazing.
[02:12:01.645 --> 02:12:08.869]  I mean, any type of society or organization that doesn't let men get married, you're going to end up having men having sex with men.
[02:12:08.869 --> 02:12:20.575]  I mean, look at historically with sailors and pirates, no matter whatever it was, Asian pirates, Anglo pirates, there ended up being a lot of that going on.
[02:12:20.575 --> 02:12:24.517]  And I mean, and then you've got these men over kids.
[02:12:24.517 --> 02:12:25.258]  What's going to happen?
[02:12:25.258 --> 02:12:28.199]  I mean, it's terrible and it needs to be exposed.
[02:12:28.199 --> 02:12:29.120]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:30.564 --> 02:12:33.405]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gabriel in New York.
[02:12:33.405 --> 02:12:34.646]  Gabriel, you're on the air.
[02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:35.687]  Welcome.
[02:12:35.687 --> 02:12:36.667]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[02:12:36.667 --> 02:12:38.028]  It's Gabriel from New York.
[02:12:38.028 --> 02:12:39.228]  I've called him before.
[02:12:39.228 --> 02:12:44.111]  I have two important things I want to talk about with regards to Memorial Day.
[02:12:44.111 --> 02:12:45.972]  It just passed on the 4th of July.
[02:12:45.972 --> 02:12:48.113]  That's coming up.
[02:12:48.113 --> 02:12:52.135]  I'm the caller who sent in the pictures of the machine guns at the beach.
[02:12:52.135 --> 02:12:56.737]  This year, they weren't as visible from the reports I got from We Are Change Hempstead.
[02:12:56.737 --> 02:12:58.978]  I'm also a We Are Change New York member.
[02:12:59.859 --> 02:13:04.704]  There were snipers on the rooftops from multiple eyewitnesses.
[02:13:04.704 --> 02:13:08.928]  Unfortunately, there's no photos of that, but they were there on the rooftops.
[02:13:08.928 --> 02:13:23.301]  And as an activist point, what I did was I printed up a hundred Oath Keeper flyers and I handed them out to all the military guys in my town, and a lot of people were very receptive to that, and a few even came back to me and said thank you.
[02:13:24.929 --> 02:13:29.331]  Well, good job, but let me illustrate something here and I need to get your photos.
[02:13:29.331 --> 02:13:39.616]  Kentucky Derby, Super Bowl, high school football, high school basketball, baseball, small events, you know, in the middle of rural areas even, they will have snipers on roofs
[02:13:40.416 --> 02:13:51.890]  They will have checkpoints, they'll have regular army or National Guard there, and they act like everybody's a suspect terrorist, and then you get their internal training manuals, who are they looking for?
[02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:55.354]  Gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, especially veterans.
[02:13:55.714 --> 02:13:58.216]  This is all on record for those that just joined us.
[02:13:58.216 --> 02:14:00.518]  MIAC Report, Homeland Security.
[02:14:00.518 --> 02:14:03.700]  We broke that last year, but we'd covered that for years with separate documents.
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:07.343]  It just happened to become national news finally, so people understood.
[02:14:07.343 --> 02:14:17.150]  Meanwhile, 80 to 100 miles into Arizona, mass murders, houses being burned, the police saying we've lost control, drug dealers, illegal aliens.
[02:14:17.150 --> 02:14:22.894]  In fact, roll some of that video from the news of just illegals climbing over everything, cars, shootouts, dead bodies.
[02:14:24.155 --> 02:14:25.797]  I mean, this is bedlam.
[02:14:25.797 --> 02:14:28.159]  Plots to blow up a dam in South Texas.
[02:14:28.159 --> 02:14:33.284]  That's WOAI television and the Houston Chronicle.
[02:14:33.284 --> 02:14:35.707]  I mean, just total lawless bedlam.
[02:14:37.199 --> 02:14:43.365]  But meanwhile, no police, no military, and the dominant news says it's not a problem.
[02:14:43.365 --> 02:14:51.673]  And then, Senator Kyle says he's in a meeting with Obama last month, and Obama said, I'm going to leave the borders open and we want this crime.
[02:14:51.673 --> 02:14:53.215]  We're holding the people hostage.
[02:14:53.215 --> 02:14:55.217]  This is Senator Kyle.
[02:14:55.217 --> 02:14:59.341]  We're letting the crisis develop, was Obama's words, so we can pass immigration reform.
[02:15:00.307 --> 02:15:04.110]  I mean, this is an admission of false flag terror.
[02:15:04.110 --> 02:15:06.933]  This is so huge.
[02:15:06.933 --> 02:15:08.854]  Anything else, Gabriel?
[02:15:08.854 --> 02:15:09.395]  Of course.
[02:15:09.395 --> 02:15:13.959]  Actually, I still have a few things I want to bring up for the 4th of July coming up.
[02:15:13.959 --> 02:15:14.920]  I have an idea.
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:17.562]  Short-term achievements for long-term solutions.
[02:15:17.562 --> 02:15:20.064]  That's a campaign slogan I'm working on.
[02:15:20.064 --> 02:15:24.288]  I'm giving a call out to every We Are Change chapter, to everybody in general.
[02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:28.974]  This 4th of July, pick up as many pocket constitutions as you possibly can.
[02:15:28.974 --> 02:15:33.079]  Citizens rule books, which, you know, you can pick up at Infowars or wherever.
[02:15:33.079 --> 02:15:34.600]  And let's get them out to the people.
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:37.864]  And every 4th of July, we need to start giving out constitutions to people.
[02:15:37.864 --> 02:15:41.928]  We need to level the playing field to allow people to know their rights.
[02:15:41.928 --> 02:15:47.574]  How are we going to have a discussion with people if they don't even know what their rights are to begin with, to even know they're having their rights taken away?
[02:15:48.007 --> 02:15:55.270]  And that's something that we all need to start doing every 4th of July and every election period, right before the election takes place.
[02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:58.571]  Well said, well said.
[02:15:58.571 --> 02:15:59.611]  Gabriel, good to hear from you.
[02:15:59.611 --> 02:16:00.792]  Keep it up.
[02:16:00.792 --> 02:16:03.213]  Let's talk to Jason in Texas.
[02:16:03.213 --> 02:16:05.433]  Jason, you're on the air.
[02:16:05.433 --> 02:16:14.997]  Yeah, Alex, I'm a Special Operations veteran, post-9-11, and after I got out of Spec Ops, I actually stepped over into security contracting.
[02:16:14.997 --> 02:16:17.718]  Before I did, I actually viewed
[02:16:18.266 --> 02:16:34.336]  A lot of your documentaries and stuff, and when I went over, actually, when I went through the training, I spoke to a lot of guys who were, you know, ex-special ops, and they were all going over for security contracting, specifically just for the money, because the money's good and the economy was bad.
[02:16:34.336 --> 02:16:42.401]  And a lot of these guys are aware, but when I went over, I'd let a lot of guys see these documentaries.
[02:16:42.401 --> 02:16:45.403]  I'd let them see Endgame, Bohemian Grove,
[02:16:46.195 --> 02:16:46.656]  All right.
[02:17:02.341 --> 02:17:06.923]  And these guys completely had changed their initial views.
[02:17:06.923 --> 02:17:08.763]  Everybody used to gather... But do you know why they changed?
[02:17:08.763 --> 02:17:11.104]  And I want to hold you over, but to interrupt.
[02:17:11.104 --> 02:17:13.965]  They changed because they already knew what I was telling them.
[02:17:13.965 --> 02:17:14.986]  They're not stupid.
[02:17:14.986 --> 02:17:23.129]  People already subconsciously, spiritually, and intellectually already have all the pieces, and nothing makes sense from mainstream media.
[02:17:23.129 --> 02:17:25.470]  Then when you actually start looking at globalist documents,
[02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:29.311]  The globalists all openly talk about what they're doing to each other.
[02:17:29.311 --> 02:17:34.453]  And they think we're so stupid, their miscalculation is their battle plan is public.
[02:17:34.453 --> 02:17:36.974]  This is naked what we're facing.
[02:17:36.974 --> 02:17:40.035]  But that's the same intel I get and I see on the street.
[02:17:40.035 --> 02:17:46.377]  I can't tell you how many times I have Fort Hood troops who are in Austin eating dinner and see me on the street or something when I'm out.
[02:17:46.377 --> 02:17:52.839]  And I've even had a colonel run over and say, look, don't say my name on air, but a lot of us are awake at Fort Hood.
[02:17:52.839 --> 02:17:55.060]  And just huge amounts of troops
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:55.760]  Yeah, no.
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:57.300]  I mean, exactly what you said right now.
[02:17:57.300 --> 02:18:00.681]  A lot of the tools, I was able to show them documents that were declassified.
[02:18:00.681 --> 02:18:05.442]  The stuff that you talk about, I was able to pull up on PDFs and actually show them these declassified
[02:18:23.519 --> 02:18:51.299]  And for me, you know, there's a risk because, obviously, we work with security clearances and all that kind of stuff, and so, you know, I went out on a limb, and the people's mindset, just like you said, they do have a weird feeling about things, and then when they receive the information, it only confirms that, so in like chow halls and stuff, we'd be sitting there, and initially, everybody would be watching Fox News just gobbling it up like, you know, grits, and then by the end of it, before I had left this last year,
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:59.244]  I had, you know, the guys that I had been there for the last two years, they were analyzing the propaganda, they were able to see it, they were discerning it.
[02:18:59.244 --> 02:19:09.710]  Exactly, and then once you show somebody, we don't tell people what to think, once you show them there's an agenda, then the propaganda only irritates and motivates resistance.
[02:19:09.710 --> 02:19:12.772]  That's what I found, and we're going to kick these people's butts.
[02:19:12.772 --> 02:19:21.057]  That's why they're blowing oil wells and about to start a new war and trying to bankrupt us, because we're going to beat them if we decide we're going to beat them.
[02:19:21.869 --> 02:19:23.431]  Exactly.
[02:19:23.431 --> 02:19:30.481]  I mean I hope people realize that we're going to beat this new world order and kick them out of America and save this country and get a reprieve like none of us got.
[02:19:30.481 --> 02:19:38.552]  Our biggest problem is they've taught the Christian churches that it's the end of the world, that it's a foregone conclusion, and that we are meant to lose.
[02:19:39.218 --> 02:19:41.400]  Look, let's say I'm going to lose next week.
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:42.702]  I'm not joining evil.
[02:19:42.702 --> 02:19:43.803]  I'm not giving in to this.
[02:19:43.803 --> 02:19:46.365]  I'm going to fight these people no matter what it is.
[02:19:46.365 --> 02:19:47.226]  So, fine.
[02:19:47.226 --> 02:19:49.348]  Jesus is coming back next month.
[02:19:49.348 --> 02:19:52.932]  I'm going to fight the New World Order until the minute he arrives.
[02:19:52.932 --> 02:19:55.295]  Anything else you want to add, caller?
[02:19:55.295 --> 02:19:55.815]  No, Alex.
[02:19:55.815 --> 02:19:56.276]  Thanks a lot.
[02:19:56.276 --> 02:19:57.156]  Just keep it up, man.
[02:19:57.156 --> 02:19:57.877]  You're awesome.
[02:19:57.877 --> 02:19:58.838]  Jason, God bless you.
[02:19:58.838 --> 02:19:59.359]  You're awesome.
[02:20:00.953 --> 02:20:10.161]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:10.161 --> 02:20:13.724]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[02:20:13.724 --> 02:20:23.312]  Introducing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:20:23.312 --> 02:20:28.577]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[02:20:28.857 --> 02:20:44.301]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns, with absolutely no apologies.
[02:20:44.301 --> 02:20:48.922]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[02:20:48.922 --> 02:20:53.103]  That's right, free for our listeners who sign up at OffTheGridNews.com.
[02:20:53.103 --> 02:20:55.284]  That's OffTheGridNews.com.
[02:20:55.284 --> 02:20:56.244]  You can sign up free.
[02:20:57.365 --> 02:21:03.508]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.508 --> 02:21:05.890]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:09.092]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.092 --> 02:21:14.215]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.215 --> 02:21:18.398]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.718 --> 02:21:21.062]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.062 --> 02:21:23.606]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.606 --> 02:21:26.870]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:34.462]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.782 --> 02:21:40.183]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.183 --> 02:21:42.504]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.504 --> 02:21:46.725]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.725 --> 02:21:47.805]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.805 --> 02:21:49.146]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:49.146 --> 02:21:50.626]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:01.149 --> 02:22:02.170]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:02.170 --> 02:22:07.712]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:07.712 --> 02:22:08.252]  I get it.
[02:22:08.252 --> 02:22:17.877]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:17.877 --> 02:22:19.277]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:19.277 --> 02:22:25.520]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:27.741]  Or that your retirement will be secure.
[02:22:27.741 --> 02:22:31.142]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:31.142 --> 02:22:35.403]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:35.403 --> 02:22:37.003]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.003 --> 02:22:40.404]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:40.404 --> 02:22:44.785]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:44.785 --> 02:22:45.686]  You should too.
[02:22:45.686 --> 02:22:46.826]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:46.826 --> 02:22:50.087]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:50.367 --> 02:22:50.667]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.667 --> 02:22:52.248]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.248 --> 02:23:00.552]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.552 --> 02:23:03.193]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:23:03.193 --> 02:23:06.755]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:23:06.755 --> 02:23:15.239]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:23:15.239 --> 02:23:20.122]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food.
[02:23:20.723 --> 02:23:26.344]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:23:26.344 --> 02:23:34.386]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[02:23:34.386 --> 02:23:39.848]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:23:39.848 --> 02:23:41.048]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:23:41.668 --> 02:23:47.516]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:23:47.516 --> 02:23:50.499]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[02:23:50.499 --> 02:23:53.783]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:23:53.783 --> 02:23:55.245]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[02:24:06.394 --> 02:24:09.375]  You know, it's not hype to say we're waking up the military and the police.
[02:24:09.375 --> 02:24:13.336]  And I know if we reach out to them, we can wake them up.
[02:24:13.336 --> 02:24:15.317]  Most of them are good men and women.
[02:24:15.317 --> 02:24:24.119]  And I tend to do harm sometimes when I fly off the handle and start foaming at the mouth about police and military, when I see them engaging in treason.
[02:24:24.119 --> 02:24:27.760]  You know, I got this AP video.
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:33.402]  Did you guys see the video I sent you of the old woman and they go kill her little dog in her house?
[02:24:33.402 --> 02:24:35.763]  And then the cops are defending themselves?
[02:24:38.789 --> 02:24:40.831]  Her grandson hadn't lived there in 12 years.
[02:24:40.831 --> 02:24:42.071]  He's 28 years old now.
[02:24:42.071 --> 02:24:44.373]  That's one of the last known addresses they've got.
[02:24:44.373 --> 02:24:47.235]  They show up with a warrant.
[02:24:47.235 --> 02:24:50.718]  And she comes to the door and she says, let me put my dog in the bathroom.
[02:24:50.718 --> 02:24:52.299]  And she puts the dog in the bathroom.
[02:24:52.299 --> 02:24:53.720]  And it's a little dog.
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:54.740]  I don't even know what type it is.
[02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:55.741]  They never say on the news.
[02:24:55.741 --> 02:24:58.503]  It's like some little mutt.
[02:24:58.503 --> 02:24:59.764]  I mean, there it is.
[02:24:59.764 --> 02:25:00.284]  Very vicious.
[02:25:05.626 --> 02:25:09.527]  They put it in the bathroom and the cops went in the bathroom and it growled at them so they shot it.
[02:25:09.527 --> 02:25:10.867]  That is standard procedure.
[02:25:10.867 --> 02:25:12.627]  They call it dog-killing detail.
[02:25:12.627 --> 02:25:20.809]  Meanwhile, in the name of stopping drugs, the government literally ships the majority of in on record now.
[02:25:20.809 --> 02:25:23.950]  They won't stop what's happening on our borders where it's just total bedlam.
[02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:26.710]  Because there's people shooting back, folks.
[02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:29.291]  I mean, since when did Americans become so cowardly?
[02:25:29.291 --> 02:25:30.411]  If you're going to have
[02:25:31.798 --> 02:25:34.299]  A law about drugs?
[02:25:34.299 --> 02:25:38.840]  What are you doing trying to bust some guy who may have a quarter ounce of marijuana?
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:42.861]  Why aren't you going after the people that are bringing tons of cocaine in?
[02:25:42.861 --> 02:25:45.842]  I'm done talking about it.
[02:25:45.842 --> 02:25:55.005]  See, I start talking about how I don't want to be angry at the police and military, but then I get angry just thinking about it, but it's the leadership, it's the policies, it's how they've been directed.
[02:25:55.005 --> 02:25:56.686]  I mean, look at this article.
[02:25:56.686 --> 02:25:57.566]  This is Mother Jones.
[02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:00.542]  We've already seen reports of this in the news.
[02:26:00.542 --> 02:26:04.287]  Louisiana police pull over activists at behest of BP.
[02:26:04.287 --> 02:26:05.929]  Everyone knows how the BP is...
[02:26:07.146 --> 02:26:11.168]  Still blocking press access to the oil spill sites, even though they're not supposed to anymore.
[02:26:11.168 --> 02:26:12.229]  Yeah, that's on record.
[02:26:12.229 --> 02:26:14.190]  The police have been told, by the way, that that's illegal.
[02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:18.672]  Just to have some private contractor just claim no one can be on a beach?
[02:26:18.672 --> 02:26:31.759]  I've been blathering about it for weeks, and it's been all over three days since four contractors wouldn't let me through the Ponte Ox Marina outside of Louisiana.
[02:26:34.488 --> 02:26:59.645]  And though as of June 16th, the federal government has been saying helicopters could fly reporters as low as 1,500 feet around spill sites, on June 17th, I was on a helicopter that was prohibited from flying below 3,000 feet, and whose pilot was, uh, flipped silent birds as the military guys coming over the radio and hassling him about being in the area
[02:27:00.743 --> 02:27:01.203]  At all.
[02:27:01.203 --> 02:27:02.924]  So some type of electronic bird flipping.
[02:27:02.924 --> 02:27:06.766]  I don't know that communication or nomenclature.
[02:27:06.766 --> 02:27:17.070]  But Louisiana State Police pulling over a video camera wielding private citizen because the head of BP security wanted to ask him some questions is a whole other level of alarming.
[02:27:17.070 --> 02:27:23.133]  Yeah, folks, I'm consulting on Ventura's TV show right now.
[02:27:23.133 --> 02:27:27.255]  I am making my own film on eugenics and chemtrails right now.
[02:27:27.255 --> 02:27:29.836]  I am doing radio interviews every day.
[02:27:31.567 --> 02:27:35.250]  I'm not complaining, I just really don't have time to go to Louisiana.
[02:27:35.250 --> 02:27:36.792]  And then not be here on the radio!
[02:27:36.792 --> 02:27:38.713]  I mean, do you not want me to be here?
[02:27:44.665 --> 02:27:49.930]  I guess I could try to take some digital gear and do the show from there, but then I'm sitting there four hours a day.
[02:27:49.930 --> 02:27:51.231]  I guess that's the answer.
[02:27:51.231 --> 02:28:00.040]  In fact, just go ahead now and get speed order the, because we've got one that's in the rack, but a Comrex unit that's portable.
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:01.381]  Then I got to find hotels that
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:08.823]  Don't have phone lines or digital lines that put gates on it, because we've hooked them up before, and then the hotel firewall won't let you connect.
[02:28:08.823 --> 02:28:10.364]  I mean, I'm not complaining.
[02:28:10.364 --> 02:28:11.764]  It's just, it's a nightmare.
[02:28:11.764 --> 02:28:14.765]  You're sitting there for an hour or two trying to get connected to the network.
[02:28:14.765 --> 02:28:17.527]  Then maybe it's not a good connection.
[02:28:17.527 --> 02:28:19.928]  Maybe it's breaking up sometimes.
[02:28:19.928 --> 02:28:22.569]  I mean, the Skype connection we have to England is phenomenal.
[02:28:22.569 --> 02:28:24.410]  It sounds like broadcast radio.
[02:28:24.410 --> 02:28:26.491]  That's why we're having Paul Watson on.
[02:28:26.491 --> 02:28:28.952]  Of course, now he's moving to another city in England.
[02:28:31.171 --> 02:28:39.179]  But his girlfriend's getting her PhD in another city, but watch, I bet his Skype doesn't work well from the new location.
[02:28:39.179 --> 02:28:45.725]  But I was like, finally, I've got somebody who can fill in for me who's intelligent and sounds great.
[02:28:45.725 --> 02:28:48.287]  So we'll see how long that lasts.
[02:28:48.287 --> 02:28:51.990]  But I'm already digressing here.
[02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:53.972]  It's just I read stuff like this.
[02:28:53.972 --> 02:28:56.014]  I want to go directly to where this happened.
[02:28:58.143 --> 02:28:59.924]  Oh, you want to ask me questions, officer?
[02:28:59.924 --> 02:29:02.665]  Yeah, I've noticed when you cowl, though, the cops, like, think it's normal.
[02:29:02.665 --> 02:29:06.927]  It's like, you're pulling me over with a video camera because BP wants to know?
[02:29:06.927 --> 02:29:08.448]  I'm here to cover this.
[02:29:08.448 --> 02:29:20.533]  Haven't you heard the big international scandal that all these reporters were forced off beaches by police under BP orders and that you've been told and been told even by the president and the governors not to do this?
[02:29:20.533 --> 02:29:21.434]  What is your name?
[02:29:21.914 --> 02:29:24.816]  And if I get a hothead cop on roids, he'll probably just kill me right there.
[02:29:24.816 --> 02:29:31.259]  I mean, you know, Lord know I'm an evil American who wants to be able to go tell people what's happening at the Gulf.
[02:29:31.259 --> 02:29:32.960]  And who wants to bring BP to justice.
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:33.761]  Isn't that what you want?
[02:29:33.761 --> 02:29:36.142]  I mean, how do they get cops to act like this?
[02:29:36.142 --> 02:29:39.984]  What planet do they find these lunatics on?
[02:29:39.984 --> 02:29:40.684]  Wake up!
[02:29:40.684 --> 02:29:46.588]  Now, I know a lot of cops are cool, and maybe they're scared for their jobs and want to follow these orders, but that doesn't cut it, man.
[02:29:46.588 --> 02:29:50.070]  You know how many sacrifices I've made to not compromise?
[02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.590]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:51.178 --> 02:29:55.101]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.101 --> 02:30:00.465]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:00.273 --> 02:31:04.454]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:04.454 --> 02:31:10.876]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:10.876 --> 02:31:18.259]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:18.259 --> 02:31:23.120]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:31:24.741 --> 02:31:31.787]  By calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:31:31.787 --> 02:31:36.051]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:31:36.051 --> 02:31:42.277]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:31:42.817 --> 02:31:46.719]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:32:01.909 --> 02:32:05.872]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:05.872 --> 02:32:14.739]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:32:14.739 --> 02:32:19.362]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:32:19.362 --> 02:32:30.191]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:32:30.811 --> 02:32:40.314]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:40.314 --> 02:32:45.736]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:32:45.736 --> 02:32:53.239]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:53.239 --> 02:32:55.980]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:33:00.106 --> 02:33:06.811]  A 62-year-old grandmother is mad and grieving after police shot and killed her 13-year-old dog, Wrinkles.
[02:33:06.811 --> 02:33:11.114]  You can see all the bullet holes, about eight bullet holes, all up and down the steps of bullets everywhere.
[02:33:11.114 --> 02:33:19.781]  Marietta Robinson says officers showed up with a search warrant for drugs in relation to her 28-year-old grandson, and she left them in her house under one condition.
[02:33:19.781 --> 02:33:22.043]  I asked his permission.
[02:33:22.043 --> 02:33:25.865]  May I put my dog in the bathroom or in the backyard?
[02:33:25.865 --> 02:33:27.146]  He said, go ahead and put her in the bathroom.
[02:33:27.146 --> 02:33:27.787]  We're not gonna hurt her.
[02:33:27.927 --> 02:33:31.551]  But Wrinkles was killed anyway after an officer opened the bathroom door.
[02:33:31.551 --> 02:33:37.038]  They started shooting the dog and I screamed and I backed up and I went around this way and I said, please don't shoot him!
[02:33:37.038 --> 02:33:39.400]  Police say the dog attacked an officer.
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:43.746]  Robinson says officers even used her water cooler after killing her dog.
[02:33:43.746 --> 02:33:45.728]  They washed their hands in my drinking water!
[02:33:45.888 --> 02:33:51.072]  Robinson says the shooting never had to happen because her grandson hasn't lived in her home for 12 years.
[02:33:51.072 --> 02:33:54.234]  My grandson couldn't come in here because he hasn't lived here so long.
[02:33:54.234 --> 02:33:55.796]  My dog don't know my grandson.
[02:33:55.796 --> 02:33:57.557]  We looked through the whole incident.
[02:33:57.557 --> 02:34:00.699]  Police are investigating to see if any policies were violated.
[02:34:00.699 --> 02:34:02.080]  They can't bring me my dog back.
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:03.201]  I don't want no apology.
[02:34:03.201 --> 02:34:06.444]  They need to be fired and get somebody on the job that know what they're doing.
[02:34:06.444 --> 02:34:11.007]  Robinson says police told her they found bags with drug residue inside.
[02:34:11.007 --> 02:34:13.209]  She says they're fortune cookie wrappers.
[02:34:13.789 --> 02:34:18.350]  Myra Lopez, the Associated Press.
[02:34:18.350 --> 02:34:19.130]  You gotta love it.
[02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:22.311]  Some old woman, grandson, hadn't lived there in 12 years.
[02:34:22.311 --> 02:34:24.211]  They found some fortune cookie wrappers.
[02:34:24.211 --> 02:34:30.612]  I've seen them swat team a Patriot because they have an American flag or Gadsden flag sticker on their car.
[02:34:30.612 --> 02:34:33.153]  I got a clip of this from Road to Tyranny.
[02:34:33.153 --> 02:34:37.834]  From the news choppers and the police then tell them, yes, we found a pipe bomb.
[02:34:37.834 --> 02:34:41.415]  And then they show jumper cables and it came out in court and they had to drop the case.
[02:34:41.415 --> 02:34:42.875]  The fellow's name was Farrell Montgomery.
[02:34:44.016 --> 02:34:44.316]  I don't
[02:35:02.771 --> 02:35:04.692]  Why do you act like this?
[02:35:04.692 --> 02:35:06.453]  Why have you been trained to hate Americans?
[02:35:06.453 --> 02:35:11.437]  They're like attack dogs that have been trained, if they see an American or a patriot, they're bad.
[02:35:11.437 --> 02:35:14.218]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, has taught them this.
[02:35:14.218 --> 02:35:17.761]  Now, a lot of cops are waking up, but a lot of them aren't.
[02:35:17.761 --> 02:35:26.446]  And we now have this incredible video from Senator Kyle up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:26.446 --> 02:35:29.789]  I want to play that one more time before we go to Alan Watt, because that's the first
[02:35:30.709 --> 02:35:33.410]  issue I want to raise with him.
[02:35:33.410 --> 02:35:37.352]  Do we have that video, Senator Kyle, ready?
[02:35:37.352 --> 02:35:42.174]  Great.
[02:35:42.174 --> 02:35:44.175]  Great.
[02:35:44.175 --> 02:35:56.921]  And in that Senator Kyle video, and the audio's not too good, but it's a video at a town hall, he clearly says, I was in a closed-door meeting with Obama, he says, I kicked everybody out, and he said, well,
[02:35:58.411 --> 02:36:00.512]  I didn't kick out General Jones.
[02:36:00.512 --> 02:36:03.174]  He's the head of national security, but I asked him to leave.
[02:36:03.174 --> 02:36:04.935]  And I said, Obama, why are you doing this?
[02:36:04.935 --> 02:36:10.998]  And Obama said, we need to continue the crisis down there so people will give us immigration reform, which means total amnesty.
[02:36:10.998 --> 02:36:12.819]  Then they just legalize all the illegals.
[02:36:12.819 --> 02:36:15.821]  And then the feds claim they're going to secure the borders.
[02:36:15.821 --> 02:36:18.202]  And that's what they've been telling the states for the last five years.
[02:36:18.202 --> 02:36:21.144]  That's really the Bush policy, which is the CFR policy.
[02:36:21.744 --> 02:36:23.645]  So you've got the border completely collapsing.
[02:36:23.645 --> 02:36:25.305]  Mexico is a failed state.
[02:36:25.305 --> 02:36:26.466]  All these murders.
[02:36:26.466 --> 02:36:29.247]  Sheriffs calling for help, saying they're being attacked, they're being killed.
[02:36:29.247 --> 02:36:32.989]  80 to 100 miles into Arizona, past Tucson.
[02:36:32.989 --> 02:36:37.851]  You can't go in the national parks as the illegals have just taken it over as drug corridors.
[02:36:37.851 --> 02:36:41.292]  All of this is going on.
[02:36:41.292 --> 02:36:44.973]  So, they have a crisis and can say, look at the problem.
[02:36:44.973 --> 02:36:47.414]  We need amnesty to fix it.
[02:36:47.414 --> 02:36:48.475]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:36:51.658 --> 02:36:52.439]  Why?
[02:36:52.439 --> 02:36:55.561]  I'll tell you why.
[02:36:55.561 --> 02:37:00.024]  I met with the President in the Oval Office, just the two of us.
[02:37:00.024 --> 02:37:02.726]  I kicked the rest of the people out.
[02:37:02.726 --> 02:37:05.688]  I asked them if they would leave.
[02:37:05.688 --> 02:37:06.368]  I'm sorry.
[02:37:06.368 --> 02:37:08.570]  And we had a discussion about it.
[02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:13.233]  Well, one was General Jones, the National Security Advisor, and I said no.
[02:37:13.233 --> 02:37:15.315]  But, anyway.
[02:37:15.315 --> 02:37:16.316]  Here's what the President said.
[02:37:16.316 --> 02:37:19.478]  The problem is, he said, if we secure the border,
[02:37:20.512 --> 02:37:21.353]  We're good.
[02:37:38.644 --> 02:37:39.665]  Alright.
[02:37:39.665 --> 02:37:41.607]  And then he goes on from there.
[02:37:41.607 --> 02:37:42.608]  Why is this important?
[02:37:42.608 --> 02:37:45.390]  It's another admission of problem-reaction-solution.
[02:37:45.390 --> 02:37:46.811]  Thousands are dead on the U.S.
[02:37:46.811 --> 02:37:47.452]  side.
[02:37:47.452 --> 02:37:49.294]  Twenty-plus thousand on the Mexican side.
[02:37:49.294 --> 02:37:51.435]  Most of it on the Texas-Arizona border.
[02:37:51.435 --> 02:37:52.957]  Some on the California-New Mexico.
[02:37:54.543 --> 02:37:57.004]  And, I mean, that is dereliction of duty.
[02:37:57.004 --> 02:38:00.986]  That is aiding and abetting murder and lawlessness and chaos.
[02:38:00.986 --> 02:38:05.929]  But this is the entire modus operandi of the globalist.
[02:38:05.929 --> 02:38:11.832]  So we go now to Alan Watt for the balance of the radio broadcast the next hour and 20 minutes, 22 minutes.
[02:38:11.832 --> 02:38:20.937]  Alan Watt is a long-term researcher into the causative forces behind major changes in historical development, and I found his research is spot-on.
[02:38:20.937 --> 02:38:22.218]  His background is that of a
[02:38:23.803 --> 02:38:30.950]  Renaissance man with a background in three professions, plus having various books published in religion, philosophy, poetry, mainly under pseudonyms.
[02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:40.220]  For much of his life, he has been heavily involved in the music industry, songwriter, singer, performer, involved in folk music, blues, pop, rock, even classical.
[02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:46.484]  Also known for his session guitar work, he has played with some of the best well-known artists and groups.
[02:38:46.484 --> 02:38:54.289]  Born in Scotland, he watched the subtleties of politics and the media as they guided the population of the UK covertly into the European amalgamation.
[02:38:54.289 --> 02:39:00.993]  He has been warning the North American people for some years now that the same process of amalgamation is being carried out.
[02:39:00.993 --> 02:39:09.579]  With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created and altered by those in control, also to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture, the next phase.
[02:39:10.599 --> 02:39:11.379]  We're good to go.
[02:39:29.705 --> 02:39:39.311]  Masterpiece that I've been really making the last three years since Endgame in the background and we've now decided to release it in October and so he's also gonna be part of that.
[02:39:39.311 --> 02:39:43.694]  But he is with us today and we're gonna be taking your calls continually into the next hour.
[02:39:43.694 --> 02:39:45.455]  But Alan, so much is going on.
[02:39:45.455 --> 02:39:56.843]  I want to talk to you about Tavistock Institute, one of the premier mind control organizations, how the media works, your take on the BP oil spill, the fact that they're more and more admitting the chemtrailing is going on but hiding it in plain view.
[02:39:58.004 --> 02:40:08.473]  The fact that the police and military are waking up, how you see the system trying to keep them under their brainwashing control, what the next phase of the economic collapse is, so much to discuss today.
[02:40:08.473 --> 02:40:13.938]  But out of the gates, you heard me play the clip of the cops come to the house, kill the small dog.
[02:40:13.938 --> 02:40:19.183]  It's an act of dominance, just like naked body scanners are an act of dominance.
[02:40:19.183 --> 02:40:21.665]  Even if the police are unconscious, this is why they've been given this training.
[02:40:22.606 --> 02:40:36.695]  And the illustration, though, of Obama saying openly to a senator, we're using this crisis, all this crime and murder that's going on, by contesting some of the private cartels not laundering their money through U.S.
[02:40:36.695 --> 02:40:38.516]  banks, knowing it would cause the crisis.
[02:40:38.516 --> 02:40:40.077]  We covered this five years ago.
[02:40:40.077 --> 02:40:43.800]  We're using that crisis to bring in our North American Union.
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:46.141]  And this is an amazing admission.
[02:40:46.141 --> 02:40:47.762]  Alan Watt?
[02:40:47.762 --> 02:40:50.224]  Yeah, it's common, too, that so many of them
[02:40:51.813 --> 02:40:53.936]  Hillary Clinton said the same thing, too, a while back.
[02:40:53.936 --> 02:40:55.258]  We'll use this crisis.
[02:40:55.258 --> 02:40:59.184]  You find the members of the Council on Foreign Relations saying the same thing.
[02:40:59.184 --> 02:41:02.610]  Never let a good crisis go to waste, because there is an agenda.
[02:41:03.584 --> 02:41:04.365]  I don't think so.
[02:41:25.356 --> 02:41:31.043]  Alan, let's go into that first because I haven't talked to you in a few months on air.
[02:41:31.043 --> 02:41:34.467]  I think I interviewed you right before the oil spill.
[02:41:34.467 --> 02:41:44.599]  Break down what you think is happening there and what they plan to get out of it for the viewers and listeners.
[02:41:45.781 --> 02:41:52.107]  Well, this New World Order anticipates what we're going through now, apart from the amalgamations of whole continents together.
[02:41:52.107 --> 02:41:56.692]  And remember, the NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, is still rushing ahead.
[02:41:57.669 --> 02:42:07.235]  It still has to have one more signature put on by the President and the Prime Ministers of Canada and Mexico, and that's legally binding.
[02:42:07.235 --> 02:42:10.077]  That's the fifth legal agreement.
[02:42:10.077 --> 02:42:11.698]  So, that's on the go.
[02:42:11.698 --> 02:42:18.802]  We also have the Sustainable Development, which is the whole way to control the world, really rushing forward.
[02:42:18.802 --> 02:42:23.745]  In Britain, for instance, and other countries, the past laws already, the European Union past laws,
[02:42:25.167 --> 02:42:35.714]  That come 2018 to 2020 all homes built must be sustainable and they're going to start finding those homes which are not thermal approved and all the rest of it.
[02:42:35.714 --> 02:42:36.974]  This is neo-feudalism.
[02:42:36.974 --> 02:42:54.006]  This is total serfdom to literally engage in siege as they state to cut off our energy, our calories so we cannot have children and we are total creatures of the states while the elite like Al Gore live in their giant mansions and are exempt from all the rules.
[02:42:54.646 --> 02:42:55.727]  Absolutely.
[02:42:55.727 --> 02:43:00.149]  And they're using every environmental reason to push it ahead.
[02:43:00.149 --> 02:43:04.050]  Now, they set up the carbon tax phenomenon quite a few years back.
[02:43:04.050 --> 02:43:06.311]  They're already trading carbon tax.
[02:43:06.311 --> 02:43:08.192]  Well, look at how for 20 years in the U.S.
[02:43:08.192 --> 02:43:13.114]  they try to restrict farmers and ranchers from building new barns.
[02:43:13.114 --> 02:43:16.256]  Supposedly, if there's ever a puddle during the year, they call it a wetland.
[02:43:16.256 --> 02:43:17.556]  I mean, we know their intent.
[02:43:17.556 --> 02:43:21.098]  These are vicious, vicious criminals.
[02:43:21.098 --> 02:43:23.039]  Yeah, they do believe that they have the right
[02:43:23.917 --> 02:43:36.568]  As an elite, to recreate the world in the image they say should be made in, and the democracy is too cumbersome to get their agendas through, so they must destroy democracy.
[02:43:36.568 --> 02:43:41.292]  And they do so by bringing in new regulations, new laws, and new rules.
[02:43:41.292 --> 02:43:45.156]  We adapt into them step by step by acquiescing to them.
[02:43:45.968 --> 02:43:49.390]  And that becomes the new law, the new way of living.
[02:43:49.390 --> 02:43:51.832]  And we're doing it all the time, incrementally.
[02:43:51.832 --> 02:43:53.473]  And they make it sexy.
[02:43:53.473 --> 02:44:00.097]  They finance top Hollywood people in the last decade going to these zero footprint spas and resorts, which is fine.
[02:44:00.097 --> 02:44:07.201]  I mean, that would be interesting, but that's to sell it to where then when you're made to do it, it's okay with you.
[02:44:07.201 --> 02:44:09.723]  And they admit this is to destroy our society.
[02:44:11.177 --> 02:44:11.818]  Absolutely.
[02:44:11.818 --> 02:44:16.202]  They've made it quite plain in their own writings, in their communiqués with each other.
[02:44:16.202 --> 02:44:23.708]  We've got the top environmentalists coming out now saying that democracy has to be put on hold now.
[02:44:25.116 --> 02:44:30.081]  For the environmental crisis and for the crisis with the food shortages coming and all this kind of stuff.
[02:44:30.081 --> 02:44:37.007]  And by the way, they are bringing on food shortages because they have put so many farmers out of business really since World War II.
[02:44:37.007 --> 02:44:37.448]  That's right.
[02:44:37.448 --> 02:44:49.539]  Now the UN, again to back you up, the UN who in their own State Department ran them 200 in their own documents in the 70s said we're going to cut off food, bring in GMOs, start wars, get people fighting with each other in different regions.
[02:44:49.539 --> 02:44:50.460]  Now they come out and say
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:54.043]  Yes, and they've already jacked up the prices of food twice already in the last few years, to what it was.
[02:44:54.043 --> 02:44:57.465]  And people don't really notice, they again adjust incrementally, step by step, into this new system.
[02:45:14.702 --> 02:45:22.009]  And five agri-food businesses have been given the power of controlling the entire food supply of the planet.
[02:45:22.009 --> 02:45:24.150]  So it's quite easy to bring on a crisis.
[02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:26.893]  It's easy to bring on rationing, which they will do, by the way.
[02:45:27.911 --> 02:45:29.752]  As they bring us into the new system.
[02:45:29.752 --> 02:45:32.173]  See, we're supposed to serve the new system.
[02:45:32.173 --> 02:45:33.994]  As you say, it's a feudal system.
[02:45:33.994 --> 02:45:35.094]  Carl Quigley said that.
[02:45:35.094 --> 02:45:42.217]  He says that it's to be a new feudal system, with the CEOs being the new feudal overlords in collusion with government.
[02:45:42.217 --> 02:45:48.840]  And it's to be a scientifically run society, not something that's debated on emotions.
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.582]  And that's what the New World Order is, basically.
[02:45:53.582 --> 02:45:53.863]  H.G.
[02:45:53.863 --> 02:45:55.783]  Wells wrote about it back in the 1920s in his own book.
[02:45:57.464 --> 02:45:59.565]  He called it a modern utopia.
[02:45:59.565 --> 02:46:15.955]  He said gradually, he says rather than kill off all those who are unfit and the ones with the lower IQs, the lower classes who will no longer be required in a post-industrial society, he says we shall simply sterilize them and allow them to die off gradually, peacefully.
[02:46:15.955 --> 02:46:18.657]  So this is the ongoing agenda.
[02:46:18.657 --> 02:46:20.718]  We've been going through it for over a hundred years now.
[02:46:21.457 --> 02:46:22.818]  And people don't know that.
[02:46:22.818 --> 02:46:27.901]  They think they're born into a system which must be normal on the basis that it exists.
[02:46:27.901 --> 02:46:29.582]  But nothing is further from the truth.
[02:46:29.582 --> 02:46:30.342]  It's not normal.
[02:46:30.342 --> 02:46:32.543]  It's a planned society.
[02:46:32.543 --> 02:46:33.424]  We get no peace.
[02:46:33.424 --> 02:46:39.487]  If you notice, not one single generation has been allowed any kind of peace for an awful long time.
[02:46:40.269 --> 02:46:40.910]  I think?
[02:46:58.943 --> 02:46:59.444]  Well, Alan,
[02:47:21.016 --> 02:47:24.677]  Suddenly, when you read the news, it's just everywhere.
[02:47:24.677 --> 02:47:26.537]  Oh, we've got to reduce the world population.
[02:47:26.537 --> 02:47:27.757]  We can only have one child.
[02:47:27.757 --> 02:47:34.459]  Suddenly, Peter Singers in the New York Times, who calls humans a disease and a cancer, saying, maybe we're the last generation.
[02:47:34.459 --> 02:47:35.519]  That was the headline.
[02:47:35.519 --> 02:47:38.239]  Maybe no children should be the law.
[02:47:38.239 --> 02:47:44.340]  And again, it's sold in MTV and the colleges as cool and fun.
[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:46.961]  They're selling people pure death.
[02:47:47.501 --> 02:48:02.294]  And there's this attitude where they train the yuppies that feel like they're part of the establishment to giggle and laugh about their enslavement, believing that because they laugh and giggle about it and have smart mouth comments about it that somehow they're part of it.
[02:48:02.294 --> 02:48:03.836]  What do you call that phenomenon?
[02:48:03.836 --> 02:48:07.859]  Because I've always noticed it and haven't heard really anybody else talk about it.
[02:48:07.859 --> 02:48:13.824]  I was listening to Michael Savage last week and I heard him spend about 20 minutes when I was driving home ranting about how
[02:48:14.505 --> 02:48:19.066]  They hate life, they hate money, they hate wealth in anybody's hands but themselves.
[02:48:19.066 --> 02:48:20.526]  They giggle, they laugh.
[02:48:20.526 --> 02:48:27.408]  He called them curly-haired, coke bottle, highly intelligent deviants.
[02:48:27.408 --> 02:48:31.128]  They're almost nihilist or low-key saboteurs.
[02:48:31.128 --> 02:48:39.110]  Even the minions that serve the system know enough of the evil, but they almost cheerlead it.
[02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:42.671]  They hate beauty and they love macabre disease.
[02:48:44.071 --> 02:48:45.932]  What are these creatures?
[02:48:45.932 --> 02:48:51.254]  What you've got is an institutionalized, sadomasochistic society.
[02:48:51.254 --> 02:48:58.898]  And this is well proven with scientific studies on dictators and all those who follow and obey the dictators.
[02:48:58.898 --> 02:49:08.582]  At the Nuremberg trial, for instance, they found out that all of the officers immediately around Adolf Hitler still adored him up until their deaths.
[02:49:08.582 --> 02:49:10.323]  They thought he was a god, pretty well.
[02:49:11.088 --> 02:49:19.995]  And in a ranking system of authority, the psychopath admires the one with more power above them and despises the lesser beneath them.
[02:49:19.995 --> 02:49:23.117]  So he's a sadistic to the one beneath them.
[02:49:23.117 --> 02:49:35.486]  And you have a deviant sadomasochistic system in operation today with everything that comes from deviancy, including into the perversions of the sexual area too.
[02:49:35.486 --> 02:49:36.667]  That's rampant today.
[02:49:36.667 --> 02:49:38.849]  It's taught today, in fact, as a new normal.
[02:49:39.729 --> 02:49:41.431]  Winning is normal now.
[02:49:41.431 --> 02:49:42.451]  Defeating people.
[02:49:42.451 --> 02:49:45.193]  If you're defeated, there's no such thing as well done.
[02:49:45.193 --> 02:49:46.494]  You did your best.
[02:49:46.494 --> 02:49:47.955]  They literally despise you.
[02:49:47.955 --> 02:49:48.555]  They hate you.
[02:49:48.555 --> 02:49:49.636]  They want to destroy you.
[02:49:49.636 --> 02:49:54.339]  And if you grovel to them for help, they will destroy you.
[02:49:54.339 --> 02:49:55.640]  That is the system we're in.
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:58.102]  You've got a generation raised on power.
[02:49:59.035 --> 02:50:08.268]  All a youngster will see today is the video games with the biggest monster beating all the rest and that's what he admires.
[02:50:08.268 --> 02:50:11.212]  When he grows up he wants to be on the winning team.
[02:50:11.212 --> 02:50:15.878]  All he sees are the cops in all the cop movies with authority, machine guns.
[02:50:16.519 --> 02:50:17.500]  We're good to go.
[02:50:31.921 --> 02:50:38.185]  They show them the archetypal torturing beast and say, this is the new hero.
[02:50:38.185 --> 02:50:40.447]  This is the male model.
[02:50:40.447 --> 02:50:50.093]  Not a loving, caring, intelligent male who fights if they have to, but is an inventor and a teacher and someone who has depth.
[02:50:50.093 --> 02:50:53.355]  No, they're teaching the young males, be a mindless idiot.
[02:50:53.355 --> 02:50:54.436]  Be a thug.
[02:50:54.436 --> 02:50:55.777]  You will have power.
[02:50:55.777 --> 02:50:57.218]  We'll be back with Al Monwant.
[02:50:57.218 --> 02:50:57.698]  Stay with us.

[02:52:05.511 --> 02:52:06.773]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:06.773 --> 02:52:10.517]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.517 --> 02:52:12.960]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:18.346]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:18.806 --> 02:52:25.469]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.469 --> 02:52:31.451]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.451 --> 02:52:35.133]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:52:35.633 --> 02:52:39.916]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:49.423]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.423 --> 02:52:51.404]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.404 --> 02:52:52.525]  It's here.

[02:53:12.235 --> 02:53:14.136]  But first, the facts.
[02:53:14.136 --> 02:53:16.077]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:53:16.077 --> 02:53:18.057]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:53:18.057 --> 02:53:21.739]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:53:21.739 --> 02:53:29.502]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:53:29.502 --> 02:53:30.102]  Sinofresh.

[02:53:51.053 --> 02:53:51.233]  It works!
[02:54:18.022 --> 02:54:18.824]  Yeah.
[02:54:26.852 --> 02:54:28.753]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:28.753 --> 02:54:38.781]  I think the reason this radio show has been so successful is the guests, the information, the analysis, the films, the news websites, but also, I am frantic.
[02:54:38.781 --> 02:54:42.924]  I've always telegraphed a sense of urgency because I'm genuinely feeling it.
[02:54:42.924 --> 02:54:51.330]  And when Alan Watt and many others I respect, of course I can feel it in my gut and see it intellectually as well, said the quickening is now here a few years ago.
[02:54:51.330 --> 02:54:53.372]  You're going to see an acceleration.
[02:54:53.372 --> 02:54:55.714]  It's one thing to psychologically and intellectually
[02:54:56.897 --> 02:55:07.499]  Coldly understand we're going into the big plunge, but it's another thing to actually now be living it and experiencing it going down this slide as it accelerates.
[02:55:07.499 --> 02:55:18.762]  Alan Watt, getting more into the oil spill and what you believe is behind that, and now where all of this is going to go, what your intel is on Iran.
[02:55:18.762 --> 02:55:23.743]  They're openly saying they're going to attack it now, just brazenly hiding it in plain view.
[02:55:23.743 --> 02:55:24.503]  Go over that for us.
[02:55:25.421 --> 02:55:34.634]  Well, we know that the attack on Iran is a continuation of the same policy of the Project for a New American Century.
[02:55:34.634 --> 02:55:39.561]  They elicited the countries they wanted to attack when they were in collusion with Israel.
[02:55:40.422 --> 02:55:40.763]  I think?
[02:56:00.846 --> 02:56:10.532]  And as Jefferson said, when you see the same policies going through, even though the House of Congress has changed with a new party, he said then, no, then you're under tyranny.
[02:56:10.532 --> 02:56:18.957]  Well, we've been seeing the same policies for many, many Houses changes, and the same policies go ahead regardless.
[02:56:18.957 --> 02:56:25.561]  Into the scientific socialism, as I said, where experts will guide our every move, everything that we do, even if we're born.
[02:56:26.221 --> 02:56:29.144]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:56:29.144 --> 02:56:32.568]  The Gulf idea, they need a catastrophe.
[02:56:32.568 --> 02:56:33.869]  They needed a catastrophe.
[02:56:33.869 --> 02:56:42.478]  Same as the 9-11, the New American Century said, we need something on the scale of Pearl Harbor to motivate the American public behind a war.
[02:56:42.478 --> 02:56:45.161]  And bang, down go the towers and we're off to war.
[02:56:45.876 --> 02:56:50.538]  They needed something because the people were not falling for the global warming scam.
[02:56:50.538 --> 02:56:55.599]  There was too much exposed about their fake statistics and so on.
[02:56:55.599 --> 02:57:00.061]  They weren't going for those carbon taxes at the Copenhagen meeting.
[02:57:00.061 --> 02:57:03.142]  And so they needed something of a crisis to push it through.
[02:57:03.142 --> 02:57:05.563]  And bingo, you get this bill in the Gulf.
[02:57:05.563 --> 02:57:10.244]  And sure enough, they're using this as an excuse to start limiting energy and so on.
[02:57:10.244 --> 02:57:11.104]  They've just put £300
[02:57:13.101 --> 02:57:17.497]  Uh, extra, uh, taxes on every air flight going out of Britain.
[02:57:19.818 --> 02:57:26.383]  Yeah, how does a tax make up for that?
[02:57:26.383 --> 02:57:28.405]  I mean, how does a tax make up?
[02:57:28.405 --> 02:57:44.678]  And, of course, that was part of the Copenhagen Treaty, is this new global authority with carbon taxes on flights, and Obama is saying we've got to pass the carbon bill, you know, this tax will fix it, and then all the evidence is they've been blocking the relief, the people on the well were given orders by BP,
[02:57:45.999 --> 02:57:48.982]  That they said would cause this spill to happen?
[02:57:48.982 --> 02:57:52.606]  I mean, this is... More and more, they're doing everything in plain view.
[02:57:52.606 --> 02:58:07.921]  Why do you think we've had them come out and admit that the CIA is putting out fake bin Laden videos in the Washington Post, in the spy talk column, which is an official CIA... I mean, Washington Post is admittedly CIA-run, and that's the spy column about...
[02:58:08.582 --> 02:58:09.863]  Spooks every week.
[02:58:09.863 --> 02:58:11.203]  They admitted that there.
[02:58:11.203 --> 02:58:14.825]  They come right out on Fox and admit, yes, we grow the opium.
[02:58:14.825 --> 02:58:21.548]  Why, Alan, when we come back, are they just suddenly admitting everything?
[02:58:21.548 --> 02:58:23.429]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:26.671]  Alan Watt, hold next hour with us, final hour, and your phone calls.
[02:58:26.671 --> 02:58:32.073]  Dan, Al, Aaron, Monica, JD, about 15 minutes to the next hour, we'll start taking your phone calls.
[02:58:32.073 --> 02:58:35.895]  I talked to Jack McClam, Officer Jack McClam, just over the phone last segment.
[02:58:36.115 --> 02:58:37.698]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:37.698 --> 02:58:39.781]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.558 --> 02:58:55.101]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.101 --> 02:58:56.022]  Number 1.
[02:58:56.022 --> 02:58:59.445]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:59.445 --> 02:59:00.305]  Number 2.
[02:59:00.305 --> 02:59:05.189]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.189 --> 02:59:05.949]  It's true.
[02:59:05.949 --> 02:59:10.813]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:10.813 --> 02:59:11.634]  Number 3.
[02:59:11.634 --> 02:59:15.216]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.216 --> 02:59:18.919]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.119 --> 02:59:19.919]  Number 4.
[02:59:19.919 --> 02:59:22.680]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.680 --> 02:59:26.362]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.362 --> 02:59:27.142]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.142 --> 02:59:31.304]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.304 --> 02:59:36.346]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.346 --> 02:59:40.527]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.527 --> 02:59:42.308]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.308 --> 02:59:46.910]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:59:47.210 --> 02:59:47.310]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:47.310 --> 02:59:48.151]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:48.151 --> 02:59:49.371]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.202 --> 03:00:19.589]  Cardinemo's got a story up on Infowars.com and GCNlive.com.
[03:00:19.589 --> 03:00:21.670]  Iran attack moves forward.
[03:00:21.670 --> 03:00:23.052]  Iran permitted the U.S.
[03:00:23.052 --> 03:00:32.140]  and Israel to score a propaganda victory Monday when it refused to allow two International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors entry into the country for an inspection of its nuclear program.
[03:00:33.516 --> 03:00:40.761]  And it's now being used by the former head of Mossad to call for a preemptive strike with nukes on Iran.
[03:00:40.761 --> 03:00:43.222]  That's what the rest of the Israeli government's calling for.
[03:00:43.222 --> 03:00:44.163]  And a U.S.
[03:00:44.163 --> 03:00:46.804]  slash Israeli fleet is now off the coast of Iran.
[03:00:46.804 --> 03:00:51.948]  And Israeli papers are saying that they're preparing to start boarding Iranian ships.
[03:00:52.688 --> 03:00:55.291]  And stopping goods going into the country, which is an act of war.
[03:00:55.291 --> 03:00:59.095]  So this could flare up today, a week from now, or a year from now.
[03:00:59.095 --> 03:01:01.617]  But it's definitely on the front burner.
[03:01:01.617 --> 03:01:03.119]  And this is so serious.
[03:01:03.119 --> 03:01:06.502]  But going back to Alan Watt, we'll talk more about that throughout the hour.
[03:01:06.502 --> 03:01:08.104]  Our researcher, author, Alan Watt.
[03:01:08.864 --> 03:01:12.046]  Alan, I was asking you the question of why are they so out in the open now?
[03:01:12.046 --> 03:01:21.693]  I mean, they've really shifted from admitting things more and more a few years ago, but spinning it to just, yeah, the CIA fakes fake bin Laden videos in the Washington Post.
[03:01:21.693 --> 03:01:24.075]  Yeah, the government's growing the opium and shipping it in.
[03:01:24.075 --> 03:01:25.296]  What's the big deal?
[03:01:25.296 --> 03:01:28.618]  I mean, what is that tactic, Alan Watt?
[03:01:28.618 --> 03:01:30.960]  Part of it is a tactic of
[03:01:31.733 --> 03:01:35.037]  The creation of apathy within the general populace.
[03:01:35.037 --> 03:01:51.356]  When you're changing or shifting gears from one system to another, and you're destroying all the old, and you're increasing prices, you've got massive unemployment rates, all of that kind of stuff, you give them a kind of schizoid society, again, through all media.
[03:01:52.097 --> 03:01:54.920]  On the one hand, you turn on the television and things seem quite normal.
[03:01:54.920 --> 03:01:57.983]  There's your favorite old shows and everything's okay.
[03:01:57.983 --> 03:02:01.647]  And then you hear your schizophrenic news mixed with Hollywood and so on.
[03:02:01.647 --> 03:02:11.258]  So all the horror that you're seeing is the drones hit the wrong villages in Pakistan, kill people, is mixed up with the latest boob job and some Hollywood bimbo.
[03:02:11.878 --> 03:02:25.046]  Everything becomes surrealistic and at the same time they hammer you with a new system, ideas that subconsciously penetrate you that you're going into or you are into a new system and there's nothing you can do about it.
[03:02:25.046 --> 03:02:28.608]  It's a creation of apathy mixed up with surrealism.
[03:02:28.608 --> 03:02:36.672]  It's a scientific technique actually, intense, very advanced psychological warfare on a grand scale and it's done through repetition.
[03:02:36.672 --> 03:02:39.294]  We've been going through it for quite a few
[03:02:39.454 --> 03:02:42.537]  It's learned helplessness, it's confusing people.
[03:02:42.537 --> 03:03:03.017]  Never in an old tribal situation 5,000 years ago would you see happy bimbos cut into children dying and so it's not normal and so they're literally searing our neurons and programming us where we're a bunch of gibbering idiots and just can't even respond to real human activity as they reduce the language down where it's impossible now
[03:03:03.638 --> 03:03:09.982]  I mean, I see people at grocery stores, in the mall, in the street, even well-to-do people who literally cannot hold a conversation.
[03:03:09.982 --> 03:03:12.023]  I mean, they have been turned into suboid slaves.
[03:03:13.078 --> 03:03:13.659]  They have.
[03:03:13.659 --> 03:03:19.202]  It's linguistic minimalism, so you cannot express ideas of even frustration.
[03:03:19.202 --> 03:03:21.524]  Never mind, let's get ready for a revolution.
[03:03:21.524 --> 03:03:24.646]  And Orwell went through that whole technique very well indeed.
[03:03:24.646 --> 03:03:33.292]  You cannot express a thought to another person, or a coherent idea or plan, and therefore nothing can come against those who are ruling you.
[03:03:33.292 --> 03:03:40.357]  It's very advanced psychological warfare, but Bertrand Russell and others said we have to create apathy amongst the public during this phase.
[03:03:40.897 --> 03:03:44.780]  That's what you've got, to an extent, as a form of apathy.
[03:03:44.780 --> 03:03:46.281]  It makes people feel powerless.
[03:03:46.281 --> 03:03:49.182]  What can you do is the only thing that they can possibly say.
[03:03:49.182 --> 03:03:49.903]  What can you do?
[03:03:49.903 --> 03:03:51.464]  Oh, well.
[03:03:51.464 --> 03:04:02.210]  And everyone, again, is tied into a system, as we're trained to, like little animals, to work for this thing called money that keeps becoming more diluted, like water.
[03:04:03.471 --> 03:04:03.932]  I don't
[03:04:20.487 --> 03:04:21.707]  That's right, that's the secret.
[03:04:21.707 --> 03:04:37.150]  They get you roped into the casino, they get you roped into Wall Street, they get you roped into the pension, roped into Social Security, roped into the system, on your smaller and smaller island, like Howard Beale says, just leave us alone in our living rooms.
[03:04:37.150 --> 03:04:40.951]  Let me have my toaster and my steel-belted radials, and I'll leave you alone.
[03:04:40.951 --> 03:04:42.771]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone!
[03:04:42.771 --> 03:04:43.932]  I'm a human being!
[03:04:43.932 --> 03:04:45.252]  My life has value!
[03:04:46.292 --> 03:04:47.934]  I don't know what all the answers are.
[03:04:47.934 --> 03:04:49.476]  I just know first you've got to get mad.
[03:04:49.476 --> 03:04:50.918]  You've got to break your conditioning.
[03:04:50.918 --> 03:04:56.325]  You've got to see how they've incrementally lowered us into this morass of evil and dehumanization.
[03:04:56.325 --> 03:04:59.088]  You've got to break your conditioning and awaken out of it.
[03:04:59.088 --> 03:04:59.529]  Stay with us!
[03:05:04.884 --> 03:05:06.145]  Tyranny is here.
[03:05:06.145 --> 03:05:09.809]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:05:09.809 --> 03:05:12.311]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:05:12.311 --> 03:05:18.176]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:05:18.176 --> 03:05:24.422]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:05:24.842 --> 03:05:30.786]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:05:30.786 --> 03:05:34.989]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:05:34.989 --> 03:05:39.292]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:05:39.292 --> 03:05:45.237]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:05:45.237 --> 03:05:48.799]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:05:48.799 --> 03:05:50.780]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:05:50.780 --> 03:05:51.221]  It's here.

[03:06:01.206 --> 03:06:04.229]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.229 --> 03:06:09.554]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.554 --> 03:06:11.596]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.596 --> 03:06:16.600]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.600 --> 03:06:17.781]  How much do you want?
[03:06:17.781 --> 03:06:18.902]  When do you want it?
[03:06:18.902 --> 03:06:20.804]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:20.804 --> 03:06:21.865]  When will you need it?
[03:06:21.865 --> 03:06:23.887]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.087 --> 03:06:25.388]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.388 --> 03:06:26.928]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:26.928 --> 03:06:32.191]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.191 --> 03:06:35.772]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:35.772 --> 03:06:39.234]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.594 --> 03:06:40.815]  How much will you need?
[03:06:40.815 --> 03:06:41.716]  We don't know.
[03:06:41.716 --> 03:06:42.816]  How much do you want?

[03:08:04.454 --> 03:08:07.774]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:33.471 --> 03:08:36.293]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[03:08:36.293 --> 03:08:39.135]  Again, thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:08:39.135 --> 03:08:42.457]  Alan Watt, author, researcher, is our guest.
[03:08:42.457 --> 03:08:44.398]  CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com is his website.
[03:08:44.398 --> 03:08:47.680]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:08:47.680 --> 03:08:51.423]  We were discussing before the break the mind control.
[03:08:51.423 --> 03:08:57.627]  The way that they have Geraldo Rivera with the Marine Corps Colonel admitting that our forces helped grow the opium.
[03:08:58.875 --> 03:09:08.018]  And CIA aircraft are constantly caught with cocaine and heroin on board, and it's an open secret, and came out in congressional hearings, the government ships the drugs in.
[03:09:08.018 --> 03:09:14.420]  But now they just come out and admit they're growing it, and they come out and admit the CIA's putting out fake bin Laden videos.
[03:09:14.420 --> 03:09:20.502]  And they use the exact same replay of propaganda about Iran having nukes, just like Iraq supposedly did.
[03:09:21.735 --> 03:09:32.503]  And it comes out that Rahm Emanuel in mainstream NBC was getting kickbacks with Blagojevich and that BP was paying illegally for his apartment.
[03:09:32.503 --> 03:09:34.965]  And no one gets in trouble!
[03:09:34.965 --> 03:09:41.130]  And it's just setting the precedent that yes, it's just like a pimp breaks a prostitute.
[03:09:41.130 --> 03:09:43.071]  He gets her, he beats her up.
[03:09:43.071 --> 03:09:46.394]  They have that HBO special about pimps and they say, what do you pay your whores?
[03:09:46.394 --> 03:09:48.476]  I pay her nothing.
[03:09:48.476 --> 03:09:49.136]  And she likes it.
[03:09:49.136 --> 03:09:51.318]  Maybe I'll give her some fried chicken every once in a while.
[03:09:52.748 --> 03:10:15.205]  And there was a case we talked about in that same documentary where the prostitute's been hit by a car, she's almost dead, and her mother's there, going, oh my baby, my baby, and the pimp comes in all arrogantly, and she says, oh baby, I'm gonna get back up for you, I'm gonna get back off the, out of this, out of this bed, I'm gonna make you that money, baby, I'm gonna do everything I can for you, and he's like, that's right, you better!
[03:10:16.212 --> 03:10:18.456]  And the woman just grovels.
[03:10:18.456 --> 03:10:23.465]  And I don't know what it is about the psyche, but many women, you know, they like the bad guy in high school.
[03:10:25.148 --> 03:10:33.672]  I didn't know to a certain extent I was seen as the bad guy, but the point is, is that, is that, but I mean, really the bad guy.
[03:10:33.672 --> 03:10:43.758]  And there's an expanded significance to that today, where there's just a, yeah, we took trillions, Congress, the Federal Reserve says, we're not going to tell you where it is.
[03:10:43.758 --> 03:10:50.661]  And it comes out in the Chicago Tribune that DynCorp and Halliburton have been caught running giant child kidnapping rings, and nobody gets in trouble.
[03:10:50.661 --> 03:10:53.042]  And it comes out that all of this is happening.
[03:10:56.007 --> 03:11:01.170]  It's part of getting the public used to a form of lawlessness across the board in society.
[03:11:01.170 --> 03:11:03.771]  It's easier to control society in a feudalistic fashion.
[03:11:18.423 --> 03:11:34.689]  Um, when the big boys come in with the black goons, the black fat goons and soldiers, um, it's easy to control them when they're already living in a apparently a corrupt society where you give payoffs for everything and anything that you actually need even to basically survive day to day.
[03:11:35.642 --> 03:11:41.668]  In other words, there's no law and order on the bottom level, technically, and society itself becomes corrupted.
[03:11:41.668 --> 03:11:43.750]  They have to become corrupted to survive.
[03:11:43.750 --> 03:11:51.717]  And as corrupt globalists, their carbon taxes that they admit will be on families, won't be allowed to live in a home by themselves, everything will be dormitories.
[03:11:52.518 --> 03:11:53.840]  They'll be a one-child policy.
[03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:55.422]  They're now announcing it.
[03:11:55.422 --> 03:12:01.829]  If you can have a factory, a business, a job, everything is up to government and then it can selectively enforce it.
[03:12:01.829 --> 03:12:06.114]  And then it's the new superclass where, hey honey, you want to be able to have a job?
[03:12:06.114 --> 03:12:08.456]  You want to be able to have a hamburger stand?
[03:12:08.456 --> 03:12:09.418]  You look pretty good.
[03:12:09.418 --> 03:12:11.520]  You've got to serve my troops.
[03:12:11.520 --> 03:12:12.922]  This is what bondage means.
[03:12:13.931 --> 03:12:20.076]  It does, and also, as I say, they need this Gulf tragedy to bring in the carbon taxes.
[03:12:20.076 --> 03:12:23.858]  They've already been trading them, as I say, for four or five years in the EU.
[03:12:23.858 --> 03:12:31.204]  The European Parliament gave out millions of dollars, or euros worth, of free carbon credits for them to trade.
[03:12:31.204 --> 03:12:34.046]  They're already making profits off them.
[03:12:34.046 --> 03:12:39.510]  Lord Rothschild's, with Al Gore, his bank in Switzerland has been agreed
[03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:43.173]  That's where all the carbon taxes for the entire world has to go through.
[03:12:43.173 --> 03:12:45.154]  They're not going to back off, you understand.
[03:12:45.154 --> 03:12:48.717]  I've set this up for the last few years, and everything counts on it.
[03:12:48.717 --> 03:12:59.965]  So they need to... and they will make whatever it takes to happen, to get it ran through until we're living in utter poverty and paying all... See, it's also a substitute, too, for consumerism.
[03:13:00.723 --> 03:13:12.458]  You'll find that everything that you earn will be getting paid back in fees and taxes, and there'll be very little left to live on at the bottom, and that's a substitute for a consumerist society.
[03:13:12.458 --> 03:13:14.521]  That's definitely part of their agenda.
[03:13:16.451 --> 03:13:21.054]  And they admit that that's their agenda, is to bankrupt everyone.
[03:13:21.054 --> 03:13:39.787]  But the good news is, as you said, their carbon tax is in trouble, their wars are in trouble, their agenda on every front is in trouble, and that's why the FCC in the US has now announced the Australian-style plan, a black box in the home that both spies on you and regulates what you can watch.
[03:13:39.787 --> 03:13:46.091]  I didn't even expect for them to come out this bold, this early, and actually have it in newspapers in the US.
[03:13:47.712 --> 03:14:05.681]  Almost as an aside, yeah, we're going to track everything you're doing, and yeah, Google's driving around for the NSA, listening to everything you do illegally, and that's just the way it is, and yeah, we're going to start shutting down freedom of speech in America, and yeah, we're going to bring the Fairness Doctrine back to talk radio.
[03:14:05.681 --> 03:14:06.841]  They are really desperate.
[03:14:06.841 --> 03:14:07.642]  This shows
[03:14:08.402 --> 03:14:11.263]  Because from what I've studied, they believe we wouldn't wake up this much.
[03:14:11.263 --> 03:14:20.785]  They believe they could use the web, that we'd only care about LeBron James and football and basketball and Tiger Woods, and we wouldn't use the web as a tool against them.
[03:14:20.785 --> 03:14:27.347]  Now they see that we have used it, and as Jay Rockefeller said in his Senate hearing, we would have been better never inventing the Internet.
[03:14:27.347 --> 03:14:34.629]  So they've clearly made the decision to start shutting it off, and it appears they're going with a bold, quick way to do it.
[03:14:34.629 --> 03:14:37.510]  I don't see that going well for them, Alan.
[03:14:38.576 --> 03:14:39.760]  It depends.
[03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:41.465]  It hangs really on the U.S.
[03:14:41.465 --> 03:14:42.770]  Most countries have gone through.
[03:14:43.792 --> 03:14:47.894]  Generations of financial depression, like Britain for instance.
[03:14:47.894 --> 03:14:51.396]  Also, they've been overrun by immigrants by design.
[03:14:51.396 --> 03:15:06.983]  Tony Blair's aide admitted that in the newspapers, that Tony Blair said that he was when he opened the gates of immigration so wide in Britain, with the most diverse cultures, that any semblance of a British identity would be lost and could never be regained forever.
[03:15:06.983 --> 03:15:08.203]  That has happened there.
[03:15:08.203 --> 03:15:09.444]  So people are apathetic
[03:15:10.064 --> 03:15:18.828]  Many of the immigrants came from countries where there is no democracy as such and they accept a new totalitarian regime where you do what you're told quite naturally.
[03:15:18.828 --> 03:15:21.149]  That's what they're trying to do in the States as well right now.
[03:15:21.149 --> 03:15:32.194]  So it depends on how many people within the United States still has enough gumption to stand up and literally by any and all means say, no we're not going to be your servants and your serfs.
[03:15:32.915 --> 03:15:35.919]  Uh, and, uh, and do something about it.
[03:15:35.919 --> 03:15:37.241]  It's coming down to that.
[03:15:37.241 --> 03:15:48.958]  If it doesn't happen, um, then you will go into an even more apathetic state as everyone escapes to get by, to live and survive, and people become more afraid to even speak about anything that's happening.
[03:15:50.253 --> 03:15:51.734]  Well here's an example of that.
[03:15:51.734 --> 03:15:56.057]  The New York Daily News is reporting what sheriffs have told us for five years.
[03:15:56.057 --> 03:16:02.182]  Mexican drug cartels threaten to harm US police officers who bust drug shipments while off duty.
[03:16:02.182 --> 03:16:04.544]  They're already killing cops all over.
[03:16:04.544 --> 03:16:08.667]  And so we knew five years ago from our sources in the DEA and others
[03:16:09.147 --> 03:16:27.903]  That they were training Los Zetas to start killing American cops, and that the New World Order was going to use Mexican muscle to start running mafia tactics, and because there's the language barrier, the average American would allow this to creep up on them, and now this has been done, and here it is in the New York Daily News.
[03:16:27.903 --> 03:16:31.666]  I mean, we are really going under a total mafia government.
[03:16:33.095 --> 03:16:35.598]  Yeah, and it is a style like that.
[03:16:35.598 --> 03:16:48.553]  You also have a terrible problem, too, as society gets more and more degraded and they lose their morality, they lose their ability to have a common idea of the rights and wrongs within that society.
[03:16:48.553 --> 03:16:52.438]  You have a massive problem with cops on the take in all the big cities.
[03:16:54.279 --> 03:16:57.261]  But if you won't take the take, they threaten to kill your family.
[03:16:57.261 --> 03:17:03.165]  And the feds are covering this up and funded this.
[03:17:03.165 --> 03:17:05.327]  The CIA is running this.
[03:17:05.327 --> 03:17:06.808]  This is the death of America.
[03:17:08.173 --> 03:17:09.674]  It is, actually, it is.
[03:17:09.674 --> 03:17:11.756]  And as I say, the U.S.
[03:17:11.756 --> 03:17:19.742]  is the only country left, in fact, the only country that had an idea of personal freedoms and liberties and so on.
[03:17:19.742 --> 03:17:21.023]  No other countries had that.
[03:17:21.023 --> 03:17:24.166]  So it all hinges on what happens within America.
[03:17:24.166 --> 03:17:27.068]  If they succumb to it quietly, then it's all over.
[03:17:27.068 --> 03:17:34.894]  If they make a real ruckus about it and become very adamant and staunch and firm,
[03:17:35.658 --> 03:17:36.178]  I think so.
[03:18:02.417 --> 03:18:11.840]  They've announced that under the carbon tax, no matter how much money you've got, you're going to have to have the ration cards, and then the black market controlled by the government.
[03:18:11.840 --> 03:18:24.685]  I mean, it is just racket on top of racket on top of racket with the set goal of bankrupting everyone, and then they just feed us the culture-killing sludge that's on TV to turn us all into monkeys.
[03:18:25.518 --> 03:18:32.980]  Yes, and also too, and this rationing is coming along, they already have a form of this for the wealthy elite themselves and those who get into politics.
[03:18:32.980 --> 03:18:43.904]  You get access to the true natural food and organically grown food that doesn't even come in contact with the sprayed skies, the chemtrails.
[03:18:43.904 --> 03:18:49.225]  They get access to this and so the goody two-shoes ones will get access to the better rationing.
[03:18:49.225 --> 03:18:54.347]  The rest of us will die off with the Monsanto GMO and heavily toxically sprayed stuff.
[03:18:54.907 --> 03:19:00.235]  So that's part of the agenda, is to take down society and the numbers within our societies.
[03:19:01.741 --> 03:19:28.194]  And then meanwhile, every day, new major government, industry, university, medical center reports, every GMO food has the side effect, no that's the main effect, of sterilizing, hurting the rats within three generations, they're totally sterile, hair growing out of their mouths, deformed, we see fetal birth weights way down, fetal birth rates are way up in the United States,
[03:19:30.293 --> 03:19:32.194]  The honeybees are dying from it.
[03:19:32.194 --> 03:19:33.994]  It's working like a charm.
[03:19:33.994 --> 03:19:38.176]  I mean, this is the most psychopathic nightmare system.
[03:19:38.176 --> 03:19:53.422]  And the public's defenseless because all they care about is football, baseball, Hollywood gossip, and drinking their sodium fluoride, and those of us that are awake are being listed as terrorists, and the borders are imploding.
[03:19:53.422 --> 03:19:56.083]  I mean, it is just... And now they're getting ready for World War III.
[03:19:56.083 --> 03:19:57.864]  Your phone call's coming up next with Alan Watts.
[03:19:57.864 --> 03:19:58.244]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.949 --> 03:20:04.973]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:20:04.973 --> 03:20:10.300]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:20:10.300 --> 03:20:12.362]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:20:12.362 --> 03:20:17.108]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:20:17.108 --> 03:20:17.468]  I think?
[03:20:35.293 --> 03:20:35.613]  Good to go!
[03:21:01.883 --> 03:21:05.568]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:21:18.817 --> 03:21:25.483]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:21:25.483 --> 03:21:31.468]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:21:31.468 --> 03:21:35.651]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:21:35.651 --> 03:21:39.935]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:49.423]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:21:49.423 --> 03:21:51.404]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:21:51.404 --> 03:21:52.525]  It's here.

[03:22:09.105 --> 03:22:13.306]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:22:13.306 --> 03:22:15.227]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:22:15.227 --> 03:22:17.668]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:22:17.668 --> 03:22:24.971]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every

[03:22:56.787 --> 03:22:57.228]  Don't answer it!
[03:23:02.483 --> 03:23:10.588]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[03:23:10.588 --> 03:23:12.069]  800-477-9256.
[03:23:12.069 --> 03:23:18.412]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:23:18.412 --> 03:23:22.695]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:23:22.695 --> 03:23:27.658]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan,
[03:23:27.858 --> 03:23:28.338]  We're good to go.
[03:23:53.046 --> 03:23:54.747]  800-477-9256.
[03:23:54.747 --> 03:23:56.207]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:23:56.207 --> 03:24:07.711]  Daddy, I'm cold!
[03:24:07.711 --> 03:24:12.092]  There once was a land where the people were very, very free.
[03:24:12.092 --> 03:24:15.933]  Energy was cheap, and prosperity filled the land.
[03:24:15.933 --> 03:24:20.635]  This made some grown-ups very angry, and they wanted to take away our freedoms.
[03:24:21.656 --> 03:24:31.041]  So they created a mythical crisis saying, CO2 was bad, even though CO2 is what we breathe and it makes the plants grow.
[03:24:31.041 --> 03:24:35.142]  In fact, nothing would be green without CO2.
[03:24:35.142 --> 03:24:40.845]  And they scared all the children by saying that people doing ordinary things were killing the planet.
[03:24:40.845 --> 03:24:50.530]  So they passed a very nasty bill called Cap and Trade, so they could tax us for everything we do, like keeping our houses warm and driving cars.
[03:24:51.866 --> 03:24:55.153]  And that's why we can't afford to keep the house any warmer, honey.
[03:24:55.153 --> 03:24:59.061]  Why did they do all this, Daddy?
[03:24:59.061 --> 03:25:00.625]  To stop global warming, honey.
[03:25:04.209 --> 03:25:06.952]  But they really did it because they want to kill that little girl.
[03:25:06.952 --> 03:25:09.414]  They don't want her to be born in their own words.
[03:25:09.414 --> 03:25:11.115]  This is eugenics.
[03:25:11.115 --> 03:25:13.177]  This is about the globalists controlling society.
[03:25:13.177 --> 03:25:26.429]  Some folks took a government-paid-for, high-budget ad that says that bunny rabbits and dogs will drown and die, that they air in Australia, and they made a spoof of what it really means.
[03:25:26.429 --> 03:25:26.970]  Alan what?
[03:25:28.453 --> 03:25:34.574]  Again, you understand that this is an incremental scientific dictatorship in their own words, but a lot of times you're a bit pessimistic.
[03:25:34.574 --> 03:25:38.855]  Speaking of solutions before we go to calls, I do see us having a fighting chance.
[03:25:38.855 --> 03:25:54.799]  I mean, I really am seeing a massive awakening happening right now, and I think that's why Zbigniew Brzezinski, as you know, about five weeks ago gave a speech to the CFR in Canada, where you live, and basically said for the first time in history the whole world is awake to us and our world government's in trouble.
[03:25:55.560 --> 03:25:57.203]  And that's what their internal documents show.
[03:25:57.203 --> 03:25:59.449]  I mean, I don't think they're invincible.
[03:25:59.449 --> 03:26:00.892]  What do you think?
[03:26:00.892 --> 03:26:02.135]  They're not invincible.
[03:26:02.135 --> 03:26:03.257]  It's the will of the people.
[03:26:04.357 --> 03:26:05.959]  It's at stake here.
[03:26:05.959 --> 03:26:14.445]  And the problem is, and this is what they've discussed at the top themselves in their own books, they work everything under a warfare strategy.
[03:26:14.445 --> 03:26:22.871]  And they've said that if those who are still making enough money to get by and so on, if they are making enough money, they will not join the rest at the bottom.
[03:26:22.871 --> 03:26:29.376]  So they're hoping to really segregate society from the haves and the have-nots as they push it further and further.
[03:26:29.776 --> 03:26:30.316]  We're good to go.
[03:26:50.143 --> 03:27:01.882]  And then the poor will become more vicious and start attacking the middle class, so the middle class will instinctively then kind of team up with the elite, at least in their own minds, when it's the elite that orchestrated the entire program to begin with.
[03:27:02.472 --> 03:27:03.333]  That's right.
[03:27:03.333 --> 03:27:20.550]  And what has to happen is, therefore, is that everyone has to have a quick education that it doesn't matter what class you think you belong to and how well you think that you're doing at the moment, they're going to take the whole system down gradually until you're all serfs and they get it wrong to everybody in the end.
[03:27:21.130 --> 03:27:24.953]  Because there's to be no middle class whatsoever left after this agenda's through.
[03:27:24.953 --> 03:27:31.858]  They've said that in all the writings from Karl Marx right up through the whole issue of international affairs, no middle class will be allowed.
[03:27:31.858 --> 03:27:38.202]  This new scientific society, the only replacement for a middle class will be a scientific elite.
[03:27:38.202 --> 03:27:39.383]  And that's what we have already.
[03:27:39.383 --> 03:27:43.206]  Look who Obama's appointed on all these different panels.
[03:27:43.206 --> 03:27:45.588]  There's more appointees than any previous government.
[03:27:49.251 --> 03:27:57.537]  Oh, there's never been an administration this packed.
[03:27:57.537 --> 03:28:04.482]  I mean, they're all saying no Second Amendment, global extermination, one-child policies, eugenics, no free speech.
[03:28:04.482 --> 03:28:07.785]  I mean, they're in a group of authoritarian, goblin-like
[03:28:08.385 --> 03:28:13.109]  Pot-bellied, jowled, little, human-hating trash!
[03:28:13.109 --> 03:28:13.730]  Mm-hmm.
[03:28:13.730 --> 03:28:14.851]  And also what the U.S.
[03:28:14.851 --> 03:28:23.878]  and everybody else has to do is to kick off all these people, all these appointees, all these NGO groups that are now appointed to governments.
[03:28:23.878 --> 03:28:25.260]  We did not elect them.
[03:28:25.260 --> 03:28:28.182]  They have no say over our lives.
[03:28:28.182 --> 03:28:31.945]  And therefore they have to be kicked out completely, and government has to be taught.
[03:28:31.945 --> 03:28:33.086]  And you know this, Alex.
[03:28:33.086 --> 03:28:34.968]  Government's going to, one way or another,
[03:28:36.118 --> 03:28:42.861]  One way or another, government has to be taught, re-taught, that they serve the people.
[03:28:42.861 --> 03:28:44.902]  Well, notice it's not public servant.
[03:28:44.902 --> 03:28:46.022]  It's official.
[03:28:46.022 --> 03:28:47.123]  It's authority.
[03:28:47.123 --> 03:28:57.927]  And the media cremally calls them officials and bows down to them and gets the government press releases and with relish repeats the lies and bows to government.
[03:28:57.927 --> 03:29:00.148]  Everything's the opposite of what liberty is.
[03:29:00.148 --> 03:29:04.810]  Just bowing and groveling to the petty signants of power.
[03:29:04.810 --> 03:29:05.170]  That's right.
[03:29:06.276 --> 03:29:14.839]  It's a strange society where the public servants earn more than maybe a thousand families combined each.
[03:29:14.839 --> 03:29:17.000]  So there's something wrong here.
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:18.761]  And let's get back to serving the people.
[03:29:18.761 --> 03:29:23.042]  They've never served the people in other countries in the US.
[03:29:23.042 --> 03:29:24.723]  You're the only country with a chance.
[03:29:25.604 --> 03:29:28.626]  And I think people have to regain that very, very quickly.
[03:29:28.626 --> 03:29:31.368]  And as I say, by one means or another, because we know the agenda.
[03:29:31.368 --> 03:29:32.809]  They've told us the agenda.
[03:29:32.809 --> 03:29:33.650]  They know what's in store.
[03:29:33.650 --> 03:29:36.091]  Yeah, they're already poisoning the food, the water.
[03:29:36.091 --> 03:29:40.654]  Most of us are dead already with the soft kill weapons.
[03:29:40.654 --> 03:29:41.475]  Stay there, Ellen Want.
[03:29:41.475 --> 03:29:43.176]  We're going directly to calls when we come back.
[03:29:43.176 --> 03:29:47.699]  Key information straight ahead.

[03:29:51.582 --> 03:29:52.983]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.983 --> 03:29:54.484]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.483 --> 03:29:58.171]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:31:00.569 --> 03:31:02.891]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:02.891 --> 03:31:05.153]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:05.153 --> 03:31:08.475]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:08.475 --> 03:31:13.599]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:13.599 --> 03:31:18.123]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:18.123 --> 03:31:20.465]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:20.465 --> 03:31:23.007]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:23.007 --> 03:31:25.849]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:26.249 --> 03:31:33.868]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:34.184 --> 03:31:39.587]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:39.587 --> 03:31:42.429]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:42.429 --> 03:31:46.111]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:46.111 --> 03:31:47.192]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:47.192 --> 03:31:48.533]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:48.533 --> 03:31:50.034]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:53.865 --> 03:32:54.325]  Thank you!
[03:33:07.114 --> 03:33:15.784]  Alright, we're going back to Alan Watt here in just a minute.
[03:33:15.784 --> 03:33:20.289]  By the way, everything we're talking about is in hundreds of government textbooks, policy reports.
[03:33:21.297 --> 03:33:35.264]  That's the frustration, is the globalists said a hundred years ago they were going to build a global socialist system to bankrupt everyone and make us all dependent on a scientific elite to then carry out the eugenics extermination of the general public.
[03:33:35.264 --> 03:33:38.786]  And that's what they're going to do, and they're already poisoning you in the food and water.
[03:33:38.786 --> 03:33:43.769]  Some people send me emails and say, we live longer than we did a hundred years ago.
[03:33:43.769 --> 03:33:45.750]  Depending on the period, around 30%, sometimes even higher, 50%,
[03:33:48.738 --> 03:33:54.740]  I mean, in between those gradients, people died by the age of five to six to seven.
[03:33:54.740 --> 03:33:57.442]  A lot of kids died in the first six months.
[03:33:57.442 --> 03:33:59.622]  You had a lot of infant mortality.
[03:33:59.622 --> 03:34:04.904]  So they averaged that in and say, oh, the average person lived to be, say, 43 years old in 1860.
[03:34:06.616 --> 03:34:07.497]  Well, that's not true.
[03:34:07.497 --> 03:34:12.842]  If you made it past the age of 10, the average person lived into their early 80s.
[03:34:12.842 --> 03:34:27.174]  And if you look at infant mortality, they now admit that America has the lowest infant mortality, that is the highest rate of children dying, the highest infant mortality in the world, of any industrialized world, country.
[03:34:27.174 --> 03:34:33.420]  And I'm trying to hurry here, and I start babbling whenever I do that, because I've got Alan Watt in your calls, but let me just take my time on this for a moment.
[03:34:35.077 --> 03:34:39.959]  There's different statistics from each year gleaned in different counties and cities.
[03:34:39.959 --> 03:34:44.462]  And they've gone back and looked at this, but here's a layman's way of explaining it.
[03:34:44.462 --> 03:34:48.404]  We have family cemeteries in East Texas that we visited.
[03:34:48.404 --> 03:34:53.046]  And you will see Jones, Johnsons, Browns, depending on what cemetery we're visiting.
[03:34:53.046 --> 03:34:58.249]  And 30% or more, you know, every two or three graves, it's a
[03:35:00.017 --> 03:35:00.558]  We're good to go.
[03:35:15.540 --> 03:35:18.162]  Their life expectancy is going way down.
[03:35:18.162 --> 03:35:19.623]  The United States is going way down.
[03:35:19.623 --> 03:35:20.703]  We are being poisoned.
[03:35:20.703 --> 03:35:21.524]  We are being killed.
[03:35:21.524 --> 03:35:22.424]  This is happening.
[03:35:22.424 --> 03:35:23.605]  So I'm done talking about that.
[03:35:23.605 --> 03:35:28.708]  I'm going to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio broadcast possible.
[03:35:28.708 --> 03:35:32.811]  And then we'll go back to Alan Watt and directly to the callers that are holding.
[03:35:34.013 --> 03:35:35.914]  One of them is Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:35:35.914 --> 03:35:45.781]  Inner Health Botanicals, a fantastic company that's been supporting us for years, have been providing products for the past five years that give you the perfect solution to keeping your body healthy.
[03:35:45.781 --> 03:35:47.242]  It's a superfood, folks.
[03:35:47.242 --> 03:35:53.325]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you energy and keeps you well.
[03:35:53.325 --> 03:35:57.788]  It even won the best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:35:57.788 --> 03:36:02.671]  Try their Nutri-Cafe Amazing Organic Coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:36:03.792 --> 03:36:07.533]  Now that something that you don't see on store shelves every day.

[03:36:40.604 --> 03:36:51.867]  Four new t-shirts, and one of them is an American flag, and the stripes are barbed wire, and it says Legalize Freedom Infowars.com.
[03:36:51.867 --> 03:36:53.447]  Great way to start conversations.
[03:36:53.447 --> 03:36:57.308]  Another is In the Fed, Restore the Republic.
[03:37:01.146 --> 03:37:03.947]  Another one is, don't tread on me, healthcare.
[03:37:03.947 --> 03:37:07.908]  And on the back it says, end Obamacare.
[03:37:07.908 --> 03:37:12.390]  We kind of thought we'd bastardize the name of Obama, Obamacare.
[03:37:12.390 --> 03:37:15.231]  Obamanoid, Barry Sotero, whatever you want to say.
[03:37:15.231 --> 03:37:17.171]  Yeah, there's that one, Infowars.com.
[03:37:17.171 --> 03:37:22.173]  And on the back, no it's not a typo, ladies and gentlemen, it really says Obamacare.
[03:37:22.173 --> 03:37:23.733]  Because he's a bum.
[03:37:23.733 --> 03:37:25.874]  That's right, repeal Obamacare.
[03:37:26.854 --> 03:37:32.437]  And of course, in the Fed, save the Republic, InfoWars.com.
[03:37:32.437 --> 03:37:40.000]  So those four new shirts available at InfoWars.com and your purchase of the shirts and the books and the videos makes the broadcast possible.

[03:38:13.010 --> 03:38:13.871]  And your phone calls.
[03:38:13.871 --> 03:38:28.462]  Alan, I want to go to these calls, but then at the last few minutes of the show, any other points that you think are important that are on the front burner in Alan Watt's interesting and informative world, and closing out the broadcast.
[03:38:28.462 --> 03:38:31.345]  But right now, let's go to Dan in Colorado.
[03:38:31.345 --> 03:38:32.185]  Dan, you're on the air.
[03:38:32.185 --> 03:38:32.706]  Thanks for holding.
[03:38:33.860 --> 03:38:36.961]  Hi Alex, I'm a long time listener, first time caller.
[03:38:36.961 --> 03:38:38.902]  I've been listening to you for about seven years.
[03:38:38.902 --> 03:38:42.563]  I hope you'll give me a minute here to go ahead and try to correct a wrong.
[03:38:42.563 --> 03:38:53.787]  I believe you're a phenomenal person that has a great amount of knowledge, but one thing you said today that just bothered me so bad, it was worth waiting the hour and 20 minutes to be able to say something.
[03:38:53.787 --> 03:38:58.929]  This business about the Catholic clergy not allowing men to be married, for most men having sex with men,
[03:38:59.589 --> 03:39:06.113]  I mean, let me be clear, I'm not involved in Catholic bashing here, and I get criticized because I don't Catholic bash.
[03:39:06.113 --> 03:39:08.274]  It's a very popular thing to do, and the media promotes it.
[03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:34.355]  I know there's been debates in the Catholic Church, and just from my study of different navies and other groups, it seems to me you get a bunch of men together and they can't ever be with a woman, that you're statistically going to have some problems there.
[03:39:34.355 --> 03:39:39.902]  But I was taking calls, I understand you've been holding before Alan Watt, but people just obsess over this stuff.
[03:39:40.282 --> 03:39:49.289]  The lady called in and says something about the Catholic Church, so I just threw in there that there is epidemic levels of child molestation going on all over the place.
[03:39:49.289 --> 03:39:55.813]  We talk about Congress and these congressmen and how in powerful positions this is going on everywhere.
[03:39:55.813 --> 03:39:57.595]  And I don't think that can be denied, Dan.
[03:39:58.689 --> 03:40:00.371]  Alex, are you going to allow me to speak?
[03:40:00.371 --> 03:40:01.492]  Well, I mean, you're on the air, sir.
[03:40:01.492 --> 03:40:02.893]  I just responded.
[03:40:02.893 --> 03:40:03.613]  You had a chance.
[03:40:03.613 --> 03:40:05.215]  Hold on, I'll put him on hold.
[03:40:05.215 --> 03:40:24.572]  You just allowed me, I mean, I allowed you to make your statement, which was a whole thought, and then I countered, and it seemed it made you really mad that I came back with my point about how child molestation is epidemic in power systems, and I'm going to get Alan Watts' take on that in a moment, but go ahead, Dan.
[03:40:25.273 --> 03:40:28.116]  Or you can respect me enough to go ahead and want me to purchase your product.
[03:40:47.236 --> 03:40:47.616]  I don't know.
[03:41:03.951 --> 03:41:06.292]  I'm enraged because you're talking over me.
[03:41:06.292 --> 03:41:08.693]  That's why I'm enraged to interrupt.
[03:41:08.693 --> 03:41:09.694]  Okay, put him on hold again.
[03:41:09.694 --> 03:41:10.834]  We're going to continue this.
[03:41:10.834 --> 03:41:12.595]  We're going to continue this, Dan.
[03:41:12.595 --> 03:41:15.016]  This is how, this is how this works.
[03:41:15.016 --> 03:41:20.759]  See, I don't sit there like these old fogey radio shows that nobody listens to where one guy talks for an hour and nobody interjects.
[03:41:20.759 --> 03:41:22.520]  People like hearing back and forth.
[03:41:22.520 --> 03:41:25.121]  That's normal unless you've got, you know, Alzheimer's.
[03:41:25.121 --> 03:41:30.904]  What I'm saying to you, sir, is that you made your counterpoint to me
[03:41:32.504 --> 03:41:36.407]  And then I made my counterpoint back and you're calling that an interruption.
[03:41:36.407 --> 03:41:42.171]  I'm going to give you one more chance to not repeat that I'm interrupting and tell me your view.
[03:41:42.171 --> 03:41:44.072]  My view is you've got it all wrong.
[03:41:44.072 --> 03:41:55.439]  If you don't know who Bella Dot is, a real school of darkness, a Catholic communist agent, the one that infiltrated the Catholic Church with over 1,000 men, also testified in front of Congress, put her back in the 30s and the 40s.
[03:41:55.439 --> 03:41:59.462]  If you don't know about that, you don't know what's going on as far as the battle within the Catholic Church.
[03:42:00.923 --> 03:42:04.644]  Sir, I'm not a Catholic, so I don't know a lot about it.
[03:42:04.644 --> 03:42:05.645]  I've got Catholic friends.
[03:42:05.645 --> 03:42:10.527]  They seem like good people that are out there, you know, standing up against abortion and things.
[03:42:10.527 --> 03:42:12.748]  Catholics are some of the best people I've met.
[03:42:12.748 --> 03:42:15.949]  My whole thing is I'm non-partisan, I'm non-denominational.
[03:42:15.949 --> 03:42:18.390]  I don't weigh in to all these religious infighting.
[03:42:18.390 --> 03:42:21.792]  That's a tool of the globalists, and I do know that they
[03:42:22.692 --> 03:42:27.696]  That the communists and others said they would infiltrate all of the clergy to take them over and corrupt them.
[03:42:27.696 --> 03:42:29.938]  And I am aware of that.
[03:42:29.938 --> 03:42:34.020]  And actually we have talked about that here on the show.
[03:42:34.020 --> 03:42:36.782]  So listen, Dan, why don't you write an article?
[03:42:37.743 --> 03:42:44.148]  And send it to Infowars.com with your points, and if it's well-written and sourced, we'll post it.
[03:42:44.148 --> 03:42:46.409]  We have people that give us different views.
[03:42:46.409 --> 03:42:47.970]  Write an op-ed piece.
[03:42:47.970 --> 03:42:50.592]  Send it to writers at Infowars.com.
[03:42:50.592 --> 03:42:50.992]  Okay?
[03:42:50.992 --> 03:42:51.833]  I appreciate your call.
[03:42:51.833 --> 03:42:57.817]  I'm sorry, Alan, to digress for three minutes on that, but, I mean, I just, the guy's really wound up.
[03:42:57.817 --> 03:42:58.838]  Do you have any comments to that?
[03:43:00.478 --> 03:43:07.365]  Yes, Divide and Conquer is quite right that the Catholic Church was heavily infiltrated.
[03:43:07.365 --> 03:43:22.180]  Malachi Martin came out and said that there was, in the hierarchy and going up and downwards, there was a group of homosexual priests there who covered for each other and were up to many other things which were definitely not Catholic whatsoever.
[03:43:22.980 --> 03:43:27.223]  It's a bureaucracy at the top and it's infiltrated and it's gone its own direction.
[03:43:27.223 --> 03:43:32.967]  And since Vatican I and Vatican II, technically, they've helped to destroy what was left of the Church.
[03:43:32.967 --> 03:43:40.332]  We've got to understand that everything that was an institution that gave values to people has been destroyed over the last hundred years.
[03:43:40.332 --> 03:43:45.175]  And what was left even of the Protestant religions, I can't even relate to them anymore.
[03:43:46.396 --> 03:43:54.965]  Because they're almost like TV evangelists with feel-good attitudes and never look at evil and just be happy.
[03:43:54.965 --> 03:44:02.473]  Everything has been destroyed along with the morality that goes with it and society has been debased to its bottom level.
[03:44:02.473 --> 03:44:06.257]  The deviancy in society is rampant through all society now.
[03:44:06.257 --> 03:44:08.139]  Look at what they're watching on television.
[03:44:08.699 --> 03:44:16.526]  And I don't watch TV, but if I tune in once every six months to a year, I feel like I've come back from an alien planet and how far it's gone.
[03:44:16.526 --> 03:44:22.431]  That's right, because they incrementally make it wilder and more sick and more mentally ill and just nonsensical.
[03:44:22.431 --> 03:44:27.155]  The cartoons are meant to screw the kids up and confuse them, so they'll be rudderless.
[03:44:27.155 --> 03:44:34.461]  And if you don't watch a lot of TV, then when you come back to it, it is just laced with propaganda, no matter what you're watching.
[03:44:34.461 --> 03:44:35.923]  I challenge people, you know,
[03:44:36.483 --> 03:44:41.431]  Stop drinking tap water and then six months later taste how horrible it tastes.
[03:44:41.431 --> 03:44:47.641]  I challenge people to not watch TV for six months and then go back to it and you will witness the programming.
[03:44:47.641 --> 03:44:48.122]  Go ahead, Alan.
[03:44:48.792 --> 03:44:53.777]  Well, even in much music television for the youngsters is simulated sex.
[03:44:53.777 --> 03:45:02.366]  I mean, it's almost, they're almost naked now, as well as taking the rest of their rags off, whatever they're wearing, because that's what you're seeing on television.
[03:45:02.366 --> 03:45:05.949]  That's the message to the young, that anything goes.
[03:45:05.949 --> 03:45:12.496]  Remember too, they said that they're going to make children obsessed, obsessed with sex, even before puberty.
[03:45:13.116 --> 03:45:13.316]  I think?
[03:45:30.202 --> 03:45:30.683]  I think so.
[03:45:53.586 --> 03:45:57.128]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:45:57.128 --> 03:46:01.590]  It's a pleasure to be with you.
[03:46:01.590 --> 03:46:03.911]  God bless you.
[03:46:03.911 --> 03:46:10.475]  I know it's gotta be stressful, you know, your job, and I can't even imagine the stress level that you're in, man.
[03:46:15.880 --> 03:46:17.481]  Well, statements really.
[03:46:17.481 --> 03:46:26.184]  I'd like to let the people of Southeast Texas know that we have got to use our own printers and ink to print up the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[03:46:26.184 --> 03:46:30.166]  We have got to get it out to as many people as possible.
[03:46:30.166 --> 03:46:34.147]  These documents themselves are really the most important things we have.
[03:46:34.147 --> 03:46:43.811]  And if people don't read them, if people don't understand them, then they have themselves to blame for what happens in the coming years.
[03:46:45.060 --> 03:46:50.343]  We are presently trying to organize a walk along the Mississippi River.
[03:46:50.343 --> 03:47:04.671]  Well, not along the river, literally, but we're trying to get a bunch of copies of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, to give, you know, hand out to people and, you know, show them, you know, the true documents and let them know what's really going on.
[03:47:04.671 --> 03:47:09.714]  You know, they need to understand that these documents are law.
[03:47:09.714 --> 03:47:12.316]  This is what our nation is supposed to abide by.
[03:47:13.035 --> 03:47:16.676]  Well, that's why we put free ones in with all the orders at InfoWars.com.
[03:47:16.676 --> 03:47:18.216]  Al, I appreciate your call.
[03:47:18.216 --> 03:47:20.297]  Aaron in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:47:20.297 --> 03:47:22.917]  Does anybody have a question for Alan Watt?
[03:47:22.917 --> 03:47:36.481]  Yeah, I was actually wanting to touch on the subject earlier about the mind control and about, you know, I've been noticing a lot on the television with Connect a Million Minds.
[03:47:36.481 --> 03:47:40.982]  I know Time Warner is the one who's putting it on the air.
[03:47:42.386 --> 03:47:45.868]  But I don't know if you've seen that commercial at all?
[03:47:45.868 --> 03:47:46.569]  No, what is it?
[03:47:46.569 --> 03:47:47.709]  I don't watch very much TV.
[03:47:47.709 --> 03:47:48.630]  What is it?
[03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:51.492]  It's an after-school care for children.
[03:47:51.492 --> 03:47:55.314]  Oh, kids shows are just 100% brainwashing, yeah.
[03:47:55.314 --> 03:47:59.757]  Yeah, it's a program that you put your children in.
[03:47:59.757 --> 03:48:03.780]  I've just seen it popping up recently.
[03:48:03.780 --> 03:48:05.841]  It basically just talks about
[03:48:10.742 --> 03:48:20.089]  Well, I've seen PBS shows, everyone, I've tuned in with kids about how great it is to take vaccine shots.
[03:48:20.089 --> 03:48:25.554]  Alan Watt, talking about children's programming, that's really bizarre when you watch it.
[03:48:25.554 --> 03:48:31.438]  It is bizarre, but it's always been that way, really, since the 60s onwards.
[03:48:31.438 --> 03:48:35.582]  Now, people realize that scriptwriters are paid by governments.
[03:48:36.337 --> 03:48:47.459]  To write cartoons with messages in it to do with environment and many, many other topics, preparing them for the life that they will grow up into, which will be entirely different from their parents.
[03:48:47.459 --> 03:48:56.441]  So they're being programmed that everything that they will experience in their life is normal, and when it comes along, they're pre-programmed for it from kindergarten up.
[03:48:56.441 --> 03:48:59.702]  The cartoons, um, it's amazing.
[03:48:59.702 --> 03:49:05.423]  You know, almost every author in Canada that writes novels is left on a grant from the government.
[03:49:06.283 --> 03:49:07.703]  Because we're socialists here, you see.
[03:49:07.703 --> 03:49:09.324]  Same in Britain.
[03:49:09.324 --> 03:49:15.026]  And they must write in all the politically correct updates and messages for... Well, that's what my dad pointed out.
[03:49:15.026 --> 03:49:29.030]  He said he's always seen propaganda in science fiction and novels, but he says now almost every book he buys randomly that's a bestseller is about how patriots are bad and gun owners are bad and drugging people is good and world government is good.
[03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:34.332]  I mean, we're just swimming in brainwashing, which is the prima facie evidence of a tyranny.
[03:49:35.112 --> 03:49:40.318]  It's tyranny, but it is to be a scientifically elitist-driven society.
[03:49:41.776 --> 03:49:44.377]  They say that we're post-democratic now.
[03:49:44.377 --> 03:49:45.957]  Democracy is too cumbersome.
[03:49:45.957 --> 03:49:48.118]  It's too many conflicting parties.
[03:49:48.118 --> 03:49:50.198]  Therefore, it's out the window.
[03:49:50.198 --> 03:49:56.699]  Regardless of the semblance they still give you for party opposition, it's really just an act.
[03:49:56.699 --> 03:49:57.760]  We're post-democratic.
[03:49:57.760 --> 03:49:59.080]  They're all on board with it.
[03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:00.620]  It's just an act for the public.
[03:50:00.620 --> 03:50:01.280]  That's all they are.
[03:50:01.280 --> 03:50:02.721]  That's all politics is now.
[03:50:02.721 --> 03:50:03.521]  Well said, Alan.
[03:50:03.521 --> 03:50:04.321]  Let's jam in.
[03:50:04.321 --> 03:50:05.341]  Let's jam in one more.
[03:50:05.341 --> 03:50:06.822]  We're hurrying towards the end.
[03:50:06.822 --> 03:50:08.622]  Monica in California, you're on the air.
[03:50:10.669 --> 03:50:11.591]  Hi Alex.
[03:50:11.591 --> 03:50:13.614]  Hi, what's on your mind?
[03:50:13.614 --> 03:50:17.179]  Yes, I just want to say that I pray for you and your family every day.
[03:50:17.179 --> 03:50:17.940]  Thank you.
[03:50:17.940 --> 03:50:20.344]  And I've been getting upset a little bit.
[03:50:20.344 --> 03:50:22.848]  Everybody's been giving you kind of a hard time about the Gulf.
[03:50:23.726 --> 03:50:26.228]  And I think you're doing an excellent job covering it.
[03:50:26.228 --> 03:50:29.591]  Well, one guy called in and said, I've never covered the Gulf.
[03:50:29.591 --> 03:50:32.093]  And he said everyone was upset.
[03:50:32.093 --> 03:50:34.174]  It was a mass hoax.
[03:50:34.174 --> 03:50:38.278]  It's attempted petty programming to say, everyone's mad at you.
[03:50:38.278 --> 03:50:39.639]  One caller said that.
[03:50:39.639 --> 03:50:41.440]  And then that becomes a self-fulfilling thing.
[03:50:41.440 --> 03:50:43.102]  We've been covering the Gulf probably too much.
[03:50:43.102 --> 03:50:46.144]  And they're using it as a distraction for their World War III with Iran.
[03:50:46.144 --> 03:50:47.245]  But stay there.
[03:50:47.245 --> 03:50:48.426]  I'm going to come back to you, Monica.
[03:50:48.826 --> 03:50:50.927]  And get your take on what's happening, try to jam in J.D.
[03:50:50.927 --> 03:50:58.912]  and Laura, and then get a quick comment from Alan Watt before he leaves on what he thinks, uh, something, you know, anything else important that he thinks we haven't covered here.
[03:50:58.912 --> 03:50:59.913]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[03:51:01.673 --> 03:51:04.675]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[03:51:04.675 --> 03:51:06.736]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[03:51:06.736 --> 03:51:09.498]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[03:51:09.498 --> 03:51:11.720]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[03:51:11.720 --> 03:51:13.120]  Okay, here it comes.
[03:51:13.120 --> 03:51:15.022]  But first, the facts.
[03:51:15.022 --> 03:51:16.963]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[03:51:16.963 --> 03:51:18.944]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[03:51:18.944 --> 03:51:22.647]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[03:51:22.647 --> 03:51:30.392]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[03:51:30.392 --> 03:51:30.992]  Sinofresh.
[03:51:31.252 --> 03:51:34.314]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.
[03:51:34.314 --> 03:51:40.136]  Call 888-906-3636 right now for $2 off per bottle when you mention GCN.
[03:51:40.136 --> 03:51:40.737]  That's it!

[03:51:46.039 --> 03:51:49.041]  But hurry, this offer is only for the first 1,000 customers.
[03:51:49.041 --> 03:51:49.401]  Call 888-906-3636.
[03:51:49.401 --> 03:51:49.461]  888-906-3636.
[03:51:49.461 --> 03:51:50.621]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[03:51:50.621 --> 03:51:51.001]  Mention GCN.
[03:51:51.001 --> 03:51:51.942]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[03:51:51.942 --> 03:51:52.222]  It works!
[03:52:01.431 --> 03:52:06.392]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:52:06.392 --> 03:52:07.192]  What have we got?
[03:52:07.192 --> 03:52:09.833]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:52:09.833 --> 03:52:10.853]  A republic.
[03:52:10.853 --> 03:52:13.273]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:52:13.273 --> 03:52:17.774]  It's not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:52:17.774 --> 03:52:23.335]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[03:52:23.335 --> 03:52:26.976]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:52:27.364 --> 03:52:31.048]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:52:31.048 --> 03:52:32.329]  You have been warned.
[03:52:32.329 --> 03:52:33.350]  We have the facts.
[03:52:33.350 --> 03:52:34.511]  We have the Constitution.
[03:52:34.511 --> 03:52:35.412]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:52:35.412 --> 03:52:36.313]  We have common law.
[03:52:36.313 --> 03:52:38.835]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:38.835 --> 03:52:41.778]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[03:52:41.778 --> 03:52:42.719]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:52:42.719 --> 03:52:47.683]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:52:47.683 --> 03:52:49.185]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[03:52:49.185 --> 03:52:50.266]  Don't Tread on Me.

[03:54:02.489 --> 03:54:03.590]  Yeah.
[03:54:12.077 --> 03:54:14.519]  Alan Watt has a lot of great material and information.
[03:54:14.519 --> 03:54:16.960]  His website CutIntoTheMatrix.com, one word.
[03:54:16.960 --> 03:54:21.203]  Of course, our sites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:21.203 --> 03:54:32.811]  We're going to rebroadcast in about five minutes, and if you're listening on the internet streams, in the first hour I covered the situation with Mexico just completely collapsing, and border state sheriffs begging for help.
[03:54:32.811 --> 03:54:34.612]  They're under siege.
[03:54:34.612 --> 03:54:38.975]  Plots to blow up dams in Texas by the Los Zetas CIA-controlled groups.
[03:54:39.915 --> 03:54:44.458]  This is the destabilization, the controlled chaos takedown of America.
[03:54:44.458 --> 03:54:47.340]  I wanted to jam in a few final calls though with Ellen Watt.
[03:54:47.340 --> 03:54:49.721]  Always great to have Ellen on with us.
[03:54:49.721 --> 03:54:56.325]  Monica, thank you for saying you appreciate our work, but anything else on your mind?
[03:54:56.325 --> 03:55:01.648]  Yes, I was watching TV the other day and something kind of alarmed me.
[03:55:01.648 --> 03:55:07.792]  Dr. Oz had a program saying how you can protect your family from anthrax.
[03:55:09.040 --> 03:55:13.403]  And I'm just... I want to tell the American people that, you know, we have little time.
[03:55:13.403 --> 03:55:16.144]  And it's not fun to fight tyranny.
[03:55:16.144 --> 03:55:16.564]  That's right.
[03:55:16.564 --> 03:55:20.687]  They hide anthrax attacks months before it even happened.
[03:55:20.687 --> 03:55:23.889]  And that's why on 9-11 I said they're going to launch an anthrax attack.
[03:55:23.889 --> 03:55:26.150]  And three weeks later we found out they'd already launched it.
[03:55:26.150 --> 03:55:27.551]  They pre-programmed.
[03:55:27.551 --> 03:55:29.992]  And when you know, it's incredibly obvious.
[03:55:29.992 --> 03:55:32.373]  Is that what you're getting at, Monica?
[03:55:32.373 --> 03:55:32.834]  Yes.
[03:55:32.834 --> 03:55:36.916]  And they're also pushing for adults to get this new DPT shot.
[03:55:37.691 --> 03:55:55.289]  So that's something that should be alarmed to the American people and look it's not fun to fight tyranny but we need to get off our butts and stop depending on Ron Paul and Alex Jones because you guys do a great job and you guys give a lot of your family time up to do what you do and it's greatly appreciated.
[03:55:55.529 --> 03:55:58.851]  Well, we appreciate you, but I'm not going to have a family in the future.
[03:55:58.851 --> 03:56:02.053]  I'm not going to be able to have grandchildren if we don't turn this around now.
[03:56:02.053 --> 03:56:16.162]  I mean, I don't think people understand that I use the parallel or the, you know, the analogy of those old movies where you're trapped in the chamber and the water's pouring in, and if you don't figure out the combination, you're going to, you know, drown very, very quickly.
[03:56:16.162 --> 03:56:20.045]  Alan, any other key points you want to make?
[03:56:20.045 --> 03:56:24.988]  Yeah, this G8, the G20 are going on now in Toronto.
[03:56:25.945 --> 03:56:34.487]  At the top of the list, of course, is the Gulf mess, and out of it will come the debate to do with the carbon taxes, energy conservation.
[03:56:34.487 --> 03:56:40.469]  We've already got smart meters put across Canada like crazy, just throwing them in there.
[03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:49.191]  These things have to communicate directly to the electric masters, or whoever they happen to be, by two methods, broadband and FM.
[03:56:50.311 --> 03:56:58.218]  And the purpose according to them in Britain is that they can then cut you off anytime they wish to when you exceed your allocated quota.
[03:56:58.218 --> 03:57:13.331]  Oh that's already being done in California and now the license plates are going to flash government homeland security messages and brainwashing all the license plates nationwide starting in California will be little telescreen brainwashing messages.
[03:57:13.331 --> 03:57:14.633]  Alan Watt, have you seen that article?
[03:57:14.633 --> 03:57:16.074]  I haven't seen that one.
[03:57:16.074 --> 03:57:17.115]  No, that's interesting.
[03:57:17.515 --> 03:57:19.996]  California license plates may go digital.
[03:57:19.996 --> 03:57:26.380]  And it says image ad blaring license plates and it goes on amber alerts and government messages.
[03:57:26.380 --> 03:57:28.921]  So now you're a slave advertising government propaganda.
[03:57:28.921 --> 03:57:44.609]  But going back to what you said, notice how Copenhagen and every other meeting they have, they've got to have a carbon tax for the G20 and now they'll have this new meeting and claim they just have this idea for the exact same global carbon tax treaty which will fund the private central banks.
[03:57:45.169 --> 03:57:47.790]  Yeah, they never change their tactics and their agenda.
[03:57:47.790 --> 03:57:52.752]  When they make a plan, doesn't matter what comes, they will run it through one way or another.
[03:57:52.752 --> 03:58:04.677]  But what's interesting too is that Canada, most Canadians don't even know it, they're using Canadian taxpayers' money to build big, giant, can-do, that's Canadian company, can-do nuclear reactors in China right now.
[03:58:05.419 --> 03:58:12.583]  And we're paying for it from Canada, because China, under the agreement to gas, is still a third world country, believe it or not.
[03:58:12.583 --> 03:58:15.344]  We can't even get them to repair our old ones here.
[03:58:15.344 --> 03:58:23.248]  That's right, you can't have new coal plants there because of carbon taxes, but I saw that in your news, but you're paying for nuke reactors in China to run factories.
[03:58:23.248 --> 03:58:24.629]  Well said, Alan Wan.
[03:58:24.629 --> 03:58:26.570]  Alan, we'll talk to you again soon.
[03:58:26.570 --> 03:58:28.771]  Alan, of course, is in our film, Fall of the Republic.
[03:58:28.771 --> 03:58:30.532]  Thank you so much for your amazing insight.
[03:58:31.112 --> 03:58:32.594]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[03:58:32.594 --> 03:58:33.174]  Thank you.
[03:58:33.174 --> 03:58:34.096]  Great job with the crew.
[03:58:34.096 --> 03:58:35.277]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:35.277 --> 03:58:36.558]  Don't forget the free iPhone app.
[03:58:36.558 --> 03:58:38.661]  Listen to the show at Infowars.com.
[03:58:38.661 --> 03:58:39.762]  See you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:58:39.762 --> 03:58:40.062]  Central.
