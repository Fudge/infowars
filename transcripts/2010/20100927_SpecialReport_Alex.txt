[00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:07.977]  It's the fall of 2010.
[00:00:08.037 --> 00:00:20.351]  The entire planet is awakening to the one world government being established by the private central mega banks that have orchestrated the world financial collapse.
[00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:23.174]  I have been on the air for 15 years.
[00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.076]  I started out
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:47.379]  With very meager beginnings, but thanks to listener support, spreading the word about the broadcast, telling people about InfoWars.com, purchasing our books and videos, we've been able to build a truly independent alternative media platform that is challenging the false left-right paradigm.
[00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:53.167]  The population of the planet is in the beginning stages of a massive awakening.
[00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:58.433]  One of the biggest political realignments, not just in the United States, but worldwide we've ever seen.
[00:00:59.254 --> 00:01:03.339]  But the technocrats, with all their slick propaganda, are turning up the heat.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.204]  That's why we are attempting to expand our operations.
[00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:13.070]  Just two and a half years ago we made the decision to move into these offices.
[00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:23.394]  We built the studio, we expanded our film production, our web news operations, and we were able to do it successfully thanks to your support.
[00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:32.558]  Now the media admits that billions of dollars a year of taxpayer money is funded to ABC, NBC, Fox, CNN, local stations,
[00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:38.117]  They now admit that much of their funding comes from the government and taxpayers.
[00:01:38.538 --> 00:01:39.859]  We don't have any of that funding.
[00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:41.420]  We don't have Fortune 500 sponsors.
[00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.273]  We don't have the big backing of News Corp like Glenn Beck does.
[00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:57.959]  We want to bring a true message of constitutionalism, a true message of liberty and freedom that is for national defense but not for invading innocent countries.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.465]  That is no compromise on the Second Amendment and our borders and our sovereignty that pushes to get us out of the criminal United Nations.
[00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:13.910]  That's why I'm asking you, if you believe in what we've done, to support the Money Bomb coming up October 14th.
[00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.915]  I'm going to be broadcasting on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv 24 hours.
[00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:23.297]  We're going to air exclusive interviews.
[00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:27.979]  With many of the top researchers in the world during that 24-hour.
[00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.022]  We're going to have a live guest on, but also video interviews we're going to be playing.
[00:02:33.482 --> 00:02:36.164]  We already have a lot of folks showing huge interest in the money bomb.
[00:02:36.464 --> 00:02:39.866]  More than $20,000, without us even promoting it, has already been donated.
[00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:43.908]  The last two money bombs we did raised more than $300,000 apiece.
[00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:54.977]  We need to be strong and actually expand during these hard times so the true message of liberty can get out there and expose the controlled left and the controlled right.
[00:02:55.357 --> 00:03:00.162]  So I want to give you a tour of the studios we've built in the last two years.
[00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:05.066]  Because while we've been building this, we've been doing the radio, making films, doing the websites, doing interviews.
[00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.788]  So we're having to do all this at the same time.
[00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:11.312]  And it's taken us a long time, but we've gotten it done because we're not some big mega corporation.
[00:03:11.812 --> 00:03:16.396]  We are individual people and a crew of around 20 that have been able to bring this together.
[00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:23.822]  And so I just want to thank you for supporting us, for spreading the word about the show, for supporting our sponsors, for buying the books and DVDs.
[00:03:23.842 --> 00:03:27.405]  I also want to thank my crew, everyone here at the office, for the
[00:03:28.462 --> 00:03:37.867]  Dedication that they've shown because I'm the face of InfoWars, but without my crew and the great research and the tireless work they've put in, none of this would have been possible.
[00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:39.108]  So it's all of us working together.
[00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:46.452]  So now I'm going to take you through the old studios we built the last two years and show you the new studios and I'm going to ask for your help.
[00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:55.782]  We're standing inside the radio slash TV multicast center and we did all this with prosumer gear for about $100,000.
[00:03:56.162 --> 00:04:02.884]  That may sound like a lot to people, but that's on the total low end of what it takes to do what we're doing.
[00:04:03.424 --> 00:04:07.946]  Because remember, we're individual citizens who are learning and doing this on our own.
[00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:09.366]  We're not the globalist.
[00:04:09.846 --> 00:04:13.828]  That's why this is so original and so important and so effective.
[00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:18.249]  We're reaching millions of people a day now, not millions of people a week.
[00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.909]  That is so exciting.
[00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.530]  Now we're going to the next level.
[00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.492]  We moved from a 3,500 foot facility to the 7,400 foot facility.
[00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:31.533]  And in that time frame, we've done thousands of radio shows and interviews.
[00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:40.285]  We have produced Fall of the Republic and the Obama Deception that collectively have been seen more than 40 million times for free online.
[00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:43.269]  We couldn't have done that without your support.
[00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.794]  This is the tip of the spear, the front lines of the Info War.
[00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:52.482]  And really in the last year I've had to recognize that we're the best there is.
[00:04:52.502 --> 00:04:53.664]  I don't like that.
[00:04:53.784 --> 00:04:55.447]  I like just being one more soldier.
[00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:59.232]  But I've come to the realization that Info Wars is the front line.
[00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:03.478]  We're having the biggest effect so I have a responsibility to up our game.
[00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:07.320]  to really accelerate our resistance against the globalists.
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:16.704]  So again, please support the October 14, 2010 Money Bomb and remember everything that is produced by InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[00:05:17.124 --> 00:05:23.767]  It's you out there that buys the DVDs so that we can then give it to everyone else for free and educate people.
[00:05:24.087 --> 00:05:29.169]  That's something the mega corporate giants would never do because they're authoritarian
[00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:30.649]  They're parasites.
[00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.630]  They're nothing but mercenaries.
[00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.371]  We're here spreading the true message of liberty.
[00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:43.013]  We're releasing on average two films a year and hundreds and hundreds of special video reports.
[00:05:43.674 --> 00:05:53.217]  The three-hour radio show six days a week and now we're trying to up the level of that to four films a year and two TV shows a week.
[00:05:55.162 --> 00:06:01.593]  Here you've got another one of the common areas where we've got video editing, webmasters, little carton demos, cubicle.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.801]  We've got customer service right up here at the front.
[00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:08.883]  This is the InfoWars operation.
[00:06:09.443 --> 00:06:14.205]  We're here in Rob's little cubicle where he's done such a great job and gotten so much information out.
[00:06:15.786 --> 00:06:22.769]  That's one reason we expanded so we can move our video editors into a little bit bigger areas just so they can store all the hard drives and videotapes.
[00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.992]  Here you can see the used cubicles we got for about $1,500 but they've done a good job here in the common area.
[00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.053]  We've got another little video editing area
[00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:32.255]  In here.
[00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:39.417]  Let me show you Rob Jacobson and Aaron Dykes offices where we actually edit our main films like the Obama deception and endgame.
[00:06:40.558 --> 00:06:48.805]  Truth Rising, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, Invisible Empire, all made right in here.
[00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:58.453]  But if you go back to films like America Destroyed by Design, they were made at Access Television in Austin, Texas and at my house on a computer that took about an hour to render one minute of video.
[00:06:59.053 --> 00:07:00.935]  And here we are in Aaron Dyke's office.
[00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:04.478]  So much of the great web mastering and articles that are written for InfoWars.
[00:07:04.998 --> 00:07:06.680]  Prison Planet, JonesReport.com.
[00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:07.621]  It's done right here.
[00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:14.690]  The video editing, a lot of the research for films, the fact-checking, it all goes on right in here in Aaron Dyke's nest.
[00:07:16.612 --> 00:07:22.219]  I guess it's kind of like that movie Field of Dreams, build it and they will come, but we're not building a baseball stadium.
[00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.481]  You know, this all grows out of my
[00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:53.478]  frustration about losing our second amendment our property rights sixteen seventeen years ago and decided to get an access television show and really the heart of it is listeners buying the books the dvds the films and here we are a little shipping department were are great cruise ship the books and videos out to you and again every part of the info wars crew uh... is just as vital as the other and this really is at the end of the day the heart of our operation because this is how you're able to support us and get materials
[00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:58.153]  Alright, so you've seen the new old studio that we were able to build thanks to your support.
[00:07:58.173 --> 00:08:01.574]  Let me show you the shell of the studio we built from an empty warehouse right next door.
[00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:34.895]  We've done the math and to furnish this cheaply, to hire the three or four people we need, to buy the video switchers, the hi-def cameras, the equipment, the servers, it's going to cost at least $400,000.
[00:08:35.396 --> 00:08:38.958]  That's why our goal with this money bomb is $500,000.
[00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:44.403]  And remember, tens of billions of dollars are spent of your taxpayer money every year.
[00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:48.045]  You don't have a choice in what they call behavior placement.
[00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.186]  They now admit they're doing it.
[00:08:49.286 --> 00:08:51.248]  Paying for news, paying for
[00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:58.169]  Anti-family, anti-second amendment, pro-global government messages to put in television shows, you name it.
[00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:00.550]  The propaganda is inside the show.
[00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.871]  We don't have that support of the New World Order.
[00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.332]  We have your support.
[00:09:05.952 --> 00:09:08.773]  We're not like the government coming with guns and making you give.
[00:09:09.113 --> 00:09:09.894]  It's your choice.
[00:09:09.914 --> 00:09:11.014]  Let me give you a quick tour.
[00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:19.438]  It's got four offices for IT people, webmasters, writers, video editors.
[00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.994]  And we've already got some basic furniture.
[00:09:29.478 --> 00:09:30.339]  Here's another office.
[00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:36.023]  Here's the war room so we can have a conference table, strategize.
[00:09:36.103 --> 00:09:37.864]  I can also do phone radio interviews in here.
[00:09:37.884 --> 00:09:42.527]  And of course this is very exciting, the men and women's bathrooms.
[00:09:46.144 --> 00:09:50.807]  And here we are in this Star Trek size control room.
[00:09:51.327 --> 00:09:55.970]  But we're planning to do blue screen in here with some of the video reports.
[00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:02.714]  We're going to have video editing in here and also the control center for the television shows that we're developing.
[00:10:03.174 --> 00:10:07.917]  All of this done organically by the citizen media via your support.
[00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:18.444]  All of this was done as economical as possible, but we still didn't skimp on quality so we can get the job done as best as possible.
[00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:20.226]  You've got the soundproofing in here.
[00:10:21.027 --> 00:10:25.213]  You've got the scaffolding for the lighting system that I'm about to purchase next week.
[00:10:25.513 --> 00:10:27.375]  We're going to have our high-def cameras in here.
[00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:30.197]  Right now we've just got a basic desk in here.
[00:10:30.217 --> 00:10:31.657]  We're going to get a broadcast desk.
[00:10:32.057 --> 00:10:37.159]  We're going to have television screens so I can show people what I'm talking about on the different programs.
[00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:42.781]  We're intending to do a daily news brief put out for free on the internet for the general public.
[00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:53.464]  And then also, as I said earlier, produce a weekly television show that we're going to try to get on some satellite network so we can also deliver that for free to the planet.
[00:10:53.749 --> 00:10:54.950]  But we're going to have to pay for that.
[00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:59.335]  So again, it's your support that will make or break this operation.
[00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:05.541]  But I have no doubt that fellow info warriors who have a love of liberty and the truth are going to come through.
[00:11:06.142 --> 00:11:11.347]  And you support us in other ways, by spreading the word about the radio show, about supporting the sponsors, buying the books and DVDs.
[00:11:11.848 --> 00:11:15.572]  It's just these money bombs, which were the idea of listeners going back three years ago,
[00:11:16.813 --> 00:11:21.837]  That really pushed us over the edge and gave us the funds to confidently expand.
[00:11:22.218 --> 00:11:35.650]  And there's also a lot of covert attacks we go through, daily hack attacks, other forms of harassment that I'm not going to get into because our research shows that only encourages the criminals in government and corporate America.
[00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:39.674]  But here you are in the heart of the new studio.
[00:11:40.515 --> 00:12:00.506]  Think about how far we've come thanks to your support and my great crew that a year ago this was an empty shell and so the next time you see this we'll have the set design completed and I'll be in this room reaching tens of millions of more people per month thanks to your support.
[00:12:00.907 --> 00:12:08.191]  That's why I'm asking viewers and listeners and supporters of all we do at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:14.916]  To step up to the plate and to donate as much as comfortable for you to the money bomb.
[00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:18.337]  If you're not doing well financially as most people are, please don't donate.
[00:12:18.557 --> 00:12:19.057]  Not a sin.
[00:12:19.577 --> 00:12:31.320]  But if you've got extra and you want to put it towards a cause that you know will have maximum effect, where can you look and find an institution, organization, a media outlet that
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.481]  produces more bang for the buck.
[00:12:33.982 --> 00:12:35.203]  We are the Infowar.
[00:12:35.603 --> 00:12:36.745]  You are the Infowar.
[00:12:37.145 --> 00:12:44.592]  And I'm asking you, October 14th, 2010, to join us for the marathon 24-hour broadcast.
[00:12:44.632 --> 00:12:55.883]  I may even go longer, with special live interviews and exclusive video interviews that we're going to be transmitting at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on AM and FM stations across the country.
[00:12:56.977 --> 00:13:01.621]  We understand that society is at that critical juncture, that critical crossroad.
[00:13:02.101 --> 00:13:07.866]  And I'm not going to sit back and just be comfortable with the effect we're having of reaching 2 million people a day.
[00:13:08.547 --> 00:13:10.188]  I want to attempt to go to the next level.
[00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:12.490]  10, 20, 30 million people a day.
[00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:15.893]  And this is the rebel base.
[00:13:16.173 --> 00:13:22.239]  This is the center that we will launch the attack on the Death Star from in the Info War.
[00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:34.066]  Join us for the 24-hour marathon Money Bomb at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com on October 14th and track the latest news and developments at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:34.426 --> 00:13:36.328]  The ball is in your court!
[00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:41.395]  Well, my friends, you've gotten the tour.
[00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:49.905]  We're not like NPR that's funded by all the big tax-free foundations, the Ford Foundation, David Rockefeller, and your taxpayer money.
[00:13:50.486 --> 00:13:55.873]  We are supported by you, by word of mouth, by your support of the sponsors, and by these money bombs.
[00:13:56.596 --> 00:13:58.157]  And that's why I've taken up the challenge.
[00:13:58.437 --> 00:13:59.257]  I'm like the captain.
[00:13:59.837 --> 00:14:02.078]  I'm either going to sail this ship or I'm going to go down with it.
[00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:06.000]  I'm not giving up on free humanity, on liberty, on everything that's good in life.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:19.926]  When I look at my beautiful, wonderful children full of creativity and literally the light of God in their eyes, I realize that I've got to, while I'm alive, put every bit of energy I can in to the fight against tyranny.
[00:14:20.766 --> 00:14:24.968]  That's why the globalists try to make you feel powerless, because in truth you have incredible power.
[00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:30.110]  Thank you for supporting the October 14, 2010 Money Bomb.
[00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:32.920]  Find out more at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
