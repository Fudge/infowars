[00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:09.382]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.382 --> 00:00:10.984]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:12.526]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:16.710]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.775]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:42.584]  Joel Skelson will be joining us in the next hour talking about the rest of the story dealing with Top Secret USA, the dark side of government that Cheney talked about, the secret militarization of police and military trying to create cadres, people that will carry out brutal oppression of the American people.
[00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:46.266]  The good news is it's not going too well for the globalists, even using private contractors.
[00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:46.906]  That's coming up.
[00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:48.716]  In the next hour.
[00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:05.337]  I think?
[00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:28.214]  In three parts.
[00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:30.755]  We've got it linked up at Infowars.com.
[00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:36.259]  We've got the blurb written above it with some of the history of other presidents being intelligence assets.
[00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:36.960]  Bombshell.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.682]  Barack Obama conclusively outed a CIA creation.
[00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:47.947]  And I've seen a lot of this info open source before, but Wayne's put it all together in one spot and found a lot of new data.
[00:01:47.947 --> 00:01:52.410]  And it's got to be a 25-page report, but I suggest you read it all.
[00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.392]  But here he is to go over it with us in the next 45 minutes to 50 minutes and
[00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:00.054]  To give us some new intel he's gotten.
[00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:06.936]  You can find it all and new developments at WayneMadsenReport.com and we have it linked up at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:09.797]  He's getting so much traffic it's barely staying up this morning.
[00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:10.477]  It's off and on.
[00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:12.238]  That's why we've got this key report.
[00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:15.779]  We're thankful for him letting us mirror it at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.880]  Wayne, congratulations on your in-depth investigation.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.420]  You've been in Chicago for weeks.
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.922]  You've been all over the country investigating this guy and you've gotten some powerful info.
[00:02:26.024 --> 00:02:28.105]  Oh thanks, but I feel so much chagrined.
[00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:37.592]  I think all this information is what should have come out during the presidential campaign, not on a sitting president of the United States.
[00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:43.696]  And I really think that myself and other members of the media, you know I'm not counting the corporate media, they never
[00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:56.289]  I don't want to touch these stories, but we really were remiss, I think, in delving into this guy's past during the campaign, which is what we've done with every other previous presidential candidate.
[00:02:56.289 --> 00:03:00.636]  And for some reason, I guess we all got hooked on the opium with Obama.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:10.527]  Well, Bush was so bad, I don't blame people for wanting to get hooked on the hopium, but I saw his advisors and Wall Street doubling down on him.
[00:03:10.527 --> 00:03:16.532]  I knew McCain was bad, but clearly he was the establishment's heir apparent, and so that's why I saw through him.
[00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:18.316]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:23.981]  And now we hear today that one of the Kagan boys has been hired on as an advisor to General Petraeus.
[00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.643]  So, what's the difference?
[00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:37.094]  You know, we had Obama speaking at the CIA headquarters, telling them, you know, how much he appreciates what they do, and don't worry about the investigations.
[00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:38.575]  You know, where he should have been taking
[00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:39.575]  I don't see any change.
[00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:41.796]  As a matter of fact, in some respects, I think he's worse.
[00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.110]  Well, Wayne, I have to agree with you.
[00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:18.859]  Unfortunately, because he brought left cover to this and a fresh face, and he's a better teleprompter reader, a lot of people went to sleep over the secret arrest, the expanding wars, the torture, America really losing its soul.
[00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.343]  And he's been protecting John Yoo and, of course, Alberto Gonzalez and Bush.
[00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:25.944]  And Bush feels so safe.
[00:04:25.944 --> 00:04:28.566]  Two months ago, he said, yeah, I ordered torture.
[00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:29.247]  I'd do it again.
[00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:43.821]  Oh, absolutely, and his Justice Department is going after Blagojevich again after all he got was a single count for lying to an FBI agent, and he wasn't even under oath.
[00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:45.402]  There's no transcript.
[00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:47.584]  He'd like to lay off on the Abramov deal.
[00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:52.788]  I mean, this guy, I mean, he's the gift that keeps on giving for the last people in the last administration.
[00:04:52.788 --> 00:04:53.669]  Well, Wayne, stay there.
[00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.090]  We've got a long segment coming up.
[00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.133]  Let's walk piece by piece through your bombshell report on the other side.
[00:04:59.912 --> 00:05:03.055]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:06.859]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:09.721]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:14.646]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:21.050]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.713]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:05:26.713 --> 00:05:31.256]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:39.741]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:41.943]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:05:41.943 --> 00:05:43.944]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:44.324 --> 00:05:52.154]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[00:05:52.154 --> 00:05:57.201]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:04.019]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:05.280]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.003]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:11.465]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:16.870]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.972]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:23.972 --> 00:06:29.935]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:33.616]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:38.417]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:44.359]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:47.921]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:49.901]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:51.022]  It's here.

[00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:05.528]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:14.370]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.011]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:29.833]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:39.976]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:45.398]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:52.881]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:55.642]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:00.336 --> 00:08:05.719]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:10.042]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:14.044]  We've got all three parts posted up at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:14.044 --> 00:08:17.306]  We've got our preface at the top of it.
[00:08:17.306 --> 00:08:22.349]  Bombshell Barack Obama conclusively outed as CIA creation.
[00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:26.391]  Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen is scheduled to appear live on this broadcast.
[00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:26.911]  He's here now.
[00:08:28.052 --> 00:08:34.377]  Thursday, August 19th at 12 Central, will reveal his groundbreaking series on Barack Obama's true origins.
[00:08:34.377 --> 00:08:41.442]  Madsen will share the bombshell revelations and extensive information from the following three articles and even more that has not been revealed.
[00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:44.964]  Tell your friends, family, and contacts to tune in and learn the truth.
[00:08:44.964 --> 00:08:50.208]  Also visit thewaynemadsenreport.com for further research and other exclusive reports.
[00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:52.190]  And be sure and subscribe.
[00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.132]  I mean, this guy formerly worked for the NSA, Naval Intelligence,
[00:08:56.152 --> 00:09:00.296]  He's written for some of the biggest publications in the country, Washington Post, you name it.
[00:09:00.296 --> 00:09:01.677]  He's a contributor to RT.
[00:09:01.677 --> 00:09:03.178]  He's a real patriot.
[00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:05.480]  His info is always borne out to be very accurate.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.844]  He told me where he got this new information, and it's verified and confirmed.
[00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:18.270]  It's just that there's been a... I don't want to go any further, because they keep clamping down every time they learn of a new place people are getting information.
[00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:29.118]  We're going to stop right there and Wayne can say as much as he wants, but this is all public source and verified in his three articles, but you need to read all three parts.
[00:09:29.118 --> 00:09:31.920]  The story of Obama all in the company.
[00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:38.421]  Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 at InfoWars.com or WadeMadsenReport.com.
[00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:42.963]  And again, his site is way down, so if you can't get it there, InfoWars.com.
[00:09:42.963 --> 00:09:55.627]  And get it out to everyone you know, because I have separately researched this in depth, making the Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic, and a lot of this was already public, but a lot of it is new and just completes the image.
[00:09:56.207 --> 00:09:56.907]  Of what we've got.
[00:09:56.907 --> 00:10:01.889]  Now before we go back to Wayne, I want to show people a few news stories that came out this week.
[00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:03.090]  Here's Politico.
[00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.510]  Don't look, birthers.
[00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.251]  It's Obama's passport.
[00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:09.412]  As if his passport means something.
[00:10:10.492 --> 00:10:18.698]  Now this came out on the heels of them shredding and destroying his mother's passport, which would be stamped where he was at what time.
[00:10:18.698 --> 00:10:31.408]  When he was born, the evidence shows in Kenya, but we know he gave up his citizenship and became Barry Sotaro, like Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, he became Barry Sotaro and gave up his U.S.
[00:10:31.408 --> 00:10:32.109]  citizenship.
[00:10:32.109 --> 00:10:33.210]  That is confirmed.
[00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.371]  That's mainstream news.
[00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:39.037]  Okay, and they try to abscond that evidence by only focusing on Kenya.
[00:10:39.037 --> 00:10:41.921]  I'm not bashing those that do, it's just this is smoking gun.
[00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:46.329]  Now, here it is, oops, Obama mama, passport destroyed.
[00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:58.373]  State Department claims record's gone for Stanley Ann Dunham prior to 1968, around the time that old Barack Obama was born in 1961.
[00:10:58.373 --> 00:11:04.314]  Continuing, White House offers glimpse of President Obama's passport documents, shows birthplaces Hawaii.
[00:11:04.314 --> 00:11:06.315]  So they're desperate.
[00:11:06.315 --> 00:11:09.676]  They won't put out the original passport, just a receipt of it.
[00:11:10.496 --> 00:11:15.280]  Okay, just a slip, not the real passport.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.964]  And now they're doing this at the same time they destroyed her passport.
[00:11:19.964 --> 00:11:22.546]  Very, very suspicious.
[00:11:22.546 --> 00:11:25.229]  So I wanted to just point out they've been involved in a cover-up.
[00:11:25.229 --> 00:11:33.456]  Wayne Madsen, go over your groundbreaking report, the new stuff you've discovered, and other things you haven't put in Part 1 or Part 2 or Part 3.
[00:11:33.456 --> 00:11:34.637]  You've got the floor.
[00:11:34.637 --> 00:11:35.758]  Wayne Madsen, go over it.
[00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:51.954]  Well, I started this investigation by looking at the company that President Obama went to work for after he graduated from Columbia, and it was Business International Corporation, and that was a company that had close ties to the CIA.
[00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:55.795]  They used some of their quote-unquote journalists as CIA cover.
[00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:59.296]  Uh, officers overseas.
[00:11:59.296 --> 00:12:09.021]  Now, in his book, Obama says, I went to work for a company in Manhattan after I graduated from Columbia, but it was the company, the CIA.
[00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:15.344]  It wasn't a company, and he was very disingenuous about talking about that.
[00:12:15.344 --> 00:12:20.186]  This was a company that had access to some of the biggest, most powerful
[00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:40.254]  People in the world, including Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin, Generalissimo Franco of Spain, and obviously this company did outreach to a lot of leftist leaders in places like Africa and Asia and other parts of the world, including Latin America.
[00:12:40.254 --> 00:12:44.316]  And then I started looking at, of course, his mother and her time.
[00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:47.920]  Uh, in Indonesia especially, but also Pakistan.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:13:02.935]  It turns out she was working not only for the Ford Foundation on micro-financing projects, and I have information that states that one of the CIA economic officers at the US Embassy in Jakarta worked on the same exact project while she was there.
[00:13:03.636 --> 00:13:10.420]  Financing, micro-financing for these farmers and artisans in central Java.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:21.565]  Now, Ann Dunham-Sotoro takes her son at 7 years old into Indonesia following the CIA-inspired coup.
[00:13:21.565 --> 00:13:26.748]  Two years later, Lorenzo Sotoro's stepfather was called back by General Suharto.
[00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:38.954]  From Hawaii, where he met Obama's mother in 65, but prior to the CIA coup, and he went to work for the Suharto's army.
[00:13:38.954 --> 00:13:52.661]  Now that, they killed an estimated up to one million Indonesian citizens, a lot of ethnic Chinese, and also reported members of the Indonesian Communist Party.
[00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:55.343]  So this is the environment she takes seven-year-old Barack
[00:13:55.843 --> 00:13:56.424]  Obama.
[00:13:56.424 --> 00:14:05.392]  I mean, who in their right mind would do that unless you were, you know, being assigned to work for the agency in those days?
[00:14:05.392 --> 00:14:07.394]  I also looked at Barack Obama Sr.
[00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:08.935]  Now, he was airlifted.
[00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:11.538]  It was called Project Africa, Airlift Africa.
[00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:17.023]  It was funded by a $100,000 grant from the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation.
[00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:21.086]  But that's because Tom Amboya, who was a Kenyan nationalist leader, pro-US,
[00:14:21.867 --> 00:14:22.228]  We're good.
[00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:43.787]  So that's building up his national security credentials, helping out the agency.
[00:14:43.787 --> 00:15:02.192]  And the reason for bringing these 230 students from Kenya, Tanganyika, and other soon-to-be independent British colonies in Eastern and Southern Africa was to compete with the Soviets and Chinese who were training their own leaders in these newly independent nations.
[00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:06.433]  And it was clearly to gain influence with these new governments.
[00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:07.114]  I don't know.
[00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:31.642]  Sending their people into other European countries during the democratic revolutions that were developing to try to put their people into power there.
[00:15:31.642 --> 00:15:40.930]  And so this story of intelligence agencies pre-positioning people to put them into political power so they control nations is extremely old.
[00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:48.417]  And we also know that Kenya in the 40s and 50s into the 60s was the admitted declassified global model of covert
[00:15:49.177 --> 00:15:57.545]  Takeovers and was the main base of operations aside from South Africa and Rhodesia for control of the African continent
[00:15:58.413 --> 00:15:59.013]  Well, right.
[00:15:59.013 --> 00:16:03.696]  And we have to remember, the same year that Barack Obama Sr.
[00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:19.866]  was brought over in the CIA airlift Africa project, is the same year that the Soviet Union opened the Petrovsky Memorial University in Moscow for the whole purpose of training people from these third world nations, these newly independent countries.
[00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:21.106]  I think so.
[00:16:38.815 --> 00:16:39.796]  I need class.
[00:16:39.796 --> 00:16:42.758]  Okay, your phone was cutting out a bit.
[00:16:42.758 --> 00:16:45.800]  He meets his mother, again, Barack Obama Sr.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:51.084]  meets Mama, and of course her daddy, you're gonna get into, has connections to the agency.
[00:16:51.084 --> 00:16:51.865]  He meets her where?
[00:16:52.443 --> 00:16:56.445]  In a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii.
[00:16:56.445 --> 00:17:17.572]  Now this is the height of the Cold War, and the only people who would be taking Russian in a place like Hawaii, which was like a military, I mean the military was all over Hawaii, the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, would be obviously people who were involved in some way, shape, or form with intelligence, or were being recruited into intelligence.
[00:17:19.293 --> 00:17:28.039]  Now, Stanley Armordunham, the grandfather, there's a photo of him welcoming Barack Obama Sr.
[00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:30.980]  to the airport in Hawaii.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.583]  Now, we were told that they met for the first time at the Russian language class.
[00:17:34.583 --> 00:17:35.923]  It's clear now.
[00:17:35.923 --> 00:17:42.327]  This furniture salesman, we were told, Stanley Armordunham's grandfather was in the furniture business.
[00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:46.250]  It seems like he was in much, much more than just selling furniture.
[00:17:48.177 --> 00:17:54.159]  Incredible and then of course you have her then being projected into the big foundation under Tim Geithner's father.
[00:17:54.159 --> 00:18:06.542]  I mean just on every side you've got all these connections in the report and then he's got a fake name, he's changing his name, we don't know where he's born, he comes from nowhere to become president.
[00:18:06.542 --> 00:18:08.523]  I mean it just, I mean the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:21.054]  Well, then we have a curious case of his grandmother, Madeline Dunham, who died right two days before Obama was elected president in 2008.
[00:18:21.054 --> 00:18:25.738]  The Obama campaign apparently didn't want her giving any interviews to the press.
[00:18:26.278 --> 00:18:41.458]  Maybe they were afraid she'd be like Newt Gingrich's mother with the Katie Couric interview and slip up and say something that would have embarrassed them, but she was one of the first female vice presidents at the Bank of Hawaii and now, lo and behold, we find out that that bank was used by the CIA.
[00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:42.559]  I think?
[00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:19.603]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back and keep going through your article that really puts all the pieces together that clearly this guy's an intelligence operative.
[00:19:19.603 --> 00:19:27.548]  We'll look at once he's in college, how he's sent to Pakistan, clearly in all sorts of secret ops.
[00:19:27.548 --> 00:19:29.689]  I mean, this is extremely clear.
[00:19:29.689 --> 00:19:36.953]  But also, if you really study deep intelligence, it's normally a family affair because then the whole family's connected.
[00:19:36.953 --> 00:19:39.014]  There's the peer pressure of the family.
[00:19:39.014 --> 00:19:39.935]  You can never leave.
[00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:44.380]  And so we see that pattern throughout history at the highest levels of intelligence.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:52.210]  We'll continue to look at Barry Sitaro, aka Barack Obama, the president, on the other side of this quick break with Wayne Madsen.
[00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.431]  You've got to read the report.
[00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:54.773]  Look at the photos.
[00:19:54.773 --> 00:19:56.595]  It is extremely damning.
[00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:59.239]  It's all at InfoWars.com and WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:20:00.606 --> 00:20:03.228]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[00:20:03.228 --> 00:20:12.057]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.

[00:20:50.162 --> 00:20:50.342]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:05.532]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:46.613 --> 00:21:46.813]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[00:21:53.839 --> 00:22:08.124]  The economy is crumbling, debts soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:22:08.124 --> 00:22:19.207]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on prisonplanet.com.
[00:22:20.194 --> 00:22:28.460]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.023]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:22:33.023 --> 00:22:48.233]  Now I'm offering 50 all-organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds, so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:22:49.195 --> 00:22:51.916]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:22:51.916 --> 00:23:00.301]  I'm Big John Lipscomb, and my company is SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:01.521]  Attention to all U.S.
[00:23:01.521 --> 00:23:09.466]  drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles with an auto warranty about to expire or no warranty coverage at all.
[00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:15.589]  Due to our country's economic crisis and auto repair costs on the rise, if your vehicle has less than 130,000 miles as of today,
[00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:28.153]  You could be one of the millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle covered under United Repair Plans and have 100% of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you.
[00:23:28.153 --> 00:23:32.835]  This low-cost vehicle service contract has been established under United Repair Plans.
[00:23:33.055 --> 00:23:40.117]  And is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession.

[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:49.820]  800-809-4491.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.140]  Again, that's 800-809-4491.
[00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:12.800]  Okay, we're talking to Wayne Madsen, who is a top security expert at the National Security Agency, Naval Intelligence.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.924]  Whenever you watch C-SPAN and you're seeing an Intelligence Committee hearing, you'll see him in the gallery as a press reporter.
[00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:23.589]  He's written for literally scores of top newspapers and publications here in the country.
[00:24:23.589 --> 00:24:28.433]  So a very top-level source and investigative journalist.
[00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:30.435]  WayneMadsenReport.com has it all.
[00:24:31.215 --> 00:24:38.876]  Bottom line, before we go through more of the history, more of the evidence of this, what type of asset is Obama?
[00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:40.457]  What was their plan?
[00:24:40.457 --> 00:24:48.678]  Because he was nested at the highest level, both sides of his family, at the biggest foundations that themselves created the CIA.
[00:24:48.678 --> 00:24:59.060]  The way I read this in my past research, it appears that from very early, he was put into the highest level schools being developed for where he is now.
[00:25:01.232 --> 00:25:10.255]  Anyone who remembers the movie The Manchurian Candidate, that's exactly what they were trying to do in that movie, setting somebody up.
[00:25:10.255 --> 00:25:22.698]  But in this case, it looks like it was the CIA that had their own Manchurian Candidate and groomed this individual for higher office, and he eventually got it.
[00:25:22.698 --> 00:25:24.759]  Now, one of the things that I found was
[00:25:26.881 --> 00:25:38.143]  Some CIA files from the 1970s referring to behavioral science work being done by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:25:38.143 --> 00:25:46.765]  And one of the universities, and this comes from Richard Helms, the director himself, one of the favorite universities for behavioral science work.
[00:25:46.765 --> 00:25:50.166]  And let's face it, that was out of the Office of Science and Technology.
[00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:51.146]  That's MKUltra.
[00:25:52.006 --> 00:25:53.908]  Dr. Sidney Gottlieb's operation.
[00:25:53.908 --> 00:26:01.193]  One of the favorite universities for this research was the University of Hawaii, where Barack Sr.
[00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:03.695]  met Anne Stanley Dunham.
[00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:08.278]  So you're saying he's trained in mind control, or he's under mind control?
[00:26:08.278 --> 00:26:14.523]  Oh, I don't know, but we know what MKUltra was.
[00:26:14.523 --> 00:26:17.025]  It was extreme behavioral modification.
[00:26:17.025 --> 00:26:21.128]  Yeah, the LA Times reported the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, was in that program.
[00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:35.034]  Well, some of the other universities mentioned in this were Yale, MIT, University of Michigan, and UCLA, and the University of Hawaii is think of that as the fifth favorite university for this work by Richard Helms.
[00:26:35.034 --> 00:26:37.015]  Now, this work was done through the Advanced Research
[00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:38.196]  Well, for me, what, you know,
[00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:09.762]  You know, the cherry on top, and we haven't covered 10% of the evidence in your article, is that the way they hide all his records, the way he goes right into college but is never there.
[00:27:09.762 --> 00:27:11.142]  He's all over the world.
[00:27:11.142 --> 00:27:12.662]  He's in hot zones.
[00:27:12.662 --> 00:27:19.705]  It looks like they were training him in all sorts of, you know, in the field training from a very early age.
[00:27:20.543 --> 00:27:31.312]  Well, the CIA front company in Honolulu actually came up with a false corporate history, said that they had been doing business in Hawaii since it was a territory.
[00:27:31.312 --> 00:27:34.015]  Everything was fake with that particular company.
[00:27:34.015 --> 00:27:39.539]  When the company went bust and accused of being a Ponzi scheme, where have we heard that recently?
[00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:41.000]  Certainly we have with Stanford.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.483]  We heard it with Enron.
[00:27:43.483 --> 00:27:45.765]  And here we had another one, NBCCI.
[00:27:46.385 --> 00:27:54.191]  So here we have an early example of the CIA setting up this financial firm to make these payoffs out of Honolulu.
[00:27:54.191 --> 00:27:58.634]  And when it goes bust, the innocent investors are all being brought in.
[00:27:58.634 --> 00:28:00.915]  And Grandma's running it?
[00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:04.058]  Well, she's working at the Bank of Hawaii, which is laundering the money.
[00:28:04.058 --> 00:28:05.639]  She's running the escrow account.
[00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:20.350]  At the Bank of Hawaii, which is where the agency is placing the funds to transfer to their boys over in Asia, these dictators and these favored politicians.
[00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:25.673]  I would also note that AIG, which he bailed out, which was started by Ken Starrs,
[00:28:26.754 --> 00:28:34.282]  Great uncle in Shanghai was also at CIA front doing the same thing in Asia.
[00:28:34.282 --> 00:28:36.745]  From China to Japan to Korea and everywhere else.
[00:28:36.745 --> 00:28:41.350]  Well look what Top Secret USA confirms what you'd already reported on for years.
[00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:47.196]  Close to a million secret private spies in the US alone with the highest security level.
[00:28:47.196 --> 00:28:48.117]  That's one out of 300 Americans.
[00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.470]  Absolutely.
[00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:54.972]  So, you know, we look at all this, and it's fascinating.
[00:28:54.972 --> 00:29:05.315]  I also found a very rare copy of a book that was written in 1968, and actually favorably reviewed in an article in the Boston Globe in 1969.
[00:29:06.415 --> 00:29:10.479]  And the book lists a bunch of Obama's family's bosses.
[00:29:25.495 --> 00:29:26.156]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:29:26.156 --> 00:29:28.618]  I want to go over all of it when we come back and what it means.
[00:29:28.618 --> 00:29:29.418]  We're on the march.
[00:29:29.418 --> 00:29:30.399]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.452 --> 00:30:00.056]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:57.113 --> 00:30:58.854]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:04.387]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.387 --> 00:31:05.287]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.287 --> 00:31:08.730]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.590]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:14.473]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.473 --> 00:31:15.214]  It's true.
[00:31:15.214 --> 00:31:20.097]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.097 --> 00:31:20.917]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.917 --> 00:31:24.500]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.202]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.402 --> 00:31:29.202]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.202 --> 00:31:31.963]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.963 --> 00:31:35.644]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:36.424]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.424 --> 00:31:40.585]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:45.627]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:32:35.459 --> 00:32:42.225]  As powder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:32:42.225 --> 00:32:46.109]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:32:46.109 --> 00:32:53.556]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:32:53.556 --> 00:32:54.016]  Thank you.
[00:33:03.755 --> 00:33:07.178]  Failure to communicate.
[00:33:07.178 --> 00:33:10.481]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:33:10.481 --> 00:33:16.486]  So you forget what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:33:16.486 --> 00:33:17.667]  Well, he gets it.
[00:33:17.667 --> 00:33:26.714]  I don't like it any more than he did.
[00:33:26.714 --> 00:33:29.337]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:29.337 --> 00:33:30.698]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.552 --> 00:33:38.194]  Okay, Wayne Madsen in layman's terms.
[00:33:38.194 --> 00:33:39.515]  Recap this evidence.
[00:33:39.515 --> 00:33:42.837]  Go over other areas.
[00:33:42.837 --> 00:33:44.338]  Some of the new things you've discovered.
[00:33:44.338 --> 00:33:45.779]  You've been getting into archives.
[00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:47.300]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.001]  A lot of things are newly declassified on a routine basis.
[00:33:50.001 --> 00:33:52.943]  They do everything they can to cover up his history.
[00:33:52.943 --> 00:33:59.027]  Now they shred his mother's passport that would be stamped for where she really was when he was born.
[00:33:59.027 --> 00:34:00.588]  And then release his passport.
[00:34:01.768 --> 00:34:07.270]  Uh, which he's already had a passport before, even if he got it through fraud, that's easy to do.
[00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:17.995]  This proves nothing, but it's their attempt to say, look, we're not going to give you the original, you know, with his feet stamped on it and the doctor's signature, uh, you know, of his real birth certificate.
[00:34:17.995 --> 00:34:23.157]  We're going to give you his passport to supposedly shut up the birthers.
[00:34:23.157 --> 00:34:25.638]  And you've got this entire history of being groomed.
[00:34:26.118 --> 00:34:39.833]  The entire family on every side, deep inside the big foundations, working for Geithner's dad, the Rockefellers, Annenberg, all of them, all the top globalists, and then you've got even more in this three-part series.
[00:34:40.737 --> 00:34:46.741]  Well, you know, we go back to January, February of 2008 and the big U.S.
[00:34:46.741 --> 00:34:57.308]  State Department passport scandal where some contractors working for a company called the Analysis Corporation were caught looking into
[00:34:57.908 --> 00:34:59.469]  Obama's passport files.
[00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:10.558]  Now, that company at the time was headed by Don Brennan, who used to be with the CIA and came up with a lot of this rendition program under Bush, and now he's the Deputy National Security Advisor.
[00:35:10.558 --> 00:35:12.319]  How convenient.
[00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:17.863]  So, you know, they said, oh, well, Hillary and McCain's passports records were being looked at.
[00:35:17.863 --> 00:35:19.624]  I think that was a diversion.
[00:35:19.624 --> 00:35:22.506]  That was, you know, make it look like they were going at it.
[00:35:23.587 --> 00:35:33.790]  The fact is, they were going in to see exactly what Obama had, if anything, with a smoking gun, as far as his passport files.
[00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:46.052]  And I was getting ready to say, before the break, that one of the names in this book of 3,000 active agents during the late 50s and 60s is Peter Ernest, who's now the director of the International Spy Museum.
[00:35:46.052 --> 00:35:48.013]  And remember, Obama took his two daughters.
[00:35:58.781 --> 00:36:06.728]  So what does this mean to the American people, Wayne, to have someone who clearly was manufactured and put into power?
[00:36:06.728 --> 00:36:09.470]  I mean, obviously they can blackmail him, but that's not even needed.
[00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.551]  He's just completely controlled.
[00:36:11.628 --> 00:36:15.472]  Well, I think that's the problem.
[00:36:15.472 --> 00:36:21.357]  Presidents and Vice Presidents, Senators or Members of the House do not require security clearances.
[00:36:21.357 --> 00:36:23.038]  In fact, they're elected.
[00:36:23.038 --> 00:36:26.041]  Their staffs require the clearances, but they do not.
[00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:29.965]  But that job falls to the press to vet these people and the media.
[00:36:30.831 --> 00:36:34.033]  It failed miserably during that campaign.
[00:36:34.033 --> 00:36:44.480]  On what I reported out of Chicago with his private life and now with this, his background with the agency, this was all available back in 2008.
[00:36:46.841 --> 00:36:53.305]  And no one, you know, pursued it because everybody was listening to this brilliant orator.
[00:36:53.305 --> 00:36:56.146]  And, you know, beware these brilliant orators.
[00:36:56.146 --> 00:36:57.887]  History is replete with them.
[00:36:57.887 --> 00:37:03.010]  And it turned out to be nothing more than demagogues when they've gotten into office.
[00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:09.794]  We know many cases of it throughout recent and even ancient history where that's happened.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:18.105]  Continuing, there's a lot of other areas of your detailed three-part series that we haven't covered yet.
[00:37:18.105 --> 00:37:21.528]  Kind of recap it, get into some other areas and connections we didn't go over.
[00:37:21.528 --> 00:37:24.810]  And then, when we talked last night, you said you're still doing more research.
[00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:32.536]  There's even more, that there's mountains of this, and just every place you turn, CIA, CIA, CIA, CIA.
[00:37:33.598 --> 00:37:40.063]  Well, let's look at his father, Barak Sr., who was brought over in his Air Lift Africa project.
[00:37:40.063 --> 00:37:49.710]  Now, his mentor in Kenya, who was assassinated in 1969, Tom Mboya, basically selected Barak Sr.
[00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.692]  and others over more qualified candidates.
[00:37:52.692 --> 00:38:00.758]  And I've got a not very obscure Reuters piece from London in 1960, where one of the opposition leaders in Kenya says, wait a minute,
[00:38:01.158 --> 00:38:08.846]  Some of the people who were passed over had better academic qualifications, better certificates than the people who were selected.
[00:38:08.846 --> 00:38:10.528]  Well, it's obvious why they were selected.
[00:38:10.528 --> 00:38:23.182]  They were selected, and in the case of Obama Sr., he's married with a kid and went on away already in Kenya when he arrived in Hawaii, and he marries Obama's mother, who's just graduated from
[00:38:23.602 --> 00:38:25.422]  From a high school.
[00:38:25.422 --> 00:38:32.244]  It's very clear that this was some sort of a CIA operation to get those two together.
[00:38:32.244 --> 00:38:44.827]  You know, you gotta wonder what kind of parent would put their own child up for auction because the agency finds it important to do.
[00:38:44.827 --> 00:38:51.629]  But Ann Boyer is interesting because he basically was spying for the CIA at all these Pan-African meetings and basically he was
[00:38:52.189 --> 00:38:52.730]  I don't think so.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:16.603]  Now, we talked last night and I said, it seems to me that they knew that they would build him up as this messianic leader.
[00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:43.938]  And then they study societal movements, individual psychology, mass psychology.
[00:39:43.938 --> 00:39:54.685]  The architects know that he would then not deliver the milk and honey and the restored economy and the end of torture, the end of wars with his advisors and who put him in power.
[00:39:54.685 --> 00:40:02.610]  They were always planning to not deliver any of his promises and then politically destroy him.
[00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:08.374]  And you concurred with me, so I want you to expand on your view.
[00:40:08.374 --> 00:40:11.176]  What was their plan for Barry Sitaro, a.k.a.
[00:40:11.176 --> 00:40:12.557]  Barack Obama?
[00:40:12.557 --> 00:40:21.423]  And what does their master plan encompass for the nation and for their front puppet?
[00:40:21.423 --> 00:40:29.810]  More balkanization, more division, selling Africa on AFRICOM or AFRICON being set up.
[00:40:31.132 --> 00:40:34.842]  I mean, what's the overall program with Plan Obama?
[00:40:35.492 --> 00:40:40.534]  Well, you know the CIA regularly uses people who are called futurists.
[00:40:40.534 --> 00:40:43.636]  Now, this isn't the weird kind of thing where people look at them.
[00:40:43.636 --> 00:40:55.161]  These are subject area experts who try to look to see where technology, where politics, where population, where demographics will be 20, 30 years into the future.
[00:40:55.161 --> 00:40:56.501]  And they seek to steer it.
[00:40:56.501 --> 00:41:04.005]  They seek to already know what people are going to want to do, where culture is going to bring them, so they can be pre-positioned to dominate those systems.
[00:41:04.005 --> 00:41:04.805]  That's what Google is.
[00:41:05.322 --> 00:41:12.283]  Well, if we go back in time to 1960, we're looking at the CIA looking at the demographic changes of the United States.
[00:41:12.283 --> 00:41:14.504]  Increasing African-American population.
[00:41:14.504 --> 00:41:20.825]  I don't think they really banked on the increase of the Hispanic population.
[00:41:20.825 --> 00:41:31.967]  Obviously, that came later, but... Well, wait a minute, it's come out that the Ford Foundation, billions, Bill and Melinda Gates, tens of millions, Tumatcha and La Raza, Ford Foundation going back 60 years, creating those groups.
[00:41:32.327 --> 00:41:33.048]  Right.
[00:41:33.048 --> 00:41:46.476]  Well, I think the one thing, because of the Civil Rights Movement, they were looking at... Look, Martin Luther King was the leader of the African-American group, movement, the people, in this country.
[00:41:46.476 --> 00:41:50.159]  He broke with Johnson in 67, over Vietnam.
[00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:52.060]  Steered very hard to the left.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:59.165]  And the CIA, I'm sure, said, God, we can't... If we're going to get a leader, we can't have a Malcolm X. We can't have a Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:41:59.165 --> 00:42:01.086]  We have to make sure that when we have one,
[00:42:03.007 --> 00:42:07.230]  In line to become president, somebody that we can basically control.
[00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.691]  Let me back you up.
[00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:23.298]  Margaret Singer in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, on record in public letters with the Rockefeller Foundation saying, we've got to pose as liberals, get the black leaders in place so we can abort most of them, and they've been successful.
[00:42:23.298 --> 00:42:25.220]  51% of blacks never make it out of utero.
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.740]  They're murdered in the womb.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.561]  So they did that.
[00:42:28.121 --> 00:42:28.421]  Absolutely.
[00:42:43.991 --> 00:42:55.237]  So you look back in 1960, and is it beyond the pale to consider the fact that they may have wanted to groom somebody from a very early age, like a baby?
[00:42:55.237 --> 00:43:06.622]  You know, you've got his parents and his grandparents basically in their pocket, and then you've got this stuff about behavioral science work at the University of Hawaii.
[00:43:06.622 --> 00:43:07.883]  There's just so many gaps.
[00:43:08.503 --> 00:43:20.677]  In the histories of not only the president, but also his mother, his father, his grandfather, and his grandmother on his mother's side.
[00:43:20.677 --> 00:43:25.182]  So when you see gaps like that, now you look at any other president,
[00:43:26.073 --> 00:43:29.016]  I think that's the key that you just hit on.
[00:43:29.016 --> 00:43:32.600]  You have all this effort to cover up the past.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.881]  You've got CIA connections.
[00:43:46.474 --> 00:43:46.614]  I don't
[00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:05.910]  I think?
[00:44:29.983 --> 00:44:30.984]  What do you remember?
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:53.929]  Remember last November when old man Bush, HW41, and Jeff Bush paid what was called a courtesy call to the White House?
[00:44:53.929 --> 00:44:56.011]  We were not even told what that was about.
[00:44:56.011 --> 00:44:57.252]  A courtesy call.
[00:44:57.252 --> 00:44:58.714]  That's all we were told.
[00:44:58.714 --> 00:45:05.921]  Well, you know, you've got the guy who the CIA headquarters is named after and his son visiting Obama.
[00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:13.328]  So, I mean obviously you're saying their plan was to have a controlled asset who was supposedly African-American in there, that's clear, but
[00:45:29.784 --> 00:45:31.406]  How is their plan going?
[00:45:31.406 --> 00:45:34.831]  I mean, did they mean for him to be a messianic leader and be successful?
[00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:42.241]  And has their attempted launch of this African-American Napoleon failed?
[00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:46.848]  Or did they plan to just use him as a distraction and then destroy him?
[00:45:47.586 --> 00:45:49.687]  Well, I think he's given them everything they want.
[00:45:49.687 --> 00:45:53.289]  Look, Operation Iraqi Freedom is now Operation New Dawn.
[00:45:53.289 --> 00:46:00.113]  I mean, right out of George Orwell's newspeak lexicon, we're showing pictures of convoys leaving Iraq.
[00:46:00.113 --> 00:46:03.235]  50,000 troops are going to stay and we're going to see an increase in contractors.
[00:46:03.235 --> 00:46:03.915]  What's that all about?
[00:46:03.915 --> 00:46:06.056]  By the way, I have the New York Times today on that.
[00:46:06.056 --> 00:46:12.119]  They say, oh, private contractors and intelligence operatives will now run the government.
[00:46:12.119 --> 00:46:12.660]  So this is a
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:27.527]  Practice runs for the US and other countries where they don't just stage coups, they come in and put in their entire apparatus through these giant armored embassies and control everything and just have plainclothes death squads running the nation.
[00:46:27.992 --> 00:46:28.833]  Well, that's right.
[00:46:28.833 --> 00:46:35.136]  And look what Obama, right after he comes in, you know, he allows the CIA to overthrow President Julian Honduras.
[00:46:35.136 --> 00:46:40.879]  He wants to build seven military bases in Colombia, and the Constitutional Court of Colombia just shot that down.
[00:46:40.879 --> 00:46:45.962]  So, you know what Obama wants to do with now being shot down by the court in Colombia?
[00:46:45.962 --> 00:46:54.867]  I mean, this guy is on lock, stock, and barrel by these intelligentsia, you know, the intelligence community, because he's not said no to them
[00:46:55.627 --> 00:46:56.008]  Ever.
[00:46:56.008 --> 00:46:58.870]  I mean, Patriot Act, still in effect.
[00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:02.814]  We have an increase in electronic surveillance.
[00:47:02.814 --> 00:47:10.380]  We got these people, the CIA and Google, and NSA and Google, and Microsoft and everything else.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.563]  So he's allowing, he ran on openness.
[00:47:14.503 --> 00:47:18.765]  The Freedom of Information Act is still not being implemented.
[00:47:18.765 --> 00:47:19.885]  It's still backlogged.
[00:47:19.885 --> 00:47:22.346]  Requests are not being honored.
[00:47:22.346 --> 00:47:28.409]  So, I mean, everything he ran on, he has lied on very fundamental constitutional issues.
[00:47:28.409 --> 00:47:32.970]  And we were told that he taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School.
[00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:41.614]  I don't know which law he was teaching, because when you look at his actions, it looks like he's teaching the Constitution of North Korea, not of the United States of America.
[00:47:42.014 --> 00:47:43.796]  You know, I'd laugh, but it isn't funny.
[00:47:43.796 --> 00:47:44.957]  This is really happening.
[00:47:44.957 --> 00:47:49.602]  I mean, this is really the private offshore corporate takeover of society.
[00:47:49.602 --> 00:47:54.407]  They're setting up their fusion centers run by the CIA in every major city.
[00:47:54.407 --> 00:47:55.829]  They're federalizing the police.
[00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:56.890]  They're training U.S.
[00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.151]  SWAT teams in Iraq.
[00:47:58.832 --> 00:47:59.032]  We're
[00:48:14.071 --> 00:48:16.051]  Follow them and then make fun of them.
[00:48:16.051 --> 00:48:21.113]  And this was all encouraged, like something right out of 1984.
[00:48:21.113 --> 00:48:28.614]  And they had private snatch and grab teams in front of news cameras on purpose, grabbing activists, putting bags on their heads.
[00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:31.475]  Now what happened in Toronto, same thing in England.
[00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:39.517]  They are globally deploying a scientifically developed corporate oppression, a corporate black op tyranny.
[00:48:40.357 --> 00:48:46.265]  And I mean clearly this is the complete shadow takeover and now it's out in the open.
[00:48:46.265 --> 00:48:47.828]  I mean this is so illegal, Wayne.
[00:48:48.499 --> 00:48:50.380]  Well, let me say another thing about Obama.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.303]  You know, he has had scheduled two trips to visit Indonesia.
[00:48:54.303 --> 00:48:56.744]  Both trips have been postponed.
[00:48:56.744 --> 00:49:07.691]  You know, I think he knows that when he arrives in Jakarta, the Indonesian press, some foreign press, will start looking at his time there.
[00:49:07.691 --> 00:49:10.833]  And I don't think they want that kind of attention on that.
[00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:12.214]  And I think that's one reason.
[00:49:12.214 --> 00:49:14.396]  Now, he's always said he's had other priorities.
[00:49:14.396 --> 00:49:16.237]  I think the oil spill was one reason.
[00:49:16.377 --> 00:49:17.738]  No, that's another issue, Wayne.
[00:49:17.738 --> 00:49:19.519]  You keep bringing up great points.
[00:49:19.519 --> 00:49:22.581]  It's admitted he was in Indonesia longer than he said.
[00:49:22.581 --> 00:49:24.582]  Then he lied about being in the Muslim school.
[00:49:24.582 --> 00:49:26.883]  It's fine if he's a Muslim, but why lie about it?
[00:49:26.883 --> 00:49:29.605]  I mean, everything he's ever told us is a lie.
[00:49:29.605 --> 00:49:30.926]  You went over that earlier.
[00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:36.509]  I mean, when the parents met, when the grandparents met, when all this happened, we learned it's all a fiction.
[00:49:37.426 --> 00:49:57.576]  Well, and the other thing I discovered is when they were, uh, before they went to Hawaii, they were in Mercer Island, Seattle, in the state of Washington, and, and, uh, I did find, uh, in a list of these, uh, agents, the CIA people, uh, the name of the, uh, chief engineer for, uh, Boeing, and he was, his area of primary assignment
[00:49:58.016 --> 00:49:59.318]  Was Mercer Island.
[00:49:59.318 --> 00:50:05.124]  Now, Madeline Dunham worked for the Boeing Corporation during World War II, in which you're talking.
[00:50:05.124 --> 00:50:09.768]  So, he's the only guy listed with the agency in Mercer Island.
[00:50:09.768 --> 00:50:12.631]  You know, we've got to figure the time frame here.
[00:50:12.631 --> 00:50:19.118]  You know, you could, conspiracy or coincidence, but I think that's much more than a coincidence.
[00:50:19.898 --> 00:50:24.482]  But we know his father's involved in all these secretive activities.
[00:50:24.482 --> 00:50:30.927]  Now Obama's involved with Odinga, having the Muslims riot to create the prime ministership for him.
[00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:35.391]  I mean, just everything Obama does is dastardly.
[00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:38.254]  Everything he does is skullduggery, laced.
[00:50:39.114 --> 00:50:41.857]  And it's just at every turn.
[00:50:41.857 --> 00:50:43.479]  And then there's the secrecy.
[00:50:43.479 --> 00:50:49.806]  And so I think you've conclusively proven that the media has been involved in a cover-up of this guy's true history.
[00:50:49.806 --> 00:50:53.430]  And everything we know about Barry Sitaro is a complete stinking lie.
[00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.493]  Final segment straight ahead with Wayne Madsen.
[00:50:55.493 --> 00:50:56.694]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:50:56.694 --> 00:50:58.196]  Our sites at GCNLive.com.
[00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:05.587]  If your handgun is loaded and easy to get to, it's also dangerous.
[00:51:05.587 --> 00:51:11.069]  What if you could reach your loaded handgun instantly and still provide a margin of safety for your family?
[00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:14.710]  Introducing the Drag & Draw Gun Vault from MyQuickSafe.com.

[00:52:00.013 --> 00:52:02.394]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.394 --> 00:52:04.716]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.716 --> 00:52:07.918]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.918 --> 00:52:13.021]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.021 --> 00:52:17.223]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.523 --> 00:52:19.887]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.887 --> 00:52:22.771]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.771 --> 00:52:25.675]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:33.287]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:39.006]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.006 --> 00:52:41.868]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.868 --> 00:52:45.551]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.551 --> 00:52:46.612]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.612 --> 00:52:47.953]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.953 --> 00:52:49.454]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.344 --> 00:52:59.944]  Attention!
[00:52:59.944 --> 00:53:04.946]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[00:53:04.946 --> 00:53:10.627]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[00:53:10.627 --> 00:53:17.769]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[00:53:17.769 --> 00:53:23.791]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement.
[00:53:23.891 --> 00:53:27.492]  For you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[00:53:27.492 --> 00:53:30.893]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[00:53:30.893 --> 00:53:37.714]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:46.496]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[00:53:46.676 --> 00:53:51.285]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[00:53:51.285 --> 00:53:51.345]  800-902-6969.
[00:53:51.345 --> 00:53:51.505]  800-902-6969.
[00:53:51.505 --> 00:53:51.685]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[00:54:24.987 --> 00:54:29.630]  Ladies and gentlemen, we haven't done one since Monday.
[00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:30.911]  You want me to do it again?
[00:54:30.911 --> 00:54:33.753]  I appreciate the work you've done.
[00:54:33.753 --> 00:54:36.976]  I want people to read Wayne Madsen's report.
[00:54:36.976 --> 00:54:41.299]  And I want them to read the breakdown that we've done on top of it.
[00:54:41.299 --> 00:54:47.023]  So I want you to search this key term and make it the number one search term today.
[00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:50.346]  And I'm going to launch another one next hour.
[00:54:50.346 --> 00:54:52.347]  We'll hit them with two torpedoes.
[00:54:52.347 --> 00:54:57.472]  But the article isn't ready at PrisonPlanet.com separately on what Google's doing trying to take over the web with Verizon.
[00:54:58.786 --> 00:55:02.147]  So that'll be launched at 30 afterwards, Joel Skousen, next hour.
[00:55:02.147 --> 00:55:06.789]  But I want you to search the term Bombshell Barack.
[00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:09.410]  Bombshell Barack.
[00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:11.771]  Bombshell Barack.
[00:55:11.771 --> 00:55:15.173]  And then that will lead them to WayneMadisonReport.com.
[00:55:15.173 --> 00:55:22.676]  Search the term Bombshell Barack right now, and that will lead them to this investigation.
[00:55:22.676 --> 00:55:24.797]  We'll post these videos later at YouTube.
[00:55:24.797 --> 00:55:25.657]  We'll link those in.
[00:55:27.358 --> 00:55:33.104]  Drudge Report routinely then links to this, and we can push this mega-viral thanks to you taking action.
[00:55:33.104 --> 00:55:36.447]  We'll expose this CIA-created asset.
[00:55:36.447 --> 00:55:39.971]  Bombshell Barack is the search term.
[00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:41.532]  Bombshell.
[00:55:41.532 --> 00:55:42.273]  One word.
[00:55:42.273 --> 00:55:45.716]  B-O-M-B-S-H-E-L-L Barack.
[00:55:46.317 --> 00:55:47.738]  Please take action.
[00:55:47.738 --> 00:55:48.658]  We're 10 for 10.
[00:55:48.658 --> 00:55:49.999]  We've done this 10 times.
[00:55:49.999 --> 00:55:52.500]  You have never failed in the info war.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.822]  Bombshell Barack.
[00:55:54.822 --> 00:55:58.524]  And we're going to launch another torpedo in T-minus 35 minutes.
[00:55:58.524 --> 00:56:00.365]  Closing comments, Wayne Madsen.
[00:56:00.365 --> 00:56:03.987]  I hope people will support your investigative journalism by subscribing.
[00:56:03.987 --> 00:56:08.950]  You give most of what you do away for free, but it's important that people support you as an investigative journalist.
[00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:09.830]  How do they subscribe?
[00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.131]  To waynemadsenreport.com.
[00:56:11.744 --> 00:56:20.849]  Well, you just go to Wayne Mattson Report, M-A-D-S-E-N Report, all one word, dot com, and you'll see a thing that says join now.
[00:56:20.849 --> 00:56:24.271]  Click on that and it'll step you through the process.
[00:56:26.559 --> 00:56:37.023]  Well, you know, it is time-consuming to go through, locate, and then go through these extensive files because we're talking about kind of ancient history.
[00:56:37.023 --> 00:56:39.604]  You know, the CIA, 1960, 61, up through the 70s, and there's a lot that you just have to
[00:56:45.286 --> 00:56:49.429]  Well, you certainly deserve respect and support, Wayne.
[00:56:49.429 --> 00:56:52.011]  We've got about a minute and a half left in this hour.
[00:56:52.011 --> 00:56:54.592]  Any other key tidbits or points you wanted to make?
[00:57:14.977 --> 00:57:26.865]  Well, I noticed that in his mother's passport record, there was a name that had been crossed out, Soharko, which is yet another name we have in addition to Sotoro.
[00:57:26.865 --> 00:57:30.528]  I guess the question is, who is Soharko?
[00:57:30.528 --> 00:57:32.169]  Who was he?
[00:57:32.169 --> 00:57:38.854]  Was that another name assigned to President Obama when he was in Indonesia?
[00:57:38.854 --> 00:57:40.555]  How do you spell Soharko?
[00:57:41.523 --> 00:57:46.626]  S-O-E-H-A-R-K-O.
[00:57:46.626 --> 00:57:47.607]  Very suspicious.
[00:57:47.607 --> 00:57:49.768]  Anything else?
[00:57:49.768 --> 00:57:59.834]  Well, I would just urge people to, you know, while we have the internet, you know it's under tremendous assault by the guys like Cass Funstein and his friends.
[00:58:02.996 --> 00:58:10.458]  Search all this information out, save it, because it may become useful later on before it disappears entirely.
[00:58:10.458 --> 00:58:10.898]  I agree.
[00:58:10.898 --> 00:58:12.139]  They're clearly telegraphing.
[00:58:12.139 --> 00:58:18.940]  They're planning to launch false flag attacks on the web, blame it on China or Russia, and use it as a way to start controlling it.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:19.841]  Absolutely.
[00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:21.181]  WayneMadsenReport.com.

[00:59:53.382 --> 00:59:55.765]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.765 --> 00:59:58.508]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:02.679 --> 01:00:03.279]  We've got it.
[01:00:03.279 --> 01:00:09.781]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:00:09.781 --> 01:00:14.202]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:14.202 --> 01:00:19.844]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:00:22.124 --> 01:00:23.505]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:23.505 --> 01:00:26.126]  It is Friday, the 23rd day of July 2010.
[01:00:26.126 --> 01:00:31.728]  For the next 30 minutes, we have an exclusive interview with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:38.510]  Of course, with his hit TV show now going into its second season, they're producing Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:40.111]  He has had trouble all over the country.
[01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:55.583]  Most of this we can't talk about because it's the TV show, but now the harassment, the Homeland Security surveillance has gotten so bad that the governor wants to talk about this pattern here today and we're very honored that he contacted us yesterday to give us this exclusive.
[01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:59.126]  I'm also playing my own part in the show as a consultant.
[01:00:59.126 --> 01:01:05.592]  But the headline at Infowars.com by Curt Nemo, exclusive Jesse Ventura talks with Alex Jones about government harassment of his TV show.
[01:01:06.332 --> 01:01:08.112]  And it is really intensifying.
[01:01:08.112 --> 01:01:09.473]  Governor, thank you for joining us.
[01:01:09.473 --> 01:01:10.193]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:10.193 --> 01:01:11.073]  Great to be here.
[01:01:11.073 --> 01:01:17.635]  And again, I come on the air with you, Alex, just to inform the public out there of exactly what's going on with our U.S.
[01:01:17.635 --> 01:01:18.815]  government, it seems.
[01:01:18.815 --> 01:01:21.436]  Well, we appreciate you coming here first, sir.
[01:01:21.436 --> 01:01:26.857]  Well, you know, ABC or NBC or none of them are going to hear what I'm going to talk about.
[01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:27.937]  You can bet on that.
[01:01:27.937 --> 01:01:30.418]  And I know that this is a place where freedom speaks.
[01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:35.611]  Have you had a chance to see the ABC News story that tries to make a joke about the harassment?
[01:01:35.611 --> 01:01:39.613]  It says Jesse Ventura brings his conspiracy theories to the Capitol.
[01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:45.135]  No, I didn't look at it, but you know what they always say in the entertainment world, any publicity is good.
[01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:47.316]  Absolutely, as long as they get your name right.
[01:01:47.316 --> 01:01:52.779]  Governor, break down the latest or the history of this, wherever you'd like to start.
[01:01:56.067 --> 01:02:02.892]  It's the second season, so they told me that I could do an episode on the murder of John F. Kennedy, which to me is the corner post.
[01:02:02.892 --> 01:02:14.200]  That's the pillar of everything, the downfall, in my opinion, of our country in the last 50 years, was because if you can murder the President and get away with it, what can't you get away with?
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:25.989]  And what we did, we wanted to take a finishing shot, very humble, of simply me standing in front of the eternal flame at Arlington National Cemetery.
[01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.490]  No talking, no anything.
[01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:33.653]  And bear in mind, Kevin Costner did it in JFK.
[01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:35.174]  They filmed him there.
[01:02:35.174 --> 01:02:39.456]  Well, we went to this character, this Ken Hawes, who's the U.S.
[01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:45.899]  Army Chief of Public Affairs, and he denied it and wouldn't let me do it.
[01:02:45.899 --> 01:02:47.600]  We did it anyway, though, Alex.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.720]  We got the shot.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.363]  In fact, the security people there were very helpful, and they even moved people out of the way.
[01:02:53.363 --> 01:02:55.964]  So obviously, it didn't filter to the guy on the ground.
[01:02:59.198 --> 01:02:59.518]  I don't know.
[01:03:29.158 --> 01:03:29.778]  We're good to go.
[01:03:52.213 --> 01:03:53.374]  We're good to go.
[01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:29.911]  Governor, this is incredible.
[01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:39.700]  You have the Army trying to set the precedent at a national park of who can film and can't and saying no one's allowed to when the news media is down there every week.
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.261]  I see it constantly.
[01:04:41.261 --> 01:04:42.503]  This is so dangerous.
[01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:43.463]  Stay there.
[01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:44.925]  We're going to come back from a quick break.
[01:04:46.266 --> 01:04:47.767]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:04:47.767 --> 01:04:51.048]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:04:51.048 --> 01:04:53.009]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:04:53.009 --> 01:04:57.171]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:15.479 --> 01:05:21.421]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:05:21.421 --> 01:05:27.084]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:05:27.084 --> 01:05:31.626]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:05:31.626 --> 01:05:39.729]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:42.311]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:44.693]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:44.693 --> 01:05:52.520]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.584]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[01:06:00.273 --> 01:06:05.256]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:05.256 --> 01:06:06.257]  What have we got?
[01:06:06.257 --> 01:06:08.698]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:09.699]  A republic.
[01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.361]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:14.622]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:16.643]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:18.324]  So they think they own our land?
[01:06:18.324 --> 01:06:19.645]  They think they own our water?
[01:06:19.645 --> 01:06:20.245]  Children?
[01:06:20.245 --> 01:06:21.366]  Our education?
[01:06:21.366 --> 01:06:22.207]  Our money?
[01:06:22.207 --> 01:06:25.849]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:06:26.209 --> 01:06:31.195]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:32.216]  We have the facts.
[01:06:32.216 --> 01:06:33.357]  We have the Constitution.
[01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:34.279]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:06:34.279 --> 01:06:35.160]  We have common law.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.683]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:37.683 --> 01:06:41.467]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:06:41.567 --> 01:06:46.532]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:06:46.532 --> 01:06:48.034]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:06:48.034 --> 01:06:49.115]  Don't tread on me.
[01:06:49.115 --> 01:06:56.502]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:07:00.086 --> 01:07:04.628]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.628 --> 01:07:05.548]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.548 --> 01:07:08.970]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:09.830]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:14.712]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.712 --> 01:07:15.452]  It's true.
[01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:20.335]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:21.155]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.155 --> 01:07:24.736]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.736 --> 01:07:28.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.638 --> 01:07:29.439]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.439 --> 01:07:32.202]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.202 --> 01:07:35.886]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:36.686]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:40.831]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.831 --> 01:07:45.596]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.876 --> 01:07:50.038]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.038 --> 01:07:51.819]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:54.080]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.701]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.701 --> 01:08:08.566]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.566 --> 01:08:11.548]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:16.009]  Again, it's Friday, July 23, 2010.
[01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:19.151]  Governor Jesse Ventura joins us live from California.
[01:08:19.151 --> 01:08:30.960]  The last few days he was in D.C., part of a pattern of the government trying to block his First Amendment rights and selectively doing this for people's political or abuse, period, just on the country.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:39.666]  Governor, for those who just joined us, recap what's happened, get more into what Congresswoman Bachman is saying and the Army trying to block you from a national park.
[01:08:40.246 --> 01:08:41.148]  Well, what happened?
[01:08:41.148 --> 01:08:53.344]  We're doing a show on the murder of John F. Kennedy, and apparently the Army doesn't like it, and they're in charge of Arlington National Cemetery, and the gentleman's name is Ken Hawes, spelled H-A-W-E-S.
[01:08:55.827 --> 01:09:00.950]  For those listeners out there that are as outraged as I am, I'll give you his phone number.
[01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:01.030]  310-235-7621.
[01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.871]  Again, 310-235-7621.
[01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:15.118]  We're good to go.
[01:09:33.684 --> 01:09:39.147]  That's not true because Kevin Costner got filmed there for the movie JFK with Oliver Stone.
[01:09:39.147 --> 01:09:40.528]  You see it in the film.
[01:09:40.528 --> 01:09:47.932]  Additionally, Mr. Hawes stated that you were denied in part because of the nature of your television program.
[01:09:47.932 --> 01:10:02.940]  Specifically, he stated, the topic of your particular episode, which alleges that the United States government was directly involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[01:10:06.218 --> 01:10:11.220]  So now the army bureaucrats are deciding what Americans can do inside the country.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.762]  Apparently, they have control over what you can film.
[01:10:15.762 --> 01:10:19.023]  I was a governor, a mayor, I'm a U.S.
[01:10:19.023 --> 01:10:21.804]  Navy Vietnam veteran.
[01:10:21.804 --> 01:10:24.125]  John Kennedy was a Navy man.
[01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:29.947]  I'll bet you if President Kennedy could speak out on this, he would be more than happy to let me film at his eternal flame.
[01:10:30.848 --> 01:10:40.911]  Well, the issue is I've seen the news many times filmed there, and as you mentioned, it's in many films and documentaries, and the film JFK, which is saying it was a government operation.
[01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:53.855]  So they're clearly discriminating against you, and it just shows this atmosphere of government control, where the government's involved in productions of movies, where the army will try to block people even, you know, interviewing people in the military.
[01:10:53.855 --> 01:10:56.636]  And you know what the bottom line is, Alex?
[01:10:57.682 --> 01:11:00.683]  These people are supposed to work for us.
[01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:02.224]  We pay their salaries.
[01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:05.906]  It's called paying your taxes.
[01:11:05.906 --> 01:11:19.973]  That's what irks me a great deal, is the fact that I pay this guy's salary, and yet he has the ability to deny me from getting photographed by whom I consider the greatest president in my lifetime?
[01:11:20.919 --> 01:11:23.200]  At his eternal flame?
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.282]  Because he happens to not like the content of my program?
[01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:28.603]  And where we're going?
[01:11:28.603 --> 01:11:33.645]  Because some of us believe the Warren Commission's a crock of you-know-what?
[01:11:33.645 --> 01:11:34.045]  You know?
[01:11:34.045 --> 01:11:38.327]  And we still seek the truth, even today?
[01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:43.970]  By the way, on another subject, she wouldn't go on air with me.
[01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:48.352]  It's kind of the same subject, but I did sit down with Marina Oswald for two and a half hours.
[01:11:49.215 --> 01:11:50.297]  Wow, tell us about that.
[01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:08.422]  If they can kill the President and get away with it, then they can do anything.
[01:12:08.422 --> 01:12:16.006]  And I said, it's important that history and we learn the truth, no matter how delayed it is, if indeed we've been lied to.
[01:12:16.006 --> 01:12:21.710]  And she looked me right in the eye, and she said, would you sacrifice your children for the truth?
[01:12:22.854 --> 01:12:37.614]  Well, it doesn't mean she's necessarily being threatened, but it means that certainly she feels that there is still a threat out there that if maybe she spoke out
[01:12:37.714 --> 01:12:38.034]  I think so.
[01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:04.525]  Of course, the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, her husband clearly set up.
[01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:12.169]  It's now admitted that he was CIA at that airbase in Japan and that they had him infiltrate Russia and then brought him back.
[01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:17.831]  Of course, the film JFK covers all of that with historical accuracy.
[01:13:17.831 --> 01:13:24.614]  Governor, off air you said, boy, the government sure is acting guilty, not just with this JFK thing, but everything.
[01:13:25.454 --> 01:13:31.357]  Everything we look into, Alex, the government behaves like they're guilty of hiding something.
[01:13:31.357 --> 01:13:39.101]  Let me put it to you this way, and I won't say where I was, but I've now been tailed and put on by Homeland Security.
[01:13:39.101 --> 01:13:42.883]  I've been tailed by the Coast Guard.
[01:13:42.883 --> 01:13:45.924]  And we don't do anything illegal, Alex.
[01:13:45.924 --> 01:13:48.325]  Everything we do on the show is above board.
[01:13:48.325 --> 01:13:53.968]  We try to go through proper channels, and we simply, if something requires us to go
[01:13:56.593 --> 01:13:59.114]  I like to refer to Homeland Security today as the Gestapo.
[01:14:23.365 --> 01:14:24.286]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:24.286 --> 01:14:26.769]  You've got almost every major federal agency under it.
[01:14:26.769 --> 01:14:33.457]  And now under the REAL ID Act, they want you to have to have a federally licensed through the state ID card to even be able to work.
[01:14:33.457 --> 01:14:36.080]  It's a total tracking system.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.405]  And you also went somewhere where you were threatened to be shot.
[01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:51.173]  Well, yeah, they have areas in the country where they have signs up that say lethal forces authorized, which I find unbelievable.
[01:14:51.173 --> 01:15:00.317]  Whatever happened to a trial, whatever happened to going to court, you know, how can you be judged during an executioner in one failed swoop?
[01:15:00.317 --> 01:15:09.060]  Now, I'm not saying that they necessarily have or did, but there's areas in this country where they've posted that lethal forces authorized, if you cross this line.
[01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:14.735]  And there's not even a fence, it's just you cross some magical line on a dune buggy, you're dead.
[01:15:16.067 --> 01:15:17.167]  Well, you could be.
[01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:22.749]  It's not saying that you are, but they're authorized to take you out with lethal force if they desire.
[01:15:22.749 --> 01:15:42.055]  Well, Governor, I mean, as you know, in 1947, the CIA got unlimited money, funding, and secrecy, and if you've got 60 years of a group being able to operate with unlimited funds and power, I mean, they've been caught shipping in narcotics, they've been caught engaging in assassinations, and they just think this country is their own private whorehouse.
[01:15:42.535 --> 01:15:48.362]  Well, you know, and unfortunately our elected officials are allowing them to get away with it.
[01:15:48.362 --> 01:15:57.753]  You know, we need to, you know, get back our country and remember always, Alex, that we the people and this country was formed, we were supposed to be the priority.
[01:15:58.735 --> 01:16:02.700]  It was supposed to be a country of citizens first, government second.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:04.102]  But it's not that way today.
[01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:12.672]  Government is number one, and we citizens fall by the wayside because everything is directed towards the government and the survival of the government.
[01:16:13.462 --> 01:16:30.608]  Governor, I know you've been busy shooting, but earlier in the week, Top Secret USA came out, two-year Washington Post investigation, 850 plus thousand private corporate chiefs, that's close to a million, with the highest level security clearance there is.
[01:16:30.608 --> 01:16:33.909]  And the Washington Post described it as a complete takeover of society.
[01:16:33.909 --> 01:16:37.691]  So we have a private corporate system that's giving itself government power.
[01:16:38.391 --> 01:16:39.992]  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.
[01:16:39.992 --> 01:16:42.792]  I said that probably about 10 years ago.
[01:16:42.792 --> 01:16:54.816]  I said the internet right now is the only thing where you can, you know, have total freedom on there.
[01:16:54.816 --> 01:17:00.018]  But I said rest assured the government will put high priority on getting control of the internet.
[01:17:00.718 --> 01:17:07.099]  Because that's the one place you can go to, supposedly, and have freedom, and they're not going to allow that.
[01:17:07.099 --> 01:17:22.102]  You know, more and more I'm seeing our country becoming under the thumb of corporate America, not even... Well, it's like, you know, it came out in the article that I said, I now am very clear on why we're in Afghanistan, Alex.
[01:17:22.102 --> 01:17:26.963]  It has nothing to do with terrorism and Bin Laden, that's all a big red herring.
[01:17:26.963 --> 01:17:28.403]  We're there for the lithium.
[01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:34.957]  Did you see that story a month ago where they found $8 billion of lithium over there?
[01:17:34.957 --> 01:17:36.078]  I mean, think about it.
[01:17:36.078 --> 01:17:40.743]  That runs every cell phone, computer, and soon-to-be electric cars.
[01:17:40.743 --> 01:17:45.589]  The only reason we're in Afghanistan is to get the lithium.
[01:17:45.589 --> 01:17:48.232]  Now, why won't they just be honest and say that?
[01:17:50.029 --> 01:17:57.552]  Well, they went on to admit that it could be potentially a trillion dollars, and that they knew this in reports before they invented it.
[01:17:57.552 --> 01:18:01.733]  It's also about the trillions in oil in that region as well.
[01:18:01.733 --> 01:18:04.794]  Right, you know, and that's the reason we're there.
[01:18:04.794 --> 01:18:11.437]  All this stuff on terrorism, put it this way, terrorists are like a motorcycle gang.
[01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:17.059]  You know, they're out there, yes they do exist, and there is a possibility that you could run into them very minute.
[01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:22.584]  But they are not what this government is making us believe.
[01:18:22.584 --> 01:18:24.686]  They are not like the Nazi Army.
[01:18:24.686 --> 01:18:28.209]  They are not like the Japanese Army of World War II.
[01:18:28.209 --> 01:18:29.711]  They're not a country out there.
[01:18:29.711 --> 01:18:36.057]  They're just small groups of criminals that are involved in criminal activity and you have to deal with them.
[01:18:36.057 --> 01:18:41.663]  But to put our country under lock and key and take our rights away from us.
[01:18:42.981 --> 01:18:50.903]  Absolutely, and every major technology firm out there is getting massive government contracts to spy on the American people.
[01:18:50.903 --> 01:18:54.023]  They've completely butchered the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:18:54.023 --> 01:18:56.784]  All these groups have the motive for the terror.
[01:18:56.784 --> 01:18:57.964]  They stand to gain from it.
[01:18:57.964 --> 01:19:11.347]  Did you see the Financial Times of London with one of Obama's advisors, Robert Shapiro, saying of if, in fact guys print that quote for me, that if Obama doesn't have an Oklahoma City or 9-11 soon, his political
[01:19:12.527 --> 01:19:23.191]  Well, how would Oklahoma City or 9-11 help him?
[01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:28.773]  Well, okay.
[01:19:28.773 --> 01:19:39.197]  Well, all I know, Alex, is that, you know, I fully expect within ten years that we're going to have to have national ID cards and you're going to have to show them to go state to state.
[01:19:39.497 --> 01:19:43.739]  Oh, they're already saying that we've got a national ID card and they do want you to have it for anything.
[01:19:43.739 --> 01:19:49.542]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest host of the hit television program Conspiracy Theory.
[01:19:49.542 --> 01:19:50.282]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:50.282 --> 01:19:52.643]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are our websites.
[01:19:52.643 --> 01:19:53.544]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:53.544 --> 01:19:53.884]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.016 --> 01:20:03.618]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[01:20:03.618 --> 01:20:12.446]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.

[01:20:22.955 --> 01:20:23.596]  I don't think so.
[01:20:46.052 --> 01:20:48.574]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.

[01:22:56.351 --> 01:22:57.092]  Check them out today.
[01:22:59.753 --> 01:23:00.333]  Attention!
[01:23:00.333 --> 01:23:05.336]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[01:23:05.336 --> 01:23:11.018]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[01:23:11.018 --> 01:23:18.181]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[01:23:18.181 --> 01:23:26.966]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[01:23:28.126 --> 01:23:31.289]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[01:23:31.289 --> 01:23:38.114]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[01:23:38.114 --> 01:23:46.902]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[01:23:47.062 --> 01:23:51.745]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.

[01:23:51.805 --> 01:23:51.906]  800-902-6969.
[01:23:51.906 --> 01:23:52.086]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[01:24:04.687 --> 01:24:07.449]  Alright folks, final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:24:07.449 --> 01:24:09.991]  Don't forget, the film's now being censored online.
[01:24:09.991 --> 01:24:16.976]  The Obama Deception, and of course, Fall of the Republic, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:16.976 --> 01:24:20.698]  Since I mentioned it, top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[01:24:20.698 --> 01:24:25.742]  Financial Times of London, the bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in Obama's leadership.
[01:24:25.742 --> 01:24:32.287]  Sid Shapiro adding, he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence in short of an
[01:24:32.807 --> 01:24:37.348]  9-11 event, or an Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think of how he can do that.
[01:24:37.348 --> 01:24:39.389]  Governor Ventura, is that chilling?
[01:24:39.389 --> 01:24:41.069]  Well, unbelievable.
[01:24:41.069 --> 01:24:49.971]  I mean, that they talk about that an event has to take place to have confidence in your president, what, that he can fight a war, that we have the strongest military in the world?
[01:24:49.971 --> 01:24:51.171]  We've already proven that.
[01:24:51.171 --> 01:24:57.993]  You know, I just find it outrageous that someone would say that, and what they'll do for political gain.
[01:24:58.905 --> 01:24:59.887]  Well, it's very brazen.
[01:24:59.887 --> 01:25:02.851]  They think we're a bunch of idiots to be talking like that openly.
[01:25:02.851 --> 01:25:09.402]  Governor, in closing, let's talk about the issue of the First Amendment and give out that number one more time.
[01:25:13.277 --> 01:25:16.458]  He's the Army Chief of Public Affairs and he's the guy that wouldn't allow me.
[01:25:16.458 --> 01:25:31.603]  And in the letter, Michelle Bachmann, it said his office also stated that he would almost certainly not allow filming at John F. Kennedy's Eternal Flame without the permission of the Kennedy family.
[01:25:31.603 --> 01:25:36.965]  So he's saying the Kennedy family has to give permission to film at the Eternal Flame?
[01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:41.006]  Wasn't the Eternal Flame to burn eternally for all of us to see it?
[01:25:41.952 --> 01:25:44.714]  Take pictures of it and live with it?
[01:25:44.714 --> 01:25:53.199]  And then it goes on to say, additionally, Mr. Haas stated that you were denied in part because of the nature of your television program.
[01:25:53.199 --> 01:26:06.648]  Specifically, he stated the topic of your particular episode, which alleges the United States government was directly involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[01:26:07.808 --> 01:26:12.010]  Now, first of all, Alex, they didn't know what's in my show.
[01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:16.612]  My show hasn't aired yet, so they're simply assuming what's in there.
[01:26:16.612 --> 01:26:20.414]  And then they're denying me because of the content of the show.
[01:26:20.414 --> 01:26:23.856]  John Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, and if you don't go
[01:26:23.916 --> 01:26:29.341]  If you don't go along with the official story, you are not allowed to film at his eternal flame.
[01:26:29.341 --> 01:26:33.565]  I guess if you do go along with the official story, maybe then they'll let you.
[01:26:33.565 --> 01:26:35.046]  We didn't ask that.
[01:26:35.046 --> 01:26:36.988]  But again, his name is Ken Hawes.
[01:26:36.988 --> 01:26:38.990]  His phone number is 310-235-7621.
[01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.350]  Once again, 310-235-7621.
[01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:41.372]  And I'd love for all real Americans
[01:26:53.004 --> 01:27:02.097]  Well, Governor Jesse Ventura, if we don't hang together, we'll certainly hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[01:27:04.014 --> 01:27:10.118]  Separately on this issue, though, you said that Michelle Bachman, the Congresswoman from your state, is very upset about this.
[01:27:10.118 --> 01:27:17.362]  We need to have an investigation or, I mean, pretty soon the military will tell us how to wipe our noses.
[01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:22.785]  Exactly, and what's the military doing inside our country telling us things like that?
[01:27:22.785 --> 01:27:23.705]  The U.S.
[01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:27.527]  military is supposed to protect us, not from ourselves.
[01:27:27.527 --> 01:27:30.029]  They're supposed to protect us from foreign invasion.
[01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:32.885]  We're good to go.
[01:27:38.703 --> 01:27:40.344]  And your book covers a lot of this.
[01:27:40.344 --> 01:27:45.085]  It's so jam-packed, American Conspiracies, and incidentally, it's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:27:45.085 --> 01:27:49.747]  You can get a free film of your choice when you get the book, American Conspiracies, at InfoWars.com.
[01:27:49.747 --> 01:27:52.808]  It just covers basically all the key issues.
[01:27:52.808 --> 01:27:58.330]  I think it's Jesse Ventura's best book and is a New York Times Top Ten bestseller.
[01:27:58.330 --> 01:28:00.531]  We've only got about two minutes left, Gov.
[01:28:00.531 --> 01:28:07.514]  So much is happening, but it sounds like this second season is even more adventure and action-packed than the last one.
[01:28:07.834 --> 01:28:08.995]  I think it's going to be.
[01:28:08.995 --> 01:28:11.758]  It certainly is being more adventurous in doing it.
[01:28:11.758 --> 01:28:20.126]  I guess we were under the radar the first year we did it, but now it's aired on TV, so we've obviously gotten the attention of the United States government.
[01:28:20.126 --> 01:28:21.307]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:28:22.884 --> 01:28:25.265]  And what, eight to ten episodes this season?
[01:28:25.265 --> 01:28:27.366]  Yeah, eight for sure, and possibly ten.
[01:28:27.366 --> 01:28:29.047]  We're doing eight for sure.
[01:28:29.047 --> 01:28:44.714]  We've almost completed half of them now, so half of them are just about ready to go into the editing room and be put together into the final form, and then we got the other four to do before October, and it should be on the air, I'm guessing, around mid-October sometime.
[01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:47.783]  That is, Alex, unless Mr. Haas has something to say about it.
[01:28:47.783 --> 01:28:50.725]  I'm sure if they ask for his input, my show will be censored and not allowed on television.
[01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:51.126]  I don't know.
[01:28:51.126 --> 01:28:51.526]  You tell me.
[01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:56.129]  To me, they're overreaching their bounds dramatically, and this Ken Haas guy should be relieved of whatever his duty is.
[01:29:11.516 --> 01:29:14.617]  Well, we talked last time, a month or so ago, about an awakening.
[01:29:14.617 --> 01:29:20.318]  I am seeing an awakening, so I hope the pendulum starts really swinging against all this tyranny.
[01:29:20.318 --> 01:29:20.979]  Me too.
[01:29:20.979 --> 01:29:22.159]  Alex, I gotta run.
[01:29:22.159 --> 01:29:25.980]  You take care, and I'll keep in touch, and I'll let you know anything else that goes on.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:29.261]  Alright, Governor Jesse Ventura, thanks for keeping us abreast of the situation.
[01:29:29.261 --> 01:29:31.222]  Thanks for defending the First Amendment.
[01:29:31.222 --> 01:29:31.602]  Take care.
[01:29:31.602 --> 01:29:32.062]  Okay.
[01:29:32.062 --> 01:29:32.682]  Goodbye, Alex.
[01:29:33.042 --> 01:29:38.843]  All right, there goes Governor Jesse Ventura about to go do a big interview on his JFK investigation.
[01:29:38.843 --> 01:29:43.824]  We appreciate him contacting us and giving us this exclusive breakdown of what's going on with the production.
[01:29:43.824 --> 01:29:47.765]  There's a lot more happening behind the scenes, but I'm not at liberty to talk about it.
[01:29:47.765 --> 01:29:49.785]  But it'll be coming out on the TV show in the fall.
[01:29:49.785 --> 01:29:50.966]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.966 --> 01:29:52.366]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.366 --> 01:29:54.906]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.906 --> 01:29:57.587]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.503 --> 01:30:02.144]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:32:57.010 --> 01:33:02.836]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:33:02.836 --> 01:33:06.419]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:06.419 --> 01:33:10.564]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:27.958]  Well, my friends, for the next hour, joining us from Pakistan is Lieutenant General Hamid Gul.
[01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:36.403]  You've seen the mainstream media say that he's, quote, quarterbacking and commanding all the attacks on our forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[01:33:36.403 --> 01:33:39.285]  Of course, from my research, this is not the case.
[01:33:39.285 --> 01:33:46.229]  He was the big hero, the Pakistani general, the head of the ISI, who led the attacks against the Soviet invasion.
[01:33:47.370 --> 01:33:50.153]  Let me read over his bio, then he'll be with us for the next hour.
[01:34:03.328 --> 01:34:15.302]  During 72-76 he directly served under another top general as battalion commander when General Zia was the GOC 1st Armored Division and commander of the 2nd Corps.
[01:34:15.302 --> 01:34:22.089]  It goes on, Gould was promoted to Brigadier General in 1978 and steadily rose to be commander of the 1st Armored Division.
[01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:37.394]  In 1980, Gould was then sent to the GHQ as the DG Military Intelligence under a top general, who then nominated him as the ISI chief, succeeding another general in March of 1987.
[01:34:37.394 --> 01:34:44.677]  He was later replaced by ISI commander by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in May of 1989.
[01:34:44.677 --> 01:34:48.898]  He was then transferred to commander of the Second Corps.
[01:34:48.898 --> 01:34:50.899]  In this capacity, General Gould conducted the
[01:34:53.792 --> 01:35:03.939]  Zarb-e-Moham military exercise, November, December of 89, the biggest Pakistani armed forces show of muscle since 71, Indo-Pakistan war until now.
[01:35:03.939 --> 01:35:09.183]  So he's been a frontline commander and of course a general and the head of Pakistani intelligence.
[01:35:09.183 --> 01:35:10.504]  And I won't go any further.
[01:35:10.504 --> 01:35:15.107]  I've got a huge laundry list of things to talk about with the general.
[01:35:15.107 --> 01:35:21.332]  Two years ago when they had the Mumbai attacks, he came on the show and said the evidence shows it was staged by British-Israeli
[01:35:22.152 --> 01:35:23.533]  uh... and uh... u.s.
[01:35:23.533 --> 01:35:29.998]  intelligence it's now come out in the chicago tribune with the headline uh... that u.s.
[01:35:29.998 --> 01:35:50.492]  agent uh... was the head of that attack uh... the head of indian intelligence also said the west led the false flag attack to blame it on pakistan and to get pakistan and india fighting again that's how they play them off against each other uh... hameed ghul has also questioned the official story of nine eleven he's also going to give us his expert take
[01:35:51.352 --> 01:35:53.033]  On why the U.S.
[01:35:53.033 --> 01:35:56.675]  is, quote, failing in its war in Afghanistan.
[01:35:56.675 --> 01:35:59.697]  And he joins us now for a full hour.
[01:35:59.697 --> 01:36:02.839]  Lieutenant General Hamid Gul, thank you for joining us.
[01:36:02.839 --> 01:36:03.479]  And thank you.
[01:36:03.479 --> 01:36:06.581]  My greetings to all your audience, please.
[01:36:06.581 --> 01:36:11.064]  Why did you agree to come on this broadcast, General?
[01:36:11.064 --> 01:36:14.966]  Well, basically because my version is not going out to America.
[01:36:14.966 --> 01:36:17.428]  I have been denied the visa to travel to America.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:25.343]  And these people would not let me into America because they're afraid that I will speak the truth.
[01:36:25.343 --> 01:36:32.647]  People will listen to the truth, and then they will find out that these people have made a mess of the American plans.
[01:36:34.008 --> 01:36:37.011]  They are actually deceiving their own people.
[01:36:37.011 --> 01:36:38.953]  The American generals are failing.
[01:36:38.953 --> 01:36:41.896]  The American intelligence is a disaster.
[01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:42.637]  And they know that.
[01:36:42.637 --> 01:36:44.139]  I will speak in their idiom.
[01:36:44.139 --> 01:36:47.943]  And because I've worked with them, I've done my intelligence course.
[01:36:47.943 --> 01:36:51.967]  You did not mention it in my career record.
[01:36:52.667 --> 01:36:57.088]  I did an intelligence course in Okinawa when I was a captain under the U.S.
[01:36:57.088 --> 01:37:03.230]  Army, and I know exactly where the failings are, and they do not want it exposed.
[01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:09.432]  But lately, I was quite concerned because I was on Farid Zakaria's show, GPS.
[01:37:10.293 --> 01:37:11.354]  I think so.
[01:37:25.214 --> 01:37:28.795]  But he put out only six minutes of my version.
[01:37:28.795 --> 01:37:36.718]  So that is not fair, because I was informed, and especially the things that I said, which were stark realities.
[01:37:36.718 --> 01:37:48.643]  And he wanted, obviously, to keep the American people in the dark about these things, feelings which are going on in Afghanistan of the American policy, of the American
[01:37:50.227 --> 01:37:54.648]  Military generals, they are failing in every possible respect.
[01:37:54.648 --> 01:38:05.430]  This is my academic position, and I am prepared to face any general in America, any people in the academia, that, look, this is what is going wrong.
[01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:07.011]  I am a friend of American people.
[01:38:07.011 --> 01:38:12.072]  I criticize their policy, and they think that anyone who criticizes the policy is the enemy.
[01:38:12.452 --> 01:38:13.453]  This is totally wrong.
[01:38:13.453 --> 01:38:15.073]  This is a misperception.
[01:38:15.073 --> 01:38:16.954]  We work together with the CIA.
[01:38:16.954 --> 01:38:18.415]  We work together with the Americans.
[01:38:18.415 --> 01:38:20.296]  I have a lot of friends there.
[01:38:20.296 --> 01:38:21.837]  I respect them.
[01:38:21.837 --> 01:38:31.721]  And I could also—my advice could also be useful, even at this time, because nobody understands the Afghan society better than I do, because I've worked with them.
[01:38:31.721 --> 01:38:33.122]  I read their soul.
[01:38:33.122 --> 01:38:34.383]  I read their spirit.
[01:38:34.383 --> 01:38:36.704]  And I know I respect those people.
[01:38:36.704 --> 01:38:38.665]  I admire their courage and their valor.
[01:38:39.205 --> 01:38:40.846]  They have to be your friends.
[01:38:40.846 --> 01:38:41.927]  It's a period.
[01:38:41.927 --> 01:38:47.532]  I'm telling you, you cannot afford to lose Afghanistan as a friendly country.
[01:38:47.532 --> 01:38:59.681]  But unfortunately, the way things are going, if they are not handled properly, the future of Afghanistan would be hostile to America, which would neither be in the interest of Pakistan nor in the interest of America and its allies.
[01:38:59.941 --> 01:39:19.193]  But, General, it would be in the interest of the global crime syndicate known as the New World Order that wants to bring order out of chaos, that wants to create crises, that wants to destabilize Pakistan and Afghanistan and ship hundreds of billions of dollars of opium out a year to the streets of America.
[01:39:19.193 --> 01:39:26.958]  They think we're so stupid, they admit on Fox News that our troops help grow the opium in Afghanistan now.
[01:39:26.958 --> 01:39:28.579]  So, the reasons we're there
[01:39:29.139 --> 01:39:34.881]  We're publicly told one thing, but we're actually there for another reason, destabilization.
[01:39:34.881 --> 01:39:40.442]  I want you to speak to that and see if you agree, but first, you are live, uncensored.
[01:39:40.442 --> 01:39:48.044]  What do you want to tell the American people on more than 80 AM and FM radio stations and the number one internet radio show in the world?
[01:39:48.044 --> 01:39:53.265]  What do you want to tell the world about what's really happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan?
[01:39:53.265 --> 01:39:54.606]  Because just three weeks ago,
[01:39:55.626 --> 01:40:11.900]  They finally admitted that they have been lying and that US advisors, troops, and mercenaries, Blackwater and others, have been operating illegally inside Pakistan in what I have analyzed to be a destabilization campaign.
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:13.622]  What's really going on over there, General?
[01:40:14.713 --> 01:40:28.013]  Well, we know that Blackwater, now operating under the title of Z Worldwide Services, and NCORP, which is another such organization, they are called the security contractors.
[01:40:28.013 --> 01:40:29.955]  This is a fundamental fault.
[01:40:30.536 --> 01:40:40.722]  There are 105,000 security contractors, the troopers of the security contractors, operating in Afghanistan alone.
[01:40:40.722 --> 01:40:43.004]  And I guess there are no figures available.
[01:40:43.004 --> 01:40:46.626]  I think no less than 2,000 are operating inside Pakistan.
[01:40:47.286 --> 01:41:09.855]  No, this is something which ought never have to be done, because the reason is that the professional armies, when they start engaging the services of civilians, whose motivation is none other than making money and cashing dollars, then you can expect the kind of result that the Americans are getting.
[01:41:09.855 --> 01:41:14.437]  And American people, the taxpayers, they have to shuck out a lot of money.
[01:41:14.437 --> 01:41:16.438]  A lot of American blood is going to waste.
[01:41:17.018 --> 01:41:24.086]  No, all this is a disaster, because you—and now the latest one is the WikiLeaks.
[01:41:24.086 --> 01:41:32.154]  In this, again, all the compilation that they have been doing, on which they have been basing their plans, I tell you, it's a disaster.
[01:41:32.154 --> 01:41:33.616]  It's an intelligence disaster.
[01:41:34.583 --> 01:41:35.023]  Why?
[01:41:35.023 --> 01:41:43.325]  Because they have a heavily dependent—they have depended on the security contractors for even intelligence gathering.
[01:41:43.325 --> 01:41:47.086]  Now, imagine, how can they be such foolish people?
[01:41:47.086 --> 01:41:59.168]  I mean, the CIA, the FBI and all the other, and the—to top it all, there is this Task Force 373, which has been indulging in massive civilian
[01:41:59.708 --> 01:42:00.289]  I think so.
[01:42:14.884 --> 01:42:28.528]  So, can you imagine that the intelligence based on the information provided by security contractors has resulted in this massive violation of human rights?
[01:42:28.528 --> 01:42:31.129]  It has been anti-humanity.
[01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:37.131]  It has destroyed everything that American people and American constitution ever stood for.
[01:42:37.831 --> 01:42:46.763]  It has defied the spirit of the original Charter of American Constitution and Human Rights Charter.
[01:42:46.763 --> 01:42:54.313]  Everything that you hold so dear to your heart, the American people, they have violated it here in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:42:54.864 --> 01:42:56.725]  General, let me go back to something you said.
[01:42:56.725 --> 01:42:58.805]  I'm going to put it in layman terms.
[01:42:58.805 --> 01:43:08.929]  You have tens of billions of dollars in no-bid contracts going to DynCorp, going to XZ, formerly Blackwater, Blackwater Worldwide.
[01:43:08.929 --> 01:43:14.791]  They have an incentive to want the wars to continue and to be expanded.
[01:43:15.191 --> 01:43:17.892]  Because they're making billions of dollars out of it.
[01:43:17.892 --> 01:43:22.313]  So of course they're going to give intelligence to blame Pakistan and widen the war.
[01:43:22.313 --> 01:43:32.336]  Of course they're going to give intelligence that targets civilians knowing that there is the honor code in Pakistan and Afghanistan just like there was in the past.
[01:43:32.836 --> 01:43:44.489]  Here in America, before we lost our souls to a certain extent, that if you kill somebody's wife or children, they are going to kill you or die trying to kill you with this blood-honored debt.
[01:43:44.489 --> 01:43:47.152]  That's why they continue, and now they admit to have the CIA...
[01:43:48.513 --> 01:44:16.762]  and the Army, piloting drones from Virginia, and they are killing quote, in fact guys search this term, no name terrorist, if someone has a gun, when everybody has guns over there, you know, so called free country like America used to be, and they are killing innocent people, knowing it's going to stir them up and make them mad, so they fight back, then they can call them terrorist, then they can expand the war, then the contractors can make more money.
[01:44:18.615 --> 01:44:19.696]  Precisely, Alex.
[01:44:19.696 --> 01:44:27.263]  This is exactly—you have painted it so beautifully and so vividly, there could not be a better explanation.
[01:44:27.263 --> 01:44:32.508]  This honor code is as old as the Afon Society itself.
[01:44:32.508 --> 01:44:38.113]  I mean, it runs through their blood for the past 5,000 years.
[01:44:38.113 --> 01:44:39.915]  And this is called Pakhtoonwali.
[01:44:39.915 --> 01:44:41.677]  Pakhtoonwali is an honor code.
[01:44:42.177 --> 01:44:47.019]  This evokes even stronger sentiments than the religion.
[01:44:47.019 --> 01:44:51.820]  Therefore, these people are not going to forgive all this.
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:56.922]  And I am afraid that we will have lost this region forever to America, to the West.
[01:44:57.422 --> 01:44:58.864]  And this will not be good for us.
[01:44:58.864 --> 01:44:59.744]  I agree.
[01:44:59.744 --> 01:45:13.437]  I think it is still time that we redress the situation and some senses driven into the heads which seem to be totally blocked to or impervious to any kind of sensible suggestion.
[01:45:13.437 --> 01:45:15.198]  But I think we must keep on trying.
[01:45:15.198 --> 01:45:21.284]  I think this is the last lap in which we are now going, and this struggle is going to end
[01:45:21.984 --> 01:45:27.767]  We're in a very big disaster for American reputation, for their honor, for their self-respect.
[01:45:27.767 --> 01:45:29.688]  And we don't want to have this done.
[01:45:29.688 --> 01:45:36.372]  I can assure you, I genuinely am telling this, because American people are such noble people.
[01:45:36.372 --> 01:45:43.676]  Sometimes I say they are so gullible and they are so innocent that this borders on being criminally innocent.
[01:45:44.296 --> 01:45:45.678]  Well, I don't know.
[01:46:02.401 --> 01:46:06.625]  Well, General, as you know, this is the divide and conquer British model.
[01:46:06.625 --> 01:46:23.279]  You had Mohamed Mozadek, somewhat secular, pro-Western, but he wanted to build up Iran and keep some of their own money, so they used radical Muslims to overthrow him, then they put the Shah in and double-crossed the Muslims.
[01:46:23.279 --> 01:46:24.921]  Then, the same thing with the Serbs.
[01:46:25.441 --> 01:46:25.661]  I don't
[01:46:48.308 --> 01:46:50.591]  So there is a rhyme and reason to this.
[01:46:50.591 --> 01:46:57.858]  It's just so cold-blooded and so evil, the average person cannot grasp it.
[01:46:57.858 --> 01:46:59.760]  Yeah, that's right, Alex.
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:07.488]  I think America, American policy makers have, for their own reason, I don't know, I have not been able to fathom that as yet.
[01:47:08.385 --> 01:47:21.288]  But they have allowed the old British, what would we say, mischievous mind to lead American policymaking by the nose.
[01:47:21.288 --> 01:47:23.769]  And I can tell you, I know them.
[01:47:23.769 --> 01:47:24.869]  I worked with them.
[01:47:24.869 --> 01:47:29.810]  I did my staff course there in Camberley in the U.K., and I know them inside out.
[01:47:30.575 --> 01:47:33.037]  They are extremely jealous of America.
[01:47:33.037 --> 01:47:35.698]  They do not want to see America flourish.
[01:47:35.698 --> 01:47:39.160]  Inside their heart, they don't—they want to pull their leg.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.502]  They make a fool of them, and they talk about it.
[01:47:42.502 --> 01:47:47.345]  They have coined jokes for the Americans.
[01:47:47.345 --> 01:47:51.548]  So, this is—this has to be done away with.
[01:47:51.548 --> 01:47:52.969]  That is fundamental.
[01:47:52.969 --> 01:47:58.332]  The other power, which for its own reason, and those are very mischievous reasons,
[01:47:58.732 --> 01:47:59.832]  That is Israel.
[01:47:59.832 --> 01:48:03.593]  And Israel now is joined in by the Indians, unfortunately.
[01:48:03.593 --> 01:48:06.594]  So, together, they formed the club.
[01:48:06.594 --> 01:48:12.176]  That club, you can call it the extra or ultra-imperial club.
[01:48:12.176 --> 01:48:16.937]  This imperial club is responsible for a lot of problems in the world.
[01:48:16.937 --> 01:48:18.978]  And American people are exploited.
[01:48:18.978 --> 01:48:21.639]  They are the most innocent people on God's Earth.
[01:48:22.219 --> 01:48:32.749]  But they are exploited to the hilt for that implementation of their dark impulse and their dark agenda, which is only a handful of people.
[01:48:32.749 --> 01:48:38.275]  There is a clique only, in my assessment, who are indulging in this exercise.
[01:48:38.959 --> 01:48:40.861]  General, let's get into WikiLeaks.
[01:48:40.861 --> 01:48:54.252]  I noticed day one that what the media focused on out of 90 plus thousand documents were documents, battlefield reports, as you said, fed by private contractors, classically unreliable, completely unreliable.
[01:48:54.252 --> 01:48:57.474]  It's like going to the devil, you know, for the truth.
[01:48:57.474 --> 01:48:59.516]  And it all points at Pakistan.
[01:48:59.516 --> 01:49:01.097]  It all points at you.
[01:49:01.097 --> 01:49:03.859]  It says that Hamid Gul, here's the quote,
[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.641]  This is diabolical nonsense.
[01:49:06.641 --> 01:49:19.104]  And if this is the kind of intelligence that America is basing its policies on in this region, then God help America.
[01:49:26.716 --> 01:49:28.659]  Because this is totally false.
[01:49:28.659 --> 01:49:29.860]  It's fabricated.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:33.365]  And I tell you, who are the elements involved in it?
[01:49:33.365 --> 01:49:34.887]  One, the Afghan intelligence.
[01:49:34.887 --> 01:49:43.139]  And good luck that Amarullah Saleh, who was an old communist, who was heading the intelligence setup of Afghanistan,
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:51.407]  And the intelligence service there in Afghanistan is still infested by the old communist diehard.
[01:49:51.407 --> 01:50:01.978]  And they have an axe to grind, especially against me as a person, because I was responsible in part for their ouster from Afghanistan, from their ouster from power.
[01:50:02.842 --> 01:50:08.565]  Then the Indians have joined up with them, and they also have things to settle with Pakistan.
[01:50:08.565 --> 01:50:10.306]  They want to destabilize Pakistan.
[01:50:10.306 --> 01:50:16.510]  They're sitting on our map, back under the shadow of America, and they're stabbing Pakistan.
[01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:23.914]  An ally, a friend of America—we have been friends not now, but we have been friends right through the days of Cold War.
[01:50:23.914 --> 01:50:29.637]  Ever since Mr. Dulles, Foster Dulles, he framed the policy of befriending Pakistan.
[01:50:30.177 --> 01:50:37.966]  We have been a very loyal friend of America, and we have given huge sacrifices to uphold that friendship.
[01:50:37.966 --> 01:50:46.436]  But, unfortunately, the Indians would have us put down completely, and they would want Pakistan to be subservient to India.
[01:50:46.436 --> 01:50:49.180]  This is not acceptable to people of Pakistan.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:51:00.713]  Now, this is how Wikileaks has been giving—of course, there are only 180 reports with regard to Pakistan and my person.
[01:51:00.713 --> 01:51:02.215]  Eight times I've been mentioned in this.
[01:51:03.092 --> 01:51:23.935]  But I said to the CNN also, for heaven's sake, if you think that a 74-year-old general retired some 18 and a half years ago from the army and left ISI 21 years ago, if he's still responsible for defeating America in Afghanistan, which is inevitable, because America is now
[01:51:24.635 --> 01:51:25.076]  I think so.
[01:51:35.934 --> 01:51:40.376]  They are going to record it in history, in the history books.
[01:51:40.376 --> 01:51:43.637]  What are the American future generation going to read?
[01:51:43.637 --> 01:51:56.382]  That the mightiest power ever in the history of mankind was defeated with the help of a retired 74-year-old general living in his house, a retired life?
[01:51:56.382 --> 01:51:57.622]  I mean, this would be shameful.
[01:51:57.622 --> 01:51:58.963]  They would be ashamed of it.
[01:51:58.963 --> 01:52:01.804]  Let the future generation not be ashamed.
[01:52:02.504 --> 01:52:04.565]  Speak the truth that you have failed.
[01:52:04.565 --> 01:52:11.129]  You have failed because your own policy makers have not come up with the recipes that were required.
[01:52:11.129 --> 01:52:15.311]  Your own generals would not measure up to the task that was given to them.
[01:52:15.311 --> 01:52:27.217]  So why don't you accept the failure rather than rub the blame on somebody else and start finding scapegoats and those two scapegoats, which would not sell in the market.
[01:52:27.217 --> 01:52:28.238]  Please, for God's sake.
[01:52:29.018 --> 01:52:40.444]  As far as I am concerned, I can tell you, my future generation will be proud that he was responsible not only in defeat of one superpower, but in defeat of another superpower also.
[01:52:40.444 --> 01:52:41.465]  But that's not the case.
[01:52:41.465 --> 01:52:43.866]  I don't want America to be defeated there.
[01:52:43.866 --> 01:52:46.508]  I want them to exit Afghanistan gracefully.
[01:52:46.508 --> 01:52:52.511]  I don't want them to get involved into a running fight in Afghanistan like they did in Vietnam.
[01:52:52.511 --> 01:52:54.412]  Why don't they learn their lesson?
[01:52:54.412 --> 01:52:57.794]  And in Vietnam also, it's not too far back in history.
[01:52:58.294 --> 01:52:58.855]  I think so.
[01:53:14.558 --> 01:53:15.479]  And what did you do?
[01:53:15.479 --> 01:53:18.880]  I mean, they ran out from Vietnam.
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:21.261]  Why could they not have thought of it earlier on?
[01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:25.663]  And similar situation now confronts them in Afghanistan.
[01:53:25.663 --> 01:53:29.865]  So, from my point of view, being a friend of America, I won't.
[01:53:30.405 --> 01:53:31.385]  The way they are going, I think
[01:53:58.730 --> 01:54:02.952]  There will be no option left but to cut and run out of Afghanistan.
[01:54:19.398 --> 01:54:31.506]  Just a few weeks after that tragic event and you fingered Western intelligence for staging it to stir up enmity between India and Pakistan and as a pretext to bring U.S.
[01:54:31.506 --> 01:54:33.808]  forces covertly into Pakistan.
[01:54:33.808 --> 01:54:35.329]  We now know that was the case.
[01:54:35.329 --> 01:54:45.075]  I want to show viewers mainstream news here in the United States, including the Chicago Tribune and others admitting that, quote, the head of that attack was a U.S.
[01:54:45.075 --> 01:54:48.377]  agent and explain to people why they do this.
[01:54:48.377 --> 01:54:49.058]  And but
[01:54:49.898 --> 01:54:56.824]  First, let's get into a basic boil down from your military expertise and expert on the region.
[01:54:56.824 --> 01:55:08.012]  What the real policy, what the real objective has been by the United States being used by these globalists inside your country and bordering Afghanistan.
[01:55:09.173 --> 01:55:10.074]  Yeah, nine years of occupation now.
[01:55:10.074 --> 01:55:14.537]  Nine years of this dirty war which has been going on for a wrong purpose, at a wrong time, in a wrong place.
[01:55:32.230 --> 01:55:40.921]  Now, what is the real—the declared or the stated goal of the war was to disperse al-Qaeda to catch Osama bin Laden.
[01:55:40.921 --> 01:55:46.989]  And now, lately, President Obama has come up with a new formulation, and that says that
[01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:51.612]  That we have to reverse the momentum of Taliban.
[01:55:51.612 --> 01:55:53.454]  And who are Taliban?
[01:55:53.454 --> 01:55:55.835]  Taliban are resistance fighters.
[01:55:55.835 --> 01:55:57.536]  They are the Mujahideen of the old.
[01:55:57.536 --> 01:56:04.941]  I mean, they are the same people, or their sons and daughters, who fought against the Soviet Union.
[01:56:04.941 --> 01:56:10.304]  And they are fighting for the same reason as they were fighting against Soviet Union at that time.
[01:56:10.304 --> 01:56:11.625]  What is that reason?
[01:56:11.625 --> 01:56:14.487]  That reason is to protect their way of life.
[01:56:15.047 --> 01:56:25.809]  Whatever it is, you may not agree with that way of life, but the point is, as you are jealous of protecting your way of life, they are jealous of protecting their way of life.
[01:56:25.809 --> 01:56:37.191]  The other is liberation, because they look upon the Americans and the Allied forces as the occupation forces, and so they want to liberate.
[01:56:37.191 --> 01:56:40.172]  They will not settle for anything less than that.
[01:56:40.172 --> 01:56:42.492]  So really, you are fighting the Afghan nation.
[01:56:43.133 --> 01:56:46.331]  Do you want to reverse the momentum of the Afghan nation?
[01:56:47.362 --> 01:56:49.083]  Is it achievable?
[01:56:49.083 --> 01:56:50.984]  In my opinion, it is not achievable.
[01:56:50.984 --> 01:56:52.285]  It is not worth it.
[01:56:52.285 --> 01:56:54.586]  It is, first of all, it is not proper.
[01:56:54.586 --> 01:57:07.454]  It is not morally correct that you should be trying to state-jacket a nation, and a nation as proud as the Afghans, in certain mold that you have visualized for them.
[01:57:07.454 --> 01:57:11.657]  This is immoral, this is incorrect, and it is not achievable.
[01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:15.079]  So the real aim, the hidden aim, the latent aim,
[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.602]  I have been saying that before also.
[01:57:19.602 --> 01:57:37.451]  That was basically, A, for corporate America to install itself within the center of the oil-rich area, the resources of the Caspian Sea Basin area, resources of the Middle East.
[01:57:38.112 --> 01:57:41.273]  B, to check China from moving into this region.
[01:57:41.273 --> 01:57:43.834]  That is the strategic aim.
[01:57:43.834 --> 01:57:51.677]  And C, to any new system should not emerge, because they are afraid that their system is a failure.
[01:57:51.677 --> 01:58:06.602]  And if any new system, based on Islamic principles of egalitarianism, equality, fraternity and freedom, if these principles are really adopted, then imperial powers will have no place to hide.
[01:58:07.302 --> 01:58:11.503]  So, really, this was the second, third aim.
[01:58:11.503 --> 01:58:20.806]  And fourth one, unfortunately, and very unfortunate for America, is to provide a security shield to the state of Israel.
[01:58:20.806 --> 01:58:23.586]  And with that, they want to strengthen India.
[01:58:23.586 --> 01:58:35.490]  Now, imagine, a country as big, as powerful, as enlightened as America should be acting to provide security to somebody else.
[01:58:37.148 --> 01:58:38.270]  General Gould got a break.
[01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:39.492]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:39.492 --> 01:58:43.358]  Continue.

[01:58:54.753 --> 01:58:56.015]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.015 --> 01:58:59.959]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:59.959 --> 01:59:02.182]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.182 --> 01:59:08.049]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.049 --> 01:59:14.317]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.717 --> 01:59:20.658]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.658 --> 01:59:24.859]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:24.859 --> 01:59:29.160]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[01:59:35.101 --> 01:59:38.661]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.661 --> 01:59:40.622]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.622 --> 01:59:41.062]  It's here.

[01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:58.803]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:09.875]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.875 --> 02:00:11.457]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.457 --> 02:00:13.018]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.018 --> 02:00:17.202]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.202 --> 02:00:21.266]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.931 --> 02:00:31.934]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, for the last 30 minutes, retired Lieutenant General Hamid Gul has been our guest, former head of Pakistani intelligence.
[02:00:31.934 --> 02:00:39.758]  The Washington Post wrote, if the documents are to be believed, and the uncooperated U.S.
[02:00:39.758 --> 02:00:51.323]  intelligence reports must be read with caution, so they add that this is just battlefield reports fed by contractors, Gul has taken a direct hand in quarterbacking attacks
[02:00:52.466 --> 02:00:52.687]  I think?
[02:01:02.967 --> 02:01:04.588]  Who's told the truth.
[02:01:04.588 --> 02:01:08.131]  I mean, I don't trust anybody except my wife and children, and God.
[02:01:08.131 --> 02:01:18.259]  But I just go off long-term study, long-term looking at geopolitical systems, the British model of the great game that our country's adopted, how we're being used.
[02:01:18.259 --> 02:01:20.120]  I mean, for five years, U.S.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:32.210]  troops and contractors have been sneaking around in Afghanistan, excuse me, nine years there, in Pakistan, and now they came out three weeks ago and admitted, okay, we lied to you, we got contractors and troops there.
[02:01:33.090 --> 02:01:40.492]  And, you know, Google said two years ago on this show they were there to stir up the tribal areas to destabilize Pakistan.
[02:01:40.492 --> 02:01:42.133]  And now that's admitted.
[02:01:42.133 --> 02:01:49.755]  I mean, these global corporations that suck us dry with these wars, they have a motive to expand these wars.
[02:01:49.755 --> 02:01:53.056]  So, this is a short segment, General, but brief answers on this.
[02:01:53.056 --> 02:01:55.237]  Finishing up on Israel and the U.S.
[02:01:55.237 --> 02:01:58.698]  being used as a tool that you were talking about there, and then
[02:01:59.378 --> 02:02:09.006]  Well, let me tell you that there is everything to be gained by pulling out and there is everything to be lost by continuing to stay here.
[02:02:09.006 --> 02:02:13.990]  So that's my judgment and I'm quite convinced that this is right.
[02:02:23.937 --> 02:02:37.330]  Now, by pulling out, you are going to, because there is a natural affinity between America and Pakistan and America and even Afghanistan because, you know, they have cooperated in the past throughout.
[02:02:37.330 --> 02:02:38.752]  We have a long history of cooperation.
[02:02:39.572 --> 02:02:41.395]  When India was in the U.S.S.R.
[02:02:41.395 --> 02:02:46.561]  camp, Pakistan was all along, and Afghanistan too, was in the American camp.
[02:02:46.561 --> 02:02:50.145]  Afghanistan made a mistake of being in the U.S.S.R.
[02:02:50.145 --> 02:02:51.246]  camp, and U.S.S.R.
[02:02:51.246 --> 02:02:54.410]  came and attacked it at that time, and of course they resisted.
[02:02:55.050 --> 02:02:55.371]  I think?
[02:03:13.050 --> 02:03:16.411]  Go for a hearing before the Senate or the Congress.
[02:03:16.411 --> 02:03:18.751]  Whatever you want me to do, I am prepared.
[02:03:18.751 --> 02:03:29.113]  If I'm a terrorist, if I'm quarterbacking, as you rightly said, these attacks in Afghanistan, then you can catch me.
[02:03:29.113 --> 02:03:32.474]  I mean, here is a terrorist who is offering himself.
[02:03:32.474 --> 02:03:33.874]  He says, OK, catch me.
[02:03:33.874 --> 02:03:36.035]  Hold me responsible.
[02:03:36.035 --> 02:03:40.936]  Take me anywhere, to Congress, to any court, to any interrogation center.
[02:03:40.936 --> 02:03:41.956]  I'm prepared for all this.
[02:03:43.487 --> 02:03:44.328]  They are lying.
[02:03:44.328 --> 02:03:48.491]  I tell you, they are lying to the American people more than anyone else.
[02:03:48.491 --> 02:03:55.718]  And if they have a change of heart, we will find ways and means when they can pull out safely.
[02:03:55.718 --> 02:03:57.339]  They will not be followed.
[02:03:57.339 --> 02:04:11.031]  Now, the speech that President Obama made on 8th of May 2009 in Cairo, addressing the Al-Azhar University, I think that was remarkable, because in this he had said,
[02:04:11.791 --> 02:04:24.441]  If there is no chance of attack or there is no threat of attack from that region to America, then in that case, we are prepared to pull out every single troop from that region.
[02:04:24.441 --> 02:04:31.807]  And I, at that time, also on some of the TV channels, I said that this is a legitimate demand.
[02:04:31.807 --> 02:04:32.908]  OK, we accept this.
[02:04:33.695 --> 02:04:35.437]  General, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[02:04:35.437 --> 02:04:36.818]  We've got to go to break.
[02:04:36.818 --> 02:04:38.820]  Come back and repeat that thought and finish it up.
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.583]  We'll be right back with General Hamid Gul.
[02:05:00.717 --> 02:05:04.903]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:05:04.903 --> 02:05:11.331]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:05:11.331 --> 02:05:15.657]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much
[02:05:15.657 --> 02:05:16.057]  I think so.
[02:05:36.485 --> 02:05:43.251]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:05:43.251 --> 02:05:47.154]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:05:47.154 --> 02:05:53.519]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:05:53.519 --> 02:05:54.320]  Thank you.
[02:06:02.315 --> 02:06:06.276]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:06.276 --> 02:06:15.139]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:15.139 --> 02:06:19.780]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:30.584]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:31.224 --> 02:06:40.726]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:40.726 --> 02:06:46.168]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:46.168 --> 02:06:53.649]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:53.649 --> 02:06:56.410]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:07:00.148 --> 02:07:04.691]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.691 --> 02:07:05.612]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.612 --> 02:07:09.035]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.035 --> 02:07:09.895]  Number 2.
[02:07:09.895 --> 02:07:14.779]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.779 --> 02:07:15.539]  It's true.
[02:07:15.539 --> 02:07:20.403]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.403 --> 02:07:21.224]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.224 --> 02:07:24.826]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.826 --> 02:07:28.509]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:29.509]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.509 --> 02:07:32.270]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:35.951]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:35.951 --> 02:07:36.731]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.731 --> 02:07:40.893]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.893 --> 02:07:45.634]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:45.934 --> 02:07:50.118]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.118 --> 02:07:51.900]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:54.162]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.162 --> 02:07:56.764]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:56.764 --> 02:08:04.091]  ...at your own risk.
[02:08:04.091 --> 02:08:06.253]  Because it leads to the future.
[02:08:06.253 --> 02:08:08.595]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:08:08.595 --> 02:08:10.617]  This is not a new world.
[02:08:11.957 --> 02:08:16.360]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:23.844]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:08:23.844 --> 02:08:32.829]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[02:08:32.829 --> 02:08:38.552]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[02:08:38.552 --> 02:08:40.834]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[02:08:50.478 --> 02:08:52.399]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:52.399 --> 02:09:04.022]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:04.022 --> 02:09:13.545]  Well, we've been talking to Lieutenant General Hamid Gul about a host of really important issues, and he's joining us from Pakistan.
[02:09:16.826 --> 02:09:26.895]  Last time we had him on, the regular phone number was being blocked and we were having trouble getting through on the other line.
[02:09:26.895 --> 02:09:31.199]  And it looks like we may be having some phone troubles now.
[02:09:31.199 --> 02:09:33.581]  We may try to reconnect with him in a moment.
[02:09:33.581 --> 02:09:37.084]  General, do we have you?
[02:09:37.084 --> 02:09:43.130]  Now again, I have researched all of this information in depth.
[02:09:44.577 --> 02:10:03.702]  And we've had the former CIA commander for the entire Afghan war on who wrote the book Jawbreaker and he admitted that they would pick up 12, 13, 14, 15 year old kids and would send them to Guantanamo Bay as terrorists knowing they were totally innocent just to create this illusion.
[02:10:03.702 --> 02:10:12.545]  It's a manufactured war as a pretext to feed our troops into a meat grinder as a giant laboratory
[02:10:13.650 --> 02:10:13.850]  I think?
[02:10:26.335 --> 02:10:34.860]  At all of the information concerned here and clearly the Pentagon plan is to expand the war into Pakistan.
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.381]  They now admit that U.S.
[02:10:36.381 --> 02:10:40.003]  forces and contractors are there illegally.
[02:10:40.003 --> 02:10:42.125]  Congress had been lied to about this.
[02:10:42.125 --> 02:10:47.248]  Where is all this leading and what are the Western forces doing in Pakistan?
[02:10:48.533 --> 02:10:57.560]  Well, they are on sabotage, subversion mission, and inciting people to rise against the central government of Pakistan.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:06.767]  So, they are on destabilizing exercise, not realizing that this is going to hurt them more than it is going to hurt us, because we are, in any case, suffering.
[02:11:06.767 --> 02:11:11.010]  There is a state of flood at the moment we are facing in Pakistan.
[02:11:11.010 --> 02:11:14.533]  It's a great human tragedy that we are in the middle of it.
[02:11:15.562 --> 02:11:29.652]  And on top of it, our friends America and their allies, some of their allies, and India, they are in collusion to bash Pakistan and to really unravel it from inside.
[02:11:29.652 --> 02:11:34.235]  But this is very unfair, and I don't think they will be able to do it at the end of the day.
[02:11:34.235 --> 02:11:40.780]  I think if they get embroiled in Pakistan, then they will keep on staying here for a very long time.
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:44.663]  And I don't think the American people have a heart for it.
[02:11:44.663 --> 02:11:48.887]  I think 60% of Americans are already against this war.
[02:11:48.887 --> 02:12:00.118]  And if they're going to expand this war, because I know one thing, the irregular fight that is going to be put up to Americans, whether in Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Iran, now the
[02:12:03.334 --> 02:12:13.005]  Larger the area of conflict and longer the period of conflict, the established power, the one who is equipped with more firepower, cannot win.
[02:12:13.005 --> 02:12:16.148]  This is a lesson from history.
[02:12:16.148 --> 02:12:18.170]  And it is immutable.
[02:12:18.170 --> 02:12:20.613]  Because if they enlarge the area of conflict,
[02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:21.494]  General Ghul.
[02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:43.992]  Where is this leading if the United States doesn't pull out?
[02:12:43.992 --> 02:12:52.017]  Clearly our government, controlled by these offshore corporate interests, wants to expand this into Pakistan with this destabilization.
[02:12:52.017 --> 02:12:58.361]  From your research, how many contractors are sneaking around in your country versus regular U.S.
[02:12:58.361 --> 02:12:58.761]  forces?
[02:12:59.704 --> 02:13:08.512]  Well, I think the security contractors, at this moment, they are trying to spread their wings into Balochistan area.
[02:13:08.512 --> 02:13:17.081]  And America has been granted permission, it is understood, to open, because they arm-twisted our government and our leaders.
[02:13:17.801 --> 02:13:18.101]  I think?
[02:13:47.901 --> 02:13:50.984]  And it's a long border with Iran.
[02:13:50.984 --> 02:13:55.308]  It is about 900 kilometers long border that we share with Iran.
[02:13:55.308 --> 02:14:12.664]  So it has twin purpose, A, to destabilize Pakistan, and B, to get inside Iran and try to destabilize them, because those areas are Sunni populated, and they are definitely trying to create a problem for Iran from that point.
[02:14:13.487 --> 02:14:22.437]  So, really, at this moment, I would put the figure of the security contractors to less than 5,000.
[02:14:22.437 --> 02:14:26.321]  I don't think they are more than this number.
[02:14:26.321 --> 02:14:34.410]  And they're trying to expand, because very recently, 650 visas were issued to American servicemen.
[02:14:35.170 --> 02:14:36.930]  So they're trying to turn him into...
[02:14:59.406 --> 02:15:08.435]  Exactly, trying to turn them into covert spies so they can't be differentiated between them, regular troops, and the different contractors.
[02:15:08.435 --> 02:15:10.578]  Speaking of Iran, General Ghoul.
[02:15:11.769 --> 02:15:21.793]  We continue to hear over and over again that Iran is funding insurgency in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[02:15:21.793 --> 02:15:28.696]  And many analysts, even here in the West, even many people in the CIA say that that's asinine, that that's a lie.
[02:15:28.696 --> 02:15:29.576]  What's the truth there?
[02:15:29.576 --> 02:15:31.897]  Oh, it's not a lie.
[02:15:31.897 --> 02:15:36.479]  Believe you me, Iran is not doing anything of this nature.
[02:15:36.479 --> 02:15:40.300]  But they would have us believe that Iran is our enemy.
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:41.081]  They're not our enemy.
[02:15:42.003 --> 02:15:45.827]  They have—there has been no hostility between Iran and Pakistan.
[02:15:45.827 --> 02:15:47.169]  That border is quiet.
[02:15:47.169 --> 02:15:51.854]  There is absolutely peaceful movement of goods and people on that border.
[02:15:51.854 --> 02:15:54.317]  So, this is not a lie.
[02:15:54.317 --> 02:15:56.760]  It's only to malign Iran.
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:57.561]  But I tell you,
[02:15:58.610 --> 02:16:07.599]  Israel is hell-bent to draw America into a wider war by attacking Iran.
[02:16:07.599 --> 02:16:13.625]  If they go in for unilaterally to attack some target, even drop a few bombs here and there,
[02:16:14.325 --> 02:16:18.470]  I think it will flare up a conflict that they will not be able to control.
[02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:21.553]  And America is likely to get sucked into this war.
[02:16:21.553 --> 02:16:24.576]  And this may turn out to be the third world war.
[02:16:24.576 --> 02:16:27.059]  It will be a disaster of the first order.
[02:16:27.059 --> 02:16:29.121]  I think it must be avoided at all costs.
[02:16:29.585 --> 02:16:43.403]  Well, General Gould, it's not just you, a formidable intelligence and military expert who's worked at every level from ground commander up to major general right through here, but dealing with this,
[02:16:44.665 --> 02:16:52.430]  The word that I get from Ray McGovern, high-level CIA analysts, retired and others, is that they're looking at green-lighting it this month.
[02:16:52.430 --> 02:16:57.973]  They may attack, Israel may attack, in the next 15 days or even sooner.
[02:16:57.973 --> 02:17:05.458]  We are on the edge of what most even Western analysts say, and the Russians agree, could lead to World War III.
[02:17:07.068 --> 02:17:08.229]  Yes, I agree with you.
[02:17:08.229 --> 02:17:10.851]  I have said that independently.
[02:17:10.851 --> 02:17:20.899]  I didn't have this information that you have, but all the same, I think my calculation as a strategist and as an intelligence expert is that this would be a disaster.
[02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:25.662]  I don't think that Russia can be kept back, or China for that matter.
[02:17:25.662 --> 02:17:32.487]  I don't know which of all other countries will get sucked into this imbroglio, and this will be an inferno that will consume
[02:17:33.548 --> 02:17:34.948]  So many things.
[02:17:34.948 --> 02:17:37.389]  And corporate America would be the biggest sufferer.
[02:17:37.389 --> 02:17:38.909]  They don't realize this.
[02:17:38.909 --> 02:17:46.811]  Because if it results eventually in destabilization of the entire region, where are they going to sell their goods?
[02:17:46.811 --> 02:17:48.532]  And how are they going to pick up the oil?
[02:17:48.532 --> 02:17:53.413]  And especially the European countries will be the biggest sufferer.
[02:17:53.413 --> 02:17:55.313]  And Japanese economy will collapse.
[02:17:55.313 --> 02:17:56.433]  So many things will happen.
[02:17:56.433 --> 02:17:59.014]  You can't simply say it's incalculable at this time.
[02:18:00.051 --> 02:18:03.732]  By the way, that's what literally hundreds of top Western analysts are saying.
[02:18:03.732 --> 02:18:06.113]  They confer with General Hamid Gul.
[02:18:06.113 --> 02:18:10.555]  General, we're running out of time, and we've got one more segment coming up.
[02:18:10.555 --> 02:18:14.276]  I may try to keep you a bit longer, but I wanted to get into some other issues.
[02:18:14.276 --> 02:18:16.457]  We're also simulcasting on television.
[02:18:16.457 --> 02:18:19.018]  If I can have a document cam shot right here.
[02:18:19.018 --> 02:18:22.639]  Evidence, Mumbai attackers were Anglo-American intel operatives.
[02:18:22.639 --> 02:18:27.841]  That's Kurt Nemo in November of 2008 about the Mumbai attacks.
[02:18:27.841 --> 02:18:28.701]  Now we have
[02:18:29.261 --> 02:18:36.809]  December of last year, Times of London, Mumbai terror suspect David Headley was rogue U.S.
[02:18:36.809 --> 02:18:37.510]  agent.
[02:18:37.510 --> 02:18:41.835]  The Chicago Tribune went on to report he was the commander of the operation.
[02:18:41.835 --> 02:18:48.462]  The head of Indian counterterrorism said it was a Western op, but they killed him that day to shut him up.
[02:18:49.482 --> 02:18:50.063]  Here's another one.
[02:18:50.063 --> 02:18:53.806]  Chicago man charged in 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.
[02:18:53.806 --> 02:18:54.947]  Intelligence connection.
[02:18:54.947 --> 02:19:01.492]  So how did you know two years ago, day one, that this was a Western op that they tried to blame on you and Pakistan?
[02:19:02.731 --> 02:19:11.656]  Well, I have an uncanny sixth sense about this because of my experience, because of the fact that I've worked with the CIA and I know how their mind works.
[02:19:11.656 --> 02:19:12.876]  I can read their mind.
[02:19:12.876 --> 02:19:24.703]  For instance, I had said that this 9-11 attack was because of the internal cavity inside America itself.
[02:19:25.774 --> 02:19:30.297]  To date, they have not been able to come up with a charge sheet against Osama Bin Laden.
[02:19:30.297 --> 02:19:34.200]  He should have been tried in absentia if they had enough evidence on him.
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:35.841]  Why have they not tried him in absentia?
[02:19:56.497 --> 02:19:59.007]  Stay there, General Hamid Ghul, our guest.
[02:19:59.007 --> 02:19:59.670]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.306 --> 02:20:03.928]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[02:20:03.928 --> 02:20:12.754]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[02:20:12.754 --> 02:20:25.223]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[02:20:25.223 --> 02:20:26.124]  But don't wait!
[02:20:26.124 --> 02:20:29.106]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[02:20:29.206 --> 02:20:29.546]  I think so.
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.881]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[02:20:48.881 --> 02:20:50.781]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[02:20:50.781 --> 02:20:50.861]  800-876-2966.
[02:20:50.861 --> 02:20:51.041]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[02:20:51.041 --> 02:20:51.802]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:51.802 --> 02:20:53.042]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:53.042 --> 02:20:54.242]  Gun sales are on a staggering

[02:22:50.904 --> 02:22:51.804]  fallofamerica.net
[02:23:00.825 --> 02:23:02.046]  Attention to all U.S.
[02:23:02.046 --> 02:23:10.011]  drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles with an auto warranty about to expire or no warranty coverage at all.
[02:23:10.011 --> 02:23:16.075]  Due to our country's economic crisis and auto repair costs on the rise, if your vehicle has less than 130,000 miles, as of today,
[02:23:18.416 --> 02:23:28.681]  You could be one of the millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle covered under United Repair Plans and have 100% of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you.
[02:23:28.681 --> 02:23:33.364]  This low-cost vehicle service contract has been established under United Repair Plans.
[02:23:33.604 --> 02:23:40.669]  And is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession.
[02:23:40.669 --> 02:23:49.375]  If you own a vehicle with less than 130,000 miles, you may now call to see if your vehicle qualifies and for a free 5-minute quote.
[02:23:49.375 --> 02:23:50.296]  Number to call is 800-809-4491.
[02:23:50.296 --> 02:23:50.356]  800-809-4491.
[02:23:50.356 --> 02:23:50.676]  Again, that's 800-809-4491.
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:13.186]  Okay, he's a retired three-star general, so it is Lieutenant General, former head of Pakistani intelligence, General Hamid Gul.
[02:24:13.186 --> 02:24:15.367]  And he is with us today.
[02:24:15.367 --> 02:24:18.449]  And I have to tell you, I've researched this all in depth myself.
[02:24:18.449 --> 02:24:23.853]  It's been declassified, the CIA, Mossad, MI6 stage terror attacks.
[02:24:23.853 --> 02:24:27.936]  They're doing everything they can to get us into a full-bore war with Pakistan.
[02:24:27.936 --> 02:24:31.338]  Then they'll have to go in with a full invasion to get the nukes.
[02:24:33.356 --> 02:24:41.265]  I mean, if you think that the Afghans are tough and hard to beat, the Pakistanis are just as tough or tougher and have nuclear weapons.
[02:24:41.265 --> 02:24:42.947]  But I'll get into that in a moment with General Gould.
[02:24:42.947 --> 02:24:45.470]  General Gould, I brought up the Mumbai attacks.
[02:24:45.470 --> 02:24:52.417]  It was later confirmed that that was run by Western intelligence, and you were getting into 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:24:52.417 --> 02:24:53.579]  Please spend some time on that.
[02:24:55.170 --> 02:24:59.932]  Yeah, 9-11, they haven't given the evidence so far, and I think much hype was created.
[02:24:59.932 --> 02:25:02.873]  Now they don't even mention about Osama bin Laden.
[02:25:02.873 --> 02:25:05.573]  The latest statement is by General Petraeus.
[02:25:05.573 --> 02:25:11.635]  He said that he is so far away that whether he is alive or dead doesn't matter at all.
[02:25:11.635 --> 02:25:20.158]  So that means they have forgotten about Osama bin Laden now, and they are out to destroy the Afghan nation and then come for Pakistan.
[02:25:20.158 --> 02:25:23.799]  From day one, I said 9-11 was a pretext.
[02:25:24.412 --> 02:25:32.088]  Afghanistan is the lodging place, this is the staging point, and from there they will jump into Pakistan.
[02:25:32.088 --> 02:25:34.272]  And I fear that this is coming true.
[02:25:34.975 --> 02:25:40.178]  But in Pakistan, there's overwhelming interest of both India and Israel.
[02:25:40.178 --> 02:25:45.801]  It's not America's interest, because America won't bother whether Pakistan has 30, 40 or 100 bombs.
[02:25:45.801 --> 02:25:47.742]  It makes no difference to America.
[02:25:47.742 --> 02:25:50.323]  We have no such hostility between us.
[02:25:50.323 --> 02:25:54.786]  In fact, we have been very fast friends in the past, and we still are friends.
[02:25:54.786 --> 02:26:01.910]  Anyway, the point is that Israel would simply not be able to digest Pakistan's nuclear program, nor the Indians.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:10.903]  So, Pakistan's nuclear program is one point which needs to be now resolved, one way or another.
[02:26:10.903 --> 02:26:17.246]  Either they have to accept that Pakistan is a de facto nuclear power and should be entered into the nuclear club,
[02:26:17.944 --> 02:26:19.826]  Because that's a reality.
[02:26:19.826 --> 02:26:29.916]  And the fact that they have not accepted it, while India's nuclear capability has been accepted, that means they are still out to destroy it somehow.
[02:26:29.916 --> 02:26:33.779]  They can't reverse it and they cannot destroy it.
[02:26:33.779 --> 02:26:35.181]  Now that is where
[02:26:36.421 --> 02:26:43.445]  My understanding of Pakistan's ability, Pakistan's will to resist and its resilience comes into play.
[02:26:43.445 --> 02:26:57.954]  I can assure you there is a complete consensus in Pakistan on this one issue, that nuclear capability we have to protect even if in the process we end up with total destruction.
[02:26:57.954 --> 02:27:02.437]  Doesn't matter, but we will protect this capability of ours.
[02:27:02.437 --> 02:27:03.958]  It's a great asset for Pakistan.
[02:27:04.458 --> 02:27:18.647]  But my fear, Alex, is that if Pakistan is put to the corner and it is pushed against the wall, Pakistan, being an Islamic state, could also declare international jihad.
[02:27:18.647 --> 02:27:25.672]  Now, if that Islamic state declares international jihad, it becomes binding on the Muslims of the rest of the world.
[02:27:26.508 --> 02:27:28.829]  To come out in support of Jihad.
[02:27:28.829 --> 02:27:34.491]  That is what will change the modern history altogether, if that call is given.
[02:27:34.491 --> 02:27:43.354]  So let Pakistan not be taken lightly by the adversaries, by India, by Israel, or even by America.
[02:27:43.354 --> 02:27:47.176]  Pakistan has a potential, which is a very dangerous potential.
[02:27:47.176 --> 02:27:48.196]  We wouldn't like to do that.
[02:27:48.736 --> 02:27:56.185]  But if we have no other choice, if it is an existentialist threat to us, then anything is possible.
[02:27:56.185 --> 02:27:58.828]  And it better be avoided by our adversaries.
[02:28:00.256 --> 02:28:17.246]  General, I'm showing viewers Spy Talk, the issue from about two months ago in the Washington Post, with a headline, CIA's Unit Wacky Idea Depicts Saddam as Gay, but buried in the article, they admit that they made fake Bin Laden videos.
[02:28:17.246 --> 02:28:20.607]  The famous Bin Laden video is a fake.
[02:28:20.607 --> 02:28:24.750]  So, Bin Laden was writing letters saying he didn't do this after the attacks.
[02:28:25.350 --> 02:28:30.576]  Meanwhile, they use message boards and fake videos and they admit it was a fake video.
[02:28:30.576 --> 02:28:34.561]  Why would the CIA arrogantly come out and admit they're growing the opium?
[02:28:34.561 --> 02:28:39.908]  Why would they arrogantly come out and brag that they are creating fake Bin Laden videos?
[02:28:39.908 --> 02:28:42.431]  I mean, why are they so arrogant?
[02:28:43.755 --> 02:28:53.188]  Well, this is the imperial arrogance, imperial hubris, which I think afflicts every nation which comes into that position, where it stands at the pinnacle.
[02:28:53.188 --> 02:28:58.895]  And there is no one to destroy them, but they themselves, their own internal cavities destroy them.
[02:28:59.896 --> 02:29:00.437]  I think so.
[02:29:16.873 --> 02:29:20.574]  Because there are lesser men, the leaders are lesser leaders.
[02:29:20.574 --> 02:29:32.096]  They are, there are pygmies as far as intellectual capacity is concerned, as far as their moral quality is concerned, they are pygmies.
[02:29:32.096 --> 02:29:33.896]  This is the problem of the leadership.
[02:29:33.896 --> 02:29:45.418]  So I think while we in the third world countries usually cry about our leaders, I think poor America is also really bereft of the quality leadership that they deserve and they
[02:29:45.819 --> 02:29:46.760]  General, stay there.
[02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:48.804]  Final segment with you coming up straight ahead.
[02:29:48.804 --> 02:29:51.189]  We'll talk more about World War III.
[02:29:51.189 --> 02:29:52.591]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.591 --> 02:29:55.116]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.116 --> 02:29:57.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.612 --> 02:30:03.735]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:30:03.735 --> 02:30:07.538]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:30:07.538 --> 02:30:10.421]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:30:10.421 --> 02:30:15.346]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:15.786 --> 02:30:21.728]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.

[02:30:42.637 --> 02:30:45.018]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[02:31:00.564 --> 02:31:05.527]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:31:05.527 --> 02:31:06.528]  What have we got?
[02:31:06.528 --> 02:31:08.969]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:31:08.969 --> 02:31:09.970]  A republic.
[02:31:09.970 --> 02:31:12.632]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:31:12.632 --> 02:31:14.893]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:31:14.893 --> 02:31:16.914]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:31:16.914 --> 02:31:18.595]  So they think they own our land?
[02:31:18.595 --> 02:31:19.916]  They think they own our water?
[02:31:19.916 --> 02:31:20.516]  Children?
[02:31:20.516 --> 02:31:21.637]  Our education?
[02:31:21.637 --> 02:31:22.478]  Our money?
[02:31:22.478 --> 02:31:26.140]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:31.466]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:31:31.466 --> 02:31:32.487]  We have the facts.
[02:31:32.487 --> 02:31:33.648]  We have the Constitution.
[02:31:33.648 --> 02:31:34.549]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:31:34.549 --> 02:31:35.450]  We have common law.
[02:31:35.450 --> 02:31:37.973]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:37.973 --> 02:31:41.737]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[02:32:50.171 --> 02:32:52.153]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:52.153 --> 02:33:01.299]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:20.582 --> 02:33:27.392]  We star General Hamid Gul, former head of Pakistani intelligence who led the forces to victory against the Soviet bear.
[02:33:27.392 --> 02:33:32.279]  When you watch the films and read the documents about the Soviets massacring villages...
[02:33:33.385 --> 02:33:34.765]  Carpet bombing villages.
[02:33:34.765 --> 02:33:37.806]  It's exactly what our criminal government's doing.
[02:33:37.806 --> 02:33:44.368]  The same corporations that have occupied Afghanistan using our military are occupying my country.
[02:33:44.368 --> 02:33:50.189]  They're waging war against my Bill of Rights, my Constitution, my children's future.
[02:33:50.189 --> 02:33:52.210]  I want my republic back.
[02:33:52.210 --> 02:33:54.850]  I want to be known as the land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:33:54.850 --> 02:33:57.651]  An example of goodness, not an example of evil.
[02:33:58.351 --> 02:33:59.071]  They lie to you.
[02:33:59.071 --> 02:34:00.912]  They give you fake Bin Laden videos.
[02:34:00.912 --> 02:34:02.793]  They stage terror attacks.
[02:34:02.793 --> 02:34:05.995]  They say Saddam's got WMDs when he doesn't.
[02:34:05.995 --> 02:34:10.878]  And they want to start World War III, not just with Iran, but Pakistan.
[02:34:10.878 --> 02:34:19.422]  I concur with General Gould's analysis 100% from my own deep 18-hour-a-day research, many days.
[02:34:19.422 --> 02:34:20.423]  Okay?
[02:34:20.423 --> 02:34:22.224]  We are going into World War III.
[02:34:22.224 --> 02:34:26.106]  And General Gould, you talked about how they want to cause the collapse
[02:34:27.027 --> 02:34:30.140]  Of Pakistan, how they're funding radicals there, which has been admitted.
[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:30.803]  They've been caught.
[02:34:32.170 --> 02:34:52.798]  And how they want Pakistan to have their back against a wall, so they have to declare an emergency jihad to protect themselves and call on aid, as Afghanistan did, so they can have what the PNAC documents and the Israelis and Dick Cheney called for in the September 20, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defense's PNAC document, a clash of civilizations.
[02:34:52.798 --> 02:34:56.300]  They want to force the American people into a bare-knuckle war.
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:58.620]  To fully commit us.
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:00.581]  I believe they're going to set off nukes in the U.S.
[02:35:00.581 --> 02:35:03.582]  and blame it on Pakistan and Iran.
[02:35:03.582 --> 02:35:07.903]  I see them putting out this story to where the Americans will howl with pure rage.
[02:35:07.903 --> 02:35:13.765]  They will ship three million Americans over there, bloodthirsty, ready for absolute genocide.
[02:35:13.765 --> 02:35:20.607]  And so your people, my people, have to stand together against the New World Order, just like they want to put two pit bulls in a...
[02:35:21.527 --> 02:35:23.629]  In a ring and have us kill each other.
[02:35:23.629 --> 02:35:40.203]  We don't need to do this We need to be smart enough to avert this and the evidence is clear We are on the verge of them launching World War three a clash between Christendom what's left of it in the West and the East a war without end general your comments
[02:35:41.448 --> 02:35:44.069]  My comments are that there is no clash of civilization.
[02:35:44.069 --> 02:35:46.951]  This is a myth that has been created, unfortunately.
[02:35:46.951 --> 02:35:50.193]  There has to be a meeting of civilization.
[02:35:50.193 --> 02:35:55.116]  And as far as Islam is concerned, why is it being looked upon as an enemy, as an adversary?
[02:35:55.116 --> 02:35:58.217]  Islam encompasses Christianity and Judaism.
[02:35:58.217 --> 02:36:04.541]  It is not an entity in itself, but actually it encompasses all the three religions of the book.
[02:36:05.081 --> 02:36:10.823]  So, there has to be enmity, peace among us, and everyone has to gain from it.
[02:36:10.823 --> 02:36:16.506]  And therefore, there is no need for the dark impulse in the American system.
[02:36:16.506 --> 02:36:19.747]  I won't say in the American people, because they are so good.
[02:36:19.747 --> 02:36:24.049]  It is in the American system that dark impulse has to be removed.
[02:36:24.549 --> 02:36:41.147]  And it can only be removed by the American people if they rise against it, like the moratorium movement back in the Vietnam days, when it picked up from Berkeley's campus and then it spread across the cities and villages of whole of America.
[02:36:41.147 --> 02:36:46.873]  It became the battle cry for American people that this was a useless war.
[02:36:47.453 --> 02:36:52.998]  This was a debilitating war, and we must quit as soon as possible, which they did.
[02:36:52.998 --> 02:36:56.380]  And, of course, America still remained a great power.
[02:36:56.380 --> 02:37:06.549]  And eventually, because of the Afghan blood, because the services of Pakistan and men like me, that America enjoys today the status of the sole superpower.
[02:37:07.129 --> 02:37:17.792]  Now, America is hell-bent, or that dark impulse in the American system is hell-bent, that they destroy America's position as the sole superpower.
[02:37:17.792 --> 02:37:19.933]  So, it has to be morally corrected.
[02:37:19.933 --> 02:37:28.776]  Unfortunately, telling lies with regard to Iraq, telling lies with regard to 9-11, and telling lies now with regard to the Bombay attack.
[02:37:29.376 --> 02:37:33.419]  Everywhere it is lies, lies, and lies, nothing else.
[02:37:33.419 --> 02:37:40.885]  And that is not going to be helpful, because that is going to totally demolish the American position.
[02:37:40.885 --> 02:37:48.210]  American economy is in doldrums, but the generals of the Pentagon, they would want America to commit more forces.
[02:37:49.171 --> 02:37:55.316]  In Afghanistan and elsewhere, and now they want to pick a fight with Iran at the same time, pick a fight with Pakistan.
[02:37:55.316 --> 02:37:56.337]  I don't know.
[02:37:56.337 --> 02:38:03.184]  They have to sit down, war game it, and if I am there, I will tell each one of them how wrong they are.
[02:38:03.184 --> 02:38:05.986]  They are lesser to be learned from military history.
[02:38:05.986 --> 02:38:09.390]  In Afghanistan, for instance, the spaces are not in their control.
[02:38:12.546 --> 02:38:17.049]  Is actually the outcome of three interplay of three factors, which is very important.
[02:38:17.049 --> 02:38:19.971]  Now, I'm talking as a professional soldier.
[02:38:19.971 --> 02:38:23.994]  The time, space and relative strength.
[02:38:23.994 --> 02:38:29.158]  In Afghanistan, Americans have the watch and opposition has the time.
[02:38:29.158 --> 02:38:31.259]  The Mujahideen have the time.
[02:38:31.259 --> 02:38:35.923]  In Afghanistan, again, they have the spaces are with the opposition.
[02:38:36.907 --> 02:38:41.352]  And Americans are confined only to garrison town.
[02:38:41.352 --> 02:38:45.016]  More and more they will be squeezed into the garrison town.
[02:38:45.016 --> 02:38:55.468]  And third factor, that of relative strength, agreed that America has firepower, but America does not have a willing, motivated manpower.
[02:38:56.068 --> 02:39:01.555]  Slowly, gradually, the American soldiers have started now asking, what are we here for?
[02:39:01.555 --> 02:39:03.978]  Why are we laying down our lives?
[02:39:03.978 --> 02:39:09.645]  And I think this is a terrible situation if it seeps into the minds of the soldiers.
[02:39:09.645 --> 02:39:12.149]  And I think before this really erupts,
[02:39:12.669 --> 02:39:23.892]  It's better for America, it's better for the world that they pull out of here and they abandon any notions of attacking Iran or coming for Pakistan's nuclear capability.
[02:39:23.892 --> 02:39:30.534]  They cannot pluck it out and it can create a desperate Pakistan which could do anything.
[02:39:30.534 --> 02:39:35.155]  I'm not saying that Pakistan won't do it, but I think
[02:39:35.655 --> 02:39:55.284]  There are possibilities and there are chances that Pakistan may actually have to, for its own existence, for its own honor, for its own well-being, it can go to the extreme limit, which would not be good for the countries who want to see Pakistan's nuclear capability destroyed and Pakistan cut to pieces.
[02:39:55.284 --> 02:39:56.885]  No, it will not happen.
[02:39:56.885 --> 02:39:58.266]  I can assure you this.
[02:39:58.266 --> 02:40:02.928]  And they better disabuse their minds and their plans of this kind of notion.
[02:40:05.017 --> 02:40:10.160]  General, a few other points I wanted to bring up to you and then any other points you'd like to make and we'll let you go.
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:14.342]  We're very thankful for your time today and your courage to come on this broadcast.
[02:40:14.342 --> 02:40:19.004]  But specifically, Benazir Bhutto, dealing with another lie.
[02:40:19.004 --> 02:40:26.669]  Our media said that she fell and hit her head on the side of a car, even though all over European and Central Asian news,
[02:40:27.689 --> 02:40:28.810]  I've been saying that
[02:40:52.899 --> 02:40:55.622]  All along, he has been killed by the Americans.
[02:40:55.622 --> 02:40:58.406]  He's been killed by Dick Cheney's people.
[02:40:58.406 --> 02:41:09.038]  They are the ones who are operating in Dick Cheney's order because Dick Cheney has drawn up a plan of governance for Pakistan and Benazir has become rebellious.
[02:41:09.538 --> 02:41:16.860]  She refused to meet Negra Ponte, because Negra Ponte had told her not to go in Pakistan until after the election.
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:21.681]  But she dared them, and she came and she said, I want independent judiciary.
[02:41:21.681 --> 02:41:31.624]  She sent me a message through an emissary, a good friend of hers and me, and he came and said that she says, General, I am now agreeing with you.
[02:41:31.624 --> 02:41:36.025]  I tend to agree with you that the Americans have evil designs on Pakistan.
[02:41:36.726 --> 02:41:42.117]  And therefore I know that she had become very dangerous for them.
[02:41:42.788 --> 02:41:48.132]  For Dick Cheney and company, who wanted things to happen in a certain way in Pakistan.
[02:41:48.132 --> 02:41:51.315]  Unfortunately, those things are happening in that fashion.
[02:41:51.315 --> 02:41:53.917]  And I think Pakistan is in tatters today.
[02:41:53.917 --> 02:41:56.159]  Pakistan has to be redeemed.
[02:41:56.159 --> 02:42:01.704]  And I think the young generation of Pakistan is very angry, very unhappy with America.
[02:42:01.704 --> 02:42:06.768]  So America must not think of ruling Pakistan by proxies.
[02:42:06.768 --> 02:42:07.729]  This is wrong.
[02:42:07.729 --> 02:42:11.752]  And I think they should quit this idea as soon as possible.
[02:42:12.008 --> 02:42:15.232]  Well, General Gould, here is my message to the Pakistani people.
[02:42:15.232 --> 02:42:28.828]  I know you're hardworking, intelligent, good people, who have always been friends with the United States, and I have the globalist-owned PNAC plans to go in and destabilize you and overthrow your country and then put
[02:42:29.489 --> 02:42:55.116]  extremist in power so that you won't have a highly developed civilization and they're threatened by that and they also want to use up America's treasure and our good name and destroy us in the international community via your destruction so that this new global corporate state known as the New World Order can rise and they now admit they're forming a world government run by private banks
[02:42:55.856 --> 02:42:59.981]  They have a global carbon tax that's meant to strangle development.
[02:42:59.981 --> 02:43:01.242]  This is eugenics.
[02:43:01.242 --> 02:43:13.716]  And from my research, I've never read your writings on this subject, but I'm curious your view on the aim of this global corporate Anglo-American New World Order system and are you aware that they've been caught
[02:43:14.136 --> 02:43:19.802]  Giving children in Central Asia, this is CBS News, real polio in the shots to kill them.
[02:43:19.802 --> 02:43:24.767]  They've been caught adding sterilants to the tetanus shots to sterilize women.
[02:43:24.767 --> 02:43:34.598]  And that from my research, Latin America, Africa, Central Asia, Pakistan, particularly, is targeted by a covert population reduction program.
[02:43:34.598 --> 02:43:35.439]  Are you aware of that, sir?
[02:43:37.087 --> 02:43:42.213]  Yes, I've heard of it and I think it's very obnoxious to say the least.
[02:43:42.213 --> 02:43:54.347]  But America appears to be becoming heartless and I think the American people have got to win back their heart and they have to come up with an opinion.
[02:43:55.207 --> 02:43:55.908]  We're good to go.
[02:44:22.722 --> 02:44:26.288]  General Hamid Gul, thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:44:26.288 --> 02:44:33.901]  I look forward to speaking to you again in the future, and I hope that our two countries can be friends, and I hope that we can get our nation back from the globalists.
[02:44:33.901 --> 02:44:34.643]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:44:35.307 --> 02:44:36.788]  Thank you, Alex, and goodbye.
[02:44:36.788 --> 02:44:38.488]  Goodbye, General Gould.
[02:44:38.488 --> 02:44:48.712]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen, an hour and 15 minute live uncensored interview with three-star General Hamid Gould, former head of Pakistani intelligence.
[02:44:48.712 --> 02:44:53.714]  And I will post this video and audio at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:53.714 --> 02:45:01.877]  If you missed any of it in the live show today, it'll be up just minutes after the live broadcast ends, after Max Keiser is with us on The Economy and other news.
[02:45:02.918 --> 02:45:06.843]  But what you just heard is the truth from all of my research.
[02:45:06.843 --> 02:45:11.970]  Separately, with doing my own research, I can find nothing that Hamid Gul said here.
[02:45:13.203 --> 02:45:14.504]  That isn't Veritas.
[02:45:14.504 --> 02:45:16.324]  That isn't the truth.
[02:45:16.324 --> 02:45:22.647]  And this guy was a hero in our media in the 80s, leading the attacks against the Soviets.
[02:45:22.647 --> 02:45:34.112]  And now, you know, it's the Russians saying we better be careful in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and it's our own government, run by a bunch of crooks, that is trying to expand all of this.
[02:45:34.112 --> 02:45:39.574]  So, a very informative interview with Lieutenant General Hamid Gul, and obviously
[02:45:40.094 --> 02:45:57.823]  In the days to come, you'll probably see a lot of news articles written about all of this, but what was the one line, Jaren, that he said that you thought would be a good idea to name the video of this when we posted it at PrisonPlanet.tv?
[02:45:57.823 --> 02:45:59.243]  God help America.
[02:45:59.243 --> 02:46:01.304]  Hamid Gul, God help America.
[02:46:01.304 --> 02:46:06.327]  This is a guy actually trained over here, and our media
[02:46:08.077 --> 02:46:17.662]  Is using fake battlefield reports, even the Washington Post said are very questionable, to claim that this 74 year old gentleman, did he say 74 or 76?
[02:46:17.662 --> 02:46:26.426]  To claim that he is running all these attacks, when it's all these different tribes, all these different groups, who many times are even fighting with each other.
[02:46:26.426 --> 02:46:30.588]  I mean, nobody's running this, nobody's controlling this.
[02:46:30.588 --> 02:46:35.131]  That's the globalist mindset, is they create crises so big,
[02:46:36.132 --> 02:46:51.718]  And so out of control that the problems just get bigger and then they can spend more money and more troops and project more power in the name of cleaning it up, but the plan is only to make it worse and commit us to an endless war.
[02:46:52.745 --> 02:47:01.267]  And that's why as a patriotic American who defends the entire Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, and Constitution, I agree with George Washington.
[02:47:01.267 --> 02:47:03.648]  And we know FEMA demonizes George Washington.
[02:47:03.648 --> 02:47:11.950]  I have video training films where they teach police and firefighters and sheriff's deputies that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were terrorists and were bad.
[02:47:11.950 --> 02:47:13.571]  It's in my film Road to Tyranny.
[02:47:15.885 --> 02:47:24.428]  And it's just so disgusting to see this, but George Washington, now Al-Qaeda, according to our government, I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but it's true.
[02:47:24.428 --> 02:47:26.169]  He said no foreign entanglements.
[02:47:26.169 --> 02:47:27.889]  We're not an empire.
[02:47:27.889 --> 02:47:30.010]  We're going to trade with people, like Ron Paul says.
[02:47:30.010 --> 02:47:31.611]  We're going to have business with people.
[02:47:32.151 --> 02:47:34.132]  I got a bunch of other news coming up on the economy.
[02:47:34.132 --> 02:47:37.955]  I want to head on ahead of Max Keiser joining us, some other military news.
[02:47:37.955 --> 02:47:52.484]  We got a break here in a moment, but I've got an hour and 47 minutes without telling you about what makes this operation float, what funds this operation, but more importantly, that's just a caveat, a fringe benefit, a symbiosis, a symbiotic relationship.
[02:47:52.484 --> 02:47:54.665]  These films are waking people up.
[02:47:54.665 --> 02:47:59.689]  You can show them the well-produced, well-documented, riveting, real-world films.
[02:48:00.689 --> 02:48:03.370]  And your friends and family are ready to be awakened.
[02:48:03.370 --> 02:48:11.993]  You can get all my films or films I produce and make copies of them and air them on AXS TV and give them to people for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:48:11.993 --> 02:48:14.793]  Invisible Empire, a New World Order defined by Jason Burma.
[02:48:14.793 --> 02:48:16.194]  Such an important film.
[02:48:16.194 --> 02:48:18.495]  Took us a year and a half to make this.
[02:48:18.495 --> 02:48:24.517]  Covers the whole New World Order architecture, their order out of chaos program, hundreds of New World Order global government quotes.
[02:48:24.517 --> 02:48:26.157]  This is such an important film.
[02:48:26.157 --> 02:48:28.138]  This special ends next Monday.
[02:48:28.138 --> 02:48:29.238]  You've got a week to

[02:48:31.879 --> 02:48:36.822]  You can go ahead and do all your Christmas shopping early, have it all.

[02:48:38.563 --> 02:48:40.544]  So you get four copies, $19.95, buy one, get three free.

[02:48:42.866 --> 02:48:43.446]  Ten videos for $39.90.
[02:48:43.446 --> 02:48:45.087]  Ten copies of Invisible Empire for $39.90.
[02:48:58.300 --> 02:49:00.601]  Same thing with Police State 4, the rise of FEMA.
[02:49:00.601 --> 02:49:13.248]  The entire 15 years of my research, the latest developments, the secret governor's councils, the Military Commissions Act, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the executive orders, all of it is covered in this film.
[02:49:14.208 --> 02:49:20.610]  The FEMA camps, the clergy response teams, how the underwear bombing on Christmas Day was staged.
[02:49:20.610 --> 02:49:25.052]  It is all covered in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:49:25.052 --> 02:49:27.353]  So many subjects, well documented.
[02:49:27.353 --> 02:49:28.833]  Buy one, get three free.
[02:49:28.833 --> 02:49:31.094]  Buy two, get eight free.

[02:49:33.595 --> 02:49:35.817]  Four copies, $19.95.
[02:49:35.817 --> 02:49:38.259]  Same thing with Part 2 of the Obama Deception.
[02:49:38.259 --> 02:49:40.421]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:49:40.421 --> 02:49:42.162]  The presidency of Barack H. Obama.
[02:49:42.162 --> 02:49:43.724]  How they plan to start the wars.
[02:49:43.724 --> 02:49:45.625]  How they plan to steal the pension funds.
[02:49:45.625 --> 02:49:47.327]  Made this almost a year ago.
[02:49:47.327 --> 02:49:48.868]  It's all coming true now.
[02:49:48.868 --> 02:49:50.870]  People see this and are blown away.
[02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:52.791]  The production quality is off the chart.
[02:49:52.791 --> 02:49:54.272]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:49:54.272 --> 02:49:55.634]  You can get all three of these films.
[02:49:55.634 --> 02:49:56.715]  Buy one, get three free.

[02:50:37.959 --> 02:50:38.359]  They've got the 64
[02:50:39.179 --> 02:50:45.344]  It's actually 120 or even higher audio of video of the entire archive of the full show.
[02:50:45.344 --> 02:50:49.607]  We now do the whole transmission as TV as well, not just part of it.
[02:50:49.607 --> 02:50:53.469]  It's all at PrisonPlanet.TV and your memberships make all this possible.
[02:50:53.469 --> 02:50:59.774]  And later this week, exclusive for PrisonPlanet.TV members, my interview with Jesse Ventura on KeyInfo here in Austin last week.
[02:51:01.391 --> 02:51:01.971]  Attention!
[02:51:01.971 --> 02:51:06.973]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[02:51:06.973 --> 02:51:12.655]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[02:51:12.655 --> 02:51:19.817]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:51:19.817 --> 02:51:25.819]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement.
[02:51:25.939 --> 02:51:29.781]  For you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:51:29.781 --> 02:51:32.922]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:51:32.922 --> 02:51:39.765]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:51:39.765 --> 02:51:48.708]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[02:51:48.708 --> 02:51:53.330]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[02:51:53.490 --> 02:51:53.810]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again 800-902-6969
[02:52:01.550 --> 02:52:06.533]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.533 --> 02:52:07.514]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.514 --> 02:52:09.975]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.975 --> 02:52:10.976]  A republic.
[02:52:10.976 --> 02:52:13.638]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.638 --> 02:52:15.899]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.899 --> 02:52:17.920]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:19.601]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.601 --> 02:52:20.922]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.922 --> 02:52:21.522]  Children?
[02:52:21.522 --> 02:52:22.643]  Our education?
[02:52:22.643 --> 02:52:23.484]  Our money?
[02:52:23.484 --> 02:52:27.146]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.486 --> 02:52:32.452]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:32.452 --> 02:52:33.493]  We have the facts.
[02:52:33.493 --> 02:52:34.654]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.654 --> 02:52:35.556]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.556 --> 02:52:36.437]  We have common law.
[02:52:36.437 --> 02:52:38.980]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:42.744]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:42.844 --> 02:52:47.810]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:47.810 --> 02:52:49.312]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:49.312 --> 02:52:50.393]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:50.393 --> 02:52:57.261]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:53:01.607 --> 02:53:03.447]  No one likes foreclosure.
[02:53:03.447 --> 02:53:08.348]  You won't say, think, or even consider foreclosure with ZerodetGuarantee.com.
[02:53:08.348 --> 02:53:08.808]  Why?
[02:53:08.808 --> 02:53:17.310]  Because ZerodetGuarantee.com guarantees to stop your foreclosure for at least two years with no payments, no bankruptcy, and no negotiating.
[02:53:17.310 --> 02:53:18.750]  Thinking loan modification?
[02:53:18.750 --> 02:53:20.430]  That still keeps you in default.
[02:53:20.430 --> 02:53:28.952]  Zerodet in 90 days is the only proven system that keeps you in your house for as long as you want to stay, while making it possible to even get clear title to your house.
[02:53:29.272 --> 02:53:32.696]  No, we are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.
[02:53:32.696 --> 02:53:39.925]  We are a group of people just like you that are sick and tired of the housing crash, and we've helped thousands avoid foreclosure since 1993.

[02:53:49.517 --> 02:53:50.398]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[02:54:05.552 --> 02:54:10.297]  Hi, this is former Governor Jesse Ventura, and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:10.297 --> 02:54:23.571]  I recommend you all pay attention to Alex, because Alex and I are teaming up again this fall for a second season of Conspiracy Theory, where we will attempt to get to the bottom of these conspiracies.
[02:54:23.571 --> 02:54:26.313]  Until then, keep watching and listening to Alex.
[02:54:33.471 --> 02:54:42.356]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:54:42.356 --> 02:54:56.282]  Well, right when we kick off the third hour, Max Keiser, stockbroker, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange, great trends forecaster, he'll be joining us today on this live Monday, 16th day of August, 2010.
[02:54:58.677 --> 02:55:03.320]  I'm going to get into the economy with Kaiser coming up and the Iran situation.
[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:06.282]  But first, I wanted to get into some Big Brother news.
[02:55:06.282 --> 02:55:11.645]  This is up at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[02:55:11.645 --> 02:55:19.470]  Remember six, seven years ago in Australia and the U.S., the NSA was going to give local police and Bureau of Land Management
[02:55:20.330 --> 02:55:27.992]  Well, all Google did, which is admittedly part of the NSA, I mean, I told you that many years ago, now they admit it, is they just made it all public to everybody.
[02:55:47.273 --> 02:55:54.684]  And government is now using this to harass people, and all over the world, because the same global corporations are setting this up.
[02:55:54.684 --> 02:56:01.032]  They're banning people collecting their own rainwater, and now they're saying you've got to pay for rain to fall on your crops.
[02:56:02.230 --> 02:56:04.311]  But then other nations don't have to do that.
[02:56:04.311 --> 02:56:05.171]  It's all selective.
[02:56:05.171 --> 02:56:07.152]  It's all part of the carbon tax.
[02:56:07.152 --> 02:56:10.413]  This will shut down our industry and our farming even more.
[02:56:10.413 --> 02:56:15.355]  Key article up at PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson today.
[02:56:15.355 --> 02:56:19.997]  Government using Google Earth to loot destitute Americans.
[02:56:19.997 --> 02:56:21.738]  And I actually heard an NPR piece.
[02:56:22.598 --> 02:56:27.021]  About two weeks ago, and thought to call Watson, because a lot of times I call Watson or Kurt.
[02:56:27.021 --> 02:56:30.363]  Kurt works here now, he's moved to Austin from New Mexico.
[02:56:30.363 --> 02:56:32.104]  So I'll usually go into their office or call them.
[02:56:32.104 --> 02:56:34.145]  Watson's in England, both Watsons are.
[02:56:34.145 --> 02:56:40.249]  And I'll say right on this, and I forgot to, but that's why I love Watson, because he thinks just like I do, and he wrote a story about it.
[02:56:40.249 --> 02:56:43.931]  But NPR was saying it was good.
[02:56:43.931 --> 02:56:48.774]  In Greece, and in other countries, the government to raise money,
[02:56:49.835 --> 02:56:57.760]  Is charging people, depending on the city, $300 to $1,000 or 1,000 euros for a swimming pool fee.
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:02.382]  Or they notice if your swimming pool looks like it's in disuse, they come and fine you.
[02:57:02.382 --> 02:57:04.604]  So it's all part of this surveillance harassment.
[02:57:04.604 --> 02:57:11.288]  Remember that Pennsylvania tax collection ad where it says, hey, Tom, we're watching you.
[02:57:11.288 --> 02:57:14.309]  You didn't pay $4,000 taxes and we know where you live.
[02:57:14.309 --> 02:57:18.232]  And it shows the earth and they zoom in from space and show the guy's house.
[02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:22.971]  Again, this is all designed for you.
[02:57:22.971 --> 02:57:23.432]  Here it is.
[02:57:23.432 --> 02:57:24.072]  Smile.
[02:57:24.072 --> 02:57:26.754]  Aerial images being used to enforce laws.
[02:57:26.754 --> 02:57:29.096]  Associated Press.
[02:57:29.096 --> 02:57:31.218]  And that was August 14th, just two days ago.
[02:57:31.218 --> 02:57:33.720]  In fact, crank this ad up.
[02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:34.200]  Start it over.
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:35.762]  That's a good idea.
[02:57:35.762 --> 02:57:39.565]  Crank up the ad, because I want people to actually see and hear this ad where they're intimidating people.
[02:57:39.565 --> 02:57:39.865]  Here it is.
[02:57:42.298 --> 02:57:43.800]  Just off of 5th Street.
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:45.061]  Nice car, Tom.
[02:57:45.061 --> 02:57:45.963]  Nice house.
[02:57:45.963 --> 02:57:52.651]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[02:57:52.651 --> 02:57:53.832]  Listen, Tom.
[02:57:53.832 --> 02:57:55.434]  We can make this easy.
[02:57:55.434 --> 02:58:00.881]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[02:58:01.852 --> 02:58:06.454]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[02:58:06.454 --> 02:58:08.855]  Oh, find us before we find you.
[02:58:08.855 --> 02:58:11.356]  So this whole grid isn't for the terrorists.
[02:58:11.356 --> 02:58:11.996]  That's the government.
[02:58:11.996 --> 02:58:13.436]  They're staging almost all of it.
[02:58:13.436 --> 02:58:14.837]  It's for us.
[02:58:14.837 --> 02:58:29.242]  State utilizing aerial imagery technology to enforce petty ordinances and loot destitute citizens of whatever income they have left after having had trillions in wealth stolen and transferred to foreign banks and trillions spent to build these satellites and launch them.
[02:58:29.242 --> 02:58:30.803]  And the whole article just goes over
[02:58:31.889 --> 02:58:32.530]  Uh, Ed.
[02:58:32.530 --> 02:58:34.452]  And then there's another report here.
[02:58:34.452 --> 02:58:39.137]  They're now coming in to charge you for rainwater usage.
[02:58:39.137 --> 02:58:46.265]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
