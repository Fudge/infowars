[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:23.279]  Slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss
[00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:27.846]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:29.587]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:40.617]  I'm going to go ahead and get into the financial news, and then I'm going to take some of your phone calls, and then we will continue on with what's happening with Al Gore.
[00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.959]  Portland police reopened Al Gore sex abuse allegations.
[00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.703]  I'm going to get more into the Russian spies infiltrating Harvard.
[00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:51.190]  And infiltrating corporations because they've taken America over.
[00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:57.645]  We were conquered a long time ago, so if the Russians want to infiltrate the government, they infiltrate Harvard and Goldman Sachs, which they were doing.
[00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.430]  So continuing, that's what the New World Order is.
[00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:23.862]  They come in, corporate system, buy off your government, have laws passed to transfer governance power to the global corporations, until now you go to a UN meeting, or you read the minutes of an SPP meeting, or a Bilderberg meeting info, or a G20, it's private interest there, openly telling the government what to do, and the government clicks their heels and says, yes sir boss, how high do you want me to jump?
[00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:25.939]  Foreign bankers say, jump!
[00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:27.820]  Congress says, how high, boss?
[00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:29.702]  How many trillions do you want, boss?
[00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:34.345]  Then they have hearings later and Congress gets uppity and says, where'd that trillion dollars go?
[00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:35.566]  I'm not going to tell you.
[00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:37.127]  Not going to tell you.
[00:01:37.547 --> 00:01:38.848]  I'm the foreign banker head.
[00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:40.550]  I'm the head of the Treasury.
[00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.591]  I'm the head of Goldman Sachs.
[00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:44.553]  I'm the head of Bank of America.
[00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:46.294]  And I'm not going to tell you, little slave.
[00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:50.617]  So, of course the Russians tried to infiltrate the banks.
[00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.240]  Of course they tried to infiltrate the illegitimate government.
[00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:58.376]  And that is espionage, and they should get in trouble.
[00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:00.539]  And by the look of these women, you know how they were infiltrating.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.861]  That's spying 101.
[00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:04.445]  So that's coming up too.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.721]  But let us first just graze over the top headlines and we'll mine back into these.
[00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:15.902]  Coming up, Ron Paul is scheduled to come up in the last hour today, now an hour and a half from now.
[00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:21.723]  MSNBC radicals stock market and obvious corrupt fraud.
[00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:24.604]  What an amazing quote by an MSNBC host.
[00:02:25.204 --> 00:02:31.025]  We've got that video in the Raw Story article up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:35.215]  Continuing, Dow loses 10% in second quarter.
[00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:36.897]  S&P ends down 1,040 points.
[00:02:37.017 --> 00:02:37.177]  CNBC.
[00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:46.715]  Another CNBC story.
[00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:54.737]  Bad news on economy gives investors more reasons to sell, as the market is down several hundred points today, several hundred yesterday.
[00:02:54.757 --> 00:03:03.239]  In fact, guys, give me the latest stock market number, how many it's down right now, and give me the number, what it's currently at, how many points down and what the number is.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.341]  Continuing, Fed made taxpayers unwitting junk bond buyers.
[00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:13.228]  Well, yeah, of tens of trillions of dollars of derivatives.
[00:03:13.248 --> 00:03:17.031]  And there's another 600 trillion, The Washington Post says, hanging out there.
[00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:26.139]  And you're going to pay that through dollar devaluation, through euro devaluation, through yuan and yen devaluation, and through new taxes.
[00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.903]  And it's now admitted that it's a global coordinated destruction
[00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:41.264]  And that there will now be a new global SDR that you will pay your taxes to at the IMF and World Bank.
[00:03:42.084 --> 00:03:44.785]  And the market is down to 9,741.30, only 32 points.
[00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:46.286]  So it's gone back up some this morning since plunging.
[00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.371]  The Plunge Protection Team likes a slow, gradual fall.
[00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:59.634]  Continuing, Feds made taxpayers on winning junk bond buyers.
[00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:02.335]  Here's another one out of the Star Advertiser.
[00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:14.443]  We reported on this a year and a half ago and actually sent reporters to California and got reports from Hawaii where they're trying to lock people up at night who are homeless and not let them live in tent cities.
[00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:16.204]  That's one step away from concentration camps.
[00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:18.066]  California is now starting that.
[00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:25.935]  Homeless camps cover 50 acres from Wapeo Point around Middle Lock and to Pearl City.
[00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:30.417]  And just thousands and thousands of people, the star advertiser.
[00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:39.001]  Funny, the advertiser reported eight days before, I have a copy of it, Pearl Harbor, that they were going to attack on the December 7th.
[00:04:41.363 --> 00:04:48.346]  They'd even gotten the intel and then the base was ordered to stand down and they follow orders in the Navy and the Marines and Army.
[00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:51.768]  You know, you see a newspaper, and you remember all the other headlines.
[00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:55.169]  Yeah, it was the Honolulu Advertiser at the time.
[00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:58.770]  It's been changed to the Star Advertiser, but same paper, I'm told.
[00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.051]  So, just a little side note there.
[00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:03.912]  Continuing.
[00:05:04.272 --> 00:05:09.614]  Dollar should be replaced as international standard, UN report says.
[00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:12.175]  I covered this some yesterday, but you just can't.
[00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:35.514]  Michelle Bachman came out yesterday morning on a radio show and quoted from this a global government being established by the IMF World Bank that you'll pay your carbon taxes to and they will now, as I told you years ago, still have the dollar, the article says that, but it'll be denominated and pegged to an international board of private banks who you will then pay taxes to for the right to hold dollars or to have new currency issued or credit issued.
[00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:53.294]  So this, before the private bankers had to act through national governments, but now they've taken those over, so now they're just transcending borders completely, and are building their world government openly, and sucking the nation states completely dry, like Nosferatu would, one of his victims.
[00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:57.655]  They've gone from sucking individuals dry, to just sucking everyone dry.
[00:05:57.675 --> 00:05:58.636]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:02.957]  Japanese may strike over weekend, and that's the Honolulu advertiser.
[00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:04.438]  How did you guys find that so fast?
[00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:09.456]  And that date was actually eight days before.
[00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:10.776]  People ask, well how?
[00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:14.418]  Because they were giving Japanese time, which was a day earlier.
[00:06:15.178 --> 00:06:16.419]  But yeah, there it is.
[00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:17.859]  Japanese may strike over weekend.
[00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.140]  Then they list December 7th.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.821]  1941, a day that will live in infamy.
[00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:27.004]  See, we had patriots in the Navy, patriots in the Army, patriots in the Marines.
[00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:30.146]  They'd broken the Japanese purple and blue code a year before.
[00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:32.988]  The British had given it to the United States a year before.
[00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:34.669]  The Spymasters had.
[00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.031]  And, uh, because they had a whole global empire to run.
[00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:40.713]  Sun never set on the British Empire, and it doesn't today.
[00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:47.917]  Uh, and, um... Yeah, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, the guys just found that.
[00:06:48.398 --> 00:06:49.418]  Will you guys save that?
[00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:54.707]  Years ago, I found a copy of it in a book.
[00:06:54.727 --> 00:06:59.708]  And then I had one of my guys spend a lot of money getting it from the archives.
[00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:02.589]  And it took us about a week to figure out they changed the name.
[00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.851]  And then once we found it, it was sent to me, an original copy.
[00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:10.671]  It cost, I think, like 50 bucks, I forget.
[00:07:11.352 --> 00:07:12.192]  And then I lost it.
[00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:13.092]  It's somewhere around the office.
[00:07:13.112 --> 00:07:15.973]  But you found an online photo of it framed.
[00:07:16.113 --> 00:07:17.473]  Japanese made Strike Over Weekend.
[00:07:17.813 --> 00:07:19.434]  And see, all in little advertisers, just like I said.
[00:07:20.353 --> 00:07:27.713]  That's why the guys, you know, I can put an ad in Craigslist and I don't tell people they're coming to work for Alex Jones.
[00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:28.916]  I don't know.
[00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:00.460]  I don't know how I got off into that whole subject.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.882]  Oh yeah, I hire people and a lot of times they're like, yeah, I don't believe a word you say, but I'm taking the job.
[00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:07.662]  I'm like, you're exactly who we want.
[00:08:08.483 --> 00:08:11.184]  But when I'm talking about things, you will randomly search engine them.
[00:08:11.764 --> 00:08:14.245]  And then they search engine and everything I say is right there for them.
[00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:16.706]  No matter how insane it is, just all admitted.
[00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:19.847]  You could also pull up, but I can't remember the exact headline.
[00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.710]  The San Diego, uh, what is it?
[00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.511]  Herald Tribune?
[00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:28.572]  64 article when the ships got back a few months later and they got off and said, nobody attacked us.
[00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:29.692]  We're told to shut up.
[00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:30.533]  It's all staged.
[00:08:31.433 --> 00:08:35.974]  That's how we know Tonkin was staged and 40 something years later, we now know, but you can pull that one up.
[00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:41.555]  Wait, wait, wait, let me pull up the exact headline out of my mind.
[00:08:41.836 --> 00:08:42.256]  I can do it.
[00:08:42.276 --> 00:08:42.576]  Hold on.
[00:08:43.616 --> 00:08:43.756]  It's a 1964.
[00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:43.836]  Um,
[00:08:50.194 --> 00:08:52.255]  Article out of San Diego.
[00:08:52.275 --> 00:08:53.435]  I think it's Herald Tribune.
[00:08:53.455 --> 00:08:58.858]  I think's the name of the paper and The exact headline is hold on just a minute.
[00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:17.165]  I'm gonna try to remember this right now Sailors say ships not attacked in Tonkin Gulf Sailors say ships not attacked in Tonkin Gulf and then the article
[00:09:18.484 --> 00:09:28.806]  Quotes them, including senior officers, as saying that they were told not to talk about it, and that they believe it was a staged event.
[00:09:29.186 --> 00:09:31.107]  I think they even used false flags, they're Navy guys.
[00:09:34.127 --> 00:09:34.788]  See if you can get that.
[00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:36.388]  The internet's incredible.
[00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:37.208]  Okay.
[00:09:38.428 --> 00:09:40.629]  Side issue, I'm already digressing, but that's what I do.
[00:09:41.889 --> 00:09:43.030]  Going over the financial news.
[00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.251]  Dollars should be replaced as international standard.
[00:09:45.531 --> 00:09:56.679]  The UN report says, but don't worry, you'll still have the euro and the dollar, but now these bankers will be able to do even more currency manipulation, driving it up, driving it down, so they'll have the best of both worlds.
[00:09:56.699 --> 00:10:03.063]  They'll be able to manipulate currencies with insider trading to consolidate their power through fraud, but only select mega groups.
[00:10:03.483 --> 00:10:06.766]  They'll be able to buy up all their competition with that unfair advantage.
[00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:11.089]  It's more than unfair advantage, it's like straightjacketing the other football team and
[00:10:12.623 --> 00:10:25.344]  You know, tying them down so they can't walk and then running touchdowns back and forth for two hours, for four quarters, claiming that you, you know, beat them by 10,000 to zero.
[00:10:25.384 --> 00:10:27.007]  I mean, it's just asinine.
[00:10:28.314 --> 00:10:34.258]  And that's why all these scum are so arrogant, talking about how they're the master elite and we deserve to be slaves.
[00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:41.283]  And I guess in a way we do if we let a bunch of frauds, a bunch of Ken Lay Madoff types just openly rob everything.
[00:10:41.343 --> 00:10:47.086]  And I guess if the cops want to follow the orders and all the bureaucrats do and all the workers, then I guess you're going to get what you deserve.
[00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:48.387]  Go drink some fluoride on me.
[00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:52.730]  So to that ACDC song, have a drink on me!
[00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.691]  Have a drink on me!
[00:10:55.908 --> 00:10:57.569]  Have some fluoride on me!
[00:10:57.589 --> 00:11:04.695]  I mean, if you can't read the vaccine insert where it says it can give you cancer, brain damage you, and sterilize your butt, you don't care about your kids enough to read the insert.
[00:11:05.016 --> 00:11:08.278]  You stupid housewives out there, you stupid, stupid yuppie women.
[00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:18.968]  And I'm not saying women are stupid, but I'm talking about those particular stupid housewives and, and, and, and, um, soccer moms that shoot their kid up with every shot known to man and wonder why their 10-year-old kid can't hardly talk.
[00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:20.609]  You stupid witch.
[00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:21.710]  You stupid dingbat.
[00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:24.133]  Go read the stinking insert.
[00:11:24.354 --> 00:11:27.077]  And if calling you names is what it takes to get you to read something, I'll do it.
[00:11:27.337 --> 00:11:28.338]  I've learned sweet-talking.
[00:11:28.358 --> 00:11:29.700]  These people doesn't get anything done.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.883]  You gotta slap these people upside the head with a metaphorical two-by-four.
[00:11:33.284 --> 00:11:36.467]  And I will do it so you don't hurt your precious little children, you scum!
[00:11:37.108 --> 00:11:48.936]  And you, you, you, you scum out there that worship all these fake liberal groups like the NAACP that was set up and created so they could push eugenics on blacks and abortions on blacks.
[00:11:49.357 --> 00:11:53.240]  If you think killing black people's pro-black, then I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.624]  I mean, you gotta get mad, you gotta get angry, you gotta start seeing through just how crazy all this garbage is.
[00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:02.486]  Alright, I'm getting angry.
[00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:04.007]  I'm getting angry, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:04.027 --> 00:12:04.988]  I gotta settle down a little bit.
[00:12:06.912 --> 00:12:15.297]  I've decided starting in the middle of July, in just 12 days, when I make this announcement here now, I'm going to three hours instead of four.
[00:12:15.877 --> 00:12:24.482]  I've been doing four hours for two years, and I've just, I've got to build a new TV studio, I want to do a TV report every day, I've decided, and it just drains me too much the fourth hour.
[00:12:24.962 --> 00:12:27.223]  I need that energy to go into the TV show.
[00:12:27.764 --> 00:12:32.927]  Plus, I can say it all in three hours like I did for 13 years before I switched over to four hours.
[00:12:33.747 --> 00:12:35.909]  And we'll just re-air the first hour and the fourth hour.
[00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:38.812]  So if your station's already carrying the fourth hour, don't worry, it'll just be the first hour.
[00:12:39.332 --> 00:12:42.996]  So those adjustments will be made and the network sends my show out 24 hours a day on the satellite.
[00:12:44.297 --> 00:12:49.682]  But there was a reason I got into that issue as well.
[00:12:51.038 --> 00:13:02.045]  Oh, we're just going to start simulcasting the full three hours every day, so there's none of it that's not covered on PrisonPlanet.TV and then archived starting July 12th.
[00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:20.778]  We will be three hours a day and all three hours will be simulcast at PrisonPlanet.TV, if the hair lips the Admiral, if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek, because what happens is I tend to get in here and then rant in the first hour some of my best material and the most important info we cover.
[00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:27.203]  And then I tend to overheat by the fourth hour and just start babbling and
[00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:32.806]  I'll do stuff like comb my hair straight back in the morning and not even comb it.
[00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:38.230]  So I almost just have, don't air the first hour because I need to, I forget to comb my hair before I go on TV.
[00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.192]  So I'll just start having to get ready before I go live, getting here a little bit early.
[00:13:42.212 --> 00:13:49.197]  Because I'm the type of guy that gets out of the shower, combs my hair straight back, brush my teeth, shoot some deodorant on, put my socks on, put my clothes on.
[00:13:49.217 --> 00:13:52.179]  It takes me about seven, eight minutes to get showered, dressed, ready.
[00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.381]  And I've got to start converting over more to the TV mode.
[00:13:56.254 --> 00:13:59.076]  I may have to start going to the salon every day and having my hair done.
[00:13:59.977 --> 00:14:00.897]  That's a joke, folks.
[00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:02.258]  That's a joke.
[00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:07.542]  I've come here to kick butt and chew bubblegum when I'm all out of bubblegum.
[00:14:10.664 --> 00:14:15.147]  You've got to have some comic relief, my friends, when everything is disintegrating like it is.
[00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.007]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[00:14:16.328 --> 00:14:19.109]  Dollars should be replaced, as International Standard UN report says.
[00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.170]  This is high treason.
[00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:21.811]  And our government agrees.
[00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:22.632]  Geithner agrees.
[00:14:23.432 --> 00:14:24.373]  Obama agrees.
[00:14:24.413 --> 00:14:25.474]  Barry Sitaro agrees.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.281]  Here's another one.
[00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:30.642]  I've been covering this the last few days.
[00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:31.942]  A whole bunch of mainstream news.
[00:14:31.982 --> 00:14:33.443]  New York Times, Wall Street Journal.
[00:14:33.864 --> 00:14:35.505]  They all admit, okay, we're in a depression.
[00:14:35.565 --> 00:14:36.185]  Third depression.
[00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:41.388]  Fed officials avoid talk of further stimulus to stoke growth.
[00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:50.174]  Yeah, because they've already got a stimulus package passed that means unlimited money in an open window where they can go there every week if they want and get $887 million.
[00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:52.435]  That's an open revolving door.
[00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:54.796]  That's why Bloomberg reports it's
[00:14:55.936 --> 00:14:58.400]  You know, $28 trillion seven months ago.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.721]  We've never gotten new numbers since then.
[00:14:59.741 --> 00:15:05.970]  It's got to be something like $35 trillion now they've stolen domestically, but we don't know.
[00:15:06.491 --> 00:15:08.794]  And at a certain point, $24 trillion, $28 trillion, $35 trillion.
[00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:15.403]  It's like, do you want me to shoot you in the head a hundred times or a thousand times at a certain point?
[00:15:15.423 --> 00:15:17.284]  I mean, it just doesn't even matter.
[00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:22.688]  The level of fraud these delicate little geniuses have created, and I guess they are delicate geniuses.
[00:15:23.028 --> 00:15:33.574]  I guess the Goldman Sachs, Harvard scum, foreign intelligence operatives that run our country, the corporate intelligence operatives that have fully turned our government over to themselves, I guess they are better than us.
[00:15:33.614 --> 00:15:34.575]  I guess we do deserve it.
[00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:35.896]  I guess we are idiots.
[00:15:36.156 --> 00:15:37.517]  Well, I'm not an idiot, trash.
[00:15:38.598 --> 00:15:41.379]  And just like the founding fathers, I don't want to be your offshore slave.
[00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:45.660]  There's always going to be another minority that doesn't want to be a parasite that wants to be left alone.
[00:15:45.881 --> 00:15:51.522]  So, okay, you're a minority that's taking over all the mainline schmucks out there that want to suck their thumbs all day.
[00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:53.063]  I'm not one of them.
[00:15:53.663 --> 00:15:54.403]  You understand that?
[00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:56.064]  And I am not your property.
[00:15:56.304 --> 00:15:57.104]  I'm declaring it!
[00:15:57.344 --> 00:15:59.645]  You've drawn first blood in a thousand different ways.
[00:15:59.905 --> 00:16:01.486]  Get off my back, parasite!
[00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:04.367]  Because you're going to find out you're not the better man.
[00:16:05.782 --> 00:16:08.864]  You're gonna find out, like all bullies, that the bigger you are, the harder you're gonna fall.
[00:16:09.085 --> 00:16:14.889]  And I think you recognize now that people are angry, and there's no way for you to spin this, you little, you little pieces of crap.
[00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:23.076]  And you're gonna try to focus us in on Rooskies and Chi-Coms and, oh yeah, the, you know, Chi-Coms especially are a threat, a threat you created!
[00:16:23.096 --> 00:16:34.325]  And you're gonna try to focus us in on all these other enemies and little turban-head brown people that you funded and created, so we'll give up all our rights to you so you can rape us financially and physically.
[00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:38.689]  But we know it's a corporate globalist treason takeover.
[00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.752]  Corporations are bigger than governments, more powerful, and that's what the New World Order is.
[00:16:44.012 --> 00:16:46.093]  And we are calling you out, trash.
[00:16:48.914 --> 00:16:52.196]  In fact, on the subject of BP, before I get back to the economy, I'm going to get more into BP later.
[00:16:53.516 --> 00:16:57.658]  I've been hearing for the last month, and I really haven't covered it, and I should, everybody should buy from BP.
[00:16:57.978 --> 00:17:00.800]  Obama's being mean to them, and it's going to hurt the station owners.
[00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:05.970]  Well, most BP stations are owned by the company.
[00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:11.391]  They're not franchises like Valero or something, or some of the other companies that are out there.
[00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:15.492]  Most of them are owned by the parent mafia organization that's completely owned by big banks.
[00:17:16.092 --> 00:17:17.492]  BP is just a front company.
[00:17:17.852 --> 00:17:18.292]  On record.
[00:17:19.532 --> 00:17:20.693]  Basically British intelligence.
[00:17:21.093 --> 00:17:23.073]  They used BP employees to overthrow Iran in 1953.
[00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:24.593]  That's on record.
[00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:26.074]  Operation Ajax declassified in 1999.
[00:17:30.345 --> 00:17:32.766]  BP created Obama with Goldman Sachs.
[00:17:33.026 --> 00:17:33.807]  It's one and the same.
[00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:35.427]  Goldman Sachs owns BP.
[00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:36.708]  The biggest shareholder.
[00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:40.669]  They created the carbon tax with Ken Lay and Enron.
[00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.950]  On record, the mid-90s with Al Gore.
[00:17:46.012 --> 00:17:49.313]  But the fake Republicans are acting like Obama's hurting them.
[00:17:50.234 --> 00:17:51.034]  Hurting BP.
[00:17:51.114 --> 00:17:53.135]  Playing along with the fake left-right paradigm.
[00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:54.375]  It makes me sick!
[00:17:54.876 --> 00:17:55.476]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:57.375 --> 00:18:05.281]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[00:18:57.099 --> 00:18:58.340]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.744]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:19:03.984 --> 00:19:08.607]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:19:09.007 --> 00:19:09.408]  It's true.
[00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:14.031]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:19.276]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:19:19.796 --> 00:19:26.723]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:19:26.923 --> 00:19:27.824]  And here's the best part.
[00:19:28.025 --> 00:19:34.391]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:19:41.054 --> 00:19:41.234]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:19:41.254 --> 00:19:44.196]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:19:44.696 --> 00:19:46.437]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:57.116 --> 00:20:00.157]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:00.497 --> 00:20:04.119]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:04.399 --> 00:20:07.860]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[00:21:02.145 --> 00:21:05.327]  If you want to gamble, I tell you I'm your man.
[00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:07.508]  You win some, you lose some.
[00:21:07.888 --> 00:21:10.889]  It's all a game to me!
[00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:20.834]  Alright, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:22.755 --> 00:21:25.656]  I didn't get into all of the news on the economy.
[00:21:26.737 --> 00:21:30.259]  I'll continue covering that in the next hour and then get into the oil spill.
[00:21:31.328 --> 00:21:32.469]  We're good to go.
[00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:49.014]  Because that lady came out in Houston and said George W. raped her and she was dead a week later.
[00:21:49.454 --> 00:21:50.034]  Suicide.
[00:21:50.754 --> 00:21:53.515]  The evidence did show that she'd worked in and around him.
[00:21:54.175 --> 00:21:58.156]  The Bushes have had a lot of maids die, get run over, get killed, be found dead on the beach.
[00:21:58.816 --> 00:22:00.797]  In Georgia, in Maine, in Texas.
[00:22:01.797 --> 00:22:05.318]  You don't want to be a domestic servant of the Bushes and make them mad because
[00:22:07.551 --> 00:22:10.877]  You don't want to write a book about Bush being a cokehead during the election.
[00:22:10.897 --> 00:22:11.798]  It didn't matter after.
[00:22:11.818 --> 00:22:16.145]  You're going to slit your wrist, boy, and be found dead in a bathtub in Arkansas.
[00:22:17.507 --> 00:22:20.733]  It's one of their favorite places to kill people because that state is so corrupt.
[00:22:22.737 --> 00:22:23.877]  Every state's corrupt though.
[00:22:23.937 --> 00:22:29.419]  Illinois, Texas, Arkansas, West Virginia, New York, Florida.
[00:22:29.719 --> 00:22:31.660]  Everybody always says, man, that's a corrupt state.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.000]  Michigan, California, that's a corrupt state.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:34.920]  Oregon, they're corrupt.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.241]  Nevada, they're corrupt.
[00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:38.001]  New Mexico, they're corrupt.
[00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:39.602]  New Hampshire, man, they're corrupt.
[00:22:39.622 --> 00:22:40.622]  They're all corrupt.
[00:22:43.463 --> 00:22:47.464]  So I'm gonna go to your phone calls and just go through those from
[00:22:48.945 --> 00:23:05.260]  Mark and Ernie and Matt and Scott and Frank and then we will continue with all of the news and Kagan they're asking your softball questions if she's a fan of the show Twilight and I can't believe she even knew what they were talking about I had to look it up at some werewolf show or something I mean
[00:23:10.247 --> 00:23:15.509]  But they knew that was a way, because the first couple days she never smiled, so they started like throwing her softballs.
[00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:19.451]  And then she looked even crazier after that with these fake smiles, like the Joker.
[00:23:20.872 --> 00:23:22.512]  Hi, I'm Elena Kagan.
[00:23:24.693 --> 00:23:26.374]  Do I like werewolves or vampires?
[00:23:26.394 --> 00:23:28.755]  Well, gee, I actually like Igor.
[00:23:28.775 --> 00:23:30.056]  That's more of what I'm into.
[00:23:31.156 --> 00:23:32.157]  Igor's a little helper.
[00:23:33.057 --> 00:23:36.639]  We'll have nine Igors on the court with rolling pins, not gavels.
[00:23:37.711 --> 00:23:39.872]  Me and the girls will all go out and have fun together.
[00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.153]  We like to go to the topless bar together.
[00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:45.374]  All right, I'm sorry.
[00:23:45.414 --> 00:23:50.737]  I need to quit screwing around, don't I, a little bit.
[00:23:50.757 --> 00:23:53.678]  We're going to go to break here and go directly to your calls when we start the next hour.
[00:23:53.978 --> 00:24:00.061]  I do want to just tell listeners that, you know, I have trouble with this news.
[00:24:00.101 --> 00:24:00.721]  It's so heavy.
[00:24:00.761 --> 00:24:01.501]  It's so hardcore.
[00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:02.582]  We're on the verge of World War III.
[00:24:05.202 --> 00:24:11.469]  The oil with the hurricanes is on its way, and the way they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off is hysterical about a little bit of oil.
[00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:17.736]  And the government's blocking the cleanup out in the Gulf, just waiting for the hurricanes to blow in the oil so they can have their crisis.
[00:24:18.777 --> 00:24:24.964]  And the banking takeover of every financial institution and any organization that, quote, affects the economy.
[00:24:26.397 --> 00:24:28.599]  And all the crazy legislation about arresting U.S.
[00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:31.781]  citizens for no reason, and the end of the Internet.
[00:24:32.342 --> 00:24:32.682]  You know what?
[00:24:33.242 --> 00:24:36.465]  I do tend to start getting a little bit smart-mouthed and arrogant and angry.
[00:24:36.485 --> 00:24:39.167]  And I've really got to try to control myself.
[00:24:39.427 --> 00:24:41.349]  And that's why I'm down on myself a little bit.
[00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:49.435]  Because nobody's perfect, and I realize the position I'm in, and I need to be focused.
[00:24:49.455 --> 00:24:50.316]  So I will pledge this.
[00:24:50.936 --> 00:24:54.119]  The next two hours will be serious, like a focused laser beam.
[00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:56.072]  I've been pretty serious.
[00:24:56.112 --> 00:25:00.837]  I screw around less than most hosts, but I am screwing around, and I've got to be my own governor.
[00:25:00.857 --> 00:25:04.381]  In fact, guys in the control room, tell me right now, no more screwing around.
[00:25:06.384 --> 00:25:07.385]  No more screwing around.
[00:25:07.465 --> 00:25:10.588]  So it's going to be Mr. Serious coming up in the next two hours.
[00:25:10.949 --> 00:25:12.250]  It's just this stuff's so absurd.
[00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.634]  I mean, that clown Kagan up there, like a demonic penguin,
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.680]  It's just made for humor, but it's not funny.
[00:25:21.581 --> 00:25:22.701]  It's gallows humor is what it is.
[00:25:22.901 --> 00:25:25.581]  Don't forget the online video bookstores at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:25.621 --> 00:25:32.023]  Not only are the best and most informative titles there to wake up your friends and family, but it also supports us when you buy the books, t-shirts, and materials.
[00:25:32.603 --> 00:25:34.663]  They want to shut down alternative media for a reason.
[00:25:34.683 --> 00:25:35.763]  This stuff's hurting them.
[00:25:39.064 --> 00:25:41.124]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:26:52.288 --> 00:26:55.129]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:01.852 --> 00:27:02.512]  Big Brother.
[00:27:03.153 --> 00:27:04.213]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:04.933 --> 00:27:06.094]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:06.114 --> 00:27:07.514]  You want answers?
[00:27:08.275 --> 00:27:09.255]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:09.815 --> 00:27:13.477]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:14.017 --> 00:27:18.079]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:19.881 --> 00:27:21.842]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:21.862 --> 00:27:24.603]  We've reached the halfway point in worldwide transmission.
[00:27:24.623 --> 00:27:36.468]  We're simulcasting the radio broadcast that's on XM, AM and FM stations, Global, Shortwave, other satellite systems, the internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with the free audio streams.
[00:27:37.688 --> 00:27:40.969]  We also simulcast a video stream at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.950]  Okay, I'm going to your calls for 30 minutes.
[00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:44.931]  I'll continue with calls into the next hour.
[00:27:45.251 --> 00:27:47.092]  Ron Paul's scheduled to join us for a half hour.
[00:27:48.766 --> 00:27:50.807]  But he may come on at the start of the hour or the end of the hour.
[00:27:50.967 --> 00:27:52.108]  He's got votes coming up.
[00:27:52.448 --> 00:27:53.969]  Congress is in session right now.
[00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.391]  So Ron Paul coming up with key info next hour.
[00:27:57.892 --> 00:28:02.014]  The Federal Elections Commission is trying to persecute him right now as well.
[00:28:02.294 --> 00:28:07.457]  He's calling this a premeditated, illegitimate attack, trying to shut down our free speech.
[00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:08.258]  So that's coming up.
[00:28:09.158 --> 00:28:09.759]  The economy.
[00:28:11.172 --> 00:28:16.136]  The Iran situation, the oil, the Al Gore criminal investigation opened for basically rape.
[00:28:16.156 --> 00:28:21.940]  I mean, you start trying to make a woman have sex with you and grabbing on her parts, that's sexual assault.
[00:28:22.461 --> 00:28:23.842]  And you know what?
[00:28:23.862 --> 00:28:24.462]  I think he did it.
[00:28:24.482 --> 00:28:25.263]  I think she's credible.
[00:28:26.502 --> 00:28:31.243]  I mean, you investigate for 15 years every day intensely, you get a feel for these things.
[00:28:31.904 --> 00:28:38.446]  I don't say we can put him away for it yet, but he just looks like a big fat rapist, but he likes to rape our freedom.
[00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:40.826]  He's a lying fraud with the carbon tax.
[00:28:41.647 --> 00:28:43.807]  He was a lying fraud with the cap and trade.
[00:28:43.847 --> 00:28:44.527]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:45.848]  It's coming up.
[00:28:46.608 --> 00:28:47.088]  It's coming up.
[00:28:47.648 --> 00:28:49.149]  Mark in New York, you're on the air.
[00:28:49.189 --> 00:28:49.769]  Thanks for holding.
[00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.969]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:51.069 --> 00:28:53.271]  Eight years plus since I talked to you last.
[00:28:53.311 --> 00:28:55.013]  Southwestern New York.
[00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:59.416]  I wanted to call and tell you about a meeting I attended last night.
[00:29:00.937 --> 00:29:06.502]  It turned out to be an organization, mostly I would say of neocons, called GO.
[00:29:06.522 --> 00:29:18.011]  This is not a promotion of their dot com, but it stands for Get Out of Our House, which was basically another neocon circled jerk, as far as I was concerned.
[00:29:19.964 --> 00:29:22.706]  Asking loaded questions about con cons.
[00:29:24.507 --> 00:29:31.010]  You know, whether we should amend the Constitution to exclude people with law degrees from serving in the House of Representatives.
[00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.111]  Yeah, that's a red herring.
[00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:32.851]  You can't do that.
[00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:38.834]  I mean, the problem is a con con, once you open a constitutional convention up, everything's on the table.
[00:29:38.854 --> 00:29:40.075]  That's right.
[00:29:40.355 --> 00:29:45.878]  And guaranteed the globalists would stage a terror attack and during the hysteria abolish everything.
[00:29:45.938 --> 00:29:47.179]  A con con is deadly.
[00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:49.260]  That's what I told them.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.241]  Hey, can I give a shout-out to my son in Wisconsin, Justin?
[00:29:55.481 --> 00:30:00.822]  He's 29 today, and he woke up on his own a half-dozen years ago.
[00:30:01.362 --> 00:30:01.982]  God bless him.
[00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:03.682]  Well, good.
[00:30:03.722 --> 00:30:06.003]  Were you awake first, Mark, or did your son wake up?
[00:30:07.443 --> 00:30:17.405]  I started in 99, and lost contact, and lo and behold, two years ago, I found out he was right in line.
[00:30:19.278 --> 00:30:20.098]  Well, that's awesome.
[00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:20.939]  God bless you, sir.
[00:30:20.979 --> 00:30:25.780]  It's good to know that your son is not psychologically enslaved by the corporate Borg.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.941]  Let's talk to Ernie in California.
[00:30:28.001 --> 00:30:28.821]  Ernie, you're on the air.
[00:30:29.581 --> 00:30:30.301]  Hey, Alex.
[00:30:31.602 --> 00:30:34.723]  Every time I go to the store, I try to tell people about aspartame and fluoride.
[00:30:34.743 --> 00:30:37.324]  And if they give me the dumb look, then I tell them the third thing.
[00:30:37.344 --> 00:30:40.565]  Einstein said one thing.
[00:30:40.585 --> 00:30:41.965]  Two things are infinite.
[00:30:42.245 --> 00:30:43.405]  Space and stupidity.
[00:30:43.646 --> 00:30:44.686]  And then I walk away from him.
[00:30:45.326 --> 00:30:48.129]  But the other thing I want to talk about is the web bot.
[00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:54.314]  I don't know if you're interested in that, but it's talking about a possible 1.2 billion dead from Gulf oil spill.
[00:30:54.675 --> 00:30:59.859]  And also, this has been in Book of Revelations, the Hopi Prophecy, the 7th sign.
[00:30:59.879 --> 00:31:06.265]  Let me see, Edgar Cayce wrote about it, and a few other people, including that shaman that's in Africa, what's his name?
[00:31:06.746 --> 00:31:08.727]  Credo Mutwa, or something like that.
[00:31:09.628 --> 00:31:10.169]  Basically,
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.861]  I just think early eugenics programs are already into effect, big time, with this oil spill.
[00:31:17.462 --> 00:31:18.982]  And I want to get your take on that.
[00:31:19.322 --> 00:31:20.182]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[00:31:20.202 --> 00:31:21.743]  Let me come back and give you my take on it.
[00:31:21.823 --> 00:31:29.225]  But I've known people, we've interviewed activists who print up little cards with a couple of fluoride
[00:31:31.581 --> 00:31:39.148]  Websites that have facts on them, fluoride's deadly, and they put it in fluoride water, you know, containers for kids at the grocery store.
[00:31:39.849 --> 00:31:46.235]  But now, they don't just put Aspartame and Diet Coke and Pepsi, it's in tens of thousands of products, it's in almost all the candy.
[00:31:46.635 --> 00:31:52.901]  So you just go in the grocery store and stick those cards in the candy aisle, and you will save people's lives.
[00:31:53.562 --> 00:31:55.704]  Desperate things mean desperate measures.
[00:31:56.946 --> 00:32:00.790]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:32:56.502 --> 00:32:58.804]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:32:58.884 --> 00:33:01.107]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:33:01.207 --> 00:33:03.989]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:09.174]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:33:09.515 --> 00:33:13.719]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:33:14.019 --> 00:33:16.381]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:33:16.481 --> 00:33:18.902]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:33:19.262 --> 00:33:21.824]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:33:22.164 --> 00:33:29.769]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:33:30.103 --> 00:33:35.406]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:33:35.506 --> 00:33:38.287]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:33:38.347 --> 00:33:41.789]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.949]  And I got news for you.
[00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:44.410]  You're everyone else.
[00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.551]  Invisible Empire.

[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.080]  Thank you!
[00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:04.933]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:35:05.533 --> 00:35:08.594]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:15.035 --> 00:35:20.357]  When you read State Department Memorandum 200 by Henry Kissinger in 73, declassified in 93,
[00:35:23.951 --> 00:35:33.960]  They talk about using wars and famine, and if an African country or Latin American country starts industrializing and becoming wealthy, that they would finance rebels to overthrow the government.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.684]  And that if countries wanted their IMF and World Bank loans, they would have to cut their population growth by 50%.
[00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:46.150]  That's just one of many documents, but that's one that's well known, you can look up and read the whole text of.
[00:35:49.072 --> 00:35:49.233]  Now,
[00:35:50.663 --> 00:35:53.752]  People are saying, well, this Gulf thing is the beginning of the eugenics.
[00:35:54.273 --> 00:35:56.579]  And that the oil's gonna kill everybody, basically.
[00:35:59.514 --> 00:36:06.080]  All the eugenics and the soft kill that we've seen, again, soft kill is something that kills you 20 years later, so you don't know what kills you.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.781]  You don't know what caused the disease.
[00:36:08.262 --> 00:36:18.631]  You don't understand the underlying chemical or biological precursors or binary systems that mix together to create that degenerative disease.
[00:36:19.211 --> 00:36:24.616]  But the establishment scientists tested on guinea pigs, rats, pigs, and it's almost 100% what affects them will affect us.
[00:36:26.638 --> 00:36:27.538]  The exact same way.
[00:36:27.678 --> 00:36:30.239]  Pigs, guinea pigs, mice, rabbits are similar.
[00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:31.919]  That's why they use them as lab animals.
[00:36:32.459 --> 00:36:36.140]  And so they've figured all this out, exactly how to soft kill us.
[00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:38.761]  But humans are very resilient, very strong.
[00:36:39.101 --> 00:36:40.061]  We're omnivores.
[00:36:40.361 --> 00:36:42.382]  We're designed to be able to take on a lot of poisons.
[00:36:42.782 --> 00:36:43.822]  We're long-lived.
[00:36:44.082 --> 00:36:44.643]  We're tough.
[00:36:45.043 --> 00:36:46.383]  We're tough as nails.
[00:36:47.443 --> 00:36:47.803]  Okay?
[00:36:48.784 --> 00:36:50.304]  And we're a lot tougher than a rat.
[00:36:50.384 --> 00:36:51.144]  And rats are tough.
[00:36:53.485 --> 00:36:54.165]  Pigs are tough.
[00:36:55.882 --> 00:36:58.024]  And that's just what we're closest to genetically.
[00:36:58.725 --> 00:37:08.394]  Not in our DNA, but in the way our bodies deal with chemicals and toxins is porcine pigs and rodents.
[00:37:08.454 --> 00:37:09.495]  But side issue.
[00:37:10.997 --> 00:37:20.166]  The Gulf is the primary ignition device to get the carbon taxes passed that they openly admit, even in CNN, is to fund the global SDR.
[00:37:22.162 --> 00:37:34.368]  Which is this new UN-IMF World Bank bank-issued cashless money, where they just create tens of trillions, and then your government has to denominate their currencies in that.
[00:37:34.888 --> 00:37:43.332]  That is, your currency is pegged to that and controlled by that, and then you pay taxes to the bankers to give value to the currency.
[00:37:44.676 --> 00:37:57.742]  And it's a debt system where they create more currency and more credit and more debt than there is actual physical money or jobs to pay it back, where it's mathematically impossible to ever get ahead.
[00:37:59.182 --> 00:38:02.144]  And so it's designed to render you down to slaves.
[00:38:02.404 --> 00:38:05.505]  So they've totally enslaved us now with the domestic operation.
[00:38:05.525 --> 00:38:08.026]  They've done it to every country they control, almost every nation.
[00:38:08.226 --> 00:38:11.568]  They're mopping up the few they don't, Russia, North Korea,
[00:38:13.147 --> 00:38:19.472]  Iran, Libya, Somalia, whether those countries are good or bad, the point is they're being taken over by the board.
[00:38:19.732 --> 00:38:20.733]  They're the last to fall.
[00:38:21.794 --> 00:38:28.579]  And now they need the Gulf disaster for it to go on for six months a year.
[00:38:28.599 --> 00:38:29.900]  They're saying it may go on for two years.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:41.349]  And they need it to not let the big ships that can scoop all the oil up, scoop it up, because then the hurricanes can't blow in and drive it into the estuaries and cause a real crisis and some evacuations to set the precedent.
[00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:52.257]  The President can grandstand as our savior, and they can then say, see, we've got to have carbon taxes, oil's bad, we've got to seize the economy, tell you what type of car you can drive, what type of industry.
[00:38:52.878 --> 00:39:03.927]  Here's an article today, give me a close shot please, gentlemen, from the London Telegraph, and it says, prices rise as New Zealand passes emissions trading scheme.
[00:39:04.407 --> 00:39:10.152]  Petrol and power prices have risen sharply in New Zealand after the government introduced a controversial emissions trading scheme.
[00:39:11.601 --> 00:39:13.442]  And they've gone up massively, it says.
[00:39:14.283 --> 00:39:24.691]  Now, understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the day they passed it, the next week it went up 3 to 5 percent, and it's forecast to go up as much as 20 percent.
[00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:29.314]  Now, we have the newscast where they're not saying it's bad.
[00:39:29.774 --> 00:39:34.418]  They're national news in Australia saying half the land in Australia is now off-limits.
[00:39:35.678 --> 00:39:44.522]  By not letting farmers farm on half their land nationwide, and not letting new land be developed, this cuts our carbon credit and Australia gets five billion dollars or whatever.
[00:39:45.402 --> 00:39:47.383]  And it just shows people going, it's over, I'm bankrupt.
[00:39:47.703 --> 00:39:51.845]  And the government's there going, don't worry, we have a program to buy your land at five cents on the dollar.
[00:39:53.857 --> 00:39:55.698]  I mean, this is Mafia takeover.
[00:39:55.718 --> 00:40:02.101]  It's like the Mafia just lands in, say, East Texas and says, Eh, you can't farm no more!
[00:40:02.301 --> 00:40:04.302]  And you gotta pay taxes to me now!
[00:40:04.622 --> 00:40:05.523]  It's for the Earth!
[00:40:06.083 --> 00:40:06.943]  Oh, you don't like it?
[00:40:07.143 --> 00:40:08.584]  There was an oil spill!
[00:40:12.886 --> 00:40:13.747]  Oh, God help us.
[00:40:17.669 --> 00:40:18.329]  But the caller...
[00:40:20.543 --> 00:40:20.663]  Well,
[00:40:40.586 --> 00:40:41.707]  High infant mortality.
[00:40:41.768 --> 00:40:42.709]  Babies died a lot.
[00:40:42.949 --> 00:40:44.050]  Women died in childbirth.
[00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.192]  You take those statistics out.
[00:40:45.472 --> 00:40:47.594]  We're living on average about eight years less than we were.
[00:40:47.855 --> 00:40:48.976]  And it'd be even less than that.
[00:40:49.036 --> 00:40:50.538]  They kill you with the soft kill weapons.
[00:40:50.558 --> 00:40:51.159]  They weaken you.
[00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:58.427]  And then they have all these expensive treatments that the drug companies and others suck all the money out of you at the end of your life with.
[00:40:59.204 --> 00:41:00.165]  It's all set up.
[00:41:01.106 --> 00:41:11.935]  It's estimated people lived about 61, men 61, women 65 is the number I saw last week by the American Medical Association, if they didn't have all this medicine and all these surgeries and all these drugs.
[00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:14.097]  So they keep you alive like Darth Vader.
[00:41:14.498 --> 00:41:22.465]  They make you sick, then give you Darth Vader prosthesis to keep you alive, and then suck all your wealth that you've made over your life into their coffers.
[00:41:22.765 --> 00:41:24.446]  It's all scientifically designed.
[00:41:24.827 --> 00:41:26.768]  The doctors are compartmentalized and don't see it.
[00:41:27.028 --> 00:41:29.430]  A lot of them are starting to, though, like Dr. Blaylock and others.
[00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:31.752]  The more prestigious, the more they understand it.
[00:41:32.152 --> 00:41:43.481]  That's why they're prestigious, because they can think in a multifaceted, multivariate, three-dimensional tie-in system through historical, scientific, anthropological integration.
[00:41:43.922 --> 00:41:46.724]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in New York.
[00:41:46.744 --> 00:41:47.444]  You're on the air, Matt.
[00:41:48.545 --> 00:41:49.746]  Alex, great to talk to you.
[00:41:49.926 --> 00:41:50.567]  Great to talk to you.
[00:41:52.043 --> 00:41:53.585]  I had a couple of quick things for you.
[00:41:53.665 --> 00:42:03.551]  I don't know if you'd get a chance to listen to the Financial Cents News Hour, but for the past couple of weeks, people have been calling in and nominating you to debate Matt Simmons on Pete Boyle.
[00:42:04.152 --> 00:42:09.575]  And that's something they talk about there frequently, and I hope they get in touch with you, and I hope you take them up on it.
[00:42:09.835 --> 00:42:10.856]  I hope they're able to.
[00:42:10.876 --> 00:42:18.341]  I was told Opie and Anthony tried to get ahold of us for a week, and I've got actually good guys in there now trying to go through all the... We get 5,000 emails a day, 400, 500 phone calls.
[00:42:22.103 --> 00:42:23.724]  And we're trying to sort through it all.
[00:42:24.024 --> 00:42:28.026]  It'd be nice if certain people didn't call the office 30, 40, 50 times a day.
[00:42:28.406 --> 00:42:32.428]  We've probably got a hundred people that literally call sometimes 50 times a day.
[00:42:32.868 --> 00:42:34.469]  So we're sorting through all that insanity.
[00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:40.232]  But yes, what's the media request email so I can just give that out specifically?
[00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:47.253]  Yeah, we'll get that for you.
[00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:48.295]  We're so on top of it.
[00:42:48.355 --> 00:42:52.641]  Something else I wanted to bring up was with this oil still going on as long as it has.
[00:42:52.661 --> 00:42:55.024]  How come I haven't heard anything about the law of the Sea Treaty?
[00:42:55.545 --> 00:42:58.549]  It sounds like that would be exactly where this is going.
[00:42:59.488 --> 00:43:21.095]  Well actually they've been trying to ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty and this International Gun Grab Treaty to where you pay a tax worldwide to travel on the ocean and even our inland waterways will be under UN control just like in NAFTA and GATT we've given up our trade control or through NATO given up lots of our military control or through these other systems to corporate bodies.
[00:43:21.995 --> 00:43:23.555]  But that's another great point you raised.
[00:43:23.596 --> 00:43:29.757]  They are proposing the carbon tax, which is an international treaty, which does actually tie into the Law of the Sea.
[00:43:30.297 --> 00:43:36.359]  I mean, what does the Law of the Sea and what does a carbon tax have to do with stopping the leak?
[00:43:36.539 --> 00:43:36.899]  Nothing!
[00:43:37.099 --> 00:43:44.161]  But that's what Obama has proposed, and he's blocked foreign ships that could scoop the oil up until it's too late and all that oil comes ashore.
[00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:45.041]  But great points.
[00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:45.521]  Anything else?
[00:43:46.202 --> 00:43:49.763]  You always bring the treaty up first, and then the crisis comes later.
[00:43:49.983 --> 00:43:51.083]  And now we see the crisis.
[00:43:52.461 --> 00:44:00.444]  Um, one other thing I also wanted to say was I think it was two years ago that, uh, right after Bilderberg, uh, John Edwards got burned in the media.
[00:44:00.464 --> 00:44:02.564]  You know, his relationship got outed.
[00:44:02.624 --> 00:44:06.425]  And right now, as soon as Bilderberg let out, I see Al Gore is in the same spot.
[00:44:06.445 --> 00:44:07.786]  I wonder if you have any thoughts on that.
[00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:12.667]  Continue.
[00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:15.808]  Uh, no, that's all I got for you.
[00:44:16.088 --> 00:44:16.408]  All right.
[00:44:16.428 --> 00:44:17.529]  I appreciate your call.
[00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:18.329]  Good to hear from you.
[00:44:18.669 --> 00:44:20.370]  Let's talk to Scott in Washington.
[00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.210]  Scott, you're on the air.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:40.587]  Yeah, Alex, there's several points, and this has been pissing me off all week, that I'd like to bring up about the former, now departed late Grand Dragon KKK member Robert Byrd, to begin with, and especially to address that caller that left that message on your board.
[00:44:41.268 --> 00:44:50.911]  You know, so-called Mr. Constitution, you know, you may want to remind him that, number one, this is the same guy that also voted for the Patriot Act, number one.
[00:44:51.212 --> 00:44:52.152]  Oh, I forgot about that!
[00:44:52.802 --> 00:44:53.543]  Yeah, he did.
[00:44:53.563 --> 00:45:12.638]  That's number one, so this so-called Patriot stuff, and as far as him talking about the NAACP, listen, black people have been calling them out for the latter part of the 20th century for being the race-pimping and poverty-pimping organization that they are, so that means absolutely nothing.
[00:45:13.459 --> 00:45:22.346]  I will tell you myself, I as the black man, especially, am offended by the way these phony, two-faced white liberals are sitting around here
[00:45:22.836 --> 00:45:24.177]  Crying over this guy.
[00:45:24.197 --> 00:45:25.597]  This is the same guy.
[00:45:25.617 --> 00:45:34.661]  Now, they had the nerve to sit there and lambast Rand Paul because of one point of the Civil Rights Act that he might have objected to.
[00:45:35.171 --> 00:45:48.236]  This is the same guy that filibustered it, and not only that, was not only just a member of the KKK, but a Grand Cyclops, a recruiter, and possible murderer in the KKK.
[00:45:48.276 --> 00:45:52.757]  Well, he also said that he didn't want blacks to be in the military next to white people.
[00:45:54.338 --> 00:45:59.520]  Exactly, and you know what happened, and when I say possible murderer, as far as lynchings in the KKK,
[00:46:00.376 --> 00:46:08.361]  You know, you remember when that thing happened with Strom Thurmond, that whole debacle with Trent Locke, that comment that he made after his 100th birthday?
[00:46:08.802 --> 00:46:15.946]  And there were a bunch of black Republican activists that actually protested Robert Byrd and brought up his KKK days.
[00:46:16.747 --> 00:46:24.772]  And one of the buildings that they said, and I don't remember which one it was, but Robert Byrd had sent a staffer down there.
[00:46:25.888 --> 00:46:29.770]  And this was reported in Newsmax, and this was around 2003, and they asked him... Stay there!
[00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.311]  I want to hear about this when we come back.
[00:46:31.812 --> 00:46:32.832]  Come back and tell us about it.
[00:46:32.852 --> 00:46:34.854]  I don't want to get into a Robert Byrd bashing fest.
[00:46:34.874 --> 00:46:39.076]  I mean, he's dead, 90-something years old, the father of Port Merrill.
[00:46:39.737 --> 00:46:45.120]  He voted for the Patriot Act, and I'm supposed to worship him because the media told West Virginians he represented them.
[00:46:46.001 --> 00:46:47.522]  You know, my issue is...
[00:46:48.402 --> 00:46:52.453]  That I'm against Robert Byrd because he's a globalist.
[00:46:53.035 --> 00:46:56.544]  And he's dead now, so it's a non-issue, but we'll let you finish up on the other side.
[00:46:58.049 --> 00:46:58.929]  Global meltdowns.
[00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.330]  Massive unemployment.
[00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.491]  Endless wars.
[00:47:01.911 --> 00:47:03.171]  A new currency crisis.
[00:47:03.551 --> 00:47:05.292]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:47:05.632 --> 00:47:07.493]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:47:07.793 --> 00:47:09.414]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:47:09.694 --> 00:47:11.395]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[00:47:11.775 --> 00:47:13.356]  Introducing Off The Grid News.

[00:47:25.521 --> 00:47:27.442]  Off The Grid News is fiercely independent

[00:47:57.318 --> 00:48:02.182]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:48:02.282 --> 00:48:03.063]  What have we got?
[00:48:03.283 --> 00:48:05.405]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:48:05.725 --> 00:48:06.466]  A republic.
[00:48:06.746 --> 00:48:09.308]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:48:09.388 --> 00:48:11.290]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:13.552]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:14.953]  So they think they own our land?
[00:48:15.353 --> 00:48:16.474]  They think they own our water?
[00:48:16.675 --> 00:48:17.075]  Children?
[00:48:17.275 --> 00:48:18.056]  Our education?
[00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:19.017]  Our money?
[00:48:19.237 --> 00:48:22.900]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.904]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:48:26.924 --> 00:48:27.906]  You're being warned.
[00:48:28.206 --> 00:48:29.047]  We have the facts.
[00:48:29.247 --> 00:48:30.348]  We have the Constitution.
[00:48:30.409 --> 00:48:31.290]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:32.131]  We have common law.
[00:48:32.191 --> 00:48:34.453]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:34.714 --> 00:48:38.498]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:48:38.598 --> 00:48:43.381]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:48:43.562 --> 00:48:44.922]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:48:45.063 --> 00:48:45.903]  Don't tread on me.

[00:49:26.923 --> 00:49:28.044]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:49:28.204 --> 00:49:32.587]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:49:32.767 --> 00:49:38.471]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:49:38.571 --> 00:49:41.993]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:49:42.213 --> 00:49:44.815]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:50:01.115 --> 00:50:04.906]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:09.774]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:50:10.034 --> 00:50:11.975]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:50:12.135 --> 00:50:13.437]  Made me feel breathless.
[00:50:13.857 --> 00:50:17.880]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.321]  Nothing did anything.
[00:50:19.381 --> 00:50:23.324]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:50:23.344 --> 00:50:26.807]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:50:27.468 --> 00:50:30.070]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:35.194]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.

[00:50:46.264 --> 00:50:47.805]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:02.483 --> 00:51:25.531]  She saw her after school Sippin' on a coke Actin' like a fool Crackin' crazy jokes She turned his motor on Man, his heart was gone Fire down below He was a cyclops, she enclaimed him
[00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:33.344]  Easy as you go Cyclops, ruler, sinner, bird.
[00:51:35.226 --> 00:51:39.248]  Say hi to Choron for me when you cross the River Styx.
[00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:43.490]  Okay, we're back live ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:48.293]  Anybody that calls their leaders wizards, dragons, cyclopses.
[00:51:49.414 --> 00:51:53.076]  It was the founder of the Klan who was also a Confederate general.
[00:51:54.737 --> 00:52:02.743]  Uh, who was, uh, the head of the Illuminati, Albert Pike, this is on record, who talked about how there'd be three world wars.
[00:52:04.205 --> 00:52:08.348]  The first with the Germans, the second with the Germans, the third starting in the Middle East.
[00:52:08.368 --> 00:52:09.529]  This is on record.
[00:52:10.612 --> 00:52:13.495]  Now, I'm not saying I was against the South in the Civil War.
[00:52:13.535 --> 00:52:14.877]  That was a different thing entirely.
[00:52:14.917 --> 00:52:18.120]  British intelligence came in and manipulated the South into the war.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:18.861]  This is on record.
[00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:20.883]  And manipulated the North into the war.
[00:52:21.143 --> 00:52:25.107]  Then they put British troops in Canada and Toronto and threatened to invade.
[00:52:25.848 --> 00:52:30.011]  So it's not this side's good, that side's good, or this side's good, that side's bad.
[00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:31.212]  It's all sides.
[00:52:31.613 --> 00:52:36.517]  You need to analyze things and not think of it as black and white when you're looking at how the globalists are manipulating groups.
[00:52:36.557 --> 00:52:38.618]  But I don't want to get off into these discussions.
[00:52:39.699 --> 00:52:43.842]  It's just that Robert Burr did vote for the Patriot Act and a lot of other bad stuff.
[00:52:43.883 --> 00:52:45.003]  He voted for some good stuff.
[00:52:45.764 --> 00:52:47.706]  And I think as he got older, you know, he got better.
[00:52:48.866 --> 00:52:53.830]  But, you know, he presided for 60 years over the Senate
[00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:56.591]  Well, America went to hell in a handbasket.
[00:52:57.272 --> 00:53:03.773]  And so I did get a threatening phone call saying, you better not come to West Virginia talking about our beloved Birdman.
[00:53:04.713 --> 00:53:06.714]  But I don't like speaking ill of the dead.
[00:53:07.554 --> 00:53:10.835]  So I'm done talking about it, but I don't censor your calls.
[00:53:11.815 --> 00:53:14.616]  So the caller, who are we talking to?
[00:53:14.636 --> 00:53:17.596]  That's right, Scott in Washington.
[00:53:17.636 --> 00:53:18.456]  Scott, finish your point.
[00:53:18.476 --> 00:53:20.977]  We're talking about a Newsmax article about the Birdman.
[00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:32.477]  Well, one of the questions that was asked to him about his activities in the Klan today, and one of them that was asked was whether or not he participated in any lynchings.
[00:53:33.334 --> 00:53:33.894]  Back then.
[00:53:34.115 --> 00:53:36.516]  And that was the only question that was answered.
[00:53:36.556 --> 00:53:40.899]  The rest of them, the press secretary said that they never discussed it.
[00:53:40.939 --> 00:53:54.809]  But this particular one was asked and apparently Byrd told this press aide to tell the protesters is that he didn't recall whether or not he had actually participated in any lynchings.
[00:53:55.478 --> 00:54:03.367]  Now it seems to me that if you didn't do any of the things that you were accused of, you would come right out and say, no I didn't.
[00:54:03.867 --> 00:54:09.073]  And it was well known, and it was well known that in between the late 1880s and up until the mid-1980s,
[00:54:16.571 --> 00:54:29.316]  Now wait a minute, are you saying that a Grand Cyclopsian Supreme Dragon in one of the most oppressive states at the time, covered with Klan, where there were lynchings all over, might have been involved?
[00:54:29.356 --> 00:54:30.096]  That's ridiculous.
[00:54:30.657 --> 00:54:32.477]  That's like saying water might be wet.
[00:54:32.818 --> 00:54:36.119]  Don't talk bad about the Cyclops, the Cyclopsian ruler.
[00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:41.392]  That's what was quoted in there that he doesn't recall.
[00:54:41.632 --> 00:54:43.853]  That's the vague language that was used.
[00:54:44.613 --> 00:54:50.776]  So, you know, that's when I say, and I don't know for certain whether it's true, but that's why I say possible.
[00:54:50.856 --> 00:55:00.400]  So, you know, I don't like talking ill of the dead either, and I don't really like getting off into this stuff, but, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's no great loss, and
[00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:04.635]  You know, I hope he's burning in hell, but that's my take on it.
[00:55:04.675 --> 00:55:08.119]  So you're not crying yourself to sleep at night right now over a bird?
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.341]  Hell no.
[00:55:10.859 --> 00:55:12.319]  Okay, I appreciate your call, Scott.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.440]  Let me just say this.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.561]  Look, the Russians have infiltrated the United States.
[00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:20.682]  Of course they're trying to infiltrate computer companies and brokerage houses in Harvard.
[00:55:21.062 --> 00:55:24.003]  Because that's the corporate group that has hijacked our country.
[00:55:24.283 --> 00:55:27.624]  They're allowed to steal trillions of dollars in plain view and get in no trouble.
[00:55:27.864 --> 00:55:30.605]  Almost every person in the Obama administration is from Harvard.
[00:55:30.885 --> 00:55:32.826]  It's a sickening little crew of crooks.
[00:55:34.076 --> 00:55:35.918]  And I'm not saying you're bad if you have a Harvard degree.
[00:55:35.958 --> 00:55:36.979]  It is a great university.
[00:55:37.039 --> 00:55:42.345]  It's that in the political science area and the law school, it's a bunch of crooks.
[00:55:42.425 --> 00:55:43.506]  I mean, it's on record.
[00:55:43.546 --> 00:55:47.831]  I've had top PhDs from Harvard on who were taught how to overthrow America.
[00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.873]  It's a corporate takeover.
[00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:51.615]  You go, what's it have to do with Byrd?
[00:55:52.276 --> 00:55:53.077]  It's the same thing.
[00:55:53.157 --> 00:55:55.940]  Look, the Klan is almost non-existent in this country.
[00:55:57.423 --> 00:56:08.523]  Back when they had Birth of the Nation, you know, the machete of its time, it was the popular La Raza for white people, and it was popular, and the corporate media promoted it because there were millions and millions of members.
[00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:25.174]  But now it's a diversion and a distraction, and Byrd, as corrupt as he was, was in opposition to a lot of what was going on, because things are so much more corrupt now, they've surpassed anything he ever did.
[00:56:25.194 --> 00:56:29.895]  So it's kind of like, am I worried about 11 Russian sex operatives or whatever?
[00:56:32.506 --> 00:56:45.315]  Compared to global banks that have engaged in espionage, it's called globalism, who have bought off treacherous, treasonous Americans who've taken over our government and are robbing us and raising taxes to pay to themselves.
[00:56:45.636 --> 00:56:46.756]  That's what I'm focused on.
[00:56:47.377 --> 00:56:50.379]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:56.781 --> 00:57:01.643]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:57:01.763 --> 00:57:02.523]  What have we got?
[00:57:02.743 --> 00:57:04.844]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:57:05.184 --> 00:57:05.925]  A republic.
[00:57:06.185 --> 00:57:08.766]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:57:08.846 --> 00:57:10.746]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:57:11.107 --> 00:57:13.007]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:57:13.127 --> 00:57:14.408]  So they think they own our land?
[00:57:14.808 --> 00:57:15.928]  They think they own our water?
[00:57:16.129 --> 00:57:16.529]  Children?
[00:57:16.729 --> 00:57:17.509]  Our education?
[00:57:17.849 --> 00:57:18.469]  Our money?
[00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:22.331]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:57:22.711 --> 00:57:26.335]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:28.498]  We have the facts.
[00:57:28.698 --> 00:57:29.819]  We have the Constitution.
[00:57:29.859 --> 00:57:30.741]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:57:30.761 --> 00:57:31.602]  We have common law.
[00:57:31.662 --> 00:57:33.904]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:34.185 --> 00:57:37.949]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:57:38.049 --> 00:57:42.855]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:57:43.015 --> 00:57:44.397]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:57:44.517 --> 00:57:45.359]  Don't tread on me.
[00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:52.468]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:57:56.573 --> 00:58:00.795]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:01.115 --> 00:58:01.395]  Number 1.
[00:58:02.035 --> 00:58:05.176]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:05.456 --> 00:58:06.016]  Number 2.
[00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:10.878]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:11.198 --> 00:58:11.638]  It's true.
[00:58:11.938 --> 00:58:16.500]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:17.360]  Number 3.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.922]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:21.222 --> 00:58:24.923]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:25.143 --> 00:58:25.684]  Number 4.
[00:58:25.924 --> 00:58:28.286]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:28.687 --> 00:58:32.070]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:32.371 --> 00:58:32.591]  Number 5.
[00:58:33.171 --> 00:58:37.096]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:37.316 --> 00:58:42.081]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:58:42.361 --> 00:58:46.388]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:46.528 --> 00:58:48.090]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:50.394]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:58:56.957 --> 00:58:59.560]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:04.925]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:05.305 --> 00:59:07.027]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:07.347 --> 00:59:12.172]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:12.352 --> 00:59:13.313]  How much do you want?
[00:59:13.533 --> 00:59:14.274]  When do you want it?
[00:59:14.655 --> 00:59:16.256]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:16.536 --> 00:59:17.377]  When will you need it?
[00:59:17.618 --> 00:59:19.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:20.821]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:22.482]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:22.662 --> 00:59:27.744]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:27.944 --> 00:59:31.105]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:31.525 --> 00:59:35.027]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:35.347 --> 00:59:36.327]  How much will you need?
[00:59:36.567 --> 00:59:37.188]  We don't know.
[00:59:37.468 --> 00:59:38.388]  How much do you want?
[00:59:38.568 --> 00:59:39.289]  All you can get.
[00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.289]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:40.589 --> 00:59:43.352]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:43.652 --> 00:59:43.992]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:44.172 --> 00:59:46.755]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:46.775 --> 00:59:47.696]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:00:24.849 --> 01:00:25.910]  I don't like Al Gore.
[01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:27.813]  He's always like a big fat rapist to me.
[01:00:28.575 --> 01:00:30.217]  Looks like a giant pervert that I don't...
[01:00:31.297 --> 01:00:33.158]  Go off my instincts, though they're always right.
[01:00:33.178 --> 01:00:35.559]  I've got to trust but verify.
[01:00:35.579 --> 01:00:38.100]  And I've listened to the woman's testimony.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.201]  We played parts of it.
[01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:43.443]  It's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com since last weekend.
[01:00:44.283 --> 01:00:45.704]  And it's her audio police report.
[01:00:45.724 --> 01:00:46.965]  It's actually hours long.
[01:00:46.985 --> 01:00:50.746]  We put up a version that kind of boils it down to 23 minutes.
[01:00:52.027 --> 01:00:53.488]  But Al Gorb,
[01:00:54.687 --> 01:00:55.147]  Came in.
[01:00:55.628 --> 01:00:57.889]  He was staying at a fancy hotel.
[01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:00.692]  He showed her condoms and said, I'm going to use these.
[01:01:01.432 --> 01:01:04.314]  He began grabbing her hands and putting them on his genitals.
[01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:11.480]  She said she wasn't that type of masseuse, that she wasn't a prostitute, and that he seemed to be confused about what he'd ordered.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:30.437]  And she explained it all to him and then of course he started trying to get her stuff and leave and he was running up behind her in the bathrobe, hunching on her without underwear on and doing classic politician stuff of like, I'm not advancing on you when you don't want me to.
[01:01:30.657 --> 01:01:32.920]  That's preposterous as he was hunching on her.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.441]  I mean, that's classic.
[01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:38.364]  This is not an assault like at Waco as they're ramming the building, pumping gas in her.
[01:01:38.604 --> 01:01:40.025]  We're not setting up a world government.
[01:01:40.285 --> 01:01:42.006]  Next on CNN, world government.
[01:01:42.306 --> 01:01:44.368]  The only hope will pay our taxes to them.
[01:01:45.008 --> 01:01:54.515]  I'm not having unwanted sexual advances as he was chasing her around with an erection, protruding from his bathrobe, according to her.
[01:01:54.615 --> 01:01:55.916]  And it sounds very credible.
[01:01:57.417 --> 01:02:01.560]  And it's very credible that she didn't go file the report for a few months because she was so freaked out.
[01:02:03.527 --> 01:02:10.412]  I mean, I had a juvenile justice guard try to rape me in a shower, and I threatened him off of me, but I didn't talk about that for years.
[01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:15.055]  I'd probably been on talk radio for a decade before I'd talk about it, because it just sounds embarrassing.
[01:02:15.535 --> 01:02:16.476]  But now I can care less.
[01:02:16.516 --> 01:02:17.417]  I just talk about everything.
[01:02:18.217 --> 01:02:22.360]  But I mean, imagine a woman, Al Gore, who just won the Peace Prize.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.281]  He's like God.
[01:02:23.301 --> 01:02:31.547]  ABC News, Portland Police reopened Al Gore's sex abuse case, and she says she's got the blue stained dress.
[01:02:32.802 --> 01:02:39.706]  Oh, Al got a little too excited and we're not going to play, you know.
[01:02:39.946 --> 01:02:46.109]  Everybody's, if they've got a dog who hadn't castrated, you've seen it kind of get excited on the grass and scooting its hind end around.
[01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:47.310]  That's kind of what Al Gore did.
[01:02:49.608 --> 01:02:50.228]  Reportedly.
[01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:53.190]  So we'll see about this DNA testing.
[01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:54.571]  I shouldn't be laughing.
[01:02:54.591 --> 01:02:57.532]  I mean, it's a very serious matter to have a vice president involved in this.
[01:02:58.192 --> 01:02:59.433]  It's just, it's so gross.
[01:02:59.493 --> 01:03:03.495]  And Al Gore, the man-bear-pig, is so embarrassing and so degenerate.
[01:03:04.495 --> 01:03:06.717]  And this will discredit their global carbon tax.
[01:03:06.997 --> 01:03:16.301]  I mean, they've got their oil spill to push their carbon tax, and they're blocking the aid ships that could have skimmed all this up because they want the hurricanes to bring the oil in.
[01:03:17.822 --> 01:03:23.226]  Use the crisis to get their carbon tax and Al Gore, of course, is one of the main investors in it.
[01:03:24.047 --> 01:03:25.648]  But this is as big as the oil spill.
[01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.770]  They want to use some unrelated oil spill for taxes.
[01:03:29.411 --> 01:03:32.413]  This is going to put an even bigger nail in anthropogenic global warming.
[01:03:33.194 --> 01:03:36.056]  But see, there's a reason they're now reopening the investigation again.
[01:03:36.316 --> 01:03:38.558]  It's because he's not the Nobel Prize winner anymore.
[01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.659]  In the court of public opinion, he's a fraud.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.641]  He's lost all credibility.
[01:03:42.681 --> 01:03:43.842]  People know he's a joke.
[01:03:44.162 --> 01:03:45.163]  They remember Bill Clinton.
[01:03:46.946 --> 01:03:50.408]  Uh, saying, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[01:03:50.448 --> 01:03:55.891]  They remember all the women that came out who said that Bill Clinton would corner them, rape them, that he liked to bite them.
[01:03:55.911 --> 01:03:59.112]  He would bite them, bite their face to hold them down while he raped them.
[01:03:59.132 --> 01:04:05.416]  Uh, and people remember the interviews of the landlord of one lady, of Jennifer Flowers.
[01:04:05.736 --> 01:04:08.397]  The state police came and broke his legs and almost killed him.
[01:04:08.417 --> 01:04:13.340]  Uh, all because he'd videotaped Bill Clinton going in to have a little fun with his Jilly.
[01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:25.141]  And everybody remembers all those rape allegations and the groping allegations and that Clinton got caught lying about it and that he was groping and grabbing women and it seemed like the uglier the more.
[01:04:25.762 --> 01:04:27.423]  And that's actually something with the elite.
[01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:30.806]  They like down syndrome children and they like women who aren't that attractive.
[01:04:31.107 --> 01:04:32.888]  I mean, I wouldn't say this woman's that attractive.
[01:04:33.929 --> 01:04:37.192]  And it seems to be the forcing it on them.
[01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.684]  Some of the Harvard frat guys invented what they call whaling.
[01:04:43.845 --> 01:04:47.026]  I'm not going to go any deeper into it, but the fatter the woman, the better.
[01:04:47.046 --> 01:04:49.788]  And they like to get them drunk and then be mean to them.
[01:04:49.828 --> 01:04:51.809]  I've actually heard the story from some of the scum.
[01:04:52.969 --> 01:04:55.030]  So again, this is what these elites are into.
[01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:59.893]  If they can have any gorgeous, beautiful number 10 woman they want, now they like to kind of make an old lady
[01:05:00.513 --> 01:05:01.714]  I don't think so.
[01:05:15.788 --> 01:05:16.749]  He was just red-blooded.
[01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:19.672]  I'm not saying it's good what he did, but he did like attractive, fast women.
[01:05:20.213 --> 01:05:23.797]  There are worse crimes, but rape, or attempted rape, is a crime.
[01:05:24.117 --> 01:05:33.647]  Portland police reopened Al Gore's sex abuse allegations, and claimed former vice president subjected her to unwanted sexual touching in 2006.
[01:05:33.768 --> 01:05:36.390]  I love the way the media spins that.
[01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:37.552]  If you listen to this tape,
[01:05:38.479 --> 01:05:42.203]  If you listen to her police report, and you can hear the police, they're totally buying it.
[01:05:42.243 --> 01:05:43.624]  They totally know she's telling the truth.
[01:05:43.644 --> 01:05:45.946]  Because, I mean, that's what they're trained to be able to pick up on.
[01:05:45.966 --> 01:05:49.590]  In fact, let's just go ahead and play a few minutes of this tape right now.
[01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:54.094]  I'm only going to play a few minutes of it, but let's go ahead and play a few minutes of it.
[01:05:54.514 --> 01:05:57.777]  Again, Portland Police reopened Al Gore sex abuse tape.
[01:05:59.439 --> 01:06:03.303]  And the Chinese national television has also
[01:06:09.463 --> 01:06:12.266]  And of course, we also have the Inquirer cover.
[01:06:12.826 --> 01:06:15.509]  Al Gore is a pervert and sexual predator.
[01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:19.093]  And she told him, stop it, you sex poodle.
[01:06:20.434 --> 01:06:27.681]  She said she tried to nicely get him to stop, but he just kept pushing and pushing, and it appeared that's how he liked it, so she had to escape out of the room.
[01:06:28.482 --> 01:06:31.945]  But again, the reason I know her story's true, there's a lot of factors, was the
[01:06:33.083 --> 01:06:35.325]  You know, repeating, this is not unwanted sexual events!
[01:06:35.466 --> 01:06:36.347]  I am not making it!
[01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:37.788]  This is not happening!
[01:06:37.888 --> 01:06:46.478]  As he was chasing her around, trying to grab her from behind, hunching like a feral dog, you know, does with a chew toy.
[01:06:47.819 --> 01:06:49.040]  Let's go ahead and go to this tape.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:49.461]  Here it is.
[01:06:49.981 --> 01:06:54.947]  I went into much deeper shock as I realized it appeared he was demanding sexual favors.
[01:06:56.357 --> 01:06:57.418]  Or sexual behaviors.
[01:06:57.658 --> 01:07:04.123]  I decided to clarify... I got so freaked, I just got... I got a tiny bit mad under my terror.
[01:07:04.603 --> 01:07:14.431]  I decided to clarify things by asking him, as he angrily complained that I was not doing what he wanted, for him to show me exactly what he wanted me to do.
[01:07:14.871 --> 01:07:15.692]  Such is where I'm such.
[01:07:15.772 --> 01:07:16.913]  I said, well, why don't you show me?
[01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:19.555]  Because I thought, this is too nuts.
[01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:38.752]  He grabbed my right hand hard, shoved it down under the sheet to his pubic hair area, my fingers brushing against his penis, and firmly planted my hand on his pubic crest region and said to me, there, in a very sharp, loud, angry-sounding tone,
[01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.780]  This is all happening really fast, as you can imagine.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:08:02.557]  Furthered yet into shock from both his demand and his angry, intimidating behavior, I subtly and slowly slid my hand up away from the area and told him it would be a counterproductive massage technique, as he had said that he'd want it to unwind from stress and relax, and that it would get him to awake, I said euphemistically and diplomatically.
[01:08:02.577 --> 01:08:05.019]  I felt like I was dancing on the edge of a razor.
[01:08:06.886 --> 01:08:10.422]  He angrily raged an accusatory and threatening confrontational tone.
[01:08:10.623 --> 01:08:11.628]  He bellowed at me.
[01:08:14.189 --> 01:08:14.769]  I have no idea.
[01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:16.470]  And I've never had a client yell at me.
[01:08:16.851 --> 01:08:18.932]  Except for one who was brain injured and she was drunk.
[01:08:19.012 --> 01:08:20.153]  I work with her all the time.
[01:08:20.173 --> 01:08:20.813]  She's a mess.
[01:08:21.594 --> 01:08:24.435]  She's like five feet tall.
[01:08:24.455 --> 01:08:25.716]  And she'll cry.
[01:08:26.857 --> 01:08:27.497]  Okay, so.
[01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:30.139]  He screamed at me.
[01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:33.101]  He goes, I'm not asking... Imagine yelling.
[01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:35.963]  I'm not asking for you to do anything inappropriate.
[01:08:36.523 --> 01:08:39.645]  To which I replied in a softer, terrified, calming tone.
[01:08:40.005 --> 01:08:42.487]  No impropriety was inferred, sir.
[01:08:44.136 --> 01:08:53.141]  At this point I was realizing just how crazy and insidious he was and how precarious my situation was when he said the aforementioned even though he clearly wanted inappropriate touch.
[01:08:54.202 --> 01:08:55.662]  It's like, to make your mind go nuts.
[01:08:56.943 --> 01:09:00.305]  He was moaning, groaning, moving, and acting in a very suggestive way.
[01:09:00.385 --> 01:09:01.085]  It was unreal.
[01:09:01.206 --> 01:09:07.049]  I never even had any of my hotel clients get angry, yell, or act out at me before.
[01:09:07.879 --> 01:09:32.695]  During the massage episode I realized much to my horror that I was in the perfect storm and that I was in a room with someone who was Teflon coated in terms of his credibility and celebrity status and my usual safety net idea in all hotel massages before this of being able to escape from such a potential situation of perverted or threatening behavior from a client which would be terminate the massage and leave the room immediately for help from the
[01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:41.899]  The front hotel desk, even running and or shouting for help in the hallway if deemed necessary, was completely worthless in this situation.
[01:09:42.019 --> 01:09:57.004]  It was no longer viable because I feared that if I ran for the door to get out, I could or would be violently accosted by some security detail for seeming to be hostile, inappropriate, insubordinate, or threatening to him.
[01:09:57.524 --> 01:10:01.185]  And I feared being tased or shot by them as a first and immediate response.
[01:10:03.226 --> 01:10:14.594]  I also feared that if I made dissent with Gore, I could be in danger of being falsely arrested for false allegations of alleged soliciting or even attempted assault in his efforts to do damage control.
[01:10:14.734 --> 01:10:26.143]  And I felt certain that any, even the smallest, complaint from him to the hotel could also destroy my work-life reputation in all the hotels, and hence do irreparable damage to my livelihood.
[01:10:26.563 --> 01:10:32.207]  Not to mention damage my personal reputation, which I had spent years building with my livelihood.
[01:10:32.933 --> 01:10:38.316]  I felt very uncertain if I'd be able to get out of the room without being accosted by him anyway at this point.
[01:10:38.336 --> 01:10:41.117]  Does that all make sense to y'all?
[01:10:42.478 --> 01:10:52.603]  He then tried another tactic as though he had very suddenly switched personalities and began in a pleading tone, pleading for release of his second chakra there.
[01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:54.644]  There's so much tension being held.
[01:10:55.385 --> 01:11:01.728]  This was yet another euphemism for sexual activity he was requesting, but cleverly as though it were a spiritual request or something.
[01:11:02.528 --> 01:11:19.296]  I was further deeply shocked and repulsed as my realization of what was happening sunk in, and especially as my mind was now reeling from this absolute betrayal by someone I had inherently trusted as a good guy who cares about people, including me, because of his public persona.
[01:11:20.837 --> 01:11:24.719]  When I came out, he was in his robe and he complimented me on the session.
[01:11:25.695 --> 01:11:30.297]  I felt I could leave without further problems from him but I was wrong in that surmising.
[01:11:30.477 --> 01:11:38.520]  I was freaked out and trying to act calm and collected so as not to look vulnerable and so as to keep any other weirdness from him from happening.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:49.124]  He engaged me in small talk as I headed for my massage table to break it down and he came over to where I was while I was trying to pack up.
[01:11:50.325 --> 01:12:00.059]  And then he wrapped me in an inescapable embrace as I turned around, giving this come-heather look deep into my eyes and caressed my back and bicep press.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:04.586]  I squirmed to try and get out of his grasp, telling him to stop down several times and I
[01:12:05.507 --> 01:12:12.211]  I finally told him instead of being a crazed sex poodle, hoping that he'd realize how weird he was being, yet he persisted.
[01:12:12.592 --> 01:12:16.314]  He was much stronger than me, bigger than me, and insistent.
[01:12:16.414 --> 01:12:18.175]  It was completely unnerving.
[01:12:18.756 --> 01:12:22.978]  And I realized that resistance was making him giggle and pursue more strongly.
[01:12:23.679 --> 01:12:30.003]  And I knew then that this, resistance, was a dangerous tactic to use if I wanted to avoid being raped.
[01:12:30.971 --> 01:12:39.859]  I had the fear that rape would be inevitable if I could not get out of the room, yet I could see no way to immediately leave without it also being a risk to my safety.
[01:12:39.919 --> 01:12:40.300]  Okay.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.924]  Because I felt he would use force to counteract... It goes on forever, but we've got the full...
[01:12:47.106 --> 01:12:49.009]  We've got a 23 minute boil down.
[01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:54.535]  You can go hear this for yourself as he begins chasing her around with an erection.
[01:12:54.555 --> 01:13:01.403]  We don't normally talk about stuff like this on the show but we've got cops reportedly raping women up at the G20.
[01:13:02.915 --> 01:13:07.856]  We've got the Vice President, the former Vice President reportedly doing this, and it fits his M.O.
[01:13:08.276 --> 01:13:11.918]  to a T. You've got a new police investigation, so we have to play part of it.
[01:13:12.318 --> 01:13:13.378]  It gets too graphic.
[01:13:13.438 --> 01:13:28.842]  I've made the decision not to play anymore of the video because he starts running around with an erection outside of his robe, humping on her as she goes out the door, showing her condoms, saying, why are there condoms in this hotel room?
[01:13:29.142 --> 01:13:31.303]  This is a hotel room that supplies me this.
[01:13:33.427 --> 01:13:39.095]  And I was on a road trip once and I remember we were like in Nevada somewhere in the middle of nowhere on a college road trip.
[01:13:41.198 --> 01:13:44.362]  And we were sitting around joking in the room drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.
[01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:48.908]  And we're like, why does it say push here for massage?
[01:13:50.376 --> 01:13:54.018]  And one of the guys jokes and goes, this is Nevada, they probably send a whore to your room.
[01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:55.619]  And later I found out that's what that is.
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:01.323]  And so I think Al Gore must check into these super ritzy places and thought he was conked.
[01:14:01.963 --> 01:14:04.785]  Because later in the tape he goes, this is Oriental Massage!
[01:14:05.705 --> 01:14:16.412]  And I, you know, in downtown Austin they got places like Midnight Cowboy, or, and, you know, Oriental Massage, and, or now they're called Lingerie Modeling.
[01:14:16.432 --> 01:14:19.714]  And I've never been in one, but the word is you get a little
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.901]  Well, actually, I probably get four or five massages a year.
[01:14:26.901 --> 01:14:34.503]  And a couple times, and I didn't know what it meant, women giving me massages, and I don't like a man touching me, they would ask, have you ever heard of a happy ending?
[01:14:35.683 --> 01:14:37.003]  And I was like, no.
[01:14:37.363 --> 01:14:41.984]  And one time the lady just laughed, and the next time she described it, and it was like a hint.
[01:14:42.664 --> 01:14:44.165]  Do you want a happy ending, buddy?
[01:14:45.922 --> 01:14:49.524]  And I'm sorry, I am not into prostitutes.
[01:14:49.764 --> 01:14:57.347]  Number one, I'm married and like my wife, love my wife, but there's just something... Like, I'm not licking toilet bowls.
[01:14:57.387 --> 01:15:01.228]  I'm not licking... Oh, what do you call it?
[01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:04.890]  Doorknobs.
[01:15:06.571 --> 01:15:09.192]  And I'm not even looking down on those women or saying they're bad.
[01:15:09.292 --> 01:15:10.132]  I'm just scared.
[01:15:11.753 --> 01:15:13.874]  I'm, you know, I'm... But side issue.
[01:15:15.157 --> 01:15:31.564]  If you put all the pieces together, it's very, very, very clear that Al Gore thought he was ordering a oriental massage, as the code word is, and that she showed up and he was like, look, did you get to work, woman?
[01:15:31.584 --> 01:15:33.424]  I've had a long day.
[01:15:33.484 --> 01:15:34.365]  I'm very stressed.
[01:15:35.305 --> 01:15:40.027]  But the minute she said no, I mean, this was then sexual assault.
[01:15:42.785 --> 01:15:44.006]  And he molested this lady.
[01:15:44.766 --> 01:15:45.506]  And I believe it.
[01:15:45.786 --> 01:15:49.688]  And look, Inquirer, people confuse Inquirer of News of the World.
[01:15:49.708 --> 01:15:54.490]  Because you'll have the Inquirer and it'll say, government plans to microchip population.
[01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:58.111]  They'll have a real article that I've already seen in the AP a year before.
[01:15:58.331 --> 01:15:59.872]  They'll just give it a more shocking headline.
[01:16:00.412 --> 01:16:03.894]  And pretty much everything in the Inquirer, I mean I remember reading in the Inquirer
[01:16:05.011 --> 01:16:08.594]  When I was a little kid, it was like laying in a haircutting place.
[01:16:08.634 --> 01:16:09.275]  I mean, I don't remember.
[01:16:09.295 --> 01:16:11.477]  It was somewhere laying around in a business while I was waiting.
[01:16:11.957 --> 01:16:20.265]  And it said, Schwarzenegger's dad was a Nazi and Schwarzenegger dressed as a Nazi and gave out records of Hitler when he lived in California and would scream down with the blacks.
[01:16:20.825 --> 01:16:25.768]  At the weightlifting gym and said he wanted to be a dictator and all this stuff.
[01:16:25.868 --> 01:16:29.751]  And I thought, oh, this is the Inquirer when I was like 13 years old reading that.
[01:16:30.191 --> 01:16:33.673]  And then later it all came out in mainstream news and it turned out it was true.
[01:16:33.693 --> 01:16:34.914]  It's kind of like John Edwards.
[01:16:34.974 --> 01:16:36.515]  It was the Inquirer that broke all that.
[01:16:36.535 --> 01:16:39.957]  So you'll have the Inquirer that I think is a pretty good investigative journal.
[01:16:40.598 --> 01:16:44.801]  They do give it tabloid type sensational headlines, but this is sensational.
[01:16:45.563 --> 01:16:52.489]  But next to it'll have Bat Boy Lands on White House Lawn or President Meets with Aliens.
[01:16:53.289 --> 01:16:59.614]  And even those publications that are 90% bull, then they'll mix real news in to discredit it, I think.
[01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:02.957]  But I think the National Enquirer is a completely different animal.
[01:17:02.997 --> 01:17:04.658]  I mean, you know, here it is.
[01:17:04.679 --> 01:17:08.822]  Al Gore is a sexual pervert and predator.
[01:17:11.047 --> 01:17:13.828]  So, that is now in the news.
[01:17:13.848 --> 01:17:20.911]  All right, I'm going to come back, go to Frank, Brian, Lauren, Jim, Brian, and others on the other side of this quick break.
[01:17:20.951 --> 01:17:21.731]  We'll continue with calls.
[01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:25.433]  Ron Paul's scheduled to come up in about 40 minutes from now.
[01:17:26.193 --> 01:17:28.874]  And I know I didn't get to your Twitter questions for Jesse Ventura.
[01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:29.635]  I only got to two of them.
[01:17:30.635 --> 01:17:35.639]  But if you've got Twitter questions, there's a good chance I'll end up asking them of Congressman Paul.
[01:17:36.019 --> 01:17:38.781]  So it's Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.103]  Get those tweets into me right now.
[01:17:41.163 --> 01:17:46.547]  Your questions for Congressman Ron Paul at Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[01:17:47.047 --> 01:17:48.228]  And that is coming up.
[01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:49.549]  But we'll continue with your phone calls.
[01:17:49.569 --> 01:17:54.333]  And I'm going to get into the Gulf, more on the Russian spies, the economy, and a lot more.
[01:17:54.593 --> 01:17:56.054]  PresidentPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:17:57.335 --> 01:17:59.415]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:17:59.856 --> 01:18:02.956]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:18:03.416 --> 01:18:11.398]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:18:11.898 --> 01:18:16.820]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:22.481]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:18:23.021 --> 01:18:30.549]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food, too.
[01:18:31.049 --> 01:18:36.055]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:18:36.515 --> 01:18:37.716]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:18:38.317 --> 01:18:43.780]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.842]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[01:18:47.142 --> 01:18:50.604]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[01:18:50.644 --> 01:18:52.806]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[01:18:57.208 --> 01:18:59.510]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:01.812]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:19:01.912 --> 01:19:04.734]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:19:05.114 --> 01:19:09.858]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:19:10.239 --> 01:19:14.422]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:19:14.742 --> 01:19:17.065]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:19.609]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:22.552]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:19:22.873 --> 01:19:30.483]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:19:30.823 --> 01:19:36.065]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:38.486]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:19:38.526 --> 01:19:42.487]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:19:42.747 --> 01:19:43.668]  And I got news for you.
[01:19:43.828 --> 01:19:45.108]  You're everyone else.
[01:19:45.168 --> 01:19:46.229]  Invisible Empire.

[01:19:57.205 --> 01:20:00.426]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:20:00.946 --> 01:20:01.527]  Think again.
[01:20:02.267 --> 01:20:09.769]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:16.912]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:20:17.152 --> 01:20:22.534]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:25.396]  On how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.
[01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:26.617]  Do what NOAA did.
[01:20:26.817 --> 01:20:31.140]  Contact airfiltersandpurifiers.com and ask about the Health Mate Plus.

[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:36.423]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we have the best, most hard-hitting documentary books, films, Patriot t-shirts, materials to wake folks up.
[01:21:36.443 --> 01:21:42.504]  And that's why the government is moving to shut off the Internet, to shut down free speech, to shut down Campaign for Liberty with Ron Paul.
[01:21:42.945 --> 01:21:46.726]  They don't want Ron Paul to be able to tell you how someone voted in America.
[01:21:46.786 --> 01:21:50.267]  That's in the FEC, Federal Elections Commission investigation.
[01:21:51.263 --> 01:22:02.111]  I mean, that's how much trouble we're in, but also that shows how effective we are, that the establishment wouldn't be trying to shut us down if it wasn't having an effect on them.
[01:22:02.171 --> 01:22:09.156]  So get the videos, Endgame, Invisible Empire, The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, the t-shirts.
[01:22:10.297 --> 01:22:13.539]  Get them all, wear them, hand them out, put them on AXS TV.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.202]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:22:16.222 --> 01:22:17.082]  Fifteen cents a day.

[01:22:20.005 --> 01:22:20.705]  Burn them to disk.
[01:22:21.166 --> 01:22:22.547]  Give them to everyone you know.
[01:22:23.407 --> 01:22:24.949]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:25.289 --> 01:22:29.653]  We also now have two online video bookstore shopping carts available.
[01:22:29.693 --> 01:22:33.536]  We have the Yahoo cart and we've launched a new cart of our own.
[01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:37.239]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:22:37.259 --> 01:22:38.340]  I love the two new t-shirts.
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:39.741]  We've got five new t-shirts total, but
[01:22:43.704 --> 01:22:49.336]  The two new ones that have an American flag with barbed wire across it making up the stripes and it says legalize freedom.
[01:22:49.857 --> 01:22:52.382]  Infowars.com says the same thing on the back.
[01:22:52.503 --> 01:22:54.206]  And another that shows Uncle Sam as...
[01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:57.130]  A POW MIA.
[01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:02.594]  We've got an In The Fed shirt and a bunch of new great shirts at Infowars.com.
[01:23:02.814 --> 01:23:13.041]  And they're all meant to get conversations going with people and so you can meet like-minded people when you go to a tea party or when you're on the street or when you're at church or when you're at work.
[01:23:13.401 --> 01:23:17.624]  LegalizeFreedom, Infowars.com, Uncle Sam behind the POW wire.
[01:23:17.904 --> 01:23:22.708]  And you can explain that to people that America has been taken over by a hostile offshore corporate takeover.
[01:23:23.328 --> 01:23:25.830]  And we're in the final phases of our republic being destroyed.
[01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:27.832]  Let's go to Frank in North Carolina.
[01:23:27.872 --> 01:23:28.473]  Frank, you're on the air.
[01:23:28.533 --> 01:23:29.073]  Thanks for holding.
[01:23:30.194 --> 01:23:31.495]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:23:31.515 --> 01:23:34.698]  You've got a reformed Imperial Stormtrooper on the phone here.
[01:23:35.679 --> 01:23:37.200]  Well, good to have you join the rebellion.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:37.641]  Go ahead.
[01:23:37.661 --> 01:23:41.104]  Yeah, I'm in corrupt North Carolina here.
[01:23:42.065 --> 01:23:43.025]  I was just thinking...
[01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:45.652]  About with regards to Al Gore.
[01:23:46.112 --> 01:23:50.294]  Perhaps the elites have decided to sacrifice him to Moloch.
[01:23:50.754 --> 01:23:58.678]  Maybe they've given the green light on that because, you know, their little plan, their little agenda didn't go so well with the cap and trade.
[01:23:58.738 --> 01:24:01.679]  Well, let me stop you and I'll hold you over because I want to be able to finish your point.
[01:24:02.816 --> 01:24:04.837]  But great minds think alike.
[01:24:05.617 --> 01:24:13.580]  And I remember Lord Monckton, not in this interview, but in the last interview, saying he believes they will throw people under the bus.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.141]  I said, how do you think they're going to counter us?
[01:24:15.881 --> 01:24:19.302]  And he and others said, well, normally they'll have a sacrifice.
[01:24:19.322 --> 01:24:21.243]  They will destroy someone.
[01:24:21.503 --> 01:24:26.205]  He said, I don't think it'll just stop with Professor Jones, one of the ringleaders of the university fraud.
[01:24:26.245 --> 01:24:26.505]  It may
[01:24:27.225 --> 01:24:29.206]  You know, expand from there to even Al Gore.
[01:24:29.526 --> 01:24:34.747]  And then Jaren, during the break, right before I went to you, said, Alex, don't you think they're throwing him under the bus?
[01:24:34.827 --> 01:24:36.327]  Use the same term you used.
[01:24:36.868 --> 01:24:38.368]  Aren't they throwing him under the bus?
[01:24:39.148 --> 01:24:41.129]  And they'll get a new puppet for Cap and Trade.
[01:24:42.009 --> 01:24:44.390]  And I said, yeah, I'm going to make that point when I go live.
[01:24:44.670 --> 01:24:47.170]  Then I go to you and you say the same thing, Frank.
[01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:52.432]  So, yes, I think, I mean, they knew about this the whole time, but also he's now been discredited.
[01:24:52.852 --> 01:24:53.192]  And so,
[01:24:53.812 --> 01:25:01.656]  I think the police were scared to go after him to begin with, and I think the system now may let him be destroyed because it's a convenient distraction.
[01:25:02.337 --> 01:25:10.981]  But I'm sorry, he just looks like a rapist, and I don't normally go off how somebody looks, but he looks like a pervert to me, but you can't go off that.
[01:25:11.261 --> 01:25:15.504]  This woman says she has DNA from him hunching on her, that he ejaculated on her.
[01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.065]  She says she's got witnesses as well.
[01:25:18.125 --> 01:25:19.265]  Stay there, we'll come back to you.
[01:25:19.805 --> 01:25:25.787]  One minute break, we'll get Frank, who says he's a retired or reformed Storm Trooper, maybe current or former police officer.
[01:25:26.188 --> 01:25:29.229]  Then we'll go to Brian, Lauren, Jim and Brian.
[01:25:29.469 --> 01:25:32.150]  But again, you're not really a rebellion against the Empire.
[01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:35.751]  The Empire overthrew the Republic, so you want the old Republic back.
[01:25:38.912 --> 01:25:40.973]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:26:52.115 --> 01:26:54.880]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:06.548 --> 01:27:09.393]  Al Gore is a pervert and sexual predator.
[01:27:09.473 --> 01:27:15.502]  ABC News headline, Portland Police reopen Al Gore sex abuse allegations.
[01:27:16.103 --> 01:27:21.491]  Look, I don't think the police want to bust Al Gore because they know they'll be punished, they'll be persecuted later.
[01:27:22.472 --> 01:27:30.675]  But because this has come out, his wife's leaving him, he's been exposed as a fraud for Climategate, set to make billions of dollars off this fraud himself individually.
[01:27:31.616 --> 01:27:36.477]  This is coming back to the fore now, because Al Gore is seen as weaker.
[01:27:36.898 --> 01:27:42.320]  But if the police really wanted to burn him, they'd be having press conferences, they'd be saying they thought he was guilty.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.261]  Uh, who knows what's really going on here, but this fits Al Gore.
[01:27:47.281 --> 01:27:52.342]  And I don't think this woman's sophisticated enough to actually know what an Al Gore would say.
[01:27:52.382 --> 01:27:58.823]  I mean, the way she describes him as he's trying to, you know, grab her and hump on her, for lack of a better word, you know, hunching on her.
[01:27:59.303 --> 01:28:00.804]  I'm not doing it unwanted.
[01:28:00.844 --> 01:28:01.824]  This is not happening.
[01:28:02.424 --> 01:28:04.324]  I'm angry with you saying I'm doing this.
[01:28:04.364 --> 01:28:07.105]  That is exactly what these guys do.
[01:28:07.225 --> 01:28:08.805]  That is exactly what they're all about.
[01:28:09.085 --> 01:28:11.466]  They assault you and deny they're doing it.
[01:28:11.506 --> 01:28:12.706]  But go ahead and make your point, sir.
[01:28:15.437 --> 01:28:21.864]  Yes, as far as the reformed Imperial Stormtrooper thing, I was referring to my days as a Marine.
[01:28:23.746 --> 01:28:31.073]  I've since woke up from that take on General Smedley Butler's view on the world and gangsterism and all that.
[01:28:33.564 --> 01:28:35.586]  Well, you couldn't find a better role model for a Marine.
[01:28:35.606 --> 01:28:37.248]  He's the most highly decorated Marine in U.S.
[01:28:37.268 --> 01:28:37.589]  history.
[01:28:37.969 --> 01:28:38.770]  That's pretty hard order.
[01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:42.234]  Yeah, he's a two-time recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[01:28:42.254 --> 01:28:45.978]  Hey, I caught Jerry Brownfield yesterday.
[01:28:46.018 --> 01:28:47.280]  I heard the end of his show.
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:52.646]  I don't normally listen to his show, but he had a guest on there talking about a book that was written like a hundred years ago called The Coming Battle.
[01:28:53.624 --> 01:29:08.614]  Yes, we've sold that book in the past, we don't anymore, but it was written in 1898 about how the private banks were going to take over America, and how this wasn't a foreign government taking over, it was a new type of threat, a corporate takeover, kind of like the British East India Company took over China.
[01:29:09.835 --> 01:29:10.756]  Yeah, it was fascinating.
[01:29:10.816 --> 01:29:12.737]  I thought I'd heard you speak on it years ago.
[01:29:12.797 --> 01:29:14.498]  By the way, you did wake me up back in 2005.
[01:29:14.859 --> 01:29:19.962]  Can I give a quick review on a product?
[01:29:20.543 --> 01:29:21.003]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:23.321]  I got it within 6 days.
[01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:46.061]  It's called a SAW M249 style grip.
[01:29:46.321 --> 01:29:53.908]  It's like the grips we used on our M249 light machine guns in the Marines, but it is perfect for the AK-47 setup.
[01:29:54.970 --> 01:29:57.072]  What is it like a little bar that sticks out on the bottom?
[01:29:57.833 --> 01:30:04.139]  No, this is the actual primary pistol grips seated behind the trigger guard.
[01:30:04.379 --> 01:30:09.664]  It's a lot larger and it allows you to have a lot more control of the weapon.
[01:30:09.724 --> 01:30:10.965]  It's very ergonomical.
[01:30:11.025 --> 01:30:13.007]  It's just very, very good.
[01:30:14.329 --> 01:30:15.470]  So you like the 7.6239 type rifles?
[01:30:18.373 --> 01:30:21.156]  Yeah, I got rid of my ARs years ago.
[01:30:21.216 --> 01:30:25.440]  I bought into all the propaganda about the 7.62x39mm.
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.942]  I think it's good for busting things up.
[01:30:28.903 --> 01:30:30.484]  Oh, it certainly is up close.
[01:30:30.544 --> 01:30:35.329]  I mean, if you want something that isn't going to fail on you, and it's guaranteed, there's nothing like the Kalashnikov, is there?
[01:30:36.542 --> 01:30:38.283]  No, mine's all black.
[01:30:39.224 --> 01:30:42.686]  But this saw grip has turned it into a completely different weapon.
[01:30:42.726 --> 01:30:44.607]  I mean, it's just such an awesome feel.
[01:30:45.107 --> 01:30:49.070]  Is that the one that has the big giant hole in the butt?
[01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:50.290]  Yes, it is.
[01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:52.872]  Yeah, I've got a Bulgarian one with a handle like that.
[01:30:53.973 --> 01:30:54.693]  Very interesting.
[01:30:54.713 --> 01:30:55.313]  It's just like the M249 saw.
[01:30:56.764 --> 01:30:57.145]  Okay.
[01:30:57.545 --> 01:31:00.870]  I'm not really familiar with that, but I'm only familiar with the rifles I've got.
[01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:02.552]  I'll tell you what's a good gun.
[01:31:03.513 --> 01:31:08.520]  There's a whole lot of great European .308s out there as well.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.182]  Hey, listen, thanks for calling in.
[01:31:10.202 --> 01:31:10.923]  Good to hear from you.
[01:31:11.764 --> 01:31:17.966]  Alright, we're going to come back from break and we're going to go to Brian, Lauren, Jim, Brian and others.
[01:31:17.986 --> 01:31:24.829]  I'm going to try to get through those calls at least and then get to some more news on the hurricane coming in, the oil.
[01:31:24.849 --> 01:31:31.851]  I kind of want to recap what's going on because all the time I hear a rebroadcast of my show or I'm on somebody else's show.
[01:31:33.252 --> 01:31:35.393]  I was on Man Cal's show for about 40 minutes this morning.
[01:31:36.601 --> 01:31:42.347]  He was playing news clips where they were admitting that BP created cap-and-trade with Ken Lay and Enron.
[01:31:43.308 --> 01:31:55.039]  And I've talked about that some, but it was just coming home to me how incredible that is, and the fact that BP is the third biggest bankroller of Obama, and the media is acting like he's against BP.
[01:31:58.462 --> 01:32:02.083]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:02.423 --> 01:32:10.544]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:11.264 --> 01:32:15.305]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:26.727]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:27.347 --> 01:32:36.349]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:36.869 --> 01:32:41.930]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:42.291 --> 01:32:49.472]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:49.772 --> 01:32:52.533]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:56.405 --> 01:33:00.407]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.
[01:33:00.867 --> 01:33:07.770]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute into a concise, readily accessible form.
[01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:11.792]  By tracking 300 separately defined domestic and international trends,
[01:33:12.392 --> 01:33:16.677]  The Trends Journal establishes the connections that others fail to see or misinterpret.
[01:33:16.918 --> 01:33:24.126]  Gerald Salente's Trends Journal allows you to anticipate change, recognize the implications, and take protective strategies.
[01:33:24.787 --> 01:33:29.493]  Individual readers from every walk of life can put the Trends Journal trends forecast
[01:33:29.833 --> 01:33:30.353]  We're good to go.
[01:33:56.138 --> 01:34:00.361]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:34:00.681 --> 01:34:01.282]  Number 1.
[01:34:01.602 --> 01:34:04.744]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:34:05.025 --> 01:34:05.585]  Number 2.
[01:34:05.885 --> 01:34:10.429]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:34:10.769 --> 01:34:11.229]  It's true.
[01:34:11.509 --> 01:34:16.073]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:34:16.393 --> 01:34:16.933]  Number 3.
[01:34:17.214 --> 01:34:20.496]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:34:20.796 --> 01:34:24.499]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:34:24.699 --> 01:34:25.259]  Number four.
[01:34:25.499 --> 01:34:27.860]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:31.641]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:34:31.941 --> 01:34:32.481]  Number five.
[01:34:32.721 --> 01:34:36.642]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:34:36.862 --> 01:34:41.644]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:34:41.924 --> 01:34:45.965]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:34:46.105 --> 01:34:47.666]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:34:47.886 --> 01:34:52.487]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:34:52.807 --> 01:34:53.047]  877-327-0365.
[01:34:53.067 --> 01:34:59.853]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:34:59.873 --> 01:35:03.255]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:16.626 --> 01:35:18.948]  We're gonna get Ron Paul's take on the oil spill.
[01:35:20.555 --> 01:35:28.539]  And on the Federal Elections Commission, witch hunt against him, and of course what's happening, the incredible developments in the economy.
[01:35:28.579 --> 01:35:44.687]  I mean, I cannot stress to you how serious it is to have CNN, the Associated Press, Reuters, everybody saying, oh, the UN says get rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency and have SDRs run by the IMF and World Bank.
[01:35:45.508 --> 01:35:46.929]  I mean, this is world government.
[01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:49.110]  This is total bondage by these crooks.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:36:04.072]  And simultaneously in Europe, in Greece, everywhere, they have engineered the collapse of these economies, on record, and then take the Financial Reform Act that just passed the House, now they've got to reconcile it with the Senate version.
[01:36:04.973 --> 01:36:15.722]  Even the Washington Post admitted, in an article last Friday, that it's $600 trillion that's owed to these bankers.
[01:36:17.236 --> 01:36:19.777]  It's owed because they just made up the money and claim we owe it.
[01:36:20.277 --> 01:36:20.697]  Literally.
[01:36:20.977 --> 01:36:21.618]  It's derivatives.
[01:36:21.658 --> 01:36:22.258]  It's made up.
[01:36:22.778 --> 01:36:24.679]  They're claiming we owe it because they're in control.
[01:36:25.319 --> 01:36:31.121]  And that this allows them to take over the entire industries, economic industries, in this country.
[01:36:31.341 --> 01:36:33.982]  The financial industry and anything that affects the economy.
[01:36:37.441 --> 01:36:38.722]  It's a financial dictatorship.
[01:36:38.762 --> 01:36:40.163]  It's giving the Federal Reserve more power.
[01:36:40.443 --> 01:36:45.507]  In fact, guys, I had that article from Friday highlighted, and I looked for it for like 30 minutes this morning.
[01:36:45.567 --> 01:36:46.888]  I can't find it in all my stacks.
[01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:56.015]  If you go search engine, I forget the exact name of the Washington Post article, but it was about the financial reform bill to pass Senate, I believe.
[01:36:56.455 --> 01:37:00.558]  But if you just Google financial reform bill, Washington Post, 600 trillion.
[01:37:02.304 --> 01:37:05.305]  Because $600 trillion was in the article, it'll come up.
[01:37:05.366 --> 01:37:07.747]  So just Washington Post, financial reform bill, $600 trillion.
[01:37:07.787 --> 01:37:11.529]  Because I want to have that and quote that to Ron Paul when he's on.
[01:37:11.869 --> 01:37:12.989]  Okay, let's hurry through your calls.
[01:37:13.269 --> 01:37:14.450]  Brian in North Carolina.
[01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:15.330]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:37:16.251 --> 01:37:16.591]  Hey!
[01:37:17.471 --> 01:37:27.937]  I was a victim of childhood vaccination, so I woken up when I went to your website, and that's when I started my website, USWGO Alternative News.
[01:37:27.997 --> 01:37:28.957]  I think you've seen it before.
[01:37:29.637 --> 01:37:30.598]  Okay, what's on your mind today?
[01:37:32.505 --> 01:37:34.126]  I wanted to talk a little bit.
[01:37:34.146 --> 01:37:36.008]  I'm going to try to be quick anyways.
[01:37:37.349 --> 01:37:42.412]  I heard about how the FEC is going after Ron Paul and I think it's awful.
[01:37:42.472 --> 01:37:43.853]  It's like Hitler style.
[01:37:44.354 --> 01:37:53.180]  Once they bring in all these snakes into the office and get rid of people like Ron Paul and Ren Paul, they'll have complete control of the Capitol.
[01:37:55.572 --> 01:38:20.023]  Exactly, and most of the snakes in government are CFR, Council on Foreign Relations, that openly writes they want a one world government, openly wants a North American Union, openly wants secret arrest of citizens, openly wants all this tyranny and all these new wars, openly wants weather modification, the CFR calls for that, openly wants cashless society, world government,
[01:38:21.414 --> 01:38:25.256]  And the government's just full of CFR, which is the Corporate Governance Body.
[01:38:25.716 --> 01:38:28.037]  It's full of all these Harvard people.
[01:38:28.097 --> 01:38:29.998]  It's full of all these Goldman Sachs people.
[01:38:30.418 --> 01:38:34.780]  This is a private corporate takeover of our country, and it's happening now.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.940]  I appreciate your call, Brian.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:37.701]  Lauren in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:38:39.707 --> 01:38:39.927]  Alex?
[01:38:40.488 --> 01:38:40.848]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:38:40.868 --> 01:38:41.288]  Can you hear me?
[01:38:41.769 --> 01:38:44.070]  Present Planet, uh, watching on Present Planet here.
[01:38:44.411 --> 01:38:46.532]  I just wanted to give you an update from the Twin Cities.
[01:38:46.792 --> 01:38:54.819]  Um, I'm a healthcare worker as well, but I'm not striking, but we have, uh, on Tuesday, 12,000 RNs getting ready to strike on Tuesday.
[01:38:54.879 --> 01:38:57.641]  I've got several dozens of videos, uh, getting ready to...
[01:38:58.181 --> 01:38:59.962]  Get out there on the strike lines and wake them up.
[01:39:00.042 --> 01:39:01.602]  I urge everyone else to do the same.
[01:39:03.183 --> 01:39:06.804]  Divide and conquer by the Obamacare.
[01:39:07.844 --> 01:39:19.508]  Also, Pioneer Press, June 28th, front page news, new documents reveal inspectors knew the bridge could collapse.
[01:39:19.568 --> 01:39:25.150]  And this is highly suspicious related to the NAFTA superhighway.
[01:39:25.170 --> 01:39:26.010]  Wanted to get your
[01:39:27.096 --> 01:39:28.498]  Comment on that, if any.
[01:39:28.758 --> 01:39:32.142]  And, uh, I know a friend in, uh, transportation.
[01:39:32.562 --> 01:39:34.845]  He just received... He's awake, too.
[01:39:35.265 --> 01:39:39.350]  He just received a first observer card from Homeland Security.
[01:39:39.650 --> 01:39:42.573]  iTalk reports suspicious activities.
[01:39:43.194 --> 01:39:44.675]  Call Homeland Security.
[01:39:45.496 --> 01:39:46.776]  Anyways, that's all I had Alex.
[01:39:46.956 --> 01:39:48.897]  I could get your comments, please.
[01:39:49.217 --> 01:39:53.118]  Well, that's part of InfraGard, of course, them all getting their little tattletale cards.
[01:39:53.138 --> 01:39:56.219]  And that would be fine if we didn't have a corrupt government that can't be trusted.
[01:39:56.239 --> 01:40:03.860]  And then of course they always start you out looking for Al-Qaeda, but the training then turns into look for gun owners, look for veterans, look for patriots.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:04.421]  They're evil.
[01:40:05.161 --> 01:40:08.182]  But your other question was dealing with what?
[01:40:08.282 --> 01:40:09.922]  I forget now answering the bridge part.
[01:40:11.247 --> 01:40:18.971]  Uh, June 28th, Pioneer Press, new documents reveal inspectors knew the bridge had potential to collapse.
[01:40:19.632 --> 01:40:35.601]  Well, I haven't seen that article, but we all remember the famous Minnesota bridge collapse that became such a big diversion, and then they used that to push for a North American Union, claiming that that would somehow fund new roads, as if more taxes paid to offshore groups would help our country.
[01:40:36.221 --> 01:40:38.663]  But I seem to remember seeing articles about
[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:39.640]  I'm
[01:40:56.275 --> 01:40:57.596]  In danger of collapsing.
[01:40:57.656 --> 01:41:20.052]  And so, for them to say that they had reports from the engineers that a bridge could collapse, there are engineers that are good men and women, who are part of highway departments nationwide, who constantly, it turned out, I'm going from memory on this, but filed reports saying, yes, this bridge is in danger, that bridge is in danger, all these bridges are in danger of collapsing, and then they just don't get repaired.
[01:41:20.372 --> 01:41:23.374]  I mean, our railways, when my grandmother,
[01:41:24.295 --> 01:41:25.115]  was going to college.
[01:41:47.168 --> 01:41:50.591]  The train would get there in less than an hour and get back in less than an hour.
[01:41:50.892 --> 01:41:51.612]  You're talking about 150 miles.
[01:41:51.632 --> 01:41:52.813]  The train went over 100 miles an hour.
[01:41:52.853 --> 01:41:53.614]  This was in the 50s.
[01:41:58.206 --> 01:42:04.092]  Those same rail beds now, you can't go on a train more than 50 miles an hour because they don't repair them.
[01:42:04.352 --> 01:42:06.254]  They don't fix the beds, they don't fix the rails.
[01:42:07.275 --> 01:42:08.276]  Our roads are the same.
[01:42:09.057 --> 01:42:11.939]  You can drive 150 miles an hour on German roads, not here.
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:17.044]  Because the money doesn't go to build the roads, it goes to line the pockets of the bankers.
[01:42:17.565 --> 01:42:19.146]  So yes, I have seen the reports.
[01:42:20.027 --> 01:42:28.170]  Uh, not just in Minnesota, I haven't seen that particular one, where they know bridges and trestles everywhere on the verge of collapsing, and they're collapsing all the time.
[01:42:28.530 --> 01:42:29.991]  So I appreciate your call, really good points.
[01:42:30.951 --> 01:42:33.112]  Uh, up next here is Jim in Illinois.
[01:42:33.172 --> 01:42:33.872]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:42:33.892 --> 01:42:35.753]  Hey, Alex.
[01:42:36.193 --> 01:42:36.513]  Hey, buddy.
[01:42:37.333 --> 01:42:43.356]  Hey, yeah, I just wanted to give you my, uh, Jim from Illinois checking in for this week.
[01:42:44.736 --> 01:42:46.757]  Um, we have a problem here in Illinois.
[01:42:47.837 --> 01:42:49.938]  about land acquisition.
[01:42:50.418 --> 01:43:03.102]  They're trying to take people's land by eminent domain for a new airport way before the FAA has even approved it.
[01:43:04.642 --> 01:43:05.022]  Okay?
[01:43:05.362 --> 01:43:11.444]  And they want to buy their land at 50% of what it was two years ago.
[01:43:11.464 --> 01:43:16.806]  I just wanted to check in with you with that and let you know about that.
[01:43:21.001 --> 01:43:23.042]  Well, it just sounds like there's corruption everywhere.
[01:43:24.463 --> 01:43:25.644]  Exactly, you know?
[01:43:26.205 --> 01:43:26.585]  You know?
[01:43:27.365 --> 01:43:28.566]  This is crazy, man.
[01:43:30.407 --> 01:43:32.109]  Well, okay, go ahead.
[01:43:33.029 --> 01:43:34.870]  I'm just saying, just checking in with you, Alex.
[01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:37.592]  You know, this doesn't even make any sense anymore.
[01:43:37.632 --> 01:43:39.313]  I'm a 51-year-old male.
[01:43:39.894 --> 01:43:41.955]  I don't understand anything anymore.
[01:43:41.975 --> 01:43:44.257]  This isn't the country I grew up in.
[01:43:44.637 --> 01:43:47.579]  This isn't the country I saw.
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.241]  I don't understand anything anymore.
[01:43:53.334 --> 01:43:54.155]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:43:54.175 --> 01:43:55.296]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:55.316 --> 01:43:56.858]  It's just getting worse and worse.
[01:43:57.779 --> 01:44:00.081]  We have people who don't care about the country and the future.
[01:44:00.121 --> 01:44:03.485]  They care about robbing and getting total power and control now.
[01:44:04.646 --> 01:44:06.448]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:44:06.749 --> 01:44:09.392]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Tennessee.
[01:44:09.812 --> 01:44:10.733]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:44:11.534 --> 01:44:11.954]  Hey, Alex.
[01:44:11.994 --> 01:44:12.515]  How's it going?
[01:44:12.835 --> 01:44:13.136]  Good, sir.
[01:44:14.546 --> 01:44:16.126]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:44:16.486 --> 01:44:18.127]  There's a couple things I want to talk to you about.
[01:44:19.527 --> 01:44:22.828]  Your phrase, corporate takeover, is very adequate.
[01:44:24.268 --> 01:44:27.009]  I did want to ask you a question, something that I heard.
[01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:32.610]  Someone I don't agree with on everything, but I do believe he is correct on a few things.
[01:44:33.010 --> 01:44:43.972]  David Icke said that the Virginia company still owns this quote-unquote country, but they just simply changed their name to the United States.
[01:44:44.617 --> 01:44:47.800]  He wrote that in one of his books, A Guide to the Global Conspiracy.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:48.240]  It's on page 231.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:48.921]  Is that true?
[01:44:48.941 --> 01:44:49.662]  Say that again?
[01:44:53.976 --> 01:45:21.543]  He said that the British Crown that owns the Virginia Company simply changed their name under several pseudonyms, as he says, as U.S., U.S.A., United States of America, Washington, D.C., District of Columbia, etc., and that this country is technically still being run by the Crown.
[01:45:25.336 --> 01:45:32.198]  There's some truth to that, but people also say the United States is a corporation chartered in Delaware, and that's not actually true.
[01:45:32.218 --> 01:45:41.601]  It's a little more sophisticated than that, but deals were made with the British Crown as part of the armistice, and in the end of the war,
[01:45:42.341 --> 01:45:48.066]  Where we did sign treaties with England and some of the holdings of British corporations they were allowed to keep.
[01:45:48.147 --> 01:45:49.768]  Most of them they weren't.
[01:45:49.788 --> 01:45:58.496]  But there's no doubt the District of Columbia is now operating as an outside force and it itself has been part of a corporate takeover since 1933.
[01:45:58.596 --> 01:46:07.144]  It was taken over by the Bank of England at that time and the Council on Foreign Relations was established by British intelligence.
[01:46:08.085 --> 01:46:11.348]  So, yes, globalism is just the British Empire by stealth.
[01:46:11.748 --> 01:46:14.851]  Globalization is treason by its very definition.
[01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:19.114]  Meanwhile, they've got us all scared to death of men with turbans or 11 Russian spies.
[01:46:19.494 --> 01:46:22.396]  And, you know, all of that is going on and is, I guess, a threat at some level.
[01:46:23.017 --> 01:46:27.080]  But it's the difference between being shot with a BB gun and being dropped into a meat grinder.
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:30.703]  I mean, just the orders of a degree.
[01:46:30.763 --> 01:46:35.707]  It is the British mercantile imperial model that is literally raping and robbing everything.
[01:46:36.544 --> 01:46:37.004]  Exactly.
[01:46:37.244 --> 01:46:46.067]  And another question that I have is that, you know, we have a military that can defend us from foreign invaders, just like most countries have a military.
[01:46:48.428 --> 01:46:49.588]  That's pretty straightforward.
[01:46:50.128 --> 01:46:53.309]  How do you fight a monster like this?
[01:46:53.809 --> 01:46:55.370]  I understand the question.
[01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:56.290]  Let me answer it.
[01:46:57.506 --> 01:46:59.968]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[01:47:00.248 --> 01:47:05.472]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[01:47:05.612 --> 01:47:07.994]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[01:47:08.134 --> 01:47:10.937]  Are the majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[01:47:11.117 --> 01:47:14.039]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[01:47:14.239 --> 01:47:15.040]  One thing is certain.
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:22.284]  Having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the dollar, your investment will never be worthless.
[01:47:22.504 --> 01:47:25.125]  And it will protect you from that hidden tax, inflation.
[01:47:25.345 --> 01:47:29.728]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, the time is now.
[01:47:29.888 --> 01:47:32.369]  Gold is at an all-time high and continues to move up.
[01:47:32.569 --> 01:47:33.030]  I can help.
[01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:38.214]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel at 800-686-2237 at extension 108.
[01:47:38.355 --> 01:47:44.080]  Now take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:47.703]  Call 800-686-2237 extension 108.
[01:47:48.284 --> 01:47:51.347]  You've worked hard your whole life and I want to work hard for you.
[01:47:51.547 --> 01:47:52.828]  Call Peter Kranchnobel, 800-686-2237 extension 108.
[01:47:57.210 --> 01:47:59.512]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:47:59.572 --> 01:48:01.773]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:48:01.793 --> 01:48:04.675]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:48:05.116 --> 01:48:09.859]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:48:10.219 --> 01:48:14.422]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:48:14.722 --> 01:48:17.085]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:48:17.185 --> 01:48:19.609]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:48:19.629 --> 01:48:22.532]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:48:22.873 --> 01:48:30.483]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:48:30.803 --> 01:48:36.084]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:48:36.204 --> 01:48:39.005]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:42.486]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:48:42.746 --> 01:48:43.646]  And I got news for you.
[01:48:43.806 --> 01:48:45.106]  You're everyone else.
[01:48:45.146 --> 01:48:46.207]  Invisible Empire.

[01:49:56.567 --> 01:49:59.170]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:49:59.571 --> 01:50:04.538]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:50:04.898 --> 01:50:06.640]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:50:06.961 --> 01:50:11.787]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:50:11.967 --> 01:50:12.929]  How much do you want?
[01:50:13.149 --> 01:50:13.870]  When do you want it?
[01:50:14.250 --> 01:50:15.851]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:50:16.131 --> 01:50:16.951]  When will you need it?
[01:50:17.211 --> 01:50:19.272]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:20.512]  Will there be any food?
[01:50:20.752 --> 01:50:22.073]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:50:22.273 --> 01:50:27.335]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:50:27.535 --> 01:50:30.656]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:50:31.116 --> 01:50:34.619]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:50:34.939 --> 01:50:35.920]  How much will you need?
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:36.801]  We don't know.
[01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:37.982]  How much do you want?
[01:50:38.182 --> 01:50:38.922]  All you can get.
[01:50:39.103 --> 01:50:39.943]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:40.203 --> 01:50:42.966]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:50:43.246 --> 01:50:45.448]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:50:45.488 --> 01:50:46.468]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:32.605 --> 01:51:35.130]  Ron Paul scheduled to be joining us.
[01:51:37.355 --> 01:51:39.580]  Coming up in the next segment, the caller had a great point.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:43.488]  How do you defeat an army that doesn't come openly bearing its standard?
[01:51:45.404 --> 01:52:00.449]  How do you defeat a covert corporate army that comes in and builds takeover mechanisms that are actually businesses, so as they're taking you over, they're making larger and larger profits, so they're financing themselves all the way along.
[01:52:01.129 --> 01:52:02.970]  A microcosm of that is the G20.
[01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:07.211]  Bank heads openly have giant stock in all these private security firms.
[01:52:08.392 --> 01:52:09.212]  They had Canada
[01:52:10.322 --> 01:52:17.148]  Pay tens of millions of dollars to their own security firms and gave them the authorization to arrest protesters.
[01:52:17.708 --> 01:52:20.971]  And now it's come out that they weren't even licensed and there wasn't even a law.
[01:52:21.331 --> 01:52:28.577]  They just lawlessly came in and had private security goons, that's CBC TV today, and grabbed Canadian citizens off the street.
[01:52:30.854 --> 01:52:41.576]  impersonating officers and the cops don't care no one will be charged it's all selectively enforced and Charlie Veitch, an activist, jokes and calls himself the love police and so they arrest him
[01:52:43.291 --> 01:52:47.354]  And that's an example of how the corporate government is literally running everything.
[01:52:47.634 --> 01:52:56.641]  As I said earlier, you read these SPP documents and it's the North American Union meeting and you've got the corporate governors there calling all of the shots.
[01:52:57.362 --> 01:53:05.208]  They're there telling the Secretary of State and the other heads of the bureaucracies in Canada, the United States and Mexico what they're going to do.
[01:53:05.668 --> 01:53:07.890]  The corporations will have a vote amongst themselves
[01:53:08.590 --> 01:53:20.436]  And then they will deliver that vote in the meeting to the politicians and then they will swear to develop it extra legislatively, extra judicially through the executive and the bureaucracy.
[01:53:21.476 --> 01:53:26.939]  And you've got the media heads there and they go and then instruct all of their underlings on the policy.
[01:53:27.679 --> 01:53:38.084]  This is an outside corporate looting just like major corporations got together and went in 150 years ago or so and overthrew China and broke it up in many parts.
[01:53:39.278 --> 01:53:39.658]  That's all.
[01:53:39.678 --> 01:53:45.562]  I mean, it's just kind of like private corporations were operating all over the United States when they were taking it from Native Americans and killing them.
[01:53:45.862 --> 01:53:47.684]  Or the British East India Company in India.
[01:53:48.204 --> 01:53:49.885]  I mean, they would command British armies.
[01:53:50.305 --> 01:53:51.526]  This is a British model.
[01:53:51.566 --> 01:54:05.235]  If you read 200 years ago, the British East India Company, more than 200, in some cases, with huge battles with Maharajahs and other leaders that, you know, as they were conquering India, it took them hundreds of years from their ports to build and expand.
[01:54:06.016 --> 01:54:08.297]  And it would be huge British armies, British
[01:54:09.758 --> 01:54:23.724]  uh... and and uh... scottish troops and and indian forces they trained lined up and just huge three four day long battles and the british east india company would be there commanding those operations and that's the new world order
[01:54:24.833 --> 01:54:25.514]  And so you go.
[01:54:25.834 --> 01:54:31.639]  Why is the media telling me about 11 Russian spies and I should, you know, just literally have a heart attack and die?
[01:54:31.939 --> 01:54:34.181]  Why are they telling me about men in turbans that might kill me?
[01:54:34.201 --> 01:54:35.363]  I better give all my rights up.
[01:54:35.763 --> 01:54:39.266]  And then you get the government documents and all the trainings actually for you, the American people.
[01:54:39.646 --> 01:54:45.071]  See, they tell you give up your rights and let a police state unfold to stop the Russkies or stop the Arabs.
[01:54:45.131 --> 01:54:47.634]  And I'm sure if you gave the Russkies
[01:54:48.294 --> 01:54:49.915]  Unlimited power, they would take over.
[01:54:49.955 --> 01:54:51.776]  If you gave the Arabs unlimited power, they would.
[01:54:51.796 --> 01:54:52.836]  That's the nature of humans.
[01:54:53.176 --> 01:55:01.560]  But the group that has taken over, and is raping us, and has created 600 trillion in derivatives, and is doing all of this, is the globalist.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.121]  Globalism is tyranny.
[01:55:05.642 --> 01:55:07.643]  Globalism is treachery.
[01:55:07.783 --> 01:55:08.543]  It is treason.
[01:55:08.963 --> 01:55:12.525]  It is a corporate takeover of the United States.
[01:55:13.145 --> 01:55:14.265]  What did Smedley Butler say?
[01:55:14.305 --> 01:55:15.266]  He said, when big U.S.
[01:55:15.286 --> 01:55:17.467]  corporations, which aren't loyal to our country,
[01:55:18.479 --> 01:55:18.659]  He's
[01:55:36.192 --> 01:55:45.715]  Wrapped in the American flag for the very robber barons that had murdered the Indians and were murdering American squatters and people that started their own farms and ranches.
[01:55:46.055 --> 01:55:47.075]  I've looked at the statistics.
[01:55:47.395 --> 01:55:53.197]  There were almost as many white people killed by the railroad operatives and the gold mine operatives as there were Native Americans.
[01:55:54.468 --> 01:55:56.550]  That's corporatism and it's fascism.
[01:55:56.590 --> 01:55:57.611]  It's not free market.
[01:55:58.352 --> 01:56:00.114]  So really nothing new under the sun.
[01:56:00.975 --> 01:56:03.297]  This is a private mercenary army.
[01:56:03.857 --> 01:56:05.459]  Our military, our police, more and more.
[01:56:05.799 --> 01:56:08.362]  The CIA's had a coup of this country decades ago.
[01:56:09.343 --> 01:56:11.926]  And they just completed their takeover when they killed Kennedy.
[01:56:12.850 --> 01:56:23.453]  And we as a society have to make a decision about all of this, and whether or not we're going to let these offshore corporations that are engaged in a hostile corporate overthrow of our republic get away with it.
[01:56:23.713 --> 01:56:29.435]  See, they're getting rid of your due process, your property rights, your Second Amendment, everything that comes with a free society.
[01:56:31.135 --> 01:56:32.896]  So, globalism is death.
[01:56:32.996 --> 01:56:34.556]  Globalism is the end of America.
[01:56:34.836 --> 01:56:36.097]  Globalism is our enemy.
[01:56:36.577 --> 01:56:37.977]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:57:07.124 --> 01:57:14.207]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:57:14.507 --> 01:57:19.049]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:58:00.382 --> 01:58:01.303]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:01.623 --> 01:58:05.145]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:05.165 --> 01:58:07.787]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:58:07.807 --> 01:58:13.251]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[01:58:13.671 --> 01:58:19.935]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:58:20.335 --> 01:58:25.899]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:58:26.319 --> 01:58:30.022]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:58:30.482 --> 01:58:34.445]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:58:34.765 --> 01:58:40.290]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:58:40.730 --> 01:58:43.672]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:58:44.273 --> 01:58:45.714]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:58:46.254 --> 01:58:46.755]  It's here.

[02:00:11.010 --> 02:00:15.377]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:00:15.417 --> 02:00:19.463]  We're going to have Ron Paul with us until about 55 after today.
[02:00:19.483 --> 02:00:21.806]  Unless the bell rings, I've got to go vote.
[02:00:22.027 --> 02:00:23.268]  We appreciate him joining us.
[02:00:23.429 --> 02:00:24.570]  I'm just not going to mince words.
[02:00:24.590 --> 02:00:26.573]  I'm going to go through a laundry list.
[02:00:27.134 --> 02:00:27.695]  of issues.
[02:00:27.755 --> 02:00:35.400]  Congressman, as you know, the FCC has said they want to start taking over the Internet, the Federal Communications Commission.
[02:00:36.021 --> 02:00:42.526]  We also have the Federal Trade Commission saying they want to start taxing the Internet and literally funding old line media.
[02:00:43.006 --> 02:00:45.468]  That sounds like it violates the First Amendment and so many others.
[02:00:46.289 --> 02:00:48.270]  We have Kagan with her anti-
[02:00:49.591 --> 02:00:58.362]  First Amendment statements about disappearing speech that the government finds to be hurtful, as long as the government feels it's a moral reason they can restrict our speech.
[02:00:59.664 --> 02:01:06.652]  We've got the Federal Election Commission coming after Campaign for Liberty, as you put out in your press release yesterday, saying you can't
[02:01:07.313 --> 02:01:11.715]  Uh, put out, uh, letters telling people how members of Congress have voted.
[02:01:11.735 --> 02:01:16.518]  I mean, this is 180 degrees the opposite of what our country was founded on.
[02:01:16.538 --> 02:01:18.259]  I can't even believe this is happening.
[02:01:18.459 --> 02:01:20.200]  Can you speak to that and where this is going?
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:27.144]  Well, it's going in the wrong direction, obviously, and, uh, that is what I understand about Campaign for Liberty.
[02:01:27.184 --> 02:01:31.706]  They've had, uh, somebody at least make a charge and file a complaint
[02:01:32.426 --> 02:01:37.211]  That there was a violation, but it probably won't hold up.
[02:01:37.231 --> 02:01:37.911]  Hopefully.
[02:01:38.232 --> 02:01:45.379]  But the whole idea that people think they can and harass you and you go through this legal maneuvering because that is the goal of many is to control us.
[02:01:45.779 --> 02:01:48.221]  I think the main goal is also to control the Internet.
[02:01:48.261 --> 02:01:49.683]  They're very interested in that.
[02:01:50.123 --> 02:02:02.966]  The other day we had what sounded like a pretty benign vote, it was under suspension, and that was to praise the idea that government and private entities would study and work together on how to provide cyber security.
[02:02:03.795 --> 02:02:06.198]  And I don't know if there's anybody else that voted against it.
[02:02:06.258 --> 02:02:09.963]  I voted against it just on this principle that we don't need that.
[02:02:10.023 --> 02:02:17.832]  We don't need these private sources cooperating with the federal resources, you know, the government forces in order to have cyber security.
[02:02:17.852 --> 02:02:20.355]  I don't think the government's interested in our security.
[02:02:20.415 --> 02:02:22.257]  They're interested in their security.
[02:02:23.078 --> 02:02:28.322]  But, yes, I think everything is going, especially with this administration, is going in the wrong direction.
[02:02:28.342 --> 02:02:32.485]  And I've always been fearful of them wanting to take over the Internet.
[02:02:32.525 --> 02:02:40.870]  You know, they've made this announcement that, you know, if necessary, they might even just close down the Internet, which would be devastating to all of us.
[02:02:41.290 --> 02:02:42.892]  Well, that's what Lieberman said on CNN.
[02:02:42.912 --> 02:02:44.813]  He said, China has this power.
[02:02:44.893 --> 02:02:45.393]  We need it.
[02:02:45.513 --> 02:02:51.157]  And I would imagine they'll shut it down a few times, but turn it right back on and say, see, we saved it.
[02:02:53.456 --> 02:02:57.460]  Unfortunately, I'm afraid that could very well happen.
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:03.845]  Well, expanding on that, two things, and I want your specific take on this, Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:03:03.885 --> 02:03:05.126]  We appreciate you joining us today.
[02:03:05.727 --> 02:03:17.277]  This shows that we're really having an effect, that they're harassing Campaign for Liberty, that they're openly coming out and saying they want to restrict free speech, put taxes, quote, on conspiracy theories, and cast Sunstein at the White House.
[02:03:17.677 --> 02:03:20.661]  The regulations are said like anthropogenic global warming.
[02:03:20.961 --> 02:03:23.965]  If you deny that, maybe we should tax you or fine you.
[02:03:23.985 --> 02:03:34.558]  I mean, the fact that they want to shut us up shows that we're gaining ground, A. And B, doesn't it reveal to everyone just how tyrannical these people really are?
[02:03:35.402 --> 02:03:46.650]  I think it does, and it's a real job to sort all this out because sometimes people think that all we need are a couple more Republicans and that'll solve the problem, but that's not necessarily the case.
[02:03:47.070 --> 02:03:54.355]  But right now, the Democrats who are in charge, and they're the ones who are wanting to radicalize this whole thing.
[02:03:56.136 --> 02:04:07.061]  And, uh, we know that that is the agenda of many, you know, in the establishment, and that is more government control and less personal freedom, more taxes, the whole mess that we've been fighting.
[02:04:07.662 --> 02:04:14.426]  But I still hold out that the people are waking up.
[02:04:14.586 --> 02:04:25.853]  And it may well be that the opposition, that is the government, is getting very concerned that the people are becoming alert from all that has been done in the Freedom Movement.
[02:04:28.892 --> 02:04:32.414]  Uh, DeMint reported that 94% of Senate bills are not read.
[02:04:32.434 --> 02:04:34.015]  I know the number in the House is similar.
[02:04:34.035 --> 02:04:38.457]  Uh, and so, 94% of the bills aren't even looked at.
[02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:42.178]  Special interests are writing, and we've had an offshore corporate coup.
[02:04:43.179 --> 02:04:55.125]  And then, separately, uh, they passed the law in the House, what, two days ago, to not let, quote, special interests tell you how someone is voted months before an election, a restriction of free speech.
[02:04:56.005 --> 02:05:07.914]  So, they're not reading the bills, and they don't want us to know how they voted, and the FEC is trying to keep Campaign for Liberty from being able to tell people how folks voted.
[02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:10.015]  I mean, this really is tyranny.
[02:05:10.796 --> 02:05:18.381]  Well, yes, and they want to make sure that independent organizations and corporations can't spend their money or tell people how they vote.
[02:05:19.119 --> 02:05:33.346]  But, you know, there are corporations, and this is where I think you can fall into the category, because if you run a newspaper or you have a TV show, that's a corporation, can be a corporation, but they're not going to regulate them.
[02:05:33.706 --> 02:05:41.850]  So if there is an organization or a political action committee or a private group or corporation who wants to tell people how they vote, no, you might be restricted.
[02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:49.397]  But they never think for a minute they should restrict the media, assuming that the media is always going to be radical left and defend their candidates.
[02:05:49.998 --> 02:06:06.794]  But, you know, there's just a few people on cable and radio and other places that, you know, the way I would understand what they're doing, they still haven't come to trying to regulate what the TV stations are saying or what the radios are saying.
[02:06:07.881 --> 02:06:20.346]  Congressman, going into another very important subject, I almost fell off my chair last Friday when the Washington Post admitted in an article that they're set to pass the financial reform bill.
[02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:22.887]  They admitted there's $600 trillion in derivatives.
[02:06:23.447 --> 02:06:29.190]  They went on, that was the first time I'd seen that in a mainstream publication, just to admit that the Federal Reserve is going to have a new
[02:06:29.970 --> 02:06:30.290]  I don't
[02:06:48.439 --> 02:07:02.032]  And that really, out of the crisis, the big mega-banks, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and others created, they are now going to get even more power over the rest of the economy, and that this is an expanded Federal Reserve coup of America.
[02:07:02.272 --> 02:07:03.553]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:07:04.554 --> 02:07:09.938]  Yeah, and I think you've described it rather well, but that's not the way they claim it is.
[02:07:10.338 --> 02:07:13.240]  You know, they claim, well, this is going to protect the consumers.
[02:07:13.741 --> 02:07:15.182]  It's not run by the Fed.
[02:07:15.282 --> 02:07:16.543]  They don't have authority.
[02:07:16.623 --> 02:07:18.984]  But it's going to be in the Federal Reserve.
[02:07:19.485 --> 02:07:21.526]  They do not have control over the policy.
[02:07:21.546 --> 02:07:22.587]  But guess what?
[02:07:23.007 --> 02:07:24.228]  Guess who pays for it?
[02:07:24.308 --> 02:07:25.469]  The Federal Reserve pays for it.
[02:07:25.469 --> 02:07:26.469]  We're good to go.
[02:07:46.737 --> 02:07:53.864]  Um, you know, it's very bad for all of us, and it does give more power to all the regulators, especially the Federal Reserve.
[02:07:53.884 --> 02:08:00.270]  I don't know whether you want to talk about it now, but that's where I offered my motion to recommit, dealing with the audit defense bill.
[02:08:00.671 --> 02:08:01.732]  Were you up on that?
[02:08:01.972 --> 02:08:03.993]  No, that's exactly where I wanted to go next.
[02:08:04.013 --> 02:08:07.916]  I wanted to illustrate for listeners that just joined us that Congressman Ron Paul is here.
[02:08:07.996 --> 02:08:12.459]  Twenty-something years ago in Congress, he couldn't get one co-sponsor, and I wanted to make this point.
[02:08:12.979 --> 02:08:15.160]  It seems the House and Senate are schizophrenic.
[02:08:15.461 --> 02:08:17.102]  The House votes by two-thirds.
[02:08:17.882 --> 02:08:38.179]  Uh, to pass your bill to truly audit the quasi-governmental, uh, banking holding company, the Federal Reserve, that took over in 1913, but then, which is the right thing to do, but it never passed the Senate properly, uh, and then now they're back giving the Federal Reserve even more power outside of government and Congress, uh, to regulate themselves.
[02:08:38.519 --> 02:08:39.420]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:43.543]  So, uh, break that oxymoron down for us and tell us about your new amendment.
[02:08:43.743 --> 02:08:49.564]  Well, it tells you about the hypocrisy of this whole place and how it works and how powerful the Fed is.
[02:08:50.104 --> 02:08:50.584]  You're right.
[02:08:50.644 --> 02:08:57.406]  We passed it in the Financial Services Committee, the Audit the Fed Bill, and it was part of the reform package.
[02:08:57.466 --> 02:09:01.507]  Then it came to the House floor and they kept it in, so the House floor supported it.
[02:09:02.027 --> 02:09:03.907]  We have 320 co-sponsors.
[02:09:04.387 --> 02:09:07.388]  Then it goes to the conference with the Senate and they drop it.
[02:09:07.888 --> 02:09:13.010]  They put some things in there to look at the Fed, which are slightly helpful, but they get rid of the true audit.
[02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:16.212]  So when the bill comes back to the House, guess what?
[02:09:16.352 --> 02:09:18.793]  We don't have the audit bill provision in there.
[02:09:19.313 --> 02:09:23.835]  So I was able to offer an amendment which was a recommitment amendment.
[02:09:24.535 --> 02:09:28.198]  Send it back to committee and put back in the true audit.
[02:09:28.739 --> 02:09:34.324]  And we had an up and down vote on that and we lost it by a significant amount.
[02:09:34.344 --> 02:09:37.046]  320 co-sponsors and we lost it.
[02:09:37.066 --> 02:09:44.813]  114 people who were co-sponsors of this bill switched and voted against the bill that they were co-sponsors of.
[02:09:46.014 --> 02:09:56.247]  And now they've got the feds sicked on Campaign for Liberty and every other organization so that you can't tell the public that they flip-flopped and engaged in treason.
[02:09:56.327 --> 02:10:04.297]  They know that there's been a major political realignment not left or right but towards the Constitution and that all incumbents across the country
[02:10:04.697 --> 02:10:14.107]  are either losing or on the verge of losing in the primaries and they are scared to death and they're trying to stop us from being able to communicate to them the truth.
[02:10:14.488 --> 02:10:18.292]  This is treason against our way of government and our life.
[02:10:18.837 --> 02:10:22.060]  I don't think they're going to stop the information from getting out.
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:25.243]  The internet is, at the moment, still too big.
[02:10:25.283 --> 02:10:26.243]  They can't control it.
[02:10:26.704 --> 02:10:38.134]  People are going to find out, and they still have access to government records, and they can find out who those 114 individuals were who flipped on this vote.
[02:10:38.634 --> 02:10:46.401]  If we're worth our salt and this issue is important, it will play a role in the elections this fall.
[02:10:47.090 --> 02:10:53.114]  Alright, now I want to rocket through points with Congressman Ron Paul and the time we've got left with him.
[02:10:53.134 --> 02:10:56.116]  The way I read the Supreme Court ruling, it's...
[02:10:57.162 --> 02:10:57.462]  I think?
[02:11:27.622 --> 02:11:29.403]  Well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
[02:11:29.443 --> 02:11:33.284]  I'm still hoping that it will be because it's certainly perceived that way.
[02:11:33.444 --> 02:11:38.926]  And the people who hate guns and don't believe we should have them, they're hysterical, they're going nuts.
[02:11:39.486 --> 02:11:46.909]  So I'm hopeful that, yes, more people will have guns and more people will be able to defend themselves.
[02:11:46.949 --> 02:11:49.910]  You know, things have improved slightly in Washington.
[02:11:50.670 --> 02:12:02.793]  I hope they've improved, even if it's not the total package, it'll improve slightly in Chicago and then maybe we'll be of great benefit to it because what they'll probably find out is that the crime rate will go down.
[02:12:02.813 --> 02:12:08.275]  It has in every other city, so I haven't written it off saying that, no, this won't improve things.
[02:12:08.315 --> 02:12:13.936]  I think more people are going to have guns in Chicago in order to defend themselves.
[02:12:14.602 --> 02:12:23.745]  Well I agree with you to a certain extent because I don't like having concealed carry because that turns a right into a privilege in states where it's already legal to carry a gun holstered.
[02:12:24.045 --> 02:12:40.450]  But if you pass it in Texas or Florida and the crime rates drop by over 20% in both states, the same numbers in other states, even though it's a restriction to a certain extent, it illustrates that more guns means less crime and so you win the overall intellectual war.
[02:12:40.930 --> 02:12:45.454]  That's a powerful message, and I think more and more people are coming around to that.
[02:12:45.914 --> 02:12:48.296]  And I think, politically, we generally have won this.
[02:12:48.336 --> 02:12:51.899]  They sort of come into some of these regulations through the back door.
[02:12:51.959 --> 02:12:59.925]  You know, in the last several elections, the Democratic candidate usually doesn't go out preaching about how he's going to round up the guns and register guns.
[02:12:59.945 --> 02:13:01.026]  They stay away from that.
[02:13:01.066 --> 02:13:03.188]  They pretend that, well, we're not going to do that.
[02:13:03.208 --> 02:13:04.049]  We're not going to do that.
[02:13:04.129 --> 02:13:07.812]  But backdoor legislation, they generally are always trying to do that.
[02:13:08.988 --> 02:13:10.809]  Let's talk about the oil spill.
[02:13:11.949 --> 02:13:17.792]  And again, just to preface this, BP gave orders that they knew would cause a problem.
[02:13:17.812 --> 02:13:21.734]  It turns out two months before it was leaking, BP is one of the biggest contributors to Obama.
[02:13:21.974 --> 02:13:23.335]  They funded the carbon tax.
[02:13:23.535 --> 02:13:27.057]  They've got a global governance office with a vice president over it.
[02:13:28.277 --> 02:13:32.119]  They've always wanted to nationalize oil, so they get an inside deal.
[02:13:32.499 --> 02:13:34.500]  I'm very suspicious of how this has been handled.
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:36.120]  We're 70-plus days in.
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:42.003]  Obama has blocked a Taiwanese ship that can get half a million barrels a day scooped up.
[02:13:42.883 --> 02:13:45.304]  They've blocked over 30 other mega-ships.
[02:13:45.644 --> 02:13:49.545]  Now that the hurricanes are coming in, he's saying he may look at letting them come in.
[02:13:49.906 --> 02:13:53.787]  Once that oil gets blown in, they're going to have a major disaster.
[02:13:53.807 --> 02:13:56.048]  The Washington Post is talking about forced
[02:13:56.568 --> 02:13:57.469]  Evacuations.
[02:13:57.569 --> 02:14:00.291]  Obama's answer is, give me the carbon tax.
[02:14:00.792 --> 02:14:03.254]  Rahm Emanuel said, don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:14:04.055 --> 02:14:08.338]  I don't see this as Obama versus BP as the media has phrased it.
[02:14:08.699 --> 02:14:14.123]  Really, this is Obama working with BP to try to get his carbon tax.
[02:14:14.203 --> 02:14:16.585]  Congressman, this is out in international water.
[02:14:17.166 --> 02:14:19.468]  Why don't we just have the salvagers in there to begin with?
[02:14:19.708 --> 02:14:22.931]  How can Obama tell people 50 miles out in the Gulf what to do?
[02:14:23.291 --> 02:14:24.092]  Well, you forgot.
[02:14:24.492 --> 02:14:25.874]  He can write executive orders.
[02:14:25.974 --> 02:14:29.518]  He can write executive orders and do anything they want.
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.402]  So, it is a real mess.
[02:14:32.782 --> 02:14:38.709]  You know, if a state needs some manpower, generally they don't have manpower that might be able to help out.
[02:14:38.789 --> 02:14:40.952]  That would be maybe their National Guard units.
[02:14:41.232 --> 02:14:44.554]  They're all over in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:14:44.674 --> 02:14:50.638]  I would say that, you know, if an emergency like this, this might be an incentive to say, hey, why don't you bring these troops home?
[02:14:50.678 --> 02:14:55.060]  And maybe even some different states would share some of their people to help.
[02:14:55.241 --> 02:14:59.023]  I mean, it's practically like an invasion, the way this oil is coming in.
[02:14:59.723 --> 02:15:18.033]  But I think that, yes, I'm very suspicious of what BP and our government is doing and the Obama administration, and that's why I've even challenged the principle of this agreement they have to set up, you know, this fund, this $20 billion fund.
[02:15:18.354 --> 02:15:22.296]  Sounds like a lot of money, but it sounds like there could be a lot of mischief, too.
[02:15:23.096 --> 02:15:25.597]  And that was done by just executive order.
[02:15:25.637 --> 02:15:27.458]  The president declared, we're going to have this up.
[02:15:27.978 --> 02:15:34.941]  And then he came to the Congress and asked even for more authority to go any place asking questions and trying to figure out what to do.
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:44.643]  Yeah, I saw a report that they're blocking, I'm sorry to interrupt, I saw a report in the AP yesterday, they're trying to block Republican groups from going and looking at the Gulf.
[02:15:44.723 --> 02:15:46.083]  I mean, Obama doesn't have that power.
[02:15:46.103 --> 02:15:54.906]  Yeah, well, he might take it he doesn't deserve that power, but sometimes they assume power that they have, but just, you know, no he doesn't.
[02:15:54.946 --> 02:15:56.486]  That's not a proper power that he has.
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:08.464]  I'm not too pleased either, and I think, you know, a BP corporation is in bed with government, so you have to be suspect.
[02:16:09.064 --> 02:16:13.966]  Just think of how much we spend protecting their oil well and their oil drilling.
[02:16:13.986 --> 02:16:15.727]  What do you think we're over in the Middle East for?
[02:16:15.787 --> 02:16:17.648]  We're not over there to spread democracy.
[02:16:18.068 --> 02:16:23.531]  We're over there to protect oil companies, and BP just happens to be over there as well.
[02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:29.971]  Did you see the video, you probably didn't two weeks ago, but it was on Drudge and Infowars.com and everywhere else.
[02:16:30.591 --> 02:16:45.375]  Senator Kyle said he was in a closed-door meeting with Obama and said, look, tens of thousands dead, 80 miles to 100 miles, illegal aliens, they're shutting down national parks, the border's collapsing, Mexico's collapsed, and Obama said, I'm not going to fix the border until you pass amnesty.
[02:16:45.755 --> 02:16:47.095]  I need to use that crisis.
[02:16:47.115 --> 02:16:51.696]  This is a quote, and Senator Kyle said that this is basically
[02:16:52.276 --> 02:16:57.619]  Holding us hostage in a form of terrorism, I mean, that sounds like an impeachable offense, Congressman.
[02:16:57.859 --> 02:17:02.041]  And to have a senator say he was in a meeting with Obama, A, what's your take on that?
[02:17:02.541 --> 02:17:11.805]  And B, I mean, that is a false flag to let the crime continue and not protect our border when that's in the Constitution, one of the few duties of the feds.
[02:17:11.845 --> 02:17:12.686]  What would you say to that?
[02:17:13.496 --> 02:17:17.078]  Well, since I wasn't at that meeting and what exactly was said, I don't know.
[02:17:17.158 --> 02:17:20.879]  So it would have to be up to the Senator to decide what to do with it.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:27.142]  But they certainly don't act like they have an incentive to do much with the borders.
[02:17:27.222 --> 02:17:32.385]  And that, of course, could eventually lead to a national security problem as well.
[02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:36.774]  Well, okay, Congressman Ron Paul, what about his executive order?
[02:17:36.854 --> 02:17:46.845]  And now they say they're going to sue Arizona, and they're saying Arizona isn't allowed to protect itself when a third of the state is now being denied to the citizens.
[02:17:47.105 --> 02:17:48.787]  I mean, this is confirmed.
[02:17:49.288 --> 02:17:55.635]  What's your view on the constitutionality of an executive order by the president to legalize the illegals?
[02:17:57.202 --> 02:18:00.003]  Well, he can't do it unilaterally like that.
[02:18:00.123 --> 02:18:04.625]  No, Congress would have to act and take a policy on that and write the rules.
[02:18:04.645 --> 02:18:08.127]  The federal government has authority over our borders.
[02:18:08.797 --> 02:18:15.980]  But, you know, it should be that the private landowners should have a lot of authority, along with the states themselves with jurisdiction.
[02:18:17.321 --> 02:18:28.465]  And yet, instead of permitting them to exert their authority over their own land, whether it's their own private or the state, the federal government comes in and says, you can't do it.
[02:18:28.605 --> 02:18:32.667]  So they're acting perversely to what I think the federal government ought to be doing.
[02:18:33.823 --> 02:18:51.410]  Congressman, I know you're a busy man, but have you had a chance to watch Kagan and the hearings, and then expanding on that, all of her open statements about socialism being great and the government can disappear speech, going back to that, are you concerned about Kagan?
[02:18:52.410 --> 02:18:58.253]  Oh, I am, but I'm sure if he put ten new ones up in place of her, I'd be very concerned, too.
[02:18:58.313 --> 02:19:00.894]  I haven't watched the hearings, but I've read about her.
[02:19:01.756 --> 02:19:14.077]  And she certainly is not going to be a great defender of the Constitution, although she's going to make it sound like she is, so I'm not too encouraged with that appointment for sure.
[02:19:15.526 --> 02:19:19.168]  Congressman, what's your take on the Russian spy situation?
[02:19:19.208 --> 02:19:22.350]  It seems like they're trying to kick off a new Cold War with that.
[02:19:22.390 --> 02:19:26.132]  And my issue is, globalization is treason.
[02:19:26.572 --> 02:19:30.694]  Globalization is corporations and megabanks taking over our government.
[02:19:31.155 --> 02:19:38.479]  And so what is the difference between Russian spies sneaking around and megacorporations coming in and openly buying off our politicians?
[02:19:39.642 --> 02:19:42.443]  Yeah, I think this is a little bit of hype.
[02:19:42.523 --> 02:19:48.746]  I think even the media, the mainstream media is sort of making fun of all this, and I think rightfully so.
[02:19:49.446 --> 02:19:52.367]  They just didn't look like a great threat to me.
[02:19:52.387 --> 02:20:00.170]  And I had somebody in for a luncheon today that was sort of knowledgeable about this, and he said that
[02:20:00.774 --> 02:20:03.676]  He said that there's so much spying going on in the world.
[02:20:03.716 --> 02:20:13.563]  Other countries come in here, they do it routinely, and we're all over the place, all over the world, and it's almost, he described it almost like a game they play.
[02:20:13.663 --> 02:20:22.489]  I mean, it's really not serious intrigue, and my guess is that people like to stir things up, scare the people, and who knows?
[02:20:22.509 --> 02:20:25.211]  I hope it doesn't lead to another Cold War with the Russians.
[02:20:25.231 --> 02:20:30.295]  I don't think they're looking for trouble, and we certainly shouldn't be looking for it either.
[02:20:30.715 --> 02:20:32.756]  Alright, Congressman Ron Paul, we appreciate your time.
[02:20:32.836 --> 02:20:39.019]  In closing, and I know you'll say, well, if I was president, I would only have the powers of the president, but what would you recommend?
[02:20:39.079 --> 02:20:39.640]  What would you do?
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:53.047]  If Ron Paul would have been elected back in 2008, as we all wish you would have been, forecasting everything that's now happened, if you would have been elected, what would you have done with the oil spill, and what would you be doing now?
[02:20:54.249 --> 02:20:57.630]  I'd probably work at getting the government out of the way.
[02:20:57.690 --> 02:21:04.411]  I would have done everything possible to alleviate any federal restrictions on the state or property owners.
[02:21:04.791 --> 02:21:09.692]  I would have accepted anybody who had an offer to come in and help.
[02:21:09.832 --> 02:21:14.533]  I would have worked to remove any liability limitations on BP.
[02:21:18.329 --> 02:21:31.561]  And I would have, of course, by the time we had the oil spill, I would have had all the guard units back in the individual states, and they would have had the right to use their guard units as they pleased.
[02:21:32.001 --> 02:21:39.808]  And I would actually encourage other guard units and not pretend that the guard units belong to the President, but they belong to the states and the government.
[02:21:40.388 --> 02:21:45.513]  And I think they could have done a lot to alleviate some of the damage.
[02:21:46.073 --> 02:21:53.180]  I do not believe that there would have been any magic with any one individual who said, oh, I know how to cap this thing, let me do it.
[02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:57.724]  I actually do believe they're trying seriously to stop this.
[02:21:57.744 --> 02:21:59.686]  I don't think it serves anybody's benefit.
[02:22:00.266 --> 02:22:13.856]  But I think right now the assumption is that the government, you know, didn't have a role to play and what they did was actually made this worse because of the rules of pushing them out into deep sea drilling.
[02:22:13.936 --> 02:22:15.397]  That was part of the problem too.
[02:22:15.698 --> 02:22:19.720]  But I would not have closed down drilling like Obama wants to do.
[02:22:19.821 --> 02:22:21.962]  That's not going to help us.
[02:22:22.282 --> 02:22:23.183]  That just makes the unemployment
[02:22:24.215 --> 02:22:30.258]  Well, the Russians and the Chinese and the people in Brazil, they're not stopping drilling in the Gulf.
[02:22:30.298 --> 02:22:31.178]  We don't own the Gulf.
[02:22:31.418 --> 02:22:33.399]  He's just stopped any companies in the U.S.
[02:22:33.859 --> 02:22:37.821]  I mean, this is outrageous, and they're going to use it to pass cap-and-trade.
[02:22:38.241 --> 02:22:41.143]  Congressman Ron Paul, everybody's got to get behind Campaign for Liberty.
[02:22:41.163 --> 02:22:42.563]  They've got to get behind Rand Paul.
[02:22:42.884 --> 02:22:48.786]  We're going to win this, and we appreciate your leadership, and we know you're there working tirelessly for us in Congress.
[02:22:48.846 --> 02:22:49.647]  God bless you, sir.
[02:22:49.867 --> 02:22:50.107]  Thank you.
[02:22:50.856 --> 02:22:51.677]  All right, bye-bye.
[02:22:51.717 --> 02:22:53.999]  There goes Congressman Ron Paul, and we are out of time.
[02:22:54.039 --> 02:22:55.160]  No more time for calls.
[02:22:55.740 --> 02:22:59.704]  I got to most of the news today, and I want to say great job to the crew.
[02:22:59.864 --> 02:23:06.110]  I also want to encourage listeners to support the online video, bookstore, shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[02:23:06.610 --> 02:23:09.172]  We're not funded by the New World Order or big global corporations.
[02:23:09.192 --> 02:23:13.496]  We're funded by small sponsors and by you buying the books, the t-shirts, the videos.
[02:23:13.516 --> 02:23:21.662]  We've got a lot of new books and videos and specials and free t-shirt deals up on InfoWars.com or you can always call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:23:22.022 --> 02:23:29.468]  We've got some other very informative guests joining us tomorrow and next week, of course, steaming towards the 4th of July.
[02:23:29.488 --> 02:23:33.591]  I hope everyone will remember what the 4th of July is really all about.
[02:23:34.432 --> 02:23:37.435]  And at the end here, I wanted to thank Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:23:38.455 --> 02:23:40.777]  That's just a wonderful sponsor, and you really need to listen to me.
[02:23:40.957 --> 02:23:48.463]  I search high and low because I like green energy foods that are just raw foods, you know, that aren't pasteurized, that haven't lost their value.
[02:23:48.503 --> 02:23:51.065]  This is the best out there, and of course it's owned by Patriots.
[02:23:51.886 --> 02:23:52.867]  And it's very affordable.
[02:23:53.148 --> 02:23:55.751]  It has 20 organic superfood ingredients in it.
[02:23:56.392 --> 02:24:00.517]  It won the 2009 Superfood for Mike Adams, the Health Ranger Award.
[02:24:00.537 --> 02:24:04.582]  They have their Nutri-Cafe coffee, but really their inner food is their classic.
[02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:07.886]  They got a lot of great products, all made right here in the USA.
[02:24:08.527 --> 02:24:16.770]  And it's just raw foods, concentrated, and it's just a few scoops in the morning with your orange juice or apple juice or with water or coconut juice, whatever you like.
[02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:20.331]  Innerfood, E-N-E-R, food, innerfood.com, E-N-E-R, food.com, or 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, innerfood.com.
[02:24:20.511 --> 02:24:22.151]  And lastly, it's not enough to just own guns.
[02:24:22.432 --> 02:24:23.572]  You need to know how to use guns.
[02:24:33.395 --> 02:24:34.195]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:54.941]  It is FrontSight.com.
[02:24:54.981 --> 02:24:56.142]  Front Sight Firearms Training.
[02:24:56.502 --> 02:24:57.603]  FrontSight.com.
[02:24:57.843 --> 02:25:00.144]  Go to FrontSight.com for your free training and free gun.

[02:25:05.207 --> 02:25:06.167]  FrontSight.com.
[02:25:07.268 --> 02:25:10.490]  And just in closing, again, the broadcast is exploding.
[02:25:12.116 --> 02:25:13.637]  More and more people are tuning in.
[02:25:13.817 --> 02:25:16.338]  You are the reason we're getting on so many AM and FM stations.
[02:25:16.779 --> 02:25:23.162]  You are the reason so many people are downloading the free MP3 podcast every day and sharing it in the free iPhone app.
[02:25:23.443 --> 02:25:25.444]  Listen where you want, when you want.
[02:25:25.484 --> 02:25:30.507]  We've got the free app too for the Android out there listed on the listen page.
[02:25:30.867 --> 02:25:32.428]  All of it's at Infowars.com.

[02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:36.250]  God bless.
