[00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:09.722]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:11.303]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:12.843]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:17.044]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:23.126]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:32.189]  It is Thursday, the first day of the new month.
[00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.689]  July 1st.
[00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.602]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:52.710]  We will simulcast the second, third, and fourth hour in living video color at PrisonPlanet.TV for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.993]  But this is first and foremost a radio broadcast.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.766]  We only have one guest joining us today and that is Congressman Ron Paul sometime in the last hour.
[00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.128]  He is on the House floor today.
[00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:15.215]  They are expecting votes so he could end up even being on conceivably earlier and occasionally he has to come on the next day so it could be tomorrow.
[00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:15.795]  We've interviewed him
[00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:21.618]  Literally, it's got to be close to 100 times in the last 15 years.
[00:01:21.618 --> 00:01:26.200]  And when he is on the floor, about 10% of the time he ends up coming on the next day.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:40.425]  But Congressman Ron Paul scheduled, as they say across the pond, with incredibly important intel on the scuttlebutt in Congress on a strike on Iran that is clearly in the making.
[00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:42.690]  They've set the table.
[00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.092]  They're bringing out the roast suckling pig.
[00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:51.597]  And the question is, will they start thrusting their daggers into the flesh?
[00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:55.321]  We'll also get his take on the economy that he's predicted, of course, decades ago.
[00:01:55.321 --> 00:02:01.646]  What is now happening, what these bankers always do in every nation they control with fractional reserve banking.
[00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:03.067]  Really, it's quite simple.
[00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:04.408]  Money laundering slash
[00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:10.160]  Counterfeiting, but it's not counterfeit because they run the government criminally.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.541]  So they get away with it and leave you holding the bag after the Ponzi scheme implodes.
[00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:21.944]  And so we'll talk to Congressman Ron Paul about that as well and a lot of other central issues like the Federal Elections Commission starting an investigation.
[00:02:21.944 --> 00:02:27.927]  This is very serious of Campaign for Liberty and openly saying that they're not allowed.
[00:02:27.927 --> 00:02:33.189]  The key here is to tell American voters how congressmen voted.
[00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:41.977]  And the House has passed an even more draconian bill where there can be no free speech six months out from an election of any political organization.
[00:02:41.977 --> 00:02:48.362]  Just, you can't tell voting records, you can't even give your opinion, no free speech in America.
[00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:50.924]  And they're going after the Internet.
[00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:54.046]  I mean, it's so brazen, so naked.
[00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:06.405]  That it is hard to deal with, hard to even be able to face up to, even when you understand how corrupt and oppressive this system is.
[00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:08.226]  It is naked.
[00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:10.507]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:13.349]  This is a criminal conspiracy takeover fact.
[00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:22.073]  Now, every day I start the broadcast, and here we are, July 1st, 2010, and things are only intensifying.
[00:03:22.073 --> 00:03:30.218]  And I say that the straights are becoming more dire by the minute, that the quickening is accelerating, that everything's coming to a head.
[00:03:30.218 --> 00:03:33.741]  The good is coming to the fore, the bad is coming to the fore.
[00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.901]  The evil is coming to the surface.
[00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:37.982]  The absurd is coming to the surface.
[00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:39.623]  The corrupt is coming to the surface.
[00:03:39.623 --> 00:03:42.103]  The honor is coming to the surface.
[00:03:42.103 --> 00:03:44.464]  The patriotism is coming to the surface.
[00:03:44.464 --> 00:03:47.385]  The love of God and the truth is coming to the surface.
[00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:49.045]  The love of evil is coming to the surface.
[00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:53.627]  I mean, the battle is on between good and evil.
[00:03:53.627 --> 00:03:56.287]  And it's only going to get more insane from here.
[00:03:56.287 --> 00:03:58.348]  I have a giant stack of financial news.
[00:03:58.348 --> 00:03:59.448]  We're going to cover that first.
[00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:01.629]  I don't have to tell you the stock market is in free fall.
[00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:05.567]  The media is now admitting we're in a depression.
[00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:06.847]  This is all being done by design.
[00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:09.028]  We've been in a depression for years.
[00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:26.833]  All the real economic numbers of savings versus debt, public, private, corporate, international, of the types of jobs people have, the deindustrialization, the unemployment numbers, the inflation numbers,
[00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.090]  We're sunk, okay?
[00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:38.842]  When you talk about 600 trillion, as the Washington Post admits last week, quite amazing they'd admit that, it's more like 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500 trillion.
[00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:43.748]  This is like shooting someone 8 million times with a .45 caliber handgun.
[00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:44.729]  They are going to die.
[00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:48.762]  I mean, the overkill is so ridiculous.
[00:04:48.762 --> 00:04:50.204]  We're dead.
[00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:54.790]  We're a wasteland unless we arrest the Goldman Sachs bankers and reverse all this, okay?
[00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.012]  There's no debating it.
[00:04:56.012 --> 00:04:57.754]  Either they go or we go.
[00:04:57.754 --> 00:04:58.295]  You understand?
[00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:03.461]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:08.786]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:10.848]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.848 --> 00:05:15.853]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.853 --> 00:05:17.035]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.035 --> 00:05:18.156]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.156 --> 00:05:20.037]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.037 --> 00:05:21.119]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:23.321]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:24.302]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.642 --> 00:05:28.705]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:31.427]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.427 --> 00:05:35.009]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.831]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:40.072]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:40.973]  We don't know.
[00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.074]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:43.014]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:44.095]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:47.157]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.157 --> 00:05:48.898]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:55.445]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:00.765 --> 00:06:07.206]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:06:07.206 --> 00:06:12.467]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:26.010]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McIlvaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.813]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.184]  Again, that website's www.thefallofamerica.net or call 800-655-1577.
[00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:50.105]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:51.426]  fallofamerica.net
[00:06:59.107 --> 00:07:03.650]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.570]  Number 1.
[00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.993]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:08.853]  Number 2.
[00:07:08.853 --> 00:07:13.756]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:13.756 --> 00:07:14.497]  It's true.
[00:07:14.497 --> 00:07:19.360]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.200]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.783]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:23.783 --> 00:07:27.465]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:27.685 --> 00:07:28.465]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.465 --> 00:07:31.227]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.227 --> 00:07:34.909]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:35.709]  Number 5.
[00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:39.851]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:44.914]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:49.076]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:50.877]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:55.479]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:02.360]  Coming up, I've had time the last few days to really analyze this reported sweep of an 11-member Russian sweeper cell.
[00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:27.284]  And the Wall Street Journal and others have headlines like, spying as networking.
[00:08:27.284 --> 00:08:31.508]  And they say, if these are spies, it's a new type of spy.
[00:08:31.508 --> 00:08:34.891]  They didn't try to infiltrate government officials.
[00:08:34.891 --> 00:08:37.874]  They tried to infiltrate major corporations.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.863]  Well, I mean, that's what British intelligence did a hundred years ago on record.
[00:08:43.863 --> 00:08:45.964]  They've written many books about it.
[00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:47.625]  They brag about it.
[00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:53.469]  The British came in and took over New York City socialite society.
[00:08:53.469 --> 00:08:56.971]  They came in and they infiltrated banking.
[00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:59.333]  They came in and set up the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:03.637]  Because in America, the robber barons ran the country.
[00:09:03.637 --> 00:09:06.119]  The corporations had already had a coup d'etat.
[00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:13.184]  And so if you're a foreign intelligence operation, if you can come in and take control of the corporations, you control the country.
[00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:18.368]  That's all the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission is.
[00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:21.110]  Globalism is treason.
[00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.393]  Globalism is a corporate takeover.
[00:09:24.393 --> 00:09:28.075]  Globalism is espionage.
[00:09:28.075 --> 00:09:28.716]  Espionage.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.864]  It is economic sabotage.
[00:09:35.864 --> 00:09:42.351]  They come in, they shut your country down, they only allow businesses to operate through government that they own and control.
[00:09:43.154 --> 00:09:50.218]  They put tax incentives on moving to China, where they've got deals with corrupt Chinese officials who will only let them operate.
[00:09:50.218 --> 00:09:52.499]  Then no one can compete with slave goods.
[00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:58.682]  It consolidates the power of the elite, bankrupts the United States, and then makes us feudal serfs.
[00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:11.188]  I mean, this is the British mercantile slave model they used to control the Caribbean for 400 years, that they used to control Asia for hundreds of years, that they used to take over China.
[00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:17.465]  And when they put Mao in, they just set up the neo-colonial mercantile model.
[00:10:17.465 --> 00:10:20.248]  And this is in all the top economic publications.
[00:10:20.248 --> 00:10:21.529]  This is not hidden.
[00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:25.152]  They know that you are not going to go out and read this information.
[00:10:25.152 --> 00:10:30.056]  So of course the Russians basically had spy networkers.
[00:10:30.056 --> 00:10:33.619]  And I was being sarcastic yesterday when I said, fine, execute the spies.
[00:10:33.619 --> 00:10:34.781]  You know, they don't deserve that.
[00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:36.182]  They deserve to be shipped back to Russia.
[00:10:37.847 --> 00:11:03.030]  The issue here is, I said, if you're going to put them in prison, if you're going to punish them, and which they should be punished, because I'm into America, I'm into sovereignty, I'm into the Bill of Rights and Constitution Declaration of Independence, because it isn't the perfect system, but it's the best system we've ever seen on this planet, and the globalists hate it for a good reason, because it's diametrically opposed to their mercantilism, their neo-colonial feudalism.
[00:11:04.468 --> 00:11:06.009]  And I'm not gonna be part of it.
[00:11:06.009 --> 00:11:16.412]  Mercantilism was a system developed by the French around 400 years ago to manage the burgeoning free market that had developed in the birth of the Renaissance.
[00:11:16.412 --> 00:11:21.374]  And it was a new merchant class that was out-competing the nobles.
[00:11:21.374 --> 00:11:30.797]  And so the nobles came in with a letter-of-mark type government certification from the crown so that they could be given license to be the only ones operating.
[00:11:30.797 --> 00:11:32.138]  And they were given monopolies.
[00:11:33.098 --> 00:11:37.862]  And it was then a political system where they used it to control their colonies and their possessions.
[00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:42.746]  Then it was adopted by the Spanish, the British, and others, for those that don't know.
[00:11:42.746 --> 00:11:49.612]  And an example of mercantilism, one of the biggest reasons we went to war, we're told in 1776, it was over a tiny tea tax.
[00:11:49.612 --> 00:11:54.115]  No, that was, there was a protest against the tea tax.
[00:11:54.115 --> 00:11:55.676]  You know it as the Boston Tea Party.
[00:11:56.687 --> 00:12:04.651]  When the people from the Green Dragon Inn got drunk and went over and threw millions of dollars in today's numbers of tea into the harbor of British tea.
[00:12:04.651 --> 00:12:21.739]  They had their own shipments of tea coming in, so it was mainly economic sabotage of their own, saying, look, you're hurting us, selectively enforcing tea taxes on American importers, colonial importers, and giving preferential treatment to British importers, but I'm gonna digress from that.
[00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.552]  The issue in history is if you know it, you're not doomed to repeat it.
[00:12:27.552 --> 00:12:31.894]  If you know history and then use those lessons to defend yourself.
[00:12:31.894 --> 00:12:35.555]  And you could not manufacture firearms in the United States.
[00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:40.718]  You could not manufacture shovels, pickaxes, buggy whips.
[00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:51.402]  You could not manufacture any finished good that was considered to be factory built.
[00:12:51.402 --> 00:12:52.703]  England had factories.
[00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.311]  And the United States, which was of course the colonies at the time, was not allowed.
[00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:08.634]  We were allowed to produce raw cotton, raw tobacco, raw timber, raw corn, raw wheat, raw maize.
[00:13:08.634 --> 00:13:13.976]  But you weren't allowed to grind it into flour and then ship it abroad.
[00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:15.676]  You can grind it into flour here.
[00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:19.597]  There are all these Byzantine rules and government inspectors.
[00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:21.558]  And see, that's how London
[00:13:22.628 --> 00:13:23.168]  We're good to go.
[00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:44.689]  So, see, globalism, they understand what it means to de-industrialize you.
[00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:45.990]  They weren't stupid.
[00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.871]  Oh, look, globalism failed.
[00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:49.893]  It shut down all our factories.
[00:13:49.893 --> 00:13:52.434]  They knew it would cause a giant sucking sound.
[00:13:52.434 --> 00:13:56.197]  It was designed to do that.
[00:13:56.197 --> 00:14:00.480]  So, they've got these incredibly beautiful Russian women.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.382]  I mean, this redhead looks like a supermodel.
[00:14:03.382 --> 00:14:09.166]  They show her in New York real estate.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.446]  Video interview she did last year and she looks like a movie star.
[00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:20.312]  She could add a career in Hollywood.
[00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:27.121]  Amazing energy and charisma.
[00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:31.548]  On top of the dynamite looks.
[00:14:31.548 --> 00:14:37.791]  And I will tell you right now that it's a 99% chance these are deep cover sleeper cells, exactly as the FBI said.
[00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:39.171]  And the media hadn't told you yet.
[00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:41.513]  These were sex operatives, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:44.454]  And I've seen the news going, this is a new type of spying.
[00:14:44.454 --> 00:14:46.135]  This is not a new type of spying.
[00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.916]  The bumbling Russian spying of the 1940s and 50s.
[00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:58.353]  When for a brief time, late 1940s, early 50s, the U.S., England, and Russia were actually at odds with each other.
[00:14:58.353 --> 00:14:59.494]  That is, England and the U.S.
[00:14:59.494 --> 00:15:00.734]  against Russia.
[00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.335]  Because the globalists put the Russians in.
[00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:03.715]  They put the commies in.
[00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:05.156]  On record, that's now declassified.
[00:15:05.156 --> 00:15:06.296]  They put Mao in.
[00:15:06.296 --> 00:15:08.597]  Declassified public history channel.
[00:15:08.597 --> 00:15:09.737]  CIA admits it.
[00:15:09.737 --> 00:15:11.378]  Totally evil that they admit it.
[00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:13.979]  Just like they admit they're growing the opium in Afghanistan.
[00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:16.900]  They know we're out there exposing it now, so they just say, okay, we admit it.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.760]  Big deal, let's move on.
[00:15:19.517 --> 00:15:22.978]  This is how the British roundtable groups operate.
[00:15:22.978 --> 00:15:27.300]  This is one of their arsenal in their Swiss Army knife is swallows.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.522]  That's the CIA term for a sex operative.
[00:15:32.522 --> 00:15:33.663]  I'll tell you, I've told the story.
[00:15:33.663 --> 00:15:37.164]  I've been in New York before and had a Russian sex operative try to get me in bed.
[00:15:37.164 --> 00:15:38.424]  And I was like, are you kidding?
[00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:39.385]  Number one, I'm married.
[00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:40.245]  No cheat on my wife.
[00:15:40.245 --> 00:15:42.866]  And number two, you're a Russian spy.
[00:15:42.866 --> 00:15:44.287]  So now stop trying to give me drinks.
[00:15:46.172 --> 00:15:48.813]  Was that three years ago in a 9-11 thing?
[00:15:48.813 --> 00:15:49.774]  It was pretty ridiculous.
[00:15:49.774 --> 00:15:52.235]  I mean, and boy, she was just coming on, coming on.
[00:15:52.235 --> 00:15:53.815]  Even had her handler there.
[00:15:53.815 --> 00:15:57.557]  I mean, and I said, well, I mean, what do you think I, who do you think I am?
[00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:00.678]  Nothing will get in the way of my mission against the new world order.
[00:16:00.678 --> 00:16:06.721]  Anyways, so, uh, she wasn't as good looking as this one though.
[00:16:06.721 --> 00:16:07.681]  God don't tempt me.
[00:16:07.681 --> 00:16:13.204]  Uh, I love my wife and she's a very beautiful person, but just keep, keep, keep it away.
[00:16:13.204 --> 00:16:13.304]  Um,
[00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:18.882]  But continuing, oh yeah, I've seen some things in my life, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:20.177 --> 00:16:21.898]  Of course they're Russian spies.
[00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:26.000]  In fact, let me just get into it now, then I'll get into the economy since I started off into this.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.021]  Spying as networking.
[00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:29.222]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:16:29.222 --> 00:16:32.143]  If they were spies, their strategy was unorthodox.
[00:16:32.143 --> 00:16:32.883]  Really?
[00:16:32.883 --> 00:16:34.224]  No, this is British Intel model.
[00:16:34.224 --> 00:16:35.625]  They're getting sophisticated.
[00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:45.710]  Instead of directly infiltrating government agencies, several of the accused Russian spies apparently tried to glean information by moving in financial and elite circles.
[00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.871]  Because there's been a financial coup in America.
[00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:50.240]  Wall Street runs things.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.924]  Of course they were in New York where the criminal bankers are.
[00:16:53.924 --> 00:16:57.707]  I mean, of course!
[00:16:57.707 --> 00:17:00.370]  Who do you think took America over?
[00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.632]  British intel through US intel.
[00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:08.544]  And now the Israelis, of course, are merged with that, because the Rothschilds are some of the most powerful people in England.
[00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:11.085]  It's all one big sickening amalgamation.
[00:17:11.085 --> 00:17:14.268]  Suspect Donald Howard Heathfield.
[00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:18.290]  People had fake names, infiltrated as young people, right out of high school.
[00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.092]  For example, graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
[00:17:21.092 --> 00:17:22.973]  Well, have you looked at who runs America?
[00:17:22.973 --> 00:17:28.997]  Almost every position is a Harvard alumni, and then they go on to Goldman Sachs.
[00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:31.298]  This is a mafia.
[00:17:31.298 --> 00:17:33.420]  It's Harvard, and then Yale, and then Princeton.
[00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:41.988]  You've got financial globalists who are international corporate operators who are sucking every country dry.
[00:17:41.988 --> 00:17:44.070]  Of course the Russians infiltrated Harvard.
[00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.152]  Of course they tried to infiltrate Goldman Sachs.
[00:17:46.152 --> 00:17:50.236]  This is the illegitimate government!
[00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.699]  The Russians aren't going to get anything done with a ceremonial Congress.
[00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:57.243]  The Russians aren't going to get anything done with a ceremonial president.
[00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.084]  You think peanut?
[00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.611]  Or the last guy, Bush?
[00:18:01.611 --> 00:18:03.231]  You think these guys actually run anything?
[00:18:03.231 --> 00:18:04.972]  They read off teleprompters.
[00:18:04.972 --> 00:18:09.733]  Of course they tried to infiltrate Harvard.
[00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:12.314]  Have you looked at who runs this country?
[00:18:12.314 --> 00:18:17.036]  Bunch of crooks, bunch of Ivy League crooks, handled by British intelligence.
[00:18:17.036 --> 00:18:21.517]  God save the Queen and all that.
[00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.978]  If they were spies, their strategy was unorthodox.
[00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:26.739]  Who do you think we fought a war against to get this country?
[00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:32.692]  What in France and your people that have the freedom fries you like to make fun of on your menus?
[00:18:32.692 --> 00:18:34.992]  They're the reason we got the country!
[00:18:34.992 --> 00:18:40.294]  See, everything we've been given is a, is a Anglo-centric, Anglophile religion.
[00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:42.115]  All the French bashing.
[00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:45.156]  I notice old, old movies in the 30s with French bashing.
[00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:48.097]  It's because British Intel took this country over.
[00:18:48.097 --> 00:18:49.437]  Doesn't mean the British people.
[00:18:49.437 --> 00:18:50.758]  They've been taken over by the same system.
[00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:54.877]  If they were spies, their strategy was unorthodox.
[00:18:54.877 --> 00:18:58.938]  Oh, you mean like the British taking over Yale in 1832 on record?
[00:18:58.938 --> 00:18:59.778]  Their skull and bones?
[00:18:59.778 --> 00:19:03.339]  You mean that unorthodox operation?
[00:19:03.339 --> 00:19:06.460]  If they were spies, their strategy was unorthodox, British intel.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:13.842]  Instead of directly infiltrating government agencies, several of the accused Russian spies apparently tried to glean information by moving into financial and elite circles.
[00:19:13.842 --> 00:19:14.962]  Because they run this country.
[00:19:16.431 --> 00:19:27.319]  Suspect Donald Howard Heathfield, for example, graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and was an energetic networker who promoted his consultancy firm, FutureMap, aimed at governments and businesses.
[00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:29.681]  Former classmates recall, what did the NSA do?
[00:19:29.681 --> 00:19:32.603]  They started Google to go around getting everybody's info.
[00:19:32.603 --> 00:19:37.846]  And then it's private, so the bankers control it.
[00:19:37.846 --> 00:19:40.648]  That's what globalism is.
[00:19:40.648 --> 00:19:42.430]  Globalism equals treason.
[00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:48.222]  Globalism equals foreign offshore corporate governance.
[00:19:48.222 --> 00:19:50.303]  I mean, have you seen the G20?
[00:19:50.303 --> 00:19:56.348]  No matter if it's England, Canada, or the U.S., it's the exact same procedures, exact same black vans snatching people.
[00:19:56.348 --> 00:19:57.729]  It's all run by the banks.
[00:19:57.729 --> 00:19:58.589]  They call the shots.
[00:19:58.589 --> 00:19:59.250]  They've taken over.
[00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:09.681]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:13.244]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[00:20:13.244 --> 00:20:22.830]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:28.094]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.

[00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:01.367]  Gold.
[00:21:01.367 --> 00:21:02.888]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:02.888 --> 00:21:09.170]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.991]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.351 --> 00:21:15.292]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:17.713]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:17.713 --> 00:21:25.817]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[00:22:04.443 --> 00:22:05.684]  Tyranny is here.
[00:22:05.684 --> 00:22:09.448]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:09.448 --> 00:22:12.030]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:17.735]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:22:17.735 --> 00:22:23.981]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:30.342]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:30.342 --> 00:22:34.543]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening death to which our republic has fallen.
[00:22:34.543 --> 00:22:38.844]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:38.844 --> 00:22:44.785]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:44.785 --> 00:22:48.345]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:48.345 --> 00:22:50.306]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:50.746]  It's here.

[00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:11.370]  I am a defender of the Republic.
[00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.011]  I am an American.
[00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:15.532]  I am born on the 4th of July.
[00:24:15.532 --> 00:24:19.673]  And I will defend this country against Republican neocon scum.
[00:24:19.673 --> 00:24:22.074]  I will defend it against left-wing communist filth.
[00:24:22.074 --> 00:24:27.276]  And I will defend it against the international bankers that fund and run the entire operation.
[00:24:27.276 --> 00:24:31.718]  And I will defend it against the entire New World Order system and their stinking agenda.
[00:24:31.718 --> 00:24:33.619]  I want my Republic back.
[00:24:34.893 --> 00:24:36.755]  I want my republic back.
[00:24:36.755 --> 00:24:38.857]  I want my private property rights back.

[00:24:42.582 --> 00:24:44.684]  I mean, look at how ignorant the Wall Street Journal is.
[00:24:44.684 --> 00:24:49.009]  Either these three writers that wrote this story are morons, or they're giving you disinfo.
[00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:51.011]  And I've got to believe it's disinfo.
[00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:55.476]  I mean, the gentleman that wrote the James Bond novels,
[00:24:58.444 --> 00:25:09.138]  He was a member of OSS, and then MI6, and in all the movies which have reality woven in, all James Bond is doing is seducing women spies to have sex with him.
[00:25:09.138 --> 00:25:10.760]  They're trying to seduce him.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.264]  People are filming it covertly through glass mirrors.
[00:25:14.264 --> 00:25:15.646]  That's exactly what goes on.
[00:25:17.168 --> 00:25:22.410]  They're wondering, oh, in the newspaper, this is never heard of, sex operatives.
[00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.631]  Oh, jeepers.
[00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:24.892]  We never heard of that.
[00:25:24.892 --> 00:25:33.616]  And then other people are running around saying that they were journalists and they just were illegal aliens who had fake deep cover fake marriages to be reporters.
[00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:35.577]  I mean, that's even more asinine.
[00:25:36.317 --> 00:25:38.598]  If you believe that, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:25:38.598 --> 00:25:46.862]  But again, hyperventilating, and they've got former KGB operatives who will just sell out to whoever officer, you know, money.
[00:25:46.862 --> 00:25:52.445]  You know, now CIA disinfo people all over radio and TV going, the Russians are gonna get us.
[00:25:52.445 --> 00:25:54.265]  The Russians are everywhere.
[00:25:54.265 --> 00:25:58.988]  Oh my gosh, there's Russian spies all over the place.
[00:25:58.988 --> 00:26:03.790]  Ladies and gentlemen, what there are are corporate spies all over the place, and they already run the government.
[00:26:05.017 --> 00:26:08.799]  Have you read an SPP document?
[00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:13.041]  Again, Judicial Watch sued and got them, and I talk about it all the time because it's so incredible.
[00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:18.183]  You look at the meeting at Baylor in 2005, the meetings in Mexico in 2006, the meetings in 2007 in Banff, Canada, subsequent documents in 2008, 2009, and 2010.
[00:26:26.997 --> 00:26:47.772]  And they arrive at these armored complexes with troops outside guarding them, costing hundreds of millions, if not billions, like in the case of the G20, and the world leaders sit down, and then they have a corporate governance board, and they break into subgroups, and the corporate leaders come and tell the government what they voted on, and then the government says, yes, sir, in the meetings.
[00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:52.516]  Government officials say, in the minutes, yes, sir, and then they go and implement it.
[00:26:52.516 --> 00:26:53.536]  And now, is that treason?
[00:26:54.557 --> 00:26:56.438]  Is that a coup d'etat?
[00:26:56.438 --> 00:26:57.378]  Is that a takeover?
[00:26:57.378 --> 00:26:58.378]  Of course it is!
[00:26:58.378 --> 00:27:02.760]  So of course the Russians are trying to infiltrate the corporations.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.061]  Of course they're infiltrating Harvard, where they train the traitors.
[00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:12.963]  What about some of the Harvard PhDs we've had on?
[00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:21.334]  Like Dr. Francis Boyle, Ph.D., international lawyer, wrote the U.S.
[00:27:21.334 --> 00:27:24.056]  Biological Weapons Treaty for the U.N.
[00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:33.563]  He'll tell you he was sent and trained, because he was top of his class, to be in the one office of Henry Kissinger, where they give out one Ph.D.
[00:27:33.563 --> 00:27:40.148]  a year, and it was given to him to carry out world government, extermination, genocide, total takeover, British intel.
[00:27:40.148 --> 00:27:40.629]  He'll tell you!
[00:27:41.753 --> 00:27:51.678]  One person a year and he went and was given that position and was given the full plan and said, I'm not going to be part of this.
[00:27:51.678 --> 00:27:57.300]  That's a powerful defector from the enemy camp to us, isn't it?
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.961]  And he's of course in fall the Republic.
[00:28:00.404 --> 00:28:02.846]  But we need defectors from Goldman Sachs.
[00:28:02.846 --> 00:28:06.649]  We need defectors from the private Federal Reserve.
[00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:08.971]  We need defectors from BP.
[00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:11.153]  That's where you get real defectors from.
[00:28:11.153 --> 00:28:22.382]  You don't get it from Russia, surrounded, imploded, on all sides with the bankers trying to get back in and loot, because the old line Russian elite are actually able to run that country.
[00:28:22.382 --> 00:28:25.165]  And they're looting, but nothing like the bankers would do.
[00:28:25.725 --> 00:28:28.632]  Because the bankers want to run countries into the ground.
[00:28:28.632 --> 00:28:33.103]  The Russian elite want to use Russia as a command base for their own power and control.
[00:28:33.103 --> 00:28:35.188]  And they do have some Russian patriotism.
[00:28:36.274 --> 00:28:39.976]  But they're still very corrupt, from my analysis.
[00:28:39.976 --> 00:29:00.930]  But compared to the Goldman Sachs, compared to the British Intel elite, compared to the corporate Genovese mafia, black nobility, the merger of the Italian royal families with the German royal families and the British royal families, merged with the Rothschilds, the most cunning people you can imagine, has created the ultimate symbiosis
[00:29:01.871 --> 00:29:03.838]  Of what we now live under.
[00:29:03.838 --> 00:29:06.869]  And they are as ruthless as anything you can imagine.
[00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:10.633]  Let me tell you how many levels the British Intel plays.
[00:29:10.633 --> 00:29:15.135]  You can read the documents from 1830s, 1870s.
[00:29:15.135 --> 00:29:17.116]  You can read their battle plans from 1919.
[00:29:17.116 --> 00:29:23.339]  The Milner Group saying, we're going to let Germany build back up after incredible sanctions.
[00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:25.760]  They will then elect a war leader.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.721]  We'll fund him as a dictator.
[00:29:27.721 --> 00:29:33.383]  We'll encourage the dictator to go wild, claim we're going to team up with him, and then we'll bring him down and wreck Europe.
[00:29:33.383 --> 00:29:34.724]  And that way, I mean,
[00:29:35.544 --> 00:29:39.085]  How do you deal with people playing in 25-year increments?
[00:29:39.085 --> 00:29:42.367]  As Brzezinski brags, they do.
[00:29:42.367 --> 00:29:46.408]  Well, you study their battle plans and ask yourself if you want to be enslaved by these people.
[00:29:46.408 --> 00:29:48.969]  Because their endgame is killing you and your family.
[00:29:48.969 --> 00:29:50.570]  They want you dead.
[00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.971]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.971 --> 00:29:54.492]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:57.173]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.094 --> 00:30:01.736]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:30:21.415 --> 00:30:24.057]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:30:24.057 --> 00:30:30.584]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:30:30.584 --> 00:30:33.526]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support InfoWars.

[00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:37.130]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[00:30:40.413 --> 00:30:48.338]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W Dirtback.
[00:30:48.338 --> 00:30:52.140]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:52.660]  Thank you!
[00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.173]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:31:02.173 --> 00:31:04.496]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:07.720]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.827]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:31:12.827 --> 00:31:17.013]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:19.654]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:31:19.654 --> 00:31:22.555]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:31:22.555 --> 00:31:25.457]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:31:25.457 --> 00:31:33.060]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:31:33.399 --> 00:31:38.682]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:31:38.682 --> 00:31:41.644]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:31:41.644 --> 00:31:45.326]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:31:45.326 --> 00:31:46.407]  And I got news for you.
[00:31:46.407 --> 00:31:47.728]  You're everyone else.
[00:31:47.728 --> 00:31:49.249]  Invisible Empire.

[00:32:00.302 --> 00:32:03.326]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.326 --> 00:32:08.652]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:08.652 --> 00:32:10.715]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:10.715 --> 00:32:15.721]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:16.903]  How much do you want?
[00:32:16.903 --> 00:32:17.624]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.004 --> 00:32:19.884]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:19.884 --> 00:32:20.965]  When will you need it?
[00:32:20.965 --> 00:32:23.165]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.165 --> 00:32:24.486]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.486 --> 00:32:26.026]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.026 --> 00:32:31.287]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.287 --> 00:32:34.868]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:34.868 --> 00:32:38.349]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:39.930]  How much will you need?
[00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:40.831]  We don't know.
[00:32:40.831 --> 00:32:41.932]  How much do you want?
[00:32:41.932 --> 00:32:42.853]  All you can get.
[00:32:42.853 --> 00:32:43.954]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:43.954 --> 00:32:47.016]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.016 --> 00:32:48.798]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:48.798 --> 00:32:49.698]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:05.575 --> 00:33:07.957]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:07.957 --> 00:33:12.500]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:22.947]  I haven't said much about the Al Gore situation, but watching his body language and the way he's been behaving, and he always looked like a big fat degenerate rapist to me.
[00:33:22.947 --> 00:33:27.470]  A lot of times the book cover matches what's inside, sometimes it doesn't.
[00:33:29.955 --> 00:33:40.261]  This could be some type of bizarre false flag where she later comes out and admits it's all a fraud as some way to discredit anybody who ever comes out against Gore.
[00:33:40.261 --> 00:33:46.605]  But I don't think that's the case because this is something that's dirty either way you slice it.
[00:33:46.605 --> 00:33:52.709]  So we will cover that coming up.
[00:33:52.709 --> 00:33:57.292]  Accuser claims key witnesses, hotel video surveillance, DNA evidence,
[00:33:58.325 --> 00:34:03.406]  Gore unequivocally and emphatically denies, kind of like Bill Clinton.
[00:34:03.406 --> 00:34:06.387]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:34:06.387 --> 00:34:09.488]  And then he shook his finger and said, how dare you?
[00:34:09.488 --> 00:34:12.548]  How dare you say I did?
[00:34:12.548 --> 00:34:16.309]  It's a complete lie.
[00:34:16.309 --> 00:34:18.250]  And see, these guys like to force it on somebody.
[00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.410]  He got even more excited, reportedly, as she said no.
[00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:23.991]  And then she was trying to get out and he ran over and started hunching on her.
[00:34:26.229 --> 00:34:28.632]  I want to warn you, though, we're not going to air all of this tape.
[00:34:28.632 --> 00:34:30.014]  We bleeped out the cuss words.
[00:34:30.014 --> 00:34:31.956]  We're going to fade them down.
[00:34:31.956 --> 00:34:38.323]  But still, it is graphic, so if there's any children listening, I'm going to play a short clip of this now, but I'm going to play more of it next hour.
[00:34:38.323 --> 00:34:41.367]  Here's just a short clip of when it started.
[00:34:41.367 --> 00:34:46.373]  He grabbed my right hand hard, shoved it down under the sheet.
[00:34:48.075 --> 00:34:48.396]  I don't know.
[00:35:01.055 --> 00:35:03.998]  This is all happening really fast, as you can imagine.
[00:35:03.998 --> 00:35:04.719]  That's enough.
[00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:05.980]  That's the police deposition.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.142]  They've reopened the criminal investigation.
[00:35:08.142 --> 00:35:17.732]  See, when this happened three years ago, he was at the height of his Nobel Prize and the worship and people were literally saying he laid golden eggs when he went to the bathroom.
[00:35:17.732 --> 00:35:20.054]  That, I mean, this guy could do nothing wrong.
[00:35:20.655 --> 00:35:28.526]  He was like the Second Coming of Christ, all rolled into one, and an Easter Bunny, and the Golden Goose.
[00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:30.108]  I mean, he was like God.
[00:35:30.108 --> 00:35:31.950]  He was a saint.
[00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.353]  And really, he was a big man bear pig.
[00:35:35.543 --> 00:35:38.525]  He was the guy that sold you that NAFTA and GATT was going to be great.
[00:35:38.525 --> 00:35:41.667]  This is a good deal, Larry.
[00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:43.569]  We cover that in Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:43.569 --> 00:35:48.672]  This deal is going to really build new factories in the United States, Larry.
[00:35:48.672 --> 00:35:49.753]  Shut up, Ross.
[00:35:49.753 --> 00:35:51.875]  This is my time to speak.
[00:35:51.875 --> 00:35:56.418]  Let me speak in my big fake Southern Nelly accent here for you.
[00:36:03.371 --> 00:36:06.672]  Was Naftan Gadd a good deal for you, America?
[00:36:06.672 --> 00:36:09.754]  Did Bill Clinton not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky?
[00:36:09.754 --> 00:36:12.495]  Do they not lie?
[00:36:12.495 --> 00:36:15.316]  And notice how he was real quiet about this in 2006.
[00:36:15.316 --> 00:36:19.338]  It came out then, when it first happened, I guess four years ago.
[00:36:19.338 --> 00:36:22.959]  And then he was real quiet the last two weeks about it.
[00:36:22.959 --> 00:36:25.040]  That's suspicious, even though it was big news.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.942]  And now he's had to deny... But notice he doesn't say in
[00:36:30.362 --> 00:36:33.803]  Words like, no, she's a liar, because he didn't want to encourage her to get more angry.
[00:36:33.803 --> 00:36:37.743]  He doesn't say, she's scum, she wanted money, she's a fraud, she's a criminal.
[00:36:37.743 --> 00:36:40.144]  He says, I unequivocally and emphatically deny.
[00:36:40.144 --> 00:36:44.245]  Because he knows the general public doesn't even know what unequivocally or emphatically means.
[00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:54.387]  When they use a lawyer term like that, a long word, that's what he later could say, I did touch her, but she touched me, and I mean unequivocally and emphatically deny that I tried to force her.
[00:36:54.387 --> 00:36:55.847]  Why do you think his wife's leaving him?
[00:36:58.439 --> 00:36:59.380]  All right, I'm already getting into this.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.921]  I said I'd get into it next hour.
[00:37:00.921 --> 00:37:02.062]  I got the financial news.
[00:37:02.062 --> 00:37:03.363]  It's the top story.
[00:37:03.363 --> 00:37:07.006]  The Iran situation, the latest on the oil spill.
[00:37:07.006 --> 00:37:09.108]  What happened with Charlie Veach?
[00:37:09.108 --> 00:37:11.991]  He emailed us and he said, look, I'll come on if you want.
[00:37:11.991 --> 00:37:13.992]  The fellow arrested twice in Toronto.
[00:37:16.786 --> 00:37:18.487]  But he said, I want to get out of Canada first.
[00:37:18.487 --> 00:37:21.368]  And I said, yeah, let's just not have you on until you get back to England.
[00:37:21.368 --> 00:37:21.748]  You know why?
[00:37:21.748 --> 00:37:33.952]  Because when they screamed at me for 15 hours and threatened to set me up and put me in prison when I was there over Bilderberg in 2006 in Ottawa, this was in Toronto, about 50 miles away.
[00:37:33.952 --> 00:37:41.095]  When the media found out I was there and showed up, they went from screaming and cussing and saying I was going to go to a Toronto prison and all the rest of it.
[00:37:41.095 --> 00:37:44.316]  And trying to get me to say I was basically a terrorist.
[00:37:46.243 --> 00:37:49.885]  And trying to get my guys to say that they were terrorists and I was a terrorist.
[00:37:49.885 --> 00:37:53.407]  Then they got scared and the head guy came in and he said, I have daughters.
[00:37:53.407 --> 00:37:54.668]  He started starting to cry a little.
[00:37:54.668 --> 00:37:57.289]  He said, please, please don't talk bad about me.
[00:37:57.289 --> 00:38:02.052]  And then I said, uh, well, you know what, buddy, I just want to be able to cover this.
[00:38:02.052 --> 00:38:05.414]  And he said, and he shifted into, you know, good cop, bad cop.
[00:38:05.414 --> 00:38:06.114]  He went back into bad cop.
[00:38:06.114 --> 00:38:10.657]  He said, you'll have to leave, you know, and we've got people outside the police force and you don't know what could happen.
[00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.312]  And then I realized, oh, this guy's really dangerous.
[00:38:15.312 --> 00:38:24.198]  And so, um, I said, well, I'll try to go easy on you.
[00:38:24.198 --> 00:38:27.100]  And they started crying again and it was all fake.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.882]  And these people are lunatics.
[00:38:28.882 --> 00:38:33.645]  I mean, this bully, uh, acted real tough, uh, until, um,
[00:38:35.919 --> 00:38:38.182]  Until the media got there and then he just went to pieces.
[00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:44.711]  So I would imagine they were telling him, you gotta come back in August for your court date even though you're pleading not guilty.
[00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:47.394]  And you better watch it, things can happen boy!
[00:38:49.011 --> 00:38:51.952]  And so I don't see how he can even talk once he gets to England.
[00:38:51.952 --> 00:38:58.034]  In my experience, if he goes along with them and licks their boots, they're gonna probably set him up even worse once he gets there.
[00:38:58.034 --> 00:39:00.435]  They're like, good, we got him where we want him.
[00:39:00.435 --> 00:39:02.015]  Let's throw the book at him.
[00:39:02.015 --> 00:39:04.356]  I mean, Charlie, buddy, they'll plant drugs on you.
[00:39:04.356 --> 00:39:06.337]  There's no end to these people.
[00:39:06.337 --> 00:39:15.220]  You've got all the reports coming out now by women that they threatened to rape them and during the quote enhanced strip search, men did penetrate them with their fingers.
[00:39:18.183 --> 00:39:24.307]  So, oh, and the police didn't rape that fellow with a plunger for two hours either with blood pouring out.
[00:39:24.307 --> 00:39:24.827]  They did.
[00:39:24.827 --> 00:39:27.088]  A good cop finally blew the whistle.
[00:39:27.088 --> 00:39:30.130]  Of course, cops would say he was the bad cop.
[00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.452]  Who would want to rape somebody for two hours with a plunger?
[00:39:33.452 --> 00:39:36.994]  I mean, even if you were a sadistic rapist, that would get kind of old, wouldn't it?
[00:39:36.994 --> 00:39:38.935]  But not to a demon.
[00:39:38.935 --> 00:39:40.816]  Two hours.
[00:39:40.816 --> 00:39:42.417]  Raping with a toilet plunger.
[00:39:42.417 --> 00:39:45.959]  I mean, I want to support the police.
[00:39:47.225 --> 00:39:51.087]  I want to, but I mean, come on.
[00:39:51.087 --> 00:39:51.947]  Come on.
[00:39:51.947 --> 00:39:53.328]  All right, now I'm digressing again.
[00:39:53.328 --> 00:40:05.553]  And I want to finish up on the Russian spy situation and really make it clear how this is a great illustration of how the media hyperventilates over a threat.
[00:40:05.553 --> 00:40:08.434]  Yeah, it's like one fire ant biting you versus 1,000.
[00:40:08.434 --> 00:40:09.974]  One fire ant can't kill you, 1,000 can.
[00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:13.436]  Let me tell you something, we got 1,000 Goldman Sachs fire ants on us.
[00:40:14.346 --> 00:40:16.767]  And we got one Russian ant on us.
[00:40:16.767 --> 00:40:20.569]  And the crazy lunatic Goldman Sachs ants want to have a war with Russia.
[00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:24.211]  They're so full of chutzpah that they want to do that.
[00:40:24.211 --> 00:40:27.653]  And we have got to stop it.
[00:40:27.653 --> 00:40:30.434]  We have got to stop it.
[00:40:30.434 --> 00:40:31.655]  I'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:40:31.655 --> 00:40:33.516]  Before I go any further here today,
[00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.792]  I want to tell you about a few of the fabulous sponsors that made this transmission possible.
[00:40:38.792 --> 00:40:40.274]  One of them is the Ecolablue.

[00:40:42.195 --> 00:40:43.376]  May right out of the air you breathe?
[00:40:43.376 --> 00:40:45.577]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[00:40:45.577 --> 00:40:51.201]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue, with the Ecolablue 28 and the brand new Ecolablue 30 machines, will allow you to do just that.

[00:41:22.398 --> 00:41:24.820]  Big old banner up there at the top of the site.
[00:41:33.362 --> 00:41:36.203]  Also, I want to tell you about Weapons Universe.
[00:41:36.203 --> 00:41:37.744]  Weapons Universe.
[00:41:37.744 --> 00:41:43.146]  And that's another one of the great sites of Blade Empire.
[00:41:43.146 --> 00:41:50.790]  But weapons-universe.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:53.091]  They are just a wonderful sponsor.
[00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:59.359]  And these folks have everything you can imagine for your self-defense needs.
[00:41:59.359 --> 00:42:04.060]  Everything you need, go to weapons-universe.com.

[00:42:17.303 --> 00:42:19.364]  And they're patriots, weapons-universe.com.
[00:42:21.363 --> 00:42:25.205]  And they've got stun guns, they've got tasers, they've just got everything.
[00:42:25.205 --> 00:42:27.427]  They've got mace, they've got pepper spray.
[00:42:27.427 --> 00:42:29.087]  Weapons-universe.com.
[00:42:29.087 --> 00:42:32.950]  That's weapons-universe.com.
[00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.191]  Get them before Kagan comes after you.
[00:42:35.191 --> 00:42:37.192]  We're not joking around about that witch.
[00:42:37.192 --> 00:42:47.078]  Yesterday they asked her, I'm gonna play this later too, they asked her whether she liked werewolves or vampires in the new movie Twilight.
[00:42:48.854 --> 00:42:53.818]  That's the type of softball moron comments that they ask the Penguin.
[00:42:53.818 --> 00:42:54.418]  Because I'm wrong.
[00:42:54.418 --> 00:42:55.739]  She doesn't look like John Wayne Gacy.
[00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:58.201]  She looks like the Penguin.
[00:42:58.201 --> 00:43:00.023]  Have you seen Danny DeVito as the Penguin?
[00:43:00.023 --> 00:43:11.031]  We had an Alex Jones Channel video that Dave put up and he found an image of the Penguin from the 1990s Batman film with Danny DeVito.
[00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:12.132]  And I'm not kidding.
[00:43:12.132 --> 00:43:13.733]  It is her.
[00:43:13.733 --> 00:43:16.135]  She would not even need makeup to play the part of the Penguin.
[00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:17.516]  And I shouldn't attack her for how she looks.
[00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:30.292]  Why do we have to have a... I mean, look, it doesn't really bother me that there'll be no Protestants, even though that's the biggest religion in the United States, on them, even though I'm a Protestant.
[00:43:30.292 --> 00:43:35.777]  I mean, in the politically correct world, it's not the content of your mind or your deeds, it's what group you're part of.
[00:43:35.777 --> 00:43:39.140]  So why isn't the court half Protestant?
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:45.245]  Now, you can find lots of black guys that are Protestant, you know, so you can get that quoted down, have some black guys, have some Protestants, but no.
[00:43:46.909 --> 00:43:54.254]  And I don't even get upset that he'll have, you know, two Jews on the court and no Protestants.
[00:43:54.254 --> 00:43:58.677]  If she was pro-Second Amendment and pro-property rights and not an admitted socialist, that wouldn't be a problem.
[00:43:58.677 --> 00:44:04.461]  But will the whole court end up being hunchbacked lesbians?
[00:44:06.078 --> 00:44:13.281]  I mean, you know, Sotomayor and Kagan, I mean, again, I don't even dislike lesbians.
[00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:15.322]  I don't hate people for what they're into.
[00:44:15.322 --> 00:44:17.003]  I don't, I mean, but I mean, come on.
[00:44:17.003 --> 00:44:23.325]  I mean, is America to be, I mean, what's going on with the head of Homeland Security?
[00:44:23.325 --> 00:44:25.226]  What was going on with Janet Reno?
[00:44:25.226 --> 00:44:27.147]  Janet Reno was in a
[00:44:28.464 --> 00:44:52.358]  Court case and it came out in the Miami and other papers that she was constantly being caught with underage girls and once in the back of a Convertible and that she'd vomited all over the 13 year old girl that she checked out of the CPS I mean that's that's on record that Reno was doing stuff like this and they said my gosh this woman's completely compromised Let's make her because she was controlled by the mafia in Miami and surrounding areas.
[00:44:52.358 --> 00:44:57.061]  Let's make her this corrupt DA Let's make her the Attorney General
[00:44:58.908 --> 00:45:03.693]  And see, let's get it out in the open, Kagan's sexual persuasion.
[00:45:03.693 --> 00:45:06.095]  Let's get Reno's out in the open.
[00:45:06.095 --> 00:45:08.477]  Let's get Sotomayor's out in the open.
[00:45:08.477 --> 00:45:14.603]  See, but they don't want it out in the open because once it's out in the open, they can't blackmail them with it.
[00:45:14.603 --> 00:45:16.505]  It's not that she's a lesbian.
[00:45:16.505 --> 00:45:17.846]  It's not that Sotomayor is.
[00:45:17.846 --> 00:45:20.328]  It's not that Janet Reno was.
[00:45:20.328 --> 00:45:24.032]  The reason they put these women
[00:45:26.388 --> 00:45:29.831]  In there is because they can destroy them anytime they want.
[00:45:29.831 --> 00:45:31.733]  Remember Senator Lindsey Graham?
[00:45:31.733 --> 00:45:40.942]  The head of Alipac comes out and says it's it's well known in Washington that this guy is is part of the Republican gay coalition.
[00:45:40.942 --> 00:45:43.504]  I mean that literally is probably more than half the Republican congressman.
[00:45:43.504 --> 00:45:44.405]  It's unbelievable.
[00:45:44.565 --> 00:45:47.266]  I mean, how many have been caught in bathrooms and running around?
[00:45:47.266 --> 00:45:50.968]  And how many deputy heads of Homeland Security trying to get in bed with little kids?
[00:45:50.968 --> 00:45:59.512]  And I mean, it just goes, I mean, Barney Frank was caught in the late 80s running an underage brothel out of his house, out of his townhouse, and didn't get in trouble.
[00:45:59.512 --> 00:46:04.194]  Because he went and gave a press conference and said, you drop this right now or I'm blowing the whistle on everybody.
[00:46:04.194 --> 00:46:04.814]  And they dropped it.
[00:46:06.078 --> 00:46:08.820]  So, you know, I mean, if Frank is gay, that's his own issue.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.781]  I don't dislike him for that.
[00:46:09.781 --> 00:46:11.682]  I mean, that's his right.
[00:46:11.682 --> 00:46:15.665]  But he does have underage teenagers in there.
[00:46:15.665 --> 00:46:17.446]  He needs to get in trouble for that.
[00:46:17.446 --> 00:46:19.408]  But see, if he goes down, they all go down.
[00:46:19.408 --> 00:46:22.049]  And he's the rare Democrat who's gay, I guess.
[00:46:22.049 --> 00:46:27.633]  The issue here, I mean, look at Gore going after women over here, but it's bad.
[00:46:27.633 --> 00:46:32.437]  Whether he was trying to force it on a male masseuse or a female masseuse, you know, it's wrong.
[00:46:36.718 --> 00:46:46.921]  But you notice, as soon as it came out that Lindsey Graham was being blackmailed for his homosexuality, it must have felt really good to him to be able to not have it over his head, and now he can be re-elected.
[00:46:46.921 --> 00:46:53.504]  He came out and said, I'm against cap and trade, I'm against amnesty, I'm against all the things I was for.
[00:46:53.504 --> 00:46:58.745]  That weight must have felt really good off his shoulders, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:58.745 --> 00:47:00.566]  That weight must have felt really good for him.
[00:47:00.566 --> 00:47:06.068]  Well, that weight is on Kagan, it's on Sotomayor, it's on all these single women.
[00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.311]  I mean, you can go search engine.
[00:47:08.311 --> 00:47:10.594]  In fact, search engine, I didn't cover this a month ago.
[00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:10.914]  I should have.
[00:47:10.914 --> 00:47:21.344]  You can find her at parties, at bar parties with, you know, beautiful women and, you know, smiling like a guy would smile if he was with a beauty queen.
[00:47:21.344 --> 00:47:26.489]  You know, I mean, if I was with Miss Oklahoma, say, at an event and I put my arm, she put her arm around me, I'd probably blush.
[00:47:27.418 --> 00:47:32.261]  Well, you know, it's Kagan blushing with some beautiful, you know, lipstick-type person.
[00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:34.942]  And, uh, you know, she's a bull-you-know-what person.
[00:47:34.942 --> 00:47:36.463]  And, you know, that's what she likes.
[00:47:36.463 --> 00:47:38.044]  I mean, look, she wants to wear pants.
[00:47:38.044 --> 00:47:41.105]  You know, she wouldn't ever wear makeup and earrings and stuff.
[00:47:41.105 --> 00:47:42.106]  I mean, she's a tomboy.
[00:47:42.106 --> 00:47:44.087]  That's... that's her issue.
[00:47:44.087 --> 00:47:45.167]  She likes women.
[00:47:45.167 --> 00:47:46.968]  I like women.
[00:47:46.968 --> 00:47:50.330]  I mean, I'm not... I think the gay lifestyle is destructive.
[00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:51.370]  I think it's bad.
[00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.672]  I... I... But I don't judge these people or hate them.
[00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:57.614]  But the issue is she's being blackmailed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:57.614 --> 00:47:58.415]  You better believe it.
[00:47:58.415 --> 00:48:05.525]  You better believe that I trust Wayne Matz and other investigative reporters and they say the word is Barack Obama is a bisexual.
[00:48:05.525 --> 00:48:07.588]  And they are blackmailing him with that.
[00:48:08.783 --> 00:48:11.444]  This is how they control people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:11.444 --> 00:48:22.088]  And we can't have Presidents, and we can't have Supreme Court Justices, and Heads of Homeland Security, and Heads of Justice Departments, who are homosexual and are being blackmailed.
[00:48:22.088 --> 00:48:34.814]  So Kagan, come out of the closet, admit you're a lesbian, admit that that was what you advocated for, and that was the group that you constantly wrote about, and what you were obsessed with when you were in the White House, and when you were Solicitor General.
[00:48:34.814 --> 00:48:37.495]  Admit that you are a homosexual activist,
[00:48:38.556 --> 00:48:44.360]  Admit that that's your entire life, and I'll have a lot of respect for you.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.322]  Okay, but see, you're not gonna do it.
[00:48:46.322 --> 00:48:50.785]  So I'm gonna say today on air what nobody else will say, okay?
[00:48:50.785 --> 00:48:55.848]  The Supreme Court will become 100% bull dykes if we don't do something about this.
[00:48:55.848 --> 00:48:58.070]  I'm sick of it, okay?
[00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:58.731]  And that woman
[00:48:59.932 --> 00:49:05.880]  That woman wants our guns, and she wants our private property, and she wants everything.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.525]  And she doesn't like families, and she doesn't like heterosexuals.
[00:49:09.525 --> 00:49:11.787]  And she's shown that as part of her record.
[00:49:11.787 --> 00:49:13.430]  And I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.052]  Is that understood?
[00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:17.815]  I'm not going along with it anymore.
[00:49:17.815 --> 00:49:18.096]  Okay?
[00:49:20.436 --> 00:49:22.898]  And that's the term that these gay groups use for each other.
[00:49:22.898 --> 00:49:27.282]  I was watching some group at a protest that got beat up at the G20 and it was wrong.
[00:49:27.282 --> 00:49:30.204]  You know, they call themselves the queers.
[00:49:30.204 --> 00:49:32.907]  And then they can call themselves that but nobody else is supposed to.
[00:49:32.907 --> 00:49:38.451]  I mean, those are the terms they use for themselves on their social networking sites and everywhere else.
[00:49:38.451 --> 00:49:41.093]  And so, I'll call it what it is.
[00:49:41.093 --> 00:49:41.334]  Okay?
[00:49:42.731 --> 00:49:46.774]  And I'm tired of the CPS hunting heterosexual families.
[00:49:46.774 --> 00:49:57.022]  Now on record, now even mainstream news in England, London Telegraph, top reporters, that they go to heterosexual families and take their children to give them to the families of gays and lesbians.
[00:49:57.022 --> 00:49:58.203]  Stop hunting us!
[00:49:59.653 --> 00:50:07.258]  Again, I'm not against these people, but I'm against the aberrant extreme groups out there that are hunting, that are hunting heterosexuals.
[00:50:07.258 --> 00:50:14.923]  It's like Planet of the Apes, and I'm being hunted, and I've had enough, and your political correctness doesn't work on me anymore.
[00:50:14.923 --> 00:50:20.768]  So I've been clear about it now, and I've committed the great cardinal sin of talking bad about Kagan.
[00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:26.351]  And the question to the Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, was, are you a vampire, or are you a werewolf?
[00:50:26.351 --> 00:50:26.952]  And she's neither.
[00:50:27.947 --> 00:50:31.030]  What she is, is a clone of Janet Reno.
[00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:32.991]  And that's why she's in there.
[00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:35.113]  I mean, these women are all look-alikes.
[00:50:35.113 --> 00:50:41.158]  Napolitano, Kagan, Sotomayor, Janet Reno.
[00:50:42.782 --> 00:50:48.007]  And we're so paralyzed by political correctness, we're missing the forest for the trees here.
[00:50:48.007 --> 00:50:58.256]  It isn't that they're lesbians, it's that they're compromised, and they're being blackmailed, and they're forming a power cult, just like Rome founded these cults.
[00:51:01.209 --> 00:51:05.830]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:13.612]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.

[00:52:00.629 --> 00:52:05.593]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.593 --> 00:52:06.593]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.593 --> 00:52:09.035]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.035 --> 00:52:10.056]  A republic.
[00:52:10.056 --> 00:52:12.698]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.698 --> 00:52:14.960]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.981]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.981 --> 00:52:18.662]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.662 --> 00:52:19.983]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:19.983 --> 00:52:20.584]  Children?
[00:52:20.584 --> 00:52:21.725]  Our education?
[00:52:21.725 --> 00:52:22.545]  Our money?
[00:52:22.545 --> 00:52:26.208]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.568 --> 00:52:31.534]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:31.534 --> 00:52:32.555]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.555 --> 00:52:33.716]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.716 --> 00:52:34.618]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:35.519]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:38.042]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:40.985]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:52:40.985 --> 00:52:41.806]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.926 --> 00:52:46.868]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.868 --> 00:52:48.368]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.368 --> 00:52:49.449]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.449 --> 00:52:55.891]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:00.802 --> 00:53:03.804]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:53:03.804 --> 00:53:05.885]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:53:05.885 --> 00:53:08.627]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:53:08.627 --> 00:53:10.848]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:53:10.848 --> 00:53:12.269]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:53:12.269 --> 00:53:14.170]  But first, the facts.
[00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.091]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:53:16.091 --> 00:53:18.092]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:53:18.092 --> 00:53:21.774]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:53:21.774 --> 00:53:29.519]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:53:29.519 --> 00:53:30.139]  Sinofresh.
[00:53:30.399 --> 00:53:33.460]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:50.806]  Mention GCN.

[00:53:51.706 --> 00:53:52.106]  It works!
[00:54:09.605 --> 00:54:11.007]  I mean, think about it.
[00:54:11.007 --> 00:54:19.996]  You had four members of the Supreme Court vote months ago, but it was made public Monday, that there should be no Second Amendment.
[00:54:19.996 --> 00:54:26.142]  Chicago, Mayor Daley's office argued in that court case, no one is allowed to own guns but the police.
[00:54:27.116 --> 00:54:30.057]  Highest crime rate in the country, just spinning out of control.
[00:54:30.057 --> 00:54:31.858]  Criminals don't follow law.
[00:54:31.858 --> 00:54:38.761]  Law-abiding citizens, when they do sneak a gun into Chicago, it's almost always some old lady or some old man defend themselves.
[00:54:38.761 --> 00:54:40.142]  They send them to prison.
[00:54:40.142 --> 00:54:44.444]  They arrest them for defending themselves.
[00:54:44.444 --> 00:54:45.184]  This is incredible.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.981]  And these people want to disarm us.
[00:54:48.981 --> 00:54:51.223]  They say we don't have a right to our private property.
[00:54:51.223 --> 00:54:54.385]  We don't have a right to our free speech, to our guns.
[00:54:54.385 --> 00:54:55.506]  And why are they doing it?
[00:54:55.506 --> 00:54:59.088]  Because they're being blackmailed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:59.088 --> 00:55:03.371]  We cannot have Supreme Court justices that are involved in gambling.
[00:55:03.371 --> 00:55:06.413]  I'm not against people that gamble.
[00:55:06.413 --> 00:55:08.494]  I think you can get out of control and be destructive.
[00:55:08.494 --> 00:55:11.776]  That's not bigoted to be against gambling.
[00:55:11.776 --> 00:55:15.599]  Any more so than I don't dislike gay people.
[00:55:16.874 --> 00:55:18.955]  I don't dislike, you know, I don't hate them.
[00:55:18.955 --> 00:55:19.976]  I understand they're human beings.
[00:55:19.976 --> 00:55:23.218]  I understand they're attracted to what they're attracted to.
[00:55:23.218 --> 00:55:26.560]  I don't like the other weird behaviors that come out of it.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.723]  The gun grabbing, the land grabbing, the, you know, as part of that group, that's what on average they do.
[00:55:31.723 --> 00:55:35.064]  Leave me alone!
[00:55:35.064 --> 00:55:39.167]  I don't like the fact that so many of the CPS workers are homosexuals coming after people's kids.
[00:55:39.167 --> 00:55:40.688]  It's creepy!
[00:55:40.688 --> 00:55:42.689]  Let's just tell it like it is.
[00:55:42.689 --> 00:55:46.031]  And I don't like the fact that Lindsey Graham and all these people are being blackmailed.
[00:55:46.752 --> 00:55:48.492]  Just like if they had a gambling problem.
[00:55:48.492 --> 00:55:50.133]  Just like if they had taken bribes.
[00:55:50.133 --> 00:55:52.033]  They're now compromised.
[00:55:52.033 --> 00:55:59.775]  And if the media made it out in the open that, you know, joining a long history of other lesbians on the court, I mean, she's certainly not the first.
[00:55:59.775 --> 00:56:02.836]  Sotomayor is not the first.
[00:56:02.836 --> 00:56:05.917]  And why do they pick these lesbian lawyers?
[00:56:05.917 --> 00:56:08.417]  Because they can destroy them whenever they want!
[00:56:08.417 --> 00:56:12.578]  Because they're not making it public that they're lesbians.
[00:56:12.578 --> 00:56:14.279]  Just like Lindsey Graham is gay.
[00:56:15.942 --> 00:56:17.443]  And boy, that didn't prove it.
[00:56:17.443 --> 00:56:21.565]  They said, Mr. Graham, we've got all the proof you're gay and you're being blackmailed.
[00:56:21.565 --> 00:56:28.828]  You better stop being for the carbon tax and the open borders and the banker takeover or we're going to bring it all out in the open.
[00:56:28.828 --> 00:56:31.509]  And one day later, that's it.
[00:56:31.509 --> 00:56:32.910]  I'm not for any of this anymore.
[00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:41.313]  I mean, why would Graham do things that are so unpopular in his state that he was assured to lose and is still assured to lose?
[00:56:41.313 --> 00:56:44.575]  Why would he commit political suicide as a senator?
[00:56:47.199 --> 00:56:50.562]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, it's true.
[00:56:50.562 --> 00:56:54.184]  And the gay club got him into the Republican bathhouse.
[00:56:54.184 --> 00:56:56.266]  It's basically what it is.
[00:56:56.266 --> 00:57:04.572]  And, again, why is the Congress, when gay men are supposedly 3% of the population, why are so many Republicans gay?
[00:57:04.572 --> 00:57:05.733]  Because they recruit each other.
[00:57:05.733 --> 00:57:08.255]  They're like, you're compromised now into our criminal club.
[00:57:10.034 --> 00:57:15.756]  That's why when you go to Bohemian Grove, as Richard Nixon said on record, they try to make you have gay sex.
[00:57:15.756 --> 00:57:17.697]  Because it's a rite of passage.
[00:57:17.697 --> 00:57:27.641]  Okay, buddy, we can tell your wife now that you, you know, had sex with these gay porn stars we brought in, if you don't play ball with us.
[00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:29.222]  You understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:57:29.222 --> 00:57:29.962]  It's a cult!
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:38.685]  You may have some gay doctor down the street that you're friends with and you play golf with, whatever.
[00:57:38.685 --> 00:57:40.447]  He's not a bad person.
[00:57:40.447 --> 00:57:46.271]  But these groups up in Washington, I mean, pretty soon you won't be able to be in Congress unless you're gay.
[00:57:46.271 --> 00:57:48.813]  You won't be able to be on the Supreme Court unless you're gay.
[00:57:48.813 --> 00:57:53.657]  You won't be able to, I mean, what, everything's gotta be run?
[00:57:53.657 --> 00:57:54.477]  By gay people?
[00:57:54.477 --> 00:57:58.821]  I mean, this is becoming a total takeover of society, and I'll just say it.
[00:57:59.656 --> 00:58:04.680]  I mean, you're worried about a Russian takeover of America because of 11 spies trying to infiltrate Harvard?
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.602]  Because they know what runs America.
[00:58:06.602 --> 00:58:08.503]  It's cliques run America.
[00:58:08.503 --> 00:58:09.845]  Mafias run America.
[00:58:09.845 --> 00:58:20.914]  You got Dixie Mafia, you got Jewish Mafia, you got Italian Mafia, you got Banker Mafia, you got Gay Mafia, you got Mexican Mafia, you got Black Mafia, and you know what?
[00:58:20.914 --> 00:58:22.896]  I'm with the Constitutional Mafia.
[00:58:22.896 --> 00:58:26.298]  I'm with the Bill of Rights and the private property and get-off-my-land Mafia.
[00:58:26.298 --> 00:58:26.859]  How's that sound?
[00:58:27.079 --> 00:58:28.180]  Get off my land.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.161]  Get out of my life.
[00:58:29.161 --> 00:58:31.182]  I'm going to live my own red-blooded life.
[00:58:31.182 --> 00:58:32.383]  Okay?
[00:58:32.383 --> 00:58:33.244]  I like women.
[00:58:33.244 --> 00:58:34.385]  I like my kids.
[00:58:34.385 --> 00:58:35.546]  I like green grass.
[00:58:35.546 --> 00:58:36.647]  I like T-bone steaks.
[00:58:36.647 --> 00:58:37.107]  Okay?
[00:58:37.107 --> 00:58:38.188]  Let me have my life.
[00:58:38.188 --> 00:58:42.431]  Don't make me live like you.
[00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:45.033]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.033 --> 00:58:47.435]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.171 --> 00:58:55.134]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:58:55.134 --> 00:58:56.115]  What have we got?
[00:58:56.115 --> 00:58:58.576]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:58:58.576 --> 00:58:59.577]  A republic.
[00:58:59.577 --> 00:59:02.218]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:59:02.218 --> 00:59:04.500]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.521]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:59:06.521 --> 00:59:08.202]  So they think they own our land?
[00:59:08.202 --> 00:59:09.523]  They think they own our water?
[00:59:09.523 --> 00:59:10.123]  Children?
[00:59:10.123 --> 00:59:11.244]  Our education?
[00:59:11.244 --> 00:59:12.085]  Our money?
[00:59:12.085 --> 00:59:15.727]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:59:16.087 --> 00:59:19.772]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:59:19.772 --> 00:59:21.074]  You are being warned.
[00:59:21.074 --> 00:59:22.095]  We have the facts.
[00:59:22.095 --> 00:59:23.257]  We have the Constitution.
[00:59:23.257 --> 00:59:24.158]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:59:24.158 --> 00:59:25.039]  We have common law.
[00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:27.563]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:27.563 --> 00:59:31.348]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:59:31.448 --> 00:59:36.412]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:59:36.412 --> 00:59:37.893]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:59:37.893 --> 00:59:38.994]  Don't tread on me.
[00:59:38.994 --> 00:59:53.346]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:59:53.346 --> 00:59:55.728]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.728 --> 00:59:58.511]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.342 --> 01:00:06.643]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.643 --> 01:00:08.424]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.424 --> 01:00:10.166]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.166 --> 01:00:11.767]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.767 --> 01:00:13.308]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.308 --> 01:00:17.512]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:23.296]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.296 --> 01:00:27.159]  My friends, I happen to like fast cars.
[01:00:27.159 --> 01:00:27.960]  I love my wife.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.302]  I love raising my children.
[01:00:30.302 --> 01:00:32.503]  I like just simple things.
[01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:32.824]  I'm not...
[01:00:34.602 --> 01:00:37.923]  I guess I'm not fancy like all the globalists in New York and D.C.
[01:00:37.923 --> 01:00:39.044]  and L.A.
[01:00:39.044 --> 01:00:50.669]  with all their drugs and having sex with animals and, you know, eating their own feces and all the things that people in government and elite positions seem to like to do.
[01:00:50.669 --> 01:00:54.110]  I can't ever get sick of enchiladas and ribeye steaks.
[01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:55.271]  I can't ever get sick of
[01:00:56.519 --> 01:01:00.362]  Just jogging down a forest path, or fishing, or seeing a sunset.
[01:01:00.362 --> 01:01:02.944]  I can't ever get sick of looking at women.
[01:01:02.944 --> 01:01:07.808]  I can't ever get sick of just liking what my human programming is.
[01:01:07.808 --> 01:01:21.219]  And I pointed out at the end of the hour that we have weird cults taking over America, and mafias, and they've divided the country up amongst themselves, and they're trying to force everybody else to basically buy into their cultures.
[01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.960]  And I just want to be left alone.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.003]  But the entire system of deviance, as many would call them,
[01:01:28.191 --> 01:01:32.053]  They see those of us who are normal as the deviants.
[01:01:32.053 --> 01:01:33.693]  See, that's the issue.
[01:01:33.693 --> 01:01:36.855]  I'm the weirdo because I'm not scared of guns.
[01:01:36.855 --> 01:01:39.976]  I'm the weirdo because I'm not afraid to get in a fistfight.
[01:01:39.976 --> 01:01:49.600]  I'm the weirdo because I like to slam the gas down on my car and feel the 450 horsepower explode like a bullet out of a 45 under me.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.861]  I'm the weirdo because I'm red-blooded.
[01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:55.985]  I'm the weirdo because I love the red, white, and blue.
[01:01:55.985 --> 01:02:00.088]  I'm the weirdo because I don't want offshore banks robbing and raping and looting our economy.
[01:02:00.088 --> 01:02:03.911]  I'm a weirdo because I don't like watching cops abuse women and children.
[01:02:03.911 --> 01:02:11.897]  I'm a weirdo, ladies and gentlemen, because I guarantee you I'd have been more at home in 1776 than I am right now in what this country's turned into.
[01:02:11.897 --> 01:02:15.759]  A bunch of weak, domesticated people that doesn't know which end is up.
[01:02:15.759 --> 01:02:16.520]  But here's the deal.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.143]  The majority of Americans know they want a red-blooded lifestyle as well.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.724]  And now they're understanding that they gave in to whatever they were told to go along with.
[01:02:25.724 --> 01:02:27.765]  They gave in to all the political correctness.
[01:02:27.765 --> 01:02:31.208]  And the politically correct armies want to make us their slaves.
[01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:32.569]  They want to run us over.
[01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:33.890]  They want to conquer us.
[01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:35.251]  They didn't want to live in peace.
[01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.372]  They want to run our lives.
[01:02:36.372 --> 01:02:37.533]  They want power.
[01:02:37.533 --> 01:02:42.397]  They want to take over our families and harvest our children.
[01:02:42.397 --> 01:02:44.259]  Like a farmer takes eggs from a hen.
[01:02:44.259 --> 01:02:45.340]  And that isn't going to happen.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.260]  You understand?
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.983]  You've picked a fight, New World Order, that you're going to lose.
[01:02:52.444 --> 01:02:53.325]  Oh, man.
[01:02:53.325 --> 01:02:54.805]  I'm going to come back and get into the economy.
[01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.706]  I'm going to get into the oil spill.
[01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:59.248]  I'm going to get into the latest developments on Iran.
[01:02:59.248 --> 01:03:01.629]  It just gets more and more serious as we track this.
[01:03:01.629 --> 01:03:02.429]  It's all coming up today.
[01:03:02.429 --> 01:03:05.491]  And Ron Paul's scheduled coming up in the last 30 minutes of this broadcast today.
[01:03:07.978 --> 01:03:10.921]  But I'll go back to this Russian spy article.
[01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:13.523]  Spying as networking, Wall Street Journal.
[01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:15.985]  If they were spies, their strategy was unorthodox.
[01:03:15.985 --> 01:03:23.752]  Instead of directly infiltrating government agencies, several of the accused Russian spies apparently tried to glean information by moving in financial elite circles.
[01:03:23.752 --> 01:03:31.699]  One of them graduated, top of their class, from Harvard Kennedy School.
[01:03:31.699 --> 01:03:32.660]  And it goes on from there.
[01:03:33.868 --> 01:03:37.170]  And they tried to set up computer companies and social networking systems.
[01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:40.893]  Well, that's what the British slash New World Order Intel does.
[01:03:40.893 --> 01:03:44.636]  The power has been transferred to the private banks and megacorporations.
[01:03:44.636 --> 01:03:46.517]  They tell the government what to do.
[01:03:46.517 --> 01:03:51.901]  So, of course, the Russians tried to infiltrate Harvard and tried to infiltrate computer companies.
[01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:55.984]  And, of course, they did it with super good-looking women.
[01:03:55.984 --> 01:03:59.547]  How do you think a lot of other women get to the top of these corporations?
[01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:01.108]  They sex their way up to the top.
[01:04:04.184 --> 01:04:08.725]  And so this is not unorthodox, this is actually how real intelligence is carried out.
[01:04:08.725 --> 01:04:14.827]  And of course they're Russian spies, moved here illegally, assumed fake names, operated for over a decade.
[01:04:14.827 --> 01:04:19.028]  And I've heard the neocons blaming Obama for this?
[01:04:19.028 --> 01:04:20.969]  I hate Obama's guts!
[01:04:20.969 --> 01:04:24.790]  But they're saying he allowed the Russians when it's admittedly a 10-year program?
[01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:26.990]  First they said 7, now 10, now 15.
[01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:29.531]  These are sleeper cells!
[01:04:29.531 --> 01:04:32.592]  And they didn't try to get into the Intelligence Committee of the Congress, did they?
[01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:37.411]  No, they tried to get into Harvard, because it's that little mafia running things.
[01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:42.092]  It's a bunch of stinking mafias, like Gerald Salente tells you.
[01:04:42.092 --> 01:04:44.273]  Oh, I'm not against Italians, I'm against the Italian mafia.
[01:04:44.273 --> 01:04:47.434]  I'm not against the Russian people, I'm against their mafia.
[01:04:47.434 --> 01:04:50.495]  I'm not against the British people, I'm against their crime syndicate government mafia.
[01:04:50.495 --> 01:04:54.256]  I'm not against Jews, I'm against their mafia.
[01:04:54.256 --> 01:04:55.136]  You understand that?
[01:04:55.136 --> 01:04:57.757]  It's mafias, it's criminals we're dealing with.
[01:04:57.757 --> 01:04:58.417]  We'll be right back.

[01:06:03.996 --> 01:06:10.401]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:17.787]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:06:17.787 --> 01:06:22.670]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:08:05.461 --> 01:08:10.283]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.283 --> 01:08:11.883]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.883 --> 01:08:13.424]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.424 --> 01:08:17.626]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:21.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:28.150]  Mr. Jones, my name's Chris and I'm a West Virginia resident.
[01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:34.072]  I'm calling you in regards to your comments about our dearly departed Senator, Robert Seabird.
[01:08:36.101 --> 01:08:48.332]  Although Mr. Byrd was a former Klan member, at the time of his death, he enjoyed a 100% approval rating for the NAACP for his voting record.
[01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:52.035]  I would figure if the largest group of black
[01:08:53.396 --> 01:09:01.800]  People in the United States, armed together in a political cause, could forgive the Senator his past discretions.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.963]  A white fella from the middle of Texas could see fit to do the same.
[01:09:07.963 --> 01:09:11.465]  You claim to be a constitutional supporter.
[01:09:11.465 --> 01:09:20.849]  The biggest constitutional supporter this Republic has had for almost 60 years served in the Senate, and his name was Robert Seabird.
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:26.564]  I heard about the Enemy Belligerent Act on your show.
[01:09:26.564 --> 01:09:32.328]  I wrote my Senator, Robert C. Byrd, about that.
[01:09:32.328 --> 01:09:43.457]  He sent me a letter back on May 3rd of this year, probably one of the last letters he ever wrote, to tell me that he would stand against the Enemy Belligerent Act.
[01:09:43.457 --> 01:09:46.580]  I've heard people say bad things about their enemies.
[01:09:47.874 --> 01:09:50.335]  On radio and television.
[01:09:50.335 --> 01:10:11.085]  But I would figure, in a time when the Liberty Movement needs to be consolidated, not picked apart from the inside, you would take a man who West Virginia consider to be the Ron Paul of our state, and drag his name through the mud, before we've had the chance to get him in the ground.
[01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:23.023]  I'll be attending his funeral on Friday, and sir, I'd like to let you know that you would do well to keep yourself outside of West Virginia for that event.
[01:10:23.023 --> 01:10:33.105]  We would rather not hear from an individual who wants to call our dearly departed senator a monster.
[01:10:33.105 --> 01:10:35.466]  Did you hear that territorialism?
[01:10:35.466 --> 01:10:37.226]  I'm sitting here in Texas.
[01:10:37.226 --> 01:10:38.786]  I never said I was going to his funeral.
[01:10:38.786 --> 01:10:39.807]  I wouldn't do such a thing.
[01:10:43.203 --> 01:10:49.267]  This guy, so he can have an excuse to threaten me, says, you better not come around here, boy.
[01:10:49.267 --> 01:10:51.668]  Well, number one, we love West Virginia.
[01:10:51.668 --> 01:10:53.849]  This is a beautiful state, a lot of great people.
[01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:56.811]  You have the very wicked Senator Jay Rockefeller.
[01:10:56.811 --> 01:10:58.092]  You going to tell me how great he is?
[01:10:59.318 --> 01:11:01.280]  Now, Byrd was a mixed bag.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.522]  There are certainly people worse in the Senate.
[01:11:03.522 --> 01:11:10.147]  And I know he did speak out against warrantless spying, torture, and the Enemy Belligerence Act, and the rest of it, to secretly arrest U.S.
[01:11:10.147 --> 01:11:11.428]  citizens.
[01:11:11.428 --> 01:11:20.616]  That said, having the NAACP say he's the best guy out there is a negative in my scorebook.
[01:11:20.616 --> 01:11:27.422]  The NAACP is an anti-gun, pro-abortion, anti-black organization.
[01:11:28.959 --> 01:11:33.500]  And if you did some research on eugenics, you'd know that.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.161]  So, I really don't know what to say to you.
[01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:40.542]  You don't hear the NAACP talking about 51% of black people never being born, do you?
[01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:42.082]  Do you, sir?
[01:11:42.082 --> 01:11:44.282]  Now, look, I probably was a little hard on Byrd.
[01:11:44.282 --> 01:11:46.883]  I never really talked about Byrd.
[01:11:46.883 --> 01:11:49.704]  You know, the guy died, and I said he's probably gonna go to hell.
[01:11:49.704 --> 01:11:56.005]  I said, I'm not God, and I'm not judging him, but he's a gun grabber.
[01:11:57.526 --> 01:11:59.627]  In his votes, a bunch of stuff.
[01:11:59.627 --> 01:12:00.708]  I mean, he was a mixed bag.
[01:12:00.708 --> 01:12:02.509]  He was a liberal.
[01:12:02.509 --> 01:12:05.991]  And I'm just going to tell you right now, I don't like him or Jay Rockefeller.
[01:12:05.991 --> 01:12:08.713]  So, West Virginia, one of your senators is dead.
[01:12:08.713 --> 01:12:11.655]  Maybe you can elect somebody good, a real Ron Paul.
[01:12:11.655 --> 01:12:14.717]  And Jay Rockefeller, you couldn't have a worse senator.
[01:12:14.717 --> 01:12:20.741]  I mean, he is now the head of the Rockefeller crime family.
[01:12:22.236 --> 01:12:30.439]  Literally, he has now taken the reins from David, who's 95 years old and now becoming a little bit incoherent.
[01:12:30.439 --> 01:12:33.501]  A few years ago, he was still well-spoken.
[01:12:33.501 --> 01:12:35.621]  I had a chance to hear a phone message of him.
[01:12:35.621 --> 01:12:45.465]  I was staying in a hotel nearby, and one of the other activists called up the hotel at 5 a.m., got David Rockefeller's room.
[01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:46.446]  It was David Rockefeller.
[01:12:48.035 --> 01:12:51.016]  Had a lengthy conversation with him about the New World Order.
[01:12:51.016 --> 01:12:53.397]  Rockefeller said he had to go.
[01:12:53.397 --> 01:12:59.258]  And then the guy chickened out on ever playing it.
[01:12:59.258 --> 01:13:00.779]  Which was ridiculous.
[01:13:00.779 --> 01:13:05.940]  Because he'd heard Tucker talk about on this show how he'd called Rockefeller's room before.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.401]  See, no one thinks to be bold.
[01:13:09.401 --> 01:13:13.623]  But the word is that Jay is now the true governor.
[01:13:14.665 --> 01:13:16.367]  of the United States.
[01:13:16.367 --> 01:13:23.073]  He is the true corporate president of the conquered United States.
[01:13:23.073 --> 01:13:27.598]  All right, I'm gonna give the toll-free number out to join us on this July 1st, 2010 edition, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:13:27.598 --> 01:13:31.562]  We can talk about Al Gore, the police have reopened the sexual molestation case.
[01:13:41.052 --> 01:13:52.567]  We can talk about the Iran situation, the BP situation, we can talk about the Russian spy info, any of it, but just to put a bookend on the Russian spy thing and then I'm done talking about it.
[01:13:55.359 --> 01:13:58.342]  At least for today, because I haven't really covered it the last two days.
[01:13:58.342 --> 01:14:00.203]  Spying as networking.
[01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:04.447]  If they were spies, their strategy was unorthodox, the Wall Street Journal wrote.
[01:14:04.447 --> 01:14:13.715]  Instead of directly infiltrating government agencies, several of the accused Russian spies apparently tried to glean information by moving in financial and elite circles.
[01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:22.902]  Suspect Donald Howard Heathfield, for example, graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and was an energetic networker who
[01:14:24.022 --> 01:14:32.804]  Promoted his consultancy firm, FutureMap, aimed at governments and business former classmates recall.
[01:14:32.804 --> 01:14:36.305]  By the way, I said we'd go live this hour on TV and we forgot to.
[01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:41.006]  So we'll go live at the bottom of the hour in 15 minutes.
[01:14:41.006 --> 01:14:47.248]  We're gonna go live at the bottom of the hour in 15 minutes, simulcasting the live radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:52.028 --> 01:15:01.276]  Looking back, they say that a telling sign may have been Mr. Heathfield's vagueness while describing the business activities of his firm.
[01:15:01.276 --> 01:15:14.368]  I always thought he was hustling, put a lot of energy into his new clients for FutureMap, said Craig Sandler, Mr. Heathfield's classmate at Harvard Kennedy School, who now owns State House News Service in Boston.
[01:15:14.368 --> 01:15:18.292]  But it was never really clear how FutureMap did what it was supposed to do.
[01:15:19.232 --> 01:15:21.854]  It was excellent about concepts, not specifics.
[01:15:21.854 --> 01:15:32.080]  He never went into specifics, and it goes on to describe the beautiful redhead and other beautiful women and how they were networking and had all this money from Europe.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.183]  This is a global government run by corporations, like the movie Rollerball.
[01:15:36.183 --> 01:15:39.525]  They throw it in your face with that 1970s movie with James Caan.
[01:15:39.525 --> 01:15:46.770]  And so, you don't infiltrate the puppet Congress, 94% of the bills are never even read, according to Senator Dement, and that's
[01:15:48.556 --> 01:15:50.978]  On record with other senators and congressmembers.
[01:15:50.978 --> 01:15:52.959]  You infiltrate corporations.
[01:15:52.959 --> 01:15:54.179]  That's the government.
[01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:58.962]  You infiltrate Harvard, the main organization unit, where they teach them about world government.
[01:15:58.962 --> 01:16:05.286]  They teach them how everybody else is scum and stupid and trash in these business schools, in these government schools, on record.
[01:16:05.286 --> 01:16:17.454]  How a world government's needed, how eugenics is good, how they're part of the elite, how when they start a newspaper or computer company or Facebook or Google or whatever the case is, that they're going to instantly get government front company funding.
[01:16:18.348 --> 01:16:25.330]  Like CIA funding publicly through In-Q-Tel of Google's founding.
[01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:33.132]  And how if they just play ball, and are sickening traitors to America, and help bring down America, they're gonna be given lots of money and power.
[01:16:33.132 --> 01:16:37.934]  And they're a snickering, arrogant, from scum families that hate this country.
[01:16:39.292 --> 01:16:41.194]  You want to talk about Russian spies?
[01:16:41.194 --> 01:16:44.576]  Why were the Russians infiltrating the scum organizations?
[01:16:44.576 --> 01:16:47.779]  Because that's how you get Russian interest.
[01:16:47.779 --> 01:16:51.222]  That's what a Russian patriot would do.
[01:16:51.222 --> 01:16:57.728]  If our FBI and CIA weren't run by Harvard, Yale, and other scum from Princeton,
[01:16:58.939 --> 01:17:04.866]  And that doesn't mean if you're a Harvard doctor, you're into vaccines and socialism, but you're not a traitor.
[01:17:04.866 --> 01:17:10.153]  It's the business school, it's the tech, it's the government school, it's the Kennedy School groups.
[01:17:10.153 --> 01:17:12.115]  They're openly globalist.
[01:17:12.115 --> 01:17:13.858]  We've had top PhDs from Harvard.
[01:17:15.165 --> 01:17:15.625]  We're good to go.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:42.087]  You know, graduates who are globalists, and they said, yes, we're going to get a world government, we're going to enslave everybody, we're into eugenics, we're going to live forever, you're going to be killed.
[01:17:42.087 --> 01:17:45.030]  I mean, imagine telling top British reporters this.
[01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:49.354]  This is how arrogant this scum is, okay?
[01:17:49.354 --> 01:17:53.699]  So of course the Russians tried to infiltrate it.
[01:17:53.699 --> 01:17:56.842]  Because they understand the ballgame.
[01:17:56.842 --> 01:17:58.844]  They understand America has been taken down.
[01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:03.273]  They understand that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:03.273 --> 01:18:07.714]  They understand America is now an engine of offshore banks that are destroying us.
[01:18:07.714 --> 01:18:13.676]  They had the same banks take them over when the Soviet Union fell entirely and steal everything.
[01:18:13.676 --> 01:18:24.240]  And love or hate Putin and Medvedev, but once Yeltsin, the drunken puppet, was out of commission, they took over and kicked the bankers out and took over the op themselves and said,
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:28.622]  Hey, you've been paid not to have kids, we're going to pay you to have kids.
[01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:32.065]  Because Russia lost close to 30% of its population.
[01:18:32.065 --> 01:18:33.726]  And they said, we're against the New World Order.
[01:18:33.726 --> 01:18:36.468]  Of course they play both sides and are completely corrupt.
[01:18:36.468 --> 01:18:42.472]  The issue is, is that yes, we don't need Russian spies in America, but give me a stinking break.
[01:18:42.472 --> 01:18:44.673]  It came out in mainstream newspapers.
[01:18:44.673 --> 01:18:50.137]  New York Times, Yorker Magazine, something we reported before it came out in mainstream news.
[01:18:51.496 --> 01:19:01.865]  That Israeli intelligence actually created the special office in the Pentagon, the special working group, to make up intelligence on Iraq because they wanted the U.S.
[01:19:01.865 --> 01:19:02.766]  to hit Iraq.
[01:19:02.766 --> 01:19:08.591]  You had the weapons industry wanted it and the oil companies wanted it as well.
[01:19:08.591 --> 01:19:10.933]  And notice now that they have it, they're giving it to China and Europe.
[01:19:10.933 --> 01:19:11.653]  These are globalists.
[01:19:11.653 --> 01:19:14.936]  It's all about bringing America down.
[01:19:14.936 --> 01:19:16.437]  Our boys bleed and die.
[01:19:16.437 --> 01:19:19.080]  The offshore banks and globalists get the oil.
[01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:25.594]  Because China needs the oil for its factories to build the widgets to de-industrialize us.
[01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:32.198]  But notice China can't have oil that's on its border in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan.
[01:19:32.198 --> 01:19:36.441]  They can only have oil from thousands of miles away that's shipped to them by the globalists.
[01:19:36.441 --> 01:19:43.386]  It's all about strategic balance.
[01:19:43.386 --> 01:19:43.746]  And so...
[01:19:44.963 --> 01:19:46.404]  This is the bottom line.
[01:19:46.404 --> 01:19:48.145]  Globalism is treason.
[01:19:48.145 --> 01:19:59.753]  Globalism is the criminal overthrow of America and your financial and physical enslavement to a bunch of trash that bought off our universities with endowments and are now like piranhas enjoying the death of this country.
[01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:02.530]  Who is Sam Andy?
[01:20:02.530 --> 01:20:05.031]  Sam Andy Foods is life insurance in a can.
[01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:06.672]  Life insurance you can eat.

[01:20:11.194 --> 01:20:12.255]  Why so long?

[01:20:16.617 --> 01:20:19.258]  Foods that last 15 to 25 years.
[01:20:19.258 --> 01:20:24.021]  And that's made us an industry leader among families, sportsmen, outdoorsmen, churches, schools,
[01:20:24.161 --> 01:20:24.802]  We're good to go.
[01:20:43.235 --> 01:20:44.916]  That's SamAndy.com.
[01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:47.799]  Just like it sounds, SamAndy.com.

[01:20:57.025 --> 01:20:58.306]  Sam Andy Foods.
[01:20:58.306 --> 01:21:00.107]  Life insurance in a can.
[01:21:01.169 --> 01:21:06.458]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:21:06.458 --> 01:21:09.222]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:21:09.222 --> 01:21:13.710]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:21:14.591 --> 01:21:19.073]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:22:00.711 --> 01:22:01.412]  Good day.
[01:22:01.412 --> 01:22:03.114]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:03.114 --> 01:22:03.514]  July 1st, 2010.
[01:22:03.514 --> 01:22:04.515]  Gold opened this morning at $1241.80.
[01:22:04.515 --> 01:22:07.999]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1270.80, $637.40 for a half-ounce, or $318.70 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:22:07.999 --> 01:22:08.800]  That's $1270.80, $637.40, and $318.70.
[01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:23.235]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:23.235 --> 01:22:27.517]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[01:22:27.517 --> 01:22:32.380]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:38.484]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[01:22:38.664 --> 01:22:39.305]  We're good to go.
[01:23:07.245 --> 01:23:19.014]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[01:23:19.014 --> 01:23:22.097]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:27.541]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:23:31.784 --> 01:23:36.509]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[01:23:36.509 --> 01:23:40.393]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[01:23:40.393 --> 01:23:44.276]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[01:23:44.276 --> 01:23:49.441]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long-term storage.
[01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.724]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[01:24:09.502 --> 01:24:19.408]  We're going live, simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:24:39.482 --> 01:24:44.125]  Coming up in about seven minutes at the bottom of the hour.
[01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:51.830]  And I will continue with your phone calls at that point, but I need to first get into the financial news and the latest on the hurricane.
[01:24:53.527 --> 01:24:56.149]  Then we'll cover, of course, what's happening in Iran.
[01:24:56.149 --> 01:25:02.092]  Al Gore, a criminal case reopened against him because now he's not Teflon.
[01:25:02.092 --> 01:25:04.213]  Now he's not seen as God.
[01:25:04.213 --> 01:25:08.696]  Now we know that his Nobel Prize is a fraud and global warming is a fraud.
[01:25:08.696 --> 01:25:12.619]  He is politically mortally wounded, as I've told you in the last year.
[01:25:12.619 --> 01:25:17.481]  Everywhere he goes, he is bullhorned and hounded and exposed as a fraud.
[01:25:17.481 --> 01:25:18.522]  And who kicked that off?
[01:25:18.522 --> 01:25:19.203]  My listeners.
[01:25:19.203 --> 01:25:20.283]  We Are Change.
[01:25:20.283 --> 01:25:21.304]  Great patriots.
[01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:26.892]  We're not left or right, we're seeking the truth and justice.
[01:25:26.892 --> 01:25:28.073]  Does that mean we're always right?
[01:25:28.073 --> 01:25:28.893]  No.
[01:25:28.893 --> 01:25:30.914]  But our heart is in the right place.
[01:25:30.914 --> 01:25:32.195]  Let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:25:32.195 --> 01:25:35.777]  Matt in Minnesota, then Mark, Ernie, Ted and others.
[01:25:35.777 --> 01:25:37.237]  You're on the air.
[01:25:37.237 --> 01:25:38.278]  Hey Alex.
[01:25:38.278 --> 01:25:39.759]  Hello my friend.
[01:25:39.759 --> 01:25:45.702]  When you're talking about seeking truth and justice and man-made climate change and Al Gore's nonsense,
[01:25:46.323 --> 01:26:07.897]  Um, I think it's important for everybody to take the strategy of, um, aligning yourself with science, because whether you're talking about JFK, 9-11, or Man Made Climate Change, um, in order to believe all the official stories of these concepts, these events, you have to completely sell out your values on science.
[01:26:07.897 --> 01:26:13.580]  The official stories for JFK, 9-11, Man Made Climate Change, they do not follow the scientific method.
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:14.661]  They're anti-science.
[01:26:15.675 --> 01:26:22.219]  And after examining all the evidence, I mean, you would just have to be a complete idiot to believe this stuff.
[01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:36.487]  And I think it's important that when people are talking about spreading the truth through the Infowar, that they apply science to their arguments, and debunking these theories, especially with NIST and 9-11.
[01:26:36.487 --> 01:26:43.671]  I mean, the NIST reports are a joke, and I heard you talking a little bit about that on the Opie and Anthony show, and I thought that was a pretty good discussion.
[01:26:45.885 --> 01:26:51.670]  Well, I mean, I think it's important to use science when you're well grounded in it on subject by subject.
[01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:55.853]  But just overall, it's important to point out to people that, look, we're living in tyranny.
[01:26:55.853 --> 01:26:58.735]  Government gets caught lying nine times out of ten.
[01:26:58.735 --> 01:27:00.297]  They're not being truthful.
[01:27:00.297 --> 01:27:02.719]  We know special interests are robbing us.
[01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:03.760]  I mean, for heaven's sakes.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:18.180]  They're now in CNN, Reuters, AP, yesterday announcing they're going to devalue the dollar, and it plunged today, and create a new global SDR, as we told listeners years ago, because the globalists said they would.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.382]  This is high treason!
[01:27:20.273 --> 01:27:28.179]  This is criminal, having the President and Geithner and others in speeches say that they do support moving to SDRs.
[01:27:28.179 --> 01:27:30.021]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:27:30.021 --> 01:27:34.625]  That's the real spies, but they're Goldman Sachs corporate spies.
[01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:39.368]  And we need this idea to get out there, because the Russians know what to infiltrate.
[01:27:39.368 --> 01:27:46.835]  Well, how about the American people publicly call for these corporations that are destroying our sovereignty to be arrested?
[01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:59.576]  You know, to have the people heading this up that have committed all these crimes to be... I mean, listen, the head of Goldman Sachs, the Goldman Sachs division leaders, they've had congressional hearings, they've all committed crimes much bigger than Madoff did.
[01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:02.413]  Clap them in irons.
[01:28:02.413 --> 01:28:04.515]  Remove their criminal system.
[01:28:04.515 --> 01:28:10.059]  Or they're gonna continue to have financial terrorism from the shadows and get away with all this.
[01:28:10.059 --> 01:28:12.461]  It's either us or them.
[01:28:12.461 --> 01:28:13.542]  Us or them.
[01:28:13.542 --> 01:28:17.865]  They will wreck us and reduce us to the equivalent of Mexico or Nigeria.
[01:28:17.865 --> 01:28:20.247]  We must remove them.
[01:28:20.247 --> 01:28:22.248]  They will destroy us.
[01:28:22.248 --> 01:28:28.493]  It is their economic weapon of conquest to make you poor in the process of transferring your wealth to them.
[01:28:29.153 --> 01:28:44.297]  They want you starving so you can't strike back and take your government back and haul them up before a court and throw their big fat Harvard butts and Goldman Sachs butts in prison and their British intelligence and Israeli intelligence butts in prison.
[01:28:44.297 --> 01:28:53.780]  Let me tell British people, let me tell Israeli people, let me tell Americans and cops and good old boys and whatever club you're in that you think is part of the establishment and defense contractor workers.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:00.804]  Or if your family, you know, got contracts from Byrds Contracts in West Virginia and you're mad that I talk bad about him.
[01:29:00.804 --> 01:29:02.786]  You're going to be betrayed.
[01:29:02.786 --> 01:29:04.907]  You will not be at the top of the pyramid.
[01:29:04.907 --> 01:29:06.948]  You are destroying humanity.
[01:29:06.948 --> 01:29:13.093]  You must decide what side you're on and join the Republic and free humanity against the corporate Borg.
[01:29:13.093 --> 01:29:15.234]  They sell weapons to both sides.
[01:29:15.234 --> 01:29:17.495]  They fund the Muslim terrorists.
[01:29:17.495 --> 01:29:19.397]  They jack the water supply.
[01:29:19.397 --> 01:29:22.099]  These are the worst criminals in the world.
[01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:25.100]  It's either us, or them.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:39.587]  Either the smiley face, know-it-all, Eddie Haskell, Harvard trash, who've committed crimes, are brought to justice, or they rob everything we've got, and sick a bunch of dumbed-down, steroid-head cops on us.
[01:29:39.587 --> 01:29:40.588]  Okay?
[01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:44.630]  We've gotta go in and deprogram those roidheads and turn them against the globalists.
[01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:46.311]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:46.311 --> 01:29:47.091]  Stay with us.
[01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:48.051]  Listen to me, roidheads.
[01:29:48.051 --> 01:29:48.912]  You should join us now.
[01:29:50.987 --> 01:29:54.914]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.914 --> 01:29:57.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.256 --> 01:30:04.798]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.798 --> 01:30:05.719]  Number 1.
[01:30:05.719 --> 01:30:09.140]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.000]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.883]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.883 --> 01:30:15.643]  It's true.
[01:30:15.643 --> 01:30:20.505]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.505 --> 01:30:21.326]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.326 --> 01:30:24.907]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.907 --> 01:30:28.629]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.809 --> 01:30:29.610]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:32.373]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.373 --> 01:30:36.057]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.057 --> 01:30:36.857]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.857 --> 01:30:41.002]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:45.767]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.047 --> 01:30:50.211]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:52.013]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:54.255]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:54.255 --> 01:30:56.598]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:05.451]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.451 --> 01:31:09.014]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.014 --> 01:31:11.796]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:11.796 --> 01:31:17.480]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:24.165]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.165 --> 01:31:30.150]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:33.833]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.293 --> 01:31:38.597]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.597 --> 01:31:44.543]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.543 --> 01:31:48.107]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.107 --> 01:31:50.069]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.069 --> 01:31:51.210]  It's here.

[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.561]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.561 --> 01:32:08.883]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:08.883 --> 01:32:10.944]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:10.944 --> 01:32:15.925]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:15.925 --> 01:32:17.126]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.126 --> 01:32:17.846]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.246 --> 01:32:20.127]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.127 --> 01:32:21.188]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.188 --> 01:32:23.389]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.389 --> 01:32:24.730]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:26.271]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.271 --> 01:32:31.535]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.535 --> 01:32:34.677]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.117 --> 01:32:38.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.161]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.161 --> 01:32:41.062]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.062 --> 01:32:42.183]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.183 --> 01:32:43.104]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.104 --> 01:32:44.205]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.205 --> 01:32:47.247]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.247 --> 01:32:50.370]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:51.150]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:03.573 --> 01:33:26.833]  Slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss
[01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:31.470]  Welcome, my friends.
[01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:33.272]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:33.272 --> 01:33:44.502]  I'm going to go ahead and get into the financial news, and then I'm going to take some of your phone calls, and then we will continue on with what's happening with Al Gore.
[01:33:44.502 --> 01:33:47.545]  Portland police reopened Al Gore's sex abuse allegations.
[01:33:47.545 --> 01:33:51.269]  I'm going to get more into the Russian spies infiltrating Harvard.
[01:33:51.869 --> 01:33:55.112]  And infiltrating corporations because they've taken America over.
[01:33:55.112 --> 01:34:01.178]  We were conquered a long time ago, so if the Russians want to infiltrate the government, they infiltrate Harvard and Goldman Sachs, which they were doing.
[01:34:02.979 --> 01:34:05.061]  So continuing, that's what the New World Order is.
[01:34:05.061 --> 01:34:27.419]  They come in, corporate system, buy off your government, have laws passed to transfer governance power to the global corporations, until now you go to a UN meeting, or you read the minutes of an SPP meeting, or a Bilderberg meeting info, or a G20, it's private interest there, openly telling the government what to do, and the government clicks their heels and says, yes sir boss, how high do you want me to jump?
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.941]  Foreign bankers say, jump!
[01:34:29.941 --> 01:34:31.723]  Congress says, how high, boss?
[01:34:31.723 --> 01:34:33.804]  How many trillions do you want, boss?
[01:34:33.804 --> 01:34:37.948]  Then they have hearings later and Congress gets uppity and says, where'd that trillion dollars go?
[01:34:37.948 --> 01:34:40.029]  I'm not going to tell you.
[01:34:40.029 --> 01:34:41.110]  Not going to tell you.
[01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:43.051]  I'm the foreign banker head.
[01:34:43.051 --> 01:34:44.553]  I'm the head of the Treasury.
[01:34:44.553 --> 01:34:46.674]  I'm the head of Goldman Sachs.
[01:34:46.674 --> 01:34:48.175]  I'm the head of Bank of America.
[01:34:48.175 --> 01:34:50.377]  And I'm not going to tell you, little slave.
[01:34:50.377 --> 01:34:54.740]  So, of course the Russians tried to infiltrate the banks.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:57.823]  Of course they tried to infiltrate the illegitimate government.
[01:34:59.838 --> 01:35:01.980]  And that is espionage, and they should get in trouble.
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:04.703]  And by the look of these women, you know how they were infiltrating.
[01:35:04.703 --> 01:35:07.066]  That's spying 101.
[01:35:07.066 --> 01:35:08.006]  So that's coming up too.
[01:35:09.244 --> 01:35:14.807]  But let us first just graze over the top headlines and we'll mine back into these.
[01:35:14.807 --> 01:35:20.650]  Coming up, Ron Paul is scheduled to come up in the last hour today, now an hour and a half from now.
[01:35:20.650 --> 01:35:25.652]  MSNBC radicals stock market and obvious corrupt fraud.
[01:35:25.652 --> 01:35:28.774]  What an amazing quote by an MSNBC host.
[01:35:28.774 --> 01:35:34.597]  We've got that video in the Raw Story article up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:36.318 --> 01:35:38.841]  Continuing, Dow loses 10% in second quarter.
[01:35:38.841 --> 01:35:40.583]  S&P ends down 1,040 points.
[01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:40.763]  CNBC.
[01:35:49.121 --> 01:35:58.345]  Another CNBC story, bad news on economy gives investors more reasons to sell, as the market is down several hundred points today, several hundred yesterday.
[01:35:58.345 --> 01:36:08.509]  In fact, guys, give me the latest stock market number, how many it's down right now, and give me the number, what it's currently at, how many points down and what the number is.
[01:36:08.509 --> 01:36:12.911]  Continuing, Fed made taxpayers unwitting junk bond buyers.
[01:36:14.073 --> 01:36:16.835]  Well, yeah, of tens of trillions of dollars of derivatives.
[01:36:16.835 --> 01:36:20.638]  And there's another 600 trillion, the Washington Post says, hanging out there.
[01:36:20.638 --> 01:36:30.166]  And you're going to pay that through dollar devaluation, through euro devaluation, through yuan and yen devaluation, and through new taxes.
[01:36:30.166 --> 01:36:34.490]  And it's now admitted that it's a global coordinated destruction
[01:36:39.148 --> 01:36:45.651]  And there will now be a new global SDR that you will pay your taxes to at the IMF and World Bank.
[01:36:45.651 --> 01:36:47.812]  And the market is down to 9,741.30, only 32 points.
[01:36:47.812 --> 01:36:49.132]  So it's gone back up some this morning since plunging.
[01:36:56.015 --> 01:36:59.717]  So they plunge protection team likes a slow gradual fall.
[01:36:59.717 --> 01:37:03.999]  Continuing, feds made taxpayers on winning junk bond buyers.
[01:37:03.999 --> 01:37:06.200]  Here's another one out of this star advertiser.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:18.045]  We reported on this a year and a half ago and actually sent reporters to California and got reports from Hawaii where they're trying to lock people up at night who are homeless and not let them live in tent cities.
[01:37:18.045 --> 01:37:20.266]  That's one step away from concentration camps.
[01:37:20.266 --> 01:37:21.647]  California is now starting that.
[01:37:22.796 --> 01:37:30.359]  Homeless camps cover 50 acres from Wapeo Point around Middle Lock and to Pearl City.
[01:37:30.359 --> 01:37:34.861]  And just thousands and thousands of people, the star advertiser.
[01:37:34.861 --> 01:37:44.944]  Funny, the advertiser reported eight days before, I have a copy of it, Pearl Harbor, that they were gonna attack on the December 7th.
[01:37:44.944 --> 01:37:51.927]  They'd even gotten the intel and then the base was ordered to stand down and they follow orders in the Navy and in the Marines and Army.
[01:37:53.251 --> 01:37:55.392]  You know, you see a newspaper, and you remember all the other headlines.
[01:37:55.392 --> 01:37:58.753]  Yeah, it was the Honolulu Advertiser at the time.
[01:37:58.753 --> 01:38:02.374]  It's been changed to the Star Advertiser, but same paper, I'm told.
[01:38:02.374 --> 01:38:07.035]  So, just a little side note there.
[01:38:07.035 --> 01:38:07.855]  Continuing.
[01:38:07.855 --> 01:38:13.677]  Dollar should be replaced as international standard, UN report says.
[01:38:13.677 --> 01:38:15.758]  I covered this some yesterday, but you just can't.
[01:38:17.148 --> 01:38:39.094]  Michelle Bachman came out yesterday morning on a radio show and quoted from this a global government being established by the IMF World Bank that you'll pay your carbon taxes to and they will now, as I told you years ago, still have the dollar, the article says that, but it'll be denominated and pegged to an international board of private banks who you will then pay taxes to for the right to hold dollars or to have new currency issued or credit issued.
[01:38:40.267 --> 01:38:45.331]  So this, before the private bankers had to act through national governments, but now they've taken those over.
[01:38:45.331 --> 01:38:57.560]  So now they're just transcending borders completely and are building their world government openly and sucking the nation states completely dry, like Nosferatu would, one of his victims.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:01.263]  They've gone from sucking individuals dry to just sucking everyone dry.
[01:39:01.263 --> 01:39:02.464]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:39:02.464 --> 01:39:04.885]  Japanese may strike over weekend.
[01:39:04.885 --> 01:39:06.587]  And that's the Honolulu advertiser.
[01:39:06.587 --> 01:39:08.028]  How did you guys find that so fast?
[01:39:09.418 --> 01:39:13.062]  And that date was actually eight days before.
[01:39:13.062 --> 01:39:14.383]  People ask, well how?
[01:39:14.383 --> 01:39:18.768]  Because they were giving Japanese time, which was a day earlier.
[01:39:18.768 --> 01:39:20.089]  But yeah, there it is.
[01:39:20.089 --> 01:39:21.731]  Japanese may strike over weekend.
[01:39:21.731 --> 01:39:22.772]  Then they list December 7th.
[01:39:25.425 --> 01:39:26.425]  1941, a day that will live in infamy.
[01:39:26.425 --> 01:39:31.028]  See, we had patriots in the Navy, patriots in the Army, patriots in the Marines.
[01:39:31.028 --> 01:39:34.470]  They'd broken the Japanese purple and blue code a year before.
[01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:37.232]  The British had given it to the United States a year before.
[01:39:37.232 --> 01:39:38.273]  The spymasters had.
[01:39:38.273 --> 01:39:42.175]  And, uh, because they had a whole global empire to run.
[01:39:42.175 --> 01:39:44.336]  Sun never set on the British Empire, and it doesn't today.
[01:39:44.336 --> 01:39:51.981]  Uh, and, um... Yeah, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, the guys just found that.
[01:39:51.981 --> 01:39:53.001]  Will you guys save that?
[01:39:54.167 --> 01:39:58.328]  Years ago, I found a copy of it in a book.
[01:39:58.328 --> 01:40:03.949]  And then I had one of my guys spend a lot of money getting it from the archives.
[01:40:03.949 --> 01:40:07.909]  And it took us about a week to figure out they changed the name.
[01:40:07.909 --> 01:40:12.230]  And then once we found it, it was sent to me, an original copy.
[01:40:12.230 --> 01:40:14.931]  Cost, I think, like 50 bucks, I forget.
[01:40:14.931 --> 01:40:16.711]  And then I lost it somewhere around the office.
[01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:19.691]  But you found an online photo of it framed.
[01:40:19.691 --> 01:40:21.412]  Japanese made Strike Over Weekend.
[01:40:21.412 --> 01:40:23.032]  And see, a whole little advertiser, just like I said.
[01:40:23.953 --> 01:40:31.281]  That's why the guys, you know, I can put an ad in Craigslist and I don't tell people they're coming to work for Alex Jones.
[01:40:32.116 --> 01:40:32.296]  I think?
[01:41:02.416 --> 01:41:04.358]  I don't know how I got off into that whole subject.
[01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:09.703]  Oh yeah, I hire people and a lot of times they're like, yeah, I don't believe a word you say, but I'm taking the job.
[01:41:09.703 --> 01:41:12.085]  I'm like, you're exactly who we want.
[01:41:12.085 --> 01:41:15.368]  But when I'm talking about things, you will randomly search engine them.
[01:41:15.368 --> 01:41:18.371]  And then they search engine and everything I say is right there for them.
[01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:21.274]  No matter how insane it is, just all admitted.
[01:41:21.274 --> 01:41:23.476]  You can also pull up, but I can't remember the exact headline.
[01:41:24.551 --> 01:41:26.353]  The San Diego, uh, what is it?
[01:41:26.353 --> 01:41:27.133]  Herald Tribune?
[01:41:27.133 --> 01:41:32.458]  64 article when the ships got back a few months later and they got off and said, nobody attacked us.
[01:41:32.458 --> 01:41:33.359]  We're told to shut up.
[01:41:33.359 --> 01:41:35.040]  It's all staged.
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.606]  That's how we know Tonkin was staged and 40 something years later, we now know, but you can pull that one up.
[01:41:40.606 --> 01:41:45.470]  Wait, wait, wait, let me pull up the exact headline out of my mind.
[01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.890]  I can do it.
[01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:47.231]  Hold on.
[01:41:47.231 --> 01:41:47.392]  It's a 1964.
[01:41:47.392 --> 01:41:47.432]  Um,
[01:41:53.795 --> 01:41:55.877]  Article out of San Diego.
[01:41:55.877 --> 01:41:57.018]  I think it's Herald Tribune.
[01:41:57.018 --> 01:42:02.582]  I think it's the name of the paper and The exact headline is hold on just a minute.
[01:42:02.582 --> 01:42:20.778]  I'm gonna try to remember this right now Sailors say ships not attacked in Tonkin Gulf Sailors say ships not attacked in Tonkin Gulf and then the article
[01:42:22.065 --> 01:42:32.791]  Quotes them, including senior officers, as saying that they were told not to talk about it, and that they believe it was a staged event.
[01:42:32.791 --> 01:42:37.734]  I think they even used false flags, they're Navy guys.
[01:42:37.734 --> 01:42:39.075]  See if you can get that.
[01:42:39.075 --> 01:42:40.516]  The internet's incredible.
[01:42:40.516 --> 01:42:42.036]  Okay.
[01:42:42.036 --> 01:42:44.238]  Side issue, I'm already digressing, but that's what I do.
[01:42:45.509 --> 01:42:46.730]  Going over the financial news.
[01:42:46.730 --> 01:42:49.132]  Dollars should be replaced as international standard.
[01:42:49.132 --> 01:42:58.099]  The UN report says, but don't worry, you'll still have the euro and the dollar, but now these bankers will be able to do even more currency manipulation, driving it up, driving it down.
[01:42:58.099 --> 01:43:00.321]  So they'll have the best of both worlds.
[01:43:00.321 --> 01:43:07.106]  They'll be able to manipulate currencies with insider trading to consolidate their power through fraud, but only select mega groups.
[01:43:07.106 --> 01:43:11.010]  They'll be able to buy up all their competition with that unfair advantage.
[01:43:11.010 --> 01:43:14.713]  It's more than unfair advantage, it's like straightjacketing the other football team and
[01:43:16.144 --> 01:43:16.645]  New York Times.
[01:43:31.935 --> 01:43:38.238]  And that's why all these scum are so arrogant, talking about how they're the master elite and we deserve to be slaves.
[01:43:38.238 --> 01:43:44.942]  And I guess in a way we do if we let a bunch of frauds, a bunch of Ken Lay Madoff types just openly rob everything.
[01:43:44.942 --> 01:43:50.725]  And I guess if the cops want to follow the orders and all the bureaucrats do and all the workers, then I guess you're going to get what you deserve.
[01:43:50.725 --> 01:43:53.246]  Go drink some fluoride on me.
[01:43:53.246 --> 01:43:56.788]  So to that ACDC song, have a drink on me!
[01:43:56.788 --> 01:43:58.289]  Have a drink on me!
[01:43:59.525 --> 01:44:01.207]  Have some fluoride on me!
[01:44:01.207 --> 01:44:22.585]  I mean, if you can't read the vaccine insert where it says it can give you cancer, brain damage you, and sterilize your butt, you don't care about your kids enough to read the insert, you stupid housewives out there, you stupid, stupid yuppie women, and I'm not saying women are stupid, but I'm talking about those particular stupid housewives and soccer moms that shoot their kid up with every shot known to man and wonder why their 10-year-old kid can't hardly talk.
[01:44:23.246 --> 01:44:24.267]  You stupid witch!
[01:44:24.267 --> 01:44:25.689]  You stupid dingbat!
[01:44:25.689 --> 01:44:27.972]  Go read the stinking insert!
[01:44:27.972 --> 01:44:30.955]  And if calling you names is what it takes to get you to read something, I'll do it.
[01:44:30.955 --> 01:44:33.538]  I've learned sweet-talking these people doesn't get anything done.
[01:44:33.538 --> 01:44:36.902]  You gotta slap these people upside the head with a metaphorical 2x4.
[01:44:36.902 --> 01:44:40.085]  And I will do it so you don't hurt your precious little children, you scum!
[01:44:40.746 --> 01:44:52.975]  And you, you, you, you scum out there that worship all these fake liberal groups like the NAACP that was set up and created so they could push eugenics on blacks and abortions on blacks.
[01:44:52.975 --> 01:44:56.878]  If you think killing black people's pro-black, then I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[01:44:56.878 --> 01:44:58.939]  I mean, you got to get mad.
[01:44:58.939 --> 01:44:59.780]  You got to get angry.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:03.262]  You got to start seeing through just how crazy all this garbage is.
[01:45:03.262 --> 01:45:06.364]  All right, I'm getting angry.
[01:45:06.364 --> 01:45:07.565]  I'm getting angry, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:07.565 --> 01:45:08.606]  I got to settle down a little bit.
[01:45:10.546 --> 01:45:17.492]  I've decided starting in the middle of July, in just 12 days, I'm going to make this announcement here now.
[01:45:17.492 --> 01:45:19.473]  I'm going to three hours instead of four.
[01:45:19.473 --> 01:45:23.437]  I've been doing four hours for two years and I've just, I've got to build a new TV studio.
[01:45:23.437 --> 01:45:28.601]  I want to do a TV report every day, I've decided, and it just drains me too much the fourth hour.
[01:45:28.601 --> 01:45:30.803]  I need that energy to go into the TV show.
[01:45:31.383 --> 01:45:37.366]  Plus, I can say it all in three hours like I did for 13 years before I switched over to four hours.
[01:45:37.366 --> 01:45:39.627]  And we'll just re-air the first hour and the fourth hour.
[01:45:39.627 --> 01:45:42.949]  So if a station's already carrying the fourth hour, don't worry, it'll just be the first hour.
[01:45:42.949 --> 01:45:47.932]  So those adjustments will be made and the network sends my show out 24 hours a day on the satellite.
[01:45:47.932 --> 01:45:53.355]  But there was a reason I got into that issue as well.
[01:45:54.676 --> 01:46:05.823]  Oh, we're just going to start simulcasting the full three hours every day, so there's none of it that's not covered on PrisonPlanet.TV and then archived starting July 12th.
[01:46:05.823 --> 01:46:15.890]  We will be three hours a day and all three hours will be simulcast at PrisonPlanet.TV, if the hair lips the Admiral, if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek.
[01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:24.396]  Because what happens is I tend to get in here and then rant in the first hour some of my best material and the most important info we cover.
[01:46:25.519 --> 01:46:30.834]  And then I tend to overheat by the fourth hour and just start babbling and
[01:46:32.759 --> 01:46:36.822]  I'll do stuff like comb my hair straight back in the morning and not even comb it.
[01:46:36.822 --> 01:46:42.507]  So I almost just have, don't air the first hour because I need to, I forget to comb my hair before I go on TV.
[01:46:42.507 --> 01:46:45.850]  So I'll just start having to get ready before I go live, getting here a little bit early.
[01:46:45.850 --> 01:46:52.856]  Because I'm the type of guy that gets out of the shower, combs my hair straight back, brush my teeth, shoot some deodorant on, put my socks on, put my clothes on.
[01:46:52.856 --> 01:46:56.539]  It takes me about seven, eight minutes to get showered, dressed, ready.
[01:46:56.539 --> 01:46:59.022]  And I've got to start converting over more to the TV mode.
[01:46:59.889 --> 01:47:03.611]  I may have to start going to the salon every day and having my hair done.
[01:47:03.611 --> 01:47:05.292]  That's a joke, folks.
[01:47:05.292 --> 01:47:07.954]  That's a joke.
[01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:14.298]  I've come here to kick butt and chew bubblegum when I'm all out of bubblegum.
[01:47:14.298 --> 01:47:18.821]  You gotta have some comic relief, my friends, when everything is disintegrating like it is.
[01:47:18.821 --> 01:47:19.962]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[01:47:19.962 --> 01:47:23.004]  Dollars should be replaced, as International Standard UN report says.
[01:47:23.004 --> 01:47:24.505]  This is high treason.
[01:47:24.505 --> 01:47:25.505]  And our government agrees.
[01:47:25.505 --> 01:47:27.066]  Geithner agrees.
[01:47:27.066 --> 01:47:28.047]  Obama agrees.
[01:47:28.047 --> 01:47:29.108]  Barry Sitaro agrees.
[01:47:32.034 --> 01:47:32.954]  Here's another one.
[01:47:32.954 --> 01:47:34.335]  I've been covering this the last few days.
[01:47:34.335 --> 01:47:37.496]  A whole bunch of mainstream news, New York Times, Wall Street Journal.
[01:47:37.496 --> 01:47:39.197]  They all admit, okay, we're in a depression.
[01:47:39.197 --> 01:47:41.257]  Third depression.
[01:47:41.257 --> 01:47:45.719]  Fed officials avoid talk of further stimulus to stoke growth.
[01:47:45.719 --> 01:47:54.642]  Yeah, because they've already got a stimulus package passed that means unlimited money in an open window where they can go there every week if they want and get $887 million.
[01:47:54.642 --> 01:47:56.783]  That's an open revolving door.
[01:47:56.783 --> 01:47:58.444]  That's why Bloomberg reports it's
[01:47:59.568 --> 01:47:59.868]  You know what?
[01:48:15.413 --> 01:48:19.454]  It's like, do you want me to shoot you in the head a hundred times or a thousand times at a certain point?
[01:48:19.454 --> 01:48:21.274]  I mean, it just doesn't even matter.
[01:48:21.274 --> 01:48:26.655]  The level of fraud these delicate little geniuses have created, and I guess they are delicate geniuses.
[01:48:26.655 --> 01:48:37.257]  I guess the Goldman Sachs, Harvard scum, foreign intelligence operatives that run our country, the corporate intelligence operatives that have fully turned our government over to themselves, I guess they are better than us.
[01:48:37.257 --> 01:48:38.377]  I guess we do deserve it.
[01:48:38.377 --> 01:48:39.798]  I guess we are idiots.
[01:48:39.798 --> 01:48:41.138]  Well, I'm not an idiot, trash.
[01:48:42.233 --> 01:48:45.236]  And just like the Founding Fathers, I don't want to be your offshore slave.
[01:48:45.236 --> 01:48:49.539]  There's always going to be another minority that doesn't want to be a parasite that wants to be left alone.
[01:48:49.539 --> 01:48:55.865]  So, okay, you're a minority that's taking over all the mainline schmucks out there that want to suck their thumbs all day.
[01:48:55.865 --> 01:48:57.306]  I'm not one of them.
[01:48:57.306 --> 01:48:58.147]  You understand that?
[01:48:58.147 --> 01:48:59.949]  And I am not your property.
[01:48:59.949 --> 01:49:00.990]  I'm declaring it!
[01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:03.572]  You've drawn first blood in a thousand different ways.
[01:49:03.572 --> 01:49:05.173]  Get off my back, parasite!
[01:49:05.173 --> 01:49:08.036]  Because you're going to find out you're not the better man.
[01:49:09.417 --> 01:49:12.740]  You're gonna find out, like all bullies, that the bigger you are, the harder you're gonna fall.
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:19.065]  And I think you recognize now the people are angry, and there's no way for you to spin this, you little, you little pieces of crap.
[01:49:19.065 --> 01:49:26.751]  And you're gonna try to focus us in on Rooskies and Chi-Coms, and, oh yeah, you know, Chi-Coms especially are a threat, a threat you created!
[01:49:26.751 --> 01:49:37.960]  And you're gonna try to focus us in on all these other enemies and little turban-head brown people that you funded and created, so we'll give up all our rights to you so you can rape us financially and physically.
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:42.922]  But we know it's a corporate globalist treason takeover.
[01:49:42.922 --> 01:49:44.644]  Corporations are bigger than governments.
[01:49:44.644 --> 01:49:45.804]  More powerful.
[01:49:45.804 --> 01:49:47.666]  And that's what the New World Order is.
[01:49:47.666 --> 01:49:52.549]  And we are calling you out, trash.
[01:49:52.549 --> 01:49:57.172]  In fact, on the subject of BP, before I get back to the economy, I'm going to get more into BP later.
[01:49:57.172 --> 01:49:59.754]  I've been hearing for the last month, and I really haven't covered it, and I should.
[01:49:59.754 --> 01:50:01.635]  Everybody should buy from BP.
[01:50:01.635 --> 01:50:04.437]  Obama's being mean to them, and it's going to hurt the station owners.
[01:50:05.981 --> 01:50:09.642]  Well, most BP stations are owned by the company.
[01:50:09.642 --> 01:50:15.063]  They're not franchises like Valero or something, or some of the other companies that are out there.
[01:50:15.063 --> 01:50:19.744]  Most of them are owned by the parent mafia organization that's completely owned by big banks.
[01:50:19.744 --> 01:50:23.184]  BP is just a front company, on record.
[01:50:23.184 --> 01:50:24.745]  Basically British intelligence.
[01:50:24.745 --> 01:50:26.985]  They used BP employees to overthrow Iran in 1953.
[01:50:26.985 --> 01:50:28.285]  That's on record.
[01:50:28.285 --> 01:50:29.766]  Operation Ajax declassified in 1999.
[01:50:33.996 --> 01:50:36.677]  BP created Obama with Goldman Sachs.
[01:50:36.677 --> 01:50:38.057]  It's one and the same.
[01:50:38.057 --> 01:50:39.618]  Goldman Sachs owns BP.
[01:50:39.618 --> 01:50:41.919]  The biggest shareholder.
[01:50:41.919 --> 01:50:45.020]  They created the carbon tax with Ken Lay and Enron.
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:49.662]  On record in the mid-90s with Al Gore.
[01:50:49.662 --> 01:50:53.883]  But the fake Republicans are acting like Obama's hurting them.
[01:50:53.883 --> 01:50:54.763]  Hurting BP.
[01:50:54.763 --> 01:50:57.024]  Playing along with the fake left-right paradigm.
[01:50:57.024 --> 01:50:58.585]  It makes me sick!
[01:50:58.585 --> 01:50:59.125]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.019 --> 01:51:09.426]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[01:52:00.748 --> 01:52:02.050]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.050 --> 01:52:07.657]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.657 --> 01:52:12.664]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.664 --> 01:52:17.710]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.231 --> 01:52:23.455]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.455 --> 01:52:25.776]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:25.776 --> 01:52:30.579]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.579 --> 01:52:31.700]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:34.762]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.762 --> 01:52:38.385]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.385 --> 01:52:41.567]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:41.567 --> 01:52:43.788]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:43.788 --> 01:52:44.729]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:48.351 --> 01:52:52.598]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:52.598 --> 01:52:57.427]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.427 --> 01:52:59.831]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.802 --> 01:53:04.166]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:53:04.166 --> 01:53:08.071]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:53:08.071 --> 01:53:11.795]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:53:11.795 --> 01:53:19.104]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[01:53:19.224 --> 01:53:19.584]  I think so.
[01:53:34.241 --> 01:53:34.501]  I think so.
[01:54:05.811 --> 01:54:09.514]  If you want to gamble, I tell you I'm your man.
[01:54:09.514 --> 01:54:11.556]  You win some, you lose some.
[01:54:11.556 --> 01:54:21.764]  It's all a game to me!
[01:54:21.764 --> 01:54:26.428]  Alright, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:26.428 --> 01:54:30.411]  I didn't get into all of the news on the economy.
[01:54:30.411 --> 01:54:33.873]  I'll continue covering that in the next hour and then get into the oil spill.
[01:54:34.997 --> 01:54:36.138]  We're good to go.
[01:54:49.159 --> 01:54:53.121]  That lady came out in Houston and said George W. raped her and she was dead a week later.
[01:54:53.121 --> 01:54:54.442]  Suicide.
[01:54:54.442 --> 01:54:57.844]  The evidence did show that she worked in and around them.
[01:54:57.844 --> 01:55:02.506]  The Bushes have had a lot of maids die, get run over, get killed, be found dead on the beach.
[01:55:02.506 --> 01:55:05.468]  In Georgia, in Maine, in Texas.
[01:55:05.468 --> 01:55:08.870]  You don't want to be a domestic servant of the Bushes and make them mad because
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:14.546]  You don't want to write a book about Bush being a cokehead during the election.
[01:55:14.546 --> 01:55:15.487]  It didn't matter after.
[01:55:15.487 --> 01:55:21.196]  You're going to slit your wrist, boy, and be found dead in a bathtub in Arkansas.
[01:55:21.196 --> 01:55:24.422]  It's one of their favorite places to kill people because that state is so corrupt.
[01:55:26.405 --> 01:55:27.605]  Every state's corrupt though.
[01:55:27.605 --> 01:55:33.387]  Illinois, Texas, Arkansas, West Virginia, New York, Florida.
[01:55:33.387 --> 01:55:35.388]  Everybody always says, man, that's a corrupt state.
[01:55:35.388 --> 01:55:37.769]  Michigan, California, that's a corrupt state.
[01:55:37.769 --> 01:55:38.849]  Oregon, they're corrupt.
[01:55:38.849 --> 01:55:40.429]  Nevada, they're corrupt.
[01:55:40.429 --> 01:55:42.010]  New Mexico, they're corrupt.
[01:55:42.010 --> 01:55:43.290]  New Hampshire, man, they're corrupt.
[01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:47.132]  They're all corrupt.
[01:55:47.132 --> 01:55:51.153]  So I'm gonna go to your phone calls and just go through those from
[01:55:52.631 --> 01:56:08.944]  Mark and Ernie and Matt and Scott and Frank and then we will continue with all of the news and Kagan they're asking your softball questions if she's a fan of the show Twilight and I can't believe she even knew what they were talking about I had to look it up at some werewolf show or something I mean
[01:56:13.936 --> 01:56:19.357]  But they knew that was a way, because the first couple days she never smiled, so they started like throwing her softballs.
[01:56:19.357 --> 01:56:24.558]  And then she looked even crazier after that with these fake smiles, like the Joker.
[01:56:24.558 --> 01:56:28.359]  Hi, I'm Elena Kagan.
[01:56:28.359 --> 01:56:30.080]  Do I like werewolves or vampires?
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.460]  Well, gee, I actually like Igor.
[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:34.821]  That's more of what I'm into.
[01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:36.741]  Igor's a little helper.
[01:56:36.741 --> 01:56:40.322]  We'll have nine Igors on the court with rolling pins, not gavels.
[01:56:41.397 --> 01:56:44.939]  Me and the girls will all go out and have fun together.
[01:56:44.939 --> 01:56:46.819]  We like to go to the topless bar together.
[01:56:46.819 --> 01:56:49.100]  All right, I'm sorry.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:54.443]  I need to quit screwing around, don't I, a little bit.
[01:56:54.443 --> 01:56:57.684]  We're going to go to break here and go directly to your calls when we start the next hour.
[01:56:57.684 --> 01:57:03.787]  I do want to just tell listeners that, you know, I have trouble with this news.
[01:57:03.787 --> 01:57:04.467]  It's so heavy.
[01:57:04.467 --> 01:57:05.207]  It's so hardcore.
[01:57:05.207 --> 01:57:06.268]  We're on the verge of World War III.
[01:57:08.888 --> 01:57:15.713]  The oil with the hurricanes is on its way, and the way they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off is hysterical about a little bit of oil.
[01:57:15.713 --> 01:57:22.459]  And the government's blocking the cleanup out in the Gulf, just waiting for the hurricanes to blow in the oil so they can have their crisis.
[01:57:22.459 --> 01:57:28.664]  And the banking takeover of every financial institution and any organization that, quote, affects the economy.
[01:57:30.083 --> 01:57:36.024]  And all the crazy legislation about arresting US citizens for no reason and the end of the internet.
[01:57:36.024 --> 01:57:36.924]  You know what?
[01:57:36.924 --> 01:57:41.165]  I do tend to start getting a little bit smart mouth and arrogant and angry.
[01:57:41.165 --> 01:57:43.105]  And I've really got to try to control myself.
[01:57:43.105 --> 01:57:46.146]  And that's why I'm down on myself a little bit.
[01:57:46.146 --> 01:57:53.127]  Because nobody's perfect and I realize the position I'm in and I need to be focused.
[01:57:53.127 --> 01:57:54.607]  So I will pledge this.
[01:57:54.607 --> 01:57:57.788]  The next two hours will be serious, like a focused laser beam.
[01:57:58.874 --> 01:57:59.815]  I've been pretty serious.
[01:57:59.815 --> 01:58:04.538]  I screw around less than most hosts, but I am screwing around, and I've got to be my own governor.
[01:58:04.538 --> 01:58:10.062]  In fact, guys in the control room, tell me right now, no more screwing around.
[01:58:10.062 --> 01:58:11.143]  No more screwing around.
[01:58:11.143 --> 01:58:14.646]  So it's going to be Mr. Serious coming up in the next two hours.
[01:58:14.646 --> 01:58:15.967]  It's just this stuff's so absurd.
[01:58:15.967 --> 01:58:19.309]  I mean, that clown Kagan up there, like a demonic penguin,
[01:58:22.423 --> 01:58:25.284]  It's just made for humor, but it's not funny.
[01:58:25.284 --> 01:58:26.584]  It's gallows humor is what it is.
[01:58:26.584 --> 01:58:29.305]  Don't forget the online video bookstores at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:29.305 --> 01:58:36.307]  Not only are the best and most informative titles there to wake up your friends and family, but it also supports us when you buy the books, t-shirts, and materials.
[01:58:36.307 --> 01:58:38.368]  They want to shut down alternative media for a reason.
[01:58:38.368 --> 01:58:42.769]  This stuff's hurting them!
[01:58:42.769 --> 01:58:45.390]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:55.991 --> 02:00:05.553]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.553 --> 02:00:06.854]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.854 --> 02:00:08.634]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.634 --> 02:00:09.795]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.795 --> 02:00:11.975]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.975 --> 02:00:13.516]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.516 --> 02:00:17.717]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.717 --> 02:00:21.798]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.603 --> 02:00:25.584]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:25.584 --> 02:00:28.324]  We've reached the halfway point in worldwide transmission.
[02:00:28.324 --> 02:00:41.387]  We're simulcasting the radio broadcast that's on XM, AM and FM stations, Global, Shortwave, other satellite systems, the internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with the free audio streams.
[02:00:41.387 --> 02:00:44.928]  We also simulcast a video stream at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:44.928 --> 02:00:47.028]  Okay, I'm going to your calls for 30 minutes.
[02:00:47.028 --> 02:00:48.969]  I'll continue with calls into the next hour.
[02:00:48.969 --> 02:00:50.789]  Ron Paul's scheduled to join us for a half hour.
[02:00:52.469 --> 02:00:54.671]  But he may come on at the start of the hour or the end of the hour.
[02:00:54.671 --> 02:00:56.153]  He's got votes coming up.
[02:00:56.153 --> 02:00:58.655]  Congress is in session right now.
[02:00:58.655 --> 02:01:01.618]  So Ron Paul coming up with key info next hour.
[02:01:01.618 --> 02:01:06.003]  The Federal Elections Commission is trying to persecute him right now as well.
[02:01:06.003 --> 02:01:11.208]  He's calling this a premeditated, illegitimate attack, trying to shut down our free speech.
[02:01:11.208 --> 02:01:12.870]  So that's coming up.
[02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:13.471]  The economy.
[02:01:14.872 --> 02:01:20.357]  The Iran situation, the oil, the Al Gore criminal investigation opened for basically rape.
[02:01:20.357 --> 02:01:26.023]  I mean, you start trying to make a woman have sex with you and grabbing on her parts, that's sexual assault.
[02:01:26.023 --> 02:01:27.584]  So, and you know what?
[02:01:27.584 --> 02:01:28.205]  I think he did it.
[02:01:28.205 --> 02:01:28.986]  I think she's credible.
[02:01:30.202 --> 02:01:35.603]  I mean, you investigate for 15 years every day intensely, you get a feel for these things.
[02:01:35.603 --> 02:01:42.625]  I don't say we can put him away for it yet, but he just looks like a big fat rapist, but he likes to rape our freedom.
[02:01:42.625 --> 02:01:45.345]  He's a lying fraud with the carbon tax.
[02:01:45.345 --> 02:01:47.566]  He was a lying fraud with the cap-and-trade.
[02:01:47.566 --> 02:01:49.046]  Okay, that's enough.
[02:01:49.046 --> 02:01:50.326]  It's coming up.
[02:01:50.326 --> 02:01:51.366]  It's coming up.
[02:01:51.366 --> 02:01:52.907]  Mark in New York, you're on the air.
[02:01:52.907 --> 02:01:54.227]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:54.227 --> 02:01:54.747]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:54.747 --> 02:01:58.648]  Eight years plus since I talked to you last, southwestern New York.
[02:01:59.346 --> 02:02:04.649]  I wanted to call and tell you about a meeting I attended last night.
[02:02:04.649 --> 02:02:10.232]  It turned out to be an organization, mostly I would say of neocons, called GO.
[02:02:10.232 --> 02:02:26.440]  This is not a promotion of their dot com, but it stands for Get Out of Our House, which was basically another neocon circled jerk as far as I was concerned, asking loaded questions about concons.
[02:02:28.223 --> 02:02:34.889]  You know, whether we should amend the Constitution to exclude people with law degrees from serving in the House of Representatives.
[02:02:34.889 --> 02:02:36.871]  Yeah, that's a red herring, you can't do that.
[02:02:36.871 --> 02:02:42.576]  I mean, the problem is, a con-con, once you open a constitutional convention up, everything's on the table.
[02:02:42.576 --> 02:02:44.078]  That's right.
[02:02:44.078 --> 02:02:49.663]  And guaranteed the globalists would stage a terror attack, and during the hysteria, abolish everything.
[02:02:49.663 --> 02:02:52.205]  A con-con is deadly.
[02:02:52.205 --> 02:02:52.986]  That's what I told them.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:59.201]  Hey, can I give a shout-out to my son in Wisconsin, Justin?
[02:02:59.201 --> 02:03:05.083]  He's 29 today, and he woke up on his own a half-dozen years ago.
[02:03:05.083 --> 02:03:07.024]  God bless him.
[02:03:07.024 --> 02:03:07.444]  Well, good.
[02:03:07.444 --> 02:03:11.165]  Were you awake first, Mark, or did your son wake up?
[02:03:11.165 --> 02:03:21.128]  I started in 99, and lost contact, and lo and behold, two years ago I found out he was right in line.
[02:03:23.015 --> 02:03:23.836]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:03:23.836 --> 02:03:24.716]  God bless you, sir.
[02:03:24.716 --> 02:03:29.519]  It's good to know that your son is not psychologically enslaved by the corporate Borg.
[02:03:29.519 --> 02:03:31.721]  Let's talk to Ernie in California.
[02:03:31.721 --> 02:03:33.322]  Ernie, you're on the air.
[02:03:33.322 --> 02:03:34.403]  Hey, Alex.
[02:03:34.403 --> 02:03:38.485]  Hey, every time I go to the store, I try to tell people about aspartame and fluoride.
[02:03:38.485 --> 02:03:41.988]  And if they give me the dumb look, then I tell them the third thing.
[02:03:41.988 --> 02:03:44.309]  Einstein said one thing.
[02:03:44.309 --> 02:03:45.970]  Two things are infinite.
[02:03:45.970 --> 02:03:47.391]  Space and stupidity.
[02:03:47.391 --> 02:03:48.432]  And then I walk away from him.
[02:03:49.056 --> 02:03:51.797]  But the other thing I want to talk about is the web bot.
[02:03:51.797 --> 02:03:58.401]  I don't know if you're interested in that, but it's talking about a possible 1.2 billion dead from Gulf oil spill.
[02:03:58.401 --> 02:04:03.564]  And also, this has been in Book of Revelations, the Hopi prophecy, the seven signs.
[02:04:03.564 --> 02:04:13.349]  Let me see, Edgar Cayce wrote about it, and a few other people, including that shaman that's in Africa with his name, Credo Mutwa, or something like that.
[02:04:13.349 --> 02:04:13.889]  Basically,
[02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:23.048]  I just think early eugenics programs are already into effect big time with this oil spill and I want to get your take on that.
[02:04:23.048 --> 02:04:32.958]  Well I appreciate your call let me come back and give you my take on it but I've known people we've interviewed activists who print up little cards with a couple of fluoride
[02:04:35.322 --> 02:04:47.511]  Websites that have facts on them fluorides deadly and they put it in fluoride water You know containers for kids at the grocery store But now they don't just put aspartame and diet coke and Pepsi.
[02:04:47.511 --> 02:04:50.354]  It's in tens of thousands of products It's in almost all the candy.
[02:04:50.354 --> 02:04:59.421]  So you just go in the grocery store and stick those cards in the candy aisle And you will save people's lives desperate things mean desperate measures
[02:05:00.663 --> 02:05:04.767]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[02:06:02.639 --> 02:06:04.942]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:06:04.942 --> 02:06:08.166]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:06:08.166 --> 02:06:13.272]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:06:13.272 --> 02:06:17.457]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:06:17.757 --> 02:06:20.218]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:06:20.218 --> 02:06:22.659]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:06:22.659 --> 02:06:25.900]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:33.503]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:39.122]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:06:39.122 --> 02:06:42.083]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:06:42.083 --> 02:06:45.785]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:06:45.785 --> 02:06:46.845]  And I got news for you.
[02:06:46.845 --> 02:06:48.186]  You're everyone else.
[02:06:48.186 --> 02:06:49.686]  Invisible Empire.

[02:07:52.432 --> 02:07:52.852]  Thank you!
[02:08:02.668 --> 02:08:09.290]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:18.792]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.792 --> 02:08:23.173]  When you read State Department Memorandum 200 by Henry Kissinger in 73, declassified in 93,
[02:08:27.705 --> 02:08:38.310]  They talk about using wars and famine, and if an African country or Latin American country starts industrializing and becoming wealthy, that they would finance rebels to overthrow the government.
[02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:44.112]  And that if countries wanted their IMF and World Bank loans, they would have to cut their population growth by 50%.
[02:08:44.112 --> 02:08:52.816]  That's just one of many documents, but that's one that's well known, you can look up and read the whole text of.
[02:08:52.816 --> 02:08:52.956]  Now,
[02:08:54.417 --> 02:08:58.028]  People are saying, well, this Gulf thing is the beginning of the eugenics.
[02:08:58.028 --> 02:09:00.334]  And that the oil's gonna kill everybody, basically.
[02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:09.870]  All the eugenics and the soft kill that we've seen, again, soft kill is something that kills you 20 years later, so you don't know what kills you.
[02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:12.011]  You don't know what caused the disease.
[02:09:12.011 --> 02:09:22.954]  You don't understand the underlying chemical or biological precursors or binary systems that mix together to create that degenerative disease.
[02:09:22.954 --> 02:09:29.676]  But the establishment scientists tested on guinea pigs, rats, pigs, and it's almost 100% what affects them will affect us.
[02:09:30.376 --> 02:09:31.437]  The exact same way.
[02:09:31.437 --> 02:09:34.299]  Pigs, guinea pigs, mice, rabbits are similar.
[02:09:34.299 --> 02:09:36.220]  That's why they use them as lab animals.
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:40.304]  And so they've figured all this out, exactly how to soft kill us.
[02:09:40.304 --> 02:09:42.865]  But humans are very resilient, very strong.
[02:09:42.865 --> 02:09:44.126]  We're omnivores.
[02:09:44.126 --> 02:09:46.548]  We're designed to be able to take on a lot of poisons.
[02:09:46.548 --> 02:09:47.849]  We're long-lived.
[02:09:47.849 --> 02:09:48.810]  We're tough.
[02:09:48.810 --> 02:09:51.232]  We're tough as nails.
[02:09:51.232 --> 02:09:52.553]  Okay?
[02:09:52.553 --> 02:09:54.154]  And we're a lot tougher than a rat.
[02:09:54.154 --> 02:09:57.256]  And rats are tough.
[02:09:57.256 --> 02:09:57.937]  Pigs are tough.
[02:09:59.636 --> 02:10:02.477]  And that's just what we're closest to genetically.
[02:10:02.477 --> 02:10:14.739]  Not in our DNA, but in the way our bodies deal with chemicals and toxins is porcine pigs and rodents, but side issue.
[02:10:14.739 --> 02:10:23.901]  The Gulf is the primary ignition device to get the carbon taxes passed that they openly admit even in CNN is to fund the global SDR.
[02:10:25.916 --> 02:10:38.664]  Which is this new UN IMF World Bank, bank-issued cashless money, where they just create tens of trillions, and then your government has to denominate their currencies in that.
[02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:47.109]  That is, your currency is pegged to that and controlled by that, and then you pay taxes to the bankers to give value to the currency.
[02:10:48.447 --> 02:11:02.957]  And it's a debt system where they create more currency and more credit and more debt than there is actual physical money or jobs to pay it back, or it's mathematically impossible to ever get ahead.
[02:11:02.957 --> 02:11:06.179]  And so it's designed to render you down to slaves.
[02:11:06.179 --> 02:11:09.301]  So they've totally enslaved us now with the domestic operation.
[02:11:09.301 --> 02:11:12.002]  They've done it to every country they control, almost every nation.
[02:11:12.002 --> 02:11:15.345]  They're mopping up the few they don't, Russia, North Korea,
[02:11:16.901 --> 02:11:23.482]  Iran, Libya, Somalia, whether those countries are good or bad, the point is they're being taken over by the board.
[02:11:23.482 --> 02:11:25.563]  They're the last to fall.
[02:11:25.563 --> 02:11:32.344]  And now they need the Gulf disaster for it to go on for six months, a year.
[02:11:32.344 --> 02:11:34.224]  They're saying it may go on for two years.
[02:11:34.224 --> 02:11:45.106]  And they need it to not let the big ships that can scoop all the oil up, scoop it up, because then the hurricanes can't blow in and drive it into the estuaries and cause a real crisis and some evacuations to set the precedent.
[02:11:45.746 --> 02:11:56.653]  The President can grandstand as our savior, and they can then say, see, we've got to have carbon taxes, oil's bad, we've got to seize the economy, tell you what type of car you can drive, what type of industry.
[02:11:56.653 --> 02:12:08.180]  Here's an article today, give me a close shot please, gentlemen, from the London Telegraph, and it says, prices rise as New Zealand passes emissions trading scheme.
[02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:13.924]  Petrol and power prices have risen sharply in New Zealand after the government introduced a controversial emissions trading scheme.
[02:12:15.376 --> 02:12:18.058]  And they've gone up massively, it says.
[02:12:18.058 --> 02:12:29.146]  Now, understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the day they passed it, the next week it went up 3 to 5 percent, and it's forecast to go up as much as 20 percent.
[02:12:29.146 --> 02:12:33.549]  Now, we have the newscast where they're not saying it's bad.
[02:12:33.549 --> 02:12:38.192]  They're national news in Australia saying half the land in Australia is now off limits.
[02:12:39.469 --> 02:12:49.182]  By not letting farmers farm on half their land nationwide, and not letting new land be developed, this cuts our carbon credit and Australia gets five billion dollars or whatever.
[02:12:49.182 --> 02:12:51.484]  And it just shows people going, it's over, I'm bankrupt.
[02:12:51.484 --> 02:12:55.650]  And the government's there going, don't worry, we have a program to buy your land at five cents on the dollar.
[02:12:57.626 --> 02:12:59.508]  I mean, this is mafia takeover.
[02:12:59.508 --> 02:13:08.395]  It's like the mafia just lands in, say, East Texas and says, eh, you can't farm no more, and you gotta pay taxes to me now.
[02:13:08.395 --> 02:13:09.876]  It's for the earth.
[02:13:09.876 --> 02:13:10.937]  Oh, you don't like it.
[02:13:10.937 --> 02:13:16.681]  There was an oil spill.
[02:13:16.681 --> 02:13:21.445]  Oh, God help us.
[02:13:21.445 --> 02:13:22.106]  But the caller,
[02:13:24.315 --> 02:13:24.415]  Was
[02:13:44.358 --> 02:13:45.540]  High infant mortality.
[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:46.741]  Babies died a lot.
[02:13:46.741 --> 02:13:47.863]  Women died in childbirth.
[02:13:47.863 --> 02:13:52.809]  You take those statistics out, we're living on average about eight years less than we were, and it'd be even less than that.
[02:13:52.809 --> 02:14:02.221]  They kill you with the soft kill weapons, they weaken you, and then they have all these expensive treatments that the drug companies and others suck all the money out of you at the end of your life with.
[02:14:02.915 --> 02:14:04.897]  So it's all set up.
[02:14:04.897 --> 02:14:16.027]  It's estimated people lived about 61, men 61, women 65 is the number I saw last week by the American Medical Association, if they didn't have all this medicine and all these surgeries and all these drugs.
[02:14:16.027 --> 02:14:18.289]  So they keep you alive like Darth Vader.
[02:14:18.289 --> 02:14:26.236]  They make you sick, then give you Darth Vader prosthesis to keep you alive, and then suck all your wealth that you've made over your life into their coffers.
[02:14:26.536 --> 02:14:27.176]  Alex, great to talk to you.
[02:14:55.834 --> 02:14:57.456]  I had a couple of quick things for you.
[02:14:57.456 --> 02:15:07.943]  I don't know if you'd get a chance to listen to the Financial Cents News Hour, but for the past couple of weeks, people have been calling in and nominating you to debate Matt Simmons on Pete Boyle.
[02:15:07.943 --> 02:15:13.366]  And that's something they talk about there frequently, and I hope they get in touch with you, and I hope you take them up on it.
[02:15:25.894 --> 02:15:27.795]  And we're trying to sort through it all.
[02:15:27.795 --> 02:15:32.197]  It'd be nice if certain people didn't call the office 30, 40, 50 times a day.
[02:15:32.197 --> 02:15:36.658]  We've probably got a hundred people that literally call sometimes 50 times a day.
[02:15:36.658 --> 02:15:38.899]  So we're sorting through all that insanity.
[02:15:38.899 --> 02:15:44.021]  But yes, what's the media request email so I can just give that out specifically?
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:51.062]  Yeah, we'll get that for you.
[02:15:51.062 --> 02:15:52.144]  We're so on top of it.
[02:15:52.144 --> 02:15:56.469]  Something else I wanted to bring up was with this oil spill going on as long as it has.
[02:15:56.469 --> 02:15:59.333]  How come I haven't heard anything about the law of the Sea Treaty?
[02:15:59.333 --> 02:16:02.337]  It sounds like that would be exactly where this is going.
[02:16:03.277 --> 02:16:24.883]  Well actually they've been trying to ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty and this International Gun Grab Treaty to where you pay a tax worldwide to travel on the ocean and even our inland waterways will be under UN control just like in NAFTA and GATT we've given up our trade control or through NATO given up lots of our military control or through these other systems to corporate bodies.
[02:16:25.783 --> 02:16:27.383]  But that's another great point you raised.
[02:16:27.383 --> 02:16:34.084]  They are proposing the carbon tax, which is an international treaty, which does actually tie into the Law of the Sea.
[02:16:34.084 --> 02:16:40.346]  I mean, what does the Law of the Sea and what does a carbon tax have to do with stopping the leak?
[02:16:40.346 --> 02:16:40.886]  Nothing!
[02:16:40.886 --> 02:16:48.207]  But that's what Obama has proposed, and he's blocked foreign ships that could scoop the oil up until it's too late and all that oil comes ashore.
[02:16:48.207 --> 02:16:48.867]  But great points.
[02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:50.007]  Anything else?
[02:16:50.007 --> 02:16:53.768]  You always bring the treaty up first, and then the crisis comes later.
[02:16:53.768 --> 02:16:54.728]  And now we see the crisis.
[02:16:56.249 --> 02:17:04.854]  Um, one other thing I also wanted to say was I think it was two years ago that, uh, right after Bilderberg, uh, John Edwards got burned in the media.
[02:17:04.854 --> 02:17:06.435]  You know, his relationship got outed.
[02:17:06.435 --> 02:17:10.237]  And right now, as soon as Bilderberg let out, I see Al Gore is in the same spot.
[02:17:10.237 --> 02:17:15.920]  I wonder if you have any thoughts on that.
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:18.381]  Continue.
[02:17:18.381 --> 02:17:19.882]  Uh, no, that's all I got for you.
[02:17:19.882 --> 02:17:20.242]  All right.
[02:17:20.242 --> 02:17:21.363]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:21.363 --> 02:17:22.483]  Good to hear from you.
[02:17:22.483 --> 02:17:24.224]  Let's talk to Scott in Washington.
[02:17:24.224 --> 02:17:25.025]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:17:26.445 --> 02:17:45.069]  Yeah, Alex, there's several points, and this has been pissing me off all week, that I'd like to bring up about the former, now departed late Grand Dragon KKK member Robert Byrd, to begin with, and especially to address that caller that left that message on your board.
[02:17:45.069 --> 02:17:55.012]  You know, so-called Mr. Constitution, you know, you may want to remind him that, number one, this is the same guy that also voted for the Patriot Act, number one.
[02:17:55.012 --> 02:17:55.952]  Oh, I forgot about that!
[02:17:56.607 --> 02:17:57.387]  Yeah, he did.
[02:17:57.387 --> 02:18:17.272]  That's number one, so this so-called Patriot stuff, and as far as him talking about the NAACP, listen, black people have been calling them out for the latter part of the 20th century for being the race-pimping and poverty-pimping organization that they are, so that means absolutely nothing.
[02:18:17.272 --> 02:18:26.134]  I will tell you myself, I as a black man, especially, am offended by the way these phony, two-faced white liberals are sitting around here
[02:18:26.661 --> 02:18:28.442]  Crying over this guy.
[02:18:28.442 --> 02:18:29.423]  This is the same guy.
[02:18:29.423 --> 02:18:38.549]  Now they had the nerve to sit there and lambast Rand Paul because of one point of the Civil Rights Act that he might have objected to.
[02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:41.751]  This is the same guy that filibustered it.
[02:18:41.751 --> 02:18:47.775]  And not only that, was not only just a member of the KKK, but a Grand Cyclops.
[02:18:48.297 --> 02:18:52.080]  A recruiter and possible murderer in the KKK.
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:58.146]  Well, he also said that he didn't want blacks to be in the military next to white people.
[02:18:58.146 --> 02:18:58.806]  Exactly.
[02:18:58.806 --> 02:18:59.827]  And you know what happened?
[02:18:59.827 --> 02:19:14.520]  And when I say possible murderer, as far as lynchings in the KKK, you know, you remember when that thing happened with Strom Thurmond, that whole debacle with Trent Locke, that comment that he made after his 100th birthday, and there were a bunch of black Republican
[02:19:15.615 --> 02:19:28.595]  Activists that actually protested Robert Byrd brought up his KKK days and One of the buildings that they said and I don't remember which one it was but Robert Byrd had sent a staffer down there
[02:19:29.693 --> 02:19:32.174]  And this was reported to Newsmax, and this was around 2003.
[02:19:32.174 --> 02:19:33.595]  Stay there!
[02:19:33.595 --> 02:19:35.636]  I want to hear about this when we come back.
[02:19:35.636 --> 02:19:36.717]  Come back and tell us about it.
[02:19:36.717 --> 02:19:38.718]  I don't want to get into a Robert Byrd bashing fest.
[02:19:38.718 --> 02:19:43.540]  I mean, he's dead, 90-something years old, the father of Port Merrill.
[02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:50.084]  He voted for the Patriot Act, and I'm supposed to worship him because the media told West Virginians he represented them.
[02:19:50.084 --> 02:19:51.325]  You know, my issue is,
[02:19:52.225 --> 02:19:56.854]  That I'm against Robert Byrd because he's a globalist.
[02:19:56.854 --> 02:20:00.361]  And he's dead now, so it's a non-issue, but we'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:20:01.852 --> 02:20:03.113]  Global meltdowns.
[02:20:03.113 --> 02:20:04.513]  Massive unemployment.
[02:20:04.513 --> 02:20:05.734]  Endless wars.
[02:20:05.734 --> 02:20:07.374]  A new currency crisis.
[02:20:07.374 --> 02:20:09.455]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:09.455 --> 02:20:11.616]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:11.616 --> 02:20:13.497]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:20:13.497 --> 02:20:15.578]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.

[02:21:01.141 --> 02:21:06.105]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:06.105 --> 02:21:06.885]  What have we got?
[02:21:06.885 --> 02:21:09.547]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:09.547 --> 02:21:10.548]  A republic.
[02:21:10.548 --> 02:21:13.210]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:13.210 --> 02:21:15.472]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:15.472 --> 02:21:17.493]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:17.493 --> 02:21:19.174]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:19.174 --> 02:21:20.495]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:20.495 --> 02:21:21.096]  Children?
[02:21:21.096 --> 02:21:22.217]  Our education?
[02:21:22.217 --> 02:21:23.077]  Our money?
[02:21:23.077 --> 02:21:26.720]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:27.060 --> 02:21:32.042]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:32.042 --> 02:21:33.062]  We have the facts.
[02:21:33.062 --> 02:21:34.223]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:34.223 --> 02:21:35.123]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:35.123 --> 02:21:36.003]  We have common law.
[02:21:36.003 --> 02:21:38.544]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:22:32.027 --> 02:22:36.590]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:42.414]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:42.414 --> 02:22:46.056]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:23:09.133 --> 02:23:13.876]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[02:23:13.876 --> 02:23:15.957]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[02:23:15.957 --> 02:23:17.678]  Made me feel breathless.
[02:23:17.678 --> 02:23:22.121]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[02:23:22.121 --> 02:23:23.202]  Nothing did anything.
[02:23:23.202 --> 02:23:27.185]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[02:23:27.185 --> 02:23:31.307]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[02:23:31.307 --> 02:23:33.949]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:39.392]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month I completely vanished.

[02:24:06.305 --> 02:24:19.997]  She saw her after school Sippin' on a coke Actin' like a fool Crackin' crazy jokes She turned his motor on
[02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:24.971]  Man, his heart was gone.
[02:24:24.971 --> 02:24:27.152]  Fire down below.
[02:24:27.152 --> 02:24:31.373]  He was a Cyclopsian clan member.
[02:24:31.373 --> 02:24:32.973]  Easy as you go.
[02:24:32.973 --> 02:24:36.314]  Easy as you go, Cyclops Brewer.
[02:24:36.314 --> 02:24:39.055]  Senator Byrd.
[02:24:39.055 --> 02:24:45.657]  Say hi to Choron for me when you cross the River Styx.
[02:24:45.657 --> 02:24:47.677]  Okay, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:47.677 --> 02:24:49.698]  Anybody that calls their leaders wizards
[02:24:50.629 --> 02:24:53.250]  Dragons, cyclopses.
[02:24:53.250 --> 02:25:08.054]  It was the founder of the Klan, who was also a Confederate general, who was the head of the Illuminati, Albert Pike, this is on record, who talked about how there'd be three world wars.
[02:25:08.054 --> 02:25:12.215]  The first with the Germans, the second with the Germans, the third starting in the Middle East.
[02:25:12.215 --> 02:25:13.375]  This is on record.
[02:25:14.454 --> 02:25:17.377]  Now, I'm not saying I was against the South in the Civil War.
[02:25:17.377 --> 02:25:18.758]  That was a different thing entirely.
[02:25:18.758 --> 02:25:22.001]  British intelligence came in and manipulated the South into the war.
[02:25:22.001 --> 02:25:23.182]  This is on record.
[02:25:23.182 --> 02:25:24.984]  And manipulated the North into the war.
[02:25:24.984 --> 02:25:28.947]  Then they put British troops in Canada and Toronto and threatened to invade.
[02:25:29.688 --> 02:25:33.911]  So it's not this side's good, that side's good, or this side's good, that side's bad.
[02:25:33.911 --> 02:25:35.453]  It's all sides.
[02:25:35.453 --> 02:25:40.396]  You need to analyze things and not think of it as black and white when you're looking at other globalists or manipulating grips.
[02:25:40.396 --> 02:25:43.539]  But I don't want to get off into these discussions.
[02:25:43.539 --> 02:25:47.742]  It's just that Robert Byrd did vote for the Patriot Act and a lot of other bad stuff.
[02:25:47.742 --> 02:25:49.603]  He voted for some good stuff.
[02:25:49.603 --> 02:25:52.706]  And I think as he got older, you know, he got better.
[02:25:52.706 --> 02:25:57.669]  But, you know, he presided for 60 years over the Senate.
[02:25:58.510 --> 02:26:01.132]  Well, America went to hell in a handbasket.
[02:26:01.132 --> 02:26:08.579]  And so I did get a threatening phone call saying, you better not come to West Virginia, talking about our beloved Birdman.
[02:26:08.579 --> 02:26:11.422]  But I don't like speaking ill of the dead.
[02:26:11.422 --> 02:26:15.686]  So I'm done talking about it, but I don't censor your calls.
[02:26:15.686 --> 02:26:18.508]  So the caller, who are we talking to?
[02:26:18.508 --> 02:26:21.491]  That's right, Scott in Washington.
[02:26:21.491 --> 02:26:22.352]  Scott, finish your point.
[02:26:22.352 --> 02:26:24.834]  We're talking about a Newsmax article about the Birdman.
[02:26:26.147 --> 02:26:40.413]  Well, one of the questions that was asked to him about his activities in the Klan day, and one of them that was asked whether or not he participated in any lynchings back then, and that was the only question that was answered.
[02:26:40.413 --> 02:26:51.398]  The rest of them, the press secretary said that they never discussed it, but this particular one was asked, and apparently Byrd told this press aide to tell the
[02:26:52.242 --> 02:26:52.782]  I don't
[02:27:20.427 --> 02:27:33.213]  Now wait a minute, are you saying that a Grand Cyclopsian Supreme Dragon in one of the most oppressive states at the time, covered with Klan, where there were lynchings all over, might have been involved?
[02:27:33.213 --> 02:27:34.513]  That's ridiculous.
[02:27:34.513 --> 02:27:36.674]  That's like saying water might be wet.
[02:27:36.674 --> 02:27:39.976]  Don't talk bad about the Cyclops, the Cyclopsian ruler.
[02:27:41.747 --> 02:27:45.488]  That's what was quoted in there that he doesn't recall.
[02:27:45.488 --> 02:27:48.469]  That's the vague language that was used.
[02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:54.711]  So, you know, that's when I say, and I don't know for certain whether it's true, but that's why I say possible.
[02:27:54.711 --> 02:28:04.254]  So, you know, I don't like talking ill of the dead either, and I don't really like getting off into this stuff, but, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's no great loss, and
[02:28:04.887 --> 02:28:08.532]  You know, I hope he's burning in hell, but that's my take on it.
[02:28:08.532 --> 02:28:12.677]  So you're not crying yourself to sleep at night right now over a bird?
[02:28:12.677 --> 02:28:13.198]  Hell no.
[02:28:14.713 --> 02:28:16.515]  Okay, I appreciate your call, Scott.
[02:28:16.515 --> 02:28:17.856]  Let me just say this.
[02:28:17.856 --> 02:28:20.619]  Look, the Russians have infiltrated the United States.
[02:28:20.619 --> 02:28:24.944]  Of course they're trying to infiltrate computer companies and brokerage houses in Harvard.
[02:28:24.944 --> 02:28:28.167]  Because that's the corporate group that has hijacked our country.
[02:28:28.167 --> 02:28:31.731]  They're allowed to steal trillions of dollars in plain view and get in no trouble.
[02:28:31.731 --> 02:28:34.754]  Almost every person in the Obama administration is from Harvard.
[02:28:34.754 --> 02:28:36.696]  It's a sickening little crew of crooks.
[02:28:37.932 --> 02:28:39.814]  And I'm not saying you're bad if you have a Harvard degree.
[02:28:39.814 --> 02:28:40.915]  It is a great university.
[02:28:40.915 --> 02:28:46.280]  It's that in the political science area and the law school, it's a bunch of crooks.
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:47.401]  I mean, it's on record.
[02:28:47.401 --> 02:28:52.066]  I've had top PhDs from Harvard on who were taught how to overthrow America.
[02:28:52.066 --> 02:28:54.388]  It's a corporate takeover.
[02:28:54.388 --> 02:28:56.150]  You go, what's it have to do with Byrd?
[02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:57.011]  It's the same thing.
[02:28:57.011 --> 02:28:59.814]  Look, the Klan is almost non-existent in this country.
[02:29:01.297 --> 02:29:12.394]  Back when they had Birth of a Nation, you know, the machete of its time, it was the popular La Raza for white people and it was popular and the corporate media promoted it because there were millions and millions of members.
[02:29:15.987 --> 02:29:18.110]  But now it's a diversion and a distraction.
[02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:29.083]  And Byrd, as corrupt as he was, was in opposition to a lot of what was going on because things are so much more corrupt now, they've surpassed anything he ever did.
[02:29:29.083 --> 02:29:33.788]  So it's kind of like, am I worried about 11 Russian sex operatives or whatever?
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:49.191]  Compared to global banks that have engaged in espionage, it's called globalism, who have bought off treacherous, treasonous Americans, who've taken over our government and are robbing us and raising taxes to pay to themselves.
[02:29:49.191 --> 02:29:51.233]  That's what I'm focused on.
[02:29:51.233 --> 02:29:55.176]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.176 --> 02:29:57.879]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.649 --> 02:30:05.612]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:05.612 --> 02:30:06.613]  What have we got?
[02:30:06.613 --> 02:30:09.054]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:09.054 --> 02:30:10.075]  A republic.
[02:30:10.075 --> 02:30:12.717]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:12.717 --> 02:30:14.978]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:30:14.978 --> 02:30:16.999]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:16.999 --> 02:30:18.680]  So they think they own our land?
[02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:20.001]  They think they own our water?
[02:30:20.001 --> 02:30:20.621]  Children?
[02:30:20.621 --> 02:30:21.722]  Our education?
[02:30:21.722 --> 02:30:22.563]  Our money?
[02:30:22.563 --> 02:30:26.225]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:26.565 --> 02:30:31.552]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:30:31.552 --> 02:30:32.573]  We have the facts.
[02:30:32.573 --> 02:30:33.735]  We have the Constitution.
[02:30:33.735 --> 02:30:34.636]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:34.636 --> 02:30:35.537]  We have common law.
[02:30:35.537 --> 02:30:38.061]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:41.826]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:30:41.926 --> 02:30:46.892]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:30:46.892 --> 02:30:48.393]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:30:48.393 --> 02:30:49.475]  Don't tread on me.
[02:30:49.475 --> 02:30:56.342]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:31:00.447 --> 02:31:04.988]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.988 --> 02:31:05.908]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.908 --> 02:31:09.329]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.329 --> 02:31:10.189]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.189 --> 02:31:15.070]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:15.830]  It's true.
[02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:20.691]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.691 --> 02:31:21.511]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.511 --> 02:31:25.112]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.112 --> 02:31:28.813]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.013 --> 02:31:29.814]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.814 --> 02:31:32.578]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.578 --> 02:31:36.262]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.262 --> 02:31:37.043]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.043 --> 02:31:41.189]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.189 --> 02:31:45.955]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:00.831 --> 02:32:03.854]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:03.854 --> 02:32:09.179]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:09.179 --> 02:32:11.240]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:11.240 --> 02:32:16.245]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:16.245 --> 02:32:17.166]  How much do you want?
[02:32:17.406 --> 02:32:18.527]  When do you want it?
[02:32:18.527 --> 02:32:20.408]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:32:20.408 --> 02:32:21.488]  When will you need it?
[02:32:21.488 --> 02:32:23.689]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:32:23.689 --> 02:32:25.030]  Will there be any food?
[02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:26.551]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:32:26.551 --> 02:32:31.834]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:32:31.834 --> 02:32:35.416]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:32:35.416 --> 02:32:38.878]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:39.238 --> 02:32:40.438]  How much will you need?
[02:32:40.438 --> 02:32:41.358]  We don't know.
[02:32:41.358 --> 02:32:42.459]  How much do you want?
[02:32:42.459 --> 02:32:43.379]  All you can get.
[02:32:43.379 --> 02:32:44.479]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:44.479 --> 02:32:47.540]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:47.540 --> 02:32:48.060]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:49.320]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:50.220]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:29.841]  I don't like Al Gore.
[02:33:29.841 --> 02:33:31.702]  He's always like a big fat rapist to me.
[02:33:31.702 --> 02:33:33.663]  Looks like a giant pervert.
[02:33:33.663 --> 02:33:37.085]  But I don't go off my instincts, though they're always right.
[02:33:37.085 --> 02:33:39.487]  I've got to trust but verify.
[02:33:39.487 --> 02:33:42.008]  And I've listened to the woman's testimony.
[02:33:42.008 --> 02:33:43.629]  We played parts of it.
[02:33:43.629 --> 02:33:48.172]  It's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com since last weekend.
[02:33:48.172 --> 02:33:49.633]  And it's her audio police report.
[02:33:49.633 --> 02:33:51.314]  It's actually hours long.
[02:33:51.314 --> 02:33:55.917]  We put up a version that kind of boils it down to 23 minutes.
[02:33:55.917 --> 02:33:57.378]  But Al Gore
[02:33:58.558 --> 02:33:58.838]  I don't
[02:34:17.171 --> 02:34:34.566]  And she explained it all to him and then of course he started trying to get her stuff and leave and he was running up behind her in the bathrobe, hunching on her without underwear on and doing classic politician stuff of like, I'm not advancing on you and you don't want me to.
[02:34:34.566 --> 02:34:36.808]  That's preposterous as he was hunching on her.
[02:34:37.348 --> 02:34:38.369]  I mean, that's classic.
[02:34:38.369 --> 02:34:42.492]  This is not an assault, like at Waco, as they're ramming the building, pumping gas in.
[02:34:42.492 --> 02:34:44.173]  We're not setting up a world government.
[02:34:44.173 --> 02:34:46.194]  Next on CNN, world government.
[02:34:46.194 --> 02:34:48.916]  The only hope, we'll pay our taxes to them.
[02:34:48.916 --> 02:34:58.523]  I'm not having unwanted sexual advances, as he was chasing her around with an erection, protruding from his bathrobe, according to her.
[02:34:58.523 --> 02:35:01.325]  And it sounds very credible.
[02:35:01.325 --> 02:35:05.468]  And it's very credible that she didn't go file the report for a few months, because she was so freaked out.
[02:35:07.438 --> 02:35:14.762]  I mean, I had a juvenile justice guard try to rape me in a shower, and I threatened him off of me, but I didn't talk about that for years.
[02:35:14.762 --> 02:35:19.445]  I'd probably been on talk radio for a decade before I'd talk about it, because it just sounds embarrassing.
[02:35:19.445 --> 02:35:20.426]  But now I can care less.
[02:35:20.426 --> 02:35:22.107]  I just talk about everything.
[02:35:22.107 --> 02:35:26.289]  But I mean, imagine a woman, Al Gore, who just won the Peace Prize.
[02:35:26.289 --> 02:35:27.190]  He's like God.
[02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:35.455]  ABC News, Portland Police reopened Al Gore sex abuse case, and she says she's got the blue stained dress.
[02:35:36.733 --> 02:35:40.677]  Oh, Al got a little too excited and we're not going to play.
[02:35:40.677 --> 02:35:50.085]  Everybody, if they've got a dog who hadn't castrated, you've seen it kind of get excited on the grass and scooting its hind end around.
[02:35:50.085 --> 02:35:51.206]  That's kind of what Al Gore did.
[02:35:53.519 --> 02:35:54.760]  Reportedly.
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:57.501]  So we'll see about this DNA testing.
[02:35:57.501 --> 02:35:58.502]  I shouldn't be laughing.
[02:35:58.502 --> 02:36:02.104]  I mean, it's a very serious matter to have a vice president involved in this.
[02:36:02.104 --> 02:36:08.408]  It's just, it's so gross, and Al Gore, the man-bear-pig, is so embarrassing and so degenerate.
[02:36:08.408 --> 02:36:10.910]  And this will discredit their global carbon tax.
[02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:20.215]  I mean, they've got their oil spill to push their carbon tax, and they're blocking the aid ships that could have skimmed all this up because they want the hurricanes to bring the oil in.
[02:36:21.736 --> 02:36:27.960]  Use the crisis to get their carbon tax and Al Gore, of course, is one of the main investors in it.
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:30.282]  But this is as big as the oil spill.
[02:36:30.282 --> 02:36:33.304]  They want to use some unrelated oil spill for taxes.
[02:36:33.304 --> 02:36:37.106]  This is going to put an even bigger nail in anthropogenic global warming.
[02:36:37.106 --> 02:36:40.228]  But see, there's a reason they're now reopening the investigation again.
[02:36:40.228 --> 02:36:42.810]  It's because he's not the Nobel Prize winner anymore.
[02:36:42.810 --> 02:36:45.351]  In the court of public opinion, he's a fraud.
[02:36:45.351 --> 02:36:46.572]  He's lost all credibility.
[02:36:46.572 --> 02:36:48.073]  People know he's a joke.
[02:36:48.073 --> 02:36:49.074]  They remember Bill Clinton.
[02:36:51.054 --> 02:36:54.356]  Saying, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[02:36:54.356 --> 02:36:59.818]  They remember all the women that came out who said that Bill Clinton would corner them, rape them, that he liked to bite them.
[02:36:59.818 --> 02:37:04.240]  He would bite them, bite their face to hold them down while he raped them.
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:09.642]  And people remember the interviews of the landlord of one lady, of Jennifer Flowers.
[02:37:09.642 --> 02:37:13.263]  The state police came and broke his legs and almost killed him.
[02:37:13.263 --> 02:37:17.245]  All because he'd videotaped Bill Clinton going in to have a little fun with his Jilly.
[02:37:19.281 --> 02:37:29.049]  And everybody remembers all those rape allegations and the groping allegations and that Clinton got caught lying about it and that he was groping and grabbing women and it seemed like the uglier the more.
[02:37:29.049 --> 02:37:31.371]  And that's actually something with the elite.
[02:37:31.371 --> 02:37:35.015]  They like down syndrome children and they like women who aren't that attractive.
[02:37:35.015 --> 02:37:37.837]  I mean, I wouldn't say this woman's that attractive.
[02:37:37.837 --> 02:37:41.120]  And it seems to be the forcing it on them.
[02:37:43.247 --> 02:37:43.407]  I think?
[02:38:02.355 --> 02:38:06.859]  No, they like to kind of make an old lady beg and plead and not want to have sex with him.
[02:38:06.859 --> 02:38:10.242]  So again, it just fits the whole MO and I believe it happened.
[02:38:10.242 --> 02:38:11.203]  And he's in a lot of trouble.
[02:38:11.203 --> 02:38:14.947]  Of course, his wife's leaving him ahead of all this coming out.
[02:38:14.947 --> 02:38:16.869]  And if you think Tiger Woods was out of control,
[02:38:19.693 --> 02:38:20.714]  He was just red-blooded.
[02:38:20.714 --> 02:38:24.117]  I'm not saying it's good what he did, but he did like attractive, fast women.
[02:38:24.117 --> 02:38:28.041]  There are worse crimes, but rape, or attempted rape, is a crime.
[02:38:28.041 --> 02:38:37.690]  Portland police reopened Al Gore's sex abuse allegations, and claimed former vice president subjected her to unwanted sexual touching in 2006.
[02:38:37.690 --> 02:38:40.333]  I love the way the media spins that.
[02:38:40.333 --> 02:38:41.454]  If you listen to this tape,
[02:38:42.403 --> 02:38:46.164]  If you listen to her police report, and you can hear the police, they're totally buying it.
[02:38:46.164 --> 02:38:47.564]  They totally know she's telling the truth.
[02:38:47.564 --> 02:38:49.884]  Because, I mean, that's what they're trained to be able to pick up on.
[02:38:49.884 --> 02:38:53.525]  In fact, let's just go ahead and play a few minutes of this tape right now.
[02:38:53.525 --> 02:38:58.426]  I'm only going to play a few minutes of it, but let's go ahead and play a few minutes of it.
[02:38:58.426 --> 02:39:03.427]  Again, Portland Police reopened Al Gore sex abuse tape.
[02:39:03.427 --> 02:39:07.208]  And the Chinese national television has also
[02:39:13.388 --> 02:39:16.749]  And of course, we also have the Inquirer cover.
[02:39:16.749 --> 02:39:20.230]  Al Gore is a pervert and sexual predator.
[02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:24.351]  And she told him, stop it, you sex poodle.
[02:39:24.351 --> 02:39:29.992]  She said she tried to nicely get him to stop, but he just kept pushing and pushing and it appeared that's how he liked it.
[02:39:29.992 --> 02:39:32.393]  So she had to escape out of the room.
[02:39:32.393 --> 02:39:35.834]  But again, the reason I know her story is true, there's a lot of factors, was the
[02:39:37.008 --> 02:39:39.390]  You know, repeating, this is not unwanted sexual events.
[02:39:39.390 --> 02:39:40.751]  I am not making it.
[02:39:40.751 --> 02:39:41.811]  This is not happening.
[02:39:41.811 --> 02:39:51.739]  As he was chasing her around, trying to grab her from behind, hunching like a feral dog, you know, does with a chew toy.
[02:39:51.739 --> 02:39:53.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this tape.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:53.900]  Here it is.
[02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:58.864]  I went into much deeper shock as I realized it appeared he was demanding sexual favors.
[02:40:00.262 --> 02:40:01.583]  Or sexual behaviors.
[02:40:01.583 --> 02:40:18.794]  I decided to clarify things by asking him, as he angrily complained that I was not doing what he wanted, for him to show me exactly what he wanted me to do.
[02:40:18.794 --> 02:40:19.694]  Such is where I'm such.
[02:40:19.694 --> 02:40:20.875]  I said, well, why don't you show me?
[02:40:20.875 --> 02:40:23.477]  Because I thought, this is too nuts.
[02:40:24.707 --> 02:40:42.680]  Then he grabbed my right hand hard, shoved it down under the sheet to his pubic hair area, my fingers brushing against his penis, and firmly planted my hand on his pubic crest region and said to me, there, in a very sharp, loud, angry-sounding tone,
[02:40:44.522 --> 02:40:46.723]  This is all happening really fast, as you can imagine.
[02:40:46.723 --> 02:40:48.385]  I thought I was dancing on the edge of a razor.
[02:41:10.811 --> 02:41:14.538]  He angrily raged an accusatory and threatening confrontational tone.
[02:41:14.538 --> 02:41:15.540]  He bellowed at me.
[02:41:18.114 --> 02:41:18.915]  I have no idea.
[02:41:18.915 --> 02:41:20.796]  And I've never had a client yell at me.
[02:41:20.796 --> 02:41:24.118]  Except for one who was brain injured and she was drunk and I work with her all the time.
[02:41:24.118 --> 02:41:24.798]  She's a mess.
[02:41:24.798 --> 02:41:30.802]  But she's like five feet tall and she'll cry.
[02:41:30.802 --> 02:41:34.184]  Okay, so he screamed at me.
[02:41:34.184 --> 02:41:37.506]  He goes, I'm not asking... Imagine yelling.
[02:41:37.506 --> 02:41:40.468]  I'm not asking for you to do anything inappropriate.
[02:41:40.468 --> 02:41:44.010]  To which I replied in a softer, terrified, calming tone.
[02:41:44.010 --> 02:41:46.432]  No impropriety was inferred, sir.
[02:41:48.078 --> 02:41:58.123]  At this point I was realizing just how crazy and serious he was and how precarious my situation was when he said the aforementioned even though he clearly wanted inappropriate touch.
[02:41:58.123 --> 02:42:00.864]  It's like to make your mind go nuts.
[02:42:00.864 --> 02:42:04.326]  He was moaning, groaning, moving, and acting in a very suggestive way.
[02:42:04.326 --> 02:42:05.146]  It was unreal.
[02:42:05.146 --> 02:42:10.969]  I never even had any of my hotel clients get angry, yell, or act out at me before.
[02:42:11.818 --> 02:42:36.660]  During the massage episode I realized much to my horror that I was in the perfect storm and that I was in a room with someone who was Teflon coated in terms of his credibility and celebrity status and my usual safety net idea in all hotel massages before this of being able to escape from such a potential situation of perverted or threatening behavior from a client which would be terminate the massage and leave the room immediately for help from the
[02:42:37.995 --> 02:42:45.958]  The front hotel desk, even running and or shouting for help in the hallway if deemed necessary, was completely worthless in this situation.
[02:42:45.958 --> 02:43:05.127]  It was no longer viable because I feared that if I ran for the door to get out, I could or would be violently accosted by some security detail for seeming to be hostile, inappropriate, insubordinate, or threatening to him, and I feared being tased or shot by them as a first and immediate response.
[02:43:07.188 --> 02:43:16.532]  I also feared that if I made dissent with Gore, I could be in danger of being falsely arrested for false allegations of alleged soliciting or even attempted assault.
[02:43:16.532 --> 02:43:30.498]  In his efforts to do damage control, I felt certain that any, even the smallest, complaint from him to the hotel could also destroy my work-life reputation in all the hotels, and hence do irreparable damage to my livelihood.
[02:43:30.498 --> 02:43:35.500]  Not to mention damage my personal reputation, which I had spent years building with my
[02:43:36.872 --> 02:43:42.294]  I felt very uncertain if I'd be able to get out of the room without being accosted by him anyway at this point.
[02:43:42.294 --> 02:43:46.415]  Does that all make sense to y'all?
[02:43:46.415 --> 02:43:56.638]  He then tried another tactic as though he had very suddenly switched personalities and began in a pleading tone, pleading for release of his second chakra there.
[02:43:56.638 --> 02:43:59.319]  There's so much tension being held.
[02:43:59.319 --> 02:44:05.661]  This was yet another euphemism for sexual activity he was requesting, put cleverly as though it were a spiritual request or something.
[02:44:06.481 --> 02:44:24.786]  I was further deeply shocked and repulsed as my realization of what was happening sunk in, and especially as my mind was now reeling from this absolute betrayal by someone I had inherently trusted as a good guy who cares about people, including me, because of his public persona.
[02:44:24.786 --> 02:44:28.667]  When I came out, he was in his robe and he complimented me on the session.
[02:44:29.657 --> 02:44:34.423]  I felt I could leave without further problems from him but I was wrong in that surmising.
[02:44:34.423 --> 02:44:43.514]  I was freaked out and trying to act calm and collected so as not to look vulnerable and so as to keep any other weirdness from him from happening.
[02:44:43.514 --> 02:44:48.901]  He engaged me in small talk as I headed for my massage table to break it down and he came over to where I was
[02:44:51.596 --> 02:44:54.279]  Well, I was trying to pack up.
[02:44:54.279 --> 02:45:04.207]  And then he wrapped me in an inescapable embrace as I turned around, giving this cum-heather look deep into my eyes and caressed my back and bicep breasts.
[02:45:04.207 --> 02:45:08.491]  I squirmed to try and get out of his grasp, telling him to stop, down several times, and I
[02:45:09.572 --> 02:45:12.793]  Finally told him instead, you're being a crazed sex poodle.
[02:45:12.793 --> 02:45:16.534]  Hoping that he'd realize how weird he was being, yet he persisted.
[02:45:16.534 --> 02:45:20.376]  He was much stronger than me, bigger than me, and insistent.
[02:45:20.376 --> 02:45:22.696]  It was completely unnerving.
[02:45:22.696 --> 02:45:27.558]  And I realized that resistance was making him giggle and pursue more strongly.
[02:45:27.558 --> 02:45:33.940]  And I knew then that this, resistance, was a dangerous tactic to use if I wanted to avoid being raped.
[02:45:34.927 --> 02:45:43.897]  I had the fear that rape would be inevitable if I could not get out of the room, yet I could see no way to immediately leave without it also being a risk to my safety.
[02:45:43.897 --> 02:45:44.538]  Okay.
[02:45:44.538 --> 02:45:48.883]  Because I felt he would use force to counteract... It goes on forever, but we've got the full...
[02:45:50.029 --> 02:45:51.149]  Multi-hour interview.
[02:45:51.149 --> 02:45:52.930]  We've got a 23-minute boil down.
[02:45:52.930 --> 02:45:58.512]  You can go hear this for yourself as he begins chasing her around with an erection.
[02:45:58.512 --> 02:46:05.355]  We don't normally talk about stuff like this on the show, but we've got cops reportedly raping women up at the G20.
[02:46:06.874 --> 02:46:12.236]  We've got the Vice President, the former Vice President reportedly doing this, and it fits his M.O.
[02:46:12.236 --> 02:46:16.278]  to a T. You've got a new police investigation, so we have to play part of it.
[02:46:16.278 --> 02:46:17.418]  It gets too graphic.
[02:46:17.418 --> 02:46:33.104]  I've made the decision not to play anymore of the video because he starts running around with an erection outside of his robe, humping on her as she goes out the door, showing her condoms, saying, why are there condoms in this hotel room?
[02:46:33.104 --> 02:46:35.265]  This is a hotel room that supplies me this.
[02:46:37.386 --> 02:46:45.170]  And I was on a road trip once, and I remember we were like in Nevada somewhere in the middle of nowhere on a college road trip.
[02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:50.092]  And we were sitting around joking in the room, drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.
[02:46:50.092 --> 02:46:52.854]  And we're like, why does it say push here for massage?
[02:46:54.335 --> 02:46:57.997]  And one of the guys jokes and goes, this is Nevada, they probably send a whore to your room.
[02:46:57.997 --> 02:47:00.238]  And later I found out that's what that is.
[02:47:00.238 --> 02:47:09.683]  And so I think Al Gore must check into these super ritzy places and thought he was, because later in the tape he goes, this is Oriental Massage!
[02:47:09.683 --> 02:47:20.388]  And I, you know, in downtown Austin they got places like Midnight Cowboy or, and you know, Oriental Massage, or now they're called Lingerie Modeling.
[02:47:20.388 --> 02:47:23.670]  And I've never been in one, but the word is you get a little,
[02:47:27.056 --> 02:47:30.858]  Well, actually, I probably get four or five massages a year.
[02:47:30.858 --> 02:47:39.642]  And a couple times, and I didn't know what it meant, women giving me massages, and I don't like a man touching me, they would ask, have you ever heard of a happy ending?
[02:47:39.642 --> 02:47:41.343]  And I was like, no.
[02:47:41.343 --> 02:47:46.645]  And one time the lady just laughed, and the next time she described it, and it was like a hint.
[02:47:46.645 --> 02:47:48.166]  Do you want a happy ending, buddy?
[02:47:49.878 --> 02:47:53.740]  And I'm sorry, I am not into prostitutes.
[02:47:53.740 --> 02:48:01.363]  Number one, I'm married and like my wife, love my wife, but there's just something, like I'm not licking toilet bowls.
[02:48:01.363 --> 02:48:05.244]  I'm not licking, what do you call it?
[02:48:05.244 --> 02:48:10.547]  Doorknobs.
[02:48:10.547 --> 02:48:16.929]  And I'm not even looking down on those women or saying they're bad, I'm just scared.
[02:48:16.929 --> 02:48:17.850]  But side issue,
[02:48:19.133 --> 02:48:35.562]  If you put all the pieces together, it's very, very, very clear that Al Gore thought he was ordering a oriental massage, as the code word is, and that she showed up and he was like, look, did you get to work, woman?
[02:48:35.562 --> 02:48:37.463]  I've had a long day.
[02:48:37.463 --> 02:48:39.283]  I'm very stressed.
[02:48:39.283 --> 02:48:44.006]  But the minute she said no, I mean, this was then sexual assault.
[02:48:46.781 --> 02:48:49.764]  And he molested this lady, and I believe it.
[02:48:49.764 --> 02:49:04.397]  And look, Inquirer, people confuse Inquirer of News of the World, because you'll have the Inquirer, and it'll say, government plans to microchip population, and they'll have a real article that I've already seen in the AP a year before, they'll just give it a more shocking headline.
[02:49:04.397 --> 02:49:07.900]  And pretty much everything in the Inquirer, I mean I remember reading in the Inquirer
[02:49:08.988 --> 02:49:12.551]  When I was a little kid, it was like laying in a haircutting place.
[02:49:12.551 --> 02:49:13.272]  I mean, I don't remember.
[02:49:13.272 --> 02:49:15.934]  It was somewhere laying around in a business while I was waiting.
[02:49:15.934 --> 02:49:24.241]  And it said, Schwarzenegger's dad was a Nazi and Schwarzenegger dressed as a Nazi and gave out records of Hitler when he lived in California and would scream down with the blacks.
[02:49:24.801 --> 02:49:29.843]  At the weightlifting gym and said he wanted to be a dictator and all this stuff.
[02:49:29.843 --> 02:49:34.165]  And I thought, oh, this is the Inquirer when I was like 13 years old reading that.
[02:49:34.165 --> 02:49:37.666]  And then later it all came out in mainstream news and it turned out it was true.
[02:49:37.666 --> 02:49:38.947]  It's kind of like John Edwards.
[02:49:38.947 --> 02:49:40.507]  It was the Inquirer that broke all that.
[02:49:40.507 --> 02:49:44.569]  So you'll have the Inquirer that I think is a pretty good investigative journal.
[02:49:44.569 --> 02:49:48.771]  They do give it tabloid type sensational headlines, but this is sensational.
[02:49:49.531 --> 02:49:57.258]  But next to it'll have Bat Boy Lands on White House Lawn or President Meets with Aliens.
[02:49:57.258 --> 02:50:04.004]  And even those publications that are 90% bull, then they'll mix real news in to discredit it, I think.
[02:50:04.004 --> 02:50:06.967]  But I think the National Enquirer is a completely different animal.
[02:50:06.967 --> 02:50:08.668]  I mean, you know, here it is.
[02:50:08.668 --> 02:50:12.812]  Al Gore is a sexual pervert and predator.
[02:50:15.043 --> 02:50:17.825]  So, that is now in the news.
[02:50:17.825 --> 02:50:24.929]  All right, I'm going to come back, go to Frank, Brian, Lauren, Jim, Brian, and others on the other side of this quick break.
[02:50:24.929 --> 02:50:25.790]  We'll continue with calls.
[02:50:25.790 --> 02:50:30.172]  Ron Paul's scheduled to come up in about 40 minutes from now.
[02:50:30.172 --> 02:50:32.894]  And I know I didn't get to your Twitter questions for Jesse Ventura.
[02:50:32.894 --> 02:50:33.635]  I only got to two of them.
[02:50:34.622 --> 02:50:40.007]  But if you've got Twitter questions, there's a good chance I'll end up asking them of Congressman Paul.
[02:50:40.007 --> 02:50:43.229]  So it's Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:50:43.229 --> 02:50:45.151]  Get those tweets into me right now.
[02:50:45.151 --> 02:50:51.056]  Your questions for Congressman Ron Paul at Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:50:51.056 --> 02:50:52.237]  And that is coming up.
[02:50:52.237 --> 02:50:53.558]  But we'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:50:53.558 --> 02:50:58.562]  And I'm going to get into the Gulf, more on the Russian spies, the economy, and a lot more.
[02:50:58.562 --> 02:51:00.044]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:51:01.328 --> 02:51:03.849]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:51:03.849 --> 02:51:07.409]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:51:07.409 --> 02:51:15.891]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:51:15.891 --> 02:51:21.373]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[02:51:21.373 --> 02:51:26.474]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:51:26.994 --> 02:51:35.042]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[02:51:35.042 --> 02:51:40.508]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:51:40.508 --> 02:51:41.709]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:51:42.310 --> 02:51:48.153]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:51:48.153 --> 02:51:51.155]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[02:51:51.155 --> 02:51:54.637]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:51:54.637 --> 02:51:56.799]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence!
[02:52:01.201 --> 02:52:03.583]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.583 --> 02:52:05.805]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.805 --> 02:52:09.127]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.127 --> 02:52:14.232]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.232 --> 02:52:18.415]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.735 --> 02:52:21.197]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.197 --> 02:52:23.960]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:26.883]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.883 --> 02:52:34.490]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.815 --> 02:52:40.096]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.096 --> 02:52:43.057]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.057 --> 02:52:46.737]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.737 --> 02:52:47.818]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.818 --> 02:52:49.158]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.158 --> 02:52:50.638]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:01.195 --> 02:53:04.939]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[02:53:04.939 --> 02:53:06.281]  Think again!
[02:53:06.281 --> 02:53:13.930]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[02:53:13.930 --> 02:53:20.858]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[02:53:21.158 --> 02:53:29.708]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf Cleanup.
[02:53:29.708 --> 02:53:30.829]  Do what NOAA did.
[02:53:30.829 --> 02:53:35.434]  Contact airfiltersandpurifiers.com and ask about the Health Mate Plus.

[02:54:31.247 --> 02:54:40.449]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we have the best, most hard-hitting documentary books, films, Patriot t-shirts, materials to wake folks up.
[02:54:40.449 --> 02:54:46.950]  And that's why the government is moving to shut off the Internet, to shut down free speech, to shut down Campaign for Liberty with Ron Paul.
[02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:49.431]  They don't want Ron Paul to be able to tell you how someone voted.
[02:54:50.131 --> 02:54:55.274]  In America, that's in the FEC, Federal Elections Commission investigation.
[02:54:55.274 --> 02:55:06.180]  I mean, that's how much trouble we're in, but also that shows how effective we are, that the establishment wouldn't be trying to shut us down if it wasn't having an effect on them.
[02:55:06.180 --> 02:55:13.163]  So get the videos, in-game, Invisible Empire, the Obama deception, Fall of the Republic, the t-shirts,
[02:55:14.304 --> 02:55:26.495]  Get them all, wear them, hand them out, put them on AXS TV, get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership, 15 cents a day, download the books, the videos, the material, burn them to disk, give them to everyone you know.
[02:55:27.409 --> 02:55:29.291]  Again, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:55:29.291 --> 02:55:33.694]  We also now have two online video bookstore shopping carts available.
[02:55:33.694 --> 02:55:37.938]  We have the Yahoo cart and we've launched a new cart of our own.
[02:55:37.938 --> 02:55:42.622]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:55:42.622 --> 02:55:45.764]  I love the two new t-shirts.
[02:55:45.764 --> 02:55:53.871]  We've got five new t-shirts total, but the two new ones that have an American flag with barbed wire across it, making up the stripes, and it says Legalize Freedom.
[02:55:53.871 --> 02:55:56.393]  InfoWars.com says the same thing on the back.
[02:55:56.695 --> 02:55:58.126]  And another that shows Uncle Sam as...
[02:55:59.884 --> 02:56:07.029]  A POW MIA, and we've got an In The Fed shirt, and a bunch of new great shirts at Infowars.com.
[02:56:07.029 --> 02:56:17.616]  And they're all meant to get conversations going with people, and so you can meet like-minded people when you go to a tea party, or when you're on the street, or when you're at church, or when you're at work.
[02:56:17.616 --> 02:56:26.943]  LegalizeFreedom, Infowars.com, Uncle Sam behind the POW wire, and you can explain that to people that America has been taken over by a hostile offshore corporate takeover.
[02:56:27.543 --> 02:56:30.646]  And we're in the final phases of our republic being destroyed.
[02:56:30.646 --> 02:56:32.087]  Let's go to Frank in North Carolina.
[02:56:32.087 --> 02:56:32.748]  Frank, you're on the air.
[02:56:32.748 --> 02:56:34.409]  Thanks for holding.
[02:56:34.409 --> 02:56:35.710]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:56:35.710 --> 02:56:39.894]  You've got a reformed Imperial Stormtrooper on the phone here.
[02:56:39.894 --> 02:56:41.455]  Well, good to have you join the rebellion.
[02:56:41.455 --> 02:56:41.876]  Go ahead.
[02:56:41.876 --> 02:56:46.280]  Yeah, I'm in corrupt North Carolina here.
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:47.240]  I was just thinking,
[02:56:48.203 --> 02:56:50.324]  about with regards to Al Gore.
[02:56:50.324 --> 02:56:54.967]  Perhaps the elites have decided to sacrifice him to Moloch.
[02:56:54.967 --> 02:57:02.952]  Maybe they've given the green light on that because, you know, their little plan, their little agenda didn't go so well with the cap and trade.
[02:57:02.952 --> 02:57:05.914]  Well, let me stop you and I'll hold you over because I want to be able to finish your point.
[02:57:07.048 --> 02:57:17.812]  But great minds think alike, and I remember Lord Monckton, not in this interview, but in the last interview, saying he believes they will throw people under the bus.
[02:57:17.812 --> 02:57:20.093]  I said, how do you think they're going to counter us?
[02:57:20.093 --> 02:57:23.554]  And he and others said, well, normally they'll have a sacrifice.
[02:57:23.554 --> 02:57:25.715]  They will destroy someone.
[02:57:25.715 --> 02:57:30.457]  He said, I don't think it will just stop with Professor Jones, one of the ringleaders of the university fraud.
[02:57:30.457 --> 02:57:30.717]  It may
[02:57:31.437 --> 02:57:33.739]  You know, expand from there to even Al Gore.
[02:57:33.739 --> 02:57:39.043]  And then Jaren, during the break, right before I went to you, said, Alex, don't you think they're throwing him under the bus?
[02:57:39.043 --> 02:57:41.085]  Use the same term you used.
[02:57:41.085 --> 02:57:43.386]  Aren't they throwing him under the bus?
[02:57:43.386 --> 02:57:46.249]  And they'll get a new puppet for cap and trade.
[02:57:46.249 --> 02:57:48.911]  And I said, yeah, I'm going to make that point when I go live.
[02:57:48.911 --> 02:57:51.693]  Then I go to you and you say the same thing, Frank.
[02:57:51.693 --> 02:57:57.097]  So, yes, I think, I mean, they knew about this the whole time, but also he's now been discredited.
[02:57:57.097 --> 02:57:57.458]  And so
[02:57:58.058 --> 02:57:58.218]  I think?
[02:58:20.479 --> 02:58:22.360]  She says she's got witnesses as well.
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:24.040]  Stay there, we'll come back to you.
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:30.421]  One minute break, we'll get Frank who says he's a retired or reformed Storm Trooper, maybe current or former police officer.
[02:58:30.421 --> 02:58:33.702]  Then we'll go to Brian, Lauren, Jim, and Brian.
[02:58:33.702 --> 02:58:36.563]  But again, you're not really a rebellion against the Empire.
[02:58:36.563 --> 02:58:43.145]  The Empire overthrew the Republic, so you want the old Republic back.
[02:58:43.145 --> 02:58:45.765]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:53.982 --> 02:59:56.349]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.349 --> 02:59:59.118]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:10.783 --> 03:00:13.726]  Al Gore is a pervert and sexual predator.
[03:00:13.726 --> 03:00:20.332]  ABC News headline, Portland Police reopen Al Gore sex abuse allegations.
[03:00:20.332 --> 03:00:26.737]  Look, I don't think the police want to bust Al Gore, because they know they'll be punished, they'll be persecuted later.
[03:00:26.737 --> 03:00:34.904]  But because this has come out, his wife's leaving him, he's been exposed as a fraud for Climategate, set to make billions of dollars off this fraud himself individually.
[03:00:35.845 --> 03:00:41.126]  This is coming back to the fore now, because Al Gore is seen as weaker.
[03:00:41.126 --> 03:00:48.108]  But if the police really wanted to burn him, they'd be having press conferences, they'd be saying they thought he was guilty.
[03:00:48.108 --> 03:00:49.749]  Who knows what's really going on here?
[03:00:49.749 --> 03:00:56.630]  But this fits Al Gore, and I don't think this woman's sophisticated enough to actually know what an Al Gore would say.
[03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:58.711]  I mean, the way she describes him as he's trying to
[03:00:59.511 --> 03:01:02.792]  Yes, as far as the reformed Imperial Stormtrooper thing, I was referring to my days as a Marine.
[03:01:27.971 --> 03:01:35.300]  I've since woke up from that take on General Smedley Butler's view on the world and the gangsterism and all that.
[03:01:37.793 --> 03:01:39.855]  Well, you couldn't find a better role model for a Marine.
[03:01:39.855 --> 03:01:41.517]  He's the most highly decorated Marine in U.S.
[03:01:41.517 --> 03:01:42.218]  history.
[03:01:42.218 --> 03:01:42.859]  That's pretty hard.
[03:01:42.859 --> 03:01:47.524]  Yeah, he's a two-time recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[03:01:47.524 --> 03:01:50.267]  Hey, I caught Jerry Brownfield yesterday.
[03:01:50.267 --> 03:01:51.549]  I heard the end of his show.
[03:01:51.549 --> 03:01:56.875]  I don't normally listen to his show, but he had a guest on there talking about a book that was written like a hundred years ago called The Coming Battle.
[03:01:57.873 --> 03:02:12.878]  Yes, we've sold that book in the past, we don't anymore, but it was written in 1898 about how the private banks were going to take over America, and how this wasn't a foreign government taking over, it was a new type of threat, a corporate takeover, kind of like the British East India Company took over China.
[03:02:12.878 --> 03:02:15.059]  Yeah, it was fascinating.
[03:02:15.059 --> 03:02:17.039]  I thought I'd heard you speak on it years ago.
[03:02:17.039 --> 03:02:19.100]  By the way, you did wake me up back in 2005.
[03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:24.182]  Can I give a quick review on a product?
[03:02:26.647 --> 03:02:31.169]  I in the mail received something yesterday that I had ordered last week.
[03:02:31.169 --> 03:02:44.316]  I got it within six days, but for those of you patriots out there that have AK-47 style rifles, if you have one of those small little grips and you have a hard time controlling the point name of the weapon, I highly recommend this product by TAPCO.
[03:02:45.229 --> 03:02:50.572]  It's called a SAW M249 style grip.
[03:02:50.572 --> 03:02:59.217]  It's like the grips we used on our M249 light machine guns in the Marines, but it is perfect for the AK-47 setup.
[03:02:59.217 --> 03:03:01.338]  What is it, like a little bar that sticks out on the bottom?
[03:03:02.079 --> 03:03:03.259]  No, well, no, no, no, no.
[03:03:03.259 --> 03:03:08.621]  This is the actual primary pistol grips seated behind the trigger guard.
[03:03:08.621 --> 03:03:13.962]  Oh, because that's also a lot larger and it allows you to get a lot, have a lot more control of the weapon.
[03:03:13.962 --> 03:03:15.282]  It's very ergonomical.
[03:03:15.282 --> 03:03:18.583]  It's just very, very good.
[03:03:18.583 --> 03:03:19.723]  So you like the 7.6239 type rifles?
[03:03:22.639 --> 03:03:25.482]  Yeah, I got rid of my ARs years ago.
[03:03:25.482 --> 03:03:30.066]  I bought into all the propaganda about the 7.62x39mm.
[03:03:30.066 --> 03:03:33.169]  I think it's good for busting things up.
[03:03:33.169 --> 03:03:34.850]  Oh, it certainly is up close.
[03:03:34.850 --> 03:03:39.595]  I mean, if you want something that isn't going to fail on you, there's nothing like the Kalashnikov, is there?
[03:03:40.791 --> 03:03:43.492]  No, no, mine's all black.
[03:03:43.492 --> 03:03:46.973]  But this saw grip has turned it into a completely different weapon.
[03:03:46.973 --> 03:03:49.513]  I mean, it's just such an awesome feel to it.
[03:03:49.513 --> 03:03:54.094]  Is that the one that has the big giant hole in the butt?
[03:03:54.094 --> 03:03:54.935]  Yes, it is.
[03:03:54.935 --> 03:03:58.235]  Yeah, I've got a Bulgarian one with a handle like that.
[03:03:58.235 --> 03:03:58.976]  Very interesting.
[03:03:58.976 --> 03:04:00.116]  It's just like the M249 saw.
[03:04:01.013 --> 03:04:01.814]  Okay.
[03:04:01.814 --> 03:04:05.139]  I'm not really familiar with that, but I'm only familiar with the rifles I've got.
[03:04:05.139 --> 03:04:06.821]  I'll tell you what's a good gun.
[03:04:06.821 --> 03:04:13.169]  I mean, there's a whole lot of great European .308s out there as well.
[03:04:13.169 --> 03:04:14.471]  Hey, listen, thanks for calling in.
[03:04:14.471 --> 03:04:15.172]  Good to hear from you.
[03:04:16.073 --> 03:04:22.238]  Alright, we're going to come back from break and we're going to go to Brian, Lauren, Jim, Brian and others.
[03:04:22.238 --> 03:04:29.104]  I'm going to try to get through those calls at least and then get to some more news on the hurricane coming in, the oil.
[03:04:29.104 --> 03:04:36.110]  I kind of want to recap what's going on because all the time I hear a rebroadcast of my show or I'm on somebody else's show.
[03:04:36.110 --> 03:04:39.652]  I was on Man Cow's show for about 40 minutes this morning.
[03:04:40.868 --> 03:04:47.554]  He was playing news clips where they were admitting that BP created cap-and-trade with Ken Lay and Enron.
[03:04:47.554 --> 03:04:59.305]  And I've talked about that some, but it was just coming home to me how incredible that is, and the fact that BP is the third biggest bankroller of Obama, and the media is acting like he's against BP.
[03:05:02.728 --> 03:05:06.689]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:06.689 --> 03:05:15.552]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:05:15.552 --> 03:05:20.173]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:05:20.173 --> 03:05:30.996]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:05:31.616 --> 03:05:41.145]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[03:06:57.742 --> 03:06:59.483]  This information is too important to wait.
[03:07:00.401 --> 03:07:04.964]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:07:04.964 --> 03:07:05.865]  Number 1.
[03:07:05.865 --> 03:07:09.308]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:09.308 --> 03:07:10.168]  Number 2.
[03:07:10.168 --> 03:07:15.052]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:15.052 --> 03:07:15.792]  It's true.
[03:07:15.792 --> 03:07:20.676]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:20.676 --> 03:07:21.497]  Number 3.
[03:07:21.497 --> 03:07:25.079]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:25.079 --> 03:07:28.782]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:28.982 --> 03:07:29.782]  Number 4.
[03:07:29.782 --> 03:07:32.543]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:32.543 --> 03:07:36.224]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:36.224 --> 03:07:37.004]  Number 5.
[03:07:37.004 --> 03:07:41.145]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:41.145 --> 03:07:46.207]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:07:46.207 --> 03:07:50.388]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:50.388 --> 03:07:52.169]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:52.169 --> 03:07:56.770]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[03:07:57.270 --> 03:07:57.350]  877-327-0365.
[03:07:57.350 --> 03:08:04.153]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.153 --> 03:08:07.575]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:07.575 --> 03:08:23.302]  We're going to get Ron Paul's take on the oil spill.
[03:08:24.847 --> 03:08:32.853]  And on the Federal Elections Commission, witch hunt against him, and of course what's happening, the incredible developments in the economy.
[03:08:32.853 --> 03:08:49.807]  I mean, I cannot stress to you how serious it is to have CNN, the Associated Press, Reuters, everybody saying, oh, the UN says get rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency and have SDRs run by the IMF and World Bank.
[03:08:49.807 --> 03:08:51.248]  I mean, this is world government.
[03:08:51.248 --> 03:08:53.409]  This is total bondage by these crooks.
[03:08:54.324 --> 03:08:54.644]  I think?
[03:09:14.952 --> 03:09:21.535]  That it's $600 trillion that's owed to these bankers.
[03:09:21.535 --> 03:09:24.576]  It's owed because they just made up the money and claim we owe it.
[03:09:24.576 --> 03:09:25.277]  Literally.
[03:09:25.277 --> 03:09:25.957]  It's derivatives.
[03:09:25.957 --> 03:09:27.077]  It's made up.
[03:09:27.077 --> 03:09:29.598]  They're claiming we owe it because they're in control.
[03:09:29.598 --> 03:09:35.641]  And that this allows them to take over the entire industries, economic industries in this country.
[03:09:35.641 --> 03:09:38.282]  The financial industry and anything that affects the economy.
[03:09:41.724 --> 03:09:43.065]  It's a financial dictatorship.
[03:09:43.065 --> 03:09:44.746]  It's giving the Federal Reserve more power.
[03:09:44.746 --> 03:09:49.849]  In fact, guys, I had that article from Friday highlighted, and I looked for it for like 30 minutes this morning.
[03:09:49.849 --> 03:09:51.871]  I can't find it in all my stacks.
[03:09:51.871 --> 03:10:00.756]  If you go search engine, I forget the exact name of the Washington Post article, but it was about the financial reform bill to pass Senate, I believe.
[03:10:00.756 --> 03:10:04.859]  But if you just Google financial reform bill, Washington Post, 600 trillion.
[03:10:06.604 --> 03:10:06.724]  Hey!
[03:10:06.724 --> 03:10:12.749]  I was a victim of childhood vaccination, so I woken up when I went to your website, and that's when I started my website, USWGO Alternative News.
[03:10:12.749 --> 03:10:13.909]  I think you've seen it before.
[03:10:36.806 --> 03:10:38.387]  I wanted to talk a little bit.
[03:10:38.387 --> 03:10:41.651]  I'm going to try to be quick anyways.
[03:10:41.651 --> 03:10:46.777]  I heard about how the FEC is going after Ron Paul and I think it's awful.
[03:10:46.777 --> 03:10:48.659]  It's like Hitler style.
[03:10:48.659 --> 03:10:57.488]  Once they bring in all these snakes into the office and get rid of people like Ron Paul and Rand Paul, they'll have complete control of the Capitol.
[03:10:59.873 --> 03:11:24.333]  Exactly, and most of the snakes in government are CFR, Council on Foreign Relations, that openly writes they want a one world government, openly wants a North American Union, openly wants secret arrest of citizens, openly wants all this tyranny and all these new wars, openly wants weather modification, the CFR calls for that, openly wants cashless society, world government,
[03:11:25.715 --> 03:11:30.017]  And the government's just full of CFR, which is the Corporate Governance Body.
[03:11:30.017 --> 03:11:32.397]  It's full of all these Harvard people.
[03:11:32.397 --> 03:11:34.718]  It's full of all these Goldman Sachs people.
[03:11:34.718 --> 03:11:39.080]  This is a private corporate takeover of our country, and it's happening now.
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:40.540]  I appreciate your call, Brian.
[03:11:40.540 --> 03:11:42.081]  Lauren in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[03:11:42.081 --> 03:11:44.782]  Alex?
[03:11:44.782 --> 03:11:45.362]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:11:45.362 --> 03:11:46.382]  Can you hear me?
[03:11:46.382 --> 03:11:48.703]  Prison Planet, watching on Prison Planet here.
[03:11:48.703 --> 03:11:51.344]  I just wanted to give you an update from the Twin Cities.
[03:11:51.344 --> 03:11:53.605]  I'm a healthcare worker as well, but I'm not striking.
[03:11:54.269 --> 03:11:59.130]  We have, on Tuesday, 12,000 RNs getting ready to strike on Tuesday.
[03:11:59.130 --> 03:12:04.351]  I've got several dozens of videos getting ready to get out there on the strike lines and wake them up.
[03:12:04.351 --> 03:12:07.492]  I urge everyone else to do the same.
[03:12:07.492 --> 03:12:12.153]  Divide and conquer by the Obamacare.
[03:12:12.153 --> 03:12:19.075]  Also, Pioneer Press, June 28th, front page news, new documents reveal
[03:12:20.573 --> 03:12:29.457]  Um, inspectors knew the bridge could collapse, and this is, uh, one of the highly suspicious related to the NAFTA superhighway.
[03:12:29.457 --> 03:12:33.058]  Wanted to get your, uh, comment on that, if any.
[03:12:33.058 --> 03:12:36.860]  And, uh, I know a friend in, uh, transportation.
[03:12:36.860 --> 03:12:43.943]  He just received, he's awake too, he just received a first observer card from Homeland Security.
[03:12:43.943 --> 03:12:47.504]  Italk reports suspicious activities.
[03:12:47.504 --> 03:12:48.965]  Call Homeland Security.
[03:12:49.825 --> 03:12:51.266]  Anyway, that's all I had Alex.
[03:12:51.266 --> 03:12:53.528]  I could get your comments, please.
[03:12:53.528 --> 03:12:55.509]  Well, that's part of InfraGard, of course.
[03:12:55.509 --> 03:12:57.450]  Them getting all their little tattletale cards.
[03:12:57.450 --> 03:13:00.553]  And that would be fine if we didn't have a corrupt government that can't be trusted.
[03:13:00.553 --> 03:13:08.198]  And then, of course, they always start you out looking for Al-Qaeda, but the training then turns into look for gun owners, look for veterans, look for patriots.
[03:13:08.198 --> 03:13:09.499]  They're evil.
[03:13:09.499 --> 03:13:12.601]  But your other question was dealing with what?
[03:13:12.601 --> 03:13:14.242]  I forget now answering the bridge part.
[03:13:15.564 --> 03:13:23.948]  Uh, June 28th, Pioneer Press, new documents reveal inspectors knew the bridge had potential to collapse.
[03:13:23.948 --> 03:13:40.516]  Well, I haven't seen that article, but we all remember the famous Minnesota bridge collapse that became such a big diversion, and then they used that to push for a North American Union, claiming that that would somehow fund new roads, as if more taxes paid to offshore groups would help our country.
[03:13:40.516 --> 03:13:42.977]  But I seem to remember seeing articles about
[03:13:43.877 --> 03:13:44.177]  I'm going
[03:14:00.572 --> 03:14:01.973]  In danger of collapsing.
[03:14:01.973 --> 03:14:24.690]  And so, for them to say that they had reports from the engineers that a bridge could collapse, there are engineers that are good men and women, who are part of highway departments nationwide, who constantly, it turned out, I'm going from memory on this, but filed reports saying, yes, this bridge is in danger, that bridge is in danger, all these bridges are in danger of collapsing, and then they just don't get repaired.
[03:14:24.690 --> 03:14:27.692]  I mean, our railways, when my grandmother,
[03:14:28.613 --> 03:14:29.193]  We're good to go.
[03:14:51.502 --> 03:14:55.207]  The train would get there in less than an hour and get back in less than an hour.
[03:14:55.207 --> 03:14:55.968]  You're talking about 150 miles.
[03:14:55.968 --> 03:14:57.170]  The train went over 100 miles an hour.
[03:14:57.170 --> 03:14:57.891]  This was in the 50s.
[03:15:02.523 --> 03:15:08.669]  Those same rail beds now, you can't go on a train more than 50 miles an hour because they don't repair them.
[03:15:08.669 --> 03:15:11.592]  They don't fix the beds, they don't fix the rails.
[03:15:11.592 --> 03:15:13.374]  Our roads are the same.
[03:15:13.374 --> 03:15:17.217]  You can drive 150 miles an hour on German roads, not here.
[03:15:17.217 --> 03:15:21.882]  Because the money doesn't go to build the roads, it goes to line the pockets of the bankers.
[03:15:21.882 --> 03:15:23.483]  So yes, I have seen the reports.
[03:15:24.504 --> 03:15:32.870]  Not just in Minnesota, I haven't seen that particular one, where they know bridges and trestles everywhere on the verge of collapsing, and they're collapsing all the time.
[03:15:32.870 --> 03:15:33.691]  So I appreciate your call.
[03:15:33.691 --> 03:15:35.472]  Really good points.
[03:15:35.472 --> 03:15:37.493]  Up next here is Jim in Illinois.
[03:15:37.493 --> 03:15:39.295]  Jim, you're on the air.
[03:15:39.295 --> 03:15:40.515]  Hey, Alex.
[03:15:40.515 --> 03:15:41.836]  Hey, buddy.
[03:15:41.836 --> 03:15:49.262]  Yeah, I just wanted to give you my Jim from Illinois checking in for this week.
[03:15:49.262 --> 03:15:51.103]  We have a problem here in Illinois.
[03:15:52.151 --> 03:15:54.752]  About land acquisition.
[03:15:54.752 --> 03:16:08.958]  They're trying to take people's land, um, by eminent domain for a new, um, airport way before the FAA has even approved it.
[03:16:08.958 --> 03:16:09.698]  Okay?
[03:16:09.698 --> 03:16:15.801]  And they want to buy their land at 50% of what it was two years ago.
[03:16:15.801 --> 03:16:21.103]  I just wanted to check in with you with that and, uh, let you know about that.
[03:16:25.336 --> 03:16:28.798]  Well, it just sounds like there's corruption everywhere.
[03:16:28.798 --> 03:16:30.538]  Exactly, you know?
[03:16:30.538 --> 03:16:31.679]  You know?
[03:16:31.679 --> 03:16:34.740]  This is crazy, man.
[03:16:34.740 --> 03:16:37.362]  Well, okay, go ahead.
[03:16:37.362 --> 03:16:39.283]  I'm just saying, just checking in with you, Alex.
[03:16:39.283 --> 03:16:41.964]  You know, this doesn't even make any sense anymore.
[03:16:41.964 --> 03:16:44.225]  I'm a 51-year-old male.
[03:16:44.225 --> 03:16:46.306]  I don't understand anything anymore.
[03:16:46.306 --> 03:16:48.587]  This isn't the country I grew up in.
[03:16:48.587 --> 03:16:51.909]  This isn't the country I saw.
[03:16:51.909 --> 03:16:54.570]  I don't understand anything anymore.
[03:16:57.668 --> 03:16:58.509]  I hear you, my friend.
[03:16:58.509 --> 03:16:59.649]  I appreciate your call.
[03:16:59.649 --> 03:17:02.091]  It's just getting worse and worse.
[03:17:02.091 --> 03:17:04.452]  We have people who don't care about the country and the future.
[03:17:04.452 --> 03:17:08.975]  They care about robbing and getting total power and control now.
[03:17:08.975 --> 03:17:11.077]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[03:17:11.077 --> 03:17:14.139]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Tennessee.
[03:17:14.139 --> 03:17:15.860]  Brian, you're on the air.
[03:17:15.860 --> 03:17:16.340]  Hey, Alex.
[03:17:16.340 --> 03:17:17.161]  How's it going?
[03:17:17.161 --> 03:17:18.902]  Good, sir.
[03:17:18.902 --> 03:17:20.843]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[03:17:20.843 --> 03:17:23.885]  There's a couple of things I want to talk to you about.
[03:17:23.885 --> 03:17:27.147]  Your phrase, corporate takeover, is very adequate.
[03:17:28.597 --> 03:17:37.341]  I did want to ask you a question, something that I heard someone I don't agree with on everything, but I do believe he is correct on a few things.
[03:17:37.341 --> 03:17:48.965]  David Icke said that the Virginia company still owns this quote-unquote country, but they just simply changed their name to the United States.
[03:17:48.965 --> 03:17:52.586]  He wrote that one of his books, A Guide to the Global Conspiracy, is on page 231.
[03:17:52.586 --> 03:17:52.906]  Is that true?
[03:17:56.576 --> 03:17:58.297]  Say that again?
[03:17:58.297 --> 03:18:25.895]  He said that the British Crown that owns the Virginia Company simply changed their name under several pseudonyms, as he says, as U.S., USA, United States of America, Washington, D.C., District of Columbia, etc., and that this country is technically still being run by the Crown.
[03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:37.773]  There's some truth to that, but people also say the United States is a corporation chartered in Delaware, and that's not actually true.
[03:18:37.773 --> 03:18:45.456]  It's a little more sophisticated than that, but deals were made with the British Crown as part of the armistice and in the end of the war.
[03:18:46.676 --> 03:18:52.481]  Where we did sign treaties with England and some of the holdings of British corporations they were allowed to keep.
[03:18:52.481 --> 03:18:54.122]  Most of them they weren't.
[03:18:54.122 --> 03:19:03.289]  But there's no doubt the District of Columbia is now operating as an outside force and it itself has been part of a corporate takeover since 1933.
[03:19:03.289 --> 03:19:11.476]  It was taken over by the Bank of England at that time and the Council on Foreign Relations was established by British intelligence.
[03:19:12.416 --> 03:19:16.099]  So, yes, globalism is just the British Empire by stealth.
[03:19:16.099 --> 03:19:19.742]  Globalization is treason by its very definition.
[03:19:19.742 --> 03:19:23.845]  Meanwhile, they've got us all scared to death of men with turbans or 11 Russian spies.
[03:19:23.845 --> 03:19:27.348]  And, you know, all of that is going on and is, I guess, a threat at some level.
[03:19:27.348 --> 03:19:31.811]  But it's the difference between being shot with a BB gun and being dropped into a meat grinder.
[03:19:31.811 --> 03:19:35.114]  I mean, just the orders of a degree.
[03:19:35.114 --> 03:19:40.058]  It is the British mercantile imperial model that is literally raping and robbing everything.
[03:19:40.896 --> 03:19:41.596]  Exactly.
[03:19:41.596 --> 03:19:51.461]  And another question that I have is that, you know, we have a military that can defend us from foreign invaders, just like most countries have a military.
[03:19:51.461 --> 03:19:54.482]  That's not a, you know, that's pretty straightforward.
[03:19:54.482 --> 03:19:58.824]  How do you, how do you fight a monster like this?
[03:19:58.824 --> 03:19:59.765]  I understand the question.
[03:19:59.765 --> 03:20:00.665]  Let me, let me answer it.
[03:20:01.837 --> 03:20:04.600]  Hi, this is Peter Kronshnabel with MITRE'S Resources.
[03:20:04.600 --> 03:20:09.966]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[03:20:09.966 --> 03:20:12.488]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[03:20:12.488 --> 03:20:15.472]  Are the majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[03:20:15.472 --> 03:20:18.595]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[03:20:18.595 --> 03:20:23.941]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy,
[03:20:24.241 --> 03:20:24.521]  I think?
[03:20:54.781 --> 03:21:03.886]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:21:03.886 --> 03:21:06.267]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:21:06.267 --> 03:21:09.468]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:21:09.468 --> 03:21:14.591]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:21:14.591 --> 03:21:18.773]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:21:19.093 --> 03:21:21.435]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:21:21.435 --> 03:21:23.978]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:21:23.978 --> 03:21:27.241]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:21:27.241 --> 03:21:34.829]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:21:35.174 --> 03:21:40.558]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:21:40.558 --> 03:21:43.420]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:21:43.420 --> 03:21:47.102]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:21:47.102 --> 03:21:48.183]  And I got news for you.
[03:21:48.183 --> 03:21:49.524]  You're everyone else.
[03:21:49.524 --> 03:21:51.005]  Invisible Empire.

[03:23:00.916 --> 03:23:03.938]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:03.938 --> 03:23:09.263]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:09.263 --> 03:23:11.324]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:11.324 --> 03:23:16.329]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:16.329 --> 03:23:17.509]  How much do you want?
[03:23:17.509 --> 03:23:18.630]  When do you want it?
[03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:20.512]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:23:20.512 --> 03:23:21.593]  When will you need it?
[03:23:21.593 --> 03:23:23.795]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:23:23.795 --> 03:23:25.136]  Will there be any food?
[03:23:25.136 --> 03:23:26.657]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:23:26.657 --> 03:23:26.817]  If there
[03:23:26.817 --> 03:23:29.178]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[03:23:29.178 --> 03:23:31.900]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:23:31.900 --> 03:23:35.502]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:23:35.502 --> 03:23:39.305]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:23:39.305 --> 03:23:40.546]  How much will you need?
[03:23:40.546 --> 03:23:41.446]  We don't know.
[03:23:41.446 --> 03:23:42.547]  How much do you want?
[03:23:42.547 --> 03:23:43.487]  All you can get.
[03:23:43.487 --> 03:23:44.248]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:44.568 --> 03:23:47.611]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:23:47.611 --> 03:23:49.852]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:49.852 --> 03:23:50.833]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:24:36.994 --> 03:24:41.724]  Ron Paul is scheduled to be joining us.
[03:24:41.724 --> 03:24:44.029]  Coming up in the next segment, the caller had a great point.
[03:24:44.029 --> 03:24:47.857]  How do you defeat an army that doesn't come openly bearing its standard?
[03:24:49.793 --> 03:25:05.519]  How do you defeat a covert corporate army that comes in and builds takeover mechanisms that are actually businesses, so as they're taking you over, they're making larger and larger profits, so they're financing themselves all the way along.
[03:25:05.519 --> 03:25:08.020]  A microcosm of that is the G20.
[03:25:08.020 --> 03:25:12.762]  Bank heads openly have giant stock in all these private security firms.
[03:25:12.762 --> 03:25:13.603]  They had Canada
[03:25:14.710 --> 03:25:22.096]  Pay tens of millions of dollars to their own security firms and gave them the authorization to arrest protesters.
[03:25:22.096 --> 03:25:25.700]  And now it's come out that they weren't even licensed and there wasn't even a law.
[03:25:25.700 --> 03:25:32.946]  They just lawlessly came in and had private security guns, that's CBC TV today, and grabbed Canadian citizens off the street.
[03:25:35.239 --> 03:25:37.660]  Impersonating officers and the cops don't care.
[03:25:37.660 --> 03:25:39.141]  No one will be charged.
[03:25:39.141 --> 03:25:41.162]  It's all selectively enforced.
[03:25:41.162 --> 03:25:45.044]  Then Charlie Veitch, an activist, jokes and calls himself the love police.
[03:25:45.044 --> 03:25:45.945]  And so they arrest him.
[03:25:47.679 --> 03:25:52.022]  And that's an example of how the corporate government is literally running everything.
[03:25:52.022 --> 03:26:01.728]  As I said earlier, you read these SPP documents and it's the North American Union meeting and you've got the corporate governors there calling all of the shots.
[03:26:01.728 --> 03:26:10.033]  They're there telling the Secretary of State and the other heads of the bureaucracies in Canada, the United States and Mexico what they're going to do.
[03:26:10.033 --> 03:26:12.275]  The corporations will have a vote amongst themselves
[03:26:12.975 --> 03:26:25.859]  And then they will deliver that vote in the meeting to the politicians and then they will swear to develop it extra legislatively, extra judicially through the executive and the bureaucracy.
[03:26:25.859 --> 03:26:32.061]  And you've got the media heads there and they go and then instruct all of their underlings on the policy.
[03:26:32.061 --> 03:26:42.464]  This is an outside corporate looting, just like major corporations got together and went in 150 years ago or so and overthrew China and broke it up in many parts.
[03:26:43.663 --> 03:26:44.063]  That's all.
[03:26:44.063 --> 03:26:50.267]  I mean, it's just kind of like private corporations were operating all over the United States when they were taking it from Native Americans and killing them.
[03:26:50.267 --> 03:26:52.609]  Or the British East India Company in India.
[03:26:52.609 --> 03:26:54.690]  I mean, they would command British armies.
[03:26:54.690 --> 03:26:55.951]  This is a British model.
[03:26:55.951 --> 03:27:10.401]  If you read 200 years ago, the British East India Company, more than 200, in some cases, with huge battles with Maharajas and other leaders that, you know, as they were conquering India, it took them hundreds of years from their ports to build and expand.
[03:27:10.401 --> 03:27:12.682]  And it would be huge British armies, British
[03:27:14.463 --> 03:27:26.929]  And Scottish troops and Indian forces they trained lined up in just huge 3-4 day long battles and the British East India Company would be there commanding those operations.
[03:27:26.929 --> 03:27:28.130]  And that's the New World Order!
[03:27:29.215 --> 03:27:36.337]  And so you go, why is the media telling me about 11 Russian spies and I should, you know, just literally have a heart attack and die?
[03:27:36.337 --> 03:27:38.597]  Why are they telling me about men in turbans that might kill me?
[03:27:38.597 --> 03:27:40.137]  I better give all my rights up.
[03:27:40.137 --> 03:27:44.038]  And then you get the government documents and all the trainings actually for you, the American people.
[03:27:44.038 --> 03:27:49.499]  See, they tell you give up your rights and let a police state unfold to stop the Russkies or stop the Arabs.
[03:27:49.499 --> 03:27:52.020]  And I'm sure if you gave the Russkies
[03:27:52.680 --> 03:27:54.341]  Unlimited power, they would take over.
[03:27:54.341 --> 03:27:56.202]  If you gave the Arabs unlimited power, they would.
[03:27:56.202 --> 03:27:57.563]  That's the nature of humans.
[03:27:57.563 --> 03:28:07.327]  But the group that has taken over, and is raping us, and has created 600 trillion in derivatives, and is doing all of this, is the globalist.
[03:28:07.327 --> 03:28:10.049]  Globalism is tyranny.
[03:28:10.049 --> 03:28:12.190]  Globalism is treachery.
[03:28:12.190 --> 03:28:13.350]  It is treason.
[03:28:13.350 --> 03:28:17.533]  It is a corporate takeover of the United States.
[03:28:17.533 --> 03:28:18.693]  What did Smedley Butler say?
[03:28:18.693 --> 03:28:19.674]  He said, when big U.S.
[03:28:19.674 --> 03:28:21.875]  corporations, which aren't loyal to our country,
[03:28:22.881 --> 03:28:23.061]  He's
[03:28:40.578 --> 03:28:50.461]  Wrapped in the American flag for the very robber barons that had murdered the Indians and were murdering American squatters and people that started their own farms and ranches.
[03:28:50.461 --> 03:28:51.781]  I've looked at the statistics.
[03:28:51.781 --> 03:28:57.603]  There were almost as many white people killed by the railroad operatives and the gold mine operatives as there were Native Americans.
[03:28:58.871 --> 03:29:00.993]  That's corporatism and it's fascism.
[03:29:00.993 --> 03:29:02.755]  It's not free market.
[03:29:02.755 --> 03:29:05.378]  So really nothing new under the sun.
[03:29:05.378 --> 03:29:08.260]  This is a private mercenary army.
[03:29:08.260 --> 03:29:10.202]  Our military, our police, more and more.
[03:29:10.202 --> 03:29:13.746]  The CIA's had a coup of this country decades ago.
[03:29:13.746 --> 03:29:16.329]  And they just completed their takeover when they killed Kennedy.
[03:29:17.253 --> 03:29:28.122]  And we as a society have to make a decision about all of this, and whether or not we're going to let these offshore corporations that are engaged in a hostile corporate overthrow of our republic get away with it.
[03:29:28.122 --> 03:29:35.547]  See, they're getting rid of your due process, your property rights, your Second Amendment, everything that comes with a free society.
[03:29:35.547 --> 03:29:37.389]  So, globalism is death.
[03:29:37.389 --> 03:29:39.250]  Globalism is the end of America.
[03:29:39.250 --> 03:29:40.972]  Globalism is our enemy.
[03:29:40.972 --> 03:29:42.433]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:42.433 --> 03:29:43.854]  Key information straight ahead.
[03:29:43.854 --> 03:29:44.915]  Our site's InfoWars.com.
[03:29:51.485 --> 03:29:55.416]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.416 --> 03:29:58.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.939 --> 03:30:05.122]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:30:05.122 --> 03:30:11.527]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:30:11.527 --> 03:30:18.913]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:30:18.913 --> 03:30:23.796]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:30:32.446 --> 03:30:36.172]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[03:30:36.710 --> 03:30:43.475]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:30:43.475 --> 03:30:47.378]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[03:31:04.781 --> 03:31:06.042]  Tyranny is here.
[03:31:06.042 --> 03:31:09.605]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:31:09.605 --> 03:31:12.387]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:31:12.387 --> 03:31:18.072]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:31:18.072 --> 03:31:24.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:31:24.737 --> 03:31:30.721]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:31:30.721 --> 03:31:34.904]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:31:34.904 --> 03:31:39.187]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:31:39.187 --> 03:31:45.132]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:31:45.132 --> 03:31:48.694]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:31:48.694 --> 03:31:50.675]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:31:50.675 --> 03:31:51.096]  It's here.

[03:32:56.910 --> 03:32:57.671]  Check them out today.
[03:33:15.445 --> 03:33:20.028]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining us.
[03:33:20.028 --> 03:33:23.911]  We're going to have Ron Paul with us until about 55 after today.
[03:33:23.911 --> 03:33:28.054]  Unless the bell rings and he's got to go vote, we appreciate him joining us.
[03:33:28.054 --> 03:33:29.234]  I'm just not going to mince words.
[03:33:29.234 --> 03:33:31.216]  I'm going to go through a laundry list.
[03:33:31.696 --> 03:33:32.176]  I don't think so.
[03:33:54.249 --> 03:33:59.696]  First Amendment statements about disappearing speech that the government finds to be hurtful.
[03:33:59.696 --> 03:34:04.322]  As long as the government feels it's a moral reason they can restrict our speech.
[03:34:04.322 --> 03:34:11.311]  We've got the Federal Election Commission coming after Campaign for Liberty, as you put out your press release yesterday, saying you can't
[03:34:11.972 --> 03:34:17.277]  Well, it's going in the wrong direction, obviously, and that is what I understand about Campaign for Liberty.
[03:34:17.277 --> 03:34:19.759]  They've had somebody at least make a charge and file a complaint.
[03:34:37.085 --> 03:34:41.910]  That there was a violation, but it probably won't hold up.
[03:34:41.910 --> 03:34:42.891]  Hopefully.
[03:34:42.891 --> 03:34:50.458]  But the whole idea that people think they can and harass you and you go through this legal maneuvering because that is the goal of many is to control us.
[03:34:50.458 --> 03:34:52.920]  I think the main goal is also to control the Internet.
[03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:54.322]  They're very interested in that.
[03:34:54.782 --> 03:35:07.621]  The other day we had what sounded like a pretty benign vote, it was under suspension, and that was to praise the idea that government and private entities would study and work together on how to provide cyber security.
[03:35:08.471 --> 03:35:10.912]  And I don't know if there's anybody else that voted against it.
[03:35:10.912 --> 03:35:14.693]  I voted against it just on this principle that we don't need that.
[03:35:14.693 --> 03:35:22.515]  We don't need these private sources cooperating with the government forces in order to have cyber security.
[03:35:22.515 --> 03:35:25.076]  I don't think the government's interested in our security.
[03:35:25.076 --> 03:35:27.157]  They're interested in their security.
[03:35:27.737 --> 03:35:33.021]  But, yes, I think everything is going, especially with this administration, is going in the wrong direction.
[03:35:33.021 --> 03:35:37.183]  And I've always been fearful of them wanting to take over the Internet.
[03:35:37.183 --> 03:35:45.949]  You know, they've now made this announcement that, you know, if necessary, they might even just close down the Internet, which would be devastating to all of us.
[03:35:45.949 --> 03:35:47.590]  Well, that's what Lieberman said on CNN.
[03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:49.571]  He said, China has this power.
[03:35:49.571 --> 03:35:50.172]  We need it.
[03:35:50.172 --> 03:35:55.835]  And I would imagine they'll shut it down a few times, but turn it right back on and say, see, we saved it.
[03:35:58.132 --> 03:36:02.814]  Unfortunately, I'm afraid that could very well happen.
[03:36:02.814 --> 03:36:08.537]  Well, expanding on that, two things, and I want your specific take on this, Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:36:08.537 --> 03:36:10.378]  We appreciate you joining us today.
[03:36:10.378 --> 03:36:25.645]  This shows that we're really having an effect, that they're harassing Campaign for Liberty, that they're openly coming out and saying they want to restrict free speech, put taxes, quote, on conspiracy theories, and Cass Sunstein at the White House, the regulations are said like anthropogenic global warming.
[03:36:25.645 --> 03:36:26.446]  If you deny that,
[03:36:26.866 --> 03:36:28.648]  Maybe we should tax you or fine you.
[03:36:28.648 --> 03:36:39.217]  I mean, the fact that they want to shut us up shows that we're gaining ground, A, and B, doesn't it reveal to everyone just how tyrannical these people really are?
[03:36:40.097 --> 03:36:51.866]  I think it does, and it's a real job to sort all this out, because sometimes people think that all we need are a couple more Republicans and that'll solve the problem, but that's not necessarily the case.
[03:36:51.866 --> 03:36:59.031]  Right now, it's the Democrats who are in charge, and they're the ones who are wanting to radicalize this whole thing.
[03:37:00.833 --> 03:37:11.751]  And we know that that is the agenda of many, you know, in the establishment, and that is more government control and less personal freedom, more taxes, the whole mess that we've been fighting.
[03:37:14.167 --> 03:37:30.531]  I still hold out that the people are waking up and it may well be that the opposition, that is the government, is getting very concerned that the people are becoming alert from all that has been done in the Freedom Movement.
[03:37:33.567 --> 03:37:37.129]  Uh, DeMint reported that 94% of Senate bills are not read.
[03:37:37.129 --> 03:37:38.710]  I know the number in the House is similar.
[03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:43.233]  Uh, and so, 94% of the bills aren't even looked at.
[03:37:43.233 --> 03:37:44.594]  Special interests are writing them.
[03:37:44.594 --> 03:37:47.876]  We've had an offshore corporate coup.
[03:37:47.876 --> 03:37:59.804]  And then, separately, uh, they passed the law in the House, what, two days ago, to not let, quote, special interests tell you how someone is voted months before an election, a restriction of free speech.
[03:38:00.704 --> 03:38:13.030]  So, they're not reading the bills, and they don't want us to know how they voted, and the FEC is trying to keep Campaign for Liberty from being able to tell people how folks voted.
[03:38:13.030 --> 03:38:15.471]  I mean, this really is tyranny.
[03:38:15.471 --> 03:38:23.054]  Well, yes, and they want to make sure that independent organizations and corporations can't spend their money or tell people how they vote.
[03:38:23.792 --> 03:38:35.358]  But, you know, there are corporations, and this is where I think you can fall into the category, because if you run a newspaper or you have a TV show, that's a corporation.
[03:38:35.358 --> 03:38:38.399]  It can be a corporation, but they're not going to regulate them.
[03:38:38.399 --> 03:38:46.543]  So if there is an organization or a political action committee or a private group or corporation who wants to tell people how to vote, no, you might be restricted.
[03:38:46.983 --> 03:38:54.670]  But they never think for a minute they should restrict the media, assuming that the media is always going to be radical left and defend their candidates.
[03:38:54.670 --> 03:39:11.484]  But, you know, there's just a few people on cable and radio and other places that, you know, the way I would understand what they're doing, they still haven't come to trying to regulate what the TV stations are saying or what the radios are saying.
[03:39:12.574 --> 03:39:25.397]  Congressman, going into another very important subject, I almost fell off my chair last Friday when the Washington Post admitted in an article that they're set to pass the financial reform bill.
[03:39:25.397 --> 03:39:28.138]  They admitted there's $600 trillion in derivatives.
[03:39:28.138 --> 03:39:33.879]  They went on, that was the first time I'd seen that in a mainstream publication, to admit that the Federal Reserve is going to have a new
[03:39:34.659 --> 03:39:34.899]  I don't
[03:39:53.149 --> 03:40:06.974]  And that really, out of the crisis, the big mega-banks, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and others created, they are now going to get even more power over the rest of the economy, and that this is an expanded Federal Reserve coup of America.
[03:40:06.974 --> 03:40:08.635]  Can you elaborate on that and give us...
[03:40:09.255 --> 03:40:15.041]  Yeah, and I think you've described it rather well, but that's not the way they claim it is.
[03:40:15.041 --> 03:40:18.444]  You know, they claim, well, this is going to protect the consumers.
[03:40:18.444 --> 03:40:19.986]  It's not run by the Fed.
[03:40:19.986 --> 03:40:24.190]  They don't have authority, but it's going to be in the Federal Reserve.
[03:40:24.190 --> 03:40:26.612]  They do not have control over the policy.
[03:40:26.612 --> 03:40:27.694]  But guess what?
[03:40:27.694 --> 03:40:29.015]  Guess who pays for it?
[03:40:29.015 --> 03:40:30.196]  The Federal Reserve pays.
[03:40:30.196 --> 03:40:31.177]  We're good to go.
[03:40:58.994 --> 03:41:05.360]  I don't know whether you want to talk about it now, but that's where I offered my motion to recommit, dealing with the audit defense bill.
[03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:06.521]  Were you up on that?
[03:41:06.521 --> 03:41:08.723]  No, that's exactly where I wanted to go next.
[03:41:08.723 --> 03:41:12.706]  I wanted to illustrate for listeners that just joined us that Congressman Ron Paul is here.
[03:41:12.706 --> 03:41:17.691]  Twenty-something years ago in Congress, he couldn't get one co-sponsor, and I wanted to make this point.
[03:41:17.691 --> 03:41:20.173]  It seems the House and Senate are schizophrenic.
[03:41:20.173 --> 03:41:21.795]  The House votes by two-thirds.
[03:41:22.775 --> 03:41:43.229]  to pass your bill to truly audit the quasi-governmental banking holding company, the Federal Reserve, that took over in 1913, but then, which is the right thing to do, but it never passed the Senate properly, and then now they're back giving the Federal Reserve even more power outside of government and Congress to regulate themselves.
[03:41:43.229 --> 03:41:44.190]  I mean, this is amazing.
[03:41:44.190 --> 03:41:48.233]  So break that oxymoron down for us and tell us about your new amendment.
[03:41:48.453 --> 03:41:54.814]  Well, it tells you about the hypocrisy of this whole place and how it works and how powerful the Fed is.
[03:41:54.814 --> 03:41:55.354]  You're right.
[03:41:55.354 --> 03:42:02.156]  We passed it in the Financial Services Committee, the Audit the Fed bill, and it was part of the reform package.
[03:42:02.156 --> 03:42:06.717]  Then it came to the House floor and they kept it in, so the House floor supported it.
[03:42:06.717 --> 03:42:09.097]  We have 320 co-sponsors.
[03:42:09.097 --> 03:42:12.098]  Then it goes to the conference with the Senate and they drop it.
[03:42:12.598 --> 03:42:18.222]  They put some things in there to look at the Fed, which are slightly helpful, but they get rid of the true audit.
[03:42:18.222 --> 03:42:21.043]  So when the bill comes back to the House, guess what?
[03:42:21.043 --> 03:42:24.025]  We don't have the audit bill provision in there.
[03:42:24.025 --> 03:42:28.548]  So I was able to offer an amendment, which was a recommitment amendment.
[03:42:29.248 --> 03:42:33.452]  Send it back to committee and put back in the true audit.
[03:42:33.452 --> 03:42:39.057]  And we had an up and down vote on that and we lost it by a significant amount.
[03:42:39.057 --> 03:42:43.060]  320 co-sponsors and we lost it.
[03:42:43.060 --> 03:42:49.526]  114 people who were co-sponsors of this bill switched and voted against the bill that they were co-sponsors of.
[03:42:50.726 --> 03:43:01.013]  And now they've got the feds sicked on Campaign for Liberty and every other organization so that you can't tell the public that they flip-flopped and engaged in treason.
[03:43:01.013 --> 03:43:19.104]  They know that there's been a major political realignment not left or right but towards the Constitution and that all incumbents across the country are either losing or on the verge of losing in the primaries and they are scared to death and they're trying to stop us from being able to communicate to them the truth that
[03:43:19.184 --> 03:43:23.027]  This is treason against our way of government and our life.
[03:43:23.567 --> 03:43:26.870]  I don't think they're going to stop the information from getting out.
[03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:29.992]  It's, you know, the internet is at the moment still too big.
[03:43:29.992 --> 03:43:31.413]  They can't control it.
[03:43:31.413 --> 03:43:41.721]  People are going to find out and they still have access to government records and they can find out who those 114 individuals were who flipped on this boat.
[03:43:41.721 --> 03:43:51.128]  And, you know, if we're worth our salt and this message, this issue is important, you know, it will play a role in the elections this fall.
[03:43:51.800 --> 03:43:57.865]  All right, now I want to rocket through points with Congressman Ron Paul and the time we've got left with him.
[03:43:57.865 --> 03:44:05.191]  The way I read the Supreme Court ruling, it's take two steps forward, two steps back.
[03:44:05.191 --> 03:44:12.418]  The gun grabbers are hailing it as a victory saying, well, at least we've got a Supreme Court ruling saying we can now restrict the Second Amendment under law.
[03:44:13.198 --> 03:44:21.044]  And so basically, if you can jump through a hundred hoops, maybe you can have access to a gun and keep it unloaded in your house.
[03:44:21.044 --> 03:44:28.450]  And so, yeah, Chicago, you can't have a total ban, but you can basically have almost a total ban.
[03:44:28.450 --> 03:44:30.652]  But others are hailing this as a big victory.
[03:44:30.652 --> 03:44:31.773]  Congressman, how do you see it?
[03:44:32.332 --> 03:44:34.153]  Well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
[03:44:34.153 --> 03:44:44.219]  I'm still hoping that it will be, because it's certainly perceived that way, and the people who hate guns and don't believe we should have them, they're hysterical, they're going nuts.
[03:44:44.219 --> 03:44:51.684]  So I'm hopeful that, yes, more people will have guns and more people will be able to defend themselves.
[03:44:51.684 --> 03:44:54.646]  You know, things have improved slightly in Washington.
[03:44:55.386 --> 03:45:18.669]  I hope they've improved even if it's not the total package it will improve slightly in Chicago and then maybe it will be of great benefit to us because what they'll probably find out is that the crime rate will go down as in every other city so I haven't written it off saying that no this won't improve things I think more people are going to have guns in Chicago in order to defend themselves.
[03:45:19.329 --> 03:45:28.772]  Well I agree with you to a certain extent because I don't like having concealed carry because that turns a right into a privilege in states where it's already legal to carry a gun holstered.
[03:45:28.772 --> 03:45:45.177]  But if you pass it in Texas or Florida and the crime rates drop by over 20% in both states, the same numbers in other states, even though it's a restriction to a certain extent, it illustrates that more guns means less crime and so you win the overall intellectual war.
[03:45:45.657 --> 03:45:50.641]  That's a powerful message, and I think more and more people are coming around to that.
[03:45:50.641 --> 03:45:53.043]  And I think, politically, we generally have won this.
[03:45:53.043 --> 03:45:56.686]  They sort of come into some of these regulations through the back door.
[03:45:56.686 --> 03:46:04.672]  You know, in the last several elections, the Democratic candidate usually doesn't go out preaching about how he's going to round up the guns and register guns.
[03:46:04.672 --> 03:46:05.793]  They stay away from that.
[03:46:05.793 --> 03:46:07.935]  They pretend that, well, we're not going to do that.
[03:46:07.935 --> 03:46:08.856]  We're not going to do that.
[03:46:08.856 --> 03:46:12.539]  But backdoor legislation, they generally are always trying to do that.
[03:46:13.715 --> 03:46:16.677]  Let's talk about the oil spill.
[03:46:16.677 --> 03:46:22.541]  And again, just to preface this, BP gave orders that they knew would cause a problem.
[03:46:22.541 --> 03:46:26.703]  It turns out two months before it was leaking, BP is one of the biggest contributors to Obama.
[03:46:26.703 --> 03:46:28.264]  They funded the carbon tax.
[03:46:28.264 --> 03:46:31.787]  They've got a global governance office with a vice president over it.
[03:46:33.007 --> 03:46:37.209]  They've always wanted to nationalize oil so they get an inside deal.
[03:46:37.209 --> 03:46:39.490]  I'm very suspicious of how this has been handled.
[03:46:39.490 --> 03:46:40.930]  We're 70 plus days in.
[03:46:40.930 --> 03:46:47.613]  Obama has blocked a Taiwanese ship that can get half a million barrels a day scooped up.
[03:46:47.613 --> 03:46:50.394]  They've blocked over 30 other mega ships.
[03:46:50.394 --> 03:46:54.636]  Now that the hurricanes are coming in, he's saying he may look at letting them come in.
[03:46:54.636 --> 03:46:58.957]  Once that oil gets blown in, they're going to have a major disaster.
[03:46:58.957 --> 03:47:00.778]  The Washington Post is talking about forced
[03:47:02.299 --> 03:47:05.521]  Obama's answer is give me the carbon tax.
[03:47:05.521 --> 03:47:08.763]  Rahm Emanuel said don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[03:47:08.763 --> 03:47:13.426]  I don't see this as Obama versus BP as the media has phrased it.
[03:47:13.426 --> 03:47:18.929]  Really, this is Obama working with BP to try to get his carbon tax.
[03:47:18.929 --> 03:47:21.891]  Congressman, this is out in international water.
[03:47:21.891 --> 03:47:24.433]  Why don't we just have the salvagers in there to begin with?
[03:47:24.433 --> 03:47:27.655]  How can Obama tell people 50 miles out in the Gulf what to do?
[03:47:28.186 --> 03:47:29.227]  No, you forgot.
[03:47:29.227 --> 03:47:30.728]  He can write executive orders.
[03:47:30.728 --> 03:47:36.292]  Executive orders to do anything they want.
[03:47:36.292 --> 03:47:37.533]  It is a real mess.
[03:47:37.533 --> 03:47:43.517]  You know, if a state needs some manpower, generally they don't have manpower that might be able to help out.
[03:47:43.517 --> 03:47:45.679]  That would be maybe their National Guard units.
[03:47:45.959 --> 03:47:49.400]  They're all over in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[03:47:49.400 --> 03:47:55.422]  I would say that, you know, if an emergency like this, this might be an incentive to say, hey, why don't you bring these troops home?
[03:47:55.422 --> 03:47:59.963]  And maybe even some different states would share some of their people to help.
[03:47:59.963 --> 03:48:03.184]  I mean, it's practically like an invasion, the way this oil is coming in.
[03:48:04.464 --> 03:48:23.097]  But I think that, yes, I'm very suspicious of what BP and our government is doing and the Obama administration, and that's why I've even challenged the principle of this agreement they have to set up this fund, this $20 billion fund.
[03:48:23.097 --> 03:48:27.040]  Sounds like a lot of money, but it sounds like there could be a lot of mischief, too.
[03:48:27.740 --> 03:48:29.962]  Yeah, I saw a report that they're blocking... I'm sorry to interrupt.
[03:48:29.962 --> 03:48:33.745]  I saw a report in the AP yesterday they're trying to block Republican groups from going and looking at the Gulf.
[03:48:33.745 --> 03:48:34.926]  I mean, Obama doesn't have that power.
[03:48:51.297 --> 03:48:53.280]  Yeah, well, he might take it.
[03:48:53.280 --> 03:48:59.691]  He doesn't deserve that power, but sometimes they assume power that they have, but just, you know, no, he doesn't.
[03:48:59.691 --> 03:49:01.574]  That's not a proper power that he has.
[03:49:05.364 --> 03:49:13.809]  I'm not too pleased either, and I think, you know, a BP corporation is in bed with government, so you have to be suspect.
[03:49:13.809 --> 03:49:18.732]  Just think of how much we spend protecting their oil well and their oil drilling.
[03:49:18.732 --> 03:49:20.533]  What do you think we're over in the Middle East for?
[03:49:20.533 --> 03:49:22.815]  We're not over there to spread democracy.
[03:49:22.815 --> 03:49:28.278]  We're over there to protect oil companies, and BP just happens to be over there as well.
[03:49:29.754 --> 03:49:30.835]  Did you see the video?
[03:49:30.835 --> 03:49:35.339]  You probably didn't two weeks ago, but it was on Drudge and Infowars.com and everywhere else.
[03:49:35.339 --> 03:49:50.512]  Senator Kyle said he was in a closed-door meeting with Obama and said, look, tens of thousands dead, 80 miles to 100 miles, illegal aliens, they're shutting down national parks, the border's collapsing, Mexico's collapsed, and Obama said, I'm not going to fix the border until you pass amnesty.
[03:49:50.512 --> 03:49:51.873]  I need to use that crisis.
[03:49:51.873 --> 03:49:53.074]  This is a quote.
[03:49:53.074 --> 03:49:56.457]  And Senator Kyle said that this is basically
[03:49:57.017 --> 03:49:59.579]  Holding us hostage in a form of terrorism.
[03:49:59.579 --> 03:50:02.621]  I mean, that sounds like an impeachable offense, Congressman.
[03:50:02.621 --> 03:50:05.562]  And to have a senator say he was in a meeting with Obama.
[03:50:05.562 --> 03:50:07.303]  A, what's your take on that?
[03:50:07.303 --> 03:50:15.248]  And B, I mean, that is a false flag to let the crime continue and not protect our border when that's in the Constitution.
[03:50:15.248 --> 03:50:16.609]  One of the few duties of the feds.
[03:50:16.609 --> 03:50:17.450]  What would you say to that?
[03:50:18.257 --> 03:50:21.899]  Well, since I wasn't at that meeting and exactly what I said, I don't know.
[03:50:21.899 --> 03:50:26.201]  So it would have to be up to the Senator to decide what to do with it.
[03:50:26.201 --> 03:50:31.983]  But they certainly don't act like they have an incentive to do much with the borders.
[03:50:31.983 --> 03:50:37.146]  And that, of course, could eventually lead to a national security problem as well.
[03:50:37.594 --> 03:50:41.615]  Well, okay, Congressman Ron Paul, what about his executive order?
[03:50:41.615 --> 03:50:51.837]  And now they say they're going to sue Arizona, and they're saying Arizona isn't allowed to protect itself when a third of the state is now being denied to the citizens.
[03:50:51.837 --> 03:50:54.018]  I mean, this is confirmed.
[03:50:54.018 --> 03:51:00.379]  What's your view on the constitutionality of an executive order by the president to legalize the illegals?
[03:51:01.946 --> 03:51:04.752]  Well, he can't do it unilaterally like that.
[03:51:04.752 --> 03:51:09.421]  No, Congress would have to act and take a policy on that and write the rules.
[03:51:09.421 --> 03:51:12.887]  The federal government has authority over our borders.
[03:51:13.539 --> 03:51:22.063]  But, you know, it should be that the private landowners should have a lot of authority, along with the states themselves with jurisdiction.
[03:51:22.063 --> 03:51:33.369]  And yet, instead of permitting them to exert their authority over their own land, whether it's their own private or the state, the federal government comes in and says, you can't do it.
[03:51:33.369 --> 03:51:37.431]  So they're acting perversely to what I think the federal government ought to be doing.
[03:51:38.584 --> 03:51:57.180]  Congressman, I know you're a busy man, but have you had a chance to watch Kagan and the hearings, and then expanding on that, all of her open statements about socialism being great and the government can disappear speech, going back to that, are you concerned about Kagan?
[03:51:57.180 --> 03:52:03.085]  Oh, I am, but I'm sure if he put ten new ones up in place of her, I'd be very concerned too.
[03:52:03.085 --> 03:52:05.667]  I haven't watched the hearings, but I've read about her.
[03:52:06.518 --> 03:52:18.840]  And she certainly is not going to be a great defender of the Constitution, although she's going to make it sound like she is, so I'm not too encouraged with that appointment for sure.
[03:52:20.287 --> 03:52:23.970]  Congressman, what's your take on the Russian spy situation?
[03:52:23.970 --> 03:52:27.152]  It seems like they're trying to kick off a new Cold War with that.
[03:52:27.152 --> 03:52:31.335]  And my issue is, globalization is treason.
[03:52:31.335 --> 03:52:35.898]  Globalization is corporations and megabanks taking over our government.
[03:52:35.898 --> 03:52:43.243]  And so what is the difference between Russian spies sneaking around and megacorporations coming in and openly buying off our politicians?
[03:52:44.403 --> 03:52:47.284]  Yeah, I think this is a little bit of hype.
[03:52:47.284 --> 03:52:54.206]  I think even the media, the mainstream media is sort of making fun of all this, and I think rightfully so.
[03:52:54.206 --> 03:52:57.167]  They just didn't look like a great threat to me.
[03:52:57.167 --> 03:53:04.950]  And I had somebody in for a luncheon today that was sort of knowledgeable about this, and he said that
[03:53:05.535 --> 03:53:08.477]  He said that there's a lot of spying going on in the world.
[03:53:08.477 --> 03:53:18.443]  Other countries come in here, they do it routinely, and we're all over the place, all over the world, and it's almost, he described it almost like a game they play.
[03:53:18.443 --> 03:53:27.268]  I mean, it's really not serious intrigue, and my guess is that people like to stir things up, scare the people, and who knows?
[03:53:27.268 --> 03:53:30.050]  I hope it doesn't lead to another Cold War with the Russians.
[03:53:30.050 --> 03:53:35.053]  I don't think they're looking for trouble, and we certainly shouldn't be looking for it either.
[03:53:35.473 --> 03:53:37.614]  Alright, Congressman Ron Paul, we appreciate your time.
[03:53:37.614 --> 03:53:43.858]  In closing, and I know you'll say, well, if I was president, I would only have the powers of the president, but what would you recommend?
[03:53:43.858 --> 03:53:44.678]  What would you do?
[03:53:44.678 --> 03:53:57.826]  If Ron Paul would have been elected back in 2008, as we all wish you would have been, forecasting everything that's now happened, if you would have been elected, what would you have done with the oil spill, and what would you be doing now?
[03:53:59.002 --> 03:54:02.463]  I'd probably work at getting the government out of the way.
[03:54:02.463 --> 03:54:09.567]  I would have done everything possible to alleviate any federal restrictions on the state or property owners.
[03:54:09.567 --> 03:54:14.609]  I would have accepted anybody who had an offer to come in and help.
[03:54:14.609 --> 03:54:19.331]  I would have worked to remove any liability limitations on BP.
[03:54:23.110 --> 03:54:36.780]  And I would have, of course, by the time we had the oil spill, I would have had all the guard units back in the individual states, and they would have had the right to use their guard units as they pleased.
[03:54:36.780 --> 03:54:45.185]  And I would actually encourage other guard units and not pretend the guard units belong to the President, but they belong to the states and the government.
[03:54:45.185 --> 03:54:49.548]  And I think they could have done a lot to alleviate some of the damage.
[03:54:50.849 --> 03:54:58.476]  I do not believe that there would have been any magic with any one individual who said, oh, I know how to cap this thing, let me do it.
[03:54:58.476 --> 03:55:02.580]  I actually do believe they're trying seriously to stop this.
[03:55:02.580 --> 03:55:05.042]  I don't think it serves anybody's benefit.
[03:55:05.042 --> 03:55:09.666]  But I think right now the assumption is that the government
[03:55:10.126 --> 03:55:10.767]  We're good to go.
[03:55:29.011 --> 03:55:35.097]  Well, the Russians and the Chinese and the people in Brazil, they're not stopping drilling in the Gulf.
[03:55:35.097 --> 03:55:36.198]  We don't own the Gulf.
[03:55:36.198 --> 03:55:38.640]  He's just stopped any companies in the U.S.
[03:55:38.640 --> 03:55:43.044]  I mean, this is outrageous, and they're going to use it to pass cap-and-trade.
[03:55:43.044 --> 03:55:45.947]  Congressman Ron Paul, everybody's got to get behind Campaign for Liberty.
[03:55:45.947 --> 03:55:47.668]  They've got to get behind Rand Paul.
[03:55:47.668 --> 03:55:53.634]  We're going to win this, and we appreciate your leadership, and we know you're there working tirelessly for us in Congress.
[03:55:53.634 --> 03:55:54.375]  God bless you, sir.
[03:55:55.635 --> 03:55:56.495]  All right, bye-bye.
[03:55:56.495 --> 03:55:58.817]  There goes Congressman Ron Paul, and we are out of time.
[03:55:58.817 --> 03:56:00.518]  No more time for calls.
[03:56:00.518 --> 03:56:04.640]  I got to most of the news today, and I want to say great job to the crew.
[03:56:04.640 --> 03:56:10.883]  I also want to encourage listeners to support the online video, bookstore, shopping cart at infowars.com.
[03:56:11.403 --> 03:56:13.964]  We're not funded by the New World Order or big global corporations.
[03:56:13.964 --> 03:56:18.725]  We're funded by small sponsors and by you buying the books, the t-shirts, the videos.
[03:56:18.725 --> 03:56:26.787]  Got a lot of new books and videos and specials and free t-shirt deals up on Infowars.com or you can always call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:56:26.787 --> 03:56:34.269]  We've got some other very informative guests joining us tomorrow and next week, of course, steaming towards the 4th of July.
[03:56:34.269 --> 03:56:38.370]  I hope everyone will remember what the 4th of July is really all about.
[03:56:39.210 --> 03:56:43.253]  And at the end here, I wanted to thank Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:56:43.253 --> 03:56:44.554]  Just a wonderful sponsor.
[03:56:44.554 --> 03:56:45.735]  And you really need to listen to me.
[03:56:45.735 --> 03:56:53.281]  I search high and low because I like green energy foods that are just raw foods, you know, that aren't pasteurized, that haven't lost their value.
[03:56:53.281 --> 03:56:54.422]  This is the best out there.
[03:56:54.422 --> 03:56:55.863]  And of course, it's owned by Patriots.
[03:56:56.684 --> 03:56:57.946]  And it's very affordable.
[03:56:57.946 --> 03:57:01.069]  It has 20 organic superfood ingredients in it.
[03:57:01.069 --> 03:57:05.654]  It won the 2009 Superfood for Mike Adams, the Health Ranger Award.
[03:57:05.654 --> 03:57:09.399]  They have their Nutri-Cafe coffee, but really their inner food is their classic.
[03:57:09.399 --> 03:57:12.662]  They got a lot of great products, all made right here in the USA.
[03:57:13.323 --> 03:57:22.008]  And it's just raw foods, concentrated, and it's just a few scoops in the morning with your orange juice or apple juice or with water or coconut juice, whatever you like.
[03:57:22.008 --> 03:57:24.989]  Innerfood, E-N-E-R food, innerfood.com, E-N-E-R food.com, or 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, innerfood.com.
[03:57:24.989 --> 03:57:26.950]  And lastly, it's not enough to just own guns.
[03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:28.311]  You need to know how to use guns.
[03:57:39.557 --> 03:57:46.867]  They've had this great deal for a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice, with one of their basic training packages.
[03:57:46.867 --> 03:57:48.569]  And believe me, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:57:48.569 --> 03:57:51.653]  No drill instructor, no tough guy attitude, the best training out there.
[03:57:51.653 --> 03:57:53.976]  I heard about these guys a decade ago.
[03:57:53.976 --> 03:57:57.440]  I mean, with police and military, I know, that go there to tune themselves up.
[03:57:58.322 --> 03:57:59.764]  It is FrontSight.com.
[03:57:59.764 --> 03:58:01.286]  Front Sight Firearms Training.
[03:58:01.286 --> 03:58:02.647]  FrontSight.com.
[03:58:02.647 --> 03:58:05.351]  Go to FrontSight.com for your free training and free gun.
[03:58:05.351 --> 03:58:07.374]  Learn more at FrontSight.com.

[03:58:09.156 --> 03:58:12.080]  Like the front of your rifle, FrontSight.com.
[03:58:12.080 --> 03:58:15.304]  And just in closing, again, the broadcast is exploding.
[03:58:16.912 --> 03:58:18.632]  More and more people are tuning in.
[03:58:18.632 --> 03:58:21.573]  You are the reason we're getting on so many AM and FM stations.
[03:58:21.573 --> 03:58:28.234]  You are the reason so many people are downloading the free MP3 podcast every day and sharing it, and the free iPhone app.
[03:58:28.234 --> 03:58:30.275]  Listen where you want, when you want.
[03:58:30.275 --> 03:58:35.656]  We've got the free app too for the Android out there listed on the listen page.
[03:58:35.656 --> 03:58:37.596]  All of it's at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:37.596 --> 03:58:39.337]  Got some big news breaking tomorrow.
[03:58:39.337 --> 03:58:40.697]  Be sure and join us at 11am.
[03:58:40.697 --> 03:58:41.037]  God bless.
