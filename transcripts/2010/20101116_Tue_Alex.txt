[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.274]  We're going to cover the stock markets plunging around the world on fears of dollar devaluation.
[00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:28.858]  We're going to break down the police state in this country.
[00:00:28.918 --> 00:00:32.841]  They're now trying to pass legislation to ban family farms and ranches.
[00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:39.946]  You'll have to have special government license to even grow tomatoes or plums in your backyard.
[00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:45.450]  Natural News is reporting they're very, very close to getting that rammed through right now.
[00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.571]  That is all coming up.
[00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:51.194]  But we're going to continue discussing now into week number three.
[00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:52.736]  Week number three is almost
[00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:54.117]  Gone.
[00:00:54.137 --> 00:01:00.021]  And we've been covering this going back three weeks ago, from Wednesday of three weeks ago.
[00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:07.727]  We're going to continue hammering this drum of the TSA takeover of society.
[00:01:07.747 --> 00:01:09.509]  We're going to continue pointing this out.
[00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.915]  Because the TSA is federalizing society.
[00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:23.083]  They are giving us training to have the government put their hands on us to condition us that we're all basically prisoners.
[00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:28.488]  And if they can get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.295]  It's also a lesson in brazen government bullying and intimidation.
[00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:49.602]  We have joining us in about 30 minutes, John Tyner, whose video and audio that was posted Sunday has gone viral with millions of views online.
[00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:54.385]  He was trying to fly out of Southern California to go pheasant hunting on the East Coast.
[00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:59.789]  And he said, look, you're not going to touch my private parts.
[00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.090]  And so they said, well, you can leave then.
[00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.111]  So he did try to leave.
[00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:07.613]  And they said, no, now we're going to fine you for leaving the screening area civilly.
[00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:08.733]  It's all civil.
[00:02:08.773 --> 00:02:09.874]  It's all color of law.
[00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:11.434]  That's how they get away with this.
[00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.456]  And so they've been caught trying to frame him now.
[00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:16.737]  So he's going to be joining us.
[00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:18.818]  But all of that is now dwarfed.
[00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:31.778]  By the top story that's up on the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com, we have our own report on this going up at PrisonPlanet.com in the next few minutes by Steve Watson that's got some different angles to it.
[00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.120]  But TSAXXX naked body scans leak online.
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.602]  Well, the issue is we already had this happen earlier this year in England when a TV star was going through and they wanted to
[00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.990]  Have him sign a print off of his naked body.
[00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:57.633]  The women, British airport screeners did.
[00:02:57.713 --> 00:02:59.193]  It's very similar to RTSA.
[00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:05.516]  Well now, 100 naked citizens, 100 leaked body scans.
[00:03:06.137 --> 00:03:08.498]  Now this is a less powerful system.
[00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:21.047]  Though it is revealing that they use, at this particular courthouse, federal courthouse in Florida, where they save the 35,000 images.
[00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:31.913]  And I believe this looks like a PSYOP, because I've seen the images in the test models from even this system they're using, and it's more detailed than what they've released here.
[00:03:32.494 --> 00:03:38.017]  So they're putting this out, they're not saying who leaked it, saying, oh my gosh, it shows the naked citizens.
[00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:42.118]  Uh, but this is nothing compared to the airport, uh, scanners.
[00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.498]  But this is from Gizmodo.
[00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.459]  And again, it's linked up on Drudge Report.
[00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:52.421]  The Gizmodo investigation has revealed 100 of the photographs saved by the Gen 2 millimeter wave scanner.
[00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.781]  Now see, the airports have an actual x-ray.
[00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.162]  Uh, from the...
[00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.390]  We're good to go.
[00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:26.217]  Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security, running around writing news articles, press releases for USA Today.
[00:04:27.457 --> 00:04:37.043]  We've got her doing press conferences saying we do not save the images when the manuals for the machines that we published over a year ago state they do save the images.
[00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:39.264]  So they are saving the images.
[00:04:39.724 --> 00:04:41.806]  The machines do save the images.
[00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:46.088]  But there's an even bigger development when we come back.
[00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.410]  But overall,
[00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:50.570]  The globalists are in trouble.
[00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.231]  The people are learning how to stand up and take action.
[00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.132]  That's scaring the system.
[00:04:55.473 --> 00:04:58.775]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:00.116]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:05:00.176 --> 00:05:04.538]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:10.402]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:12.663]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:05:12.843 --> 00:05:15.505]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:22.168]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.170]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.652]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:34.895]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:40.398]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:43.500]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.102]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:05:49.003 --> 00:05:54.046]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:05:55.206 --> 00:06:00.669]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.612]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:07.013 --> 00:06:08.954]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:06:11.092 --> 00:06:21.928]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:06:33.878 --> 00:06:35.759]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.845]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:17.787]  The all-out revolt against the naked body scanners and the invasive molestation fondling broke downs is intensifying.
[00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:23.690]  Time Magazine has a headline saying everybody hates the TSA.
[00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:27.592]  Well, almost everyone had always hated it.
[00:08:28.598 --> 00:08:31.920]  And I'm going to get into the big new developments on that front here in a moment.
[00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:35.283]  In fact, I told the story many times of five years ago.
[00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:50.132]  I was down at a local TV station visiting with a friend and his brother is a senior person in security at the Bergstrom International Airport here in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:51.173 --> 00:08:58.235]  And his brother was there and they were in their office sitting around giggling and laughing.
[00:08:58.275 --> 00:09:02.276]  He was in his brother's office saying, wait, wait, it's about to come on.
[00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:04.257]  And I said, what's about to come on?
[00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:07.358]  And he said, News 8 Austin.
[00:09:08.038 --> 00:09:12.980]  He said, he said, we've added more security and everybody hates it.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.921]  But he said, I had to lead the News 8 crew around the airport today.
[00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:25.785]  And they sat there and talked to more than 40 people who all said they hated the new security, the pat-downs and the rest of it.
[00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:27.626]  This was five years ago when that had just started.
[00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:29.747]  Notice they're always intensifying it.
[00:09:30.187 --> 00:09:33.509]  And he said, but then they got one old lady who said she loved it.
[00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:37.391]  And he said, I've got a bet with my brother that that's all they're going to show on the news.
[00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:39.832]  Sure enough, News 8 comes on.
[00:09:40.472 --> 00:09:42.893]  They cut to the old lady, how much she loves it.
[00:09:43.814 --> 00:09:45.875]  And he won the $20 bet against his brother.
[00:09:47.483 --> 00:09:48.404]  And that's how they do it.
[00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:55.552]  I mean, they've got these newscasts of how wonderful it is to have your wife or your child have their genitals grabbed.
[00:09:55.872 --> 00:09:58.736]  How wonderful how everyone loves it to fight Al Qaeda.
[00:09:59.356 --> 00:10:01.539]  No one would put up with this anywhere in the world.
[00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:07.786]  No one would put up with 500 mobile x-ray vans the feds have driving around looking through your walls.
[00:10:08.522 --> 00:10:17.369]  No other governments, except for Israel, will use DU in warfare because it kills your own troops long-term as well as the enemy.
[00:10:20.332 --> 00:10:27.217]  But our government does it because they're completely out of control and completely lawless.
[00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:31.400]  Now, there have been a bunch of big new developments here.
[00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:35.404]  We do have John Tyner who, you know, the famous quote of
[00:10:36.561 --> 00:10:41.485]  You can pat me down all you want, but if you touch my junk, I'm gonna call the police, you're gonna get arrested.
[00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:49.933]  You know, if you or I went to a park and ran up and grabbed a woman or a man's genitals, we'd be spending probably five, ten years in prison, and we should.
[00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:54.897]  But TSA does it, and it's supposedly to keep you safe from the terrorist.
[00:10:55.478 --> 00:11:03.585]  Now, on that front, and you can pull this up at the San Diego online newspaper,
[00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:15.908]  The San Diego Herald Tribune, Union Tribune, they had a press conference yesterday and they said, how dare Mr. Tyner
[00:11:18.354 --> 00:11:20.395]  Leave the screening area unauthorized.
[00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:25.999]  We're going to charge him $11,000, and the guy says with pleasure, it was $10,000, now it's $11,000.
[00:11:26.359 --> 00:11:29.642]  Now, it just so happens he has it all recorded on audio and video.
[00:11:30.522 --> 00:11:37.087]  They told him, fine, leave, get out of here, you're not allowed to fly, which is their standard operating procedure, if you don't put up with the grope down.
[00:11:37.887 --> 00:11:45.452]  Then he's trying to leave and somebody with a suit runs out and says, you're going to be charged $10,000 for leaving a security area.
[00:11:45.732 --> 00:11:46.672]  So they set him up.
[00:11:46.733 --> 00:11:47.573]  They said, leave.
[00:11:48.233 --> 00:11:50.975]  They're like, oh, you didn't submit to us on our power trip.
[00:11:53.156 --> 00:11:53.897]  Boom, get him.
[00:11:53.937 --> 00:11:55.078]  He left the security area.
[00:11:55.338 --> 00:12:03.383]  This is part of this criminal, bullying, arrogant culture to send a message to everyone.
[00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:11.105]  But every newspaper article about this, mainstream news, is calling it police state, thuggery, recrimination.
[00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:14.367]  We'll put that headline back up for people.
[00:12:16.388 --> 00:12:19.450]  TSA to investigate body scan resistor.
[00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.071]  So, this guy just wants to go hunting.
[00:12:22.832 --> 00:12:26.794]  He wants to go pheasant hunting with his father-in-law, who's a cop, by the way.
[00:12:26.814 --> 00:12:29.195]  Doesn't matter, you're all slaves.
[00:12:31.072 --> 00:12:41.377]  They want to touch his private parts and he says no and so they say then leave and he's trying to leave and they run over and say you left the security area.
[00:12:41.657 --> 00:12:43.998]  You know the same thing happened to yours truly in 2006.
[00:12:44.118 --> 00:12:50.821]  I land in Ottawa, Canada, the capital of Canada.
[00:12:53.317 --> 00:12:57.918]  And they pull us out of line, they go, you're Alex Jones, you're here to cover the Bilderberg Group Conference, aren't you?
[00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:00.199]  And I said, yeah, I am.
[00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:04.820]  And they said, well, you're not going anywhere.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:19.665]  And they said, if we find any pornography on your laptop computers, and we had three of them, it was myself, Aaron Dykes, and Ryan Slickhaizen traveling, they said, if we find any porn on your computers, you're gonna go to prison.
[00:13:20.407 --> 00:13:22.068]  And I said, you mean illegal porn?
[00:13:22.689 --> 00:13:25.030]  And they go, no, as much as a pin-up girl.
[00:13:26.391 --> 00:13:29.053]  That is trafficking and pornography.
[00:13:29.093 --> 00:13:30.914]  You're going to federal prison here in Canada.
[00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:31.975]  They were laughing at us.
[00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:35.097]  Well, I knew my computer didn't have any porn on it.
[00:13:35.637 --> 00:13:36.678]  I crossed my fingers.
[00:13:36.878 --> 00:13:38.659]  Aaron's Slick Eyes' didn't have any.
[00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:42.042]  And I don't know what office computer probably doesn't have some on it.
[00:13:42.102 --> 00:13:44.423]  I mean, you know, that stuff pops up even when you're not looking for it.
[00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.064]  And so they spent 15 hours
[00:13:47.861 --> 00:14:11.653]  Fifteen hours, going through our computers, yelling at us, not letting us go to the bathroom, and I'm sitting there in the bucket seats in front of the office area, in between being taken into rooms and screamed at and interrogated, and there was this guy on a complete power trip, guy with a French accent,
[00:14:12.942 --> 00:14:16.044]  And they were intermittently yelling at us.
[00:14:17.105 --> 00:14:24.449]  Then they'd find news articles on PrisonPlanet.com showing Canadian police beating up protesters.
[00:14:24.469 --> 00:14:25.490]  And they would say, what's this?
[00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.590]  Were you involved in this?
[00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.031]  And I'm like, no, it's a news article.
[00:14:28.371 --> 00:14:31.153]  Like we were criminals for having news articles about Canada.
[00:14:31.373 --> 00:14:34.215]  So they were also reading PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:37.857]  And then Aaron looks over and says, what are we going to do?
[00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:39.078]  We've been here like 10 hours.
[00:14:39.872 --> 00:14:42.355]  This is like 10 hours of the 15 plus hours.
[00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:43.456]  It's about 16.
[00:14:44.157 --> 00:14:45.078]  And I said, I don't know.
[00:14:45.158 --> 00:14:47.420]  I guess they're just going to fly us back to Texas.
[00:14:48.536 --> 00:14:51.839]  And they come running around the corner going, escape, escape!
[00:14:52.219 --> 00:14:53.400]  You're trying to escape?
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.302]  We'll put you in prison for that!
[00:14:55.702 --> 00:14:58.685]  Listen to me, you bleeping scumbag American!
[00:14:59.005 --> 00:15:01.047]  The guy's got spit-flying cuss words.
[00:15:01.247 --> 00:15:03.909]  We're tired of you filthy Americans, you scum!
[00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.933]  We're tired of you coming up here and bleeping all over us, you filth!
[00:15:07.953 --> 00:15:11.255]  And he's just like, just hyperventilating with all these other crazy guards behind him.
[00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:14.919]  And he goes, you're going to go to prison in Toronto.
[00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:16.040]  You just tried to escape.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.301]  I just laughed at him.
[00:15:17.321 --> 00:15:18.702]  I said, do whatever you want, man.
[00:15:18.742 --> 00:15:19.503]  You're trash.
[00:15:19.883 --> 00:15:21.825]  I'm not putting up with you anymore, you lunatic.
[00:15:22.981 --> 00:15:43.512]  Well, little did they know they'd confiscated two of our cell phones, but Slick Heisen had a small one, and I was able to call and get Jim Tucker out of bed, who'd already flown in at his hotel, and he got the CBC and other TV there, and they showed up five hours later or so, and that guy went from being a power-tripping thug
[00:15:44.773 --> 00:15:47.495]  To groveling and saying, listen, I have a daughter.
[00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:49.536]  I could get fired over this.
[00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:52.458]  Please don't talk about this when I let you go.
[00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:53.859]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:15:54.979 --> 00:15:57.501]  But remember, you've got to go back through the airport when you leave.
[00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:05.052]  So there's also the threat, and we have the RMCP out there.
[00:16:05.072 --> 00:16:10.259]  They're going to be watching you, so you don't talk to the media about this if you want to get out of Canada.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.005]  So it's intermittent threats, but don't get me fired, my daughter.
[00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:23.233]  They did have these two beautiful RNCP people following us around that day.
[00:16:23.593 --> 00:16:25.914]  After we got out, they were driving around in a Mustang, a convertible.
[00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:26.974]  They followed us everywhere.
[00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:28.534]  They'd laugh at us and wave at us.
[00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:29.334]  They were pretty nice.
[00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:31.895]  Then they had some other male cops come after us.
[00:16:32.015 --> 00:16:34.376]  Then they had other people try to set us up.
[00:16:34.416 --> 00:16:37.716]  But the point is, it was crazy.
[00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:41.597]  And he was trying to say that I was trying to escape.
[00:16:41.637 --> 00:16:43.698]  I'm sitting there, totally exhausted.
[00:16:44.773 --> 00:16:46.314]  You know, flew in at nine at night.
[00:16:46.454 --> 00:16:48.815]  It had to be like five, six in the morning by then.
[00:16:49.295 --> 00:16:50.175]  We're like, what are we going to do?
[00:16:50.215 --> 00:16:51.816]  I'm like, I guess they're flying us back.
[00:16:52.376 --> 00:16:53.637]  I guess we're going back to Texas.
[00:16:54.477 --> 00:16:55.938]  Ah, you're trying to escape!
[00:16:56.418 --> 00:16:57.179]  I caught you!
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.440]  This is the lunacy.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.961]  This is the craziness of these people.
[00:17:03.702 --> 00:17:11.265]  And it's the exact same system in England, Canada, many areas of Europe, the United States, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:17:11.325 --> 00:17:13.326]  It's the same continuity of agenda.
[00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:15.551]  The same training.
[00:17:16.111 --> 00:17:17.612]  This is the world government system.
[00:17:18.072 --> 00:17:34.802]  Now, you think it's bad that through a Freedom of Information Act request, Gizmodo was able to get a hundred images of the naked body scans and they admittedly stored 35,000 in Florida at one federal courthouse.
[00:17:35.302 --> 00:17:36.983]  See, these are going in public schools everywhere.
[00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:38.444]  You think that's bad.
[00:17:40.085 --> 00:17:40.665]  That's nothing.
[00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:46.577]  There's a show called This Week in Tech with Leo Laporte.
[00:17:46.697 --> 00:17:48.778]  I've actually heard it, but it's on Clear Channel, isn't it?
[00:17:50.658 --> 00:17:51.299]  I know it's big.
[00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:52.679]  I know I hear it on local stations.
[00:17:52.699 --> 00:17:54.700]  I know it has millions and millions of listeners.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:01.082]  Leo Laporte, one of his fill-in hosts, who's a tech writer,
[00:18:03.388 --> 00:18:04.269]  Owen J.J.
[00:18:04.329 --> 00:18:07.113]  Stone, this is Sunday's video cast.
[00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:17.268]  We're going to play a clip of this when we come back and he's joining us coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes from now after John Tyner comes on with us.
[00:18:20.034 --> 00:18:33.641]  And I'd actually read about this, but now, it's not just enhanced pat-downs for people that don't go through scanners, it's going to be enhanced pat-downs for if you go through the scanners, and enhanced pat-downs for everyone.
[00:18:34.482 --> 00:18:40.325]  And so in the middle of this controversy, they are now introducing something new.
[00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:42.806]  And I didn't just believe Owen J.J.
[00:18:42.846 --> 00:18:49.450]  Stone, even though he's a well-respected tech writer and researcher.
[00:18:52.338 --> 00:19:01.024]  No, we did a search and found multiple newscasts that are coming out simultaneously around the country where other people are complaining.
[00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:04.506]  They now stick their hands down your pants.
[00:19:05.166 --> 00:19:07.128]  They don't just run around the edge of your waistband.
[00:19:07.748 --> 00:19:10.609]  They now stick their hands down your pants.
[00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:13.409]  So they're now actually touching your skin.
[00:19:13.869 --> 00:19:16.770]  It's not enough to grab your genitals through the pants and lift up.
[00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:17.970]  Let me make sure that isn't a bomb.
[00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.570]  Go ahead and give it a squeeze.
[00:19:20.111 --> 00:19:21.631]  Or grab your wife's breast and do it.
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:26.532]  Now they're announcing that, well they're actually doing it.
[00:19:27.212 --> 00:19:31.773]  That they're putting their hands down your pants.
[00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:34.194]  Physically touching your skin.
[00:19:34.514 --> 00:19:35.794]  I mean they've got a blue glove on.
[00:19:36.533 --> 00:19:38.714]  By the way, they're not changing those blue gloves every time.
[00:19:39.314 --> 00:19:43.636]  That's another issue, the unsanitariness.
[00:19:44.496 --> 00:19:49.779]  It's horrible, very unsanitary, to make everybody take their shoes off and walk through the same area.
[00:19:50.419 --> 00:19:53.060]  With all that athlete's foot and the rest of it, it's disgusting.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.021]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:55.701 --> 00:19:56.502]  Pure water.
[00:19:56.802 --> 00:19:59.263]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[00:19:59.503 --> 00:20:03.505]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday season than BigBerkyWaterFilters.com.
[00:20:07.558 --> 00:20:12.619]  Well water, chances are that water is contaminated with rust, bacteria, chlorine, and fluoride.
[00:20:12.819 --> 00:20:23.061]  For just pennies a day, Berkey water filters remove dangerous contaminants from both well and city water, is powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, and is great for camping and emergencies.
[00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:28.902]  Right now, GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems and free shipping on orders over $50.
[00:20:30.003 --> 00:20:37.144]  Purchase any filter system from BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com to get your choice of Berkey Sport bottles, a KDF shower filter, a set of
[00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:37.744]  I think so.
[00:20:54.577 --> 00:21:00.779]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:09.023]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:09.363 --> 00:21:17.206]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:22.291]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:22.612 --> 00:21:27.337]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:27.837 --> 00:21:31.702]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:32.202 --> 00:21:33.203]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:33.283 --> 00:21:37.308]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:37.768 --> 00:21:42.154]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:42.675 --> 00:21:45.238]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:21:47.461 --> 00:21:47.681]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.868 --> 00:21:57.230]  We're subject to other police action.
[00:21:58.032 --> 00:21:58.973]  Tyranny is here.
[00:21:59.314 --> 00:22:03.039]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:05.463]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:05.483 --> 00:22:10.651]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:22:11.332 --> 00:22:17.614]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:18.014 --> 00:22:23.556]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:23.997 --> 00:22:27.638]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:22:28.158 --> 00:22:32.139]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:32.439 --> 00:22:37.940]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.361]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:41.941 --> 00:22:43.341]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:43.921 --> 00:22:44.401]  It's here.

[00:24:03.214 --> 00:24:12.158]  Out in the control room during the break, Matt, our IT guy, was making the point of, couldn't this spread venereal diseases like crabs?
[00:24:13.158 --> 00:24:19.461]  I mean, now the TSA sticks their hand down your pants, inside your pants, to make sure it's not a bomb.
[00:24:19.481 --> 00:24:21.682]  And I have multiple newscasts.
[00:24:22.447 --> 00:24:24.568]  Not just this talk show host Owen J.J.
[00:24:24.588 --> 00:24:27.909]  Stone on This Week in Tech talking about it.
[00:24:28.369 --> 00:24:29.910]  We have multiple newscasts.
[00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:36.092]  It's about to go up on YouTube, a boil down of some of these newscasts and this eyewitness report.
[00:24:36.572 --> 00:24:48.476]  Imagine if you or I didn't just run up and grab some lady at a park by her genitals or breast, but imagine if you grab the TSA by their genitals when they're touching your genitals.
[00:24:49.434 --> 00:24:51.355]  You're going to go to prison for sexual assault.
[00:24:52.236 --> 00:24:55.919]  And none of this has to do with keeping you safe from bombs or terrorists.
[00:24:56.419 --> 00:24:59.382]  It is about indoctrinating us to accept this tyranny.
[00:24:59.722 --> 00:25:03.885]  Now, I want to go ahead and go to this clip from this week in tech.
[00:25:03.925 --> 00:25:06.467]  This was just this Sunday with Owen J.J.
[00:25:06.527 --> 00:25:06.927]  Stone.
[00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:12.151]  He's coming up later in the next hour to break it down in more detail for us.
[00:25:12.612 --> 00:25:15.414]  But here he recounts what happened to him.
[00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:20.244]  ...the x-ray machines, and in fact, I don't know, they had recently, or is it coming up?
[00:25:21.024 --> 00:25:24.347]  Wednesday, November 24th, 2010 is National Opt-Out Day.
[00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:27.870]  Now, most people don't know, on the x-ray machines, you can always opt out.
[00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.692]  All you have to say is, I opt out, and then they give you a pat-down search.
[00:25:31.373 --> 00:25:34.495]  And if we all did it... I do that all the time, regardless.
[00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:35.456]  Well, listen, maybe.
[00:25:35.476 --> 00:25:35.796]  I don't know.
[00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:39.239]  When I just flew here this weekend, I wore the same sweatpants I wore last week to go to L.A.
[00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:43.002]  This weekend when I came in, he's like, oh they just changed the rules this week.
[00:25:43.382 --> 00:25:45.524]  Do you want a private screening or do you want us to pat you down out here?
[00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.184]  And I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:25:46.224 --> 00:25:49.847]  He's like, well do you want us to take you in the back room or do you want us to do it out here?
[00:25:49.907 --> 00:25:50.528]  What does it entail?
[00:25:50.748 --> 00:25:52.930]  I have to go in your waistband, put my hand down your pants.
[00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.031]  I'm like, do it out here.
[00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:56.593]  And I stood in front of everybody and he did it.
[00:25:56.613 --> 00:25:57.653]  Wait a minute, what's the alternative?
[00:25:57.673 --> 00:25:58.574]  Can I go through a machine?
[00:25:59.135 --> 00:26:01.116]  No, the alternative is for him to go in the back room and pat.
[00:26:01.456 --> 00:26:03.438]  He's going to put his hands down your pants no matter what?
[00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:04.039]  He did, yes.
[00:26:04.699 --> 00:26:07.562]  And I said, I'd rather have him do it out here in public, because of just what Brian said.
[00:26:07.902 --> 00:26:10.604]  He's already ashamed to do it, and I feel like he's not going to go as deep.
[00:26:10.644 --> 00:26:11.385]  When did this happen?
[00:26:11.465 --> 00:26:12.086]  This weekend!
[00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:14.508]  They're required to put their hands down your pants?
[00:26:14.528 --> 00:26:15.349]  They just changed the rule.
[00:26:15.369 --> 00:26:17.250]  He put his hands on... Wait a minute!
[00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:18.432]  You're blowing my mind here!
[00:26:22.295 --> 00:26:28.461]  This is the new TSA, is that you have to get... If you're wearing sweatpants or baggy clothing... Oh, baggy clothing.
[00:26:28.601 --> 00:26:29.302]  I was wearing sweatpants.
[00:26:29.322 --> 00:26:30.603]  They're not baggy, they're sweatpants.
[00:26:30.963 --> 00:26:32.444]  He put his hand... This is my waistband.
[00:26:32.525 --> 00:26:35.607]  Because I gotta tell you, if I have to get somebody to hand down my pants, I'm not lying.
[00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:40.492]  He ran his hand around the ring of my waistband, and then patted the front, and then patted my butt, and then in my crotch.
[00:26:40.572 --> 00:26:41.833]  And you know, it's all security theater.
[00:26:41.853 --> 00:26:43.153]  It does absolutely nothing.
[00:26:43.273 --> 00:26:44.234]  That's the part that kills me.
[00:26:44.374 --> 00:26:54.400]  Is that, is that for all of the federalization, for all this giant bureaucracy, for the five dollars that you have to pay for every single flight, going and coming back everywhere you go, we get not one percentage point bump.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:55.900]  Insecurity.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:56.961]  And the guy was embarrassed to do it.
[00:26:56.981 --> 00:26:58.162]  He says sorry like five times.
[00:26:58.182 --> 00:26:59.803]  He's like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:26:59.823 --> 00:27:01.704]  Imagine, excuse me, but would you like that job?
[00:27:01.904 --> 00:27:02.104]  No.
[00:27:02.304 --> 00:27:03.044]  Horrible job.
[00:27:03.224 --> 00:27:03.505]  Alright.
[00:27:03.525 --> 00:27:04.125]  Oh, you know what's funny?
[00:27:04.285 --> 00:27:05.566]  Is anyone who follows my Twitter feed...
[00:27:06.445 --> 00:27:09.988]  Alright, we're going to have him on the show coming up in about an hour.
[00:27:10.008 --> 00:27:12.070]  That's Owen J.J.
[00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:12.450]  Stone.
[00:27:14.197 --> 00:27:21.180]  And we're going to get an article out at PrisonPlanet.com in the next 30 minutes on this subject.
[00:27:22.001 --> 00:27:26.723]  The TSA, ladies and gentlemen, now sticks their hands inside your pants.
[00:27:27.163 --> 00:27:29.704]  Now, notice they've just announced this in the last two weeks.
[00:27:30.345 --> 00:27:34.447]  We found multiple newscasts separately from this due to the backlash.
[00:27:34.467 --> 00:27:37.088]  They're like, oh, you don't like naked body scanners?
[00:27:37.108 --> 00:27:39.289]  You don't like us touching your genitals on the outside?
[00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:41.050]  We'll do it on the inside.
[00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.711]  Oh, you don't like that?
[00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:44.453]  We'll do a cavity search.
[00:27:44.593 --> 00:27:45.454]  Oh, you don't like that?
[00:27:45.974 --> 00:27:47.216]  We'll cut your head off.
[00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:49.158]  You know, it's just on and on and on.
[00:27:49.498 --> 00:27:50.979]  Pushing, pushing, pushing.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.821]  Oh, get out of here!
[00:27:54.022 --> 00:27:56.865]  They told John Tyner, get out of here, you don't get to fly then.
[00:27:57.386 --> 00:27:58.187]  He's like, okay.
[00:27:58.747 --> 00:28:00.108]  He goes and gets his ticket refunded.
[00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.949]  This is on record.
[00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.191]  It's all recorded.
[00:28:02.811 --> 00:28:04.353]  It's in the San Diego newspapers.
[00:28:05.643 --> 00:28:14.366]  He goes and gets a ticket refund, he's about to leave, and a goon runs up in a suit and says, you're not allowed to leave, you tried to escape the screening area.
[00:28:14.666 --> 00:28:16.306]  That's a $10,000 fine!
[00:28:16.326 --> 00:28:19.728]  And he's like, on the tape, he's, but you told me to go.
[00:28:19.748 --> 00:28:22.588]  They're like, it doesn't matter, we're gonna get you now.
[00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:23.889]  They set him up.
[00:28:26.087 --> 00:28:29.450]  There it is, TSA to investigate body scan resistor.
[00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.411]  You don't like us trying to grab your crotch?
[00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:33.573]  You don't like us sticking our hand down your pants?
[00:28:34.233 --> 00:28:35.614]  You don't like the government doing this?
[00:28:35.654 --> 00:28:36.275]  You don't like it?
[00:28:36.675 --> 00:28:46.563]  And now they have a press conference last night where the head of the TSA in San Diego, he's there on the screen in the lower photo, he comes out
[00:28:48.174 --> 00:28:50.496]  And says, oh, I'm afraid it's not 10,000.
[00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:52.017]  You can watch the video.
[00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:52.677]  It's 11,000.
[00:28:54.118 --> 00:28:54.799]  He relishes it.
[00:28:54.819 --> 00:28:58.361]  And he goes, Mr. Tyner's in a lot of trouble.
[00:28:58.802 --> 00:29:00.363]  We're going to get you, Mr. Tyner.
[00:29:01.383 --> 00:29:03.605]  Imagine, they're caught framing Tyner.
[00:29:04.065 --> 00:29:05.286]  They tell him, leave.
[00:29:05.987 --> 00:29:06.327]  Go.
[00:29:06.467 --> 00:29:07.648]  Go get your ticket refunded.
[00:29:07.988 --> 00:29:09.049]  He goes, gets it refunded.
[00:29:09.089 --> 00:29:09.749]  He's walking out.
[00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.432]  And a guy runs up and says, we got you now.
[00:29:13.512 --> 00:29:14.613]  You left the screening area.
[00:29:17.515 --> 00:29:17.695]  I mean,
[00:29:19.184 --> 00:29:21.806]  That's why the TSA lies and says they don't save the images.
[00:29:22.306 --> 00:29:28.229]  That's why they lie just last week and said they don't touch your genitals when they put out the press release saying that they were doing it.
[00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.211]  It's just a culture of disdaining us.
[00:29:31.632 --> 00:29:37.175]  But America and the planet is waking up and getting angry and saying no, no, no.
[00:29:37.535 --> 00:29:40.517]  This is the beginning of the end of the New World Order.
[00:29:40.557 --> 00:29:41.017]  You watch.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.380]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.861 --> 00:29:48.362]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.381 --> 00:29:52.162]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.184 --> 00:29:56.805]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:29:56.845 --> 00:29:59.646]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:30:00.206 --> 00:30:05.129]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[00:30:15.375 --> 00:30:16.316]  Take my word for it.
[00:30:16.516 --> 00:30:18.838]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:30:19.159 --> 00:30:25.384]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:30:25.684 --> 00:30:28.487]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support InfoWars.

[00:30:43.431 --> 00:30:47.195]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[00:30:47.235 --> 00:30:47.736]  Thank you!
[00:30:54.721 --> 00:30:58.944]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:59.265 --> 00:30:59.545]  Number 1.
[00:31:00.185 --> 00:31:03.328]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:03.608 --> 00:31:04.168]  Number 2.
[00:31:04.469 --> 00:31:09.012]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:09.352 --> 00:31:09.813]  It's true.
[00:31:10.113 --> 00:31:14.656]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:14.977 --> 00:31:15.517]  Number 3.
[00:31:15.797 --> 00:31:19.080]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.083]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:23.283 --> 00:31:23.844]  Number 4.
[00:31:24.084 --> 00:31:26.446]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:26.846 --> 00:31:30.229]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:31.070]  Number 5.
[00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:35.233]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:35.454 --> 00:31:40.218]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:44.539]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.240]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.521]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:48.721 --> 00:31:51.062]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:54.784 --> 00:31:58.088]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:58.368 --> 00:31:59.449]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:59.669 --> 00:32:03.854]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:04.074 --> 00:32:09.720]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:12.003]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.846]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:15.186 --> 00:32:21.489]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:23.490]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.952]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:29.232 --> 00:32:34.214]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:32:34.514 --> 00:32:39.697]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:32:39.877 --> 00:32:42.818]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:32:43.078 --> 00:32:45.939]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:45.959 --> 00:32:46.840]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:32:55.325 --> 00:32:56.045]  We've got it.
[00:32:56.065 --> 00:33:02.328]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:02.429 --> 00:33:06.510]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:06.791 --> 00:33:12.473]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:15.235 --> 00:33:23.259]  There have been many triggers throughout history to corrupt regimes being overthrown.
[00:33:25.346 --> 00:33:46.476]  And fiction follows reality in the movie V for Vendetta where the little girl is wearing the Guy Fawkes mask and she runs away from the police and they shoot her in the back and then the public starts rioting and taking over the government.
[00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:50.658]  You know, that's basically what happened with Ceaușescu in Romania.
[00:33:52.711 --> 00:34:00.274]  They had this illusion that everybody liked the tyranny, everybody liked the surveillance cameras, everybody liked the checkpoints, everybody liked the corruption.
[00:34:00.614 --> 00:34:07.857]  But when people finally started standing up, it was like wildfire, the system imploded.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.422]  Now the social engineers know this.
[00:34:12.122 --> 00:34:13.043]  They understand that.
[00:34:13.143 --> 00:34:26.473]  So they try to go provocateur violent groups to attack federal buildings or attack synagogues or attack children to then demonize any type of movement against tyranny.
[00:34:28.875 --> 00:34:35.240]  So that when people organically stand up against oppression, they could have already preemptively been painted as terrorist.
[00:34:36.576 --> 00:34:45.203]  It basically may be like saying if somebody ran away from the plantation 200 years ago from Alabama, that they were a terrorist.
[00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:50.487]  Did they as a human being have a right to run away from slavery?
[00:34:51.068 --> 00:34:55.331]  Now, I don't want to have violent confrontations with the government.
[00:34:55.811 --> 00:34:57.753]  The government is made up of we the people.
[00:34:58.874 --> 00:35:01.156]  And our country has been taken over by foreign
[00:35:03.319 --> 00:35:04.660]  Foreign corrupt interest.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.801]  And so I believe in info war.
[00:35:07.702 --> 00:35:25.775]  And we are seeing a massive info war take place right now by the people all over the world where they have these invasive checkpoints that have been put in place, but focused here in the U.S.
[00:35:26.175 --> 00:35:26.976]  saying no.
[00:35:27.956 --> 00:35:30.138]  The pilots saying you let me fly the airplane?
[00:35:33.663 --> 00:35:44.988]  You let me control the aircraft, but I have to go through all these checkpoints?
[00:35:47.509 --> 00:35:54.892]  The general public's saying, why don't you just profile people that you think are supposedly terrorists?
[00:35:55.953 --> 00:36:02.496]  No, people see through this in a big, big way.
[00:36:05.438 --> 00:36:16.346]  People understand this is a basic fraud and they're beginning to learn that the TSA has already expanded with Viper teams to checkpoints on highways, bus stations, train stations.
[00:36:16.666 --> 00:36:20.349]  Now they want them in malls, in community areas.
[00:36:21.009 --> 00:36:22.911]  This is a federal power grab.
[00:36:24.417 --> 00:36:26.398]  And the population is saying no.
[00:36:27.158 --> 00:36:34.421]  And the polls in Reuters, 96 percent, it was 97, it's still running, 96 percent say they won't fly because of this.
[00:36:35.042 --> 00:36:41.565]  Every other poll, it's 60, 70, 80 percent, CBS News polls, you name it, of people saying they're against this.
[00:36:42.165 --> 00:36:45.306]  And the government says, we don't care, we're doing it because we want to protect you.
[00:36:45.666 --> 00:36:49.388]  This is a government for, of, and by the people.
[00:36:49.728 --> 00:36:51.389]  If we don't want it, that's the way it is.
[00:36:52.469 --> 00:36:58.772]  You've got a better chance of being struck by lightning than being killed by a terrorist.
[00:36:59.992 --> 00:37:02.733]  I mean, are they going to put checkpoints in every street corner to stop muggings?
[00:37:04.234 --> 00:37:05.734]  This is about a federal power grab.
[00:37:05.774 --> 00:37:11.537]  Now, we have on the line John Tyner, who's now being persecuted.
[00:37:11.897 --> 00:37:16.499]  In fact, here's the headline, TSA to investigate body scan resistor.
[00:37:17.019 --> 00:37:19.340]  But I've watched all the video that he recorded.
[00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:41.034]  on his uh... smartphone and they told him to leave he went and got his ticket refunded and then somebody runs up in a suit and says we're gonna get you civilly for ten thousand now they have a press conference the head of the TSA in San Diego last night and says it's eleven thousand and we're going after him this is a guy they told to leave
[00:37:41.815 --> 00:37:44.498]  He leaves and then they come set him up.
[00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:48.684]  This is bullying tyrants only exposing their true nature.
[00:37:49.064 --> 00:37:50.326]  John, good to have you on with us.
[00:37:50.546 --> 00:37:51.247]  Well, thanks for having me.
[00:37:51.267 --> 00:37:51.727]  How are you doing?
[00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:56.373]  Well, I'm doing great because we're seeing a huge awakening take place.
[00:37:56.393 --> 00:37:58.836]  Out of the gates, what do you think of this
[00:38:00.026 --> 00:38:02.548]  Huge revolt taking place.
[00:38:02.588 --> 00:38:06.151]  This is the biggest story in the country, this issue with the TSA.
[00:38:06.752 --> 00:38:08.113]  It's certainly not what I expected.
[00:38:08.133 --> 00:38:12.317]  It's certainly not what I intended when I had an encounter with them, but I think it's great personally.
[00:38:13.988 --> 00:38:24.251]  Let's talk about your case specifically because the audio's good, but obviously the camera's laying there, you know, on the little gray boxes where they're searching you.
[00:38:25.611 --> 00:38:27.591]  Now they're coming after you.
[00:38:28.212 --> 00:38:31.932]  It's clear from the tape that they told you go ahead and go.
[00:38:32.433 --> 00:38:37.934]  Then how can they come back then and say that you basically escaped from the checkpoint area?
[00:38:38.294 --> 00:38:39.575]  That's an excellent question.
[00:38:39.615 --> 00:38:47.038]  I was told by two TSA supervisors and Harbor Police that I could either be patted down or be escorted out of the area.
[00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:55.582]  And you can see them all allowing me to leave and having an officer escort me out of the area once they determined that it was time for me to go.
[00:38:57.884 --> 00:38:58.965]  And then what happened next?
[00:38:59.345 --> 00:39:04.007]  Well, I went over to the American Airlines counter and asked them to refund my ticket, and they happily did it.
[00:39:04.227 --> 00:39:07.369]  You know, despite it being a non-refundable ticket, they happily refunded it.
[00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:21.617]  After about five minutes over there, I began to try and leave the airport when I was approached by another TSA representative who I hadn't seen before, and he was accompanied by the supervisor who had directed the agents to escort me out, and also the Harvard police officer who had escorted me out.
[00:39:22.357 --> 00:39:31.245]  And this new gentleman told me that I needed to return to the screening area and finish being screened because it's against federal law to begin the screening process but to not finish it.
[00:39:33.766 --> 00:39:39.769]  Well, that's amazing because the standard procedure is if you refuse the screening, they tell you to leave the airport.
[00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:46.572]  That's what happened with the lady in Florida that got so much attention, Meg McLean.
[00:39:47.913 --> 00:39:52.695]  They could get in trouble here for false charges or false civil claims.
[00:39:53.535 --> 00:39:57.758]  I know that there are civil and criminal penalties for that in the U.S.
[00:39:57.838 --> 00:39:58.218]  Code.
[00:39:58.738 --> 00:40:00.259]  I mean, the TSA has
[00:40:00.919 --> 00:40:02.100]  I honestly couldn't tell you.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.382]  I don't know what end they're trying to achieve by trying to intimidate me with a fine.
[00:40:24.602 --> 00:40:29.165]  Well, John, do you agree with my statement that this appears to be a frame up?
[00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:31.547]  I mean, they know that they told you to leave the airport.
[00:40:32.008 --> 00:40:35.951]  They know that they said that, you know, either put up with this or leave.
[00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:37.532]  And so they escorted you out.
[00:40:37.592 --> 00:40:38.553]  You went to get your ticket.
[00:40:38.573 --> 00:40:41.695]  You weren't running through the concourse like you were escaping.
[00:40:42.616 --> 00:40:51.162]  And then now they're claiming that you violated some type of civil act and they want $11,000 and they're demonizing your name publicly.
[00:40:51.503 --> 00:40:53.144]  I mean, is this not a witch hunt?
[00:40:53.944 --> 00:40:56.746]  I'm not sure that I would characterize it as a frame-up or a witch-hunt.
[00:40:56.786 --> 00:41:02.429]  I think probably what happened is they violated their own policies and now they've got to try and make me responsible for it.
[00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:11.533]  Violated their own policies, so... Now, you notice this isn't law.
[00:41:11.553 --> 00:41:13.534]  That's why they're threatening you with something civil.
[00:41:14.595 --> 00:41:15.695]  Yeah, I'm not a lawyer.
[00:41:15.735 --> 00:41:20.898]  I'm not familiar with all the ins and outs of what's civil and what's criminal and exactly what law it is that I broke.
[00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:25.742]  So, but they're claiming it's the law, they have to fondle your genitals?
[00:41:26.722 --> 00:41:34.528]  That's essentially, it sounds like the argument, because essentially if you follow their logic, when they ask me to leave, what I should have done, you know, was refuse and stay.
[00:41:35.669 --> 00:41:38.470]  And say, you know what, hey, I need to be fondled before I can leave here.
[00:41:42.693 --> 00:41:48.758]  But to be clear, because I've watched the tape many times, they say either do this or we're going to escort you out.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:50.760]  Yes.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.401]  And that's always been the procedure.
[00:41:52.501 --> 00:42:01.826]  I guess they're now saying that they're going to charge people civilly with an $11,000 fine if you don't put up with whatever searches they deem necessary.
[00:42:02.087 --> 00:42:06.429]  And if that means chest x-rays, if that means cavity searches, then so be it.
[00:42:07.049 --> 00:42:08.030]  It does appear that way.
[00:42:08.885 --> 00:42:09.765]  Well, where does this end?
[00:42:09.805 --> 00:42:18.730]  I mean, if Al-Qaeda puts a hand grenade up their rear end, I mean, are we all going to have to watch our 3- and 4-year-olds have TSA workers do proctology exams?
[00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.392]  I don't think that that's an unfair assessment based on the characterization.
[00:42:22.472 --> 00:42:25.474]  I mean, Richard Reid tried to blow up his shoes, so now we all take our shoes off.
[00:42:25.494 --> 00:42:29.376]  This guy last Christmas tried to stuff a bomb down his pants, now we all submit to strip searches.
[00:42:29.396 --> 00:42:34.098]  So I assume as soon as somebody tries to cram something into some orifice, we're all going to get cavity searches.
[00:42:36.089 --> 00:42:38.971]  Well, I've been here asking a lot of the questions, John Tyner.
[00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:51.602]  For those who just joined us, he's the gentleman who recorded what the TSA basically put him through, and to add insult to injury, now they're investigating whether they're going to charge you civilly for $11,000.
[00:42:52.763 --> 00:42:55.745]  Are you planning on fighting that if they try to bring you into civil court?
[00:42:56.366 --> 00:42:58.928]  Yes, if they try and do that, then yeah, I will fight it.
[00:42:59.188 --> 00:43:03.912]  I've been contacted by the Rutherford Institute and the ACLU and a number of local attorneys who are all
[00:43:04.975 --> 00:43:06.515]  I don't intend to sue them first.
[00:43:06.535 --> 00:43:08.536]  I think that getting my story out is
[00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:25.272]  I don't think so.
[00:43:36.764 --> 00:43:37.724]  Carry this any further.
[00:43:37.744 --> 00:43:43.587]  I think the fact that the news is getting out and that people are seeing that they can stand up to this is good enough for me.
[00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:45.908]  Sure, but you're saying you will defend yourself.
[00:43:45.948 --> 00:43:47.648]  You're not just planning on paying the $11,000.
[00:43:47.949 --> 00:43:48.889]  That's true.
[00:43:48.909 --> 00:43:55.772]  I think it's absolutely ridiculous that they can direct me out of the airport and then fine me $11,000 for following what they asked me to do.
[00:43:57.252 --> 00:43:57.933]  Unbelievable.
[00:43:58.433 --> 00:44:00.033]  John, I've been asking a lot of questions.
[00:44:00.093 --> 00:44:02.314]  What else do you think is important for the listeners to hear?
[00:44:02.334 --> 00:44:03.895]  Oh boy.
[00:44:06.954 --> 00:44:09.075]  Kind of an open-ended question I wasn't really prepared for.
[00:44:09.435 --> 00:44:15.118]  Well, I mean, we've covered a lot of facets of this, and the country is in revolt.
[00:44:15.158 --> 00:44:20.661]  This is one of those sagebrush-type rebellions that's really caught the public's imagination.
[00:44:20.801 --> 00:44:28.164]  Everybody has been humiliated by this, or had families been humiliated, or witnessed small children having their groin grabbed.
[00:44:28.604 --> 00:44:29.745]  It's very upsetting.
[00:44:31.166 --> 00:44:40.691]  And so this story is probably the biggest story going on right now worldwide, just the overall intrusion of this federal bureaucracy.
[00:44:41.591 --> 00:44:43.212]  Yeah, I absolutely agree with that.
[00:44:43.252 --> 00:44:48.475]  You know, I wish more people had the opportunity to stand up, you know, for what they think is right.
[00:44:49.036 --> 00:44:58.221]  But, you know, when you get to the airport and, you know, you've got, you know, hundreds if not thousands of dollars invested in a trip, a lot of people just think, hey, you know, I'll put up with this because I can't afford not to.
[00:45:00.362 --> 00:45:01.943]  Why didn't they just drop this?
[00:45:02.003 --> 00:45:03.304]  That would have been the smart thing.
[00:45:03.344 --> 00:45:04.465]  You put the video out.
[00:45:04.545 --> 00:45:05.465]  You exposed them.
[00:45:05.905 --> 00:45:12.950]  It only makes them look that much more bullying and thuggish to come back and have press conferences about you.
[00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:18.233]  And I thought this was about terrorists, not about somebody trying to go pheasant hunting.
[00:45:18.673 --> 00:45:20.134]  Yeah, that's an excellent question.
[00:45:20.154 --> 00:45:25.738]  I mean, the only thing I can think is, you know, the video makes them look bad and they had to get out and, you know, answer it.
[00:45:27.006 --> 00:45:31.890]  I couldn't really tell you why they decided to come out and do anything or, you know, pursue the issue.
[00:45:32.151 --> 00:45:38.857]  But they couldn't argue with what they said and did on the tape, so they then imply that you did something illegal or unlawful?
[00:45:39.157 --> 00:45:43.662]  I think they don't want to be the bad guy in this incident, and the only person left to make the bad guy is me.
[00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:47.116]  The only person left to be the bad guy is you.
[00:45:47.856 --> 00:45:49.076]  Absolutely disgusting.
[00:45:49.236 --> 00:45:51.517]  What did the ACLU say to you about your case?
[00:45:51.857 --> 00:45:58.039]  They just sent me an email and said, you know, here's our contact information if you need to contact us, we're here.
[00:45:59.819 --> 00:46:02.020]  John, are you going to be flying anytime soon?
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.101]  I have no plans to fly until these machines and or the pad down, you know, until both go away.
[00:46:08.709 --> 00:46:15.735]  I've seen statistics from CNN of over 9 billion a year lost in just the last few years with the invasive searches.
[00:46:15.775 --> 00:46:27.124]  And as this intensifies, again we saw the Reuters poll, 96% now out of over 70,000 respondents, 96% say they're not going to be flying.
[00:46:28.565 --> 00:46:30.827]  I mean, this is devastating our economy, John.
[00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:32.168]  I agree.
[00:46:32.348 --> 00:46:34.530]  And it's not really making us safer either.
[00:46:39.272 --> 00:46:44.797]  Have you heard a time frame on whether or not they're going to try to fine you $11,000?
[00:46:45.537 --> 00:46:48.200]  No, I don't know anything more than what you read in the news.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.161]  I haven't been contacted by anyone from TSA.
[00:46:50.201 --> 00:46:55.946]  Well, I tell you, I really, I think it's bad PR what they're doing.
[00:46:56.506 --> 00:46:57.407]  What's your view on that?
[00:46:57.788 --> 00:46:59.409]  I think that's, I think that's correct.
[00:46:59.509 --> 00:47:01.791]  Yeah, I don't see any upside for them.
[00:47:06.598 --> 00:47:07.839]  Where do you see this ending?
[00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:12.182]  I mean, none of us have a crystal ball, but clearly the American people are finding their spine.
[00:47:12.562 --> 00:47:14.063]  They're getting up on their hind legs.
[00:47:14.663 --> 00:47:16.024]  They're saying, no, no, no.
[00:47:17.165 --> 00:47:19.286]  But Big Brother doesn't like to back off.
[00:47:20.006 --> 00:47:25.790]  And I don't know if you're aware of this, but we've got him coming on, coming up in the next hour.
[00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:30.813]  One of the hosts, fill-in host with Tech Talk, Owen J.J.
[00:47:30.853 --> 00:47:31.374]  Stone, has
[00:47:33.857 --> 00:47:45.141]  Talked on the syndicated program about, and then we went and searched the term and actually found other newscasts confirming this, that the TSA is now putting their hands down people's pants.
[00:47:45.961 --> 00:47:46.762]  Were you aware of that?
[00:47:47.302 --> 00:47:55.405]  No, I mean, I've heard stories of them at least putting their fingers inside of waistbands, but no, I have not heard any stories about them actually putting their hands into people's pants.
[00:47:55.485 --> 00:47:58.706]  Yes, now they're not just doing it in the waistband, they're going deeper.
[00:47:59.506 --> 00:48:00.727]  Yeah, I was unaware of that.
[00:48:02.423 --> 00:48:03.884]  So where do you see all this ending?
[00:48:05.326 --> 00:48:06.166]  I'm not really sure.
[00:48:06.226 --> 00:48:09.509]  I mean, in general, people tend to have short attention spans.
[00:48:09.569 --> 00:48:15.315]  I mean, I had an interview cancel on me this morning because Prince William announced his engagement.
[00:48:15.335 --> 00:48:16.656]  So, I don't know.
[00:48:16.696 --> 00:48:25.764]  I mean, I certainly hope it ends up with, you know, possibly even the TSA being abolished, but that seems unlikely given, you know, people's attention spans seem to be pretty short.
[00:48:27.913 --> 00:48:30.896]  I tend to agree with you on most issues.
[00:48:31.597 --> 00:48:46.673]  People don't have a long attention span but having minimum wage type folks waddling around in their little uniforms, groping children, putting us through radiation scanners, that has a way of
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.522]  Of making people continue their anger.
[00:48:50.562 --> 00:48:53.144]  In fact, I see it only intensifying.
[00:48:53.204 --> 00:48:56.646]  This disgust with the TSA was already there.
[00:48:56.686 --> 00:48:58.248]  It was always there.
[00:48:58.308 --> 00:49:02.311]  But as more people speak up like yourself, it's now creating a focal point.
[00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:04.452]  Yeah, no, that's absolutely true.
[00:49:04.492 --> 00:49:09.976]  And like I said, I certainly hope that it grows and becomes a bigger thing and people actually stand up for their rights.
[00:49:10.737 --> 00:49:15.841]  But I would be lying if I said that I think that that's the most likely outcome of this.
[00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:29.842]  John, are you aware that TSA has announced they have already deployed Viper teams on the streets of major cities and that they want to start the naked body scanners with mobile trucks?
[00:49:30.142 --> 00:49:42.126]  They've even ordered the trucks and that they plan to take this type of invasive activity to the streets of America and then England already has mobile trucks where they pull up outside bars and make patrons go through them?
[00:49:42.906 --> 00:49:44.607]  I am not aware of either of those things, no.
[00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:46.897]  What's your view on that?
[00:49:47.637 --> 00:49:48.858]  That seems pretty scary to me.
[00:49:50.839 --> 00:49:52.380]  Sounds like Big Brother, doesn't it?
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.502]  Yeah, exactly like Big Brother.
[00:49:56.763 --> 00:50:01.726]  Well, John, we've got to go to break here, but I want to hold you over for another five minutes.
[00:50:01.746 --> 00:50:03.167]  You'll be gone by the end of the hour.
[00:50:03.528 --> 00:50:10.792]  I want to come back and go over the USA Today article that Big Sis,
[00:50:12.486 --> 00:50:25.372]  Janet Napolitano wrote because in that she lays out a bunch of things that are quite frankly lies and I wanted to mention some of those to you briefly and get your take on it.
[00:50:25.392 --> 00:50:34.457]  I also want to tell folks about your blog when we return if folks want to be able to see the videos and also read in detail your own account.
[00:50:35.177 --> 00:50:37.620]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're joined by John Tyner.
[00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:39.022]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:39.282 --> 00:50:42.807]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:43.227 --> 00:50:49.835]  And yes, the TSA has announced now they're not just going to run their fingers through your waistband, they're going to stick their hands fully down in your pants.
[00:50:50.195 --> 00:50:51.036]  This is now happening.
[00:50:51.077 --> 00:50:51.477]  Stay with us.

[00:51:55.216 --> 00:52:00.080]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:00.961]  What have we got?
[00:52:01.181 --> 00:52:03.303]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:03.643 --> 00:52:04.384]  A republic.
[00:52:04.644 --> 00:52:07.226]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:07.286 --> 00:52:09.208]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:09.548 --> 00:52:11.450]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:12.851]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:13.271 --> 00:52:14.372]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:14.573 --> 00:52:14.973]  Children?
[00:52:15.193 --> 00:52:15.974]  Our education?
[00:52:16.314 --> 00:52:16.955]  Our money?
[00:52:17.135 --> 00:52:20.798]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:25.783]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:26.103 --> 00:52:26.944]  We have the facts.
[00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:28.265]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:28.305 --> 00:52:29.186]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:29.206 --> 00:52:30.047]  We have common law.
[00:52:30.107 --> 00:52:32.349]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:32.609 --> 00:52:36.393]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:36.513 --> 00:52:41.298]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:42.840]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.801]  Don't tread on me.

[00:52:54.813 --> 00:53:03.897]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:53:04.037 --> 00:53:07.378]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[00:53:07.599 --> 00:53:17.023]  Introducing Off The Grid News, the weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:53:17.183 --> 00:53:22.425]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[00:53:22.725 --> 00:53:24.886]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent.
[00:53:25.206 --> 00:53:36.028]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[00:53:36.208 --> 00:53:37.969]  With absolutely no apologies.
[00:53:38.169 --> 00:53:42.650]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:43.250]  That's right.
[00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:44.190]  John Tyner is our guest.
[00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:45.871]  We were talking during the break.
[00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:11.600]  John, in your own words, repeat what you were saying to me during the break.
[00:54:12.501 --> 00:54:13.161]  Uh, which part?
[00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:17.103]  Well, you were, you know, saying if we put up with this, we'll put up with anything.
[00:54:17.523 --> 00:54:19.684]  Oh, well, yeah, you had said that, yeah, but yeah, I agree.
[00:54:19.824 --> 00:54:21.385]  I mean, there's not much else.
[00:54:21.745 --> 00:54:26.927]  If we're willing to let the government look at us naked, there's probably not much left that we wouldn't be willing to allow them to do.
[00:54:27.387 --> 00:54:30.909]  And that's why they want to force this through on us, this act of domination.
[00:54:30.929 --> 00:54:34.450]  I mean, if we capitulate to this, then the sky's the limit.
[00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:37.772]  I think there's certainly an argument to be made in that direction.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:43.283]  John, we wrote an article at PrisonPlanet.com called, Big Sis Caught Lying to American People.
[00:54:43.703 --> 00:54:50.907]  A, she says the machines are safe, even though the federal government itself and John Hopkins, she cites John Hopkins as saying it's safe.
[00:54:51.347 --> 00:54:58.772]  Meanwhile, John Hopkins, head of the Radiation Department, Radiology Department, is in the French News Agency, in AP, saying it's very dangerous.
[00:54:59.432 --> 00:55:01.413]  She lies and says they can't save the image.
[00:55:01.733 --> 00:55:04.655]  We have the owner's manual of the machines, they do save the images.
[00:55:05.115 --> 00:55:06.096]  Now they've leaked
[00:55:06.716 --> 00:55:10.120]  Images from the federal marshals when they were naked body scanning.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.362]  That's top story on Drudge.
[00:55:11.902 --> 00:55:14.165]  What's your view on the lies of Big Sis?
[00:55:15.446 --> 00:55:16.167]  I think it's terrible.
[00:55:16.187 --> 00:55:24.177]  I mean, I don't know how we're supposed to trust that they have our best interests at heart when everything they say, you know, three or four months later turns out to not be true.
[00:55:26.803 --> 00:55:38.345]  Well, what about TSA three weeks ago announced the enhanced pat-downs and said they would touch the crotch and breast, and then when there was heat, they said a week later, oh, we don't touch your crotch, even though it's on the news, them doing it.
[00:55:38.405 --> 00:55:40.406]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are, John?
[00:55:40.866 --> 00:55:43.706]  Well, I think people can judge for themselves based on what they hear.
[00:55:46.847 --> 00:55:47.407]  Incredible.
[00:55:49.008 --> 00:55:51.448]  Well, we're going to find out if the anger continues.
[00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:53.048]  I only see an intensifying.
[00:55:53.108 --> 00:55:54.229]  I think we're going to win this thing.
[00:55:54.469 --> 00:55:55.869]  Yeah, I certainly hope you're right.
[00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:59.071]  What does your gut tell you, John?
[00:55:59.692 --> 00:56:04.596]  Well, I was telling you during the break, at least right now, I mean, it's hard for me to tell how big this story is.
[00:56:04.656 --> 00:56:12.724]  I haven't been able to watch any media for the past three days, so I kind of have to trust your word for you, you know, take your word for it if you say that the anger is intensifying.
[00:56:14.668 --> 00:56:15.008]  It is.
[00:56:15.288 --> 00:56:18.970]  It is intensifying, and I mean, here's another lie.
[00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:21.911]  She says the pat-downs are private and discreet.
[00:56:22.211 --> 00:56:25.772]  They do them out in full view, and they're not private or discreet.
[00:56:25.832 --> 00:56:27.693]  I mean, it's just a culture of lies, John.
[00:56:27.713 --> 00:56:39.137]  Well, in their defense, at least, they do offer a private room, and they did offer me a private room, and I declined it because if I wasn't going to allow to be pat-down, I wanted everybody to see exactly what it is that they do.
[00:56:40.731 --> 00:56:46.493]  Well, more than that, I've interviewed some sexual assault victims and others, and I've seen other interviews.
[00:56:46.853 --> 00:56:49.334]  They say it's even scarier to have this done privately.
[00:56:49.814 --> 00:56:51.995]  So that's why they want it to be done out in the open as well.
[00:56:52.015 --> 00:56:53.816]  Yeah, I certainly understand that.
[00:56:55.656 --> 00:56:57.157]  Well, tell us about your blog.
[00:56:57.737 --> 00:56:59.478]  How can folks check that out?
[00:56:59.538 --> 00:57:09.021]  They can go to johnnyedge.blogspot.com and they can see the original article that I wrote alongside the videos and some follow-up stuff I wrote to clarify exactly what took place.
[00:57:10.512 --> 00:57:15.355]  Well, if more people record the TSA, and if more people confront them, they're not going to get away with this.
[00:57:17.176 --> 00:57:27.682]  Finally, what's your take on these big lobbyists like Alphonse D'Amato, the former senator and the former head of Homeland Security, Chertoff, heading up the companies that make billions off of this?
[00:57:27.742 --> 00:57:34.486]  I mean, he puts in the orders to buy the machines, and then the head of Homeland Security goes to become the head of the company.
[00:57:34.826 --> 00:57:38.268]  Yeah, there's certainly something shady about that whole thing.
[00:57:39.318 --> 00:57:42.879]  It certainly looks untoward, even if it's not.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.221]  Well, I think it's a conflict of interest any way you slice it.
[00:57:47.561 --> 00:57:48.801]  Yeah, I would agree with that.
[00:57:50.061 --> 00:57:51.902]  Well, great having you on.
[00:57:51.962 --> 00:57:59.324]  Hopefully, as this case unfolds, especially if they keep persecuting you, hopefully we'll be able to get you back on the show.
[00:57:59.384 --> 00:58:03.326]  But overall, let's hope that they back down and do the same thing.
[00:58:03.366 --> 00:58:07.687]  But maybe it's better for them to try to persecute you, John, because then it really shows their true colors.
[00:58:08.107 --> 00:58:10.408]  I've had people send that opinion to me.
[00:58:10.428 --> 00:58:15.929]  You know, they say, hey, no offense, but I really hope you get sued because I'd love to see this go to court and actually have some case law come out of it.
[00:58:16.009 --> 00:58:17.029]  So we'll see what happens.
[00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:21.150]  I mean, I certainly don't want to face a fine, but I'm willing to face it if that's what it comes to.
[00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:22.931]  So you're not rolling over to Big Brother?
[00:58:23.191 --> 00:58:23.351]  No.
[00:58:24.271 --> 00:58:24.591]  All right.
[00:58:24.651 --> 00:58:27.812]  John Tyner, another great American standing up against tyranny.
[00:58:28.152 --> 00:58:29.633]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[00:58:30.193 --> 00:58:30.553]  Good luck.
[00:58:30.733 --> 00:58:31.213]  Godspeed.
[00:58:31.233 --> 00:58:31.673]  All right.
[00:58:31.693 --> 00:58:31.913]  Thanks.
[00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:33.134]  Be right back.
[00:58:33.154 --> 00:58:33.494]  Stay with us.

[00:58:49.235 --> 00:58:50.196]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:50.496 --> 00:58:54.200]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.642]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:58:56.662 --> 00:59:02.107]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:02.527 --> 00:59:08.773]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:09.193 --> 00:59:14.717]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:15.177 --> 00:59:18.859]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:23.342]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:23.642 --> 00:59:29.146]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:29.586 --> 00:59:32.548]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:33.148 --> 00:59:34.549]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.550]  It's here.

[01:00:04.758 --> 01:00:05.558]  You want answers?
[01:00:06.339 --> 01:00:07.240]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:11.545]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.086 --> 01:00:16.150]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:30.455]  Okay, we're continuing with this revolt against the TSA and their takeover of society.
[01:00:31.476 --> 01:00:33.578]  In 30 minutes, we've got Owen J.J.
[01:00:33.618 --> 01:00:51.233]  Stone, techie, who was on the This Week in Tech with Leo Laporte, and we didn't just believe him, we went and did a search and found newscasts admitting they don't just stick their finger in your waistband now, they stick your hand all the way in, touching his rear end and then his genitals.
[01:00:52.759 --> 01:00:57.262]  That video is up on our backup YouTube channel, the 1776 channel.
[01:00:57.582 --> 01:01:00.023]  We're also going to get it linked up on the Alex Jones channel.
[01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.905]  And Paul Watson's doing a story on this right now.
[01:01:03.405 --> 01:01:05.666]  Here's another one, and I see these every week or two.
[01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:09.729]  TSA Agent 45 rapes 14-year-old girl.
[01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:13.431]  What do you expect, folks?
[01:01:14.331 --> 01:01:20.035]  I'm not saying they're all pedophiles, or even 10% of them are, but I've studied criminology.
[01:01:21.237 --> 01:01:27.842]  Took a little bit of it in college, but have read mainline textbooks since I got out of college to understand the enemy.
[01:01:28.783 --> 01:01:36.568]  And you know, truancy officers, police officers, CPS, that's where you find the highest concentrations of pedophiles.
[01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:44.174]  You also find the highest concentration in school teachers, in priests, in anybody who's got access to children.
[01:01:45.875 --> 01:01:46.716]  It doesn't mean that
[01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.953]  You know, even 10% of people that want to work with children are bad.
[01:01:50.993 --> 01:01:52.934]  It just means that's where you're going to find the pedophiles.
[01:01:53.894 --> 01:01:55.455]  And so here's another report on that.
[01:01:56.456 --> 01:01:58.057]  That's from before it's news.
[01:01:59.458 --> 01:02:00.959]  They've got the local newscast there.
[01:02:01.419 --> 01:02:06.782]  The Transportation Security Administration worker at Logan International Airport is accused of assaulting a 14-year-old girl.
[01:02:07.903 --> 01:02:14.167]  Sean Shanahan, 45, of Winthrop, is being held on a $50,000 cash bail following his arraignment.
[01:02:15.239 --> 01:02:22.241]  In East Boston District Court, he is charged with the statutory rape enforcement of a child and indecent assault and battery on a 14-year-old.
[01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:27.102]  We've got another big report.
[01:02:29.643 --> 01:02:31.804]  Watson does now have his report out.
[01:02:31.824 --> 01:02:34.044]  We need to get this out to Drudge and everybody else.
[01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:36.825]  TSA now putting hands down flyers' pants.
[01:02:37.425 --> 01:02:38.545]  Big Sis turns up the heat.
[01:02:38.605 --> 01:02:40.326]  New enhanced pat-downs, more intrusive.
[01:02:42.862 --> 01:02:45.485]  I would say new, enhanced, enhanced.
[01:02:45.705 --> 01:02:47.547]  This is now phase three.
[01:02:48.088 --> 01:02:49.509]  New, super enhanced.
[01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.132]  Let's get Watson on the horn and change that.
[01:02:52.612 --> 01:02:53.994]  New, enhanced, enhanced.
[01:02:54.094 --> 01:02:55.215]  People understand it's a new one.
[01:02:56.877 --> 01:03:01.882]  TSA, invasive, new screening measures include officers literally putting their hands down people's pants.
[01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:03.804]  So we got a guest coming on about that.
[01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:06.775]  Good job on Watson getting that out so quickly.
[01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:12.956]  But I've got an article coming out tomorrow dealing with the fact of, is this the start of the Second American Revolution?
[01:03:14.197 --> 01:03:17.997]  And I was starting to get into that before we had John Tyner on.
[01:03:20.018 --> 01:03:24.918]  You see in the movie, V for Vendetta, and that's based on historical composites of things that have happened.
[01:03:26.519 --> 01:03:33.500]  When the little girls dressed up like Guy Fawkes and the cop shooter in the back and adult men see it, they just go, that's it, that's it.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:42.166]  And look, it's just once you don't care, once a society doesn't care and gets out of their cowed state, we can sweep anything aside.
[01:03:43.727 --> 01:03:47.611]  And the truth is, most of the military and the police are good people.
[01:03:47.851 --> 01:03:49.292]  They know what's going on is wrong.
[01:03:50.253 --> 01:03:55.018]  See, the deeper the denial, the more angry you're going to be when you wake up from it.
[01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:57.634]  Kind of like I said two years ago with Obama.
[01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:59.834]  I said the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:05.076]  The bigger the messianic hype he's got, he's going to save us, the harder he's going to fall.
[01:04:05.677 --> 01:04:09.278]  Six months into his administration, lowest approval rating ever for a president, six months in.
[01:04:10.778 --> 01:04:13.780]  He's now almost two years in, record low level.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.720]  The guy is dirt.
[01:04:16.221 --> 01:04:20.022]  Washington Post yesterday, what we told you two months ago, we know what we're talking about.
[01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:23.781]  Some people know football, or some people know gardening.
[01:04:24.022 --> 01:04:25.182]  We know this stuff.
[01:04:25.523 --> 01:04:26.263]  This is what we do.
[01:04:26.644 --> 01:04:28.285]  I told you he's probably not going to run again.
[01:04:29.406 --> 01:04:34.330]  Now, high power Democratic Party people in the Washington Post say, don't run again, Mac.
[01:04:35.411 --> 01:04:36.592]  Don't run again, Mac.
[01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:39.414]  It's the same thing with this TSA.
[01:04:39.774 --> 01:04:40.655]  I smell blood.
[01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:42.016]  I smell weakness.
[01:04:42.076 --> 01:04:43.858]  It's kind of like Brock Lesnar two weeks ago.
[01:04:45.623 --> 01:04:49.649]  When he finally got hit in the jaw and got dizzy, that guy smelled blood and took him down.
[01:04:49.669 --> 01:04:50.631]  It's the same thing.
[01:04:50.651 --> 01:04:51.492]  I smell it!
[01:04:52.233 --> 01:04:52.874]  I smell it!
[01:04:53.154 --> 01:04:54.296]  New World Order blood!
[01:04:54.316 --> 01:04:55.218]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.974 --> 01:05:00.595]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:00.935 --> 01:05:09.056]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:09.796 --> 01:05:13.837]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:14.417 --> 01:05:25.239]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:25.879 --> 01:05:34.882]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:35.382 --> 01:05:40.444]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:47.987]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:48.307 --> 01:05:51.048]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:59.810]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:00.211 --> 01:06:03.193]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:03.434 --> 01:06:08.238]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:08.258 --> 01:06:14.463]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:14.624 --> 01:06:16.866]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:17.686]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:17.706 --> 01:06:18.127]  Bernanke?
[01:06:18.227 --> 01:06:18.707]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:18.727 --> 01:06:19.508]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:19.548 --> 01:06:21.669]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:43.208]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:43.588 --> 01:06:52.698]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:54.707 --> 01:06:58.930]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:59.250 --> 01:06:59.850]  Number 1.
[01:07:00.151 --> 01:07:03.313]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:03.593 --> 01:07:04.133]  Number 2.
[01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:08.997]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:09.337 --> 01:07:09.777]  It's true.
[01:07:10.077 --> 01:07:14.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:15.501]  Number 3.
[01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:19.063]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:19.363 --> 01:07:23.066]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:23.266 --> 01:07:23.807]  Number 4.
[01:07:24.067 --> 01:07:26.429]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:30.192]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:30.512 --> 01:07:30.713]  Number 5.
[01:07:31.293 --> 01:07:35.216]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:35.437 --> 01:07:40.201]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:40.481 --> 01:07:44.505]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:44.666 --> 01:07:46.207]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:46.448 --> 01:07:48.530]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:51.313]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:51.533 --> 01:08:01.684]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:16.960]  Okay, I want to open the phones up in this segment and the next segment and then into the third hour today.
[01:08:18.481 --> 01:08:24.222]  Now the top Drudge Report headline is TSA now putting hands down flyers' pants.
[01:08:26.083 --> 01:08:38.767]  So that went live at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com about 10 minutes ago and Drudge already has it up as the mega top giant headline link.
[01:08:41.124 --> 01:08:42.265]  I mean, that is amazing.
[01:08:42.325 --> 01:08:46.287]  TSA now putting hands down Flyers' pants.
[01:08:46.547 --> 01:08:49.068]  Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[01:08:49.629 --> 01:08:50.849]  DrudgeReport.com.
[01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:54.411]  I've only had the top super link one time.
[01:08:55.192 --> 01:08:57.613]  I mean, we've had the top of Drudge's little links many times.
[01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:59.194]  We now have the super mega link.
[01:08:59.754 --> 01:09:04.057]  And again, if I had the super mega link and I'd written about
[01:09:06.284 --> 01:09:10.245]  Uh... Prince Henry or Prince Twitley or whatever his name is.
[01:09:10.265 --> 01:09:15.826]  What's the name of that... that... Saxe-Coburg-Gotha creature?
[01:09:19.066 --> 01:09:20.226]  What's the name of that princeling?
[01:09:22.587 --> 01:09:22.867]  I don't know.
[01:09:22.927 --> 01:09:24.887]  It's the big news today all over the place.
[01:09:25.567 --> 01:09:29.828]  One of Prince Charles' rat-like children is getting married.
[01:09:30.768 --> 01:09:31.748]  Okay, Prince William.
[01:09:31.788 --> 01:09:32.348]  Okay, thank you.
[01:09:32.388 --> 01:09:33.349]  See, I don't know about this stuff.
[01:09:33.909 --> 01:09:35.209]  If I would have had an article
[01:09:36.730 --> 01:09:44.212]  Linked on Drudge Report, the biggest website in the world, about Prince Henry, I wouldn't care.
[01:09:45.372 --> 01:09:47.033]  Or Prince William, or whatever his name is.
[01:09:47.633 --> 01:09:52.554]  But I do care about this because it's important.
[01:09:52.934 --> 01:09:54.455]  I want to be able to fly.
[01:09:55.235 --> 01:09:57.675]  I want to take my children to the Smithsonian.
[01:09:58.716 --> 01:09:59.616]  They would have already been there.
[01:10:00.723 --> 01:10:04.426]  I want to take my children to Disneyland once.
[01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:05.727]  They beg to go all the time.
[01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:11.091]  I want to be able to take my children to the Florida Keys to go snorkeling like I did as a child.
[01:10:11.671 --> 01:10:14.233]  I want to be able to take my children to Colorado.
[01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:16.875]  But if I want to do that, I've got to drive.
[01:10:17.695 --> 01:10:22.859]  And so I've got to add basically two weeks on to a vacation that would be a week long.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.461]  And I can't take off two, three weeks.
[01:10:26.562 --> 01:10:29.464]  I rarely, maybe once a year, take off a full week.
[01:10:30.618 --> 01:10:39.624]  And then I'll generally just stay at home and spend time with my children and play board games and, you know, take them to movies or go hiking or go out to eat dinner.
[01:10:39.644 --> 01:10:46.209]  And we've got a fire pit in the backyard and we'll sit out there and roast marshmallows or hot dogs or whatever the case may be.
[01:10:46.949 --> 01:10:53.353]  I want to be able to take my children flying, but you are not going to put your hands on my daughters or my son.
[01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:55.275]  I can't physically handle it.
[01:10:55.295 --> 01:10:56.015]  Do you understand that?
[01:10:56.656 --> 01:10:58.477]  And again, I don't claim to be Mr. Tough Guy.
[01:11:00.663 --> 01:11:02.824]  But, there's certain things I can't handle.
[01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:06.547]  I've got a very long fuse, unless it comes to my children.
[01:11:08.128 --> 01:11:09.409]  And I think most of us are like that.
[01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:11.743]  But you do something to my children.
[01:11:11.763 --> 01:11:25.413]  I mean, I see these newscasts where children are crying, and the men and women are grabbing between their legs, and grabbing their rear end, and grabbing their chest, and these little girls and boys are crying, and the parents are sitting there yelling at them, saying, put up with it.
[01:11:26.013 --> 01:11:30.897]  I mean, these parents have lost all of their basic instincts to defend their family.
[01:11:33.899 --> 01:11:38.022]  If you want to comment on the economic news, the TSA situation, any of it,
[01:11:39.309 --> 01:11:40.089]  You're welcome to.
[01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:42.290]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:43.070]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:43.150]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:49.093]  I may have finally gotten rid of my cold if I sound a bit dingy on air, or a bit more toad-like than normal.
[01:11:49.113 --> 01:11:50.993]  But I finally got a fever last night.
[01:12:07.413 --> 01:12:11.656]  And the bed was soaked with sweat this morning, and my fever broke about 6 a.m.
[01:12:13.957 --> 01:12:15.618]  And I say, I finally got a fever.
[01:12:15.658 --> 01:12:19.940]  I've had this chest cold for two weeks with no fever, and haven't been able to get rid of it.
[01:12:21.841 --> 01:12:22.942]  And I rarely get sick.
[01:12:23.862 --> 01:12:27.044]  And finally, I got really sick last night, and I was glad.
[01:12:27.084 --> 01:12:27.725]  I was shivering.
[01:12:28.085 --> 01:12:29.265]  I wrapped myself in blankets.
[01:12:29.306 --> 01:12:29.906]  I had a fever.
[01:12:29.926 --> 01:12:31.627]  I'm like, oh, thank God I've got a fever.
[01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.628]  Maybe I'll start getting better now.
[01:12:33.868 --> 01:12:35.089]  And I feel a lot better today.
[01:12:36.288 --> 01:12:37.288]  Because that's what a fever does.
[01:12:37.328 --> 01:12:41.329]  It raises your temperature to kill whatever it is growing in my lungs.
[01:12:41.969 --> 01:12:43.750]  And it seems like half of Austin's got it.
[01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:48.111]  And I'm sorry to... I'm sorry to get off into this because I got a lot of news and things to cover.
[01:12:48.151 --> 01:12:52.592]  It's just that my wife yesterday... Hold on one minute.
[01:12:55.153 --> 01:12:58.633]  My wife yesterday and today begged me to stay home and get better.
[01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:04.535]  But how do I stay home and get better when all of this is happening?
[01:13:07.352 --> 01:13:14.155]  How do I stay home and not be on air in what could be the start of the second American Revolution?
[01:13:15.375 --> 01:13:19.037]  Tyrannies get overthrown when cops shoot a kid.
[01:13:19.057 --> 01:13:23.599]  There have been real cases of that all over the world in the last hundred years.
[01:13:25.539 --> 01:13:29.621]  Not just in V for Vendetta when they shoot the little girl and everybody overthrows the government.
[01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:40.669]  But I've been looking for a peaceful way, as Mahatma Gandhi talked about, and Martin Luther King talked about, to say no to this federal encroachment.
[01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:43.370]  No to these big private central banks raping us.
[01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:54.774]  And by the people having an effect, and by Napolitano now coming out and saying, okay, we won't search 12 and unders.
[01:13:55.255 --> 01:13:55.975]  That was this morning.
[01:13:56.755 --> 01:13:58.576]  And she also announced, okay,
[01:14:00.049 --> 01:14:05.173]  The pilots just have to have their ID checked to make sure that they are who they say they are.
[01:14:05.453 --> 01:14:06.434]  That makes perfect sense.
[01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:10.738]  You're about to fly a plane with 300 people on it or 200 people on it.
[01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:12.379]  It could be used as a weapon.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.943]  Totally reasonable to check your ID, make sure you're who you say you are.
[01:14:19.264 --> 01:14:20.686]  It's the same thing for citizens.
[01:14:23.228 --> 01:14:24.609]  If you don't have a criminal record,
[01:14:26.661 --> 01:14:31.862]  And especially if you've flown a lot in the past, you shouldn't have to go through any screening.
[01:14:34.563 --> 01:14:37.604]  And this is going with the official story that the terrorism is real.
[01:14:38.484 --> 01:14:45.386]  I mean, if the terror is real, why aren't Arabs and Muslims the only people being profiled?
[01:14:47.677 --> 01:14:48.658]  See, it's a fraud.
[01:14:49.278 --> 01:14:53.081]  Why are our borders wide open if we're supposedly under this terrorist attack?
[01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.964]  But, oh, at the airports alone we've got to have all this security.
[01:14:59.807 --> 01:15:00.968]  So, a lot of really
[01:15:02.788 --> 01:15:03.989]  Exciting things happening.
[01:15:04.829 --> 01:15:06.630]  This came out about 20 minutes ago.
[01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.450]  Ethics Committee finds Rangel guilty.
[01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.211]  That's CNN.
[01:15:10.231 --> 01:15:17.394]  A House Ethics Committee found Representative Charlie Rangel, Democrat of New York, guilty Monday on multiple violations of House rules.
[01:15:18.575 --> 01:15:21.516]  So the beginning of the end for Charlie Rangel.
[01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:24.097]  But our story
[01:15:27.213 --> 01:15:29.995]  TSA now putting hands down flyers' pants.
[01:15:30.456 --> 01:15:31.977]  Big Sis turns up the heat.
[01:15:32.558 --> 01:15:36.281]  New, super-enhanced pat-downs, more invasive.
[01:15:37.762 --> 01:15:44.027]  And the video of all of that is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in that article.
[01:15:44.548 --> 01:15:47.250]  Or, the easiest place to find it is DrudgeReport.com.
[01:15:48.391 --> 01:15:52.715]  You just go to DrudgeReport.com and it's the giant
[01:15:56.249 --> 01:16:00.132]  Giant Top Link, get ready, now putting hands down flyers' pants.
[01:16:00.152 --> 01:16:10.139]  You know, he went with the InfoWars version, which is fine, but the Prison Planet version has that sub-headline that describes it better.
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:14.002]  Big Sis turns up the heat, new enhanced pat-downs more intrusive.
[01:16:14.022 --> 01:16:14.763]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:16:15.343 --> 01:16:19.626]  The information is now
[01:16:20.973 --> 01:16:22.817]  is now getting out there and that's what matters.
[01:16:23.758 --> 01:16:26.544]  And they're beginning to cave in on all of this.
[01:16:26.604 --> 01:16:27.746]  That's what's important as well.
[01:16:28.207 --> 01:16:29.469]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:16:30.311 --> 01:16:32.154]  Let's go ahead and talk to Julio in Illinois.
[01:16:32.194 --> 01:16:33.096]  Julio, thanks for holding.
[01:16:33.136 --> 01:16:33.417]  Welcome.
[01:16:34.668 --> 01:16:36.389]  Alex, man, this is huge.
[01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:41.630]  I've got my roommate all fired up about the molesters at TSA.
[01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.891]  I'm proud of John.
[01:16:42.911 --> 01:16:45.892]  I'm proud of everyone who's taking a stand against this.
[01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.853]  I'm never going to fly until these machines are gone.
[01:16:48.933 --> 01:16:50.333]  I'm planning on taking the train.
[01:16:50.633 --> 01:16:51.554]  But then again, who knows?
[01:16:51.614 --> 01:16:53.874]  Maybe Napolitano will bring the full body scanners.
[01:16:54.274 --> 01:16:55.815]  No, no, they're already announcing Pat.
[01:16:55.835 --> 01:16:59.896]  They've already done pat-downs and searches randomly at trains for at least five years.
[01:16:59.936 --> 01:17:01.537]  That's expanding right now.
[01:17:02.466 --> 01:17:04.146]  Quickly, Alex, this is huge.
[01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:08.067]  Last year we defeated Copenhagen and you popped champagne on your show.
[01:17:08.848 --> 01:17:25.732]  I'm not sure if you know this or if this wasn't on your mind, but I believe in two weeks' time in Cancun, Mexico, the scum of the United Nations will cave in on the Mexican police state and will start up their world government talks with the Cancun Agreement to try to
[01:17:26.252 --> 01:17:27.533]  Clamped down on world government.
[01:17:27.553 --> 01:17:32.436]  I don't know if you could bring Lord Christopher Montanon to give us an update on what's going to go on in Cancun.
[01:17:32.476 --> 01:17:33.757]  Of course, the Mockingbird Media.
[01:17:34.037 --> 01:17:35.057]  Well, get this, Alex.
[01:17:35.438 --> 01:17:38.199]  NBC is doing Green is Universal, which is interesting.
[01:17:38.239 --> 01:17:46.284]  The media is setting this up two weeks in advance, and they're doing their propaganda pieces on global warming and climate change, setting up for the Cancun meetings.
[01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:54.013]  Yes, we've been covering that in the last few months, but I do need to get Christopher Monckton back on.
[01:17:54.333 --> 01:18:01.897]  He's the real expert, and I believe he may even be traveling down to Cancun, where these scallywags are going to be meeting.
[01:18:01.917 --> 01:18:03.558]  Julio, great points.
[01:18:03.878 --> 01:18:04.699]  Good to hear from you.
[01:18:04.719 --> 01:18:06.520]  Appreciate the call.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.461]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:18:08.501 --> 01:18:09.221]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:18:09.241 --> 01:18:11.422]  T-S-A.
[01:18:11.703 --> 01:18:13.644]  Tyranny starts at the airports.
[01:18:14.024 --> 01:18:18.006]  My question to you, Alex, today, where are the county sheriffs?
[01:18:18.484 --> 01:18:23.727]  And why aren't they involving themselves as the highest elected public servant in the counties where these airports are located?
[01:18:24.007 --> 01:18:41.037]  Well, what's happened is the feds came in with their mission creep and they signed agreements civilly with the airports and with the airlines to get people to just civilly consent to this fraud, but because local tax money
[01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:44.698]  In every case is paying for the airports.
[01:18:45.098 --> 01:18:49.999]  There is local city and county jurisdiction and that would then revert to the sheriff.
[01:18:50.439 --> 01:18:51.339]  And that's a great point.
[01:18:51.619 --> 01:19:00.682]  And I actually in Texas have heard the state police on the news and legislators and legislators also in New Jersey and now federally.
[01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:01.362]  That's in the news.
[01:19:01.822 --> 01:19:04.522]  The Republicans, I talked to Ron Paul's office yesterday.
[01:19:05.243 --> 01:19:06.403]  We're trying to get him on next week.
[01:19:07.163 --> 01:19:09.384]  He's going to introduce a bill to just get rid of all of this.
[01:19:10.065 --> 01:19:11.205]  So the battle is on.
[01:19:11.245 --> 01:19:12.086]  The heat is on.
[01:19:12.106 --> 01:19:18.429]  Now, you better believe that the globalists are going to mail a few more bombs and try to scare us into submission.
[01:19:18.909 --> 01:19:21.690]  And we need to say, look, the borders are wide open.
[01:19:21.871 --> 01:19:23.872]  28,000 dead on the U.S.-Mexico border.
[01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:25.392]  That's the real crisis.
[01:19:26.253 --> 01:19:34.157]  You know, we'd rather face the danger, as Americans have said in polls, than be patted down by the real danger, government tyranny.
[01:19:34.557 --> 01:19:35.257]  Good points, Tim.
[01:19:37.358 --> 01:19:41.241]  Jonas, John, Frank, and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:19:41.702 --> 01:19:47.887]  Then we have a gentleman coming on who's the subject of the top Drudge Report link right now.
[01:19:48.968 --> 01:19:52.851]  And that is Get Ready, now putting hands down flyers' pants.
[01:19:53.212 --> 01:19:54.193]  Top story on Drudge.
[01:19:55.413 --> 01:19:58.694]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:19:59.515 --> 01:20:03.737]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:04.017 --> 01:20:09.939]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:10.159 --> 01:20:12.320]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:18.543]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:18.683 --> 01:20:22.027]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:22.107 --> 01:20:23.809]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:23.969 --> 01:20:26.012]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:26.152 --> 01:20:30.838]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:31.038 --> 01:20:31.659]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:31.859 --> 01:20:35.904]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:36.124 --> 01:20:40.929]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:40.949 --> 01:20:42.090]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.811]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:54.997 --> 01:20:58.878]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:20:59.138 --> 01:21:03.078]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.
[01:21:03.138 --> 01:21:08.739]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, tow line, or boating.

[01:21:21.361 --> 01:21:24.122]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[01:21:24.622 --> 01:21:25.703]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:25.883 --> 01:21:30.266]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:30.446 --> 01:21:36.130]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:39.652]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:39.892 --> 01:21:42.494]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:42.714 --> 01:21:47.517]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:21:47.657 --> 01:21:47.898]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.918 --> 01:21:49.319]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.782 --> 01:21:59.645]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:21:59.745 --> 01:22:00.525]  What have we got?
[01:22:00.725 --> 01:22:02.866]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:22:03.186 --> 01:22:03.907]  A republic.
[01:22:04.187 --> 01:22:06.768]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:22:06.848 --> 01:22:08.749]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:22:09.089 --> 01:22:11.010]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:12.391]  So they think they own our land?
[01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:13.932]  They think they own our water?
[01:22:14.132 --> 01:22:14.532]  Children?
[01:22:14.732 --> 01:22:15.512]  Our education?
[01:22:15.853 --> 01:22:16.493]  Our money?
[01:22:16.673 --> 01:22:20.335]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:22:20.695 --> 01:22:24.380]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.341]  You're being warned.
[01:22:25.662 --> 01:22:26.503]  We have the facts.
[01:22:26.703 --> 01:22:27.804]  We have the Constitution.
[01:22:27.864 --> 01:22:28.746]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:22:28.766 --> 01:22:29.587]  We have common law.
[01:22:29.647 --> 01:22:31.910]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:32.170 --> 01:22:35.955]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:22:36.055 --> 01:22:40.837]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:22:40.997 --> 01:22:42.378]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:22:42.498 --> 01:22:43.338]  Don't tread on me.
[01:22:43.598 --> 01:22:50.461]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:54.463 --> 01:22:56.525]  A new way to improve your health has arrived.
[01:22:56.845 --> 01:23:01.810]  Your body's primary nutrient for detoxification and antioxidant power is glutathione.
[01:23:02.291 --> 01:23:07.055]  Glutathione mops up heavy metals and toxins of all kinds and carries them to the liver for elimination.
[01:23:07.536 --> 01:23:11.540]  Glutathione neutralizes free radicals, which keeps your cells younger and stops inflammation.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:15.602]  Glutathione gives you a strong immune system and gives you greater athletic endurance.
[01:23:16.022 --> 01:23:20.024]  The problem is your body's natural production declines due to age and toxins.
[01:23:20.384 --> 01:23:23.686]  What's your body's best way to produce strong and youthful levels of glutathione?
[01:23:24.086 --> 01:23:26.027]  It's One World Whey Protein Powder.
[01:23:26.607 --> 01:23:29.288]  One World Whey Protein Powder is an industry first.
[01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:32.490]  It comes from grass-fed cows and is never heated.
[01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:40.877]  This miraculous whey protein powder supplies your body with the nutrient power to increase your glutathione production by as much as 64% or more.
[01:23:41.338 --> 01:23:45.361]  The increase in strength, energy, and well-being can be pronounced and amazing.
[01:23:45.741 --> 01:23:46.002]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:46.022 --> 01:23:46.322]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:46.342 --> 01:23:47.423]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:24:16.254 --> 01:24:27.478]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:24:27.498 --> 01:24:28.779]  Let's talk to Brad in Michigan.
[01:24:28.819 --> 01:24:29.639]  Brad, you're on the air.
[01:24:29.679 --> 01:24:32.100]  Hello?
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:32.761]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:33.521 --> 01:24:34.041]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:34.061 --> 01:24:34.621]  How are you doing?
[01:24:34.741 --> 01:24:35.422]  I'm doing all right.
[01:24:36.202 --> 01:24:37.783]  I hate to stray away from the TSA.
[01:24:38.143 --> 01:24:39.483]  Very big news.
[01:24:39.723 --> 01:24:42.504]  Glad to hear everybody's not, you know, licking boots on this.
[01:24:44.628 --> 01:24:47.270]  My question, Alex, really is I wanted your opinion.
[01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:53.255]  Me and a couple friends were debating the whole 9-11 and this new uncovered footage you covered yesterday and a lot of this.
[01:24:53.896 --> 01:25:01.602]  And I was wondering, is it possible that the plane brought down in Pennsylvania by the citizens on that plane that crashed?
[01:25:01.622 --> 01:25:02.763]  I believe it was in Pennsylvania.
[01:25:02.783 --> 01:25:04.444]  They claim it was for the White House.
[01:25:05.105 --> 01:25:05.785]  Is that possible?
[01:25:05.825 --> 01:25:07.867]  That plane was really meant for Tower 7?
[01:25:08.087 --> 01:25:11.390]  You know, three buildings, three sets of explosives, three planes.
[01:25:12.093 --> 01:25:20.020]  Well, if you look at the trajectory, the plane was going in the direction at the time it was shot down or brought down.
[01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:26.585]  In the general direction, it could have gone to New York or it could have gone to Virginia.
[01:25:27.065 --> 01:25:30.028]  It was going in that general direction, so we don't know.
[01:25:30.268 --> 01:25:32.149]  And we all like to believe
[01:25:33.177 --> 01:25:33.297]  That's
[01:25:48.723 --> 01:26:00.850]  State police and other witnesses at the time said they saw F-16s and an explosion, and the debris field on that jet was eight miles, and the crater at Shanksville wasn't even an engine.
[01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:02.851]  I mean, it was a little bitty crater.
[01:26:02.911 --> 01:26:10.535]  That was not where the whole plane crashed, and that would be indicative of a missile, multiple missiles,
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.781]  Breaking the plane up in, you know, up in the atmosphere, and then it raining down.
[01:26:16.641 --> 01:26:31.625]  And Bush now said in his new memoir, his new book that's out, Decision Point, I think's the name of it, but I've read the quotes from his book online, that he thought a missile had shot it down because he'd ordered it shot down.
[01:26:32.825 --> 01:26:37.026]  So, we know from Pentagon sources,
[01:26:39.352 --> 01:26:40.753]  It was Colonel Don DeGramperie.
[01:26:40.793 --> 01:26:41.813]  He died shortly after.
[01:26:41.833 --> 01:26:56.781]  And then later, I confirm most of this, that it was the happy hooligans out of the Dakotas who were on drill in Virginia that day, and that they fired out of a F-16 two AIM-9s, or Sidewinders, into that aircraft.
[01:26:57.581 --> 01:27:00.582]  And so we don't know the truth.
[01:27:01.743 --> 01:27:06.245]  But we know the official story is a lie, though.
[01:27:06.765 --> 01:27:07.226]  Anything else?
[01:27:07.646 --> 01:27:07.826]  Yeah.
[01:27:08.536 --> 01:27:12.398]  I mean, hands down it's evident, even with all the YouTube footage alone.
[01:27:12.718 --> 01:27:19.800]  What really makes me sick is there's men in prison doing life for murder with less evidence than what we have on 9-11 right now.
[01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.841]  And that to me is just sickening.
[01:27:22.121 --> 01:27:26.003]  I've seen Bush on Oprah promoting his new book and I just maybe want to puke.
[01:27:26.123 --> 01:27:31.065]  He is just the most tyrannical, evil individual I've ever seen.
[01:27:31.885 --> 01:27:35.527]  And I just think we really need to push for the 9-11.
[01:27:37.065 --> 01:27:37.385]  Definitely.
[01:27:37.405 --> 01:27:39.967]  Congratulations to building1.org.
[01:27:39.987 --> 01:27:40.607]  Keep pushing.
[01:27:41.408 --> 01:27:43.209]  We are.
[01:27:43.249 --> 01:27:44.169]  We are pushing, Brad.
[01:27:44.209 --> 01:27:44.810]  God bless you.
[01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:46.491]  Jonas in Illinois.
[01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:47.051]  You're on the air.
[01:27:47.071 --> 01:27:49.593]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:49.633 --> 01:27:50.814]  How are you doing?
[01:27:51.674 --> 01:27:51.854]  Good.
[01:27:51.894 --> 01:27:52.274]  Go ahead.
[01:27:52.314 --> 01:27:54.936]  First, I wanted to say I think you're doing a really good job.
[01:27:55.176 --> 01:27:55.837]  I'm a veteran.
[01:27:56.377 --> 01:27:57.738]  I have a degree in finance.
[01:27:57.858 --> 01:27:59.379]  I'm in my last year of law school now.
[01:28:00.379 --> 01:28:05.282]  Your message is really starting to get out there with this TSA incident thing.
[01:28:06.969 --> 01:28:07.409]  I agree with you.
[01:28:07.429 --> 01:28:09.331]  I think the sleeping giant is starting to wake up.
[01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:12.553]  And I'm almost wondering if that's what the government wants.
[01:28:12.573 --> 01:28:14.034]  You know, you talk about these FEMA camps.
[01:28:14.655 --> 01:28:18.618]  Is this just a pretext or was it a pretext to actually fill those FEMA camps up?
[01:28:19.919 --> 01:28:22.140]  Well, look, there's a lot of different pretexts.
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.861]  There could be a biological attack.
[01:28:24.822 --> 01:28:26.463]  There could be a giant terror attack.
[01:28:26.984 --> 01:28:29.646]  There could be a political uprising that's violent.
[01:28:30.746 --> 01:28:32.087]  There could be a big war.
[01:28:32.668 --> 01:28:33.749]  There are a lot of different
[01:28:35.097 --> 01:28:40.841]  They always prime the camps, whether it's Russia or Germany or China, with a politically unpopular group.
[01:28:41.381 --> 01:28:46.965]  So they always put Jews in them first, or communists, or religious minorities.
[01:28:48.165 --> 01:28:57.551]  I've seen the former head of the CIA, Woolsey and others, propose putting all Muslims in camps, or putting all the illegal immigrants in camps, but they admit in Rex 84,
[01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:10.236]  That once the precedent is set with the unpopular group in the camp, now that secret police network is set up, now due process is shelved.
[01:29:11.697 --> 01:29:15.759]  And once all of that is shelved, then they start going after everybody.
[01:29:16.499 --> 01:29:19.020]  Because the tyrants want to consolidate power.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.641]  They want to take over industries.
[01:29:21.101 --> 01:29:22.482]  They want to go after everybody.
[01:29:23.182 --> 01:29:26.964]  But they always set the precedent first on an unpopular minority.
[01:29:27.424 --> 01:29:28.345]  And that's what's going on here.
[01:29:29.252 --> 01:29:37.018]  Also, what I was saying, hey, you know, I hear you plugging Drudge Report a lot, and I've got a news aggregation website myself.
[01:29:37.518 --> 01:29:39.740]  It's daily-ops.com.
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:41.181]  Daily is the mining site.
[01:29:41.261 --> 01:29:41.441]  OPS.com.
[01:29:41.541 --> 01:29:44.423]  And I've been citing it to you all the time.
[01:29:44.443 --> 01:29:44.984]  That's awesome.
[01:29:45.224 --> 01:29:46.124]  We're on the march.
[01:29:46.605 --> 01:29:48.226]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:49.147 --> 01:29:51.829]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.069 --> 01:29:59.032]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:29:59.272 --> 01:30:05.317]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:05.677 --> 01:30:12.783]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:30:13.063 --> 01:30:17.647]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:48.002]  It's HomeGain.com.
[01:31:48.483 --> 01:31:51.045]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[01:31:51.345 --> 01:31:52.126]  Check them out today.
[01:31:54.767 --> 01:31:58.071]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:58.351 --> 01:31:59.432]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:59.652 --> 01:32:03.837]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:32:04.057 --> 01:32:09.703]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:32:10.004 --> 01:32:11.986]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:32:12.146 --> 01:32:14.829]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:21.475]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:32:21.655 --> 01:32:23.476]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:32:23.877 --> 01:32:28.961]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:32:29.222 --> 01:32:34.166]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:32:34.486 --> 01:32:39.689]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:32:39.849 --> 01:32:42.830]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:32:43.050 --> 01:32:46.011]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:32:46.051 --> 01:32:47.052]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:32:58.171 --> 01:32:58.872]  Big Brother.
[01:32:59.153 --> 01:33:00.455]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:00.835 --> 01:33:02.017]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:02.217 --> 01:33:03.179]  You want answers?
[01:33:03.479 --> 01:33:04.541]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:05.563 --> 01:33:09.449]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:13.837 --> 01:33:17.199]  We have the top link, the big giant link on Drudge Report.
[01:33:17.239 --> 01:33:17.799]  Get ready.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.881]  Now putting hands down flyers' pants.
[01:33:21.782 --> 01:33:27.005]  And InfoWars.com has giant servers, but I guess having the biggest link on Drudge.
[01:33:27.045 --> 01:33:30.667]  I've seen that before, even shut down the Associated Press website.
[01:33:31.408 --> 01:33:33.869]  InfoWars.com is not loading too quick.
[01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:38.913]  So if you want to read the story, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:39.733 --> 01:33:51.140]  We're trying to do a redirect right now when the Drugs Report links to InfoWars to send you to a mirror at PrisonPlanet.com for everybody on that front.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:54.802]  But this story, of course,
[01:33:56.132 --> 01:33:57.933]  deals with Owen J.J.
[01:33:57.993 --> 01:34:00.754]  Stone, known as the O-Doctor.
[01:34:01.474 --> 01:34:07.616]  He's the founder of Men's Medium and Odoctor.com.
[01:34:07.856 --> 01:34:13.538]  He's a speaker and commentator in the areas of social media, technology, and politics.
[01:34:14.439 --> 01:34:17.820]  And I came in this morning and saw a video clip
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:20.102]  of course.
[01:34:30.635 --> 01:34:34.976]  I'd already seen some other newscast and we did a search and found more with people reporting.
[01:34:35.456 --> 01:34:36.916]  It's like enhanced, enhanced.
[01:34:36.956 --> 01:34:38.017]  It's like super enhanced.
[01:34:38.577 --> 01:34:44.738]  If you're supposedly wearing baggy clothes now, they don't just stick their finger in, they stick their whole hand in and go around your hind end.
[01:34:45.438 --> 01:34:47.999]  Then they come up and grab your crotch, but from outside.
[01:34:48.019 --> 01:34:53.160]  And he told the story on this week in tech.
[01:34:54.375 --> 01:35:04.565]  of what happened to him and we've got him live with us here in just a moment, but I wanted to play that video clip again right now before we go to him of his testimony.
[01:35:04.585 --> 01:35:10.551]  They'll have him break it down in more detail here on this syndicated broadcast, but here is Owen J.J.
[01:35:10.591 --> 01:35:11.873]  Stone talking about what happened to him.
[01:35:12.413 --> 01:35:13.674]  No, no, no, I'm not.
[01:35:13.734 --> 01:35:14.015]  I'm not.
[01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:14.395]  I'm not.
[01:35:14.495 --> 01:35:17.337]  Because I am fundamentally opposed to the x-ray machines.
[01:35:17.377 --> 01:35:20.180]  And in fact, I don't know, they had recently, or is it coming up?
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.283]  Wednesday, November 24th, 2010 is National Opt-Out Day.
[01:35:24.563 --> 01:35:27.806]  Now most people don't know, on the x-ray machines, you can always opt out.
[01:35:27.906 --> 01:35:30.589]  All you have to say is, I opt out, and then they give you a pat-down search.
[01:35:31.309 --> 01:35:32.329]  And if we all did it?
[01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:33.690]  I do that all the time, regardless.
[01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:34.410]  Air traffic would stop.
[01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:34.990]  Well, listen.
[01:35:35.010 --> 01:35:35.370]  Well, maybe.
[01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.730]  I don't know.
[01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:39.292]  When I just flew here this weekend, I wore the same sweatpants I wore last week to go to LA.
[01:35:39.712 --> 01:35:42.933]  This year, this weekend when I came in, he's like, oh, they just changed the rules this week.
[01:35:43.313 --> 01:35:45.474]  Do you want a private screening or do you want us to patch you down out here?
[01:35:45.494 --> 01:35:46.134]  And I'm like, what do you mean?
[01:35:46.154 --> 01:35:46.454]  He's like,
[01:35:47.354 --> 01:35:49.796]  Well, do you want us to take you in the back room or do you want us to do it out here?
[01:35:49.836 --> 01:35:50.457]  What does it entail?
[01:35:50.697 --> 01:35:52.859]  I have to go in your waistband, put my hand down your pants.
[01:35:52.879 --> 01:35:54.000]  I'm like, do it out here.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.722]  And I stood in front of everybody and he did it.
[01:35:56.842 --> 01:35:57.582]  What's the alternative?
[01:35:57.602 --> 01:35:58.503]  Can I go through a machine?
[01:35:59.064 --> 01:36:01.045]  No, the alternative is for him to go in the back room and pat.
[01:36:01.405 --> 01:36:03.387]  He's gonna put his hands down your pants no matter what?
[01:36:03.407 --> 01:36:03.988]  He did, yes.
[01:36:04.648 --> 01:36:07.489]  And I said, I'd rather have him do it out here in public, because just what Brian said.
[01:36:08.169 --> 01:36:10.530]  He's already ashamed to do it, and I feel like he's not going to go as deep.
[01:36:10.570 --> 01:36:11.310]  When did this happen?
[01:36:11.410 --> 01:36:12.010]  This weekend!
[01:36:12.190 --> 01:36:14.431]  They're required to put their hands down your pants?
[01:36:14.451 --> 01:36:15.271]  They just changed the rule!
[01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:17.772]  He put his hands on the... Wait a minute!
[01:36:17.812 --> 01:36:19.252]  You're blowing my mind here!
[01:36:22.233 --> 01:36:28.397]  This is the new TSA, is that you have to get... If you're wearing sweatpants or baggy clothing... Oh, baggy clothing.
[01:36:28.538 --> 01:36:29.238]  I was wearing sweatpants.
[01:36:29.258 --> 01:36:30.539]  They're not baggy, they're sweatpants.
[01:36:30.899 --> 01:36:32.380]  He put his hand... This is my waistband.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.403]  Because I gotta tell you, if I have to get somebody to hand me down my pants, I'm not playing.
[01:36:35.423 --> 01:36:40.466]  He ran his hand around the ring of my waistband, and then patted the front, and then patted my butt, and then in my crotch.
[01:36:40.506 --> 01:36:41.787]  And you know, it's all security theater.
[01:36:41.807 --> 01:36:43.128]  It does absolutely nothing.
[01:36:43.268 --> 01:36:48.592]  That's the part that kills me, is that for all of the federalization, for all of this giant bureaucracy, for the five dollars...
[01:36:49.195 --> 01:36:50.603]  Let's go to Owen J.J.
[01:36:50.684 --> 01:36:51.146]  Stone.
[01:36:51.851 --> 01:36:53.037]  Owen, good to have you on with us.
[01:36:55.732 --> 01:36:56.412]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:36:56.452 --> 01:36:57.153]  Nice to meet you.
[01:36:57.513 --> 01:37:00.534]  So, break down your story.
[01:37:00.734 --> 01:37:02.895]  It is the top story now up on the Drudge Report.
[01:37:02.935 --> 01:37:05.556]  TSA now putting hands down flyers' pants.
[01:37:05.717 --> 01:37:13.460]  And we took a short clip of you talking about it, but then added a clip from another newscast admitting it, just in case people were in denial.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:17.782]  Because three weeks ago, TSA announced they would touch genitals and breasts.
[01:37:18.422 --> 01:37:21.584]  And then when there was backlash, TSA said, we're not touching genitals.
[01:37:22.464 --> 01:37:29.830]  And it's just this culture of lying, but give us your take overall on what the TSA is doing, and then tell us what happened to you.
[01:37:30.592 --> 01:37:34.454]  Well, first of all, in general, I fly maybe 20 to 30 times a year.
[01:37:34.554 --> 01:37:35.754]  So I'm a frequent flyer.
[01:37:36.235 --> 01:37:37.595]  I do not carry any liquids.
[01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:39.136]  I don't even carry deodorant.
[01:37:39.256 --> 01:37:40.417]  I check all of that stuff.
[01:37:40.617 --> 01:37:43.498]  I go to a local market and buy, like, the trial size.
[01:37:43.678 --> 01:37:46.399]  I never ship flyers with anything at all.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.641]  And I don't go through with any metal, no watches, no phone, nothing.
[01:37:49.701 --> 01:37:51.362]  So when I go through, I never beep.
[01:37:51.562 --> 01:37:53.203]  I haven't beeped in years.
[01:37:53.443 --> 01:37:54.503]  So, you know, I know I fly.
[01:37:54.523 --> 01:37:55.224]  I don't want to get beeped.
[01:37:55.844 --> 01:37:59.245]  So I flew 10 days ago into L.A.
[01:37:59.446 --> 01:38:00.306]  wearing the same clothes.
[01:38:01.118 --> 01:38:02.139]  I was wearing the same sweatpants.
[01:38:02.179 --> 01:38:05.222]  Now, I went through, it didn't beep, but he said, oh, your sweatpants are a little baggy.
[01:38:05.242 --> 01:38:06.022]  We're going to pat you down.
[01:38:06.042 --> 01:38:08.244]  They did the regular tap, tap, barely touch you.
[01:38:08.264 --> 01:38:09.065]  Go ahead.
[01:38:09.806 --> 01:38:15.651]  This weekend, I fly up to San Francisco wearing the exact same outfit because I travel a lot, so I wear the same kind of clothes.
[01:38:16.071 --> 01:38:18.093]  So if I didn't have a problem then, I shouldn't have a problem now.
[01:38:18.773 --> 01:38:20.335]  And a guy comes up.
[01:38:20.495 --> 01:38:23.737]  They made me wait there for 10 minutes in the little box, which usually doesn't happen.
[01:38:23.758 --> 01:38:24.678]  They come in real quick.
[01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:26.660]  He says, oh, we're going to take you in our private room.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.842]  And I said, for what?
[01:38:29.437 --> 01:38:30.638]  We're going to have to pat you down.
[01:38:30.658 --> 01:38:31.758]  I'm like, well, they always pat me down.
[01:38:31.798 --> 01:38:32.478]  Just pat me down right here.
[01:38:32.498 --> 01:38:35.000]  He's like, oh, I'm going to have to go inside of your pants.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.640]  I'm like, what?
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:37.701]  He's like, I have to.
[01:38:37.821 --> 01:38:38.701]  It's a new rule.
[01:38:38.781 --> 01:38:39.702]  It's a different kind of search.
[01:38:39.742 --> 01:38:41.903]  So I was like, well, what are my options?
[01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:46.425]  You know, and he said, well, I could pat you down out here, or I could do it in a private room.
[01:38:46.445 --> 01:38:48.105]  He's like, you probably prefer a private room.
[01:38:48.986 --> 01:38:51.107]  And I looked at him like, there's no way I'm going anywhere.
[01:38:51.727 --> 01:38:52.547]  All my stuff's here.
[01:38:52.567 --> 01:38:54.368]  You know, I travel with electro equipment.
[01:38:54.408 --> 01:38:56.089]  I'm not packing up all my stuff at all.
[01:38:56.429 --> 01:38:57.289]  I'll do it right here.
[01:38:57.710 --> 01:38:58.410]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:38:58.993 --> 01:39:03.937]  So, uh, he got down on his knees, and he started patting me down the regular way.
[01:39:04.337 --> 01:39:06.339]  Then he said, okay, now I'm gonna stick my hand on your pants.
[01:39:07.019 --> 01:39:13.764]  And literally to his wrist, his hand went in my, in my waistband, around my crotch, around my butt, twice.
[01:39:14.745 --> 01:39:20.429]  Then he went on the outside, pat down, on front and back, and then he put his hand back down in front of my pants to, like, grab at my crotch.
[01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:21.891]  Like, to feel in between my legs.
[01:39:22.131 --> 01:39:22.771]  Excuse me.
[01:39:23.572 --> 01:39:26.094]  The hand was inside on your crotch.
[01:39:26.698 --> 01:39:31.419]  Yeah, not inside my underwear, but inside my pants.
[01:39:31.459 --> 01:39:44.623]  He was feeling the front of my thighs, and the whole time the guy was saying, I'm sorry, I'm a fairly big guy, I'm overweight, and I'm like 6 foot tall, and he was like 5'4 maybe, and he had like the fear of him, because I was just hot.
[01:39:44.983 --> 01:39:47.744]  So he just said, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, and I'm just thinking,
[01:39:48.766 --> 01:39:50.126]  What would happen if you took me in a room?
[01:39:50.486 --> 01:39:52.267]  You know, because he was already embarrassed to do it.
[01:39:52.387 --> 01:39:59.969]  You know, apparently, you know, they just changed the rules so he hasn't had weeks of time doing this or practicing or, you know, have his mind set on, hey, this is what I do.
[01:40:00.429 --> 01:40:03.349]  So he was embarrassed to do it and apologetic to do it.
[01:40:03.930 --> 01:40:11.891]  But at the same time, I'm like, wow, I'm going to have to start wearing, like, like Speedos or something to the airport.
[01:40:11.911 --> 01:40:14.932]  So he knows that I'm not carrying anything.
[01:40:15.032 --> 01:40:16.293]  I don't know.
[01:40:16.993 --> 01:40:18.193]  I don't know how women are going to put up with it.
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:19.641]  I have no clue.
[01:40:21.543 --> 01:40:33.733]  Well you teach your children don't let strangers touch you and now three weeks ago I was at an airport in California and I watched nothing but women and children put through for some reason in the four scanners.
[01:40:34.214 --> 01:40:39.078]  Then they would call them out and touch between their legs, touch their breasts.
[01:40:39.578 --> 01:40:42.181]  I saw this being done to babies in baby carriages.
[01:40:42.201 --> 01:40:43.662]  My daughters
[01:40:44.761 --> 01:40:45.342]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:03.066 --> 01:41:05.269]  I don't even know.
[01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:07.732]  I heard the clip earlier and it raised my heart.
[01:41:07.773 --> 01:41:12.479]  I don't know how someone could stand there and let their child scream and be violated by a stranger.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.022]  Who knows what that's going to do to that child?
[01:41:14.122 --> 01:41:15.023]  It won't happen to my child.
[01:41:15.504 --> 01:41:16.545]  I can't imagine.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:23.681]  But if they can get away with this, Owen, they can get away with anything.
[01:41:23.741 --> 01:41:31.783]  I mean, clearly this is being done to train us and condition us to have the government in our business, the government putting their hands on our bodies.
[01:41:32.303 --> 01:41:47.247]  Are you aware of the fact that TSA, for at least five, six years, but now they're expanding it, has viper teams, is what they call them, and mobile vans, and mobile body scanners, not just in federal and state courthouses, and that they're openly announcing
[01:41:48.047 --> 01:41:56.001]  They want to put them in malls, and just everywhere you go, there'll be federal goons outside their jurisdiction, randomly searching us.
[01:41:56.823 --> 01:41:58.666]  Meanwhile, the southern border is wide open.
[01:42:00.564 --> 01:42:09.355]  I heard about that, and I firmly believe it now because I think that this pat-down, this invasive pat-down, is just a step to scare people.
[01:42:09.675 --> 01:42:15.202]  So the normal pat-down didn't make people think, oh, I'll go through these x-ray machines and get radiation that I don't know anything about.
[01:42:15.222 --> 01:42:18.406]  I mean, when I go to the doctor, the dentist, people put metal plates on my chest.
[01:42:18.946 --> 01:42:19.246]  I don't know.
[01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:40.140]  I don't trust people.
[01:42:40.361 --> 01:42:41.221]  I don't trust you, Alex.
[01:42:41.282 --> 01:42:42.523]  I just met you five minutes ago.
[01:42:42.863 --> 01:42:47.589]  I'm not going to give you access to something of mine just to say, oh, you're going to take care of that.
[01:42:47.869 --> 01:42:48.810]  Who can trust anybody?
[01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:54.577]  Do you trust that they're going to delete your picture of your breasts, your genitals, no matter who you are?
[01:42:54.957 --> 01:43:08.201]  Well, by the way, it's now come out on Gizmodo today, through a FOIA request, that the 35,000 images at one federal courthouse in Florida, they released hundreds of them, and it shows that they were saving them.
[01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:10.002]  They were making jokes about it.
[01:43:10.322 --> 01:43:13.143]  They've been caught in England saving them as well.
[01:43:13.763 --> 01:43:21.086]  So they have now been caught red-handed doing this, and they also have
[01:43:22.336 --> 01:43:44.238]  All of these major scientific bodies, including groups in the federal government, saying that there is a danger of radiation in these scanners, and then Napolitano, Janet Napolitano, comes out and says, A, this is not invasive, the pat-downs, when it clearly is, B, there's no danger,
[01:43:45.479 --> 01:43:46.700]  C, from the radiation.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.703]  C, we're not saving the images and the machines can't save the images.
[01:43:51.003 --> 01:43:58.929]  When we have the owner's manual, I wrote about this a year and a half ago at PrisonPlanet.com, where they admit they save the images.
[01:43:59.249 --> 01:44:00.390]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:11.479]  And now they've announced they want to start saving the scan to use it as biometrics to identify, just like they can scan your retina or your face or your thumb, to scan your whole body.
[01:44:11.759 --> 01:44:12.860]  That's a market watch.
[01:44:14.395 --> 01:44:15.655]  I'll never go through a nose machine.
[01:44:16.296 --> 01:44:20.357]  And if they ever want to pat me down, I'll have them do it in public.
[01:44:20.417 --> 01:44:29.199]  Because, again, when other people see what's going on, and if somebody gets a little too frisky, then they're obligated to calm down because people are in the view.
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:32.120]  If you wanted to take me to the back room, why would you even give me that option?
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.621]  If you're not doing anything wrong, why not do it out here?
[01:44:35.001 --> 01:44:37.063]  Why say, do you want to go in a private room?
[01:44:37.103 --> 01:44:38.144]  Why do I need to go in a private room?
[01:44:38.184 --> 01:44:38.944]  We about to make love?
[01:44:39.325 --> 01:44:40.746]  We got cigarettes and candles back there?
[01:44:40.946 --> 01:44:42.868]  There's no reason for you to do that.
[01:44:43.048 --> 01:44:46.831]  And again, it's a scare tactic, because once you go in that room, I'm in a tiny little box.
[01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:52.916]  And I start feeling nervous about what's going on when I got two or three men looking at me while another guy's touching me.
[01:44:53.991 --> 01:44:54.672]  Well, let's just...
[01:45:10.014 --> 01:45:11.155]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:45:11.735 --> 01:45:20.502]  You and I and many others, months ago, I'd said on air, clearly they're going to enhance pat-downs to intimidate you to make you use the machines.
[01:45:20.963 --> 01:45:24.265]  Then the TSA admittedly told Atlantic Monthly,
[01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:33.654]  And other major publications in the last two weeks that, oh, we're not worried about the enhanced pat-downs because nobody's going to go for them.
[01:45:34.435 --> 01:45:36.636]  This is meant to make you go through the machine.
[01:45:37.016 --> 01:45:39.698]  So they admit this has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:45:40.578 --> 01:45:41.499]  Just what you said.
[01:45:41.839 --> 01:45:44.740]  They're trying to intimidate you to go through the machines.
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:50.884]  And then it turns out Alphonse D'Amato, the former senator, a lobbyist, and Chertoff, the former head of Homeland Security,
[01:45:51.824 --> 01:45:56.766]  Chertoff, two and a half years ago, made the first order for several billion dollars of the machines.
[01:45:57.486 --> 01:46:02.048]  Then he leaves office and goes and becomes the CEO of the company.
[01:46:02.468 --> 01:46:04.169]  And he consults for the other company.
[01:46:04.549 --> 01:46:05.670]  I mean, that's illegal!
[01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:10.211]  He makes the order for the machines, then he goes and gets the job as the head of the company.
[01:46:10.492 --> 01:46:11.452]  Is that not a payoff?
[01:46:13.735 --> 01:46:14.295]  It has to be.
[01:46:14.736 --> 01:46:15.216]  It has to be.
[01:46:15.436 --> 01:46:22.538]  The funny thing that kills me about whenever someone brings up terrorism at airports, I say no one in the government cares about terrorism at airports.
[01:46:22.938 --> 01:46:24.099]  Okay, I fly all the time.
[01:46:24.999 --> 01:46:26.840]  LAX, one of the biggest airports in the world.
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:35.363]  You know what stops you from running onto the tarmac and throwing up a grenade or a bomb or an automatic weapon and shooting down a plane when it goes to land or takes off?
[01:46:35.903 --> 01:46:36.643]  A chain link fence.
[01:46:37.645 --> 01:46:48.974]  And they've got, you know, 30 cop cars and squad cars checking underneath your car for bombs because, yeah, a terrorist is going to put a bomb underneath his car and drive him to the airport because... No, this is police state training, exactly.
[01:46:48.994 --> 01:46:50.715]  They don't want to stop anything.
[01:46:50.895 --> 01:46:53.317]  If they wanted to stop it, they'd have protection all around the airport.
[01:46:53.337 --> 01:46:54.218]  There's no protection.
[01:46:54.358 --> 01:47:07.069]  Well, Owen, it came out last week on ABC News that illegal aliens can walk right in and rent aircraft for training and the TSA gives them waivers and no security background check.
[01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:15.656]  Anybody who had a truck bomb could just drive into the cargo area with no checkpoints and drive right up to the fence and blow it up.
[01:47:16.176 --> 01:47:16.836]  Absolutely!
[01:47:17.156 --> 01:47:34.163]  They are training the public, when you pull up in front of the airport, and when you go into the airport, to be a slave, to be searched, to be checked, to have your genitals groped, to have your hind end grabbed, to have your wife's breasts grabbed, to have your children grabbed, for police state America.
[01:47:34.383 --> 01:47:36.624]  That's all this is, is dog training.
[01:47:38.936 --> 01:47:43.138]  Well, somebody's gonna have to get an electronic leash on, because that's what they want us to do.
[01:47:43.438 --> 01:47:51.521]  I mean, again, if it was all about terrorism, there's so many things that this country could do, besides fighting wars in other countries, to build up our own defenses here at home.
[01:47:51.821 --> 01:47:53.061]  I don't care about the rest of the world.
[01:47:53.141 --> 01:47:53.842]  I care about home.
[01:47:53.922 --> 01:47:56.563]  And apparently, you don't have enough guards on duty to protect us at home.
[01:47:56.863 --> 01:47:58.503]  That tells me that you don't care about terrorism.
[01:47:59.084 --> 01:48:00.464]  You know, it's just like the war on drugs.
[01:48:00.824 --> 01:48:03.765]  You say something, everybody claps, and then they put their head down and forget about it.
[01:48:04.145 --> 01:48:05.386]  Well, this airplane stuff,
[01:48:06.173 --> 01:48:14.660]  There's going to be women that have been sexually molested, have been violated in their lives, that are going to freak out if another woman or someone tries to put their hands on them.
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:17.082]  Because it's very invasive.
[01:48:17.122 --> 01:48:21.105]  Like, again, I'm sitting there as a grown man thinking, well, what happens if I get excited?
[01:48:21.325 --> 01:48:22.887]  This guy's grabbing off all my stuff.
[01:48:22.907 --> 01:48:25.048]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:48:25.329 --> 01:48:28.531]  Whose job is it that they think that they can just do that and it'd be okay?
[01:48:28.831 --> 01:48:35.437]  I mean, from a week ago, they train you in a week and say, okay, now you're going to start lifting off genitals and grabbing butts.
[01:48:35.938 --> 01:48:39.670]  And putting your hands in people's pants 30, 40, 100, 2000 times a day.
[01:48:40.151 --> 01:48:41.175]  And who says okay to that?
[01:48:41.215 --> 01:48:42.117]  What kind of person are you?
[01:48:42.734 --> 01:48:43.675]  That's what you want to do.
[01:48:43.695 --> 01:48:45.236]  You want to touch children.
[01:48:45.256 --> 01:48:47.417]  You want to touch old women or men.
[01:48:47.597 --> 01:48:51.860]  I mean, or look at naked pictures of people that you have no idea who they are all day.
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:53.161]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:48:53.561 --> 01:48:54.602]  That was my next question.
[01:48:56.403 --> 01:48:58.204]  Is who wants this job?
[01:48:58.264 --> 01:49:02.347]  I mean, you said this guy kept apologizing to you because he knows it's wrong.
[01:49:02.687 --> 01:49:10.012]  Even a big brother says it's right to have his hand down in your pants, on your underwear, on the front of your underwear.
[01:49:10.212 --> 01:49:11.293]  I mean, describe that.
[01:49:11.613 --> 01:49:13.535]  What did he do to your junk?
[01:49:13.555 --> 01:49:16.338]  Like you were his wife?
[01:49:36.457 --> 01:49:37.839]  Hey baby, how you doing there?
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:38.900]  Exactly.
[01:49:39.161 --> 01:49:40.222]  Um, two pads.
[01:49:40.663 --> 01:49:42.885]  And then, when he went back in the front, he did the same thing.
[01:49:42.925 --> 01:49:44.928]  Like, he padded in between my crotch.
[01:49:45.629 --> 01:49:46.851]  Right around my area.
[01:49:47.331 --> 01:49:48.212]  Let's be specific.
[01:49:48.252 --> 01:49:51.537]  You're saying he padded on your underwear, your testicles?
[01:49:53.306 --> 01:50:06.775]  Unbelievable, and I apologize to radio listeners, we don't normally get into these type of things, but we have to talk about it when the government... I don't even want to spray it, that's how embarrassing it is, because even when I was on Leo's show, when I said, I was like, you know, he freaked out, like, you touched your pipe?
[01:50:06.795 --> 01:50:07.355]  I was like, yes!
[01:50:07.776 --> 01:50:09.477]  And who wants to even spray it?
[01:50:10.137 --> 01:50:11.218]  Let alone have it done to you.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:17.442]  What do you think about your story now being the top link on Drudge Report?
[01:50:18.615 --> 01:50:23.178]  Well, at least people know about it, so I'm happy about that because I was blown away.
[01:50:23.198 --> 01:50:29.582]  I literally, I almost freaked out because I told the guy three times, I'm like, I just flew five days ago.
[01:50:29.983 --> 01:50:31.464]  I'm wearing the exact same clothes.
[01:50:31.764 --> 01:50:34.486]  I'm thinking, what is the difference between then and now?
[01:50:34.986 --> 01:50:37.588]  You know, I wish I would have known.
[01:50:37.628 --> 01:50:38.749]  I would have worn different clothes.
[01:50:39.429 --> 01:50:40.650]  I would dress more appropriately.
[01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:42.051]  I had another flight to come home.
[01:50:42.611 --> 01:50:45.113]  I wore a short and a t-shirt.
[01:50:45.253 --> 01:50:46.014]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:50:46.054 --> 01:50:47.795]  Let's come right back and finish up your story.
[01:50:48.195 --> 01:50:48.876]  It doesn't matter.
[01:50:48.896 --> 01:50:50.477]  They're always adding more, more, more.
[01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:51.478]  More, more, more.
[01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:52.098]  Training us.
[01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:53.820]  Seeing what they can get away with.
[01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:56.542]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:56.582 --> 01:51:01.926]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:02.166 --> 01:51:06.790]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:07.190 --> 01:51:07.590]  It's true.
[01:51:07.670 --> 01:51:10.252]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:10.472 --> 01:51:12.214]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:12.754 --> 01:51:17.436]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:17.976 --> 01:51:24.879]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:25.079 --> 01:51:25.979]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:26.199 --> 01:51:32.562]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:32.882 --> 01:51:35.724]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:36.064 --> 01:51:37.966]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:39.147 --> 01:51:39.347]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:39.387 --> 01:51:42.389]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:42.869 --> 01:51:44.611]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:55.094 --> 01:51:56.055]  Go solar for cheap!
[01:51:56.275 --> 01:51:58.416]  Want to use solar power but the price is too high?

[01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:33.776]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:52:33.816 --> 01:52:34.556]  This capitalism?
[01:52:34.616 --> 01:52:40.761]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:52:40.881 --> 01:52:41.702]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:52:41.762 --> 01:52:44.864]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:52:45.005 --> 01:52:45.805]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:47.166]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:52:47.226 --> 01:52:47.507]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:47.547 --> 01:52:47.807]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:52:54.392 --> 01:52:59.236]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:52:59.576 --> 01:53:01.878]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:53:02.118 --> 01:53:09.404]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:53:09.684 --> 01:53:12.146]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:53:12.186 --> 01:53:18.991]  I started taking hardened body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:53:19.251 --> 01:53:24.255]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:24.455 --> 01:53:29.338]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:29.558 --> 01:53:33.600]  Order at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:38.142]  That's hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:38.682 --> 01:53:42.044]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:53:42.064 --> 01:53:46.726]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:46.766 --> 01:53:50.608]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:59.522 --> 01:54:04.784]  He's known as the O-Doctor.
[01:54:05.824 --> 01:54:09.746]  Briefly, tell us a little bit about yourself, Owen, Owen J.J.
[01:54:09.786 --> 01:54:22.251]  Stone, and your website, what you work on, you know, dealing with tech stuff, and then let's get back into the points you were trying to finish up before we went to break.
[01:54:23.719 --> 01:54:36.129]  Long story short, on the business end, I run Inquire Minds Media and we do consulting and web design and strategy for the internet, social campaigns, the Facebook, the Twitter, promoting people and such.
[01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:48.738]  I also do odaka.com where I do interviews, live Q&A sessions every Wednesday where I have guests on and people can ask them questions about their industry or their profession and that's pretty much it.
[01:54:48.758 --> 01:54:51.080]  So I'm all over the web and I'm in the tech space.
[01:54:51.801 --> 01:54:53.782]  Getting on fun shows and having a good time.
[01:54:53.802 --> 01:54:57.144]  That's why something like this, again, what he said earlier, like, who wants to talk about it?
[01:54:57.304 --> 01:55:00.866]  I mean, it's embarrassing, but if you don't say it, the people won't know about it.
[01:55:00.886 --> 01:55:07.429]  That's why I'm happy that it is on the Dredge Report right now and that people are talking about it, that I got to say it on Leo's show and listeners are aware.
[01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:09.511]  I mean, Leo's about to go fly to Paris.
[01:55:09.811 --> 01:55:10.511]  He took me aside.
[01:55:10.531 --> 01:55:11.852]  I was like, are you serious with my casting?
[01:55:12.012 --> 01:55:15.554]  They do that stuff, so it's nice that the awareness is getting around about it.
[01:55:18.055 --> 01:55:42.885]  I see this as a historical revolt, though, because there was already simmering anger over the TSA and the humiliation and the slave training, but now that they're trying to intensify it, and more and more people are going public, the mainstream media is going from making fun of people that criticize it to Time Magazine headline, Everybody Hates the TSA, the Chicago Tribune, Government in Your Pants.
[01:55:43.365 --> 01:55:45.846]  Forbes Magazine, abolish the TSA.
[01:55:46.326 --> 01:55:49.827]  I mean, this is a complete rout of these people.
[01:55:50.367 --> 01:55:53.228]  And Big Sis is like, okay, we won't search the pilots.
[01:55:53.649 --> 01:55:55.049]  Okay, we won't search kids.
[01:55:55.389 --> 01:56:02.231]  But I guarantee you, in a few months, she's going to come back and try to put it back in place, because bullies want to dominate.
[01:56:02.272 --> 01:56:03.472]  They want to set that precedent.
[01:56:05.141 --> 01:56:13.626]  Well, I'm just waiting for all these mainstream media pundits and people to get paid to say what they're supposed to say, the monkeys in the media, to get searched.
[01:56:14.106 --> 01:56:21.690]  You know, I want an anchorman or an anchorwoman to go through on one of their business trips and have someone put their hand down their pants or feel them up.
[01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:22.591]  And that's how they feel.
[01:56:22.851 --> 01:56:26.893]  And then see how comfortable they feel reading some crap from a teleprompter
[01:56:27.373 --> 01:56:32.178]  The American public, because until it happens to you, it's easy to say, oh, it's a big, it's not a big deal.
[01:56:32.479 --> 01:56:33.420]  It's about our security.
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:36.763]  Well, if they want security, I see gun turns all around the airport.
[01:56:36.843 --> 01:56:37.925]  That would make me feel secure.
[01:56:38.425 --> 01:56:43.551]  Not a dog and a van with a mirror looking underneath my car.
[01:56:44.455 --> 01:56:45.896]  Um, when I go to the airport.
[01:56:46.456 --> 01:56:48.277]  They don't care about your security.
[01:56:48.497 --> 01:56:50.678]  They care about these machines and making us money.
[01:56:51.038 --> 01:56:54.239]  At the airport, as soon as they get you accustomed to it, they are going to put them in schools.
[01:56:54.779 --> 01:56:56.920]  Oh, because so many kids shoot kids at school.
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:01.382]  And it happens and it's terrible and it's bad, but that's not a terroristic plague on my country.
[01:57:01.402 --> 01:57:04.823]  Look, they're teaching you that you are the enemy.
[01:57:04.883 --> 01:57:06.324]  That's what this is all about.
[01:57:06.344 --> 01:57:12.006]  Yeah, we're the problem, even though they can't protect us in our own country and state.
[01:57:15.447 --> 01:57:17.368]  It's a power grab, simply put.
[01:57:18.649 --> 01:57:20.630]  What would you like to see happen with the TSA?
[01:57:23.232 --> 01:57:29.857]  I would like something more sophisticated besides the x-ray machine that showed my body part.
[01:57:30.317 --> 01:57:31.358]  Why don't they have something
[01:57:32.037 --> 01:57:34.258]  That really just does a metal detection scan.
[01:57:34.378 --> 01:57:40.300]  I mean, if that kid that went through there, obviously, what do they have on them that set off the metal detector twice?
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.420]  It's a child.
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:42.980]  Okay, they have a belt on.
[01:57:43.281 --> 01:57:45.521]  Why aren't you making more sophisticated metal detectors?
[01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:55.084]  You know, I just don't understand why you need to see people naked, look through their clothing, or violate them and touch them in places you're not supposed to touch them.
[01:57:55.144 --> 01:58:00.546]  And again, you should never, ever, ever be asked to take that screening in private.
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:04.803]  Because if you can't do it in public, then that means there's something wrong with it.
[01:58:05.823 --> 01:58:09.846]  If you can't do that in front of the hundreds of other people standing behind me, then there's something wrong with that.
[01:58:09.986 --> 01:58:11.548]  And that's where the procedure needs to change.
[01:58:11.568 --> 01:58:15.010]  To start with, there should never be a private screening.
[01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:19.814]  Because it shouldn't be anything that violates my well-being or the way I feel about myself.
[01:58:20.614 --> 01:58:21.535]  But that's not going to happen.
[01:58:21.695 --> 01:58:22.976]  Very well said.
[01:58:23.216 --> 01:58:24.217]  Very well said, Owen.
[01:58:24.617 --> 01:58:25.798]  Owen, we're going to break.
[01:58:26.138 --> 01:58:27.800]  You got anything else you want to add, or is that it?
[01:58:28.737 --> 01:58:29.877]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[01:58:30.038 --> 01:58:30.958]  I appreciate you.
[01:58:31.078 --> 01:58:33.779]  And everybody, live... I tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:33.819 --> 01:58:34.139]  Stay there.
[01:58:34.159 --> 01:58:34.940]  I want you to finish up.
[01:58:37.581 --> 01:58:39.421]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:41.002 --> 01:58:43.203]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:45.572 --> 01:58:50.957]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:52.198 --> 01:58:56.962]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:58:57.342 --> 01:59:04.128]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:08.232]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:10.134 --> 01:59:12.095]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:59:14.554 --> 01:59:18.435]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:59:19.155 --> 01:59:22.276]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:59:22.976 --> 01:59:23.796]  Others don't.
[01:59:24.216 --> 01:59:26.097]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:59:26.357 --> 01:59:27.857]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:28.137 --> 01:59:30.698]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:59:31.018 --> 01:59:37.279]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:59:37.639 --> 01:59:39.860]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.381]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:59:42.721 --> 01:59:43.581]  Others don't.
[01:59:47.955 --> 01:59:49.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:50.341 --> 01:59:53.108]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:59.898 --> 02:00:04.062]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:04.722 --> 02:00:05.523]  You want answers?
[02:00:06.304 --> 02:00:07.205]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:07.845 --> 02:00:11.468]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.049 --> 02:00:16.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.793 --> 02:00:20.957]  We're going to continue with your phone calls, get into the economic news, the police state news.
[02:00:23.695 --> 02:00:29.897]  They're trying to pass legislation to basically ban family farms and ranches without all these special new fees and fines.
[02:00:31.477 --> 02:00:32.118]  That's coming up.
[02:00:32.738 --> 02:00:34.438]  That bill's very close to passing again.
[02:00:35.318 --> 02:00:41.700]  Senate Bill S-1050, Food Safety Modernization Act, vote imminent without law gardening and saving seeds.
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:42.861]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:00:42.921 --> 02:00:43.821]  It's actually in the bill.
[02:00:44.741 --> 02:00:47.702]  You got kids having the police called on them for selling cupcakes.
[02:00:48.342 --> 02:00:50.143]  Little girls can't have a lemonade stand.
[02:00:51.676 --> 02:01:01.444]  All over the country kids can't have American flags because the illegal aliens hate the country so much that they demand the flags be taken down and the teachers agree the flags are removed.
[02:01:01.925 --> 02:01:06.128]  This country's a joke and as citizens we better get mad and get angry.
[02:01:07.029 --> 02:01:12.353]  We do need to add to Paul Joseph Watson's article that's on PrisonPlanet.com, top-linked on Drudge,
[02:01:13.394 --> 02:01:19.178]  Drudge was crashing InfoWars, so we made it redirect to a Prison Planet mirror of the same article.
[02:01:20.198 --> 02:01:22.940]  We have an ad server on InfoWars that's always causing problems.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:26.142]  It doesn't do it on Prison Planet, so we linked over there.
[02:01:26.823 --> 02:01:30.225]  But we need to update this and say that we've now interviewed Owen J.J.
[02:01:30.265 --> 02:01:33.107]  Stone, a.k.a.
[02:01:33.167 --> 02:01:42.333]  the O-Doctor, because now he's, like he said on the show, he didn't want to get into detail, but it was worse, that they actually patted
[02:01:43.479 --> 02:01:43.799]  Pat it?
[02:01:43.819 --> 02:01:46.521]  They didn't just touch his rear end, they patted it.
[02:01:47.161 --> 02:01:48.702]  Like, hey baby, you know, get on in there.
[02:01:49.262 --> 02:01:52.604]  And they put the hand in the front and gave him a little pat.
[02:01:52.624 --> 02:01:55.225]  I mean, and he said the guy was apologizing.
[02:01:55.846 --> 02:01:57.307]  Well, obviously he's apologizing.
[02:01:57.347 --> 02:01:58.207]  He knows it's wrong.
[02:01:58.327 --> 02:02:00.088]  Why does he have this job then, Owen?
[02:02:03.371 --> 02:02:04.672]  I have no idea why you have that job.
[02:02:04.692 --> 02:02:10.458]  Again, in my mind, regular normal human beings don't have this job.
[02:02:10.638 --> 02:02:18.087]  And the one thing that you asked me earlier, what I wanted to end with, is that I'm actually happy that this happened because most of the country and most of the world anymore is pacified by things.
[02:02:18.667 --> 02:02:22.852]  And one of the things you don't mess with is children and your personal privacy.
[02:02:23.419 --> 02:02:25.019]  And nothing gets more personal.
[02:02:25.039 --> 02:02:26.460]  People tap phones, all that kind of stuff.
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:27.120]  Everything goes on.
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:31.241]  Nothing gets more personal than pictures of your naked body showing up somewhere.
[02:02:31.261 --> 02:02:35.802]  Nothing gets more personal than another adult touching you in a way that you don't want them touched.
[02:02:36.202 --> 02:02:37.802]  And especially when it happened with the children.
[02:02:38.202 --> 02:02:40.803]  So, go ahead and put these x-ray machines in.
[02:02:40.823 --> 02:02:41.963]  Go ahead and put them in schools.
[02:02:42.303 --> 02:02:45.064]  And that will finally set some people off to do something.
[02:02:45.084 --> 02:02:46.724]  Because this is outrageous.
[02:02:47.185 --> 02:02:47.845]  And it's egregious.
[02:02:48.045 --> 02:02:52.446]  I mean, at the end of the day, who wants someone else looking at them when they don't give them permission to do it?
[02:02:52.786 --> 02:02:53.066]  No one.
[02:02:53.863 --> 02:02:54.903]  No one wants it.
[02:02:54.923 --> 02:02:59.205]  If it were to happen in schools, who's looking at all these pictures, all these images?
[02:02:59.385 --> 02:02:59.865]  Pedophiles.
[02:03:00.385 --> 02:03:03.146]  You know, if I was a pedophile, why not sign up for a job?
[02:03:03.386 --> 02:03:04.726]  Remember Pennsylvania?
[02:03:06.147 --> 02:03:14.689]  Where the school was recording thousands of images of the laptops while the kids were at home dressing and undressing and in their own beds?
[02:03:15.049 --> 02:03:17.970]  And the school thought it was so normal, they went public.
[02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:19.811]  They were the ones that told on themselves.
[02:03:20.794 --> 02:03:21.415]  I don't know.
[02:03:39.847 --> 02:03:41.268]  So that he can get in and out of his flight.
[02:03:41.288 --> 02:03:46.010]  Because apparently, if you have a government official with you, you can get past anything.
[02:03:46.111 --> 02:03:47.191]  And who knows what somebody's doing?
[02:03:47.211 --> 02:03:51.894]  I wonder if they're going to pat down... Yeah, your friend's bringing up Muttalib, the underwear bomber.
[02:03:52.234 --> 02:03:55.516]  We had several witnesses who were on the plane from Amsterdam.
[02:03:56.256 --> 02:03:58.878]  He didn't have his passport, didn't even have his ID.
[02:03:59.398 --> 02:04:04.001]  And a well-dressed man, obviously in command, got him through the scanners without scanning.
[02:04:05.041 --> 02:04:20.730]  Got him onto the airplane and then he was protected and then it came out the State Department was ordered by a quote unnamed US agency to help get the underwear bomber on the week before all the scanners arrived.
[02:04:20.970 --> 02:04:27.934]  They ordered him a year before that and then right as they're about to arrive a government stooge is protected on the plane.
[02:04:29.005 --> 02:04:31.646]  Um, and, oh, I actually believe that that happened.
[02:04:31.826 --> 02:04:35.126]  One thing, just to corroborate some things that you bring up... Well, hold on!
[02:04:35.166 --> 02:04:36.387]  Hey, Owen, you're awesome, man.
[02:04:36.427 --> 02:04:37.627]  You need to do a regular talk show.
[02:04:37.667 --> 02:04:38.247]  I guess you do.
[02:04:38.287 --> 02:04:38.687]  Stay there.
[02:04:38.927 --> 02:04:42.368]  We're gonna come back, have you finish up, and I promise I'm getting to the calls and all the other news.
[02:04:42.968 --> 02:04:44.929]  He's the O-Doctor, Owen J.J.
[02:04:44.969 --> 02:04:45.369]  Stone.
[02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:46.149]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:46.169 --> 02:04:47.709]  We'll tell you about his website and a lot more.
[02:04:48.150 --> 02:04:53.651]  He was co-hosting This Week in Tech, and the story's up on the Drudge Report about them grabbing his genitals.
[02:04:53.671 --> 02:04:54.071]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.994 --> 02:04:59.237]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:04:59.537 --> 02:04:59.817]  Number 1.
[02:05:00.458 --> 02:05:03.600]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:04.440]  Number 2.
[02:05:04.741 --> 02:05:09.284]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:09.644 --> 02:05:10.084]  It's true.
[02:05:10.384 --> 02:05:14.947]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:15.248 --> 02:05:15.788]  Number 3.
[02:05:16.068 --> 02:05:19.370]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:19.670 --> 02:05:23.353]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:23.553 --> 02:05:24.114]  Number 4.
[02:05:24.354 --> 02:05:26.716]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:27.117 --> 02:05:30.500]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:30.801 --> 02:05:31.341]  Number 5.
[02:05:31.601 --> 02:05:35.506]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:35.746 --> 02:05:40.511]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:06:18.869 --> 02:06:25.094]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:06:46.959 --> 02:06:47.459]  Thank you!
[02:06:55.825 --> 02:06:59.446]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:59.846 --> 02:07:02.847]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:03.067 --> 02:07:07.848]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:07.868 --> 02:07:14.110]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:16.491]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:17.051 --> 02:07:17.331]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:17.351 --> 02:07:17.771]  Bernanke?
[02:07:17.871 --> 02:07:18.632]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:18.672 --> 02:07:19.792]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:19.812 --> 02:07:22.053]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:35.939 --> 02:07:42.846]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:07:43.227 --> 02:07:52.337]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:59.861 --> 02:08:04.044]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:04.705 --> 02:08:05.505]  You want answers?
[02:08:06.286 --> 02:08:07.167]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:07.527 --> 02:08:11.450]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:16.113]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.855 --> 02:08:22.058]  Well, we're updating the story that is the top link on the Drugs Report.
[02:08:22.398 --> 02:08:22.859]  Get ready.
[02:08:24.656 --> 02:08:27.058]  Now putting hands down flyers pants.
[02:08:27.098 --> 02:08:28.159]  That's what Drudge has.
[02:08:28.199 --> 02:08:30.281]  TSA now putting hands down flyers pants.
[02:08:30.982 --> 02:08:43.673]  And as bad as the clip was that we were talking about on the syndicated radio slash TV show that Owen J.J.
[02:08:43.713 --> 02:08:44.513]  Stone was on,
[02:08:45.976 --> 02:08:56.419]  He came on our show and said, well, I didn't want to go all the way with it, but they actually put their hand in my pants and patted my rear end and then put their hand down my pants and patted my testicles.
[02:08:57.210 --> 02:09:02.634]  But no one wants to talk about this, but we have to talk about this abuse to stop it.
[02:09:02.915 --> 02:09:07.018]  But we were getting into the underwear bomber, being led onto the plane, protected by the U.S.
[02:09:07.038 --> 02:09:07.458]  government.
[02:09:08.039 --> 02:09:10.761]  The FBI said that witnesses were liars for two months.
[02:09:11.401 --> 02:09:17.726]  Then, when the Undersecretary of State got in trouble, he came out and said, OK, I was ordered to do this, so don't blame me.
[02:09:18.547 --> 02:09:18.848]  U.S.
[02:09:18.888 --> 02:09:21.392]  government ordered us to help Muttalib get on the plane.
[02:09:21.813 --> 02:09:23.976]  It's the same thing every single time.
[02:09:24.016 --> 02:09:27.021]  And you were saying that you wanted to add something to that.
[02:09:27.101 --> 02:09:27.642]  Owen, go ahead.
[02:09:28.590 --> 02:09:30.753]  Last part of the show, I don't want to take up too much time on your show.
[02:09:31.273 --> 02:09:37.680]  Whenever I talk to someone that's skeptical about what the government can do and why they would do things, I say, well, what about the Tuskegee Airmen?
[02:09:38.181 --> 02:09:43.887]  Did the government not do things to their own troops and people that were putting their lives on the line for their own country?
[02:09:44.268 --> 02:09:44.848]  Yes, they did.
[02:09:45.008 --> 02:09:46.230]  And they came out and they admitted it.
[02:09:46.250 --> 02:09:47.491]  Oh, it was wrong, we shouldn't do it.
[02:09:47.792 --> 02:09:49.734]  That just puts you in a mental state of what they can do.
[02:09:50.134 --> 02:09:53.516]  Did this government come out and tell me that there are weapons of mass destruction?
[02:09:53.756 --> 02:09:57.838]  And then three or four years later say, oh, there's no weapons of mass destruction, but we still need to have the war anyway.
[02:09:58.118 --> 02:10:04.862]  I mean, there are basic lines of lies that they give you that they apologize for later, and then people pass under the bridge.
[02:10:05.242 --> 02:10:07.643]  I mean, at the bottom line, don't trust anyone.
[02:10:07.703 --> 02:10:12.286]  Question everything, because as soon as you start taking everything somebody feeds you, you're going to end up getting sick.
[02:10:12.706 --> 02:10:17.587]  Because not everything is for everyone, and I appreciate you having me on the show and bringing up this topic.
[02:10:17.868 --> 02:10:25.850]  Well, Owen, Owen, it's funny you brought that up, but I didn't want to bring it up just because there's so much to cover, but I was thinking the same thing 20 minutes ago.
[02:10:26.630 --> 02:10:30.451]  I was going to bring up the issue, and not because you're black, but because it affects us all.
[02:10:31.671 --> 02:10:39.054]  For 45 years, they shot black men up with syphilis to watch how it killed them and to have them spread it in the black community.
[02:10:39.414 --> 02:10:40.054]  Now we learn
[02:10:40.894 --> 02:10:44.216]  They were shooting Guatemalan men, women, and children up with syphilis.
[02:10:44.637 --> 02:10:54.304]  Now we learn this year that source CBS News, but they bury it in the article, the UN is going all over the world, Africa, Asia, Latin America.
[02:10:55.543 --> 02:11:00.589]  Giving children weaponized polio, telling them it's a polio vaccine.
[02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:02.791]  I mean, Project Shad.
[02:11:03.111 --> 02:11:08.618]  Tens of thousands of our troops from the 1940s right through the 1980s, declassified.
[02:11:08.878 --> 02:11:14.704]  They would nerve gas our troops in some cases, kill them, and tell their families they died of the flu.
[02:11:15.445 --> 02:11:24.575]  And they do that to create cadres, armies of doctors and scientists that will do anything crazy they're told, and that's what this TSA army's about.
[02:11:24.875 --> 02:11:31.342]  We've confirmed, from TSA insiders, that the last couple months they call them in and they say, are you for the naked body scanners?
[02:11:31.743 --> 02:11:33.124]  Are you concerned about radiation?
[02:11:33.564 --> 02:11:35.466]  Are you concerned about touching people's genitals?
[02:11:36.007 --> 02:11:36.888]  The basic point of it is that
[02:11:58.817 --> 02:12:01.259]  Anyone that would do this, there's something wrong with that person.
[02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:09.747]  Because, if I walk up to anyone, again, the whole color doesn't matter, whether you're blue or yellow, who wants someone else touching their private part?
[02:12:10.047 --> 02:12:11.068]  Especially a stranger!
[02:12:11.428 --> 02:12:17.554]  You know, it'd be different if they got my uncle down there to do it, or somebody I knew for 20 years, but hey, bring somebody else that knows, and we're gonna have them pat you down.
[02:12:17.874 --> 02:12:21.898]  Maybe I'd feel okay with it, but for a stranger, with a blue elastic glove on,
[02:12:22.458 --> 02:12:23.859]  Put their hands anywhere near me.
[02:12:24.219 --> 02:12:30.063]  Again, it's unsanitary, it's disgusting, it's evasive, and they usually want to take you in private to do it.
[02:12:30.383 --> 02:12:34.026]  And those are all kinds of signs that these people are creepy and weird.
[02:12:34.446 --> 02:12:36.848]  They sit behind a shielded screen.
[02:12:37.248 --> 02:12:38.249]  Oh, don't even talk about that.
[02:12:38.289 --> 02:12:40.570]  When they're doing the x-rays, their side is shielded.
[02:12:40.630 --> 02:12:41.791]  They've got lead protection.
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:45.023]  You know, they're sitting behind a lead wall looking at you.
[02:12:45.083 --> 02:12:46.725]  That's another good point I noticed.
[02:12:46.765 --> 02:12:51.450]  There is some type of lead wall, and when they run the system, they do get behind it.
[02:12:51.850 --> 02:12:53.992]  That's a key point I hadn't thought to talk about.
[02:12:54.012 --> 02:12:55.274]  There's so many facets.
[02:12:55.594 --> 02:12:58.798]  They're telling us it's safe, but they're hiding behind shielding.
[02:12:59.378 --> 02:13:03.542]  Again, my dentist puts a metal plate on my chest and then runs into another room to click the button.
[02:13:03.943 --> 02:13:05.565]  These guys don't even give me a metal plate.
[02:13:05.585 --> 02:13:07.607]  They just run around their wall and click the button.
[02:13:08.267 --> 02:13:08.948]  It's not safe.
[02:13:09.348 --> 02:13:12.251]  People are gonna have their hair falling out in 15 years, and it's not a joke.
[02:13:12.331 --> 02:13:13.012]  It's radiation.
[02:13:13.613 --> 02:13:14.814]  All I know is radiation's bad.
[02:13:14.874 --> 02:13:15.675]  I'm not a scientist.
[02:13:16.195 --> 02:13:17.316]  I'm not even that smart.
[02:13:17.537 --> 02:13:22.482]  But all I know is that when I go to my doctor, they put protection on me, and then they still leave the room.
[02:13:24.634 --> 02:13:27.537]  Well, we know top scientists have come out.
[02:13:28.578 --> 02:13:32.482]  The Atomic Energy Agency, they've all said these things are x-rays.
[02:13:32.783 --> 02:13:34.164]  They're very, very dangerous.
[02:13:34.865 --> 02:13:37.428]  And you've just made a lot of amazing points here.
[02:13:38.208 --> 02:13:39.470]  Anything else you want to add, Owen?
[02:13:40.302 --> 02:13:41.383]  Just thanks for having me on the show.
[02:13:41.403 --> 02:13:44.445]  I'm not here to plug myself, so if somebody finds me on the internet, say hi.
[02:13:44.465 --> 02:13:45.746]  If you don't, have a great day.
[02:13:46.026 --> 02:13:55.053]  Yeah, give us the websites again, because I guarantee you, with this up on the Drugs Report, you're going to have a bunch of newspapers and TV, probably, Good Morning America.
[02:13:55.073 --> 02:13:57.675]  I had a news organization call me while I was on the line with you.
[02:13:57.695 --> 02:13:58.395]  I had to turn them down.
[02:13:58.435 --> 02:13:59.376]  I'll call them back later.
[02:14:00.637 --> 02:14:03.499]  The onggstone.com is the easiest way to get me.
[02:14:03.579 --> 02:14:04.059]  I'm on the internet.
[02:14:04.119 --> 02:14:04.740]  People can find me.
[02:14:05.405 --> 02:14:11.094]  Alright, we'll talk to you as this unfolds and develops, but bottom line, you did feel violated?
[02:14:11.355 --> 02:14:14.099]  Did you feel molested by him patting your genitals?
[02:14:15.311 --> 02:14:16.252]  I feel violated.
[02:14:16.352 --> 02:14:23.256]  You know, if I would have felt molested, I would have punched him in the face and I'd probably be in jail right now because, again, and the only reason he did that is because he wasn't apologetic and I had it in public.
[02:14:23.476 --> 02:14:25.457]  If it would have been in private, I'd probably be in a cell or something.
[02:14:25.537 --> 02:14:36.144]  Did you hear about the TSA worker who they made fun of the size of his member every day so he punched his boss in the nose and then he got arrested?
[02:14:37.694 --> 02:14:38.735]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:14:55.185 --> 02:14:55.965]  Got me all fired up.
[02:14:56.205 --> 02:14:57.086]  Thanks for having me.
[02:15:14.170 --> 02:15:18.876]  And ladies and gentlemen, I can only add, people for three weeks, a minority of people.
[02:15:19.436 --> 02:15:23.841]  I mean, I could give you Valhalla on a silver platter and people would complain.
[02:15:24.402 --> 02:15:31.410]  But I've seen this fake meme being put out, probably by operatives, of, why is Alex spending hours every day
[02:15:32.659 --> 02:15:34.100]  Talking about the TSA.
[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:40.043]  Because if they're able to get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[02:15:40.863 --> 02:15:45.566]  If they can touch your genitals, and now, see now, three weeks ago it's pat outside.
[02:15:45.866 --> 02:15:49.127]  First it's back of the hands, then it's inside of the hands, then it's squeeze.
[02:15:49.448 --> 02:15:51.909]  Now it's, we're gonna stick our hands in your pants.
[02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:57.254]  And it's not just because I know how the TSA will operate.
[02:15:57.854 --> 02:15:59.835]  They'll come out and say Owen's not telling the truth.
[02:15:59.895 --> 02:16:00.236]  Oh, really?
[02:16:00.876 --> 02:16:04.698]  We have clips of newscasts with the news reporting it with other people.
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:09.181]  See, first it's we're just going to run our hands in your waistband.
[02:16:09.301 --> 02:16:12.944]  Oh, now I'm going to stick my hands in your pants and patch your rear end.
[02:16:13.944 --> 02:16:16.446]  I'm going to patch your... I mean, this is going on.
[02:16:18.066 --> 02:16:18.906]  This is happening!
[02:16:19.427 --> 02:16:21.188]  And I can only salute the Drudge Report.
[02:16:21.848 --> 02:16:30.492]  Nine billion page views in the first eleven and a half months, or I guess ten and a half months, because we've got a month and a half left in the year.
[02:16:30.973 --> 02:16:32.733]  It's the 16th day of November 2010.
[02:16:33.194 --> 02:16:38.136]  In ten and a half months, nine billion page views.
[02:16:38.576 --> 02:16:40.137]  Nine billion!
[02:16:41.218 --> 02:16:46.140]  We are getting millions of readers a day on top of the millions we already get from the Drudge Report.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:47.241]  We salute the Drudge Report.
[02:16:48.032 --> 02:17:01.482]  For understanding how key this issue is, it was the Drudge Report three weeks ago that began to pick up our video clips, our articles, and then other people started complaining, and other people started standing up, and other people started saying no.
[02:17:01.842 --> 02:17:07.987]  And now it's just the front page of every paper, it's, you know, we're not talking about some stupid royal wedding anymore.
[02:17:08.848 --> 02:17:10.149]  That's way down the page!
[02:17:12.691 --> 02:17:15.413]  We're now talking about real issues.
[02:17:15.493 --> 02:17:19.776]  We're now talking about the government putting its hands on your genitals.
[02:17:21.177 --> 02:17:22.558]  The government in your pants.
[02:17:24.079 --> 02:17:28.622]  And we're now understanding that this is all a giant stinking fraud.
[02:17:30.452 --> 02:17:32.013]  And we now have the update on the article.
[02:17:32.113 --> 02:17:32.513]  Update.
[02:17:32.933 --> 02:17:33.633]  Owen J.J.
[02:17:33.673 --> 02:17:43.717]  Stone appeared on the Alex Jones Show today to discuss the incident and how the TSA goon touched his parts by specifically patting his backside and testicles.
[02:17:44.397 --> 02:17:45.758]  We need to add to that, Paul.
[02:17:46.078 --> 02:17:46.858]  I said and I am to.
[02:17:46.878 --> 02:17:49.719]  We need to add, Paul, specifically inside his pants.
[02:17:49.839 --> 02:17:50.720]  That's the key.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.681]  The hand was inside the pants.
[02:17:54.501 --> 02:17:55.682]  Inside the pants.
[02:17:56.621 --> 02:18:06.445]  So when he's a read, Owen JJ Stone appeared on the Alex Jones Show today to discuss the incident and how he was embarrassed to tell the whole story previously.
[02:18:06.805 --> 02:18:14.629]  He went public with the fact that the TSA agent, while apologizing profusely, put his hand
[02:18:16.301 --> 02:18:17.822]  Inside his pants!
[02:18:18.302 --> 02:18:21.924]  And patted his genitals and gluteus maximus.
[02:18:22.164 --> 02:18:23.164]  Get me Watson online.
[02:18:23.364 --> 02:18:24.305]  He's probably already listening.
[02:18:24.345 --> 02:18:26.185]  Just get me on, get him online, please.
[02:18:26.726 --> 02:18:29.287]  As I go to break here in a moment, I want to specifically give him the update.
[02:18:29.527 --> 02:18:31.628]  So it's specifically what is there.
[02:18:31.668 --> 02:18:35.189]  This is a big update to this national story.
[02:18:36.370 --> 02:18:37.410]  That Owen J.J.
[02:18:37.450 --> 02:18:42.032]  Stone, you notice he was kind of hesitant the first time he told it.
[02:18:42.052 --> 02:18:45.294]  He was like, and then he kind of put his hand on my pants and he touched my profits.
[02:18:46.147 --> 02:18:47.068]  Oh, I pressed him on it.
[02:18:47.088 --> 02:18:48.088]  I said, what did he do specifically?
[02:18:48.609 --> 02:18:59.957]  Put his hand all the way around his thighs, on his buttocks, on the buttocks, in between the sweatpants and the underwear, so he didn't do it under the underwear, on top of the underwear, and patted him.
[02:19:00.838 --> 02:19:05.261]  Then he went to the front, the front of his underwear, and patted his testicles.
[02:19:05.601 --> 02:19:07.202]  And I'm sorry to have to get into this on air.
[02:19:07.463 --> 02:19:09.344]  This is what the government's going to do to everybody.
[02:19:09.704 --> 02:19:11.506]  Talking about it is good to expose it.
[02:19:11.706 --> 02:19:13.187]  What's bad is that they're doing it.
[02:19:16.055 --> 02:19:16.915]  Go ahead and dial Watson.
[02:19:16.956 --> 02:19:19.017]  I want to talk to him during the breaks to get this update done.
[02:19:19.757 --> 02:19:20.117]  Thank you.
[02:19:21.578 --> 02:19:22.779]  Now we're going to come back from break.
[02:19:22.819 --> 02:19:24.860]  I know the callers are going to be all over the map and that's fine.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:28.602]  We're going to go to Frank, Sean, Mike, James, Emmanuel and others.
[02:19:28.622 --> 02:19:28.902]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:19:29.022 --> 02:19:32.724]  We got a bunch of economic news.
[02:19:32.764 --> 02:19:33.705]  It's just more of the same.
[02:19:34.205 --> 02:19:39.388]  The bankers that have engineered the world collapse trying to get even more power and control out of what they've engineered.
[02:19:40.836 --> 02:19:42.458]  A lot of people are fighting it worldwide.
[02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:45.222]  The economic numbers continue to come in.
[02:19:45.462 --> 02:19:46.463]  Stock market plunging.
[02:19:47.384 --> 02:19:52.210]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, as we cover life inside the New World Order.
[02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:57.441]  Are the threats of a biological attack to the U.S.
[02:19:57.521 --> 02:19:57.822]  real?
[02:19:57.982 --> 02:20:02.745]  If biological warfare is real, what should I know before it happens to protect my family?
[02:20:02.945 --> 02:20:11.310]  The answers to the unthinkable are inside a new book by Christian patriot and author Sam Adams, Pale Horse, How to Survive a Chemical or Biological Attack.
[02:20:11.650 --> 02:20:30.506]  Inside what's been called the must-have manual for surviving the attack and mass panic that will follow, you will learn what the actual biological and chemical threats are, how to respond to events that are almost certain to happen, what the government's response is likely to be, how some will take advantage of the chaos, and exactly how you should prepare to get pale-horsed.
[02:20:30.646 --> 02:20:32.367]  This is not your father's Biowar Survival Handbook.
[02:20:55.242 --> 02:20:59.383]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:20:59.443 --> 02:21:00.704]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:21:00.864 --> 02:21:04.565]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:21:04.865 --> 02:21:07.385]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[02:21:07.586 --> 02:21:09.406]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:21:09.566 --> 02:21:12.667]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:21:12.907 --> 02:21:15.228]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now,
[02:21:20.049 --> 02:21:21.650]  Your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:25.113]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:21:25.173 --> 02:21:28.295]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:21:28.495 --> 02:21:30.316]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:21:30.416 --> 02:21:34.239]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[02:21:34.259 --> 02:21:35.019]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:21:35.059 --> 02:21:37.521]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:21:47.748 --> 02:21:49.489]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:21:50.209 --> 02:21:58.171]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:21:58.972 --> 02:21:59.892]  Tyranny is here.
[02:22:00.252 --> 02:22:03.893]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:22:03.933 --> 02:22:06.394]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:06.414 --> 02:22:11.836]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:12.256 --> 02:22:18.539]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:18.939 --> 02:22:24.481]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:24.921 --> 02:22:28.583]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:22:29.103 --> 02:22:33.065]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:22:33.365 --> 02:22:38.928]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:39.329 --> 02:22:42.310]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:44.291]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:44.852 --> 02:22:45.352]  It's here.

[02:22:54.073 --> 02:22:55.074]  Who is Sam Andy?

[02:22:57.915 --> 02:22:59.376]  Life insurance you can eat.

[02:23:04.078 --> 02:23:04.799]  Why so long?
[02:23:05.139 --> 02:23:05.499]  Simple.
[02:23:05.679 --> 02:23:09.341]  Sam Andy Foods have perfected the taste and quality of low-moisture foods.
[02:23:09.501 --> 02:23:11.962]  Foods that last 15 to 25 years.
[02:23:12.142 --> 02:23:16.905]  And that's made us an industry leader among families, sportsmen, outdoorsmen, churches, schools,
[02:23:17.045 --> 02:23:18.825]  People living in remote areas, U.S.
[02:23:18.885 --> 02:23:20.766]  troops in wartime, and many others.
[02:23:21.026 --> 02:23:28.828]  Sam Andy is America's leading supplier of over 100 high-quality, low-moisture products and everything you need to survive in any emergency.

[02:23:40.691 --> 02:23:41.271]  More and more,
[02:24:01.425 --> 02:24:07.249]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the alternative media is driving the news.
[02:24:09.010 --> 02:24:17.655]  Yesterday morning we found a online YouTube clip of a three-year-old screaming and crying with the enhanced pat-down.
[02:24:18.936 --> 02:24:24.820]  We wrote a story about it and today the San Francisco Chronicle has it, TSA pat-downs a screaming toddler.
[02:24:27.728 --> 02:24:30.149]  So it just shows how more and more we're driving the news.
[02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:32.351]  And again, top link on Drudge.
[02:24:32.371 --> 02:24:33.211]  Here's some of the other news.
[02:24:33.632 --> 02:24:35.893]  Stocks extend losses amid China.
[02:24:36.033 --> 02:24:36.633]  EU worries.
[02:24:36.693 --> 02:24:37.194]  Sell-off.
[02:24:37.514 --> 02:24:40.375]  Bond market defies Fed.
[02:24:40.456 --> 02:24:43.137]  Weaker dollar seen as unlikely to cure joblessness.
[02:24:44.438 --> 02:24:46.599]  Yeah, because there are no industries there.
[02:24:47.099 --> 02:24:54.304]  Even if the dollar goes down and that encourages manufacturing, you can't compete with the Chinese because they're already at rock bottom.
[02:24:55.216 --> 02:24:55.916]  They're already.
[02:24:56.217 --> 02:24:58.157]  It's the giant sucking sound to the bottom.
[02:24:58.418 --> 02:24:59.398]  It's the race to the bottom.
[02:24:59.858 --> 02:25:07.922]  Let's go to Frank, Sean, Mike, James, Emmanuel, and a few others, and I will get to the economic news and some other key info, but let's go to Frank right now in Texas.
[02:25:07.962 --> 02:25:08.703]  Frank, you're on the air.
[02:25:09.443 --> 02:25:10.564]  Hey Alex, I called last week.
[02:25:11.264 --> 02:25:37.542]  Mentioned to you that a TSA had kind of like racked me in the in the crotch area and I was back for another trip this past weekend and he did the pat-down the guy who did the pat-down was actually You could tell he felt bad and he was loving he was more but a bit Yeah, but they admit this pressure thing like they just early make sure that in the bomb The guy had the problem was with the guy with the guy the TSA guy checking my ticket and I had a driver's license that expired just by two days, but I had my passport with me and
[02:25:38.044 --> 02:25:38.184]  No, see?
[02:25:53.144 --> 02:25:54.784]  See, he wants to boss you around.
[02:25:54.844 --> 02:25:56.505]  It has nothing to do with stopping terrorists.
[02:25:56.765 --> 02:25:58.785]  His boss has launched the attack, and he knows it.
[02:25:59.085 --> 02:26:02.966]  It's about letting you know, slave, you belong to the government.
[02:26:03.266 --> 02:26:11.027]  We're going to be sucking a lot more off of you, and we're here to train you that we are the master, so it's any excuse to get in your business.
[02:26:11.287 --> 02:26:20.389]  He's some powerless person who couldn't get a job cleaning porta-potties, but now he gets to tell, so he finds one little thing, he gets to let you know.
[02:26:21.209 --> 02:26:21.749]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:21.789 --> 02:26:23.770]  And I had okayed it with them the week before.
[02:26:23.810 --> 02:26:29.031]  They said, yeah, you know, as long as you're not a criminal, we'll let the expiration be one year over the date and you're okay.
[02:26:29.291 --> 02:26:33.372]  But to my surprise, when I told them I would renew it or I would drive if I felt like it.
[02:26:33.392 --> 02:26:34.752]  But you didn't even need the driver's license.
[02:26:34.772 --> 02:26:36.053]  You could have just had the passport.
[02:26:36.313 --> 02:26:38.994]  But when I told them that, I thought he'd blow up and he got red in the face.
[02:26:39.034 --> 02:26:39.794]  But guess what, Alex?
[02:26:39.914 --> 02:26:41.694]  He didn't come back with a single sound.
[02:26:41.794 --> 02:26:43.135]  What did you say to this God?
[02:26:43.195 --> 02:26:44.295]  What did you say to this ruler?
[02:26:45.469 --> 02:26:48.411]  You tell me, aren't you going to drive this weekend in Dallas?
[02:26:48.472 --> 02:26:50.393]  And I said, if I feel like it, I will.
[02:26:50.413 --> 02:26:52.534]  If I don't feel like it, I won't.
[02:26:52.935 --> 02:26:55.677]  And I expected to be escorted, but he didn't say a word.
[02:26:55.757 --> 02:26:58.859]  And the Border Patrol guys next to him started laughing because we're on the border.
[02:26:59.546 --> 02:27:04.790]  And, uh, I just, you know, walked through, got a real decent pat down, and I was glad I finally told that guy to shut up.
[02:27:05.010 --> 02:27:06.811]  And, uh, you know, I was just surprised.
[02:27:06.831 --> 02:27:07.512]  I was like, what do they say?
[02:27:07.532 --> 02:27:08.993]  You know, a barking dog never bites.
[02:27:09.033 --> 02:27:10.314]  And I think that was the case right here.
[02:27:10.614 --> 02:27:14.897]  Well, look, they're, again, they've been told, brutalize these people, drive them into submission.
[02:27:15.257 --> 02:27:17.679]  The globalists are getting ready to take the Social Security.
[02:27:18.119 --> 02:27:20.501]  They're getting ready to take large portions of the bank accounts.
[02:27:20.841 --> 02:27:22.803]  They're getting ready to really slap us around.
[02:27:22.823 --> 02:27:27.826]  And they've created this culture of worshipping the police state, worshipping our oppressors.
[02:27:28.166 --> 02:27:28.587]  It's over.
[02:27:29.207 --> 02:27:31.068]  And it starts with this TSA issue.
[02:27:31.108 --> 02:27:33.149]  I'm telling you, folks, this is big.
[02:27:33.409 --> 02:27:36.950]  This is only the beginning as people stand up and say no to tyranny.
[02:27:37.271 --> 02:27:38.651]  Let's talk to Sean in Georgia.
[02:27:38.691 --> 02:27:39.552]  Sean, you're on the air.
[02:27:39.572 --> 02:27:42.293]  Hello, Alex.
[02:27:42.693 --> 02:27:43.994]  Hello, evil Al-Qaeda.
[02:27:45.194 --> 02:27:46.355]  Alex, how you doing, sir?
[02:27:46.595 --> 02:27:47.155]  Good, go ahead.
[02:27:48.155 --> 02:27:49.776]  Hey, this is Sean in Georgia.
[02:27:50.316 --> 02:27:51.537]  I just wanted to follow up with you.
[02:27:51.557 --> 02:27:58.520]  Hearing about these body scanners and intrusiveness, it's a little disturbing.
[02:27:59.346 --> 02:28:00.447]  But I made a couple of notes.
[02:28:01.987 --> 02:28:10.552]  You know, normally if somebody's at the evening where it's PJ's, but I think that you should market InfoWars to JP's Junk Protection.
[02:28:11.432 --> 02:28:19.736]  InfoWars.com, so when somebody goes to the body scanner, they can see just like the guy had the lead for anything else, the person's protected.
[02:28:21.797 --> 02:28:24.178]  You should come up with a contest, you know, much like an auto dealer.
[02:28:26.321 --> 02:28:29.424]  Well, they're being sued, but I mean, I don't have a million dollars, so...
[02:28:52.907 --> 02:28:53.527]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:29:13.378 --> 02:29:16.022]  More people are informed about... No, Sean, that's a great idea.
[02:29:16.042 --> 02:29:17.824]  Why don't you write that up and send it to us?
[02:29:18.405 --> 02:29:19.747]  You know, that reminds me.
[02:29:20.087 --> 02:29:25.295]  We did our naked body scanner protest contest, what, seven, eight, nine months ago?
[02:29:26.837 --> 02:29:27.698]  It was early this year.
[02:29:28.957 --> 02:29:31.098]  And people are like, well, this isn't going to do anything.
[02:29:31.498 --> 02:29:34.919]  Yes, it raises awareness to the next plateau.
[02:29:34.939 --> 02:29:39.980]  Then the next plateau, it takes time to discredit and defeat the globalists.
[02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:41.960]  Resistance is victory.
[02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:44.861]  The act of resistance and perseverance.
[02:29:45.421 --> 02:29:46.341]  We're on the march.
[02:29:46.822 --> 02:29:48.422]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:49.342 --> 02:29:52.043]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.350 --> 02:29:58.652]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:29:58.912 --> 02:29:59.993]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:30:00.053 --> 02:30:04.415]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:30:04.615 --> 02:30:10.258]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:30:10.558 --> 02:30:12.540]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:15.441]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:30:15.741 --> 02:30:22.045]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:30:22.245 --> 02:30:24.026]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:30:24.446 --> 02:30:29.509]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:30:29.769 --> 02:30:34.771]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[02:30:35.071 --> 02:30:40.274]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:30:40.434 --> 02:30:43.396]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:30:43.636 --> 02:30:46.577]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:46.637 --> 02:30:47.398]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:30:58.829 --> 02:30:59.750]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:00.090 --> 02:31:03.673]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:03.953 --> 02:31:06.275]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:06.415 --> 02:31:11.719]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:12.119 --> 02:31:18.364]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:18.784 --> 02:31:24.326]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:24.767 --> 02:31:28.448]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:28.928 --> 02:31:32.950]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:38.752]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:39.172 --> 02:31:42.134]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:42.734 --> 02:31:44.134]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:45.135]  It's here.

[02:31:58.739 --> 02:32:04.762]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:05.142 --> 02:32:12.225]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:12.525 --> 02:32:17.107]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:32:26.061 --> 02:32:29.787]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:36.490]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:40.492]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:40.972 --> 02:32:47.236]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:47.336 --> 02:32:48.136]  Thank you.
[02:33:01.607 --> 02:33:06.092]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:33:06.212 --> 02:33:06.753]  Yeah!
[02:33:07.193 --> 02:33:08.675]  In the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:08.695 --> 02:33:09.997]  In the heart of the resistance!
[02:33:10.357 --> 02:33:12.519]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:33:16.704 --> 02:33:19.367]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.929 --> 02:33:31.872]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[02:33:33.953 --> 02:33:35.734]  The resistance is on.
[02:33:37.935 --> 02:33:38.935]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:39.616 --> 02:33:52.423]  All right, I want to continue with your phone calls and get into the economic news and some of the other really hardcore information, but we've done two hours and 33 minutes here and I do want to tell you about wonderful sponsors who I really believe in and who also make this transmission possible.
[02:33:53.363 --> 02:33:55.365]  One of them, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:33:56.146 --> 02:34:00.030]  That's the letter E, foodsdirect.com, banners up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:34:00.671 --> 02:34:03.654]  This is insurance you can eat, store safely for more than 10 years.
[02:34:04.074 --> 02:34:05.255]  Only the best ingredients.
[02:34:05.295 --> 02:34:06.196]  This is the real deal.
[02:34:06.757 --> 02:34:07.758]  30 plus years in business.
[02:34:08.118 --> 02:34:10.301]  They're patriots and have supported the movement for years.
[02:34:10.761 --> 02:34:12.143]  Independence, not dependency.
[02:34:12.163 --> 02:34:14.705]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:34:15.586 --> 02:34:18.189]  We've got grab-and-go packs, great for camping outdoors.
[02:34:18.649 --> 02:34:21.112]  It's easy to just grab, toss in the car with a family.

[02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:41.911]  They grab water out of the atmosphere.
[02:34:41.931 --> 02:34:44.814]  It's like an R2-D2 high-tech water cooler without the water bottle.
[02:34:45.354 --> 02:34:48.597]  They're smaller units, do 7.5 gallons a day, send it through 7 filters.
[02:34:49.077 --> 02:34:51.899]  They have medium-sized units that do more and send it through 12 filters.
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:55.082]  And then they've got big units that can supply a whole army if you want.
[02:34:55.542 --> 02:34:56.763]  acolablue.com.
[02:34:56.863 --> 02:34:59.105]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.

[02:35:16.900 --> 02:35:25.006]  The folks at Food Production Systems have put together an amazing DVD resource that shows you how to build a food production machine out of a small space in an urban environment.
[02:35:25.307 --> 02:35:26.287]  Everything you need to know from

[02:36:10.766 --> 02:36:14.388]  Okay, I've got to hurry down through your calls, because I want to get into... Report!
[02:36:14.708 --> 02:36:18.209]  Foreclosure mess could threaten banks, Associated Press.
[02:36:18.770 --> 02:36:23.632]  We told you that ten years ago, and last month, but now here it is, mainstream news.
[02:36:24.052 --> 02:36:29.134]  And of course, there's been a threat, so they'll need more of our money, and the threat just gets bigger.
[02:36:29.614 --> 02:36:32.576]  It's like Greece, and Spain, and Portugal, and Ireland.
[02:36:33.616 --> 02:36:36.577]  Oh, we've got to have this bailout or we'll go belly up a few months later.
[02:36:36.597 --> 02:36:38.737]  We've got to have a bailout or we'll go belly up.
[02:36:39.017 --> 02:36:40.217]  And the bankers just love it.
[02:36:40.577 --> 02:36:45.198]  Because it's taxpayer money bailing it out, but it isn't bailing it out.
[02:36:45.418 --> 02:36:48.919]  It's mathematically impossible to pay it back through the fractional reserve system.
[02:36:49.879 --> 02:36:50.799]  It's a takeover.
[02:36:50.879 --> 02:36:51.859]  It's designed.
[02:36:52.599 --> 02:36:56.980]  It's like some poor guy, you know, at the roulette table who's lost a million dollars.
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:36:59.880]  He's in hock for another million and he just thinks he's going to get out of the hole.
[02:37:00.181 --> 02:37:00.641]  You're not.
[02:37:01.161 --> 02:37:02.181]  The House is going to win.
[02:37:03.257 --> 02:37:04.658]  Let's go to Mike in Wyoming.
[02:37:04.698 --> 02:37:05.419]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:37:05.439 --> 02:37:06.880]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:37:07.060 --> 02:37:07.441]  Pretty good.
[02:37:09.522 --> 02:37:12.945]  I'm wondering where the, as a Christian, I'm wondering where the Christian outcry's at.
[02:37:13.306 --> 02:37:15.908]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:37:16.148 --> 02:37:25.636]  I mean, we've got preachers that say... Well, the new Christian religion is obsessing and getting scared of Muslims and talking about them all day and hating them.
[02:37:26.277 --> 02:37:29.059]  And, you know, let's just hypothetically say Muslims are the devil.
[02:37:29.099 --> 02:37:30.880]  I don't believe that, but let's just say they're pure evil.
[02:37:31.937 --> 02:37:32.457]  Out to get us.
[02:37:32.977 --> 02:37:38.259]  Why is 95% of Homeland Security aimed at gun owners, Christians, conservatives, returning veterans?
[02:37:38.599 --> 02:37:40.280]  This isn't for the Muslims.
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:43.861]  This is for the American people and property owners.
[02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:47.902]  And, of course, they worship tyranny.
[02:37:48.462 --> 02:37:51.443]  I've seen Pat Robertson say, take a chip, it's of the Lord.
[02:37:51.523 --> 02:37:52.944]  Biometrics, it's of the Lord.
[02:37:53.844 --> 02:37:58.767]  It's all of the Lord to have your wife and children fondled, because these aren't Christian churches.
[02:37:58.787 --> 02:38:06.252]  These are 501c3 government whorehouses who are there, by and large, to submit to this tyranny.
[02:38:06.272 --> 02:38:07.253]  That's a great point, Mike.
[02:38:07.273 --> 02:38:07.693]  Finish up.
[02:38:07.713 --> 02:38:07.833]  Yeah.
[02:38:08.073 --> 02:38:10.235]  Where are the churches talking about this?
[02:38:10.575 --> 02:38:19.781]  They're telling people, Romans 13, how Hitler, that was his favorite Bible verse, do what government tells you, when that's not what Romans 13 actually says.
[02:38:19.801 --> 02:38:20.121]  Go ahead.
[02:38:20.759 --> 02:38:22.080]  Well, we've got a rogue government.
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:26.462]  I mean, we lost our government when they threw out the Constitution.
[02:38:26.542 --> 02:38:27.422]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:38:28.062 --> 02:38:33.005]  Ninety-six percent in a Reuters poll said they're not going to fly and they want the machines removed.
[02:38:33.465 --> 02:38:36.406]  Now, this is a government for and by the people.
[02:38:36.807 --> 02:38:39.328]  So, render unto Caesar, we are the government.
[02:38:42.425 --> 02:38:44.707]  But see, we're not Caesar in this country.
[02:38:44.947 --> 02:38:51.172]  A bunch of corrupt, devilish banks are, and the average Christian church just can't lick enough boots.
[02:38:51.212 --> 02:38:51.792]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:52.493 --> 02:38:55.215]  Well, you know, we sat down for abortion.
[02:38:55.255 --> 02:38:57.356]  I mean, we got 50 million abortions.
[02:38:57.396 --> 02:38:58.517]  They think it's of the Lord.
[02:38:58.537 --> 02:39:00.499]  They think killing babies is good, man.
[02:39:01.179 --> 02:39:09.885]  We sat down for homosexuality, and now we've got that running rampant, and now we sat down for pornography, and now we've got it in the airports.
[02:39:11.223 --> 02:39:12.743]  Well, it's an act of submission.
[02:39:12.783 --> 02:39:18.324]  If they can get away with this, the sky... Look, I've got the federal documents where they're going to take blood to get a driver's license.
[02:39:18.684 --> 02:39:22.965]  That's why they've got grants to have cops take blood without warrants for DWI.
[02:39:23.005 --> 02:39:25.845]  That's just to train medical cadres of police.
[02:39:27.046 --> 02:39:28.986]  Well, I'm just a little confused.
[02:39:29.046 --> 02:39:40.528]  I mean, I... I... I... My son got in some trouble and he broke into a place and he took some girl's underwear and he got six years in jail for that and... and... and, uh...
[02:39:41.664 --> 02:39:46.446]  I went to a church and I tried to explain it to the preacher, and he said, I'm going to be watching your son.
[02:39:46.786 --> 02:39:51.688]  Any stepping out of line, we're going to be coming down on him.
[02:39:51.808 --> 02:39:53.549]  I mean, what is this?
[02:39:53.569 --> 02:39:54.889]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[02:39:54.989 --> 02:39:56.690]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call, Mike.
[02:39:57.050 --> 02:40:05.693]  The way this works is, if somebody's 18 and their girlfriend's 17, he's going to spend five years in jail for statutory rape.
[02:40:08.303 --> 02:40:12.127]  But if a jail guard rapes somebody, he's not going to get in trouble.
[02:40:12.708 --> 02:40:17.473]  Or the bad guys overseas, they torture, but when our government tortures, it's good.
[02:40:18.634 --> 02:40:22.879]  Or when the TSA sticks their hands in your pants, it's good.
[02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:26.683]  But if you stick your hands in their pants, they're going to probably kill you.
[02:40:27.788 --> 02:40:31.830]  So, again, we've been trained to just put up with government corruption.
[02:40:32.190 --> 02:40:34.351]  That all the banks steal money, that's what they do.
[02:40:34.471 --> 02:40:36.292]  All the politicians lie, that's what they do.
[02:40:36.872 --> 02:40:40.733]  And so we put up with more, more, more, more, until there's that breaking point.
[02:40:41.274 --> 02:40:47.576]  The system has counted on us just blindly going along, but now it's gotten so wild that people are waking up.
[02:40:48.017 --> 02:40:50.978]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[02:40:52.045 --> 02:40:58.569]  The level of tyranny you will live under, the level of government tyranny you will live under, is exactly the amount you put up with.
[02:40:59.890 --> 02:41:02.812]  And he went on to describe that it's unscalable.
[02:41:03.172 --> 02:41:04.053]  It's maximum.
[02:41:05.233 --> 02:41:15.160]  Even if you don't have really evil tyrants in power right now, which we do, but hypothetically we didn't, you build the systems for abuse, the criminals will get in and use it for abuse.
[02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:19.743]  You build something that can be abused, it will be abused.
[02:41:22.475 --> 02:41:31.079]  And since 1947, we've had total national security secrecy and trillions of dollars disappear into a black hole.
[02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:34.841]  Of course the government ships in the narcotics.
[02:41:35.342 --> 02:41:40.744]  Of course the government's been caught running giant child kidnapping rings in congressional hearings and no one gets in trouble.
[02:41:42.185 --> 02:41:49.269]  It's so absurdist, it's so bizarre, it's so off the charts that they can ask Rumsfeld four years ago,
[02:41:50.430 --> 02:41:55.914]  Why is DynCorp allowed to operate government contracts when it's been caught kidnapping children by the hundreds of thousands?
[02:41:56.495 --> 02:42:01.819]  And Rumsfeld said, well, I believe they went in a penalty box and were given a fine for that.
[02:42:06.222 --> 02:42:13.388]  So see, JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs gets a $500 million fine on stealing hundreds of billions.
[02:42:14.569 --> 02:42:18.251]  Just in bonuses alone they got $14 billion for their execs.
[02:42:19.132 --> 02:42:19.512]  Let me see.
[02:42:20.952 --> 02:42:23.594]  13 billion in bonuses, 500 million out of that.
[02:42:25.256 --> 02:42:26.597]  They just write it off as a loss.
[02:42:29.719 --> 02:42:31.300]  I mean, it's like what I talked about Sunday.
[02:42:33.882 --> 02:42:35.604]  I noticed it was on the front page of YouTube today.
[02:42:36.304 --> 02:42:37.665]  I'm glad folks know it's important.
[02:42:38.946 --> 02:42:49.815]  They announce all over our news, oh my gosh, we found uranium and radium isotopes in every major Texas water supply.
[02:42:51.112 --> 02:42:56.995]  And we don't know why it's there, but the story was, but the state and the feds covered it up for twenty years.
[02:42:57.915 --> 02:42:58.956]  CBS News broke it.
[02:43:00.357 --> 02:43:02.478]  And in five minutes I went and pulled up the data.
[02:43:02.498 --> 02:43:03.238]  I already knew it.
[02:43:04.158 --> 02:43:10.541]  They mine this stuff out of limestone phosphate, the same place they mine uranium and other isotopes.
[02:43:11.202 --> 02:43:12.582]  It's in the fluoride.
[02:43:13.423 --> 02:43:15.244]  It isn't just fluoride they put in your water.
[02:43:15.284 --> 02:43:16.524]  It's hundreds of chemicals.
[02:43:16.564 --> 02:43:19.206]  It's the toxic waste left over from
[02:43:20.413 --> 02:43:21.454]  Phosphate mining.
[02:43:23.415 --> 02:43:28.759]  Before that broke last Friday, three days before, I had Dr. Conant.
[02:43:28.779 --> 02:43:29.580]  In fact, here it is.
[02:43:33.663 --> 02:43:37.546]  I had Dr. Conant with the case against fluoride.
[02:43:37.846 --> 02:43:39.567]  He wrote it with James Beck, M.D.
[02:43:39.607 --> 02:43:40.007]  as well.
[02:43:42.289 --> 02:43:43.090]  And I already knew this.
[02:43:46.445 --> 02:43:48.526]  But I didn't take it like it was serious.
[02:43:49.027 --> 02:43:51.108]  You just get conditioned to accept this stuff.
[02:43:53.850 --> 02:43:57.232]  And it goes on to talk about the U.S.
[02:43:57.272 --> 02:44:01.996]  Environmental Protection Agency required mandatory reclamation of industry waste products.
[02:44:02.676 --> 02:44:11.682]  For example, Florida's typical phosphate rock, which is mined to produce the phosphate used in the fertilizer industry, contains naturally occurring uranium-238 and radium-226.
[02:44:16.035 --> 02:44:18.656]  The latter of which gives birth to deadly radon gas.
[02:44:19.697 --> 02:44:20.437]  And it goes on.
[02:44:20.837 --> 02:44:30.042]  Where does Austin, Texas get the fluoride that we pay a million plus dollars a year for to be put in our water?
[02:44:30.682 --> 02:44:34.784]  See, they'd have to pay to put that in a toxic waste dump, but instead we pay to drink it.
[02:44:35.485 --> 02:44:36.505]  It comes out of Florida.
[02:44:37.205 --> 02:44:44.049]  It comes out of famous mining areas where they did most of the mining for the original atomic bomb.
[02:44:50.241 --> 02:44:55.169]  Now, you can sit there with a yuppie news reporter and explain all that to them and they just don't connect.
[02:44:55.189 --> 02:44:59.916]  They're like, do you understand they're not just putting fluoride in the water?
[02:45:00.978 --> 02:45:02.200]  And you look at them straight in the eyes.
[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:02.821]  I've done this before.
[02:45:03.621 --> 02:45:03.701]  No.
[02:45:19.775 --> 02:45:23.876]  That the toxic waste that they can't put in fertilizer, they put in our water.
[02:45:23.916 --> 02:45:25.037]  Do you read me?
[02:45:25.397 --> 02:45:26.737]  And they'll just change the subject.
[02:45:26.797 --> 02:45:29.118]  They cannot get serious.
[02:45:29.638 --> 02:45:35.500]  Do you understand that your children in almost every city where we're fluoridated are drinking uranium?
[02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:38.761]  And their answer is just to come out and say,
[02:45:40.472 --> 02:45:42.153]  You know, mercury's good for children.
[02:45:42.733 --> 02:45:45.074]  Remember Jesse Ventura's TV show last Friday?
[02:45:45.615 --> 02:45:47.476]  Where he's talking to the congressman about the FEMA camps?
[02:45:48.376 --> 02:45:50.317]  He goes, well, they're happy children in the FEMA camps.
[02:45:52.618 --> 02:45:53.839]  Alright, I said I'd take your calls.
[02:45:53.899 --> 02:45:55.100]  It's just all so insane.
[02:45:57.141 --> 02:45:58.702]  James in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:45:58.742 --> 02:45:59.102]  Go ahead.
[02:45:59.730 --> 02:46:00.671]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:46:00.771 --> 02:46:01.632]  Good, gotta move quick.
[02:46:01.652 --> 02:46:02.193]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:46:02.213 --> 02:46:15.067]  Okay, uh, what I want to bring into light that I haven't heard anybody say, uh, what if this is one of the tactics that the government's doing to, uh, control the population because it affects the private area?
[02:46:15.087 --> 02:46:21.534]  Um, this could be one of their tactics to control the population because it affects your, you know, your sperm.
[02:46:25.538 --> 02:46:26.179]  Say that again.
[02:46:26.199 --> 02:46:27.600]  I mean, explain to me what you're saying.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.604]  Well, like when you're going for an x-ray, they put up, they block your private areas.
[02:46:34.025 --> 02:46:36.067]  But when you go through that machine, it's wide open.
[02:46:36.588 --> 02:46:36.848]  Yes.
[02:46:38.569 --> 02:46:44.374]  And wouldn't that affect, you know, for you having a kid, if you get, you know, radiated so much?
[02:46:44.555 --> 02:46:45.195]  Absolutely.
[02:46:45.255 --> 02:46:46.016]  It's eugenics.
[02:46:47.597 --> 02:46:47.817]  Right.
[02:46:48.478 --> 02:46:49.159]  Very well said.
[02:46:50.307 --> 02:47:01.252]  And another thing I'd like to say to Alex real quick is, there's, in Mount Clemens, Michigan, there was a CEO banker that died, and I believe it was all covered up, uh, through the system.
[02:47:01.272 --> 02:47:19.740]  Uh, but the examiner that did the exam didn't find a bullet hole in his head, he had a bullet in his lung, and the family took it upon theirself to hire another examiner, and he found a bullet in the back of his head, and a bullet in his lung, but yet,
[02:47:20.849 --> 02:47:23.430]  The other examiner was like, oh, sorry.
[02:47:23.790 --> 02:47:26.672]  And he said that he committed suicide.
[02:47:26.792 --> 02:47:30.453]  Yeah, the government lies even when the truth would serve them better.
[02:47:30.874 --> 02:47:37.156]  By the way, on Alexa.com, they show the hottest website in the world today.
[02:47:37.637 --> 02:47:43.339]  The hottest news story in the world is TSA now putting hands down flyers' pants.
[02:47:44.179 --> 02:47:49.922]  Drudge Report has made InfoWars.com story number one on the internet.
[02:47:51.636 --> 02:47:53.958]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:58.402]  Absolutely amazing to have that happening.
[02:47:58.703 --> 02:48:00.364]  I got a big line of people outside the door.
[02:48:00.444 --> 02:48:01.145]  Aaron, what's going on?
[02:48:06.518 --> 02:48:09.159]  Yeah, I'm glad.
[02:48:09.179 --> 02:48:11.660]  That's why I love my office and I encourage it.
[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:14.201]  They had just told me and they came running and told me the same thing.
[02:48:14.981 --> 02:48:16.442]  And you know, this is so valuable.
[02:48:17.082 --> 02:48:19.483]  This is not Lindsay Lohan being the top story.
[02:48:19.523 --> 02:48:26.266]  This is not Prince William or Twitley or whatever his name is being, you know, being coronated with his new bimbo girlfriend.
[02:48:27.386 --> 02:48:30.627]  This is, this is a substantive issue.
[02:48:30.647 --> 02:48:31.628]  This is so exciting.
[02:48:32.705 --> 02:48:34.387]  This is very exciting, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:35.368 --> 02:48:39.673]  And it's all because of our hard work getting the info out, you spreading the word about the show, and the Drudge Report.
[02:48:40.313 --> 02:48:42.236]  Let's talk to Emmanuel in Minnesota.
[02:48:42.276 --> 02:48:43.257]  Thanks for holding, Emmanuel.
[02:48:43.277 --> 02:48:45.639]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:46.500]  Good, I'm doing good.
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:47.081]  What's on your mind?
[02:48:48.603 --> 02:48:51.766]  I just wanted to say thank you for all the work that you do.
[02:48:51.806 --> 02:48:52.908]  It's greatly appreciated.
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:49:03.043]  You know, I tell my friends and family that, you know, they have to wake up and smell the coffee, you know, that the government doesn't care about them, and they look at me as if I'm crazy, you know?
[02:49:03.504 --> 02:49:06.145]  I'm African-American, and I voted for Ron Paul.
[02:49:06.225 --> 02:49:06.485]  Why?
[02:49:06.545 --> 02:49:11.627]  Because he was pushing towards the agenda, the agenda that, you know, needs to be looked at.
[02:49:11.987 --> 02:49:22.451]  But, of course, they looked at me as if I was crazy when they were looking at the current president and voting for him simply because they look like him.
[02:49:22.531 --> 02:49:23.212]  Who's the idiot?
[02:49:23.432 --> 02:49:24.032]  But, anyway,
[02:49:24.947 --> 02:49:33.290]  Um, what I wanted to get at is, uh, you know, I was listening to your show and you were talking about what's going on at the airports.
[02:49:33.650 --> 02:49:43.373]  Uh, a best friend of mine, he had an expired ID and, uh, he came from, uh, he's from LA and he came out here to, uh, Minneapolis.
[02:49:44.294 --> 02:49:54.357]  And before he got, before he got to Minneapolis, they brought him into a room, you know, they stripped him and threatened him.
[02:49:54.931 --> 02:49:55.954]  And he told me this.
[02:49:56.014 --> 02:49:57.238]  I'm like, well, wait a minute.
[02:49:58.061 --> 02:49:59.887]  Is this really happened to you?
[02:50:02.433 --> 02:50:03.394]  Yeah, let me explain.
[02:50:03.794 --> 02:50:05.015]  That's confirmed as well.
[02:50:05.415 --> 02:50:22.488]  If they can find any excuse, because don't just think everybody now gets their genitals grabbed, now they take you behind closed doors and strip you down to your underwear, even naked, and they even have same-sex now doing it, or the opposite sex doing it in some of the cases.
[02:50:23.289 --> 02:50:25.471]  And so what's the next thing?
[02:50:25.891 --> 02:50:28.213]  It's going to be putting their hands inside you.
[02:50:29.804 --> 02:50:30.905]  Uh-huh.
[02:50:31.005 --> 02:50:31.965]  So what did he say they did?
[02:50:31.985 --> 02:50:32.686]  Just stripped him down?
[02:50:33.806 --> 02:50:34.127]  No, no.
[02:50:34.167 --> 02:50:37.028]  What happened to me as well, I also went out to L.A.
[02:50:37.168 --> 02:50:38.569]  and did the same thing.
[02:50:38.629 --> 02:50:39.930]  I had an expired I.D.
[02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:41.591]  and I wanted to see what would happen.
[02:50:42.231 --> 02:50:44.213]  Dragged into a room, stripped.
[02:50:44.513 --> 02:50:45.193]  Where are you going?
[02:50:45.333 --> 02:50:47.094]  You know, I'm like, you can look at my ticket.
[02:50:47.514 --> 02:50:47.955]  Who are you?
[02:50:48.015 --> 02:50:51.397]  I'm like... Well, they stripped you to humiliate you.
[02:50:51.417 --> 02:50:53.298]  That's in the CIA torture dossiers.
[02:50:53.318 --> 02:50:53.618]  Stay there.
[02:50:53.638 --> 02:50:54.018]  Stay there.
[02:50:54.038 --> 02:50:54.959]  I want to hear the rest of this.
[02:50:55.365 --> 02:50:58.628]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:50:59.449 --> 02:51:03.673]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:03.953 --> 02:51:09.878]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:10.118 --> 02:51:12.260]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:12.541 --> 02:51:18.506]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:18.626 --> 02:51:21.970]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:22.030 --> 02:51:23.732]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:23.912 --> 02:51:25.955]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:26.095 --> 02:51:30.761]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:30.961 --> 02:51:31.602]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:31.782 --> 02:51:35.827]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:36.067 --> 02:51:40.852]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:40.872 --> 02:51:41.993]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:51:42.013 --> 02:51:42.754]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:51:54.810 --> 02:51:59.693]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:51:59.793 --> 02:52:00.554]  What have we got?
[02:52:00.774 --> 02:52:02.895]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:03.215 --> 02:52:03.956]  A republic.
[02:52:04.236 --> 02:52:06.817]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:06.877 --> 02:52:08.799]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:09.139 --> 02:52:11.060]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:11.160 --> 02:52:12.441]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:12.841 --> 02:52:13.962]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:14.162 --> 02:52:14.562]  Children?
[02:52:14.782 --> 02:52:15.563]  Our education?
[02:52:15.903 --> 02:52:16.523]  Our money?
[02:52:16.724 --> 02:52:20.386]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:20.746 --> 02:52:24.411]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:24.451 --> 02:52:25.372]  You're being warned.
[02:52:25.713 --> 02:52:26.534]  We have the facts.
[02:52:26.734 --> 02:52:27.856]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:27.896 --> 02:52:28.777]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:28.817 --> 02:52:29.638]  We have common law.
[02:52:29.698 --> 02:52:31.941]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:32.222 --> 02:52:36.007]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:36.087 --> 02:52:40.893]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:41.053 --> 02:52:42.415]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:42.555 --> 02:52:43.396]  Don't tread on me.

[02:52:59.715 --> 02:53:02.498]  When the unexpected happens, will you be ready?
[02:53:02.778 --> 02:53:09.845]  Hundreds of concerned citizens across America have already installed wind generators to help protect their families in the event of a disaster.

[02:53:37.944 --> 02:53:38.865]  He's going the distance.
[02:53:38.885 --> 02:53:40.005]  He's going for speed.
[02:54:03.792 --> 02:54:06.794]  You know we're out of time and I want to finish up with this caller and others.
[02:54:06.854 --> 02:54:11.498]  I'm tempted to go into overdrive and I would if I wasn't under the weather right now.
[02:54:12.839 --> 02:54:17.543]  I got into some of this economic news earlier but report foreclosure mess could threaten banks AP.
[02:54:19.616 --> 02:54:30.760]  The disarray streaming from flawed foreclosure documents could threaten major banks with billions of dollars in losses, deepen the disruption in the housing market, and hurt the government's effort to keep people in their homes.
[02:54:31.581 --> 02:54:32.941]  It was all done by fraud.
[02:54:32.981 --> 02:54:34.562]  It's much worse than they're even saying.
[02:54:35.302 --> 02:54:39.303]  And you've got the same thing now going on in Ireland and Portugal.
[02:54:39.323 --> 02:54:40.103]  They're going under.
[02:54:40.703 --> 02:54:41.644]  Same thing in Greece.
[02:54:42.304 --> 02:54:44.784]  Every time they get another bailout, it only makes things worse.
[02:54:45.244 --> 02:54:47.865]  Because it's mathematically impossible to pay all this back.
[02:54:47.925 --> 02:54:52.106]  It's been designed to leave only the megabanks still standing.
[02:54:52.726 --> 02:54:59.468]  Euro under siege as Portugal hits the panic button.
[02:55:00.649 --> 02:55:09.171]  Ireland told take EU bailout or trigger crisis and then they take EU taxpayer money and give it to the private bankers paying off the debts.
[02:55:09.491 --> 02:55:11.672]  The bankers make this up out of nothing!
[02:55:13.152 --> 02:55:18.733]  Then they lobby government to get into debt so they get to come in and take over the real assets.
[02:55:18.894 --> 02:55:19.934]  It's elementary!
[02:55:21.474 --> 02:55:27.996]  You know, I've done two hours and 55 minutes today and haven't even talked about PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:36.363]  Every year in late November, December, we give you five months free when you sign up.
[02:55:36.383 --> 02:55:38.344]  5.3 months, we want to be technical.
[02:55:39.605 --> 02:55:42.746]  So you get five plus months free when you sign up for a year.
[02:55:42.766 --> 02:55:44.948]  So you only pay for six months.
[02:55:45.548 --> 02:55:48.569]  A little more than six months, you get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:49.090 --> 02:55:53.112]  It's your PrisonPlanet.tv memberships that also fund so much of what we're doing here.

[02:56:07.561 --> 02:56:15.407]  This platform is so important in the fight against the globalists, and we're having bigger and bigger success every day waking people up.
[02:56:16.067 --> 02:56:19.790]  And thank God we've got your prayers out there or we wouldn't even be on the air.
[02:56:20.210 --> 02:56:22.451]  We are under attack in a lot of ways I don't talk about.
[02:56:22.792 --> 02:56:24.713]  But I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:56:24.733 --> 02:56:26.574]  We couldn't do it without you.
[02:56:26.614 --> 02:56:29.836]  But it takes about a minute to sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:29.877 --> 02:56:32.158]  You can do a trial monthly membership as well, $5.95.

[02:56:43.257 --> 02:56:45.959]  We're adding more and more expanded interviews.
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:49.462]  You don't just get to watch the live radio show and video streaming.
[02:56:49.522 --> 02:56:54.766]  I mean, it's just... PrisonPlanet.tv has never been better than it is now, and we only intend to make it better.
[02:56:55.367 --> 02:57:00.091]  Briefly, finishing up, and I'm sorry to all the other callers, to Emmanuel in Minnesota.
[02:57:00.371 --> 02:57:02.293]  So you then tried to fly out to LA.
[02:57:02.613 --> 02:57:03.914]  Briefly, what did they do to you?
[02:57:04.214 --> 02:57:05.475]  How much did they strip off?
[02:57:05.555 --> 02:57:06.336]  What did they say to you?
[02:57:07.805 --> 02:57:10.147]  Well, when I was at the Minneapolis-St.
[02:57:10.167 --> 02:57:12.508]  Paul International Airport, it began there.
[02:57:12.669 --> 02:57:19.013]  Because my friend told me, he said, look, when I got to the LAX, you won't believe what they did to me.
[02:57:19.433 --> 02:57:22.355]  And when he got here, they did the same thing to him.
[02:57:22.936 --> 02:57:27.839]  So, when I got to the airport, you know, here I am, just an average American citizen.
[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:29.861]  No, I'm not a criminal.
[02:57:29.921 --> 02:57:31.762]  I don't have a criminal background, no background.
[02:57:31.782 --> 02:57:32.863]  No, it's East Germany.
[02:57:32.883 --> 02:57:35.465]  No, no, it's any excuse to train their goons to do this.
[02:57:35.725 --> 02:57:36.585]  We're almost out of time.
[02:57:36.625 --> 02:57:37.246]  What happened to you?
[02:57:38.561 --> 02:57:45.684]  Well, I was strip searched, like I said, and I was asked that I'm gonna make a report on you guys, and they said, well, you can't report to anyone.
[02:57:45.704 --> 02:57:47.184]  You get on the plane or you just leave now.
[02:57:47.525 --> 02:57:51.766]  I'm like, look, you just, you just grabbed my, you know, uh, my genitals here.
[02:57:52.306 --> 02:57:52.847]  With force.
[02:57:53.967 --> 02:57:55.828]  Obviously, they could- Let's be specific!
[02:57:56.008 --> 02:57:57.589]  Did they completely strip you down?
[02:57:58.909 --> 02:58:00.150]  Not completely strip me down.
[02:58:00.410 --> 02:58:03.611]  Forced their hands all around my genitals, all around my buttocks.
[02:58:04.251 --> 02:58:05.872]  Grabbing me by force, that's what happened.
[02:58:06.932 --> 02:58:11.775]  And again, it's thugs violating you like a dog urinating on another dog.
[02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:13.236]  Just pure evil.
[02:58:13.616 --> 02:58:14.396]  God bless you.
[02:58:14.416 --> 02:58:16.177]  Call me back again and tell me the rest of the story.
[02:58:16.217 --> 02:58:16.898]  We're out of time.
[02:58:18.539 --> 02:58:21.280]  Great job to the crew on this live Tuesday edition.
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:23.241]  I'll be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:23.822 --> 02:58:24.342]  Central.
[02:58:25.002 --> 02:58:30.185]  We're going to come back at InfoWars.com in the restreams and get into everything that's happening.
[02:58:30.205 --> 02:58:32.287]  And again, I'll see you back tomorrow.
[02:58:32.307 --> 02:58:33.968]  I've got some big guests coming up in the next few days.
[02:58:36.633 --> 02:58:38.414]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:40.035 --> 02:58:42.155]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:45.977 --> 02:59:00.444]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:59:01.444 --> 02:59:05.126]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:06.144 --> 02:59:09.872]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
