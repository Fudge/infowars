[00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:07.877]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:11.518]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.320]  Well, it's only about a minute delayed.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.141]  I'm here listening to it right now.
[00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:27.403]  It's the Infowars.com Listen Live News Feed iPhone app.
[00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:29.624]  And I can turn it up.
[00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:39.810]  You like that, folks?
[00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.294]  We're going to put the article up on screen for people right now.
[00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:48.957]  Listen to the Alex Jones Show with the new iPhone app.
[00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:49.578]  And guess what?
[00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:51.640]  The best part about it is it's free!
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.124]  Go to InfoWars.com if you have an iPhone or any other type of Apple system.
[00:00:57.144 --> 00:01:00.667]  We're going to launch some other apps soon for the other competing systems.
[00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:03.309]  We intend for this to be really big.
[00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:16.257]  We're also going to launch some other apps soon for PrisonPlanet.tv members to get the videos downloaded or streamed and the live show and the archives of the video when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, at least the second half of the show every day.
[00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:18.178]  Some days we do all four hours of the show.
[00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:21.160]  As you know, many days three hours of the show, but always at least two.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.662]  It is the Alex Jones Show InfoWars.com phone app.
[00:01:26.023 --> 00:01:28.264]  Let's see if the delay is over and we're back live.
[00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:37.289]  You know what I think that did is?
[00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:38.830]  That's a feedback loop.
[00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.994]  That was because at the start of the show I faded it out at the start of that segment and so it went back to the ad.
[00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:45.754]  Listen to this.
[00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:05.311]  Go to Infowars.com if you have an iPhone or any other type of Apple system.
[00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:08.873]  We're going to launch some other apps soon for the other competing systems.
[00:02:09.773 --> 00:02:11.494]  We intend for this to be really big.
[00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:24.100]  We're also going to launch some other apps soon for PrisonPlanet.tv members to get the videos downloaded or streamed and the live show and the archives of the video when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv at least the second half of the show.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.521]  You know, if I shut up, it'll actually end to the dead air from when I shut up.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.843]  It is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com phone app.
[00:02:34.203 --> 00:02:36.485]  Let's see if the delay is over and we're back live.
[00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:52.257]  Okay, that's enough of that.
[00:02:52.457 --> 00:02:53.218]  That's enough of that.
[00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:57.905]  Again, you can also set your alarm so the show comes on with the refeed.
[00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:00.726]  We're going to have it where it feeds you the podcast.
[00:03:00.786 --> 00:03:02.107]  We're just going to add more and more to this.
[00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:03.307]  It's got a bunch of functions.
[00:03:03.747 --> 00:03:04.888]  It's absolutely free.
[00:03:05.308 --> 00:03:09.130]  It's at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.811]  You can go download the first of many apps.
[00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:18.815]  This is just our trial operation here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:24.359]  This is just the start of what we're doing with iPhone apps.
[00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.222]  Absolutely free at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.183]  Show them the article again.
[00:03:29.203 --> 00:03:31.545]  It's the top story on InfoWars.com.
[00:03:31.866 --> 00:03:34.688]  Listen to the Alex Jones Show with the new iPhone app.
[00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:35.269]  Free!
[00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.851]  You might tell Kurt to add the headline, free.
[00:03:38.712 --> 00:03:39.733]  That is the key.
[00:03:40.493 --> 00:03:43.394]  We've had so many people approach us about selling iPhone apps.
[00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:45.015]  No, we're not interested in that.
[00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:49.257]  We want to stream the radio show to everyone for free.
[00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:54.219]  Everything on the internet is going to phones, as you know, in the last two years.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.401]  And we're just going to add more and more and more.
[00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:05.765]  We will have an app for people that are PrisonPlanet.tv members, though, to have access to all the videos and the rest of it.
[00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:07.906]  So you can just download them right to your phone or stream them live.
[00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:11.358]  Let me just go ahead and read Curt Nemo's story.
[00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:13.359]  Do we have Wayne Madsen with us yet?
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.621]  Fantastic.
[00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.462]  So we're going to go to him in just a moment.
[00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.824]  But I first wanted to just read part of this article.
[00:04:20.864 --> 00:04:23.525]  Listen to the Alex Jones Show with the new iPhone app.
[00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.948]  Want to listen to the Alex Jones Show on your iPhone or iPod Touch?
[00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:32.311]  Apple's iTunes Store and Stormy Productions are now offering.
[00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:40.027]  An app dedicated to listening to Alex's nationally syndicated radio program over the internet.
[00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.154]  The app is an excellent opportunity to listen to the Alex Jones Show while you're on the run.
[00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:59.637]  The new app plays the live radio stream, has a built-in web browser alarm clock, and runs in the background so you can use other apps while listening.
[00:04:59.877 --> 00:05:06.701]  The service requires iPhone OS 3.0 or later, and the internet connection using Wi-Fi 3G or Edge.
[00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:13.344]  3G or 3rd generation is a service offered by ITT.
[00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:18.807]  And it goes on to say Edge is a digital mobile phone system that is widely used in Europe and other parts of the world.
[00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:23.810]  And we are very, very excited about that.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.465]  So again, that is available at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:37.955 --> 00:05:43.080]  Right now, and I want Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson to write articles about this, because this is great.
[00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:46.804]  And again, the fight is on the internet.
[00:05:46.844 --> 00:05:48.125]  That's where we're waking people up.
[00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:57.115]  Please let your friends, your family, please let other people know about this.
[00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:19.278]  Please tell your email list, your MySpace, your Twitter, your Facebook about the new free iPhone app available at InfoWars.com today.
[00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:25.823]  We're going to again be launching more in the near future, but very, very exciting this type of portability out there.
[00:06:27.044 --> 00:06:35.328]  Let's go ahead and go to Wayne Madsen, who I appreciate joining us today here on the Radio Slash TV Show.
[00:06:35.888 --> 00:06:40.550]  Wayne Madsen is an investigative journalist, nationally distributed columnist, and author who has covered Washington, D.C.
[00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.211]  politics, national security, and intelligence issues since 1994.
[00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:49.513]  He has written for the Village Voice, the Progressive CAQ, Counterpunch, and the Intelligence Newsletter.
[00:06:49.553 --> 00:06:50.394]  Madsen is the author.
[00:06:50.974 --> 00:06:51.114]  Okay.
[00:07:11.374 --> 00:07:12.336]  Hi Alex, good to be with you again.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.980]  Thanks for spending time.
[00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:30.881]  So much is going on.
[00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:34.063]  I have my big list of questions and points I want to go over with you.
[00:07:34.503 --> 00:07:38.085]  Obviously the latest on the crotch bomber, Sybil Edmonds' information.
[00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:41.767]  I had Michael Springman on yesterday.
[00:07:41.807 --> 00:07:51.511]  He just came right out now and said inside job 9-11, the Muslims, Al-Qaeda is a CIA brigade used to destabilize countries including the U.S.
[00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:52.632]  and bring in police state.
[00:07:53.112 --> 00:07:54.554]  The underwear bomber, it's on record.
[00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:55.315]  I want you to go over that.
[00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:56.576]  Just completely government-off.
[00:07:56.596 --> 00:07:59.840]  State Department admits they were ordered by CIA to let him in and protect him.
[00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:03.884]  The naked body scanners, it's come out that they're recording it and saving it.
[00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:08.069]  I mean, so much is going on, but what else is on your front burner?
[00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.232]  What else do you think is important we should know about Wayne Madsen?
[00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:17.164]  Well, I have a story up today on my website, and this is going to boggle people's minds.
[00:08:17.204 --> 00:08:36.270]  We're being told that all this stuff about derivatives and sovereign debt, they're talking in terms of trillions of dollars, but really the amount of money that's at stake, that's put at risk right now, right now it's in the quadrillions.
[00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.291]  And this came from a Federal Reserve source.
[00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:44.177]  I mean, that operation thrives on secrecy.
[00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:45.878]  But here's the thing.
[00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:48.821]  We're talking about quadrillions now.
[00:08:49.722 --> 00:08:53.346]  There was a question posed internally at the Federal Reserve.
[00:08:53.927 --> 00:08:55.789]  These are economists, of course.
[00:08:56.289 --> 00:08:56.669]  We're good.
[00:09:16.196 --> 00:09:18.618]  I don't think so.
[00:09:33.968 --> 00:09:39.650]  And the former French Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepinte, cited this document.
[00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:42.412]  Later, the neocons said, oh, that's a forgery.
[00:09:42.432 --> 00:09:44.873]  See, the neocons produce forgeries.
[00:09:44.933 --> 00:09:46.273]  They want everyone to believe them.
[00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:51.596]  But when there's a document that comes out that they don't like, they say that's a forgery.
[00:09:52.056 --> 00:09:54.837]  So Nicolas Sarkozy, the neocon,
[00:09:55.376 --> 00:10:00.180]  President of France has been trying to bring criminal charges against de Villepin.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.525]  He's afraid that de Villepin will challenge him for the French presidency in the next election.
[00:10:05.545 --> 00:10:09.808]  And if he's found guilty, he was just acquitted of these charges.
[00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.931]  But Sartosi, who's a real sneak,
[00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:14.272]  We're good to go.
[00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:34.714]  And if they succeed in convicting DeVille Pan, of course, that knocks them out of the presidential race.
[00:10:34.754 --> 00:10:41.236]  But with DeVille Pan as president of France, the neocons are going to maybe lose France.
[00:10:41.316 --> 00:10:47.019]  They just lost Ukraine because the Orange Revolution that was financed by George Soros
[00:10:47.959 --> 00:11:10.966]  Is dead, because Viktor Yanukovych, who's a Ukrainian nationalist who has no time for Ukraine and NATO or any of these other contrivances, won that election, beat the Orange Revolution woman, Yulia Tymoshenko, so Ukraine is no longer in the hip pocket of the neocons, and now the battle looks like it's going to move to France.
[00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:20.186]  I want to come back and continue with the whole geopolitical layer of the land and integrate that with China saying they want a hardline Cold War with the U.S.
[00:11:20.787 --> 00:11:25.771]  Their PLA commanders, the top generals, and their military council calling for dumping the U.S.
[00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:27.873]  bonds to quote, punish the United States.
[00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:29.395]  We've got Hillary threatening
[00:11:29.995 --> 00:11:32.917]  them with sanctions if they don't put sanctions on Iran.
[00:11:33.438 --> 00:11:35.480]  Are they planning to go into Iran, Wayne Madsen?
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.300]  We'll talk about that.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:47.289]  Why is Sarah Palin and four neocon publications, including National Review, calling for Obama to play the war card and preemptively attack Iran?
[00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.432]  What's the intel you're getting in D.C.
[00:11:51.112 --> 00:11:56.597]  as you're snowed in by the incredible global warming, record snowfall in the last 50 years in D.C.
[00:11:56.657 --> 00:11:57.057]  right now?
[00:11:57.097 --> 00:11:58.818]  Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:11:58.838 --> 00:11:59.179]  Stay with us.

[00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:46.483]  Go to ilikevitamins.com.
[00:12:46.523 --> 00:12:48.304]  That's ilikevitamins.com.
[00:12:48.364 --> 00:12:49.225]  Or call 2-5-6-4-4-4-8-thousand.
[00:12:49.245 --> 00:12:49.805]  2-5-6-4-4-4-8-thousand.
[00:12:51.647 --> 00:12:52.488]  We're good to go.
[00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:09.894]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:13:10.175 --> 00:13:16.218]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:13:16.598 --> 00:13:25.463]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:13:25.823 --> 00:13:34.747]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:13:35.008 --> 00:13:39.590]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.171]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:43.912]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:13:44.212 --> 00:13:45.093]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:51.357]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:52.318]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:13:52.338 --> 00:13:52.738]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:13:52.758 --> 00:13:55.540]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.601]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:13:57.901 --> 00:13:58.942]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:14:10.672 --> 00:14:13.333]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:19.575]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:24.777]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:14:24.937 --> 00:14:34.920]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.142]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:14:37.382 --> 00:14:38.703]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:14:38.963 --> 00:14:41.245]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:43.267]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:14:43.547 --> 00:14:48.371]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:53.475]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:14:53.715 --> 00:14:57.818]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:15:01.428 --> 00:15:03.710]  Our economy is in great distress.
[00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.192]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[00:15:07.853 --> 00:15:12.576]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen, and prepare just in case it does.
[00:15:13.377 --> 00:15:15.178]  You have auto and home insurance.
[00:15:16.038 --> 00:15:18.120]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[00:15:19.261 --> 00:15:21.923]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:24.424]  Because it might take years to recover.
[00:15:25.205 --> 00:15:30.869]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[00:15:31.724 --> 00:15:39.050]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:46.276]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[00:15:47.177 --> 00:15:50.739]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.465]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:16.265]  We're also going to get into the cyber security bill that's passed the House, which they admit the President can then shut down the web to, quote, protect it.
[00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:22.269]  Recruiting youth corps that are going to, for the Pentagon, battle disinformation in the U.S.
[00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.270]  and attack bloggers.
[00:16:24.031 --> 00:16:26.352]  Generals saying they may start killing U.S.
[00:16:26.392 --> 00:16:26.893]  reporters.
[00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:29.395]  I mean, this is getting crazy because we're hurting the system.
[00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:37.652]  Wayne, continuing with the whole geopolitical breakdown of what's happening, and China talking about dumping its bonds.
[00:16:37.953 --> 00:16:39.957]  Geithner comes out and says, don't worry, we're safe.
[00:16:40.017 --> 00:16:40.618]  What's going on?
[00:16:41.485 --> 00:16:48.989]  Well, it looks like what the Obama administration is trying to do is try to recreate some semblance of a Cold War.
[00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:56.874]  Obviously, the whole thing about non-state terrorist actors, Al-Qaeda, is falling apart on them.
[00:16:57.334 --> 00:16:59.235]  So they've got to go after state players.
[00:16:59.315 --> 00:17:00.476]  And China, of course, is
[00:17:01.096 --> 00:17:03.677]  Is a emerging superpower.
[00:17:04.157 --> 00:17:17.222]  The Obama administration has announced the sale of weapons to Taiwan, which is a real slap at the Chinese, who basically have us, you know, they have us, you know, where the sun doesn't shine.
[00:17:18.082 --> 00:17:30.186]  Financially, they own our debt, they own our notes, and this is just sort of like Cold War era brinkmanship, only not with nuclear weapons, but with threats of
[00:17:32.988 --> 00:17:40.694]  Is this the hope and change message that everybody was expecting to see?
[00:17:40.714 --> 00:17:44.617]  A chill on US-Chinese relations?
[00:17:44.637 --> 00:17:50.722]  Now, China's no angel, of course, but we deal with a lot of countries around the world that have dictators.
[00:17:51.443 --> 00:17:53.164]  We can choose them very carefully.
[00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:55.166]  We refuse to have relations with Cuba.
[00:17:55.666 --> 00:18:16.295]  But we have no problem dealing with the Saudis and the Egyptians, their dictatorships, but we hold our nose now at Iran and Hillary, of course, stating that she wants China to join the Western powers in ratcheting up tensions with Iran.
[00:18:16.335 --> 00:18:18.736]  I would note that Iran, with this whole issue of
[00:18:19.456 --> 00:18:20.676]  Uh, enriching uranium.
[00:18:20.716 --> 00:18:22.937]  Right now they're at 3% enriched uranium.
[00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:33.840]  They're jumping that up to 20% enrichment because they need it for nuclear medicine and also for their power plant.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:39.881]  You need 90% enriched uranium to develop a bomb, and they're nowhere close to that.
[00:18:40.001 --> 00:18:47.163]  But isn't it interesting, what they didn't like was this deal being worked out where Iran would ship its current uranium to be enriched.
[00:18:47.691 --> 00:18:47.971]  I think so.
[00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:04.826]  Let me throw this out there.
[00:19:04.866 --> 00:19:06.408]  They've always brought the U.N.
[00:19:07.048 --> 00:19:07.188]  in.
[00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:08.430]  They've given in to the U.N.
[00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.991]  unlike any other nation ever has.
[00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:12.153]  They always report their new facilities.
[00:19:12.433 --> 00:19:14.855]  They say, okay, so it's not weapons grade.
[00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:17.698]  We'll let China, your ally, do it.
[00:19:18.138 --> 00:19:20.100]  And they go, no, we must have war.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.261]  We've seen Sarah Palin.
[00:19:21.842 --> 00:19:26.446]  We've seen all these other neocons come out and say we must have
[00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:31.809]  War, Huckabee, the National Review, we must have war now.
[00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:36.432]  I mean, they're saying we must, and Israel's saying, we want, quote, crippling sanctions.
[00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:46.118]  Well, right, and isn't it interesting, all this happens after Poppy Bush and Jeb Bush make this unannounced visit to the White House.
[00:19:46.846 --> 00:19:48.227]  I believe it was about a week ago.
[00:19:48.327 --> 00:19:49.248]  What's the word on that?
[00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:50.128]  What was really happening?
[00:19:50.508 --> 00:19:51.469]  No one really knows.
[00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:55.011]  They said it was just a personal meeting.
[00:19:55.191 --> 00:19:56.452]  There's no personal meetings.
[00:19:56.952 --> 00:19:59.714]  We just sauntered into the White House like that.
[00:20:00.194 --> 00:20:04.657]  And I think it's very interesting that George W. Bush, when he was on Meet the Press with
[00:20:05.557 --> 00:20:15.222]  Bill Clinton, trying to raise money for Haiti relief, said something about, well, you've got to be careful about who you give money to, because there's a lot of shysters that show up.
[00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:32.530]  Well, if George W. Bush was even paying an iota of attention when he was president for eight years, he might know who the shysters are, and it would be interesting to get him to actually say, because of course he was sitting next to one of the biggest shysters around, Bill Clinton.
[00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.590]  I don't
[00:20:50.796 --> 00:20:52.657]  You know, you've got to be careful with shysters.
[00:20:53.317 --> 00:21:05.321]  You know what, it would be interesting if Bush actually, you know, in some moment of lucidity would actually start talking about the shysters he encountered as President of the United States.
[00:21:05.341 --> 00:21:11.523]  He might go a little bit towards redeeming himself, although I don't think he'll ever redeem himself.
[00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:13.024]  He's got too much blood on his hands.
[00:21:14.264 --> 00:21:24.710]  Let's remember, Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican who left that party in total disgust and ran as a bull-moose progressive, ranting and raving about the power of the corporations.
[00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:34.915]  So there is a possibility he could go that direction, but certainly no one knows what that meeting in the White House was about.
[00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:38.357]  Maybe they were giving Obama his marching orders.
[00:21:39.315 --> 00:21:43.317]  Let's get into cyber security and a lot more coming up, plus the underwear bomber.
[00:21:45.118 --> 00:21:47.119]  Straight ahead with Wayne Madsen, our guest.
[00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:47.720]  Stay with us.
[00:21:50.641 --> 00:21:51.542]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.042 --> 00:21:53.643]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:57.265]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.458 --> 00:22:03.060]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.443]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:08.803 --> 00:22:10.544]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:10.844 --> 00:22:15.667]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:15.847 --> 00:22:16.768]  How much do you want?
[00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:17.769]  When do you want it?
[00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:19.750]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:20.031 --> 00:22:20.851]  When will you need it?
[00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:23.173]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:23.313 --> 00:22:24.414]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:25.975]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:26.176 --> 00:22:31.260]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.643]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:35.023 --> 00:22:38.506]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:38.846 --> 00:22:39.826]  How much will you need?
[00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:40.667]  We don't know.
[00:22:40.967 --> 00:22:41.867]  How much do you want?
[00:22:42.067 --> 00:22:42.807]  All you can get.
[00:22:42.987 --> 00:22:43.847]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:44.088 --> 00:22:46.868]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:48.889]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:49.849]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:22:59.412 --> 00:23:03.395]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:06.257]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:23:06.397 --> 00:23:08.358]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:23:08.478 --> 00:23:10.600]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.241]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:23:12.381 --> 00:23:16.704]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:23:16.844 --> 00:23:19.126]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.122]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:23:59.136 --> 00:24:03.361]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:07.765]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:24:08.026 --> 00:24:13.432]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:24:13.772 --> 00:24:14.233]  It's true.
[00:24:14.513 --> 00:24:19.078]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:24:19.378 --> 00:24:19.918]  Number 3.
[00:24:20.199 --> 00:24:23.481]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:27.523]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:24:27.704 --> 00:24:28.244]  Number 4.
[00:24:28.504 --> 00:24:30.866]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:24:31.266 --> 00:24:34.648]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:24:34.948 --> 00:24:35.149]  Number 5.
[00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:39.652]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:24:39.872 --> 00:24:44.635]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:24:44.935 --> 00:24:48.957]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:24:49.097 --> 00:24:50.658]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:24:50.878 --> 00:24:52.979]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:55.720]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:07.485]  By the way, I just want to add for listeners this important point.
[00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:12.187]  The iPhone app is free at infowars.com.
[00:25:16.829 --> 00:25:18.950]  Okay, it's absolutely free.
[00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.791]  And if you have an iPhone, it's very easy.
[00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:21.851]  You just download our app.
[00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:25.172]  It's free at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:25.192 --> 00:25:28.734]  I guess there's some other people selling apps we just learned of I don't even know about.
[00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:29.734]  That's separate from us.
[00:25:29.974 --> 00:25:31.055]  Ours is free.
[00:25:31.475 --> 00:25:32.475]  People selling them in our name.
[00:25:32.495 --> 00:25:38.218]  I've got to stop that because I just can't let people, you know, take our name and use it and do stuff and then claim they're us later.
[00:25:38.558 --> 00:25:40.018]  We've had that happen over and over again.
[00:25:40.459 --> 00:25:40.999]  It's free.
[00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:45.840]  It's like you can watch my films for free online, or get the DVDs and make copies of them.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.822]  We hope you get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership to see it first and in higher quality, and to download it and use it.
[00:25:52.082 --> 00:25:54.623]  We hope you buy the DVDs, but that's not the mission.
[00:25:55.523 --> 00:26:04.806]  The mission is, yes, to fund our operation, but funding the operation is only the launchpad to battle the globalists, and shadow the left-right paradigm, and warn the people.
[00:26:05.366 --> 00:26:06.867]  Going back to Wayne Madsen,
[00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:13.218]  I mean, there's so much to cover here, so much going on, so much happening.
[00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:20.682]  What would you say the state is of the US, Israel, and England that are all allied together with the EU?
[00:26:20.702 --> 00:26:22.403]  Because all over the world,
[00:26:24.364 --> 00:26:29.449]  Resistance is mounting to the fact that our nations have been captured and are being used as engines of tyranny.
[00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:37.558]  And you talked about how all over the world, people are now recognizing this new equivalent to the former Soviet tyranny, the evil empire.
[00:26:37.938 --> 00:26:39.680]  The people in America are waking up.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.863]  Both political parties' approval ratings are plunging.
[00:26:43.897 --> 00:26:46.418]  And so the system is going to strike back.
[00:26:46.478 --> 00:26:50.059]  How are they doing that with the new cybersecurity system, I guess?
[00:26:50.079 --> 00:26:53.180]  Because I've read the cybersecurity bill in the House that passed.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.240]  The Senate's even worse.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.361]  I mean, I can't believe what's in this.
[00:26:57.381 --> 00:26:58.841]  I'm going to be covering it more next hour.
[00:26:59.222 --> 00:27:00.202]  I know you know about it.
[00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:07.504]  But I don't think people realize that Microsoft is building all these cybersecurity centers, being paid by the federal government openly to censor.
[00:27:07.524 --> 00:27:08.784]  Bill Gates is saying it's good.
[00:27:09.244 --> 00:27:10.585]  Time Magazine Newsweek.
[00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:22.748]  British papers, New York Times saying you're going to have an internet ID to get online, biometric scan, all IT facilities even down to people that serve a hundred customers or more.
[00:27:22.968 --> 00:27:24.448]  That's the most tiny ISP.
[00:27:24.688 --> 00:27:31.750]  We'll have to put government monitoring software openly snooping and that runs your system so they can ban any websites they want.
[00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.591]  Now InfoWars and Prison Planet along with WikiLeaks.
[00:27:35.331 --> 00:27:40.399]  An Electronic Frontiers Foundation are suddenly getting banned by ISPs from New Zealand to Italy?
[00:27:40.679 --> 00:27:42.121]  I mean, they're moving, sir!
[00:27:43.749 --> 00:27:46.650]  Absolutely.
[00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:57.813]  I spent a long time in computer security, and there's a lot of reasons to have a lot of countermeasures in place, but what we're seeing here is something much more than that.
[00:27:57.893 --> 00:28:01.594]  We have the National Security Agency cutting a deal with Google.
[00:28:02.034 --> 00:28:05.775]  They've already had deals with Motorola, with Intel, with Microsoft.
[00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:13.877]  This is basically building intelligence inside, to paraphrase the old Intel slogan, Intel Inside.
[00:28:14.277 --> 00:28:15.877]  And that's what we're going to see.
[00:28:15.917 --> 00:28:33.721]  And then you couple these initiatives, like the cybersecurity bill with Cass Sunstein, who's the head of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, who basically has come out and said it's the job of the government to basically break
[00:28:34.301 --> 00:28:38.485]  He uses the word conspiracy theorist.
[00:28:38.525 --> 00:28:46.151]  He wrote a book called Infotopia where he talks about the danger of people who don't engage in the group thing being pushed by the corporate media.
[00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:54.157]  And I think when you have Sunstein, who by the way I hear, there may be two vacancies on the Supreme Court.
[00:28:55.058 --> 00:28:57.240]  Stevens may be leaving as well as Ginsburg.
[00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:00.982]  And he may be on the short list, from what I'm hearing.
[00:29:01.002 --> 00:29:03.584]  He was on the list last time with Sotomayor!
[00:29:04.204 --> 00:29:16.550]  Right, and this is a nightmare to have a guy like that, you know, basically preaching censorship and infiltrating groups that they don't agree with.
[00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:21.592]  This is right out of COINTELPRO in the 1960s and 70s.
[00:29:21.612 --> 00:29:27.035]  The FBI did, they infiltrated various anti-war groups, civil rights groups, and others.
[00:29:27.635 --> 00:29:33.961]  But you couple all these things together and you don't need a crystal ball to see where they're going.
[00:29:34.381 --> 00:29:35.862]  They have to control the Internet.
[00:29:35.882 --> 00:29:54.239]  The Internet was developed with DOD money, but it's turned out to be something that is helping to illuminate what's going on with these various power centers around the world, especially, as I said, what the neocons are up to with their
[00:29:54.859 --> 00:30:01.805]  Total disinformation campaign going after world, you know, politicians who aren't falling in line.
[00:30:02.385 --> 00:30:05.568]  And I think it's something that everybody has to be concerned about.
[00:30:05.628 --> 00:30:21.541]  As a matter of fact, I've gone ahead and bought an old Underwood typewriter because if they shut down the net, I'll have that and I'll get an old mimeograph machine and I'll just go back to the way it used to be and start putting out this information in leaflets like with
[00:30:22.942 --> 00:30:25.323]  And by the way, Wayne, you're not joking.
[00:30:25.403 --> 00:30:36.148]  I put out an internet video this morning that's already gone viral, and in 10 minutes, 50 seconds, I break down everything that's happening.
[00:30:36.189 --> 00:30:38.230]  We show all the government documents and announcements.
[00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.731]  The White House says they're going to force us over to Internet 2.
[00:30:42.311 --> 00:30:43.652]  No one will have freedom of speech.
[00:30:43.692 --> 00:30:44.993]  We'll all have subdomains.
[00:30:45.013 --> 00:30:46.954]  They're going to incrementally shut down the old web.
[00:30:47.734 --> 00:30:57.761]  All these indexes of banned sites are going into the ISPs right now and all the big newspapers are calling for censoring alternative media because we're kicking their butts.
[00:30:58.041 --> 00:31:00.323]  The truth is trumping their lies.
[00:31:00.383 --> 00:31:01.523]  They're all going bankrupt.
[00:31:01.543 --> 00:31:06.727]  So it's a perfect storm of government, corporations and media that can't compete with the truth.
[00:31:07.067 --> 00:31:15.473]  They are really starting to drop the hammer and I think it's important to get the word out now to scream bloody murder because if we don't respond to them just
[00:31:16.013 --> 00:31:23.050]  Test firing or beta testing or trial ballooning the idea of censoring the web.
[00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:24.574]  I mean, this is clearly a test right now.
[00:31:24.594 --> 00:31:25.015]  Do you agree?
[00:31:25.856 --> 00:31:31.822]  Oh, I think there's, yeah, they're floating all kinds of trial balloons here to see just how far they can go.
[00:31:31.922 --> 00:31:35.265]  And if, you know, you give them an inch, they're going to take 10,000 miles.
[00:31:36.026 --> 00:31:46.617]  And certainly, you know, I look at the, I pick up the Washington Post now, and it rivals Pravda during the days of the Soviet Union with its
[00:31:47.341 --> 00:31:48.641]  Total disinformation.
[00:31:49.382 --> 00:31:52.082]  The Washington Post is owned by an education company.
[00:31:52.122 --> 00:31:54.663]  They no longer really are in the news business.
[00:31:55.303 --> 00:31:56.224]  They run Cap.
[00:31:56.584 --> 00:31:58.684]  They have Cap on business.
[00:31:59.025 --> 00:32:01.265]  It's a training and education company.
[00:32:03.226 --> 00:32:12.789]  And you can't believe anything they print about education issues because they're trying to push the privatization of public education.
[00:32:13.409 --> 00:32:15.690]  And it doesn't stop there.
[00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:16.950]  Everything they write about
[00:32:17.917 --> 00:32:20.918]  For example, they covered the Ukrainian election.
[00:32:20.958 --> 00:32:29.081]  They started out by saying Viktor Yanukovych, a one-time party boss, who was accused of criminal activity.
[00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:30.202]  That's the first sentence.
[00:32:30.402 --> 00:32:34.983]  I mean, they don't say anything about who backs these neocons in these various countries.
[00:32:37.044 --> 00:32:37.785]  Let's shift gears.
[00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:02.796]  I want to get into the underwear bomber.
[00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:09.640]  I know the audience knows this, but the general public, it's been in ABC News, Detroit News, but buried in the articles.
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.101]  This has now been out for a week and a half.
[00:33:12.562 --> 00:33:13.802]  Oh yeah, it's true.
[00:33:13.842 --> 00:33:15.163]  There was a sharp-dressed man.
[00:33:15.844 --> 00:33:17.725]  The State Department was told by U.S.
[00:33:17.765 --> 00:33:21.167]  intelligence to let him in because they didn't want to tip off Al-Qaeda.
[00:33:21.467 --> 00:33:24.549]  And yeah, there was a second man on the plane that did have a bomb, but
[00:33:25.049 --> 00:33:28.591]  And Kurt Haskell did tell the truth, but we're not going to talk about that.
[00:33:29.071 --> 00:33:32.233]  I mean, this is another false flag, another setup.
[00:33:33.534 --> 00:33:35.175]  Undoubtedly, it was a false flag.
[00:33:35.215 --> 00:33:39.097]  And we got information that he flew with a one-way ticket.
[00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:39.997]  Not true.
[00:33:40.057 --> 00:33:41.018]  It was round-trip.
[00:33:41.418 --> 00:33:42.059]  They changed it.
[00:33:42.079 --> 00:33:46.361]  He was supposed to fly back to Accra, Ghana, where that ticket was originally purchased with cash.
[00:33:46.921 --> 00:33:49.623]  They changed it so he would fly back to Lagos, Nigeria.
[00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:56.146]  So we got all this disinformation about Muttalib, and now we hear he's cooperating with U.S.
[00:33:56.247 --> 00:33:58.308]  intelligence to turn it over.
[00:33:58.629 --> 00:34:13.423]  It sounds like he's being debriefed, more than anything else, that he was an agent of influence who was used, and now whatever he's talking about, it sounds like a typical intelligence agent debriefing as far as I'm concerned, and I think it wasn't
[00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:14.384]  I think so.
[00:34:27.063 --> 00:34:36.988]  And in the debriefing, he comes out and says, Al-Qaeda will hit in the next three to six months, devastating exactly what they wanted to hear.
[00:34:37.928 --> 00:34:44.271]  And then they run out, and they have all the intelligence chiefs before Congress last week and said, we will be hit.
[00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:51.094]  And notice this all kicks off right as they mass forces in Yemen, just like they mass forces in and around Afghanistan right before 9-11.
[00:34:51.915 --> 00:34:53.676]  And again, it's hidden in plain view.
[00:34:54.796 --> 00:35:11.334]  And in a few major newspapers and publications, but just buried in the article, okay, Mr. Kennedy, the head of the subdivision of the State Department, says they were ordered by the CIA to let him get in, even though he didn't have a visa, and yeah, somebody got him through security and got him on board the plane.
[00:35:11.554 --> 00:35:16.380]  I mean, who's a sharp-dressed man that can lead you up through security, past the body scanners, which
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.841]  That airport had, that's on record, and get him on the plane.
[00:35:20.221 --> 00:35:22.742]  Only high-level security can do that.
[00:35:22.862 --> 00:35:24.662]  And they admit they helped him get on.
[00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:26.703]  They just don't say they were the sharp-dressed man.
[00:35:26.983 --> 00:35:29.264]  They deny the sharp-dressed man, now they admit it.
[00:35:29.964 --> 00:35:31.484]  But they say, we're not worried about that.
[00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:33.165]  I mean, how obvious?
[00:35:33.305 --> 00:35:37.746]  And then his dad knows they're setting him up, goes and says he's gonna attack you, and nothing's done.
[00:35:38.046 --> 00:35:41.187]  But meanwhile, women are having their breasts groped at the airports.
[00:35:42.051 --> 00:35:58.310]  Right, and we know that the company responsible for security at Amsterdam was ICPS, this Israeli operation that also did the security at the Galle Airport in Paris and allowed Richard Reed, the shoe bomber, to get on that American Airlines flight to Miami.
[00:35:58.991 --> 00:36:00.973]  And isn't that interesting?
[00:36:02.114 --> 00:36:05.977]  Richard Reid had also boarded an El Al flight earlier to Tel Aviv.
[00:36:06.017 --> 00:36:18.968]  Now, if this guy is so dangerous, I mean, El Al is supposed to have the strictest security in the world, but he was allowed to get on that plane because we were told then they wanted to see who he was meeting in Israel.
[00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:20.930]  That's the same story here, so let's...
[00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:22.991]  I mean, that's on record.
[00:36:23.131 --> 00:36:23.932]  Exactly, Wayne.
[00:36:23.952 --> 00:36:24.472]  Absolutely.
[00:36:24.672 --> 00:36:36.001]  And then, days after it happens, not just billions of naked body scanners worldwide, but Israel says, we may get a contract with Homeland Security to run everything because we know how to keep you safe.
[00:36:36.381 --> 00:36:39.263]  Meanwhile, it's an Israeli company that lets them all get on board.
[00:36:39.884 --> 00:36:44.888]  Well, I think it's just another indication of the, you know, what interest, who benefited from this.
[00:36:44.968 --> 00:36:46.469]  Of course, Chair Cobb benefits.
[00:36:47.211 --> 00:36:48.772]  And so did David Kelly and everybody else.
[00:36:48.792 --> 00:36:50.493]  It just continues.
[00:36:50.613 --> 00:36:51.974]  And expanding from there,
[00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:22.493]  Looking into your crystal ball, all your NSA, CIA contacts, are they planning to attack Iran?
[00:37:22.533 --> 00:37:24.294]  Because they're openly saying they will.
[00:37:24.634 --> 00:37:28.535]  The neocons are threatening Obama, saying you will attack or you're a first-termer.
[00:37:29.296 --> 00:37:33.717]  I'm sure you saw the Sarah Palin clips about, I would declare war on Iran and hit them now.
[00:37:33.978 --> 00:37:36.238]  That's what Obama should do, play the war card.
[00:37:36.659 --> 00:37:38.919]  We've got neocons saying, man, we sure need another 9-11.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.001]  You know, we were as happy as pigs and you know what?
[00:37:42.381 --> 00:37:44.782]  I mean, this is really, they might as well,
[00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:57.548]  Think back three years ago, Wayne, when they had five of the former Pentagon generals, who were the five network military correspondents, in that audio tape that one of the aides recorded, going, man, we sure need another 9-11.
[00:37:57.909 --> 00:37:58.609]  It sure helped us.
[00:37:58.629 --> 00:37:59.550]  What are we going to do, Rumsfeld?
[00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.250]  And he goes, it's hard.
[00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:03.472]  Let's talk later.
[00:38:03.812 --> 00:38:05.152]  I mean, we played that audio.
[00:38:05.253 --> 00:38:07.834]  They almost say they did it in that tape.
[00:38:08.439 --> 00:38:08.939]  Right.
[00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:21.067]  And also, it's interesting what's coming out of the Chilcot Inquiry in London, looking about how Britain was forced to go against, join this war against Iraq.
[00:38:21.788 --> 00:38:36.938]  And just out today, we're reading about how some memos were released that state that, you know, this whole thing about France blocking the war effort in the UN Security Council, there was a plan, if France doesn't go along, we're going to engage in an anti-French
[00:38:37.838 --> 00:38:48.263]  And by the way, France helped found this country.
[00:38:50.044 --> 00:38:54.607]  Of my Heinz 57, I'm mainly English and Welsh, so I'm not bashing the British people.
[00:38:54.927 --> 00:38:58.348]  But Britain is now sold as the founder of America.
[00:38:58.448 --> 00:39:01.050]  No, France are not a bunch of surrender monkeys.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.821]  Absolutely.
[00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:25.999]  And, of course, the two people who were most against France getting involved with that and really basically called them on, called Britain, Bush and Blair, on this whole phony argument about WMDs in Iraq, it was President Chirac and Dominique de Villepin, the man that Sarkozy is trying to put in prison.
[00:39:26.439 --> 00:39:27.500]  He does not want that.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.983]  He does not want de Villepin to be the next president of France because
[00:39:31.503 --> 00:39:33.304]  He takes over the Élysée Palace.
[00:39:33.724 --> 00:39:38.025]  He's in a position to expose even more of these crimes by the neocons.
[00:39:38.045 --> 00:39:48.329]  Well, you notice that in 1950, 1946, when NATO got set up, that France said, give us our nukes, get out of our country.
[00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:54.491]  They found out NATO was planning to take over like the Vichy French had done in 1941 for Hitler.
[00:39:55.091 --> 00:39:57.472]  He found out about that and
[00:39:58.519 --> 00:40:02.365]  De Gaulle did, so the British tried to kill him repeatedly with a jackal.
[00:40:02.425 --> 00:40:03.246]  That's on record.
[00:40:03.787 --> 00:40:06.711]  And it's clear Sarkozy isn't even French.
[00:40:07.392 --> 00:40:11.017]  He's this enemy agent coming in, and they joined NATO again.
[00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:28.385]  Right, and they, you know, sending more troops to Afghanistan and this whole thing was to basically eliminate France as one of the countries that stands in the way of the goals of the neocons to basically, you know, let's be frank, take over the world.
[00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:29.646]  That's what their contention is.
[00:40:30.106 --> 00:40:41.774]  And now we see these bankers that are trying to bring down the euro by attacking what they call the pigs, which is Portugal, Italy, maybe Ireland could be in there too, Greece and Spain.
[00:40:42.194 --> 00:40:51.701]  The Greek trade unions are going out on a strike because they're being told you're not going to be able to retire at 63, you're not going to get pensions and all this other thing.
[00:40:52.341 --> 00:41:01.890]  Yeah, they're getting upset like American workers should be because they're now in the banking rules saying the government may take your pensions and then tax it and give you part of it back.
[00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.832]  They're not going to insure money markets.
[00:41:04.172 --> 00:41:06.014]  I mean, my God, this is bad.
[00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:07.149]  Right.
[00:41:07.229 --> 00:41:22.756]  And also, we're also seeing an attack on Japan trying to bring down the value of the N-bike, this whole thing about Toyota, when in fact the parts that are made for those Toyota cars are made by an Indian-owned U.S.
[00:41:22.816 --> 00:41:23.837]  company in Indiana.
[00:41:24.757 --> 00:41:27.199]  Does that sound like industrial espionage to you?
[00:41:27.459 --> 00:41:28.320]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.942]  It's economic warfare, industrial espionage.
[00:41:31.282 --> 00:41:33.604]  They're trying to get at the end through Toyota.
[00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:38.348]  This is Ray Levine, the Republican Transportation Secretary, doing this.
[00:41:38.548 --> 00:41:49.938]  And it just goes to show that the people in charge of Treasury, Geithner and Bernanke and Obama and Emmanuelle and all these people are really not much different than what we had in the past.
[00:41:50.738 --> 00:42:06.147]  Absolutely, and I noticed today that there's now some pushback by some Democrats in Congress against Rahm Emanuel.
[00:42:06.207 --> 00:42:14.172]  I mean, I knew that they were there, but now they're starting to go on record, which indicates that Emanuel has really poisoned the way
[00:42:14.272 --> 00:42:14.653]  That's right.
[00:42:14.673 --> 00:42:18.377]  You know what, let's do five more minutes on the other side, Wayne, because I want to talk about Emmanuel.
[00:42:18.397 --> 00:42:26.507]  You know, you talked over a year ago about how he was cracking his knuckles in the ear of Obama, then it came out in the New York Times, how he calls up and threatens members of Congress.
[00:42:26.928 --> 00:42:30.653]  They're not going along with that, and it's on drugs today that they're sick of his bullying.
[00:42:32.881 --> 00:42:33.942]  Wayne Madsen's our guest.
[00:42:33.962 --> 00:42:35.222]  Your call's coming up the next hour.
[00:42:35.282 --> 00:42:36.203]  Big news blitz.
[00:42:36.263 --> 00:42:38.024]  I haven't even gotten to half the news yet.
[00:42:38.824 --> 00:42:49.870]  Drudge Report is linked in red, one of their top stories, to the report that it's confirmed they are recording the naked bodies of people, printing them out, laughing at people at the airports.
[00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:52.531]  It happened to a major TV film star.
[00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:55.412]  That's on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:42:55.813 --> 00:42:58.134]  And we have the new free iPhone app.

[00:43:00.515 --> 00:43:01.296]  We're good to go.
[00:43:19.735 --> 00:43:20.135]  I think so.
[00:43:42.858 --> 00:43:45.679]  With an unlimited shelf life you can store it anywhere.
[00:43:45.939 --> 00:43:51.002]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org.

[00:44:01.306 --> 00:44:04.968]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:05.328 --> 00:44:08.349]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:09.990]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:44:10.875 --> 00:44:13.316]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:13.336 --> 00:44:19.598]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:19.738 --> 00:44:24.780]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:34.903]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:35.023 --> 00:44:37.144]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:37.384 --> 00:44:38.705]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:38.965 --> 00:44:41.246]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:41.426 --> 00:44:43.267]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:48.310]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:53.472]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:44:59.713 --> 00:45:02.894]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:45:03.254 --> 00:45:05.094]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:45:05.554 --> 00:45:05.974]  Don't!
[00:45:06.414 --> 00:45:09.455]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[00:45:33.461 --> 00:45:34.441]  Herb K. was right.
[00:45:34.641 --> 00:45:37.702]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:38.843]  What have you got to lose?
[00:45:39.183 --> 00:45:42.384]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.

[00:45:51.728 --> 00:45:55.831]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:55.851 --> 00:45:57.212]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:46:16.576 --> 00:46:18.717]  I've learned how the globalists operate.
[00:46:18.857 --> 00:46:27.459]  For 16 years, 14 on air, I have done nothing but pore over their operations, studying them, reading their own declassified manuals.
[00:46:28.279 --> 00:46:35.561]  Clearly, I have no doubt in my mind, just like I did before 9-11, they are preparing to launch massive terror attacks in this country.
[00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:43.963]  I've been saying it the last three months, before the underwear bomber, before two weeks ago announcing we will be hit the next three to six months by the Pentagon and by the FBI.
[00:46:45.626 --> 00:46:58.598]  And Obama, I should have covered this as the top story today, it's the top of drudge, is saying in the Associated Press, if you criticize him, you're going to allow Al Qaeda to attack.
[00:46:58.678 --> 00:47:03.102]  In 2003, during the election, Cheney told U.S.
[00:47:03.142 --> 00:47:11.529]  News & World Report in a print interview, and he went on Meet the Press and said, if you get in the way of what we're doing and criticize us and investigate us for torture or for this war,
[00:47:12.685 --> 00:47:16.146]  You are going to allow a nuke to go off, and he smiled.
[00:47:17.226 --> 00:47:20.087]  Now, clearly, the neocons are running the show.
[00:47:20.487 --> 00:47:21.707]  There's no doubt of that now.
[00:47:21.947 --> 00:47:23.567]  Their foil, Obama, is exposed.
[00:47:23.928 --> 00:47:37.030]  Wayne Madsen, do you agree with me that the only card they've got, I even use the term card, is fake terror and wars, and now they're saying, play the war card, knowing if they really attack Iran, we won't have to sit around waiting for fake terror attacks.
[00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:39.211]  Iran is going to go absolutely ape.
[00:47:40.239 --> 00:47:42.280]  Well, we'll see that if they do.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:50.422]  I noticed that one of the things being pushed now is for Russia to withdraw its engineers from the Bushehr nuclear power plant on the Gulf.
[00:47:50.502 --> 00:47:52.242]  It's being constructed now.
[00:47:53.442 --> 00:47:56.743]  That would be the green light for an attack on that power plant.
[00:47:56.923 --> 00:48:04.345]  Right now, they won't attack it because a lot of Russians will die and that will create a... But they blew up Serb posts with Russians in them.
[00:48:04.705 --> 00:48:06.986]  They attacked South Ossetia with Russians.
[00:48:07.506 --> 00:48:09.308]  Oh, sure, and that's all part of it.
[00:48:09.688 --> 00:48:19.336]  Now that we see a friendlier government to Russia and Ukraine, what I think is going to happen, we're going to see Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey.
[00:48:19.476 --> 00:48:23.159]  And Turkey, of course, has had it with the neocons as well.
[00:48:23.179 --> 00:48:29.724]  And that gets into what Sabel Edmonds said a long time ago about the Turkish, excuse me, the Turkish deep state.
[00:48:29.804 --> 00:48:33.067]  Now we know there's a group called Organikon that's been active in Turkey for
[00:48:33.746 --> 00:48:45.554]  For decades, an old gladio behind-the-scenes underground movement that has been linked to Israeli intelligence, and they find out that a lot of Turkish generals have been involved in this.
[00:48:45.674 --> 00:48:54.740]  And one of the things they've tried to do is overthrow the government of Prime Minister Erdogan, who basically has taken Turkey on a much more independent path.
[00:48:56.001 --> 00:49:07.050]  But I would say that with Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, the regime in Georgia, the Saakashvili regime that was put in there with Soros' money, their days may be numbered.
[00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:12.895]  So we may be seeing another outbreak of hostilities in the Caucasus very soon.
[00:49:12.935 --> 00:49:13.936]  It may not be Iran.
[00:49:13.996 --> 00:49:15.517]  It may spill over to Tehran.
[00:49:15.557 --> 00:49:18.540]  But we may see something happen in the Caucasus first.
[00:49:21.963 --> 00:49:24.605]  So what's the word in D.C., Wayne, with all your contacts?
[00:49:24.665 --> 00:49:30.109]  I mean, are they mulling attacking Iran or going with these crippling sanctions, as Israel has called them?
[00:49:30.169 --> 00:49:31.570]  I mean, what's the 50-50?
[00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:32.071]  60-40?
[00:49:32.551 --> 00:49:34.733]  I mean, are they going to hit Iran and win?
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.481]  Well, I think they've always wanted to hit Iran.
[00:49:37.521 --> 00:49:44.544]  I've been writing about contingency plans that have gone hot on occasion during Bush, and now under Obama.
[00:49:44.624 --> 00:49:49.347]  That is the neocon wet dream, really.
[00:49:49.747 --> 00:49:50.928]  That's what they want to do.
[00:49:51.048 --> 00:49:57.071]  And I think they will stop at nothing to seek a military confrontation with Iran.
[00:49:57.111 --> 00:49:58.311]  And Iran knows it.
[00:49:58.371 --> 00:49:59.652]  I mean, yes, there are some
[00:50:00.072 --> 00:50:12.227]  Terrible ideologues in the Iranian government, but we have to realize that there was Western involvement in that Green Revolution, yet another themed revolution a la George Soros.
[00:50:12.828 --> 00:50:19.175]  And I think we're going to see a lot of blowback from that involvement by the West.
[00:50:20.436 --> 00:50:21.417]  Stay there, my friend.
[00:50:21.457 --> 00:50:28.821]  We're going to come back and talk to you for five more minutes, then calls and all the different important news is coming up right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:29.742]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:50:51.516 --> 00:50:55.139]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:50:55.479 --> 00:51:03.606]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:51:04.346 --> 00:51:08.389]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:19.799]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:51:20.419 --> 00:51:29.424]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:51:29.925 --> 00:51:34.988]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:51:35.368 --> 00:51:42.552]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:51:42.852 --> 00:51:45.254]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:51:52.805 --> 00:51:54.729]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:57.955]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:05.148 --> 00:52:09.411]  All right, final questions for Wayne Madsen of waynemadsenreport.com.
[00:52:09.431 --> 00:52:11.213]  Check it out today.
[00:52:11.293 --> 00:52:13.354]  Wayne, I know you're working on this story.
[00:52:13.734 --> 00:52:24.122]  The G20, they openly announced world government a few months ago, but I saw the Australian newspapers all reported, headline, secret banker meeting in Australia.
[00:52:24.643 --> 00:52:25.984]  The heads of the central banks
[00:52:26.904 --> 00:52:27.705]  24 total.
[00:52:28.787 --> 00:52:30.309]  What are they meeting about?
[00:52:30.369 --> 00:52:34.234]  How does this tie into China and their military saying dump U.S.
[00:52:34.274 --> 00:52:34.734]  bonds?
[00:52:35.115 --> 00:52:36.417]  Why is China saying this?
[00:52:36.477 --> 00:52:38.079]  What's really going on in this secret meeting?
[00:52:38.976 --> 00:52:42.138]  Well, you know, they're secret meetings, so we don't really know.
[00:52:42.198 --> 00:52:50.182]  We can postulate all we want to, but the fact is that these bankers have these secret conclaves.
[00:52:50.202 --> 00:52:56.145]  I understand Geithner went to another meeting up in Nunavut, which is the Canadian Arctic Territory.
[00:52:56.165 --> 00:52:59.627]  It's one of the most remote places on the planet.
[00:52:59.727 --> 00:53:02.149]  And what in the world was going on up there?
[00:53:02.209 --> 00:53:04.170]  What was going on with this meeting in Australia?
[00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.071]  Of course, they just had the meeting in Davos.
[00:53:06.952 --> 00:53:12.117]  Where the head of security was found dead in a hotel room next to the Congress Center.
[00:53:12.557 --> 00:53:18.223]  I mean, this is stuff like out of a Dan Brown novel.
[00:53:18.843 --> 00:53:20.705]  You can't make this kind of stuff up.
[00:53:21.586 --> 00:53:27.152]  But I do know that the people at the Federal Reserve are quite proud of the fact that they meet in secret.
[00:53:27.592 --> 00:53:32.635]  They call that place the Temple, and no information leaves the Temple.
[00:53:33.136 --> 00:53:37.639]  And all this idea of more transparency, I think, is just a bunch of hogwash.
[00:53:38.099 --> 00:53:38.960]  They're trying to do it.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:48.166]  There's a big PR campaign because they know that they're under the gun, and there's more people talking about the Fed now than ever in the past, and they're trying to do damage control.
[00:53:48.246 --> 00:53:55.531]  But the fact that these bankers meet in secret, I think, speaks loudly to what their agenda is.
[00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:57.112]  They've got a secret agenda.
[00:53:58.833 --> 00:54:00.094]  Well, there's no doubt about that.
[00:54:00.134 --> 00:54:09.120]  I mean, we've gone from the public not even knowing that the Federal Reserve was private to some polls as high as 91% that want to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[00:54:09.521 --> 00:54:16.866]  I think the bottom line here is more and more the elites are cornered and this private corporate structure that's captured the U.S.
[00:54:16.906 --> 00:54:21.689]  and used it as a vehicle of tyranny is in a lot of trouble, but they're going to play the war card.
[00:54:21.709 --> 00:54:23.951]  They're going to play the staged terror attack card.
[00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:26.333]  Wayne, when do you think they're going to play the card?
[00:54:27.403 --> 00:54:35.431]  You know, it's hard to say when they're going to do that, but right now Washington has had well over two feet of snow.
[00:54:35.471 --> 00:54:38.874]  We may have another foot or more coming tonight.
[00:54:39.895 --> 00:54:42.518]  You can see how this town just grinds to a halt.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:45.941]  We're good to go.
[00:55:02.891 --> 00:55:16.094]  That's the weather, but if it was a terror attack, either in Washington or some other major city, of course, they could play that card, as you said, and try to ram a bunch more legislation through.
[00:55:19.894 --> 00:55:28.176]  Will they pull the terror card first before they go into Iran, or will they hit Iran, and then Iran will actually fight back, and that'll be called terrorism?
[00:55:29.013 --> 00:55:31.475]  It's hard to say what their contingency is for this.
[00:55:31.515 --> 00:55:36.680]  Of course, Iran, the worst-case scenario is Iran will bottle up the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:43.146]  They'll sink a couple of supertankers and hit the refineries in Saudi Arabia.
[00:55:43.166 --> 00:55:54.497]  And if that happens, of course, if you think gas prices are pretty high now, wait till they jump up to, you know, could be $7, $8 to $10 a gallon, and that's what we'll see.
[00:55:55.517 --> 00:55:56.158]  Last question.
[00:55:56.258 --> 00:55:58.679]  Why is China getting so mad at the U.S.?
[00:55:58.699 --> 00:56:00.259]  I mean, we've shipped all our industry there.
[00:56:01.259 --> 00:56:04.341]  We're letting them not have the carbon taxes when we're going to have them.
[00:56:05.681 --> 00:56:07.302]  Why is China threatening the U.S.
[00:56:07.322 --> 00:56:07.942]  so much right now?
[00:56:08.717 --> 00:56:10.578]  Well, I think they've found U.S.
[00:56:10.659 --> 00:56:16.803]  intelligence fingerprints on the riots in Xinjiang province, in the Uyghur region.
[00:56:16.943 --> 00:56:25.410]  Of course, Soros was known to have been involved in the Tibetan uprising, and of course, the selling of weapons to Taiwan.
[00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:28.793]  These are all, you know, China considers, and we recognize
[00:56:29.233 --> 00:56:35.078]  Taiwan is part of China, and this is just like tweaking the nose of the dragon.
[00:56:35.098 --> 00:56:40.242]  Remember during the Cold War, they said we tweaked the nose of the Russian bear.
[00:56:40.322 --> 00:56:47.668]  Now we're tweaking the nose of the Chinese dragon, and I think it's all this power politics to return to the old days of some neo-Cold War.
[00:56:48.954 --> 00:56:53.224]  I agree, they're saying they've kicked it back off, and of course the real target's us, the American people.
[00:56:53.244 --> 00:56:57.753]  But the globalists know we'll tend to go along with their tyranny if they're menacing us with outside threats.
[00:56:57.774 --> 00:56:58.956]  Dwayne Madsen, thank you.
[00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:04.640]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.004]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:57:08.244 --> 00:57:13.029]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:57:13.049 --> 00:57:19.316]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:21.679]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:57:22.199 --> 00:57:22.499]  Tim Geithner?
[00:57:22.519 --> 00:57:22.940]  Bernanke?
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:23.640]  They're arsonists!
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:24.961]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:57:24.981 --> 00:57:27.223]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:57:41.112 --> 00:57:42.954]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:57:43.234 --> 00:57:48.078]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:58:05.021 --> 00:58:07.745]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:58:07.785 --> 00:58:12.151]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:58:14.514 --> 00:58:17.555]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:59:00.106 --> 00:59:04.409]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best-tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news!
[00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:07.291]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[00:59:07.471 --> 00:59:09.873]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[00:59:10.093 --> 00:59:16.958]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad-spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[00:59:17.139 --> 00:59:18.259]  What does this mean in the garden?
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:23.003]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength.
[00:59:23.183 --> 00:59:29.630]  Blue Ribbon Garden Produce, jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bridge wheatgrass.
[00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:32.753]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[00:59:32.893 --> 00:59:35.496]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[00:59:35.716 --> 00:59:42.704]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[00:59:42.984 --> 00:59:47.648]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might just be the ultimate hard times barter item.

[00:59:53.974 --> 00:59:54.014]  877-327-0365.
[00:59:54.034 --> 00:59:55.075]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:59:55.095 --> 00:59:56.556]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:20.411]  Here's the Washington Post and ABC News.
[01:00:20.431 --> 01:00:21.352]  This is coming up.
[01:00:23.374 --> 01:00:25.816]  Some critics serving the goals of Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:26.176 --> 01:00:28.238]  Some critics serving the goals of Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:30.020]  Here's the ABC News headline.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:30.581]  Here's another one.
[01:00:30.601 --> 01:00:33.904]  Brennan, political fear-mongering serves the goals of Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:34.604 --> 01:00:38.228]  And it goes on to say, criticizing Obama aids Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:39.188 --> 01:00:41.591]  And Governor Ridge admits, the former head of Homeland Security,
[01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:45.483]  That this was all issued for political gain.
[01:00:45.523 --> 01:00:46.704]  The fake terror alerts.
[01:00:47.365 --> 01:00:50.848]  And they're now playing the exact same card again.
[01:00:51.729 --> 01:00:54.431]  Here's a Politico.com article poll.
[01:00:54.491 --> 01:00:56.833]  Deborah Medina closing in on Hutchinson.
[01:00:57.934 --> 01:00:59.495]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is exciting.
[01:01:02.139 --> 01:01:05.481]  Sarah Palin would have endorsed her, she would have won for sure, but she's still got a chance.
[01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:13.765]  Thursday we've got Richard Reeves in here in studio with us to talk about this and a whole host of other issues with what we're fighting with the New World Order.
[01:01:14.565 --> 01:01:21.528]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go back to your calls quickly because I want to get back in the news and then more calls coming up.
[01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:24.250]  Plus I've made a special video that's going to premiere here.
[01:01:25.865 --> 01:01:32.467]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, and then we're going to post it up on YouTube, where I break down what's happening with the Tea Parties.
[01:01:32.487 --> 01:01:37.929]  And we're getting comments, and I'm going to use this idea the listener just gave us, in the Twitter account.
[01:01:38.949 --> 01:01:46.432]  We're not going to go along with Sarah Palin's attempt to take over the Tea Parties.
[01:01:47.799 --> 01:01:54.020]  And we do need to start having coffee parties to wake up the Tea Party people from the neocon fraud.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.141]  That's a great idea.
[01:01:55.561 --> 01:01:56.561]  So you heard it here first.
[01:01:57.141 --> 01:01:57.961]  The coffee parties.
[01:01:58.001 --> 01:01:58.841]  Great idea, listeners.
[01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:00.522]  Step in, Texas.
[01:02:00.562 --> 01:02:01.622]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:02:03.262 --> 01:02:05.803]  Sure, you've had a great show over the last three, four weeks.
[01:02:05.863 --> 01:02:07.203]  Just mind-blowing stuff.
[01:02:07.863 --> 01:02:10.964]  I wanted to talk about two things I would love if you would ask.
[01:02:11.774 --> 01:02:40.969]  Mr. Mattson about this, he would be perfect to answer this, and that is two events that have occurred in our world's history that I feel are very important to where we are now, which is first the House of Rothschild in Britain, in France, convincing the Confederacy to rise up and then having that loss, and then the House of Rothschild convincing the Germans to go with the Nazis to rise up, and they had the same fate.
[01:02:41.434 --> 01:02:52.918]  Both of these events are critical to our world for the simple reason that when the Confederacy, you know, rised up, we went into a national state of emergency.
[01:02:53.198 --> 01:02:56.300]  We've never left that national state of emergency.
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.880]  If you read the U.S.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.442]  Senate Report 93549, which was done in 1973, it says we are still under national state of emergency.
[01:03:08.746 --> 01:03:10.808]  And that's why these executive orders can operate.
[01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:27.773]  Yes, I'm so sick of, quote, freedom people thinking you're free.
[01:03:28.134 --> 01:03:30.955]  You know, get your head out of the sand.
[01:03:30.995 --> 01:03:33.977]  We've been a serf since 1860.
[01:03:34.097 --> 01:03:34.737]  Exactly.
[01:03:34.857 --> 01:03:37.619]  And Palin and Obama, it's all a distraction.
[01:03:37.639 --> 01:03:41.741]  The offshore banks illegitimately running our country is the only issue.
[01:03:41.821 --> 01:03:42.481]  Thank you, Step.
[01:03:42.501 --> 01:03:46.963]  And that's why we need to found coffee parties to wake up the tea parties.
[01:03:47.203 --> 01:03:48.064]  What a great idea.
[01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.505]  Curtis in Canada.
[01:03:50.336 --> 01:03:51.416]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:03:51.936 --> 01:03:54.257]  Hey, I just wanted to talk about the internet for a second.
[01:03:55.217 --> 01:03:59.018]  I know all this, this is all in the news now about the internet getting shut down.
[01:03:59.038 --> 01:04:15.841]  Were you aware of this Department of Defense, it was the DARPA Network Challenge, where they had like ten weather balloons scattered all across the United States, and it took the team from MIT about nine hours to find them all, just using
[01:04:17.884 --> 01:04:20.525]  Just using the internet and social networks and whatnot?
[01:04:22.165 --> 01:04:22.506]  Yes.
[01:04:23.346 --> 01:04:24.466]  Yeah?
[01:04:24.846 --> 01:04:28.888]  Isn't it kind of strange that, like, it's the Department of Defense that's doing this?
[01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:40.412]  I agree that we need to stop this second internet from coming in, but I mean, if all else fails, like, can't we just start hoarding data and
[01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:49.973]  You know, books, manuals, gardening books, schematics on how to build generators, solar panels... Yes, Curtis, Curtis, Curtis.
[01:04:50.373 --> 01:04:51.734]  Absolutely, I agree with your call.
[01:04:52.074 --> 01:04:52.754]  Let me comment on this.
[01:04:52.814 --> 01:04:53.694]  It's a very important issue.
[01:04:56.855 --> 01:05:01.156]  Right now, with the Internet open and free, we are exponentially growing.
[01:05:01.236 --> 01:05:02.457]  I mean, look at my website.
[01:05:02.477 --> 01:05:04.157]  You look at our radio listeners online.
[01:05:04.397 --> 01:05:05.537]  We're on AM and FM as well.
[01:05:06.358 --> 01:05:07.678]  If you look at every level,
[01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.616]  Our numbers are exploding and I'm just one benchmark.
[01:05:13.016 --> 01:05:13.556]  One gauge.
[01:05:14.457 --> 01:05:30.061]  I can be in Montana, California, New York, Florida, Central America, Canada, England, and before it'd be like one out of twenty people that walked past me would stop and say, Alex Jones, I'm a fan.
[01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:31.722]  Now it's like half of them.
[01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:37.443]  And again, that's a gauge of how many people we've woken up.
[01:05:37.543 --> 01:05:38.624]  I'm just Alex Jones.
[01:05:39.471 --> 01:05:46.693]  Sure, we're the biggest thing in the awakening, the biggest thing in the liberty movement worldwide against the globalists, but we're small in the overall aggregate.
[01:05:48.399 --> 01:05:52.342]  And so we want to fight and keep the web free and open.
[01:05:52.403 --> 01:05:53.584]  It isn't a new Internet.
[01:05:53.904 --> 01:05:56.806]  It's a stunted, controlled Internet, is what Internet 2 is.
[01:05:57.407 --> 01:05:59.048]  We've been warning about it now for six, seven years.
[01:05:59.749 --> 01:06:01.891]  And now it's all coming true, because we're reading their own manuals.
[01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:04.573]  It's not like I'm predicting this, that they say what they're going to do.
[01:06:04.953 --> 01:06:06.755]  Now they're out in the open, which means they're moving.
[01:06:07.135 --> 01:06:08.296]  They're getting ready for a new war.
[01:06:08.777 --> 01:06:10.478]  That's when they'll launch this Internet control.
[01:06:10.678 --> 01:06:12.780]  They'll launch fake attacks on themselves and shut it down.
[01:06:13.701 --> 01:06:15.843]  So I've always said, have a dual operation.
[01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:20.271]  You know, don't just have one website, have two if you're an average person.
[01:06:20.311 --> 01:06:22.012]  We have like 20 or so, or more.
[01:06:23.173 --> 01:06:34.217]  Don't just... I don't just have a radio show, I make films, I make other videos, I write books, I publish books, I make other... I produce other videos, I support other people, I have other activists on.
[01:06:34.878 --> 01:06:39.580]  I do banner hang contests to show you the power of that and it becomes international sensation.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.101]  We're illustrating your power.
[01:06:43.146 --> 01:06:52.631]  And so, you're on the internet, you fight for the internet, but you also, at the grassroots, hoard the info as a backup to give to people.
[01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:57.494]  And the most effective thing is not just some internet, it's to make copies of my films and give them to people.
[01:06:57.534 --> 01:06:59.235]  The power of that is seismic.
[01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:02.864]  I mean, it's just unbelievably big.
[01:07:03.264 --> 01:07:04.744]  And so you attack on all fronts.
[01:07:05.004 --> 01:07:06.985]  They're shutting access TV down around the country.
[01:07:07.005 --> 01:07:08.325]  They've shut down close to half of them.
[01:07:08.845 --> 01:07:10.266]  Use the others that are still there.
[01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.026]  Defend them.
[01:07:11.086 --> 01:07:11.686]  Support them.
[01:07:11.726 --> 01:07:12.586]  Go to city council.
[01:07:12.926 --> 01:07:13.886]  Go to county commissioners.
[01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:14.847]  Put my films on.
[01:07:14.887 --> 01:07:15.667]  Do your own show.
[01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:18.488]  Again, it's all a concern.
[01:07:18.508 --> 01:07:19.648]  Call into talk radio.
[01:07:19.728 --> 01:07:20.608]  Letters to the editor.
[01:07:21.548 --> 01:07:25.149]  Call local TV and newspapers and tell them what you'd like to see them report on.
[01:07:25.169 --> 01:07:27.390]  A lot of these reporters aren't bad, they're just ignorant.
[01:07:28.322 --> 01:07:34.226]  There's an awakening happening, and as more people wake up, the more people are speaking out, the harder it is for the globalists to censor.
[01:07:34.446 --> 01:07:46.955]  And if they come in and try to censor the web, as they're doing now, and we scream bloody murder and get the word out, and point out this is happening, it'll blow up in their face, our information will get even more readers and viewers, and it'll be harder for them to try it again.
[01:07:47.915 --> 01:07:48.536]  You fight.
[01:07:48.896 --> 01:07:49.657]  You resist.
[01:07:49.777 --> 01:07:51.338]  Resistance is victory.
[01:07:51.638 --> 01:07:52.799]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[01:07:53.139 --> 01:07:55.120]  Let's talk to Chris in Georgia.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:55.681]  You're on the air.
[01:07:57.378 --> 01:07:57.978]  Hey Alex.
[01:07:58.939 --> 01:08:02.161]  Happy birthday, buddy.
[01:08:02.421 --> 01:08:03.001]  You're right.
[01:08:03.301 --> 01:08:06.343]  I really enjoyed your conversation with Wayne Madsen.
[01:08:06.643 --> 01:08:14.567]  When he got into the quadrillions of derivatives, that's something that I think is very underestimated, under-talked about.
[01:08:14.587 --> 01:08:17.368]  That's the globalist power.
[01:08:17.448 --> 01:08:18.329]  That's where they get their power.
[01:08:18.909 --> 01:08:25.092]  Well, it's a power in numbers in that they've got everybody in such Goldman Sachs and some of the other banks.
[01:08:25.332 --> 01:08:28.873]  People will kill for $100 and the globalists just make it out of nothing.
[01:08:29.374 --> 01:08:31.715]  Well, and then, you know, it's out of control.
[01:08:31.735 --> 01:08:39.178]  I think the speed and the processing, everything is coming so fast and so furious that no one can control it with the information age, etc.
[01:08:40.295 --> 01:08:41.216]  It's just getting worse.
[01:08:41.236 --> 01:08:44.021]  I mean, you talk about them taking over our 401ks.
[01:08:44.362 --> 01:08:46.445]  You all mentioned the money market issues.
[01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:52.235]  More than 10 states have remote control thermostats to control your thermostats.
[01:08:53.226 --> 01:08:54.728]  Well, I mean, the money market issues.
[01:08:54.768 --> 01:09:02.554]  I mean, it's the safest investment in the world, and now if I've got $100,000 in the bank and I want to go down and get it out, they can say, no, you can't have your money.
[01:09:02.575 --> 01:09:04.496]  I mean, that's a load of poo right there.
[01:09:04.897 --> 01:09:06.158]  You know, the South Carolina thing.
[01:09:06.198 --> 01:09:10.321]  But the bottom line is, do you have any sort of emergency thing?
[01:09:10.401 --> 01:09:13.184]  You do all this wonderful stuff, and you have 20 websites, whatever.
[01:09:13.684 --> 01:09:17.528]  Is there some dedicated shortwave radio, you know,
[01:09:18.365 --> 01:09:20.991]  That we can all go to when they finally do take it away.
[01:09:21.292 --> 01:09:23.196]  I mean, is there some plan that we have?
[01:09:23.216 --> 01:09:24.078]  Yes, we have a plan!
[01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:27.868]  We have phone backup to WWCR.
[01:09:27.908 --> 01:09:31.731]  They carry four hours during the day live, and four hours 9 p.m.
[01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:32.351]  to 1 a.m.
[01:09:32.552 --> 01:09:32.952]  Central.
[01:09:33.692 --> 01:09:34.433]  So 11 a.m.
[01:09:34.453 --> 01:09:35.073]  to 3 p.m.
[01:09:35.134 --> 01:09:37.495]  Central is live on WWCR.
[01:09:37.636 --> 01:09:38.917]  Best shortwave outlet out there.
[01:09:38.937 --> 01:09:40.418]  100,000 smoking watts.
[01:09:40.938 --> 01:09:42.980]  And then they re-air us 9 to 1 a.m.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.402]  And so, yes, we will.
[01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:54.549]  If they shut us off the internet, we're going to still... We have phone backups and other backups to our stations, to shortwave, and we're going to try.
[01:09:55.803 --> 01:09:59.286]  Well, if they do shut it down, we need some way to keep it going.
[01:09:59.306 --> 01:10:05.753]  We need some way for at least the dedicated listeners to be able to tune in and keep getting the word out one way or another.
[01:10:05.773 --> 01:10:06.653]  And that's up to listeners.
[01:10:06.733 --> 01:10:08.195]  We've got those backup systems.
[01:10:08.215 --> 01:10:13.980]  We've got a system where how many people can call free and listen over the phone?
[01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:16.622]  I mean, it's not an iPhone thing.
[01:10:16.662 --> 01:10:17.843]  It's an analog phone line.
[01:10:18.323 --> 01:10:19.123]  How many people can listen?
[01:10:19.143 --> 01:10:19.904]  We have two systems.
[01:10:20.044 --> 01:10:23.606]  One is a volunteer who does it out of Michigan.
[01:10:24.146 --> 01:10:27.148]  And the other, we pay for it $2,500 a month.
[01:10:27.468 --> 01:10:28.509]  Callablow is the sponsor.
[01:10:29.469 --> 01:10:30.690]  But it costs $2,500.
[01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.191]  Ask one of the IT guys.
[01:10:32.231 --> 01:10:34.092]  I think it's... How many?
[01:10:36.715 --> 01:10:48.264]  Yeah, I think it's... But again, then we'd have to go to a subscription service and we were going to have 100,000 people listening on the phone lines because we couldn't pay for it, but right now I know it's thousands every day.
[01:10:49.104 --> 01:10:51.867]  We try to put these different backup systems in.
[01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:59.672]  No, it is not 5,000 people that can listen over the phone system.
[01:10:59.692 --> 01:11:01.094]  You'll have to ask one of the IT guys.
[01:11:01.934 --> 01:11:04.196]  Okay, I hope that answers your question, sir.
[01:11:04.556 --> 01:11:05.237]  Is that it, Chris?
[01:11:06.099 --> 01:11:08.601]  Yeah, that's pretty much it, but thank you very much and have a great birthday.
[01:11:09.322 --> 01:11:10.142]  Thank you so much.
[01:11:10.663 --> 01:11:13.845]  I want to say it's 500 callers, but I'm going from memory here.
[01:11:14.686 --> 01:11:15.827]  Again, it takes money.
[01:11:16.187 --> 01:11:19.970]  We want to give you 500 free phone lines, $2,500 a month.
[01:11:20.811 --> 01:11:25.454]  And I've done three, four days of radio without even plugging sponsors.
[01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:30.058]  And what happens is they get their money refunded because I'm so focused on news.
[01:11:30.638 --> 01:11:31.319]  And information.
[01:11:31.419 --> 01:11:32.379]  You want to support us?
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:33.540]  Buy the books.
[01:11:33.761 --> 01:11:34.601]  Buy the DVDs.
[01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:36.703]  Buy the material off InfoWars.com.
[01:11:37.103 --> 01:11:41.367]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership so we can build up our robust system.
[01:11:41.667 --> 01:11:44.850]  If I had the money right now, I'd already start this newspaper nationwide.
[01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:47.512]  And you think, well, newspapers are going out.
[01:11:47.532 --> 01:11:48.272]  No, they're not.
[01:11:48.292 --> 01:11:50.174]  Not newspapers with real news.
[01:11:51.235 --> 01:11:52.536]  But it's going to be a free newspaper.
[01:11:52.756 --> 01:11:54.737]  The advertising, though, is what will pay for it.
[01:11:56.099 --> 01:11:57.900]  But it's the startup capital to do that.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.761]  We'll be right back.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.441]  Men, are you thinking about the health of your prostate?
[01:12:02.661 --> 01:12:08.182]  Recently, New Vitality Health Products gave away thousands of free bottles of the supplement Beta Prostate.
[01:12:08.382 --> 01:12:14.303]  Due to incredible demand, they're giving away more free bottles of Beta Prostate to any new customers who call now.
[01:12:14.483 --> 01:12:18.164]  Beta Prostate is packed with plant sterols that support your prostate health.
[01:12:18.384 --> 01:12:20.505]  Remember, your prostate affects urine flow.
[01:12:20.765 --> 01:12:23.969]  Sleeping habits, intimacy and overall quality of life.
[01:12:24.209 --> 01:12:32.639]  Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 saw palm metal capsules in order to get the same natural plant sterols as one Beta Prostate.
[01:12:32.759 --> 01:12:37.124]  And if you haven't tried Beta Prostate yet, you can call right now for a free bottle.
[01:12:37.284 --> 01:12:38.765]  You only pay shipping and handling.
[01:12:38.926 --> 01:12:39.246]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[01:12:41.969 --> 01:12:44.973]  This offer is limited to one free bottle per household.
[01:12:45.133 --> 01:12:47.475]  Give your body nutrition that targets the prostate.
[01:12:47.576 --> 01:12:50.058]  Call now and try Beta Prostate for free.
[01:12:50.098 --> 01:12:50.419]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[01:12:50.439 --> 01:12:50.699]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[01:12:50.719 --> 01:12:50.779]  1-800-360-8306.
[01:13:00.365 --> 01:13:01.206]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:13:01.406 --> 01:13:06.750]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:07.350]  I get it.
[01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:16.817]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:13:17.097 --> 01:13:18.298]  That's not what's happening.
[01:13:18.518 --> 01:13:22.881]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:13:23.081 --> 01:13:24.782]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[01:13:24.923 --> 01:13:26.764]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[01:13:26.964 --> 01:13:30.247]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:13:30.367 --> 01:13:34.450]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:36.211]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:39.474]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:13:40.195 --> 01:13:43.817]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:13:44.018 --> 01:13:44.738]  You should, too.
[01:13:44.918 --> 01:13:45.899]  Find out what they know.
[01:13:46.079 --> 01:13:49.322]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:13:49.582 --> 01:13:49.622]  800-686-2237.
[01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:49.682]  800-686-2237.
[01:13:49.702 --> 01:13:49.882]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:13:49.902 --> 01:13:52.483]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:52.503 --> 01:13:53.984]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:54.104 --> 01:13:55.664]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:13.113]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:14:13.133 --> 01:14:19.399]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:24.563]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:34.713]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:14:34.813 --> 01:14:36.935]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:14:37.175 --> 01:14:38.497]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:14:38.757 --> 01:14:41.099]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:14:41.219 --> 01:14:43.061]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:14:43.341 --> 01:14:48.146]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:14:48.506 --> 01:14:53.271]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:14:53.511 --> 01:14:57.855]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:59.656 --> 01:15:05.020]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.142]  Do you care as much about your air and water?
[01:15:07.422 --> 01:15:11.025]  Lock out harmful poisons from entering your body with airandaqua.com.

[01:15:29.159 --> 01:15:38.445]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:15:38.485 --> 01:15:45.430]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:46.391]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:15:46.431 --> 01:15:49.533]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:15:49.693 --> 01:15:50.453]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:15:50.473 --> 01:15:51.534]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:15:51.554 --> 01:15:51.834]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:15:51.874 --> 01:15:52.234]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:15:59.039 --> 01:16:03.282]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[01:16:03.342 --> 01:16:04.282]  How are you doing?
[01:16:25.485 --> 01:16:27.366]  Well, I live in Whistler, British Columbia here.
[01:16:27.406 --> 01:16:31.228]  It's home to some of the events for the Olympics coming up here this week.
[01:16:31.248 --> 01:16:37.711]  Kind of a reference to the article from deprogrammed.net.
[01:16:37.991 --> 01:16:41.953]  We've got two tons of missing ammonium nitrate from Vancouver.
[01:16:43.296 --> 01:16:47.117]  All this talk about false flag attacks, yadda yadda yadda.
[01:16:47.617 --> 01:16:48.577]  And they say the U.S.
[01:16:48.657 --> 01:16:50.417]  Army will be used in Canada.
[01:16:50.837 --> 01:16:53.098]  That's in the Toronto newspaper.
[01:16:53.518 --> 01:16:54.838]  That they're going to use U.S.
[01:16:55.018 --> 01:16:56.018]  Army in Canada.
[01:16:56.318 --> 01:16:57.799]  So talk about North American Union.
[01:16:57.819 --> 01:17:01.379]  Yes, I think the Olympics are a prime target of the Globalist to Stage Terror.
[01:17:01.719 --> 01:17:05.900]  The problem is citizens and police that are awake are now watching for this.
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:10.501]  Just three weeks ago they caught a clear false flag in New Jersey with this army guy
[01:17:11.221 --> 01:17:13.602]  Dressed up like a Muslim running around with rocket launchers.
[01:17:14.443 --> 01:17:15.403]  That's crazy.
[01:17:15.503 --> 01:17:17.204]  He had like a fake beard and turban.
[01:17:18.265 --> 01:17:21.747]  Yeah, I mean, I just think, again, Whistler, we have two high-profile kind of targets.
[01:17:21.767 --> 01:17:33.093]  We've got one of the largest stores of ammonium gas cooling our bobsled track, and we also have a massive hydrogen storage facility to run our new green buses.
[01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:38.424]  Well, I'm sure the globalists have already picked their targets, but if we expose them, they won't be able to carry it out.
[01:17:38.464 --> 01:17:42.265]  But I agree, they've really been hype and terror at that event, so we need to be very watchful.
[01:17:42.285 --> 01:17:42.925]  Thank you, Eric.
[01:17:43.245 --> 01:17:44.825]  Jim in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:17:44.845 --> 01:17:48.546]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:17:48.606 --> 01:17:49.567]  Just two quick things.
[01:17:50.087 --> 01:17:57.869]  I'm calling about the new horrible bill from South Carolina about identifying subversives or whatever to the government.
[01:17:58.689 --> 01:18:03.850]  I think this is an amazing opportunity that we have to take an attack from these
[01:18:04.801 --> 01:18:15.227]  People turn around and shove it right back up into their guts because if that's the case, if they want to identify subversives, what's calling the lawyers of South Carolina to start doing that?
[01:18:15.587 --> 01:18:17.128]  Let's indict the Federal Reserve.
[01:18:17.168 --> 01:18:28.875]  Let's indict the public servants and businesses that are taking money from places like the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and any other types of organizations like that that have been
[01:18:29.761 --> 01:18:39.669]  You know, you mentioned in your film, let's indict them, bring them in front of a jury, and have them, you know, be identified as subverts to the government of the United States.
[01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:40.809]  You know, that's a great point.
[01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:42.250]  They all violate the Logan Act.
[01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:45.493]  They have secret banker meetings all over the world.
[01:18:45.573 --> 01:18:46.013]  I was just...
[01:18:47.054 --> 01:18:49.335]  Covering that earlier in the show.
[01:18:49.755 --> 01:18:52.516]  They are clearly outside globalist subversives.
[01:18:52.556 --> 01:18:54.616]  How about they're under the control of foreign powers?
[01:18:54.876 --> 01:18:56.197]  How about they register themselves?
[01:18:56.237 --> 01:18:57.097]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:57.557 --> 01:19:10.701]  The problem with this legislation they're trying to pass all over the country at the state level, federally proposed though, is, and I'm reading from the actual bill that passed in South Carolina, they got one in Virginia and other states,
[01:19:12.401 --> 01:19:21.023]  It actually says in here that every member of a subversive organization or organized organization subject to foreign control, comma, means a new thought.
[01:19:21.083 --> 01:19:22.743]  People are emailing me going, well it says foreign groups.
[01:19:23.023 --> 01:19:37.266]  Yeah, that and every foreign asset, every person who advocates, comma, teaches, comma, advises or practices the duty, the necessity or the proprietary, the propriety of controlling
[01:19:38.346 --> 01:19:47.871]  Comma, separate thought, conducting or seizing or overthrowing the government of the United States shall register with the Secretary of State or get 10 years in prison, $25,000 fine.
[01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:54.895]  Now, just like when I wrote the award-winning analysis of Patriot Act 1 and 2, I got the second place for the Project Censored Award.
[01:19:55.415 --> 01:19:57.336]  Lawyers had to go and read it themselves.
[01:19:57.496 --> 01:19:58.437]  I went and read the whole thing.
[01:19:59.699 --> 01:20:05.885]  It said section 802 that all actions that endanger human life in a violation of any federal or state law are acts of terrorism.
[01:20:06.546 --> 01:20:10.430]  And I said this will be used in misdemeanors and non-terror related.
[01:20:11.331 --> 01:20:12.212]  People didn't believe it.
[01:20:12.252 --> 01:20:13.573]  They said, oh, it doesn't mean that.
[01:20:13.874 --> 01:20:15.635]  You don't know how to read law.
[01:20:16.276 --> 01:20:16.676]  I do.
[01:20:16.837 --> 01:20:18.258]  You need to learn how out there.
[01:20:18.699 --> 01:20:20.641]  Anybody can learn this if you work hard.
[01:20:21.664 --> 01:20:32.271]  Now they admit, eight years later, the Patriot Act is used per state, thousands of times per state, every year, in marijuana, drugs, domestic violence, guns.
[01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:35.273]  It's used with teenagers that threaten their teacher.
[01:20:35.874 --> 01:20:37.575]  It's used with people with prank calls.
[01:20:37.715 --> 01:20:40.076]  Everybody knows they're using, in fact, Google it right now.
[01:20:40.517 --> 01:20:42.778]  Patriot Act used for non-terror.
[01:20:43.018 --> 01:20:45.740]  Patriot Act used for regular crime.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:51.144]  And you'll get thousands of AP Reuters telling you how good it is and how great it is.
[01:20:51.844 --> 01:20:53.305]  And people told me I was wrong.
[01:20:53.545 --> 01:20:56.187]  They told me my Homeland Security reports were wrong.
[01:20:56.647 --> 01:21:03.472]  We first started reporting literally the day it broke that the emails on ClimateGate were real.
[01:21:03.552 --> 01:21:04.832]  People didn't believe it for a week.
[01:21:05.953 --> 01:21:07.234]  It's over and over again.
[01:21:07.334 --> 01:21:09.295]  People buy into media hoaxes.
[01:21:09.795 --> 01:21:12.537]  But in the end, the truth comes out.
[01:21:13.338 --> 01:21:13.678]  Okay?
[01:21:14.258 --> 01:21:18.141]  The government puts out its hoaxes, but we tell the truth, and in the end it comes out.
[01:21:18.641 --> 01:21:25.623]  That's why they can run COINTELLOPS on me and make things up I've done and cut videos certain ways to make me look bad.
[01:21:26.003 --> 01:21:27.264]  It's deception, folks.
[01:21:27.364 --> 01:21:28.184]  It's deception.
[01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:31.645]  Because who, when you talk to people, woke the most people up?
[01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:32.565]  80% of the time.
[01:21:32.785 --> 01:21:34.866]  My films, my website, my radio show.
[01:21:35.166 --> 01:21:35.666]  We're it!
[01:21:36.026 --> 01:21:37.027]  We're the big kahuna.
[01:21:37.467 --> 01:21:38.147]  You understand that?
[01:21:38.167 --> 01:21:40.848]  We're the front-line flagship against the New World Order.
[01:21:41.768 --> 01:21:44.789]  And they don't want to crush us out in the open because it'll make us martyrs.
[01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:47.310]  So they run all their ops on us, but it's not working.
[01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.990]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:48.310]  Stay with us.
[01:21:50.259 --> 01:21:53.247]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:56.877]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.322 --> 01:22:02.923]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:03.323 --> 01:22:08.285]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:22:08.645 --> 01:22:10.385]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:22:10.706 --> 01:22:15.447]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:22:15.627 --> 01:22:16.588]  How much do you want?
[01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:17.568]  When do you want it?
[01:22:17.948 --> 01:22:19.529]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:22:19.829 --> 01:22:20.649]  When will you need it?
[01:22:20.889 --> 01:22:22.950]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:24.210]  Will there be any food?
[01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:25.771]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:22:25.971 --> 01:22:26.331]  If there's a
[01:22:26.391 --> 01:22:28.332]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:22:28.492 --> 01:22:31.033]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:34.414]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:22:34.814 --> 01:22:38.296]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:22:38.636 --> 01:22:39.616]  How much will you need?
[01:22:39.856 --> 01:22:40.477]  We don't know.
[01:22:40.757 --> 01:22:41.677]  How much do you want?
[01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:42.598]  All you can get.
[01:22:42.778 --> 01:22:43.478]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:43.878 --> 01:22:46.641]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:54.207]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:54.467 --> 01:22:58.350]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:23:01.613 --> 01:23:05.276]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:23:05.636 --> 01:23:08.638]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:08.879 --> 01:23:10.280]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:23:10.979 --> 01:23:13.640]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:19.901]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:20.041 --> 01:23:25.102]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:35.225]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:23:35.345 --> 01:23:37.446]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:37.686 --> 01:23:39.006]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:39.266 --> 01:23:41.547]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:23:41.727 --> 01:23:43.568]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:43.588 --> 01:23:48.630]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:53.772]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:23:54.012 --> 01:23:58.114]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:00.675 --> 01:24:01.255]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:24:01.575 --> 01:24:07.058]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:24:07.698 --> 01:24:13.481]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:24:14.181 --> 01:24:17.422]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:24:18.082 --> 01:24:21.304]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:24:21.984 --> 01:24:25.345]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[01:24:25.945 --> 01:24:30.466]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:24:31.186 --> 01:24:33.147]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:24:33.827 --> 01:24:37.168]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:24:37.828 --> 01:24:40.749]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:24:41.489 --> 01:24:46.910]  Putting off emergency food preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:24:47.705 --> 01:24:49.148]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[01:25:09.885 --> 01:25:15.190]  And they know when they take everything you've got, you're going to get angry and stand up against them.
[01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.432]  That's what North Com and Homeland Security are for.
[01:25:18.253 --> 01:25:19.955]  Let's stand together as the American people.
[01:25:20.035 --> 01:25:21.396]  The phony left, the phony right.
[01:25:21.456 --> 01:25:22.237]  Wake up out of the...
[01:25:23.177 --> 01:25:27.960]  Mirage your living in, break the spell, break the trance you're under, wake up and stand up.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:38.166]  I want to get more into the cyber security bill and some other key headlines and also finish up with some phone calls, but there's a key story up at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:38.206 --> 01:25:48.852]  I can't believe the incredible articles Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo, Steve Watson, Paul Watson, all these other great contributors we now have that post every day at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.520]  And the globalists just can't allow this to continue.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:55.341]  That's why they're trying to shut down the web, restrict free speech.
[01:25:56.421 --> 01:25:59.322]  That's why they're coming after me in all sorts of new inventive ways.
[01:25:59.482 --> 01:26:00.342]  It's not working, though.
[01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:01.483]  People see through it.
[01:26:01.503 --> 01:26:02.083]  They understand.
[01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:03.143]  They know our fruits.
[01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:04.463]  They know our long-term mission.
[01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:06.444]  They understand how many people we've woken up.
[01:26:06.824 --> 01:26:07.804]  They have discernment.
[01:26:10.485 --> 01:26:11.085]  This article.
[01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:11.545]  Warning!
[01:26:11.585 --> 01:26:16.886]  Neocon Palin Tea Party takeover will facilitate Obama re-election.
[01:26:18.287 --> 01:26:20.047]  Every mainline Republican
[01:26:21.263 --> 01:26:24.505]  Being fooled by this needs to see this video.
[01:26:24.525 --> 01:26:34.652]  We're about to air for PrisonPlanet.tv members and for all the listeners listening on the radio, the key audio points we make in this video report.
[01:26:35.213 --> 01:26:35.713]  Here it is.
[01:26:35.773 --> 01:26:36.794]  It's nine minutes long.
[01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:37.815]  We'll be back.
[01:26:38.035 --> 01:26:39.176]  Here's the real Sarah Palin.
[01:26:40.056 --> 01:26:43.739]  Don't say you haven't been warned about Sarah Palin.
[01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:45.360]  Don't say you haven't been warned.
[01:26:46.527 --> 01:26:52.371]  You know, I cut my teeth exposing Bill Clinton as a traitor to this country and going after our Second Amendment, our national sovereignty.
[01:26:52.951 --> 01:26:56.974]  And George Bush tripled the size of government, passed the Patriot Act, Homeland Security.
[01:26:57.475 --> 01:26:58.916]  Yes, Obama reissued it.
[01:26:59.156 --> 01:27:01.797]  But the point is, that was bipartisan.
[01:27:02.358 --> 01:27:03.819]  It gives Obama left cover.
[01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:12.385]  He's expanding wars, biggest defense budgets ever, continuing torture, secret arrest, and the phony right wing comes out and attacks him as a peacenik.
[01:27:13.831 --> 01:27:15.513]  Barack Obama is a corporate whore.
[01:27:16.114 --> 01:27:17.896]  Barack Obama works for the big banks.
[01:27:17.956 --> 01:27:27.027]  Barack Obama is there to bring a form of fake neoliberalism into the United States and worldwide to continue the empire's corruption.
[01:27:28.314 --> 01:27:32.057]  And it's the same thing for Sarah Palin, vetted by Henry Kissinger.
[01:27:32.617 --> 01:27:37.441]  Anybody chosen to be the running mate of John McCain is a nightmare.
[01:27:37.901 --> 01:27:50.730]  If there was any doubt about the true colors of Sarah Palin, it is now 100% clear that she is a fraud and a warmonger and a neocon that will rape you even worse than George W. Bush did.
[01:27:51.611 --> 01:27:52.191]  It's simple.
[01:27:53.114 --> 01:27:57.336]  9-11 has been used to target the American people instead of a police state.
[01:27:57.756 --> 01:27:58.656]  Do you understand that?
[01:27:59.076 --> 01:28:04.559]  We have the secret MIAC and Homeland Security reports that were leaked to us by law enforcement a year ago.
[01:28:05.039 --> 01:28:09.641]  People couldn't believe their contents for four or five days until the government admitted they were real.
[01:28:10.501 --> 01:28:19.630]  The main focus of homeland security and domestic military operations under NORTHCOM is suppressing the states and the governors and we, the people.
[01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:26.616]  The whole thing is targeted at returning veterans, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, libertarians.
[01:28:26.937 --> 01:28:28.118]  That's in the documents.
[01:28:28.278 --> 01:28:31.361]  All 50 states issued these via the federal government.
[01:28:31.901 --> 01:28:33.182]  But what is Sarah Palin doing?
[01:28:34.153 --> 01:28:36.276]  She's saying we need to expand the Patriot Act.
[01:28:36.316 --> 01:28:38.920]  She says we don't need a constitutional lawyer, we need a president.
[01:28:39.541 --> 01:28:41.764]  Really, America is the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:28:42.104 --> 01:28:43.326]  What's her problem with Obama?
[01:28:43.566 --> 01:28:44.968]  He's continued secret arrest.
[01:28:45.228 --> 01:28:46.370]  He's continued torture.
[01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:47.692]  He's expanded the wars.
[01:28:47.892 --> 01:28:50.135]  He's brought us the two biggest defense budgets in history.
[01:28:50.936 --> 01:28:56.319]  She supported the banker bailout that you supported, Palin, along with Glenn Beck and George W. Bush.
[01:28:56.359 --> 01:28:57.520]  What's the problem with Obama?
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:03.303]  The truth is, it's a staged WWF wrestling event, and the American people know this.
[01:29:04.003 --> 01:29:17.211]  It was three years ago, at the start of the Republican campaign for the primaries, that true Tea Parties were formed against both political parties for Ron Paul to truly call for our Republic to be restored.
[01:29:18.564 --> 01:29:20.285]  And now look at us three years later.
[01:29:21.286 --> 01:29:37.477]  In 2009, in January, at Tea Parties in Texas, Governor Rick Perry, who supports the North American Union, seizing 8,000 miles of Texas roads, turning them into toll roads, who supports making girls take Gardasil shots when it's not even the law, and was killing a bunch of people.
[01:29:37.957 --> 01:29:41.520]  Rick Perry, a Bilderberg Group attendee, calling for world government.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:42.941]  That's in the Dallas Morning News.
[01:29:43.661 --> 01:29:47.264]  Rick Perry was being booed everywhere at Tea Parties.
[01:29:47.704 --> 01:29:48.845]  So was Senator Cornyn.
[01:29:49.325 --> 01:29:51.367]  Other neocon Republicans were being booed.
[01:29:51.487 --> 01:29:54.549]  But the Republican Party came in and took over the Tea Parties.
[01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.871]  And now they've officially done it with Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck.
[01:29:57.272 --> 01:29:58.573]  It's run by the RNC.
[01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:00.994]  That's who chartered Tea Party Nation.
[01:30:01.355 --> 01:30:02.696]  That's who funds these events.
[01:30:03.336 --> 01:30:08.580]  And then Sarah Palin gets up in front of the Tea Parties and says, we need to have war with Iran right now.
[01:30:08.981 --> 01:30:11.422]  That's the only thing that'll save Obama's administration.
[01:30:11.683 --> 01:30:13.524]  How hard do you think President Obama will
[01:30:14.465 --> 01:30:16.987]  It depends on a few things.
[01:30:17.127 --> 01:30:22.433]  Say he played, and I got this from Buchanan reading one of his columns the other day.
[01:30:22.493 --> 01:30:23.674]  Say he played the war card.
[01:30:24.194 --> 01:30:32.903]  Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided to really come out and do whatever he could to support Israel, which I would like him to do.
[01:30:34.219 --> 01:30:35.620]  That changes the dynamics.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.341]  You're not suggesting that he would cynically play the war card.
[01:30:38.401 --> 01:30:39.301]  I'm not suggesting that.
[01:30:39.341 --> 01:30:48.906]  I'm saying if he did, things would dramatically change if he decided to toughen up and do all that he can to secure our nation and our allies.
[01:30:49.266 --> 01:30:53.428]  The neocons last week wrote three editorials calling for this to happen.
[01:30:53.728 --> 01:30:55.128]  She supports the Patriot Act.
[01:30:55.348 --> 01:30:57.029]  She supports secret arrests.
[01:30:57.269 --> 01:30:58.530]  She supports torture.
[01:30:58.790 --> 01:31:01.611]  And all of this is designed for the American people.
[01:31:01.911 --> 01:31:03.731]  It's a bait-and-switch, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:04.032 --> 01:31:05.292]  We have the internal documents.
[01:31:05.352 --> 01:31:07.433]  And then, in Texas,
[01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:17.132]  On Super Bowl Sunday in Houston, she gets up and endorses Rick Perry and she says he's going to send a message to Washington.
[01:31:17.232 --> 01:31:20.954]  I can't tell you how proud I am to get to support Governor Rick Perry.
[01:31:20.974 --> 01:31:26.395]  Who better to lead than the successes that we already see here in Texas?
[01:31:26.415 --> 01:31:34.478]  I look forward to Texas sending Washington a message on how things can be done right because you're doing them right in Texas.
[01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:37.331]  Rick Perry is a total whore of Washington.
[01:31:37.551 --> 01:31:40.211]  He supported the banker bailout, just like Palin and Beck did.
[01:31:40.532 --> 01:31:41.392]  Just like Bush did.
[01:31:42.292 --> 01:31:45.213]  Because as many congressmen have said, the foreign banks run this country.
[01:31:45.553 --> 01:31:50.135]  That's the issue, getting past the puppets of Obama and Palin to the real elite.
[01:31:50.775 --> 01:31:57.697]  Meanwhile, Debra Medina, who says that she will secure our borders, give us open carry, Vermont style, true second amendment.
[01:31:58.357 --> 01:32:02.119]  She has said that she will get rid of all these illegal, unlawful toll roads.
[01:32:02.339 --> 01:32:04.801]  The state of Texas, the legislature already said they were illegal.
[01:32:05.021 --> 01:32:05.721]  Perry doesn't care.
[01:32:05.761 --> 01:32:06.581]  He's going ahead with it.
[01:32:06.782 --> 01:32:10.403]  Won't even let the legislature see the contract for this Napa superhighway system.
[01:32:11.044 --> 01:32:18.348]  She said she will completely get rid of the unconstitutional property tax that makes you a serf who pays rent on your own supposed home.
[01:32:19.798 --> 01:32:20.618]  Not Rick Perry.
[01:32:20.698 --> 01:32:27.542]  Rick Perry is new world order and a year ago he started talking like the Tea Parties because he understood that that was the future.
[01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:33.284]  This is the real rebellion against the globalists, against the Copenhagen tax, against the takeover.
[01:32:33.445 --> 01:32:40.408]  But Rick Perry is saying nothing about Austin announcing 2.6 billion in taxes in the next three years of carbon taxes.
[01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:53.235]  So she's calling for war with Iran and saying that Obama can get his approval ratings up by launching an attack on Iran that could start World War III.
[01:32:53.595 --> 01:32:55.596]  That's a direct neocon talking point.
[01:32:55.956 --> 01:32:57.236]  She was vetted by Kissinger.
[01:32:57.496 --> 01:33:01.098]  She was chosen by John McCain as her running mate.
[01:33:01.338 --> 01:33:05.160]  The anti-gun, attacker of free speech with McCain, Feingold.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:06.560]  The guy that supported the bailout.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.681]  What else do you need to know?
[01:33:08.201 --> 01:33:22.475]  And she gets up and pushes the mainline Republican garbage that's killing the Republican Party and a bunch of lapdogs with her phony tripe that this tart puts out start buying into it.
[01:33:22.735 --> 01:33:28.080]  You're just like idiot Obama supporters who really thought he was going to end the war and end torture.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.742]  And in the banker bailouts when he's completely run by it.
[01:33:31.382 --> 01:33:31.883]  Wake up!
[01:33:32.263 --> 01:33:33.364]  Stop being conned!
[01:33:33.624 --> 01:33:35.305]  We don't have time to screw around.
[01:33:35.525 --> 01:33:37.546]  We don't have time to be bamboozled again.
[01:33:37.827 --> 01:33:39.088]  We don't have time to be idiots.
[01:33:39.408 --> 01:33:40.248]  But here's the good news.
[01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:45.152]  It took people six years to wake up to the fact in the polls that Bush was a fraud.
[01:33:45.652 --> 01:33:47.593]  It took people less than a year with Obama.
[01:33:48.174 --> 01:33:51.496]  And so they can go ahead and stick Miss World War III Sarah Palin in.
[01:33:51.736 --> 01:33:53.337]  It'll take a few months to wake up to her.
[01:33:54.218 --> 01:33:56.060]  This bait-and-switch isn't working anymore.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:59.383]  The American people are becoming constitutionalist populist.
[01:33:59.623 --> 01:34:07.170]  They're discovering who the real enemy is, the global New World Order that tried in Copenhagen a few months ago to set up a world tax paid to private banks.
[01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:08.971]  We need to indict Geithner.
[01:34:09.232 --> 01:34:10.473]  We need to arrest the bankers.
[01:34:10.533 --> 01:34:13.315]  It's really over 25 trillion they've stolen.
[01:34:14.096 --> 01:34:17.999]  We need to go after the New World Order and identify the real enemy of our sovereignty.
[01:34:19.065 --> 01:34:22.487]  Mark my words, Sarah Palin is total New World Order garbage.
[01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:30.212]  If she would have endorsed Debra Medina, who's surging in the polls, we could start a real peaceful revolution at the state level.
[01:34:30.452 --> 01:34:39.658]  But instead, like the cavalry, as his polls drop and Debra Medina's polls go up, she came into Texas to tell the people, oh, rebel against tyranny.
[01:34:40.078 --> 01:34:41.179]  Support Glenn Beck.
[01:34:41.679 --> 01:34:43.400]  Support Governor Perry.
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:46.862]  I don't know if any of you caught recently, just a couple of days ago, the Glenn Beck Show.
[01:34:47.062 --> 01:34:47.823]  Holy moly!
[01:34:52.450 --> 01:35:00.792]  This segment was on the different states and how everybody's doing, and according to Glenn Beck and all these researchers, jeez, you guys are just walking on water.
[01:35:00.812 --> 01:35:03.733]  The way things are going in Texas!
[01:35:04.033 --> 01:35:11.315]  You gotta catch his episode on that because he recognized, so many people are recognizing, that Texas is open for business.
[01:35:11.675 --> 01:35:13.795]  And companies and people, they're moving here.
[01:35:13.855 --> 01:35:16.876]  They keep moving here because they know that Governor Perry gets it.
[01:35:17.236 --> 01:35:18.657]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:18.998 --> 01:35:23.162]  It's the neocons that are running the Obama administration.
[01:35:23.622 --> 01:35:26.025]  They're the neocons who run Fox News.
[01:35:26.906 --> 01:35:29.689]  We've got the Fox Nation, we've got the Tea Party Nation.
[01:35:30.289 --> 01:35:35.735]  They're trying to take control of the real opposition to the New World Order and control it and destroy it.
[01:35:37.116 --> 01:35:46.419]  If you want smaller government, if you want to return to liberty and freedom, you better realize we're being looted by offshore corporations and not be suckered by Miss Alaska, Sarah Palin.
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:51.541]  This woman is openly calling for a declaration of war against Iran.
[01:35:52.081 --> 01:35:55.202]  This woman is a fraud and a danger to humanity.
[01:35:55.703 --> 01:35:56.783]  Here's the most important point.
[01:35:56.983 --> 01:35:59.304]  I don't want Barack Obama in office in three years.
[01:35:59.384 --> 01:36:04.246]  I'd like to elect a true constitutionalist like Ron Paul or somebody else.
[01:36:05.106 --> 01:36:14.008]  But she's being positioned so that she can be destroyed and so she can be torn down so Barack Obama will be your next president again in 2012.
[01:36:14.849 --> 01:36:15.829]  You mark my words.
[01:36:16.489 --> 01:36:18.189]  Wake up and stop being suckered.
[01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:24.831]  This video needs to go viral to all the idiot neocons and all the idiot Obama supporters so this fraud can be exposed.
[01:36:25.251 --> 01:36:27.312]  I'm Alex Jones from InfoWars.com.
[01:36:29.969 --> 01:36:35.817]  And again, you can go to InfoWars.com and get the warning neoconpailant article by Aaron Dykes.
[01:36:35.857 --> 01:36:42.827]  It has the video posted, plus all the links you see in the video, to video and news articles and documents.
[01:36:43.408 --> 01:36:46.692]  Remember, when Ron Paul could have won the Republican nomination,
[01:36:47.901 --> 01:36:47.961]  I'm
[01:37:05.988 --> 01:37:06.828]  Huge amount of giving.
[01:37:07.608 --> 01:37:08.829]  This is what they're doing.
[01:37:08.909 --> 01:37:12.029]  They know what they're doing.
[01:37:12.570 --> 01:37:14.870]  And Sarah Palin saying she wants all these wars.
[01:37:15.370 --> 01:37:18.411]  Sarah Palin saying she wants to declare war on Iran.
[01:37:18.931 --> 01:37:21.131]  Telling Obama, play that card to get re-elected.
[01:37:21.552 --> 01:37:25.913]  That's her job and she knows exactly what she's doing.
[01:37:26.093 --> 01:37:29.233]  Hey, if you want to be scammed, you want to be conned, go ahead and be suckered again.
[01:37:30.314 --> 01:37:32.054]  We need to go after the real government.
[01:37:32.961 --> 01:37:38.787]  Above Obama, above Sarah Palin, above John McCain, above all these people, to the offshore banks.
[01:37:39.768 --> 01:37:43.391]  Now, shifting gears again, I want to show you the Drudge Report right now.
[01:37:44.653 --> 01:37:56.845]  Up on the Drudge Report, they moved it right up to the top, red link to our article about the naked body scanners being used
[01:37:58.171 --> 01:38:07.597]  To record people's bodies, and when movie stars and TV stars go through, they record it, print off their naked body, and go over to them and ask them to sign it.
[01:38:07.857 --> 01:38:12.300]  Click on that link for people live on TV, right now, and radio.
[01:38:13.041 --> 01:38:16.343]  You click on that link, it goes to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:38:16.403 --> 01:38:18.004]  Expose naked body scammer.
[01:38:19.278 --> 01:38:20.079]  Keep saying scammer.
[01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:20.899]  It's a Freudian slip.
[01:38:20.939 --> 01:38:21.580]  It is a scam.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:28.384]  They exposed naked body scanner images of Filmstar printed, circulated by airport staff.
[01:38:28.404 --> 01:38:31.366]  And we have the video of this TV star talking about it.
[01:38:31.626 --> 01:38:33.247]  We've already confirmed this is going on.
[01:38:33.287 --> 01:38:35.929]  Of course they're recording on a hard drive with your name.
[01:38:35.969 --> 01:38:37.650]  You can see them typing into the database.
[01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:39.391]  Government documents admit this.
[01:38:39.752 --> 01:38:44.135]  We can kill these naked body scanners now by exposing this.
[01:38:44.195 --> 01:38:49.078]  We can kill, just like we destroyed and defeated the carbon tax takeover in the Senate.
[01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:54.439]  By exposing what a fraud these are.
[01:38:54.459 --> 01:38:55.579]  I had a guest on yesterday.
[01:38:55.599 --> 01:38:57.340]  He's a constitutional lawyer in Denver.
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:00.221]  Tried to go in the courthouse in the county that Denver's located in.
[01:39:00.741 --> 01:39:02.201]  They wanted a naked body scan him.
[01:39:02.241 --> 01:39:02.821]  He said no.
[01:39:02.861 --> 01:39:04.602]  Then they would search him, grab his genitals.
[01:39:05.502 --> 01:39:06.982]  He pointed out that it was illegal.
[01:39:07.142 --> 01:39:09.803]  They were scanning little kids, which is a child porn violation.
[01:39:10.623 --> 01:39:15.769]  They now aren't scanning people below the age of 18, and they're just doing wines of other people.
[01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:17.231]  This is illegal.
[01:39:17.271 --> 01:39:28.705]  They're trying to set a precedent with all of this, and we've got to say no, and everybody has got to get the article that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and that's on the front page of Drudge, LinkedIn Red.
[01:39:30.532 --> 01:39:36.536]  Naked body scanner images of Filmstar printed, circulated by airport staff.
[01:39:36.916 --> 01:39:40.419]  If that isn't sensational tyranny, I don't know what is.
[01:39:40.479 --> 01:39:41.879]  And you get this out to people.
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:47.003]  This is another death knell so people know the truth that they're being recorded.
[01:39:47.263 --> 01:39:48.484]  Let's go to Joe in Texas.
[01:39:48.524 --> 01:39:49.264]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:39:49.284 --> 01:39:49.885]  Thanks for holding.
[01:39:50.666 --> 01:39:52.106]  Hey, thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:39:52.646 --> 01:39:53.047]  Welcome.
[01:39:53.067 --> 01:39:54.767]  I hope you have a happy birthday.
[01:39:55.247 --> 01:39:57.508]  Alex, I'm calling about an article I just got.
[01:39:57.528 --> 01:39:58.968]  I don't know how you document everything.
[01:39:58.988 --> 01:40:01.888]  It's in the Medina Electric Cooperative.
[01:40:02.369 --> 01:40:06.550]  It regards the census, and it says take the census precautions.
[01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:15.371]  They've got 140 states, more than 140,000 census workers are charged with counting every person in the United States.
[01:40:15.391 --> 01:40:17.792]  It says that they're going to start the first step in March.
[01:40:18.433 --> 01:40:23.418]  That uh, then it skips down here and says, if it is a U.S.
[01:40:23.458 --> 01:40:39.334]  Census worker knocking on your door, he or she will be wearing a badge and carrying a Census Bureau Canvas bag, a confidentiality notice, and a computer equipped with GPS software to reduce the number of geographic coding errors created by using maps.
[01:40:39.454 --> 01:40:40.194]  Yeah, let me be clear.
[01:40:40.214 --> 01:40:43.856]  They've already, in the last year, gotten everybody's front door GPSed.
[01:40:44.036 --> 01:40:53.000]  Under the Fifth Amendment, you don't have to answer any questions, but how many people live in the house, and they have about five or more, five we know of, different versions.
[01:40:53.421 --> 01:41:00.364]  One has 10 questions, one has 40, one has 100, one has more than that, up to over 200 questions with some of these community surveys.
[01:41:01.084 --> 01:41:02.084]  What do you have in the bank?
[01:41:02.144 --> 01:41:03.224]  Do you own firearms?
[01:41:03.284 --> 01:41:04.665]  What type of toilet do you have?
[01:41:04.965 --> 01:41:10.266]  These are actual questions, and they show up with these fake badges and threaten you.
[01:41:10.626 --> 01:41:17.387]  If you were a murderer caught with 50 bodies in your basement, you're not compelled to incriminate yourself.
[01:41:17.447 --> 01:41:18.427]  It's the Fifth Amendment.
[01:41:19.048 --> 01:41:22.848]  And they want to have monthly, first yearly, then monthly census.
[01:41:23.308 --> 01:41:25.949]  They want the census to be the new secret police spies.
[01:41:26.869 --> 01:41:35.974]  And they're running all these, you know, 100 million, one of them was a $145 million ad package I saw last week just to brainwash about the census.
[01:41:36.715 --> 01:41:41.417]  And, you know, they came to my door in 2000 and said, all you said was two people live here.
[01:41:41.458 --> 01:41:43.459]  And I said, yeah, it's me and my girlfriend, now my wife.
[01:41:44.219 --> 01:41:46.240]  You took the words right out of what they're saying here too, Alex.
[01:42:10.225 --> 01:42:13.286]  Well, the Sims Bureau might ask for basic financial information.
[01:42:13.786 --> 01:42:14.726]  Yeah, basic.
[01:42:14.786 --> 01:42:15.626]  It's not basic.
[01:42:15.826 --> 01:42:18.367]  They ask salary, bank accounts, stocks, bonds.
[01:42:18.787 --> 01:42:20.047]  None of your business!
[01:42:20.888 --> 01:42:27.869]  A cop can't show up at your door and ask you that, but cops are showing up and doing knock and talk where they ask about your firearms.
[01:42:27.929 --> 01:42:28.990]  They have no right!
[01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:33.931]  They're setting the precedent that government agents, secret police get to ask you questions.
[01:42:35.071 --> 01:42:36.152]  Send me the article, okay?
[01:42:36.172 --> 01:42:38.192]  Send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:42:38.232 --> 01:42:39.133]  What's the headline again?
[01:42:39.913 --> 01:42:43.735]  Uh, yes sir, it's called, uh, uh, Take Census Precaution.
[01:42:44.695 --> 01:42:56.681]  And then the amazing thing, what they're doing to Austin, is right beside it, Alex, and now I will send you the article, right beside it, they have where the federal government's allocating all of this grant money for electric power.
[01:42:57.421 --> 01:42:58.402]  I know, it's incredible.
[01:42:58.522 --> 01:42:59.022]  Stay with us.
[01:43:00.911 --> 01:43:07.216]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:43:07.596 --> 01:43:13.720]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:43:14.001 --> 01:43:20.005]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:43:20.325 --> 01:43:25.229]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:33.556]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:43:33.876 --> 01:43:38.039]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.943]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or
[01:43:42.423 --> 01:43:46.625]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:46.645 --> 01:43:49.146]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:49.326 --> 01:43:51.627]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:13.418]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:13.438 --> 01:44:19.679]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:19.839 --> 01:44:24.860]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:25.021 --> 01:44:28.181]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:44:28.201 --> 01:44:35.003]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:35.123 --> 01:44:37.244]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:37.484 --> 01:44:38.805]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:39.065 --> 01:44:41.346]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:41.527 --> 01:44:43.368]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:43.648 --> 01:44:48.390]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:48.810 --> 01:44:57.915]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:00.501 --> 01:45:04.485]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[01:45:04.786 --> 01:45:07.628]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:45:08.049 --> 01:45:14.696]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy.
[01:45:15.036 --> 01:45:19.821]  If we, the people, do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost
[01:45:19.921 --> 01:45:20.181]  I'm good.
[01:45:34.838 --> 01:45:35.938]  Utopia Silver in this fight.
[01:45:36.299 --> 01:45:43.701]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high quality health supplements.

[01:45:51.824 --> 01:45:51.884]  1-888-213-4338.
[01:46:00.125 --> 01:46:02.333]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:46:02.896 --> 01:46:05.706]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:20.292]  I saw similar polls in Texas, but these are public policy polls, one of the big nationals.
[01:46:21.392 --> 01:46:24.713]  Perry's at 39, Hutchinson 28, Debra Medina 24.
[01:46:25.313 --> 01:46:28.193]  She's getting about 5 points a week.
[01:46:28.614 --> 01:46:32.775]  Some weeks she gets 6, some weeks she gets 3, but it's trending up.
[01:46:33.535 --> 01:46:34.435]  We've got a month.
[01:46:36.274 --> 01:46:38.857]  Coming up in about, what, 10 days?
[01:46:39.157 --> 01:46:43.901]  Yeah, 10 days, early voting starts, and we've got about a week or so after that into the elections.
[01:46:43.921 --> 01:46:44.942]  We've got less than a month.
[01:46:46.384 --> 01:46:51.369]  Trending, she'll be past Hutchinson, but they'll try to make up some scandals soon against Medina.
[01:46:51.809 --> 01:46:53.210]  They're afraid to give her too much attention.
[01:46:53.551 --> 01:46:57.635]  She'll pass Hutchinson by early voting and may be able to beat Perry.
[01:46:59.008 --> 01:47:01.450]  How exciting is that information?
[01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:05.732]  But Sarah Palin's down here to prop up Perry, as I just talked about.
[01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:08.614]  I meant to get more into the cybersecurity bill today.
[01:47:09.575 --> 01:47:10.815]  I covered most of the news.
[01:47:11.416 --> 01:47:11.856]  Here it is.
[01:47:11.956 --> 01:47:12.336]  Poll.
[01:47:12.376 --> 01:47:13.977]  Medina closing on Hutchinson.
[01:47:14.798 --> 01:47:15.798]  Again, that's Politico.
[01:47:17.119 --> 01:47:18.820]  And again, this isn't just about Texas.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.721]  It's about the entire country.
[01:47:20.761 --> 01:47:21.822]  This message it sends.
[01:47:22.062 --> 01:47:24.404]  Hey, her already getting these many points is already a victory.
[01:47:25.475 --> 01:47:33.405]  Keep fighting, but regardless if she wins, loses, draws, whatever, the electronic voting machines will probably come into this for the globalists, but that's the race in the hole.
[01:47:33.745 --> 01:47:39.252]  But this message to all the other states and all these other candidates, we don't want your Rick Perry, Sarah Palin people.
[01:47:39.592 --> 01:47:41.655]  We want real constitutionalists.
[01:47:42.135 --> 01:47:44.919]  I cannot describe to you how amazing this is.
[01:47:47.555 --> 01:47:50.056]  Oh man, I tell you, what an amazing broadcast today.
[01:47:50.096 --> 01:47:52.157]  I want to try to jam in a call or two here at the end.
[01:47:52.197 --> 01:47:58.200]  I just want to remind listeners at the close of the show, if you believe in what we've done here together in 14 years,
[01:47:59.810 --> 01:48:04.233]  You need to know now is the time to talk to your neighbors, to knock on doors, to warn people, to have viewing parties.
[01:48:04.293 --> 01:48:06.355]  Now is the time to show people, follow the Republic.
[01:48:06.615 --> 01:48:10.337]  Because the Republic is falling into history and into tyranny if we don't wake them up.
[01:48:10.437 --> 01:48:16.602]  Somebody watches this 2 hour, 24 minute film, they've got an overview of the entire program, the entire system and how to stop them.
[01:48:17.122 --> 01:48:21.505]  Somebody sees the Obama deception, a fake right winger will watch it thinking it's going to bash Obama.
[01:48:21.785 --> 01:48:23.546]  It wakes them up that both parties are controlled.
[01:48:24.407 --> 01:48:25.788]  Terror storm, end game.
[01:48:26.168 --> 01:48:27.149]  Give you the bigger agenda.
[01:48:28.464 --> 01:48:29.665]  Infowars.com.
[01:48:30.685 --> 01:48:33.267]  Download them at superhighqualityprisonplanet.tv.
[01:48:33.787 --> 01:48:34.907]  Order the DVDs.
[01:48:35.007 --> 01:48:38.449]  Support us so that we can stand up against this New World Order.
[01:48:39.029 --> 01:48:45.493]  If you don't stand up, if you don't financially support, if you don't get out there and wake people up to support Medina and others, we know we're going to lose.
[01:48:46.153 --> 01:48:50.475]  But we know we're having victory after victory after victory against tyranny.
[01:48:50.796 --> 01:48:53.077]  So if you'll take action, game over for the New World Order.
[01:48:53.817 --> 01:48:59.058]  We're going to put banners and icons up in the next 24 hours at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:49:00.018 --> 01:49:16.141]  There's a big article by Kurt Nemo up at InfoWars.com right now, and it says, it has the links where you can download for free the iPhone app to listen to this show wherever you want, however you want to save it.
[01:49:16.481 --> 01:49:17.721]  We're adding archives to it.
[01:49:17.881 --> 01:49:22.162]  It's got an alarm clock, a bunch of other systems on your iPhone.
[01:49:23.573 --> 01:49:24.033]  Right now
[01:49:38.885 --> 01:49:40.446]  Video apps, you name it.
[01:49:40.526 --> 01:49:41.307]  It's all coming.
[01:49:41.367 --> 01:49:42.488]  It's all in the pipeline.
[01:49:42.828 --> 01:49:44.469]  We're building the TV studio.
[01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:47.011]  Four months of fighting to get permits from the city.
[01:49:47.051 --> 01:49:48.112]  That's going on now.
[01:49:48.392 --> 01:49:49.773]  They're in there building it right now.
[01:49:49.793 --> 01:49:52.335]  I'm working on this newspaper operation.
[01:49:52.375 --> 01:49:54.617]  I'm working on two films simultaneously.
[01:49:54.637 --> 01:49:55.958]  Oh, we're out of time.
[01:49:55.998 --> 01:49:57.059]  I meant to go to the rest of the calls.
[01:49:57.079 --> 01:49:57.820]  Call me back tomorrow.
[01:49:59.252 --> 01:50:07.638]  Retransmission where I cover all the key headlines in just two minutes at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com on the free streams.
[01:50:07.658 --> 01:50:09.079]  If you don't have an iPhone, don't worry.
[01:50:09.099 --> 01:50:11.741]  We have Flycast for other cell phones.
[01:50:11.761 --> 01:50:13.622]  We have a bunch of other internet listening options.
[01:50:13.922 --> 01:50:17.825]  At the top of InfoWars.com it says Alex Jones Radio Show.
[01:50:18.205 --> 01:50:18.726]  See right here?
[01:50:20.083 --> 01:50:28.707]  Right here on the top of the screen, you can click on the top of the screen and see all the different internet listening options or your AM and FM affiliates, Global Shortwave Satellite.
[01:50:29.047 --> 01:50:30.027]  Great job, crew!
[01:50:30.548 --> 01:50:34.930]  We are part, ladies and gentlemen, of the restoration of the Republic, the rising spirit of 1776.
[01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:37.491]  God bless you all.
[01:50:37.551 --> 01:50:38.591]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:38.811 --> 01:50:39.492]  Spread the word!
