[00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:09.978]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:11.559]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.499]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:28.122]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:29.743]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:33.964]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, the ninth day of February.
[00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:34.986]  2010.
[00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:39.647]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:39.647 --> 00:00:50.131]  Wayne Madsen on a host of breaking key news will be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:50.571]  We have
[00:00:51.673 --> 00:01:00.661]  Dr. William J. Hersey, who testified before Congress about the dangers of fluoridation of water, joining us.
[00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:14.274]  It is not widely known that the majority of EPA scientists and toxicologists sent a petition several years ago to their own bosses at the Environmental Protection Agency pointing out just how deadly.
[00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:16.623]  Fluoride is.
[00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:21.125]  And when you hear the term fluoride, on average it's over 150 chemicals they add to the water.
[00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:22.205]  Some cities over 300.
[00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:27.867]  And I know most of the audience already knows this, but your neighbors don't.
[00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:30.608]  They just think, oh, that's what kooks say.
[00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:33.608]  Well, you're going to hear this from a top EPA scientist.
[00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:40.931]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, and then of course Wayne Madsen, open phones in the fourth hour today.
[00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:45.392]  Massive news blitz in this hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:50.754]  I have five large stacks in front of me.
[00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:55.068]  Let me just mention some of what's in the first stack, then I'll go through this in detail coming up in the hour.
[00:01:56.121 --> 00:02:02.365]  Exposed naked body scanner images of film star printed and circulated by airport staff.
[00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:05.767]  They not only record your genitals, they share them.
[00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:14.893]  And I've talked to tons of media witnesses, reporters that have seen good-looking women get ushered in, they laugh, they stare, they enjoy, they record, they save.
[00:02:14.893 --> 00:02:16.114]  Of course they're recording it all.
[00:02:16.114 --> 00:02:18.135]  It's a biometric body scan.
[00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:20.077]  It's not just a weapon screener.
[00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:23.034]  And so we'll be breaking that down.
[00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:24.415]  This is huge news.
[00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:31.219]  Authorities claim that virtual strip search pictures immediately destroyed, proven fraudulent.
[00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.241]  Use of devices needs to be halted now.
[00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:39.704]  Just like, oh, they told you 14 years ago when I was exposing it, we're not taking your baby's blood for DNA databases.
[00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:43.426]  And now they say, oh, Alex Jones is right.
[00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:47.088]  37 years worldwide in every Western country.
[00:02:47.088 --> 00:02:48.148]  We take it for the UN.
[00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:54.889]  I mean, they don't even take the blood from criminals, but they will take it from you.
[00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.510]  Oh, they will.
[00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.991]  Oh, they will.
[00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:03.634]  Rasmussen poll, and I'll guarantee you it's even higher than this, because most people, when you call them and say, do you hate the government?
[00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:06.516]  A lot of them get scared and say, oh no, I love it.
[00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:08.277]  Oh, I like it.
[00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:12.639]  But 75% are angry at government's current policies.
[00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.621]  So, knowing the science of polls, I'd say it's more like 90%, 95%.
[00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:22.978]  But don't worry, the government wants to get control of the internet now.
[00:03:22.978 --> 00:03:24.418]  We can't have all this dissent.
[00:03:24.418 --> 00:03:27.359]  We can't have the slaves talking to each other.
[00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:27.679]  U.S.
[00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:32.780]  faces serious threat in cybersecurity, says John Brennan from the White House.
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.861]  And don't worry, the Pentagon's taking it over.
[00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:38.502]  I've got the cybersecurity bill here in front of me that passed the House last week.
[00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:46.244]  I will take some time today to actually go over the subsections that are in this Orwellian monstrosity.
[00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:52.164]  A key article by Aaron Dykes he posted in the early morning hours today.
[00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:53.605]  Internet censorship alert.
[00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:55.406]  Alex Jones exposes agenda.
[00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:58.968]  The blacklist dissenting sites and licensed users.
[00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:13.238]  It is a key 10-minute video with all the documents and news articles that gives people a wide-spectrum analysis of the attack on the Internet going on globally, publicly coordinated by the UN and Microsoft, as well as our criminal White House.
[00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.240]  So please get that story out to everyone.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.063]  This is a main action item.
[00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:22.124]  All of these stories are.
[00:04:22.124 --> 00:04:28.648]  People find out they are recording your naked body and saving it, they're going to be even more angry about the naked body scanners.
[00:04:28.648 --> 00:04:29.629]  Get that out to everybody.
[00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:31.276]  U.S.
[00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:33.298]  government plans new climate service.
[00:04:33.298 --> 00:04:33.798]  That's right.
[00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:36.340]  They don't care if the Senate won't pass it.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.201]  Obama is going to release his youth brigades.
[00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:41.403]  By the way, that's in the cyber security bill too.
[00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:44.985]  The youth brigades working for homeland security.
[00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:47.707]  And we told you it was going to happen under Codex Alimentarius.
[00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:49.248]  This is out of the National Post of Canada.
[00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:58.641]  The government sent a notice to all pharmacies and drug stores and health food stores saying, look, no more vitamins, no more minerals, no more nothing.
[00:04:58.641 --> 00:04:59.522]  Ha ha ha!
[00:04:59.522 --> 00:05:00.583]  You want freedom?
[00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:01.744]  What's your home worth?
[00:05:01.744 --> 00:05:03.866]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:06.569]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:14.614]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of the tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:18.276]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.718]  It's so easy, and best of all, it's free.
[00:05:20.718 --> 00:05:29.003]  At HomeGain.com, you can compare realtors anonymously, receive customized proposals, see consumer reviews, then select the best realtor for you.
[00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:31.985]  Go to HomeGain.com and get an instant home value estimate.
[00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:32.665]  Let's do it!
[00:06:02.347 --> 00:06:06.395]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.395 --> 00:06:09.642]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:11.044]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.947 --> 00:06:14.409]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.815]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:26.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.989]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:38.450]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.050]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.511]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:44.351]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:49.773]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.773 --> 00:06:58.956]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:05.607]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:07:05.607 --> 00:07:13.798]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:16.101]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable
[00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:22.076]  Today, we offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:25.977]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[00:07:25.977 --> 00:07:30.499]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:31.819]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:36.380]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.022]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:07:42.202 --> 00:07:44.403]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:07:44.403 --> 00:07:45.844]  No word about IRAs.
[00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:48.666]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:53.609]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:53.869]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:54.709]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:55.750]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.971]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:18.420]  Coming up in one hour and 52 minutes, I have a special announcement for all the InfoWarriors out there.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.082]  This is pretty darn big.
[00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:22.986]  We're very, very excited about it.
[00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:27.192]  So coming up in roughly two hours, start your engines.
[00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:37.529]  And it is the beginning of a lot of new things we're going to be doing here, stepping up the fight against the New World Order.
[00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:41.712]  It is Tuesday, the ninth day of February, 2010.
[00:08:41.712 --> 00:08:47.656]  Hard to believe in two days I'm going to be 36.
[00:08:47.656 --> 00:08:54.960]  Seems like yesterday that I started my fight against the New World Order when I was in college, back when I was 21 years old.
[00:08:56.414 --> 00:09:00.357]  And here we are all these years later.
[00:09:00.357 --> 00:09:01.538]  It's amazing.
[00:09:01.538 --> 00:09:04.220]  Look at all we've done together, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.765]  The testament that we have been to the human spirit of resistance to tyranny.
[00:09:09.765 --> 00:09:12.888]  The spirit of liberty.
[00:09:12.888 --> 00:09:21.214]  And how many people we've woken up who've become powerful activists and filmmakers and radio talk show hosts.
[00:09:21.214 --> 00:09:24.978]  It's just so exciting and I'm so honored to be here with you.
[00:09:26.218 --> 00:09:31.122]  Okay, Dr. William J. Hersey coming up.
[00:09:31.122 --> 00:09:33.364]  Government scientist exposing the fluoride.
[00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:36.146]  Then Wayne Madsen with some amazing information.
[00:09:36.146 --> 00:09:39.008]  Key info coming up in the third hour.
[00:09:39.008 --> 00:09:40.510]  Open phones in the fourth hour.
[00:09:42.478 --> 00:09:49.603]  In fact, I'm going to open the phones up in this hour specifically on several issues.
[00:09:49.603 --> 00:09:54.847]  Internet censorship by ISPs and governments intensifying around the world.
[00:09:54.847 --> 00:09:58.410]  The draconian cyber security bill takeover.
[00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:04.034]  And Sarah Palin saying, along with all the big neocons, another editorial today, play the war card!
[00:10:05.106 --> 00:10:08.547]  National Review saying launch an attack on Iran.
[00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:10.828]  That'll get your approval rating up Obama.
[00:10:10.828 --> 00:10:15.129]  They want him to continue the neocon agenda that runs his White House.
[00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:31.214]  His approval rating is plunging and plunging and plunging and plunging and plunging and he will no doubt have the lowest approval rating of any president in modern history including Richard Nixon within six months at the current slide rate.
[00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.135]  The problem is the establishment has
[00:10:34.585 --> 00:10:43.108]  Mitt Romney, the neocon, and Sarah nuke Iran Palin, flapping around waiting in the wings.
[00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:47.909]  Huckabee says he absolutely backs the drive to bomb Iran.
[00:10:47.909 --> 00:10:56.192]  Doesn't matter that the public has been bamboozled on this, just like they've been manipulated with Iraq with WMDs.
[00:10:56.192 --> 00:10:57.713]  Remember six months ago or so?
[00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.940]  Iran, it was all over the news, oh my gosh, secret nuke facility.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:15.144]  Then you read the fine print that they were reporting to the UN six months before, six to eight months under the regulations that they're under, they're under global government like everybody else, that they were going to start enrichment in six months.
[00:11:15.144 --> 00:11:23.626]  It was not a secret facility and they've now asked the UN to come into their other facilities and oversee the fact that it's not anywhere near weapons grade.
[00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:24.387]  Does it matter?
[00:11:24.387 --> 00:11:28.488]  Our media says Iran must be attacked now.
[00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:32.544]  And they'll stage some nice terror attacks here in the United States.
[00:11:32.544 --> 00:11:36.828]  Iran will probably actually stage some real ones, you know, in response.
[00:11:36.828 --> 00:11:40.171]  And then they get to shut down the internet and free speech and all the rest of it.
[00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:46.756]  And they're certainly gearing up for that right now with their Council of Governors, cybersecurity, and the whole other nine yards.
[00:11:47.797 --> 00:11:49.779]  So the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:49.919]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:49.999]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:56.545]  And of course the websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Auxiliary, Backup, Attack Frigates and the InfoWars, InfoWars.net,
[00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:34.923]  JonesReport.com, TruthNews.us, WhatIsTheEndGame.com, FollowTheRepublic.com, ArnoldExposed.com, and other backup sites that we have that are unnamed, waiting in the wings, secret mirrors.
[00:12:34.923 --> 00:12:39.487]  And of course, countless listeners creating their own mirrors in their countries.
[00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:52.236]  As we plant the seeds globally of awakening and resistance to dehumanization and tyranny.
[00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:57.279]  John McCain says the Tea Party movement is racist.
[00:12:57.279 --> 00:13:05.863]  That's right, an InfoWars.com story by Kurt Nemo, according to Megan McCain, daughter of John McCain, the Tea Party is chock full of racists.
[00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:10.110]  McCain's daughter, Tea Party Movement is racist.
[00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:22.152]  Once again appearing on The View, McCain slammed the Tea Party Movement, said young people are turned off by its innate racism.
[00:13:22.152 --> 00:13:30.314]  And she is, of course, parroting what Jimmy Carter and Carlos Watson and
[00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:38.564]  Chris Matthews and others, including Keith Uberman, say, oh, you don't want bigger government, you don't want government health care.
[00:13:38.564 --> 00:13:40.425]  Racist!
[00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:49.909]  And that's actually the true racism, invoking race, making everything a racial issue, and attacking Palin, which then
[00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:54.898]  Americans will see this as fraudulent and then support Palin.
[00:13:54.898 --> 00:13:59.799]  Because, oh my gosh, the discredited establishment liberals are attacking her.
[00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:00.799]  She must be good.
[00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:06.861]  Kind of like Europe signed on to the carbon taxes because the idiot George Bush was against it.
[00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:16.083]  But then at the key moment, he flip-flopped in his last year in office, as we told you months before he would, when we got the intel at Bilderberg in Greece, that Bush was going to go for it.
[00:14:17.162 --> 00:14:29.614]  Then you saw all the Fortune 500 get behind it, the NFL, all the major sitcoms, and News Corp's holdings in TV, entertainment, and newspapers.
[00:14:29.614 --> 00:14:34.198]  So this is the establishment agenda that is moving forward.
[00:14:34.198 --> 00:14:37.021]  Let me get into this news item first, though.
[00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:48.738]  If you read what the United Nations has proposed, and if you read what England is moving forward with, and what Europe is moving forward with, and what the U.S.
[00:14:48.738 --> 00:15:00.505]  is even beginning to propose, they state that there will be no over-the-counter fish oil, vitamin C, aloe vera.
[00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:05.828]  They like to start out by demonizing things like colloidal silver, oil of oregano,
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:20.748]  And sometimes they'll be of tens of thousands of supplements, some particular type of bark or root that, yeah, if you eat a whole bottle of it can make you have a heart attack, so can aspirin, for that matter.
[00:15:20.748 --> 00:15:30.974]  And so they sell it like, oh my gosh, you know, look, this guy was taking caffeine pills and had a heart attack, a truck driver, oh my gosh, we've got to ban it.
[00:15:30.974 --> 00:15:35.877]  But the truth is, there are incredible treatments and cures
[00:15:36.994 --> 00:15:42.137]  On record, with so many mainline supplements.
[00:15:42.137 --> 00:15:43.858]  And the globalists can't patent it.
[00:15:43.858 --> 00:15:53.004]  But in the last few decades, and really the last 6-7 years it's been accelerating, they have been allowed to get patents, drug patents.
[00:15:53.004 --> 00:16:00.629]  They've changed the rules on fish oil, on vitamin C, on a host of other, you know, incredible super nutrients.
[00:16:01.744 --> 00:16:12.720]  And so what's happening is people go to see their medical doctors now who want to be able to prescribe this because it really is good, but it costs $140 for a bottle of fish oil that would be $20 at the store.
[00:16:16.801 --> 00:16:27.924]  And so we have guests up here, we read the Codex Alimentarius, this private consortium through UN law, we break down what they're doing, and I get emails going, they're not gonna ban vitamin C, that's fear-mongering!
[00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:32.506]  They're not gonna ban over-the-counter fish oil and aloe vera!
[00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:33.566]  That's never gonna happen!
[00:16:33.566 --> 00:16:34.466]  Come on, man!
[00:16:34.466 --> 00:16:36.367]  Oh, really?
[00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:58.163]  With our law, the regulators in Canada, and the same things now happening in Germany and England, are sending letters to health food stores, to pharmacies, to anybody that sells vitamins, minerals, nutrients, and saying, you will not do this or you are open to liability from us.
[00:16:58.163 --> 00:17:05.388]  And here's the National Post, one of the biggest papers in Canada, it's the National Paper of Canada, based out of Ottawa,
[00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.751]  Stop selling unlicensed natural health remedies.
[00:17:10.751 --> 00:17:13.812]  Pharmacy regulators.
[00:17:13.812 --> 00:17:15.593]  It's kind of like Obama.
[00:17:15.593 --> 00:17:20.774]  Can't get the Senate to pass his greenhouse gas tax takeover, home inspections, youth brigades.
[00:17:20.774 --> 00:17:24.896]  I mean, we cover the bill from clips of C-SPAN, the infall of the Republic.
[00:17:24.896 --> 00:17:26.516]  I mean, you can't make up what's in this.
[00:17:26.516 --> 00:17:31.678]  He just went ahead and today announced, we're launching a new green agency.
[00:17:31.678 --> 00:17:32.318]  It's over.
[00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:33.138]  We don't care.
[00:17:33.138 --> 00:17:34.379]  EPA, we're doing it.
[00:17:34.379 --> 00:17:34.879]  We're taxing
[00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.433]  Scores of gases, including carbon dioxide.
[00:17:40.433 --> 00:17:42.835]  They just don't care.
[00:17:42.835 --> 00:17:45.357]  Well, here it is.
[00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:48.980]  Stop selling unlicensed natural health remedies, pharmacy regulators.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:18:04.492]  Makers of natural health products say they are bracing for widespread layoffs and millions of dollars in losses after Canada's pharmacy regulators issued a surprise directive recently urging druggists to stop selling unlicensed natural remedies.
[00:18:06.343 --> 00:18:19.804]  The order affects thousands of herbal treatments, multivitamins, and other products, most of them waiting for approval from health care under the backlog five-year-old program to regulate natural health goods.
[00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:37.664]  The Natural Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities says pharmacists cannot be assured the products are safe until they are granted a government license and should not sell them in those circumstances on their store shelves over-the-counter.
[00:18:37.664 --> 00:18:44.529]  Pharmacists are obliged to hold the health and safety of the public or patient as their first and foremost consideration.
[00:18:45.697 --> 00:18:48.138]  Said the association's recently issued position statement.
[00:18:48.138 --> 00:19:05.347]  So, you can sell H1N1 shot full of RNA and viruses and mercury, and you can sell and push Gardasil that admittedly kills and maims large numbers of people on record, even in their own trials of it, and you can sell Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:19:05.347 --> 00:19:11.551]  Ritalin swells the heart, retards growth, literally causes brain damage.
[00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.111]  Prozac, the same thing.
[00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:13.752]  That's fine!
[00:19:15.011 --> 00:19:18.193]  You can sell Merck Vioxx all day long.
[00:19:18.193 --> 00:19:19.914]  You can sell FinFin.
[00:19:19.914 --> 00:19:22.536]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:27.339]  But you don't let them get those vitamins.
[00:19:28.956 --> 00:19:38.481]  Representatives of the natural health industry, however, have reacted angrily to the directive issued last month, predicting it will have little impact on patient safety while triggering an economic crisis for their members.
[00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:39.701]  We're talking about job losses.
[00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:41.582]  We're talking about lots of income loss.
[00:19:41.582 --> 00:19:45.364]  We're talking about product stuck in warehouses that cannot be sold.
[00:19:45.364 --> 00:19:46.725]  What about freedom of choice?
[00:19:47.765 --> 00:19:51.427]  See, they're gonna make vitamins and minerals and everything just like drugs.
[00:19:51.427 --> 00:19:57.291]  I saw a story like four years ago where they SWAT teamed an aloe vera farm saying it was drugs.
[00:19:57.291 --> 00:19:58.672]  Oh yeah, they're just getting started.
[00:19:58.672 --> 00:20:00.793]  Stay with us, we'll tell you all about it.
[00:20:00.793 --> 00:20:04.355]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:20:04.355 --> 00:20:06.637]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:20:06.637 --> 00:20:07.517]  Don't!
[00:20:07.517 --> 00:20:10.519]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:16.463]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:20:34.594 --> 00:20:35.774]  Herb K. was right.
[00:20:35.774 --> 00:20:38.975]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:20:38.975 --> 00:20:40.336]  What have you got to lose?
[00:20:40.336 --> 00:20:44.037]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:20:44.037 --> 00:20:44.657]  Get Herb K.'

[00:22:01.906 --> 00:22:05.936]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.936 --> 00:22:09.184]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:09.184 --> 00:22:10.587]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:22:11.286 --> 00:22:14.327]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:14.327 --> 00:22:20.348]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.348 --> 00:22:25.530]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:35.532]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.652 --> 00:22:37.994]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.994 --> 00:22:39.595]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.595 --> 00:22:42.037]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:42.037 --> 00:22:44.179]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:49.323]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:23:03.948 --> 00:23:07.851]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:23:07.851 --> 00:23:11.574]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:19.419]  I think so.

[00:24:30.126 --> 00:24:30.587]  Central.
[00:24:30.587 --> 00:24:33.429]  We're here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:35.230]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.432]  Big announcement coming up in the third hour today.
[00:24:45.219 --> 00:24:52.941]  Continuing from the National Post, stop selling unlicensed natural health remedies.
[00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:55.222]  The health food stores, the pharmacies are told.
[00:24:55.222 --> 00:25:04.384]  In a statement issued by the association, calls for the directive of self-serving and contrary to federal government policy.
[00:25:04.384 --> 00:25:07.365]  It has taken a sledgehammer to a finishing nail, the group said.
[00:25:07.365 --> 00:25:10.706]  It will create confusion for consumers.
[00:25:10.706 --> 00:25:12.146]  It is the wrong thing to do.
[00:25:14.619 --> 00:25:25.186]  And it goes on to say that they're going to start going after many body-selling vitamins or nutrients or alternative treatments.
[00:25:25.186 --> 00:25:30.330]  You only have the choice to have the chemotherapy if you have cancer.
[00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:35.033]  You only have the choice... If you want to fly, you got to go to the radiating machines.
[00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:43.159]  If you want to... Again, they're just building this box, this vice grip, these clamps around our throats.
[00:25:48.379 --> 00:25:50.840]  And it's the same thing in the United States.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.160]  U.S.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.140]  government plans new climate service.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:54.421]  U.S.
[00:25:54.421 --> 00:26:09.124]  President Barack Obama administration announced plans today for a new office handling climate change, aiming to help businesses chart future plans as the nation shifts to a greener economy.
[00:26:09.124 --> 00:26:10.645]  But it's not a greener economy.
[00:26:10.645 --> 00:26:12.225]  It's a takeover of our economy.
[00:26:13.442 --> 00:26:17.625]  Where they can decide who can have a business and who can't, just like when they took over the automakers.
[00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:20.106]  They decided who could keep their dealership and who couldn't.
[00:26:20.106 --> 00:26:21.267]  The White House did.
[00:26:21.267 --> 00:26:23.028]  Oh, are they big contributors to the Democrats?
[00:26:23.028 --> 00:26:25.029]  Oh, they can stay open!
[00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:38.838]  The first practical effect was the creation of a website, climate.gov, which came online Monday and brings together government resources on climate change for businesses, scholars, and the general public.
[00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:53.089]  Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said the new climate service would help businesses on subjects such as wind power by providing data on wind patterns which they would need to expand.
[00:26:53.089 --> 00:27:09.823]  The bottom line is this, the better climate information that alternative energy companies have, the more profitable they can be, the more jobs they can create, and the more that they can actually meet the energy demands of our country and indeed the world.
[00:27:11.072 --> 00:27:19.880]  He told reporters, yes, not letting us have coal plants will certainly help our economy when China's firing up three or four of them a week.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:26.827]  Yes, going in and adding new layers of bureaucracy and controlling everybody's lives and all these new taxes, 2.6 billion in three years in Austin alone.
[00:27:26.827 --> 00:27:28.388]  That's Austin Energy.
[00:27:28.388 --> 00:27:29.930]  Oh, that'll certainly help the economy.
[00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:41.818]  Locke compared the initiative to the National Weather Service, which he said had spurred a private industry of forecasters who benefit from the government data.
[00:27:41.818 --> 00:27:46.602]  No, this won't be scientific Doppler radar.
[00:27:46.602 --> 00:27:53.449]  This will be the White House organizing more fraud, just like the IPCC and the UN.
[00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:57.254]  And this is the agreement from Copenhagen.
[00:27:57.254 --> 00:28:10.076]  When they couldn't get the treaty, they said the US, England, and the European Union will start collecting carbon data and will start the taxes and will pay it to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:28:10.076 --> 00:28:16.858]  You can't get Congress to pass it, so he'll just tell the EPA to start the taxes on carbon dioxide.
[00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:22.609]  But when you hear it on the news, it's, oh, Obama's got a plan for some new jobs for ya!
[00:28:22.609 --> 00:28:40.179]  It's gonna be a home inspection, and your gas bill, and your water bill, and your gasoline bill are all gonna go up, and there's gonna be all these new fines and fees on businesses, and all these new green police that they've got being dispatched all over the country, and we're gonna inspect your farm and ranch, and gonna tell you what you can and can't do.
[00:28:40.179 --> 00:28:40.840]  Isn't that great?
[00:28:42.756 --> 00:28:45.297]  And they're not just saying water above ground, a puddle of water.
[00:28:45.297 --> 00:28:51.340]  They're saying if you have any water below ground, they're going to regulate your property, which almost everybody's got water below ground.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:57.283]  There's a water table everywhere.
[00:28:57.283 --> 00:28:57.863]  It's incredible.
[00:29:00.011 --> 00:29:10.459]  The Climate Service will bring together resources now spread throughout the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who's been caught in all the fraud, along with NASA, an agency that falls under the Commerce Department.
[00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:13.001]  It will also have six regional offices across the country.
[00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.422]  Oh boy!
[00:29:14.422 --> 00:29:20.646]  Locke said he expected that the Climate Service would be running before the start of 2011, a year from now.
[00:29:20.646 --> 00:29:21.387]  Or less than a year.
[00:29:21.387 --> 00:29:26.651]  He said the administration would first consult with Congress, although he did not believe any new legislation was needed.
[00:29:28.234 --> 00:29:29.095]  Yes!
[00:29:29.095 --> 00:29:32.117]  You know, they don't need any stinking legislation.
[00:29:32.117 --> 00:29:37.061]  Kind of like they already built the cyber security takeover system and now they pass it to the House.
[00:29:37.061 --> 00:29:44.046]  Or like they passed laws for warrantless wiretapping decades after they started it.
[00:29:44.046 --> 00:29:44.907]  Well, this is big.
[00:29:44.907 --> 00:29:48.570]  Drudge Report has linked to Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:49.310]  This is incredible.
[00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.052]  Watson called me at 6am.
[00:29:51.052 --> 00:29:52.453]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.453 --> 00:29:54.975]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.975 --> 00:29:57.677]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.421 --> 00:30:04.526]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:07.389]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.492]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:30:09.492 --> 00:30:11.735]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:30:11.735 --> 00:30:13.397]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:31:02.088 --> 00:31:06.110]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.351]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.351 --> 00:31:10.752]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:11.477 --> 00:31:14.140]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:20.545]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:25.730]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:35.719]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.839 --> 00:31:38.181]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.181 --> 00:31:39.762]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.762 --> 00:31:42.224]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.224 --> 00:31:44.346]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.346 --> 00:31:49.510]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:58.617]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:00.749 --> 00:32:03.170]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:07.013]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[00:32:07.013 --> 00:32:10.615]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[00:32:10.615 --> 00:32:14.617]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[00:32:14.617 --> 00:32:18.439]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco and experience
[00:32:19.787 --> 00:32:20.707]  Smoking Freedom.
[00:32:20.707 --> 00:32:29.889]  PowerVapor.com is an e-cigarette with the look, feel, and smoke of a real cigarette, but with no tar, no carbon monoxide, and no bad odors.

[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.403]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[00:33:01.403 --> 00:33:04.165]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:33:04.165 --> 00:33:11.990]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:16.293]  Well, you know, about a month and a half ago, Drugs put a permanent link to Infowars.com up.
[00:33:19.409 --> 00:33:24.672]  And now he has on his front page a red link.
[00:33:24.672 --> 00:33:36.398]  And the reason Drudge is so important, he's not only the number one alternative news blog website in the world, every other news agency will now pick this up.
[00:33:36.398 --> 00:33:42.802]  Until about four years ago, the New York Times was the main publication that everybody else decided what to report on from.
[00:33:42.802 --> 00:33:44.803]  Kind of set the agenda.
[00:33:44.803 --> 00:33:46.364]  Now it's the Drudge Report.
[00:33:48.584 --> 00:33:53.348]  And I tell you, I have saluted Matt Drudge.
[00:33:53.348 --> 00:34:03.035]  He hasn't been perfect over the years, but now, when we go to the Drudge Report, and I've been saying this for the last year, it's like it's PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:34:03.035 --> 00:34:09.120]  Every time the globalists call for world government, he puts videos up of world leaders saying it and the mainstream news articles.
[00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:16.830]  He talks about the police state, troops on the streets, the snatch and grab by U.S.
[00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.510]  military at the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.951]  I mean, it's really good!
[00:34:22.951 --> 00:34:28.712]  He has totally shifted into an anti-New World Order position, and this is exciting.
[00:34:28.712 --> 00:34:30.313]  We are becoming the mainstream.
[00:34:30.313 --> 00:34:31.853]  We are taking America back.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.642]  And I just want to salute Matt Drudge for what he's doing because this is big.
[00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:48.585]  Watson at about 6.30 this morning knew I was already up because he saw me on the IM sending out dispatches to my different webmasters of what I wanted written and posted.
[00:34:48.585 --> 00:34:58.389]  I collaborate every morning with Kurt and mainly with Paul Watson on points I want made and of course they always have their own analysis and breakdown.
[00:35:00.032 --> 00:35:08.697]  And Watson said, this is huge, because we know they're recording it, we know they're getting a biometric scan with the naked body scanners, and we're going to beat these things.
[00:35:08.697 --> 00:35:09.097]  Together.
[00:35:10.885 --> 00:35:13.786]  And Drudge really hates the naked body scanners.
[00:35:13.786 --> 00:35:16.387]  And so I want to bring Paul Watson up and then let him go.
[00:35:16.387 --> 00:35:22.629]  We are seeing a traffic spike of biblical proportions right now from the Drudge report.
[00:35:22.629 --> 00:35:28.931]  Exposed naked body scanner images of film star printed circulated by airport staff.
[00:35:28.931 --> 00:35:33.753]  And I already had Watson coming up before showtime at 1130 to talk about this briefly.
[00:35:33.753 --> 00:35:36.814]  But now we've got this Drudge red link.
[00:35:36.814 --> 00:35:37.094]  Folks,
[00:35:37.794 --> 00:35:40.676]  Drudge, maybe once a week, red links something.
[00:35:40.676 --> 00:35:45.419]  I mean, this is, when he red links something, it is going supernova.
[00:35:45.419 --> 00:36:00.749]  Great job to everybody out there, because once people know they're really recording this, which they admit they're doing internally, and government documents have come out, we've written about that, make sure that's all added, Watson, that the fact that three weeks ago they admitted they're actually recording it, and that's being put in a database.
[00:36:00.749 --> 00:36:07.394]  Once the public knows this, and once they understand it violates child porn laws worldwide, we're going to beat these things together.
[00:36:08.615 --> 00:36:13.940]  And so now Paul Watson with his powerful article that he's going to be beefing now that it's gone supernova.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:26.413]  He's already written three articles today talking about a workhorse, a Clydesdale, pulling giant wagons of coal to be thrown in the furnaces of liberty every day out of the black mine.
[00:36:26.413 --> 00:36:28.295]  Oh, I love it.
[00:36:28.295 --> 00:36:29.657]  Watson, good to have you here with us.
[00:36:32.389 --> 00:36:37.232]  Well, my Clydesdale, it's another huge torpedo attack on the enemy.
[00:36:37.232 --> 00:36:39.753]  Tell us about the article.
[00:36:39.753 --> 00:36:42.375]  Well, I thought it would get big, Alex.
[00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:44.016]  I actually wrote it yesterday.
[00:36:44.016 --> 00:36:48.038]  I wanted to release it earlier today to give it the best impact.
[00:36:48.038 --> 00:36:55.343]  Because only a week ago, the UK Transport Secretary, Lord Adonis, promised
[00:36:56.164 --> 00:37:03.026]  Guaranteed that these naked body scanner images were deleted instantly.
[00:37:03.026 --> 00:37:09.509]  And also we were told, we were promised that the person going through them couldn't be identified.
[00:37:09.509 --> 00:37:13.770]  And of course this completely demolishes that as a total fraud.
[00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:24.234]  Because on a BBC chat show on Friday night and these comments were reported but the, you know, the gravitas of them wasn't understood.
[00:37:25.481 --> 00:37:50.818]  This Indian film star said that he went through a naked body scanner at Heathrow and after a few minutes when he got through it he said that girls and I mean that could only mean airport security staff had printed out the images of his naked body because he said he thought they were handing him some forms to sign or something but they handed him
[00:37:51.894 --> 00:37:55.137]  The printout of the naked image of his body.
[00:37:55.137 --> 00:37:58.699]  And he says it shows everything, it shows the outline of your body.
[00:37:58.699 --> 00:38:04.364]  And he said that, um, you would be embarrassed if you're not well endowed.
[00:38:04.364 --> 00:38:17.394]  Because obviously as we've reported before, and as has been admitted, in the light of lies that it doesn't, these body scanner images show full details, crisp details of genitalia.
[00:38:18.157 --> 00:38:25.561]  So these airport security staff at Heathrow were printing out the images of him, handing them around and ogling them.
[00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:29.703]  And these are the same people who are going to be dealing with the images of your naked children.
[00:38:29.703 --> 00:38:34.746]  But that's been separately reported by our listeners and other journalists and on the news.
[00:38:34.746 --> 00:38:41.910]  And you even see the photos of men smiling in mainstream photos, in mainstream papers, looking at good-looking women.
[00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:48.814]  And they admittedly are always grabbing women's breasts and humiliating them and having their way with them.
[00:38:48.814 --> 00:38:50.776]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:38:50.776 --> 00:38:54.098]  This is a way to make us submit to tyranny.
[00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:57.060]  This is a way to break our resolve, break our will.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.741]  They're recording our naked bodies.
[00:38:58.741 --> 00:39:00.863]  It is a biometric scan.
[00:39:00.863 --> 00:39:08.308]  Add all of that to the bottom of the article, Watson, and all the other great articles you've written, because we can really educate millions of people today
[00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:10.649]  Yeah, well the key about it is that
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.921]  If they get these things in the airport, which they've got them in certain airports already.
[00:39:43.921 --> 00:39:47.461]  Australia just announced widespread introduction.
[00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:53.562]  Obama's set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for their introduction in every major US airport.
[00:39:53.562 --> 00:39:56.923]  If they get it in the airport, they're going to put it on the street.
[00:39:56.923 --> 00:39:58.223]  And that's been admitted.
[00:39:58.223 --> 00:40:08.765]  The Home Office has already proposed putting these body scanners, a scaled down version of it, on the street to scan your naked body as you walk past a lamppost.
[00:40:09.631 --> 00:40:19.601]  Dutch authorities, Dutch police have announced that they're going to use mobile versions of this for quote mass scans on crowds at events such as football matches.
[00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:30.132]  You know, I was in Shanghai earlier this year and to get into any museum or there was even a place that was like a model of the city inside this building and you had to go in.
[00:40:30.592 --> 00:40:32.853]  Well, we already have courthouses doing it here in the US!
[00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:47.253]  Exactly.
[00:40:47.253 --> 00:40:50.057]  People think, oh, I can just avoid this by not flying.
[00:40:50.057 --> 00:40:50.978]  I'm afraid not.
[00:40:50.978 --> 00:40:55.223]  It's going to be around the corner from where you live if you don't resist it now.
[00:40:55.223 --> 00:41:04.294]  And by the way, first the British government said you can opt for the pat-down, but now they're saying, no, you will go through the naked body scanner and everyone's going to go through it.
[00:41:04.614 --> 00:41:06.514]  Right, and if you refuse, you're treated like a terrorist.
[00:41:06.514 --> 00:41:07.415]  You don't play.
[00:41:07.415 --> 00:41:11.135]  Now, there's another article we put out today, which is out of the Huffington Post.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.141]  Where a woman has breast implants.
[00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:38.503]  And we read all these ridiculous articles and editorials.
[00:41:38.503 --> 00:41:39.743]  And they groped her breast!
[00:41:39.743 --> 00:41:41.104]  They groped her breast!
[00:41:41.104 --> 00:41:41.224]  Yeah.
[00:41:41.224 --> 00:41:45.686]  But these editorials said, oh, it gives you more privacy than a pat-down.
[00:41:45.686 --> 00:41:50.068]  If there's anything in the least bit suspicious, they grope you anyway.
[00:41:50.068 --> 00:41:53.950]  And it shows colostomy bags, breast implants, everything.
[00:41:57.375 --> 00:42:11.677]  Not to mention the radiation dangers, which the Interagency Committee on Radiation Safety, the biggest organization that studies this kind of thing in the world, said that it's dangerous and pregnant women and children should not be made to go through it.
[00:42:12.179 --> 00:42:29.461]  Well, Paul, beef the article with the radiation danger, with the child porn law information, and more, because we've got a chance to educate millions and millions of new people today with this, and we're just so thankful that the listeners continue to take our articles and put them out at the four winds.
[00:42:30.402 --> 00:42:44.948]  And again, that's why COINTELPRO is coming out of the woodwork, trying to demonize us with the activist community, because they know if people imitate what we've done, and really take action, we can bring down this New World Order.
[00:42:44.948 --> 00:42:46.729]  It is not invincible.
[00:42:46.729 --> 00:42:51.651]  No one, literally 99% of the public, do not want to go through these naked body scanners.
[00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:54.592]  People do not want to be part of this tyranny.
[00:42:54.592 --> 00:42:56.653]  And we need to
[00:42:58.197 --> 00:43:01.538]  Really press this issue, because if they can get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[00:43:01.538 --> 00:43:09.200]  As I predicted, on the 27th of December, two days after the underwear bombing, that it would be a staged event.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:21.183]  Of course it came out it was, and the State Department, under intelligence agency orders, this is Detroit News, ordered him to be allowed on the plane without passport or ID, and some security official brought him on board, and that's all come out and more.
[00:43:22.163 --> 00:43:34.365]  And we pointed out on the 27th as well that next they're going to want chest x-rays, four hidden bombs in the stomach or breast, and now that's the London Telegraph, the London Guardian, the Associated Press.
[00:43:34.365 --> 00:43:36.826]  They are going to set the precedent to radiate you.
[00:43:36.826 --> 00:43:41.526]  I mean, they already make the troops breathe DU that kills them dead in a hammer in just a few years.
[00:43:41.526 --> 00:43:44.867]  They already make the troops take experimental vaccines that kill them.
[00:43:44.867 --> 00:43:49.188]  This is the New World Order's religion, killing you with soft kill weapons.
[00:43:51.027 --> 00:43:57.473]  Down the road, I've got an MSNBC article that is so nightmarish it makes me physically ill today.
[00:43:57.473 --> 00:44:02.998]  It says 9-1-1 health lawsuits raise credibility concerns.
[00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:08.323]  So, 9-11 health lawsuits raise credibility concerns.
[00:44:08.323 --> 00:44:12.906]  AP investigation finds inconsistent claims about sickness from ground zero.
[00:44:12.906 --> 00:44:20.391]  I mean, seven years ago, they had the Mayo Clinic.
[00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.032]  They had all the other big clinics.
[00:44:23.976 --> 00:44:47.266]  And just scores of them, the big, famous New York medical facilities, Minnesota, California, Mount Sinai, the list went on and on, about how their lungs were filled with concrete, pulverized glass, and asbestos, and mercury from the hundreds of thousands of mercury-switched thermostats and computers, because it was just atomized with the explosives.
[00:44:47.266 --> 00:44:48.587]  The government said it was safe,
[00:44:49.267 --> 00:44:53.950]  It came out that they knew it wasn't safe and lied to everybody.
[00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:58.092]  That's the EPA's own internal documents, Christina Todd Whitman.
[00:44:58.092 --> 00:45:01.874]  And now the AP comes out and says, oh, we've done an investigation.
[00:45:01.874 --> 00:45:03.195]  This is all fake.
[00:45:03.195 --> 00:45:06.777]  None of these firefighters and police and medical workers are sick.
[00:45:06.777 --> 00:45:15.482]  None of these National Guardsmen are really sick, even though all, within four years, all the dogs that were there, of hundreds, died of cancer.
[00:45:17.321 --> 00:45:20.905]  It's now 3,000 plus of the medical people have died.
[00:45:20.905 --> 00:45:22.187]  I mean, are they faking dying?
[00:45:22.187 --> 00:45:32.359]  I've been there with the firefighters and police when they go, excuse me, and they're sitting there with an oxygen tank and they can't even go on stage and give a speech and start coughing up blood and get put in an ambulance outside.
[00:45:32.359 --> 00:45:33.320]  But no!
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.001]  It's not real!
[00:45:34.001 --> 00:45:37.385]  Just like all these fake reports about this British doctor, you know,
[00:45:37.765 --> 00:45:45.529]  Well, the Lancet took it out, his findings of autism and mercury, in the shots, and he hasn't taken back what he said.
[00:45:45.529 --> 00:45:46.830]  It's all a hoax.
[00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.072]  They're hoaxing and saying vaccines aren't hurting you.
[00:45:50.072 --> 00:45:56.535]  They're hoaxing and saying that the 9-11 heroes aren't sick.
[00:45:56.535 --> 00:45:59.597]  And they're hoaxing and saying they're not recording your naked bodies, Paul.
[00:46:01.431 --> 00:46:06.936]  Well, I mean the AP did an investigation and said that Climategate was no big deal.
[00:46:06.936 --> 00:46:10.560]  They tried to squash it a couple of weeks after it came out.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.401]  Didn't work.
[00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:15.064]  It's completely blown out of all proportion now into a massive scandal.
[00:46:16.318 --> 00:46:26.966]  There's GlacierGate, there's AfriGate, there's PachariGate, there's every major government facility caught in internal memos organizing the fraud.
[00:46:26.966 --> 00:46:34.492]  I mean, fraud's coming out on a daily basis, I exaggerate not, folks, bigger than the emails with the head UN scientist caught red-handed.
[00:46:34.492 --> 00:46:39.776]  Ben Santer, interviewed by Jesse Ventura, admits they took out the five scientists in their 96 report.
[00:46:40.777 --> 00:46:42.277]  Saying man didn't contribute.
[00:46:42.277 --> 00:46:43.577]  It's all fake!
[00:46:43.577 --> 00:46:45.898]  But AP says no, no, no.
[00:46:45.898 --> 00:46:51.059]  I've got The Economist magazine this week's issue saying it's all real, Paul.
[00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:53.339]  Climategate's a hoax, Paul.
[00:46:53.339 --> 00:46:54.759]  It doesn't matter, Paul.
[00:46:54.759 --> 00:46:55.820]  But see, no.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:58.260]  You guys are losing all your credibility.
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.040]  That's why you can't get subscribers.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.841]  All these big news services are going to subscriber.
[00:47:02.841 --> 00:47:06.481]  New York Daily News got 35 subscribers in three months.
[00:47:06.481 --> 00:47:08.122]  No one likes you.
[00:47:08.122 --> 00:47:09.982]  Everyone knows you're liars, Watson.
[00:47:11.343 --> 00:47:18.186]  Well, the more they act as apologists for all this, for the terror-industrial complex, the more credibility they lose, as you said.
[00:47:18.186 --> 00:47:30.511]  I mean, Time Magazine jumping on the bandwagon with the internet licensing, their subscriptions, their street sales are way down, the mainstream dinosaur's dying, and it's about time it happened.
[00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:36.885]  Now, the people that will be left will be those that have at least given an avenue to the truth.
[00:47:36.885 --> 00:47:39.987]  I mean, Drudge understands that, and that's why he post-asked us.
[00:48:02.343 --> 00:48:04.026]  That's what they're planning for.
[00:48:04.026 --> 00:48:07.110]  I mean, they've overreached again.
[00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:12.338]  I mean, internet licensing was rejected even by Communist China.
[00:48:13.188 --> 00:48:24.337]  Yeah, they just use filters, but Microsoft, the UN, Time Magazine, Newsweek, and we've got links in this video, the 10-minute video we put out in the early morning hours today.
[00:48:24.337 --> 00:48:35.667]  It's an excellent 10-minute because every claim I say, I show you their own articles where they are calling for registering and thumbprinting to get online to use your iPhone, anything.
[00:48:37.992 --> 00:48:43.918]  Exactly, and I mean in... And now everything, everything with buying and selling is on the web, so that's the mark of the beast!
[00:48:43.918 --> 00:48:47.401]  You've got a thumbprint to buy and sell!
[00:48:47.401 --> 00:48:55.889]  Well, it's amazing that in so-called democratic countries, prison planet and info wars are censored far more than they are in communist China.
[00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:02.133]  I've been to China twice in the past two years and the Prison Planet infos are available in China.
[00:49:02.133 --> 00:49:05.614]  They're still available, but not in New Zealand.
[00:49:05.614 --> 00:49:12.058]  And occasionally, you know, ISPs like Time Warner will knock us out for a while until people complain.
[00:49:12.058 --> 00:49:16.640]  And it just shows them up for the authoritarian stooges that they are.
[00:49:18.905 --> 00:49:23.389]  Well, Drudge knows the writing on the wall, and he's choosing wisely.
[00:49:23.389 --> 00:49:26.811]  Because to all the police, to all the military, you got a choice, okay?
[00:49:26.811 --> 00:49:28.012]  And that's why I'm here.
[00:49:28.012 --> 00:49:30.014]  I believe that's why God put me in the position I'm in.
[00:49:30.014 --> 00:49:31.896]  I never intended for any of this to happen.
[00:49:31.896 --> 00:49:36.179]  I'm here to tell you the truth, so you have a choice with your conscience.
[00:49:36.179 --> 00:49:37.900]  Because eternity is what matters.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.262]  These little earth suits mean nothing.
[00:49:40.262 --> 00:49:41.543]  Your body means nothing, folks.
[00:49:41.543 --> 00:49:42.844]  We are eternal beings.
[00:49:42.844 --> 00:49:45.567]  And that's why the hair on the back of your neck standing right up.
[00:49:46.047 --> 00:49:53.092]  Standing up right now, CIA agents listening, police, FBI, government people that have served evil, you've still got a soul left.
[00:49:53.092 --> 00:49:58.275]  And that's why the hair on the back of your neck standing up right now, because the Holy Spirit is talking to you.
[00:49:58.275 --> 00:50:06.880]  And don't blaspheme it, accept it, hit your knees like Saul of Tarsus, repent, and become great champions for freedom.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:12.324]  I'm telling you, you have been warned, you have been given the choice, choose a side!
[00:50:12.324 --> 00:50:13.665]  Make a decision, Watson!
[00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:16.950]  And the fact is, we're having victories.
[00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:22.493]  Swine flu, I mean, they wanted 99% of the population to take that shot.
[00:50:22.493 --> 00:50:25.994]  In countries like Germany and France, barely 7% took it.
[00:50:25.994 --> 00:50:27.755]  It was a total failure.
[00:50:27.755 --> 00:50:30.817]  Climategate, global warming, scams exploding.
[00:50:31.557 --> 00:50:35.640]  And now we need to do the same with these body scanners by getting this article out.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:35.981]  Watson!
[00:50:35.981 --> 00:50:36.461]  Watson!
[00:50:36.461 --> 00:50:38.903]  And avoiding them from putting them on the street.
[00:50:38.903 --> 00:50:39.623]  Absolutely.
[00:50:39.623 --> 00:50:46.949]  Watson, beef the article with all the info on the cancer, the radiation, how it violates laws.
[00:50:46.949 --> 00:50:48.190]  Beef it up right now.
[00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.952]  Well done over at Prison Planet, my friend.
[00:50:50.952 --> 00:50:52.433]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:50:52.433 --> 00:50:53.974]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:53.974 --> 00:50:54.855]  Stay with us.
[00:50:54.855 --> 00:50:57.277]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:57.277 --> 00:50:59.478]  We'll take calls the next two segments, then we'll go to our guest.
[00:50:59.478 --> 00:50:59.839]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.508 --> 00:51:03.669]  Is your computer running slowly?

[00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:06.226]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.226 --> 00:52:09.472]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.472 --> 00:52:10.895]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.796 --> 00:52:14.257]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.257 --> 00:52:20.658]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.658 --> 00:52:25.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:35.822]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.942 --> 00:52:38.284]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.284 --> 00:52:39.886]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.886 --> 00:52:42.348]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.348 --> 00:52:44.471]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.471 --> 00:52:49.636]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.636 --> 00:52:58.745]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:53:30.149 --> 00:53:39.475]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:53:39.475 --> 00:53:46.540]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.421]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:53:47.421 --> 00:53:50.663]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:53:50.663 --> 00:53:51.463]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:53:51.463 --> 00:53:52.544]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:53:52.544 --> 00:53:52.864]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:53:52.864 --> 00:53:53.224]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:54:00.029 --> 00:54:08.874]  About two years ago we had Dr. William J. Hersey on.
[00:54:08.874 --> 00:54:10.695]  He headed up
[00:54:20.683 --> 00:54:26.588]  An entire department of the EPA, chemistry department chair at American University in Washington, D.C.
[00:54:26.588 --> 00:54:32.173]  Dr. Hersey is a chemist and residence for the College of Arts and Science, chemistry department.
[00:54:32.173 --> 00:54:33.875]  He has a B.S.
[00:54:33.875 --> 00:54:34.315]  and Ph.D.
[00:54:34.315 --> 00:54:36.077]  in chemistry from the University of Missouri.
[00:54:36.077 --> 00:54:41.081]  In 2000, he testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Wildlife, Fisheries, and Drinking Water.
[00:54:41.081 --> 00:54:47.507]  And the majority, it was over 90% of EPA scientists and toxicologists sent a letter
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:55.525]  A petition to the EPA, they did it in 1999 and again in 2004, saying this is deadly poison what's being put in the water.
[00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.326]  And it's a cumulative toxin.
[00:54:57.326 --> 00:54:58.307]  We have a problem, though.
[00:54:58.307 --> 00:55:04.191]  We were supposed to talk to him from the university today, but they are literally in 12 feet of snow in DC.
[00:55:04.191 --> 00:55:12.237]  As you know, much of the eastern area of the country is just buried right now, and the university's closed.
[00:55:13.288 --> 00:55:15.470]  But he may have come into the blizzard to do it.
[00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:17.632]  If not, he'll be on next week or something.
[00:55:17.632 --> 00:55:24.639]  And I'm not glad this happened, but I'm kind of glad because we've got so much going on with the naked body scanners, recording your body, saving it.
[00:55:24.639 --> 00:55:27.461]  We have so much going on on the cybersecurity takeover.
[00:55:27.461 --> 00:55:32.126]  And I want to take your calls, but we'll see what happens with the good doctor.
[00:55:33.493 --> 00:55:46.179]  Wayne Madsen's also in D.C., and yesterday we were trying to call him to double confirm he was on today, and the phone was out for most of the day, and he said because shell towers are collapsing, they're down, he's in D.C.
[00:55:46.179 --> 00:55:54.202]  too, so who knows if he'll be on today because of all this global warming, this blizzard that they're all under in D.C.
[00:55:54.202 --> 00:55:55.983]  right now.
[00:55:55.983 --> 00:56:02.766]  Oh my God, and we see all these cases the last few months of people in Detroit, you name it, freezing to death when the government turns their power off.
[00:56:04.013 --> 00:56:11.342]  Under the climate taxes, which will conservatively double your energy prices in the next five years, it'll be even more freezing to death, but I guess that makes the globalist happy.
[00:56:14.324 --> 00:56:21.709]  Even if they shut the web down, ladies and gentlemen, that's why I've always told you our entire library of documentary films and books are vital.
[00:56:21.709 --> 00:56:31.295]  You will always be able to make a copy of Fall of the Republic, or Endgame, or Obama Deception, or Terror Storm, or Truth Rising, or Fabled Enemies.
[00:56:31.295 --> 00:56:33.077]  You will always be able to give it to people.
[00:56:33.077 --> 00:56:38.160]  They're professionally produced, they're riveting, and they unlock people's minds.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:42.923]  Get the DVDs at InfoWars.com on the secure online video bookstore.
[00:56:44.824 --> 00:57:00.754]  Six, eight months ago with the Joker situation, the Obama Joker, hundreds of TV stations, hundreds of newspapers, no exaggeration, Japan, England, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Argentina, the power of just putting up handbills.
[00:57:00.754 --> 00:57:06.518]  And so, and I know I keep saying I'm going to launch that contest, we are going to have it, I am just so overwhelmed 24-7.
[00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:10.590]  And I guess I just can't go home tonight.
[00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:13.874]  I've got to stay and write up those rules for the three different contests.
[00:57:13.874 --> 00:57:17.197]  I keep biting off more than I can chew, but I know you understand, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:17.197 --> 00:57:20.720]  We are in the middle of a revolution against tyranny right now.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:25.305]  And never forget, your financial support is absolutely vital for this show.
[00:57:25.305 --> 00:57:26.886]  And how do you support us?
[00:57:26.886 --> 00:57:31.131]  You buy the t-shirts, $9.95, ball caps, you know.
[00:57:32.984 --> 00:57:34.365]  You spread the word with them.
[00:57:34.365 --> 00:57:35.646]  You meet like-minded people.
[00:57:35.646 --> 00:57:37.168]  You buy the books, the videos.
[00:57:37.168 --> 00:57:39.349]  We've got deals where you get free t-shirts, free videos.
[00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:42.032]  We've slashed the prices down to almost nothing.
[00:57:42.032 --> 00:57:52.601]  You pre-order Jesse Ventura's book and get a free copy of Loose Change Final Cut or Aaron Russo Reflections and Warnings, my interview documentary I made about him.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.243]  Free!
[00:57:55.243 --> 00:57:58.448]  Infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:57:58.448 --> 00:57:58.488]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:10.731]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, the people are waking up.
[00:58:10.731 --> 00:58:14.752]  We're going to come back and go directly to your calls, as promised.
[00:58:14.752 --> 00:58:16.032]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:16.032 --> 00:58:19.773]  I'm very proud of our servers.
[00:58:19.773 --> 00:58:24.455]  Drudge has linked to us a couple times in the past and always crashed our servers and removed the link.
[00:58:24.455 --> 00:58:32.577]  That has not happened yet, though the Drudge effect is now in effect, because it isn't just going to be his millions of daily readers that are about to hit this article.
[00:58:33.277 --> 00:58:39.185]  Every other major site is now going to link and we are preparing for a tsunami of traffic.
[00:58:39.185 --> 00:58:41.268]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.268 --> 00:58:45.794]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:50.537 --> 00:58:55.081]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.081 --> 00:58:59.404]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.404 --> 00:59:05.169]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.169 --> 00:59:05.910]  It's true.
[00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:10.454]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.774 --> 00:59:11.595]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.595 --> 00:59:15.178]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.178 --> 00:59:19.101]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.101 --> 00:59:19.901]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:22.663]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.663 --> 00:59:26.346]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.346 --> 00:59:27.127]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.127 --> 00:59:31.270]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:36.034]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.314 --> 00:59:40.496]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.496 --> 00:59:42.277]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.277 --> 00:59:44.538]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.538 --> 00:59:46.819]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.819 --> 00:59:47.740]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:48.960]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.321]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.398]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.398 --> 01:00:10.159]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.159 --> 01:00:11.741]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:13.302]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.302 --> 01:00:17.486]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.486 --> 01:00:21.550]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.035 --> 01:00:43.655]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:43.655 --> 01:00:46.777]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:55.361]  And we're going to be live here for a further three hours.
[01:00:55.361 --> 01:01:02.065]  We are opening the phones up right now, and then I'm going to blitz through masses of vital news
[01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:09.512]  and information today.
[01:01:09.512 --> 01:01:15.354]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:01:15.354 --> 01:01:16.814]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[01:01:16.814 --> 01:01:19.295]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:01:19.295 --> 01:01:29.799]  Well, Alex, I woke up back in 1991 when I was on bullets and board systems, and they were loosely networked, and that's why I think we need to start getting back into
[01:01:30.652 --> 01:01:36.356]  ...is these networks that, you know, ultimately the information did come from the Internet that woke me up.
[01:01:36.356 --> 01:01:46.322]  But, you know, I woke up to things like the Federal Reserve and Ron Paul and other congressmen who have been trying for decades to end the Fed or the health tyranny or all these other things.
[01:01:46.322 --> 01:01:56.168]  I started out becoming aware and actually going to Republican and Democrat campaign offices to present them with some of this information and the silence was deafening.
[01:01:56.648 --> 01:02:12.197]  But I think, you know, as a backup, as an auxiliary plan, I know we want to keep the web, but if the government knows that we're going over to these other networks and these other structures, then maybe they'll think twice about, you know, playing a game of whack-a-mole with us.
[01:02:12.197 --> 01:02:21.262]  I mean, back then, I put out the national listing of BBSs, and then we'll have to put together a list of networks and bulletin board systems that we can call on the phone to access.
[01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:26.747]  And back in 1996, when I stopped the listing, I ended up with over 330.
[01:02:26.747 --> 01:02:34.269]  I can just imagine if people were to go back to that now, or if we were forced to, but it'd be a lot better than fax machines.
[01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:37.589]  And when it comes to Drudge, I mean, he's one of the people who helped wake me up, too.
[01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:46.611]  But, you know, he's again come full circle because he started becoming a propagandist, and now he's coming back to your information, so I want to congratulate you on that.
[01:02:46.611 --> 01:02:48.311]  Well, sir, I appreciate your call, Chris.
[01:02:48.311 --> 01:02:49.952]  Let me break something down, though.
[01:02:49.952 --> 01:02:50.692]  Here's the problem.
[01:02:52.302 --> 01:03:07.115]  Under cybersecurity, all IT infrastructures by law must be wired in to the Pentagon and the 15 plus giant cybersecurity facilities they've built or are building.
[01:03:07.115 --> 01:03:09.357]  Okay, I mean, these are gigantic facilities.
[01:03:09.357 --> 01:03:12.680]  Microsoft gets most of the big contracts.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.003]  I mean, it's $3 billion contract this year alone.
[01:03:16.003 --> 01:03:18.786]  $3 billion just to administer it.
[01:03:19.707 --> 01:03:21.147]  And that's only one layer of it.
[01:03:21.147 --> 01:03:23.348]  They've got private groups.
[01:03:23.348 --> 01:03:23.948]  It's all in there.
[01:03:23.948 --> 01:03:26.309]  I'm going to cover it coming up in the last hour today.
[01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:28.509]  And so you're not going to have your BBS systems.
[01:03:28.509 --> 01:03:31.530]  They're going to shut those down too.
[01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:32.470]  We have to hold them.
[01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:36.472]  We have to say no to their censorship and not just talk about ways around it.
[01:03:36.472 --> 01:03:37.712]  Separately, we need to as well.
[01:03:37.712 --> 01:03:39.992]  I agree with you, Chris.
[01:03:39.992 --> 01:03:41.633]  I've had a plan for several years.
[01:03:41.633 --> 01:03:45.374]  I just can only implement so much here because of funding and other issues.
[01:03:47.429 --> 01:04:02.233]  But I do plan, and I encourage others to do it, we're going to have like a paper where we can send somebody a file or even mail them a file on a disc or whatever of a newspaper with our stories, with places for you to put some of your stories locally if you want.
[01:04:02.233 --> 01:04:03.833]  We'll give you different versions.
[01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:09.515]  It'll have space for your ads, our ads will be placed, so you can just take it to a print shop and print
[01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:14.715]  The term tabloid doesn't mean like classic newspaper.
[01:04:14.715 --> 01:04:17.717]  It means a side fold sheet.
[01:04:17.717 --> 01:04:18.177]  You understand?
[01:04:18.177 --> 01:04:22.679]  So kind of a tabloid designed or shape.
[01:04:22.679 --> 01:04:23.579]  A smaller newspaper.
[01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:25.440]  Looks like a green sheet.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.161]  And I hope other people go out and do this.
[01:04:27.161 --> 01:04:30.302]  I mean, I'm not here like hoarding my ideas.
[01:04:30.302 --> 01:04:31.243]  It's mine!
[01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:31.303]  No!
[01:04:31.303 --> 01:04:35.184]  You know, I don't want anybody to know until I do it.
[01:04:35.184 --> 01:04:36.065]  Launch it!
[01:04:36.065 --> 01:04:37.646]  Everybody launch it!
[01:04:37.646 --> 01:04:38.406]  Do it yourselves!
[01:04:39.741 --> 01:04:47.684]  Because you can have one with national news and then everybody can get it in their cities and towns and have a section for local news and write about the New World Order in their area.
[01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:50.104]  And it's going to be devastating to the New World Order.
[01:04:50.104 --> 01:04:51.885]  It's going to be devastating!
[01:04:51.885 --> 01:04:55.406]  But it's going to take capital and probably five more people hired.
[01:04:55.406 --> 01:05:00.228]  So we've got to continue to try to raise the war chest here so we can wage war on the New World Order.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.382]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.382 --> 01:05:09.706]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.748]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.748 --> 01:05:16.751]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.751 --> 01:05:17.672]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.932 --> 01:05:19.053]  When do you want it?
[01:05:19.053 --> 01:05:20.934]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.934 --> 01:05:22.015]  When will you need it?
[01:05:22.015 --> 01:05:24.216]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:24.216 --> 01:05:25.557]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.557 --> 01:05:27.078]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:27.078 --> 01:05:32.342]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.342 --> 01:05:35.924]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.924 --> 01:05:39.407]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.747 --> 01:05:40.968]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.968 --> 01:05:41.869]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.869 --> 01:05:42.991]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.991 --> 01:05:43.912]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.912 --> 01:05:45.013]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:45.013 --> 01:05:48.056]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:07.339]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:06:07.339 --> 01:06:08.620]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.440]  It's very real.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.682]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:06:11.682 --> 01:06:13.344]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:17.807]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:07:00.074 --> 01:07:04.639]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.639 --> 01:07:08.964]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.964 --> 01:07:14.730]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:20.016]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:21.157]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.157 --> 01:07:24.739]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:28.662]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.662 --> 01:07:29.442]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.442 --> 01:07:32.204]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.204 --> 01:07:35.887]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.887 --> 01:07:36.127]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:40.809]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.809 --> 01:07:45.871]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:08:05.876 --> 01:08:10.719]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.280]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.862]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.862 --> 01:08:18.044]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.044 --> 01:08:23.188]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.188 --> 01:08:32.935]  We're now eight minutes into hour number two.
[01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:50.752]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to be going to your phone calls.
[01:08:52.369 --> 01:08:55.211]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:55.211 --> 01:09:11.920]  Man, I'm working on news stories, I'm working on videos, films, information during the breaks, and then as the bumper music plays, I'm like shouting orders into my intercom system while we go on air.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.801]  There's just too much happening, too much going on.
[01:09:15.482 --> 01:09:15.723]  U.S.
[01:09:15.723 --> 01:09:20.048]  government plans new climate service, an end run around Congress, that's coming up.
[01:09:20.048 --> 01:09:27.277]  They're moving to ban basically all over the counter vitamins, minerals, nutrients in Canada, that's in the National Post.
[01:09:27.277 --> 01:09:31.443]  Exposed naked body scanner images of film star printed, circulated by airport staff.
[01:09:31.843 --> 01:09:33.905]  That's the big PrisonPlanet.com top story.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.061]  Another New York Post article demonizing him.
[01:09:49.061 --> 01:09:50.442]  The outrage is just off the charts.
[01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:20.591]  Iran asked UN Atomic Body to oversee fuel production, but our media doesn't even report that.
[01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:23.654]  China hawks demand Cold War with the U.S.
[01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:24.995]  Times of London.
[01:10:24.995 --> 01:10:34.582]  So, they hold the majority of our debt, the largest portion of it, and have got all our weapon systems and everything we sell to Israel, they end up giving to China.
[01:10:34.582 --> 01:10:36.924]  That's even in the Jerusalem Post and Haaretz.
[01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:37.525]  And it doesn't matter.
[01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:38.326]  The real threat's Iran.
[01:10:38.326 --> 01:10:39.086]  We've got to attack them.
[01:10:39.086 --> 01:10:40.747]  Yeah, because they're somebody they think they can attack.
[01:10:41.688 --> 01:10:47.570]  Hillary says to China, vote for Iran's sanctions now or face Gulf confrontation and oil cut off.
[01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:49.730]  I mean, just incredible.
[01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:52.011]  Incredible stuff happening.
[01:10:52.011 --> 01:10:56.532]  Troops randomly patrol streets in Pittsburgh, respond to domestic disputes, regular U.S.
[01:10:56.532 --> 01:10:57.952]  Army and National Guard.
[01:10:57.952 --> 01:10:59.913]  Geithner lies in Bloomberg and says U.S.
[01:10:59.913 --> 01:11:06.074]  will never lose AAA debt rating, which has basically already happened unofficially.
[01:11:06.074 --> 01:11:09.355]  Rash of retirements pushes Social Security to the brink of bankruptcy.
[01:11:10.652 --> 01:11:11.492]  Another story here.
[01:11:11.492 --> 01:11:13.433]  Will Obama play the war card?
[01:11:13.433 --> 01:11:17.614]  Sarah Palin calls for it.
[01:11:17.614 --> 01:11:21.736]  Wall Street's now shifting the majority of their donations to Republicans when they had had the majority.
[01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.676]  Four to one to Obama and the Democrats.
[01:11:23.676 --> 01:11:26.157]  That's because they know the new party of power will be the Republicans.
[01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:28.358]  And then four years after that, they'll give the money to the Democrats.
[01:11:28.358 --> 01:11:30.659]  It's all staged, New York Times.
[01:11:30.659 --> 01:11:32.319]  So that's just some of the news there.
[01:11:32.319 --> 01:11:34.900]  New BlackBerry has spyware risk in it.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:37.401]  CNET News researcher reporting.
[01:11:38.615 --> 01:11:42.619]  That other key report, think the government's corrupt, you may face 10 years in jail.
[01:11:42.619 --> 01:11:48.964]  Another report out of American Chronicle, a devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah is on the horizon.
[01:11:48.964 --> 01:11:53.508]  A big article on the census despotism that's taking place.
[01:11:53.508 --> 01:11:55.931]  That's just some of the reports there.
[01:11:55.931 --> 01:11:59.634]  John McCain's daughter calls the Tea Party racist.
[01:11:59.634 --> 01:12:01.475]  It is all coming up.
[01:12:02.409 --> 01:12:03.049]  Today.
[01:12:03.049 --> 01:12:06.891]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:12:06.891 --> 01:12:08.411]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:14.914]  George, thanks for holding.
[01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:16.375]  Okay, let's move on.
[01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:17.715]  Michael in California.
[01:12:17.715 --> 01:12:19.896]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:12:19.896 --> 01:12:23.398]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:12:23.398 --> 01:12:31.541]  I'm calling today to talk about something that a friend and I, who is an independent researcher along with me, is finding here in Central California.
[01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:36.501]  That people need to start looking at sudden cardiac death.
[01:12:36.501 --> 01:12:42.624]  Sudden cardiac death is a diagnosis when doctors have no other idea why a heart stops.
[01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:48.507]  Well, a lot of times when they taser a 14-year-old and they die of a heart attack, they say, the taser had nothing to do with it.
[01:12:48.507 --> 01:12:50.107]  It was sudden cardiac death.
[01:12:50.107 --> 01:12:51.728]  Absolutely.
[01:12:51.728 --> 01:12:57.531]  And what we're finding here in California is that healthy, in-shape athletes
[01:12:58.243 --> 01:13:04.307]  Two high school students in the last 10 days have fallen over with sudden cardiac death.
[01:13:04.307 --> 01:13:05.688]  And I'll tell you what a lot of it is.
[01:13:05.688 --> 01:13:18.517]  It's a cocktail of toxins in our environment, but a lot of the studies show this is on the rise everywhere because GMO foods are causing autoimmune responses in the ventricles of the heart.
[01:13:18.517 --> 01:13:21.979]  And what we have done is we've set up an email account
[01:13:22.443 --> 01:13:27.926]  So that people can write us and tell us when they hear of this kind of thing happening.
[01:13:27.926 --> 01:13:30.848]  What we're looking for are newspaper articles.
[01:13:30.848 --> 01:13:32.428]  What newspaper did you hear in?
[01:13:32.428 --> 01:13:33.889]  Or what television station?
[01:13:33.889 --> 01:13:35.990]  Because we can't do statistical reporting.
[01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:39.272]  Well you can also search engine it, but go ahead and fire the email out.
[01:13:39.272 --> 01:13:40.813]  The email is R-E-S-E-A-R-C-H-E-S
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.241]  112 at yahoo.com.
[01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:49.702]  Alright, gotta jump, Michael.
[01:13:49.702 --> 01:14:00.626]  And I'm happy to take these calls, but, you know, we don't censor your calls, and I'm glad you called, but, and that's an interesting point you raised, but, I mean, is anybody concerned about the cybersecurity passing the House?
[01:14:00.626 --> 01:14:05.488]  Is anybody concerned about all the new net censorship going on and all the calls for it by government and industry?
[01:14:05.488 --> 01:14:08.989]  Is anybody concerned about the naked body scanners and your images being saved?
[01:14:08.989 --> 01:14:10.270]  Is anybody concerned about
[01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:12.191]  The economy.
[01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:19.035]  Is anybody concerned about states passing laws that if you basically criticize the government you can be arrested?
[01:14:19.035 --> 01:14:25.719]  I mean, is anybody concerned about what's going on?
[01:14:25.719 --> 01:14:28.221]  James in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:14:28.221 --> 01:14:31.443]  Hey Alex, I want to thank you for all your hard work.
[01:14:31.443 --> 01:14:33.424]  2009 was a great year.
[01:14:33.424 --> 01:14:35.586]  Obama deception was huge.
[01:14:35.586 --> 01:14:37.747]  Fall of the Republic, I just handed out two copies of it.
[01:14:38.638 --> 01:14:39.658]  Great stuff.
[01:14:39.658 --> 01:14:40.979]  20 minutes with the President.
[01:14:40.979 --> 01:14:41.899]  All great stuff.
[01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:42.760]  Keep up the good work.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.580]  I really appreciate it.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.941]  I know you're working a lot of hours.
[01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:48.562]  I had three questions for you.
[01:14:48.562 --> 01:14:54.064]  Why are the globalists still using the term New World Order when they know that there's a resistance to it?
[01:14:54.064 --> 01:15:01.847]  My second question is, would the globalists still have been able to pull off 9-11 if Gore would have won the election?
[01:15:01.847 --> 01:15:03.668]  And my third question is,
[01:15:04.665 --> 01:15:11.573]  What books and films, documentaries, would you recommend to learn about the founding fathers in the American Revolution?
[01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:12.033]  And that's it.
[01:15:12.033 --> 01:15:13.535]  I'll go ahead and hang up and let you answer.
[01:15:13.535 --> 01:15:16.358]  Okay, well, hold on a minute.
[01:15:16.358 --> 01:15:16.658]  Give me the...
[01:15:17.702 --> 01:15:19.263]  The first two questions again?
[01:15:19.263 --> 01:15:25.368]  Why are they still using the term New World Order, like Gordon Brown, Kissinger, when they know that there's a resistance to it?
[01:15:25.368 --> 01:15:28.110]  They wrote the Megiddo paper.
[01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:30.511]  And the other question was?
[01:15:30.511 --> 01:15:35.715]  Would they have still been able to pull off 9-11 without Cheney and the neocons in place?
[01:15:35.715 --> 01:15:39.098]  Say Gore had won because it was a close election and everything.
[01:15:39.098 --> 01:15:44.301]  Would they still, I know Gore's still a puppet, but would they have been able to pull it off without all their team in, in 2000?
[01:15:47.034 --> 01:15:48.455]  Okay, those are really good questions.
[01:15:48.455 --> 01:15:49.076]  I wrote them down.
[01:15:49.076 --> 01:15:50.937]  Thank you for the call.
[01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:55.861]  Let me try to succinctly answer the first question.
[01:15:55.861 --> 01:16:11.813]  For the last 50 years, we would have former Pentagon officers, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, CIA people, you name it, who were in the system, university professors, think tank operatives, senators, House members, British lords,
[01:16:12.952 --> 01:16:22.658]  They would be in these meetings where they would openly say, I mean I've got transcripts of the congressional record in 1954 where they had people testifying calling for world government.
[01:16:23.925 --> 01:16:29.469]  And so to build anything this big, it's got to be out in the open in the actual power structure.
[01:16:29.469 --> 01:16:31.150]  And in white papers and in think tanks.
[01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:32.872]  So it's never been a secret.
[01:16:32.872 --> 01:16:35.754]  And so people would come out and say, I'm against this.
[01:16:35.754 --> 01:16:41.538]  And if you talked about this in the 50s, they would poison you, they would kill you, they would imprison you, they would demonize you.
[01:16:41.538 --> 01:16:46.582]  I mean, because early on, and this is an embryonic phase, the establishment couldn't be exposed.
[01:16:47.262 --> 01:17:02.741]  But as they bankrupt societies, as they grew the size of government, as they got people on welfare, as they got people into the system, as they leveraged derivatives over the last half century, as the elite created more fiat currency and credit,
[01:17:03.442 --> 01:17:26.553]  Many times over than all the wealth in the world, they now believe they're very secure in their power and that they have a dumbed down population and now they're openly coming out with the global taxes paid to the IMF and World Bank, open world government power to the private banking cartel that in 1991 at a Bilderberg conference David Rockefeller called for, a global government for the administrative convenience of the international banking elite.
[01:17:26.553 --> 01:17:29.675]  Okay?
[01:17:29.675 --> 01:17:30.095]  And so
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:40.163]  They stalled everybody by saying it didn't exist and saying it's not kosher, it's not acceptable, it's kooky to talk about world government.
[01:17:40.163 --> 01:17:43.944]  Using peer pressure just to where people in polite conversation wouldn't discuss it.
[01:17:43.944 --> 01:17:46.826]  It was like passing gas in church or something.
[01:17:46.826 --> 01:17:47.866]  You're just not supposed to do it.
[01:17:49.764 --> 01:17:59.850]  But over the years, especially with the Internet, we've been successful at exposing the real system and exposing the fact that they were lying about it in their own documents, so they started losing a lot of credibility.
[01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:04.673]  And now they're so far along in their plan, they can't deny it anymore, so they come out and put a spin on it.
[01:18:04.673 --> 01:18:08.436]  They say, hey, global governance is good, it's going to save the Earth and save the polar bears and penguins.
[01:18:09.136 --> 01:18:10.217]  Hey, global government's good.
[01:18:10.217 --> 01:18:11.219]  It's going to help the third world.
[01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:13.642]  And it turns out they want to rip them off more.
[01:18:13.642 --> 01:18:16.104]  Global government is the only thing that's going to save our society.
[01:18:16.104 --> 01:18:17.326]  We've got to do it.
[01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:24.615]  And they have Miss America call for it, and all the different movies and TV shows have propaganda placement in it about how great it is and how we have to have it.
[01:18:27.048 --> 01:18:34.778]  But they simultaneously have such contempt for the public that they still say, world government doesn't exist, dangerous kooks, talk about it.
[01:18:34.778 --> 01:18:36.921]  The ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center and others.
[01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:42.208]  And they put out internal government reports saying anybody that talks about this is a nutty kook who wants to kill police.
[01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:44.191]  And they actually say that in the MIAC report.
[01:18:45.114 --> 01:18:46.815]  Because they think cops are dumb.
[01:18:46.815 --> 01:18:48.435]  None of this exists, officers.
[01:18:48.435 --> 01:18:50.116]  It's completely insane.
[01:18:50.116 --> 01:18:56.458]  These people want to get you, now drink your fluoride, eat your GMO corn, take your vaccine, officer.
[01:18:56.458 --> 01:19:00.059]  Use your DU, everything's fine.
[01:19:00.059 --> 01:19:09.882]  So they're still simultaneously saying none of it exists, none of it happens, none of it's going on, while separately saying it's the greatest thing since air conditioning and sliced bread.
[01:19:11.249 --> 01:19:19.729]  So that's the psychological warfare technique that's going on and that's why they constantly talk about global government, New World Order, global governance.
[01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.969]  Okay?
[01:19:21.055 --> 01:19:22.376]  Because it's here.
[01:19:22.376 --> 01:19:25.359]  We've been in the New World Order completely since the mid-1980s.
[01:19:25.359 --> 01:19:26.561]  There's no doubt of that.
[01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:33.548]  America's been fully captured by offshore banks, and now they're just running our credit card up to finance their whole operation.
[01:19:33.548 --> 01:19:38.112]  And they're using staged terror to set up a police state grid because they know we've already woken up.
[01:19:38.112 --> 01:19:40.034]  Now they're going to try to clamp down on us.
[01:19:40.034 --> 01:19:41.336]  So the fight is on.
[01:19:41.336 --> 01:19:43.278]  I'll come back and talk about could they have pulled off 9-11?
[01:19:44.759 --> 01:19:48.345]  And some of the best books and videos about the Founding Fathers out there.
[01:19:48.345 --> 01:19:51.631]  We'll cover it all straight ahead, and then more of your phone calls.
[01:19:51.631 --> 01:19:55.157]  Chris, Herb, Ron, Ethan, and many others.
[01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:58.523]  This is the one, the only, GCN Radio Network, and I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:01.778 --> 01:20:06.379]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:21:01.204 --> 01:21:07.869]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.869 --> 01:21:15.994]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:15.994 --> 01:21:21.578]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[01:21:21.898 --> 01:21:24.159]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:29.261]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:29.261 --> 01:21:34.463]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:34.463 --> 01:21:38.204]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:38.824 --> 01:21:39.905]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:06.107]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:22:06.107 --> 01:22:08.871]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:22:08.871 --> 01:22:13.356]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:22:14.232 --> 01:22:18.715]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:23:07.256 --> 01:23:10.679]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:23:52.518 --> 01:23:52.558]  888-352-7726.
[01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:27.140]  Oh my gosh!
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.923]  I didn't even cover that!
[01:24:28.923 --> 01:24:32.569]  That just reminded me, Bob Dylan.
[01:24:32.569 --> 01:24:33.931]  Thank you!
[01:24:33.931 --> 01:24:34.833]  Guys, print it for me.
[01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:36.275]  It was from the weekend.
[01:24:36.275 --> 01:24:37.137]  I didn't cover it.
[01:24:37.137 --> 01:24:39.400]  Man, I gotta go for these stacks, no matter what.
[01:24:41.164 --> 01:24:50.968]  In Oklahoma and other states, they've now passed laws that you can't even put burglar bars or a bigger latch on your house to, quote, keep law enforcement out.
[01:24:50.968 --> 01:24:53.930]  You get more than a decade in prison for it.
[01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:56.391]  And my grandma's got burglar bars.
[01:24:56.391 --> 01:25:00.133]  I mean, burglar bars are a great thing, especially when you've got crime.
[01:25:00.133 --> 01:25:01.033]  No, sir!
[01:25:01.033 --> 01:25:02.414]  I had a house with burglar bars.
[01:25:02.414 --> 01:25:03.994]  One time somebody tried to break in, good thing we had it.
[01:25:03.994 --> 01:25:05.495]  It's a big deterrent.
[01:25:05.495 --> 01:25:09.557]  And they're calling in several cities in the U.S.
[01:25:10.942 --> 01:25:15.564]  Including Tulsa, Oklahoma, that you not be allowed to have a garden.
[01:25:15.564 --> 01:25:20.926]  I can see someday when even having your own garden's gonna be against the law!
[01:25:20.926 --> 01:25:23.807]  Cause it's sundown on the Union!
[01:25:23.807 --> 01:25:26.027]  What was made in the USA!
[01:25:26.027 --> 01:25:29.469]  Sure looked like a good idea!
[01:25:29.469 --> 01:25:33.450]  You were in there cringing, Jaren.
[01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:37.531]  You don't like my singing?
[01:25:37.531 --> 01:25:38.612]  Oh, watch yourself, pal.
[01:25:42.083 --> 01:25:43.604]  Oh, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:25:43.604 --> 01:25:47.027]  I just can't handle it.
[01:25:47.027 --> 01:25:49.990]  Courts are ruling they can taser you to answer questions now.
[01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.970]  That's open torture.
[01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:54.774]  Forget Abu Ghraib torture or Camp X-Ray torture.
[01:25:54.774 --> 01:25:58.637]  Okay, answering the other question.
[01:25:58.637 --> 01:26:04.782]  Could the neocons have pulled off 9-11 if they wouldn't have been in office?
[01:26:04.782 --> 01:26:09.526]  And the answer is, the neocons... This is the Wall Street Journal, by the way.
[01:26:11.314 --> 01:26:12.795]  Trotsky got kicked out.
[01:26:12.795 --> 01:26:13.376]  The U.S.
[01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:18.460]  government, the British government, on record, this is Congressional reports, funded Lenin.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:27.228]  But then, by the late 40s, early 50s, after World War II, the West couldn't control their fake communist revolution.
[01:26:27.228 --> 01:26:30.370]  They wanted to build it up as a counter-threat, build a police state here.
[01:26:30.370 --> 01:26:31.151]  That's how they always do it.
[01:26:31.151 --> 01:26:33.253]  They create Saddam, they create bin Laden, they create it all.
[01:26:33.253 --> 01:26:34.254]  And that's on record.
[01:26:36.144 --> 01:26:47.193]  And so, they were unable to control it, and Stalin, who was horrible, of course, but wasn't going along for a while, Trotsky had to flee to Mexico.
[01:26:47.193 --> 01:26:55.020]  And his top lieutenant, of course, was the founder of the neocon movement.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:27:02.206]  His son's one of the top neocons today, William Crystal.
[01:27:03.786 --> 01:27:07.890]  He said, we will overthrow America, just like we did.
[01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:11.974]  They were the original gang that overthrew Russia.
[01:27:11.974 --> 01:27:14.896]  Just like we did, Russia will do it in America.
[01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.137]  I mean, this is on record.
[01:27:16.137 --> 01:27:18.339]  And they said, we will take over the conservative movement.
[01:27:18.339 --> 01:27:22.503]  So the CIA funded William F. Buckley, all the rest of it, the rest is history.
[01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.325]  And this is all on record.
[01:27:25.802 --> 01:27:34.069]  And so, when you talk about neocons, I mean, Rahm Emanuel is a top neocon, who in 96 made sure real anti-war Democrats didn't get elected.
[01:27:34.069 --> 01:27:44.658]  Just like Sarah Palin, and Dick Armey and others are the operatives to make sure real conservatives, real libertarians like Deborah Medina in Texas don't get elected, and it's Rick Perry.
[01:27:44.658 --> 01:27:46.319]  This is how they do it.
[01:27:46.319 --> 01:27:48.100]  This is how they operate.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:51.143]  This is how they get their job done.
[01:27:55.310 --> 01:28:00.931]  And so absolutely, you better believe 9-11 was planned long before Dick Cheney got in.
[01:28:00.931 --> 01:28:10.393]  Now, Dick Cheney did get into office, did get into the Pentagon, in the White House, along with Donald Rumsfeld, his protege, right after L.L.
[01:28:10.393 --> 01:28:13.513]  Lemonsir got kicked out by Kennedy.
[01:28:13.513 --> 01:28:15.634]  And he was one of the top minions of Gerald R. Ford.
[01:28:15.634 --> 01:28:18.594]  They got the Continued Government legislation passed.
[01:28:18.594 --> 01:28:22.475]  They had Bill Moyer's specials on that in the early 80s for martial law and how they were planning it.
[01:28:24.312 --> 01:28:29.394]  They had congressional hearings about it, Rex 84, and so they were top technicians.
[01:28:29.394 --> 01:28:32.915]  So it's not like, would this have happened if Gore got in?
[01:28:32.915 --> 01:28:42.177]  They put Bush and company in because they were the specialist who'd been planning this particular Northwoods ball game ever since the early 60s.
[01:28:42.177 --> 01:28:44.478]  Operation Northwoods declassified plan to bomb U.S.
[01:28:44.478 --> 01:28:50.040]  cities, hijack jets by remote control, crash them, blame it on the Russians in Cuba to start World War III.
[01:28:52.282 --> 01:28:56.965]  ABC News headline, Pentagon plan to terrorize US cities as pretext for war.
[01:28:56.965 --> 01:28:59.387]  Baltimore Sun similar, AP similar.
[01:28:59.387 --> 01:29:04.510]  That's covered in all my 9-11 films, like Road to Tyranny.
[01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:09.054]  But, you know, it's not like what would have happened if McCain got in?
[01:29:09.054 --> 01:29:11.415]  McCain was never meant to get in.
[01:29:11.415 --> 01:29:13.076]  Or what would happen if Al Gore would have got in?
[01:29:13.076 --> 01:29:14.297]  Or what would happen if George Bush Sr.
[01:29:14.297 --> 01:29:16.919]  would have won another term?
[01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:18.860]  Well, I mean, Bill Clinton worked for him.
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.301]  Bill Clinton
[01:29:20.419 --> 01:29:24.481]  We know who his CIA section chief was in London.
[01:29:24.481 --> 01:29:25.682]  It's all staged, folks.
[01:29:25.682 --> 01:29:27.643]  Completely staged.
[01:29:27.643 --> 01:29:30.825]  President's just some hard-working teleprompter reading minion.
[01:29:30.825 --> 01:29:35.748]  Alright, I'm going to try to continue to accelerate through your calls.
[01:29:35.748 --> 01:29:36.888]  But these are important questions.
[01:29:36.888 --> 01:29:38.389]  You asked about founding father books.
[01:29:38.389 --> 01:29:46.174]  The best thing to do is actually read books written by the founding fathers or read compendiums of their letters and their quotes.
[01:29:46.174 --> 01:29:47.955]  That's really the best material out there.
[01:29:47.955 --> 01:29:48.315]  We'll be back.
[01:29:51.505 --> 01:29:55.434]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.434 --> 01:29:58.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.571 --> 01:30:06.532]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.532 --> 01:30:15.395]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.395 --> 01:30:20.016]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.016 --> 01:30:30.840]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:40.982]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:40.982 --> 01:30:46.424]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.424 --> 01:30:53.905]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:53.905 --> 01:30:56.646]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:31:01.764 --> 01:31:05.788]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.788 --> 01:31:09.032]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.032 --> 01:31:13.837]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.837 --> 01:31:20.244]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.244 --> 01:31:22.467]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.987 --> 01:31:23.307]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.307 --> 01:31:23.807]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.807 --> 01:31:24.187]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:24.928]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:24.928 --> 01:31:27.269]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.894 --> 01:31:49.181]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:49.181 --> 01:31:58.289]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:00.516 --> 01:32:05.821]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:32:05.821 --> 01:32:08.583]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:32:08.583 --> 01:32:13.908]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:32:13.908 --> 01:32:15.469]  Friends, I hope that you will order
[01:32:15.469 --> 01:32:18.390]  Order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.
[01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:23.392]  We also have some specials where you can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[01:32:23.392 --> 01:32:34.537]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:32:34.537 --> 01:32:36.397]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:32:36.397 --> 01:32:37.558]  Everybody needs to get it.

[01:32:48.358 --> 01:32:49.759]  Shadow Government.

[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:55.942]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:55.942 --> 01:33:08.988]  Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:33:08.988 --> 01:33:11.710]  I'm going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:12.995 --> 01:33:14.076]  I'm not going to be quite frank.
[01:33:14.076 --> 01:33:21.279]  I got a little bit overheated and excited at the start of the show, and I've been trying to train myself to try to cover all the news I have in front of me.
[01:33:21.279 --> 01:33:25.941]  So I'm going to try to settle down, eat my lunch for five minutes, and then come back to your calls.
[01:33:25.941 --> 01:33:28.563]  Plus, this is a very important video audio.
[01:33:28.563 --> 01:33:30.043]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:30.043 --> 01:33:32.765]  It's also on the YouTube channel.
[01:33:32.765 --> 01:33:37.667]  Starting next week, these YouTube videos are going to be posted first to PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:33:37.667 --> 01:33:39.108]  These emergency alerts we put out.
[01:33:40.652 --> 01:33:49.376]  It's titled, Internet Censorship Alert, Alex Jones Exposes the Takeover of the Internet.
[01:33:49.376 --> 01:33:52.998]  And we're going to go ahead and play this, and I'm going straight to your phone calls.
[01:33:52.998 --> 01:33:56.800]  We got Wayne Madsen coming up as well, and a ton of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.160]  Here it is.
[01:33:59.798 --> 01:34:04.520]  It's time for freedom lovers around the world to stop living in denial.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:13.124]  Chinese-style net censorship and beyond is now being openly and incrementally deployed across the planet.
[01:34:13.124 --> 01:34:19.627]  We have had Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations czar, come out and say they want to quote ban conspiracy theories.
[01:34:20.307 --> 01:34:22.949]  Make you get a license to be able to have a website.
[01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:25.071]  The Italian government has already implemented this.
[01:34:25.071 --> 01:34:32.518]  The Australian government is implementing it and putting in total net filtering, banning websites like Wikileaks.
[01:34:32.518 --> 01:34:39.304]  Major ISPs around the world have been banning Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, my sites.
[01:34:39.304 --> 01:34:40.945]  It's incredible!
[01:34:40.945 --> 01:34:42.427]  And the public
[01:34:44.033 --> 01:34:48.537]  isn't very savvy about the technical things that are involved here.
[01:34:48.537 --> 01:35:03.449]  For instance, several New Zealand publications reported, and I got hundreds of emails from people in Australia and New Zealand in the last week saying that most major ISPs were blocking getting to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:03.449 --> 01:35:08.473]  Then I got emails saying, well wait a minute, I'm in Australia or New Zealand, I can still get it.
[01:35:09.033 --> 01:35:12.095]  Yes, on your ISP.
[01:35:12.095 --> 01:35:14.676]  But some of the biggest were blocking us.
[01:35:14.676 --> 01:35:18.598]  And there are public statements put out by them that indeed we were blocked.
[01:35:18.598 --> 01:35:21.480]  But because of public outcry, we are now not blocked.
[01:35:22.389 --> 01:35:28.590]  The Australian government is saying they will just add to a list whoever they want, or if anyone ever complains about a site.
[01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:30.911]  No judge, no jury, no due process.
[01:35:30.911 --> 01:35:32.251]  Your site is banned.
[01:35:32.251 --> 01:35:34.692]  Domestic sites in Australia are being banned.
[01:35:34.692 --> 01:35:40.633]  They're making people now register with the government to be able to have a site that criticizes politicians.
[01:35:40.633 --> 01:35:42.654]  This is in the news.
[01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:43.734]  This is happening.
[01:35:43.734 --> 01:35:48.455]  Two weeks ago, Bill Gates came out and said, I support China and their censorship.
[01:35:48.455 --> 01:35:50.996]  Now, China mainly uses web filtering.
[01:35:51.756 --> 01:36:02.606]  Even more abusive and draconian, in the United States, we have the head technology officer at Microsoft and others at Davos and U.N.
[01:36:02.606 --> 01:36:05.268]  meetings agreeing with the U.N.
[01:36:05.268 --> 01:36:14.616]  and saying, we want all Americans, all Brits and all Canadians, to have to sign in with a net ID, preferably via a biometric.
[01:36:14.616 --> 01:36:18.059]  They're openly proposing that this now happen.
[01:36:19.258 --> 01:36:20.019]  On top of that,
[01:36:49.138 --> 01:36:53.021]  Mexico talked about killing American journalists in-country.
[01:36:53.021 --> 01:37:02.268]  Even the smallest IT provider will have to put in the software and government snooping hubs where everything is recorded by the government and everything is controlled.
[01:37:02.268 --> 01:37:10.475]  These indexes of thousands of websites that are banned have to be installed at the local ISP level, even in small towns.
[01:37:11.215 --> 01:37:20.777]  Under these different blacklists, we are included, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, all over the country and all over Europe and many other areas of the world.
[01:37:20.777 --> 01:37:29.499]  We have been sent countless screenshots of Cox Communications, Time Warner, you name it.
[01:37:29.499 --> 01:37:35.041]  ISPs in England, we've written articles and put links to their statements going back four years saying,
[01:37:36.161 --> 01:37:38.902]  This is objectionable material.
[01:37:38.902 --> 01:37:41.243]  And there's really four ways they flag.
[01:37:41.243 --> 01:37:51.006]  They say porn, or they say hate, or they say gambling, or illegal activity.
[01:37:51.006 --> 01:37:52.727]  And they normally use hate for us.
[01:37:53.507 --> 01:37:56.969]  Now even if you think what we're saying is hateful, shouldn't there be the free speech?
[01:37:56.969 --> 01:38:01.511]  Shouldn't you have the decision to go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com?
[01:38:01.511 --> 01:38:06.693]  The truth is we have some of the most banned sites worldwide because we are effective.
[01:38:06.693 --> 01:38:08.494]  We cover the real issues.
[01:38:08.494 --> 01:38:17.359]  And so it's not just universities and law enforcement centers and public schools and corporations that are now banning us.
[01:38:18.399 --> 01:38:31.002]  We've got a list on PrisonPlanet.com in an article that Paul Watson wrote titled, Frightening Taste of Internet Censorship as Major Free Speech Website Blocked.
[01:38:31.002 --> 01:38:44.586]  In Watson's article, we have links where major transportation hubs in the EU and in England that are supposedly free internet, that's taxpayer paid for, and Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is blocked.
[01:38:45.166 --> 01:38:51.689]  So we have been put in these databases fraudulently to be blocked and you shouldn't put up with it.
[01:38:51.689 --> 01:38:52.590]  You should complain.
[01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:53.911]  You should say no.
[01:38:53.911 --> 01:38:58.093]  You should call your ISP and tell them you're going to move on to somebody else if they continue this.
[01:38:58.093 --> 01:39:00.374]  Because if we allow this incremental implementation
[01:39:00.954 --> 01:39:01.455]  Of course.
[01:39:16.434 --> 01:39:16.534]  Yes.
[01:39:38.703 --> 01:39:39.904]  And it's not working.
[01:39:39.904 --> 01:39:42.367]  So now they want to incrementally shut it down.
[01:39:42.367 --> 01:39:48.773]  They want to force things onto Internet 2, the safe Internet, as the UN and a Microsoft executive said.
[01:39:48.773 --> 01:39:51.155]  Then you'll have the old Internet, they claim.
[01:39:51.155 --> 01:40:01.566]  But if you really read Internet 2 consortium meeting minutes, they plan to force everybody over to the new Internet, where you have a subdomain with a major carrier who can shut you down whenever they want.
[01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:10.814]  And they're going to incrementally shut down the old web and use this cyber security legislation to restrict free speech.
[01:40:10.814 --> 01:40:15.517]  And in the words of the White House, in the words of Barack Obama, they have said...
[01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:24.974]  A declaration of war against free speech that they may shut the web down to save it during some staged false flag cyber attack they launch.
[01:40:24.974 --> 01:40:28.955]  They have said that the Pentagon is going to be in control of it.
[01:40:28.955 --> 01:40:31.896]  They're building the giant NSA slash Pentagon.
[01:40:33.237 --> 01:40:39.320]  Fortresses all over the country and forcing all the major ISPs to wire into their grid.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:45.342]  They've built a giant separate network outside of the original internet that they're going to force everyone on to.
[01:40:45.342 --> 01:40:46.103]  This is happening.
[01:40:46.103 --> 01:40:48.644]  IT professionals everywhere are discussing it.
[01:40:48.644 --> 01:40:50.645]  CNET News is exposing it.
[01:40:50.645 --> 01:40:55.867]  Mother Jones, back in April of last year, almost a year ago, should Obama control the internet.
[01:40:55.867 --> 01:41:00.329]  A new bill would give President emergency authority to halt web traffic and access private data.
[01:41:00.689 --> 01:41:04.352]  Time Magazine pushes draconian internet licensing plan.
[01:41:04.352 --> 01:41:10.437]  Death of the internet, censorship bills, and UK, Australia, US aim to block undesirable websites.
[01:41:10.437 --> 01:41:12.519]  One of their main targets is WikiLeaks.
[01:41:12.519 --> 01:41:15.061]  It's being banned everywhere because it exposes government corruption.
[01:41:15.061 --> 01:41:17.944]  Obama information czar calls for banning free speech.
[01:41:18.624 --> 01:41:23.065]  And I've got his quotes here from the paper that Cass Sunstein wrote a year and a half ago.
[01:41:23.065 --> 01:41:26.026]  Quote, government might ban conspiracy theorizing.
[01:41:26.026 --> 01:41:27.507]  That's any criticism of government.
[01:41:27.507 --> 01:41:29.868]  That's anything outside their tiny orthodoxy.
[01:41:29.868 --> 01:41:34.029]  He lists saying that man-made global warming isn't real as a bannable offense.
[01:41:34.329 --> 01:41:41.714]  He lists saying that a little bit of sunlight is good for you as a conspiracy theory and should be banned when all the major studies show it's good for you.
[01:41:41.714 --> 01:41:47.539]  He says government might impose some kind of new tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories.
[01:41:47.539 --> 01:41:50.441]  I mean, folks, this is what they're saying.
[01:41:50.441 --> 01:41:51.622]  This is really happening.
[01:41:52.282 --> 01:41:56.027]  Police want backdoor to web users' private data without warrants.
[01:41:56.027 --> 01:41:58.289]  CNET News under cybersecurity.
[01:41:58.289 --> 01:42:00.151]  This is all going on.
[01:42:00.151 --> 01:42:03.215]  We are being censored right now.
[01:42:03.215 --> 01:42:04.116]  Do you understand?
[01:42:04.116 --> 01:42:04.817]  It's happening.
[01:42:06.403 --> 01:42:14.170]  Italy, England, Canada, the US, Australia, New Zealand are all implementing this incrementally right now.
[01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:19.315]  Today it's the ISPs, but the ISPs are building in partnership with the government.
[01:42:19.315 --> 01:42:22.217]  It says private corporate partnerships
[01:42:23.158 --> 01:42:37.844]  Where they hack up different sectors of the web, and that they will be able to police and do whatever they want, recruiting giant youth squads to serve in Homeland Security facilities, countering disinformation, countering lies about the government.
[01:42:37.844 --> 01:42:40.145]  CENTCOM admits they're doing this.
[01:42:40.145 --> 01:42:43.206]  Stop living in denial.
[01:42:43.206 --> 01:42:44.967]  This is happening.
[01:42:44.967 --> 01:42:45.928]  What do we do about it?
[01:42:45.928 --> 01:42:46.808]  You call the Senate.
[01:42:47.884 --> 01:42:51.105]  You tell them, do not implement this draconian bill.
[01:42:51.105 --> 01:42:52.826]  The Senate version's even worse.
[01:42:52.826 --> 01:42:56.847]  Kill the Cybersecurity Act.
[01:42:56.847 --> 01:43:01.489]  Understand that our government's been caught staging false flag after false flag.
[01:43:01.489 --> 01:43:08.271]  They're constantly hyping how dangerous the Internet is because they can't allow it to continue to operate because it's exposing their fraud.
[01:43:08.271 --> 01:43:15.254]  They have the incentive to launch a fake cybersecurity attack, just like the Gulf of Tonkin or the Reichstag, as a pretext of control.
[01:43:15.994 --> 01:43:19.236]  Support the free internet now while you still have it.
[01:43:19.236 --> 01:43:26.560]  Appreciate sites like Wikileaks and Infowars.com and the Electronic Frontiers Foundation and what it's doing.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.961]  Support sites like Cryptome.
[01:43:28.961 --> 01:43:31.783]  All of these sites are under attack on record.
[01:43:31.783 --> 01:43:34.544]  Many of them are being raided by the FBI.
[01:43:34.544 --> 01:43:37.205]  They don't want the people standing up against what they're doing.
[01:43:38.326 --> 01:43:41.547]  And they are testing the people's resolve right now.
[01:43:41.547 --> 01:43:44.348]  They are pushing the borders of what they can get away with.
[01:43:44.348 --> 01:43:46.248]  They're sending up trial balloons.
[01:43:46.248 --> 01:43:57.231]  Now is the time to let them know we are not going to let more oppressive laws than even Communist China has installed take place here in the United States and in Europe.
[01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:03.393]  Out of the gates, they're proposing more oppressive systems than what China even has.
[01:44:03.393 --> 01:44:05.553]  And that's mainstream news!
[01:44:05.553 --> 01:44:07.054]  It's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:07.774 --> 01:44:12.697]  If you think you're being raped by big government right now, they haven't even gotten started.
[01:44:12.697 --> 01:44:14.599]  We need to keep the internet free.
[01:44:14.599 --> 01:44:23.485]  We're also going to be developing plans to create printable newspapers, DVD distribution, other systems to get around all of this.
[01:44:23.485 --> 01:44:27.047]  But in the end, we're up against classic tyranny and it doesn't look good.
[01:44:27.047 --> 01:44:28.588]  So please spread this video.
[01:44:28.588 --> 01:44:30.109]  Please spread the articles we've written.
[01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:33.451]  Please make your own videos and analyze the attacks on the internet.
[01:44:33.451 --> 01:44:36.873]  If we don't stand together, we're all going to hang separately.
[01:44:36.873 --> 01:44:37.634]  God bless you all.
[01:44:39.455 --> 01:44:47.057]  And there's an article that goes with that video, Every Word I Say, as a mainstream news article or a government document.
[01:44:47.057 --> 01:44:48.338]  Internet Censorship Alert!
[01:44:48.338 --> 01:44:52.799]  Alex Jones Exposes Agenda to Blacklist of Sending Sites and Licensed Users.
[01:44:52.799 --> 01:44:58.741]  Article by Aaron Dykes, if you want to go pull up that video and help us make it go viral.
[01:44:58.741 --> 01:45:06.904]  Because what we've learned from ClimateGate and FluGate and the takeover of healthcare and all of it is, when we stand up and fight, the New World Order fails.
[01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:09.511]  Now, I've got Reuters here.
[01:45:09.511 --> 01:45:15.056]  China, People's Liberation Army officers urge economic punch against U.S.
[01:45:15.056 --> 01:45:15.916]  to dump U.S.
[01:45:15.916 --> 01:45:18.158]  bonds and destroy our economy.
[01:45:18.158 --> 01:45:23.342]  Oh, that's our little friend that we gave all our secrets to, that the bankers have moved all our industry to.
[01:45:23.342 --> 01:45:24.283]  But they're not the threat.
[01:45:24.283 --> 01:45:27.646]  No, we've got to attack Iran.
[01:45:27.646 --> 01:45:28.867]  That is coming up.
[01:45:28.867 --> 01:45:29.508]  And here it is.
[01:45:29.508 --> 01:45:32.130]  Oklahoma law makes home fortification illegal.
[01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:34.592]  And the law states any type of burglar bars, anything.
[01:45:36.311 --> 01:45:43.639]  And I've got another report here where they want to license being able to have a garden because you might grow marijuana.
[01:45:43.639 --> 01:45:46.763]  Say, oh, you can't, a prisoner can't have a garden in their backyard.
[01:45:46.763 --> 01:45:48.364]  Well, you're prisoners!
[01:45:48.364 --> 01:45:50.447]  You're here to be our slaves!
[01:45:50.447 --> 01:45:52.549]  What's going on in Oklahoma?
[01:45:52.549 --> 01:45:54.071]  Let's go to your calls now.
[01:45:54.071 --> 01:45:56.794]  Chris in New Hampshire, then Herberon, Ethan Stepp, and others.
[01:45:56.794 --> 01:45:57.555]  You're on the air, Chris.
[01:45:58.993 --> 01:46:06.480]  Hey Alex, Chris here calling from New Hampshire, the only state in the country that still doesn't have a mandatory seatbelt law.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:08.182]  How are you, sir?
[01:46:08.182 --> 01:46:10.824]  Live free or die state, welcome.
[01:46:10.824 --> 01:46:11.665]  Absolutely.
[01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:16.810]  I am very concerned about the internet censorship that's going on at all levels.
[01:46:16.810 --> 01:46:23.196]  But it seems like it's just proof that what we're doing is working, and like you say all the time, the enemy is definitely on the run.
[01:46:24.410 --> 01:46:31.954]  Last year, all the people around me, my family, my friends, were asleep, stumbling through their daily lives.
[01:46:31.954 --> 01:46:38.038]  Now all my friends and family are waking up, and it's amazing to witness the transformation.
[01:46:38.038 --> 01:46:45.042]  It's largely due to your films, your websites, and your podcasts, so I thank you, and thank God for the Internet.
[01:46:45.042 --> 01:46:48.384]  I've got three quick things.
[01:46:48.384 --> 01:46:50.545]  YouTube News is gone.
[01:46:50.545 --> 01:46:52.066]  Do you have any information on that?
[01:46:53.322 --> 01:47:03.050]  You know, uh, we don't have the IT people and I know he was offering to give it to us, Daryl Rundus, and I guess we never used it so we got rid of it.
[01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:09.174]  Uh, perhaps, uh, hey Matt, will you call Daryl Rundus and find out where UDU News went?
[01:47:09.174 --> 01:47:12.937]  They were asking us to take it and put it on our servers and I guess we didn't.
[01:47:12.937 --> 01:47:15.619]  So we need to figure that out and get the database if they want to give it to us.
[01:47:15.619 --> 01:47:17.020]  No, I don't, I don't know, sir.
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:17.661]  That's the problem.
[01:47:17.661 --> 01:47:21.284]  I got a million things I want to do and I can't do them all.
[01:47:21.284 --> 01:47:21.444]  Yeah.
[01:47:22.376 --> 01:47:31.838]  The other thing, two more things, we're getting a second chance at the 10th Amendment resolution here in New Hampshire, so I encourage everyone listening to support that.
[01:47:31.838 --> 01:47:41.359]  I think there's a hearing on the 11th, and more information can probably be found on the forums in New Hampshire.
[01:47:41.359 --> 01:47:49.681]  The third thing, the company I work for is offering 100 free one-year accounts for people who live in New Zealand.
[01:47:50.658 --> 01:47:57.184]  In Australia, so they can continue to visit Infowars.com and enjoy all the information you provide.
[01:47:57.184 --> 01:47:59.926]  If it's okay, I'll give out the site.
[01:47:59.926 --> 01:48:00.747]  If not, I understand.
[01:48:00.747 --> 01:48:01.407]  I mean, what is it?
[01:48:01.407 --> 01:48:02.648]  A proxy site or something?
[01:48:02.648 --> 01:48:04.570]  A proxy server?
[01:48:04.570 --> 01:48:06.091]  It's actually better.
[01:48:06.091 --> 01:48:13.197]  Proxy servers generally only allow access to one protocol, which is typically for web traffic is port 80.
[01:48:13.197 --> 01:48:16.620]  The service we provide allows all ports and protocols.
[01:48:17.529 --> 01:48:26.697]  Um, so it allows people from New Zealand and Australia to connect to a server that we have here in New Hampshire via what's called a virtual private network.
[01:48:26.697 --> 01:48:35.404]  And when they do connect to the server, then they surf the web from here, uh, you know, thus bypassing all the filters and all the blocks.
[01:48:35.404 --> 01:48:38.826]  So it's like a proxy bubble that people are in.
[01:48:38.826 --> 01:48:39.987]  It's even better.
[01:48:39.987 --> 01:48:43.210]  It's actually... Go ahead and plug it.
[01:48:43.210 --> 01:48:43.851]  I'm gonna move on.
[01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:44.111]  Go ahead.
[01:48:44.884 --> 01:48:45.905]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[01:48:45.905 --> 01:48:48.446]  It's PatriotInternet.com.
[01:48:48.446 --> 01:48:50.287]  Alright, buddy, I appreciate your call.
[01:48:50.287 --> 01:48:51.527]  What a great name.
[01:48:51.527 --> 01:48:54.129]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Herb in Ohio.
[01:48:54.129 --> 01:48:56.070]  Herb, go ahead.
[01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:59.291]  Alex, what a pleasure, what a privilege.
[01:48:59.291 --> 01:49:08.596]  One thing that bothered me that you said, and you say it a lot, and I really do worry about you for personal reasons, and that is you say, this stuff's getting to you, it's going to make you crazy.
[01:49:08.596 --> 01:49:09.736]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[01:49:09.736 --> 01:49:11.837]  My father discovered this stuff back in the 1960s.
[01:49:13.519 --> 01:49:15.500]  And it ultimately made him nuts.
[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.041]  He actually cracked up over it.
[01:49:18.041 --> 01:49:20.122]  And... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:49:20.122 --> 01:49:23.243]  I mean, that's a figure of speech when I say this stuff's crazy.
[01:49:23.243 --> 01:49:25.804]  No, I mean, it is overwhelming, but I have a great spirit.
[01:49:25.804 --> 01:49:28.806]  I mean, better spirits than I've ever been in my 36 years of life.
[01:49:28.806 --> 01:49:32.347]  So, I'm not sure what you're talking about.
[01:49:32.347 --> 01:49:35.288]  Well, I'm just saying, he just couldn't handle it anymore.
[01:49:35.288 --> 01:49:37.089]  All the stuff he saw coming in.
[01:49:37.089 --> 01:49:41.151]  I mean, and back in the 60s, you know, he stumbled on this stuff.
[01:49:41.926 --> 01:49:44.007]  And he didn't have, obviously, the internet and stuff.
[01:49:44.007 --> 01:49:48.070]  And I remember he would just... I mean, you know, he went out and bought Carol Quigley's book.
[01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:50.932]  He bought... I mean, he started getting so much into this.
[01:49:50.932 --> 01:49:57.836]  And people back 45 years ago just thought... I mean, he was just labeled a complete kook and a nut and everything.
[01:49:57.836 --> 01:50:01.439]  And he eventually did have a nervous breakdown over the whole thing.
[01:50:01.439 --> 01:50:02.960]  And I just don't want that to happen to you.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:05.301]  Yeah, well, that's not how peer pressure works on me.
[01:50:05.301 --> 01:50:08.803]  When I know I'm right, it only makes me stronger when I get persecuted, actually, sir.
[01:50:08.803 --> 01:50:09.444]  It's the opposite.
[01:50:10.489 --> 01:50:13.890]  Number two, one thing I want to mention, I'm a chiropractor.
[01:50:13.890 --> 01:50:19.613]  I've been fighting the vaccinations for the last 35 years.
[01:50:19.613 --> 01:50:28.356]  And people who think that the vaccinations cured all these diseases, I'm telling you, if they look into it, they'll find out that nothing could have been further from the truth.
[01:50:28.356 --> 01:50:29.857]  That was not legitimate.
[01:50:29.857 --> 01:50:35.179]  And even Jonas Salk admitted that what his vaccine did was not legitimate or anything else.
[01:50:35.179 --> 01:50:38.901]  Well, it gave over 100 million Americans the
[01:50:40.171 --> 01:50:42.692]  SV40 cancer virus, and that's on record.
[01:50:42.692 --> 01:50:43.973]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:43.973 --> 01:50:52.016]  If you look at the Western world, by the 1920s, people got running water and stopped dumping stuff in the street, and suddenly all the diseases went down.
[01:50:52.016 --> 01:50:56.759]  Then vaccines got implemented in the 30s and 40s, and the numbers actually went back up.
[01:50:56.759 --> 01:50:59.580]  So it actually made things worse, according to the gross statistics.
[01:51:01.448 --> 01:51:02.749]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.749 --> 01:51:08.331]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.331 --> 01:51:13.353]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.353 --> 01:51:18.935]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.935 --> 01:51:23.617]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:31.268]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.268 --> 01:51:32.368]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.368 --> 01:51:39.072]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:39.072 --> 01:51:42.254]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.254 --> 01:51:45.395]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:49.045 --> 01:51:53.293]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:53.293 --> 01:51:58.122]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.122 --> 01:52:00.506]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:21.221 --> 01:52:25.324]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[01:52:25.424 --> 01:52:29.785]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[01:52:29.785 --> 01:52:34.347]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[01:52:34.347 --> 01:52:36.427]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[01:52:36.427 --> 01:52:38.568]  I can't say enough about this book.

[01:52:40.488 --> 01:52:46.210]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.

[01:54:47.652 --> 01:54:49.634]  Let's talk to Ron in California.
[01:54:49.634 --> 01:54:50.975]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:54:50.975 --> 01:54:52.457]  Hey Alex.
[01:54:52.457 --> 01:54:53.538]  Welcome.
[01:54:53.538 --> 01:55:04.507]  Do you remember when Henry Kissinger was at the New York Stock Exchange and he was talking about how Obama would be the perfect guy to bring in the New World Order?
[01:55:04.507 --> 01:55:07.370]  Yeah, we have that clip actually in the Obama Deception.
[01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:08.751]  He's perfect to fool the public.
[01:55:09.622 --> 01:55:10.342]  Yeah.
[01:55:10.342 --> 01:55:15.964]  Well, what happened is I called up Mark Levin, his radio show, and I was telling him about that.
[01:55:15.964 --> 01:55:18.746]  And he said it didn't exist, right?
[01:55:18.746 --> 01:55:24.828]  No, he acted like he was surprised because I was so, you know, confident, you know, in what I was telling him.
[01:55:24.828 --> 01:55:27.909]  You know, he goes, oh, is that what he said?
[01:55:27.909 --> 01:55:29.850]  And I go, yes, that's exactly what he said.
[01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:36.052]  Then he went on to, you know, scramble up the words like, well, what do you think about the Bohemians?
[01:55:38.368 --> 01:55:38.628]  Thank you.
[01:55:55.396 --> 01:56:01.178]  And every point that I made that he was trying to, you know, make me look... They put articles and videos up!
[01:56:01.178 --> 01:56:02.578]  That's why we're killing them!
[01:56:02.578 --> 01:56:10.340]  And again, it's our model, and I just did it instinctively back from AXS TV 14 years ago, where we put every article up as we talk.
[01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:12.981]  Everybody's doing that now, and it's just devastating.
[01:56:12.981 --> 01:56:14.561]  What's the name of the video?
[01:56:14.561 --> 01:56:22.084]  The name of the video is called, Mark Levin Challenging Caller on Kissinger's New World Order Mention.
[01:56:22.084 --> 01:56:22.884]  Did you guys hear that?
[01:56:24.116 --> 01:56:24.756]  It is right there.
[01:56:24.756 --> 01:56:26.857]  I'm looking at it right now.
[01:56:26.857 --> 01:56:27.697]  Uh-oh.
[01:56:27.697 --> 01:56:29.497]  Guys, guys, get the name of this video again.
[01:56:29.497 --> 01:56:30.017]  Tell us again.
[01:56:30.017 --> 01:56:33.358]  Oh, it's, um, let me look one more time.
[01:56:33.358 --> 01:56:39.399]  Mark Levin challenging caller on Kissinger's New World Order mention.
[01:56:39.399 --> 01:56:45.780]  Okay, well that's great because everybody can call into these shows and do what you've done and reach millions of people.
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:50.621]  And pretty soon he can't act like you're kooky or weird if half his callers are calling in talking about it.
[01:56:50.621 --> 01:56:50.961]  That's why
[01:56:52.034 --> 01:56:54.597]  Limbaugh's forced to talk about it now.
[01:56:54.597 --> 01:56:57.019]  Savage is forced to talk about it a lot more now.
[01:56:57.019 --> 01:56:59.502]  But he wouldn't talk about it actually in the past more than them.
[01:56:59.502 --> 01:57:00.923]  Give credit where it's due.
[01:57:00.923 --> 01:57:03.606]  And Drudge has now, last year, been covering it all.
[01:57:03.606 --> 01:57:04.887]  Because this is the truth!
[01:57:04.887 --> 01:57:06.529]  I mean, they will be obsolete.
[01:57:06.529 --> 01:57:09.712]  They won't even be in the game if they don't start covering the real facts.
[01:57:09.712 --> 01:57:11.134]  That's great news, Ron.
[01:57:11.134 --> 01:57:11.914]  Keep it up.
[01:57:11.914 --> 01:57:13.376]  Let's talk to Ethan in Canada.
[01:57:13.376 --> 01:57:14.037]  Ethan, you're on the air.
[01:57:16.252 --> 01:57:17.793]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:57:17.793 --> 01:57:19.855]  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
[01:57:19.855 --> 01:57:26.561]  I just want to commend you, first of all, for your courage in exposing these cannibalistic tyrants that are trying to take over this planet.
[01:57:26.561 --> 01:57:29.183]  By myself, I'm calling up from Oshawa, Ontario, Canada.
[01:57:29.183 --> 01:57:33.207]  It's just a small town about 50 miles east of Toronto.
[01:57:33.207 --> 01:57:40.233]  Well, my fear is if you guys down there, you guys are all armed, you have your amendments that allows you to keep your weapons that they are trying to take from what I've been hearing.
[01:57:40.233 --> 01:57:40.894]  Up here in Canada,
[01:57:41.713 --> 01:57:42.454]  That's my point.
[01:57:59.016 --> 01:58:02.337]  Handguns are now basically close to restricted.
[01:58:02.337 --> 01:58:03.938]  You're only allowed, certain people are allowed to have them.
[01:58:03.938 --> 01:58:06.059]  They're trying to make long guns now illegal as well.
[01:58:06.059 --> 01:58:09.300]  Basically we're just up here where defenseless as is.
[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:11.961]  So I feel we're in a much worse state than you guys are down there.
[01:58:11.961 --> 01:58:13.842]  Let me break this down.
[01:58:13.842 --> 01:58:22.286]  Here's the deal, and we don't want this to happen, but if we go into a Soviet or Nazi type tyranny, do you know what you can do?
[01:58:23.427 --> 01:58:24.608]  With a knife.
[01:58:24.608 --> 01:58:28.130]  You can get all the guns you ever wanted, if you're willing to use it.
[01:58:28.130 --> 01:58:33.233]  And I know a lot of people, it's easier to defend yourself with a gun because you just pull the trigger, but let me tell you something.
[01:58:33.233 --> 01:58:35.214]  It's real easy.
[01:58:35.214 --> 01:58:42.798]  It's real easy to take out four or five people in about 60 seconds with a double-edged dagger.
[01:58:42.798 --> 01:58:46.200]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.221]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.584 --> 01:58:54.585]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.585 --> 01:58:59.908]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.908 --> 01:59:01.969]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.969 --> 01:59:06.971]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.971 --> 01:59:08.151]  How much do you want?
[01:59:08.151 --> 01:59:09.272]  When do you want it?
[01:59:09.272 --> 01:59:11.153]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:11.153 --> 01:59:12.233]  When will you need it?
[01:59:12.233 --> 01:59:14.434]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.434 --> 01:59:15.775]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.775 --> 01:59:17.295]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:17.295 --> 01:59:18.356]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:59:18.516 --> 01:59:19.838]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:59:19.838 --> 01:59:22.561]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:22.561 --> 01:59:26.146]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:26.146 --> 01:59:29.971]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.971 --> 01:59:31.212]  How much will you need?
[01:59:31.212 --> 01:59:32.093]  We don't know.
[01:59:32.093 --> 01:59:33.215]  How much do you want?
[01:59:33.215 --> 01:59:34.136]  All you can get.
[01:59:34.136 --> 01:59:34.937]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:35.217 --> 01:59:38.258]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:38.258 --> 01:59:40.458]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:40.458 --> 01:59:41.458]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:41.458 --> 01:59:42.679]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:42.679 --> 01:59:44.499]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.737 --> 02:00:10.560]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.161]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.161 --> 02:00:13.062]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.062 --> 02:00:17.905]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.905 --> 02:00:24.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:27.032]  I suggest everybody take fencing.
[02:00:27.032 --> 02:00:30.474]  Do you have any idea what a sword or a short sword can do?
[02:00:30.474 --> 02:00:33.116]  Do you have any idea how devastating they are?
[02:00:36.969 --> 02:00:38.189]  A longbow?
[02:00:38.189 --> 02:00:39.850]  A compound bow?
[02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:47.793]  Look, to protect yourself from criminals, baseball bat, longbow, crossbow, hatchet, hammer, ball-peen hammer.
[02:00:47.793 --> 02:00:52.975]  You know what a ball-peen hammer, a larger ball-peen hammer will do?
[02:00:52.975 --> 02:00:59.898]  Say, with a three or four pound head, or pound head, little tip, you use the round end.
[02:00:59.898 --> 02:01:03.319]  Somebody busts in your house, somebody trying to rob you and your wife, somebody trying to rape you,
[02:01:04.471 --> 02:01:06.651]  Beat him to death with a ball-peen hammer.
[02:01:06.651 --> 02:01:12.553]  Usually, the assaulter's all jazzed up on drugs and thinks you're going to lay down and take it.
[02:01:12.553 --> 02:01:15.633]  Now, in England, they arrest you if you defend yourself with a hammer or a knife.
[02:01:15.633 --> 02:01:20.454]  They want the message, you are our slaves, you don't defend yourself from criminals.
[02:01:20.454 --> 02:01:27.596]  But, the fact is, you know, hypothetically, say the communist Chinese took over.
[02:01:27.596 --> 02:01:29.136]  Any enemy.
[02:01:29.136 --> 02:01:32.937]  I mean, do you know what you can do?
[02:01:32.937 --> 02:01:33.477]  With a hammer?
[02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:47.641]  I've seen a lot of reports studying World War II where a lot of sentries and people and some of the trench warfare they had in and around the Battle of the Bulge, they would simply carry ball-peen hammers.
[02:01:47.641 --> 02:02:01.493]  Because when you're crawling around in the snow and up over berms and reconnaissance, you don't, and there may be 20 Germans just 50 yards away and there's a sentry, you just come down on them full power with a hammer on their head.
[02:02:01.493 --> 02:02:01.913]  It's over.
[02:02:05.515 --> 02:02:08.376]  Some people say, well, go up with a knife and get them in the kidneys.
[02:02:08.376 --> 02:02:09.956]  You better know what you're doing if you do that.
[02:02:09.956 --> 02:02:17.358]  I mean, if you don't get it into the right organs fast, a lot of people are so tough they're going to still go ape.
[02:02:17.358 --> 02:02:21.839]  But there's nothing that stops a ball-peen hammer full force right through the skull.
[02:02:21.839 --> 02:02:25.540]  It's lights out on Mike Tyson, folks.
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:29.521]  And cops can't get you carrying a hammer in your car, even in cities where you're not allowed to arm yourself.
[02:02:29.521 --> 02:02:33.042]  You have a toolbox back there, a little ball-peen hammer.
[02:02:33.993 --> 02:02:36.314]  And some carjackers try to take your car?
[02:02:36.314 --> 02:02:39.215]  They're not expecting you to do anything.
[02:02:39.215 --> 02:02:43.297]  They're not expecting you to defend yourself, but obviously you want firearms to protect yourself.
[02:02:43.297 --> 02:02:46.178]  But does that answer your question, Ethan?
[02:02:46.178 --> 02:02:52.081]  It definitely alleviates some of the problems I was having in ideas of defense.
[02:02:52.081 --> 02:02:59.544]  Again, if you have a standing army against you with their own firearms, you would definitely prefer to have something that you could shoot back with some sort of a turret.
[02:02:59.544 --> 02:03:02.766]  But do you have any idea what a saber will do to somebody?
[02:03:03.703 --> 02:03:22.023]  No, which was going to be a question I had for you, was being a disarmed nation, a majority of us being disarmed, in the event of an invasion, in the event of martial law, in the event of outright anarchy, what are some ideas to defend ourselves or some things that we can do as survivors?
[02:03:22.023 --> 02:03:24.806]  Well, in Oklahoma you can't even have burglar bars ten years in present.
[02:03:25.503 --> 02:03:26.604]  I've been hearing that.
[02:03:26.604 --> 02:03:27.904]  No, I've got the mainstream news.
[02:03:27.904 --> 02:03:28.665]  They're very proud of it.
[02:03:28.665 --> 02:03:33.027]  Again, because a criminal government runs things, they're in league with the criminals.
[02:03:33.027 --> 02:03:35.948]  The criminal police and the criminals on the street.
[02:03:35.948 --> 02:03:40.470]  That doesn't mean all the police are criminals, but their bosses are by and large criminals now.
[02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:45.773]  And again, I say get Canadians together and start repealing these laws.
[02:03:45.773 --> 02:03:46.353]  You can do it.
[02:03:46.353 --> 02:03:47.894]  They're going to come out of their slumber.
[02:03:47.894 --> 02:03:48.915]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:48.915 --> 02:03:49.535]  Anything else, Ethan?
[02:03:50.799 --> 02:03:52.620]  I had a bunch, but I don't want to take too much of your time.
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:53.980]  Maybe I will call in another day.
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:04:04.123]  I just kind of wanted to maybe give you a bio of the small town I'm in, which has basically been floated on the back of Freemasonry since the beginning of World War II, at least.
[02:04:04.123 --> 02:04:11.925]  Well, there are a lot of towns and cities where the masons have been used as an arm of a good old boy boss hog system to take over, and it's shameful.
[02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:15.186]  And the Masons claim they want to fight the New World Order and tyranny.
[02:04:15.186 --> 02:04:16.186]  I got all their letters and mail.
[02:04:16.186 --> 02:04:17.607]  Well, let's see it then.
[02:04:17.607 --> 02:04:18.667]  Let's see it.
[02:04:18.667 --> 02:04:19.768]  Clean up all this stuff.
[02:04:19.768 --> 02:04:22.429]  Because, you know, the argument is, well, George Washington was a Mason.
[02:04:22.429 --> 02:04:27.711]  Yeah, but, you know, this isn't your great-great-great-great-granddaddy's Masons.
[02:04:27.711 --> 02:04:29.592]  And in England, I mean, it's mainstream news.
[02:04:29.592 --> 02:04:32.273]  I have members of Parliament on from England about how the Masons run everything.
[02:04:32.893 --> 02:04:36.235]  All right, we got a big special announcement coming up in the next segment.
[02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:40.517]  And then joining us in about five minutes is going to be Wayne Madsen.
[02:04:40.517 --> 02:04:47.001]  Wayne Madsen report with a lot of incredibly important news straight ahead.
[02:04:47.001 --> 02:04:51.103]  And massive news blitzes, but Madsen's only with us about 30 minutes or so.
[02:04:51.103 --> 02:04:54.505]  I'm going to get to Step, Curtis, Scott, Chris, and others.
[02:04:54.505 --> 02:04:56.125]  We're going to get to everybody today.
[02:04:56.125 --> 02:04:58.167]  Special announcement in the info war.
[02:04:58.167 --> 02:04:59.547]  Big news straight ahead.
[02:05:01.368 --> 02:05:02.510]  What's your home worth?
[02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:04.632]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:05:04.632 --> 02:05:07.676]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:05:07.676 --> 02:05:15.386]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[02:05:15.386 --> 02:05:18.851]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[02:06:00.728 --> 02:06:07.713]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:06:07.713 --> 02:06:09.794]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:06:09.794 --> 02:06:12.036]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:06:12.036 --> 02:06:13.697]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:06:13.697 --> 02:06:18.000]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:20.742]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:06:20.742 --> 02:06:26.747]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[02:06:26.747 --> 02:06:31.551]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:06:31.551 --> 02:06:34.373]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:06:34.373 --> 02:06:37.095]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:06:37.095 --> 02:06:38.436]  This system is free of chemicals.
[02:06:38.456 --> 02:06:38.957]  I think so.
[02:07:00.506 --> 02:07:05.048]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.048 --> 02:07:05.969]  Number one.
[02:07:05.969 --> 02:07:09.391]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.391 --> 02:07:10.251]  Number two.
[02:07:10.251 --> 02:07:15.154]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.154 --> 02:07:15.894]  It's true.
[02:07:15.894 --> 02:07:20.437]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.757 --> 02:07:21.578]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.578 --> 02:07:25.161]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.161 --> 02:07:29.085]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.085 --> 02:07:29.885]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.885 --> 02:07:32.648]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.648 --> 02:07:36.331]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.331 --> 02:07:37.112]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.112 --> 02:07:41.256]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.256 --> 02:07:46.020]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:50.482]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.482 --> 02:07:52.263]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.263 --> 02:07:54.523]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.523 --> 02:07:59.606]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:59.606 --> 02:08:09.370]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.370 --> 02:08:12.351]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.192 --> 02:08:18.313]  Well, it's only about a minute delayed.
[02:08:18.313 --> 02:08:21.115]  I'm here listening to it right now.
[02:08:21.115 --> 02:08:29.700]  It's the InfoWars.com Listen Live News Feed iPhone app.
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:31.161]  And I can turn it up.
[02:08:31.161 --> 02:08:37.245]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:08:37.245 --> 02:08:38.726]  Number four, dangerous weather.
[02:08:39.773 --> 02:08:41.514]  You like that, folks?
[02:08:41.514 --> 02:08:46.859]  We're going to put the article up on screen for people right now.
[02:08:46.859 --> 02:08:49.882]  Listen to the Alex Jones Show with the new iPhone app.
[02:08:49.882 --> 02:08:51.002]  And guess what?
[02:08:51.002 --> 02:08:53.344]  The best part about it is it's free!
[02:08:53.344 --> 02:08:58.569]  Go to InfoWars.com if you have an iPhone or any other type of Apple system.
[02:08:58.569 --> 02:09:01.571]  We're going to launch some other apps soon for the other competing systems.
[02:09:02.492 --> 02:09:04.213]  We intend for this to be really big.
[02:09:04.213 --> 02:09:17.441]  We're also going to launch some other apps soon for PrisonPlanet.TV members to get the videos downloaded or streamed and the live show and the archives of the video when we're live at PrisonPlanet.TV, at least the second half of the show every day.
[02:09:17.441 --> 02:09:19.442]  Some days we do all four hours of the show.
[02:09:19.442 --> 02:09:22.044]  As you know, many days three hours of the show, but always at least two.
[02:09:22.044 --> 02:09:26.927]  It is the Alex Jones Show InfoWars.com phone app.
[02:09:26.927 --> 02:09:29.168]  Let's see if the delay is over and we're back live.
[02:09:32.992 --> 02:09:38.075]  You know what I think that did is?
[02:09:38.075 --> 02:09:39.316]  That's a feedback loop.
[02:09:39.316 --> 02:09:45.500]  That was because at the start of the show I faded it up, the start of that segment, and so it went back to the ad.
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:46.660]  Listen to this.
[02:10:01.533 --> 02:10:06.756]  Go to InfoWars.com if you have an iPhone or any other type of Apple system.
[02:10:06.756 --> 02:10:10.679]  We're going to launch some other apps soon for the other competing systems.
[02:10:10.679 --> 02:10:12.420]  We intend for this to be really big.
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:25.028]  We're also going to launch some other apps soon for PrisonPlanet.tv members to get the videos downloaded or streamed and the live show and the archives of the video when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv at least the second half of the show.
[02:10:25.028 --> 02:10:28.431]  You know, if I shut up, it'll actually end to the dead air from when I shut up.
[02:10:31.624 --> 02:10:35.108]  It is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com phone app.
[02:10:35.108 --> 02:10:37.410]  Let's see if the delay's over and we're back live.
[02:10:37.410 --> 02:10:52.326]  Okay, that's enough of that.
[02:10:52.326 --> 02:10:53.107]  That's enough of that.
[02:10:55.367 --> 02:10:59.149]  Again, you can also set your alarm so the show comes on with the refeed.
[02:10:59.149 --> 02:11:01.710]  We're going to have it where it feeds you the podcast.
[02:11:01.710 --> 02:11:03.071]  We're just going to add more and more to this.
[02:11:03.071 --> 02:11:04.651]  It's got a bunch of functions.
[02:11:04.651 --> 02:11:06.212]  It's absolutely free.
[02:11:06.212 --> 02:11:10.094]  It's at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:11:10.094 --> 02:11:14.136]  You can go download the first of many apps.
[02:11:14.136 --> 02:11:19.739]  This is just our trial operation here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:25.845]  This is just the start of what we're doing with iPhone apps.
[02:11:25.845 --> 02:11:29.169]  Absolutely free at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:29.169 --> 02:11:30.110]  Show them the article again.
[02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:32.773]  It's the top story on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:32.773 --> 02:11:36.236]  Listen to the Alex Jones Show with the new iPhone app, free!
[02:11:36.236 --> 02:11:38.759]  You might tell Kurt to add the headline, free.
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:41.401]  That is the key.
[02:11:41.401 --> 02:11:44.382]  We've had so many people approach us about selling iPhone apps.
[02:11:44.382 --> 02:11:45.962]  No, we're not interested in that.
[02:11:45.962 --> 02:11:50.924]  We want to stream the radio show to everyone for free.
[02:11:50.924 --> 02:11:56.406]  Everything on the internet is going to phones, as you know, in the last two years.
[02:11:56.406 --> 02:11:59.447]  And we're just going to add more and more and more.
[02:11:59.447 --> 02:12:06.769]  We will have an app for people that are PrisonPlanet.tv members, though, to have access to all the videos and the rest of it.
[02:12:06.769 --> 02:12:08.830]  So you can just download them right to your phone or stream them live.
[02:12:10.418 --> 02:12:12.320]  Let me just go ahead and read Curt Nemo's story.
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:15.803]  Do we have Wayne Madsen with us yet?
[02:12:15.803 --> 02:12:16.564]  Fantastic.
[02:12:16.564 --> 02:12:19.787]  So we're going to go to him in just a moment.
[02:12:19.787 --> 02:12:21.769]  But I first wanted to just read part of this article.
[02:12:21.769 --> 02:12:25.973]  Listen to the Alex Jones Show with the new iPhone app.
[02:12:25.973 --> 02:12:29.477]  Want to listen to the Alex Jones Show on your iPhone or iPod Touch?
[02:12:29.477 --> 02:12:33.241]  Apple's iTunes Store and Stormy Productions are now offering.
[02:12:35.367 --> 02:12:46.341]  An app dedicated to listening to Alex's nationally syndicated radio program over the internet.
[02:12:46.341 --> 02:12:51.126]  The app is an excellent opportunity to listen to the Alex Jones Show while you're on the run.
[02:12:51.923 --> 02:13:00.868]  The new app plays the live radio stream, has a built-in web browser alarm clock, and runs in the background so you can use other apps while listening.
[02:13:00.868 --> 02:13:08.273]  The service requires iPhone OS 3.0 or later, and the internet connection using Wi-Fi 3G or Edge.
[02:13:08.273 --> 02:13:14.656]  3G or 3rd generation is a service offered by ITT.
[02:13:14.656 --> 02:13:19.800]  And it goes on to say Edge is a digital mobile phone system that is widely used in Europe and other parts of the world.
[02:13:20.954 --> 02:13:32.380]  And we are very, very excited about that.
[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:35.001]  So again, that is available at InfoWars.com.
[02:13:38.945 --> 02:13:44.791]  Right now, and I want Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson to write articles about this, because this is great.
[02:13:44.791 --> 02:13:49.455]  And again, the fight is on the internet, that's where we're waking people up.
[02:13:49.455 --> 02:13:58.104]  Please let your friends, your family, please let other people know about this.
[02:14:06.533 --> 02:14:20.947]  Please tell your email list, your MySpace, your Twitter, your Facebook about the new free iPhone app available at InfoWars.com today.
[02:14:20.947 --> 02:14:26.833]  We're going to again be launching more in the near future, but very, very exciting this type of portability out there.
[02:14:28.034 --> 02:14:36.877]  Let's go ahead and go to Wayne Madsen, who I appreciate joining us today here on the Radio Slash TV Show.
[02:14:36.877 --> 02:14:41.579]  Wayne Madsen is an investigative journalist, nationally distributed columnist, and author who has covered Washington, D.C.
[02:14:41.579 --> 02:14:45.681]  politics, national security, and intelligence issues since 1994.
[02:14:45.681 --> 02:14:50.543]  He has written for the Village Voice, the Progressive CAQ, Counterpunch, and the Intelligence Newsletter.
[02:14:50.543 --> 02:14:51.383]  Madsen is the author.
[02:14:51.963 --> 02:14:52.303]  I think?
[02:15:12.381 --> 02:15:20.248]  Data privacy has also worked with the National Data Automation Command, Department of State, RCA Corporation, and Computer Science Corporation.
[02:15:20.248 --> 02:15:25.512]  And he joins us now to talk about a host of issues that are happening geopolitically and domestically.
[02:15:25.512 --> 02:15:26.974]  Wayne, good to have you here with us.
[02:15:26.974 --> 02:15:28.415]  Hi Alex, good to be with you again.
[02:15:29.107 --> 02:15:30.947]  Thanks for spending time.
[02:15:30.947 --> 02:15:32.008]  So much is going on.
[02:15:32.008 --> 02:15:35.509]  I have my big list of questions and points I want to go over with you.
[02:15:35.509 --> 02:15:40.030]  Obviously the latest on the crotch bomber, Sybil Edmonds' information.
[02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:42.790]  I had Michael Springman on yesterday.
[02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:52.553]  He just came right out now and said inside job 9-11, the Muslims, Al-Qaeda is a CIA brigade used to destabilize countries including the U.S.
[02:15:52.553 --> 02:15:53.633]  and bring in police state.
[02:15:54.113 --> 02:15:55.574]  The underwear bomber, it's on record.
[02:15:55.574 --> 02:15:56.354]  I want you to go over that.
[02:15:56.354 --> 02:15:57.595]  Just completely government ops.
[02:15:57.595 --> 02:16:01.677]  State Department admits they were ordered by CIA to let him in and protect him.
[02:16:01.677 --> 02:16:05.599]  The naked body scanners, it's come out that they're recording it and saving it.
[02:16:05.599 --> 02:16:09.101]  I mean, so much is going on, but what else is on your front burner?
[02:16:09.101 --> 02:16:11.222]  What else do you think is important we should know about Wayne Madsen?
[02:16:11.792 --> 02:16:18.213]  Well, I have a story up today on my website, and this is going to boggle people's minds.
[02:16:18.213 --> 02:16:37.337]  We're being told that all this stuff about derivatives and sovereign debt, they're talking in terms of trillions of dollars, but really the amount of money that's at stake, that's put at risk right now, right now it's in the quadrillions.
[02:16:37.337 --> 02:16:39.298]  And this came from a Federal Reserve source.
[02:16:40.278 --> 02:16:45.604]  And I mean, that operation thrives on secrecy.
[02:16:45.604 --> 02:16:47.286]  But here's the thing.
[02:16:47.286 --> 02:16:50.729]  We're talking about quadrillions now.
[02:16:50.729 --> 02:16:54.353]  There was a question posed internally at the Federal Reserve.
[02:16:54.353 --> 02:16:56.796]  These are economists, of course.
[02:16:57.296 --> 02:16:59.558]  What comes after a quadrillion?
[02:16:59.558 --> 02:17:02.980]  And of course the answer to that is a quintillion.
[02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:04.341]  And that's where they're heading.
[02:17:04.341 --> 02:17:16.330]  And I have a story up today because the first time I ran across a quadrillion was in relation to a big scandal that's taking place in France right now and it has to do with
[02:17:17.203 --> 02:17:34.362]  A bank account called Clearstream in Luxembourg that was apparently used to put neocons in power in various countries, undermine national economies, commit massive fraud, and looting of national treasuries.
[02:17:34.972 --> 02:17:43.458]  And the former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepinte cited this document and then later the neocons said, oh that's a forgery.
[02:17:43.458 --> 02:17:45.940]  See, the neocons produce forgeries.
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:47.681]  They want everyone to believe them.
[02:17:47.681 --> 02:17:53.085]  But when there's a document that comes out that they don't like, they say that's a forgery.
[02:17:53.085 --> 02:17:55.867]  So, Nicolas Sarkozy, the neocon,
[02:17:56.357 --> 02:17:56.878]  We're good to go.
[02:18:14.668 --> 02:18:15.308]  I don't think so.
[02:18:30.055 --> 02:18:42.346]  And if they succeed in convicting DeVille Pan, of course that knocks him out of the presidential race, but with DeVille Pan as president of France, the neocons are going to maybe lose France.
[02:18:42.346 --> 02:18:48.272]  They just lost Ukraine because the Orange Revolution that was financed by George Soros was
[02:18:48.972 --> 02:19:11.967]  Is dead, because Viktor Yanukovych, who's a Ukrainian nationalist who has no time for Ukraine and NATO, or any of these other contrivances, won that election, beat the Orange Revolution woman, Yulia Tymoshenko, so Ukraine is no longer in the hip pocket of the neocons, and now the battle looks like it's going to move to France.
[02:19:13.703 --> 02:19:29.237]  I want to come back and continue with the whole geopolitical lay of the land and integrate that with China saying they want a hard line, cold war with the US, their PLA commanders, the top generals, and their military council calling for dumping the US bonds to quote, punish the United States.
[02:19:29.237 --> 02:19:30.419]  We've got Hillary threatening
[02:19:31.019 --> 02:19:34.462]  them with sanctions if they don't put sanctions on Iran.
[02:19:34.462 --> 02:19:36.523]  Are they planning to go into Iran, Wayne Madsen?
[02:19:36.523 --> 02:19:37.684]  We'll talk about that.
[02:19:37.684 --> 02:19:48.992]  Why is Sarah Palin and four neocon publications, including National Review, calling for Obama to play the war card and preemptively attack Iran?
[02:19:48.992 --> 02:19:52.134]  What's the intel you're getting in D.C.
[02:19:52.134 --> 02:19:57.678]  as you're snowed in by the incredible global warming, record snowfall in the last 50 years in D.C.
[02:19:57.678 --> 02:19:58.118]  right now?
[02:19:58.118 --> 02:19:59.859]  Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:19:59.859 --> 02:20:00.280]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.698 --> 02:20:04.559]  If you like vitamins, say ilikevitamins.com.
[02:20:04.559 --> 02:20:06.319]  Vitamin lovers, it's your choice.
[02:20:06.319 --> 02:20:14.461]  Take pills and capsules with only about a 10-20% absorption rate, or take 10-in-1 liquid vitamin and mineral supplement at up to a 98% absorption rate.
[02:20:14.461 --> 02:20:16.882]  Yes, 10 formulas in 1 bottle.
[02:20:16.882 --> 02:20:19.603]  10-in-1 liquid supplement is in your system in as little as 3 minutes.
[02:20:20.623 --> 02:20:20.903]  We're good.
[02:20:38.359 --> 02:20:39.240]  We're good to go.
[02:21:01.172 --> 02:21:11.199]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:21:11.199 --> 02:21:17.644]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:21:17.644 --> 02:21:26.490]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:36.053]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:21:36.053 --> 02:21:40.635]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:21:40.635 --> 02:21:42.455]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:42.455 --> 02:21:44.956]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:21:45.236 --> 02:21:46.077]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:46.077 --> 02:21:48.238]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:21:48.238 --> 02:21:48.999]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.999 --> 02:21:49.739]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:49.739 --> 02:21:52.001]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:52.001 --> 02:21:53.762]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:53.762 --> 02:21:54.883]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:11.713 --> 02:22:14.396]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:14.396 --> 02:22:20.781]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:20.781 --> 02:22:25.966]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:25.966 --> 02:22:35.975]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:36.075 --> 02:22:38.417]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:38.417 --> 02:22:39.998]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:39.998 --> 02:22:42.480]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:44.322]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:44.322 --> 02:22:49.746]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:49.746 --> 02:22:54.770]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:58.853]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:05.351]  Our economy is in great distress.
[02:23:05.351 --> 02:23:08.893]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[02:23:08.893 --> 02:23:14.415]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen, and prepare just in case it does.
[02:23:14.415 --> 02:23:17.077]  You have auto and home insurance.
[02:23:17.077 --> 02:23:20.299]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[02:23:20.299 --> 02:23:23.580]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:26.242]  Because it might take years to recover.
[02:23:26.242 --> 02:23:31.905]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[02:23:32.762 --> 02:23:40.109]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[02:23:40.109 --> 02:23:48.216]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[02:23:48.216 --> 02:23:52.700]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:58.526]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:24:03.433 --> 02:24:23.339]  We're also going to get into the cyber security bill that's passed the House, which they admit the President can then shut down the web to, quote, protect it, recruiting youth corps that are going to, for the Pentagon, battle disinformation in the U.S.
[02:24:23.339 --> 02:24:24.280]  and attack bloggers.
[02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:27.422]  Generals saying they may start killing U.S.
[02:24:27.422 --> 02:24:27.983]  reporters.
[02:24:27.983 --> 02:24:31.026]  I mean, this is getting crazy because we're hurting the system.
[02:24:31.026 --> 02:24:38.994]  Wayne, continuing with the whole geopolitical breakdown of what's happening, and China talking about dumping its bonds.
[02:24:38.994 --> 02:24:41.056]  Geithner comes out and says, don't worry, we're safe.
[02:24:41.056 --> 02:24:41.657]  What's going on?
[02:24:42.526 --> 02:24:50.752]  Well, it looks like what the Obama administration is trying to do is try to recreate some semblance of a Cold War.
[02:24:50.752 --> 02:24:58.398]  Obviously, the whole thing about non-state terrorist actors, Al-Qaeda, is falling apart on them.
[02:24:58.398 --> 02:25:00.379]  So they've got to go after state players.
[02:25:00.379 --> 02:25:01.520]  And China, of course, is
[02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:05.203]  Is a emerging superpower.
[02:25:05.203 --> 02:25:19.134]  The Obama administration has announced the sale of weapons to Taiwan, which is a real slap at the Chinese, who basically have us, you know, they have us, you know, where the sun doesn't shine.
[02:25:19.134 --> 02:25:31.264]  Financially, they own our debt, they own our notes, and this is just sort of like Cold War era brinkmanship, only not with nuclear weapons, but with threats of
[02:25:34.045 --> 02:25:41.770]  Is this the hope and change message that everybody was expecting to see?
[02:25:41.770 --> 02:25:45.692]  A chill on US-Chinese relations?
[02:25:45.692 --> 02:25:52.496]  Now, China's no angel, of course, but we deal with a lot of countries around the world that have dictators.
[02:25:52.496 --> 02:25:54.257]  We can choose them very carefully.
[02:25:54.257 --> 02:25:56.218]  We refuse to have relations with Cuba.
[02:25:56.718 --> 02:26:17.397]  But we have no problem dealing with the Saudis and the Egyptians, their dictatorships, but we hold our nose now at Iran and Hillary, of course, stating that she wants China to join the Western powers in ratcheting up tensions with Iran.
[02:26:17.397 --> 02:26:19.879]  I would note that Iran with this whole issue of
[02:26:20.779 --> 02:26:21.859]  Enriching uranium.
[02:26:21.859 --> 02:26:24.600]  Right now they're at 3% enriched uranium.
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:32.161]  They're jumping that up to 20% enrichment because they need it for nuclear medicine.
[02:26:32.161 --> 02:26:35.302]  And also for their power plant.
[02:26:35.302 --> 02:26:39.522]  You need 90% enriched uranium to develop a bomb.
[02:26:39.522 --> 02:26:41.123]  And they're nowhere close to that.
[02:26:41.123 --> 02:26:48.284]  But isn't it interesting what they didn't like was this deal being worked out where Iran would ship its current uranium to be enriched
[02:26:48.835 --> 02:26:51.158]  And it would be enriched in France.
[02:26:51.158 --> 02:26:53.642]  Well, France is controlled by Sarkozy.
[02:26:53.642 --> 02:27:02.393]  And why in the world would the Iranians want to trust this guy who's now been pegged as a total neocon fraud?
[02:27:04.671 --> 02:27:05.992]  Let me throw this out there.
[02:27:05.992 --> 02:27:08.413]  They've always brought the UN in.
[02:27:08.413 --> 02:27:11.495]  They've given into the UN, unlike any other nation ever has.
[02:27:11.495 --> 02:27:13.577]  They always report their new facilities.
[02:27:13.577 --> 02:27:16.078]  They say, okay, so it's not weapons grade.
[02:27:16.078 --> 02:27:19.260]  We'll let China, your ally, do it.
[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:21.341]  And they go, no, we must have war.
[02:27:21.341 --> 02:27:22.342]  We've seen Sarah Palin.
[02:27:22.962 --> 02:27:28.803]  We've seen all these other neocons come out and say we must have war.
[02:27:28.803 --> 02:27:32.964]  Huckabee, the National Review, we must have war now.
[02:27:32.964 --> 02:27:39.186]  And Israel's saying we want, quote, crippling sanctions.
[02:27:39.186 --> 02:27:39.826]  Well, right.
[02:27:39.826 --> 02:27:47.268]  And isn't it interesting, all this happens after Poppy Bush and Jeb Bush make this unannounced visit to the White House.
[02:27:47.970 --> 02:27:49.472]  I believe it was about a week ago.
[02:27:49.472 --> 02:27:50.413]  What's the word on that?
[02:27:50.413 --> 02:27:51.715]  What was really happening?
[02:27:51.715 --> 02:27:52.836]  No one really knows.
[02:27:52.836 --> 02:27:56.160]  They said it was just a personal meeting.
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:58.262]  There's no personal meetings.
[02:27:58.262 --> 02:28:01.406]  We just sauntered into the White House like that.
[02:28:01.406 --> 02:28:05.872]  And I think it's very interesting that George W. Bush, when he was on Meet the Press with
[02:28:06.772 --> 02:28:16.495]  Bill Clinton, trying to raise money for Haiti relief, said something about, well, you've got to be careful about who you give money to, because there's a lot of shysters that show up.
[02:28:16.495 --> 02:28:33.741]  Well, if George W. Bush was even paying an iota of attention when he was president for eight years, he might know who the shysters are, and it would be interesting to get him to actually say, because of course he was sitting next to one of the biggest shysters around, Bill Clinton.
[02:28:34.221 --> 02:28:41.949]  Who would poppy Bush raised all this money for the tsunami victims, but very little I understand actually reached the people who needed it.
[02:28:41.949 --> 02:28:50.357]  It's just another one of these scams and obviously Bush, who's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, nor the brightest lamp in the chandelier,
[02:28:50.877 --> 02:28:53.299]  Even said, you know, you gotta be careful.
[02:28:53.299 --> 02:29:06.569]  Shysters, you know what, it'd be interesting if Bush actually, you know, in some moment of lucidity, would actually start talking about the Shysters he encountered as President of the United States.
[02:29:06.569 --> 02:29:12.774]  He might go a little bit towards redeeming himself, although I don't think he'll ever redeem himself.
[02:29:12.774 --> 02:29:14.255]  He's got too much blood on his hands.
[02:29:15.476 --> 02:29:26.024]  Let's remember, Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican who left that party in total disgust and ran as a bull moose progressively, ranting and raving about the power of the corporations.
[02:29:26.024 --> 02:29:36.592]  So there is a possibility he could go that direction, but certainly no one knows what that meeting in the White House was about.
[02:29:36.592 --> 02:29:39.575]  Maybe they were giving Obama his marching orders.
[02:29:40.526 --> 02:29:46.332]  Let's get into cyber security and a lot more coming up, plus the underwear bomber.
[02:29:46.332 --> 02:29:48.354]  Straight ahead with Wayne Madsen, our guest.
[02:29:48.354 --> 02:29:51.858]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.858 --> 02:29:53.259]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.259 --> 02:29:55.782]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.782 --> 02:29:58.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.667 --> 02:30:04.689]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.689 --> 02:30:10.011]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:10.011 --> 02:30:12.052]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:12.052 --> 02:30:17.055]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:17.055 --> 02:30:18.236]  How much do you want?
[02:30:18.236 --> 02:30:19.376]  When do you want it?
[02:30:19.376 --> 02:30:21.257]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:21.257 --> 02:30:22.318]  When will you need it?
[02:30:22.318 --> 02:30:24.519]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.519 --> 02:30:25.860]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:27.400]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:28.441]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:30:28.601 --> 02:30:29.922]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:30:29.922 --> 02:30:32.645]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.645 --> 02:30:36.229]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:36.229 --> 02:30:40.053]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:40.053 --> 02:30:41.295]  How much will you need?
[02:30:41.295 --> 02:30:42.196]  We don't know.
[02:30:42.196 --> 02:30:43.297]  How much do you want?
[02:30:43.297 --> 02:30:44.238]  All you can get.
[02:30:44.238 --> 02:30:45.039]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.319 --> 02:30:48.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:51.482]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:51.482 --> 02:30:52.402]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.626 --> 02:31:04.729]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:31:04.729 --> 02:31:07.611]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:31:07.611 --> 02:31:09.692]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:31:09.692 --> 02:31:11.934]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:31:11.934 --> 02:31:13.595]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:31:13.595 --> 02:31:17.898]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:31:18.058 --> 02:31:20.639]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[02:31:48.429 --> 02:31:50.351]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:32:00.356 --> 02:32:04.899]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.899 --> 02:32:05.819]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.819 --> 02:32:09.242]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.242 --> 02:32:10.102]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.102 --> 02:32:14.985]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.985 --> 02:32:15.746]  It's true.
[02:32:15.746 --> 02:32:20.609]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.609 --> 02:32:21.429]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:25.012]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.012 --> 02:32:28.734]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.914 --> 02:32:29.715]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.715 --> 02:32:32.477]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.477 --> 02:32:36.160]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:36.961]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.961 --> 02:32:41.105]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.105 --> 02:32:45.869]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.149 --> 02:32:50.310]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.310 --> 02:32:52.110]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:54.351]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.351 --> 02:32:56.972]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:56.972 --> 02:33:10.495]  By the way, I just want to add for listeners this important point.
[02:33:10.495 --> 02:33:13.416]  The iPhone app is free at infowars.com.
[02:33:18.058 --> 02:33:20.219]  Okay, it's absolutely free.
[02:33:20.219 --> 02:33:21.981]  And if you have an iPhone, it's very easy.
[02:33:21.981 --> 02:33:23.542]  You just download our app.
[02:33:23.542 --> 02:33:26.443]  It's free at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:26.443 --> 02:33:29.986]  I guess there's some other people selling apps we just learned of I didn't even know about.
[02:33:29.986 --> 02:33:31.206]  That's separate from us.
[02:33:31.206 --> 02:33:32.707]  Ours is free.
[02:33:32.707 --> 02:33:33.748]  People selling them in our name.
[02:33:33.748 --> 02:33:39.792]  I've got to stop that because I just can't let people, you know, take our name and use it and do stuff and then claim they're us later.
[02:33:39.792 --> 02:33:41.213]  We've had that happen over and over again.
[02:33:41.693 --> 02:33:47.118]  It's free, just like you can watch my films for free online, or get the DVDs and make copies of them.
[02:33:47.118 --> 02:33:53.323]  We hope you get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership to see it first and in higher quality, and to download it and use it.
[02:33:53.323 --> 02:33:56.766]  We hope you buy the DVDs, but that's not the mission.
[02:33:56.766 --> 02:34:06.614]  The mission is, yes, to fund our operation, but funding the operation is only the launchpad to battle the globalists, and shatter the left-right paradigm, and warn the people.
[02:34:06.614 --> 02:34:08.136]  Going back to Wayne Madsen,
[02:34:09.984 --> 02:34:14.966]  I mean, there's so much to cover here, so much going on, so much happening.
[02:34:14.966 --> 02:34:21.928]  What would you say the state is of the US, Israel, and England that are all allied together with the EU?
[02:34:21.928 --> 02:34:23.628]  Because all over the world,
[02:34:25.609 --> 02:34:31.116]  Resistance is mounting to the fact that our nations have been captured and are being used as engines of tyranny.
[02:34:31.116 --> 02:34:39.186]  And you talked about how all over the world, people are now recognizing this new equivalent to the former Soviet tyranny, the evil empire.
[02:34:39.186 --> 02:34:41.209]  The people in America are waking up.
[02:34:41.209 --> 02:34:44.112]  Both political parties' approval ratings are plunging.
[02:34:45.143 --> 02:34:47.725]  And so the system is going to strike back.
[02:34:47.725 --> 02:34:51.308]  How are they doing that with the new cybersecurity system, I guess?
[02:34:51.308 --> 02:34:54.470]  Because I've read the cybersecurity bill in the House that passed.
[02:34:54.470 --> 02:34:55.931]  The Senate's even worse.
[02:34:55.931 --> 02:34:58.633]  I mean, I can't believe what's in this.
[02:34:58.633 --> 02:35:00.474]  I'm going to be covering it more next hour.
[02:35:00.474 --> 02:35:02.155]  I know you know about it.
[02:35:02.155 --> 02:35:08.780]  But I don't think people realize that Microsoft is building all these cybersecurity centers, being paid by the federal government openly to censor.
[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:10.501]  Bill Gates is saying it's good.
[02:35:10.501 --> 02:35:11.842]  Time Magazine, Newsweek.
[02:35:13.083 --> 02:35:24.211]  The British papers, New York Times saying you're going to have to have an internet ID to get online, biometric scan, all IT facilities even down to people that serve a hundred customers or more.
[02:35:24.211 --> 02:35:25.932]  That's the most tiny ISP.
[02:35:25.932 --> 02:35:33.038]  We'll have to put government monitoring software openly snooping and that runs your system so they can ban any websites they want.
[02:35:33.038 --> 02:35:35.860]  Now InfoWars and Prison Planet along with WikiLeaks.
[02:35:36.380 --> 02:35:41.928]  And Electronic Frontiers Foundation are suddenly getting banned by ISPs from New Zealand to Italy?
[02:35:41.928 --> 02:35:43.370]  I mean, they're moving, sir!
[02:35:44.995 --> 02:35:59.150]  Absolutely, and you know, I spent a long time in computer security, and there's a lot of reasons to have a lot of countermeasures in place, but what we're seeing here is something much more than that.
[02:35:59.150 --> 02:36:03.294]  We have the National Security Agency cutting a deal with Google.
[02:36:03.294 --> 02:36:07.038]  They've already had deals with Motorola, with Intel, with Microsoft.
[02:36:07.638 --> 02:36:15.521]  This is basically building intelligence inside, to paraphrase the old Intel slogan, Intel Inside.
[02:36:15.521 --> 02:36:17.162]  And that's what we're going to see.
[02:36:17.162 --> 02:36:34.970]  And then you couple these initiatives, like the cybersecurity bill with Cass Sunstein, who's the head of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, who basically has come out and said it's the job of the government to basically break
[02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:39.772]  He uses the word conspiracy theorist.
[02:36:39.772 --> 02:36:47.937]  He wrote a book called Infotopia where he talks about the danger of people who don't engage in the group think being pushed by the corporate media.
[02:36:47.937 --> 02:36:56.302]  And I think when you have Sunstein, who by the way I hear, there may be two vacancies on the Supreme Court.
[02:36:56.302 --> 02:36:58.483]  Stevens may be leaving as well as Ginsburg.
[02:36:59.346 --> 02:37:02.489]  And he may be on the short list, from what I'm hearing.
[02:37:02.489 --> 02:37:05.451]  He was on the list last time with Sotomayor!
[02:37:05.451 --> 02:37:18.242]  Right, and this is a nightmare to have a guy like that basically preaching censorship and infiltrating groups that they don't agree with.
[02:37:18.242 --> 02:37:20.284]  This is right out of COINTELPRO in the 1960s.
[02:37:21.705 --> 02:37:28.888]  In the 1970s, the FBI infiltrated various anti-war groups, civil rights groups, and others.
[02:37:28.888 --> 02:37:35.630]  But you couple all these things together, and you don't need a crystal ball to see where they're going.
[02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:37.171]  They have to control the Internet.
[02:37:37.171 --> 02:37:44.694]  The Internet was developed with DOD money, but it's turned out to be something that is helping to
[02:37:45.314 --> 02:38:03.640]  Illuminate what's going on with these various power centers around the world, especially, as I said, what the neocons are up to with their total disinformation campaign, going after politicians who aren't falling in line.
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:06.901]  And I think it's something that everybody has to be concerned about.
[02:38:06.901 --> 02:38:12.203]  As a matter of fact, I've gone ahead and bought an old Underwood typewriter because if they
[02:38:12.603 --> 02:38:15.746]  And by the way, Wayne, you're not joking.
[02:38:15.746 --> 02:38:17.367]  I put out an internet video.
[02:38:29.585 --> 02:38:29.805]  I don't
[02:38:48.831 --> 02:38:59.293]  And all these indexes of banned sites are going into the ISPs right now, and all the big newspapers are calling for censoring alternative media, because we're kicking their butts!
[02:38:59.293 --> 02:39:01.633]  The truth is trumping their lies.
[02:39:01.633 --> 02:39:02.793]  They're all going bankrupt.
[02:39:02.793 --> 02:39:08.334]  So it's a perfect storm of government, corporations, and media that can't compete with the truth.
[02:39:08.334 --> 02:39:16.716]  They are really starting to drop the hammer, and I think it's important to get the word out now to scream bloody murder, because if we don't respond to them just
[02:39:17.276 --> 02:39:24.333]  Test firing or beta testing or trial ballooning the idea of censoring the web.
[02:39:24.333 --> 02:39:25.856]  I mean, this is clearly a test right now.
[02:39:25.856 --> 02:39:26.217]  Do you agree?
[02:39:27.119 --> 02:39:33.185]  Oh, I think there's, yeah, they're floating all kinds of trial balloons here to see just how far they can go.
[02:39:33.185 --> 02:39:37.289]  And if, you know, you give them an inch, they're going to take 10,000 miles.
[02:39:37.289 --> 02:39:47.880]  And certainly, you know, I look at the, I pick up the Washington Post now, and it rivals Pravda during the days of the Soviet Union with its
[02:39:48.604 --> 02:39:50.644]  Total disinformation.
[02:39:50.644 --> 02:39:53.385]  The Washington Post is owned by an education company.
[02:39:53.385 --> 02:39:56.586]  They no longer really are in the news business.
[02:39:56.586 --> 02:40:00.306]  They have Kaplan Business.
[02:40:00.306 --> 02:40:04.507]  It's a training and education company.
[02:40:04.507 --> 02:40:14.689]  And you can't believe anything they print about education issues because they're trying to push the privatization of public education.
[02:40:14.689 --> 02:40:17.170]  And it doesn't stop there.
[02:40:17.170 --> 02:40:18.210]  Everything they write about
[02:40:19.176 --> 02:40:22.218]  For example, they covered the Ukrainian election.
[02:40:22.218 --> 02:40:30.403]  They started out by saying Viktor Yanukovych, a one-time party boss, who was accused of criminal activity.
[02:40:30.403 --> 02:40:31.683]  That's the first sentence.
[02:40:31.683 --> 02:40:36.266]  I mean, they don't say anything about who backs these neocons in these various countries.
[02:40:38.247 --> 02:40:39.107]  Let's shift gears.
[02:41:02.595 --> 02:41:04.097]  I want to get into the underwear bomber.
[02:41:04.097 --> 02:41:11.665]  I know the audience knows this, but the general public, it's been in ABC News, Detroit News, but buried in the articles.
[02:41:11.665 --> 02:41:13.848]  This has now been out for a week and a half.
[02:41:13.848 --> 02:41:15.129]  Oh yeah, it's true.
[02:41:15.129 --> 02:41:17.132]  There was a sharp-dressed man.
[02:41:17.132 --> 02:41:17.432]  The state
[02:41:17.432 --> 02:41:19.033]  The State Department was told by U.S.
[02:41:19.033 --> 02:41:22.736]  intelligence to let him in because they didn't want to tip off Al-Qaeda.
[02:41:22.736 --> 02:41:30.362]  And yeah, there was a second man on the plane that did have a bomb, and Kurt Haskell did tell the truth, but we're not going to talk about that.
[02:41:30.362 --> 02:41:33.505]  I mean, this is another false flag, another setup.
[02:41:34.801 --> 02:41:35.502]  I don't know.
[02:41:51.698 --> 02:41:57.524]  So we got all this disinformation about Muttalib, and now we hear he's cooperating with U.S.
[02:41:57.524 --> 02:41:59.565]  intelligence to turn it over.
[02:41:59.565 --> 02:42:14.680]  It sounds like he's being debriefed, more than anything else, that he was an agent of influence who was used, and now whatever he's talking about, it sounds like a typical intelligence agent debriefing as far as I'm concerned, and I think it was a
[02:42:15.982 --> 02:42:27.380]  Of course, Chair Top was out there saying, oh, we've got to get these scanners in, even though he's got a financial interest in some of the companies that are pushing these body scanners.
[02:42:28.351 --> 02:42:39.213]  And in the debriefing, he comes out and says, Al-Qaeda will hit in the next three to six months, devastating exactly what they wanted to hear.
[02:42:39.213 --> 02:42:46.094]  And then they run out, and they have all the intelligence chiefs before Congress last week and said, we will be hit.
[02:42:46.094 --> 02:42:53.176]  And notice this all kicks off right as they mass forces in Yemen, just like they mass forces in and around Afghanistan right before 9-11.
[02:42:53.176 --> 02:42:54.956]  And again, it's hidden in plain view.
[02:42:56.076 --> 02:43:12.846]  And in a few major newspapers and publications, but just buried in the article, okay, Mr. Kennedy, the head of the subdivision of the State Department, says they were ordered by the CIA to let him get in, even though he didn't have a visa, and yeah, somebody got him through security and got him on board the plane.
[02:43:12.846 --> 02:43:21.531]  I mean, who's a sharp-dressed man that can lead you up through security, past the body scanners, which that airport had, that's on record, and get him on the plane?
[02:43:21.531 --> 02:43:24.032]  Only high-level security can do that.
[02:43:24.172 --> 02:43:26.214]  And they admit they helped him get on.
[02:43:26.214 --> 02:43:28.275]  They just don't say they were the sharp-dressed man.
[02:43:28.275 --> 02:43:31.258]  They deny the sharp-dressed man, now they admit it.
[02:43:31.258 --> 02:43:32.859]  But they say, we're not worried about that.
[02:43:32.859 --> 02:43:34.580]  I mean, how obvious?
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:39.344]  And then his dad knows they're setting him up, goes and says he's gonna attack you, and nothing's done.
[02:43:39.344 --> 02:43:42.487]  But meanwhile, women are having their breasts groped at the airports.
[02:43:43.348 --> 02:44:00.288]  Right, and we know that the company responsible for security at Amsterdam was ICPS, this Israeli operation that also did the security at De Gaulle Airport in Paris and allowed Richard Reed, the shoe bomber, to get on that American Airlines flight to Miami.
[02:44:00.288 --> 02:44:02.270]  And isn't that interesting?
[02:44:03.411 --> 02:44:07.316]  Richard Reid had also boarded an El Al flight earlier to Tel Aviv.
[02:44:07.316 --> 02:44:20.492]  Now if this guy is so dangerous, I mean, El Al is supposed to have the strictest security in the world, but he was allowed to get on that plane because we were told then they wanted to see who he was meeting in Israel.
[02:44:20.492 --> 02:44:22.234]  That's the same story here, so let's...
[02:44:23.015 --> 02:44:24.416]  I mean, that's on record.
[02:44:24.416 --> 02:44:25.236]  Exactly, Wayne.
[02:44:25.236 --> 02:44:25.957]  Absolutely.
[02:44:25.957 --> 02:44:37.684]  And then, days after it happens, not just billions of naked body scanners worldwide, but Israel says, we may get a contract with Homeland Security to run everything because we know how to keep you safe.
[02:44:37.684 --> 02:44:41.167]  Meanwhile, it's an Israeli company that lets them all get on board.
[02:44:41.167 --> 02:44:46.270]  Well, I think it's just another indication of the, you know, what interest, who benefited from this.
[02:44:46.270 --> 02:44:47.751]  Of course, chair top benefits.
[02:44:48.525 --> 02:44:50.086]  And so did David Kelly and everybody else.
[02:44:50.086 --> 02:44:51.907]  It just continues.
[02:44:51.907 --> 02:44:53.268]  And expanding from there,
[02:45:16.587 --> 02:45:20.801]  Looking into your crystal ball, all your NSA, CIA contacts.
[02:45:21.997 --> 02:45:23.817]  Are they planning to attack Iran?
[02:45:23.817 --> 02:45:25.938]  Because they're openly saying they will.
[02:45:25.938 --> 02:45:30.559]  The neocons are threatening Obama, saying you will attack, or you're a first-termer.
[02:45:30.559 --> 02:45:35.280]  I'm sure you saw the Sarah Palin clips about, I would declare war on Iran and hit them now.
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:37.961]  That's what Obama should do, play the war card.
[02:45:37.961 --> 02:45:40.461]  We've got neocons saying, man, we sure need another 9-11.
[02:45:40.461 --> 02:45:43.662]  You know, we were as happy as pigs, and you know what?
[02:45:43.662 --> 02:45:46.063]  I mean, this is really... They might as well...
[02:45:47.483 --> 02:45:59.207]  Think back three years ago, Wayne, when they had five of the former Pentagon generals, who were the five network military correspondents, in that audio tape that one of the aides recorded, going, man, we sure need another 9-11.
[02:45:59.207 --> 02:45:59.928]  It sure helped us.
[02:45:59.928 --> 02:46:01.008]  What are we going to do, Rumsfeld?
[02:46:01.008 --> 02:46:03.969]  And he goes, it's hard.
[02:46:03.969 --> 02:46:05.109]  Let's talk later.
[02:46:05.109 --> 02:46:06.550]  I mean, we played that audio.
[02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:09.131]  They almost say they did it in that tape.
[02:46:09.753 --> 02:46:10.353]  Right.
[02:46:10.353 --> 02:46:22.857]  And also, it's interesting what's coming out of the Chilcot Inquiry in London, looking about how Britain was forced to go against and join this war against Iraq.
[02:46:22.857 --> 02:46:38.101]  And just out today, we're reading about how some memos were released that state that, you know, this whole thing about France blocking the war effort in the UN Security Council, there was a plan that France doesn't go along, we're going to engage in an anti-
[02:46:39.142 --> 02:46:49.391]  And by the way, France helped found this country.
[02:46:49.391 --> 02:46:59.781]  I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, of my Heinz 57, I'm mainly English and Welsh, so I'm not bashing the British people, but Britain is now sold as the founder of America.
[02:46:59.781 --> 02:47:02.384]  No, France are not a bunch of surrender monkeys.
[02:47:03.354 --> 02:47:20.968]  Absolutely, and of course the two people who were most against France getting involved with that and really basically called them on, called Britain, Bush and Blair on this whole phony argument about WMDs in Iraq.
[02:47:20.968 --> 02:47:27.653]  It was President Chirac and Dominique de Villepin, the man that Sarkozy is trying to put in prison.
[02:47:27.653 --> 02:47:29.254]  He does not want that.
[02:47:29.254 --> 02:47:32.377]  He does not want de Villepin to be the next president of France because of
[02:47:32.817 --> 02:47:35.038]  He takes over the Élysée Palace.
[02:47:35.038 --> 02:47:39.360]  He's in a position to expose even more of these crimes by the neocons.
[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:49.744]  Well, you notice that in 1950, 1946, when NATO got set up, that France said, give us our nukes, get out of our country.
[02:47:49.744 --> 02:47:56.487]  They found out NATO was planning to take over like the Vichy French had done in 1941 for Hitler.
[02:47:56.487 --> 02:47:58.868]  He found out about that and
[02:47:59.901 --> 02:48:03.807]  De Gaulle did, so the British tried to kill him repeatedly with the Jackal.
[02:48:03.807 --> 02:48:05.169]  That's on record.
[02:48:05.169 --> 02:48:08.774]  And it's clear Sarkozy isn't even French.
[02:48:08.774 --> 02:48:12.399]  He's this enemy agent coming in, and they joined NATO again.
[02:48:13.416 --> 02:48:13.817]  Right.
[02:48:13.817 --> 02:48:29.814]  And they, you know, sending more troops to Afghanistan and this whole thing was to basically eliminate France as one of the countries that stands in the way of the goals of the neocons to basically, you know, let's be frank, take over the world.
[02:48:29.814 --> 02:48:30.375]  That's what they're
[02:48:30.475 --> 02:48:31.055]  We're good to go.
[02:48:53.723 --> 02:49:03.534]  Yeah, they're getting upset like American workers should be because they're now in the banking rules saying the government may take your pensions and then tax it and give you part of it back.
[02:49:03.534 --> 02:49:05.557]  They're not going to insure money markets.
[02:49:05.557 --> 02:49:07.399]  I mean, my God, this is bad.
[02:49:08.311 --> 02:49:08.611]  Right.
[02:49:08.611 --> 02:49:24.178]  And also, we're also seeing an attack on Japan trying to bring down the value of the Yanvike, this whole thing about Toyota, when in fact the parts that are made for those Toyota cars are made by an Indian-owned U.S.
[02:49:24.178 --> 02:49:25.239]  company in Indiana.
[02:49:26.159 --> 02:49:28.701]  Does that sound like industrial espionage to you?
[02:49:28.701 --> 02:49:29.722]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:49:29.722 --> 02:49:32.664]  It's economic warfare, industrial espionage.
[02:49:32.664 --> 02:49:35.025]  They're trying to get at the end through Toyota.
[02:49:35.025 --> 02:49:40.529]  This is Ray Levine, the Republican Transportation Secretary, doing this.
[02:49:40.529 --> 02:49:51.557]  And it just goes to show that the people in charge of Treasury, Geithner and Bernanke and Obama and Emmanuelle and all these people are really not much different than what we had in the past with
[02:49:52.057 --> 02:49:57.122]  With Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Hank Paulson, and the rest of these criminals.
[02:49:57.122 --> 02:50:00.665]  Well, they're worse because the left has gone to sleep!
[02:50:00.665 --> 02:50:07.611]  Absolutely, and I noticed today that there's now some pushback by some Democrats in Congress against Rahm Emanuel.
[02:50:07.611 --> 02:50:15.498]  I mean, I knew that they were there, but now they're starting to go on record, which indicates that Emanuel has really poisoned the water.
[02:50:15.658 --> 02:50:16.118]  That's right.
[02:50:16.118 --> 02:50:19.742]  You know what, let's do five more minutes on the other side, Wayne, because I want to talk about Emmanuel.
[02:50:19.742 --> 02:50:28.329]  You know, you talked over a year ago about how he was cracking his knuckles in the ear of Obama when it came out in the New York Times, how he calls up and threatens members of Congress.
[02:50:28.329 --> 02:50:32.032]  They're not going along with that, and it's on drugs today that they're sick of his bullying.
[02:50:34.281 --> 02:50:35.362]  Wayne Madsen's our guest.
[02:50:35.362 --> 02:50:36.662]  Your call's coming up the next hour.
[02:50:36.662 --> 02:50:37.663]  Big news blitz.
[02:50:37.663 --> 02:50:40.224]  I haven't even gotten to half the news yet.
[02:50:40.224 --> 02:50:51.951]  Drudge Report is linked in red, one of their top stories, to the report that it's confirmed they are recording the naked bodies of people, printing them out, laughing at people at the airports.
[02:50:51.951 --> 02:50:54.773]  It happened to a major TV film star.
[02:50:54.773 --> 02:50:57.214]  That's on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:50:57.214 --> 02:50:59.956]  And we have the new free iPhone app.
[02:50:59.956 --> 02:51:00.656]  It's free.
[02:51:00.656 --> 02:51:01.377]  Listen to the show.
[02:51:02.017 --> 02:51:02.417]  I think so.
[02:51:20.503 --> 02:51:20.783]  I think so.
[02:51:46.288 --> 02:51:49.250]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:49.250 --> 02:51:51.432]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:51.432 --> 02:51:52.913]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:12.291 --> 02:52:14.753]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.753 --> 02:52:21.159]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.159 --> 02:52:26.343]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.343 --> 02:52:36.331]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.451 --> 02:52:38.793]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.793 --> 02:52:40.394]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.394 --> 02:52:42.836]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.836 --> 02:52:44.957]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.957 --> 02:52:50.121]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:01.129 --> 02:53:04.671]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:53:04.671 --> 02:53:06.973]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:53:06.973 --> 02:53:07.833]  Don't!
[02:53:07.833 --> 02:53:11.276]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[02:53:49.126 --> 02:53:53.327]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:53.327 --> 02:53:54.947]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:18.047 --> 02:54:20.349]  I've learned how the globalists operate.
[02:54:20.349 --> 02:54:29.756]  For 16 years, 14 on air, I have done nothing but pore over their operations, studying them, reading their own declassified manuals.
[02:54:29.756 --> 02:54:37.061]  Clearly, I have no doubt in my mind, just like I did before 9-11, they are preparing to launch massive terror attacks in this country.
[02:54:37.061 --> 02:54:45.468]  I've been saying it the last three months, before the underwear bomber, before two weeks ago announcing we will be hit the next three to six months by the Pentagon and by the FBI.
[02:54:47.131 --> 02:55:00.156]  And Obama, I should have covered this as the top story today, it's the top of drudge, is saying in the Associated Press, if you criticize him, you're going to allow Al Qaeda to attack.
[02:55:00.156 --> 02:55:04.618]  In 2003, during the election, Cheney told U.S.
[02:55:04.618 --> 02:55:13.001]  News & World Report in a print interview, and he went on Meet the Press and said, if you get in the way of what we're doing and criticize us and investigate us for torture or for this war,
[02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:18.711]  You are going to allow a nuke to go off, and he smiled.
[02:55:18.711 --> 02:55:21.972]  Now, clearly, the neocons are running the show.
[02:55:21.972 --> 02:55:23.433]  There's no doubt of that now.
[02:55:23.433 --> 02:55:25.413]  Their foil, Obama, is exposed.
[02:55:25.413 --> 02:55:39.057]  Wayne Madsen, do you agree with me that the only card they've got, I even use the term card, is fake terror and wars, and now they're saying, play the war card, knowing if they really attack Iran, we won't have to sit around waiting for fake terror attacks.
[02:55:39.057 --> 02:55:40.718]  Iran is going to go absolutely ape.
[02:55:41.721 --> 02:55:44.303]  Well, and we'll see that if they do.
[02:55:44.303 --> 02:55:51.989]  I noticed that one of the things being pushed now is for Russia to withdraw its engineers from the Bushehr nuclear power plant on the Gulf.
[02:55:51.989 --> 02:55:54.931]  It's being constructed now.
[02:55:54.931 --> 02:55:58.434]  That would be the green light for an attack on that power plant.
[02:55:58.434 --> 02:56:06.220]  Right now, they won't attack it because a lot of Russians will die and that will create a... But they blew up Serb post with Russians in them.
[02:56:06.220 --> 02:56:08.482]  They attacked South Ossetia with Russians.
[02:56:08.982 --> 02:56:11.183]  I'm sure, and that's all part of it.
[02:56:11.183 --> 02:56:20.969]  Now that we see a friendlier government to Russia and Ukraine, what I think is going to happen, we're going to see Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey.
[02:56:20.969 --> 02:56:24.671]  And Turkey, of course, has had it with the neocons as well.
[02:56:24.671 --> 02:56:31.295]  And that gets into what Cybill Edmonds said a long time ago about the Turkish, excuse me, the Turkish deep state.
[02:56:31.295 --> 02:56:34.557]  Now we know there's a group called Organikon that's been active in Turkey for
[02:56:35.217 --> 02:56:56.224]  For decades an old gladio behind the scenes underground movement that has been linked to Israeli intelligence and they find out that a lot of Turkish generals have been involved in this and one of the things they've tried to do is overthrow the government of Prime Minister Erdogan who basically has taken Turkey on a much more independent path.
[02:56:57.485 --> 02:57:08.653]  But I would say that with Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, the regime in Georgia, the Saakashvili regime that was put in there with Soros' money, their days may be numbered.
[02:57:08.653 --> 02:57:14.438]  So we may be seeing another outbreak of hostilities in the Caucasus very soon.
[02:57:14.438 --> 02:57:20.042]  It may not be Iran, it may still overtake Iran, but we may see something happen in the Caucasus first.
[02:57:23.464 --> 02:57:26.166]  So what's the word in D.C., Wayne, with all your contacts?
[02:57:26.166 --> 02:57:31.671]  I mean, are they mulling attacking Iran or going with these crippling sanctions, as Israel has called them?
[02:57:31.671 --> 02:57:33.092]  I mean, what's the 50-50?
[02:57:33.092 --> 02:57:34.053]  60-40?
[02:57:34.053 --> 02:57:36.255]  I mean, are they going to hit Iran and win?
[02:57:37.202 --> 02:57:39.023]  Well, I think they've always wanted to hit Iran.
[02:57:39.023 --> 02:57:46.206]  I've been writing about contingency plans that have gone hot on occasion during Bush and now under Obama.
[02:57:46.206 --> 02:57:51.068]  That is the neocon wet dream, really.
[02:57:51.068 --> 02:57:52.609]  That's what they want to do.
[02:57:52.609 --> 02:57:58.672]  And I think they will stop at nothing to seek a military confrontation with Iran.
[02:57:58.672 --> 02:57:59.852]  And Iran knows it.
[02:58:01.653 --> 02:58:20.752]  Terrible ideologues in the Iranian government, but we have to realize that there was Western involvement in that Green Revolution, yet another themed revolution a la George Soros, and I think we're going to see a lot of blowback from that involvement done by the West.
[02:58:22.006 --> 02:58:22.987]  Stay there, my friend.
[02:58:22.987 --> 02:58:30.510]  We're going to come back and talk to you for five more minutes, then calls and all the different important news is coming up right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:30.510 --> 02:58:31.651]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:31.651 --> 02:58:33.992]  The website's rinfowars.com.
[02:58:33.992 --> 02:58:37.594]  The ratings are pouring in for our new free iPhone app to listen.
[02:58:37.594 --> 02:58:39.154]  It's all five stars.
[02:58:39.154 --> 02:58:42.996]  We'll be right back.

[02:58:53.083 --> 02:58:57.044]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:57.044 --> 02:59:05.906]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:59:05.906 --> 02:59:10.547]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:59:10.547 --> 02:59:21.369]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:59:21.989 --> 02:59:31.511]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:31.511 --> 02:59:36.933]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:59:36.933 --> 02:59:44.414]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:44.414 --> 02:59:47.155]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:59:54.395 --> 02:59:56.797]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.797 --> 03:00:03.322]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:03.322 --> 03:00:11.028]  Alright, final questions for Wayne Madsen of waynemadsenreport.com.
[03:00:11.028 --> 03:00:11.809]  Check it out today.
[03:00:12.856 --> 03:00:15.317]  Wayne, I know you're working on this story.
[03:00:15.317 --> 03:00:19.259]  The G20, they openly announced world government a few months ago.
[03:00:19.259 --> 03:00:26.222]  But I saw the Australian newspapers all reported, headline, secret banker meeting in Australia.
[03:00:26.222 --> 03:00:30.384]  The heads of the central banks, 24 total.
[03:00:30.384 --> 03:00:31.965]  What are they meeting about?
[03:00:31.965 --> 03:00:36.707]  How does this tie into China and their military saying dump US bonds?
[03:00:36.707 --> 03:00:38.048]  Why is China saying this?
[03:00:38.048 --> 03:00:39.669]  What's really going on in this secret meeting?
[03:00:40.543 --> 03:00:44.565]  Well, you know, they're secret meetings, so we don't really know.
[03:00:44.565 --> 03:00:51.808]  We can postulate all we want to, but the fact is that these bankers have these secret conclaves.
[03:00:51.808 --> 03:00:57.751]  I understand Geithner went to another meeting up in Nunavut, which is the Canadian Arctic Territory.
[03:00:57.751 --> 03:01:01.312]  It's one of the most remote places on the planet.
[03:01:01.312 --> 03:01:03.793]  And what in the world was going on up there?
[03:01:03.793 --> 03:01:05.854]  What was going on with this meeting in Australia?
[03:01:05.854 --> 03:01:07.655]  Of course, they just had the meeting in Davos.
[03:01:08.535 --> 03:01:14.157]  Where the head of security was found dead in a hotel room next to the Congress Center.
[03:01:14.157 --> 03:01:20.440]  I mean, this is stuff like out of a Dan Brown novel.
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:23.161]  You can't make this kind of stuff up.
[03:01:23.161 --> 03:01:29.183]  But I do know that the people at the Federal Reserve are quite proud of the fact that they meet in secret.
[03:01:29.183 --> 03:01:30.784]  They call that place the Temple.
[03:01:31.324 --> 03:01:34.725]  And no information leaves the temple.
[03:01:34.725 --> 03:01:39.687]  And all this idea of more transparency I think is just a bunch of hogwash.
[03:01:39.687 --> 03:01:40.588]  They're trying to do it.
[03:01:40.588 --> 03:01:48.031]  There's a big PR campaign because they know that they're under the gun and there's more people talking about the Fed now than ever in the past.
[03:01:48.031 --> 03:01:49.831]  And they're trying to do damage control.
[03:01:49.831 --> 03:01:57.534]  But the fact that these bankers meet in secret I think speaks loudly to what their agenda is.
[03:01:57.534 --> 03:01:58.695]  They've got a secret agenda.
[03:02:00.438 --> 03:02:01.699]  Well, there's no doubt about that.
[03:02:01.699 --> 03:02:11.106]  I mean, we've gone from the public not even knowing that the Federal Reserve was private to some polls as high as 91% that want to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[03:02:11.106 --> 03:02:18.512]  I think the bottom line here is more and more the elites are cornered and this private corporate structure that's captured the U.S.
[03:02:18.512 --> 03:02:23.316]  and used it as a vehicle of tyranny is in a lot of trouble, but they're going to play the war card.
[03:02:23.316 --> 03:02:25.978]  They're going to play the staged terror attack card.
[03:02:25.978 --> 03:02:27.920]  Wayne, when do you think they're going to play the card?
[03:02:29.011 --> 03:02:37.077]  You know, it's hard to say when they're going to do that, but right now Washington has had well over two feet of snow.
[03:02:37.077 --> 03:02:41.480]  We may have another foot or more coming tonight.
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:44.102]  You can see how this town just grinds to a halt.
[03:02:46.824 --> 03:03:01.111]  Extreme weather, so anything that would happen here, just looking at how the city has just shut down, the federal government has shut down for the second day in a row right now, and maybe shut down for more days this week.
[03:03:01.111 --> 03:03:02.931]  It doesn't take much.
[03:03:02.931 --> 03:03:03.872]  And of course,
[03:03:04.492 --> 03:03:21.495]  That's the weather, but if it was a terror attack, either in Washington or some other major city, of course, they could play that card, as you said, and try to ram a bunch more legislation through.
[03:03:21.495 --> 03:03:29.777]  Will they pull the terror card first before they go into Iran, or will they hit Iran, and then Iran will actually fight back, and that'll be called terrorism?
[03:03:30.629 --> 03:03:33.110]  It's hard to say what their contingency is for this.
[03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:38.512]  Of course, Iran, the worst-case scenario is Iran will bottle up the Strait of Hormuz.
[03:03:38.512 --> 03:03:44.774]  They'll sink a couple of supertankers and hit the refineries in Saudi Arabia.
[03:03:44.774 --> 03:03:56.118]  And if that happens, of course, if you think gas prices are pretty high now, wait until they jump up to, you know, could be $7, $8 to $10 a gallon, and that's what we'll see.
[03:03:57.119 --> 03:03:57.859]  Last question.
[03:03:57.859 --> 03:04:00.320]  Why is China getting so mad at the U.S.?
[03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:02.882]  I mean, we've shipped all our industry there.
[03:04:02.882 --> 03:04:07.284]  We're letting them not have the carbon taxes when we're going to have them.
[03:04:07.284 --> 03:04:08.925]  Why is China threatening the U.S.
[03:04:08.925 --> 03:04:09.546]  so much right now?
[03:04:10.322 --> 03:04:12.264]  Well, I think they've found U.S.
[03:04:12.264 --> 03:04:18.531]  intelligence fingerprints on the riots in Xinjiang province and the Uyghur region.
[03:04:18.531 --> 03:04:27.039]  Of course, Soros was known to have been involved in the Tibet uprising and of course the selling of weapons to Taiwan.
[03:04:27.039 --> 03:04:30.423]  These are all, you know, China considers, and we recognize
[03:04:30.823 --> 03:04:36.705]  Taiwan is part of China, and this is just like tweaking the nose of the dragon.
[03:04:36.705 --> 03:04:41.927]  Remember during the Cold War, they said we tweaked the nose of the Russian bear.
[03:04:41.927 --> 03:04:49.270]  Now we're tweaking the nose of the Chinese dragon, and I think it's all this power politics to return to the old days of some neo-Cold War.
[03:04:50.558 --> 03:04:54.841]  I agree, they're saying they've kicked it back off and of course the real target is us, the American people.
[03:04:54.841 --> 03:04:59.563]  But the globalists know we'll tend to go along with their tyranny if they're menacing us with outside threats.
[03:04:59.563 --> 03:05:00.544]  Wayne Madsen, thank you.
[03:05:02.600 --> 03:05:06.601]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:05:06.601 --> 03:05:09.842]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:05:09.842 --> 03:05:14.643]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:05:14.643 --> 03:05:21.045]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:05:21.045 --> 03:05:23.286]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:05:23.826 --> 03:05:24.126]  Tim Geithner?
[03:05:24.126 --> 03:05:24.626]  Bernanke?
[03:05:24.626 --> 03:05:25.427]  They're arsonists!
[03:05:25.427 --> 03:05:26.587]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:05:26.587 --> 03:05:28.828]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:05:42.714 --> 03:05:47.098]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[03:05:47.098 --> 03:05:50.001]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:06:09.386 --> 03:06:13.752]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[03:07:06.231 --> 03:07:09.093]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[03:07:09.093 --> 03:07:11.716]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[03:07:11.716 --> 03:07:18.762]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad-spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[03:07:18.762 --> 03:07:19.963]  What does this mean in the garden?

[03:07:24.787 --> 03:07:31.335]  Blue Ribbon Garden Produce, jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bricks wheatgrass.
[03:07:31.335 --> 03:07:34.519]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[03:07:34.519 --> 03:07:37.342]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[03:07:37.342 --> 03:07:44.331]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.

[03:07:55.661 --> 03:07:56.722]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:56.722 --> 03:07:58.183]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.742 --> 03:08:22.064]  Here's the Washington Post and ABC News.
[03:08:22.064 --> 03:08:25.005]  This is coming up.
[03:08:25.005 --> 03:08:27.807]  Some critics serving the goals of Al-Qaeda.
[03:08:27.807 --> 03:08:31.649]  Some critics serving the goals of Al-Qaeda is the ABC News headline.
[03:08:31.649 --> 03:08:32.229]  Here's another one.
[03:08:32.229 --> 03:08:36.231]  Brennan, political fear-mongering serves the goals of Al-Qaeda.
[03:08:36.231 --> 03:08:40.814]  And it goes on to say, criticizing Obama aids Al-Qaeda.
[03:08:40.814 --> 03:08:43.215]  And Governor Ridge admits, the former head of Homeland Security,
[03:08:44.482 --> 03:08:44.642]  That's
[03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:07.962]  Sarah Palin would have endorsed her, she would have won for sure, but she's still got a chance.
[03:09:07.962 --> 03:09:16.184]  Thursday, we've got Richard Reeves in here in studio with us to talk about this and a whole host of other issues with what we're fighting with the New World Order.
[03:09:16.184 --> 03:09:23.207]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go back to your calls quickly because I want to get back in the news and then more calls coming up.
[03:09:23.207 --> 03:09:25.868]  Plus, I made a special video that's going to premiere here.
[03:09:27.503 --> 03:09:34.166]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, and then we're going to post it up on YouTube, where I break down what's happening with the Tea Parties.
[03:09:34.166 --> 03:09:40.589]  And we're getting comments, and I'm going to use this idea the listener just gave us, in the Twitter account.
[03:09:40.589 --> 03:09:48.073]  We're not going to go along with Sarah Palin's attempt to take over the Tea Parties.
[03:09:49.437 --> 03:09:55.942]  And we do need to start having coffee parties to wake up the Tea Party people from the neocon fraud.
[03:09:55.942 --> 03:09:57.203]  That's a great idea.
[03:09:57.203 --> 03:09:58.784]  So you heard it here first.
[03:09:58.784 --> 03:09:59.644]  The coffee parties.
[03:09:59.644 --> 03:10:01.005]  Great idea, listeners.
[03:10:01.005 --> 03:10:02.206]  Step in Texas.
[03:10:02.206 --> 03:10:04.908]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:10:04.908 --> 03:10:07.510]  Sure, you've had a great show over the last three, four weeks.
[03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:09.511]  Just mind-blowing stuff.
[03:10:09.511 --> 03:10:11.313]  I wanted to talk about two things.
[03:10:11.313 --> 03:10:14.595]  I would love if you would ask Mr. Madsen about this.
[03:10:14.595 --> 03:10:15.376]  He would be perfect.
[03:10:15.973 --> 03:10:42.609]  To answer this, and that is two events that have occurred in our world's history that I feel are very important to where we are now, which is first, the House of Rothschild in Britain and France convincing the Confederacy to rise up, and then having that loss, and then the House of Rothschild convincing the Germans to go with the Nazis to rise up, and they had the same fate.
[03:10:44.100 --> 03:10:54.843]  Both of these events are critical to our world for the simple reason that when the Confederacy, you know, rised up, we went into a national state of emergency.
[03:10:54.843 --> 03:10:58.283]  We've never left that national state of emergency.
[03:10:58.283 --> 03:10:59.564]  If you read the U.S.
[03:10:59.564 --> 03:11:09.106]  Senate Report 93549, which was done in 1973, it says we are still under national state of emergency.
[03:11:09.106 --> 03:11:10.466]  Yes.
[03:11:10.466 --> 03:11:13.147]  That the quote, and I will quote for them right now,
[03:11:13.686 --> 03:11:19.134]  That the normal function of the federal government has been suspended.
[03:11:19.134 --> 03:11:20.816]  EI the Constitution.
[03:11:20.816 --> 03:11:24.021]  And that's why these executive orders can operate.
[03:11:24.770 --> 03:11:29.774]  Yes, I'm so sick of, quote, freedom people thinking you're free.
[03:11:29.774 --> 03:11:32.656]  You know, get your head out of the sand.
[03:11:32.656 --> 03:11:35.739]  We've been assertive since 1860.
[03:11:35.739 --> 03:11:39.302]  Exactly, and Palin and Obama, it's all a distraction.
[03:11:39.302 --> 03:11:43.465]  The offshore banks illegitimately running our country is the only issue.
[03:11:43.465 --> 03:11:44.686]  Thank you, Step.
[03:11:44.686 --> 03:11:48.850]  And that's why we need to found coffee parties to wake up the tea parties.
[03:11:48.850 --> 03:11:50.091]  What a great idea.
[03:11:50.091 --> 03:11:51.152]  Curtis in Canada.
[03:11:51.991 --> 03:11:53.571]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:11:53.571 --> 03:11:56.872]  Hey, I just wanted to talk about the Internet for a second.
[03:11:56.872 --> 03:12:01.293]  I know this is all in the news now about the Internet getting shut down.
[03:12:01.293 --> 03:12:17.476]  Were you aware of this Department of Defense, it was the DARPA Network Challenge, where they had like ten weather balloons scattered all across the United States, and it took the team from MIT about nine hours to find them all, just using
[03:12:19.540 --> 03:12:23.822]  Just using the internet and social networks and whatnot?
[03:12:23.822 --> 03:12:25.003]  Yes.
[03:12:25.003 --> 03:12:26.503]  Yeah?
[03:12:26.503 --> 03:12:33.847]  Isn't it kind of strange that, like, it's the Department of Defense that's doing this?
[03:12:33.847 --> 03:12:42.071]  I agree that we need to stop this internet, this second internet from coming in, but I mean, if all else fails, like, can't we just start hoarding data and
[03:12:43.086 --> 03:12:52.028]  You know, books, manuals, gardening books, schematics on how to build generators, solar panels... Yes, Curtis, Curtis, Curtis.
[03:12:52.028 --> 03:12:53.729]  Absolutely, I agree with your call.
[03:12:53.729 --> 03:12:54.449]  Let me comment on this.
[03:12:54.449 --> 03:12:58.510]  It's a very important issue.
[03:12:58.510 --> 03:13:02.891]  Right now, with the Internet open and free, we are exponentially growing.
[03:13:02.891 --> 03:13:04.152]  I mean, look at my website.
[03:13:04.152 --> 03:13:06.032]  You look at our radio listeners online.
[03:13:06.032 --> 03:13:08.013]  We're on AM and FM as well.
[03:13:08.013 --> 03:13:09.333]  If you look at every level,
[03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:14.672]  Our numbers are exploding and I'm just one benchmark.
[03:13:14.672 --> 03:13:16.112]  One gauge.
[03:13:16.112 --> 03:13:32.078]  I can be in Montana, California, New York, Florida, Central America, Canada, England, and before it'd be like one out of twenty people that walked past me would stop and say, Alex Jones, I'm a fan.
[03:13:32.078 --> 03:13:36.020]  Now it's like half of them.
[03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:39.201]  And again, that's a gauge of how many people we've woken up.
[03:13:39.201 --> 03:13:40.282]  I'm just Alex Jones.
[03:13:41.127 --> 03:13:48.345]  Sure, we're the biggest thing in the awakening, the biggest thing in the liberty movement worldwide against the globalists, but we're small in the overall aggregate.
[03:13:50.054 --> 03:13:54.058]  And so we want to fight and keep the web free and open.
[03:13:54.058 --> 03:13:55.579]  It isn't a new Internet.
[03:13:55.579 --> 03:13:59.062]  It's a stunted, controlled Internet, as what Internet 2 is.
[03:13:59.062 --> 03:14:01.424]  We've been warning about now for six, seven years.
[03:14:01.424 --> 03:14:03.606]  And now it's all coming true, because we're reading their own manuals.
[03:14:03.606 --> 03:14:06.608]  It's not like I'm predicting this, that they say what they're going to do.
[03:14:06.608 --> 03:14:08.810]  Now they're out in the open, which means they're moving.
[03:14:08.810 --> 03:14:10.432]  They're getting ready for a new war.
[03:14:10.432 --> 03:14:12.353]  That's when they'll launch this Internet control.
[03:14:12.353 --> 03:14:15.356]  They'll launch fake attacks on themselves and shut it down.
[03:14:15.356 --> 03:14:17.498]  So I've always said I have a dual operation.
[03:14:18.763 --> 03:14:21.965]  You know, don't just have one website, have two if you're an average person.
[03:14:21.965 --> 03:14:24.847]  We have like 20 or so, or more.
[03:14:24.847 --> 03:14:36.534]  Don't just... I don't just have a radio show, I make films, I make other videos, I write books, I publish books, I make other... I produce other videos, I support other people, I have other activists on.
[03:14:36.534 --> 03:14:42.238]  I do banner hang contests to show you the power of that and it becomes international sensation.
[03:14:42.238 --> 03:14:43.758]  We're illustrating your power.
[03:14:44.818 --> 03:14:54.366]  And so, you're on the internet, you fight for the internet, but you also, at the grassroots, hoard the info as a backup to give to people.
[03:14:54.366 --> 03:14:59.209]  And the most effective thing is not just some internet, it's to make copies of my films and give them to people.
[03:14:59.209 --> 03:15:00.911]  The power of that is seismic.
[03:15:01.855 --> 03:15:04.936]  I mean, it's just unbelievably big.
[03:15:04.936 --> 03:15:06.676]  And so you attack on all fronts.
[03:15:06.676 --> 03:15:08.676]  They're shutting access TV down around the country.
[03:15:08.676 --> 03:15:10.517]  They've shut down close to half of them.
[03:15:10.517 --> 03:15:11.977]  Use the others that are still there.
[03:15:11.977 --> 03:15:12.757]  Defend them.
[03:15:12.757 --> 03:15:13.377]  Support them.
[03:15:13.377 --> 03:15:14.597]  Go to city council.
[03:15:14.597 --> 03:15:15.597]  Go to county commissioners.
[03:15:15.597 --> 03:15:16.538]  Put my films on.
[03:15:16.538 --> 03:15:18.078]  Do your own show.
[03:15:18.078 --> 03:15:20.178]  Again, it's all a concern.
[03:15:20.178 --> 03:15:21.399]  Call into talk radio.
[03:15:21.399 --> 03:15:23.219]  Letters to the editor.
[03:15:23.219 --> 03:15:26.840]  Call local TV and newspapers and tell them what you'd like to see them report on.
[03:15:26.840 --> 03:15:29.060]  A lot of these reporters aren't bad, they're just ignorant.
[03:15:29.994 --> 03:15:36.118]  There's an awakening happening, and as more people wake up, the more people are speaking out, the harder it is for the globalists to censor.
[03:15:36.118 --> 03:15:49.588]  And if they come in and try to censor the web, as they're doing now, and we scream bloody murder and get the word out, and point out this is happening, it'll blow up in their face, our information will get even more readers and viewers, and it'll be harder for them to try it again.
[03:15:49.588 --> 03:15:50.569]  You fight.
[03:15:50.569 --> 03:15:51.450]  You resist.
[03:15:51.450 --> 03:15:53.311]  Resistance is victory.
[03:15:53.311 --> 03:15:54.792]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[03:15:54.792 --> 03:15:56.833]  Let's talk to Chris in Georgia.
[03:15:56.833 --> 03:15:57.354]  You're on the air.
[03:15:59.051 --> 03:16:04.092]  Hey Alex, happy birthday buddy.
[03:16:04.092 --> 03:16:08.293]  You're right, I really enjoyed your conversation with Wayne Madsen.
[03:16:08.293 --> 03:16:17.275]  When he got into the quadrillions of derivatives, that's something that I think is very underestimated, under-talked about.
[03:16:17.275 --> 03:16:19.116]  That's the globalist power.
[03:16:19.116 --> 03:16:19.996]  That's where they get their power.
[03:16:20.572 --> 03:16:31.064]  Well, it's a power of numbers in that they've got everybody in such Goldman Sachs and some of the other... People will kill for $100 and the globalists just make it out of nothing.
[03:16:31.064 --> 03:16:33.567]  Well, and then, you know, it's out of control.
[03:16:33.567 --> 03:16:40.855]  I think the speed and the processing, everything is coming so fast and so furious that no one can control it with the information age, etc.
[03:16:41.968 --> 03:16:42.929]  It's just getting worse.
[03:16:42.929 --> 03:16:46.015]  I mean, you talk about them taking over our 401ks.
[03:16:46.015 --> 03:16:48.380]  You all mentioned the money market issues.
[03:16:48.380 --> 03:16:53.910]  More than 10 states have remote control thermostats to control your thermostats.
[03:16:54.895 --> 03:16:56.457]  Well, I mean, the money market issues.
[03:16:56.457 --> 03:17:04.264]  I mean, it's the safest investment in the world, and now if I've got $100,000 in the bank and I want to go down and get it out, they can say, no, you can't have your money.
[03:17:04.264 --> 03:17:06.566]  I mean, that's a load of poo right there.
[03:17:06.566 --> 03:17:07.867]  You know, the South Carolina thing.
[03:17:07.867 --> 03:17:11.930]  But the bottom line is, do you have any sort of emergency thing?
[03:17:11.930 --> 03:17:15.353]  You do all this wonderful stuff, and you have 20 websites, whatever.
[03:17:15.353 --> 03:17:19.197]  Is there some dedicated shortwave radio, you know,
[03:17:20.037 --> 03:17:22.964]  That we can all go to when they finally do take it away.
[03:17:22.964 --> 03:17:24.888]  I mean, is there some plan that we have?
[03:17:24.888 --> 03:17:25.630]  Yes, we have a plan!
[03:17:27.479 --> 03:17:29.581]  We have phone backup to WWCR.
[03:17:29.581 --> 03:17:33.424]  They carry four hours during the day live and four hours 9 p.m.
[03:17:33.424 --> 03:17:34.224]  to 1 a.m.
[03:17:34.224 --> 03:17:35.365]  Central.
[03:17:35.365 --> 03:17:36.126]  So 11 a.m.
[03:17:36.126 --> 03:17:36.806]  to 3 p.m.
[03:17:36.806 --> 03:17:39.308]  Central is live on WWCR.
[03:17:39.308 --> 03:17:40.629]  Best shortwave outlet out there.
[03:17:40.629 --> 03:17:42.611]  100,000 smoking watts.
[03:17:42.611 --> 03:17:45.213]  And then they re-air us 9 to 1 a.m.
[03:17:45.213 --> 03:17:47.114]  And so, yes, we will.
[03:17:47.114 --> 03:17:56.221]  If they shut us off the internet, we're going to still... We have phone backups and other backups to our stations, to shortwave, and we're going to try.
[03:17:57.492 --> 03:18:00.996]  Well, if they do shut it down, we need some way to keep it going.
[03:18:00.996 --> 03:18:07.462]  We need some way for at least the dedicated listeners to be able to tune in and keep getting the word out one way or the other.
[03:18:07.462 --> 03:18:08.423]  And that's up to listeners.
[03:18:08.423 --> 03:18:09.905]  We've got those backup systems.
[03:18:09.905 --> 03:18:15.670]  We've got a system where how many people can call free and listen over the phone?
[03:18:16.591 --> 03:18:18.352]  I mean, it's not an iPhone thing.
[03:18:18.352 --> 03:18:20.013]  It's an analog phone line.
[03:18:20.013 --> 03:18:20.834]  How many people can listen?
[03:18:20.834 --> 03:18:21.735]  We have two systems.
[03:18:21.735 --> 03:18:29.159]  One is a volunteer who does it out of Michigan, and the other, we pay for it $2,500 a month.
[03:18:29.159 --> 03:18:32.942]  Colorblue is the sponsor, but it costs $2,500.
[03:18:32.942 --> 03:18:33.923]  Ask one of the IT guys.
[03:18:33.923 --> 03:18:35.784]  I think it's, how many?
[03:18:38.387 --> 03:18:48.032]  Yeah, I think it's... But again, then we'd have to go to a subscription service if we were going to have 100,000 people listening on the phone lines because we couldn't pay for it.
[03:18:48.032 --> 03:18:50.774]  But right now, I know it's thousands every day.
[03:18:50.774 --> 03:18:58.178]  We try to put these different backup systems in.
[03:18:58.178 --> 03:19:01.360]  No, it is not 5,000 people that can listen over the phone system.
[03:19:01.360 --> 03:19:03.601]  You'll have to ask one of the IT guys.
[03:19:03.601 --> 03:19:06.242]  Okay, I hope that answers your question, sirs.
[03:19:06.242 --> 03:19:06.923]  Is that it, Chris?
[03:19:07.792 --> 03:19:10.994]  Yeah, that's pretty much it, but thank you very much and have a great birthday.
[03:19:10.994 --> 03:19:12.355]  Thank you so much.
[03:19:12.355 --> 03:19:16.377]  I want to say it's 500 callers, but I'm going from memory here.
[03:19:16.377 --> 03:19:17.878]  Again, it takes money.
[03:19:17.878 --> 03:19:22.501]  We want to give you 500 free phone lines, $2,500 a month.
[03:19:22.501 --> 03:19:27.884]  And I've done 3-4 days of radio without even plugging sponsors.
[03:19:27.884 --> 03:19:31.747]  And what happens is they get their money refunded because I'm so focused on news
[03:19:32.327 --> 03:19:33.108]  and information.
[03:19:33.108 --> 03:19:43.355]  You want to support us, buy the books, buy the DVDs, buy the material off InfoWars.com, get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, so we can build up our robust system.
[03:19:43.355 --> 03:19:47.758]  If I had the money right now, I'd already start this newspaper nationwide.
[03:19:47.758 --> 03:19:49.219]  And you think, well, newspapers are going out.
[03:19:49.219 --> 03:19:49.980]  No, they're not.
[03:19:49.980 --> 03:19:54.443]  Not newspapers with real news, but it's going to be a free newspaper.
[03:19:54.443 --> 03:19:57.786]  The advertising, though, is what will pay for it.
[03:19:57.786 --> 03:19:59.607]  But it's the startup capital to do that.
[03:19:59.607 --> 03:20:00.428]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.747 --> 03:20:04.369]  Men, are you thinking about the health of your prostate?
[03:20:04.369 --> 03:20:10.075]  Recently, New Vitality Health Products gave away thousands of free bottles of the supplement Beta Prostate.
[03:20:10.075 --> 03:20:16.200]  Due to incredible demand, they're giving away more free bottles of Beta Prostate to any new customers who call now.
[03:20:16.200 --> 03:20:20.084]  Beta Prostate is packed with plant sterols that support your prostate health.
[03:20:20.084 --> 03:20:22.186]  Remember, your prostate affects urine flow,
[03:20:22.446 --> 03:20:22.906]  I think so.
[03:20:43.678 --> 03:20:46.822]  This offer is limited to one free bottle per household.
[03:20:46.822 --> 03:20:49.266]  Give your body nutrition that targets the prostate.
[03:20:49.266 --> 03:20:52.149]  Call now and try Beta Prostate for free.
[03:20:52.149 --> 03:20:52.390]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[03:20:52.390 --> 03:20:52.670]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[03:20:52.670 --> 03:20:52.730]  1-800-360-8306.
[03:21:02.071 --> 03:21:03.092]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:21:03.092 --> 03:21:08.637]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:21:08.637 --> 03:21:09.178]  I get it.
[03:21:09.178 --> 03:21:18.807]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:21:18.807 --> 03:21:20.209]  That's not what's happening.
[03:21:20.209 --> 03:21:24.593]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[03:21:24.793 --> 03:21:26.634]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[03:21:26.634 --> 03:21:28.675]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:21:28.675 --> 03:21:32.057]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:21:32.057 --> 03:21:36.340]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:21:36.340 --> 03:21:37.940]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:21:37.940 --> 03:21:41.342]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:21:41.342 --> 03:21:45.705]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:21:45.705 --> 03:21:46.625]  You should too.
[03:21:46.625 --> 03:21:47.766]  Find out what they know.
[03:21:47.766 --> 03:21:51.008]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:21:51.288 --> 03:21:51.348]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.348 --> 03:21:51.408]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.408 --> 03:21:51.608]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.608 --> 03:21:54.209]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:54.209 --> 03:21:55.930]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:55.930 --> 03:21:57.370]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.176 --> 03:22:15.199]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:15.199 --> 03:22:21.245]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.245 --> 03:22:26.790]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.790 --> 03:22:36.419]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.539 --> 03:22:38.881]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.881 --> 03:22:40.463]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.463 --> 03:22:42.925]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.925 --> 03:22:45.048]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.048 --> 03:22:50.213]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.213 --> 03:22:59.562]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:06.741]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[03:23:06.741 --> 03:23:09.141]  Do you care as much about your air and water?

[03:23:30.885 --> 03:23:40.211]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[03:23:40.211 --> 03:23:47.276]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:23:47.276 --> 03:23:48.137]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:23:48.137 --> 03:23:51.399]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[03:23:51.399 --> 03:23:52.219]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[03:23:52.219 --> 03:23:53.280]  It's time to understand the system.
[03:23:53.280 --> 03:23:53.920]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:23:53.920 --> 03:23:54.201]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:24:00.785 --> 03:24:17.518]  Alright, I'm going to blitz through news coming up after I finish up with some of these calls and play this video slash audio presentation I did on the danger of the Neocon Republican Party takeover of the Tea Parties.
[03:24:17.518 --> 03:24:18.559]  So that's coming up.
[03:24:18.559 --> 03:24:22.782]  Eric in British Columbia, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:24:22.782 --> 03:24:24.444]  Hey, thanks Alex, how you doing?
[03:24:26.768 --> 03:24:29.129]  I live in Whistler, British Columbia.
[03:24:29.129 --> 03:24:32.972]  It's home to some of the events for the Olympics coming up here this week.
[03:24:32.972 --> 03:24:39.716]  Kind of a reference to the article from deprogrammed.net.
[03:24:39.716 --> 03:24:43.679]  We've got two tons of missing ammonium nitrate from Vancouver.
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:49.341]  All this talk about false flag attacks, yadda yadda yadda.
[03:24:49.341 --> 03:24:50.381]  And they say the U.S.
[03:24:50.381 --> 03:24:52.562]  Army will be used in Canada.
[03:24:52.562 --> 03:24:55.243]  That's in the Toronto newspaper.
[03:24:55.243 --> 03:24:56.743]  That they're going to use U.S.
[03:24:56.743 --> 03:24:58.043]  Army in Canada.
[03:24:58.043 --> 03:24:59.544]  So talk about North American Union.
[03:24:59.544 --> 03:25:03.425]  Yes, I think the Olympics are a prime target of the globalist to state's terror.
[03:25:03.425 --> 03:25:08.186]  The problem is citizens and police that are awake are now watching for this.
[03:25:08.186 --> 03:25:12.227]  Just three weeks ago they caught a clear false flag in New Jersey with this army guy
[03:25:12.947 --> 03:25:16.328]  Dressed up like a Muslim running around with rocket launchers.
[03:25:16.328 --> 03:25:17.248]  That's crazy.
[03:25:17.248 --> 03:25:19.989]  And he had like a fake beard and turban.
[03:25:19.989 --> 03:25:23.490]  Yeah, I mean, I just think, again, Whistler, we've got two high-profile kind of targets.
[03:25:23.490 --> 03:25:34.814]  We've got one of the largest stores of ammonium gas cooling our bobsled track, and we also have a massive hydrogen storage facility to run our new green buses.
[03:25:36.107 --> 03:25:40.188]  Well, I'm sure the globalists have already picked their targets, but if we expose them, they won't be able to carry it out.
[03:25:40.188 --> 03:25:44.009]  But I agree, they've really been hype and terror at that event, so we need to be very watchful.
[03:25:44.009 --> 03:25:44.969]  Thank you, Eric.
[03:25:44.969 --> 03:25:46.569]  Jim in Washington, you're on the air.
[03:25:46.569 --> 03:25:50.330]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:51.831]  Just two quick things.
[03:25:51.831 --> 03:26:00.413]  I'm calling about the new horrible bill from South Carolina about identifying subversives or whatever to the government.
[03:26:00.413 --> 03:26:05.574]  I think this is an amazing opportunity that we have to take an attack from these
[03:26:06.525 --> 03:26:17.315]  People turn around and shove it right back up into their guts because if that's the case, if they want to identify subversives, what's calling the lawyers of South Carolina to start doing that?
[03:26:17.315 --> 03:26:18.896]  Let's indict the Federal Reserve.
[03:26:18.896 --> 03:26:30.607]  Let's indict the public servants and businesses that are taking money from places like the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and any other types of organizations like that that have been
[03:26:31.485 --> 03:26:41.432]  You know, you mentioned in your film, let's indict them, bring them in front of a jury, and have them, you know, be identified as subverts to the government of the United States.
[03:26:41.432 --> 03:26:42.573]  You know, that's a great point.
[03:26:42.573 --> 03:26:44.014]  They all violate the Logan Act.
[03:26:44.014 --> 03:26:47.296]  They have secret banker meetings all over the world.
[03:26:47.296 --> 03:26:47.736]  I was just...
[03:26:48.777 --> 03:26:51.479]  Covering that earlier in the show.
[03:26:51.479 --> 03:26:54.301]  They are clearly outside globalist subversives.
[03:26:54.301 --> 03:26:57.984]  How about, they're under the control of foreign powers, how about they register themselves?
[03:26:57.984 --> 03:26:59.305]  I appreciate your call.
[03:26:59.305 --> 03:27:12.455]  The problem with this legislation, they're trying to pass all over the country at the state level, federally proposed though, is, and I'm reading from the actual bill that passed in South Carolina, they got one in Virginia and other states,
[03:27:14.282 --> 03:27:22.810]  It actually says in here that every member of a subversive organization or organized organization subject to foreign control, comma, means a new thought.
[03:27:22.810 --> 03:27:24.772]  People are emailing me going, well it says foreign groups.
[03:27:24.772 --> 03:27:39.025]  Yeah, that and every foreign asset, every person who advocates, comma, teaches, comma, advises or practices the duty, the necessity, or the proprietary, the propriety of controlling
[03:27:40.066 --> 03:27:49.654]  Comma, separate thought, conducting or seizing or overthrowing the government of the United States shall register with the Secretary of State or get 10 years in prison, $25,000 fine.
[03:27:49.654 --> 03:27:57.160]  Now, just like when I wrote the award-winning analysis of Patriot Act 1 and 2, I got the second place for the Project Censored Award.
[03:27:57.160 --> 03:27:59.242]  Lawyers had to go and read it themselves.
[03:27:59.242 --> 03:28:00.183]  I went and read the whole thing.
[03:28:01.440 --> 03:28:08.262]  It said section 802 that all actions that endanger human life in a violation of any federal or state law are acts of terrorism.
[03:28:08.262 --> 03:28:13.064]  And I said this will be used in misdemeanors and non-terror related.
[03:28:13.064 --> 03:28:13.984]  People didn't believe it.
[03:28:13.984 --> 03:28:15.605]  They said, oh, it doesn't mean that.
[03:28:15.605 --> 03:28:18.005]  You don't know how to read law.
[03:28:18.005 --> 03:28:18.566]  I do.
[03:28:18.566 --> 03:28:20.426]  You need to learn how out there.
[03:28:20.426 --> 03:28:22.367]  Anybody can learn this if you work hard.
[03:28:23.402 --> 03:28:34.169]  Now they admit, eight years later, the Patriot Act is used per state, thousands of times per state, every year, in marijuana, drugs, domestic violence, guns.
[03:28:34.169 --> 03:28:37.612]  It's used with teenagers that threaten their teacher.
[03:28:37.612 --> 03:28:39.453]  It's used with people with prank calls.
[03:28:39.453 --> 03:28:42.255]  Everybody knows they're using... In fact, Google it right now.
[03:28:42.255 --> 03:28:44.756]  Patriot Act used for non-terror.
[03:28:44.756 --> 03:28:48.018]  Patriot Act used for regular crime.
[03:28:48.018 --> 03:28:52.902]  And you'll get thousands of AP Reuters telling you how good it is and how great it is.
[03:28:53.582 --> 03:28:55.283]  And people told me I was wrong.
[03:28:55.283 --> 03:28:58.386]  They told me my Homeland Security reports were wrong.
[03:28:58.386 --> 03:29:05.291]  We first started reporting literally the day it broke that the emails on ClimateGate were real.
[03:29:05.291 --> 03:29:07.693]  People didn't believe it for a week.
[03:29:07.693 --> 03:29:09.074]  It's over and over again.
[03:29:09.074 --> 03:29:11.556]  People buy into media hoaxes.
[03:29:11.556 --> 03:29:15.078]  But in the end, the truth comes out.
[03:29:15.078 --> 03:29:15.999]  Okay?
[03:29:15.999 --> 03:29:19.902]  The government puts out its hoaxes, but we tell the truth, and in the end it comes out.
[03:29:20.382 --> 03:29:27.747]  That's why they can run COINTELLOPS on me and make things up I've done and cut videos certain ways to make me look bad.
[03:29:27.747 --> 03:29:29.108]  It's deception, folks.
[03:29:29.108 --> 03:29:30.349]  It's deception.
[03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:33.411]  Because who, when you talk to people, woke the most people up?
[03:29:33.411 --> 03:29:36.933]  80% of the time, my films, my website, my radio show.
[03:29:36.933 --> 03:29:37.794]  We're it.
[03:29:37.794 --> 03:29:39.215]  We're the big kahuna.
[03:29:39.215 --> 03:29:39.935]  You understand that?
[03:29:39.935 --> 03:29:43.517]  We're the frontline flagship against the New World Order.
[03:29:43.517 --> 03:29:46.940]  And they don't want to crush us out in the open because it'll make us martyrs.
[03:29:46.940 --> 03:29:49.101]  So they run all their ops on us, but it's not working.
[03:29:49.101 --> 03:29:49.722]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:49.722 --> 03:29:50.062]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.997 --> 03:29:55.920]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.920 --> 03:29:58.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.059 --> 03:30:05.080]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:05.080 --> 03:30:10.403]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:10.403 --> 03:30:12.444]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:12.444 --> 03:30:17.446]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:17.446 --> 03:30:18.627]  How much do you want?
[03:30:18.627 --> 03:30:19.767]  When do you want it?
[03:30:19.767 --> 03:30:21.648]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:21.648 --> 03:30:22.709]  When will you need it?
[03:30:22.709 --> 03:30:24.910]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:24.910 --> 03:30:26.250]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:26.250 --> 03:30:27.571]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:27.771 --> 03:30:33.037]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:33.037 --> 03:30:36.642]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:36.642 --> 03:30:40.466]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:40.466 --> 03:30:41.687]  How much will you need?
[03:30:41.687 --> 03:30:42.588]  We don't know.
[03:30:42.588 --> 03:30:43.690]  How much do you want?
[03:30:43.690 --> 03:30:44.431]  All you can get.
[03:30:44.431 --> 03:30:45.432]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.692 --> 03:30:48.753]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:48.753 --> 03:30:56.296]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:56.296 --> 03:30:57.497]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:30:57.497 --> 03:31:07.441]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.441 --> 03:31:10.682]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.682 --> 03:31:12.103]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.808 --> 03:31:15.471]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.471 --> 03:31:21.876]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.876 --> 03:31:27.061]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:27.061 --> 03:31:30.344]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:30.344 --> 03:31:37.050]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:37.170 --> 03:31:39.512]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.512 --> 03:31:41.093]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:41.093 --> 03:31:43.554]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.554 --> 03:31:45.676]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.676 --> 03:31:50.839]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.839 --> 03:31:55.842]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:55.842 --> 03:31:59.945]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:02.515 --> 03:32:03.396]  Hi, neighbor.
[03:32:03.396 --> 03:32:09.520]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[03:32:09.520 --> 03:32:16.025]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[03:32:16.025 --> 03:32:19.927]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[03:32:19.927 --> 03:32:23.150]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[03:32:23.810 --> 03:32:27.794]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[03:32:27.794 --> 03:32:33.018]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[03:32:33.018 --> 03:32:35.660]  We will still have two regrets.
[03:32:35.660 --> 03:32:39.683]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[03:32:39.683 --> 03:32:43.346]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[03:32:43.346 --> 03:32:48.751]  Putting off emergency food preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[03:32:49.551 --> 03:32:50.994]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[03:33:11.730 --> 03:33:17.032]  And they know when they take everything you've got, you're going to get angry and stand up against them.
[03:33:17.032 --> 03:33:19.233]  That's what North Common Homeland Security are for.
[03:33:19.233 --> 03:33:21.854]  Let's stand together as the American people.
[03:33:21.854 --> 03:33:23.274]  The phony left, the phony right.
[03:33:23.274 --> 03:33:24.055]  Wake up out of the...
[03:33:25.015 --> 03:33:26.356]  Mirage you're living in.
[03:33:26.356 --> 03:33:27.337]  Break the spell.
[03:33:27.337 --> 03:33:28.839]  Break the trance you're under.
[03:33:28.839 --> 03:33:30.460]  Wake up and stand up.
[03:33:30.460 --> 03:33:36.745]  I want to get more into the cyber security bill and some other key headlines and also finish up with some phone calls.
[03:33:36.745 --> 03:33:40.048]  But there's a key story up at InfoWars.com.
[03:33:40.048 --> 03:33:50.698]  I can't believe the incredible articles Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo, Steve Watson, Paul Watson and all these other great contributors we now have that post every day at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:33:52.503 --> 03:33:54.383]  And the globalists just can't allow this to continue.
[03:33:54.383 --> 03:33:58.264]  That's why they're trying to shut down the web, restrict free speech.
[03:33:58.264 --> 03:34:01.305]  That's why they're coming after me in all sorts of new inventive ways.
[03:34:01.305 --> 03:34:02.565]  It's not working, though.
[03:34:02.565 --> 03:34:03.346]  People see through it.
[03:34:03.346 --> 03:34:04.146]  They understand.
[03:34:04.146 --> 03:34:05.006]  They know our fruits.
[03:34:05.006 --> 03:34:06.586]  They know our long-term mission.
[03:34:06.586 --> 03:34:08.647]  They understand how many people we've woken up.
[03:34:08.647 --> 03:34:12.328]  They have discernment.
[03:34:12.328 --> 03:34:13.008]  This article.
[03:34:13.008 --> 03:34:13.428]  Warning!
[03:34:13.428 --> 03:34:20.110]  Neocon Palin Tea Party takeover will facilitate Obama re-election.
[03:34:20.110 --> 03:34:21.890]  Every mainline Republican
[03:34:23.106 --> 03:34:26.368]  Being fooled by this needs to see this video.
[03:34:26.368 --> 03:34:37.056]  We're about to air for PrisonPlanet.tv members and for all the listeners listening on the radio, the key audio points we make in this video report.
[03:34:37.056 --> 03:34:37.616]  Here it is.
[03:34:37.616 --> 03:34:39.077]  It's nine minutes long.
[03:34:39.077 --> 03:34:39.878]  We'll be back.
[03:34:39.878 --> 03:34:41.899]  Here's the real Sarah Palin.
[03:34:41.899 --> 03:34:45.822]  Don't say you haven't been warned about Sarah Palin.
[03:34:45.822 --> 03:34:47.203]  Don't say you haven't been warned.
[03:34:48.370 --> 03:34:54.794]  You know, I cut my teeth exposing Bill Clinton as a traitor to this country and going after our Second Amendment, our national sovereignty.
[03:34:54.794 --> 03:34:59.318]  And George Bush tripled the size of government, passed the Patriot Act, Homeland Security.
[03:34:59.318 --> 03:35:00.999]  Yes, Obama reissued it.
[03:35:00.999 --> 03:35:04.201]  But the point is, that was bi-partisan.
[03:35:04.201 --> 03:35:06.162]  It gives Obama left cover.
[03:35:06.162 --> 03:35:14.228]  He's expanding wars, biggest defense budgets ever, continuing torture, secret arrest, and the phony right wing comes out and attacks him as a peacenik.
[03:35:15.674 --> 03:35:17.956]  Barack Obama is a corporate whore.
[03:35:17.956 --> 03:35:19.798]  Barack Obama works for the big banks.
[03:35:19.798 --> 03:35:30.167]  Barack Obama is there to bring a form of fake neoliberalism into the United States and worldwide to continue the empire's corruption.
[03:35:30.167 --> 03:35:34.471]  And it's the same thing for Sarah Palin, vetted by Henry Kissinger.
[03:35:34.471 --> 03:35:39.756]  Anybody chosen to be the running mate of John McCain is a nightmare.
[03:35:39.756 --> 03:35:40.857]  If there was any doubt
[03:35:41.778 --> 03:35:53.453]  About the true colors of Sarah Palin, it is now 100% clear that she is a fraud and a warmonger and a neocon that will rape you even worse than George W. Bush did.
[03:35:53.453 --> 03:35:54.014]  It's simple.
[03:35:55.694 --> 03:35:59.597]  9-11 has been used to target the American people instead of a police state.
[03:35:59.597 --> 03:36:00.917]  Do you understand that?
[03:36:00.917 --> 03:36:06.901]  We have the secret MIAC and Homeland Security reports that were leaked to us by law enforcement a year ago.
[03:36:06.901 --> 03:36:11.504]  People couldn't believe their contents for four or five days until the government admitted they were real.
[03:36:12.344 --> 03:36:21.929]  The main focus of homeland security and domestic military operations under NORTHCOM is suppressing the states and the governors and we, the people.
[03:36:21.929 --> 03:36:28.792]  The whole thing is targeted at returning veterans, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, libertarians.
[03:36:28.792 --> 03:36:30.132]  That's in the documents.
[03:36:30.132 --> 03:36:33.754]  All 50 states issued these via the federal government.
[03:36:33.754 --> 03:36:35.015]  But what is Sarah Palin doing?
[03:36:36.013 --> 03:36:38.174]  She's saying we need to expand the Patriot Act.
[03:36:38.174 --> 03:36:41.375]  She says we don't need a constitutional lawyer, we need a president.
[03:36:41.375 --> 03:36:43.956]  Really, America is the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:36:43.956 --> 03:36:45.396]  What's her problem with Obama?
[03:36:45.396 --> 03:36:47.057]  He's continued secret arrest.
[03:36:47.057 --> 03:36:48.437]  He's continued torture.
[03:36:48.437 --> 03:36:49.718]  He's expanded the wars.
[03:36:49.718 --> 03:36:51.979]  He's brought us the two biggest defense budgets in history.
[03:36:52.799 --> 03:36:58.201]  She supported the banker bailout that you supported, Palin, along with Glenn Beck and George W. Bush.
[03:36:58.201 --> 03:36:59.861]  What's the problem with Obama?
[03:36:59.861 --> 03:37:05.863]  The truth is it's a staged WWF wrestling event, and the American people know this.
[03:37:05.863 --> 03:37:19.068]  It was three years ago, at the start of the Republican campaign for the primaries, that true team parties were formed against both political parties for Ron Paul to truly call for our Republic to be restored.
[03:37:20.427 --> 03:37:23.149]  And now look at us three years later.
[03:37:23.149 --> 03:37:44.801]  In 2009, in January, at Tea Parties in Texas, Governor Rick Perry, who supports the North American Union, seizing 8,000 miles of Texas roads, turning them into toll roads, who supports making girls take Gardasil shots when it's not even the law, and was killing a bunch of people, Rick Perry, a Bilderberg Group attendee, calling for world government, that's in the Dallas Morning News,
[03:37:45.521 --> 03:37:49.564]  Rick Perry was being booed everywhere at Tea Parties.
[03:37:49.564 --> 03:37:51.185]  So was Senator Cornyn.
[03:37:51.185 --> 03:37:53.347]  Other neocon Republicans were being booed.
[03:37:53.347 --> 03:37:56.429]  But the Republican Party came in and took over the Tea Parties.
[03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:59.151]  And now they've officially done it with Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck.
[03:37:59.151 --> 03:38:00.692]  It's run by the RNC.
[03:38:00.692 --> 03:38:03.214]  That's who chartered Tea Party Nation.
[03:38:03.214 --> 03:38:05.196]  That's who funds these events.
[03:38:05.196 --> 03:38:10.840]  And then Sarah Palin gets up in front of the Tea Parties and says, we need to have war with Iran right now.
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:13.262]  That's the only thing that'll save Obama's administration.
[03:38:13.542 --> 03:38:16.743]  How hard do you think President Obama will be to defeat in 2012?
[03:38:16.743 --> 03:38:18.984]  It depends on a few things.
[03:38:18.984 --> 03:38:24.347]  Say he played, and I got this from Buchanan reading one of his columns the other day.
[03:38:24.347 --> 03:38:26.067]  Say he played the war card.
[03:38:26.067 --> 03:38:34.771]  Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided to really come out and do whatever he could to support Israel, which I would like him to do.
[03:38:36.076 --> 03:38:37.498]  That changes the dynamics.
[03:38:37.498 --> 03:38:40.282]  You're not suggesting that he would cynically play the war card.
[03:38:40.282 --> 03:38:41.203]  I'm not suggesting that.
[03:38:41.203 --> 03:38:50.775]  I'm saying if he did, things would dramatically change if he decided to toughen up and do all that he can to secure our nation and our allies.
[03:38:51.135 --> 03:38:55.599]  The neocons last week wrote three editorials calling for this to happen.
[03:38:55.599 --> 03:38:57.221]  She supports the Patriot Act.
[03:38:57.221 --> 03:38:59.143]  She supports secret arrests.
[03:38:59.143 --> 03:39:00.664]  She supports torture.
[03:39:00.664 --> 03:39:03.787]  And all of this is designed for the American people.
[03:39:03.787 --> 03:39:05.909]  It's a bait-and-switch, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:39:05.909 --> 03:39:07.211]  We have the internal documents.
[03:39:07.211 --> 03:39:09.313]  And then, in Texas,
[03:39:11.710 --> 03:39:19.096]  On Super Bowl Sunday in Houston, she gets up and endorses Rick Perry, and she says he's going to send a message to Washington.
[03:39:19.096 --> 03:39:22.858]  I can't tell you how proud I am to get to support Governor Rick Perry.
[03:39:22.858 --> 03:39:28.683]  Who better to lead than the successes that we already see here in Texas?
[03:39:28.683 --> 03:39:36.349]  I look forward to Texas sending Washington a message on how things can be done right, because you're doing them right in Texas.
[03:39:37.250 --> 03:39:39.412]  Rick Perry is a total whore of Washington.
[03:39:39.412 --> 03:39:42.415]  He supported the banker bailout, just like Palin and Beck did.
[03:39:42.415 --> 03:39:44.157]  Just like Bush did.
[03:39:44.157 --> 03:39:47.441]  Because as many congressmen have said, the foreign banks run this country.
[03:39:47.441 --> 03:39:52.646]  That's the issue, getting past the puppets of Obama and Palin to the real elite.
[03:39:52.646 --> 03:39:59.573]  Meanwhile, Debra Medina, who says that she will secure our borders, give us open-carry, Vermont-style, true Second Amendment.
[03:40:00.234 --> 03:40:04.216]  She has said that she will get rid of all these illegal, unlawful toll roads.
[03:40:04.216 --> 03:40:06.897]  The state of Texas, the legislature already said they were illegal.
[03:40:06.897 --> 03:40:07.637]  Perry doesn't care.
[03:40:07.637 --> 03:40:08.637]  He's going ahead with it.
[03:40:08.637 --> 03:40:12.919]  Won't even let the legislature see the contract for this Napa superhighway system.
[03:40:12.919 --> 03:40:20.202]  She said she will completely get rid of the unconstitutional property tax that makes you a serf who pays rent on your own supposed home.
[03:40:21.676 --> 03:40:22.556]  Not Rick Perry.
[03:40:22.556 --> 03:40:30.118]  Rick Perry is New World Order and a year ago he started talking like the Tea Parties because he understood that that was the future.
[03:40:30.118 --> 03:40:35.320]  This is the real rebellion against the globalists, against the Copenhagen tax, against the takeover.
[03:40:35.320 --> 03:40:42.282]  But Rick Perry is saying nothing about Austin announcing $2.6 billion in taxes in the next three years of carbon taxes.
[03:40:44.847 --> 03:40:55.473]  So she's calling for war with Iran and saying that Obama can get his approval ratings up by launching an attack on Iran that could start World War III.
[03:40:55.473 --> 03:40:57.834]  That's a direct neocon talking point.
[03:40:57.834 --> 03:40:59.375]  She was vetted by Kissinger.
[03:40:59.375 --> 03:41:03.217]  She was chosen by John McCain as her running mate.
[03:41:03.217 --> 03:41:07.140]  The anti-gun, attacker of free speech with McCain, Feingold.
[03:41:07.140 --> 03:41:08.620]  The guy that supported the bailout.
[03:41:08.620 --> 03:41:09.561]  What else do you need to know?
[03:41:10.081 --> 03:41:24.608]  And she gets up and pushes the mainline Republican garbage that's killing the Republican Party and a bunch of lapdogs with her phony trite that this tart puts out start buying into it.
[03:41:24.608 --> 03:41:29.951]  You're just like idiot Obama supporters who really thought he was going to end the war and end torture.
[03:41:30.171 --> 03:41:33.254]  And in the banker bailouts when he's completely run by it.
[03:41:33.254 --> 03:41:34.134]  Wake up!
[03:41:34.134 --> 03:41:35.495]  Stop being conned!
[03:41:35.495 --> 03:41:37.397]  We don't have time to screw around.
[03:41:37.397 --> 03:41:39.699]  We don't have time to be bamboozled again.
[03:41:39.699 --> 03:41:41.280]  We don't have time to be idiots.
[03:41:41.280 --> 03:41:42.921]  But here's the good news.
[03:41:42.921 --> 03:41:47.525]  It took people six years to wake up to the fact in the polls that Bush was a fraud.
[03:41:47.525 --> 03:41:50.067]  It took people less than a year with Obama.
[03:41:50.067 --> 03:41:53.630]  And so they can go ahead and stick Miss World War III Sarah Palin in.
[03:41:53.630 --> 03:41:55.231]  It'll take a few months to wake up to her.
[03:41:56.112 --> 03:41:58.213]  This bait-and-switch isn't working anymore.
[03:41:58.213 --> 03:42:01.514]  The American people are becoming constitutionalist populist.
[03:42:01.514 --> 03:42:09.576]  They're discovering who the real enemy is, the global New World Order that tried in Copenhagen a few months ago to set up a world tax paid to private banks.
[03:42:09.576 --> 03:42:11.117]  We need to indict Geithner.
[03:42:11.117 --> 03:42:12.417]  We need to arrest the bankers.
[03:42:12.417 --> 03:42:15.979]  It's really over 25 trillion they've stolen.
[03:42:15.979 --> 03:42:19.880]  We need to go after the New World Order and identify the real enemy of our sovereignty.
[03:42:20.942 --> 03:42:24.804]  Mark my words, Sarah Palin is total New World Order garbage.
[03:42:24.804 --> 03:42:32.347]  If she would have endorsed Debra Medina, who's surging in the polls, we could start a real peaceful revolution at the state level.
[03:42:32.347 --> 03:42:41.971]  But instead, like the cavalry, as his polls drop and Debra Medina's polls go up, she came into Texas to tell the people, oh, rebel against tyranny.
[03:42:41.971 --> 03:42:43.551]  Support Glenn Beck.
[03:42:43.551 --> 03:42:45.432]  Support Governor Perry.
[03:42:45.432 --> 03:42:48.954]  I don't know if any of you caught recently, just a couple of days ago, the Glenn Beck Show.
[03:42:48.954 --> 03:42:49.714]  Holy moly!
[03:42:54.342 --> 03:43:02.725]  The segment was on the different states and how everybody's doing and according to Glenn Beck and all these researchers, jeez, you guys are just walking on water.
[03:43:02.725 --> 03:43:05.926]  The way things are going in Texas.
[03:43:05.926 --> 03:43:15.749]  You gotta catch his episode on that because he recognized, so many people are recognizing that Texas is open for business and companies and people, they're moving here.
[03:43:15.749 --> 03:43:18.770]  They keep moving here because they know that Governor Perry gets it.
[03:43:19.130 --> 03:43:20.892]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:20.892 --> 03:43:25.517]  It's the neocons that are running the Obama administration.
[03:43:25.517 --> 03:43:28.781]  They're the neocons who run Fox News.
[03:43:28.781 --> 03:43:32.185]  We've got the Fox Nation, we've got the Tea Party Nation.
[03:43:32.185 --> 03:43:37.632]  They're trying to take control of the real opposition to the New World Order and control it and destroy it.
[03:43:39.011 --> 03:43:49.115]  If you want smaller government, if you want to return to liberty and freedom, you better realize we're being looted by offshore corporations and not be suckered by Miss Alaska, Sarah Palin.
[03:43:49.115 --> 03:43:53.977]  This woman is openly calling for a declaration of war against Iran.
[03:43:53.977 --> 03:43:57.599]  This woman is a fraud and a danger to humanity.
[03:43:57.599 --> 03:43:58.860]  Here's the most important point.
[03:43:58.860 --> 03:44:01.281]  I don't want Barack Obama in office in three years.
[03:44:01.281 --> 03:44:06.123]  I'd like to elect a true constitutionalist like Ron Paul or somebody else.
[03:44:07.003 --> 03:44:16.752]  But she's being positioned so that she can be destroyed and so she can be torn down so Barack Obama will be your next president again in 2012.
[03:44:16.752 --> 03:44:18.393]  You mark my words.
[03:44:18.393 --> 03:44:20.475]  Wake up and stop being suckered.
[03:44:20.475 --> 03:44:27.161]  This video needs to go viral to all the idiot neocons and all the idiot Obama supporters so this fraud can be exposed.
[03:44:27.161 --> 03:44:29.503]  I'm Alex Jones from InfoWars.com.
[03:44:31.863 --> 03:44:37.750]  And again, you can go to InfoWars.com and get the warning neoconpalent article by Aaron Dykes.
[03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:45.318]  It has the video posted, plus all the links you see in the video, to video and news articles and documents.
[03:44:45.318 --> 03:44:48.582]  Remember, when Ron Paul could have won the Republican nomination,
[03:44:49.813 --> 03:44:49.873]  I'm
[03:45:07.899 --> 03:45:09.520]  Huge amount of giving.
[03:45:09.520 --> 03:45:10.800]  This is what they're doing.
[03:45:10.800 --> 03:45:14.482]  They know what they're doing.
[03:45:14.482 --> 03:45:17.283]  And Sarah Palin saying she wants all these wars.
[03:45:17.283 --> 03:45:20.825]  Sarah Palin saying she wants to declare war on Iran.
[03:45:20.825 --> 03:45:23.466]  Telling Obama, play that card to get re-elected.
[03:45:23.466 --> 03:45:27.988]  That's her job and she knows exactly what she's doing.
[03:45:27.988 --> 03:45:32.210]  Hey, if you want to be scammed, you want to be conned, go ahead and be suckered again.
[03:45:32.210 --> 03:45:33.971]  We need to go after the real government.
[03:45:34.873 --> 03:45:41.679]  Above Obama, above Sarah Palin, above John McCain, above all these people to the offshore banks.
[03:45:41.679 --> 03:45:46.563]  Now, shifting gears again, I want to show you the Drudge Report right now.
[03:45:46.563 --> 03:45:58.753]  Up on the Drudge Report, they moved it right up to the top, red link to our article about the naked body scanners being used
[03:46:00.083 --> 03:46:09.774]  To record people's bodies, and when movie stars and TV stars go through, they record it, print off their naked body, and go over to them and ask them to sign it.
[03:46:09.774 --> 03:46:14.959]  Click on that link for people live on TV, right now, and radio.
[03:46:14.959 --> 03:46:19.925]  You click on that link, it goes to PrisonPlanet.com, expose naked body scammer.
[03:46:21.189 --> 03:46:22.030]  Keep saying scammer.
[03:46:22.030 --> 03:46:22.850]  It's a Freudian slip.
[03:46:22.850 --> 03:46:23.511]  It is a scam.
[03:46:23.511 --> 03:46:30.936]  They exposed naked body scanner images of Filmstar printed, circulated by airport staff.
[03:46:30.936 --> 03:46:33.537]  And we have the video of this TV star talking about it.
[03:46:33.537 --> 03:46:35.198]  We've already confirmed this is going on.
[03:46:35.198 --> 03:46:37.880]  Of course they're recording it on a hard drive with your name.
[03:46:37.880 --> 03:46:39.881]  You can see them typing into the database.
[03:46:39.881 --> 03:46:41.663]  Government documents admit this.
[03:46:41.663 --> 03:46:46.106]  We can kill these naked body scanners now by exposing this.
[03:46:46.106 --> 03:46:50.989]  We can kill, just like we destroyed and defeated the carbon tax takeover in the Senate.
[03:46:54.170 --> 03:46:56.370]  By exposing what a fraud these are.
[03:46:56.370 --> 03:46:57.511]  I had a guest on yesterday.
[03:46:57.511 --> 03:46:59.531]  He's a constitutional lawyer in Denver.
[03:46:59.531 --> 03:47:02.652]  Tried to go in the courthouse in the county that Denver's located in.
[03:47:02.652 --> 03:47:04.153]  They wanted a naked body scan him.
[03:47:04.153 --> 03:47:04.773]  He said no.
[03:47:04.773 --> 03:47:07.414]  Then they would search him, grab his genitals.
[03:47:07.414 --> 03:47:09.054]  He pointed out that it was illegal.
[03:47:09.054 --> 03:47:11.715]  They were scanning little kids, which is a child porn violation.
[03:47:12.535 --> 03:47:18.201]  They now aren't scanning people below the age of 18, and they're just doing wines of other people.
[03:47:18.201 --> 03:47:19.182]  This is illegal.
[03:47:19.182 --> 03:47:30.613]  They're trying to set a precedent with all of this, and we've got to say no, and everybody has got to get the article that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and that's on the front page of Drudge, LinkedIn Red.
[03:47:32.441 --> 03:47:38.825]  Naked body scanner images of Filmstar printed, circulated by airport staff.
[03:47:38.825 --> 03:47:42.407]  If that isn't sensational tyranny, I don't know what is.
[03:47:42.407 --> 03:47:44.088]  And you get this out to people.
[03:47:44.088 --> 03:47:49.171]  This is another death nail so people know the truth that they're being recorded.
[03:47:49.171 --> 03:47:50.432]  Let's go to Joe in Texas.
[03:47:50.432 --> 03:47:51.192]  Joe, you're on the air.
[03:47:51.192 --> 03:47:51.793]  Thanks for holding.
[03:47:52.455 --> 03:47:54.556]  Hey, thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[03:47:54.556 --> 03:47:54.996]  Welcome!
[03:47:54.996 --> 03:47:57.157]  I hope you have a happy birthday.
[03:47:57.157 --> 03:47:59.439]  Uh, Alex, I'm calling about an article I just got.
[03:47:59.439 --> 03:48:00.899]  I don't know how you document everything.
[03:48:00.899 --> 03:48:04.301]  Uh, it's in the Medina Electric Cooperative.
[03:48:04.301 --> 03:48:09.384]  It regards the census, and it says take the census precautions.
[03:48:09.384 --> 03:48:16.347]  Uh, they've got 140 states, more than 140,000 census workers are charged with counting every person in the United States.
[03:48:16.347 --> 03:48:19.729]  Uh, it says that they're going to start the first step in March.
[03:48:20.345 --> 03:48:23.411]  That, uh, then it skips down here and says...
[03:48:24.173 --> 03:48:25.353]  If it is a U.S.
[03:48:25.353 --> 03:48:41.356]  Census worker knocking on your door, he or she will be wearing a badge and carrying a Census Bureau canvas bag, a confidentiality notice, and a computer equipped with GPS software to reduce the number of geographic coding errors created by using maps.
[03:48:41.356 --> 03:48:42.136]  Yeah, let me be clear.
[03:48:42.136 --> 03:48:45.957]  They've already in the last year gotten everybody's front door GPSed.
[03:48:45.957 --> 03:48:51.798]  Under the Fifth Amendment, you don't have to answer any questions, but how many people live in the house and they have about
[03:48:52.478 --> 03:48:55.339]  Five or more, five we know of, different versions.
[03:48:55.339 --> 03:48:59.680]  One has 10 questions, one has 40, one has 100, one has more than that.
[03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:03.001]  Up to over 200 questions with some of these community surveys.
[03:49:03.001 --> 03:49:04.061]  What do you have in the bank?
[03:49:04.061 --> 03:49:05.221]  Do you own firearms?
[03:49:05.221 --> 03:49:06.882]  What type of toilet do you have?
[03:49:06.882 --> 03:49:12.563]  These are actual questions and they show up with these fake badges and threaten you.
[03:49:12.563 --> 03:49:19.385]  If you were a murderer caught with 50 bodies in your basement, you're not compelled to incriminate yourself.
[03:49:19.385 --> 03:49:20.345]  It's the Fifth Amendment.
[03:49:20.965 --> 03:49:25.229]  And they want to have monthly, first yearly, then monthly census.
[03:49:25.229 --> 03:49:28.792]  They want the census to be the new secret police spies.
[03:49:28.792 --> 03:49:38.661]  And they're running all these, you know, $100 million, one of them was a $145 million ad package I saw last week, just to brainwash about the census.
[03:49:38.661 --> 03:49:43.385]  And, you know, they came to my door in 2000 and said, all you said was two people live here.
[03:49:43.385 --> 03:49:45.387]  And I said, yeah, it's me and my girlfriend, now my wife.
[03:49:46.147 --> 03:49:48.187]  You took the words right out of what they're saying here too, Alex.
[03:50:12.216 --> 03:50:14.518]  Yeah, basic.
[03:50:14.518 --> 03:50:17.761]  It's not basic.
[03:50:17.761 --> 03:50:20.723]  They ask salary, bank accounts, stocks, bonds.
[03:50:20.723 --> 03:50:22.825]  None of your business!
[03:50:22.825 --> 03:50:29.871]  A cop can't show up at your door and ask you that, but cops are showing up and doing knock and talk where they ask about your firearms.
[03:50:29.871 --> 03:50:31.293]  They have no right!
[03:50:31.293 --> 03:50:35.877]  They're setting the precedent that government agents, secret police get to ask you questions.
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:38.201]  Send me the article, okay?
[03:50:38.201 --> 03:50:40.161]  Send it to ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com.
[03:50:40.161 --> 03:50:41.862]  What's the headline again?
[03:50:41.862 --> 03:50:46.624]  Uh, yes sir, it's called, uh, uh, Take Census Precautions.
[03:50:46.624 --> 03:50:59.370]  And then the amazing thing, what they're doing to Austin is right beside it, Alex, and now we'll send you the article, right beside it, they have where the federal government's allocating all of this grant money for electric power.
[03:50:59.370 --> 03:51:00.451]  I know, it's incredible.
[03:51:00.451 --> 03:51:01.011]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.833 --> 03:51:09.538]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:51:09.538 --> 03:51:15.943]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:51:15.943 --> 03:51:22.268]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:51:22.268 --> 03:51:27.172]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:51:27.632 --> 03:51:35.817]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:51:35.817 --> 03:51:40.420]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[03:51:40.420 --> 03:51:44.122]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:51:45.083 --> 03:51:50.826]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[03:52:03.333 --> 03:52:07.355]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.355 --> 03:52:10.597]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.597 --> 03:52:12.018]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.722 --> 03:52:15.383]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.383 --> 03:52:21.764]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.764 --> 03:52:26.966]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.966 --> 03:52:36.948]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:37.068 --> 03:52:39.409]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.409 --> 03:52:41.010]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:41.010 --> 03:52:43.471]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.471 --> 03:52:45.592]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.592 --> 03:52:50.734]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.734 --> 03:52:59.858]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.441 --> 03:53:06.724]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[03:53:06.724 --> 03:53:09.985]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:53:09.985 --> 03:53:17.790]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[03:53:18.050 --> 03:53:20.291]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[03:53:20.291 --> 03:53:22.672]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[03:53:22.672 --> 03:53:29.475]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[03:53:29.475 --> 03:53:35.198]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[03:53:35.658 --> 03:53:38.239]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[03:53:38.239 --> 03:53:46.003]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[03:53:53.746 --> 03:53:53.806]  1-888-213-4338.
[03:54:02.083 --> 03:54:04.846]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:54:04.846 --> 03:54:07.630]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:16.152 --> 03:54:23.354]  I saw similar polls in Texas, but these are public policy polls, one of the big nationals.
[03:54:23.354 --> 03:54:27.275]  Perry's at 39, Hutchinson 28, Debra Medina 24.
[03:54:27.275 --> 03:54:30.576]  She's getting about 5 points a week.
[03:54:30.576 --> 03:54:35.498]  Some weeks she gets 6, some weeks she gets 3, but it's trending up.
[03:54:35.498 --> 03:54:36.398]  We've got a month.
[03:54:38.220 --> 03:54:40.822]  Coming up in about, what, 10 days?
[03:54:40.822 --> 03:54:45.887]  Yeah, 10 days, early voting starts, and we've got about a week or so after that into the elections.
[03:54:45.887 --> 03:54:48.329]  We've got less than a month.
[03:54:48.329 --> 03:54:53.754]  Trending, she'll be past Hutchinson, but they'll try to make up some scandals soon against Medina.
[03:54:53.754 --> 03:54:55.496]  They're afraid to give her too much attention.
[03:54:55.496 --> 03:54:59.580]  She'll pass Hutchinson by early voting and may be able to beat Perry.
[03:55:00.970 --> 03:55:03.472]  How exciting is that information?
[03:55:03.472 --> 03:55:08.336]  But Sarah Palin's down here to prop up Perry, as I just talked about.
[03:55:08.336 --> 03:55:11.539]  I meant to get more into the cybersecurity bill today.
[03:55:11.539 --> 03:55:13.401]  I covered most of the news.
[03:55:13.401 --> 03:55:13.921]  Here it is.
[03:55:13.921 --> 03:55:14.341]  Poll.
[03:55:14.341 --> 03:55:16.764]  Medina closing on Hutchinson.
[03:55:16.764 --> 03:55:19.085]  Again, that's Politico.
[03:55:19.085 --> 03:55:20.847]  And again, this isn't just about Texas.
[03:55:20.847 --> 03:55:22.729]  It's about the entire country.
[03:55:22.729 --> 03:55:24.030]  This message it sends.
[03:55:24.030 --> 03:55:26.372]  Hey, her already getting these many points is already a victory.
[03:55:27.438 --> 03:55:35.701]  Keep fighting, but regardless if she wins, loses, draws, whatever, the electronic voting machines will probably come into this for the globalists, but that's their ace in the hole.
[03:55:35.701 --> 03:55:41.543]  But this message to all the other states and all these other candidates, we don't want your Rick Perry, Sarah Palin people.
[03:55:41.543 --> 03:55:44.084]  We want real constitutionalists.
[03:55:44.084 --> 03:55:46.845]  I cannot describe to you how amazing this is.
[03:55:49.517 --> 03:55:52.038]  Oh man, I tell you, what an amazing broadcast today.
[03:55:52.038 --> 03:55:54.139]  I want to try to jam in a call or two here at the end.
[03:55:54.139 --> 03:56:00.162]  I just want to remind listeners at the close of the show, if you believe in what we've done here together in 14 years,
[03:56:01.752 --> 03:56:06.215]  You need to know now is the time to talk to your neighbors, to knock on doors, to warn people, to have viewing parties.
[03:56:06.215 --> 03:56:08.577]  Now is the time to show people, follow the Republic.
[03:56:08.577 --> 03:56:12.399]  Because the Republic is falling into history and into tyranny if we don't wake them up.
[03:56:12.399 --> 03:56:19.084]  Somebody watches this two-hour, 24-minute film, they've got an overview of the entire program, the entire system and how to stop them.
[03:56:19.084 --> 03:56:23.747]  Somebody sees the Obama deception, a fake right-winger will watch it thinking it's going to bash Obama.
[03:56:23.747 --> 03:56:26.369]  It wakes them up that both parties are controlled.
[03:56:26.369 --> 03:56:28.130]  Terror storm, endgame.
[03:56:28.130 --> 03:56:29.111]  Give you the bigger agenda.

[03:56:40.993 --> 03:56:48.115]  If you don't stand up, if you don't financially support, if you don't get out there and wake people up to support Medina and others, we know we're going to lose.
