[00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:04.751]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:06.472]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:08.333]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.953 --> 00:00:09.774]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.534 --> 00:00:11.435]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:15.697]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:20.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.999]  We're live, eight minutes into the second hour.
[00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:27.220]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday, May 3rd, 2010 edition.
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:38.083]  We've seen the Communist International Workers' Day, riots, buildings being torched, people being racially attacked all over the United States, and an almost complete mainstream media blackout.
[00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:40.263]  It is in the AP, Associated Press.
[00:00:40.663 --> 00:00:43.624]  It is in some local newspapers in California, Arizona.
[00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:47.999]  And other states, but it is not a big national news story.
[00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:49.820]  We need to force this out into the open.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:00.545]  Can you imagine if Tea Partiers in Santa Cruz would have gone out and set fire to buildings, racially attack people, and knocked out the windows of 18 plus businesses.
[00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:03.426]  They were saying 18, now they're saying 20 plus businesses.
[00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.367]  And the media is doing everything they can to spin this.
[00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:09.429]  We have a key article up on PrisonPlanet.com that's been
[00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.472]  We had videos added of other racial attacks and just incredible things that are being said and done.
[00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.714]  Pro-illegal immigration thugs terrorize Santa Cruz.
[00:01:19.094 --> 00:01:20.455]  Corporate media shrugs.
[00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:25.718]  Now I want to put a photo up on screen from just one video that we were randomly watching.
[00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:29.300]  This one's out of Phoenix with a sign.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.961]  And shortly after this they attack police.
[00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:36.004]  And this photo says, give us free housing.
[00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:42.958]  He says, give us free health care, jobs, no taxes, house, food.
[00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.419]  Wow!
[00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.660]  You're not going to work?
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.800]  You're not going to pay taxes?
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.822]  He says, give us free health care, jobs, no taxes, house, food.
[00:01:53.302 --> 00:01:54.923]  You owe us America.
[00:01:55.463 --> 00:01:59.905]  We will shoot more police in Arizona until we get free.
[00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:16.738]  and they're having cops all the time being killed in arizona that's why they've every week or two illegals kill another cop and they burned down houses all over arizona one night uh... a few years ago fourteen homes were burned in one night cattle are being shot i mean it is just
[00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:18.848]  Total implosion.
[00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:20.310]  Mexico has collapsed.
[00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:22.652]  There is hardly anywhere that isn't safe.
[00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:25.335]  Twenty-plus thousand deaths the last two years alone.
[00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:27.197]  Spilling across the border.
[00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.962]  And illegal aliens just running around waving signs.
[00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:36.988]  Countless clips where the illegal aliens are saying that
[00:02:38.188 --> 00:02:39.770]  They want basically everything free.
[00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:51.405]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of the woman again right before they attack police at that rally in Arizona saying we will use our axes, our pickaxes, to kill you.
[00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:52.066]  Here it is.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.984]  We will take off our shovels and our pickaxes and we break the land and make it landscaping and clean your toilets and our toilets.
[00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:06.045]  We will use them against you!
[00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:07.786]  Believe that!
[00:03:09.707 --> 00:03:12.168]  Oh ma'am, I mean we do believe you.
[00:03:12.188 --> 00:03:18.491]  I mean I've got Albuquerque banks hit with brazen vandals.
[00:03:19.592 --> 00:03:22.693]  Where is my... I can't even keep track of this anymore.
[00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:23.214]  Where is my
[00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:31.588]  Where is my stack about the illegal aliens attacking Santa Cruz and San Francisco?
[00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:35.929]  I mean, I can't even keep track of it here.
[00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.210]  Meanwhile, if you send human rights observers down to Mexico, you get machine-gunned.
[00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.411]  Here's the Washington Post.
[00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:47.872]  Here's ABC News.
[00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:53.733]  What I'll do is I'm going to go to your calls and I'm going to dig around in my stack and see
[00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.330]  He's bringing me so many articles in so fast here.
[00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:05.094]  I'm going to find those three articles I had from the AP and others about the torches and the burning buildings.
[00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:06.535]  You know what?
[00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:07.996]  I ammed you three of those this morning.
[00:04:08.036 --> 00:04:08.796]  Just reprint them again.
[00:04:09.397 --> 00:04:10.477]  I've got to clean the desk off.
[00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:19.943]  This is only three days of broadcast here and it's become a complete mess because of, well, the fact that I don't file this stuff.
[00:04:19.963 --> 00:04:21.324]  There's just too much to even keep track of.
[00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:24.427]  I'll get into this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:26.448]  I'll just get into it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:04:26.908 --> 00:04:28.329]  Let's talk to John in Minnesota.
[00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:29.169]  You're on the air, John.
[00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:31.910]  Yes, Alex.
[00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:36.873]  Do you believe Goldman Sachs is a reincarnation of Don Pacifico?
[00:04:39.214 --> 00:04:41.135]  We'll tell folks who Don Pacifico is.
[00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:51.240]  Well, Don Pacifico was a Portuguese Jewish guy who had lived in Gibraltar and acquired English or British citizenship.
[00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:56.600]  And, uh, he had moved to, uh, Athens, Greece, and he set up a good shy-locking operation.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.183]  And, uh, anyways, the Greeks got very mad, and they burned down his house, and they took his money, etc.
[00:05:03.483 --> 00:05:09.526]  And this guy, he's suing the Greek government, as an individual now, for millions of pounds sterling.
[00:05:09.986 --> 00:05:11.567]  So who, who intervenes?
[00:05:12.027 --> 00:05:13.008]  Oh, not the Krauts.
[00:05:13.368 --> 00:05:14.548]  It's Lord Palmerston.
[00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:16.089]  It's the House of Lords.
[00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.191]  They happened to send 14 ships on, uh, January 18th,
[00:05:22.295 --> 00:05:25.637]  1850 to blockade until Greece paid up.
[00:05:26.237 --> 00:05:28.078]  I was not aware of that story.
[00:05:28.718 --> 00:05:34.760]  The name rung a slight bell in the back of my mind, but you'll have to send me an email about that.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.841]  I appreciate your call.
[00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.462]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ross in Texas.
[00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:40.783]  Ross, you're on the air.
[00:05:41.643 --> 00:05:41.883]  Alex?
[00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:42.544]  Yes, sir.
[00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:45.465]  Sir, it's an honor to speak with you.
[00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:46.465]  You're one of my heroes.
[00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:50.787]  Just like a voice in the wilderness crying out to the world,
[00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:56.313]  You know, when you think of heroes, you think of people like, what, Bush landing on an aircraft carrier or a chain or something like that.
[00:05:56.373 --> 00:06:00.495]  No, sir, we need people who speak the truth and you are, you're my hero.
[00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:05.577]  And my call is because I want to address the illegal alien situation.
[00:06:05.597 --> 00:06:10.659]  I believe people, we have to understand that these are all people.
[00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.979]  We're all part of God's creation.
[00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.620]  They're people.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.901]  They're here because there's a reason for it.
[00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:19.262]  And if we allow the people who are in power
[00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:25.216]  to manipulate us by fighting with each other then they don't have to fight, they don't have to fire a shot.
[00:06:25.716 --> 00:06:32.262]  Second, when we talk about the money that's been given to the bankers, they won't tell us where it's been distributed to.
[00:06:33.023 --> 00:06:34.324]  It's been given to the mercenaries.
[00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:40.169]  They're already in play, they're already been paid, and they're going to get more money when they start pulling the triggers.
[00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.575]  Third, really, really, people, we really need to be able to have our own water supply.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.261]  We have to reclaim our water supplies now.
[00:06:49.641 --> 00:07:00.126]  The same fluoride injection systems will be used to... Alex, do you remember several years ago in London, when all those people got sick from the Neurovirus?
[00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:05.089]  In two weeks time, 2.2 million people, I believe, were sickened.
[00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:06.469]  Think about that.
[00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:07.850]  That was a beta test.
[00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.493]  Anyway, in closing, sir, I just think that... I think the world of you, and I just thank Jesus that
[00:07:14.983 --> 00:07:18.225]  He's given us a voice to hear what's really going on.
[00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:18.905]  Thank you, sir.
[00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:21.566]  Well, Ross in Texas, I appreciate your call.
[00:07:22.587 --> 00:07:23.908]  We have to be specific, though.
[00:07:24.028 --> 00:07:30.851]  Notice how the media is demonizing Tea Parties, conservatives, libertarians, anybody who is against the banking takeover.
[00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:37.615]  And by saying that the Tea Parties were Republican in the last year and a half, the media created a self-fulfilling
[00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:40.032]  Prophecy.
[00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:56.850]  That's what they were able to do because then Republicans, mainline Republicans did go out and did join the Tea Parties and basically started taking it over because they were told by the media this is a Republican event when it should have been a not bipartisan but just populist movement.
[00:07:57.927 --> 00:07:58.267]  Okay.
[00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:07.233]  And so now they're trying to limit criticism of the banking takeover to something that Republicans are doing, when it's only common sense.
[00:08:07.773 --> 00:08:09.394]  This is something that affects everybody.
[00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:17.959]  And on the subject of illegal aliens, most illegal aliens are just hard-working people wanting to send money home to their family.
[00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:24.343]  But because of the media and the public schools in Mexico and the U.S., the liberation theology they've been taught
[00:08:25.307 --> 00:08:39.235]  Is that the Southwest belongs to Mexico, Mexico is poor, not because they've always been under colonial tyranny, but because the United States is bad, and that this is their nation, and that they have a right to everything for free.
[00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:54.743]  And so a large percentage, I wouldn't say the majority, but a large minority of the illegal aliens are hardcore, just extremely hardcore radicals that can't stand this country.
[00:08:56.853 --> 00:09:04.825]  And they've been radicalized, and when they carry out radical attacks like burning buildings and racially attacking people, the media sweeps it under the rug.
[00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:12.983]  People think that the Republican Party is going to save them and stop all of this.
[00:09:13.384 --> 00:09:25.969]  It was in the Dallas Morning News in 2007 that Rob Allen & Co., this giant PR firm that Bush used when he was governor and then president, actually financed and funded the first illegal alien rallies around the country for
[00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:27.529]  Amnesty.
[00:09:28.029 --> 00:09:28.850]  But it backfired.
[00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.951]  The illegals refused the American flags that Rob Allen and Co.
[00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:36.431]  and others were giving them out of the backs of trucks and waved their Mexican flags.
[00:09:37.152 --> 00:09:40.172]  And so it backfired and blew up in their face.
[00:09:40.893 --> 00:09:49.495]  And so now you have all of these business owners in Santa Cruz and other places, and we'll fast forward on this tape and show you some of that, where
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:59.542]  You know, people are running around attacking structures, setting fires, and then the media just basically engages in a national cover-up of this.
[00:09:59.982 --> 00:10:01.662]  This should be national news.
[00:10:02.403 --> 00:10:04.683]  Let's go to another caller here.
[00:10:04.743 --> 00:10:06.103]  Let's talk to Paul in Tennessee.
[00:10:06.144 --> 00:10:06.884]  Paul, you're on the air.
[00:10:08.964 --> 00:10:09.784]  Am I on there, Alex?
[00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:10.324]  Yes, you are.
[00:10:10.344 --> 00:10:11.165]  All right, sir.
[00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:14.706]  I just wanted to say, you are the 21st century Thomas Jefferson.
[00:10:14.726 --> 00:10:16.666]  There's nobody else doing what you're doing right now.
[00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:18.186]  I do appreciate you.
[00:10:18.206 --> 00:10:20.127]  I'm the illegal alien.
[00:10:21.775 --> 00:10:22.596]  Situation here.
[00:10:22.836 --> 00:10:24.197]  I just wanted to read it briefly.
[00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:27.740]  I'll bridge it a little bit out of the Daily Times in Blount County, Tennessee.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.341]  This happened on March 27th.
[00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:31.883]  Officer seized cash, released two men.
[00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:40.130]  Monroe County authorities released two Mexican men without charges after seizing $105,000 in cash and several other items from their vehicle.
[00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:47.817]  The occupants, both Mexican nationals, explained they were on their way back to Mexico from a visit to New York City, where they had stayed for three days.
[00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:58.829]  Queen said he seized a total of $104,990 in cash, along with a laptop, computer, Nikon camera, three cell phones, a GPS, and his own recording device.
[00:10:59.469 --> 00:11:01.391]  He said he allowed the two to drive away without charges.
[00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:04.733]  He did give them a property receipt for the evidence seized.
[00:11:05.434 --> 00:11:09.457]  And I just wanted to think what do you think of that?
[00:11:10.478 --> 00:11:11.738]  Give me that headline again.
[00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:14.681]  Officer seized cash, released two men.
[00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:16.262]  Monroe County News.
[00:11:18.996 --> 00:11:21.579]  I mean, I don't know until I have more info.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.601]  Read that again.
[00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:35.208]  Monroe County authorities released two Mexican men without charges after seizing $105,000 in cash and several other items from their vehicle.
[00:11:35.248 --> 00:11:36.148]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:11:36.568 --> 00:11:37.489]  Well, that's what happens.
[00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:44.271]  The police, most of the time, it's come out in big cities especially, they just keep the drug money, cash, and just let people go.
[00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:46.452]  Especially if they're illegal aliens.
[00:11:46.492 --> 00:11:47.953]  This is the point I make every day.
[00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:48.953]  Stay there.
[00:11:49.553 --> 00:11:53.815]  We're going to come back and try to find that article and show people that on air.
[00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:55.235]  On the other side.
[00:11:55.275 --> 00:11:55.936]  We'll be right back.
[00:11:55.956 --> 00:11:56.336]  Stay with us.

[00:13:02.092 --> 00:13:07.259]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.867]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[00:13:14.229 --> 00:13:15.070]  The value of the U.S.
[00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.031]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.

[00:16:03.592 --> 00:16:06.514]  You know, I talk about this almost every day.
[00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:10.796]  And that is that it's on record all over the country.
[00:16:10.816 --> 00:16:27.726]  In fact, many of the cases I've seen have been in Tennessee, where sheriffs will arrest a van, in one case with 14 illegal aliens in it, with the coyote driving with a bunch of cash, and the feds say, keep the cash, and it turned out it was the money that the illegals had paid thousands to be brought into the U.S.,
[00:16:29.727 --> 00:16:33.468]  But let the illegal aliens go, and here is KnoxNews.com.
[00:16:34.888 --> 00:16:37.629]  We're on in Knoxville, Tennessee, WBCR.
[00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:39.029]  Great folks down there.
[00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:46.011]  Deputy sees $105,000 after Mexicans deny cash was theirs.
[00:16:47.011 --> 00:16:50.992]  And I'm glad the caller called in with this info because this just adds to what I'm talking about.
[00:16:52.113 --> 00:16:53.633]  All over the United States,
[00:16:54.841 --> 00:17:01.175]  Drunk driving, assault, arson, rape, child molestation.
[00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:13.770]  I've seen countless articles where the illegals get caught, and then the judges let them go with a $1 fine, $50 fine, $200 fine, and they just disappear into the ether.
[00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:23.154]  Imagine, we've got 30 million people here who are illegal aliens from all over the world, and a large portion of them are criminals that have been fleeing justice in their own nations.
[00:17:23.534 --> 00:17:25.775]  They come here and they're just absolutely above the law.
[00:17:27.665 --> 00:17:34.390]  An improper lane change on Interstate 75 led to a nearly $105,000 windfall from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office.
[00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:46.759]  Deputy Bobby Queen, on Tuesday, saw a blue Mazda SRX6 make an improper lane change while traveling on I-75 near the 60-mile marker, according to Queen's report.
[00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:53.884]  When Queen stopped the car about 1.30 p.m., the driver said he was returning to Mexico in a rental vehicle after a three-day stay in New York City.
[00:17:54.304 --> 00:17:56.446]  A female accompanied the 32-year-old driver.
[00:17:57.469 --> 00:18:00.130]  With consent, the driver, Queen starts the vehicle.
[00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.151]  With consent.
[00:18:02.471 --> 00:18:04.472]  I found six vacuum-sealed packages of U.S.
[00:18:04.492 --> 00:18:08.834]  currency wrapped in tinfoil in the right rear quarter panel.
[00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:10.014]  You know why they wrap them in tinfoil?
[00:18:10.034 --> 00:18:13.576]  Because the scanners then can't read the little magnetic strip that's in them.
[00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:17.160]  Behind the carpet in the trunk, Queen wrote.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.881]  Both occupants denied knowledge and ownership of the currency.
[00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:25.683]  Queen seized the $104,000 in cash and gave the driver a receipt for the money.
[00:18:26.223 --> 00:18:29.504]  The driver and the passenger were allowed to continue on their journey, according to the report.
[00:18:29.724 --> 00:18:32.625]  See, it's encouraged for them to be just turned loose.
[00:18:33.686 --> 00:18:35.086]  And this is what happens.
[00:18:36.467 --> 00:18:44.130]  I've been talking to somebody who works with the county, and I need to try to do an interview with them and have a voice changer.
[00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:47.706]  Because they don't want to be revealed who they are.
[00:18:48.407 --> 00:18:55.975]  And they have shown me information, they want to show me more documents, where there's internal fights going on in Travis County and Austin.
[00:18:55.995 --> 00:19:04.283]  Because in one case they were showing me last year, an illegal alien had crashed a car into somebody when he was drunk.
[00:19:05.565 --> 00:19:06.305]  He was just let go.
[00:19:07.226 --> 00:19:07.567]  No jail.
[00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:17.993]  Then he, a few weeks later, crashed into a cop car with a cop in it transporting a suspect and hurt both the people inside.
[00:19:18.554 --> 00:19:19.935]  And you never see that on the news.
[00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:21.156]  And then still nothing was done.
[00:19:22.216 --> 00:19:27.102]  But they pull a citizen over, a Hispanic American, Black American, White American, Asian American.
[00:19:27.663 --> 00:19:29.866]  It is just bonanza time.
[00:19:30.727 --> 00:19:34.912]  I mean, they pull over one of the, they've been told, have your way with these people.
[00:19:34.992 --> 00:19:36.734]  Do whatever you want.
[00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:38.456]  Drive them into submission.
[00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:39.958]  Make them afraid of you.
[00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:44.164]  Remember the police chief in Bergen County a couple years ago?
[00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.726]  In fact, pull this up.
[00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:50.653]  Police chief admits black mask, black uniforms for intimidation.
[00:19:51.034 --> 00:19:52.235]  People won't believe it if I don't pull it up.
[00:19:52.656 --> 00:19:54.218]  We've always known it's for intimidation.
[00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:56.682]  And coming up we have this Orwellian...
[00:19:57.623 --> 00:20:02.165]  Big Brother tax collection commercial that's airing, saying, Big Brother is watching you.
[00:20:02.706 --> 00:20:04.086]  We have control of you.
[00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:05.547]  Give us all the money.
[00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:10.009]  And it says it in this voice, like, we are the Borg.
[00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.570]  You will be assimilated.
[00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.971]  Resistance is futile.
[00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:14.932]  Paul in Tennessee, are you still there?
[00:20:14.952 --> 00:20:15.732]  Yes, sir.
[00:20:15.752 --> 00:20:16.413]  I was waiting for you.
[00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.534]  I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention.
[00:20:18.554 --> 00:20:19.434]  Now, what's your take on it?
[00:20:19.855 --> 00:20:20.515]  You're very welcome.
[00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:24.377]  I've seen this happen time and time again all over the country.
[00:20:24.417 --> 00:20:26.438]  I mean, before I lived in Tennessee, I was in Florida.
[00:20:27.308 --> 00:20:31.450]  And before that, I'm a Texan too, so I've been all over the place.
[00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.811]  One more quick story from Florida.
[00:20:34.331 --> 00:20:39.333]  My parents had a vacant investment property down there that I maintain the lawn on.
[00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:46.416]  One day I went over there, there was a van with three Mexicans in it, directly in the middle of the front yard, stuck in the mud.
[00:20:47.217 --> 00:20:50.238]  And the thing had no tags on it or anything, and I'm going, this is kind of bad.
[00:20:50.278 --> 00:20:52.919]  I went over, I talked to them, and there had been a lot of robberies in the neighborhood.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.540]  And I asked them, I said, you know, well, what's going on here?
[00:20:55.561 --> 00:20:56.541]  How come you're in the middle of the lawn?
[00:20:57.455 --> 00:21:03.560]  And, uh, they didn't speak a lick of English, so I called the police because I was, I thought they were trying to attempt to rob the house.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.502]  And, uh, took the police 30 minutes to get there.
[00:21:06.662 --> 00:21:08.003]  By that time they'd pulled the van out.
[00:21:08.404 --> 00:21:09.905]  I told the cop he went down that way.
[00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:11.506]  The cop found them.
[00:21:12.687 --> 00:21:17.110]  And, uh, then he came back to me and he said, uh, yeah, he said, well, they were just test driving it.
[00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:18.691]  I said, well, did you arrest them?
[00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:20.913]  I said, they didn't have a tag on the van or anything.
[00:21:20.933 --> 00:21:23.655]  He goes, no, no, I just, they just said they were test driving it.
[00:21:23.695 --> 00:21:24.396]  Now, if that was me,
[00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:28.549]  My butt would have been in Sarasota County Jail quicker than you could say Jack Spratt.
[00:21:29.109 --> 00:21:31.831]  And if you'd have talked back, you'd have been billy clubbed and tasered.
[00:21:31.951 --> 00:21:36.194]  Because you are a scum American who lives for one reason.
[00:21:36.435 --> 00:21:39.257]  To work for the state and pay money to Goldman Sachs.
[00:21:39.677 --> 00:21:43.960]  You are trash, the illegals are God, and you ought to thank them if they burn down major cities.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.181]  It's what you deserve.
[00:21:45.421 --> 00:21:46.382]  Trash America.
[00:21:49.565 --> 00:21:50.485]  We're on the march.
[00:21:50.946 --> 00:21:52.467]  The empire's on the run.

[00:22:05.874 --> 00:22:10.636]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:17.799]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[00:23:59.008 --> 00:24:01.609]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:06.972]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:24:07.352 --> 00:24:09.073]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:24:09.393 --> 00:24:14.215]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:24:14.395 --> 00:24:15.355]  How much do you want?
[00:24:15.576 --> 00:24:16.296]  When do you want it?
[00:24:16.696 --> 00:24:18.298]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:24:18.578 --> 00:24:19.399]  When will you need it?
[00:24:19.659 --> 00:24:21.721]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:22.962]  Will there be any food?
[00:24:23.182 --> 00:24:24.523]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:29.788]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:24:29.988 --> 00:24:33.171]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:37.035]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:24:37.395 --> 00:24:38.376]  How much will you need?
[00:24:38.616 --> 00:24:39.217]  We don't know.
[00:24:39.517 --> 00:24:40.418]  How much do you want?
[00:24:40.618 --> 00:24:41.338]  All you can get.
[00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:42.399]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.402]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:24:45.702 --> 00:24:47.444]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:47.464 --> 00:24:48.384]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.471]  We are back live.
[00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:06.051]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:25:06.091 --> 00:25:16.077]  Greg Pallast, BBC reporter, to talk about the Goldman Sachs global banking takeover and what's happening in Greece and the United States is coming up for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:19.138]  Then we'll continue with the news and your phone calls.
[00:25:19.298 --> 00:25:19.618]  Okay.
[00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:27.443]  Just to prove to you here, yet again, that if I just throw something out from a few years ago, that I don't make it up.
[00:25:28.823 --> 00:25:29.164]  Okay?
[00:25:29.184 --> 00:25:31.625]  And then we're getting into the whole illegal alien situation.
[00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:44.413]  For PrisonPlanet.TV members, you can watch this on the document cam right now, but for those of you just listening on the radio, Google, Massachusetts police get black uniforms to instill sense of fear.
[00:25:44.973 --> 00:25:48.914]  That's the police commissioner, William Fichette, saying that April 24, 2008.
[00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:54.895]  I told the guys to search engine, police get black uniforms to instill fear.
[00:25:55.255 --> 00:25:56.695]  They found one in Massachusetts.
[00:25:57.275 --> 00:26:00.896]  The one I was remembering was out of New Jersey.
[00:26:02.156 --> 00:26:06.858]  So there is a article on that front for everyone.
[00:26:07.458 --> 00:26:09.159]  Okay, continuing now.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.920]  I did find this here in my stack.
[00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:15.042]  First, I want to show you a photo.
[00:26:16.002 --> 00:26:18.123]  We'll put it up on the main screen for folks so they can read it.
[00:26:18.723 --> 00:26:23.425]  And we have this photo posted up on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:24.706 --> 00:26:30.528]  It's a pro-illegal immigration protester threatens to murder police.
[00:26:33.931 --> 00:26:36.273]  A photo does tell a thousand words.
[00:26:36.313 --> 00:26:38.874]  You can get that up at InfoWars.com.
[00:26:39.895 --> 00:26:50.942]  And if you just go through the videos and photos online and randomly pause the signs in California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, New York, Florida, this is not a joke sign.
[00:26:50.962 --> 00:26:55.224]  I mean, you can see the illegal alien protester there, and he's got his sign.
[00:26:55.264 --> 00:26:56.825]  Let's put it back up on screen for people.
[00:26:57.205 --> 00:26:59.527]  And I'm going to read this to folks here on air.
[00:27:00.287 --> 00:27:01.348]  Give us free.
[00:27:01.648 --> 00:27:02.549]  Free is underlined.
[00:27:03.803 --> 00:27:08.946]  Health care, jobs, no taxes, house, food.
[00:27:09.366 --> 00:27:10.787]  You owe us, America.
[00:27:10.807 --> 00:27:17.970]  Because the media has taught the illegals that they literally make the grass grow, the sun shine, that birds tweet.
[00:27:18.311 --> 00:27:23.673]  And then it says, we will shoot more police in Arizona until we get free.
[00:27:24.214 --> 00:27:25.334]  Yeah, what's going on in Mexico?
[00:27:25.354 --> 00:27:27.715]  20 plus thousand dead people the last two years.
[00:27:28.756 --> 00:27:30.317]  Over what, 7,000 of them police?
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.040]  We will shoot police.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:40.944]  Can you imagine if I went out with a sign saying, arrest the Federal Reserve Chiefs, give us our country back, or I will shoot police?
[00:27:41.124 --> 00:27:41.924]  I would never do that.
[00:27:42.444 --> 00:27:43.625]  I'm calling for nonviolence.
[00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:57.451]  So I have the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, New York Times, Time Magazine, London Guardian, New York Daily News, Austin American Statesman, writing articles saying I'm calling for violence, and that I supported Joe Stack flying a plane into a building, when day one,
[00:27:58.251 --> 00:28:00.632]  Within an hour and a half of that happening, I went live on air.
[00:28:00.672 --> 00:28:01.172]  Less than an hour.
[00:28:01.192 --> 00:28:03.193]  It happened right before 10 o'clock.
[00:28:03.213 --> 00:28:04.093]  I went on air at 11.
[00:28:04.713 --> 00:28:05.954]  I said, this will be blamed on me.
[00:28:06.054 --> 00:28:06.394]  Watch.
[00:28:07.054 --> 00:28:08.195]  And this is a staged event.
[00:28:08.235 --> 00:28:09.175]  And the evidence came out.
[00:28:09.195 --> 00:28:10.015]  It was staged.
[00:28:10.396 --> 00:28:11.716]  They had the emergency crews there.
[00:28:11.876 --> 00:28:13.117]  People said there was no one in the plane.
[00:28:13.337 --> 00:28:14.737]  He was involved with Homeland Security.
[00:28:14.757 --> 00:28:15.898]  His family says it's a cover-up.
[00:28:16.098 --> 00:28:21.280]  The guy that owned the hangar, the small hangar his plane was in, is the top Homeland Security expert on remote control aircraft.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.541]  And within two and a half hours, they blamed me for it.
[00:28:26.892 --> 00:28:28.414]  I mean, I know how this works.
[00:28:28.654 --> 00:28:30.196]  So here I am being blamed.
[00:28:30.456 --> 00:28:31.738]  Here's the Tea Party being blamed.
[00:28:31.938 --> 00:28:37.264]  You have this aborted truck bomb in Times Square on Commie Day on May Day.
[00:28:38.732 --> 00:28:46.277]  And the media first says it's Al Qaeda, an Israeli front group known for putting out fake videos, posting videos saying Taliban's taking credit.
[00:28:46.517 --> 00:28:47.577]  Turns out that's fake.
[00:28:47.838 --> 00:28:50.059]  Now the media says, is it a Tea Party person?
[00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:53.021]  They show a white male around the car saying maybe it's him.
[00:28:53.681 --> 00:28:56.543]  And we're just bracing for it to be blamed on the American people right now.
[00:28:56.923 --> 00:29:03.167]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens, and I'm going to show you these mainstream news articles, here it is, Santa Cruz Sentinel.
[00:29:04.895 --> 00:29:08.896]  Downtown Santa Cruz, windows broken on dozens of businesses, now over 20.
[00:29:09.276 --> 00:29:11.397]  Porch of Cafe set on fire.
[00:29:13.898 --> 00:29:16.178]  Here's the Star Tribune Associated Press.
[00:29:16.198 --> 00:29:23.280]  18 businesses damaged after immigrants' rights march turns violent in Santa Cruz, California.
[00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:26.041]  And again, that's from yesterday, it's now more businesses.
[00:29:27.002 --> 00:29:29.542]  And it says close to 20 businesses were damaged.
[00:29:29.962 --> 00:29:31.283]  And these articles go on to talk about
[00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:38.312]  People with burning torches, running around setting fire to a restaurant with families in it eating.
[00:29:39.332 --> 00:29:44.353]  Now, if I did that or you did that, you'd be charged with attempted murder, and we should be charged with attempted murder.
[00:29:44.853 --> 00:29:55.556]  If anybody, black, white, hispanic, purple, green, polka dotted, I don't care, you run around, start setting fires to restaurants full of people, you need to go to prison for about 50 years.
[00:29:55.956 --> 00:29:56.096]  No.
[00:29:57.076 --> 00:30:00.739]  I don't know if I have time, but we have the ABC newscast that was local.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.581]  It's a national blackout.
[00:30:03.222 --> 00:30:06.305]  It's in Paul Watson's article about this, if you want to go watch it in full.
[00:30:06.605 --> 00:30:16.034]  You can hear business owners in the background when the news does a live report, never saying it was an illegal alien march, screaming, deport the illegals, they did this.
[00:30:18.418 --> 00:30:21.480]  So the local news will not even say it was an illegal alien march.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:27.662]  We went and pulled up the local websites where they were saying a week before they were going to go out there and do this and they were calling for violence.
[00:30:28.383 --> 00:30:33.845]  Now, were the police watching the illegal alien groups saying they were going to go engage in violence a week before?
[00:30:34.385 --> 00:30:34.545]  No.
[00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:35.926]  No, they weren't.
[00:30:37.176 --> 00:30:43.759]  Were the police watching these groups when they attacked police a week and a half ago in Phoenix, screaming, we will kill you with pickaxes?
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.840]  I played that clip earlier in the hour?
[00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:46.501]  No.
[00:30:47.241 --> 00:30:47.381]  No.
[00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:57.787]  The police are too busy training with the Army, with training manuals with my name in it, saying I'm calling for their murder, I'm calling for death and killing, and the Tea Parties are violent terrorists.
[00:30:58.737 --> 00:31:01.117]  That's what's going on in America.
[00:31:01.477 --> 00:31:03.418]  That's what's happening in this country.
[00:31:03.758 --> 00:31:14.720]  And in the sickening ABC piece that you can go watch, that's posted in Watson's article that boils all this down, they talk to two witnesses who support it and say, I understand why they did it.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.040]  They have a good reason to do it.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.181]  This disgusting newscast defends what happened.
[00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:22.361]  You want to go watch the video?
[00:31:22.761 --> 00:31:27.422]  We've got it all boiled down, the violence all over the country, linked, including Santa Cruz, California.
[00:31:28.763 --> 00:31:31.304]  Pro-illegal immigration thugs terrorize Santa Cruz.
[00:31:31.925 --> 00:31:33.065]  Corporate media shrugs.
[00:31:33.446 --> 00:31:37.328]  And you can go into the article and watch the video I'm talking about.
[00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:38.388]  The cover-up.
[00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:44.211]  The cover-up of the torching that is going on.
[00:31:44.391 --> 00:31:45.112]  Here's another one.
[00:31:45.572 --> 00:31:50.455]  This is out of ABC News, KGOTV.
[00:31:52.736 --> 00:31:55.738]  Thousands across Bay Area protest Arizona law.
[00:31:56.378 --> 00:31:57.879]  And then buried in the article
[00:31:58.948 --> 00:32:03.378]  It talks about how they assaulted a counter-demonstration of Tea Party people.
[00:32:04.281 --> 00:32:06.663]  Beat them up, screaming, you are racist.
[00:32:06.743 --> 00:32:06.983]  See?
[00:32:07.984 --> 00:32:16.110]  If you don't like groups with signs saying, we're going to kill cops, we're going to burn things down, we're going to kill you with pickaxes, and you say, look, man, the country's going bankrupt.
[00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.912]  Look, the big banks are the ones that ruined Mexico.
[00:32:19.193 --> 00:32:20.293]  Your country's collapsing.
[00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:21.835]  It's going into a total police state.
[00:32:22.195 --> 00:32:26.478]  You don't have a right to come up here and declare this Mexico or Latin America.
[00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:30.461]  And then when you do that, you get physically attacked and the mainstream media
[00:32:31.604 --> 00:32:38.187]  Basically engages in a giant cover-up of the entire situation.
[00:32:39.067 --> 00:32:48.112]  Then I have several other articles dealing with what's actually happening in Mexico right now.
[00:32:48.392 --> 00:32:51.593]  Give me a document cam shot on this boys at PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers.
[00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:57.416]  Mexico to fingerprint phone users in fight
[00:32:59.585 --> 00:33:00.406]  To fight crime.
[00:33:00.986 --> 00:33:01.586]  That's Reuters.
[00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:02.427]  Here's another one.
[00:33:04.028 --> 00:33:04.668]  London Guardian.
[00:33:04.908 --> 00:33:07.270]  Caught in the crossfire of an unwinnable war.
[00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:08.570]  Oh, they could win it.
[00:33:08.671 --> 00:33:12.273]  They could decriminalize the drugs and they'd have almost no value.
[00:33:12.853 --> 00:33:14.634]  Be as valuable as coffee or beans.
[00:33:15.214 --> 00:33:16.375]  Be as valuable as corn.
[00:33:16.715 --> 00:33:17.416]  Maybe a little more.
[00:33:18.136 --> 00:33:19.577]  But no, that's never going to happen.
[00:33:19.857 --> 00:33:25.521]  You cannot decriminalize it because that's what the private intelligence agencies are using to overthrow
[00:33:26.826 --> 00:33:32.447]  A hundred plus years ago, China to overthrow Afghanistan, to overthrow the United States, to overthrow Mexico.
[00:33:32.747 --> 00:33:34.028]  And remember what I played yesterday?
[00:33:35.688 --> 00:33:37.308]  Remember what I played here on air?
[00:33:37.328 --> 00:33:39.069]  In fact, I ought to just play it again for new listeners.
[00:33:39.489 --> 00:33:47.411]  Fox News comes out and reports what we already knew, but the incredible thing is it's out in the open, that the U.S.
[00:33:47.551 --> 00:33:56.313]  Army is helping grow and protect the record levels of opium, since our government took over, that are pouring out of Afghanistan into the United States, and it's what we have to do.
[00:34:00.026 --> 00:34:00.926]  In fact, look right over here.
[00:34:02.627 --> 00:34:03.167]  Look right here.
[00:34:03.407 --> 00:34:04.388]  Document cam on this.
[00:34:05.348 --> 00:34:08.990]  NATO rejects Russian call for Afghan poppy spraying.
[00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.331]  The Russians said, why don't you just eradicate the poppy fields?
[00:34:12.631 --> 00:34:13.792]  It would take a few weeks to do it.
[00:34:14.192 --> 00:34:15.172]  Why don't you just spray them?
[00:34:15.472 --> 00:34:16.953]  And NATO said, we're not going to do that.
[00:34:19.134 --> 00:34:20.114]  Here's the New York Times.
[00:34:20.614 --> 00:34:20.935]  U.S.
[00:34:20.955 --> 00:34:23.356]  turns a blind eye to opium in Afghan town.
[00:34:24.176 --> 00:34:25.216]  This is a tactic they use.
[00:34:25.276 --> 00:34:26.337]  It's going on all over the country.
[00:34:27.537 --> 00:34:29.880]  But they just come out with one town where it's happening.
[00:34:31.982 --> 00:34:36.788]  Well, we played you the video of the Marine commander saying, I don't like it, but we've got to do this.
[00:34:37.089 --> 00:34:38.711]  We've got to help them grow their crops.
[00:34:39.331 --> 00:34:41.134]  Because if we don't, they'll side with the Taliban.
[00:34:43.763 --> 00:34:46.745]  And the Orwellian headline is, Fighting the Opium Trade, U.S.
[00:34:46.765 --> 00:34:48.947]  Troops Fight Vicious Circle.
[00:34:48.967 --> 00:34:50.048]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[00:34:50.328 --> 00:34:55.972]  Cue up the video to the start, let's just play a few minutes of that, before I explain what's going to be done to the United States and Mexico.
[00:34:56.253 --> 00:34:59.655]  This is the implosion of North America into the North American Union.
[00:35:00.376 --> 00:35:13.126]  Judicial Watch sued in 2007, got the documents from the SPP meeting, Security Prosperity Partnership, and they said, we will use deteriorating security issues in Mexico to merge the three nations.
[00:35:14.198 --> 00:35:21.435]  And to have our military joint drain, we will use biological events like flu, and we will use financial collapse to do it.
[00:35:22.016 --> 00:35:23.680]  Mexico has now completely...
[00:35:24.824 --> 00:35:25.464]  Collapsed.
[00:35:26.805 --> 00:35:30.047]  And look, the same thing is now being proposed here in the United States.
[00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:39.393]  Everyone that gets a cell phone under the 1996 law, your cell phone's being tracked, traced, everything's being recorded, everything's being controlled.
[00:35:39.674 --> 00:35:40.674]  It's totally illegal.
[00:35:41.175 --> 00:35:45.818]  They pass it in a spending bill to put the control grid in, but legally it's unlawful.
[00:35:46.098 --> 00:35:46.718]  Here's Reuters.
[00:35:47.018 --> 00:35:50.521]  Mexico fingerprint phone users in crime fight.
[00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:51.821]  In crime fight.
[00:35:52.142 --> 00:35:57.405]  The government is waging war against smaller cartels that aren't laundering their money through their system.
[00:35:57.685 --> 00:35:58.265]  When U.S.
[00:35:58.305 --> 00:36:04.288]  troops are down in Colombia, it's on record that they have GPS systems where they only spray certain coca fields.
[00:36:04.548 --> 00:36:06.730]  They don't spray the others that they control.
[00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:17.816]  You see, so there is some war going on in Afghanistan, but that's only to mop up groups and tribes that are growing poppies that produce opium and heroin that aren't paying their cut.
[00:36:18.757 --> 00:36:21.340]  It's $500 billion a year industry out of Afghanistan.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.364]  Over $500 billion on narcotics coming into the United States out of Mexico every year.
[00:36:26.626 --> 00:36:28.347]  And now because the troops are speaking up.
[00:36:28.408 --> 00:36:29.749]  Now because the troops are informed.
[00:36:29.989 --> 00:36:31.331]  Now because the troops are involved.
[00:36:31.571 --> 00:36:33.113]  Now because the troops know what's going on.
[00:36:34.548 --> 00:36:36.189]  They're going, why are we here growing opium?
[00:36:36.269 --> 00:36:38.750]  They have to come out and hide it in plain view and go, it's no big deal guys.
[00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.810]  Everybody knows.
[00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:40.911]  See, here's Geraldo.
[00:36:40.931 --> 00:36:41.751]  We're on TV.
[00:36:42.031 --> 00:36:46.153]  They have the troops all stand around and they hear Geraldo explain how it's okay with the commander.
[00:36:46.493 --> 00:36:47.613]  To just normalize it.
[00:36:47.793 --> 00:36:49.034]  To hide the thing in plain view.
[00:36:50.816 --> 00:36:57.160]  Remember just six months ago I was a kook liar for saying our government's controlling almost all the opium in Afghanistan and shipping it in?
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.221]  Now it's in your face.
[00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:07.307]  But see how they use this police state as a pretext to control our lives, run checkpoints, federalize our police, and then in Mexico they just tell the public.
[00:37:08.047 --> 00:37:21.691]  You've got a thumbprint to get a phone, everything you do is recorded, everywhere you go is tracked, or you can't have a cell phone, and what Carlos Slim, the richest guy in the world, he owns almost all of the cell phone systems, has almost a complete monopoly in Mexico.
[00:37:22.772 --> 00:37:30.274]  One of the poorest groups of people, the richest guy, reportedly, on paper, he's nouveau riche, the real money hides it, like the Rockefellers and others.
[00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:34.999]  Mexico to fingerprint phone users in crime fight.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:46.331]  Mexico will start a national register of mobile phone users that will include fingerprinting all customers in an effort to catch criminals who use the devices to extort money and negotiate kidnapping ransoms.
[00:37:47.386 --> 00:37:56.732]  So see, because somebody uses a phone for drug dealing or somebody might use a phone for kidnapping, we've got to now register and track everything you do.
[00:37:57.332 --> 00:37:59.353]  Somebody might use propane as a bomb.
[00:37:59.693 --> 00:38:01.174]  Now we've got to register propane.
[00:38:01.535 --> 00:38:03.576]  Somebody might use gasoline as a bomb.
[00:38:03.836 --> 00:38:07.858]  Now we've got to register and make you have a license to buy gas and track everything you do.
[00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:10.080]  Somebody might use a car as a weapon.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.901]  Now we've got to restrict your cars.
[00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:14.002]  Somebody might use a baseball bat.
[00:38:14.042 --> 00:38:15.522]  Now we've got to restrict baseball bats.
[00:38:15.862 --> 00:38:17.343]  Somebody might use a butcher knife.
[00:38:17.463 --> 00:38:18.363]  England's already doing that.
[00:38:18.803 --> 00:38:20.204]  Making you get licenses for knives.
[00:38:20.224 --> 00:38:20.804]  They're proposing it.
[00:38:22.064 --> 00:38:23.765]  Somebody might use a gun in a crime.
[00:38:23.945 --> 00:38:25.825]  So we've got to take all your guns or register them.
[00:38:26.205 --> 00:38:27.526]  See how this psychology works?
[00:38:27.966 --> 00:38:36.949]  Mexico will start a national register of mobile phone users that will include fingerprinting all customers in an effort to catch criminals who use devices to extort money and negotiate kidnapping ransoms.
[00:38:37.569 --> 00:38:41.151]  No, now they'll just come in with sat phones that cost 500 bucks, as if they won't get those.
[00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:43.092]  No, they want to keep track of their slaves.
[00:38:43.372 --> 00:38:44.653]  This is total martial law.
[00:38:45.193 --> 00:38:55.359]  Under a new law, pushed on Monday, and due to be in force in April, mobile phone companies will have a year to build up a database of their clients, complete with fingerprints.
[00:38:55.419 --> 00:38:59.662]  The idea would be to match calls and messages to the phone owners.
[00:39:00.262 --> 00:39:02.343]  Hundreds of people are kidnapped in Mexico every year.
[00:39:02.363 --> 00:39:03.104]  How about thousands?
[00:39:03.504 --> 00:39:09.327]  And the number of victims is rising sharply as drug gangs under pressure from any army crackdown seek new income.
[00:39:11.608 --> 00:39:14.149]  This is lawmakers pushed the bill through Congress last week.
[00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:18.692]  So that's the type of news that we have here.
[00:39:19.605 --> 00:39:22.826]  This is a total criminal system taking over.
[00:39:23.406 --> 00:39:32.628]  And the United States, in the SPP, North American Union documents, three years ago they said, we will use deteriorating security in the U.S.
[00:39:32.648 --> 00:39:36.389]  from Mexico as a pretext to go after people's freedoms.
[00:39:36.949 --> 00:39:47.771]  They said we'll use a global government, North American Union, this is a quote, by stealth approach, also for carbon taxes.
[00:39:49.335 --> 00:39:51.216]  And who runs that SPP council?
[00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:54.257]  The State Departments of Mexico, Canada, and the U.S.
[00:39:54.317 --> 00:40:04.401]  and they sit on boards, this is in the documents, thousands of pages, that we've read and then shot video of and I put in my film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:40:05.363 --> 00:40:07.364]  All admitted what they're going to do.
[00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:12.367]  If you don't decriminalize drugs now, we are going to collapse just like Mexico.
[00:40:12.687 --> 00:40:18.411]  And the kidnappings are already exploding everywhere, and when the illegals kidnap your kids, they just keep it real quiet.
[00:40:19.131 --> 00:40:26.175]  If somebody else kidnaps a kid, it's frothing and crying and freaking out, and the feds are going to save us, and it's all over the news and press conferences.
[00:40:26.495 --> 00:40:34.160]  But when people are being kidnapped every day, in Texas, in Arizona, in California, in Nevada, your kid doesn't even get a milk carton.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:41.784]  And then you pay the 500 grand or whatever, your whole family sells everything they got, and then you might be lucky if your kid comes back.
[00:40:42.024 --> 00:40:45.247]  And they chop a finger off, send it back, doesn't make the news.
[00:40:45.847 --> 00:40:50.850]  Illegals burn Santa Cruz, set fires, run around racially attacking people.
[00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:59.837]  Makes the local news, but on the local news they don't even tell you it was illegals, but the AP went and noticed it was their own website bragging it was a quote, immigrant march.
[00:41:01.518 --> 00:41:02.558]  Like, where's that headline again?
[00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:03.019]  I'll just, uh...
[00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:07.743]  I'll just neurotically read you that headline again.
[00:41:07.783 --> 00:41:08.223]  Here we go.
[00:41:11.405 --> 00:41:13.146]  ABC News San Francisco.
[00:41:13.166 --> 00:41:16.008]  AP.
[00:41:16.028 --> 00:41:19.890]  18 businesses damaged after immigrants' rights march turns violent.
[00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:20.930]  Turns violent.
[00:41:21.291 --> 00:41:23.232]  Riot breaks out in downtown Santa Cruz.
[00:41:24.072 --> 00:41:25.013]  Carrying torches.
[00:41:26.803 --> 00:41:33.207]  But the mainstream media wants to know why everybody's tuning out, why people don't trust them, why people don't believe anything they say anymore.
[00:41:33.447 --> 00:41:34.948]  It's because of stuff like this.
[00:41:35.568 --> 00:41:37.329]  It should be all over the news what happened.
[00:41:37.709 --> 00:41:40.491]  We're going to come back and take your calls and Greg Pallis is coming up with us.
[00:41:41.111 --> 00:41:43.012]  And I haven't even gotten into the banking takeover yet.
[00:41:43.032 --> 00:41:45.254]  We'll be covering that with him.
[00:41:45.274 --> 00:41:55.800]  And then I want to get into this article that is so important.
[00:41:56.846 --> 00:42:00.107]  Orwellian Big Brother Tax Collection Commercial airs in Pennsylvania.
[00:42:00.407 --> 00:42:02.327]  Wait till you see and hear this.
[00:42:02.627 --> 00:42:08.389]  But closing out on the subject of Mexico, here's another one we mentioned earlier, KnoxNews.com, Knoxville News.
[00:42:09.429 --> 00:42:14.350]  Deputy sees $105,000 and for Mexicans to deny cash was theirs, they just let him go.
[00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:15.091]  Oh!
[00:42:16.231 --> 00:42:18.671]  You got $105,000 of drug money in your car?
[00:42:18.691 --> 00:42:20.452]  You're illegal aliens in the U.S.?
[00:42:21.252 --> 00:42:22.332]  You're driving a rent car?
[00:42:22.392 --> 00:42:23.613]  Bye-bye, you're gone.
[00:42:23.913 --> 00:42:24.813]  We're gonna let you go.
[00:42:26.226 --> 00:42:35.995]  Meanwhile, they're announcing that in the legalization immigration bill, it's a national ID card, this is AP, included in Democratic immigration bill.
[00:42:37.318 --> 00:42:38.879]  But citizens have to have it.
[00:42:38.899 --> 00:42:39.980]  The illegals are exempt.
[00:42:40.441 --> 00:42:44.064]  So see, they tell you there's an amnesty bill, and it is an amnesty bill.
[00:42:44.424 --> 00:42:47.006]  It fixes the illegal alien problem because it just legalizes them.
[00:42:47.266 --> 00:42:55.393]  But then you as a citizen have got a federal ID you've got to have to get your paycheck and to buy and sell for the new national sales tax.
[00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:57.535]  You've got to have that new card, slaves.
[00:42:59.712 --> 00:43:01.393]  Oh, my sinuses!
[00:43:01.453 --> 00:43:03.194]  They feel like they'll explode!
[00:43:03.394 --> 00:43:04.074]  Sinus pressure.
[00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:05.895]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:43:05.995 --> 00:43:07.116]  You've struggled for years.
[00:43:07.236 --> 00:43:12.899]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:43:13.099 --> 00:43:13.679]  Sound familiar?
[00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:14.660]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.362]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:43:18.542 --> 00:43:23.404]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[00:43:23.584 --> 00:43:26.005]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor-recommended.

[00:46:02.546 --> 00:46:04.629]  This is breaking hot off the presses.
[00:46:04.649 --> 00:46:06.151]  We're printing it off right now.
[00:46:06.692 --> 00:46:10.317]  Judges ruled the Hattari militia can be released on their own recognizance.
[00:46:10.938 --> 00:46:18.708]  It was all a giant hoax with feds inside for years, just trying to get one of them to say, yeah, we may have to fight the government someday.
[00:46:19.389 --> 00:46:26.392]  I mean, you get some militia guys, a former school teacher administrator, to say, yeah, the New World Order's coming down on us, we may have to do something sometime.
[00:46:26.732 --> 00:46:30.173]  They had an FBI agent and an informant inside posing as their members.
[00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:34.495]  We're now going to be able to find out, hopefully, who those feds were.
[00:46:34.935 --> 00:46:36.616]  But we know that they provocateured it.
[00:46:36.956 --> 00:46:38.057]  We know it was a setup.
[00:46:38.417 --> 00:46:41.318]  I warned Hitari in August of last year they were being set up.
[00:46:42.469 --> 00:46:48.391]  So of course, feds out there posing as militia commanders criticize me saying, don't you say you hate the militia!
[00:46:48.431 --> 00:46:49.612]  I never said that.
[00:46:49.632 --> 00:46:50.852]  That's more straw man lies.
[00:46:51.272 --> 00:46:53.753]  I said they set up Atari and I was right.
[00:46:54.594 --> 00:46:59.575]  Okay, so judge, militia members can leave jail until trial.
[00:47:00.076 --> 00:47:01.956]  They better watch their butts.
[00:47:01.996 --> 00:47:03.517]  This is a big defeat for the globalists.
[00:47:04.157 --> 00:47:10.660]  Judge says nine members of the Michigan-based militia accused of trying to plot war against the government can be released from jail while awaiting trial.
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.140]  This is AP.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:12.240]  U.S.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:18.224]  District Judge Victoria Roberts on Monday overturned the April 2nd decision of a federal magistrate judge.
[00:47:18.244 --> 00:47:23.046]  She says all can be released with electronic monitoring devices and other strict conditions.
[00:47:23.427 --> 00:47:28.750]  The government says the nine members of the Southern Michigan militia called Atari are radicals who plan to kill police.
[00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:29.310]  Really?
[00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:31.311]  Show the photo who said they'll kill police.
[00:47:31.611 --> 00:47:35.854]  Show the illegal aliens out there saying they're going to kill us with pickaxes and they're going to kill police.
[00:47:36.454 --> 00:47:43.202]  That's an act of terrorism to say, give me free health care, give me free rent, give me a free house, or I will kill police.
[00:47:44.424 --> 00:47:45.945]  Says, give us free health care!
[00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:46.867]  Jobs!
[00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:50.386]  No taxes, house, food.
[00:47:50.886 --> 00:47:52.047]  You owe us, America.
[00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:55.528]  We will shoot more police in Arizona until we get free.
[00:47:55.989 --> 00:47:57.189]  And look at that guy.
[00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:59.690]  Bottom dollar, that's an illegal alien.
[00:48:01.551 --> 00:48:06.854]  I've been to rallies where they're wearing Plan of San Diego shirts, and I went and found out what Plan of San Diego means.
[00:48:07.414 --> 00:48:11.936]  I didn't know because this guy was sitting there going, you'll get this.
[00:48:11.996 --> 00:48:13.157]  And I was like, I get what?
[00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.371]  And people said, you don't know what that means?
[00:48:15.771 --> 00:48:17.052]  That's the means he wants to kill you.
[00:48:18.032 --> 00:48:18.972]  Well, I mean, there it is!
[00:48:20.953 --> 00:48:21.953]  There it is right there!
[00:48:24.314 --> 00:48:26.594]  Meanwhile, they infiltrate Hattari for years.
[00:48:26.894 --> 00:48:37.377]  They have other militias run by feds, we told you this day one, that were the ones tattling on them, lying about them, doing all of this, and boom, there you have it.
[00:48:37.817 --> 00:48:38.877]  Now, why did the judge do this?
[00:48:38.917 --> 00:48:40.998]  Because there was no evidence they were planning violence.
[00:48:41.278 --> 00:48:42.118]  It was all made up.
[00:48:44.517 --> 00:48:47.559]  Defense lawyers say it was just a case of irrational, hateful speech.
[00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:54.404]  So they're now going to release them pending trial.
[00:48:54.764 --> 00:48:59.287]  Militia accused of trying to plot war against the government can be released from jail on bond.
[00:49:00.268 --> 00:49:07.433]  Or it could be that the feds know they have so little evidence that they want to release them hoping one of them does something wrong.
[00:49:08.919 --> 00:49:10.080]  Man, we have got to listen.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:15.846]  For anybody in Michigan, I need to talk to those Hitari people as soon as they get out.
[00:49:16.426 --> 00:49:24.694]  And I need to talk to them, because they're going to be told not to talk, and find out who exactly was the FBI agent and informant in their group of nine.
[00:49:25.114 --> 00:49:29.518]  That means only seven of these people were really even militia.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:35.005]  And the media spun it like they were planning to take over four counties to be their own country.
[00:49:35.386 --> 00:49:37.970]  Then it got released in court documents.
[00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:45.039]  They said, if America collapses, we'll work with local police and others to form a four-county area for the defense.
[00:49:46.038 --> 00:49:50.479]  Because all these other towns are going bankrupt and they're laying off as much as half of their police forces.
[00:49:50.959 --> 00:49:54.100]  We better set up some kind of police force when things collapse.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:58.661]  Oh, that turns into he wanted to be a king and have his own country.
[00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:01.822]  Oh, we saw headlines about how one of them killed their cat.
[00:50:02.782 --> 00:50:05.442]  No, it turned out the cat had cancer and was dying.
[00:50:05.842 --> 00:50:10.423]  And a lot of people in the country, for those that don't know, don't take their animal in to be lethally injected.
[00:50:11.204 --> 00:50:12.564]  They just take them out back and shoot them.
[00:50:14.005 --> 00:50:16.286]  But again, people think it's brutal to kill a chicken and eat it.
[00:50:16.306 --> 00:50:17.526]  Where do you think chickens come from?
[00:50:18.087 --> 00:50:19.407]  That's what people do in rural areas.
[00:50:21.068 --> 00:50:24.649]  You know, if any of the Hattari owned chickens, they'd say, they murdered chickens for fun.
[00:50:25.089 --> 00:50:26.670]  No, they butchered chickens for food.
[00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.611]  You see, that's the same way they manipulate everything.
[00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:31.072]  So that's breaking news there.
[00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:33.352]  Let's go ahead and get Greg Palast on the line.
[00:50:33.653 --> 00:50:35.173]  Then I'm gonna get into all this other news.
[00:50:35.233 --> 00:50:37.254]  But the banking takeover, when we get back.
[00:50:37.274 --> 00:50:42.436]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:49.006]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:49.026 --> 00:50:50.127]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:50.147 --> 00:50:55.511]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:50:55.731 --> 00:51:00.375]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:00.755 --> 00:51:05.800]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:11.023]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:11.544 --> 00:51:13.485]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:51:13.865 --> 00:51:18.468]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:18.668 --> 00:51:19.569]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:22.551]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:26.153]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:26.474 --> 00:51:29.315]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:51:29.656 --> 00:51:31.557]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:51:31.897 --> 00:51:32.818]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:40.162]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:40.682 --> 00:51:45.185]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:45.505 --> 00:51:47.966]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:51.868 --> 00:51:53.789]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:57.111]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:03.535 --> 00:52:04.115]  Big Brother.
[00:52:04.836 --> 00:52:05.856]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:06.596 --> 00:52:07.697]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:08.357 --> 00:52:09.177]  You want answers?
[00:52:09.937 --> 00:52:10.897]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:11.478 --> 00:52:15.138]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:15.678 --> 00:52:19.779]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.800]  The last year and a half I've been trying to get back in shape.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.021]  After years of not working out, I tell you, it is rough.
[00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:29.359]  Jogged this morning.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.541]  Went out to the lake Saturday.
[00:52:31.601 --> 00:52:34.182]  Swam a little over 1,000 yards.
[00:52:35.362 --> 00:52:42.386]  That isn't a lot for a good swimmer, but for me, 1,000 yards, that's... I pulled something in my neck.
[00:52:42.686 --> 00:52:47.629]  So the whole time I'm on TV today, I may be wincing with the pain.
[00:52:48.369 --> 00:52:52.351]  Just thought I'd mention that because they cut to me early and I was like all contorted in pain.
[00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:53.431]  That's not your fault.
[00:52:53.652 --> 00:52:55.232]  Hey, I got Advil.
[00:52:55.312 --> 00:52:56.173]  I'm taking more Advil.
[00:52:57.449 --> 00:52:58.129]  That's what it takes.
[00:52:58.149 --> 00:52:58.890]  I don't have any water.
[00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:01.851]  That's what it takes to get back in shape.
[00:53:01.951 --> 00:53:02.971]  No pain, no gain.
[00:53:04.091 --> 00:53:06.692]  And, uh, I seem a little bit out of it today.
[00:53:06.732 --> 00:53:07.473]  That's what's going on.
[00:53:09.113 --> 00:53:12.275]  Okay, um, excuse me just a moment.
[00:53:12.295 --> 00:53:19.137]  I've got like this charley horse right in your neck, right where it meets your, uh, I guess that's your trap right there.
[00:53:21.878 --> 00:53:24.819]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, getting my composure there from a muscle spasm.
[00:53:27.045 --> 00:53:31.286]  It was easy swimming 1,000 yards, but it's the soreness of my back now.
[00:53:31.306 --> 00:53:32.606]  I mean, how out of shape?
[00:53:33.087 --> 00:53:33.727]  You swim 1,000 yards.
[00:53:33.747 --> 00:53:35.687]  I don't know, how many laps is that in an Olympic pool?
[00:53:35.707 --> 00:53:36.768]  I don't know.
[00:53:38.328 --> 00:53:39.328]  What is 1,000 yards?
[00:53:39.348 --> 00:53:40.328]  How much of a mile is that?
[00:53:40.368 --> 00:53:42.789]  Is that like three-quarters of a mile?
[00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:46.550]  Now do me a calculation.
[00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:47.550]  What's 1,000 yards?
[00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:51.131]  It's one kilometer.
[00:53:52.572 --> 00:53:53.192]  We'll figure it out.
[00:53:53.212 --> 00:53:53.752]  It doesn't matter.
[00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:57.751]  Why am I off talking about swimming a kilometer?
[00:53:59.431 --> 00:54:03.732]  Okay, we'll figure it out.
[00:54:03.772 --> 00:54:04.132]  Thank you.
[00:54:08.693 --> 00:54:12.453]  All right, let me get refocused here on the news we're covering.
[00:54:13.114 --> 00:54:14.174]  I looked at my sheet wrong.
[00:54:14.194 --> 00:54:16.974]  Greg Palast is coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:54:18.495 --> 00:54:20.595]  And I am still just reeling
[00:54:22.769 --> 00:54:33.296]  from the fact that illegal aliens rioted all over the United States, set fire to buildings and knocked out more than 20 shop windows in Santa Cruz.
[00:54:33.936 --> 00:54:37.779]  They're running around with signs all over the news saying they're going to kill citizens, kill police.
[00:54:38.119 --> 00:54:39.861]  We've played audio, video of that.
[00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:40.961]  We've shown you the signs.
[00:54:41.582 --> 00:54:42.823]  It's just making my head spin.
[00:54:45.435 --> 00:55:02.747]  When Greg Palast joins us after I take some calls, I'm going to get into Greece gets $146 billion bailout rescue in EU IMF package and how that dovetails in with ECB President, European Central Bank President favors global governance.
[00:55:03.387 --> 00:55:04.107]  That's Forbes.
[00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:05.729]  And there's another one.
[00:55:05.989 --> 00:55:09.251]  For nations living the good life, the party's over, IMF says.
[00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:12.793]  See, the bankers say your good life is over.
[00:55:13.254 --> 00:55:15.115]  And they're selling you that it's your fault.
[00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:22.564]  Also, Greece erupts as men from IMF prepare to wield an axe and take their pension funds.
[00:55:23.004 --> 00:55:24.566]  The Times of London.
[00:55:24.986 --> 00:55:31.153]  And I heard CNN yesterday explaining how Greece deserves to have their pension funds taken and how they're the bad guys.
[00:55:31.774 --> 00:55:36.680]  Sure, the governments have been bought off, the public have made bad decisions, but
[00:55:38.459 --> 00:55:39.740]  Ninety-five percent.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.100]  We've had economists on that agree.
[00:55:42.101 --> 00:55:45.802]  What happened here with the mortgage crisis wasn't mortgage crisis.
[00:55:45.882 --> 00:55:47.063]  It was derivatives, period.
[00:55:47.403 --> 00:55:58.307]  The media just claimed, oh my gosh, we've got a big housing crisis, we've got a big problem, we've got to have trillions of dollars right now on October 3rd or we're going to have a depression.
[00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:03.930]  And then October 4th, Henry Paulson, former Goldman Sachs head, he was Treasury Secretary at the time,
[00:56:05.129 --> 00:56:14.173]  said we're not going to tell you where the money's going now and it's not going to unfreeze the mortgage market and the mortgage market is more frozen now than it was then.
[00:56:15.414 --> 00:56:32.942]  Someone explain how this scam works in detail and then coming up the next hour, and you guys make me do this, remind me, because we did a lot of work, you did a lot of work, getting clips out of Obama's commencement speech in Michigan and his White House press corps dinner where he just went over the top
[00:56:34.247 --> 00:56:40.333]  Over-the-top with arrogance and in-your-face bravado, chutzpah, whatever you want to call it, hubris.
[00:56:41.915 --> 00:56:45.178]  That is coming up in the last hour amongst a lot of other important news.
[00:56:46.719 --> 00:56:49.282]  But your phone calls are coming up.
[00:56:50.343 --> 00:56:55.147]  Then I'm going to get into this Orwellian IRS ad that's running.
[00:56:55.167 --> 00:56:55.568]  Stay with us.
[00:56:58.823 --> 00:57:01.126]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:57:01.146 --> 00:57:03.429]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:57:03.529 --> 00:57:06.293]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:57:06.734 --> 00:57:11.500]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:16.046]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:57:16.346 --> 00:57:18.707]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:57:18.807 --> 00:57:21.228]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:57:21.588 --> 00:57:24.129]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:32.093]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:57:32.443 --> 00:57:37.726]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:57:37.826 --> 00:57:40.108]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:57:40.148 --> 00:57:44.130]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:45.271]  And I got news for you.
[00:57:45.431 --> 00:57:46.712]  You're everyone else.
[00:57:46.772 --> 00:57:47.893]  Invisible Empire.

[00:58:58.956 --> 00:59:01.559]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.927]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:07.287 --> 00:59:09.029]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:14.176]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:14.356 --> 00:59:15.318]  How much do you want?
[00:59:15.538 --> 00:59:16.259]  When do you want it?
[00:59:16.639 --> 00:59:18.241]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:19.342]  When will you need it?
[00:59:19.602 --> 00:59:21.664]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:21.804 --> 00:59:22.905]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:23.146 --> 00:59:24.467]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:24.667 --> 00:59:29.732]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:33.076]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:33.516 --> 00:59:37.019]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.321]  How much will you need?
[00:59:38.561 --> 00:59:39.181]  We don't know.
[00:59:39.462 --> 00:59:40.382]  How much do you want?
[00:59:40.563 --> 00:59:41.303]  All you can get.
[00:59:41.504 --> 00:59:42.344]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:42.605 --> 00:59:45.347]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:45.647 --> 00:59:47.389]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:47.409 --> 00:59:48.350]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:06.667]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.268 --> 01:00:10.332]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.454 --> 01:00:13.777]  Okay, I'm gonna go back to your calls here in a few minutes.
[01:00:15.848 --> 01:00:34.442]  Then I am going to be interviewing for 30 minutes Greg Powless of the BBC, who eight years ago exposed the derivative scam operation that Enron and Goldman Sachs and others had already set up, and how they were planning to bring down the Western world, just as they had brought down countless third world countries.
[01:00:34.462 --> 01:00:39.566]  He got the internal IMF World Bank documents, so we thought it'd be a good time to have Greg Powless back.
[01:00:40.518 --> 01:00:40.778]  Okay.
[01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:44.300]  Everything the government does is about intimidation.
[01:00:44.881 --> 01:01:00.631]  And setting up the system where the government's our mommy, our daddy, our big brother, with the billboards, with the fear, with the TV ads about tattling on your parents, tattling on your neighbors, terrorists are under every table.
[01:01:01.513 --> 01:01:02.594]  They're going to get you.
[01:01:03.094 --> 01:01:05.296]  We're taking your rights away to keep you safe.
[01:01:05.736 --> 01:01:10.780]  So the message is we're going to protect you, but we're also going to take your guns so you can't protect yourself.
[01:01:12.137 --> 01:01:29.682]  And we want to intimidate you with the cameras and the surveillance and the tea parties with riot police and sound cannons at the events and the media claiming anybody that's against the banking takeover or open borders is a terrorist and the media covering up illegal aliens rioting nationwide.
[01:01:30.602 --> 01:01:33.883]  And remember this article from Fox News two years ago.
[01:01:34.283 --> 01:01:39.245]  Massachusetts police get black uniforms to instill sense of fear.
[01:01:41.403 --> 01:01:43.884]  Springfield's men in black are returning.
[01:01:44.305 --> 01:01:54.350]  The city's new police commissioner, William Fichette, says members of the department's street crime unit will again don black military-style uniforms as part of his strategy to deal with youth violence.
[01:01:55.010 --> 01:02:03.415]  And he went on to say, quote, this is, he says, this is the sense of fear has been missing for the past few years.
[01:02:04.315 --> 01:02:07.537]  Said Sergeant Don Delaney told the City Council hearing.
[01:02:08.138 --> 01:02:09.819]  So it's all about fear.
[01:02:10.299 --> 01:02:14.962]  And then every time we point out the government is terrorizing the public, trying to make us scared.
[01:02:15.943 --> 01:02:22.587]  And Obama said in a speech we're going to play next hour, that when you criticize the government, you're criticizing the American people.
[01:02:22.647 --> 01:02:24.828]  The people are the government in a democracy.
[01:02:25.189 --> 01:02:25.669]  No they're not.
[01:02:25.929 --> 01:02:26.750]  We're a republic.
[01:02:27.554 --> 01:02:37.522]  Where if 51% say rob the other 49, you can't because everyone's rights to private property and free speech and the right of defense are protected.
[01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:48.370]  And so when Obama says, oh, the birds are tweeting, the sun's out, it's a beautiful day, the world didn't end when I signed Obamacare.
[01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:52.473]  He knows full well it doesn't get phased in until the next two to five years.
[01:02:52.733 --> 01:02:54.155]  It starts getting phased in in two years.
[01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:55.791]  More deception.
[01:02:56.552 --> 01:03:00.794]  So he comes out and says something similar, very deceptive, using psych warfare.
[01:03:01.474 --> 01:03:03.175]  He comes out and says, you are the government.
[01:03:03.395 --> 01:03:05.637]  So when you criticize the government, you criticize the people.
[01:03:06.017 --> 01:03:06.277]  Really?
[01:03:06.677 --> 01:03:10.699]  Is the government, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others being the biggest contributors to both parties?
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.541]  Offshore banks stealing trillions from us?
[01:03:14.481 --> 01:03:18.604]  That'd be like the Greece government saying, you know, don't criticize the banks, they're your government.
[01:03:18.904 --> 01:03:21.005]  You know, they represent you, this is democracy.
[01:03:23.188 --> 01:03:27.952]  By the way, the Greeks did create democracy, what, 2600 years ago.
[01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:32.895]  They had a bucket for black stones and a bucket for white stones.
[01:03:33.336 --> 01:03:40.341]  And only the land, the landed, wealthy, gentry class was allowed to vote.
[01:03:40.581 --> 01:03:48.207]  A. B, they would have votes almost every day, and sometimes they would have a vote on, are we going to kill this philosopher?
[01:03:49.687 --> 01:03:51.288]  Who's been criticizing the government?
[01:03:51.648 --> 01:03:53.969]  And they would go have a vote, and they'd say, yes, we're going to kill him.
[01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:56.771]  And so they would grab him and throw him off a cliff.
[01:03:57.091 --> 01:03:58.232]  Many famous cases of that.
[01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:01.453]  Their favorite way to kill someone was to throw them off a 700-foot cliff.
[01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:06.916]  That's how they did it.
[01:04:07.016 --> 01:04:10.758]  Throwing people off, head first, you grab them by their arms and legs, four men, one
[01:04:12.617 --> 01:04:14.819]  One, two, three!
[01:04:15.659 --> 01:04:16.960]  I'm not for democracy.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.501]  I'm against democracy.
[01:04:18.762 --> 01:04:20.583]  I'm sick of hearing about democracy.
[01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:28.689]  In a democracy, they can bring in 51% foreigners from China and Germany and Europe and Mexico and everywhere else.
[01:04:29.489 --> 01:04:30.450]  They can bring them in.
[01:04:31.011 --> 01:04:36.875]  The government promises them in a political party some chicken feed goodies if they'll vote for big government and tyranny.
[01:04:37.095 --> 01:04:40.618]  They vote for it and they say, hey, 51% voted to take your guns.
[01:04:42.742 --> 01:04:45.924]  You notice, though, the government likes democracy when it goes their way.
[01:04:46.284 --> 01:04:53.407]  But when 65 to 70 percent of Americans are against abortion now, they say, oh, well, we're a republic.
[01:04:53.767 --> 01:04:56.489]  Does it matter if 99 percent of you are against abortion?
[01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:59.070]  People can still do what they want with their body.
[01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:00.290]  But that's another case.
[01:05:01.011 --> 01:05:05.613]  In a republic, everyone's rights are protected, including that baby that can't speak for itself.
[01:05:05.813 --> 01:05:07.494]  But that's a twisting of the republic.
[01:05:07.754 --> 01:05:10.455]  So, see, they want to play it both ways here.
[01:05:10.855 --> 01:05:11.756]  Now, that said,
[01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:17.640]  We have seen massive, sustained intimidation of the people all over the country.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:26.675]  The police admit we wear black uniforms, we wear black masks, we beat on our shields with billy clubs, we bring sound cannons out to the tea parties to intimidate you.
[01:05:27.952 --> 01:05:30.254]  Because we want to intimidate you.
[01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:43.563]  That's why they bring riot police to any pro-America demonstration, whether it's anti-war, that's pro-sovereignty, that's good, or whether it's pro-border control, or whether it's pro-Second Amendment, or pro-land rights.
[01:05:43.924 --> 01:05:53.391]  If the globalists don't like it, they don't want demonstrations to spread, they don't want the idea to spread, they want to keep... In fact, pull up that ants clip again.
[01:05:54.275 --> 01:05:55.535]  Well, we never played that last week.
[01:05:55.555 --> 01:05:57.856]  If you let one ant stand up, they'll all stand up.
[01:05:57.876 --> 01:05:58.376]  Do we have that?
[01:06:01.517 --> 01:06:03.638]  Okay, yeah, I think you were actually gone.
[01:06:03.658 --> 01:06:05.118]  Yeah, no, we have the clip.
[01:06:05.158 --> 01:06:06.239]  We'll cue that up.
[01:06:06.279 --> 01:06:07.199]  In fact, John has it.
[01:06:07.599 --> 01:06:08.999]  John, you have that at the network, don't you?
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.140]  You couldn't find it either.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.561]  Okay, well, we'll have to go buy it then.
[01:06:14.581 --> 01:06:23.644]  The point is, it's about a ten second clip, the issue is, you've got the grasshoppers all standing around, and they're in this big granary,
[01:06:24.932 --> 01:06:36.983]  totally stuffed, gobbling, and the second-in-command aid-to-camp grasshopper comes shuffling over to the boss grasshopper, and he says, why are we fighting with these ants?
[01:06:37.043 --> 01:06:38.384]  We don't need them to work for us.
[01:06:38.644 --> 01:06:39.785]  We got plenty of food here.
[01:06:40.646 --> 01:06:49.754]  And the head grasshopper says, those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one, and if they ever figure that out, it's over for us.
[01:06:50.993 --> 01:06:52.893]  It's not about food, it's about power.
[01:06:52.933 --> 01:06:54.734]  It's about letting them know we're in charge.
[01:06:55.154 --> 01:06:55.674]  And here it is.
[01:06:55.754 --> 01:07:00.095]  Massachusetts police get black uniforms to instill a sense of fear.
[01:07:00.955 --> 01:07:02.255]  Now that's what this is all about.
[01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:12.797]  And the video we're about to play that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com Orwellian Big Brother tax collection commercial airs in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:16.998]  And there are so many facets to this.
[01:07:17.078 --> 01:07:19.479]  I even wrote some notes last night that I want to go over here.
[01:07:20.455 --> 01:07:27.478]  There are so many levels to this, but let's play the 30 second ad first, and then go over what the message here.
[01:07:27.719 --> 01:07:36.423]  The message is, we're watching you from satellite, we're God, we know who you are, we're going to drive you into bankruptcy, we're never going to stop,
[01:07:37.043 --> 01:07:40.845]  And we're going to say it with a calm, authoritative, arrogant voice.
[01:07:40.945 --> 01:07:42.146]  Nice car, Tom.
[01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:43.787]  Nice house, Tom.
[01:07:44.087 --> 01:07:46.328]  What's not nice is you not paying.
[01:07:46.668 --> 01:07:47.809]  You're not nice, Tom.
[01:07:48.129 --> 01:07:49.170]  You're the enemy, Tom.
[01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:55.753]  This is meant to scare the public and to brainwash government employees more and more as an us-against-them mentality.
[01:07:56.234 --> 01:07:56.994]  This is right out of 1984.
[01:07:57.034 --> 01:07:57.414]  Here it is.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.980]  Your name is Tom.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.001]  You live just off of 5th Street.
[01:08:02.201 --> 01:08:03.181]  Nice car, Tom.
[01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:04.161]  Nice house.
[01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:10.403]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[01:08:11.043 --> 01:08:11.763]  Listen, Tom.
[01:08:12.203 --> 01:08:13.304]  We can make this easy.
[01:08:13.804 --> 01:08:19.345]  Pay online by June 18th and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[01:08:20.245 --> 01:08:23.626]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[01:08:26.247 --> 01:08:27.387]  Find us before we find you.
[01:08:29.602 --> 01:08:30.563]  That's what the mafia does.
[01:08:30.603 --> 01:08:36.887]  They come up and say, nice cleaners, nice furniture store, nice family grocery store.
[01:08:37.308 --> 01:08:38.629]  We'll make this easy for you, Tom.
[01:08:39.329 --> 01:08:41.491]  Pay us and we won't burn your grocery store down.
[01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:49.517]  And now you have the Greek people being told you are going to have to pay
[01:08:50.888 --> 01:08:53.390]  At least half of your pension fund money to begin with.
[01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:55.132]  We're going to make this easy on you, Grace.
[01:08:55.593 --> 01:09:02.039]  Only half your money has to be paid to JPMorgan, Chase, and Goldman Sachs that run your country as their finance minister.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:04.561]  You don't owe the money.
[01:09:05.021 --> 01:09:05.862]  It's pure derivatives.
[01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:06.503]  It's made up.
[01:09:06.903 --> 01:09:07.804]  Came out on Iceland.
[01:09:07.824 --> 01:09:08.505]  They said no.
[01:09:08.785 --> 01:09:10.987]  Turned out it was totally fraudulent.
[01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:12.569]  Same thing here in the U.S.
[01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:15.531]  We're going to be easy on you, Tom.
[01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:21.131]  You know, Tom, we already poisoned your water with fluoride that doubles your chances of bone cancer and brain damage.
[01:09:21.551 --> 01:09:25.351]  You know, Tom, we're already pushing mandatory vaccinations filled with mercury, Tom.
[01:09:26.052 --> 01:09:29.932]  You know, Tom, we're watching you with all these cameras and satellites, Tom.
[01:09:30.452 --> 01:09:31.633]  You know, we're omnipresent.
[01:09:31.673 --> 01:09:32.653]  We're God, Tom.
[01:09:32.933 --> 01:09:33.793]  We're the board.
[01:09:34.073 --> 01:09:35.173]  We're the hive mind.
[01:09:35.493 --> 01:09:36.613]  We own you, Tom.
[01:09:37.013 --> 01:09:38.734]  You need to submit to us, Tom.
[01:09:39.114 --> 01:09:40.954]  You need to do what you're told, Tom.
[01:09:42.634 --> 01:09:45.515]  Play that sickening 30-second clip.
[01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.079]  Oh, we now have the ants clip.
[01:09:48.119 --> 01:09:48.560]  That's fine.
[01:09:49.141 --> 01:09:50.764]  Let's go ahead and play the ants clip.
[01:09:50.784 --> 01:09:51.104]  Here it is.
[01:09:53.874 --> 01:09:56.755]  But there was that ant that stood up to me.
[01:09:56.996 --> 01:09:58.876]  Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[01:09:58.956 --> 01:10:01.058]  Yeah, it was just one ant.
[01:10:01.158 --> 01:10:02.878]  Ooh, one ant.
[01:10:03.018 --> 01:10:04.539]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:10:04.859 --> 01:10:07.060]  It's just one ant.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:07.981]  Yeah, boss.
[01:10:08.021 --> 01:10:09.181]  They're puny.
[01:10:09.502 --> 01:10:10.702]  Hmm, puny?
[01:10:11.363 --> 01:10:15.705]  Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant.
[01:10:16.665 --> 01:10:17.285]  Did that hurt?
[01:10:17.305 --> 01:10:18.906]  Nope.
[01:10:18.946 --> 01:10:20.187]  Well, how about this one?
[01:10:21.007 --> 01:10:21.868]  Are you kidding?
[01:10:23.323 --> 01:10:24.608]  Well, how about this?
[01:10:37.222 --> 01:10:42.384]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:10:43.104 --> 01:10:47.425]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:10:47.885 --> 01:10:51.747]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[01:10:52.547 --> 01:10:53.787]  It's not about food.
[01:10:54.467 --> 01:10:57.088]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:10:57.808 --> 01:10:59.329]  That's why we're going back!
[01:11:00.669 --> 01:11:02.350]  Does anybody else want to stay?
[01:11:13.137 --> 01:11:13.737]  And that's it.
[01:11:13.958 --> 01:11:14.798]  That's government.
[01:11:15.599 --> 01:11:17.680]  That's what the Founding Fathers warned us about.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.681]  That's what's happened to every other civilization.
[01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:26.426]  And now the average American pays more than 60% of their earnings in one form of taxation or another.
[01:11:27.386 --> 01:11:31.589]  And they've got the head grasshopper, the head of the European Central Bank,
[01:11:33.605 --> 01:11:42.211]  In the Washington Post, it says, for nations living the good life, the party is over, IMF chief says.
[01:11:42.892 --> 01:11:50.437]  And on the same board, the head of the European Central Bank says, global government is going to be set up to keep us in line.
[01:11:51.318 --> 01:11:52.318]  You hear that, Tom?
[01:11:52.799 --> 01:11:53.839]  We own you, Tom.
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:55.581]  You're our slave, Tom.
[01:11:55.601 --> 01:11:57.202]  Do you understand, Tom?
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.841]  Global meltdowns.
[01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:02.221]  Massive unemployment.
[01:12:02.602 --> 01:12:03.382]  Endless wars.
[01:12:03.822 --> 01:12:05.063]  A new currency crisis.
[01:12:05.463 --> 01:12:07.204]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[01:12:07.544 --> 01:12:09.406]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[01:12:09.706 --> 01:12:11.327]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[01:12:11.607 --> 01:12:13.308]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[01:12:13.688 --> 01:12:15.269]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:21.813]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[01:12:22.153 --> 01:12:27.097]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[01:12:27.417 --> 01:12:39.407]  Off-the-Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance, and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold, and guns.
[01:12:39.707 --> 01:12:41.509]  With absolutely no apologies.
[01:12:41.849 --> 01:12:42.510]  And the best part?

[01:12:46.736 --> 01:12:50.742]  That's right, free for our listeners who sign up at OffTheGridNews.com.
[01:12:50.983 --> 01:12:52.665]  That's OffTheGridNews.com.

[01:12:59.266 --> 01:13:02.547]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[01:13:02.787 --> 01:13:07.949]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:13.551]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:15.772]  The value of the U.S.
[01:13:15.812 --> 01:13:17.733]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:20.934]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals.
[01:13:21.094 --> 01:13:22.334]  But you need to act today.
[01:13:22.615 --> 01:13:31.577]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we can explore how MIDAS resources can help you secure your financial future.
[01:13:31.757 --> 01:13:36.379]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren,
[01:13:36.619 --> 01:13:40.001]  There's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[01:13:40.242 --> 01:13:51.309]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.
[01:13:51.329 --> 01:13:58.594]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a lifetime to establish.
[01:14:01.298 --> 01:14:02.999]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:14:03.799 --> 01:14:04.720]  Tyranny is here.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:08.722]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:14:08.782 --> 01:14:11.203]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:14:11.223 --> 01:14:16.666]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:14:17.087 --> 01:14:23.330]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:29.294]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:14:29.694 --> 01:14:33.396]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:14:33.916 --> 01:14:37.939]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:14:38.199 --> 01:14:43.723]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:14:44.143 --> 01:14:47.145]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:14:47.705 --> 01:14:49.086]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:14:49.647 --> 01:14:50.108]  It's here.

[01:14:59.085 --> 01:14:59.626]  You worry.
[01:15:00.006 --> 01:15:01.748]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:15:02.048 --> 01:15:04.271]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:15:04.591 --> 01:15:06.413]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:15:06.674 --> 01:15:07.875]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:15:08.275 --> 01:15:11.399]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:15:11.779 --> 01:15:16.645]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:15:17.025 --> 01:15:20.329]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:15:20.809 --> 01:15:22.149]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:25.090]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:28.311]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:15:28.651 --> 01:15:36.813]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:15:37.093 --> 01:15:41.495]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:15:41.775 --> 01:15:45.476]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[01:15:45.796 --> 01:15:49.177]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at
[01:15:58.433 --> 01:15:59.513]  Your name is Tom.
[01:15:59.733 --> 01:16:01.554]  You live just off of 5th Street.
[01:16:01.754 --> 01:16:02.714]  Nice car, Tom.
[01:16:02.994 --> 01:16:03.715]  Nice house.
[01:16:03.915 --> 01:16:09.957]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[01:16:10.577 --> 01:16:11.297]  Listen, Tom.
[01:16:11.757 --> 01:16:12.858]  We can make this easy.
[01:16:13.378 --> 01:16:18.880]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.121]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[01:16:27.861 --> 01:16:29.302]  We know who you are, Tom.
[01:16:30.022 --> 01:16:36.544]  The illegal aliens are above the law, don't have to pay taxes, get all the free welfare, because we're bringing them in here as a voting block.
[01:16:37.024 --> 01:16:38.005]  You're the enemy, Tom.
[01:16:38.025 --> 01:16:41.266]  We're running an offshore military banking operation against you.
[01:16:41.546 --> 01:16:42.506]  We run your country.
[01:16:42.786 --> 01:16:44.667]  You're not living in a free nation anymore, Tom.
[01:16:45.027 --> 01:16:49.629]  We're watching you with satellites and tracking systems with your own money.
[01:16:50.829 --> 01:16:52.450]  We're going to bankrupt you, Tom.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.481]  You understand, Tom?
[01:16:54.501 --> 01:16:55.442]  You got a nice house.
[01:16:55.482 --> 01:16:56.382]  You got a nice car.
[01:16:56.823 --> 01:16:57.783]  That's one step away from you.
[01:16:57.803 --> 01:16:58.804]  You got nice kids.
[01:16:59.245 --> 01:17:00.786]  Hope nothing happens to them, Tom.
[01:17:02.968 --> 01:17:04.129]  That's the intimidation.
[01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:07.532]  That's the type of mind control and bullying we have.
[01:17:08.012 --> 01:17:08.913]  And the sky's the limit.
[01:17:08.933 --> 01:17:10.895]  Have you seen the armed camp the government's become?
[01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:18.241]  They run Fox News pieces now admitting our government's growing the opium in Afghanistan, but they're going to arrest you if you get caught with it.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.802]  Of course they gotta keep it illegal to keep the price up!
[01:17:22.302 --> 01:17:23.303]  They're drug dealers!
[01:17:23.963 --> 01:17:26.645]  How many drug dealers did we interview for Kevin Booth's new film?
[01:17:27.066 --> 01:17:28.347]  Part 2 of American Drug War.
[01:17:28.927 --> 01:17:29.708]  We'd won the West.
[01:17:30.028 --> 01:17:33.971]  The drug dealers, both government and local, don't want drugs decriminalized.
[01:17:34.912 --> 01:17:36.413]  Because they're drug dealers, Tom.
[01:17:37.373 --> 01:17:41.777]  Tom is the new Winston Smith in this Orwellian system.
[01:17:41.817 --> 01:17:43.318]  And that's the government's mentality.
[01:17:43.718 --> 01:17:44.459]  Intimidate them.
[01:17:44.819 --> 01:17:45.920]  Drive them into submission.
[01:17:47.230 --> 01:18:05.800]  I don't know how many people I know that have degrees who lost their job at a nice company and now bag groceries and even pick up another job and have moved into a smaller house and can't pay for anything and they can't pay, I mean a small house in Austin has like a $5,000 a year property tax.
[01:18:09.537 --> 01:18:11.298]  And I heard him announce last week where I live.
[01:18:11.858 --> 01:18:15.480]  Well, it doesn't matter if property tax receipts are down because home values are down.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.800]  We're just going to raise them.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.522]  And we don't care if we're going to double in the next three years your power bill.
[01:18:22.123 --> 01:18:26.705]  And we're just going to keep expanding and taking the money through the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[01:18:27.185 --> 01:18:28.886]  And we're going to invest it with the big banks.
[01:18:29.646 --> 01:18:30.746]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:18:30.786 --> 01:18:31.587]  Do you understand?
[01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:37.149]  As the arrogant head of the IMF came out and said, the good times are over.
[01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:38.590]  You're going to be poor now.
[01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:41.051]  And we want you to lose your house, Tom.
[01:18:41.272 --> 01:18:42.272]  We want the government.
[01:18:42.932 --> 01:18:44.473]  I'll never forget Nelda Wells Spears.
[01:18:44.493 --> 01:18:45.414]  This was a decade ago.
[01:18:45.434 --> 01:18:49.876]  Mike Hanson ought to find that video from our AXS TV days and upload it to the web.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.245]  I think it's Alex Jones Confronts County Tax Assessor.
[01:18:54.586 --> 01:18:58.092]  And she says, Nelda Wells Spears, she says, we don't take houses!
[01:18:58.493 --> 01:19:04.083]  And then we cut to the courthouse, them selling houses, in some cases for $2,000 property tax bills they couldn't pay.
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.880]  And she says, we do not take homes.
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:08.421]  Then we cut to them taking the homes.
[01:19:08.681 --> 01:19:13.962]  And then we cut to her in Commissioner's Court a month before, talking about all the great houses they'd taken for sale.
[01:19:14.242 --> 01:19:15.222]  But that's their arrogance.
[01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:22.223]  She's talking to an enemy, a slave enemy, and she's gonna do nothing but sit there and stonewall and say, no.
[01:19:22.844 --> 01:19:24.044]  Hey, I don't want world government.
[01:19:24.084 --> 01:19:25.404]  I don't want trillions going to bankers.
[01:19:25.664 --> 01:19:26.724]  World government doesn't exist.
[01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:27.605]  Bankers don't exist.
[01:19:28.105 --> 01:19:29.065]  I don't want a new world order.
[01:19:29.085 --> 01:19:29.745]  It doesn't exist.
[01:19:30.045 --> 01:19:31.945]  I don't want them taking people's houses.
[01:19:31.985 --> 01:19:33.386]  We can't pay the taxes anymore.
[01:19:33.626 --> 01:19:34.546]  Government's too big.
[01:19:35.745 --> 01:19:36.946]  We're not taking houses.
[01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:38.588]  We're not.
[01:19:39.469 --> 01:19:41.531]  Nice car, nice house, Tom.
[01:19:42.492 --> 01:19:43.633]  Nice kids, Tom.
[01:19:46.316 --> 01:19:48.318]  I'm going to cover this more in the last hour if I have time.
[01:19:48.399 --> 01:19:49.299]  Greg Powell is coming up.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.842]  I need to go to your calls and a bunch of other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:19:51.882 --> 01:19:52.943]  We're doing a pretty good job today.
[01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:54.583]  Covering it all.
[01:19:54.863 --> 01:19:57.525]  But this is government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:19:57.546 --> 01:20:01.870]  This is psychological bullying and mafia terrorism against the people.
[01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:07.956]  Before we go to break, I just hope this outrages you like it outrages me and let the scum in government know that we're aware of what they're doing.
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:10.581]  And the illegal alien hordes that work for them.
[01:20:11.042 --> 01:20:15.646]  Before I go to break, I want to thank some of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[01:20:16.046 --> 01:20:18.048]  Number one is Pure Water Freedom.
[01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:24.813]  You talk about the best prices I've found on in-home and also off the shelf and on the counter.
[01:20:25.213 --> 01:20:25.854]  They've got it all.
[01:20:26.114 --> 01:20:27.575]  PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:20:28.236 --> 01:20:31.498]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit Pure Water
[01:20:32.259 --> 01:20:33.100]  Freedom.com.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.701]  It's PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:20:34.941 --> 01:20:36.922]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[01:20:37.223 --> 01:20:43.207]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole water fluoride system.
[01:20:43.247 --> 01:20:48.731]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water including shower and bath filters.
[01:20:49.331 --> 01:20:51.453]  All their filters are made in the USA.
[01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:57.037]  Check out their banners on PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:20:58.298 --> 01:21:00.399]  And then I want to thank another fabulous sponsor.
[01:21:00.479 --> 01:21:01.520]  You cannot trust
[01:21:02.878 --> 01:21:03.338]  We're good to go.
[01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:24.064]  I've got to tell you, there's a lot of bad folks out there selling food.
[01:21:24.425 --> 01:21:26.426]  efoodsdirect.com are wonderful people.
[01:21:26.666 --> 01:21:28.907]  E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[01:21:29.207 --> 01:21:36.631]  Or give them a call, ask for a free info brochure, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.

[01:21:39.832 --> 01:21:44.755]  You'll never stand in a bread line with the big fat government pimps over you if you have your own bread.
[01:21:44.935 --> 01:21:46.416]  We'll be right back with Greg Palast.
[01:21:46.436 --> 01:21:46.876]  Stay with us.
[01:21:49.249 --> 01:21:52.234]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:55.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.861 --> 01:22:07.984]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:22:08.344 --> 01:22:18.789]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:24.671]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:29.714]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:22:30.114 --> 01:22:38.840]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:49.007]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:22:49.307 --> 01:22:52.469]  That's www.silverlungs.com.

[01:22:58.532 --> 01:22:59.792]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:59.832 --> 01:23:05.173]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:10.055]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:23:10.435 --> 01:23:15.456]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:23:15.996 --> 01:23:20.699]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:23.161]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:28.144]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:23:28.344 --> 01:23:29.245]  And here's the best part.
[01:23:29.465 --> 01:23:32.227]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:23:32.527 --> 01:23:35.829]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:23:36.150 --> 01:23:38.991]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:23:39.352 --> 01:23:41.233]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:23:41.573 --> 01:23:42.494]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:23:46.456 --> 01:23:49.819]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:54.882]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:23:55.182 --> 01:23:57.644]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:23:58.624 --> 01:24:04.068]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:24:05.269 --> 01:24:10.072]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:11.893]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:24:14.488 --> 01:24:17.210]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:24:19.131 --> 01:24:21.953]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:24:21.993 --> 01:24:25.155]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:24:27.632 --> 01:24:31.495]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:24:32.216 --> 01:24:35.338]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:24:36.059 --> 01:24:36.880]  Others don't.
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.161]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:40.923]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:24:41.223 --> 01:24:43.785]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:24:44.105 --> 01:24:50.371]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:24:50.731 --> 01:24:55.475]  Order yours at gusset.com Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:24:55.815 --> 01:24:56.676]  Others don't.
[01:25:09.522 --> 01:25:13.525]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play clips from two different Obama speeches.
[01:25:13.545 --> 01:25:21.690]  One at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, where he was extremely arrogant and made jokes about the private banking takeover of the United States.
[01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:35.826]  And another where he demonized the Tea Party folks, who have been bipartisan, but the Republicans are trying to take it over with the Tea Party Express, and said that basically you don't criticize the government in America because the government is the people.
[01:25:36.707 --> 01:25:37.368]  No, it's not.
[01:25:37.648 --> 01:25:39.130]  It's foreign offshore banks.
[01:25:39.651 --> 01:25:40.832]  The same people that own
[01:25:41.713 --> 01:25:44.097]  Barack Obama owned George W. Bush.
[01:25:44.117 --> 01:25:49.185]  Now the reason I got this fella on is because he's written multiple books and made films on the subject.
[01:25:49.766 --> 01:25:53.412]  He's worked for ABC News, the BBC, the list goes on and on.
[01:25:54.741 --> 01:25:55.942]  Palace stories bite.
[01:25:56.262 --> 01:25:58.884]  They're so relevant, they threaten to alter history.
[01:25:58.944 --> 01:26:01.325]  Palace is exactly what a journalist is supposed to be.
[01:26:02.085 --> 01:26:03.186]  A truth hound.
[01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:04.767]  Doggedly independent.
[01:26:05.487 --> 01:26:06.548]  Undaunted by power.
[01:26:07.269 --> 01:26:10.951]  And remember a few years ago, they issued a Homeland Security arrest warrant for him.
[01:26:11.211 --> 01:26:12.452]  That was on ABC News.
[01:26:12.912 --> 01:26:15.473]  Because he went and videotaped FEMA camps.
[01:26:16.474 --> 01:26:22.060]  Where they were holding the people from Katrina right next to a chemical plant that was belching toxic waste onto them.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.482]  And they said, that's global infrastructure.
[01:26:24.802 --> 01:26:26.724]  Under the Patriot Act, arrest him.
[01:26:27.084 --> 01:26:28.306]  But it blew up in their face.
[01:26:28.366 --> 01:26:31.229]  So, I mean, they've actually come after Greg Palast.
[01:26:31.249 --> 01:26:36.414]  But the main reason I got Greg Palast on today is because
[01:26:38.001 --> 01:26:41.482]  Back in 2002, Greg Palast got IMF World Bank documents.
[01:26:42.082 --> 01:26:51.804]  He came on my show and talked about them, but he reported on it to BBC, where the IMF and others engineer the collapse of societies, get them on debt on purpose.
[01:26:52.605 --> 01:26:57.986]  This predates the information with economic hitmen and John Perkins.
[01:26:59.286 --> 01:27:03.787]  And it showed the predatory nature, how they create riots on purpose, how they jack up prices.
[01:27:04.187 --> 01:27:06.208]  And now they're doing the same thing
[01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:13.492]  To the United States, and I have the Washington Post where the head of the IMF last week said, the good times are over.
[01:27:13.532 --> 01:27:14.073]  That's a quote.
[01:27:14.753 --> 01:27:16.054]  Everything's going to go to the bankers.
[01:27:16.094 --> 01:27:22.858]  And in Greece, I heard them on CNN yesterday, I have the Times of London, they were framing the Greeks as bad people.
[01:27:23.298 --> 01:27:27.561]  They get 85% on average for their pensions they pay into through the government.
[01:27:28.022 --> 01:27:30.063]  You know, the Germans only get 45%.
[01:27:30.123 --> 01:27:31.083]  The Germans are mad.
[01:27:31.284 --> 01:27:33.985]  So they're phrasing it as kind of like the housing bubble.
[01:27:34.145 --> 01:27:36.067]  Oh, it's the people that got the loans that are bad.
[01:27:36.587 --> 01:27:40.301]  And then right the day after the banker bailout, Bill,
[01:27:41.414 --> 01:27:42.375]  Glad to be back with you, Alec.
[01:28:11.509 --> 01:28:12.629]  So much is going on.
[01:28:12.869 --> 01:28:15.910]  Break down your take on what's currently happening and where you see it going.
[01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:20.551]  Well, I think that you've got to be pretty darn correct.
[01:28:20.691 --> 01:28:30.714]  I mean, number one, again, you'll see, just like they blame homeowners in America for subprime loans, predatory loans.
[01:28:32.014 --> 01:28:37.935]  You have to understand that most of the... We have a massive foreclosure problem in the United States.
[01:28:37.995 --> 01:28:40.056]  Two million families facing foreclosure.
[01:28:40.795 --> 01:28:44.959]  Which is more than we had when Obama took office and said he was going to fix it.
[01:28:45.279 --> 01:28:47.361]  He didn't put a moratorium on foreclosure.
[01:28:48.001 --> 01:28:49.462]  He didn't do either of those things.
[01:28:49.943 --> 01:28:51.744]  And there's more people in foreclosure than ever.
[01:28:51.764 --> 01:28:57.229]  When that happens the entire housing market remains in collapse.
[01:28:57.469 --> 01:29:00.532]  And they blame the victims of predatory lending.
[01:29:01.587 --> 01:29:02.147]  Very important.
[01:29:02.187 --> 01:29:03.688]  That's a system blaming the victims.
[01:29:03.809 --> 01:29:06.710]  In the case of Greece, they're blaming the people of Greece.
[01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:14.916]  How dare they want to collect their social security when they've been manipulated by the bankers because they're tied to the damn euro!
[01:29:16.057 --> 01:29:20.240]  Now, I've actually spoken to the father of the euro, the guy that came up with it, Robert Mundell.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:23.262]  He was the economist.
[01:29:23.302 --> 01:29:26.644]  By the way, his other invention besides the euro is supply-side economics.
[01:29:27.124 --> 01:29:29.326]  The kind of voodoo economics where, you know,
[01:29:30.345 --> 01:29:30.966]  I don't know.
[01:29:52.372 --> 01:29:52.632]  It's
[01:30:16.021 --> 01:30:18.143]  And that's the same thing with NAFTA and GATT.
[01:30:18.263 --> 01:30:19.324]  Ross Perot was right.
[01:30:19.724 --> 01:30:20.765]  The race to the bottom.
[01:30:20.805 --> 01:30:26.010]  And we got the SPP, North American Union documents, three years ago when Judicial Watch sued and got them.
[01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:30.834]  And they said they had all these corporate chiefs there at the governmental meeting
[01:30:31.394 --> 01:30:58.367]  Telling the Secretary of State of Mexico, Canada, and the United States what to do, and they said we're going to lower the US and Canada to the level of Mexico, just as we've done with the Euro, so there's nowhere to run, nowhere to compete, and now we're going to play nations off against each other all over the world, Asia, European Union, North American Union, to basically get all the tax money for bankers as bailouts.
[01:30:59.267 --> 01:31:08.332]  And take people's pension funds, and now we see Bloomberg reporting that federal regulators are preparing to take at least half of people's pensions in the U.S.
[01:31:10.113 --> 01:31:21.840]  Well, I think that what we're seeing, too, is that, you know, when Obama and Bush came up with the bailout, what they didn't do is what China did.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:27.243]  And China, they just said, if we're going to give money to the bank, they've got to re-lend the money.
[01:31:28.092 --> 01:31:34.314]  Remember that Obama made a claim that he saved the financial system.
[01:31:35.034 --> 01:31:35.574]  No he didn't.
[01:31:35.614 --> 01:31:43.636]  He saved the financiers and he doesn't seem to understand there's a difference between financiers who were bailed out and the financial system.
[01:31:43.816 --> 01:31:44.697]  Try to get a loan today.
[01:31:44.717 --> 01:31:46.077]  Try to get a mortgage today.
[01:31:46.519 --> 01:31:46.959]  You can't.
[01:31:47.319 --> 01:31:49.400]  If you're a small business, you can't borrow money today.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.540]  It's impossible.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.660]  No one will give you money.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:53.361]  There is no credit in the system.
[01:31:53.681 --> 01:31:58.942]  That's why we're on our knees, and that's why there is officially still nearly 10% unemployment.
[01:31:59.362 --> 01:32:01.543]  Forget the unofficial numbers.
[01:32:01.763 --> 01:32:06.384]  And because Obama never saved the financial system whatsoever.
[01:32:07.884 --> 01:32:11.225]  They kept them, which you'd have to have as capital in a capitalist system,
[01:32:11.912 --> 01:32:13.753]  And the money went to the banks and never came out.
[01:32:13.893 --> 01:32:18.795]  They swallowed it and it was gone, and bonuses and building up their own capital base.
[01:32:18.835 --> 01:32:19.956]  That's the big problem.
[01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:34.823]  So, whereas China grew 8% last year because they doubled the amount of credit in their economy, and so that people could buy up all of the junk that they were going to sell us at Walmart, the Chinese bought it for themselves because they're, you know, the bank, they're the bankers.
[01:32:34.903 --> 01:32:38.965]  If they don't give out the money, they execute them, which is a pretty good system of regulation, in my opinion.
[01:32:41.276 --> 01:32:44.301]  Let me boil that down and see if you agree.
[01:32:55.014 --> 01:32:57.174]  Paulson goes in and threatens martial law.
[01:32:57.294 --> 01:32:59.215]  I've had the congressman on who witnessed it.
[01:33:00.155 --> 01:33:07.017]  He says, there'll be blood in the streets, that's a quote, everything will collapse if you don't give us access to trillions of dollars in a blank check.
[01:33:07.657 --> 01:33:14.618]  October 3rd it passes, but before that they wouldn't pass it so they went, they had the bank heads go out and bad-mount the stock market.
[01:33:15.078 --> 01:33:17.739]  It went down by a record level.
[01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:23.040]  The Congress panicked, passed it, and then October 4th, on that Saturday, Paulson says,
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:26.001]  We're not going to spend it to unfreeze mortgages.
[01:33:26.561 --> 01:33:28.142]  We're not going to tell you where it went.
[01:33:28.382 --> 01:33:31.724]  So they had blamed the victims, and said it was these people's fault.
[01:33:32.304 --> 01:33:36.406]  And I guess in a way it was, they got suckered, but that was only a part of the derivative scheme.
[01:33:36.946 --> 01:33:43.570]  And then the money disappeared, and a year and a half later, both administrations, they won't say where the money went.
[01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:46.993]  We know they're flush with trillions of dollars of cash.
[01:33:47.193 --> 01:33:48.395]  They're lending less money.
[01:33:48.595 --> 01:33:53.340]  They've frozen Main Street, destroying Main Street, so they can come back in and buy it up.
[01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:59.346]  The same Goldman Sachs people went in and engineered the derivative system.
[01:33:59.386 --> 01:34:00.868]  They sold derivatives to Iceland.
[01:34:01.408 --> 01:34:07.691]  Now Greece is going under, and they're coming and getting $146 billion from Europe and the U.S.
[01:34:07.731 --> 01:34:17.036]  to go pay Goldman Sachs, and Greece will still be in the same situation they were, except now they're ordering Greece to give them at least half their pension fund money.
[01:34:17.836 --> 01:34:26.500]  Yes, and well, what's also happened, remember that the Federal Reserve has bought $1.25 trillion, let me say that again, trillion, $1.25 trillion,
[01:34:29.224 --> 01:34:32.166]  A mortgage-backed security that gambles on mortgages.
[01:34:32.907 --> 01:34:35.229]  Now, we have 2 million people in foreclosure.
[01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:37.270]  That's a trillion and a quarter.
[01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:46.377]  Instead of going to the banks to guarantee their best on these subprime mortgages, could have actually gone to and bought the mortgages from people at a discount to the banks.
[01:34:46.837 --> 01:34:47.738]  That's what Roosevelt did.
[01:34:47.778 --> 01:34:52.561]  Roosevelt set up in, in, uh, 33, the Federal Home Loan Bank.
[01:34:52.902 --> 01:34:57.445]  And he said to the- he ordered the banks to turn over their mortgages to the Federal Home Loan Bank,
[01:34:58.203 --> 01:35:00.747]  The mortgages are reset at a reasonable level.
[01:35:01.007 --> 01:35:03.571]  The banks were given, whether they liked it or not, government bonds.
[01:35:04.412 --> 01:35:12.263]  Because the mortgage payments were drastically lowered on people, because it was not, you know, serious rates like we have now in subprime.
[01:35:12.867 --> 01:35:19.035]  People were able to pay it back, the housing market rose, and the government actually made billions of dollars on that transaction.
[01:35:19.335 --> 01:35:31.231]  But, so, instead of taking the trillion and a quarter dollars and helping people in trouble with mortgages, because they were given these crazy mortgages with 14% interest rates, knocking down some reasonable interest rates,
[01:35:32.014 --> 01:35:36.757]  Instead of doing that, we paid the bankers a trillion a quarter and took the gamble off their hands.
[01:35:36.877 --> 01:35:38.137]  So people are still losing their homes.
[01:35:38.237 --> 01:35:48.803]  Okay, when Bloomberg talks about $23.7 trillion six months ago and now $28 trillion, that's other ways, I guess, monetizing debt and things that the Federal Reserve has done.
[01:35:48.823 --> 01:35:55.647]  But from the numbers I saw, when it got up to $15 trillion, this was mainstream news last year, that would have paid off all
[01:35:56.327 --> 01:36:03.992]  Of the mortgages in the country, from penthouses down to apartments, that would have paid off all the mortgages and then some.
[01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:11.336]  Yeah, and what we could, and what Roosevelt did in 1933 was say, okay, you're going to pay a reasonable fee.
[01:36:11.376 --> 01:36:12.817]  They were charging 4%, 5% more.
[01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:18.132]  The banks will, because they lost their mortgages, they're going to get these bonds.
[01:36:18.572 --> 01:36:19.213]  And that's it!
[01:36:19.293 --> 01:36:24.056]  And then it's all guaranteed, and the housing market recovered, and people stopped losing their homes.
[01:36:24.556 --> 01:36:31.000]  And when people stop losing their homes, you know, you can't... I was just in 8 Mile Detroit.
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:37.044]  I got one guy who had a $100,000 mortgage from Bank of America Countrywide.
[01:36:38.124 --> 01:36:40.026]  Banks are paying 0% interest.
[01:36:40.226 --> 01:36:43.888]  Nominally, they're paying one quarter of 1% interest to borrow from the government.
[01:36:44.491 --> 01:36:47.354]  And it's all fiat money, so in the limited time we have you here,
[01:37:04.164 --> 01:37:18.889]  Go back over the IMF World Bank documents that were leaked to you in 2002, your warnings about this coming here, where you see this going, criminal probes of Goldman Sachs, but most of the regulators are former Goldman Sachs, this civil suit, is that just a whitewash?
[01:37:19.269 --> 01:37:20.549]  Where is all this going?
[01:37:20.609 --> 01:37:23.250]  Because the bankers are saying, let them eat cake.
[01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:26.351]  They've set up the euro, as you talked about.
[01:37:27.171 --> 01:37:34.376]  One of the top people involved in it openly admitting to you that it's about cornering countries and imploding them through economic conquest.
[01:37:34.997 --> 01:37:35.497]  That's right.
[01:37:35.977 --> 01:37:39.820]  Well, and in fact, let me start with the Goldman.
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:53.250]  What they've done is they've, instead of saying that the system is wrong, the system of creating these securities which are not backed by any assets, and it's basically backed by the taxpayer, because the bet is wrong, we pay.
[01:37:54.161 --> 01:37:57.044]  We have 160 trillion dollars of derivative security.
[01:37:57.164 --> 01:38:02.110]  That's a lot more than the Earth produces every year in product worldwide, okay?
[01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:04.813]  A heck of a lot.
[01:38:04.833 --> 01:38:09.598]  So even a 5% wrong, if it's 5% up, these guys literally make trillions.
[01:38:09.758 --> 01:38:13.001]  If it's 5% down, we have to back them up or they implode.
[01:38:13.041 --> 01:38:14.403]  That's their statement.
[01:38:15.324 --> 01:38:16.225]  What they're doing with this
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:23.950]  Goldman action on the criminality is that they're going to say, well a couple of the trades were no good, but it's fuel gain.
[01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:31.379]  They're going to take this one French trader from Goldman and they're going to hang him out to dry and a couple people and that'll be it.
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:36.164]  Uh, but they're not going to say that the system itself is, per se, rough.
[01:38:36.524 --> 01:38:42.069]  They're not going to say that subprime mortgages are predatory and on their face, illegal.
[01:38:42.269 --> 01:38:49.916]  By the way, that's what Elliot Spitzer is about to file a 50-state lawsuit the week that they nailed him for not keeping his zipper up.
[01:38:49.936 --> 01:38:52.618]  You know, they had that information for a long, long time.
[01:38:52.658 --> 01:38:53.819]  They waited for that moment.
[01:38:54.571 --> 01:39:14.615]  So, when it gets to the IMF documents, what we're able to get, and the IMF has never denied the authenticity of the documents, nor the World Bank, is that these documents, which are confidential, which you can see in my book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, or Armat, I have to go to my website, which I put on BBC television, by the way.
[01:39:14.635 --> 01:39:15.955]  Yeah, give us your website, Greg.
[01:39:16.095 --> 01:39:16.915]  Right.
[01:39:17.015 --> 01:39:19.195]  www.GregPalast.com.
[01:39:19.575 --> 01:39:20.516]  GregPalast.com.
[01:39:21.336 --> 01:39:22.376]  And we did this for BBC.
[01:39:23.365 --> 01:39:31.512]  And what we're able to find is that, basically I'm writing the document, and for example, we took the country of Ecuador, that's just one of the countries.
[01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:35.656]  But he said, okay, we're going to squeeze this country and you're going to have riots.
[01:39:35.976 --> 01:39:42.201]  And then once we have the riots, then we could take strong measures because obviously then the military could move in.
[01:39:42.261 --> 01:39:43.803]  So it was like a planned-in riot.
[01:39:44.283 --> 01:39:50.028]  And I actually, I spoke to the chief economist, the former chief economist of the World Bank, Joe Stiglitz.
[01:39:50.555 --> 01:39:51.516]  We're good to go.
[01:40:15.984 --> 01:40:16.244]  Okay.
[01:40:16.485 --> 01:40:28.079]  And then you have the explosion, and then you can come in in third world nations, you come in with the military, suddenly you have the IMF, teams of IMF emergency people come in, no one can object.
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:43.107]  And we're now seeing these headlines that America needs austerity and we have the IMF head saying they're going to do that here.
[01:40:43.187 --> 01:40:46.410]  We have the head of the European Central Bank saying world government
[01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:48.091]  Of and for and by the banks.
[01:40:48.131 --> 01:40:51.292]  Gordon Brown saying global constitution of the bank.
[01:40:51.312 --> 01:40:55.534]  So these Ponzi scheme guys create more wealth than actually exists in the world.
[01:40:55.874 --> 01:41:04.038]  They buy everything up, then they implode it and say now you've got to give us your pension funds or because we're holding a financial gun to your head.
[01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:09.280]  But then when you give them the money, they pull the trigger and shoot you in the head and the whole thing's engineered.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:13.502]  Do you see them engineering IMF style riots here in the US?
[01:41:14.815 --> 01:41:15.975]  I don't think they need to.
[01:41:16.035 --> 01:41:19.977]  I think if they're going to, they've obviously gotten a hold of money without it.
[01:41:20.577 --> 01:41:21.917]  I mean, we kind of go willingly.
[01:41:21.957 --> 01:41:27.559]  These other nations, I've been to places like Ecuador, and they're just more willing to go into the street.
[01:41:27.779 --> 01:41:33.381]  You know, burn cars when they, you know, when they pay the price of cooking oil.
[01:41:33.742 --> 01:41:37.683]  In Ecuador, the Indians came out of the hills and burnt down the capital.
[01:41:38.723 --> 01:41:41.944]  You know, Americans kind of shrug their shoulders and say, well, that's what happens.
[01:41:42.004 --> 01:41:43.685]  I mean, you know, what do you have?
[01:41:44.690 --> 01:41:54.257]  Ten percent unemployment officially, and you have the entire state of Michigan shut down, and people are kind of shrugging their shoulders and saying, that's life.
[01:41:54.337 --> 01:42:01.563]  I mean, I talked to this guy, Robert Brash, who's an auto worker, and who's facing these foreclosures, you know what I mean?
[01:42:01.843 --> 01:42:04.165]  You know, he doesn't know where he's going to go.
[01:42:04.185 --> 01:42:08.788]  He's going to have to live in a motel room with his family of five kids.
[01:42:09.648 --> 01:42:12.030]  And, you know, he didn't engineer this.
[01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:13.011]  He's an auto worker.
[01:42:14.625 --> 01:42:15.986]  And it's only going to get worse.
[01:42:16.126 --> 01:42:20.891]  I mean, there are VAT taxes, carbon taxes that Ken Lay thought up.
[01:42:21.271 --> 01:42:23.854]  It just goes, you know, they control the left, they control the right.
[01:42:24.294 --> 01:42:27.437]  But see, Americans have never been financially fleeced like this.
[01:42:27.457 --> 01:42:30.320]  I mean, the government that I know of has never taken pension funds.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:32.082]  They're now in Bloomberg proposing it.
[01:42:32.922 --> 01:42:40.306]  Uh, that's where I see all this going, and then that'll destroy the market even more, destroy confidence even more, which is exactly what the bankers want.
[01:42:40.667 --> 01:42:42.768]  Why can't we just arrest all these criminals?
[01:42:42.788 --> 01:42:47.050]  I mean, Ron Paul's agreed with me on air that they've committed a lot of crimes on record.
[01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:48.611]  Greg Palast, stay with us.
[01:42:48.631 --> 01:42:50.973]  We'll come right back and talk more with Greg Palast.
[01:42:50.993 --> 01:42:57.136]  He's been warning about this for more than a decade, and eight years ago he got the IMF documents that prove this is premeditated.
[01:42:57.156 --> 01:42:58.957]  Now we have the Goldman Sachs doing the same thing.
[01:42:59.097 --> 01:43:00.458]  If you suffer from poor sleep,
[01:43:00.638 --> 01:43:01.978]  You've gotta try MyPillow!

[01:44:03.210 --> 01:44:04.131]  Tyranny is here.
[01:44:04.472 --> 01:44:07.995]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:44:08.015 --> 01:44:10.618]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:44:10.638 --> 01:44:16.003]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:44:16.499 --> 01:44:22.788]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:44:23.169 --> 01:44:28.737]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:44:29.157 --> 01:44:32.843]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:44:33.323 --> 01:44:35.845]  When you hear the words water purification,
[01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:03.791]  I think so.
[01:45:17.637 --> 01:45:18.217]  I think so.
[01:45:47.637 --> 01:45:49.639]  Greg Pallast has got to get on a plane and fly to Alaska.
[01:45:49.659 --> 01:45:50.920]  He's hot on the trail of the BP oil spill.
[01:46:09.468 --> 01:46:11.689]  GregPalast.com is the website.
[01:46:11.729 --> 01:46:13.329]  Our website's InfoWars.com.
[01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:17.071]  We'll talk about that in the next five minutes, the next little short segment, then he's got to go.
[01:46:17.391 --> 01:46:19.972]  Halliburton may be culprit in an oil rig explosion.
[01:46:20.352 --> 01:46:23.333]  That's been out the last few days with the cement they were pouring.
[01:46:23.814 --> 01:46:24.754]  But, I mean, Greg, look.
[01:46:25.174 --> 01:46:29.720]  They're so out in the open, hundreds of billions of dollars of stolen money that went to bonuses.
[01:46:31.001 --> 01:46:34.265]  They won't say where the money went, the rest of it.
[01:46:35.126 --> 01:46:36.568]  Why are they so arrogant?
[01:46:36.648 --> 01:46:38.090]  Why are they getting away with this?
[01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:43.477]  And how do we bring these guys to justice before they destroy the economy by design?
[01:46:44.684 --> 01:46:49.586]  Well, you know, people are pretty passive as one, but the other is that people don't have information.
[01:46:49.666 --> 01:46:52.207]  Information, to me, is a powerful weapon here.
[01:46:52.547 --> 01:46:53.608]  They control the media.
[01:46:53.648 --> 01:46:59.730]  For example, you've got the media keeps talking, you know, hearing from this guy Peter Peterson.
[01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:04.232]  He's had something called the Concord Coalition talking about how we have to get rid of entitlements.
[01:47:04.552 --> 01:47:09.894]  That's basically taking away your social security and your veterans' pensions and your veterans' benefits.
[01:47:11.043 --> 01:47:11.643]  You know what?
[01:47:11.663 --> 01:47:13.405]  You are entitled to your entitlement.
[01:47:13.425 --> 01:47:14.146]  I'm sorry.
[01:47:14.186 --> 01:47:15.747]  You paid it to your Social Security.
[01:47:15.767 --> 01:47:17.128]  It's an insurance plan, you know?
[01:47:17.569 --> 01:47:18.470]  And they want to take it away.
[01:47:18.490 --> 01:47:19.551]  Well, who's Peter Peterson?
[01:47:19.591 --> 01:47:22.553]  He's one of the... He's a billionaire investment bank.
[01:47:23.034 --> 01:47:25.056]  So, in other words, you shouldn't get the money.
[01:47:25.456 --> 01:47:25.997]  He should.
[01:47:26.877 --> 01:47:27.757]  You know, they don't tell you that.
[01:47:27.797 --> 01:47:29.358]  This guy's fighting his entitlement.
[01:47:29.618 --> 01:47:31.959]  Well, what he's saying is, turn over your pension to me.
[01:47:32.399 --> 01:47:41.643]  When they talked about privatizing the pension plan, you know, they were talking about basically, you know, Paul Krugman saying, hey, you know, this doesn't make any sense numerically.
[01:47:41.723 --> 01:47:43.263]  You can't make more money in the U.S.
[01:47:43.283 --> 01:47:46.265]  stock market than the government.
[01:47:46.345 --> 01:47:48.506]  Well, the answer is, they weren't going to keep it in the U.S.
[01:47:48.546 --> 01:47:51.887]  They were going to send it to China, where there's more money.
[01:47:52.608 --> 01:47:53.788]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:47:54.388 --> 01:47:56.889]  I mean, I've tracked these big banks the last hundred years.
[01:47:57.269 --> 01:47:58.690]  They lobby for big government.
[01:47:58.750 --> 01:48:06.251]  They lobby for cities to take most of the tax money in the states and invest it in these comprehensive annual financial report funds.
[01:48:06.832 --> 01:48:10.412]  And then the public's only told about the budget, not all these other investments.
[01:48:10.452 --> 01:48:12.893]  I mean, this is, this is just pure criminality.
[01:48:13.653 --> 01:48:20.855]  Yeah, I mean, they're, you know, basically they're using the state, you're right, they use the state budget as piggy banks for their speculation.
[01:48:21.983 --> 01:48:31.372]  Uh, you know, and I see it in Europe, where I also work with the BBC, where, you know, I mean, Finland found its pension fund just sucked away on, on the derivative.
[01:48:31.472 --> 01:48:32.813]  They didn't even know what they were buying.
[01:48:33.694 --> 01:48:36.636]  Uh, you know, so it, it, you know, and the money doesn't disappear.
[01:48:36.656 --> 01:48:39.899]  I mean, this idea that it doesn't disappear, it's going into someone's pocket.
[01:48:39.979 --> 01:48:41.561]  It doesn't, you know, simply evaporate.
[01:48:42.356 --> 01:48:44.157]  This is a big shift in wealth.
[01:48:44.297 --> 01:48:48.620]  Well here's the problem Greg, as you've studied and know, they will destroy a country.
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:53.183]  They will take a first world nation like Argentina and reduce it down into a third world hell hole.
[01:48:53.463 --> 01:48:55.464]  They will do that here if we don't stop them.
[01:48:55.964 --> 01:48:58.506]  But I guess you're just saying it's just going to happen.
[01:48:59.451 --> 01:49:01.013]  Well, no, I think if people are informed.
[01:49:01.033 --> 01:49:03.316]  I mean, one thing I'm, you know, I've traveled around the world.
[01:49:03.356 --> 01:49:06.300]  Americans are actually impressive in one way, that they are reactive.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:08.082]  They get the information.
[01:49:08.142 --> 01:49:13.789]  That's why, you know, as Daniel Altsburg says, the good thing about Americans is that you have to lie to them.
[01:49:13.929 --> 01:49:15.611]  The bad thing is that it's fairly easy to do.
[01:49:17.673 --> 01:49:18.995]  That's the problem.
[01:49:19.015 --> 01:49:22.938]  We're surrounded by a media which keeps saying the same thing.
[01:49:22.958 --> 01:49:27.582]  Get rid of entitlements, the Greek workers are guilty.
[01:49:30.245 --> 01:49:31.346]  It goes on and on.
[01:49:31.406 --> 01:49:33.248]  People are borrowing too much money for their homes.
[01:49:33.288 --> 01:49:34.529]  They deserve to lose them.
[01:49:35.009 --> 01:49:36.931]  Blaming the victim constantly.
[01:49:37.777 --> 01:49:41.303]  As opposed to... And the poor banks, we have to save the financial system.
[01:49:41.363 --> 01:49:44.368]  When they don't mean that at all, they mean save the financiers.
[01:49:44.769 --> 01:49:45.911]  That's the big problem.
[01:49:46.332 --> 01:49:47.554]  People just don't have the information.
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:49.381]  They're holding us hostage.
[01:49:50.042 --> 01:49:55.106]  They're telling the people, you'll get your 401k, you'll get your pension if you let us raise taxes.
[01:49:55.546 --> 01:49:56.587]  And now they're so greedy.
[01:49:56.807 --> 01:50:06.075]  I'm sure you've seen the articles all over Forbes and Bloomberg where federal regulators are quote, ordering private pension funds to quote, invest in failed banks.
[01:50:06.395 --> 01:50:10.298]  You know, come knock on your door and say, Greg, I want you to invest in a failed bank.
[01:50:10.338 --> 01:50:11.099]  You don't have a choice.
[01:50:13.195 --> 01:50:14.416]  Well, exactly.
[01:50:14.476 --> 01:50:21.378]  The whole point is that they are trying, that they are looking to you to provide them the capital that they want.
[01:50:23.159 --> 01:50:23.819]  That's what it's about.
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.821]  And we have to ensure all their bets that are made worldwide.
[01:50:27.881 --> 01:50:31.383]  Back in 60 Seconds with Greg Palast of gregpalast.com.
[01:50:31.683 --> 01:50:37.585]  He's going to give you an inside scoop on what's really going on with the British Petroleum mega spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:50:40.206 --> 01:50:41.987]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:50:46.228 --> 01:50:51.713]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:50:52.493 --> 01:50:53.414]  Tyranny is here.
[01:50:53.755 --> 01:50:57.458]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:50:57.498 --> 01:50:59.900]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.364]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:51:05.785 --> 01:51:12.030]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:17.971]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:51:18.411 --> 01:51:22.092]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:51:22.592 --> 01:51:26.593]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:51:26.873 --> 01:51:32.414]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:51:32.814 --> 01:51:35.794]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:51:36.374 --> 01:51:37.795]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:51:38.355 --> 01:51:38.795]  It's here.

[01:51:51.587 --> 01:51:53.509]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:53.989 --> 01:51:56.732]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:10.376 --> 01:52:11.356]  Well, there's several things.
[01:52:11.416 --> 01:52:12.436]  One, this is the old game.
[01:52:34.554 --> 01:52:38.177]  British Petroleum actually owns the oil in Alaska.
[01:52:38.817 --> 01:52:46.303]  And the Exxon Valdez, despite Exxon having his name on the ship, British Petroleum was more to blame there because they were in charge of oil spill response.
[01:52:46.803 --> 01:52:50.386]  And just like this time, they lie about what they're capable of doing.
[01:52:50.746 --> 01:52:52.207]  They're supposed to have equipment out there.
[01:52:52.227 --> 01:52:53.707]  They're supposed to have these rubber skirts.
[01:52:53.728 --> 01:52:56.389]  You just need a lot of rubber, basically, to stop a spill.
[01:52:56.409 --> 01:52:57.809]  They didn't have it in the Gulf.
[01:52:57.829 --> 01:53:02.532]  They didn't have it 20 years ago when the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
[01:53:02.632 --> 01:53:05.093]  That should have never been a big, disastrous spill.
[01:53:05.113 --> 01:53:06.954]  It doesn't matter if the ship ran aground.
[01:53:06.974 --> 01:53:09.135]  That oil should have been contained.
[01:53:09.595 --> 01:53:13.077]  British Petroleum, I've been following these guys for 22 years.
[01:53:13.097 --> 01:53:13.417]  These guys,
[01:53:16.013 --> 01:53:20.736]  The way they deal with oil spill responses, they lie, they obfuscate, they prevaricate.
[01:53:21.576 --> 01:53:23.497]  And, you know, that's why I'm going back up to Alaska.
[01:53:23.537 --> 01:53:26.839]  That's really where it starts, the endless lie.
[01:53:26.879 --> 01:53:36.804]  By the way, when Obama says, well, we still need deep oil, and he opens up more of the coast of Alaska, well, that's not for America.
[01:53:37.184 --> 01:53:38.605]  That oil goes to Japan.
[01:53:39.445 --> 01:53:40.206]  That ain't for us.
[01:53:40.426 --> 01:53:41.126]  Now, what's the number?
[01:53:41.146 --> 01:53:41.726]  80% goes to Asia.
[01:53:43.482 --> 01:53:50.565]  Yeah, and by the way, when the pipeline was built in Alaska, the original law said that the oil must come to the USA.
[01:53:51.165 --> 01:53:52.666]  And Clinton got rid of that rule.
[01:53:53.246 --> 01:53:54.867]  So now it goes to Japan and Asia.
[01:53:55.638 --> 01:54:00.501]  And then, you know, the profits go to London, because it's British Petroleum.
[01:54:00.801 --> 01:54:06.143]  And that's why they don't let people drill in certain areas, because people like BP are lobbying.
[01:54:06.424 --> 01:54:14.288]  Could this be a false flag event, because Obama had said they could drill, and that would let other companies in, and BP already was doing most of the exploration?
[01:54:14.608 --> 01:54:20.251]  Could this be a false flag, as a pretext to shut down drilling, which Obama has now announced he's doing?
[01:54:21.596 --> 01:54:22.737]  I have no idea.
[01:54:23.197 --> 01:54:28.562]  All I do know is that these guys don't know what, you know, in terms of the actual drilling, they don't know what they're doing.
[01:54:28.582 --> 01:54:31.544]  And by the way, my information is that they didn't go down 18,000 feet.
[01:54:31.925 --> 01:54:33.886]  They went down much further.
[01:54:33.946 --> 01:54:35.548]  That's why they had this pressure burst.
[01:54:36.268 --> 01:54:38.350]  They have no idea what the hell they're doing.
[01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:40.732]  And they're operating blind.
[01:54:40.832 --> 01:54:41.913]  And they cheap out.
[01:54:43.043 --> 01:54:45.525]  They're supposed to have containment barges.
[01:54:45.605 --> 01:54:46.685]  I didn't see them out there.
[01:54:46.725 --> 01:54:48.306]  They're supposed to have rubber booms.
[01:54:49.046 --> 01:54:52.548]  Why is it that the United States Navy is putting out 12 miles of rubber boom?
[01:54:52.628 --> 01:55:00.792]  And by the way, Mr. Obama, why did it take until Thursday to federalize a disaster that occurred on Saturday?
[01:55:00.812 --> 01:55:08.676]  If they put that 12 miles of boom around the ship on Sunday, it would have been mostly contained.
[01:55:11.601 --> 01:55:15.183]  You know, the Obama administration screwed this up real, real bad.
[01:55:15.643 --> 01:55:19.405]  But BP is ultimately responsible and they couldn't care less.
[01:55:19.505 --> 01:55:22.667]  And don't forget, they're saying it's costing them $4 million a day.
[01:55:22.687 --> 01:55:25.369]  They sell $4 million, 4 million barrels a day.
[01:55:28.351 --> 01:55:31.772]  And the price of oil is up $2 a barrel because of the spill.
[01:55:32.232 --> 01:55:37.473]  Yeah, it costs them $4 million a day, but they make an extra $8 million a day.
[01:55:37.673 --> 01:55:39.994]  What about Halliburton?
[01:55:40.634 --> 01:55:42.795]  What about Halliburton reportedly?
[01:55:43.035 --> 01:55:43.215]  Right.
[01:55:43.455 --> 01:55:46.436]  Halliburton, okay, first of all, they probably drilled the well to 25,000 feet, not 18.
[01:55:48.596 --> 01:55:51.818]  Halliburton's supposed to be dumping a cement plug down that well.
[01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:54.959]  That's where they make 20% of their profit, Halliburton.
[01:55:55.539 --> 01:56:01.322]  And, you know, they're supposed to check the pressure before they drop the plug so they know that it's a big enough plug.
[01:56:01.722 --> 01:56:02.543]  Obviously they didn't.
[01:56:02.563 --> 01:56:07.725]  They just took the money and they just dumped the crap over into the cement into the pipe and they didn't measure nothing.
[01:56:08.445 --> 01:56:09.726]  And this is the problem.
[01:56:10.222 --> 01:56:16.868]  These guys are cranking in the money and it's not, you know, then it goes bad and they go, oh gee, it's a shame.
[01:56:16.908 --> 01:56:17.929]  Why can't they plug it?
[01:56:17.949 --> 01:56:19.950]  We only got about 30, well why can't they plug it?
[01:56:21.552 --> 01:56:36.825]  It is so gigantic and the pressure is so high that they cannot, that it's beyond, they had no preparation for this and they simply didn't include a remote shut-off valve, which the Brazilian oil company has, the Norwegians have,
[01:56:37.641 --> 01:56:46.289]  The other oil companies, when they drill, they have a remote switch, just like, you know, with your remote TV, so they can trigger a shut-off from a distance.
[01:56:46.769 --> 01:56:47.930]  They can't trigger the shut-off now.
[01:56:47.950 --> 01:56:48.150]  All right.
[01:56:48.490 --> 01:56:51.773]  Greg Pallis, when you get back with more info, we look forward to having you on.
[01:56:52.053 --> 01:56:53.134]  GregPallis.com.
[01:56:53.415 --> 01:56:54.516]  Good to have you back on with us.
[01:56:55.096 --> 01:56:55.677]  You got it, bud.
[01:56:55.737 --> 01:56:55.917]  Bye.
[01:56:58.988 --> 01:57:01.609]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:02.009 --> 01:57:06.970]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:57:07.331 --> 01:57:09.051]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:57:09.371 --> 01:57:14.193]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:57:14.373 --> 01:57:15.333]  How much do you want?
[01:57:15.553 --> 01:57:16.313]  When do you want it?
[01:57:16.694 --> 01:57:18.274]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:57:18.574 --> 01:57:19.394]  When will you need it?
[01:57:19.634 --> 01:57:21.695]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:57:21.855 --> 01:57:22.955]  Will there be any food?
[01:57:23.196 --> 01:57:24.496]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:57:24.696 --> 01:57:29.763]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:57:29.983 --> 01:57:33.147]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:57:33.568 --> 01:57:37.073]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:57:37.393 --> 01:57:38.374]  How much will you need?
[01:57:38.615 --> 01:57:39.216]  We don't know.
[01:57:39.516 --> 01:57:40.437]  How much do you want?
[01:57:40.617 --> 01:57:41.358]  All you can get.
[01:57:41.559 --> 01:57:42.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:45.381]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:58:43.195 --> 01:58:43.896]  Look for Max.
[01:58:44.156 --> 01:58:48.241]  The Orange Home Gain Gorilla to help you with any real estate needs you might have.
[01:58:48.562 --> 01:58:49.603]  You'll love this site.
[01:58:49.823 --> 01:58:51.205]  It's HomeGain.com.
[01:58:51.686 --> 01:58:54.249]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[01:58:54.570 --> 01:58:55.331]  Check them out today.
[01:58:57.697 --> 01:59:00.020]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:02.322]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:59:02.422 --> 01:59:05.186]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:59:05.626 --> 01:59:10.372]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:59:10.732 --> 01:59:14.917]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:59:15.237 --> 01:59:17.560]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:20.104]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:59:20.464 --> 01:59:23.027]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:59:23.388 --> 01:59:30.978]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:59:31.317 --> 01:59:36.582]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:39.505]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:59:39.565 --> 01:59:43.008]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:59:43.249 --> 01:59:44.170]  And I got news for you.
[01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:45.631]  You're everyone else.
[01:59:45.671 --> 01:59:46.672]  Invisible Empire.

[01:59:59.267 --> 02:00:01.470]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:00:02.050 --> 02:00:04.834]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.785 --> 02:00:09.046]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[02:00:09.326 --> 02:00:11.507]  I'm going to go to Lex, Ruth, Tim, George, and Howard.
[02:00:11.527 --> 02:00:13.208]  I appreciate those guys holding.
[02:00:13.248 --> 02:00:17.790]  I won't be able to take any more calls after that because I've got other financial news I need to get to.
[02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:24.154]  Illegal alien groups rioted all over the country, set fire to buildings in Santa Cruz, attacked people.
[02:00:24.194 --> 02:00:29.897]  They've got signs up saying we're going to kill police if we're not given free health care, free housing, and no taxes.
[02:00:29.937 --> 02:00:31.138]  I mean, these are actual quotes.
[02:00:31.518 --> 02:00:33.259]  They're saying we're going to kill you with pickaxes.
[02:00:34.019 --> 02:00:35.481]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:00:35.501 --> 02:00:38.305]  There's almost a complete national media blackout.
[02:00:38.405 --> 02:00:47.618]  AP reported on the people with torches, marching in Santa Cruz, trying to burn down restaurants full of men, women, and children.
[02:00:48.599 --> 02:00:49.441]  That is coming up.
[02:00:51.201 --> 02:01:02.447]  I also want to get to the White House press dinner and some of the incredibly arrogant Orwellian statements from Barack Hussein Obama, real name Barry Sotaro, Indonesian citizen.
[02:01:02.807 --> 02:01:03.888]  Forget the Kenyan thing.
[02:01:04.348 --> 02:01:08.951]  You got his wife admitting he's from Kenya in a speech and you've got the fake...
[02:01:09.651 --> 02:01:10.451]  Birth certificate.
[02:01:11.192 --> 02:01:12.873]  But we know he became an Indonesian citizen.
[02:01:12.913 --> 02:01:14.213]  We know his name is Barry Sitaro.
[02:01:14.233 --> 02:01:15.894]  And he made jokes about that, too.
[02:01:15.954 --> 02:01:16.614]  So that's coming up.
[02:01:16.874 --> 02:01:18.675]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:01:19.156 --> 02:01:21.036]  Let's talk to Lex in Ohio.
[02:01:21.096 --> 02:01:21.757]  Lex, go ahead.
[02:01:23.117 --> 02:01:23.518]  Thank you.
[02:01:23.838 --> 02:01:27.139]  James Traffikant was by far the best guest, at least this last interview.
[02:01:27.199 --> 02:01:30.521]  It's the best interview I've heard on your show in 18 months of being a fan.
[02:01:30.561 --> 02:01:31.321]  Thank you so much.
[02:01:31.401 --> 02:01:34.463]  Get this guy a weekly spot or get him his own GCN show or something.
[02:01:35.023 --> 02:01:39.165]  But Ohioans love James Traffikant, and I know the truth, Racine, is going to start loving this guy, too.
[02:01:39.921 --> 02:01:51.071]  I also want to say that I'm not a TV watcher, but last night I went to my buddy's house and I watched a new episode of The Simpsons, and it was about having a British-style surveillance system in the city of New York.
[02:01:51.091 --> 02:01:51.332]  No, no, no.
[02:01:51.372 --> 02:02:05.485]  Burns told me the government with Mr. Burns, who's supposedly like David Rockefeller, plants uranium on Homer to claim terrorists are going to attack, so they can set up a police state and loot the pension funds.
[02:02:06.283 --> 02:02:13.868]  Absolutely, I mean it was so poignant and it fits in really well, so I encourage people to go to theevilhulu.com, it's on there and you can see it today.
[02:02:14.988 --> 02:02:25.695]  But expanding on that, six months before 9-11, Fox TV, same folks that run the Simpsons, ran a lone gunman episode, and I've talked to the people on the show, Dean Haglin and others, the CIA came to them,
[02:02:26.175 --> 02:02:42.631]  Planted that storyline that the government hijacks a passenger jet by remote control to fly it in the World Trade Center, to blame it on Afghanistan, and to set up a police state in the United States, and the government uses drills of the exact same thing happening so NORAD stands down.
[02:02:42.692 --> 02:02:47.817]  So it's just like Obama saying, yeah, at least my ratings are as high as the place of my birth.
[02:02:48.858 --> 02:02:49.999]  Or are high in Kenya.
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:55.207]  That's why he said, you know, all these jokes are paid for by Goldman Sachs whether you like it or not.
[02:02:55.768 --> 02:02:57.630]  They're making money whether you laugh or not.
[02:02:58.171 --> 02:03:01.776]  Some Republicans have suggested the health care bill contained a few secret provisions.
[02:03:02.116 --> 02:03:02.777]  That's untrue.
[02:03:02.837 --> 02:03:03.578]  There are hundreds.
[02:03:03.999 --> 02:03:05.000]  That's actually true!
[02:03:06.263 --> 02:03:10.905]  See, so, so, see, criminals love to brag.
[02:03:11.305 --> 02:03:14.027]  They love to tell you, we're gonna do this on 9-11.
[02:03:14.547 --> 02:03:19.849]  They love to tell you, we're gonna set off a dirty bomb and blame it on Homer Simpson, aka the Tea Party.
[02:03:20.150 --> 02:03:24.251]  They love flaunting it as like a psychological preconditioner.
[02:03:24.291 --> 02:03:24.952]  Go ahead, Lex.
[02:03:25.652 --> 02:03:26.873]  Well, I agree with you totally.
[02:03:26.893 --> 02:03:28.673]  I mean, it does seem like they're planting seeds.
[02:03:28.714 --> 02:03:33.836]  If you'll let me be cerebral for just a split second, though, the subplot to the story is about how Lisa
[02:03:34.341 --> 02:03:40.506]  No one believes her because she has blonde hair, so she dyes her hair brown and suddenly everyone agrees with her opinions.
[02:03:40.946 --> 02:03:49.493]  And I think that's kind of a tell about where people put their faith, especially in terms of media outlets or information, whether it comes from the government or from different media outlets.
[02:03:49.513 --> 02:03:53.176]  I thought that was a really brilliant kind of subtext to the whole episode.
[02:03:53.216 --> 02:03:55.058]  I don't know if that'll be lost on most people.
[02:03:55.638 --> 02:04:02.824]  Um, so I do think you're right that they are planting seeds, but at the same time I think that there's maybe kind of a little more, uh, uh, you know,
[02:04:03.524 --> 02:04:06.766]  A push to say, hey, if you're really paying attention, we're telling you what's going on.
[02:04:06.806 --> 02:04:17.632]  The last thing I want to ask you, Alex, and this is just playing devil's advocate, but when we see those people that are supposedly illegal, threatening violence and things like that, is there a chance that those people are COINTELPRO?
[02:04:17.692 --> 02:04:19.313]  That they're plants?
[02:04:19.333 --> 02:04:21.634]  I got my verbal militia buddies on the line here.
[02:04:21.654 --> 02:04:24.956]  We're all chatting while we're on and just kind of want to know what you think about...
[02:04:25.552 --> 02:04:36.661]  I appreciate your call, but to even try to describe why I don't believe that's the case, hundreds of pieces of data go into my statement that this is real.
[02:04:38.562 --> 02:04:52.854]  If these were provocateur actions of the illegals, burning down buildings, knocking out the windows of 20 plus facilities, they said 18, now it's 20, running around with signs saying we're going to kill police, running around with pickaxes saying we're going to kill you,
[02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:59.476]  If that was provocateured, they'd have people, what are we going to do America?
[02:04:59.676 --> 02:05:04.282]  And they'd have a solution, you know, naked body scanners or kicking the illegals out.
[02:05:04.823 --> 02:05:06.045]  There's almost a complete...
[02:05:07.395 --> 02:05:08.275]  News blackout.
[02:05:08.395 --> 02:05:13.978]  When something's staged, you see the PR frenzy that comes immediately when it happens.
[02:05:14.558 --> 02:05:21.561]  I mean, I knew the underwear bombing was staged, because ten minutes after it was announced on the news, they were saying, don't worry, we've now ordered naked body scanners.
[02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:23.322]  I knew they'd ordered them a year before.
[02:05:23.742 --> 02:05:28.144]  Then it came out, witnesses on the plane, so they helped him get on the plane, he was protected, and the U.S.
[02:05:28.164 --> 02:05:32.306]  government admitted, okay, it was part of, you know, some secret thing, we ordered him to be allowed on.
[02:05:32.686 --> 02:05:36.348]  And then the evidence goes on from there, we cover it in my new police state film, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:05:37.468 --> 02:05:40.209]  You know, this woman saying, I got pickaxes, I'm going to kill you.
[02:05:40.690 --> 02:05:44.751]  If she is a provocateur, she's going to win the Academy Award.
[02:05:45.852 --> 02:05:46.872]  No, I've been around it.
[02:05:47.032 --> 02:05:47.652]  I've seen it.
[02:05:48.593 --> 02:05:49.353]  I understand it.
[02:05:49.853 --> 02:05:50.514]  And so, no.
[02:05:52.134 --> 02:05:55.776]  There could be provocateur in the future, but the globalists want the illegals here.
[02:05:55.956 --> 02:05:57.176]  They want to bankrupt the states.
[02:05:57.417 --> 02:05:58.857]  They want an outside voting bloc.
[02:05:59.257 --> 02:06:00.478]  So they're not covering it.
[02:06:00.858 --> 02:06:02.899]  It's the cover-up that tells you it's real.
[02:06:03.079 --> 02:06:05.040]  You know, we've had real terror attacks in America.
[02:06:05.879 --> 02:06:06.759]  We've had hundreds of them.
[02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:15.083]  Back in the 60s and 70s, there were hundreds of real communist bombings that would be in the news, but the back of the paper.
[02:06:15.123 --> 02:06:18.764]  And US policy was, we don't give attention to terrorism.
[02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:24.307]  And any mainline media reporter, you know, people that have been in the news for 30, 40 years, they'll tell you that was the rule.
[02:06:24.607 --> 02:06:27.508]  You report it, but you don't fear monger, and you don't give it a lot of attention.
[02:06:27.848 --> 02:06:31.710]  Because that then makes real terrorist attack more, if that's their aim.
[02:06:32.190 --> 02:06:34.511]  See, the terrorists want the media attention.
[02:06:34.852 --> 02:06:41.215]  So when it's a government-staged terror attack, they're going to hype it because they're the terrorists.
[02:06:42.096 --> 02:06:43.977]  You have to understand the psychology of this.
[02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:50.001]  But again, no, this is real.
[02:06:51.092 --> 02:06:56.375]  In fact, I had Watson post my film, Battle for the Republic, a mini-film that was part of Endgame.
[02:06:57.316 --> 02:06:59.037]  It's the extras, or one of the extras.
[02:06:59.517 --> 02:07:02.459]  And, I mean, you can see illegals with police beating citizens up.
[02:07:02.519 --> 02:07:04.580]  I mean, they're with the police.
[02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:05.621]  They're with the government.
[02:07:06.121 --> 02:07:14.866]  I showed you a headline earlier out of Tennessee, where they got $105,000 from illegal aliens, drug money, and just let it go.
[02:07:14.906 --> 02:07:16.187]  In fact, will you guys pull that up?
[02:07:16.547 --> 02:07:17.388]  Because I can't find it.
[02:07:19.155 --> 02:07:20.396]  I've got too many articles in here.
[02:07:20.416 --> 02:07:23.997]  See, I said I'd go to your calls, and I'm not even going to have time to if I don't shut up.
[02:07:24.817 --> 02:07:25.238]  Where is it?
[02:07:26.278 --> 02:07:32.061]  Pull up that headline that we printed an hour ago out of the Knoxville News, where they just let the illegals go.
[02:07:32.361 --> 02:07:34.182]  The illegal aliens are above the law.
[02:07:34.202 --> 02:07:36.342]  We'll put that on screen for people, and I'll give you the actual headline.
[02:07:36.643 --> 02:07:41.625]  Deputies seize $105,000 after Mexicans deny cash was theirs, and they just let them go.
[02:07:42.205 --> 02:07:44.626]  See, if that was a citizen, your life would be over.
[02:07:44.846 --> 02:07:57.912]  If citizens would have set fires in Santa Cruz in front of the police and been running around, there weren't any riot police there for their illegal alien rally, which was announced a week before, because it's politically incorrect to have police for them!
[02:07:58.672 --> 02:08:01.733]  But you got sound cannons and plenty of cops for the American people.
[02:08:02.353 --> 02:08:04.054]  I'm sick of being discriminated against.
[02:08:04.254 --> 02:08:06.235]  Whether you're Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[02:08:06.475 --> 02:08:08.515]  The New World Order is for open borders.
[02:08:08.536 --> 02:08:10.096]  We have the SPP documents.
[02:08:10.556 --> 02:08:12.297]  We have got to expose this now.
[02:08:12.717 --> 02:08:14.518]  Ruth in Louisiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:08:15.498 --> 02:08:16.958]  Yes, Alex, how you doing?
[02:08:17.599 --> 02:08:18.979]  You know, I have a suggestion.
[02:08:19.519 --> 02:08:24.041]  We need to call and email CNN, Fox, other news organizations.
[02:08:24.545 --> 02:08:33.751]  Washington, Schwarzenegger's office, excuse me, Governor Schwarzenegger, but anyway, in demand why the police are not arresting these violent protesters.
[02:08:34.251 --> 02:08:41.876]  You know, they arrested a G-20, non-violent protesters, but we are not doing anything to arrest these violent protesters.
[02:08:42.236 --> 02:08:49.501]  If I had a sign like that walking down my street in Louisiana, I'd be under the jail.
[02:08:51.736 --> 02:08:57.599]  I hear you, and here's the article on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that everybody's got to get.
[02:08:57.639 --> 02:09:06.745]  In fact, if you go to PrisonPlanet.com, it's got the full headline that's particularly power-packed to get people to read it because it states, you know, what actually happened.
[02:09:07.853 --> 02:09:09.454]  I'm trying to find the article.
[02:09:09.494 --> 02:09:09.855]  Here it is.
[02:09:10.515 --> 02:09:16.880]  Corporate media plays down pro-illegal immigration thugs who terrorized Santa Cruz.
[02:09:17.301 --> 02:09:23.185]  Imagine the national uproar if 200 Tea Partiers had gone on a rampage with burning torches.
[02:09:24.286 --> 02:09:26.008]  I mean, in fact, that should be the headline.
[02:09:26.308 --> 02:09:29.551]  Illegal aliens with burning torches set fire to Santa Cruz.
[02:09:30.472 --> 02:09:51.929]  But again, if Tea Party people would have lit their cigarette wrong, and it had fallen on the ground, and there'd have been one foot area of grass burned, there'd be air raid sirens and police crying, and, we gotta take everybody's rights, we gotta ban bupane tanks, we gotta ban, you know, natural gas, we gotta ban gasoline tanks, just somebody might make a bomb with it, they're calling for that in New York.
[02:09:52.930 --> 02:09:54.471]  It's all over, my God!
[02:09:56.212 --> 02:09:57.293]  Tea parties are evil!
[02:09:57.333 --> 02:09:57.913]  They're terrorists!
[02:09:57.953 --> 02:09:59.094]  They're going to murder everyone!
[02:09:59.394 --> 02:10:02.115]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens are beating people up in San Francisco.
[02:10:02.556 --> 02:10:06.818]  Firebombing attacks in restaurants full of people in Santa Cruz.
[02:10:06.958 --> 02:10:08.819]  Beating up police in front of everyone.
[02:10:09.519 --> 02:10:13.661]  Running around in Phoenix with signs saying, we're going to kill police, attacking police.
[02:10:14.061 --> 02:10:16.443]  I mean, we're going to kill you with pickaxes.
[02:10:16.723 --> 02:10:23.226]  And the media is like, I mean, I have an ABC news piece out of Santa Cruz where they talk to people and people go, I think it's reasonable.
[02:10:23.246 --> 02:10:24.787]  They have a lot of reasons to be angry.
[02:10:25.507 --> 02:10:28.008]  I kind of like firebombing and groceries, you know.
[02:10:28.228 --> 02:10:31.129]  I mean, it's just off the charts!
[02:10:31.509 --> 02:10:33.190]  The mind control of this!
[02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:35.510]  I mean, this is what's so insane.
[02:10:35.530 --> 02:10:40.612]  The government keeps saying people that want to audit the banks and people that don't want the banker bailouts are terrorists.
[02:10:41.552 --> 02:10:48.175]  And then meanwhile, anybody who's actually violent... Isn't anyone asking why this attempted bombing in New York happened on Commie Day?
[02:10:48.635 --> 02:10:50.716]  Because communists don't exist, the media says!
[02:10:50.736 --> 02:10:51.856]  There's no such thing as it!
[02:10:52.056 --> 02:10:54.577]  We just have a... I'm sorry, anything else, Ruth?
[02:10:55.848 --> 02:10:57.069]  Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[02:10:57.369 --> 02:11:10.722]  It just saddens me that this oil spill that, you know, they have not done anything about, and their solution is, you know, just unboggling of what they want to do to sink the oil to the bottom.
[02:11:10.822 --> 02:11:12.724]  It's just going to devastate Louisiana.
[02:11:12.984 --> 02:11:14.806]  We had three major hurricanes.
[02:11:15.182 --> 02:11:24.085]  Well, ma'am, I know we're praying for you, and hopefully the National Guard can do something, but guess what the news we have coming up in the financial section towards the end of the hour?
[02:11:24.686 --> 02:11:27.907]  I was asking Greg Powell of the BBC about a false flag attack.
[02:11:28.027 --> 02:11:30.548]  Notice this happened the day before Earth Day.
[02:11:31.108 --> 02:11:34.129]  The response wasn't big, as it should have been.
[02:11:34.570 --> 02:11:37.791]  BP is one of the most globalist organizations out there, so is Halliburton.
[02:11:38.351 --> 02:11:46.916]  Just like they shorted the airline stocks the week before 9-11 at record levels, American and United, they didn't short all airline stocks, they shorted just those two.
[02:11:47.256 --> 02:11:49.377]  Rozzy Krongaard, director of the CIA, did.
[02:11:50.098 --> 02:11:51.198]  That's mainstream AP.
[02:11:51.739 --> 02:11:58.102]  Goldman Sachs reveals it shorted Gulf of Mexico right before this happened.
[02:11:59.503 --> 02:12:00.804]  Don't answer it!
[02:12:01.377 --> 02:12:09.465]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[02:12:09.485 --> 02:12:10.006]  800-477-9256.

[02:13:57.978 --> 02:13:58.398]  Gold.
[02:13:58.759 --> 02:14:00.039]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:14:00.299 --> 02:14:06.383]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:14:06.563 --> 02:14:10.385]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:14:10.745 --> 02:14:12.626]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:14:12.686 --> 02:14:14.948]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:14:14.968 --> 02:14:22.432]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:14:22.472 --> 02:14:23.393]  We're good to go.
[02:14:52.224 --> 02:14:59.726]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:14:59.786 --> 02:15:01.987]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:15:02.107 --> 02:15:04.987]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:15:05.328 --> 02:15:10.069]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:15:10.429 --> 02:15:14.610]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:15:14.930 --> 02:15:17.274]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:15:17.294 --> 02:15:19.818]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:15:20.178 --> 02:15:22.742]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:15:23.082 --> 02:15:30.694]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:15:31.014 --> 02:15:36.278]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:15:36.419 --> 02:15:39.181]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:15:39.261 --> 02:15:42.704]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:15:42.944 --> 02:15:43.885]  And I got news for you.
[02:15:44.025 --> 02:15:45.346]  You're everyone else.
[02:15:45.366 --> 02:15:46.467]  Invisible Empire.

[02:16:05.511 --> 02:16:14.057]  Okay, I'm going to continue with your calls.
[02:16:14.458 --> 02:16:16.779]  I'm going to then get into the latest on the economy.
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:20.342]  This $146 billion rescue package of U.S.
[02:16:20.962 --> 02:16:24.184]  and European taxpayers are paying for in Greece is not a rescue package.
[02:16:24.605 --> 02:16:28.808]  It's money to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others on bets they made on derivatives.
[02:16:29.568 --> 02:16:35.572]  And of course they'll get even bigger record bonuses in laugh at you and make jokes, and Obama will make jokes about it.
[02:16:35.592 --> 02:16:37.773]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[02:16:37.793 --> 02:16:46.338]  The disgusting behavior of Barry Sotaro, aka Barack Obama, at this commencement speech and at the press dinner over the weekend.
[02:16:46.918 --> 02:16:48.319]  Let's talk to Tim in Michigan.
[02:16:48.359 --> 02:16:49.200]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:50.460]  Hey, Alex.
[02:16:51.261 --> 02:16:51.801]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:51.841 --> 02:16:53.482]  Thanks for having me on again, buddy.
[02:16:53.522 --> 02:16:56.364]  Listen, we unknowingly both have
[02:16:57.077 --> 02:16:57.477]  I think.
[02:16:57.737 --> 02:17:01.578]  I believe they have the key to, uh, you know, who this, uh, Fed was.
[02:17:01.858 --> 02:17:03.619]  Um, and I tried to share this information.
[02:17:03.639 --> 02:17:04.279]  Well, listen, listen.
[02:17:04.299 --> 02:17:06.720]  The average listener that just tuned in doesn't know what you're talking about.
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:19.643]  Uh, AP reports the federal judge has ordered the release, uh, on bail of the Hattari militia, uh, and, and is saying in their ruling that it does look like it may have just been free speech and this was all just hype.
[02:17:19.903 --> 02:17:21.464]  They weren't planning to attack anybody.
[02:17:21.484 --> 02:17:21.804]  Go ahead.
[02:17:22.523 --> 02:17:23.103]  Exactly.
[02:17:23.184 --> 02:17:23.644]  Thank you.
[02:17:23.764 --> 02:17:24.625]  And you know what?
[02:17:24.905 --> 02:17:30.309]  I actually got a chill when you put that on the air because I said justice
[02:17:30.876 --> 02:17:39.098]  Sometimes it does work for the people, and just them letting them out on their own recognizance, although they're watching them very carefully.
[02:17:39.118 --> 02:17:46.720]  Yeah, the judge is seeing the evidence that for a year and a half there was an FBI agent, an informant in there, nine members, two of them are feds, provocateuring them.
[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:50.141]  He gives some speech saying there may come a time we've got to fight the government.
[02:17:50.541 --> 02:17:52.102]  Well, I mean, who isn't saying that?
[02:17:52.162 --> 02:17:54.042]  I mean, the government's completely out of control.
[02:17:54.062 --> 02:17:54.842]  Exactly.
[02:17:54.882 --> 02:17:55.302]  Go ahead.
[02:17:57.954 --> 02:18:00.395]  Anyway, I just wanted to say a couple things.
[02:18:00.775 --> 02:18:06.357]  I want to be really careful so that this information doesn't get, you know, misconstrued between the two of us.
[02:18:06.757 --> 02:18:08.018]  I still have all the articles.
[02:18:08.498 --> 02:18:16.181]  What happened was how I feel that this Thomas Payette-esque character is the inside fad.
[02:18:16.241 --> 02:18:19.862]  We both noticed the difference in his skin tone, and he didn't even look like them.
[02:18:20.302 --> 02:18:22.823]  But what happened was, is my girlfriend and I
[02:18:23.394 --> 02:18:37.898]  I talked to you earlier in the show one day, and you had spoke about an article that the Wall Street Journal had put out specifically on this paycheck character, and they referred to some cooperating witness.
[02:18:38.318 --> 02:18:42.579]  Now what happened was, Alex, I went back in my history because I said, yeah, that's the article.
[02:18:43.078 --> 02:18:44.119]  And it was so weird about it.
[02:18:44.139 --> 02:18:44.720]  It was real vague.
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:47.203]  We didn't know if they were talking about him or somebody else.
[02:18:47.524 --> 02:18:50.327]  Now, I don't know if you remember that article, but you read it.
[02:18:50.408 --> 02:18:58.498]  Now, I remember it wasn't... I clicked back in my history and I found that the article had been completely washed.
[02:18:59.059 --> 02:19:00.059]  And it was changed.
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:02.020]  I clicked on it, my history.
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:03.301]  No, I noticed that.
[02:19:03.501 --> 02:19:04.081]  I noticed that.
[02:19:04.681 --> 02:19:17.987]  It's out there in our stacks as we, you know, we keep the articles for a few years in big boxes, that the Wall Street Journal had said that, and then it had changed, but then weeks later it did come out that they did have the informants in there provocateuring them, but didn't say the name.
[02:19:18.427 --> 02:19:23.429]  I had noticed, because I'd reprinted it, and I was like, it's the same headline, but where's that other article?
[02:19:23.489 --> 02:19:24.529]  It said something different.
[02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:25.950]  I noticed the same thing.
[02:19:26.730 --> 02:19:31.140]  And if you notice underneath the washed article, the second article that was in later that day...
[02:19:31.718 --> 02:19:34.519]  Underneath it, it says European Press Photo Agency.
[02:19:34.759 --> 02:19:35.899]  That's not a mug shot!
[02:19:36.259 --> 02:19:39.600]  And then there was only one little paragraph about... That's right.
[02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:44.481]  It said that he was in another state now, and it wasn't even a mug shot.
[02:19:44.781 --> 02:19:48.982]  He wasn't in the regular mug shots, and I said, I bet he's the one.
[02:19:49.042 --> 02:19:52.823]  We don't know, but out of nine, one's an FBI agent, one's an informant.
[02:19:53.043 --> 02:19:54.043]  We've got to get on this.
[02:19:54.063 --> 02:19:55.064]  We've got to research it.
[02:19:55.304 --> 02:19:56.504]  This is a big break, though.
[02:19:56.524 --> 02:19:59.865]  In fact, pull up the AP article for folks, that the judge said, look,
[02:20:00.745 --> 02:20:01.825]  I'm releasing these people.
[02:20:02.085 --> 02:20:03.786]  But again, it gave the feds what they needed.
[02:20:04.046 --> 02:20:09.867]  These announcements that the Tea Party militia people are gonna kill cops so they can then go to the cops.
[02:20:10.087 --> 02:20:14.168]  Look how the media lies and says I'm calling for cop killing when I'm calling for the opposite.
[02:20:14.348 --> 02:20:16.629]  But then when illegal aliens are doing it, they cover it up.
[02:20:16.969 --> 02:20:18.029]  I appreciate your call, Tim.
[02:20:18.749 --> 02:20:20.130]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.950]  George, you're on the air.
[02:20:20.970 --> 02:20:21.310]  Go ahead.
[02:20:22.728 --> 02:20:31.942]  Hey Alex, why can't we get, look, if we deprive them of the banks, that's basically the funds that they're running all these criminal activities at.
[02:20:32.303 --> 02:20:34.146]  They're running all sorts of drug money through that.
[02:20:34.466 --> 02:20:36.069]  You're talking about through Afghanistan.
[02:20:36.411 --> 02:20:37.371]  What do you think, Citibank?
[02:20:37.411 --> 02:20:39.392]  Half their money is practically drug money.
[02:20:39.432 --> 02:20:42.514]  Well, it's now admitted that our troops are there to help.
[02:20:42.654 --> 02:20:44.175]  They actually help grow the opium.
[02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:50.037]  Now, I've already been told that by countless troops, and it's now in Reuters, New York Times, and Fox, but they say it's good.
[02:20:50.358 --> 02:20:54.820]  We have to grow the opium, because if we don't grow it, Al-Qaeda will, and they'll get the money.
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:21:01.663]  No, if you decriminalize it, then nobody gets the money, and that's why they won't decriminalize it, because they're shipping that stuff in here.
[02:21:02.827 --> 02:21:09.216]  You know, why don't we use RICO and use, I can't remember the particular legal term, but you can sue as if you're the king.
[02:21:09.256 --> 02:21:12.480]  There's a particular statute that goes back to common law.
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:17.447]  If the state doesn't go after a criminal, you can go after a criminal as the king.
[02:21:17.807 --> 02:21:19.547]  They've just got so many corrupt judges.
[02:21:19.967 --> 02:21:21.248]  We need to have the grand juries.
[02:21:21.328 --> 02:21:25.868]  Ron Paul has said state grand juries need to indict Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[02:21:27.089 --> 02:21:32.469]  Ron Paul gave a speech a month and a half ago saying the CIA ships the drugs in, we've had a coup d'etat on America.
[02:21:32.970 --> 02:21:35.550]  The government is criminal and is non-existent.
[02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:41.891]  They're running IRS TV ads saying we're watching you, we're going to take everything you've got, we're Big Brother.
[02:21:42.191 --> 02:21:46.952]  I mean, they are a bunch of rogue thugs trying to intimidate us, basically with a gun to our head.
[02:21:48.959 --> 02:21:51.960]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:55.641]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.341 --> 02:21:59.621]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:59.641 --> 02:22:05.003]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:22:05.223 --> 02:22:09.864]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:22:10.244 --> 02:22:15.285]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:22:15.825 --> 02:22:20.508]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:22:21.049 --> 02:22:22.970]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:22:23.350 --> 02:22:27.973]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:22:28.153 --> 02:22:29.054]  And here's the best part.
[02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:32.056]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:22:32.336 --> 02:22:35.658]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:22:35.979 --> 02:22:38.800]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:22:39.161 --> 02:22:41.042]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[02:22:50.168 --> 02:22:54.692]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:22:55.012 --> 02:22:57.394]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseabank.com.
[02:23:03.306 --> 02:23:04.226]  Tyranny is here.
[02:23:04.566 --> 02:23:08.268]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:23:08.428 --> 02:23:10.709]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:23:10.729 --> 02:23:16.172]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:23:16.592 --> 02:23:22.815]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:23:23.255 --> 02:23:28.797]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:23:29.197 --> 02:23:32.898]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:23:33.418 --> 02:23:37.420]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:43.222]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:23:43.642 --> 02:23:46.603]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:23:47.183 --> 02:23:48.624]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:23:49.164 --> 02:23:49.664]  It's here.

[02:23:59.109 --> 02:24:04.612]  Are you considering taking herbal supplements instead of overpriced and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical drugs?
[02:24:04.912 --> 02:24:06.613]  But just not sure where to start?
[02:24:06.893 --> 02:24:09.735]  Are you confused by the thousands of products and brands?
[02:24:10.135 --> 02:24:15.778]  What if you could find what you're looking for in herbal supplements from one source without the guesswork?
[02:24:16.198 --> 02:24:18.880]  You can at ResearchedHerbs.com.

[02:24:39.737 --> 02:24:44.181]  The journey to better health begins and ends at ResearchedHerbs.com.
[02:24:44.401 --> 02:24:45.042]  I think so.
[02:25:02.208 --> 02:25:04.469]  Okay, there's no way to play all of this.
[02:25:04.489 --> 02:25:06.510]  Obama had a 38-minute speech.
[02:25:07.371 --> 02:25:09.692]  We have the whole thing posted at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:09.852 --> 02:25:11.033]  I hadn't even watched it all.
[02:25:11.773 --> 02:25:18.617]  I watched a few minutes of it and he was joking about Goldman Sachs robbing us and joking about the health care bill taking over.
[02:25:19.098 --> 02:25:23.680]  I just found another video that the guys have posted up at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.522]  Obama jokes about killing people via drones.
[02:25:27.022 --> 02:25:29.664]  And at the start of the show I had said I was going to play clips
[02:25:30.924 --> 02:25:42.227]  of this correspondence dinner where he made jokes about the banks ripping us off and I said that's similar to Bush making jokes about where are the WMDs at another correspondence dinner.
[02:25:42.547 --> 02:25:44.108]  None under here, none under there.
[02:25:44.588 --> 02:25:47.389]  Showing photos of himself in the White House looking underneath his desk.
[02:25:48.409 --> 02:25:55.071]  This is how they throw it in our face and what's so chilling is Obama made jokes about Goldman Sachs and health care that are actually true.
[02:25:55.911 --> 02:25:56.631]  So did Bush.
[02:25:56.711 --> 02:25:58.972]  It's a big joke a million Iraqis are dead.
[02:26:00.083 --> 02:26:06.606]  Regardless of what you think of the war, lying about WMDs, as the White House and Downing Street Memo shows, is so criminal!
[02:26:08.347 --> 02:26:09.067]  Well, it's coming up.
[02:26:09.927 --> 02:26:10.467]  It's coming up.
[02:26:11.548 --> 02:26:13.689]  And I have some other news I want to get to as well.
[02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.193]  This always happens in the last hour.
[02:26:17.213 --> 02:26:22.615]  It's one of the most important hours, I think, to listen to with a four-hour show, because we end up kind of condensing everything that we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:26:22.635 --> 02:26:26.497]  I mentioned this earlier, but I want to get briefly back into it, because it's so important.
[02:26:26.897 --> 02:26:31.238]  Greece gets $146 billion rescue in EU IMF package Bloomberg.
[02:26:32.058 --> 02:26:41.001]  Now, this headline ought to read that Goldman Sachs successfully takes over Greece, steals another $148 billion.
[02:26:42.731 --> 02:27:04.885]  Because when you read the actual news out of the Times of London and other publications of what's happening, they're telling Greece that private citizens and government citizens, whether you're retired government or private sector, they've got to give up half their pension funds.
[02:27:05.126 --> 02:27:06.827]  And a few years later, they'll get the other half.
[02:27:07.597 --> 02:27:13.000]  And they've got a pair of military police paid for with the taxpayer money, and they're gonna bank rob these people?
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:14.481]  If they don't like it, the cops will kill them!
[02:27:15.441 --> 02:27:20.884]  And when the cops end up losing their pension funds, they'll just suck it up and take it, because everyone loves to serve tyranny.
[02:27:21.124 --> 02:27:24.106]  They get off on it, feeling like they're part of the power structure.
[02:27:24.126 --> 02:27:30.589]  As long as these cops in Greece have a uniform, even if they're living in a shack and their kids have no future, at least they're over the other slaves.
[02:27:32.190 --> 02:27:36.272]  So, this has now been rammed through, and I wanted to go back to this Washington Post article.
[02:27:37.128 --> 02:27:40.331]  For nations living the good life, the party's over, says IMF.
[02:27:40.811 --> 02:27:51.579]  This is one of the big private banking consortiums that just got the hundred-plus billion dollars in further bailout to the private banks in that country.
[02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:53.461]  And they're saying more, more, more.
[02:27:53.541 --> 02:27:59.706]  We have the internal IMF, World Bank, Goldman Sachs documents where they brag that they've engineered this entire system.
[02:27:59.966 --> 02:28:01.047]  So there's the Washington Post.
[02:28:01.807 --> 02:28:02.888]  Saying austerity.
[02:28:03.128 --> 02:28:04.330]  You're not going to be able to retire.
[02:28:04.390 --> 02:28:05.591]  We're going to take your bank account.
[02:28:05.611 --> 02:28:07.633]  We're going to store whatever money you've got through inflation.
[02:28:07.873 --> 02:28:11.596]  We're going to pass VAT taxes and other taxes on top of the income tax.
[02:28:11.616 --> 02:28:12.878]  We're going to pass carbon taxes.
[02:28:13.278 --> 02:28:16.161]  And here is ECB president favors global governance.
[02:28:16.561 --> 02:28:17.001]  Forbes.
[02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:29.032]  European Central Bank President, we played this last week but here it is in Forbes, Jean-Claude Trichet, told Forbes that global government is extremely necessary and we want to prevent another financial crisis.
[02:28:29.392 --> 02:28:32.375]  So they engineer the crisis, as I told you a decade ago, they would.
[02:28:32.395 --> 02:28:34.337]  They've done it in third world countries over and over again.
[02:28:34.357 --> 02:28:35.838]  I was watching it happen there.
[02:28:36.258 --> 02:28:37.760]  I was saying, they're setting it up here.
[02:28:39.001 --> 02:28:40.321]  They're moving into our area.
[02:28:40.802 --> 02:28:41.682]  They're in Brazil.
[02:28:41.722 --> 02:28:42.583]  They're in Argentina.
[02:28:42.623 --> 02:28:43.544]  They're in Nigeria.
[02:28:43.584 --> 02:28:44.444]  They're in Malaysia.
[02:28:44.684 --> 02:28:45.605]  They're in Eastern Europe.
[02:28:45.625 --> 02:28:46.846]  They've done it to England before.
[02:28:47.106 --> 02:28:48.307]  They're saying they're going to do it here.
[02:28:48.427 --> 02:28:48.827]  Look out!
[02:28:48.867 --> 02:28:52.149]  Then we got government documents as we got closer that they were planning it.
[02:28:52.410 --> 02:28:58.914]  I had BBC reporter Greg Pallis, who eight years ago got the secret IMF documents, where they were planning this here and had planned it in other nations.
[02:28:59.274 --> 02:29:04.257]  And once the society implodes, then you riot and they use that to bring in martial law.
[02:29:04.518 --> 02:29:06.259]  That is in the IMF documents.
[02:29:06.299 --> 02:29:07.480]  This is all planned!
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:09.500]  And if you don't riot, they don't care.
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:11.721]  They just blow up some truck bombs and blame it on you.
[02:29:13.022 --> 02:29:13.782]  See how that works?
[02:29:15.502 --> 02:29:22.044]  And he went on to say, raise taxes, cut your pensions, take everything you've got, read it from Forbes Magazine.
[02:29:22.725 --> 02:29:28.326]  And he's telling the investing class, go along with this if you want to keep your big pension funds.
[02:29:29.307 --> 02:29:36.309]  And the banking investment class is saying, OK, we're going to back you, rob everybody, destroy the entire economy, take everything.
[02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:39.691]  And now it's happening, the final phase.
[02:29:39.711 --> 02:29:45.035]  They're even starting to cut police, except in the big mega-cities where the crooks live, where the bankers live.
[02:29:45.876 --> 02:29:52.661]  I see reports every day where towns in Ohio, in Texas, in California, in Michigan, in Florida, cut more than half of their police.
[02:29:53.062 --> 02:29:58.126]  And then it said in that article I read last week out of Ohio, where they went from 116 cops to 44.
[02:29:58.586 --> 02:30:01.368]  In fact, try to pull that up if you can.
[02:30:02.669 --> 02:30:03.951]  It was Ohio Sheriff
[02:30:05.282 --> 02:30:07.083]  Ohio Sheriff says arm yourself.
[02:30:07.183 --> 02:30:09.405]  I want to make sure I'm giving those numbers exactly right.
[02:30:10.866 --> 02:30:16.849]  And they say, oh, of the 40 plus cops, only one will be on patrol per shift, three cops a day.
[02:30:17.169 --> 02:30:19.191]  The other 40 plus are to raise revenue.
[02:30:19.631 --> 02:30:21.692]  There are no cops when you're getting raped and robbed.
[02:30:21.892 --> 02:30:23.433]  There are no cops when you have a wreck.
[02:30:23.813 --> 02:30:25.214]  And this is now being announced all over.
[02:30:26.335 --> 02:30:30.518]  All of the money, all of it, will go to the bankers.
[02:30:31.613 --> 02:30:31.994]  All of it.
[02:30:32.074 --> 02:30:35.898]  This is robbery on a level never before seen.
[02:30:36.238 --> 02:30:37.239]  So I wanted to go over that.
[02:30:37.319 --> 02:30:39.121]  Now, I'm going to get into the Correspondents' Dinner.
[02:30:39.762 --> 02:30:46.909]  I'm going to get into this other commencement speech that Barry Sitaro, aka Barack Obama, gave over the weekend.
[02:30:47.250 --> 02:30:50.994]  But before we do that, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up of Minus Resources.
[02:30:51.889 --> 02:30:54.711]  Who owns this radio network, the Genesis Network, as well.
[02:30:55.011 --> 02:30:56.733]  He's been in gold and silver for 31 years.
[02:30:56.773 --> 02:31:00.075]  He's had minus resources for 13 years, almost 14 years.
[02:31:00.475 --> 02:31:03.698]  He was a sponsor of my radio show before I was even on the network he started.
[02:31:04.398 --> 02:31:07.520]  And, look, the bankers are going to rob everything.
[02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:08.701]  They're going to devalue the dollar.
[02:31:08.721 --> 02:31:09.942]  They're going to take your bank account.
[02:31:10.202 --> 02:31:11.663]  They're going to try to take your pension fund.
[02:31:12.024 --> 02:31:14.365]  The way to go is the mason jars, folks.
[02:31:14.405 --> 02:31:15.426]  You know, bury that stuff.
[02:31:15.826 --> 02:31:18.108]  Or put it in a safety deposit box under another name.
[02:31:18.168 --> 02:31:18.849]  Whatever you do,
[02:31:20.290 --> 02:31:22.131]  Or bury it a hundred miles away, whatever.
[02:31:22.551 --> 02:31:23.652]  Get gold and silver.
[02:31:24.132 --> 02:31:26.473]  Get it today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:26.593 --> 02:31:33.977]  And Ted Anderson, a couple months ago when gold was $101,050 an ounce, he bought a bunch of it.
[02:31:34.037 --> 02:31:34.917]  He sold out of that.
[02:31:35.177 --> 02:31:38.339]  He sold it to you as it went to $1,100, $1,150, and right up close to $1,200 an ounce right now, $1,200 an ounce.
[02:31:46.969 --> 02:31:50.171]  It had to go up, but it's still lower than anybody else has.
[02:31:50.211 --> 02:31:53.073]  This is still gold and silver he bought in the next wave.
[02:31:53.813 --> 02:32:00.097]  As it was going up, he was buying it and holding it to sell it to you at a lower price once it went up.
[02:32:00.978 --> 02:32:02.058]  You can't beat that deal.
[02:32:02.098 --> 02:32:07.361]  So I wanted to briefly have Ted Anderson up to tell folks about today's special offer and the new prices.
[02:32:07.602 --> 02:32:08.162]  Ted Anderson.
[02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:10.402]  Yeah, hey, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:32:10.462 --> 02:32:11.804]  It's funny watching the U.S.
[02:32:11.884 --> 02:32:21.054]  dollar rise as gold rises even faster, which just means that the Europeans' currencies are falling faster than the United States dollar is.
[02:32:21.114 --> 02:32:21.455]  It's just...
[02:32:22.168 --> 02:32:24.250]  You know, before I would look for the U.S.
[02:32:24.290 --> 02:32:26.271]  dollar to fall for gold to rise in price.
[02:32:26.571 --> 02:32:29.794]  Now gold just rises against all the currencies no matter what's going on.
[02:32:30.194 --> 02:32:32.776]  There's just so much economic activity out here.
[02:32:33.036 --> 02:32:39.281]  People should be shaking in their shoes if they knew how much debt was growing and what the consequences of that would be.
[02:32:39.421 --> 02:32:43.143]  Obama has spent more money than all presidents before him combined and he just got it started.
[02:32:43.624 --> 02:32:45.205]  He did that before he was in office a year.
[02:32:46.746 --> 02:32:51.970]  All laws of economics say they're going to try to take the pension funds and they will devalue the dollar.
[02:32:52.130 --> 02:32:53.591]  Well, you're already seeing that in Greece.
[02:32:53.631 --> 02:32:59.853]  Could you imagine if that was happening here in the United States, that we're going to have to cut our pension funds because some foreigner says we have to do it?
[02:32:59.873 --> 02:33:00.714]  They're now announcing.
[02:33:00.754 --> 02:33:02.114]  The feds are saying they're getting ready to.
[02:33:02.634 --> 02:33:04.815]  You know, obviously that's going to happen here too.
[02:33:04.875 --> 02:33:05.696]  If you want to have any
[02:33:07.533 --> 02:33:18.016]  Oh, they're already brainwashing the yuppies that that's how they... And yuppies will want to feel like they're official and in power, so they'll go, here's my money, I'm agreeing with the government, I have power, I'm part of it.
[02:33:18.216 --> 02:33:21.437]  It's a delusional fruitcake population of idiots.
[02:33:21.737 --> 02:33:25.658]  I'm not talking about everybody, but the people that think this is cute are a bunch of scum.
[02:33:26.581 --> 02:33:30.264]  Well, gold hitting a peak today at $1,189 already today.
[02:33:30.444 --> 02:33:32.686]  Obviously, we're in a bull market in the gold.
[02:33:33.046 --> 02:33:35.628]  It's reflecting all that you're talking about.
[02:33:35.688 --> 02:33:37.630]  It's normally down in the summer and it's going up.
[02:33:37.650 --> 02:33:38.611]  Can you imagine the fall?
[02:33:39.176 --> 02:33:39.476]  I know.
[02:33:39.876 --> 02:33:45.858]  Alex, actually I was thinking the fall is going to be the time that we're going to see the greatest move in gold, but you know what?
[02:33:46.559 --> 02:33:47.719]  It may not work out this way.
[02:33:47.739 --> 02:33:49.239]  We might see the summer doing it.
[02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:59.243]  It's just completely defying gravity, and it's obviously because the United States dollar is in trouble, and it's in trouble like the European currencies are in trouble.
[02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:03.384]  It's just that the European currencies are reflecting a larger drop right now than the U.S.
[02:34:03.424 --> 02:34:03.944]  dollar is.
[02:34:04.244 --> 02:34:05.585]  But yeah, gold has been going up.
[02:34:06.065 --> 02:34:09.111]  Currently, right now, we still have the Frankenforecaster offer.
[02:34:09.772 --> 02:34:11.795]  They're currently, right now, $254.68.
[02:34:11.835 --> 02:34:17.986]  A little bit higher than it was before, but not by much, and I can tell you that is a low price.
[02:34:18.513 --> 02:34:25.696]  And when you factor in the fact that you're going to get a $159 subscription to Bob Chapman's newsletter, it just is absolutely out of this world.
[02:34:26.957 --> 02:34:31.519]  The silver Walking Liberty halves are at $9.75, still holding them at that price.
[02:34:31.939 --> 02:34:36.101]  That was the price I had them when silver was down closer to $15 an ounce.
[02:34:36.482 --> 02:34:39.443]  Right now, silver is just touching $19 an ounce.
[02:34:39.983 --> 02:34:41.744]  Obviously, a very good buy.
[02:34:41.824 --> 02:34:43.465]  Usually those things trade for more than
[02:34:43.985 --> 02:34:44.385]  We're good.
[02:34:57.243 --> 02:35:08.767]  I try to pick on smaller gold pieces because when it comes right down to trading for the goods and services that you need, you need fractional gold and you need some smaller pieces of silver.
[02:35:09.207 --> 02:35:12.329]  And those British Sovereigns and the Franks just fall perfectly for that.
[02:35:12.769 --> 02:35:15.330]  If you're interested you can pick up some of the U.S.
[02:35:15.390 --> 02:35:15.630]  Eagles.
[02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:17.130]  We have supplies of those.
[02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:23.913]  We have a lot of supply right now which is sort of amazing because typically in the marketplace it's not like this.
[02:35:23.953 --> 02:35:24.613]  When you have a
[02:35:25.513 --> 02:35:28.461]  A push for gold prices like they have been rising like they have.
[02:35:29.159 --> 02:35:36.943]  Usually supply gets dried up real fast, and I'm sure that we're going to be facing that again, and you'll see places like Kitco posting little announcements.
[02:35:36.963 --> 02:35:40.025]  Well Ted, most of your competition is out of gold and silver right now.
[02:35:40.085 --> 02:35:41.006]  There's a huge premium.
[02:35:41.266 --> 02:35:48.010]  You've just been around so long and are AAA rated by the Better Business Bureau, so you're not having a problem getting gold and silver.
[02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:49.670]  Folks, get yours today.
[02:35:49.690 --> 02:35:57.255]  I mean, earlier I played that Pennsylvania Tax Authority ad where they show Big Brother watching you saying, nice house, nice car.
[02:35:57.935 --> 02:35:59.037]  Give us what we want!
[02:35:59.739 --> 02:36:03.266]  I mean, they almost said, or, you know, your kids are gonna go bye-bye.
[02:36:03.306 --> 02:36:05.791]  I mean, you talk about a mafia video.
[02:36:05.811 --> 02:36:06.933]  Did you see that video, Ted?
[02:36:07.214 --> 02:36:07.495]  I didn't.
[02:36:07.535 --> 02:36:08.717]  I'll have to go take a look at that.
[02:36:09.244 --> 02:36:12.527]  Well, it's up on GCNlive.com if people want to go look at it.
[02:36:12.828 --> 02:36:21.836]  Ted Anderson, let me give people the toll-free number so they can call and talk to the brokers and take advantage of all those great deals on gold and silver, that half-dollar silver.
[02:36:21.856 --> 02:36:23.578]  I mean, that's an insane deal right there.
[02:36:23.598 --> 02:36:23.638]  800-686-2237.
[02:36:23.658 --> 02:36:23.698]  800-686-2237.
[02:36:29.884 --> 02:36:33.665]  Ladies and gentlemen, start getting into gold and silver today, even if you buy a coin or two of each.
[02:36:34.125 --> 02:36:38.326]  The point is, start moving away from paper assets if you've got any brain in your head.
[02:36:38.606 --> 02:36:40.987]  And I know a lot of you are smarter than I am, so take action.
[02:36:41.007 --> 02:36:41.427]  800-686-2237.
[02:36:41.447 --> 02:36:41.487]  800-686-2237.
[02:36:41.547 --> 02:36:42.687]  Ted, thank you for joining us.
[02:36:42.707 --> 02:36:43.587]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:36:43.607 --> 02:36:43.747]  You bet.
[02:36:51.849 --> 02:36:59.893]  Okay, in fact, in the last segment, if I have time, I want to play that Pennsylvania brainwashing ad one more time for those who just joined us.
[02:36:59.913 --> 02:37:07.137]  But right now, I want to play a clip of Obama from a commencement speech in Michigan late last week.
[02:37:08.297 --> 02:37:12.420]  And when you listen to what he has to say, it's so arrogant.
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:16.782]  He's saying you basically can't criticize the government because the government represents the people.
[02:37:17.867 --> 02:37:18.928]  And we're a democracy.
[02:37:19.728 --> 02:37:23.711]  No, in a democracy, 49% can be robbed by the other 51%.
[02:37:23.811 --> 02:37:33.237]  In a democracy, if they ship in enough illegal aliens, they can vote to take our guns, whatever they want, and then we'll lose our Second Amendment.
[02:37:33.297 --> 02:37:36.579]  In a republic, everyone's rights are protected.
[02:37:37.239 --> 02:37:38.320]  And Obama knows that.
[02:37:38.981 --> 02:37:39.841]  He understands that.
[02:37:39.901 --> 02:37:43.864]  So this message of, when you criticize the government, you're criticizing the people.
[02:37:44.244 --> 02:37:46.966]  No, the government, when it's outside the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[02:37:48.487 --> 02:37:52.989]  It is our right, it is our duty to overthrow it according to the Declaration of Independence.
[02:37:53.370 --> 02:37:57.852]  But see, that's terror talk today because we're facing somebody similar to King George III.
[02:37:57.872 --> 02:37:59.653]  Let's go ahead and play this first clip.
[02:38:00.333 --> 02:38:01.814]  Sometimes regulations fail.
[02:38:02.695 --> 02:38:05.696]  Sometimes their benefits don't justify their costs.
[02:38:07.677 --> 02:38:12.140]  But what troubles me is when I hear people say that all of government is inherently bad.
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:16.862]  And one of my favorite signs during the healthcare debate was somebody said,
[02:38:18.424 --> 02:38:21.545]  Your government hands out of my Medicare.
[02:38:31.829 --> 02:38:36.410]  Which is essentially saying keep government out of my government run health care plan.
[02:38:38.771 --> 02:38:40.012]  These arguments we're having.
[02:38:41.199 --> 02:38:43.040]  So that's how his logic works.
[02:38:43.741 --> 02:38:52.665]  We have a 10% growth rate on average, no inflation, from 1789 until 1913, 97 years ago we get a private banking cartel.
[02:38:53.266 --> 02:38:55.387]  The banks are robbing us and looting us.
[02:38:55.927 --> 02:39:04.932]  The people are saying, don't take over health care, lower the quality and raise the cost as a tax to the bank-owned insurance companies.
[02:39:05.392 --> 02:39:06.933]  And that's what the health care plan does.
[02:39:07.953 --> 02:39:09.094]  We've got the banking bill.
[02:39:10.151 --> 02:39:11.872]  And I was going to go over that if we have time, I will.
[02:39:12.732 --> 02:39:24.557]  Where subsection by subsection, the big mega banks wrote it to where they can only be involved in banking and can shut down their competition and it surveils every transaction you make in your own bank account.
[02:39:24.817 --> 02:39:28.359]  No longer if it's $10,000 does the government get a report.
[02:39:28.599 --> 02:39:31.440]  Now everything you do is in a government database.
[02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:34.481]  Then it can be stolen, lost, abused, used.
[02:39:34.862 --> 02:39:36.262]  I mean this is so horrible.
[02:39:36.622 --> 02:39:37.843]  Section by section.
[02:39:39.161 --> 02:39:47.727]  And that takes us now to Obama takes digs at birthers, GOP, and his adversaries.
[02:39:48.488 --> 02:39:50.209]  And everything he's saying here is true.
[02:39:50.729 --> 02:39:52.010]  In fact, first let's play Bush.
[02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:54.412]  Bush making jokes about the WMDs.
[02:39:55.132 --> 02:39:57.414]  We'll cue that up and play that in a moment.
[02:39:59.963 --> 02:40:01.023]  Because this is similar.
[02:40:01.504 --> 02:40:03.204]  This is similar to what Obama's doing.
[02:40:03.284 --> 02:40:04.085]  Telling the truth.
[02:40:04.725 --> 02:40:06.405]  Bush makes jokes looking under his desk.
[02:40:06.685 --> 02:40:08.686]  No WMD's there, no WMD's here.
[02:40:09.046 --> 02:40:10.547]  It's a joke to kill a million people.
[02:40:10.607 --> 02:40:11.767]  It's a joke to take us to war.
[02:40:11.987 --> 02:40:13.728]  It's a joke for thousands of our troops to die.
[02:40:13.948 --> 02:40:14.368]  Here it is.
[02:40:15.449 --> 02:40:24.352]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[02:40:25.672 --> 02:40:26.833]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[02:40:36.431 --> 02:40:37.232]  Maybe under here.
[02:40:40.493 --> 02:40:46.937]  And it turns out in another clip we have up on InfoWars, we don't have time to play, Obama jokes about killing people via drones.
[02:40:47.497 --> 02:40:51.319]  This is all meant to throw it in our face and just to train us to accept anything.
[02:40:51.799 --> 02:40:57.823]  Now here's Obama saying, at least my ratings are high at the place of my birth.
[02:40:58.523 --> 02:41:01.445]  A joke about him being born in Kenya.
[02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:03.246]  And the AP interprets that as I do.
[02:41:03.546 --> 02:41:04.406]  This is a big joke.
[02:41:05.006 --> 02:41:05.707]  Here is that clip.
[02:41:06.954 --> 02:41:09.376]  Except for my approval ratings, which have just gone down.
[02:41:12.079 --> 02:41:12.960]  But that's politics.
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:14.121]  It doesn't bother me.
[02:41:15.242 --> 02:41:20.007]  Besides, I happen to know that my approval ratings are still very high in the country of my birth.
[02:41:22.073 --> 02:41:22.994]  Ha ha ha!
[02:41:23.254 --> 02:41:25.595]  See, flaunting it in your face.
[02:41:25.955 --> 02:41:31.559]  We know he was born there, but it's 100% he was an Indonesian citizen and gave up his U.S.
[02:41:31.579 --> 02:41:34.160]  citizenship, making him ineligible.
[02:41:34.461 --> 02:41:36.242]  The next one is one of the most disgusting.
[02:41:36.962 --> 02:41:39.744]  All of my jokes here tonight are brought to you by our friends at Goldman Sachs.
[02:41:39.764 --> 02:41:41.085]  They actually put him in office, it's true.
[02:41:41.405 --> 02:41:43.526]  Don't worry, because they make money whether you laugh or not.
[02:41:43.546 --> 02:41:45.647]  See, he's saying, we don't care if you're laughing.
[02:41:45.848 --> 02:41:48.009]  We're going to rob you, and that's the end of it.
[02:41:48.189 --> 02:41:49.050]  We're the mafia.
[02:41:49.330 --> 02:41:50.430]  So shut up and take it.
[02:41:50.470 --> 02:41:50.971]  Here he is.
[02:41:53.390 --> 02:41:58.534]  By the way, all of the jokes here tonight are brought to you by our friends at Goldman Sachs.
[02:41:58.554 --> 02:42:01.816]  So you don't have to worry.
[02:42:02.757 --> 02:42:04.638]  They make money whether you laugh or not.
[02:42:05.799 --> 02:42:09.301]  See, and Republicans like Bush joking about a million dead Iraqis.
[02:42:09.341 --> 02:42:12.303]  Well, now you're going to see Obama joke about taking your pension fund.
[02:42:13.144 --> 02:42:17.487]  As we go out to break, let's play this last clip, which is actually true.
[02:42:17.547 --> 02:42:20.990]  There are hundreds of provisions in the bill that he lied about.
[02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.330]  Here it is.
[02:42:24.298 --> 02:42:29.324]  Some Republicans have suggested that the bill contains a few secret provisions.
[02:42:30.565 --> 02:42:31.286]  And that's ridiculous.
[02:42:32.007 --> 02:42:34.730]  There aren't a few secret provisions in the health care plan.
[02:42:35.291 --> 02:42:36.733]  There are, like, hundreds.
[02:42:38.844 --> 02:42:53.256]  See, this is their rare time, tonight, meeting with tens of thousands of elitist scum and the lying corporate media there, laughing and joking because they all feel like they're the winners who have buffaloed the American people.
[02:42:53.536 --> 02:42:58.220]  Yes, there were hundreds of provisions, just like in the banking bill.
[02:42:59.136 --> 02:42:59.856]  As the U.S.
[02:42:59.936 --> 02:43:08.180]  and the world slip slowly into economic and financial gridlock, some economists predict a global financial meltdown and economic collapse worse than we have ever seen.
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:11.181]  Don't wait for the edicts to start coming out of Washington, D.C.
[02:43:11.241 --> 02:43:12.742]  before you begin to fill your pantry.
[02:43:12.922 --> 02:43:15.543]  Prepare for financial and economic Armageddon now.

[02:43:59.321 --> 02:44:01.643]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:44:01.723 --> 02:44:03.925]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:44:04.025 --> 02:44:06.708]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:44:07.208 --> 02:44:11.970]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:44:12.330 --> 02:44:16.531]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:44:16.851 --> 02:44:19.192]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:44:19.312 --> 02:44:21.713]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:44:21.733 --> 02:44:24.634]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:44:24.974 --> 02:44:32.577]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:44:32.913 --> 02:44:38.195]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:44:38.315 --> 02:44:40.596]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:44:40.636 --> 02:44:44.598]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:44:44.858 --> 02:44:45.758]  And I got news for you.
[02:44:45.918 --> 02:44:47.219]  You're everyone else.
[02:44:47.259 --> 02:44:48.259]  Invisible Empire.

[02:45:00.666 --> 02:45:01.807]  This is not a drill.
[02:45:01.887 --> 02:45:03.869]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:45:04.409 --> 02:45:06.010]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:45:06.291 --> 02:45:13.416]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:45:13.516 --> 02:45:17.880]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.

[02:45:37.251 --> 02:45:37.952]  But listen up.
[02:45:37.972 --> 02:45:44.134]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:45:44.194 --> 02:45:46.015]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:45:46.055 --> 02:45:48.136]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:45:48.216 --> 02:45:48.696]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:45:48.736 --> 02:45:50.556]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:45:50.597 --> 02:45:51.157]  Hideyourguns.com.
[02:45:51.197 --> 02:45:51.777]  Right now.
[02:46:10.987 --> 02:46:12.228]  So you heard Obama.
[02:46:12.828 --> 02:46:18.391]  He said, uh, this whole thing is brought to you by Goldman Sachs, one of the key central banks robbing everybody.
[02:46:20.092 --> 02:46:23.414]  And don't worry, because even if you don't laugh, they're making their money.
[02:46:24.154 --> 02:46:25.395]  Just an arrogant message.
[02:46:25.415 --> 02:46:28.577]  And he also went on to joke about drones killing people.
[02:46:28.957 --> 02:46:29.978]  It's not a laughing matter.
[02:46:30.038 --> 02:46:32.699]  Even if it was a righteous war, it's totally illegal.
[02:46:32.739 --> 02:46:37.462]  But even if it was righteous, you don't joke about the fact that they kill whole families who are innocent.
[02:46:38.595 --> 02:46:45.097]  But it's a big joke to him, and it's a big joke to Bush, because the ruling class relishes the fact that they get to rape you.
[02:46:45.357 --> 02:46:47.618]  They relish that they're lawless and above the law.
[02:46:48.098 --> 02:46:48.638]  They love it.
[02:46:49.359 --> 02:46:55.581]  And all over the country they're running ads similar to this one to intimidate taxpayers, people who are bankrupt.
[02:46:55.961 --> 02:46:57.361]  Nice car, nice house.
[02:46:57.722 --> 02:46:58.442]  We're God.
[02:46:58.482 --> 02:46:59.182]  We're the government.
[02:46:59.222 --> 02:47:00.222]  We're watching you.
[02:47:01.063 --> 02:47:02.303]  You're just a little slave.
[02:47:02.623 --> 02:47:04.184]  We've used your money to take over.
[02:47:05.106 --> 02:47:10.255]  And hey, we don't care if you don't laugh because we're going to rape you one way or the other.
[02:47:11.061 --> 02:47:12.142]  Your name is Tom.
[02:47:12.342 --> 02:47:14.184]  You live just off of 5th Street.
[02:47:14.364 --> 02:47:15.345]  Nice car, Tom.
[02:47:15.645 --> 02:47:16.306]  Nice house.
[02:47:16.526 --> 02:47:22.572]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[02:47:23.213 --> 02:47:23.913]  Listen, Tom.
[02:47:24.374 --> 02:47:25.495]  We can make this easy.
[02:47:25.995 --> 02:47:31.520]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[02:47:32.421 --> 02:47:35.764]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[02:47:37.063 --> 02:47:38.884]  Find us before we find you.
[02:47:39.844 --> 02:47:41.125]  That is terrorism.
[02:47:41.185 --> 02:47:43.445]  That is taking your tax money and running ads like that.
[02:47:43.485 --> 02:47:56.050]  See, it was public service announcements forever about tattle on your neighbor of their smoking pot or spanking their kids or, you know, oh the government was being reasonable telling us to tattle and now they're just saying we're watching you with satellite.
[02:47:56.330 --> 02:47:57.190]  We know who you are.
[02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:58.411]  We're gonna take everything you've got.
[02:47:59.051 --> 02:48:03.913]  Some other news that you can read up at GCNlive.com that are key stories today.
[02:48:04.474 --> 02:48:11.277]  FDIC shut seven more banks at a cost of over seven billion dollars.
[02:48:12.554 --> 02:48:14.275]  Here's another key article.
[02:48:14.575 --> 02:48:21.497]  Corporate media plays down pro-illegal immigration thugs who terrorize Santa Cruz, setting fire to buildings and attacking.
[02:48:21.877 --> 02:48:25.558]  That's all detailed up there at GCNlive.com.
[02:48:25.578 --> 02:48:26.098]  Here's another one.
[02:48:26.458 --> 02:48:29.239]  Al-Qaeda terror tape proven fraudulent once again.
[02:48:29.259 --> 02:48:39.942]  An Israeli front group who's done it before put out the fake tape within hours of the botched Tinker Toy bomb, car bomb in Times Square.
[02:48:39.962 --> 02:48:42.043]  You can find out about all of that
[02:48:43.384 --> 02:48:44.684]  Again, at GCNLive.com.
[02:48:44.724 --> 02:48:50.248]  And another one here, Bank of America hit with Mark of the Beast graffiti, a Curt Nemo story.
[02:48:50.708 --> 02:48:54.131]  Also at GCNLive.com.
[02:48:54.151 --> 02:48:59.474]  There's another one, Goldman Sachs concedes case for restraining the banks.
[02:49:00.155 --> 02:49:07.159]  Yeah, but the way that that... But again, the actual banking legislation doesn't restrain them.
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:11.302]  And we didn't have time to really get into all that today, but tomorrow I will cover it.
[02:49:11.522 --> 02:49:12.123]  Here's some of it.
[02:49:12.984 --> 02:49:20.328]  Power to collect any information from any other agency, including state government agencies, given in superiority in scope to all investigators.
[02:49:21.268 --> 02:49:23.630]  Number two, mandate companies who pose a threat to the U.S.
[02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:30.753]  financial system, which could be widely applied to almost anything, to register FIRA and submit to FIRA risk management policies.
[02:49:31.334 --> 02:49:32.815]  And again, the big banks write those policies.
[02:49:33.135 --> 02:49:37.217]  Mandate record keeping on all private financial entities with no limitations on what government may require.
[02:49:37.757 --> 02:49:52.608]  Monitor all financial services, promulgate regulations to relinquish heightened risk-based capital leverage and liquidity requirements that increase on a graduated basis for certain bank holding companies totally arbitrary with no guarantee that the real problems like Goldman Sachs won't be let off the hook.
[02:49:53.328 --> 02:50:01.191]  That's like that stimulus package they passed last year, supposedly restricted CEO pay, but it all had loopholes and waivers for all the big companies.
[02:50:01.211 --> 02:50:01.191]  6.
[02:50:01.712 --> 02:50:03.432]  Regulate derivatives as hedge funds.
[02:50:03.892 --> 02:50:06.754]  They are so complex, however, that loopholes will surely abound.
[02:50:06.994 --> 02:50:10.335]  Control all banking and thrift institutions on whatever size.
[02:50:10.675 --> 02:50:12.636]  Control insurance on municipal securities.
[02:50:12.956 --> 02:50:14.677]  Regulate all credit practices and mortgages.
[02:50:14.937 --> 02:50:16.378]  Control credit rating agencies.
[02:50:16.858 --> 02:50:21.500]  And the Texas Banking Association concurs with Joel Skousen's analysis from World Affairs Brief.
[02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:23.181]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
