[00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:11.210]  We have reached the halfway point in this Monday edition, the 5th day of April, 2010.
[00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.971]  I've looked at all the different
[00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:45.790]  Factors that are converging and have been saying for over three months that I believe the government is going to start staging terror attacks and fake raids on militias and tea parties and others as a demonization tactic.
[00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.171]  That's coming up later in the hour.
[00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:48.331]  Also when we get into the economy.
[00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:51.592]  Also, Illinois Congressman, I don't worry about the Constitution.
[00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:53.373]  We're going to play that video.
[00:00:53.593 --> 00:00:54.633]  We are simulcasting.
[00:00:55.353 --> 00:00:56.754]  At PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:56.794 --> 00:01:02.276]  I want to get into the attacks on free speech that are going on and are being called for as well.
[00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.217]  But right now, let's start going to your phone calls.
[00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:07.478]  Let's talk to Ernie in California.
[00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:08.418]  Thanks for holding, Ernie.
[00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:08.998]  You're on the air.
[00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:10.039]  Hey, Alex.
[00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:10.419]  Okay.
[00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:11.479]  I got just three things.
[00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:24.644]  First of all, I'd like the people to get in touch and understand how evil these bankers are to read the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference so that they know that all these bankers were pulling everybody's money together before the war was even over.
[00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.010]  Couple other things.
[00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.212]  First of all, the stupid congressman that says the island's gonna tip over.
[00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:29.792]  Hilarious.
[00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:37.775]  The other thing, Clinton admitting that his free trade agreement wiped out the rice growing for Haiti and basically made them starving.
[00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:42.377]  And the last thing I'd like to ask, what about the state bank of North Dakota?
[00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:47.239]  And how that runs totally separate and having no problems.
[00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:50.641]  Why can't every other state do what the state of North Dakota did in 1919?
[00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:05.437]  Absolutely, that's a big part of the solution is getting the power of credit in the government hands instead of the government violating the Constitution and giving up that power and giving it to a private banking cartel under the 1913 Federal Reserve Act.
[00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:06.776]  Yeah, and one other thing.
[00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:17.159]  Just for the guy, the guy that sounded a little stoned, the first caller, they did find a giant pyramid off the Bimini Coast in Atlantic that is a huge, huge pyramid underneath the water.
[00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.680]  So, other than that, thank you Alex.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.720]  Let's rock on.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.940]  Let's beat these bastards.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.681]  I appreciate the call, Ernie.
[00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:30.003]  Yeah, you know, we don't screen calls on your topics, but we are going to start not having callers on, John, who sound like they're stoned.
[00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:32.143]  If somebody has trouble talking, they're not on.
[00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.111]  Also, the phone has to have decent quality.
[00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.071]  We're implementing some basic things here.
[00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:42.192]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Illinois.
[00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:43.353]  Steve, you're on the air.
[00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:43.773]  Go ahead.
[00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:44.993]  Hi.
[00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:49.475]  You know, Ronald Reagan made me sit up and take notes.
[00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:51.756]  When he brought in two things back in 1980,
[00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:58.525]  One was deregulation, the other one was tax incentives to move big business offshore.
[00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:01.006]  And they're still doing that today as we speak.
[00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:02.806]  But it wasn't real deregulation.
[00:03:02.826 --> 00:03:06.888]  They just gave the banks and megacorporations more power to get more government contracts.
[00:03:07.248 --> 00:03:12.510]  It's not deregulation, it's not privatization to have corporations become government.
[00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.770]  Yeah.
[00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.411]  I wish we had Rob Paul on too.
[00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.892]  He would bring up something about throwing people in jail.
[00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:22.633]  I never hear of anybody doing that.
[00:03:23.497 --> 00:03:26.119]  Oh, I'm no Johnny come lately with all this stuff.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.282]  I wish when Jesse Ventura comes on tomorrow.
[00:03:29.622 --> 00:03:30.983]  He wouldn't drop the ball in this one.
[00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:38.970]  Maybe don't worry about 9-11 as much as 9-10 when billions was traded in airline stocks.
[00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:44.751]  They were going to follow it, it was all computerized, but it died on the vine somehow.
[00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:48.774]  And they said this would be a piece of cake following who brought these towers down.
[00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:59.603]  That's right, that was in AP and Reuters and then it all got shut down when it turned out the Executive Director of the CIA was running the record put options on American and United, Buzzy Krongard.
[00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:00.984]  Really good points.
[00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.606]  I haven't dropped the ball on that.
[00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:15.474]  I've probably done, I don't know, more than 10 interviews with Ron Paul out of the close to 100, where we bring up state grand juries indicting politicians for things that are openly criminal.
[00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:23.040]  And I call every day for moving towards criminal charges against the private banking shadow government.
[00:04:23.926 --> 00:04:31.550]  So you must have missed those shows, and Ron Paul was on in the first 25 minutes, the first half hour of the radio show.
[00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.672]  Ron Paul was on with us, so that'll be in the podcast and re-aired on stations.
[00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:40.114]  And when the show restarts, coming up in about an hour and 55 minutes, that will re-air.
[00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:43.096]  It'll be the first thing that you'll hear is that Ron Paul interview.
[00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:49.782]  That we have with the Congressman, the goodly Congressman from Texas today.
[00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:52.084]  Okay, more of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:56.529]  Love the different directions and angles the callers take us.
[00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:57.590]  We'll take your call straight ahead.
[00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.071]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:11.073]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:18.214]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:20.155 --> 00:05:22.495]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:24.235 --> 00:05:26.436]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:32.548]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:05:33.248 --> 00:05:36.429]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.909]  Utter stone.
[00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.210]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.970]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.791]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:51.392]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:53.953]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:56.494]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:05:56.834 --> 00:05:57.694]  Others don't.
[00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.412]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:02.812 --> 00:06:07.776]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:08.137 --> 00:06:09.878]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:15.002]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:15.182 --> 00:06:16.103]  How much do you want?
[00:06:16.363 --> 00:06:17.124]  When do you want it?
[00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:19.085]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:20.205]  When will you need it?
[00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:22.507]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:22.647 --> 00:06:23.768]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:23.988 --> 00:06:25.329]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.592]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:33.974]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:37.837]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:38.177 --> 00:06:39.157]  How much will you need?
[00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:40.018]  We don't know.
[00:06:40.318 --> 00:06:41.218]  How much do you want?
[00:06:41.418 --> 00:06:42.159]  All you can get.
[00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:43.179]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.201]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:46.481 --> 00:06:48.242]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:49.182]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:00.212]  What's your home worth?
[00:07:00.372 --> 00:07:02.313]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:07:02.493 --> 00:07:05.214]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:07:05.534 --> 00:07:13.036]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:16.677]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:07:42.585 --> 00:07:45.167]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:45.187 --> 00:07:46.748]  Katherine Austin Fitts.
[00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.490]  We're good to go.
[00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:34.952]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:36.053]  I want to go over the economy.
[00:08:36.073 --> 00:08:38.416]  I want to get into attacks on free speech.
[00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:43.883]  You know, Obama giving all these different interviews saying that it's troublesome what's happening in talk radio.
[00:08:44.344 --> 00:08:49.191]  While all of his surrogates are calling for censorship, he says, well, maybe we'll stop short of that.
[00:08:50.971 --> 00:09:08.583]  And what he's doing is behaving like his surrogates aren't out calling for violence, attacking people, calling everyone racist that criticized the government, the black congressional caucus lying and saying they were spit at and called the N-word, now on video, the exact incident, complete lie.
[00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:10.904]  So he plays the part of the high and mighty.
[00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:16.468]  He's not getting involved in all the infighting while his surrogates are out there stirring it all up.
[00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:20.451]  That's coming up after I talk to Herman, Brian, Joe, Jeff, Jake and others.
[00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:22.892]  I want to tell you about a few of the great sponsors, though.
[00:09:23.332 --> 00:09:24.973]  It's not enough to just own firearms.
[00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.935]  You need to get firearms training.
[00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:37.640]  And the biggest and best private firearms training in the U.S., with no drill instructor or tough guy attitude, is FrontSight.com.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.480]  Like the front of your rifle.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.401]  FrontSight.com.
[00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:40.801]  One word.
[00:09:40.882 --> 00:09:41.842]  FrontSight.com.
[00:09:42.362 --> 00:09:46.885]  They've got a deal where you can get five days of firearms training, attend five world-class
[00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:48.653]  And lastly,
[00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:09.448]  Diamond Gusset jeans.
[00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:17.332]  I'm phasing out my Levi's and going exclusively to Diamond Gusset because all the new Levi's just tear out in the crotch or tear out in the back.
[00:10:17.752 --> 00:10:18.692]  They're made in Mexico.
[00:10:18.732 --> 00:10:19.652]  They're total crud now.
[00:10:19.893 --> 00:10:20.993]  Levi's are a joke.
[00:10:21.573 --> 00:10:22.173]  It is official.
[00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:23.214]  I've worn them my whole life.
[00:10:23.754 --> 00:10:28.496]  Diamond Gusset fit great and they've got a reinforced crotch in other areas.
[00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:30.537]  They've also got motorcycle jeans.
[00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:32.238]  Hello Alex, can you hear me?
[00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:58.565]  Yes, I have three quick questions.
[00:10:58.685 --> 00:11:10.030]  Alright, my first question would be, how is it that somebody like me who lives in a big city like New York, how can I go about getting firearms to defend myself when things start to collapse?
[00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.072]  Well, you live in one of three cities where the Second Amendment is basically banned.
[00:11:16.127 --> 00:11:20.734]  They've lost it to the federal court, the Supreme Court in D.C.
[00:11:21.394 --> 00:11:29.005]  saying that you can't not allow people to be armed, and then they get raped, robbed, and killed, but the cities don't care.
[00:11:30.643 --> 00:11:31.504]  Carrying that through.
[00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:39.851]  If you get a background check and give tens of thousands of dollars to politicians in campaign contributions, they'll make a phone call and you can get a concealed carry.
[00:11:40.331 --> 00:11:42.072]  All the Goldman Sachs execs have them.
[00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:44.875]  The off-duty cops get to have them.
[00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:47.337]  Bureaucrats and politicians get to have them.
[00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.659]  And taxpayer-paid-for bodyguards in many cases.
[00:11:50.199 --> 00:11:52.361]  There was a Bloomberg article a few months ago.
[00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:53.942]  In fact, pull that up on screen for folks.
[00:11:54.903 --> 00:11:59.287]  I believe the headline was, Goldman Sachs arming themselves against public.
[00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:06.754]  And so, sorry, you live in the model of what they want to make America.
[00:12:07.275 --> 00:12:09.796]  A haven for criminals in and out of government.
[00:12:10.176 --> 00:12:11.177]  Criminals at every level.
[00:12:12.158 --> 00:12:14.319]  Just like many U.S.
[00:12:14.339 --> 00:12:17.081]  states now, you can't have burglar bars to even protect yourself.
[00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:20.543]  It's about making you easy for the criminal class to have their way with you.
[00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:22.825]  Okay.
[00:12:23.065 --> 00:12:26.627]  And my second question is the nanny state.
[00:12:26.687 --> 00:12:28.048]  From what I've studied in history,
[00:12:28.822 --> 00:12:35.768]  I believe it began with FDR and his New Deal, but I hear a lot of patriots saying how great FDR was.
[00:12:35.828 --> 00:12:37.289]  Can you speak to that real quickly?
[00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:45.396]  Well, I mean, I like Webster Tarpley, and I appreciate your call, Herman, but I disagree with him about FDR being good.
[00:12:46.197 --> 00:12:50.621]  It's true that right-wing, Hitler-backed forces, Prescott Bush,
[00:12:51.906 --> 00:12:54.568]  George Herbert Walker Bush's father, George W. Bush's grandfather.
[00:12:54.588 --> 00:12:56.630]  It did come out in congressional hearings.
[00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.510]  It was confirmed.
[00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:02.694]  They tried to hire the head of the Marine Corps to stage a military overthrow of the U.S.
[00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:03.875]  to then link up with Hitler.
[00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:10.340]  And so people like Tarpley then like FDR because he didn't go along with it.
[00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:14.944]  But FDR did start the process of domesticating and getting people dependent.
[00:13:15.984 --> 00:13:20.348]  But the nanny state is like domesticating pigs.
[00:13:21.394 --> 00:13:40.252]  And I've told this many times, but going back thousands of years ago, and you can domesticate wild hogs today like this, you put up a fence area, you put some grain in it or corn every day, for a few months the pigs get accustomed to being in the enclosure, and then generally with bows and arrows or throwing spears or pits,
[00:13:41.414 --> 00:13:55.930]  You would kill the adults once you got them inside the enclosure, once they were trained to all go inside in a pack or a herd, and then you would keep the baby piglets and then raise them in smaller pens and pet them and feed them and be nice to them so that they thought of you as part of their group.
[00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:01.336]  But then a few times a year you take them down the road so you don't upset the other pigs and you slit their throat.
[00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:04.019]  And so that's what the new deal is.
[00:14:04.099 --> 00:14:06.040]  We're just a bunch of domesticated animals now.
[00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.882]  And now they're saying you're not going to get your health care.
[00:14:09.203 --> 00:14:10.524]  Oh, you blew your knee out?
[00:14:10.544 --> 00:14:11.884]  We'll give you some steroids for it.
[00:14:12.205 --> 00:14:12.865]  Not a surgery.
[00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.106]  Oh, you need eye surgery?
[00:14:14.126 --> 00:14:14.466]  You're above 60?
[00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:15.427]  You're not getting it.
[00:14:15.447 --> 00:14:17.668]  Oh, you've got to wait a year and a half for a brain surgery.
[00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:25.134]  And of course the insurance companies are eugenicists, and they get all the profit and tax money, then they give you horrible care, as Dr. Ron Paul agreed earlier.
[00:14:26.174 --> 00:14:30.537]  And so the right wing will never talk about the fact that it's really an insurance banking scam.
[00:14:32.742 --> 00:14:34.203]  They're bought and paid for by those interests.
[00:14:34.744 --> 00:14:37.606]  The insurance companies play along with the ruse, like they're against it.
[00:14:37.947 --> 00:14:39.728]  The left then thinks they're getting something free.
[00:14:40.089 --> 00:14:46.014]  When it doesn't get delivered in a few years, they'll then push total government health care, as Ron Paul said in the first hour.
[00:14:46.534 --> 00:14:48.596]  We're on the same page because we study the same enemy.
[00:14:49.657 --> 00:14:58.685]  So, people who are on the government dole think the government's their friend, like a pig, when they come over and throw some slop in.
[00:14:59.517 --> 00:15:05.301]  They look up lovingly at their master, not knowing in a few months they're going to be hanging up by their legs, with their throat being slit to bleed them out.
[00:15:06.542 --> 00:15:07.082]  They don't care.
[00:15:08.003 --> 00:15:11.065]  They don't know their master gives them water that sedates them and hurts them.
[00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:15.148]  Because a pig has value in a domestication situation.
[00:15:15.428 --> 00:15:18.671]  To the elite, there's six and a half billion of us, there is no value.
[00:15:20.255 --> 00:15:22.876]  So we have a negative value to the controllers.
[00:15:23.837 --> 00:15:25.197]  Let's go ahead and make another call here.
[00:15:26.098 --> 00:15:29.479]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Michigan.
[00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:30.080]  You're on the air.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:37.003]  Hi, I'd like to talk about the earthquakes and why I think they're being caused by HAARP.
[00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:42.265]  I was on the internet doing some research and I found a graph from a government study
[00:15:44.648 --> 00:15:49.973]  Entire 20th century, the average number of earthquakes between magnitudes of 6 and 8 were around 3.
[00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:53.616]  But in the last 5 years, the number has gone up to 25 and 30.
[00:15:53.816 --> 00:16:01.483]  I also see that... Yes, they're having record numbers of 6 and above, all the way up to 8 pluses.
[00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:06.488]  But you have to understand, that's what the phoneme... and I'm not knocking you, but let's talk about statistics here.
[00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:08.269]  That's what the controllers do.
[00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:15.434]  They show you a 10-year period where it gets hotter and they say in the last 80 years or 90 years it's never been this hot.
[00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:27.322]  They don't tell you the ice core samples show just 9,000 years ago that during the beginning of the Bronze Age the temperature on average was almost 10 degrees higher than it is now.
[00:16:27.662 --> 00:16:35.688]  And so just because since they've been registering things with seismographs the last 60 years and it hasn't been as intensified or as
[00:16:36.638 --> 00:16:38.779]  It's just like they say there's more tornadoes now.
[00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:45.101]  Well, that's because they've got more of the Doppler radar and other systems that catch the smaller tornadoes.
[00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:59.765]  But if you look at more earthquakes, there have been earthquakes so bad that areas the size of Colorado blow completely wide open, and magma shoots 5,000 feet in the air, and the entire Earth gets partially dark for 20 years.
[00:17:02.586 --> 00:17:08.899]  Where I sit in Austin was nothing but volcanoes in the past, and they're now all extinct or dormant.
[00:17:09.481 --> 00:17:09.801]  And so...
[00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:21.474]  If you look at a hundred year cycle, then it is true that the last 50 plus years, because you can't go back a hundred, that there are more intense earthquakes as of late.
[00:17:21.954 --> 00:17:28.819]  But I mean, if you go back to the history books, say 2,000 years ago, Rome was constantly having volcanoes and giant earthquakes.
[00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:31.961]  And now they're not having as many.
[00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:36.183]  I mean, have you seen a volcano blow up and kill an entire city like Pompeii?
[00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.085]  No, you haven't seen that recently.
[00:17:39.245 --> 00:17:41.007]  So, I mean, we are continents.
[00:17:42.568 --> 00:17:46.090]  It's almost what Hank Johnson said, kind of an idiot savant.
[00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:55.557]  Islands aren't floating on the water, but islands are the tips of mountains and hill ranges that are floating on magma.
[00:17:56.378 --> 00:17:56.718]  Okay?
[00:17:57.298 --> 00:18:01.641]  So, but the government did say in 97 they have seismic earthquake weapons.
[00:18:01.982 --> 00:18:05.224]  We know they've been working on it, and so it could be that.
[00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:10.248]  It's just having a whole bunch of earthquakes all of a sudden doesn't mean that's man.
[00:18:10.288 --> 00:18:10.588]  Go ahead.
[00:18:11.815 --> 00:18:19.564]  Okay, this year I've seen that there's already been 72 earthquakes, and last year there were only 29.
[00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:28.555]  There's been a recorded earthquake every day since the first day of spring, with the exception of March 24th, and I also think the timing of it
[00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:36.427]  Uh, being that this is on the heels after the Copenhagen Treaty and Danny Glover coming out, saying that this is the cause of global warming.
[00:18:36.587 --> 00:18:42.470]  Well, I agree with you that it's suspicious that they continue to hit mega-population centers.
[00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.531]  The very city in Haiti that's the biggest.
[00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:46.212]  The biggest city in Chile.
[00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:49.273]  Uh, you know, hitting San Diego, LA.
[00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:50.694]  Biggest cities on the West Coast.
[00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:52.315]  It is suspicious.
[00:18:52.975 --> 00:18:54.315]  That's just as real as global warming.
[00:19:22.623 --> 00:19:24.244]  Um, well, that's all I got.
[00:19:24.804 --> 00:19:25.104]  Thank you.
[00:19:25.204 --> 00:19:26.205]  Thank you, sir.
[00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:30.146]  But do you understand my point about you can't compare a hundred years to another hundred years?
[00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:32.427]  Like when they say we need to stabilize our climate.
[00:19:33.067 --> 00:19:34.388]  The climate's never been stable.
[00:19:34.748 --> 00:19:43.272]  We're a giant planetoid that's got an atmosphere thinner than the skin of an apple hurtling through space at twenty-something thousand miles an hour around a gigantic sun.
[00:19:43.292 --> 00:19:45.273]  There's nothing stable about that.
[00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:46.573]  There's a giant asteroid belt.
[00:19:46.813 --> 00:19:48.094]  Comets come flying by us.
[00:19:48.874 --> 00:19:49.956]  There's nothing stable about it.
[00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:54.622]  The government says everything's got to be stable, the temperature's got to be 76 degrees year-round.
[00:19:55.022 --> 00:19:57.606]  Mommy, is it true we used to have seasons?
[00:19:57.886 --> 00:19:58.046]  Shh!
[00:19:58.066 --> 00:19:59.088]  They'll arrest you for saying that!
[00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:06.809]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[00:20:07.049 --> 00:20:10.692]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[00:20:10.992 --> 00:20:19.079]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:22.021]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.723]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[00:20:25.003 --> 00:20:29.225]  Thieves get near you, push a button, and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[00:20:29.445 --> 00:20:30.846]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[00:20:31.086 --> 00:20:32.967]  Visit IDStronghold.com.

[00:20:54.781 --> 00:20:56.262]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:20:56.282 --> 00:20:58.464]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:12.194]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:16.778]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:19.441]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:21.963]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.303 --> 00:21:24.885]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.225 --> 00:21:32.832]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.152 --> 00:21:38.416]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:40.818]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:40.858 --> 00:21:44.821]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.081 --> 00:21:46.001]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.162 --> 00:21:47.463]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:47.503 --> 00:21:48.523]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:29.689 --> 00:22:34.072]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:39.956]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:40.056 --> 00:22:43.478]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:22:59.129 --> 00:23:02.332]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:02.692 --> 00:23:04.534]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:04.975 --> 00:23:05.415]  Don't!
[00:23:05.856 --> 00:23:08.879]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:18.068]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[00:23:18.388 --> 00:23:22.052]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[00:23:46.895 --> 00:23:49.097]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[00:24:08.193 --> 00:24:12.017]  Okay, John, who's up next here?
[00:24:12.517 --> 00:24:13.938]  Joe in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[00:24:13.998 --> 00:24:14.659]  Thanks for holding.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.341]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:16.501 --> 00:24:17.862]  I'm a first-time caller.
[00:24:17.942 --> 00:24:20.564]  I've been listening to you since December of 2009.
[00:24:20.925 --> 00:24:22.126]  Are you on a speakerphone, Joe?
[00:24:23.527 --> 00:24:23.927]  I'm not.
[00:24:23.987 --> 00:24:24.728]  No, I'm on a landline.
[00:24:25.609 --> 00:24:26.890]  I can barely... Go ahead.
[00:24:28.111 --> 00:24:28.351]  Okay.
[00:24:29.532 --> 00:24:34.837]  In our local newspaper last week, they're announcing a $30 million detention center
[00:24:35.997 --> 00:24:39.051]  That 12,000 people in this area are supposed to pay for.
[00:24:40.095 --> 00:24:42.197]  And I'm wondering if you've got any advice.
[00:24:42.237 --> 00:24:46.419]  We're having some upcoming local meetings where we can go and talk about this.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.862]  I'm wondering if you were at this meeting, what would you do?
[00:24:49.962 --> 00:24:56.266]  What sort of things would you say in order to help the public awaken to maybe this is our potential FEMA camp?
[00:24:56.326 --> 00:24:57.046]  I don't know what it is.
[00:24:57.227 --> 00:24:59.468]  OK, OK, Brian, let me let me tell you how to beat it.
[00:24:59.488 --> 00:25:00.489]  And I appreciate your call.
[00:25:00.569 --> 00:25:09.535]  You go nearby to Hardin, Montana, and you show how they paid twenty seven million dollars for a facility three years ago that they completed that no one has ever been in.
[00:25:10.395 --> 00:25:11.296]  And how it's a scam.
[00:25:11.336 --> 00:25:20.104]  They take your taxpayer money, the bonds never get paid for, but the people that get to build the structure and get the payment, they make $27 million.
[00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:21.806]  Okay?
[00:25:21.826 --> 00:25:22.507]  It's a big scam.
[00:25:23.624 --> 00:25:39.010]  And you also point out that we have more prisons per capita than any other country in the world, seven plus million people in the system, over five million behind bars, and that this is not the type of economic development you need in your city, in your town, and it's just that simple.
[00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:46.753]  That's our fastest growing industry, is government, and of that unit is detention centers, both public and private.
[00:25:46.773 --> 00:25:50.814]  And absolutely, I mean, it's a FEMA camp in the case of Tulia, Texas.
[00:25:51.455 --> 00:25:51.955]  The town
[00:25:53.271 --> 00:25:59.254]  Paid for, in that case, I think it was only like $7 million, I'm going from memory, back in the late 80s to build it.
[00:25:59.834 --> 00:26:09.339]  Then there was no one to put in the detention center that the mayor and the police chief and others owned a stake in, and their families had the contracts for the upkeep, and they had family that were jail guards.
[00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:20.304]  And there was no one to pay for it, so they just started writing tickets, taking houses, planting drugs on people, and it turned out more than half of the black population of the town was in the jail.
[00:26:21.124 --> 00:26:22.425]  But also a lot of white people.
[00:26:23.085 --> 00:26:24.326]  So, I mean, it's simple.
[00:26:24.366 --> 00:26:26.807]  They just build prisons, hire cops, and start throwing us in them.
[00:26:27.207 --> 00:26:28.168]  And make money off of it.
[00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:30.609]  This is how they've legalized slavery.
[00:26:30.629 --> 00:26:32.611]  And they call it law and order.
[00:26:32.911 --> 00:26:34.792]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens are all above the law.
[00:26:35.772 --> 00:26:37.673]  Let's talk to Jeff in Nevada.
[00:26:37.713 --> 00:26:38.474]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:26:39.815 --> 00:26:48.444]  Yes, Alex, I am probably a bigger sports fan than you, but I haven't actually tuned into an NBA game for a while.
[00:26:49.085 --> 00:26:58.615]  I tuned into one last night, and I'll tell you, I could not think of a better example of what Alan Watt would call predictive programming.
[00:26:59.253 --> 00:27:04.058]  They actually had Grant Hill on a commercial pushing vaccines for teens.
[00:27:04.458 --> 00:27:10.985]  Oh yeah, it's vaccines, it's Prozac, it's military ads, it's brainwashing, it's terror updates.
[00:27:11.405 --> 00:27:19.894]  It's all part of, and again, I'm a sports fan too, but I can't spend my time on that because we're going to hell in a handbasket and it's all a bunch of programming.
[00:27:21.258 --> 00:27:28.580]  It's almost like you're watching a commercial for the New World Order mixed between possessions of the basketball.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.780]  I mean, I was absolutely horrified.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.142]  Sir, that's why I can't watch television even for relaxation now, because I see the propaganda.
[00:27:35.422 --> 00:27:37.062]  And once you're awake, you will see it.
[00:27:37.082 --> 00:27:42.563]  And it's like a movie in the 80s of a futuristic 2010 police state.
[00:27:43.364 --> 00:27:44.324]  It's like The Running Man.
[00:27:44.384 --> 00:27:48.665]  The ads on TV from The Running Man are the ads that are on TV now.
[00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:55.093]  Alex, if it wasn't so serious where people's lives were at stake...
[00:27:56.012 --> 00:27:57.133]  You would think it was a joke.
[00:27:57.193 --> 00:28:03.898]  You would think that they were doing this as just some massive joke to make fun of the whole idea.
[00:28:04.018 --> 00:28:05.419]  Well, that is a massive joke.
[00:28:05.499 --> 00:28:15.847]  It is a massive joke for those that are awake and aware, but for people that think the government likes them and everything's fun, oh, the government's going to take my pension fund for the banks?
[00:28:15.947 --> 00:28:16.607]  Oh, goody!
[00:28:16.907 --> 00:28:18.108]  You know, it's oh, goody!
[00:28:19.109 --> 00:28:21.471]  Again, it's all designed for people that barely pay attention.
[00:28:21.711 --> 00:28:24.113]  That's why I said in the last three months they're going to bust militias.
[00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:30.817]  Was because I saw the preconditioning for it, and it's just for people kind of barely paying attention.
[00:28:31.197 --> 00:28:32.879]  What, the militia killed their cat?
[00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:34.780]  That sounds ridiculous to anybody else.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.800]  Turns out it's not true.
[00:28:36.501 --> 00:28:39.543]  It was just meant to make you hate them.
[00:28:39.603 --> 00:28:41.084]  Oh, they wanted to kill cops.
[00:28:41.404 --> 00:28:43.266]  Again, it's designed to make cops hate the public.
[00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:48.589]  And so it's all just background noise because they know the average person isn't conscious.
[00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.989]  Go ahead.
[00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.851]  Tell me about what you saw.
[00:28:52.122 --> 00:28:56.644]  I'll tell you, basically I saw they have their talking points.
[00:28:58.005 --> 00:28:59.366]  I was writing them down.
[00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:07.349]  I mean, I haven't done this before because I haven't tuned into the NBA recently, but they had Grant Hill with the vaccines for teens.
[00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:12.452]  They had Shaq and somebody else fill out your census form now.
[00:29:12.532 --> 00:29:14.373]  God only knows what they're using that for.
[00:29:15.106 --> 00:29:16.869]  Then of course they intermingle.
[00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:20.636]  They intermingle the military commercials in with all of this.
[00:29:20.876 --> 00:29:21.397]  Stay there!
[00:29:21.457 --> 00:29:21.878]  Stay there!
[00:29:21.938 --> 00:29:22.298]  Stay there!
[00:29:22.358 --> 00:29:23.961]  I want you to start without me interrupting.
[00:29:24.952 --> 00:29:26.753]  And see, I want to do a news and review show.
[00:29:26.773 --> 00:29:28.114]  I've said for a decade I'm going to do it.
[00:29:28.134 --> 00:29:29.975]  I finally got the staff and the studios being built.
[00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:45.304]  Where every day, but it's going to take money to have the staff doing this, grabbing propaganda clips, the messages in TV, in movies, in sitcoms, in dramas, then the ads are all brainwashing just to randomly pick an hour of TV and show people the programming.
[00:29:46.064 --> 00:29:48.645]  And it's getting worse because they're building up towards something.
[00:29:49.806 --> 00:29:50.707]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.207 --> 00:29:52.708]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.701 --> 00:29:56.503]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.204 --> 00:30:01.505]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:30:01.605 --> 00:30:03.826]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:30:03.906 --> 00:30:06.728]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:30:07.108 --> 00:30:11.871]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:30:12.231 --> 00:30:16.413]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:30:16.733 --> 00:30:19.075]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:30:19.195 --> 00:30:21.617]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:30:21.637 --> 00:30:24.539]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:30:24.879 --> 00:30:32.485]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:30:32.805 --> 00:30:38.070]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.473]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:30:40.513 --> 00:30:44.496]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:30:44.737 --> 00:30:45.678]  And I got news for you.
[00:30:45.818 --> 00:30:47.139]  You're everyone else.
[00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:48.160]  Invisible Empire.

[00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:00.368]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:00.408 --> 00:31:05.750]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:05.991 --> 00:31:10.633]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:11.013 --> 00:31:11.413]  It's true.
[00:31:11.493 --> 00:31:16.056]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:31:16.596 --> 00:31:21.281]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:21.822 --> 00:31:28.749]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:29.831]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:30.051 --> 00:31:36.418]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:46.223]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:46.723 --> 00:31:48.444]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:58.963 --> 00:32:04.250]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.014]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:32:07.034 --> 00:32:11.400]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:32:13.763 --> 00:32:16.804]  Order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.
[00:32:16.824 --> 00:32:21.346]  We also have some specials where you can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.

[00:32:55.614 --> 00:33:02.380]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.783]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:07.384 --> 00:33:14.368]  Okay, we're going to continue with Jeff, Jake, Tony, Muhammad, Pat, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:14.388 --> 00:33:16.910]  I'm going to get into the attacks on free speech that are happening.
[00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:22.333]  We're going to break down congressman in Illinois saying, I don't worry about the Constitution.
[00:33:22.773 --> 00:33:25.235]  Katherine Austen Fitz coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.101]  But that's why I'm frustrated.
[00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:34.202]  And I tell you this every day because I can't watch all the television.
[00:33:34.682 --> 00:33:35.823]  I can't read all the news.
[00:33:36.003 --> 00:33:38.904]  I can't even cover everything that's going on.
[00:33:38.984 --> 00:33:40.884]  It's so much worse than I say.
[00:33:42.205 --> 00:33:45.246]  And they're just marinating people in propaganda.
[00:33:46.295 --> 00:33:52.843]  The sitcoms are all anti-family, anti-homeschool, anti-people that don't want to be vaccinated.
[00:33:53.163 --> 00:33:59.510]  There's ads everywhere for the human papilloma, Gardasil shot that admittedly has killed a bunch of people and doesn't even protect you from it.
[00:34:00.562 --> 00:34:02.463]  There's ads for Prozac everywhere.
[00:34:03.343 --> 00:34:06.444]  There's demonization of gun owners everywhere.
[00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.745]  There's promotion of world government everywhere.
[00:34:09.065 --> 00:34:11.266]  There's constant pushing of humans are bad.
[00:34:11.586 --> 00:34:19.949]  We've got to have the green economy and it's going to give you jobs when they know it does the opposite and is designed to destroy our industrial capacity on record.
[00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:22.690]  And that's not even the tip of the iceberg.
[00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.851]  It just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:27.312]  My wife maybe once a week on
[00:34:29.926 --> 00:34:38.830]  You know, weeknight or something, she'll try to watch a movie or watch a sitcom, and she calls me in and goes, look, this whole show is about how a woman doesn't give her kids vaccines so they die.
[00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.671]  Or this whole show is about how great abortions are.
[00:34:42.111 --> 00:34:44.212]  Or this whole show is about how bad humans are.
[00:34:44.292 --> 00:34:45.353]  It's just everything.
[00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:52.536]  It's total propaganda, and the federal government spends tens of billions a year per program.
[00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:53.816]  I haven't added it all up.
[00:34:53.876 --> 00:34:54.797]  It's got to be a hundred billion.
[00:34:55.956 --> 00:35:00.878]  With billboards and TV ads and product placement, propaganda placement in the shows.
[00:35:02.618 --> 00:35:05.479]  And we are building the TV studio.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.320]  It should be done in a month.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:13.322]  It'll take a month to fit it all out, get it all set up with equipment because we're a small operation, but your support has allowed this.
[00:35:14.682 --> 00:35:32.276]  And then I want to hire one or two of the right people that know how to just go through the YouTube clips, go through TV, pick out some of the shows we want to focus on, and show lies on the nightly news, propaganda in ads, cashless society propaganda, environment propaganda, world government pro-
[00:35:34.264 --> 00:35:44.012]  You know, tyranny military ads, weird military ads showing martial law is a good thing, local newscasts promoting urban warfare takeover drills.
[00:35:44.052 --> 00:35:48.655]  I mean, TV saying mercury is good for kids, melamine is good for kids.
[00:35:50.457 --> 00:35:51.397]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:51.417 --> 00:35:58.823]  I mean, I can watch any program, any show, except for Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory.
[00:35:59.143 --> 00:36:01.125]  And Ventura doesn't know why they allowed this on air.
[00:36:04.625 --> 00:36:06.206]  I guess it's like a beta test or something.
[00:36:08.067 --> 00:36:09.308]  There's nothing on television.
[00:36:09.328 --> 00:36:18.234]  Well, I mean, every once in a while I'll see an MSNBC clip a month ago where they admitted, okay, $23.7 trillion has been stolen by the bank, so they won't say where it went.
[00:36:18.254 --> 00:36:18.834]  This is horrible.
[00:36:19.274 --> 00:36:21.276]  So I guess that's what Ventura Show is, too.
[00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:26.819]  They allow just a few things to keep the illusion of objectivity.
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:28.981]  I don't even know what it is.
[00:36:31.223 --> 00:36:32.564]  We'll ask Ventura about that tomorrow.
[00:36:32.844 --> 00:36:33.685]  I know he's a good guy.
[00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:34.966]  I'm involved in the show.
[00:36:34.986 --> 00:36:41.151]  I'm in an even bigger role in consulting and on the program coming up in the next season.
[00:36:44.154 --> 00:36:48.457]  I look forward more to hanging out with Jesse because he's such a cool guy and so nice than I do even being in it.
[00:36:48.477 --> 00:36:56.924]  I almost don't even want to be in it because of the attention and all the jealousy it creates, but all I'm trying to do is wake people up, nothing more.
[00:36:56.944 --> 00:36:58.125]  I mean, it's a burden.
[00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:04.094]  This knowledge is a burden, but it's a greater burden to not stand up against it and know where this is leading.
[00:37:04.534 --> 00:37:09.999]  Jeff in Nevada, finish up your point about what you saw just watching a basketball game last night on TV.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:22.190]  Well, Alex, they've got basically three or four talking points that mimic the same talking points that you see if you pick up USA Today.
[00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.272]  Military good, cops good,
[00:37:26.674 --> 00:37:29.175]  In particular, one ad caught my eye.
[00:37:29.676 --> 00:37:34.618]  It shows an older father leaning over his computer going, gee, my heart.
[00:37:34.658 --> 00:37:37.560]  There could be something a little bit more than just heart trouble.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.720]  I might need this drug.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:46.084]  And the daughter leans over onto his computer and real quick types it up and says, oh, dad, your heart could be this, this, and this.
[00:37:46.124 --> 00:37:50.686]  You know, some new disease that they just invented to sell this drug.
[00:37:50.806 --> 00:37:52.867]  So that's another example.
[00:37:53.087 --> 00:37:54.228]  And then you'll also notice
[00:37:54.873 --> 00:37:55.153]  They're
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.780]  Do it in reverse.
[00:38:31.448 --> 00:38:35.932]  Everyone's being targeted, they admit you're being targeted, and all I want people to do is become aware.
[00:38:36.193 --> 00:38:40.717]  I mean, look, you turn television on, they have an ad about face scanning to buy and sell, how great it is.
[00:38:40.997 --> 00:38:45.521]  The next ad is an idiot guy in a park with his girlfriend in this pastoral scene.
[00:38:46.022 --> 00:38:52.448]  It's a red, a red popsicle at a subconscious level, like the Garden of Eden, the woman's feeding him grapes.
[00:38:52.828 --> 00:38:56.932]  It's this primitive thing of the man, you know, brings in the food he's hunted for and the woman
[00:38:57.372 --> 00:39:00.155]  You know, provides for him this image that men want.
[00:39:00.455 --> 00:39:04.158]  Then it's the image that women want of them being over the man and being smarter than him.
[00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:06.441]  And he says, I heard corn syrup can hurt you.
[00:39:07.041 --> 00:39:08.282]  And she says, what's your proof?
[00:39:08.302 --> 00:39:09.303]  He goes, I don't have any.
[00:39:09.664 --> 00:39:10.304]  I'm an idiot.
[00:39:10.885 --> 00:39:11.686]  She goes, that's right.
[00:39:11.746 --> 00:39:13.287]  It's scientifically proven to be wonderful.
[00:39:13.707 --> 00:39:19.993]  And then so again, it's just all when they admit it, it destroys your pancreas and gives you diabetes.
[00:39:20.574 --> 00:39:22.376]  It doesn't matter because
[00:39:23.789 --> 00:39:30.635]  Again, they have a TV ad because they know the women buy 80 plus percent of the food at the grocery store so that it's targeting women.
[00:39:30.695 --> 00:39:31.916]  You're smarter than your husband.
[00:39:32.176 --> 00:39:32.937]  He's an idiot.
[00:39:33.578 --> 00:39:36.500]  If he tells you that corn syrup's bad, he's a liar.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.601]  Bring it to him.
[00:39:37.701 --> 00:39:38.962]  It will make you have power.
[00:39:39.663 --> 00:39:43.166]  Now, women, you shouldn't be insulted by me telling you how they're propagandizing you.
[00:39:43.386 --> 00:39:44.787]  You should be angry and upset.
[00:39:45.288 --> 00:39:46.629]  Go ahead and finish up your point, Jeff.
[00:39:47.583 --> 00:39:55.689]  Yes, Alex, there's two things that I would say to pay attention to, both of which Alan Watt has talked about periodically.
[00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:04.976]  One, when you're watching these TV programs, what they'll try is what you just pointed to, it's called neuro-associative conditioning, the Pavlovian conditioning.
[00:40:05.396 --> 00:40:09.401]  They want to get you, they get you as a viewer into a peak state.
[00:40:09.681 --> 00:40:14.988]  A Super Bowl, excuse me, a touchdown is scored, a basket is made at a critical time.
[00:40:15.428 --> 00:40:22.056]  When your nervous system is in that peak state of pleasure, now they're going to flash military, military, military.
[00:40:22.356 --> 00:40:24.637]  Now, does this mean that every guy in the military is bad?
[00:40:24.697 --> 00:40:32.402]  No, I'm not saying that, but what it does mean is that they are... No, but is military propaganda scientifically being applied to the public without them knowing about it?
[00:40:32.482 --> 00:40:33.883]  This is the essence of mind control.
[00:40:34.163 --> 00:40:39.406]  Sounds like you've been in psyops, or are you a marketing psychologist?
[00:40:40.427 --> 00:40:41.067]  No, no, no.
[00:40:41.267 --> 00:40:42.328]  No, nothing like that.
[00:40:42.408 --> 00:40:47.231]  But, you know, I've just done a little bit of reading, and the thing is, what's very important is if you...
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:56.508]  Listen to your show and listen to the guests that are on your show long enough, you start to see a lot of this is predictive programming.
[00:40:56.568 --> 00:41:02.754]  Even, for example, what they did with Plaxico Gerberas with his gun case and Tiger Woods in his case.
[00:41:03.254 --> 00:41:09.240]  What they're telling you in a mode of predictive programming is that you have no privacy.
[00:41:09.853 --> 00:41:13.736]  You know, if I was Tiger Woods, I would tell people this is between me and my wife.
[00:41:13.976 --> 00:41:15.517]  This is none of your business!
[00:41:15.697 --> 00:41:16.878]  This is none of your business!
[00:41:16.898 --> 00:41:23.222]  I mean, if he'd have come out and said, at least I don't have underage prostitutes at my house like Barney Frank, you know, shut up!
[00:41:24.222 --> 00:41:33.948]  But no, they got him to play into the guilt, and I'm not saying what he did was good, the point is none of our business, and then they said, oh, he screwed up more, he's got to apologize more, and it teaches us that we have no privacy.
[00:41:33.968 --> 00:41:34.669]  Another great point.
[00:41:35.299 --> 00:41:35.780]  It teaches it.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:36.541]  It teaches it.
[00:41:36.601 --> 00:41:41.888]  Now, there was a player from the Browns arrested for carrying a handgun.
[00:41:42.068 --> 00:41:42.729]  Unloaded!
[00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:43.770]  Unloaded!
[00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:48.056]  And it creates the perception that all guns are illegal everywhere at all times.
[00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:55.967]  And you'll notice, when you turn on ESPN, they show a very unflattering photograph of the guy caught with the gun.
[00:41:56.067 --> 00:41:57.067]  Ooh, he's caught with the gun.
[00:41:57.487 --> 00:42:05.709]  Now, I was proud of, there's one guy, Eric Casillas on ESPN, who actually stands up for, he stood up for Roethlisberger.
[00:42:05.729 --> 00:42:07.649]  The guy hasn't even been convicted yet.
[00:42:07.689 --> 00:42:09.009]  We don't even know the facts of the story.
[00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.270]  Everybody else on ESPN
[00:42:12.009 --> 00:42:12.790]  Wanted blood.
[00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:13.570]  Suspend him.
[00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:14.331]  Eliminate him.
[00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:15.611]  Get rid of this guy.
[00:42:15.652 --> 00:42:16.832]  You don't even know the facts.
[00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:43.329]  Great points, Jeff.
[00:42:43.369 --> 00:42:44.290]  I appreciate your call.
[00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:49.911]  You shouldn't wait for Alex Jones to do a TV show about this.
[00:42:49.971 --> 00:42:50.692]  That's what I'm going to do.
[00:42:50.752 --> 00:42:52.832]  That's TV show idea number one.
[00:42:53.413 --> 00:43:01.995]  You should start snipping clips of this, get a little cheap computer program, and once a week call it Jeff's Review of Propaganda.
[00:43:02.475 --> 00:43:03.876]  This week we're looking at a sitcom.
[00:43:04.116 --> 00:43:05.236]  This week we're looking at ads.
[00:43:05.496 --> 00:43:06.577]  This week we're looking at news.
[00:43:06.837 --> 00:43:07.797]  It's all fair use.
[00:43:08.137 --> 00:43:08.737]  Show clips.
[00:43:09.097 --> 00:43:09.678]  Show the people.
[00:43:09.878 --> 00:43:10.538]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:43:11.318 --> 00:43:12.599]  I'm not here to do all this.
[00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:13.540]  I can't do it all.
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.482]  And I'm not somebody who has good ideas and then hoards them to myself.
[00:43:17.982 --> 00:43:20.944]  I'm somebody who has ideas to beat these people, and I say, here it is, here it is.
[00:43:21.124 --> 00:43:22.445]  Use it, use it, use it, use it.
[00:43:22.665 --> 00:43:24.266]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[00:43:24.746 --> 00:43:27.088]  Because the water's rising in this chamber.
[00:43:27.248 --> 00:43:31.130]  We're going to drown politically if we don't break out of here together, okay?
[00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:32.792]  So I'm over here at the door lock.
[00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:47.000]  Trying to force it, and I'm saying, help me, I'm not strong enough, help me, please, please get Invisible Empire on DVD, please, please get Police State 4 so we can prove they're FEMA camps, so people understand how it all ties together in the big picture.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:52.624]  Please, just get the film, make copies, get it out to people, please help us, please support us, please help us turn this thing.
[00:43:59.551 --> 00:44:01.913]  Because talking to Jeff just gave me a headache.
[00:44:02.734 --> 00:44:07.519]  Jeff's a great caller, intelligent, the type of caller we want who's informed and active and has done his research.
[00:44:07.819 --> 00:44:14.165]  And he did some research and knew all the scientific terms of Pavlovian, operant conditioning, and other systems.
[00:44:17.284 --> 00:44:22.088]  It gave me a headache because it made my mind flash with all the other data I had on this.
[00:44:22.708 --> 00:44:25.311]  And then it also made me sick and angry at the establishment.
[00:44:25.591 --> 00:44:30.835]  I mean, having psychological warfare programming, actual brainwashing.
[00:44:32.797 --> 00:44:39.242]  The same stuff 60 years ago they'd have on movie screens in the Soviet Union inside a camp where they were breaking people.
[00:44:40.649 --> 00:44:56.844]  I mean, to read all over the country where the police come in and take over unannounced elementary schools, dressed up in camo and say, we're the homeschoolers against public school, we're here to kill you, and the children defecate, they urinate, they pass out, teachers end up going to loony bins.
[00:44:57.064 --> 00:44:58.505]  They tell them it's real for hours.
[00:44:58.525 --> 00:44:59.526]  They throw blood on them.
[00:44:59.727 --> 00:45:01.748]  They put them on the ground and say, I'm going to blow your head off.
[00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:02.489]  Unannounced.
[00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:04.271]  In many of the drills.
[00:45:06.431 --> 00:45:10.674]  That is a hardcore brainwashing operation.
[00:45:10.694 --> 00:45:12.375]  I mean, that is scarring these children.
[00:45:12.755 --> 00:45:14.836]  Then they tell the parents, well, we're worried about malicious.
[00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:21.180]  In fact, search this.
[00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:26.203]  One of the worst cases, we learned it's happening nationwide, but where people actually complain, so we learned about it.
[00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:27.904]  It was about four years ago.
[00:45:27.924 --> 00:45:31.486]  And it was in the Associated Press.
[00:45:33.347 --> 00:45:34.248]  Pull up the term.
[00:45:37.281 --> 00:45:38.462]  It's mentally exhausting doing this.
[00:45:38.482 --> 00:45:39.503]  I'm not complaining.
[00:45:39.543 --> 00:45:41.105]  It's just that it's starting to weigh on me, folks.
[00:45:41.786 --> 00:45:42.767]  The level of knowledge.
[00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:44.408]  And if you research, you'd have this knowledge too.
[00:45:44.428 --> 00:45:46.891]  And it's just, it's just, it's like, please wake up.
[00:45:46.971 --> 00:45:47.892]  Please see what's happening.
[00:45:49.153 --> 00:45:56.481]  Parents angry over Michigan security drill.
[00:46:00.734 --> 00:46:09.779]  And in the article it talks about, they came in, and it's happened in Texas, and it's happened in, we've had the teachers on, we've had the lawyers on, it's happened in Minneapolis-St.
[00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:14.422]  Paul, they took the elementary kids out, the back of the school, so we're going to kill you in the forest.
[00:46:16.443 --> 00:46:19.425]  And I have to sit here and think, we're doing that to stop mass shootings.
[00:46:19.785 --> 00:46:21.386]  We've got to naked body scan you.
[00:46:21.426 --> 00:46:23.107]  We've got to take your blood at checkpoints.
[00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:27.650]  They want to get into your comfort zone, get into your space, train you, you have no privacy.
[00:46:32.759 --> 00:46:37.143]  This is psychological warfare, and it conditions the cops to do this.
[00:46:37.664 --> 00:46:38.945]  Everybody's being conditioned.
[00:46:40.766 --> 00:46:49.955]  All right, I'm gonna go to Jake, Tony, Muhammad, Pat, Darrell, and others before our guest gets on, and I have to get into all this free speech news and the rest of it, but I'll cover some of that with her.
[00:46:52.998 --> 00:46:56.261]  There it is, Michigan high school students terrorizing police state security drill.
[00:46:56.521 --> 00:46:57.382]  Is that five years old?
[00:47:00.188 --> 00:47:00.388]  It is.
[00:47:00.428 --> 00:47:02.129]  Okay, print it and it'll have an AP link in it.
[00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.371]  See if the AP link or search under that term.
[00:47:04.851 --> 00:47:05.712]  That's natural news.
[00:47:05.772 --> 00:47:06.533]  Great source of info.
[00:47:06.553 --> 00:47:07.954]  We want to show people actual AP.
[00:47:08.674 --> 00:47:09.655]  Splattering blood on them.
[00:47:09.675 --> 00:47:11.016]  Blowing a truck up in front of them.
[00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:13.578]  And again, you're tuning in going, this didn't happen.
[00:47:13.638 --> 00:47:14.218]  Yes, it did.
[00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:14.659]  Okay?
[00:47:14.939 --> 00:47:15.519]  Yes, it did.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:16.660]  Okay?
[00:47:17.261 --> 00:47:17.861]  That's my point.
[00:47:17.881 --> 00:47:18.682]  It's going on everywhere.
[00:47:20.503 --> 00:47:22.164]  They're taking their children away from you.
[00:47:22.544 --> 00:47:25.647]  If you did that to your kids, they'd take your kids away from you and arrest you and they should.
[00:47:26.584 --> 00:47:28.805]  You came in and said you were going to blow their head off, put a gun to their head.
[00:47:28.985 --> 00:47:32.607]  But they're training you that if you naked body scanned your kids, you'd get in trouble.
[00:47:32.647 --> 00:47:34.008]  But the state says they can do it.
[00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:38.950]  They're training the preachers to tell their flocks to go to FEMA camps.
[00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.191]  You cannot make this up.
[00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:42.052]  Now, I want to briefly go to Ted Anderson.
[00:47:42.072 --> 00:47:44.613]  I hope you listen up carefully because we're only going to spend a few minutes on this.
[00:47:46.014 --> 00:47:52.797]  The banks have done everything they can to drive gold down, but it's up, what, more than $10 in the last week.
[00:47:55.131 --> 00:47:56.992]  It's at $1,133.10.
[00:48:01.776 --> 00:48:08.080]  And Ted still has gold and silver he bought back when gold was at the $1,050 level.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.323]  And on top of it, he'll throw in a free international forecast for your subscription, $159 value.
[00:48:13.583 --> 00:48:19.687]  And the tiny amount of money he makes from this, because he bought at a lower price, sells it low when it's high, supports the network.
[00:48:19.968 --> 00:48:20.888]  You can't get a better deal.
[00:48:20.908 --> 00:48:22.810]  He's got a bunch of other coins he's offering.
[00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:24.771]  Ted, tell folks about today's offers.
[00:48:25.225 --> 00:48:25.705]  Yeah, sure.
[00:48:25.765 --> 00:48:28.226]  As a matter of fact, I can do even a little bit better.
[00:48:28.266 --> 00:48:31.667]  It was $261.61 last time I offered the franc.
[00:48:31.767 --> 00:48:32.567]  Gold is up.
[00:48:33.047 --> 00:48:36.088]  I've dropped my price on the franc down to $249.68.
[00:48:37.428 --> 00:48:39.789]  So the price of the franc is actually lower.
[00:48:39.809 --> 00:48:43.690]  It gets it down to $90.68 after you consider the $159 discount for the forecaster subscription.
[00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:52.074]  Total's $453.40 an ounce for gold.
[00:48:52.694 --> 00:48:57.217]  I mean, we're both looking at gold right now at $1,135 an ounce.
[00:48:57.738 --> 00:48:58.438]  That's a steal.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:08.946]  Unbelievable, the one-ounce Silver Sovereigns coming out of the Montana Silver People, they are selling like hotcakes right now, so I'd really recommend those.
[00:49:08.966 --> 00:49:10.347]  Get involved with those as well.
[00:49:11.487 --> 00:49:17.892]  When organizations stand up for liberty, people support it, and I'd really appreciate that.
[00:49:18.753 --> 00:49:22.876]  The British Sovereign is currently at $312.42.
[00:49:22.996 --> 00:49:24.337]  Again, that's a lower price.
[00:49:25.397 --> 00:49:34.563]  I picked up most of this stuff when gold was down there at that $1,083 level, and now we're looking at $1,135, so this is really a good buy.
[00:49:35.084 --> 00:49:41.708]  And I would suggest that people get involved, but really, if you haven't had a chance to get your economic newsletter subscription yet,
[00:49:42.228 --> 00:49:53.612]  That international forecaster is really good, and again, it's $159 for a year, but all you have to do is pick up the one franc for $249.68, and that's it.
[00:49:53.672 --> 00:49:55.152]  We'll buy it for you for a full year.
[00:49:56.793 --> 00:50:02.135]  Absolutely, but folks, I wouldn't just buy one fifth ounce franc and get the newsletter.
[00:50:02.155 --> 00:50:06.496]  I would get some of those other coins and offers in gold and silver, because they are fabulous deals.
[00:50:07.357 --> 00:50:08.497]  Every few months when I buy,
[00:50:09.781 --> 00:50:13.183]  A quarter ounce coin or something, or a couple silver coins.
[00:50:14.323 --> 00:50:16.144]  I get it from Ted Anderson, and I've shopped around.
[00:50:16.705 --> 00:50:21.808]  This is a wonderful deal, and he's a patriot, and he's been around for 30-plus years, Midas for more than 12.
[00:50:21.848 --> 00:50:21.888]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:21.908 --> 00:50:23.408]  800-686-2237, or MidasResources.com.
[00:50:23.428 --> 00:50:24.069]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:24.189 --> 00:50:25.329]  And to get those special deals,
[00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:40.298]  He was offering.
[00:50:40.898 --> 00:50:44.661]  You need to tell him Alex Jones sent you as part of his special to get that deal.
[00:50:44.681 --> 00:50:44.961]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:45.002 --> 00:50:50.446]  Here's the number again.
[00:50:50.466 --> 00:50:50.646]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:50.766 --> 00:50:54.449]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:50:54.749 --> 00:50:58.072]  Protect yourself from the bankers and their fiat currency and paper today.
[00:50:58.112 --> 00:50:58.693]  Thanks, Ted.
[00:50:59.952 --> 00:51:00.272]  Fact.
[00:51:00.292 --> 00:51:01.853]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:51:01.893 --> 00:51:03.694]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:51:04.014 --> 00:51:04.314]  Fact.
[00:51:04.534 --> 00:51:07.876]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:51:08.216 --> 00:51:08.536]  Fact.
[00:51:08.836 --> 00:51:14.139]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:51:14.339 --> 00:51:14.679]  Fact.
[00:51:15.039 --> 00:51:18.841]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:51:19.181 --> 00:51:19.501]  Fact.
[00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:23.443]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:51:59.446 --> 00:52:01.748]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:01.768 --> 00:52:04.050]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:06.952]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.352 --> 00:52:12.096]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.457 --> 00:52:16.660]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.302]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.422 --> 00:52:21.824]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:21.844 --> 00:52:24.766]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.107 --> 00:52:32.713]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.033 --> 00:52:38.297]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.437 --> 00:52:40.699]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:40.759 --> 00:52:44.722]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:44.982 --> 00:52:45.902]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.043 --> 00:52:47.283]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.404 --> 00:52:48.404]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:01.274 --> 00:54:12.740]  What the Feds do is, this is done all over the world, it's all globally standardized at the UN level, is they put out MYAC and Homeland Security reports demonizing homeschoolers, Christians, conservatives,
[00:54:13.953 --> 00:54:14.754]  Returning veterans.
[00:54:14.874 --> 00:54:18.917]  And then they go out and bust groups led by feds and send them to prison.
[00:54:19.798 --> 00:54:24.301]  And they just set them up to then have it on the news that a group was planning to attack a school.
[00:54:24.342 --> 00:54:26.603]  They were planning to attack a police station.
[00:54:26.643 --> 00:54:28.305]  They were planning to blow up the Capitol.
[00:54:29.806 --> 00:54:31.928]  And so this is part of reality management.
[00:54:32.708 --> 00:54:34.330]  But we did pull up the AP article.
[00:54:35.311 --> 00:54:38.073]  Michigan School District portrays homeschoolers as terrorists.
[00:54:39.591 --> 00:54:46.716]  A simulated attack by a fictitious radical group called Wackos against schools and education who believes everyone should be homeschooled.
[00:54:48.597 --> 00:54:55.662]  And actually, punch up the article from Infowars.com on screen for people, because that one has the AP parts excised out, so does this article.
[00:54:55.982 --> 00:54:58.824]  Or not excised, pulled out and added to our article.
[00:55:00.465 --> 00:55:04.048]  And it goes on, they came and blew up a car, told the kids it was real.
[00:55:05.494 --> 00:55:07.555]  It said homeschoolers were coming to kill the kids.
[00:55:07.595 --> 00:55:10.835]  It was part of a Homeland Security grant.
[00:55:11.596 --> 00:55:18.637]  The Muskogon Area Intermediate School District partnered with the Muskogon County Emergency Services as part of a Homeland Security grant.
[00:55:21.838 --> 00:55:24.899]  Michigan high school students terrorizing police state security drill.
[00:55:26.021 --> 00:55:34.545]  And here's the school's press release, Michigan.gov, school lockdown, shelter in place, drill policy, and it says we're going to continue this at all schools twice a year.
[00:55:35.426 --> 00:55:37.887]  This is after more complaints happened in January 9, 2007.
[00:55:38.407 --> 00:55:44.971]  Here's DynCorp running the CPS grabbing rings.
[00:55:45.011 --> 00:55:46.952]  DynCorp's been caught worldwide in child kidnapping.
[00:55:47.592 --> 00:55:50.773]  That's congressional reports, but they run things here in Texas.
[00:55:50.934 --> 00:55:52.794]  We're going to talk about that some coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:54.215 --> 00:55:55.736]  Yeah, it's not a game, is it?
[00:55:57.759 --> 00:55:59.461]  They think of you as a bunch of stupid monkeys.
[00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:00.762]  They can just program.
[00:56:01.163 --> 00:56:03.666]  But if you're conscious of the programming, you can break free from it.
[00:56:04.847 --> 00:56:06.689]  Let's talk to Jake in Wisconsin.
[00:56:06.709 --> 00:56:07.630]  Jake, you're on the air.
[00:56:08.411 --> 00:56:09.933]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[00:56:09.993 --> 00:56:10.914]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:56:11.555 --> 00:56:17.462]  I was calling to see if you have ever read the MSDS, or Material Safety Data Sheet, on sodium fluoride.
[00:56:18.533 --> 00:56:20.214]  Yes, they say it attacks all the organs.
[00:56:20.274 --> 00:56:21.614]  It's incredible deadly poison.
[00:56:21.634 --> 00:56:23.435]  If you get any of it in you, it's horrible.
[00:56:23.515 --> 00:56:24.595]  It's a cumulative poison.
[00:56:24.875 --> 00:56:28.097]  So even small exposures over time are incredibly hazardous.
[00:56:28.737 --> 00:56:30.077]  And that's why they put it in the water.
[00:56:30.637 --> 00:56:31.858]  But I mean, tell folks what it says.
[00:56:32.018 --> 00:56:32.658]  Tell folks what it says.
[00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:48.284]  Well, for those of you who don't know, a material safety data sheet on a job site or a warehouse or whatever, if you have chemicals, you have to have a material safety data sheet for any chemicals you have on site so the people know what to do with it.
[00:56:48.965 --> 00:56:52.066]  In case they come into contact or a spill happens, what have you.
[00:56:52.686 --> 00:57:13.510]  Okay, the first part is relatively benign, but when you get to the fourth page, section 11, it starts talking about toxicological information, roots of entry, inhalation and ingestion, mutagenic effects, mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells, mutagenic for bacteria,
[00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:28.713]  And by the way, the main mammalian cells are breast tissue and testicular tissue, because those have the highest fluctuation of hormone fluctuations, and so they target that.
[00:57:28.773 --> 00:57:31.635]  And if you read the literature, that's why it attacks your reproductive system.
[00:57:31.655 --> 00:57:31.955]  Go ahead.
[00:57:32.495 --> 00:57:37.678]  Yeah, they also have, page 5, special remarks on toxic effects on humans.
[00:57:38.439 --> 00:57:41.701]  And they have it broken down by organ systems.
[00:57:41.781 --> 00:57:43.322]  Skin causes skin irritation.
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.080]  Eyes.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.862]  Causes eye irritation and burns.
[00:57:46.743 --> 00:57:47.243]  Ingestion.
[00:57:47.303 --> 00:57:48.284]  Harmful or swallowed.
[00:57:48.704 --> 00:57:51.226]  Causes digestive tract irritation and burns.
[00:57:51.287 --> 00:57:54.249]  May cause severe and permanent damage to the digestive tract.
[00:57:54.890 --> 00:58:10.383]  Ingestion of large amounts may cause salivation, thirst, nausea, vomiting, hypermolatility, diarrhea, abdominal pain, behavioral, central nervous system damage, respiratory damage, cardiovascular system damage, liver, urinary,
[00:58:10.996 --> 00:58:13.623]  There is absolutely nothing here that it doesn't attack.
[00:58:14.104 --> 00:58:16.189]  It's just terrible and then they put it in our water.
[00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:19.898]  But if you spill some at work, you'd have to call a HAZMAT team.
[00:58:21.909 --> 00:58:23.369]  But we're conspiracy theorists.
[00:58:23.389 --> 00:58:26.170]  It doesn't matter if we have Russian, Nazi, and U.S.
[00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:30.251]  government documents where they say they put it in the water to sterilize and brain damage us.
[00:58:30.651 --> 00:58:31.611]  But the government's good.
[00:58:31.631 --> 00:58:32.771]  I'm glad they're running health care.
[00:58:32.791 --> 00:58:34.131]  They're going to take good care of us now.
[00:58:34.631 --> 00:58:37.512]  Come on, you shouldn't read that information.
[00:58:37.592 --> 00:58:38.832]  It's good for you.
[00:58:39.572 --> 00:58:44.653]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:45.293 --> 00:58:48.494]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:52.342]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:52.743 --> 00:58:57.705]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:58.066 --> 00:58:59.806]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:00.127 --> 00:59:04.949]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:05.129 --> 00:59:06.090]  How much do you want?
[00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:07.050]  When do you want it?
[00:59:07.431 --> 00:59:09.032]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:10.132]  When will you need it?
[00:59:10.392 --> 00:59:12.453]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:12.593 --> 00:59:13.694]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:13.934 --> 00:59:15.235]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:15.455 --> 00:59:20.520]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.903]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:24.304 --> 00:59:27.807]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:28.127 --> 00:59:29.108]  How much will you need?
[00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.949]  We don't know.
[00:59:30.249 --> 00:59:31.170]  How much do you want?
[00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:32.091]  All you can get.
[00:59:32.291 --> 00:59:32.872]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:33.352 --> 00:59:36.134]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:36.414 --> 00:59:36.774]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[00:59:39.656 --> 00:59:40.796]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:40.836 --> 00:59:42.657]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.722]  It's already the final hour.
[01:00:06.842 --> 01:00:10.525]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[01:00:11.006 --> 01:00:18.673]  Katherine Austen-Fitz, talking about the economy, the police state, the New World Order, the nature of the elites, is coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:20.714 --> 01:00:22.196]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls.
[01:00:22.276 --> 01:00:23.837]  Tony in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:00:25.979 --> 01:00:26.260]  Hello?
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.160]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:27.781 --> 01:00:28.622]  Hey, how you doing, boss?
[01:00:29.142 --> 01:00:29.463]  All right.
[01:00:30.483 --> 01:00:31.024]  Ah, perfect.
[01:00:31.859 --> 01:00:36.883]  I was doing a lot of research over the past year because of all the information you guys have been providing.
[01:00:36.923 --> 01:00:38.405]  Of course, everybody's thankful for that.
[01:00:38.825 --> 01:00:39.626]  We do appreciate it.
[01:00:40.386 --> 01:00:49.954]  But I haven't been hearing a lot of information about security companies like Converse Technology and Verint and Nice Systems, as well as Norris.
[01:00:50.114 --> 01:01:00.303]  Well, they're a revolving door in homeland security, and it's the same in Europe, where when somebody's in homeland security, they give them the contracts, and then five years later, they move into that company as an executive.
[01:01:01.167 --> 01:01:24.603]  Absolutely, and one of the biggest issues is that Congress, the headquarters is in Israel, as well as all these other sub-companies or umbrella companies like Verint and Norris and all these other companies, but they have contracts now with American telecom communication companies, and now each and every single telephone across North America is linked to Israeli intelligence through this system, because it's all in the back of Congress.
[01:01:24.623 --> 01:01:25.444]  That's been for 10 years.
[01:01:26.363 --> 01:01:28.164]  That's been for 10 years, absolutely.
[01:01:28.524 --> 01:01:30.045]  Because then they can get around U.S.
[01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:35.428]  laws because a foreign government is doing the spying and then giving it back to the NSA.
[01:01:36.049 --> 01:01:39.791]  They claim it doesn't get around the law, it just hides the criminality.
[01:01:40.768 --> 01:01:41.969]  No, exactly, exactly.
[01:01:42.249 --> 01:02:01.159]  And if you do your research far enough, it leaks all the way back down to Sourcefire, which their major clients are American Defense Department, the National Security Department, and a lot of these people think that when they go online and they think that they're safe through these security companies, but one of the major companies that I found that was connected to these things is VeriSign.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.502]  Now, VeriSign deals with most of the, majority of the credit card securities.
[01:02:06.082 --> 01:02:11.624]  And the government can raise up the tech companies they want to be preeminent by giving them the contracts.
[01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:12.324]  Great point, Tony.
[01:02:12.364 --> 01:02:14.024]  Mohammed in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:50.047]  Hey, so I don't know if anybody mentioned this on the Friday or Sunday show, but I just went to go see the new Clash of the Titans movie yesterday, and unlike the 80s show that's all about some dude that's left-struck and going to fight things,
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.886]  This one, to me, was really almost like an allegory for the current state of the U.S.
[01:02:56.046 --> 01:03:06.697]  In the movie, you've got these titans that are defeated by their sons, the gods, and the gods make people, human beings, to pray to them in order for them to live forever.
[01:03:07.615 --> 01:03:18.198]  And so the people become very distraught with the tyranny of the Titans and kind of rebel, and so they release this Kraken that's supposed to kind of put the people back in check.
[01:03:18.338 --> 01:03:22.680]  And halfway through the movie, I immediately thought, you know, this is kind of like the U.S.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.261]  You've got... Yeah, Ben Laden is the Kraken.
[01:03:25.901 --> 01:03:26.401]  Absolutely.
[01:03:26.561 --> 01:03:27.161]  Right?
[01:03:27.821 --> 01:03:29.042]  Release the Kraken.
[01:03:31.288 --> 01:03:46.995]  You've got people who fled from England, the tyranny in England, and so these are represented by the gods, and so the gods set up a government for the people, and you're supposed to pay your taxes to the government.
[01:03:47.295 --> 01:03:59.160]  And right now, in the current state, the government's becoming tyrannical, and so people are just kind of taking a stand, saying, no, no, we're not going to really put up with this tyranny, and so the government's like, release the Kraken, you know, onto the people.
[01:04:00.164 --> 01:04:05.666]  And so, halfway through the movie, I really just started to realize, you know, this is really almost about America.
[01:04:05.686 --> 01:04:18.609]  Well, George Lucas said that episode three, Revenge of the Sith, is where the senator becomes the president, then the ruler, by staging terror attacks and outside military attacks on himself.
[01:04:18.949 --> 01:04:23.911]  And many of the terrorist armies he's running don't even know that they're not really going to win in the end.
[01:04:25.491 --> 01:04:28.772]  And Lucas said, no, no, this is what our government really does do.
[01:04:29.372 --> 01:04:30.813]  He's definitely a 9-11 truther.
[01:04:31.814 --> 01:04:33.435]  So, absolutely, that's what's going on.
[01:04:34.636 --> 01:04:35.797]  Yeah, so I just wanted to throw that out there.
[01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:40.421]  Anybody that wants to take a moment and relieve yourself of some stress... Was it a good movie overall?
[01:04:41.502 --> 01:04:42.543]  Overall, it was a pretty good movie.
[01:04:42.963 --> 01:04:46.626]  And that message, that allegory, is very overt.
[01:04:46.646 --> 01:04:48.668]  So it doesn't take a lot of digging to really realize that.
[01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.049]  So it's worth checking out.
[01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.589]  It's entertaining.
[01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:55.533]  Well, I don't watch a lot of films, but I may have to go watch it so we can do a review here.
[01:04:55.553 --> 01:04:57.715]  Plus, I like escapism occasionally.
[01:04:59.278 --> 01:05:00.539]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:00.579 --> 01:05:05.925]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:06.165 --> 01:05:10.810]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.591]  It's true.
[01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:16.236]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:05:16.756 --> 01:05:21.461]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:21.981 --> 01:05:28.908]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:29.108 --> 01:05:30.009]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:30.229 --> 01:05:36.595]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:36.895 --> 01:05:39.737]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:40.078 --> 01:05:41.979]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:42.299 --> 01:05:43.240]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:43.560]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.403]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:46.903 --> 01:05:48.624]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:00.831 --> 01:06:04.452]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:12.914]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:13.655 --> 01:06:17.696]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:18.296 --> 01:06:29.099]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:29.739 --> 01:06:38.742]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:39.242 --> 01:06:44.284]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:44.684 --> 01:06:51.867]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:52.167 --> 01:06:54.908]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:06:59.742 --> 01:07:03.004]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:16.252 --> 01:07:22.554]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:22.935 --> 01:07:28.497]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:32.698]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:07:33.098 --> 01:07:37.120]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.161]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[01:07:40.581 --> 01:07:43.062]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:43.322 --> 01:07:46.263]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:48.283]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:48.843 --> 01:07:49.363]  It's here.

[01:08:04.827 --> 01:08:07.128]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:18.713 --> 01:08:22.195]  Well, for the balance of the hour, Kathryn Austin Fitts is our guest.
[01:08:22.215 --> 01:08:26.879]  We're going to cover a whole host of different issues with her today.
[01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:37.806]  She's with Solari.com Investment Advisor, founder and managing member of Solari Investment Advisory Services, LLC.
[01:08:37.826 --> 01:08:40.628]  It's spelled S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:45.151]  Kathryn has designed and closed over $25 billion of transactions and investments
[01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:51.295]  To date, and has led portfolio strategy for $300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[01:08:51.335 --> 01:08:55.078]  We recently interviewed her for her upcoming film, Fall of the Republic 2.
[01:08:55.779 --> 01:08:58.000]  Catherine's experiences on Wall Street and Washington, D.C.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.864]  are chronicled in Dylan Reed and the Aristocracy of Stock Portfolios.
[01:09:03.585 --> 01:09:15.174]  She's also a former government official, Assistant Secretary of Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1, Investment Banker, Managing Director and member of the board of Wall Street firm Dylan Reed & Co, Inc.
[01:09:15.994 --> 01:09:17.774]  And so it doesn't get any more elite than that.
[01:09:18.215 --> 01:09:21.255]  And she joins us for the next 51 minutes here today.
[01:09:21.955 --> 01:09:23.196]  Catherine, out of the gates.
[01:09:23.736 --> 01:09:28.557]  We're going to get into government health care and your take on what it does.
[01:09:29.337 --> 01:09:31.858]  But I first wanted to go to this Businessweek article.
[01:09:32.398 --> 01:09:35.339]  FDIC wants pension funds to prop up failed banks.
[01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:38.079]  And in fact, this isn't the Bloomberg.
[01:09:38.099 --> 01:09:38.539]  This is the
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:41.900]  Raw story.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.621]  I want the Bloomberg or Businessweek.
[01:09:43.641 --> 01:09:44.661]  I want to show people that one.
[01:09:45.521 --> 01:09:46.721]  This is basically the same article.
[01:09:46.741 --> 01:09:48.262]  I mean, here's a link to the Bloomberg News.
[01:09:48.542 --> 01:09:59.264]  I wanted to read the actual quotes where they're ordering, with this color of law, kind of like they ordered the banks to take the bailout, wink wink, to invest public and private pension funds, quote, in failed banks.
[01:10:00.265 --> 01:10:02.145]  Catherine Austin Fitz, what is all that about?
[01:10:03.005 --> 01:10:09.447]  Well, we have seen the pension funds over the last 10 to 20 years come under significant pressure
[01:10:10.208 --> 01:10:14.692]  To invest in a variety of things which have left the pension funds in real trouble.
[01:10:15.593 --> 01:10:17.214]  So we have the pension funds.
[01:10:17.274 --> 01:10:26.102]  The pension funds, the American pension funds, were the key vehicle used to finance the housing bubble and have gotten, you know, left holding the bag.
[01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:35.150]  And so it is incredibly important, Alex, that pension funds have the legal protection and authority to finance
[01:10:35.953 --> 01:10:37.955]  You know, what is the right thing to do?
[01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:49.864]  And if there's one reform that needs to happen, it's a real investigation of why do the pension funds keep doing, you know, the scams and how do you stop that?
[01:10:50.684 --> 01:10:58.270]  Because it's left, you know, we now have state and local governments and companies having to come up with new big pension fund payments because
[01:10:58.939 --> 01:11:01.700]  There's been too much political interference.
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:13.823]  I described... You've heard me tell the story where the president of the largest pension fund in the country, CalPERS, said to me in 1997 when I was trying to interest him in refinancing American communities, he said, it's too late.
[01:11:13.843 --> 01:11:14.503]  You don't understand.
[01:11:14.523 --> 01:11:15.563]  They've given up on the country.
[01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:17.984]  They're moving all the money out starting in the fall.
[01:11:18.604 --> 01:11:21.465]  You know, and my question is, you know, well, who's they?
[01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:25.986]  And how can they order you as a pension fund board to just
[01:11:26.926 --> 01:11:42.329]  You know, do things with your money, and the reality is, if CalPERS had invested in the fundamental infrastructure and well-being of American communities and American infrastructure, they would have lost a lot less money.
[01:11:43.171 --> 01:11:45.573]  You know, instead of losing it on the pump and dump.
[01:11:45.693 --> 01:11:50.177]  And we would have an infrastructure and a nation, but this is predatory.
[01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:58.284]  And again, you were there at the top of the pyramid watching this happen, trying to stop it on record, even at the time.
[01:11:58.324 --> 01:12:08.453]  So to be clear, we have the head NASA climatologist, we have the UN, we have all these world leaders, Bill Gates saying they want to destroy industrial society so they get you in debt.
[01:12:09.013 --> 01:12:13.437]  Get your local governments, pension funds, police, fire, you name it, to invest.
[01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:21.465]  They move it all offshore, then the country implodes, and then they come in with even more debt, then they take over health care, then they run your life.
[01:12:21.485 --> 01:12:21.825]  Go ahead.
[01:12:21.865 --> 01:12:24.348]  Right, so then they say your pension funds have lost all this money.
[01:12:24.408 --> 01:12:26.870]  Now, what's the FDIC up to?
[01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:32.235]  The last person who should be telling the pension funds what they should invest in is the FDIC.
[01:12:32.275 --> 01:12:33.196]  Now, I say that
[01:12:33.812 --> 01:12:44.658]  And Alex, what you need to know is, you know, the patterns appear that lots of small banks are being targeted in a way that's ending up providing subsidy to the people who pick them up.
[01:12:44.999 --> 01:13:01.328]  In other words, we have a double standard in enforcement by the banking regulators so the big banks who've been doing all the improper things get bailed out and the small banks who've been well-managed are getting targeted and taken over in a way that subsidized the big banks.
[01:13:02.057 --> 01:13:12.360]  So you have to be careful behind here, you know, that we don't see the FDIC driving the small banks into pension funds in a way that is part of an economic warfare game.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:22.823]  And my fear is, you know, the next thing you know, you see state and local government pension funds financing someone like Soros or the big hedge fund operators picking up these small banks for cheap.
[01:13:24.088 --> 01:13:24.689]  Absolutely.
[01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:26.790]  So that's why I brought this article up first.
[01:13:27.591 --> 01:13:31.274]  And I want you to spend some more time on this before we get into some other related issues.
[01:13:32.714 --> 01:13:52.927]  Here they are, in Businessweek, in Bloomberg, saying, and Obama's people are now out there pushing this, that, oh, we're going to just take your pension funds wholesale to protect them, and then of course they'll invest those in derivatives again, then they'll take a large portion of it down the road, get people more dependent on government.
[01:13:53.007 --> 01:13:57.850]  Well, we did take most of it, but, you know, you've got to stick with us or you won't get any of it.
[01:13:59.913 --> 01:14:01.254]  Here's the question.
[01:14:01.654 --> 01:14:08.598]  Should capital be allocated according to, one, the preferences of the people who are either responsible, own it, or control it?
[01:14:09.258 --> 01:14:14.301]  Two, according to economic performance, i.e., you know, what's the best investment?
[01:14:14.361 --> 01:14:22.986]  Or three, should it be channeled according to government dictates to a few small investors that allow them to control and own everything?
[01:14:24.721 --> 01:14:25.802]  Well, let me stop you again.
[01:14:26.082 --> 01:14:26.582]  Exactly.
[01:14:26.642 --> 01:14:34.128]  It sounds good that in the banking bill, the government is now officially in the banking business.
[01:14:34.908 --> 01:14:41.112]  Slipped into it was a student loan legislation where the government will now be the person loaning.
[01:14:41.132 --> 01:14:47.437]  But really, it'll be the government directing you to specific top three or four banks.
[01:14:47.477 --> 01:14:49.678]  So this is a vertical integration.
[01:14:49.799 --> 01:14:51.360]  And I want to be clear here for new listeners.
[01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:54.743]  The government controls the regulators.
[01:14:54.763 --> 01:15:01.364]  They can arrest or set up or shut down or sanction any pension fund manager that doesn't do what they're told.
[01:15:01.384 --> 01:15:14.607]  And here they are in Bloomberg, openly telling the federal government, run by private banks at the top, telling the pension fund controllers, you will invest with us, quote, in failed banks.
[01:15:14.627 --> 01:15:18.768]  So this is the government completely taking over society.
[01:15:18.828 --> 01:15:20.929]  Break down how serious this is.
[01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:22.189]  The Soviet Union.
[01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:24.170]  But here's what you've got.
[01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:29.493]  Let's say your neighbor, Alex, is an insider, and you are an outsider.
[01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:34.735]  And your insider neighborhood plays ball with the government.
[01:15:34.876 --> 01:15:36.336]  And the government says, you know something?
[01:15:36.956 --> 01:15:41.199]  You can finance your car for zero percent, which is what hedge fund operators have been doing.
[01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:42.399]  They've been on the carry trade.
[01:15:42.419 --> 01:15:44.220]  They've been borrowing for zero to one percent.
[01:15:45.398 --> 01:15:58.468]  And your neighbor can finance his car with 0% financing, he can finance his mortgage with 0% financing, and we're going to provide equity financing to his business for 2%.
[01:15:58.568 --> 01:16:10.417]  Meantime, you have to pay 5% for your car financing, 6% for your mortgage financing, and by the way, you can't get equity for your business, but you can borrow at the bank for 12% if you can get somebody to guarantee you.
[01:16:10.997 --> 01:16:14.160]  Okay, now, how long is it going to take before your neighbor has
[01:16:14.912 --> 01:16:20.115]  You know, a much bigger car, a much bigger house, and has bought your business, you know, that went bankrupt.
[01:16:21.756 --> 01:16:28.519]  And if you... And if you won't... We're talking about controlling it through the back door by controlling the cost of capital.
[01:16:28.599 --> 01:16:34.423]  And certain players get a very low or even free or negative cost of capital.
[01:16:34.443 --> 01:16:37.444]  So I'm a bank every time I lose... I'm a big bank every time I lose money.
[01:16:37.464 --> 01:16:39.545]  You just replenish what I lost.
[01:16:40.086 --> 01:16:44.308]  Whereas the rest of us have real risk, and we have to pay
[01:16:45.211 --> 01:16:50.272]  A much higher cost of capital than we would if we could just, you know, if there was a real market.
[01:16:51.793 --> 01:17:03.636]  And if you won't sell your business to them, they put in the green economy, which is run by government, they will selectively force you to sell your business or they will shut you down.
[01:17:04.616 --> 01:17:10.058]  Well, there's thousands of ways it happens, but there's a double standard in terms of regulatory enforcement.
[01:17:10.618 --> 01:17:14.419]  So, for example, you know, I used to have a broker-dealer that was a small company.
[01:17:15.094 --> 01:17:23.742]  And before I'd worked on Wall Street, and if you look at the enforcement costs and time that we spent as a small business, it was significantly greater.
[01:17:26.244 --> 01:17:27.705]  But there are double standards.
[01:17:28.266 --> 01:17:33.851]  Now, let me describe behind this what one of the legitimate problems is.
[01:17:35.792 --> 01:17:37.354]  We have a real problem
[01:17:38.155 --> 01:17:41.876]  In that, right now, the financial markets have two goals.
[01:17:42.497 --> 01:17:49.219]  You know, the goal you're taught in business school is the goal of the financial markets is to allocate capital to the most efficient players.
[01:17:49.299 --> 01:18:00.823]  And so, you know, some companies are efficient, and they make money, and so they attract you, you buy their stock, as opposed to the big bank that has the derivative method goes bankrupt, right?
[01:18:01.364 --> 01:18:03.304]  So, one is the allocation of capital.
[01:18:03.384 --> 01:18:05.005]  The other, increasingly, Alex,
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.682]  Is geopolitical economic warfare.
[01:18:07.722 --> 01:18:15.989]  You know, we've gone from a planet where wars occur with bombs to where wars occur with derivative bombs.
[01:18:16.289 --> 01:18:26.017]  And you're literally seeing a geopolitical competition between the Chinese, the Russians, and populations around the globe for resources.
[01:18:26.727 --> 01:18:42.500]  Through the capital markets, and so the national security goals of manipulating the futures market or the price of oil or the price of gold have literally overtaken, you know, the goal of using the markets for whatever.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:51.848]  And part of what you're seeing with all the goal of the capital controls is literally, if you're the government, you can't afford for people to be making a free market.
[01:18:52.569 --> 01:18:58.311]  You need the 20 mules to go in this direction, because that's what you need to manage the Chinese.
[01:18:59.052 --> 01:19:04.754]  And so you have this incredible desire for control, including for a legitimate reason.
[01:19:04.794 --> 01:19:06.194]  And let me tell you what the problem is.
[01:19:06.234 --> 01:19:17.979]  You and I have talked many times about the red button problem, which is everybody in America, right now, we are all the beneficiary of this geopolitical effort.
[01:19:18.279 --> 01:19:21.160]  So tomorrow, if the geopolitics stop,
[01:19:21.869 --> 01:19:23.390]  Yeah, I saw that in the New York Times.
[01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:23.990]  Stay there.
[01:19:24.011 --> 01:19:26.772]  And again, I've been interrupting a few times because
[01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:53.802]  It's so incredible to see them openly saying they're going to take over the pension funds.
[01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:57.408]  We're going to break down where this is going when we come back.
[01:19:57.448 --> 01:19:57.949]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.246 --> 01:20:01.848]  Times are tough, and you gotta stretch that dollar.

[01:23:50.578 --> 01:23:53.401]  I want you to listen very carefully to Kathryn Austin Fitch.
[01:23:53.421 --> 01:23:55.183]  I want her to go back over.
[01:24:08.325 --> 01:24:10.827]  The information she just laid on us and expand on it.
[01:24:11.648 --> 01:24:13.089]  They get you dependent on government.
[01:24:13.129 --> 01:24:17.213]  They take your pension funds, your investment, your tax money for the infrastructure.
[01:24:17.233 --> 01:24:19.195]  They put it in offshore banks and derivatives.
[01:24:19.815 --> 01:24:21.577]  That bankrupts people by design.
[01:24:21.877 --> 01:24:26.081]  Then they come back and say we need even more money and more taxes to prop all this up.
[01:24:26.121 --> 01:24:29.384]  When you hear it's for the geopolitical purposes of the U.S.
[01:24:29.444 --> 01:24:32.407]  and England and Europe, that's the private banking arms.
[01:24:32.507 --> 01:24:34.288]  They're feeding on us, but they get us
[01:24:34.949 --> 01:24:38.812]  Tied into their system where we can't live with it or without it.
[01:24:39.312 --> 01:24:41.694]  And now it's coming towards a consolidation phase.
[01:24:41.714 --> 01:24:49.400]  They're going to use phony environmentalism to bring in a form of neo serfdom or feudalism to control our lives.
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:57.026]  And now they're showing their true hand, ordering the pension funds to give their money to the private banks.
[01:24:58.854 --> 01:25:05.677]  Catherine Austen, this is a short segment, but please elaborate on the point that you were making.
[01:25:07.317 --> 01:25:08.718]  Oh, now Alex, you got me.
[01:25:10.098 --> 01:25:17.701]  I had just finished making the point about the red button, and the extent to which we are financially dependent
[01:25:18.507 --> 01:25:18.687]  I don't
[01:25:36.562 --> 01:25:51.510]  Geopolitical warfare and the fact that our currency is very subsidized and the red button story is a story I tell where I ask an audience of people who will push the red button if it'll stop all hard narcotics traffic in their community tomorrow and out of an audience of 100
[01:25:52.717 --> 01:25:53.078]  I think so.
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:16.549]  In this warfare model, and so the question for all of us is, you know, nobody wants the top guys to push the red button because they're afraid.
[01:26:16.569 --> 01:26:24.478]  And as long as we're afraid to push the red button or to engage in a conversation about, you know, okay, how do we turn it green?
[01:26:24.498 --> 01:26:26.200]  How do we make it financially attractive?
[01:26:26.758 --> 01:26:35.963]  Then what happens is we go along, and I can say it today, you know, that they are doing this, but the reality is, Alex, that we are supporting them.
[01:26:36.163 --> 01:26:43.767]  If you look at the implementation of all of the sort of police state things, those things are being supported at the local level.
[01:26:43.827 --> 01:26:46.188]  I mean, I've watched all these things get implemented.
[01:26:46.846 --> 01:26:53.192]  Time after time after time, and it's, you know, there's always a group of local people who are helping promote it.
[01:26:53.372 --> 01:26:54.093]  It's frightening.
[01:26:54.273 --> 01:26:57.036]  And so, you know, but they're doing it because it makes the money.
[01:26:59.861 --> 01:27:03.364]  But to boil it down, we're coming to the end.
[01:27:03.724 --> 01:27:11.190]  The banks know they've pumped up the Ponzi scheme to such a level that they're now preparing to rob whatever wealth we've got left.
[01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:16.674]  And you talked about how the elites for the last decade have been leaving the United States.
[01:27:16.694 --> 01:27:27.682]  They're not coming to the end, because if you look at the wealth that this planet can create and harvest, the amount of wealth that's been created and can be harvested
[01:27:28.164 --> 01:27:31.020]  To date, it's tiny compared to what you could do in the next 20 or 30 years.
[01:27:32.219 --> 01:27:41.003]  So they've just, you know, this is far, we're on a journey and the wealth that can be created is far more than exists to date or have.
[01:27:41.303 --> 01:27:42.583]  Well, Catherine, you misunderstand.
[01:27:42.643 --> 01:27:42.983]  Hold on.
[01:27:43.023 --> 01:27:44.144]  You misunderstand what I'm saying.
[01:27:44.264 --> 01:27:44.584]  Okay.
[01:27:44.644 --> 01:27:58.149]  They are artificially cutting the avenues of wealth off to independent groups and smaller organizations and vertically integrating it and saying they want to cut wealth generation off to people in the West.
[01:27:58.269 --> 01:27:59.490]  I know they got us addicted.
[01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:00.130]  Right.
[01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:12.600]  In North America, their attitude is, listen, if you all just sit up, sit down, shut up, you know, we put an implant on you and you live on $600 of government subsidy a month, it'll make it much easier for us to manage the planet.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.361]  You've created a huge amount of wealth.
[01:28:14.401 --> 01:28:15.342]  We just stole it all.
[01:28:15.362 --> 01:28:22.788]  You're going to be real unhappy about that, so we just want you to sit in the corner and shut up, because, you know, we're on to the next thing.
[01:28:22.948 --> 01:28:23.308]  Bye.
[01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:25.790]  And what is the next thing?
[01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:26.751]  What is the next thing?
[01:28:27.332 --> 01:28:30.995]  Well, the next thing is they go to a global economy and a global government.
[01:28:31.015 --> 01:28:36.258]  In other words, the people managing this in the United States don't see themselves as Americans anymore.
[01:28:37.079 --> 01:28:38.560]  They see themselves as globalists.
[01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:47.286]  And they're managing to a global operation, and in fact, if you look at where their big investments are, their big investments are in space.
[01:28:48.147 --> 01:28:53.711]  So in fact, you know, they're not necessarily even looking at planet Earth as the 100% base of operations.
[01:28:57.181 --> 01:29:09.476]  But they have fantastic new technology, and they have a global framework, and their attitude is, we've moved on, you're left behind, and the question is how to manage the endgame.
[01:29:11.033 --> 01:29:11.553]  I agree.
[01:29:11.693 --> 01:29:16.315]  Now when we come back with Katherine Austin-Fitz, I want you to elaborate on what their endgame is.
[01:29:17.015 --> 01:29:20.457]  And we were talking during the last break, you were saying there are ways to stop this.
[01:29:20.837 --> 01:29:23.298]  We want to get your perspective on that.
[01:29:23.378 --> 01:29:26.579]  Katherine Austin-Fitz is our guest.
[01:29:27.139 --> 01:29:30.941]  We really appreciate her being on the radio broadcast with us today.
[01:29:30.961 --> 01:29:35.683]  We'll give you her website as well when we come back after this quick break.
[01:29:35.723 --> 01:29:38.604]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:39.687 --> 01:29:41.208]  We're talking about reality here.
[01:29:41.789 --> 01:29:48.194]  Not the baseball game, not the latest cosmetics, not acting cool to your neighbors, but life and death, freedom and slavery.
[01:29:49.535 --> 01:29:52.518]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.459 --> 01:29:56.141]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.366 --> 01:30:04.829]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:06.010 --> 01:30:10.773]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:11.133 --> 01:30:17.918]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:19.879 --> 01:30:22.080]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:23.942 --> 01:30:26.203]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:32.241]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:30:32.962 --> 01:30:36.103]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:30:36.783 --> 01:30:37.583]  Others don't.
[01:30:38.023 --> 01:30:39.924]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:40.164 --> 01:30:41.665]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:41.945 --> 01:30:44.505]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:44.846 --> 01:30:51.088]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:51.468 --> 01:30:53.669]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:54.169 --> 01:30:56.209]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:30:56.530 --> 01:30:57.050]  Others don't.
[01:30:59.591 --> 01:31:01.894]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:31:01.914 --> 01:31:04.197]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:31:04.297 --> 01:31:07.101]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:31:07.522 --> 01:31:12.268]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:31:12.628 --> 01:31:16.814]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:31:17.114 --> 01:31:19.476]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:31:19.576 --> 01:31:21.997]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:31:22.017 --> 01:31:24.919]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:31:25.259 --> 01:31:32.864]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:31:33.204 --> 01:31:38.469]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:31:38.589 --> 01:31:40.872]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:44.896]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:31:45.136 --> 01:31:46.057]  And I got news for you.
[01:31:46.217 --> 01:31:47.498]  You're everyone else.
[01:31:47.558 --> 01:31:48.579]  Invisible Empire.

[01:31:58.812 --> 01:31:59.433]  Hi, everyone.
[01:31:59.613 --> 01:32:00.474]  Andy Anderson here.
[01:32:00.674 --> 01:32:04.917]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[01:32:05.078 --> 01:32:10.743]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[01:32:10.863 --> 01:32:15.126]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[01:32:15.206 --> 01:32:16.908]  No more protection till you use it again.
[01:32:17.068 --> 01:32:18.228]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[01:32:18.409 --> 01:32:22.750]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.

[01:32:56.259 --> 01:32:56.679]  This is the end.
[01:33:06.977 --> 01:33:09.458]  Catherine Austen Fitz is our guest.
[01:33:09.478 --> 01:33:12.139]  We're talking about the most important subject there is.
[01:33:12.159 --> 01:33:17.061]  The global government, the elite, their mindset, how they control the planet, where they're going.
[01:33:20.802 --> 01:33:26.104]  Again, Catherine Austen Fitz is a former Assistant Secretary of Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1.
[01:33:26.824 --> 01:33:30.146]  The website is solari.com.
[01:33:32.046 --> 01:33:33.187]  Excellent info up there.
[01:33:34.986 --> 01:33:48.874]  Okay, I'm gonna try to just sit back and give you the floor because I want you to give people the overview of who we're dealing with, what their endgame is, what the next phase of their operations is going to be, and how we stop them, how we get out of this trap of being dependent on them.
[01:33:48.914 --> 01:33:55.298]  You notice all they ever want to do is get us more dependent so that there's basically no way to get away from these people.
[01:33:55.698 --> 01:33:55.878]  Right.
[01:33:57.045 --> 01:34:03.346]  Well, you know, it's a big series of about a thousand questions, but let me just start.
[01:34:03.366 --> 01:34:09.267]  Because I think I used to have a pastor in Washington who used to say, if we can fix it, God can fix it.
[01:34:09.567 --> 01:34:17.769]  And a lot of the solutions accelerate, Alex, the day that everyone sits back and says, you know, these guys are nuts, as Alex Jones says they are.
[01:34:19.269 --> 01:34:23.930]  Because all this stuff about slavery and police state, you know, those are reasonable words.
[01:34:24.508 --> 01:34:25.728]  That is where they're going.
[01:34:25.928 --> 01:34:37.692]  And, you know, I say this as a former regulator, a former assistant secretary of housing, a former board member of a Wall Street firm, a former board member of Sallie Mae, the student loan finance organization.
[01:34:38.392 --> 01:34:40.572]  And let me tell you how I came to that conclusion.
[01:34:42.653 --> 01:34:45.774]  Part of my background is doing portfolio strategy.
[01:34:47.395 --> 01:34:52.882]  You know, I was the FHA Commissioner, so doing portfolio strategy for $300 billion of liabilities.
[01:34:53.483 --> 01:35:04.096]  And then my company in Washington, the Hamilton Securities Group, built databases of all, you know, sort of community assets and real estate, which is looking at the entire GNP.
[01:35:05.006 --> 01:35:11.267]  And then when we compared it to certain things in the securities and global markets, you're talking about the GNP of the planet.
[01:35:11.807 --> 01:35:16.869]  So I'm used to dealing in very large numbers and actuarial analysis.
[01:35:16.889 --> 01:35:22.950]  And actuarially analysis says, well, if you stop feeding people GMO food, they're going to live longer.
[01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:27.911]  That means insurance companies are going to have to pay out this much more, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:35:28.706 --> 01:35:36.451]  So you're used to dealing in very big numbers and the butterfly effect of changes in policy with changes in lifespan.
[01:35:36.491 --> 01:35:38.172]  So I give that as a background.
[01:35:38.813 --> 01:35:40.654]  And I wrote this in the article I wrote.
[01:35:40.974 --> 01:35:45.897]  I wrote an essay about why I was opposed to the swine flu vaccination.
[01:35:46.658 --> 01:35:53.162]  And I literally, when I saw the policies that were being implemented in connection with the rollout of the WTO,
[01:35:54.002 --> 01:36:04.589]  And the control of agribusiness worldwide, the rounding up of innocent people in American communities and stuffed into prison and the private prison property.
[01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:21.421]  I went through all the different trends from 96 to 98, and I came to the conclusion, sort of back of the envelope, that the only thing I could conclude was that the leadership as a policy was planning on very significant depopulation worldwide.
[01:36:21.997 --> 01:36:38.145]  That was the only way I could explain, you know, the 20 policies I was seeing being implemented both here and globally with the WTO, particularly the control of the food supply and system with sort of what Monsanto is doing in genetically modified food.
[01:36:38.745 --> 01:36:44.248]  And I was very quiet about it at the time, you know, because I knew other people couldn't fathom what I was saying.
[01:36:44.268 --> 01:36:45.989]  And I remember in 1998 or 99,
[01:36:49.116 --> 01:36:56.378]  A very, very savvy portfolio strategist from the financial community called me up and said, can you have lunch with me?
[01:36:56.418 --> 01:36:57.578]  I'm going to be in Washington.
[01:36:57.698 --> 01:37:05.460]  And we went to lunch at Union Station and he looked at me and he said, you know, he said, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I've done the analysis.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:13.523]  And if you look at the changes in policies that are being rolled out over the last four years, the only thing I can conclude is they're planning on significant depopulation.
[01:37:14.043 --> 01:37:16.043]  And I said, well, that's what my analysis shows.
[01:37:16.643 --> 01:37:18.404]  And we just kind of stared at each other.
[01:37:19.281 --> 01:37:35.512]  And if you look across the board at what is being done in terms of building databases on American citizens, what is being done with RFID, is it RFID or RFDI?
[01:37:36.112 --> 01:37:39.454]  Well, they've got a bunch of different ones, but let me just stop you for a moment.
[01:37:39.614 --> 01:37:39.914]  Okay.
[01:37:40.435 --> 01:37:46.819]  Because you did, as this huge actuary analyst running hundreds of millions of dollars, you saw it.
[01:37:48.843 --> 01:37:56.567]  Like if somebody sees a guy pull up in a van and start chasing a house and then check in the front door you think maybe they're about to try to rob us.
[01:37:57.328 --> 01:38:05.052]  I have been at the guy's house as a fly on the wall and heard him talk about how he's going to rob and so separately
[01:38:05.652 --> 01:38:06.973]  And of course you know all this now.
[01:38:07.113 --> 01:38:22.365]  It turns out for 50 years they've been planning this and building a world government as a means to an end and all of the tracking, all of the surveillance, all the police state, all the mind control, the conditioning is to be rolled out in phases and we're now coming into the endgame.
[01:38:22.585 --> 01:38:25.908]  You're coming in to literally kill 80% of people.
[01:38:26.208 --> 01:38:27.509]  How do we stop this?
[01:38:27.929 --> 01:38:35.055]  And again, in the phases, they shut the resources off, so then you become dependent on government, so it has you in its kill grid.
[01:38:35.095 --> 01:38:38.257]  The drugging, the cancer viruses, and the shots, the mercury.
[01:38:38.537 --> 01:38:39.878]  I mean, it's all happening.
[01:38:39.938 --> 01:38:40.719]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:38:40.999 --> 01:38:45.443]  Well, the food is poisoning us, the vaccines are poisoning us, on and on and on.
[01:38:45.723 --> 01:38:47.244]  Here's the thing to understand.
[01:38:47.264 --> 01:38:49.846]  Theoretically, there is a way to stop them.
[01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:52.408]  There really is a way to stop them, because
[01:38:53.195 --> 01:38:53.655]  I don't know.
[01:39:16.163 --> 01:39:19.544]  You know, what we all can't do is get in a bus and go to Washington today.
[01:39:19.564 --> 01:39:24.966]  You know, there are many ideas of what we can do that waste a huge amount of our time and effort that we don't have.
[01:39:25.046 --> 01:39:36.711]  But step number one that you can do, and it's one that will give you a lot of energy, if you sequence it right, is get as far away from them as you possibly can, or the people who implement their wishes in your hands.
[01:39:36.731 --> 01:39:39.372]  So, get out of the big cities, I say number one.
[01:39:39.992 --> 01:39:40.892]  Get to know your neighbors.
[01:39:40.932 --> 01:39:42.453]  Stop watching as much television.
[01:39:42.493 --> 01:39:43.073]  Get healthy.
[01:39:43.113 --> 01:39:43.973]  Purify your water.
[01:39:44.313 --> 01:39:46.834]  But more importantly, recognize them as the enemy.
[01:39:47.174 --> 01:39:49.074]  Don't just believe Catherine Austin Fitz.
[01:39:49.094 --> 01:39:50.394]  Don't just believe Alex Jones.
[01:39:50.695 --> 01:39:53.515]  Find out we're telling you the truth and this is life and death.
[01:39:53.815 --> 01:39:55.896]  And then the ball game isn't going to matter so much.
[01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:59.937]  And take all your energies and stop seeing Catherine Austin Fitz as your champion.
[01:40:00.477 --> 01:40:02.477]  Stop seeing Alex Jones as your champion.
[01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:05.038]  You know, she's not Joan of Arc and I'm not George Washington.
[01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:15.737]  You know, it's really funny, and when you withdraw, all your ideas are great, but what you want to get is financially not dependent on them as possible.
[01:40:16.317 --> 01:40:20.259]  So get as far away as you can from government money or money that they control.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:29.064]  One of the things that is just a profoundly important thing is everybody tomorrow in the country, Alex said, you know,
[01:40:29.695 --> 01:40:36.436]  Any bank that's trading derivatives or any of the big banks that got bailout money, I'm getting as far away from as I can.
[01:40:37.236 --> 01:40:47.600]  So, if you pulled your money out of the big banks and went to a well-managed local bank tomorrow, it would have a profound and traumatic impact.
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:51.362]  Now, you can say, well, all those banks channel money into Wall Street anyway.
[01:40:51.842 --> 01:40:58.784]  If I'm the Federal Reserve and I have to negotiate with 25,000 bank presidents as opposed to 10, it's a very different picture.
[01:40:58.864 --> 01:41:00.065]  It's a very different world.
[01:41:00.723 --> 01:41:01.023]  Okay?
[01:41:01.444 --> 01:41:20.520]  So anything you can do, it's real funny, I have a member of my network whose Jewish family was really hurt in the Holocaust, and he was asking me whether or not he should bank at a big bank, and I said, you know, you're basically asking me whether you should put your money with him or money management or not.
[01:41:21.266 --> 01:41:23.087]  Now, why are you asking me that question?
[01:41:23.147 --> 01:41:23.967]  Don't you know better?
[01:41:25.568 --> 01:41:26.529]  But that's what we're doing.
[01:41:26.569 --> 01:41:35.233]  We're financing... If you look at any activist group who's opposed to any of the things they say they... Let's say the guys are opposed to GMO.
[01:41:35.853 --> 01:41:41.837]  Well, if you look at where their money is, they're all financing the creation of GMOs and the building of that infrastructure.
[01:41:42.397 --> 01:41:43.437]  When you finance the U.S.
[01:41:43.477 --> 01:41:45.899]  government, you're financing genetically modified seed.
[01:41:46.639 --> 01:41:48.460]  You're financing the implementation of that.
[01:41:49.465 --> 01:41:55.608]  So part of it is, you know, withdraw as much as you can, your person, your family, how you spend your time.
[01:41:55.648 --> 01:41:56.989]  Don't be financially dependent.
[01:41:57.309 --> 01:42:00.530]  But stop financing the very things that are killing you and your family.
[01:42:02.471 --> 01:42:03.272]  Absolutely.
[01:42:03.972 --> 01:42:07.073]  Now, other solutions.
[01:42:08.614 --> 01:42:11.275]  I mean, I jumped in there when you said get as far away as you can from the money.
[01:42:11.315 --> 01:42:12.576]  Okay, here's the next solution.
[01:42:13.016 --> 01:42:17.298]  Who are you supporting for sheriff in this local election?
[01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:36.612]  Okay, if 3,100 counties, the sheriff, there's dual sovereignty under the Constitution, so your sheriff can literally tell the federal government to get off, you know, your county property and know they may not enforce something that is outside the 10th Amendment.
[01:42:37.426 --> 01:42:45.689]  Okay, so we're coming into election, the election cycle, and the election cycle is always a time, Alex, when you can be talking to your neighbors about all these issues.
[01:42:46.109 --> 01:42:55.013]  And let me tell you something, the fact that the bailouts and healthcare passed without having any kind of popular, sufficient popular support for a change of that,
[01:42:55.814 --> 01:42:56.915]  Extraordinary nature.
[01:42:56.935 --> 01:43:00.256]  It's got people worked up and they're ready to have a conversation.
[01:43:00.316 --> 01:43:05.738]  So, number one, you want to get into office the right kind of sheriff and you want your sheriff.
[01:43:06.259 --> 01:43:15.463]  Is your sheriff out there doing crime patrol or is your sheriff instead spending all of your tax money foreclosing on people on behalf of the big banks?
[01:43:15.963 --> 01:43:17.984]  And trying to squeeze people and raise revenue.
[01:43:18.004 --> 01:43:22.106]  We've always promoted patriot sheriffs, so we're on the same page on that front.
[01:43:22.146 --> 01:43:25.087]  The second thing is, in your state and local areas,
[01:43:25.686 --> 01:43:29.507]  You have candidates who are proposing 10th Amendment legislation.
[01:43:30.188 --> 01:43:32.948]  So, for example, Idaho passed the Health Freedom Act.
[01:43:33.509 --> 01:43:36.810]  We have lots of states trying to pass the Health Freedom Act.
[01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:42.852]  We have lots of states, you know, doing a variety of things on the 10th Amendment.
[01:43:42.872 --> 01:43:45.232]  There's a great 10th Amendment center online.
[01:43:45.733 --> 01:43:52.815]  So you want to find out where are the state and local representatives who are active on 10th Amendment and you want to get hooked up in supporting them.
[01:43:54.025 --> 01:43:54.385]  Okay.
[01:43:54.685 --> 01:43:56.827]  But the number one message here is get up.
[01:43:56.947 --> 01:43:59.228]  Don't just count on other people to do it.
[01:43:59.268 --> 01:44:00.809]  Now, I want to get into some other issues.
[01:44:00.829 --> 01:44:02.390]  I want to talk about some more solutions here.
[01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:04.831]  But I also want to talk about what their endgame is.
[01:44:05.771 --> 01:44:08.973]  Studying these larger... Okay, so can I mention one other thing?
[01:44:09.313 --> 01:44:09.694]  Go ahead.
[01:44:10.094 --> 01:44:11.675]  Stop giving them your data.
[01:44:13.727 --> 01:44:14.747]  There's Edwin Black.
[01:44:14.767 --> 01:44:16.168]  Have you ever had Edwin Black on?
[01:44:16.188 --> 01:44:16.248]  Yes.
[01:44:17.128 --> 01:44:21.889]  Edwin Black wrote the book about IBM building the database and computer systems for the Holocaust?
[01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.489]  Yes.
[01:44:22.789 --> 01:44:23.069]  Okay.
[01:44:23.469 --> 01:44:35.792]  Well, any kind of police state or any kind of slavery depends seriously on having the infrastructure you need, the database and computer infrastructure you need,
[01:44:36.311 --> 01:44:36.531]  I don't
[01:44:56.129 --> 01:44:56.930]  Thank you very much.
[01:45:09.257 --> 01:45:17.244]  Well, that's what this bill does.
[01:45:17.324 --> 01:45:19.405]  It says the IRS looks at the health care you're getting.
[01:45:19.425 --> 01:45:22.988]  You can take money out of your savings account, medical savings account.
[01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:29.553]  You were talking about how they're putting in new laws to track all your money or not let you get your money out of the country.
[01:45:29.814 --> 01:45:31.415]  The elites already pulled their money out.
[01:45:31.675 --> 01:45:35.178]  Now they want to make sure the middle class has to stay here and basically be sucked dry.
[01:45:35.677 --> 01:45:35.797]  Right.
[01:45:36.218 --> 01:45:40.222]  So what you want to do, the first thing you want to do is you want to get your data out of the system.
[01:45:40.362 --> 01:45:41.503]  Stop giving them data.
[01:45:41.523 --> 01:45:42.444]  Okay?
[01:45:42.784 --> 01:45:45.067]  And there are lots of different ways you can do that.
[01:45:45.547 --> 01:45:50.452]  And then the second thing you want to do is you want to get out of the money system as much as possible anyway.
[01:45:51.553 --> 01:45:56.919]  So anything you can do to protect, to not make yourself a target, you know, we can,
[01:45:58.587 --> 01:46:02.808]  Put our money in a stock, get a dividend, and then go buy water from the water company.
[01:46:03.228 --> 01:46:08.049]  But also, if we live in a rural area, we can just stop being in the middle, and we can go out and build a well.
[01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:12.329]  And then I don't need your stock, and I don't need your dividend, and I don't need your water bill.
[01:46:12.349 --> 01:46:15.870]  And that's why they're moving nationwide and worldwide to block people drilling their own wells.
[01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:17.010]  Well, that's why.
[01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:21.431]  If you can, you want to live in an area where you still have the power to do that.
[01:46:22.291 --> 01:46:26.312]  Okay, we're running out of time, and it's clear I've got to have you back up for a full hour just on solutions.
[01:46:27.659 --> 01:46:28.920]  Those are all great solutions.
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:31.062]  I, number one, say wake people up.
[01:46:31.122 --> 01:46:33.704]  They're ready to be woken up to the full horror.
[01:46:34.305 --> 01:46:47.054]  But looking at their program and being able to factor in all these different elements on a wide spectrum analysis, what do you see as their game plan in the next six months, to a year, to two years, out to five years?
[01:46:47.355 --> 01:46:50.617]  How do you see them unrolling this global financial takeover?
[01:46:50.637 --> 01:46:53.659]  And then we'll dovetail that with this war-making economy.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:56.081]  It isn't just launching wars overseas.
[01:46:56.481 --> 01:47:03.305]  Naked body scanners, surveillance, face scanners, CPS, DynCorp out grabbing more children for no reason.
[01:47:03.586 --> 01:47:07.908]  The Texas case where they're taking people's kids now if their parents say don't trust the government.
[01:47:08.148 --> 01:47:09.129]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[01:47:09.649 --> 01:47:09.789]  Right.
[01:47:09.869 --> 01:47:12.391]  No, it's well, it's been crazy for a long time.
[01:47:12.831 --> 01:47:15.473]  But it's going to become very crazy to most people.
[01:47:15.673 --> 01:47:23.958]  And I think what you need to do is first and foremost, you need to know that that if you are awake and out to protect yourself,
[01:47:24.676 --> 01:47:25.697]  They can't do this.
[01:47:25.857 --> 01:47:36.108]  And so the question is what... Step number one everybody has to do is turn off their TV and stop listening to their media and stay linked into media that's telling you the truth.
[01:47:36.128 --> 01:47:37.149]  That's step number one.
[01:47:37.529 --> 01:47:40.753]  Because the first way they control you, Alex, is with your mind.
[01:47:41.313 --> 01:47:43.415]  So the first step is get your mind clean.
[01:47:43.475 --> 01:47:44.777]  Don't let them control your mind.
[01:47:46.288 --> 01:47:56.078]  Well, I mean, how can a cop take a family's child and put on the CPS form they taught their children not to trust the government?
[01:47:56.098 --> 01:48:00.423]  I mean, that's right out of 1984, and these cops feel good while they're doing this.
[01:48:00.503 --> 01:48:02.065]  I mean, these are tyrants.
[01:48:02.085 --> 01:48:02.525]  You know why?
[01:48:02.545 --> 01:48:05.769]  Because I've seen this in my own situation when I was targeted.
[01:48:06.469 --> 01:48:10.891]  Every team, we had 18 audits and investigations at the Hamilton Securities Group.
[01:48:11.431 --> 01:48:17.654]  And when each one started, the people coming in to audit and investigate thought we were, you know, just bad, horrible people.
[01:48:18.214 --> 01:48:23.556]  And then we'd work with them, and before it was over, they'd be on our side again.
[01:48:23.856 --> 01:48:30.119]  But initially, they are taught to believe that you're bad people, and the problem is most people get defensive.
[01:48:30.965 --> 01:48:31.966]  And don't work through it.
[01:48:32.046 --> 01:48:37.769]  We were trained in spiritual warfare, so we saw it as our job to bring them across to the light, and usually did.
[01:48:38.509 --> 01:48:46.474]  And so, you know, they really don't know, and it's hard, Alex, for you to fathom that the system is that ugly or that evil.
[01:48:46.554 --> 01:48:49.976]  They really don't know, many of them.
[01:48:50.036 --> 01:48:51.157]  So we gotta turn them around.
[01:48:51.874 --> 01:49:08.339]  When you saw our article last Friday, cops and CPS seize child from parents for mistrusting government, I was aware of this, but you sent me a lot of stuff that I actually wasn't aware of, and we're going to be showing people some document cam shots right now, with DynCorp heavily involved
[01:49:09.359 --> 01:49:13.321]  Globally, it's been congressional hearings in white slavery, child kidnapping rings.
[01:49:13.661 --> 01:49:22.004]  They now have a new name, but CSC, DynCorp, and the economics... Well, they merged into CSC, and then they got spun off and went public, so they're back to their old name.
[01:49:23.072 --> 01:49:33.203]  Okay, so, but I mean, I have all the mainstream news articles, this is literally a legion of doom, and that's all part of their military operation, and grabbing kids is very lucrative.
[01:49:33.443 --> 01:49:39.310]  Well, the scariest story in the world, and one that's hard for most people to get into, is the role of pedophilia.
[01:49:39.930 --> 01:49:44.115]  And pedophilia is a very old story, Alex, it's been used for years.
[01:49:44.881 --> 01:49:50.662]  You know, as both a personnel benefit, if you will, and a form of entrapment.
[01:49:51.183 --> 01:49:58.364]  Once you get a file, you know, once you get dirty pictures of somebody engaged in pedophilia, a politician or business leader, you own them for life.
[01:49:58.404 --> 01:50:02.825]  It's one of the most economic ways to control their... I hate to say it, but that's the reality.
[01:50:02.845 --> 01:50:11.047]  If you look at the history of narcotics trafficking and mortgage fraud in this country, it's intimately linked with pedophilia and sex slavery.
[01:50:11.207 --> 01:50:13.088]  You know, I just hate to say it, but that's the way it is.
[01:50:13.835 --> 01:50:21.103]  And I got onto DynCorp in the 90s because you had a couple of whistleblowers when DynCorp was a government contract.
[01:50:21.903 --> 01:50:27.970]  You had their project managers literally engaged in owning, you know, buying and owning children and using them for sex.
[01:50:29.297 --> 01:50:36.980]  And working with the local mafias who were tracking it, and yet the State Department, where DynCorp is the biggest contract, was forgiving all of this.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:38.760]  Anyway, this is all on the public record.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:43.742]  And then DynCorp started to pop up in child protective services contracts around the country.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.102]  And we were in a tough... Stay there!
[01:50:46.223 --> 01:50:46.864]  Stay there, Catherine.
[01:50:46.924 --> 01:50:55.676]  I'm going to have to have you back for a full hour soon on this subject because I actually got death threats when I first started covering this about eight years ago when we learned about 9 Corp.
[01:50:56.577 --> 01:50:58.560]  Just modern slave traffickers.
[01:50:59.454 --> 01:51:02.635]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:51:02.995 --> 01:51:04.835]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:51:05.275 --> 01:51:05.715]  Don't!
[01:51:06.155 --> 01:51:09.176]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:18.358]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[01:51:18.678 --> 01:51:22.339]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:51:22.739 --> 01:51:25.462]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:51:25.482 --> 01:51:32.931]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:51:33.272 --> 01:51:34.273]  Herb K was right.
[01:51:34.453 --> 01:51:37.497]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:51:37.657 --> 01:51:38.678]  What have you got to lose?
[01:51:39.078 --> 01:51:40.060]  Stop the calls now!
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.042]  Get out of debt and have more money!
[01:51:42.382 --> 01:51:43.143]  Get Herb K.'

[01:52:00.097 --> 01:52:03.380]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:52:16.611 --> 01:52:22.893]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:52:23.293 --> 01:52:28.855]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:33.056]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:52:33.437 --> 01:52:37.478]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:52:37.738 --> 01:52:40.519]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[01:52:40.959 --> 01:52:43.340]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:46.761]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:52:47.221 --> 01:52:48.642]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:52:49.202 --> 01:52:49.702]  It's here.

[01:53:18.931 --> 01:53:19.812]  Now something fun.
[01:53:20.052 --> 01:53:20.813]  It's springtime.
[01:53:20.993 --> 01:53:28.697]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.

[01:54:07.819 --> 01:54:13.582]  On the 21st of April, later this month, Katherine Austen-Fitz will spend at least an hour with us.
[01:54:13.622 --> 01:54:15.923]  She's very, very gracious.
[01:54:15.963 --> 01:54:17.965]  We'll give you her website before she leaves us.
[01:54:18.365 --> 01:54:20.206]  But for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers,
[01:54:22.361 --> 01:54:24.864]  I was just showing mainstream news articles.
[01:54:24.924 --> 01:54:30.011]  I have congressional hearings where DynCorp, they say, well, you kidnapped tens of thousands of children for sex slaves.
[01:54:30.432 --> 01:54:33.075]  And then they asked Rumsfeld, why are they allowed to do this?
[01:54:33.115 --> 01:54:34.297]  And he just said, they just are.
[01:54:34.317 --> 01:54:39.183]  And again, the magnitude of the evil at DynCorp.
[01:54:39.884 --> 01:54:48.448]  I'd known some of this, but she sent me a link to news articles and government purchase orders where they're involved all over warehousing the kids once they're taken.
[01:54:48.508 --> 01:54:52.511]  So now, it's not enough to grab Iraqi kids or Serb kids, now they're grabbing our kids.
[01:54:52.531 --> 01:54:53.511]  Catherine, finish your story.
[01:54:54.412 --> 01:55:04.977]  Okay, so the way I got onto this was I was in Washington and I had come on to DynCorp because of their role in the war on drugs.
[01:55:05.874 --> 01:55:08.477]  And I'll tell you two stories.
[01:55:08.557 --> 01:55:21.990]  The first was a group of peasant women from South America came up to give a presentation to congressmen, and they gave a presentation in Washington on how they were being moved off their land.
[01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:26.774]  Private people were picking up their land for cheap, and then the government was building housing.
[01:55:27.645 --> 01:55:37.031]  You know, this whole war on drugs game, and so I kept asking them questions, and finally they got very suspicious and said, how come you know so much about how the money works in our country?
[01:55:37.051 --> 01:55:44.056]  And I said, well, I was the Assistant Secretary of Housing, and apparently it works the same way in your country as it works in ours.
[01:55:44.717 --> 01:55:56.164]  So afterwards, I did a little research and discovered the same contractor in enforcement at HUD in this country was the lead contractor in Latin America in the war on drugs.
[01:55:56.224 --> 01:55:56.945]  It was DynCorp.
[01:55:57.648 --> 01:56:14.915]  So I started to get in and look at DynCorp and on and on and on and that's when the story of the sex slave trafficking came out and it was unbelievable because Insight Magazine, Alex, wrote a great story about sex slave trafficking, the allegations in connection with the DynCorp litigation.
[01:56:15.416 --> 01:56:23.119]  Those magazines' cover story were dropped on every senator and every congressman's desk
[01:56:23.797 --> 01:56:28.484]  And the next week, both the Navy and the State Department gave huge new contracts to DynCorp.
[01:56:29.044 --> 01:56:30.607]  It didn't seem to matter.
[01:56:31.047 --> 01:56:32.008]  It was quite amazing.
[01:56:32.489 --> 01:56:40.941]  Anyway, so fast forward, I ended up writing a series of stories about DynCorp and illuminating what was going on because in fact,
[01:56:41.539 --> 01:56:50.524]  The chairman of the Finance Committee at Enron was a private investor who was the chairman and lead investor for many years in DynCorp.
[01:56:51.065 --> 01:56:56.048]  And the linkages between DynCorp and some of what was going on with the funny money was pretty scary.
[01:56:56.848 --> 01:57:01.151]  So, when our litigation was very hot and heavy,
[01:57:02.191 --> 01:57:10.756]  I and, of course, Dinecore is a big contractor at the Department of Justice and was said by the Inflog people to be one of the managers of the Promise software.
[01:57:10.856 --> 01:57:27.545]  Anyway, so we're in the middle of a litigation and I have a person, one of the people working for me, helping me do the litigation support work, which was very time-consuming, came to me and said, you know, somebody from Child Protective Services showed up at my house.
[01:57:28.747 --> 01:57:30.908]  And this is a child molestation army.
[01:57:52.312 --> 01:58:08.485]  Well, but what you need to, so last week when I saw what was going on in Texas, I said, you want to check and see whether DynCorp is behind, you know, is in the mix, because the idea of going after people's children just because they disagree with government policy, this is a real risk.
[01:58:10.006 --> 01:58:10.707]  This is Pierre Abel.
[01:58:10.747 --> 01:58:12.088]  Do you have one more point you wanted to make?
[01:58:12.628 --> 01:58:12.868]  Yes.
[01:58:13.148 --> 01:58:14.690]  I just wanted to thank you, Alex.
[01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:18.713]  You sent two of your incredible producers down to my house.
[01:58:19.638 --> 01:58:22.941]  During a snowstorm, they came all the way out from Memphis in a snowstorm.
[01:58:22.961 --> 01:58:23.941]  I never thought they'd make it.
[01:58:24.442 --> 01:58:25.663]  We spent a day filming.
[01:58:25.703 --> 01:58:27.004]  They were so intelligent.
[01:58:27.024 --> 01:58:28.144]  They were so professional.
[01:58:28.164 --> 01:58:29.165]  They were so capable.
[01:58:29.766 --> 01:58:33.669]  I said, wow, you know, Alex Jones is going to a whole new level.
[01:58:34.209 --> 01:58:34.889]  What a team.
[01:58:34.909 --> 01:58:35.750]  I was very impressed.
[01:58:35.770 --> 01:58:36.691]  You're a sweetheart.
[01:58:36.731 --> 01:58:37.812]  Kathryn Austin Fitz.
[01:58:37.892 --> 01:58:38.532]  God bless you.

[01:58:49.844 --> 01:58:52.446]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:52.846 --> 01:58:57.809]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:58.169 --> 01:58:59.910]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:00.230 --> 01:59:05.033]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:05.214 --> 01:59:06.194]  How much do you want?
[01:59:06.414 --> 01:59:07.155]  When do you want it?
[01:59:07.535 --> 01:59:09.136]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:09.416 --> 01:59:10.237]  When will you need it?
[01:59:10.497 --> 01:59:12.558]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:12.698 --> 01:59:13.679]  Will there be any food?
