[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.191]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:02.732 --> 00:00:05.534]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.796]  We're good to go.
[00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:19.802]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:21.363]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:23.465]  James Dillingpole is with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:26.448]  He's an English journalist and novelist.
[00:02:27.128 --> 00:02:37.137]  He has published several books that are bestsellers, and he also writes for the Daily Telegraph, the American Spectator, the Libertarian Conservative.
[00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:39.319]  His website is jamesdillingpole.com.
[00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.902]  And I wanted to get him on with his take on the oil spill.
[00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:50.229]  And he's had headlines about how these organizations out there that want to take control of society through government love a good oil spill.
[00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:59.538]  My issue is, is that it's government that has blocked these states
[00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:27.187]  In Louisiana, in Mississippi, in Florida, from blocking their estuaries, from putting up their sand berms, it's a government that's allowed BP to say no to the Dutch government with its skimmers that are experts in this and had ships in the area, no to other oil companies that wanted to help, the military hasn't been sent in, and we're now forty-something days into this, and it's one of the biggest oil spills in history, and it's in threatening the entire
[00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:46.648]  Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and the government response in many areas where the fishing hasn't been damaged, the total ban on fishing is accentuating the crisis and many analysts are saying Obama wants to let this crisis get worse so he can nationalize the oil.
[00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.730]  And so this is the type of system we're dealing with and facing.
[00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:56.172]  And going to James Dillingpole, we'll get his breakdown.
[00:03:56.212 --> 00:03:57.333]  James, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:03:57.353 --> 00:03:59.434]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:10.079]  Yeah, no, I do agree with much of your analysis that I think President Obama very much sees this crisis as a Rahm Emanuel-style opportunity.
[00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.520]  You know, it's almost a dream come true for him.
[00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:17.283]  Because, you know, he's got disastrous approval ratings.
[00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.504]  You know, his presidency is going down the pan.
[00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:30.628]  What better than a tremendous crisis which takes people's eye off the ball and enables him to do what despots do around the world, which is blame the filthy foreigners.
[00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:33.769]  In this case, the filthy foreigners are, of course, us Brits.
[00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:44.072]  He's been indulging in this massive amount of Brit-bashing, you know, really exaggerating how much this is a British affair, which, you know, BP is a multinational.
[00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:57.197]  And the second thing I think which is disgraceful about his behaviour in this very shoddy affair, is that he is quite clearly using this as an excuse to hammer the fossil fuel industry.
[00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:00.698]  To advance his green agenda.
[00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:14.702]  And, you know, to give the eco-freaks just the excuse they need to say, look, this is what happens when you use fossil fuels, pelicans die, manatees probably get covered in oil too, you know.
[00:05:14.722 --> 00:05:17.263]  You know, I feel sorry for the people of Louisiana.
[00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:18.884]  I feel sorry for the shrimp fishermen.
[00:05:18.924 --> 00:05:22.625]  I feel sorry for the people who run tourist cafes on beaches.
[00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:25.506]  All these people, it's horrible that they're suffering.
[00:05:25.606 --> 00:05:32.431]  But it is a political diversion, and I'll bash corruption in England, the socialist government, the police state all day.
[00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:35.193]  That's not the British people, that's not the people of the UK.
[00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:42.018]  But just like Barack Obama is the people of America, though he did bamboozle the 35% or so that voted for him in the country.
[00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:44.940]  But expanding on that, it is a distraction.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.786]  To sit there and to be scapegoating England when BP is Dutch, British and American.
[00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:58.389]  Goldman Sachs International was the chairman of BP.
[00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:02.431]  I mean, that's like saying that Goldman Sachs is American.
[00:06:02.671 --> 00:06:15.380]  If Goldman Sachs is out robbing the people of Greece, that has nothing to do with the United States, that this parasitic international globalist organization happens to nest in London, New York and Brussels.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.601]  I know.
[00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:19.422]  It's funny you should mention Goldman Sachs, Alex.
[00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:24.625]  Are you familiar with the story about them dumping their BP shares?
[00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:24.625]  44%!
[00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:27.066]  And they weren't dumping other oil companies.
[00:06:27.106 --> 00:06:32.710]  They dumped BP in the two days before, and it turns out the BP head dumped a bunch of his.
[00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:34.787]  Now, what's your take on that?
[00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:38.590]  I mean, it sounds pretty weird coincidence, would you say?
[00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.894]  And it turns out they had some weird part that no one will say who put it in.
[00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:44.375]  No one understands it.
[00:06:44.555 --> 00:06:47.818]  You had Obama giving this very oil rig the special award.
[00:06:48.078 --> 00:06:54.583]  You have BP being this top New World Order group pushing global carbon taxes and kind of bullying the other oil companies into it.
[00:06:54.783 --> 00:06:56.845]  Their whole global carbon tax is falling apart.
[00:06:57.185 --> 00:07:07.534]  Now there's a well they can't fix, and Obama was in the Washington Post with a headline that he's going to use this to bring in a new tax in the name of cleaning it up on gasoline.
[00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:08.935]  Yeah, you know what, James?
[00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.196]  I think they staged it.
[00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:11.317]  I think they blew it.
[00:07:11.577 --> 00:07:12.758]  I think this is a black op.
[00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:17.462]  At the end of the day, I think it's a false flag, because key bono, who benefits?
[00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:26.585]  Regardless, they're letting the crisis continue, and I want to say, why are the state governments saying the feds told us we can't protect our beaches?
[00:07:26.785 --> 00:07:30.966]  Since when does the federal government tell the states what they can and can't do?
[00:07:31.286 --> 00:07:39.188]  All these people need to quit complaining and say, oh, we're sick of the feds telling us we can't fix this, and they need to go down there and get to work!
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.401]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:52.968]  Well, am I right in thinking that it was Obama who authorised the continued use of that film, that ongoing movie, showing the oil being pumped out, you know, of the sea bottom?
[00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:55.890]  I mean, that's inflammatory stuff in itself.
[00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.833]  You know, he's clearly milking this crisis and trying to take advantage of it.
[00:08:00.273 --> 00:08:06.577]  And this is not the kind of behaviour I would expect of the leader of the free world.
[00:08:06.997 --> 00:08:23.142]  You know, what he should have done, what he should be doing is making a case, saying, look, you know, I know oil is messy, evil stuff, you know, when it leaks out, but face it, we live in a world which depends on fuel, on oil, and will do for a considerable time into the future.
[00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:26.844]  So we have to be phlegmatic about this and accept that accidents will happen.
[00:08:26.864 --> 00:08:34.106]  You know, they can't use it as a way of hammering the industry, which powers our economies.
[00:08:37.932 --> 00:08:44.905]  Well, James, I mean, I couldn't say it any better than you elaborate on that.
[00:08:47.233 --> 00:08:50.976]  I mean, we are... I'm funny enough, I'm writing a book about this subject at the moment.
[00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:56.139]  We are effectively fighting a massive ideological war.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:12.491]  And it is between those of us who believe in freedom, in liberty, in government staying out of our lives, and those who believe that the world is doomed unless we can impose some kind of new world order
[00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:20.019]  And at the moment, the Green Movement is being used to give fuel, so to speak, to that particular argument.
[00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:28.748]  You know, the idea that the environment is going to hell in a handcart, and that therefore, organizations like the United Nations need to step in.
[00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:29.789]  Well, James...
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.281]  I mean, looking into your crystal ball, where do you see this ending?
[00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:56.822]  I mean, where is all this leading?
[00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:59.843]  Is it just going to be an endless hundred-year oil leak?
[00:09:59.863 --> 00:10:03.345]  They're now saying it may last another year, and that no one's allowed to touch it.
[00:10:03.385 --> 00:10:06.726]  BP is God, and no one takes responsibility.
[00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:10.568]  And, of course, BP is one of his biggest contributors.
[00:10:10.928 --> 00:10:12.949]  They're a darling of the Obamanoids.
[00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:19.752]  I mean, every time I'm in an airport or open a magazine, it's BP, global governance, global carbon tax ads.
[00:10:19.772 --> 00:10:20.993]  You've got Queen Beatrix.
[00:10:21.753 --> 00:10:25.276]  Who owns part of it, prancing around, who's part of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:10:25.616 --> 00:10:27.137]  I mean, this is incredible!
[00:10:28.498 --> 00:10:38.485]  Yeah, certainly, despite being British, I have no sympathy whatsoever with BP for precisely that reason you give.
[00:10:39.626 --> 00:10:45.891]  Nobody has been more assiduous in advancing the anthropogenic global warming agenda
[00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:47.092]  Then BP!
[00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:53.077]  You know, the Greenies are always talking about how Big Oil is financing people like you and me.
[00:10:53.338 --> 00:10:56.240]  Well, I wish, Alex, I wish I was financed by Big Oil.
[00:10:56.561 --> 00:11:06.710]  The fact is that long ago, Big Oil started moving into funding the climate hysterics, you know, people who believe in man-made global warming.
[00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.953]  I have never received one cent from Big Oil.
[00:11:11.053 --> 00:11:12.034]  I own no stock.
[00:11:12.054 --> 00:11:21.940]  I guess I do have some cousins that have these little, you know, Texas wells where you get about a thousand bucks a month if you're lucky, but that's about as big a connection as I have to Big Oil.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.801]  You know, I mean, this is insane.
[00:11:25.202 --> 00:11:27.223]  And then meanwhile, Big Oil's always pushing it.
[00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:36.319]  It's a source of great sadness to me, Alex, as no doubt it is to you, that Big Oil refuses to fund my lifestyle, despite the fact that I love oil.
[00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:39.380]  You know, I'm constantly writing about how oil is great.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.721]  You know, we need gas for our cars.
[00:11:41.741 --> 00:11:42.521]  We need gas.
[00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:43.861]  We need cheap gas.
[00:11:44.081 --> 00:11:44.582]  Exactly.
[00:11:44.622 --> 00:11:45.742]  In fact, I want to say this.
[00:11:45.842 --> 00:11:50.764]  If Big Oil wants to sponsor me, because, I mean, I take sponsorship if I believe in it.
[00:11:51.184 --> 00:11:52.964]  I'm ready for Big Oil sponsorship.
[00:11:53.425 --> 00:11:57.206]  We'll have ads publicly on the air and admit we're financed by Big Oil.
[00:11:57.526 --> 00:11:59.128]  Give us the money, James.
[00:11:59.168 --> 00:11:59.728]  Give it to him, too.
[00:11:59.768 --> 00:12:02.651]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.

[00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:10.998]  I listen to talk radio, I watch the news.
[00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:13.400]  All they talk about is the oil spill.
[00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:21.486]  And a lot of times, if it's Anna Nicole Smith or OJ Simpson or Michael Jackson, it's artificial media hype.
[00:16:21.807 --> 00:16:24.048]  Because my callers to my show
[00:16:25.197 --> 00:16:25.357]  Are you
[00:16:48.626 --> 00:16:58.930]  They're getting more and more angry, but what I'm getting angry at is hearing Jindal and others keep whining and saying the Feds won't let us do this.
[00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.471]  It's called the Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment.
[00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:03.932]  It's time for them to push the Feds aside.
[00:17:03.972 --> 00:17:13.195]  And if some BP employees pull up and say, we've got federal authority, and they start trying to push people around, I mean, you know, it needs to stop.
[00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:14.248]  Yeah.
[00:17:15.088 --> 00:17:24.490]  The thing is, Alex, you have to look at the history of the Green Movement to understand that there is nothing that Green is like better than a nice, juicy oil spill.
[00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:34.132]  And the reason they like a nice, juicy oil spill is because it presents them with ready-made images of seagulls, you know, seabirds covered in black.
[00:17:35.072 --> 00:17:43.374]  It gives them a sort of excuse for audiences to circumvent thought and really feel about how awful, how bad oil is.
[00:17:44.154 --> 00:17:45.756]  And I'll give you an example of this.
[00:17:45.776 --> 00:17:54.305]  You know Earth Day, that event that was founded in 1970 by a US sort of eco-tard senator called, I think, Gaylord Nelson was it?
[00:17:55.367 --> 00:18:03.856]  That was Earth Day, which was the birth of the modern environmental movement, was inspired by the Santa Barbara
[00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:05.517]  Well, let me ask you that then.
[00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:08.618]  I mean, I'm saying all the evidence points towards false flag.
[00:18:08.658 --> 00:18:10.579]  I'm not sure that's the case, but more and more
[00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:30.654]  It appears that there's some hanky-panky going on.
[00:18:30.934 --> 00:18:34.180]  Bare minimum, they're doing everything they can to let it continue to pour.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.949]  I mean, at your gut level, James, are you starting to think something's rotten in the state of the Gulf?
[00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:47.542]  Look, my immediate reaction when I read a bit about it was, yeah, that there was some kind of sabotage involved.
[00:18:47.582 --> 00:18:48.883]  But I've got no proof of that.
[00:18:49.203 --> 00:18:51.844]  It could just be, you know, cock-up rather than conspiracy.
[00:18:52.104 --> 00:18:54.025]  I mean, of course they've got the motive to do this.
[00:18:54.065 --> 00:18:57.406]  Well, why did Obama say, we're going to send SWAT teams at first?
[00:18:57.446 --> 00:19:00.308]  Maybe it was some Green Movement organization.
[00:19:00.768 --> 00:19:03.429]  Why did this happen a month after he approved of drilling?
[00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:05.361]  Yeah.
[00:19:05.421 --> 00:19:10.383]  As I said, there are lots of people out there who would have cause to do this kind of thing.
[00:19:10.704 --> 00:19:18.947]  I still believe, having talked to people who work in the oil industry, that it would be quite hard to sabotage a thing like this.
[00:19:19.267 --> 00:19:21.768]  I think it's still more likely to be an accident.
[00:19:21.908 --> 00:19:23.308]  Either way, it doesn't really matter.
[00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:24.709]  What matters is the way it's being
[00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:25.810]  I don't
[00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:51.834]  Five million tons, five million tons of petroleum were spilled in the Atlantic by tankers sunk by Nazi submarines between 1942 and 1945.
[00:19:52.254 --> 00:20:01.601]  So, averaged over 1,000 days, the loss is equivalent to two to five times the oil now spilled in the Gulf of Mexico every day for the duration of the war.
[00:20:02.021 --> 00:20:05.423]  So, you know... Yeah, those wolf packs were sinking sometimes 20 ships in one day.
[00:20:08.069 --> 00:20:15.199]  Yeah, and unfortunately there were no green eco-convoys to be torpedoed at the same time, because that would have done us all an enormous favour.
[00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:17.001]  But they weren't around in those days.
[00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:19.325]  People had bigger issues to worry about.
[00:20:22.358 --> 00:20:24.780]  I tell you, where do you see this going?
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:30.723]  I mean, Obama has said he wants a new tax to pay for the Gulf, but it's going to be a new carbon tax on everybody's gasoline.
[00:20:30.983 --> 00:20:32.604]  Yes, yes.
[00:20:32.644 --> 00:20:42.250]  Well, I mean, this is the real tragedy about this tragedy, which is that up until this point, Obama's cap and trade was dead in the water.
[00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:50.916]  Nobody in the Senate was going to vote for this nonsense because they saw how unpopular healthcare, Obamacare was, and they weren't going to take it.
[00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:51.836]  Yes.
[00:21:22.556 --> 00:21:24.237]  Yeah, well, crisis opportunity.
[00:21:24.257 --> 00:21:25.177]  I mean, go figure.
[00:21:25.457 --> 00:21:26.137]  James, stay there.
[00:21:26.197 --> 00:21:37.740]  I want to continue to flesh this out with you and take calls from listeners specifically on the oil spill, on the carbon tax and gas tax legislation, and what the public out there thinks is behind this.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.441]  And your questions for James Dillingpole, jamesdillingpole.com, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:52.399]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.342 --> 00:21:56.030]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:58.612 --> 00:22:02.855]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:03.175 --> 00:22:03.795]  Number one.
[00:22:04.075 --> 00:22:07.237]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:07.498 --> 00:22:08.078]  Number two.
[00:22:08.358 --> 00:22:12.921]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:13.261 --> 00:22:13.702]  It's true.
[00:22:14.002 --> 00:22:18.565]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:18.865 --> 00:22:19.425]  Number three.
[00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:22.987]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:23.288 --> 00:22:26.990]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.750]  Number four.
[00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.351]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:34.132]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:34.412 --> 00:22:34.973]  Number five.
[00:22:35.213 --> 00:22:39.134]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:39.354 --> 00:22:44.115]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:22:44.416 --> 00:22:48.437]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:48.577 --> 00:22:50.137]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:50.357 --> 00:22:54.979]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:22:55.299 --> 00:22:55.519]  877-327-0365.
[00:22:55.559 --> 00:23:01.804]  You may be arrested, and you're subject to other police action.
[00:23:02.584 --> 00:23:03.525]  Tyranny is here.
[00:23:03.845 --> 00:23:07.568]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:23:07.588 --> 00:23:09.990]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:15.194]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:23:15.874 --> 00:23:22.139]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:28.083]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:23:28.503 --> 00:23:32.206]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:23:32.686 --> 00:23:36.667]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:23:36.967 --> 00:23:42.448]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:23:42.928 --> 00:23:45.849]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:23:46.469 --> 00:23:47.849]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:23:48.449 --> 00:23:48.949]  It's here.

[00:23:58.868 --> 00:24:01.469]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:24:01.869 --> 00:24:06.831]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:08.931]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:24:09.252 --> 00:24:14.073]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:24:14.253 --> 00:24:15.214]  How much do you want?
[00:24:15.434 --> 00:24:16.174]  When do you want it?
[00:24:16.554 --> 00:24:18.155]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:19.255]  When will you need it?
[00:24:19.515 --> 00:24:21.576]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:24:21.717 --> 00:24:22.817]  Will there be any food?
[00:24:23.057 --> 00:24:24.378]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:24:24.578 --> 00:24:29.640]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.982]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:24:33.422 --> 00:24:36.925]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:24:37.245 --> 00:24:38.226]  How much will you need?
[00:24:38.466 --> 00:24:39.107]  We don't know.
[00:24:39.387 --> 00:24:40.288]  How much do you want?
[00:24:40.488 --> 00:24:41.209]  All you can get.
[00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:42.250]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.272]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:24:45.552 --> 00:24:48.675]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:49.195]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:09.883]  Don't forget ladies and gentlemen, we have an online video slash t-shirt ball cap online store.
[00:25:21.371 --> 00:25:32.754]  at InfoWars.com and everything in the store is about getting the word out whether it's an InfoWars.com t-shirt or a Don't Tread on Me ball cap or InfoWars.com bumper sticker.
[00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:37.236]  All the orders get free citizen rule books in them.
[00:25:38.345 --> 00:25:43.572]  Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, famous quotes by founding fathers.
[00:25:44.232 --> 00:25:51.601]  Basically, this is like garlic and crosses and sunlight to these people running our government.
[00:25:52.486 --> 00:26:00.891]  And we've got all the 20-plus films I've produced and more than a hundred books and videos that I have read or watched and that I think are informative.
[00:26:01.452 --> 00:26:06.155]  That's what's in the store, stuff that I'm into, stuff that I think's, you know, the best research out there.
[00:26:07.736 --> 00:26:09.057]  So please peruse it.
[00:26:09.137 --> 00:26:13.780]  Everything there I certify as being information that I think is valuable.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:20.626]  For what that's worth, but only the best of the best, in my perspective, at InfoWars.com.
[00:26:21.106 --> 00:26:25.671]  And secondarily, your purchase of the books, the videos, the t-shirts, also funds this operation.
[00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:33.358]  I'm not funded by the oil companies, I'm not funded by the Ford Foundation, like all the big leftist publications that lie about me every day.
[00:26:33.979 --> 00:26:43.662]  I'm not funded by General Electric and the bomb makers like Chris Matthews with his big hit piece about me and Rand Paul that we have the script of now that's worse than I thought coming out next Wednesday.
[00:26:44.363 --> 00:26:46.043]  We're funded by you, the listeners.
[00:26:46.663 --> 00:26:48.344]  I am funded by you.
[00:26:48.844 --> 00:26:50.284]  You decide if we grow.
[00:26:50.565 --> 00:26:51.985]  You decide if we survive.
[00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:54.726]  You decide the future of this operation.
[00:26:55.966 --> 00:27:03.189]  So again, InfoWars.com to order Don't Tread on Me, LeBarry Sotaro, Barack Obama.
[00:27:04.517 --> 00:27:18.862]  T-shirts, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, The Obama Deception, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, The Secret Team by Fletcher Prouty, now republished for the first time in decades, Jesse Ventura's new book, American Conspiracy, massively discounted.
[00:27:18.882 --> 00:27:23.464]  You can get a free film of your choice when you order the book for a limited time, because I've almost sold out.
[00:27:23.484 --> 00:27:28.206]  And then once they sell out, I'm going to buy a few more and keep it in the shopping cart, but stop that discount.
[00:27:28.786 --> 00:27:33.431]  All available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:42.520]  We're going to go to John, Jack, TruthPatriot, Denny, Ron, and others here in a moment for James Dillingpole.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.123]  But James, about a year before Obama got in office,
[00:27:46.959 --> 00:27:54.703]  Uh, you know, you were already speaking out against him, and you could see that he was the heir apparent, and then, uh, right after he got elected, you had your book out about Obamaland.
[00:27:54.723 --> 00:28:06.788]  Uh, I mean, he really is scary, because this isn't just some corrupt Richard Nixon doing bad things, and it's not some George Herbert Walker Bush, you know, launching, uh, you know, wars, which is bad enough.
[00:28:07.248 --> 00:28:12.770]  I mean, this guy is really trying to overthrow the government, trying to overthrow our system.
[00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.811]  I mean, Elena Kagan...
[00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:25.057]  They're blocking most of her papers, but the papers we've gotten from just a few years ago say, ban the Second Amendment, ban private property, ban free speech.
[00:28:25.438 --> 00:28:28.920]  You've got all these White House czars saying, ban free speech.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.082]  You've got the FTC saying, ban free speech whenever we want.
[00:28:33.402 --> 00:28:38.946]  I mean, we are literally becoming the Soviet Union here, and I guess so is England to a great respect.
[00:28:40.267 --> 00:28:42.268]  I mean, what is it like to actually watch this happening?
[00:28:43.146 --> 00:29:03.655]  I say to you, welcome to the suck, because, you know, we have been experiencing this problem for, well, I mean, we've just lived under 13 years of socialism under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, we belong to the EU SSR, you know, I mean, the European Union is effectively a milder version of the old Soviet Union, you know, it's all about
[00:29:04.535 --> 00:29:07.918]  Regulation by unelected bureaucrats.
[00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:13.944]  The reason I wrote that book, Welcome to Obama Land, is I knew your future.
[00:29:13.984 --> 00:29:16.226]  I could see it coming because I'd already experienced it.
[00:29:16.906 --> 00:29:18.448]  I know how socialists work.
[00:29:18.968 --> 00:29:26.355]  I know that President Obama is a socialist and he's got an administration stuffed with people even worse than socialists.
[00:29:26.715 --> 00:29:30.479]  Particularly people like John Holdren, Carol Browner,
[00:29:31.319 --> 00:29:36.243]  You know, half of you are Van Jones, for example.
[00:29:36.503 --> 00:29:41.926]  These are the kind of people who do not like concepts like liberty.
[00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:43.947]  They do not like the American way.
[00:29:44.288 --> 00:29:47.570]  Because the American way is about self-determination.
[00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.132]  It is about, you know, personal responsibility.
[00:29:51.512 --> 00:29:54.034]  And these people do not believe in that kind of stuff.
[00:29:54.354 --> 00:29:56.235]  They believe in big government.
[00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:57.856]  They believe in control.
[00:29:57.916 --> 00:29:59.377]  The more control, the better.
[00:29:59.758 --> 00:30:00.118]  And you know,
[00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:06.140]  Until you get rid of Obama, and pray God that you do, you are going to see more and more of this stuff happening.
[00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:11.082]  Well, we now have set up debtor prisons again in the US.
[00:30:11.102 --> 00:30:17.585]  The Star Tribune reports a woman arrested for a non-crime, for an unpaid $250 debt.
[00:30:20.624 --> 00:30:24.126]  Here's another one at the Maine Veterans Cemetery in Virginia.
[00:30:24.606 --> 00:30:27.768]  They've put up a huge plaque of Joseph Stalin.
[00:30:27.788 --> 00:30:32.470]  In fact, I'll give PrisonPlanet.tv viewers a document cam shot of this while James is talking about it.
[00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:34.992]  There's a Wall Street Journal article today.
[00:30:36.272 --> 00:30:44.295]  Saying that Americans who don't want to be strip-searched on top of the naked body scanners in front of people are vain.
[00:30:44.895 --> 00:30:52.957]  And so the control freaks, call them socialist, fascist, you know, big government people, they always love to push the limit.
[00:30:53.338 --> 00:30:57.379]  I mean, they're really trying to break our will and make us submit to anything.
[00:31:00.712 --> 00:31:01.813]  Certainly are, yeah.
[00:31:02.614 --> 00:31:11.222]  No, I agree entirely with your analysis about, you know, socialists, communists, fascists, they are all part of the same instinct.
[00:31:11.643 --> 00:31:20.631]  This is ultimately the battle we're fighting between libertarians like you and me, and I should think your listeners, and people who want to control stuff.
[00:31:21.572 --> 00:31:26.315]  Uh, and, uh, you know, they're gonna increasingly try and shut us down.
[00:31:26.395 --> 00:31:33.478]  They're gonna find ways of controlling the internet, they're gonna find ways of controlling talk radio, and, uh, we're gonna have to fight for this stuff.
[00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:36.380]  And by the way, they're now proposing this.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.882]  This isn't just a few academics a decade ago talking about it.
[00:31:40.222 --> 00:31:43.664]  This is all over the news, and they're calmly putting it forward
[00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:53.664]  Saying, oh yeah, by the way, we're going to start taxing alternative news sites and giving it to the old line newspapers.
[00:31:54.024 --> 00:31:58.625]  I mean, that was actually proposed last week by the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:31:58.965 --> 00:32:00.886]  That is absolute robbery.
[00:32:01.738 --> 00:32:02.398]  Yeah, well, of course.
[00:32:02.418 --> 00:32:04.058]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:32:04.098 --> 00:32:07.799]  They're going to use money and power to try and destroy us.
[00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:12.040]  You know, we are the X-Wing fighter pilots fighting against the Death Star.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.820]  And the Death Star is very big.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.100]  And Darth Vader is in charge, you know.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.901]  This is a tough battle we've got to fight.
[00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:30.103]  Well, I guess that's like the BBC, where they don't fund James Dillingpole to write for a private newspaper, but they tax everyone to pay for BBC brainwashing.
[00:32:30.803 --> 00:32:32.344]  Yeah, I'm glad you made that point.
[00:32:32.404 --> 00:32:47.692]  We have to pay our annual licence fee, I've forgotten what it is now, it's about getting on to 200 bucks, in order to fund an organisation which promotes a view of the world which is essentially of the Liberal Left.
[00:32:47.752 --> 00:32:51.894]  You know, no organisation has been pushing harder for
[00:32:52.954 --> 00:32:53.714]  I don't know.
[00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:20.023]  They can't afford for anthropogenic global warming to collapse because their pension fund will collapse too.
[00:33:20.603 --> 00:33:24.085]  In fact, we've now seen the second wave of propaganda.
[00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:31.208]  Every issue of Newsweek, Time Magazine, New York Times, National Geographic.
[00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:33.608]  The global warming's worse than we thought.
[00:33:33.648 --> 00:33:34.629]  We're all going to be dead.
[00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:37.571]  Three years on the coastlines if we don't do this.
[00:33:37.951 --> 00:33:41.994]  Meanwhile, Al Gore just bought a giant mansion right on the beach.
[00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:46.917]  And we do see the stock on carbon trading companies going down.
[00:33:47.478 --> 00:33:56.384]  And the word is from the Bilderberg Group, from our inside sources, is that one member said, we're just about whipped on our global warming tax scheme.
[00:33:57.005 --> 00:34:04.390]  So I don't think that the king's horses or the king's men can put their global warming tax scam back together again.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.285]  Well, we have truth, justice, we have the facts on our side.
[00:34:10.506 --> 00:34:20.277]  They unfortunately have the structures that have been built over the years by organisations like the Club of Rome, which I'm sure your listeners are familiar with, you know.
[00:34:21.658 --> 00:34:39.454]  When you've got organisations like the Gorbachev Foundation, the Club of Rome, the Club of Budapest, the Club of Madrid, the entire United Nations, the entire European Union, the leaders of pretty much every major Western economy, including, you know, David Cameron, of course you've got Barack Obama.
[00:34:39.794 --> 00:34:41.796]  When you've got all these people
[00:34:42.977 --> 00:34:51.108]  ...supporting the idea of man-made global warming and, you know, imposing new tax and regulation to deal with it, you have a serious problem.
[00:34:51.208 --> 00:34:55.855]  Even if you've got the facts on your side, how do you resist the state?
[00:34:58.362 --> 00:34:59.463]  And they're not stopping.
[00:34:59.583 --> 00:35:02.605]  I mean, they don't care if their approval ratings go down.
[00:35:02.685 --> 00:35:05.767]  They don't care if you don't like naked body scanners.
[00:35:06.268 --> 00:35:09.530]  They don't care if you don't like home inspections.
[00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.871]  They don't care.
[00:35:10.951 --> 00:35:13.173]  They are clearly authoritarians.
[00:35:13.773 --> 00:35:18.757]  And more and more, I see newscasts all over the place where they imply that
[00:35:19.608 --> 00:35:21.489]  You better stop criticizing the government.
[00:35:21.769 --> 00:35:23.010]  You're going to cause violence.
[00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:24.690]  You're going to cause violence.
[00:35:25.371 --> 00:35:29.873]  And so they're selling this message of free speech causes violence.
[00:35:30.333 --> 00:35:32.254]  Therefore, we've got to ban free speech.
[00:35:33.424 --> 00:35:33.684]  Yeah.
[00:35:34.184 --> 00:35:37.346]  I mean, we could get very depressed about this, couldn't we Alex?
[00:35:37.646 --> 00:35:43.089]  We could all start, you know, predicting that, you know, global tyranny is definitely going to come tomorrow.
[00:35:43.629 --> 00:35:45.630]  I think we have to hold out a glimmer of hope.
[00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.810]  You know, you look at Australia.
[00:35:47.411 --> 00:36:00.397]  Australia is... the Liberal Party is probably about to defeat the Labour Party over there in the coming elections, which means that a Conservative administration which doesn't believe in man-made global warming will be there.
[00:36:00.797 --> 00:36:05.439]  That will give an example to those of us freedom fighters who don't believe in this conspiracy.
[00:36:05.739 --> 00:36:07.360]  It'll give us a chance to fight back.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.962]  I'm expecting, I'm relying indeed, on you Americans to overthrow Obama.
[00:36:12.002 --> 00:36:14.863]  If you don't get rid of him, then I'm going to be very disappointed in you.
[00:36:15.903 --> 00:36:17.484]  Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do in Europe.
[00:36:17.524 --> 00:36:18.224]  We are a socialist.
[00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:21.246]  Well, listen, I agree with you, but take Cameron, your new Prime Minister.
[00:36:21.266 --> 00:36:26.808]  I saw him a few months ago saying Brown wasn't doing enough on climate change.
[00:36:27.128 --> 00:36:27.849]  Yep, yep.
[00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:34.494]  It's hard for your listeners to believe, but we have a... Excuse me.
[00:36:35.515 --> 00:36:44.882]  We have a Conservative Prime Minister, a Conservative, who believes in global warming even more passionately than the Socialist administration.
[00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:45.923]  He's just booted out.
[00:36:46.243 --> 00:36:47.204]  He announced his plans.
[00:36:47.464 --> 00:36:53.369]  The first thing he did when he became Prime Minister, he announced that he wants Britain to become the greenest economy in the world.
[00:36:53.649 --> 00:37:04.231]  Well, you and I know that the greenest economy means the worst economy, because a green economy is no kind of economy at all, because it's based on alternative energy, and alternative energy is...
[00:37:04.668 --> 00:37:06.449]  An alternative to energy, i.e.
[00:37:06.489 --> 00:37:07.150]  no energy at all.
[00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.811]  It doesn't work, it's too expensive.
[00:37:09.091 --> 00:37:11.773]  The only way you can make it work is by fleecing the taxpayer.
[00:37:34.548 --> 00:37:37.730]  Actually, I'll tell you something very interesting, Alex.
[00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.531]  Everyone thinks that the Duke of Edinburgh, i.e.
[00:37:40.551 --> 00:37:43.813]  the Queen's husband, is a great believer in global warming.
[00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:47.394]  I can tell you for a fact that he doesn't believe it.
[00:37:47.694 --> 00:37:56.639]  In fact, the Duke of Edinburgh asked for a leading climate skeptic to give a talk at one of Britain's institutions.
[00:37:57.279 --> 00:38:07.508]  And, uh, the invitation was, was rejected, not by, it was withdrawn, rather, uh, not by the Duke of Edinburgh, but by the, by the left wingers on the organisation.
[00:38:08.008 --> 00:38:11.291]  Prince Charles is totally, um, on the wrong side.
[00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:19.398]  I mean, he's very much, you know, he's a great believer in Man, Bear, Pig, you know, he, he says rubbish like, we have a hundred months left to save the world.
[00:38:19.778 --> 00:38:25.263]  But, but his dad, actually, on this particular issue, is, uh, is sound, as we would say.
[00:38:25.834 --> 00:38:42.441]  Well, I have noticed that Prince Philip, and I disagree with most of his views on population reduction and the rest of it, I have seen him criticize nanotech and genetic engineering, because if you want to talk about something that could potentially get out of control, it is these cross-species crops.
[00:38:42.801 --> 00:38:45.402]  But you don't hear 99% of these environmental groups.
[00:38:45.802 --> 00:38:51.090]  With any concern about that, something that could have a potential, so I do have to agree with Prince Philip on that front as well.
[00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:57.961]  Let's take a few calls for James Dillingpole of the, well, writes for a bunch of publications.
[00:38:58.141 --> 00:39:00.926]  Rattle off some of the newspapers you write for on your website.
[00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:05.623]  I have a blog on the Telegraph.
[00:39:06.003 --> 00:39:07.624]  I write for the Spectator.
[00:39:08.164 --> 00:39:09.805]  I write for Human Events.
[00:39:09.885 --> 00:39:11.946]  I write for... Yeah, I'm a whore, Alex.
[00:39:11.986 --> 00:39:13.307]  I write for everyone who'll pay me.
[00:39:14.348 --> 00:39:15.909]  With the emphasis on pay, please, everyone.
[00:39:15.929 --> 00:39:18.210]  Well, you gotta get some pay to pay all those taxes.
[00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.311]  Let's go ahead and talk to John.
[00:39:20.812 --> 00:39:21.592]  John Calling.
[00:39:21.932 --> 00:39:22.733]  You're on the air, John.
[00:39:22.773 --> 00:39:23.473]  Where are you calling from?
[00:39:24.214 --> 00:39:26.975]  I'm calling from Northern Michigan, Alex and James.
[00:39:27.516 --> 00:39:31.158]  I heard a retired Secret Service and
[00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:42.273]  Kansas State Trooper, who lives up here in northern Michigan, talked yesterday on a program regarding a call he got from a sheriff in a rural city down along the coastline.
[00:39:42.753 --> 00:39:51.515]  And this sheriff, or chief of police, was a former military, and he says that regular Army has begun to come into their area.
[00:39:52.195 --> 00:39:56.857]  And the concern here with this gentleman, Greg Evenson, is that
[00:39:58.744 --> 00:40:07.031]  This oil spill is not only going into the water, but the chemical they're using to break it up is very highly toxic.
[00:40:07.192 --> 00:40:08.833]  Yeah, no, it's worse than the oil itself.
[00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:10.675]  Oil is 100% biodegradable.
[00:40:11.155 --> 00:40:14.278]  There's regular microbes already in the water that would eat most of it.
[00:40:14.838 --> 00:40:20.523]  They needed to block the estuaries where the fish have their hatcheries, where they breed.
[00:40:21.684 --> 00:40:28.669]  But the government wouldn't let them build those berms to block it and protect those key fisheries, and they're still not letting them.
[00:40:28.709 --> 00:40:34.192]  But I don't want to poo-poo what people are saying, and I don't know this particular person you're talking about.
[00:40:34.212 --> 00:40:35.453]  No, no, Alex, Alex.
[00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:36.473]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:37.514]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:40:38.155 --> 00:40:46.200]  I made phone calls two days ago to the places that were in these news articles I saw about all this regular army, and I called hotels.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.181]  And I called gas stations, and I said, are you seeing troops?
[00:40:49.221 --> 00:40:49.921]  And they said, no.
[00:40:50.581 --> 00:41:03.805]  What you do have is you have BP employees who are bossing, and this is on CBS television, BP employees telling the Coast Guard what to do at gunpoint, kicking media off the beach.
[00:41:04.165 --> 00:41:05.785]  So there is a cover-up going on.
[00:41:05.825 --> 00:41:08.606]  James Dillingpole, your take on that, and I'll go back to John in Michigan.
[00:41:09.306 --> 00:41:11.167]  Well, I hadn't heard that, Alex.
[00:41:11.207 --> 00:41:12.187]  That's very interesting.
[00:41:12.247 --> 00:41:13.888]  I mean, you know, I still...
[00:41:15.223 --> 00:41:24.029]  I don't see Obama, in this particular instance, being a sinister man trying to stage a cover-up.
[00:41:24.129 --> 00:41:35.537]  I see an incompetent man who is terrified of the angry calls he's getting from Louisiana, and he's desperate to show himself as a man who's doing something.
[00:41:35.557 --> 00:41:38.680]  That's why he's talking about kicking butt and things, which is soft luring.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:53.371]  All this nonsense about kicking butt, all this Brit-bashing, you know, it's entirely unnecessary, given that, you know, although there are 40% British shareholders in BP, there's also 39% American shareholders.
[00:41:53.411 --> 00:41:54.512]  No, I mean, that's asinine.
[00:41:54.772 --> 00:41:56.033]  It's a total red herring.
[00:41:56.334 --> 00:41:57.755]  John, what was the point you were trying to make?
[00:41:58.479 --> 00:42:12.025]  Well, he stated, and he does have a website later if you let me, I'll give it to you, but he talked about the benzene and the natural gases coming out of this spill, too, that's getting up into the atmosphere to become toxic and that they're planning that
[00:42:12.423 --> 00:42:17.364]  He says they're planning for a possible evacuations for at least a hundred miles and if not a hundred fifty.
[00:42:17.464 --> 00:42:30.948]  I've seen those news reports and I appreciate your call and we made phone calls and I mean in fact I'm gonna do this we have another guest coming up but after I go through these calls I'm gonna open the phones up only
[00:42:32.008 --> 00:42:40.331]  For people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, are you seeing troops running around getting ready for an evacuation?
[00:42:41.351 --> 00:42:51.154]  I mean, folks, one oil well, even if it's a half million gallons a day, is not... I mean, if Obama tried to evacuate, that's asinine!
[00:42:51.475 --> 00:42:53.315]  Evacuate because of some oil?
[00:42:53.775 --> 00:42:57.296]  Yeah, some of the workers are getting lightheaded because they've got the dispersant.
[00:42:57.317 --> 00:42:58.337]  I mean, give me a break!
[00:42:59.244 --> 00:42:59.924]  Here's a question.
[00:43:00.204 --> 00:43:06.167]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?

[00:43:55.622 --> 00:44:00.524]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:44:00.565 --> 00:44:05.928]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:44:06.168 --> 00:44:10.791]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:44:11.171 --> 00:44:11.571]  It's true.
[00:44:11.651 --> 00:44:14.253]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:44:14.473 --> 00:44:16.214]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:44:16.747 --> 00:44:21.435]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:44:21.976 --> 00:44:23.839]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:44:24.284 --> 00:44:28.886]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:44:29.086 --> 00:44:29.967]  And here's the best part.
[00:44:30.187 --> 00:44:32.968]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:44:33.269 --> 00:44:36.570]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.732]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:40.072 --> 00:44:41.973]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:42.293 --> 00:44:43.154]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:44:43.174 --> 00:44:43.394]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:43.674]  Remember,
[00:44:52.011 --> 00:44:55.614]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:44:55.914 --> 00:44:58.376]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:44:59.457 --> 00:45:00.078]  Fatigue.
[00:45:00.618 --> 00:45:01.099]  Headaches.
[00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:02.740]  Allergies and asthma.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.981]  Chronic disease.
[00:45:04.482 --> 00:45:05.903]  Is your home making you sick?
[00:45:06.343 --> 00:45:06.944]  Here's a fact.
[00:45:07.264 --> 00:45:09.085]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse.
[00:45:09.326 --> 00:45:14.930]  And the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[00:45:20.029 --> 00:45:20.370]  I think so.
[00:45:37.919 --> 00:45:39.359]  Call 800-499-2418 or go to airfiltersandpurifiers.com.

[00:46:17.847 --> 00:46:20.428]  He writes for The Telegraph, one of the biggest newspapers in England.
[00:46:20.448 --> 00:46:22.589]  We appreciate James Dillingpole joining us today.
[00:46:22.689 --> 00:46:23.470]  Great analysis.
[00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.350]  We're continuing with your phone calls.
[00:46:25.871 --> 00:46:35.395]  I've got a privacy expert coming on to deal with Google, Facebook, and others, and their admitted connections to the CIA, and just how they're openly surveilling basically everybody.
[00:46:36.055 --> 00:46:39.337]  Google's little white vans are doing a lot more than taking photos of your house.
[00:46:39.837 --> 00:46:46.180]  They admittedly are sucking in all the digital transmissions, mapping all the wireless networks, and surveilling you.
[00:46:47.165 --> 00:46:48.306]  That is coming up.
[00:46:48.326 --> 00:46:52.929]  And of course, Al Gore is on the board of these organizations.
[00:46:53.049 --> 00:46:54.970]  Al Gore is on the board of Apple.
[00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:57.591]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:46:57.711 --> 00:47:04.936]  Oh, and we have the iPhone, hundreds, or iPad, hundreds of thousands of their customers just had all of their data
[00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:08.152]  All of their names and information released.
[00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:10.415]  So that's the downside of the digital age.
[00:47:10.435 --> 00:47:19.606]  But going back to Mr. Dillingpole and your phone calls, and again I'm not poo-pooing troops down there in the Gulf, and Obama did say he was sending SWAT teams, which was bizarre.
[00:47:20.307 --> 00:47:20.908]  It's just that...
[00:47:22.634 --> 00:47:29.296]  I made phone calls, and the people said, there are no troops here, in the towns where they were supposedly all over the place.
[00:47:29.756 --> 00:47:40.159]  Now I've got a CBS News here, troops invade Chicago for training, downed planes, rail car crash, and simulated terror attack simulations.
[00:47:40.799 --> 00:47:43.320]  Now that's real, but I digress.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.721]  Jack in California, you're on the air with Mr. Dillingpole, go ahead.
[00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:51.022]  Hey Jack, how you doing buddy?
[00:47:51.042 --> 00:47:51.802]  You want to talk on air?
[00:47:53.183 --> 00:47:54.404]  Yeah, he doesn't want to talk on air.
[00:47:54.464 --> 00:47:57.246]  Truth Patriot.
[00:47:59.768 --> 00:48:02.790]  Okay, who should we go to next then?
[00:48:05.432 --> 00:48:07.053]  Kathy in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:48:07.773 --> 00:48:08.494]  Yes, hi.
[00:48:08.574 --> 00:48:10.275]  I've got a question for Mr. Dillingpool.
[00:48:11.256 --> 00:48:21.643]  I have heard the CEO of BP state publicly on television that BP will be 100% responsible for the cleanup in the Gulf.
[00:48:22.406 --> 00:48:31.613]  So, if this is the case, then why are we hearing that Obama wants to put a tax on us for cleanup in the Gulf, if BP is 100% responsible?
[00:48:34.235 --> 00:48:37.938]  I'm not sure what's going to happen in this particular case.
[00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:41.301]  I mean, I would have thought that BP will pay up.
[00:48:41.361 --> 00:48:47.866]  I think what is absolutely wrong about this is the way that Obama is using this to stoke up
[00:48:48.406 --> 00:48:53.511]  Anti-British rhetoric and to, you know, to talk about kicking ass and stuff like that.
[00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:54.813]  It's an absolute nonsense.
[00:48:54.853 --> 00:49:04.402]  Of course, you know, when a company pollutes and let's not forget that the actual rig that blew up was not being run directly by BP.
[00:49:04.422 --> 00:49:09.507]  It was being directed by a company called Transocean, which was actually an Halliburton
[00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:14.110]  And by the way, Halliburton's now based in Mumbai.
[00:49:14.811 --> 00:49:27.660]  All these companies are destroying the sovereignty of England, the US, and they're just dividing and conquering us, blaming it on Brits, when Brits have nothing to do with this, just like Americans have nothing to do with it.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.005]  Americans have nothing to do with the Federal Reserve, other than the fact we let this private group sit on top of us and abuse us.
[00:49:35.665 --> 00:49:37.326]  It's an asinine diversion.
[00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:38.007]  It's like
[00:49:38.727 --> 00:49:43.390]  MSNBC with their talking point that if you don't want government-run health care, you hate black people.
[00:49:43.791 --> 00:49:47.593]  It is a distraction and a divide and conquer tactic.
[00:49:47.874 --> 00:49:54.538]  So now it's the redcoat's fault that we've got an oil spill, and now you're a racist if you don't want government running your health care.
[00:49:55.799 --> 00:49:59.242]  He's sounding a lot like Chavez, isn't he, Obama, these days.
[00:49:59.282 --> 00:50:01.743]  I mean, this is a sort of classic Chavez behavior.
[00:50:02.104 --> 00:50:03.885]  You know, you've got domestic problems?
[00:50:04.325 --> 00:50:05.366]  Blame somebody else.
[00:50:05.406 --> 00:50:06.707]  You know, blame abroad.
[00:50:06.787 --> 00:50:07.688]  Blame capitalism.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.061]  Well, we do it too.
[00:50:10.101 --> 00:50:14.423]  They're now saying that Osama Bin Laden's in Iran, James, so we have to attack.
[00:50:16.264 --> 00:50:22.947]  And maybe if, you know, there's a housing project coming through and they want your property and you won't sell, James, they'll just say Al-Qaeda's in your house.
[00:50:23.427 --> 00:50:26.349]  James Dilling-Paul, I appreciate you joining us today.
[00:50:26.429 --> 00:50:27.249]  Always informative.
[00:50:27.529 --> 00:50:28.070]  Thanks a lot.
[00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:29.791]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:50:30.151 --> 00:50:30.471]  You bet.
[00:50:30.751 --> 00:50:31.051]  Thank you.
[00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:38.075]  We're going to come back, take a few more calls, and then we've got a guest coming on to talk about security issues.
[00:50:39.374 --> 00:50:44.384]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:50:45.025 --> 00:50:48.251]  We are the GCN Radio Network.

[00:51:51.767 --> 00:51:53.667]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:54.167 --> 00:51:57.028]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:03.909 --> 00:52:04.569]  Big Brother.
[00:52:05.209 --> 00:52:06.270]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.110]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:09.550]  You want answers?
[00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:12.231]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:12.251 --> 00:52:15.511]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:16.071 --> 00:52:20.132]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:22.645 --> 00:52:25.646]  I'm determined to really open the phones up about the oil spills.
[00:52:25.706 --> 00:52:27.226]  People can vent and get your take on it.
[00:52:27.767 --> 00:52:29.487]  How it's being used as a political distraction.
[00:52:29.507 --> 00:52:34.609]  How the Feds won't let the states fix the problem from day one.
[00:52:34.809 --> 00:52:37.109]  And there really were ways to mitigate this.
[00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:39.990]  But why are the states letting the Feds tell them they can't?
[00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:44.191]  I mean, if I want to brush my teeth, I don't call the White House and say, can I brush my teeth?
[00:52:45.672 --> 00:52:50.974]  Or if I had a broken pipe on my house, I don't call the Feds to get permission to fix the broken pipe.
[00:52:50.994 --> 00:52:52.214]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[00:52:54.284 --> 00:53:00.293]  But also, after we've gone through Avon, Jerry, John, Josh, Mike, and others, we got a guest coming up for about 30 minutes.
[00:53:00.874 --> 00:53:09.366]  After we've gone through these calls, I'm going to just open the phones up for 30 minutes or so to just get calls from people who are on the Gulf Coast.
[00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:10.027]  Have you had...
[00:53:10.908 --> 00:53:20.861]  Armed men, police, BP, military, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, tell you you can't be on the beach where oils come in, that you can't videotape it.
[00:53:21.042 --> 00:53:26.228]  Because that's on CBS and ABC, footage of men pulling up with guns, saying you can't be on this public beach.
[00:53:26.849 --> 00:53:32.356]  Get out of here, orders a BP, and it's local police or it's Coast Guard.
[00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:38.843]  We've got those articles and videos for now two weeks up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:53:38.863 --> 00:53:39.584]  This is outrageous.
[00:53:39.604 --> 00:53:46.332]  So I'm not saying it isn't true that troops are deploying and getting ready to evacuate people to 100 miles.
[00:53:48.564 --> 00:53:58.355]  I mean they had troops getting ready for total martial law three months before the flu popped up and telling locals it was for flu in January and nothing came of it and now the media admits it was a hoax.
[00:53:59.136 --> 00:54:00.978]  I'm not saying this can't go on.
[00:54:01.859 --> 00:54:05.283]  I mean hell they got military checkpoints popping up all over the country confirmed
[00:54:06.397 --> 00:54:18.980]  I just want to confirm it because I saw the names of the towns back a few days ago, and it looked credible, and I think it's credible for folks to ask the question if they're getting these reports, but I called up some hotels and places in the towns.
[00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:25.462]  I went on the search engine, looked up maps, looked where they said the troops were, and they said, no, there's no troops here.
[00:54:25.682 --> 00:54:26.502]  We wish there were.
[00:54:26.762 --> 00:54:28.203]  We wish they'd let us fix this.
[00:54:29.346 --> 00:54:31.950]  Then I'd call the Dairy Queen, I'd call the gas station.
[00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.233]  I mean, look, I get on the telephone, folks.
[00:54:34.273 --> 00:54:36.295]  I mean, I do some real work around here.
[00:54:36.656 --> 00:54:38.398]  My crew does a great job.
[00:54:39.528 --> 00:54:45.213]  And so, we'll open the phones up, and I've got listeners in every town along the Gulf Coast.
[00:54:46.154 --> 00:54:50.297]  And if we don't get calls that have seen the troops, then it's a fraud.
[00:54:51.038 --> 00:54:51.338]  Okay?
[00:54:52.159 --> 00:54:53.100]  Or a false report.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.083]  Or maybe there was a training exercise and people got spooked by it.
[00:54:57.123 --> 00:54:57.443]  I don't know.
[00:54:57.744 --> 00:55:00.866]  But if it's true, and it could be, it could be true,
[00:55:01.903 --> 00:55:02.983]  In fact, I had it in my stack.
[00:55:03.003 --> 00:55:03.804]  Will you guys reprint me?
[00:55:03.824 --> 00:55:04.964]  Because it comes from a good website.
[00:55:04.984 --> 00:55:07.185]  I mean, I like some of the stuff they've had.
[00:55:07.205 --> 00:55:08.126]  It's been a bunch of places.
[00:55:08.146 --> 00:55:11.707]  Will you reprint me now about troops getting ready to take over Gulf Coast or whatever?
[00:55:11.727 --> 00:55:13.288]  I already digress.
[00:55:13.388 --> 00:55:14.688]  It just gives me a big headache.
[00:55:15.228 --> 00:55:16.309]  Avon in Florida.
[00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:17.269]  You're on the air, Avon.
[00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.031]  Well, sir, it is an honor and pleasure to speak with you.
[00:55:22.151 --> 00:55:24.312]  I've been a fan for over seven years.
[00:55:24.392 --> 00:55:28.714]  I first started listening to you as a joke and to laugh at you, but
[00:55:29.324 --> 00:55:35.048]  The first time I checked into a couple things you mentioned, I found out you were not even exaggerating a bit.
[00:55:35.489 --> 00:55:36.870]  And I've been a fan ever since.
[00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.531]  No, I'm not making stuff up.
[00:55:38.571 --> 00:55:39.732]  Sometimes I make mistakes.
[00:55:40.512 --> 00:55:46.176]  And it is true, I'm a little eccentric and I've probably gone crazy from the stress, but, you know.
[00:55:46.516 --> 00:55:47.837]  I know that feeling, definitely.
[00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:56.344]  Well, I am here in Pinellas County, Florida, and just last weekend I went to a beautiful beach we have out here called Howard Beach.
[00:55:56.424 --> 00:55:58.165]  It's a state park, in fact.
[00:55:59.186 --> 00:56:02.790]  Very, very popular place, very crowded most of the time, and it was last week.
[00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:09.637]  I saw no oil, I was looking for some, I needed some for some lubricant, but I figured I might as well get it free while I could.
[00:56:10.457 --> 00:56:19.166]  No troops, I couldn't even find one of the police park guards anywhere, and I saw no sign of any problems whatsoever.
[00:56:19.186 --> 00:56:20.567]  And you were able to walk?
[00:56:20.747 --> 00:56:23.170]  You were able to walk and breathe without government helping you?
[00:56:24.502 --> 00:56:27.165]  Well, I think they might have been helping me without me knowing it.
[00:56:27.646 --> 00:56:28.487]  Thank God for them.
[00:56:28.547 --> 00:56:31.610]  But I've swam in the water, went on my float.
[00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:36.135]  Well, yeah, that's the issue is I've heard reporters from all over Florida going, I'm here looking for the oil.
[00:56:36.175 --> 00:56:36.756]  I don't see it.
[00:56:37.036 --> 00:56:38.077]  We're not allowed to fish.
[00:56:38.518 --> 00:56:39.739]  They're telling us we can't swim.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:48.304]  Listen, finish up, Avon, and when we come back, or Yvonne, and then Jerry, John, Josh, Mike, we're going to get to you after this guest comes on.
[00:56:49.084 --> 00:56:57.688]  But I want to cover first, because we really haven't gone over it enough, you know, the fact that it's just more and more admitted that Facebook and others are just government fronts.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.663]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:57:58.334 --> 00:58:00.615]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:00.635 --> 00:58:02.935]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:03.035 --> 00:58:05.776]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:06.156 --> 00:58:10.998]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:58:11.358 --> 00:58:15.539]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:18.200]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.721]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:23.662]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:58:24.003 --> 00:58:31.606]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:58:31.949 --> 00:58:37.211]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:40.132]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:58:40.172 --> 00:58:43.613]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:58:43.873 --> 00:58:44.814]  And I got news for you.
[00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.254]  You're everyone else.
[00:58:46.274 --> 00:58:47.275]  Invisible Empire.

[00:59:56.556 --> 00:59:56.996]  Thank you.
[00:59:59.457 --> 01:00:04.499]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.839 --> 01:00:07.120]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:09.267 --> 01:00:27.563]  Okay, for the next 30 minutes or so, we're honored to be joined by Bill Wagner, authors of Confession of a Spam King.
[01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:33.631]  He's been featured on Coast to Coast AM and many other TV stations, C-SPAN, you name it.
[01:00:34.252 --> 01:00:41.481]  And he is a researcher and is considered to be an expert on the internet and BillWagner.com is his website.
[01:00:41.501 --> 01:00:44.505]  But I said I was going to finish up with that one caller.
[01:00:45.666 --> 01:00:46.466]  And I gotta watch it.
[01:00:46.506 --> 01:00:47.907]  I want to apologize to callers.
[01:00:48.607 --> 01:00:51.427]  Yesterday I went into an hour and fifteen minutes of overdrive.
[01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:55.528]  I told all the Genesis callers to call my studio phone number.
[01:00:55.989 --> 01:01:04.090]  Then I proceeded to rant in a out-of-control manner for an hour and fifteen minutes, ended the show, and forgot I told you to call.
[01:01:04.771 --> 01:01:13.813]  Just like I'd just forgotten that I told Yvonne in Florida to hold, because I was going to finish up with him, and then was about to forget.
[01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:13.873]  So,
[01:01:16.642 --> 01:01:26.644]  I think I'm an institute of policy that if I don't go to your calls within 20 minutes when I give the number out, we'll just shut the phones down and clear the phones so I don't waste your time and my time, and I apologize for that.
[01:01:26.664 --> 01:01:31.025]  It's just my brain is all over the map, as I know yours is.
[01:01:31.045 --> 01:01:32.645]  I mean, the world is getting crazy.
[01:01:32.665 --> 01:01:38.067]  I'm like a guy in a batting cage with 50 balls every five seconds being shot at me.
[01:01:38.247 --> 01:01:39.387]  There's no way to hit them all.
[01:01:39.787 --> 01:01:44.288]  I guess I've got to decide which ones are the most important to hit and just focus on those.
[01:01:47.324 --> 01:01:52.625]  Ivan was finishing up with the fact that where he's at in Florida, he doesn't see any oil.
[01:01:53.065 --> 01:02:00.387]  And I'm seeing that in the news, so the media is separately hyping it, but then separately saying it's not a big deal.
[01:02:01.287 --> 01:02:04.748]  And it's just a lot of weird psy-op propaganda going on here.
[01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:08.749]  But where it is bad, in Mississippi and Louisiana, they won't let the people
[01:02:10.336 --> 01:02:16.003]  Back a month ago when they had a chance to stop a lot of this, build their own berms to keep them from getting into the estuaries.
[01:02:16.544 --> 01:02:18.947]  Because this can only be a federal operation.
[01:02:19.388 --> 01:02:26.777]  And by the way, we have confirmed that a bunch of National Guard are being sent down there.
[01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:28.119]  So Yvonne, go ahead and finish your point.
[01:02:29.714 --> 01:02:30.795]  Uh, yes sir, a couple things.
[01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:38.738]  Now, I just saw on the news a short while ago, a local channel here, they were showing stuff on the local beaches and saying, oh look, there's oil.
[01:02:39.019 --> 01:02:52.325]  But if, you know, I'm born and raised in Florida, what they were showing was the usual stuff we get, dead seaweed, little red tide stuff, and it was not oil that they were showing with the widescreen shot of the local beaches.
[01:02:52.345 --> 01:02:54.066]  Well, it looked like old tar balls.
[01:02:54.106 --> 01:02:58.568]  They were like, look, we finally found some, and it was tar balls, which are probably ten years old.
[01:02:59.881 --> 01:03:01.002]  Yeah, yeah, something like that.
[01:03:01.022 --> 01:03:09.229]  And I call myself Avon, after Avon Park, one of the original FEMA camps where I had the joy of living there.
[01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:10.450]  It's a FEMA military camp.
[01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:19.458]  I was there for eight and a half years, where I first started listening to you by a kind of a jury-rigged radio that I got my hands on.
[01:03:19.478 --> 01:03:22.141]  So were you part of the civilian inmate labor camp program?
[01:03:23.502 --> 01:03:23.962]  No, sir.
[01:03:24.022 --> 01:03:24.783]  Well, more or less.
[01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:25.664]  I was in prison, sir.
[01:03:26.348 --> 01:03:26.568]  Yeah.
[01:03:26.948 --> 01:03:31.290]  Well, no, it's just I know that they've openly had FEMA camps run by the Army.
[01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:33.571]  It's called the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[01:03:34.171 --> 01:03:35.652]  And it's just hidden in plain view.
[01:03:36.192 --> 01:03:39.013]  Just like our government admits they grow the opium in Afghanistan.
[01:03:39.253 --> 01:03:42.055]  Just like the CIA admits they put out fake bin Laden videos now.
[01:03:42.095 --> 01:03:43.615]  And it's just, oh, no big deal.
[01:03:43.635 --> 01:03:46.957]  But now the CIA says bin Laden's going to get us.
[01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:50.738]  He's in Iran with Saddam's WMDs.
[01:03:50.998 --> 01:03:52.759]  He's in a warehouse sitting on the nukes.
[01:03:53.099 --> 01:03:54.140]  I appreciate your call, buddy.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:54.780]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.524]  Alright, going to Bill Wagner.
[01:03:58.986 --> 01:04:00.247]  Confessions of a Spam King.
[01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:03.232]  And you know, I could go over his bio here, but that would take up all the time we have today.
[01:04:03.492 --> 01:04:05.255]  Bill, what's the best way to describe yourself?
[01:04:06.403 --> 01:04:08.484]  A crusade of retruth for this country.
[01:04:08.504 --> 01:04:11.306]  A crusade, uh, the Constitution.
[01:04:12.367 --> 01:04:13.347]  God family country.
[01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:16.229]  That's, that's the best way to describe myself.
[01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:33.500]  Defending what is true and against the people that try to destroy our daily lives every single day on the internet and try to track and hunt us down and read our emails and, you know, spy on us and do everything they can to try to destroy our internet experience and control it.
[01:04:34.401 --> 01:04:42.024]  Yeah, one of my favorite conspiracy theories is that I'm a federal agent and that I'm sitting there selling everybody's name to the government.
[01:04:42.444 --> 01:04:44.325]  Folks, the government built the internet.
[01:04:44.545 --> 01:04:46.006]  They've already got your name.
[01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:47.806]  They're already tracking you.
[01:04:47.826 --> 01:04:49.287]  Do you understand that?
[01:04:49.447 --> 01:04:51.068]  Alex, can I correct something?
[01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:51.928]  It's very important.
[01:04:52.248 --> 01:04:54.889]  BillWagoner.com is not me.
[01:04:55.209 --> 01:04:59.651]  That is somebody, one of these psycho crazies out there.
[01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:00.612]  Well, I apologize.
[01:05:00.632 --> 01:05:01.892]  That's what I was given in the bio.
[01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:03.613]  Give us your website.
[01:05:04.494 --> 01:05:08.221]  That's 888freedom.com That's my own 888freedom.com
[01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:13.933]  Because these people are insane that are putting Bill Wagoner up.
[01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:14.973]  So, 888-Freedom.
[01:05:15.213 --> 01:05:16.434]  Well, I apologize, buddy.
[01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.374]  888-Freedom.
[01:05:18.035 --> 01:05:18.835]  No problem.
[01:05:19.876 --> 01:05:23.297]  Yeah, I tell ya, the government does own the Internet.
[01:05:23.357 --> 01:05:25.318]  That's the thing that everybody forgets about.
[01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:28.320]  It was started by the military.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.701]  It's owned by the military.
[01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:34.103]  But the thing that gets me, Alex, is what I don't understand and what I'm crusading against.
[01:05:34.683 --> 01:05:38.246]  Is the fact that there's foreign entities out there.
[01:05:38.286 --> 01:05:41.950]  For example, there's one in particular company called Spam House.
[01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:45.413]  H-A-U-S dot O-R-G.
[01:05:45.433 --> 01:05:47.134]  They're out of the United Kingdom.
[01:05:47.695 --> 01:05:53.320]  Okay, and they're the ones that say what goes on in the United States.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.622]  They're the ones that tell America Online.
[01:05:55.642 --> 01:06:01.347]  They're the ones that tell every internet service provider that's out there what they can say and what they can't say.
[01:06:02.165 --> 01:06:02.906]  It's unbelievable.
[01:06:03.006 --> 01:06:04.709]  I've been dealing with this company for 16 years.
[01:06:04.729 --> 01:06:06.812]  They do nothing but blackmail and extort people.
[01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:16.086]  And if they don't like you, if they don't like me, that puts us into what they call a blacklist, where people can't even come to our site or even reach us.
[01:06:16.867 --> 01:06:17.448]  These people
[01:06:17.748 --> 01:06:18.268]  Well, that's right.
[01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:41.078]  They have these databases that taxpayer money pays for for government buildings, quote, free government Wi-Fi that taxpayers pay for, and Paul Watson's confirmed, one of my British webmasters, that on the big train systems and the train stations in England and Europe, most places it says you're not allowed to go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com because we're in the hate database.
[01:06:41.639 --> 01:06:43.820]  Yes, I'm in the hate database as well, Alex.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.500]  You're hateful.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.222]  I've been 16 years in the hate database.
[01:06:47.623 --> 01:06:51.827]  They don't like what I have to say and the reason why is because I won't bow down to these tyrants.
[01:06:52.387 --> 01:07:00.195]  I will not sit back and let the King of England, Steve Linford, that's his name from SpamHouse.org, I will not bow down to these guys.
[01:07:00.936 --> 01:07:04.220]  I will not just pay them off $150,000 and say, oh, leave me alone.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:04.540]  No.
[01:07:04.801 --> 01:07:05.221]  No.
[01:07:05.482 --> 01:07:07.384]  That's not the way America works, in my opinion.
[01:07:07.845 --> 01:07:10.028]  And I will not bow down to these people.
[01:07:10.468 --> 01:07:11.129]  No, I won't.
[01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:14.394]  And so you have Stan House at the top.
[01:07:14.434 --> 01:07:16.456]  They're the very top of the food chain, all right?
[01:07:16.877 --> 01:07:18.079]  Then you have guys like Google.
[01:07:18.819 --> 01:07:30.670]  Now Google, okay, and when I spoke in front of the federal government in 2003, I sat right next to the owner of Google, the guy that runs all the software right there, and I caught up in a slip.
[01:07:31.331 --> 01:07:42.260]  I caught up in a slip, and it's right on C-SPAN, and I just laughed, and I looked at this thing, and he told me, so I asked him, I said, so you're telling me, because I told him some things, and I said, so you're telling me,
[01:07:43.582 --> 01:07:45.184]  You make no money whatsoever.
[01:07:45.905 --> 01:07:46.906]  No money whatsoever.
[01:07:46.926 --> 01:07:47.907]  This is the guy at Google.
[01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:51.050]  I caught him on tape, and he says, That's right, sir.
[01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:52.572]  We make absolutely no money.
[01:07:53.292 --> 01:07:55.815]  And I just laughed, and I said, We'll see if they believe it.
[01:07:55.855 --> 01:07:57.016]  How much is Google worth?
[01:07:57.116 --> 01:07:58.217]  Eight billion dollars?
[01:07:59.439 --> 01:08:00.240]  Now we got under them.
[01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.924]  We have Facebook.
[01:08:02.944 --> 01:08:05.487]  No, no, Google's worth a lot more than eight billion dollars.
[01:08:05.507 --> 01:08:06.047]  Is it more now?
[01:08:06.087 --> 01:08:06.648]  Is it more now?
[01:08:07.028 --> 01:08:10.150]  Oh, it's just some... It's astronomical.
[01:08:10.651 --> 01:08:12.052]  I mean, goodness, Google Earth.
[01:08:12.452 --> 01:08:14.034]  Come on, you can find it.
[01:08:14.174 --> 01:08:15.475]  Google, listen.
[01:08:16.015 --> 01:08:23.722]  Well, that was NQTEL, known, admitted CIA proprietary development company that funded that.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.943]  I would not doubt that one bit.
[01:08:27.023 --> 01:08:33.237]  I know that Google, every email, every search that you do on Google,
[01:08:34.133 --> 01:08:34.513]  I think so.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:09:03.305]  It's more like a racketeering situation where you have a mob and at the top it's Spam House in the UK.
[01:09:03.325 --> 01:09:05.226]  Google listens to them.
[01:09:06.167 --> 01:09:09.609]  Then you have Facebook, Twitter and these other guys that operate under them.
[01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:14.252]  And it's basically, hey, you have to get permission to do anything.
[01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:15.512]  Anything at all.
[01:09:15.552 --> 01:09:16.233]  For example, with me.
[01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.020]  You know, I went to Washington, D.C.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.701]  for one reason, one reason alone, to protect the First Amendment of the United States.
[01:09:23.261 --> 01:09:32.885]  To say, hey, listen, not everybody out there is a big, bad, pornographic email marketer, or email spammer, or whatever you want to call it.
[01:09:33.245 --> 01:09:35.646]  And they labeled me everything you could possibly imagine.
[01:09:35.666 --> 01:09:36.687]  It's like they do to you, Alex.
[01:09:38.704 --> 01:09:44.090]  So I did this, and luckily there was a law passed out of it, and I protected the First Amendment then.
[01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:48.896]  But now, for some reason, all these companies say, ah, the hell with the law.
[01:09:49.396 --> 01:09:49.857]  The hell with it.
[01:09:50.077 --> 01:09:50.397]  Forget it.
[01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:51.839]  That don't mean anything.
[01:09:52.546 --> 01:09:58.547]  So these companies don't obey the law, do not obey the Constitution, and they just roll right over us.
[01:09:58.787 --> 01:10:03.649]  And we're mainly looking now at how they're trying to claim, you know, what can and can't be emailed.
[01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:06.729]  They're trying to expand that to calling blogs spam.
[01:10:07.109 --> 01:10:09.830]  Now your views on your own website are spam.
[01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:13.331]  They're trying to manipulate reality, but what you've really written about
[01:10:14.364 --> 01:10:19.807]  Is the fact that Facebook, Google, and others have all these government connections.
[01:10:19.867 --> 01:10:24.469]  And now it's come out the Facebook founder is bragging going, look at these stupid idiots.
[01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:28.210]  They believe that they get privacy with us.
[01:10:28.571 --> 01:10:29.851]  They believe they can trust us.
[01:10:29.911 --> 01:10:31.052]  What a bunch of morons.
[01:10:31.492 --> 01:10:40.876]  And Google's been caught all over the world, not just in England, with these vans running around capturing people's digital wireless communications.
[01:10:40.896 --> 01:10:42.117]  They're not just taking photos.
[01:10:42.777 --> 01:10:43.498]  Right.
[01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:47.524]  They store all the information that is going on.
[01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:48.466]  Do you have a cell phone?
[01:10:49.361 --> 01:10:52.123]  You know, a cell phone with a browser in it, or any of that, okay?
[01:10:52.243 --> 01:10:57.648]  They capture that information, put it into a database, they have everything about you, period.
[01:10:57.668 --> 01:10:58.248]  That's it.
[01:10:58.348 --> 01:11:01.811]  Google has been known, they've been banned in numerous countries.
[01:11:02.031 --> 01:11:08.517]  Countries are starting to wake up and say, you know what, you know, we heard this story, um, what was it, about a month ago, about China banning Google.
[01:11:08.737 --> 01:11:15.162]  Well, I don't blame China for banning Google, because Google wants to take their secrets and everybody else's secrets into their personal lives.
[01:11:16.883 --> 01:11:18.184]  I like my privacy.
[01:11:18.204 --> 01:11:19.585]  I like my privacy.
[01:11:19.986 --> 01:11:21.407]  And I know how to keep my privacy.
[01:11:21.427 --> 01:11:23.368]  And I'm going to keep my privacy.
[01:11:23.388 --> 01:11:29.533]  And when I do, when I write my book is I talk about how people, for example, I tell people who's behind what.
[01:11:30.213 --> 01:11:31.554]  What companies do these things.
[01:11:31.594 --> 01:11:32.295]  How they do it.
[01:11:32.795 --> 01:11:40.021]  How, you know, what, ways to protect themselves from the big bad, big bad brother on the internet.
[01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:44.465]  All right, let's talk about Facebook and Google and your research into them.
[01:11:45.606 --> 01:11:48.388]  But now, I mean, here's mainstream news about a headline.
[01:11:48.408 --> 01:11:54.033]  You know, Facebook, Google invented by the CIA.
[01:11:54.073 --> 01:11:55.014]  That's one headline.
[01:11:56.075 --> 01:11:57.676]  It just goes on and on.
[01:11:57.697 --> 01:11:59.238]  We're going to break it down.
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:02.681]  This is not a drill.
[01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:04.683]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:14.272]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:18.733]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[01:12:18.753 --> 01:12:30.077]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns under any circumstances.
[01:12:30.477 --> 01:12:37.783]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[01:12:38.123 --> 01:12:38.804]  But listen up.
[01:12:38.824 --> 01:12:45.008]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[01:12:45.068 --> 01:12:46.870]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:48.991]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[01:12:49.071 --> 01:12:49.572]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:12:49.592 --> 01:12:52.654]  Before they come for your guns, hideyourguns.com right now.
[01:13:00.191 --> 01:13:01.031]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:06.553]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:13:06.753 --> 01:13:07.174]  I get it.
[01:13:07.294 --> 01:13:16.637]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:13:16.917 --> 01:13:18.097]  That's not what's happening.
[01:13:18.318 --> 01:13:26.560]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.061]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:34.263]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.023]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:13:36.043 --> 01:13:39.285]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:13:40.005 --> 01:13:43.606]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:13:43.806 --> 01:13:44.527]  You should, too.
[01:13:44.707 --> 01:13:45.688]  Find out what they know.
[01:13:45.868 --> 01:13:48.770]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.830]  800-686-2237.
[01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:48.890]  800-686-2237.
[01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:49.271]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:04.553]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:14:04.653 --> 01:14:05.433]  What have we got?
[01:14:05.653 --> 01:14:07.774]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:14:08.095 --> 01:14:08.855]  A republic.
[01:14:09.115 --> 01:14:11.677]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:14:11.757 --> 01:14:13.678]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:14:14.018 --> 01:14:15.919]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:17.320]  So they think they own our land?
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.840]  They think they own our water?
[01:14:19.041 --> 01:14:19.441]  Children?
[01:14:19.641 --> 01:14:20.441]  Our education?
[01:14:20.781 --> 01:14:21.402]  Our money?
[01:14:21.622 --> 01:14:25.244]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:14:25.603 --> 01:14:29.267]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:14:29.307 --> 01:14:30.248]  You are being warned.
[01:14:30.588 --> 01:14:31.409]  We have the facts.
[01:14:31.609 --> 01:14:32.730]  We have the Constitution.
[01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:33.651]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:34.512]  We have common law.
[01:14:34.572 --> 01:14:36.814]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:37.093 --> 01:14:39.794]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[01:14:40.034 --> 01:14:40.874]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:14:40.954 --> 01:14:45.756]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:14:45.916 --> 01:14:47.297]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:14:47.437 --> 01:14:48.257]  Don't Tread on Me.
[01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:55.380]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.

[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.100]  We're good.
[01:16:06.209 --> 01:16:11.492]  Alright, but we'll have to have him back up again in the near future because we're almost out of time.
[01:16:11.552 --> 01:16:15.575]  Really interesting website and I was already familiar with his work.
[01:16:15.695 --> 01:16:16.736]  Very interesting research.
[01:16:18.417 --> 01:16:31.125]  Give us your website one more time and then in the remaining time we've got, go into the ways that Facebook and Google and others are A. government connected and B. just sucking everything up.
[01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:38.100]  Okay, number one, my website, thank you Alex, is 888freedom.com.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.840]  That's 888freedom.com.
[01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:55.925]  And through that site, you can go to my other site that I own, which I'm not going to mention, but you go through there and it shows you how to protect yourself from all of these privacy vampires that are trying to destroy and take everything from you every day.
[01:16:56.685 --> 01:16:58.287]  Now, the government owns the Internet.
[01:16:58.627 --> 01:16:59.588]  Okay, they own the Internet.
[01:17:00.109 --> 01:17:00.650]  They own it.
[01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:04.073]  There was a bill passed in 2003 called the Cannes Spam Act.
[01:17:04.554 --> 01:17:04.894]  Okay?
[01:17:05.935 --> 01:17:08.278]  And this law allowed
[01:17:10.003 --> 01:17:11.063]  Free speech to reign.
[01:17:11.223 --> 01:17:12.324]  Small business to reign.
[01:17:12.484 --> 01:17:13.204]  Supposedly.
[01:17:13.965 --> 01:17:15.905]  But, it doesn't happen that way.
[01:17:15.925 --> 01:17:17.546]  Spinoff's going to Facebook.
[01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:18.806]  Let's get really down and dirty.
[01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:19.447]  Okay?
[01:17:19.827 --> 01:17:20.547]  Let's put it this way.
[01:17:20.827 --> 01:17:21.287]  Anybody.
[01:17:21.927 --> 01:17:22.368]  Anyone.
[01:17:22.948 --> 01:17:24.588]  Anybody that belongs to Facebook.
[01:17:24.789 --> 01:17:26.929]  Anybody that belongs to Twitter.
[01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:29.110]  Anybody that belongs to MySpace.
[01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:31.011]  Anybody that belongs to Google.
[01:17:32.057 --> 01:17:33.159]  Anything you upload.
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:34.241]  Anything.
[01:17:34.762 --> 01:17:35.163]  Anything.
[01:17:35.263 --> 01:17:38.048]  Let's say you upload, for example, a show, Alex.
[01:17:38.589 --> 01:17:40.773]  A show of yours, your intellectual property, right?
[01:17:41.294 --> 01:17:42.917]  It says in the terms of service on Twitter.
[01:17:44.196 --> 01:17:45.978]  I can't read it verbatim, but I'm just going to tell you.
[01:17:46.038 --> 01:17:47.599]  They say they own it, yes.
[01:17:48.019 --> 01:17:48.220]  Yes.
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.241]  They say anything.
[01:17:50.261 --> 01:17:51.863]  Like pictures of my kids, for example.
[01:17:52.223 --> 01:17:53.023]  I didn't know this.
[01:17:53.244 --> 01:18:07.836]  I had to start investigating these guys really big time because they own... No, no, that's why suddenly Fox News, CNN, and others are showing YouTube videos because it puts your copyright into a no-man's land, which I'm happy because I just want to get the word out.
[01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:12.980]  But no, I mean, I read that years ago when I first started uploading five, six years ago to YouTube.
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:14.960]  They say, hey, we own your stuff now.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.241]  Yeah, but the thing is, how many people know?
[01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:21.782]  And that's the problem, is nobody knows.
[01:18:22.302 --> 01:18:26.043]  And, for example, everybody thinks an email is a spam email.
[01:18:26.103 --> 01:18:27.863]  Now, let me clarify what spam is.
[01:18:27.883 --> 01:18:35.725]  Spam is illegal activity when someone steals your computer to send out their garbage about pornography, and that is what spam is.
[01:18:36.983 --> 01:18:39.404]  Send an email to your friend or get your newsletter out.
[01:18:39.504 --> 01:18:43.065]  It's just freedom of speech and getting things out to the public so they know.
[01:18:43.625 --> 01:18:44.645]  But they want to shut that down.
[01:18:44.685 --> 01:18:47.506]  Google, the Google, reads everything.
[01:18:47.546 --> 01:18:50.787]  So if you put a word in there, okay, let's say you send an email to a friend.
[01:18:50.807 --> 01:18:54.788]  You're sending it from Google or you took to Google and a word that they don't like.
[01:18:55.289 --> 01:18:56.409]  Let's say FEMA camps.
[01:18:57.009 --> 01:18:58.510]  Let's say, whatever you want to call it.
[01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:02.071]  Oh no, we've noticed we can't get articles out with the name Bill Gates in it.
[01:19:02.651 --> 01:19:04.172]  They delist that automatically.
[01:19:04.212 --> 01:19:07.373]  Look at BP, how they just got caught buying the search terms.
[01:19:07.793 --> 01:19:12.515]  And a little guy like me, Bill Wagoner, I can't even send an email to certain places like Microsoft.
[01:19:12.935 --> 01:19:16.997]  Microsoft, when I got home from DC in 2003, late 2003,
[01:19:19.831 --> 01:19:20.272]  I think?
[01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:39.072]  Google, Microsoft Live, Yahoo.
[01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:41.333]  Let me tell you a real horror story here real quick.
[01:19:41.373 --> 01:19:43.814]  I had a friend of mine, okay?
[01:19:44.114 --> 01:19:44.995]  We know about Google Earth.
[01:19:45.015 --> 01:19:46.115]  We know it's all control.
[01:19:46.195 --> 01:19:48.536]  We know that you can find anything you want to find out, right?
[01:19:48.956 --> 01:19:51.197]  But now, they have this little plug-in on Yahoo.
[01:19:51.797 --> 01:19:52.798]  And a friend of mine called me.
[01:19:52.818 --> 01:19:54.058]  He said, Bill, you're not going to believe this.
[01:19:54.138 --> 01:19:54.639]  I said, what?
[01:19:55.239 --> 01:19:55.539]  He said,
[01:19:56.275 --> 01:20:09.660]  I opened my Yahoo box, a friend sent me an email, it showed his email, it showed where he lived, directions to get to his house, the whole nine yards, without him even asking for this, he didn't download Google Earth, nothing, and it's just coming up.
[01:20:10.461 --> 01:20:13.342]  So terrorists, anybody can find out where you live right now.
[01:20:15.725 --> 01:20:16.966]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:20:18.526 --> 01:20:21.127]  What movie you're going to see, they now know.
[01:20:21.147 --> 01:20:24.268]  Where you're going on vacation, they know.
[01:20:24.568 --> 01:20:26.289]  And it's all being watched.
[01:20:26.649 --> 01:20:36.712]  And from all the CIA people I've had on, like Mr. Steele and others, Google and Facebook were created by the CIA, by the Pentagon.
[01:20:36.972 --> 01:20:39.913]  And they're not just infiltrated, they are government.
[01:20:42.013 --> 01:20:43.595]  Yeah, and he had to look at the top, though.
[01:20:43.615 --> 01:20:45.296]  He had to look at the top, Alex.
[01:20:45.337 --> 01:20:45.897]  He really did.
[01:20:46.077 --> 01:20:49.921]  Well, look what Schmidt, the head of Google, said last month on MSNBC.
[01:20:49.961 --> 01:20:53.904]  He said, look, you shouldn't be doing anything you're ashamed of on the Internet.
[01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:55.246]  You have no privacy.
[01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.188]  Yep, privacy is dead.
[01:20:59.089 --> 01:21:10.801]  There's so many stories about these internet top dogs that were there and that say these things that your privacy is dead and if you're not doing anything wrong you've got nothing to worry about.
[01:21:10.841 --> 01:21:14.885]  But then they always make themselves exempt from their own technology.
[01:21:15.585 --> 01:21:16.026]  Exactly!
[01:21:16.066 --> 01:21:18.849]  The Lost, they go, oh well, you know what, it doesn't apply to us.
[01:21:18.869 --> 01:21:20.190]  It doesn't apply to us.
[01:21:20.671 --> 01:21:21.492]  Well, guess what?
[01:21:21.512 --> 01:21:22.573]  It does apply to you guys.
[01:21:22.973 --> 01:21:24.094]  And you know what?
[01:21:24.154 --> 01:21:29.840]  When the bottom line comes down, the people know, which we're spreading the word everywhere, and my
[01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:31.682]  Well, Bill, stay there.
[01:21:31.802 --> 01:21:36.606]  I'm going to do a few more minutes with you on the side, and particularly ask you where this is going.
[01:21:37.046 --> 01:21:39.308]  Because, you know, don't be evil.
[01:21:39.328 --> 01:21:43.992]  I mean, that was the NSA sick joke about their NSA operation, known as Google.
[01:21:45.313 --> 01:21:48.656]  Now people know they are evil, not just evil, pure evil.
[01:21:49.496 --> 01:21:50.397]  We're on the march.
[01:21:50.898 --> 01:21:52.499]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.122]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.755 --> 01:22:03.598]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:04.479]  What have we got?
[01:22:04.699 --> 01:22:06.860]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:07.881]  A republic.
[01:22:08.161 --> 01:22:10.742]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:22:10.823 --> 01:22:12.724]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:22:13.084 --> 01:22:14.985]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:22:15.105 --> 01:22:16.386]  So they think they own our land?
[01:22:16.786 --> 01:22:17.907]  They think they own our water?
[01:22:18.107 --> 01:22:18.507]  Children?
[01:22:18.707 --> 01:22:19.488]  Our education?
[01:22:19.828 --> 01:22:20.448]  Our money?
[01:22:20.649 --> 01:22:24.311]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:22:24.671 --> 01:22:29.318]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:22:29.639 --> 01:22:30.460]  We have the facts.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.782]  We have the Constitution.
[01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:32.723]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:22:32.743 --> 01:22:33.564]  We have common law.
[01:22:33.625 --> 01:22:35.888]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:36.148 --> 01:22:39.934]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:22:40.014 --> 01:22:44.817]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:22:44.978 --> 01:22:46.359]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:22:46.479 --> 01:22:47.319]  Don't tread on me.
[01:22:47.559 --> 01:22:54.424]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:58.467 --> 01:23:02.709]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:23:03.009 --> 01:23:03.629]  Number one.
[01:23:03.929 --> 01:23:07.090]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.930]  Number two.
[01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:12.752]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:23:13.112 --> 01:23:13.552]  It's true.
[01:23:13.852 --> 01:23:18.414]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:23:18.714 --> 01:23:19.274]  Number three.
[01:23:19.534 --> 01:23:22.816]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:23:23.136 --> 01:23:26.817]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:23:27.037 --> 01:23:27.578]  Number 4.
[01:23:27.838 --> 01:23:30.200]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.963]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:23:34.283 --> 01:23:34.484]  Number 5.
[01:23:35.064 --> 01:23:38.987]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:23:39.208 --> 01:23:43.972]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:48.278]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:23:48.438 --> 01:23:50.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:25:02.437 --> 01:25:05.319]  What Bill Wagner is exposing is so important.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:23.753]  There are open announcements that they want a kindler, gentler internet, with taxes on alternative speech, with government watchdog agencies that superimpose, through the browser on the computer, government counter-messages to quote, bring balance.
[01:25:26.513 --> 01:25:28.374]  We're talking about the end of free speech.
[01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:36.700]  And in public schools, in colleges, in corporations, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is blocked.
[01:25:37.861 --> 01:25:40.542]  And it's one thing if a private corporation does it, that's their right.
[01:25:40.722 --> 01:25:45.386]  But then they slander me, they defame me by saying I'm teaching hatred.
[01:25:45.946 --> 01:25:49.989]  And they say in some of the databases we've gotten screenshots of, hacking.
[01:25:50.851 --> 01:25:53.352]  There's nothing, or criminal activity.
[01:25:53.813 --> 01:25:56.874]  That's one of the new ones I'm seeing in these databases.
[01:25:57.475 --> 01:26:00.577]  And now the FCC is announcing they control the internet.
[01:26:00.997 --> 01:26:01.917]  They're going to regulate it.
[01:26:01.957 --> 01:26:03.378]  The FTC is announcing it.
[01:26:04.039 --> 01:26:13.384]  And they're saying openly that, oh, we're going to take your tax money and then provide you 3G and 4G nationwide.
[01:26:13.404 --> 01:26:16.326]  So the government not only runs General Motors and
[01:26:17.335 --> 01:26:29.232]  A lot of the big oil companies and, you know, has control over the banks now in this merger of corporations and government, this inside crony capitalism that we have, this fraud.
[01:26:29.252 --> 01:26:30.213]  It's not free market.
[01:26:31.425 --> 01:26:47.114]  Now they're going to take your tax money and compete with the other 3G and 4G networks, or do contracts, they're saying, with government, where the government gives contracts to run the, quote, public networks through AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and others.
[01:26:50.842 --> 01:26:54.804]  Our sites will be blocked from those as part of the filter protection.
[01:26:54.844 --> 01:26:57.105]  So this is what Internet2 really is.
[01:26:57.385 --> 01:27:03.888]  Going back to Mr. Wagner, from your research, what are some other ways they're planning with this cocktail of moves?
[01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:08.890]  How do you see them implementing all these announcements with cybersecurity?
[01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:12.312]  Obama saying, I may have to shut the web off to protect it.
[01:27:12.532 --> 01:27:14.113]  I mean, they're really coming out in the open.
[01:27:14.353 --> 01:27:18.635]  And how far away do you think they are from really starting to drop the hammer on us?
[01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:20.116]  Well, I think this.
[01:27:20.616 --> 01:27:25.640]  I think there is no way they could ever drop a hammer on all of us because of the Internet.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:37.349]  What they would do is if they did that, let's say Mr. Obama, that's what I'll call him, just Mr. Obama, is that he said, I've heard him say it, yeah, might have to turn the Internet off.
[01:27:37.369 --> 01:27:39.611]  But let me tell you what would happen if that was the case.
[01:27:40.691 --> 01:27:44.274]  It would create more hackers than he could ever imagine.
[01:27:44.775 --> 01:27:46.316]  Right now we have hacker problems as it is.
[01:27:47.299 --> 01:27:59.050]  Now, if he decided to shut the internet off, and say it's going to be all government controlled, everything we say, the FCC, FTC, blah blah, all this, there would be hackers everywhere.
[01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:05.276]  Do you think that people, I mean, I don't think people, I know that people always prevail, at least in my opinion.
[01:28:05.296 --> 01:28:12.163]  You know, I've learned things in my life, in my 16 years of doing this, of how to beat these people.
[01:28:12.843 --> 01:28:14.484]  Okay, I see going this way.
[01:28:14.504 --> 01:28:18.066]  I see Facebook dying, saying bye-bye.
[01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:21.108]  The more we talk about this, the more they're going to go away.
[01:28:21.128 --> 01:28:25.810]  I see these companies like Google, the more we talk about this, them going away.
[01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:32.314]  But this one company that we have to, if we can get one, this one company, this one organization off
[01:28:33.118 --> 01:28:33.659]  I think so.
[01:28:49.077 --> 01:29:01.121]  Well, isn't that just a rating service that is creating some of the databases that are creating the databases of what they say is spam?
[01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:02.342]  That's what they claim.
[01:29:02.362 --> 01:29:03.662]  That's what they claim.
[01:29:03.942 --> 01:29:04.262]  But no.
[01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:04.763]  No.
[01:29:05.383 --> 01:29:05.543]  No.
[01:29:05.943 --> 01:29:09.424]  They're the ones that tell these providers what to do.
[01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:11.465]  They're the ones that read your email.
[01:29:11.605 --> 01:29:17.027]  They're the ones that tell the companies, like I said, they're the ones that tell Google what to do.
[01:29:18.307 --> 01:29:23.532]  I don't know how these people in Britain get this power, but they are the ones.
[01:29:23.952 --> 01:29:24.492]  It's them.
[01:29:24.512 --> 01:29:30.877]  When I first started off my internet career, these people immediately attacked me.
[01:29:31.478 --> 01:29:32.098]  Immediately.
[01:29:32.118 --> 01:29:34.701]  I get death threats every single day.
[01:29:34.821 --> 01:29:36.162]  They're attacking me to this day.
[01:29:36.702 --> 01:29:48.570]  Well, I have to be honest with you, the stuff you're saying about Facebook and Google I have articles about, but I don't know enough about this organization to be able to say that they're the ones sending you death threats.
[01:29:49.451 --> 01:29:54.955]  Well, Alex, let me tell you, it's very hard to find out unless you've been there, you know what I'm saying?
[01:29:55.395 --> 01:29:57.757]  No, no, hey, listen, I've definitely got to read your book.
[01:29:57.777 --> 01:29:58.877]  Does your book cover all this?
[01:29:59.198 --> 01:29:59.698]  Yes, it does.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:01.301]  Well listen, do this.
[01:30:01.361 --> 01:30:04.363]  I appreciate you coming on with us and I appreciate you being on the show.
[01:30:04.383 --> 01:30:06.525]  I appreciate you bringing me on the show, man.
[01:30:06.725 --> 01:30:07.026]  You bet.
[01:30:07.086 --> 01:30:10.549]  I'm going to get your address and we're going to give you our address right now.
[01:30:11.289 --> 01:30:19.497]  And send me your book because I want to read that and investigate that for myself because I know about Google.
[01:30:19.617 --> 01:30:20.798]  I know about Facebook.
[01:30:21.398 --> 01:30:23.080]  I know about these other organizations.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:27.804]  I don't know about the group that you're speaking about and so I don't
[01:30:28.084 --> 01:30:31.726]  Really like to get into things that I haven't personally researched.
[01:30:32.106 --> 01:30:37.250]  And then we have guests on who expand on things, but that's very interesting.
[01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:41.272]  I'm sorry that you say that organization has been out to get you.
[01:30:42.032 --> 01:30:50.657]  Some other news that I wanted to hit on here, and a lot of this is up on GCNlive.com, is
[01:30:52.383 --> 01:30:56.085]  Publisher slaps outdated warning on U.S.
[01:30:56.145 --> 01:30:58.527]  Constitution founding documents.
[01:30:58.547 --> 01:31:02.169]  This article is also up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:09.414]  Warns parents that Declaration of Independence should be contextualized for kids.
[01:31:10.254 --> 01:31:13.676]  And it goes on to basically say it's an outdated old document.
[01:31:15.037 --> 01:31:17.279]  Here's a quote, this book is a product of a time
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:23.484]  of its time and does not reflect the same values as it would if it were written today.
[01:31:24.725 --> 01:31:27.708]  They also provide advice to parents seeking to educate their children on U.S.
[01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:28.068]  history.
[01:31:28.409 --> 01:31:39.259]  Parents might wish to discuss with their children how views on race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and interpersonal relationships have changed since this book was written before allowing them to read the classic work.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:48.184]  And so, they put out a copy of the Constitution, and God forbid somebody just read the Constitution for themselves.
[01:31:48.845 --> 01:31:58.050]  No, they've got to put an advisory on it, like, you know, parental discretion is advised before an R-rated or NC-17 movie comes on.
[01:32:00.011 --> 01:32:06.119]  We first reported on this about a month ago, but Fox News has picked it up now, so that article's up on GCNlive.com.
[01:32:07.461 --> 01:32:16.313]  And continuing, angry progressives shut down Madame Pelosi for not delivering stolen goods.
[01:32:17.475 --> 01:32:21.937]  And it says even the foundation-sponsored socialists are mad at the government.
[01:32:22.437 --> 01:32:34.663]  On Tuesday, a few of them gave Madam Pelosi a piece of their mind during an American Future Now conference sponsored by Campaign for America Future, a branch of the Democratic Party.
[01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:38.086]  And they want their free health care.
[01:32:38.106 --> 01:32:41.148]  Well, I'm sorry you didn't read the bill.
[01:32:41.208 --> 01:32:42.649]  The insurance companies wrote it.
[01:32:43.050 --> 01:32:48.934]  It cuts Medicare and Medicaid by $40-plus billion a piece, so $80-plus billion a year to start with.
[01:32:49.555 --> 01:32:53.758]  It allows insurance companies to lower the standard of care with comparative care is the buzzword.
[01:32:54.579 --> 01:33:02.365]  It does create the federal panels that set policy through computer directives to dentists, doctors, you name it.
[01:33:03.767 --> 01:33:12.873]  It just decimates everything and doesn't give coverage to children and people with pre-existing conditions.
[01:33:14.875 --> 01:33:20.459]  So yeah, you get free health care in Cuba, you get a bad knee, they give you a cane.
[01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:24.883]  You get bad eyesight, they give you a walking stick.
[01:33:27.244 --> 01:33:30.027]  Maybe you get a shot of steroids in the back if you've got a bad back.
[01:33:30.567 --> 01:33:31.608]  I mean, okay, so...
[01:33:33.601 --> 01:33:39.743]  Code Pink harangue Pelosi and demand Democrats make good on their promise to steal from the producers and give to the constituency.
[01:33:41.263 --> 01:33:45.984]  And again, these are kind of like a fungus that the New World Order releases of well-meaning socialists.
[01:33:46.004 --> 01:33:48.085]  I mean, they really believe what they're selling.
[01:33:50.345 --> 01:33:53.106]  And they basically sprinkle it like you put something on a crop to kill it.
[01:33:53.126 --> 01:33:55.966]  You know, the CIA's been caught doing that.
[01:33:55.986 --> 01:33:57.127]  They just sprinkle them out there.
[01:33:57.207 --> 01:33:58.347]  They produce big government.
[01:33:58.907 --> 01:34:01.648]  Then we go into debt to the bankers, and then we're bankrupt.
[01:34:02.796 --> 01:34:08.599]  And we're all dependent on government and then we all basically live in squalor cities with sewage running down the middle of the street.
[01:34:09.179 --> 01:34:11.060]  And areas of America now look like that.
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.961]  Many areas of Florida and California and Texas.
[01:34:14.381 --> 01:34:22.365]  And soon there'll be sewage everywhere except for armored compounds up on the hill where the tiny local wealthy people live who serve the elite.
[01:34:24.045 --> 01:34:26.406]  And so you want sewage and chickens running around the street?
[01:34:26.446 --> 01:34:26.806]  You get it.
[01:34:26.886 --> 01:34:30.187]  I mean, everywhere the globals take over, sewage and chickens running around the street.
[01:34:31.167 --> 01:34:34.108]  So, land of the sewage, home of the chickens.
[01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:42.310]  It goes on, it should be obvious by now, even to the far-left Democrats, that the federal government has no intention of implementing their socialist fairytale paradise.
[01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.930]  No, no.
[01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:47.851]  They're going to raise the taxes, keep the money for the bankers, and then cut your health care.
[01:34:48.011 --> 01:34:51.492]  And they're now protesting that as that dawns on them.
[01:34:53.021 --> 01:35:00.348]  And those of you saying that, you know, they're not going to get away with trying to shut the web down, you said they weren't going to get away with hijacking health care.
[01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:12.499]  By the way, I have people working in my office who have been pulled over without a current driver's license.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.701]  I've had one for six months, not current.
[01:35:15.689 --> 01:35:16.610]  It finally came in the mail.
[01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:17.731]  I renewed six months ago.
[01:35:18.391 --> 01:35:19.052]  It never came.
[01:35:19.372 --> 01:35:20.213]  Six months later, it came.
[01:35:20.273 --> 01:35:21.734]  For six months, I haven't had one.
[01:35:22.555 --> 01:35:24.997]  If I got pulled over, there's a good chance the cops would arrest me.
[01:35:26.958 --> 01:35:30.822]  But illegal aliens, and I've had the Austin cops tell me, they're told, don't arrest them for no ID.
[01:35:31.462 --> 01:35:31.802]  Okay?
[01:35:32.983 --> 01:35:40.490]  So, so, so, just remember that when I point out that this is
[01:35:42.163 --> 01:35:43.784]  All a double standard.
[01:35:44.444 --> 01:35:47.306]  And it's the same thing across the board.
[01:35:47.386 --> 01:35:48.726]  The government is lawless.
[01:35:48.746 --> 01:35:53.049]  And I brought that story up to make another point, and then I forget the original point I was about to make.
[01:35:57.851 --> 01:36:01.313]  I've got a bunch of videos posted today on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:36:01.353 --> 01:36:05.075]  Pro-Obama thug viciously attacks anti-bailout protester.
[01:36:08.305 --> 01:36:10.906]  Got that, but you won't see Chris Matthews running a report about that.
[01:36:10.926 --> 01:36:19.230]  No, he's running a report, and we have the script next Wednesday, where it implies, it says Alex isn't going to go out and kill cops, but his supporters sure are.
[01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:23.873]  I mean, what on earth?
[01:36:23.953 --> 01:36:26.454]  This show is not about killing cops.
[01:36:27.454 --> 01:36:29.535]  Neither is, I don't want government-run health care.
[01:36:29.615 --> 01:36:30.476]  Oh, you're a Klan member.
[01:36:31.096 --> 01:36:31.996]  What does that have to do with it?
[01:36:32.037 --> 01:36:33.357]  I don't want the government-run health care.
[01:36:33.377 --> 01:36:34.198]  They'll screw it up.
[01:36:34.978 --> 01:36:36.619]  It's a scam for special interest.
[01:36:37.688 --> 01:36:38.969]  Oh, really, racist?
[01:36:39.489 --> 01:36:41.971]  Tell us about the last Aryan Nations meeting you were at.
[01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:45.573]  Hey, I don't want government-run healthcare.
[01:36:45.613 --> 01:36:46.553]  Okay, I'll just shut up.
[01:36:46.593 --> 01:36:47.374]  Don't call me racist.
[01:36:47.454 --> 01:36:48.334]  Okay, fine.
[01:36:48.834 --> 01:36:49.435]  Take my money.
[01:36:50.896 --> 01:36:52.957]  It doesn't work anymore, folks.
[01:36:56.425 --> 01:36:59.227]  There's a Mike Adams report up on GCNlive.com.
[01:36:59.527 --> 01:37:00.208]  New research.
[01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:03.290]  Electro-pollution can cause diabetes.
[01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:05.992]  Of course, a bunch of other studies have shown this for a while.
[01:37:06.632 --> 01:37:11.556]  Most people are familiar with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, but did you know that researchers have discovered a third type of diabetes?
[01:37:11.876 --> 01:37:17.840]  Type 3 diabetes, as they're calling it, affects people who are extra sensitive to electrical devices that emit dirty electricity.
[01:37:18.181 --> 01:37:25.166]  Type 3 diabetes actually experience spikes in blood sugar and an increased heart rate when exposed to electric pollution.
[01:37:25.766 --> 01:37:28.807]  I saw research ten years ago about cell phones actually heat the brain.
[01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:35.050]  From things like computers, televisions, cordless mobile phones, and even compact fluorescent light bulbs.
[01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:37.331]  Notice all the reports of people getting sick from those.
[01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:40.012]  The government says it's the law, you must have them.
[01:37:41.465 --> 01:37:54.191]  Dr. Magda Havas, PhD from Trent University in Canada, recently published the results of a study she conducted on the relationship between electromagnetic fields and diabetes in an electromagnetic biology and medicine paper.
[01:37:54.771 --> 01:38:03.955]  In it, she explains how she and her team, I want to get her on by the way, came to discover this about why electropollution is so dangerous for so many people.
[01:38:06.963 --> 01:38:12.527]  And again, I was seven, eight years old and noticed that when I would brush my teeth, I'd get a headache and want to go lay on the couch.
[01:38:12.787 --> 01:38:15.609]  Nobody told me sodium fluoride was deadly poison, especially for children.
[01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:23.174]  Or that it causes an excitotoxin effect where other toxins and drugs and things are accentuated in the body.
[01:38:23.894 --> 01:38:26.076]  I just knew, man, this stuff makes me feel sick!
[01:38:27.076 --> 01:38:32.397]  Fluoride treatments, when I get them once a year, I would have to get nauseous and lay in the back of the car driving home.
[01:38:32.857 --> 01:38:34.217]  I get a headache just thinking about it.
[01:38:34.977 --> 01:38:40.598]  And everybody's like, God, these, you know, I want phosphorescent bulbs, but they're shutting down the manufacturer.
[01:38:41.078 --> 01:38:44.839]  You know, they put in fluorescents, they put in these new compact fluorescents.
[01:38:45.499 --> 01:38:47.020]  Man, do I get a headache around them.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.080]  Well, of course you do.
[01:38:54.941 --> 01:38:55.141]  I mean,
[01:38:56.786 --> 01:39:01.856]  When you put an AM radio near a fluorescent bulb, it buzzes.
[01:39:04.401 --> 01:39:05.964]  It's ejecting so much...
[01:39:07.133 --> 01:39:12.656]  So much electromagnetic radiation that it's causing AM radios to not pick it up.
[01:39:13.076 --> 01:39:14.237]  We ought to do an experiment here.
[01:39:14.277 --> 01:39:20.240]  Put it on, say, AM 590, which we're on here in Austin, and have the show on here.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:21.701]  Well, I guess we couldn't play the show.
[01:39:21.881 --> 01:39:23.762]  Play somebody else's show, because they do a feedback loop.
[01:39:24.662 --> 01:39:32.466]  And just take a fluorescent light bulb and bring it over next to the antenna when we're listening to AM.
[01:39:33.087 --> 01:39:34.207]  The show's coming in clear.
[01:39:34.587 --> 01:39:35.508]  Bring the light bulb over.
[01:39:39.104 --> 01:39:42.767]  When you're listening to AM radio and you pull underneath power lines, you notice how it cuts out?
[01:39:43.588 --> 01:39:45.650]  Because they're broadcasting their own radiation.
[01:39:46.831 --> 01:39:48.433]  They're broadcasting their own wavelength.
[01:39:48.873 --> 01:39:50.214]  I mean, they knew this in World War II.
[01:39:51.476 --> 01:39:56.300]  Guys who would sit in front of a radar dish sometimes would die a week later from it.
[01:39:58.482 --> 01:40:04.228]  They would put their food in front of radar and heat up a roast in front of a radar.
[01:40:06.107 --> 01:40:12.932]  I mean, anybody in radio knows you don't get near an AM or FM big transmitter, that it can burn you in the tower.
[01:40:13.392 --> 01:40:14.873]  You don't get near it when it's on.
[01:40:15.793 --> 01:40:17.314]  It's blasting radiation.
[01:40:19.216 --> 01:40:23.739]  Not the same as what comes off a uranium or plutonium bomb, but still damaging you.
[01:40:24.139 --> 01:40:30.903]  I mean, your eyes can only see a very narrow bandwidth of the full spectrum.
[01:40:30.943 --> 01:40:34.666]  You can't see what's blasting out, what's going on.
[01:40:36.752 --> 01:40:38.016]  Very interesting information.
[01:40:38.036 --> 01:40:41.104]  Again, this is up on Infowars.com as well as GCNlive.com.
[01:40:42.368 --> 01:40:43.932]  And it's, of course, from Natural News.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:58.331]  And the Health Ranger, Dr. Magda Havas, a PhD from Trent University in Canada, recently published the results of a study she conducted on the relationship between electromagnetic fields and diabetes and electromagnetic biology and medicine.
[01:40:58.812 --> 01:41:06.498]  It is, she explains, how she and her team came to discover this about why electropollution is so dangerous for many people.
[01:41:07.479 --> 01:41:09.060]  Blood sugar goes haywire.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.521]  See, it's bouncing off the cells.
[01:41:10.582 --> 01:41:11.722]  It's causing them to resonate.
[01:41:12.891 --> 01:41:22.864]  One of the most interesting findings in our study was that electrosensitive people, whose blood sugar decreases when they go for a walk outdoors, actually experience an increase in blood sugar when walking on a treadmill.
[01:41:24.646 --> 01:41:29.632]  Treadmills, you see, are electromagnetic devices that emit electrical pollution.
[01:41:31.352 --> 01:41:40.836]  But interestingly, because it's spinning, even the physical exertion of walking on the treadmill did not make up for the blood sugar spiking effect of the EMF submitted by treadmills.
[01:41:41.176 --> 01:41:48.218]  Despite the experience, in other words, type 3 diabetics experience significant spikes in blood sugar when walking on the treadmill.
[01:41:49.559 --> 01:41:50.879]  I mean, this is scientific.
[01:41:50.899 --> 01:41:55.741]  They're hooking them up in treadmills and the electromagnetic radiation is making their blood sugar spike.
[01:41:56.501 --> 01:41:58.182]  It's not being absorbed by the exertion.
[01:42:01.872 --> 01:42:16.343]  Dirty electrical systems, dirty electricity is bad for anyone, but it's especially bad for people who are type 3 diabetics, and Dr. Havas explains in her study that even having an electrical device plugged in the wall near someone who is type 3 diabetic can cause them problems.
[01:42:16.624 --> 01:42:26.151]  People that finally get off all the GMO, people who are dying, having liver failure, get off GMO, get off all this stuff, suddenly their problems are over, they're solved.
[01:42:26.191 --> 01:42:26.892]  I mean, we are just
[01:42:28.363 --> 01:42:33.527]  I mean, I am in here with all these fluorescent lights aimed at me, because we don't use the hot lights that can burn things down.
[01:42:34.147 --> 01:42:36.368]  I've got electromagnetic systems all around me.
[01:42:37.469 --> 01:42:40.091]  I mean, I'm just bathed in a jacket of it.
[01:42:41.872 --> 01:42:46.675]  Why do you think when you're out in the country, far away from power lines, far away from everything, you just feel so peaceful?
[01:42:48.476 --> 01:42:50.838]  Because you're not in the electromagnetic pollution.
[01:42:52.559 --> 01:42:54.360]  I'm going to come back, get to a few of your calls.
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:56.181]  We've got another guest coming up.

[01:43:59.469 --> 01:44:01.790]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:04.070]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:06.971]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:44:07.391 --> 01:44:12.153]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:44:12.493 --> 01:44:16.694]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:44:17.014 --> 01:44:19.355]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:44:19.455 --> 01:44:21.896]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:44:22.236 --> 01:44:24.797]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:44:25.158 --> 01:44:32.741]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:44:33.081 --> 01:44:38.345]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:44:38.485 --> 01:44:40.767]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:44.770]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:44:45.010 --> 01:44:45.930]  And I got news for you.
[01:44:46.091 --> 01:44:47.392]  You're everyone else.
[01:44:47.432 --> 01:44:48.452]  Invisible Empire.

[01:44:59.804 --> 01:45:00.465]  The problem.
[01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:02.607]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:45:03.127 --> 01:45:05.289]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:08.012]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:45:08.512 --> 01:45:10.154]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:45:11.015 --> 01:45:19.803]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[01:45:20.003 --> 01:45:21.785]  KaroStove has been in business for over 12

[01:45:49.251 --> 01:45:54.514]  Again, call 888-395-1164 or go to kerostove.com.
[01:45:54.655 --> 01:45:57.737]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[01:46:20.772 --> 01:46:21.772]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:46:21.912 --> 01:46:25.053]  I got Lindsey Williams on in the next hour about the oil spill.
[01:46:25.353 --> 01:46:30.375]  And of course he worked for oil companies for many years as inside sources that have proven to be extremely accurate.
[01:46:31.175 --> 01:46:34.216]  And so he'll be joining us to give us his take on that.
[01:46:34.236 --> 01:46:38.337]  He says he has exclusive information that he's breaking here on this radio broadcast.
[01:46:40.026 --> 01:46:50.890]  During that hour, I'm going to have open phones on the oil spill, and the oil spill only, because people want to talk about this, and I think it's important to discuss on so many different angles.
[01:46:52.370 --> 01:47:02.114]  But specifically, the phones are open for people who have seen military on the Gulf Coast, because it is true
[01:47:04.298 --> 01:47:15.505]  And it is documented that tens of thousands of National Guard have been dispatched, finally, 40-something days into this, to help out with what's going on down there.
[01:47:16.146 --> 01:47:33.337]  But I've gotten separate reports that are unconfirmed that they're preparing an evacuation of the area and that FEMA's going to take control of the entire Gulf Coast region from the eastern Texas coast area all the way around Florida and up the East Coast.
[01:47:34.462 --> 01:47:37.683]  Because the oil is going to go over around Florida and up the east coast.
[01:47:37.723 --> 01:47:39.023]  I mean, they know how those currents flow.
[01:47:39.383 --> 01:47:40.663]  And it's already going that direction.
[01:47:41.543 --> 01:47:44.504]  Just as the satellite models predicted months ago.
[01:47:45.084 --> 01:47:46.465]  Or several weeks ago.
[01:47:48.865 --> 01:47:55.806]  Now, FEMA did lock down New Orleans and didn't bring food and water for five days.
[01:47:55.866 --> 01:47:58.927]  People in the Superdome and wouldn't let people walk out over the highways.
[01:47:59.307 --> 01:48:00.787]  And ordered cops to gun them down.
[01:48:00.807 --> 01:48:02.988]  And then the cops followed orders and went to prison for it.
[01:48:04.206 --> 01:48:06.347]  Remember, that was a conspiracy theory the first few months.
[01:48:06.367 --> 01:48:09.528]  There were not police shooting innocent people trying to leave.
[01:48:09.808 --> 01:48:12.489]  Well, now those cops are in prison under FEMA orders.
[01:48:12.509 --> 01:48:16.910]  I'm not saying it was good what they did, but who's worse, those that follow the orders or those that gave the orders?
[01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:22.912]  Well, historically, those that give the orders are even more guilty than those that carry them out.
[01:48:23.892 --> 01:48:29.014]  It's like Bush saying last week on television, I would order waterboarding and torture again.
[01:48:30.129 --> 01:48:33.893]  Okay, well, you ordered people in Afghanistan and Iraq to torture.
[01:48:34.733 --> 01:48:37.036]  When they got caught, a bunch of them went to prison.
[01:48:37.536 --> 01:48:43.121]  They tried to bring it up in court that they were ordered to, but the Patriot Act was declared to block that from being in court.
[01:48:45.023 --> 01:48:47.606]  So, we better let them out of prison real fast!
[01:48:48.146 --> 01:48:52.811]  You know, if George W. can run around saying he'd do it all over again,
[01:48:55.305 --> 01:48:56.766]  This needs to be heard by a court.
[01:48:57.626 --> 01:49:00.027]  Or we need to release these people that did the torture right now.
[01:49:00.587 --> 01:49:05.549]  Because you can't have Bush running around free, while the people that followed orders are in prison.
[01:49:05.849 --> 01:49:08.690]  I mean folks, this is all common sense logic.
[01:49:10.591 --> 01:49:12.272]  And it really makes my head hurt.
[01:49:12.372 --> 01:49:13.612]  Some days I love doing the show.
[01:49:14.113 --> 01:49:15.573]  Some days I get frustrated and angry.
[01:49:15.893 --> 01:49:18.675]  And some days I get so frustrated and angry, I can't even think straight.
[01:49:27.495 --> 01:49:28.716]  It is really making my head hurt.
[01:49:28.776 --> 01:49:30.377]  I mean, physically making my head hurt.
[01:49:31.017 --> 01:49:31.677]  Well, here it is.
[01:49:31.777 --> 01:49:37.160]  Pentagon OKs up to 17,500 guardsmen for Gulf oil spill cleanup.
[01:49:38.001 --> 01:49:41.502]  And some of the first units are just now arriving.
[01:49:43.123 --> 01:49:49.026]  6,000 for Louisiana, 3,000 Alabama, 2,500 for Florida, 6,000 for Mississippi.
[01:49:50.407 --> 01:49:52.468]  And they just now announced this, OK?
[01:49:52.488 --> 01:49:53.789]  A couple days ago.
[01:49:55.029 --> 01:49:56.411]  And they're just now starting to arrive.
[01:49:57.092 --> 01:49:58.454]  So that's confirmed.
[01:49:58.655 --> 01:49:58.955]  Yes.
[01:49:59.015 --> 01:49:59.957]  And that's been on the news.
[01:50:01.079 --> 01:50:04.965]  What has not been confirmed is that they're preparing to evacuate and force people out.
[01:50:05.766 --> 01:50:09.892]  But I mean, as crazy as that sounds, no reason to evacuate from some oil.
[01:50:12.352 --> 01:50:15.674]  FEMA will use any excuse to set the precedent that it's the boss.
[01:50:16.354 --> 01:50:19.035]  And that's why they love this oil spill going on forever.
[01:50:19.275 --> 01:50:24.998]  But I don't want to hear Jindal and everybody complaining about the Fed's non-response and saying we're not allowed to.
[01:50:25.438 --> 01:50:26.779]  Boo-hoo, the Feds won't let us.
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:30.201]  Well, then, you've got the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[01:50:31.041 --> 01:50:33.763]  You know, the federal government is not there to blow your nose.
[01:50:34.883 --> 01:50:37.845]  But the federal government's saying you're not allowed to blow your own nose.
[01:50:37.865 --> 01:50:38.585]  They've got to do it.
[01:50:40.615 --> 01:50:42.442]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:43.887 --> 01:50:46.094]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:49.281 --> 01:50:51.884]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:50:52.284 --> 01:50:57.249]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:50:57.609 --> 01:50:59.351]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:50:59.671 --> 01:51:04.476]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:51:04.676 --> 01:51:05.637]  How much do you want?
[01:51:05.857 --> 01:51:06.598]  When do you want it?
[01:51:06.978 --> 01:51:08.579]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:09.680]  When will you need it?
[01:51:09.941 --> 01:51:12.003]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:51:12.143 --> 01:51:13.124]  Will there be any food?
[01:51:13.464 --> 01:51:17.366]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:51:17.526 --> 01:51:20.047]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:51:20.267 --> 01:51:23.449]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:51:23.829 --> 01:51:27.330]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:51:27.651 --> 01:51:28.631]  How much will you need?
[01:51:28.891 --> 01:51:29.491]  We don't know.
[01:51:29.792 --> 01:51:30.712]  How much do you want?
[01:51:30.892 --> 01:51:31.632]  All you can get.
[01:51:31.813 --> 01:51:32.633]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:32.913 --> 01:51:35.676]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:51:35.956 --> 01:51:36.316]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:36.476 --> 01:51:38.138]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:39.159]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:39.179 --> 01:51:40.340]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:42.201]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:03.066 --> 01:52:03.146]  Yeah.
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:20.025]  Well, Pastor Lindsey Williams is with us in this fourth and final hour today.
[01:52:20.045 --> 01:52:32.196]  He, of course, was a pastor in the oil fields back in the seventies in Alaska, and then was brought in to be the chaplain in between these large corporate meetings between CEOs.
[01:52:32.776 --> 01:52:36.139]  He wrote a book, Energy Non-Crisis, that was a bestseller.
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:38.241]  It's now become mainstream news that
[01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:44.085]  A very small portion of the oil that is brought out of Alaska is used in the U.S.
[01:52:44.125 --> 01:52:44.565]  about 20%.
[01:52:45.345 --> 01:52:51.348]  Some years it's 25%, but normally about 80% gets shipped out to Asia.
[01:52:52.569 --> 01:52:56.031]  And they can build more pipelines, there's more oil there than in Saudi Arabia.
[01:52:56.531 --> 01:52:57.392]  That's now admitted.
[01:52:57.812 --> 01:53:00.633]  They covered it up for 25 years now, it's been admitted.
[01:53:01.654 --> 01:53:05.336]  Obama announces they're going to allow drilling, and then magically
[01:53:06.616 --> 01:53:09.801]  BP CEO dumps a third of his stock.
[01:53:09.901 --> 01:53:16.472]  Goldman Sachs, who was the chairman of Goldman Sachs, just so happened to be the international chairman of...
[01:53:17.438 --> 01:53:17.678]  B.P.
[01:53:37.313 --> 01:53:42.075]  We know he's in the Washington Post saying he wants to get a carbon tax passed now to pay for this.
[01:53:43.396 --> 01:53:45.777]  So, it is really bizarre.
[01:53:45.897 --> 01:53:50.519]  And in this hour, we're going to go to your phone calls.
[01:53:51.339 --> 01:53:57.242]  Gary, John, Terry, who's a petroleum engineer for 12 years, Matt in Ohio, Mike in Mass,
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:02.721]  And the petroleum engineer says they're a 12-year insider with Halliburton.
[01:54:02.941 --> 01:54:06.062]  So we're going to intersperse calls with Lindsey Williams.
[01:54:06.082 --> 01:54:08.843]  And I'm going to go to the petroleum engineer and we come back in the next segment.
[01:54:09.363 --> 01:54:11.204]  So we're limited on time today, Lindsey.
[01:54:11.224 --> 01:54:12.604]  We appreciate you breaking this here.
[01:54:12.964 --> 01:54:17.106]  So can you give us a boil-down synopsis of the information in total?
[01:54:17.366 --> 01:54:21.287]  And then over the hour, we'll go through different facets of it in more detail.
[01:54:22.742 --> 01:54:24.624]  Alex, thank you for letting me be with you.
[01:54:24.824 --> 01:54:33.052]  I contacted Mr. X with my book, The Energy Non-Crisis, for the truth of what really happened and is happening.
[01:54:33.832 --> 01:54:35.494]  He was willing to tell me everything.
[01:54:36.014 --> 01:54:36.855]  And what he told me?
[01:54:37.496 --> 01:54:47.445]  I knew that the Alex Jones Show is the only place that I can get this information out to the masses quick enough before they can stop it from being given.
[01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:56.092]  He basically told me what happened, and what is happening, and what is going to happen in the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher.
[01:54:58.713 --> 01:55:02.234]  Well, Lindsey, I'm almost holding my breath.
[01:55:02.834 --> 01:55:06.074]  I almost don't want to know, but tell us what he said.
[01:55:07.655 --> 01:55:11.936]  Well, first of all, what people are going to hear on your show today is catastrophic.
[01:55:12.696 --> 01:55:16.057]  I beg of them to get a pencil and piece of paper and take notes.
[01:55:16.813 --> 01:55:20.355]  And send this program to every person you know.
[01:55:20.375 --> 01:55:34.221]  The people of America must know the truth about the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher because the oil is not, I hope you're hearing this word, the oil is not the greatest danger.
[01:55:34.261 --> 01:55:40.944]  That black stuff in the water that comes up with the oil is what is deadly.
[01:55:41.696 --> 01:55:50.450]  The oil itself only destroys wildlife and fish and oysters and shrimp and the pristine white beaches and the marshlands and the coral reefs.
[01:55:50.831 --> 01:55:53.495]  What comes out with that gusher?
[01:55:54.455 --> 01:55:58.276]  ...is causing the death of humans and unborn babies.
[01:55:58.816 --> 01:56:06.538]  And I'm going to give the details of this today, exactly as was given to me by the Mr. X from my book, The Energy Non-Crisis.
[01:56:07.118 --> 01:56:18.320]  And, please, folks, believe me, this is so catastrophic that I have never had anything like this in my years to ever come my way.
[01:56:20.066 --> 01:56:30.274]  Well, again, this is a former oil company CEO and you've certainly got good intel from him before when fuel was at $55 a barrel in early 2008.
[01:56:32.796 --> 01:56:34.577]  You talked to him and he said it was going to go up to $150.
[01:56:34.737 --> 01:56:35.738]  It did do that.
[01:56:36.058 --> 01:56:37.780]  People laughed at you at the time.
[01:56:39.494 --> 01:56:50.988]  I hope he's wrong about this, but we'll get your breakdown of this on the other side, then we'll talk to Terry in Ohio, Gary, John, Matt, Mike, and everybody else.
[01:56:51.388 --> 01:56:52.109]  Everybody stay there.
[01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.910]  We're going to get to you.
[01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:55.934]  Coming up, but first, Lindsey Williams on the other side.
[01:57:00.592 --> 01:57:04.213]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:04.553 --> 01:57:12.675]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:57:13.416 --> 01:57:17.457]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:57:18.037 --> 01:57:28.860]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:38.502]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:39.002 --> 01:57:44.063]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:51.605]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:51.925 --> 01:57:54.666]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:57:58.439 --> 01:58:02.682]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:02.982 --> 01:58:03.263]  Number 1.
[01:58:03.903 --> 01:58:07.065]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:07.326 --> 01:58:07.886]  Number 2.
[01:58:08.186 --> 01:58:12.730]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:58:13.090 --> 01:58:13.530]  It's true.
[01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:18.394]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:58:18.694 --> 01:58:19.254]  Number 3.
[01:58:19.535 --> 01:58:22.817]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:58:23.117 --> 01:58:26.820]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:27.561]  Number 4.
[01:58:27.801 --> 01:58:30.164]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:58:30.564 --> 01:58:33.949]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:58:34.249 --> 01:58:34.790]  Number 5.
[01:58:35.050 --> 01:58:38.975]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:58:39.195 --> 01:58:43.961]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:57.443]  Thank you.
[01:59:59.984 --> 02:00:02.186]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:00:02.206 --> 02:00:05.548]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:08.075 --> 02:00:18.324]  Well, Lindsey Williams has made predictions that have come true time and time again, just like other analysts we have on, like Gerald Solente yesterday.
[02:00:18.384 --> 02:00:21.367]  But this isn't really somebody analyzing you, though he's a smart guy.
[02:00:21.787 --> 02:00:25.250]  This is a former oil company CEO.
[02:00:26.651 --> 02:00:29.733]  That Lindsey worked with for many years that is a globalist.
[02:00:29.753 --> 02:00:39.059]  That's a good source of info and So it's some insider info and and and so he's gonna give us a synopsis that I'm gonna take some calls Then he's gonna flush it out in more detail
[02:00:40.202 --> 02:00:44.743]  But Lindsey, they have said a lot of the workers are getting sick or cleaning this up.
[02:00:44.843 --> 02:00:49.705]  I thought it was because of the dispersant they're using, which they admit is much more toxic than crude oil.
[02:00:50.085 --> 02:00:54.546]  I know some toxic things come out of certain types of wells, especially deep wells.
[02:00:55.106 --> 02:01:00.387]  But you were telling me, and now even the EPA today, you were trying to get a hold of me last week, but here you are now.
[02:01:00.828 --> 02:01:02.208]  Now the EPA has come out.
[02:01:03.088 --> 02:01:09.070]  And said, yeah, there's a bunch of other toxic stuff coming out in this half million gallons a day.
[02:01:09.110 --> 02:01:12.531]  And people noticed a lot of times black isn't coming out of the hole.
[02:01:12.912 --> 02:01:17.873]  Brown and green and, of course, from undersea cameras it distorts the colors.
[02:01:17.933 --> 02:01:22.135]  But other stuff, other than oil, clearly is coming out.
[02:01:22.155 --> 02:01:24.956]  And people are saying, you know, is it a mud volcano?
[02:01:24.976 --> 02:01:26.496]  You know, what is it?
[02:01:26.536 --> 02:01:30.678]  And now there's two other fissures, they've confirmed, miles away leaking.
[02:01:31.518 --> 02:01:42.966]  And we know sometimes, like in the Beverly Hillbillies, I mean it's fiction, but Jed Clampett shoots at a squirrel and up from the ground came a bubbling crude Texas tea, black gold.
[02:01:45.067 --> 02:01:51.432]  So in a lot of cases in the U.S., La Brea Tar Pit in L.A., oil comes up on its own on the seabed.
[02:01:51.792 --> 02:01:55.534]  So did they get into some mega-fisher or something?
[02:01:56.415 --> 02:02:01.058]  Break it down for us from your inside sources exactly what's going on here, Lindsey Williams.
[02:02:02.019 --> 02:02:07.527]  Alex, please allow me to give just a very brief background to what happened in the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:02:07.547 --> 02:02:08.609]  Sure, you've got the floor.
[02:02:08.849 --> 02:02:11.874]  And then we're going to get a call from somebody who says they're a Halliburton insider.
[02:02:11.894 --> 02:02:12.194]  Go ahead.
[02:02:12.895 --> 02:02:15.839]  Okay, in 1970, the Russians drilled that coal at SG-3 Wells.
[02:02:17.962 --> 02:02:23.747]  An exploratory well which finally reached a staggering world record depth of 40,230 feet.
[02:02:24.287 --> 02:02:33.954]  Since then, Russia and their major oil company, Yukos, have quietly drilled 310 successfully deep wells, putting them into production.
[02:02:34.014 --> 02:02:42.461]  And last year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the world's largest single oil producer and is now set to completely dominate global oil production.
[02:02:43.221 --> 02:02:43.541]  I think so.
[02:03:06.034 --> 02:03:16.342]  And there is no such thing as peak oil, and the shallow oil wells of Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Mexico are replenishing from these deep sources.
[02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:21.726]  Now Russia had sense enough, and please notice this word, it's emphatic.
[02:03:22.206 --> 02:03:26.610]  Russia had sense enough to drill their coal SG-3 well on the land.
[02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:29.091]  Not in the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:03:29.491 --> 02:03:32.113]  Now, what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico?
[02:03:32.133 --> 02:03:37.075]  I contacted Mr. X and he said, here's what happened.
[02:03:37.495 --> 02:03:39.596]  What I found out is frightening.
[02:03:39.616 --> 02:03:40.557]  I mean, it scares me.
[02:03:40.937 --> 02:03:48.561]  It appears that British Petroleum, BP, not an American oil company, it should have never been allowed to take place.
[02:03:48.721 --> 02:03:50.582]  Our government made a horrible mistake.
[02:03:51.062 --> 02:04:09.754]  They allowed British Petroleum to try to do what Russia did, and drill a super deep well, not on land, but, you stupid, BP was so stupid as to try drilling in the ocean, offshore, on a floating platform.
[02:04:09.774 --> 02:04:11.155]  Are you catching all of these words?
[02:04:11.575 --> 02:04:16.418]  This platform is controlled and kept in place by sophisticated GPS equipment.
[02:04:17.106 --> 02:04:21.750]  In the Gulf of Mexico, in wherever, that's 5,000 feet deep.
[02:04:21.911 --> 02:04:29.738]  Yeah, it's got big robotically controlled jets and propellers, just like cruise ships have to keep them from rocking.
[02:04:30.158 --> 02:04:35.143]  It has a similar system, it's firing, I think they call it an azapod system, to keep it in place.
[02:04:36.172 --> 02:04:36.432]  Yes.
[02:04:36.772 --> 02:04:39.813]  They... Now, keep in mind, one mile is 5,280.
[02:04:39.853 --> 02:04:47.254]  They went down 5,000 feet in water, and then they began their drilling, and here's the depth they went to.
[02:04:47.274 --> 02:04:56.836]  This is right from BP's... Now, there are some people in BP that are so concerned for human beings and love our nation to the point that they have told me the story.
[02:04:56.896 --> 02:05:02.217]  I had two BP informants along with my Mr. X of Energy Non-Crisis.
[02:05:03.129 --> 02:05:09.494]  They drilled between 25 and 30,000 feet deep in 5,000 foot water.
[02:05:09.854 --> 02:05:13.257]  That means that they went somewhere between 30 and 30,000 feet.
[02:05:13.557 --> 02:05:15.539]  This is what is called a super deep well.
[02:05:15.919 --> 02:05:21.623]  They hit something so catastrophic and unexpected that they could not contain it.
[02:05:21.683 --> 02:05:32.672]  And the news has now admitted that three hours before, they had executives and engineers and petroleum geologists rushing out there on helicopters because they knew something was about to happen.
[02:05:33.345 --> 02:05:37.730]  That's exactly right, and it did, except it was much worse than they ever thought for.
[02:05:38.170 --> 02:05:44.537]  Now, let me state very emphatically, this positively is not a conspiracy.
[02:05:45.077 --> 02:05:47.400]  They did not intend for this to happen.
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:49.162]  This is an accident.
[02:05:49.602 --> 02:05:55.929]  They hit a straddle of oil at such high pressure that it burst all of their safety valves.
[02:05:56.389 --> 02:06:03.233]  The pressure behind the oil is so high that it destroyed the maximum efforts of human science to contain it.
[02:06:03.933 --> 02:06:13.418]  And at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, for instance, the oil is in the ground at approximately 1,500 pounds of natural location pressure.
[02:06:14.259 --> 02:06:17.701]  And when I was chaplain there, I watched many oil wells being brought in.
[02:06:18.436 --> 02:06:26.040]  The very first thing that they gave in an oil well at Prudhoe Bay was the flow rate of the wellhead.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:32.943]  The second thing they would always give immediately is the pressure, the artesian pressure coming up with that oil.
[02:06:33.383 --> 02:06:39.606]  Have you ever noticed, and now you can think of this for a moment Alex, nowhere, no media, nobody,
[02:06:40.266 --> 02:06:49.413]  No, that is the first thing they do, is they get a well reading on its pressure, and we haven't heard what pressure it's coming out.
[02:07:01.495 --> 02:07:09.518]  But see, that fits in with the fact that there's other fissures miles away that it's coming up with such pressure, like a water hose going into the dirt can burrow.
[02:07:10.219 --> 02:07:15.641]  It's coming up from below and blasting up, almost like a volcano, creating other fissures.
[02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:19.642]  But we're going to find out from a fellow that says they're a petroleum geologist just in a moment.
[02:07:19.662 --> 02:07:20.983]  But please continue, Lindsey.
[02:07:21.721 --> 02:07:27.885]  Yes, keep in mind that the tire on your automobile is 35 pounds per square inch approximately.
[02:07:27.925 --> 02:07:33.129]  If you were driving a tractor-trailer rig, you'd have 100 pounds per square inch, PSI.
[02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:36.912]  A reliable source, estimated to me, with BP,
[02:07:37.612 --> 02:07:43.293]  That the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher hit a wellhead pressure between, you ready?
[02:07:44.534 --> 02:07:45.934]  This is astronomical.
[02:07:46.354 --> 02:07:53.476]  They hit a wellhead pressure of somewhere between 20,000 and 70,000 pounds per square inch.
[02:07:53.956 --> 02:07:57.076]  This is beyond human technology to contain it.
[02:07:57.616 --> 02:08:00.037]  There are many safety devices on that well.
[02:08:00.057 --> 02:08:01.557]  It blew every single one of them.
[02:08:01.577 --> 02:08:04.498]  Is that why the government's now saying they may use a nuke on it?
[02:08:05.714 --> 02:08:14.341]  Well, we'll get to the nuke in a little bit, but I need to give some of the other details first, and then I'm going to tell you exactly what this man said to me is the only thing that can be done about it.
[02:08:14.962 --> 02:08:16.483]  Now, these safety devices...
[02:08:17.242 --> 02:08:20.704]  Uh, there's one of them down there called a fail-safe valve.
[02:08:20.865 --> 02:08:23.486]  Anybody in the oil business will recognize this immediately.
[02:08:24.027 --> 02:08:30.771]  The fail-safe valve is the one that's supposed to hold if everything else holds and all of the other safety devices below.
[02:08:31.231 --> 02:08:32.773]  This one is supposed to hold.
[02:08:32.833 --> 02:08:35.054]  This is what I'm about to give right now.
[02:08:35.574 --> 02:08:46.902]  Has never been told anywhere and you'll never hear it unless you happen to go to the BP informant that I had and they said to me, they said, Chaplain, there was a conversation between the worker
[02:08:47.503 --> 02:08:58.598]  And the foreman owned the rig not long before the blast took place, and the worker said to the foreman, the fail-safe valve is warped.
[02:08:58.618 --> 02:09:00.181]  There is a defective in it.
[02:09:00.501 --> 02:09:03.085]  We've got to replace it before we go any further.
[02:09:03.445 --> 02:09:07.888]  The foreman on the oil platform said to the worker, we don't have time.
[02:09:08.168 --> 02:09:09.289]  Let's continue going.
[02:09:09.649 --> 02:09:20.175]  It was just after that that the Gulf of Mexico oil well flowed, and it is flowing today approximately 4 million gallons a day, along with the fishers.
[02:09:20.535 --> 02:09:21.636]  Now they have been caught.
[02:09:21.676 --> 02:09:23.217]  First they said it was 5,000, then 20,000, then 100,000, then 500,000.
[02:09:23.277 --> 02:09:24.898]  You're saying it's millions of gallons from your BP source.
[02:09:24.918 --> 02:09:25.438]  That is correct.
[02:09:33.329 --> 02:09:36.475]  Now, will BP be able to stop the flow of the oil?
[02:09:36.755 --> 02:09:37.156]  You ready?
[02:09:37.717 --> 02:09:42.144]  Now this company... Oh wait, that makes sense though, the way they're keeping the media back, boy, I'm being suspicious.
[02:09:43.306 --> 02:09:46.050]  So you're saying this is a super mega disaster?
[02:09:46.843 --> 02:09:52.668]  This is a super mega disaster of something that the United States of America has never experienced and the world has never experienced.
[02:09:53.148 --> 02:09:58.913]  And the pressures on this well were so extreme compared to even what Russia hit years ago in that Cold War.
[02:09:58.933 --> 02:10:05.119]  Well, I've got to say it, you know, I mean, Lindsey Williams, it does seem like America, the whole world seems like it's cursed now.
[02:10:05.479 --> 02:10:07.441]  All the bad things that are happening constantly.
[02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:14.253]  Well, BP has tried everything, yeah, you're right, BP has tried everything in their power to stop this oil.
[02:10:14.614 --> 02:10:27.041]  They've done, they've used every scientific method that they can, but the truth of the matter is, this individual said to me, he said, but, he said there's only one thing that is gonna stop this.
[02:10:28.155 --> 02:10:29.757]  And he said, it's a nuclear device.
[02:10:30.157 --> 02:10:32.319]  But he immediately said, but.
[02:10:32.759 --> 02:10:33.860]  And I said, what do you mean?
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:45.890]  He said, if we angle drill and put in a nuclear device and blow what is presently there, he said, if we get success, we'll be the heroes of the world.
[02:10:46.411 --> 02:10:48.293]  He said, Chaplain, I am scared.
[02:10:48.473 --> 02:10:49.734]  And I could hear it in his voice.
[02:10:50.254 --> 02:11:17.880]  He said, if we explode that nuclear device, and this strata of oil, which nobody has ever drilled into one with this pressure before, he said, if we fail, and we rupture that strata further than what it already is, and plumes have been reported as much as 5 and 20 miles away, and I'll read them to you in just a moment or two, he said, if we rupture that strata further with that nuclear device, he said, Chaplain, I don't even want to think about it.
[02:11:18.973 --> 02:11:24.819]  Well, more and more evidence does point towards abiotic oil because the old oil wells are filling back up.
[02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:26.921]  It is being generated.
[02:11:26.941 --> 02:11:28.423]  It is coming from somewhere.
[02:11:29.444 --> 02:11:33.428]  And, of course, they do find coal that has ferns in it.
[02:11:33.908 --> 02:11:40.054]  It's clear that there is some oil that is produced from dead plankton and things that they find, natural gas.
[02:11:40.755 --> 02:11:51.140]  From the petroleum geologist I've talked to out in the ocean at shallower depths that they do believe did come from rotting plant and animal life, but that there is another type of oil.
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:52.801]  Look, it's a big debate.
[02:11:52.841 --> 02:11:58.144]  We'll continue with Lindsey Williams and I promise we're going to get to this fella that says he's a petroleum geologist on the other side.
[02:12:00.086 --> 02:12:02.689]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:08.074]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:12:08.434 --> 02:12:10.156]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:12:10.476 --> 02:12:14.480]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:16.420]  We're good.
[02:12:34.644 --> 02:12:38.145]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:12:38.466 --> 02:12:39.446]  How much will you need?
[02:12:39.686 --> 02:12:40.327]  We don't know.
[02:12:40.607 --> 02:12:41.507]  How much do you want?
[02:12:41.707 --> 02:12:42.428]  All you can get.
[02:12:42.628 --> 02:12:43.468]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:12:43.728 --> 02:12:46.490]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:12:46.770 --> 02:12:48.531]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:12:48.571 --> 02:12:49.471]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:13:00.057 --> 02:13:00.898]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:13:01.098 --> 02:13:06.423]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:13:06.624 --> 02:13:07.044]  I get it.
[02:13:07.164 --> 02:13:16.514]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:13:16.794 --> 02:13:17.955]  That's not what's happening.
[02:13:18.195 --> 02:13:26.440]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:29.942]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:13:30.042 --> 02:13:34.145]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:13:34.325 --> 02:13:35.886]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:13:35.926 --> 02:13:39.147]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:13:39.328 --> 02:13:43.430]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:13:43.690 --> 02:13:44.411]  You should, too.
[02:13:44.591 --> 02:13:45.552]  Find out what they know.
[02:13:45.733 --> 02:13:48.636]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:13:48.656 --> 02:13:48.696]  800-686-2237.
[02:13:48.716 --> 02:13:48.776]  800-686-2237.
[02:13:48.796 --> 02:13:49.157]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:13:59.742 --> 02:14:02.044]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:14:02.124 --> 02:14:04.325]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:14:04.425 --> 02:14:07.307]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:14:07.647 --> 02:14:12.410]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:16.953]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:14:17.253 --> 02:14:19.616]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:14:19.716 --> 02:14:22.138]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:14:22.498 --> 02:14:25.061]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:14:25.401 --> 02:14:32.989]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:38.625]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:14:38.725 --> 02:14:41.528]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:14:41.588 --> 02:14:45.011]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:14:45.272 --> 02:14:46.173]  And I got news for you.
[02:14:46.353 --> 02:14:47.654]  You're everyone else.
[02:14:47.694 --> 02:14:48.695]  Invisible Empire.

[02:14:59.147 --> 02:15:02.328]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:15:02.708 --> 02:15:04.529]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:15:04.989 --> 02:15:05.389]  Don't!
[02:15:05.849 --> 02:15:08.870]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:15:09.291 --> 02:15:16.413]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:15:16.393 --> 02:15:18.054]  's number one debt secret.
[02:15:18.374 --> 02:15:22.035]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:15:22.435 --> 02:15:25.177]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:15:25.577 --> 02:15:32.581]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:15:33.007 --> 02:15:33.907]  Herb K. was right.
[02:15:34.147 --> 02:15:37.189]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:15:37.369 --> 02:15:38.389]  What have you got to lose?
[02:15:38.769 --> 02:15:39.770]  Stop the calls now.
[02:15:40.050 --> 02:15:41.771]  Get out of debt and have more money.

[02:15:45.972 --> 02:15:46.493]  That's 800-822-1291.
[02:15:46.513 --> 02:15:46.553]  800-822-1291.
[02:16:02.452 --> 02:16:04.894]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:16:05.454 --> 02:16:08.716]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:16:08.996 --> 02:16:20.584]  Well look, I promised to take your calls in this hour, but I also want to hear from Lindsey Williams because he was telling me during the break, and I've never heard him this concerned, saying, listen Alex, I got a lot more to tell you.
[02:16:20.604 --> 02:16:22.605]  We haven't even gotten to the real meat and potatoes yet.
[02:16:22.665 --> 02:16:24.286]  Well, I thought that was the meat and potatoes.
[02:16:24.726 --> 02:16:29.890]  Again, I don't want to hear what he's about to say next, because they are acting freaked out about this, and that sucker is
[02:16:31.334 --> 02:16:32.915]  A lot bigger than what they first said.
[02:16:34.177 --> 02:16:35.898]  And they just can't cap it.
[02:16:35.938 --> 02:16:36.819]  They won't cap it.
[02:16:37.259 --> 02:16:41.523]  Then you've got the federal response, not letting the states respond to it.
[02:16:41.723 --> 02:16:45.246]  I'm really afraid Obama's going to get his carbon tax through this crisis.
[02:16:45.286 --> 02:16:48.489]  Like Rahm Emanuel said, don't let any crisis go to waste.
[02:16:49.089 --> 02:16:53.934]  But Terry in Ohio says they're a petroleum engineer for 12 years, worked with Halliburton.
[02:16:55.054 --> 02:16:58.555]  You know, I don't know why I haven't called Petroleum Engineers that I personally know.
[02:16:58.575 --> 02:17:04.356]  I mean, I guess early on I thought, okay, petroleum spill, yeah, big deal, media distraction.
[02:17:04.696 --> 02:17:07.417]  But it is getting crazier and crazier.
[02:17:07.697 --> 02:17:09.097]  So we're going to go back to Lindsey Williams.
[02:17:09.137 --> 02:17:10.437]  He's sitting here with us.
[02:17:10.977 --> 02:17:12.558]  But going to Terry.
[02:17:12.858 --> 02:17:14.378]  Terry, what's your take on all this?
[02:17:15.378 --> 02:17:19.379]  Well, Alex, you know, I've been talking about this ever since I heard it happen.
[02:17:19.499 --> 02:17:22.520]  And I've told people right from the very beginning.
[02:17:24.244 --> 02:17:40.190]  First of all, I even told my wife, the only way you're going to be able to stop anything, since you got all the wreckage and pipe and everything else down on top of the, on the well site, it'll be scattered all over the place down there because it's floated to the bottom.
[02:17:40.810 --> 02:17:47.953]  But you had things that was connected to it also that's going to kind of like bring it down and move some pieces depending on how it fell down on the bottom.
[02:17:48.573 --> 02:17:49.874]  But I even said then that
[02:17:51.317 --> 02:17:59.586]  The only option that you would have would be to set off a small nuclear bomb.
[02:17:59.646 --> 02:18:07.895]  But, you know, the thing about it is, you know, to like seal the well, to well, you know, to create a, like, you know, cauterize it.
[02:18:08.295 --> 02:18:09.877]  But see, you, first of all,
[02:18:10.697 --> 02:18:17.799]  You know, I told, like I was telling others, you know, you got to look at, you're at 5,000 feet deep in water.
[02:18:18.140 --> 02:18:26.942]  Well, you know, you're, you're almost at, uh, temperature level down there is, uh, almost, you know, close to sub zero.
[02:18:26.962 --> 02:18:27.523]  You know what I mean?
[02:18:27.603 --> 02:18:29.143]  It's really cold down there.
[02:18:29.903 --> 02:18:31.204]  And then you've got to figure the,
[02:18:31.912 --> 02:18:32.452]  We're good to go.
[02:18:53.553 --> 02:19:00.897]  So trying to determine what size nuke to use to cauterize this thing is almost impossible to figure, Ben.
[02:19:00.937 --> 02:19:02.358]  Here's something else you've got to look at.
[02:19:02.398 --> 02:19:05.119]  Let me ask you this question, though, and then we'll get Lindsey's take on it.
[02:19:05.659 --> 02:19:11.563]  If you've got all these fissures, they've now confirmed, at least two, they believe three or more.
[02:19:12.443 --> 02:19:15.605]  Three, four, five, six miles away, pluming up.
[02:19:15.945 --> 02:19:25.669]  Is the high pressure now blowing out the casing and eroding into other channels in the rock and the seabed and coming up?
[02:19:25.689 --> 02:19:31.772]  And will this blast a bigger and bigger opening and potentially get worse?
[02:19:32.453 --> 02:19:41.157]  Well, I figure what actually really started the fissures, I mean, they already began when you had the blowout because you had
[02:19:41.724 --> 02:19:51.634]  The different safety measures in place, even though, you know, your blowout preventers and different things like that, they're going to hold back pressure on that.
[02:19:51.674 --> 02:20:04.106]  So when that began to blow out, that almost, it almost practically fracked itself as far as opening up, you know, directional fractures, because it's always going to go to the point of least resistance, okay?
[02:20:05.134 --> 02:20:11.199]  I agree with it because when you're going that deep into the earth's mantle
[02:20:27.781 --> 02:20:45.813]  It would be very easy to come in contact with an oil source, an oil and gas source, but at the same time the extreme pressures are coming from, you know, you've got your molten lava and all that stuff pushing up from the center of the earth, so you've got all those inner earth pressures.
[02:20:45.833 --> 02:20:55.579]  Well that's another thing, they could have gone into a, they could have gone into a bathylift, for those that don't know, that's a magma bubble up into the higher levels of the crust.
[02:20:56.536 --> 02:20:59.537]  Yeah, and you know that that's true, too, Alex, because I'll tell you why.
[02:20:59.557 --> 02:21:02.658]  It's just like I was explaining to my wife and others.
[02:21:02.938 --> 02:21:10.280]  You know how they're finding these, like, tar patties and things like that on the sands in Pensacola, Florida, and those places?
[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:10.720]  Yeah.
[02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:11.480]  Okay.
[02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:13.641]  What causes that is, is this.
[02:21:14.161 --> 02:21:24.444]  Not only do you have extreme pressure, but that oil and gas mixture is heated, and it is so hot, okay?
[02:21:25.242 --> 02:21:32.604]  That it's coming up out of the ground under extreme pressure, and then when it hits that cold water, it begins to cool.
[02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:35.745]  It's just like a lava flow as soon as it hits the ocean.
[02:21:36.186 --> 02:21:36.646]  Exactly.
[02:21:36.926 --> 02:21:41.727]  Now, and then all the brown stuff coming up, is that sand, dirt being propelled out?
[02:21:41.968 --> 02:21:43.348]  We're gonna come back with Lindsey Williams.
[02:21:43.368 --> 02:21:44.969]  This gets worse by the minute, folks.
[02:21:45.409 --> 02:21:45.929]  I tell ya.
[02:21:46.949 --> 02:21:48.550]  I'm late getting to the party on this one.
[02:21:49.310 --> 02:21:50.230]  We're on the march.
[02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:52.191]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:53.209 --> 02:21:55.970]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.490 --> 02:22:01.951]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:22:02.731 --> 02:22:03.651]  Tyranny is here.
[02:22:03.991 --> 02:22:07.552]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:22:07.852 --> 02:22:10.132]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:10.152 --> 02:22:15.614]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:16.014 --> 02:22:22.255]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:22.675 --> 02:22:28.238]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:28.618 --> 02:22:32.360]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:36.802]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:22:37.122 --> 02:22:42.645]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:43.085 --> 02:22:46.026]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:46.627 --> 02:22:48.067]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:48.608 --> 02:22:49.048]  It's here.

[02:24:58.133 --> 02:24:58.573]  Extract.
[02:25:00.274 --> 02:25:09.597]  They rail against the crowd.
[02:25:11.098 --> 02:25:12.938]  Another ragtag band.
[02:25:14.099 --> 02:25:17.620]  Declaring independence.
[02:25:22.083 --> 02:25:27.006]  We're simulcasting on the radio right now, but we're also at PrisonPlanet.tv streaming live.
[02:25:27.667 --> 02:25:37.594]  A batholith is, you know, normally the crust of the Earth is 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 feet thick, depending on which area of the Earth.
[02:25:38.054 --> 02:25:47.902]  A volcano, obviously, an active volcano, is where the crust gets hulled out by a batholith, or a magma chamber, and makes it to the surface.
[02:25:49.375 --> 02:25:54.997]  And if you go to Enchanted Rock outside Austin, Texas, it's a big mountain of pink and gray granite.
[02:25:55.037 --> 02:25:55.557]  Very beautiful.
[02:25:55.577 --> 02:26:02.580]  It looks like a big, you know, half soccer ball sticking up out of the ground, basically.
[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:08.082]  And it's a batholith, because it pushes the crust up, or a mountain up above it.
[02:26:08.482 --> 02:26:16.685]  Over time, that erodes away, and you've got a perfectly, you know, round dome of frozen lava.
[02:26:18.069 --> 02:26:18.990]  Cooled magma.
[02:26:39.292 --> 02:26:40.572]  And then it kills a bunch of people.
[02:26:41.413 --> 02:26:43.553]  Here, though, you do this in the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:26:44.794 --> 02:26:47.675]  Well, going back to Lindsey Williams, we're going to go 30 minutes into the next hour.
[02:26:47.695 --> 02:26:49.055]  I'm going to overdrive again today.
[02:26:49.075 --> 02:26:49.975]  I'm getting addicted to this.
[02:26:50.015 --> 02:26:54.737]  I did an hour and 15 minutes of extra broadcast yesterday, but we'll just do 30 minutes next hour.
[02:26:55.257 --> 02:27:07.061]  And I really appreciate Lindsey Williams coming on us, because he's got BP sources, and he has this former, well, I know the former CEO, and so does Lindsey Williams' other colleague, Dr. Stan Monteith, because I believe
[02:27:08.221 --> 02:27:20.370]  Lindsey Williams, when he tells us all this, he's a good pastor, wrote a book 25 years ago that's now been admitted to be accurate, given us other predictions that come true, but Dr. Stan Monteith knew who this guy was, like I did, and actually called him.
[02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:21.751]  But I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:27:21.791 --> 02:27:24.293]  So this is real intel, but take it for what it's worth.
[02:27:24.313 --> 02:27:29.196]  The globalist, the Bilderberg type guy, former, you know, head of one of the big three oil companies.
[02:27:29.617 --> 02:27:30.938]  This is his view on it.
[02:27:31.178 --> 02:27:32.359]  We're getting it from Lindsey Williams.
[02:27:32.619 --> 02:27:36.642]  Lindsey, that petroleum geologist that called in backed up what you had to say.
[02:27:37.523 --> 02:27:43.573]  Please continue, but this looks like they drilled into some type of magma chamber or batholith.
[02:27:44.855 --> 02:27:48.481]  Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat from Florida.
[02:27:49.665 --> 02:27:53.886]  He appeared yesterday, June the 9th, on MSNBC.
[02:27:54.566 --> 02:27:56.267]  Andrea Mitchell interviewed him.
[02:27:56.387 --> 02:27:57.667]  You can go and look at this.
[02:27:57.807 --> 02:27:58.347]  Please do.
[02:27:58.928 --> 02:28:02.188]  He said, oil is seeping up from the seabed.
[02:28:02.889 --> 02:28:11.651]  Now let me give you the report that was given on Tuesday of this week by NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[02:28:12.231 --> 02:28:13.833]  This is Chris Baltimore.
[02:28:13.873 --> 02:28:18.677]  You'll notice that I am very carefully documenting everything I am saying today, Alex.
[02:28:19.217 --> 02:28:20.498]  This man is from Houston.
[02:28:20.999 --> 02:28:22.260]  Disappeared on routers.
[02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:24.081]  Go and find it for yourself.
[02:28:24.702 --> 02:28:25.923]  It says, U.S.
[02:28:26.283 --> 02:28:39.595]  experts investigating reports of undersea oil plumes emanating from BP's PICS stricken well in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday confirmed the presence of low levels of oil below the surface.
[02:28:40.155 --> 02:28:52.098]  NOAA is confirming the presence of very low concentrations of subsurface oil and they have admitted now to underseas plumes.
[02:28:52.138 --> 02:28:53.778]  Now let me try to explain very quickly.
[02:28:54.359 --> 02:28:55.299]  Underseas plumes.
[02:28:55.719 --> 02:29:00.740]  What the gentleman said just a moment ago that you took the phone call from, Alex, he's exactly right.
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:03.861]  And when I heard him say it, and you'll get to it in a minute,
[02:29:04.461 --> 02:29:05.061]  Undoubtedly.
[02:29:05.441 --> 02:29:21.945]  Whenever this extreme pressure of 20,000 to 70,000 pounds per square inch hit that pipe, it probably bursted at numerous points between the floor where they had gone into this strata of oil and the top of the pipe.
[02:29:22.406 --> 02:29:26.687]  And now that oil is leaking out as far as 20 miles away.
[02:29:28.638 --> 02:29:36.950]  Now not just five, NOAA said that they had roughly been able to confirm 20 mile away plumes.
[02:29:37.351 --> 02:29:40.916]  This means that this thing is fractured in many spots.
[02:29:41.036 --> 02:29:44.521]  And let me just add, let me just add that a baffle lift is
[02:29:45.442 --> 02:29:52.985]  A underground magma chamber that has cooled a lacolith is one that is still molten.
[02:29:53.746 --> 02:29:58.948]  And that was their concern with super deep drilling is that they would hit these underground magma chambers.
[02:29:58.988 --> 02:30:07.072]  And a lot of laymen looking at it coming out under pressure, record pressure, said it looks like a volcano.
[02:30:07.452 --> 02:30:09.673]  Well, what does your inside source say?
[02:30:09.993 --> 02:30:11.674]  Because that's where this looks like this is leading.
[02:30:12.594 --> 02:30:14.275]  Yes, that's exactly correct.
[02:30:14.335 --> 02:30:16.675]  Now, let me go to something much more startling.
[02:30:17.316 --> 02:30:23.658]  The black oil in the water in the Gulf of Mexico is not the greatest danger.
[02:30:23.818 --> 02:30:24.698]  Are you hearing me?
[02:30:24.718 --> 02:30:32.241]  I mean, you've got to understand we are not being told by our president and by our congressman, and they know this.
[02:30:32.801 --> 02:30:41.944]  The black stuff that comes out that you call oil is just destroying wildlife, fish and oysters and shrimp and fishermen's occupations and pristine white beaches.
[02:30:42.584 --> 02:30:42.864]  I think?
[02:31:00.214 --> 02:31:03.055]  Of humans and unborn babies.
[02:31:03.155 --> 02:31:04.076]  Popes, please!
[02:31:04.636 --> 02:31:06.657]  I have never been so concerned in my life.
[02:31:07.137 --> 02:31:09.098]  Most people think only oil comes out.
[02:31:09.658 --> 02:31:11.419]  Oil is not the only thing that comes out.
[02:31:11.479 --> 02:31:12.320]  I'm going to give them to you.
[02:31:12.720 --> 02:31:13.981]  Right from the EPA.
[02:31:14.241 --> 02:31:16.102]  They came out with their report this week.
[02:31:16.402 --> 02:31:18.623]  This is the Environmental Protection Agency.
[02:31:18.963 --> 02:31:19.923]  They went to the Gulf.
[02:31:20.223 --> 02:31:21.364]  They made their test.
[02:31:21.844 --> 02:31:25.286]  And they found coming out with the oil are some of the most
[02:31:25.846 --> 02:31:27.107]  We're good to go.
[02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:50.322]  Volatile organic compounds in the air in the Gulf.
[02:31:50.362 --> 02:31:51.283]  Did you get those words?
[02:31:51.303 --> 02:31:52.243]  This is very important.
[02:31:52.643 --> 02:31:54.664]  Volatile organic compounds.
[02:31:55.184 --> 02:31:56.084]  They listed some.
[02:31:56.185 --> 02:31:57.245]  I'm gonna list them for you.
[02:31:57.485 --> 02:31:59.326]  This will scare the daylights out of you.
[02:31:59.846 --> 02:32:04.048]  In the atmosphere, in the Gulf, number one, hydrogen sulfide.
[02:32:04.868 --> 02:32:09.530]  The levels that are allowed, according to the EPA's own statements,
[02:32:10.211 --> 02:32:17.273]  The allowable levels of hydrogen sulfide are 5 to 10 parts per billion.
[02:32:17.313 --> 02:32:19.233]  I'm saying these very carefully so you get it.
[02:32:19.373 --> 02:32:21.214]  P-T-D.
[02:32:21.574 --> 02:32:23.054]  Parts per billion.
[02:32:23.474 --> 02:32:30.336]  They tested in the last few days in the Gulf, and the winds are carrying this to the shore.
[02:32:30.576 --> 02:32:32.076]  This scares the daylights out of me.
[02:32:32.396 --> 02:32:33.957]  Florida's getting it.
[02:32:34.097 --> 02:32:34.637]  Alabama.
[02:32:35.457 --> 02:32:35.917]  Georgia.
[02:32:36.537 --> 02:32:37.197]  Mississippi.
[02:32:37.557 --> 02:32:38.238]  Louisiana.
[02:32:38.578 --> 02:32:39.578]  Hydrogen sulfide.
[02:32:40.302 --> 02:32:42.844]  Safe levels, 5 to 10 parts per billion.
[02:32:43.205 --> 02:32:50.351]  Tested level this past week presently, 1,200 parts per billion.
[02:32:50.671 --> 02:32:52.092]  And you wonder why people are getting sick.
[02:32:52.112 --> 02:32:53.433]  Let me give you the next one.
[02:32:53.954 --> 02:32:54.614]  Benzene.
[02:32:54.795 --> 02:32:55.435]  Oh, please.
[02:32:55.755 --> 02:33:01.160]  I'm going to read you the contents and how dangerous benzene is at the moment.
[02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:02.181]  Benzene.
[02:33:02.972 --> 02:33:03.912]  This is toxic.
[02:33:04.412 --> 02:33:05.813]  It causes malignancies.
[02:33:06.333 --> 02:33:08.774]  It's known to cause leukemia and cancer.
[02:33:09.334 --> 02:33:21.398]  The safe level, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's own records, it is so toxic they only allow zero to four pots per billion.
[02:33:22.136 --> 02:33:34.986]  The current level in the Gulf of Mexico going to the shore of all of those states and Florida being carried by the winds is 3,000 parts per billion.
[02:33:35.026 --> 02:33:37.668]  Folks, this is so startling.
[02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:39.910]  The people down there should at least
[02:33:40.586 --> 02:33:42.287]  We're going to have
[02:33:55.307 --> 02:33:59.250]  Performed babies and people with respiratory problems and people dying.
[02:33:59.290 --> 02:34:00.170]  I will give you one more.
[02:34:00.310 --> 02:34:01.671]  Well, I must go back to benzene.
[02:34:01.691 --> 02:34:02.092]  Wait a minute.
[02:34:02.472 --> 02:34:05.654]  I got to read you what the... what it says on benzene.
[02:34:05.754 --> 02:34:15.901]  Exposed... exposure to low levels of benzene can cause dizziness, drowsiness, headache, confusion, tremor, rapid heartbeat, and unconsciousness.
[02:34:16.261 --> 02:34:22.966]  Long-term exposure to benzene can cause damage in the bone marrow and lead to blood problems like leukemia.
[02:34:23.994 --> 02:34:31.041]  It also weakens the immune system and targets organs such as the kidneys, lungs, and the brain.
[02:34:31.322 --> 02:34:37.288]  Folks, this is so dangerous until even I, as a minister, shudder to think about it.
[02:34:37.528 --> 02:34:38.549]  I'm going to give you one more.
[02:34:38.929 --> 02:34:41.512]  It was in the EPA's report.
[02:34:42.026 --> 02:34:43.746]  Methylene Chloride.
[02:34:44.307 --> 02:34:50.388]  Safe levels of Methylene Chloride that a person can breathe in the air, and this is airborne, in the Gulf.
[02:34:50.868 --> 02:34:52.549]  Safe levels.
[02:34:52.909 --> 02:34:54.409]  61 parts per billion.
[02:34:54.949 --> 02:35:04.511]  The current levels that were just found a few days ago by the EPA, 3,000 to 3,400 parts per billion.
[02:35:05.172 --> 02:35:10.633]  And the American people are not being warned that they're breathing this toxic, flammable stuff
[02:35:11.173 --> 02:35:13.234]  And, Alex, a hurricane.
[02:35:13.755 --> 02:35:14.895]  I shudder to think about it.
[02:35:15.396 --> 02:35:24.741]  A hurricane could carry this stuff all the way up the East Coast of America, and no healthcare system in the world would ever be able to pay the hospital bills of what people are going to suffer.
[02:35:24.761 --> 02:35:25.682]  Alex, I'm sure you know.
[02:35:25.702 --> 02:35:30.045]  Well, the good news is, the good news is, there's tens of trillions of gallons
[02:35:31.144 --> 02:35:31.944]  I don't know the number.
[02:35:32.004 --> 02:35:38.826]  Guys, do a search engine on estimated gallons of water in the Gulf of Mexico slash Caribbean.
[02:35:39.506 --> 02:35:51.889]  I mean, the good news is, though, even though you're saying your sources have this at 4 or 5 million gallons a day, not 500 million, even though all that's going on, that a lot of this is going to be dispersed and diluted.
[02:35:52.549 --> 02:36:02.198]  I mean, I'm not saying it isn't, but I mean, certainly the people are getting sick who are cleaning this up, and I had thought, I mean, I know there is some of these toxins in oil, depending on where you drill.
[02:36:02.579 --> 02:36:03.139]  It varies.
[02:36:04.463 --> 02:36:08.585]  As you know, Lindsey, working for oil companies, you have the sweet crude that's very clean.
[02:36:09.185 --> 02:36:11.326]  You have the regular crude that has a lot of other things in it.
[02:36:11.766 --> 02:36:16.068]  And a lot of the toxic waste that we deal with in the oil industry is the byproducts and what to do with it all.
[02:36:17.009 --> 02:36:20.390]  But any way you slice it, it's a catastrophe.
[02:36:20.410 --> 02:36:24.932]  But I mean, going back, you talked about nukes.
[02:36:25.512 --> 02:36:26.793]  And I remember this two weeks ago.
[02:36:26.813 --> 02:36:27.693]  Now they're on Fox.
[02:36:27.733 --> 02:36:31.395]  Now they have the government saying, we may have to nuke, we may have to drill in and do this.
[02:36:31.855 --> 02:36:33.556]  What did your sources say about nukes?
[02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:36.371]  My source was scared to death.
[02:36:36.791 --> 02:36:43.216]  He said to me, he said, Chaplain, the only way that I can see to stop this is a nuclear device.
[02:36:43.977 --> 02:36:45.217]  And he said, but.
[02:36:46.078 --> 02:36:48.840]  And I could hear the fear in his voice.
[02:36:49.621 --> 02:36:50.581]  He said, a nuke.
[02:36:51.202 --> 02:36:57.426]  Because of the strata that BP has drilled into, which nobody probably has ever drilled into before.
[02:36:57.826 --> 02:37:02.750]  And he said, because of the extreme pressure that's already there and what has happened to that pipe.
[02:37:03.522 --> 02:37:11.027]  He said to put a nuke in there would take months in the first place because he said we've got to angle drill in order to get down to it to be able to do it.
[02:37:11.347 --> 02:37:16.450]  He said Chaplain, the thing that frightens me so much is that if we use a nuke
[02:37:17.481 --> 02:37:18.862]  That we might succeed.
[02:37:19.202 --> 02:37:20.843]  And he said, hopefully we can.
[02:37:21.283 --> 02:37:27.746]  But he said, if we don't, he said, we crack that strata further and it will never be stopped.
[02:37:28.046 --> 02:37:30.848]  And it will flow like this and even more forever.
[02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:32.749]  And he said, that frightens me.
[02:37:32.809 --> 02:37:33.990]  All right, let me bring this up.
[02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:35.590]  And I looked it up.
[02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:40.433]  Vanadium is a chemical element with the symbol V at atomic number 23.
[02:37:40.493 --> 02:37:45.656]  It is a soft silver gray ductile transition metal.
[02:37:46.576 --> 02:37:50.218]  The formation of the oxide layer stabilizes the metal against oxidation.
[02:37:50.238 --> 02:37:52.920]  And it says it was discovered in 1801.
[02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:59.703]  And the report I've got here is, and this is an email, we have to look into this, this is unconfirmed.
[02:38:02.369 --> 02:38:03.730]  Taking Gulf Coast calls.
[02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:20.764]  Two nights ago, my friend, who works for a consultant with a toxicologist that works for the EPA, showed my friend and I a private memo from a top EPA official asking all consultants and researchers to pull up as much scientific information on vanadium.
[02:38:21.125 --> 02:38:24.327]  Apparently, they are reporting extremely high levels of vanadium.
[02:38:25.168 --> 02:38:26.429]  Because they're drilling so deep, folks.
[02:38:26.889 --> 02:38:34.272]  And upper management is getting upset because they do not have any valid research information on exposure of vanadium in the Gulf.
[02:38:34.312 --> 02:38:40.996]  Previously, there's been a small study done in 2006 that measures small amounts of vanadium being released.
[02:38:41.016 --> 02:38:42.196]  Vanadium is highly toxic.
[02:38:42.256 --> 02:38:43.057]  Please report on this.
[02:38:43.357 --> 02:38:46.778]  You might get EPA consultant to call in.
[02:38:46.818 --> 02:38:49.540]  My friend will not give me the document.
[02:38:50.661 --> 02:38:52.782]  Guys, do a search, because I bet some of this is leaked.
[02:38:53.383 --> 02:38:55.065]  Vanadium being released in the Gulf.
[02:38:55.785 --> 02:38:57.747]  Lindsey Williams, did you hear anything about Vanadium?
[02:38:58.728 --> 02:38:58.908]  No.
[02:38:59.168 --> 02:39:15.523]  Vanadium was not mentioned in any of my conversations, but Alex, the way that this thing is progressing so rapidly from day to day, I will probably be making updates weekly on this as I contact my sources in what's happening, and I will be glad to ask them about Vanadium.
[02:39:15.734 --> 02:39:20.538]  And I'm glad to hear you're also putting together an emergency DVD report that we'll talk about in the next segment.
[02:39:20.838 --> 02:39:35.771]  I want to jam in a few more calls, but you'll be with us for 30 minutes into the next hour, and we'll do that same procedure from yesterday, but this time we'll take your calls, where I give out the number here at my office for those that are patiently holding, so you can be with us in the overdrive.
[02:39:35.791 --> 02:39:42.376]  The only way to listen there will be InfoWars.com on the audio streams and PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:39:43.077 --> 02:39:44.157]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[02:39:45.845 --> 02:39:47.105]  We've got a bunch of calls here.
[02:39:51.967 --> 02:39:56.989]  In fact, we've got an anonymous caller here who says he was a contractor for BP during this thing.
[02:39:57.249 --> 02:39:59.069]  He says he's seen all kinds of insanity.
[02:39:59.589 --> 02:40:00.530]  Which caller is that?
[02:40:00.570 --> 02:40:02.931]  Which caller is anonymous in LA?
[02:40:03.191 --> 02:40:04.131]  Or is this Louisiana?
[02:40:05.511 --> 02:40:07.032]  Genesis, which caller is that?
[02:40:10.817 --> 02:40:12.077]  I just call them number two.
[02:40:12.698 --> 02:40:13.298]  Okay, sure.
[02:40:13.758 --> 02:40:15.778]  Anonymous... That's fine.
[02:40:15.818 --> 02:40:16.799]  We can just make one up.
[02:40:17.079 --> 02:40:19.879]  I mean, I've got to know what line they're on to be able to say go to them.
[02:40:20.119 --> 02:40:21.740]  Yeah, yeah, let's go to that anonymous caller.
[02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:23.960]  Anonymous caller, you're on the air.
[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:26.461]  Is it Los Angeles or Louisiana you're calling in from?
[02:40:26.481 --> 02:40:28.602]  I was in Louisiana.
[02:40:29.022 --> 02:40:29.882]  Okay, what did you see?
[02:40:29.902 --> 02:40:37.624]  Okay, the information may not be as good as what you just had there, but I can just tell you some of the things that I saw.
[02:40:39.573 --> 02:40:49.096]  I know that they have the timeline for the explosion, and I know that the first name that was up on there was work being done by Halliburton.
[02:40:49.156 --> 02:40:59.739]  Within 20 hours after they were injecting minerals into the well, they almost immediately started having gas problems, and it was within 20 hours later that the explosion occurred.
[02:41:00.699 --> 02:41:03.620]  And as it was explained to me by people who do this for a living,
[02:41:04.347 --> 02:41:13.110]  Uh, they said that, uh, they have standard procedures for venting and handling of all of this, and it was the first time ever in history that all three safety measures failed.
[02:41:14.471 --> 02:41:21.554]  Uh, and that was, uh, although I don't, I'm not the one who does this for a living, that was what was explained to me by the people who do do it for a living.
[02:41:21.814 --> 02:41:24.555]  So you're a separate contractor that was working in and around this?
[02:41:25.135 --> 02:41:25.275]  Yes.
[02:41:27.462 --> 02:41:29.803]  But that sounds like that meshes with what Lindsey is saying.
[02:41:29.823 --> 02:41:35.166]  We had a petroleum geologist earlier on who said, yes, it looks like mega record pressure.
[02:41:35.526 --> 02:41:39.809]  I mean, what's a normal high pressure well, Lindsey Williams?
[02:41:40.769 --> 02:41:47.753]  Prudhoe Bay oil came up at 1,500 pounds per square inch, and they considered that to be a pretty good oil pressure.
[02:41:47.874 --> 02:41:55.198]  To get 20,000 to 70,000 pounds per square inch would blow anything that any oil company or any human
[02:41:56.658 --> 02:42:08.142]  Okay, and my involvement on that end of things was more towards the cleanup end of things.
[02:42:08.942 --> 02:42:17.864]  And just to give a couple of examples of some of the things I saw, I know they were ready to deploy about 25,000 linear feet of boom.
[02:42:18.404 --> 02:42:21.585]  The National Guard came and said, no, we have to count it.
[02:42:22.206 --> 02:42:23.626]  And they moved it from boat to boat.
[02:42:24.538 --> 02:42:48.572]  and uh... five days in which that uh... boom could have been deployed they later they came back and after five days that boom could have been completely deployed instead they sat and counted it and then they brought it back after moving it from boat to boat yeah it's like weird it's like New Orleans they said we got all this food and water stacked up you can't have it and you can't walk out over the highway we're gonna machine gun you we're government we're God what else did you see?
[02:42:50.383 --> 02:42:57.168]  Well, I do know that another explanation I had was the oil could have been hit.
[02:42:57.728 --> 02:42:58.128]  Stay there!
[02:42:58.169 --> 02:42:58.589]  Stay there!
[02:42:59.670 --> 02:43:01.031]  Don't answer it!

[02:43:17.483 --> 02:43:21.525]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[02:44:02.911 --> 02:44:03.852]  Tyranny is here.
[02:44:04.172 --> 02:44:08.094]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:44:08.114 --> 02:44:10.335]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:44:10.355 --> 02:44:15.797]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:44:16.217 --> 02:44:22.420]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:44:22.876 --> 02:44:28.419]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:32.502]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:44:33.022 --> 02:44:37.044]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:44:37.325 --> 02:44:42.868]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:44:43.268 --> 02:44:46.150]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:48.211]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:44:48.772 --> 02:44:49.232]  It's here.

[02:44:58.143 --> 02:45:01.064]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:45:01.144 --> 02:45:03.085]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:45:03.205 --> 02:45:05.867]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:45:05.967 --> 02:45:07.908]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:45:08.188 --> 02:45:09.368]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:45:09.588 --> 02:45:11.209]  But first, the facts.
[02:45:11.489 --> 02:45:13.210]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:45:13.430 --> 02:45:15.131]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:45:15.411 --> 02:45:18.913]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:45:19.093 --> 02:45:26.496]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:45:26.857 --> 02:45:27.457]  Sinofresh.

[02:45:48.408 --> 02:45:48.688]  It works!
[02:46:02.861 --> 02:46:13.705]  You know, we're talking about really heavy subjects here and we're going into overdrive in the next hour for...
[02:46:20.543 --> 02:46:25.106]  Gary, John, Matt, Mike, everybody else, but first those callers.
[02:46:25.386 --> 02:46:27.828]  We're gonna go to your calls this time with Lindsey Williams next hour.
[02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:33.732]  Yesterday I said we're going into overdrive, I never got to the callers, but today we will.
[02:46:33.752 --> 02:46:35.494]  888-201-2244.
[02:46:35.514 --> 02:46:42.018]  888-201-2244 is the number in my studio in Austin that we give out when we go into overdrive and on the Sunday show.
[02:46:42.038 --> 02:46:42.278]  888-201-2244.
[02:46:42.298 --> 02:46:43.139]  On a separate issue,
[02:46:46.221 --> 02:47:08.755]  Before we go back to Lindsey Williams, yeah, this is how we fund our operation, and if we can't have a website, if we can't have a shopping cart, if we can't have a Yahoo shopping cart and another shopping cart we just launched, and our eBay store, we might sell four or five things on a day trying to fund this operation, then we can't continue, or we'll have to go to straight-up donations.
[02:47:09.935 --> 02:47:12.576]  You know, right as we're reaching all these millions of people.
[02:47:13.236 --> 02:47:14.736]  And we're hitting censorship everywhere.
[02:47:15.196 --> 02:47:17.517]  I've been selling this t-shirt for eight years.
[02:47:17.537 --> 02:47:19.917]  It's one of the first t-shirts we offered.
[02:47:20.877 --> 02:47:22.918]  No, actually, this is the first t-shirt we offered.
[02:47:22.938 --> 02:47:24.878]  And it's still a bestseller.
[02:47:25.018 --> 02:47:26.158]  Mass murderers agree.
[02:47:26.458 --> 02:47:27.318]  Gun Control Works.
[02:47:27.418 --> 02:47:28.519]  Infowars.com.
[02:47:29.719 --> 02:47:33.540]  And on the back it says, Politicians love disarmed peasants.
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:35.200]  Infowars.com.
[02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:43.312]  Now, we were selling this on eBay, I think for $10, same thing it is on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[02:47:45.872 --> 02:47:49.213]  Basically make about $5, and we're so evil trying to fund ourselves here.
[02:47:51.114 --> 02:47:59.116]  And eBay sent us a letter saying, you have been removed for hateful or discriminatory activity, and one more time and your eBay account is banned.
[02:48:00.096 --> 02:48:02.477]  For saying, Hitler is bad!
[02:48:03.649 --> 02:48:07.752]  This is like France, where you can't sell World War II memorabilia now.
[02:48:07.832 --> 02:48:12.235]  First it was Nazi, now it's British, now it's American, because any of it might be Nazi-related.
[02:48:13.456 --> 02:48:14.977]  We're saying Hitler's bad!
[02:48:15.958 --> 02:48:22.903]  Mass murderers agree, gun control works, with a picture of Mao, Stalin, and Hitler.
[02:48:23.644 --> 02:48:30.529]  Now, since I have mainstream news today that at veteran cemeteries they're putting up, you know, Mao, I mean, excuse me, Stalin statues,
[02:48:32.051 --> 02:48:33.854]  Maybe that's what this is really all about.
[02:48:34.395 --> 02:48:36.137]  Maybe I'm not in trouble because they don't tell us.
[02:48:36.438 --> 02:48:47.073]  For the Hitler saying he's bad, maybe it's... See, maybe we're not in trouble just because it's Hitler and they can't read and see that we're criticizing Hitler.
[02:48:48.101 --> 02:48:53.084]  Maybe it's that we're criticizing Mao or Stalin because they're so popular now in the U.S.
[02:48:53.124 --> 02:48:59.288]  and have toy stores in it for Mao and restaurants and Stalin's a great guy and college kids wear shirts of him.
[02:48:59.308 --> 02:49:00.909]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[02:49:01.589 --> 02:49:04.832]  Now the issue is, that's why I'm for Nazis having their free speech.
[02:49:05.112 --> 02:49:11.256]  Because you take the Nazis' free speech, or you take the Mexican supremacist free speech, or the black supremacist free speech,
[02:49:12.196 --> 02:49:14.618]  Then you're going to lose your free speech, and that's how this works!
[02:49:15.219 --> 02:49:17.681]  I now cannot criticize Hitler!
[02:49:17.701 --> 02:49:27.590]  We're going to do an article about this at Infowars.com today, a little blurb with a copy of the eBay letter about... We do this one more time.
[02:49:29.071 --> 02:49:32.454]  Images depicting high-ranking Nazi officers are not permitted to be sold on the site.
[02:49:32.935 --> 02:49:33.956]  Please do not relist them.
[02:49:36.778 --> 02:49:37.939]  And it goes on...
[02:49:40.219 --> 02:49:41.260]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:49:41.741 --> 02:49:43.062]  So, there's your tyranny.
[02:49:43.883 --> 02:49:45.565]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:45.605 --> 02:49:57.016]  Now, we're going to plug it more in overdrive because I've got to prompt you to do it, but I want people to get the new special DVD report you made last week that just came out about this new intel.
[02:49:57.216 --> 02:50:03.303]  Give folks quickly, Lindsey, the number for people to get the new DVD that breaks down this intel you've got on the oil spill.
[02:50:04.079 --> 02:50:05.301]  I produced it on yesterday.
[02:50:05.722 --> 02:50:06.563]  Please call 888-799.
[02:50:12.226 --> 02:50:17.589]  6111 or go on the web to prophecyclub.com.
[02:50:17.669 --> 02:50:22.813]  P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B dot com.
[02:50:22.853 --> 02:50:27.196]  Yeah, prophecyclub.com.
[02:50:27.216 --> 02:50:28.336]  888-799-6111.
[02:50:29.597 --> 02:50:32.419]  Okay, Lindsey, we've got to go to break for one minute.
[02:50:32.439 --> 02:50:37.182]  We're back in commercial free overdrive on the internet streams, infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:50:37.202 --> 02:50:38.323]  You've got to go there.
[02:50:40.498 --> 02:50:44.159]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:50:44.179 --> 02:50:46.360]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:50:49.261 --> 02:50:51.861]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:50:52.282 --> 02:50:57.243]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:50:57.603 --> 02:50:59.324]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:50:59.644 --> 02:51:04.465]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:51:04.645 --> 02:51:05.606]  How much do you want?
[02:51:05.826 --> 02:51:06.566]  When do you want it?
[02:51:06.946 --> 02:51:08.546]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:51:08.826 --> 02:51:09.647]  When will you need it?
[02:51:09.907 --> 02:51:11.967]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:51:12.107 --> 02:51:13.208]  Will there be any food?
[02:51:13.448 --> 02:51:14.768]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:51:14.968 --> 02:51:20.029]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:51:20.249 --> 02:51:23.410]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:51:23.830 --> 02:51:27.291]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:51:27.631 --> 02:51:28.632]  How much will you need?
[02:51:28.872 --> 02:51:29.493]  We don't know.
[02:51:29.773 --> 02:51:30.673]  How much do you want?
[02:51:30.874 --> 02:51:31.594]  All you can get.
[02:51:31.794 --> 02:51:32.655]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:32.895 --> 02:51:35.657]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:51:35.938 --> 02:51:36.298]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:51:36.478 --> 02:51:38.580]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:39.601]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:51:39.621 --> 02:51:43.844]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:52:28.411 --> 02:52:35.556]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are into our number overdrive, into our fifth hour today.
[02:52:35.616 --> 02:52:37.997]  I did five hours and 15 minutes yesterday.
[02:52:38.017 --> 02:52:45.962]  We're only going to do about 30 more today and take a few of the callers that are left over from the live transmissions on the AM and FM, XM, everything else.
[02:52:46.382 --> 02:52:53.607]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, with his inside intel, this former big three oil company executive, has given him so many key insights before.
[02:52:54.387 --> 02:52:57.049]  Lindsey, you went over the fact that they are looking at using a nuke.
[02:52:57.549 --> 02:53:06.157]  The fact that you're saying it's 20,000 to 70,000 pressure, that they went into some type of magma chamber, a volcano.
[02:53:06.177 --> 02:53:11.902]  I mean, they're drilling down to the ends of the crust, close to the mantle.
[02:53:12.302 --> 02:53:16.045]  And we know they have these bathalyphs and other things that are forming.
[02:53:17.353 --> 02:53:18.654]  So you're very, very serious.
[02:53:18.674 --> 02:53:21.955]  And we're seeing this kind of being dribbled out now.
[02:53:21.995 --> 02:53:26.957]  We've seen the propaganda of, oh, they've fixed the leak over and over again to give false hope.
[02:53:27.397 --> 02:53:31.978]  And, oh, there's only a few thousand gallons, then 50,000, then 100,000, then 200,000.
[02:53:32.298 --> 02:53:33.859]  Now they say it's a half million.
[02:53:34.179 --> 02:53:36.000]  Now they're saying they're underestimating that.
[02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:41.702]  You're saying your oil company sources are saying, what, four to five million gallons a day?
[02:53:42.771 --> 02:53:47.356]  Yes, but I'm quite sure that they were being very conservative because they knew I was going to quote them.
[02:53:47.936 --> 02:53:51.620]  And so you can put it very much above that.
[02:53:53.342 --> 02:53:59.228]  Okay, so let's run through recapping what you've already broke and the other news you didn't have the time to get to while I was taking calls.
[02:54:00.618 --> 02:54:06.379]  Okay, first of all, I want to touch on a subject that you just casually mentioned at the beginning of your program.
[02:54:06.879 --> 02:54:22.062]  You said that Goldman Sachs sold much of their BP stock only a few days just prior to the Gulf War gusher, and that BP's president sold one-third of his stocks just prior to the gusher.
[02:54:22.082 --> 02:54:23.722]  Yeah, BP sold 44 percent, he sold a third.
[02:54:24.002 --> 02:54:29.663]  Turns out that Goldman Sachs, chairman of International, was also the chairman of BP, but got out a month before.
[02:54:30.464 --> 02:54:35.547]  I'm so glad that you mentioned this because it gives me an opportunity to say it, otherwise I wouldn't have dared do it.
[02:54:36.748 --> 02:54:38.449]  I've lived with these people for three years.
[02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:44.193]  The average person has not the slightest idea as to the mindset of the elite.
[02:54:44.733 --> 02:54:49.236]  I have written three books attempting to tell people how these people think.
[02:54:50.217 --> 02:54:52.918]  The elite are a part of the occult.
[02:54:53.079 --> 02:54:54.239]  Are you catching me, folks?
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:59.643]  Now, keep in mind, I've been a minister of the Gospel, the Bible, for 50 years.
[02:55:00.513 --> 02:55:03.556]  I lived with these elites for three years.
[02:55:04.017 --> 02:55:06.399]  They are a part of the occult.
[02:55:06.820 --> 02:55:10.804]  You wonder why did Goldman Sachs sell the stock so many days ahead of time?
[02:55:11.264 --> 02:55:13.446]  Their occultist connections told them to.
[02:55:13.706 --> 02:55:20.954]  You've got to understand that we're dealing with a spiritual warfare here that is so far beyond the imagination of the average person.
[02:55:22.955 --> 02:55:28.801]  Unless you lived with him, you couldn't understand why BP, the president, would sell this amount of stock.
[02:55:29.101 --> 02:55:31.423]  It wasn't that he knew this thing was going to blow.
[02:55:31.883 --> 02:55:37.568]  It's that his occultic connections... Alex, you have even made a video on the occult.
[02:55:37.648 --> 02:55:41.912]  I know it was... You went out to California and... Yeah, Bohemian Grove.
[02:55:41.992 --> 02:55:43.153]  I mean, it's even admitted that...
[02:55:44.594 --> 02:55:55.284]  These people are a part of the occult, and as a result, they knew in advance what to do, not because they knew this thing was going to blow, but because the occultic connections had told them so.
[02:55:56.785 --> 02:56:05.393]  Well, the word is, and I'm not into the occult, but I've had people that are into astrology, well-known businessmen here in Austin, I'm not going to say names, that have visited me, saying that
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:11.684]  You know, there's going to be catastrophe in the next few months, and this was before the spill.
[02:56:11.724 --> 02:56:19.051]  There's going to be all this stuff happening, and it's going to get worse and worse going into July, because, you know, the astrology says it.
[02:56:19.452 --> 02:56:26.518]  And I know that Ronald Reagan made every decision he did, down to the minute of a speech, to the color of his tie, off of his astrologer.
[02:56:27.139 --> 02:56:33.824]  And I'm not bashing Ronald Reagan because when you go to mainstream news about Tony Blair, he goes all over the world doing these rituals.
[02:56:34.265 --> 02:56:38.848]  Every morning he's possessed by something called the Spirit of the Light and flops around on the ground.
[02:56:39.388 --> 02:56:40.309]  So is his wife.
[02:56:40.709 --> 02:56:41.970]  France saw a meter on him.
[02:56:42.771 --> 02:56:49.515]  Paid the architect to have 666 pink pieces of glass to make the Louvre pyramid.
[02:56:49.995 --> 02:56:52.777]  He has publicly said he worships Lucifer.
[02:56:53.317 --> 02:57:10.468]  And yes, they believe that just like George Washington thought, you know, the God of the Bible was giving him guidance, that these elitists, whether they're psychic or whatever, and then manifested through the occult, they believe they're being guided by their spirit guides.
[02:57:11.368 --> 02:57:11.889]  And they are.
[02:57:12.899 --> 02:57:15.901]  You've got to believe they are, and they're spirit guides.
[02:57:15.921 --> 02:57:18.122]  You see, there are two gods in this universe.
[02:57:18.142 --> 02:57:26.788]  There's the true and living God of the Bible who created all of heaven and earth and sent his Son to die for us on the cross as a forgiveness and perpetuation of our sins.
[02:57:27.168 --> 02:57:37.354]  Then there is the Prince of the Power of the Air, the God of this world, better known by the average person as Lucifer or the Devil, and these people serve that God.
[02:57:40.762 --> 02:57:46.706]  Well, I tell you, they sure believe they're getting this goblin guidance.
[02:57:48.007 --> 02:57:54.611]  All I know is that every one of these creatures started dumping their stock at record levels right before this happened, Lindsey.
[02:57:56.141 --> 02:58:03.804]  Well, let me assure you that from every source that I have talked with, that what happened in the Gulf of Mexico was positively an accident.
[02:58:04.384 --> 02:58:05.384]  It was not planned.
[02:58:05.724 --> 02:58:08.325]  It is not a part of any conspiracy.
[02:58:08.345 --> 02:58:15.468]  Well, if their devils could tell them this was going to happen, or whatever interdimensional creatures they're communicating with, that's what they believe they're doing.
[02:58:15.768 --> 02:58:17.669]  I mean, even if it's not true, folks, that's what they believe.
[02:58:18.169 --> 02:58:21.090]  I mean, that's just raw research.
[02:58:21.150 --> 02:58:21.950]  I keep running into that.
[02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:22.890]  That's what they're really into.
[02:58:24.711 --> 02:58:30.814]  If they've got these connections, why couldn't the creatures tell them that the oil spill was coming?
[02:58:32.295 --> 02:58:34.276]  Alright, that gets me down to my next point.
[02:58:35.157 --> 02:58:37.298]  And I'm glad you led into it perfectly, Alex.
[02:58:37.318 --> 02:58:38.719]  We're thinking exactly alike.
[02:58:39.432 --> 02:58:54.752]  So, after I talked with my Mr. X, with the book Energy Non-Crisis, after I had communicated with a number of other oil people, and have you noticed, Alex, that every person who has called into your show today has agreed with what this Mr. X told me?
[02:58:55.393 --> 02:58:59.375]  Now, folks, I do not take credit for any of this.
[02:58:59.995 --> 02:59:14.021]  I must say emphatically that it is by the providence of God that I was ever allowed to be the chaplain on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline and given executive status and sat in the board meetings, and I do not take credit for the things I'm saying today.
[02:59:14.041 --> 02:59:20.604]  I knew nothing about such things as that cap that was on the well, the fail-safe valve, and all this.
[02:59:20.844 --> 02:59:24.726]  This lingo, I didn't even recognize it until this individual told me.
[02:59:25.393 --> 02:59:33.077]  And the fact that they went into a strata, please use the proper words, because the oil people will laugh at us if we don't.
[02:59:33.837 --> 02:59:43.082]  They went into a strata of oil that is so phenomenal that no company, including the Russians, have ever drilled into it before.
[02:59:43.102 --> 02:59:48.125]  Now keeping all of this in mind, after I had talked with these people about this, I said, okay,
[02:59:50.816 --> 02:59:53.879]  How does this fit in?
[02:59:54.419 --> 02:59:58.063]  I had to be very vague and try to get an answer out of Alex.
[03:00:00.561 --> 03:00:03.143]  I stand here shuddering almost.
[03:00:03.643 --> 03:00:21.375]  The elite, even though they did not create this, even though they did not know it was going to happen except by the occultic words, the elite planned to use this disaster to accomplish their timeline of 2010 and 2012 exactly as was given to me by the 87-year-old elitist
[03:00:26.238 --> 03:00:27.479]  And I appeared on your show.
[03:00:27.979 --> 03:00:29.140]  I gave every bit of it.
[03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:31.261]  It's on my six DVD set.
[03:00:31.681 --> 03:00:33.182]  Eight hours of DVD viewing.
[03:00:33.662 --> 03:00:47.650]  And they have told me that they are going to use this gulf scenario as a method of accomplishing their timeline for 2010 and 2012 exactly as they told me they were going to do it.
[03:00:48.070 --> 03:00:49.851]  And folks, they will.
[03:00:50.211 --> 03:00:51.072]  You have it coming.
[03:00:51.612 --> 03:00:53.113]  Now, my opinion.
[03:00:53.689 --> 03:01:02.817]  From what I have heard from Mr. X and my VP informants, you are not going to see this world captain anytime soon.
[03:01:03.498 --> 03:01:05.759]  Alex, I'm making a prediction here.
[03:01:06.580 --> 03:01:19.531]  I think, I think that you probably are going to be calling me every few weeks for an update and I'm going to be calling Mr. X every so many days for an update because we are going to see a
[03:01:21.913 --> 03:01:48.443]  At an event of such epic proportion that it is going to devastate much of the finances and the people of the United States of America, and will get Mr. Obama's programs through exactly like he wants them, and the elite have already told me that everything they gave me a year and a half ago, that they are going to use this as one of the major methods, now that it's happened, of getting their 2012 timeline done, Alex.
[03:01:51.001 --> 03:02:01.545]  Well, we're looking at a live feed right now of the oil gusher, and I mean, it is in that incredible pressure that would crush any submarine we've got that's manned.
[03:02:01.565 --> 03:02:09.989]  They've got some submersibles that aren't manned that can go down that far, obviously, because they're down there working on it, but it is just blasting
[03:02:10.689 --> 03:02:16.853]  Blasting out of the hole there, and it's so hard to work in 5,000 feet of water.
[03:02:17.154 --> 03:02:27.241]  We looked up this email about vanadium, this highly toxic chemical, and sure enough I've got Huffington Post, I've got major oil sites.
[03:02:28.101 --> 03:02:37.763]  This is composited from, it says, in addition to hydrocarbons, crude oil has organic compounds that contain nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen, as well as carbon and hydrogen.
[03:02:38.143 --> 03:02:40.604]  It also contains trace minerals, salts, and metals.
[03:02:41.004 --> 03:02:51.306]  The most common metal is nickel, vanadium, iron, copper, but can also include very small amounts of metals like uranium, arsenic, and mercury.
[03:02:51.866 --> 03:02:56.827]  And this strata of oil that we're talking about could just be amazing.
[03:02:58.107 --> 03:03:07.575]  I understand when they're going for oil, they call the different layers they're hitting different strata of oil and natural gas, different gas sands and a different strata of the rock.
[03:03:08.095 --> 03:03:14.500]  But what I'm saying is, if they're going down this deep, we know that these magma chambers can come up right to the surface.
[03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:15.701]  That's what a volcano is.
[03:03:16.142 --> 03:03:25.129]  And a lot of people think they may have drilled down into the magma or something that's in between that because of how unusual this is.
[03:03:25.469 --> 03:03:27.331]  So that's the point I'm making about that, Lindsey.
[03:03:28.171 --> 03:03:36.576]  The only thing that I was assured of is that they have drilled into a strata that more than likely no other human being has ever gone into in the history of the world.
[03:03:37.176 --> 03:03:42.679]  It is what is called a super deep well, and because of it, they hit pressures that even Russia didn't.
[03:03:43.679 --> 03:03:46.561]  This is what I'm assured of by my informants.
[03:03:47.121 --> 03:03:53.525]  As a result of that, to stop this thing by natural methods that have already been devised will be an impossibility.
[03:03:54.405 --> 03:03:58.666]  A nuke is probably the only way to do it and I think everybody's scared to death.
[03:03:58.786 --> 03:04:11.790]  But they could blow out the whole thing and the pressure could be so powerful that it just goes through the cracks and then you've got an even bigger mess and now you've got some two mile wide cracked, you know, mishmash and it never ends.
[03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:14.571]  Well, you crack that strata further.
[03:04:14.651 --> 03:04:18.592]  See, they drilled into it with a pipe and 25 to 30,000 feet down plus 5,000 feet of water.
[03:04:22.919 --> 03:04:26.380]  When they drilled into that, they have already gone into it.
[03:04:26.520 --> 03:04:38.362]  But, you go down with a nuke, and crack it further, and it'll be a total impossibility to ever, in the history of the world, to fill that back up until the day that it has emptied itself.
[03:04:38.662 --> 03:04:40.983]  That would be so catastrophic, you don't even want to think about it.
[03:04:41.003 --> 03:04:49.665]  And if the abiotic theory is true, and all the evidence is beginning to point towards it being true, more and more petroleum geologists are saying something's going on, these wells are replenishing,
[03:04:50.185 --> 03:04:51.306]  Now, this is not finite.
[03:04:51.566 --> 03:04:52.666]  It could be an unlimited!
[03:04:52.686 --> 03:05:01.851]  I mean, the Gulf of Mexico could become known as the Black La Brea Tar Pit, and it could literally destroy the beaches of the planet for hundreds of years!
[03:05:03.051 --> 03:05:07.694]  Uh, Alex, our radio talk show host, whom I will not mention, called me on yesterday.
[03:05:07.854 --> 03:05:08.914]  He is very well known.
[03:05:09.635 --> 03:05:18.219]  He said, Chaplain, I was supposed to have a person on my program tonight who is a tourist rep.
[03:05:18.940 --> 03:05:22.063]  Uh, in the Keys, down towards Key West, awful Florida.
[03:05:23.024 --> 03:05:26.347]  And he said, uh, I had scheduled them.
[03:05:27.028 --> 03:05:28.749]  They were going to be on my program tonight.
[03:05:29.110 --> 03:05:30.171]  Can you fill in for them?
[03:05:30.211 --> 03:05:30.731]  I said, no.
[03:05:31.252 --> 03:05:33.574]  I promised Alex that I'd do his show first with this.
[03:05:34.154 --> 03:05:35.075]  And I kept my word.
[03:05:35.616 --> 03:05:36.216]  I said, why?
[03:05:36.757 --> 03:05:40.400]  He said, they called a few minutes ago, said that they were threatened.
[03:05:41.241 --> 03:05:44.584]  They were told not to appear on my program under any circumstances.
[03:05:45.382 --> 03:05:47.126]  There is a media blackout on this.
[03:05:47.687 --> 03:05:51.335]  I don't know what repercussions you may get for even having this program today.
[03:05:52.091 --> 03:05:55.752]  Some things have been said that could come from nowhere except inside sources.
[03:05:56.352 --> 03:06:03.334]  Even those people who have called into your program today have given details, but none of them have given intricacies, as you've heard.
[03:06:03.414 --> 03:06:04.995]  No, no, I want to be specific.
[03:06:05.855 --> 03:06:09.456]  I know the oil company executive, so does Dr. Monti from separate research.
[03:06:09.476 --> 03:06:10.076]  He's called him.
[03:06:10.556 --> 03:06:11.397]  I know you're for real.
[03:06:11.477 --> 03:06:15.458]  I mean, I know that you've been exposing this for 30 years and that you did work
[03:06:16.238 --> 03:06:20.244]  With these big oil companies and that you do have these sources and everything you said makes sense.
[03:06:21.106 --> 03:06:26.073]  Lindsey Williams, I wish you were wrong and I wish I would have gotten you on earlier because you've been calling this week.
[03:06:26.454 --> 03:06:28.557]  But I, you know, just at a subconscious level...
[03:06:29.804 --> 03:06:31.445]  I don't want to believe things are bad.
[03:06:31.785 --> 03:06:34.106]  You know, people think I just jump to conclusions.
[03:06:34.306 --> 03:06:34.746]  I don't.
[03:06:35.487 --> 03:06:44.911]  People were telling me four days ago there's troops all over the Gulf intimidating people and now more and more it looks like that's true and they admit there's National Guard everywhere and so I guess that's happening.
[03:06:45.391 --> 03:06:49.773]  You know, I mean when somebody calls me and says there's Marines 300 miles from the border
[03:06:50.433 --> 03:06:52.334]  You know, searching people at checkpoints.
[03:06:52.494 --> 03:06:53.174]  I don't believe it.
[03:06:53.314 --> 03:06:58.215]  And then I get the state police press release and photos of it, and it's in the newspaper.
[03:06:58.596 --> 03:07:09.079]  I mean, it's just at a certain point, I can't believe all over the country they're taking people's homes for $360 unpaid water bills and $200 unpaid power bills and water bills.
[03:07:09.139 --> 03:07:16.141]  And I've got an article here today, you know, Star Tribune, in jail for being in debt.
[03:07:16.761 --> 03:07:18.482]  It's not a crime to owe money to debtors.
[03:07:18.542 --> 03:07:21.003]  Prisons are abolished in the United States in the 19th century.
[03:07:21.263 --> 03:07:26.506]  The people are routinely being thrown into jail for failing to pay debts to even private corporations.
[03:07:26.586 --> 03:07:30.727]  I mean, there's not even a law they're putting them in jail, Lindsey Williams.
[03:07:30.768 --> 03:07:32.909]  I mean, you know, I've got articles here.
[03:07:32.929 --> 03:07:37.291]  I mean, I'm finally getting overwhelmed.
[03:07:37.331 --> 03:07:39.952]  I mean, it's finally getting too insane, and I don't even
[03:07:41.547 --> 03:07:46.750]  You know, I guess the Bible says they wear out the saints with all their chicanery and their enjoyment of it.
[03:07:46.810 --> 03:07:50.252]  I'm not saying I'm a saint or anything, but I feel worn out sometimes.
[03:07:50.653 --> 03:07:54.075]  I know you must feel worn out, you know, 30, 40 years fighting this.
[03:07:54.195 --> 03:07:55.656]  I don't know, 35 years, whatever it is.
[03:07:56.736 --> 03:08:03.440]  And I want to go to a few phone calls here, but also tell folks how to get that new DVD you've put out on this so it's all clearly laid out.
[03:08:04.241 --> 03:08:07.883]  But from what you're saying and what appears to be happening, I mean,
[03:08:08.103 --> 03:08:11.164]  The way they won't let the states protect themselves, so it's worse.
[03:08:11.585 --> 03:08:16.747]  The way they screwed up Katrina and made it as bad as they could, so they can say, oh look, FEMA needs more power.
[03:08:16.987 --> 03:08:20.109]  The way Obama now says, I'm going to get my carbon tax with this.
[03:08:20.869 --> 03:08:25.291]  The way they're now telling us it may go to Christmas, and they said it may go for a year.
[03:08:25.691 --> 03:08:27.312]  Now they say it may go for two years.
[03:08:27.672 --> 03:08:33.835]  It looks like they're getting us ready to just say the Gulf of Mexico is now going to be a black lagoon of toxic waste.
[03:08:35.014 --> 03:08:44.638]  Well, Alex, I have covered what actually has happened, and I have given you documented information.
[03:08:44.658 --> 03:08:50.240]  I have talked about what was happening, not only what did happen, but what is happening.
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:52.221]  Now I'd like to tell you what's going to happen.
[03:08:53.699 --> 03:08:56.580]  Uh, and I'll begin with John Hoffmeister.
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:08:59.561]  I'm going to back up all of this with names and dates.
[03:09:00.001 --> 03:09:01.381]  I don't dare get this without it.
[03:09:01.861 --> 03:09:09.764]  John Hoffmeister is the former president of Shell Oil, is the author of a book entitled, Why We Hate the Oil Companies.
[03:09:10.264 --> 03:09:11.484]  You can go find this for yourself.
[03:09:12.264 --> 03:09:13.385]  Now, here's what he says.
[03:09:13.845 --> 03:09:14.945]  The BP disaster
[03:09:15.811 --> 03:09:24.993]  ...has raised questions about halting risky domestic oil extraction procedures altogether, including deep water programs.
[03:09:25.413 --> 03:09:33.855]  Mark Hofmeister, a long-time advocate of more domestic drilling, says, America simply can't afford to stop drilling.
[03:09:34.635 --> 03:09:38.335]  America's net imports of foreign oil has jumped from 58.2 percent in 27
[03:09:42.557 --> 03:09:45.018]  From 34.8% in 1973.
[03:09:45.139 --> 03:09:47.460]  That's according to the US government.
[03:09:47.981 --> 03:10:07.034]  Now, Hofmeister says, while we dream about new energy systems decades from now, the price to consumers will have to pay for things like gasoline, electric, diesel, would just skyrocket if America halted offshore drilling.
[03:10:07.714 --> 03:10:11.277]  Prices could go to a point where fixed income and low
[03:10:13.151 --> 03:10:13.653]  I don't know.
[03:10:18.231 --> 03:10:25.355]  Which would be a shock and unnecessary because of our unwillingness to produce domestic resources.
[03:10:25.695 --> 03:10:27.236]  Now I'm going to give you his prediction.
[03:10:27.276 --> 03:10:27.717]  Here it is.
[03:10:28.077 --> 03:10:29.938]  What you going to be paying for gasoline?
[03:10:30.538 --> 03:10:32.900]  I'm surprised somebody hasn't asked that so far.
[03:10:33.320 --> 03:10:33.600]  I know.
[03:10:33.800 --> 03:10:35.041]  It's down at the pump right now.
[03:10:35.501 --> 03:10:36.682]  But you haven't seen anything yet.
[03:10:36.702 --> 03:10:47.028]  I'm going to tell you what is John Hoffmeister's statement because you remember the President of the United States of America said just recently he's going to halt all future
[03:10:47.768 --> 03:10:51.909]  Do you think that American public is going to say, we don't want the drilling offshore anymore?
[03:11:14.895 --> 03:11:16.396]  Well, here's what he says.
[03:11:19.039 --> 03:11:30.449]  If Americans say that, you are going to be accepting $6 to $8 per gallon at the gas pump as an alternate in the near future.
[03:11:31.232 --> 03:11:37.018]  Folks, you are going to be paying six to eight dollars at the gas pump in the near future.
[03:11:37.098 --> 03:11:39.601]  Well, Lindsey, I saw an AP article yesterday.
[03:11:40.362 --> 03:11:44.686]  I saw an AP article yesterday at Interrupt where all the foreign oil companies and U.S.
[03:11:44.746 --> 03:11:51.133]  oil companies that had their rigs out there already drilling, the headline was, oil companies pull up stakes in the Gulf.
[03:11:51.573 --> 03:11:52.894]  And they're all just leaving.
[03:11:53.054 --> 03:11:56.435]  No new exploration, even in areas in international waters.
[03:11:56.895 --> 03:11:57.475]  It's over.
[03:11:57.755 --> 03:12:02.597]  And now Obama's saying he's going to try to stop deep drilling in the United States.
[03:12:03.157 --> 03:12:08.960]  And this is the move to nationalize the oil companies that we're now going to see.
[03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:14.483]  You will be paying six to seven dollars a gallon at the gas pump.
[03:12:14.544 --> 03:12:17.066]  By the way, if you're going on vacation anywhere, go quick.
[03:12:33.416 --> 03:12:34.957]  Don't even wait until the end of the summer.
[03:12:35.517 --> 03:12:40.761]  You are going to be paying six to seven dollars a gallon at the gas pump in the very near future.
[03:12:40.781 --> 03:12:42.602]  And that means airline traffic's going to go up?
[03:12:43.422 --> 03:12:44.783]  All airlines will go bankrupt.
[03:12:44.903 --> 03:12:47.185]  There's no way that airlines can stand this.
[03:12:47.225 --> 03:12:49.967]  They'll nationalize the airlines, the government will take them over.
[03:12:50.507 --> 03:12:57.271]  Obama wants to make us a socialistic state, and he's going to do it because now he has the wherewithal to be able to.
[03:12:57.732 --> 03:12:59.373]  Now, I want to give you the other item, though.
[03:13:00.453 --> 03:13:02.014]  This one is future.
[03:13:03.995 --> 03:13:04.816]  I have to read this.
[03:13:05.257 --> 03:13:09.861]  The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may have apocalyptic consequences.
[03:13:10.362 --> 03:13:22.755]  A report of the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources said the British petroleum oil spill is threatening the entire eastern half of the North American continent with total destruction.
[03:13:23.610 --> 03:13:40.162]  Report says, an ominous report by Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources warned of the impending disaster resulting from the British petroleum, oil, and gas leak in the Gulf of Mexico, calling it the worst environmental catastrophe in all of human history.
[03:13:40.642 --> 03:13:48.628]  The European Union Times reported, Russian scientists believe BP... Oh folks, please write these words down.
[03:13:49.308 --> 03:13:50.969]  I'm going to spell them for you, just a moment.
[03:13:51.349 --> 03:14:11.737]  Russian scientists believe BP is pumping millions of gallons of Corexite, C-O-R-E-X-I-T-E 9,500, a chemical dispersing agent, under the Gulf of Mexico waters to hide the full extent of the leak, now estimated to be over 2.9 million gallons a day.
[03:14:14.458 --> 03:14:21.823]  Experts say Carzyte 9500 is a solvent more times more toxic than oil.
[03:14:22.063 --> 03:14:23.284]  Four times more toxic.
[03:14:23.684 --> 03:14:37.854]  The Asian scientists believe has a 2.61 ppm toxicity level and when mixed with the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, its molecules will be able to phase transition.
[03:14:38.554 --> 03:14:45.097]  This transition involves the change of the liquid into a gaseous state, which can be absorbed by clouds.
[03:14:45.537 --> 03:14:58.242]  The gas will then be released as toxic rain, leading to unimaginable environmental catastrophe, destroying all life forms from the bottom of the evolutionary chain to the top.
[03:15:02.263 --> 03:15:02.583]  Alex?
[03:15:02.943 --> 03:15:03.324]  Yes, sir.
[03:15:03.384 --> 03:15:04.104]  I'm listening here.
[03:15:04.144 --> 03:15:04.664]  Continue.
[03:15:05.524 --> 03:15:06.785]  Well, what are we going to see?
[03:15:07.941 --> 03:15:16.206]  If they don't contain this thing, and this is a big issue, I hope tomorrow morning that BP will be able to cap this whole thing.
[03:15:16.426 --> 03:15:17.187]  That is my wish.
[03:15:17.287 --> 03:15:17.827]  I'm begging.
[03:15:17.887 --> 03:15:18.427]  I'm pleading.
[03:15:19.748 --> 03:15:20.449]  I'm asking.
[03:15:20.529 --> 03:15:21.349]  Please do it.
[03:15:22.050 --> 03:15:22.610]  If they don't.
[03:15:24.091 --> 03:15:39.522]  If they don't, with the toxic gases that are coming out of this well with the oil, hydrogen sulfide, benzene, methylene chloride, and our stupid congressman up there, they haven't got the backbone of a jellyfish.
[03:15:40.042 --> 03:15:49.449]  They don't have an ounce of care for human beings, or they'd be telling them what the Environmental Protection Agency has found that is blowing over the land.
[03:15:49.469 --> 03:15:50.930]  Now, I was a pilot for 30 years.
[03:15:52.030 --> 03:16:05.036]  I know that prevailing winds are from the northwest to the southeast, and these gases are blowing over the Delta, over Florida, and if they do not cap this well,
[03:16:05.828 --> 03:16:08.649]  You are going to see people sick.
[03:16:08.949 --> 03:16:13.911]  You might even see an evacuation of certain parts of the Gulf and Florida.
[03:16:14.031 --> 03:16:23.635]  It is going to affect the finances, economy of this country in a way that you can't even imagine.
[03:16:23.935 --> 03:16:30.299]  Well I certainly hope that's not the case, but we're going to have to watch and see how that unfolds with Lindsey Williams.
[03:16:30.339 --> 03:16:37.743]  Lindsey, I want to take five calls, or six calls right now in quick succession and then let you go and we'll get updates from you as this unfolds.
[03:16:38.363 --> 03:16:40.605]  But before we go to these calls, give folks the
[03:16:41.525 --> 03:16:46.348]  The website and the phone number again, because you called me about this in the last four or five days.
[03:16:46.688 --> 03:16:53.872]  You've been working on a DVD that was just completed or shot yesterday, where you break all this down in a video format.
[03:16:54.992 --> 03:16:57.374]  Tell folks how they can get your breakdown of this information.
[03:16:58.174 --> 03:17:00.355]  I did a CD on yesterday.
[03:17:01.096 --> 03:17:02.196]  We had to do it quickly.
[03:17:02.376 --> 03:17:03.137]  Oh, so it's audio, okay.
[03:17:03.157 --> 03:17:04.798]  To be able to get this information out.
[03:17:05.238 --> 03:17:09.560]  All of what I've said today is on there, plus I have pages of information that's not there.
[03:17:10.100 --> 03:17:10.761]  I beg of you.
[03:17:11.667 --> 03:17:15.488]  You know my DVDs and CDs are not copywritten.
[03:17:15.888 --> 03:17:18.688]  You must get this out to millions of Americans.
[03:17:19.149 --> 03:17:20.009]  Alex Jones Show.
[03:17:20.209 --> 03:17:22.609]  You've got to get everybody to go on the web and look at it.
[03:17:23.109 --> 03:17:32.731]  Please call and get my 8 DVD set and the one that we produced on yesterday, which will tell you everything that's going on in the Gulf.
[03:17:32.811 --> 03:17:34.152]  The toll-free number is 888.
[03:17:36.930 --> 03:17:37.070]  888-799-6111.
[03:17:37.090 --> 03:17:43.014]  Now some people don't like to talk to an operator.
[03:17:43.674 --> 03:17:48.437]  Please go on the web to prophecyclub.com.
[03:17:48.457 --> 03:17:49.718]  You can get it there if you wish.
[03:17:49.758 --> 03:17:57.362]  That's p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y-c-l-u-b.com or our toll free number 888-799-6111.
[03:18:02.735 --> 03:18:09.597]  6-1-1-1, the operator standing by, and oh, by the way, they will have English voices.
[03:18:09.997 --> 03:18:11.317]  It won't be a foreign operator.
[03:18:11.697 --> 03:18:13.658]  You're going to get an American that you talk with.
[03:18:13.698 --> 03:18:14.878]  Well, I know this, Lindsey.
[03:18:14.898 --> 03:18:18.619]  We're going to be able to sit here and watch this unfold and see what happens.
[03:18:18.779 --> 03:18:20.099]  Always interesting information.
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:23.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[03:18:23.060 --> 03:18:23.900]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:18:25.501 --> 03:18:26.221]  Thank you, sir.
[03:18:26.897 --> 03:18:28.158]  Yes.
[03:18:28.258 --> 03:18:29.860]  Okay, so I saw you disconnect it then.
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:40.428]  My only thought I could think of offhand, being a personal engineer, so to speak, is fill all the fissures up with cement and then drop a million pound weight over the center of a gun, see if that'll cork it up.
[03:18:40.448 --> 03:18:44.432]  Because it'd be corking up and then it would just whiz out of the other cracks a lot harder.
[03:18:44.452 --> 03:18:46.193]  That's a heck of a lot of pressure, sir.
[03:18:46.713 --> 03:18:51.938]  Otherwise, the only thing I could recommend is ignite it under the water and let it burn before it gets to the top.
[03:18:52.998 --> 03:18:58.541]  Well, that's what a lot of experts said was it should have been ignited the old-fashioned way, you know, right after it started leaking.
[03:18:58.561 --> 03:19:05.664]  That way it would all be contained and just turn into carbon, you know, carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere and a few other byproducts.
[03:19:05.704 --> 03:19:08.725]  Certainly not perfect, but better than what we're seeing now.
[03:19:09.526 --> 03:19:13.808]  But yeah, what about the idea of, say, having a million-pound weight
[03:19:14.948 --> 03:19:21.452]  Uh, that, uh, they then, you know, a position, uh, over it and then drop on top of it.
[03:19:21.472 --> 03:19:25.515]  Um, I'm no engineer, but I mean, that might have an effect.
[03:19:25.575 --> 03:19:31.939]  But then, if it doesn't work, you've got oil coming out from beneath the weight, and it's even harder to get under there and take care of it.
[03:19:34.631 --> 03:19:39.453]  Well, oxygen and hydrogen will burn underwater as well if it's got enough oxygen to it.
[03:19:39.493 --> 03:19:42.895]  You could just burn it before it gets through the water and use the water as a filter.
[03:19:42.915 --> 03:19:50.379]  It would probably need to be filtered as well after it burnt, but at least it wouldn't be escaping into the atmosphere and just have the potential to get all the way around the globe.
[03:19:52.139 --> 03:19:53.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:19:53.180 --> 03:19:55.761]  Well, I mean, it's just getting crazier and crazier because
[03:19:57.833 --> 03:20:08.624]  Government doesn't know how to get rid of it and now they're talking about a nuke and I just can't imagine if they detonate a nuke down there and it just causes more fissures and then instead of having one leak
[03:20:10.087 --> 03:20:12.610]  It creates a bunch of other cracks in underground channels.
[03:20:13.151 --> 03:20:24.544]  You could have a mess many times worse, and instead of a half million or a million or whatever it really is, four or five million, like some of the Lindsay sources are saying, then it could be ten million, twenty million.
[03:20:25.084 --> 03:20:29.769]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy to talk about using nuclear weapons down there.
[03:20:30.350 --> 03:20:37.256]  And I sure hope they haven't hit some new strata of oil, some new mega strata, and that this sucker could go on for years.
[03:20:37.316 --> 03:20:42.700]  I mean, this is... And can you imagine how government's going to say, listen, we got the solution.
[03:20:43.260 --> 03:20:58.533]  You pay Al Gore and the Rothschilds a big tax, and they'll wave an environmental wand, and see, we've got to get rid of the petroleum economy, and we've got to take control of society and make you all energy poor because of the oil spill, because of the oil spill, because of the oil spill.
[03:20:59.013 --> 03:21:02.115]  And how this is happening right on time for Obama.
[03:21:02.395 --> 03:21:04.156]  Yes, it's politically destroying him.
[03:21:04.516 --> 03:21:05.937]  It's going to politically hurt BP.
[03:21:06.217 --> 03:21:13.001]  But one thing I've found with the globalists is they will fall on the sword individually to give more power to the organization.
[03:21:13.482 --> 03:21:14.442]  In fact, here's the headline.
[03:21:14.482 --> 03:21:17.364]  As spill costs mounts, BP shares tumble anew.
[03:21:17.784 --> 03:21:17.985]  U.S.
[03:21:18.025 --> 03:21:19.545]  lawmakers want more compensation.
[03:21:19.605 --> 03:21:21.507]  Obama, Cameron to discuss issue.
[03:21:21.527 --> 03:21:22.267]  Appreciate the call, Mike.
[03:21:22.287 --> 03:21:22.727]  Good points.
[03:21:23.568 --> 03:21:26.750]  Lindsey Williams, what's your take on the idea he had for dropping a big weight on it?
[03:21:27.475 --> 03:21:35.239]  A number of years ago I was on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline and they put in that 800 mile pipe over an inch thick.
[03:21:35.339 --> 03:21:38.381]  Two weeks ago BP closed the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[03:21:38.401 --> 03:21:40.002]  There's no oil flowing through it today.
[03:21:40.442 --> 03:21:49.567]  The reason being is that the abrasive substances in oil and the pig that they must run down that pipe from time to time to get out all the paraffin
[03:21:50.795 --> 03:21:52.036]  I don't know.
[03:22:07.191 --> 03:22:07.791]  We're good to go.
[03:22:29.964 --> 03:22:34.710]  I mean, this was a subject we didn't even cover before because there's still so much material here.
[03:22:35.071 --> 03:22:38.836]  But that very easily could happen, and that pipe is eroding by the minute.
[03:22:40.114 --> 03:22:42.835]  Well, look what rivers do to create the Grand Canyon.
[03:22:42.935 --> 03:22:45.236]  Water cuts through solid rock over time.
[03:22:45.656 --> 03:22:51.778]  Imagine what oil, with all those chemicals just blasting out, is going to do to that pipe.
[03:22:53.078 --> 03:22:59.781]  But again, it looks like the casing's already not intact, because you've got all these other leaks coming up around there.
[03:22:59.841 --> 03:23:00.721]  This doesn't look good.
[03:23:01.522 --> 03:23:08.345]  The casing appears to have ruptured at the time of the original blow because the pressure was so high.
[03:23:08.705 --> 03:23:09.625]  That's what it appears.
[03:23:09.665 --> 03:23:18.709]  You notice how I use the word appears because we're getting these fissures as much as, you know, it ain't set up to 20 miles long.
[03:23:18.729 --> 03:23:22.190]  The furthest I've heard, personally, is five miles away.
[03:23:22.491 --> 03:23:26.012]  But these are being caused by other ruptures that are down in there somewhere.
[03:23:26.332 --> 03:23:27.993]  Josh in Alabama, you're on the air.
[03:23:30.831 --> 03:23:32.211]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:23:32.231 --> 03:23:44.635]  I just want to let you know, I was down in Gulf Shores, Alabama yesterday, and there's a very large amount of tar balls all over the beach down there.
[03:23:44.655 --> 03:23:47.476]  I just wanted to confirm that for you.
[03:23:48.336 --> 03:23:53.598]  Also, there was a private company called Queen Harbor.
[03:23:53.818 --> 03:23:56.198]  There was probably 10 guys on ATVs
[03:23:59.568 --> 03:24:05.731]  And we spent probably three hours there, and I'm heading back out of town, north on 59th.
[03:24:05.771 --> 03:24:13.415]  So, two Humvees, probably four or five troops per Humvee.
[03:24:14.556 --> 03:24:17.857]  So you're asking... Now, we know military's down there.
[03:24:17.897 --> 03:24:21.399]  We're just curious if they're telling people to evacuate like some reports have said.
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:23.400]  Nothing, nothing.
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:25.481]  It was just totally benign.
[03:24:25.521 --> 03:24:28.603]  They were heading north out of town, but that's all we saw.
[03:24:28.991 --> 03:24:30.652]  Now, do these tarballs look fresh?
[03:24:30.672 --> 03:24:32.453]  Do they have any crustaceans growing on them?
[03:24:33.734 --> 03:24:35.675]  No, they're really liquidy.
[03:24:36.795 --> 03:24:39.197]  We had them smashed on the bottom of our feet.
[03:24:39.717 --> 03:24:44.039]  So they're new, yeah, because an old tarball will have crustaceans and things growing on it.
[03:24:44.639 --> 03:24:46.220]  I mean, I know they're going to the beach over the years.
[03:24:46.280 --> 03:24:53.984]  So, sounds like, like Lindsey said, it's coming out and getting semi-frozen and then congealing 5,000 feet down.
[03:24:54.025 --> 03:24:55.225]  I mean, it's just freezing cold.
[03:24:55.525 --> 03:24:56.306]  Anything else, Josh?
[03:24:57.438 --> 03:24:57.958]  That's it.
[03:24:57.978 --> 03:24:58.279]  Thank you.
[03:24:58.379 --> 03:24:59.920]  Thank you, Josh, so much for that call.
[03:25:00.640 --> 03:25:02.221]  Let's talk to Mike in New Orleans.
[03:25:02.401 --> 03:25:04.042]  Well, boy, they got Katrina and now this.
[03:25:04.742 --> 03:25:05.843]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[03:25:05.903 --> 03:25:06.223]  Welcome.
[03:25:07.104 --> 03:25:09.505]  Yes, thanks for taking my call.
[03:25:09.645 --> 03:25:13.588]  I work, I write for an independent newspaper in New Orleans.
[03:25:14.408 --> 03:25:17.570]  I have two deep sources that have their feet on the ground.
[03:25:19.211 --> 03:25:22.493]  I have, I will tell you what I have confirmed.
[03:25:24.805 --> 03:25:30.310]  What I have confirmed is that BP is in charge of everything.
[03:25:30.350 --> 03:25:32.312]  And when I say everything, I mean everything.
[03:25:32.752 --> 03:25:34.374]  They are in charge of the police.
[03:25:34.434 --> 03:25:37.157]  They are in charge of it all.
[03:25:38.658 --> 03:25:45.304]  They are and do have a complete media blackout of what's going on.
[03:25:45.385 --> 03:25:47.386]  They will not allow any cameras in.
[03:25:50.124 --> 03:25:54.072]  There's no confirmation yet on arrest, but they are threatening arrest.
[03:25:55.109 --> 03:26:01.871]  They have all of that area, all of the people in that area, completely intimidated.
[03:26:02.552 --> 03:26:03.852]  Nobody's talking to anybody.
[03:26:03.872 --> 03:26:13.475]  Well, two weeks ago they were pulling up to CBS and ABC and local reporters with the Coast Guard saying, we work for BP, under orders of BP, no videotaping beaches.
[03:26:13.775 --> 03:26:18.337]  So I guess BP is, instead of getting in trouble for this, they may become our new kings or something.
[03:26:19.209 --> 03:26:23.731]  There's an army, I'm telling you, there's an army of BP thugs down there.
[03:26:24.092 --> 03:26:30.715]  So far, it's only been the Coast Guard and the local authorities that are working in conjunction with them.
[03:26:31.155 --> 03:26:45.363]  There has been no sightings of any military, but all from what I have just heard, and all from the feeling that is going on, I can only speculate that... Well, one of the BP... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:26:46.144 --> 03:26:52.568]  Yeah, I can only speculate, especially if a storm comes along that we're going to be looking at mass evacuations from this area.
[03:26:53.288 --> 03:26:55.989]  Now what are the BP, you call them thugs, what are they doing?
[03:26:56.009 --> 03:26:58.211]  Just letting you know that they're in command and you're scum?
[03:26:59.167 --> 03:26:59.787]  More than that.
[03:27:01.088 --> 03:27:17.237]  They are, beyond intimidating the workers into signing non-disclosure forms, they are reports, and this is confirmed, of them having the crews stand down as swaths of oil has washed ashore.
[03:27:19.138 --> 03:27:19.978]  This is confirmed.
[03:27:20.458 --> 03:27:23.640]  So wait, they have the crews stand down and they let the oil come in?
[03:27:24.401 --> 03:27:24.761]  Correct.
[03:27:25.581 --> 03:27:26.762]  And do people ask why?
[03:27:28.101 --> 03:27:28.882]  They're intimidated.
[03:27:29.022 --> 03:27:31.003]  They're scared to death.
[03:27:31.043 --> 03:27:31.764]  What's the feeling?
[03:27:31.804 --> 03:27:39.150]  Is this so Barry Sitaro, Barack Hussein Obama, President Hussein can get his environmental takeover?
[03:27:39.190 --> 03:27:40.671]  I mean, why let the oil come in?
[03:27:40.971 --> 03:27:45.575]  Why, a month ago, not let the locals put the booms in front of the estuaries?
[03:27:45.615 --> 03:27:46.696]  Why'd they let that come in?
[03:27:47.654 --> 03:27:48.615]  Indeed.
[03:27:48.715 --> 03:27:58.621]  Again, confirmation that the BP people abandoned 44 boats that were ready to go out there and corral the first oil that was coming into the marshes.
[03:27:59.122 --> 03:28:01.003]  They just abandoned them as oil.
[03:28:01.023 --> 03:28:02.504]  Well, I want to continue with you, Mike.
[03:28:02.544 --> 03:28:06.647]  If you want to plug your independent newspaper, we'd like to have you down there as a reporter so we can talk to you.
[03:28:06.987 --> 03:28:08.968]  I'm going to do more shows just on this now.
[03:28:09.429 --> 03:28:12.071]  I'm beginning to realize this is just getting worse and worse by the minute.
[03:28:14.392 --> 03:28:18.594]  Lindsey, again, everything he's saying dovetails with what you've been saying.
[03:28:19.435 --> 03:28:24.237]  Every call that you've had call in today, from the technician to you name it,
[03:28:24.958 --> 03:28:29.400]  Has basically confirmed everything that Mr. X of my book, Energy Non-Crisis, told me.
[03:28:29.880 --> 03:28:33.682]  I am so glad this be the case, because I didn't have the slightest idea.
[03:28:33.762 --> 03:28:35.502]  This is the first time I've given this, Alex.
[03:28:35.923 --> 03:28:41.145]  Do you realize how bold you are, Alex Jones, to allow this program to go on today?
[03:28:41.625 --> 03:28:45.586]  I really wanted, you know, I heard you and George Norrie on Monday night, by the way, you did a great job.
[03:28:45.947 --> 03:28:48.888]  He asked you the story about the oil spill down there.
[03:28:50.549 --> 03:28:51.509]  I noticed at the time,
[03:28:52.530 --> 03:28:56.476]  I wonder, is he really going to allow me to be on today and tell this story?
[03:28:56.796 --> 03:29:00.541]  You are a bold talk show host to even allow this to be told.
[03:29:00.902 --> 03:29:02.264]  Well, when are you going to get on Norrie?
[03:29:02.324 --> 03:29:08.672]  I hope he's not the guy you were waiting, you know, waiting to get on me before you go on him because I appreciate you doing that, Lindsey.
[03:29:09.053 --> 03:29:10.614]  I haven't even called George Mallory at all.
[03:29:10.915 --> 03:29:14.598]  I called your producer the other day and... Well, thank you.
[03:29:14.638 --> 03:29:17.420]  We need to get you on... We need to get you on... ...exclusive, and I did.
[03:29:17.901 --> 03:29:21.043]  But, you know, if you want to put in a word for a movie, George, that would be fine.
[03:29:21.083 --> 03:29:24.266]  No, we need to get you on more shows right away because this is important.
[03:29:24.987 --> 03:29:28.590]  Call George and tell him I can answer all those questions for him.
[03:29:29.230 --> 03:29:29.931]  Well, absolutely.
[03:29:29.971 --> 03:29:30.712]  I'll let him know that.
[03:29:30.932 --> 03:29:34.375]  I don't have really any control over who or what they put on, but I can certainly recommend it.
[03:29:36.201 --> 03:29:45.429]  Just expanding on that, though, you're saying it was an accident, but they're going to let it continue to flow as a pretext to take over.
[03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:46.350]  Is that what you said earlier?
[03:29:46.370 --> 03:29:48.152]  Well, they can't stop it.
[03:29:48.572 --> 03:29:51.394]  They have no way in the world of doing anything about this except for nuke.
[03:29:51.755 --> 03:29:55.658]  And so they're not going to let a good crisis go to waste and they're going to use that then.
[03:29:55.678 --> 03:29:59.762]  I mean, I just want to put words in your mouth, but is that what you said last hour?
[03:30:00.495 --> 03:30:03.878]  Okay, I have been told it was intimated.
[03:30:03.898 --> 03:30:07.761]  You know how they have a way of saying, now Chaplain, you know this to be true.
[03:30:08.582 --> 03:30:17.189]  It has been intimated to me that everything that I was told a year and a half ago is to their timeline, that now they're going to use this as a method of fulfilling it.
[03:30:18.490 --> 03:30:24.555]  And if people want to know what that timeline is, they can call our toll-free number and we have six DVDs on it.
[03:30:26.834 --> 03:30:32.878]  Yeah, that's amazing, because this information dovetails, again, I keep using the word dovetails, but hooks into past info.
[03:30:33.779 --> 03:30:35.240]  Mike, anything else from New Orleans?
[03:30:37.942 --> 03:30:56.054]  Not really, Alex, other than I have asked my sources that are deep in there to go ahead, and they're going to get back to me shortly with any new information, if they have witnessed any arrests, and what for, who's doing the arresting, what charges, those kind of things.
[03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:59.251]  That's what I've asked them to check into.
[03:30:59.651 --> 03:31:09.536]  And so there's like strongmen stomping around, letting Louisianans know that they're the boss, because people keep describing them as thugs, even in other newspapers.
[03:31:10.056 --> 03:31:17.319]  I mean, so I guess they just walk up like a wrench and go, this is our area now, boy, you do what BP says.
[03:31:18.639 --> 03:31:20.940]  Don't you get up, we're flooding you with oil.
[03:31:21.001 --> 03:31:24.182]  I mean, I hate to do the Italian mobster accent, but I mean, what are they doing?
[03:31:25.913 --> 03:31:32.684]  They have got the people so intimidated down there that they're afraid to even talk among themselves.
[03:31:34.164 --> 03:31:37.225]  Strangers, you just have to, it's like pulling teeth.
[03:31:37.885 --> 03:31:43.547]  So, whatever they're doing is rough.
[03:31:43.767 --> 03:31:54.610]  Well, that's like they have an article today in the Wall Street Journal which talks about the vanity of airline passengers and it says, they don't like the body scanners or being strip searched in public.
[03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:56.471]  They're scum, basically.
[03:31:57.071 --> 03:31:58.332]  Well, everything's backwards.
[03:31:58.372 --> 03:32:01.013]  It's like, you don't like being strip-searched, now they strip-search you?
[03:32:01.414 --> 03:32:04.315]  You don't like having DNA taken without a warrant on the side of the highway?
[03:32:04.635 --> 03:32:06.617]  You're a vain piece of garbage!
[03:32:06.897 --> 03:32:09.078]  Not, you have rights, you have dignity.
[03:32:09.498 --> 03:32:11.019]  Not, you don't want to be humiliated.
[03:32:11.039 --> 03:32:13.681]  I mean, it's just, everything is like going into...
[03:32:14.767 --> 03:32:18.929]  Flux, where they're like converting us over to pure evil at every level.
[03:32:18.969 --> 03:32:20.069]  Mike, I appreciate your call.
[03:32:20.089 --> 03:32:20.890]  Stay in contact.
[03:32:20.930 --> 03:32:27.573]  You gotta remember that these communities down there are very, very small, so it's not that hard to go ahead and overtake them.
[03:32:28.308 --> 03:32:31.709]  No, no, I'm not bashing these people, I just, somebody needs to stand up for them.
[03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:39.491]  And these BP guys, though, they want to intimidate and be the boss, because they know they've done wrong at destroying these communities.
[03:32:39.971 --> 03:32:42.691]  And so it's like, you know what we say, get down there!
[03:32:43.052 --> 03:32:48.573]  You know, that way they're already dominating them, so the people never get angry and stand up against them.
[03:32:49.213 --> 03:32:51.234]  And, I mean, next they'll be calling the locals terrorists.
[03:32:51.254 --> 03:32:52.854]  You don't like oil all over you?
[03:32:53.254 --> 03:32:54.314]  You're a terrorist!
[03:32:54.594 --> 03:32:57.735]  You don't like Obama banning all fishing out here even when there's no oil?
[03:32:58.055 --> 03:32:59.016]  You're a terrorist!
[03:32:59.896 --> 03:33:01.056]  You don't like giving your rights up?
[03:33:01.136 --> 03:33:02.096]  You're a terrorist!
[03:33:02.156 --> 03:33:06.718]  And it might be, I mean literally, it's like Homeland Security dealing with evil terrorists in Louisiana.
[03:33:07.118 --> 03:33:08.638]  Maybe they caused the oil spill.
[03:33:09.198 --> 03:33:10.219]  Maybe it's their fault.
[03:33:10.459 --> 03:33:11.599]  Maybe they're with Al Qaeda.
[03:33:12.079 --> 03:33:14.160]  Well, maybe Bin Laden's hiding in New Orleans.
[03:33:14.220 --> 03:33:15.901]  Maybe tactical nukes are needed there.
[03:33:15.921 --> 03:33:19.263]  I mean, I'm being sarcastic, but that's the absurdistness of it.
[03:33:19.883 --> 03:33:22.045]  Let's talk to John in Louisiana.
[03:33:22.065 --> 03:33:22.905]  A lot of calls from there.
[03:33:23.205 --> 03:33:23.886]  John, you're on the air.
[03:33:23.926 --> 03:33:24.546]  Thanks for holding.
[03:33:25.807 --> 03:33:26.587]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:33:26.987 --> 03:33:27.387]  Good, sir.
[03:33:28.548 --> 03:33:37.633]  I went out there as media, and they had a little media show for us because, you know, that's how they operate.
[03:33:38.193 --> 03:33:40.775]  Of course, you know, they were laying the boons and stuff like that.
[03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:43.432]  In the media, um, op.
[03:33:44.593 --> 03:33:47.215]  But you can look down the beach and there's no cleaning crews.
[03:33:47.896 --> 03:33:50.558]  None of that.
[03:33:50.979 --> 03:33:53.962]  The, uh, the military is over there and they're acting really suspicious.
[03:33:54.642 --> 03:33:55.463]  They don't talk.
[03:33:56.624 --> 03:33:59.367]  They're always, like, watching you, always looking at their feet.
[03:34:00.336 --> 03:34:01.937]  Well, they don't talk to slaves.
[03:34:02.477 --> 03:34:03.878]  You're just there to pay taxes.
[03:34:03.918 --> 03:34:07.640]  You're nothing but a blood bag to feed the New World Order.
[03:34:08.341 --> 03:34:17.886]  Now, specifically, yeah, they're having some photo ops, and so you were brought down to be shown a photo op, but then you noticed it was just a photo op.
[03:34:19.087 --> 03:34:20.528]  Yeah, I mean, you can tell.
[03:34:20.668 --> 03:34:26.792]  I'm sure the mainstream media that was also there with us knew it was a photo op, but, you know, they don't care.
[03:34:26.812 --> 03:34:28.633]  Most of them don't.
[03:34:29.926 --> 03:34:33.207]  Well, how much oil did you see in the surrounding areas there in Louisiana?
[03:34:34.068 --> 03:34:35.208]  Oh, man.
[03:34:35.828 --> 03:34:44.872]  There's, like, rocks on the, like, about 200 yards off the shore, and they're black.
[03:34:46.012 --> 03:34:50.654]  And it looks like orange, brownish looking thing.
[03:34:50.714 --> 03:34:52.115]  It's really nasty looking.
[03:34:52.135 --> 03:34:56.317]  You can tell it's definitely really, really bad.
[03:34:56.957 --> 03:34:59.558]  There's oil all along the beaches, and there's no cleanup crews.
[03:35:00.433 --> 03:35:04.802]  And, uh, when they showed the most clean-up crews is when the media was shooting their cameras.
[03:35:07.777 --> 03:35:26.664]  What about these reports that I've seen confirmed in the news where foreign governments like the Dutch are refused, even though they have ships in the area, the military is not allowed to help, that the military will demand that we've got to count these booms over and over again for five, six days, and then they say now we're not going to allow you to put the booms out.
[03:35:26.944 --> 03:35:28.105]  I mean, that's confirmed.
[03:35:28.425 --> 03:35:30.886]  Why does the military go along with those orders, Lindsey Williams?
[03:35:35.227 --> 03:35:36.768]  I can't believe, Alex, that
[03:35:37.934 --> 03:35:43.737]  You know, Alex, I'm like you.
[03:35:43.757 --> 03:35:46.178]  I believe in telling the truth regardless.
[03:35:46.939 --> 03:35:49.700]  And I was taught that from a child and I still do it today.
[03:35:50.121 --> 03:35:54.743]  I guess there's so many people in the country that are intimidated by their higher-ups.
[03:35:55.103 --> 03:35:58.265]  They've been brainwashed into believing that they ought to go along with everything.
[03:35:58.285 --> 03:36:04.308]  And that's the only thing I can think of that would cause them to do such things, is realizing that people's lives are at stake.
[03:36:06.673 --> 03:36:07.353]  It's just horrible.
[03:36:07.393 --> 03:36:08.134]  Two final calls.
[03:36:08.174 --> 03:36:11.695]  We'll let Lindsey go and go back into retransmission.
[03:36:12.136 --> 03:36:15.737]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Louisiana, then Gary.
[03:36:15.757 --> 03:36:16.578]  John, thanks for holding.
[03:36:19.479 --> 03:36:19.739]  Hello?
[03:36:20.860 --> 03:36:21.720]  Yeah, John, go ahead.
[03:36:21.740 --> 03:36:25.222]  Oh, I was up still on.
[03:36:27.183 --> 03:36:28.824]  Oh yeah, by the way,
[03:36:31.019 --> 03:36:31.479]  That's all.
[03:36:31.679 --> 03:36:32.059]  That's all.
[03:36:32.439 --> 03:36:32.760]  You know what?
[03:36:32.780 --> 03:36:36.580]  They didn't disconnect your call when I said thanks for the call, so I thought it was another John from Louisiana.
[03:36:36.600 --> 03:36:37.281]  I apologize.
[03:36:37.301 --> 03:36:38.861]  Or I never let you go.
[03:36:38.921 --> 03:36:40.541]  Let's go to Gary in New Orleans.
[03:36:40.581 --> 03:36:41.362]  Gary, you're on the air.
[03:36:41.402 --> 03:36:41.802]  Go ahead.
[03:36:42.762 --> 03:36:43.322]  Mayday.
[03:36:43.562 --> 03:36:44.482]  Mayday, Alex.
[03:36:44.602 --> 03:36:47.623]  If we ever needed your bullhorn, we need it now down here.
[03:36:47.743 --> 03:36:48.764]  I recognize Gary.
[03:36:48.804 --> 03:36:49.484]  I know your voice.
[03:36:49.504 --> 03:36:51.104]  You're a talk show host down in New Orleans.
[03:36:51.924 --> 03:36:52.444]  Yes, sir.
[03:36:52.524 --> 03:36:58.606]  Yeah, I had to take action a couple years ago when you said to quit calling Alex Jones to do it and get out there and do it yourself.
[03:36:59.349 --> 03:37:06.038]  So I've been down on the island and pretty much what's happening, there are no armed troops as of yet.
[03:37:06.518 --> 03:37:15.510]  Now there is a report from the Washington AP that the State Departments are considering assistance from 13 countries.
[03:37:18.367 --> 03:37:26.831]  State Department Crowley is stating that there's going to be German, France, Britain, and also the U.N.
[03:37:26.931 --> 03:37:28.091]  environmental program.
[03:37:28.131 --> 03:37:31.232]  So if you've seen the report from Iron Mountain, that might tell you a little bit.
[03:37:31.613 --> 03:37:32.773]  Oh no, give me that headline.
[03:37:32.833 --> 03:37:33.693]  This is big news.
[03:37:33.754 --> 03:37:36.495]  What's the headline on the troops from 13 countries?
[03:37:38.175 --> 03:37:40.376]  Well, 13 nations and U.N.
[03:37:40.476 --> 03:37:41.537]  offering help, U.S.
[03:37:41.637 --> 03:37:42.057]  says.
[03:37:43.257 --> 03:37:46.879]  And it's four paragraphs, if you want me to read it real quick.
[03:37:47.378 --> 03:37:48.519]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:37:48.539 --> 03:37:57.825]  Alright, the State Department says officials are considering offers of assistance from 13 countries and the United Nations to help in the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:37:58.485 --> 03:37:58.825]  U.S.
[03:37:58.885 --> 03:38:04.749]  neighbors Canada and Mexico are among those offering equipment and experts in containing the cleanup and the leak.
[03:38:05.552 --> 03:38:05.913]  Of course.
[03:38:23.736 --> 03:38:31.264]  France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the UN Environmental Program.
[03:38:39.412 --> 03:38:43.915]  It'd be one thing if early on you have Dutch ships in the area with the booms.
[03:38:43.935 --> 03:38:45.055]  They say, hey, let us help you.
[03:38:45.096 --> 03:38:45.436]  Let them.
[03:38:45.836 --> 03:38:47.877]  But it's another thing to wait 40 plus days.
[03:38:48.117 --> 03:38:49.298]  Not let the states.
[03:38:49.518 --> 03:38:51.379]  They're not letting Jindal.
[03:38:51.740 --> 03:38:53.541]  They're not letting the Louisiana governor.
[03:38:53.581 --> 03:38:55.282]  They're not letting the Mississippi governor.
[03:38:55.302 --> 03:38:56.923]  They're not letting Florida.
[03:38:57.984 --> 03:38:58.524]  Go in.
[03:38:58.965 --> 03:39:03.308]  Well, how can the feds tell the states what they can and can't do?
[03:39:03.428 --> 03:39:11.234]  I mean, this is a 9th and 10th Amendment issue, a states' rights issue, but the State Department is looking, and I appreciate your call here with the info,
[03:39:13.716 --> 03:39:15.317]  At sending the U.N.
[03:39:15.337 --> 03:39:26.803]  in, which will then be photo ops, just like New Orleans, they wouldn't let the troops or the National Guard or the Walmart or the Coast Guard help people.
[03:39:27.363 --> 03:39:33.407]  All they would do is send in federal troops to confiscate guns in high and dry areas as a gun confiscation drill, basically.
[03:39:34.335 --> 03:39:41.959]  And then Mexican troops were brought in to Texas and Mississippi, Louisiana, as support role.
[03:39:42.279 --> 03:39:45.280]  So the message is only foreign troops can help you.
[03:39:45.580 --> 03:39:46.621]  The states can't.
[03:39:46.901 --> 03:39:48.222]  The states can't be trusted.
[03:39:48.542 --> 03:39:50.042]  But foreign governments can.
[03:39:51.403 --> 03:39:58.446]  As a Louisianan, you know, in the middle of all this, after Katrina, I mean, do you concur with what I just said?
[03:39:58.466 --> 03:40:00.227]  Or do you have any other facets you want to add to that?
[03:40:00.267 --> 03:40:01.648]  Or do you disagree?
[03:40:03.683 --> 03:40:04.584]  He's gone, okay.
[03:40:06.145 --> 03:40:08.306]  I guess the code word to let people go is thanks for the call.
[03:40:08.366 --> 03:40:11.768]  I meant, I did say thanks for the call, but I meant thanks for calling with this article.
[03:40:12.769 --> 03:40:14.790]  Call me back tomorrow, because I've met that fella.
[03:40:14.810 --> 03:40:18.553]  He's a good talk show host down in New Orleans, and I want to get his full breakdown on all this.
[03:40:19.073 --> 03:40:20.594]  That's a good place to close it out.
[03:40:20.614 --> 03:40:30.501]  This looks like they're going to turn it into a huge United Nations love fest, you know, where oh, thank God the UN came, and I bet the UN even comes up with the idea of how to fix the leak.
[03:40:31.962 --> 03:40:33.363]  What do you think, Lindsey Williams?
[03:40:34.283 --> 03:40:35.684]  Anything could happen at this point.
[03:40:35.944 --> 03:40:38.364]  I think it is anybody's guess what might take place.
[03:40:38.964 --> 03:40:45.506]  There's one thing for sure, regardless of what happens, the elite are going to profit from what has happened.
[03:40:46.947 --> 03:40:47.387]  Amazing.
[03:40:47.447 --> 03:40:51.268]  Lindsey, I'm going to definitely talk to you again next week as this unfolds.
[03:40:51.348 --> 03:40:54.649]  God bless you and thanks for breaking your inside scoop here on the air with us.
[03:40:54.909 --> 03:40:55.669]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:40:56.513 --> 03:40:58.073]  Thank you, Alex, and have a wonderful day.
[03:40:58.133 --> 03:41:01.134]  I appreciate the privilege of being on your show today.
[03:41:01.274 --> 03:41:02.715]  Oh, it's a privilege to have you on.
[03:41:02.775 --> 03:41:03.375]  God bless you.
[03:41:03.495 --> 03:41:07.256]  And I don't really like to do more than four hours because I get a bit dingy.
[03:41:07.736 --> 03:41:10.137]  It's easy to talk on the first, second, third, fourth hour.
[03:41:10.177 --> 03:41:13.138]  But after that, I get a little bit punch drunk here on air.
[03:41:13.198 --> 03:41:16.018]  But I'll be recharged and back live 11 a.m.
[03:41:16.078 --> 03:41:20.700]  Central, 12 noon Eastern tomorrow and back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:23.560]  But just so much crazy news.
[03:41:23.580 --> 03:41:24.661]  We'll continue to cover it all.
[03:41:25.821 --> 03:41:34.543]  Coming up in future transmissions and at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:41:34.563 --> 03:41:36.583]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[03:41:36.603 --> 03:41:44.425]  I want to say great job to all the webmasters, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemosti, Watson, Aaron Dykes, all the people here in this office.
[03:41:45.045 --> 03:41:46.105]  They're doing a wonderful job.
[03:41:46.185 --> 03:41:49.186]  Phil and Matt Ryan and Matt.
[03:41:50.206 --> 03:41:54.350]  Uh, and of course, uh, Jaron, and just, uh, Craig, everybody else.
[03:41:54.390 --> 03:41:55.952]  The entire office has done a great job.
[03:41:56.032 --> 03:41:57.814]  Our listeners, our sponsors, our affiliates.
[03:41:58.455 --> 03:42:05.482]  And for all of you putting up with me, until next time, Lord willing, we'll see you back here, uh, live, coming up in about 19 hours.
[03:42:05.802 --> 03:42:06.483]  Vaya con Dios.
[03:42:44.745 --> 03:42:46.666]  Oh yeah, victorious!
[03:42:46.826 --> 03:42:47.146]  Ha ha!
