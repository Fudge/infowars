[00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:04.294]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:04.314 --> 00:00:08.256]  This is Jason Burmas sitting in for Alex Jones, who's on assignment.
[00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:15.359]  And before we go back to your calls, I want to hit up Climategate for a moment.
[00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:20.621]  Now, Tuesday, snowstorm shatters local records.
[00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.910]  We're seeing this in places like Chicago.
[00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.110]  We've got the headline over here.
[00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.211]  Washington, D.C., record levels.
[00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:32.512]  Baltimore, Maryland, record levels.
[00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:35.052]  And what does the mainstream media say?
[00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:37.833]  Well, they say it's because of global warming.
[00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:40.073]  See, they have their cake and eat it too.
[00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.274]  If there was no snow, it's global warming.
[00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:46.335]  If we have too much snow, it's global warming.
[00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.354]  But they don't even use the term global warming anymore.
[00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:52.895]  They say climate change, so it can be all-encompassing.
[00:00:54.196 --> 00:01:00.839]  Doesn't matter that China has internal documents saying that, well, this is really about a consolidation of power and world government.
[00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.260]  And I'm no fan of the Chinese or their policies.
[00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.401]  But let's look at these other headlines.
[00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.602]  And again, these are all out of the UK.
[00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:10.343]  Mainline publications.
[00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:12.604]  This is Saturday's Globe and Mail.
[00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:20.047]  The great global warming collapse, as science scandals keep coming, the air has gone out of the climate change movement.
[00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:22.188]  Of course it has!
[00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:41.616]  Because the IPCC is a UN organization hell-bent on global governance, and really a one-world order, a new world order, with the elitists at the top, with the bankers in control, and us as the serfs and slaves.
[00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:42.917]  It has nothing to do
[00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:59.608]  With saving the planet and everything to do with taxing you to death and controlling your lives from the inside out, saying how much energy you can use, what kind of home you can live in, how many cars you can have, how many children you will be allowed.
[00:02:00.148 --> 00:02:04.370]  Also coming up in Invisible Empire, Ted Turner talking about one and two child policies in this country.
[00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.691]  He calls them voluntary.
[00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:11.133]  Folks, there's no such thing as a voluntary one-child policy.
[00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:12.709]  Okay?
[00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.670]  Doesn't exist.
[00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.231]  It's like black sunshine.
[00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:16.011]  Doesn't happen.
[00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:16.911]  Okay?
[00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:17.912]  Just doesn't happen.
[00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:21.754]  Climate Change Research Bungle.
[00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:29.618]  The research institute run by the head of the UN's climate body has handed out a series of environmental awards to companies that have given it financial support.
[00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.159]  That's called quid pro quo.
[00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.963]  Again, nothing to do with the climate and everything to do with empowering world government and kickbacks.
[00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:48.330]  The Energy and Resources Institute, of which Dr. Rajendra Pachauri is the Director General, has given corporate awards to companies such as Pepsi and Honda.
[00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.611]  Oh yes, Pepsi and Honda are so green.
[00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:52.972]  As well as Indian businesses.
[00:02:53.572 --> 00:03:00.074]  Those same companies have given financial backing to Terry through grants or paid for consultancy work.
[00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.075]  Oh, we'll hire him as a consultant.
[00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.100]  For a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.340]  That would never sway his opinion.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.361]  No, no, no.
[00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:12.182]  New errors in IPCC climate change report.
[00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:22.725]  The United Nations Panel on Climate Change is facing fresh criticism today as the Sunday Telegraph reveals new factual errors and poor sources of evidence in its influential report to government leaders.
[00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:26.266]  This was the end-all be-all report, I believe, back in 2007.
[00:03:29.082 --> 00:03:30.303]  And let's just go through the list.
[00:03:30.683 --> 00:03:31.323]  The top list.
[00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:33.364]  This is what the mainstream media is telling you.
[00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:35.926]  The corporate controlled press is admitting this.
[00:03:38.687 --> 00:03:47.792]  It contained the publication of inaccurate data on the potential of wave power to produce electricity around the world, which was wrongly attributed to the website of commercial wave energy company.
[00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:51.394]  Claims based on information in press releases and newsletters.
[00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:55.216]  New examples of statements based on student dissertations.
[00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:57.757]  Two of which were unpublished.
[00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:00.075]  Did you hear that?
[00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:02.758]  Student dissertations that were unpublished!
[00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.724]  More claims which were based on reports produced by environmental pressure groups.
[00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:13.432]  They are the latest in a series of damaging revelations about the IPCC's most recent report published in 2007.
[00:04:15.632 --> 00:04:23.280]  Last month the panel was forced to issue a humiliating retraction after it emerged statements about the melting of Himalayan glaciers were inaccurate.
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.708]  They used some, you know, kid who was a mountain climber in his 20s saying that he took pictures and it looked like the glaciers were melting.
[00:04:32.408 --> 00:04:34.791]  No scientific evidence whatsoever!
[00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:35.912]  Zero!
[00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:38.715]  Zero point zero evidence!
[00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:42.127]  And then I gotta end it on this note.
[00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:46.471]  I thought of killing myself, says Climate Scandal Professor Bill Jones.
[00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:50.394]  And Bill Jones is featured, again, in my upcoming film, Invisible Empire.
[00:04:51.474 --> 00:04:56.458]  And this guy said, boy, when this happened, I just felt so bad I almost killed myself.
[00:04:56.498 --> 00:05:03.304]  And what's really disgusting about the article is that they relate his experience to Dr. David Kelly.
[00:05:04.124 --> 00:05:06.426]  Saying that Dr. David Kelly killed himself.
[00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:07.347]  He was murdered.
[00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.468]  MURDERED!
[00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:19.990]  They're saying he killed himself after he came out publicly and said that the Defense Department out in the UK had sexed up intelligence about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.
[00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.072]  All of a sudden you find him in the woods with his wrist cut!
[00:05:23.193 --> 00:05:26.035]  And they're trying to say that that's a suicide, and it's in relation.
[00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:28.857]  No, they killed this guy for telling the truth!
[00:05:30.258 --> 00:05:31.539]  The inquests have shown it!
[00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:32.840]  The cover-ups have shown it!
[00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:36.859]  But now Phil Jones, oh, I just, I couldn't deal with it.
[00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.660]  Now he won't admit that he was wrong or that he was lying.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.380]  He's just upset about the way the media handled it.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.781]  Read the emails, folks.
[00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:47.382]  The emails are the most damning thing you could possibly read.
[00:05:47.582 --> 00:05:48.822]  Don't read the media spin.
[00:05:49.122 --> 00:05:49.822]  Read the emails.
[00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.543]  All right, let's go back to a few more callers.
[00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:54.764]  Let's go to Jim in Virginia.
[00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:55.424]  Jim, you're on the line.
[00:05:55.664 --> 00:05:57.244]  Oh, no, Jim, he hung up.
[00:05:57.284 --> 00:05:58.745]  Let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[00:05:58.785 --> 00:05:59.285]  Chris, you're on the line.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.381]  Hey Jason, thanks for taking my call.
[00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.231]  I mean, Obama is apathetic.
[00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:17.931]  What is it?
[00:06:18.071 --> 00:06:22.375]  I'm sorry, agnostic towards taxes on regular Americans.
[00:06:22.735 --> 00:06:32.222]  Before, when he was a champion of the people, there will be no new taxes, we're leaving Iraq, we're getting out of Afghanistan, we're going to come fiscally responsible, we're getting rid of lobbyists.
[00:06:32.402 --> 00:06:33.523]  None of it was true.
[00:06:33.943 --> 00:06:35.605]  Zero of it was true.
[00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:39.147]  They just continue to bail out the banks with trillions of dollars.
[00:06:39.688 --> 00:06:43.371]  They continue to pass nightmarish legislation like the GIVE Act.
[00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:54.048]  They promote Youth Corps, and they are trying to put this country under more socialization, which is just going to lead to a global government takeover.
[00:06:54.128 --> 00:06:54.629]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.750]  Yeah, and just also, you know, you're right about the 9-11 truth.
[00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:09.154]  I'm a former volunteer firefighter, and after 2002 when I woke up, I was trained in, you know, fire behavior, and then when he started talking about the steel melting, I said, wait a minute, no way, it doesn't melt at that temperature.
[00:07:09.174 --> 00:07:14.076]  And people need to realize that, you know, they've come out with so many different stories.
[00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:14.836]  I appreciate the call.
[00:07:14.876 --> 00:07:16.257]  Let's go through a few of those stories.
[00:07:17.017 --> 00:07:18.358]  First day, okay?
[00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:25.105]  Well, it just got so hot that the steel melted and then the building pancaked floor by floor by floor.
[00:07:25.185 --> 00:07:27.828]  Then you start looking at the videos and it doesn't pancake floor by floor.
[00:07:27.868 --> 00:07:36.298]  You can see huge ejections from the explosions that are taking place 20, 40, and 60 floors below the supposed quote-unquote pancake.
[00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:47.393]  So then, they come out and they spin it and they say, well, it didn't really have to be hot enough to melt the steel, it just had to weaken it, and then this domino effect happened, and the central columns gave way.
[00:07:47.593 --> 00:07:49.353]  Remember, they told you it was a hollow tube!
[00:07:49.874 --> 00:07:53.475]  Nothing could have been further from the truth, it was a huge cross-section grid!
[00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:59.997]  I mean, it's out of control, what they told you, and what really happened.
[00:08:00.557 --> 00:08:02.018]  And then, we point out,
[00:08:02.813 --> 00:08:06.515]  Well, there were temperatures of over 2,700 degrees at the base of the World Trade Center.
[00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:08.756]  Jet fuel only burns at 1,800 degrees.
[00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:11.357]  They refuse to address that point.
[00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:15.119]  When you talk about the molten metal, it doesn't exist.
[00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.040]  They don't want to talk about the molten metal.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.221]  They say this is their talking point back.
[00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:23.683]  This is what the people over at Skeptics Magazine like Tom Shermer and other scumbags say.
[00:08:24.619 --> 00:08:28.543]  They say, well, it didn't have to be that hot, you know, at 1800 degrees.
[00:08:28.763 --> 00:08:33.707]  Listen, we're not talking about when steel loses its strength.
[00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.671]  We're talking about the molten metal that was found on the site!
[00:08:38.572 --> 00:08:49.481]  And then John Gross of NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which are in charge of this Cybersecurity Act with the FCC, same organization, gets up
[00:08:50.566 --> 00:08:50.846]  In front of
[00:09:08.237 --> 00:09:09.177]  This molten metal.
[00:09:09.217 --> 00:09:10.438]  He's like, well, could you show it to me?
[00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:11.838]  Did you just see it yourself?
[00:09:12.359 --> 00:09:14.079]  He's like, well, no, but it was reported.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.700]  Oh, I don't know of any reports.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.882]  And then we play the firefighters talking about the molten metal.
[00:09:20.162 --> 00:09:26.524]  We play Ken Holden of the Federal Emergency Management Agency talking about the molten metal dripping from Building 6.
[00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:33.027]  We show you the clips where they talk about 2000 plus degree temperatures weeks after the attacks.
[00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:37.526]  But the debunkers don't want to touch it, because it's the truth!
[00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:42.987]  God forbid we act like grown-ups in this country and talk about the truth!
[00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:48.329]  The truth has become like some diseased organism of lepers that nobody wants to touch!
[00:09:49.989 --> 00:10:01.332]  Well, I'm going to embrace the truth, and I'm going to do everything in my power to change the truth of the situation from the fact that we are overrun by a tyrannical system
[00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:04.442]  Alright, let's go to Justin in Pennsylvania.
[00:10:04.462 --> 00:10:05.223]  Justin, you're online.
[00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:05.503]  Oh, wonderful.
[00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:38.103]  In regards to the internet policies they're trying to pass now, I've been working in the internet industry since the early, mid-90s, and the actual government monitoring of the internet has been going on long before that.
[00:10:39.825 --> 00:10:45.630]  Even with the passage of the Homeland Security Act, the... I'm turning the radio off.
[00:10:46.781 --> 00:10:55.403]  There are monitoring stations, for example, in New Jersey back in late 1909, they were installing a new monitoring station in the T-Mobile station.
[00:10:55.443 --> 00:11:06.646]  They call it, quote-unquote, the back room, where each of the high-speed serial links coming into the network were being tapped and brought into this back room so that everything coming into and out of the station could be monitored.
[00:11:07.057 --> 00:11:13.080]  Exactly, and what happens, people don't understand, they go, well they don't have enough personnel to listen to all my phone calls or read all my emails.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.281]  You're damn right they don't have enough personnel, thank the Lord.
[00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:25.567]  What they do have, and they've had since the late 90s publicly out in the open, these are the systems that we knew about in the 90s, they have Echelon and Carnivore software.
[00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:33.604]  So they go through, they pick out key phrases, specific places, and then they track and trace and database you from there.
[00:11:34.344 --> 00:11:45.031]  On top of that, I want to talk about something Wikileaks released about two, three months ago that's of utter importance in this massive slave state control grid.
[00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:45.912]  We'll be back after this.
[00:11:45.952 --> 00:11:46.813]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:49.674]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:55.656]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:11:56.016 --> 00:11:57.856]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:11:58.316 --> 00:11:58.736]  Don't!
[00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:02.197]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:12:02.617 --> 00:12:03.237]  Why pay?
[00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:09.738]  When you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:12:09.718 --> 00:12:11.379]  's number one debt secret.
[00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:15.399]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:18.480]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.948]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:27.289]  Herb K. was right.
[00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:30.553]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:12:30.673 --> 00:12:31.674]  What have you got to lose?
[00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:35.158]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money!
[00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:38.799]  Get Herb K's number one death secret absolutely free now!
[00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:39.399]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:40.139]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:40.199]  888-352-7726.
[00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:43.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.241]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:48.521]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:13:03.127 --> 00:13:05.689]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:11.914]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:13:12.095 --> 00:13:17.139]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:27.207]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:13:27.327 --> 00:13:29.428]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:13:29.668 --> 00:13:31.008]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:13:31.248 --> 00:13:33.529]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:35.549]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:40.611]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:45.692]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:13:52.156 --> 00:13:53.597]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:54.157]  February 11th, 2010.
[00:13:54.197 --> 00:13:55.137]  Gold open this morning at $10.79.60.
[00:13:55.177 --> 00:13:58.479]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.09.35, $5.54.68 for a half ounce, or $2.77.34 for the quarter ounce.
[00:13:58.499 --> 00:13:59.199]  That's $11.09.35, $5.54.68, and $2.77.34.
[00:14:11.946 --> 00:14:22.270]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.531]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:28.933]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.774]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:14:31.974 --> 00:14:34.695]  Minus has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:14:34.755 --> 00:14:35.155]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:39.876]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:40.716]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:46.518]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:46.538 --> 00:14:46.738]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:14:46.758 --> 00:14:48.218]  Money talks, and it sounds just like Jim Cramer.
[00:14:48.258 --> 00:14:48.498]  I'm Cramer.
[00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:49.179]  Money talks.
[00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:01.685]  And sometimes it shouts when the results speak for themselves.
[00:15:02.045 --> 00:15:08.592]  Investors worldwide follow Jim Cramer's advice on TV, in books, and on websites like thestreet.com.

[00:16:03.584 --> 00:16:05.065]  We are back live.
[00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:07.327]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:09.529]  I am Jason Burma sitting in while Alex is on a sign.
[00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:15.153]  We're about to have Richard Reeves in studio in the next segment for the final 90 minutes of the program.
[00:16:15.193 --> 00:16:15.654]  If you missed
[00:16:16.414 --> 00:16:17.515]  Any of the broadcasts.
[00:16:17.575 --> 00:16:25.641]  Remember, after the show, we put out a free, yes, free podcast where you can go to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and get it for free.
[00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:32.446]  Or, you can download the free iPhone app and listen to it how you want, when you want, 24-7, 365.
[00:16:33.307 --> 00:16:35.148]  It is the coolest new thing.
[00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:36.570]  I have it on my iPhone.
[00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.272]  I don't have my iPhone on me, or I'd show it to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:45.576]  Viewers, maybe we'll do that in the upcoming segment, but I just love seeing the Infowar expand.
[00:16:46.553 --> 00:16:53.400]  You know, we were number 9 out of the top 10 hottest stories on Alexa this week.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.721]  How awesome is that?
[00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:59.866]  And then you go to our Alexa ratings and we are just jumping leaps and bounds.
[00:17:00.546 --> 00:17:01.447]  Leaps and bounds.
[00:17:01.467 --> 00:17:06.232]  I went to our US rating this week and we are in the top 1,000 sites.
[00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:09.114]  We're like 900 and something in the United States of America.
[00:17:09.134 --> 00:17:09.675]  3,000 overall.
[00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:20.514]  It's amazing, and it's a testament to what we can do as a people when we get over our fear, and we turn that fear into activism.
[00:17:21.535 --> 00:17:25.917]  Into proactively attacking the system that is trying to destroy us.
[00:17:26.817 --> 00:17:28.318]  Alright, let's take a couple more callers.
[00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:30.299]  Let's go to Justin in Oklahoma.
[00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:31.059]  Justin, you're online.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:33.700]  Yes, sir.
[00:17:34.961 --> 00:17:35.541]  Hi, yeah.
[00:17:35.982 --> 00:17:40.424]  My sources are a little low to look up some of this stuff, but I have a few questions.
[00:17:41.815 --> 00:17:53.782]  One of them would be something I heard on TV about, um, in Afghanistan, how we were doing everything to make their lives better, and, like, uh, supposedly our government allowed rape.
[00:17:55.086 --> 00:17:55.727]  Supposedly.
[00:17:55.767 --> 00:17:59.349]  Let me stop you because you are just like going through this so slow.
[00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:03.412]  First of all, we're not in Afghanistan to help anybody but ourselves.
[00:18:03.672 --> 00:18:20.363]  We put in our dictator, Hamid Karzai, a Chevron executive and we allow, we don't allow, we fund his brother, the lead opium dealer in Afghanistan for the last eight years covertly through the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:18:20.663 --> 00:18:21.884]  That's the Bush administration.
[00:18:22.264 --> 00:18:23.745]  That's the Obama administration.
[00:18:23.985 --> 00:18:24.466]  Point one.
[00:18:25.206 --> 00:18:29.808]  Point two, right now, as we speak, NATO and U.S.
[00:18:29.868 --> 00:18:31.688]  forces, NATO, U.N.
[00:18:31.748 --> 00:18:41.932]  forces, again, it's about globalism, it's about internationalism, are digging in for a huge offensive on quote-unquote Taliban fighters.
[00:18:43.843 --> 00:18:45.424]  It's a dog and pony show.
[00:18:45.864 --> 00:18:48.746]  We could have been in and out of that country in two, three months.
[00:18:48.966 --> 00:18:50.186]  That's not what we wanted.
[00:18:50.487 --> 00:18:56.350]  We want that country to build the infrastructure of a Eurasian Union under our control.
[00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:03.794]  A conglomerate of Iraq, which we've taken over, of Afghanistan, which we've taken over, of Saudi Arabia, which we've worked with.
[00:19:04.494 --> 00:19:12.832]  For really decades now, we want Iran, we're beating the drums against Yemen, and we're looking to take over that region.
[00:19:13.053 --> 00:19:14.917]  As far as the rape goes, my friend...
[00:19:16.033 --> 00:19:18.095]  That was out in 2004.
[00:19:18.175 --> 00:19:20.336]  Let me say that again.
[00:19:20.877 --> 00:19:20.336]  2004.
[00:19:21.337 --> 00:19:30.804]  Senators came out of hearings not just looking at the Guantanamo Bay pictures that we've seen, but seeing some of the actual rape videos.
[00:19:30.844 --> 00:19:35.107]  They videotaped some of these rapes and killings and they were disgusted.
[00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.628]  So there is no question
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.763]  The United States military personnel are over there torturing and raping people.
[00:19:42.823 --> 00:19:47.166]  Yes, that is the uncomfortable truth that most people don't want to address.
[00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:47.767]  Go ahead, Justin.
[00:19:48.147 --> 00:19:55.212]  The bill that was passed, not about our own doing it, but the fact that a bill passed allowing rape to be illegal.
[00:19:55.813 --> 00:20:02.377]  A male can deny his wife of food for three days and if there is a rape, you can try her
[00:20:04.362 --> 00:20:09.086]  What are you talking about?
[00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:10.027]  Islamic law?
[00:20:10.147 --> 00:20:26.899]  Justin, I'm not sure what you're... If you're discussing, you know, laws from other countries, you know, some of these things are chauvinistic, they are in favor of male dominance, but I can assure you there are no laws to be passed by the United States government, or even internationally, where rape is okay.
[00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:28.020]  I can promise you that.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.360]  Rape?
[00:20:28.801 --> 00:20:29.361]  Not okay.
[00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:30.282]  Appreciate the call.
[00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.563]  Let's go to Michael in California.
[00:20:32.583 --> 00:20:33.224]  Michael, you're on the line.
[00:20:34.648 --> 00:20:36.689]  Hey Jason, good morning or afternoon.
[00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:54.482]  Something that I came across on Channel 2, Fox Network Channel 2 in San Francisco, is that in April, the city and county has decided that they will send out the first carbon tax bills in the country.
[00:20:55.302 --> 00:21:00.346]  Now the interesting point about this is that the UN was created in San Francisco.
[00:21:01.252 --> 00:21:15.658]  Uh, but they have announced that come April, you, all businesses, and this is only businesses, not people, but all businesses in the city and county of San Francisco will be receiving their first carbon tax bill of the year.
[00:21:15.978 --> 00:21:19.600]  Well, they couldn't, let me tell you something, they couldn't get it in on the federal level.
[00:21:20.748 --> 00:21:24.469]  And they couldn't get it in on the international level with the Copenhagen Climate Conference.
[00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:25.129]  So what are they going to do?
[00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:29.249]  They're going to bring it to the local level first and see which suckers pay into it.
[00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.130]  We'll be back after this with Richard Reeves.
[00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.090]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.330]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.311]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:42.832 --> 00:21:43.732]  We're on the march.
[00:21:44.232 --> 00:21:45.832]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:49.453]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:51.923 --> 00:21:56.166]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:21:56.466 --> 00:21:57.086]  Number one.
[00:21:57.387 --> 00:22:00.529]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:00.809 --> 00:22:01.389]  Number two.
[00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:06.232]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:06.552 --> 00:22:07.013]  It's true.
[00:22:07.313 --> 00:22:11.856]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:12.176 --> 00:22:12.716]  Number 3.
[00:22:12.997 --> 00:22:16.279]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:20.322]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:20.502 --> 00:22:21.042]  Number 4.
[00:22:21.282 --> 00:22:23.664]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:24.064 --> 00:22:27.446]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:27.727 --> 00:22:27.947]  Number 5.
[00:22:28.507 --> 00:22:32.430]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:37.435]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:41.739]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:41.899 --> 00:22:43.460]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.284]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:57.202]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:57.522 --> 00:23:05.663]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:23:06.383 --> 00:23:10.424]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:23:11.004 --> 00:23:21.826]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:23:22.466 --> 00:23:31.470]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:31.971 --> 00:23:37.033]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:23:37.413 --> 00:23:44.596]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:44.897 --> 00:23:47.318]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:23:52.771 --> 00:23:56.415]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:23:56.775 --> 00:23:59.799]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:04.824]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:24:04.844 --> 00:24:11.091]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:24:11.231 --> 00:24:13.474]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:24:13.954 --> 00:24:14.274]  Tim Geithner?
[00:24:14.294 --> 00:24:14.714]  Bernanke?
[00:24:14.795 --> 00:24:15.415]  They're arsonists!
[00:24:15.475 --> 00:24:16.756]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:24:16.776 --> 00:24:18.997]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:34.565]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:24:34.645 --> 00:24:35.566]  No matter how hard you try,
[00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:17.234]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:17.294 --> 00:25:20.816]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in for Alex as he is on assignment.
[00:25:20.836 --> 00:25:25.819]  We are joined now by Richard Reeves, a local activist and host of Frontline Texas.
[00:25:25.879 --> 00:25:26.680]  Richard, how are you today?
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.301]  Hey Jason, I'm doing great.
[00:25:28.521 --> 00:25:30.682]  Thank you and Alex and the crew for having me on.
[00:25:30.922 --> 00:25:32.303]  Hey, no, thank you for coming in.
[00:25:32.323 --> 00:25:39.771]  Why don't you just give a short synopsis of who you are and how you really became awakened to the Patriot movement?
[00:25:39.791 --> 00:25:41.873]  Because you've been a local activist for a long time.
[00:25:41.913 --> 00:25:44.896]  I know you've been out on trips with Alex before, with myself.
[00:25:44.936 --> 00:25:48.240]  You've been camera crew, you know, driving us around, part of the action.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.180]  That's right.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.421]  It's been a few years now.
[00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:59.987]  I first tuned into Alex in 97, but going back even further than that, I remember as a young kid in single digits of age playing dominoes in Pollyanna with my grandmother.
[00:26:00.007 --> 00:26:05.931]  And at that time, one of the best resources, ironically enough, was one of these tabloids like the Inquirer and things like that.
[00:26:05.971 --> 00:26:13.076]  At that time, that's how you got a lot of this information about the New World Order and how ultimately the plan was to take America over from within.
[00:26:13.736 --> 00:26:22.203]  And even then as a six, seven, eight year old playing these board games with my grandmother, she was telling me about that, how that we were destined to be destroyed from within.
[00:26:22.563 --> 00:26:26.025]  And so that was really my first heads up as a young boy, even back then.
[00:26:26.065 --> 00:26:27.587]  And my dad, he kind of knew what was going on.
[00:26:27.607 --> 00:26:33.971]  But you know, it wasn't until around 1992 that the puzzles started getting put together for me more.
[00:26:34.412 --> 00:26:37.494]  And that was from listening to a radio talk show host named Chuck Harder.
[00:26:37.514 --> 00:26:42.518]  I don't know if you ever heard of Chuck Harder, but he was back in 92 and he was definitely
[00:26:43.178 --> 00:26:57.250]  At that time, exposing the left-right paradigm and how that, you know, the left side's phony, the Democrats are run by these fraudsters and the bankster gangsters, and then you've got the right side run by the fraudster bankster gangsters, and he was really starting to demonstrate that back in 92.
[00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:57.831]  But then in 97,
[00:27:00.213 --> 00:27:00.353]  Yeah.
[00:27:19.569 --> 00:27:24.813]  He has that gravelly voice, so it's very hard to distinguish.
[00:27:26.695 --> 00:27:28.737]  I didn't have any idea he was that young of a man.
[00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:31.339]  I thought he was in his 30s, 40s, something like that.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.601]  36th birthday today.
[00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:35.162]  Happy birthday Alex Jones out there.
[00:27:35.182 --> 00:27:36.063]  I want to throw that out there.
[00:27:36.683 --> 00:27:37.163]  That's right.
[00:27:37.203 --> 00:27:39.445]  Happy birthday Alex, wherever you are.
[00:27:39.465 --> 00:27:40.686]  I hope you're having a good time.
[00:27:42.318 --> 00:27:58.520]  The thing that really got me in 97, listen, Alex, was that he really had the ability to articulate the New World Order and how they operate, which that's been one of the shortages that we've had for so many years, and he was able to articulate that, and he really got me on board.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.382]  He was at that time really, really bashing Bill Clinton at that time in 97.
[00:28:04.142 --> 00:28:07.163]  And of course, who did we have in the governor's mansion during that time?
[00:28:07.223 --> 00:28:08.903]  None other than George W. Bush.
[00:28:09.644 --> 00:28:16.126]  And so it was somewhere I guess in 1998 or 99 that they literally changed the format on 98.9 FM.
[00:28:16.486 --> 00:28:21.328]  It went to all Spanish radio and all of a sudden that talk radio station was gone.
[00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:28.210]  And frankly, I lost track of Alex there briefly, but when I saw 9-11, when I saw those events,
[00:28:28.751 --> 00:28:30.079]  We're good to go.
[00:28:33.089 --> 00:28:36.751]  You know, for many, many years, and at that time during 9-11, I was working night shift as well.
[00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:40.292]  But on that particular day, my phone would not quit ringing.
[00:28:40.692 --> 00:28:41.573]  It would not quit ringing.
[00:28:41.593 --> 00:28:43.313]  So I finally asked, man, I got to answer this call.
[00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:44.034]  It must be important.
[00:28:44.054 --> 00:28:46.235]  And it's none other than my mother calling me.
[00:28:46.275 --> 00:28:48.656]  I'm saying, you need to turn on the TV and see what's going on.
[00:28:49.156 --> 00:28:54.518]  And so for the rest of the day, I did basically nothing but watch the events on 9-1-1.
[00:28:55.118 --> 00:28:58.020]  And I saw Building 7 come down live on TV that day.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.321]  And from there on, I said, man, I got to find Alex Jones again.
[00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:04.146]  Because this guy, I'm sure he knows what's up.
[00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:05.107]  He knows what's going on.
[00:29:05.528 --> 00:29:11.519]  I knew that when I saw Building 7 that the official so-called story that they were feeding us was a lie.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.623]  And from there on it's like...
[00:29:14.475 --> 00:29:22.803]  Uh, as far as activism goes, it's like, how do you go back to non-activism after seeing that and realizing that the NWO is that criminal and that crazy?
[00:29:23.023 --> 00:29:32.151]  After 3,000 people are killed on live television, and I, you know, this is why I keep hearkening back to 9-11.
[00:29:32.351 --> 00:29:34.293]  I think it's very important we do so.
[00:29:34.433 --> 00:29:34.853]  And why?
[00:29:35.314 --> 00:29:36.155]  Because number one,
[00:29:36.915 --> 00:29:39.837]  It's their command and control operation.
[00:29:39.917 --> 00:29:44.940]  When they want to go into a nation, when they want to justify body scanners, what do they say?
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.580]  9-11.
[00:29:46.321 --> 00:29:46.901]  Right.
[00:29:46.921 --> 00:29:47.221]  9-11.
[00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:50.643]  We're in a post 9-11 world and this continues to this day.
[00:29:50.663 --> 00:29:51.164]  Right.
[00:29:52.051 --> 00:29:52.951]  Eight plus years later.
[00:29:53.872 --> 00:30:00.695]  And fortunately with guys like Alex Jones and you Jason and all the work that's been done is you hear less of that.
[00:30:00.795 --> 00:30:02.656]  Imagine where we would be.
[00:30:03.056 --> 00:30:08.258]  Imagine where we would be if we didn't have all these activists out there exposing 9-11 truth.
[00:30:08.798 --> 00:30:20.744]  I think we're not that far from a day when they're going to be the powers that be and the mainstream media are going to be afraid to talk about 9-11 because the overwhelming numbers of us are going to be 9-11 truthers.
[00:30:21.764 --> 00:30:39.965]  I've seen this from being to tea party events before where one of the things is see I'm a grassroots ground warfare I'm a grunt on the ground is what I am in this in this info war I'm one of the grunts on the ground I go to tea party events in San Antonio I've done a little bit of tea party events here in Austin and then I'm always going to the different
[00:30:40.325 --> 00:30:40.826]  We're good.
[00:31:00.163 --> 00:31:02.845]  Minded people, patriots, 9-11 truthers on one side.
[00:31:02.885 --> 00:31:21.419]  You picture one of those battlefield scenes where they show the camera and they show that divide that's like a grassy field between these two armed forces that are about to just head on towards each other and clash and you know they're going to be clanging of swords and spears being chunked and you know horses running over people and people getting stabbed etc.
[00:31:21.459 --> 00:31:25.402]  Crossbows being fired and that is exactly what's going on in these tea parties.
[00:31:25.542 --> 00:31:27.664]  You've got liberty and patriotic minded people
[00:31:28.144 --> 00:31:28.304]  Yeah.
[00:31:58.247 --> 00:32:03.251]  NWO exposing issues to where we literally take over all the political system.
[00:32:03.591 --> 00:32:08.875]  Left, right, Libertarian Party, we've got patriots involved in the Libertarian Party.
[00:32:09.255 --> 00:32:17.200]  I say to Libertarians, man your battle stations, keep your posts, don't let the NWO come back in and corrupt any of the parties.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:25.406]  Libertarian Party is basically run by patriots and constitutionalists and now I think what we're going to see is the Republican Party
[00:32:25.746 --> 00:32:30.067]  Become Patriot and we're starting to see people get involved in the Democrat Party.
[00:32:30.107 --> 00:32:46.050]  You can see that right here in Travis County and I know it's a national show but I want to emphasize that these little things that are happening all over the different places are just a microcosm view of the overall that's going to where 9-11 truthers, Patriots, etc.
[00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.951]  keep getting bigger and bigger and we end up being the majority.
[00:32:50.011 --> 00:33:05.121]  Well, you know, I've noticed at these events, like these Tea Party events, that even the guys that maybe don't know about 9-11 truth, that are the mainline Republicans, if you give them an Obama deception or a fall of the Republic, they are just wide awake to that.
[00:33:05.181 --> 00:33:06.262]  They can see that.
[00:33:06.662 --> 00:33:07.162]  You know what I mean?
[00:33:07.583 --> 00:33:13.086]  Obviously, you know, 9-11 isn't dealt with very much in those films, maybe briefly, you know, out of a two plus hour movie.
[00:33:13.607 --> 00:33:18.130]  But they look at that and then all of a sudden they're opened up to, hey, wait a minute, the Federal Reserve is a private system.
[00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.052]  Hey, wait a minute, the Bilderberg Group does exist.
[00:33:21.372 --> 00:33:33.080]  Hey, this isn't just Alex Jones talking about Obama standing in front of the United Nations as their Secretary General, you know, betraying the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and ultimately the people that are in this country.
[00:33:33.541 --> 00:33:35.963]  So you start them out with something like that.
[00:33:36.043 --> 00:33:42.027]  Then you give them, you know, a loose change final cut, a fabled enemies, a 9-11 truth rising,
[00:33:42.307 --> 00:33:45.028]  You know, and you can get those for great deals, and we encourage people.
[00:33:45.048 --> 00:33:48.529]  I remember the tea party I went to in San Antonio in April with Glenn Beck.
[00:33:48.949 --> 00:33:56.191]  There was a group there, I believe it was San Antonio 9-11 Truth, and they had copied over a thousand Obama deceptions.
[00:33:56.471 --> 00:33:58.952]  And I personally witnessed them handing them out to people.
[00:33:59.152 --> 00:34:05.954]  And I can't tell you how many little old ladies, you know, in their 60s and 70s grabbed it and they said, you know,
[00:34:06.394 --> 00:34:07.875]  I got sent this last week.
[00:34:08.035 --> 00:34:09.355]  I just watched it last night.
[00:34:09.395 --> 00:34:10.356]  This was unbelievable.
[00:34:10.396 --> 00:34:11.536]  Thank you for a hard copy.
[00:34:11.777 --> 00:34:12.857]  I'm going to give this to my son.
[00:34:12.877 --> 00:34:14.058]  I'm going to give this to my daughter.
[00:34:14.358 --> 00:34:21.441]  And it was so heartening to me that we can have such a big effect with what someone perceives are small movies.
[00:34:21.461 --> 00:34:23.302]  You know, we don't get a big theatrical release.
[00:34:23.702 --> 00:34:25.223]  You know, Miramax isn't backing us.
[00:34:25.643 --> 00:34:28.866]  You know, mainstream Hollywood could give a rat's ass about us.
[00:34:28.886 --> 00:34:42.700]  It's grassroots warfare at the best, and exactly what you laid out, I heard you talk about earlier in the show, that you went to San Antonio to that tea party, and so you got to witness firsthand that it is like that Braveheart movie, where you've got these two opposing forces clashing together, but the truth is going to win out.
[00:34:43.021 --> 00:34:45.263]  It's just a matter of reinforcing and getting it out there.
[00:34:45.823 --> 00:34:58.954]  And like you said, maybe with a neocon you have to start out talking about the debauched food, the GMO food, or maybe it's about Big Pharma, you know, or maybe it's about the HPV vaccine that Rick Perry wanted to ram down everybody's throats, or maybe it's about the fluoride in the water.
[00:34:59.214 --> 00:35:04.138]  But sooner or later, somebody's got an issue that you can touch them on and it's touching their life.
[00:35:04.178 --> 00:35:05.459]  Maybe they've got an autistic kid.
[00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:07.100]  Who knows what the issue is?
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.702]  You can talk about public schools and how
[00:35:09.122 --> 00:35:14.245]  The continuing dumbing down of America just happens over and over and gets worse every year.
[00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:16.847]  So there's some way to approach everybody.
[00:35:17.347 --> 00:35:24.972]  And maybe 9-11 Truth for some people is kind of the end of the road where they finally get to, but they will get to it or they'll have to deny it.
[00:35:25.452 --> 00:35:30.115]  And for those that would deny it, then I think they're in a heap of trouble because they're going there.
[00:35:30.535 --> 00:35:35.458]  I've seen it happen at these Tea Party events where you've got one guy that he's not he's not a 9-11 Truth-er.
[00:35:35.798 --> 00:35:38.520]  Well, as he's walking around the room, he's meeting different people or whatever.
[00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:40.723]  He's running the 9-11 truthers.
[00:35:40.883 --> 00:35:41.043]  Yeah.
[00:35:41.183 --> 00:35:47.851]  So it was like one of these movies like you that you see these one of these zombie movies where every time you go around the corner you run into another zombie.
[00:35:47.871 --> 00:35:59.824]  Well it's another 9-11 truther and so that's what we're gonna get to is we just need to be so ubiquitous so ubiquitous on around every corner that there's no denying it and that in 2012
[00:36:01.491 --> 00:36:14.738]  I personally think, I really believe that we are going to field a presidential candidate, I don't know if it's going to be Ron Paul, could be Ron Paul, I don't know who it is, but this time there's not going to be any pussyfooting around with 9-11 Truth.
[00:36:14.798 --> 00:36:30.986]  It's going to be front and center, it's going to be on the agenda, and what we need to do to get there is get everybody to precinct conventions, both sides of the aisle, Democrat, Republican, precinct conventions, 9-11 Truthers, infiltrate all of these groups, and get back our republic that way, and then when we go to these conventions,
[00:36:31.386 --> 00:36:35.888]  Then we're there and we're ready to select presidential candidates of our own choosing.
[00:36:36.008 --> 00:36:39.249]  Yeah, and not let the bankers just select who they want.
[00:36:39.469 --> 00:36:42.511]  And I always tell people, you know, you catch more flies with honey.
[00:36:42.551 --> 00:36:50.954]  So when you're talking to somebody that you know already has some kind of a different opposing political belief, try to bring them in with something you can agree on.
[00:36:51.274 --> 00:36:55.016]  You know, like you said, the right is more apt to know about the climate gate issue.
[00:36:55.236 --> 00:36:57.239]  You know, talk about the Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:05.252]  You know, talk about the emails and work your way into other aspects of the military-industrial complex.
[00:37:05.332 --> 00:37:10.019]  And now, in Texas, it really does look like we have a shot.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.725]  A governor who actually believes, I mean get this folks, in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:37:17.085 --> 00:37:17.205]  Oh.
[00:37:17.586 --> 00:37:17.946]  My.
[00:37:18.446 --> 00:37:18.847]  God.
[00:37:19.107 --> 00:37:20.028]  Tell us about Debra Medina.
[00:37:20.048 --> 00:37:21.649]  I'll tell you, I'm so happy to tell you about that.
[00:37:21.669 --> 00:37:22.570]  I'm glad you asked, Jason.
[00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.652]  Medina4Texas.com, that's the website.
[00:37:25.692 --> 00:37:26.893]  Medina4Texas.com.
[00:37:27.234 --> 00:37:31.117]  And I gotta tell you, this latest public policy poll that came out showing her 24%
[00:37:32.658 --> 00:37:36.201]  Really, is what's got the powers that be on the attack now.
[00:37:36.241 --> 00:37:43.466]  I'm surprised they waited so long, but yes, they are on the attack, and we can look for more attacks against Edmund Medina as this campaign goes forward.
[00:37:43.766 --> 00:37:50.692]  But, you know, one thing I like to point out on my show is that we had 1.3 million voters vote independent in 2006.
[00:37:50.732 --> 00:37:51.192]  1.3 million voters.
[00:37:53.994 --> 00:38:02.198]  Rick Perry only had 550,000 votes in that 2006 primary and now he's looking at splitting that 550,000 vote base.
[00:38:02.678 --> 00:38:05.900]  He's looking at sharing that to some degree with Kay Bailey Hutchison.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.021]  Rick Perry may end up with numbers in the 300,000 to 400,000 vote range.
[00:38:12.483 --> 00:38:21.390]  Can we really think after all these years of Alex Jones right here in Austin, the hotbed of freedom, not just of Texas, not just of the nation, but of the world?
[00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:29.175]  Can we really not believe that we've got a million patriots in Texas that are ready to hit that black box voting button for Debra Medina?
[00:38:29.536 --> 00:38:33.979]  And I know those people out there, there's got to be a million of us ready to pull that and do that.
[00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:50.132]  And I'm encouraging people to remain organized, especially on Election Day, because we know about the fraud with Diebold, we've seen Hacking Democracy, we've read Black Box Voting by Bev Harris, and we need to keep this election as honest as possible.
[00:38:50.152 --> 00:39:00.701]  We need pollsters going after the people as they exit, because we know they've done it in the past where they'll do a 10, a 15, or sometimes an even 20-point swing
[00:39:01.081 --> 00:39:02.001]  In the other direction.
[00:39:02.281 --> 00:39:02.741]  That's right.
[00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:03.261]  That's right.
[00:39:03.302 --> 00:39:14.764]  The VoteRescue.org, VoteRescue.org, Vicki Karb's group, her and Karen Rennick, I believe, have been on Alex's show before, and they talk about this issue of black box voting, and it is a very serious issue.
[00:39:15.084 --> 00:39:21.405]  As a matter of fact, in 2002, I went to work on a campaign back in 2002 here in Travis County because of that issue.
[00:39:21.886 --> 00:39:27.567]  I said, man, you know, I hear Alex talking about black box voting, but man, I'm still having trouble with that.
[00:39:28.727 --> 00:39:38.191]  The two brothers that put the video together, I don't recall their name right off the top of my head, but they put a video together about black box voting and I thought, man, it's just still hard for me to believe.
[00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:53.076]  But I got involved in that election in 2002 here in Travis County and that made a believer out of me that yes, black box voting does exist and there are fraudulent things going on with our voting, but that's where we just, like I say, I need to emphasize that we need to be big enough and bad enough
[00:39:53.496 --> 00:40:09.922]  We need to have the numbers out there that we can man every poll and we do the polling like you're talking about the exit polls of our own and VoteRescue.org I will be surprised I'm sure that they're planning on doing something here in this election to help monitor the polls and I think we can just make it a
[00:40:10.562 --> 00:40:12.663]  And I think there's good people inside the system, too.
[00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:14.443]  Not everybody's corrupted completely.
[00:40:14.843 --> 00:40:29.006]  I think a lot of the times, if we can just nail down the vote at the precincts and know those numbers there, then we can just follow up the chain of command and try to verify the votes as they go up the chain of command when they bring them into those central locations at the county level.
[00:40:29.486 --> 00:40:30.646]  And that's another way to do it.
[00:40:30.706 --> 00:40:34.527]  But VoteRescue.org, those are the folks that are really going to be watching this.
[00:40:34.587 --> 00:40:39.408]  And I have full faith in those people, like Vicki Karp, Karen Rennick, and their organization
[00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:41.589]  Helping watch for the vote fraud.
[00:40:42.229 --> 00:40:47.011]  You know, we have to shine a light on the darkness of corruption wherever it may lie.
[00:40:47.112 --> 00:40:49.013]  So, you know, we have this election.
[00:40:49.353 --> 00:40:50.373]  It's a close election.
[00:40:50.713 --> 00:40:52.134]  Deborah Medina is edged out.
[00:40:52.194 --> 00:40:53.615]  We have to remain vigilant.
[00:40:53.755 --> 00:41:07.542]  I mean, we know in 2004, in the fixed presidential election of second and eighth cousins on both sides, second cousin on one, eighth cousin on the other, both went to Yale together, you know, two years apart, both in skull and bones.
[00:41:07.722 --> 00:41:10.083]  I was going to say, don't mention Skull and Bones.
[00:41:10.183 --> 00:41:11.263]  That doesn't exist either.
[00:41:11.363 --> 00:41:12.584]  It just doesn't exist.
[00:41:12.704 --> 00:41:15.865]  It's so secret I can't talk about it.
[00:41:16.786 --> 00:41:18.426]  And you look at that election.
[00:41:18.506 --> 00:41:20.127]  Kerry wins the election.
[00:41:20.167 --> 00:41:21.087]  Let me repeat that, folks.
[00:41:21.467 --> 00:41:23.768]  Kerry wins the election.
[00:41:23.788 --> 00:41:28.750]  In fact, in Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies, he devotes an entire chapter to 2004.
[00:41:31.592 --> 00:41:37.315]  And in 2004, in Ohio, they rigged the election, and Jesse Ventura goes into it in this book.
[00:41:37.335 --> 00:41:40.717]  You can order it over at Infowars.com right now.
[00:41:40.817 --> 00:41:43.019]  I believe we have Alex Jones on the line.
[00:41:43.439 --> 00:41:43.699]  Alex?
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.963]  Hey guys, I'm driving down the highway here listening to you on the new free iPhone.
[00:41:49.983 --> 00:42:00.130]  I'll come back over the break briefly, but I did notice last night, Googling just my own name, that they're attacking Debra Medina all over the place, including Newsweek.
[00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:12.692]  Using me, saying, oh look, the king of the 9-11 truthers, the guru of the tea parties, they use all these, the prophet of the tea parties, which is actually
[00:42:13.544 --> 00:42:14.445]  Overall, the truth, man.
[00:42:14.485 --> 00:42:16.087]  Come on, Paul, it's me.
[00:42:16.808 --> 00:42:24.275]  If you've got to pick somebody out, which I don't actually like the level of heat, scrutiny, and disinformation and going DelPro that we're getting.
[00:42:24.356 --> 00:42:27.299]  But, you know, the point is, everybody has never even gotten into that.
[00:42:27.739 --> 00:42:28.420]  And that's fine.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.643]  I've never asked her about 9-11 truth because I know she's a constitutionalist.
[00:42:32.044 --> 00:42:33.325]  We need to get her into office.
[00:42:33.745 --> 00:42:34.787]  It's a state position.
[00:42:35.695 --> 00:42:37.917]  Alex will be back right after this.
[00:42:37.997 --> 00:42:39.738]  Our economy is in great distress.
[00:42:40.038 --> 00:42:44.161]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:47.523]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[00:43:05.868 --> 00:43:07.670]  You have auto and home insurance.
[00:43:08.531 --> 00:43:10.633]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[00:43:11.734 --> 00:43:14.416]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[00:43:15.037 --> 00:43:16.899]  Because it might take years to recover.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:23.405]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[00:43:24.246 --> 00:43:30.272]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a three-acre heirloom vegetable garden
[00:43:31.084 --> 00:43:31.544]  Anywhere.
[00:43:31.564 --> 00:43:34.906]  50 heirloom varieties.
[00:43:34.926 --> 00:43:35.906]  8,000 vegetable seeds.
[00:43:36.407 --> 00:43:38.768]  Over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[00:43:39.648 --> 00:43:43.250]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:49.953]  Survivalistseeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.698]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:43:57.098 --> 00:44:00.084]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:01.748]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:02.646 --> 00:44:05.127]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:05.147 --> 00:44:11.330]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:16.553]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:16.573 --> 00:44:26.678]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:26.798 --> 00:44:28.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.501]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:30.742 --> 00:44:33.023]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:35.045]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:35.325 --> 00:44:40.130]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:45.254]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:44:52.503 --> 00:44:58.811]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:44:59.212 --> 00:45:05.319]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:11.587]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[00:45:11.927 --> 00:45:16.849]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:25.171]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:45:25.492 --> 00:45:29.573]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[00:45:30.073 --> 00:45:34.396]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:45:34.737 --> 00:45:40.300]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[00:45:58.812 --> 00:46:00.853]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:00.913 --> 00:46:02.714]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:46:02.874 --> 00:46:03.894]  Alex on the line.
[00:46:03.974 --> 00:46:05.955]  Richard Reeves in studio.
[00:46:05.995 --> 00:46:08.436]  And Alex was making the point during the break.
[00:46:08.476 --> 00:46:27.524]  No matter what happens, Medina running for the governorship is a win-win because we are shining light on the real issues and we are gearing other people up to run in big elections under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which is now a novel idea in this country, Alex.
[00:46:28.387 --> 00:46:35.372]  Well, Debra Medina is the equivalent of George Washington winning that first battle a couple years into the war in Trenton, New Jersey.
[00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:42.365]  Uh, they lost every battle, but they won that small battle, and that gave people, uh, the street decor.
[00:46:42.545 --> 00:46:45.346]  It gave them that light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:46:45.727 --> 00:46:46.647]  It really buoyed them.
[00:46:46.907 --> 00:46:52.550]  And we had a big victory at Trent two months ago in Copenhagen, but at the state level, where the real battle is.
[00:46:52.610 --> 00:47:00.335]  You look at NORTHCOM, you look at Homeland Security, you look at the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, you look at the governor's, uh, board that Obama's created.
[00:47:00.775 --> 00:47:02.356]  It's all about taking over the states.
[00:47:02.416 --> 00:47:07.439]  They recognize the number one threat is the 37 states now moving to declare sovereignty.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:13.183]  That's the session, like Perry says, demonizing the states' rights movement while posing as one of us.
[00:47:13.503 --> 00:47:16.025]  That's a true Benedict Arnold, just like Beck.
[00:47:16.225 --> 00:47:17.145]  Very sophisticated.
[00:47:17.686 --> 00:47:27.732]  But what they're doing here is, just by her gaining four or five points every week, if she had two more months, she would beat them hands down, no runoff.
[00:47:28.382 --> 00:47:38.442]  She may still win, everybody's got to act like she can win, but now people will remember to take Ron Paul, Campaign for Liberty, Patriot, Infowarrior,
[00:47:39.113 --> 00:47:39.733]  I don't know.
[00:48:01.443 --> 00:48:03.603]  It's very well-spoken, very smart, great person.
[00:48:03.623 --> 00:48:06.344]  I think you're going to see some men step forward.
[00:48:06.704 --> 00:48:08.084]  They're going to be incredibly dynamite.
[00:48:08.144 --> 00:48:09.525]  More women stepping forward.
[00:48:09.925 --> 00:48:12.205]  So again, this is another victory at Trent.
[00:48:12.625 --> 00:48:23.728]  We've already won a giant victory, but this is now international and national news, and the system is sending out their biggest guns, like Comrade Beck and the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.
[00:48:24.348 --> 00:48:28.749]  Also, the Republican Party is running three Tea Party neocons against Ron Paul.
[00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:30.730]  Your true colors are being shown.
[00:48:31.031 --> 00:48:31.851]  This is a big victory.
[00:48:31.871 --> 00:48:33.653]  I'm going to throw it back to you and Richard Graves.
[00:48:34.193 --> 00:48:35.074]  Great job, gentlemen.
[00:48:35.094 --> 00:48:35.514]  God bless you.
[00:48:36.315 --> 00:48:37.336]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:48:38.036 --> 00:48:48.285]  And coming up in the next segment, Richard, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and I want to get your take on this, I want to show the panel of the new Captain America comic book.
[00:48:48.305 --> 00:48:49.185]  I don't know if you've seen it.
[00:48:49.205 --> 00:48:50.146]  I'm holding it in my hand.
[00:48:50.446 --> 00:48:51.067]  Actually, I have seen it.
[00:48:51.087 --> 00:48:56.071]  Where they portray the Tea Party movement as racist white people.
[00:48:56.391 --> 00:48:57.953]  Now, you've been to these things.
[00:48:58.633 --> 00:48:59.694]  I see Latinos there.
[00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:01.095]  I see black people there.
[00:49:01.435 --> 00:49:02.616]  I see non-whites there.
[00:49:02.956 --> 00:49:04.977]  You know, a lot of people would say that I'm not white enough, you know?
[00:49:04.997 --> 00:49:06.738]  I mean, I'm at these things.
[00:49:07.238 --> 00:49:09.200]  This is total propaganda.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:15.844]  And it's done through what used to be, you know, an icon of American greatness.
[00:49:16.124 --> 00:49:16.864]  Captain America.
[00:49:17.144 --> 00:49:19.806]  You know, he went after Red Skull and Adolf Hitler.
[00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:22.728]  I mean, this is the comic book character that reigned in Hitler.
[00:49:23.288 --> 00:49:29.497]  And now, you know, I read this thing and we're going to put it up on the screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:33.101]  Basically, Captain America is doing a little recon.
[00:49:33.222 --> 00:49:33.862]  He's got a partner.
[00:49:33.883 --> 00:49:35.104]  The partner is African American.
[00:49:36.047 --> 00:49:43.112]  And they're looking into the crowd, signs like America, not Americans, and then ones you would never see at a tea party.
[00:49:43.152 --> 00:49:46.934]  Things like, teabag the libs before they teabag you.
[00:49:47.235 --> 00:49:53.879]  See, the teabag thing is something that the fake left has used to demonize the tea parties.
[00:49:54.219 --> 00:49:56.040]  No one's talking about teabagging.
[00:49:56.501 --> 00:50:03.365]  We believe that, you know, the Founding Fathers were onto something when they took on the British and they had their first Boston Tea Party.
[00:50:03.385 --> 00:50:04.046]  That's all this means.
[00:50:04.086 --> 00:50:05.687]  It has nothing to do with teabagging.
[00:50:06.207 --> 00:50:15.170]  Now, as the black gentleman looks into the crowd, he says, I don't exactly see any black people here, insinuating like, oh, this is some kind of a racist movement.
[00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:16.751]  So I want to get into that.
[00:50:16.831 --> 00:50:18.471]  I want to get into the mass mind control.
[00:50:18.511 --> 00:50:23.693]  I want to get into how they're going after our children in this comic book and much, much more.
[00:50:23.713 --> 00:50:24.753]  We're also going to take your calls.
[00:50:24.773 --> 00:50:25.694]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:25.734 --> 00:50:28.935]  I'm Jason Berman, sitting in, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:54.514]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:50:55.514 --> 00:50:59.958]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:04.213]  It is the final hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:52:04.253 --> 00:52:05.394]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:52:05.534 --> 00:52:09.477]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in for Alex as he's out on assignment.
[00:52:09.537 --> 00:52:11.499]  Alex has joined us throughout the program.
[00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:16.342]  We are in studio with Richard Reeves of Frontline, Texas.
[00:52:17.363 --> 00:52:20.465]  And we were just discussing, and I hope we can bring this up.
[00:52:20.505 --> 00:52:22.567]  I know that it's over on the side there.
[00:52:22.607 --> 00:52:23.688]  I want people to see this.
[00:52:24.188 --> 00:52:26.170]  The Captain America comic book.
[00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:27.231]  There it is right there.
[00:52:27.371 --> 00:52:28.572]  Stop the Socialists.
[00:52:28.632 --> 00:52:29.552]  Teabag the libs.
[00:52:30.595 --> 00:52:32.997]  The Tea Party movement really isn't about right or left.
[00:52:33.277 --> 00:52:41.883]  It's about us empowering ourselves through the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and those documents are really there to empower humanity.
[00:52:42.183 --> 00:52:45.005]  Those documents don't guarantee us anything, okay?
[00:52:45.605 --> 00:52:52.069]  God, our inherent human rights, guarantee us the rights to be free, and these documents just set it in stone.
[00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.452]  And now they're being eviscerated on every single level.
[00:52:56.492 --> 00:53:00.435]  So when I see Captain America, again, an icon, an icon, you know,
[00:53:00.735 --> 00:53:03.157]  My buddy got a Captain America tattoo this year!
[00:53:03.517 --> 00:53:06.199]  You know, I see little kids in the Captain America outfits!
[00:53:06.739 --> 00:53:16.065]  In one of the storylines, about two or three years ago, because they've had several different Captain Americas, you know, I think it was Steve Richards at first, but it's someone different.
[00:53:16.305 --> 00:53:24.551]  They actually had a storyline where all of the heroes were forced by the government, the United Nations, the actual United Nations,
[00:53:25.051 --> 00:53:25.991]  To register.
[00:53:26.091 --> 00:53:28.052]  They all had to take their masks off and register.
[00:53:28.472 --> 00:53:33.274]  And Captain America refused to take his mask off, refused to register, so he got shot through the head.
[00:53:34.234 --> 00:53:34.374]  Wow.
[00:53:34.414 --> 00:53:37.995]  Yeah, he gets sniped out and killed after a big court proceeding.
[00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.536]  So, that to me was actually kind of positive.
[00:53:40.576 --> 00:53:45.518]  It's kind of showing, hey, Captain America stood up for privacy issues, he didn't go to the man, he got shot in the head.
[00:53:45.558 --> 00:53:51.560]  But now, they're using Captain America as a vehicle to demonize the Tea Party movement.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:52.100]  What's your take?
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:54:04.846]  Well, I agree with you exactly, because traditionally that's the way they demonize the Patriot movement in general, is by calling us racist, anti-Semites, etc., like that, and or just tinfoil hat wearers, kooks.
[00:54:05.966 --> 00:54:10.628]  And those things are wearing thin, I mean, basically because they've tried this racist thing over and over.
[00:54:10.648 --> 00:54:14.530]  That's just like when you try to talk about the illegal invasion, the border issues, etc.
[00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:16.731]  They have a difficult time
[00:54:17.606 --> 00:54:33.733]  Moving that forward now with columnists, you know, the racist group or whatever, because, for example, down in San Antonio, in the Tea Party movement down there, there are plenty of Americans of Hispanic descent down there involved in that party, in the Tea Party movement itself.
[00:54:33.753 --> 00:54:40.856]  As a matter of fact, my lovely wife, Catherine, she first got introduced into the Patriot movement via Glenn Beck, of all sources.
[00:54:41.276 --> 00:54:43.997]  That got her into this, and then it was at that very
[00:54:45.023 --> 00:54:45.744]  Was it Obama deception?
[00:55:09.967 --> 00:55:34.211]  I think it was Obama deception that she first saw and that really helped wake her up and then she's a quick study gets on the web and then all of a sudden she's on board full-on and so there's an example of how Glenn Beck we leverage Glenn Beck to bring in more people into the Patriot movement so overall it's good that he can at least wake up people to certain issues it's like now basically when they talk about a globalist government wanting to come to power a new world order come to power
[00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:35.271]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:56.587]  We've got a gentleman named Apostle Claver out of Houston that he's bringing forth constitutionalists.
[00:55:56.607 --> 00:55:59.370]  He's a black gentleman out of Houston, very articulate.
[00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:05.556]  He's like an Alex Jones up there, just fiery, talking about the Constitution, talking about God-given rights.
[00:56:06.016 --> 00:56:08.960]  And so the people of color are starting to come on this movement.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:10.081]  As a matter of fact, that's part of
[00:56:10.521 --> 00:56:18.808]  What I've been working on at the grassroots level is saying, all right, look, we do need to bring in more Hispanic people, especially here in Texas.
[00:56:18.848 --> 00:56:21.150]  We've got a lot of Hispanic people here and you know what?
[00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:25.694]  Bottom line is they're conservative and they're American and if they just
[00:56:26.835 --> 00:56:34.462]  When we come back, I want to discuss some of the other great candidates that are out there.
[00:56:34.482 --> 00:56:41.028]  I see that you brought a list with you of other people that are Constitution-minded, that are behind the Bill of Rights, that are for the people.
[00:56:41.228 --> 00:56:43.450]  Remember a government for and by the people?
[00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:44.191]  Exactly.
[00:56:44.251 --> 00:56:45.632]  I can dream of it again, folks!
[00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:46.693]  We'll be back after this.
[00:56:46.713 --> 00:56:47.534]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:47.594 --> 00:56:50.957]  I am Jason Bermesen in PrisonPlanet.TV, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:52.674 --> 00:56:55.276]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:56:55.696 --> 00:57:00.639]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:57:01.019 --> 00:57:02.760]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:07.883]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:57:08.064 --> 00:57:09.024]  How much do you want?
[00:57:09.244 --> 00:57:10.005]  When do you want it?
[00:57:10.365 --> 00:57:11.966]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:57:12.266 --> 00:57:13.087]  When will you need it?
[00:57:13.327 --> 00:57:15.388]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:57:15.528 --> 00:57:16.649]  Will there be any food?
[00:57:16.869 --> 00:57:18.190]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:20.772]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:57:20.932 --> 00:57:23.474]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:57:23.654 --> 00:57:26.836]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:57:27.236 --> 00:57:30.739]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:57:31.059 --> 00:57:32.040]  How much will you need?
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:32.900]  We don't know.
[00:57:33.181 --> 00:57:34.101]  How much do you want?
[00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:35.002]  All you can get.
[00:57:35.222 --> 00:57:36.063]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:36.303 --> 00:57:39.087]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:57:42.491 --> 00:57:43.272]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:57:51.926 --> 00:57:52.906]  What's your home worth?
[00:57:53.086 --> 00:57:55.007]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:57:55.187 --> 00:57:57.928]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:57:58.228 --> 00:58:05.750]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of the tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:09.391]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:58:53.283 --> 00:58:53.763]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:58:54.083 --> 00:58:56.804]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:58:57.384 --> 00:59:02.105]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[00:59:02.665 --> 00:59:07.786]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[00:59:08.406 --> 00:59:15.488]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[00:59:16.008 --> 00:59:20.909]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[00:59:21.529 --> 00:59:28.572]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[00:59:29.352 --> 00:59:33.774]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[00:59:34.454 --> 00:59:34.734]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:34.754 --> 00:59:34.814]  800-409-5633.
[00:59:34.834 --> 00:59:35.895]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:35.915 --> 00:59:36.275]  Who am I?
[00:59:36.355 --> 00:59:37.175]  Someone who cares.
[00:59:57.091 --> 00:59:57.732]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.392 --> 00:59:59.433]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.174 --> 01:00:01.275]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.915 --> 01:00:02.736]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.496 --> 01:00:04.437]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:04.457 --> 01:00:08.721]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.241 --> 01:00:13.345]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.745 --> 01:00:14.986]  We are back!
[01:00:15.066 --> 01:00:16.728]  It's the Info Warrior with Jason Bermas.
[01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:21.311]  I'm sorry, it's the Alex Jones Show with the Info Warrior sitting in.
[01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.313]  I get so used to that, it's terrible for me.
[01:00:24.094 --> 01:00:25.215]  We were just discussing
[01:00:26.314 --> 01:00:33.657]  Some of the other candidates out there, outside of Debra Medina, obviously everybody who's listening locally, we hope that you go out, you support Medina, you get involved.
[01:00:33.677 --> 01:00:35.918]  Like I said, get involved with the exit polling, folks.
[01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:40.700]  Get involved right now with knocking on your neighbor's doors and saying, hey, have you heard about this candidate?
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.701]  Are you watching this election?
[01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:43.621]  Do you plan to vote?
[01:00:43.982 --> 01:00:46.343]  And if they don't plan to vote, that's the person to rally on.
[01:00:46.583 --> 01:00:49.304]  Say, listen, we got some real issues right now.
[01:00:49.364 --> 01:00:51.525]  You need to be voting and you need to be voting for this person.
[01:00:52.185 --> 01:00:52.766]  We're good to go!
[01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:15.110]  How you can at least talk to this person for a little bit longer.
[01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:17.952]  What you need to say to this person to get them interested.
[01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:19.893]  Not only in voting, but in your candidate.
[01:01:20.353 --> 01:01:24.736]  And again, it comes down to us becoming human beings again.
[01:01:24.996 --> 01:01:25.577]  That's right.
[01:01:25.617 --> 01:01:31.741]  You know, we're so detached from society in this text message, Twitter world.
[01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:36.724]  You know, everything's through Facebook, everything's through an IM or an email.
[01:01:37.004 --> 01:01:39.566]  We don't pick up the phone and call our parents anymore.
[01:01:39.586 --> 01:01:40.407]  We email them!
[01:01:41.267 --> 01:01:43.429]  And we don't talk to our neighbors at all anymore.
[01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:45.391]  And Jason, you bring up some great points.
[01:01:45.471 --> 01:01:52.477]  I tell you, I could address several issues that you just brought up in the commentary you just made, but we need to build basically two social networks.
[01:01:52.657 --> 01:01:58.221]  One of them is on the web, but you know, it's just like you talked about earlier in the show, the web is subject to being cut off at a moment's notice.
[01:01:58.261 --> 01:02:00.183]  You know, we know that's run through the Pentagon.
[01:02:00.203 --> 01:02:02.325]  They can flip the switches and all of a sudden no more web.
[01:02:02.725 --> 01:02:07.848]  It's going to be a hard one to get over on the American public because we're used to the freedom of the internet and the free speech that we have on it.
[01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:21.576]  But the second parallel social network that we need to build is exactly what you're talking about, is working within our precincts, in our neighborhoods, so to speak, to where we've got people on board that we know what they're thinking about.
[01:02:21.616 --> 01:02:22.877]  We know they're constitutionalists.
[01:02:22.917 --> 01:02:23.958]  We know they're patriots.
[01:02:24.078 --> 01:02:25.679]  We know they're about God-given rights.
[01:02:26.235 --> 01:02:30.717]  And get them on board and that's what I see happening out there is people are getting connected.
[01:02:31.158 --> 01:02:52.109]  We're going to build the biggest grassroots Patriot Network ever and that's what's happening because I can give you an example in an election that I was involved in in 2006 there was one lady named Susan Gary up in a town called Copeland, Texas that's just south of Taylor, Texas in Williamson County and she knew the people in her precinct in her neighborhood so well
[01:02:52.697 --> 01:02:52.897]  That's
[01:03:09.145 --> 01:03:09.425]  I don't
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:36.145]  And if we have that level of ground troops, so to speak, then we can dominate in these elections.
[01:03:36.885 --> 01:03:38.527]  We can dominate on the ballot.
[01:03:38.547 --> 01:03:45.312]  See, another way to get around black box voting, and this is one of the things I've been talking about on a variety of programs that I get to do is that
[01:03:46.653 --> 01:03:52.960]  We can beat black box voting by being the grassroots that's so in control that we proffer up these candidates.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:53.961]  Look at this slate of candidates.
[01:03:53.981 --> 01:04:05.094]  I don't know if you can zoom in on that, and I'm not interested in whether or not if people can read that entire slate or not, because what's important is that list of patriot names that are running in all these different races.
[01:04:05.435 --> 01:04:07.417]  You've got people running for the Supreme Court.
[01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:10.219]  You've got people running for state representative seats.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.682]  I think we've got some patriots running for state senate seats.
[01:04:14.002 --> 01:04:15.844]  We've got people running for precinct chairs.
[01:04:15.944 --> 01:04:18.866]  We have got patriots running for all these different offices.
[01:04:19.427 --> 01:04:20.848]  And it doesn't stop there.
[01:04:21.308 --> 01:04:32.698]  Because what you've got to remember is it's like when Debra Medina is going out to these town halls or these debates or whatever, that's just another info warrior out there getting the message of liberty, constitution,
[01:04:33.158 --> 01:04:35.699]  Freedom, property rights, etc.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:42.303]  Each one of these is a warrior out there, a soldier, if you will, in the ground war, educating the public.
[01:04:42.663 --> 01:04:47.846]  Every town hall they do, every time they get to speak with their neighbors, they are info-warrior-ing.
[01:04:48.206 --> 01:04:50.687]  And what better way than to multitask?
[01:04:50.707 --> 01:04:54.709]  You know how the New World Order, it seems like everything they do has a multifaceted approach.
[01:04:54.729 --> 01:05:00.452]  I mean, you look at 9-11, they destroyed Building 7 because it's loaded up with all kinds of government secrets that they don't want to get out of the bag.
[01:05:01.713 --> 01:05:07.037]  Here's how we can info warrior in a multifaceted manner is by these candidates stepping up.
[01:05:07.497 --> 01:05:09.218]  And here I am in just in Travis County.
[01:05:09.798 --> 01:05:16.543]  You know, Jason, it's gotten so big that I really feel in my heart that this kind of level of activity is going on nationwide now.
[01:05:17.003 --> 01:05:18.344]  It's just there's so much of it going on.
[01:05:18.364 --> 01:05:20.145]  There's no way to keep track or know about it.
[01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:21.987]  But I'm very encouraged.
[01:05:22.267 --> 01:05:29.271]  It looks like in Kentucky, Rand Paul is probably going to win his Senate primary and most likely go on to win a Senate seat.
[01:05:29.612 --> 01:05:31.493]  So I'm thinking that what we're going to have.
[01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:38.918]  Success to me in this election coming up would be to see at least a hundred incumbents at the U.S.
[01:05:38.979 --> 01:05:40.239]  Rep level get fired.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.561]  Whether they're Republican or Democrat, I don't care.
[01:05:42.681 --> 01:05:55.171]  I just want to see a hundred incumbents lose their seats and a lot of those, the Achilles heel can happen right in the primary and if we've got patriots involved in both parties then we can be pulling the trigger and firing incumbents.
[01:05:55.831 --> 01:05:56.512]  In these primaries.
[01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:57.553]  That's the Achilles Heels.
[01:05:57.613 --> 01:06:02.216]  Because once you get to these general elections, it's harder to fire incumbents.
[01:06:02.256 --> 01:06:05.919]  Because in most gerrymandered districts, you know, you've got a bias.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:14.607]  You throw in any Democrat, and it doesn't matter what his views are, then, you know, he could be patriotic, he could be Satan, but a Democrat's going to win in that district.
[01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:16.668]  Same thing in some districts with a Republican.
[01:06:16.688 --> 01:06:17.689]  You've got a Republican bias.
[01:06:18.009 --> 01:06:20.772]  So that's why I say the Achilles Heel to the New World Order.
[01:06:21.492 --> 01:06:27.998]  I mean, they've got a variety of Achilles heels, but in the political process, these primaries is the Achilles heel.
[01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:36.806]  Well, I think if the people that are listening to this program are aware of what's going on, trade in their apathy for action, then we can do wonders.
[01:06:37.346 --> 01:06:40.349]  Again, people have to realize that they have great power themselves.
[01:06:40.389 --> 01:06:45.754]  That doesn't mean that you necessarily have to run for City Council or State Senate or Congress.
[01:06:46.354 --> 01:06:58.020]  But help somebody that you know is going to be for the Constitution, individual rights, sovereignty, the constitutional republic we live in, not just democracy.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:05.523]  Democracy is a word that's thrown around to really paralyze us and put us in a position where we don't know what to do.
[01:07:05.903 --> 01:07:11.386]  Democracy, like they say, is 51% of the population telling the other 49% that they have to go to the camps.
[01:07:11.666 --> 01:07:14.067]  That's not what this country was founded on.
[01:07:14.087 --> 01:07:15.548]  There's a reason we have states' rights.
[01:07:15.928 --> 01:07:18.829]  There's a reason we used to have a separation of powers.
[01:07:19.409 --> 01:07:22.470]  Three, count them, one, two, three branches of government.
[01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:24.090]  It was called checks and balances.
[01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:30.551]  We no longer have it in the national security state, but we had an executive branch, which is just totally corrupt with power right now.
[01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:35.433]  We had a judicial, and we had a legislative, and they were supposed to get on one another.
[01:07:35.733 --> 01:07:40.734]  But what we've seen is this consolidation of power through the military-industrial complex
[01:07:41.374 --> 01:07:45.938]  And it just keeps growing and growing and growing and growing and getting bigger.
[01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:51.402]  And I had a couple callers earlier, if you were listening to the show, they said, you know, I'm just so overwhelmed by this information.
[01:07:51.522 --> 01:07:52.743]  I don't know what to do.
[01:07:53.223 --> 01:07:54.864]  So we've already traded in their apathy.
[01:07:55.225 --> 01:07:59.328]  You know, they've gone away from, well, there's, you know, no big deal.
[01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:00.388]  We're in Afghanistan.
[01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:01.069]  We're in Iraq.
[01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:03.591]  I see people don't even realize we're still in two wars.
[01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:05.172]  It's just like every day.
[01:08:05.292 --> 01:08:07.394]  I mean, when Bush was in, it was a big deal.
[01:08:07.674 --> 01:08:18.217]  We had anti-war demonstrations all the time, but the Savior comes in, and the left, Code Pink, all the frauds, refuse, refuse to step out into the streets.
[01:08:18.237 --> 01:08:21.958]  And then the real deal, Cindy Sheehan, rises above it all.
[01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:23.339]  She's out in D.C.
[01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:27.580]  right now, trying to get a tent city going of protesters.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.241]  And now the left hates her.
[01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:30.721]  They refuse to talk about her.
[01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:32.643]  The mainstream media won't even cover her.
[01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:45.310]  People need to realize that this is a system of command and control and they will use and have used and continue to use well-meaning, good people to continue their agenda.
[01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:46.710]  So we have to be aware of that.
[01:08:47.111 --> 01:08:47.411]  And again,
[01:08:47.751 --> 01:08:49.372]  Let's just trade in the apathy for action.
[01:08:49.432 --> 01:08:50.273]  Knock on doors.
[01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:51.333]  Make phone calls.
[01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:52.334]  Get out there.
[01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:53.475]  Make posters.
[01:08:53.495 --> 01:08:55.817]  I know there's a lot of talented artists out there.
[01:08:56.177 --> 01:08:57.017]  Make some posters.
[01:08:57.077 --> 01:08:57.918]  Get out in the streets.
[01:08:58.098 --> 01:09:01.200]  I know there's a lot of talented graffiti artists out there.
[01:09:01.921 --> 01:09:03.662]  I've heard more and more lately.
[01:09:04.122 --> 01:09:14.450]  In the city of London, in the city of New York, in Chicago, people are spray painting InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and getting people aware.
[01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:16.151]  I mean, there's guerrilla activism.
[01:09:16.171 --> 01:09:18.633]  There's so much each and every one of us can do.
[01:09:19.194 --> 01:09:19.574]  That's right.
[01:09:19.594 --> 01:09:24.618]  If we just step up to the plate, that's when we start to win, and you made some great points by saying,
[01:09:25.058 --> 01:09:27.300]  That the people just need to get off their apathy.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:35.106]  I think we really are, I had a caller one day saying that the independents in Connecticut are at about the 50% threshold.
[01:09:35.586 --> 01:09:40.750]  That independents, patriot minded people, constitutionally minded people are at the 50% threshold.
[01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:44.733]  I think that's a nationwide phenomenon and what ends up controlling
[01:09:45.413 --> 01:09:52.078]  The Republican Party and the Democrat Party are only about two or three percent of the people end up controlling those.
[01:09:52.118 --> 01:10:00.945]  So if these patriots just divvied them up amongst themselves and got into the Democrat, Republican Party, Libertarians, keep your positions in the Libertarian Party.
[01:10:01.005 --> 01:10:01.466]  Don't let
[01:10:02.086 --> 01:10:05.569]  I'm convinced of that fact because I've seen the numbers continue to grow.
[01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:09.652]  I've watched these elections continue to grow our numbers and there's just no stopping us.
[01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:12.094]  The question is, will we be allowed to have time
[01:10:23.443 --> 01:10:28.185]  And for the folks that don't want to get involved, there is nowhere to run or nowhere to hide.
[01:10:28.285 --> 01:10:33.127]  Alex says this on the show frequently, that he would go off to some other country if there were another place to go to.
[01:10:33.247 --> 01:10:33.627]  Nowhere to go.
[01:10:33.687 --> 01:10:34.868]  But there's nowhere to go.
[01:10:34.928 --> 01:10:35.368]  This is it.
[01:10:35.428 --> 01:10:36.788]  This is the time to make your stand.
[01:10:37.409 --> 01:10:40.170]  And the time to make your stand is not when the bullets start to fly.
[01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.510]  It is too late at that point.
[01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:45.352]  And from that point of view, I think that the war has been lost by us.
[01:10:45.872 --> 01:10:50.538]  If we see bullets start flying, that's where we've got an opportunity right now and this is it.
[01:10:50.598 --> 01:10:51.299]  We need to take it.
[01:10:51.339 --> 01:10:55.444]  We need to move forward and keep people activated and they're coming.
[01:10:55.544 --> 01:10:56.685]  They're coming that way.
[01:10:57.286 --> 01:11:00.610]  The Tea Party movement, like I said, despite the fact that
[01:11:01.414 --> 01:11:04.615]  Glenn Beck and others at Sean Hannity's, they try to co-opt it.
[01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.135]  You see Rick Perry try to co-opt it.
[01:11:06.155 --> 01:11:09.496]  They're trying to get Ron Paul out of office through the Tea Party movement right now.
[01:11:09.516 --> 01:11:11.137]  I mean, that is unbelievable to me.
[01:11:11.437 --> 01:11:16.138]  They are literally running candidates against Ron Paul as Tea Party tickets.
[01:11:16.558 --> 01:11:19.319]  These people aren't for the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:22.940]  We have to redouble our efforts to make sure that Ron Paul is a Texas Congressman.
[01:11:23.561 --> 01:11:27.782]  Well, Ron Paul has weathered these storms before, and I fully expect him to weather it again.
[01:11:27.822 --> 01:11:32.183]  So folks in that area of Texas, get out there and work with Ron Paul and get him back in.
[01:11:32.343 --> 01:11:34.323]  We're going to come back, do a little bit of a news blitz.
[01:11:34.363 --> 01:11:35.224]  Take your calls.
[01:11:35.284 --> 01:11:36.244]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:11:36.344 --> 01:11:37.664]  I am Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:11:37.744 --> 01:11:39.785]  Richard Reeves is in studio.
[01:11:39.805 --> 01:11:45.206]  Remember, if you missed any of the broadcasts, go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and pick up the free podcast.
[01:11:52.136 --> 01:11:55.338]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:11:55.698 --> 01:11:57.519]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:11:57.979 --> 01:11:58.399]  Don't!
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.881]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:09.425]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:12:09.405 --> 01:12:11.066]  's number one debt secret.
[01:12:11.386 --> 01:12:15.088]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:12:15.468 --> 01:12:18.150]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:25.612]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:12:25.952 --> 01:12:26.932]  Herb K. was right.
[01:12:27.132 --> 01:12:30.173]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:12:30.313 --> 01:12:31.333]  What have you got to lose?
[01:12:31.673 --> 01:12:34.874]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:36.114]  Get Herb K.'
[01:12:36.014 --> 01:12:39.055]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:12:39.335 --> 01:12:39.675]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:44.176]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:12:44.196 --> 01:12:44.236]  888-352-7726.
[01:12:44.256 --> 01:12:47.078]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:12:47.118 --> 01:12:49.660]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.542]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:13:02.705 --> 01:13:05.346]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:05.366 --> 01:13:11.587]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:11.767 --> 01:13:16.788]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:26.931]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:27.051 --> 01:13:29.152]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:29.392 --> 01:13:30.733]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:30.993 --> 01:13:33.254]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:33.455 --> 01:13:35.275]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:35.576 --> 01:13:40.358]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:13:40.718 --> 01:13:45.501]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:49.843]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:54.101]  Hi, this is Peter Krashnobel with Midas Resources.
[01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:58.943]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[01:13:59.043 --> 01:14:05.506]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[01:14:05.647 --> 01:14:08.068]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[01:14:08.148 --> 01:14:10.629]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[01:14:10.749 --> 01:14:15.691]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[01:14:15.891 --> 01:14:17.232]  Lose on your capital investment,
[01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:20.594]  And when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that is losing value every day.
[01:14:20.774 --> 01:14:26.958]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[01:14:27.118 --> 01:14:30.980]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:31.821]  Call me today.
[01:14:31.881 --> 01:14:32.661]  Peter Krochnay, 1-800-686-7000.
[01:14:34.482 --> 01:14:35.063]  Aerial Spring.
[01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:35.463]  Chemtrails.
[01:14:35.503 --> 01:14:36.244]  The Modified Atmosphere.
[01:15:03.393 --> 01:15:09.478]  Heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[01:15:10.178 --> 01:15:12.700]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:20.286]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:15:20.486 --> 01:15:27.191]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[01:15:27.691 --> 01:15:30.893]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:32.855]  Cleaning out heavy metals,
[01:15:33.379 --> 01:15:34.900]  Parasites and toxins.
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:40.103]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long-term storage.
[01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:43.705]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today.
[01:15:58.024 --> 01:15:58.684]  We are back!
[01:15:58.724 --> 01:16:00.105]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:00.165 --> 01:16:01.085]  I am Jason Burmess.
[01:16:01.105 --> 01:16:02.505]  Sitting in while Alex is out on assignment.
[01:16:02.565 --> 01:16:05.006]  We are joined by Richard Reeves in studio.
[01:16:16.021 --> 01:16:19.325]  I just wanted to hit a couple of the other big stories that we haven't covered yet today.
[01:16:19.385 --> 01:16:23.529]  Repossessions at highest level since 1995 in the UK.
[01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:30.556]  They're saying it rose by 15% in 2009, but the final quarter figures were 13%.
[01:16:30.977 --> 01:16:35.662]  That's still over 1 out of every 10 people in the UK losing their house.
[01:16:35.962 --> 01:16:37.664]  I mean they're just repossessing everything.
[01:16:37.945 --> 01:16:40.288]  This is a global issue.
[01:16:40.328 --> 01:16:45.975]  This is a global economic crisis and it's been construed in a way...
[01:16:46.786 --> 01:16:47.326]  We're good to go.
[01:17:06.258 --> 01:17:09.360]  We're not going to be issuing dollars anymore to third world nations.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.802]  We're going to be issuing SDRs.
[01:17:11.842 --> 01:17:15.044]  That's Special Drawing Rights Units.
[01:17:15.224 --> 01:17:17.726]  It is the global currency.
[01:17:17.786 --> 01:17:21.148]  You can type in SDR conversion rate.
[01:17:21.188 --> 01:17:26.492]  You go to the IMF's own website and it is top dog.
[01:17:26.552 --> 01:17:28.573]  The SDR is the top.
[01:17:29.554 --> 01:17:32.335]  Out of the big currencies, the dollar ain't looking so good.
[01:17:32.616 --> 01:17:40.239]  You know, the pound's above it, the euro's above it, the Bahrain Dinar is above it, and it just keeps sinking and sinking and sinking.
[01:17:40.279 --> 01:17:43.001]  That's why it's important to, you know, reiterate.
[01:17:43.321 --> 01:17:54.767]  Things are bad all over, and they're going to offer us the solution like they're the savior, whether that be an Amaro or a global currency coin like the one that Medvedev showed people after the G8.
[01:17:55.367 --> 01:17:56.748]  I mean, this is really happening, Richard.
[01:17:57.268 --> 01:18:23.264]  It is absolutely really happening and it is the slow demise of the dollar but it's a double-edged sword because it's at one point you know they could pull the plug on the dollar anytime they could just call up all the banks one day or email them or whatever they do and say hey banks no more cash goes out today ATMs frozen can't get your money out and they could do that so we're blessed in that at least we've got more time to react that 13% number that you put out about the UK of those folks
[01:18:23.744 --> 01:18:24.844]  They're homes being repossessed.
[01:18:25.364 --> 01:18:28.525]  Imagine if that were in the 20 or 30 percent range and the outrage.
[01:18:28.565 --> 01:18:30.705]  I mean, 13 percent, you know they're outraged.
[01:18:30.745 --> 01:18:31.406]  Those folks are.
[01:18:31.866 --> 01:18:35.686]  And here in the United States, I think that number of repossessions is probably 8 or 10 percent.
[01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:42.748]  It's a pretty high number, but at least the New World Order is measuring how fast they can move forward with their agenda.
[01:18:42.768 --> 01:18:52.590]  And of course, the listeners to this show already know that the ultimate goal is the cashless society and everybody putting on the mark of the beast and everybody having to
[01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:56.872]  Thumbprint and thumb scan and who knows what else?
[01:18:56.912 --> 01:19:00.713]  And they beta test these things in different parts of the globe.
[01:19:00.753 --> 01:19:07.996]  And right now they're getting to beta test army on the streets to confront terror threats where?
[01:19:08.136 --> 01:19:09.076]  In the United Kingdom.
[01:19:09.336 --> 01:19:11.317]  And it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:19:11.557 --> 01:19:18.400]  It is to acclimate the public to get used to the military on the streets like they have in China.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.041]  Where the military is the police, the police are
[01:19:21.101 --> 01:19:25.662]  You are the military, you are guilty until proven innocent.
[01:19:25.682 --> 01:19:27.223]  This is out of the independent.
[01:19:27.283 --> 01:19:33.525]  Britain's armed forces could be used on a regular basis on the streets of Britain to confront the threat of terrorism.
[01:19:33.805 --> 01:19:41.027]  Even though the last big terror attack was carried out by their own people, the 7-7 bombings of 2004, it's been proven time and time again.
[01:19:41.707 --> 01:19:53.801]  We had the head of Visor Consultants go on Sky News and the BBC that day, that day, and admit they were running a drill for people he didn't want to name.
[01:19:53.861 --> 01:19:55.943]  He didn't want to name the people he was running the drill for.
[01:19:56.664 --> 01:20:02.107]  He's still blowing up the same three train stations at the same exact time.
[01:20:02.347 --> 01:20:12.212]  And when he was confronted about it by We Are Change Ireland last year, he walked into a closet and closed the door instead of actually answering the questions.
[01:20:12.553 --> 01:20:14.574]  These are, he knows what happened.
[01:20:14.894 --> 01:20:19.116]  He knows damn well what happened and he knows he better keep his mouth shut.
[01:20:19.596 --> 01:20:22.358]  And they are beta testing all sorts of things in the United Kingdom.
[01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:42.957]  CCTV cameras in homes for the worst families, Sinbin families, Internet Eyes is about to launch where they're going to pay you for good tips as you watch live CCTV cameras and report on criminals creating this tattletale nightmare society that we've only read about in books like 1984.
[01:20:44.537 --> 01:20:52.921]  Well, 1984 appears to be trying to come to fruition there in England, and at least we've got that luxury of being able to watch it happening across the pond.
[01:20:53.301 --> 01:21:05.267]  But folks, do not wait to get active, as Jason said earlier, because that will be coming here, and the New World Order does go country by country and have different levels of New World Order activity, but they're everywhere.
[01:21:06.288 --> 01:21:07.869]  Well let's go to another beta test, okay?
[01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:09.651]  Let's look at Afghanistan.
[01:21:09.691 --> 01:21:11.333]  What are they beta testing in Afghanistan?
[01:21:11.393 --> 01:21:12.073]  Biometrics!
[01:21:12.714 --> 01:21:21.562]  Everybody who's in a quote-unquote combat zone has to give up their thumbprint, they have to give up their iris scan, they have to be facially recognized.
[01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:24.984]  And they're slaves in their own country.
[01:21:25.284 --> 01:21:28.105]  They're slaves in their own country, folks.
[01:21:28.185 --> 01:21:30.046]  And I don't want to be a slave.
[01:21:30.526 --> 01:21:34.528]  I refuse to bow down and worship my overlords.
[01:21:34.728 --> 01:21:35.889]  We'll be back after this.
[01:21:36.409 --> 01:21:37.389]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:37.429 --> 01:21:38.490]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:40.690]  PrisonPlanet.tv and FullWars.com.
[01:21:42.411 --> 01:21:43.352]  We're on the march.
[01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.432]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:46.353 --> 01:21:49.034]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:51.650 --> 01:21:58.513]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:00.594]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:22:00.714 --> 01:22:02.835]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:22:02.955 --> 01:22:04.475]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:22:53.814 --> 01:22:57.475]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:57.835 --> 01:23:00.856]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:01.096 --> 01:23:02.496]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:23:03.217 --> 01:23:05.878]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:12.120]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:17.302]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:23:17.822 --> 01:23:27.446]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:23:27.566 --> 01:23:29.667]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:29.907 --> 01:23:31.247]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:33.768]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:23:33.968 --> 01:23:35.788]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:36.089 --> 01:23:40.850]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:50.353]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:52.771 --> 01:23:56.756]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[01:23:57.057 --> 01:23:59.900]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:24:00.321 --> 01:24:08.111]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:08.891]  We're good to go.
[01:24:29.906 --> 01:24:30.146]  I think so.
[01:25:00.145 --> 01:25:00.374]  Yeah.
[01:25:03.129 --> 01:25:03.989]  We are back.
[01:25:04.009 --> 01:25:04.790]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:07.491]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in as Alex is on assignment.
[01:25:07.611 --> 01:25:14.855]  I want to remind everybody this week we launched the incredible free, yes free, iPhone app.
[01:25:15.455 --> 01:25:16.055]  No cash.
[01:25:16.095 --> 01:25:18.577]  So you type in InfoWars, you type in Alex Jones.
[01:25:18.997 --> 01:25:20.498]  Don't pay for any apps.
[01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:23.659]  Get our free listen live app.
[01:25:23.699 --> 01:25:24.840]  Maybe you're listening right now.
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.341]  Maybe you just tuned in.
[01:25:26.381 --> 01:25:28.762]  You've got an iPhone but you're about to take a trip.
[01:25:29.222 --> 01:25:29.882]  Well that's great.
[01:25:30.022 --> 01:25:30.903]  Get on your iPhone.
[01:25:31.423 --> 01:25:37.148]  Type in Alex Jones, get the app, put in your 3.5 jack, and listen wherever you go.
[01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:39.871]  I'm so excited about this Alex Jones iPhone app.
[01:25:39.891 --> 01:25:47.098]  I know it's going to be coming to the Blackberries and everything else probably in the next couple of weeks, but it's another way for us to reach an even larger audience, Richard.
[01:25:47.558 --> 01:25:49.238]  Absolutely, I'm really excited about that too.
[01:25:49.379 --> 01:25:54.760]  I came onto the iPod, downloading the iPod, the podcast, etc.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.921]  two or three years ago and it's a great thing.
[01:25:56.941 --> 01:26:07.503]  I remember, I can't tell you how many shortwave radios that I used to use out of my car and damage the antenna because I'd hit my power window button and it'd get bent up as the power window's going up.
[01:26:07.844 --> 01:26:09.264]  So those days of having to
[01:26:09.884 --> 01:26:15.126]  Struggle to get truth and freedom oriented broadcasts like Alex Jones, GCNlive.com, etc.
[01:26:15.526 --> 01:26:26.189]  That was very difficult and now it's just keep it keeps getting easier and easier But we've got to use this while we've got it because as you stated earlier in this program The internet is subject to being cut off anytime.
[01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:27.690]  That's just like our banking system
[01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:33.353]  The powers that be, the New World Order, they can flip a few switches and all of a sudden no cash at the ATMs.
[01:26:33.693 --> 01:26:35.675]  We've seen things like that happen in Iceland.
[01:26:35.755 --> 01:26:39.177]  You were talking about the biometric scanning going on in Afghanistan.
[01:26:39.457 --> 01:26:45.861]  We saw back I guess around 2001 era that Argentina basically going belly up and all the things that happened there.
[01:26:46.681 --> 01:26:58.771]  We cannot continue to wait any longer because pretty soon that front page news around the world that there's just destitution and poverty everywhere will be the story about here, right here in the USA, right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:26:59.351 --> 01:27:03.074]  And this audience, though, I've got to say congratulations that you're listening.
[01:27:03.434 --> 01:27:08.138]  This is the most important political audience on the face of the earth.
[01:27:08.198 --> 01:27:11.480]  If there's another one, I want to know about it because there cannot be.
[01:27:11.861 --> 01:27:15.804]  I've been a talk radio junkie for many years because of my career as a driver.
[01:27:16.484 --> 01:27:17.345]  And this is it.
[01:27:17.445 --> 01:27:19.107]  This is the audience that's gonna make the difference.
[01:27:19.748 --> 01:27:25.374]  I want to congratulate the folks that are out there and download the podcast, get that iPhone app, etc.
[01:27:25.474 --> 01:27:30.260]  They really are the most read, the most learned, and the most active of any audience out there.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.321]  This is the largest...
[01:27:31.681 --> 01:27:32.702]  Thank you so much, man.
[01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:52.614]  You just mentioned the MI5.
[01:27:52.674 --> 01:27:54.555]  I thought I'd hit this headline.
[01:27:54.595 --> 01:28:02.039]  Top judge, Binyam Mohammed case shows MI5 to be devious, dishonest, and get this, complicit in torture.
[01:28:02.079 --> 01:28:02.339]  Who knew?
[01:28:02.659 --> 01:28:03.180]  We did!
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.261]  We've been telling you that the MI5, MI6, CIA,
[01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:12.204]  ISI, all part of the same Anglo-American establishment.
[01:28:12.604 --> 01:28:20.867]  All part of the international intelligence organization that will work hook or by crook with terrorists, murderers, killers.
[01:28:20.907 --> 01:28:22.467]  They like these psychophants!
[01:28:22.847 --> 01:28:24.268]  I mean, they recruit them!
[01:28:24.747 --> 01:28:26.268]  Oh absolutely, absolutely.
[01:28:26.348 --> 01:28:29.510]  They proffer their military industrial complex this way.
[01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:32.892]  I mean we've seen that, the problem reaction solution over and over.
[01:28:32.912 --> 01:28:41.978]  It's been discussed, the Galean dialectic, where if they create the crisis they can come in with a solution and these intelligence agencies over and over
[01:28:42.278 --> 01:28:42.578]  I don't know.
[01:28:58.897 --> 01:29:05.382]  Right and so you know you step on some big toes when you start stepping on the Federal Reserve boys that they're connected with the intelligence agencies.
[01:29:05.742 --> 01:29:08.084]  You stepped on some of the oil boys down here in Texas.
[01:29:08.484 --> 01:29:10.906]  You step on all those toes and all of a sudden look what happened.
[01:29:10.926 --> 01:29:19.773]  So but the thing of it is now with so many more people getting wise to the situation there are too many of us to put it away to put away the truth.
[01:29:19.893 --> 01:29:20.694]  There are too many of us.
[01:29:20.714 --> 01:29:23.236]  So what we need to do now is just keep charging forward.
[01:29:23.736 --> 01:29:24.216]  Absolutely.
[01:29:24.256 --> 01:29:25.237]  Let's take some callers.
[01:29:25.257 --> 01:29:26.077]  Let's go to Karen in Oregon.
[01:29:26.097 --> 01:29:27.017]  Karen, you're on the line.
[01:29:27.037 --> 01:29:27.257]  Yes, Karen.
[01:29:43.115 --> 01:30:02.346]  What we're calling for at TaxFree15.com is a national strike for four days, April 15th through April 18th, with those of us who can on the 19th presenting assigned articles of freedom with Bob Schultz's group or signed petitions for state sovereignty to our state officials.
[01:30:02.826 --> 01:30:07.129]  We feel that so many things out there have gone so poorly.
[01:30:07.754 --> 01:30:14.743]  And as long as we keep going about our lives as regular and normal, pretending somebody else will save us, it's not going to happen.
[01:30:14.803 --> 01:30:22.413]  So we're calling for a complete and total withdrawal of support and finances for four consecutive days at TaxFree15.com.
[01:30:24.035 --> 01:30:26.317]  Well, I like how you've done that on April 15th.
[01:30:26.337 --> 01:30:29.179]  You definitely picked a great date to do that, and I wish you all the best.
[01:30:29.219 --> 01:30:30.020]  What do you think, Richard?
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.261]  April 15th is absolutely the perfect day.
[01:30:32.282 --> 01:30:45.912]  I used to be a truck driver, and truck drivers, basically, you get treated like a second-class citizen right there, because you're really kind of at the forefront of the New World Order and their operations with their commercial driver's licenses, their CDLs, their documentation.
[01:30:46.552 --> 01:30:48.813]  They want a 10-year work history if you get a job.
[01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:52.235]  They really, and that was back in 97 when I got out.
[01:30:52.395 --> 01:30:53.376]  I got out of that industry.
[01:30:53.796 --> 01:30:58.538]  But I tell you, you really got a taste of being a second-class citizen as a truck driver.
[01:30:58.918 --> 01:31:11.785]  And one thing I want to caution people is, yes, we need to do some kind of general strike like that or whatever, but I think we need to limit it to maybe a day, like April 15th is the ideal day, because it was so hard to wrangle those independent cats.
[01:31:12.305 --> 01:31:28.917]  So many of them are just over broke in the trucking industry that despite the fact that they were all going broke to get them organized to do a week-long event or anything like that was just oh yeah they would sign on for it but then they wouldn't do it when it comes time to do it because hey they got to put bread on the table they got to feed their family.
[01:31:28.937 --> 01:31:30.558]  And we're a debtor nation now.
[01:31:30.578 --> 01:31:31.799]  I mean we are a debtor nation.
[01:31:32.139 --> 01:31:33.180]  So I think
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:34.601]  Great idea.
[01:31:34.801 --> 01:31:40.226]  Limit it to one day to where you really pound on it and don't do business like she was saying.
[01:31:40.706 --> 01:31:42.327]  I think something like that's going to really happen.
[01:31:42.367 --> 01:31:49.073]  That idea has been talked about many times and it's building up to that and if we could do it for four days or a week it would be outstanding.
[01:31:51.010 --> 01:32:02.633]  People need to realize, you know, our grandparents and some of our parents, depending on how old you are out there, they saved.
[01:32:03.013 --> 01:32:05.494]  They bought things when they could afford things.
[01:32:05.934 --> 01:32:10.736]  They didn't just get a credit card or get a mortgage and then all of a sudden they're in debt.
[01:32:12.316 --> 01:32:16.320]  As a people, no longer have any wealth to ourselves.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.561]  Very few of us save.
[01:32:17.861 --> 01:32:19.203]  Very few of us have a savings account.
[01:32:19.363 --> 01:32:23.527]  There are so many people out there that are on, you know, check to check.
[01:32:23.607 --> 01:32:26.329]  They're living paycheck to paycheck to paycheck.
[01:32:26.349 --> 01:32:32.555]  And you're seeing it more and more in families with two or three children where they would have been middle class 10, 20, 30 years ago.
[01:32:35.658 --> 01:32:36.338]  They're destitute.
[01:32:36.358 --> 01:32:37.359]  They're almost broke.
[01:32:37.399 --> 01:32:39.580]  They're about to have their home repossessed.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:43.862]  So it's time to really rethink how we're living as a society.
[01:32:44.202 --> 01:32:49.605]  It's not time to go out and get that new credit card so you can afford the iPad when it launches.
[01:32:49.725 --> 01:32:55.868]  It's time to put that money away and maybe invest in some gold or silver or storable foods.
[01:32:56.649 --> 01:32:59.330]  Or maybe a solar panel and a cola blue.
[01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:00.911]  Something to make yourself
[01:33:01.551 --> 01:33:04.453]  A little more independent and a little more off the grid.
[01:33:04.774 --> 01:33:05.214]  That's right.
[01:33:05.254 --> 01:33:14.141]  I mean, we see the centralization going on all around us on everything, whether it's energy, whether it's fuel, whether it's food, whether it's, you name it, housing.
[01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:16.103]  It's like they try to put us in the compact cities.
[01:33:16.523 --> 01:33:20.766]  So it just never ends on the avenues of attack that we're being confronted with.
[01:33:21.087 --> 01:33:22.448]  So that's exactly right.
[01:33:22.528 --> 01:33:25.210]  We need to do as much as we can to be more independent.
[01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:31.053]  We need to push back on that to where we are more independent, growing our own food, having our own place to live out in the country.
[01:33:31.353 --> 01:33:46.901]  But at the same time, they make it harder and harder because they've run this money system on us for so long and, like you said, gotten so many people into the trap of being debtors because that's how they enslave so many people, not just here in the United States, but around the world.
[01:33:47.121 --> 01:33:49.682]  Not just people too, but entire countries as well.
[01:33:49.802 --> 01:33:54.945]  Well, I remember being blown away as a 17-year-old kid graduating high school.
[01:33:55.265 --> 01:33:59.451]  And I went to the open house for my college the summer before.
[01:34:00.032 --> 01:34:08.964]  And right there as I'm signing up for my meal card, or my identification card, so that you can go to the meal hall and swipe for your things.
[01:34:09.565 --> 01:34:10.646]  And what was the other thing?
[01:34:10.686 --> 01:34:11.547]  My email account.
[01:34:12.108 --> 01:34:14.891]  They're sign-ups for credit cards, right?
[01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:22.639]  I mean, as you're going there to go to school, they're trying to sign up 17- and 18-year-olds to get their first credit card.
[01:34:22.659 --> 01:34:31.808]  I don't know about you, Richard, but I wasn't the most responsible fiscally at 17 and 18 years old, and the system banks on that sort of attitude.
[01:34:32.048 --> 01:34:32.388]  That's right.
[01:34:32.408 --> 01:34:40.497]  They love the college graduates by design coming out 50, 60, 70, $80,000 in debt with student loans, credit card loans, etc.
[01:34:40.877 --> 01:34:41.738]  That enslaves them.
[01:34:41.798 --> 01:34:43.880]  That disempowers them from being active.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:50.827]  It means that they've got to get their nose to the grindstone to feed themselves, to clothe and house themselves and their families.
[01:34:51.247 --> 01:34:54.791]  That limits the ability to be out there and be active.
[01:34:55.171 --> 01:34:58.234]  Because, let me tell you, being politically active takes a toll on you.
[01:34:58.254 --> 01:34:58.995]  It takes the time.
[01:34:59.035 --> 01:34:59.635]  It takes the effort.
[01:35:00.015 --> 01:35:00.736]  I know you've done it.
[01:35:00.796 --> 01:35:01.477]  You've been out there.
[01:35:01.877 --> 01:35:05.240]  And so, folks, I just have to say, you've got to make that sacrifice now.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.261]  You've got a lot.
[01:35:06.361 --> 01:35:11.285]  Sometimes, I know most people, if you've got a couple of kids or whatever, that's like two full-time jobs.
[01:35:11.946 --> 01:35:16.488]  Full-time job per kid, and then you've got a full-time job to work to put bread on the table.
[01:35:16.808 --> 01:35:18.069]  That's like three full-time jobs.
[01:35:18.089 --> 01:35:27.393]  Well, I'll tell you what, there's a fourth part-time job, or fifth part-time, there's a part-time job you need to take on, and that's bringing back and saving this republic here in Texas and the country.
[01:35:27.633 --> 01:35:28.893]  I agree with you a hundred percent.
[01:35:28.933 --> 01:35:29.974]  Let's go to another caller.
[01:35:30.354 --> 01:35:31.554]  Jim in Virginia.
[01:35:31.614 --> 01:35:32.215]  Jim, you're online.
[01:35:32.915 --> 01:35:34.136]  Hey, good afternoon, Jason and Richard.
[01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:39.678]  I wanted to kind of get into a little bit about the Glenn Beck
[01:35:40.507 --> 01:35:42.749]  I was not too sure about what to make of him.
[01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:51.255]  Then I heard this interview he did with Debra Medina, and there's no question that he's just a complete phony, and he had only one purpose, and that was to knock her down.
[01:35:51.536 --> 01:35:53.637]  Well, let me give you my Glenn Beck story, okay?
[01:35:53.757 --> 01:36:01.223]  I was supposed to be on Glenn Beck on the fifth anniversary of 9-11, back in the day when he was still on CNN, and he wasn't being given all this attention.
[01:36:01.543 --> 01:36:05.826]  He wasn't copying Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:06.087 --> 01:36:08.889]  He was keeping it extremely mainline.
[01:36:09.289 --> 01:36:12.490]  Now, I had been booked on this show for over a month.
[01:36:12.831 --> 01:36:13.971]  Over a month we'd been booked.
[01:36:14.451 --> 01:36:16.092]  Dylan and I were supposed to go on that show.
[01:36:16.612 --> 01:36:20.954]  Now, we were supposed to oppose popular mechanics, James Maggs and David Dunbar.
[01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:23.795]  They were the ones that wrote this article that turned into a book.
[01:36:24.015 --> 01:36:25.436]  They're the main debunkers!
[01:36:26.016 --> 01:36:34.038]  Now, earlier in the day, I go on live television and radio to debate these same two people on Amy Goodman's Democracy Now.
[01:36:34.378 --> 01:36:35.419]  And she's actually pretty fair.
[01:36:35.479 --> 01:36:37.379]  Pretty fair moderator, lets me say what I want.
[01:36:37.619 --> 01:36:39.380]  I eat these guys alive.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.401]  I encourage anybody out there, type in loose change, popular mechanics debate, to watch the whole thing.
[01:36:44.481 --> 01:36:51.783]  I mean, I'm inches away from Megs, and he's stuttering, stammering, he can't get out a full sentence, he looks guilty as sin.
[01:36:52.623 --> 01:36:55.044]  We were immediately cancelled on Glenn Beck.
[01:36:55.524 --> 01:37:01.967]  James Meggs was able to propagate his lies over some video or some tapes of our movie, you know?
[01:37:02.427 --> 01:37:05.808]  And right there, I knew the guy was completely illegitimate.
[01:37:06.088 --> 01:37:09.409]  Let's fast forward now to the Georgia conflict.
[01:37:09.569 --> 01:37:16.292]  Now, if you're new to the program, you may not know what happened in Georgia a little under two years ago.
[01:37:17.312 --> 01:37:28.044]  The mainline story was the evil Russians had gone into South Ossetia and just started murdering people, and they were going after Georgia, and Georgia was defending itself.
[01:37:28.104 --> 01:37:34.071]  It was this great republic, and Saakashvili, their leader, was so for freedom and justice.
[01:37:34.111 --> 01:37:35.072]  He's just the greatest.
[01:37:36.072 --> 01:37:42.197]  So he goes on Glenn Beck's Sockersville and starts talking to Glenn about how this isn't about him.
[01:37:42.677 --> 01:37:45.019]  This is about a new world order.
[01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:48.362]  Literally says, new world order on the air.
[01:37:48.682 --> 01:37:50.223]  Do you think Glenn Beck called him on it?
[01:37:50.563 --> 01:37:52.004]  Do you think Glenn Beck said something?
[01:37:52.285 --> 01:37:59.270]  Glenn Beck called him a great person and humanitarian and said, God be with you to this man.
[01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:02.412]  I am throwing up in my mouth when I watch this.
[01:38:02.633 --> 01:38:03.834]  Let me tell you what happened.
[01:38:04.574 --> 01:38:06.516]  In Georgia and South Ossetia.
[01:38:06.976 --> 01:38:17.526]  The Georgians were running drills on the border of South Ossetia with Israeli special forces and Blackwater US military privatized groups.
[01:38:17.786 --> 01:38:18.507]  Running these drills.
[01:38:18.827 --> 01:38:19.088]  Okay?
[01:38:19.768 --> 01:38:24.333]  So Russia sees this and they say, well we better start running our own drills because what if these things go live?
[01:38:25.287 --> 01:38:26.368]  All of a sudden they go live.
[01:38:26.889 --> 01:38:36.579]  Georgia goes and sneak attacks South Osetia, murdering people, and Russia goes in to stop it, and they're demonized in the press for over a year.
[01:38:36.799 --> 01:38:40.963]  The only mainline guy that I know of that told the truth was Pat Buchanan, Richard.
[01:38:41.684 --> 01:38:41.944]  Right.
[01:38:42.325 --> 01:38:44.126]  Well, it doesn't surprise me about Glenn Beck.
[01:38:44.166 --> 01:38:56.937]  That's how it got started was Glenn Beck has definitely been a big wolf in sheep's clothing, and he single-handedly today, with that interview that he did today, he became the de facto leader of 9-11 Liar.
[01:38:56.957 --> 01:38:58.078]  9-11 Liar.
[01:38:58.138 --> 01:38:59.459]  How would you like to have that title?
[01:38:59.779 --> 01:39:02.302]  Glenn Beck, I tell you what, write this date down.
[01:39:03.703 --> 01:39:03.943]  2-11-10.
[01:39:04.223 --> 01:39:05.624]  Today's the 11th.
[01:39:05.644 --> 01:39:06.444]  2-11.
[01:39:06.464 --> 01:39:07.825]  2-11, Glenn Beck.
[01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:08.985]  This is your day.
[01:39:09.246 --> 01:39:16.109]  Your slide to infamy as a traitor here in the United States has really accelerated.
[01:39:16.449 --> 01:39:32.218]  And I think what needs to happen is the great info warriors out there in this audience need to make sure that every phone call Glenn Beck gets to his program, every email he gets needs to be from 9-11 Truthers, it needs to be from Patriots, calling him out on his Benedict Arnold activity.
[01:39:32.498 --> 01:39:34.099]  The guy is just amazing.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:36.501]  And he's in trouble.
[01:39:36.902 --> 01:39:40.264]  Glenn Beck, this will be a day that will live in infamy for you.
[01:39:40.284 --> 01:39:41.005]  2-11-10.
[01:39:41.866 --> 01:39:42.486]  Jot it down.
[01:39:42.927 --> 01:39:46.790]  You know, I'm sure he sleeps really well at night on his pile of $50 million.
[01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:48.791]  Let's go to Karen.
[01:39:48.951 --> 01:39:50.353]  I think we already went to Karen in Oregon.
[01:39:50.393 --> 01:39:51.794]  Let's go to Mike in Ohio.
[01:39:51.874 --> 01:39:53.135]  Mike in Ohio, you're on the line.
[01:39:54.296 --> 01:39:54.616]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:55.857 --> 01:39:57.298]  Hey, Jason.
[01:39:57.839 --> 01:39:58.099]  Hey, hey.
[01:39:59.836 --> 01:40:04.498]  I just called you guys to let you know about a little bit of news happening here in Ohio.
[01:40:04.518 --> 01:40:11.141]  I work for an international heating and air conditioning company, and I was told today I'd be fired if I didn't thumb scan.
[01:40:12.202 --> 01:40:12.542]  Really?
[01:40:12.582 --> 01:40:12.762]  Wow.
[01:40:13.002 --> 01:40:13.782]  So what did they say?
[01:40:13.842 --> 01:40:18.104]  That we're implementing a new, uh, what would they call it?
[01:40:18.124 --> 01:40:19.325]  A new regulation?
[01:40:19.585 --> 01:40:22.226]  Or, you know, a new policy.
[01:40:22.246 --> 01:40:23.847]  That's right, it's always a new policy.
[01:40:24.007 --> 01:40:27.248]  And what do you have to thumb scan now as your time ticket?
[01:40:27.628 --> 01:40:28.329]  So you come in and...
[01:40:29.981 --> 01:40:31.765]  It's unbelievable.
[01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:33.930]  Do you want to say what company you work for?
[01:40:34.792 --> 01:40:35.955]  How many years have you been working there?
[01:40:36.693 --> 01:40:41.635]  I've been here for three and a half years, and we just moved into a new warehouse, and the new time clocks came with it.
[01:40:42.815 --> 01:40:45.376]  Well, I mean, you gotta just scream to high hell.
[01:40:45.416 --> 01:40:46.296]  I know it's not easy.
[01:40:46.376 --> 01:40:49.197]  It's not easy, giving up your livelihood for what you believe.
[01:40:49.417 --> 01:40:50.798]  Hey, I'm with you, man.
[01:40:50.818 --> 01:40:52.458]  Listen, keep us updated, Mike.
[01:40:52.498 --> 01:40:53.359]  Give us some emails.
[01:40:53.419 --> 01:40:57.040]  If you can email us the name of the company, maybe we can go over it more next week.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.541]  Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
[01:40:58.581 --> 01:40:59.261]  That's the bottom line.
[01:40:59.281 --> 01:41:00.181]  But we have to stand up.
[01:41:00.201 --> 01:41:00.921]  Stand up and fight.
[01:41:00.961 --> 01:41:01.502]  That's right.
[01:41:01.542 --> 01:41:02.502]  You can't thumbscan.
[01:41:03.222 --> 01:41:06.144]  Listen, you can't just give in because this is your job.
[01:41:06.164 --> 01:41:09.786]  Because the next thing they're going to do is like, oh, we're just going to prick your blood.
[01:41:09.966 --> 01:41:11.407]  We're just going to take your DNA.
[01:41:11.807 --> 01:41:20.372]  Oh, we're just going to put these little off switches on your car so to make sure that if the terrorists get in your car or if it's stolen, we'll be able to shut it down.
[01:41:20.693 --> 01:41:22.554]  Well, how about if you're the terrorist?
[01:41:22.934 --> 01:41:27.417]  If you're the target and you're on the road trying to escape tyranny, they'll just shut it off.
[01:41:27.777 --> 01:41:29.718]  I mean, they want OnStar in every vehicle.
[01:41:29.918 --> 01:41:32.480]  They want a complete command and control system.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:39.084]  That's why the Census Bureau sent their census boards around to GPS every home within 30 yards.
[01:41:39.564 --> 01:41:40.125]  It happened!
[01:41:40.385 --> 01:41:41.665]  It really happened.
[01:41:42.226 --> 01:41:53.493]  Yes, as a matter of fact, a friend of mine that's a census worker, you know, she asked me not to mention her name, but that's exactly what she was telling me is about the GPSing of the doorways to each home in the area that she was working.
[01:41:53.533 --> 01:41:56.415]  So absolutely, I tell you, we are so close to them.
[01:41:56.955 --> 01:41:58.736]  They can cut off the ATMs anytime.
[01:41:58.876 --> 01:42:00.818]  I'm sure they could do that with the gas pumps and all that.
[01:42:01.138 --> 01:42:02.299]  They're just not ready to yet.
[01:42:02.359 --> 01:42:05.761]  We've got this window of opportunity with this big awakening that's happening.
[01:42:05.821 --> 01:42:15.867]  So many people are hurt from the economic devastation that's occurred over the last couple years that we need to actively bring these people in, wake them up, keep them from worrying, and get them involved.
[01:42:16.427 --> 01:42:19.930]  And these thumbscan policies that are going on, it doesn't surprise me a bit.
[01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:24.953]  At some point, we're going to be having to give it up in all the transactions that we do.
[01:42:26.567 --> 01:42:27.448]  It's just a reality.
[01:42:28.329 --> 01:42:29.430]  I wish it wasn't this way.
[01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:33.413]  I wish that I didn't have to come on the air and discuss about real issues.
[01:42:33.453 --> 01:42:35.215]  I wish I was talking sports with everybody.
[01:42:35.355 --> 01:42:36.496]  Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
[01:42:36.576 --> 01:42:36.996]  That's right.
[01:42:37.036 --> 01:42:39.578]  It's time to get off our duffs and take action.
[01:42:39.819 --> 01:42:42.101]  Step up to the plate and try to knock one out of the park.
[01:42:42.121 --> 01:42:43.222]  We'll be back after this.
[01:42:43.542 --> 01:42:44.523]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:44.563 --> 01:42:47.485]  I'm Jason Bermes sitting in InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:52.208 --> 01:42:59.052]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:42:59.192 --> 01:43:00.413]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:43:00.453 --> 01:43:01.133]  It's very real.
[01:43:01.273 --> 01:43:05.015]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:43:05.176 --> 01:43:09.498]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:43:09.638 --> 01:43:12.020]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:18.003]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:43:18.223 --> 01:43:22.947]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:43:23.007 --> 01:43:25.749]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:43:25.829 --> 01:43:28.471]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:43:28.552 --> 01:43:35.737]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:43:36.018 --> 01:43:39.741]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:43:39.761 --> 01:43:39.961]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:43:53.334 --> 01:43:56.998]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:57.359 --> 01:44:00.362]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:00.602 --> 01:44:02.004]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:02.705 --> 01:44:05.386]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:06.146 --> 01:44:11.567]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:11.767 --> 01:44:16.808]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:16.829 --> 01:44:26.931]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:27.071 --> 01:44:29.172]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:29.412 --> 01:44:30.733]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:30.993 --> 01:44:33.274]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:33.454 --> 01:44:35.295]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:35.575 --> 01:44:40.378]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:40.738 --> 01:44:45.500]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.842]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:51.863 --> 01:45:00.928]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[01:45:01.088 --> 01:45:04.430]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[01:45:04.630 --> 01:45:14.076]  Introducing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[01:45:14.216 --> 01:45:19.479]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[01:45:19.759 --> 01:45:21.920]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:33.064]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:35.024]  With absolutely no apologies.
[01:45:35.204 --> 01:45:39.686]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[01:45:39.846 --> 01:45:40.286]  That's right.
[01:45:40.506 --> 01:45:40.866]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:46:01.084 --> 01:46:01.945]  We are back!
[01:46:02.046 --> 01:46:03.588]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:03.648 --> 01:46:04.770]  Alex out on assignment.
[01:46:04.810 --> 01:46:07.433]  I'm Jason Bermas filling in in studio with Richard Reeves.
[01:46:07.493 --> 01:46:15.024]  If you missed any of the program, folks, it is so important to go get the podcast over at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:46:16.326 --> 01:46:25.648]  And listen, as we go over point by point in this bill right here, the Cybersecurity Act, only five dissenters, over 400 congressmen voting this in.
[01:46:25.668 --> 01:46:29.489]  You go to the congressional page where the people are voting on it.
[01:46:29.949 --> 01:46:33.229]  It had less than 6% that were for the bill.
[01:46:33.569 --> 01:46:40.811]  So how is it that we live in a country where our representatives, the representatives of the people, do the complete
[01:46:41.711 --> 01:46:42.171]  Opposite.
[01:46:42.191 --> 01:46:44.573]  And folks, we've got a new iPhone app out there.
[01:46:44.613 --> 01:46:45.333]  It is free.
[01:46:45.573 --> 01:46:49.035]  Do not paper any InfoWars iPhone apps, any Alex Jones iPhone apps.
[01:46:49.376 --> 01:46:56.520]  It is free and it is playing 24-7, 365, Alex Jones, real information.
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:58.281]  Get it to your friends, your family.
[01:46:58.781 --> 01:47:03.884]  Listen, you have a captive audience when you're head of household with your wife and your kids in the car.
[01:47:04.124 --> 01:47:08.707]  When you're on a trip with your friends and you're the one in the driver's seat.
[01:47:09.367 --> 01:47:10.048]  So, you know,
[01:47:10.973 --> 01:47:14.596]  Bless them with real information, with truth.
[01:47:14.716 --> 01:47:15.016]  Richard?
[01:47:15.736 --> 01:47:16.177]  Absolutely.
[01:47:16.197 --> 01:47:17.277]  The iPhone app.
[01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:22.201]  Sign on that if you've got one of those iPhones because if not, at least get an iPod and download the podcast.
[01:47:22.241 --> 01:47:27.604]  It's a wonderful thing to be able to have that type of access and open up and unlock minds.
[01:47:27.644 --> 01:47:29.846]  So I say, by all means, support
[01:47:30.146 --> 01:47:30.266]  Yes.
[01:48:00.166 --> 01:48:08.511]  We actually stopped Rudy Giuliani from becoming the presidential selected candidate for the 08 election in that election.
[01:48:08.771 --> 01:48:13.854]  Rudolph Giuliani was the heir apparent for the Republican nomination.
[01:48:14.234 --> 01:48:17.576]  It was 9-11 truthers that dogged him everywhere he went.
[01:48:17.916 --> 01:48:21.538]  He could not show up in any public venue and not get away from 9-11 truthers.
[01:48:21.958 --> 01:48:23.719]  I predict that's what's going to happen to Glenn Beck.
[01:48:23.959 --> 01:48:28.422]  You're going to rue the day that you came out and made yourself the leader of 9-11 Liars Group.
[01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:29.723]  You're going to be exposed.
[01:48:29.783 --> 01:48:37.527]  And Sarah Palin, the same thing for you, that you're trying to hijack the Tea Party movement, you're trying to hijack the Patriot movement, and it's not going to work.
[01:48:37.927 --> 01:48:40.249]  So lastly, I would want to say, Deborah Medina,
[01:48:40.829 --> 01:48:41.449]  Keep it up.
[01:48:41.730 --> 01:48:42.450]  She's the one.
[01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:45.071]  She's the standard bearer for our movement right now here in Texas.
[01:48:45.432 --> 01:48:48.233]  I would encourage everybody to go to DailyPaul.com.
[01:48:48.613 --> 01:48:52.375]  DailyPaul.com and just search on how you can help Debra Medina win.
[01:48:52.795 --> 01:48:55.777]  Search that in DailyPaul.com, how you can help Debra Medina win.
[01:48:56.097 --> 01:48:57.518]  There's a lot of recommendations there.
[01:48:57.558 --> 01:49:01.020]  There's no way to even lay them all out on a broadcast like this.
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.761]  But folks, Debra Medina can win this race.
[01:49:03.801 --> 01:49:07.203]  There's got to be a million patriots here in Texas if there's one.
[01:49:07.663 --> 01:49:10.425]  And I just know in my heart that we can do this.
[01:49:10.605 --> 01:49:15.109]  And folks, the winning of these elections has to start somewhere, Jason.
[01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:17.931]  It has to start somewhere and nowhere else but in Texas.
[01:49:18.031 --> 01:49:19.672]  Why not right here in Texas?
[01:49:19.953 --> 01:49:25.997]  Because pretty soon all 50 states get patriot governors, state reps, state senators, U.S.
[01:49:26.057 --> 01:49:26.838]  reps, U.S.
[01:49:26.858 --> 01:49:27.158]  senators.
[01:49:27.238 --> 01:49:28.680]  You name them, we need to get them all.
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:32.162]  We need to see a hundred incumbents in the U.S.
[01:49:32.182 --> 01:49:33.083]  House of Representatives.
[01:49:33.183 --> 01:49:35.505]  You're talking about how there's a lack of representation there on this
[01:49:36.505 --> 01:49:44.547]  Let's fire 200 of these guys in these primaries, folks.
[01:49:44.587 --> 01:49:46.068]  Let's do it on both sides of the aisle.
[01:49:46.428 --> 01:49:48.888]  Fire them just as fair and square as we possibly can.
[01:49:48.928 --> 01:49:52.149]  These primaries is the Achilles heel to fire these guys.
[01:49:52.389 --> 01:49:53.929]  Again, we went over Climategate.
[01:49:53.969 --> 01:49:55.430]  We went over the Tea Parties.
[01:49:55.710 --> 01:49:58.431]  We went over the latest police state news.
[01:49:58.671 --> 01:50:03.692]  And we went over, big time, the Cybersecurity Act that has gone through the House.
[01:50:04.392 --> 01:50:08.556]  And unless we do something destined, destined to pass the Senate.
[01:50:08.776 --> 01:50:10.357]  Folks, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:10.457 --> 01:50:11.298]  Please support us.
[01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:12.439]  Make copies of the videos.
[01:50:12.459 --> 01:50:12.919]  Hand them out.
[01:50:13.239 --> 01:50:14.861]  And get the iPhone app!
[01:50:15.181 --> 01:50:16.522]  Get the iPhone app!
[01:50:16.882 --> 01:50:18.123]  Get the iPhone app!
[01:50:18.304 --> 01:50:19.605]  We will be back tomorrow.
[01:50:19.685 --> 01:50:20.646]  God bless you all.
[01:50:34.266 --> 01:50:35.831]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
