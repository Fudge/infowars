[00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:08.826]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.506 --> 00:00:10.307]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.088 --> 00:00:12.029]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.313]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:20.917]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:29.745]  Thank you for joining us for the first live broadcast of 2010, the first live weekday transmission.
[00:00:30.612 --> 00:00:33.615]  We kicked it off yesterday with the abbreviated Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:40.822]  than I do every Sunday, because we're in a war for Western civilization, a war for liberty and freedom.
[00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:46.147]  Private offshore interests, the United Nations and others, are openly setting up world government.
[00:00:46.952 --> 00:00:50.476]  Lord Christopher Monckton, of course, was the top advisor to Margaret Thatcher.
[00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:57.522]  He has an international consulting firm on scientific and corporate issues to governments and Fortune 500.
[00:00:57.803 --> 00:01:01.506]  He, of course, is an award-winning journalist in his own right.
[00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:03.468]  His bio goes on and on.
[00:01:03.508 --> 00:01:07.232]  We'll give you his website several times before he leaves us today.
[00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:09.774]  He's with us graciously for the next hour.
[00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:38.136]  He, with stunning accuracy, and you know I don't say that for most guests, unless it's warranted and due, but I want to single out his accuracy so that people pay particular heed today, with exactly the slogans, exactly the nomenclature, exactly what would happen at Copenhagen, how they would, even if it failed, still have the bureaucracy try to implement it, which Gordon Brown has announced treacherously against the free republics of the world.
[00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:57.712]  And so he joins us to talk about what really happened at Copenhagen, what this new system is by the industrialized world saying they're going to monitor nation's carbon footprint and go ahead and start levying the taxes and doling out Western taxpayer money from Europe, England and the United States.
[00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:07.088]  And then we're going to move into the latest on ClimateGate and how these fraudsters are still trying to take over at the local level.
[00:02:07.368 --> 00:02:09.849]  Here in the U.S., taxes on TVs at the state level.
[00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.990]  In many states, taxes on plastic bags, home inspections.
[00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.851]  The U.N.
[00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:23.135]  has announced with Schwarzenegger, governor's conferences, mayor conferences, doling out money for cities to implement this, circumventing the federal government.
[00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:25.596]  Working with foreign powers.
[00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:28.078]  This is completely illegal and unconstitutional.
[00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:29.879]  And is an act of sedition.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.241]  So we're going to break here in just a few minutes and come back in a long segment.
[00:02:33.602 --> 00:02:36.624]  But I want to introduce Lord Christopher Monckton.
[00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:37.925]  Sir, great to have you here with us.
[00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:40.927]  Well Alex, it's a real pleasure once again to be with you.
[00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.248]  And you're quite right.
[00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:49.973]  The usual suspects are still doing their best after the quite spectacular failure of the Copenhagen conference.
[00:02:50.453 --> 00:03:11.658]  To try and turn it into what, in their terms, is a success by setting up a so-called high-level panel, which is, if you like, the kind of stub of the world government they had hoped to grow, and they will hope to start transferring your money and mine to that high-level panel, along with the Copenhagen Green Fund.
[00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:15.079]  It's actually called the Copenhagen Green Fund.
[00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.001]  No longer any pretence of political objectivity.
[00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:30.368]  We're now in among the reds who call themselves green, the watermelons, and they are now named as the Green Fund, which is going to be the recipient of all this money that we're going to pay.
[00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:39.734]  The United States in particular has said it's going to contribute really enormous sums of money, your money, to this Green Fund.
[00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:49.264]  And what it's really going to be used for, of course, is not to help the poorer countries of the world to adapt to climate change, because there's nothing to adapt to.
[00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:54.791]  It will be spent instead on setting up and growing the expensive, corrupt
[00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:19.671]  central government bureaucracy of the new very left-wing, virtually Marxist world government, which the likes of Gordon Brown and Obama and Kevin Rudd in Australia would so very much like to see, and which the countries like China and Russia, of course, who are also inclined in that authoritarian, totalitarian direction, are also inclined to follow.
[00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:20.832]  Lord Montyn!
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.900]  We've got a break.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.061]  Come back right there.
[00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:46.341]  Sorry to cut you off.
[00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:51.943]  We have the third Viscount of Brenchley and Moncton, Lord Christopher Moncton, is our guest.
[00:04:51.963 --> 00:04:52.803]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:58.005]  He'll be right back as he gives us a worldwide briefing on what these criminals are up to.
[00:04:59.721 --> 00:05:03.963]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:08.346]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:14.029]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:14.809]  It's true.
[00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:19.652]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:20.513]  Number 3.
[00:05:20.793 --> 00:05:24.076]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:28.079]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.840]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.462]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:31.843 --> 00:05:35.246]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:35.746]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.327 --> 00:05:40.250]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:45.235]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:49.540]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.242]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.482 --> 00:05:53.565]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:56.068]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:13.582]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:14.302 --> 00:06:18.343]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:18.923 --> 00:06:29.745]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:39.389]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.951]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:52.515]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:52.815 --> 00:06:55.556]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:04.367]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:07.710]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.734]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:07:12.754 --> 00:07:19.020]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:21.403]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:22.203]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:22.223 --> 00:07:22.644]  Bernanke?
[00:07:22.724 --> 00:07:23.505]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:24.666]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:24.686 --> 00:07:26.928]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:40.742 --> 00:07:41.262]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:07.362]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.103 --> 00:08:09.204]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.845 --> 00:08:10.665]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.426 --> 00:08:12.367]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:16.671]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.192 --> 00:08:21.296]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.797 --> 00:08:28.443]  The third Viscount of Moncton and Brentialee, Christopher Moncton, is our guest.
[00:08:29.727 --> 00:08:43.960]  If you had to single one person out as the general or the George Washington of this fight against the climate criminals, the scaremongers who know it's a fraud that want to tax and control all facets of life.
[00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:46.410]  It's Lord Christopher Monckton.
[00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:56.378]  He is the main champion, the focal point articulating the facts, predicting the enemy's movements, and giving us the intel to devastate their operations.
[00:08:56.418 --> 00:09:04.065]  We've had a major victory at Copenhagen in this engagement, likening it to a naval engagement, but the enemy's main fleet
[00:09:04.725 --> 00:09:18.708]  is remassing to launch more attacks circumnavigating the federal governments of the planet, going directly to the states, the counties, the cities, Schwarzenegger leading that treacherous charge here in the United States.
[00:09:19.049 --> 00:09:32.792]  They're also having the bureaucracies of England and the European Union and the United States ignore the people and ignore the UN wanted this treaty, wanted everybody to sign over and sign their rights over to world government and all these new taxes.
[00:09:33.232 --> 00:09:39.636]  They couldn't and so now they're creating the Global Fund, the Green Fund, to go buy off government, shut down their development.
[00:09:39.897 --> 00:09:44.059]  Maury Strong and others can suck more money out like they did with the Oil for Food program.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:50.864]  So sir, breaking down what really happened at Copenhagen, the dragon wounded but not
[00:09:51.444 --> 00:09:58.208]  Well, Alex, I'm going to continue with your military metaphor, and I'm going to take a kind of three-minute time-out, because I'm going to recite to you now
[00:10:19.634 --> 00:10:28.517]  An address which was given by Abraham Lincoln in a reedy voice, holding the paper very close to his face, on the battlefield of Gettysburg.
[00:10:28.557 --> 00:10:29.417]  This is what he said.
[00:10:30.178 --> 00:10:42.062]  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
[00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:45.983]  Now we are engaged in a great civil war.
[00:10:46.727 --> 00:10:53.028]  Testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.
[00:10:53.728 --> 00:10:56.609]  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
[00:10:56.769 --> 00:11:05.530]  We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
[00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.531]  It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
[00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:15.292]  But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
[00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:23.675]  The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far beyond our poor power to add or detract.
[00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:31.302]  The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
[00:11:31.822 --> 00:11:40.870]  It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
[00:11:41.624 --> 00:11:55.029]  It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honoured dead we take increased devotion for that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.
[00:11:55.589 --> 00:12:10.594]  That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
[00:12:11.235 --> 00:12:15.057]  ...for the people shall not perish from the earth.
[00:12:16.258 --> 00:12:19.939]  Now that's what he said, and that's what I want to talk about now.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:26.583]  Because let us suppose that there is a case for doing something about the climate.
[00:12:26.683 --> 00:12:28.204]  There isn't, but let's pretend there is.
[00:12:28.704 --> 00:12:32.386]  Let's suppose that even if there was a scientific case, there was an economic case.
[00:12:32.526 --> 00:12:34.567]  There isn't, but let's pretend that there is.
[00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:55.859]  If we're going to have multilateral action, if we're going to have a global government, then honouring what it was that those gallant men at Gettysburg died for, we want to make sure that that government shall be a government of the people, by the people, for the people.
[00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:58.661]  It should be an elected government.
[00:12:59.281 --> 00:13:03.324]  And I think that what I would like everyone who is listening today to do
[00:13:04.324 --> 00:13:33.287]  is to get in touch by telephone with their elected representatives, both in Congress and your Senators, both your Senators, and say that if we are to go any further whatsoever towards paying taxpayers' money towards this high-level panel or this Copenhagen Green Fund, these first steps towards what would have been a much grander world government unless we'd stopped it at Copenhagen, but it may still come to that.
[00:13:33.826 --> 00:13:48.811]  We want to make sure that if there's going to be a world government, it should be an elected world government, elected by the people of the world and not appointed by the bureaucrats of the world, as is at present intended.
[00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:52.272]  Now, I put it to you, Alex, that that is a sensible point.
[00:13:52.992 --> 00:14:02.835]  We're saying if there is a problem with the climate, which you and I don't believe there is, if there is an economic solution to it, which you and I don't think there is,
[00:14:03.459 --> 00:14:19.668]  If we must have a global government, which you and I don't think we should have, then I'm sure that everybody who is a true American and a follower of Lincoln will admit that that is to be an elected government and not an appointed one.
[00:14:19.688 --> 00:14:29.634]  And so what we've got to do is stop this step-by-step, crab-wise approach towards global government, which is what they're now going to try to do.
[00:14:30.273 --> 00:14:41.620]  Because so many of your listeners, Alex, got onto their Senators before and said the Treaty of Copenhagen in its original draft, which I warned you about in the World Government Presence, shall not pass.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.621]  We will not have it.
[00:14:43.141 --> 00:14:50.085]  So many of you actually did that, that the Democrat Senators in particular got in touch with President Obama and said, we can't have this.
[00:14:50.225 --> 00:14:51.066]  We're not having it.
[00:14:51.306 --> 00:14:52.407]  We'll never get it through.
[00:14:52.627 --> 00:14:57.750]  We'll never be voted for again if we throw away the democracy for which
[00:14:58.274 --> 00:15:02.515]  Our people at Gettysburg died and our people are still dying for it.
[00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:07.517]  Our gallant troops now, yours and ours, in Afghanistan and in Iraq.
[00:15:08.417 --> 00:15:11.759]  And these lives must not be thrown away in vain.
[00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:15.360]  Government of the people, by the people, for the people.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.841]  That is what the United States is all about.
[00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:24.843]  And any administration that tries to transfer power away
[00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:33.464]  No sir, and I've noticed you have a great knowledge of our system of government here, but being a lord in your system of government in
[00:15:55.202 --> 00:16:20.880]  Your system, when you have Gordon Brown saying, I don't care if the nations didn't sign on to this, I'm setting up this fund and we'll now have Europe, the UK and the United States and Canada, New Zealand, Australia and others, he calls them the commonwealths, sign on to this and start putting money into what he and others have called global governance, global government.
[00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.731]  I mean, that is open tyranny.
[00:16:24.372 --> 00:16:27.754]  So can you speak to that specifically under your law and our law?
[00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:44.786]  And then to have Schwarzenegger, I know you were there so you're aware of it, all over the news saying, well, I'm just going to have a governor's conference meet, that he's calling himself, and I'm going to have a group of mayors meet, and we're going to implement this taxation system even if the Senate won't.
[00:16:44.906 --> 00:16:47.048]  And a week before Copenhagen ended,
[00:16:47.856 --> 00:16:59.662]  You said they may not get this through, but they are still going to try to implement it through the bureaucracy and through the local governments, so the federal bureaucracies and the local governments.
[00:16:59.982 --> 00:17:09.627]  I mean, is that not glaring sedition to have some usurping foreign-born governor running around organizing the states
[00:17:10.967 --> 00:17:20.031]  And then to have Obama, who can't get the Senate to pass it, it looks like, just saying he'll just take money from the Treasury and serve it up to Ban Ki-moon and Maury Strong.
[00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:25.173]  I mean, it's just outrageously, openly fraudulent and criminal.
[00:17:25.954 --> 00:17:38.319]  Well, certainly under our Constitution, such as it is, and we don't have a written one like you, no money can be handed away by the government to anyone unless Parliament has authorized it.
[00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.793]  Now the trouble is, at the moment, that our Parliament is a lot of poodles.
[00:17:44.353 --> 00:17:50.197]  And they, on both the major parties, at all three of them, the bigger parties, all believe in this climate nonsense.
[00:17:50.597 --> 00:18:01.664]  And if Gordon Brown says to them, never mind that our own people are starving and going bust at a record rate, we must give their money away to save the planet from this non-problem of the climate.
[00:18:01.944 --> 00:18:06.507]  Unfortunately, I think it's quite likely that in any budget in which he writes such a provision in,
[00:18:07.063 --> 00:18:16.575]  Our Parliament would probably be like a poodle and just vote for it at the moment because reality has not yet broken through among our governing class here.
[00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:23.904]  Now in the United States, I'm less familiar with exactly what powers the President has under his executive authority
[00:18:24.298 --> 00:18:29.202]  To allocate money from the Treasury or the Fed to whatever project he fancies.
[00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:30.443]  But I think I'm right.
[00:18:30.663 --> 00:18:32.305]  Sir, it's totally illegal.
[00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:34.707]  He can't do it and Congress is already saying that.
[00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:43.294]  Eighteen, it was fourteen now, eighteen Attorney Generals are saying they may file suit over not just that but his health care.
[00:18:43.314 --> 00:18:45.776]  I mean, everything he's doing is unconstitutional.
[00:18:46.336 --> 00:18:48.918]  I think this often happens on the left these days.
[00:18:49.018 --> 00:18:53.262]  He knows, Obama knows from his plummeting ratings in the opinion poll
[00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.474]  But he's not long for this world.
[00:18:55.894 --> 00:19:05.264]  He will be a lame duck president from this December, once the mid-term elections for the entire House of Representatives, as well as the 30% have been held.
[00:19:05.484 --> 00:19:06.485]  He knows this now.
[00:19:06.925 --> 00:19:15.754]  And so, in panic, he is trying to do what the left always do, which is pay no attention to the Constitution, use taxpayers' money to fund his friends
[00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:16.745]  I think?
[00:19:40.822 --> 00:19:42.903]  Got to hold it there, Lord Monckton.
[00:19:43.023 --> 00:19:44.104]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.178 --> 00:20:02.479]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:06.361]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:14.326]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together, and food is always the expression of our shared love and care.
[00:20:19.116 --> 00:20:19.416]  That's right.
[00:20:36.025 --> 00:20:44.970]  This holiday special is designed to bring peace and security to you and yours, and comes with a free 7-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate.
[00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.911]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:20:46.931 --> 00:20:47.611]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:20:47.731 --> 00:20:51.293]  We here at eFoodsDirect wish you peace, security, and plenty this holiday season.
[00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:03.940]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.322]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[00:21:08.442 --> 00:21:09.803]  You get less for your money.
[00:21:10.023 --> 00:21:15.846]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at MIDAS Resources.
[00:21:16.926 --> 00:21:17.486]  Thank you.
[00:21:40.316 --> 00:21:40.776]  We're good.
[00:22:01.565 --> 00:22:05.191]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.612 --> 00:22:08.577]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.837 --> 00:22:10.240]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:22:10.948 --> 00:22:13.611]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:19.876]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.016 --> 00:22:25.061]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:35.190]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.411]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.651 --> 00:22:38.991]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.231 --> 00:22:41.572]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.692 --> 00:22:43.532]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.552 --> 00:22:48.634]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:48.974 --> 00:22:58.077]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:00.086 --> 00:23:03.268]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.629 --> 00:23:05.470]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:06.331]  Don't!
[00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:09.813]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.233 --> 00:23:19.000]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.023]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:26.085]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:23:26.525 --> 00:23:33.553]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:34.874]  Herb K. was right.
[00:23:35.074 --> 00:23:38.158]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.278 --> 00:23:39.279]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:39.619 --> 00:23:42.763]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:23:43.323 --> 00:23:46.985]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:47.605]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:48.105]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:48.165]  888-352-7726.
[00:24:05.876 --> 00:24:09.197]  Monday through Friday from 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:24:09.378 --> 00:24:11.719]  Eastern, we are here live.
[00:24:11.739 --> 00:24:15.520]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:21.183]  Our guest website is ScienceAndPublicPolicy.org.
[00:24:21.763 --> 00:24:30.507]  We're also streaming the radio show via video at PrisonPlanet.tv, and we have the website up on screen, ScienceAndPublicPolicy.org.
[00:24:30.627 --> 00:24:32.848]  Lord Christopher Monckton is our guest.
[00:24:33.328 --> 00:24:59.250]  Okay, I've had a lot of my questions, and I want to get into the latest on Climategate, but I think the overwhelming point you've made here is, we've had a giant victory, and we can feel the momentum shifting in our direction, but still, the hundreds of billions globally invested in the fraud, in the global government, in the taxation scheme, as the foundation of this illegal, unelected global government, they're not going to stop, they're going to keep pushing, though badly damaged,
[00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:06.151]  And so it's up to the people to contact their senators, their representatives, their state leaders, and say no, no, no.
[00:25:06.992 --> 00:25:08.472]  Please continue, Lord Monckton.
[00:25:08.512 --> 00:25:12.633]  Then let's get into Climategate, the latest developments there.
[00:25:13.073 --> 00:25:13.233]  Yep.
[00:25:13.573 --> 00:25:28.276]  First of all, just to get the point of what you need to say now when you talk to your representative, say that if there must be any kind of global government, it must be elected by the peoples of the world and not appointed by government or by bureaucrats.
[00:25:28.675 --> 00:25:29.976]  It's got to be elected.
[00:25:30.516 --> 00:25:32.697]  And that will stop the nonsense faster than anything.
[00:25:33.317 --> 00:25:36.678]  So now, on to the latest on Climategate.
[00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:45.582]  I've now heard from the Chairman of the Independent Inquiry into Climategate, because I wrote to him and said, look, I want to give evidence of this.
[00:25:46.082 --> 00:25:50.384]  He says that he's just about to appoint a team to look at who's going to give evidence and who isn't.
[00:25:50.764 --> 00:25:52.345]  And at that point, they'll get back to me.
[00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:54.166]  So that is slowly happening.
[00:25:54.873 --> 00:26:19.923]  More interestingly, arising out of climate change, there is now a general mood in the air that those who have been peddling this climate scare for so long, and who have quite wrongly claimed the moral high ground, are now losing it, not only because the science doesn't work out, not only because there's no economic case even if the science does work out, not only because even if we had to have
[00:26:22.235 --> 00:26:24.916]  We don't need a global government to do it.
[00:26:25.276 --> 00:26:31.257]  Not even because even if we do have a global government, it must be an elected global government, and at the moment they're planning not to.
[00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:46.421]  But the reason why they've lost the moral authority, above all else, is that it is becoming apparent that you are quite right, Alex, when you use words like criminal and fraud about what's going on.
[00:26:47.262 --> 00:26:58.291]  And for instance, the chairman of the IPCC Science Panel, Dr Rajendra Pachauri, when I was in Copenhagen, I went to hear him give a lecture.
[00:26:59.312 --> 00:27:03.695]  And it was a lecture on why it is that the climate is all terrible and we've got to do something about it.
[00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:15.544]  And I knew that he would use, and he duly did use, a bogus graph that appears three times, large and in full colour, in the latest UN document published in 2007.
[00:27:18.173 --> 00:27:31.583]  An entirely bogus graph which was created using a false and well-known false and fraudulent statistical technique to try to pretend, quite falsely, that the rate of warming is itself increasing.
[00:27:31.643 --> 00:27:46.695]  And I confronted him as he arrived at that lecture and handed him a detailed letter from me explaining what was wrong with this graph, telling him not to use it and asking him to get back to me within 48 hours to say that that graph would no longer be used
[00:27:47.037 --> 00:27:52.938]  Either by him or by the IPCC, and that this kind of fraud would in future be desisted from.
[00:27:53.298 --> 00:28:03.240]  I also raised the question at the end of his speech, having seen him use the graph, saying, look, you've used it again, and this is a bogus graph, and I'm going to give you 48 hours to get back to me.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.001]  He didn't get back to me, of course, in 48 hours.
[00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:16.743]  And I am now reporting it to the police in India for scientific and financial fraud, because he has a large
[00:28:17.116 --> 00:28:29.643]  Sir, to interrupt you, you were saying a year ago that he was involved.
[00:28:29.683 --> 00:28:39.168]  It's finally all over British and US papers that they're shutting down famous steel plants in England to open them up in India when he's one of the big owners.
[00:28:39.949 --> 00:28:41.990]  That's right, and he's making money out of that.
[00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.072]  We've lost 1700 jobs in the north of England just in the last month.
[00:28:46.607 --> 00:28:46.987]  Outrageous!
[00:29:16.118 --> 00:29:19.762]  Now, British are paying to lose their jobs.
[00:29:20.223 --> 00:29:20.684]  That's right.
[00:29:20.784 --> 00:29:33.179]  We are paying Pachauri, personally, to take 1,700 of our workers' jobs and transfer, not the workers, just jobs, to India, where he will make money again.
[00:29:33.792 --> 00:29:39.676]  By various credit under the Clean Development Mechanism, which is one of the boondogs run by the U.N.
[00:29:39.916 --> 00:29:40.676]  It's unbelievable.
[00:29:41.096 --> 00:29:41.797]  Gotta break again.
[00:29:41.857 --> 00:29:42.897]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:42.917 --> 00:29:47.980]  Let's go into some more fraud, like Al Gore saying the ice caps will all melt in three to seven years.
[00:29:48.241 --> 00:29:48.981]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.382 --> 00:29:51.322]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.783 --> 00:29:53.404]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.324 --> 00:29:57.006]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.353 --> 00:30:02.975]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.375 --> 00:30:08.338]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:08.698 --> 00:30:10.439]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:10.739 --> 00:30:15.562]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:15.743 --> 00:30:16.703]  How much do you want?
[00:30:16.923 --> 00:30:17.684]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.064 --> 00:30:19.665]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:19.945 --> 00:30:20.766]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.026 --> 00:30:23.087]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.227 --> 00:30:24.328]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.568 --> 00:30:25.869]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.089 --> 00:30:31.154]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.335 --> 00:30:34.538]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:38.422]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:38.743 --> 00:30:39.744]  How much will you need?
[00:30:39.984 --> 00:30:40.585]  We don't know.
[00:30:40.885 --> 00:30:41.786]  How much do you want?
[00:30:41.986 --> 00:30:42.727]  All you can get.
[00:30:42.927 --> 00:30:43.728]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:43.988 --> 00:30:46.771]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:30:59.707 --> 00:31:00.687]  What's your home worth?
[00:31:00.867 --> 00:31:02.808]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:31:02.968 --> 00:31:05.729]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:13.531]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:31:59.141 --> 00:32:06.009]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:07.370]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.071]  It's very real.
[00:32:08.211 --> 00:32:10.334]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:32:10.454 --> 00:32:11.976]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:33:23.339 --> 00:33:24.299]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.701]  Science and public policy, all one word.
[00:33:29.161 --> 00:33:30.802]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[00:33:30.822 --> 00:33:41.707]  We're going back to Lord Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount of Monckton and Brinsley, the leading voice in the fight against the foundation of world government.
[00:33:42.347 --> 00:33:45.249]  The Climate Cult, which Al Gore admits will be a new religion.
[00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:47.230]  We're going back to him in just a moment.
[00:33:47.490 --> 00:34:04.300]  If you want to understand these people and see the UN's own documents, their own statements, understand what they will set up if they're successful, a total eco-tyranny of collectivism, transferring our money to these criminal bureaucrats, you need to get my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, on DVD.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:10.844]  You can get this film free for a limited time when you order my newest film, over two hours long.
[00:34:11.944 --> 00:34:13.105]  All right.
[00:34:29.454 --> 00:34:30.094]  I don't know.
[00:34:45.293 --> 00:34:47.594]  It will end January 15th.
[00:34:48.054 --> 00:34:52.137]  You can get five and a half months free right now and watch the simulcast of the radio show.
[00:34:52.317 --> 00:35:03.503]  The radio show is obviously free on AM and FM, shortwave satellite, but the streaming video, 15 cents a day, or if you get the five plus months free, it's even less than 15 cents a day, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:03.823 --> 00:35:09.346]  You can download the high-quality video archives, share them with friends, you name it, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:10.326 --> 00:35:11.767]  Okay, Lord Monkin, long segment.
[00:35:11.788 --> 00:35:15.971]  Sorry for the breaks and erupting your statements there.
[00:35:16.572 --> 00:35:31.464]  We were getting into fraud and the head of the IPCC openly profiting with Gordon Brown paying taxpayer money to shut down ancient high-quality jobs, jobs that have been there for a long time, to ship them there for his profit.
[00:35:31.865 --> 00:35:36.369]  Now there's so many other instances and there's the classic ClimateGate emails, Ben Santer,
[00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:39.371]  Three weeks ago, the interview aired on TruTV.
[00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:55.804]  Top ratings for that show, by the way, number one show on TruTV, showing the interest where Ben Santer admits, finally admitting what you exposed years ago, that he removed five separate sections from the UN IPCC report on man-made global warming, where their own scientist said man wasn't doing it.
[00:35:56.084 --> 00:36:00.808]  Perhaps we should revisit that and more of where ClimateGate is right now.
[00:36:00.868 --> 00:36:01.409]  Lord Monckton.
[00:36:02.114 --> 00:36:03.355]  Right, well that's quite an agenda.
[00:36:03.395 --> 00:36:06.237]  Let's finish off on Dr Pachauri, shall we?
[00:36:06.917 --> 00:36:27.392]  The other thing I've done is to report him to the British Charity Commission with a request that they should pass on the details to the police because he runs, along with Crispin Tickell and Sir John Horton, who is the former chairman of the IPCC, a charity called TERI Europe.
[00:36:27.532 --> 00:36:30.714]  That is the Energy Research Institute Europe.
[00:36:31.181 --> 00:36:49.393]  Founded originally by Tata Steel Industries, and of course it's Tata Steel which happens to be taking over this steelworks and shutting it down in the UK and opening it in India to make more profit twice over out of our subsidies and destroying 1700 of our jobs.
[00:36:49.713 --> 00:36:57.138]  Well this man Pachauri, because these jobs have been destroyed, I'm now having a very close look at him and what he's doing to our people.
[00:36:57.682 --> 00:37:13.372]  And I discovered he'd set up this charity along with the former chairman of the IPCC, the UN's climate panel, John Thornton, and that charity in each of the last three years has declared income of only 7 or 8 thousand sterling.
[00:37:13.412 --> 00:37:18.135]  In fact, in the last four years added together, less than 25 thousand sterling.
[00:37:18.675 --> 00:37:24.579]  And yet, on the website of the Department of the Environment here, a government department,
[00:37:25.288 --> 00:37:44.223]  I have found a grant of £30,714 just in one year 2006-2007 to the Tata Energy Research Institute Europe, this charity which has declared only £25,000 of income in total over four years.
[00:37:44.623 --> 00:37:51.609]  On one grant, on one of its projects, it has received more than the money it declared for four years.
[00:37:52.029 --> 00:37:54.431]  Now that is false accounting.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.483]  And I have asked for an explanation from the Charities Commission.
[00:37:58.543 --> 00:38:03.987]  There may be, and let's be fair, an innocent explanation, but I'm blowed if I can see one.
[00:38:04.488 --> 00:38:10.813]  And what I think is building up here is a sense that these people thought that they had become above the law.
[00:38:11.153 --> 00:38:24.024]  They thought they'd got the mainstream media where they wanted them, that nobody would ask any questions about any of this, that they could do what they liked with British people's jobs, American people's jobs, there's just been a large American
[00:38:24.754 --> 00:38:31.698]  Um, aluminum smelter closed down again, about two and a half thousand jobs destroyed overnight.
[00:38:31.859 --> 00:38:32.259]  Why?
[00:38:32.879 --> 00:38:39.343]  Because the company that ran it can no longer find anyone to sell it electricity to run the smelter.
[00:38:39.824 --> 00:38:41.985]  Because aluminum smelting takes a lot of electricity.
[00:38:42.629 --> 00:38:57.882]  And because the Greenies and the environmental Marxists have gone around banning the building of new coal-fired power stations, and also stopping nuclear ones being built, America is running out of the energy that is needed to safeguard jobs.
[00:38:58.342 --> 00:39:11.093]  So it's happening in America, major closures, it's happening in Britain, major closures, major losses of jobs directly attributable to this financial and scientific fraud, for that is what it now is.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.160]  Yes.
[00:39:28.852 --> 00:39:32.933]  Not complied with the Freedom of Information Act when other scientists asked for information?
[00:39:33.113 --> 00:39:41.515]  That's bad enough, heaven knows, in a matter where they're about to spend trillions on the data of these scientists, whose work we can't check because they won't give us their data.
[00:39:41.955 --> 00:39:54.598]  But, on top of that, I have now written to the chairman of this inquiry who's been appointed, and I've said, look, mate, there is a large scientific and financial fraud underlying all this.
[00:39:55.091 --> 00:40:19.285]  And since I am named in these Climategate emails, because they don't like me very much, as you can imagine, these nasty scientists who are trying to undermine the world with their bogus science, I've said since they've named me, in very uncomplimentary terms, in these emails, I want the right of reply by having the right to explain to the inquiry why I say that it is.
[00:40:20.007 --> 00:40:36.517]  A financial and scientific fraud and I'm going to produce all the evidence I've built up of what these particular people who are named in the Climategate emails as writing to each other in furtherance of this fraud, I'm going to show what they've done over the years.
[00:40:36.998 --> 00:40:42.261]  I gave a presentation on this in Copenhagen and you should have seen the jaws dropping all around the room.
[00:40:42.682 --> 00:40:45.463]  As I said, I've been following all these people for years.
[00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:48.283]  I've been watching them committing scientific fraud.
[00:40:48.543 --> 00:40:50.703]  I've suspected all along that they were linked.
[00:40:51.144 --> 00:40:55.684]  And now we have the evidence, thanks to the Climategate whistleblower, showing that they are linked.
[00:40:56.024 --> 00:40:59.545]  This is an organized conspiracy of not very many people.
[00:40:59.565 --> 00:41:03.726]  You know, it's not as though we're talking of thousands of scientists in this conspiracy.
[00:41:03.926 --> 00:41:04.686]  It's about two dozen.
[00:41:04.706 --> 00:41:05.646]  Lord Longton!
[00:41:05.666 --> 00:41:11.027]  And they've effectively driven the whole show by being absolutely vicious.
[00:41:11.567 --> 00:41:13.709]  To any scientist who dared to disagree with them.
[00:41:13.969 --> 00:41:24.219]  They've had scientists sacked from their jobs, they've had them threatened, they've had them bullied, they've denied access to the peer-reviewed journals to them, they've stopped them getting their material into the UN's climate report.
[00:41:24.619 --> 00:41:37.531]  These people have been driving this scare and they have been so nasty that they've terrified ordinary scientists who aren't very political and aren't very strong-willed into silence.
[00:41:37.944 --> 00:41:38.125]  And then?
[00:41:48.086 --> 00:41:48.687]  Lord Monckton.
[00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:58.355]  And then when they, scientists, 31,000 did try to testify last year in Congress, they were blocked from being able to testify, even though they've been persecuted.
[00:41:58.415 --> 00:42:09.564]  But expanding on that, I saw a number in the BBC just a month ago of China opening a new cold-powered plant every two and a half days.
[00:42:10.104 --> 00:42:14.868]  And right here in Texas, in East Texas, I have some family land and family that lives there.
[00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:30.778]  And they were going to build a new clean burning coal plant to power several new factories that we're going to be moving in and none of that happened because local environmentalists under green funding from the UN and the federal government
[00:42:31.138 --> 00:42:31.978]  We're good to go.
[00:42:48.623 --> 00:42:49.543]  We see Al Gore.
[00:42:49.584 --> 00:42:50.484]  We see the government.
[00:42:50.704 --> 00:42:51.784]  We see Maury Strong.
[00:42:51.844 --> 00:42:53.485]  We see George Soros.
[00:42:53.925 --> 00:43:06.330]  They control, and you've spoken about this, but if you can elaborate briefly, about how they get to decide where the federal money goes for new energy, and it's always invested with their companies that they make profits from.
[00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.731]  I mean, this isn't just them trying to set up a global government and tax system.
[00:43:10.411 --> 00:43:23.160]  It's a new dark age where they are the only people that get a letter of marker license from this new imperial crown of the UN to be able to even engage in any type of manufacturing.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:31.065]  And of course what is egregiously terrifying about all this is that you quite rightly laid stress on the fact that the 157th
[00:43:32.952 --> 00:43:33.753]  I don't know.
[00:43:52.681 --> 00:43:57.882]  These people are saying that you can't build these coal-fired plants here.
[00:43:58.122 --> 00:44:02.423]  So what's happening is China is building them over in China.
[00:44:02.503 --> 00:44:03.243]  How do we know?
[00:44:03.523 --> 00:44:11.965]  Because the Chinese administration publishes every year what's called the annual statistical communique of the People's Republic of China.
[00:44:12.205 --> 00:44:18.986]  And in that communique they said two years ago they were going to continue regardless of what the UN said, and they were going to build
[00:44:19.873 --> 00:44:25.295]  One or two coal-fired power plants every week for the foreseeable future.
[00:44:25.455 --> 00:44:26.175]  Every week!
[00:44:26.595 --> 00:44:36.738]  It means that in one year they will have built almost as many coal-fired plants as the environmentalists have stopped being built in the United States for the last ten years.
[00:44:36.959 --> 00:44:37.399]  Lord Monckton!
[00:44:37.419 --> 00:44:41.780]  And those are dirty, dirty plants burning dirty coal with huge pollutants.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:47.442]  The Asian brown haze is the only artifact of man that can be seen from space during the day.
[00:44:49.275 --> 00:45:06.170]  Absolutely, and again, is this not economic espionage where Maury Strong and the Rockefellers and others openly are the bigger investors in China, they're all making money, there's no environmental standards, and they're trying to de-industrialize the United States as Maury Strong has stated.
[00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:12.091]  They're doing this to England, they're doing this to Europe, making Europe completely dependent on Russian natural gas.
[00:45:12.471 --> 00:45:20.353]  I mean, this is just, the more you look at this crime, it's so diabolical, it's so multifaceted, it's so incredibly evil.
[00:45:20.873 --> 00:45:22.414]  How do we stop this fraud?
[00:45:23.194 --> 00:45:25.795]  I think what you do is do exactly what you're doing now.
[00:45:25.875 --> 00:45:30.976]  You tell the people of the United States that it is happening, and in the end, they won't tolerate it.
[00:45:30.996 --> 00:45:34.837]  Let me give you just one example, picking up on your point there about the natural gas.
[00:45:36.909 --> 00:45:50.139]  Every day, in the North Slope of Alaska, where there is an oil field, they flare off enough natural gas to supply the whole of Western Europe.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:46:04.530]  Now, if it were not for these, again, these environmentalists, who have stopped that gas pipeline from being built from the North Slope down to the ice-free ports of Southern Alaska, across Alaska,
[00:46:05.094 --> 00:46:23.714]  If that pipeline had been allowed, then I could send four large supertankers every day to Anchorage, let's say, pick up the gas from there, sail it to Grangemouth, plug it into the European gas network there, and I could supply the whole of Europe.
[00:46:24.247 --> 00:46:31.689]  On gas, which at the moment is being burnt to the atmosphere, creating enormous outputs of CO2, which is what they say they're worried about.
[00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:33.049]  Well, at least something good happens.
[00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:34.189]  In the north slope of Alaska.
[00:46:34.429 --> 00:46:36.490]  That is how mad all of this is.
[00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:41.171]  It's not just that it's bad, which it is, and all these people making fortunes.
[00:46:41.291 --> 00:46:43.792]  I mean, there's the mentioned Rothschild, for instance.
[00:46:44.212 --> 00:46:47.993]  He's just opened a huge gold mine in Russia.
[00:46:48.013 --> 00:46:49.653]  He's making, oh, you're making
[00:46:50.302 --> 00:46:52.324]  Millions and millions and millions out of it.
[00:46:52.544 --> 00:46:53.404]  And they're all doing it.
[00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:55.586]  I mean, in some ways, good luck to them.
[00:46:55.606 --> 00:46:56.867]  It's good that they're making money.
[00:46:57.127 --> 00:47:17.141]  But what they're also doing is using their financial power to lobby against innocent businesses in the United States, such as that aluminum smelter, such as all these coal-fired power stations and nuclear-fired power stations that are so necessary, lobbying against the building of the gas pipeline that could liberate Europe from Russian gas.
[00:47:18.195 --> 00:47:23.997]  This is monopoly capitalism.
[00:47:24.638 --> 00:47:26.098]  This is monopoly capitalism.
[00:47:26.138 --> 00:47:34.902]  Well, we're running out of time here, and I know there's so many other important points that you can relay to our audience, Lord Monckton.
[00:47:35.082 --> 00:47:46.446]  If the pendulum's swinging against these people, and the public's now beginning to learn some of the magnitude, not even the full magnitude of the fraud, where do we go from here?
[00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:47.584]  Right.
[00:47:47.644 --> 00:48:05.488]  I think the next step is this, that the first thing the UN is going to try, at least I would if I was in its shoes, is to bring forward the next annual conference of the state parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was due to be in Mexico next December to pick up from what Copenhagen did.
[00:48:05.989 --> 00:48:16.331]  They may try to bring that forward until June, because they don't want to find, after the next midterm elections in the United States, that they can no longer get any legislation
[00:48:17.364 --> 00:48:19.826]  On their side, through either House of Congress.
[00:48:20.286 --> 00:48:22.847]  And that's what will happen, I think, after the next midterm elections.
[00:48:23.047 --> 00:48:26.109]  Because people do listen to your program, Alex.
[00:48:26.189 --> 00:48:29.190]  They listen to the other programs that I talk on quite regularly.
[00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:36.634]  And they are getting the message that they are now governed by people who really, seriously mean them harm.
[00:48:36.674 --> 00:48:41.416]  And I'm sorry to, if you like, intervene as a Brit in US politics.
[00:48:41.476 --> 00:48:43.657]  And if there are any supporters of President Obama,
[00:48:44.068 --> 00:48:50.041]  listening to this then I do apologize you for having to say this but he is now a danger
[00:48:50.498 --> 00:49:12.292]  To the United States of America, in particular to the danger to the working people of the United States of America, because those are the people, it's the people who run the aluminum melters, the people who would be digging the coal that can't now be dug, who would be running the power stations that can't be built, who would be working in those factories in Texas that you mentioned that would have been driven by the power stations that can't be built.
[00:49:12.712 --> 00:49:19.997]  These are the people, the working people, who are gradually, by a thousand here and two thousand there, losing their jobs.
[00:49:20.362 --> 00:49:28.633]  With no hope of getting their jobs back, because the industries in which they once worked, or might have worked, will never arrive again.
[00:49:28.994 --> 00:49:33.961]  Because you have an administration that is determined to shut America down.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:45.370]  Well, Lord Monckton, this is a global threat we face, and as you said, calling for a world freedom or world liberty party based in each sovereign nation, we are facing a global threat.
[00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:49.333]  It's good that I can warn people in England, you can warn people in America.
[00:49:49.533 --> 00:49:54.438]  We're facing the same threat, so we know what we're dealing with here.
[00:49:55.239 --> 00:50:01.263]  That's right, this is a global threat and you're right to remind people it's not just in the United States, it's not just Obama.
[00:50:02.024 --> 00:50:18.156]  We've got Kevin Rudd in Australia who spent, I mean after he'd heard my Minnesota speech in which I first drew attention to the world government provisions of the Covid-19 Treaty, he devoted an entire speech of three quarters of an hour to personally vilifying me.
[00:50:19.277 --> 00:50:23.479]  And he was really angry that this plot to set up a world government has been exposed.
[00:50:23.779 --> 00:50:34.463]  So he needs to be dealt with and I'm going to Australia in two weeks time to do a tour of Australia to let people hear the side of the story that the mainstream media simply won't tell them.
[00:50:34.503 --> 00:50:36.864]  And let me tell you what's happening down there in Australia at the moment.
[00:50:37.384 --> 00:50:44.507]  The government, and it was the previous administration, so again I'm not making political points here, the previous Conservative administration
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:51.465]  ...did a deal with the UN by which to comply with the Kyoto Protocol on Carbon Emissions.
[00:50:52.025 --> 00:51:04.054]  They said that if we designate the farmland of half of Australia as being a carbon sink that can't be farmed, then will that allow us to comply with our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol?
[00:51:04.234 --> 00:51:07.036]  And the UN, for some amazing reason, said yes to this.
[00:51:07.668 --> 00:51:16.430]  And it means that people who own thousands of acres of farmland are now suddenly not allowed to farm it and they've been given no compensation at all.
[00:51:16.651 --> 00:51:24.433]  So it's not only in America that terrible things are happening and people are losing their livelihood and of course the financial asset in their farmland.
[00:51:24.893 --> 00:51:27.453]  Because it's worthless now because nobody can do anything with it.
[00:51:27.473 --> 00:51:28.654]  It's got to be left fallow.
[00:51:29.194 --> 00:51:32.875]  And one poor farmer who has been heartbroken
[00:51:33.328 --> 00:51:49.054]  By this sudden, unexpected loss of his livelihood and of the capital value of his farm, without a penny in compensation from the Australian government, in the name of complying with this ludicrous Kyoto Protocol, has climbed up a television mast on his estate.
[00:51:49.094 --> 00:51:51.895]  He's living halfway up it now, with water only.
[00:51:51.935 --> 00:51:56.556]  He's been on a hunger strike now for six long weeks, 42 days.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:11.671]  And I fear he's not long for this world, but he is so angry at what has happened to him, and yet not one of the mainstream news media has even reported that this is what's being done to farmers all across Australia.
[00:52:12.032 --> 00:52:13.974]  And so you're going to break the blockade?
[00:52:14.174 --> 00:52:20.079]  The silence of the mainstream media is culpable and serious, and something is going to have to be done about it.
[00:52:20.657 --> 00:52:38.719]  Well that's obviously because they're very very scared of the truth and I have seen reports in Australian news the last two years in a positive way saying isn't it great this farmer will not be paid and no more sheep or no more corn and they just calmly announced and here in the US they're talking about
[00:52:39.259 --> 00:52:58.407]  Laying land off use and the Supreme Court rule with New London versus Kelo that they can take your property without just compensation I mean, this is the real heart of tyranny not just taking property and the power to tax the power to destroy and taxation without representation But now we'll just take your factories will give 25 billion dollars
[00:52:59.167 --> 00:53:05.971]  To the automakers as a bailout, so they can move to Russia, move to Eastern Europe, move to Brazil, move to China.
[00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:08.312]  They're paying to move jobs.
[00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:10.614]  They're paying to shut down farms and factories.
[00:53:10.894 --> 00:53:14.436]  Because once we're bankrupt, we'll be fully dependent on the globalists.
[00:53:14.456 --> 00:53:15.176]  That is their plan.
[00:53:15.196 --> 00:53:20.639]  And you know, as well as I, Lord Mocton, that the UN has stated this in their biological diversity assessments.
[00:53:20.679 --> 00:53:22.601]  Maury Strong has said this.
[00:53:23.061 --> 00:53:28.124]  This is just a group wanting to visit neo-feudalism and serfdom.
[00:53:28.764 --> 00:53:36.111]  Upon the planet so that they can play God, and it's just it's just so outrageous to witness this unfolding.
[00:53:36.732 --> 00:53:43.398]  And now, listeners, when you have heard what Alex has just said, you might have thought this is so extreme.
[00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:44.980]  It's just silly.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.503]  The trouble is that this is actually happening.
[00:53:48.543 --> 00:53:50.825]  The stories we are telling you are real.
[00:53:51.446 --> 00:53:53.027]  Factories being closed down.
[00:53:53.448 --> 00:53:53.828]  Big ones.
[00:53:54.306 --> 00:53:56.947]  In Britain, being closed down in the United States.
[00:53:57.007 --> 00:54:00.428]  Factories that would have opened, not opened.
[00:54:00.448 --> 00:54:08.031]  In Australia, farmland being taken out of use, and now by a new and pernicious extension of the doctrine of eminent domain.
[00:54:08.711 --> 00:54:17.074]  Not only can the state take away your land in the United States, it can take it away without a penny of compensation, as it's already doing in Australia.
[00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:21.855]  And all of this in the name of a problem that doesn't exist.
[00:54:22.195 --> 00:54:23.876]  There is no climate problem.
[00:54:24.659 --> 00:54:26.960]  The climate has always changed, it always will.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.480]  Humankind has a minuscule effect at the very worst.
[00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:32.941]  We are a bit part player in all this.
[00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:34.301]  There is no danger.
[00:54:34.341 --> 00:54:38.782]  We could burn as much fossil fuel as we like, create as much CO2 as we like.
[00:54:39.023 --> 00:54:41.083]  It wouldn't make any difference to the climate.
[00:54:41.643 --> 00:54:50.325]  But these people have managed by lying and lying and lying again to pretend that there is a problem where there isn't one.
[00:54:50.865 --> 00:54:53.086]  And who is going to get hurt the most?
[00:54:53.593 --> 00:54:54.694]  It's not the rich.
[00:54:55.194 --> 00:54:56.094]  It's not the big boys.
[00:54:56.754 --> 00:54:58.275]  It is the working class.
[00:54:58.335 --> 00:55:06.218]  The people who voted in their millions for President Obama, who voted in their millions for Kevin Rudd in Australia, who voted for Gordon Brown.
[00:55:06.459 --> 00:55:07.399]  It is the working people.
[00:55:07.479 --> 00:55:07.999]  And we know.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:16.783]  And we know at its heart it's all about a population control to limit our numbers, and that's why the UN says they want to shut off the food of the third world.
[00:55:17.063 --> 00:55:18.664]  You've pointed out this is a death sentence.
[00:55:19.224 --> 00:55:21.267]  To the third world, and they're able to implement that.
[00:55:21.688 --> 00:55:24.872]  And in closing, obviously it's circumstantial.
[00:55:25.072 --> 00:55:33.904]  They always use unusually hot weather, which is really normal in certain biosphere areas, as to say, oh, look, it's hot or, oh, look, there's a dust storm.
[00:55:35.299 --> 00:55:57.453]  Certainly, if they would have chosen global cooling as their fear-mongering, they would be using the news now that we see massive deaths in India from record cold, record cold in D.C., record snowfall, record cold in areas of Europe, record cold in the last hundred years around the globe, because as the satellite and ground data shows, cooling for nine years, what, leveling out in the last 14, correct?
[00:55:58.755 --> 00:55:59.515]  That's exactly right.
[00:55:59.555 --> 00:56:09.317]  The last 15 years has been no significant warming, and this winter is likely to be one of the coldest six winters of the whole of the last 100 years.
[00:56:09.377 --> 00:56:12.478]  Now, of course, one bad winter doesn't make a trend.
[00:56:12.758 --> 00:56:17.019]  But we have now had three bad winters on the trot in the Northern Hemisphere.
[00:56:17.359 --> 00:56:20.419]  We've had three bad summers on the trot, certainly in the United Kingdom.
[00:56:20.439 --> 00:56:21.820]  I don't know what it's been like in the States.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:27.721]  And so, certainly, we're not getting the pattern of relentless rapid warming.
[00:56:28.123 --> 00:56:30.965]  Which is what the models predicted.
[00:56:31.005 --> 00:56:35.668]  Now, of course, again, they will say that a short trend isn't necessarily the same thing as a long trend.
[00:56:35.688 --> 00:56:37.729]  You can get downtrends even in an uptrend.
[00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.690]  Yes, you can.
[00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:46.135]  But it's now becoming apparent that over the last 30 years, we simply haven't seen anything like the warming that the models have predicted.
[00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:49.237]  They have got it wrong, exactly as we all said they had.
[00:56:49.617 --> 00:56:50.998]  And there's now no denying it.
[00:56:51.218 --> 00:56:57.022]  And yet, they are cruelly killing off the jobs of working people throughout the Western world.
[00:56:58.704 --> 00:57:09.192]  And of course, they also sell it as if they want to help the third world with their own admissions.
[00:57:09.673 --> 00:57:14.536]  This would kill tens of millions a year who are on the verge, on the edge of starvation.
[00:57:14.576 --> 00:57:17.439]  It already is killing tens of millions.
[00:57:17.879 --> 00:57:25.625]  The awful thing is that the doubling of world food prices that was caused by the biofuel scam, taking a third of the US agricultural land out of
[00:57:26.081 --> 00:57:26.642]  I think so.
[00:57:48.095 --> 00:57:53.517]  And these profiteers are profiting out of the deaths of millions in poorer countries.
[00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:57.839]  And not a word of this is appearing in any of our mainstream news.
[00:57:58.039 --> 00:58:01.180]  Isn't that Lord Monckton genocide under the Nuremberg Code?
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.121]  Yes, I think you make a very good point there.
[00:58:04.461 --> 00:58:09.883]  And I think that if somebody were to bring Al Gore up in front of the International Criminal Court,
[00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:18.293]  Lord Monckton, let me say bye to you during the break, and also give out your website on the other side.
[00:58:18.353 --> 00:58:21.254]  Lord Christopher Monckton, our guest from the United Kingdom.
[00:58:21.274 --> 00:58:22.175]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.843 --> 00:58:43.904]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.725 --> 00:58:54.927]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.047 --> 00:58:59.428]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:59.568 --> 00:59:01.429]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:01.849 --> 00:59:03.230]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:04.510]  There is a solution.
[00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:12.754]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:59:55.328 --> 00:59:58.169]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:05.151]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:06.911]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:08.732]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.332 --> 01:00:10.152]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.912 --> 01:00:11.912]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.473 --> 01:00:16.294]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:20.715]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.062 --> 01:00:23.003]  We know the enemy.
[01:00:23.043 --> 01:00:24.004]  We know their fraud.
[01:00:24.044 --> 01:00:25.965]  We know their mass murder against humanity.
[01:00:26.165 --> 01:00:27.426]  That sounds like strong words.
[01:00:27.887 --> 01:00:29.968]  I don't have words to describe how bad this is.
[01:00:30.849 --> 01:00:33.691]  They're brainwashing the children in every public school in America.
[01:00:34.171 --> 01:00:38.094]  They have them coming home, reporting their parents, writing out eco-cop reports on them.
[01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:39.455]  It is Orwellian!
[01:00:40.467 --> 01:00:49.370]  And joining us from the land of Eric Blair, known as George Orwell, is Lord Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount of Brentley and Monckton, or Monckton and Brentley.
[01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:51.010]  We've got four minutes left, sir.
[01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:58.473]  You've got the floor as the leader in exposing these criminals and their tyranny, their genocide.
[01:00:59.273 --> 01:01:05.395]  Final statements to all the troops out there that are looking for direction in this fight against these swindlers.
[01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:17.783]  Right, the first thing is get onto the website at scienceandpublicpolicy.org and see for yourself what the science really says, how the economics really stack up, what's happening in the climate.
[01:01:17.983 --> 01:01:20.545]  You'll find that in our monthly CO2 reports, for instance.
[01:01:20.825 --> 01:01:24.388]  There's a whole segment called Monkton Papers where I've written for the layman,
[01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:34.957]  About the science of climate change, so that you can see for yourselves that when I say there isn't a problem with the climate, we're not causing global warming, you'll realise I'm not just making it up.
[01:01:35.237 --> 01:01:39.979]  There is massive evidence, overwhelming evidence now, that there is no climate problem.
[01:01:40.019 --> 01:01:40.779]  That's point one.
[01:01:41.339 --> 01:01:54.462]  Point two, you can see from the draft Copenhagen Treaty of September the 15th, which I revealed to the world on October the 14th, that they were trying to set up a world government.
[01:01:55.209 --> 01:02:00.052]  Using this climate scare as a Trojan horse to get people to submit.
[01:02:00.753 --> 01:02:02.774]  You must not submit.
[01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:09.338]  You must insist to your representative that if there is to be a world government, it must be elected.
[01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:12.240]  You are governed by an elected Congress at the moment.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:22.687]  Do not allow your president to hand your democratic rights away to a world government that has the power to order your elected Congress about.
[01:02:23.058 --> 01:02:25.780]  That's not what your constitutional founding fathers wanted.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.362]  So you must stand up for your constitution.
[01:02:29.142 --> 01:02:41.450]  The next thing you must do is rally around the working people, who are the people who are now beginning to suffer as a result of this global warming maniac scare.
[01:02:42.311 --> 01:02:45.513]  Working people who lost their jobs in that aluminum smelter.
[01:02:45.813 --> 01:02:50.616]  Working people who lost their jobs because they would have been digging coal to supply 157
[01:02:52.529 --> 01:02:55.052]  Coal-fired power stations that haven't been built.
[01:02:55.132 --> 01:02:56.894]  They would have been running those power stations.
[01:02:57.314 --> 01:03:05.623]  Those power stations in turn would have been providing the factories that would have allowed your economy in Texas and elsewhere to grow.
[01:03:06.003 --> 01:03:07.505]  All of that is being stopped.
[01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:09.960]  By the environmental Marxists.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.720]  That is what they are.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.642]  They don't care about the environment.
[01:03:12.902 --> 01:03:24.952]  If they did, they would allow power stations to be built in the United States, and not to be built in China, where the coal is burnt in a dirty way, which pollutes the atmosphere in a way that it doesn't in the United States.
[01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:29.495]  All of this has nothing whatever to do with the environment.
[01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:30.656]  You should understand that.
[01:03:31.257 --> 01:03:32.878]  Nothing whatever to do with the environment.
[01:03:33.198 --> 01:03:37.642]  It is only to do with power politics, and the aim of this power politics
[01:03:38.524 --> 01:03:46.629]  Is to dismantle the West, to dismantle the United States, to leave you and us enfeebled and incapable.
[01:03:47.189 --> 01:03:59.556]  So that a few very rich men and very rich corporations, people like Al Gore, who don't deserve to be rich, they are the people who are profiteering out of the lies that they are spreading.
[01:04:00.156 --> 01:04:05.619]  And you must help to, if you find them telling lies, complain to the police.
[01:04:05.959 --> 01:04:08.901]  The police are beginning to take an interest in this fraud now.
[01:04:09.461 --> 01:04:12.063]  Complain to the police if you think you're being lied to.
[01:04:12.423 --> 01:04:15.225]  Just go into your local police station and say, I've had enough of this.
[01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:18.707]  Look what it's costing in jobs and in money and in taxation.
[01:04:19.127 --> 01:04:21.849]  Complain to the police and make them investigate.
[01:04:21.889 --> 01:04:23.890]  They have a duty to investigate fraud.
[01:04:24.191 --> 01:04:25.872]  And a fraud is what this is.
[01:04:25.892 --> 01:04:29.154]  It's the biggest fraud that's ever been perpetrated on the world.
[01:04:29.554 --> 01:04:32.516]  And you must fight it or you will go under.
[01:04:33.806 --> 01:04:34.426]  Well said.
[01:04:34.626 --> 01:04:35.247]  Well done.
[01:04:35.427 --> 01:04:43.089]  Thank you so much, Lord Monckton, for your leadership in Copenhagen as we blew up one of their larger capital ships.
[01:04:43.169 --> 01:04:44.830]  But the fight is still on.
[01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:47.891]  But we're learning that we can't have victory because we have the truth.
[01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:51.273]  All they have is fraud, lies, corruption and genocide.
[01:04:51.853 --> 01:04:53.633]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:56.094]  We'll talk to you, sir, when you get back from Australia.
[01:04:56.454 --> 01:04:57.695]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:04:58.135 --> 01:04:59.896]  A real pleasure, and thank you, Alex.
[01:04:59.956 --> 01:05:01.478]  And, as always, God bless America.
[01:05:01.538 --> 01:05:01.918]  Thank you.
[01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:23.994]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:28.037]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.018 --> 01:05:31.380]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.163]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.243 --> 01:05:40.166]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.386 --> 01:05:45.150]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:49.477]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.483]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:06:00.148 --> 01:06:02.750]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.171 --> 01:06:08.115]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:08.495 --> 01:06:10.237]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:10.537 --> 01:06:15.361]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:15.541 --> 01:06:16.502]  How much do you want?
[01:06:16.722 --> 01:06:17.463]  When do you want it?
[01:06:17.843 --> 01:06:19.444]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:19.745 --> 01:06:20.565]  When will you need it?
[01:06:20.806 --> 01:06:22.867]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.008 --> 01:06:24.108]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:25.670]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:30.936]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.116 --> 01:06:34.340]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.224]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:38.544 --> 01:06:39.525]  How much will you need?
[01:06:39.766 --> 01:06:40.386]  We don't know.
[01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:41.588]  How much do you want?
[01:06:41.768 --> 01:06:42.509]  All you can get.
[01:06:42.709 --> 01:06:43.410]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:44.511]  We're good to go.
[01:06:59.184 --> 01:07:04.351]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:07:04.471 --> 01:07:06.414]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:07:06.554 --> 01:07:08.837]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:07:09.017 --> 01:07:10.880]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.642]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:07:12.922 --> 01:07:13.944]  There is a solution.
[01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:22.187]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:07:22.587 --> 01:07:29.670]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:35.712]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:07:36.092 --> 01:07:41.674]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:07:42.094 --> 01:07:45.935]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:07:46.235 --> 01:07:53.217]  Go to ENERFOOD.com or give them a call right now.
[01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:53.457]  866-762-9238.
[01:07:53.717 --> 01:07:58.599]  Click on their banner at InfoWars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:08:01.659 --> 01:08:07.681]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.281 --> 01:08:11.242]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.833 --> 01:08:22.243]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now 8 minutes 20 seconds into the third hour.
[01:08:22.263 --> 01:08:25.932]  We have an hour and 50 plus minutes left in worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:25.992 --> 01:08:27.776]  A ton of vital news I'm going to be going over.
[01:08:28.973 --> 01:08:30.514]  The public is being dumbed down.
[01:08:30.554 --> 01:08:32.816]  We're being chemically drugged in the food and water and air.
[01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:34.357]  That's now on record.
[01:08:34.817 --> 01:08:38.980]  The Times of London reports children reaching age three without being able to say a word.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:46.084]  Survey finds in massive numbers from television, from public school, from the preschools, from the vaccines.
[01:08:46.504 --> 01:08:51.808]  The UN is even lowering the official IQ level for average to below 100 to 95.
[01:08:54.438 --> 01:08:59.962]  Soon, in another generation or two, being able to tie your shoelaces will be a symbol of genius.
[01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:03.604]  Being able to speak will be a sign of genius.
[01:09:03.684 --> 01:09:05.626]  I'm not kidding when I say that.
[01:09:05.686 --> 01:09:08.067]  We're being turned into complete mindless animals.
[01:09:08.508 --> 01:09:17.954]  You try to talk to full-grown adults, they know nothing about the world, they can hardly speak, their vocabularies are tiny, they're little jellyfish that watch television.
[01:09:19.226 --> 01:09:24.167]  Now we still have masses of people that are awake and growing numbers of people that are hyper-awake.
[01:09:24.988 --> 01:09:36.751]  But you have a splitting of the wheat from the chaff, from the gold, from the pewter, here in this global situation we face, where either people are getting more awake or they're getting even more dumbed down.
[01:09:36.771 --> 01:09:41.193]  I'm going to get more into airport scanners going in nationwide, including Austin, Texas.
[01:09:41.233 --> 01:09:45.434]  I'm calling for a global boycott of the airlines, a strategic boycott.
[01:09:47.409 --> 01:09:52.586]  I would say in the next few days I'll announce dates and other information, but I would say coming up in about...
[01:09:53.482 --> 01:09:54.983]  Two months, so we have time to hype it.
[01:09:55.404 --> 01:09:56.765]  No one flying for a month.
[01:09:58.266 --> 01:10:02.150]  In business, talk to other businesses and say, let's do video conferencing instead.
[01:10:03.091 --> 01:10:05.433]  Let's let the airlines know we're not putting up with this.
[01:10:06.254 --> 01:10:07.395]  Let's call the Congress.
[01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:09.677]  Tell them we know this is a boondoggle and a scam.
[01:10:09.717 --> 01:10:10.397]  That's coming up.
[01:10:10.457 --> 01:10:13.220]  I've got financial news coming up as well.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.641]  The latest on the underwear bomber.
[01:10:15.342 --> 01:10:19.566]  But as promised, I want to open the phones up to first-time callers.
[01:10:20.618 --> 01:10:24.179]  I did this yesterday on the first live show of the year, the Sunday show.
[01:10:24.199 --> 01:10:25.620]  This is the first weekday show of the year.
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:30.422]  I want to do it again today about the genocide that Lord Monckton was just discussing.
[01:10:30.462 --> 01:10:31.202]  This is going on.
[01:10:31.522 --> 01:10:45.328]  Or the shutdown of our factories and our government's paying to move them to China, where they're dirty coal plants, actually increasing the devilish CO2, but actually putting out some real things like mercury and other particulates that are actually bad.
[01:10:47.386 --> 01:10:48.507]  We need to discuss this.
[01:10:48.547 --> 01:10:49.747]  We need to talk about this.
[01:10:50.307 --> 01:10:55.850]  Any issue you wish to discuss, any question, any comment you have for me, toll-free number to join us on air today, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:57.391]  1-800-259-9231 on this Monday, January 4th, 2010.
[01:10:57.491 --> 01:10:59.412]  Well, that's going to take some getting used to.
[01:10:59.432 --> 01:11:00.773]  Before we know it, it'll be 2011.
[01:11:11.758 --> 01:11:18.666]  Then 2012, nothing's going to happen in 2012 but a bunch of cults committing suicide and things I'm sure and maybe a few terror events.
[01:11:19.367 --> 01:11:20.328]  I'm going to make a film about 2012.
[01:11:20.448 --> 01:11:24.893]  I'm going to start it later this year and it will be released in the middle of 2011.
[01:11:26.795 --> 01:11:27.515]  Maybe earlier.
[01:11:27.936 --> 01:11:33.899]  I've just got so many things I've got to get going here, like daily news briefs I want to do, the television studio we're building.
[01:11:34.439 --> 01:11:40.743]  I've got so many other issues and goals I have to complete that I'm having to put films back because all of this going on and happening.
[01:11:41.123 --> 01:11:47.126]  Filmmaking is the most time-intensive thing I do next to four hours a day on the radio and several hours a day of preparation.
[01:11:48.327 --> 01:11:51.128]  But a lot going on in 2010.
[01:11:51.168 --> 01:11:53.269]  I want to hear your commitments for 2010 to fight tyranny.
[01:11:56.058 --> 01:12:01.121]  What you're committing to do in 2010, what you think the globalists are going to launch in 2010, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:12:01.341 --> 01:12:13.489]  And I've made a New Year's resolution to try to be, at least some days, a little more calm, to be more controlled and more focused, to try to cover more news and info.
[01:12:14.389 --> 01:12:16.051]  And some days it takes more calls.
[01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:22.397]  You'll still get the rants and things, but that's really a product of me being undisciplined and doing so many hours of radio.
[01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:26.602]  When I get tired and angry and just sick of all this crud, I tend to blow up.
[01:12:27.745 --> 01:12:34.668]  And that certainly is important to get angry at a core level, but then to make that constructive and put it into solutions and action, because that's what we're about here.
[01:12:34.708 --> 01:12:37.889]  Solutions and empowering the people to take action.
[01:12:37.909 --> 01:12:43.952]  That's why we're the number one target of mainstream media demonization events, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:12:45.475 --> 01:12:51.739]  And of course, COINTELPRO disinfo operatives trying to get us to all in fight instead of focusing on defeating the New World Order.
[01:12:52.319 --> 01:12:57.882]  So we're going to open the phones up right now and take calls for most of the hour.
[01:12:58.203 --> 01:13:04.887]  Then I'm going to hit a few big stories towards the end and then more calls and more news as we go into the fourth and final hour today.
[01:13:05.467 --> 01:13:10.591]  That was certainly a bone-shattering interview against the New World Order with Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:13:10.611 --> 01:13:13.293]  I believe that was the most powerful of the five interviews.
[01:13:13.313 --> 01:13:14.954]  That was the fifth interview we've done with Lord Monckton.
[01:13:15.774 --> 01:13:16.695]  Extremely powerful.
[01:13:17.395 --> 01:13:19.217]  And so you can certainly comment on that.
[01:13:19.257 --> 01:13:30.325]  I hope you take the video off PrisonPlanet.tv, burn it to DivX, and give it to everyone you know, because in that hour-long interview, probably 50 minutes of radio time, because I skipped one break and went five minutes into the third hour,
[01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:33.247]  Alex, I just want to start by saying thank you.
[01:13:33.287 --> 01:13:34.468]  You're truly my hero.
[01:13:34.888 --> 01:13:38.751]  You know, I thought I was alone in this world, seeing what was going on.
[01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:44.116]  And you show me that there's a lot of others out there fighting the fight, and I thank you for that.
[01:13:54.787 --> 01:13:57.388]  I just want to say that I think the time is now.
[01:13:57.868 --> 01:13:59.689]  I've been telling a lot of people this for a lot of years.
[01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:05.511]  For the longest time, people just looked at me with their glassed eyes, glazed over look like I'm crazy.
[01:14:06.211 --> 01:14:10.953]  But in the past few months, Alex, people are waking up faster, so fast it scares me.
[01:14:12.193 --> 01:14:12.914]  Exactly!
[01:14:12.954 --> 01:14:17.015]  And that's why I'm telling people, a lot of great people for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
[01:14:17.115 --> 01:14:20.076]  In fact, I want to get Red Beckman back on the show.
[01:14:20.336 --> 01:14:21.037]  He's been fighting him for 50.
[01:14:22.062 --> 01:14:24.603]  You know, it was so hard 10 years ago, 20 years ago.
[01:14:24.623 --> 01:14:27.244]  Now, world government's out in the open.
[01:14:27.304 --> 01:14:29.185]  Now is the time to expose these people.
[01:14:30.106 --> 01:14:37.569]  Well, I just want to say that one of the things that I did that I would like to encourage other people to do is to maintain contact with your local police.
[01:14:37.989 --> 01:14:44.592]  You know, I live in a small town and you think that these guys don't know, but a lot of them do and some of them don't.
[01:14:45.172 --> 01:14:45.993]  And they need to know.
[01:14:46.113 --> 01:14:47.813]  I think they need to know who we are, where we are.
[01:14:47.853 --> 01:14:49.014]  You know why they're waking up?
[01:14:49.474 --> 01:15:12.813]  Because for 50 years, and a lot of them of course are out of the force, 30-40 years, but in the last few decades especially, they get these monthly secret reports demonizing, these crazy people say there's going to be a carbon tax, these crazy people say there's a world government, these crazy people say the banks are going to bankrupt us by design and want to shut down our industry, and that's what the hell they read, and the cops go, but that's what's happening!
[01:15:13.473 --> 01:15:26.766]  See, the globalist-owned propaganda is blowing up in their face because they wanted to psychologically imprint people to where, when world government finally got set up, no one would resist it because they've been told it wasn't kosher to talk about.
[01:15:27.086 --> 01:15:31.630]  But now, it's okay to talk about it because it's out in the open.
[01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:35.193]  Sir, when I tell people we're having victories, folks, we are.
[01:15:35.553 --> 01:15:42.377]  But at the same time, the New World Order is in control of the government, so they're just expanding their operation because they have nothing to lose.
[01:15:42.637 --> 01:15:45.919]  They've committed so many crimes that they can't turn back now.
[01:15:45.999 --> 01:15:51.343]  We're on a collision course, and it's important for police and military to understand we're not your enemy.
[01:15:51.383 --> 01:15:52.464]  We're the American people.
[01:15:52.764 --> 01:16:00.248]  But you work for the New World Order, and you need to become aware of that and realize and start saying no to this together, and we can save America.
[01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:00.649]  Go ahead.
[01:16:01.502 --> 01:16:04.104]  Yeah, no, you're right on Alex, as always.
[01:16:04.124 --> 01:16:08.428]  And, you know, like I say... So you're talking to the local cops and they're awake.
[01:16:08.468 --> 01:16:09.428]  What do they say?
[01:16:09.508 --> 01:16:11.270]  Make sure everybody in your town knows.
[01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:13.412]  I've talked to my town officials, my selectmen.
[01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:14.272]  They all know.
[01:16:14.633 --> 01:16:17.215]  So that way, I mean... Well, I mean, stop, stop, stop, Aaron.
[01:16:17.255 --> 01:16:18.716]  Tell me what they say when you talk to them.
[01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:29.205]  Uh, well, you know, a lot of them, they say, you know, geez, we know, you know, I know that the world's going, you know, going to hell in a handbasket and all that, and, you know, and, and, and, but, but they're starting to see it.
[01:16:29.365 --> 01:16:32.306]  I've got, you know, like I said, there's a couple of them, I talked to the local detective.
[01:16:32.626 --> 01:16:36.308]  They're the good, good, good people to talk to, the detectives, because they've got the mind for that.
[01:16:36.328 --> 01:16:39.469]  They're already, you know, their, their, their minds... I agree, they're not stupid.
[01:16:39.769 --> 01:16:41.750]  I've talked to a bunch of LAPD detectives.
[01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:44.771]  Different events and things I've been at with Hollywood people.
[01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:51.013]  It's always retired detectives or part-time detectives that are guarding them, and they say they're all awake, and this was years ago.
[01:16:51.953 --> 01:16:54.874]  For the first time, Alex, I really see hope.
[01:16:55.335 --> 01:16:57.435]  And for a long time, like I said, I've seen this since I was a kid.
[01:16:57.475 --> 01:16:59.336]  I've been trying to warn people since I was a kid I've seen it.
[01:16:59.356 --> 01:17:00.356]  It was just clear as day to me.
[01:17:00.376 --> 01:17:02.157]  I don't even understand how other people can't.
[01:17:02.537 --> 01:17:05.138]  It boggles my mind how people can't see what's happening to them.
[01:17:05.258 --> 01:17:07.079]  Let me tell you why, Aaron, and I appreciate your call.
[01:17:07.139 --> 01:17:07.839]  They're cowards.
[01:17:08.639 --> 01:17:16.003]  And even if it's admitted on television that world government's here, they don't want to resist it or speak out against it because they don't respect themselves.
[01:17:16.683 --> 01:17:17.784]  And that's what's sad about it.
[01:17:18.404 --> 01:17:19.205]  They have no idea.
[01:17:19.245 --> 01:17:20.245]  You're alive once.
[01:17:20.345 --> 01:17:21.246]  We're being tested.
[01:17:21.546 --> 01:17:22.846]  It's time to make the choice.
[01:17:23.307 --> 01:17:24.887]  Jeff in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:17:25.788 --> 01:17:27.189]  Thanks, Alex, for taking my call.
[01:17:27.569 --> 01:17:29.710]  Just to give you a little bit of hindsight, man.
[01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:36.493]  Nine months ago, I was a Donald Republican, and then I was on the radio dial one day, and I turned to you.
[01:17:38.365 --> 01:17:47.767]  I found a voice that was similar to what I was thinking, man, and I just want to let you know that ever since I've been woke up, I've hit the ground running to try to spread the information.
[01:17:49.448 --> 01:17:58.870]  Former law enforcement, I've contacted a ton of my old friends that are, you know, SWAT team guys, detectives, everything, you know, and I try to tell them what's going on.
[01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:07.732]  And, you know, it's a little bit of a joke between me and them is that, you know, I love you, man, and I want you to wake up because I'd hate to have to fight you one day.
[01:18:08.744 --> 01:18:29.726]  And I just want you to know that I'm out here and in Memphis area and I'm trying to wake up as many people as I can and you really don't know where your reward is until you see the people start waking up and I woke up you know 20-30 people ever since you know I started listening to you and I knew that what I was thinking inside that
[01:18:30.399 --> 01:18:31.259]  I wasn't crazy.
[01:18:31.579 --> 01:18:34.301]  And the secret is, Jeff, I didn't wake you up.
[01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:35.281]  You were already awake.
[01:18:35.601 --> 01:18:38.722]  And those 30 people you've woken up, you didn't wake them up.
[01:18:38.782 --> 01:18:41.863]  You simply pointed out what they already knew subconsciously.
[01:18:43.224 --> 01:18:43.864]  Absolutely.
[01:18:44.064 --> 01:18:53.708]  And just to take it one step further, I'm in a suburb of the Memphis area and I'm actually going to run for city council in our suburb.
[01:18:54.475 --> 01:18:55.256]  Absolutely, man.
[01:18:55.296 --> 01:18:57.279]  And I just want you to say to keep up the good work, man.
[01:18:57.439 --> 01:18:59.101]  And for soldiers like me, we're out here.
[01:18:59.121 --> 01:19:02.025]  We're getting the information out for you, man.
[01:19:10.438 --> 01:19:11.319]  Well, God bless you, Jeff.
[01:19:11.359 --> 01:19:12.419]  I'm a foot soldier, too.
[01:19:12.439 --> 01:19:14.080]  I mean, we're all in this together.
[01:19:14.621 --> 01:19:24.887]  And that's what's so frustrating about seeing people in government and corporations and just the general public saying, oh, it's not my job, or I'm glad you're out there, Alex.
[01:19:25.368 --> 01:19:27.049]  I'm just a regular guy like you, Jeff.
[01:19:28.137 --> 01:19:35.039]  I mean, I was in college and they were teaching me world government was good, and my founding fathers were bad, and that the Second Amendment was bad.
[01:19:35.059 --> 01:19:37.740]  And I said, this is a bunch of sedition.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:38.900]  Who are these people?
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.641]  And I went and found out the whole story.
[01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:44.182]  And that was 18, 19, 20 years ago.
[01:19:44.922 --> 01:19:46.542]  And I got on air 14 years ago.
[01:19:46.562 --> 01:19:47.883]  14 plus now.
[01:19:47.903 --> 01:19:49.563]  A little bit over 14 years.
[01:19:49.763 --> 01:19:51.604]  And the lesson I learned
[01:19:52.558 --> 01:19:57.570]  Is that if you just stand up on your feet and fight back, you will start winning.
[01:19:57.690 --> 01:19:58.632]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:02.541]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:20:02.661 --> 01:20:04.402]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:20:04.563 --> 01:20:06.344]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[01:20:06.424 --> 01:20:07.745]  We paid off all of our bills.
[01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:10.607]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[01:20:10.627 --> 01:20:16.212]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[01:20:16.292 --> 01:20:17.873]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:20:17.973 --> 01:20:20.535]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:20:20.575 --> 01:20:21.036]  No More Mortgage.
[01:20:23.057 --> 01:20:24.278]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:20:24.338 --> 01:20:26.778]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:20:26.838 --> 01:20:30.480]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.841]  I'm Larry Ruff, President of No More Mortgage.

[01:21:33.008 --> 01:21:34.809]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:21:35.089 --> 01:21:36.490]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:39.092]  The economy is bad, but it's probably gonna get worse.
[01:21:39.372 --> 01:21:43.735]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:21:44.095 --> 01:21:47.477]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.

[01:24:08.959 --> 01:24:12.742]  Let's try to get three calls in in this short five-minute segment.
[01:24:13.162 --> 01:24:14.843]  Tony in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:24:16.665 --> 01:24:17.846]  Hey, buddy.
[01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:20.368]  One second, Tony.
[01:24:20.508 --> 01:24:20.748]  Okay.
[01:24:20.768 --> 01:24:23.410]  Hey, I'm sorry about that.
[01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.790]  Go ahead.
[01:24:24.391 --> 01:24:24.591]  Yes.
[01:24:24.611 --> 01:24:36.620]  I'm sorry, but I found it kind of interesting when you were talking about how the globalists and how they pretty much try to desensitize us and dumb us down.
[01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:40.357]  Maybe not quickly, but, you know, incrementally.
[01:24:40.978 --> 01:24:41.198]  Yes.
[01:24:41.779 --> 01:24:44.041]  Okay, well, I got a perfect example.
[01:24:44.722 --> 01:24:46.504]  I saw a movie a few months back.
[01:24:46.884 --> 01:24:47.285]  It's called
[01:24:48.268 --> 01:24:48.708]  Idiocracy.
[01:24:48.768 --> 01:24:50.390]  I don't know if you've ever heard about it.
[01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:51.290]  Yeah, Mike Judge.
[01:24:51.330 --> 01:24:52.011]  He's a great guy.
[01:24:52.051 --> 01:24:52.852]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:53.012 --> 01:24:57.135]  I found it really hilarious, you know, when I first... But that's actually how it's going to be.
[01:24:57.195 --> 01:24:59.497]  That's the globalist plan.
[01:24:59.517 --> 01:25:01.738]  Except they won't keep a bunch of morons around.
[01:25:01.758 --> 01:25:05.361]  After everybody's dumbed down, they're going to accelerate their soft kill operation.
[01:25:05.381 --> 01:25:08.904]  But everybody's so poisoned and so dumbed down, they can't even tell what's happening to them.
[01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:15.369]  Yeah, I found it pretty hilarious when I was watching it and I just started thinking about everything, you know.
[01:25:15.731 --> 01:25:17.032]  Yeah, Mike Judge is a fan of this show.
[01:25:17.553 --> 01:25:18.954]  Yeah, Mike Judge is a good guy.
[01:25:18.974 --> 01:25:20.936]  It's a new movie.
[01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:36.516]  Extract, I think, is one of his best.
[01:25:36.957 --> 01:25:39.479]  I just watched that on the treadmill last week, jogging.
[01:25:40.259 --> 01:25:42.000]  And, uh, yeah, idiocracy.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.361]  That's exactly what we're talking about.
[01:25:43.401 --> 01:25:44.382]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:44.702 --> 01:25:45.543]  Good to hear from you, Tony.
[01:25:45.583 --> 01:25:46.023]  Good point.
[01:25:46.364 --> 01:25:47.565]  Marlon in Texas.
[01:25:47.945 --> 01:25:48.886]  Marlon, you're on the air.
[01:25:48.926 --> 01:25:49.346]  Go ahead.
[01:25:50.126 --> 01:25:50.347]  Yeah.
[01:25:50.387 --> 01:25:50.967]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:51.047 --> 01:25:52.588]  I listen to your show all the time.
[01:25:52.608 --> 01:25:54.229]  I encourage people to listen to it.
[01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:59.513]  If nothing, if for nothing else for entertainment, I really appreciate your perspectives.
[01:26:00.274 --> 01:26:04.177]  My question is about one of your major points is usually
[01:26:04.764 --> 01:26:07.185]  The false left-right paradigm.
[01:26:08.466 --> 01:26:21.131]  And I have a lot of trouble because having come from a Southern Baptist background in the service, I'm really clear who the right wing is and I'm very aware of their intolerance
[01:26:22.054 --> 01:26:22.515]  I don't
[01:26:40.814 --> 01:26:51.022]  And you notice government gets bigger, we lose more freedoms no matter who is in, and you get 75, 80, 90% of the people against open borders, 99% against the banker bailout.
[01:26:51.302 --> 01:26:52.063]  That was in Gallup.
[01:26:52.423 --> 01:26:53.384]  It still happens.
[01:26:54.205 --> 01:26:57.607]  Okay, so my point is, is that's all window dressing.
[01:26:57.968 --> 01:27:04.112]  We need to start debating the shadow government, the private banks that have illegitimately bought off both parties.
[01:27:04.913 --> 01:27:14.339]  Okay, and they dangle intolerance issues out there to get people on the left to vote for big government as if somebody's suppressing them.
[01:27:14.699 --> 01:27:16.740]  So what if somebody doesn't like your lifestyle?
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.201]  There's freedom in this country.
[01:27:18.561 --> 01:27:22.364]  It's a political football to be tossed back and forth all day.
[01:27:23.044 --> 01:27:29.406]  And then the left comes in and wants to indoctrinate people's kids when that's up to the parents to decide how their kids are raised.
[01:27:29.746 --> 01:27:36.827]  So the right wing legitimately tells the left, don't teach my six-year-old how to fist or other things like that.
[01:27:37.148 --> 01:27:38.508]  And they go, oh, you're intolerant.
[01:27:38.688 --> 01:27:40.768]  Do you know what they teach kids in public school?
[01:27:42.829 --> 01:27:44.689]  I understand your perspective on that.
[01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:50.331]  Well, look, I mean, what is it you don't... I mean, you say for entertainment purposes.
[01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:50.891]  I had a guy...
[01:27:53.362 --> 01:27:58.006]  The day before Christmas Eve at a gas station come up and say, do you really believe all the stuff you say?
[01:27:58.827 --> 01:28:03.370]  And I said, sir, almost everything I talk about you can document.
[01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.852]  I believe everything I'm saying.
[01:28:05.172 --> 01:28:10.677]  Sometimes I have a guest on, sometimes we cover things that I don't believe in on the air to have a debate about it.
[01:28:11.637 --> 01:28:15.681]  And it's good to get outside the box and just have a debate, but everything I talk about
[01:28:16.161 --> 01:28:18.723]  Everything I discuss, I believe.
[01:28:19.144 --> 01:28:20.665]  Because I have the evidence, sir.
[01:28:21.165 --> 01:28:23.467]  Look at everything I talk about ends up unfolding.
[01:28:23.748 --> 01:28:26.910]  I told you they were going to put body scanners in all airports six years ago.
[01:28:27.371 --> 01:28:29.993]  Seven years ago, as I saw Governor Ridge say they were going to do it.
[01:28:30.253 --> 01:28:32.415]  I mean, what is entertaining about this?
[01:28:32.435 --> 01:28:34.236]  Because let me tell you, this isn't entertaining for me.
[01:28:34.657 --> 01:28:37.899]  I wake up almost every night freaked out about what's going on.
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.441]  I know how real this is.
[01:28:39.701 --> 01:28:43.104]  I'm freaked out about having to say no to the body scanners now when I fly.
[01:28:43.144 --> 01:28:43.985]  They're going in everywhere.
[01:28:44.525 --> 01:28:46.365]  But I'm gutting up and getting ready to do that.
[01:28:46.986 --> 01:28:48.406]  And things are getting more serious.
[01:28:48.506 --> 01:28:49.866]  I mean, what is it?
[01:28:50.026 --> 01:28:51.227]  This is not entertaining, sir.
[01:28:51.947 --> 01:28:53.367]  I mean, this is funny to you?
[01:28:53.387 --> 01:28:58.548]  I'm not suggesting that it's funny for a moment.
[01:28:58.588 --> 01:29:04.530]  I know that you're very, very serious, and I appreciate all the documentation that you do get to.
[01:29:05.150 --> 01:29:10.531]  For people that don't understand, I mean, all you have to do is mention some small thing about
[01:29:11.095 --> 01:29:15.477]  The things that you believe and their eyes glaze over and they stop listening.
[01:29:15.697 --> 01:29:16.478]  That's right, Marlon.
[01:29:16.498 --> 01:29:21.520]  They've been preconditioned that when they hear world government, they start laughing.
[01:29:22.403 --> 01:29:31.907]  I mean, I was on the radio this morning locally on a talk station talking about the body scanners and how they record it and how they keep your kid's blood at birth and they played Crazy Train in the background.
[01:29:32.528 --> 01:29:35.509]  They take your kid's blood at birth illegally for a UN database.
[01:29:35.769 --> 01:29:36.309]  It's admitted.
[01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:39.030]  They're putting in body scanners that record your naked body.
[01:29:39.311 --> 01:29:43.032]  It isn't funny, but people are subconsciously afraid of my information.
[01:29:43.312 --> 01:29:48.915]  Instead of standing up and saying no to it, it's easier to play Crazy Train or helicopter noises in the background.
[01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:53.312]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.233 --> 01:29:57.035]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.098 --> 01:30:01.078]  What's your home worth?
[01:30:01.258 --> 01:30:03.200]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:06.102]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[01:31:59.332 --> 01:32:03.574]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:03.874 --> 01:32:07.955]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.216 --> 01:32:13.638]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:13.958 --> 01:32:14.438]  It's true.
[01:32:14.698 --> 01:32:19.260]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:20.120]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:23.681]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:27.682]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:27.902 --> 01:32:28.442]  Number 4.
[01:32:28.682 --> 01:32:31.063]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.443 --> 01:32:34.844]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.124 --> 01:32:35.344]  Number 5.
[01:32:35.924 --> 01:32:39.845]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.065 --> 01:32:44.826]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:49.148]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.288 --> 01:32:50.869]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.069 --> 01:32:53.170]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:55.331]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:55.411 --> 01:32:55.891]  All aboard!
[01:33:10.365 --> 01:33:13.507]  The states are all in the process of going bankrupt.
[01:33:13.987 --> 01:33:17.089]  Foreign banks have stolen over $28 trillion.
[01:33:17.129 --> 01:33:18.690]  We now got the numbers from last year.
[01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:21.451]  And won't say where the money went.
[01:33:22.171 --> 01:33:27.054]  The government's paying to have factories shut down and coal plants and won't let new ones be built.
[01:33:27.915 --> 01:33:30.496]  But China can put up dirty ones that our government pays for.
[01:33:30.536 --> 01:33:37.340]  They're putting in body scanners where you put your hands up in an act of submission and they scan you.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.321]  Everyone's being trained to be slaves.
[01:33:42.694 --> 01:33:46.937]  But you're crazy if you are against it.
[01:33:49.239 --> 01:33:50.340]  It's all peer pressure.
[01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:55.404]  They get everybody addicted to Madison Avenue and to buying into whatever the mainstream media says.
[01:33:56.185 --> 01:34:08.034]  And if the mainstream media says line your kids up and give them deadly inoculations that the drug zone insert admits can brain damage them, give them Guillain-Barré syndrome, sterilize them, reduce fertility, give them cancer, kill them.
[01:34:09.996 --> 01:34:10.657]  It's no big deal.
[01:34:10.677 --> 01:34:12.078]  You're supposed to just go along with that.
[01:34:12.878 --> 01:34:19.168]  But the good news is this big flu hype didn't go over well, and there's record numbers of people not taking it.
[01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:27.561]  The good news is the Copenhagen Treaty that the UN announced was world government blew up in their face, all their fraud and corruption's coming out.
[01:34:28.789 --> 01:34:35.897]  The good news is, 30 plus states are moving or have already declared 10th Amendment sovereignty to the federal government.
[01:34:36.538 --> 01:34:44.287]  The states and the Congress are telling Obama lawsuits are going to get filed by the states against his government takeover of healthcare, even if he can ram it through.
[01:34:46.738 --> 01:34:49.719]  The good news is the people are starting to figure out how the world really works.
[01:34:49.759 --> 01:34:51.419]  And Marlon, I wasn't trying to be mean to you.
[01:34:51.739 --> 01:34:59.441]  It's just when somebody says to me, oh, your show is entertaining, because I get emails like that and people on the street go, I don't agree with a lot of what you say, but your show is sure entertaining.
[01:35:02.082 --> 01:35:06.242]  That's like saying watching a car wreck and somebody flopping around with their arm chopped off is entertaining.
[01:35:06.603 --> 01:35:08.163]  This is not entertaining, sir.
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:13.703]  It's not entertaining having the mainstream media demonize me and having people death-threaten me.
[01:35:14.023 --> 01:35:19.627]  It's not entertaining to know what we're up against and to force myself to stand up and go up against it.
[01:35:21.008 --> 01:35:25.331]  If you had any idea just how serious this was, you wouldn't even have that in your repertoire.
[01:35:29.854 --> 01:35:30.414]  And you know what?
[01:35:30.474 --> 01:35:36.619]  It's not my fault and it's not your fault, Marlon, if you try to wake up people and they laugh at you.
[01:35:37.179 --> 01:35:38.000]  That's their problem.
[01:35:38.911 --> 01:35:40.651]  That's why their standard of living is dropping.
[01:35:41.091 --> 01:35:59.055]  You know, I saw this weekend IMF statistics about how this country was, what was it, 34% of global gross domestic product, and is now 22% of global domestic product, global GDP, or global domestic product.
[01:36:00.436 --> 01:36:02.316]  The calculation of the U.S.
[01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:02.716]  was 34, 35, now it's 22, 23.
[01:36:02.856 --> 01:36:03.056]  In fact,
[01:36:07.126 --> 01:36:08.467]  I printed that article at home.
[01:36:08.487 --> 01:36:12.408]  I want to say it was Wall Street Journal this weekend and I don't have it in front of me.
[01:36:13.048 --> 01:36:15.149]  Guys, Google IMF says U.S.
[01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:16.529]  gross domestic product drops.
[01:36:17.069 --> 01:36:17.770]  That should bring it up.
[01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:21.031]  I believe from memory it's 22 percent from 34 or 35.
[01:36:21.791 --> 01:36:23.452]  But let's get the actual numbers.
[01:36:23.672 --> 01:36:24.492]  You think that's funny?
[01:36:26.638 --> 01:36:31.760]  I know you don't think it's funny, Marlon, but when people laugh at us, that's because they're intimidated.
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:32.400]  They're scared.
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:34.041]  Deep down, they know something's wrong.
[01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:35.821]  And they want to feel elitist.
[01:36:35.861 --> 01:36:37.322]  They want to feel like they're establishment.
[01:36:37.582 --> 01:36:42.664]  And so TV and the culture has told them, laugh at somebody who talks about global government.
[01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:45.285]  Laugh at somebody that talks about global corruption.
[01:36:45.625 --> 01:36:47.086]  You don't have a responsibility.
[01:36:47.126 --> 01:36:47.926]  Just laugh at it.
[01:36:49.106 --> 01:36:51.107]  That's the doctrine of slaves.
[01:36:51.507 --> 01:36:53.548]  That's the modus operandi of slaves.
[01:36:57.386 --> 01:36:58.287]  Now, here's the deal.
[01:37:04.272 --> 01:37:05.573]  I took two calls in that segment.
[01:37:05.693 --> 01:37:08.375]  I want to take ten calls before this hour ends.
[01:37:09.896 --> 01:37:11.317]  That gives each caller about a minute and a half.
[01:37:13.339 --> 01:37:16.662]  Joe, Jack, Matthew, Steve, Nick and others, toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:37:16.722 --> 01:37:24.028]  I do have a bunch of news I haven't even gotten to yet coming up in the next hour and a host of issues.
[01:37:25.054 --> 01:37:26.295]  On how children in the U.S.
[01:37:26.315 --> 01:37:27.737]  and England can't even talk now.
[01:37:27.757 --> 01:37:29.919]  I mean, our society's falling apart.
[01:37:29.959 --> 01:37:34.363]  Before I go any further, I want to thank some of the sponsors today that have made this radio broadcast possible.
[01:37:35.404 --> 01:37:36.706]  The news website's possible.
[01:37:37.426 --> 01:37:38.628]  My filmmaking possible.
[01:37:38.708 --> 01:37:43.633]  It is the advertising that funds the Lock, Stock and Barrel, along with PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[01:37:43.673 --> 01:37:45.835]  And I want to thank all of you for supporting our sponsors.
[01:37:47.188 --> 01:37:49.789]  One of the sponsors I want to thank is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:37:49.829 --> 01:37:51.951]  That's the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[01:37:52.411 --> 01:37:53.531]  Incredible new website.
[01:37:53.551 --> 01:37:54.352]  It was great before.
[01:37:54.712 --> 01:38:00.915]  All these videos, non-GMO, non-hybrid, organic food lines, pre-made food lines.
[01:38:00.955 --> 01:38:03.297]  Incredibly tasty, like potatoes gratin.
[01:38:04.352 --> 01:38:04.812]  You name it.
[01:38:05.453 --> 01:38:07.655]  It's all there at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:38:07.895 --> 01:38:09.897]  You'll never stand in the bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:38:10.177 --> 01:38:11.758]  The globalists want you dependent on them.
[01:38:11.778 --> 01:38:12.719]  They want you bankrupt.
[01:38:12.759 --> 01:38:14.000]  They want you under their control.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:15.441]  I have storable food.
[01:38:15.461 --> 01:38:16.622]  Does that mean I'll end up using it?
[01:38:17.163 --> 01:38:18.183]  I can eat it if I don't.
[01:38:18.584 --> 01:38:21.026]  It lasts more than 10 years.
[01:38:21.066 --> 01:38:22.707]  A lot more than 10 if it's in climate control.
[01:38:22.727 --> 01:38:23.908]  My stuff's in the garage and attic.
[01:38:25.069 --> 01:38:25.830]  I got firearms.
[01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:27.071]  Does that mean I may have to use them?
[01:38:27.111 --> 01:38:28.192]  Hopefully not, but I got them.
[01:38:28.612 --> 01:38:29.493]  And I know how to use them.
[01:38:29.773 --> 01:38:31.975]  They're in well-oiled working condition.
[01:38:34.778 --> 01:38:38.121]  The point is, you need to go to eFoodsDirect.com and get high-quality, storable foods today.
[01:38:38.141 --> 01:38:38.181]  800-409-5633.

[01:38:38.721 --> 01:38:46.607]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is AcolaBlue.com.
[01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:50.150]  They've got their new Acola Blue 30 out, discounted out of the gates.
[01:38:50.590 --> 01:38:52.112]  They have the classic Acola Blue 28.
[01:38:52.372 --> 01:38:57.156]  Grabs upwards of 7.5 gallons out of the air a day.
[01:38:57.216 --> 01:38:58.437]  Puts it through 7 filters.
[01:38:59.177 --> 01:39:00.458]  The Acola Blue 30 even more.
[01:39:01.519 --> 01:39:03.380]  Reverse osmosis, carbon, UV.
[01:39:05.043 --> 01:39:06.443]  Stores it in stainless steel tanks.
[01:39:07.464 --> 01:39:09.804]  Looks like a water cooler without the water cooler top on it.

[01:39:11.725 --> 01:39:14.385]  That's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.

[01:39:23.548 --> 01:39:28.349]  Ladies and gentlemen, great folks, great sponsors, great product that I was using.
[01:39:28.369 --> 01:39:29.389]  That's why I reached out to them.
[01:39:29.889 --> 01:39:30.869]  Turned out they were fans.
[01:39:31.049 --> 01:39:32.390]  It was a match made in heaven.
[01:39:32.410 --> 01:39:33.150]  acolablue.com.
[01:39:34.409 --> 01:39:36.551]  Okay, back to your calls.
[01:39:36.651 --> 01:39:38.032]  Joe in California, go ahead.
[01:39:38.932 --> 01:39:39.553]  Hi Alex.
[01:39:40.033 --> 01:39:41.674]  Hey buddy.
[01:39:41.854 --> 01:39:45.657]  First and foremost, I want to thank you for your efforts and your courage.
[01:39:45.757 --> 01:39:48.179]  There's a couple of things I'd like to touch on quickly.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:53.863]  One of them, Vietnam Cambodia grant 6970.
[01:39:54.464 --> 01:39:58.046]  Anyway, I feel so grateful to hear you.
[01:39:58.126 --> 01:40:00.188]  I stumbled serendipitously upon
[01:40:01.144 --> 01:40:06.327]  The bar shallot died, leather rises, the police state, that's how I found you, thank the Lord I found you.
[01:40:06.347 --> 01:40:17.872]  And anyway, it's also, I feel gratified that what I knew back then, that things weren't right behind the scenes, and you're exposing it, it's so great.
[01:40:18.432 --> 01:40:30.298]  The other thing, the last thing I would like to touch on, I've heard all my life about carbon monoxide, CO, being poison, but now CO2 is poison, which we exhale, the plants inhale,
[01:40:30.871 --> 01:40:37.973]  Well, how come nobody's ever talked about, well, we should quit making carbonated beverages because that's CO2, and I don't know if that makes sense.
[01:40:37.993 --> 01:40:41.955]  Well, actually, governments are moving to tax it because of that.
[01:40:42.895 --> 01:40:45.676]  Almost everything puts off CO2, that's why they chose it.
[01:40:46.296 --> 01:40:51.318]  They don't want to deal with real toxic waste or genetic engineering or things that can and are causing problems.
[01:40:51.778 --> 01:40:55.519]  They want something that allows them to selectively control industry.
[01:40:55.559 --> 01:40:57.699]  They're monopoly capitalists.
[01:40:57.719 --> 01:40:58.899]  They're not free market.
[01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:01.760]  They use government to shut down their competition.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:02.660]  Joe?
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:03.880]  Okay.
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:06.761]  Well, it's been nice chatting with you live.
[01:41:06.841 --> 01:41:15.822]  I've listened to you ever since, I don't know, two or three years ago and I really do appreciate and enjoy your program and it's very enlightening.
[01:41:15.862 --> 01:41:19.183]  It's so hard to get people to get their heads out of the sand because
[01:41:19.761 --> 01:41:20.641]  They're scared, I guess.
[01:41:20.721 --> 01:41:23.182]  I'm afraid they're a greeter to the biggest human minorities.
[01:41:23.202 --> 01:41:27.983]  They've been raised to be lazy and to not think of themselves as leaders.
[01:41:28.444 --> 01:41:33.145]  They've been raised to just go through life, and I mean intellectually lazy.
[01:41:33.205 --> 01:41:34.465]  You know, a lot of them are hard working.
[01:41:34.686 --> 01:41:36.846]  They have to understand that freedom isn't free.
[01:41:37.146 --> 01:41:38.167]  People better do the research.
[01:41:38.187 --> 01:41:38.967]  They better get involved.
[01:41:38.987 --> 01:41:39.787]  Joe, good to hear from you.
[01:41:40.187 --> 01:41:41.247]  Jack in California.
[01:41:41.267 --> 01:41:42.168]  You're on the air, Jack.
[01:41:44.048 --> 01:41:44.669]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:45.129]  How's it going?
[01:41:45.509 --> 01:41:45.869]  Good, sir.
[01:41:47.569 --> 01:41:49.130]  I wanted to talk to you.
[01:41:50.243 --> 01:41:51.844]  About a few things.
[01:41:51.884 --> 01:41:55.545]  First off, huge fans.
[01:41:56.145 --> 01:42:02.648]  And like everyone else, I've been noticing more and more and more and more people waking up all the time and it's great to see.
[01:42:04.269 --> 01:42:09.871]  And especially in the San Francisco area, around where I live, you see billboards everywhere.
[01:42:10.984 --> 01:42:12.245]  You know, go get vaccinated.
[01:42:12.305 --> 01:42:16.428]  Only you can prevent H1N1, you know, and I'll talk to you about it.
[01:42:28.457 --> 01:42:30.659]  Yeah, I agree with you on that one.
[01:42:30.719 --> 01:42:31.940]  And then the Christmas Day bombing.
[01:42:56.089 --> 01:43:07.691]  I saw that on television briefly and I was flipping through the channels for about two hours and it was just all conflicting reports and all of them saying full body scan.
[01:43:07.731 --> 01:43:09.772]  We need more security at the airport.
[01:43:09.972 --> 01:43:14.812]  Within minutes the scanners are the answer and this happens right as the scanners are going in.
[01:43:15.073 --> 01:43:17.133]  They're saying, oh we're putting these in because of this now.
[01:43:17.353 --> 01:43:18.593]  They were ordered a year ago.
[01:43:18.793 --> 01:43:20.373]  They were going in the last three months.
[01:43:20.434 --> 01:43:22.934]  Now they're all going in right on time with this.
[01:43:23.214 --> 01:43:23.614]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:43:47.185 --> 01:43:57.116]  I haven't had a whole lot of time in the last week or two to really catch up, but can you explain just more the benefit of us going to Yemen?
[01:43:57.156 --> 01:43:59.719]  Is that supposed to put more pressure on Saudi?
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:01.721]  Well, no, I appreciate your call.
[01:44:01.761 --> 01:44:02.321]  No, no, no.
[01:44:02.341 --> 01:44:04.023]  That's to aid Saudi Arabia.
[01:44:05.014 --> 01:44:07.055]  Who's in a civil war right now with Yemen.
[01:44:07.215 --> 01:44:09.777]  Our troops are already there in the last three or four months, 2,000 of them.
[01:44:10.117 --> 01:44:12.198]  The bombing raids, the CIA are already there.
[01:44:12.518 --> 01:44:14.039]  They want to go into North Africa as well.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.180]  Into Somalia and Sudan.
[01:44:16.921 --> 01:44:17.881]  They're on the East Coast.
[01:44:20.043 --> 01:44:22.804]  This is all part of the new agenda, the new rollout of tyranny.
[01:44:23.545 --> 01:44:24.365]  Clearly staged.
[01:44:24.986 --> 01:44:28.628]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Matthew in New Hampshire.
[01:44:28.968 --> 01:44:30.028]  The Live Free or Die State.
[01:44:30.048 --> 01:44:30.669]  Go ahead, Matthew.
[01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:32.750]  Hey, yeah, Alex.
[01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:33.731]  Great to talk to you.
[01:44:34.741 --> 01:44:35.621]  You're a huge fan.
[01:44:35.682 --> 01:44:37.422]  I mean, I'm a huge fan of yours.
[01:44:37.462 --> 01:44:40.024]  You and Ron Paul are, like, two of my greatest role models.
[01:44:40.084 --> 01:44:43.706]  Well, I'm a huge fan of you Liberty Lovers, so that's mutual.
[01:44:43.746 --> 01:44:44.206]  Exactly.
[01:44:44.286 --> 01:44:54.131]  I'm a member of the Free State Project here in New Hampshire, and, you know, we try to fight, you know, the globalism through local legislation and trying to get proper people elected, and that's what we need to do.
[01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:55.712]  You're fighting well, too.
[01:44:56.724 --> 01:44:59.886]  Yeah, I got my car spray-painted with Infowars.
[01:44:59.946 --> 01:45:02.907]  It's on the hood and down each side and you should see it.
[01:45:03.087 --> 01:45:07.350]  It's so great because I drive down the street and people are hanging out their cars, yelling and screaming.
[01:45:08.290 --> 01:45:11.152]  A lot of people listen to you and you do an amazing job.
[01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:13.833]  Well, let me just say this, Matthew, and then here's your final point.
[01:45:15.254 --> 01:45:24.739]  When I get up here and I tell people that I get off a plane in Central America or in Canada or in England now, or anywhere, we run into listeners.
[01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:31.312]  You know, four or five years ago I'd be in England, and you know, I might run into ten people when I'm on the street the whole time I'm there.
[01:45:31.332 --> 01:45:36.595]  Now, everywhere I go, I mean, cars are stopping, people are stopping.
[01:45:36.856 --> 01:45:41.078]  You wear an Infowars.com t-shirt out in public, you're going to meet like-minded people.
[01:45:41.098 --> 01:45:45.581]  All these patriots send me letters saying, start a dating service, I want to meet like-minded patriots.
[01:45:45.961 --> 01:45:48.823]  Folks, you wear an Infowars.com shirt to parties, events.
[01:45:49.403 --> 01:45:54.148]  You're going to find like-minded women and men, depending if you're a man or a woman.
[01:45:54.409 --> 01:46:00.476]  That doesn't mean that they're going to want to date you, but if you're talkative and charming, that may happen.
[01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:04.460]  That's why COINTELPRO is attacking us.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.062]  That's why they're hitting us from all sides.
[01:46:06.382 --> 01:46:09.926]  Because they know we have really had a big effect.
[01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:12.690]  And it actually creeps me out.
[01:46:12.951 --> 01:46:14.552]  I never intended to be in this position.
[01:46:14.992 --> 01:46:24.438]  I never intended for this to happen, but you say you drive around with InfoWars.com spray-painted on your car, and how, I mean, does it happen every time you go out?
[01:46:24.538 --> 01:46:27.600]  How much is this happening where people respond to you?
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:30.762]  Again, that's a sonar ping of how many people are awake.
[01:46:31.923 --> 01:46:32.803]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:32.883 --> 01:46:33.384]  It's weird.
[01:46:33.444 --> 01:46:36.145]  It's because at first I expected to get in fights over it, maybe.
[01:46:36.206 --> 01:46:37.847]  You know, maybe people would be against the whole 9-11 thing.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:44.042]  But it's almost every other day, and I'm not exaggerating, and they don't just honk.
[01:46:44.102 --> 01:46:47.503]  I mean, people are leaning out their windows, waving, shaking their fists.
[01:46:48.023 --> 01:46:49.123]  It's pretty impressive.
[01:46:49.223 --> 01:46:50.624]  I mean, you've got to see it.
[01:46:51.504 --> 01:46:55.265]  And it is, and it's about that, you know, fighting through local government.
[01:46:55.305 --> 01:46:59.727]  And I would imagine one-one-hundredth of people that see it and like it are the ones that are waving at you.
[01:47:00.647 --> 01:47:01.067]  Exactly.
[01:47:01.107 --> 01:47:05.569]  You know, so many people, because I have a pretty cool, loud sports car that I whip around,
[01:47:06.499 --> 01:47:10.521]  You know, people are always kind of gawking at it, so that's why I decided to put InfoWars on it.
[01:47:11.981 --> 01:47:13.942]  Has it been helpful with the ladies?
[01:47:15.343 --> 01:47:16.303]  Well, I have a girlfriend.
[01:47:16.343 --> 01:47:17.424]  I've been with her for eight years.
[01:47:17.524 --> 01:47:21.645]  We were both, you know, in the InfoWars together, so she's amazingly beautiful.
[01:47:22.106 --> 01:47:23.886]  So, you know, we're both in school to be educated.
[01:47:23.906 --> 01:47:24.967]  Nothing like a patriot.
[01:47:25.027 --> 01:47:26.307]  Nothing like a patriot woman.
[01:47:27.188 --> 01:47:27.828]  Exactly.
[01:47:27.908 --> 01:47:28.488]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:47:28.528 --> 01:47:34.391]  I had to find a girlfriend who could understand these issues, because otherwise she'd get sick of me fighting for these issues, you know?
[01:47:35.054 --> 01:47:38.416]  So I'm in school to be an educator so I can inform, you know, students.
[01:47:38.436 --> 01:47:39.777]  I want to be a high school science teacher.
[01:47:40.297 --> 01:47:46.861]  And you've kind of, you know, after thinking about what I want to do with my life, I realized that's one of the best ways to inform.
[01:47:46.881 --> 01:47:50.944]  And you will influence thousands of people with the truth instead of the brainwashing.
[01:47:50.984 --> 01:47:52.285]  Matthew, send us a photo.
[01:47:52.325 --> 01:47:56.047]  Send it to ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com, your car, and we'll try to post it.
[01:47:56.067 --> 01:47:57.408]  All right, you got it.
[01:47:57.768 --> 01:47:58.729]  Good to hear from you, Matthew.
[01:47:58.749 --> 01:47:59.249]  You're awesome.
[01:47:59.930 --> 01:48:00.710]  Very exciting.
[01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:02.331]  Steve in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:02.351 --> 01:48:02.911]  You're on the air.
[01:48:02.952 --> 01:48:03.332]  Go ahead.
[01:48:03.982 --> 01:48:05.183]  Hi Alex, it's good to hear your voice.
[01:48:05.783 --> 01:48:06.163]  Hey buddy.
[01:48:06.583 --> 01:48:11.685]  Hi, I was calling to get in on that conversation about the awakening and the dual nature of man.
[01:48:11.745 --> 01:48:14.907]  I wanted to share a couple of my beliefs and thoughts and get your feedback on it.
[01:48:15.047 --> 01:48:15.287]  Sure.
[01:48:15.747 --> 01:48:24.791]  That man's basically a spiritual being that's tied to a physical existence and that at the same time we're individuals and we are one being.
[01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:29.353]  We're like drops in an ocean or leaves on a tree or... Well we're definitely tied into other people.
[01:48:30.049 --> 01:48:34.939]  Yeah, like brains in a brain cell, and we're at a stage now that we have enough people.
[01:48:34.979 --> 01:48:35.981]  We're at a critical mass.
[01:48:36.522 --> 01:48:39.689]  We're kind of like that space baby in 2001 Space Odyssey.
[01:48:40.837 --> 01:48:48.900]  And that a depopulation scheme would serve to, like, jack a needle into the back of our head, suck our brains out, and try to abort us before we actually get to wake up.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.661]  No, that's exactly the New World Order wants to abort us.
[01:48:51.741 --> 01:48:53.461]  They've made the calculations.
[01:48:54.222 --> 01:48:56.262]  All they can do is set a grid up and kill us.
[01:48:56.302 --> 01:48:57.603]  They know we're going to resist.
[01:48:58.063 --> 01:49:02.044]  They know we're going to win, and so they're setting up the police state grid to kill people.
[01:49:02.945 --> 01:49:06.706]  Yeah, so what I'd like to suggest is that we have a coordinated
[01:49:07.569 --> 01:49:08.390]  We're good to go.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:38.961]  It's that simple.
[01:49:39.542 --> 01:49:51.778]  And even if you don't believe in God, if you every day sit down for five minutes and meditate, and by meditate I don't mean like a yogi, I mean think about the world, think about what's really important, slow down a little bit, get in that quiet place.
[01:49:53.148 --> 01:49:57.710]  Because anytime I get death threats or get persecuted or get lied about, sometimes I get bummed out a little.
[01:49:58.170 --> 01:50:03.293]  And I always just sit down and think about it and say, God, and God says, look, think about all these innocents you're saving.
[01:50:03.333 --> 01:50:04.233]  Think about humanity.
[01:50:04.253 --> 01:50:08.875]  Think about all the courage it took before you to bring all of us to this point.
[01:50:09.416 --> 01:50:10.896]  This is part of your mission.
[01:50:11.277 --> 01:50:13.037]  And then I'm not worried about whatever happens to me.
[01:50:13.378 --> 01:50:18.000]  Whatever happens, no matter how horrible it is or how much they demonize me or what they make up about me,
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:19.981]  I know in the end I'm good.
[01:50:20.001 --> 01:50:21.323]  I know in the end I tried.
[01:50:21.343 --> 01:50:23.205]  I know in the end I did the best job I could.
[01:50:23.485 --> 01:50:30.792]  It was rags before God, but it was that my heart was right and that I repented and I wanted to be a good person.
[01:50:31.273 --> 01:50:33.395]  And I wanted to have courage and stand up.
[01:50:33.875 --> 01:50:37.499]  And then you get to the point almost where I have really no fear.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.621]  And I almost wish I had the fear.
[01:50:40.442 --> 01:50:42.923]  Because then it made me a little more frosty and concerned.
[01:50:42.943 --> 01:50:47.023]  I've kind of just gotten where the explosions are going off around me, and I'm not even paying attention to them.
[01:50:47.544 --> 01:50:55.705]  But I still have the fear for innocence, and I have the anger that innocents are being abused, and so that's the real fuel that drives my reactor.
[01:50:56.085 --> 01:51:00.006]  We're gonna come back, take a bunch more calls, on the other side of this quick break.
[01:51:06.688 --> 01:51:07.468]  Aerial spray.
[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:11.102]  Chemtrails, the modified atmosphere.
[01:51:11.642 --> 01:51:17.725]  Heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[01:51:18.426 --> 01:51:20.967]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[01:51:21.527 --> 01:51:28.531]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:51:28.731 --> 01:51:35.335]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[01:51:35.919 --> 01:51:39.140]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:43.162]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[01:51:43.702 --> 01:51:48.343]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[01:51:48.864 --> 01:51:52.025]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.045]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:05.426 --> 01:52:08.410]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:08.651 --> 01:52:10.073]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:13.458]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:13.478 --> 01:52:19.700]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:24.862]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:24.882 --> 01:52:35.026]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world governments.
[01:52:35.126 --> 01:52:37.247]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:37.487 --> 01:52:38.807]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:39.067 --> 01:52:41.348]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:41.528 --> 01:52:43.368]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:43.388 --> 01:52:48.469]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:48.789 --> 01:52:57.912]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:00.089 --> 01:53:03.110]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:53:03.450 --> 01:53:07.071]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[01:53:07.351 --> 01:53:10.812]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:53:11.093 --> 01:53:18.575]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[01:53:18.575 --> 01:53:18.815]  Yes, it is.

[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:47.324]  I was trying to have the guys find me that article from the Wall Street Journal about the U.S.
[01:54:47.664 --> 01:54:48.685]  being 34-35% of GDP 10 years ago, global GDP.
[01:54:54.346 --> 01:54:57.809]  Global Gross Product, I guess, would be the term.
[01:54:58.570 --> 01:55:00.051]  And how it's now down to 22.
[01:55:00.232 --> 01:55:00.992]  They didn't find that.
[01:55:01.012 --> 01:55:02.153]  They found another one from December 22, 2009.
[01:55:03.114 --> 01:55:05.316]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:55:05.416 --> 01:55:06.357]  Economists react.
[01:55:06.417 --> 01:55:08.539]  GDP revision surprisingly large.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:11.402]  And it just shows the big drop in 2008, 2009.
[01:55:11.462 --> 01:55:12.803]  But I'm looking for the global gross product.
[01:55:22.861 --> 01:55:24.022]  But we'll see if we can find that.
[01:55:24.322 --> 01:55:26.323]  This is the search.
[01:55:26.363 --> 01:55:26.823]  Try this.
[01:55:28.204 --> 01:55:28.524]  U.S.
[01:55:28.584 --> 01:55:33.386]  share of global domestic product or U.S.
[01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:39.690]  share of gross product drops to 22%.
[01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:41.351]  I think that was the headline.
[01:55:42.211 --> 01:55:43.492]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:55:43.612 --> 01:55:46.233]  Bunch of news coming up at the 8 after in the next hour.
[01:55:46.253 --> 01:55:48.354]  Continuing with calls after that.
[01:55:48.694 --> 01:55:50.595]  But right now, let's go to Nick in Illinois.
[01:55:50.655 --> 01:55:51.476]  Nick, you're on the air.
[01:55:51.536 --> 01:55:51.856]  Welcome.
[01:55:55.486 --> 01:55:57.007]  Go ahead, Nick, you're on the air.
[01:55:57.027 --> 01:55:58.888]  Okay, let Nick go.
[01:55:58.928 --> 01:56:00.169]  Let's go to James in Canada.
[01:56:00.529 --> 01:56:01.350]  James, you're on the air.
[01:56:01.410 --> 01:56:01.730]  Welcome.
[01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:03.071]  Alex.
[01:56:03.531 --> 01:56:03.831]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:04.832 --> 01:56:04.952]  Hi.
[01:56:05.372 --> 01:56:06.973]  It's a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:56:07.033 --> 01:56:09.875]  I'm calling you from Vancouver, Canada.
[01:56:11.175 --> 01:56:11.716]  How's it going?
[01:56:12.096 --> 01:56:12.336]  Good.
[01:56:13.477 --> 01:56:14.597]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment.
[01:56:14.638 --> 01:56:18.640]  I don't know if you can keep track of all the radio stations, but we recently had a
[01:56:19.489 --> 01:56:21.191]  Long time station.
[01:56:21.231 --> 01:56:23.653]  I know you're aware of it.
[01:56:23.673 --> 01:56:24.053]  1410 AM.
[01:56:24.153 --> 01:56:25.174]  It was airing Coast.
[01:56:28.957 --> 01:56:30.218]  We didn't hang up on that caller.
[01:56:31.259 --> 01:56:32.520]  Strange sounding caller.
[01:56:34.221 --> 01:56:35.222]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[01:56:35.242 --> 01:56:36.663]  You can call back when you get in, James.
[01:56:37.404 --> 01:56:38.805]  Because I want to hear what you had to say.
[01:56:38.905 --> 01:56:40.326]  Greg in New York, you're on the air.
[01:56:40.366 --> 01:56:40.727]  Go ahead.
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.980]  Hi Alex, how are you today, my friend?
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:43.540]  Good!
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.341]  I've got a quick question for you, sir.
[01:56:45.361 --> 01:57:05.185]  I know you don't watch a lot of TV, and neither do I, because it's obviously propaganda, but my wife and I was watching Fox News late last night, and they were breaking in about Obama's vacation in Hawaii, and Alex, I swear that probably within that three-minute little episode of Obama, they stated his birthplace in Hawaii probably 15 to 20 times,
[01:57:06.795 --> 01:57:09.897]  Kept repeating it over and over and over in his day.
[01:57:09.917 --> 01:57:11.038]  Yeah, that's pure propaganda.
[01:57:11.158 --> 01:57:12.419]  I see that everywhere as well.
[01:57:12.439 --> 01:57:14.480]  Because I watch boil down clips on the web.
[01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:22.085]  And it was like his whole trip to Hawaii, before he went, during it, now coming back, was about at his birthplace, at his birthplace, at his birthplace.
[01:57:22.386 --> 01:57:23.867]  That was definitely a talking point.
[01:57:24.727 --> 01:57:25.227]  Unbelievable.
[01:57:25.287 --> 01:57:29.550]  And people, I can't believe that they literally eat that stuff up with a spoon.
[01:57:29.771 --> 01:57:30.671]  Alex is kind of sick.
[01:57:30.691 --> 01:57:33.293]  And up here in upstate New York, it's getting very
[01:57:33.826 --> 01:57:35.267]  Very repressive.
[01:57:35.387 --> 01:57:36.847]  Prices are going through the roof.
[01:57:36.928 --> 01:57:38.188]  Unemployment is just unbelievable.
[01:57:38.208 --> 01:57:39.289]  Well, it's connectivity.
[01:57:39.329 --> 01:57:41.730]  They've announced they want quote, martial law and U.S.
[01:57:41.850 --> 01:57:42.670]  Army on the streets.
[01:57:43.151 --> 01:57:48.693]  Areas of Oklahoma, but mainly into Arkansas.
[01:57:49.073 --> 01:57:51.374]  They're talking about daytime curfews for adults.
[01:57:51.455 --> 01:57:52.155]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:57:53.015 --> 01:58:04.743]  I'm up by, unfortunately, Fort Drum, uh, Syracuse area, Watertown, and I cannot tell you how many border patrols that we see going up and down the thruway, um, military, military equipment.
[01:58:04.803 --> 01:58:16.111]  I myself was the next medic in the service, and some of this equipment I see going up and down the thruway is just mind-blowing, and when we tell people to get ready for martial law, Alex, we're not kidding, get ready for martial law.
[01:58:16.571 --> 01:58:19.293]  Excuse me, hold on, hold on, where was this set?
[01:58:20.765 --> 01:58:24.308]  This was up and down the thruway, going up towards Fort Drum.
[01:58:25.289 --> 01:58:29.032]  And you're saying those big, flashing Homeland Security billboards they put in were saying this?
[01:58:29.712 --> 01:58:30.493]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:58:30.573 --> 01:58:35.036]  Just the equipment from the trucks, from the military, going up and down the thruway.
[01:58:35.257 --> 01:58:36.398]  Okay, I misunderstood you.
[01:58:36.438 --> 01:58:38.679]  You're saying, get ready for Marshall Long.
[01:58:42.282 --> 01:58:43.843]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:14.898 --> 02:00:16.279]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[02:00:24.292 --> 02:00:27.455]  We're getting into some financial news as well.
[02:00:28.295 --> 02:00:30.797]  And continue taking your phone calls.
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:42.687]  Also, I got a lot of emails last week and this weekend asking me if this story that was out was true.
[02:00:42.727 --> 02:00:45.549]  The UN is issuing their own gold currency.
[02:00:46.210 --> 02:00:49.833]  Paul Watson did some research at PrisonPlanet.com and found that it's a hoax.
[02:00:51.022 --> 02:00:54.884]  UN Gold Hoax Muddies the Waters of Real Move Towards Global Currency.
[02:00:55.285 --> 02:00:57.786]  That is coming up first after the break.
[02:00:58.607 --> 02:01:00.648]  Right now, Diane in Michigan.
[02:01:00.668 --> 02:01:01.248]  You're on the air.
[02:01:01.268 --> 02:01:01.949]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:01.969 --> 02:01:03.489]  Yes.
[02:01:03.690 --> 02:01:04.590]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:05.451 --> 02:01:09.753]  Alex, I am a person who is more knowledgeable than average people.
[02:01:09.813 --> 02:01:16.877]  Not only the American Free Press I subscribe to, but the Contact Paper out of Las Vegas.
[02:01:17.538 --> 02:01:18.939]  I want to tell you on page 8,
[02:01:20.206 --> 02:01:24.310]  of the last contact, which was December 2nd, 2009.
[02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:31.557]  The Knights Carbonic article by George Monbiot, B-I-O-T.
[02:01:31.597 --> 02:01:35.420]  Monbiot, yeah, he's a socialist London Guardian writer.
[02:01:36.221 --> 02:01:45.707]  Okay, well, you said, in this it says, published in The Guardian, 23rd November 2009, a conspiracy which proves that man-made global warming is a scam.
[02:01:46.187 --> 02:01:49.148]  It's no use pretending that this isn't a major blow.
[02:01:49.469 --> 02:01:56.853]  The emails extracted by a hacker from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging.
[02:01:57.313 --> 02:02:03.315]  I am now convinced that they are genuine, and I'm dismayed and deeply shaken by them.
[02:02:03.355 --> 02:02:03.835]  Hold on, ma'am.
[02:02:03.855 --> 02:02:04.736]  We covered that at the time.
[02:02:04.796 --> 02:02:13.339]  He admitted, and they now admit those emails are real, but he still says Global Warming's man-made, just that this fraud really hurts them.
[02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:15.039]  So what's your point about Mombiot?
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:16.640]  You!
[02:02:16.700 --> 02:02:23.282]  This here goes into an email sent, the Knights Carbonics, on October 29th, 2009.
[02:02:25.518 --> 02:02:33.966]  Through the Professor Ernst Wiesel, University of Redcar, 21st Grand Warden of the Temple of Knights Carbonic.
[02:02:34.691 --> 02:02:46.113]  In the bottom of the article, after he talks about the three ways that they have masterplanned this, in the very beginning, for the cap and trade to happen and the one world government to happen.
[02:02:46.173 --> 02:02:46.953]  Yes, they've announced that.
[02:02:46.973 --> 02:02:52.294]  It says here, I'm going to read to you, our co-option of the physical world has been just as successful.
[02:02:52.734 --> 02:02:55.975]  The thinning of the Arctic ice cap was a masterstroke.
[02:02:56.395 --> 02:03:00.536]  The ring of secret nuclear power stations around the Arctic Circle.
[02:03:01.917 --> 02:03:16.985]  Well, ma'am, I appreciate your call, but again, I've seen nothing like that, and mixing in Monbiot in The Guardian talking about something, and with that, send me some information, okay?
[02:03:17.025 --> 02:03:19.327]  Showtips at Infowars.com.
[02:03:20.067 --> 02:03:21.048]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:22.028 --> 02:03:25.010]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:03:26.331 --> 02:03:29.052]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Texas.
[02:03:29.072 --> 02:03:29.893]  George, you're on the air.
[02:03:31.544 --> 02:03:32.944]  Hello, is this Alex?
[02:03:33.144 --> 02:03:34.065]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:03:34.665 --> 02:03:39.786]  Yes, Alex, I just wanted to get your comment.
[02:03:40.046 --> 02:03:54.589]  I've got some information on where I live, and it's regarding our Second Amendment, and I wanted to ask you, as far as what you know of the law, does not state law overrule district law?
[02:03:56.405 --> 02:04:10.807]  Yes, but a lot of county, if you mean that by district, and city laws against the Second Amendment in different states, particularly Texas and a few others, do get overturned, but a lot of them don't get challenged.
[02:04:11.927 --> 02:04:24.117]  Uh, and so there are a lot of cities and counties that have set up anti-Second Amendment laws against gun shows or gun shops or other things that are a violation of state law because the state hasn't said they could do that.
[02:04:24.738 --> 02:04:27.880]  The people's representatives, the legislature, haven't authorized it.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:32.184]  Uh, but just because something's unconstitutional doesn't mean they won't throw you in prison for it.
[02:04:32.965 --> 02:04:33.885]  Uh, why?
[02:04:33.925 --> 02:04:34.526]  What's going on?
[02:04:35.347 --> 02:04:36.267]  Uh, yes, Alex.
[02:04:36.728 --> 02:04:40.431]  I live, I live on a subdivision with, uh, I guess about, I'm
[02:04:41.343 --> 02:04:45.145]  I want to say, sir, about 37 miles from the closest town.
[02:04:45.805 --> 02:04:52.688]  I'm back in the hill country, and there was a problem we had with poaching out here, and there's houses... Stay there!
[02:04:52.708 --> 02:04:53.589]  I want to hear about it!
[02:04:55.049 --> 02:04:56.730]  Do you have that MJTF Group 13?
[02:04:56.770 --> 02:04:57.911]  They're really bad.
[02:05:01.047 --> 02:05:04.711]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:04.731 --> 02:05:08.074]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:08.294 --> 02:05:13.099]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:05:13.119 --> 02:05:19.365]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:19.505 --> 02:05:21.748]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.849]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:05:23.889 --> 02:05:25.030]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:27.272]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:41.161 --> 02:05:43.003]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:05:43.023 --> 02:05:48.130]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:48.450 --> 02:05:57.562]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:00.287 --> 02:06:02.888]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:03.288 --> 02:06:08.251]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:08.611 --> 02:06:10.352]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:10.672 --> 02:06:15.474]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:15.674 --> 02:06:16.635]  How much do you want?
[02:06:16.855 --> 02:06:17.595]  When do you want it?
[02:06:17.975 --> 02:06:19.576]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:19.856 --> 02:06:20.677]  When will you need it?
[02:06:20.937 --> 02:06:22.998]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:23.138 --> 02:06:24.238]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:24.478 --> 02:06:25.779]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:25.999 --> 02:06:31.066]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:31.246 --> 02:06:34.471]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:34.851 --> 02:06:38.356]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:38.676 --> 02:06:39.657]  How much will you need?
[02:06:39.898 --> 02:06:40.519]  We don't know.
[02:06:40.799 --> 02:06:41.720]  How much do you want?
[02:06:41.901 --> 02:06:42.641]  All you can get.
[02:06:42.842 --> 02:06:43.643]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:43.923 --> 02:06:46.686]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:46.966 --> 02:06:49.168]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.208 --> 02:06:50.169]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:59.625 --> 02:07:00.606]  What's your home worth?
[02:07:00.766 --> 02:07:02.709]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:07:02.889 --> 02:07:05.633]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:07:05.933 --> 02:07:13.462]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[02:08:00.638 --> 02:08:02.840]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:06.282]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.408 --> 02:08:19.012]  Okay, going back to George in Texas, then I'm gonna hit a bunch of news and go back to your calls.
[02:08:20.543 --> 02:08:21.543]  George, slowly.
[02:08:21.944 --> 02:08:25.045]  You're saying you live in a rural subdivision, the Texas Hill Country.
[02:08:25.065 --> 02:08:26.986]  I guess that means Central Texas.
[02:08:27.006 --> 02:08:28.187]  There's only one hill country here.
[02:08:28.207 --> 02:08:30.868]  That's where I live, here in Central Texas.
[02:08:31.908 --> 02:08:34.290]  And you said that there was a problem with poaching.
[02:08:34.610 --> 02:08:37.791]  There's always a problem while they've got to take your rights away.
[02:08:37.811 --> 02:08:39.212]  What are they doing to your Second Amendment?
[02:08:40.132 --> 02:08:43.454]  Well, what it is, Alex, it's one family.
[02:08:43.694 --> 02:08:45.795]  And I have no problem that people are hungry.
[02:08:46.235 --> 02:08:49.757]  But I went to this subdivision committee
[02:08:50.345 --> 02:08:58.752]  Went to the county courthouse, took the person to court, and they put a lawsuit on him.
[02:09:01.254 --> 02:09:12.283]  What the district judge said, it's in Rialto County in Texas, the district judge said, I'm going to make it global, no discharging of firearms.
[02:09:12.996 --> 02:09:20.502]  And the game warden was present in the courtroom and he said, I asked him, I said, well, what do I do if there's a rattlesnake outside or a rabbit animal?
[02:09:20.522 --> 02:09:21.763]  Well, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[02:09:21.783 --> 02:09:22.984]  We've got lots of judges.
[02:09:23.545 --> 02:09:35.054]  There was one a couple years ago in Tennessee, somebody outside, it was a city judge, outside of his jurisdiction put up a sign saying our courts are a joke because of a divorce proceeding he'd had.
[02:09:35.414 --> 02:09:38.076]  Didn't even say the judge's name, but if he would have, it would have been okay.
[02:09:38.457 --> 02:09:39.377]  They had him arrested.
[02:09:39.418 --> 02:09:41.960]  Now, the judge got in trouble later, but it shows they're delusional.
[02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:52.563]  You're telling me, because a family was reportedly poaching, that the judge said in the neighborhood, in the town, in the county, where, he said a global.
[02:09:52.583 --> 02:09:54.784]  When they say global, that means everywhere in his jurisdiction.
[02:09:55.124 --> 02:09:57.165]  When a judge says global, that means their jurisdiction.
[02:09:57.625 --> 02:10:02.726]  You're telling me that he said no firearms discharged where?
[02:10:04.447 --> 02:10:07.888]  Within this subdivision that I live at, and it was a female judge.
[02:10:08.757 --> 02:10:10.318]  But hold on, you're in the, but hold on.
[02:10:10.859 --> 02:10:16.743]  Is there a county law, are you in the county, and is there a county law against discharging firearms?
[02:10:17.403 --> 02:10:17.724]  No, sir.
[02:10:19.425 --> 02:10:22.207]  Well that's, sir, you should, you should contact the newspapers.
[02:10:22.267 --> 02:10:25.669]  That is, uh, so, so, so let me get this straight.
[02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:30.653]  Somebody said a family was hunting deer for food, or, I mean, you should, tell me the whole story.
[02:10:31.333 --> 02:10:31.754]  Uh, yes, sir.
[02:10:31.794 --> 02:10:36.017]  What they did, uh, they found some deer, uh, they had found, uh, one deer,
[02:10:36.696 --> 02:10:37.136]  I think so.
[02:10:55.928 --> 02:11:01.211]  Uh, and because a white tail was shot, what does that have to do with any of you?
[02:11:01.231 --> 02:11:02.552]  I mean, again, that's what they do now.
[02:11:03.012 --> 02:11:05.173]  Oh, a guy tried to blow up a plane with underwear.
[02:11:05.373 --> 02:11:08.014]  We're going to record all your naked bodies with body scanners now.
[02:11:08.615 --> 02:11:09.235]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:09.255 --> 02:11:13.237]  I mean, again, so, so, so some deer guts.
[02:11:14.278 --> 02:11:20.801]  I just, Alex, I told, uh, the members on this board, uh, where I live, I said, well, doesn't state law, castle law.
[02:11:21.431 --> 02:11:24.434]  Overruled district law as far as discharging a firearm.
[02:11:24.834 --> 02:11:29.858]  If there's a rabid animal or a snake, I have a right to shoot it if my wife is going out to hang clothes.
[02:11:30.639 --> 02:11:33.721]  And they said, well, yeah, yeah, that's, that's, that's true.
[02:11:33.781 --> 02:11:37.044]  But, uh, you know, and I said, but no, that's state law.
[02:11:37.144 --> 02:11:40.887]  Castle law says I have a right to protect my property and or my person.
[02:11:41.508 --> 02:11:46.652]  And then they wanted to argue it and they, but the judge in the county said that it was global.
[02:11:47.185 --> 02:11:53.089]  That no discharging of firearms is now implemented by the board out here and by the district judge.
[02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:55.992]  And the game warden said, I said, well, what am I supposed to do?
[02:11:56.012 --> 02:11:59.915]  And he goes, well, the game warden answered and replied, well, you're in a catch 22.
[02:12:00.675 --> 02:12:05.719]  So I got to call a game warden that covers two counties here in Texas to come kill a rattlesnake.
[02:12:06.099 --> 02:12:07.720]  No, let me stop you.
[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:09.462]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:12:09.502 --> 02:12:12.944]  You've got a big problem and you should write it up, post on the web somewhere.
[02:12:13.585 --> 02:12:13.785]  Look,
[02:12:15.851 --> 02:12:23.538]  Take Freestone County, where my dad's got some family property going back to Mexican Land Grants.
[02:12:24.759 --> 02:12:30.684]  It's one thing to say you can't shoot a little rack, or you can't shoot a big giant rack.
[02:12:31.545 --> 02:12:35.028]  They will arrest you, take your car, take your rifles in Freestone County.
[02:12:35.048 --> 02:12:36.649]  They're doing this in many other counties.
[02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:37.570]  There's plenty of deer.
[02:12:37.610 --> 02:12:38.311]  The deer are everywhere.
[02:12:38.771 --> 02:12:41.554]  Giant deer, little deer, you know, everything.
[02:12:42.659 --> 02:12:47.041]  They've got what they call, I guess, the abnormal ones that have the giant racks.
[02:12:48.908 --> 02:12:58.874]  And they're saying you can't shoot something if it doesn't have a certain spread, which nobody can measure, or if it's a four-point, you can't shoot it, but if it's a three-point, you can.
[02:12:59.875 --> 02:13:02.776]  And there's just no way for people to know.
[02:13:03.517 --> 02:13:06.138]  Most of that deer hunting out there is done in brush.
[02:13:06.178 --> 02:13:08.320]  That's where the good deer are.
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:11.361]  They're smart and don't come out during deer season, except at night.
[02:13:11.782 --> 02:13:16.985]  So you've got to hunt in brush, and a lot of times you can see some big antlers and take your shot.
[02:13:17.685 --> 02:13:24.211]  And then they're not even, you know, they're trying to restrict DOE permits for people to, you see, the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:13:24.231 --> 02:13:28.435]  A permit is an authorization to do something that's illegal.
[02:13:29.136 --> 02:13:30.417]  So they turn your right into a privilege.
[02:13:30.457 --> 02:13:40.426]  It's like 60-something years ago, I forget the exact date, it was in the 40s, New York City said, you still got your Second Amendment, you gotta pay this, what was it, $5 licensing fee.
[02:13:40.666 --> 02:13:41.367]  It's a formality.
[02:13:42.469 --> 02:13:43.450]  People accepted that.
[02:13:44.211 --> 02:13:49.195]  A decade later or so, they said, okay, now you gotta pay a big fee.
[02:13:49.515 --> 02:13:49.955]  It's bigger.
[02:13:50.216 --> 02:13:51.597]  And we're gonna restrict who gets it.
[02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:58.743]  Until now, only a few hundred people have got firearms permits and they're basically all mafia or corrupt Goldman Sachs employees.
[02:13:58.783 --> 02:14:03.007]  That was even in the Bloomberg a few weeks ago.
[02:14:03.087 --> 02:14:04.208]  They're all getting gun permits.
[02:14:05.269 --> 02:14:07.931]  So, that's how they turn a right into a privilege.
[02:14:07.971 --> 02:14:09.753]  That's why I'm against concealed carry permits.
[02:14:10.615 --> 02:14:16.300]  You have a gun permit in Texas and Nevada and Arizona and Vermont under the Second Amendment.
[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:18.141]  The state hasn't abridged it.
[02:14:19.122 --> 02:14:23.045]  But because under common law, concealed weapons are illegal.
[02:14:23.966 --> 02:14:24.887]  It's bearing arms.
[02:14:24.947 --> 02:14:26.508]  Keep and bear arms.
[02:14:26.788 --> 02:14:27.969]  Good guys have them out in the open.
[02:14:29.471 --> 02:14:33.214]  So they're creating the custom and the general idea that you gotta have a permit to own a gun.
[02:14:33.534 --> 02:14:38.158]  And all these Hollywood shows and cop shows based in New York and other places always show them
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:44.445]  Busting people in fiction and non-fiction shows in New York or Chicago.
[02:14:44.926 --> 02:14:50.011]  And so you get a repair person at your house, they see a gun case, they go out and call the cops.
[02:14:50.752 --> 02:14:54.856]  Because they move here from New York or wherever, they think your guns are illegal.
[02:14:54.956 --> 02:14:56.338]  I've had this happen to me.
[02:14:57.822 --> 02:14:58.222]  Okay?
[02:14:58.983 --> 02:15:01.163]  Because people are so dumbed down.
[02:15:02.304 --> 02:15:05.885]  So the perception that guns are illegal is now out there.
[02:15:06.546 --> 02:15:08.486]  How many billboards have you seen in the last decade?
[02:15:08.806 --> 02:15:09.527]  More than a decade.
[02:15:09.927 --> 02:15:16.550]  I've seen the same variant, federally funded, the ad council with your tax money, billboards all over the country.
[02:15:16.630 --> 02:15:18.170]  I've been in Galveston, Texas.
[02:15:18.590 --> 02:15:19.831]  I've been in Dallas, Texas.
[02:15:19.911 --> 02:15:21.632]  I've been in Los Angeles, California.
[02:15:22.702 --> 02:15:29.870]  I've been in Chicago, I've been in Florida, I have been all over the country, not even looking for these, and I see them.
[02:15:31.371 --> 02:15:36.176]  And it shows a billboard, and it says, Report Illegal Guns.
[02:15:37.818 --> 02:15:42.283]  And it's a picture, or a graphic, of a handgun pointed at you aggressively.
[02:15:43.888 --> 02:15:48.271]  It'll have the front cylinder with the bullets in it and the barrel aimed at you threateningly.
[02:15:48.311 --> 02:15:49.312]  It's all psychological.
[02:15:50.053 --> 02:15:53.355]  Or it'll have the gun turned sideways with a guy with a mask on.
[02:15:53.395 --> 02:15:54.857]  The image is criminals have guns.
[02:15:55.117 --> 02:15:56.258]  I've seen several different variants.
[02:15:56.278 --> 02:15:57.038]  You've seen them on the web.
[02:15:57.539 --> 02:16:00.141]  I've posted photos I took myself in Galveston.
[02:16:01.282 --> 02:16:02.703]  And in tiny, fine print.
[02:16:02.743 --> 02:16:04.184]  You gotta get right up onto the billboard.
[02:16:04.584 --> 02:16:05.585]  I got 20-20 vision.
[02:16:05.605 --> 02:16:06.886]  You gotta squint to read it.
[02:16:07.787 --> 02:16:09.108]  It says with an asterisk.
[02:16:10.226 --> 02:16:14.190]  When a gun is involved in illegal activity or in a crime.
[02:16:14.911 --> 02:16:18.054]  But the big message is, report illegal guns!
[02:16:20.877 --> 02:16:22.859]  It's all about perception.
[02:16:24.981 --> 02:16:33.730]  I have distant family and people that have been at my house and who have seen a Nerf gun.
[02:16:35.114 --> 02:16:35.674]  I mean, it's great.
[02:16:35.734 --> 02:16:37.215]  We run around the backyard, the front yard.
[02:16:37.235 --> 02:16:38.156]  Neighborhood kids have them.
[02:16:38.536 --> 02:16:39.537]  We have big Nerf battles.
[02:16:40.357 --> 02:16:42.098]  In fact, I plan to try to go home earlier today.
[02:16:43.439 --> 02:16:45.180]  My son's Nerf gun broke.
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:48.002]  You know, planned obsolescence, they break usually in a few months.
[02:16:48.583 --> 02:16:56.267]  So I'm gonna go buy him and my daughter, because hers I'm sure will break soon, a new Nerf gun and some new Nerf bullets.
[02:16:56.848 --> 02:16:57.928]  We're gonna go have a Nerf battle!
[02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:02.872]  Now, so-called liberal parents
[02:17:03.831 --> 02:17:08.054]  Don't think that a gun in the hands of the citizens, even a toy gun, is a devilish, evil weapon.
[02:17:08.334 --> 02:17:09.414]  They're scared to death of it.
[02:17:12.536 --> 02:17:17.299]  I've told the story one time of a well-known newspaper writer, now a magazine writer, at my parents' house.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:23.363]  I was in college, and the big gun case, I didn't keep my guns at home then.
[02:17:23.403 --> 02:17:24.624]  I went home to get a deer rifle.
[02:17:25.204 --> 02:17:26.525]  I pull up, say hi to them.
[02:17:27.585 --> 02:17:31.388]  I go in my parents' bedroom, do the combination, get a deer rifle out.
[02:17:32.267 --> 02:17:36.130]  There in the kitchen, he sees me walking by the doorway with a gun, and I hear like a shriek!
[02:17:37.532 --> 02:17:39.113]  And he says, is that a gun?
[02:17:39.133 --> 02:17:52.225]  And he starts getting up, he's all scared, white-faced, and I walk in and I say, don't worry, it's 243 for Small Deer in Texas, it's unloaded, I opened it up, lever action, savage, first-year rifle my dad got back in the 50s.
[02:17:52.845 --> 02:17:57.530]  I said, look, and he was, get out of here, please, get out of here, and he's not like what you think of as a cowardly person.
[02:17:58.908 --> 02:18:03.151]  He has imperial conditioning to be scared to death of a slave with a gun.
[02:18:03.171 --> 02:18:07.174]  Now he sees cops, SWAT teams, dogs, helicopters, troops, he feels good.
[02:18:08.495 --> 02:18:10.597]  He sees a slave with a gun, he gets scared.
[02:18:11.878 --> 02:18:14.500]  And he said, please, just get out of here, please, please, and I left.
[02:18:15.921 --> 02:18:26.890]  But I've seen people, I've seen family where my kids are going bang, bang, playing outside at a family event, and they get scared to death of that and act like some great offense has been committed.
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:29.680]  That is imperial conditioning.
[02:18:30.261 --> 02:18:37.803]  We are turning into a domesticated, jellyfish population that is being gelded.
[02:18:38.103 --> 02:18:40.024]  Now the kids can't play dodgeball.
[02:18:40.084 --> 02:18:41.304]  Then they can't play tag.
[02:18:41.624 --> 02:18:42.685]  Then they can't wrestle.
[02:18:42.725 --> 02:18:43.925]  Then they can't run.
[02:18:44.365 --> 02:18:45.666]  Most school districts have banned it.
[02:18:45.946 --> 02:18:47.486]  Now they can't even walk fast.
[02:18:47.546 --> 02:18:49.067]  Now some say they can't talk.
[02:18:49.407 --> 02:18:50.347]  They can't hug.
[02:18:50.627 --> 02:18:51.908]  They can't shake hands.
[02:18:52.988 --> 02:18:55.689]  They are the equivalent of supermax prisoners.
[02:18:57.697 --> 02:19:00.399]  Now on the airplanes you can't talk the last hour.
[02:19:00.419 --> 02:19:01.699]  You have to look straight forward.
[02:19:01.919 --> 02:19:05.121]  You can't cover your your knees with a blanket.
[02:19:05.461 --> 02:19:06.502]  You may be a terrorist.
[02:19:06.522 --> 02:19:08.403]  You can have no electronic device.
[02:19:08.903 --> 02:19:11.325]  All because of some guy with a firecracker in his underwear.
[02:19:11.865 --> 02:19:18.629]  This is the domestication scientifically to train us to be defenseless and to be gelded and to be weak.
[02:19:20.690 --> 02:19:25.893]  So go out and take physical jiu-jitsu or taekwondo or
[02:19:27.421 --> 02:19:28.484]  Whatever it is you like.
[02:19:28.524 --> 02:19:29.767]  Go take a boxing class.
[02:19:30.850 --> 02:19:31.932]  Go buy firearms.
[02:19:31.972 --> 02:19:33.256]  Take some safety courses.
[02:19:33.697 --> 02:19:34.779]  Get proficient with it.
[02:19:35.808 --> 02:19:37.690]  Store your firearms properly.
[02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:39.211]  We need a culture of liberty.
[02:19:39.511 --> 02:19:43.494]  It's like this Times of London story, and I've got similar articles out of the U.S.
[02:19:43.974 --> 02:19:47.457]  Children reaching age 3 without being able to say a word, survey finds.
[02:19:47.877 --> 02:19:49.338]  Now the government's going to get involved.
[02:19:49.579 --> 02:19:55.423]  Because of TV and the culture and the parents never being home, the children can't even talk.
[02:19:56.024 --> 02:19:58.085]  They're dumbing us down into mindless idiots.
[02:19:58.145 --> 02:19:58.826]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:00.236 --> 02:20:07.082]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:20:07.222 --> 02:20:09.164]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:20:09.304 --> 02:20:11.426]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:20:11.546 --> 02:20:13.047]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:20:13.207 --> 02:20:17.511]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:20:17.671 --> 02:20:20.053]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:20:20.234 --> 02:20:26.039]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[02:20:26.259 --> 02:20:31.004]  Their bestseller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:20:31.044 --> 02:20:33.786]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:20:33.886 --> 02:20:36.489]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:20:36.609 --> 02:20:37.910]  This system is free of chemicals.
[02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:38.250]  We're good.
[02:21:00.026 --> 02:21:03.889]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible, federal deficit spending?
[02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:08.273]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[02:21:08.393 --> 02:21:09.775]  You get less for your money.
[02:21:09.975 --> 02:21:15.840]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at MIDAS Resources.
[02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:15.900]  800-687-8000.
[02:21:17.301 --> 02:21:17.901]  Thank you.
[02:21:42.005 --> 02:21:44.786]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:44.806 --> 02:21:46.487]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:46.507 --> 02:21:47.808]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:11.179 --> 02:22:13.640]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:19.882]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:20.062 --> 02:22:25.084]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:25.604 --> 02:22:35.207]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:35.347 --> 02:22:37.469]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:37.689 --> 02:22:39.030]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:39.290 --> 02:22:41.552]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:41.752 --> 02:22:43.573]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:43.593 --> 02:22:48.677]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:49.018 --> 02:22:58.965]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:00.406 --> 02:23:01.067]  Studies have shown
[02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:09.110]  We're good to go.
[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:32.140]  We're good to go!
[02:24:14.093 --> 02:24:16.375]  That's right, we beat the Copenhagen scam.
[02:24:18.076 --> 02:24:21.158]  We got a long way to go and a short time to get there, but we're gonna do it.
[02:24:21.759 --> 02:24:23.580]  Put your foot down on the pedal, crank it up!
[02:24:25.501 --> 02:24:29.984]  So never mind them brakes, let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make.
[02:24:31.085 --> 02:24:35.068]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarkana.
[02:24:35.108 --> 02:24:40.372]  We're not running a truckload of Curious Why here, folks.
[02:24:41.032 --> 02:24:42.954]  We're running a truckload of liberty and freedom.
[02:24:44.096 --> 02:24:45.576]  In the Info War.
[02:24:46.456 --> 02:24:48.877]  You know, I've said it over and over again, and I'll say it again.
[02:24:51.877 --> 02:24:56.998]  The best thing we can do in the fight against the New World Order is get my documentary films.
[02:24:57.018 --> 02:25:01.799]  They're the most effective, the most powerful, the most accurate, and they wake people up.
[02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:06.080]  Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Terror Storm, Truth Rising.
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:07.700]  You don't have to buy one of them.
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:10.121]  They're all in decent quality on YouTube and Google.
[02:25:11.533 --> 02:25:16.757]  Take those URL links and email them every day out to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[02:25:17.098 --> 02:25:18.299]  They are waking people up.
[02:25:18.459 --> 02:25:20.580]  Or support us, buy the high quality DVDs.
[02:25:20.921 --> 02:25:23.062]  Got incredibly low prices at InfoWars.com.

[02:25:34.892 --> 02:25:35.713]  Give them to everybody.
[02:25:36.033 --> 02:25:36.693]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:25:38.775 --> 02:25:41.777]  Let's take a few more calls and I'm going to continue with the financial and global news.
[02:25:42.478 --> 02:25:47.722]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas, then Mordecai, Rick, Mark.
[02:25:47.822 --> 02:25:48.623]  Oh, Mark in Switzerland.
[02:25:48.663 --> 02:25:49.903]  I'm going to skip ahead to him in a minute.
[02:25:50.324 --> 02:25:51.325]  John in Tejas.
[02:25:51.345 --> 02:25:51.905]  You're on the air.
[02:25:51.965 --> 02:25:52.385]  Go ahead.
[02:25:53.606 --> 02:25:54.027]  Hey, Alex.
[02:25:54.707 --> 02:25:59.110]  I have a comment to make concerning a statement that your last guest had made.
[02:26:00.471 --> 02:26:01.312]  That's Lord Monckton?
[02:26:02.253 --> 02:26:02.513]  Right.
[02:26:03.474 --> 02:26:06.256]  He was encouraging everybody to call the representatives.
[02:26:07.014 --> 02:26:13.778]  And to let them know, hey, if we have to have world governance, you know, let's have it, you know, elect them.
[02:26:14.979 --> 02:26:28.867]  And I know it's pretty obvious for, I think, most Americans and definitely your listeners, here in the United States, you know, with our local, state, and federal politicians, we're having a hard enough time trying to get honest
[02:26:30.018 --> 02:26:31.338]  People elected as it is.
[02:26:31.678 --> 02:26:33.219]  Yeah, John, I think you're missing the point.
[02:26:33.239 --> 02:26:34.939]  He said we're obviously against it.
[02:26:35.019 --> 02:26:35.799]  It's tyrannical.
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:40.841]  The issue is they couldn't get the countries to sign on, even though that was a fraud.
[02:26:41.121 --> 02:26:42.361]  Now they're just doing it.
[02:26:42.401 --> 02:26:43.281]  It's open tyranny.
[02:26:43.581 --> 02:26:48.242]  That way you educate people along what's really happening.
[02:26:50.243 --> 02:26:50.803]  You understand?
[02:26:50.823 --> 02:26:56.664]  I mean, we're pointing out that we're going into global governance and government without even being able to vote on it.
[02:26:56.684 --> 02:26:58.765]  No, I understand.
[02:26:58.785 --> 02:26:59.325]  That's fine.
[02:27:00.117 --> 02:27:03.222]  But it just, you know, I think any form of...
[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:06.881]  Global governance, you know, people should fight against it worldwide.
[02:27:06.921 --> 02:27:12.503]  Yes, national sovereignty is a firewall against tyranny, and no one wants global government, neither does Lord Monckton.
[02:27:12.543 --> 02:27:18.526]  It was a debate tool, and I agree with him to say, look, we're going to have this, you know, we should be able to vote on it.
[02:27:18.666 --> 02:27:20.186]  We should decide if we want to be part of it.
[02:27:20.646 --> 02:27:22.627]  But I hear you, and I appreciate your call, John.
[02:27:22.907 --> 02:27:24.488]  Mordecai in Israel.
[02:27:24.508 --> 02:27:27.309]  We've got callers from all over the place, and then Mark in Switzerland.
[02:27:28.269 --> 02:27:29.330]  Mordecai, you're on the air.
[02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:30.730]  Yes, hello, Alex.
[02:27:31.310 --> 02:27:31.591]  Hey, buddy.
[02:27:34.197 --> 02:27:49.360]  I would like to let you know that, thanks to you, I watched Jesse Ventura's documentary dealing with the September 11th attacks conspiracy theory, and I would like to call your attention to a detail that the research team may have overlooked.
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:53.481]  It's something that jumped out at me when I watched the documentary.
[02:27:53.541 --> 02:27:58.742]  Namely, that's the ownership of Hangar 17, where the only known evidence
[02:27:59.502 --> 02:28:03.184]  From 9-11 still in existence is locked away from public scrutiny.
[02:28:04.025 --> 02:28:11.209]  Yes, and Giuliani signed a mayoral decree that no one can ever get it and that he, after being out of office, controls it.
[02:28:11.489 --> 02:28:17.353]  How does a mayor give himself power and control and basic ownership over something after he leaves?
[02:28:18.553 --> 02:28:19.294]  Very interesting.
[02:28:20.074 --> 02:28:22.115]  Well, the thing that jumped out at me was this.
[02:28:22.416 --> 02:28:28.139]  When Jesse's camera team viewed the building from a certain angle,
[02:28:28.877 --> 02:28:35.122]  Hangar 17 in JFK Airport has a prominent unfaded billboard that says Tower Air.
[02:28:36.023 --> 02:28:39.005]  Now anyone can go and look in YouTube and they can see it there.
[02:28:39.085 --> 02:28:42.788]  Tower Airlines was an Israeli airline that went bankrupt in 2000.
[02:28:43.488 --> 02:28:51.094]  And it's none other than that building, Hangar 17, that housed Tower Air's then brand new corporate headquarters.
[02:28:51.495 --> 02:28:52.255]  I did not know that.
[02:28:52.315 --> 02:28:56.639]  Somebody should write up an article about that and we'd post it at InfoWars.com.
[02:28:59.139 --> 02:29:21.026]  My question is this, why does 9-11 evidentiary material that would provide clues such as the absence or presence of super thermite or other explosive materials and the dust from the blast sit there for safekeeping in the former executive headquarters of a 10-year defunct Israeli front organization that contracted heavily for the U.S.
[02:29:21.066 --> 02:29:25.187]  Defense Department and it still has an unfaded sign hanging on the building?
[02:29:27.129 --> 02:29:29.690]  Sir, write it up, write it up and we'll post it.
[02:29:29.930 --> 02:29:41.634]  You know, get the video clip or links to it or screenshots and we'll link to it or somebody, I don't have that many writers, but if somebody will put it together, send it to ShowTips or writers at InfoWars.com, we'll get that up.
[02:29:41.674 --> 02:29:42.594]  Anything else Mordecai?
[02:29:44.495 --> 02:29:48.436]  Uh, well Alex, uh, you know... Stay there!
[02:29:50.317 --> 02:29:53.218]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.236 --> 02:29:56.977]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:04.727]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:04.867 --> 02:31:06.830]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:09.233]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:09.393 --> 02:31:11.256]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:11.676 --> 02:31:13.018]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:13.298 --> 02:31:14.340]  There is a solution.
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:22.563]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:59.517 --> 02:32:03.759]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:04.680]  Number one.
[02:32:04.980 --> 02:32:08.142]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:08.422 --> 02:32:08.982]  Number two.
[02:32:09.263 --> 02:32:13.825]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.165 --> 02:32:14.626]  It's true.
[02:32:14.906 --> 02:32:19.488]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.769 --> 02:32:20.309]  Number three.
[02:32:20.589 --> 02:32:23.892]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.172 --> 02:32:28.655]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.896 --> 02:32:31.277]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:31.658 --> 02:32:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.121 --> 02:32:40.044]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.264 --> 02:32:45.028]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:45.308 --> 02:32:49.351]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:49.492 --> 02:32:51.053]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.293 --> 02:32:55.877]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:06.676 --> 02:33:11.838]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[02:33:12.258 --> 02:33:16.419]  I've never been with... Okay, quickly, Mordecai and Israel, finish up your point.
[02:33:16.439 --> 02:33:18.880]  I'm gonna go to a few more calls and get into some financial news.
[02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:21.401]  I asked if you had anything else to add.
[02:33:21.441 --> 02:33:21.841]  Go ahead.
[02:33:22.401 --> 02:33:24.002]  Yes, just very very quickly.
[02:33:24.082 --> 02:33:27.143]  I've been hesitating to say this on your show for a long time.
[02:33:28.390 --> 02:33:32.952]  Because I do the same kind of work that you do here in Israel for more than 12 years I've been doing this.
[02:33:33.132 --> 02:33:56.603]  When I heard a guy call earlier and say your show was entertaining, despite the fact that they've destroyed my family and it's a whole different thing that you have no time for on the show right now, but I had to call and say this when I heard somebody say that you treat your show as entertainment when it's so dead serious and everybody in the world is suffering from what they're doing.
[02:33:58.060 --> 02:34:06.226]  The closer that somebody approaches the truth, the more danger there is for the person to be called a provocateur.
[02:34:06.546 --> 02:34:13.090]  Because there are certain things that if I were to say here in Israel about Israel, I would be promptly arrested.
[02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:17.974]  And if you would say it in America about America, you would also get a visit.
[02:34:18.094 --> 02:34:20.636]  You know, and you've said you've gotten death threats and things like that.
[02:34:21.383 --> 02:34:49.015]  But eventually, and this is a question really rather than a comment or a statement, because people talk about their arms being taken away and the danger of their taking away our guns, but at one point somebody's going to have to address the issue of who gets to give the orders to fire and when and under what circumstances.
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:53.402]  And when is that going to happen?
[02:34:53.942 --> 02:34:55.603]  Who are going to be the people?
[02:34:56.244 --> 02:35:00.106]  Because it's not enough and it's not sufficient just to own the guns.
[02:35:00.667 --> 02:35:13.076]  And just waving the guns and just owning them, at one point someone's going to have to use them and somebody's going to have to determine who are the commanders, who are the people who are... I mean, you get my point, right?
[02:35:14.017 --> 02:35:15.358]  Mordecai, I do get your point.
[02:35:15.398 --> 02:35:16.338]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:17.697 --> 02:35:23.162]  Answering that question, thousands of pieces of data, common sense, history come into play.
[02:35:24.283 --> 02:35:26.865]  The military and the police are starting to wake up.
[02:35:27.866 --> 02:35:33.610]  The governments of the world have done everything they can to brainwash them and turn them against the people and the people against the police and military.
[02:35:34.771 --> 02:35:39.976]  The last thing we need is offensive attacks on the criminal government.
[02:35:40.256 --> 02:35:42.458]  They have to stage events against themselves
[02:35:43.999 --> 02:35:50.683]  As a pretext to build up a police state, knowing that people will be forced to resist them, so they can then call that terrorism.
[02:35:54.025 --> 02:36:01.570]  And it is really up to listeners to decide, are they going to let their kids be taken away to jail for no reason?
[02:36:02.171 --> 02:36:07.254]  If there's a mass plague released, a bioweapon released, Obama's saying, you know, get the U.S.
[02:36:07.294 --> 02:36:08.395]  ready for bio-attack.
[02:36:08.715 --> 02:36:10.796]  They could use that as a pretext to bring in control.
[02:36:11.457 --> 02:36:13.078]  Financial collapse, all of this.
[02:36:14.124 --> 02:36:25.746]  For me, it's defensive because you're not going to take the government back when it's illegitimate, built into doubts and underground bases and facilities by going around and having war with a bunch of their minions.
[02:36:28.046 --> 02:36:34.228]  You need to reach out now and educate people in the system how they've been controlled and show them the bigger picture.
[02:36:35.628 --> 02:36:40.649]  And I don't just say that because I'm afraid of getting arrested, as you alluded to.
[02:36:41.209 --> 02:36:41.889]  If I got up
[02:36:42.961 --> 02:36:46.042]  On air and did call for violent confrontation.
[02:36:46.662 --> 02:36:47.502]  What are the targets?
[02:36:50.603 --> 02:36:57.585]  I mean, if the police started running around arresting citizens with no evidence, which they're starting to do slowly, but in mass and taking them to a FEMA center.
[02:36:58.886 --> 02:37:04.127]  I mean, I mean, I'm already getting here to the point of saying I'm going to have to go into airports when they try to body scan me and say no.
[02:37:05.588 --> 02:37:09.649]  And Lord knows what they'll charge me with then, but it's getting to the point where you have to say no.
[02:37:11.049 --> 02:37:12.450]  And then what do you do?
[02:37:15.092 --> 02:37:28.077]  I genuinely know that we have to identify the criminal element first to slow them down so we can stop their agenda politically.
[02:37:28.717 --> 02:37:37.820]  And see, by them forcing much of their agenda, even when we politically beat it, or no matter who gets into political office, the system just goes forward, that's waking people up now.
[02:37:39.209 --> 02:37:41.590]  The globalists want insurrection.
[02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:46.453]  They don't care if your average police officer gets killed or somebody in the military.
[02:37:46.893 --> 02:37:47.553]  They want that.
[02:37:47.993 --> 02:37:49.414]  They want to get us fighting with each other.
[02:37:49.814 --> 02:37:52.476]  So I am not for a violent confrontation with the government.
[02:37:53.676 --> 02:38:01.000]  That said, I'm not going to be drug away to some FEMA center for my political speech and nobody's putting their hands on my children.
[02:38:02.686 --> 02:38:11.571]  And the system has been running into people defensively defending themselves, and the system's starting to get the message and backing off on many fronts.
[02:38:13.773 --> 02:38:20.797]  And that's a sad thing that people in the system are... I mean, a lot of CPS workers are getting killed now.
[02:38:21.417 --> 02:38:24.199]  You notice they don't hype that up in the media, it's just a little blurb.
[02:38:24.719 --> 02:38:30.403]  But every few days I see where CPS get filled full of holes by people that don't want to give their children over to them.
[02:38:33.007 --> 02:38:39.274]  But that is making them, in many respects, start following the Constitution, due process, Bill of Rights.
[02:38:43.399 --> 02:38:46.402]  The system, though, then uses that to further militarize police.
[02:38:47.163 --> 02:38:49.526]  So it's a very heavy, heavy issue you raise.
[02:38:51.121 --> 02:39:03.429]  And I've thought about trying to do a several hour special on it, and I've done the research, but to recompile the research, because I get a piece here, a piece there of my research, and to try to lay out, I guess you're saying the rules of engagement.
[02:39:04.610 --> 02:39:08.692]  And the Pentagon itself says 90% of war is psychological.
[02:39:09.333 --> 02:39:11.074]  We have the truth, they have the lies.
[02:39:11.894 --> 02:39:12.575]  And so we better
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:25.630]  Work for peace, and work for waking the system up, and work for getting our counties and states and cities back, as we're doing here in the United States, and exhaust all of those avenues.
[02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:32.536]  And then when they come to take your farm or ranch because you can't pay the giant taxes they've levied, that's up to you to make your personal decision.
[02:39:33.116 --> 02:39:41.023]  I'll tell you, and I'm sad for the police and military and bureaucrats, because most of them are just dumbed-down fools that think they have the authority of God.
[02:39:43.001 --> 02:40:10.751]  A lot of people have made the decision, mainly it's a lot of old Korean War vets, most of the WWII vets have died off, but I've seen this as a trend, as a profile, of the police harass them, they stop them, they harass them, and a lot of, this happened a few years ago in Austin, this old WWII vet told the state police guy that was involved harassing him and trying to take his property, it came out in the news, he told him, he said, listen buddy, you pull me over for no reason one more time, and there's going to be trouble.
[02:40:11.432 --> 02:40:12.252]  And he killed him.
[02:40:15.584 --> 02:40:22.708]  And that's what the servants of the tyrants need to get their heads screwed on and really understand.
[02:40:23.008 --> 02:40:25.109]  They're pushing people that can't be pushed anymore.
[02:40:26.269 --> 02:40:30.031]  They're pushing people that have just made the decision, OK, I'm dead.
[02:40:30.051 --> 02:40:30.872]  I don't care.
[02:40:31.372 --> 02:40:35.114]  Next person in government treads on me, I'm going to get violent.
[02:40:36.234 --> 02:40:37.215]  That's what people are saying.
[02:40:39.710 --> 02:40:47.961]  And now conservatives and libertarians have seen the government documents that we were given, that we released, where they are listed as the real terrorist and the real enemy.
[02:40:48.181 --> 02:40:51.606]  Well, that lets you know this government is the real terrorist and is illegitimate.
[02:40:54.289 --> 02:40:56.370]  But whoever fires first loses.
[02:40:56.730 --> 02:40:57.850]  That's been said many times.
[02:40:58.550 --> 02:41:03.372]  And I'm old enough, that's why the military wants people 18 to 25.
[02:41:03.832 --> 02:41:09.954]  Because they're young, they think they're bulletproof, they think manliness is just going out and having a war and having a firefight.
[02:41:12.375 --> 02:41:18.737]  But even when I was younger, I had read enough history and studied it to know that no, we don't fight on their terms.
[02:41:19.417 --> 02:41:22.358]  We don't go out and just get in a war with the establishment for no reason.
[02:41:23.346 --> 02:41:29.752]  Or do it in a way that will empower their police state and legitimize this control grid they've laboriously built?
[02:41:29.772 --> 02:41:41.603]  It's a very, very important question and maybe we should do a whole show sometime, maybe this week, do a couple hours, just opening the phones up about what's your line in the sand.
[02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:55.235]  The bureaucrats need to know that the system isn't building FEMA camps and setting up checkpoints and putting in tracking grids for no reason.
[02:41:55.876 --> 02:41:58.698]  They know that they were going to carry out a criminal banking heist.
[02:41:58.778 --> 02:42:00.099]  I told you this ten years ago.
[02:42:01.178 --> 02:42:05.239]  And we're only entering this that would be so big, people would start resisting.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:20.325]  That's why they take select cops from all over the country and fly them to different G20 events and other globalist events and have them attack old ladies with police dogs and sound cannon populations and they send sound cannons to menace tea parties in San Diego.
[02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:27.571]  Because they're gearing up and getting their people ready and trained to engage the population.
[02:42:28.051 --> 02:42:38.734]  I think if we have a real war, a real guerrilla war, and of 150 million gun owners, only 1% decide to go out and only engage people one time?
[02:42:40.954 --> 02:42:43.275]  That's 1,500,000 dead cops.
[02:42:45.415 --> 02:42:48.156]  That's half the cops in the country dead in one day.
[02:42:56.113 --> 02:42:58.715]  And we have a lot more than 1% that are ready to go.
[02:42:59.456 --> 02:43:00.637]  And the system knows that.
[02:43:02.599 --> 02:43:21.875]  But thank God people have shown great restraint because the globalists in public documents, public statements, we had Colonel Roberts on a few weeks ago about this, are training to bring in I-4 and multinational troops, and they've trained for it under NLE-09 and other FEMA drills last year, that they want that to happen.
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:30.906]  I have said many times it's better that a hundred guilty men go free than one innocent man be executed or imprisoned.
[02:43:31.767 --> 02:43:34.490]  And it turns out over a third of people on death row are innocent.
[02:43:34.810 --> 02:43:36.452]  The DNA proves it.
[02:43:36.712 --> 02:43:39.134]  Or people later confess and the DNA proves it as well.
[02:43:40.055 --> 02:43:42.498]  So I can't sit here and pass judgment
[02:43:43.758 --> 02:43:43.898]  on
[02:44:04.833 --> 02:44:11.119]  Dr. Paul Craig Robertson last week, former head of the Treasury, former Wall Street Journal editor, listing names of U.S.
[02:44:11.139 --> 02:44:16.704]  citizens arrested under the Patriot Act, held without trial for many years, tortured.
[02:44:19.426 --> 02:44:20.267]  This is admitted.
[02:44:20.307 --> 02:44:22.489]  I mean, we have slid so far.
[02:44:24.891 --> 02:44:27.294]  And the system is creating a Hobson's Choice.
[02:44:28.973 --> 02:44:33.356]  But as for me, I see us making giant headway peaceably.
[02:44:33.997 --> 02:44:36.778]  And the system desperately wants to make it violent.
[02:44:37.679 --> 02:44:40.721]  The system wants to get a fight started with the American people.
[02:44:41.602 --> 02:44:42.322]  Against each other.
[02:44:43.423 --> 02:44:46.405]  Brother against brother, father against son.
[02:44:46.425 --> 02:44:51.509]  I know the average police officer didn't become a police officer because they wanted to be a bully.
[02:44:51.849 --> 02:44:53.150]  I know they promote the bullies though.
[02:44:54.713 --> 02:44:56.735]  I know most departments have become very corrupt.
[02:44:56.935 --> 02:45:02.581]  The rank and file aren't, but mid-level and high-level, it's narcotics, trafficking, prostitution, every major city, they're always getting caught.
[02:45:03.261 --> 02:45:05.584]  They're getting caught, though, because the system isn't totally corrupt.
[02:45:06.404 --> 02:45:08.667]  It's a problem of all of our conscience.
[02:45:08.767 --> 02:45:12.010]  It's a problem of all of our morals that has let us get to this point.
[02:45:16.638 --> 02:45:26.523]  And so I just can't sit here and pass judgment and say, oh, anybody in a uniform's bad, even if that uniform's been taken over by evil.
[02:45:33.447 --> 02:45:35.068]  And this country still has a lot of freedom.
[02:45:35.268 --> 02:45:36.889]  It still has a lot of good people in government.
[02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:38.850]  There's a reason I'm still on the air.
[02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:40.231]  There's a reason I haven't been killed.
[02:45:41.035 --> 02:45:41.676]  There's a reason.
[02:45:41.736 --> 02:45:47.700]  God's protecting me, but also there are a lot of good people in the system, and they're finally waking up like the population.
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:49.081]  They're just like everybody else.
[02:45:49.662 --> 02:45:52.143]  So the globalists are in a race to start a shooting war.
[02:45:52.564 --> 02:45:55.626]  You know, we don't have a big staff, and that's why I try to raise money here.
[02:45:57.007 --> 02:46:04.353]  I probably need to have four or five employees that just sit there on the message board in the comments banning people and restricting people.
[02:46:06.738 --> 02:46:12.563]  Because there are people in there trying to stir up a shooting war, people trying to provocateur, trying to set people up.
[02:46:13.924 --> 02:46:18.989]  And when we have done spot checks of their IP addresses, it'll be the same 15, 20 people.
[02:46:20.010 --> 02:46:24.053]  They come on on shifts, IPs for eight hours, another IP for eight hours.
[02:46:24.914 --> 02:46:27.236]  They're running several shifts a day.
[02:46:28.557 --> 02:46:32.521]  And their IPs go back to proxy server blocks.
[02:46:34.090 --> 02:46:37.913]  And then we've got other tricks we can do where we can tell that's going back to government and corporate servers.
[02:46:38.313 --> 02:46:50.162]  The government is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com trying to get people to talk about killing and saying Alex is a wimp, Alex isn't tough, Alex isn't out calling for war.
[02:46:52.223 --> 02:46:52.864]  They're feds.
[02:46:53.184 --> 02:46:54.865]  Now I told you Hal Turner was a fed.
[02:46:55.365 --> 02:46:57.407]  They've now released the court transcript of the U.S.
[02:46:57.447 --> 02:47:00.149]  Attorney and FBI admitting he was above
[02:47:01.616 --> 02:47:06.278]  above the regular FBI in national security.
[02:47:07.598 --> 02:47:10.319]  Now, he threatened and said go after a bunch of federal judges.
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:13.020]  The states indicted him, showing the power of the states.
[02:47:14.021 --> 02:47:16.162]  And the states complied and put him in irons.
[02:47:17.522 --> 02:47:19.583]  But it's come out, and this came out last week.
[02:47:19.603 --> 02:47:21.464]  It came out a few months ago in court.
[02:47:21.584 --> 02:47:22.864]  He said he was, his lawyers did.
[02:47:23.124 --> 02:47:27.406]  It's now in the transcript on InfoWars.com from the federal courthouse.
[02:47:27.526 --> 02:47:29.527]  Most of it's redacted under national security.
[02:47:30.899 --> 02:47:33.060]  A national security letter went out to that judge.
[02:47:33.380 --> 02:47:35.781]  This guy is ultra-operative.
[02:47:37.262 --> 02:47:50.427]  Well, of course, they want to make it racial so that other people hear about the New World Order, anti-New World Order movement, and then think, well, I'm not getting involved with that.
[02:47:50.467 --> 02:47:52.288]  It's all about killing judges and Jews.
[02:47:54.915 --> 02:48:01.777]  We have caught white supremacist leaders over and over and over again in the US, Canada, England, and Germany in mainstream news.
[02:48:02.378 --> 02:48:06.619]  Not just infiltrating, but founding and running the white supremacist groups.
[02:48:08.019 --> 02:48:12.501]  All the major white supremacist websites are run by the feds.
[02:48:14.181 --> 02:48:15.922]  We've identified what they're doing.
[02:48:15.962 --> 02:48:18.303]  I mean, we don't just get up here and say this stuff.
[02:48:19.986 --> 02:48:25.247]  If you're not a Fed, folks, you can't get up on the air and say go out and kill federal judges.
[02:48:27.948 --> 02:48:29.568]  He did that for over a decade.
[02:48:29.848 --> 02:48:36.370]  The Feds are in court arguing for him at national security level of the FBI saying he is an agent.
[02:48:38.130 --> 02:48:40.191]  And they're trying to get him off right now quietly.
[02:48:40.211 --> 02:48:41.331]  This is a big embarrassment.
[02:48:42.111 --> 02:48:43.352]  Every few months I see articles.
[02:48:43.372 --> 02:48:44.852]  They had a big one last year out of
[02:48:47.096 --> 02:48:48.477]  The Orlando Sentinel.
[02:48:48.557 --> 02:48:52.440]  We're the founder of the big white supremacist group and the guy leading it's FBI informant.
[02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:53.881]  It's all run by them.
[02:48:54.322 --> 02:48:56.143]  And notice the biggest group attacking me.
[02:48:57.184 --> 02:49:02.208]  Telling all these lies, making things up about me, manufacturing completely fake, made up garbage.
[02:49:03.675 --> 02:49:07.156]  Saying I work for Israel, or I work for the Pope, or I work for this or that?
[02:49:07.477 --> 02:49:10.458]  I don't work for any of those people but Alex Jones and the Constitution.
[02:49:11.218 --> 02:49:12.819]  Look at the fruits that we've bore.
[02:49:12.879 --> 02:49:14.379]  Look at the people we've woken up.
[02:49:14.659 --> 02:49:15.680]  Look at what we've done.
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:28.005]  And I have ridden this razor edge trying to stay afloat, trying to operate, trying to stop infiltration, trying to stop the attempted set-ups, the physical attacks, the stuff I don't spend a lot of time on.
[02:49:29.690 --> 02:49:31.571]  I mean, I am a warrior, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:32.251 --> 02:49:33.492]  I am committed to this fight.
[02:49:34.232 --> 02:49:35.553]  And I'm committed wherever it leads me.
[02:49:35.633 --> 02:49:37.033]  I'm ready for whatever they do to me.
[02:49:42.016 --> 02:49:52.020]  I remember two years ago, three years ago now, one of the head torturers at an airbase in Afghanistan tortured some people to death.
[02:49:53.541 --> 02:49:57.383]  And the headline was, head prison guard
[02:49:58.385 --> 02:49:59.606]  I'm going to give you the exact headline.
[02:50:01.326 --> 02:50:04.408]  Prison guard charged under Patriot Act.
[02:50:04.528 --> 02:50:05.848]  Or gagged under Patriot Act.
[02:50:06.068 --> 02:50:08.329]  And he came out with his letters where he was ordered to torture.
[02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:12.191]  And they charged him with the Patriot Act to shut him up.
[02:50:12.451 --> 02:50:14.492]  Listen to all you Nazi handlers out there.
[02:50:15.212 --> 02:50:17.313]  They'll blow up a building and say you did it.
[02:50:17.353 --> 02:50:21.115]  Later it doesn't matter if you're an FBI agent like Turner or an informant.
[02:50:21.395 --> 02:50:24.837]  Tim McVeigh is now sworn in federal court, was what we told you he was.
[02:50:25.157 --> 02:50:27.538]  Black ops, super secret, national security.
[02:50:29.295 --> 02:50:32.377]  They set him up and drugged his butt up and executed his butt.
[02:50:34.458 --> 02:50:36.880]  Told him he'll murder your family if you don't keep your mouth shut.
[02:50:38.821 --> 02:50:45.285]  All of you people serving this, and all of you that are paid to attack me, you're not having success.
[02:50:45.345 --> 02:50:46.926]  People now know who you are.
[02:50:48.447 --> 02:50:50.888]  And so to all the COINTELPRO, we've identified you.
[02:50:51.229 --> 02:50:55.071]  And they are discussing and threatening to use white supremacy to kill me right now.
[02:50:55.531 --> 02:50:56.572]  Whatever happens, happens.
[02:50:56.632 --> 02:50:58.173]  If the feds kill me, they kill me.
[02:51:00.839 --> 02:51:02.080]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:51:02.601 --> 02:51:04.663]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[02:51:05.003 --> 02:51:08.026]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[02:51:08.566 --> 02:51:12.810]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[02:51:13.351 --> 02:51:18.516]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[02:51:19.096 --> 02:51:23.318]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[02:51:23.598 --> 02:51:29.620]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[02:51:30.041 --> 02:51:31.281]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[02:51:31.681 --> 02:51:37.784]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[02:51:38.144 --> 02:51:39.805]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[02:51:40.185 --> 02:51:45.227]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[02:51:45.547 --> 02:51:48.148]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[02:51:48.428 --> 02:51:50.569]  Call 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:51:50.850 --> 02:51:52.911]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.

[02:52:01.376 --> 02:52:05.059]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:05.399 --> 02:52:08.401]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:08.641 --> 02:52:10.042]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:10.757 --> 02:52:13.418]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:13.438 --> 02:52:19.660]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:24.862]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:24.882 --> 02:52:34.986]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:35.106 --> 02:52:37.227]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:37.447 --> 02:52:38.788]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.048 --> 02:52:41.329]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:41.509 --> 02:52:43.349]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:43.630 --> 02:52:48.432]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:48.772 --> 02:52:57.896]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:59.813 --> 02:53:04.058]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:53:04.378 --> 02:53:08.463]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:53:08.723 --> 02:53:13.609]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to use.
[02:53:16.772 --> 02:53:17.332]  We're good to go!
[02:53:45.609 --> 02:53:49.650]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:51.351]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:53:51.571 --> 02:53:53.672]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:53:53.812 --> 02:53:56.093]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:53:56.113 --> 02:53:56.753]  Front porch sittin',
[02:54:27.249 --> 02:54:32.872]  I want to finish up with Mark in Switzerland very quickly and then hit some financial news in the last three or four minutes.
[02:54:33.412 --> 02:54:34.653]  Mark in Switzerland, go ahead.
[02:54:35.253 --> 02:54:36.033]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:54:36.254 --> 02:54:37.894]  I wanted to just share something with you.
[02:54:38.355 --> 02:54:44.658]  I attended a dinner in Geneva a couple of months ago and at this event was someone who worked for a very large
[02:54:45.433 --> 02:54:46.133]  Swiss Bank.
[02:54:46.794 --> 02:55:14.766]  And he made the claim that the put options on the airlines in September 2001 were actually executed in Switzerland and that FINMA, which is the equivalent of the SEC, the Swiss Securities Overseer, which is a federal agency, called FINMA, F-I-N-M-A, has all this information and they're just sitting on it.
[02:55:15.236 --> 02:55:17.457]  Yeah, no, it came out in the German and a few U.S.
[02:55:17.517 --> 02:55:17.937]  papers.
[02:55:18.017 --> 02:55:19.318]  Wall Street Journal was one.
[02:55:19.758 --> 02:55:22.159]  Record put options against American and United.
[02:55:22.279 --> 02:55:23.979]  Record in the week before.
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:31.342]  And that it led back to Alex Brown-Deutsch and Buzzy Krongaard, who later became Executive Director of the CIA.
[02:55:31.662 --> 02:55:32.723]  I'd love to hear more on that.
[02:55:32.743 --> 02:55:33.623]  We're out of time, Mark.
[02:55:33.683 --> 02:55:34.123]  Thank you.
[02:55:34.423 --> 02:55:35.524]  And I'm sorry to other callers.
[02:55:35.564 --> 02:55:43.407]  I wanted to briefly, at the end of the show here, thank all of you for your support, for spreading the word about the free podcast at InfoWars.com and the Listen page.
[02:55:44.471 --> 02:55:50.758]  We promise to make this year even more powerful and more focused, and we want to commend the great crew and the job they did last year going into this year.
[02:55:50.858 --> 02:55:57.165]  In closing, I wanted to thank Ted Anderson for all of his support of the network and his company Midas Resources.
[02:55:57.666 --> 02:55:59.047]  And Ted, gold's up over $20 today.
[02:56:00.709 --> 02:56:04.091]  You have some great deals you're able to buy when gold dipped for a few weeks.
[02:56:04.111 --> 02:56:06.433]  You're able to pass those on to people.
[02:56:07.173 --> 02:56:08.854]  But the real economy is imploding.
[02:56:09.635 --> 02:56:10.715]  The banks are looting us.
[02:56:10.795 --> 02:56:12.456]  People need to get into silver and gold.
[02:56:12.516 --> 02:56:16.018]  It's up over 400% in the last seven, eight years, as you know.
[02:56:16.879 --> 02:56:18.800]  And I believe it's just going to continue to grow.
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:22.882]  But regardless, it can't be devalued overnight like paper money.
[02:56:22.943 --> 02:56:27.745]  Ted Anderson, tell us about the specials you have here at the close of the first weekday broadcast of 2010.
[02:56:28.922 --> 02:56:30.203]  Well, I know time is tight.
[02:56:30.343 --> 02:56:35.828]  And yeah, indeed, I was buying secretly, I guess quietly, while the prices were down here the last couple of weeks.
[02:56:36.709 --> 02:56:40.152]  Just because economics haven't changed, we're going to have more trouble in the future.
[02:56:40.733 --> 02:56:45.557]  I highly suspect that we'll see $1,300 gold before spring has passed.
[02:56:45.617 --> 02:56:48.540]  So, I would really recommend that people get in.
[02:56:48.580 --> 02:56:51.883]  We do have some really good buys in the British Sovereigns right now.
[02:56:51.923 --> 02:56:53.884]  The dollar's dropping again, I should add that.
[02:56:53.925 --> 02:56:54.225]  Go ahead.
[02:56:54.525 --> 02:56:55.606]  Yeah, dollars dropping.
[02:56:56.067 --> 02:56:59.230]  I mean, we have $10 Liberties, $10 Indians.
[02:56:59.270 --> 02:57:03.674]  We also have the British Sovereign and the Frank, which were bought when the market was lower.
[02:57:04.255 --> 02:57:05.056]  They're currently right now $2.60, $3.22.
[02:57:05.136 --> 02:57:06.857]  I do have the Montana Silver at $20.99.
[02:57:11.602 --> 02:57:13.663]  It's kind of like taking advantage of it right now.
[02:57:14.063 --> 02:57:16.405]  We're at that $1,120 level.
[02:57:16.425 --> 02:57:18.446]  $1,124 for a high today.
[02:57:18.906 --> 02:57:22.208]  And we were looking at $1,080 here just about a week ago.
[02:57:22.308 --> 02:57:28.091]  So that gives you an idea of what the prices are doing and where I expect them to go.
[02:57:28.111 --> 02:57:31.273]  I look to see about a $30 increase from where I'm at right now.
[02:57:31.841 --> 02:57:36.603]  So the discount you're putting out, you bought gold and silver at what?
[02:57:36.923 --> 02:57:39.784]  And now it's gone way up, and you're again passing that savings on.
[02:57:40.064 --> 02:57:41.945]  So tell us the type of savings people are getting.
[02:57:42.205 --> 02:57:47.026]  Well, that $11.80, $11.90 is where we've seen the low, and that's when I was buying.
[02:57:47.086 --> 02:57:49.547]  So right now we're sitting in a position, we even have U.S.
[02:57:49.647 --> 02:57:56.170]  Eagles that are sitting at what I would consider a below market price, just due to the fact that the prices were lower.
[02:57:56.290 --> 02:57:58.510]  We've seen gold go up about $30.
[02:58:00.091 --> 02:58:00.751]  $40 actually.
[02:58:01.151 --> 02:58:05.532]  Absolutely, and people should take advantage of this and tell them it's the Alex Jones Ted Anderson special.
[02:58:05.793 --> 02:58:07.253]  Be able to get these lower prices.
[02:58:07.293 --> 02:58:11.874]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists have been trying with both feet to stop the price of gold down.
[02:58:12.254 --> 02:58:13.735]  We believe they're going to be unsuccessful.
[02:58:14.275 --> 02:58:17.116]  We believe that people need to get involved in gold and silver today.
[02:58:17.436 --> 02:58:20.496]  A true store of wealth, a hedge against inflation and uncertainty.
[02:58:20.516 --> 02:58:20.716]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:20.756 --> 02:58:24.237]  Here's the number again.
