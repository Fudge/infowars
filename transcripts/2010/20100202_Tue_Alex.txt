[00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:09.921]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:11.383]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:13.064]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:17.388]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.973]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:41.211]  We are now simulcasting the last three hours of this Tuesday, 2nd day of February 2010 edition at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:46.092]  Thank you so much radio listeners and TV viewers for tuning in today.
[00:00:46.892 --> 00:00:54.453]  For the next hour, we are joined by Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, an excellent analysis and news site.
[00:00:54.473 --> 00:00:58.554]  We always enjoy having him on with us once a month.
[00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:01.635]  I want to go over internet censorship.
[00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:10.661]  Openly being announced, openly being pushed, and declared by Italy, Australia, New Zealand, England.
[00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:14.504]  Cyber securities are resigning, saying it's a Pentagon takeover.
[00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:20.629]  South Australia government gags internet debate about political candidates now not allowed.
[00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.291]  That's the news of Australia, mainstream media.
[00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.272]  I mean, this is getting insane.
[00:01:26.332 --> 00:01:29.833]  I want to talk about Obama's new giant tax program.
[00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:39.037]  I want to get into the banks calling for a global regulatory body to punish the banks, just like the Federal Reserve was supposed to punish the banks when it really gave them power.
[00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:40.918]  They want world government one way or the other.
[00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:48.641]  We're going to be breaking it all down today and taking your phone calls with Mike Rivero.
[00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:50.102]  Mike, good to have you here with us.
[00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:52.023]  Thank you for having me on the show today.
[00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.567]  There is so much going on.
[00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:57.809]  I just threw out a few of the issues and topics I want to get your take on.
[00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:59.910]  What do you think is most important?
[00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.953]  You've got missile cruisers and weapons being moved in, openly talking about hitting Iran.
[00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:06.654]  What do you think is most important right now?
[00:02:07.372 --> 00:02:11.614]  Well, I think we're definitely seeing a renewed push for a new war in Iran.
[00:02:12.814 --> 00:02:23.858]  And it seems like the government of the United States, either goaded by Israel or simply because they can't think of anything else to do, they're going to try and get out of the mess they're in by starting a war and hoping that the American people
[00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.341]  Well, simply follow the flag off the edge of the cliff with the government.
[00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:37.329]  Unfortunately, we have a lot of history in this nation where the government repeatedly gets itself into some extreme financial situations, then sees war as their best way out.
[00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.851]  And it has worked in the past with World War I and World War II.
[00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:43.974]  I don't see it working now, but I think the U.S.
[00:02:43.994 --> 00:02:47.777]  government has basically run out of any other ideas that they can try right now.
[00:02:48.077 --> 00:02:49.278]  They're broke, they're in debt.
[00:02:49.578 --> 00:02:53.782]  Even if they nationalized every private asset of every American citizen,
[00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:57.365]  That would only cover about one quarter of the hole they've dug themselves into.
[00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:08.857]  And meanwhile, their health care plan's failing, their swine flu hoax is failing, their global carbon tax is failing, but they're not stopping.
[00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:12.021]  Obama just says, I'm going to use executive orders and do it regardless.
[00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:21.324]  Yeah, and that's a very, very dangerous situation because he's making it clear that the government has broken away from the will of the people, or even the best interests of the people.
[00:03:21.964 --> 00:03:38.355]  And I was talking with somebody earlier today that it looks like they're going to go ahead with the attack on Iran and they no longer care if we know it's legit or not, even as we're finding the British Parliament is agreeing that yes, there was no legal basis for the attack on Iraq,
[00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:41.497]  Blair is already out there saying we've got to go into Iran.
[00:03:41.817 --> 00:03:51.823]  The problem with that approach is that if you go back to your Art of War by Sun Tzu, victory always goes to the army that believes they have the moral right on their side.
[00:03:52.183 --> 00:04:07.172]  And if the United States starts yet another war with an army that knows they're the bad guys, that they're the invaders and conquerors, and they're not fighting for anything that is morally right, they're going in with a tremendous disadvantage that our wonder weapons is not going to be able to overcome.
[00:04:07.742 --> 00:04:10.643]  Well, that brings me to the next point when we come back in the long segment.
[00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:14.184]  Clearly, the underwear bomber was a staged event.
[00:04:14.244 --> 00:04:22.907]  It's now admitted in mainstream news, but buried in the articles, that okay, the State Department ordered them to let him on the plane and he didn't have a passport, but we helped him.
[00:04:23.447 --> 00:04:26.168]  Obviously, meaning the smart-dressed man was a government agent.
[00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:31.350]  Who else can get somebody on board a plane and pass the security checkpoints and the naked body scanners?
[00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.471]  And this is clearly a kickoff for the new police state.
[00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.872]  We're seeing all these new fake Bin Laden tapes.
[00:04:37.532 --> 00:04:44.677]  They're going to need to stage a new terror attack, a new 9-11, to go into Iran, I believe, or politically worldwide.
[00:04:44.697 --> 00:04:48.820]  It would be too damaging for even the arrogant, hubris-filled globalists.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.282]  So I want to get your take on that, Mike Rivero, on the other side.
[00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:55.024]  Then we'll get into the economy, internet censorship.
[00:04:55.524 --> 00:05:00.248]  The global tyranny takeover is moving into a high-gear phase.
[00:05:02.864 --> 00:05:06.485]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:06.825 --> 00:05:14.947]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:15.687 --> 00:05:19.728]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:20.308 --> 00:05:31.130]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:40.753]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:46.315]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:46.695 --> 00:05:53.878]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:54.178 --> 00:05:56.939]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:02.037 --> 00:06:05.681]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:09.045]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:14.070]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.337]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.497 --> 00:06:22.740]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.540]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.980]  Bernanke?
[00:06:24.061 --> 00:06:24.841]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:26.022]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:28.263]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:49.116]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.437 --> 00:06:58.545]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:05.927]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:07:06.007 --> 00:07:08.729]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:13.212]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:07:14.092 --> 00:07:18.536]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:34.546]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:36.287]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:37.488]  Everybody needs to get it.

[00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:08.459]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.281]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:11.741]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.522 --> 00:08:13.442]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.463 --> 00:08:17.745]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:22.308]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:27.508]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:28.989]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:34.891]  You can always listen to the free podcast if you don't have an AM and FM in your area or shortwave radio or satellite.

[00:09:01.544 --> 00:09:07.768]  Mike Rivero joins us from WhatReallyHappened.com, an excellent alternative news source and aggregator.
[00:09:08.188 --> 00:09:11.230]  I go there every day to make sure I'm not missing anything.
[00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.852]  And again, Mike Rivero joins us for stations that just
[00:09:15.732 --> 00:09:15.932]  That's
[00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:44.415]  There's no way they're going to be able to attack Iran, which they're clearly gearing up to do and moving weapon systems and more ships and missiles in, and new sanctions.
[00:09:44.815 --> 00:09:47.296]  They clearly can't do that without a staged terror attack.
[00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:51.979]  And then we have the underwear bombing situation, where it's now come out that the U.S.
[00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:54.060]  government ordered him to be allowed on the plane.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.203]  That's in the Detroit News, that's in other mainstream newspapers, but buried in the article
[00:10:00.063 --> 00:10:03.624]  Like it's no big deal that, okay, there was a second guy on the plane.
[00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:05.324]  He did supposedly have a bomb.
[00:10:05.344 --> 00:10:08.765]  We did lie about Kurt Haskell and say that he wasn't telling the truth.
[00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:10.086]  Yes, he has other witnesses.
[00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:13.967]  Yes, the State Department ordered him to be allowed on the plane.
[00:10:14.207 --> 00:10:15.967]  Then one of their people let him on the plane.
[00:10:16.327 --> 00:10:18.368]  This is huge information.
[00:10:18.408 --> 00:10:20.749]  So start with the State of the Empire, Mike.
[00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:21.809]  I want your take on this.
[00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.311]  Uh, what the Empire needs.
[00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:33.439]  Do you agree with me that they need a staged terror attack and the underwear bomber was the kickoff, the new fake, which they even admit they can't even prove are real.
[00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:37.563]  Bin Laden tapes coming out, uh, right as the Yemen operation starts.
[00:10:37.643 --> 00:10:39.905]  I mean, this, this, this really looks bad, Mike.
[00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:41.579]  It looks bad.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:52.526]  There's one moment of levity in the whole situation, and that, of course, was the Bin Laden tape in which he's critical of global warming, which I think was pushing a little bit too far to be believable, and a lot of people actually got a chuckle out of that.
[00:10:52.866 --> 00:10:53.807]  But you're absolutely right.
[00:10:53.847 --> 00:10:54.827]  They need a false flag.
[00:10:54.867 --> 00:10:57.829]  They need something that is so big and horrific, it's going to shock
[00:10:58.229 --> 00:11:00.751]  Americans into supporting whatever the government wants to do.
[00:11:01.091 --> 00:11:05.855]  It's gotta be so big that it shocks Americans into unquestioning obedience without even thinking.
[00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:07.576]  The crotch bomber was not it.
[00:11:07.656 --> 00:11:09.197]  They didn't get any traction with it.
[00:11:09.537 --> 00:11:12.099]  Symbolic gestures, almost, maybe.
[00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:13.080]  That's not gonna work.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.763]  They need something really horrifically big, and there are two targets of opportunity coming up in the next couple of weeks.
[00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:28.569]  The first, of course, is the Olympics up in Canada, and we already know there's something like two tons of explosive that went missing from a company that is partly owned by the Carlyle Group.
[00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:36.874]  Now the company's trying to say that, oh, the explosives aren't missing, it was just a clerical error, but the police are saying they can't validate that the explosives have been accounted for.
[00:11:37.254 --> 00:11:40.496]  So that situation is in play, and of course we have the Super Bowl coming up.
[00:11:40.996 --> 00:11:47.074]  Kind of like those missing cruise missiles with Cheney and then at least 11 members of the base being murdered to cover it up.
[00:11:47.645 --> 00:11:49.225]  Yeah, the missing nuclear weapons.
[00:11:49.286 --> 00:12:05.190]  I mean, the whole credibility of the Iran war is going to be based on proving to America that Iran really did have nuclear weapons after all, not only to recover from the IAEA reports and the National Intelligence Estimate, but also from the lie in Iraq.
[00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:13.633]  And so the possibility of our government or Israel setting off a small nuclear weapon someplace in the United States or Canada cannot be discounted completely.
[00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:17.394]  And I know it sounds fantastical and like it's from a James Bond movie,
[00:12:17.634 --> 00:12:19.276]  But isn't it even bigger than that?
[00:12:19.336 --> 00:12:19.716]  Clearly the U.S.
[00:12:19.736 --> 00:12:21.478]  has been positioned worldwide as the new boogeyman
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:39.760]  Yes.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:49.905]  Rupert Murdoch owned papers worldwide bashes then domestically, you know, he poses as a conservative to control the libertarian movement.
[00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:57.348]  Clearly, America does the dirty work and then we're imploded and we're now beginning to come to that point.
[00:12:58.442 --> 00:12:59.062]  I agree with you.
[00:12:59.463 --> 00:13:05.666]  We're the new Nazi power, and it's amazing how closely our government is following Adolf Hitler's playbook.
[00:13:06.006 --> 00:13:14.691]  Both from the false flag attack in New York, which matches the operation in Gleiwitz, to the selection of an ethnic minority to be used as a scapegoat and a social target.
[00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:20.874]  It's the same propaganda tricks over and over again and it's going to end the same way.
[00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.495]  Look at how Germany ended World War II.
[00:13:23.775 --> 00:13:30.598]  That is the future of America, unless the American people are willing to grab their government by the lapels and say, we're not following you.
[00:13:31.462 --> 00:13:33.843]  Well, that's the good news, and I want you to really walk through this.
[00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:47.668]  I mean, chronicle all the hoaxes, the flu, the WMDs, the banker bailout, just on every front, the carbon tax, the healthcare takeover.
[00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:58.072]  Everything they're doing is failing, and you talk about the government ignoring the people, the executive and the bureaucracy is even ignoring their own Congress.
[00:13:58.152 --> 00:14:00.073]  I mean, this is rogue government.
[00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:15.721]  It absolutely is, and a big part of the problem is that our top leaders are so insulated from the rest of the world by all these yes-men and yes-women that cluster around them, I don't think they understand the extent to which ordinary Americans understand.
[00:14:16.242 --> 00:14:18.683]  We have been lied to on a monumental scale.
[00:14:18.763 --> 00:14:21.205]  Americans are the most lied to people on the face of the earth.
[00:14:21.505 --> 00:14:24.587]  Whether it's Climategate, or the When Pigs Fly flu, or TARP,
[00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:26.989]  And all the rest of that.
[00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:32.452]  We see that it is an unending series of lies going back to Saddam's nuclear bombs.
[00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:38.336]  I think our government leaders, Obama and the Warhawks, they're so insulated.
[00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:40.217]  I don't think they understand.
[00:14:41.158 --> 00:14:43.260]  The degree to which their credibility has been destroyed.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.942]  Now, some people obviously do.
[00:14:44.962 --> 00:14:48.345]  You were talking before about this sudden push for internet censorship.
[00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:57.454]  We're hearing the United Nations call for web operators to be licensed in order to control who is allowed and not allowed to create a website.
[00:14:57.714 --> 00:15:05.061]  This, I think, is a knee-jerk reaction to the fact that it was the blogosphere and it was the alternative media that brought down the whole Climategate hoax.
[00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:15.283]  And absolutely exposed to the world that these kind of large-scale conspiracies between government and academia and corporate media, yeah, they really do exist.
[00:15:15.363 --> 00:15:18.304]  We've got one staked out on the dirt for you to study all you want.
[00:15:18.724 --> 00:15:22.625]  And I think the globalists are having a fear reaction.
[00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:34.487]  They're trying to find some way they can drag us back to the glory days of the 1950s where they just wave Russians at us and pump lies at us through the TV and we had no alternative but to sit there and accept it and believe it.
[00:15:34.847 --> 00:15:41.493]  But it's a completely different environment, and they are failing to evolve to that new environment, which is why I am convinced that the U.S.
[00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:44.195]  government is headed for extinction by its own hands.
[00:15:45.296 --> 00:15:46.717]  But that's the globalist plan.
[00:15:46.757 --> 00:15:49.419]  The big banks sit offshore, they use the U.S.
[00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:54.043]  to carry this out, they get us deep in debt, then they scapegoat us for everything in the end.
[00:15:55.327 --> 00:15:58.970]  Well, I don't think we're talking about exactly the same mechanism.
[00:15:59.411 --> 00:16:00.292]  I think the U.S.
[00:16:00.372 --> 00:16:03.314]  might implode before those plans can even come to fruition.
[00:16:04.015 --> 00:16:05.737]  But the bottom line is, when the U.S.
[00:16:05.837 --> 00:16:13.564]  goes down, I think it's probably going to take a big chunk of the globalism with it, because so many of the globalists were using the U.S.
[00:16:13.624 --> 00:16:17.868]  as a foundation at least to launch the swine flu pandemic hoax.
[00:16:19.089 --> 00:16:28.934]  And the economic hoax you were talking about, the banks are calling for a new global financial authority, which we knew was going to be the third pillar for the foundation of global government.
[00:16:29.214 --> 00:16:31.756]  But all three pillars are in serious, serious trouble.
[00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:43.242]  And I think that if the United States government and economy implodes, that third pillar is going to get dragged down with it, and the globalists are going to have nothing that they can use to trick the people into going along with the global government.
[00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:59.016]  They can sit up there and say, we're the global government, but if 5 billion human beings, 6 billion human beings, sit there and say, I'm not going along with it, they do not have the military force to literally conquer the entire planet and rule it from a single golden pyramid somewhere.
[00:16:59.677 --> 00:17:09.285]  Well, I agree with you, and almost all the economists and historians we have on say that the New World Order has overplayed their hand, that everything is starting to really crumble for them.
[00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:16.278]  And that when the dollar goes, it's going to suck all the other major currencies right along with it.
[00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:25.449]  And then when the banks try to finagle a whole new plan to give them even more power out of the crisis they created, that they're just going to get arrested.
[00:17:25.729 --> 00:17:32.471]  Because we've done our job in the previous decades of identifying them and breaking down the global government and breaking down who they are.
[00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:36.733]  They tried to just black ball us and ignore us and call us conspiracy terrorists.
[00:17:36.993 --> 00:17:42.255]  But now that everything we said came true, the public's taking it like some form of revelation.
[00:17:42.655 --> 00:17:44.355]  It's not some form of revelation.
[00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:49.437]  We're not staring into a reflecting pool or looking into a misty, you know, crystal ball.
[00:17:49.757 --> 00:17:51.738]  We read what they said they would do.
[00:17:52.098 --> 00:17:54.119]  We went out not caring if we got attacked.
[00:17:54.659 --> 00:18:03.948]  To tell the truth, and it's literally the equivalent of billions of time bombs in people's brains that as things get worse, they remember everything we told them.
[00:18:04.557 --> 00:18:05.618]  That's exactly right.
[00:18:05.658 --> 00:18:11.120]  I'm flooded with emails saying, I thought you were a loon five years ago, but obviously you're correct.
[00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:14.282]  Everything that you predicted and warned about was coming about.
[00:18:14.742 --> 00:18:29.330]  Right now, the climate gate pillar and the swine flu pillar are in absolute ruins, and this financial push, this quest to create a global reserve bank is falling apart, because most of the world sees economic globalism as the reason
[00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.510]  That a U.S.
[00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.212]  downturn turned into a global calamity.
[00:18:33.432 --> 00:18:38.514]  They're not going to see globalism as a solution to problems created by globalism.
[00:18:38.574 --> 00:18:44.437]  It's like taking the Titanic, backing up and whacking the iceberg on the other side just to see if maybe that fixes the leak.
[00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:47.639]  Most people understand that really isn't going to work.
[00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:56.423]  I think most people are beginning to see the idea of a single global government as a problem and they see the return to small regional communities
[00:18:56.983 --> 00:18:59.884]  Thousands of them across the face of the earth as the answer.
[00:18:59.904 --> 00:19:00.905]  All right, let's go back.
[00:19:02.425 --> 00:19:03.886]  The arrogance of these people.
[00:19:03.946 --> 00:19:07.608]  We get the Copenhagen Treaty two days into the two-week conference.
[00:19:07.968 --> 00:19:09.469]  It's worse than we even thought.
[00:19:09.829 --> 00:19:11.470]  Literally hundreds of new taxes.
[00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.771]  Right at double the carbon cuts for the third world.
[00:19:15.832 --> 00:19:19.233]  They lied to the third world and said, look, I know you don't like the IMF and World Bank.
[00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:20.694]  You know we robbed you.
[00:19:21.514 --> 00:19:27.036]  We promised we're gonna give you a bunch of free money from the evil Americans and Europeans and British and Australians.
[00:19:27.077 --> 00:19:32.499]  Then they read the treaty and it rapes the West, but also rapes them even worse.
[00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:37.341]  I mean, how did the bankers think they could... I mean, it's just... Stay there, Mike.
[00:19:37.361 --> 00:19:37.941]  We're gonna come back.
[00:19:37.961 --> 00:19:39.882]  We're also gonna be taking phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:39.902 --> 00:19:39.962]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:39.982 --> 00:19:40.242]  But listen.
[00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:48.289]  When I go to your calls, just throw your question out quick.
[00:19:48.329 --> 00:19:49.171]  I'm going to the next person.
[00:19:49.491 --> 00:19:49.992]  Fair warning.
[00:19:50.032 --> 00:19:54.441]  I want to hear from you, but at the same time, I want to be able to get to a lot of your calls.
[00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:58.088]  Mike Rivera, right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:58.108 --> 00:19:58.509]  Stay with us.

[00:21:09.346 --> 00:21:13.829]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:21:14.716 --> 00:21:19.179]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:22:01.596 --> 00:22:02.417]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:02.617 --> 00:22:07.961]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:08.581]  I get it.
[00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:18.028]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:19.489]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:19.709 --> 00:22:27.915]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:28.175 --> 00:22:31.457]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:31.578 --> 00:22:35.660]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:35.841 --> 00:22:37.422]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:37.462 --> 00:22:40.664]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:40.844 --> 00:22:45.027]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:45.227 --> 00:22:45.928]  You should, too.
[00:22:46.128 --> 00:22:47.108]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:50.531]  Call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:51.151 --> 00:22:51.371]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.391 --> 00:22:52.912]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:58.593]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.694 --> 00:23:04.455]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?
[00:23:04.896 --> 00:23:05.816]  Have you been laid off?
[00:23:06.216 --> 00:23:07.236]  Or had your hours cut?
[00:23:07.977 --> 00:23:09.297]  Are balloon payments coming due?
[00:23:10.194 --> 00:23:13.437]  You need help from MortgageFraudExaminers.com.
[00:23:14.038 --> 00:23:20.044]  To stop the housing crisis, Congress and the White House are pinning their hopes on homeowners renegotiating their mortgages.
[00:23:20.464 --> 00:23:24.168]  The trouble is, the banks are saying no 80% of the time.
[00:23:24.628 --> 00:23:29.092]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can help you get the leverage you need to turn things around.
[00:23:32.796 --> 00:23:33.697]  I think so.
[00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:32.952]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls, but then I want to go to Mike Rivero and talk about the fact that it doesn't matter if the Congress has said no.
[00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:36.153]  It doesn't matter if the cap-and-trade bill is dead.
[00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:41.754]  The city where I live, they've announced $2.6 billion within the first three years of this.
[00:24:42.254 --> 00:24:45.395]  Starting next year, they're trying to pass it later this month or early in March.
[00:24:46.525 --> 00:24:48.347]  And the federal government and U.N.
[00:24:48.507 --> 00:24:49.227]  openly run it.
[00:24:49.347 --> 00:24:53.851]  Home inspections, taxes on everything, doubling on your energy prices.
[00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:58.754]  I mean, just raping the likes of which the world has never seen.
[00:24:58.774 --> 00:25:00.476]  We're going to be talking about that with Mike Rivero.
[00:25:00.736 --> 00:25:02.497]  But let's go to John in New York first.
[00:25:02.577 --> 00:25:03.418]  John, you're on the air.
[00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:03.858]  Go ahead.
[00:25:04.879 --> 00:25:05.760]  Hey, Alex.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.783]  I just want to say I completely agree with everything that Mike had said there, especially
[00:25:12.325 --> 00:25:21.256]  I was going down the same road as Nazi Germany because I think Hitler was basically an evil Pinocchio controlled by Rockefeller and Rothschild.
[00:25:22.503 --> 00:25:24.986]  And Bush's great-grandfather Prescott.
[00:25:25.026 --> 00:25:30.031]  Well, actually, you know, we used to cover that when it was in the London Guardian and BBC and people wouldn't believe us.
[00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:33.475]  But now, I mean, even Oliver Stone's making a film about it.
[00:25:33.895 --> 00:25:36.799]  But he doesn't tell you the Communists were also funded by this.
[00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:44.307]  But if you read Carol Quigley's book, who was allowed into the annals of the New World Order, this was the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor, he explains
[00:25:44.787 --> 00:25:55.372]  The public wants choices, so we give them fascism or communism, and the different variants of those, when it's all black uniforms, secret police, high taxes, ultra-elites.
[00:25:55.452 --> 00:25:56.112]  Mike Rivera.
[00:25:58.293 --> 00:26:13.841]  Choices were being given, whether it's fascism versus communism, or Republican versus Democrat, it's all an illusion designed to sell us the same agenda, which is complete control of our lives, the looting of the population, the suborning of individuals to the will of the state,
[00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:15.262]  Anything else, John?
[00:26:37.421 --> 00:26:38.422]  Well, yeah, I agree.
[00:26:38.442 --> 00:26:39.903]  You know, I totally agree with that.
[00:26:40.083 --> 00:26:41.504]  And I think that the time is now.
[00:26:42.005 --> 00:26:44.927]  I mean, I hear you say, Alex, you know, about the next election and this and that.
[00:26:45.507 --> 00:26:48.870]  And honestly, we don't have much control in the election anyway.
[00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.012]  If we do happen to get somebody in there that's good, they'll just take him out anyway.
[00:26:52.052 --> 00:26:53.253]  We've seen that done with Kennedy.
[00:26:53.313 --> 00:26:56.496]  I mean, there's no way of stopping him.
[00:26:57.056 --> 00:26:58.317]  None of it's at the state level.
[00:26:58.717 --> 00:26:59.798]  None of it's an idea.
[00:26:59.998 --> 00:27:03.281]  Ideas are bulletproof, as V for Vendetta says so well.
[00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:03.942]  They're eternal.
[00:27:04.902 --> 00:27:11.345]  And so, if you simply continue to tell the truth, sunshine is what beats these people.
[00:27:11.445 --> 00:27:15.267]  Banner hangs, websites, radio shows, information.
[00:27:15.547 --> 00:27:20.030]  We're telling the truth, and if we just set the truth up against the lie, we're going to win every time.
[00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.550]  Mike Rivera.
[00:27:21.209 --> 00:27:22.310]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:27.255]  We're beginning to see the states starting to pull away from the federal government.
[00:27:27.495 --> 00:27:30.078]  We're seeing the emergence of more and more secession movements.
[00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:33.882]  We're seeing people talk about breaking off and forming their own country.
[00:27:34.282 --> 00:27:36.024]  And I think that's a good direction to go.
[00:27:36.725 --> 00:27:41.489]  I think at this point, hardly anybody sees a reason to continue with the federal government.
[00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:42.670]  They're taking all of our money.
[00:27:42.951 --> 00:27:43.972]  They're giving nothing back.
[00:27:44.672 --> 00:27:47.373]  Obama's new budget puts us on a wartime footing.
[00:27:47.653 --> 00:27:58.096]  He's freezing domestic spending, which is a polite way of saying, sorry, we gave all your tax money to the banks, we've got nothing left over to spend on you, and we need the rest of this pile of money to buy bombs and stuff.
[00:27:58.516 --> 00:28:01.116]  And so everybody out in America is saying, well, why do I need this?
[00:28:01.236 --> 00:28:04.097]  Why do I need to spend the rest of my life... Well, let me say this about secession.
[00:28:04.277 --> 00:28:07.318]  I am for Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment declarations.
[00:28:07.718 --> 00:28:09.759]  The states form the federal government.
[00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:10.939]  They are the boss.
[00:28:11.979 --> 00:28:18.781]  The Globalist and some of their game plans do plan to break off the Southwest into an enclave as part of the North American Union.
[00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:19.902]  That's in their own documents.
[00:28:19.982 --> 00:28:22.843]  It's on record from the SPP and CFR.
[00:28:22.963 --> 00:28:33.386]  But, at the same time, if your country's been conquered by offshore financial interest, the only way to get it back is to have people remove themselves and then reconstitute it.
[00:28:35.456 --> 00:28:43.803]  Absolutely, and we need to basically get back to the Constitution as it originally was, which includes no private central bank.
[00:28:43.943 --> 00:28:49.668]  In 1913 is when the conquest of America truly began, and it's been proceeding very, very slowly.
[00:28:50.069 --> 00:28:50.869]  Now we're in a race.
[00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:54.773]  They're trying to complete their designs before the rest of America wakes up to what's going on.
[00:28:55.632 --> 00:28:56.993]  Yeah, I mean, they captured the U.S.
[00:28:57.033 --> 00:29:15.005]  a long time ago as an engine of tyranny, but now they're really trying to further exploit us and bring us into a high-tech form of enslavement and to try to use up the rest of our energy and our sustenance, our substance, in their overall conquest.
[00:29:15.065 --> 00:29:21.169]  And it just isn't going well for them, which I'm glad about, but also it's kind of scary that
[00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:24.290]  Everything they're doing is falling apart, but they don't care.
[00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.630]  They just roll forward, Mike.
[00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.531]  They're addicted to our money.
[00:29:27.711 --> 00:29:28.431]  That's the problem.
[00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:29.411]  We need an intervention.
[00:29:31.252 --> 00:29:35.253]  I mean, it's like an employee, or a boss, or an alcoholic husband or wife.
[00:29:35.293 --> 00:29:37.074]  Somebody who you just... who won't stop.
[00:29:37.114 --> 00:29:39.334]  And you're so amazed by what they do.
[00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:45.616]  But this alcoholic husband or wife has men in black uniforms with machine guns that work for him.
[00:29:45.876 --> 00:29:47.577]  They're ready to kill whoever they're told to.
[00:29:47.897 --> 00:29:48.537]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.627 --> 00:29:54.631]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.572 --> 00:29:58.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.961]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.301 --> 00:30:09.262]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.623 --> 00:30:11.363]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.683 --> 00:30:16.485]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.685 --> 00:30:17.645]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.865 --> 00:30:18.605]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.985 --> 00:30:20.586]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.866 --> 00:30:21.686]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.946 --> 00:30:24.007]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:24.147 --> 00:30:25.247]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.487 --> 00:30:26.788]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:27.108 --> 00:30:32.072]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.273 --> 00:30:35.476]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.856 --> 00:30:39.359]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:40.680]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.521]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.821 --> 00:30:42.722]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.922 --> 00:30:43.643]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.663 --> 00:30:44.664]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.924 --> 00:30:47.687]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:51.630]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:00.595 --> 00:31:01.575]  What's your home worth?
[00:31:01.756 --> 00:31:03.676]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:31:03.856 --> 00:31:06.598]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:14.421]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:31:59.994 --> 00:32:03.976]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:32:04.096 --> 00:32:06.857]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:32:06.957 --> 00:32:08.197]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:32:08.237 --> 00:32:08.938]  It's very real.
[00:32:09.058 --> 00:32:11.179]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:12.819]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:32:53.154 --> 00:32:53.835]  You look like an angel.

[00:33:22.122 --> 00:33:24.906]  Oh, yes they are!
[00:33:25.608 --> 00:33:32.960]  The thing is though, the more they fool people, the shorter their scams will work.
[00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:35.255]  And that's the good news.
[00:33:35.275 --> 00:33:39.419]  We're going to Julio, Jeff, Michael, Tito, and many others.
[00:33:39.459 --> 00:33:43.203]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:33:44.265 --> 00:33:52.033]  Look, we've added a new t-shirt every week the last few months, and I haven't even plugged the actual new t-shirts.
[00:33:52.113 --> 00:33:55.397]  These are the newest that just came in yesterday.
[00:33:57.905 --> 00:34:01.708]  And my favorite is this one of the new ones.
[00:34:02.449 --> 00:34:10.095]  It says, Defend Freedom, and it's got an image of a horse with a Minuteman with a bullhorn, and it says InfoWars.com under it.
[00:34:10.876 --> 00:34:16.640]  Looks like a football or swim team or basketball team workout jersey.
[00:34:17.401 --> 00:34:20.223]  We've got that, and there's nothing on the back of this one.
[00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:23.362]  Just the classic high school style.
[00:34:24.243 --> 00:34:28.925]  And then we've got this shirt with a similar Minuteman on the front.
[00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:33.188]  It says, Defend Freedom, Join the Resistance, Infowars.com.
[00:34:33.628 --> 00:34:38.251]  And on the back it says, Infowars.com, Join the Resistance.
[00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:42.933]  Great way to meet like-minded people out there.
[00:34:43.053 --> 00:34:45.155]  And we've got, I don't know how many t-shirts now.
[00:34:45.215 --> 00:34:48.817]  It's got to be approaching a hundred different designs, ball caps.
[00:34:49.918 --> 00:34:55.468]  We've got the, what do you call the beanies for like cold weather like Jaren's wearing right now that you pull down over your head?
[00:34:58.593 --> 00:34:59.315]  What do you call those?
[00:34:59.335 --> 00:35:00.837]  What do you call those kind of hats?
[00:35:02.907 --> 00:35:03.748]  Watchman cap.
[00:35:04.148 --> 00:35:07.091]  We've got those with the Tyranny Response Team at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:07.411 --> 00:35:10.434]  And yes, all of your purchases make this radio show possible.
[00:35:10.494 --> 00:35:15.478]  We're not like the Defense Department that takes your tax money and then uses it in propaganda against you.
[00:35:15.819 --> 00:35:24.747]  We're here being funded by your support, so be sure and visit the online video bookstore slash apparel store at InfoWars.com today.
[00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:33.739]  Okay, Mike Rivero again is our guest right now, and I want to go over some Twitter questions for you, Mike, briefly, and then I'm going to go back to the calls.
[00:35:34.879 --> 00:35:40.360]  It says, hey Alex, my question, this is from our new Twitter account, twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.201]  You can sign up there, folks.
[00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:48.382]  It says, hey Alex, my question is, do you think our military will stay in Haiti to take over the country?
[00:35:48.482 --> 00:35:52.623]  And my answer, that's a question to me, but I'll also ask it to Mike, is that
[00:35:54.024 --> 00:35:56.865]  The globalists have controlled Haiti for more than 50 years.
[00:35:56.885 --> 00:35:59.106]  Well, we had troops going there, what, 100 years ago?
[00:35:59.686 --> 00:35:59.906]  Was it 1903?
[00:36:00.026 --> 00:36:00.766]  And then 1908?
[00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:03.307]  And there's been so many invasions.
[00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:06.948]  That country's already run by the West.
[00:36:07.628 --> 00:36:09.848]  But certainly, George Bush Sr.
[00:36:09.908 --> 00:36:17.691]  and Clinton and George W. Bush, they've been caught promoting charities that keep most of the money for themselves.
[00:36:17.991 --> 00:36:19.171]  Mike, what's your take on Haiti?
[00:36:19.983 --> 00:36:20.744]  Well, definitely.
[00:36:20.804 --> 00:36:35.233]  Haiti is a source of rich mineral wealth, and my opinion is the United States government, rather than risk the return of Aristide, had a plan already in place to go into Haiti after the next natural disaster, like a hurricane.
[00:36:35.313 --> 00:36:35.973]  We know they did!
[00:36:36.073 --> 00:36:38.875]  I mean, that came out the day before they had a hurricane takeover drill.
[00:36:39.816 --> 00:36:41.057]  And yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:41.097 --> 00:36:44.199]  So when the quake happened, they just basically implemented the plan.
[00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:44.900]  They went in there.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:49.824]  I mean, we were, our troops were in Haiti in 2004 shooting the Haitian people.
[00:36:50.144 --> 00:36:54.547]  And so it's hardly surprising that the Haitians have been very uncomfortable with the return of the Americans.
[00:36:54.887 --> 00:36:57.970]  But it's very clear, I mean, for every dollar that the U.S.
[00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.753]  government claims they're spending on Haitian relief, only one penny actually gets to the Haitian people.
[00:37:02.973 --> 00:37:05.235]  The rest is going for all this military buildup.
[00:37:05.755 --> 00:37:09.640]  Mike, what do you think the timeline, another question of the internet censorship is?
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.783]  Greetings from the Netherlands.
[00:37:24.071 --> 00:37:33.379]  I think that the United Nations in the United States and certainly Israel are trying to figure out some way they can sell the necessity of internet censorship to the world.
[00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:39.483]  They want to keep that part of the internet that allows for government propaganda and the megaphonies to do what they're doing.
[00:37:39.904 --> 00:37:42.326]  Obviously a lot of commerce currently depends on the internet.
[00:37:42.346 --> 00:37:43.146]  Yeah, that's what the UN says.
[00:37:43.447 --> 00:37:46.309]  They're going to allow who they want to be on the web and shut everybody else off.
[00:37:46.329 --> 00:37:47.510]  They're actually now saying it.
[00:37:48.737 --> 00:37:52.960]  Yeah, absolutely, and it's a reaction to the fact that we defeated them at Copenhagen.
[00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:58.405]  And the swine flu, the internet exposed that, now there's criminal investigations.
[00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:05.250]  And so basically what they're finally waking up to is what you and I have known for the last 12, 14, 15 years.
[00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:17.901]  The government of the nation, the government of the world, as it sees itself, has lost the ability to successfully lie to the population and to be believed.
[00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:21.845]  And they were full of hubris before, Mike, they were full of hubris before.
[00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:27.350]  We've always warned about the point when they finally figure out they're in trouble, that's when they're dangerous.
[00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.531]  Yeah, and we've reached that point.
[00:38:29.871 --> 00:38:39.314]  And all of this talk about internet censorship coming up now is a knee-jerk response to the fact that they didn't get their way at Copenhagen.
[00:38:39.354 --> 00:38:40.775]  Governments around the world, the U.S.
[00:38:40.815 --> 00:38:44.116]  government, the reason Obama is doing all this executive order stuff,
[00:38:44.836 --> 00:38:45.396]  The U.S.
[00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:54.542]  government actually counted on getting these carbon taxes to refill their coffers, and they didn't get it from Copenhagen, and that's when all of a sudden they started talking about executive orders.
[00:38:54.822 --> 00:38:57.684]  And now Iceland's saying no to pay the bankers that robbed them.
[00:38:57.724 --> 00:38:59.725]  I mean, people are really waking up.
[00:39:00.405 --> 00:39:03.227]  Yeah, and what they're waking up to is a very simple concept.
[00:39:04.304 --> 00:39:06.687]  You know, we don't really have money in this country anymore.
[00:39:06.787 --> 00:39:17.818]  It's just pretty pieces of printed paper, and as long as we believe that that has worth, then we're basically going to fall into the trap that they've set for us, you know, with this legalized counterfeiting ring.
[00:39:18.178 --> 00:39:25.326]  Now China is complaining that the gold bars coming out of Fort Knox are as fake as our quarters and dimes in our Federal Reserve notes.
[00:39:25.666 --> 00:39:28.689]  So this is a scandal that is really beginning to catch on.
[00:39:28.769 --> 00:39:32.232]  People are realizing there isn't really any money coming from the government.
[00:39:32.512 --> 00:39:37.316]  It's all this fake paper that we're supposed to believe has power over our lives.
[00:39:37.737 --> 00:39:40.139]  And they're beginning to say, you know, I don't need this.
[00:39:40.279 --> 00:39:41.960]  I reject these Federal Reserve notes.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.702]  I'm going to just do business with my neighbors.
[00:39:44.182 --> 00:40:00.229]  For whatever we have that we agree is mutually valuable and I think it really worth we're thinking about getting back to the constitutional definition of money where the money has intrinsic value so that you can depend on it and it cannot be manipulated by the government.
[00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:07.136]  And so yeah, I think we're seeing a whole rejection of global banking, global reserve, the reserve banking system itself.
[00:40:07.416 --> 00:40:16.686]  People are waking up to the fact that by design, a reserve banking system means that more money is owed to the private bankers than is ever actually in existence.
[00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:17.687]  And it's made up money.
[00:40:17.868 --> 00:40:18.889]  Shifting gears again.
[00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:23.450]  Suddenly Michael Savage is coming out and saying Obama may stage terror attacks.
[00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:28.331]  Bloomberg, maybe a secret banking cabal does run the world after all.
[00:40:28.351 --> 00:40:32.112]  I mean, we are seeing just so much of this admitted.
[00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:36.733]  Perhaps the collapse of the globalists is even worse than we even realize.
[00:40:37.573 --> 00:40:40.014]  And perhaps the biggest stumbling block to this
[00:40:40.974 --> 00:40:49.239]  Is that the Christian Church, and I'm Christian, has accepted and bought into the fact that evil is a foregone conclusion.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.621]  They thought Hitler was the Antichrist.
[00:40:51.661 --> 00:40:53.182]  They thought Stalin was the Antichrist.
[00:40:53.222 --> 00:40:55.443]  They thought Pol Pot was the Antichrist.
[00:40:55.503 --> 00:40:59.246]  The Tutsis being killed by the Hutus in Rwanda thought it was the end of the world.
[00:40:59.746 --> 00:41:02.228]  And that foregone conclusion idea
[00:41:02.668 --> 00:41:06.170]  That we're just supposed to give in to the naked body scanners and give in to the corruption?
[00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:15.295]  I mean, even if you believe that the Antichrist is coming and all this is true, what about Nineveh and the hundred-year reprieve and Jonah?
[00:41:15.575 --> 00:41:27.302]  I mean, we have a responsibility to fight evil, and we're routing these people, but still most of the general public says, I'm Christian, it's the end of the world, and I'm going to sit here on my fat butt.
[00:41:28.382 --> 00:41:47.207]  Yeah, that is definitely an aspect of our society that has been successfully exploited, not only by our own government, but even by Israel, which is trying to convince American Christians that if they help Israel start World War III in the Middle East, that after it's all over, Jesus is going to come down and invite everybody up to the big house.
[00:41:47.827 --> 00:41:50.468]  And even Sarah Palin, the particular church she goes to,
[00:41:50.968 --> 00:41:52.529]  We gotta keep her away from the nukes!
[00:42:08.917 --> 00:42:22.670]  Yeah, we absolutely do, and the fact that they're saying she's the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in 2012, I think is very worrying, because Obama might actually be a one-term president, and things would definitely get worse with Caribou Barbee in the White House.
[00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.451]  Well, we see them setting her up.
[00:42:26.914 --> 00:42:28.456]  First, they built her up, destroyed her.
[00:42:28.596 --> 00:42:35.205]  I believe they're building her up to destroy her so Obama gets back in, and that's why they're selling her to all the tea parties.
[00:42:35.546 --> 00:42:37.689]  We do not want Sarah Palin.
[00:42:37.729 --> 00:42:39.231]  She was McCain's pick.
[00:42:39.632 --> 00:42:40.773]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:42:41.134 --> 00:42:42.536]  What does that tell you about her?
[00:42:43.618 --> 00:42:44.779]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:44.839 --> 00:42:52.406]  She's a manufactured candidate and frankly she does not impress me with her intelligence or her awareness of foreign policy issues.
[00:42:53.006 --> 00:42:54.668]  And it's absolutely a joke.
[00:42:54.828 --> 00:42:57.370]  It really is a joke of the American political system.
[00:42:57.751 --> 00:43:01.414]  But getting back to this issue about our future and fighting evil.
[00:43:01.794 --> 00:43:05.277]  Now obviously you and I have very different belief systems in terms of the universe.
[00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:12.743]  My personal opinion is, heaven and hell is right here on earth, and it's what we choose to make of the world.
[00:43:13.084 --> 00:43:19.929]  And so I'm not going to just sit on my rear and wait for my death to figure out which way I'm going.
[00:43:20.229 --> 00:43:33.440]  If I want a heaven, I have to build it right here on earth, and that is my reason for opposing evil, for opposing nuclear war, for opposing the addiction of greed that infects the ruling classes of the entire planet.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.302]  Everybody talks about globalism.
[00:43:35.582 --> 00:43:44.830]  Maybe we're on the verge of a global revolution where the people of every nation unite together and kick out the oligarchs universally all at the same time.
[00:43:45.051 --> 00:43:46.152]  That would be something to see.
[00:43:47.273 --> 00:43:51.136]  All right, let's go to some phone calls here.
[00:43:51.176 --> 00:43:53.739]  Let's talk to Julio in Illinois.
[00:43:53.779 --> 00:43:54.520]  Julio, go ahead.
[00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:57.425]  Alex Jones, Freedom Fighter, how are you?
[00:43:57.545 --> 00:44:01.653]  Aloha, Mike Rivera from the land of Lincoln here in the mainland.
[00:44:02.234 --> 00:44:07.625]  I mentioned this, Alex, on your show last week, but I couldn't get to the full point of what I was trying to make.
[00:44:08.092 --> 00:44:13.739]  We all know about the bankers, we've all seen Follow the Republic and the Obama deception, knowing the cabinet.
[00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:26.654]  I've been exposing the New World Order to my roommates and now they understand that Turbo Tax Geithner and the Man of the Year Ben Bernanke are the real architects of this global depression going on in this country.
[00:44:27.338 --> 00:44:28.319]  We have three months.
[00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:29.299]  April 15th.
[00:44:29.339 --> 00:44:30.500]  I want to get your thoughts on this.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.261]  It's Tax Day.
[00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:32.101]  It's a Thursday.
[00:44:32.121 --> 00:44:34.023]  A march on Wall Street.
[00:44:34.303 --> 00:44:40.507]  We all protest peacefully, of course, like Gandhi and Martin Luther King have done so well.
[00:44:40.987 --> 00:44:45.190]  And, you know, we expose the bankers to the entire country on Tax Day.
[00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.751]  And, you know, we have speeches.
[00:44:46.791 --> 00:44:49.893]  We have signs, you know, talking about what's really going on.
[00:44:49.993 --> 00:44:52.255]  And we get signed petitions, you know,
[00:44:52.836 --> 00:45:00.664]  Posterize this all over the internet since we don't have much time with net censorship and Yahoo selling off our searches to the government.
[00:45:00.945 --> 00:45:02.126]  What are your guys' thoughts?
[00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:11.114]  Yeah, we need to get the Tea Parties to actually identify the bankers.
[00:45:11.754 --> 00:45:15.877]  Instead, the Tea Parties are all attacking Obama, who is the birdcage liner.
[00:45:15.957 --> 00:45:22.800]  I mean, he's bad, but once he was shot down politically as a messianic savior, he isn't as dangerous now.
[00:45:23.241 --> 00:45:28.204]  The military industrial complex owned by the banks, that's what's dangerous that may stage a terror attack.
[00:45:28.664 --> 00:45:30.505]  But Mike Rivero, comment on what Julio said.
[00:45:31.158 --> 00:45:47.831]  Well basically something that we're talking about over at my radio show on our website is there is a call for a four-day national strike commencing on tax day and going through the weekend and if we were to do that at the same time with the protest I think it's going to carry far more impact than petitions.
[00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:53.315]  In a nation with massive national vote fraud petitions don't carry any impact anymore.
[00:45:53.455 --> 00:45:56.858]  Yeah I agree we need we need to have a strike
[00:45:57.618 --> 00:46:01.843]  Uh, on April 15th to all the new taxes and garbage saying no.
[00:46:02.384 --> 00:46:09.772]  We need people to go into all the cities where they're passing carbon taxes even though it's all been proven to be a fraud and a lie and a robbery by the banks.
[00:46:10.393 --> 00:46:12.055]  And so don't just not go to work.
[00:46:12.455 --> 00:46:12.935]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:46:12.955 --> 00:46:21.400]  I think I've identified one of the enemy's superstar destroyers, and this comes on the heels of your interview with George Hunt about the World Conservation Bank.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:21.500]  Yes.
[00:46:39.758 --> 00:46:43.860]  Yeah, and I actually called Michael Rivera on this on Friday, but I have a follow-up.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:51.665]  This is the Global Environment Facility, and it claims to be the largest funder of projects to improve the global environment.
[00:46:52.285 --> 00:46:58.068]  It's an independent financial organization, and it moves massive amounts of first world dollars.
[00:46:58.429 --> 00:47:02.211]  Yeah, all the big central banks kick into it, and a few other holding companies, yes.
[00:47:02.952 --> 00:47:08.856]  Yeah, well it's got members on its council that are actually sitting members of the Treasury Department.
[00:47:08.876 --> 00:47:14.881]  And I think you need to get somebody like a Paul, Craig Roberts, or... Oh yeah, Paulson gives something like 10% of his money to it.
[00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:18.263]  Well, we need... I think there's a lawsuit here.
[00:47:18.303 --> 00:47:23.207]  You can't have a sitting senior member of the Treasury Department also sitting on the board of a foreign bank.
[00:47:24.548 --> 00:47:25.349]  I agree with you.
[00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:30.032]  I'm aware of what you say, but I've never properly articulated it.
[00:47:30.093 --> 00:47:30.893]  I guess Hunt did.
[00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:39.200]  You need to write an article with the names and the facts and send it to writersandinfowars.com and I am aware of that.
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.582]  We have covered it, but we need it in print.
[00:47:42.162 --> 00:47:43.962]  So, I mean, but this is all illegal.
[00:47:44.022 --> 00:47:53.244]  It's illegal to have Paulson give himself $210 million of the bailout money directly to himself, and Congressman Stern says, how'd you do that?
[00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:55.244]  Who gave you a waiver to do that?
[00:47:55.604 --> 00:47:57.965]  And Paulson says, the Treasury Department gave me a waiver.
[00:47:58.325 --> 00:47:59.325]  He was the head of the Treasury.
[00:48:00.025 --> 00:48:05.606]  That'd be like if I was a bank manager, and I robbed the bank, and I said, but I gave myself a waiver.
[00:48:06.046 --> 00:48:07.447]  I would be thrown into irons.
[00:48:08.727 --> 00:48:09.507]  Anything else, Jeff?
[00:48:10.384 --> 00:48:16.866]  You need to blow this thing wide open, because if you look at their annual report and their stated history, you cannot tell who started this thing.
[00:48:17.826 --> 00:48:19.667]  Well, that's really the World Conservation Bank.
[00:48:19.687 --> 00:48:20.627]  Give people the name again.
[00:48:21.187 --> 00:48:27.189]  Yeah, it's TheGEF.org is the website, and it's the Global Environment Facility.
[00:48:27.629 --> 00:48:27.809]  Yep.
[00:48:28.189 --> 00:48:29.469]  Alright, appreciate your call.
[00:48:29.909 --> 00:48:32.350]  I mean, it's amazing, folks, what's going on.
[00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:37.531]  Again, the Green Tyranny is their way of taking over control of all facets of our lives.
[00:48:37.971 --> 00:48:39.492]  Tito and Canada, you're on the air.
[00:48:40.424 --> 00:48:41.804]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[00:48:42.284 --> 00:48:42.584]  Good.
[00:48:42.885 --> 00:48:44.085]  Thanks for taking my call here.
[00:48:44.165 --> 00:48:48.246]  Just about to head into the Olympics as a helicopter flies overhead.
[00:48:48.646 --> 00:48:50.106]  You know, just keeping everything safe.
[00:48:50.786 --> 00:49:02.629]  Anyways, I haven't heard you talk about the Slovak security mistake earlier in the year, and it was maybe because I missed your show, but I wanted to know if you were aware about it and touched upon it on your show.
[00:49:03.929 --> 00:49:04.829]  Refresh my memory.
[00:49:05.849 --> 00:49:08.510]  Well, earlier in the year, January 6th I believe,
[00:49:09.995 --> 00:49:12.818]  As a security drill in a Slovak airport.
[00:49:13.098 --> 00:49:16.341]  Yeah, they put the bomb in the guy's luggage.
[00:49:17.062 --> 00:49:22.527]  They put the bomb not only in the guy's luggage, and he flew unwittingly to Ireland, to Dublin.
[00:49:23.248 --> 00:49:33.017]  But once they realized that they didn't inform the Irish authorities for three days, and when they did, they initially tried to deny that they had any part of it.
[00:49:34.949 --> 00:49:38.631]  We did cover that at the time, and that looks like a botched false flag.
[00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:39.271]  Mike Ribeiro.
[00:49:39.992 --> 00:49:41.032]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:41.553 --> 00:49:46.576]  You know, every time we see this stuff being planted, what it is is all of this security infrastructure.
[00:49:46.596 --> 00:49:48.597]  We talk about the military-industrial complex.
[00:49:48.857 --> 00:49:57.422]  Well, the complexes are continually changing, and now there's the security-media complex that hypes the terror threat so that the security companies can make money.
[00:49:57.802 --> 00:50:03.626]  But if they don't actually have a security threat every once in a while, people start saying, why are we spending all this
[00:50:03.646 --> 00:50:05.007]  Why are we allowed?
[00:50:25.134 --> 00:50:29.878]  It's well known that big virus, anti-virus companies are funding putting out viruses.
[00:50:30.198 --> 00:50:32.499]  I mean, it's very, very simple.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.462]  It's like the mafia threatening to burn down your grocery store if you don't buy protection from them.
[00:50:38.123 --> 00:50:39.905]  Yeah, it's very, very, very similar.
[00:50:41.423 --> 00:50:43.806]  Alright, appreciate your call, Tito.
[00:50:44.046 --> 00:50:47.190]  Mark, Chris, Eddie, Daniel, Michael, and others.
[00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:49.032]  More with Mike Rivero straight ahead.
[00:50:49.053 --> 00:50:57.583]  And we've got a guest joining us from England, where if you have a learning disability, a mild one, and try to have children, no questions asked, your children are taken by the state.
[00:50:58.444 --> 00:50:59.666]  Like you would take eggs from a hen.
[00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:02.384]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.424 --> 00:51:07.766]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:08.006 --> 00:51:12.627]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:13.027 --> 00:51:18.109]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:23.290]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:51:30.945 --> 00:51:31.845]  And here's the best part.

[00:53:04.573 --> 00:53:06.414]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:53:06.855 --> 00:53:07.275]  Don't!
[00:53:07.736 --> 00:53:10.758]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[00:54:07.316 --> 00:54:14.802]  We've got a member of the British Parliament joining us.
[00:54:16.263 --> 00:54:18.405]  The British government wants to eradicate the family.
[00:54:18.585 --> 00:54:19.887]  That's stated policy.
[00:54:20.628 --> 00:54:22.590]  It's in major textbooks here in the U.S.
[00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:23.831]  and in England and in Europe.
[00:54:24.692 --> 00:54:25.613]  And now they're doing it.
[00:54:26.333 --> 00:54:32.179]  20,000 homes, when a child is born, they say you must have cameras in the house to watch you, to make sure you're not a bad parent.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.403]  Then the government, who abuses children, that's okay.
[00:54:35.543 --> 00:54:36.183]  Leave them alone.
[00:54:36.744 --> 00:54:38.306]  Well, now you have a learning disability.
[00:54:39.482 --> 00:54:40.743]  And you have a child, they take it.
[00:54:41.363 --> 00:54:43.205]  I mean, this is hardcore tyranny.
[00:54:43.605 --> 00:54:46.187]  Again, Hitler was obsessed with taking people's children.
[00:54:46.607 --> 00:54:48.608]  The Soviets were obsessed.
[00:54:49.309 --> 00:55:01.738]  North Korea, we've played documentary clips here, where large portions of the population live in work camps, prison camps, and they put them for five days a year, men and women together, to have a baby, and then it's taken like...
[00:55:02.774 --> 00:55:06.377]  Eggs from a hen, and raised by the state, so there is no family.
[00:55:06.757 --> 00:55:07.938]  I mean, this is really happening.
[00:55:07.978 --> 00:55:09.340]  Mike Rivero, your take on that?
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.141]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:11.301 --> 00:55:17.306]  The government is basically stepping in and treating us like we're a herd of crop animals, if you will.
[00:55:17.727 --> 00:55:26.194]  And as you say, they're breeding us, they're taking the children away because the state is presuming the right to brainwash the children to be servants of the state in the future.
[00:55:26.474 --> 00:55:28.676]  It's exactly what we saw under the Soviet Union.
[00:55:29.176 --> 00:55:32.661]  Nazi Germany, and now they're bringing it to the United States as well.
[00:55:32.982 --> 00:55:35.986]  This is why there's this ongoing campaign against homeschooling.
[00:55:36.246 --> 00:55:41.654]  They don't want the parents to be telling the kids anything that contradicts the will of the state.
[00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:48.934]  On another subject, what do you think of Chavez saying he knows it's an earthquake weapon and the Russians told him so?
[00:55:49.314 --> 00:55:51.055]  We know they have tectonic weapons.
[00:55:51.075 --> 00:55:53.896]  Secretary Cohen of Defense talked about it in the late 90s.
[00:55:54.457 --> 00:55:57.258]  But, I mean, is Chavez going crazy?
[00:55:57.518 --> 00:55:59.119]  How can he just say it with no proof?
[00:55:59.879 --> 00:56:09.264]  My understanding is that that story was debunked as being another hoax along the same lines as when they were claiming Ahmadinejad said he was going to wipe Israel off the map.
[00:56:09.744 --> 00:56:12.086]  That Chavez did not actually say that.
[00:56:12.906 --> 00:56:16.068]  It's just somebody took a guess at it and the story got picked up.
[00:56:16.468 --> 00:56:19.550]  But I believe that Chavez has denied actually saying that now.
[00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:23.352]  It was in one of the big state-run newspapers that we first saw it.
[00:56:24.012 --> 00:56:28.775]  Well, so was the claim that Ahmadinejad was going to wipe Israel off the map.
[00:56:30.199 --> 00:56:34.060]  And what he really said is, we're going to push that government into the sea.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:43.062]  Actually, what Ahmadinejad said is, the government of Israel must vanish from the pages of history, which is not quite the same thing.
[00:56:43.262 --> 00:56:44.282]  Yeah, that's one of the quotes.
[00:56:45.083 --> 00:56:50.204]  I mean, that's like, under the UN agreement, which they're not even signatories to,
[00:56:51.226 --> 00:56:52.326]  But they've been letting the U.N.
[00:56:52.426 --> 00:56:52.546]  in.
[00:56:52.566 --> 00:56:56.807]  They're supposed to tell the world six months before they open a new facility, before enrichment starts.
[00:56:56.867 --> 00:57:02.768]  They do that, and they say, oh my God, we found a secret base, and it was on record that Iran announced it.
[00:57:03.168 --> 00:57:04.448]  I mean, it's just the level.
[00:57:04.888 --> 00:57:07.109]  But I even get fooled by it sometimes, Mike.
[00:57:07.129 --> 00:57:08.969]  Remember back on 888 in 2008?
[00:57:10.289 --> 00:57:20.191]  I get up at 7 in the morning, I turn the news on, the phone's ringing, CNN's got the leader of Georgia on saying, we've been snuck attacked by Russia, help us, we're under attack.
[00:57:22.321 --> 00:57:23.602]  This went on for three hours.
[00:57:23.682 --> 00:57:25.845]  I got in to do the radio show and went, wait a minute.
[00:57:26.445 --> 00:57:29.348]  And people were saying, Alex, no, it is Russia attacking.
[00:57:29.368 --> 00:57:33.012]  And I'm like, wait a minute, even the European news says Georgia attacked them.
[00:57:33.032 --> 00:57:35.895]  I mean, it's just the magnitude of lying.
[00:57:36.275 --> 00:57:37.797]  And then nobody gets in trouble.
[00:57:39.031 --> 00:57:41.294]  Yeah, that's absolutely the case here.
[00:57:41.395 --> 00:57:54.794]  The corporate media just echoes what the government tells them to say, and as that Fox News synthetic bovine growth hormone lawsuit proved, there is no law that requires the corporate media to tell the truth to the American people.
[00:57:55.114 --> 00:57:56.575]  They can lie with impunity.
[00:57:56.915 --> 00:58:01.976]  The corporate leadership can actually fire reporters who refuse to lie, when ordered to do so.
[00:58:02.196 --> 00:58:03.717]  That was the precedent set in this case.
[00:58:04.077 --> 00:58:10.099]  And the bottom line is, they can say whatever they want, and absent of malice, they cannot be sued or punished in any way.
[00:58:10.399 --> 00:58:13.540]  It is legal to lie to the American people, for the media and for politicians.
[00:58:13.941 --> 00:58:20.963]  But, Monsanto was forced to sell that division, and Most Milk doesn't have it in it now, when Most Milk did previously.
[00:58:21.263 --> 00:58:25.484]  The only country in the world to accept it was the U.S., so in the end, the truth did come out.
[00:58:26.144 --> 00:58:31.165]  Yes, it did, as it always does for synthetic hormones, MSG, aspartame.
[00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:39.086]  Because of the Internet, which is why they want to start reining it in and shutting it down, so we've got to stand up and say no, and defeat that takeover as well.
[00:58:39.106 --> 00:58:40.066]  Thank you, Mike Ribeiro.
[00:58:42.827 --> 00:58:44.887]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:54.790]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:55.730]  Number one.
[00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:59.171]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.431 --> 00:58:59.991]  Number two.
[00:59:00.291 --> 00:59:04.853]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.193 --> 00:59:05.633]  It's true.
[00:59:05.933 --> 00:59:10.474]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.794 --> 00:59:11.335]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.615 --> 00:59:14.897]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.198 --> 00:59:18.900]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.121 --> 00:59:19.681]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.921 --> 00:59:22.283]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.683 --> 00:59:26.066]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.366 --> 00:59:26.566]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.147 --> 00:59:31.090]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:36.054]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.354 --> 00:59:40.376]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.516 --> 00:59:42.076]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.296 --> 00:59:44.397]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.557 --> 00:59:47.138]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:47.158 --> 00:59:55.662]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.122 --> 00:59:59.043]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.466 --> 01:00:06.046]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.761 --> 01:00:07.802]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:09.622]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.283 --> 01:00:11.103]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.863 --> 01:00:12.784]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.424 --> 01:00:17.086]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.626 --> 01:00:21.688]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.441 --> 01:00:45.803]  Okay, John Hemming is a member of Parliament in the United Kingdom.
[01:00:46.964 --> 01:00:50.546]  And we saw his name in an article from the Mail Online.
[01:00:50.566 --> 01:00:52.167]  It's been in the other big papers we've seen.
[01:00:52.947 --> 01:00:59.551]  Mother not clever enough to raise child has baby snatched by social workers after running away to Ireland to give birth.
[01:00:59.651 --> 01:01:00.751]  No criminal record.
[01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:01.732]  Hasn't done anything wrong.
[01:01:03.032 --> 01:01:11.966]  Her and her husband are gonna have the baby, and because she had a learning disability in school, and I've seen her on the news, she's well-spoken, they just say you can't have your child.
[01:01:12.948 --> 01:01:16.253]  Like George Orwell said, in the future, there will be no families we will take.
[01:01:16.997 --> 01:01:19.938]  Your children, as if we take the eggs from a hen.
[01:01:20.178 --> 01:01:27.279]  Now, he's got to go away to a vote, so anytime he may leave, and he'll be back in about 10 minutes, he's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:01:27.299 --> 01:01:30.359]  But just like when we have a congressman on, sometimes they've got to run off and vote.
[01:01:30.999 --> 01:01:35.740]  But this is an amazing case, but I look at the video cameras being put in newborns' homes.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.541]  I mean, this is right out of 1984, is it not, sir?
[01:01:39.301 --> 01:01:46.142]  Well, it's more Brave New World rather than 1984, although there's elements of 1984 in the Ministries of Truth, things like that.
[01:01:47.369 --> 01:01:50.972]  Well, we'll break down the basics of what's happening here.
[01:01:51.012 --> 01:02:04.242]  This is a case from Fife, and what it appears to be is that because the mother was herself at some stage in care of the state, they thought, here's a baby we can take and get adopted.
[01:02:05.044 --> 01:02:08.189]  And they thought, well, you know, we've got to stop her getting married.
[01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:13.335]  So we'll prevent her getting married by saying she's too stupid to get married.
[01:02:13.376 --> 01:02:16.700]  And then we'll take her baby at birth.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:21.106]  So they did a runner to Ireland, which is a more pro-family country in practice.
[01:02:21.914 --> 01:02:24.555]  But no doubt they're creeping around thinking of ways to try to get the child back.
[01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:54.358]  Well, there's sort of five people I think would like to do that, but as long as they stay out of Scotland or England, they're reasonably safe.
[01:02:55.279 --> 01:02:57.922]  I've got a number of these cases going on.
[01:02:57.962 --> 01:03:07.072]  I've got a case in Turkey at the moment, a couple in Sweden, one in Spain, one in France, and there's about three or four in Ireland.
[01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:11.903]  And is this people from England fleeing?
[01:03:12.363 --> 01:03:15.364]  Mainly England, although there's this one from Scotland.
[01:03:15.764 --> 01:03:21.386]  Scotland's not as bad as England, because England is completely mad, and Scotland is mad from time to time.
[01:03:23.207 --> 01:03:26.168]  Well, here they take poor people's children.
[01:03:26.188 --> 01:03:27.428]  I've gone and seen it.
[01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:30.489]  They say, well, you're poor, so we're taking your child.
[01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:35.671]  And then they go and sell them for $500,000 on the market through the adoption racket.
[01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:44.415]  I haven't managed to get evidence of people paying the authorities in England for them.
[01:03:44.455 --> 01:03:48.238]  There is a racket where people make a living out of it in that sense.
[01:03:48.638 --> 01:03:52.161]  One of the things always is to follow the money and see where people are making money.
[01:03:52.921 --> 01:03:57.244]  We also see social workers moving into old people's houses they kick out.
[01:03:57.504 --> 01:03:58.665]  We have a lot of that here too.
[01:03:59.886 --> 01:04:03.989]  Well yeah, a lot of it comes down to the accountability processes.
[01:04:04.562 --> 01:04:14.266]  You know, as soon as you start having secret courts where it becomes a criminal offense for people to say how badly they've been treated, all sorts of misbehavior goes on.
[01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:17.987]  Member of Parliament, John Hemming is our guest.
[01:04:18.007 --> 01:04:19.808]  We're going to go to break, sir, and come back to you.
[01:04:20.668 --> 01:04:22.289]  How long will your vote take, do you think?
[01:04:22.809 --> 01:04:25.650]  The vote, when it happens, will take me about three or four minutes.
[01:04:25.711 --> 01:04:29.412]  But the problem is, at the moment, it's all about floods, if you're interested.
[01:04:30.052 --> 01:04:34.254]  At the moment, the minister's on his feet talking about the amendment.
[01:04:34.861 --> 01:04:39.202]  Okay, well we'll just play it by ear and then call you back ten minutes after you have to leave us.
[01:04:39.222 --> 01:04:40.943]  Stay there though, we're coming back from break.
[01:04:40.983 --> 01:04:47.764]  I want you to break down this architecture because the architecture of child snatching in your country is similar to ours.
[01:05:00.967 --> 01:05:03.568]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:08.951]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.312 --> 01:05:11.033]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.353 --> 01:05:16.176]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.356 --> 01:05:17.316]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.536 --> 01:05:18.297]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.677 --> 01:05:20.258]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.558 --> 01:05:21.378]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.619 --> 01:05:23.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:24.920]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.161 --> 01:05:26.501]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.701 --> 01:05:27.702]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:05:27.902 --> 01:05:28.302]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.592 --> 01:05:44.853]  I think.
[01:05:59.992 --> 01:06:06.816]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:06:06.976 --> 01:06:08.918]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:06:09.058 --> 01:06:11.179]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:12.820]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:17.283]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:06:17.423 --> 01:06:19.804]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:06:59.773 --> 01:07:04.016]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.336 --> 01:07:08.419]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.659 --> 01:07:14.082]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.422 --> 01:07:14.883]  It's true.
[01:07:15.163 --> 01:07:19.706]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.026 --> 01:07:20.566]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.847 --> 01:07:24.129]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.429 --> 01:07:28.171]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.352 --> 01:07:28.912]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.152 --> 01:07:31.514]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:35.296]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.596 --> 01:07:35.797]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.377 --> 01:07:40.300]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.283]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:51.527 --> 01:07:53.629]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:07:58.873 --> 01:08:08.159]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.742]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:17.017]  About two years ago, I made the statement that I'd covered textbooks.
[01:08:18.582 --> 01:08:28.426]  Used by social workers here in the US, as well as Europe, that state the family is a disease belonging to a, you know, ancient times.
[01:08:28.466 --> 01:08:30.787]  We must eradicate it for the state to flourish.
[01:08:31.367 --> 01:08:32.708]  We've got to break up the family.
[01:08:32.848 --> 01:08:39.210]  And in England now, people that have children at birth, they have to put a camera in the home, watching them guilty until proven innocent.
[01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:40.471]  Secret courts.
[01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:42.652]  Similar things are being set up here.
[01:08:42.692 --> 01:08:45.053]  But a male story was also in the Telegraph.
[01:08:45.413 --> 01:08:47.534]  Mother not clever enough to raise child.
[01:08:48.354 --> 01:08:52.777]  Has babies snatched by social workers after running away to Ireland to give birth.
[01:08:53.477 --> 01:08:57.040]  And they just said because she had a learning disability, they took the child.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:06.506]  But thank God, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament John Hemming has been championing her and others.
[01:09:06.546 --> 01:09:13.150]  He said there is no evidence that Mark and Carrie cannot be good parents and I just hope that the Irish authorities can resolve this as quickly as possible.
[01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:14.551]  There has been a good break in the case.
[01:09:15.071 --> 01:09:26.877]  But this is still continuing, so get into the secret courts, the architecture sir, how this works and some of the other cases you're facing in England, because I see similar stuff in Australia, US and Canada.
[01:09:27.718 --> 01:09:42.146]  Yeah, the problem we have particularly is to do with the accountability or the quality control on the judgment system used by local authorities, because here it's the
[01:09:42.961 --> 01:09:53.671]  Well, the Children's Services Authority, which is either a county council or a metropolitan unitary authority or district council, which makes these proposals.
[01:09:54.672 --> 01:09:58.336]  They operate through the family court, so the family court is supposed to look at it.
[01:09:58.356 --> 01:10:05.723]  Now, the family court is a court where, if you talk about what's happened in the court, you can go to jail, and they do send people to jail for this.
[01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:14.635]  I am particularly concerned, for instance, that you're only allowed to have one expert.
[01:10:14.695 --> 01:10:16.816]  It's a criminal offence to get a second opinion.
[01:10:17.876 --> 01:10:20.617]  So you can only have the expert agreed by the court.
[01:10:20.657 --> 01:10:22.497]  You can't get somebody else to look at the paper.
[01:10:23.557 --> 01:10:36.160]  And we have situations, for instance, I have one case in Birmingham where an expert was judging whether a mother had the mental capacity to instruct a solicitor.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:47.048]  That is, if you don't have the mental capacity to instruct a solicitor, the official solicitor comes in and what the official solicitor normally does is concede the case against you.
[01:10:47.088 --> 01:10:57.336]  It's like, you know, if you're in a criminal court, you're not allowed to plead not guilty or you're actually, somebody comes in and says you're too stupid to say you're not guilty.
[01:10:57.356 --> 01:10:58.957]  Well, this sounds Kafkaesque.
[01:10:59.017 --> 01:11:03.140]  I mean, this does sound 1984, where it's completely rigged.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.282]  And our family courts are very, very similar.
[01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.403]  It's completely rigged, that's the whole point.
[01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:24.793]  If you take the sum total of all applications for care orders by local authorities on the figures from 2007, if you take the sum total, the application for a care order was only rejected in 0.27% of cases.
[01:11:24.853 --> 01:11:29.516]  Now, that's a slight misrepresentation because sometimes they withdrew the application for
[01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:31.467]  Say that number again.
[01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.848]  I mean, so out of a hundred... 0.27 percent.
[01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:39.789]  So out of a hundred cases... The parents thought they won about a quarter of them.
[01:11:40.449 --> 01:11:46.190]  So 75% of the time... Not 25 out of a hundred, but like out of a thousand winning 27.
[01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.811]  Oh my god, so it's less than 1%?
[01:11:48.951 --> 01:11:49.431]  No, actually 2.7.
[01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.111]  2.7, okay.
[01:11:51.131 --> 01:11:51.911]  Yeah, it's dreadfully bad.
[01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:52.432]  It's less than 1.7.
[01:11:52.472 --> 01:11:53.092]  It's 0.27 percent.
[01:12:01.379 --> 01:12:04.120]  So 90 plus... Three out of a thousand.
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.740]  Three out of a thousand.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:12.761]  So if the government wants your children in England, you have one out of a thousand chance of winning.
[01:12:12.802 --> 01:12:14.322]  I mean, just total kangaroo court.
[01:12:15.202 --> 01:12:18.983]  It is, and a lot of it's to do with the way they control the expert evidence.
[01:12:19.143 --> 01:12:24.644]  If I take the example of losing your child to an IQ test,
[01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:31.603]  There was a lady who didn't speak English, she came from Asia, and they gave her an IQ test through an interpreter.
[01:12:32.783 --> 01:12:35.364]  Now that inherently makes an IQ test invalid.
[01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.964]  You can't do an IQ test through an interpreter.
[01:12:38.304 --> 01:12:41.125]  It makes the outcome invalid, yet they did that.
[01:12:42.685 --> 01:12:44.646]  My God, it's worse than I even thought!
[01:12:45.066 --> 01:12:51.267]  I think it's worse here because we had the adoption... I know you had adoption targets, but here we got the formula wrong as well.
[01:12:52.722 --> 01:12:53.242]  Well, that's right.
[01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:59.644]  Bill Clinton got the law passed where a certain number of children have to be seized every year for the CPS to get their money.
[01:12:59.664 --> 01:13:00.664]  That's right, yeah.
[01:13:00.684 --> 01:13:01.884]  But we have the same thing here.
[01:13:01.924 --> 01:13:03.544]  I got rid of those a few years ago.
[01:13:03.864 --> 01:13:06.825]  We caused a fuss about them, but the system's still going wrong.
[01:13:07.745 --> 01:13:15.107]  And what's interesting is you find that the way that the system has treated the babies taken into care
[01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:22.070]  Causes so much psychological damage that a lot of them attack their adoptive parents at around about age 10.
[01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:27.114]  And then they get to drug them and say their special needs, and then more money.
[01:13:27.134 --> 01:13:30.997]  The whittling thing comes in as well, but very often they just end up going back into care.
[01:13:31.638 --> 01:13:38.143]  But it's actually, there was some work done, some very good work done by a researcher called Professor Michael Rutter.
[01:13:38.643 --> 01:13:44.188]  He looked at the Romanian orphanages, and what he found
[01:13:45.076 --> 01:13:50.879]  And the long-term effect of being in a Romanian orphanage for a baby.
[01:13:50.919 --> 01:13:58.822]  And what he found, which is very interesting, is it didn't really have a long-term effect up to the first six months of life.
[01:13:59.923 --> 01:14:04.785]  And then the next 12 months, between six months and 18 months, was very, very important.
[01:14:06.045 --> 01:14:10.147]  Now, what we do in England, we take a lot of children, a lot of babies away, thousands,
[01:14:11.131 --> 01:14:17.416]  Um, in the first six months, and then they're kept in care for about a year and a half.
[01:14:17.476 --> 01:14:19.137]  And they warehouse them and it screws them up?
[01:14:19.537 --> 01:14:20.618]  And it screws them up, yeah.
[01:14:20.718 --> 01:14:35.389]  And then you have another piece of research in a book called Enhancing Adoptive Parenting, written last year by Alan Rushton and Elizabeth Monk, points out that what they say is, I could read it out if you wanted,
[01:14:35.979 --> 01:14:36.219]  Go ahead.
[01:14:53.701 --> 01:15:21.060]  Um, now, the point about that is what they're saying is that these children who are in adoptive placements, they're placed with adoptive families, um, it all goes very wrong, but it's, the evidence they have is that it's by taking the children into care and by their treatment in care that their behavior gets... Yeah, they're screwed up, not even so much by the adoptive parents, but being warehoused... Oh, not the adoptive parents, no, it's not, because by that time it's too late.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:22.120]  No, exactly.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:32.583]  It's grabbing the baby when it's six months old or a year old, warehousing it for a year, living in basically a cage with a bunch of other kids, punching them in the face.
[01:15:33.043 --> 01:15:37.484]  The point about it is it's not the same as being with your parents, however bad they may be at times.
[01:15:38.764 --> 01:15:41.985]  I am not somebody who believes the state should not intervene, by the way.
[01:15:42.865 --> 01:15:44.587]  Well, let me just expand on this.
[01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:49.733]  My concern is it intervenes inappropriately all the time, and the accountability is not there.
[01:15:50.273 --> 01:15:51.635]  No, no, I understand.
[01:15:51.675 --> 01:15:55.940]  So let me throw this out at you then, because I'm listening to what you're saying, and I've looked at the numbers.
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.282]  I've seen the numbers that the government
[01:15:58.903 --> 01:16:04.626]  In England, a child is seven times more likely to be abused or hurt in government custody.
[01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.947]  Here, it's five times more likely.
[01:16:06.987 --> 01:16:09.688]  Now, you can disagree with that number if you like, but I've seen that in your papers.
[01:16:10.148 --> 01:16:13.950]  I know here, it's been the cover of Time Magazine, you know, the shame of foster care.
[01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:16.651]  The point is, is that let's face the facts.
[01:16:17.171 --> 01:16:26.615]  You get more lazy people, pedophiles, scum, control freaks that want access to kids that get into this business.
[01:16:26.655 --> 01:16:36.258]  Now I'm not saying even a large percentage are, but statistically there are a lot more predators that get into state care because they want access to children.
[01:16:36.318 --> 01:16:43.221]  And we know, we know sir, that it is screwing children up to be in this system.
[01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:50.284]  And obviously you want to take somebody's child if they're beating them with a chain or not feeding them or they're in a crack house.
[01:16:50.604 --> 01:16:51.604]  But I don't see that.
[01:16:51.785 --> 01:16:54.546]  I see them hunting down Christians' children.
[01:16:54.966 --> 01:16:57.687]  I see them taking people's children for no reason.
[01:16:58.348 --> 01:17:00.469]  Well, they take them for an odd reason.
[01:17:01.929 --> 01:17:06.431]  They have a tendency to take children because the mother's a victim of domestic violence.
[01:17:08.462 --> 01:17:16.005]  I find that odd because you would, you know, the evidence of that, one of the cases, Angela Barman's case, very interesting case.
[01:17:16.806 --> 01:17:20.447]  I spoke to her today actually, she's over in Ireland at the moment.
[01:17:21.468 --> 01:17:37.715]  Just to give you a bit of her history, she was the victim, it's been in the papers by the way, she was a victim of domestic violence and she phoned, it could be a lot worse, I'm not going to belittle it, but she phoned the police, got injunctions against her ex.
[01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:45.094]  And the authorities decided to use this to take her then five-year-old son into care.
[01:17:45.114 --> 01:17:45.434]  That's right.
[01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:46.494]  Women aren't told this.
[01:17:46.514 --> 01:17:53.578]  They're told, put an injunction in, even if he's yelling at you, and then they don't know they're coming to snatch your kid.
[01:17:53.618 --> 01:17:59.841]  Yeah, well, they actually use the injunction as the reason that the children were at risk, which is all a bit strange.
[01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:06.945]  But this is why people, why mothers are feeling that not to report domestic violence because
[01:18:08.675 --> 01:18:11.436]  They're worried that their children will be taken if they report domestic violence.
[01:18:11.456 --> 01:18:12.577]  We've got a lot of that in England.
[01:18:13.198 --> 01:18:16.240]  But anyway, I'll give you more of Angela's story because it's quite an interesting one.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.460]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.364]  So she got pregnant and she knew she faced the removal of the baby at birth and probable adoption of the baby.
[01:18:23.404 --> 01:18:26.826]  So she took her son out of foster care and did a runner to Spain.
[01:18:26.846 --> 01:18:31.169]  And she lived and worked in Spain for about a year and they found her in Spain.
[01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:36.513]  And they started proceedings to take her son off her and bring him back to England.
[01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:41.653]  And so she basically got out of Spain and went to Sweden.
[01:18:42.594 --> 01:18:44.375]  To be honest, she found it a bit cold there.
[01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:47.077]  And then she went to Ireland.
[01:18:47.878 --> 01:18:53.942]  But she went to Ireland with a view to standing and fighting the system, rather than giving in.
[01:18:54.082 --> 01:19:02.088]  So her son went to school, she appeared on all the databases, computer systems, so that everyone would know where she was.
[01:19:02.168 --> 01:19:04.390]  And lo and behold, they tried to take her son
[01:19:05.379 --> 01:19:06.340]  From Ireland.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.222]  So she's got two sons with her now.
[01:19:08.622 --> 01:19:11.485]  At that stage, one was seven and one was one and a half.
[01:19:13.086 --> 01:19:24.236]  And they wanted to take the older one and put him in foster care in Devon with a view to getting him adopted because she was once previously a victim of domestic violence from her husband that she hadn't seen for a year.
[01:19:25.054 --> 01:19:35.782]  So let's be clear, because a husband punches you in the nose, you divorce him... I don't think he actually went that far, but... But I mean, not her case, stay there.
[01:19:35.862 --> 01:19:39.945]  I don't think he actually did, but... Okay, I'm not talking about that case.
[01:19:40.205 --> 01:19:46.670]  I'm saying hypothetically, your husband punches you in the nose, but he didn't even do that in this case, I understand.
[01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:51.354]  But your husband punches you, you divorce him, and then they still take your kids,
[01:19:52.074 --> 01:19:53.455]  Even though you're in another country.
[01:19:53.495 --> 01:19:53.895]  She's not.
[01:19:53.915 --> 01:19:55.296]  She's been going around Europe.
[01:19:55.316 --> 01:19:59.378]  She's not been going around... No, I know, but I'm saying they're trying to take the kids, is what I'm saying.
[01:19:59.398 --> 01:19:59.798]  Stay there.
[01:20:00.179 --> 01:20:00.899]  This is just amazing.
[01:20:01.139 --> 01:20:03.060]  Is your computer running slowly?
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.761]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[01:20:05.081 --> 01:20:06.122]  Don't waste your money.
[01:20:06.282 --> 01:20:12.425]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[01:20:12.606 --> 01:20:14.026]  You don't need to buy a new computer.

[01:21:01.683 --> 01:21:05.324]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.685 --> 01:21:08.725]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:08.925 --> 01:21:10.346]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:13.710]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:19.935]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.136 --> 01:21:25.160]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:35.310]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:37.532]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:37.752 --> 01:21:39.093]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:41.615]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:41.816 --> 01:21:43.637]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:43.937 --> 01:21:48.742]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:22:00.825 --> 01:22:01.646]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:01.846 --> 01:22:07.189]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:07.809]  I get it.
[01:22:07.929 --> 01:22:17.294]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:17.554 --> 01:22:18.695]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:18.955 --> 01:22:27.197]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:30.697]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:30.797 --> 01:22:34.898]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:35.078 --> 01:22:36.658]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:36.679 --> 01:22:39.899]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:40.079 --> 01:22:44.240]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.161]  You should, too.
[01:22:45.341 --> 01:22:46.322]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:49.406]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:49.526]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.546 --> 01:22:49.907]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.453 --> 01:23:02.035]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[01:23:02.255 --> 01:23:03.856]  You may have storable food questions.
[01:23:04.077 --> 01:23:08.641]  You may want to buy your freeze-dried foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[01:23:08.941 --> 01:23:10.523]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[01:23:10.723 --> 01:23:13.045]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[01:23:13.146 --> 01:23:15.968]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.
[01:23:16.008 --> 01:23:21.714]  military and other government agencies with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.

[01:23:38.864 --> 01:23:40.285]  Just add hot water and serve.
[01:23:40.485 --> 01:23:45.588]  Backpackers consistently rate us number one year after year as the best tasting and ease of preparation.
[01:23:45.828 --> 01:23:46.268]  Isn't that
[01:23:46.308 --> 01:23:47.029]  So think about this.
[01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:51.172]  All over the Western world, you have a learning disability, or you say that you're
[01:24:16.078 --> 01:24:20.359]  A victim of domestic violence, you get a divorce and still the state tries to take your children.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:25.821]  Our guest, member of parliament, is being very precise about these particular cases.
[01:24:26.482 --> 01:24:30.103]  I was just making the point that think about how amazing that is.
[01:24:30.183 --> 01:24:31.843]  She's away from her husband.
[01:24:33.004 --> 01:24:35.165]  He's saying in this particular case he didn't even punch her.
[01:24:38.914 --> 01:24:41.396]  Now they're saying yelling at your children is abuse.
[01:24:41.456 --> 01:24:42.476]  You know, don't run the street!
[01:24:42.576 --> 01:24:42.997]  No!
[01:24:43.737 --> 01:24:44.698]  And that's it.
[01:24:45.118 --> 01:24:47.520]  So continuing, sir, you were trying to go through this case.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.141]  So she's got two children.
[01:24:49.181 --> 01:24:49.981]  She's in Ireland.
[01:24:50.241 --> 01:24:50.982]  She's fighting it.
[01:24:51.122 --> 01:24:51.562]  Continue.
[01:24:51.922 --> 01:24:59.447]  Yeah, well, look, basically, what it is, is that, you know, they're trying to take the older child and put him in foster care in Devon.
[01:24:59.707 --> 01:25:00.068]  All right?
[01:25:01.068 --> 01:25:02.950]  And that just can't be sensible.
[01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:04.911]  It just can't be sensible.
[01:25:05.191 --> 01:25:08.113]  She's sitting there with two children, a younger one who's like two.
[01:25:08.931 --> 01:25:09.131]  I don't
[01:25:39.332 --> 01:25:42.774]  Her oldest son and putting him in care in Ireland.
[01:25:43.594 --> 01:25:44.634]  Who are these people?
[01:25:44.694 --> 01:25:45.595]  What's wrong with them?
[01:25:45.615 --> 01:25:46.615]  Don't they have any soul?
[01:25:46.695 --> 01:25:48.176]  I think it's completely mad.
[01:25:49.516 --> 01:25:50.817]  Completely and totally mad.
[01:25:50.837 --> 01:25:53.618]  There can't be any justification for that at all.
[01:25:53.998 --> 01:25:57.440]  Because if the children are at risk, then they're both at risk.
[01:25:59.581 --> 01:25:59.821]  Right?
[01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:00.621]  Not just one of them.
[01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:02.282]  You can't just take the one you can get.
[01:26:03.282 --> 01:26:07.544]  And if the local authority says, well, they're actually not at risk, then you should leave them alone.
[01:26:09.585 --> 01:26:18.089]  Well, how do they say, because she had an ex-husband that somehow was mean to her, that she now can't have her older child?
[01:26:18.569 --> 01:26:19.629]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:26:19.989 --> 01:26:30.354]  Well, I know, but the point about, apart from that, part of it is the irrationality of the decision in the first instance, which is you're taking completely the wrong actions.
[01:26:30.914 --> 01:26:33.475]  Actions that do screw up the children.
[01:26:33.575 --> 01:26:34.555]  There's no question about it.
[01:26:34.615 --> 01:26:38.557]  The actions of the state do a lot of damage to these children's lives.
[01:26:39.574 --> 01:26:40.715]  The evidence is there.
[01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:43.418]  It's more and more evidence as time goes by.
[01:26:43.438 --> 01:26:48.002]  And that isn't an argument for not taking children into care, ever.
[01:26:48.849 --> 01:26:55.472]  I mean, if you take the issue of learning difficulties, there is a wide range of things described as learning difficulties.
[01:26:55.532 --> 01:27:03.895]  And there are certain people who have severe learning difficulties where I myself would not take the view that they could cope with looking after children, right?
[01:27:03.915 --> 01:27:09.777]  So that's not, that's not, you know, I'm not somebody who says everybody with a learning difficulty has to look after their own child.
[01:27:10.975 --> 01:27:16.416]  What I say is that we get these decisions really badly wrong and that the checks and balances don't work.
[01:27:16.496 --> 01:27:21.857]  Well, you talk about a secret court where one out of a thousand times the parents get to keep their children.
[01:27:21.897 --> 01:27:22.998]  No, three out of a thousand.
[01:27:23.398 --> 01:27:24.698]  Three out of a thousand, okay.
[01:27:25.538 --> 01:27:26.458]  Yeah, it's .27%.
[01:27:28.599 --> 01:27:31.079]  So three out of a thousand, trying to get that number straight.
[01:27:31.559 --> 01:27:39.021]  What it is, and I'm sorry about being picky about this, the .27% is roughly three out of a thousand, isn't it?
[01:27:40.956 --> 01:28:02.186]  Now the point about it is that where the case is contested, remember there are various potential outcomes, it's possible that the local authority withdraws their application for a care order, but where it's actually a contested case, the parents win only in just under three out of a thousand cases, on the 2007 figures
[01:28:07.538 --> 01:28:13.340]  Are the people of England getting mad because there are no checks and balances and the state is running wild?
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.401]  Some are, but I find it odd because people just sit there and take it.
[01:28:19.722 --> 01:28:31.125]  I find it very, very odd because here you have some really dreadful activity and yet people just sit there and say, um-de-dum-de-dum-de, let's just get on with our lives, you know.
[01:28:32.228 --> 01:28:35.190]  Um, because it's this whole whole issue about miscarriages of justice.
[01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:38.153]  It's where do you, where do you start and where do you stop?
[01:28:38.193 --> 01:28:44.678]  It was, I don't know who was it, that pastor who said first they came for this and then they came for the, you know, then they came for the Jews and they came, you know.
[01:28:45.118 --> 01:28:51.623]  I can't remember the whole statement, but unless you actually fight injustice, um, it just gets to be a real mess.
[01:28:54.232 --> 01:28:57.493]  But what's wrong with the Child Protective Services?
[01:28:57.553 --> 01:28:58.833]  They know it's hurting children.
[01:28:58.853 --> 01:28:59.854]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:28:59.894 --> 01:29:00.754]  They know it's evil.
[01:29:01.094 --> 01:29:02.474]  They know their courts are a joke.
[01:29:02.854 --> 01:29:05.035]  I mean, who are these people?
[01:29:05.895 --> 01:29:11.777]  Well, you can understand, in a sense, why a lot of people have left the job.
[01:29:12.217 --> 01:29:13.637]  And there are so many vacancies.
[01:29:14.398 --> 01:29:18.819]  So we get child protection social workers from all sorts, including America, to be fair.
[01:29:19.159 --> 01:29:22.400]  America's not a bad idea, because at least we speak a similar language.
[01:29:23.069 --> 01:29:25.691]  So you're saying they're bringing foreigners in?
[01:29:42.219 --> 01:29:45.321]  Yeah, from all over the place, because they can't get English people to do it.
[01:29:45.341 --> 01:29:50.083]  Oh my God, so they've got foreign child kidnapping mercenaries.
[01:29:50.163 --> 01:29:50.564]  Stay there.
[01:29:51.004 --> 01:29:54.006]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.926 --> 01:29:57.608]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.076 --> 01:30:05.717]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:31:08.613 --> 01:31:13.417]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:19.661]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:19.821 --> 01:31:22.043]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.583 --> 01:31:23.965]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:31:23.985 --> 01:31:24.706]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:24.726 --> 01:31:26.848]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.485 --> 01:31:48.453]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:32:05.348 --> 01:32:08.052]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:32:08.092 --> 01:32:13.740]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:32:14.821 --> 01:32:17.862]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[01:32:17.882 --> 01:32:18.962]  We also have some specials.

[01:32:33.926 --> 01:32:35.626]  This film needs to be seen.

[01:33:06.371 --> 01:33:11.513]  Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament John Hemming joins us and see it always gets worse.
[01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:18.214]  I've noticed that a lot of the big city police department chiefs are foreigners now in the U.S.
[01:33:19.255 --> 01:33:30.098]  The majority of new recruits for the army are illegal aliens or recruited out of Mexico City, Manila, Philippines, Ukraine and
[01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:34.091]  To hear this Member of Parliament talk about foreigners.
[01:33:34.131 --> 01:33:37.873]  They're bringing in foreigners who I guess can't speak even very good English.
[01:33:38.733 --> 01:33:39.954]  I want to be clear with him on that.
[01:33:40.454 --> 01:33:41.875]  And then they take your children.
[01:33:42.902 --> 01:33:45.562]  Because they can't find English people to do it.
[01:33:45.723 --> 01:33:51.584]  And ladies and gentlemen, again, the good people get out because their conscience can't go along with this evil.
[01:33:51.904 --> 01:33:56.104]  And all you get left with is these heartless people who get bonuses the more kids they grab.
[01:33:56.924 --> 01:34:01.005]  And of course we have the elder services taking people's houses for themselves here.
[01:34:01.525 --> 01:34:03.205]  I've seen that in the British newspapers there.
[01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:05.766]  I mean, look, crooks go and join this.
[01:34:06.306 --> 01:34:07.666]  And I'll just come right out and say it.
[01:34:08.906 --> 01:34:11.707]  And there's a much greater evil and abuse of children
[01:34:12.447 --> 01:34:16.729]  Statistically, from what I've seen, committed by government, than what the supposed parents do.
[01:34:17.609 --> 01:34:26.774]  And, uh, so... It's just incredible, ladies and gentlemen, and there's no oversight, no way to stop these people, other than members of parliament fighting against it.
[01:34:26.814 --> 01:34:28.314]  So, sir, flesh that out.
[01:34:28.354 --> 01:34:30.275]  You're telling... I mean, do you have the statistics?
[01:34:30.755 --> 01:34:32.056]  I mean, can they speak English?
[01:34:32.076 --> 01:34:34.377]  I don't have all the statistics on exactly how many people come through the door.
[01:34:34.397 --> 01:34:35.077]  Can they speak English?
[01:34:35.157 --> 01:34:36.518]  I mean, so somebody shows up for...
[01:34:38.523 --> 01:34:40.044]  It's a question of Americans.
[01:34:40.064 --> 01:34:42.006]  Do you say Americans speak adequate English?
[01:34:42.266 --> 01:34:44.828]  I think probably adequate English, yeah, to be fair.
[01:34:44.848 --> 01:34:47.430]  But you were saying from Greece and Romania.
[01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:59.480]  Well, Greece, you see, again, obviously people learn English, but the underlying point is this, is why is it we cannot fill our vacancies with people from England?
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:00.781]  And in part it's because
[01:35:01.408 --> 01:35:03.569]  The job's got to be such a mess.
[01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:07.370]  And there are some really good people still working in this area.
[01:35:07.471 --> 01:35:10.392]  I don't sort of say that everybody's exactly the same.
[01:35:10.432 --> 01:35:11.472]  Of course, that's not the case.
[01:35:11.952 --> 01:35:13.713]  But it's a gradual process.
[01:35:13.813 --> 01:35:15.834]  And everyone says, oh, it's dreadful.
[01:35:15.874 --> 01:35:16.774]  We've got vacancies.
[01:35:16.794 --> 01:35:18.115]  We've got vacancies everywhere.
[01:35:18.135 --> 01:35:19.375]  We've got nobody to do the job.
[01:35:19.716 --> 01:35:23.657]  And they don't try to think, well, that's because you're trying to make people do a dreadful job.
[01:35:25.418 --> 01:35:27.359]  In other countries, they don't have the same problems.
[01:35:27.659 --> 01:35:30.640]  I don't know what about America, but in other countries across Europe, they don't have the
[01:35:31.644 --> 01:35:40.648]  No, I mean you go to New York or L.A., it's mainly cops can't speak English and they love ruling you because they came from countries that were third world police states.
[01:35:41.388 --> 01:35:45.170]  I can't comment about America because I haven't been there for some time to be honest, so I don't know.
[01:35:45.734 --> 01:35:54.966]  But sir, I mean, going through this specifically, you're saying, I mean, is it a large portion are foreigners who speak broken English are seizing the children?
[01:35:55.447 --> 01:35:57.290]  I don't actually know the proportion.
[01:35:57.310 --> 01:36:03.298]  What I do know is that there are material numbers who are brought into the country to fill the vacancies.
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:04.960]  I wouldn't.
[01:36:05.141 --> 01:36:06.202]  That's not what I see.
[01:36:06.442 --> 01:36:07.944]  That's a symptom of a problem.
[01:36:08.025 --> 01:36:16.897]  To be fair, the normal theoretical role of trying to look after children and everything else should be a relatively nice thing to do, although sometimes you get conflict.
[01:36:17.558 --> 01:36:20.682]  But this is actually ending up as massively aggressive.
[01:36:22.544 --> 01:36:26.285]  And so people are voting with their feet and getting out as quickly as they can.
[01:36:26.705 --> 01:36:27.425]  Talk about that!
[01:36:27.485 --> 01:36:30.566]  We see a massive exodus out of England of real Brits.
[01:36:31.446 --> 01:36:35.587]  We see an exodus out of Scotland as well.
[01:36:36.048 --> 01:36:38.328]  Speak about that and then some of the other horror stories.
[01:36:38.368 --> 01:36:40.649]  There are migratory issues, but there always has been migration.
[01:36:40.689 --> 01:36:43.870]  Birmingham is a city built on two types of migration.
[01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:45.070]  One is in and one's out.
[01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:49.293]  And across the world, there are around about 20 Birmingham's, including a few in our area.
[01:36:49.653 --> 01:36:52.376]  I think you've got about five or so in America, haven't you?
[01:36:52.396 --> 01:36:53.717]  Something like five Birmingham's.
[01:36:54.337 --> 01:36:54.978]  Like Detroit?
[01:36:56.599 --> 01:36:58.180]  Well, there's Birmingham, Alabama.
[01:37:00.282 --> 01:37:02.524]  You've got other, I don't know, there's a number of places called Birmingham.
[01:37:02.544 --> 01:37:05.366]  Oh, you're saying the name from Birmingham, people moving from Birmingham?
[01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:09.089]  I don't mean out in motor type cities, but I mean places that you're being filmed.
[01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:12.752]  But I've seen English people interviewed saying they are leaving because of the police state.
[01:37:13.906 --> 01:37:14.786]  That may be true.
[01:37:15.867 --> 01:37:22.989]  There could be all sorts of reasons to want to go and the fact that they're sort of like setting things up to trap people so they can charge fines to people.
[01:37:23.729 --> 01:37:25.370]  You know, one of the stealth tax systems.
[01:37:26.970 --> 01:37:29.091]  So, you know, there are more and more ways.
[01:37:29.331 --> 01:37:38.034]  There was a beautiful one recently where I believe somebody was fined by a police officer £60 for littering for dropping a £10 note.
[01:37:38.094 --> 01:37:40.295]  Have you picked that one up?
[01:37:40.315 --> 01:37:43.076]  I mean, they obviously dropped it on accident.
[01:37:44.005 --> 01:37:47.067]  Well, you know, one assumes so, yes.
[01:37:47.347 --> 01:37:50.949]  They've dropped a £10 note and they're fined £60 for doing so.
[01:37:51.229 --> 01:38:06.038]  But I've seen reports in the news where they'll watch cafes and if a potato chip flies off the table, the police run over, you know, before a bird can grab it and start writing them tickets just greedily like piranha.
[01:38:06.398 --> 01:38:07.519]  I've not spotted that one.
[01:38:07.559 --> 01:38:14.705]  I have seen somebody who was being prosecuted for blowing his nose in a parked car.
[01:38:17.227 --> 01:38:18.628]  Blowing his nose in a car?
[01:38:18.928 --> 01:38:19.809]  Yeah, blowing his nose.
[01:38:20.049 --> 01:38:21.811]  He was not in control of the car.
[01:38:23.252 --> 01:38:24.353]  Because he blew his nose.
[01:38:26.995 --> 01:38:28.696]  Yeah, they're doing that now, where you even have a cell phone.
[01:38:28.716 --> 01:38:31.279]  Well, it's a way of making money, you see.
[01:38:31.359 --> 01:38:33.901]  They get a target to go and get so many fines.
[01:38:35.748 --> 01:38:44.153]  And one of the ploys they have with speed cameras in England is to have a large solid six-lane highway and then they take the speed limit down to trap people.
[01:38:44.974 --> 01:38:47.155]  And then they put in a speed camera and it clocks up the money.
[01:38:50.157 --> 01:39:04.526]  So literally it's a bunch of foreign pirates and others... You can put it that way, but you see, the point is that within the system there are people doing a good job, but within the system there are people doing a dismal job.
[01:39:05.695 --> 01:39:12.556]  But the leadership is directing them to be more and more pernicious, more and more predatory.
[01:39:12.576 --> 01:39:13.376]  More aggressive.
[01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:15.397]  So they have more and more references going through.
[01:39:15.417 --> 01:39:16.757]  It gets more and more overloaded.
[01:39:17.157 --> 01:39:22.398]  They bring in a computer system which is set up so once you've made a judgment you can't easily change it.
[01:39:23.358 --> 01:39:28.199]  And they put pressure on not what judgments you make but how quickly you make adjustments.
[01:39:28.219 --> 01:39:32.700]  So an initial assessment has to be done within seven days and a core assessment in 35 days.
[01:39:34.914 --> 01:39:39.591]  And what happens is that you're putting pressure on people to make rapid decisions.
[01:39:40.168 --> 01:39:45.110]  Well, I saw a story about 2,000 cameras, now 20,000 cameras.
[01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:51.732]  Now I've read reports they want everybody at birth because they can't get neighbors to rat on neighbors.
[01:39:52.112 --> 01:39:54.632]  Everyone has cameras in the house if they have their way.
[01:39:54.652 --> 01:39:56.813]  Well, I think that's pushing.
[01:39:57.833 --> 01:40:03.195]  The examples I cite, I can go back to source and give you information on.
[01:40:03.275 --> 01:40:04.515]  No, but that's in your newspapers.
[01:40:04.555 --> 01:40:05.216]  Have you seen that?
[01:40:05.256 --> 01:40:09.577]  Where they're making newborn families have cameras in the home watching them?
[01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:20.581]  Yes, well they've done that in what are called assessment centres for some time, and they are a bit like that with cameras all over the place.
[01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:32.326]  The problem is, when you actually look at the underlying question, we're supposed to be trying to reduce the number of children that die from child abuse and neglect, which I think is a reasonable objective to set.
[01:40:33.246 --> 01:40:42.809]  And yet, actually, when you take the issue of serious incident notifications and compare the figures from 2008 to 2009, they've gone up by 23%.
[01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.050]  So it's failing.
[01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:51.932]  Well, we've had an epidemic of foster care and in government custody, children dying.
[01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:59.535]  And I played a famous clip in Arkansas where the CPS head says, children will die, it's not our problem.
[01:41:00.075 --> 01:41:01.916]  So why have them then?
[01:41:03.254 --> 01:41:10.023]  Well, exactly, but the point is that they're now trying to say, yelling at your child, we will take it.
[01:41:10.403 --> 01:41:14.068]  I know, I know, but they don't care if the child dies, but they do care if you yell at it.
[01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:18.554]  Well, they're saying they don't care if it dies in their custody.
[01:41:19.114 --> 01:41:19.875]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[01:41:19.915 --> 01:41:20.836]  Well, that's not very good, is it?
[01:41:21.485 --> 01:41:22.805]  In fact, guys, they won't believe it.
[01:41:22.965 --> 01:41:26.827]  Go to YouTube and type in, CPS worker says children will die.
[01:41:27.287 --> 01:41:29.787]  And the newscast starts with him going, I'm not worried about it.
[01:41:30.348 --> 01:41:34.389]  Two children in the small town in one week die in government care.
[01:41:34.409 --> 01:41:35.969]  And he goes, doesn't matter.
[01:41:36.469 --> 01:41:37.249]  No big deal.
[01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:38.730]  We're doing good.
[01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:39.430]  We're the government.
[01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:40.770]  Yeah, I know.
[01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:42.191]  It's just lack of accountability.
[01:41:42.947 --> 01:41:43.888]  Well, I'll tell you what I found.
[01:41:44.448 --> 01:41:46.349]  They're also hiring in the U.S.
[01:41:46.409 --> 01:41:48.010]  now from the welfare roles.
[01:41:49.110 --> 01:41:55.594]  I mean, literally, no exaggeration, half of the people I talk to who are on welfare are going to school.
[01:41:55.614 --> 01:42:05.539]  I'm talking about women with seven kids, you know, driving around in brand new cars and all the welfare money they get, and they're all going to school to be CPS workers.
[01:42:07.284 --> 01:42:08.385]  Well, it's one of these things.
[01:42:09.025 --> 01:42:17.010]  You get a vacancy, you're trying to get desperate to get people to do it, so they reduce the standard.
[01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:19.832]  Frankly, you couldn't run it worse than they do.
[01:42:19.852 --> 01:42:23.054]  Give us your website, sir.
[01:42:24.094 --> 01:42:27.677]  Well, I've got various, but johnhemming.blogspot.com is one of them, the web blog.
[01:42:31.058 --> 01:42:33.421]  John Hemming dot blogspot dot com.
[01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:37.465]  I've got various bits and bobs on there and then I've got John Hemming dot name as well.
[01:42:39.347 --> 01:42:48.136]  I put some of the things on there but it is quite difficult because you have to get to a situation where you can talk about these things and some of them get trapped by the secrecy of the courts.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:43:04.734]  Well, bottom line, sir, having kangaroo courts where three out of a thousand are found not guilty, where the one government expert comes in, no one else is allowed to have any witnesses... You wouldn't believe it happens, but it does.
[01:43:05.242 --> 01:43:08.203]  You are guilty until proven guilty until proven a slave of the state.
[01:43:08.924 --> 01:43:15.847]  I mean overall you talk about how it's really hurting children to be in these dormitories when they take them before placement.
[01:43:16.307 --> 01:43:17.488]  They're not dormitories.
[01:43:18.088 --> 01:43:20.729]  There are situations which aren't very good.
[01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:26.252]  Well I've actually seen the reports out of England and here in the US but I mean I agree you're the expert.
[01:43:26.292 --> 01:43:26.692]  You're there.
[01:43:26.732 --> 01:43:28.233]  You're really tackling it.
[01:43:28.253 --> 01:43:33.395]  The point about it is the care is not adequate and it causes long-term damage.
[01:43:34.431 --> 01:43:40.393]  Well, my point is, from all the statistics I've seen, the government does a lot more harm than good.
[01:43:40.413 --> 01:43:46.775]  I think as it currently stands, yes, that's the case, but that doesn't mean that inherently it need be the case.
[01:43:47.915 --> 01:43:52.996]  But the government shows no intention of fixing this anywhere in the world we see this.
[01:43:53.016 --> 01:43:54.937]  You know, the Soviets loved it, Hitler loved it.
[01:43:55.177 --> 01:43:56.878]  This is what authoritarian systems do.
[01:43:56.898 --> 01:43:57.958]  They want
[01:43:58.717 --> 01:43:59.498]  I mean, look at North Korea.
[01:43:59.518 --> 01:44:13.207]  I don't know if you've seen the documentaries about how large populations live in these work camps, and five days a year they'll put a man with a woman in a cell, and then they produce a child, it's sent to another camp, and they say this is how the state rules, there is no family.
[01:44:13.967 --> 01:44:15.749]  Yeah, I suppose there's an element of that.
[01:44:15.769 --> 01:44:21.292]  I think, you know... But I mean, maybe North Korea's doing it right, according to... maybe it's a heaven!
[01:44:21.693 --> 01:44:23.414]  Maybe we're the kooks!
[01:44:23.794 --> 01:44:25.095]  Maybe we're the kooks, John!
[01:44:28.674 --> 01:44:29.315]  I don't think so.
[01:44:29.355 --> 01:44:43.665]  I think the difficulty is, it's what one of my colleagues was referring to, the rule of the celebrity, where there gets to be more and more media interest in sort of what's well known because it's well known.
[01:44:44.606 --> 01:44:48.409]  And there's little judgment used as to what's right and what's wrong.
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:59.262]  Well, clearly, and I have the textbooks, I'm sure you're well read, but have you read what they teach social workers, how the families are bad?
[01:44:59.282 --> 01:45:03.502]  Well, I'd have to see the documents.
[01:45:03.542 --> 01:45:08.283]  You see, I know there are lots of different views and people tend to have their own ideologies.
[01:45:08.343 --> 01:45:15.625]  And again, one of the things about not having proper accountability is if somebody's got their own little pet subject, right?
[01:45:16.045 --> 01:45:19.387]  So some are obsessed that children should never be smacked, right?
[01:45:19.448 --> 01:45:22.330]  And so they go around removing any child that's smacked.
[01:45:24.211 --> 01:45:27.293]  And that's sort of different motivations for different people.
[01:45:27.793 --> 01:45:32.116]  And the parameters in which they operate are not sufficiently adequately controlled.
[01:45:33.717 --> 01:45:36.780]  Well, it's not illegal to smack your child in the U.S.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.241]  when they keep running out in traffic.
[01:45:38.501 --> 01:45:39.702]  You just can't hurt them.
[01:45:40.342 --> 01:45:41.283]  How is it in England?
[01:45:41.843 --> 01:45:44.405]  It's a sort of similar-ish situation.
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:55.024]  You've got some people who are obsessed that you should never ever smack a child, which is, I think, complete nonsense.
[01:45:55.044 --> 01:46:00.886]  The problem is they can go and run riot in the child protection system, going around protecting children from being smacked.
[01:46:02.247 --> 01:46:05.612]  Yeah, but what about problems with Child Protective Services abusing children?
[01:46:05.993 --> 01:46:07.275]  I mean, raping them, you name it.
[01:46:07.315 --> 01:46:08.236]  It's rampant here.
[01:46:08.717 --> 01:46:17.391]  Well, we've made a bit of progress here because we now have the General Social Care Council, which does actually strike social workers off when they rape their children in their care.
[01:46:19.036 --> 01:46:20.076]  So that's an improvement.
[01:46:20.417 --> 01:46:21.917]  But they don't get imprisoned, I guess.
[01:46:22.237 --> 01:46:25.178]  No, I don't think that.
[01:46:25.199 --> 01:46:28.280]  There have been problems with that, there's no question.
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.640]  There's problems in the past with the abuse.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:31.701]  Yeah, because where does a smart pedophile go?
[01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:35.303]  He doesn't go to school grounds trying to lure kids into his van.
[01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:40.485]  He goes and becomes a, you know, let's say you're a Romanian, or let's say you're a Greek pedophile.
[01:46:40.525 --> 01:46:43.386]  You just move to jolly old England and let the raping begin.
[01:46:43.746 --> 01:46:48.532]  Yeah, well that's why you need real accountability and I worry about how many children get lost as well, you see.
[01:46:49.033 --> 01:46:50.775]  Oh yeah, lost!
[01:46:50.815 --> 01:46:56.942]  We had 3,000 plus disappear in CPS custody in Florida and CNN just said they're gone!
[01:46:58.152 --> 01:46:59.914]  Yeah, I know, it's not good enough at all.
[01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:01.755]  So, you have them disappearing too?
[01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:02.916]  If I'd lost a child, I'd be worried.
[01:47:02.936 --> 01:47:07.420]  Because sometimes the social worker gets a little mad and maybe chops the head off and buries them in the back?
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:20.150]  I think that's obviously a bit of an extreme case, but I think the concern I have is that we have figures as to how many children are lost, but there's no proper audit of the process at all.
[01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:24.734]  The whole system is very, very resistive to any auditing process.
[01:47:25.046 --> 01:47:27.889]  Yeah, it's just designed so they can have their party and that's the end of it.
[01:47:27.909 --> 01:47:30.050]  I mean, did you hear about the Texas Youth Commission?
[01:47:30.371 --> 01:47:32.072]  Where they had rape parties of the children?
[01:47:33.073 --> 01:47:34.034]  I didn't hear about it.
[01:47:34.094 --> 01:47:36.056]  I know things like that used to go on in Jersey.
[01:47:36.076 --> 01:47:43.262]  I don't know if you know, I had an exiled senator from Jersey staying with me for a couple of months.
[01:47:43.923 --> 01:47:51.009]  He revealed on his weblog the details of a failed investigation into a nurse who'd been murdering patients.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:54.480]  In Jersey, which is an island just off France.
[01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:58.382]  It's what's called a Crown Dependency, so it's not part of the United Kingdom.
[01:47:59.363 --> 01:48:02.284]  But it is linked up in various complex ways.
[01:48:02.344 --> 01:48:03.065]  It's a protectorate.
[01:48:04.906 --> 01:48:07.087]  I don't know what a protectorate is, but it's a Crown Dependency.
[01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:14.730]  It's sort of part of the wider, you know, bits like Gibraltar and Guernsey and Jersey and the Isle of Man and things like that.
[01:48:15.591 --> 01:48:17.572]  It's like the Azores are part of Portugal.
[01:48:17.892 --> 01:48:18.132]  Sorry?
[01:48:18.452 --> 01:48:20.053]  It's like the Azores are part of Portugal.
[01:48:21.354 --> 01:48:30.418]  Yeah, I don't know whether the Azores may be actually part of Portugal, but the difference is that they don't have MPs in Parliament, they have their own government.
[01:48:31.698 --> 01:48:42.742]  And what the hierarchy, the oligarchs there decided to do, was because he had revealed about this botched investigation, that they would prosecute him under the Data Protection Act.
[01:48:42.782 --> 01:48:49.345]  So he did a runner from Jersey, and he was staying with me for a couple of months, but he's gone on now to go and stay with an old police officer.
[01:48:50.943 --> 01:49:01.247]  Well, there's no doubt, I mean, government, no matter how you try to make it work well, the bigger it gets, the more abusive it gets, and is there any sign of reform?
[01:49:01.307 --> 01:49:02.448]  I mean, you've got some...
[01:49:19.784 --> 01:49:22.425]  Accountability and transparency are the key thing.
[01:49:23.565 --> 01:49:25.086]  So it's absolute.
[01:49:25.146 --> 01:49:28.486]  And within that, you have to allow people to blow the whistle.
[01:49:29.127 --> 01:49:42.210]  And one of the problems we have with the government here is under pressure from the practitioners, that is the people who make money out of child protection, they're bringing in a law to mean that you have to keep anonymous anyone who was ever involved in one of these cases.
[01:49:43.171 --> 01:49:44.271]  And that's just dreadful.
[01:49:47.537 --> 01:49:52.961]  Well, we have rewards here for it, so people just make full livings lying about folks.
[01:49:53.702 --> 01:49:54.202]  Yeah, I know.
[01:49:54.763 --> 01:50:01.868]  That's an interesting problem, where you have a different standard of proof for criminal proceedings and for civil proceedings.
[01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:04.430]  Well, you know what set up the family court.
[01:50:04.450 --> 01:50:06.112]  I mean, it was set up as eugenics courts.
[01:50:07.373 --> 01:50:16.640]  I don't know what your system is, but here we have a problem with people getting compensation for criminal injuries that are just basically made up.
[01:50:18.115 --> 01:50:22.339]  Oh yeah, every day, literally, I see articles where some crackhead wants more crack.
[01:50:22.619 --> 01:50:26.082]  So they go point at some old woman's house and say, I bought the crack there.
[01:50:26.102 --> 01:50:27.283]  And they go, here's a thousand.
[01:50:27.584 --> 01:50:31.947]  And the SWAT team goes in and guns down the old woman and just says, hey, we're the police.
[01:50:31.988 --> 01:50:33.088]  We're taking care of you.
[01:50:33.569 --> 01:50:34.490]  That's the end of it.
[01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:43.835]  Well, I tell you, it's been an amazing interview with Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, and it's johnhemming.blogspot.com.
[01:50:44.275 --> 01:50:50.539]  Sir, thank you so much for spending time with us, and please, please keep standing up against the creatures.
[01:50:50.599 --> 01:50:52.980]  Fighting injustice, as I said, it's important.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.543]  Much like I don't agree with you on what you say on everything, but I think it is important to fight injustice and highlight what's going on.
[01:50:58.623 --> 01:50:59.484]  Thank you so much.
[01:51:00.675 --> 01:51:02.776]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[01:51:03.096 --> 01:51:06.577]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.

[01:51:58.069 --> 01:52:00.331]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[01:52:02.193 --> 01:52:05.836]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.216 --> 01:52:09.219]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.459 --> 01:52:10.861]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:52:11.559 --> 01:52:14.220]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:20.463]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.624 --> 01:52:25.666]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:25.686 --> 01:52:35.791]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:35.911 --> 01:52:38.032]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:38.272 --> 01:52:39.593]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:42.134]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.314 --> 01:52:44.155]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.435 --> 01:52:49.218]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:53:00.632 --> 01:53:00.972]  Hello.

[01:53:06.057 --> 01:53:10.540]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:53:10.881 --> 01:53:15.665]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:53:16.025 --> 01:53:19.946]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[01:53:20.106 --> 01:53:24.027]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[01:53:24.147 --> 01:53:26.688]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[01:53:26.948 --> 01:53:27.848]  It was empowering.
[01:53:27.968 --> 01:53:31.869]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[01:53:31.949 --> 01:53:34.770]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:37.511]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[01:53:37.531 --> 01:53:38.391]  Thank you so much.
[01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:41.372]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[01:53:41.452 --> 01:53:42.032]  Thanks again.
[01:53:42.212 --> 01:53:44.833]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[01:53:45.606 --> 01:53:48.609]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:52.433]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:53:52.593 --> 01:53:59.801]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[01:54:04.926 --> 01:54:06.708]  Think about the magnitude.
[01:54:08.115 --> 01:54:08.495]  I don't know.
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:31.561]  More than two-thirds of children in the U.S.
[01:54:31.601 --> 01:54:34.042]  are on psychotropic drugs that are in government care.
[01:54:34.663 --> 01:54:36.083]  They grab you when you cry.
[01:54:36.123 --> 01:54:38.985]  They say you're mentally ill because you're five years old and want your mommy.
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:55:01.869]  The neighbor saw you yell at your child, they called the CPS, or you were homeschooling, and the neighbor thinks that's illegal, and they show up and take your kids, and they disappear, they kill them, they rape them, and then you talk to the social workers, you see them on the news, they're laughing, it's funny, you know, you say, you guys are abusing children, oh no we're not.
[01:55:02.630 --> 01:55:07.352]  People who know social workers say they're proud of what they're doing.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.243]  And it is a scourge.
[01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:11.204]  It is a plague.
[01:55:11.584 --> 01:55:12.305]  Hitler did it.
[01:55:12.726 --> 01:55:13.767]  The Communists did it.
[01:55:14.228 --> 01:55:15.189]  Pol Pot did it.
[01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:19.895]  And, I mean, authoritarian orphanages are famous.
[01:55:20.015 --> 01:55:21.717]  This is the system
[01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:25.993]  Waging war on humanity.
[01:55:26.714 --> 01:55:38.205]  Now I've covered all of Obama's announcements in his budget to jack up taxes and break all his promises and get rid of insurance exemptions and home exemptions and tax people making $200,000 combined incomes.
[01:55:38.225 --> 01:55:40.007]  That's people making $100,000 basically apiece.
[01:55:43.811 --> 01:55:49.138]  Uh, just George Soros's Media Matters says Obama never said he wasn't going to tax people making $200,000.
[01:55:49.318 --> 01:55:55.166]  Just complete lying, because George Soros wants your money paid to him through the central banks.
[01:55:55.907 --> 01:55:58.470]  We've got South Australia government, gags, internet.
[01:55:59.051 --> 01:56:01.632]  Debate, that's news.com.au.
[01:56:02.692 --> 01:56:21.175]  I want to get into, also in my stack I've got some Monsanto news, some of the new products they're rolling out, like SmartStack, that has eight genetically engineered traits, six of them live pesticides that the plant grows internally to kill bugs that eat it.
[01:56:21.315 --> 01:56:22.696]  But then you're going to eat that.
[01:56:25.356 --> 01:56:26.517]  I mean, this is madness.
[01:56:26.777 --> 01:56:28.537]  This is just pure lunacy.
[01:56:29.622 --> 01:56:35.324]  And you've got dumbed-down, heartless, brutish, stupid enforcers who love it.
[01:56:35.905 --> 01:56:37.005]  They love the power.
[01:56:37.826 --> 01:56:41.587]  You talk about the average bureaucrat or enforcer, they're dumber than a box of rocks.
[01:56:41.947 --> 01:56:43.728]  They don't care if they're drinking fluoride water.
[01:56:44.388 --> 01:56:46.949]  They don't care if they're eating GMO food, rotting their liver.
[01:56:47.290 --> 01:56:53.972]  They think it's funny, because all they know is they've got a machine gun, and they're going to get your guns, and they're going to have their way with you.
[01:56:54.293 --> 01:56:55.573]  That's what happens in 99% of societies
[01:56:57.694 --> 01:57:00.736]  And it's happening here through scientific design.
[01:57:02.156 --> 01:57:09.440]  We're going to open the phones up for 20 minutes in the next hour, and then I'm going to cover news for the rest, and I have some audio clips I want to play.
[01:57:10.421 --> 01:57:21.027]  We had a caller yesterday, Funkmaster5 on YouTube, and he sent us a link to some of the phone calls he's been making to Talk Radio, and I wanted to play a clip of Hannity
[01:57:22.276 --> 01:57:34.803]  A clip of Savage, a clip of Beck, and then a clip of one other guy, Dennis Miller, to illustrate the different disinfo styles.
[01:57:35.423 --> 01:57:37.505]  And Savage, again, didn't put out disinfo.
[01:57:37.525 --> 01:57:39.005]  He said, yeah, Bohemian Grove's real.
[01:57:39.406 --> 01:57:42.928]  Bunch of disgusting old fat Republicans running around having sex with each other.
[01:57:43.348 --> 01:57:45.069]  I can't imagine anything more horrifying.
[01:57:46.098 --> 01:57:50.862]  Savage is the only one when Funkmaster5 called in who actually was honest.
[01:57:50.922 --> 01:57:55.026]  Again, I'm not on some savage worshipping binge here.
[01:57:55.646 --> 01:57:59.830]  It's just that he is just getting better and better and better and better and better.
[01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:02.152]  Saying Obama's gonna stage terror attacks.
[01:58:02.172 --> 01:58:03.633]  Obama staged the underwear bombing.
[01:58:03.974 --> 01:58:04.714]  Yeah, there's a bunch of...
[01:58:05.686 --> 01:58:08.168]  Fat Republicans wallowing around having sex.
[01:58:08.888 --> 01:58:10.610]  He lives in San Francisco, he should know.
[01:58:10.630 --> 01:58:15.293]  I mean, the point is, is I've gotta, I've gotta play this clip coming up, because it's just too good.
[01:58:15.513 --> 01:58:21.497]  And the others, I mean, you'll, you'll see reality illustrated next to Beck and others, you'll see the difference.
[01:58:21.817 --> 01:58:31.164]  So we're gonna analyze and kind of, like a wine tasting, a, a sess tasting event here, where we sample some of the different
[01:58:33.186 --> 01:58:34.508]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.868 --> 01:58:53.469]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:53.869 --> 01:58:58.851]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.212 --> 01:59:00.952]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.252 --> 01:59:06.074]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.254 --> 01:59:07.215]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.435 --> 01:59:08.175]  When do you want it?
[01:59:08.555 --> 01:59:10.156]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.456 --> 01:59:11.277]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.517 --> 01:59:13.578]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:13.718 --> 01:59:14.818]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.058 --> 01:59:16.379]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:17.039 --> 01:59:18.960]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.662]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:21.842 --> 01:59:25.044]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:25.424 --> 01:59:28.926]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.246 --> 01:59:30.247]  How much will you need?
[01:59:30.487 --> 01:59:31.087]  We don't know.
[01:59:31.387 --> 01:59:32.308]  How much do you want?
[01:59:32.488 --> 01:59:33.228]  All you can get.
[01:59:33.409 --> 01:59:34.109]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.509 --> 01:59:37.271]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:37.552 --> 01:59:39.733]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:39.753 --> 01:59:40.774]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:40.794 --> 01:59:41.935]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:41.975 --> 01:59:43.796]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:08.399 --> 02:00:11.100]  Well, it's already hour number four.
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:12.441]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:13.201 --> 02:00:27.428]  I want to run through a smattering of phone calls, then I'm going to get into the latest on Monsanto, internet censorship, and I want to play four different radio clips to show different styles of disinformation by mainstream fake neocons.
[02:00:27.768 --> 02:00:28.428]  That's coming up.
[02:00:28.508 --> 02:00:30.189]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[02:00:30.209 --> 02:00:32.530]  Chris in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:00:33.832 --> 02:00:35.314]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:00:35.334 --> 02:00:36.234]  Great to be on with you.
[02:00:36.254 --> 02:00:37.456]  I have a question.
[02:00:37.476 --> 02:00:57.575]  I've been going through, I'm reading Ron Paul's End the Fed book, blowing me away, and I wanted to ask you, first of all, if you've heard anything about how the Audit the Fed movement's going, but I wanted to ask you, what do you think the likelihood is that we could possibly end the Fed someday, and how would that impact the globalist agenda?
[02:00:58.993 --> 02:01:17.498]  Well, if we actually got Congress over the money and educated the public about it and ended fractional reserve banking, we would go back to, on average, 10% growth rates that we had from 1786 until 1913, roughly, instead of the new parasite economy that we live under.
[02:01:17.538 --> 02:01:19.338]  The problem is they're financial terrorists.
[02:01:19.658 --> 02:01:22.319]  They will incrementally wreck the economy to consolidate it.
[02:01:22.419 --> 02:01:25.520]  That's their goal, to end industrialized civilization.
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:33.183]  Get a manageable group of humans they can control of no more than 500 million, and that's stated by the NASA scientists, by the UN people.
[02:01:33.223 --> 02:01:38.845]  I mean, I had Mark Moreno, Climate Depot, on yesterday quoting the book by the head NASA climate scientist.
[02:01:39.165 --> 02:01:42.387]  You know, open population reduction.
[02:01:43.107 --> 02:01:45.408]  And so they're going to engage in terrorism.
[02:01:45.728 --> 02:01:50.190]  But if you identify that they're the financial terrorist, then they won't be able to get away with it.
[02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:51.170]  So it's a process.
[02:01:51.210 --> 02:01:52.211]  We don't have a choice.
[02:01:53.171 --> 02:01:54.612]  But, I mean, does that answer your question?
[02:01:55.822 --> 02:01:56.522]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:01:56.602 --> 02:01:57.622]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:01:57.642 --> 02:01:58.463]  I know you've got other people.
[02:01:58.523 --> 02:01:59.043]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:01:59.423 --> 02:02:00.243]  God bless you, Chris.
[02:02:00.263 --> 02:02:01.063]  Appreciate the call.
[02:02:01.343 --> 02:02:02.844]  How is the, oh, the other part of your question.
[02:02:02.884 --> 02:02:04.164]  How is the In the Fed movement going?
[02:02:04.464 --> 02:02:05.284]  It passed the House.
[02:02:05.344 --> 02:02:06.084]  It's in the Senate.
[02:02:06.424 --> 02:02:07.865]  They were unable to water it down.
[02:02:08.485 --> 02:02:11.105]  The Senate's getting more and more co-sponsors all the time.
[02:02:11.125 --> 02:02:15.666]  And as heat gets put on the bankers, it's only a matter of time until it passes.
[02:02:16.166 --> 02:02:20.947]  If it doesn't pass in this Congress, they'll reintroduce it in the House again, and it'll probably pass the next time.
[02:02:20.987 --> 02:02:23.508]  But we're identifying the real government.
[02:02:24.028 --> 02:02:31.651]  And we've gone from maybe 10% knowing the Federal Reserve is private, run for profit and predatory, to now over 90% in major polls.
[02:02:31.691 --> 02:02:33.251]  It was 75% a year ago.
[02:02:33.851 --> 02:02:35.932]  So, the awakening has happened.
[02:02:36.092 --> 02:02:37.813]  Now we've just got to clean these people out.
[02:02:38.493 --> 02:02:40.714]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eddie in Florida.
[02:02:40.814 --> 02:02:41.574]  Eddie, you're on the air.
[02:02:42.492 --> 02:02:43.092]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:02:43.133 --> 02:02:44.253]  Thanks for opening my eyes.
[02:02:44.393 --> 02:02:45.714]  I've been listening for a while.
[02:02:45.774 --> 02:02:47.756]  Somebody woke me up about two years ago.
[02:02:48.376 --> 02:02:48.737]  Welcome.
[02:02:48.757 --> 02:02:52.299]  By the way, I thought he was crazy, and it set me out on this quest for knowledge.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:54.101]  I just wanted to make a couple of points.
[02:02:54.561 --> 02:03:02.407]  I hear on your program a lot of the places, people saying, you know, why in light of all of us knowing what they're doing, why do they keep pushing forward?
[02:03:03.147 --> 02:03:04.228]  I think it's pretty obvious.
[02:03:04.248 --> 02:03:09.872]  You know, they orchestrated this economic collapse, but they cannot control every aspect of the economy.
[02:03:10.433 --> 02:03:11.694]  So I think what's happening is,
[02:03:12.409 --> 02:03:17.793]  You know, with the cap and trade and everything else they're doing to enslave us, I think they're going for broke while everyone's asleep.
[02:03:18.393 --> 02:03:25.638]  Because if the dollar collapses and everything else that's going to happen happens before they get all these things through, I don't think it's going to work.
[02:03:25.658 --> 02:03:26.759]  It's going to be too late.
[02:03:26.799 --> 02:03:27.399]  No, that's it.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:28.240]  That's it.
[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:41.409]  They're in a race to get their NORTHCOM, Homeland Security, and carbon tax grid in to make sure we are so destitute and just trying to pay our bills that we can't stand up against them.
[02:03:41.929 --> 02:03:42.650]  They know the U.S.
[02:03:42.730 --> 02:03:43.631]  Giant, the people.
[02:03:43.751 --> 02:03:44.992]  Once we wake up, that's it.
[02:03:45.052 --> 02:03:45.673]  Game's over.
[02:03:45.973 --> 02:03:55.382]  I mean, you know, they... Listen, when Jackson pushed out the central bank originally, you know, they still controlled the press then like they do now, and they made his life miserable.
[02:03:55.642 --> 02:03:57.484]  And that's why I think they're so arrogant about it.
[02:03:57.744 --> 02:04:00.727]  You know, I mean, you look at... I read the book from Jekyll Allen.
[02:04:01.327 --> 02:04:01.687]  Absolutely.
[02:04:01.707 --> 02:04:06.409]  Thomas Jefferson, to paraphrase him, said, if you allow private banks to control the issuance of currency and credit,
[02:04:29.514 --> 02:04:32.696]  Our children will wake up homeless on the continent we conquered.
[02:04:33.177 --> 02:04:42.703]  He also said that if you took all the power away from the bankers and gave them the power to issue currency and credit with a stroke of a pen, they would buy back the entire world.
[02:04:43.124 --> 02:04:43.764]  Through fraud.
[02:04:43.924 --> 02:04:47.267]  It's a bunch of made-off, Ken Lay types.
[02:04:48.689 --> 02:04:51.852]  Doing whatever they want to us, and that arrogance is a front.
[02:04:53.173 --> 02:04:56.176]  A aura of infallibility, of invincibility.
[02:04:56.376 --> 02:04:59.659]  They are not invincible, they are pot-bellied degenerate scum.
[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:01.601]  What's your home worth?
[02:05:01.781 --> 02:05:03.703]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:05:03.883 --> 02:05:06.606]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:05:06.906 --> 02:05:14.432]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of the tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[02:08:08.231 --> 02:08:11.972]  Okay, I'm going to talk to Daniel, Josh, Annette, and Lance, and that's it for calls.
[02:08:11.992 --> 02:08:14.472]  I've got a bunch of news and clips I want to play here today.
[02:08:15.072 --> 02:08:19.433]  I want to just remind listeners, we have the online video bookstore, Slash Patriot Apparel.
[02:08:20.373 --> 02:08:24.474]  Getting the word out, being a walking, talking billboard, meeting like-minded people.
[02:08:24.874 --> 02:08:29.755]  You wear an InfoWars.com t-shirt out in public, you're going to meet a lot of like-minded people.
[02:08:30.896 --> 02:08:32.836]  Here's one of the newest shirts that just came in.
[02:08:34.372 --> 02:08:35.552]  Defend Freedom.
[02:08:36.192 --> 02:08:37.993]  Join the Resistance.

[02:08:50.035 --> 02:08:52.636]  And we've added so many other shirts I haven't even shown you here on air.
[02:08:52.936 --> 02:08:54.936]  Now here's my favorite of the new shirts that came in.
[02:08:54.956 --> 02:08:58.097]  It's like a high school workout jersey.

[02:09:00.677 --> 02:09:01.838]  Infowars.com.
[02:09:02.398 --> 02:09:03.438]  Awesome, simple shirt.

[02:09:05.893 --> 02:09:11.260]  Infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:09:12.021 --> 02:09:13.483]  Don't forget films like Endgame.

[02:09:19.611 --> 02:09:20.512]  Shadow government.

[02:09:30.876 --> 02:09:45.623]  It's Kevin Booth's name, how we'd won the West, dealing with states' rights and the Feds coming in, but it's really about government drug dealing, Codex Alimentarius, the whole New World Order, and how they want to make vitamins and other things illegal, just like they've made marijuana illegal.

[02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:10.392]  It really is a powerful documentary film, obviously, I'm in it, and consulted on it.
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:20.644]  Okay, continuing with your phone calls, let's go ahead and talk to Daniel in New York.
[02:10:20.684 --> 02:10:21.584]  You're on the air, Daniel.
[02:10:22.805 --> 02:10:23.865]  Hello, Alex.
[02:10:24.105 --> 02:10:26.786]  I just want a quick comment and two questions.
[02:10:28.047 --> 02:10:30.888]  I've been a subscriber of yours for two years since you woke me up.
[02:10:31.709 --> 02:10:38.472]  Starting next spring, I'll be starting one of the country's top law schools, and I just want to let you know that when I get through the bar,
[02:10:39.575 --> 02:10:44.798]  If you ever need any pro bono legal research or representation, please don't hesitate to let me know.
[02:10:45.198 --> 02:10:46.099]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:10:46.839 --> 02:11:02.668]  And second, one of my questions is, I heard Jason Bermas speaking about the Internet 2 and how the Internet, as we know, is to be... Absorbed.
[02:11:03.248 --> 02:11:03.749]  Exactly.
[02:11:03.949 --> 02:11:07.811]  So my question is, what measures can we take to
[02:11:09.287 --> 02:11:12.523]  Uh, keep some freedom.
[02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:14.999]  Alive on the internet.
[02:11:15.019 --> 02:11:25.102]  I mean, do we need to... Make a big stink out of Microsoft and others helping China build their grid and Microsoft head and founder Gates saying censorship is good as he did a week ago.
[02:11:25.602 --> 02:11:30.964]  Make a big stink out of Australia openly not even allowing political discussion about candidates.
[02:11:31.004 --> 02:11:34.705]  I mean, that's mainstream news out of Australia today.
[02:11:35.705 --> 02:11:36.865]  That Italy's doing this.
[02:11:37.005 --> 02:11:39.146]  Say no to the end of net neutrality.
[02:11:39.646 --> 02:11:41.207]  Say no to internet too.
[02:11:43.147 --> 02:11:46.108]  My second question is, for those of us who are thinking of getting into gold,
[02:12:11.631 --> 02:12:20.913]  I know through Freedom Force International that there is a system, G-Bay, which works something like with virtual gold certificates.
[02:12:21.673 --> 02:12:30.154]  What system do you suggest whereby one can get off the fiat system without having to interface with it?
[02:12:30.174 --> 02:12:35.475]  Because in a sense, the power of gold is just the leverage it gives for the fiat system.
[02:12:36.556 --> 02:12:37.256]  Well, that's true.
[02:12:39.065 --> 02:12:42.247]  A lot of people get certificates and hold it in vaults in other countries.
[02:12:42.427 --> 02:12:43.827]  I wouldn't ever do that.
[02:12:45.288 --> 02:12:46.029]  I would hedge it.
[02:12:46.509 --> 02:12:55.293]  You know, I would put it in a couple different safety deposit boxes, put it in family safety deposit box, because if they even try to come seize your stuff, they won't know.
[02:12:56.034 --> 02:12:57.834]  Bury it on the back 40 part of it.
[02:12:58.355 --> 02:12:59.876]  Keep a little bit in your safe at home.
[02:12:59.896 --> 02:13:02.537]  I mean, it's so portable.
[02:13:02.557 --> 02:13:05.118]  You know, silver's also good.
[02:13:05.158 --> 02:13:08.200]  And for me, it's a backup, because I know they're devaluing the currency.
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:11.981]  And I know it's gone from $260-something to $1,100.
[02:13:12.661 --> 02:13:13.861]  It's up $8 a day.
[02:13:14.301 --> 02:13:19.782]  It may fluctuate up and down, but over the long haul, all evidence shows it's only going up.
[02:13:20.983 --> 02:13:23.703]  But I wouldn't hold gold certificates.
[02:13:24.484 --> 02:13:28.004]  I mean, some people do that, and I think it's crazy.
[02:13:28.704 --> 02:13:29.605]  I think it's crazy.
[02:13:30.205 --> 02:13:32.065]  I mean, I would want to physically hold it.
[02:13:33.846 --> 02:13:35.286]  Possession's nine-tenths of the law.
[02:13:37.276 --> 02:13:38.297]  Does that answer your question?
[02:13:38.617 --> 02:13:39.057]  Yes, it does.
[02:13:39.157 --> 02:13:39.878]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:13:40.358 --> 02:13:40.638]  You bet.
[02:13:40.658 --> 02:13:41.279]  Thank you, Daniel.
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:49.144]  I mean, the government's announcing that they may take over everyone's 401Ks and pensions and then tax it and then pay it to you as a check.
[02:13:49.865 --> 02:13:53.867]  They're openly announcing they're not going to insure money markets.
[02:13:53.927 --> 02:14:00.092]  I mean, most of the money I've got in the bank is backup and for savings accounts for my kids and to run this office.
[02:14:01.149 --> 02:14:02.951]  We've got like six months of operating money.
[02:14:02.971 --> 02:14:08.215]  I mean, I hoard that cash, so if everything's shut down, we can still operate for a while.
[02:14:08.516 --> 02:14:11.278]  We have a mission here, and it's in a money market.
[02:14:11.398 --> 02:14:12.439]  I've got to go get it out of there.
[02:14:12.739 --> 02:14:14.681]  And it doesn't even get 2-3% a year.
[02:14:16.062 --> 02:14:20.566]  But the point is, it's there as liquid cash, and now they're saying that's not even protected.
[02:14:20.586 --> 02:14:22.688]  You know, to $100,000 by the FDIC.
[02:14:22.708 --> 02:14:22.929]  I mean, look.
[02:14:26.752 --> 02:14:30.535]  That was only a prelude what we saw in 2008-2009 with the banks.
[02:14:30.915 --> 02:14:31.635]  A prelude.
[02:14:32.716 --> 02:14:34.417]  People need to get out a paper.
[02:14:34.878 --> 02:14:35.538]  They're crazy.
[02:14:36.659 --> 02:14:39.461]  And Ted Anderson, by the way, is still running that deal today.
[02:14:39.481 --> 02:14:48.247]  A free $157 a year subscription, hard copy or digital, to the International Forecaster by Bob Chapman.
[02:14:48.287 --> 02:14:49.588]  Invaluable information.
[02:14:49.608 --> 02:14:51.709]  This is thick, like 40 pages thick usually.
[02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:53.491]  Sometimes it's even thicker, sometimes smaller.
[02:14:54.915 --> 02:14:59.527]  When you buy a frank, for what did he say, $257 I think?
[02:14:59.547 --> 02:15:00.329]  I'm going from memory.
[02:15:00.811 --> 02:15:01.874]  So basically that's like $103 gold.
[02:15:04.482 --> 02:15:05.062]  Yes, it was 159.
[02:15:05.463 --> 02:15:07.544]  It was 259 per franc.
[02:15:07.824 --> 02:15:12.928]  So when you take the 150 something out, it came out to the number of $103 per franc.
[02:15:13.668 --> 02:15:15.650]  I mean, that's gold at like $400 an ounce.
[02:15:15.690 --> 02:15:17.231]  That's how good that deal is right now.
[02:15:17.251 --> 02:15:17.291]  800-686-2237.
[02:15:17.311 --> 02:15:17.891]  800-686-2237.
[02:15:17.951 --> 02:15:18.772]  The brokers are there.
[02:15:18.792 --> 02:15:22.234]  You call up and say, I want that franc and I want the international forecaster.
[02:15:22.254 --> 02:15:22.295]  800-686-2237.
[02:15:31.821 --> 02:15:32.922]  Let's go, I gotta move quick now.
[02:15:33.183 --> 02:15:34.884]  Let's talk to Josh in California.
[02:15:34.924 --> 02:15:35.625]  Josh, go ahead.
[02:15:36.005 --> 02:15:36.866]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:15:36.886 --> 02:15:38.048]  I got two quick things for you.
[02:15:38.108 --> 02:15:43.293]  First of all, I'm wondering, are you aware of how the New World Order was presented at the Grammy Awards to the public?
[02:15:44.537 --> 02:15:45.697]  Beyonce did an act.
[02:15:46.018 --> 02:15:58.122]  She came out dressed in a miniskirt that looked like she was wearing body armor, followed by a full battalion of soldiers like the ones we saw in Pittsburgh, followed her on stage, stood there with arms folded while the whole audience cheered.
[02:15:58.402 --> 02:16:01.063]  You can go on YouTube, you can find that, it's very concerning.
[02:16:01.123 --> 02:16:01.783]  What's it called?
[02:16:02.684 --> 02:16:07.145]  Uh, just, uh, YouTube, uh, Beyonce Grammy 2010 performance.
[02:16:09.739 --> 02:16:24.996]  Look, the Pentagon admits, and the police departments admit, they're spending huge amounts of taxpayer money where they just glorify black ski masks, glorify troops on the streets, glorify, and so they're just pushing it as if it's glamorous.
[02:16:25.737 --> 02:16:34.281]  It's like the old Bill Hicks commercial, the ultimate advertisement is just a hot blonde, you know, basically in a sexual pose with a Coca-Cola between her legs.
[02:16:34.721 --> 02:16:38.343]  And, you know, people want that Coca-Cola, you know, because it's got a woman involved.
[02:16:38.643 --> 02:16:47.007]  And so you put a popular pop singer up and show this, and it's just like men in black scheme-ask-your-good beating people over the heads.
[02:16:47.647 --> 02:16:50.468]  And it's just part of the degradation of society.
[02:16:50.508 --> 02:16:54.370]  But no, I haven't seen that, but I've seen a lot of similar acclimation, Josh.
[02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:55.511]  Yeah, very scary.
[02:16:55.531 --> 02:16:57.432]  The other thing, Alex, is you've inspired me.
[02:16:57.852 --> 02:17:03.776]  In November, after hearing you enough times, I started a radio show, a friend and I. We've done 70 shows now.
[02:17:03.796 --> 02:17:04.656]  We're on every night.
[02:17:04.676 --> 02:17:05.897]  It's called First Contact.
[02:17:06.678 --> 02:17:08.819]  We talk about InfoWars all the time.
[02:17:08.839 --> 02:17:09.760]  We talk about you.
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:11.741]  We're turning them on to the New World Order.
[02:17:11.761 --> 02:17:13.202]  We're on two hours every night now.
[02:17:15.023 --> 02:17:20.186]  CosmicNewsNetwork.com, BlogTalkRadio.com, forward slash First Contact, 7 to 9 p.m.
[02:17:21.311 --> 02:17:22.072]  That's awesome, bro.
[02:17:22.092 --> 02:17:23.072]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:23.673 --> 02:17:27.375]  Okay, let's go ahead now and talk to Annette in Florida.
[02:17:27.395 --> 02:17:28.315]  Annette, we've got to move quick.
[02:17:28.355 --> 02:17:28.676]  Welcome.
[02:17:30.277 --> 02:17:30.517]  Thanks.
[02:17:31.197 --> 02:17:33.639]  Alex, thanks for your show and the opportunity to call in.
[02:17:33.679 --> 02:17:35.120]  I just really have a quick comment.
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:39.703]  You know how lately you've been speaking about the cyber surveillance?
[02:17:40.603 --> 02:17:41.764]  Well, I have a new website.
[02:17:42.124 --> 02:17:48.008]  It's hatredgal.com and it's so new that I'm still constantly checking the statistics and everything.
[02:17:48.895 --> 02:17:56.758]  And I just happened to have a visit, already two times, from a company out of Washington D.C., Cyvalence.
[02:17:56.838 --> 02:17:57.539]  Have you heard of them?
[02:17:58.299 --> 02:18:01.960]  You know, your phone is cutting out so bad, I didn't really hear that.
[02:18:02.141 --> 02:18:03.261]  What's the name of the company?
[02:18:04.662 --> 02:18:05.462]  Cyvalence.
[02:18:06.681 --> 02:18:09.703]  C-Y-V-E-I-L-L-N-C-E?
[02:18:10.143 --> 02:18:12.765]  No, but I mean, you ought to see InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:18:13.225 --> 02:18:17.748]  Tens of thousands of government visits every single day.
[02:18:17.768 --> 02:18:25.592]  I mean, it's just everywhere, with every government agency on the planet visiting InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:18:25.612 --> 02:18:28.714]  They're very interested in what we're doing, and there's PSYOP.
[02:18:29.094 --> 02:18:33.897]  But for those that just joined us, we are showing the video of the Storm Trooper police
[02:18:34.377 --> 02:18:35.678]  If I were a boy, I think I could understand
[02:19:10.609 --> 02:19:11.810]  Then she grabs her crotch.
[02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:16.595]  I mean, this is literally worshipping tyranny, worshipping degradation.
[02:19:16.895 --> 02:19:18.076]  I mean, this is like a... 1984.
[02:19:21.451 --> 02:19:26.975]  Or some nightmare futuristic... It's like Nazi... Is she doing like Nazi salutes?
[02:19:27.816 --> 02:19:31.979]  I mean, they're really getting us ready to worship the police running around slaughtering us.
[02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:39.685]  Hey cops, keep drinking the sodium fluoride, keep eating the... ...smart stacked Monsanto food.
[02:19:41.226 --> 02:19:43.728]  All you people that are serving the evil, just enjoy it!
[02:19:44.529 --> 02:19:47.291]  You're gonna get just what Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany got.
[02:19:49.551 --> 02:19:58.309]  What they're saying in this is, tyranny is beautiful, black ski masks are beautiful, by juxtaposing this beautiful woman next to it.
[02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:59.892]  This is the death of America.
[02:20:01.385 --> 02:20:07.710]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:14.195]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:20:14.475 --> 02:20:20.460]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:25.722]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:20:26.182 --> 02:20:34.024]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:20:34.365 --> 02:20:38.446]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[02:20:38.946 --> 02:20:43.270]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:49.175]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[02:20:49.355 --> 02:20:52.098]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[02:20:52.398 --> 02:20:53.059]  Or by calling 269-409-1776.

[02:21:01.861 --> 02:21:05.507]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:05.888 --> 02:21:08.893]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.113 --> 02:21:10.536]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:21:11.235 --> 02:21:13.898]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:13.918 --> 02:21:20.184]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.324 --> 02:21:25.348]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:25.509 --> 02:21:35.498]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:35.598 --> 02:21:36.239]  Tim Geithner?
[02:21:36.459 --> 02:21:36.919]  Bernanke?
[02:21:36.939 --> 02:21:37.700]  They're arsonists!
[02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:39.281]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:39.541 --> 02:21:41.823]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.003 --> 02:21:43.825]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:43.845 --> 02:21:48.909]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:49.269 --> 02:21:54.053]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:54.294 --> 02:21:58.397]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:00.242 --> 02:22:02.344]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.584 --> 02:22:02.965]  February 2nd, 2010.
[02:22:03.005 --> 02:22:03.926]  Gold opened this morning at $11.1270.
[02:22:03.966 --> 02:22:07.649]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.4311, $5.7156 for a half-ounce, or $2.8578 for the quarter-ounce.
[02:22:07.669 --> 02:22:07.990]  That's $11.4311, $5.7156, and $2.8578.
[02:22:19.807 --> 02:22:30.156]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:22:30.276 --> 02:22:33.419]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:22:33.499 --> 02:22:36.841]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:22:36.902 --> 02:22:39.644]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:22:39.864 --> 02:22:42.565]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:22:42.625 --> 02:22:45.387]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:45.587 --> 02:22:47.748]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[02:22:47.888 --> 02:22:48.588]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.248 --> 02:22:54.471]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:54.491 --> 02:22:54.671]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.533 --> 02:23:04.695]  Americans have heard much about change in recent times and are now waking up to the truth.
[02:23:04.935 --> 02:23:07.936]  Well, here's a few facts about your food you may want to change.
[02:23:08.096 --> 02:23:15.699]  Did you know that nearly 100% of the food on store shelves comes from a few corporations and that most is genetically engineered, chemically sprayed, and
[02:23:15.779 --> 02:23:16.460]  We're good to go.
[02:23:32.159 --> 02:23:40.223]  Homeowners and homesteaders know Baker Creek offers some of the most popular seed collection kits, like our Large Heirloom Kit with 60 full-size seed packets for only $99.
[02:23:41.404 --> 02:23:46.686]  The kit contains 25 types of vegetables and comes packaged in a metal can for long-term storage for just $99.
[02:23:47.587 --> 02:23:51.069]  Look for our free catalog today at rareseeds.com.
[02:23:51.169 --> 02:23:53.630]  That's rareseeds.com or call 1-866-OLD-SEED.
[02:23:53.650 --> 02:23:54.650]  That's 1-866-653-7333 today!
[02:24:07.541 --> 02:24:13.625]  Okay, I want to shift gears now into news coming up and financial news.
[02:24:15.786 --> 02:24:27.473]  But first, I want to play four short radio clips and analyze them from a YouTube channel, a listener of ours, Funkmaster5 is the YouTube channel, and a lot of our listeners have been doing this.
[02:24:27.553 --> 02:24:33.337]  Mark Dice, you know, one of the more modern pioneers of this, who again, we woke up.
[02:24:33.697 --> 02:24:36.039]  It's like we woke up Gary Franchi and the list goes on and on.
[02:24:37.179 --> 02:24:46.066]  That's what I'm so proud of about this radio show is how many real bonafide leaders against tyranny we have spawned here with my films and the radio show.
[02:24:46.366 --> 02:24:55.893]  But people are swarming Savage, Hannity, Limbaugh, Beck, and really changing what they cover, making them admit world government.
[02:24:56.394 --> 02:24:57.475]  But you listen to Beck,
[02:24:58.584 --> 02:25:08.136]  He says he wants to drink gallons of fluoride and calls the guy a kook when it's on record that fluoride eats your brain, gives you bone cancer.
[02:25:08.677 --> 02:25:12.161]  Over 90% of the EPA scientists a few years ago sent a letter
[02:25:13.134 --> 02:25:14.595]  to the EPA saying, take it out.
[02:25:15.295 --> 02:25:22.400]  So I wanted to illustrate how three of the hosts try to call people kooks and stuff and make jokes, but Al Savage doesn't.
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:23.441]  So let's go ahead.
[02:25:23.481 --> 02:25:29.665]  I mean, listen to the craziness of a caller who calls in about fluoride and what Glenn Beck has to say to him.
[02:25:35.267 --> 02:25:36.628]  Thank you for taking my call, sir.
[02:25:36.668 --> 02:25:41.992]  This may seem extremely trivial considering everything that's going on, but it's something that I'm passionate about.
[02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:46.196]  I studied and looked at the effects of fluoride in our water.
[02:25:46.576 --> 02:25:51.240]  Now, the ADA and the government agencies would have us believe that it's good for our teeth.
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:55.223]  And with that being said, okay, if it's good for our teeth, that's understandable.
[02:25:55.703 --> 02:25:57.164]  Why put it into our water?
[02:25:57.545 --> 02:25:59.366]  We drink it.
[02:25:59.386 --> 02:26:01.648]  It goes into our body and it accumulates in our body.
[02:26:02.273 --> 02:26:09.039]  Drinking fluoride is the equivalent of drinking suntan lotion to prevent from getting a sunburn.
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:11.461]  I don't understand.
[02:26:11.521 --> 02:26:17.326]  If I could get one person in your audience to look up fluoride and to stop using fluoride, I'll be happy.
[02:26:17.426 --> 02:26:23.732]  If I could get you to investigate and look into fluoride and what it does and the effects of it, I would be ecstatic.
[02:26:24.653 --> 02:26:26.074]  I don't think I can make you ecstatic.
[02:26:27.748 --> 02:26:31.131]  I mean, I just don't think, I mean, good God, man, the world is on fire.
[02:26:31.151 --> 02:26:36.114]  You want me to stop and look why we're putting fluoride in our drinking water?
[02:26:36.134 --> 02:26:39.377]  I'm putting buckets of fluoride, man!
[02:26:39.397 --> 02:26:40.538]  Say that again?
[02:26:40.838 --> 02:26:47.783]  You put a straw in a bucket of fluoride, I'll be a happy little sippy cup all day if that's the worst thing we got going for us.
[02:26:48.607 --> 02:26:53.528]  It's not the worst thing we got going for us, but it's the equivalent of mass medication.
[02:26:53.548 --> 02:26:58.010]  And I know as you look into different government agencies over the years, do I think it's a conspiracy?
[02:26:58.050 --> 02:26:58.330]  No!
[02:26:58.610 --> 02:27:05.852]  I think it was big business that somewhere along the line discovered that they can get rid of what equates to a poison.
[02:27:06.172 --> 02:27:07.732]  It's not a natural organic.
[02:27:07.972 --> 02:27:14.774]  They use the fluoride from the aluminum industry and use that and disperse it into our water.
[02:27:15.447 --> 02:27:20.350]  Look, may I just quote, may I just quote, scientific consensus, 9 out of 10 dentists agree.
[02:27:22.832 --> 02:27:26.594]  Scientific consensus, just like global warming's a consensus.
[02:27:27.235 --> 02:27:35.660]  No, the American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth with fluoride, it gives them dental fluorosis, fractures the teeth and causes bone cancer.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.661]  That's a fact, it's not funny.
[02:27:38.122 --> 02:27:39.723]  But that's what Beck does on every subject.
[02:27:39.763 --> 02:27:41.064]  Now let's go to Sean Hannity.
[02:27:41.792 --> 02:27:45.114]  Being asked a question and listen to how he responds.
[02:27:45.174 --> 02:27:48.875]  A real issue is brought up and this is how Hannity responds.
[02:27:54.898 --> 02:27:55.939]  Hi, how's it going, Sean?
[02:27:56.079 --> 02:27:56.479]  I'm good, sir.
[02:27:56.499 --> 02:27:56.879]  How are you?
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:58.620]  I'm doing alright.
[02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:03.944]  I think you're a little off on the way Obama's handling the situation with Iran.
[02:28:04.804 --> 02:28:10.648]  I think particularly he's handling it good because he's keeping the gas prices down, which is what he wants to be doing right now.
[02:28:10.908 --> 02:28:13.109]  Well, he's not doing anything to keep the gas prices down.
[02:28:13.189 --> 02:28:16.211]  It went through 50 some odd consecutive days of going up.
[02:28:16.937 --> 02:28:23.001]  And if we see a price of a barrel of oil going up, up, up, up, up, and again, we're doing nothing to move towards independence.
[02:28:23.321 --> 02:28:36.850]  Well, if you look at it this way, I think the big driving force behind that is the fact that Mr. Obama, along with Bush and people like Rick Perry, attend the Bilderberg Conference where they plan to fix the prices of gas to get their objectives up.
[02:28:36.890 --> 02:28:38.371]  Alright, alright.
[02:28:38.592 --> 02:28:43.095]  I believe in conspiracies and I believe that hovering above the earth is a mother ship.
[02:28:46.957 --> 02:28:52.219]  Okay, so it came out that Bilderberg did decide in 2008 to jack it up to 150.
[02:28:52.599 --> 02:28:54.600]  We made the prediction from the info inside.
[02:28:54.620 --> 02:28:55.320]  It was proven right.
[02:28:56.441 --> 02:28:58.442]  And then separately, Lindsay Williams got the info.
[02:28:58.462 --> 02:28:58.942]  That happened.
[02:28:58.982 --> 02:29:00.002]  That was the call that happened.
[02:29:00.303 --> 02:29:04.164]  Bilderberg Group's real, but he equates it with a mothership.
[02:29:04.424 --> 02:29:05.285]  But not for long.
[02:29:05.325 --> 02:29:06.125]  Here's Bloomberg.
[02:29:07.125 --> 02:29:10.067]  Maybe a secret banking cabal does run the world after all.
[02:29:10.107 --> 02:29:15.469]  We have Ban Ki-moon, Herman Van Rompuy, Gordon Brown, Al Gore all calling for global government.
[02:29:16.295 --> 02:29:23.200]  And Hannity has guests on who tell him, like Dick Morris, that world government is here.
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:24.261]  I mean, it's being announced.
[02:29:24.321 --> 02:29:27.283]  It's on the Drudge Report almost every day, mainstream articles.
[02:29:27.983 --> 02:29:30.145]  And now the Drudge Report links to us in the permanent links.
[02:29:30.645 --> 02:29:31.886]  At least it's been like that for the last month.
[02:29:31.946 --> 02:29:32.266]  Check it.
[02:29:32.306 --> 02:29:33.047]  I can't believe it.
[02:29:33.387 --> 02:29:34.988]  I mean, you guys are the kooks.
[02:29:35.809 --> 02:29:38.991]  We're not talking about motherships hovering above.
[02:29:39.632 --> 02:29:39.892]  Okay?
[02:29:39.912 --> 02:29:41.333]  I mean, look at that tactic.
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:45.160]  Mothership's from Hannity.
[02:29:45.781 --> 02:29:47.621]  Beck wants to drink buckets of fluoride.
[02:29:47.681 --> 02:29:50.803]  Folks, if you ate a teaspoon of fluoride, it would kill you within an hour.
[02:29:50.823 --> 02:29:51.703]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.203 --> 02:29:53.804]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.724 --> 02:29:57.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:04.341]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.642 --> 02:30:05.262]  Number one.
[02:30:05.562 --> 02:30:08.723]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:08.983 --> 02:30:09.563]  Number two.
[02:30:09.843 --> 02:30:14.405]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:14.725 --> 02:30:15.185]  It's true.
[02:30:15.485 --> 02:30:20.027]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.347 --> 02:30:20.888]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.168 --> 02:30:24.470]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:24.751 --> 02:30:28.494]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:28.674 --> 02:30:28.934]  Number 4.
[02:30:29.475 --> 02:30:31.837]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.237 --> 02:30:35.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:36.120]  Number 5.
[02:30:36.701 --> 02:30:40.624]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:40.844 --> 02:30:45.608]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:45.888 --> 02:30:49.911]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.051 --> 02:30:51.632]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.852 --> 02:30:53.933]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:54.113 --> 02:30:57.295]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:02.178 --> 02:31:05.821]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:06.181 --> 02:31:09.223]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.443 --> 02:31:10.844]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:31:11.742 --> 02:31:14.203]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:14.223 --> 02:31:20.485]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.605 --> 02:31:25.647]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:26.147 --> 02:31:35.771]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:35.911 --> 02:31:38.013]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:38.253 --> 02:31:39.595]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:39.835 --> 02:31:42.117]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:42.297 --> 02:31:44.139]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:44.419 --> 02:31:49.264]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:49.584 --> 02:31:58.713]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:00.655 --> 02:32:04.978]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[02:32:05.158 --> 02:32:07.859]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:10.441]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[02:32:10.661 --> 02:32:17.525]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad-spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[02:32:17.705 --> 02:32:18.826]  What does this mean in the garden?
[02:32:18.886 --> 02:32:23.569]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength.
[02:32:23.729 --> 02:32:30.196]  Blue Ribbon Garden Produce, jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bricks wheatgrass.
[02:32:30.276 --> 02:32:33.319]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[02:32:33.459 --> 02:32:36.062]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[02:32:36.282 --> 02:32:43.270]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:48.212]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might just be the ultimate hard times barter item.
[02:32:48.472 --> 02:32:52.234]  To grow tastier fruits and vegetables right now, go to growlikecrazy.com.
[02:32:52.454 --> 02:32:54.515]  That's growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:32:54.535 --> 02:32:54.595]  877-327-0365.
[02:32:54.615 --> 02:33:04.859]  There are more than 60,000 people signed up at four different Facebook accounts that are fan Facebooks and we think they're great.
[02:33:13.533 --> 02:33:15.475]  But we've started our own official Facebook.
[02:33:15.976 --> 02:33:19.179]  It's facebook.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:21.381]  You want to go check it out?
[02:33:22.162 --> 02:33:28.249]  Facebook.com forward slash RealAlexJones and then twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:33:29.386 --> 02:33:32.627]  We send out photos in the office, articles, documents.
[02:33:32.868 --> 02:33:34.528]  We get your responses, your questions.
[02:33:34.568 --> 02:33:35.849]  You've heard me reading them here on air.
[02:33:36.329 --> 02:33:38.370]  Okay, so I'm just going through a few of these callers.
[02:33:38.430 --> 02:33:40.691]  On the Funkmaster5 channel, there's a lot more of this.
[02:33:41.311 --> 02:33:43.652]  Going through these talk show hosts.
[02:33:44.193 --> 02:33:48.434]  Caller calls in with serious info, says they're coordinating gas prices.
[02:33:48.474 --> 02:33:50.255]  I mean, there's been congressional hearings about that.
[02:33:50.295 --> 02:33:51.076]  Everybody knows that.
[02:33:51.656 --> 02:33:53.857]  And it's just, no, there's no mother ship above the earth.
[02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:57.513]  Uh, fluoride's really dangerous and they're forcibly medicating us.
[02:33:57.854 --> 02:33:59.776]  Oh, yes, I'd want to drink buckets of it.
[02:34:00.337 --> 02:34:01.859]  All the scientists agree it's good.
[02:34:02.460 --> 02:34:03.040]  No, they don't.
[02:34:03.982 --> 02:34:04.162]  So...
[02:34:05.273 --> 02:34:05.913]  It's just amazing.
[02:34:05.953 --> 02:34:07.014]  Now, here's Dennis Miller.
[02:34:07.494 --> 02:34:08.835]  He's even worse.
[02:34:08.855 --> 02:34:12.057]  I mean, this is the disdain he has for his audience.
[02:34:12.097 --> 02:34:12.598]  Here it is.
[02:34:12.838 --> 02:34:13.778]  This just happened a month ago.
[02:34:14.599 --> 02:34:22.344]  Thousands of news articles admitting world government from mainstream media and saying it's good, but when you call in and don't like it, Miller knows what to do.
[02:34:22.404 --> 02:34:25.206]  He says, listen, little slave, that isn't real.
[02:34:25.606 --> 02:34:26.346]  You're a kook.
[02:34:26.607 --> 02:34:27.067]  Here it is.
[02:34:28.848 --> 02:34:29.088]  Thanks.
[02:34:29.148 --> 02:34:30.269]  Keith in Texas, what's up?
[02:34:32.506 --> 02:34:34.447]  Hey Dennis, great show.
[02:34:34.667 --> 02:34:40.070]  I wanted to say first, I went to my first tea party on July 4th.
[02:34:40.171 --> 02:34:42.912]  I learned a lot of things there, it was really great.
[02:34:43.292 --> 02:34:53.138]  But I come out of it worried because, well, as a Texan here we have Rick Perry and he's running for governor against Kay Bailey Hutchinson.
[02:34:53.158 --> 02:34:55.980]  Some people say he's going to be running for president possibly.
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:35:05.027]  Um, the thing that bothers me is I saw a News 8 Austin local news here, newscast on YouTube about him attending the Bilderberg Conference.
[02:35:05.768 --> 02:35:08.290]  And that concerns me because he's, uh... Attended what?
[02:35:08.390 --> 02:35:11.233]  Attending that meeting which, um... Attending what?
[02:35:12.153 --> 02:35:14.736]  Which, which, uh, Kay Bailey Hutchinson attended.
[02:35:14.776 --> 02:35:15.696]  Wait a second, wait a second.
[02:35:15.736 --> 02:35:23.243]  I know I asked for no ketchup on the burger at the drive-thru and you're all thrown off, but just go back to the name of the... Did you say the...
[02:35:24.236 --> 02:35:25.917]  Wally Hildenberger Conference?
[02:35:25.957 --> 02:35:26.297]  What is it?
[02:35:26.337 --> 02:35:27.217]  Bilderberg Conference.
[02:35:27.337 --> 02:35:29.757]  B-I-L-B-E-R-B-E-R-G.
[02:35:29.837 --> 02:35:30.738]  Oh, that's creeping me out.
[02:35:30.778 --> 02:35:31.858]  I'm sorry, baby, I'm going to rock.
[02:35:32.238 --> 02:35:36.179]  I mean my bergs with an E-R-G at the end, as in Jimmy Cameron's Titanic.
[02:35:36.199 --> 02:35:39.920]  Why don't you start spelling it, otherwise I get conspiracy in the run of time right now.
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:41.480]  Yeah, Bilderberg.
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:42.981]  I think that is conspiracy.
[02:35:43.121 --> 02:35:44.101]  Yeah, it sounded conspiracy.
[02:35:44.121 --> 02:35:45.822]  You know, there's certain words, as soon as you hear them.
[02:35:45.842 --> 02:35:47.242]  When a guy says Bilderbergian,
[02:35:47.902 --> 02:35:51.023]  Now see, he told the listeners, you need to move on from this.
[02:35:51.043 --> 02:35:55.205]  This isn't real, this is a pile of cow poo, and it's an imaginary hamburger.
[02:35:55.225 --> 02:35:55.965]  This guy is insane.
[02:36:17.731 --> 02:36:24.614]  He calls in News 8 Austin, Dallas Morning News, all reported he went to Bilderberg, violated the Logan Act, it's in my film Endgame.
[02:36:24.634 --> 02:36:31.878]  Dennis Miller says everyone should just move on, no one should listen to that guy.
[02:36:31.958 --> 02:36:34.399]  He knows his job.
[02:36:35.559 --> 02:36:37.300]  He thinks he's part of this elite.
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:39.681]  He thinks it's funny to keep you in the dark.
[02:36:39.721 --> 02:36:40.782]  He thinks it's cute.
[02:36:41.742 --> 02:36:45.684]  Now, here's Michael Savage when he gets asked about
[02:36:46.943 --> 02:36:47.804]  Bohemian Grove.
[02:36:48.224 --> 02:36:49.785]  He doesn't back off from it.
[02:36:49.805 --> 02:36:55.368]  He talks about how it's disgusting and a bunch of old Republicans, naked men, wallowing on each other.
[02:36:56.149 --> 02:37:01.332]  So, here's Michael Savage, of the four, and I went through a bunch of others.
[02:37:01.352 --> 02:37:05.675]  He's the only one in the whole list of big-time talk show hosts who would address reality.
[02:37:06.275 --> 02:37:06.876]  Michael Savage.
[02:37:11.646 --> 02:37:15.089]  Yeah, um, Michael, I'm very concerned about our country.
[02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:19.333]  I just got done watching the Cremation of Terror video on YouTube.
[02:37:19.433 --> 02:37:23.696]  It talks about what they really, and it shows video evidence of what they do at the Bohemian Grove.
[02:37:23.756 --> 02:37:24.657]  All these guys are sick.
[02:37:24.677 --> 02:37:26.018]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:37:26.038 --> 02:37:30.361]  Now, you set me up with something or something, and you didn't want to really talk, you wanted to talk about the Bohemian Grove.
[02:37:30.802 --> 02:37:32.563]  So you're obsessed with the Bohemian Grove?
[02:37:33.904 --> 02:37:38.228]  Well, I mean, I saw video proof of what they do there, and you know... And so what is it you want America to do?
[02:37:38.268 --> 02:37:39.689]  Close down the Bohemian Grove?
[02:37:40.808 --> 02:37:47.252]  Well, I think they should start to be a little more open to the fact that a lot of these guys agree about most of the issues behind closed doors.
[02:37:47.272 --> 02:37:51.394]  They may act like they're opposed when, you know, they're in the public eye, but it's all an act.
[02:37:51.814 --> 02:37:53.195]  Who is in the Bohemian Grove?
[02:37:53.235 --> 02:37:54.776]  Are they Bohemians, or are they...?
[02:37:56.116 --> 02:38:02.860]  Well, you have guys like Schwarzenegger's been there, Bush, Newt Gingrich has gone there... How come I haven't been invited?
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:06.062]  I'd like to get naked in the woods with a bunch of fat old Republicans.
[02:38:06.102 --> 02:38:07.082]  Why am I not invited?
[02:38:10.156 --> 02:38:17.739]  I can think of no better vacation this August than to be invited to get naked and get down with some fat, naked Republicans like Newt Gingrich.
[02:38:18.099 --> 02:38:20.340]  What a great summer vacation that would be.
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:23.241]  What else do they do?
[02:38:23.261 --> 02:38:24.041]  They drink what?
[02:38:24.141 --> 02:38:24.842]  They drink blood?
[02:38:24.902 --> 02:38:26.142]  I mean, what else are you suggesting?
[02:38:26.302 --> 02:38:29.303]  Well, the interesting thing is there's a video on YouTube where you can see it.
[02:38:29.323 --> 02:38:31.944]  I mean, they show the whole little ceremony they do.
[02:38:32.024 --> 02:38:32.885]  Let's not go into it.
[02:38:32.905 --> 02:38:34.005]  I'm not interested in that part.
[02:38:34.025 --> 02:38:35.345]  Can we do this in a family way?
[02:38:35.385 --> 02:38:36.686]  What do they do there that upsets you?
[02:38:38.126 --> 02:38:42.329]  Well, they do a mock sacrifice in front of an owl statue.
[02:38:44.170 --> 02:38:44.790]  That's cute.
[02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:45.731]  That's almost innocent.
[02:38:46.131 --> 02:38:47.592]  And what is it that they sacrifice?
[02:38:48.072 --> 02:38:48.512]  Servitude.
[02:38:48.572 --> 02:38:50.253]  No, but what do they kill?
[02:38:51.854 --> 02:38:54.156]  Well, it's a mock sacrifice of a human being.
[02:38:54.216 --> 02:38:56.297]  It's like a dummy.
[02:38:56.537 --> 02:38:57.358]  A dummy?
[02:38:57.398 --> 02:38:59.719]  They use a crash dummy from an old test?
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:04.782]  That Schwarzenegger gets from one of the departments he has?
[02:39:05.102 --> 02:39:06.983]  They get a crash dummy and they sacrifice it?
[02:39:09.329 --> 02:39:10.009]  I don't think so.
[02:39:10.029 --> 02:39:14.571]  I mean, it has, uh, uh, origins in paganism and... Is there sex?
[02:39:14.611 --> 02:39:15.612]  Come on, let's get down to it.
[02:39:15.632 --> 02:39:17.973]  Is there wild sex in the woods while the wives are away?
[02:39:18.013 --> 02:39:18.873]  Is that what you're implying?
[02:39:19.853 --> 02:39:23.095]  The thought of it with Luke Gingrich is enough to make me puke.
[02:39:23.295 --> 02:39:25.676]  Savage.
[02:39:26.896 --> 02:39:27.797]  All right, folks.
[02:39:29.298 --> 02:39:31.199]  The point is, Savage lives in San Francisco.
[02:39:31.259 --> 02:39:32.120]  He knows when they're meeting.
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:33.860]  It's the end of July, August.
[02:39:34.001 --> 02:39:34.621]  He knows that.
[02:39:35.001 --> 02:39:38.843]  He just wants to... Savage can't stand not showing people that he knows about it.
[02:39:39.363 --> 02:39:41.364]  The other host would just say, flying saucers!
[02:39:41.825 --> 02:39:42.445]  Doesn't exist.
[02:39:42.505 --> 02:39:47.588]  Well, here is the film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death.
[02:39:47.728 --> 02:39:48.448]  Two films.
[02:39:49.289 --> 02:39:50.729]  The 2000 infiltration.
[02:39:53.791 --> 02:39:55.132]  The other fellow that infiltrated.
[02:39:57.268 --> 02:40:01.309]  In 2003, and they set him up and sent him to prison for it.
[02:40:02.149 --> 02:40:05.210]  That is all in here, what Mark Jones, I'm trying to remember his name.
[02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:06.791]  Poor guy, he should be getting out soon.
[02:40:07.171 --> 02:40:09.051]  The point is, the order of death.
[02:40:10.452 --> 02:40:13.393]  Our entire society is ruled and controlled by deep occultists.
[02:40:13.433 --> 02:40:14.413]  Director Alex Jones.
[02:40:15.433 --> 02:40:16.974]  Two films on one DVD.
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:20.341]  Infowars.com.
[02:40:20.581 --> 02:40:21.641]  Everybody should see this.
[02:40:21.701 --> 02:40:22.741]  Churches should see this.
[02:40:23.162 --> 02:40:31.865]  People should know what's really going on inside this facility, and how the two Bushes attended, and the things that go on there.
[02:40:32.605 --> 02:40:39.688]  Because the entire illusion of who they are and what they are is shattered by these two documentary films.
[02:40:39.808 --> 02:40:42.729]  One's an hour and a half long, the other's 46 minutes long.
[02:40:43.969 --> 02:40:45.950]  Two films, one DVD,
[02:40:47.475 --> 02:40:49.336]  Dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:40:49.356 --> 02:40:50.337]  You want to wake people up?
[02:40:50.757 --> 02:40:52.978]  This will wake up Christians, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:53.718 --> 02:40:55.820]  This will wake them up to their Republican Party.
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:02.643]  This is like holy water or a wooden stake to Count Dracula.
[02:41:05.585 --> 02:41:07.706]  Oh man, there is so much going on.
[02:41:07.746 --> 02:41:09.007]  There is so much happening.
[02:41:11.788 --> 02:41:12.489]  You know, I did
[02:41:13.683 --> 02:41:17.285]  Probably six hours this weekend of research, Friday, Saturday night.
[02:41:18.205 --> 02:41:38.336]  For some reason, I hadn't really studied what Monsanto was up to in about a year, and I knew how wicked this company was and all the evil things they've been involved in, from dioxin dumps in major cities like Anniston, Alabama, to knowing Agent Orange was going to kill people, and all of those reports, to the GMO food!
[02:41:39.523 --> 02:41:52.935]  And I knew that in their own studies, and in countless studies I've seen over the years, that the different corn varieties that produce their own pesticide, the corn grows its own pesticide so bugs won't eat it.
[02:41:54.036 --> 02:42:03.144]  And the German studies about this BT corn variety, bees will still get the pollen and they go and die, and that's reportedly one of the big reasons they're dying.
[02:42:04.713 --> 02:42:09.755]  And so I ended up spending three hours one night, three hours another night, and my wife's like, don't you ever stop?
[02:42:10.896 --> 02:42:13.076]  Just reading and reading and reading and reading.
[02:42:13.096 --> 02:42:17.218]  And then I get up here on air, how do you present six hours of research in just a few minutes?
[02:42:17.298 --> 02:42:22.580]  But I'm gonna get some guests back on about this because Monsanto is exploding.
[02:42:23.141 --> 02:42:26.042]  It was ruled Corporation of the Year by Forbes.
[02:42:28.564 --> 02:42:35.570]  They are over 70% of all GMO crops and they're doing sugar beets and just everything else now.
[02:42:35.610 --> 02:42:40.614]  I mean, they're now rolling out aggressively every major crop there is.
[02:42:41.515 --> 02:42:46.539]  And they're like, look, you can spray weed killer on this and our plant doesn't die.
[02:42:47.981 --> 02:42:48.801]  But it absorbs it.
[02:42:50.263 --> 02:42:55.067]  And no bugs can eat it because we've engineered pesticides into it.
[02:42:56.095 --> 02:43:06.209]  And then all these prestigious universities and facilities test it, and they feed it to rats, and they get liver failure and kidney failure and die en masse.
[02:43:06.269 --> 02:43:11.136]  And other companies with their potatoes and rice and... In fact, I meant to print this.
[02:43:11.176 --> 02:43:12.057]  I didn't print it for some reason.
[02:43:13.536 --> 02:43:14.597]  It was, uh, L.A.
[02:43:14.637 --> 02:43:16.299]  Times was the first one I saw a few years ago.
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:17.620]  U.N.
[02:43:18.181 --> 02:43:19.622]  Well, the U.N.
[02:43:19.742 --> 02:43:24.627]  is now looking at shipping rice to the third world that sterilizes men.
[02:43:25.448 --> 02:43:34.356]  But if I remember the exact headline, it was, um, GMO rice contraceptive for men.
[02:43:35.618 --> 02:43:36.158]  Give me that.
[02:43:36.278 --> 02:43:37.780]  But the point is, is that that's what
[02:43:39.244 --> 02:43:45.965]  These major Monsanto crops, in every study, sterilize or reduce fertility in the mice, in the guinea pigs.
[02:43:47.886 --> 02:43:50.066]  And so, it just so happens to do that too.
[02:43:50.466 --> 02:44:05.609]  But separately, other companies have got these systems right out in the open, and they're saying, we're going to make you eat this, and birth weights are down, sperm count's down by over 85%, infertility's off the charts, all these different
[02:44:06.363 --> 02:44:11.949]  Disorders of the intestines, autoimmune responses, definitely linked to vaccines and GMO crops.
[02:44:12.690 --> 02:44:15.793]  And then I was reading all the new crops they've got coming out.
[02:44:16.995 --> 02:44:20.699]  And I would go to the patent office and read what it does.
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:26.885]  Here's one from July 20th last year, but now this is being planted all over the U.S.
[02:44:28.413 --> 02:44:34.539]  Monsanto Dow Chemical went approval for modified corn, and now it's rolling out nationwide.
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:46.392]  SmartStax corn, and it says here that it has eight genetic traits in it, six of them pesticide that kills different bugs.
[02:44:46.432 --> 02:44:49.915]  Now listen, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I have all the studies.
[02:44:52.938 --> 02:44:58.104]  You start eating six pesticides that are grown in the corn so bugs can't eat it.
[02:44:58.565 --> 02:44:59.946]  Bugs can't eat it.
[02:44:59.966 --> 02:45:07.515]  You know, you don't go to the cupboard and pull out Raid and go, oh my God, well, you know, it kills bugs, but it doesn't hurt me.
[02:45:07.575 --> 02:45:08.316]  It's corn.
[02:45:08.336 --> 02:45:09.758]  A can of poison.
[02:45:10.759 --> 02:45:11.720]  Oh, you know, it's corn.
[02:45:12.691 --> 02:45:18.154]  I mean, it's not hard, but the way they twist it is they say, well, it's a naturally occurring pesticide.
[02:45:18.414 --> 02:45:26.878]  Yeah, that thousands of times lower concentrations of fungus that's poisonous tends to grow on corn that sometimes happens to keep bugs from eating it.
[02:45:27.539 --> 02:45:33.762]  But you don't make it 1,000 to 5,000, depending on the variety, stronger in the corn, and then we're eating it.
[02:45:35.538 --> 02:45:36.078]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:45:36.138 --> 02:45:41.521]  Cops can dress up in black uniforms and, you know, be at the Grammys or the Emmys or whatever.
[02:45:42.102 --> 02:45:43.362]  Go back to that video again.
[02:45:48.405 --> 02:45:49.446]  I guess this was the Grammys.
[02:45:51.747 --> 02:45:57.510]  And worshipping police in black uniforms stomping around on stage with the beautiful woman.
[02:45:58.390 --> 02:46:01.211]  I mean, it's just, hey, let me ask the cops something.
[02:46:01.431 --> 02:46:03.771]  Do you like being sterilized?
[02:46:03.811 --> 02:46:05.512]  Do you like being fed poison?
[02:46:06.092 --> 02:46:06.692]  Well, you don't care.
[02:46:06.752 --> 02:46:07.472]  Like, I feel powerful.
[02:46:07.512 --> 02:46:08.352]  They gave me a black uniform.
[02:46:10.133 --> 02:46:11.753]  See, I mean, we're all in this together.
[02:46:11.813 --> 02:46:13.794]  The elite are attacking all of us.
[02:46:14.454 --> 02:46:16.794]  And it's so stupid that we're even fighting with each other.
[02:46:19.595 --> 02:46:21.055]  But I was reading about the corn.
[02:46:22.656 --> 02:46:24.296]  What's the problem with smart stacks?
[02:46:27.173 --> 02:46:30.176]  And it has the Canadian government's refusal to even allow it.
[02:46:30.196 --> 02:46:33.819]  You know, the thing is, the rest of the world won't allow this stuff, but the U.S., oh, yes.
[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:37.683]  And you want bovine growth hormones, synthetic.
[02:46:37.723 --> 02:46:40.925]  Wonder why our girls are eight feet tall or whatever, you know.
[02:46:42.067 --> 02:46:45.089]  You wonder why six-year-old girls are going into puberty.
[02:46:45.690 --> 02:46:52.216]  And when they go to the doctor and they say, oh, you're full of hormones from all the food and stuff, we'll give you other hormones to suppress that.
[02:46:52.276 --> 02:46:53.457]  They don't tell you to stop eating it.
[02:46:55.643 --> 02:47:05.432]  SmartStax is a genetically engineered GE or genetically modified corn that is unique because it has eight GE, genetic engineered traits, combined or stacked together.
[02:47:06.052 --> 02:47:08.314]  It's down here, in this area of the article.
[02:47:08.334 --> 02:47:13.199]  If you're giving a document shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, this is the area right here.
[02:47:16.599 --> 02:47:31.403]  SmartStack is a genetically engineered GE or genetically modified GM corn that is unique because it has eight GE trades combined or stacked together, six for insect resistance, BT, and two for herbicide tolerance.
[02:47:32.443 --> 02:47:38.025]  There are some stacked GE trade crops in the market already, but these have only three traits each.
[02:47:43.021 --> 02:47:50.803]  And it says it will be the largest commercial launch of GE corn because it will replace a lot of existing GE corn on the market.
[02:47:51.423 --> 02:47:57.124]  And then I went to the Patent Office, I went to Bloomberg, I read all the information about it.
[02:47:57.484 --> 02:48:11.807]  Meanwhile, every time I mention the fact that the UN has built giant seed vaults, and when you read it's the Rockefeller, Rothschilds, and others are funding it,
[02:48:12.822 --> 02:48:14.883]  It's AP, Reuters, BBC.
[02:48:15.203 --> 02:48:17.603]  People send me emails saying that's not happening, that doesn't exist.
[02:48:18.183 --> 02:48:20.064]  Did you guys ever find the spermicide corn?
[02:48:23.385 --> 02:48:24.065]  It's everywhere.
[02:48:24.405 --> 02:48:25.245]  Hell, I'll do it right now.
[02:48:25.485 --> 02:48:28.886]  I'm not saying you guys can't find it, but let me try.
[02:48:33.427 --> 02:48:38.248]  New rice contraceptive for men.
[02:48:39.749 --> 02:48:41.549]  They call it a contraceptive instead of a sterilant.
[02:48:43.712 --> 02:48:52.578]  New Rice Contraceptive for Men.
[02:48:52.598 --> 02:48:56.281]  Oh, I didn't put a space.
[02:48:59.623 --> 02:49:00.944]  I'm obsessed with information.
[02:49:04.607 --> 02:49:06.948]  The Contraceptive Skin Patch Rice.
[02:49:09.010 --> 02:49:11.852]  Modified Sequence Counterceptive.
[02:49:13.100 --> 02:49:14.060]  This is driving me crazy.
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:16.061]  I ran into this everywhere without even looking for it.
[02:49:17.601 --> 02:49:18.281]  Eh, it doesn't matter.
[02:49:18.321 --> 02:49:18.702]  It's there.
[02:49:20.822 --> 02:49:21.422]  Try this.
[02:49:21.782 --> 02:49:24.063]  Try UN Seed Vault.
[02:49:26.184 --> 02:49:27.244]  UN Seed Vault.
[02:49:27.264 --> 02:49:29.945]  They've got them all over the world, but it'll show you the Arctic one.
[02:49:29.965 --> 02:49:30.705]  Do that real fast.
[02:49:31.465 --> 02:49:32.305]  UN Seed Vault.
[02:49:32.325 --> 02:49:34.266]  We'll show people that because they don't believe it's real.
[02:49:36.106 --> 02:49:38.307]  You found one about corn that sterilizes people?
[02:49:40.248 --> 02:49:41.149]  Print it for me then, Bubba.
[02:49:41.829 --> 02:49:43.250]  It's always worse than we even thought.
[02:49:45.131 --> 02:49:48.033]  Somebody on Twitter, find it and send it to our Twitter account.
[02:49:48.834 --> 02:49:49.874]  We can all work together.
[02:49:50.635 --> 02:49:52.016]  If we work together.
[02:49:52.036 --> 02:49:54.677]  There it is.
[02:49:55.078 --> 02:49:58.000]  It says, Spermicides and Genetically Modified Crops.
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:49:58.540]  There you go.
[02:49:59.100 --> 02:49:59.901]  But that's a blog.
[02:49:59.941 --> 02:50:01.582]  Let's scroll down and see what their source is.
[02:50:03.883 --> 02:50:04.564]  What is the source?
[02:50:04.604 --> 02:50:06.885]  What is the linky on there?
[02:50:06.905 --> 02:50:07.786]  It should have a linky.
[02:50:09.878 --> 02:50:10.699]  That says from.
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:13.461]  See that pink link right there?
[02:50:14.361 --> 02:50:18.464]  That'll tell you where it came from.
[02:50:19.005 --> 02:50:22.267]  The point is, folks, you better investigate this.
[02:50:24.829 --> 02:50:27.051]  You need to look into this for yourself.
[02:50:27.831 --> 02:50:29.673]  You need to understand this is going on.
[02:50:29.733 --> 02:50:31.134]  You need to understand this is real.
[02:50:32.475 --> 02:50:39.060]  I mean, there is so much happening and the general public is just totally unaware of what is happening.
[02:50:40.236 --> 02:50:41.558]  When we come back, we'll show you the U.N.
[02:50:41.598 --> 02:50:42.099]  Seed Vault.
[02:50:42.659 --> 02:50:43.340]  You can pick anything.
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:43.981]  BBC.
[02:50:44.221 --> 02:50:46.324]  In fact, I sent you guys a video over the weekend.
[02:50:46.725 --> 02:50:48.327]  You guys have the video of the U.N.
[02:50:48.367 --> 02:50:49.849]  tour of the Seed Vault?
[02:50:50.850 --> 02:50:51.772]  At the Arctic Circle?
[02:50:53.654 --> 02:50:54.135]  We haven't.
[02:50:54.315 --> 02:50:55.176]  So we'll play it tomorrow.
[02:50:55.196 --> 02:50:55.877]  We're almost out of time.
[02:50:55.937 --> 02:50:56.318]  Stay with us.
[02:51:00.242 --> 02:51:03.444]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:51:03.804 --> 02:51:05.645]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:51:06.106 --> 02:51:06.526]  Don't!
[02:51:06.966 --> 02:51:09.988]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:51:10.408 --> 02:51:17.533]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:51:17.513 --> 02:51:19.174]  's number one debt secret.
[02:51:19.494 --> 02:51:23.196]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:51:23.576 --> 02:51:26.278]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:51:26.698 --> 02:51:33.747]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:51:34.068 --> 02:51:35.069]  Herb K was right.
[02:51:35.270 --> 02:51:38.334]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:51:38.454 --> 02:51:39.455]  What have you got to lose?
[02:51:39.816 --> 02:51:42.940]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money!
[02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:46.581]  Get Herb K's number one death secret absolutely free now!
[02:51:46.821 --> 02:51:47.201]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:51:47.461 --> 02:51:47.861]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:51:47.881 --> 02:51:47.981]  888-352-7726.
[02:51:48.041 --> 02:51:51.262]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:51.882 --> 02:51:54.023]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:54.043 --> 02:51:56.323]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:10.825 --> 02:52:13.506]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.267 --> 02:52:19.729]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:19.890 --> 02:52:24.932]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.072 --> 02:52:35.057]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:35.177 --> 02:52:37.298]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:37.538 --> 02:52:38.859]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.119 --> 02:52:41.380]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:41.580 --> 02:52:43.420]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:43.701 --> 02:52:48.523]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:48.843 --> 02:52:53.625]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:53.865 --> 02:52:57.947]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:00.549 --> 02:53:04.553]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:53:04.833 --> 02:53:07.676]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:53:08.097 --> 02:53:14.744]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy.
[02:53:15.104 --> 02:53:19.889]  If we, the people, do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost
[02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:20.249]  I'm good.
[02:53:37.367 --> 02:53:37.727]  We're good.
[02:54:01.573 --> 02:54:11.138]  Huddled on the side of a frozen arctic mountain, the men and women who've built what's being called the world's doomsday vault, herald its imminent opening.
[02:54:12.698 --> 02:54:20.502]  Surrounded by miles and miles of icy wilderness, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault has been built to withstand nearly every catastrophe.
[02:54:21.102 --> 02:54:26.185]  Its precious contents, millions of seeds which could prove indispensable to our survival.
[02:54:28.052 --> 02:54:30.495]  The vault is secure against flooding.
[02:54:30.796 --> 02:54:34.380]  We're well above sea level if the ice on the poles should melt.
[02:54:35.481 --> 02:54:39.686]  It's safe against earthquakes.
[02:54:39.766 --> 02:54:43.751]  We're 130 meters inside the mountain, so we should be very safe.
[02:54:49.847 --> 02:55:00.594]  The point is, the UN, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and they talk about it in the article, are funding all these seed vaults while they buy up all the regular natural seeds and won't sell them to anybody.
[02:55:00.634 --> 02:55:01.855]  Monsanto's doing that.
[02:55:02.315 --> 02:55:11.261]  And then selling all these GMO crops that in every case we research it, hurts your fertility or sterilizes you and causes liver failure.
[02:55:12.042 --> 02:55:13.242]  Attacks the entire body.
[02:55:13.623 --> 02:55:16.184]  It just really devastates the liver because it deals with toxins.
[02:55:17.185 --> 02:55:18.486]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:55:20.077 --> 02:55:27.650]  We're living in a science fiction nightmare and we better get the general public and the enforcers to realize they're all under attack by this.
[02:55:28.492 --> 02:55:31.938]  Now I want to close out the show having Ted Anderson on for the last three minutes because Ted...
[02:55:32.850 --> 02:55:34.111]  Huge response yesterday.
[02:55:34.691 --> 02:55:41.734]  Obviously, people wanting the, what is it, $157 value of free year subscription, hard copy or digital.
[02:55:42.454 --> 02:55:43.535]  Comes out twice a week.
[02:55:44.275 --> 02:55:50.318]  Of the International Forecaster, which is 30, 40, 50, 60 pages, depending on what issue, from Bob Chapman.
[02:55:50.398 --> 02:55:51.538]  Really key info.
[02:55:52.119 --> 02:55:54.100]  A lot of it are stories from InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:54.660]  That's part of it.
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:58.882]  You're offering that free when people get a frank for $259.
[02:55:58.942 --> 02:55:59.542]  If you do the math,
[02:56:01.803 --> 02:56:08.126]  Whenever we did it yesterday, that comes out to $103 per franc.
[02:56:08.486 --> 02:56:14.029]  So that's gold at basically $400 an ounce, with an $1,100 and something today.
[02:56:14.069 --> 02:56:17.271]  What, it's up like eight, nine bucks last time I checked five minutes ago, Ted?
[02:56:18.031 --> 02:56:19.552]  Yeah, gold is up again today.
[02:56:19.852 --> 02:56:26.015]  And actually, the francs, even on my internet sites now, are up over $260 apiece.
[02:56:26.035 --> 02:56:30.377]  So this is a special that is clearly exclusive to this show right now, Alex.
[02:56:31.106 --> 02:56:33.712]  Just due to the fact that the market has gone up as much as it has.
[02:56:34.301 --> 02:56:36.262]  Today, gold has seen a high of $1,119.
[02:56:36.542 --> 02:56:38.942]  The dollar is dropping again.
[02:56:39.003 --> 02:56:40.003]  That's why it's happening.
[02:56:40.023 --> 02:56:54.027]  This little rally that we had just after the Christmas New Year's break seems to be breaking after the Obama announcement that there's going to be a $1.56 trillion deficit with his new stimulus package.
[02:56:54.047 --> 02:57:01.149]  So you bought gold at the $1,070 level and you're selling it at an even lower price than it was then when the market is $11,000.
[02:57:03.270 --> 02:57:03.871]  What is it, $11,000 what?
[02:57:03.911 --> 02:57:04.131]  Today, $1,119.
[02:57:04.191 --> 02:57:10.036]  So that's a super deal, and you get, no doubt, the Franks are the best deal, and you get a free international forecaster for a year.
[02:57:10.076 --> 02:57:12.719]  Yeah, a full subscription for a year, which is $159.
[02:57:12.779 --> 02:57:15.401]  And actually, with the Frank being at $255.36, it's about $98 per
[02:57:29.153 --> 02:57:31.475]  I'm just guesstimating here live on air.
[02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:53.773]  Yeah, it is just a fabulous deal, but the thing about it is you need to be informed.
[02:57:53.813 --> 02:57:56.195]  The International Forecaster is a great way to do that.
[02:57:56.655 --> 02:58:01.459]  And all you've got to do is call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:05.203]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:58:05.343 --> 02:58:07.745]  Alex, I don't think I can make a sweeter deal than this.
[02:58:08.245 --> 02:58:09.706]  How long can you offer this deal?
[02:58:09.726 --> 02:58:12.569]  We're going to offer it until tonight because the prices have gone up.
[02:58:12.689 --> 02:58:13.570]  They've already gone up.
[02:58:13.830 --> 02:58:14.791]  We'll see about tomorrow.
[02:58:15.111 --> 02:58:15.771]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:15.791 --> 02:58:17.453]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:17.553 --> 02:58:21.535]  I believe in gold.
[02:58:21.715 --> 02:58:22.796]  I believe in firearms.
[02:58:23.216 --> 02:58:24.537]  I believe in God and guts.
[02:58:24.737 --> 02:58:26.559]  God, guns, guts, gold.
[02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:31.562]  Again, 800-686-2237.
[02:58:31.582 --> 02:58:32.102]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:33.423 --> 02:58:38.687]  Retransmission, jam-packed broadcast coming up now on InfoWars.com and on the free podcast.
[02:58:38.927 --> 02:58:39.727]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:40.688 --> 02:58:44.991]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over
[02:58:50.888 --> 02:58:53.495]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:53.896 --> 02:58:54.638]  If you're going into a
