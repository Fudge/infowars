[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:06.113]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.113 --> 00:00:07.894]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:09.655]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:11.236]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:12.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:16.979]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.042]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.913]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have three guests popping in on the broadcast today.
[00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:34.975]  It is Friday, April 16, 2010.
[00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:46.102]  We're going to have wide open phones for your reports from the Tea Parties across the United States.
[00:00:46.102 --> 00:00:57.711]  We're going to break down the agent provocateurs and what they tried to do in cities across this land, trying to demonize the Tea Parties as racist and hateful.
[00:00:59.144 --> 00:01:05.989]  That, of course, is now starting to backfire on them, and we're going to go over all of the important news.
[00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:13.775]  In fact, here's just one story out of the New Mexico Independent.com news site.
[00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:33.041]  And they have the photos there and video of the Democrats that showed up at this particular event in front of the news, acting like they were with the Tea Parties, saying, Nazi youth for lower taxes, with swastikas.
[00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:38.903]  See, if you don't believe in man-made global warming, you're going to be called a Nazi.
[00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:46.797]  If you don't want the government going bankrupt and selling us out to foreign banks, you're a Nazi!
[00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:53.139]  If you don't want to sign our sovereignty away or get rid of our borders, you're a Nazi.
[00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.580]  And this is all they've got.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.708]  And because they've tried for months to find somebody real saying the N-word or with a swastika sign, they're now going out and doing it themselves.
[00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:03.689]  Now they've always done this.
[00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.875]  That's why the Feds run almost every major white supremacist group in England, Germany, the United States and Canada and Australia.
[00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:13.959]  Over and over and over again.
[00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.420]  Paul Watson's book covers it.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.723]  Published 2003.
[00:02:17.723 --> 00:02:20.346]  Order Out of Chaos.
[00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:23.129]  Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.
[00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.111]  Road to Tyranny covers it.
[00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.253]  My earlier films cover
[00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.558]  Texas Monthly, The London Guardian, Le Figaro out of France, Der Spiegel out of Germany.
[00:02:36.558 --> 00:02:40.943]  Not with the governments infiltrating white supremacists.
[00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:43.005]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.107]  Founding them.
[00:02:45.107 --> 00:02:47.469]  Running them.
[00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.133]  So that they can then try to merge them with mainline groups to demonize them.
[00:02:52.509 --> 00:03:03.915]  That is why you will notice that all the major white supremacist sites 24-7, 24-7 attack yours truly with a wall of lies.
[00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:08.638]  It is a heavily funded government operation caught red-handed.
[00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:12.020]  Just like the Black Congressional Congress was caught a month ago red-handed.
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.001]  Just like these youths in Oregon.
[00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:17.143]  And D.C.
[00:03:17.143 --> 00:03:23.728]  and in areas of New Mexico and Texas, they're all being caught red-handed.
[00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:29.332]  And that is good news because people are now discovering false flag political terror.
[00:03:29.332 --> 00:03:30.273]  And that's what this is.
[00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:31.914]  And there's many other flavors of it.
[00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:37.018]  The police dressing up like anarchists, turning over trash cans, setting fire to trash cans, attacking police.
[00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:42.643]  Caught over and over again from Canada to Greece, from the United States to England, from Australia
[00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:46.970]  to Italy over and over again.
[00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.931]  Mainstream news admitting it.
[00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:51.394]  I mean, they're being caught absolutely 100%.
[00:03:51.394 --> 00:03:52.114]  100%.
[00:03:52.114 --> 00:04:00.241]  So we'll be discussing some of that today.
[00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:09.510]  In other news, homegrown solo terrorist, as bad as Al-Qaeda FBI chief says, so they're announcing openly that Homeland Security is for the American people.
[00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:13.306]  We will continue.
[00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:20.711]  100,000 Britons stranded in Europe by volcanic ash cloud as air traffic chiefs extend lockdown to 7 a.m.
[00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.453]  Why don't they send the EPA over to arrest the volcano?
[00:04:23.453 --> 00:04:26.255]  Or why don't we pay some extra tax money to Al Gore?
[00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:29.647]  He'll wave a wand and stop it.
[00:04:29.647 --> 00:04:32.009]  This could cause global warming or cooling.
[00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:32.429]  Ban it!
[00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:33.310]  Ban the volcano!
[00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.611]  We've got to have stable climate.
[00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:36.092]  You can't have seasons.
[00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:43.118]  It's a conspiracy theory to say that we have regular seasons and that the only thing constant about the climate is that it's constantly changing.
[00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:43.778]  No!
[00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:44.359]  No!
[00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:45.219]  No!
[00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.503]  We've got to somehow plug up that volcano!
[00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:50.604]  We'll be breaking that down.
[00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:51.564]  There's so much news.
[00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:52.945]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:53.466]  Stay with us.
[00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:54.507]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:57.089]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:03.768]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.768 --> 00:05:09.093]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.093 --> 00:05:11.155]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:16.159]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:17.340]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.461]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:20.343]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.343 --> 00:05:21.424]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.424 --> 00:05:23.626]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:24.967]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:26.489]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:26.849]  If there's a
[00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.010]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.731]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:35.333]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:39.134]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:40.375]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:41.275]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:42.376]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:43.296]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.296 --> 00:05:44.397]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.397 --> 00:05:47.458]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:49.619]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[00:05:54.981 --> 00:05:55.821]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:55.821 --> 00:06:05.104]  You may be arrested, and you're subject to public police action.
[00:06:05.104 --> 00:06:06.364]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.364 --> 00:06:10.286]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.526]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.526 --> 00:06:18.388]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.388 --> 00:06:24.610]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.032]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:31.032 --> 00:06:35.213]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.213 --> 00:06:39.494]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.494 --> 00:06:45.456]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:48.997]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.997 --> 00:06:50.958]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:51.398]  It's here.
[00:06:52.078 --> 00:07:00.521]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:05.222]  Rock Creek gently flows through the parkland of Washington, D.C.
[00:07:05.222 --> 00:07:09.564]  until it meets the mighty Potomac River in the heart of the federal city.
[00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:18.694]  On the other hand, Rock Creek Free Press is a fiercely independent newspaper that's not afraid to print the truth.
[00:07:18.694 --> 00:07:21.295]  We print the stories that others won't touch.
[00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:30.181]  The 9-11 cover-up, media propaganda, government corruption, state terrorism, and violations of our constitutional rights.
[00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:33.383]  The Creek is a completely reader-supported publication.
[00:07:33.383 --> 00:07:37.266]  We accept no corporate advertising, no corporate influence.

[00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:53.916]  Rock Creek Free Press.
[00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:55.957]  Not afraid to print the truth.
[00:07:55.957 --> 00:07:56.757]  Call them at 301-452-0090 today.
[00:08:01.846 --> 00:08:07.547]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.547 --> 00:08:25.451]  I want to thank my whole team on this Friday edition, the entire InfoWars crew, on our ship of liberty, for the big success that Fabled Enemies has now become.
[00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:44.459]  With its launch almost two years ago, and now a new film successfully launched, 18 months in the making, Invisible Empire, A New World Order, defined now at PrisonPlanet.tv and shipping out on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:45.921]  Also, uh, yesterday I...
[00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:49.464]  posted a video up on YouTube.
[00:08:49.464 --> 00:08:52.187]  It's now on the front page of YouTube.
[00:08:52.187 --> 00:08:59.714]  It's the top video story in the news and politics section on the front page of YouTube.
[00:08:59.714 --> 00:09:10.385]  The articles are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, where you can also watch the video, iPad Torture to Death in Mass Social Experiment.
[00:09:11.463 --> 00:09:13.464]  Obviously it wasn't really tortured to death.
[00:09:13.464 --> 00:09:15.824]  It's not alive.
[00:09:15.824 --> 00:09:21.826]  But I'll talk more about that coming up and why I did this, what you would call a stunt.
[00:09:21.826 --> 00:09:25.187]  A stunt to wake people up and what my aim was.
[00:09:25.187 --> 00:09:28.569]  And certainly it's been successful.
[00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:32.470]  And I got the response I thought I would get from doing this.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.741]  We've gotten people to think.
[00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:39.282]  Think about how we've devalued human life.
[00:09:39.282 --> 00:09:44.604]  I'll explain that more coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:09:44.604 --> 00:09:51.007]  There's the case of Richard Fine that is in mainstream news, but really in the back of the paper.
[00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:54.069]  A handful of mainstream news articles about it.
[00:09:54.069 --> 00:10:00.692]  And the Supreme Court is going to be hearing it either today or Monday on whether they're going to have a full case
[00:10:02.615 --> 00:10:05.115]  And he has filed lawsuits.
[00:10:05.115 --> 00:10:08.016]  He's a former federal antitrust lawyer.
[00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:12.117]  He has exposed a lot of corruption in Los Angeles and in the county.
[00:10:12.117 --> 00:10:19.858]  And so, without charges, they say he's going to stay in jail for a year on contempt of court.
[00:10:19.858 --> 00:10:22.899]  The judges are saying he's not allowed to have a lawsuit in America.
[00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:24.899]  I mean, you talk about secret police.
[00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:27.119]  You talk about the end of habeas corpus and due process.
[00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:30.660]  You talk about Banana Republic or North Korea.
[00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:35.264]  Or Stalinistic Russia, this is it!
[00:10:35.264 --> 00:10:39.489]  And we see more and more cases like this, so we'll be talking to...
[00:10:41.604 --> 00:10:50.227]  Leslie Dutton, who's the only person who's gotten in to interview Mr. Fine, and we've got her video posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:50.227 --> 00:11:01.670]  She's going to be popping in for 30 minutes in the next hour, the last half hour of the second hour, and then we may even attempt to get Richard Fine on, but we're just going to leave it at that for now.
[00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.752]  And of course, Bob Chapman with us once a week, visit with us every Friday.
[00:11:06.992 --> 00:11:09.475]  Not going to be in the next two weeks after that.
[00:11:09.475 --> 00:11:10.696]  He's going to be on vacation.
[00:11:10.696 --> 00:11:21.608]  So our last interview of April with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster coming up today in the third hour.
[00:11:21.608 --> 00:11:23.030]  Now that said,
[00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:33.291]  I'm going to get into the Icelandic volcano still spewing huge ash plume, shutting down most of the air traffic in England and Europe.
[00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:41.435]  And they say that if it continues to erupt like it is, this could go on for six months.
[00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:44.297]  And again, we've gone over the statistics.
[00:11:44.297 --> 00:11:45.958]  A major volcanic eruption
[00:11:47.051 --> 00:11:51.413]  Like the one that's been going on the last month in Iceland, that's intensifying.
[00:11:51.413 --> 00:11:52.314]  It's like Mount St.
[00:11:52.314 --> 00:11:54.995]  Helens, but it's just going and going and going and going.
[00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:55.395]  Mount St.
[00:11:55.395 --> 00:12:00.758]  Helens just exploded, and did most of its erupting in just a few hours.
[00:12:00.758 --> 00:12:11.423]  No, this thing is just winding up, and now covering much of the Atlantic and Europe in ash, and it only appears, according to volcanologists, to be intensifying.
[00:12:11.423 --> 00:12:15.926]  Now, the question is, can't we have a global government that could stop volcanoes?
[00:12:16.906 --> 00:12:25.070]  I mean, can't we have a tax to save us from this ash that may heat the earth or may cool the earth?
[00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.390]  Volcanoes can do both.
[00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.672]  I mean, we've got to have a constant room temperature globally.
[00:12:30.672 --> 00:12:36.074]  It's a conspiracy theory to say that we ever had winter or spring or summer or fall.
[00:12:36.074 --> 00:12:38.235]  I mean, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:43.538]  The UN says the sun has no effect, and I'm being serious now, on climate, which is asinine.
[00:12:44.378 --> 00:12:48.483]  It's the main driver, according to all the major scientific studies and research.
[00:12:48.483 --> 00:12:56.933]  And volcanoes are one of the other big contributors to that, along with the moon and the tidal forces that it expresses upon the planet.
[00:12:56.933 --> 00:12:59.737]  So, in fact, let me just go ahead and get into that now.
[00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:03.742]  Travel chaos as cloud of ash drifts over Europe.
[00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:15.614]  Volcanic ash sifted down over parts of northern Europe on Friday as thousands of planes stayed on the tarmac to avoid the hazardous cloud.
[00:13:15.614 --> 00:13:22.097]  Travel chaos engulfed major European cities and the UN warned of possible health risk from falling ash.
[00:13:22.097 --> 00:13:33.483]  Ah, the UN's always there in the news as our big mommy to tell us obvious things and to act like they care about us when really their official policy is to reduce world population by at least 80%.
[00:13:33.483 --> 00:13:35.744]  That's the whole point of the world government.
[00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:43.357]  It's a killing stockade, a gurney they strap you down to and give you the lethal injection.
[00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:48.362]  Eurocontrol, Eurocontrol, how Orwellian is that?
[00:13:48.362 --> 00:13:54.487]  The European Air Traffic Agency said the travel disruptions that reverberated throughout the world Thursday
[00:13:55.168 --> 00:14:01.395]  We're even worse on Friday with about 11,000 flights expected to operate in Europe instead of the usual 28,000.
[00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:08.303]  It said delays will continue well into Saturday as the massive yet invisible ash cloud moves slowly south and east.
[00:14:09.824 --> 00:14:14.506]  And another report I've got, they said this could potentially go on off and on for the next six months.
[00:14:14.506 --> 00:14:16.848]  That's what the volcanologists are saying.
[00:14:16.848 --> 00:14:20.329]  There will be significant disruption of air traffic tomorrow.
[00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:33.016]  They went on to say Polish officials fretted that the ash cloud could threaten the arrival of world leaders for Sunday's state funeral of President Kaczynski and his wife Maria in the southern city of Krakow.
[00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:37.638]  His family insisted Friday they wanted the funeral to go forward as planned.
[00:14:39.215 --> 00:14:40.395]  Hmm.
[00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:50.158]  So far, President Barack Obama, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and German Chancellor Merkel are among those coming, and no one has cancelled.
[00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:59.160]  So they always put world leaders in the middle of the news like only they count, and everything they do is so important, when they're nothing but puppets that run absolutely nothing.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.061]  The banks run everything.
[00:15:01.181 --> 00:15:03.721]  There's always propaganda just interwoven into everything.
[00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:07.322]  It's just a tissue of lies and deception.
[00:15:07.322 --> 00:15:08.862]  Here's another one.
[00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:18.084]  100,000 Britons stranded in Europe by volcanic ash cloud as air traffic chiefs extend lockdown to 7 a.m.
[00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:23.865]  And we also have a Reuters story along that same line.
[00:15:23.865 --> 00:15:25.205]  Here's a Wall Street Journal report.
[00:15:25.205 --> 00:15:28.926]  Airlines are grounded as ash clouds spread across Europe.
[00:15:32.742 --> 00:15:35.143]  Here's another story out of the New York Daily News.
[00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:43.187]  Volcanic ash from Iceland strands Norway Prime Minister in New York City Airport, so he governs via iPad.
[00:15:43.187 --> 00:15:45.248]  Yes, the obsession with the iPad.
[00:15:45.248 --> 00:15:49.990]  Hence our video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.151]  Here's an AP article.
[00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:55.233]  Volcanic cloud cast long shadow over US travel.
[00:15:56.249 --> 00:16:09.172]  A volcanic ash cloud that shut down airports and tied up air traffic control across Europe could turn into a long, costly headache for business and airlines and tourists in the United States.
[00:16:09.172 --> 00:16:13.073]  And it continues.
[00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:23.856]  For those that don't know, the sun, then the moon, and this is all debated which one comes first, but it's pretty much agreed the sun is first, but then
[00:16:25.848 --> 00:16:29.671]  Different types of micrometeorites.
[00:16:29.671 --> 00:16:35.616]  Different types of particles coming in out of deep space.
[00:16:35.616 --> 00:16:40.160]  Not just the heat from the sun, but all of the particles it's firing into our atmosphere.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.821]  That's one of the big main drivers.
[00:16:41.821 --> 00:16:44.283]  And you've got the moon and the tidal forces, as I said earlier.
[00:16:44.283 --> 00:16:46.505]  And then it's volcanoes.
[00:16:47.671 --> 00:17:00.677]  In fact, I've seen the statistics on it, you can pull them up, but roughly the amount of ash and greenhouse gas emissions and particulate that was put into the air by Mount St.
[00:17:00.677 --> 00:17:10.402]  Helens in 1980 was more than all of the soot and all of the pollutants put out by man in the previous hundred years.
[00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:12.982]  Does that give you an idea?
[00:17:12.982 --> 00:17:15.963]  That was a conservative estimate.
[00:17:15.963 --> 00:17:21.144]  And this one, if it continues, could be bigger in the aggregate than Mount St.
[00:17:21.144 --> 00:17:23.424]  Helens.
[00:17:23.424 --> 00:17:39.787]  The point is, man is like a speck on the back of a flea, and the flea is sitting on the back of an elephant, and the elephant is sitting in the middle of the state of Texas.
[00:17:41.152 --> 00:17:43.333]  And man is that speck on the back of a flea.
[00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:50.437]  I mean we just have almost no effect unless there's a nuclear weapons exchange or
[00:17:51.437 --> 00:18:04.980]  Nanotech gets out of control, or all these cross-species genetic engineering experiments that have gone on with viruses and bacteria and plant and animal and insect life and fungus all mixed together.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:15.523]  All of the top scientists that study this are on record saying this could create a calamity that, well, an accurate description of it is something like the Andromeda Strain, that movie back in the 1970s.
[00:18:17.659 --> 00:18:36.949]  That's actually based on some of the fears of microbiologists about life forms that could be delivered here via comets or asteroids, and that could really shake up life on this planet, or something created in a laboratory.
[00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.830]  And that's the type of thing I'm worried about.
[00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:46.514]  But the UN and the Globalist, the Club of Rome, they didn't pick some real threat to have their excuse to set up a tyranny.
[00:18:47.762 --> 00:18:57.008]  Because they're all in mad races against each other to come up with the super weapons and the life extension and the genetic engineering.
[00:18:57.008 --> 00:19:00.510]  None of that is even being watched or dealt with.
[00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.071]  No.
[00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:05.434]  And that could be done on a country by country basis just by education.
[00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:07.235]  And if the elites wanted to inform the public.
[00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:08.696]  No.
[00:19:08.696 --> 00:19:09.957]  No.
[00:19:09.957 --> 00:19:12.959]  No transparency.
[00:19:12.959 --> 00:19:14.740]  In the mad rush for godhood.
[00:19:16.963 --> 00:19:22.067]  I'm not saying the elites will ever become God or God-like, but that's what they say they want.
[00:19:22.067 --> 00:19:25.769]  Control over the weather, omnipresent control over information.
[00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:33.655]  Control over our healthcare, over our reproduction, over our finances, tracking everything we do.
[00:19:33.655 --> 00:19:38.038]  So the elite are actually horrible stewards, and they're not really in control.
[00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:43.502]  Oh, they're in control over the money, they're in control over most of the systems, but they're not even governing themselves.
[00:19:46.172 --> 00:19:48.014]  Here's a big headline.
[00:19:48.014 --> 00:19:50.556]  SEC charges Goldman Sachs with fraud.
[00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:51.117]  CNN.
[00:19:51.117 --> 00:19:53.099]  This is huge news.
[00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:55.702]  Alright, I'm going to run through the top stories.
[00:19:55.702 --> 00:19:59.065]  Then we're going to go to your calls and then go back through the top news in detail.
[00:19:59.065 --> 00:19:59.525]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:02.042]  You worry.
[00:20:02.042 --> 00:20:04.083]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:20:04.083 --> 00:20:06.625]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:08.707]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.328]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:13.911]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:19.155]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:22.958]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.659]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:20:24.659 --> 00:20:27.241]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:20:27.501 --> 00:20:30.803]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:20:30.803 --> 00:20:39.249]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:20:39.249 --> 00:20:43.933]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:20:43.933 --> 00:20:47.956]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[00:20:51.798 --> 00:20:53.199]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:20:57.202 --> 00:21:03.146]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:03.146 --> 00:21:05.348]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:08.650]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:13.774]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:17.957]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:20.618]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.618 --> 00:21:23.159]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:26.421]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:34.024]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.344 --> 00:21:39.707]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.707 --> 00:21:42.068]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:46.291]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:47.371]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.371 --> 00:21:48.692]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.692 --> 00:21:50.193]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:10.013]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:10.013 --> 00:22:16.456]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.456 --> 00:22:25.300]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:34.866]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:34.866 --> 00:22:39.468]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:39.468 --> 00:22:41.269]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:43.791]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:47.373]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:52.916]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.247 --> 00:23:01.969]  Oh, my sinuses!
[00:23:01.969 --> 00:23:03.910]  They feel like they'll explode!
[00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:04.731]  Sinus pressure.
[00:23:04.731 --> 00:23:06.492]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:23:06.492 --> 00:23:07.753]  You've struggled for years.
[00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:13.597]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:23:13.597 --> 00:23:14.358]  Sound familiar?
[00:23:14.358 --> 00:23:15.399]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:23:15.399 --> 00:23:19.061]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:23.885]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[00:23:24.085 --> 00:23:26.726]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor recommended.

[00:23:58.764 --> 00:23:59.245]  It works!
[00:24:08.393 --> 00:24:15.579]  Four months ago, we had Greg Gordon who did a five-part series for McClatchy Newspapers on the show.
[00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:21.104]  He's a top financial investigative reporter.
[00:24:21.104 --> 00:24:24.526]  He's rated as one of the top in the country.
[00:24:24.526 --> 00:24:29.451]  And via lawsuits, he was able to get internal Goldman Sachs
[00:24:30.436 --> 00:24:31.336]  Emails.
[00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:48.502]  Now, of course, there's separate Goldman Sachs emails from Geithner's deputy under orders from Geithner when he was New York Fed head, which is even more powerful than the head of the Department of Treasury, which he now sits in.
[00:24:48.502 --> 00:24:57.385]  He was working with his counterpart, his former Goldman Sachs boss, Henry Paulson, to cover up the trillions, not the 780
[00:25:00.814 --> 00:25:03.595]  Whatever it was, billion, that the media keeps talking about.
[00:25:03.595 --> 00:25:08.176]  That was only one of three revolving lines of credit.
[00:25:08.176 --> 00:25:11.617]  And they've gone back to that 700-plus billion window over and over again.
[00:25:11.617 --> 00:25:13.577]  That's only one of the three ways.
[00:25:13.577 --> 00:25:17.058]  Again, we haven't gotten new numbers in over three months from Bloomberg.
[00:25:17.058 --> 00:25:19.759]  Bloomberg's the one filing most of these suits.
[00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:23.980]  It was $23.7 trillion in November of last year.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.821]  In January of this year, it was $28 trillion.
[00:25:27.481 --> 00:25:28.121]  And counting.
[00:25:28.121 --> 00:25:29.561]  So we don't know.
[00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:35.483]  At current growth rates, it's probably $33, $34, $35 trillion.
[00:25:35.483 --> 00:25:36.523]  We don't know.
[00:25:36.523 --> 00:25:41.324]  Okay, that's the level of the heist going on by the Goldman Sachs crew.
[00:25:41.324 --> 00:25:43.564]  They're the main management firm.
[00:25:43.564 --> 00:25:46.105]  Because in a criminal operation, you've got to keep it small.
[00:25:46.105 --> 00:25:51.566]  So the big central banks, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank, and others, they're all
[00:25:52.606 --> 00:25:53.507]  Getting the money as well.
[00:25:53.507 --> 00:26:01.858]  They're all sharing it, but their management group is Goldman Sachs because they've got their people in every level of government, not just here in the US, but in every country they're robbing.
[00:26:01.858 --> 00:26:09.488]  Chile, Greenland, Greece, Iceland, New Zealand,
[00:26:11.094 --> 00:26:18.319]  Poland, I mean, it's just every country, the finance minister or the treasury secretary is Goldman Sachs, but I'm all over the map here.
[00:26:18.319 --> 00:26:26.725]  It's just to try to even talk about this huge breaking news that was just put into my hand 10 minutes ago.
[00:26:26.725 --> 00:26:28.306]  It's only the tip of the iceberg, as they say.
[00:26:30.473 --> 00:26:31.935]  And Geithner is on record.
[00:26:31.935 --> 00:26:40.243]  Remember, there was talk three or four months ago of criminal indictments of Geithner or his underlings from the New York branch of the Fed.
[00:26:40.243 --> 00:26:41.625]  That's the main corporate office.
[00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:43.907]  That's the Fed that has all the power.
[00:26:43.907 --> 00:26:49.974]  The private holding company for the private banks, which they've never allowed an audit of.
[00:26:49.974 --> 00:26:51.716]  And that Ron Paul's bill would audit.
[00:26:51.716 --> 00:26:52.857]  It's passed the House and the Senate.
[00:26:56.161 --> 00:27:20.664]  And so this is a big deal that Greg Gordon and others were able to get these emails just in one little criminal area where Goldman Sachs, two years before the housing bubble imploded, we were on air warning you with all our financial experts, it was obvious, that they were betting against the housing market and helped implode it so they could then have this big bailout and destroy their competition.
[00:27:20.664 --> 00:27:21.585]  And that's in the emails.
[00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:41.944]  So, while they were setting up the implosion, running the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, the alumni, the former CEOs and their deputies of Goldman Sachs, filling every major regulatory position, they were setting up this inside job.
[00:27:41.944 --> 00:27:48.049]  This is only one area of it, but they were caught red-handed in their emails that came out via lawsuits.
[00:27:50.441 --> 00:28:00.502]  Telling investors and not just private investors, not just citizens of different countries, but governments, cities, counties, police unions.
[00:28:03.464 --> 00:28:17.307]  Retirement funds for city workers, police, fire, teachers unions, university pension funds, government pension funds, private pension funds, trillions and trillions of dollars.
[00:28:17.307 --> 00:28:31.290]  They're saying invest in this, and they had another insurance company, AIG, certify it as AAA gold 100% when they knew it was absolute trash, absolute garbage, absolute
[00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:37.652]  Bernie Madoff eclipsing fraud.
[00:28:37.652 --> 00:28:46.558]  That'd be like if I was selling copper coins plated in gold and I was telling you that they were solid gold.
[00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:47.658]  I mean, that is fraud.
[00:28:47.658 --> 00:28:51.221]  If I was doing that, if you were doing that, you would go to jail.
[00:28:51.221 --> 00:28:52.922]  Well, this is selling investments
[00:28:54.161 --> 00:29:04.068]  To governments, to pension funds, to private individuals, and to institutions, as if it was pure, triple-A rated, the best investment you could have.
[00:29:04.068 --> 00:29:06.170]  And here's their own emails and documents.
[00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:18.319]  They knew it was total trash, and it was being done by design to screw up the markets so they could vertically integrate and consolidate the markets, because they had their people in control of every major government on Earth.
[00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:21.041]  Not just the United States.
[00:29:21.041 --> 00:29:21.762]  And it goes further.
[00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:27.137]  They were telling people to invest in it while they were doing this.
[00:29:27.137 --> 00:29:33.160]  And I, boy, I tell you, I don't know how this is happening because Obama is run by Goldman Sachs.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:40.143]  He got five times the money from Goldman Sachs that McCain did, four times overall from Wall Street that McCain got.
[00:29:40.143 --> 00:29:47.286]  And I don't, they may use the investigation as a cover-up, as a way to suck up all the info and classify it.
[00:29:47.286 --> 00:29:48.846]  We'll talk about more of this when we come back.
[00:29:48.846 --> 00:29:49.787]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.785 --> 00:29:54.687]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.687 --> 00:30:00.211]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.211 --> 00:30:01.511]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:07.095]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:07.095 --> 00:30:12.118]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:12.118 --> 00:30:17.141]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:22.906]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:22.906 --> 00:30:25.208]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:30.012]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:30.012 --> 00:30:31.133]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:34.196]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:30:34.196 --> 00:30:37.499]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:37.819 --> 00:30:41.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.221]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:44.161]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:44.161 --> 00:30:44.361]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:44.361 --> 00:30:47.802]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:47.802 --> 00:30:49.542]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:59.873 --> 00:31:02.174]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:31:02.174 --> 00:31:04.575]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:31:04.575 --> 00:31:07.776]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:31:07.776 --> 00:31:12.899]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:17.421]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:31:17.421 --> 00:31:19.862]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:31:19.862 --> 00:31:22.303]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:31:22.303 --> 00:31:25.144]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:31:25.544 --> 00:31:33.486]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:31:33.486 --> 00:31:38.868]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:31:38.868 --> 00:31:41.189]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:31:41.189 --> 00:31:45.130]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.491]  And I got news for you.
[00:31:46.491 --> 00:31:47.833]  You're everyone else.
[00:31:47.833 --> 00:31:49.314]  Invisible Empire.

[00:32:00.117 --> 00:32:01.758]  Everyone, Andy Anderson here.
[00:32:01.758 --> 00:32:06.159]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:11.961]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:32:11.961 --> 00:32:16.302]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[00:32:16.302 --> 00:32:18.003]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:32:18.163 --> 00:32:19.504]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:23.908]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:26.090]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:38.120]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.141]  Moles and fungus, too.
[00:32:39.141 --> 00:32:40.742]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[00:32:40.802 --> 00:32:43.986]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[00:32:43.986 --> 00:32:45.147]  No more dry skin.
[00:32:45.147 --> 00:32:49.752]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[00:32:49.752 --> 00:32:56.941]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:57.221]  That's 888-245-0300.
[00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:14.935]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231 on this April 16, 2010 edition.
[00:33:14.935 --> 00:33:26.221]  I'd like to hear from folks that routed tea parties across the country, ran into provocateurs.
[00:33:26.221 --> 00:33:31.924]  I've got a whole bunch of news articles, and the news generally leaves it vague.
[00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.671]  The NewMexicoIndependent.com didn't.
[00:33:36.671 --> 00:33:45.333]  They pointed out these were anti-Tea Party people with signs that said, Nazi youth for lower taxes with big swastikas.
[00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:49.714]  That's the type of low-down evil that we're talking about.
[00:33:49.714 --> 00:34:02.638]  I mean, false flag frame-ups are so common now that the Democratic Party has giant armies of ne'er-do-wells to go out and engage in this type of defamation.
[00:34:04.377 --> 00:34:05.398]  So I'm going to be getting into that.
[00:34:05.398 --> 00:34:08.220]  I want to get your take on it.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.541]  Also, Newt Gingrich.
[00:34:09.541 --> 00:34:10.302]  I didn't know this.
[00:34:10.302 --> 00:34:17.127]  Newt Gingrich was the main Tea Party spokesperson at the Texas State Capitol yesterday.
[00:34:17.127 --> 00:34:23.592]  There were a whole bunch of different Tea Party events down there of the news reports.
[00:34:23.592 --> 00:34:24.773]  Every few hours, a new group.
[00:34:24.773 --> 00:34:29.136]  But one of the main groups, the Houston Chronicle reports,
[00:34:31.258 --> 00:34:40.564]  Wanted it to be clear that they are not for Texas secession and they are not extremist and they like Newt Gingrich, who's going to be running for president for the 2012 elections.
[00:34:40.564 --> 00:34:47.348]  And here is Newt Gingrich, a guy who believes in global warming, wants a global carbon tax, wants a world government, has written books about it.
[00:34:49.144 --> 00:34:56.550]  And he's praised by Limbaugh and others, and we're told how good he is, and he's basically another eugenicist.
[00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:03.115]  And a few days ago I heard the state of Texas, that the Republicans are pushing a contract with Texas.
[00:35:03.115 --> 00:35:05.697]  And it's got all these vague things they pledge.
[00:35:05.697 --> 00:35:07.959]  I pledge to be conservative.
[00:35:07.959 --> 00:35:10.501]  I pledge to promote controlling our borders.
[00:35:11.445 --> 00:35:13.005]  They need to be specific.
[00:35:13.005 --> 00:35:15.626]  It's another vague contract on America.
[00:35:15.626 --> 00:35:19.247]  And I said, I smell Newt Gingrich in this, but I didn't have time to research it.
[00:35:19.247 --> 00:35:31.351]  Then I found out in two different news articles in Texas this morning that Newt Gingrich is touring Texas and other states and creating a contract with America at the federal level and a contract with America at the state level.
[00:35:31.351 --> 00:35:32.372]  Newt Gingrich went in in 1994.
[00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:38.628]  He led the Republicans as a fake conservative and led them over the edge of a cliff.
[00:35:38.628 --> 00:35:43.990]  It's like Obama is there to give left cover and expand war and torture and warrantless wiretapping.
[00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:49.673]  The Feds are in court today, by the way, pushing for unlimited warrantless scanning of all your emails.
[00:35:49.673 --> 00:35:51.113]  They're already reading them all.
[00:35:51.113 --> 00:35:52.794]  But they want to be able to use them in court.
[00:35:52.794 --> 00:35:54.575]  They want to have it out in the open.
[00:35:54.575 --> 00:35:56.536]  That everything you do is being tracked.
[00:35:56.536 --> 00:36:00.617]  Everywhere you go via your cell phone is being watched.
[00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:01.578]  And I've got another story that
[00:36:05.612 --> 00:36:22.068]  Dovetails in with that it turns out that in Pennsylvania and Several other areas in fact, I'm looking I'm looking for my article about the laptops Laptops took thousands of pictures.
[00:36:22.068 --> 00:36:30.256]  Will you guys print that for me again because I had that here in my stack and I'm And I suddenly
[00:36:32.082 --> 00:36:34.085]  Suddenly can't find it.
[00:36:34.085 --> 00:36:38.330]  You'll have this stuff right in front of you.
[00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:39.792]  And then you won't.
[00:36:39.792 --> 00:36:46.961]  But the point is that public schools all over the country, all over the nation,
[00:36:48.966 --> 00:37:13.534]  are watching students at home and one newspaper published photos the family got via lawsuits of their son in bed and it's got quotes by the teacher saying oh I just love this soap opera watching these people in their homes and the laptops have got audio and video it's just that the school officials they're they're not
[00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:17.807]  Servants, they're officials.
[00:37:17.807 --> 00:37:23.412]  School officials just sit there and take screenshots of the video.
[00:37:23.412 --> 00:37:25.474]  So we'll be showing that when we're live at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:32.852]  And so that's just some of what's coming up.
[00:37:32.852 --> 00:37:34.013]  I meant to get to this yesterday.
[00:37:34.013 --> 00:37:38.056]  This is the type of bizarre news that's out there that actually threatens our society.
[00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:39.397]  This is out of the sun.
[00:37:39.397 --> 00:37:41.299]  Three parent kids.
[00:37:41.299 --> 00:37:46.202]  UK scientists have created designer embryos containing DNA from a man and two women.
[00:37:46.202 --> 00:37:51.847]  The breakthrough gives hope of healthy children to couples with genetic disorders in their families.
[00:37:53.826 --> 00:37:57.647]  It also offers the prospect of eradicating fatal genetic diseases.
[00:37:57.647 --> 00:38:03.249]  And see, that's what the eugenicists really want, is they're going to go in and decide who can have babies.
[00:38:03.249 --> 00:38:10.772]  They're taking your blood at birth in every industrialized nation for 37 years under a secret UN agreement that's now public.
[00:38:12.005 --> 00:38:18.888]  They're now introducing it to you in the news that, well, yes, we have been taking your blood.
[00:38:18.888 --> 00:38:24.731]  And then a month later, yeah, it goes to the Pentagon and the U.N., and yeah, it's been going on for decades, 37 years to be exact.
[00:38:27.802 --> 00:38:30.483]  And yeah, we're studying your DNA.
[00:38:30.483 --> 00:38:38.165]  And then I've got CBS News reporting that in the last 20 years, big genome companies have bought your blood samples.
[00:38:38.165 --> 00:38:44.767]  They go in and patent your DNA and proteins and different things that are unique to individuals.
[00:38:44.767 --> 00:38:52.450]  And then you're going in to get genetic treatment that might have been $10,000, $15,000, and they say, sorry, we have patented your genes.
[00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.510]  And people say, well, where did you?
[00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.990]  Get the patent.
[00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:59.691]  And that's one reason this finally broke mainstream news the last few years.
[00:38:59.691 --> 00:39:05.032]  In the San Francisco Chronicles, the first place I saw it, we have the documents 14 years ago.
[00:39:05.032 --> 00:39:07.453]  They were sent to me by a nurse.
[00:39:07.453 --> 00:39:08.293]  But I'll just leave it at that.
[00:39:08.293 --> 00:39:13.254]  The point is that they go, well, where did you get my blood?
[00:39:13.254 --> 00:39:15.115]  How do you own my blood?
[00:39:15.115 --> 00:39:18.395]  And they say, oh, we got it from these databases.
[00:39:18.395 --> 00:39:19.996]  People say, where did you get that?
[00:39:19.996 --> 00:39:20.896]  I never agreed to that.
[00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:31.597]  And then federal courts have ruled, yes, they own your blood, and we're going to take your blood, and now the police all over the world are being trained to take blood at checkpoints.
[00:39:31.597 --> 00:39:34.918]  And they're breaking the ice with, oh, it's for drunk driving.
[00:39:34.918 --> 00:39:42.362]  Kind of like, oh, the Marines are in Tennessee, oh, they're in California, oh, they're in Michigan, oh, they're in Florida running checkpoints.
[00:39:42.362 --> 00:39:43.923]  Well, that violates positive commentators.
[00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:46.344]  Oh, but it's for drunk drivers, and they also search your vehicles.
[00:39:47.546 --> 00:39:50.127]  See, they follow a PR script.
[00:39:50.127 --> 00:39:52.228]  Well, you're against drunk driving, aren't you?
[00:39:52.228 --> 00:39:54.609]  Well, we gotta have the Marines out here.
[00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:57.930]  Regular Marines.
[00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.851]  So this is how it works.
[00:40:00.851 --> 00:40:12.436]  They're going to go in, and I've seen government documents where they talk about this and say, oh, your DNA doesn't just say that you have a propensity to pass on certain types of cancers.
[00:40:14.582 --> 00:40:21.726]  Or your DNA shows that there's a 30% chance your child's gonna have a cleft palate.
[00:40:21.726 --> 00:40:32.812]  Because this science is so foggy, government can lie and claim that you have evidence of possible disorders or diseases, genetic traits that you can pass on.
[00:40:32.812 --> 00:40:35.113]  They can just lie.
[00:40:35.113 --> 00:40:39.916]  And more importantly, they're already discussing saying, oh, you have aggression genes.
[00:40:42.113 --> 00:40:43.594]  You have anger genes.
[00:40:43.594 --> 00:40:47.275]  You have genes that show a propensity for drug abuse.
[00:40:47.275 --> 00:40:53.558]  You have genes that show that you're inclined to be depressed.
[00:40:53.558 --> 00:41:05.442]  That's why in Road to Tyranny, we cover some of this, but then in the 2007 film Endgame, I show mainstream British news where it says two-year-olds are on probation in England.
[00:41:05.442 --> 00:41:08.924]  Now why are tens of thousands of two-year-olds on probation in England?
[00:41:10.831 --> 00:41:11.813]  I'm not joking, folks.
[00:41:11.813 --> 00:41:13.676]  You can go look it up.
[00:41:13.676 --> 00:41:20.006]  Because their parents have a criminal record or have been in a psychiatric system somehow.
[00:41:21.661 --> 00:41:23.783]  Oh, they tell you, you must be depressed.
[00:41:23.783 --> 00:41:25.604]  Let me send you to a government psychologist.
[00:41:25.604 --> 00:41:27.525]  It's all paid for, honey.
[00:41:27.525 --> 00:41:28.726]  You're 17 years old.
[00:41:28.726 --> 00:41:29.306]  You're depressed.
[00:41:29.306 --> 00:41:30.847]  Your boyfriend broke up with you.
[00:41:30.847 --> 00:41:32.048]  Let us send you to a doctor.
[00:41:32.048 --> 00:41:33.950]  And then they give you some Prozac.
[00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.331]  And then five years later, you have a child.
[00:41:36.331 --> 00:41:39.573]  And they come to you and they say, your child is now in a database.
[00:41:39.573 --> 00:41:47.399]  And at age two, must have monthly meetings with a social worker to ask them questions and put them in a database of potential criminals.
[00:41:50.373 --> 00:41:53.395]  So if you want to know how this medical tyranny is going to work, this is it.
[00:41:53.395 --> 00:41:54.616]  And it's not a joke.
[00:41:54.616 --> 00:41:59.239]  What, four years ago we got the New Freedom Initiative documents.
[00:41:59.239 --> 00:42:01.900]  It was actually in major newspapers.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.823]  Because one of the board members in, what was it in that case, Pennsylvania?
[00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:10.106]  No, it was Ohio.
[00:42:10.106 --> 00:42:13.428]  Just for the state board of the New Freedom Initiative, he was given the documents.
[00:42:14.406 --> 00:42:21.569]  And it said, this is all to make money, we've got 20% of the kids roughly on drugs right now, psychotropics, or Ritalin, different classes.
[00:42:21.569 --> 00:42:23.630]  And our goal is, by 2015, to have 50%.
[00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:30.413]  Our goal is, in 10 years, that was 2005, our goal is to have 50% of children on drugs, and then by 2025, we want 100% on drugs.
[00:42:43.667 --> 00:42:44.987]  100%!
[00:42:44.987 --> 00:42:46.488]  You're going to be forced medicated.
[00:42:46.488 --> 00:42:51.029]  Now that's in the plan.
[00:42:51.029 --> 00:42:53.909]  I mean, how can you say that's a good thing?
[00:42:53.909 --> 00:43:01.451]  Well, look at the national average of foster children on psychotropic drugs.
[00:43:01.451 --> 00:43:02.211]  Pull it up yourself.
[00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:04.151]  Just national average.
[00:43:04.151 --> 00:43:05.031]  Search engine this term.
[00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:08.232]  In fact, get this for me guys, just to show people I'm not making this stuff up.
[00:43:09.673 --> 00:43:15.157]  Two-thirds of foster children on drugs, psychotropic drugs.
[00:43:15.157 --> 00:43:16.638]  The state of Texas is even higher.
[00:43:16.638 --> 00:43:18.879]  I think it's 69 percent.
[00:43:18.879 --> 00:43:21.821]  The national average is about 65.
[00:43:21.821 --> 00:43:23.403]  That was a few years ago, last time I checked.
[00:43:23.403 --> 00:43:24.824]  We're going to find out right now.
[00:43:24.824 --> 00:43:25.784]  It's always growing.
[00:43:25.784 --> 00:43:33.830]  So see, when the government has you in its custody, 60 plus percent of the time, or two-thirds of the time,
[00:43:39.192 --> 00:43:40.533]  Yeah, there's the headline.
[00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:42.114]  WOAI Television.
[00:43:42.114 --> 00:43:46.778]  Two out of three foster children in Texas on psychotropic medication.
[00:43:46.778 --> 00:43:50.141]  But that's only Texas that mirrors the national average.
[00:43:50.141 --> 00:43:51.482]  Pull me up the national average.
[00:43:51.482 --> 00:43:53.403]  I believe it's going to be 65, 66, 67.
[00:43:53.403 --> 00:43:56.446]  I'm seeing different numbers.
[00:43:56.446 --> 00:43:57.507]  So again, there you go.
[00:43:57.507 --> 00:43:59.989]  When they are in control, close to 70%,
[00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:13.434]  Are on these brain-damaging, life-destroying drugs.
[00:44:13.434 --> 00:44:15.398]  This is about control, and they want 100%.
[00:44:15.398 --> 00:44:19.284]  This is how eugenics is going to be carried out.
[00:44:19.284 --> 00:44:21.148]  You're not going to be allowed to have children.
[00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:31.024]  And if you do get pregnant, you're going to have to hide the baby if they have their way, if they get away with this.
[00:44:31.024 --> 00:44:44.068]  And after a nuke attack and some more wars and a police state, they already got you going in naked body scanners, cops taking blood at checkpoints without warrants, they're already taking your baby's blood at birth to give it to the Pentagon and the Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics Lab with IBM.
[00:44:49.474 --> 00:44:55.277]  They say that they are going to come and get you and forcibly abort your child.
[00:45:09.528 --> 00:45:10.489]  This is the tyranny.
[00:45:10.489 --> 00:45:13.011]  I mean, I have seen it in report after report after report.
[00:45:13.011 --> 00:45:14.572]  This is what they're going to do.
[00:45:14.572 --> 00:45:19.536]  In fact, in the extras for Endgame, Dr. Michael Kaufman reads from a major U.S.
[00:45:19.536 --> 00:45:25.461]  university study in the early 60s, funded by the federal government, where they said, by 2000,
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:35.804]  People will be obsessed with luxury and little electronic games they're going to have.
[00:45:35.804 --> 00:45:52.214]  Most of the public is going to be on government-issued drugs, and we are going to anesthetize people and drug them and put them into a form of television mind control, and then we're going to phase in one-child policies and taking people's children.
[00:45:53.442 --> 00:45:54.883]  I forget the study, but it's in the film.
[00:45:54.883 --> 00:45:55.963]  He reads from it.
[00:45:55.963 --> 00:45:57.524]  It's in the extras.
[00:45:57.524 --> 00:46:02.227]  It's actually in Endgame 1.5, the extras for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:46:02.227 --> 00:46:06.569]  Expanded extras.
[00:46:06.569 --> 00:46:12.152]  Alright, I said I'd go to your phone calls, and I... I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:26.013]  But, uh, here's that article I mentioned out of Philadelphia, and I've seen these reports in Tennessee, California, everywhere.
[00:46:26.013 --> 00:46:43.200]  I mean, I saw these reports eight, nine years ago, where in Sacramento, it said the police were watching the girls in the showers, and that was okay, and Tennessee was doing it, and they were sharing the videos everywhere, and it's quite normal.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:43.760]  Lawyer!
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.701]  Laptops took thousands of images.
[00:46:45.701 --> 00:46:47.982]  This is out of, uh,
[00:46:51.138 --> 00:46:53.820]  Philly.com.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:58.263]  Philadelphia Inquirer, not the National Inquirer.
[00:46:58.263 --> 00:47:05.269]  The system that lower Marion school officials use to track lost, stolen laptops, and it's on most of the school-issued laptops nationwide.
[00:47:05.269 --> 00:47:08.071]  The Fed's part of their grant demand you have this.
[00:47:08.071 --> 00:47:09.051]  See, they've got it all figured out.
[00:47:09.051 --> 00:47:17.598]  And they come in and show them how to use it, and the system that lower Marion school officials use to track lost and stolen laptops, oh, it's always a stop crime, isn't it?
[00:47:19.724 --> 00:47:29.487]  Wound up secretly capturing thousands of images including photographs of students in their homes, websites they visited, and excerpts of their online chats.
[00:47:29.487 --> 00:47:33.628]  Says a new motion filed in a suit against the district.
[00:47:33.628 --> 00:47:48.293]  More than once the motion asserts, and they've released the photos, the camera on Robbins' school issued laptop took photos of Robbins as he slept in his bed.
[00:47:48.293 --> 00:47:48.753]  Each time
[00:47:51.778 --> 00:47:55.979]  It fired the images off to a network servers at the school district.
[00:47:55.979 --> 00:48:05.721]  Back at the school offices, the Robbins motion says, employees with access to the images marveled at the tracking software.
[00:48:05.721 --> 00:48:10.942]  It was like a window into a quote, little LMSD soap opera.
[00:48:10.942 --> 00:48:13.422]  I don't watch soap opera, so I don't know what that means.
[00:48:13.422 --> 00:48:15.003]  LMSD soap opera.
[00:48:15.003 --> 00:48:20.944]  A staffer is quoted as saying in an email to Carol Cafaro, the administrator running the program.
[00:48:21.977 --> 00:48:22.357]  I know.
[00:48:22.357 --> 00:48:23.338]  I love it.
[00:48:23.338 --> 00:48:25.598]  She is quoted as having replied.
[00:48:25.598 --> 00:48:33.962]  Well, we've got a frontline special of another school where they're sitting there on national television showing them how they're watching the kids.
[00:48:33.962 --> 00:48:37.723]  It was the school bragging about this is the reason we know.
[00:48:37.723 --> 00:48:39.484]  Why is this saying it's alleged?
[00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:44.673]  I know, I love it, she's quoted as having replied.
[00:48:44.673 --> 00:48:59.081]  Those details disclosed in a motion filed late Thursday in federal court by Robbins' attorney offer a wide glimpse into the now-disabled program that spawned Robbins' lawsuit and has shined an international spotlight on the district.
[00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:05.385]  See, but there's really no articles in the news about, well, wait a minute, this was on Frontline a year and a half ago.
[00:49:05.385 --> 00:49:08.567]  Wait a minute, there's hundreds of articles where this has come out elsewhere.
[00:49:09.326 --> 00:49:17.531]  I mean, why aren't they talking about cameras in the school showers watching the naked children?
[00:49:17.531 --> 00:49:24.696]  I mean, any real journalist or even just an average person could go search engine hundreds of articles about this that I know I've seen.
[00:49:24.696 --> 00:49:29.279]  I could send her off my memory right now and just snap off headlines and have the guys pull it up.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.602]  Maybe I should do that later when we're live on PrisonPlanet.tv, show everybody the articles.
[00:49:34.602 --> 00:49:39.365]  It's one thing to... I mean, here's an example, and I'm shifting gears out of this for a moment, I'm gonna get back into it after calls.
[00:49:39.365 --> 00:49:46.629]  And then the whole Goldman Sachs situation, this is huge, being indicted.
[00:49:46.629 --> 00:49:52.692]  I went on Russia Today yesterday, did a little five and a half minute piece, it's on in the US, Europe, worldwide.
[00:49:52.692 --> 00:49:55.234]  Watson, over in Sheffield, can watch it on broadcast TV.
[00:49:56.977 --> 00:49:58.138]  Reaches millions.
[00:49:58.138 --> 00:49:59.999]  It's a great outlet.
[00:49:59.999 --> 00:50:02.961]  And I go on there and criticize our government, Russia, whatever.
[00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:04.062]  They just let me.
[00:50:04.062 --> 00:50:04.823]  They let me tell the truth.
[00:50:04.823 --> 00:50:05.984]  It's amazing.
[00:50:05.984 --> 00:50:21.955]  And I went on there because this Army report saying that within two to five years we could have $150 a barrel oil and that gas could be $6, $7 a gallon and that we're going to have this big oil shortage because there's not enough refineries and enough oil.
[00:50:21.955 --> 00:50:23.856]  And I went on there and I said, well, the AP reported in 2000 and 2006
[00:50:27.214 --> 00:50:39.893]  Uh, that they had sued and gotten the oil company documents where a cartel met in 95 and 96 and said we're going to shut down refineries and not build new ones because there's too much oil, we're going to create an artificial bottleneck.
[00:50:41.408 --> 00:50:46.292]  And then I saw the comments on the video, clearly paid for, saying, Jones doesn't know about the oil business.
[00:50:46.292 --> 00:50:46.972]  He's a liar.
[00:50:46.972 --> 00:50:48.033]  This isn't true.
[00:50:48.033 --> 00:50:48.393]  Oh, really?
[00:50:48.393 --> 00:50:51.976]  I'm having Watson post the Russia Today with the links to the AP.
[00:50:51.976 --> 00:50:52.537]  Okay?
[00:50:52.537 --> 00:50:54.698]  We don't make anything up.
[00:50:54.698 --> 00:50:56.019]  You got that?
[00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.140]  We don't make any of it up.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.381]  You understand me?
[00:50:58.381 --> 00:50:59.382]  We don't make anything up.
[00:50:59.382 --> 00:51:00.083]  We tell the truth.

[00:52:01.156 --> 00:52:03.538]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.538 --> 00:52:05.860]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.082]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:09.082 --> 00:52:14.186]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.186 --> 00:52:18.390]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.151]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:21.151 --> 00:52:23.572]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.572 --> 00:52:26.813]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.813 --> 00:52:34.416]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.756 --> 00:52:40.161]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.161 --> 00:52:42.463]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.463 --> 00:52:46.706]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.706 --> 00:52:47.787]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.787 --> 00:52:49.108]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:14.756 --> 00:54:29.522]  AP, homegrown solo terrorist as bad as Al-Qaeda, FBI chief says, that's all part of the big kickoff I told you in the month of April a few months ago that was going to blame anybody who doesn't want big government or tyranny as being a terrorist.
[00:54:29.522 --> 00:54:31.103]  And so now it's a full court press.
[00:54:31.103 --> 00:54:36.385]  They've got their people everywhere with Nazi signs just showing you how criminal the government is.
[00:54:37.085 --> 00:54:47.950]  That's not saying all the police or all the FBI or all the bureaucrats are evil individuals, but their directorates, the systems that are in control, are wicked, are evil.
[00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:53.272]  We're in a lot of trouble, ladies and gentlemen, we have to recognize that.
[00:54:53.272 --> 00:54:55.473]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Texas.
[00:54:55.473 --> 00:54:56.414]  You're on the air, Fred.
[00:54:56.414 --> 00:54:58.955]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[00:54:59.482 --> 00:55:00.063]  Thanks for calling.
[00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:00.604]  What's on your mind?
[00:55:16.565 --> 00:55:17.886]  Awe-inspiring, watching that movie.
[00:55:37.529 --> 00:55:45.772]  Yeah, it was incredible, and I just wanted to let you know, let your listeners know that seeing it on the big screen is very awe-inspiring.
[00:55:45.772 --> 00:55:52.034]  What did you think of the two-hour plus film, Invisible Empire, that premiered yesterday at PrisonPlanet.tv?
[00:55:52.034 --> 00:55:52.574]  Oh, it was great!
[00:55:52.574 --> 00:55:58.436]  I mean, it was the same, it put your little part in there, but other than that, it was a great movie.
[00:55:58.436 --> 00:56:02.798]  And I thought, when I got home, I got to show my wife what was on the internet version of it.
[00:56:03.487 --> 00:56:07.852]  But seeing it at the premiere was great, more than anything else.
[00:56:07.852 --> 00:56:11.256]  What do you mean it put my little part in it?
[00:56:11.256 --> 00:56:16.141]  You had a little part there in the movie, online?
[00:56:16.141 --> 00:56:18.043]  Prison Planet.tv and Invisible Empire?
[00:56:18.043 --> 00:56:19.464]  Oh absolutely, in the middle of it.
[00:56:19.464 --> 00:56:22.268]  I stopped for a moment and asked people to purchase the DVD, sure.
[00:56:22.964 --> 00:56:25.387]  That part, yeah, that was great.
[00:56:25.387 --> 00:56:28.791]  It wasn't in the theatrical part of it.
[00:56:28.791 --> 00:56:29.172]  No, no.
[00:56:29.172 --> 00:56:34.438]  That we saw, but it was, you know, having your input in there was great.
[00:56:34.438 --> 00:56:39.284]  The internet version has a little call to action in the middle of it, yes.
[00:56:39.284 --> 00:56:40.986]  Different from what is on the DVD.
[00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:45.016]  I loved how George Bush, they had the extended version of George H.W.
[00:56:45.016 --> 00:56:51.358]  Bush's take on the New World Order, stuff that most people haven't really seen on the internet.
[00:56:51.358 --> 00:56:56.099]  A lot of that archived footage Burmese went to a lot of trouble to get has never been on the web before.
[00:56:56.099 --> 00:56:58.500]  A lot of the New World Order quotes have never been seen before.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:04.981]  A lot of the statements for global government have never been seen.
[00:57:04.981 --> 00:57:06.842]  They were seen on television at the time, but
[00:57:07.847 --> 00:57:13.189]  That was pre-internet, so it had never popularly been known.
[00:57:13.189 --> 00:57:13.749]  Exactly.
[00:57:13.749 --> 00:57:17.570]  And then they had the skull and bones rituals they caught on tape.
[00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:22.171]  That was outstanding to see that and how awe-inspiring it was to see that being exposed.
[00:57:22.171 --> 00:57:23.892]  It was just great.
[00:57:23.892 --> 00:57:25.712]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call, Fred.
[00:57:25.712 --> 00:57:26.432]  Good to hear from you.
[00:57:26.432 --> 00:57:28.313]  Charlie in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[00:57:28.313 --> 00:57:30.413]  Welcome.
[00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:30.994]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:30.994 --> 00:57:31.774]  You there?
[00:57:31.774 --> 00:57:32.834]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:32.834 --> 00:57:33.554]  Hey, buddy.
[00:57:33.554 --> 00:57:35.715]  I wanted to bring up two points.
[00:57:36.636 --> 00:57:39.920]  Uh, about the Tea Party, uh, movement, uh, yesterday.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:51.373]  I live here in Raleigh, and, uh, let's see, it was yesterday morning, my buddy picked me up for work, and he was all bent out of shape, saying, man, they're not gonna let him even have an American flag inside the thing.
[00:57:52.383 --> 00:57:57.406]  Inside the, I don't know where it was held, but it was held at the State Capitol, as a matter of fact.
[00:57:57.406 --> 00:58:17.099]  And there was something, I don't really know, I'm kind of asking you if you know about this, but there was the state police and somebody, the state something or other, were going to prohibit displaying American flags inside the Capitol grounds, which to me is just completely, I mean, I don't even need to say it.
[00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:18.080]  The other thing is you
[00:58:19.477 --> 00:58:24.700]  We're asking for people to call you about provocateurs.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.721]  Yes.
[00:58:25.721 --> 00:58:28.763]  I did not go down there, but I live close to where it is.
[00:58:28.763 --> 00:58:30.824]  I live in the downtown area.
[00:58:30.824 --> 00:58:33.446]  And I was out on the back porch working.
[00:58:33.446 --> 00:58:34.426]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:34.426 --> 00:58:37.148]  We're back seconds after this break.
[00:58:37.148 --> 00:58:42.511]  Charlie, you can finish up your point.
[00:58:42.511 --> 00:58:45.113]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.642]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[00:58:57.642 --> 00:58:58.523]  Okay.

[01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:17.412]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.412 --> 01:00:29.461]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.461 --> 01:00:31.322]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:31.322 --> 01:00:33.024]  Bob Chapman's coming up in the next hour.
[01:00:34.389 --> 01:00:44.780]  Coming up later in this hour, we're going to look at a massive miscarriage of justice, a very scary police state development here inside the United States, now headed to the Supreme Court.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.205]  But going back to Charlie, I'm opening the phones up to talk about provocateurs.
[01:00:50.447 --> 01:01:03.210]  And I have quite a few mainstream news articles here from all over the country showing anti-Tea Party people with Nazi signs, as they promised to do, showing up claiming they're with the Tea Party.
[01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:09.371]  Just despicable, despicable type activity going on on that front.
[01:01:09.371 --> 01:01:10.912]  But Charlie is in North Carolina.
[01:01:10.912 --> 01:01:13.272]  I was asking if he saw any provocateurs.
[01:01:13.272 --> 01:01:13.632]  Go ahead.
[01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:16.253]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[01:01:16.253 --> 01:01:16.633]  Yes, I can.
[01:01:17.415 --> 01:01:28.705]  Okay, so as I was saying, I didn't attend the tea party, but I live close by, and I was out on my back porch working, and four U.S.
[01:01:28.705 --> 01:01:44.558]  Marine Corps Warthog fighter planes flew in formation at approximately the height of your average news chopper would fly, flying pretty slow, and did a pass over downtown and I was
[01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:53.296]  Looking out, and as I caught, you know, as I caught him on the horizon, all four in formation made a sharp bank to the left.
[01:01:53.296 --> 01:01:59.060]  Flew off into the distance, and then about a minute or two later again, they came swooshing by, and we were right back over the Tea Party.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.484]  Well, they might have been doing that, they might have been doing that because they're fans of the Tea Party.
[01:02:03.484 --> 01:02:10.549]  Most of the military are good people, and our fans of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, they've sworn an oath to, and they might have been saluting it.
[01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:13.692]  I was wondering about that, I wanted your take on it, but I can tell you that it's
[01:02:14.793 --> 01:02:17.354]  It reminds me of back in NLE 09, man.
[01:02:17.354 --> 01:02:27.380]  There were 10 F-16s or 10 F-somethings flew over Raleigh, real low, real slow, in formation, and it was scary, man.
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.380]  That stuff is scary.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.462]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call, Charlie.
[01:02:30.462 --> 01:02:39.827]  During NLE 09, for those that don't know, you just search it in the term NLE, National Level Exercise 09, and the top link, at least the last time I checked, was FEMA.
[01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:41.230]  And
[01:02:56.192 --> 01:02:58.255]  Hey Alex, I did attend a local Naperville tea party here.
[01:03:14.774 --> 01:03:28.332]  And first off, I want to verify that Susan Carlson for CBS on the 11am news did try to divert people by saying that the Tea Party started at 1 instead of at noontime.
[01:03:29.275 --> 01:03:31.657]  I went there at noon.
[01:03:31.657 --> 01:03:40.143]  As soon as I walked up, I was yelled at because I was, you know, voicing my expression.
[01:03:40.143 --> 01:03:45.067]  And when I informed the crowd that I wasn't a tea partier, they said, well, what are you doing here then?
[01:03:45.067 --> 01:03:49.150]  And I said, I'm here to wake you folks up.
[01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:54.174]  There were probably about 20 to 30 freedom of speech signs.
[01:03:54.174 --> 01:03:56.216]  And when the speaker told a lie,
[01:03:56.904 --> 01:04:02.365]  And I acted like you, counteracting, you know, countering with the truth.
[01:04:02.365 --> 01:04:04.986]  They would all tell me to shut up.
[01:04:04.986 --> 01:04:06.967]  They'd turn around and tell me to shut up.
[01:04:06.967 --> 01:04:18.050]  I actually caught the police following me around and I came back with my friend and pointed them out and he said, yes, that's the person that was following you around.
[01:04:20.191 --> 01:04:28.700]  He told me that he even heard that over the police radio that the police were told to keep an eye on me.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.923]  Again, you weren't a Democrat showing up with swastika signs.
[01:04:31.923 --> 01:04:36.467]  You were a patriot trying to wake up the Tea Party that's being taken over by Republicans, correct?
[01:04:37.509 --> 01:04:41.493]  That is absolutely correct, but here's the real catch, Alex.
[01:04:41.493 --> 01:04:50.301]  One of the speakers said, we need to turn off state-run TV, turn off CBS, turn off NBC, turn off ABC.
[01:04:50.301 --> 01:04:53.605]  We want Fox News, and the whole crowd cheered.
[01:04:54.949 --> 01:05:00.531]  No, they're certainly trying to control the revolution by making it a Republican Fox News production.
[01:05:00.531 --> 01:05:05.814]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:05:05.814 --> 01:05:08.575]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:05:08.575 --> 01:05:13.077]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:05:13.917 --> 01:05:18.399]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[01:06:00.936 --> 01:06:03.938]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.938 --> 01:06:09.261]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.261 --> 01:06:11.323]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.323 --> 01:06:16.326]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.326 --> 01:06:17.507]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:18.627]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.627 --> 01:06:20.508]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.508 --> 01:06:21.589]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:23.790]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:25.131]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.131 --> 01:06:26.652]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.652 --> 01:06:27.693]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:29.194]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:31.916]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.916 --> 01:06:35.499]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.499 --> 01:06:39.321]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.321 --> 01:06:40.542]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.542 --> 01:06:41.443]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.443 --> 01:06:42.544]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.544 --> 01:06:43.304]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.304 --> 01:06:44.285]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:47.627]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:08.356]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:07:08.356 --> 01:07:12.858]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:07:12.858 --> 01:07:18.002]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:07:18.002 --> 01:07:25.486]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:07:25.486 --> 01:07:29.849]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.

[01:07:36.171 --> 01:07:43.114]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:06.987]  Big Brother.
[01:08:06.987 --> 01:08:08.748]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.748 --> 01:08:10.508]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.508 --> 01:08:12.109]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:13.650]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:17.852]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.852 --> 01:08:24.135]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.135 --> 01:08:25.536]  There isn't one faction.
[01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:26.777]  There's not two factions.
[01:08:26.777 --> 01:08:28.057]  There's not three factions.
[01:08:28.057 --> 01:08:29.718]  There's not four.
[01:08:29.718 --> 01:08:32.160]  There are hundreds of different factions.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:32.440]  Some
[01:08:33.962 --> 01:08:38.605]  Our dominant others are tiny, in the Tea Parties.
[01:08:38.605 --> 01:08:50.072]  But the mainstream media makes it look like there's Republicans and Fox News on one side, and Democrats and George Soros and Barack Obama on the other, against the Tea Parties.
[01:08:51.283 --> 01:08:58.868]  It's not only Democrats and government-funded so-called anarchists and police groups infiltrating the Tea Parties.
[01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:07.453]  They're infiltrating militias, pro-gun groups, property rights organizations, organizations that want to protect the border.
[01:09:07.453 --> 01:09:14.177]  That's come out in the news that they send provocateurs out to set people up and then lie about them to police to get them arrested.
[01:09:14.177 --> 01:09:16.318]  That's happened with the Minutemen and others.
[01:09:18.035 --> 01:09:21.076]  This is basically dirty tricks campaigns.
[01:09:21.076 --> 01:09:25.417]  You've got all these different factions running dirty tricks against each other.
[01:09:25.417 --> 01:09:29.818]  The Republicans haven't been doing it as much as the Democrats because they've got the high ground.
[01:09:29.818 --> 01:09:33.418]  They're playing the part of the anti-establishment right now.
[01:09:33.418 --> 01:09:34.739]  They're out of power.
[01:09:34.739 --> 01:09:37.259]  And so they can... We don't want the New World Order!
[01:09:37.259 --> 01:09:38.780]  We don't want the taxes!
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:40.100]  We don't want the health care!
[01:09:41.732 --> 01:09:50.017]  But they lie and say that health care is socialism and a rip-off and you can't give poor people something free.
[01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:51.358]  And that would be bad enough.
[01:09:51.358 --> 01:09:54.700]  I mean, that's partially true.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:59.003]  But you heard Lord Monckton yesterday.
[01:10:00.219 --> 01:10:01.139]  Quite a mind.
[01:10:01.139 --> 01:10:02.960]  You've heard Ron Paul.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:19.628]  You've heard many, many others who have accurately identified, as I've been doing from day one, and as Dennis Kucinich and Howard Dean did before they got bought off, that this makes 30-plus million people buy health care, and it lowers the standard of care, and the insurance companies wrote this.
[01:10:19.628 --> 01:10:20.788]  This is fascism.
[01:10:20.788 --> 01:10:23.389]  This is corporatism, if you want to give it a name.
[01:10:23.389 --> 01:10:24.250]  Ron Paul is right.
[01:10:25.509 --> 01:10:42.080]  And if we get that message out, then they can't play the left and right off against each other, then the left's gonna figure out it's a rip-off to the big corporations, the right's gonna start learning that big corporations are not perfect and run the New World Order and are bigger than most governments.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:54.068]  All I hear big right-wing talk show hosts doing is defending the insurance companies and blaming it all on the Democrats, when this is a systemic corruption across the board.
[01:10:56.770 --> 01:11:03.914]  And of course there's another big faction, Real Patriots, who founded the Tea Party conservatively in 2007.
[01:11:03.914 --> 01:11:09.096]  You got the Democrats, you got the Republicans and the Fox News group.
[01:11:09.096 --> 01:11:13.839]  You've got the other little factions that are hired by government and provocateured by government.
[01:11:13.839 --> 01:11:20.922]  You have the government operatives out there who put up websites and have a call to action and then get useful idiots to show up and bolster their numbers.
[01:11:20.922 --> 01:11:22.883]  But you've got the original Tea Partiers from 2007.
[01:11:24.861 --> 01:11:31.649]  Who are libertarians, constitutionalists, anti-war folks, populists, and they're the people going out and protesting everywhere.
[01:11:31.649 --> 01:11:33.131]  They're the people hitting the streets.
[01:11:33.131 --> 01:11:34.733]  They're the people getting angry.
[01:11:34.733 --> 01:11:43.984]  And so a year ago, Fox News comes in, advertises giant tea parties, gives it huge attention on talk radio and TV, gets their big speakers out.
[01:11:44.892 --> 01:11:53.561]  Then the left side of the fake media, in that paradigm, continuing the illusion, they come in and cover it as if it is a Republican event.
[01:11:53.561 --> 01:12:00.708]  That then brings more Republicans in who see the channels they hate, MSNBC, CNN, promoting it as a Republican event.
[01:12:00.708 --> 01:12:02.530]  They attack it as a Republican event.
[01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:06.995]  And so Republicans come out in force and take over the Tea Party that was there.
[01:12:08.342 --> 01:12:18.725]  And now here we are, a year and a few months later, 14, 15 months later, since the Republicans started taking over the Tea Party, and national polls show they have now done it.
[01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:32.748]  And whereas six months ago you could show up to a big Republican-run Tea Party and hand out Road to Tyranny, Endgame, Terror Storm, Loose Change, Final Cut, and you would be welcomed by many and only hissed at by a few, now you show up, they beat you up.
[01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.309]  Remember the Phoenix video a few weeks ago?
[01:12:35.109 --> 01:12:38.012]  The guy got up and said, look, Sarah Palin, you're for global warming.
[01:12:38.012 --> 01:12:40.354]  Republicans triple the size of government.
[01:12:40.354 --> 01:12:41.134]  What are you doing?
[01:12:41.134 --> 01:12:42.756]  John McCain's bad.
[01:12:42.756 --> 01:12:43.877]  We need to vote for J.D.
[01:12:43.877 --> 01:12:44.417]  Hayworth.
[01:12:44.417 --> 01:12:48.381]  He's not perfect, but he's got a much more conservative, libertarian voting record.
[01:12:48.381 --> 01:12:50.322]  They beat him up.
[01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:51.624]  The Tea Partiers beat him up.
[01:12:51.624 --> 01:12:54.066]  The cops came in and helped them beat him up and drag him off.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.181]  So, we started the Tea Parties.
[01:12:58.181 --> 01:13:04.444]  We were the first to recognize, as conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalists, that Bush was bad.
[01:13:04.444 --> 01:13:11.248]  Then Obama comes along and we're still there saying he's bad, and Republicans show up and say, you know what, we're going to beat the hell out of you.
[01:13:11.248 --> 01:13:12.348]  We're going to drag you out of here.
[01:13:12.348 --> 01:13:13.309]  We're going to shout you down.
[01:13:15.526 --> 01:13:19.291]  So the Republicans aren't provocateuring much or staging events.
[01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:21.775]  The Democrats are doing that because they're in power right now.
[01:13:21.775 --> 01:13:27.583]  What the Republicans are doing is strong-arming, just like Democratic Union thugs.
[01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:28.984]  Remember all that footage in the last year?
[01:13:28.984 --> 01:13:31.688]  The Republicans are doing the same thing.
[01:13:32.754 --> 01:13:34.315]  And it's shameful.
[01:13:34.315 --> 01:13:49.465]  And you sickening Republicans that are at these big tea parties, who hiss and yell at real patriots, and who go along with this, hey, you're going to get your pension fund taken, the Republicans led by Newt Gingrich are going to have a new contract with America, and they're going to sell you out, and you're going to love it.
[01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:51.606]  They're in a con you don't love.
[01:13:51.606 --> 01:13:54.067]  They're in a scam you don't buy into.
[01:13:54.067 --> 01:14:01.371]  You are just as stupid and mindless and wanting and weak as these foolish Democrat supporters.
[01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.192]  You make me want to throw up.
[01:14:03.192 --> 01:14:04.313]  You make me sick.
[01:14:06.792 --> 01:14:09.374]  You aren't real constitutionalist.
[01:14:09.374 --> 01:14:10.915]  You don't really care about the Republic.
[01:14:10.915 --> 01:14:17.280]  You love the Patriot Act and secret arrest and torture and illegal wars under Bush.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.482]  You love Bush with his amnesty plan.
[01:14:19.482 --> 01:14:21.023]  Why don't you love Obama?
[01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:22.984]  And I'll tell you Bush supporters something.
[01:14:22.984 --> 01:14:24.766]  You should love Obama.
[01:14:24.766 --> 01:14:27.848]  You should get on your knees and love him.
[01:14:27.848 --> 01:14:32.712]  Because he is taking everything Bush did and expanding it.
[01:14:32.712 --> 01:14:34.893]  It's shameful.
[01:14:34.893 --> 01:14:35.474]  It's shameful.
[01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:47.715]  The only thing more shameful are these Democratic Party operatives attacking their own offices, the Black Congressional Congress invoking the race card, lying about the N-word and being spit on.
[01:14:47.715 --> 01:14:56.356]  And I've got news reports all over the country saying there were people at the Tea Party with Nazi signs, reporting it like it was real.
[01:14:56.356 --> 01:15:06.058]  But I found a bunch of other alternative news reports that have video and photos, like this NewMexicoIndependent.com.
[01:15:07.165 --> 01:15:10.007]  They're pretty middle of the road, but they tell the truth.
[01:15:10.007 --> 01:15:13.991]  Santa Fe Tea Party event draws its own protesters.
[01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:19.055]  And remember the AP on Monday reporting what we talked about weeks ago.
[01:15:19.055 --> 01:15:26.622]  The big anarchist groups and others and Democratic Party operatives going out saying show up with racist signs and other things.
[01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:27.683]  Well, here it is.
[01:15:29.798 --> 01:15:44.804]  In this article from NewMexicoIndependent.com, it's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, Santa Fe Tea Party event draws its own protesters and it's got photos and video of signs that say, Nazi youth for lower taxes.
[01:15:44.804 --> 01:15:47.325]  Nazi youth for lower taxes.
[01:15:51.584 --> 01:16:08.599]  You've got these guys that look like they're no more than 17 years old, they don't have two brain cells between the two of them, they're dumber than a box of rocks, and they've been provocateured out there by the Democratic Party operatives online to act like complete jackasses.
[01:16:08.599 --> 01:16:11.562]  Just morons.
[01:16:11.562 --> 01:16:17.968]  And see, because the country's in trouble, you're gonna have a lot of people who've never been politically involved, who aren't savvy, being sucked in by all different angles.
[01:16:20.049 --> 01:16:24.211]  Fox News and Glenn Becker setting things up for Beck to run for president later.
[01:16:24.211 --> 01:16:28.713]  Setting him up as a messianic leader where everybody basically pledges allegiance to him.
[01:16:28.713 --> 01:16:31.214]  And he says a lot of things that are true but then mixes in lies.
[01:16:31.214 --> 01:16:33.295]  I mean, folks, this is sophisticated.
[01:16:33.295 --> 01:16:37.777]  And people need to get sophisticated fast.
[01:16:37.777 --> 01:16:40.178]  This is how the globalists have taken over hundreds of other countries.
[01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:41.339]  They know what they're doing.
[01:16:41.339 --> 01:16:44.060]  They know how to play us off against each other.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.360]  Let's talk to James in New York.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:45.901]  You're on the air.
[01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:46.441]  Go ahead, James.
[01:16:49.892 --> 01:16:52.154]  James, go ahead.
[01:16:52.154 --> 01:16:52.795]  Okay.
[01:16:52.795 --> 01:16:54.876]  Um, okay.
[01:16:54.876 --> 01:17:03.744]  My family and I are staying in a homeless shelter in New York and they recently came out with this program for charging the people in the homeless shelters for rent.
[01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:08.108]  Now, I don't disagree with it, but I disagree with the sliding scale.
[01:17:08.108 --> 01:17:12.272]  If somebody makes $10,000 a year, they are charged $36 a month to stay in the shelter.
[01:17:12.272 --> 01:17:12.512]  However,
[01:17:16.997 --> 01:17:17.117]  It's
[01:17:35.749 --> 01:17:38.192]  After taxes, it's actually 50.45% of the income.
[01:17:52.548 --> 01:17:56.152]  In New York, folks, a bottle of water is 3-4 bucks.
[01:17:56.152 --> 01:18:05.203]  You can't get a rat-infested apartment with cockroaches the size of chihuahuas and be able to buy food and even clothing or anything with $30,000.
[01:18:05.203 --> 01:18:09.367]  And so what's happening is, and look, this is how they've done it in other countries.
[01:18:09.367 --> 01:18:11.089]  They don't just say, we're throwing you in death camps.
[01:18:11.710 --> 01:18:13.312]  They destroy the economy by design.
[01:18:13.312 --> 01:18:17.717]  You've got tens of millions of homeless, a lot of them that were formerly middle class.
[01:18:17.717 --> 01:18:21.682]  They push you into these facilities and they say, you know what, we're having to pay for you.
[01:18:21.682 --> 01:18:22.843]  You've got to work.
[01:18:22.843 --> 01:18:28.890]  So the next thing is they're going to start ratcheting it up to 50 percent of the money if you're making a thousand dollars a year.
[01:18:29.791 --> 01:18:37.634]  I mean, it's not going to matter, and they're going to lawfully, under fake laws, California's already doing this, so is Hawaii, make you go to the shelters.
[01:18:37.634 --> 01:18:38.755]  You'll be locked up at night.
[01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:40.296]  It's the British model of the poorhouses.
[01:18:40.296 --> 01:18:41.456]  It's all been done before.
[01:18:41.456 --> 01:18:43.097]  Nothing new under the sun.
[01:18:43.097 --> 01:18:55.162]  And then you're just basically going to be prisoners as sharecroppers, whether it's making license plates or furniture or doing telemarketing, whatever it is, in these quasi-private government facilities.
[01:18:55.942 --> 01:19:02.448]  Just like they started the income tax at 1%, now it's upwards of 40 for some, under Obama's changes.
[01:19:02.448 --> 01:19:06.751]  They're starting off at this, and they're saying, hey, get a job.
[01:19:06.751 --> 01:19:11.616]  And the answer is, go west, young man, haven't you been told?
[01:19:11.616 --> 01:19:14.558]  California's full of whiskey, women, and gold.
[01:19:14.558 --> 01:19:19.142]  Well, you don't want to go to California, it's full of parasites and the state's collapsing.
[01:19:19.142 --> 01:19:21.104]  But come to Texas, okay?
[01:19:22.725 --> 01:19:28.407]  Come here, or go to Mississippi, or go somewhere where it's cheap to live, okay?
[01:19:28.407 --> 01:19:29.628]  I mean, get out of New York.
[01:19:29.628 --> 01:19:31.448]  Come on.
[01:19:31.448 --> 01:19:32.089]  True.
[01:19:32.089 --> 01:19:41.092]  But the thing is, I could see if it was a flat rate of maybe 10%, but this sliding scale of difference is a total and utter joke.
[01:19:41.092 --> 01:19:47.114]  Now, I'm going for something that's about $35,000 to $40,000 a year, so I got a real big question for these people.
[01:19:47.114 --> 01:19:48.655]  How much are they going to charge my butt?
[01:19:50.234 --> 01:19:50.916]  Absolutely.
[01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:55.304]  I mean, what do you gotta make, 40, 50 grand a year to basically even live in New York?

[01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:59.312]  It's sad to hear that, James.

[01:21:01.255 --> 01:21:07.939]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.939 --> 01:21:16.043]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:16.043 --> 01:21:24.207]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:24.207 --> 01:21:28.970]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:34.534]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.

[01:23:04.576 --> 01:23:08.760]  My name is Van, and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:13.505]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:23:13.505 --> 01:23:15.427]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:23:15.427 --> 01:23:17.309]  It made me feel breathless.
[01:23:17.309 --> 01:23:21.333]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:23:21.733 --> 01:23:22.774]  Nothing did anything.

[01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:11.292]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[01:24:11.292 --> 01:24:12.933]  Let's talk to Jim in Louisiana.
[01:24:12.933 --> 01:24:13.774]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:24:13.774 --> 01:24:14.514]  Welcome.
[01:24:14.514 --> 01:24:17.416]  Hey Alex, what's going on?
[01:24:17.416 --> 01:24:19.618]  Ah, worldwide broadcast, day after tax day.
[01:24:19.618 --> 01:24:21.039]  What's on your mind?
[01:24:21.039 --> 01:24:22.640]  Well, uh, two things.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:28.364]  I was at the Pea Party rally, covering that for my work, and uh, man, it's kind of like
[01:24:30.024 --> 01:24:36.309]  It's like the Republican Party, both neocons have stepped in there, and you've got people out there like the organizers.
[01:24:36.309 --> 01:24:40.733]  The guy I talked to, Mr. Tony D.R., he's got a really complicated last name.
[01:24:40.733 --> 01:24:43.956]  He lives in Bossier City, by the way, right outside of Shreveport.
[01:24:43.956 --> 01:24:45.317]  He's got his stuff together.
[01:24:45.317 --> 01:24:48.640]  I mean, he's talking about, you know, don't trust the two parties.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.304]  You know, you really need to look at their values and their, you know, their voting record.
[01:24:53.982 --> 01:24:59.246]  But you get out there and it's all, you know, Fox News support, you know, neoconservative.
[01:24:59.246 --> 01:25:00.186]  It's crazy.
[01:25:00.186 --> 01:25:02.248]  Oh, New Gettridge was in Austin yesterday.
[01:25:02.248 --> 01:25:06.370]  If I would have known, I would have gone down there and tried to, you know, confront him with serious questions.
[01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:09.132]  This is a guy that we're going to play that later.
[01:25:09.132 --> 01:25:16.137]  This is a guy who's out promoting global warming taxes and still defending it and calls for global government.
[01:25:16.137 --> 01:25:18.478]  I mean, he is just horrible.
[01:25:18.478 --> 01:25:23.382]  He let the Republican take over a 94 down a rat hole and he's doing it again.
[01:25:24.182 --> 01:25:32.148]  I mean, it's just, he is a high-level CFR, globalist operative, at the same level as Obama.
[01:25:32.148 --> 01:25:35.270]  He's intimately involved with PNAC and the neocons at 9-11.
[01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:36.531]  He is a monster!
[01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:37.652]  A monster!
[01:25:40.174 --> 01:25:46.797]  And, you know, here are the Republicans just praising him and pledging that they're not going to be too radical for states' rights.
[01:25:46.797 --> 01:25:48.318]  That was in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:25:48.318 --> 01:25:51.520]  Just flagellating themselves with bull whips.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.782]  You know, apologizing for themselves and basically urinating down their own legs.
[01:25:55.782 --> 01:25:57.823]  And, you know, they're all wearing big diapers.
[01:25:57.823 --> 01:26:00.504]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[01:26:00.504 --> 01:26:00.884]  It is.
[01:26:00.884 --> 01:26:01.824]  It really is.
[01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:05.266]  And the sad part is there are people in that crowd who are in the know.
[01:26:05.266 --> 01:26:06.967]  And when these public speakers come on,
[01:26:07.509 --> 01:26:11.613]  Who are using the Bible to support neoconservative ideas.
[01:26:11.613 --> 01:26:14.576]  They're not preaching it, they're using it, which is sad.
[01:26:14.576 --> 01:26:19.680]  It's kind of like you just see their heads go down in disdain and utter shame about it.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:25.346]  And it's something that, you know, I can't stand because it's... I don't know, it's gotten to the point where you just say,
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:28.882]  You know, Bush's policies led us in here.
[01:26:28.882 --> 01:26:31.003]  Barack Obama just ran with it.
[01:26:31.003 --> 01:26:34.426]  He's doing nothing but push, you know, Bush's policies.
[01:26:34.426 --> 01:26:36.048]  And it's kind of like no one's acknowledging that.
[01:26:36.048 --> 01:26:38.429]  They're like, yeah, give us the old guy back, you know.
[01:26:38.429 --> 01:26:40.651]  It gets annoying.
[01:26:40.651 --> 01:26:48.197]  And the second thing I called about was I was driving into work from Natchitoches and there was a narco point.
[01:26:48.197 --> 01:26:50.439]  I kid you not, right before the Carmel exit.
[01:26:50.439 --> 01:26:51.060]  It was crazy.
[01:26:53.268 --> 01:26:55.750]  All right, my friend, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:57.352]  And I said flagellate.
[01:26:57.352 --> 01:26:58.212]  That's a different definition.
[01:26:58.212 --> 01:27:03.817]  I meant flagellation or flogging in the act of methodically beating or whipping.
[01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:05.658]  Let's see what flagellate means.
[01:27:05.658 --> 01:27:07.440]  I think that means something bad.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:17.568]  I got a big vocabulary, but sometimes... No, it's... Flagellates are organisms with one or more whip-like cells.
[01:27:17.568 --> 01:27:20.931]  So I guess it's a type of coral or something, or green algae.
[01:27:20.931 --> 01:27:21.552]  Okay, there we go.
[01:27:24.817 --> 01:27:45.293]  I love words, I'm obsessed with words, and my point is you've got the Republicans beating themselves over the head, promising to not be too extreme, while the establishment sits there and attempts to make everybody just be very tame, and go under the control of the Republican Party, and keep our mouths shut, and they'll save us, sure they will.
[01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:48.696]  Bill in South Carolina, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:52.419]  Yeah, greetings and salutations, Alex, from the Holy City.
[01:27:52.419 --> 01:27:52.840]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:54.318 --> 01:28:12.789]  Yeah, um, we had ourselves a very, uh, eventful, uh, tea party, uh, gathering down here on the steps of the Customs House, right off from the, uh, shores of, uh, the little island of Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired.
[01:28:12.789 --> 01:28:20.074]  And, uh, it's got something of a real patriarchy to me, and that is that, uh, there were a lot of folks here that were, uh,
[01:28:22.415 --> 01:28:23.155]  Independence.
[01:28:23.155 --> 01:28:28.397]  I didn't see anybody flashing no Nazi signs or any of that stuff.
[01:28:28.397 --> 01:28:29.598]  All these people were Independents.
[01:28:29.598 --> 01:28:39.962]  Republicans, fortunately, hadn't come down and taken over the meeting because everybody, for the most part, was talking simple fact that we are being taxed enough.
[01:28:39.962 --> 01:28:43.783]  And we had people from the Fair Tax people come out and talk.
[01:28:43.783 --> 01:28:48.705]  We had people everywhere, you know, flashing their billboard signs and
[01:28:49.844 --> 01:28:54.012]  We had a black man, a conservative black man, get up in front of everybody and talk.
[01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:02.711]  Well, that's what the media does.
[01:29:02.711 --> 01:29:06.894]  The media for the last year and a half saying it's racist.
[01:29:06.894 --> 01:29:11.718]  That's meant to scare black people from coming to the event so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:29:11.718 --> 01:29:13.279]  They want us at each other's throats.
[01:29:13.279 --> 01:29:16.041]  Again, that's why this race pimping is so evil.
[01:29:16.041 --> 01:29:17.102]  They are the racists.
[01:29:17.102 --> 01:29:23.227]  The media is dividing and conquering and invoking this to keep us divided as an American people.
[01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:29.893]  Oh yeah, because if we stay divided, we'll never get together and find out who the real enemy is and throw him out.
[01:29:29.893 --> 01:29:43.216]  That's why it's so outrageous, Bill, to watch the media say that everyone at the Tea Parties are basically racist and then dispatch their own Democratic Party operatives with N-word and swastika signs.
[01:29:43.216 --> 01:29:44.016]  It's illegal.
[01:29:44.016 --> 01:29:44.616]  It's criminal.
[01:29:44.616 --> 01:29:45.656]  It's a frame-up.
[01:29:45.656 --> 01:29:46.837]  It's racketeering.
[01:29:46.837 --> 01:29:47.537]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:47.537 --> 01:29:47.917]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.201 --> 01:29:54.209]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.209 --> 01:29:57.819]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:10.314]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:30:10.314 --> 01:30:21.221]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:30:21.221 --> 01:30:26.645]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:30:27.185 --> 01:30:32.088]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:30:32.088 --> 01:30:41.152]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:30:41.152 --> 01:30:51.277]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:30:51.277 --> 01:30:54.939]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:30:54.939 --> 01:30:55.980]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:31:00.492 --> 01:31:01.792]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.792 --> 01:31:07.374]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.374 --> 01:31:12.396]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.396 --> 01:31:17.978]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:17.978 --> 01:31:23.200]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.081]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:31:25.501 --> 01:31:30.302]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.302 --> 01:31:31.423]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:31.423 --> 01:31:34.503]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:34.503 --> 01:31:38.124]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:38.124 --> 01:31:41.305]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:41.305 --> 01:31:43.526]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:43.526 --> 01:31:44.466]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:44.646]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:52.328 --> 01:31:57.150]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:57.150 --> 01:32:00.572]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:00.572 --> 01:32:07.235]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:07.235 --> 01:32:12.358]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.358 --> 01:32:18.761]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset cheese.
[01:32:21.107 --> 01:32:27.496]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:34.173]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:32:34.173 --> 01:32:38.014]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:32:38.014 --> 01:32:39.255]  Others don't.
[01:32:39.255 --> 01:32:41.396]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:41.396 --> 01:32:43.177]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:43.177 --> 01:32:46.058]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:46.058 --> 01:32:50.139]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:32:50.139 --> 01:32:52.700]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:55.401]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:55.401 --> 01:32:57.762]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:32:57.762 --> 01:32:58.263]  Others don't.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:04.881]  This is the beginning of what happens when you lose a democracy.
[01:33:04.881 --> 01:33:08.442]  Richard Fein is an accomplished attorney who holds a Ph.D.
[01:33:08.442 --> 01:33:15.463]  in international law and was an antitrust attorney with the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.
[01:33:15.463 --> 01:33:28.226]  He is sounding the clarion call from his cell in the Los Angeles County Central Men's Jail, where he is being held without trial, without bail, without an attorney, and with every appeal denied.
[01:33:29.082 --> 01:33:31.804]  Oh, there's absolutely no question that I'm a political prisoner.
[01:33:31.804 --> 01:33:43.912]  I mean, none whatsoever, because the political circumstance that has created this situation is that you have a straight out and out abuse of power that is taking place here.
[01:33:47.239 --> 01:33:49.361]  Okay, we got Bob Chapman coming up.
[01:33:49.361 --> 01:33:50.922]  Your phone calls in the next hour.
[01:33:50.922 --> 01:33:53.144]  A bunch of important news I want to get to.
[01:33:53.144 --> 01:33:58.189]  Homegrown solo terrorist as bad as Al-Qaeda, FBI chief says.
[01:33:58.189 --> 01:34:01.752]  So they're really getting ready to use homeland security against the American people.
[01:34:01.752 --> 01:34:03.193]  That's what it was originally set up for.
[01:34:03.193 --> 01:34:06.676]  That's what Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act states.
[01:34:06.676 --> 01:34:11.741]  All misdemeanors are basically acts of terrorism and all of your rights are stripped.
[01:34:12.401 --> 01:34:15.242]  So there's no doubt we're going deep into tyranny right now.
[01:34:15.242 --> 01:34:22.024]  They have the Belligerent Act, where citizens can be secretly arrested by the military, given enhanced interrogation, i.e.
[01:34:22.024 --> 01:34:23.324]  torture.
[01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:33.848]  But this case is going before the Supreme Court in their conference committee next Friday, and they're looking at actually hearing the full case.
[01:34:33.848 --> 01:34:37.709]  So this has now gone to the Supreme Court.
[01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:41.210]  So it's gone directly from a lower court in California,
[01:34:42.975 --> 01:34:57.846]  All the way to the Supreme Court, not going through the other courts in between, because the judge has not recused himself and is holding this gentleman as a political prisoner, Richard Fine.
[01:34:57.846 --> 01:35:04.391]  And you can read the story at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Daily News has the headline, Supreme Court to Hear Fine Case.
[01:35:05.151 --> 01:35:05.371]  I think?
[01:35:21.016 --> 01:35:35.128]  Advocate for justice and freedom, Leslie Dutton, is a civic activist and former account executive and vice president of a national public government affairs firms, represents diverse clients relating to the media, the U.S.
[01:35:35.128 --> 01:35:37.590]  Congress, and the California State Legislature.
[01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:40.352]  As a founding president of the American Association of Women, Ms.
[01:35:40.352 --> 01:35:46.878]  Dutton also spearheaded issue-oriented campaigns ranging from community charter amendments to University of California tuition policies
[01:35:47.538 --> 01:35:56.621]  As producer for the Full Disclosure Network, she has received a 2001 Emmy for Public Affairs Programming from the Academy of Television and Arts and Sciences.
[01:35:56.621 --> 01:36:00.722]  And we're very honored to have her with us.
[01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:06.604]  I mean, this case is like something out of Kafka or 1984, but it's happening in America.
[01:36:06.604 --> 01:36:08.264]  And we see this more and more.
[01:36:08.264 --> 01:36:10.225]  This is not the only case like this I've seen.
[01:36:11.505 --> 01:36:19.808]  But she joins us now to break down and it looks like we're going to have Mr. Fine on for 30 minutes or so in the last hour.
[01:36:19.808 --> 01:36:31.592]  So this will be a bifurcated or divided interview in this hour and then coming up the next hour we're going to try to talk from his jail cell if he can get through on the phone from his jail cell.
[01:36:31.592 --> 01:36:34.674]  But Leslie Dutton, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:36:34.674 --> 01:36:35.454]  You're welcome, Alec.
[01:36:36.147 --> 01:36:37.968]  Okay, a lot of people aren't aware of this case.
[01:36:37.968 --> 01:36:43.469]  Recap the basics of what's going on and how outrageous this is and where this is going.
[01:36:43.469 --> 01:36:48.390]  Well, it's outrageous because we don't hear about cases like this very often.
[01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:50.851]  The media keeps us in the dark.
[01:36:50.851 --> 01:36:55.773]  But Mr. Fine's case is unusual in the sense that he has drawn the line.
[01:36:55.773 --> 01:37:00.154]  He refused to obey a judge's illegal order.
[01:37:00.154 --> 01:37:00.614]  A judge
[01:37:01.092 --> 01:37:08.274]  Who should have recused himself because he accepts illegal payments from a party in the case before him.
[01:37:08.274 --> 01:37:09.614]  That party was the L.A.
[01:37:09.614 --> 01:37:10.674]  County.
[01:37:10.674 --> 01:37:17.976]  And the county has been paying the judges here in the county for 25 years.
[01:37:17.976 --> 01:37:19.076]  Illegally.
[01:37:19.076 --> 01:37:22.697]  And there was a court case called Sturgeon v. the County of L.A.
[01:37:22.697 --> 01:37:27.778]  that the appellate court held that those payments were illegal because the judges work for the state.
[01:37:28.348 --> 01:37:31.971]  And the county is one of the biggest litigants in the county.
[01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:44.082]  So it is very hard to, it isn't hard to understand when Mr. Fine just tells us that by their own admission, the county has never lost a case except for three.
[01:37:44.082 --> 01:37:51.029]  So the county is looking at this like risk management, paying off the judges according to Mr. Fine.
[01:37:51.029 --> 01:37:54.632]  But what he did was rather than obey the judge's illegal order,
[01:37:55.586 --> 01:38:05.872]  And the judge ordered him to pay $47,000, which he didn't have, to the county to cover the cost of an illegal, of an EIR report.
[01:38:05.872 --> 01:38:09.595]  That's an environmental impact report on a development.
[01:38:09.595 --> 01:38:15.098]  But Mr. Fine is sitting in jail because he refuses to cave in to the corruption.
[01:38:15.098 --> 01:38:22.823]  And I have to tell you, the Full Disclosure Network has been covering this since the day before he was arrested when we interviewed him.
[01:38:22.823 --> 01:38:24.464]  He knew what he was getting into.
[01:38:24.997 --> 01:38:28.599]  But he didn't realize how bad the situation was.
[01:38:28.599 --> 01:38:42.245]  And what he's done in all the courts that he has filed from his jail cell, his appeals, his writ of habeas corpus, his motions and so forth, is that he has documented everything that is happening.
[01:38:42.245 --> 01:38:45.867]  The courts, when they responded, they violated every rule.
[01:38:46.576 --> 01:38:52.061]  They ignored his rights and due process and they covered for each other.
[01:38:52.061 --> 01:38:54.463]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.710]  No, he has a Ph.D.
[01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:03.210]  in International Law.
[01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:05.892]  He was an antitrust prosecutor for the Department of Justice in Washington.
[01:39:27.001 --> 01:39:35.469]  But it was when his career became so successful as a consumer and taxpayer's advocate that he ran into trouble.
[01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:37.931]  And he had great success outside of L.A.
[01:39:37.931 --> 01:39:38.631]  County.
[01:39:38.631 --> 01:39:39.352]  But in L.A.
[01:39:39.352 --> 01:39:50.341]  County, he found, as he described it, that corruption was so bad that there wasn't a fair shake in the courts and that the people were not getting a fair shake.
[01:39:50.341 --> 01:39:51.502]  And he had had it.
[01:39:51.502 --> 01:39:52.363]  He just decided
[01:39:52.809 --> 01:39:56.545]  It was time to draw the line and clean up the corruption in the court.
[01:39:58.308 --> 01:40:18.172]  Well, we've seen the case in Pennsylvania and there's been other cases where it's admitted and judges have now been indicted for getting, what, two judges $2.6 million to take innocent kids and put them in a private juvenile lockup and the company that ran that was secretly paying the judges to put innocent people in jail.
[01:40:18.172 --> 01:40:24.493]  So we know that Mr. Fine's case and this case in Pennsylvania and others are just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:40:25.011 --> 01:40:32.235]  Well, you really put it very well, because since the full disclosure started covering this, we had no idea how bad it was.
[01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:53.728]  It appears that the courts are the beneficiaries of many fees, and they gain money by the manner in which they handle the cases, whether it be child custody cases, whether it be environmental impact, but there is a monetary incentive for judges who benefit from the decisions they make.
[01:40:54.378 --> 01:40:56.440]  And there's no oversight.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:04.145]  Although the presiding judges should be checking, there should be a checks and balances, but it's certainly not working here.
[01:41:04.145 --> 01:41:09.869]  And since we started doing this, people have been coming out of the woodwork to share other horror stories.
[01:41:09.869 --> 01:41:13.892]  And Mr. Fine has dug his heels in and said it's time to clean it up.
[01:41:16.050 --> 01:41:20.394]  Okay, I want to show people a document cam shot who are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:41:20.394 --> 01:41:44.453]  If you're a radio listener, you'll want to search the term, two judges plead guilty in sending kids to lock up, pair accused of taking $2.6 million in payoffs to put away young offenders, two Pennsylvania judges charged with taking millions of dollars in kickbacks to send youth offenders to privately run detention centers plead guilty to fraud Thursday in one of the most stunning cases of judicial corruption on record.
[01:41:45.936 --> 01:42:03.971]  The inside scoop I've got from former and current FBI, federal marshals, especially here in Texas, most of these small towns, in fact I've seen it on CNN where they get the local judge on to admit, yeah I'm getting part of the money from what we take, and they just pull families over, take their wallets.
[01:42:03.971 --> 01:42:10.095]  So people hearing this are saying, you mean on record in LA County,
[01:42:11.537 --> 01:42:18.439]  The judges are getting money, and specifically in this case, how was this discovered, and how much money?
[01:42:18.439 --> 01:42:27.341]  Because this isn't legal, obviously, and then somebody sues over it, and they get locked up by the very judge who's in trouble.
[01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:34.864]  Well, the judges were, the courts were warned before they started giving the money illegally.
[01:42:34.864 --> 01:42:40.105]  The Attorney General wrote an opinion, and sent it to the Superior Court, Court of the Court,
[01:42:50.069 --> 01:42:51.010]  Let me stop you again.
[01:42:51.010 --> 01:42:51.791]  Let me stop you again.
[01:42:51.791 --> 01:43:01.937]  This is like Philadelphia again, where the schools are given federally paid for laptops, they're watching the kids at home, and the schools are the one that told the public they were watching kids in their bedroom.
[01:43:01.937 --> 01:43:03.418]  In fact, let's pull that photo up.
[01:43:03.418 --> 01:43:08.602]  And my point is, tying this in, is that in one state you go to prison for this,
[01:43:09.262 --> 01:43:13.344]  And the Attorney General in California says this is illegal, and they just say we don't care.
[01:43:13.344 --> 01:43:16.645]  I mean, this is a new level of brazen corruption.
[01:43:16.645 --> 01:43:19.105]  Well, without a doubt, that's what it is.
[01:43:19.105 --> 01:43:21.966]  And here's the real kicker.
[01:43:21.966 --> 01:43:34.751]  When it became public that those payments were illegal after the Judicial Watch organization won their lawsuit challenging the payments, and the appellate court found them illegal, the Judicial Council went to the
[01:43:35.293 --> 01:43:59.046]  Daryl Steinberg, the leader of the state legislature, put through, very quietly, during the height of the budget crisis last year, a provision, a bill, Senate Bill SBX211, that gave the judges and the government officials involved in the illegal payment scheme retroactive criminal and civil immunity from prosecution.
[01:43:59.921 --> 01:44:06.166]  And to this day, no mainstream media in this state has reported that.
[01:44:06.166 --> 01:44:06.966]  Well, you know why?
[01:44:06.966 --> 01:44:14.031]  Because I guarantee you it's going on in every major city and many small towns and they know this can bring their whole corrupt system down.
[01:44:14.031 --> 01:44:20.856]  So, why doesn't Pennsylvania just pass a law saying judges can be given $2.6 million under the table?
[01:44:20.856 --> 01:44:22.437]  I mean, this is incredible!
[01:44:22.437 --> 01:44:26.440]  And as you said, there's almost a complete mainstream media blackout on this.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.681]  That's true.
[01:44:27.681 --> 01:44:28.622]  But you know what, Alex?
[01:44:29.224 --> 01:44:30.805]  Not to despair.
[01:44:30.805 --> 01:44:31.906]  There is hope.
[01:44:31.906 --> 01:44:34.868]  Because judges are elected officials.
[01:44:34.868 --> 01:44:38.391]  And they have to stand for confirmation once they're appointed.
[01:44:38.391 --> 01:44:41.173]  They have to stand for confirmation every six years.
[01:44:41.173 --> 01:44:42.914]  And they can be voted out.
[01:44:42.914 --> 01:44:54.022]  And it's time that the people wake up and realize that the arrogance that's demonstrated here, that they have the power to control the legislature, the governor.
[01:44:54.022 --> 01:44:54.843]  They have the power.
[01:44:54.843 --> 01:44:56.484]  Well, look what happened with us!
[01:44:57.990 --> 01:45:09.554]  We tried for a year to get into the jail to interview Mr. Fine, to see how he was doing his health, because he is 70 years old, and the sheriff repeatedly denied us.
[01:45:09.554 --> 01:45:14.836]  But, they let the LA Times come in and interview him.
[01:45:14.836 --> 01:45:21.558]  Of course, the LA Times report was very, very scant in detail, but we had to file a lawsuit
[01:45:22.011 --> 01:45:31.897]  To get access to speak with him and for you to see him on your website and hear his words.
[01:45:31.897 --> 01:45:38.321]  The Judicial Watch organization filed a lawsuit on our behalf and 30 days later the sheriff caved in.
[01:45:38.321 --> 01:45:43.444]  And I have to tell you, we really feel very grateful that we got that opportunity.
[01:45:43.444 --> 01:45:45.565]  Worried not for that.
[01:45:45.565 --> 01:45:51.689]  I really worry what would be happening to Mr. Fine right now and how many others there are in jail.
[01:45:52.202 --> 01:45:56.243]  Well, let me be clear.
[01:45:56.243 --> 01:46:01.865]  Judicial Watch, you judge a tree by its fruits, and they just continue to do a great job on so many fronts.
[01:46:01.865 --> 01:46:10.248]  It was Judicial Watch three years ago that sued and got the four-year documents that the government wouldn't release on the North American Union SPP meeting that I put in my film, Endgame.
[01:46:10.248 --> 01:46:13.029]  So, folks really need to support Judicial Watch.
[01:46:13.029 --> 01:46:14.210]  I just continue, over the years,
[01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:18.353]  To see them do such important work, but I mean, that's a whole other issue.
[01:46:18.353 --> 01:46:28.723]  Not only is this corruption now just out in the open and being left alone, and there's this media blockade on it, but he's been in jail for more than a year on contempt.
[01:46:28.723 --> 01:46:40.033]  Potentially, I guess, if this precedent is set judicially, then you can have local judges putting people behind bars for their entire life without ever even having a trial.
[01:46:40.433 --> 01:47:06.544]  But what's really interesting is the fact that what they're doing is in violation of the Supreme Court precedent set in 1974 when the reporter William Farr of the Los Angeles Times was held in contempt and he was held for 47 days and he finally got to the Supreme Court with his appeal and the court held that since the penal code says that if you hold someone
[01:47:07.003 --> 01:47:10.324]  More than five days in coercive confinement.
[01:47:10.324 --> 01:47:13.804]  It becomes penal for civil contempt.
[01:47:13.804 --> 01:47:15.745]  And that they cannot do that.
[01:47:15.745 --> 01:47:23.406]  In Mr. Fine's case, every single court, from all the way up to California, through the U.S.
[01:47:23.406 --> 01:47:33.068]  District Court, to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, has ignored the Supreme Court President, including Justice Kennedy.
[01:47:33.068 --> 01:47:36.589]  Mr. Fine made a personal application to Justice Kennedy
[01:47:37.336 --> 01:47:45.486]  Asking him for a stay of execution, which is kind of ironic because he's never been convicted or tried or even charged with a crime.
[01:47:46.518 --> 01:47:51.199]  But Kennedy just summarily denied it without comment and without signature.
[01:47:51.199 --> 01:47:58.621]  Well that's because they're creating this extrajudicial precedent under the Military Commissions Act and the rest of it.
[01:47:58.621 --> 01:48:05.743]  And now they've got the Belligerent Act in the Senate introduced by McCain and by Lindsey Graham.
[01:48:07.791 --> 01:48:17.636]  It says right there that the president or his designates for any reason including intelligence gathering can arrest and interrogate and hold indefinitely U.S.
[01:48:17.636 --> 01:48:22.039]  citizens and that only an act of Congress can have them be released.
[01:48:22.039 --> 01:48:28.122]  I mean, so they're moving towards abolishing the writ of habeas corpus.
[01:48:28.122 --> 01:48:33.545]  It would appear that way, but this is what they're doing now, law or not.
[01:48:33.545 --> 01:48:34.826]  This is actual practice.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:43.524]  Just like they spied on us for decades without warrants, then they got caught, they retroactively go have Congress pass a law.
[01:48:43.524 --> 01:48:44.585]  My God.
[01:48:44.585 --> 01:48:49.107]  Well, again, why was the judge so brazen?
[01:48:49.107 --> 01:48:55.451]  I mean, they had defeated his suit because of their corruption, and then now they wanted to punish him with $47,000.
[01:48:55.451 --> 01:48:59.013]  This is not the British system where in most cases you don't have to pay the
[01:49:01.194 --> 01:49:04.816]  The attorney's fees, unless it's found to be frivolous, this clearly isn't.
[01:49:04.816 --> 01:49:08.037]  And the judge just says, that's it, go to the dungeon.
[01:49:08.037 --> 01:49:10.658]  Yes, well, this is revenge.
[01:49:10.658 --> 01:49:14.279]  He has embarrassed the judges, he's exposed them.
[01:49:14.279 --> 01:49:20.682]  And they need to be exposed, really, because we have a right to know how the system works or doesn't work.
[01:49:20.682 --> 01:49:22.422]  But they don't like that.
[01:49:22.422 --> 01:49:24.663]  And they have the power to do it.
[01:49:24.663 --> 01:49:28.765]  And the other judges are apparently backing them up all the way to the Supreme Court.
[01:49:29.761 --> 01:49:31.442]  There is a glimmer of hope.
[01:49:31.442 --> 01:49:38.728]  The fact that Justice Ginsburg has scheduled this for the conference hearing on the 23rd is a good sign.
[01:49:38.728 --> 01:49:41.571]  It doesn't mean necessarily it's going to be heard.
[01:49:41.571 --> 01:49:46.995]  They will decide and vote as to whether or not they're going to take it up.
[01:49:46.995 --> 01:49:55.182]  And some experts believe that there's a good chance that they will decide to do this because of the Supreme Court precedent in the Farr case
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:50:03.265]  And the underlying issue, which is corruption and bribes being taken by the judges.
[01:50:03.265 --> 01:50:08.089]  And a quietly passed law giving him immunity from bribery.
[01:50:08.089 --> 01:50:10.611]  That has yet to be completely resolved.
[01:50:10.611 --> 01:50:15.434]  And let me tell you, once again, Judicial Watch is doing a yeoman's job.
[01:50:15.434 --> 01:50:24.721]  They are still fighting off continuing challenges from the Superior Court, trying to nullify the victory that they got.
[01:50:25.297 --> 01:50:27.918]  Uh, declaring those payments illegal.
[01:50:27.918 --> 01:50:33.060]  Uh, they're back in another, uh, appellate court hearing probably this July.
[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:43.784]  And at that time, it is possible that the issue of the illegality of a retroactive law to bestow a criminal immunity on the judges could be thrown out.
[01:50:44.969 --> 01:50:47.513]  Okay, Leslie Dutton, amazing information.
[01:50:47.513 --> 01:50:48.054]  Stay there.
[01:50:48.054 --> 01:50:53.141]  Let's talk about how we get justice here because we all hang together or we hang separate.
[01:50:53.141 --> 01:50:56.246]  The foundation of our republic is habeas corpus.
[01:50:56.246 --> 01:50:59.551]  I mean, this is a total tyranny of the stands.
[01:50:59.551 --> 01:51:00.211]  None of us are safe.
[01:51:01.607 --> 01:51:01.948]  Fact.
[01:51:01.948 --> 01:51:03.550]  4 million people in the U.S.
[01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:05.673]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[01:51:05.673 --> 01:51:06.193]  Fact.
[01:51:06.193 --> 01:51:09.878]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[01:51:09.878 --> 01:51:10.499]  Fact.
[01:51:10.499 --> 01:51:16.006]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[01:51:16.006 --> 01:51:16.287]  Fact.
[01:51:16.627 --> 01:51:20.812]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[01:51:20.812 --> 01:51:25.378]  Fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[01:52:01.129 --> 01:52:02.430]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:08.015]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.015 --> 01:52:13.040]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:18.065]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.605 --> 01:52:23.829]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.829 --> 01:52:26.151]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:26.151 --> 01:52:30.955]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.955 --> 01:52:32.076]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.076 --> 01:52:34.838]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.838 --> 01:52:38.761]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.761 --> 01:52:41.943]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.943 --> 01:52:43.765]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:44.145 --> 01:52:47.407]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:47.407 --> 01:52:50.168]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:50.168 --> 01:52:57.792]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.792 --> 01:53:00.193]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.061 --> 01:53:04.623]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:53:04.623 --> 01:53:06.904]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:53:06.904 --> 01:53:07.764]  Don't!
[01:53:07.764 --> 01:53:11.206]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:53:11.206 --> 01:53:18.329]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:53:18.309 --> 01:53:20.310]  's number one debt secret.
[01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:24.391]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:53:24.391 --> 01:53:27.073]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:53:28.654 --> 01:53:34.898]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:53:34.898 --> 01:53:36.059]  Herb K. was right.
[01:53:36.059 --> 01:53:39.282]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:53:39.282 --> 01:53:40.703]  What have you got to lose?
[01:53:40.703 --> 01:53:44.005]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:53:44.005 --> 01:53:44.686]  Get Herb K.'
[01:53:44.666 --> 01:53:47.248]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:53:47.248 --> 01:53:47.908]  Call 800-822-1291.
[01:53:47.908 --> 01:53:48.348]  That's 800-822-1291.
[01:53:57.505 --> 01:54:21.323]  800-822-1291 Prosecutors in Pennsylvania described a scheme in which the judges shut down the county-owned juvenile detention center in 2002 and signed an agreement with PA Child Care LLC to send youth offenders to its new facility outside
[01:54:22.642 --> 01:54:24.363]  Wilkes-Barre.
[01:54:24.363 --> 01:54:30.889]  In exchange, they were paid under the table, the two judges, $2.6 million in the following five years.
[01:54:30.889 --> 01:54:32.850]  Again.
[01:54:32.850 --> 01:54:35.032]  And this is going on everywhere.
[01:54:35.032 --> 01:54:40.517]  And in California, they're just coming right out in the open with it and saying, yeah, we're going to get some cash.
[01:54:40.517 --> 01:54:42.558]  We're going to take cash for how we rule.
[01:54:42.558 --> 01:54:43.619]  What's wrong with that?
[01:54:43.619 --> 01:54:45.441]  We've got SWAT teams if you don't like it.
[01:54:45.441 --> 01:54:46.522]  We'll throw you in the jail.
[01:54:47.523 --> 01:54:53.466]  Now, if this is allowed to continue, because, I mean, again, in the past when this stuff would come out, people went to prison.
[01:54:53.466 --> 01:54:55.086]  Now, you expose it!
[01:54:55.086 --> 01:55:01.349]  You go to prison without a trial from the very judge that you're exposing.
[01:55:01.349 --> 01:55:04.551]  Leslie Dutton, what do we do to help Richard Fine?
[01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:05.271]  What do we do?
[01:55:05.271 --> 01:55:15.315]  I mean, obviously, get the word out about this, have people visit your website, get the videos out to people, you know, call the Supreme Court, call the media, ask them, why aren't you covering this more?
[01:55:15.315 --> 01:55:16.176]  None of us are safe.
[01:55:16.715 --> 01:55:22.797]  Well, there's something very specific they can do next Tuesday, and it's really important.
[01:55:22.797 --> 01:55:28.158]  There's going to be two rallies to support the Free Richard Fine Movement.
[01:55:28.158 --> 01:55:33.739]  And one is going to be in front of the Superior Court in Los Angeles at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[01:55:33.739 --> 01:55:36.840]  The other one's going to be held in front of the steps at the U.S.
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:38.420]  Supreme Court.
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:44.242]  And grassroots citizens are urged to turn out, bring a sign,
[01:55:45.347 --> 01:55:51.151]  And the one before the Supreme Court will start at 11 a.m.
[01:55:51.151 --> 01:55:54.213]  to 1 p.m.
[01:55:54.213 --> 01:56:08.341]  on the 20th and bring a sign and come down there and let's show the Supreme Court that you want Richard Fein to be free and that we want to reveal what is going on with our justice system and reform it.
[01:56:08.341 --> 01:56:13.264]  And the rally at the Los Angeles Superior Court will be in full view
[01:56:13.912 --> 01:56:24.562]  Of Judge David Yaffe, the judge that jailed Mr. Fine, and all the others, as they come to work that morning, they'll have to pass through all the people there for the rally.
[01:56:24.562 --> 01:56:33.671]  And let's show support from the citizens that we want our justice system back, and we want clean and honest government, and we want fairness in the court.
[01:56:34.608 --> 01:56:40.092]  Well, this is so fundamental, I don't even have words to properly describe how important this is.
[01:56:40.092 --> 01:56:49.900]  I've studied the founding of our nation, the 15 years of tumult that led up to 1775, 1776, and the media always says it was about taxation.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:53.122]  And the Stamp Act was part of it, the Tea Act, that was part of it.
[01:56:53.122 --> 01:56:56.525]  But the main reason, you read this in the Declaration of Independence, as Mr. Fine said,
[01:56:57.205 --> 01:57:03.535]  Was that they created these King's Courts outside of the courts that Englishmen in England had access to.
[01:57:03.535 --> 01:57:07.101]  Well, we no longer had access to it here in the colonies.
[01:57:08.348 --> 01:57:10.510]  And it was the same thing.
[01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:11.971]  Judges would take your property.
[01:57:11.971 --> 01:57:14.633]  They would take bribes.
[01:57:14.633 --> 01:57:18.296]  Anybody that stood up against them, they would order them arrested with no trial.
[01:57:18.296 --> 01:57:31.687]  They would transport them to other colonies or to England for kangaroo trials, special courts the king set up that Englishmen had fought in the Magna Carta and the Parliament Act.
[01:57:31.687 --> 01:57:33.549]  So it's the same thing repeating itself.
[01:57:33.969 --> 01:57:38.515]  This is what went on in Soviet Russia, and Communist China, and Fidel Castro's Cuba.
[01:57:38.515 --> 01:57:51.632]  We know tyranny, and this is just another serious red flag, the biggest I've seen, and it shows how evil our mainstream media is, pretty much blacking this out, and we're going to try to talk to Mr. Fine.
[01:57:52.513 --> 01:58:01.580]  Coming up for about 30 minutes in the last hour today, but Leslie Dutton's website is fulldisclosure.net.
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:15.030]  Thank you so much, and I want to thank one of our writers out in California, Cassandra Anderson, who first alerted us to this and wrote that article, 4infowars.com, that you helped put together, Leslie Dutton.
[01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:18.773]  But I salute you, spending your time and energy to defend justice.
[01:58:19.178 --> 01:58:20.698]  Well, let me ask a favor of you.
[01:58:20.698 --> 01:58:29.921]  When you talk with Mr. Fine, be sure and ask him what impact the judicial corruption has on the political process.
[01:58:29.921 --> 01:58:42.745]  Because if you think we'll have fair elections, and if you think that the judges can impact the way elections turn out, and whether or not we have a democratic process, he can tell you why we should be concerned.
[01:58:42.745 --> 01:58:43.245]  Absolutely!
[01:58:43.245 --> 01:58:45.706]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.302 --> 01:58:54.805]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:58:54.805 --> 01:58:56.066]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.066 --> 01:58:59.730]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:59.730 --> 01:59:02.232]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.232 --> 01:59:07.638]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.098 --> 01:59:14.765]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.765 --> 01:59:20.732]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.732 --> 01:59:24.396]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:59:24.916 --> 01:59:29.198]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.198 --> 01:59:35.142]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.142 --> 01:59:38.703]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.703 --> 01:59:40.664]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.664 --> 01:59:41.805]  It's here.

[02:00:05.652 --> 02:00:06.952]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.952 --> 02:00:08.734]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.734 --> 02:00:10.495]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.495 --> 02:00:12.076]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.076 --> 02:00:13.637]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.637 --> 02:00:17.820]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:21.883]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.524 --> 02:00:27.475]  Yeah.
[02:00:33.928 --> 02:00:36.929]  Well, for the next hour, Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:00:36.929 --> 02:00:42.331]  We're going to intersperse the interview on the economy with your calls, reports from the Tea Parties.
[02:00:42.331 --> 02:00:48.053]  Democratic operatives have been caught all over the nation with swastika signs saying they were with the Tea Parties.
[02:00:48.053 --> 02:00:51.474]  They were caught organizing it two weeks ago by us and others.
[02:00:51.474 --> 02:00:56.315]  AP broke it nationally in mainstream news on Monday.
[02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:57.836]  Just incredible dirty tricks.
[02:00:57.836 --> 02:01:01.317]  Simultaneously, Homeland Security is saying
[02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:05.572]  What we already knew internally they were training for.
[02:01:05.572 --> 02:01:10.436]  Homegrown solo terrorist, as bad as Al Qaeda FBI chief says.
[02:01:10.436 --> 02:01:15.640]  So, focusing this apparatus in on the people of this nation.
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:19.103]  We're going to be covering that coming up.
[02:01:19.103 --> 02:01:22.145]  Again, Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:01:22.145 --> 02:01:23.886]  The toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:23.886 --> 02:01:24.467]  Also want to comment,
[02:01:28.889 --> 02:01:37.052]  On the viral video experiment that we posted yesterday, iPad tortured to death in mass social experiment.
[02:01:37.052 --> 02:01:41.494]  If you go watch the video at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, it'll make sense.
[02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:43.214]  And my predictions came true.
[02:01:43.214 --> 02:01:47.836]  I'm here on YouTube hitting refresh, reading the comments.
[02:01:49.332 --> 02:01:53.974]  And it says things like, honestly don't care if America tortures a few terrorists.
[02:01:53.974 --> 02:02:00.117]  It may not be fair, but it's not fair when they hijack planes and use suicide bombs either.
[02:02:00.117 --> 02:02:06.360]  And there's people saying, because I show an iPad being torn into pieces by us.
[02:02:07.794 --> 02:02:16.421]  And I don't say why I'm doing it, and at the end I say, I did this because it's going to upset you because you love things, some people, more than humans.
[02:02:16.421 --> 02:02:23.227]  And you're not going to be upset about the kids being tortured, and people being tortured, and people being shot that we show clips of on this video.
[02:02:23.227 --> 02:02:27.311]  You're going to be upset about the iPod, or iPad.
[02:02:27.311 --> 02:02:30.133]  And about a third of the people are so are.
[02:02:30.133 --> 02:02:31.935]  And I notice those that are mad about us
[02:02:33.325 --> 02:02:38.387]  ...destroying the iPad, because we didn't really torture it, it's not alive, I didn't feel it.
[02:02:38.387 --> 02:02:42.669]  They generally also comment, good, let's kill all the Arabs.
[02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:50.112]  What you don't know is, Hitler and others always pick an unpopular minority to test their systems out on, and it's designed for you.
[02:02:50.112 --> 02:02:56.135]  What we just covered with the case of judges putting people in jail that exposed them for taking payoffs.
[02:02:57.315 --> 02:03:00.538]  I mean, this is getting crazier and crazier, but it's important.
[02:03:00.538 --> 02:03:02.559]  This is on the front page of YouTube.
[02:03:02.559 --> 02:03:04.581]  I want to send it to the number one video.
[02:03:04.581 --> 02:03:15.950]  So go to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, get the video we have posted there, and send it to your entire email list, because this is really waking a lot of people up, and I'll explain why later.
[02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:17.191]  But I want to go ahead and go to Bob Chapman.
[02:03:17.191 --> 02:03:19.572]  Bob, when we come back, this is a short segment, as you know.
[02:03:20.942 --> 02:03:25.623]  I want to get into, like, where'd my CNN go?
[02:03:25.623 --> 02:03:26.424]  Here it is.
[02:03:26.424 --> 02:03:27.824]  CNN.
[02:03:27.824 --> 02:03:33.686]  SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, charges Goldman Sachs with fraud.
[02:03:33.686 --> 02:03:34.966]  Here's USA Today, U.S.
[02:03:34.966 --> 02:03:37.867]  accuses Goldman Sachs of fraud.
[02:03:37.867 --> 02:03:38.887]  MSNBC, U.S.
[02:03:38.887 --> 02:03:41.048]  charges Goldman Sachs with civil fraud.
[02:03:41.048 --> 02:03:43.669]  It should be criminal fraud.
[02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:47.570]  And, of course, Bob's been saying this for, I don't know how long we've been interviewing Bob.
[02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:50.311]  It's got to be 10 years or 12 years or something now.
[02:03:51.191 --> 02:04:03.343]  And we had the McClatchy News reporter on who broke this three months ago, Greg Gordon, who got through lawsuits, these internal documents that are now causing all of this to unfold.
[02:04:03.343 --> 02:04:08.628]  So we're going to come back to Bob Chapman, have him comment on the dollar going down, gold skyrocketing.
[02:04:09.629 --> 02:04:15.791]  Uh, right now, uh, where he sees the economy, uh, going and what this means, uh, with Goldman Sachs.
[02:04:15.791 --> 02:04:26.294]  As we know, the SEC is famously corrupt, and much of the government's run by Goldman Sachs alumni, and this revolving door show how could this now be happening.
[02:04:26.294 --> 02:04:29.215]  This is what should happen, but not just civil, criminal.
[02:04:29.995 --> 02:04:32.296]  And this opens Goldman Sachs up to even more lawsuits.
[02:04:32.296 --> 02:04:35.137]  A flotilla have been launched in the last year and a half.
[02:04:35.137 --> 02:04:36.238]  But this needs to be criminal.
[02:04:36.238 --> 02:04:39.199]  But this does begin to open the door towards criminal.
[02:04:39.199 --> 02:04:41.560]  And justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.861]  I'm just amazed this is even happening.
[02:04:43.861 --> 02:04:47.962]  But maybe they're using the investigation as a way to sweep up all the evidence and then cover it up.
[02:04:47.962 --> 02:04:49.523]  That's one of their favorite tricks.
[02:04:49.523 --> 02:04:52.124]  I don't know Bob's opinion on this, but I know I'm going to respect it.
[02:04:52.124 --> 02:04:53.224]  I respect his opinion.
[02:04:53.224 --> 02:04:55.125]  We'll get his take on it on the other side.
[02:04:55.125 --> 02:04:58.907]  I'm Alex Jones with PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[02:04:58.907 --> 02:04:59.347]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:04.401]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.401 --> 02:05:09.702]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.702 --> 02:05:11.763]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.763 --> 02:05:16.765]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.765 --> 02:05:17.945]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.945 --> 02:05:19.065]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.065 --> 02:05:20.946]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:22.026]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.026 --> 02:05:24.227]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.227 --> 02:05:25.567]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.567 --> 02:05:27.088]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.088 --> 02:05:28.108]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:05:28.308 --> 02:05:29.629]  And you can't feed yourself.
[02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:32.370]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.370 --> 02:05:35.951]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.951 --> 02:05:39.753]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.753 --> 02:05:40.994]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.994 --> 02:05:41.894]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.894 --> 02:05:42.995]  How much do you want?
[02:05:42.995 --> 02:05:43.935]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.935 --> 02:05:45.035]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.035 --> 02:05:48.077]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:48.077 --> 02:05:50.258]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:06:00.662]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.662 --> 02:06:01.822]  What's your home worth?
[02:06:01.822 --> 02:06:03.943]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:06:03.943 --> 02:06:06.984]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:06:06.984 --> 02:06:14.707]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[02:06:14.707 --> 02:06:18.108]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[02:07:00.126 --> 02:07:02.528]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:07:02.528 --> 02:07:04.830]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:08.032]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:07:08.032 --> 02:07:13.156]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:07:13.156 --> 02:07:17.680]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:20.122]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:07:20.122 --> 02:07:22.564]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:07:22.564 --> 02:07:25.406]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:07:25.806 --> 02:07:33.754]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:07:33.754 --> 02:07:39.120]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.462]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:07:41.462 --> 02:07:45.406]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:07:45.686 --> 02:07:46.747]  And I got news for you.
[02:07:46.747 --> 02:07:48.067]  You're everyone else.
[02:07:48.067 --> 02:07:49.568]  Invisible Empire.

[02:08:02.715 --> 02:08:09.338]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.338 --> 02:08:12.320]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.185 --> 02:08:22.068]  We are back live and now eight minutes into this third hour.
[02:08:22.068 --> 02:08:25.170]  Bob Chapman joins us once a week on Fridays.
[02:08:25.170 --> 02:08:26.571]  He's not going to be here the next two weeks though.
[02:08:26.571 --> 02:08:28.692]  He's taking a vacation.
[02:08:28.692 --> 02:08:30.813]  Certainly long overdue.
[02:08:30.813 --> 02:08:32.674]  I can't remember a time that Bob took off.
[02:08:32.674 --> 02:08:34.696]  Some weeks we don't have him on on Fridays because I take off.
[02:08:35.516 --> 02:08:45.342]  The International Forecaster worked in military intelligence, then was one of the biggest private silver and gold brokers in the world, had the most popular newsletter until he retired.
[02:08:45.342 --> 02:08:49.565]  Then he came back in the last decade and has the internationalforecaster.com.
[02:08:49.565 --> 02:08:54.287]  And he's always targeted the SEC as a particularly criminal group of regulators.
[02:08:54.287 --> 02:09:02.693]  He's always targeted the brokerage and investment banks as Goldman Sachs, as being the tip-top of the pyramid of corruption.
[02:09:02.693 --> 02:09:03.153]  You look at
[02:09:05.049 --> 02:09:14.777]  You look at Chile, you look at New Zealand, you look at Greece, you look at Germany, you look at England, you look at... Almost every country I look at, it's Goldman Sachs runs the Treasury.
[02:09:14.777 --> 02:09:16.518]  Goldman Sachs is the President.
[02:09:16.518 --> 02:09:18.680]  Or the Prime Minister, former Goldman Sachs.
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:22.203]  You've got the New York Fed, former Goldman Sachs.
[02:09:22.203 --> 02:09:24.224]  Now the Treasury Secretary, former Goldman Sachs.
[02:09:24.224 --> 02:09:26.626]  The last Treasury Secretary, former Goldman Sachs.
[02:09:26.626 --> 02:09:28.408]  SEC, full of Goldman Sachs.
[02:09:28.408 --> 02:09:29.769]  Five times the money.
[02:09:29.769 --> 02:09:31.410]  In fact, the biggest contributor to Obama.
[02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:32.371]  We're good to go.
[02:10:00.814 --> 02:10:01.074]  We're
[02:10:18.212 --> 02:10:18.973]  I think?
[02:10:38.090 --> 02:10:38.691]  Yes, we are.
[02:10:55.131 --> 02:10:58.312]  The other issue here is, I want Bob to really walk through all the facets, Bob.
[02:10:58.312 --> 02:11:01.653]  I'm going to try to shut up and let you roll with this for the rest of this segment.
[02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:06.274]  We're going to get into some other issues, but why is the SEC doing this?
[02:11:06.274 --> 02:11:18.437]  I mean, is this to sweep up, that's what my instincts tell me, because they've never done anything good, to sweep up all the evidence and investigation and then whitewash it before state grand juries indict, which we know there's movements towards.
[02:11:20.165 --> 02:11:43.244]  When you write about the states, the AG in Connecticut moved on them in a similar manner, a civil manner, and I wrote about that, I guess it was three weeks ago, and I said to the subscribers, especially you who live in Connecticut, go to the AG and ask them why he hasn't filed criminal charges.
[02:11:44.338 --> 02:11:50.740]  And then I saw a little bit later that the AG wants to run for the governor or something like that.
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:58.923]  So, you know, he wants to do something, but he doesn't want to get too much in the line of fire, so to speak.
[02:11:58.923 --> 02:12:04.165]  I've been going after the SEC for years.
[02:12:04.165 --> 02:12:11.087]  I started back in the early 80s, telling them of different scams that were going down.
[02:12:12.617 --> 02:12:15.058]  Eventually, they went after one of them.
[02:12:15.058 --> 02:12:16.379]  That was ten years later.
[02:12:16.379 --> 02:12:25.063]  And remember, for ten years, that other fellow, I forget his name, gave them complete dossiers on the Madoff scam, and they did nothing.
[02:12:25.063 --> 02:12:26.083]  That's right.
[02:12:26.083 --> 02:12:33.806]  And the reason they don't is the people in the SEC, first of all, answer to the government.
[02:12:33.806 --> 02:12:39.689]  And the government is controlled from behind the scenes by the large brokerage firms, in particular.
[02:12:40.789 --> 02:12:45.870]  And these people who work for the SEC, they work there five or seven, eight years.
[02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:48.931]  There's some exceptions, but not many.
[02:12:48.931 --> 02:12:56.512]  And then they'll contact the people who they've been overseeing from the agency.
[02:12:56.512 --> 02:13:00.533]  And they'll say, gee, I think I'd like to go to work for you.
[02:13:00.533 --> 02:13:05.914]  And of course, they've done nothing detrimental to these firms.
[02:13:05.914 --> 02:13:07.274]  And the firms say, well, sure.
[02:13:08.411 --> 02:13:17.838]  And the man's probably making $70,000 a year with the SEC, and he starts making $700,000 a year.
[02:13:17.838 --> 02:13:31.088]  And so this is sort of a conveyor belt from the SEC to the large firms, and that's a payoff to the SEC employees
[02:13:32.006 --> 02:13:34.828]  For looking the other way.
[02:13:34.828 --> 02:13:44.855]  And you just cited the gentleman who has since wrote a book about how he went after the SEC for 10 years and they wouldn't listen to him.
[02:13:44.855 --> 02:13:49.018]  Well, the reason why is this man was connected.
[02:13:49.901 --> 02:13:54.982]  And they may have well known that it was a CIA Mossad operation.
[02:13:54.982 --> 02:13:56.403]  I'm sure they did.
[02:13:56.403 --> 02:14:03.605]  And if you notice with that affair of Madoff, the trial was closed.
[02:14:03.605 --> 02:14:10.507]  And the only people there were the clerks of the court and the attorneys and the judge.
[02:14:11.745 --> 02:14:16.747]  Uh, and no evidence ever came out, because there were hundreds of people involved in that bank.
[02:14:16.747 --> 02:14:25.050]  And so- Yeah, they're claiming this guy stole from $60 to $110 billion all by himself, and no one else knew.
[02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:29.432]  Well, it's just like, uh, the lone killer theory, you know?
[02:14:29.432 --> 02:14:39.976]  And, uh, but, the SEC, uh, it operates at the behest of the government, and with the large firms,
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:41.841]  And that's why they don't get touched.
[02:14:41.841 --> 02:14:48.684]  And even if they do, even if the evidence is so blatant, they give them a fine.
[02:14:48.684 --> 02:14:51.165]  And the shareholders pay the fine, not them.
[02:14:51.165 --> 02:14:55.187]  And they go back doing the same thing the next day.
[02:14:55.187 --> 02:14:59.049]  They neither admit nor deny is the term.
[02:14:59.049 --> 02:15:01.770]  And I know I spent 28 years in the brokerage business.
[02:15:01.770 --> 02:15:03.571]  I own my own firm.
[02:15:03.571 --> 02:15:09.334]  And so what's happening here is the evidence is all there, as you pointed out,
[02:15:10.578 --> 02:15:22.080]  Through the Freedom of Information Act, McClatchy, the reporter, we have been writing about this, we'll call it an episode, for three years.
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:33.883]  And we didn't get very far, but evidently the attorneys for others who had bought this toxic waste that they were selling, they're going after them.
[02:15:33.883 --> 02:15:39.084]  And so the SEC was forced to act, and this is very important,
[02:15:39.699 --> 02:15:43.321]  They only act when they have to.
[02:15:43.321 --> 02:15:59.668]  So the overwhelming evidence is, let's see, as you said, Alex, if we can do as much whitewashing as we can, and we'll fine them probably maybe a billion dollars or something, and they'll go right on doing what they did before.
[02:15:59.668 --> 02:16:06.030]  Now, there's something going on here to the rest of Wall Street that's really disturbing.
[02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:07.431]  Because they're not all crooks.
[02:16:08.522 --> 02:16:15.948]  The people of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are crooks.
[02:16:15.948 --> 02:16:17.589]  Not all of them, but most of them.
[02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:19.810]  At the upper end.
[02:16:19.810 --> 02:16:34.381]  And I think the other people who are working on the street, as it's called, they're sick and tired of this relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Treasury Department and the government in general and the
[02:16:37.131 --> 02:16:41.472]  firm of JPMorgan Chase in their relationship with the Federal Reserve.
[02:16:41.472 --> 02:16:46.273]  And both Goldman and Morgan are owners of the Federal Reserve.
[02:16:46.273 --> 02:16:49.554]  Two of the largest owners along with Citigroup.
[02:16:49.554 --> 02:16:58.756]  And so what's going to happen here is they're going to try to smooth it over as much as possible because it's a bomb waiting to happen.
[02:16:58.756 --> 02:17:00.397]  Now, most people don't know it.
[02:17:00.397 --> 02:17:03.097]  I'm going to kind of go off to the side here.
[02:17:03.097 --> 02:17:05.138]  JPMorgan had
[02:17:06.630 --> 02:17:12.912]  A lot of records pulled by the FBI about a week ago.
[02:17:12.912 --> 02:17:15.313]  Most people don't know about it.
[02:17:15.313 --> 02:17:22.675]  One of my people in New York writes stuff and reports to me and he told me about it.
[02:17:22.675 --> 02:17:31.578]  He was the one, and incidentally I announced the Madoff paper two weeks before they came down on him.
[02:17:31.578 --> 02:17:36.319]  I knew about it and I knew it was going to happen through this source that I have.
[02:17:37.666 --> 02:17:43.211]  And this source told me about the FBI going in and taking these records.
[02:17:43.211 --> 02:17:50.877]  The records from Morgan, JPMorgan Chase, that they took were in regard to Enron.
[02:17:50.877 --> 02:18:03.507]  And what they and CIBC and Goldman and a number of other bankers had done was set up offshore accounts for Enron where they would show profits that didn't exist.
[02:18:03.507 --> 02:18:05.329]  And that's what kept the scam going.
[02:18:06.227 --> 02:18:08.792]  And so now they're investigating that.
[02:18:08.792 --> 02:18:11.698]  Now, I don't think it'll go much of any way.
[02:18:11.698 --> 02:18:14.243]  You'll see it in the papers and they'll find them.
[02:18:14.243 --> 02:18:15.306]  Nobody ever goes to jail.
[02:18:16.969 --> 02:18:18.910]  None of the Illuminati goes to jail.
[02:18:39.281 --> 02:18:44.683]  They're in trouble for telling people to buy these derivatives when they knew they were planning to tank them.
[02:18:44.683 --> 02:18:49.725]  So, you know, at least this will educate people further about the fact that this is criminal.
[02:18:49.725 --> 02:18:54.486]  But as you said, they're civilly going after them, not criminally.
[02:18:54.486 --> 02:18:58.007]  Well, there's one more step in this.
[02:18:58.007 --> 02:19:08.791]  And it's a matter of public record that all of these bankers and brokerage houses all work very closely with the rating agencies.
[02:19:09.554 --> 02:19:15.079]  Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, but mostly S&P and Moody's.
[02:19:15.079 --> 02:19:36.337]  And they together, let's say Bank A and S&P, decided that this tranche of syndicated mortgages, bonds, known as collateralized debt obligations, was AAA.
[02:19:36.337 --> 02:19:36.517]  Now,
[02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:44.712]  It wasn't triple A, it was triple B. And then the insurance companies like AIG certified it, so another layer of fraud.
[02:19:44.712 --> 02:19:45.873]  Exactly.
[02:19:45.873 --> 02:19:49.734]  And then they dropped from a dollar down to five cents.
[02:19:49.734 --> 02:19:50.755]  All right, stay there Bob.
[02:19:50.755 --> 02:19:55.277]  Let's come back, finish up any comments on this thing and into other very important news.
[02:19:55.277 --> 02:19:56.537]  Get your take on that.
[02:19:56.537 --> 02:19:59.318]  And then the Lister's phone calls out there.
[02:19:59.318 --> 02:19:59.919]  It's Friday.
[02:19:59.919 --> 02:20:00.339]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.959 --> 02:20:02.760]  Great news for pure water lovers!

[02:21:03.506 --> 02:21:05.707]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.707 --> 02:21:09.029]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.029 --> 02:21:14.133]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.133 --> 02:21:18.316]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:20.978]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.978 --> 02:21:23.521]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.521 --> 02:21:26.784]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.784 --> 02:21:34.391]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.711 --> 02:21:40.112]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.112 --> 02:21:42.953]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.953 --> 02:21:46.654]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.654 --> 02:21:47.734]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.734 --> 02:21:49.055]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:49.055 --> 02:21:50.555]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:00.453 --> 02:22:07.137]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.137 --> 02:22:15.241]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.241 --> 02:22:23.405]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.405 --> 02:22:28.168]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.488 --> 02:22:33.733]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.733 --> 02:22:38.078]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.078 --> 02:22:39.159]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:22:59.935 --> 02:23:05.757]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[02:23:05.757 --> 02:23:10.978]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:23:10.978 --> 02:23:13.839]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[02:23:13.839 --> 02:23:19.601]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[02:23:19.821 --> 02:23:28.969]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.

[02:24:10.555 --> 02:24:16.658]  Bob, getting into the Tea Parties nationwide, you've got the Republicans taking them over, part of the establishment.
[02:24:16.658 --> 02:24:27.725]  You've got Ron Paul supporters that founded the Tea Parties three years ago being beat up at Republican events in Phoenix, thrown out, they even ask questions, the police help the Tea Partiers beat them up.
[02:24:27.725 --> 02:24:31.368]  We've got the Democrats, finally in the Associated Press and major news,
[02:24:32.368 --> 02:24:36.711]  Showing up with Nazi signs, posing as Tea Partiers.
[02:24:36.711 --> 02:24:38.372]  They're attacking that angle.
[02:24:38.372 --> 02:24:45.496]  The media has advertised the only way to protest this takeover is the Tea Parties, and then they destroy that system.
[02:24:45.496 --> 02:24:51.939]  And now, on the heels of that, homegrown solo terrorists are as bad as Al-Qaeda, FBI chief warns.
[02:24:51.939 --> 02:25:01.125]  Al-Qaeda still aims to strike inside the United States, but homegrown or unaffiliated extremists now pose an equally serious threat, FBI Chief Robert Mueller warned.
[02:25:01.485 --> 02:25:01.685]  Yes.
[02:25:31.825 --> 02:25:38.852]  Anybody who doesn't like big government's a terrorist, and I believe they're going to stage terror attacks sooner rather than later to blame it on us and really have the big crackdown.
[02:25:38.852 --> 02:25:41.094]  What does Bob Chapman say?
[02:25:41.094 --> 02:25:42.715]  Four-pronged attack.
[02:25:42.715 --> 02:25:45.217]  Number one, to take over the Tea Party.
[02:25:45.217 --> 02:25:53.004]  Number two, to vilify them as the kind of things that are un-American.
[02:25:53.004 --> 02:25:57.689]  Number three, the police verifying that there are
[02:25:58.326 --> 02:25:58.767]  Not just
[02:26:18.383 --> 02:26:21.324]  Uh, to function and let the people know the truth.
[02:26:21.324 --> 02:26:24.045]  Well, the last one they've been very unsuccessful at.
[02:26:24.045 --> 02:26:27.047]  In fact, we're reaching more and more people every day.
[02:26:27.047 --> 02:26:29.347]  But that's the four-pronged attack.
[02:26:29.347 --> 02:26:39.011]  Now, you know, I was with Ronald Reagan on his Speaker's Bureau in Los Angeles in the mid-60s when Ronny first ran for governor.
[02:26:39.011 --> 02:26:40.532]  And I traveled a lot with him.
[02:26:41.454 --> 02:27:05.391]  And the minute, in one of my speeches, Lynn Nossing, who represented the Rockefeller interest from the East Coast, who was running the program for Reagan for Governor, the minute he found out I was very conservative, you know, he had me thrown out.
[02:27:05.391 --> 02:27:10.315]  And it's this sort of thing, the infiltration
[02:27:11.361 --> 02:27:22.268]  And it's like that, and we're seeing it now with the Republican hierarchy moving in on the Tea Party people.
[02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:30.472]  And they're probably going to neutralize it from what you've just said and the events that are going on.
[02:27:30.472 --> 02:27:44.396]  And of course, you've got the crazies from the Democratic-Liberal side who are running around as imposters saying that they're Tea Party people and being dressed up as radicals such as Nazis.
[02:27:44.396 --> 02:27:50.818]  And so they get this thing fully underway and we're going to see lots of it through the summer.
[02:27:51.759 --> 02:28:03.676]  And they're doing everything they can to try to keep these representatives and senators in the Senate and in Congress in order
[02:28:04.645 --> 02:28:10.867]  To continue to do the work of the people from behind the scenes, the Illuminists, because they got them all paid off.
[02:28:10.867 --> 02:28:11.308]  Exactly.
[02:28:11.308 --> 02:28:12.368]  Let me throw this in.
[02:28:12.368 --> 02:28:13.488]  Let me throw this in.
[02:28:13.488 --> 02:28:18.550]  You got Rand Paul and all the major polls at least 10 points ahead of the Democrat and Republican challenger.
[02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:26.894]  So the Republican Party's coming in and they're running somebody against him who is the head of elections, the Secretary of State.
[02:28:27.914 --> 02:28:30.938]  That's completely illegal and Ron Paul's been on the show and agrees.
[02:28:30.938 --> 02:28:32.540]  I mean, it's just it's never before been done.
[02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:35.744]  I was reading in Texas Statehouse elections.
[02:28:35.744 --> 02:28:45.475]  There's all these real Tea Party people who are beating old-line Republicans And so now the Republicans are coming in going after real Tea Party people.
[02:28:45.475 --> 02:28:47.758]  So everywhere they're trying to target
[02:28:48.058 --> 02:28:51.119]  Well, you gotta find that because they don't know what we know and they're not listening to us.
[02:28:51.119 --> 02:28:54.801]  They think in terms of political agenda and it really doesn't work that way and that's why so many
[02:29:16.283 --> 02:29:24.160]  People on radio and television, and especially newsletter writers, they can never get to the bottom of what's going on because they just don't understand.
[02:29:25.198 --> 02:29:26.298]  Look in California.
[02:29:26.298 --> 02:29:31.139]  I was on a Modesto the other day on a program that I do a couple of times a month.
[02:29:31.139 --> 02:29:31.899]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:29:31.899 --> 02:29:34.720]  Let's talk about that with Bob and go to your phone calls.
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:36.880]  And then I'm going to get into lawyers.
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:40.441]  Laptops took thousands of images of children in bed at home.
[02:29:40.441 --> 02:29:43.082]  It was part of the entertainment at the public school.
[02:29:43.082 --> 02:29:44.422]  This is going on nationwide.
[02:29:44.422 --> 02:29:47.883]  You better cover those cameras up on your laptops and iPads and iPhones.
[02:29:47.883 --> 02:29:48.763]  You are being watched.
[02:29:48.763 --> 02:29:51.523]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.523 --> 02:29:52.924]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.924 --> 02:29:54.444]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.467 --> 02:30:00.890]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.890 --> 02:30:02.211]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.211 --> 02:30:07.794]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:30:07.794 --> 02:30:12.817]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:30:12.817 --> 02:30:17.840]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:23.603]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:30:23.603 --> 02:30:25.904]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:30:25.904 --> 02:30:30.706]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:30:30.706 --> 02:30:31.827]  And here's the best part.
[02:30:31.827 --> 02:30:34.908]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:30:34.908 --> 02:30:38.190]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[02:31:08.712 --> 02:31:14.054]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[02:33:08.027 --> 02:33:08.348]  Central.
[02:33:08.348 --> 02:33:09.532]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:33:09.532 --> 02:33:10.235]  Eastern.
[02:33:10.235 --> 02:33:11.319]  We are here live.
[02:33:11.319 --> 02:33:12.102]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.134 --> 02:33:20.299]  We're getting great reviews for Invisible Empire, New World Defined, our new film, 18 months in the making.
[02:33:20.299 --> 02:33:36.173]  You can order the super high quality DVD, been shipping out for the last three days, at Infowars.com, two plus hour film, who the globalists are, their crimes, how they operate, how to stop them, a bunch of expanded extras, and it'll start shipping out
[02:33:37.316 --> 02:33:44.660]  Next Monday, it premieres on PrisonPlanet.tv on Wednesday, the 21st day of April, 2010.
[02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:47.542]  Police State 4, the rise of FEMA.
[02:33:47.542 --> 02:33:52.085]  Tyranny is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:33:52.085 --> 02:33:57.988]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth, and it's only getting worse.
[02:33:57.988 --> 02:34:01.290]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:09.756]  Veteran documentary filmmaker Alex Jones, that's me, conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:34:09.756 --> 02:34:14.219]  The military industrial complex is transforming our once free nation to a giant prison camp.
[02:34:14.219 --> 02:34:20.303]  A casual society control grid constructed in the name of fighting terrorism was actually built to enslave the American people.
[02:34:20.303 --> 02:34:27.488]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner is only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:34:28.248 --> 02:34:33.397]  This film exposes how the Continue Government Program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:34:33.397 --> 02:34:38.385]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, FEMA camps, and a shredded Constitution.
[02:34:39.690 --> 02:34:47.796]  Witness police and military savagely attacking innocent civilians as our own government unleashes false flag operations to justify its oppression.
[02:34:47.796 --> 02:34:54.601]  Then watch Alex Jones and others as we take on corrupt mercenary police and expose mainstream media brainwashing.
[02:34:54.601 --> 02:34:55.963]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:34:55.963 --> 02:34:56.383]  It's here.
[02:34:56.383 --> 02:35:01.187]  We've got a new sneak peek up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:01.187 --> 02:35:02.307]  You can order the DVD now.
[02:35:02.307 --> 02:35:03.809]  It's basically not even pre-ordering.
[02:35:03.809 --> 02:35:06.431]  Start shipping out on Monday and Tuesday.
[02:35:07.071 --> 02:35:23.406]  A lot of you'll be getting it on or before or right after the release date at PrisonPlanet.tv where you can download both these films or stream these films in high quality, burn them to regular CDs in DivX and other formats that play on most DVD players as an activist tool to get these out to everyone.
[02:35:23.406 --> 02:35:24.948]  I'm asking you to take action.
[02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:31.494]  Look, when we get up here and we say we've had a massive effect because of you being activist, the proof is in the pudding.
[02:35:31.494 --> 02:35:32.615]  There's a huge awakening.
[02:35:33.809 --> 02:35:35.790]  World government is now admitted.
[02:35:35.790 --> 02:35:39.172]  The people are starting to wake up every day.
[02:35:39.172 --> 02:35:47.798]  I can Google my name and see mainstream news articles and George Soros publications and the government lying about me, demonizing me, saying I'm dangerous.
[02:35:47.798 --> 02:35:51.460]  They're not doing that because we're weak.
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:56.043]  They're doing it because we're strong, we have the truth, we know their game plan, and they're scared.
[02:35:56.043 --> 02:35:56.243]  Listen.
[02:35:57.352 --> 02:36:11.769]  Gandhi said, before they brought the British down peacefully, back in the 1930s, they brought them down in the 50s, that first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:36:11.769 --> 02:36:16.694]  And I have been ignored, then I've been laughed at, now we're being attacked.
[02:36:17.592 --> 02:36:18.393]  What does that mean?
[02:36:18.393 --> 02:36:28.921]  I mean, Bob Chapman, when I get up here and say films are the equivalent of common sense, you know, in 1774, 1775, this is how people get their news and information.
[02:36:28.921 --> 02:36:32.083]  And these films have been seen by hundreds of millions of people.
[02:36:32.083 --> 02:36:38.668]  It's having a massive effect to the point of the Republican leadership is taking on our political coloration to try to fool people.
[02:36:38.668 --> 02:36:41.891]  I mean, this is the greatest compliment we could get, Bob.
[02:36:41.891 --> 02:36:43.192]  Well, you're right about that.
[02:36:43.192 --> 02:36:44.573]  And they're terrified.
[02:36:45.330 --> 02:36:49.154]  And it goes all the way down into the party ranks of both parties.
[02:36:49.154 --> 02:36:51.596]  Because they know what you represent.
[02:36:51.596 --> 02:36:56.220]  You're a threat to the scam that they're running, whatever that scam is.
[02:36:56.220 --> 02:36:59.503]  And all of these people have a scam, believe me.
[02:36:59.503 --> 02:37:07.190]  All the way from Wall Street down to the appointees and the bureaucrats and administrations.
[02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:09.853]  But, you know, the
[02:37:10.778 --> 02:37:15.900]  The power of what you've been putting out is immeasurable.
[02:37:15.900 --> 02:37:17.220]  Totally immeasurable.
[02:37:17.220 --> 02:37:33.826]  I get letters from all over the world via email, of course, and they all talk about you saying, well, I see what he's doing, and I've heard you on there, and this is wonderful, and I want to be a subscriber, and I'll never miss a Friday, and that sort of thing.
[02:37:33.826 --> 02:37:39.228]  So we are penetrating, and the enemy is terrified, and they should be.
[02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:45.021]  And we're going to win, just like Gandhi said, through that process.
[02:37:45.021 --> 02:37:55.703]  Well, they've committed such outrageous crimes out in the open, and we're just here saying, don't destroy our freedom, don't destroy our country, don't destroy our way of life, and calling us unpatriotic isn't going to work.
[02:37:55.703 --> 02:38:02.504]  The media is so discredited, I don't think they realize that when they attack us, that just makes more people come see what we have to say.
[02:38:02.504 --> 02:38:06.485]  It certainly does, believe me.
[02:38:06.485 --> 02:38:07.325]  It certainly does.
[02:38:08.203 --> 02:38:09.785]  Bob, I want to go to... Go ahead.
[02:38:09.785 --> 02:38:11.147]  No, no.
[02:38:11.147 --> 02:38:11.568]  That's okay.
[02:38:11.568 --> 02:38:12.689]  It's a preface.
[02:38:12.689 --> 02:38:15.714]  I want to go to calls, but first, this.
[02:38:15.714 --> 02:38:16.895]  Again, I want this to hit people.
[02:38:16.895 --> 02:38:21.642]  I want people to really sit back and let this soak in and meditate on it for a moment.
[02:38:21.642 --> 02:38:22.123]  Think about it.
[02:38:23.624 --> 02:38:35.207]  In California, in Michigan, in Tennessee, in Texas, in Florida, in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in New York, in New Jersey, in New Mexico, in Arizona, in Nevada.
[02:38:35.207 --> 02:38:36.888]  I mean, we can pull these articles up.
[02:38:36.888 --> 02:38:41.229]  We have where they put cameras in the showers.
[02:38:42.406 --> 02:38:59.365]  And then a visiting team in one case, about eight years ago in Tennessee, the girls basketball team was taking a shower after the game and saw the cameras, they ran out screaming, the parents got mad, and the school said, well our school knows this, we openly announced this year we watch the girls and the boys naked and we videotape them, because there could be crime in the showers.
[02:38:59.365 --> 02:39:00.346]  This isn't a nice school.
[02:39:01.227 --> 02:39:06.309]  And that was a psychological warfare test to just see if they can come out and say, we're watching you in the showers.
[02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:08.630]  And I've seen case after case of this.
[02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:14.652]  Cameras in the bathrooms, cameras in the stalls, cameras in the stalls at roadway stops, you know, everywhere.
[02:39:14.652 --> 02:39:17.953]  And then it comes out because the school announces it a month ago.
[02:39:17.953 --> 02:39:22.234]  Oh, we're watching the kids at home and we're watching their parents.
[02:39:22.234 --> 02:39:25.776]  And throw the photos up that have now been released by the court of kids
[02:39:26.836 --> 02:39:32.742]  Asleep in their beds and the school with the issued laptops and Google announced four years ago.
[02:39:32.742 --> 02:39:39.908]  They're watching people at home now I mean, it's so amazing and here's philly.com
[02:39:41.209 --> 02:39:41.489]  I don't know.
[02:40:02.383 --> 02:40:08.788]  A year and a half ago, Frontline showed teachers watching kids over the laptops.
[02:40:08.788 --> 02:40:13.811]  I want to play that video because, you know, the issue is the media is acting like this is an isolated case, Bob.
[02:40:13.811 --> 02:40:23.638]  This is not isolated, but the magnitude of how out of control government is that they come out and announce, we're watching you at home.
[02:40:23.638 --> 02:40:28.442]  I mean, this is more than Orwellian, Bob Chapman.
[02:40:28.442 --> 02:40:30.343]  It's strictly perversion.
[02:40:32.262 --> 02:40:34.063]  Of one form or another.
[02:40:34.063 --> 02:40:36.465]  That's really the basis to it.
[02:40:36.465 --> 02:40:39.867]  I mean, children don't do anything when they're sleeping.
[02:40:39.867 --> 02:40:45.431]  People don't fondle people in showers, in bathrooms, at schools.
[02:40:45.431 --> 02:40:46.772]  I mean, I never saw it.
[02:40:46.772 --> 02:40:48.573]  But that's not even the issue!
[02:40:48.573 --> 02:40:55.538]  You're guilty until proven innocent, and the school is perving, is openly watching people.
[02:40:55.538 --> 02:40:59.821]  I mean, the police can't put a camera in your house without a warrant, but the school just does it.
[02:40:59.821 --> 02:41:00.362]  It's illegal!
[02:41:01.874 --> 02:41:03.695]  That's right.
[02:41:03.695 --> 02:41:16.423]  But they're watching, not because they're concerned about anybody, they're watching to see what these people are like, and they're perverts!
[02:41:16.423 --> 02:41:28.330]  I'm going to play a video clip from a year and a half ago, long before this even broke, of another school district on Frontline with them playing this like it's no big deal.
[02:41:28.330 --> 02:41:30.672]  Let's go ahead and play that video clip now.
[02:41:32.188 --> 02:41:37.591]  So I click and there's an observe button and it brings up their screen.
[02:41:37.591 --> 02:41:43.934]  The school's assistant principal spends part of each day remotely monitoring what the kids are doing on their laptops.
[02:41:43.934 --> 02:41:45.475]  We have a photo booth.
[02:41:45.475 --> 02:41:47.896]  He can see them, but they can't see him.
[02:41:47.896 --> 02:41:52.278]  These kids are goofing off, taking pictures of themselves in class.
[02:41:52.278 --> 02:41:54.639]  So wait, do all the kids have the cameras on?
[02:41:54.639 --> 02:41:55.900]  Sixth and seventh grade have cameras.
[02:41:56.852 --> 02:42:00.854]  A lot of kids are just on it to check their hair, do their makeup.
[02:42:00.854 --> 02:42:02.074]  They just use it like it's a mirror.
[02:42:02.074 --> 02:42:08.376]  I always like to mess with them and take a picture.
[02:42:08.376 --> 02:42:10.697]  Nine times out of ten, they duck out of the way.
[02:42:10.697 --> 02:42:13.598]  And then they shut down and they get right back to work.
[02:42:13.598 --> 02:42:17.000]  So, I can see he's got a few things going on here.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.681]  He's got the photo booth program open.
[02:42:19.681 --> 02:42:22.302]  He's got his social studies project open.
[02:42:22.302 --> 02:42:23.222]  School email open.
[02:42:25.319 --> 02:42:31.407]  You know, I think the kids know what is expected of them, but they also want to do all their other things.
[02:42:31.407 --> 02:42:34.070]  That's what I see a lot of, is the multitasking.
[02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:36.193]  But I was doing my work, too.
[02:42:36.193 --> 02:42:41.419]  Most of the adults at the school actually seemed pretty sanguine about the kids being so easily distracted.
[02:42:41.419 --> 02:42:42.721]  You learn something new every day.
[02:42:45.385 --> 02:42:50.507]  Okay, so out in plain view, they train the children to be watched.
[02:42:50.507 --> 02:42:56.170]  Everything they do being photographed in the school, now it's outside of the school.
[02:42:56.170 --> 02:42:57.271]  These are laboratories.
[02:42:57.271 --> 02:42:59.072]  They thumb scan to get school lunches.
[02:42:59.072 --> 02:43:00.892]  They're biometrically controlled.
[02:43:00.892 --> 02:43:01.713]  They're frisked.
[02:43:01.713 --> 02:43:02.653]  They're searched.
[02:43:02.653 --> 02:43:04.834]  This is prison training.
[02:43:04.834 --> 02:43:08.936]  This is the destruction of our free republic, Bob.
[02:43:08.936 --> 02:43:09.617]  It certainly is.
[02:43:11.312 --> 02:43:22.020]  It's the practice of continually watching people, and people become hardened to it, and they expect it as normal.
[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:24.722]  And it's not normal.
[02:43:24.722 --> 02:43:35.729]  And so, in the social experiment, the government's been watching you at school, now they say we're watching you at home, the parents get upset, they haven't been conditioned enough to accept it, they file lawsuits.
[02:43:35.729 --> 02:43:37.671]  Again, it's all part of incrementalism, do you agree?
[02:43:38.701 --> 02:43:40.462]  Absolutely.
[02:43:40.462 --> 02:43:43.845]  Dialectic incrementalism.
[02:43:43.845 --> 02:43:45.806]  Let's take some calls.
[02:43:45.806 --> 02:43:47.568]  Let's talk to Brad in California.
[02:43:47.568 --> 02:43:50.330]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:43:50.330 --> 02:43:51.951]  Go ahead, Brad.
[02:43:51.951 --> 02:43:54.973]  Hey, thanks, Alex, and thanks, Bob.
[02:43:54.973 --> 02:44:00.257]  This kind of is a little off topic, but I'll try to tie it into economics a little bit.
[02:44:00.257 --> 02:44:02.799]  I want to talk about soft kills, eugenics, and
[02:44:03.897 --> 02:44:07.360]  Vegetarianism, veganism, and low-fat diets.
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:09.682]  You can see how they're promoting that.
[02:44:09.682 --> 02:44:13.706]  The environmentalists are promoting veganism, vegetarianism.
[02:44:13.706 --> 02:44:16.669]  They're trying to... Yeah, they admit they're going to put taxes on all meat.
[02:44:16.669 --> 02:44:18.530]  That's already started in Europe.
[02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:23.295]  And it's also shown that the brain doesn't develop as well without the fatty acids and things that are in meat.
[02:44:24.471 --> 02:44:29.858]  Absolutely, and people become sterilized by veganism and vegetarianism, definitely.
[02:44:29.858 --> 02:44:32.761]  And so they're trying to sterilize... Well, that's actually true.
[02:44:32.761 --> 02:44:43.475]  Women that are on vegan diets, most of them have trouble having children, and their doctor won't even tell them why they can't have children, because if you're not getting enough protein, the body shuts down and won't let you be reproductive.
[02:44:44.551 --> 02:44:46.292]  Absolutely, and it makes people more docile.
[02:44:46.292 --> 02:45:06.545]  If you look at ancient tribes, like Weston A. Price visited all these tribes throughout the world, people who tried to eat a traditional diet, high in fat, high in animal meats and blood and things like that, organs, they were strong, territorial, they held their ground, and people who ate more of a vegetarian style diet were docile, easily conquered.
[02:45:07.345 --> 02:45:10.747]  I just think it's amazing that some of the things that some of the listeners come up with and the intelligent
[02:45:26.509 --> 02:45:30.550]  Uh, coverage that they get out of it.
[02:45:30.550 --> 02:45:33.091]  I mean, I didn't know what this gentleman's talking about.
[02:45:33.091 --> 02:45:35.872]  You know, I had never read about it.
[02:45:35.872 --> 02:45:40.273]  And I thank you for calling in because I just learned something.
[02:45:40.273 --> 02:45:46.955]  And then the system infects the meat with poisons and antibiotics and garbage and then moves in to shut it down.
[02:45:46.955 --> 02:45:47.596]  It's incredible.
[02:45:47.596 --> 02:45:49.036]  Brad, I appreciate your call.
[02:45:49.036 --> 02:45:51.437]  Tracy in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[02:45:52.284 --> 02:45:53.766]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:45:53.766 --> 02:45:54.948]  Doing okay.
[02:45:54.948 --> 02:45:56.230]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:59.275]  Hey, I was at the tea party yesterday in Albuquerque.
[02:46:00.325 --> 02:46:02.566]  Yes, for those that don't know, let me pull the article out.
[02:46:02.566 --> 02:46:07.188]  Guys, let's put the swastika photos on screen from the newspaper there.
[02:46:07.188 --> 02:46:12.950]  Democratic operatives running around with signs that said, Nazi youth for lower taxes.
[02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:17.993]  And we know groups nationally, this is in the AP Monday, pushed to do this.
[02:46:17.993 --> 02:46:23.775]  And this is similar to what the Congressional Black Caucus got caught a month ago doing, lying about the N-word and being spit on.
[02:46:23.775 --> 02:46:25.576]  Go ahead, you were there, what did you see?
[02:46:26.963 --> 02:46:31.436]  Well, they must have been on the other side of the street or something.
[02:46:31.436 --> 02:46:33.121]  I didn't see anything like that.
[02:46:34.513 --> 02:46:37.716]  Everybody I saw had decent signs.
[02:46:37.716 --> 02:46:39.217]  Well, this was in Santa Fe.
[02:46:39.217 --> 02:46:39.738]  Where were you?
[02:46:39.738 --> 02:46:41.279]  Oh, I was in Albuquerque.
[02:46:41.279 --> 02:46:42.139]  Okay, different city.
[02:46:42.139 --> 02:46:43.060]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:45.962]  Well, there were thousands of people out there.
[02:46:45.962 --> 02:46:50.726]  I got there about 3.30 and it was from 4 until 7.
[02:46:50.726 --> 02:46:54.429]  I left about 6 and I almost couldn't get out.
[02:46:54.429 --> 02:46:56.791]  I mean, I never saw so many people in one place.
[02:46:57.555 --> 02:47:07.161]  I handed out about 120 of your tapes and some of them to people with large church groups that swore that they were going to play them for their churches.
[02:47:07.161 --> 02:47:11.443]  A couple of biker groups, one had 100 in it and another had 120.
[02:47:11.443 --> 02:47:18.327]  I gave them five of your DVDs and they guaranteed me his whole group is going to watch them.
[02:47:18.327 --> 02:47:22.610]  Some of the guys have been talking about getting them and making copies and passing them out too.
[02:47:24.111 --> 02:47:35.239]  Yeah, they're scared to death that the Patriots are going to take the Tea Parties back and use them as meeting groups to educate mainline Republicans.
[02:47:35.239 --> 02:47:41.985]  That's why all these Republican leaders have been demonizing us and others and saying they've got to keep us out of the Tea Parties.
[02:47:41.985 --> 02:47:44.327]  But wonderful, wonderful job that you did.
[02:47:45.883 --> 02:47:52.384]  I just saturated them with your tapes and let me ask you, can you make a copy out of one of your copies?
[02:47:52.384 --> 02:47:53.324]  Yes.
[02:47:53.324 --> 02:47:55.765]  Okay, well that's what I told them to do and they said they would.
[02:47:55.765 --> 02:47:57.025]  Of course!
[02:47:57.025 --> 02:48:08.567]  And they were tickled to death to get them, the ones that got them for me, there was only one lady that was a little smarter than everyone else and said she thought she had all the information she needed about what was going on.
[02:48:08.567 --> 02:48:12.688]  And I checked her sign, it was okay, she seemed okay, she was just a smarty and
[02:48:13.624 --> 02:48:14.345]  So I went on.
[02:48:14.345 --> 02:48:17.066]  Everybody else was shaking my hand, thanking me.
[02:48:17.066 --> 02:48:18.768]  They were appreciative of it.
[02:48:18.768 --> 02:48:21.850]  Did you tell them that this will give them the full picture?
[02:48:21.850 --> 02:48:22.690]  Yes, I did.
[02:48:22.690 --> 02:48:26.773]  I told them that you know why you're here.
[02:48:26.773 --> 02:48:32.657]  If you watch these DVDs, you will know exactly why you're here.
[02:48:32.657 --> 02:48:35.919]  It will give you all the missing pieces that you don't have.
[02:48:35.919 --> 02:48:37.300]  And I know you don't have them all.
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:38.661]  No one does.
[02:48:38.661 --> 02:48:42.443]  But these DVDs will get you started on the right track.
[02:48:42.443 --> 02:48:42.944]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:43.604 --> 02:48:45.005]  Make copies if you can.
[02:48:45.005 --> 02:48:46.226]  Pass them out.
[02:48:46.226 --> 02:48:47.847]  Let your friends see them.
[02:48:47.847 --> 02:48:48.788]  Ask your friends over.
[02:48:48.788 --> 02:48:52.611]  Well, Tracy, it's what you're saying right now is what scares the globalists to death.
[02:48:52.611 --> 02:48:54.232]  Because you go wake people up.
[02:48:54.232 --> 02:48:55.813]  They wake other people up.
[02:48:55.813 --> 02:48:58.154]  The truth's only got to be applied once.
[02:48:58.154 --> 02:49:00.476]  Lies have to be applied over and over again.
[02:49:00.476 --> 02:49:03.198]  And we're having a devastating effect on these people.
[02:49:03.198 --> 02:49:05.199]  Bob Chapman.
[02:49:05.199 --> 02:49:05.680]  I agree.
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:08.282]  And it's too bad that
[02:49:09.542 --> 02:49:11.704]  He wasn't in the right city, unfortunately.
[02:49:11.704 --> 02:49:16.209]  He would have saw the antics of the Democratic operatives.
[02:49:16.209 --> 02:49:22.496]  And, you know, that's really foolish, because when you do things like that, you always get discouraged.
[02:49:22.496 --> 02:49:23.637]  And, you know, not discouraged.
[02:49:23.637 --> 02:49:25.680]  You always get discovered.
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:28.383]  And, you know, to do that is just really dumb.
[02:49:30.439 --> 02:49:31.059]  Absolutely.
[02:49:31.059 --> 02:49:32.200]  Well, Tracy, great job.
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:33.381]  Anything else?
[02:49:33.381 --> 02:49:37.763]  Oh, well, yeah, I just wanted to say that, you know, I hope it works.
[02:49:37.763 --> 02:49:40.125]  I hope they do what they say they were going to.
[02:49:40.125 --> 02:49:49.550]  This one biker, he saw me with my bag on the ground, shifting through, you know, I had them all separated out in different baggies, and he said, hey, man,
[02:49:50.051 --> 02:50:00.853]  Get that up off the ground, set it on my saddle bag here on this big Harley and had me lean my cane up there and he said, you, whenever you're around here, you put that up here and work out of here.
[02:50:00.853 --> 02:50:03.554]  Don't you big bend over, stand up.
[02:50:03.554 --> 02:50:12.475]  So everybody was very nice, very appreciative of getting these DVDs and they were chomping at the bit to get home and see him.
[02:50:12.475 --> 02:50:13.655]  Awesome, Tracy.
[02:50:13.655 --> 02:50:15.096]  And again, I keep going back to this.
[02:50:15.096 --> 02:50:15.976]  We're not hyping this.
[02:50:15.976 --> 02:50:16.596]  It's the truth.
[02:50:17.924 --> 02:50:19.926]  We are hurting the New World Order.
[02:50:19.926 --> 02:50:21.447]  We have the truth.
[02:50:21.447 --> 02:50:28.553]  And as the founder of the Texas Rangers said, a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right who keeps on a coming.
[02:50:28.553 --> 02:50:31.515]  And we just gotta keep on a coming, don't we Bob?
[02:50:31.515 --> 02:50:33.036]  You better believe it.
[02:50:33.036 --> 02:50:41.943]  You have to have the perseverance to not let the SOBs get you down.
[02:50:41.943 --> 02:50:43.104]  That'd be a good bumper sticker.
[02:50:43.104 --> 02:50:45.126]  Don't let the SOBs get you down.
[02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:49.510]  In fact, that's what Hutton Gibson would always say to me.
[02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:50.411]  I need to call him up.
[02:50:50.411 --> 02:50:53.812]  Boy, he's got to be like 86, 87 now.
[02:50:53.812 --> 02:50:57.733]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more of your calls.
[02:50:57.733 --> 02:51:00.353]  Bob, Mark, Erwin, and others.
[02:51:00.353 --> 02:51:01.894]  Stay with us.

[02:51:50.467 --> 02:51:51.147]  Maxfit Gloves.
[02:51:51.147 --> 02:51:53.269]  Incredible grip in any conditions.
[02:52:01.084 --> 02:52:03.406]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.406 --> 02:52:05.788]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.788 --> 02:52:08.991]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.991 --> 02:52:14.095]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.095 --> 02:52:18.299]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.599 --> 02:52:21.063]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.063 --> 02:52:23.506]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.506 --> 02:52:26.751]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.751 --> 02:52:34.362]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.682 --> 02:52:40.086]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.086 --> 02:52:42.928]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.928 --> 02:52:46.611]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.611 --> 02:52:47.692]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.692 --> 02:52:49.033]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.033 --> 02:52:50.534]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:00.416 --> 02:53:07.701]  UtopiaSilver.com believes, as the Declaration of Independence states, that our rights come from God, not from government.
[02:53:07.701 --> 02:53:16.886]  The only lawful purpose of any government is to protect and secure the rights of the people, and no man or government has the authority to take what has been given to us by God.
[02:53:16.886 --> 02:53:20.108]  Among these rights are life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:53:20.328 --> 02:53:25.473]  And America's government has ceased to be the protector of liberty and of the people's God-given rights.
[02:53:25.473 --> 02:53:32.659]  But we, the people, can return America to greatness if we are willing to stand up and reassert our stolen rights.
[02:53:32.659 --> 02:53:36.643]  We ask that you join Utopia Silver in changing America's course in history.

[02:54:13.167 --> 02:54:15.270]  Final hour coming up.
[02:54:15.270 --> 02:54:23.582]  Your phone calls a guest joining us from prison if he's able to get through being held in violation of habeas corpus for exposing payoffs to judges.
[02:54:24.603 --> 02:54:27.705]  And this is even starting to get into the mainstream news.
[02:54:27.705 --> 02:54:40.513]  It dovetails, for those that can't believe this is going on, two judges plead guilty to sending kids to lockup, pair accused of taking 2.6 million in payoffs to put away innocent young offenders.
[02:54:40.513 --> 02:54:40.774]  You know,
[02:54:41.843 --> 02:54:42.883]  Well, you're right.
[02:54:42.883 --> 02:54:43.724]  You know, that situation in L.A.
[02:55:10.315 --> 02:55:19.939]  I lived there for 36 years, and a very good friend of mine was one of the top people in the district attorney's office.
[02:55:19.939 --> 02:55:33.343]  In fact, he was very good friends with Johnny Cochran, who is now deceased, who represented OJ Simpson in his trial, the murder trial.
[02:55:33.343 --> 02:55:37.505]  I knew that this was going on for years, and everybody would just turn their head.
[02:55:38.636 --> 02:55:55.926]  And one of the things that I found that really disturbed me were a lot of these judges, federal and superior court judges, people of stature, were alcoholics, drug addicts, and perverts.
[02:55:55.926 --> 02:55:59.308]  I was really shocked.
[02:55:59.308 --> 02:56:00.929]  And that enters into their
[02:56:01.952 --> 02:56:03.053]  Let's talk to Rob in Florida.
[02:56:03.053 --> 02:56:03.834]  You're on the air Rob.
[02:56:03.834 --> 02:56:04.475]  Go ahead.
[02:56:19.557 --> 02:56:24.099]  Giving a report a little bit on the Tea Party movement here yesterday in Collier County, Florida.
[02:56:24.099 --> 02:56:26.299]  We had a phenomenal turnout.
[02:56:26.299 --> 02:56:31.621]  I am a candidate for the Constitution Party running for Collier County Commissioner District 2.
[02:56:31.621 --> 02:56:34.122]  We have five different districts, so five different commissioners.
[02:56:34.982 --> 02:56:37.743]  And a phenomenal turnout yesterday.
[02:56:37.743 --> 02:56:50.646]  I was able to speak publicly to the crowd that was gathered, and I had one individual, a local businessman, who just entered the gubernatorial race for Florida only just a couple of days ago.
[02:56:50.646 --> 02:56:54.667]  I myself only joined the race for Collier County Commission a week and a half ago.
[02:56:54.667 --> 02:57:03.329]  And whether you win or lose, you win because you get the issues out there, just like Ron Paul did in loss, but now his message is a thousand times bigger.
[02:57:04.315 --> 02:57:05.517]  Exactly.
[02:57:05.517 --> 02:57:15.069]  And I was able to speak to the crowd that was gathered for about two to three minutes and I pointed out the fact that both Democrats and Republicans have been sold down the road and disenfranchised.
[02:57:15.069 --> 02:57:15.730]  Both are parties.
[02:57:16.300 --> 02:57:26.146]  By pointing out that Bush doubled the size of government in his term, and that Obama at least doubled the size of government in his first year of office.
[02:57:26.146 --> 02:57:37.073]  And I said it is time for people in the local government to go back to using the Constitution as our guiding principle on what legislation we enact and which we refuse.
[02:57:37.073 --> 02:57:44.337]  And when I spoke this, even though one of my opponents spoke, and the candidate for the gubernatorial race spoke,
[02:57:45.649 --> 02:57:47.594]  The crowd erupted in it.
[02:57:48.573 --> 02:57:55.235]  Incredible applause when I said that it is time for a new party that will actually represent the American people.
[02:57:55.235 --> 02:58:04.798]  Absolutely, and the Republicans are staking their fortune on the Tea Party taking it over and we're going to end up the same place we are now or worse once they get back in.
[02:58:04.798 --> 02:58:08.079]  We have to fundamentally discredit this entire criminal system.
[02:58:08.079 --> 02:58:09.680]  I appreciate your call, Rob.
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:10.780]  That's a great report.
[02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:14.261]  Let's throw that comment by the Texas Ranger back there up on screen.
[02:58:14.261 --> 02:58:17.102]  This makes me think of Ron Paul in his 30 plus years.
[02:58:17.682 --> 02:58:17.962]  Thank you.
[02:58:41.455 --> 02:58:47.176]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.176 --> 02:58:51.617]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.617 --> 02:58:54.618]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.618 --> 02:58:59.939]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.939 --> 02:59:01.999]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.999 --> 02:59:07.001]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.001 --> 02:59:08.181]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.181 --> 02:59:08.921]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.301 --> 02:59:11.183]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.183 --> 02:59:12.265]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.265 --> 02:59:14.467]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.467 --> 02:59:15.809]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.809 --> 02:59:17.331]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.331 --> 02:59:22.597]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.597 --> 02:59:25.721]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.181 --> 02:59:30.004]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.004 --> 02:59:31.224]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.224 --> 02:59:32.125]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.125 --> 02:59:33.226]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.226 --> 02:59:34.166]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.166 --> 02:59:35.267]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.267 --> 02:59:38.309]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:40.090]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.090 --> 02:59:40.991]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:54.088 --> 02:59:56.011]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.011 --> 02:59:59.277]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:10.734 --> 03:00:12.296]  We'll see if he can get through.
[03:00:12.296 --> 03:00:19.503]  Sheriff Baca for the last year has not allowed Richard Fine to do any interviews until Judicial Watch sued.
[03:00:19.503 --> 03:00:23.927]  And finally he's done a video interview, jailhouse interview.
[03:00:23.927 --> 03:00:30.033]  He's being held without habeas corpus for exposing judges taking money for rulings.
[03:00:30.033 --> 03:00:35.078]  I mean this is incredible and it dovetails again with two judges plead guilty and sending kids to lockup.
[03:00:36.215 --> 03:00:41.016]  The pair admit they took 2.6 million in payoff to put away innocent young offenders.
[03:00:41.016 --> 03:00:43.917]  They were paid off by the private prison facility.
[03:00:43.917 --> 03:00:48.499]  We'll see if he's able to get through on the line with us for a 15-20 minute interview.
[03:00:48.499 --> 03:00:53.040]  I've got a bunch of news that I haven't even gotten into yet.
[03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:56.701]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[03:00:56.701 --> 03:00:58.702]  Erwin in Canada, you're on the air.
[03:00:58.702 --> 03:00:59.342]  Thanks for holding.
[03:01:00.128 --> 03:01:00.869]  Yes.
[03:01:00.869 --> 03:01:02.330]  Congratulations, Alex.
[03:01:02.330 --> 03:01:07.255]  I'm listening as much as I can every day, and I see you're making progress.
[03:01:07.255 --> 03:01:08.797]  We're making progress together, sir.
[03:01:08.797 --> 03:01:09.337]  God bless you.
[03:01:09.337 --> 03:01:11.099]  What's on your mind?
[03:01:11.099 --> 03:01:18.206]  I have a suggestion, and I think this is absolutely most important, considering biblical principles.
[03:01:18.206 --> 03:01:21.970]  A good biblical principle for healing is forgiveness.
[03:01:23.331 --> 03:01:25.072]  And I want to tell you a little story.
[03:01:25.072 --> 03:01:25.992]  I come from Germany.
[03:01:25.992 --> 03:01:32.374]  I was 18 years old when they came to Canada, and I was told here I was a Nazi.
[03:01:32.374 --> 03:01:35.455]  I didn't even know what that really was.
[03:01:35.455 --> 03:01:40.036]  My parents were never involved in the National Socialistic Party with Hitler.
[03:01:40.036 --> 03:01:45.318]  They opposed Hitler to the point where they were afraid to be jailed.
[03:01:45.318 --> 03:01:50.039]  If we wouldn't have been nine children at home, my dad would have been jailed.
[03:01:50.808 --> 03:01:52.508]  So you can see where I come from.
[03:01:52.508 --> 03:01:53.369]  Well, let me say this.
[03:01:53.369 --> 03:01:54.569]  It's going to be the same thing.
[03:01:54.569 --> 03:02:04.111]  Americans now go to other countries and are hated because of the torture, even though as Americans we've been speaking out against it and fighting against it, we still get the blame for it.
[03:02:04.111 --> 03:02:06.991]  And America is now known as an engine of evil worldwide.
[03:02:06.991 --> 03:02:08.592]  More and more we are.
[03:02:08.592 --> 03:02:12.013]  And when we're brought to justice, we're all going to be blamed for it.
[03:02:12.013 --> 03:02:12.593]  Yes.
[03:02:12.593 --> 03:02:14.093]  And this is my suggestion.
[03:02:14.093 --> 03:02:15.713]  And I think it's most important.
[03:02:15.713 --> 03:02:17.954]  It is a biblical principle.
[03:02:17.954 --> 03:02:18.494]  And that is,
[03:02:19.167 --> 03:02:41.989]  You have the credibility to, on behalf of the American people, publicly, to apologize to the German people for having vilified and identified the German people with Hitler, even though Hitler, by hook and crook, was voted in to the Chancellery by only 32% of the public
[03:02:45.844 --> 03:02:46.744]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:02:46.744 --> 03:02:49.505]  I mean, I've exposed that and I've talked about that.
[03:02:49.505 --> 03:02:55.708]  I wasn't alive then, and so I don't think it would be proper for me to sit there and apologize.
[03:02:55.708 --> 03:02:57.909]  I think it's all part of information.
[03:02:57.909 --> 03:03:06.933]  I mean, I have apologized for the torture of children and for the fact that we're under mind control in this country and so many people support it.
[03:03:06.933 --> 03:03:11.715]  And I see them in the YouTube comments on our iPod video, people just praising the death of children.
[03:03:11.715 --> 03:03:12.876]  It's totally sick.
[03:03:14.058 --> 03:03:14.891]  But, um...
[03:03:16.556 --> 03:03:17.917]  Again, that's stereotypes.
[03:03:17.917 --> 03:03:22.099]  It's like, imagine how the Arabs feel, or people with brown skin from the Middle East.
[03:03:22.099 --> 03:03:25.520]  I mean, the Middle East, on average, is over 20% Christian.
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:29.662]  And, you know, Christians take Sikhs from India.
[03:03:29.662 --> 03:03:31.123]  They have nothing to do with Muslims.
[03:03:31.123 --> 03:03:32.724]  And I'm not bashing Muslims here either.
[03:03:32.724 --> 03:03:34.104]  They have nothing to do with Muslims.
[03:03:34.104 --> 03:03:45.230]  And last time I saw it was over 30-plus in the last six, seven years, eight years, since 9-11, that people walk into gas stations or liquor stores or hotels and shoot Sikhs.
[03:03:45.970 --> 03:03:52.494]  Because they're wearing turbans on their head, part of their religion to have long hair and not cut their hair.
[03:03:52.494 --> 03:04:00.160]  Do I apologize to the Sikhs for government propaganda that makes crazy people go shoot them?
[03:04:06.343 --> 03:04:12.688]  Really study geopolitical systems and cultural systems before they make judgments.
[03:04:12.688 --> 03:04:29.739]  I'm seeing the comments right now on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on this YouTube video, the psychological experiment I did yesterday, iPad torture to death and mass social experiment, and there they are under it, attacking me for destroying an iPad because they only care about things.
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:39.743]  And saying under it that, you know, it's wonderful to kill children, all the Muslims are going to grow up to be terrorists, so it's a good thing.
[03:04:39.743 --> 03:04:43.345]  Kids are, you know, shot up by the gunship.
[03:04:43.345 --> 03:04:45.025]  And it's just commenter after commenter.
[03:04:45.025 --> 03:04:46.066]  And these are real commenters.
[03:04:46.066 --> 03:04:49.487]  You can go to their own YouTube pages and see them.
[03:04:49.487 --> 03:04:51.928]  And these are the people that end up being our government leaders.
[03:04:51.928 --> 03:04:56.110]  They're the ones that end up holding the trudgeon that slams into our head.
[03:04:56.110 --> 03:04:58.290]  So, I don't know if I need to apologize.
[03:04:58.290 --> 03:04:59.531]  I've been doing the best job I can.
[03:04:59.991 --> 03:05:01.112]  I don't have the guilt for this.
[03:05:01.112 --> 03:05:02.373]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.373 --> 03:05:07.958]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:05:07.958 --> 03:05:12.982]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:05:12.982 --> 03:05:13.463]  It's true.
[03:05:13.463 --> 03:05:16.285]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[03:05:16.285 --> 03:05:18.027]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:05:18.547 --> 03:05:23.791]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:05:23.791 --> 03:05:26.092]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:05:26.092 --> 03:05:30.895]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:05:30.895 --> 03:05:32.016]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:32.016 --> 03:05:35.078]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:05:35.078 --> 03:05:38.701]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:05:38.701 --> 03:05:41.903]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:05:41.903 --> 03:05:44.124]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:05:44.124 --> 03:05:45.045]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:05:48.687 --> 03:05:52.909]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:05:52.909 --> 03:05:57.751]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:05:57.751 --> 03:06:00.132]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:02.588 --> 03:06:06.549]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:06.549 --> 03:06:15.411]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:06:15.411 --> 03:06:20.052]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:06:20.052 --> 03:06:30.874]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:06:31.494 --> 03:06:41.016]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:41.016 --> 03:06:46.438]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:06:46.438 --> 03:06:53.919]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:53.919 --> 03:06:56.340]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:07:04.651 --> 03:07:05.932]  Tyranny is here.
[03:07:05.932 --> 03:07:09.854]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:07:09.854 --> 03:07:12.095]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:07:12.095 --> 03:07:17.959]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:07:17.959 --> 03:07:24.203]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:07:24.603 --> 03:07:30.608]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:07:30.608 --> 03:07:34.772]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:07:34.772 --> 03:07:39.075]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:07:39.075 --> 03:07:45.020]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:07:45.020 --> 03:07:48.583]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:07:48.583 --> 03:07:50.544]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:07:50.544 --> 03:07:50.985]  It's here.
[03:07:51.645 --> 03:08:01.950]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:01.950 --> 03:08:07.513]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.267 --> 03:08:17.571]  The guests that we were going to have on, we're able to take collect calls here at our office.
[03:08:17.571 --> 03:08:20.934]  He rang through twice and then it said we're unable to accept collect calls.
[03:08:20.934 --> 03:08:24.517]  So strange things happening with the phone system.
[03:08:24.517 --> 03:08:27.540]  But we are working on getting Richard Fine on.
[03:08:27.540 --> 03:08:28.881]  Held for over a year in L.A.
[03:08:28.881 --> 03:08:31.163]  County Jail.
[03:08:31.163 --> 03:08:33.304]  But regardless, we'll get him on next week.
[03:08:33.304 --> 03:08:34.666]  We're unable to today.
[03:08:34.666 --> 03:08:37.068]  We have to get him a calling card.
[03:08:37.068 --> 03:08:40.510]  But earlier in the hour before last, we had one of the
[03:08:42.153 --> 03:08:42.633]  I think?
[03:09:12.693 --> 03:09:15.154]  No, when you expose it, you go to jail.
[03:09:15.154 --> 03:09:22.297]  No jury, no nothing, the judge who's being accused, and the evidence is there, it's admitted they did this, they send you to jail.
[03:09:22.297 --> 03:09:24.478]  And that's the essence of a tyranny.
[03:09:24.478 --> 03:09:30.041]  The essence of oppression is when there's no charges, no nothing, you just go to jail.
[03:09:30.041 --> 03:09:31.882]  And then you never get out.
[03:09:31.882 --> 03:09:33.782]  Because they don't like you.
[03:09:33.782 --> 03:09:35.923]  Let's talk to Debbie in California.
[03:09:35.923 --> 03:09:37.944]  Debbie, you're on the air, welcome.
[03:09:37.944 --> 03:09:41.646]  Hi Alex, I wanted to ask Bob about Silver, but since he's gone I'm going to report.
[03:09:42.276 --> 03:09:45.278]  About the Napa, California Tea Party.
[03:09:45.278 --> 03:09:51.042]  I basically got a death threat from someone because I was saying I was not into killing people in war.
[03:09:51.042 --> 03:09:52.904]  He said, um, I'd like to kill you.
[03:09:52.904 --> 03:09:53.604]  That was a bummer.
[03:09:53.604 --> 03:10:00.709]  Oh yeah, these war lovers, these war lovers think that all the Iraqis are dehumanized and they love the elite.
[03:10:00.709 --> 03:10:04.532]  They don't understand the elite see them as just as worthless as the Iraqis.
[03:10:04.532 --> 03:10:05.873]  I know, it's just unbelievable.
[03:10:09.582 --> 03:10:13.864]  Oh, we've got videos from across the country of them chanting, your taxes have been cut!
[03:10:13.864 --> 03:10:13.984]  No!
[03:10:13.984 --> 03:10:17.306]  The health care bill raises taxes.
[03:10:17.306 --> 03:10:19.587]  There are all these new tax increases involved.
[03:10:19.587 --> 03:10:21.949]  The government's spending too much.
[03:10:38.317 --> 03:10:38.717]  Yeah.
[03:10:54.211 --> 03:10:59.632]  And now Obama wants a value-added tax that will hit everybody in America.
[03:10:59.632 --> 03:11:02.813]  And they want carbon taxes that will hit everybody in America.
[03:11:02.813 --> 03:11:04.654]  But I watch these Democrats at these events.
[03:11:04.654 --> 03:11:09.195]  In fact, I sent you a video this morning of one just chanting, there is no tax!
[03:11:09.195 --> 03:11:10.355]  Our taxes are too low!
[03:11:10.355 --> 03:11:11.575]  They're ridiculously low!
[03:11:11.575 --> 03:11:13.336]  I mean, they're just mindless.
[03:11:13.336 --> 03:11:13.676]  Go ahead.
[03:11:13.996 --> 03:11:15.236]  Okay, so the 9-11 truth.
[03:11:15.236 --> 03:11:17.857]  I started asking people how many buildings went down.
[03:11:17.857 --> 03:11:20.478]  I got 7, 5, 10.
[03:11:20.478 --> 03:11:22.119]  No one knew how many buildings went down.
[03:11:22.119 --> 03:11:23.980]  I started talking to people, dialoguing.
[03:11:23.980 --> 03:11:25.100]  They all shouted me down.
[03:11:25.100 --> 03:11:26.381]  They told me to get away.
[03:11:26.381 --> 03:11:28.822]  We don't want conspiracy theorists here.
[03:11:28.822 --> 03:11:29.742]  Go away.
[03:11:29.742 --> 03:11:31.963]  I said, free speech, free speech.
[03:11:31.963 --> 03:11:35.824]  Most of them were neocon Republicans at this Napa tax party.
[03:11:35.824 --> 03:11:37.005]  So it was unfortunate.
[03:11:37.005 --> 03:11:41.246]  I did have signs that said, Bush, Obama, Wall Street, puppets.
[03:11:41.246 --> 03:11:43.007]  I had a sign, indict the banksters.
[03:11:44.748 --> 03:12:03.269]  Well look, the same military industrial complex that will give you Mitt Romney and Petraeus or Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin or Governor Perry, Rick Perry and Palin,
[03:12:03.729 --> 03:12:17.260]  They're going to give you exactly what you've been getting, and again, that's why we may lose this country, because you've got idiot Obama supporters, and you've got idiot mainline Republicans who just won't grow up and admit the world government is here.
[03:12:17.260 --> 03:12:21.403]  They all thought that Sarah Palin had started the Tea Party movement.
[03:12:21.403 --> 03:12:22.804]  Well, because the media keeps lying.
[03:12:22.804 --> 03:12:26.427]  It was Ron Paul's supporters, and that's on record.
[03:12:26.427 --> 03:12:28.268]  No one believed me, but anyways, I did my part.
[03:12:28.268 --> 03:12:28.749]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:12:29.616 --> 03:12:29.937]  I don't know.
[03:12:43.035 --> 03:12:49.239]  Pat Robertson clip, but first I want to play Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi saying global warming's real, we gotta do something.
[03:12:49.239 --> 03:12:57.664]  And then Newt Gingrich is finally being questioned by people at tea parties, and the rest of the tea party people are dragging them out.
[03:12:57.664 --> 03:12:59.466]  No, no, you don't bring that up!
[03:12:59.466 --> 03:13:00.266]  Newt's not for it!
[03:13:00.266 --> 03:13:08.592]  Newt's actually, well yes I am, and the Republicans are like, well then we better do it, I mean, you know, and Bill O'Reilly's for it, and Sarah Palin believes in global warming.
[03:13:08.592 --> 03:13:10.393]  I mean, I'm not gonna put up with this anymore!
[03:13:11.129 --> 03:13:12.573]  I'm done!
[03:13:12.573 --> 03:13:14.076]  Newt Gingrich is a globalist!
[03:13:14.076 --> 03:13:16.863]  Newt Gingrich is a piece of trash!
[03:13:16.863 --> 03:13:17.785]  Here is Newt Gingrich!
[03:13:18.767 --> 03:13:23.451]  Hi, I'm Nancy Pelosi, lifelong Democrat and Speaker of the House.
[03:13:23.451 --> 03:13:27.435]  And I'm Newt Gingrich, lifelong Republican and I used to be Speaker.
[03:13:27.435 --> 03:13:30.577]  We don't always see eye to eye, do we Newt?
[03:13:30.577 --> 03:13:35.381]  No, but we do agree our country must take action to address climate change.
[03:13:35.381 --> 03:13:38.444]  We need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast.
[03:13:38.444 --> 03:13:42.928]  If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.
[03:13:42.928 --> 03:13:45.189]  Go to wecansolveit.org.
[03:13:45.189 --> 03:13:46.671]  Together we can do this.
[03:13:48.436 --> 03:13:50.178]  And I'm supposed to put up with this from Newt.
[03:13:50.178 --> 03:13:52.059]  I mean, I know what Newt Gingrich has done.
[03:13:52.059 --> 03:13:54.121]  I know his voting record.
[03:13:54.121 --> 03:13:56.803]  I know who he is.
[03:13:56.803 --> 03:14:04.710]  He's for torture, warrantless spying, secret police, illegal wars, global carbon taxes.
[03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:07.613]  I mean, this guy is part of the New World Order big time.
[03:14:07.613 --> 03:14:10.475]  He's written books about world government and how great it is.
[03:14:10.475 --> 03:14:11.316]  I mean, he's a sicko.
[03:14:12.916 --> 03:14:16.078]  And it's the same thing with Pat Robertson.
[03:14:16.078 --> 03:14:17.258]  It's the same thing with Al Sharpton.
[03:14:17.258 --> 03:14:19.939]  They're all a bunch of sellouts to the New World Order and they control the left and right.
[03:14:19.939 --> 03:14:22.981]  It's like Mary Madeline, you know, Mary DeCarville.
[03:14:22.981 --> 03:14:33.085]  Or it's like all these husband and wife teams and, you know, the two brothers that are, you know, political hacks on the left and right.
[03:14:33.085 --> 03:14:38.428]  There are just so many examples of this and it's a joke to these people.
[03:14:39.264 --> 03:14:40.785]  Let's play the next clip.
[03:14:40.785 --> 03:14:43.326]  Now let's face it, we're polar opposites.
[03:14:43.326 --> 03:14:44.867]  We couldn't be further apart.
[03:14:44.867 --> 03:14:46.008]  I'm on the left.
[03:14:46.008 --> 03:14:47.568]  And I'm usually right.
[03:14:47.568 --> 03:14:49.369]  And we strongly disagree.
[03:14:49.369 --> 03:14:50.430]  Except on one issue.
[03:14:50.430 --> 03:14:52.591]  Tell them what it is, Reverend Pat.
[03:14:52.591 --> 03:14:54.132]  That would be our planet.
[03:14:54.132 --> 03:14:56.893]  Taking care of it is extremely important.
[03:14:56.893 --> 03:15:00.555]  We all need to work together, liberals and conservatives.
[03:15:00.555 --> 03:15:01.996]  So get involved.
[03:15:01.996 --> 03:15:03.997]  It's the right thing to do.
[03:15:03.997 --> 03:15:05.018]  Now there you go again.
[03:15:05.878 --> 03:15:06.558]  Join us.
[03:15:06.558 --> 03:15:08.639]  Together we can solve the climate crisis.
[03:15:08.639 --> 03:15:11.219]  Go to WeCanSolveIt.org.
[03:15:11.219 --> 03:15:27.083]  I mean, you've got the NFL, you've had the Republican leadership, you've had the Democratic leadership, you've had the Fortune 500 all lined up, the car makers, everybody, Exxon Mobil, the big oil companies founded the carbon tax, and they've got a new bill
[03:15:28.323 --> 03:15:32.484]  Introduce, this is out of alternate today, U.S.
[03:15:32.484 --> 03:15:35.105]  Senate climate bill to be unveiled April 26.
[03:15:35.105 --> 03:15:42.067]  They're back with another one with a gas tax, a federal gas tax.
[03:15:42.067 --> 03:15:45.908]  And they've got value-added taxes and taxes on all the factories and businesses.
[03:15:47.935 --> 03:15:50.776]  And have you read the last bill that passed the House and is in the Senate?
[03:15:50.776 --> 03:15:51.736]  Home inspections.
[03:15:51.736 --> 03:15:54.537]  I mean, you can't even imagine.
[03:15:54.537 --> 03:16:02.280]  This is global corporations with selective enforcement to shut down their competition and put taxes on everything you do.
[03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:06.842]  And they're back, and they're saying the Republicans and Lindsey Graham are gonna pass it.
[03:16:06.842 --> 03:16:09.183]  Remember Bush was for amnesty?
[03:16:09.183 --> 03:16:11.143]  And I get emails saying he was not for amnesty.
[03:16:11.143 --> 03:16:13.224]  I get emails saying he wasn't for the assault weapons ban.
[03:16:13.224 --> 03:16:14.405]  Yes, he was!
[03:16:14.405 --> 03:16:14.865]  Stop it!
[03:16:16.055 --> 03:16:18.157]  But see, Democrats don't like Republicans.
[03:16:18.157 --> 03:16:23.602]  So if Republicans attack Democrats, Democrats will support what the Democrats are doing no matter how bad it is.
[03:16:23.602 --> 03:16:27.806]  And if Democrats attack Republicans, then Republicans will support them.
[03:16:27.806 --> 03:16:34.232]  It's all moronic-level mind control.
[03:16:34.232 --> 03:16:37.495]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[03:16:37.495 --> 03:16:39.217]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut.
[03:16:39.217 --> 03:16:39.998]  George, you're on the air.
[03:16:41.718 --> 03:16:44.339]  Alex, I want to just keep one thing in mind.
[03:16:44.339 --> 03:16:45.739]  I have something I was going to add to this.
[03:16:45.739 --> 03:16:47.359]  This just came up as you were talking.
[03:16:47.359 --> 03:16:50.980]  They have to win on every front to really make this work.
[03:16:50.980 --> 03:16:53.681]  And that means not just in our country, in the world.
[03:16:53.681 --> 03:16:55.501]  And that's why they're going after the internet.
[03:16:55.501 --> 03:16:57.542]  That's why they're going after fossil fuel.
[03:16:57.542 --> 03:16:59.422]  That's why they're trying to go after farming.
[03:16:59.422 --> 03:17:01.763]  They're shutting everything off to make us dependent.
[03:17:01.763 --> 03:17:02.063]  Go ahead.
[03:17:03.004 --> 03:17:04.645]  The Chinese are not going to go along with it.
[03:17:04.645 --> 03:17:06.186]  They'll play along.
[03:17:06.186 --> 03:17:09.489]  I lived in Asia long enough, and I lived in Japan long enough.
[03:17:09.489 --> 03:17:13.031]  They're playing us for suckers because they'll play along for this game.
[03:17:13.031 --> 03:17:18.616]  And if they play this game and think they're going to win, they're going to lose because they're going to let their own trap fall in on them.
[03:17:18.616 --> 03:17:20.377]  They're going to pick up the pieces.
[03:17:20.377 --> 03:17:24.360]  I mean, this is a loser's game for these idiots.
[03:17:24.360 --> 03:17:25.961]  But the real issue is I'm thinking of
[03:17:26.408 --> 03:17:41.353]  Why don't we make up pamphleteers like they won the revolution and stick it in, call them truth pamphlets with bulletins, whether it's from you or from other sources that tell the people the truth, and stick them in the free newspapers and the regular newspapers.
[03:17:41.353 --> 03:17:43.473]  And say the real Tea Party!
[03:17:43.473 --> 03:17:48.095]  That's why Obama created the Coffee Party, because we had the idea to do it, to try to confuse everybody.
[03:17:49.255 --> 03:17:50.176]  It's just amazing.
[03:17:50.176 --> 03:17:52.098]  Yes, all of us have to get aggressive.
[03:17:52.098 --> 03:17:54.940]  There's more of us than there are Republicans and Democrats.
[03:17:54.940 --> 03:17:57.382]  Most people call themselves libertarians or independents.
[03:17:57.382 --> 03:18:01.105]  We have to just never shut up and engage on every front.
[03:18:02.441 --> 03:18:14.983]  And I think, I think, I don't know how much you're getting overseas in other languages, but if there are people out there that really are into this and can speak other languages, can write in other languages, get this out to other parties.
[03:18:14.983 --> 03:18:15.763]  Absolutely!
[03:18:15.763 --> 03:18:29.726]  My films and clips of the TV show and radio show are being translated into Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, German, Russian, Polish, Japanese, there's all sorts of translations out there.
[03:18:29.726 --> 03:18:30.326]  And we need more!
[03:18:30.326 --> 03:18:31.466]  We need more people to do that!
[03:18:32.591 --> 03:18:36.593]  Great, and the New York Times had an article I think you maybe wanted to look at quickly.
[03:18:36.593 --> 03:18:48.377]  It's just in today's Times on the 8th, 16th, that bastard Clinton basically is trying to tear down all the internet and saying that it's encouraging violence against the government and things like that.
[03:18:48.377 --> 03:18:49.197]  Oh yeah, no, no, no.
[03:18:49.197 --> 03:18:50.858]  They're in.
[03:18:50.858 --> 03:18:57.881]  Every day I see masses of articles where they're saying they're going to shut the web down as we know it and have a controlled internet with a few thousand channels.
[03:18:57.881 --> 03:18:58.841]  It's all being announced.
[03:19:00.171 --> 03:19:09.875]  We're all in an echo chamber trying to, basically he's trying to say we're in some sort of padded cell and that we're creating our own violent tendencies.
[03:19:09.875 --> 03:19:11.116]  They don't seem to get it.
[03:19:11.116 --> 03:19:19.319]  They know people are upset about losing their standard of living and their basic freedoms, and so they're going, you people are crazy.
[03:19:19.319 --> 03:19:20.520]  You don't love your government.
[03:19:20.520 --> 03:19:22.621]  We're going to shut down your ways to communicate.
[03:19:23.181 --> 03:19:24.642]  You understand us?
[03:19:24.642 --> 03:19:27.184]  But we have to understand how late it is.
[03:19:27.184 --> 03:19:28.405]  We're kicking their butt.
[03:19:28.405 --> 03:19:30.006]  We're starting to turn the tide.
[03:19:30.006 --> 03:19:32.287]  And so they're going to turn over the chessboard here.
[03:19:32.287 --> 03:19:35.409]  So we better use the internet while we still can.
[03:19:35.409 --> 03:19:36.830]  Push for the freedom.
[03:19:36.830 --> 03:19:38.572]  Push for it to stay open.
[03:19:38.572 --> 03:19:40.393]  But also develop other systems.
[03:19:40.393 --> 03:19:43.395]  That's why the DVDs and the films are so important on hard copy.
[03:19:43.955 --> 03:19:48.921]  Everybody get the entire library at InfoWars.com so you have that arsenal.
[03:19:48.921 --> 03:19:50.643]  These films are evergreen.
[03:19:50.643 --> 03:19:52.525]  Fall of the Republic is so important.
[03:19:52.525 --> 03:19:53.486]  God bless you, my friend.
[03:19:53.486 --> 03:19:55.248]  I appreciate your call.
[03:19:55.248 --> 03:19:59.353]  We'll be back with more calls and a bunch of other important news straight ahead.
[03:19:59.353 --> 03:19:59.814]  Stay with us.
[03:20:06.134 --> 03:20:11.058]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:20:11.058 --> 03:20:13.560]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:20:13.560 --> 03:20:19.425]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:20:19.425 --> 03:20:25.651]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:20:26.091 --> 03:20:32.076]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[03:24:11.730 --> 03:24:19.994]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, his phone calls to us are getting blocked somehow, but he's able to get through on a calling card.
[03:24:19.994 --> 03:24:22.695]  And this is a very important case of Richard Fine.
[03:24:22.695 --> 03:24:23.415]  Here's the headline.
[03:24:23.415 --> 03:24:23.735]  The U.S.
[03:24:23.735 --> 03:24:31.119]  Supreme Court will consider the case of a 70-year-old taxpayer advocate, Richard Fine, who has languished in jail for more than a year.
[03:24:31.119 --> 03:24:32.699]  This is an amazing story.
[03:24:32.699 --> 03:24:35.921]  He's a former federal antitrust lawyer, Ph.D.
[03:24:37.181 --> 03:24:39.882]  Uh, and it is admitted that judges in L.A.
[03:24:39.882 --> 03:24:44.884]  County are being paid money under the table, similar to the case MSNBC reports on.
[03:24:44.884 --> 03:24:47.645]  Two judges plead guilty in sending kids to lockup.
[03:24:47.645 --> 03:24:53.307]  Pair admit they got $2.6 million in payoffs to put away young people in a private facility.
[03:24:53.307 --> 03:24:57.128]  So this is going on everywhere, but no jury, no charges.
[03:24:57.128 --> 03:25:01.710]  Over a year in jail because he's been exposing the very judge that put him in jail.
[03:25:02.230 --> 03:25:07.153]  Now, this is the essence of tyranny, what we see in the Declaration of Independence, what we were fighting against.
[03:25:07.153 --> 03:25:08.774]  Richard Fine, you've got the floor.
[03:25:08.774 --> 03:25:11.175]  Tell people what's happened to you.
[03:25:11.175 --> 03:25:18.979]  Okay, well, what has happened to me, very simply, is that I exposed the scheme under which L.A.
[03:25:18.979 --> 03:25:23.401]  County Supervisors have paid over $300 million.
[03:25:23.401 --> 03:25:26.003]  Your call may be monitored or recorded.
[03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:30.012]  In the last 23 years to the L.A.
[03:25:30.012 --> 03:25:32.893]  County Superior Court Judges.
[03:25:32.893 --> 03:25:41.118]  Now the interesting thing about this is that the Superior Court Judges are state elected judges.
[03:25:41.118 --> 03:25:44.419]  They have absolutely no relationship to L.A.
[03:25:44.419 --> 03:25:45.900]  County.
[03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:51.523]  These judges are elected in state elections, they're state officials, and they're state employees.
[03:25:52.677 --> 03:25:59.244]  And what happened approximately 23 years ago in the late 1980s, the L.A.
[03:25:59.244 --> 03:26:12.438]  County Supervisors decided that they were going to pay sitting judges money to attract and retain qualified judges to sit in L.A.
[03:26:12.438 --> 03:26:12.738]  County.
[03:26:13.496 --> 03:26:23.260]  Well, this is totally ridiculous because of the fact that you can't attract a sitting judge to become a judge.
[03:26:23.260 --> 03:26:27.542]  And you can't retain a sitting judge to become a judge because the judges are elected.
[03:26:28.334 --> 03:26:32.416]  So you can't give them money to attract them to have a job that they already have.
[03:26:32.416 --> 03:26:36.977]  And courts... And courts are ready to retain a job for which they're elected.
[03:26:36.977 --> 03:26:51.243]  And precedent shows this is basically illegal, but they're doing it in plain view, right out in the open, and you have a conflict of interest now, where in all these years, the counties only lost three lawsuits because they pay the judges.
[03:26:51.243 --> 03:26:51.663]  That's right.
[03:26:51.663 --> 03:26:55.384]  Now, interestingly enough, Alex, it wasn't out in the open.
[03:26:55.384 --> 03:26:56.785]  The way that they did it,
[03:26:57.698 --> 03:27:00.041]  They did it through the budget process.
[03:27:00.041 --> 03:27:05.187]  And in the budget, there was an item called trial court funding.
[03:27:05.187 --> 03:27:08.570]  And they just plugged it into trial court funding.
[03:27:08.570 --> 03:27:14.197]  And there really was no way that the public really saw that this was money going to the judges.
[03:27:15.444 --> 03:27:22.927]  The only way you could find it is if you could find maybe a footnote that would say it's part of trial court funding, that the money would be paid in cash.
[03:27:22.927 --> 03:27:23.567]  The judges were getting...
[03:27:35.939 --> 03:27:37.340]  In 2007 and 2008, they were getting $46,366 per judge per year.
[03:27:37.340 --> 03:27:38.622]  And there are 430 judges in L.A.
[03:27:38.622 --> 03:27:38.822]  County.
[03:27:38.822 --> 03:27:39.563]  On top of their state paycheck.
[03:27:52.944 --> 03:27:54.225]  Yeah, their state paycheck was $178,000 a year, plus $30,000 in benefits.
[03:27:54.225 --> 03:27:56.848]  So the judges were basically taking home about $250,000 a year.
[03:27:56.848 --> 03:28:02.113]  That is more than the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, who only takes home $218,000 a year.
[03:28:13.024 --> 03:28:18.485]  Now, this is across the board, by the way, throughout California.
[03:28:18.485 --> 03:28:24.387]  55 out of the 58 counties in California is paying extra money to the U.S.
[03:28:24.387 --> 03:28:28.928]  Not all of them are paying as much money as L.A.
[03:28:28.928 --> 03:28:32.869]  County, however, some of them are only paying a few thousand dollars.
[03:28:32.869 --> 03:28:36.790]  In fact, in our latest report that came out this year,
[03:28:37.541 --> 03:28:44.103]  I think it's $33 million is being paid to judges throughout California.
[03:28:44.103 --> 03:28:45.803]  $23 million of it is being paid in L.A.
[03:28:45.803 --> 03:28:47.264]  County.
[03:28:47.264 --> 03:28:48.044]  Unbelievable.
[03:28:48.044 --> 03:28:58.446]  And so you start exposing this, you start challenging cases where there's a major conflict of interest and they throw you in jail and they're not charging you and you've been there for a year?
[03:28:58.446 --> 03:29:00.587]  I mean, are they saying you'll be there forever?
[03:29:01.817 --> 03:29:16.328]  Well, they wanted to keep me here until I tell them what my assets are so that they can grab my assets based upon a ruling that this Judge Yaffe made that I should pay money to L.A.
[03:29:16.328 --> 03:29:17.349]  County.
[03:29:17.349 --> 03:29:23.954]  Because what happened in this particular case is, and this is also very interesting because this shows you how deep the corruption is,
[03:29:24.770 --> 03:29:32.076]  What happened in this case, and the case is called Marina Strand Colony 2... Richard, Richard, we got a break.
[03:29:32.076 --> 03:29:33.758]  We got a break for the network and satellites.
[03:29:33.758 --> 03:29:34.758]  We're back in three minutes.
[03:29:34.758 --> 03:29:35.219]  Stay there.
[03:29:35.219 --> 03:29:37.961]  We hope they don't cut you off.
[03:29:37.961 --> 03:29:48.009]  And I've seen cases on CNN where the judges come out in Texas and admit they're getting the money from people's cars they take and wallets they take with no drugs or anything.
[03:29:48.009 --> 03:29:49.591]  It's just lawlessness.
[03:29:49.591 --> 03:29:50.572]  It's going on everywhere.
[03:29:51.752 --> 03:29:54.753]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.753 --> 03:30:01.496]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.496 --> 03:30:08.140]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:30:08.140 --> 03:30:13.282]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:30:13.282 --> 03:30:20.025]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:30:22.011 --> 03:30:28.403]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[03:30:30.393 --> 03:30:35.095]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:30:35.095 --> 03:30:38.917]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[03:30:38.917 --> 03:30:40.158]  Others don't.
[03:30:40.158 --> 03:30:42.299]  We turn jeans inside out.

[03:32:54.638 --> 03:33:05.326]  Richard Fine is our guest, a very distinguished criminal investigator, formerly with the Justice Department, Antitrust,
[03:33:17.560 --> 03:33:21.723]  I have a lot of other great people that are working with him.
[03:33:21.723 --> 03:33:27.766]  Emmy award-winning researcher Leslie Dutton, filmmaker.
[03:33:27.766 --> 03:33:35.511]  The details are online at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and some of the other great sites that are out there.
[03:33:35.511 --> 03:33:38.953]  FullDisclosure.net as well, FullDisclosure.net.
[03:33:38.953 --> 03:33:46.558]  But the Supreme Court, out of 10,000 cases a year, has decided to start hearing this case at the preliminary level next
[03:33:47.449 --> 03:33:51.390]  What happened, Alex, is that we went through all the courts.
[03:33:51.390 --> 03:33:52.710]  We went through the California Superior Court.
[03:34:07.515 --> 03:34:14.078]  No, we went to the California Court of Appeals, the California Supreme Court.
[03:34:14.078 --> 03:34:14.699]  I didn't know that.
[03:34:14.699 --> 03:34:21.142]  I guess there's several cases involved then, but I mean to be clear, give us the name of the case.
[03:34:21.142 --> 03:34:26.544]  The name of the case that you're calling is not monitored or recorded.
[03:34:26.544 --> 03:34:34.268]  The name of the case that the Supreme Court is going to be hearing is Richard I. Fine vs. the Sheriff of Los Angeles County.
[03:34:35.279 --> 03:34:38.723]  And that's the case that I'm being held on.
[03:34:38.723 --> 03:34:48.893]  The underlying case is the case of Marina Strand Colony 2 Homeowners Association versus the County of Los Angeles.
[03:34:48.893 --> 03:34:53.078]  And that's the case that we started talking about right before the break.
[03:34:53.078 --> 03:34:56.962]  Now the interesting thing about that case is that shows even more corruption.
[03:34:57.728 --> 03:35:09.738]  Because what happened in that case is you had a developer and the developer's company name was Delray Shores Joint Venture and Delray Shores Joint Venture North.
[03:35:09.738 --> 03:35:14.843]  But it was owned by the managing partner is a guy by the name of Jerry B. Epstein.
[03:35:16.154 --> 03:35:26.481]  Epstein and his chief of staff, Robert David O. Levine, that is, they gave money to campaign contributions.
[03:35:26.481 --> 03:35:27.721]  Sound familiar?
[03:35:27.721 --> 03:35:35.866]  To the two supervisors, Michael Antonovich and Don Cannabi.
[03:35:35.866 --> 03:35:40.469]  And they gave this money to Cannabi and Antonovich in April of 2007.
[03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:44.712]  Now remember that date, because here's how the story comes down the line.
[03:35:46.008 --> 03:35:51.670]  These people wanted to redevelop the apartment complex in Marina Del Rey, California.
[03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:57.952]  And they wanted to expand it to 250-some units, 500-some units.
[03:35:57.952 --> 03:36:02.393]  In order to do that, they needed an environmental impact report.
[03:36:02.393 --> 03:36:06.854]  And as part of the environmental impact report, they show how it's going to affect the environment.
[03:36:06.854 --> 03:36:12.556]  And one of the other things, you have to show that it'll have a positive financial impact on L.A.
[03:36:12.556 --> 03:36:12.756]  County.
[03:36:13.934 --> 03:36:23.421]  Uh, the interesting thing here is that Marina Del Rey is the largest yacht, uh, small craft yacht harbor in the United States.
[03:36:23.421 --> 03:36:29.505]  It started out with 6,000, 6,000 boats, and it's now down to about 4,000.
[03:36:29.505 --> 03:36:42.755]  The county owns the land, and what the county does is the county leases out the land to these developers who put apartment complexes on the land, and then they end up paying the county for the use of the land.
[03:36:43.507 --> 03:36:46.868]  I'm going to digress slightly here to show you how bad this is.
[03:36:46.868 --> 03:36:57.211]  These developers are making, they're taking in about $350 million a year in rent from these apartments.
[03:36:57.211 --> 03:37:01.672]  They pay the county approximately $35 million a year for the land.
[03:37:02.734 --> 03:37:07.978]  They should be paying the county approximately a hundred million dollars a year for the land.
[03:37:07.978 --> 03:37:09.940]  So the people, the taxpayers in L.A.
[03:37:09.940 --> 03:37:16.505]  County are losing seventy million dollars a year in land rent from the developers.
[03:37:16.505 --> 03:37:22.570]  In the last ten years, the taxpayers in Los Angeles County have lost approximately a billion dollars in rent.
[03:37:23.796 --> 03:37:26.077]  Your phone will be monitored or recorded.
[03:37:45.365 --> 03:37:49.808]  Let's be clear, let's be clear, because I notice that all the time in Austin where I live.
[03:37:49.808 --> 03:38:04.837]  I've got to pay all these property taxes, business taxes, but big corporations come in, they make political contributions, and the city says, we waive your property tax for 10 years, we waive your environmental fees, we waive everything, because they've made political contributions.
[03:38:04.837 --> 03:38:08.980]  But separately to me here, the big case, regardless, is that I've
[03:38:09.680 --> 03:38:19.529]  I'm no lawyer, but I know the Supreme Court has held over and over again that the police can't hold you for more than five days without basically charging you.
[03:38:19.529 --> 03:38:22.351]  So they're violating habeas corpus here, are they not?
[03:38:22.351 --> 03:38:26.415]  That's right, and that's the case that's up before the Supreme Court.
[03:38:26.415 --> 03:38:30.038]  But let me get through the back bar to show you how we get to that case.
[03:38:30.828 --> 03:38:31.569]  He must recuse!
[03:38:59.655 --> 03:39:07.040]  Well, Kenobi and Antonovich both advocated and voted on the project.
[03:39:07.040 --> 03:39:08.641]  Now, there were four votes.
[03:39:08.641 --> 03:39:15.024]  So, two of them were illegal, which meant that the EIR, the vote on the EIR was illegal.
[03:39:15.024 --> 03:39:20.448]  I came in and I sued to stop that EIR in the court.
[03:39:20.448 --> 03:39:22.809]  And we came in in front of Judge Yaffe.
[03:39:22.809 --> 03:39:26.551]  Now, what happened is that Judge Yaffe is getting this $46,000 from the county.
[03:39:29.427 --> 03:39:32.289]  So you know what happened.
[03:39:32.289 --> 03:39:36.931]  It turns out that Judge Yaffe allows the thing to go through.
[03:39:36.931 --> 03:39:41.774]  Now, during the course of this case, we have another thing that happened.
[03:39:41.774 --> 03:39:44.895]  We have the State Bar making me inactive.
[03:39:44.895 --> 03:39:55.360]  And the sad part of that is that the judges have gone to the State Bar to try and get me disbarred and be inactive because I had brought the same type of case against the judges back in 2002.
[03:39:57.273 --> 03:39:58.414]  And did you win that previous case?
[03:39:58.414 --> 03:40:00.016]  Did you win that previous case?
[03:40:12.071 --> 03:40:15.954]  It was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds in the federal court.
[03:40:15.954 --> 03:40:25.519]  However, in 2008, the California Court of Appeals held that these payments were illegal and unaccountable.
[03:40:25.519 --> 03:40:34.084]  Start over, start over, because again, our friend is a political prisoner in jail, Richard Fine, right now, so they keep popping in with the call may be monitored.
[03:40:34.084 --> 03:40:35.685]  Now, now, now, now, go back.
[03:40:35.685 --> 03:40:38.967]  So you had the California Court of Appeals rule in favor of you.
[03:40:40.288 --> 03:40:44.591]  Because you were citing another ruling.
[03:40:44.591 --> 03:40:47.073]  Please continue.
[03:40:47.073 --> 03:40:55.360]  The California Court of Appeals held in 2008 in a case called Sturgeon v. The County of Los Angeles that the payments by L.A.
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:41:01.845]  County to the judges violated Article VI, Section 19 of the California Constitution.
[03:41:01.845 --> 03:41:05.107]  And that was the exact thing that I claimed in my 2002 case.
[03:41:07.378 --> 03:41:13.899]  So what the State Bar was doing to me was violating what the California Court of Appeals was holding to be true.
[03:41:14.400 --> 03:41:16.481]  Let me stop you again.
[03:41:16.481 --> 03:41:20.664]  Cities are chartered under the state constitution through the counties.
[03:41:20.664 --> 03:41:23.645]  The power comes from the state and the elected legislature.
[03:41:23.645 --> 03:41:27.267]  This is ass-backwards, as they say, where L.A.
[03:41:27.267 --> 03:41:32.230]  County is trying to absorb and take the judges literally under its control.
[03:41:32.230 --> 03:41:34.431]  But Sacramento's not concerned about that.
[03:41:34.431 --> 03:41:42.316]  The Court of Appeals was and ruled for you because then didn't they quietly pass a law, if I read this right, giving immunity to these judges?
[03:41:43.516 --> 03:41:44.417]  You're absolutely right.
[03:41:44.417 --> 03:42:06.856]  What happened is that after the Sturgeon decision came down, what the state did is that the state legislature passed a law saying that they gave retroactive immunity to the supervisors and the judges from criminal prosecution, civil liability, and disciplinary action.
[03:42:08.902 --> 03:42:11.164]  Because they know that these people have done wrong.
[03:42:11.164 --> 03:42:13.926]  And the criminal part of it was misappropriation of funds.
[03:42:13.926 --> 03:42:15.807]  So what happened is that I left the case in 2007.
[03:42:15.807 --> 03:42:16.528]  In 2008, Judge Yaffe
[03:42:38.917 --> 03:42:43.562]  He ordered me to pay money to the county without any notice to me.
[03:42:43.562 --> 03:42:47.046]  I was gone from this case in October 2007.
[03:42:47.046 --> 03:42:54.936]  In January 2008, Judge Jaffe orders me to pay money to the county because I filed a paper one day late.
[03:42:54.936 --> 03:42:58.259]  The county had filed their papers 60 days late.
[03:42:58.259 --> 03:42:59.501]  He did nothing to the county.
[03:43:00.610 --> 03:43:07.594]  And he orders me to pay money to the county without any notice to me, without my being present at the hearing.
[03:43:07.594 --> 03:43:10.656]  And I came in and I said, Judge, you can't do that.
[03:43:10.656 --> 03:43:13.397]  Because number one, you're violating the Constitution.
[03:43:13.397 --> 03:43:21.281]  But number two, you're getting payments from the county.
[03:43:21.281 --> 03:43:27.004]  And now Yaffe has not disclosed, at this point, your phone may be monitored or recorded.
[03:43:27.004 --> 03:43:29.866]  Yaffe has not disclosed that he was getting payments from the county.
[03:43:30.811 --> 03:43:34.933]  And the county had not disclosed that they knew that EIR was illegal.
[03:43:34.933 --> 03:43:38.495]  And nor had Epstein disclosed that he knew that it was illegal.
[03:43:38.495 --> 03:43:45.158]  I then got Yaffe to admit, on the record, at a court hearing that he was getting these payments.
[03:43:45.158 --> 03:43:49.861]  And then I disqualified Yaffe, and Yaffe refused to leave the case.
[03:43:49.861 --> 03:43:55.784]  And then Yaffe ordered me to make the payment to disclose my assets.
[03:43:56.736 --> 03:43:59.862]  To have that order enforced.
[03:43:59.862 --> 03:44:01.785]  And I refused to do that.
[03:44:01.785 --> 03:44:04.891]  Then Yaffe had a contempt hearing.
[03:44:04.891 --> 03:44:09.840]  At which point, in the contempt hearing, I got Yaffe to testify as the first witness.
[03:44:10.538 --> 03:44:15.823]  I got him to testify that he was receiving the payments, that he was not disclosing the payments.
[03:44:15.823 --> 03:44:19.386]  I mean, he should instantly, hold on, he should instantly recuse himself.
[03:44:19.386 --> 03:44:25.352]  Federal, state, law, I mean, all of the precedent says he must recuse himself.
[03:44:25.352 --> 03:44:29.016]  He's a witness in the courtroom when he's the judge.
[03:44:29.016 --> 03:44:31.178]  I mean, this is insanity.
[03:44:31.178 --> 03:44:33.260]  It truly is insanity.
[03:44:33.260 --> 03:44:35.542]  It violates every Supreme Court precedent.
[03:44:36.813 --> 03:44:50.886]  Well, that's like the Secretary of State in Kentucky, with the State Ethics Board ruling, he can run his own election against Rand Paul for Senate in Kentucky, never before done, and so he runs his own election.
[03:45:06.681 --> 03:45:09.543]  I mean, it is total insanity.
[03:45:09.543 --> 03:45:15.926]  I mean, this judge is ending up taking a bribe, and then he's judging his own actions of taking a bribe.
[03:45:15.926 --> 03:45:16.546]  Every U.S.
[03:45:16.546 --> 03:45:19.347]  Supreme Court precedent is against that.
[03:45:19.347 --> 03:45:34.075]  So, anyway, the end result of it is that Yaffe holds me in contempt for not answering, saying that I have to... holds me in contempt, but throws me in jail under coercive confinement.
[03:45:47.180 --> 03:45:53.443]  So now, via a civil judgment, no jury, no nothing, you're in jail more than a year.
[03:45:53.443 --> 03:46:02.428]  This is a dangerous precedent if it's allowed to stand, and we know the Supreme Court earlier in the year, you've had some of the other justices refuse it, but now Ginsburg is accepting it.
[03:46:04.514 --> 03:46:05.614]  I'm sorry you got blocked out.
[03:46:05.614 --> 03:46:08.175]  You said the Supreme Court earlier in the year.
[03:46:08.175 --> 03:46:10.176]  Well, I mean, I've read over the case.
[03:46:10.176 --> 03:46:11.936]  Tell me if I'm right.
[03:46:11.936 --> 03:46:16.818]  Wasn't it Justice Stevens, or which one is it that earlier?
[03:46:16.818 --> 03:46:20.038]  Justice Kennedy earlier in the year denied my application.
[03:46:20.038 --> 03:46:22.499]  And then I went to Justice Ginsburg.
[03:46:22.499 --> 03:46:26.180]  And Justice Ginsburg was the one who called and maybe monitored or recorded.
[03:46:26.180 --> 03:46:28.941]  Alright, so there... Tell us what's gonna...
[03:46:30.123 --> 03:46:30.563]  Sure, sure.
[03:46:30.563 --> 03:46:31.564]  So we're running out of time.
[03:46:31.564 --> 03:46:37.786]  So tell us, Mr. Feige, the show's almost over here and we appreciate you joining us from prison, from your political dungeon.
[03:46:37.786 --> 03:46:40.747]  So what's happened in jail?
[03:46:40.747 --> 03:46:48.070]  I mean, if the Supreme Court says no, I guess you'll live out the rest of the 10, 15, 20 years there and the taxpayers will pay for it?
[03:46:48.450 --> 03:46:49.911]  That could be the case.
[03:46:49.911 --> 03:46:55.372]  It's really up to the Supreme Court to follow their confidence and basically set me free.
[03:46:55.372 --> 03:46:57.593]  That's where we're sitting at.
[03:46:57.593 --> 03:47:04.375]  One of the things I do want to mention before we close out is that there's going to be a rally
[03:47:17.970 --> 03:47:22.897]  For me on Tuesday the 20th of April at the L.A.
[03:47:22.897 --> 03:47:28.424]  County Courthouse which is at Wedding Lane, North Hill Street in Los Angeles.
[03:47:28.424 --> 03:47:33.511]  And it's going to start at 7.30 in the morning when the judges come in to park their cars.
[03:47:42.122 --> 03:47:53.206]  And there's also one coming up at the Supreme Court, and we went over that two hours ago when we had Leslie Dutton on, and people can find out all the details at fulldisclosure.net.
[03:47:53.206 --> 03:47:55.247]  But sir, in the video interview I've seen,
[03:47:56.567 --> 03:47:57.428]  I mean, go back over.
[03:47:57.428 --> 03:48:01.832]  This is why we went to war against the British in 1775-76.
[03:48:01.832 --> 03:48:09.279]  It's in the Declaration of Independence as the list of abuses, the exact same stuff that's being done to you.
[03:48:09.279 --> 03:48:16.505]  Talk about how, I mean, as a lawyer, as a former federal investigator, what this is like for people that don't understand the law.
[03:48:23.049 --> 03:48:28.591]  Well, you talked about the parallels between this and the Declaration of Independence, and how big a deal this is.
[03:48:28.591 --> 03:48:44.638]  Well, the big deal is that it's a vast parallel, because when you go to the last part of the Declaration of Independence, and you read that last part, that talks about the fact that the king controlled all the judges in the court.
[03:48:46.201 --> 03:48:57.165]  And therefore there was absolutely no way that anyone in the colonies had any opportunity to get any fairness in the judicial system in England.
[03:48:57.165 --> 03:48:59.766]  And that was one of the reasons why we went to war.
[03:48:59.766 --> 03:49:02.747]  That is why we had a revolution.
[03:49:02.747 --> 03:49:06.608]  And this right now is our new revolution.
[03:49:06.608 --> 03:49:10.669]  Except for we don't have to use guns at this point in time.
[03:49:10.669 --> 03:49:12.630]  We are using the democratic process.
[03:49:13.442 --> 03:49:26.666]  And by using the democratic process we are coming through and we are going to go in and as I'm doing I am using the court system because I have a basic belief Your call may be monitored or recorded.
[03:49:26.666 --> 03:49:39.930]  I have a basic belief that the United States Supreme Court is going to uphold all of the precedents and these precedents that a judge can't judge his own actions go all the way back to the 16th century and started out in common law.
[03:49:42.264 --> 03:49:51.016]  So what are you expecting to do with Baca, the sheriff, these judges, if the Supreme Court tells them to let you out of jail?
[03:49:51.016 --> 03:49:54.421]  Are they going to go in there and claim that you've committed suicide or something?
[03:49:54.421 --> 03:49:55.943]  You're not planning to commit suicide, are you?
[03:49:57.922 --> 03:50:03.126]  I've survived, actually, I've survived ten years of this abuse.
[03:50:03.126 --> 03:50:09.230]  These judges started this whole thing out way back in 1999, trying to economically break me.
[03:50:09.230 --> 03:50:17.015]  As a friend of mine said, if they had the ability to shoot me, they probably would have, but luckily they don't think in those terms.
[03:50:17.015 --> 03:50:21.718]  They probably think in those terms and probably don't have the guts to execute it.
[03:50:21.718 --> 03:50:22.478]  Thank God for me.
[03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:29.363]  Well, my plan is a very simple thing, and I call it the 3 A's.
[03:50:29.363 --> 03:50:32.344]  It's awareness, attachment, and action.
[03:50:32.344 --> 03:50:35.186]  And it means, it's due to people like yourself.
[03:50:35.186 --> 03:50:38.048]  People become aware of what is happening.
[03:50:38.048 --> 03:50:42.671]  And then, they attach to what is happening by picking up with that awareness.
[03:50:42.671 --> 03:50:44.332]  And the third thing becomes action.
[03:50:44.332 --> 03:50:47.574]  And as I said in my video, you vote the bums out.
[03:50:48.394 --> 03:50:54.939]  Because what takes place is that we are the ones that actually have the ability to do things.
[03:50:54.939 --> 03:50:55.799]  Richard Fine!
[03:50:55.799 --> 03:50:57.200]  Richard Fine!
[03:50:57.200 --> 03:50:57.941]  We got a break.
[03:50:57.941 --> 03:50:59.462]  Final segment after this break.
[03:50:59.462 --> 03:50:59.982]  Stay with us.
[03:50:59.982 --> 03:51:02.004]  We'll come back with some final comments from you.

[03:51:03.805 --> 03:51:05.627]  You may have storable food questions.
[03:51:05.627 --> 03:51:10.150]  You may want to buy your freeze-dried foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[03:51:10.450 --> 03:51:12.252]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy.

[03:54:14.498 --> 03:54:18.721]  All over the country, judges are being paid off under the table.
[03:54:18.721 --> 03:54:20.422]  I'll take you back to MSNBC.
[03:54:20.422 --> 03:54:23.724]  Two judges plead guilty to sending kids to lock up who were innocent.
[03:54:23.724 --> 03:54:31.669]  Hare paid $2.6 million in payoff to put away young offenders in a private prison that's in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.
[03:54:32.569 --> 03:54:43.039]  We're almost out of time here, Richard Fine, but this is a 1776 issue and all the precedents, as you said, clearly show this is out of control.
[03:54:43.039 --> 03:54:46.061]  Have you seen the judge lately?
[03:54:46.061 --> 03:54:47.082]  Are they still arrogant?
[03:54:47.082 --> 03:54:49.625]  Are your jailers proud of the system they're a part of?
[03:54:51.792 --> 03:54:53.894]  No, the judge refuses to see me.
[03:54:53.894 --> 03:55:09.214]  I filed a full abortion under what we call the FAR case, which demands that I be set free, because to hold me coercively, the case says that when the coercion isn't going to work, it becomes penal, and when it's penal, I have to be out within five days.
[03:55:09.781 --> 03:55:14.564]  So basically I should have been out of here by March 9th, 2009.
[03:55:14.564 --> 03:55:17.066]  This judge is basically in hiding.
[03:55:17.066 --> 03:55:21.049]  He's in caps and stuff in the courthouse and is not about to come out.
[03:55:21.049 --> 03:55:26.253]  As far as my jailers are concerned, the guards here... Your phone may be monitored or recorded.
[03:55:26.253 --> 03:55:29.275]  The guards here are basically on my side.
[03:55:29.275 --> 03:55:29.795]  Good!
[03:55:29.795 --> 03:55:31.777]  The internal people that take care of me.
[03:55:31.777 --> 03:55:34.338]  Because these guys are trying to do a job.
[03:55:34.338 --> 03:55:37.360]  And they are just as bad as every other citizen.
[03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:37.801]  Good!
[03:55:37.801 --> 03:55:38.801]  In their own personal rights.
[03:55:39.762 --> 03:55:43.484]  They're with us on this type of thing.
[03:55:43.484 --> 03:55:48.107]  So getting to the bottom line, we the people are the ones with the power.
[03:55:48.107 --> 03:55:50.028]  We're the ones that have the vote.
[03:55:50.028 --> 03:55:52.629]  And we're the ones that can vote these people out.
[03:55:52.629 --> 03:55:59.113]  And you have these political consultants and all these candidates spending all this money to influence us.
[03:55:59.113 --> 03:56:03.675]  And all we have to do is just be aware of what's happening and get in there and vote
[03:56:05.362 --> 03:56:11.550]  Well, sir, I would imagine the power structure is starting to get scared.
[03:56:11.550 --> 03:56:14.133]  This is now going to the Supreme Court last week.
[03:56:14.133 --> 03:56:15.535]  We appreciate your perseverance.
[03:56:15.535 --> 03:56:18.178]  We're all going to be praying for you, Mr. Fine.
[03:56:18.178 --> 03:56:21.883]  We'll track this next week and the week after that, and we're in your corner.
[03:56:21.883 --> 03:56:22.563]  God bless you.
[03:56:22.563 --> 03:56:23.505]  Go with God, my friend.
[03:56:27.506 --> 03:56:28.666]  You too, sir.
[03:56:28.666 --> 03:56:29.427]  All right, there you go.
[03:56:29.427 --> 03:56:36.008]  Richard Fein, another political prisoner here in America with a K. What an amazing week of broadcast.
[03:56:36.008 --> 03:56:38.149]  So much happening, so much coming out.
[03:56:38.149 --> 03:56:39.669]  The people awakening.
[03:56:39.669 --> 03:56:45.411]  The establishment being exposed, shitting provocateurs at tea parties in Nazi outfits.
[03:56:45.411 --> 03:56:47.651]  And to discredit, it's not working.
[03:56:47.651 --> 03:56:48.872]  People are waking up.
[03:56:48.872 --> 03:56:49.712]  They're finding out

[03:57:27.068 --> 03:57:35.815]  It exposes how torture is wrong and how people are more and more only caring about possessions and how they don't form relationships with humans but do it with computers.
[03:57:35.815 --> 03:57:39.218]  It's called iPad Torture to Death in Mass Social Experiment.
