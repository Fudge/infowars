[00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:16.199]  We're good.
[00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:46.784]  I'm very happy to have Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:50.526]  Now, I've known about Alex Jones for more than a decade.
[00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:56.329]  For those of you who listen to the Saturday Special, I've had him on two or three times in the last decade.
[00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.510]  I knew he was a great, great guest.
[00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.512]  They don't make better guests than Alex Jones.
[00:01:02.693 --> 00:01:06.955]  And I knew that he hosted his own radio show.
[00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:08.116]  A television show, too!
[00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:11.798]  But I knew that he hosted his own syndicated radio show.
[00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:19.630]  But I never really thought that it would be appropriate for this particular area.
[00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:21.552]  And boy was I wrong!
[00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:39.725]  Okay, this is the man, whom I've known for almost 20 years, who wouldn't stop!
[00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.785]  It's like a Gila monster!
[00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:45.727]  And I have to say that!
[00:01:46.887 --> 00:01:51.188]  Glenn would not stop working on me, saying, you've got to put Alex Jones on KFCO.
[00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:53.229]  You will be amazed at what happens!
[00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:04.304]  And every day that passes, I'm more astounded.
[00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.304]  Now, I'm real curious.
[00:02:06.904 --> 00:02:09.725]  The light's sort of blinding you, so I keep doing the visor thing.
[00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:18.867]  How many of you in this room are here because you heard about Alex Jones being here at this event on KSEO or KMY?
[00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:19.547]  Show of hands, please.
[00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:24.708]  Okay, it looks like, and maybe up in the balcony,
[00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:26.187]  Maybe a third?
[00:02:26.607 --> 00:02:32.349]  So does that mean the rest of you, the two-thirds of the people here, aren't even aware of KSEO and KOY?
[00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.829]  Because you've heard Alex on the internet?
[00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:35.689]  So a hand please.
[00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.810]  Internet.
[00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.510]  I would say two to one.
[00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.430]  Two to one.
[00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:51.813]  So it's another thing, it's another wonderful thing that's happened here because Alex Jones, us having Alex Jones, and Alex Jones promoting KSEO and KOY on the internet, has helped us too!
[00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:53.674]  Talk about a symbiotic relationship!
[00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:06.179]  So, anyhow, I've got to tell you a little bit of the story here.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:25.934]  A year and a half ago, Bill O'Reilly... Two years ago, Bill O'Reilly gave notice that he was getting out of the talk radio business.
[00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:34.808]  And at KSEO, as soon as he announced that on Fox News Channel, oh my god, the phones were ringing.
[00:03:35.328 --> 00:03:41.132]  They were just ringing off the hook from every syndication company in the world, saying, what are you doing?
[00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.132]  He's replaced Bill O'Reilly on the radio station!
[00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:50.535]  And the people were instructed to say, we're going to do locally-originated programming.
[00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:52.496]  Because we want to serve our community.
[00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:55.598]  And you can hear the thuds of people falling.
[00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:57.779]  Because no one does locally-originated.
[00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.700]  Everything's canned in this world now!
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.901]  There's nothing original!
[00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:03.443]  So anyhow.
[00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.364]  And then Glenn went to work on me.
[00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:08.146]  And said, now I know this guy is syndicated.
[00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:13.396]  And I know you don't want to have any more syndicate, you want to replace it with local, but what are you going to do for local?
[00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:16.198]  And I said, I don't know, we'll figure something out.
[00:04:16.638 --> 00:04:25.424]  Well, in the meantime, while you're thinking about, you know, what to put on for the local program to replace Bill O'Reilly, why don't you do an experiment?
[00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:27.006]  An experiment?
[00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:27.366]  Experiment?
[00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:28.347]  Alex Jones!
[00:04:28.487 --> 00:04:29.467]  Oh, okay.
[00:04:30.408 --> 00:04:32.910]  So we put on Alex Jones for an experiment.
[00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:34.726]  For a week.
[00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:36.727]  Where's Evergreen?
[00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:38.168]  Evergreen, are you here somewhere?
[00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:38.849]  Are you in the back?
[00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:48.857]  Okay, uh, within two or three days of putting on Alex Jones, I was walking out of the radio station one day, and a stranger walked up to me and said, are you MZ?
[00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:49.697]  And I said, yeah.
[00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:54.541]  And he reaches out his hand to shake my hand, and there's a hundred dollar bill in it.
[00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:57.724]  And I said, wow, what's this?
[00:04:57.744 --> 00:04:58.865]  He says, it's a hundred dollar bill.
[00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:00.146]  Why, haven't you seen a hundred dollar bill before?
[00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:02.643]  I said, she said, that's for you.
[00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:04.084]  And I said, why?
[00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:05.846]  Because you're carrying Alex Jones.
[00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:07.908]  I said, but it's only an experiment.
[00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:11.311]  We don't know that this is going to be a permanent thing.
[00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.253]  We're just putting it out there to see how it goes.
[00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:16.596]  He says, doesn't matter that you put him on for even one hour.
[00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.158]  You've earned this money.
[00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.061]  Wow, that's pretty powerful stuff.
[00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:27.308]  So anyhow, here we are a year and a half later, and Alex is on both stations.
[00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:36.457]  We broadcast him live on our smaller station, KOMY AM 1340, weekday mornings from 9am to 12 noon.
[00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:38.839]  Opposite Rush Limbaugh, who is on the parking lot.
[00:05:42.728 --> 00:05:49.870]  We also put him on our bigger station several hours later from 7 or 8 o'clock to 10 p.m.
[00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.111]  depending upon whether we have another program that's under contract at 7 to 8.
[00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:56.412]  In any case, that is our story.
[00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:57.792]  I don't want to take up any time.
[00:05:57.832 --> 00:05:59.613]  You paid to come here.
[00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:03.754]  Some of you, gentlemen here, from where?
[00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:06.295]  Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:29.268]  Powerful stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:29.828 --> 00:06:36.450]  There's an old Buffalo Springfield song called, uh, There's Something Happening Here.
[00:06:37.651 --> 00:06:40.052]  What it is, ain't exactly clear.
[00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:46.553]  There's a man with a message over there through that door and that man is named Alex Jones!
[00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:26.129]  During the intermission, a while later, we're going to be recognizing some very important, wonderful people.
[00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:28.030]  In fact, there's Dr. Stan right there!
[00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.973]  You folks are awesome!
[00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:47.961]  All of you are awesome, and I'm honored and blown away that you came to hear me.
[00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:09.058]  I'm a little selfish, and I didn't really come here tonight to hear me talk, but I'm going to take your questions and comments, and it's awesome to see lovers of
[00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:27.743]  There has been somebody for 48 years, a medical doctor who knew about the eugenics plan, that when I came to town, I called him a few weeks ago and said, please come.
[00:08:27.763 --> 00:08:28.643]  He said, I don't know.
[00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:34.065]  And today I called him and I said, you're coming to speak for at least 15 minutes before I speak.
[00:08:34.745 --> 00:08:36.045]  And then he'll stay during the intermission.
[00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.726]  We're going to have some other speakers before I come back for part two.
[00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:40.627]  He's Dr. Stan Monteith.
[00:08:52.557 --> 00:09:09.330]  In the 50s when people demonized you and attacked you a hundred times more than they attacked me, because all this stuff's coming true now, this guy was an icon who stood up against them and he does four or five hours of radio every day warning the planet.
[00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:17.656]  And so I wanted, I know most of you know him, but I came to here, not just you and not just to give a speech, but to talk to Dr. Stan Monti.
[00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:31.806]  So I wanted to spend 15-20 minutes crystallizing the fact that he's seen this huge awakening in where society's going and for us to count the cost and decide which side of this equation we're on.
[00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:33.588]  Liberty or tyranny!
[00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:47.496]  Well, I'm not going to take very long because I think that Alex really is doing the most amazing job.
[00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:54.561]  You know, I've been at this for 48 years now, but I've never seen as much enthusiasm as I've seen in the last few years.
[00:09:55.276 --> 00:09:58.037]  And things are getting worse and worse.
[00:09:58.077 --> 00:10:01.058]  Now don't believe them when they tell you that things are going to get better.
[00:10:01.418 --> 00:10:03.219]  That the housing market is going to stabilize.
[00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:03.859]  No it's not.
[00:10:04.219 --> 00:10:09.400]  The housing market is going to continue to fall and more and more people are going to continue losing their homes.
[00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:11.781]  They tell you that the jobs are coming back.
[00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:13.962]  The jobs are not coming back.
[00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:16.883]  They've been sent overseas and they're going to stay there.
[00:10:17.843 --> 00:10:18.964]  Why are they going to stay there?
[00:10:19.645 --> 00:10:21.006]  Because there is a plan.
[00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:24.808]  Now, most people really don't know what the plan is, but it's called globalism.
[00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:39.339]  It's an organized effort to lower the living standards in the United States and raise the living standards throughout the world so we can have a one world government, a one world religion, and a one world ruler.
[00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:53.035]  Now, if you want to document this, it's all in something called the Earth Charter, written by Stephen Rockefeller, the nephew of David Rockefeller, by Mikhail Gorbachev, and by Marie Strong.
[00:10:53.755 --> 00:10:58.741]  And there in point 10A of the Earth Charter, they say, we're going to have equitable distribution of wealth
[00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:00.867]  Between nations.
[00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:03.570]  Now, how do you get equitable distribution of wealth?
[00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.472]  Between the United States and China.
[00:11:06.012 --> 00:11:13.060]  Why, you lower living standards in the United States, and you raise living standards in China, and in India, and all throughout the world.
[00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:20.709]  And this is really what's happening, but they cannot tell the American people, because most of you are so selfish, you don't want to give up your home.
[00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:22.810]  You don't want to give up your pension.
[00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:28.414]  You don't want to give up your Social Security and your Medicare benefits and all the wonderful things that we have in this country.
[00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:36.338]  But you must understand, ladies and gentlemen, the America we have known has ceased to exist and will never exist again during our lifetime.
[00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:40.401]  But the one thing we can hope is that we're going to be able to preserve an element of freedom.
[00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:44.143]  Now, how are they sending our jobs overseas?
[00:11:44.163 --> 00:11:46.445]  Well, it's a process known as
[00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.018]  Offshoring Manufacturing.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.525]  And what we do is, we take a manufacturer and we say, look...
[00:11:53.354 --> 00:11:57.457]  You're paying 35% corporate income tax in the United States.
[00:11:58.137 --> 00:12:01.019]  How you'd like to not have to pay any taxes at all?
[00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:11.185]  You move your factory over to China, you don't have to pay any corporate taxes, you can keep that money, you can invest it throughout the world, you can set up a new manufacturing in all sorts of country.
[00:12:11.785 --> 00:12:18.290]  How many of you here, if you were offered that opportunity to make hundreds of millions of dollars, wouldn't take the opportunity?
[00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.171]  And that's what our great corporations are doing.
[00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:22.912]  Furthermore, they get abundant labor.
[00:12:22.932 --> 00:12:24.452]  There's all sorts of labor over there.
[00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:25.152]  Cheap labor.
[00:12:25.772 --> 00:12:28.973]  They don't have to put up with the bureaucracy, the harassment they have here.
[00:12:29.413 --> 00:12:36.995]  They do not have to actually pay unemployment insurance, workmen's compensation insurance, FICA taxes.
[00:12:37.856 --> 00:12:39.696]  They're actually given loans.
[00:12:39.716 --> 00:12:41.317]  You can get a loan if you go over there.
[00:12:41.857 --> 00:12:46.358]  We're doing everything we can to encourage our corporations to move overseas.
[00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:48.344]  I don't know.
[00:13:03.664 --> 00:13:04.565]  Protectionist?
[00:13:04.845 --> 00:13:06.246]  Oh, you're a protectionist.
[00:13:06.726 --> 00:13:07.487]  Why don't you know?
[00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:12.111]  If we put up tariffs, why would we have all sorts of people out of work?
[00:13:12.831 --> 00:13:16.094]  If we put up tariffs, we'd have tremendous trade deficits.
[00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:18.575]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have people out of work.
[00:13:18.976 --> 00:13:20.737]  The real unemployment is not 9.6%.
[00:13:20.977 --> 00:13:21.358]  It's close to 20%.
[00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:36.386]  If you use the U6 unemployment figures, which are put out by Bureau of Labor Statistics, but never mentioned by the controlled medium, and then you take away the birth-death ratio, it comes up to over 20%.
[00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:41.827]  If you calculate unemployment today, as they did during the Great Depression, over 20%?
[00:13:42.868 --> 00:13:44.908]  How many times have you heard that from Us Limbaugh?
[00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:49.470]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand, number one, the press is controlled in America.
[00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.391]  It's controlled by five or six great corporations.
[00:13:53.674 --> 00:13:57.235]  90% of the press is controlled through interlocking directorates.
[00:13:57.716 --> 00:14:18.503]  And we're talking about Time Warner, Bertelsmann, which is a European corporation, Viacom, which runs CBS, Disney, which runs ABC, Fox, which runs the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, that's Rupert Murdoch, and then of course the sixth is Comcast, they just bought up General Electric, pardon me, just bought up NBC.
[00:14:19.303 --> 00:14:20.604]  Most people don't understand
[00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:31.119]  That literally all of the major news magazines and major newspapers and major networks are intertwined in what I call the Brotherhood of Darkness.
[00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:38.661]  Intertwining in the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and all these things that Alex talks about and he's talked to you many times about.
[00:14:39.441 --> 00:14:43.082]  But they have an organized program to destroy this country.
[00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:46.135]  Now, first of all, you offshore manufacturing.
[00:14:46.575 --> 00:14:47.736]  Eight million jobs are gone.
[00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:49.038]  They're not coming back again.
[00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:51.661]  They're outsourcing our jobs.
[00:14:51.761 --> 00:14:59.089]  And that means, of course, Obama recently gave $23 million to an educational facility over in India.
[00:14:59.588 --> 00:15:16.121]  To teach Indians how to speak better English, so that they can have our answering jobs over there, and we can move our answering services overseas, because they can do our architecture, they can do our engineering, they can read our CT scans, and CAT scans, and all those sorts of things, medical.
[00:15:16.141 --> 00:15:28.331]  I mean, in fact, there are between 25 and 42 billion jobs that can leave America and be done just as well overseas, according to Dr. Alan Binder, who's a professor of economics at Princeton.
[00:15:29.184 --> 00:15:32.947]  What they're talking about is impoverishing the American people.
[00:15:33.628 --> 00:15:39.172]  They're encouraging people to come in from other countries, well-trained people with H-1B visas who work for much less.
[00:15:39.753 --> 00:15:42.715]  They're refusing to enforce our immigration laws.
[00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:43.056]  Why?
[00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:45.258]  Because they want the illegal immigrants to come in.
[00:15:45.798 --> 00:15:48.320]  So then we'll work for less and drive down our wages.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.422]  Now, right now, people aren't hurting too badly.
[00:15:50.462 --> 00:15:52.844]  I mean, we've got unemployment insurance.
[00:15:53.277 --> 00:15:57.698]  It's been extended out to two years, you get 50% of what you were making before.
[00:15:58.498 --> 00:16:01.479]  But what happens when the federal government runs out of money?
[00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:04.039]  You can't keep borrowing money.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:15.122]  And eventually what happens, and of course we're going to see this within about 10 years, is that they'll be putting out certainly more for insurance on the national debt.
[00:16:16.016 --> 00:16:23.121]  And for Social Security and Medicare, then all the money that comes in, there won't be anything left over for unemployment insurance, there won't be anything left over for the military.
[00:16:23.662 --> 00:16:26.804]  All of these programs, these wonderful programs, are going to come to an end.
[00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:29.726]  And that's exactly what they want.
[00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:31.208]  Who are they?
[00:16:31.228 --> 00:16:32.769]  Well, they're the Trilateral Commission.
[00:16:33.369 --> 00:16:42.256]  All you need to do, of course, is go back and read what Gary Goldwater told us back in 1979 in his book, No Apologies, when he said, this group is international.
[00:16:42.896 --> 00:16:43.477]  They're gold.
[00:16:44.255 --> 00:16:50.860]  is to take over the financial and commercial interests of the world by first taking over the government of the United States.
[00:16:52.141 --> 00:16:52.901]  What have they done?
[00:16:53.362 --> 00:17:07.312]  Well, from 1977 to 2008, every president and or vice president of the United States came to the membership roles of the 87 members of the North American chapter of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:17:07.332 --> 00:17:08.673]  Do you think that happened by accident?
[00:17:09.423 --> 00:17:15.085]  Six of the eight presidents of the World Bank, who control the world finance, came from this little group.
[00:17:15.966 --> 00:17:20.387]  Eight of the ten world trade representatives, who determine our trade policies.
[00:17:20.987 --> 00:17:24.349]  Seven of the twelve secretaries of state and nine of the secretaries of defense.
[00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:25.709]  They control our government!
[00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.690]  And Russ Levin is never going to tell you.
[00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:31.191]  And Sean Hannity isn't going to tell you.
[00:17:31.912 --> 00:17:33.332]  And Glenn Beck isn't going to tell you.
[00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.133]  But Alex Jones will.
[00:17:44.592 --> 00:17:46.515]  Alex is on the radio locally here.
[00:17:47.256 --> 00:17:49.498]  Michael's worming has the courage to put him on.
[00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:51.400]  Alex is doing a great job.
[00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:52.462]  He's picking up.
[00:17:52.482 --> 00:17:53.483]  I mean, I'm not going to be around.
[00:17:53.563 --> 00:17:53.623]  I'm 81.
[00:17:53.703 --> 00:17:55.585]  I'm not going to be around that much longer.
[00:17:55.926 --> 00:18:00.111]  But it's great to know that we have people who are going to be able to stand up and tell the truth.
[00:18:00.852 --> 00:18:03.435]  So without further ado, my good friend, Alex Jones.
[00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:21.373]  We could have done it without you.
[00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:26.576]  Thank you, Dr. Stan!
[00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:35.882]  How do we find Dr. Stan on the radio?
[00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:37.263]  Radioliberty.com!
[00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:47.921]  Since my microphone won't fit in here, I'll do it this way.
[00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:59.551]  Well, first off, it is just buoying, absolutely empowering to be here with so many lovers of liberty.
[00:19:07.818 --> 00:19:09.660]  The globalists are scared right now.
[00:19:14.741 --> 00:19:21.505]  They have quietly, behind the scenes, built this system of dehumanization and enslavement.
[00:19:22.466 --> 00:19:33.193]  But because there were so many great people like Dr. Stan Monteith, going back almost 50 years ago, G. Edward Griffin, Anthony J. Hilder, and so many others,
[00:19:33.652 --> 00:20:01.554]  Because of them being made fun of, laughed at, ridiculed, but telling the truth about the plan for a tyrannical world government, so many seeds have been planted and so many other people of the last few generations have been awakened that we are literally catching the technocrats who are filled with hubris and on power trips with their pants down and we've got a good chance of defeating them!
[00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:18.832]  More and more every day I quote the French philosopher Victor Hugo, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:20:23.313 --> 00:20:33.917]  And the global recognition of the planetary corporate dictatorship has never been on more fire than it is now!
[00:20:41.536 --> 00:20:57.066]  It was just four months ago that Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of the top engineers and global planners of this feudal plantation, addressed the Council on Foreign Relations branch of Canada.
[00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:03.735]  And what did he tell them with his voice tremulating, his voice shaking?
[00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:19.371]  He said, for the first time in human history, the entire planet is politically awake and aware, I quote, staring the elite in the eyes!
[00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:41.922]  Puppet politicians like George Herbert Walker Bush and Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and Barack Obama, they come and go!
[00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:49.344]  But the puppet masters that pull their strings, they are there, and they are the enemy
[00:21:49.884 --> 00:21:51.506]  And we recognize them!
[00:21:51.886 --> 00:21:55.871]  And we know they're waging eugenics Nazi war against us!
[00:21:56.191 --> 00:22:01.797]  And the spirit of free humanity is rising to resist them!
[00:22:14.778 --> 00:22:27.546]  They have attempted to control our paradigm and keep us in this false system of left, right, Republican, Democrat, but their false paradigm is falling!
[00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:36.552]  And as that illusion falls, as that iron curtain of deception
[00:22:37.779 --> 00:22:48.471]  Burns away, we are staring eye to eye with the psychopathic controllers who have engineered every major war in the last 210 years!
[00:22:57.455 --> 00:23:00.681]  The Great Awakening is upon us!
[00:23:01.142 --> 00:23:10.338]  And every single one of you, as Mahatma Gandhi said, carries the seed of the universe within your heart!
[00:23:16.363 --> 00:23:30.015]  You are the leaders, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, who are now at this historic fork in the road, this crossroads, who will make the decision for the species, for the human race.
[00:23:30.556 --> 00:23:40.445]  It is up to you to stand up against their scientific tyranny, to break their code, to realize their system, and to defeat them!
[00:23:48.891 --> 00:24:00.516]  I want to speak about who we really are, who we are individually, free humanity, versus who they are, who the controllers are, and the differences between us.
[00:24:02.557 --> 00:24:17.763]  Madison Avenue in the last hundred years, in their own public writings, talk about how they try to teach us that we're inadequate, that we're ugly, that we're weak, that we're powerless, so they can fill us full of their lies in the name of supposedly fulfilling us.
[00:24:18.303 --> 00:24:25.227]  And they do that because the controllers are fundamentally scared of who you are individually.
[00:24:25.568 --> 00:24:33.733]  They are fundamentally scared of the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit to their dehumanization!
[00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:40.557]  The globalists are scared.
[00:24:41.497 --> 00:24:47.081]  They are scared because they have engaged in a very wicked decision.
[00:24:47.981 --> 00:24:54.102]  The Global Controllers are highly intelligent, but they have learned the secrets of humanity.
[00:24:54.122 --> 00:24:56.523]  They've learned the secrets of our species.
[00:24:56.563 --> 00:25:09.846]  They know the potential, and they've decided to hoard that information to themselves and to use it to dominate and control their fellow humans, committing not just a crime against us, but a crime against themselves.
[00:25:10.626 --> 00:25:20.175]  And that's why they seek to shudder your psyche, your mind, your intellect, your soul, everything that you're capable of, because they are afraid of you!
[00:25:20.475 --> 00:25:23.858]  They know your inherent power!
[00:25:30.575 --> 00:25:35.697]  I go back to 1900, 110 years ago.
[00:25:36.237 --> 00:25:44.360]  Max Planck, a German physicist, in his mind, envisioned equations that developed the atomic theory.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:53.524]  Envisioned in his mind, on a blackboard, long before cell phones, long before jet aircraft, before airplanes had even taken to the air.
[00:25:54.344 --> 00:26:01.548]  He envisioned equations in his mind that developed nuclear reactors, atomic and hydrogen weapons.
[00:26:01.988 --> 00:26:06.050]  He deliberately wrote out the plans for these systems.
[00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.492]  That's what the establishment is afraid of!
[00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:16.455]  We have minds and souls that can literally break the secrets of the universe!
[00:26:16.735 --> 00:26:23.659]  We are made in the image of the creator of the entire dimension that we live in and beyond!
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.042]  Humanity is at an embryonic phase.
[00:26:37.623 --> 00:26:39.684]  And the global engineers know that.
[00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:49.671]  And they seek to stunt humanity, to dumb down humanity, to retard humanity, so it can be easily managed for our extermination.
[00:26:49.952 --> 00:26:58.298]  So that the children and the progeny of the global engineers can take to the stars and take part in the destiny of this species.
[00:26:58.538 --> 00:27:02.781]  But they are not righteous enough, pure enough, good enough,
[00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:06.790]  by a trillion light years to take control of our destiny.
[00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:11.661]  They are greedy, envious scum that must be defeated!
[00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:30.000]  The elite, whether it's Europe, China, Latin America, it doesn't matter.
[00:27:30.521 --> 00:27:41.949]  The global rulers of this planet are predatory, predators who enjoy dehumanizing and murdering and enslaving us, and they tell us that they're the elite.
[00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:53.297]  They developed the plan of eugenics out of social Darwinism, and social Darwinism, saying they were doing the planet a favor in murdering and killing and dumbing down populations.
[00:27:53.877 --> 00:28:01.681]  They are the most avaristic, inbred psychopaths who have a sheer pleasure in destroying society.
[00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:12.847]  They claim, this is their great secret, that they are building this world government in the name of peace, to stop nuclear war, to stop genetic engineering out of control.
[00:28:13.227 --> 00:28:14.468]  But on every front,
[00:28:15.188 --> 00:28:25.858]  They are greedily, like the demons they are, pressing the lever forward, slamming their foot down on the accelerator, driving us straight towards extinction!
[00:28:26.198 --> 00:28:28.160]  They are lovers of death!
[00:28:33.285 --> 00:28:37.009]  And like a moth to flame, they can't keep away from it.
[00:28:38.157 --> 00:28:43.700]  Like a moth to flame, they build their Hadron Superconducting Super Collider.
[00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:48.683]  And they make jokes on television about, yeah, there's a chance we're going to make a black hole.
[00:28:49.063 --> 00:28:53.806]  There's a chance we're going to cause an explosion a trillion times greater than the biggest H-bomb.
[00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:59.650]  But we're going to do it, because we are the supposed God-men, they say.
[00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:18.298]  Meanwhile, they say that countries have to be invaded and millions have to be killed over 110-year-old technology of atomic weapons that they themselves handed out to the children of the world, just like in the old westerns where they throw the gun before the child.
[00:29:18.838 --> 00:29:27.942]  And say, pick it up, kid, after the bad guy's already shot his daddy, and the little kid picks up the gun and they shoot him down in the dust, in the dirt.
[00:29:28.322 --> 00:29:33.304]  They use the technologies that have been developed as a pretext to menace this planet.
[00:29:33.624 --> 00:29:38.205]  They use the technologies they've developed as an excuse to take over our society.
[00:29:38.486 --> 00:29:42.187]  But at the base of everything they say, it is a lie!
[00:29:42.687 --> 00:29:46.749]  They are obsessed with death and destruction!
[00:29:47.725 --> 00:29:58.276]  And the human individual has to realize that we have no future if these people are not exposed and then ultimately defeated!
[00:30:06.324 --> 00:30:09.367]  It is the ultimate greed, the ultimate avarice.
[00:30:10.128 --> 00:30:31.998]  That the controllers understand what this species and this planet truly represents, the embryonic phase of our species, and that they would seek, with chemicals and biologicals and radiologicals and television and media conditioning, to dumb people down and to turn us against each other so that they can more easily manage our society.
[00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:39.282]  They have committed fundamental crimes, not just against races or groups, but against the human
[00:30:39.702 --> 00:30:41.443]  Community itself.
[00:30:44.384 --> 00:30:56.629]  You look at all the different medical reports, all the mainline statistics, the male sperm count in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Anglo-American arm of this system, and sperm counts are down by over 85%.
[00:30:57.449 --> 00:31:02.871]  Infertility and cancers amongst women are over 2,000% on average increases.
[00:31:03.171 --> 00:31:05.092]  They are killing us in our homes.
[00:31:05.392 --> 00:31:06.973]  They are killing us in our cities.
[00:31:07.273 --> 00:31:10.855]  And our towns quietly, slowly, they are doing this.
[00:31:11.156 --> 00:31:14.658]  They have confused us and compartmentalized us to the point we don't realize it.
[00:31:15.118 --> 00:31:18.441]  Just search the term human DNA irrevocably damaged.
[00:31:18.661 --> 00:31:36.313]  They've already gone in with the mercury-filled shots and the sodium fluoride in the water and the GMO foods in all the major studies and have already damaged the genetic code of this species to an incredibly dangerous level in their lust and their hatred of the general public.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:43.290]  And the establishment themselves spends all their times only eating off organic farms, only drinking fluoridated water.
[00:31:43.851 --> 00:31:49.621]  They reportedly have all the cures to the binary weapons systems that they've released into our population.
[00:31:51.155 --> 00:32:04.149]  And it comes to that point of just realizing just how completely psychopathic and out of control these people are that you then realize that your individual life means absolutely nothing.
[00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.972]  I have no fear of being killed myself.
[00:32:07.173 --> 00:32:09.815]  I have no fear of being destroyed by the media.
[00:32:09.936 --> 00:32:10.897]  I have no fear
[00:32:11.497 --> 00:32:25.229]  of disease individually, but I have great fear of being killed and not being able to complete my mission of warning humanity of what's happening to our society and allowing these people to continue.
[00:32:25.349 --> 00:32:34.216]  But the good news is they can't kill a Dr. Stan Montief or an Alex Jones or someone else because the idea, as I said earlier, is bulletproof.
[00:32:34.757 --> 00:32:35.738]  No arming.
[00:32:38.686 --> 00:32:44.227]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come!
[00:32:47.793 --> 00:32:51.674]  We have seen the type of society delivered by the globalists.
[00:32:51.734 --> 00:32:55.315]  We have seen what NAFTA and GATT and globalism has done.
[00:32:55.636 --> 00:32:58.957]  We have seen the hundreds of millions of deaths in the third world.
[00:32:59.717 --> 00:33:07.599]  We know it's a fraud, and the planet, as Zbigniew Brzezinski warned his minions, is awakening to them.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.001]  Just last November, they had the Copenhagen-Denmark summit.
[00:33:13.527 --> 00:33:18.231]  And the media reported, don't worry, they're going to pass this Copenhagen Global Treaty.
[00:33:18.271 --> 00:33:33.524]  They're going to have the world population accept the carbon taxes on what humans exhale and plants live off of, carbon dioxide, because the third world has been promised all of this money and all of these taxes to lift their people up if they go along with it.
[00:33:34.384 --> 00:33:39.669]  Then the Danish released the text to the third world countries.
[00:33:43.405 --> 00:33:53.533]  And it's stated that the taxes were a hair short of double on the third world what they would be on the West.
[00:33:54.093 --> 00:34:06.623]  It has been estimated to be a death sentence of at least 1 billion people within a decade if that program of soft kill eugenics is implemented and we must resist it!
[00:34:11.277 --> 00:34:19.043]  Remember, the globalists have created part goat, part spider creatures for more than 15 years to create body armor.
[00:34:19.523 --> 00:34:23.005]  They have created salmon that are part insect and other fish.
[00:34:23.346 --> 00:34:27.909]  They've created goats and cows and pigs that are part human for transplants.
[00:34:28.209 --> 00:34:35.935]  They've created thousands of different pharmacological crops that produce live HIV in the corn, protegine, a decade ago.
[00:34:36.355 --> 00:34:38.677]  They have engaged in unbelievable
[00:34:39.517 --> 00:34:43.819]  Genetic mutilation, genetic vandalism against this planet.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:49.082]  They have used depleted uranium by the tens of thousands of tons all over the world.
[00:34:49.282 --> 00:34:53.885]  That's a death sentence to the military that uses it and the populations they fire it on.
[00:34:54.545 --> 00:35:18.998]  They have engaged in unbelievable environmental degradation and the only reason they've gotten away with it is because they sit up there and pose as the environmental leaders telling you, don't worry about DU, don't worry about toxic waste, don't worry about cutting down trees, worry about carbon dioxide that's part of the carbon cycle of this planet.
[00:35:19.178 --> 00:35:21.039]  Can you see how sick that is?
[00:35:25.737 --> 00:35:29.020]  And so that's why I talk more and more about the true threats to humanity.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:38.768]  Hydrogen weapons, atomic weapons, antimatter weapons, cyclotrons, superconducting super colliders, open-air genetic engineering.
[00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:42.572]  This is the true threat.
[00:35:44.633 --> 00:35:45.374]  It came out.
[00:35:46.355 --> 00:35:47.636]  It came out a year ago.
[00:35:48.957 --> 00:35:51.439]  And we told you beforehand that the flu shot was deadly.
[00:35:51.779 --> 00:35:53.001]  That it was genetically engineered.
[00:35:53.837 --> 00:36:01.281]  And it came out that, oh, the big five drug makers had released an H1N1 simulant into the population.
[00:36:01.962 --> 00:36:10.246]  And now we know that simulant carries genetic RNA of viruses to literally reprogram our DNA.
[00:36:10.927 --> 00:36:17.451]  It's not just the toxic waste, the mercury, the asbestos, the rest of it, that is savaging and destroying human DNA.
[00:36:18.271 --> 00:36:30.439]  But it is the very viruses that they are loading our bodies full of as a weapon to dumb us down and to make us more servile and to make us sick so we're more easily controlled.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.883]  And to answer that question, I will be getting into their master plan, but you know what their master plan is.
[00:36:36.343 --> 00:36:37.004]  It is death.
[00:36:37.524 --> 00:36:38.445]  It is destruction.
[00:36:38.885 --> 00:36:43.328]  It is complete and total war against free humanity.
[00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:46.210]  The globalists in their own writings
[00:36:47.802 --> 00:36:51.524]  Over and over again, we covered this in my film, Endgame, with their quotes and where they said it.
[00:36:52.465 --> 00:36:55.807]  They talk about irrevocably changing the human spirit.
[00:36:56.467 --> 00:36:59.589]  And they describe themselves as gods, but they're not gods.
[00:36:59.629 --> 00:37:01.711]  They're just humans on a power trip.
[00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:05.553]  And they talk about how they are changing our species.
[00:37:06.033 --> 00:37:09.475]  They talk about how they are changing who we are.
[00:37:09.756 --> 00:37:13.278]  And if they were changing us for the better,
[00:37:15.103 --> 00:37:17.408]  That would still be wrong because they didn't ask us.
[00:37:17.909 --> 00:37:21.356]  And they are the ones making the decision whether they're changing us for the better.
[00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:29.372]  They admittedly are changing us for the worst.
[00:37:29.732 --> 00:37:37.154]  When they get on CBS News and say, Mercury, the feds have shown, actually helps children and their learning not hurts them.
[00:37:37.914 --> 00:37:41.655]  It makes, it cognitively enhances us.
[00:37:42.035 --> 00:37:43.276]  That's their sick joke.
[00:37:43.656 --> 00:37:50.978]  For them, lowering our IQ, dumbing us down, is a cognitive enhancement.
[00:37:52.247 --> 00:38:02.011]  For them, lowering our IQ is an enhancement because it's enhanced for them to make us more servile and more easily controlled.
[00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:07.273]  So the big issue at the end of the day is realizing evil.
[00:38:08.033 --> 00:38:09.494]  Realizing it exists.
[00:38:10.034 --> 00:38:11.534]  Learning how to recognize it.
[00:38:11.895 --> 00:38:17.917]  You know, we're taught that Mao and Stalin and Hitler and Pol Pot are evil and they certainly were.
[00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:23.312]  But we're taught to recognize evil as something from the past, black and white films.
[00:38:23.692 --> 00:38:29.914]  We don't see a creeping, slow death in control of our society at every level.
[00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:35.076]  And it's scary to realize this, but it's also empowering to know it.
[00:38:35.716 --> 00:38:42.778]  Because the greatest solution is knowing your enemy, as Sung Soo said, and understanding what they're doing.
[00:38:43.178 --> 00:38:46.300]  And knowing that they don't have your best intentions at heart.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:53.723]  In fact, they want you dead so they can have the future for themselves and their children and their grandchildren.
[00:38:54.044 --> 00:38:58.386]  And once you know that, you understand that it doesn't matter whether they kill you individually.
[00:38:58.706 --> 00:39:00.507]  It doesn't matter if your neighbor laughs at you.
[00:39:00.767 --> 00:39:02.908]  It doesn't matter what your boss or employees say.
[00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:04.409]  Because you have the truth.
[00:39:04.769 --> 00:39:06.030]  You have their own documents.
[00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:07.550]  You have their own reports.
[00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.812]  And you know who they are and fundamentally
[00:39:11.172 --> 00:39:15.614]  You understand that all of us individually will pass away.
[00:39:16.234 --> 00:39:19.675]  It's just like waiting for Christmas when you're a little kid and pretty soon it comes.
[00:39:19.995 --> 00:39:22.496]  But once you're an adult, it's there all of a sudden.
[00:39:22.736 --> 00:39:24.097]  The years just speed by.
[00:39:24.937 --> 00:39:27.898]  All of us are going to die sooner rather than later.
[00:39:28.138 --> 00:39:31.520]  But we live on through free humanity.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:39.883]  And once you commit yourself to this species, once you love your fellow man and woman, once you understand these greater truths, once you understand
[00:39:40.683 --> 00:39:56.568]  The level that we're playing against and how high the stakes are, it doesn't matter any more what they do to you individually because they cannot stop an idea whose time has come!
[00:39:57.068 --> 00:39:58.028]  Nothing will stop it!
[00:40:05.131 --> 00:40:09.656]  The globalists have spun this incredible web of technological control.
[00:40:10.497 --> 00:40:11.658]  They have beguiled us.
[00:40:11.738 --> 00:40:15.562]  They have seduced us into using their iPhones and their computers.
[00:40:16.002 --> 00:40:22.869]  They are engineering a society where we are all 100% dependent on it, on a system created by DARPA.
[00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.111]  Think about that.
[00:40:42.012 --> 00:40:46.393]  And more and more we now see them removing the freedoms that were once on the Internet.
[00:40:46.413 --> 00:40:51.555]  We see them more and more talking about curtailing free speech because they've misjudged.
[00:40:51.915 --> 00:40:56.036]  They plan to use the World Wide Web as a World Wide Wiretap.
[00:40:56.356 --> 00:41:04.458]  But now they understand that we, the individuals, have seized that system and are using it effectively against the globalists.
[00:41:14.124 --> 00:41:18.946]  How many of you saw the 1010 Project TV commercial?
[00:41:22.988 --> 00:41:32.072]  How many of you saw TV ads run in England to school children, put in front of movies in England?
[00:41:32.112 --> 00:41:33.313]  They tried to air them in the US.
[00:41:34.366 --> 00:41:43.951]  How many of you saw a teacher sitting there as this authority figure in front of her students saying, who's going to make a cut in their carbon footprint?
[00:41:44.512 --> 00:41:45.512]  Oh, Jenny, you are.
[00:41:45.592 --> 00:41:46.413]  Bobby, you are.
[00:41:46.493 --> 00:41:47.233]  David, you are.
[00:41:48.294 --> 00:41:49.094]  Karen, you are.
[00:41:49.495 --> 00:41:55.258]  Oh, you five kids aren't going to make a carbon cut, which is just a tax on the globalists.
[00:41:56.806 --> 00:41:57.146]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:57.166 --> 00:41:58.547]  She said, she said, there's no pressure.
[00:41:58.968 --> 00:42:00.229]  She said, you've made your decision.
[00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:05.073]  And then she hits a button and they explode and blood splatters all over the other children.
[00:42:06.854 --> 00:42:09.316]  And then they had another commercial in the same ad.
[00:42:09.716 --> 00:42:15.841]  It continued where it shows a corporate manager and he's standing up above them on the second floor and all the employees are down there below.
[00:42:16.121 --> 00:42:17.162]  And he's the authority figure.
[00:42:17.823 --> 00:42:23.227]  And he says, um, how many of you are going to make cuts in your carbon footprint?
[00:42:24.486 --> 00:42:29.867]  And most of them say they are, and he goes, that's good, it's your decision, but some don't, and he hits a red button and murders people.
[00:42:30.527 --> 00:42:37.609]  And then it shows a radio talk show host who won't make carbon cuts, and a soccer team that won't make carbon cuts, and they have to be killed as well.
[00:42:38.269 --> 00:42:44.531]  And now the phony environmentalists, the people that don't care about genetic engineering or nuclear weapons, they come out
[00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:48.933]  And they say more and more, yes, we are eco-fascist.
[00:42:48.973 --> 00:42:51.195]  We want to bring tyranny to save the earth.
[00:42:51.275 --> 00:42:52.235]  They're our saviors.
[00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:55.377]  We have to bow down before them.
[00:42:55.858 --> 00:43:03.682]  We have to go along with their agenda to artificially cut off our resources in the name of the environment.
[00:43:03.722 --> 00:43:04.663]  But my point is,
[00:43:05.987 --> 00:43:16.134]  If you go to Australia and you read ABC News in Australia, they teach children in the public schools, headline, children taught when to die, that when you're age 14 you should commit suicide.
[00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.216]  And then we wonder why there's record suicides.
[00:43:19.516 --> 00:43:22.678]  But don't worry, they've got serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:43:23.479 --> 00:43:26.902]  That admittedly, on the insert, increased suicide.
[00:43:27.222 --> 00:43:34.968]  To treat your suicidal tendencies when you're taught as a 5th and 6th and 7th grader how to commit suicide.
[00:43:35.368 --> 00:43:37.110]  This is all out in the open.
[00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:41.193]  And what they're doing is, they're turning off our survival instinct.
[00:43:41.673 --> 00:43:45.116]  They're teaching us that it's a good thing to want to die.
[00:43:45.416 --> 00:43:49.880]  They're teaching us that we're a pile of crap that needs to go away.
[00:43:50.558 --> 00:44:01.784]  They're telling us that we have no worth and that we need to get out of the way for the whales and the giraffes and the elephants and the Bengal tigers.
[00:44:02.244 --> 00:44:04.666]  But that isn't even the truth of the matter.
[00:44:05.106 --> 00:44:07.187]  They want us out of the way for them.
[00:44:07.767 --> 00:44:16.512]  Because the globalists have suppressed incredible life extension technologies and other systems and they don't want to give you access to it.
[00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:19.294]  And so we are literally frozen in a
[00:44:20.128 --> 00:44:31.010]  If you went back a hundred years ago and told somebody we'd have cell phones or that we'd have jet airplanes or that we would have genetic engineering, they would laugh at you.
[00:44:48.857 --> 00:44:50.198]  And it's the same thing today.
[00:44:50.638 --> 00:44:59.765]  What we know of, what we understand, is only a small part of what the controllers have now gained access to.
[00:45:00.086 --> 00:45:02.027]  And that's why they're so full of arrogance.
[00:45:02.428 --> 00:45:04.809]  That's why they're so full of hubris.
[00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:08.712]  Because they have all this technology.
[00:45:09.013 --> 00:45:10.594]  They're on amazing power trips.
[00:45:11.613 --> 00:45:14.215]  But there's one big problem with the equation.
[00:45:14.455 --> 00:45:20.940]  They're not giving and loving people that realize they're part of this species and connected to everyone else.
[00:45:21.521 --> 00:45:27.966]  Even if they lie to themselves and tell themselves that they're gods, they are still connected to each and every one of us.
[00:45:28.386 --> 00:45:35.812]  And when they commit that crime against humanity and our species, they commit a crime against themselves.
[00:45:44.841 --> 00:45:45.642]  Here's an example.
[00:45:46.342 --> 00:45:49.504]  Whether you look at China or Europe, anywhere in the world, it's the same thing.
[00:45:49.824 --> 00:45:58.630]  The more cunning, the more backstabbing, the more manipulative you are, the more duplicitous, your family accelerates into circles of greater and greater power.
[00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:12.639]  Until you have all these inbred psychopaths, intermarrying together, who don't just go along with killing their fellow humans and dumbing their fellow humans down, and who hate their fellow humans having an understanding of knowledge.
[00:46:12.919 --> 00:46:14.421]  I mean, I love people having knowledge.
[00:46:14.461 --> 00:46:16.283]  I love people taking their blinders off.
[00:46:16.363 --> 00:46:19.326]  I love people opening their minds to a larger and greater world.
[00:46:19.786 --> 00:46:21.027]  The globalists hate that.
[00:46:21.528 --> 00:46:24.271]  And that's a fundamental crime against creativity.
[00:46:24.771 --> 00:46:27.214]  And it's a fundamental crime not just against us, but themselves.
[00:46:28.115 --> 00:46:30.277]  But here's the message to the controllers.
[00:46:31.598 --> 00:46:35.682]  Do they think that once they're done, if they're successful,
[00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:42.913]  soft killing us slowly exterminating us through wars and famine and genetic Armageddon.
[00:46:43.674 --> 00:46:47.221]  Do they think that that psychopathic
[00:46:48.857 --> 00:46:52.300]  Murdering instinct that they have is going to go away?
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:47:02.508]  Do they think this war against their fellow humans is going to end when there's only 50 million globalists on the planet, as they put in the stone of the Georgia Guidestones?
[00:47:02.868 --> 00:47:08.713]  As the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 states, their plan is to reduce us
[00:47:09.946 --> 00:47:12.630]  By close to 90%, down to 500 million.
[00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:14.993]  Do they think they're going to stop the killing?
[00:47:15.474 --> 00:47:16.475]  Stop the murdering?
[00:47:16.876 --> 00:47:17.977]  Stop the poisoning?
[00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:19.540]  Stop the subterfuge?
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:19.980]  No!
[00:47:20.902 --> 00:47:24.286]  When you really study these people, it's like a giant Grand Prix.
[00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:32.495]  With a thousand globalist race cars out there on the track, all racing for who could be the most wicked, the most evil, the most destructive.
[00:47:32.935 --> 00:47:34.696]  Do they think that race is going to stop?
[00:47:34.956 --> 00:47:35.196]  No!
[00:47:35.677 --> 00:47:40.340]  They all hate each other more than they even hate us individually.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:47.584]  They only join together through their power structure as an attempt to cement their monopoly of power.
[00:47:48.224 --> 00:47:49.785]  They are not going to stop.
[00:47:50.246 --> 00:47:53.228]  The global elite are self-serving.
[00:47:54.048 --> 00:47:57.250]  When you read the main line, publicly available,
[00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:21.121]  Declassified history that in the 1850s, Galton, along with Darwin, developed the plan of eugenics.
[00:48:21.901 --> 00:48:35.864]  When you read deeper and find out eugenics isn't just injecting Guatemalan children with syphilis to kill them dead in a hammer, or giving Nigerian children live polio, now declassified, just going on this year.
[00:48:38.185 --> 00:48:38.445]  Oh no!
[00:48:39.491 --> 00:48:41.392]  It doesn't just stop with that.
[00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:46.173]  It continues on and on and on.
[00:48:47.233 --> 00:48:50.714]  And these people have committed these crimes out in the open.
[00:48:50.814 --> 00:48:52.555]  And they have trained us to be powerless.
[00:48:52.995 --> 00:48:56.536]  And trained us to accept all of this.
[00:48:56.676 --> 00:48:58.457]  And they are not gods.
[00:48:59.057 --> 00:49:00.817]  They are not all powerful.
[00:49:00.977 --> 00:49:03.198]  They have the amazing human potential.
[00:49:04.175 --> 00:49:06.396]  But they are the lesser among us.
[00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:15.162]  The average good-hearted person would never think like this, would never come up with ideas like this, would never do things like this.
[00:49:15.823 --> 00:49:17.924]  It is only the worst in our society.
[00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:31.773]  Going back to the social Darwinist who said, if we can kill masses of people, if we can start wars, if we can remove populations, we're doing a genetic favor to the planet because only the strongest exist.
[00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:54.135]  I know at a certain level it is, again, scary.
[00:49:55.156 --> 00:50:01.461]  But as Patrick Henry said, I would know the whole of the truth and make preparation for it.
[00:50:09.355 --> 00:50:19.244]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:50:27.571 --> 00:50:33.576]  And when you make the fundamental decision to face the facts and realize just how high the costs are,
[00:50:34.568 --> 00:50:37.029]  You understand what he was talking about.
[00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:38.990]  It is a spiritual death.
[00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:49.714]  It is a physical death to turn yourself over to their delusions, to turn yourself over to their mind control, and to go along with their fundamental lies.
[00:50:50.254 --> 00:51:02.339]  You are only alive and empowered when you are truly seeking the truth and opening yourself up to the overriding spirit of life and liberty that governs this universe.
[00:51:10.737 --> 00:51:15.405]  So as dire our straits are, remember what Martin Luther King said.
[00:51:17.168 --> 00:51:21.055]  The universe bends towards justice.
[00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:30.843]  And as Thomas Jefferson said, all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:51:31.323 --> 00:51:35.283]  Remember, the globalists know how much power you have individually.
[00:51:35.343 --> 00:51:36.844]  They know what you can do.
[00:51:36.964 --> 00:51:42.545]  They know what your ancestors went through, how they struggled for us to have anything today.
[00:51:42.885 --> 00:51:47.106]  They understand how strong our species is and they are scared of you.
[00:51:47.466 --> 00:51:49.166]  So from the time you're born,
[00:51:49.546 --> 00:51:51.288]  They teach you that you're bad.
[00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:53.231]  They teach you that you're pathetic.
[00:51:53.471 --> 00:51:55.794]  They teach you that you don't have any power.
[00:51:56.034 --> 00:52:07.948]  Because in truth, you have unlimited power when you take action for humanity and do the right thing and have the will and the confidence to face the facts.
[00:52:22.003 --> 00:52:25.365]  Earlier I talked about the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider.
[00:52:25.946 --> 00:52:29.288]  They were going to build it up in North Texas by Dallas and Waxahachie.
[00:52:30.769 --> 00:52:37.874]  Over a thousand mile concentric ring that where they were going to accelerate particles and they, in their own words, they say they're looking for the God particle.
[00:52:38.735 --> 00:52:41.377]  They're looking for a way to open a dimensional gate.
[00:52:41.397 --> 00:52:42.338]  This is not my words.
[00:52:42.378 --> 00:52:44.579]  This is Reuters and Associated Press.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.221]  And now they've built it.
[00:52:48.027 --> 00:52:48.247]  It's
[00:53:06.615 --> 00:53:18.346]  There's a statistical chance we're going to create a black hole that will destroy the Earth in seconds.
[00:53:18.927 --> 00:53:24.472]  There's a statistical chance we're going to make a strangelet that destroys the planet.
[00:53:24.772 --> 00:53:29.797]  There's a statistical chance that we're going to create a fission fusion reaction that
[00:53:30.885 --> 00:53:42.334]  Damages the planet or even destroys it, but we're going to do it in the search for information, in the search for immortality, in the search for the secrets of the universe.
[00:53:43.055 --> 00:53:48.119]  And then they tell us that the danger is carbon dioxide.
[00:53:50.921 --> 00:53:52.082]  Hey, I'll make a deal with them.
[00:53:52.263 --> 00:53:58.788]  We'll put a tax on carbon dioxide as soon as they stop all the genetic engineering and all the colliding of uranium.
[00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:21.828]  If they can take equations from Max Planck and Albert Einstein, some of them over 110 years old, and blow up entire cities, can you imagine what 110 years later these people have got?
[00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:27.672]  But what power is it if they destroy the whole planet?
[00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:33.134]  I love my three children, my two daughters and my son.
[00:54:33.154 --> 00:54:35.758]  I love them a thousand times more than myself.
[00:54:35.999 --> 00:54:39.865]  I'd give my life up instantly for them, not thinking one second!
[00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.972]  But I ask you a question.
[00:54:46.795 --> 00:54:49.978]  What do we give up for the unborn generations?
[00:54:50.098 --> 00:55:02.569]  If you could hold your great-great-great grandson in your arms, or your great-great-great granddaughter in your arms, would you not love them, or any other child, just as much as you love your children today?
[00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:12.178]  I say to the globalists, just like a diver down 400 feet,
[00:55:14.226 --> 00:55:18.681]  Who is having an oxygen-starved hallucination of grandeur.
[00:55:19.773 --> 00:55:22.514]  You have a delusion up in your ivory towers.
[00:55:23.414 --> 00:55:25.595]  You have released Pandora's box.
[00:55:26.035 --> 00:55:28.877]  You are hurtling our species towards destruction.
[00:55:29.577 --> 00:55:31.057]  You are not God!
[00:55:31.437 --> 00:55:36.659]  You may have the spirit and the seed of the universe in you, but you cannot control it!
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:48.104]  And how dare you hurtle our society and our species towards certain destruction in your mad, competitive drive for total power!
[00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:00.951]  I'm only halfway through one page.
[00:56:06.975 --> 00:56:14.719]  You know, I don't know what it is, but I keep my studio about 65 degrees, and every time I get angry and focused, I start sweating.
[00:56:17.461 --> 00:56:18.562]  Red-blooded, baby!
[00:56:21.483 --> 00:56:25.926]  And I'm in here right now, and I tell you, I'm sweating like a big fat hog.
[00:56:28.766 --> 00:56:29.870]  Let me tell you something.
[00:56:30.211 --> 00:56:32.157]  I can feel your energy.
[00:56:43.206 --> 00:56:44.968]  I can feel the energy.
[00:56:59.179 --> 00:57:06.807]  Your great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandmother gave birth in the bottom of a sewage-filled, rat-filled cistern.
[00:57:07.267 --> 00:57:17.177]  You are here today because of the incredible sacrifices that our ancestors have made, and I want to recognize everything humanity did!
[00:57:24.642 --> 00:57:45.218]  I want to recognize everything that our ancestors went through fighting 2,000-pound cave bears and saber-toothed tigers and hyenas and the weather and the earthquakes and huddling in caves, doing everything we could with our babies to survive.
[00:57:45.479 --> 00:57:48.101]  And I'm telling you, we're going to beat the New World Order!
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:21.794]  And may our ancestors, not just on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter, but our ancestors a trillion light years away, remember what we did when they faced those challenges, when our ancestors lived a million years.
[00:58:22.134 --> 00:58:24.416]  Let them remember what we, as their
[00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:35.496]  Protogenic humans did to ensure that the lowest scum didn't chart our course, but loving, free humanity talked to the stars!
[00:58:49.664 --> 00:58:50.064]  It is
[00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:55.161]  Thank you.
[00:58:59.546 --> 00:59:12.499]  As our ancestors fought and died and starved to death and sacrificed for us to be here, as we lay in this eugenics bed of comfortable death, watching the TV, gorging ourselves with the poisons,
[00:59:13.666 --> 00:59:18.489]  Remember everything our ancestors did to bring us to this point.
[00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:24.053]  Remember the honor and the beauty and everything good that we can literally feel in our genetic code.
[00:59:24.553 --> 00:59:33.059]  Remember those instincts, those ancestral memories that will take us in, through, and beyond and defeat the globalists!
[00:59:43.081 --> 00:59:44.641]  I haven't even begun to get my speech.
[00:59:47.382 --> 00:59:53.523]  And hey, I want everybody to be able, because I know a lot of you stood in line, I want everybody to be able to have a 15-20 minute intermission.
[00:59:53.543 --> 00:59:55.224]  I'm going to come back and speak for two hours.
[00:59:55.604 --> 00:59:56.884]  I'm going to take 30 minutes of questions.
[00:59:57.264 --> 01:00:02.965]  But I want MZ, some of the great folks from KSCO and their other great station to come up here and speak 15-20 minutes.
[01:00:03.025 --> 01:00:10.787]  And then I'm going to come back and I'm going to break down their system of control and I'm going to reach out to all those compartmentalized people and I am going to get
[01:00:11.327 --> 01:00:11.887]  It is us!
[01:00:11.967 --> 01:00:12.908]  You know, there are great truths.
[01:00:12.928 --> 01:00:15.629]  There are great truths to this world and this universe.
[01:00:40.213 --> 01:00:46.537]  And the globalists have taken all the sacred symbols that are so dear to humanity and they've co-opted them for their own control.
[01:00:46.837 --> 01:00:49.739]  If you use the symbol of the sun, they say it's a cultic.
[01:00:50.059 --> 01:00:50.779]  It's not a cultic.
[01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:52.080]  The globalists have taken that symbol.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.401]  Today I pulled over.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.641]  On the side of the road were these big trees and there were all these little acorns that had beautiful designs on them.
[01:00:59.981 --> 01:01:00.741]  Genetic beauty.
[01:01:01.382 --> 01:01:03.122]  And I saw the symbol of the star.
[01:01:03.682 --> 01:01:04.762]  That's not an evil symbol.
[01:01:04.782 --> 01:01:08.423]  That's a symbol the globalists have taken as their emblem of war and empire.
[01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:12.344]  And we see all of this masterful handiwork.
[01:01:12.824 --> 01:01:15.104]  The evidence of the Creator is in the firmament.
[01:01:15.124 --> 01:01:15.945]  It's in the stars.
[01:01:16.285 --> 01:01:17.245]  It's in everything around us.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:29.783]  And when you tune into the fact of just how special this life is, just how beautiful it is, whether it's a sunny day or a rainy day, to look at that ocean buoys and empowers my heart and my very being.
[01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:35.404]  There's something so beautiful about an old woman or an old man and their dignity and their humanity.
[01:01:35.564 --> 01:01:37.925]  There's something so beautiful about the innocence of a child.
[01:01:38.265 --> 01:01:43.467]  There's something so good about life and just wholesomeness and everything we can do together.
[01:01:44.507 --> 01:01:45.167]  We have been
[01:01:46.024 --> 01:01:48.066]  We have been taught corruption.
[01:01:48.367 --> 01:01:49.889]  We have been taught to hate each other.
[01:01:50.189 --> 01:01:51.571]  We've been taught to be weak.
[01:01:51.871 --> 01:01:53.733]  We've been taught to live in this system.
[01:01:54.073 --> 01:01:55.795]  But there's something so much better.
[01:01:55.996 --> 01:02:00.881]  That doesn't mean we're going towards some utopia, or some heaven, or some Valhalla, here while we're alive.
[01:02:01.522 --> 01:02:11.805]  But the issue is, by realizing the good versus the bad, we can make that decision and move in the direction that we choose to put our soul in eternity for.
[01:02:12.165 --> 01:02:16.086]  We make that decision of literal energy.
[01:02:16.586 --> 01:02:18.447]  Which side of the fence are you on?
[01:02:18.887 --> 01:02:20.227]  I am on the side of life!
[01:02:22.888 --> 01:02:25.388]  I am on the side of liberty!
[01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:30.590]  I am on the side of exploration!
[01:02:32.759 --> 01:02:34.680]  I am on the side of discovery!
[01:02:37.062 --> 01:02:38.943]  I am on the side of courage!
[01:02:42.265 --> 01:02:44.787]  And I'm not worried about how this ends.
[01:02:45.447 --> 01:02:48.889]  Because this is all just one piece in a larger play.
[01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:50.490]  A larger passion play.
[01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:57.635]  What matters is, while you inhabit this body, this earth suit, that you make the right decision!
[01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:04.201]  The Creator is watching.
[01:03:05.462 --> 01:03:07.022]  All of our ancestors are watching.
[01:03:07.842 --> 01:03:10.503]  Everything good and decent is on our side.
[01:03:11.043 --> 01:03:15.205]  And the moment we realize that is the second that tyranny falls.
[01:03:22.787 --> 01:03:24.567]  The globalists are scared.
[01:03:25.207 --> 01:03:27.028]  They can feel your strength.
[01:03:28.008 --> 01:03:29.369]  They can feel your honor.
[01:03:30.919 --> 01:03:37.001]  They can feel down into the bones of the earth the unstoppable force that is this species.
[01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:46.585]  And to the control freaks that think they will destroy this species and have the future for themselves, we tell you, not without a fight!
[01:03:52.827 --> 01:03:54.668]  We've got some great speakers coming up.
[01:03:55.648 --> 01:03:57.929]  I'm going to take a break and wring out my shirt.
[01:03:58.629 --> 01:04:00.090]  We're going to be back in 20 minutes.
[01:04:13.277 --> 01:04:14.559]  For God's sakes, Alex.
[01:04:17.502 --> 01:04:19.304]  You don't have to hold anything back.
[01:04:21.511 --> 01:04:32.219]  Okay, I want to recognize... I was recognized and given kudos to for bringing Alex Jones to the broadcast radio waves here.
[01:04:32.659 --> 01:04:35.922]  I want to recognize someone who's done way more than that.
[01:04:36.422 --> 01:04:41.546]  Who's in this... I don't know where he is, but that's Ted Anderson, the owner of GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:42.046]  Where's Ted?
[01:04:42.387 --> 01:04:43.407]  Hey Ted, come on up.
[01:04:44.368 --> 01:04:45.309]  Come on up and say hello.
[01:04:48.993 --> 01:04:51.734]  So I brought Alex to two radio stations.
[01:04:52.194 --> 01:04:55.915]  Ted's brought Alex to 50 or 100 radio stations.
[01:04:56.075 --> 01:04:56.635]  Hey Ted.
[01:04:57.275 --> 01:05:00.276]  Hey, thanks for having me up here and I really appreciate everybody coming.
[01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:09.799]  And the love and the power of this room and the whole audience that supports Alex.
[01:05:11.147 --> 01:05:12.908]  My heart, my thanks, everything.
[01:05:13.389 --> 01:05:19.954]  You've done so much for us, and I just can't say enough for them.
[01:05:20.214 --> 01:05:21.615]  We had to put it together.
[01:05:21.635 --> 01:05:25.518]  If MZ hadn't stepped up to the plate, you wouldn't have this.
[01:05:26.499 --> 01:05:29.761]  Alex rarely puts on a speech at an occasion like this.
[01:05:30.282 --> 01:05:34.405]  You have him, due to MZ's efforts, getting everything put together.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:53.319]  And of course everybody at the network, the production staff, everyone who puts in their full-time effort to make Alex Jones available for you, his own production staff, Aaron Dykes up here doing
[01:06:00.239 --> 01:06:01.640]  It seems like it's always a battle.
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:15.305]  I know that we had our website taken down here just on Thursday, and my engineering staff was up 24 hours, almost 48 hours, putting that back together so people could see the production and hear the production of Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.586 --> 01:06:23.609]  So, it is, it's a battle, and it's great to have him here, and it's great to have all of you here as well.
[01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:26.150]  I'll turn the mic back over to Mike.
[01:06:29.022 --> 01:06:35.708]  Okay, I want to let you know that in the next room, the Bayview room, there's a whole bunch of good stuff for sale.
[01:06:36.088 --> 01:06:37.089]  You know, including T-shirts.
[01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:42.333]  Well, we don't have too many Alex Jones Storms the Grove event T-shirts.
[01:06:43.073 --> 01:06:47.297]  I mean, they almost sold out even before the show started.
[01:06:47.797 --> 01:06:49.078]  But I do think we have a few.
[01:06:49.098 --> 01:06:54.122]  If you want to leave your email address, if you're interested in getting them, I think they're $20, I think, or something like that.
[01:06:54.983 --> 01:06:55.683]  You were there!
[01:06:55.703 --> 01:07:03.508]  I was here at the Alex Jones Storms the Grove event in Santa Cruz, California at the Coconut Grove.
[01:07:03.688 --> 01:07:15.915]  So there's some t-shirts and if you run out, we will have some more tomorrow and if you send an email to mz at ksco.com in case it's sold out and you want to get one, we'll arrange for you to get one in the mail or something.
[01:07:16.856 --> 01:07:18.377]  Let's see, I think we'll...
[01:07:19.363 --> 01:07:26.485]  We could either just let you have a break, or we could put on some of the KSCO talent that we have here.
[01:07:26.505 --> 01:07:27.065]  What do you think?
[01:07:27.745 --> 01:07:28.645]  You want to do that?
[01:07:29.685 --> 01:07:30.866]  Who should we start with?
[01:07:32.266 --> 01:07:32.906]  Cory?
[01:07:33.907 --> 01:07:35.247]  Dr. Cory Gold!
[01:07:35.847 --> 01:07:36.347]  Yeah!
[01:07:36.547 --> 01:07:38.288]  Get up here, Dr. Cory Gold!
[01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:43.569]  It's not as if you're unaccustomed to public speaking.
[01:07:44.414 --> 01:07:46.955]  You know, I'm unaccustomed to public speaking.
[01:07:47.035 --> 01:07:49.375]  I'm on the radio a lot, but public speaking is different.
[01:07:49.735 --> 01:07:51.776]  This guy speaks in public a lot.
[01:07:51.816 --> 01:07:54.036]  Dr. Corey Goldman.
[01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:55.777]  Talk about whatever you want.
[01:07:57.557 --> 01:07:59.878]  We were just giving some tips to Alex a few minutes ago.
[01:07:59.938 --> 01:08:03.079]  We said, if you got over your shyness, you'd be pretty good.
[01:08:03.139 --> 01:08:07.780]  Just be a little bit more emotional, and show us your true heart, because you're a little reserved.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.321]  So he's gonna come back out, and he's gonna do a little bit more than that.
[01:08:14.436 --> 01:08:19.560]  It's fun to be on KSCO with the local talk show host in the afternoon because they play Alex Jones in the morning.
[01:08:20.041 --> 01:08:22.422]  And I'm the first guy locally that people can call.
[01:08:23.003 --> 01:08:26.125]  So he gets them riled up all morning and I'm the first local guy they call.
[01:08:26.566 --> 01:08:28.307]  And I get to listen to Alex every morning.
[01:08:28.827 --> 01:08:32.871]  And it's a lot of fun because I get to hear you guys all speak your minds.
[01:08:33.091 --> 01:08:40.016]  And I've got to tell you, and Alex will be the first one to tell you, that I've changed my point of view a whole lot since you've all called my show.
[01:08:40.997 --> 01:08:43.098]  And Glenn Fisher, wherever Glenn Fisher is.
[01:08:43.158 --> 01:08:43.659]  Where's Glenn?
[01:08:45.134 --> 01:08:49.076]  Glenn was nice enough to say I'm awake, so I guess that's a compliment in this room here today.
[01:08:49.096 --> 01:08:50.057]  I think Glenn is in the can.
[01:08:50.357 --> 01:08:50.817]  Glenn's in the can.
[01:08:51.417 --> 01:09:01.523]  So anyway, it's a lot of fun out here, and if you're listening, if you live in this community out here, and you've never listened to KSCO, and you've never listened to AM 1080, you've got to give it a chance.
[01:09:01.943 --> 01:09:14.330]  It is the most eclectic, crazy, oddball radio show station in the world, where it's George Norrie, Dr. Stan Monti, myself, Alex Jones, all coexist and have the most wonderful time.
[01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:18.172]  And not one single caller is ever, ever filtered out.
[01:09:18.452 --> 01:09:20.293]  And not one single caller is ever censored.
[01:09:20.733 --> 01:09:22.834]  Any idea is allowed to be here live.
[01:09:23.254 --> 01:09:26.395]  And I gotta tell you, we are the Alex Jones Station out here.
[01:09:26.415 --> 01:09:27.556]  We're proud of it.
[01:09:28.196 --> 01:09:29.837]  And I have a lot of fun with you.
[01:09:29.897 --> 01:09:31.338]  And I'm telling you, you're teaching me a lot.
[01:09:31.618 --> 01:09:34.879]  And my wife is threat, threat, is scared to death by me now.
[01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:38.021]  Because what's happened to you in the last two years since you've been on KSCO?
[01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:39.401]  You used to be a normal guy.
[01:09:39.421 --> 01:09:40.342]  And I said, no.
[01:09:40.962 --> 01:09:41.622]  That's all done.
[01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:42.042]  I'm done.
[01:09:42.363 --> 01:09:43.063]  I'm ruined now.
[01:09:43.103 --> 01:09:47.364]  I'm now an Alex Jones fan, so thanks for Alex Jones for ruining me.
[01:09:47.424 --> 01:09:50.005]  I used to have a good marriage, and now I'm just me.
[01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:50.946]  But I am awake!
[01:09:51.026 --> 01:09:51.706]  Thank you, Glenn.
[01:09:52.226 --> 01:09:55.608]  Thank you all, and thanks to MZ for bringing him out here.
[01:09:55.848 --> 01:09:56.828]  It was very courageous.
[01:09:56.848 --> 01:10:02.690]  We've got to tell you, Santa Cruz did not love these decisions to put Alex Jones on, to put me on, and other people on.
[01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:04.771]  We challenge what people think.
[01:10:05.411 --> 01:10:09.593]  We challenge that what you hear in the real world is the way it really is.
[01:10:10.513 --> 01:10:15.101]  We put on alternative points of view and we say, why do you believe what you believe?
[01:10:15.142 --> 01:10:18.047]  And usually the answer is because somebody told them that's the way it was.
[01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:20.371]  So I say, why don't you start listening to other people?
[01:10:21.568 --> 01:10:33.414]  And I think we're doing a service for this community because there's nobody else in this entire community who's challenging people to think outside the way traditional controlled media is asking them to think.
[01:10:34.075 --> 01:10:35.255]  So please call into the show.
[01:10:35.295 --> 01:10:41.919]  If you want this area to change and you want more people to become awake, call in the KSCO during the day.
[01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.660]  Let your voices be heard.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.842]  If all they hear are the other folks, they'll think that's the only way people think.
[01:10:48.542 --> 01:10:55.327]  And if you want them to know there's other ways for people to believe, and there's other voices to be heard, you have to be one of those voices.
[01:10:55.747 --> 01:11:01.672]  Alex yelled at 800 of us today, so now it's your turn next week to call KSEO and yell at the other ones.
[01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:03.053]  Because they're not awake yet.
[01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:04.254]  They don't know any of this stuff.
[01:11:04.454 --> 01:11:05.875]  They've never heard of Alex Jones.
[01:11:06.075 --> 01:11:07.296]  They don't know what Infowarriors is?
[01:11:07.376 --> 01:11:08.656]  I know you think everybody knows!
[01:11:09.097 --> 01:11:10.097]  Most people don't know.
[01:11:10.477 --> 01:11:15.480]  When I asked people on the radio station the first week he went on, I polled people for one full week.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.041]  What do you think of Alex Jones?
[01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:18.942]  And most people have never heard of him.
[01:11:19.302 --> 01:11:21.523]  So we're not doing our job very well yet.
[01:11:21.923 --> 01:11:35.152]  If you believe that Alex Jones' message is the right message, and if you believe that what he's saying needs to be heard, then you need to tell other people about it, and you need to call into KSCO and tell people that you agree with what he's saying.
[01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:41.736]  So he's not the crazy nuts, you know, sweating on stage here, but he's the one who has a lot of people also agree with him.
[01:11:45.194 --> 01:11:47.135]  Anyway, you came here to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:11:47.576 --> 01:11:48.416]  I think we've filled in.
[01:11:48.616 --> 01:11:51.938]  I think somebody needs to give him a voice, a mint there.
[01:11:52.999 --> 01:11:56.961]  Yeah, Alex Jones, I'm going to start calling him a ventriloquist.
[01:11:57.622 --> 01:12:00.304]  Because ventriloquists are good at throwing their voice.
[01:12:01.599 --> 01:12:05.441]  Alex threw his voice out into the audience.
[01:12:05.681 --> 01:12:07.241]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:12:07.461 --> 01:12:10.043]  I thought my daughter could yell for the longest period of time.
[01:12:10.063 --> 01:12:13.284]  She's 14 years old, and she can yell for a long period of time.
[01:12:13.504 --> 01:12:15.505]  But I think Alex Jones has totally clipped her.
[01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:17.586]  And that's hard to do.
[01:12:18.746 --> 01:12:19.787]  Thanks, Corey Gold.
[01:12:19.847 --> 01:12:24.448]  Weekday is 12 noon to 2pm on your favorite radio station.
[01:12:25.109 --> 01:12:27.770]  Or soon to be favorite radio station.
[01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:30.271]  Alright, Dr. Future's here.
[01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:34.817]  Dr. Future, come on up and say a few words.
[01:12:35.238 --> 01:12:37.659]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is here somewhere.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.462]  He was last sighted in the Bayview room.
[01:12:42.883 --> 01:12:49.127]  So I'd like Pharmacist Ben to come forward and say a few words here on the lectern.
[01:12:49.647 --> 01:12:50.408]  But in the meantime,
[01:12:53.106 --> 01:12:55.667]  The man himself, whose real name is Alan Lundell.
[01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:56.688]  Oh, am I?
[01:12:57.408 --> 01:12:58.889]  It's alright.
[01:12:59.069 --> 01:13:03.431]  Al Lundell, my good friend, and Mrs. Future's son, Lundell, are here.
[01:13:06.152 --> 01:13:12.275]  The Dr. Future program airs on KSCO Tuesdays from 2 to 4.
[01:13:13.416 --> 01:13:14.776]  So, here's Dr. Future.
[01:13:14.936 --> 01:13:16.857]  Hey gang!
[01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:25.146]  Listen, some of the things that Alex said really resonated with me too.
[01:13:25.866 --> 01:13:30.547]  Especially with regard to our ability to create a true renaissance today.
[01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:40.870]  I think our community is really leaders in being able to create our own fuel, create our own food, decentralized economy, being able to think for ourselves.
[01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.431]  We're really setting an example for the entire planet here.
[01:13:44.191 --> 01:13:46.292]  And it's a privilege to be part of this community.
[01:13:47.893 --> 01:13:54.717]  So what we do on the Dr. Future Show is we look at once the globalists and that whole thing is torn down...
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:56.460]  What do we do then?
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.320]  We're still alive.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:58.641]  We've got to build something.
[01:13:59.061 --> 01:14:05.062]  And that's where we build, that's where we have the pioneers, and why we have the people that can create new infrastructure.
[01:14:05.562 --> 01:14:06.902]  A lot of us are pioneers.
[01:14:07.362 --> 01:14:11.503]  Pioneers that have no new territory to explore.
[01:14:11.543 --> 01:14:15.024]  We're one of the first generations where we just can't go out in wagon trains.
[01:14:15.364 --> 01:14:15.884]  So what do we do?
[01:14:15.924 --> 01:14:23.526]  We create new infrastructure, new ways of thinking about economies, new government structures, new ways of using the net as part of that infrastructure.
[01:14:23.906 --> 01:14:24.466]  Things like that.
[01:14:25.106 --> 01:14:49.185]  So we started the World Tesla Society about two weeks ago with Tom Quinn, one of the other hosts on KSEO, and there we're harnessing the power of the group mind, of our community, for looking at ideas and developing ideas along the lines of energy and food and economics so that we can create the society we want to live in.
[01:14:50.182 --> 01:14:58.485]  So that's what we do on the Dr. Future Show on the WorldTeslaSociety.com, which we're looking forward to sharing with those of you interested in helping me create that.
[01:14:58.905 --> 01:14:59.225]  Thank you!
[01:15:29.999 --> 01:15:34.483]  Hey, I've blown my voice so many times, the only reason it's deep.
[01:15:34.683 --> 01:15:36.445]  My voice wasn't deep 15 years ago.
[01:15:37.246 --> 01:15:39.708]  It was a little bit, but I've blown it out a few times.
[01:15:41.016 --> 01:15:43.857]  Uh, but I'm going to sit here and wait for everybody to get back to their seats.
[01:15:44.317 --> 01:15:47.978]  It's just so great to be here with such a wonderful crowd of lovers of liberty.
[01:15:49.898 --> 01:15:50.478]  So wonderful.
[01:15:51.438 --> 01:15:53.099]  Hey buddy, yeah.
[01:15:53.139 --> 01:15:57.940]  Anyways, I'm going to give everybody time to get back, so take your time.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:06.382]  Yeah, I don't smile a lot on the... You're a sweetheart, ma'am.
[01:16:18.953 --> 01:16:19.933]  I know you, Rebecca.
[01:16:20.654 --> 01:16:21.994]  You're a fellow human.
[01:16:22.714 --> 01:16:24.935]  Hey, but this guy was asking what I think of town.
[01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:34.037]  You know, I love central... I love central... central California, northern California.
[01:16:35.806 --> 01:16:41.634]  And, uh, I just, I love Santa Cruz and I love the people.
[01:16:41.955 --> 01:16:47.122]  But anyways, I'm... We love you, Alex!
[01:16:47.182 --> 01:16:48.364]  We love you, Alex!
[01:16:48.384 --> 01:16:49.265]  We love you, Alex!
[01:16:50.467 --> 01:16:51.648]  Yeah, no, no, take your time.
[01:16:52.009 --> 01:16:52.550]  Take your time.
[01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:58.112]  The revolution's in our mind, my friend.
[01:16:58.152 --> 01:16:58.953]  It's already begun.
[01:16:59.634 --> 01:17:01.476]  That's why the enemy's trying to come in with all this tyranny.
[01:17:01.496 --> 01:17:02.898]  I'm going to talk about that next.
[01:17:03.298 --> 01:17:04.200]  Anyways, I'll be back in a second.
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.341]  I want to give everybody a chance to come back.
[01:17:05.361 --> 01:17:05.802]  Take your time.
[01:17:29.861 --> 01:17:31.862]  I would imagine the bathrooms are pretty busy, so.
[01:17:32.942 --> 01:17:34.382]  Give everybody some time to get back.
[01:17:38.923 --> 01:17:40.544]  I can't get enough of that disco ball.
[01:17:49.146 --> 01:17:50.526]  Now I'm not going to torture the listeners.
[01:17:50.546 --> 01:17:52.667]  Who wants me to sing a song?
[01:17:59.707 --> 01:18:01.569]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:18:03.651 --> 01:18:06.113]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:18:11.037 --> 01:18:13.119]  Around the office, we have the ads playing while I'm on air.
[01:18:13.199 --> 01:18:16.623]  Definitely, that's one of the most infective jingles ever.
[01:18:18.124 --> 01:18:24.129]  There's a place down Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:18:24.997 --> 01:18:27.118]  They sow pride in every stitch.
[01:18:27.779 --> 01:18:30.000]  Guaranteed you like the way they fit.
[01:18:31.181 --> 01:18:32.862]  God, I'm singing advertisement jingles.
[01:18:32.882 --> 01:18:33.583]  We better look out.
[01:18:36.564 --> 01:18:39.106]  We're here in this interplanetary fight against the globalists.
[01:18:39.166 --> 01:18:41.488]  Now, let me tell you about blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:49.293]  At least I'm not doing jokes like George W. Bush about no WMDs here.
[01:18:50.353 --> 01:18:52.435]  No, no WMDs there.
[01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:01.972]  But we took that C-SPAN footage and showed all the dead families and it had a big effect.
[01:19:02.733 --> 01:19:06.696]  Bush making jokes about Iraq and his lies about WMDs and all those dead bodies.
[01:19:08.759 --> 01:19:10.100]  And I notice Obama does it too.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.442]  They joke about the war crimes and the drone attacks.
[01:19:14.204 --> 01:19:14.704]  It's funny.
[01:19:15.385 --> 01:19:19.950]  And they love to sit there and laugh in front of everybody and get us to involve ourselves in their evil.
[01:19:20.816 --> 01:19:38.004]  And then when we watch Jack Bauer on Fox News or Fox TV, same thing, Fox Fiction, when we sit there and watch it and fantasize about him as the new hero, he's torturing the bad guy, he's getting the answers, he's torturing that person's kid to get the answers.
[01:19:38.365 --> 01:19:41.626]  Why, the new heroes in America, they're child torturers.
[01:19:42.066 --> 01:19:44.788]  I mean, that just shows how incredibly bold these people are.
[01:19:46.128 --> 01:19:47.209]  Folks, ready to get rolling?
[01:19:52.805 --> 01:19:56.408]  I did want to speak a little bit more about the awakening that's happening all over the planet.
[01:19:57.549 --> 01:20:00.551]  You know, the alternative media is becoming the mainstream media.
[01:20:00.571 --> 01:20:08.518]  It is unseating, according to every metric we've got, the establishment press on the fake left and the fake right all over the planet.
[01:20:09.359 --> 01:20:12.161]  And the biggest illustrations of that are the fact that
[01:20:13.496 --> 01:20:20.537]  They're trying to inoculate us psychologically so that as this stuff comes out, it isn't a shock.
[01:20:21.198 --> 01:20:28.859]  So now they go on CNN and the Associated Press and Fox and go, here's Colonel such-and-such with the Marines.
[01:20:29.319 --> 01:20:30.940]  Colonel, how are you fighting Al Qaeda?
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.520]  Well, we give fertilizer to the Afghans to grow opium.
[01:20:36.921 --> 01:20:40.882]  It's only at over 12 times previous production, but that's how we fight drugs.
[01:20:40.942 --> 01:20:41.782]  We grow them.
[01:20:44.181 --> 01:20:49.647]  So it's not just a CIA aircraft now crashing in Mexico with pure cocaine from the source.
[01:20:50.448 --> 01:20:52.109]  It's not just congressional hearings about it.
[01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:56.594]  Now they just come right out and say, yeah, we're growing the drugs.
[01:20:58.496 --> 01:21:03.361]  Just Friday, before I flew out here, I had Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer on.
[01:21:03.401 --> 01:21:06.665]  He ran Operation Stratus IV and Able Danger.
[01:21:08.084 --> 01:21:15.368]  And his white side, not black side or dark side of the military, was actually trying to kill all these Al Qaeda operatives before 9-11.
[01:21:15.749 --> 01:21:16.929]  And they were told, stand down.
[01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:22.913]  But I had him on, and I said, do you know about them admitting that our government helps grow the opium?
[01:21:22.933 --> 01:21:25.014]  And he said, yeah, I do know about that.
[01:21:26.135 --> 01:21:27.676]  And he just said, I don't know what to say.
[01:21:28.655 --> 01:21:29.716]  See, they don't know what to say.
[01:21:30.176 --> 01:21:40.445]  But the issue is, this isn't five years ago or ten years ago when they said, lunatics like Alex Jones say our government's shipping in the cocaine and heroin.
[01:21:41.205 --> 01:21:44.608]  The only people they rate are those that aren't paying their cut to them, the small cowboys.
[01:21:45.068 --> 01:21:55.417]  Now they go, hell yeah we grow opium, buy the Megaton and ship it in, but if you're not for shipping heroin into America, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:01.342]  I mean, think about it.
[01:22:01.562 --> 01:22:11.827]  We have checkmated them to the point that they've got to come right out on the news and say, well, if we didn't grow the opium, Al-Qaeda would.
[01:22:12.647 --> 01:22:16.269]  But Al-Qaeda, of course, is Al-C-I-A-D-A, one of their creations.
[01:22:17.169 --> 01:22:22.572]  And it's just like they have to admit, OK, Operation Northwoods is declassified, the U.S.
[01:22:22.612 --> 01:22:27.414]  government plan, the stage 9-11 style attacks and crash planes and bomb D.C.
[01:22:27.474 --> 01:22:28.135]  and shoot people.
[01:22:29.504 --> 01:22:32.668]  But that was then, this is now, we wouldn't do something like that.
[01:22:33.429 --> 01:22:38.997]  And yeah, we called people conspiracy theorists for 40 years, but guess what?
[01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.139]  We've declassified it.
[01:22:40.319 --> 01:22:43.003]  We did stage the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:50.062]  And it killed 58,000 Americans and over a million Vietnamese and maimed over a quarter million Americans.
[01:22:50.502 --> 01:22:57.625]  But that's okay, because if you're not for staging terror attacks to get us into a war, you're not a red-blooded American!
[01:22:57.965 --> 01:23:03.907]  So, we are now at that point where they can't deny anymore.
[01:23:05.468 --> 01:23:10.410]  So they're coming out and saying, yeah, there's trillions of dollars missing the Federal Reserve took.
[01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:17.374]  And the Pentagon's missing $4 trillion in the last decade, but let's change the subject to this Turbin guy.
[01:23:17.434 --> 01:23:18.255]  Isn't he scary?
[01:23:18.976 --> 01:23:30.105]  Because if you ask us where the $4 trillion is from the Pentagon, or the $28 trillion missing the banks took, we're not going to be able to keep you safe.
[01:23:30.645 --> 01:23:33.848]  What did Dick Cheney say back in 2004 on Meet the Press?
[01:23:33.868 --> 01:23:37.691]  They were saying, Mr. Vice President, there's reports of Al-Qaeda leadership.
[01:23:39.244 --> 01:23:51.663]  Meeting at the White House and other places and that you had foreknowledge and he said There will be a nuclear attack in the United States if you don't leave us alone about this and allow us to protect you
[01:23:53.585 --> 01:23:55.426]  Remember what came out last Wednesday?
[01:23:56.207 --> 01:24:05.732]  Somebody leaked it to Fox News and the Associated Press, and strangely enough, Fox ran with it, and the Pentagon said, this is terrible, we're going to hunt down who released this information.
[01:24:06.152 --> 01:24:07.073]  They admitted it was real.
[01:24:08.013 --> 01:24:14.977]  Anwar al-Awlaki, the CIA lackey, to quote Tarpeley.
[01:24:16.578 --> 01:24:20.260]  No, I mean, look, we already knew this six, seven years ago we wrote articles about it.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.341]  We've been all over Awlaki.
[01:24:22.895 --> 01:24:39.949]  And they say, the guy that ran the Christmas Day underwear bombing, the guy that ran the Fort Hood shooting, Major Hassan, the guy that was the number three in command of 9-11, the guy who was involved in the Times Square attack, yeah, it's true!
[01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:49.297]  Two months after he was the number three suspect on national news, in plain view of everyone,
[01:24:50.808 --> 01:24:52.850]  This is still incredible, but it shows how bad we're hurting them.
[01:24:53.691 --> 01:24:58.857]  He went to the Pentagon to meet with the Secretary of the Army in the top brass for a celebration.
[01:25:00.559 --> 01:25:03.062]  I mean, they had one hell of a celebration on 9-11, didn't they?
[01:25:04.468 --> 01:25:17.451]  Just like PNAC documents, Dick Cheney, September 20, 2000, said, minus a Pearl Harbor event with at least 3,000 deaths to be blamed on foreign countries, we're not going to be able to expand our empire.
[01:25:17.992 --> 01:25:20.172]  That's how stupid they think we are.
[01:25:20.392 --> 01:25:24.513]  Their hubris, their arrogance out in the open is what is going to bring them down.
[01:25:24.593 --> 01:25:26.654]  So Anwar al-Awlaki
[01:25:28.573 --> 01:25:45.219]  Months after he's one of the top 9-11 suspects, is at the Pentagon in a top-level meeting with the head brass, and it's admitted in plain view, and then he runs every single terror attack after that.
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:57.644]  And you've got terror attacks that are purely staged like 9-11, but you've got other ones in every case, 93, World Trade Center bombing, New York Times, CBS News, where
[01:25:58.396 --> 01:26:04.440]  They admit that Ahmad Salam was hired to cook a fake bomb for some Muslim extremist nutcases.
[01:26:05.821 --> 01:26:07.162]  And, you know, they got them on all sides.
[01:26:07.242 --> 01:26:14.706]  They got black extremists, white extremists, Christian extremists, Buddhist extremists even in that group, Hindu extremists, not many Buddhist extremists.
[01:26:15.207 --> 01:26:15.987]  But you know what I mean.
[01:26:16.487 --> 01:26:19.129]  The point is, they got them all, but they're very rare.
[01:26:19.169 --> 01:26:20.570]  It's like finding an Easter bunny.
[01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:25.013]  You know, your mama told you about it, but you don't believe it like Santa Claus.
[01:26:26.089 --> 01:26:34.132]  The point is, we're told to give up all of our rights, and in every case, in the case of 93, this is all on record.
[01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:36.353]  In fact, it got declassified, the actual audio.
[01:26:36.393 --> 01:26:44.435]  We have the articles back in 1993 in the New York Times and CBS, but last year when we were making Invisible Empire with Jason Bermas, they had released the actual audio tapes.
[01:26:45.036 --> 01:26:51.038]  And so they hired this Ahmad Salam guy and the FBI says, we're going to cook a fake bomb and set up this mosque with some extremists.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:52.600]  Think he can do that?
[01:26:52.901 --> 01:26:54.081]  He was a former CIA guy.
[01:26:54.101 --> 01:26:55.342]  He says, yeah, I'll set up some extremists.
[01:26:56.102 --> 01:27:02.466]  And so they send him in and they say, now we're going to build a real bomb because they need that in court to bust them.
[01:27:02.566 --> 01:27:03.166]  Are you good for that?
[01:27:03.186 --> 01:27:06.027]  And he said, well, not really as long as there's not a detonator.
[01:27:06.668 --> 01:27:10.530]  He said, I'll build a bomb, a real one, to get them in court because I want to stop these people.
[01:27:10.930 --> 01:27:12.291]  Because he'd been in Egypt fighting them.
[01:27:12.652 --> 01:27:15.374]  But he said, you've got to not have a real detonator.
[01:27:15.394 --> 01:27:18.977]  And they said, absolutely no real detonator, Mr. Ahmad Salam.
[01:27:19.197 --> 01:27:20.218]  We wouldn't want to do something like that.
[01:27:20.739 --> 01:27:23.441]  Then, five days before, they said, here's the detonator.
[01:27:24.282 --> 01:27:25.963]  And he was an Egyptian bomb expert.
[01:27:25.983 --> 01:27:27.565]  And he said, well, this is a real detonator.
[01:27:27.825 --> 01:27:29.306]  And they said, well, that's going to help in court.
[01:27:30.107 --> 01:27:33.510]  Then, three days before, he came to them and he said, I don't want to do this.
[01:27:34.771 --> 01:27:36.773]  And they said, look, we're going to let this bombing go ahead.
[01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:40.789]  This is all... and then he got paranoid.
[01:27:40.809 --> 01:27:41.509]  He went, whoa!
[01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:43.730]  They're going to frame me for this.
[01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:48.991]  So he went into the FBI and recorded more than 12 hours of them telling him, go ahead with it.
[01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:51.572]  And they were going to bomb the World Trade Center.
[01:27:52.592 --> 01:27:55.692]  Now, this is on record.
[01:27:56.413 --> 01:27:58.673]  The tapes are released.
[01:27:59.093 --> 01:28:05.214]  Just like Anwar al-Awlaki is at the Pentagon two months after with the head brass in a secret meeting.
[01:28:05.554 --> 01:28:06.475]  He's already on the news.
[01:28:06.515 --> 01:28:07.615]  He's the number three in Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:07.635 --> 01:28:08.295]  He's at the Pentagon.
[01:28:09.642 --> 01:28:14.464]  And if you look at everybody Anwar al-Awlaki ran, it's the same story.
[01:28:14.984 --> 01:28:18.065]  They go out and find people with low IQs, generally about 80.
[01:28:18.465 --> 01:28:19.745]  That's close to mentally retarded.
[01:28:19.785 --> 01:28:21.686]  I mean, literally.
[01:28:21.806 --> 01:28:22.426]  No, I mean literally.
[01:28:22.766 --> 01:28:28.928]  They go find people who've already been profiled by the welfare system, and they set them up, or they find mental cases like Hassan.
[01:28:29.549 --> 01:28:33.630]  And it came out on mainstream news that Major Hassan at Fort Hood last year,
[01:28:34.597 --> 01:28:42.341]  Major Assange, for two years, was sending emails to Anwar al-Awlaki talking about, I'm gonna bomb, I'm gonna shoot.
[01:28:43.241 --> 01:28:47.284]  And the government protected him and allowed him to do what he did.
[01:28:48.004 --> 01:28:49.645]  So, they're a real terrorist.
[01:28:50.373 --> 01:29:04.222]  But, nine times out of ten, it'd be like if I went down and spent two years with some schizophrenic poor homeless person here in Santa Cruz and put them in a house and gave them money and found that one day that they'd go out and shoot some people.
[01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:05.223]  Who's guilty?
[01:29:05.403 --> 01:29:08.565]  That homeless schizophrenic or the people that got them to do it?
[01:29:08.585 --> 01:29:11.167]  I'm asking you that question.
[01:29:12.908 --> 01:29:15.550]  That's an example of how these people operate.
[01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:18.412]  That's an example of what they do.
[01:29:19.028 --> 01:29:21.429]  That's an example of the operations they run.
[01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.431]  So it's out in the open they're shipping the drugs.
[01:29:24.811 --> 01:29:26.572]  It's out in the open they're staging the terror.
[01:29:27.733 --> 01:29:30.615]  It's out in the open that the banks are robbing us blind.
[01:29:32.636 --> 01:29:36.878]  Let's go back a year ago with another one of Anwar al-Awlaki's patsies.
[01:29:38.279 --> 01:29:42.541]  I get a call from one of my listeners, Mr. Haskell, Kurt Haskell and his wife, they're lawyers.
[01:29:44.042 --> 01:29:46.304]  Two days after the Christmas Day bombing.
[01:29:47.004 --> 01:29:47.584]  Two days after.
[01:29:48.185 --> 01:29:48.505]  Two days.
[01:29:49.798 --> 01:30:12.044]  And he says, Mr. Jones, uh, I was in Europe, uh, at the airport and I was there in Amsterdam and I saw them bring in Mataleb, the underwear bomber, and he was disheveled, he looked like he was out of sorts, drugged, and he had no passport, he had no visa.
[01:30:12.364 --> 01:30:13.244]  This is on record!
[01:30:15.268 --> 01:30:15.548]  After!
[01:30:16.108 --> 01:30:16.709]  Not at first.
[01:30:16.849 --> 01:30:18.209]  It wasn't on record at first.
[01:30:18.549 --> 01:30:21.091]  I get this call, I confirm Kurt Haskell's on the plane with his wife.
[01:30:21.611 --> 01:30:22.811]  Later, other witnesses come out.
[01:30:23.632 --> 01:30:27.453]  And they describe in Amsterdam, this guy gets bypassed the naked body scanners they already had.
[01:30:27.673 --> 01:30:28.854]  He gets through the scanners.
[01:30:29.054 --> 01:30:29.994]  He gets through the checkpoint.
[01:30:30.495 --> 01:30:32.595]  And he's at the gate and he has no passport, no nothing.
[01:30:32.615 --> 01:30:34.476]  And they're saying, we're not gonna let this guy on.
[01:30:34.736 --> 01:30:40.239]  And a sharp-dressed man came and flashed ID and said, you will let him on the plane.
[01:30:40.259 --> 01:30:43.060]  And he was so high authority that they let him on the plane.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.281]  And the rest is history.
[01:30:44.301 --> 01:30:45.682]  He had a firecracker in his pants.
[01:30:46.042 --> 01:30:47.563]  So now we've all got a naked body scan.
[01:30:47.643 --> 01:30:51.405]  Then the FBI goes to Kurt Haskell's office and tells him you didn't see that it didn't happen.
[01:30:51.425 --> 01:30:52.806]  There was a lot of other stuff went on in the plane.
[01:30:53.206 --> 01:30:55.027]  But it's a long story we've covered on the radio.
[01:30:56.568 --> 01:31:00.211]  And for two months they lied and said that Kurt Haskell wasn't telling the truth.
[01:31:00.731 --> 01:31:03.633]  Then more witnesses from the plane came forward and said they saw it.
[01:31:04.293 --> 01:31:06.795]  And the undersecretary for visas
[01:31:07.611 --> 01:31:14.617]  Number two position in the State Department, Kennedy, went public and said, yeah, an unnamed U.S.
[01:31:14.658 --> 01:31:17.520]  intelligence agency ordered us to help him get on the plane.
[01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:22.745]  You got Anwar al-Awlaki at the Pentagon after 9-11, the mastermind.
[01:31:23.005 --> 01:31:30.472]  You got him running the underwear bomber and you've got the State Department being ordered to get him on the plane.
[01:31:31.553 --> 01:31:32.614]  We have these people.
[01:31:33.277 --> 01:31:37.678]  And the issue is, why they're scared, is they can't cover this up anymore.
[01:31:38.479 --> 01:31:40.639]  They can't shut down all the alternative media.
[01:31:40.839 --> 01:31:42.540]  They can't shut you up.
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:46.401]  And they know that this is happening.
[01:31:46.661 --> 01:31:47.801]  They're aware of that.
[01:31:48.022 --> 01:31:48.702]  So what do they do?
[01:31:49.982 --> 01:31:55.744]  Four months ago, Spy Talk, weekly column, written by a former CIA agent, Washington Post,
[01:31:56.957 --> 01:32:03.319]  They have a five-page article where they say the CIA fakes Bin Laden videos, but it's patriotic.
[01:32:03.759 --> 01:32:06.901]  Those videos you saw were fake, but it's patriotic.
[01:32:08.001 --> 01:32:13.803]  They have news articles where, yes, the government ships the drugs in, but you don't want the criminals getting the drugs, do you?
[01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:24.207]  They come out, yeah, the Gulf of Tonkin was staged, yeah, we did this, yeah, we did that, in an attempt to take our power of disclosure away.
[01:32:24.507 --> 01:32:25.127]  But it doesn't work.
[01:32:25.996 --> 01:32:35.789]  See, before they could tell you, there's no world government, there's no CFR plan to bankrupt the world economy and call for a global currency that's backed up by carbon taxes.
[01:32:37.403 --> 01:32:40.466]  But Dr. Stan Monti, 48 years ago, didn't care if they laughed at him.
[01:32:40.967 --> 01:32:42.668]  I didn't care 15 years ago if they laughed at me.
[01:32:43.089 --> 01:32:45.171]  You didn't care if your neighbor last week laughed at you.
[01:32:45.391 --> 01:32:46.172]  We told the truth.
[01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:47.794]  We're here in the open.
[01:32:48.074 --> 01:32:52.558]  We're going to tell the truth, and it doesn't matter what you say or what you do, we're not going away.
[01:32:52.779 --> 01:32:56.783]  And you can kill me, you can kill this guy, or you can kill her, but you can't get us all.
[01:32:57.143 --> 01:33:00.707]  And we're not going to stop, and we're not going to shut up, and we're not going to go away.
[01:33:12.028 --> 01:33:16.351]  And that's why I say, in resistance is victory!
[01:33:22.135 --> 01:33:26.579]  If your cause is right, it doesn't mean we're 100% right, but we're going in the right direction.
[01:33:26.819 --> 01:33:39.188]  If you're looking for the truth, and you don't shut up, and you never quit, and you can't be shut down, and you don't care what people say to you, and you never go away, nothing on earth can stop you, and that's why they're scared of you.
[01:33:46.852 --> 01:33:52.455]  They're scared of you because you carry the light of truth and honor and everything that's good in your soul.
[01:33:52.475 --> 01:33:57.957]  And when you turn that loose, there's nothing on this planet that can stop you.
[01:33:59.558 --> 01:34:05.041]  Now, I go back to this.
[01:34:06.902 --> 01:34:11.484]  When you have no shame, when you're not afraid,
[01:34:12.216 --> 01:34:17.444]  When you don't care what people say about you, who are scared, want to keep their little comfort boxes.
[01:34:19.788 --> 01:34:26.237]  When you get outside of that, it is so enlightening, it is so empowering, it is so
[01:34:27.671 --> 01:34:28.312]  Fulfilling.
[01:34:29.232 --> 01:34:43.382]  And as this spirit of liberty spreads, as people discover their own innate personal power and their own tie-in to the overall human destiny and something much larger, there's no amount of propaganda.
[01:34:43.402 --> 01:34:45.303]  There's no amount of slick semantics.
[01:34:45.343 --> 01:34:47.204]  There's no amount of divide and conquer.
[01:34:47.484 --> 01:34:51.587]  There's no amount of left-right paradigm that can stop you.
[01:34:53.829 --> 01:34:55.110]  And that's my overall message.
[01:34:55.870 --> 01:35:02.874]  Look, I'm just some guy 17 years ago who woke up to corruption, and I had a thimble's worth of information compared to what I have now.
[01:35:03.194 --> 01:35:07.636]  If I'm still alive 10 years from now, I'll be blessed, but I'll have even more knowledge than I have now.
[01:35:08.316 --> 01:35:11.638]  It doesn't even matter that we all have all the answers.
[01:35:11.678 --> 01:35:12.238]  None of us do.
[01:35:12.478 --> 01:35:14.019]  Anybody that tells you they do is a liar.
[01:35:14.579 --> 01:35:21.163]  It's that we have common sense, we know things are going in the wrong direction, and we're simply saying no!
[01:35:22.481 --> 01:35:43.808]  I control my own destiny, I am not your slave, and I'm not going along with this agenda, because my gut, because my gut, because my instinct, everything I am, tells me we're going in the wrong direction.
[01:35:44.889 --> 01:35:51.151]  I remember being on the air 15 years ago, been away for about 17, but 15 years ago, Local Access TV in Austin, right before I got a local radio show,
[01:35:51.892 --> 01:35:52.212]  I don't know.
[01:36:05.017 --> 01:36:06.098]  People who made fun of me.
[01:36:06.118 --> 01:36:07.058]  People who laughed at me.
[01:36:07.098 --> 01:36:08.439]  People that make jokes.
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:10.861]  I didn't get hurt by that.
[01:36:11.081 --> 01:36:12.462]  I felt sorry for them.
[01:36:13.162 --> 01:36:15.544]  Because I knew I wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[01:36:16.064 --> 01:36:18.906]  I knew that my elevator didn't go all the way to the top.
[01:36:18.946 --> 01:36:19.627]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:21.488]  I knew that I didn't have all the answers.
[01:36:21.828 --> 01:36:24.530]  And I felt so sorry for them that
[01:36:25.069 --> 01:36:27.169]  They couldn't even see what was plain.
[01:36:27.670 --> 01:36:33.011]  What a moron like me could see, they couldn't inherently understand that truth.
[01:36:33.271 --> 01:36:36.692]  Because this isn't, at the end of the day, about intelligence.
[01:36:37.112 --> 01:36:38.252]  This is about guts.
[01:36:38.872 --> 01:36:40.533]  This is about intuition.
[01:36:40.993 --> 01:36:42.673]  This is about discernment.
[01:36:43.013 --> 01:36:46.334]  This is about being tuned in to the truth.
[01:36:46.994 --> 01:36:52.899]  And when you simply switch your channel to the truth, you don't need Alex Jones to tell you anything.
[01:36:53.399 --> 01:37:03.187]  I'm just getting people to tune over to the truth, to open their eyes up, to look around them, to ask themselves, is what's happening a good thing or is it a bad thing?
[01:37:03.407 --> 01:37:10.553]  And that's all I want people to do is to realize there's more going on around them than what Fox and CNN say.
[01:37:20.731 --> 01:37:21.411]  And that's the key.
[01:37:22.092 --> 01:37:44.224]  If you simply start questioning and you take little steps, the incredible effect, the power of just getting a neighbor to think for themselves, of just getting a neighbor to value liberty and freedom, maybe one-tenth that they value the World Series coming up with the Giants and the Rangers, to get them to
[01:37:46.058 --> 01:37:51.219]  To appreciate being involved in the real process that is the human experience.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:57.461]  To just get them to buy a simple... Can you hear me?
[01:37:58.461 --> 01:37:59.322]  People can't hear me?
[01:38:00.802 --> 01:38:03.243]  The problem is this microphone doesn't go on this right here.
[01:38:05.883 --> 01:38:08.664]  Well that's upsetting, people can't hear me.
[01:38:14.506 --> 01:38:15.246]  Can you hear me?
[01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:19.431]  What about folks up there in the top?
[01:38:22.552 --> 01:38:24.192]  Alright, I'll sit here and hold this microphone.
[01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:27.414]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:38:34.816 --> 01:38:36.677]  Well hell, I'm upset now.
[01:38:37.697 --> 01:38:39.038]  You guys in the balcony couldn't hear me?
[01:38:41.959 --> 01:38:43.139]  Oh, let me hear them.
[01:38:43.159 --> 01:38:44.940]  Don't worry, I'm not going to repeat it.
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:47.141]  Hey, can you guys hear me up there?
[01:38:49.292 --> 01:38:50.192]  Could you hear me earlier?
[01:38:50.212 --> 01:38:52.193]  Okay, good.
[01:38:56.294 --> 01:38:58.375]  Well, it doesn't fit in here.
[01:39:01.676 --> 01:39:02.436]  It won't fit in there.
[01:39:02.456 --> 01:39:03.537]  Hey, that's an idea.
[01:39:03.577 --> 01:39:04.577]  Duct tape that sucker.
[01:39:06.278 --> 01:39:08.238]  I just hate holding a microphone, so.
[01:39:16.877 --> 01:39:19.519]  The people that knock down those buildings aren't just going to hear me, brother.
[01:39:19.539 --> 01:39:23.542]  They're going to hear you.
[01:39:23.562 --> 01:39:29.446]  Because by this guy taking this and putting it on YouTube, or doing his own videos, he's going to reach millions of people.
[01:39:37.132 --> 01:39:38.593]  Alright, alright, alright.
[01:39:38.713 --> 01:39:39.174]  I'll continue.
[01:39:39.194 --> 01:39:40.455]  Let me hook up this other microphone here.
[01:39:40.995 --> 01:39:43.076]  I've got to do all this technical stuff or they'll get mad at me.
[01:39:43.097 --> 01:39:46.279]  I've got a whole bunch of microphones up here.
[01:39:47.421 --> 01:39:47.842]  No, no.
[01:39:48.763 --> 01:39:53.308]  Listen, I'll be honest with you before I continue with the speech, and then your questions.
[01:39:53.328 --> 01:39:54.609]  I was about to say your phone calls.
[01:39:56.852 --> 01:40:04.461]  Before I go any further, it is humbling to be here with you today, and it's humbling
[01:40:05.137 --> 01:40:09.220]  To just be able to interact with people and to have folks travel from all over to hear me.
[01:40:10.001 --> 01:40:12.503]  Because again, I just see myself as an average person.
[01:40:12.863 --> 01:40:16.827]  But in that averageness, I realize the overall power that all of us have together.
[01:40:17.147 --> 01:40:18.208]  And that's what's special.
[01:40:18.488 --> 01:40:22.691]  It's all of us here tonight saying no to the tyranny.
[01:40:23.152 --> 01:40:24.433]  We're not going to lay down.
[01:40:24.693 --> 01:40:29.197]  And we're going to go out and wake up everybody we can to this dehumanizing agenda.
[01:40:37.421 --> 01:40:40.943]  And I want to say something to all the great security people and police that are here.
[01:40:42.644 --> 01:40:44.525]  I felt like I was carrying the nuclear football.
[01:40:45.285 --> 01:40:48.047]  Or nuclear, as George W. Bush would say.
[01:40:49.467 --> 01:40:50.828]  From Kennebunkport, Maine.
[01:40:52.789 --> 01:40:56.071]  Seriously, I like pulled up and it was like they were rushing me in here.
[01:40:56.611 --> 01:40:58.792]  And I do appreciate them.
[01:40:59.273 --> 01:41:01.494]  And that speaks to compartmentalization.
[01:41:02.483 --> 01:41:08.971]  You know, I see the national media, and I see how they show all these police brutality videos.
[01:41:09.632 --> 01:41:13.296]  And if you just go back five years ago, I would get very, very upset by those.
[01:41:13.797 --> 01:41:16.020]  And those are wrong on a case-by-case basis.
[01:41:17.242 --> 01:41:26.504]  But then I began to read more of the declassified psychological warfare manuals and things out there and I began to understand that at a limited level I'd actually played into the globalist plan.
[01:41:27.004 --> 01:41:27.744]  And all of us do.
[01:41:27.804 --> 01:41:28.524]  None of us are perfect.
[01:41:28.884 --> 01:41:30.325]  The fact is we're moving in the right direction.
[01:41:30.345 --> 01:41:36.006]  A lot of people don't get politically involved because they want to have it perfectly developed before they say anything or do anything.
[01:41:36.286 --> 01:41:37.466]  The truth is we're not perfect.
[01:41:37.746 --> 01:41:40.167]  And it's in that imperfection that's the beauty of our species.
[01:41:41.897 --> 01:42:02.526]  Then I began to read the psychological warfare manuals, and I also read a lot of the training they gave the SS, Hitler's Gestapo, and they liked early on in 1933, once Hitler was in power, to have their police go out and do abusive things so that the public would then, at least segments of them, start to hate them.
[01:42:03.388 --> 01:42:07.833]  And then as the public began to start hating the police, that's what they wanted.
[01:42:07.873 --> 01:42:10.776]  They wanted the police to feel like they were in their own group.
[01:42:11.177 --> 01:42:13.119]  They were in their own separate organization.
[01:42:13.359 --> 01:42:15.402]  The Nazis called it the cement of blood.
[01:42:16.581 --> 01:42:17.782]  But they were Germans.
[01:42:18.282 --> 01:42:19.323]  They were people too.
[01:42:20.243 --> 01:42:25.726]  And the secret here is that police are compartmentalized just like everybody else.
[01:42:25.766 --> 01:42:27.247]  They're human beings as well.
[01:42:27.988 --> 01:42:38.974]  And over the years I've had police send me so many documents, the MIAC and Homeland Security reports and countless others, where the government is training to take on gun owners and libertarians and conservatives and anti-war activists.
[01:42:39.334 --> 01:42:40.675]  None of this has to do with Al-Qaeda.
[01:42:41.035 --> 01:42:43.077]  Over 90% of the training deals with the American people.
[01:42:44.077 --> 01:42:51.105]  And I began to understand the type of programming that the police and the military had gone under.
[01:42:51.826 --> 01:43:03.199]  And to simply reach out to them and show them the larger picture, just like I'm doing the public, you know, the general public, so that they can make a decision for themselves which side
[01:43:03.599 --> 01:43:03.920]  I think?
[01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:24.805]  And show them how they've been conditioned.
[01:43:25.185 --> 01:43:28.487]  And show them how the system has fostered crime and corruption.
[01:43:29.128 --> 01:43:38.534]  And to show them the choices they have, nine times out of ten, they will make the decision to join free humanity!
[01:43:45.259 --> 01:43:45.459]  Now,
[01:43:47.088 --> 01:43:58.936]  That said, and anybody can search this out of Maryland or even Los Angeles, for more than 15 years they try as hard as they can to not hire any police officers with 100 IQ or higher.
[01:44:00.217 --> 01:44:01.278]  Now why are they doing that?
[01:44:01.898 --> 01:44:04.440]  Because they don't want people that are going to question.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:06.381]  They don't want people that are going to see deception.
[01:44:06.701 --> 01:44:08.783]  They don't want people who are going to question corruption.
[01:44:10.014 --> 01:44:19.601]  But in that microcosm of the government on record, I talk to a lot of people, they're like, man, I got two degrees and I played rugby but I didn't get hired as a cop.
[01:44:19.621 --> 01:44:20.382]  Well, it's because you got 140 IQs, stupid.
[01:44:24.611 --> 01:44:29.455]  You think they want a warrior of that caliber with a big brain who actually wants to protect people?
[01:44:29.595 --> 01:44:33.457]  Because a real man, a real woman, doesn't want to be a bully.
[01:44:33.497 --> 01:44:34.338]  They want to help people.
[01:44:34.698 --> 01:44:40.502]  Somebody with real power is ashamed to exercise it against people that don't deserve it.
[01:44:42.744 --> 01:44:43.665]  And the system knows that.
[01:44:43.685 --> 01:44:47.167]  But listen, they're not just trying to hire police with under 100 IQs.
[01:44:48.985 --> 01:44:49.966]  They're not just trying to do that.
[01:44:50.486 --> 01:44:52.908]  That's why they put the sodium fluoride near water.
[01:44:53.208 --> 01:44:56.170]  That's reduced the IQ upwards of 20 points in the last 50 years.
[01:44:56.610 --> 01:44:57.611]  Oh yeah, the U.S.
[01:44:57.671 --> 01:44:59.052]  isn't lethargic for no reason.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:05.422]  They're not just adding mercury to the shots to brain damage our children by accident.
[01:45:05.502 --> 01:45:09.523]  They're not just trying to hire police that aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[01:45:09.823 --> 01:45:11.724]  They want us all to be dull.
[01:45:12.144 --> 01:45:14.125]  They want us all to be dumbed down.
[01:45:14.385 --> 01:45:16.306]  They want us all to be drugged.
[01:45:16.806 --> 01:45:22.008]  Because they understand the innate power that all of us have within us.
[01:45:22.428 --> 01:45:26.109]  And so we need to come together and have that
[01:45:26.579 --> 01:45:37.049]  Message of fraternity and brotherhood and sisterhood and lay out the choices because they train a lot of people, corporate bureaucrats, lawyers, police, you name it.
[01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:47.194]  Corporate hatchet men, corporate hatchet women, to feel like they're part of a special group, an elite group, you know, that knows better and is doing all of this.
[01:45:48.035 --> 01:45:54.358]  And at the end of the day, if you actually study the globalist program, you understand that 99.9% of us are in the same boat.
[01:45:58.129 --> 01:46:20.381]  It doesn't matter if you're black, it doesn't matter if you're white, it doesn't matter if you're Hispanic, it doesn't matter if you're Asian, Native American, it doesn't matter if you're a preacher, it doesn't matter if you're a cop, it doesn't matter if you're a school teacher, an auto mechanic, a guy that sells auto parts, it doesn't matter if you're a psychologist, it doesn't matter who you are, you are under attack and the globalists are trying to create
[01:46:21.161 --> 01:46:24.402]  The maps that your mind is supposedly going to follow.
[01:46:24.763 --> 01:46:32.386]  They're trying to control and restrict your reality so they can blind you from the wider world.
[01:46:32.446 --> 01:46:35.367]  They are trying to pull the wool over your eyes.
[01:46:35.607 --> 01:46:43.270]  They are trying to blind you from this world that isn't a matrix yet, but is designed to become one.
[01:46:43.690 --> 01:46:45.591]  And that gets in to the end game.
[01:46:46.764 --> 01:46:51.250]  I remember seeing a document from the 1970s declassified in February of 2000.
[01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:55.456]  This is a few years after the first Matrix movie had come out.
[01:46:55.937 --> 01:46:59.502]  And I remember being on an army server reading a public document
[01:47:03.891 --> 01:47:07.993]  And they said, in the future, it's our job to end all conflict.
[01:47:08.593 --> 01:47:10.514]  And how are we going to end all conflict?
[01:47:11.134 --> 01:47:18.817]  All humans will live in tanks, with wires hooked into their brains, and we will all be part of a large, basic hive mind.
[01:47:18.837 --> 01:47:21.338]  Sounds crazy, it's not me, it's the Army saying it.
[01:47:22.038 --> 01:47:24.599]  Federation of American Scientists actually released it, and the Army said,
[01:47:26.032 --> 01:47:29.235]  The Matrix is actually what they want to do.
[01:47:29.916 --> 01:47:33.719]  Now, that doesn't mean that that's real or could happen.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.060]  That's up for debate.
[01:47:35.701 --> 01:47:38.584]  The point is, these people are trying.
[01:47:39.304 --> 01:47:42.567]  And that's how we're already watching five, six hours of TV a day.
[01:47:43.268 --> 01:47:45.109]  We're already interfacing with computers.
[01:47:45.509 --> 01:47:47.669]  We're already being sucked into this system.
[01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:53.771]  I've seen studies showing the average vocabulary of a high school student has been reduced by more than 30%.
[01:47:53.831 --> 01:47:56.993]  They can't even communicate with each other.
[01:47:57.333 --> 01:47:58.853]  What did George Orwell talk about?
[01:47:58.893 --> 01:48:06.396]  He talked about Ingsoc, English Socialism, where they would reduce the language down to a point where you couldn't even communicate with somebody.
[01:48:06.596 --> 01:48:10.217]  You couldn't even use the words to actually be able to even talk to them.
[01:48:10.937 --> 01:48:12.298]  And that's what they're planning.
[01:48:12.959 --> 01:48:17.042]  You read Ray Kurzweil and all these top futurists, Nobel Prize winners.
[01:48:17.943 --> 01:48:25.469]  They openly talk about, we will have world government by 2025 and we will exterminate the majority of the population.
[01:48:26.089 --> 01:48:32.234]  You read what Bill Joy in the 1999 April issue of Wired Magazine, co-owner of Sun Microsystems, a multi-billionaire.
[01:48:32.715 --> 01:48:34.996]  He wrote an article saying, why the future doesn't need us.
[01:48:35.882 --> 01:48:36.502]  You can pull it up.
[01:48:37.123 --> 01:48:45.488]  And he said, I went to a consortium meeting of the 200 richest IT owners, and the main discussion at the meeting was not about new technology coming out.
[01:48:46.429 --> 01:48:51.032]  The biggest part of the meeting was deciding, do we give people sports and entertainment?
[01:48:52.012 --> 01:48:55.534]  And do we just give people something to do because of robotics and technology?
[01:48:55.555 --> 01:48:58.036]  The elite doesn't need us anymore for manual labor.
[01:48:58.636 --> 01:49:00.998]  Or do we kill everyone?
[01:49:01.979 --> 01:49:02.459]  And look,
[01:49:02.776 --> 01:49:04.917]  People can say, well that's negative, that's scary.
[01:49:05.237 --> 01:49:06.598]  Look, you don't choose your reality.
[01:49:06.638 --> 01:49:07.659]  Reality is what it is.
[01:49:08.139 --> 01:49:15.884]  You can take some guy and put him on PCP and put him up on a 50-story building and he thinks he's a skylark about to go flying across the city.
[01:49:16.184 --> 01:49:19.145]  He's going to fall off that building and splash on the bottom.
[01:49:19.646 --> 01:49:20.306]  He's going to die.
[01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.547]  Perception is not reality.
[01:49:23.268 --> 01:49:26.630]  Reality is we've been fed a false delusion.
[01:49:27.717 --> 01:49:27.937]  I think?
[01:49:45.879 --> 01:49:49.260]  Say, my vision is everyone with a microchip being tracked by the government.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.241]  My vision is computers controlling our everyday lives.
[01:49:52.801 --> 01:49:54.781]  My vision is cars driving themselves.
[01:49:55.261 --> 01:50:01.103]  My vision is everything you do being tracked, to the point of we can predict the future off of tracking your mass movements.
[01:50:02.083 --> 01:50:05.684]  And everything he said 11 years ago is now happening.
[01:50:05.964 --> 01:50:10.465]  I was in my hotel room last night and saw a Ford commercial for a car that parks itself.
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:16.143]  Just like children now don't know how to do reading, writing, and arithmetic on average.
[01:50:16.163 --> 01:50:22.107]  They don't know how to do a basic equation with pencil and paper because they needed a calculator to do it.
[01:50:22.668 --> 01:50:27.271]  All of those tools are good, but at the end of the day, they dehumanize us.
[01:50:27.732 --> 01:50:29.733]  We are being killed by the largesse.
[01:50:30.033 --> 01:50:31.674]  We're being killed by the decadence.
[01:50:31.935 --> 01:50:36.278]  We're being killed by how easy everything is, when in truth, our species
[01:50:37.375 --> 01:50:43.520]  was developed and went through a process of incredible challenge to be where we are today.
[01:50:44.441 --> 01:50:47.843]  So that's why I use the term soft kill weapon.
[01:50:48.704 --> 01:50:50.405]  We are psychically being killed.
[01:50:50.826 --> 01:50:52.307]  We are emotionally being killed.
[01:50:52.687 --> 01:50:54.368]  We are mentally being killed.
[01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:59.953]  At every level we are being anesthetized and drugged by entertainment
[01:51:00.799 --> 01:51:03.361]  I challenge any of you to read the top futurists.
[01:51:19.213 --> 01:51:20.694]  And these aren't just futurists.
[01:51:21.534 --> 01:51:25.637]  These are people who are designing many of the technologies that dominate our lives.
[01:51:25.977 --> 01:51:32.000]  And they have huge events with thousands of people that attend and keynote speakers like William Shatner.
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:38.124]  And they've all been offered, this is what they say at these meetings, this is all public, this is all open source.
[01:51:38.424 --> 01:51:40.365]  Just like I told you, Anwar al-Awlaki,
[01:51:41.377 --> 01:51:45.740]  The number three guy, now the number one guy they say in Al-Qaeda, openly works for the Pentagon?
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:47.401]  That's publicly admitted.
[01:51:48.042 --> 01:52:01.030]  And when I get up here and I tell you that the futurists, the transhumanists, Julian Huxley, head of the UN UNESCO program in the 50s said, we got kind of a bad name under Hitler with eugenics, we better change it to transhumanists.
[01:52:01.671 --> 01:52:04.333]  They have these meetings and this is all they talk about.
[01:52:05.302 --> 01:52:24.699]  And I talked to news reporters that have come and interviewed me for major magazines, and they go, yeah, we interview Harvard and Yale professors, and they say the same thing you're saying, but they say it's a good thing that all the public's a bunch of idiots, you know, they don't want to be cyborgs, we're going to be cyborgs, and we're going to blast off into the future, and everybody else is basically going to be removed.
[01:52:25.139 --> 01:52:29.103]  And I know this all sounds crazy, but so do cell phones, so do jet airplanes.
[01:52:29.483 --> 01:52:30.864]  So do rockets into space.
[01:52:31.364 --> 01:52:32.705]  So do all of this.
[01:52:32.765 --> 01:52:41.929]  We are living in a Buck Rogers age right now, and what we know is only a tiny layer of this overall system.
[01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:51.254]  So, the stakes are so high, and the people running the system are folks just like us, but they've been offered
[01:52:52.233 --> 01:52:55.914]  The entree of eternal life.
[01:52:56.314 --> 01:52:58.254]  And again, I'm not saying any of this is real.
[01:52:58.875 --> 01:53:00.635]  I'm not saying they can actually do this.
[01:53:01.395 --> 01:53:07.377]  The issue is 110% they are saying they're doing this.
[01:53:07.537 --> 01:53:21.420]  And so if you want to get inside the mind of a globalist, if you want to know what they're thinking, what they're saying, what they're really doing, what makes them tick, why they want to get rid of 6 billion people down to 500 million, they openly state it.
[01:53:22.608 --> 01:53:25.271]  They say we've got life extension coming online.
[01:53:26.072 --> 01:53:28.155]  And again, this is at the suppressed technological level.
[01:53:28.215 --> 01:53:28.936]  It's more advanced.
[01:53:30.137 --> 01:53:32.561]  And we're not going to give this to the general public.
[01:53:32.601 --> 01:53:33.562]  They are profane.
[01:53:34.283 --> 01:53:34.984]  They are weak.
[01:53:35.344 --> 01:53:36.065]  They are dumb.
[01:53:36.866 --> 01:53:38.588]  And they do not deserve this.
[01:53:39.702 --> 01:53:48.810]  And we need to set up a planetary dictatorship to carry out orderly one-child policies, forced abortions, Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:49.631]  It's all public.
[01:53:50.031 --> 01:53:52.754]  Vaccines, tetanus shots that sterilize you.
[01:53:52.934 --> 01:53:53.915]  This is all public.
[01:53:54.135 --> 01:53:56.577]  Just like Anwar al-Awlaki's admitted Pentagon terrorist.
[01:53:57.137 --> 01:54:01.161]  We've got all the Rockefeller Foundation documents directly linked on their own website.
[01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:04.083]  They're proud of how they made the tetanus shot.
[01:54:04.784 --> 01:54:06.806]  To sterilize you or reduce your fertility.
[01:54:07.146 --> 01:54:10.889]  They're proud of the Guatemalan children they shot up with syphilis.
[01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:13.791]  They're proud of the black people they shot up with syphilis.
[01:54:14.011 --> 01:54:19.555]  They're proud of the 4,000 plus American foster children they radiated to death.
[01:54:19.996 --> 01:54:20.536]  All public.
[01:54:21.297 --> 01:54:22.618]  But we trust this government?
[01:54:22.958 --> 01:54:24.259]  We go along with this government?
[01:54:25.159 --> 01:54:27.121]  They tell us we're taking your rights and your liberties?
[01:54:31.425 --> 01:54:36.509]  When it's in the news every day, oh, Project Shad, nerve gas, thousands of U.S.
[01:54:36.529 --> 01:54:38.370]  veterans, many of them died.
[01:54:38.991 --> 01:54:40.932]  But the government was doing it to keep us safe.
[01:54:41.653 --> 01:54:45.856]  Any of you that wear the uniform and serve this system, you do a lot of good work every day.
[01:54:46.316 --> 01:54:51.660]  But those above you, those that run the system, they know full well what they're doing.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:58.486]  I mean, I'm going to be the former head of the Putin Uranium Weapons Program, Dr. Doug Rockey, Dr. D.U.
[01:54:59.186 --> 01:54:59.647]  They knew.
[01:55:00.822 --> 01:55:02.743]  In the 70s, how deadly DU was.
[01:55:03.344 --> 01:55:04.405]  There are an army manuals.
[01:55:04.465 --> 01:55:06.546]  In the 90s said it was completely devastating.
[01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:08.007]  It would kill anybody that used it.
[01:55:08.027 --> 01:55:09.668]  It would take a few decades to kill them.
[01:55:10.489 --> 01:55:14.552]  But now they just serve it out to all troops and say, no health problems, don't worry about it.
[01:55:15.032 --> 01:55:20.196]  They are normalizing this program of extermination and control.
[01:55:20.616 --> 01:55:22.457]  They are doing this out in the open.
[01:55:22.698 --> 01:55:25.259]  They're admitting, yeah, we're shipping the drugs.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:26.740]  Yeah, we run the terrorists.
[01:55:27.201 --> 01:55:28.622]  Yeah, we staged terror attacks.
[01:55:29.102 --> 01:55:35.927]  Yeah, yeah, we're poisoning your food and water, and we're sorry, like Hillary Clinton said two weeks ago with the syphilis.
[01:55:36.628 --> 01:55:38.109]  We're, we're sorry.
[01:55:38.429 --> 01:55:40.851]  They're only sorry they got caught.
[01:55:47.235 --> 01:55:49.537]  So I'm gonna ask, I'm gonna ask you a question right now.
[01:55:50.938 --> 01:55:52.019]  Is it negative
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:56:02.625]  If I was to fall off this stage and get a compound fracture and break my leg, would it be positive, like all these
[01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:25.092]  Fake healer preachers say, just say, my legs heal.
[01:56:25.112 --> 01:56:28.234]  Or, would it be positive to actually go get my leg fixed?
[01:56:29.494 --> 01:56:30.155]  Okay?
[01:56:30.995 --> 01:56:33.797]  Knowing the problem is half the battle.
[01:56:34.838 --> 01:56:44.204]  You know, you see that Pentagon propaganda cartoon, but it actually takes an old Special Forces term from World War II, with the airborne, that knowing is half the battle.
[01:56:45.868 --> 01:56:52.094]  Look, I don't have all the answers, but I'm here to tell you what I've discovered, and you can check it all for yourself.
[01:56:52.674 --> 01:57:03.945]  And once you know that all is not well, once you know there's something rotten in the state of Denmark, the corruption is so limitless, I invite you to go discover it yourself.
[01:57:04.625 --> 01:57:09.209]  I invite you, if you've got the will and the courage, to go look at it for yourself.
[01:57:10.154 --> 01:57:16.498]  And then to decide what you are going to do about it because it is a bottomless pit of evil.
[01:57:17.018 --> 01:57:19.480]  I am almost afraid to continue researching.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:27.165]  I am almost afraid to continue looking into this information because I've done a test.
[01:57:27.805 --> 01:57:34.930]  I can sit there at my house at midnight in front of my computer and I can sickeningly envision the most evil thing I can imagine.
[01:57:35.717 --> 01:57:41.638]  And out of six and a half billion people in governments, I can search that term and find it worse than I even envisioned.
[01:57:43.279 --> 01:57:43.999]  You understand that?
[01:57:44.939 --> 01:58:00.142]  The most horrible things you can imagine these people are doing, and they've only been able to get away with it because good people, they want to help the old lady next door, who want to do good in business, who want to be fair, who enjoy being wholesome.
[01:58:05.745 --> 01:58:15.872]  It's time that good people realize just how bad some people are and get wise to it and take these people down.
[01:58:15.932 --> 01:58:16.892]  We can do it together!
[01:58:24.137 --> 01:58:30.181]  Now, I've only covered one page and I've got three more.
[01:58:31.081 --> 01:58:31.762]  Seriously, listen.
[01:58:33.570 --> 01:58:36.831]  I told them I was going to speak about two and a half hours and they said, oh, we're here for four hours.
[01:58:37.371 --> 01:58:49.193]  Do you guys want me to go to question and answer or do you want to go for another hour?
[01:58:49.233 --> 01:58:49.673]  Keep going?
[01:58:49.753 --> 01:58:51.334]  Alright.
[01:58:51.374 --> 01:58:55.014]  I think I hear about 790 keep going and about 10 go to questions.
[01:58:55.034 --> 01:58:57.495]  I'll tell you what, we'll make a compromise here.
[01:58:58.515 --> 01:59:02.136]  I will go for 30 more minutes and then I'll take about 30 minutes of questions.
[01:59:11.567 --> 01:59:13.088]  You've all got to ask yourself the question.
[01:59:13.108 --> 01:59:15.431]  A lot of you have done your own research.
[01:59:15.831 --> 01:59:17.472]  A lot of people listen to my show.
[01:59:17.953 --> 01:59:19.854]  They take my challenge to check stuff out.
[01:59:20.455 --> 01:59:21.436]  They think I'm a kook.
[01:59:21.916 --> 01:59:26.360]  Then they go to the research and they go, oh my goodness, this guy wasn't joking around.
[01:59:27.862 --> 01:59:29.023]  The costs are so high.
[01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:34.573]  That I just want to, before I get into this other information, I want to do what I've been doing all night.
[01:59:34.653 --> 01:59:40.837]  I want to challenge you again to realize just how special and important every single human life is.
[01:59:41.177 --> 01:59:44.459]  And just how beautiful and wonderful each individual is.
[01:59:44.719 --> 01:59:49.062]  From birth, we are set in front of televisions in our crack-filled diapers.
[01:59:51.103 --> 01:59:56.565]  To basically be dumbed down and to be put into a state of fear and to be taught how worthless we are.
[01:59:57.205 --> 02:00:00.126]  Why do you think the social engineers teach you you're worthless?
[02:00:00.546 --> 02:00:01.527]  Because they know the truth.
[02:00:03.047 --> 02:00:03.847]  They're scared of you.
[02:00:04.288 --> 02:00:07.949]  A lot of people think of themselves as this little, measly person who's powerless.
[02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:10.730]  But your soul, your intellect is powerful.
[02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:14.611]  And a good person, compared to evil,
[02:00:16.033 --> 02:00:25.642]  An evil person is like a chicken-necked, one-foot-tall, wart-covered goblin compared to a 10,000-foot bronze giant.
[02:00:26.783 --> 02:00:34.970]  And it's time for people to understand that and to really ask yourselves,
[02:00:36.641 --> 02:00:45.132]  In this limited short life we have, in this amazing blessing that is consciousness, are we going to be active participants in engaging corruption?
[02:00:45.432 --> 02:00:47.675]  And that's what's so wonderful when I do have events like this.
[02:00:48.157 --> 02:00:51.399]  To actually have a chance to interface with all of you.
[02:00:51.419 --> 02:00:52.700]  I mean, I can feel the energy.
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:53.840]  I can feel the love.
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:55.662]  I can feel the liberty.
[02:00:56.122 --> 02:01:02.606]  And I can sense and feel people who aren't cowards and who are not afraid to face the facts.
[02:01:02.686 --> 02:01:04.307]  People who don't lie to themselves.
[02:01:04.627 --> 02:01:06.168]  People who are not delusional.
[02:01:06.628 --> 02:01:13.752]  People who don't sit there like so much of the public and think they can make their own reality and buy into whatever snake oil they want.
[02:01:14.333 --> 02:01:16.014]  It is so good to be here with you tonight.
[02:01:25.954 --> 02:01:28.977]  Alright, I've got a bunch of notes here, and I'm just going to start going through these points.
[02:01:29.097 --> 02:01:35.262]  You know, I wrote this up at about 4 o'clock this afternoon, as I usually do when I give a speech, you know, points and issues I wanted to get into.
[02:01:36.143 --> 02:01:48.673]  One of the big ones is just basic control, how the globalists control us, and the process we're in right now from converting to a quasi-free society to the greatest surveillance police state society the world has ever seen.
[02:01:48.693 --> 02:01:54.478]  And the first big issue is they're training us that everyone is a criminal, except government.
[02:01:55.319 --> 02:01:58.566]  Everyone has no privacy except the government and corporations.
[02:01:59.508 --> 02:02:04.038]  No one has any dignity but the corporations and the system.
[02:02:04.439 --> 02:02:05.341]  And that's a lie.
[02:02:06.298 --> 02:02:10.020]  And, you know, things that were unthinkable ten years ago are now out in the open.
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:14.922]  We see these TV ads all over the country about kids, tattle on your parents, spy on them, it's the right thing to do.
[02:02:15.422 --> 02:02:18.824]  The Boy Scouts are training to take on disgruntled veterans, isn't it great?
[02:02:19.124 --> 02:02:24.847]  They had a drill with the Explorer Club, the UGAN, you know, took out ten veterans who wouldn't turn their guns in.
[02:02:24.907 --> 02:02:25.627]  New York Times.
[02:02:26.232 --> 02:02:28.995]  I mean, this type of stuff is right out there in the open.
[02:02:29.515 --> 02:02:36.582]  And they're taking the public, the police, everybody, and just slowly acclimating us to accept it.
[02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:40.786]  And, you know, I'll tell a story here in my notes.
[02:02:41.767 --> 02:02:46.992]  I flew in Friday night, and our plane was delayed, so I got here about 11 o'clock at night in San Francisco.
[02:02:48.712 --> 02:02:56.831]  And, well, first off, I was in Austin when we get there, and I go to the checkpoint, and a couple of TSA people are listening, and I say, hey, how you doing?
[02:02:58.052 --> 02:03:02.075]  And I talked to one of them and I say, you know, they're about to put naked body scanners in here.
[02:03:02.135 --> 02:03:06.418]  And the government had lied about that and said, oh, there's no radiation dangers.
[02:03:06.438 --> 02:03:07.358]  Now they admit there are.
[02:03:07.779 --> 02:03:09.400]  Oh, we don't save the naked images.
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:10.821]  Now they go, oh, we save them all.
[02:03:11.541 --> 02:03:12.722]  And it's going in your courthouse.
[02:03:12.802 --> 02:03:13.702]  Again, just lying.
[02:03:13.722 --> 02:03:17.645]  I mean, if your neighbor lied to you this much, why would you trust anything they said?
[02:03:17.945 --> 02:03:18.746]  But government doesn't.
[02:03:18.766 --> 02:03:19.266]  You trust them.
[02:03:19.686 --> 02:03:21.348]  So I went to the TSA people.
[02:03:22.148 --> 02:03:38.591]  Then our plane was delayed a couple hours, so I'm sitting there and I watch these TSA guys, three of them, go around to all the gates, the four or five gates where I was at, and I watched them just randomly pick out, gotta be an 85-year-old woman on a walker, that's Al Qaeda.
[02:03:39.791 --> 02:03:44.615]  Yeah, I'd swab her and do all this, and then I watched them search other people, and I watched them laughing.
[02:03:45.475 --> 02:03:48.557]  These TSA guys, you know, six, seven years ago, were taking it serious.
[02:03:49.138 --> 02:03:50.478]  They knew this was a complete joke.
[02:03:51.179 --> 02:03:51.739]  I mean, they knew.
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:56.382]  They knew that there weren't any terrorists, there wasn't anybody trying to blow up a plant in Austin, Texas.
[02:03:56.983 --> 02:03:58.004]  They knew this was a joke.
[02:03:58.064 --> 02:04:03.787]  And I actually went over and talked to some of them, and they didn't know who I was that great, but they were like, yeah, we're just doing our job.
[02:04:04.997 --> 02:04:10.359]  But the issue is, the fact is, five, six years ago, I got irritated by being searched.
[02:04:10.479 --> 02:04:11.260]  You know what's scary?
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:12.560]  Mr. Stinky Feet!
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:15.221]  Yeah, I'll tell Mr. Stinky Feet if you want.
[02:04:16.122 --> 02:04:17.222]  I'll tell you what's scary.
[02:04:18.563 --> 02:04:23.425]  Is that now, even Alex Jones is conscious of all their manipulation.
[02:04:23.565 --> 02:04:23.905]  No, I'm not.
[02:04:23.925 --> 02:04:24.765]  I'm just like everybody else.
[02:04:25.186 --> 02:04:26.526]  I'm powerful, but I'm also weak.
[02:04:27.106 --> 02:04:27.947]  Yeah, it's a mix of that.
[02:04:29.511 --> 02:04:31.994]  It's like walking the dog now.
[02:04:32.094 --> 02:04:39.961]  It's like getting the mail out of the mailbox to take my shoes off, to take my belt off, and submit to all of this.
[02:04:40.322 --> 02:04:42.043]  And that's what the system's doing.
[02:04:42.424 --> 02:04:47.669]  It's acclimating all of us to accept the equivalent of going into gas chambers.
[02:04:47.689 --> 02:04:48.830]  What do they do at the gas chambers?
[02:04:49.210 --> 02:04:51.893]  Or running people into pits in Russia or Germany before they kill them?
[02:04:52.133 --> 02:04:57.097]  Take your shoes off, take your stuff off, take your belt off, take your valuables off, go in here.
[02:04:57.778 --> 02:05:00.220]  And the TSA people, they have no clue.
[02:05:00.681 --> 02:05:04.564]  Have they done decades of research into psychological warfare conditioning operations?
[02:05:05.024 --> 02:05:06.766]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:08.307]  These men and women aren't bad.
[02:05:08.567 --> 02:05:10.149]  They're getting $15 an hour.
[02:05:10.529 --> 02:05:11.790]  It's just a job for them.
[02:05:12.231 --> 02:05:14.192]  They believe Al-Qaeda wants to kill us.
[02:05:14.453 --> 02:05:17.655]  They don't know it's Al-Cieda, though more and more ask for my autograph, so they do.
[02:05:18.826 --> 02:05:20.487]  Literally, it happens almost every time.
[02:05:20.767 --> 02:05:22.628]  I could be in Montana, LA, you name it.
[02:05:24.468 --> 02:05:29.410]  And here they are, and they're hurting people through these systems.
[02:05:29.690 --> 02:05:34.672]  You're taking your shoes off, you're taking your belt off, you're answering questions, and it's always more, more, more.
[02:05:34.772 --> 02:05:36.333]  Oh, there was a shoe bomber, gotta take your shoes off.
[02:05:36.673 --> 02:05:38.794]  Oh, there was an underwear bomber, we gotta naked body scan you.
[02:05:39.154 --> 02:05:40.515]  Oh, we gotta ask you these questions.
[02:05:41.582 --> 02:05:50.590]  And I remember already seeing what they were doing nine years ago, but then about two years later, what I'd already thought, seeing total confirmation.
[02:05:51.271 --> 02:05:52.632]  Because these criminals love to brag.
[02:05:53.232 --> 02:05:55.795]  I was watching Governor Ridge, the head of Homeland Security.
[02:05:57.328 --> 02:05:58.369]  And he was on C-SPAN.
[02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:02.092]  And he said, we're going to have checkpoints at malls.
[02:06:02.672 --> 02:06:03.853]  We're going to have them on the highways.
[02:06:04.514 --> 02:06:07.196]  We're going to have them to get to go into work.
[02:06:07.776 --> 02:06:09.918]  He said, we're going to search everybody.
[02:06:09.938 --> 02:06:12.980]  And you're going to have to have a national ID card to have a job.
[02:06:13.361 --> 02:06:17.464]  And America is going to be like one big, giant airport.
[02:06:17.524 --> 02:06:18.885]  This is in 2003.
[02:06:19.385 --> 02:06:22.488]  And he said, we're going to have TSA checkpoints on the streets of America.
[02:06:26.103 --> 02:06:27.304]  They're in Dallas, Texas.
[02:06:27.324 --> 02:06:28.164]  They're in Boston.
[02:06:28.185 --> 02:06:29.145]  They're in Los Angeles.
[02:06:29.785 --> 02:06:34.008]  And they are running people through the scanners and naked body scanners.
[02:06:34.468 --> 02:06:42.633]  And when you think about these TSA workers, I've had radiologists on the radio show to go over what is put out by these.
[02:06:43.873 --> 02:06:48.756]  The fact is, it's 20 to 50 times, depending on which machine, the radiation they previously said.
[02:06:49.296 --> 02:06:51.838]  And now they've announced they have at least 500 mobile vans.
[02:06:54.628 --> 02:07:09.734]  With private contractors, and they give them to police departments as well, driving around with powerful x-ray backscatter machines with at least ten times the power of a chest x-ray shooting it through our homes.
[02:07:10.174 --> 02:07:11.735]  Think how far America's come.
[02:07:12.395 --> 02:07:17.457]  That they're on the news going, yeah, there's 500 vans driving around looking for your walls.
[02:07:18.057 --> 02:07:19.398]  Whatever happened to the Fourth Amendment?
[02:07:20.779 --> 02:07:21.420]  Think about that.
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:30.167]  And that the people running those machines are under federal laws for radiation, like somebody who's a radiologist and a dental officer in a hospital.
[02:07:31.188 --> 02:07:34.431]  And they've got these people sitting in these vans.
[02:07:35.052 --> 02:07:36.253]  They're the ones that are going to die.
[02:07:36.273 --> 02:07:44.500]  I mean, if you get x-rayed a few times with a van driving down the street, you're not going to... It's going to hurt you, but not that bad compared to the people who are being given a death sentence.
[02:07:44.981 --> 02:07:45.401]  These people
[02:07:47.185 --> 02:07:48.706]  We're good to go.
[02:08:10.814 --> 02:08:18.456]  to see if they can get away with putting it out, it killing people, and the media just basically says, oh, it's no big deal.
[02:08:18.916 --> 02:08:24.518]  Kind of like four years ago, Gardasil supposedly protects women from human papillomavirus.
[02:08:25.178 --> 02:08:28.479]  But you read the insert, boy, you find out a lot reading vaccine inserts.
[02:08:28.839 --> 02:08:29.779]  I recommend you read it.
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:35.341]  And it said, this doesn't protect you from human papillomavirus or cervical cancer.
[02:08:36.521 --> 02:08:39.422]  And it only covers four to six of the hundreds of strains
[02:08:41.459 --> 02:08:45.362]  In studies and in trials, it does kill some people.
[02:08:46.944 --> 02:08:48.825]  And in the trials, all these women died.
[02:08:48.845 --> 02:08:54.370]  And then I see the local newscast all over the country, people send me on YouTube, where my daughter was a 12-year-old cheerleader.
[02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:58.934]  We gave her the shot and for four days, blood poured out of every orifice and she died.
[02:08:59.855 --> 02:09:05.980]  And the doctors say, yeah, the shot kills you, but it's worth it because it might save somebody from cancer.
[02:09:07.796 --> 02:09:11.678]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Salk was the head of the World Eugenics Society.
[02:09:12.598 --> 02:09:18.601]  We've got videos of him laughing about the SV40 cancer viruses on record they put in polio shots.
[02:09:18.981 --> 02:09:23.043]  There's a reason cancer's up by over 2,000 or 3,000 percent.
[02:09:23.423 --> 02:09:28.285]  And all we've got to do is face the horror that they're doing this to us.
[02:09:28.946 --> 02:09:33.908]  And then we've got to face the horror that Bill Gates, whose dad ended up land-parenting the eugenicists,
[02:09:40.159 --> 02:09:48.084]  Getting up on TED TV and saying, here's the equation, we've got to cut the human carbon footprint, we've got to get rid of most of the people.
[02:09:49.105 --> 02:09:56.030]  And we've got to face the harm that he's funding vaccine programs worldwide that is doing this to people.
[02:09:56.470 --> 02:10:08.699]  And we've got to stand up to this little smiley face demon when the media talks about what a great humanitarian he is, and how much he cares about us, and recognize that he's a little Adolf Hitler.
[02:10:14.943 --> 02:10:15.164]  Hey!
[02:10:16.411 --> 02:10:17.296]  I'm gonna say this again.
[02:10:22.984 --> 02:10:24.225]  I am way beyond fear.
[02:10:24.785 --> 02:10:31.169]  Because when you actually dig in to the confirmed... I mean, everything I've told you here, you can just search the term and see videos of that admitting it.
[02:10:31.869 --> 02:10:32.790]  That's how bold they are.
[02:10:33.210 --> 02:10:36.992]  When you realize that what I've told you is the truth and beyond.
[02:10:37.392 --> 02:10:38.633]  It's worse than I'm saying.
[02:10:38.813 --> 02:10:39.514]  Many fold!
[02:10:39.934 --> 02:10:40.714]  By many levels.
[02:10:41.215 --> 02:10:46.978]  When you realize that eugenics started in England, became all powerful in the United States.
[02:10:47.338 --> 02:10:50.980]  In 35 states, they sterilized whoever they wanted, even into the 1980s.
[02:10:52.642 --> 02:10:57.887]  They took babies at birth that were born in government institutions and drowned them.
[02:10:58.467 --> 02:11:00.489]  Or did medical experiments on them.
[02:11:00.689 --> 02:11:01.710]  It's all public.
[02:11:02.010 --> 02:11:07.875]  When you realize that, you understand just how out of control this system is.
[02:11:08.176 --> 02:11:13.921]  And it doesn't matter if you're a school teacher, or in the military, or a police officer, or anybody else.
[02:11:14.281 --> 02:11:18.025]  You are a piece of trash to the globalists.
[02:11:18.505 --> 02:11:20.787]  And I know there are people here that are doubters tonight.
[02:11:21.027 --> 02:11:23.310]  There are undoubtedly FBI people here tonight.
[02:11:23.550 --> 02:11:26.112]  There are undoubtedly private contractors here tonight.
[02:11:26.413 --> 02:11:34.200]  And all I ask is that you have the courage to go search the terms and the information I put out tonight and to find out it's true.
[02:11:49.737 --> 02:11:50.517]  A.K.A.
[02:11:50.797 --> 02:11:51.217]  George R.R.
[02:11:51.317 --> 02:11:51.577]  Martin.
[02:11:52.778 --> 02:11:59.359]  Because Eric Blair came from a elite family, an intellectual family, in England.
[02:11:59.839 --> 02:12:06.800]  He was sent as a young man to India to be a part of the Imperial Police, suppressing hundreds of millions of Indians, just a few thousand British.
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:10.981]  And he was sent there, and he didn't like the immoral things he did to Indians.
[02:12:11.621 --> 02:12:12.081]  In India.
[02:12:13.701 --> 02:12:16.842]  So, he said, well, the Communists are against this.
[02:12:17.582 --> 02:12:18.782]  So he went and joined the Communists.
[02:12:19.491 --> 02:12:20.992]  and fought in the Spanish Civil War.
[02:12:21.792 --> 02:12:25.213]  Then he found out how corrupt they were, so he wanted to fight Hitler.
[02:12:25.593 --> 02:12:29.595]  So he went to work as a propagandist for the BBC during World War II.
[02:12:31.575 --> 02:12:34.436]  And so his character in 1984 is Winston Smith.
[02:12:35.236 --> 02:12:37.777]  He's the guy from the Ministry of Tribune.
[02:12:37.877 --> 02:12:42.179]  And I'm not telling you what he thought his book was about, I'm telling you what he said about it.
[02:12:43.783 --> 02:12:45.305]  And George Orwell talked about Crimestop.
[02:12:45.345 --> 02:12:45.885]  Crimestop.
[02:13:06.089 --> 02:13:07.650]  He was in the party.
[02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:12.913]  90% of the population of Airstrip One, this fictitious 1984 Anglo-American tyranny.
[02:13:21.348 --> 02:13:23.749]  Orwell wrote a letter that he believed this is what was actually going to happen.
[02:13:23.769 --> 02:13:25.750]  It just happened a little bit late.
[02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:43.156]  And he wrote in the book about Crimestop where members of the secret police, members of the propaganda corps, when Big Brother would get up there and announce, we've always been at war with East Asia.
[02:13:43.176 --> 02:13:47.618]  And the next day, Big Brother would say, we've never been at war with East Asia.
[02:13:48.598 --> 02:13:50.039]  It was the smartest people.
[02:13:52.406 --> 02:13:56.008]  Not the dumbest, but the smartest who knew how to flip it around in their mind.
[02:13:56.788 --> 02:13:58.469]  Who knew how to make excuses for it.
[02:13:59.049 --> 02:14:03.252]  Oh, well, he said we were always at War Relief Station, but now we've never been at War Relief Station.
[02:14:03.712 --> 02:14:11.256]  It was the mark of an inner party member that they were able to rationalize what they were doing.
[02:14:11.994 --> 02:14:14.076]  And I've had special forces commanders on.
[02:14:14.096 --> 02:14:16.138]  I've had former top CIA analysts on.
[02:14:16.158 --> 02:14:18.180]  I've had former heads of state on.
[02:14:19.061 --> 02:14:25.967]  And when you confront them with, well, it's on the news, our government grows the opium, and they say, well, I just can't face that.
[02:14:29.755 --> 02:14:50.301]  Well, Anwar al-Awlaki, when I had Colonel Anthony Schaeffer on Friday, I said, well, Anwar al-Awlaki, number one in al-Qaeda right now, he's in secret Pentagon meetings, and he runs all the attacks, and it's clear the Pentagon's staging these attacks, and the Pentagon, you admit, blocked you from killing bin Laden back in 2001, a month before, and he says, yeah,
[02:14:52.923 --> 02:14:56.006]  I know how it looks, but I just can't believe that.
[02:14:57.267 --> 02:15:00.610]  See, see, see, that's the key.
[02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:15.563]  I have told you, I have told you on InfoWars.com, we have direct links to the Rockefeller Foundation, direct links to the 1996 United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment, direct links to reports by the State Department and the Random 200.
[02:15:20.816 --> 02:15:21.256]  It's real!
[02:15:21.276 --> 02:15:21.476]  It's real!
[02:15:21.536 --> 02:15:23.578]  It's so real, it's past even understanding.
[02:15:46.015 --> 02:15:48.937]  Because we cannot recognize evil.
[02:15:49.198 --> 02:15:53.681]  Because we've been trained from birth to rationalize and engage in crime stuff.
[02:15:55.022 --> 02:15:57.504]  We cannot face reality.
[02:15:58.685 --> 02:16:08.393]  But George Orwell, Eric Blair, pen name George Orwell, who had been on the imperial side, the communist side, the British propaganda side, he understood it.
[02:16:08.413 --> 02:16:09.534]  And what does his book talk about?
[02:16:09.875 --> 02:16:12.397]  Black helicopters looking through your walls with x-rays.
[02:16:13.117 --> 02:16:14.839]  Telescreens that watch your every move.
[02:16:15.874 --> 02:16:18.136]  Children being trained to spy and tattle on their parents.
[02:16:19.097 --> 02:16:21.338]  The language being reduced and destroyed.
[02:16:22.419 --> 02:16:36.190]  And then you learn that Eric Blair, his family, was married into the Wedgwoods, the Huxleys, the Darlings, and this group of people that developed everything that we are now living under today.
[02:16:36.851 --> 02:16:37.972]  They had the vision.
[02:16:38.893 --> 02:16:40.454]  And they knew what they were doing.
[02:16:40.774 --> 02:16:41.975]  And I'll tell you about somebody else.
[02:16:43.496 --> 02:16:44.337]  Aldous Huxley.
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:54.142]  1932.
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:54.142]  He writes a book about the government dumbing children down at birth through chemicals in their food.
[02:16:54.502 --> 02:16:57.923]  He writes a book about genetic dictatorship through DNA.
[02:16:59.323 --> 02:17:02.944]  Supposedly 15 years before they discovered DNA.
[02:17:05.045 --> 02:17:06.785]  But he even described the double helix.
[02:17:07.526 --> 02:17:11.187]  They discovered DNA a long time before they told you.
[02:17:12.657 --> 02:17:16.920]  They discovered atomic weapons a long time before Max Planck published his book.
[02:17:18.321 --> 02:17:21.824]  The truth is, we don't know exactly what's going on.
[02:17:23.826 --> 02:17:26.728]  As far as I've gone in research, it's just what's admitted.
[02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:30.912]  Can you imagine what else is going on?
[02:17:32.013 --> 02:17:33.154]  The history we've been given.
[02:17:33.174 --> 02:17:33.855]  Everything.
[02:17:34.875 --> 02:17:37.458]  You've got to question it.
[02:17:38.464 --> 02:17:40.925]  The system will also sow dissent.
[02:17:40.965 --> 02:17:42.706]  It will try to confuse you.
[02:17:42.726 --> 02:17:44.727]  It will try to tell you you don't have any personal power.
[02:17:45.388 --> 02:17:50.310]  At the end of the day, you have that guiding light in your soul, your intellect, your spirit.
[02:17:50.330 --> 02:17:53.232]  And you know, individually, you're a good man.
[02:17:53.332 --> 02:17:54.072]  You're a good woman.
[02:17:54.312 --> 02:17:55.193]  You're a good person.
[02:17:55.233 --> 02:17:56.614]  You want good things for people.
[02:17:56.734 --> 02:17:57.854]  You're not a control freak.
[02:17:57.914 --> 02:17:58.855]  You don't like pain.
[02:17:59.095 --> 02:18:00.155]  You don't like suffering.
[02:18:00.456 --> 02:18:02.717]  You like a fat little chihuahua sitting in your lap.
[02:18:03.417 --> 02:18:05.339]  You like being nice to your neighbor.
[02:18:05.899 --> 02:18:08.161]  You know you're a good person.
[02:18:09.042 --> 02:18:14.187]  And it is your responsibility to be a leader.
[02:18:15.227 --> 02:18:18.911]  And to carry on for those that came before you like Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:18:18.931 --> 02:18:20.072]  I don't know if he's still here tonight.
[02:18:30.714 --> 02:18:37.459]  I talk about this more and more because something genetic happens, something in your coding happens when you have children.
[02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:45.425]  That's when you really begin your self-dying.
[02:18:46.306 --> 02:18:55.613]  That's when you have a love so deep, my love for my children blows away my love for my parents, and I love my parents so much.
[02:18:57.156 --> 02:19:01.060]  My love for my children, my wife, can't even compare.
[02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:02.961]  And she agrees, she's the same way.
[02:19:03.622 --> 02:19:05.403]  Because that's humanity, that's the future.
[02:19:05.443 --> 02:19:24.220]  When you look at a little two-year-old boy or girl, full of light and love and discovery, and you see the electric power in their eyes, and you realize how wondrous they are, and you think about how the globalists want to destroy them and fill them full of evil, with all their culture of death,
[02:19:26.616 --> 02:19:27.537]  Then there's no more fear.
[02:19:28.698 --> 02:19:29.539]  There's no more fear.
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:40.051]  At the moment you realize that the greatest expression of the human spirit is what Jesus Christ talked about, laying your life down for another.
[02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:41.653]  The globalists
[02:19:49.531 --> 02:19:54.013]  The globalists, they always magazine self and me and all this other stuff.
[02:19:54.733 --> 02:20:01.556]  When they sell you on being self-centered, they train these foolish people that that's how you get ahead and cheating people is fun.
[02:20:01.936 --> 02:20:09.219]  But when you create a culture where everybody else is doing it, there's no solace, there's no safe house, there's no honor, there's no trust.
[02:20:10.039 --> 02:20:12.600]  I mean, wealth is people you can trust and love.
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:14.161]  Wealth is family.
[02:20:14.241 --> 02:20:15.221]  Wealth is friends.
[02:20:15.681 --> 02:20:17.502]  Wealth are those people you can count on.
[02:20:25.151 --> 02:20:27.376]  True wealth is fidelity.
[02:20:27.817 --> 02:20:29.381]  True wealth is family.
[02:20:29.441 --> 02:20:30.784]  True wealth is friendship.
[02:20:30.824 --> 02:20:31.987]  That's all there is.
[02:20:32.789 --> 02:20:34.573]  Everything else is going to pass away.
[02:20:35.489 --> 02:20:42.451]  There's an old Norse saying that cattle die and kinsmen die, but I know there's one thing that never dies, and that's the fame of a dead man's deeds.
[02:20:43.011 --> 02:20:43.792]  But it's more than that.
[02:20:43.952 --> 02:20:45.232]  It wasn't good deeds.
[02:20:45.252 --> 02:20:48.393]  Because the people that did bad deeds, they're remembered in a bad way.
[02:20:48.833 --> 02:20:57.216]  But it isn't just being remembered, it's that people that come after you will use you as an example and as a model to do the right thing as well.
[02:20:57.536 --> 02:20:59.056]  People need those examples.
[02:20:59.096 --> 02:21:04.538]  They need those models to expand and build upon the good that came before us.
[02:21:04.938 --> 02:21:10.859]  As I started this talk, talking about the people going back 50 years ago that went through all sorts of persecution.
[02:21:11.219 --> 02:21:17.640]  It's easy to be Alex Jones today, despite the threats and the attacks and the demonization by the media and the think tanks and the government.
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:18.400]  It's easy!
[02:21:18.961 --> 02:21:21.581]  Because I can go anywhere I want and speak to thousands of people.
[02:21:22.321 --> 02:21:27.102]  I can see the rising tide of the awakening and all the good things that are happening.
[02:21:27.122 --> 02:21:32.683]  Imagine being people 50 years ago who did the original research that's brought us to where we are.
[02:21:33.243 --> 02:21:38.965]  When people were so gullible because they were so good, they couldn't believe evil.
[02:21:39.425 --> 02:21:46.007]  Think about the persecution that folks have gone through to bring us this information, to bring us to the point we are today.
[02:21:46.287 --> 02:21:47.487]  This is a long fight.
[02:21:48.388 --> 02:21:52.589]  And we're not going to have immediate success at every level right away.
[02:21:53.189 --> 02:21:54.289]  It takes time.
[02:21:54.589 --> 02:21:57.670]  The globalists built this tyranny over a long period.
[02:21:57.690 --> 02:21:59.591]  As they say, Rome wasn't built in a day.
[02:22:00.894 --> 02:22:04.057]  And it is going to take us a long time to reconstruct it.
[02:22:04.497 --> 02:22:12.325]  And we have to be careful that in the process of pulling down this tyranny, we don't set up new forms of tyranny in its place.
[02:22:13.045 --> 02:22:14.667]  That's why I'm against violent revolution.
[02:22:15.508 --> 02:22:18.150]  At a very primitive level, it's something that's very inviting.
[02:22:18.891 --> 02:22:21.173]  It's something that seems immediate and simple.
[02:22:22.264 --> 02:22:24.005]  But our enemies are planning on that.
[02:22:24.065 --> 02:22:26.386]  They're hoping we engage in violence.
[02:22:26.426 --> 02:22:28.947]  They're hoping that we take up arms.
[02:22:29.447 --> 02:22:32.888]  They're hoping to make war against free humanity.
[02:22:33.128 --> 02:22:37.370]  Instead of us becoming brothers and sisters with their would-be enforcers.
[02:22:37.810 --> 02:22:42.732]  Instead of us in good, decent, honest communion with their would-be servants.
[02:22:42.752 --> 02:22:51.816]  Instead of us unlocking their servants' minds, they hope that we are in war with them to wipe them out.
[02:22:52.739 --> 02:22:56.406]  So a new, more vicious group can be brought in.
[02:22:56.426 --> 02:22:58.710]  And that's the secret.
[02:22:59.291 --> 02:23:03.037]  It takes a lot more courage to let somebody attack you.
[02:23:04.159 --> 02:23:06.001]  Than to even stand up against them.
[02:23:06.921 --> 02:23:08.142]  And I'm all for defense.
[02:23:08.783 --> 02:23:13.226]  But offensive attacks are the work of the globalists.
[02:23:13.567 --> 02:23:15.008]  They are the people that attack.
[02:23:15.228 --> 02:23:16.509]  They are the people that invade.
[02:23:16.549 --> 02:23:17.910]  They are the people that preempt.
[02:23:18.371 --> 02:23:19.491]  You never attack.
[02:23:19.952 --> 02:23:21.113]  You only defend.
[02:23:21.693 --> 02:23:24.496]  And the pen is mightier than the sword.
[02:23:25.176 --> 02:23:30.400]  But that doesn't mean... That doesn't mean there's not a time to physically defend yourself.
[02:23:30.721 --> 02:23:33.443]  And we should make preparations for that as well.
[02:23:42.779 --> 02:23:53.208]  Because, as the founder of the Texas Rangers said, no man in the wrong can stand up against a man in the right who keeps on a coming.
[02:23:57.331 --> 02:23:58.292]  And that's the secret.
[02:23:59.473 --> 02:24:00.754]  Keep on a coming.
[02:24:01.035 --> 02:24:06.079]  Realize that every little thing you do, that act of goodness, that act of doing right,
[02:24:10.759 --> 02:24:11.840]  Alright, running through all these points.
[02:24:41.496 --> 02:24:44.077]  Gosh, I write these down and it just gives me a headache to even look at them.
[02:24:46.198 --> 02:24:51.501]  Let's briefly talk about what our world will become if they win.
[02:24:53.201 --> 02:24:54.622]  And I know they're not going to succeed.
[02:24:56.003 --> 02:25:00.485]  But if you read their writings, what will the world look like if they succeed?
[02:25:02.126 --> 02:25:06.548]  Our entire planet will be a giant graveyard.
[02:25:08.291 --> 02:25:11.133]  Of the billions and billions of people that they killed.
[02:25:12.014 --> 02:25:12.834]  Through war.
[02:25:13.675 --> 02:25:14.475]  Through famine.
[02:25:15.956 --> 02:25:17.817]  Through half your block having cancer.
[02:25:19.218 --> 02:25:21.400]  But don't worry, they have a fundraiser for that.
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:24.842]  Everybody gets to be part of a club and be like a movie star.
[02:25:25.202 --> 02:25:25.923]  Oh, you're dying.
[02:25:25.943 --> 02:25:26.403]  No, no, no.
[02:25:26.423 --> 02:25:28.204]  Give some money to the Cancer Research Program.
[02:25:28.865 --> 02:25:29.905]  They'll take care of it for you.
[02:25:30.306 --> 02:25:35.069]  They turn everything into a pageant, into a play, into some type of sick celebrity.
[02:25:36.781 --> 02:25:39.943]  If we don't defeat them, this is what the globalists are going to do.
[02:25:39.963 --> 02:25:42.084]  It doesn't mean it's going to happen, it's what they want.
[02:25:42.644 --> 02:25:50.409]  They're going to merge with computers, so in some delusional fashion they say we'll live forever because our intellects will be downloaded in a computer.
[02:25:50.609 --> 02:25:52.490]  Again, I don't know if that's what they say they're doing.
[02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:53.651]  These people are nuts.
[02:25:55.732 --> 02:26:00.235]  And we're not going to be here, and their progeny are going to go forward.
[02:26:01.135 --> 02:26:05.878]  And in every writing they put out, whether it's Kurzweil, you name it,
[02:26:08.109 --> 02:26:15.814]  They talk about how they don't care what we say, they don't care what we do, they're just going to do it and we can't stop them.
[02:26:16.795 --> 02:26:17.875]  But that's a con game.
[02:26:18.816 --> 02:26:25.881]  I can't tell you how many times I've confronted world leaders or others that I and others have inspired like We Are Change and the things they've done.
[02:26:26.401 --> 02:26:27.242]  When you confront
[02:26:33.322 --> 02:26:53.191]  When you confront a David Rockefeller, or a Ted Turner, or a Bill Clinton, or a George W. Bush, or a Joe Biden, or Barack Obama, or Hillary Clinton, when you confront them calmly and in a focused way, they are horrified.
[02:26:53.931 --> 02:26:55.772]  They are scared.
[02:26:56.152 --> 02:27:01.495]  Because they know that humanity is awake and staring at them.
[02:27:02.657 --> 02:27:12.083]  But if they succeed, if they have their way, it's just too horrible to imagine.
[02:27:12.143 --> 02:27:21.490]  You know, I hate to go back to Hitler, because that's a very sad and sickening subject in human history, because it was so cold and scientific what they did.
[02:27:22.831 --> 02:27:25.973]  But it all came from the United States and England, on record.
[02:27:27.454 --> 02:27:30.596]  And they got embarrassed by Hitler.
[02:27:32.242 --> 02:27:34.883]  And they packaged it in a liberal packaging.
[02:27:35.304 --> 02:27:37.965]  Margaret Sanger gave awards to Hitler, got awards from him.
[02:27:37.985 --> 02:27:39.546]  She's been Time Magazine Woman of the Year.
[02:27:39.606 --> 02:27:40.386]  They still honor her.
[02:27:40.406 --> 02:27:43.188]  This is a woman they call Black People Suck Human Weeds.
[02:27:44.738 --> 02:27:45.918]  Now where's Jesse Jackson?
[02:27:45.938 --> 02:27:55.320]  You've got a woman being friends with all those black people, sub-human weeds, but then they all obsess over race issues and get everybody hyped up about it, only to fight with each other.
[02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:57.540]  That's an example of what we're talking about.
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:01.221]  These are monstrous, monstrous people.
[02:28:02.101 --> 02:28:07.622]  And I just want to tell people, a real Nazi, that's the best way to describe a eugenicist in a popular term.
[02:28:07.842 --> 02:28:08.482]  It's well known.
[02:28:09.623 --> 02:28:11.063]  The best way to describe a Nazi
[02:28:12.099 --> 02:28:17.162]  It's not your loving liberal down the street that's feeding the homeless and cares about the environment.
[02:28:17.362 --> 02:28:23.325]  They're useful idiots, just like most Tea Party people are, you know, who support mainline Republicans.
[02:28:23.345 --> 02:28:23.965]  They mean well.
[02:28:25.326 --> 02:28:33.310]  But when you get down to a foundation liberal, a Rockefeller foundation, a high level NPR person, if you really talk to them, if you really read their
[02:28:36.431 --> 02:28:38.052]  We're good to go.
[02:29:06.303 --> 02:29:07.263]  You need to understand that.
[02:29:07.583 --> 02:29:08.844]  They hate you so much.
[02:29:09.104 --> 02:29:11.845]  And by the way, they're not just killing people that got brown skin.
[02:29:11.885 --> 02:29:12.725]  They hate everybody.
[02:29:13.725 --> 02:29:21.068]  Another facet of eugenics we talked about earlier is that they call it positive and negative eugenics.
[02:29:21.108 --> 02:29:22.448]  That's in the lower level writings.
[02:29:22.488 --> 02:29:30.931]  Like, we're going to breed the elites together for longer longevity, better looks, everything else, and we're going to kind of kill off the dumb people.
[02:29:32.165 --> 02:29:32.965]  That's evil.
[02:29:33.466 --> 02:29:43.249]  But when you really read high-level eugenics, they say, actually, our main mission is to kill the best and brightest, because they'll compete with us.
[02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:45.750]  Think about that.
[02:29:46.031 --> 02:29:49.232]  For all you out there, well, I've got 140 IQ, you know, I'm successful.
[02:29:49.252 --> 02:29:53.394]  I talk to a lot of so-called liberals, they go, well, Alex, there are too many people.
[02:29:54.794 --> 02:29:56.715]  Well, you're like, they're part of the system.
[02:29:57.155 --> 02:29:58.836]  I was like,
[02:30:00.354 --> 02:30:02.135]  Yeah, I notice you're 35 years old.
[02:30:02.155 --> 02:30:03.976]  You and your wife are trying to have a kid for five years.
[02:30:06.577 --> 02:30:09.439]  Who listens to all this propaganda about not having children?
[02:30:10.339 --> 02:30:11.400]  It's the best and brightest.
[02:30:13.061 --> 02:30:19.484]  See, they'll kill off the poor and the people they think are, quote, subhumans later.
[02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:22.746]  The real people they want to kill.
[02:30:23.701 --> 02:30:28.945]  The real apple of their eye that they want to dumb down are people that come from good families.
[02:30:28.985 --> 02:30:33.287]  You can be black, you can be Indian, you can be white, you can be Jewish, you can be Chinese, they don't care.
[02:30:34.148 --> 02:30:38.351]  They are chronicling in the schools through computerized actuaries.
[02:30:38.471 --> 02:30:39.872]  The teacher doesn't even know what they're looking at.
[02:30:53.641 --> 02:30:55.783]  I've got the former head of policy
[02:31:15.509 --> 02:31:16.950]  There have been ancient cultures of suppression.
[02:31:16.970 --> 02:31:18.891]  There have been many forms of tyranny.
[02:31:44.707 --> 02:31:50.193]  And there have been many systems run by tyrannical women, and many systems run by tyrannical men.
[02:31:50.914 --> 02:31:57.581]  But at the end of the equation, you have to realize that a man is not the human species, a woman is not the human species.
[02:31:58.002 --> 02:32:01.065]  The man and the woman form to make our species.
[02:32:03.007 --> 02:32:06.291]  Just like the DNA is intertwined, men and women are intertwined.
[02:32:06.894 --> 02:32:13.519]  And the minute that they can break that bond between men and women, the minute they can train us to fight with each other.
[02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:27.510]  Because the women have been trained to be floozies, the men have been trained to be lazy, sports addicts, scum, they've already tried our economy, they've already tried our society, they've already screwed us up really bad, but don't worry, they've always got the answer to fix it.
[02:32:27.871 --> 02:32:29.392]  And that's break up the family more.
[02:32:30.173 --> 02:32:32.294]  They want to isolate all of us.
[02:32:32.915 --> 02:32:35.317]  Families aren't perfect, there's a lot of problems out there.
[02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:43.969]  But at the end of the day, the globalist family is scientifically coming after our individual human family so they can corner us.
[02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:47.413]  So they can corner us by ourselves.
[02:32:48.114 --> 02:32:56.223]  If you go back 5, 6,000, 7,000, 10,000 years ago to humans, anywhere in the world, cornered, surrounded by wild animals in the night.
[02:32:59.514 --> 02:33:10.597]  Well, if you were a cave bear or that saber-toothed cat I was talking about, if you could get a human, the strongest male and the weakest child, if you could get them alone, what's going to happen?
[02:33:12.497 --> 02:33:13.117]  Dinner time.
[02:33:13.997 --> 02:33:14.518]  Dinner time.
[02:33:14.838 --> 02:33:18.338]  So, you better find some family, even if it's not your genetic family.
[02:33:18.639 --> 02:33:22.719]  You better find people that have the same mindset, the same understanding, the same spirit.
[02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:28.861]  You better get with people, because that's the most valuable thing going into this contrived, controlled depression.
[02:33:29.441 --> 02:33:36.064]  Is to have people you can count on who are of the same mind and accord, who will stand together against this evil.
[02:33:36.304 --> 02:33:38.185]  That is the most important thing.
[02:33:38.445 --> 02:33:49.430]  And that's why they divide us on sex, they divide us on race, they divide us on religion, they divide us on every front, so we can be isolated and controlled by this system.
[02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:53.831]  But it is through unity against their tyranny that we have victory.
[02:33:54.552 --> 02:33:57.453]  They atomize, they atomize
[02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:10.273]  They divide and conquer our society and then go, oh, look at all this disunity.
[02:34:11.374 --> 02:34:12.635]  We've got unity.
[02:34:13.675 --> 02:34:15.056]  You didn't have a daddy at home?
[02:34:15.516 --> 02:34:18.598]  Join the big gang in the sky, the military.
[02:34:18.898 --> 02:34:20.879]  Join the big gang in the sky, the police.
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:23.041]  We'll give you a gang mentality.
[02:34:23.281 --> 02:34:24.541]  Police will read the gang handbook.
[02:34:24.561 --> 02:34:25.502]  Look at yourself.
[02:34:25.522 --> 02:34:26.423]  This is how they set it up.
[02:34:26.903 --> 02:34:28.084]  You didn't have a daddy at home?
[02:34:28.544 --> 02:34:29.524]  Now you're going to have a daddy.
[02:34:29.564 --> 02:34:30.285]  He's your sergeant.
[02:34:31.265 --> 02:34:33.627]  But this daddy's going to tell you to put a durang in a stick for you.
[02:34:34.684 --> 02:34:37.266]  This daddy's going to tell you vaccines for poisons are good.
[02:34:37.926 --> 02:34:42.270]  This daddy's going to tell you having biological weapons tested on you is good.
[02:34:42.310 --> 02:34:44.011]  This daddy's done down there too.
[02:34:44.671 --> 02:34:47.233]  But the big daddies up on top, they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:34:48.694 --> 02:34:58.661]  So the state destroys our culture, destroys our humanity, removes the basic moorings of what it is to be a human, and the basic rituals and rites that we all want to go through.
[02:34:58.922 --> 02:35:01.884]  They destroy all those rites in their natural position.
[02:35:03.467 --> 02:35:06.911]  In our local area, in our family, and they give us false rights.
[02:35:07.671 --> 02:35:10.014]  False rituals of being a human.
[02:35:10.234 --> 02:35:15.680]  And they take us through those false rituals and people are given a false counterfeit fulfillment.
[02:35:17.582 --> 02:35:18.343]  Is this making sense?
[02:35:23.131 --> 02:35:25.032]  But it doesn't matter if you don't have a family.
[02:35:25.112 --> 02:35:26.873]  It doesn't even matter if you don't have friends.
[02:35:27.413 --> 02:35:39.440]  You've got the instincts, you've got the guts, you've got the hard wiring that God put into you, and you've got a family of billions of our ancestors that go before us and billions of our progeny that go after us.
[02:35:39.941 --> 02:35:44.103]  And in that, you have unlimited strength the minute you tap into it!
[02:35:54.582 --> 02:35:58.043]  So the globalists are on their ultimate power trip, and I think they've done it all once.
[02:35:58.243 --> 02:35:59.984]  But now we see fear in their eyes.
[02:36:00.964 --> 02:36:02.225]  Not just fear of us, though.
[02:36:03.145 --> 02:36:06.606]  I've talked to some very high-level globalists off the record.
[02:36:06.766 --> 02:36:08.047]  People say, well, I'm as chill as they are.
[02:36:08.347 --> 02:36:12.188]  Well, if I did that, I would break my journalistic code if somebody said this is off the record.
[02:36:12.308 --> 02:36:13.028]  That's why they talk to me.
[02:36:13.549 --> 02:36:16.770]  The police send me secret government documents with a training to confiscate our guns.
[02:36:16.850 --> 02:36:18.230]  I put it out on the next national news.
[02:36:18.450 --> 02:36:21.551]  People say, well, tell us your stories, even after it's admitted to be real documents.
[02:36:21.892 --> 02:36:22.292]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:22.572 --> 02:36:22.872]  Tell me.
[02:36:23.553 --> 02:36:25.435]  I'll tell you the story so they never talk to me again.
[02:36:25.875 --> 02:36:31.119]  Yeah, I'll blow my confidence and my integrity for you.
[02:36:31.399 --> 02:36:32.120]  That's another lie.
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:36.564]  But I've talked to people at some of the highest levels.
[02:36:36.624 --> 02:36:37.905]  An example is Rothkopf.
[02:36:38.085 --> 02:36:39.446]  This is on record so I can talk about it.
[02:36:39.486 --> 02:36:40.747]  The former head of the Kissinger Group.
[02:36:41.087 --> 02:36:43.069]  I got a call from his office about three years ago.
[02:36:43.409 --> 02:36:45.391]  He didn't come back for a long visit, I'll tell you.
[02:36:47.012 --> 02:36:50.293]  And he came on to explain to me how world government was good.
[02:36:50.373 --> 02:36:52.654]  Now there's 6,000 level managers for the elite.
[02:36:52.694 --> 02:36:53.654]  Now they have the whole plan.
[02:36:53.694 --> 02:36:54.875]  I should join with it.
[02:36:54.935 --> 02:36:56.816]  And he was giving me this great opportunity.
[02:36:56.836 --> 02:36:57.456]  This is on air!
[02:36:59.016 --> 02:36:59.597]  This is on air!
[02:37:00.837 --> 02:37:01.917]  Don't you want power?
[02:37:02.978 --> 02:37:05.539]  You know, because we're not perfect, but we're the best there is.
[02:37:05.559 --> 02:37:08.920]  Have you ever tried to, what, enlighten this rabble?
[02:37:10.208 --> 02:37:11.169]  They won't know what to do.
[02:37:11.449 --> 02:37:12.409]  You know, you're smart.
[02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:13.810]  You see what's going on.
[02:37:13.970 --> 02:37:14.851]  You ought to be with us.
[02:37:15.171 --> 02:37:17.572]  You ought to have disdain for the general public.
[02:37:20.334 --> 02:37:21.875]  And that basically was his message.
[02:37:24.456 --> 02:37:30.200]  And now I talk to people, and I talk to others, you know, folks of the highest levels.
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:33.442]  I talk to a medical doctor who's treated several heads of state.
[02:37:35.054 --> 02:37:55.861]  And let me tell you something, as they arrive at their final agenda, as they come to the edge of the cliff, as they get up there looking at the plunge they're about to take, like they're up on a 300-foot railroad crossing above a river, as they look down on what they're about to do, the globalists are not so much freaked out about us waking up,
[02:37:57.091 --> 02:38:00.133]  Because even though we've been dumbed down, we have an instinct that we're in danger.
[02:38:00.333 --> 02:38:02.955]  They tell you, you're freaked out inside because God's in turn.
[02:38:03.015 --> 02:38:05.957]  It's more like, no, no, we're freaked out because of you.
[02:38:06.057 --> 02:38:06.858]  Our God knows that.
[02:38:07.718 --> 02:38:11.321]  But the globalists aren't so much freaked out about us, they are to a certain extent.
[02:38:11.621 --> 02:38:14.523]  But we're a side issue to a certain extent.
[02:38:15.163 --> 02:38:16.885]  They're freaked out by their own agenda.
[02:38:17.145 --> 02:38:21.548]  They've schemed this, they've planned this, they've gotten all the way up to this point.
[02:38:23.889 --> 02:38:24.390]  And now,
[02:38:26.246 --> 02:38:28.207]  They're about to take the punch.
[02:38:29.147 --> 02:38:29.827]  All of them.
[02:38:30.348 --> 02:38:32.708]  Millions and millions killed in the soft kill weapons.
[02:38:33.369 --> 02:38:34.149]  All the wars.
[02:38:34.169 --> 02:38:35.570]  The million dead Iraqis.
[02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:36.430]  The DU.
[02:38:36.470 --> 02:38:38.511]  You know, let's give them the tricks.
[02:38:38.531 --> 02:38:39.411]  Let's have them use them.
[02:38:39.451 --> 02:38:41.812]  We'll test and see if it comes out for killing.
[02:38:42.832 --> 02:38:43.293]  All of it.
[02:38:43.353 --> 02:38:45.834]  We'll give them the H1N1 and kill and maim all these people.
[02:38:45.874 --> 02:38:47.934]  And so what if it happened last year and they got exposed?
[02:38:47.954 --> 02:38:48.775]  We'll do it again this year.
[02:38:49.115 --> 02:38:49.655]  So what if the British
[02:38:52.165 --> 02:38:54.586]  I don't think I feel so safe being with you people.
[02:39:20.706 --> 02:39:23.949]  I kind of like, you know, going to the Hollywood meetings and being cool.
[02:39:24.049 --> 02:39:25.790]  I kind of like big cities full of people.
[02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:27.572]  I kind of like the way things are.
[02:39:28.172 --> 02:39:33.016]  But the higher level Luciferians above them are saying, this program is in all trouble.
[02:39:33.637 --> 02:39:38.140]  Full steam ahead.
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:39.481]  Hey, I see Sheriff Malcolm there.
[02:39:39.762 --> 02:39:40.522]  You ever see him?
[02:39:48.649 --> 02:39:49.370]  Honestly guys, yes!
[02:39:49.390 --> 02:39:54.139]  I wonder if folks who didn't get it got the stand-by gig for $7-$9.
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:56.824]  Well, will you go stick around?
[02:39:57.746 --> 02:39:58.007]  Sure.
[02:39:58.047 --> 02:39:59.369]  Yeah, I want you to, absolutely.
[02:40:00.632 --> 02:40:04.313]  Hey, it's great, I come out to Santa Cruz, about to stand on a tee, Sheriff Richard Mack.
[02:40:04.653 --> 02:40:14.056]  But again, going back to an example, instead of getting all this super deep stuff, just a basic thing of an example of what one man on the right can do when he keeps on a coming.
[02:40:14.396 --> 02:40:21.159]  Sheriff Richard Mack, I don't know, 15 years ago, wherever it was, they were having gun cases where they were taking people's guns who hadn't even committed a crime.
[02:40:21.399 --> 02:40:22.719]  He went all the way to the Supreme Court and
[02:40:34.611 --> 02:40:35.991]  And Sheriff Richard Mack did that.
[02:40:37.252 --> 02:40:39.572]  And, you know, since then, he's been on my show many times.
[02:40:39.612 --> 02:40:48.095]  He has a best-selling book that is, instead of fighting with police, we're going to them and saying, you want to be part of the sacred honor and true duty to defend the Republic.
[02:40:48.795 --> 02:40:51.656]  Going to sheriffs, going to others and saying, here is your oath.
[02:40:52.056 --> 02:40:53.256]  Here's what it's really all about.
[02:40:53.656 --> 02:40:54.897]  You represent the people.
[02:40:55.217 --> 02:40:56.397]  You represent the county.
[02:40:56.637 --> 02:40:59.558]  You don't represent the offshore banks that have taken over our nation.
[02:41:00.818 --> 02:41:02.459]  And just the work he's done, from 10-15
[02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:07.171]  We're good to go.
[02:41:39.962 --> 02:41:43.484]  Because at the end of the day, that's the illusion.
[02:41:43.864 --> 02:41:49.607]  The police are with us, the people, even if they've been lied to and somehow think of themselves as part of the system.
[02:41:50.208 --> 02:41:54.049]  The system is going to take their pension funds, just like what's happening in Europe right now.
[02:41:54.330 --> 02:41:56.151]  The system doesn't give a damn about them.
[02:41:56.171 --> 02:41:58.912]  The system's going to hang them out to dry the minute it can.
[02:41:59.492 --> 02:42:08.196]  Only when the police stand with the people and the elected representatives of this republic are they peace officers and defenders of the republic.
[02:42:08.356 --> 02:42:12.097]  And now I give you a defender of the republic, Sheriff Richard Dunn!
[02:42:32.007 --> 02:42:32.828]  Thank you.
[02:42:33.209 --> 02:42:33.729]  Wow.
[02:42:34.450 --> 02:42:36.632]  I was just here a week ago, right, Dr. Monteith?
[02:42:37.473 --> 02:42:38.354]  Wow.
[02:42:39.054 --> 02:42:41.056]  I didn't know I was going to be here today.
[02:42:42.257 --> 02:42:48.584]  The Lord surely moves in mysterious ways, doesn't he?
[02:42:48.684 --> 02:42:53.648]  Actually, Alex and I have become very good friends, but this is the first time we've ever met in person.
[02:42:54.975 --> 02:42:56.977]  And it's always really great.
[02:42:56.997 --> 02:43:00.060]  So make sure somebody takes a picture of us later on.
[02:43:00.580 --> 02:43:02.442]  And I came in with Joe Bannister.
[02:43:10.249 --> 02:43:13.872]  And the guy that just had me here a week ago, we talked about him.
[02:43:13.932 --> 02:43:15.734]  Love to want to thank you on the stand up.
[02:43:15.774 --> 02:43:16.895]  Make sure you wave at everybody.
[02:43:16.935 --> 02:43:18.656]  Make sure they know where you are.
[02:43:24.819 --> 02:43:27.320]  How do you follow that?
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:31.901]  Yeah, Alex Jones, wow.
[02:43:33.522 --> 02:43:40.263]  The first thing that comes to my mind is, I'm not worthy.
[02:43:41.864 --> 02:43:45.145]  But I sure appreciate all of your support, a great deal.
[02:43:46.544 --> 02:43:49.047]  And this has been really a whirlwind tour.
[02:43:50.288 --> 02:43:52.831]  I can't even remember where I've been the last three weeks.
[02:43:52.991 --> 02:43:54.312]  All I know is I haven't been home.
[02:43:55.533 --> 02:43:57.295]  And my wife reminded me of that.
[02:43:57.315 --> 02:43:59.137]  I was actually supposed to fly home tonight.
[02:44:00.218 --> 02:44:06.304]  We found out about your event here and we postponed going home and we came here to be with you good people.
[02:44:14.121 --> 02:44:27.192]  We've got lots of solutions, but I think the most powerful one to do what Alex said, to keep this peaceful, is we've got to have our law enforcement and sheriffs on board with us.
[02:44:27.212 --> 02:44:29.534]  They've got to be on our side.
[02:44:29.654 --> 02:44:37.480]  And so I'm doing everything I can to educate them and to get them on board with doing one little thing, being an Oath Keeper.
[02:44:44.776 --> 02:44:56.426]  Back when I was sheriff, I decided that going along with the Brady Bill and the federal government was going to violate my oath of office, and I said no.
[02:44:57.207 --> 02:45:01.310]  And I decided that I was going to sue the federal government.
[02:45:01.330 --> 02:45:03.372]  I was going to sue the Clinton administration.
[02:45:04.353 --> 02:45:08.897]  And when I told that to my wife, I don't want any of you to think that she was all excited about that.
[02:45:10.660 --> 02:45:13.501]  Because she wasn't, and I wasn't.
[02:45:14.641 --> 02:45:15.561]  It scared me to death.
[02:45:15.621 --> 02:45:21.303]  You see, I'd seen those lists of people who crossed Bill Clinton, and I didn't want to be on it.
[02:45:22.563 --> 02:45:29.145]  And my wife really didn't want me to be on it either.
[02:45:29.205 --> 02:45:35.066]  And so, there was a time when I was doing all this that I thought, maybe I'm doing the wrong thing.
[02:45:35.547 --> 02:45:36.587]  And I said, I looked back,
[02:45:38.270 --> 02:45:40.452]  I have to tell you, I shouldn't have filed the lawsuit.
[02:45:42.253 --> 02:45:48.918]  I'm glad I have the decision now, because it entirely backs up the 10th Amendment, and what I believe is the solution.
[02:45:49.398 --> 02:45:50.559]  The solution is S.S.
[02:46:00.782 --> 02:46:13.359]  No one understand that it is not their prerogative, but it is their obligation and their duty to prevent the federal government from abusing you, we win.
[02:46:20.632 --> 02:46:22.253]  This is a peaceful solution.
[02:46:22.533 --> 02:46:23.774]  This is what I am about.
[02:46:23.814 --> 02:46:24.974]  That's what he is about.
[02:46:25.315 --> 02:46:32.518]  The solution can be peaceful and effective when we have local law enforcement, sheriffs, county attorneys.
[02:46:33.379 --> 02:46:35.740]  That's going to be a sketch.
[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:38.502]  County commissioners who know their duty.
[02:46:39.195 --> 02:46:50.544]  To put themselves in the way, as Madison expressed it, that we can safely rely on their disposition to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority.
[02:46:50.904 --> 02:47:01.872]  And as Madison also expressed it, that we actually interpose ourselves on behalf of the people to keep them safe and from becoming victims of the federal government's tyranny.
[02:47:02.533 --> 02:47:05.956]  We can keep that peaceful and effective and now
[02:47:07.668 --> 02:47:10.649]  Now that I'm being successful in this movement, what happens?
[02:47:11.489 --> 02:47:24.352]  Bob Schultz and I both are blasted as supporters of violence and legal force in Time Magazine in the October 12th issue just two weeks ago.
[02:47:24.412 --> 02:47:26.013]  Yeah, we're both in Time Magazine.
[02:47:26.133 --> 02:47:27.373]  It's on the front cover.
[02:47:27.813 --> 02:47:33.715]  It has some picture of some dangerous militia guy from Ohio.
[02:47:35.037 --> 02:47:35.917]  And I don't know him.
[02:47:36.957 --> 02:47:37.397]  Okay?
[02:47:37.918 --> 02:47:54.140]  And yet, the title of the article, front page, by this Bart Gellman guy, who I'd never heard of either before this, and he follows me around the country and wants to know what my solution is, and I keep telling him it's a peaceful one, and so what does he put in Time Magazine?
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:57.601]  That I support lethal force against the federal government.
[02:47:58.481 --> 02:48:00.541]  And it's all in, and so what is the article?
[02:48:01.082 --> 02:48:01.922]  The Secret World.
[02:48:03.942 --> 02:48:05.663]  Of extreme militias.
[02:48:07.043 --> 02:48:20.907]  And so, Sam Bushman from Liberty Roundtable calls the Bureau Chief, name is Mike Duffy, the Bureau Chief of Time Magazine in Washington, D.C., calls him, and he says, do you know Sheriff Mack?
[02:48:20.927 --> 02:48:22.788]  He says, yeah, I've seen his YouTube stuff.
[02:48:22.808 --> 02:48:25.569]  He says, is there anything secret?
[02:48:26.349 --> 02:48:27.629]  About what Sheriff Mike is doing?
[02:48:28.590 --> 02:48:30.330]  No, I don't have any evidence of that.
[02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:34.471]  Is there anything that shows that he's part of the militia movement?
[02:48:35.291 --> 02:48:37.772]  No, we don't have any evidence of that.
[02:48:38.052 --> 02:48:42.053]  Is there anything in his message that supports violence in any way?
[02:48:42.933 --> 02:48:43.973]  He refused to answer.
[02:48:44.974 --> 02:48:53.676]  And so I called the guy, the same guy too, and he says, Oh, Sheriff, we know we didn't do anything wrong, but we'll print any editorial you hand us.
[02:48:55.436 --> 02:48:57.356]  And I'll personally walk it through.
[02:48:58.057 --> 02:49:00.517]  But you obviously have other options.
[02:49:01.778 --> 02:49:04.078]  Well, I'm going to take advantage of those.
[02:49:04.118 --> 02:49:15.281]  So if any of you hear that we came in the money, it was from Time Magazine!
[02:49:15.381 --> 02:49:19.282]  I'll tell you, I got so excited hearing Alex, I don't want to take very long.
[02:49:19.702 --> 02:49:23.943]  So I want to get him back up here and maybe Joe Bannister can say a couple of things too.
[02:49:27.441 --> 02:49:29.382]  about my lawsuit against the federal government.
[02:49:30.242 --> 02:49:34.944]  We shouldn't have asked permission from the courts to keep our oath of office.
[02:49:36.244 --> 02:49:38.625]  State sovereignty isn't something you take to courts.
[02:49:38.886 --> 02:49:50.570]  State sovereignty is something you enforce, you implement, you stand with it as the ultimate check and balance against the federal government's improvements.
[02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:55.332]  There is something in the Constitution, there is a mechanism established by our founders
[02:49:55.984 --> 02:49:57.242]  Let's put us in...
[02:49:58.035 --> 02:50:00.857]  The policy to keep the federal government off our back.
[02:50:01.478 --> 02:50:02.819]  And it's called the 10th Amendment.
[02:50:03.559 --> 02:50:04.821]  It's called state sovereignty.
[02:50:05.221 --> 02:50:07.403]  It's called standing and doing what you know is right.
[02:50:07.503 --> 02:50:09.164]  Just everything Alex has been saying.
[02:50:09.704 --> 02:50:11.466]  But do that in your own backyard.
[02:50:11.946 --> 02:50:17.771]  If any of you think that that's going to happen in Washington, D.C., I've got beachfront property for you in Omaha.
[02:50:18.572 --> 02:50:21.214]  It's not going to happen there.
[02:50:21.334 --> 02:50:27.379]  And so, if you look at all the sheriffs in history that have ever sued the federal government, and
[02:50:28.314 --> 02:50:29.055]  I don't think so.
[02:50:56.941 --> 02:50:57.403]  You see?
[02:50:57.424 --> 02:50:58.972]  They've gone back.
[02:51:00.138 --> 02:51:01.720]  And they didn't make up something new.
[02:51:02.320 --> 02:51:03.941]  They didn't give their opinion.
[02:51:04.742 --> 02:51:11.167]  They supported the Founding Fathers' intent of the 10th Amendment and of states' rights.
[02:51:11.808 --> 02:51:15.331]  And they actually reinforced the Constitution.
[02:51:15.811 --> 02:51:17.793]  And that's why this ruling is so powerful.
[02:51:18.333 --> 02:51:19.294]  And you need to make sure.
[02:51:19.334 --> 02:51:24.638]  Go to SheriffMac.com and make sure you get some of these decisions yourself.
[02:51:25.239 --> 02:51:27.161]  Because I ran out in Sacramento.
[02:51:27.221 --> 02:51:28.342]  I would have brought them here tonight.
[02:51:29.222 --> 02:51:33.407]  But I have a little pocket-sized form, just like the pocket-sized constitutions.
[02:51:34.488 --> 02:51:36.030]  I have this Supreme Court decision.
[02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:38.172]  It's called the Victory for State Sovereignty.
[02:51:38.773 --> 02:51:40.275]  It's about 15 pages long.
[02:51:40.295 --> 02:51:50.226]  It takes 10 minutes to read about the principle that the Constitution protects us from our own best intentions.
[02:51:50.928 --> 02:52:07.973]  It divides power among sovereigns and among branches of government precisely so that we may resist the temptation to concentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day."
[02:52:08.793 --> 02:52:09.413]  End quote.
[02:52:10.473 --> 02:52:12.554]  You see, did you get that last part?
[02:52:12.574 --> 02:52:13.854]  The crisis of the day?
[02:52:15.155 --> 02:52:17.015]  What's the Obama administration motto?
[02:52:17.715 --> 02:52:19.376]  Never let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:52:20.985 --> 02:52:25.567]  And so now they actually bring out that principle in this decision, in the Matt Prince case.
[02:52:27.287 --> 02:52:30.009]  And he reinforces the power of the states.
[02:52:31.029 --> 02:52:41.433]  If every one of your local officials, your county officials, will support and defend and uphold the principle, that one sentence
[02:52:49.071 --> 02:52:49.611]  We win.
[02:52:50.491 --> 02:52:51.952]  We get our freedom back tomorrow.
[02:52:53.232 --> 02:52:57.093]  Never forget that we, the people, have the ultimate power.
[02:52:57.373 --> 02:52:58.554]  The 10th Amendment says it.
[02:52:59.014 --> 02:53:06.476]  That all powers not delegated to the federal government or the United States Congress are reserved to the states or to the people.
[02:53:07.556 --> 02:53:08.497]  This is where it's at.
[02:53:08.517 --> 02:53:09.837]  We can win all this.
[02:53:10.877 --> 02:53:12.198]  And now, before I sit down,
[02:53:13.343 --> 02:53:14.364]  I want to ask you one thing.
[02:53:15.404 --> 02:53:17.465]  I'm going to get political here for a second.
[02:53:18.265 --> 02:53:18.665]  Okay?
[02:53:20.206 --> 02:53:26.909]  If Ron Paul was running for governor in California on a third party ticket, would you vote for him?
[02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:43.535]  In fact, you can tell him, if he runs for president, I'll be his vice president.
[02:53:50.321 --> 02:53:51.843]  There's a Ron Paul run here.
[02:53:52.744 --> 02:53:55.106]  In California, on the third ticket.
[02:53:55.766 --> 02:53:59.449]  Her initials are Shaleen Nightingale.
[02:53:59.469 --> 02:54:00.791]  Okay?
[02:54:01.131 --> 02:54:02.152]  There's not a one.
[02:54:03.206 --> 02:54:04.227]  Okay guys, no one!
[02:54:04.467 --> 02:54:05.248]  I've endorsed her.
[02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:07.610]  I've put my life on the line with her.
[02:54:08.010 --> 02:54:09.412]  I've put my name with her.
[02:54:09.972 --> 02:54:17.639]  There's not anyone that should compromise their vote for those two mainstream candidates and think that that's going to get California anywhere.
[02:54:17.659 --> 02:54:20.181]  Vote in your conscience.
[02:54:20.482 --> 02:54:22.083]  Vote for the Ron Paul candidate.
[02:54:22.864 --> 02:54:24.425]  And let's take a stand for freedom.
[02:54:25.947 --> 02:54:26.647]  Last but not least.
[02:54:34.953 --> 02:54:42.678]  I'd just like to say this.
[02:54:42.758 --> 02:54:45.960]  It's an honor to share the stage with Alex.
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:47.181]  It's absolutely an honor.
[02:54:48.142 --> 02:54:50.904]  And in closing, I'd just like to leave you with one little thought.
[02:54:51.744 --> 02:54:58.249]  Of all the people that suit Bill Clinton, I was the only one to do so on a non-sexual matter.
[02:55:11.099 --> 02:55:27.733]  Let's get a question from this lady right here.
[02:55:27.773 --> 02:55:28.594]  Ma'am, go ahead.
[02:55:35.706 --> 02:55:36.686]  Thank you very much.
[02:55:37.487 --> 02:55:42.848]  I just wanted to say that the USAID is planning to expand their warfare testing in the Pacific Ocean.
[02:55:42.968 --> 02:55:51.071]  They're talking about taping, which means to kill and capture for rats, 32 species of marine mammals, plus using depleted uranium and other chemicals.
[02:55:51.711 --> 02:56:02.114]  And I was wondering if you could explain what the military is doing with these types of programs, plus the geoengineering and chemtrails programs that the Air Force are all tied in to what you're talking about tonight.
[02:56:02.654 --> 02:56:06.589]  Well, wonderful set of questions, and I could have spoken all night just on those three questions.
[02:56:08.450 --> 02:56:24.314]  Of all those issues, probably the least harmful, but it's horrible, but comparatively it's not as big as geoengineering and DU, is the fact that they're testing, in the last decade, high-powered sonar systems that can be heard throughout the entire ocean.
[02:56:25.094 --> 02:56:34.597]  Of course, sound travels at one speed in the atmosphere and another in the water, and every time the Navy tests these, whales en masse beach themselves, other marine mammals,
[02:56:35.417 --> 02:56:39.782]  And it just shows they'll give the troops DU to use as a weapon that ends up killing them over time.
[02:56:40.162 --> 02:56:44.387]  And they don't care if they're doing these sonar tests that end up killing whales.
[02:56:44.547 --> 02:56:53.237]  On the subject of geoengineering, chemtrails as they're known, I remember the old timers 15 years ago saying the government's spraying barium, salt, saline, dioxide, sulfur.
[02:56:53.677 --> 02:56:57.221]  And now the White House science arts come out and said basically they're playing God.
[02:56:57.781 --> 02:56:58.902]  Let's go to a question over here.
[02:56:58.922 --> 02:56:59.862]  Go ahead sir.
[02:57:24.490 --> 02:57:30.252]  That's just like San Francisco's where the UN was created.
[02:57:30.352 --> 02:57:36.594]  Well you know for every action there's an equal reaction.
[02:58:00.211 --> 02:58:00.451]  Yes.
[02:58:00.471 --> 02:58:02.193]  That's a good way of putting it.
[02:58:02.854 --> 02:58:04.556]  Multi-generational organized evil.
[02:58:04.576 --> 02:58:05.437]  I'm going to steal that term.
[02:58:08.842 --> 02:58:11.005]  I think we've said it in other ways, but it's very well said, sir.
[02:58:14.304 --> 02:58:18.386]  A lot of you people have seen some pamphlets on it.
[02:58:18.546 --> 02:58:29.052]  It's one form of organization, but we need to work from a position of integrity, of not pushing somebody down, but offering guidelines.
[02:58:29.112 --> 02:58:33.754]  So, I'm back from Russia, four years in Russia, and I know what's coming.
[02:58:34.075 --> 02:58:36.696]  I've lived it, okay?
[02:58:36.976 --> 02:58:39.918]  And it's just a super festive form of communism.
[02:58:40.839 --> 02:58:48.050]  But what I'm inviting, what I want to ask is how can we work with InfoWars, with you?
[02:58:48.210 --> 02:58:51.956]  Because you're the point on the sphere, alright?
[02:58:53.274 --> 02:58:54.235]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:58:54.255 --> 02:58:54.815]  God bless you.
[02:58:55.115 --> 02:58:57.877]  Look, I mean, I am part of the tip of the spear, as all of you are.
[02:58:57.897 --> 02:59:00.959]  I mean, I'm just trying to organize and run my operation.
[02:59:01.159 --> 02:59:04.081]  And hell, you know, I'm some guy that has trouble balancing my checkbook.
[02:59:04.121 --> 02:59:09.865]  So, I mean, when it comes to actual... Listen, what makes us so hard to stop is that we are unorganized.
[02:59:10.406 --> 02:59:13.328]  And if we all just take back our counties and our cities and our states,
[02:59:14.108 --> 02:59:19.431]  And if we inform people about Agenda 21 and the Globalist Plan, it's going to fall like a house of cards.
[02:59:19.511 --> 02:59:24.254]  As all of you resist in little ways every day, mainly by informing others, it's unstoppable.
[02:59:24.274 --> 02:59:25.515]  But God bless you.
[02:59:25.535 --> 02:59:26.495]  Keep up the great work, sir.
[02:59:26.936 --> 02:59:27.256]  Go ahead.
[02:59:29.977 --> 02:59:32.779]  The other day you had a guest on your show by the name of Lindsey Williams.
[02:59:33.179 --> 02:59:33.479]  Yes.
[02:59:33.940 --> 02:59:54.371]  And he mentioned that someone he knew, he didn't mention the name, had dinner with Janet DePalo of Home Medicine Theory, and that she had specifically told this anonymous person to go home immediately and prepare six months worth of food and water for her family.
[02:59:54.411 --> 02:59:55.972]  I just wanted to know what
[02:59:58.764 --> 03:00:00.465]  I know who Lindsay Williams was talking about.
[03:00:00.505 --> 03:00:04.347]  I separately knew about the person and asked him if that was her and he said yes.
[03:00:04.827 --> 03:00:07.328]  And I believe Lindsay, you know, does talk to these sources and say that.
[03:00:07.368 --> 03:00:19.574]  But, you know, just like the Feds, early last year, in January, were telling emergency managers and police heads all over the country that the flu was going to kill millions before it popped up, they tend to use fear
[03:00:20.854 --> 03:00:28.880]  On, this lady's also an elected representative you're talking about, they use fear to kind of get them to go along with it.
[03:00:28.940 --> 03:00:36.506]  Like there's been over a hundred that we know of staged terror attacks in the United States in the last nine years that were never announced on the news.
[03:00:37.246 --> 03:00:47.954]  But police are given quiet national security clearances so they can't go talk about it, not because it's really classified, but because it's baloney.
[03:00:48.965 --> 03:00:52.546]  Kind of like they're giving national security clearances right now to all the TSA workers.
[03:00:52.926 --> 03:01:01.568]  That's so they can keep secret really what they're doing and, you know, the abuse and so the TSA workers can't complain about, you know, being screwed around and things.
[03:01:02.468 --> 03:01:06.909]  Now that said, I'm not saying we couldn't start a war with Iran or the economy may not go into depression.
[03:01:07.349 --> 03:01:09.370]  It's just the feds are constantly running around.
[03:01:09.950 --> 03:01:16.194]  You know, telling people this is going to happen, that's going to happen, as a way to use crisis to get people to go along with them.
[03:01:16.494 --> 03:01:20.236]  So, I don't doubt that lady told Lindsey Williams that.
[03:01:20.676 --> 03:01:28.661]  I just have seen the Feds use, and they're not even Feds, you know, global manipulators, using stage crises to get people to go along with them.
[03:01:28.921 --> 03:01:29.982]  The crisis is here.
[03:01:30.002 --> 03:01:31.863]  You know, the tyranny is here.
[03:01:31.883 --> 03:01:32.924]  The looting is here.
[03:01:33.584 --> 03:01:34.605]  The depression is here.
[03:01:36.125 --> 03:01:38.106]  And so don't look for some big announcement to come.
[03:01:38.186 --> 03:01:40.446]  It's just going to be a slow slide into it.
[03:01:40.726 --> 03:01:42.506]  They may stage something down the road.
[03:01:42.847 --> 03:01:44.427]  Other key events, we know they do that.
[03:01:45.007 --> 03:01:48.068]  It's just generally when they tell you something's going to happen, it doesn't happen.
[03:01:49.048 --> 03:01:52.208]  When you can tell they're going to do something is when you see the preconditioning on the news.
[03:01:53.169 --> 03:01:54.069]  That's when you got to worry.
[03:01:54.289 --> 03:01:56.949]  And we are hurtling towards some major stage crises.
[03:01:57.549 --> 03:02:01.630]  I just don't know about, you know, getting ready for some, you know, huge implosion next week.
[03:02:01.950 --> 03:02:02.751]  That's a great question.
[03:02:03.191 --> 03:02:04.251]  Let's go ahead and go to you, sir.
[03:02:04.271 --> 03:02:04.671]  Go ahead.
[03:02:17.741 --> 03:02:17.981]  Sure.
[03:02:18.061 --> 03:02:19.902]  Comprehensive annual financial reports.
[03:02:20.162 --> 03:02:23.345]  I had Walter Burien on just a few months ago, one of the people exposing it.
[03:02:23.805 --> 03:02:28.429]  Anybody can just search their local county, city, school district, water district, power district.
[03:02:28.929 --> 03:02:30.831]  Comprehensive annual financial reports.
[03:02:31.911 --> 03:02:33.713]  When you hear about budgets in government,
[03:02:35.046 --> 03:02:38.389]  You're only hearing about the money that's actually being spent on local services.
[03:02:38.750 --> 03:02:44.816]  You're not hearing generally about two-thirds of the money being invested off the books.
[03:02:44.876 --> 03:02:47.258]  So it's like a mafia second set of books.
[03:02:49.398 --> 03:02:57.767]  Uh, governments have become fabulously wealthy and the private individuals, city managers and others that ran that would then be given payoffs and jobs later to go along with it.
[03:02:58.127 --> 03:03:10.721]  But through the derivative scam, the globalists have stolen most of that money and are now shutting down city governments or curtailing them and then putting them under pressure to follow federal guidelines or to get federal funds.
[03:03:11.221 --> 03:03:14.443]  Yeah, as much as I'd like to, Alex, I cannot listen to all your broadcasts.
[03:03:27.288 --> 03:03:35.976]  And so I may be repeating something, but one of the issues I would really love to see you cover more is the electronic voting machines.
[03:03:36.396 --> 03:03:40.519]  Because you get good candidates on, and people call in, and we just heard about Chalene.
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:50.308]  But unless you can really address who's counting the votes and how they're being counted, there's some great researchers out there, and I'd love to hear them on your show.
[03:03:51.072 --> 03:03:53.533]  Well, I've had Bev Harris on probably 30 times.
[03:03:53.934 --> 03:03:56.175]  I've missed it.
[03:03:56.615 --> 03:04:00.077]  But I go through guests in phases, and I do have a blind spot.
[03:04:00.357 --> 03:04:09.243]  When I've covered something 100 times, I tend to, like about a year or two ago, I realized, I haven't covered fluoride in a couple years, because I've probably done 100 shows on it.
[03:04:09.503 --> 03:04:12.885]  I better do it again, because the audience is a lot larger and more diverse.
[03:04:13.985 --> 03:04:17.768]  But there is a lot of electronic voting machine fraud.
[03:04:18.788 --> 03:04:35.033]  Uh, and they do use it in key races, and it's, Republicans are cheated, Democrats are cheated, it's mainly used to keep third party and alternative candidates out, and they've had major executives of these companies go public and say it's all a fraud and they die in plane crashes, or shoot themselves in the head.
[03:04:35.593 --> 03:04:39.294]  Uh, so, yeah, I mean, if they'll shoot up, you know, people in the U.S.
[03:04:39.354 --> 03:04:42.495]  and children in Guatemala with syphilis, and they'll radiate
[03:04:43.581 --> 03:04:45.808]  Foster kids to death in this country on record.
[03:04:45.888 --> 03:04:48.356]  I mean, of course they'll steal elections, but that's a great point.
[03:04:49.479 --> 03:04:49.841]  Thank you.
[03:04:50.001 --> 03:04:50.503]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:04:52.798 --> 03:05:07.808]  In the recent months on your show, you've talked about when we start and how much of the aviation and technology that is in the public domain is 30 to 40 years behind the state-of-the-art.
[03:05:08.008 --> 03:05:13.272]  Another individual who has examined this topic a greater deal is the tale of Dr. Stephen Greer.
[03:05:13.672 --> 03:05:21.698]  And my question is, what is the intersection of your research and Dr. Stephen Greer's regarding those advances in energy propulsion?
[03:05:24.219 --> 03:05:25.179]  Well, thank you.
[03:05:25.379 --> 03:05:27.320]  I should probably interview Dr. Stephen Greer.
[03:05:27.380 --> 03:05:27.660]  I haven't.
[03:05:27.720 --> 03:05:29.101]  I'm a little bit familiar with his work.
[03:05:29.761 --> 03:05:37.444]  I just know the government says that a plane in service in 1955, the SR-71 Blackbird, is the fastest aircraft we have.
[03:05:38.808 --> 03:05:43.330]  I know that they had the B-2 bomber for 20 years before they unveiled it.
[03:05:44.110 --> 03:05:50.332]  I know that the technology we're given is basically obsolete.
[03:05:52.152 --> 03:05:55.293]  A lot of people speculate and it gets into some wild stuff.
[03:05:55.633 --> 03:05:56.033]  I don't know.
[03:05:56.513 --> 03:06:03.395]  I mean, I can't get a lot of the public to admit that there's the Emergency Centers Act for FEMA camps for the American people.
[03:06:03.616 --> 03:06:04.596]  I mean, it's on record.
[03:06:05.336 --> 03:06:10.428]  It's mainstream news, FEMA camps, and I can't get people to admit that.
[03:06:11.029 --> 03:06:14.437]  So I don't really get off into speculation about
[03:06:15.752 --> 03:06:17.933]  Exactly what all this advanced technology is.
[03:06:18.393 --> 03:06:27.876]  I just know top globalist thinkers write books and chortle about it all and talk about all the things they're given, you know, that they're privy to, but then they don't basically tell us.
[03:06:28.536 --> 03:06:32.997]  My issue is a lot is going on we don't know about and we need to know about that.
[03:06:33.037 --> 03:06:37.859]  We need to start finding out about that and have more people leak information concerning that.
[03:06:37.899 --> 03:06:38.499]  But there have been
[03:06:39.140 --> 03:06:45.954]  Hundreds of trillions of dollars in the last 67 years in the aggregate stolen as part of black budget programs.
[03:06:46.435 --> 03:06:48.179]  I mean, hammers are not costing $700 at the Pentagon.
[03:06:49.946 --> 03:06:50.166]  Yeah.
[03:06:50.486 --> 03:06:51.847]  All that money's not being stolen.
[03:06:51.947 --> 03:06:55.728]  It's being put into secret programs, like the Underground Base Program and other things we know exist.
[03:06:56.208 --> 03:06:57.689]  All right, we've got about 15 minutes left.
[03:06:57.709 --> 03:06:59.209]  Let's accelerate through your great questions.
[03:06:59.249 --> 03:07:00.229]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:07:11.133 --> 03:07:16.555]  They owned it all, including you, by virtue of toxic currency, which was written by Ronald McDonald.
[03:07:16.595 --> 03:07:17.136]  Not the hamburger.
[03:07:17.936 --> 03:07:20.097]  Ronald McDonald and Dr. Robert Brogan.
[03:07:20.117 --> 03:07:23.458]  I would love to actually hear you have them on as guests.
[03:07:23.878 --> 03:07:27.040]  I did give a copy of the book to Ted Anderson earlier for you.
[03:07:27.060 --> 03:07:29.180]  I would hope that you could please take a look at it.
[03:07:29.461 --> 03:07:34.182]  Well, I would love to meet Ronald McDonald, so... He doesn't dress in the hamburger suit.
[03:07:34.222 --> 03:07:35.003]  He's a real person.
[03:07:36.670 --> 03:07:42.454]  Hey, I know they own it all, including us, but I'm telling them they may have gotten it through fraud, but they don't own me.
[03:07:49.159 --> 03:07:50.139]  There's a gremlin here.
[03:07:51.120 --> 03:07:58.685]  Hey, I talk bad about Ronald McDonald, and look at what happened.
[03:07:58.745 --> 03:08:01.567]  Ronald McDonald in the sky, running satellites.
[03:08:02.830 --> 03:08:04.071]  No, it sounds interesting, sir.
[03:08:04.111 --> 03:08:05.032]  It sounds interesting.
[03:08:05.632 --> 03:08:06.012]  Go ahead.
[03:08:06.032 --> 03:08:11.616]  I just want to say, I drove six hours to come see you.
[03:08:11.636 --> 03:08:17.461]  It's the first time I've ever seen you live.
[03:08:17.501 --> 03:08:18.481]  That's really nice.
[03:08:18.541 --> 03:08:18.862]  Thank you.
[03:08:18.882 --> 03:08:19.482]  Thank you.
[03:08:19.562 --> 03:08:26.087]  I don't get to please the CEO, but you know, I have an iPhone, and it's the best free thing on that planet for me.
[03:08:26.267 --> 03:08:27.688]  So great job, you making that one.
[03:08:27.768 --> 03:08:29.690]  And the fact that I was over here for $10.86, thank you.
[03:08:32.705 --> 03:08:36.066]  Well, I'll tell you why KSCO is so good.
[03:08:36.787 --> 03:08:45.711]  It's an independent station owned by an independent guy, Michael Zwirling, who when he was in high school was on the radio station.
[03:08:46.171 --> 03:08:53.234]  It's one of the only stations in the country, I just got a tour of it, actually built according to RCA specifications to be a real radio studio.
[03:08:53.254 --> 03:08:55.775]  They used to stick radio stations in, something wasn't built for it.
[03:08:56.195 --> 03:08:57.336]  It's an amazing place.
[03:08:58.036 --> 03:08:59.417]  And it's privately owned.
[03:08:59.497 --> 03:09:00.418]  It's individually owned.
[03:09:00.458 --> 03:09:01.739]  It owns two radio stations.
[03:09:02.120 --> 03:09:04.081]  And that's what America needs to get back to.
[03:09:04.321 --> 03:09:06.503]  Not two or three giant corporations owning it.
[03:09:07.764 --> 03:09:14.250]  More radio stations would be like KSCO if we didn't have these big transnationals owning it and controlling it.
[03:09:14.490 --> 03:09:15.971]  The airwaves do belong to the people.
[03:09:16.311 --> 03:09:17.532]  And I believe in private property.
[03:09:17.552 --> 03:09:20.195]  And I believe in individuals owning groups of stations.
[03:09:24.111 --> 03:09:29.317]  I'm the proud father of a one-year-old little girl, and I'm proud to say that I haven't given her one vaccine.
[03:09:30.058 --> 03:09:32.020]  I haven't vaccinated mine either, brother.
[03:09:34.964 --> 03:09:35.945]  And I found it in 1918.
[03:09:37.527 --> 03:09:41.171]  Now this question is for my mother-in-law, who's an avid listener of Alex Jones.
[03:09:42.361 --> 03:09:47.448]  I texted her giving the message earlier and I was drawn to blank so this is for her.
[03:09:48.109 --> 03:09:53.796]  Is there any protection against HAARP mind control and what can we do not to be controlled?
[03:09:54.677 --> 03:09:58.782]  Okay, HAARP is highly classified.
[03:10:00.516 --> 03:10:02.857]  I've actually had the director of HAARP on.
[03:10:02.877 --> 03:10:03.737]  It was like three years ago.
[03:10:03.757 --> 03:10:04.937]  I got a call from the Pentagon.
[03:10:05.598 --> 03:10:07.458]  The director of HAARP would like to come on your show.
[03:10:07.858 --> 03:10:09.899]  You just search Alex Jones interviews director of HAARP.
[03:10:10.459 --> 03:10:16.460]  And they had this Air Force colonel on during the breaks, telling him what he could and couldn't say.
[03:10:17.261 --> 03:10:21.322]  And I was like, well, you guys wanted to come on the show, and I still don't know why.
[03:10:25.573 --> 03:10:27.354]  But that was before Jesse went up there.
[03:10:27.975 --> 03:10:33.818]  But he starts talking about, we even ignite the atmosphere on fire some evenings.
[03:10:34.819 --> 03:10:38.541]  And they cut him off and it breaks, the colonel comes on and says, you can't get into that.
[03:10:39.162 --> 03:10:44.065]  As for mind control, DARPA that invented the internet wasn't Al Gore, folks.
[03:10:44.805 --> 03:10:45.466]  He's a fraud.
[03:10:46.246 --> 03:10:48.187]  It's admitted he didn't invent it, he's a lunatic.
[03:10:50.008 --> 03:10:50.689]  ManBearPig.
[03:10:52.881 --> 03:11:16.086]  But to make a long story short, DARPA, it had to be like a 99, it was in the Baltimore Sun, said, yes, because they put these trial balloons out, yes, we are testing antenna arrays in major cities during crises to calm the public.
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:22.184]  With these magnetic frequency systems they've tested on rodents and other things, that's all patented.
[03:11:22.604 --> 03:11:28.329]  So you do have stuff in the literature by them where they talk about how they're going to help us.
[03:11:29.149 --> 03:11:31.151]  We're already in so much frequency pollution.
[03:11:31.371 --> 03:11:32.472]  That's the great thing about humans.
[03:11:32.852 --> 03:11:37.276]  If you think cockroaches become immune to poison in a couple generations, worry about us.
[03:11:38.296 --> 03:11:41.058]  I think we're a lot tougher than the mighty cockroach.
[03:11:44.906 --> 03:11:50.149]  And when you're aware that you're powerful, it doesn't matter how much mind control there is, you're going to beat it.
[03:11:50.169 --> 03:11:50.249]  Okay?
[03:11:50.269 --> 03:11:52.811]  Because the globalists have got to live in this system they've created themselves.
[03:11:53.451 --> 03:11:58.774]  So, yeah, there is a lot of frequency manipulation going on, and a lot of it is admitted.
[03:11:59.754 --> 03:12:04.176]  And I've seen a lot of stuff about HAARP, you know, up in Alaska, engaging mind control.
[03:12:04.196 --> 03:12:09.399]  And I think it's more of a weather modification slash over-the-horizon radar system.
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:12.841]  But HAARP is only one of many arrays, and it's a really good question.
[03:12:15.180 --> 03:12:15.300]  Hey!
[03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:16.741]  That was in my speech!
[03:12:17.062 --> 03:12:18.363]  I never got to it!
[03:12:18.443 --> 03:12:20.464]  That was in my speech!
[03:12:20.685 --> 03:12:23.547]  I never got to it!
[03:12:44.028 --> 03:12:45.990]  You know, I still never got to these four pages.
[03:12:46.010 --> 03:12:48.152]  This is something I skipped on the front page.
[03:12:49.814 --> 03:12:51.396]  We helped the system enslave us.
[03:12:51.916 --> 03:12:57.522]  Smart house, smart cars, smart meters, threat fusion centers, rental car place.
[03:12:59.085 --> 03:12:59.725]  I don't
[03:13:19.983 --> 03:13:22.427]  It's like 11 o'clock at night, but it's 5 a.m.
[03:13:22.487 --> 03:13:23.088]  my time.
[03:13:23.628 --> 03:13:24.590]  So it's like 1 a.m.
[03:13:24.650 --> 03:13:25.731]  my time, Austin time.
[03:13:26.032 --> 03:13:28.576]  I still got to drive up to Bohemian Grove.
[03:13:36.346 --> 03:13:37.687]  I narrowly made it here.
[03:13:38.828 --> 03:13:43.772]  Okay, the other people got arrested, and I can't talk about it right now.
[03:13:44.292 --> 03:13:48.155]  But the point is, the point is, the point is, I have my reasons.
[03:13:48.175 --> 03:13:52.078]  The point is, I was like an aqua man in the river getting away.
[03:13:52.198 --> 03:13:58.443]  Anyway, that was a frog man getting out of there.
[03:13:58.483 --> 03:14:01.425]  But anyways, finishing the story so folks can go home.
[03:14:04.884 --> 03:14:12.049]  I come up to the counter, because we're getting into smart mirrors and smart houses, and there's this nice 20-year-old, you know, lady behind the counter.
[03:14:12.549 --> 03:14:15.211]  But she's really into how she's been trained in this corporate system.
[03:14:15.231 --> 03:14:17.572]  And I watch about five people in front of me getting around cars.
[03:14:17.752 --> 03:14:18.673]  They're all exhausted.
[03:14:18.733 --> 03:14:19.653]  Family's going up.
[03:14:20.034 --> 03:14:21.114]  One group had kids with them.
[03:14:21.555 --> 03:14:22.595]  And she's like, Hi!
[03:14:22.795 --> 03:14:22.915]  Oh!
[03:14:23.476 --> 03:14:24.236]  And she's getting their stuff.
[03:14:24.256 --> 03:14:25.277]  She's like, Where you going?
[03:14:25.317 --> 03:14:26.077]  What you doing?
[03:14:28.119 --> 03:14:28.759]  She's asking me.
[03:14:28.799 --> 03:14:31.221]  Of course, I know under Patriot Act compliance,
[03:14:32.577 --> 03:14:37.042]  That it's school teachers, not just cops, rental car places, banks.
[03:14:37.642 --> 03:14:39.304]  They're all trained to spy on you.
[03:14:39.804 --> 03:14:42.948]  When you go to have a baby at the hospital, they say, you got enough money?
[03:14:46.254 --> 03:14:47.694]  They don't tell you they're putting it all in a database.
[03:14:47.774 --> 03:14:53.216]  I mean, you know, the cops gotta tell you you have a right to remain silent, anything you can and say will be used against you in a court of law.
[03:14:53.576 --> 03:14:56.077]  Not all the little Stasi spies they hire.
[03:14:56.497 --> 03:15:06.020]  And they, I've found, you know, a lot of cops get on power trips out of control, but they're nothing, because they're held to a higher standard compared to the general public when they give them these little Nazi powers.
[03:15:06.780 --> 03:15:11.602]  And so I'm there at Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and she's sitting there, and I walk up,
[03:15:12.506 --> 03:15:20.553]  And I'm getting our rental car, and she starts asking me questions, and I just said, look, I know you're trained to ask all these questions to identify threats.
[03:15:21.154 --> 03:15:22.775]  Do you really think I'm a threat?
[03:15:23.275 --> 03:15:25.057]  And I said, listen, dear.
[03:15:25.838 --> 03:15:28.760]  I said, well, I kind of just shut up.
[03:15:28.780 --> 03:15:29.901]  I didn't say very much to her.
[03:15:30.202 --> 03:15:35.706]  I just, I, in fact, I was thinking of all the things I wanted to say to her, but I just, I just, I just shut up.
[03:15:36.127 --> 03:15:37.788]  And I said, and then,
[03:15:39.420 --> 03:15:40.942]  She wanted to let me know she was the boss.
[03:15:41.342 --> 03:15:48.210]  I went to all this trouble to get another address of where I live on my driver's license.
[03:15:49.111 --> 03:15:51.313]  And it's a real address I have, but it's not where I live.
[03:15:52.214 --> 03:15:53.375]  And she giggled and said,
[03:15:54.611 --> 03:15:58.252]  And she read out my address that no one has and there's no databases.
[03:15:58.752 --> 03:16:00.933]  And I said, oh, you've got the address?
[03:16:00.953 --> 03:16:02.433]  She said, yeah, I just wanted you to know.
[03:16:02.473 --> 03:16:03.413]  And she laughed at me.
[03:16:04.093 --> 03:16:05.994]  See, she's got power.
[03:16:06.814 --> 03:16:08.075]  She knows where I live.
[03:16:08.635 --> 03:16:09.655]  She knows where I really live.
[03:16:09.795 --> 03:16:13.896]  It doesn't matter to her if people call up and threaten to murder my children and cut my wife's head off.
[03:16:14.676 --> 03:16:15.636]  It doesn't matter to her.
[03:16:15.877 --> 03:16:17.057]  She's a little Nazi.
[03:16:18.212 --> 03:16:20.013]  And she'll end up like Nazis at Nuremberg.
[03:16:20.733 --> 03:16:24.815]  Even if she doesn't get in trouble for what she's done, she'll be hurt by the system she's serving.
[03:16:25.035 --> 03:16:27.816]  But she wanted me to know, because I got a little uppity with her.
[03:16:28.136 --> 03:16:29.676]  I said, I know you're doing this for database.
[03:16:30.056 --> 03:16:31.757]  And she said, yeah, I got your real address.
[03:16:33.978 --> 03:16:35.479]  Now, that's the data mining.
[03:16:36.219 --> 03:16:40.040]  The rental car people and the banks have more in their computers than the cops do.
[03:16:41.021 --> 03:16:41.361]  Okay?
[03:16:41.761 --> 03:16:42.481]  You understand that?
[03:16:42.521 --> 03:16:47.203]  And they're training them all to spy on you, but they're the head of Al Qaeda that gets to die at the Pentagon.
[03:16:50.831 --> 03:16:53.292]  All of us know it, and I'm sick and tired of it.
[03:16:53.612 --> 03:17:00.974]  And now, I remember tweeting 12 years ago about how all the new appliances in the future, now it's happening, will be controlled.
[03:17:01.254 --> 03:17:07.456]  Your thermostat, your refrigerator, your washing machines, all the new systems have these checks.
[03:17:07.576 --> 03:17:08.357]  It's controlled.
[03:17:08.597 --> 03:17:12.638]  And on wireless systems outside, the government controls what's happening in your house.
[03:17:13.058 --> 03:17:16.539]  And already, in California and other areas, it's happening.
[03:17:16.779 --> 03:17:19.000]  They showed up a year ago at my office and said,
[03:17:20.333 --> 03:17:21.414]  Oh, we'll put the smart meter in.
[03:17:21.454 --> 03:17:22.074]  You don't have a choice.
[03:17:22.194 --> 03:17:23.575]  And I have to know the rules.
[03:17:23.835 --> 03:17:25.576]  And I said, I opt out of it.
[03:17:25.796 --> 03:17:27.277]  And they got real mad.
[03:17:27.977 --> 03:17:31.639]  So see, they just show up and do this where everything in your house is being tracked.
[03:17:31.739 --> 03:17:35.521]  I remember four years ago, Google came out with a press release of stockholders.
[03:17:36.001 --> 03:17:38.183]  So much is in those stockholder reports.
[03:17:38.563 --> 03:17:40.124]  It's public, but it's not on the news.
[03:17:40.484 --> 03:17:42.005]  It's quasi-secret.
[03:17:42.725 --> 03:17:44.046]  And it was, we have a great new system.
[03:17:44.086 --> 03:17:47.087]  We're listening to everyone in their homes, off the microphones in their computers.
[03:17:47.147 --> 03:17:47.668]  It's just public.
[03:17:48.554 --> 03:17:52.665]  And we now have video cameras in most of the computers and we're watching them.
[03:17:52.986 --> 03:17:55.734]  But don't worry, it's around privacy rules because...
[03:17:56.345 --> 03:18:08.188]  Because we have a computer doing keywords, and if we hear a dog bark, we then sell the data that they have a dog, and they get dog food commercials on the computer, and on their TV, and you know, mail it to them.
[03:18:08.328 --> 03:18:10.709]  And TiVo's watching you, and what you're doing.
[03:18:10.729 --> 03:18:15.150]  Remember six years ago, Janet Jackson's breasts popped out, and they had it in the Chicago Tribune?
[03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:15.690]  Oh!
[03:18:16.010 --> 03:18:18.931]  Record relines and replays on TiVo!
[03:18:19.091 --> 03:18:19.491]  2.2 million!
[03:18:20.371 --> 03:18:22.692]  So, so, it's worse than 1984.
[03:18:23.072 --> 03:18:23.772]  Your computers,
[03:18:24.827 --> 03:18:26.310]  The camera is on your computer.
[03:18:26.330 --> 03:18:28.554]  Remember six months ago in Philadelphia?
[03:18:37.113 --> 03:18:37.513]  Remember?
[03:18:37.953 --> 03:18:40.354]  Oh, the school gave free laptops to the kids.
[03:18:40.394 --> 03:18:40.994]  That's a lie.
[03:18:41.054 --> 03:18:42.255]  You paid for them with tax money.
[03:18:42.755 --> 03:18:48.457]  And 50-something thousand images and videos were shot of the children disrobing, robing in their beds.
[03:18:48.477 --> 03:18:50.918]  And they even released photos of children sleeping at home.
[03:18:51.478 --> 03:18:52.919]  And there they were.
[03:18:52.939 --> 03:18:54.499]  You've never seen this on the news.
[03:18:54.899 --> 03:18:57.940]  The school watching the parents and watching the kids.
[03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:00.001]  And the school was all there.
[03:19:00.021 --> 03:19:01.001]  How did the school get caught?
[03:19:01.382 --> 03:19:05.423]  The school thought it was so normal they had a TV station in to show them.
[03:19:06.092 --> 03:19:07.679]  Oh look, we're watching people at their home!
[03:19:08.141 --> 03:19:11.133]  And a few parents weren't mind-controlled and said that isn't freedom!
[03:19:12.952 --> 03:19:13.693]  He's all watching you.
[03:19:13.893 --> 03:19:17.936]  The government is a narcotics, trafficking, murdering, criminal organization.
[03:19:18.316 --> 03:19:20.758]  Is the average low-level person that works for the government bad?
[03:19:20.838 --> 03:19:21.878]  No, they're just like you.
[03:19:22.219 --> 03:19:24.500]  But this is an example of how deep it really is.
[03:19:24.580 --> 03:19:25.181]  And look at this.
[03:19:25.401 --> 03:19:30.264]  We've just got like 50 people here that want to ask questions and I've got to get out of here, don't I?
[03:19:30.685 --> 03:19:33.106]  Should I shut this down or how long should I go?
[03:19:33.147 --> 03:19:35.028]  They're kicking us out.
[03:19:40.738 --> 03:19:45.722]  Well, if the coconut grove comes and tells me I can do some more, I'll do it.
[03:19:45.762 --> 03:19:46.122]  I'll do it.
[03:19:46.262 --> 03:19:46.963]  I tell you what!
[03:19:46.983 --> 03:19:52.587]  Don't be the government!
[03:19:52.607 --> 03:19:56.650]  Don't be the government?
[03:19:56.730 --> 03:19:59.272]  I'm about to be thrown out of here.
[03:19:59.713 --> 03:20:05.597]  You know what?
[03:20:05.657 --> 03:20:07.018]  It's been an amazing event.
[03:20:11.443 --> 03:20:16.670]  It's been amazing.
[03:20:16.810 --> 03:20:18.072]  I apologize.
[03:20:29.976 --> 03:20:32.037]  I want to thank you all.
[03:20:32.277 --> 03:20:37.701]  We are all together for liberty and freedom, and you're awesome.
[03:20:37.841 --> 03:20:41.203]  And I want to thank KSCO, Michael Zwirling.
[03:20:41.584 --> 03:20:44.806]  I want to thank everybody who came out tonight.
[03:20:44.826 --> 03:20:48.749]  I want to thank the facility, and we'll see you here for the World Show at 9.
[03:20:49.209 --> 03:20:51.551]  We'll do our best to make it sound like that.
[03:20:51.611 --> 03:20:52.691]  God bless you all.
[03:20:52.711 --> 03:20:53.252]  You're awesome.
[03:20:53.352 --> 03:20:53.552]  Thank you.
