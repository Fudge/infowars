[00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:20.077]  Yes, they're there drinking their finest champagne and gobbling caviar, having a big eugenics summit, dealing with world forced inoculations, cutting off power supplies, stopping mobility.
[00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:25.561]  We're going to be talking with Charlie Skelton of the London Guardian.
[00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:31.804]  He's also written for the Evening Standard and reports for BBC One.
[00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:34.566]  The list goes on and on.
[00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:44.340]  And just now, after he's filed his London Guardian report, he can now spill his guts about what he has witnessed.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:56.844]  And he told me he is going to spill his guts, but even more will be in the new report he's filing today and another tomorrow, and then of course some next week after the World Government Conference elapses Sunday morning.
[00:00:57.544 --> 00:01:05.427]  But before I go any further, I want to thank one of our sponsors, EcolaBlue.com, the atmospheric water generator in high demand, folks.
[00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:08.508]  They sell out quite often, so get your order in.
[00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:12.650]  It grabs water out of the atmosphere, the purest, cleanest water you can get.
[00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.990]  Ecolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.311]  They have a special running from Thursday, June 3rd.
[00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:26.375]  Until Sunday, June 6th.
[00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:27.235]  Love operators there.
[00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:29.977]  12 months of filters with all of the Acola Blue units.
[00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:33.218]  That's a multi-hundred dollar value discount.
[00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:37.160]  So tell them Alex sent you when you put in the product code at acolablue.com or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.801]  And lastly, we're not funded by the Ford Foundation or the media or the government.
[00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:57.088]  We are funded and supported by you, the listeners of this radio slash TV transmission.
[00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.951]  And you can see all of my films in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:08.192]  You can download other films that have been authorized to post there, like Camp FEMA.
[00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:10.854]  That is going up Monday.
[00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:12.355]  We've been a little bit behind posting that.
[00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:26.047]  We posted, of course, Don't Try It On Me two weeks ago, the police state for the rise of FEMA, Invisible Empire, No Order Defined, and the live simulcast of the radio show, a higher bitrate podcast.
[00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:32.592]  But more than that, your $5.95 a month funds so much of what we do here, so I want to thank all of the
[00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:38.798]  PrisonPlanet.tv members who have been members over the years, six plus years up and running.
[00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:45.184]  We're adding a lot of new features as you've noticed to the sites and making it even more easy to navigate.
[00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:46.785]  There's just so much media there.
[00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:49.968]  I don't know if we've even updated those subsections that have old media in them.
[00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:51.689]  You've got to actually log in to see all the new stuff.
[00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.691]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:58.275]  You can also go to InfoWars.com, the secure online video bookstore.
[00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:01.958]  And order films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:11.584]  I travel to Bilderberg, I confront them, I get in their face, I bullhorn them, and you're about to hear about their fear four years later concerning this from a Guardian reporter.
[00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:18.068]  We show their own documents, their own statements about a planetary regime to cut off resources so they can control us.
[00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.990]  Poverty is the greatest control tool.
[00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:26.213]  This film is the most essential of my 20-plus documentaries.
[00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:28.134]  Available at Infowars.com.
[00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.276]  You can also get Invisible Empire.
[00:03:31.817 --> 00:03:35.099]  That's kind of an updated version of this with the overall world government.
[00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:36.100]  Uh, program.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.821]  Uh, that's one of our newest films.
[00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:40.042]  Again, all available at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:41.824]  You can also write to us, P.O.
[00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:42.044]  Box 19549.
[00:03:42.424 --> 00:03:43.725]  That's P.O.
[00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:48.489]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-6-0.
[00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:51.311]  And, uh, get the DVDs and films that way.
[00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:56.895]  And we've got combos where some of the films are as low as $5 a piece, like Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:58.476]  In fact, you can get it for $5 by itself.
[00:04:00.077 --> 00:04:01.157]  And again, I want to thank you.
[00:04:01.177 --> 00:04:10.840]  We couldn't pay for the servers, the webmasters, the camera people, the engineers, the plane tickets, all of it without you.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.382]  We've done something really special here and I want to commend you and thank you and all of our sponsors that have also made it possible.
[00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:20.123]  So be sure and continue to support if you want to see this work continue and expand.
[00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:23.332]  Okay, shifting gears back into Charlie Skelton.
[00:04:23.873 --> 00:04:24.713]  Here are the headlines.
[00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:28.997]  We've got one by Paul Joseph Watson today.
[00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:31.919]  This is being reported by the major French news at a press conference.
[00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.423]  He snuck into Spain, got caught there, and now admits that eugenicist Bill Gates to attend 2010 Bilderberg Conference.
[00:04:39.024 --> 00:04:42.887]  But the really big news, because it shows how scared they are internally.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:55.965]  And it shows, this mirrors what Zbigniew Brzezinski said three weeks ago in Canada when he said, for the first time, the whole world is awake to world government and not just our puppet politicians, but the actual power structure.
[00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:57.006]  We're in trouble.
[00:04:57.526 --> 00:04:59.006]  People said, well, he's playing possum.
[00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:00.347]  No, he's not playing possum.
[00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:05.249]  And so Bilderberg see people with income as threat to their agenda.
[00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.912]  This was filed in part two of his London Guardian report, Bilderberg 2010, the security lockdown, Charlie Skelton.
[00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:14.513]  And he joins us.
[00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:17.834]  He can now tell us the day he was kicked out, Wednesday, before it started.
[00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:19.335]  Always key intel.
[00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:21.456]  What security people did to him and his wife.
[00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.457]  What he overheard them saying.
[00:05:23.777 --> 00:05:26.238]  And then he can tell us what happened yesterday and today.
[00:05:26.578 --> 00:05:28.459]  Charlie Skelton, thank you for joining us, sir.
[00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.140]  Hello, lovely to be back.
[00:05:30.612 --> 00:05:31.152]  Good to have you.
[00:05:31.192 --> 00:05:32.312]  So, you've got the floor.
[00:05:32.773 --> 00:05:37.374]  You can now, since you've filed your reports, tell us, because, you know, it's good to give them the scoop first.
[00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:38.314]  They pay to send you there.
[00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:38.914]  You work for them.
[00:05:39.594 --> 00:05:47.216]  Tell us the incredible, what you witnessed inside, sneaking about, spying on them, before they kicked you out, and then what's happened since then.
[00:05:47.596 --> 00:05:53.457]  Yeah, well, first of all, to talk about what you mentioned, we sat ourselves at dinner.
[00:05:53.477 --> 00:05:57.578]  This is a couple of days before the, in fact, the night before lockdown.
[00:05:57.678 --> 00:05:59.839]  So, whatever night that would have been, Tuesday night.
[00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:10.169]  And we sat next to some of the conference organisers because what people have to remember is that this is, apart from anything else, it's a big conference.
[00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:19.856]  So there's a large team of extremely well-oiled conference organisers who run the whole show every year, at least the core team members do, and they were having their dinner.
[00:06:19.916 --> 00:06:27.962]  So we sat ourselves down nice and innocently next to their table and we just sat and pretended to have a conversation all night whilst listening.
[00:06:28.062 --> 00:06:29.803]  So yeah, we did a little bit of ear-wigging.
[00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:41.907]  And one of the things that we heard that was most astonishing was the discussion that took place about you and about your presence at Bilderberg with your bullhorn.
[00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.448]  And they started saying, you know, they said, you've seen the videos from that year.
[00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:46.108]  This is a quote.
[00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:47.189]  You've seen the videos from that year.
[00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.549]  They were very close to the hotel.
[00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.450]  And the person looked in absolute terror and said, but did they ever try to attack?
[00:06:54.511 --> 00:06:58.072]  And the person looked back equally fearful and said, no, no, but it was scary.
[00:06:58.112 --> 00:06:59.012]  It was very scary.
[00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:06.733]  There was a demonstration at the walls and you know did they ever try to attack and they were asking this absolutely seriously.
[00:07:07.053 --> 00:07:25.670]  They were having this discussion and you know I'm here now with with looking I'm here with people and the people who are standing here at the roundabout much as you did before and you know they're saying that they're saying their slogans and they're holding their banners and there's an awful lot of there's a little bit of anger towards the people up the hill but generally speaking there's a lot of love towards
[00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.031]  Thank you very much.
[00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:37.121]  I don't
[00:07:59.443 --> 00:08:18.013]  The concerned, interested citizen who is standing out here, who has travelled to whatever part of the world Bilderberg happens to be in, and is holding their flag, and is chanting their chant, and they see these people as the enemy, and what they don't understand is that these people who are standing out here chanting, they are the true friends of humanity.
[00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:21.474]  Well, that's the point you make in your well-written article.
[00:08:21.554 --> 00:08:27.782]  And I want to remind listeners, we contacted you last year, hearing that The Guardian was going to send a reporter.
[00:08:27.802 --> 00:08:29.924]  There was a big announcement in the paper that was promoting it.
[00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:34.430]  We contacted you, and you were like, oh, I kind of thought it was a joke.
[00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.090]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:37.802 --> 00:08:52.120]  Reporter who they thought would really you know be balanced because you thought it was a joke and then once you got there And they harassed you and arrested you you know and now you've had this conversion of Realizing, but you you have some quotes here in your article.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.404]  He says It says although quite
[00:08:58.494 --> 00:09:03.499]  Why attending Bilderberg has to remain such a mystery remains a mystery.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.984]  The blackened windows, the limousines, the desperate camera dodging of the delegates.
[00:09:08.344 --> 00:09:12.088]  The paranoia was riding high amongst the conference organizers.
[00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:19.536]  A pair of them talked about 2006 Bilderberg conference in Ottawa where the radio host Alex Jones led the protest with his megaphone.
[00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:21.218]  They were very close to the hotel.
[00:09:21.778 --> 00:09:24.540]  You're quoted as them saying, said one.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.562]  Another looked shocked and said, did they ever try to attack?
[00:09:28.022 --> 00:09:31.745]  A shake of the head and the answer, no, but it was very scary.
[00:09:32.245 --> 00:09:33.166]  A third leaned in.
[00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:35.807]  This is the negative side of the welfare state.
[00:09:36.148 --> 00:09:39.410]  People have enough income so they can do this.
[00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.851]  It's like a permanent threat.
[00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:51.018]  And see, from what I've read by the phony environmentalist and the globalist, they want to shut the economy down, only allow authorized, permitted travel.
[00:09:51.878 --> 00:10:10.312]  For government-approved reasons, they want a local environmental boss that controls every facet of your life, has nothing to do with environment, it's prison, and they say they want a post-industrial world to control us so that we literally only live and work in one town and maybe get to travel once in our lives.
[00:10:10.372 --> 00:10:11.653]  This is the policy.
[00:10:12.814 --> 00:10:13.675]  So what you heard
[00:10:15.645 --> 00:10:35.482]  uh... was a major window into the mindset and they see us as the enemy because they have a predatory view on us and so they subconsciously expect us uh... to hate them and dislike them and finishing up your eloquent uh... uh... writing here uh... you went on to make the point that
[00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:44.916]  That no, this is humanity upset about being slaves, upset about being looted, upset about their elected leaders meeting in secret with the big owners.
[00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:46.117]  In fact, you said, what threat?
[00:10:46.538 --> 00:10:51.626]  The people concerned about this unfairness of the world should drape a banner over a police cordon?
[00:10:52.166 --> 00:11:00.250]  That they should shout their anger at the madness of asset-grabbing transnational corporations whose chairman are sipping beers with our elected officials.
[00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:02.091]  It's like a permanent threat.
[00:11:02.232 --> 00:11:03.292]  Don't make me spit.
[00:11:03.732 --> 00:11:05.914]  And then it talks about them basically harassing you and your wife.
[00:11:05.954 --> 00:11:06.514]  Please continue.
[00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:10.384]  Yeah, I mean, let's be clear about who is saying this.
[00:11:10.484 --> 00:11:16.169]  This conversation is being had by people on the inner core of the Bilderberg conference organization.
[00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:18.492]  So they're the Bilderberg group people.
[00:11:18.732 --> 00:11:21.675]  They're the people in charge of Bilderberg.
[00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:28.361]  They're not the people at Bilderberg who are the participants, but they're very close to the ideology of Bilderberg.
[00:11:28.481 --> 00:11:29.542]  This is top minions.
[00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:30.343]  Top minions.
[00:11:30.383 --> 00:11:31.044]  Top minions, yeah.
[00:11:31.847 --> 00:11:37.015]  And, um, yeah, the, uh, we can, you can actually identify which level the minions are at by their lanyard colours.
[00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.139]  Uh, we've, uh, someone's pointed out that the, the delegates have got white.
[00:11:40.911 --> 00:11:41.671]  We're good to go.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.503]  There's all kinds of different police here.
[00:12:06.543 --> 00:12:12.669]  There's secret police, there's state police, there's riot police, there's also local police.
[00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:17.653]  There's the Mossos de Squadra, which is the local Catalonian police, I think.
[00:12:18.034 --> 00:12:23.119]  And a quote has come out today that just to have them, I mean they're just the very lowest,
[00:12:23.739 --> 00:12:25.281]  You know, of the police forces around.
[00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:28.424]  Just to have them is €150,000 per day.
[00:12:29.045 --> 00:12:31.688]  So the big question is, you know, who's picking up that tab?
[00:12:31.728 --> 00:12:32.889]  Is it the Spanish taxpayer?
[00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:34.110]  And if so, that's a disgrace.
[00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:43.740]  And if the Bilderberg conference is reimbursing the Spanish taxpayer, then basically they're using the local police as a private army.
[00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:46.003]  So either way, it's grotesquely unethical.
[00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:56.467]  And again, up until the last few years, almost no mainstream media coverage or zero, going back a decade and before, so they are not happy.
[00:12:56.988 --> 00:13:10.997]  What do you make of the TV and radio, as well as multiple newspapers in Germany and Spain, reporting that Bill Gates flew into a fake conference when the media showed up it wasn't real, and he admitted, I'm really here for Bilderberg.
[00:13:11.237 --> 00:13:15.420]  I mean, they even put on a fake medical conference just for him to have a cover.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.401]  This is incredible.
[00:13:16.881 --> 00:13:21.966]  That is quite extraordinary, and you know, it's not just incredible, it's absolutely pathetic.
[00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:24.368]  I mean, that really is sad, isn't it?
[00:13:24.388 --> 00:13:38.741]  I mean, I find this whole, you know, zooming up the hill behind tinted windows, and swooping into the underground garage, and distractions, and do you remember when President Obama shook off his, well not, yeah, he shook off the whole, he wasn't president then.
[00:13:38.761 --> 00:13:39.962]  He was candidate Obama!
[00:13:40.442 --> 00:13:48.588]  Yeah, and he shook off the whole press corps, and Axelrod is standing on the plane going, I'm sorry, he's got to go attend some meetings, and the press are going... But we were there!
[00:13:48.608 --> 00:13:54.333]  The Secret Service drove in with three black vehicles, and they had submachine guns, and pointed them at us!
[00:13:54.733 --> 00:14:07.983]  And we have just a blur of the video, but we paused it, it's online, and you can see the submachine gun, and those guys are just like out of a movie, just... just red, because, you know, Hillary and him, and they're just candidates, and I'm out there going, the real leader in there!
[00:14:08.303 --> 00:14:16.587]  And here comes the two presidential candidates, and then we announced he was there that it had gone to Hillary from Tucker's sources, and boom, Hillary stood down.
[00:14:17.108 --> 00:14:24.251]  Again, they're picking our president, and I as a citizen get a machine gun pointed at me, but that's not scary.
[00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:25.912]  My bullhorn is scary.
[00:14:26.913 --> 00:14:27.473]  And it's good.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:38.778]  Yeah, no, they're scared and, you know, they should be scared because you look at the difference between Greece last year and Spain this year and the big difference, you know, physically it looks very similar.
[00:14:38.818 --> 00:14:40.200]  It's exactly the same kind of setup.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.703]  It's a high security
[00:14:42.552 --> 00:14:54.404]  Uh, Hotel Upper Hill, you know, and police, Mediterranean police surrounding it in vast numbers, and there's apparently, uh, there's, uh, it's been confirmed that there's, uh, military divers, uh, off the coast in a boat.
[00:14:54.424 --> 00:14:58.528]  You know, the whole thing is very much like last year, you know, when the Greek Navy intercepted...
[00:14:59.208 --> 00:14:59.969]  We're good to go.
[00:15:16.927 --> 00:15:30.598]  And in today, apparently there's a page in today's independent newspaper, that's British Broadsheet National Paper, you know, I think the Guardian are actually picking up another piece and putting it in the newspaper about just a more of a newsy kind of piece.
[00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:38.645]  And, you know, I was on Radio 4 talking, which is a major news, current affairs radio program called Today.
[00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:41.087]  No, it's worldwide and I can get it on my XM radio.
[00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:50.257]  That's what you're seeing there, New, there's Spanish newspapers, and apparently the only Spanish newspaper that hasn't really reported on it is the one owned by one of the guys up the hill.
[00:15:53.099 --> 00:15:55.660]  But, you know, it's very, very different.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:05.687]  There are more people here, and there are camera crews, and there are photographers, and there are news reporters, and there are documentary makers, and it feels totally different, and it really feels like a breakthrough.
[00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:11.854]  So the tide is turning against him, exactly as Zbigniew Brzezinski said three weeks ago.
[00:16:12.334 --> 00:16:21.076]  Other intel when you were inside and talking to other reporters... Before I go there, can I tell you about something else about the turning of the tide?
[00:16:21.276 --> 00:16:21.536]  Sure.
[00:16:21.857 --> 00:16:24.477]  Which is that, now this is, I've just literally been told it.
[00:16:25.338 --> 00:16:36.261]  Apparently there's going to be some footage coming up on YouTube somewhere, but the people who've been chanting their chant in Spanish on the roundabout here, they've been chanting to the police, they've been saying,
[00:16:36.781 --> 00:16:40.965]  Yeah, you have a heart behind your badge, you have a brain under your hat.
[00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:44.908]  After the football they've been chanting, after the football, we're the ones you'll be having a beer with.
[00:16:45.568 --> 00:16:49.211]  We're the ones you should be protecting and they kept saying this, you have a heart behind your badge.
[00:16:49.512 --> 00:17:00.561]  And apparently, this is, I've been told, one of the policemen took off his hat, turned to his colleagues and said, I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore, and walked across the street and joined the protesters.
[00:17:00.601 --> 00:17:04.544]  Now, apparently there's footage of that, but if that's the case, that right there is the power of
[00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.303]  You know, I sound like an idiot, but that's the power of truth and that's the power of information.
[00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:14.705]  We just played the video from YouTube of when they had the machine guns pointed out the windows at us.
[00:17:15.085 --> 00:17:17.586]  You can pause that later if you're watching this on the web and see it.
[00:17:17.926 --> 00:17:18.947]  But that's just from video.
[00:17:18.967 --> 00:17:21.828]  We have video stills online that are even crisper.
[00:17:22.348 --> 00:17:27.530]  And then they had Marines driving around with clown masks on, following us and harassing us.
[00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:33.212]  Again, it's all psychological, because we dare go and say, we don't want our president picked in secret.
[00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:35.533]  And the Marines are like, this is illegal!
[00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:36.574]  A citizen's
[00:17:37.854 --> 00:17:38.994]  Yeah, that's a good still right there.
[00:17:39.014 --> 00:17:43.175]  We can see him lifting the machine gun up, but there's another shot where it's pointed out.
[00:17:43.555 --> 00:17:46.916]  Mr. Skelton, stay with us for another five minutes in this segment, and then five more.
[00:17:47.216 --> 00:17:51.957]  Five minutes into the next hour, then we got Jim Tucker coming up later, Bob Chapman, and a lot more.
[00:17:52.457 --> 00:17:58.279]  I want to talk about more of what you saw inside the hotel as they threw you out, and what other reporters are telling you, what intel they're getting.
[00:17:58.659 --> 00:17:59.719]  But that's really exciting news.
[00:18:01.004 --> 00:18:02.245]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:02.285 --> 00:18:07.649]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.493]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:12.894 --> 00:18:17.978]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:18:18.478 --> 00:18:23.162]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:18:23.683 --> 00:18:30.628]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:18:30.808 --> 00:18:31.709]  And here's the best part.
[00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:38.313]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:18:38.613 --> 00:18:41.455]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:44.898]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:18:44.918 --> 00:18:45.138]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:18:52.822 --> 00:18:57.346]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:18:57.647 --> 00:19:00.109]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.591]  You worry.
[00:19:01.731 --> 00:19:03.813]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:19:04.093 --> 00:19:04.373]  Hi.
[00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:07.116]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:19:07.436 --> 00:19:11.660]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:14.143]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:19:14.443 --> 00:19:17.446]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:19:17.786 --> 00:19:18.387]  We're good to go.
[00:19:48.048 --> 00:19:49.713]  Call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:19:50.174 --> 00:19:50.816]  Start now.
[00:19:51.077 --> 00:19:52.040]  Knowledge is power.
[00:19:52.803 --> 00:19:53.625]  Better take action.
[00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:54.769]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:20:01.485 --> 00:20:04.407]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:06.428]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:20:06.548 --> 00:20:09.210]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.251]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:20:11.532 --> 00:20:12.712]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:20:12.932 --> 00:20:14.533]  But first, the facts.
[00:20:14.834 --> 00:20:16.555]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:20:16.775 --> 00:20:18.476]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:20:18.756 --> 00:20:22.238]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:20:22.439 --> 00:20:29.823]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:20:30.183 --> 00:20:30.804]  Sinofresh.

[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:52.780]  It works!
[00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:18.802]  Well, Charlie Skelton writes for major newspapers, including The Guardian.
[00:21:19.163 --> 00:21:27.267]  He's on assignment there, outside Barcelona in this resort area, at this luxury hotel outside of it.
[00:21:27.987 --> 00:21:33.250]  And he's got some major breaking news for us, confirming
[00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:41.532]  What he heard the highest-level Bilderberg staff of the club itself at dinner, and I wish you had a micro recorder, man, that'd be gold.
[00:21:42.413 --> 00:21:46.334]  But regardless, you're a reporter, so it's on the record, and that's good.
[00:21:46.714 --> 00:21:52.876]  But Tucker's saying, Tucker told you, this is big news, tell folks what Tucker told you.
[00:21:53.556 --> 00:22:03.119]  Well, this is confirmed, what Tucker said confirmed what we heard at dinner, and what we heard is that they were talking about the fact that there are fewer delegates this year turning up
[00:22:03.829 --> 00:22:04.389]  We're good to go.
[00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:21.323]  They don't want to be seen to be a Bilderberger.
[00:22:21.663 --> 00:22:23.544]  I mean, what on earth does that tell you about the meeting?
[00:22:23.624 --> 00:22:36.553]  And what does it tell you about the fact that, you know, the amount of guerrilla journalism and the amount of interest on the online community and, you know, what few journalists have been reporting about this, that kind of pressure is building and it's
[00:22:37.754 --> 00:22:43.857]  Turned into a situation which is untenable for people, some of the people, some of the delegates to come along.
[00:22:43.877 --> 00:22:44.977]  So they've turned it back.
[00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:46.098]  Well, what about 94?
[00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:56.403]  Hillary Clinton got a, going from memory, a $400,000 fine for violating the Logan Act as a, you know, in the White House.
[00:22:56.423 --> 00:22:59.664]  And then in 2006, we know Hillary was in Ottawa.
[00:22:59.684 --> 00:23:00.545]  She lied about it.
[00:23:01.085 --> 00:23:02.165]  And here came a U.S.
[00:23:02.185 --> 00:23:03.206]  diplomatic armored
[00:23:04.786 --> 00:23:21.091]  uh... limousine and they pulled into the underground parking garage and then it left a few hours later the letter we confirmed hillary was there show uh... i mean i mean it's just incredible and madeline albright in two thousand eight there's actually photos of this online that uh... activist shot i was told as you know
[00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:27.617]  We were all around the perimeter, bullhorning and yelling, and there were people, so it was a several square mile area, so I didn't see it, but I saw the photos.
[00:23:27.957 --> 00:23:44.592]  She drove in in a Volvo, and even though it was 200 yards in or so, because this place in Virginia had woods all around it, it was quite a park area around it, and they had police and others and Marines and plainclothes guarding it, that she ran in and panicked, and then ran back out.
[00:23:45.032 --> 00:23:46.434]  And there's photos of it.
[00:23:46.794 --> 00:23:52.360]  So, I mean, they are scared to death of the people because of the type of criminal stuff they're discussing in there.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.100]  They know.
[00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:54.742]  I mean, they're acting so guilty.
[00:23:55.303 --> 00:23:55.543]  I know.
[00:23:55.623 --> 00:23:57.445]  It's like Bilderberg has become a dirty word.
[00:23:58.186 --> 00:24:00.889]  And I don't... It's one of those questions.
[00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:03.872]  If it's not a bad thing, why not just go?
[00:24:03.892 --> 00:24:04.933]  I don't understand.
[00:24:05.689 --> 00:24:11.834]  You know, if it's just a thing that people are just having a nice chat or if they're strategizing for the good of the world, then great!
[00:24:12.275 --> 00:24:19.721]  Why not just have those strategy talks and why not just invite the press and maybe even ask a few intelligent people what they might think about it?
[00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.283]  Maybe ask the members of the press, maybe ask the members of the public.
[00:24:22.624 --> 00:24:27.848]  Let's talk about how to steer our humanity to a better place.
[00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:32.312]  But, you know, maybe that's not exactly what's being discussed.
[00:24:32.847 --> 00:24:37.369]  Now, you talk about being the last person in the hotel and then running you and your wife out with security.
[00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:40.990]  Describe some more of what happened inside as they closed the gates.
[00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:45.792]  Well, my wife is... She's got some nerves.
[00:24:45.832 --> 00:24:47.453]  I was much nervier than she was.
[00:24:47.493 --> 00:24:49.254]  She decided to just drag her heels.
[00:24:49.274 --> 00:24:50.534]  We were checking out.
[00:24:50.554 --> 00:24:52.275]  We were about an hour late checking out.
[00:24:52.295 --> 00:24:55.436]  They kept ringing the room and I was going, for goodness sake, we have to go.
[00:24:55.476 --> 00:24:56.757]  And she's going, no, no, this is fun.
[00:24:57.377 --> 00:25:01.298]  And she got to reception and then she said, do you mind?
[00:25:01.318 --> 00:25:02.399]  I've really got to print something out.
[00:25:03.397 --> 00:25:05.318]  I think so.
[00:25:20.342 --> 00:25:31.625]  Right in the middle of the engine of Bilderberg at a computer terminal and suddenly she's spotted and this extremely stern Dutch lady turns around and says, take her to security!
[00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:32.965]  Take her to security!
[00:25:33.645 --> 00:25:36.706]  You know, and they got pretty nasty with her.
[00:25:36.726 --> 00:25:39.027]  Remove this slave!
[00:25:40.963 --> 00:25:46.107]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:25:46.687 --> 00:25:50.030]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.711]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:25:52.752 --> 00:25:54.993]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:25:55.073 --> 00:25:57.855]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:25:58.275 --> 00:26:03.019]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:26:03.379 --> 00:26:07.562]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:26:07.882 --> 00:26:10.205]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:26:10.225 --> 00:26:12.749]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:15.672]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:23.643]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:26:23.962 --> 00:26:29.265]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:26:29.345 --> 00:26:31.646]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:26:31.666 --> 00:26:35.648]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:26:35.888 --> 00:26:36.789]  And I got news for you.
[00:26:36.969 --> 00:26:38.270]  You're everyone else.
[00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:39.290]  Invisible Empire.

[00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:26.413]  You get 150 of the most powerful people in the world meeting.
[00:27:26.993 --> 00:27:28.474]  Royalty, the heads of the Fortune 60.
[00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:33.500]  And they are scared to death of citizens, just like G20.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.783]  They'll have a public G20 meeting, and then behind the scenes the elite flies in and they meet in these hotel ballrooms.
[00:27:39.103 --> 00:27:46.426]  But Bilderberg is one of the oldest continual meetings of this committee of 300, and Charlie Skelton is finishing up his report to us.
[00:27:46.867 --> 00:27:52.109]  London Guardian reporter, we've got links on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to this event.
[00:27:52.589 --> 00:27:55.931]  So you were talking about the day they shut it down, you and your wife being the last people
[00:27:56.491 --> 00:28:02.493]  Uh, in the hotel, uh, you go into, you know, uh, to the nerve center where they're setting up computers and tables.
[00:28:02.533 --> 00:28:05.514]  I've witnessed this myself, being thrown out in Virginia when they met in 2008.
[00:28:05.874 --> 00:28:11.156]  And they start, you know, cause I had, I had all my camera guys split up and they were, get out of here!
[00:28:11.196 --> 00:28:11.756]  Who are you?
[00:28:11.796 --> 00:28:12.136]  Get him!
[00:28:12.176 --> 00:28:13.097]  Give me that camera!
[00:28:13.417 --> 00:28:16.618]  And then we basically got chased out of the hotel finally at the end.
[00:28:16.638 --> 00:28:22.520]  Uh, but, but, but finish up with the boldness of your, uh, of, uh, of a frown skeleton.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.221]  And then let's get into any other things that happened.
[00:28:25.646 --> 00:28:34.608]  Yeah, no, just when I was just saying that, you know, they had a go at her and they were, you know, they looked at her like a, you know, a slug had suddenly landed on their lettuce.
[00:28:35.208 --> 00:28:39.909]  And, you know, and my wife said, you know, this isn't a very friendly hotel.
[00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.810]  And this woman, you know, just said, no, it is not a friendly hotel.
[00:28:44.871 --> 00:28:46.351]  And they threw her out.
[00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:47.631]  And so we got lost.
[00:28:47.651 --> 00:28:49.912]  But before that had all happened, you know,
[00:28:50.999 --> 00:29:05.329]  She'd managed to creep behind, this was on the previous day, she was sitting behind the pool, some ladies who were running through the biography info of the various participants and she took some photos over their shoulder and it says exactly, I don't know if you know the scene from Rear Window when
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.601]  Uh, Jimmy Stewart's looking at... Yeah, Alfred Hitchcock!
[00:29:08.861 --> 00:29:23.865]  Yeah, yeah, and, uh, Grace Kelly's opposite the way, and then, and, you know, the guy's coming back, and I'm, I'm across the, across the pool and splashing about in the pool trying to make as much noise so that they don't hear the camera clicks, and she's, she's looking over the shoulder, and she got some good names, you know, and... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:29:24.085 --> 00:29:25.726]  Have you posted this on The Guardian yet?
[00:29:26.186 --> 00:29:28.027]  I, I posted the list of names I have, yes.
[00:29:28.287 --> 00:29:29.187]  I didn't post how we got it.
[00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:31.226]  Oh, so now you're telling us?
[00:29:31.487 --> 00:29:31.667]  Yeah.
[00:29:31.847 --> 00:29:32.889]  How about the photos?
[00:29:32.949 --> 00:29:34.911]  Because, you know, right now this is hot.
[00:29:35.032 --> 00:29:36.794]  Please get it on The Guardian immediately!
[00:29:36.814 --> 00:29:37.835]  Oh, please!
[00:29:38.256 --> 00:29:40.579]  Or... I can send you the photos.
[00:29:40.619 --> 00:29:41.901]  I mean, they're a bit blurry.
[00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:43.483]  We spent a long time deciphering it.
[00:29:43.523 --> 00:29:44.304]  No, that's okay.
[00:29:44.945 --> 00:29:45.125]  Listen...
[00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:53.011]  And anything you want posted that you think they don't have the nerve to do, because I know you're paying for a lot of this on your own, we are happy to post it.
[00:29:53.031 --> 00:29:55.533]  I know you're doing some stuff outside of The Guardian.
[00:29:55.973 --> 00:30:00.877]  I'm going to give you a key email coming up as we let you go here going into break to get this up.
[00:30:00.917 --> 00:30:02.077]  Charlie Skelton, you're amazing.
[00:30:02.358 --> 00:30:09.783]  And we're going to get you on Monday or Tuesday after you've gotten back home to the UK and had time to rest to kind of, you know, in the aftermath, give us your full view.
[00:30:09.823 --> 00:30:12.605]  But we are very thankful to you and your wife's courage.
[00:30:13.786 --> 00:30:16.188]  Any other Ted Bits that you've forgotten to tell us?
[00:30:17.189 --> 00:30:17.629]  Well, I'll tell you.
[00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:26.497]  There's a nice little human story, which is that they were sitting around at dinner and they were saying they had a bit of a problem because one of the participants demanded a smoking room.
[00:30:26.997 --> 00:30:28.899]  And they said, but it's a non-smoking hotel.
[00:30:28.939 --> 00:30:30.661]  And they were trying to work out how to get around this.
[00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:35.765]  And one of them pointed out that the smoking ban hasn't actually fully come in for the next few days.
[00:30:35.805 --> 00:30:37.026]  So they got under the wire.
[00:30:37.066 --> 00:30:39.268]  I think they're OK.
[00:30:39.308 --> 00:30:41.110]  But there's some human stories as well in all of this.
[00:30:42.111 --> 00:30:48.719]  Well that also shows how these globalists are obsessed with their own little neurotic rules when any normal person would just ignore the smoking ban.
[00:30:50.727 --> 00:30:52.168]  These are neurotic people.
[00:30:52.208 --> 00:30:52.929]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:30:53.449 --> 00:31:01.615]  No, no, I mean, I'm going to hopefully get some more on that story of the policeman who switched sides, which would be great.
[00:31:01.695 --> 00:31:04.337]  And generally speaking, the police have been good.
[00:31:04.357 --> 00:31:13.723]  And I'd like to say that, you know, they've picked a strange place to do this, Catalonia, where, you know, they're quite independent and they don't really like the Spanish overlords, never mind global overlords.
[00:31:13.763 --> 00:31:17.606]  So, you know, we're getting a lot of kind looks from the police and a lot of
[00:31:18.536 --> 00:31:21.978]  You know, when they're saying to us, you know, we're just doing our job, they give us a little...
[00:31:23.122 --> 00:31:30.687]  A little sort of roll of the eyes, because they really, a lot of them, and some of them have said outright, they're going, look, you know, off the record, I'm with you.
[00:31:30.707 --> 00:31:32.848]  I don't, I don't like the guys up the hill.
[00:31:33.209 --> 00:31:35.510]  But, you know, I'm, unfortunately, I have to do this.
[00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.632]  Charlie Skelton, just amazing, amazing.
[00:31:39.032 --> 00:31:44.495]  Bilderberg 2010, you're going to be following a new report today, tomorrow at The Guardian.
[00:31:44.896 --> 00:31:46.457]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:31:46.477 --> 00:31:49.739]  I'm going to put you on hold and give you the secret squirrel email.
[00:31:50.479 --> 00:31:55.242]  If you want to send us that information and any attributions you'd like, please add it.
[00:31:55.502 --> 00:31:57.904]  And we'll talk to you again coming up next week.
[00:31:58.264 --> 00:31:58.884]  God bless you.
[00:31:58.904 --> 00:32:00.585]  We'll be back with Bob Chapman.
[00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:03.587]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:04.008 --> 00:32:08.971]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.331 --> 00:32:11.072]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.392 --> 00:32:14.274]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[00:32:14.614 --> 00:32:16.175]  Food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.355 --> 00:32:17.335]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.555 --> 00:32:18.295]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.675 --> 00:32:20.276]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.556 --> 00:32:21.376]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.636 --> 00:32:23.697]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.837 --> 00:32:24.937]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:25.178 --> 00:32:26.518]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.698 --> 00:32:31.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.101]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.541 --> 00:32:39.043]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:39.363 --> 00:32:40.344]  How much will you need?
[00:32:40.584 --> 00:32:41.224]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.504 --> 00:32:42.405]  How much do you want?
[00:32:42.605 --> 00:32:43.325]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.525 --> 00:32:44.366]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:44.626 --> 00:32:47.387]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.688 --> 00:32:49.429]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:49.449 --> 00:32:50.369]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.983]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:05.844]  What have we got?
[00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.225]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:33:08.525 --> 00:33:09.246]  A republic.
[00:33:09.526 --> 00:33:12.107]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:33:12.188 --> 00:33:14.089]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:33:14.449 --> 00:33:16.350]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.751]  So they think they own our land?
[00:33:18.151 --> 00:33:19.272]  They think they own our water?
[00:33:19.472 --> 00:33:19.872]  Children?
[00:33:20.072 --> 00:33:20.873]  Our education?
[00:33:21.193 --> 00:33:21.813]  Our money?
[00:33:22.034 --> 00:33:25.676]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:33:26.036 --> 00:33:29.681]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:33:31.023 --> 00:33:31.844]  We have the facts.
[00:33:32.044 --> 00:33:33.146]  We have the Constitution.
[00:33:33.206 --> 00:33:34.087]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:33:34.107 --> 00:33:34.948]  We have common law.
[00:33:35.008 --> 00:33:37.251]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:37.512 --> 00:33:41.297]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:33:41.397 --> 00:33:46.180]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:33:46.361 --> 00:33:47.721]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:33:47.842 --> 00:33:48.702]  Don't tread on me.
[00:33:48.942 --> 00:33:55.807]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:33:59.895 --> 00:34:03.878]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:34:04.098 --> 00:34:10.143]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:34:10.523 --> 00:34:17.609]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:22.473]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:34:22.773 --> 00:34:24.915]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:34:27.717 --> 00:34:29.177]  It's powder and owner for over 63 years.
[00:34:29.198 --> 00:34:31.218]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:33.919]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:34:46.343 --> 00:34:58.410]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:59.110]  Thank you.
[00:35:01.111 --> 00:35:03.293]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:35:03.873 --> 00:35:06.655]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:12.535 --> 00:35:17.640]  Okay, Jim Tucker is popping in at the start of the next hour.
[00:35:19.873 --> 00:35:24.074]  At Bilderberg 2010, this is really shaking up the global elite.
[00:35:25.234 --> 00:35:39.117]  Joining us is former military intelligence, one of the biggest private silver and gold broker, had the largest newsletter until he retired, he's come back with it in the last decade, and been a staple of this transmission, Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:35:39.517 --> 00:35:42.418]  Now in this hour with Bob Chapman, I want to hit on a bunch of other
[00:35:43.438 --> 00:35:50.904]  Uh, economic news, Korea news, Israel news, with the flotilla, uh, just a bunch of important info.
[00:35:51.204 --> 00:36:00.472]  But I wanted to, out of the gates, just remind listeners, especially those watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, go up to PrisonPlanet.tv, burn, in-game, Invisible Empire.
[00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:02.814]  You know, my film's on the disc!
[00:36:04.457 --> 00:36:05.739]  And give them to people.
[00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:06.700]  It's really good quality.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.564]  It's not total DVD quality, but it plays on DVD players.
[00:36:10.145 --> 00:36:14.051]  And people are ready to see Endgame and learn about the world government and their master plan.
[00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:17.896]  They're ready to see Invisible Empire that covers, you know, the latest world government information.
[00:36:18.036 --> 00:36:18.897]  So important!
[00:36:19.178 --> 00:36:20.980]  Yes, you know all about this, listeners!
[00:36:21.641 --> 00:36:35.846]  But the general public doesn't know about the 10th and 9th Amendment, and state sovereignty, and the difference between democracy and republic, and how we're getting sheriffs elected and taking our country back, and how all the incumbents are being thrown out in every election now, in all these off-year elections and primaries.
[00:36:36.067 --> 00:36:37.007]  The globalists are in trouble!
[00:36:37.307 --> 00:36:41.108]  Get Don't Tread on Me, in-game, Invisible Empire, at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:49.095]  Order the hard copy DVD with expanded extras, and it's great to give as a gift, the high quality DVD, the best quality.
[00:36:49.455 --> 00:36:53.118]  Or just go in Guerrilla Warfare to PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:36:53.719 --> 00:36:57.762]  Download it, burn it to disk, air it on AXS TV, get it out to everyone!
[00:36:58.143 --> 00:36:59.804]  Every person you reach is vital!
[00:37:01.165 --> 00:37:08.812]  Now to illustrate this, I'm not going to have time to play it today, but in Paul Joseph Watson's... You know, I've never put the entire speech up.
[00:37:09.795 --> 00:37:12.734]  I knew the speech was important that I did in front of Bilderberg.
[00:37:14.056 --> 00:37:18.537]  They sent out Richard C. Holbrook, top globalist, even in Obama's administration.
[00:37:18.577 --> 00:37:22.898]  He was coming to speak to us, and I screamed at him and said, Holbrook, get over here!
[00:37:23.258 --> 00:37:27.319]  And he said, ah, forget it, about 100 yards away, and we've got video, and turned and walked.
[00:37:27.379 --> 00:37:28.139]  I should have been nice.
[00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:30.319]  Because he's this big ambassador.
[00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:34.580]  He was going to, I guess, come try to, oh, come on, guys, stop bullhorning us.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:42.862]  I mean, this would have been a rare first Bilderberg reaching out, but that was an example of me, not very diplomatic, like, ah, ah, just like,
[00:37:43.942 --> 00:38:02.453]  But the issue is, we ran back to the hotel, the guys, and just four years ago, so it was a lot less, you know, techy, they quickly grabbed the video, low res, so we could upload it to YouTube, and that's the old video that's all over the web, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views, the one polling, it only has a few thousand, you know, that variant.
[00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:06.596]  I've got all the footage of the whole first half of my speech, because
[00:38:08.066 --> 00:38:15.246]  Because of file size and speed, I never even... I've got thousands of hours of incredible footage of everything you can imagine, I've never even aired.
[00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:19.650]  I need to, like, I don't have the money to hire somebody just to dump it all to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.311]  You know, that's the answer.
[00:38:21.351 --> 00:38:30.018]  I need to just somehow, because we're trying to raise the capital here to finish the studio and do all this, to just have an employee who just grabs raw video and interviews.
[00:38:30.559 --> 00:38:40.627]  I mean, I've got rooms full of DV cam tapes and just dump this treasure trove up there, but the point is, I want to get Bob Chapman's take on this because it dovetails with our discussion last week.
[00:38:41.926 --> 00:38:45.049]  Bilderberg 2010, the security lockdown begins.
[00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.650]  This is London Guardian.
[00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.571]  Give me a screenshot of this.
[00:38:47.611 --> 00:38:47.891]  Thank you.
[00:38:50.226 --> 00:39:00.391]  And in it, he's there the night before it shuts, and you can see top Bilderberg staff at the hotel wearing certain badges, and I've been there and been thrown out as well as they shut.
[00:39:00.751 --> 00:39:07.895]  And they're at dinner, and here's this reporter with his wife who came over from England to cover it, and he's hearing them go, oh yes, Alex Jones, he's very frightening.
[00:39:08.195 --> 00:39:09.596]  2006, they bullhorned us.
[00:39:09.856 --> 00:39:11.477]  They may try to attack us this time.
[00:39:11.617 --> 00:39:15.159]  Oh, many of the delegates didn't show up this time because they're scared.
[00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:17.820]  Oh my, oh my lord, it's so deadly.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:25.586]  So, that goes back to Brzezinski three weeks ago saying, for the first time in the whole world's awake, the global government's in trouble.
[00:39:26.006 --> 00:39:27.427]  And some said, oh, he's playing possum.
[00:39:27.967 --> 00:39:31.370]  No, he's there being a realist saying, we are in trouble.
[00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.672]  He's one of the top strategists in the world for these people.
[00:39:34.392 --> 00:39:37.214]  I mean, he's there, world government extraordinaire.
[00:39:38.475 --> 00:39:42.919]  Brags he ran the Khmer Rouge operation, killing 30% of Cambodia.
[00:39:42.959 --> 00:39:45.561]  He brags that he got our government to fund that.
[00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:51.126]  This is a very wicked person, Obama's top foreign advisor on geopolitical strategies.
[00:39:52.047 --> 00:39:54.448]  And he said, we are in great danger.
[00:39:57.142 --> 00:39:58.483]  They are not invincible.
[00:39:58.643 --> 00:39:59.604]  They are in trouble.
[00:39:59.905 --> 00:40:02.607]  And then he talked to Tucker, whose source said, yes, they're scared.
[00:40:02.887 --> 00:40:04.889]  This is the first time a bunch of delegates didn't show up.
[00:40:04.949 --> 00:40:11.675]  And then, major German and Spanish papers at a press conference followed Bill Gates, who flew in the eugenicist.
[00:40:11.975 --> 00:40:13.477]  This is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:13.957 --> 00:40:16.720]  He had a whole fake medical conference as his cover.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.861]  It wasn't real.
[00:40:18.441 --> 00:40:21.044]  So they caught up with him and he admitted he was there for Bilderberg.
[00:40:21.684 --> 00:40:21.884]  So,
[00:40:23.052 --> 00:40:24.333]  This is getting insane.
[00:40:24.453 --> 00:40:26.313]  I mean, they are scared.
[00:40:26.794 --> 00:40:38.279]  And Skelton said that Spanish police, because Catalonia has always been rebellious against tyranny, a lot of rebellions there, very beautiful area, if you study the history, and the people are very independent, you know, like Americans and others.
[00:40:39.179 --> 00:41:06.848]  uh... and of you know very rebellious folks that police were coming out across the line and joining the people and i saw footage were protesters were shoving police in the police were being nice and friendly and saying please you know i'm uh... you can read their lips you know i'm with you in the protesters were back off it usually spanish police would beat the daylights out of you they're known for being vicious uh... more than many uh... very you know they'll shoot you but no the police are even letting people attack them basically so uh... bob chapman this is incredible is it not
[00:41:08.015 --> 00:41:13.399]  It certainly is, and Catalonia is one of the great places in Spain.
[00:41:14.519 --> 00:41:18.522]  I also like down the coast at Marbella and Tarapolines and Málaga.
[00:41:21.304 --> 00:41:23.885]  And I'm a big fan of Barcelona, the football team.
[00:41:26.127 --> 00:41:35.733]  But they couldn't have been stupider than to have that conference in Catalonia, near Barcelona, on the north of the coast.
[00:41:36.781 --> 00:41:39.783]  Um, as you well know, Dan Lee Esslin's over there.
[00:41:39.803 --> 00:41:42.984]  And Dan, he's a Spanish citizen.
[00:41:44.145 --> 00:41:52.009]  And I think that we're going to end up getting far more out of this meeting than we have ever gotten before.
[00:41:52.629 --> 00:41:56.851]  Because he speaks the same language as the people who work there.
[00:41:57.972 --> 00:42:00.013]  And I am sure he has convinced
[00:42:00.797 --> 00:42:02.918]  A number of them to feed him information.
[00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:07.899]  Well, he also just addressed a large portion of the Parliament over there.
[00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:14.121]  Farage and others and one of the Italian EU members got him in to address him.
[00:42:14.501 --> 00:42:17.202]  And so it's now in hundreds of newspapers and televisions.
[00:42:17.222 --> 00:42:20.603]  So, you know, Mario Borgheseo.
[00:42:20.623 --> 00:42:21.403]  So this is huge.
[00:42:22.543 --> 00:42:23.063]  That's right.
[00:42:23.203 --> 00:42:23.863]  It is huge.
[00:42:24.664 --> 00:42:29.225]  And people who didn't know, although most people don't realize it,
[00:42:30.499 --> 00:42:42.347]  Europeans are very sophisticated politically, and they've known of this sort of thing, and other things that are akin to it, have been going on for many years.
[00:42:42.848 --> 00:42:57.258]  And they've had such problems in Europe, with one war after another, that they tend to stay apart from it and say, look, I just want to live, leave me alone, I don't want to get shot at, you know, I don't want another war, and you've got to understand where they're coming from.
[00:42:58.201 --> 00:42:59.642]  And they've had terrible times.
[00:42:59.823 --> 00:43:02.345]  I mean, the 1920s and 30s in Europe were dreadful.
[00:43:02.365 --> 00:43:09.330]  And it's no wonder people like Stalin and Mussolini and Hitler came to power.
[00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:14.295]  Of course, as we all know, they were financed from the UK and the US, etc.
[00:43:15.444 --> 00:43:16.765]  But, they made a mistake.
[00:43:17.045 --> 00:43:19.626]  I think Danny's gonna come up with piles of stuff.
[00:43:20.006 --> 00:43:39.393]  Well, we know Tucker already is, but expanding in that, let's talk about your take on the fact that they are so scared, and for the first time ever, a bunch of attendees didn't show up, and they're literally, the night before they shut it, the head organizers are like Bilderberg minions,
[00:43:40.293 --> 00:43:42.595]  They're scary, Alex Jones, oh!
[00:43:42.895 --> 00:43:46.258]  I mean, this mindset that we're like these dangerous devils.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.482]  Well, everything we do is literal.
[00:43:51.222 --> 00:43:53.745]  We do it over the radio and, of course, we publish.
[00:43:54.645 --> 00:43:56.887]  And they can't stand the truth.
[00:43:57.468 --> 00:44:00.090]  And you and I have been talking about this for months on end.
[00:44:01.211 --> 00:44:08.077]  And especially telling was what you brought up again about Brzezinski and his commentary at the CFR meeting in Montreal.
[00:44:09.434 --> 00:44:12.496]  They're terrified because there's no way back for them.
[00:44:13.836 --> 00:44:15.857]  The question is, how can I get out of all this?
[00:44:16.237 --> 00:44:17.198]  There's only one way.
[00:44:17.858 --> 00:44:19.419]  They've got to have a major war.
[00:44:20.279 --> 00:44:20.880]  And it's coming.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:28.864]  And it could have been that the incidents with North Korea and Israel could have been precursors to that.
[00:44:29.904 --> 00:44:31.765]  Now we got another ship going in now.
[00:44:32.786 --> 00:44:33.906]  I think it's from Ireland.
[00:44:35.127 --> 00:44:35.447]  And are the
[00:44:38.228 --> 00:44:42.389]  Turkish warships going to escort this vessel, as we have heard?
[00:44:42.409 --> 00:44:46.570]  Yeah, that's another issue.
[00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:49.391]  We learned this American got shot four times in the head.
[00:44:50.712 --> 00:44:52.632]  You've got all these other aid ships coming in.
[00:44:52.652 --> 00:44:58.894]  The Turks are now saying they're going to at least break ties with Israel, and they've now confirmed they are sending in warships.
[00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:02.115]  So, and the Prime Minister
[00:45:02.995 --> 00:45:06.496]  Like we have that clip, it's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet, it's in Turkish.
[00:45:07.316 --> 00:45:14.338]  But he just said, you know, we're now basically your enemy, Israel, and you're a bunch of liars, and we're sick of your lies.
[00:45:14.838 --> 00:45:18.219]  So, I mean, the whole world is really turning against Israel.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:32.103]  And I want to, most of you people don't know this because you're younger, and I'm older, and the Turks are renowned as fighters.
[00:45:33.914 --> 00:45:41.857]  Maybe the Israeli Defense Force is very, very good, but I certainly wouldn't want to tangle with them.
[00:45:42.057 --> 00:45:50.120]  And when we had the Korean conflict, as it was called, and it was run by the U.N.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:46:02.764]  so that the enemy knew everything we were going to do until MacArthur said, well, I've had enough of that, and maybe Inchon Landing, and just absolutely destroyed the
[00:46:03.502 --> 00:46:04.863]  Chinese and the North Koreans.
[00:46:05.683 --> 00:46:14.368]  But every time they would send Americans into the line, they would put the Australians on one side of them and the Turks on the other.
[00:46:15.649 --> 00:46:24.114]  And both of them were very, very anxious and adept at putting their bayonets on their rifles and going after the enemy.
[00:46:25.354 --> 00:46:27.336]  And the Turks have to draw blood.
[00:46:28.376 --> 00:46:31.338]  And if they can't get somebody to draw blood on, it's their own.
[00:46:32.296 --> 00:46:35.479]  And so they're quite ferocious people when it comes to warfare.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.466]  Well, that's because it was Constantinople and was a constant scene of warfare for thousands of years in the heart of the Ottoman Empire.
[00:46:43.887 --> 00:46:49.852]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, as Turkey and Israel collide towards confrontation.
[00:46:50.653 --> 00:46:53.135]  The North Korean peninsula is heating up.
[00:46:53.175 --> 00:46:55.177]  Their ambassador is saying, get ready for war.
[00:46:55.598 --> 00:46:58.040]  We'll discuss it all on the other side with Bob Chappell.
[00:47:01.001 --> 00:47:05.228]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:09.616]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:47:09.896 --> 00:47:15.205]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:47:17.133 --> 00:47:21.815]  Control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:47:22.075 --> 00:47:25.356]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:47:25.656 --> 00:47:29.377]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:47:30.377 --> 00:47:32.738]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:47:33.138 --> 00:47:36.499]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.481]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:46.502]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:47:46.802 --> 00:47:50.803]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:47:50.963 --> 00:47:52.504]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:47:52.744 --> 00:47:57.345]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:48:01.644 --> 00:48:02.465]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:48:02.665 --> 00:48:08.008]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:08.628]  I get it.
[00:48:08.748 --> 00:48:18.074]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:19.555]  That's not what's happening.
[00:48:19.775 --> 00:48:24.138]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[00:48:24.358 --> 00:48:26.040]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.021]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[00:48:28.242 --> 00:48:31.505]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:48:31.625 --> 00:48:35.728]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:48:35.909 --> 00:48:37.470]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:40.733]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:48:41.454 --> 00:48:45.077]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:48:45.277 --> 00:48:45.998]  You should, too.
[00:48:46.178 --> 00:48:47.159]  Find out what they know.
[00:48:47.339 --> 00:48:50.582]  Call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:48:50.862 --> 00:48:50.922]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:50.942 --> 00:48:50.982]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:51.002 --> 00:48:51.202]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:49:01.141 --> 00:49:06.004]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:49:06.104 --> 00:49:06.885]  What have we got?
[00:49:07.105 --> 00:49:09.246]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:49:09.566 --> 00:49:10.287]  A republic.
[00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:13.148]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:49:13.209 --> 00:49:15.110]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:17.391]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:49:17.491 --> 00:49:18.772]  So they think they own our land?
[00:49:19.172 --> 00:49:20.293]  They think they own our water?
[00:49:20.493 --> 00:49:20.893]  Children?
[00:49:21.113 --> 00:49:21.894]  Our education?
[00:49:22.234 --> 00:49:22.875]  Our money?
[00:49:23.055 --> 00:49:26.697]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:49:27.074 --> 00:49:31.699]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:49:32.039 --> 00:49:32.880]  We have the facts.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.181]  We have the Constitution.
[00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:35.102]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:49:35.122 --> 00:49:35.963]  We have common law.
[00:49:36.023 --> 00:49:38.265]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:38.544 --> 00:49:41.245]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:49:41.485 --> 00:49:42.325]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:49:42.405 --> 00:49:47.207]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:49:47.387 --> 00:49:48.747]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:49:48.887 --> 00:49:49.708]  Don't Tread on Me.
[00:49:49.968 --> 00:49:56.390]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:02.830]  The problem.
[00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.991]  How do I cook food without power?
[00:50:05.472 --> 00:50:07.653]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[00:50:08.193 --> 00:50:10.394]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.515]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[00:50:13.376 --> 00:50:22.160]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.

[00:50:57.015 --> 00:51:00.096]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[00:51:10.205 --> 00:51:20.629]  Paul Dornanew, a Romanian journalist that gave us incredible video and photos from Bilderberg Group 2007, speaking of Turkey, in Istanbul.
[00:51:20.889 --> 00:51:22.950]  Just amazing footage and photos.
[00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:28.273]  He just sent us a bunch of photos that are going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next 20 minutes.
[00:51:28.573 --> 00:51:31.234]  He'll be joining us in the last 30 minutes today, Nigel Farage.
[00:51:32.486 --> 00:51:35.188]  Who narrowly survived that plane crash on election day.
[00:51:35.968 --> 00:51:38.850]  The head of the UK Independence Party will be joining us.
[00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.271]  Member of the European Union Parliament to talk about a host of issues.
[00:51:43.072 --> 00:51:44.353]  But going back to Bob Chapman.
[00:51:45.153 --> 00:51:56.820]  Bob, looking at this Israel situation, I even had former Mossad spy master on yesterday to get his take and even
[00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:07.418]  Even this guy, of course he was in the Washington Post criticizing the raid, calling it so stupid it's stupefying, saying, what is Israel thinking?
[00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:13.844]  Any way you cut it, men coming into a ship at night in international water, shooting an American four times in the head.
[00:52:14.565 --> 00:52:16.907]  I mean, Israel has been supported by this country.
[00:52:16.987 --> 00:52:20.489]  It's been seen as the underdog when the Arabs attacked it over and over again.
[00:52:20.509 --> 00:52:23.351]  But they're really losing that underdog status.
[00:52:23.911 --> 00:52:25.352]  But Israel's not going anywhere.
[00:52:25.372 --> 00:52:26.033]  You know, that's the thing.
[00:52:26.053 --> 00:52:29.535]  They're saying, we got 400 nukes and we don't care what the world says.
[00:52:29.615 --> 00:52:31.076]  And now neocons in the U.S.
[00:52:31.116 --> 00:52:34.578]  are saying in the New York Times, well, we may just have to nuke.
[00:52:34.638 --> 00:52:36.500]  Israel may just nuke Iran first.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.841]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:52:38.901 --> 00:52:40.763]  I mean, is Israel going to start World War III?
[00:52:40.783 --> 00:52:42.664]  Could very well be.
[00:52:43.464 --> 00:52:54.734]  And I don't think they do much of anything without consulting the people who run things out of New York and London, and particularly in this case, New York and Washington.
[00:52:55.615 --> 00:53:07.106]  And I think that in order to go ahead with such an operation, and it really was very poorly planned, I think they were looking for an excuse.
[00:53:07.887 --> 00:53:17.011]  To get a war started, and of course the Turkish ships come in, with the aid ships, and Israel decides to fire on them, you got a third world war going.
[00:53:18.191 --> 00:53:19.532]  It's really as simple as that.
[00:53:20.832 --> 00:53:25.034]  I mean, you know, we had first world war, Archduke Ferdinand get assassinated.
[00:53:25.934 --> 00:53:28.696]  All it took was one bullet and the game was gone.
[00:53:28.756 --> 00:53:34.218]  And the US got brought into World War I by the sinking of the Lusitania, running the German U-boat blockade.
[00:53:35.598 --> 00:53:36.799]  Loaded with munitions.
[00:53:37.748 --> 00:53:38.889]  With people upstairs.
[00:53:38.909 --> 00:53:44.593]  And so these things just don't happen, they're planned.
[00:53:45.434 --> 00:53:54.600]  And we've seen a succession of events that could be called either false flag or leading events.
[00:53:55.501 --> 00:54:04.828]  And I think that's what this Israel thing could very well be because I think that they're ready to go ahead with their war, if not they're close to it.
[00:54:06.505 --> 00:54:10.249]  I've been talking about it for a long time, but never putting a date on it because I didn't know.
[00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:16.935]  But this indicates to me that the possibility this could be a catalytic event.
[00:54:18.717 --> 00:54:19.858]  Well, Viktor Ovshrosty...
[00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.293]  And it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse.
[00:54:53.692 --> 00:54:54.193]  Exactly.
[00:54:54.213 --> 00:55:04.435]  And you know, they might have called up Washington and said, hey, look, you know, we got all these problems going on and explained them.
[00:55:04.455 --> 00:55:07.596]  And Washington and New York probably said, well, we understand that.
[00:55:07.636 --> 00:55:09.057]  So let's get the war on.
[00:55:09.097 --> 00:55:10.837]  I mean, you got all these problems in Europe.
[00:55:11.917 --> 00:55:14.978]  The Austrian president didn't attend the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:55:15.698 --> 00:55:18.999]  They may be getting set to front run and default.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:20.960]  I mean, we don't even know.
[00:55:21.957 --> 00:55:29.280]  And, you know, we've got five other countries that are up for grabs as far as devaluation or leaving the euro or defaulting.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.880]  What did you make of the British?
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:35.522]  Because you talked about a few months ago, you said, look to England to try to scuttle Europe.
[00:55:35.902 --> 00:55:40.324]  I mean, is that good advice that top British companies are giving Greece?
[00:55:40.944 --> 00:55:43.605]  And now they're even telling Spain, hey, just go ahead and default.
[00:55:45.146 --> 00:55:45.386]  Right.
[00:55:45.466 --> 00:55:48.207]  And I think that is part of the
[00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:56.476]  Opening salvo on the part of England to try to resurrect itself.
[00:55:56.496 --> 00:55:59.679]  And they're in just a monstrous trouble.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:07.565]  And the way for them to get out is they don't belong to the Eurozone.
[00:56:07.605 --> 00:56:13.991]  For those of you who don't know, they have their pound, which is their currency, but they belong to the European Union.
[00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:15.192]  And I think
[00:56:16.164 --> 00:56:17.605]  And I projected this before.
[00:56:18.085 --> 00:56:34.172]  A way for England to try to begin to escape this lock that they've been thrown into would be to start getting their industries going again and start rebuilding manufacturing-wise.
[00:56:34.973 --> 00:56:40.716]  In order to do that, they're going to have to leave the EU because they're going to have to leave the World Trade Organization.
[00:56:40.976 --> 00:56:41.676]  All right, stay there.
[00:56:41.716 --> 00:56:42.356]  We got to go to break.
[00:56:42.396 --> 00:56:45.578]  I want to come back and get into the economy here at home.
[00:56:50.996 --> 00:56:54.004]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:56:54.926 --> 00:56:57.613]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:01.656 --> 00:57:09.781]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:57:10.141 --> 00:57:20.588]  As of January 1st, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:57:21.028 --> 00:57:26.472]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:57:27.012 --> 00:57:31.495]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:57:31.895 --> 00:57:40.621]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:57:40.981 --> 00:57:50.808]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:57:51.088 --> 00:57:54.250]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:55.791]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:58:00.282 --> 00:58:04.525]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:04.845 --> 00:58:05.446]  Number 1.
[00:58:05.746 --> 00:58:08.908]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:09.169 --> 00:58:09.729]  Number 2.
[00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:14.593]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:14.933 --> 00:58:15.373]  It's true.
[00:58:15.673 --> 00:58:20.237]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:20.537 --> 00:58:21.097]  Number 3.
[00:58:21.378 --> 00:58:24.660]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.663]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:28.863 --> 00:58:29.404]  Number 4.
[00:58:29.644 --> 00:58:32.026]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:32.407 --> 00:58:35.810]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:36.091 --> 00:58:36.311]  Number 5.
[00:58:36.891 --> 00:58:40.816]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:41.036 --> 00:58:45.801]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:58:46.081 --> 00:58:50.104]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:50.244 --> 00:58:51.806]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:52.046 --> 00:58:54.107]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:58:54.268 --> 00:58:56.890]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:58:56.910 --> 00:59:05.917]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:59:07.158 --> 00:59:11.922]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:12.302 --> 00:59:13.763]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:59:16.348 --> 00:59:19.073]  Well, they make blue diamond-gusset jeans.
[00:59:21.016 --> 00:59:23.320]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:27.446]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:59:29.506 --> 00:59:33.387]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:59:34.087 --> 00:59:37.208]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:59:37.928 --> 00:59:38.748]  Others don't.
[00:59:39.148 --> 00:59:41.049]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:42.809]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:43.089 --> 00:59:45.650]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:52.231]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:59:52.591 --> 00:59:54.792]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:57.333]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:59:57.673 --> 00:59:58.533]  Others don't.
[01:00:08.929 --> 01:00:14.073]  We got Mr. Dornanoo from Romania covering Bilderberg in Spain, popping in the last 20 minutes or so.
[01:00:14.094 --> 01:00:16.135]  Jim Tucker coming up, popping in as well.
[01:00:16.856 --> 01:00:23.021]  We've got Nigel Farage, former head of the UK Independence Party, current member of the European Union Parliament.
[01:00:23.561 --> 01:00:25.903]  Almost died in a plane crash, very mysterious.
[01:00:26.344 --> 01:00:28.726]  He'll give us his take on the state of the meltdown in Europe.
[01:00:28.746 --> 01:00:32.188]  A lot of Americans send me emails and say, why should I care about Europe plunging?
[01:00:32.509 --> 01:00:33.690]  That means I'll get ahead.
[01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:37.413]  How somebody somewhere in history got the idea in their mind
[01:00:38.732 --> 01:00:41.593]  That plunging economies somewhere in the world helps us.
[01:00:41.633 --> 01:00:42.793]  That's not how the world works.
[01:00:43.654 --> 01:00:45.974]  When your neighbor's doing better, you're going to do better.
[01:00:46.775 --> 01:00:51.356]  But they've taught people in the modern age that when people do bad, you somehow get ahead.
[01:00:51.376 --> 01:01:00.119]  You know, it's like there's a sum set, like there's one pizza in the world and whoever gets a piece, you know, how about we build a pizza factory?
[01:01:01.219 --> 01:01:02.100]  Unlimited pizza.
[01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:10.570]  I run into this denial, like, so what if the stock market plunges, or so what if the dollar devalues?
[01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:12.391]  Well, that'll destroy your future.
[01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:16.293]  Even if you don't own stocks, everything you do is connected to those stocks.
[01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:21.315]  I mean, they've designed a financial system that must be reversed if we're going to have any future.
[01:01:21.335 --> 01:01:25.177]  We'll talk about that with Bob Chapman here in just a moment, go over a bunch of news with him.
[01:01:25.977 --> 01:01:31.180]  But before I do that, I wanted to thank a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast possible.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.361]  One of them
[01:01:33.715 --> 01:01:34.716]  This is FrontSight.com.
[01:01:34.776 --> 01:01:35.797]  Look at the front of your rifle.
[01:01:35.837 --> 01:01:36.717]  FrontSight.com.
[01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:40.000]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.083]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:01:43.463 --> 01:01:50.649]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at FrontSight's Firearm Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:55.913]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:01:56.393 --> 01:02:01.798]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:02:02.503 --> 01:02:10.885]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes and the Millionaire Patriot is paying his own money to help you get this.
[01:02:11.265 --> 01:02:11.985]  This is real.
[01:02:12.345 --> 01:02:14.486]  Thousands have already taken advantage of it.
[01:02:14.526 --> 01:02:15.126]  You should too.
[01:02:15.206 --> 01:02:15.946]  Don't miss out.
[01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:17.647]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:22.868]  That's FrontSight.com and receive your free gun.
[01:02:24.304 --> 01:02:26.809]  And lastly, I love this sponsor.
[01:02:26.849 --> 01:02:32.501]  My wife, every time we run out, this is one vitamin, mineral supplement she makes sure that she reorders.
[01:02:33.203 --> 01:02:35.347]  And we've been using it, I don't know, five years now or so.
[01:02:37.636 --> 01:02:38.977]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:02:39.317 --> 01:02:40.217]  You've heard of green foods.
[01:02:40.237 --> 01:02:41.077]  Well, this is the best.
[01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:44.319]  Raw, unpasteurized, superfoods.
[01:02:44.879 --> 01:02:46.099]  Innerfood.com.
[01:02:46.339 --> 01:02:49.440]  E-N-E-R, food.com, or 866-762-9238.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:59.624]  Inner Health Botanicals, a fantastic company that's been sponsoring us for years, have been providing products for the past five years that give you the perfect solution to keeping your body healthy.
[01:02:59.964 --> 01:03:05.066]  Try the Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you energy and keeps you well.

[01:03:10.308 --> 01:03:15.391]  Try their NutriCafe Amazing Organic Coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:03:16.131 --> 01:03:19.372]  Now that's something you don't see in store shelves every day.
[01:03:19.513 --> 01:03:22.654]  Enterfood.com, check them out or give them a call right now.
[01:03:22.654 --> 01:03:23.094]  That's right.
[01:03:42.632 --> 01:03:49.314]  Now it's not Bob Chapman two years ago talking about the plunge of Europe starting in Greece and then Spain and Portugal and other places.
[01:03:49.714 --> 01:03:52.075]  Now it's all over the news, total collapse.
[01:03:53.075 --> 01:03:54.876]  But some people think that the U.S.
[01:03:54.936 --> 01:03:55.936]  is going to escape this.
[01:03:56.576 --> 01:04:03.839]  Can you explain to people, because Europe cheered when we plunged two years ago to the bankers, and then now some Americans are cheering.
[01:04:04.879 --> 01:04:10.381]  This is like gouging one of your eyes out and the right eye laughing at the left eye.
[01:04:10.401 --> 01:04:11.461]  Can you explain that to people?
[01:04:12.742 --> 01:04:19.065]  Well, what they've done is they've created interconnectivity.
[01:04:20.326 --> 01:04:25.308]  And it's been put in place throughout the entire world over the past 30 years.
[01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:33.212]  And what that means is every time is that action is a reaction.
[01:04:33.232 --> 01:04:36.914]  And it's good if everybody does well.
[01:04:38.095 --> 01:04:40.736]  If, as you said, one party gets in trouble,
[01:04:41.175 --> 01:04:42.556]  That's not to your advantage.
[01:04:44.377 --> 01:04:46.439]  It's to your ultimate disadvantage.
[01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:47.900]  We'll take a good example.
[01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:52.063]  The pound just dropped from 1.50 to 1.20.
[01:04:53.665 --> 01:05:00.910]  That means that goods that are expressed in Euros are going to be cheaper.
[01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.712]  Maybe 12-15% cheaper.
[01:05:04.473 --> 01:05:06.234]  Who is the biggest exporter in Europe?
[01:05:07.175 --> 01:05:07.675]  Germany.
[01:05:08.596 --> 01:05:09.937]  They're going to make out from that.
[01:05:10.814 --> 01:05:23.917]  But on the other hand, because of the drop in their currency, the amount that they pay for imported goods such as oil, energy products, is going to go up.
[01:05:24.897 --> 01:05:35.880]  And so what Germany is doing right now, knowing that is going to be the case, they are implementing austerity cuts.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.541]  They're not expanding or anything like that.
[01:05:40.222 --> 01:05:43.424]  Because they know that their costs are going to go up.
[01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:55.391]  Of course.
[01:05:55.671 --> 01:06:02.935]  Okay, good, because this is developing and moving, and what you were talking about is so important, and you've been so dead on, theinternationalforecaster.com.
[01:06:03.195 --> 01:06:08.797]  We're now joined by the granddaddy of exposing the Bilderberg Group, and he's got to be proud of himself.
[01:06:08.817 --> 01:06:14.400]  33, 34 years covering it, going to every conference, being shot at in Portugal.
[01:06:15.561 --> 01:06:16.121]  Oh, always fun.
[01:06:45.888 --> 01:06:52.071]  Jim, I know you're busy and exhausted, but... Hold on just a minute while I reach down and grab my special cause.
[01:06:52.151 --> 01:06:53.432]  I got information you want.
[01:06:53.912 --> 01:06:55.273]  Just bear with me a minute.
[01:06:55.954 --> 01:07:03.778]  Yeah, and literally, folks, he's so mobbed by reporters, and he is not a spring chick, as they say.
[01:07:04.618 --> 01:07:09.900]  He literally has been fighting to even get to his hotel room for about 30 minutes just to even be on with us.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.461]  So we just got him as he got to his room and he's getting his satchel.
[01:07:14.501 --> 01:07:15.582]  He wasn't quite ready.
[01:07:16.442 --> 01:07:20.043]  And we're going to get him to give us, because he's got the real.
[01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:21.584]  Some people claim they have Goldberg sources.
[01:07:21.624 --> 01:07:24.405]  He's got them on the inside and on the outside.
[01:07:24.505 --> 01:07:27.226]  And so this is a big scoop we're about to get.
[01:07:27.386 --> 01:07:28.406]  Jim, do you have your satchel?
[01:07:29.266 --> 01:07:30.126]  Yes, now I'm ready.
[01:07:30.506 --> 01:07:34.667]  Okay, one very interesting development, which is encouraging, is that
[01:07:51.544 --> 01:07:59.270]  Some of the major Bilderberg people are saying that many, many, quote, important people, quote, are not attending this year.
[01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:03.013]  They always find out and we get in trouble at home.
[01:08:05.134 --> 01:08:15.422]  Politicians who are embarrassed when constituents call and say, why are you dealing with these monsters and so forth.
[01:08:19.056 --> 01:08:20.577]  That's a fun thing.
[01:08:21.418 --> 01:08:43.994]  They're also celebrating the fact that your president, Obama, has signed off on an international treaty which would allow the UN to come into your house and take your gun away as you're being bureaucrat.
[01:08:44.614 --> 01:08:48.017]  It's some kind of treaty called the National
[01:08:50.472 --> 01:08:50.893]  Absolutely.
[01:08:52.114 --> 01:08:53.195]  And he won't think about this.
[01:08:53.235 --> 01:08:54.737]  He might pollute George
[01:09:06.386 --> 01:09:07.447]  A little George Bush.
[01:09:07.787 --> 01:09:09.509]  They say it's not a treaty, it's just an agreement.
[01:09:10.129 --> 01:09:17.095]  But if there's a treaty, as you know under our Constitution, the treaty is the superior law of the land.
[01:09:17.255 --> 01:09:19.477]  That's why George Washington said, don't have any treaties.
[01:09:19.957 --> 01:09:20.658]  Don't have enemies.
[01:09:21.588 --> 01:09:22.189]  Be neutral.
[01:09:23.190 --> 01:09:25.392]  Be friendly with all nations, but partial to none.
[01:09:25.472 --> 01:09:27.914]  Well, Jim, to expand on that, what about the euro?
[01:09:27.934 --> 01:09:32.758]  Do they want to plunge the euro to bring in the SDR, or are they there trying to prop up the euro?
[01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:37.302]  Oh, they're determined to save the euro, and they're nervous.
[01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:41.446]  Nervous about it, though, of course, for the economic crisis.
[01:09:42.026 --> 01:09:44.048]  The euro is important because it's
[01:09:48.422 --> 01:09:51.646]  It's part of their world government program.
[01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:55.691]  They're very discouraged, thank goodness.
[01:09:59.088 --> 01:10:02.649]  They're very downbeat because they've fallen so far behind.
[01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:16.353]  As I said before, in the 1990s, Bill O'Byrne was absolutely confident that we'd have an American Union, the European Union, and the Asian-Pacific Union would be well underway.
[01:10:16.993 --> 01:10:21.655]  And they've fallen back, they've fallen behind, and they're very discouraged.
[01:10:22.235 --> 01:10:28.037]  But they're still persisting on climate change, as futile as that might be.
[01:10:28.817 --> 01:10:29.560]  Yes, you know these.
[01:10:31.388 --> 01:10:38.673]  We're talking about climatologists, experts in the field, who are...
[01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:10.794]  Yes, he is, and he's attended one Bilderberg meeting in the past, and this is his second Bilderberg meeting.
[01:11:10.814 --> 01:11:27.865]  And, oh, definitely they're going to push for climate change, even though they're so far behind on that with the scientists' letters proving this whole thing is a fraud.
[01:11:30.402 --> 01:11:36.289]  In fact, one billboard said, on climate change, we're about whipped.
[01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:38.631]  That's quote, quote, on climate change.
[01:11:38.912 --> 01:11:40.714]  We're about whipped!
[01:11:41.835 --> 01:11:43.017]  Incredible breaking news.
[01:11:43.377 --> 01:11:47.482]  And when will we be able to read this in detail at AmericanFreePress.net?
[01:11:49.719 --> 01:11:52.680]  Well, I'm not sure how fast we can get things on the internet.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.240]  I'm not high-tech, I'm a real man of faith.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:02.141]  Okay, but I mean, more details will be there and we're very appreciative of the newspaper allowing you to share your huge scoops with us.
[01:12:02.182 --> 01:12:08.203]  Again, the granddaddy of exposing this arm of the global government right up at the top of the pyramid, Jim Tucker.
[01:12:09.003 --> 01:12:13.344]  Also, I talked to Charlie Skelton of the London Guardian, who was there when they kicked him out.
[01:12:13.364 --> 01:12:14.284]  He overheard the head
[01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:16.045]  Yes, that's a fact.
[01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:18.906]  It came to me from a source who knows the Bilderberg people.
[01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:40.499]  He's done business with him.
[01:12:40.539 --> 01:12:45.303]  When I first talked to him about Billerberg 20-some years ago, he said, oh, yes.
[01:12:45.363 --> 01:12:49.586]  He's an international financial consultant.
[01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:54.290]  I dare not go beyond that in describing him, but he's helped us find Billerberg over the years.
[01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:56.932]  He's confirmed this and so forth.
[01:12:59.237 --> 01:13:00.958]  We're good to go.
[01:13:17.423 --> 01:13:28.809]  Of course, Bush Petroleum is in all the Shell and the other big international oil companies, Longman, Billerberg, Lumen areas, and they are competitors, but they're still a brotherhood.
[01:13:28.829 --> 01:13:37.354]  So they have agreed to allow Obama to be outraged and talk about criminal procedures against BP.
[01:13:38.854 --> 01:13:41.496]  But he's also referred to as
[01:13:45.278 --> 01:13:57.402]  So it's going to be a bunch of talk like the AIG charges they've now dropped and the Goldman Sachs, much ado about nothing, putting on a show.
[01:13:58.162 --> 01:13:59.402]  What about oil prices?
[01:13:59.582 --> 01:14:00.583]  What about the dollar?
[01:14:00.623 --> 01:14:10.226]  I mean, it sounds like from your past reportage, they're going from being in control and planning the future to just trying to maintain control.
[01:14:11.212 --> 01:14:12.513]  They're trying to maintain control.
[01:14:12.813 --> 01:14:18.658]  Now, their plan is for the gas prices to go down and be nice and cheap this summer.
[01:14:19.058 --> 01:14:25.703]  In the months ahead, they're to go up to $4 a gallon, starting probably around November, some such time.
[01:14:26.183 --> 01:14:28.545]  They're saying that we have to do some pacification here.
[01:14:29.686 --> 01:14:36.091]  But then, well, that's why they still maintain production of oil is only 80%, not 100% of easy capacity.
[01:14:41.457 --> 01:14:48.979]  For every hundred barrels that could be produced today, only 80 barrels are being produced to generate a future shortage.
[01:14:49.079 --> 01:14:50.239]  There's a shortage at the moment.
[01:14:50.439 --> 01:14:52.120]  Yeah, they're creating artificial scarcity.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.200]  Jim, such precious time with you.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:56.441]  What does this mean?
[01:14:56.481 --> 01:15:03.362]  I mean, how big is this that quite a few members, and do you have any intel on basic numbers?
[01:15:03.842 --> 01:15:04.803]  I mean, what percentage?
[01:15:05.023 --> 01:15:05.643]  10 percent?
[01:15:05.663 --> 01:15:06.063]  20 percent?
[01:15:06.403 --> 01:15:10.604]  I mean, this is obviously a crisis if they can't get their luminaries there.
[01:15:12.356 --> 01:15:15.938]  Oh, uh, do you want to roll down the list of confirmed participants so far?
[01:15:15.958 --> 01:15:18.539]  Well, I mean, any notables?
[01:15:18.559 --> 01:15:24.241]  We know who the regulars are, but is there any notable politician being groomed, like Mr. Cameron, who was groomed a few years ago?
[01:15:24.261 --> 01:15:27.663]  Uh, well, let's see.
[01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:34.526]  Uh, we know that, uh, Gessner, uh, was to be in, uh,
[01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:40.844]  Uh, South Korea for the G20, uh, Friday and Saturday.
[01:15:41.265 --> 01:15:49.116]  He may show up on, uh, Sunday or Monday, but, uh, nevertheless, Larry Summers, uh, will be there.
[01:15:49.136 --> 01:15:51.580]  That is the answer to your President.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.881]  Let's see, do you need more names?
[01:15:56.201 --> 01:15:56.861]  No, no, that's fine.
[01:15:56.881 --> 01:15:58.102]  Let me shift gears again.
[01:15:58.422 --> 01:15:59.523]  What about Iran?
[01:15:59.543 --> 01:16:00.864]  Anything about Iran?
[01:16:01.184 --> 01:16:02.364]  Israel's got nuke subs.
[01:16:02.404 --> 01:16:03.465]  They're saying they may attack.
[01:16:04.225 --> 01:16:05.686]  You've had the attack on the flotilla.
[01:16:06.607 --> 01:16:08.387]  The Israel-Iran flotilla.
[01:16:08.428 --> 01:16:09.048]  Anything on that?
[01:16:09.068 --> 01:16:12.470]  Yes, on the flotilla thing.
[01:16:16.293 --> 01:16:26.120]  Uh, they're a little skittish about that now, and Bilderberg is not 100% in favor of U.S.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:29.042]  airstrikes on Iran, but many of them are.
[01:16:31.827 --> 01:16:33.448]  Well, wars generate money.
[01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:36.630]  Good guys, bad guys, whatever.
[01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:41.233]  In all of our wars, we've had profiteering scandals on both sides.
[01:16:42.433 --> 01:16:45.635]  In most wars, all white hats can solve black hats.
[01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:54.220]  But in World War II, during the American Civil War, you had
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.563]  It's leaning toward war, but Bilderberg is not 100% in favor.
[01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:02.285]  Some in Europe say, no, we shouldn't do it.
[01:17:02.305 --> 01:17:04.526]  But most of them are in favor of American airstrikes against Iran.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:36.444]  Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[01:17:50.035 --> 01:18:00.966]  And there's some speculation that the assassination of President Kennedy may in some way reflect the fact that Kennedy was pressuring Israel to disarm.
[01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:04.970]  Israel has never joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
[01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:10.835]  They do not admit nor deny that they have nuclear weapons.
[01:18:11.795 --> 01:18:18.117]  Okay, but to be clear, I mean, you in 2002, you said Donald Graham of the Washington Post was there.
[01:18:18.557 --> 01:18:21.777]  He lied and said the attack would begin in 2002.
[01:18:21.877 --> 01:18:23.178]  You said March of 2003.
[01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:25.718]  A year before, you were right with precision.
[01:18:26.098 --> 01:18:27.779]  More than a year before.
[01:18:27.919 --> 01:18:30.940]  Because last year and the year before, you said Iran was not on the burner.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.180]  You're saying they are close to green lighting?
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.141]  I mean, be specific, Jim.
[01:18:35.161 --> 01:18:36.721]  This is big from your Bilderberg sources.
[01:18:37.141 --> 01:18:39.442]  You're saying they are moving towards green lighting?
[01:18:39.722 --> 01:18:40.982]  Or it has been green-lighted?
[01:18:41.809 --> 01:18:42.971]  I don't think so.
[01:19:01.443 --> 01:19:04.684]  Plus, isn't that a political diversion during their banking looting?
[01:19:04.744 --> 01:19:06.825]  Oh, well, it has that virtue too.
[01:19:07.405 --> 01:19:09.286]  It's also a diversion.
[01:19:09.326 --> 01:19:10.147]  But they also make money on
[01:19:24.755 --> 01:19:28.658]  These are guys in manufacturing.
[01:19:28.678 --> 01:19:34.421]  You make money when you're making tanks and airplanes and other raw materials.
[01:19:34.481 --> 01:19:35.662]  Yes, command destruction.
[01:19:35.682 --> 01:19:40.425]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm only going to keep you a few more minutes because I know you're busy, Jim, and once you're back in the U.S.
[01:19:40.465 --> 01:19:47.069]  and have written your articles, we'll have you up for a full debriefing, and we're very, very honored to have you here with us.
[01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:52.613]  And I do owe you a carton of cigarettes for the last time you were on the road for using up all your cell phone minutes.
[01:19:53.553 --> 01:19:54.534]  Yes, Brzezinski, we think, is going to be here.
[01:19:54.614 --> 01:19:55.494]  Again, they're struggling for
[01:20:23.605 --> 01:20:25.286]  We're good to go.
[01:20:46.115 --> 01:20:54.860]  Canada and throughout the European Union where you're paying well over 50% of your taxes to their national government.
[01:20:55.561 --> 01:20:58.343]  So domestication, they want to domesticate us further.
[01:20:58.363 --> 01:20:59.744]  Pardon?
[01:21:00.364 --> 01:21:01.925]  They want to domesticate us further.
[01:21:01.945 --> 01:21:05.627]  Yes, we've got to be Europeanized.
[01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:09.590]  We have to have their system of welfare where you retire at 55.
[01:21:10.891 --> 01:21:12.311]  Well, someday I'll be 55.
[01:21:12.852 --> 01:21:14.072]  Well, I'm 75.
[01:21:15.432 --> 01:21:16.072]  I'm 75.
[01:21:18.153 --> 01:21:26.295]  It'd be a horrible thing to happen to this country to come under the European style of healthcare.
[01:21:26.795 --> 01:21:30.476]  Well, European style of total socialism for that matter.
[01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:40.200]  All right, Jim, I want to have Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com, who's with us once a week, and we're breaking into his interview to have you here, but he's a big fan of yours.
[01:21:40.901 --> 01:21:45.144]  And so I want him to be able to ask you a question, and then I've got one final question for you.
[01:21:45.664 --> 01:21:50.889]  Bob Chapman, I'd like to hear any questions you've got for the legendary Jim Tucker.
[01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:58.535]  Well, I think the most important question that he's answered is that they're very concerned about the euro.
[01:21:59.327 --> 01:22:03.488]  And my take is that they're in for a big surprise.
[01:22:03.548 --> 01:22:04.889]  I think it's going to come unglued.
[01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:18.972]  We had discussed earlier, before Jim came on, about the possibility of an event being created with the Israeli incident in regard to the Gaza aid ships.
[01:22:19.733 --> 01:22:21.293]  And it could be the catalyst.
[01:22:22.092 --> 01:22:28.497]  And as Jim said, the majority is in favor of going into Iran.
[01:22:29.058 --> 01:22:34.602]  And if Brzezinski gets there, he'll be howling to go into Iran.
[01:22:34.622 --> 01:22:35.623]  Don't you think so, Jim?
[01:22:36.944 --> 01:22:40.827]  Yes, most definitely.
[01:22:40.867 --> 01:22:45.411]  Yeah, he's been an architect of the
[01:22:46.249 --> 01:22:56.694]  Of the goals throughout the Middle East and into the geopolitical outflanking of Russia.
[01:22:56.994 --> 01:22:58.234]  Now that's a great point.
[01:22:58.294 --> 01:22:59.395]  I'm going to hold you over.
[01:22:59.415 --> 01:23:03.517]  We're about to let Jim go and get some final comments from Bob Chapman here at the end.
[01:23:03.537 --> 01:23:08.759]  But Jim Tucker, anything else you haven't told us that is important to be relayed to the public?
[01:23:08.819 --> 01:23:13.561]  I mean, I hope people are paying very close attention to what you have to say because you have real sources.
[01:23:13.581 --> 01:23:15.502]  You don't just make stuff up and say that it came from
[01:23:15.942 --> 01:23:16.402]  Oh, yes it is.
[01:23:16.422 --> 01:23:18.003]  They're far behind schedule, the world government.
[01:23:45.583 --> 01:23:57.986]  But they are calling for an international night tax to be administered by the IMF, which is the future World Treasury Department.
[01:24:04.256 --> 01:24:11.658]  International bank tax where the Federal Trade Commission could say all these banks will pay a certain tax.
[01:24:12.439 --> 01:24:17.520]  Of course that makes up their higher charges on interest rates and so forth.
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:19.541]  It's not their own money, a really short money deal.
[01:24:19.561 --> 01:24:21.361]  And that's a way to shut down the smaller banks.
[01:24:21.501 --> 01:24:24.042]  In fact, you've been talking about that for 20 years as being on their agenda.
[01:24:24.282 --> 01:24:29.464]  They're now proposing a global government run by the IMF and World Bank that we all pay taxes to.
[01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:37.155]  Yes, Global Treasury Department under the IMF and the bank taxes.
[01:24:37.516 --> 01:24:41.558]  Oh, that's to address the economic crisis, of course.
[01:24:44.002 --> 01:24:44.823]  That's the rationale.
[01:24:45.463 --> 01:24:50.726]  So overall, would you say this is the most downbeat Bilderberg in the history of the Bilderberg?
[01:24:50.746 --> 01:24:52.187]  I would say so, yes.
[01:24:53.087 --> 01:25:00.852]  When certain, quote, important people, unquote, are not coming because of the flack they get at home, because all these people are exposing us.
[01:25:00.912 --> 01:25:03.073]  We get all this mail, all these calls.
[01:25:04.774 --> 01:25:05.655]  That's just wonderful.
[01:25:05.755 --> 01:25:10.918]  I hope these very important people suffer like they deserve to suffer.
[01:25:11.437 --> 01:25:14.539]  So they're very upset by the exposure, thanks to you and others.
[01:25:14.559 --> 01:25:22.124]  Well, Jim, it's got to feel good, 33, 34 years later, to see this mighty harvest of awakening.
[01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:24.025]  Yes, it will be.
[01:25:24.785 --> 01:25:27.087]  Like you said, we'll get together, but I've got to get home.
[01:25:28.047 --> 01:25:30.149]  All right, Jim Tucker, AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:32.930]  People can subscribe there, get a hard copy, or read it online.
[01:25:33.271 --> 01:25:34.431]  Thank you for giving us time.
[01:25:34.691 --> 01:25:36.132]  We appreciate you joining us, Jim.
[01:25:36.533 --> 01:25:38.394]  My pleasure, and I'll talk to you later.
[01:25:38.614 --> 01:25:40.295]  All right, we're going to come back with Bob Chapman.
[01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:44.073]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:25:45.516 --> 01:25:47.719]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:54.522 --> 01:25:55.443]  Tyranny is here.
[01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:59.286]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:01.928]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:07.412]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:14.078]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:26:14.478 --> 01:26:20.022]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:26:20.442 --> 01:26:24.145]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:26:24.645 --> 01:26:28.608]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:26:28.928 --> 01:26:34.432]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:26:34.873 --> 01:26:37.855]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:26:38.435 --> 01:26:39.876]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:26:40.416 --> 01:26:40.837]  It's here.
[01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:48.542]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:26:53.565 --> 01:26:55.487]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:55.947 --> 01:26:58.729]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:06.496 --> 01:27:11.840]  You know, I thought it was one of his first interviews, but it's his first interview since the plane crash that almost killed him.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.021]  Nigel Farage coming up in eight minutes.
[01:27:14.581 --> 01:27:23.547]  I apologize to Bob Chapman for having him run over by Tucker, but that interview was kind of not timed right because so much is going on.
[01:27:23.848 --> 01:27:27.710]  But I know bobchapmanoftheinternationalforecaster.com understands.
[01:27:27.730 --> 01:27:31.373]  Go there, get a free copy of The Forecaster, and of course we'll have a full hour with him next week.
[01:27:31.973 --> 01:27:33.114]  You were trying to finish up.
[01:27:33.354 --> 01:27:35.015]  The banking collapse is taking place.
[01:27:35.115 --> 01:27:35.996]  They've also been caught
[01:27:36.616 --> 01:27:38.777]  Well, the take is exactly as you described it.
[01:27:38.797 --> 01:27:39.437]  They're falsifying the data.
[01:27:39.477 --> 01:27:41.737]  It's just another way of doing it.
[01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:44.278]  I have a piece in Tomorrow's Issue which describes
[01:28:06.744 --> 01:28:24.072]  How dreadful the figures that were just released are, and most people don't realize it because they don't follow the intricacies of how those figures are made up that go into the employment report.
[01:28:24.652 --> 01:28:29.515]  But they were bad, and that's being reflected.
[01:28:29.555 --> 01:28:32.096]  The Dow is down right now 315 points, and it's going to get worse.
[01:28:34.778 --> 01:28:40.959]  And it's on low volume, which tells you that it'll probably go down rather quickly from here.
[01:28:41.039 --> 01:28:41.539]  It's below 10,000.
[01:28:41.839 --> 01:28:46.880]  The whole thing is a masquerade in employment.
[01:28:48.041 --> 01:28:52.861]  The recovery, whatever there was of a recovery, is over.
[01:28:53.802 --> 01:28:54.902]  We're on our way down.
[01:28:55.062 --> 01:29:01.063]  Otherwise, Larry Summers the other day wouldn't have asked for $200 billion and the legislature passed.
[01:29:01.993 --> 01:29:04.854]  A 73 billion extension of unemployment benefits.
[01:29:05.635 --> 01:29:07.255]  They're looking for 500 billion.
[01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:10.897]  They're looking for the Fed to come in with another trillion and a half.
[01:29:12.337 --> 01:29:19.100]  The economy cannot continue to go even sideways without that kind of infusion.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.461]  And they're going to have to come up with it.
[01:29:21.561 --> 01:29:22.441]  And what's going to happen?
[01:29:22.781 --> 01:29:25.142]  We're going to have eventually hyperinflation.
[01:29:26.011 --> 01:29:27.172]  First, more inflation.
[01:29:27.192 --> 01:29:29.373]  They're going to have to admit to, too.
[01:29:29.633 --> 01:29:33.015]  Not the real figures, but they'll have to admit to it.
[01:29:36.097 --> 01:29:36.397]  Bob?
[01:29:37.798 --> 01:29:45.323]  One of the things I wanted to say was that Jim Tucker and I were together at the Spotlight.
[01:29:45.363 --> 01:29:48.345]  I was a financial editor back when it started.
[01:29:49.245 --> 01:29:51.887]  And now it's the American Free Press.
[01:29:52.627 --> 01:29:53.828]  So we go back a long way.
[01:29:53.848 --> 01:29:55.089]  What were you going to say?
[01:29:56.452 --> 01:29:57.653]  No, you were talking.
[01:29:57.673 --> 01:29:59.455]  I actually suddenly lost audio for a moment.
[01:29:59.535 --> 01:29:59.896]  I'm sorry.
[01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:00.556]  I was interrupting.
[01:30:00.616 --> 01:30:03.079]  It seems like even when I'm trying to not interrupt, I'm hell-bent on it.
[01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:05.381]  But finish up about Jim, the point you were making.
[01:30:06.422 --> 01:30:06.822]  Oh, yeah.
[01:30:06.842 --> 01:30:10.026]  Jim and I, he was the editor of the Spotlight.
[01:30:10.726 --> 01:30:20.356]  And I used to do the financial column along with G. Gordon Tether back in the early days of getting the word out, so to speak.
[01:30:21.347 --> 01:30:25.471]  Is there nothing you haven't done anywhere in the Patriot community?
[01:30:25.491 --> 01:30:26.672]  You've had your hands in it.
[01:30:26.692 --> 01:30:27.213]  That's good.
[01:30:28.554 --> 01:30:32.738]  Well, you know, I saw what was going on.
[01:30:32.938 --> 01:30:34.239]  I understood the problem.
[01:30:34.279 --> 01:30:35.580]  I got outside the box.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.901]  I had been trained well.
[01:30:37.462 --> 01:30:38.683]  I had a great education.
[01:30:38.743 --> 01:30:40.084]  I worked in counterintelligence.
[01:30:40.765 --> 01:30:42.026]  I lived all over the world.
[01:30:42.086 --> 01:30:43.888]  I spoke several languages.
[01:30:44.348 --> 01:30:46.170]  I had everything in the world going for me.
[01:30:46.730 --> 01:30:47.391]  And I used it.
[01:30:48.348 --> 01:30:49.449]  And I'm still using it.
[01:30:49.529 --> 01:30:53.951]  I'm not going to give up until I can't walk or talk anymore.
[01:30:54.051 --> 01:30:57.172]  Well, Bob Chapman, we haven't won this fight, that much is clear.
[01:30:57.672 --> 01:31:00.333]  But you can really see the tide shifting.
[01:31:00.413 --> 01:31:13.899]  And to hear from a Guardian prestigious, that's one of the most prestigious papers in the world, saying he was there as they were kicking people out and saw head security people talking about how horrified they were of me, like I was a hundred foot goblin.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.041]  I mean, that just shows these people are not invincible, Bob.
[01:31:18.302 --> 01:31:21.323]  You know, people not showing up is very telling.
[01:31:22.304 --> 01:31:24.245]  That means that they don't want the exposure.
[01:31:24.265 --> 01:31:28.646]  They are undecided whether their program for world government is going to work.
[01:31:28.706 --> 01:31:31.087]  Some of them have already admitted that it's not.
[01:31:31.287 --> 01:31:32.508]  And Brzezinski is one of them.
[01:31:33.368 --> 01:31:36.910]  He knows they've got to have war in order to just survive.
[01:31:38.107 --> 01:31:50.521]  And they're not going to survive because if we have a war, and once it's over, we're going to drag all these people up to Nuremberg-type trials and try them just like they did the Nazis.
[01:31:50.701 --> 01:31:53.264]  Powerful, powerful info, Bob Chapman.
[01:31:53.284 --> 01:31:55.407]  We'll talk to you again next Friday, Lord Willen.
[01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:56.448]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:31:57.429 --> 01:31:58.110]  Okay, bye-bye.
[01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:03.505]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.905 --> 01:32:08.870]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.231 --> 01:32:10.973]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.273 --> 01:32:16.098]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.278 --> 01:32:17.239]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.479 --> 01:32:18.220]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.601 --> 01:32:20.202]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.483 --> 01:32:21.303]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.544 --> 01:32:23.566]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.746 --> 01:32:24.847]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.067 --> 01:32:26.408]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.608 --> 01:32:31.671]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:35.053]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.453 --> 01:32:38.915]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.275 --> 01:32:40.256]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.497 --> 01:32:41.097]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.398 --> 01:32:42.299]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.499 --> 01:32:43.220]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.301]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.521 --> 01:32:47.284]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:34:04.334 --> 01:34:07.076]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:34:07.556 --> 01:34:12.299]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:34:12.639 --> 01:34:16.842]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:34:17.162 --> 01:34:19.485]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:34:19.505 --> 01:34:22.048]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:34:22.388 --> 01:34:24.951]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:34:25.311 --> 01:34:32.920]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:34:33.246 --> 01:34:38.589]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:41.430]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:44.912]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:34:45.172 --> 01:34:46.072]  And I got news for you.
[01:34:46.232 --> 01:34:47.553]  You're everyone else.
[01:34:47.573 --> 01:34:48.694]  Invisible Empire.

[01:35:01.024 --> 01:35:06.093]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:06.453 --> 01:35:08.737]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:35:10.345 --> 01:35:17.169]  Well, Nigel Fudge, the former head of the UK Independence Party, the fastest growing party in the UK, member of the European Parliament.
[01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:24.032]  He ran for the UK Parliament and barely lost against the Speaker position.
[01:35:24.792 --> 01:35:30.876]  And on the day of the election, his aircrafts tipped end over end, nearly killing him and the pilot.
[01:35:32.096 --> 01:35:42.301]  And we were just talking during the break, this is his first interview, and he'd also just coinciding his book is now published, it's now available on Amazon.com, it's Fighting Bull.
[01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:46.984]  You know, the Fighting Toro, Nigel Farish, Fighting Bull.
[01:35:47.004 --> 01:35:50.786]  That's him with a bullhorn on the front with the...
[01:35:51.826 --> 01:35:53.547]  With the British flag.
[01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:56.568]  Union Jack, I guess, as an umbrella over his shoulder.
[01:35:57.049 --> 01:35:58.049]  Nigel Farage.
[01:35:58.129 --> 01:36:00.811]  Farage spelled F-A-R-A-G-E.
[01:36:01.031 --> 01:36:02.392]  Fighting Bull.
[01:36:02.472 --> 01:36:03.052]  Great name.
[01:36:03.612 --> 01:36:11.596]  And how he's taking on the globalists, the unelected Eurocrats that now make 70 plus percent of the laws in the UK.
[01:36:12.017 --> 01:36:14.138]  Our fight against the New World Order is ongoing.
[01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:17.239]  Mr. Farage, it is great to have you here, sir.
[01:36:17.279 --> 01:36:18.360]  You've got nine lives.
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:19.961]  Just amazing.
[01:36:20.982 --> 01:36:34.431]  Anybody listening to this that sees the pictures of the crash, which I'm sure you can get and put up on your site, and these incredible photographs of me lying in the wreckage of this light aircraft crash, and you'd have thought for all the world I'd be dead.
[01:36:34.451 --> 01:36:40.195]  And whilst I've been badly injured, it really has been the most miraculous escape it really has.
[01:36:40.816 --> 01:36:49.829]  Folks are wondering, I know you've got a stiff upper lip and don't want to talk about yourself, but the pilot, how he's doing, and what your injuries were.
[01:36:50.711 --> 01:36:53.893]  Well, the pilot was a former Royal Air Force trained pilot.
[01:36:53.973 --> 01:36:55.633]  So, you know, no cowboy.
[01:36:55.653 --> 01:36:57.814]  I mean, you know, a proper chap.
[01:36:57.914 --> 01:36:59.635]  It was a genuine accident in life.
[01:36:59.835 --> 01:37:00.616]  Accidents happen.
[01:37:00.656 --> 01:37:02.737]  You can't insulate yourself against this.
[01:37:02.757 --> 01:37:09.920]  He, I mean, we, you know, when you have an impact injury, such as we had, lots of unpleasant things happen.
[01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:10.581]  And
[01:37:11.801 --> 01:37:12.301]  Yeah, I think.
[01:37:27.547 --> 01:37:28.929]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:37:47.050 --> 01:37:55.025]  If those awful, ghastly Eurocrats that want to take over my country and destroy our democracy think they've got rid of me, they've got another thing coming.
[01:37:55.045 --> 01:37:58.432]  Because it may take me a few months to get better, but I'm going to be back fighting them.
[01:37:59.056 --> 01:38:08.058]  Absolutely, and I was saying, you're such a champion of liberty, we'll just stick you in a Darth Vader iron lung and roll you out against the enemy.
[01:38:08.658 --> 01:38:23.500]  I'm going to be back, and one of the really interesting things, since I had this accident, is the one great prediction that I've had over the years was that this attempt to take countries like Greece and Germany and to force them together in a single monetary unit.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.241]  I've been saying for over ten years that it wouldn't work.
[01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:30.644]  And by the way, to interrupt, and I'm going to give you the floor, sir, in the time we have.
[01:38:44.295 --> 01:38:46.876]  You, giving speeches two years ago, predicted all of this.
[01:38:46.956 --> 01:38:53.659]  You, just a few months ago, excoriated Herman Van Rompuy, the unelected dictator, openly calling for world government.
[01:38:54.139 --> 01:38:56.520]  And now their arrogance has evaporated.
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:03.904]  The London Guardian reported that the Bilderberg Group has said that they're afraid of protesters and afraid of me by name.
[01:39:04.524 --> 01:39:08.266]  So they're just horrified that the public is now identifying them.
[01:39:08.326 --> 01:39:13.428]  So how did you predict all this, A, and then B, go into the state of Europe right now?
[01:39:13.928 --> 01:39:18.251]  Well, before I was in politics, I had a job in the real world.
[01:39:18.932 --> 01:39:26.458]  For 20 years, I worked on the foreign exchange and commodity markets, so I have some idea of how the global economy actually works.
[01:39:27.118 --> 01:39:30.181]  And it really exists, Alex, because things are different.
[01:39:30.925 --> 01:39:32.466]  You know, things are different.
[01:39:32.546 --> 01:39:41.190]  Individual countries have their own currency, they have their own interest rates, and they're able to adapt and adjust to changing global markets and changing conditions.
[01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:48.093]  When you try and pretend, as part of your attempt at firstly European government, but leading on to global government,
[01:39:48.553 --> 01:39:51.674]  That actually we're all the same and that we can all come under the same umbrella.
[01:39:52.114 --> 01:39:54.635]  You know, all of my experience told me that it couldn't work.
[01:39:55.075 --> 01:40:04.838]  Everything told me that the German economy was a different economy to the Greek economy and that those guys joining together in a monetary union 10 years ago couldn't work.
[01:40:04.858 --> 01:40:11.580]  So I've been predicting disaster consistently over the course of the last 10 years and now it really is happening.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:13.020]  And if ever there was an example
[01:40:13.766 --> 01:40:23.930]  Of why bureaucratic control, of why people who've got their dreams and their plans, just like the communists of course, let's not forget, because they operated on exactly the same basis.
[01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:31.594]  If ever there was an example of why this is mad, bad, dangerous and will lead to civil war, you're seeing it in Europe right now.
[01:40:33.089 --> 01:40:34.971]  Yeah, a bunch of unelected bureaucrats.
[01:40:34.991 --> 01:40:38.494]  For those that don't know, they're exempt from their own EU taxes.
[01:40:39.635 --> 01:40:53.068]  Briefly explain, I mean, as if you're talking to six-year-olds, I mean, you know, for me, because I want it simply, how you have an elected parliament, but it is a ceremonial vassal to the bureaucracy that has the real power.
[01:40:53.528 --> 01:41:22.655]  Oh yeah, I mean, you know, the Palace of Westminster, and I know that you guys in the States often watch our Prime Minister's Questions, and you see this magnificent Gothic building, and just a couple of weeks ago the Queen arrived in her carriage to open Parliament, and it all looks magnificent, and the relationship between the monarch and the Parliament, it all goes back to the English Civil War, and it's something that has been the envy of the world in many ways, and yet the reality is, the whole thing is now a total charade.
[01:41:23.215 --> 01:41:27.657]  Because what we've got in Westminster is nothing more than a local government.
[01:41:27.737 --> 01:41:31.238]  I mean, think of it as a county type of government.
[01:41:31.558 --> 01:41:42.942]  Because the big decisions that affect the British economy, the big decisions that affect our lives, employment legislation, environmental legislation, health and safety, I mean, you name it, the list goes on, it's as long as your arm.
[01:41:43.482 --> 01:41:47.023]  All of those things are now decided by the European Union.
[01:41:47.523 --> 01:41:49.544]  Those laws are made in secret.
[01:41:50.064 --> 01:42:17.891]  By an unelected bureaucracy that is called the European Commission, and we the voters have no means of putting them in place, we have no means of removing them, and this coup d'etat, because that's what it is, this coup d'etat of British democracy has happened slowly, surreptitiously, over the course of the last 40 years, by people whose intention it was to form a European government, a greater Europe, and it is a first step
[01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:20.212]  We're good to go.
[01:42:38.733 --> 01:42:41.375]  Genuinely believe that they know what's best for us.
[01:42:41.876 --> 01:42:46.960]  Genuinely believe in this concept of global government and it will be a disaster.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.303]  And that's why I gave up a career in business to fight against it.
[01:42:50.843 --> 01:42:51.504]  Well we commend you.
[01:42:51.524 --> 01:42:55.527]  We've got about five minutes left in this segment and then five minutes after that before you've got to leave us.
[01:42:55.567 --> 01:43:02.032]  We want to be respectful of your time and also your strength recovering from the near-death experience you had in that airplane crash.
[01:43:02.653 --> 01:43:06.896]  And it's a blessing that you and the pilots survived to get back to the collapse of Europe.
[01:43:07.677 --> 01:43:27.054]  I mean, it is collapsing, and the intel we just got from Jim Tucker, who's always spot on, I mean, you could set your watch and warrant by him, is that they are panicking, they're not even sure they can have world government now, they say their carbon tax is basically dead, and that many of them, for the first time in 60-plus years, did not attend.
[01:43:27.314 --> 01:43:29.136]  So it appears they are now being routed.
[01:43:29.966 --> 01:43:30.586]  Yes, they are.
[01:43:30.606 --> 01:43:34.087]  I mean, you know, their dreams are falling to pieces.
[01:43:34.587 --> 01:43:43.329]  Whether it's the single currency union, whether it's the, you know, the whole global warming carbon tax scam, because scam is the only word that's appropriate for it.
[01:43:43.989 --> 01:43:51.210]  The whole thing is failing, it's losing public support massively with the day, and it doesn't work in practical terms.
[01:43:51.611 --> 01:43:53.751]  But, you know, let's not be complacent about this.
[01:43:54.514 --> 01:43:57.555]  Just because their plans are failing doesn't mean they're going to stop.
[01:43:57.755 --> 01:44:11.620]  And my fear is that what they're going to do now is they're going to move down a route of suppressing free speech, of censuring and maybe ultimately even imprisoning those who challenge them and fight them.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:18.762]  I mean, the last time, Alex, I came on with you, we talked about my discussion that I had with Herman Van Rompuy.
[01:44:19.474 --> 01:44:20.215]  You were censured!
[01:44:44.356 --> 01:44:48.599]  I was censured and I was fined, absolutely, told this would never happen again.
[01:44:48.879 --> 01:44:58.686]  So what they'll do, as the edifice collapses, what they will do is they will become even less democratic and even more vicious against those that dare to speak out against them.
[01:44:58.866 --> 01:45:02.209]  You know, this battle is far from won just because their dreams are failing.
[01:45:03.032 --> 01:45:03.612]  Absolutely.
[01:45:03.632 --> 01:45:04.753]  They're announcing in the U.S.
[01:45:04.793 --> 01:45:06.594]  that they now want to restrict the Internet.
[01:45:06.915 --> 01:45:08.336]  They want to restrict talk radio.
[01:45:08.416 --> 01:45:09.596]  It's now in the news.
[01:45:09.997 --> 01:45:12.358]  They're now proposing, and I see the same things in Europe.
[01:45:12.718 --> 01:45:18.162]  I mean, they can't beat us in the realm of ideas, so they're going to try to just shut us up and put us in the tower.
[01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:21.046]  Absolutely, that is entirely right.
[01:45:21.086 --> 01:45:34.066]  And I have to say that looking at Obama from this side of the water, and I've felt this ever since he was elected, you know, I really genuinely think that you have got a very dangerous president indeed.
[01:45:34.582 --> 01:45:35.282]  Oh, I agree.
[01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:39.383]  He has got a cult following, though he's only got a 40% approval rating now.
[01:45:39.764 --> 01:45:48.266]  That group is getting more... It's almost like as Germany was collapsing and the most hardcore Nazis were supporting Hitler, they just didn't care.
[01:45:48.286 --> 01:45:49.586]  They were going to support him until the end.
[01:45:49.887 --> 01:45:51.407]  Yeah.
[01:45:51.487 --> 01:45:58.509]  I'm constantly struck that there are these similarities between what's happening here and what is beginning to happen in America.
[01:45:58.669 --> 01:46:01.230]  And people have got to start waking up.
[01:46:01.690 --> 01:46:02.971]  What about the British people?
[01:46:03.011 --> 01:46:07.554]  I mean, I know that you say both parties are, you know, the big main parties are controlled, and they certainly are.
[01:46:07.855 --> 01:46:11.618]  Mr. Cameron's a Bilderberg, Stooley, Minion.
[01:46:12.458 --> 01:46:18.343]  But, I mean, at least the fact that they threw out Brown shows that they're wanting change.
[01:46:19.158 --> 01:46:27.480]  Well it does show they want change, but what we've finished up here with in Britain is a very floppy coalition government.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:37.843]  Cameron's Conservatives are in bed now with the most Euro-fanatical, most anti-democratic Liberal Democrat party.
[01:46:37.943 --> 01:46:41.264]  So whilst we've got rid of Brown, I'm afraid things ain't no better.
[01:46:41.943 --> 01:46:45.746]  Because now people have got to have time to wake up to the fact that he's running a con on them.
[01:46:46.427 --> 01:46:54.013]  Let's come back and talk more about the future of Europe and how you see England responding as Europe collapses.
[01:46:55.194 --> 01:46:59.117]  Nigel Farage is our guest, member of the UK Independence Party, former leader.
[01:47:01.039 --> 01:47:03.360]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:05.621]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:47:05.741 --> 01:47:08.563]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:47:08.963 --> 01:47:13.705]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:47:14.065 --> 01:47:18.247]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:47:18.567 --> 01:47:20.888]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:47:20.908 --> 01:47:23.429]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:47:23.449 --> 01:47:26.350]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:47:26.711 --> 01:47:34.314]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:47:34.657 --> 01:47:39.900]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.321]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:47:42.361 --> 01:47:46.323]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:47:46.583 --> 01:47:47.503]  And I got news for you.
[01:47:47.664 --> 01:47:48.944]  You're everyone else.

[01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:01.310]  Fatigue.
[01:48:01.831 --> 01:48:02.271]  Headaches.
[01:48:02.944 --> 01:48:03.925]  Allergies and asthma.
[01:48:04.265 --> 01:48:05.166]  Chronic disease.
[01:48:05.707 --> 01:48:07.108]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:48:07.548 --> 01:48:08.149]  Here's a fact.
[01:48:08.489 --> 01:48:16.156]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.

[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:38.240]  Yeah.
[01:49:00.134 --> 01:49:02.236]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:49:02.436 --> 01:49:02.716]  June 4th, 2010.
[01:49:02.756 --> 01:49:03.677]  Gold opened this morning at $12.0460.
[01:49:03.717 --> 01:49:07.319]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.3685, $6.1843 for a half-ounce, or $3.0921 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:49:07.379 --> 01:49:07.840]  That's $12.3685, $6.1843, or $3.0921.
[01:49:19.768 --> 01:49:22.430]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[01:49:22.691 --> 01:49:26.614]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[01:49:26.934 --> 01:49:31.558]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:49:31.818 --> 01:49:35.321]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[01:49:35.582 --> 01:49:40.326]  Discussing costs, benefits, risks, the book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:49:43.348 --> 01:49:46.552]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[01:49:46.793 --> 01:49:50.657]  Discover how gold can be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:49:50.677 --> 01:49:52.700]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, this book is free.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:52.940]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:50:01.164 --> 01:50:03.765]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:50:04.165 --> 01:50:09.148]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:50:09.508 --> 01:50:11.229]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:50:11.549 --> 01:50:16.311]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:50:16.531 --> 01:50:17.491]  How much do you want?
[01:50:17.732 --> 01:50:18.472]  When do you want it?
[01:50:18.852 --> 01:50:20.453]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:50:20.733 --> 01:50:21.553]  When will you need it?
[01:50:21.813 --> 01:50:23.874]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:50:24.014 --> 01:50:25.094]  Will there be any food?
[01:50:25.335 --> 01:50:26.675]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:50:26.875 --> 01:50:31.937]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:50:32.137 --> 01:50:34.078]  You wipe out all these problems if you
[01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.909]  We're good.
[01:51:05.962 --> 01:51:12.030]  Nigel Farage, looking at the political landscape, I was talking during the break, I said, what do you think is most important?
[01:51:12.110 --> 01:51:15.614]  And you said, well, people think they've elected Mr. Cameron and gotten a change.
[01:51:15.634 --> 01:51:17.317]  They need to understand it's controlled change.
[01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:19.900]  They need to elect truly independent parties.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.722]  And you see, you're the UK Independent Party.
[01:51:22.483 --> 01:51:27.466]  Really surging and growing and being ignored by the media and demonized when they do cover it.
[01:51:27.486 --> 01:51:28.467]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:51:28.907 --> 01:51:33.090]  Now every incumbent in the primaries, every incumbent is being defeated.
[01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:35.411]  Every establishment candidate is being defeated.
[01:51:35.451 --> 01:51:36.332]  So it does look like
[01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:45.953]  The awakening's happening, and I think as soon as people figure out that things could stay just as bad with Cameron, just like with Obama from Bush, there's going to be a very fast wake-up here.
[01:51:46.353 --> 01:51:47.434]  Can you give us your take on that?
[01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:48.674]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:51:48.714 --> 01:51:53.776]  I mean, look, you know, millions of people are hopeful that Cameron somehow is going to be different.
[01:51:54.176 --> 01:52:00.518]  But, you know, the penny's going to drop, and they're going to realize that actually they've got somebody that looks different, sounds different, appears to be more reasonable.
[01:52:00.818 --> 01:52:03.759]  But the reality is we have surrendered our sovereignty.
[01:52:03.819 --> 01:52:06.100]  We have given away our ability to govern ourselves.
[01:52:06.801 --> 01:52:07.101]  I don't
[01:52:22.861 --> 01:52:28.344]  I don't see the Republican Party actually offering any proper opposition to Obama.
[01:52:28.724 --> 01:52:30.244]  So start seeking alternatives.
[01:52:30.264 --> 01:52:34.026]  Start seeking candidates that have actually got the courage to stand up for democracy.
[01:52:34.346 --> 01:52:40.989]  At the end of the day, you know, what this really comes down to, it's a battle of democracy versus bureaucracy.
[01:52:41.409 --> 01:52:42.610]  And the global governments
[01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:44.353]  They don't believe in democracy.
[01:52:44.693 --> 01:52:46.136]  They believe that they know best.
[01:52:46.516 --> 01:52:48.299]  They don't want the voters to change things.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.702]  And that's the great battle.
[01:52:50.122 --> 01:52:56.313]  And I think we should really take heart, because people are, all across the Western world, waking up to what's being done to them.
[01:52:58.874 --> 01:53:00.636]  And that's why the system is scared.
[01:53:00.816 --> 01:53:02.297]  You probably haven't had a chance to see it.
[01:53:02.317 --> 01:53:05.079]  I don't like to talk about myself here, but this is such great news.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:11.645]  Zbigniew Brzezinski two weeks, three weeks ago said to the CFR, for the first time the entire world is awake.
[01:53:12.186 --> 01:53:13.567]  Our world government's in trouble.
[01:53:14.247 --> 01:53:16.690]  And now Bilderberg, a reporter for The Guardian,
[01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:20.412]  He, by the way, went for the first time last year making fun of us.
[01:53:20.472 --> 01:53:21.533]  Now he knows how real it is.
[01:53:22.033 --> 01:53:30.740]  He was there when they shut it down and closed it, and he overheard at dinner the main Bilderberg managers, the Minions, before they arrived, talking about, oh, these horrible protesters.
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:34.923]  Oh, that Alex Jones bull horned us in Canada and in the U.S.
[01:53:35.264 --> 01:53:36.324]  It's so scary.
[01:53:36.384 --> 01:53:37.425]  Will they attack?
[01:53:38.166 --> 01:53:43.350]  And they sound like addled children who aren't connected to the real world.
[01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:51.137]  I'm reminded of George Bush Senior on TV, 10 years after they were adopted, not knowing what a food checkout scanner is.
[01:53:51.197 --> 01:53:59.305]  But, you know, listening to these quotes he was writing down, they sound like, you know, almost these glow-in-the-dark people that can't even feed themselves.
[01:53:59.505 --> 01:54:01.526]  No, I mean, listen Alex, of course they're scared of you.
[01:54:01.546 --> 01:54:06.527]  And they've been scared, I must say, you know, in Britain and in the EU, they've been scared of me for many, many years.
[01:54:06.888 --> 01:54:09.268]  And this is the reason I've written this book, Fighting Bull.
[01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:15.931]  I've chronicled how they've tried to put obstacles in my path, how they've used the black arts against me for over a decade.
[01:54:16.691 --> 01:54:23.013]  They've done everything they can to rubbish me, to label me as an extremist, to try and keep me off the media.
[01:54:23.573 --> 01:54:27.475]  They've tried to do all these things because they're terrified of the arguments, because they know.
[01:54:28.075 --> 01:54:35.462]  But in their hearts, most people, most of us who live in the Western world, are tax-paying, law-abiding, decent people.
[01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:39.406]  And when we realise what has been done in our name, we will rebel against it.
[01:54:39.506 --> 01:54:41.507]  And, you know, we've just got to keep fighting.
[01:54:41.788 --> 01:54:42.809]  We've got to keep fighting.
[01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:44.871]  We know we've got right on our side.
[01:54:45.231 --> 01:54:49.515]  We know that in the end, democracy is a thing that will always triumph.
[01:54:49.895 --> 01:54:52.798]  We know that every time in the past there have been these experiments,
[01:54:53.138 --> 01:54:58.382]  Whether it's communism, European federalism, or global government, it does not work.
[01:54:58.502 --> 01:55:00.583]  So, you know, listeners, remember that.
[01:55:00.964 --> 01:55:05.007]  Bad though things are, be optimistic, don't give up, and keep fighting.
[01:55:11.411 --> 01:55:16.517]  I mean, we're just normal, nice people that want freedom and sovereignty, and they're scared to death of us.
[01:55:16.797 --> 01:55:18.038]  They're scared to death of you.
[01:55:18.819 --> 01:55:25.606]  They are horrified that people are now testifying before the European Union Parliament about the world government.
[01:55:25.666 --> 01:55:30.612]  I mean, it shows that they're not invincible, that they are human as well.
[01:55:31.112 --> 01:55:33.833]  Well, it does, and I'll just give you a little example.
[01:55:33.853 --> 01:55:35.214]  Global warming.
[01:55:35.514 --> 01:55:37.535]  The whole hysteria over global warming.
[01:55:37.855 --> 01:55:51.420]  Two weeks ago, Lord Monckton, Christopher Monckton, who's been on your programme before, and who was a luminary in the UK Independence Party, Monckton won a debate at the Oxford University Union the other week on the question of global warming.
[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:56.842]  Two years ago, for the young audience who'd been brainwashed, that would have been unthinkable.
[01:55:57.722 --> 01:55:59.304]  Completely unthinkable.
[01:55:59.665 --> 01:56:05.212]  And it just shows that through the efforts of all of us to make the arguments, to connect with the people, we're beginning to win.
[01:56:06.312 --> 01:56:16.459]  If you just have right on your side, as the Texas Ranger founder said, that a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right, if the man in the right keeps on a coming.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:31.809]  But I think it's well taken what you said, Nigel Farage, one of the founding members of the UK Independence Party, former leader of it, European Union member of Parliament, author of the new book that's out, that they're going to strike back though.
[01:56:31.849 --> 01:56:33.290]  The empire is going to strike back.
[01:56:33.791 --> 01:56:35.152]  Give us the name of your book one more time.
[01:56:35.792 --> 01:56:38.494]  I am the fighting bull of British politics.
[01:56:38.574 --> 01:56:40.315]  I'm the fighting bull of European politics.
[01:56:40.635 --> 01:56:41.195]  And you know what?
[01:56:41.435 --> 01:56:43.076]  A plane crash isn't going to stop me.
[01:56:43.536 --> 01:56:44.537]  God bless you, sir.
[01:56:44.637 --> 01:56:46.398]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:56:46.418 --> 01:56:49.459]  We'll be right back from Bilderberg 2010 in Spain.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:51.881]  We're on the march.
[01:56:52.341 --> 01:56:53.962]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:54.882 --> 01:56:57.584]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:00.401 --> 01:57:02.023]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:57:02.063 --> 01:57:04.845]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:57:05.426 --> 01:57:10.351]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:57:10.651 --> 01:57:13.814]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[01:57:14.074 --> 01:57:16.416]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:57:17.057 --> 01:57:17.918]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.521]  Take my word for it.
[01:57:21.721 --> 01:57:24.043]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:57:24.364 --> 01:57:30.589]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:57:30.889 --> 01:57:32.291]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:57:36.094 --> 01:57:37.435]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[01:57:40.703 --> 01:57:47.952]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W Dirtback.
[01:57:48.633 --> 01:57:53.699]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[01:57:53.759 --> 01:57:54.200]  Thank you!
[01:58:00.134 --> 01:58:04.998]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:58:05.118 --> 01:58:05.878]  What have we got?
[01:58:06.098 --> 01:58:08.240]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:09.261]  A republic.
[01:58:09.561 --> 01:58:12.143]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:58:12.203 --> 01:58:14.124]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:58:14.485 --> 01:58:16.386]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:58:16.486 --> 01:58:17.767]  So they think they own our land?
[01:58:18.167 --> 01:58:19.308]  They think they own our water?
[01:58:19.488 --> 01:58:19.909]  Children?
[01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:20.889]  Our education?
[01:58:21.230 --> 01:58:21.830]  Our money?
[01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:25.713]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:58:26.073 --> 01:58:29.717]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:58:31.039 --> 01:58:31.860]  We have the facts.
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:33.181]  We have the Constitution.
[01:58:33.221 --> 01:58:34.103]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:58:34.143 --> 01:58:34.964]  We have common law.
[01:58:35.024 --> 01:58:37.266]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:37.547 --> 01:58:41.311]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:58:41.411 --> 01:58:46.217]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:58:46.377 --> 01:58:47.739]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:58:47.879 --> 01:58:48.721]  Don't tread on me.
[01:58:48.961 --> 01:58:55.830]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:01.890]  Does everybody call a contractor now?
[01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:04.551]  No, they say, I'm going to run to Home Depot and price some tile there.
[01:59:04.671 --> 01:59:05.511]  Hey, it's MZ.
[01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:10.052]  That's the beginning of an inspiring and masterful health lecture by Dr. Joel Wallach.
[01:59:10.192 --> 01:59:16.754]  Like Alex Jones, Doc has been subject to ridicule by mainstream forces just for telling the truth.
[01:59:17.074 --> 01:59:19.535]  Everyone needs to hear the Deadly Recipes lecture.
[01:59:19.695 --> 01:59:28.097]  Listen to it in full at DeadlyRecipes.com and please help us spread the message of the real and simple way to fix health care in America.
[01:59:28.217 --> 01:59:28.617]  Remember,
[01:59:28.897 --> 01:59:31.860]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:36.424]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:59:36.604 --> 01:59:42.330]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:59:42.410 --> 01:59:45.793]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:59:46.033 --> 01:59:48.655]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:59:48.755 --> 01:59:53.679]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:59:53.819 --> 01:59:54.119]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:59:54.139 --> 01:59:55.460]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:00:15.627 --> 02:00:19.969]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's bigger than the victory at Trenton, what's happening right now.
[02:00:20.509 --> 02:00:25.391]  George Washington losing scores of battles but winning that key battle.
[02:00:26.392 --> 02:00:30.594]  They understood the enemy wasn't invincible and it was their perseverance that won the war.
[02:00:33.095 --> 02:00:40.098]  And I am so excited to be here and to be able to announce to all of you that
[02:00:41.857 --> 02:00:44.098]  We are so close to bringing down the New World Order.
[02:00:44.678 --> 02:00:47.700]  They have organized the collapse, but it's getting even out of their control.
[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:49.020]  They are being identified.
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:51.081]  They are internally scared.
[02:00:51.822 --> 02:00:53.202]  They are internally upset.
[02:00:53.302 --> 02:00:55.523]  I mean, I can go on... Here's an example.
[02:00:55.663 --> 02:00:58.645]  I go on British Radio every few weeks, local radio, national radio.
[02:00:58.705 --> 02:01:05.168]  I was on Talk Sport, the largest, most listened to private radio network in England.
[02:01:05.948 --> 02:01:09.609]  When it goes into Scotland and the continent of Europe, every caller agreed with me.
[02:01:09.769 --> 02:01:11.730]  I was on for over an hour, about 70 minutes.
[02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:13.570]  The host agreed with me.
[02:01:13.590 --> 02:01:20.012]  And I've been going on that station since it started probably ten years ago, nine, ten years ago.
[02:01:20.032 --> 02:01:22.453]  And it was the opposite ten years ago.
[02:01:23.413 --> 02:01:27.995]  And it's the same thing here in the United States, because everything we talk about has come true and is out in the open.
[02:01:28.635 --> 02:01:29.595]  We've done the research.
[02:01:29.655 --> 02:01:30.896]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:01:32.881 --> 02:01:47.513]  The public is finally facing issues, and they're going to face the fact that these globalists are so evil that they are genetically modifying the food to sterilize us, that's now coming out, that that is their agenda, and that it's worse than even the public thinks.
[02:01:47.934 --> 02:01:51.096]  I've been through this wake-up process in the last 17-18 years.
[02:01:51.116 --> 02:02:00.644]  I really woke up about 17-18 years ago in high school as a senior, got politically active 15 years ago in the middle of college,
[02:02:01.864 --> 02:02:07.429]  And, uh, I mean, I remember hearing the old-timers say they want a world government to exterminate us.
[02:02:07.729 --> 02:02:09.530]  And you'd say, oh, shut up, old man.
[02:02:09.991 --> 02:02:11.352]  And then you actually get the documents.
[02:02:11.412 --> 02:02:14.274]  These are not dumb old men that were saying all this.
[02:02:14.815 --> 02:02:15.875]  They were right about it all.
[02:02:17.256 --> 02:02:22.761]  And, yeah, I mean, I understand, folks, you know, as the king of, quote, conspiracy theories, I'm not.
[02:02:22.801 --> 02:02:27.365]  I'm the king of facts here and reaching out to people and taking action.
[02:02:28.686 --> 02:02:30.107]  I mean, all I've done is my duty.
[02:02:33.416 --> 02:02:37.680]  And other people have emulated what I've done and taken it to even higher levels.
[02:02:39.621 --> 02:02:40.622]  And we've trailblazed.
[02:02:40.902 --> 02:02:42.283]  But we don't have time to screw around.
[02:02:42.323 --> 02:02:44.005]  They are going to start wars very soon.
[02:02:44.285 --> 02:02:44.846]  You watch.
[02:02:45.786 --> 02:02:48.789]  Every one of our expert guests who's got their finger on the pulse agrees.
[02:02:48.929 --> 02:02:50.450]  I can see it.
[02:02:50.610 --> 02:02:52.632]  They're at their most dangerous.
[02:02:52.672 --> 02:02:53.533]  But I've always said this.
[02:02:54.273 --> 02:02:55.575]  It's better to force them
[02:02:57.284 --> 02:03:01.265]  To have to carry out their agenda than to let them do it their way and take their time.
[02:03:01.385 --> 02:03:06.586]  It's better to go head up against them because then we got a chance of beating them.
[02:03:06.706 --> 02:03:09.166]  If we don't resist them, they're going to win for sure.
[02:03:10.227 --> 02:03:21.469]  And you know, they can't stand the spirit of people that just say, you know what, kill me, put me in prison, destroy my name, lie about me, have your COINTELPRO operators pose as patriots and attack me from a thousand sides.
[02:03:22.029 --> 02:03:26.150]  It doesn't matter what you do, I'm going to sacrifice my name, who I am in this,
[02:03:26.770 --> 02:03:28.551]  I am a kamikaze in the info war.
[02:03:29.591 --> 02:03:30.151]  A torpedo.
[02:03:31.371 --> 02:03:33.932]  And when you've got that commitment, you can't be stopped, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:34.632 --> 02:03:37.393]  And they can't stand it that we aren't going to back off.
[02:03:37.993 --> 02:03:39.154]  We aren't going to turn around.
[02:03:39.794 --> 02:03:45.276]  It's like a game of chicken with two giant speed trains, and we can't get off the tracks.
[02:03:45.436 --> 02:03:46.796]  I mean, I'm not going to turn.
[02:03:47.296 --> 02:03:48.277]  I'm not going to give up.
[02:03:48.517 --> 02:03:52.258]  Because my goal in this mission is not to make it out of this.
[02:03:53.198 --> 02:03:55.140]  If I do, that's gravy.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:56.461]  That's a gift from God.
[02:03:57.182 --> 02:03:58.863]  I don't say prayers every night.
[02:03:58.904 --> 02:04:00.665]  And again, I'm not up here on a high horse for us.
[02:04:01.206 --> 02:04:02.207]  I'm not up here on a high horse.
[02:04:02.307 --> 02:04:03.768]  I'm telling you where I come from.
[02:04:04.108 --> 02:04:06.330]  I don't say prayers at night like, God, give me this.
[02:04:06.491 --> 02:04:07.411]  Oh, God, protect me.
[02:04:07.492 --> 02:04:08.392]  God, do this and that.
[02:04:09.332 --> 02:04:11.273]  Sometimes I pray, please protect me if that's your will.
[02:04:11.714 --> 02:04:20.359]  I just ask God, help me to be a good person, help me to be articulate, help me to be focused, help me to be strong, please give me the energy and focus, you know, please.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:24.302]  It's upsetting knowing all this stuff, you know, please.
[02:04:25.243 --> 02:04:30.086]  And God has just blessed me to a level I couldn't imagine and protected us and my family.
[02:04:31.347 --> 02:04:35.970]  And I have selfishly a few times said, look, let them, let them do anything they want to me.
[02:04:36.630 --> 02:04:37.971]  Just please protect my family.
[02:04:41.528 --> 02:04:44.152]  But the issue is, you've just got to have the attitude you're not giving up.
[02:04:44.192 --> 02:04:49.259]  Now I want to go to Paul Dornanew, who three years ago sent us incredible video and photos.
[02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:55.207]  He's from Romania, but he went to Istanbul, the capital of Turkey.
[02:04:56.328 --> 02:04:56.588]  Thank you.
[02:05:12.678 --> 02:05:18.100]  Uh, and it's infocon.ro, just I-N-F-O-C-O-N dot R-O.
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:23.222]  There's a lot of amazing investigative research and reports, and he does speak pretty good English.
[02:05:23.242 --> 02:05:28.384]  So we're going to go to him in about four minutes, and I appreciate Paul Dornanew from Bilderberg 2010.
[02:05:29.104 --> 02:05:35.707]  We're getting Guardian reporters on, we're getting American Free Press reporters on, we're getting independent reporters from Romania on, these InfoWarriors.
[02:05:36.207 --> 02:05:39.570]  And his photos are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:41.451]  They just went up on Prison Planet minutes ago.
[02:05:41.471 --> 02:05:43.593]  They may not be up on InfoWars yet.
[02:05:43.853 --> 02:05:47.996]  But I briefly wanted to go to Ted Anderson, because you got gold up seven plus dollars today.
[02:05:48.477 --> 02:05:49.358]  Last time I checked.
[02:05:49.378 --> 02:05:50.258]  In fact, let me just look it up.
[02:05:51.119 --> 02:05:53.361]  You've got gold way up.
[02:05:53.461 --> 02:05:56.183]  You've got gold running out in Europe.
[02:05:56.203 --> 02:05:57.944]  A lot of it running out in the U.S.
[02:05:58.245 --> 02:05:59.185]  And it's the weekend.
[02:05:59.285 --> 02:06:03.229]  And Ted told me yesterday, he said, I'm about to run out of the francs.
[02:06:03.789 --> 02:06:10.053]  that are priced in a market that's almost a hundred dollars lower than it is, a fifth of an ounce for two hundred and fifty six dollars a piece.
[02:06:10.093 --> 02:06:11.154]  He's almost out of these.
[02:06:11.714 --> 02:06:16.777]  He's got a few other coins at the old super low price that nobody can match, literally.
[02:06:18.158 --> 02:06:20.820]  And then it'll go up and it's still a great deal.
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:23.902]  So I wanted to bring Ted up briefly on the economy.
[02:06:24.442 --> 02:06:26.664]  The stock market plunging over three hundred points today.
[02:06:27.324 --> 02:06:30.505]  And just to tell people, the brokers will be there to take your order this weekend.
[02:06:30.525 --> 02:06:34.786]  And, you know, they have a lot of other great deals as well, collector coins and everything else.
[02:06:34.826 --> 02:06:40.207]  But specifically, these bullion deals I certify are the best deals I've ever heard of.
[02:06:40.607 --> 02:06:45.509]  The Franks and a few others he's about to offer, the silver half dollars at $9 and something apiece.
[02:06:45.849 --> 02:06:47.329]  These are really smoking hot deals.
[02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:49.129]  Ted Anderson, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:06:49.469 --> 02:06:51.350]  Briefly, tell people about today's coin offers.
[02:06:51.610 --> 02:06:52.210]  Yeah, sure.
[02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:58.473]  Well, right now, the franc is currently at $256.68, which, just like you said, I'm holding that price down.
[02:06:58.893 --> 02:07:08.198]  British sovereigns have sold out because people in Europe are so excited about buying gold with everything falling apart around them that they've just simply bought out what's available in the marketplace.
[02:07:08.578 --> 02:07:10.639]  And the francs are a European coin, too.
[02:07:11.159 --> 02:07:14.141]  So obviously, that's going to be falling under the same pressure.
[02:07:15.201 --> 02:07:22.466]  Right now, the Frank is the best buy at $9.5668, but we do also have the US Eagle and many other things.
[02:07:22.906 --> 02:07:25.187]  If you're into the silver, there's no question about it.
[02:07:25.227 --> 02:07:30.690]  Those walking Liberty Halves, even if you go to the Internet right now, you'll find that they're over $10 a piece.
[02:07:31.231 --> 02:07:34.693]  And right now, I have them at $9.75, so that's really a great buy.
[02:07:35.894 --> 02:07:43.519]  Just, you know, the junk silver, the clean rounds, we call them, all that stuff is a good buy right now, Alex.
[02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:52.266]  Everybody is becoming so familiar and so aware of the fact that the central banks are bailing out the countries.
[02:07:52.286 --> 02:07:54.347]  They talk about one country bailing out another.
[02:07:54.527 --> 02:07:55.568]  Everybody's in trouble.
[02:07:56.009 --> 02:07:57.750]  Nobody's got a surplus of money.
[02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:59.871]  But Ted, you call it a good deal.
[02:08:00.752 --> 02:08:03.874]  No one that I've seen has silver half dollars at the price.
[02:08:03.934 --> 02:08:05.275]  I mean, we're not just saying this.
[02:08:05.355 --> 02:08:06.155]  Look it up, folks.
[02:08:06.595 --> 02:08:11.558]  No one has francs at $200 and $56 apiece that I've seen.
[02:08:11.878 --> 02:08:12.879]  You bought a bunch of this.
[02:08:12.919 --> 02:08:14.160]  You're now about to run out.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.461]  You bought this stuff at almost $100 lower in the market.
[02:08:18.582 --> 02:08:24.525]  And so any amount of tiny markup you had when you bought it then is well gone now in the swings in the market.
[02:08:24.925 --> 02:08:26.845]  I mean, these are really exceptional deals.
[02:08:26.905 --> 02:08:35.329]  If people are going to get into gold and silver, they need to take advantage of this because, I mean, are your supplies of those silver half dollars and francs, are they going to last past Sunday?
[02:08:35.549 --> 02:08:37.210]  Well, the silver dollars are real tight.
[02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:42.554]  The francs, I mean, I might not even be able to sell a franc after this Sunday coming up.
[02:08:42.954 --> 02:08:46.116]  I will hold it at this point, at this dollar amount.
[02:08:46.516 --> 02:08:53.081]  But with gold going up over $11 today, I mean, we're talking about francs that were priced way back at $1,150.
[02:08:54.702 --> 02:08:56.703]  So, no, I don't think so.
[02:08:56.863 --> 02:08:57.584]  Oh, yeah.
[02:08:57.704 --> 02:08:59.045]  It was $7 a few minutes ago.
[02:08:59.105 --> 02:08:59.645]  I'm sorry.
[02:08:59.705 --> 02:09:01.366]  It's up by $10.50 right now.
[02:09:02.107 --> 02:09:03.308]  And of course, that's in the U.S.
[02:09:03.348 --> 02:09:03.648]  market.
[02:09:03.708 --> 02:09:05.329]  It's even all-time records in Europe.
[02:09:05.703 --> 02:09:24.237]  Right and the market is very strong and and you know if you're sitting there with investments in other places you're thinking man you know what should I do here I just need to tell you I mean the United States government right now I mean people usually go to the Treasury the Treasury bills for safety and security but the government
[02:09:24.597 --> 02:09:28.819]  Is printing so much money that the Treasury bills can't even hold value.
[02:09:29.119 --> 02:09:37.644]  And the sad part about it is, is that we can't afford to pay our bills as the government is concerned at the interest rates are practically at zero.
[02:09:38.024 --> 02:09:44.507]  What do you think is going to happen when we have inflation and interest rates go from, you know, a half a point to say three percent?
[02:09:44.927 --> 02:09:48.532]  I mean, we're going to have to increase our budget by almost double for that.
[02:09:48.832 --> 02:09:50.574]  You know, the United States is broke.
[02:09:50.835 --> 02:09:52.217]  The rest of the world is broke.
[02:09:52.457 --> 02:09:55.000]  There's no way that we're going to get out of this thing unscathed.
[02:09:55.361 --> 02:09:57.744]  And you need to be getting into gold and silver, period.
[02:09:57.804 --> 02:10:02.269]  And as we said, as the general public starts to figure out gold and silver are the place to be,
[02:10:03.531 --> 02:10:04.872]  All the common sense.
[02:10:04.912 --> 02:10:06.413]  I mean, I believe it's going to go way up.
[02:10:06.793 --> 02:10:09.135]  But I don't even buy it as an investment looking for that.
[02:10:09.175 --> 02:10:11.177]  I'm buying it as something I know.
[02:10:11.557 --> 02:10:12.478]  What do pirates have?
[02:10:12.518 --> 02:10:13.519]  What do governments have?
[02:10:13.859 --> 02:10:15.481]  You know, what do criminals have?
[02:10:15.501 --> 02:10:17.563]  I mean, what does anybody who's down on the street
[02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:19.564]  Who's smart, street smart.
[02:10:19.785 --> 02:10:20.686]  You want the loot.
[02:10:21.086 --> 02:10:22.547]  You want the loot, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:22.567 --> 02:10:23.869]  You want the booty.
[02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:27.452]  You don't want a bunch of paper with old dead white guys on it.
[02:10:27.733 --> 02:10:29.735]  You want to have the gold and silver.
[02:10:29.775 --> 02:10:30.415]  Here's the number 800-686-2237.
[02:10:30.435 --> 02:10:30.475]  800-686-2237.
[02:10:37.302 --> 02:10:40.284]  And the brokers are going to be there till late tonight to take your calls.
[02:10:40.484 --> 02:10:43.066]  If you call and they're not there, leave your name and number.
[02:10:43.106 --> 02:10:44.307]  They'll call you back in the morning.
[02:10:44.928 --> 02:10:47.149]  And this is only running till midnight Sunday evening, 800-686-2237.
[02:10:47.349 --> 02:11:00.799]  They've got a lot of other great deals, but the half dollar silver, the fifth of an ounce gold francs, those are the deals that you get the Alex Jones special on that I can guarantee, from my research, is as good as it gets or even better.
[02:11:00.819 --> 02:11:00.859]  800-686-2237.
[02:11:05.602 --> 02:11:10.305]  And again, I just hope that people call, and the brokers will be there throughout the weekend.
[02:11:10.325 --> 02:11:10.585]  800-686-2237.
[02:11:10.745 --> 02:11:13.687]  Ted Anderson, thank you.
[02:11:13.787 --> 02:11:15.648]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:11:15.848 --> 02:11:16.148]  You bet.
[02:11:16.548 --> 02:11:21.811]  Okay, we've had continual Bilderberg Group coverage, because this is one of the most powerful organizations in the world.
[02:11:22.151 --> 02:11:28.695]  Jim Tucker joined us, who has actual Bilderberg Group contacts inside the organization in the management level.
[02:11:28.735 --> 02:11:29.635]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:31.336]  Well, I'm going to shut up.
[02:11:31.376 --> 02:11:32.817]  The point is that
[02:11:35.043 --> 02:11:39.806]  You can set your watch and warrant by what he says, because he's been right.
[02:11:40.046 --> 02:11:44.149]  One year before the Berlin Wall, he predicted it, that they were going to stage it.
[02:11:44.189 --> 02:11:48.592]  He said March of 03, not 02, for the attack on Iraq.
[02:11:50.093 --> 02:11:53.215]  The oil prices go into $150 a barrel a year before it happened.
[02:11:53.875 --> 02:11:54.556]  On and on.
[02:11:54.836 --> 02:11:59.081]  He says green light to attack Iran, that it's all going towards that.
[02:11:59.822 --> 02:12:01.384]  A miracle could stop it, I guess.
[02:12:01.624 --> 02:12:06.549]  I mean, that'll all be written up this weekend at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, but that was huge.
[02:12:06.569 --> 02:12:13.216]  But in the last 15 minutes, I want to go to Paul Dornanew, again with Infocon.ro from Romania.
[02:12:13.877 --> 02:12:23.222]  And we have the Bilderberg Group photos, we'll put some of those on screen that he just sent us, of Wolftonson and the former head of the World Bank and others, Bill Gates, that are there.
[02:12:23.922 --> 02:12:28.585]  But Mr. Dornanew, thank you for being there in Spain to cover this, sir.
[02:12:29.225 --> 02:12:30.266]  Break down what you've witnessed.
[02:12:31.997 --> 02:12:35.160]  Hi Alex, thank you for having me on your show.
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:42.248]  Right now I'm right here in front of the police barricade in Sitges, where it goes to the Dolce Hotel.
[02:12:42.668 --> 02:12:46.533]  And I might add that this is actually my fourth deliver coverage.
[02:12:46.553 --> 02:12:51.197]  So far last year we've been detained in Greece, but this time in Sitges.
[02:12:52.839 --> 02:12:56.982]  Basically, we haven't had such problems like last year.
[02:12:57.222 --> 02:12:58.744]  Even the security is higher.
[02:12:58.804 --> 02:13:02.266]  The police here was nicer with us.
[02:13:02.286 --> 02:13:05.489]  They didn't take us away.
[02:13:05.509 --> 02:13:15.016]  We basically just sit here in this roundabout and managed to get some good pictures and managed to identify some people.
[02:13:16.274 --> 02:13:19.959]  Well that's exciting, and of course you've had a chance to talk to some of the other reporters.
[02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:30.555]  Any other intel that Tucker didn't cover here, I mean you may not have been listening, but what's some of the news the reporters are telling you that are there on the ground?
[02:13:31.035 --> 02:13:32.518]  I've heard there's quite a bit of media coverage.
[02:13:33.519 --> 02:13:54.510]  Yes, the coverage is, I would say, extraordinary compared to the previous years in Greece and Istanbul, because I could see even yesterday and today like up to five or six TV stations broadcasting live from right here, from in front of the entrance of the hotel where the police barricade is.
[02:13:54.970 --> 02:13:59.173]  So basically, I'm very, very surprised to see that happening.
[02:13:59.213 --> 02:14:08.259]  And not only that, I can see lots of people coming from other countries like Portugal, France, UK, Belgium, Czech Republic, United States.
[02:14:08.519 --> 02:14:18.866]  Lots and lots of people, independent media or just regular people coming here and offering their support, coming with their cameras, video cameras, and trying to help in one way or another.
[02:14:19.306 --> 02:14:24.550]  And I even met yesterday and today and had an interview with Esteline, Daniel Esteline.
[02:14:25.170 --> 02:14:36.120]  And actually another reporter, documentary maker, who has some very, very good information, and he was back in Italy in 2004.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.644]  If you remember, they were able to make there some very good photos.
[02:14:41.044 --> 02:14:45.528]  He also got some very good video pictures with them sitting at tables.
[02:14:46.028 --> 02:14:46.649]  We're good to go.
[02:15:10.348 --> 02:15:11.409]  I never seen before.
[02:15:11.809 --> 02:15:18.635]  About attendee list, about private conversation between doing emails, private notes.
[02:15:18.735 --> 02:15:22.979]  Is this this year or are you saying in years past?
[02:15:22.999 --> 02:15:25.380]  This was from 2004.
[02:15:25.881 --> 02:15:29.344]  Okay, so this documentary filmmaker, where are they from?
[02:15:30.542 --> 02:15:31.763]  He's from Belgium.
[02:15:31.863 --> 02:15:34.183]  His name is Giorgio Bambouse.
[02:15:34.364 --> 02:15:35.304]  Something like that.
[02:15:35.324 --> 02:15:40.706]  Well, we'd like to get him on, so if he can give us his contact information.
[02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:42.807]  He has very, very good information.
[02:15:44.207 --> 02:15:44.627]  Sure.
[02:15:44.887 --> 02:15:48.089]  What intel did Estelin give you in the interview you just conducted with him?
[02:15:48.329 --> 02:15:48.969]  What's his word?
[02:15:50.151 --> 02:15:57.267]  Well, basically yesterday he confirmed to me that the same topics that were going on and he was waiting to get more information.
[02:16:00.882 --> 02:16:05.065]  I have no special updates from him.
[02:16:05.805 --> 02:16:11.609]  I tried to cover basically everything from what's going on right now here, what they're going to do.
[02:16:11.629 --> 02:16:12.770]  Let me ask you this.
[02:16:13.811 --> 02:16:23.678]  It's certainly exciting too that he addressed a section of the European Parliament at the request of an Italian member of the EU Parliament.
[02:16:23.718 --> 02:16:25.599]  So this is definitely a route.
[02:16:26.219 --> 02:16:28.161]  Did you see the London Guardian report that
[02:16:28.841 --> 02:16:52.737]  The reporter was in there as they were shutting it down and heard the, because you could tell by the badges, the head of the Bilderberg Club, not Etienne Davignon, but his subordinates, talking about how upset and scared they are and talking about myself bullhorning them in the past and saying that a lot of the delegates didn't show up because of fear.
[02:16:54.147 --> 02:16:59.511]  Yes, I've heard about that, and I think there are people that maybe are missing.
[02:17:00.051 --> 02:17:07.036]  We've seen yesterday many cars, but we're expecting much more cars to arrive.
[02:17:07.096 --> 02:17:11.459]  So I think, yes, it's very possible that some attendees are not participating.
[02:17:11.679 --> 02:17:22.826]  And that's one fact I wanted to bring up, the intel we got from Italy, from this guy Giorgio, is that the attendees that we're getting are not true.
[02:17:24.227 --> 02:17:26.628]  Well, yeah, that's like Bill Gates.
[02:17:26.748 --> 02:17:28.828]  I mean, Bill Gates had a fake conference.
[02:17:28.848 --> 02:17:31.169]  This is mainstream news in Germany and Spain.
[02:17:31.629 --> 02:17:32.790]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[02:17:32.810 --> 02:17:33.970]  And then he got caught by the media.
[02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:39.052]  He said, well, I'm really here for Bilderberg to talk about basically population reduction.
[02:17:40.012 --> 02:17:46.254]  So just incredible developments today and such good news that these guys are really panicking.
[02:17:47.074 --> 02:17:50.557]  Confirming what Zbigniew Brzezinski was saying last week.
[02:17:50.577 --> 02:17:53.759]  I mean folks, I'm not a drinking man myself.
[02:17:53.919 --> 02:17:58.922]  I haven't been drinking lately, but this is the day to pop some champagne, I will tell you.
[02:17:58.942 --> 02:18:00.003]  We'll be right back.
[02:18:01.444 --> 02:18:02.505]  Don't answer it!
[02:18:03.306 --> 02:18:11.391]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[02:18:11.411 --> 02:18:11.951]  800-477-9256.
[02:18:12.891 --> 02:18:19.015]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[02:18:19.235 --> 02:18:23.297]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[02:18:23.517 --> 02:18:28.460]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan.
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:29.160]  I think so.
[02:18:54.252 --> 02:19:03.914]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:19:04.694 --> 02:19:05.614]  Tyranny is here.
[02:19:05.955 --> 02:19:09.675]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:19:09.715 --> 02:19:12.096]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:19:12.116 --> 02:19:17.417]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:19:19.172 --> 02:19:24.235]  This documentary proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:19:24.635 --> 02:19:30.198]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:19:30.598 --> 02:19:34.320]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:19:34.801 --> 02:19:38.823]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:19:39.083 --> 02:19:44.646]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:19:45.026 --> 02:19:47.928]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:19:48.568 --> 02:19:49.990]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:19:50.551 --> 02:19:51.031]  It's here.

[02:21:15.430 --> 02:21:19.993]  His website is infocon.ro.
[02:21:20.053 --> 02:21:25.336]  Amazing photos he gave us that are up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now.
[02:21:25.356 --> 02:21:27.778]  But you can also go to his site and see even more.
[02:21:27.818 --> 02:21:28.939]  They're reporting on Bilderberg.
[02:21:29.799 --> 02:21:31.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the global elite.
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:42.908]  And the fact that they're scared, and some didn't show up, and that Bill Gates had a fake medical conference in Barcelona that he then didn't attend, that wasn't real, and now he admits he is at Bilderberg.
[02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:45.670]  This is just incredible.
[02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.571]  These are the people engineering the global collapse.
[02:21:48.411 --> 02:21:51.173]  Paul Dornanew, in the time we've got left, finish up the point you were trying to make.
[02:21:52.369 --> 02:21:52.869]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:52.909 --> 02:22:01.696]  I was trying to say that you said about Bill Gates, well, I photographed earlier yesterday, Craig Mundy from Microsoft.
[02:22:02.136 --> 02:22:03.797]  So, they're here.
[02:22:05.098 --> 02:22:14.245]  What I wanted to say is that from the other information I managed to get from here is that there might be other
[02:22:14.785 --> 02:22:17.687]  Smaller Bilderberg conferences throughout the year.
[02:22:18.127 --> 02:22:23.750]  For example, last November in Brussels there was another Bilderberg meeting.
[02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:27.952]  Only the steering committee had met.
[02:22:28.572 --> 02:22:31.173]  So we should try to investigate that more.
[02:22:32.634 --> 02:22:36.116]  Obviously there are more secret meetings of those people.
[02:22:36.923 --> 02:22:37.403]  Exactly.
[02:22:37.443 --> 02:22:40.786]  I mean, back in the 50s, they could meet once a year and steer things.
[02:22:40.846 --> 02:22:42.147]  Now, they're meeting every month.
[02:22:42.747 --> 02:22:44.808]  And they meet at Trilateral Commission meetings.
[02:22:44.888 --> 02:22:49.592]  Others, like the Australian News reported, heads of 28 biggest banks meet in secret.
[02:22:50.332 --> 02:22:53.054]  You know, so there's lots of other secret meetings going on.
[02:22:53.534 --> 02:22:57.997]  But Bilderberg, being one of the most central meetings, has really brought this out in the open.
[02:22:58.497 --> 02:23:05.922]  And they, I mean, Tucker said in his 30-plus years of covering it, they are the most unhappy and dejected that he's seen them.
[02:23:05.942 --> 02:23:06.683]  So that's good news.
[02:23:08.823 --> 02:23:09.103]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:09.164 --> 02:23:15.185]  Well, I'm very happy to see that more and more people are waking up and they are coming here.
[02:23:15.305 --> 02:23:27.687]  I was not expecting I'd also see that much media coverage and so many people coming from around the Europe and United States to try to be here and coverage from different media around the world.
[02:23:28.568 --> 02:23:32.809]  So that's a very good thing and that's what we should try to do next year as well.
[02:23:33.229 --> 02:23:34.289]  Yeah, more and more people
[02:23:38.007 --> 02:23:38.828]  Well, absolutely.
[02:23:38.848 --> 02:23:41.250]  Well, I just want to say we salute the work you're doing.
[02:23:42.031 --> 02:23:48.936]  And I mean, is it heartening for you to see more and more people every year, more and more press coverage, more and more exposure?
[02:23:49.317 --> 02:23:51.138]  Now world government is out in the open.
[02:23:51.178 --> 02:23:54.341]  We can have a serious debate about whether we want to be slaves or not.
[02:23:55.424 --> 02:24:05.353]  Well, what I think is that right now we can really hope that we can fight them and stop the new order and try to change the things in the world.
[02:24:06.213 --> 02:24:16.863]  In closing, and we'll get you back on next week once you've gotten back to Romania to give us an overall view of what you witnessed there and more photos and video you've gotten, we'll show it here on TV as we simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv, but
[02:24:22.279 --> 02:24:26.729]  I mean, in closing, in Romania, what type of awakening are you seeing?
[02:24:27.833 --> 02:24:33.256]  Well, there's an awakening in Romania, too, because, you know, a few years ago, that's when I started doing this.
[02:24:33.636 --> 02:24:42.782]  Nobody was talking about it, and when you were talking about it, they were saying you're crazy, this is, you know, conspiracy theories, and such and such.
[02:24:43.162 --> 02:24:54.849]  So I wanted to basically demonstrate and show them, look, they exist, they're there, and they're meeting in secret and taking decisions which you don't know about.
[02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.449]  Okay?
[02:24:55.469 --> 02:24:56.250]  And they affect you.
[02:24:56.917 --> 02:25:04.962]  So basically, more and more people, more and more media in Romania as well, they are basically awakening and trying to talk about it.
[02:25:05.083 --> 02:25:07.864]  Even politicians know about it.
[02:25:08.245 --> 02:25:12.387]  For example, this is a transcript of Daniel Eftelian's presentation in Brussels.
[02:25:12.788 --> 02:25:18.872]  I got it from a friend who is a European Parliamentarian in Brussels, in the Parliament of Europe.
[02:25:19.892 --> 02:25:20.872]  Well, that's incredible.
[02:25:20.913 --> 02:25:30.017]  Yeah, it's just more and more we are identifying the real rulers instead of the pawns, the Barack Obamas and the David Camerons.
[02:25:30.437 --> 02:25:31.658]  Great job.
[02:25:31.718 --> 02:25:32.178]  Stay there.
[02:25:32.578 --> 02:25:34.539]  Paul Dornan, I want to talk to you once the show's over.
[02:25:34.819 --> 02:25:38.481]  Retransmission starts now with six different guests today.
[02:25:38.541 --> 02:25:39.982]  Back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:25:40.022 --> 02:25:40.342]  Central.
[02:25:42.103 --> 02:25:43.784]  You are listening to GCN.
