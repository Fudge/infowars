[00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:09.385]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.045 --> 00:00:10.865]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:12.526]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:16.869]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:28.910]  This is the Alex Jones Show on Tuesday, the 7th of September, 2010.
[00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:41.325]  My name's Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex, who's away at the moment working on a project with Jesse Ventura, the former governor, in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:00:42.409 --> 00:01:01.961]  I'll be filling in for Alex today and I'm, as most of you know, the writer and editor for Alex's website PrisonPlanet.com and stay tuned today because in the second hour we've got Bob Chapman, veteran stockbroker, economist and at one time of course one of the biggest gold and silver traders
[00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:17.926]  In the world, and Bob will be joining us to talk about the deepening double dip recession, the worsening unemployment picture, and of course what we can all do to prepare financially for what's coming down the pipeline.
[00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:20.527]  And Bob joins us in the second hour.
[00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:28.430]  But first, I want to talk to you about a subject which we've constantly covered on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.712]  It was at the forefront of Alex's documentary in 2006, Endgame.
[00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:39.214]  And of course, that subject is eugenics.
[00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:47.978]  The notion that our scientific elites should be empowered with the divine right to rule over life and death.
[00:01:49.130 --> 00:02:06.681]  And of course, this discussion shot back into the news last week where we had the story out of Maryland with this crazed gunman, James J. Lee, who was inspired by Al Gore's global warming documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.
[00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:17.903]  Um, who went into the Discovery Channel building in downtown Silver Spring, explosives strapped to his chest, guns, and he took these hostages.
[00:02:17.943 --> 00:02:19.304]  The police ended up killing him.
[00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:33.547]  Now, of course, many of you then read Lee's online screed, which was posted on PrisonPlanet.com, which explained the motivation behind why he did what he did.
[00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:34.747]  And of course,
[00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:39.626]  His motivation was global warming, overpopulation.
[00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:51.911]  He had bought into the brainwashing, the myth that is eugenics, that's being promoted on a top-down basis to everyone in the world right now.
[00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.812]  And that's what led to his attempted massacre.
[00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:56.413]  Thankfully he didn't kill anybody.
[00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:15.062]  Now Alex Jones has documented the origins of eugenics in his film Endgame from Malthus to Hitler to the Galton Institute from Britain through America and into the 70s when sterilization was finally outlawed in America.
[00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:30.596]  But I want to talk to you today about the origins and the motivations behind Neo-eugenics, which is the thinly veiled doctrine of overpopulation and man-made global warming.
[00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:35.522]  That's what Neo-eugenics is disguised behind in today's world.
[00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:50.738]  And more specifically, I want to talk to you about how we've been bathed, inoculated and induced into this, what I describe in my article today on PrisonPlanet.com, as a religion of death.
[00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.203]  This widespread belief, and it is shockingly widespread,
[00:03:56.328 --> 00:04:06.032]  That humans should be sterilized or indeed killed in large numbers in the name of saving the planet from environmental destruction.
[00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:15.957]  And it's a belief that's now becoming so widespread that people like James J. Lee are starting to act on it with violence.
[00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:34.087]  And of course we read the horrible story out of Argentina a few months ago where the parents were involved in a suicide pact and actually killed their own son as well as shooting their own baby before killing themselves in homage to global warming.
[00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:41.772]  So we're going to explore this religion of death and how it threatens us all after the break on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:42.593]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:04.217]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:05.138]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:08.601]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:09.441]  Number 2.
[00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:14.285]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:15.066]  It's true.
[00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:19.929]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.790]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.353]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.653 --> 00:05:28.356]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:29.097]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.357 --> 00:05:31.719]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:35.502]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:36.003]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:40.506]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.747 --> 00:05:45.491]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:02.193]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:06.096]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:07:06.376 --> 00:07:09.018]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:14.261]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:20.306]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:25.929]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.971]  Try their new evacuation pack.
[00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:30.512]  A two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:07:30.772 --> 00:07:38.894]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:07:39.254 --> 00:07:41.095]  Get yourself and your family ready today.

[00:07:52.998 --> 00:07:59.045]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:08.195]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:11.779]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.444 --> 00:08:18.706]  It's the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, September 7th.
[00:08:18.906 --> 00:08:21.808]  Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.608 --> 00:08:27.351]  And we're talking about neo-eugenics and man-made global warming.
[00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:38.117]  The inspiration behind James J. Lee's attempted rampage last week when he entered the Discovery Channel building with explosives and guns.
[00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:47.082]  Now, we were just starting to get into how the neo-eugenics agenda manifests itself in the modern day era.
[00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:59.950]  And it's amazing to me to think that even in the aftermath of Climategate, you know, of Hide the Decline, of Amazongate, of the admitted fact that the IPCC
[00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:21.972]  Now admits that they just make up the numbers to fit the doctrine, Pachauri now admits that on the record, that people still trust these same environmentalists that are coming out with the overpopulation rhetoric, even when they've been caught lying at every juncture about global warming, about man-made climate change.
[00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:29.593]  And now those same people are saying that the world is drastically overpopulated and we need to do something about it.
[00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:30.655]  Fast.
[00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:33.820]  And we need to do something drastic about it.
[00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:46.058]  And indeed, it's amazing just how many people are still brainwashed, even though now the majority know that global warming, that man-made global warming is a fraud.
[00:09:46.538 --> 00:09:54.085]  Still, vast amounts of people believe in this myth of overpopulation, and I want to destroy that today.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.801]  Because it's one of the biggest myths out there.
[00:09:58.101 --> 00:10:16.945]  It's propagated by liars who have no interest in the environment, but who have one sole interest in citing overpopulation as a means through which they can control your lives with draconian population reduction measures.
[00:10:18.177 --> 00:10:20.638]  Now, overpopulation's a myth.
[00:10:20.978 --> 00:10:29.542]  I don't care, you know, what your tutor told you, what your professor told you, what you read out of, you know, Al Gore's books.
[00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:31.863]  It's documented.
[00:10:32.023 --> 00:10:35.705]  The global fertility rate has been falling since the 50s.
[00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:36.645]  That's a fact.
[00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:38.566]  That's the UN's own numbers.
[00:10:39.557 --> 00:10:46.081]  Not least because of all these gender-bending, you know, endoctrine disruptors in our food and water.
[00:10:46.582 --> 00:10:47.542]  The vaccines.
[00:10:48.403 --> 00:10:54.527]  We got the documents just last week from the Rockefeller Institute about putting sterolants in vaccines.
[00:10:54.807 --> 00:10:55.988]  This was in the 60s.
[00:10:56.208 --> 00:10:57.609]  This was in their own documents.
[00:10:58.649 --> 00:11:05.294]  The soft kill weapons that the elite have launched against us, which are all now becoming public, by phenol A.
[00:11:08.004 --> 00:11:17.437]  And in fact, the Rockefellers worked with the World Health Organization to introduce that global vaccine program, which was focused around sterilizing people.
[00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:24.902]  So now we see fertility across the world falling at dramatic rates.
[00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:43.416]  In Brazil, in Indonesia, even in parts of India and other areas of the third world, fertility is falling so fast that it's already reached around 2.1, which is just at the replacement rate to replace humanity, two for two.
[00:11:44.256 --> 00:11:45.917]  And in many European countries,
[00:11:46.838 --> 00:11:47.659]  It's below that.
[00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:51.843]  So in fact, the population of Europe is literally dying out.
[00:11:52.083 --> 00:11:57.608]  This is why Russia and other governments have to beg their populations to have children.
[00:11:58.109 --> 00:11:59.390]  Because they're dying out.
[00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:06.557]  And it's going to be an economic wasteland if the amount of people in Europe continue to decline.
[00:12:08.223 --> 00:12:17.709]  So across the whole world, the UN's own figures state that population, that the fertility rate will sink to 2.1 by 2050.
[00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.412]  So as soon as we get to 2050, population starts to decline.
[00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:27.015]  Overpopulation is not a problem.
[00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:31.377]  The only problem that will exist is underpopulation after 2050.
[00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:35.400]  And that's going to be a major issue for future generations.
[00:12:37.068 --> 00:13:04.771]  And even though these figures proving that population, that overpopulation is a myth, come from the UN, those very same people who work for the UN, under the IPCC, will then kick and scream about how we need this planetary regime, in the words of John P. Holdren, White House Science Czar, to enact these draconian population control measures in order to save the Earth.
[00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:21.806]  Alex has exhaustively documented Ecoscience, Holdren's 1977 textbook, which talks about these horrific measures of forced sterilization, forced abortion, one-child policy.
[00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:24.847]  And this guy is now in the White House!
[00:13:24.907 --> 00:13:26.568]  He's Obama's science czar!
[00:13:27.308 --> 00:13:31.890]  And he's at these global conferences talking about geoengineering the planet.
[00:13:33.171 --> 00:13:35.713]  And it's no wonder that we see all these chemtrails now.
[00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:39.336]  We see the pollution of our water supply.
[00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:47.843]  We see real environmental issues being ignored and in fact pushed by the elite as part of this population reduction agenda.
[00:13:48.624 --> 00:14:00.614]  Meanwhile a fearmonger about overpopulation when their own figures prove that by 2050 world population will start to decline and it will continue to decline.
[00:14:51.862 --> 00:14:53.895]  Welcome to a Time-Stand Still!
[00:14:54.585 --> 00:14:56.286]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:56.346 --> 00:14:57.527]  It's Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:14:57.567 --> 00:14:58.168]  Sorry for that.
[00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:00.089]  We're on Skype.
[00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:05.974]  Gremlin's in the system and it's not always perfect because I'm sat here at home and not in a radio studio.
[00:15:06.895 --> 00:15:18.464]  But we were talking about the myth of overpopulation and the fact that the UN's own figures prove that it is a myth and that world population will start to decline dramatically after 2050.
[00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:22.187]  So it's established that overpopulation is a fraud.
[00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:33.362]  And yet still, people in the environmental movement push this as a reason to enact these draconian control measures on our lives.
[00:15:33.402 --> 00:15:36.025]  Things like the carbon tax, the one-child policy.
[00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:57.278]  And what's fundamentally scary about who actually is advocating these measures is that it's not just John Holdren and people in the White House, which is obviously scary enough, and Al Gore and James Lovelock and Hanson and all the rest of them.
[00:15:58.178 --> 00:16:07.581]  But if you trace this back to the 80s where it began, this eugenics idea that we need to reduce global population dramatically,
[00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:30.784]  It actually traces back, in one sense, to one of the most evil men that has ever been considered to walk the earth, and that is Charlie Manson, the mastermind of the nine infamous brutal murders in 1969 in California, including those of Sharon Tate and her unborn baby.
[00:16:32.677 --> 00:16:41.581]  Now, here's something you probably didn't know, and it's something I didn't know until I started watching the prison interview tapes with Charlie Manson.
[00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:48.504]  Charlie Manson, in the mid-1980s, was one of the first global warming alarmists.
[00:16:50.585 --> 00:17:00.869]  So Manson, this cult leader, shares the same belief system as Al Gore, John P. Holdren, James Lovelock, Hanson, and the rest of the climate cult.
[00:17:01.994 --> 00:17:16.160]  And Manson states very clearly in these prison interviews that CO2 is destroying the Earth, that emitting it is a sin, and that we need to carry out mass eugenics soft kill programs in order to reduce overpopulation.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.882]  And this is not just, you know, what he was talking about 20 years ago.
[00:17:20.942 --> 00:17:30.626]  To this day, Manson, in his prison cell, has a new breed of followers that come to hear his environmentalist message about overpopulation.
[00:17:31.721 --> 00:17:46.785]  Now we're going to go to a clip, which is a 1988 prison interview with Manson, conducted by Geraldo Rivera, where Manson talks about how we need to kill 50 million people in order to save the planet.
[00:17:46.925 --> 00:17:48.346]  So now we go to this clip.
[00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:52.961]  I chopped up nine hogs, and I'm going to chop up some more.
[00:17:53.001 --> 00:17:55.482]  I'm going to kill you as many as I can.
[00:17:55.522 --> 00:17:57.123]  I'm going to pile you up to the sky.
[00:17:57.464 --> 00:17:58.604]  I figured about 50 million.
[00:17:58.764 --> 00:18:04.187]  If I could get about 50 million of you, I might be able to save my trees, and my air, and my water, and my wildlife.
[00:18:04.488 --> 00:18:05.668]  Do I kill 50 million people?
[00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:09.110]  Well, that's just a drop in the bucket of what's really coming.
[00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:13.633]  That's just a drop in the bucket of what's really coming.
[00:18:15.342 --> 00:18:25.708]  So there you have Manson talking about the need to kill 50 million people and pile the bodies up to save the air, the trees, the water, the animals.
[00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:40.417]  We have other clips posted in this article on PrisonPlanet.com where he talks about the polar ice caps melting, the heat from people's cars contributing to global warming.
[00:18:41.298 --> 00:18:44.660]  Charlie Manson, the infamous murder mastermind,
[00:18:46.735 --> 00:18:53.497]  was one of the foremost and first promoters of global warming alarmism.
[00:18:53.937 --> 00:18:55.177]  Now, why does that matter?
[00:18:55.437 --> 00:19:01.699]  Some people will say, you know, what does it matter what this guy who's been in prison for, you know, 40 years says?
[00:19:02.219 --> 00:19:09.541]  Well, it matters because his rhetoric matches exactly the rhetoric of the White House science czar.
[00:19:10.802 --> 00:19:15.023]  John P. Holdren and Charlie Manson are saying the same thing.
[00:19:16.829 --> 00:19:24.431]  And in fact, in John P. Holdren's Ecoscience, he makes it very clear who should be running this eugenics program.
[00:19:24.971 --> 00:19:27.252]  He talks about a planetary regime.
[00:19:27.912 --> 00:19:34.394]  Which is very interesting, considering who Charlie Manson said should be running this system.
[00:19:34.714 --> 00:19:35.934]  And we go to that clip now.
[00:19:35.954 --> 00:19:40.675]  Man doesn't back up to his fear.
[00:19:40.695 --> 00:19:41.956]  He goes straight into his fear.
[00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:42.996]  We've got to get a one world government.
[00:19:49.382 --> 00:19:51.263]  A one world government!
[00:19:52.104 --> 00:19:59.808]  That's what we're talking about with this eugenics soft kill program and we'll explore it more after this break on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:59.828 --> 00:20:00.368]  Stay tuned!

[00:21:01.853 --> 00:21:06.154]  If you listen to the radio, watch TV, or surf the net, you're hearing about gold.
[00:21:06.434 --> 00:21:08.995]  Eventually you will ask yourself, is gold right for me?
[00:21:09.255 --> 00:21:10.375]  The answer might surprise you.

[00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:15.516]  Is your home insured?
[00:21:15.536 --> 00:21:16.896]  Do you carry life insurance?
[00:21:17.116 --> 00:21:18.357]  How about financial insurance?
[00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.297]  If you own gold, then the answer is yes.
[00:21:20.657 --> 00:21:24.078]  If you don't own gold, the question is why don't you have financial insurance?
[00:21:24.338 --> 00:21:26.020]  We put our faith in things we trust.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.341]  Do you trust the dollar?
[00:21:27.361 --> 00:21:28.623]  Do you trust the economy?
[00:21:28.803 --> 00:21:29.764]  Do you trust the government?

[00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.351]  Where will you put your faith?
[00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:39.154]  Now is the time to protect yourself and your family.

[00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:05.800]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.680]  What have we got?
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.042]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:09.342 --> 00:22:10.083]  A republic.
[00:22:10.363 --> 00:22:12.945]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:13.005 --> 00:22:14.926]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:17.188]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:17.288 --> 00:22:18.569]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:18.969 --> 00:22:20.090]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:20.691]  Children?
[00:22:20.911 --> 00:22:21.691]  Our education?
[00:22:22.032 --> 00:22:22.652]  Our money?
[00:22:22.852 --> 00:22:26.515]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:26.855 --> 00:22:30.519]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:31.541]  You are being warned.
[00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:32.662]  We have the facts.
[00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:33.983]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:34.023 --> 00:22:34.905]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:34.925 --> 00:22:35.766]  We have common law.
[00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:38.068]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:22:42.213 --> 00:22:46.997]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[00:24:15.697 --> 00:24:19.579]  Welcome back, it's the Alex Jones Show, Tuesday, September 7th.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:26.203]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex, who is away working on a project with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:24:27.344 --> 00:24:29.645]  And we're talking about the religion of death.
[00:24:30.326 --> 00:24:37.710]  We're being brainwashed, not only politically, financially, socially, but spiritually and culturally.
[00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:42.133]  We're being brainwashed to believe in the religion of death.
[00:24:42.913 --> 00:24:49.019]  Neo-eugenics under the cloak of global warming and the myth of overpopulation.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:25:03.134]  And we were playing the clips before the break of notorious criminal mastermind, the man who led the cult, the infamous Manson family that slaughtered nine people in the summer of 1969.
[00:25:05.336 --> 00:25:15.581]  And Manson, from his prison cell in California, now has a new mission for his followers, and that is the mission of environmentalism and overpopulation.
[00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:33.569]  Which, as far back as the mid-80s, Manson communicated through these prison interviews when he said that the polar ice caps were melting because of CO2, and that we need to kill 50 million people in order to save the air, the water, the trees, and the animals.
[00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:46.030]  And just by coincidence, the modern proponents of neo-eugenics, people like Al Gore, John P. Holdren, James Lovelock, are saying exactly the same thing as Charlie Manson.
[00:25:46.310 --> 00:26:01.883]  Does that concern us at all, that a man who masterminded the brutal slaughterings of nine people, and who has a swastika carved in his forehead, has the same doctrines as the people who now run the environmental movement?
[00:26:02.463 --> 00:26:03.964]  Should that concern us at all?
[00:26:05.025 --> 00:26:05.966]  Let me know what you think.
[00:26:06.006 --> 00:26:11.690]  We'll take your calls in the next segment on 800-259-9231.
[00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.293]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:26:17.134 --> 00:26:18.855]  So we played the clips of Manson.
[00:26:19.336 --> 00:26:25.820]  Charlie Manson saying we need to kill 50 million people and that's just a drop in the bucket of what's really coming.
[00:26:26.681 --> 00:26:31.649]  And he went further in other interviews, especially more recent interviews in fact.
[00:26:32.671 --> 00:26:37.539]  For example, an interview with CNN or a phone conversation that was obtained by CNN.
[00:26:39.468 --> 00:26:45.213]  Manson said that basically carbon dioxide is a sin and we need to pay indulgences on it.
[00:26:45.393 --> 00:26:53.340]  He said we were sinning against the air and all these documents and videos are linked from my article today on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:54.281 --> 00:27:00.106]  So we see Charlie Manson embracing the same beliefs as Al Gore with the carbon tax.
[00:27:00.386 --> 00:27:07.032]  We see him embracing the same beliefs as John P Holdren with the mass kill eugenics policy.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.383]  And we also see him calling for a return to the agrarian age in another interview.
[00:27:14.824 --> 00:27:16.645]  They interview one of his followers.
[00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:17.285]  That's right.
[00:27:17.305 --> 00:27:23.909]  I mean, Manson's got a new family now that move close to the prison and listen to his lectures on global warming.
[00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:29.152]  And, uh, quote, Charlie says we need to get back to the horse.
[00:27:29.232 --> 00:27:31.353]  That's what one of Manson's followers said.
[00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:48.797]  So now he's preaching, um, that we need to return to the agrarian age, the pre-1700 pre-industrial age, um, which is also something advocated by an author called Keith Farnish, who is a top environmentalist, and he wrote a book
[00:27:49.833 --> 00:28:00.676]  Recently calling for acts of sabotage and environmental terrorism in blowing up dams and demolishing cities in order to return the planet to a pre-industrial society.
[00:28:01.136 --> 00:28:12.720]  Now what's amazing about his book is it's endorsed by Dr. James Hansen, who is one of the most prominent environmentalists and scientists in America.
[00:28:14.168 --> 00:28:17.251]  You know, he's the NASA guy, he's the big NASA guy, James Hansen.
[00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:25.278]  He endorses a book that calls for demolishing industrial society in the name of saving the planet.
[00:28:26.419 --> 00:28:36.208]  And this is similar rhetoric to what the murder mastermind Charles Manson now preaches to his new following from his jail cell in California.
[00:28:38.956 --> 00:28:58.564]  And of course, we're talking about this because last week, James J. Lee, this crazed gunman, went into the Discovery Channel building with explosives, took hostages, and we later learned that he did so because he wanted the Discovery Channel to air more programming about global warming.
[00:28:59.364 --> 00:29:22.782]  So, these not cases that are being influenced by this eugenicist propaganda, these people that have been inducted, who have bought the religion of death, are now out there acting on their crazed beliefs of overpopulation and man-made global warming by committing or attempting to commit acts of violence.
[00:29:22.882 --> 00:29:26.605]  We had the couple in Argentina who killed their own child.
[00:29:28.325 --> 00:29:31.366]  So I want to hear what you think about this when we come back after the break.
[00:29:32.726 --> 00:29:35.026]  We'll take your calls on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:35.306 --> 00:29:41.767]  What do you think about the religion of death and the fact that it's advocated by not only Holdren but also Charlie Manson?
[00:29:43.128 --> 00:29:43.748]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:43.828 --> 00:29:44.368]  We'll be back.
[00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:46.088]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:51.569]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:53.669]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.609 --> 00:29:57.270]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.126 --> 00:30:04.128]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[00:31:04.013 --> 00:31:04.934]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.274 --> 00:31:09.198]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.218 --> 00:31:11.440]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.905]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.326 --> 00:31:23.572]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:23.972 --> 00:31:29.535]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:29.936 --> 00:31:33.638]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.138 --> 00:31:38.141]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.421 --> 00:31:43.924]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.364 --> 00:31:47.306]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:47.926 --> 00:31:49.347]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:50.328]  It's here.

[00:32:52.206 --> 00:32:52.646]  Thank you.
[00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:09.163]  They came and took it all away.
[00:33:17.802 --> 00:33:21.584]  It's the Alex Jones Show, top story on prisonplanet.com today.
[00:33:21.864 --> 00:33:28.948]  Charles Manson, the infamous leader of the Manson family cult, is now bedfellow of Al Gore.
[00:33:29.148 --> 00:33:34.190]  He's preaching the doctrine of man-made global warming and the myth of overpopulation.
[00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:46.497]  So what do you think about this religion of death, this neo-eugenics agenda, and how we're being induced into it by culture, by television, by advertising, by movies?
[00:33:47.137 --> 00:33:50.999]  We're going to go to your calls, and the first caller is David in Texas.
[00:33:51.079 --> 00:33:52.200]  David, you're on the air.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.240]  What's on your mind today?
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.481]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:58.163]  Well, I want to stay on your subject matter.
[00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:03.946]  I'm dry calling because I get to rebroadcast at night, so I'm not listening to you live, but it doesn't surprise me.
[00:34:03.966 --> 00:34:09.789]  I mean, this is the direction it's been going for a long time, and what scares me is the things we don't know.
[00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:14.351]  So the fact that Manson's got on board on this, it doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:34:14.371 --> 00:34:15.872]  And the fact that they're giving him press,
[00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:18.367]  You know, the guy's locked up in jail.
[00:34:19.188 --> 00:34:21.690]  What do we even know what he's thinking, anyway?
[00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:22.811]  The guy's in jail.
[00:34:23.431 --> 00:34:27.614]  You know, so it's a little odd that what he thinks matters to anybody, first of all.
[00:34:28.575 --> 00:34:30.356]  You know, the guy's in jail for a reason.
[00:34:31.157 --> 00:34:38.062]  But, no, it doesn't surprise me at all, and it's going to get worse, I'm afraid, unless people wake up.
[00:34:38.102 --> 00:34:44.527]  I mean, a lot of people are listening to your program and waking up, but I'm not sure we're all waking up fast enough.
[00:34:46.656 --> 00:34:53.182]  Well, what I find interesting about it is, you mentioned the fact, why are people listening to this guy?
[00:34:53.862 --> 00:35:06.514]  It's interesting that when the corporate media does get a chance to interview Manson, and the last television interviews were in the 80s because they actually banned them from interviewing him on camera, but CNN
[00:35:08.015 --> 00:35:16.704]  Got these quotes from him and got this interview with his followers I believe at the turn of the year because it was Manson's 75th birthday.
[00:35:17.385 --> 00:35:28.616]  So they're still getting access to his rhetoric and his propaganda and now he's kind of building up this new breed of followers to communicate this neo-eugenics message.
[00:35:28.936 --> 00:35:29.977]  But what's amazing is
[00:35:30.618 --> 00:35:43.109]  Whenever Manson rambles on at length, and to be fair, I mean, Manson's an intelligent guy, he's a sadist, and he's, you know, he brutally masterminded these murders, but he's an intelligent guy.
[00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:56.482]  But the media attack everything vaguely intelligent that he says, but when he talks about wanting to kill 50 million people because the environment's in trouble, that's the only point on which the media
[00:35:57.262 --> 00:35:59.748]  Um, say, well, yeah, he's kind of got a point there.
[00:36:00.108 --> 00:36:05.600]  You know, it's reasonable to want to kill people, to want to sterilize people, to solve overpopulation.
[00:36:06.161 --> 00:36:07.945]  So, I mean...
[00:36:09.429 --> 00:36:25.472]  Manson is now this kind of counterculture hero because he's been so derided and attacked by the establishment, but the establishment actually agrees with him that killing people for Mother Earth is reasonable, is rational, and now you've got a guy in the White House who believes the same thing.
[00:36:26.273 --> 00:36:29.593]  So that's what, you know, is truly frightening to me about this story.
[00:36:30.373 --> 00:36:31.454]  Thanks for the call, David.
[00:36:31.474 --> 00:36:34.514]  We're going to move on to Wilson in Florida.
[00:36:34.554 --> 00:36:35.635]  Wilson, you're on the air.
[00:36:38.007 --> 00:36:39.608]  Hey, uh, good afternoon.
[00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:41.609]  It's just unfortunate.
[00:36:41.629 --> 00:36:43.391]  I didn't even know he was still alive.
[00:36:43.631 --> 00:36:48.454]  And I just heard you say, like, I thought he was dead or he got killed, like, since his death.
[00:36:48.514 --> 00:36:51.856]  But it's unbelievable that he's still alive.
[00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:59.441]  And then on top of that, they're, like, almost using his words to help, like, influence people and stuff, you know?
[00:36:59.481 --> 00:37:07.106]  And I just think it's unfortunate that people are easily influenced, because even some of my closest friends and family don't understand the true agenda.
[00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:15.053]  I've came across, like, teachings that they believe themselves that the world is too overpopulated.
[00:37:15.073 --> 00:37:17.154]  And, you know, it's just unbelievable.
[00:37:17.194 --> 00:37:18.554]  And I just have one question for you.
[00:37:19.434 --> 00:37:25.957]  At what point do you think the world will become actually a threat, you know, populated?
[00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:32.660]  Because I don't think no time soon will the world, like, you know, there's a whole bunch of places people could live.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.181]  I don't think it'll be any time soon for maybe hundreds of years.
[00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:41.553]  At what point do you think the population might be too severe?
[00:37:43.054 --> 00:37:59.605]  Well, that's what I was talking about earlier, is the fact that if you look at the charts which the UN has produced in terms of world population, and in actual fact if you go on prisonplanet.com and search for the overpopulation myth, you can see these charts.
[00:38:00.245 --> 00:38:07.571]  And what the charts show is that the birth replacement rate rises and then falls down to 2.1.
[00:38:08.211 --> 00:38:11.794]  And this is worldwide, this is not just in third world countries.
[00:38:12.214 --> 00:38:19.020]  So by 2050, the world's population reaches a stage where it cannot replace itself.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:26.408]  So you will only get a rise in population until 2050 and then after that it starts dropping off dramatically.
[00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:36.660]  And what's ironic about all this is the fact that these environmentalists are publicly on the record about how they want to destroy industrialized society.
[00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:47.729]  When in fact the only thing that has proven to naturally balance population levels in poor countries is industrialism itself, is those countries getting richer.
[00:38:48.269 --> 00:38:58.197]  So by calling for this de-industrialization process, this post-industrial revolution as Bilderberg calls for, they are in fact ensuring that
[00:38:58.737 --> 00:39:00.598]  Global population will increase.
[00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:05.560]  If the third world remains poor and destitute, then population will begin to increase.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:14.664]  But if we allow these poor countries to develop, then their populations will naturally balance out, and after 2050, the population will begin to fall.
[00:39:16.545 --> 00:39:31.417]  So that's where the numbers are heading according to the UN's own figures and we've got graphs and links to The Economist which reported on that which you can check out by typing in theoverpopulationmyth on prisonplanet.com.
[00:39:32.278 --> 00:39:35.541]  So we're going to move on to our next caller which is Tom in New York.
[00:39:35.601 --> 00:39:36.442]  Tom, you're on the air.
[00:39:36.462 --> 00:39:38.944]  Hello Paul.
[00:39:39.904 --> 00:39:41.446]  Yeah, what's on your mind today Tom?
[00:39:42.745 --> 00:39:50.828]  Well, that correlation is potentially very huge as far as Manson and Gore.
[00:39:52.148 --> 00:40:05.293]  If that could be promoted with a nice documentary icing that cake, man, that would set him back because that is huge.
[00:40:06.534 --> 00:40:09.755]  But how long has he been espousing these views?
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:36.769]  Manson has been espousing these views since, as far as I know, at least 1987, which was when one of the first interviews was conducted with him by, I believe it was NBC, and they refused to show the original interview because the content was so shocking, but in 2007 they broadcast the entire interview, which you can watch from the article on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:37.789 --> 00:40:46.371]  So, Manson was espousing this global warming rhetoric as early as 1987, which is of course before Al Gore came on the scene.
[00:40:47.271 --> 00:41:04.114]  But if you listen to his comments now, his more recent comments about emitting CO2 being a sin against life, a sin against the earth, that's exactly what Gore advocates with this carbon tax and this whole indulgence thing related to global warming.
[00:41:05.894 --> 00:41:16.660]  And what amazes me furthermore about it, we had a previous caller talking about how Manson still has followers and in fact now has a growing army of followers.
[00:41:17.301 --> 00:41:27.747]  And what's amazing to me is if you go and watch these videos on YouTube of these prison interviews with Manson where he talks about needing to kill 50 million people,
[00:41:28.487 --> 00:41:41.319]  Then you go and read the comments underneath the interviews and the majority of people not only idolize Manson, but they agree specifically that we need to kill millions of people in order to save the Earth.
[00:41:42.039 --> 00:41:50.827]  So, I mean, this message is getting out there and it's taking hold, more so than global warming itself, which is increasingly being discredited.
[00:41:51.688 --> 00:41:54.731]  But another example of how people are jumping on this bandwagon
[00:41:56.434 --> 00:42:07.520]  Uh, we played the clip earlier of Manson saying, um, we, we've got to get a one world government, that's what he said, in response to how we need to solve these environmental problems.
[00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:15.365]  And if you go to all these disgusting fan websites which have been set up for Manson by his followers today,
[00:42:16.527 --> 00:42:23.330]  For example, there's one called, uh, uses the acronym for ATWA, which is Air, Trees, Water and Animals.
[00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.751]  It's Manson's environmental creed.
[00:42:26.532 --> 00:42:37.117]  And on its front page, there's an image of the world surrounded in flames with the words new, with the words, sorry, One World Order written underneath.
[00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:47.221]  And then there's further links on this Manson Fan website where he talks about how we need to live a green lifestyle in pursuit of this one world order.
[00:42:48.162 --> 00:42:56.472]  So it's, it's the rhetoric matches precisely that of top environmentalists who have called for the need to a world government
[00:42:57.358 --> 00:43:05.323]  A planetary regime, as John Holdren termed it, to carry out this eco-fascist tyranny that they want to get in place.
[00:43:06.003 --> 00:43:15.548]  And the fact that Manson's rhetoric and that of his followers, of his fans, matches that, mirrors that, echoes that, is fundamentally disturbing to me.
[00:43:15.949 --> 00:43:19.471]  I don't care that Manson's a 75-year-old guy locked in a prison cell.
[00:43:20.211 --> 00:43:27.277]  Read the CNN article, he's got new followers that are on the outside preaching this message of neo-eugenics.
[00:43:27.778 --> 00:43:29.579]  Preaching this religion of death.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.561]  And it's something that's, um...
[00:43:33.251 --> 00:43:36.372]  Increasingly, you know, taking a stranglehold over culture.
[00:43:36.412 --> 00:43:37.232]  I mean, just look at this.
[00:43:37.592 --> 00:43:39.133]  Just tune into MTV.
[00:43:39.613 --> 00:43:41.133]  Look at the trash that's on there.
[00:43:41.513 --> 00:43:42.934]  Look at the music videos.
[00:43:43.034 --> 00:43:44.154]  Lady Gaga.
[00:43:44.894 --> 00:43:46.395]  We've wrote articles about this.
[00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:48.035]  This is the Babylon system.
[00:43:48.095 --> 00:43:49.616]  This is the religion of death.
[00:43:50.276 --> 00:43:53.738]  And I'm not on some kind of religious, righteous rant.
[00:43:54.318 --> 00:44:06.565]  I'm just talking about the basic fact that our moral compasses have been totally corrupted and retuned towards accepting these immoral, nihilistic traits.
[00:44:07.646 --> 00:44:11.989]  And I mean, overpopulation and man-made global warming ties in perfectly to that.
[00:44:12.329 --> 00:44:20.133]  Because it's about how humans are evil, how we need to be controlled, how we need to be sterilized, how we need to be killed to save Mother Earth.
[00:44:20.874 --> 00:44:26.117]  And it's a justification for tyrants to carry out whatever tyranny they wish.
[00:44:26.937 --> 00:44:31.682]  And now we're being bombarded with it, not only politically, but also spiritually and culturally.
[00:44:32.342 --> 00:44:34.745]  Through MTV, through advertising, through the movies.
[00:44:35.585 --> 00:44:43.133]  Alex was talking about the Fox News Network clip just a couple of days ago, where Fox News admitted
[00:44:44.417 --> 00:44:48.880]  That they work in global warming propaganda into all their sitcoms.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:59.126]  So an open admission that they work in political propaganda, not into their news programming, but into their actual sitcoms, you know, that all the zombies watch from day to day.
[00:44:59.466 --> 00:45:03.909]  Because they know they're not reaching as many people with the news anymore, because people don't watch it.
[00:45:04.749 --> 00:45:16.151]  So this thing has got its tentacles deep within society and that's why we've put it at the forefront of our agenda to expose the programs of the New World Order and how they manifest themselves in 2010.
[00:45:16.211 --> 00:45:21.992]  So we're going to move on to our next caller now and it's Aaron in Nebraska.
[00:45:22.012 --> 00:45:23.652]  Aaron, what's on your mind today?
[00:45:24.853 --> 00:45:25.893]  Heyo, what's going on, Paul?
[00:45:27.173 --> 00:45:32.974]  That clip of Manson talking about one world government, I never knew about that and that just blows my mind.
[00:45:33.655 --> 00:45:44.522]  I think it all comes back on a personal level about, you know, 50 million Americans not having health care and being the most, the sickest people of all recorded time.
[00:45:45.403 --> 00:45:56.650]  And I got a friend, he needs surgery to save his life, but, you know, Medicaid turned him down, you know, and I mean, we're poverty struck over here and we have, you know, no options.
[00:45:57.171 --> 00:46:00.753]  And if your audience can Google the Aaron Hansen Fund,
[00:46:01.555 --> 00:46:03.756]  A-A-R-O-N-H-A-N-S-E-N.
[00:46:04.236 --> 00:46:06.136]  The Aaron Hanson Surgery Fund.
[00:46:06.756 --> 00:46:07.777]  I would really appreciate it.
[00:46:07.797 --> 00:46:09.437]  It would bring up the website.
[00:46:09.917 --> 00:46:12.598]  Just get back to a base level to help each other out.
[00:46:13.038 --> 00:46:14.538]  To beat this on a base level.
[00:46:15.198 --> 00:46:17.879]  It's all global, but it all comes back to a personal level.
[00:46:20.279 --> 00:46:21.300]  OK, thanks for the call.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.180]  We're going to go to Chad in Arkansas.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.200]  Chad, you're on the air.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:24.641]  Go ahead.
[00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:30.974]  I just wanted to say thank you very much for your topic today.
[00:46:30.994 --> 00:46:48.549]  I just wanted to share my reaction in that it amazes me the nature of information and that, you know, I know about Charles Manson, but I certainly wasn't totally aware of his link to the Al Gore global warming myth.
[00:46:49.189 --> 00:46:53.873]  But I really feel like this discussion is the opposite of secrecy.
[00:46:55.491 --> 00:47:21.498]  You know, just in talking about these subjects in relation to the Discovery Center hostage situation, I think it just triggers a way that everybody can, you know, after being scared to death by all this being brought into the mainstream, I think it gives us a real opportunity to acknowledge that this is not a loose
[00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:32.972]  I just had a question.
[00:47:34.333 --> 00:47:50.636]  Do you think it would be valuable if there was some kind of a meeting with people like Alex Jones and people of differing opinions, kind of a national discussion?
[00:47:53.906 --> 00:47:55.347]  Um, it's certainly an idea.
[00:47:55.407 --> 00:48:07.391]  I mean, the point that Alex makes on a regular basis is that, you know, he has a national discussion with people from his studio to millions of people through the radio show and then YouTube on a daily basis.
[00:48:08.091 --> 00:48:22.037]  So, if you're talking about getting media attention, though, through, uh, not, you know, not using the same topics as Glenn Beck, but we saw the Glenn Beck function last week, um, then yeah, that, that would attract media attention.
[00:48:22.117 --> 00:48:22.257]  So,
[00:48:23.377 --> 00:48:38.769]  Uh, any kind of function like that does spread the truth, but of course it's always vulnerable to infiltrators, to provocateurs, whereas if Alex is just broadcasting the truth from his own studio, then, you know, it's not vulnerable to that.
[00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:43.711]  So, I mean, there have certainly been conferences and gatherings in the past.
[00:48:44.632 --> 00:48:47.413]  The Los Angeles event for 9-11 Truth.
[00:48:48.453 --> 00:48:53.116]  There are numerous events for 9-11 Truth coming up over the next few days in New York.
[00:48:53.696 --> 00:49:06.722]  So, yeah, we definitely need to combine the power of the Internet with, you know, the physical process of meeting each other and getting mainstream media attention via that avenue.
[00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:10.074]  But it's interesting what you were talking about before.
[00:49:12.904 --> 00:49:15.966]  Global warming itself has been completely eviscerated.
[00:49:16.026 --> 00:49:28.915]  I mean, since ClimateGate, the Chicago Climate Exchange, you know, for the trading of CO2 credits, owned by Al Gore and Maurice Strong and all these alarmists, has lost two-thirds of its value.
[00:49:29.336 --> 00:49:36.441]  The majority of Americans, the majority of people worldwide distrust and disbelieve in man-made global warming.
[00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:38.482]  The carbon tax is in trouble.
[00:49:39.063 --> 00:49:40.243]  So it's an example of how
[00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:47.368]  We've eviscerated trust in their myth and now they're having big problems implementing it.
[00:49:47.909 --> 00:49:52.292]  And I think that by pointing out the fact that Charlie Manson, this infamous
[00:49:53.430 --> 00:50:11.795]  Murder Mastermind now preaches the same beliefs as Al Gore and James J. Lee, the guy who went into the building with the explosives and the guns, really underlines how much of a extremist and dangerous, dangerous lie this whole man-made climate change myth has become.
[00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:16.976]  Because people are now violently acting out in support of it.
[00:50:18.672 --> 00:50:22.635]  So we're going to go to our next caller, which is Baron in Canada, just before the break.
[00:50:22.696 --> 00:50:23.516]  Baron, go ahead.
[00:50:25.978 --> 00:50:37.528]  Okay, um, I wanted to talk about solar flares and how Charlie Manson might have, um, come to the point where, how 2012, there is going to be a solar flare.
[00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:44.634]  And there's a lot of talk on, like, NASA or Data 3 Channel saying that it could wipe out all the satellites.
[00:50:45.015 --> 00:50:46.336]  And if there were no satellites,
[00:50:47.131 --> 00:50:51.493]  Imagine pretty much all the generators and everything crashing.
[00:50:52.154 --> 00:50:55.816]  All the cities need more, like six more months before they can get energy back.
[00:50:56.896 --> 00:50:57.617]  Okay, stay there.
[00:50:57.637 --> 00:50:58.978]  We'll talk about it after the break.
[00:50:58.998 --> 00:50:59.518]  Stay tuned.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.161]  If your handgun is loaded and easy to get to, it's also dangerous.
[00:51:05.621 --> 00:51:10.383]  What if you could reach your loaded handgun instantly and still provide a margin of safety for your family?

[00:52:00.047 --> 00:52:02.348]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.428 --> 00:52:04.629]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.749 --> 00:52:07.550]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.951 --> 00:52:12.713]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.053 --> 00:52:17.255]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.555 --> 00:52:19.896]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.916 --> 00:52:22.437]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.457 --> 00:52:25.358]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.699 --> 00:52:33.322]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.655 --> 00:52:38.899]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.919 --> 00:52:41.321]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.881 --> 00:52:45.324]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.584 --> 00:52:46.505]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.645 --> 00:52:47.926]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.986 --> 00:52:48.987]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.352 --> 00:53:02.374]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:53:02.714 --> 00:53:06.337]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:53:06.637 --> 00:53:10.099]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:18.285]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from

[00:54:18.063 --> 00:54:23.871]  Alive at PrisonPlanet.tv, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:24.212 --> 00:54:31.202]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex who is away in the Gulf working on a project with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:54:31.302 --> 00:54:32.945]  Alex will be back in a few days.
[00:54:33.846 --> 00:54:41.113]  We got Bob Chapman coming up in the next hour to talk about the economy, to talk about unemployment and the double-dip recession.
[00:54:41.634 --> 00:54:57.950]  But at the moment we're discussing the neo-eugenics agenda and the religion of death that we've been bathed in and indoctrinated to accept as this kind of received wisdom that overpopulation is a threat when in fact it's a complete myth.
[00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:06.257]  And that we need to sterilize, or in fact kill, millions of people in order to save the planet from the threat of global warming.
[00:55:06.757 --> 00:55:21.850]  And of course we were talking about the fact that Charlie Manson now holds the same beliefs as Al Gore, who now holds the same beliefs as James J. Lee, the guy who ran into the Discovery Channel building and took hostages last week in the name of global warming.
[00:55:22.331 --> 00:55:23.111]  And we're going to
[00:55:23.872 --> 00:55:25.333]  Talk to you now on the line.
[00:55:25.513 --> 00:55:27.055]  It's Bob in Ohio.
[00:55:27.135 --> 00:55:28.015]  Bob, you're on the air.
[00:55:28.035 --> 00:55:28.476]  Go ahead.
[00:55:30.317 --> 00:55:36.282]  Hey, what an honor, and I just praise the good Lord for people like yourself.
[00:55:36.682 --> 00:55:39.024]  You've done such an amazing, wonderful job.
[00:55:39.744 --> 00:55:43.728]  Kudos to all of it and thousands of others and names we won't go into.
[00:55:45.129 --> 00:55:47.090]  Non-vet, two tours, mid-60s, okay?
[00:55:48.703 --> 00:55:51.925]  When I came home, I protested the war, the Vietnam War.
[00:55:52.005 --> 00:55:57.607]  I protested going into Iraq and how they conducted this war.
[00:55:57.667 --> 00:56:10.113]  Back to Chucky Manson, we knew even back then that it was a case of demon possession on Chucky Manson, okay, that he was a psychopath from the pits of hell.
[00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:12.915]  So nobody did an exorcism on him.
[00:56:14.718 --> 00:56:21.423]  I want to give you kudos on that, and we knew that even then, and he hasn't changed even to this day.
[00:56:23.804 --> 00:56:32.570]  There are things going on in this world because of a spirit of delusion and confusion and faithlessness towards God.
[00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:34.351]  I'm a fundamentalist, okay?
[00:56:35.332 --> 00:56:37.293]  And a conservative voter.
[00:56:38.634 --> 00:56:41.996]  It has crept in and taken over our government, okay?
[00:56:43.441 --> 00:57:06.673]  And with all the lies from people like Al Gore and Holdren and others, I just want to get back to fundamentals, both in our politics and our patriotism towards America as a country, as an individual country, and people got to get back to fundamentals and good, straight thinking.
[00:57:11.489 --> 00:57:19.031]  I thank God for all of you guys, and praise the good Lord Jesus, and I'll let you get on to other callers.
[00:57:19.332 --> 00:57:21.652]  And Paul, hey, I love you guys.
[00:57:21.872 --> 00:57:28.915]  Hey, you've done great work for America, for people around the world, and for God and the truth.
[00:57:29.275 --> 00:57:32.916]  Hey, thank you for letting me get my two cents in, and God bless you all.
[00:57:34.483 --> 00:57:36.483]  Okay, thanks Bob, thanks for the kind words.
[00:57:37.744 --> 00:57:48.326]  I mean, yeah, the entire drive of this religion of death that we've been talking about is to stop people from getting back to straight thinking, as you just said.
[00:57:48.886 --> 00:57:53.807]  I mean, we're being bombarded from every angle with either sex or death.
[00:57:54.127 --> 00:57:57.848]  I mean, that's what it's all about now with the modern culture and the modern media.
[00:57:59.941 --> 00:58:11.215]  Every single television commercial you watch, every single major movie you watch now, has these messages about sex and death subliminally embedded in it.
[00:58:11.235 --> 00:58:13.858]  And that's not some kind of far-fetched claim.
[00:58:13.878 --> 00:58:18.764]  We've actually got the documents from the advertising agencies that admit to doing this.
[00:58:19.571 --> 00:58:24.033]  So we're being bombarded on such a massive level to accept this religion of death.
[00:58:24.573 --> 00:58:27.354]  And we'll be back after the break to talk about it more.
[00:58:27.674 --> 00:58:29.855]  Also with Bob Chapman on the economy coming up.
[00:58:30.276 --> 00:58:30.836]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:30.856 --> 00:58:33.757]  This is the Alex Jones Show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.221]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.281 --> 00:58:46.082]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.950 --> 00:59:05.391]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:10.121]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:11.102 --> 00:59:23.086]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:59:23.866 --> 00:59:31.168]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:59:31.828 --> 00:59:41.411]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:59:42.191 --> 00:59:45.472]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:59:46.112 --> 00:59:49.213]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:59:53.228 --> 00:59:55.149]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:58.492]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.137 --> 01:00:05.777]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.438 --> 01:00:07.498]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.199 --> 01:00:09.340]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.781]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.462]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.103 --> 01:00:16.745]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.286 --> 01:00:21.349]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.335 --> 01:00:28.279]  It's the second hour of the Alex Jones Show on Tuesday, September 7th, 2010.
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:41.734]  My name's Paul Joseph Watson, editor and writer for PrisonPlanet.com, and I'll be filling in for Alex today and tomorrow, because he's in the Gulf working on a project with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:42.867 --> 01:00:58.353]  Now we're speaking with our special guest today, which is Bob Chapman, and of course, as most listeners will know, Bob is normally with us every Friday to talk about the economy, so it's a little change of schedule in that we've invited Bob to join us today.
[01:01:00.174 --> 01:01:11.698]  Most of you will know who Bob Chapman is, the editor, writer, publisher of the International Forecaster, one of the most accurate and well-respected financial newsletters out there.
[01:01:11.718 --> 01:01:23.662]  And of course, before that, Bob was a stockbroker for nearly three decades, having at one time been one of the largest gold and silver brokers on the planet.
[01:01:24.622 --> 01:01:30.307]  And now the International Forecaster reaches over 10,000 investors and brokers on a monthly basis.
[01:01:31.067 --> 01:01:39.134]  And of course we feature Bob's articles on a weekly basis from theinternationalforecaster.com at prisonplanet.com.
[01:01:39.674 --> 01:01:42.076]  Bob Chapman, welcome to the show today.
[01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:51.364]  Well, thank you and thank you for the very nice introduction and I am an admirer of your work as well.
[01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:56.892]  And I hope we can keep on doing what we're doing until we stop these people.
[01:01:56.912 --> 01:02:01.254]  Well, I couldn't agree more, Bob, and thanks for the kind words.
[01:02:03.535 --> 01:02:15.141]  I saw a headline today starting off with the unemployment situation out of Bloomberg, and it says, unemployment in US may rise towards 10% on feeble growth.
[01:02:16.101 --> 01:02:39.894]  And I wanted to talk about this because last week I was amazed after reading that the US economy had lost 54,000 jobs in August alone and yet afterwards I visited Bloomberg and CNBC and you know the rest of the happy clappers reporting the news and they said that losing 54,000 jobs was a positive thing!
[01:02:40.794 --> 01:02:49.099]  Now, I mean, that's kind of like slipping over and breaking both your legs and then describing it as positive because, you know, at least you didn't break your neck.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:57.084]  But Bob, I mean, how can the mainstream media describe losing 54,000 jobs as a positive thing?
[01:02:57.164 --> 01:02:58.164]  What's going on here?
[01:02:59.965 --> 01:03:02.587]  Well, as you know, it's called psychological warfare.
[01:03:03.668 --> 01:03:07.510]  And they will pick the path that
[01:03:08.303 --> 01:03:11.224]  is most enlightened for their ideas.
[01:03:11.584 --> 01:03:16.746]  What they didn't mention was that the birth-death ratio increased.
[01:03:16.966 --> 01:03:32.633]  I don't have the figure in front of me, but I think it was 124,000 jobs, which were made up out of thin air, as usual, up from about 89,000 the previous month, that were also made up out of thin air.
[01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:34.813]  So you have to add that 124
[01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:42.643]  To the 67, and you come up with over 100,000 jobs.
[01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:47.626]  200,000 jobs that were created out of thin air.
[01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:55.731]  And that's the kind of gobbledygook they go through every month, in order to confuse and mislead people, instead of using U6.
[01:03:56.731 --> 01:03:59.253]  And U6 is 16 and 7 eighths percent.
[01:03:59.713 --> 01:04:06.177]  And if you withdraw that birth-death ratio, the real unemployment is 21 and 3 eighths percent.
[01:04:08.379 --> 01:04:25.628]  Right, that's what I was going to go on to say, because back during the time of the Great Depression, wasn't it the case that the unemployment figure was more accurately calculated, which is why unemployment got to 16% in 1931.
[01:04:26.008 --> 01:04:34.333]  So now you're saying that with the accurate figure taken into account, the unemployment rate is actually already over 21%.
[01:04:34.373 --> 01:04:34.713]  Is that true?
[01:04:37.312 --> 01:04:45.182]  That's true and in 1933-34 the figure was 25% and so that puts in a league between 1932 and 1934 and I might add after spending lots of money the increase in the
[01:04:55.942 --> 01:04:57.544]  We'll be back.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.061]  It's true.
[01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:20.786]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.066 --> 01:05:24.369]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.649 --> 01:05:28.392]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.373 --> 01:05:31.755]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.136 --> 01:05:35.479]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:40.501]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.741 --> 01:05:45.503]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.783 --> 01:05:49.804]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.964 --> 01:05:51.525]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:05:59.628 --> 01:06:02.388]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:06:02.769 --> 01:06:06.289]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:09.210]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:14.451]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:14.811 --> 01:06:16.331]  They're the best company out there.
[01:06:16.591 --> 01:06:20.472]  The longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.

[01:06:23.092 --> 01:06:26.113]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:06:26.433 --> 01:06:28.153]  Try their new evacuation pack.
[01:06:28.353 --> 01:06:28.753]  We're good to go!

[01:07:57.195 --> 01:07:58.075]  Others don't.
[01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:03.242]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.802 --> 01:08:06.662]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.903 --> 01:08:13.184]  It's the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex.
[01:08:13.484 --> 01:08:18.705]  And we're talking with Bob Chapman, noted economist and former stockbroker.
[01:08:19.346 --> 01:08:23.286]  And Bob was talking about the real unemployment figure.
[01:08:24.387 --> 01:08:27.528]  The official unemployment figure from the Labour Department is 9.6%.
[01:08:29.488 --> 01:08:43.122]  Bob was pointing out that once you factor in the figures that they hide, it's actually up around 21% unemployment in America, which outstrips the 16% of 1931 and is fast approaching the 25% of 1933.
[01:08:43.222 --> 01:08:45.064]  We're talking great depression levels.
[01:08:53.712 --> 01:09:10.501]  Now Bob, just finishing off on this, as far as I understand it, when the Labour Department announces those official job numbers, is it the case that they don't even count the people who have stopped looking for work, which is a giant proportion of people?
[01:09:11.342 --> 01:09:17.665]  And that's why many people see these job figures as a joke and in fact the more
[01:09:18.726 --> 01:09:19.567]  Well, ballpark-wise, they're right.
[01:09:38.098 --> 01:09:53.167]  That figure of discouraged workers is included in U6 along with those who are forced to take part-time employment and those who are no longer receiving a check from the state for unemployment.
[01:09:53.988 --> 01:10:01.993]  And so it is officially 16 and 7 8ths percent, but those figures are Mickey Mouse too.
[01:10:02.955 --> 01:10:11.362]  But then you add in the absence of birth-death ratio, and you've got that 21.38% figure.
[01:10:11.402 --> 01:10:23.111]  But going back, with all the money that was poured in by FDR, unemployment did go down, but in 1939, it was 17.4%, and in 1940, it was 16.2%.
[01:10:32.376 --> 01:10:40.300]  With all the money that was spent, some headway was made on a temporary basis over, we'll say, a five-year period.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.841]  But they still hadn't gotten out of the Depression.
[01:10:43.561 --> 01:10:47.423]  And the only reason that they did is they arranged for another war.
[01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.225]  And that's why we had the Second World War.
[01:10:51.445 --> 01:10:54.627]  And we're facing the same thing today.
[01:10:55.387 --> 01:10:59.069]  They are not addressing the underlying problems.
[01:10:59.529 --> 01:11:01.450]  They're just throwing money at it, so to speak.
[01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:19.375]  Right and now we've got Paul Krugman saying that we're basically in a 1938 situation where to recover this massive unemployment crisis we're going to need something on the scale of another war.
[01:11:20.055 --> 01:11:31.459]  So they're now coming out and saying that we need a massive crisis to shift the attention away from this unemployment crisis and that's going to take the form of a war.
[01:11:32.299 --> 01:11:39.202]  So it's amazing how, you know, we're repeating the very same historical path that we took in the 1930s.
[01:11:42.024 --> 01:11:44.065]  And we've done that over and over again.
[01:11:44.085 --> 01:11:46.066]  This is nothing new.
[01:11:46.146 --> 01:11:47.906]  If you go back into history, it's all there.
[01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:51.048]  And I've been saying that for some time.
[01:11:51.088 --> 01:11:59.372]  In fact, I predicted 9-11 and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan based upon that.
[01:12:00.152 --> 01:12:01.393]  And it was very, very close.
[01:12:02.683 --> 01:12:23.745]  Knowing that I had to back into the information, because I certainly don't have any connections in the Council on Foreign Relations or the Trilateral Commission of the Bilderberg Group, and Paul Krugman evidently is backing into it as well, because I don't know that he's privy to that information either.
[01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:27.111]  No, I mean, that's exactly right.
[01:12:27.131 --> 01:12:37.374]  I mean, he's just, he's basically just repeating what people like Salente and you have been saying for years, and that's what a lot of the mainstream economists are now doing.
[01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:46.297]  I see on, you know, CNBC and Bloomberg, they're just repeating what us so-called doomsayers have been saying for years.
[01:12:46.397 --> 01:12:48.958]  So, I mean, you know, nothing new under the sun.
[01:12:50.618 --> 01:13:11.378]  The US dollar, now you posted an article on the internationalforecaster.com called the reckless mess created by the Fed, and in that article you talk about the effect of QE2, this fresh round of money printing that the Federal Reserve is about to embark on.
[01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:32.375]  And what's interesting to me is the fact that, you know, not long after the Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, we saw a dramatic rise in the value of the US dollar because, you know, people were fleeing out of these so-called risky assets and into the perceived safe haven of the greenback.
[01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:37.058]  And this has pretty much, you know, stayed true up until the last few months when
[01:13:37.959 --> 01:13:48.967]  I've noticed, and other economic writers have also noted the trend, is that now, when good news about the US economy comes out, the dollar goes down.
[01:13:49.928 --> 01:13:58.274]  And when bad news about the US economy comes out, or bad news in general, worldwide, about the economy, the dollar also goes down.
[01:13:58.795 --> 01:14:01.337]  So now, the greenback seems to
[01:14:01.997 --> 01:14:05.780]  Not be thriving on this threat of a double-dip recession.
[01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:12.266]  Certainly apart from today, the euro's been climbing again against the dollar for the past two or three months.
[01:14:12.867 --> 01:14:20.774]  So, is this the start of this massive collapse in the US dollar that many people have been talking about?
[01:14:21.854 --> 01:14:25.678]  Or is this just a temporary decline in the dollar?
[01:14:25.738 --> 01:14:27.980]  I mean, where do you see it heading in the short term?
[01:14:30.017 --> 01:14:37.719]  Well, I think you have to go back to the Wall Street and banking titans, if you may.
[01:14:39.279 --> 01:14:48.042]  It was a year ago, in October, that they started to go along the dollar and short the euro, and I couldn't figure out what they were up to.
[01:14:49.082 --> 01:14:52.903]  And finally, it jogged my head in February or March,
[01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:55.151]  Aha, this is what they're going for.
[01:14:55.551 --> 01:15:05.338]  And that, of course, was the Greek incident, the problem of the other four Eurozone participants, financially and economically.
[01:15:06.278 --> 01:15:11.041]  And it was the exposure of these events, which had been known for some time.
[01:15:11.742 --> 01:15:15.704]  So it was an effort to take the dollar up and cheapen the Euro.
[01:15:17.358 --> 01:15:20.359]  It gave the Europeans in the Eurozone a respite.
[01:15:20.839 --> 01:15:26.981]  It allowed them to jack up their exports and have a better economy for several months.
[01:15:27.561 --> 01:15:34.483]  And now we're seeing the exports start to wane because the Euro got up to 131 approximately.
[01:15:34.523 --> 01:15:36.283]  It's around 127 right now.
[01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:38.884]  And it gave them some breathing room.
[01:15:39.624 --> 01:15:46.446]  At the same time, they have used Greece to
[01:15:47.549 --> 01:15:58.478]  Um, to bring forward the problems of the Eurozone to perhaps keep the dollar from plunging quickly or more quickly.
[01:15:59.018 --> 01:16:07.005]  And incidentally, I was supposed to be on Greek radio this morning and I, they had to cancel on me, but I'll be back on there again to give my two cents worth.
[01:16:07.745 --> 01:16:12.509]  But, um, the dollar is perpetually under pressure.
[01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:16.813]  Um, a year and a half ago, approximately the,
[01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:26.516]  Central banks of the world were holding in foreign exchange 64.5% of their assets were in dollars.
[01:16:26.956 --> 01:16:30.899]  They're now around 59.5% somewhere in that vicinity.
[01:16:30.939 --> 01:16:33.500]  I haven't seen a new figure for a few months.
[01:16:34.501 --> 01:16:36.522]  And that means they're selling dollars.
[01:16:37.382 --> 01:16:39.703]  And so this is a perpetual thing.
[01:16:40.564 --> 01:16:42.225]  The Chinese were selling dollars.
[01:16:43.085 --> 01:16:45.747]  They sold about $100 billion worth over the last year.
[01:16:46.474 --> 01:16:52.380]  So there is eternal pressure on the dollar, and that's how they were able to bring it up, and now it's come back on its way down.
[01:16:53.021 --> 01:17:05.875]  If you look at the chart, a long-term chart, on the dollar, which is the USDX, six major currencies versus the dollar, you will see it has completed a perfect head and shoulders.
[01:17:06.775 --> 01:17:08.077]  And so the dollar's going down.
[01:17:08.775 --> 01:17:22.630]  And incidentally, that perfect head and shoulders also exists for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tells me it as well is sometime over the next several months going to go back down as well.
[01:17:24.505 --> 01:17:45.073]  Right, and so the traditional relationship between the Dow and the Dollar over the past couple of years, which is that when the Dow goes down, the Dollar goes up, you're saying that now that relationship has decoupled and that both the Dow and the Dollar are heading straight down in the immediate future?
[01:17:46.534 --> 01:17:53.417]  Yes, and as an addendum to that, at the same time, over the past 16 months,
[01:17:54.051 --> 01:17:55.973]  We have had a decoupling.
[01:17:57.194 --> 01:18:01.798]  And the percentage varies upon who you talk to.
[01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:10.285]  But the influence of the dollar on gold has been reduced to somewhere between 20 and 40 percent.
[01:18:10.545 --> 01:18:11.666]  So we'll call it 30.
[01:18:12.266 --> 01:18:18.311]  So when they used to go together, now they're going in opposite directions.
[01:18:18.672 --> 01:18:22.715]  And the reason for that is not inflation or deflation.
[01:18:23.379 --> 01:18:30.904]  The reason is that the gold is becoming the main adversary of the dollar.
[01:18:31.785 --> 01:18:38.929]  And it is taking over from the dollar its position as the world reserve currency.
[01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:41.351]  And most people miss this.
[01:18:42.592 --> 01:18:47.155]  Now, yes, we have either inflation or hyperinflation coming.
[01:18:47.595 --> 01:18:49.657]  We'll know that over the next several months.
[01:18:50.437 --> 01:18:51.558]  And that would be caused
[01:18:52.239 --> 01:18:54.360]  Hyperinflation by QE2.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:04.964]  And most people don't realize that, and economists too, that there's a big difference between inflation and hyperinflation.
[01:19:06.444 --> 01:19:17.468]  Inflation is when an economy overheats and when the economy's consumables, such as labor and commodities, are so in demand due to economic growth
[01:19:17.944 --> 01:19:23.805]  And with an expansion is credit environment that consumables rise in price.
[01:19:24.485 --> 01:19:30.606]  This forces all goods and services to rise in price as well, so producers can keep up with costs.
[01:19:31.206 --> 01:19:33.507]  It is essentially a demand-driven phenomenon.
[01:19:34.227 --> 01:19:38.488]  Hyperinflation is a loss of faith in the currency.
[01:19:39.088 --> 01:19:44.869]  Prices rise in a hyperinflationary environment just like an inflationary environment.
[01:19:45.532 --> 01:19:53.538]  But they rise not because people want more money for their labor or for their commodities, but because people are trying to get out of the currency.
[01:19:54.319 --> 01:19:58.922]  Okay, we'll be back after the break to talk about that and your questions for Bob Chapman.
[01:19:59.302 --> 01:20:01.004]  Stay tuned, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:01.024 --> 01:20:03.726]  You've seen our Sinopresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:20:03.786 --> 01:20:05.727]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:20:05.847 --> 01:20:08.509]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:20:08.609 --> 01:20:10.511]  Are you waiting for a Sinopresh discount?
[01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:12.012]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:20:12.232 --> 01:20:14.114]  But first, the facts.
[01:20:14.134 --> 01:20:17.777]  67 other products merely treat symptoms and not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:20:18.037 --> 01:20:21.540]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:29.126]  But now, many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[01:20:51.017 --> 01:20:51.377]  It works!
[01:21:00.865 --> 01:21:01.225]  Gold.
[01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:05.766]  If you listen to the radio, watch TV, or surf the net, you are hearing about gold.
[01:21:06.026 --> 01:21:08.587]  Eventually you will ask yourself, is gold right for me?
[01:21:08.847 --> 01:21:09.967]  The answer might surprise you.
[01:21:10.267 --> 01:21:12.648]  We protect ourselves and our families from many things.
[01:21:12.668 --> 01:21:14.048]  Do you have medical insurance?
[01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:15.129]  Is your home insured?
[01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:16.489]  Do you carry life insurance?
[01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:17.969]  How about financial insurance?
[01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:19.890]  If you own gold, then the answer is yes.
[01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:23.691]  If you don't own gold, the question is why don't you have financial insurance?
[01:21:23.931 --> 01:21:25.611]  We put our faith in things we trust.
[01:21:25.971 --> 01:21:26.952]  Do you trust the dollar?
[01:21:27.152 --> 01:21:28.192]  Do you trust the economy?
[01:21:28.372 --> 01:21:29.372]  Do you trust the government?
[01:21:29.632 --> 01:21:31.532]  Gold has always been something you can trust.
[01:21:31.812 --> 01:21:34.513]  For thousands of years, people have put their faith in gold.
[01:21:34.793 --> 01:21:35.933]  Where will you put your faith?
[01:21:36.173 --> 01:21:38.734]  Now is the time to protect yourself and your family.

[01:21:50.916 --> 01:21:53.798]  And as for Jim Parker, let me help you get started today.
[01:21:53.818 --> 01:21:57.120]  1-800-686-2237, extension 242.
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:02.843]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:22:02.923 --> 01:22:05.104]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:22:05.124 --> 01:22:08.066]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:22:08.446 --> 01:22:13.209]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:13.549 --> 01:22:17.752]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:18.052 --> 01:22:20.396]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:20.516 --> 01:22:22.920]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:25.864]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:26.204 --> 01:22:33.816]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:34.133 --> 01:22:39.396]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:39.516 --> 01:22:42.318]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:42.378 --> 01:22:45.800]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.001]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:47.121 --> 01:22:48.442]  You're everyone else.

[01:22:59.784 --> 01:23:06.089]  With no end in sight for the global financial crisis, it's become very evident there is a global food shortage upon us.
[01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:09.372]  What if your local grocery store was suddenly closed?
[01:23:10.053 --> 01:23:10.473]  What if?
[01:23:11.094 --> 01:23:14.497]  The time to prepare yourself and your family for what if is now.

[01:23:54.428 --> 01:23:55.168]  Sale ends September 13th.
[01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:26.885]  This is the Alex Jones Show, September 7th, and we're talking to Bob Chapman, noted economist, veteran stock trader, about the unemployment picture, the direction of the dollar, the Dow, the whole gamut.
[01:24:27.725 --> 01:24:51.997]  Now, with regard to the Dow heading down, which is what Bob was talking about before the break, we had the news late last week about how the SEC is finally getting around to investigating whether the infamous flash crash of May the 6th, where the Dow temporarily dropped nearly a thousand points in the space of minutes, was in fact caused by manipulation.
[01:24:52.857 --> 01:25:05.569]  Uh, many of you will remember how the corporate media instantly tried to, uh, sweep the whole thing under the carpet by blaming it on a trader with a fat finger who mistakenly inputted an extra zero.
[01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:10.434]  And, uh, you know, that explanation held up for all of, what, five minutes?
[01:25:10.894 --> 01:25:13.597]  You know, go back to sleep, move along, nothing to see here.
[01:25:13.997 --> 01:25:14.578]  Didn't work.
[01:25:15.098 --> 01:25:23.522]  And now, four months later, we're still searching for a definitive explanation about what caused such a dramatic collapse.
[01:25:24.002 --> 01:25:41.150]  And in fact, the Wall Street Journal pointed yesterday to the use of what they call quote stuffing, which is where a large number of orders are placed to buy or sell a stock and then the orders are subsequently cancelled, which of course artificially distorts the market
[01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.790]  I don't
[01:25:59.725 --> 01:26:02.146]  Exactly like manipulation by insiders.
[01:26:03.207 --> 01:26:04.648]  I mean, what was the intention?
[01:26:04.688 --> 01:26:09.910]  Did these guys just do it so they could go in and buy up a ton of stocks on the cheap?
[01:26:10.811 --> 01:26:12.172]  Or was there something more to it?
[01:26:14.133 --> 01:26:23.578]  Well, I think buying stocks on the cheap is always something that they have in mind because of the way that they operate, which is the greed factor.
[01:26:24.118 --> 01:26:27.800]  They also were showing the
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:34.663]  Congress, that if you don't do what we want you to do, then you're going to have a problem.
[01:26:35.684 --> 01:26:40.447]  And that problem was we can manipulate the market anytime we want and get away with it.
[01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:46.250]  And they were doing it primarily to make sure this financial regulation bill was passed.
[01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:47.391]  And it was.
[01:26:48.531 --> 01:26:50.792]  And this sort of thing goes on all the time.
[01:26:51.733 --> 01:26:56.916]  And the rigging of markets is something the SEC simply won't deal with.
[01:26:57.754 --> 01:27:00.656]  The SEC is an absolute disgrace.
[01:27:01.536 --> 01:27:11.701]  All they have ever done is chase middle-sized and small brokers around trying to find something wrong with them and fining them and throwing them out of the business.
[01:27:12.221 --> 01:27:14.943]  And they've been harassing newsletter writers for years as well.
[01:27:15.883 --> 01:27:24.928]  And your example of Madoff and I could go back 25, 30 years in the complaints I filed and nothing was done about it.
[01:27:25.518 --> 01:27:38.054]  Because they protect, their job is to protect the titans of Wall Street and banking from any sort of exposure for the criminal activity that they're engaged in.
[01:27:40.603 --> 01:27:56.010]  So, what you're saying is this flash crash was essentially a threat by Goldman Sachs and the bankers to basically send a message, which is, you know, audit the Fed, shut down too big to fails.
[01:27:56.090 --> 01:28:01.653]  If you go ahead with that, then we've got the power to crush the markets in an instant.
[01:28:01.873 --> 01:28:04.654]  So they were sending a pretty strong message, were they?
[01:28:05.835 --> 01:28:06.395]  That's right.
[01:28:07.279 --> 01:28:15.102]  And, uh, they knew within 20 to 30 minutes of it happening exactly how it happened and who did it.
[01:28:16.522 --> 01:28:17.843]  And they're not going to go after it.
[01:28:18.383 --> 01:28:20.104]  They didn't go after Madoff either.
[01:28:20.564 --> 01:28:22.145]  And it was a reason for that as well.
[01:28:22.165 --> 01:28:27.467]  In fact, you know, that thing was going on for 10 years or so, or more.
[01:28:28.247 --> 01:28:31.688]  And it was a CIA Mossad operation is what it was.
[01:28:32.508 --> 01:28:34.029]  And there were hundreds of people involved.
[01:28:35.154 --> 01:28:37.835]  And, you know, Madoff took the fall for everybody.
[01:28:39.076 --> 01:28:39.576]  Eventually.
[01:28:40.576 --> 01:28:42.517]  But not because of the SEC.
[01:28:43.078 --> 01:28:44.258]  Because of exposure.
[01:28:44.618 --> 01:28:53.202]  In fact, one of my people in New York gave me the information two weeks before it was going to break.
[01:28:53.402 --> 01:28:56.283]  And I named all the characters and everything else who were involved.
[01:28:57.164 --> 01:29:02.146]  And people in New York knew what was going on for a long time.
[01:29:02.982 --> 01:29:05.084]  But the FCC wasn't going to expose it.
[01:29:08.006 --> 01:29:24.659]  Right, so basically just another shocking example of how the people who are literally the financial terrorists are using this power to get the regulatory reform that the problems they created in the first place
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:27.581]  ...provided the environment for.
[01:29:27.601 --> 01:29:39.767]  I mean, again, it's the financial terrorists holding sway over the entire economy, and then we give them more power to run our lives, both financially, politically and socially.
[01:29:40.428 --> 01:29:41.448]  We're on the break.
[01:29:41.548 --> 01:29:45.350]  Now we're going to go to your calls for Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[01:29:46.031 --> 01:29:47.812]  Also want to talk a little bit about gold.
[01:29:48.372 --> 01:29:49.212]  So stay tuned.

[01:31:54.541 --> 01:31:54.841]  Thank you!
[01:31:59.261 --> 01:32:03.504]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:03.804 --> 01:32:04.424]  Number one.
[01:32:04.724 --> 01:32:07.866]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.147 --> 01:32:08.727]  Number two.
[01:32:09.007 --> 01:32:13.550]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:13.890 --> 01:32:14.351]  It's true.
[01:32:14.651 --> 01:32:19.214]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.514 --> 01:32:20.074]  Number three.
[01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:23.616]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:23.937 --> 01:32:27.619]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:27.819 --> 01:32:28.380]  Number 4.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.983]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.383 --> 01:32:34.768]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.068 --> 01:32:35.288]  Number 5.
[01:32:35.869 --> 01:32:39.794]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.014 --> 01:32:44.780]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.081]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.222 --> 01:32:50.782]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.002 --> 01:32:53.083]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.263 --> 01:32:55.604]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:01.481]  Federal agents!
[01:33:01.722 --> 01:33:03.885]  We are armed!
[01:33:17.945 --> 01:33:27.771]  We're talking with Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com on the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex today and tomorrow.
[01:33:28.351 --> 01:33:30.292]  Alex will be back later in the week.
[01:33:30.993 --> 01:33:38.777]  Now Bob, picking up with this theme of manipulation, I don't know if you saw this story or not, but it's certainly one that interested me.
[01:33:39.998 --> 01:33:44.861]  We had this strange incident whereby the spot price for gold
[01:33:45.641 --> 01:33:50.066]  Uh, suddenly jumped, and this occurred on the Yahoo Finance website.
[01:33:50.607 --> 01:33:55.752]  The spot price for gold suddenly jumped from, uh, $1,235 an ounce to, uh, a price of over $3,400 an ounce.
[01:33:55.772 --> 01:33:57.274]  You know, literally in the space of seconds.
[01:33:57.294 --> 01:33:57.334]  Um...
[01:34:04.702 --> 01:34:22.796]  I mean, people were raging with debate on the Kitco forums about whether this was a genuine harmless chart error or whether, you know, it was some kind of secret message being communicated to the insiders about potentially where the price of gold is heading.
[01:34:23.997 --> 01:34:36.222]  Number one, did you see this story and just talk a little bit about the manipulation of gold and if they use this kind of chart shenanigans to send these little inside messages to each other?
[01:34:38.322 --> 01:34:48.926]  Well, I don't know about the messages to one another, but usually when you have something like that happen, it's usually some sort of a digital error.
[01:34:51.067 --> 01:34:52.928]  I have noticed that over the years
[01:34:54.412 --> 01:35:07.714]  Some of the services have quoted prices that were away from the market, and you can understand that once in a while, because everybody makes mistakes.
[01:35:08.515 --> 01:35:21.537]  But there have been times when we have seen the quoting down of gold on a consistent basis.
[01:35:22.279 --> 01:35:41.408]  And so I've looked at that with a jaundiced eye, but the incident that you're talking to me about probably was just a error and the debate would surround perhaps things happening that shouldn't be happening and maybe it was a message.
[01:35:42.929 --> 01:35:47.251]  I tend to think that normally it was just a mistake.
[01:35:49.164 --> 01:35:55.867]  Yeah, that's the way I saw it, because, I mean, obviously the real stock price of gold was never at that level.
[01:35:55.907 --> 01:36:06.773]  It only occurred on this one website, unlike the flash crash with the Dow, which was obviously a real and sustained act of manipulation, as we were talking about earlier.
[01:36:06.793 --> 01:36:09.814]  We're going to go to the calls for Bob Chapman now.
[01:36:10.454 --> 01:36:12.235]  Please get your questions ready for Bob.
[01:36:12.335 --> 01:36:15.737]  And the first caller is Jimmy in Arizona.
[01:36:15.897 --> 01:36:17.638]  Jimmy, what's your question for Bob today?
[01:36:19.335 --> 01:36:19.855]  Thanks, Paul.
[01:36:19.875 --> 01:36:20.896]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:36:22.197 --> 01:36:24.138]  Bob, I hear you on a lot of these shows.
[01:36:24.158 --> 01:36:25.658]  I actually had a comment and a question.
[01:36:25.898 --> 01:36:28.380]  I didn't know that, Bob, that you had predicted 9-11.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.541]  That was news to me.
[01:36:30.561 --> 01:36:35.964]  I know Alex claims that, but I don't think either one of them are documentable, are they?
[01:36:37.084 --> 01:36:37.445]  Oh, yes.
[01:36:37.545 --> 01:36:38.725]  Mine is documentable.
[01:36:39.165 --> 01:36:40.646]  But I didn't call it 9-11.
[01:36:41.707 --> 01:36:47.670]  I just said that there would be an event that would happen sometime in the middle of October.
[01:36:48.524 --> 01:36:55.666]  And I was off by 33 days, I didn't name the event, and I made the call the previous November.
[01:36:56.586 --> 01:37:00.827]  And I also said that it would lead to the invasion of Iraq.
[01:37:01.688 --> 01:37:15.872]  And the reason why was that, as we discussed earlier in the program, they have events such as this that they create in order to have wars for distractions and other reasons besides that.
[01:37:16.532 --> 01:37:17.152]  Okay, I see.
[01:37:18.714 --> 01:37:37.277]  One of the other things I was going to ask you is that I hear you a lot on these, on a lot of the Patriot Talk radio shows, making the rounds, and I hear you make references, you know, using terms like Illuminati or Illuminus and the Elite, but my question is, why does it seem like you have difficulty naming the Jew?
[01:37:37.297 --> 01:37:40.158]  Naming the Jew?
[01:37:41.578 --> 01:37:42.058]  Which one?
[01:37:43.978 --> 01:37:47.419]  Instead of using terms like bankers and, you know,
[01:37:48.294 --> 01:37:53.198]  Some of these other generalized terms, international bankers, I mean, why don't we just come right out and say what it is?
[01:37:54.378 --> 01:37:56.300]  Well, they are international bankers.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.483]  They happen to belong to a group called the Illuminati.
[01:38:01.484 --> 01:38:08.869]  And there's a lot of other things that transpire besides banking within that genre, so to speak.
[01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:12.612]  And there are Jewish people who belong to it.
[01:38:13.567 --> 01:38:19.872]  Just like there are Christians and many other people who belong to what we call the International Bankers.
[01:38:20.913 --> 01:38:22.434]  Okay, thanks for your call, Jimmy.
[01:38:22.454 --> 01:38:25.196]  We're going to go to Vincent in North Carolina.
[01:38:25.256 --> 01:38:27.238]  Vincent, what's your question for Bob today?
[01:38:28.499 --> 01:38:30.840]  Yes, hi Paul and Bob.
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:37.445]  You'll have to forgive me, I called out today from work because I'm actually under the weather.
[01:38:39.168 --> 01:38:51.413]  Bob, I had actually corresponded with you over email and had talked to you on the radio before about the LaRouche Political Action Committee.
[01:38:51.433 --> 01:38:55.395]  I'm sure you probably remember some of those conversations over email.
[01:38:57.296 --> 01:39:04.619]  But they have an interesting platform that they're trying to run on and I thought it was very interesting.
[01:39:05.888 --> 01:39:30.758]  posted a video of the gentleman who was holding up the sign saying impeach Obama and of course he was held down on the ground for what reason I don't know but uh... uh... actually I've talked to some of the staff people I don't work for them but I've talked to some of their staff people and I've given them donations and what they're calling for is to get Obama to resign
[01:39:32.123 --> 01:39:56.234]  And interestingly enough, they're actually want to put in place a program, if this happens, that would start up a civil engineering project called, they call it the acronym is NAWAPA, which I don't know if I've got it correct, but it's the North American Water and Protection Act.
[01:39:56.634 --> 01:39:58.555]  I don't know if that's exact terminology.
[01:39:59.409 --> 01:40:19.696]  Basically, what it would do would be to irrigate water coming in from southeast Alaska, northwestern United States, and irrigate places in California, even as far inland as the deserts in the U.S., and even send water going to the Great Lakes.
[01:40:20.536 --> 01:40:27.539]  So what they wanted to do to combat this whole environmentalist movement of making everybody have to use
[01:40:28.673 --> 01:40:36.978]  Uh, solar panels everywhere and to heck with your farmland was to irrigate those areas so that it would change the biosphere.
[01:40:38.179 --> 01:40:45.304]  Unlike LaRouche, however, I know I've said it before, I'm not this great believer that FDR was this perfect president.
[01:40:45.924 --> 01:40:50.767]  I believe a lot of the policies he put in place actually exacerbated the depression.
[01:40:51.912 --> 01:41:00.058]  But he did do some good, I guess, civil engineering projects like TVA and so forth.
[01:41:01.299 --> 01:41:03.741]  What do you think of this idea?
[01:41:03.921 --> 01:41:13.368]  And also, the other thing he wanted to do was put in a Glass-Steagall Act and basically cancel off all the fraudulent debt from the derivatives.
[01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:16.871]  And I guess that's something I forgot to mention before.
[01:41:17.891 --> 01:41:20.794]  Can you comment on that and see what that
[01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:24.861]  How that would help America, or if it would?
[01:41:27.223 --> 01:41:39.412]  Glass-Steagall would be good, because it allowed the dividing line between banking, insurance, and the stock brokerage business.
[01:41:41.454 --> 01:41:50.881]  The termination of Glass-Steagall allowed them to be reunited, and Glass-Steagall was implemented in the early 1930s.
[01:41:52.885 --> 01:42:21.524]  uh... to uh... stop banking and Wall Street from doing what they were doing which was uh... using trust as well as uh... as the uh... uh... the merging uh... which had taken place during the nineteen twenties of uh... banking and insurance and and in part led to the disaster which was Wall Street in the nineteen thirties in nineteen ninety nine that was done away with
[01:42:22.273 --> 01:42:26.395]  And, yes, Glass-Steagall, I agree, should definitely be brought back.
[01:42:27.295 --> 01:42:36.558]  And, of course, Wall Street and banking, which control everything, along with the insurance and pharmaceutical and transnational corporations, they don't want that to happen.
[01:42:38.779 --> 01:42:49.723]  And they went in the opposite direction with the Financial Reform Act that you just saw passed, which makes the Fed Reserve a tyrannical force.
[01:42:50.852 --> 01:43:12.068]  But I believe, I agree with Lyndon LaRoche on that and I'm not against the water project and the jobs which it would bring about and not only was Roosevelt create the TVA and he also
[01:43:14.372 --> 01:43:28.422]  was responsible for thousands of projects throughout the country that we still use today, which included golf courses, which are close to my heart, and also the Boulder Dam.
[01:43:30.483 --> 01:43:31.704]  And so I'm not against that.
[01:43:31.724 --> 01:43:35.787]  If they're going to throw money away, they may as well use it in a constructive force.
[01:43:36.597 --> 01:43:41.321]  And that would also go along with fixing highways and bridges as well.
[01:43:41.842 --> 01:43:43.203]  But that's not what's going on.
[01:43:43.783 --> 01:43:50.549]  What's going on is money is being stuffed into the economy to save the bankers in Wall Street.
[01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:59.196]  And to some extent, FDR did that, and he shouldn't have done that.
[01:43:59.997 --> 01:44:04.561]  And as we talked about earlier in the program, the unemployment
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:12.224]  Uh, in 1939-40, was in the range between 17.4 and 16.2 percent.
[01:44:12.644 --> 01:44:17.368]  So he was only relatively successful, and they needed the war to bail themselves out.
[01:44:17.788 --> 01:44:19.969]  But Lyndon has some very good ideas.
[01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:26.254]  And I've been following him since 1964, when he was very socialistic at that time.
[01:44:26.954 --> 01:44:33.219]  And he has, uh, wandered, we'll call it, into the middle of the spectrum, which I think is wonderful.
[01:44:35.286 --> 01:44:36.988]  Okay, Tony, thanks for your call.
[01:44:37.008 --> 01:44:38.930]  We've got to move on because we've got a ton of callers.
[01:44:39.971 --> 01:44:49.640]  And yeah, we actually posted the arrest of the LaRouche supporter, which occurred a couple of weekends ago where he was holding this impeach Obama sign.
[01:44:50.281 --> 01:44:55.486]  And he was quickly, of course, taken down by Alaska's finest at the State Fair.
[01:44:55.526 --> 01:44:56.847]  No freedom of speech allowed.
[01:44:58.667 --> 01:45:05.931]  And we're taking your calls for Bob Chapman, Economist, TheInternationalForecaster.com at 800-259-9231.
[01:45:05.951 --> 01:45:11.013]  And now we're going to Sebastian in Portugal.
[01:45:11.073 --> 01:45:12.834]  Sebastian, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:45:12.854 --> 01:45:14.595]  Oh, hello.
[01:45:14.695 --> 01:45:15.616]  Hello to the two of you.
[01:45:16.496 --> 01:45:19.878]  I have two questions for Mr. Bob Chapman.
[01:45:20.878 --> 01:45:23.079]  Both dealing with my country, Portugal.
[01:45:23.139 --> 01:45:28.022]  I know he's familiar with the situation of the so-called pigs.
[01:45:29.437 --> 01:45:40.942]  Mr. Chapman, how likely do you think it is that in the foreseeable future the Portuguese economy will go into dire straits and collapse?
[01:45:41.343 --> 01:45:44.284]  And if so, what do you see happening?
[01:45:44.304 --> 01:45:50.147]  Do you think there's a possibility we might return to a dictatorship like we had a little over 30 years ago?
[01:45:50.867 --> 01:45:55.389]  And I know you've made some recommendations to the Greek people on what they should do.
[01:45:56.087 --> 01:45:58.169]  First of all, I don't see a return to dictatorship.
[01:45:58.269 --> 01:46:00.170]  I think that's out of the question.
[01:46:00.190 --> 01:46:04.233]  Second of all, the problems for Portugal are not as dire as they are in Greece.
[01:46:25.006 --> 01:46:31.729]  The Spanish and the Irish and the Italians have similar problems of varying degrees.
[01:46:32.650 --> 01:46:40.734]  But when you have insurmountable debt, the only way out is to default on that debt.
[01:46:41.454 --> 01:46:51.040]  And I think if Greece defaults, which I think they should, I think it should be a solid consideration for the countries I've just mentioned.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.401]  I know Portugal very well.
[01:46:54.128 --> 01:47:06.793]  I had a home in Elmencil on the golf course there and I spent a lot of time in Albufeira and Saro and of course in Lisbon and Abueto as well.
[01:47:07.433 --> 01:47:09.254]  And so I'm very familiar with the country.
[01:47:11.154 --> 01:47:20.258]  And so I think if, let's say what happens in Greece, the Greek government is going to
[01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:26.902]  Do a lot of laying off this month of September, and it's going to bring demonstrations.
[01:47:27.883 --> 01:47:40.806]  And we've had talk from responsible sources that there might be a coup, but a bloodless one, in driving the government out of power.
[01:47:41.606 --> 01:47:45.547]  And I personally, as an outsider, I think that's a good idea.
[01:47:46.448 --> 01:47:47.088]  And if the
[01:47:48.843 --> 01:47:56.161]  The financial situation in Portugal becomes as overwhelming as it is in Greece.
[01:47:56.582 --> 01:47:58.227]  I think they should consider the same thing.
[01:48:00.327 --> 01:48:22.473]  And we report out of Bilderberg back in June about how the globalists were basically in a blind panic about rescuing the euro because it basically represents their entire long-term agenda for global economic governance under the banner of this Bancor, World Bank, IMF currency.
[01:48:22.953 --> 01:48:28.975]  And of course if the euro was to go under then it would completely discredit the notion that
[01:48:29.395 --> 01:48:33.396]  Currencies that unite regional blocks are stable at all.
[01:48:33.776 --> 01:48:36.937]  It would prove that they are inherently unstable.
[01:48:37.398 --> 01:48:45.280]  So that's why Bilderberg resolved to rescue the euro when it was at its lowest point at the beginning of June, end of May.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:51.142]  And in fact, since that time, the euro has dramatically risen against the US dollar.
[01:48:51.182 --> 01:48:56.104]  It's down today, but in the long term, it's recovered a lot of ground against the dollar.
[01:48:57.664 --> 01:49:03.628]  We'll wait to see how that plays out with Portugal, Greece, and the debt default situation.
[01:49:04.248 --> 01:49:07.470]  We're going to move on to Steve in Arizona.
[01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:09.371]  Steve, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:49:11.412 --> 01:49:12.092]  Hi Bob, hey!
[01:49:12.853 --> 01:49:16.075]  Great job, and Paul, you're doing a great job filling in.
[01:49:17.876 --> 01:49:19.797]  And I have two questions for you, Bob.
[01:49:19.897 --> 01:49:25.300]  Number one, what is your newest forecast numbers for the unemployment in the United States?
[01:49:26.241 --> 01:49:37.063]  And number two, have you heard anything on the, uh, on the NASA, uh, I-4 Superhighway that's supposed to come through, uh, I hear Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, possibly Kansas?
[01:49:38.603 --> 01:49:44.844]  Well, first of all, it's, um, currently 21 and three-eighths percent real unemployment.
[01:49:44.884 --> 01:49:50.465]  That's U-6, uh, without the, uh, the, uh, birth-death ratio.
[01:49:51.086 --> 01:49:53.486]  As far as the, uh, North American,
[01:49:54.661 --> 01:50:08.806]  Alliance, we'll call it, and the highway, which is the melding or amalgamation of Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
[01:50:09.406 --> 01:50:11.566]  That's kind of on the back burner.
[01:50:11.947 --> 01:50:14.127]  Alex knows lots and lots about that.
[01:50:15.628 --> 01:50:18.549]  But they haven't given up, I can tell you that.
[01:50:19.069 --> 01:50:22.730]  But it has been stopped at the pass, so to speak.
[01:50:23.767 --> 01:50:44.233]  And unemployment, unfortunately, looks like it is going to head higher in the short term, although if they shove $2.5 trillion into the economy, which I think they're going to do over the next year, the unemployment would probably go down a little bit, but it's not going to go down much.
[01:50:45.534 --> 01:50:49.875]  Okay, we'll be back after the break, going to more of your calls with Bob Chapman.
[01:50:49.895 --> 01:50:52.496]  Stay tuned to the Alex Jones Show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:00.632 --> 01:51:02.714]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:51:03.154 --> 01:51:06.256]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:51:06.716 --> 01:51:14.702]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:51:15.202 --> 01:51:20.086]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food.
[01:51:20.686 --> 01:51:25.809]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:51:26.309 --> 01:51:33.833]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[01:51:34.353 --> 01:51:39.336]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:51:39.796 --> 01:51:41.057]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:51:41.617 --> 01:51:47.081]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.

[01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:01.890]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:07.294]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.534 --> 01:52:12.157]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.557 --> 01:52:12.958]  It's true.
[01:52:13.018 --> 01:52:17.601]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.121 --> 01:52:22.824]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.345 --> 01:52:25.266]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:25.666 --> 01:52:30.269]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.469 --> 01:52:31.350]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:34.352]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.652 --> 01:52:37.954]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.275 --> 01:52:41.116]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:52:48.241 --> 01:52:50.023]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:51.204 --> 01:52:56.988]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.309 --> 01:52:59.691]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.683 --> 01:53:03.844]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:53:04.224 --> 01:53:06.044]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:53:06.504 --> 01:53:06.904]  Don't!
[01:53:07.364 --> 01:53:10.405]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:54:20.132 --> 01:54:25.397]  I'll be back tomorrow in Alex's place, and Alex will be back from his project in a few days.
[01:54:25.837 --> 01:54:28.300]  Talking to Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:35.624]  Bob, just quickly, I've seen several of the CNBC talking heads being down on gold again.
[01:54:36.404 --> 01:54:42.388]  We nearly touched the record high today of £12.65 an ounce for gold.
[01:54:42.848 --> 01:54:45.469]  Where do you see gold going in the short term?
[01:54:45.509 --> 01:54:49.091]  Is it still a good time for people to get on board with precious metals?
[01:54:50.372 --> 01:54:55.275]  Well, first of all, September is a wonderful month for gold and silver.
[01:54:55.999 --> 01:54:59.262]  They're up 81% of the stock time historically.
[01:54:59.802 --> 01:55:01.784]  So that's a good omen, so to speak.
[01:55:02.504 --> 01:55:04.246]  I see much higher prices here.
[01:55:04.706 --> 01:55:13.273]  I think we got a shot at $1,500 to $1,650 and $25 to $30 on silver before the end of the year.
[01:55:13.873 --> 01:55:15.975]  And next year I see it higher as well.
[01:55:16.515 --> 01:55:19.858]  We should see a good market into the end of February.
[01:55:20.418 --> 01:55:21.979]  And so I'm very optimistic.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:23.601]  I think the
[01:55:25.562 --> 01:55:33.925]  The market is just telling us we want to go upward, and that's in gold and silver, and nothing's going to stop it.
[01:55:34.766 --> 01:55:48.492]  The government that's been suppressing prices for so long have been very unsuccessful as of late in holding it down, and I think gold and silver were just waiting for the end of the
[01:55:51.969 --> 01:55:52.109]  Yes.
[01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:26.218]  There's a company coming into my community, Liberty Green, and their major investor is Macquarie Group from Australia, and I was curious as to what Bob could tell me about them.
[01:56:26.518 --> 01:56:30.681]  They're the same company that bought the toll roads in northern Indiana.
[01:56:33.023 --> 01:56:35.644]  Some of the financing I don't quite understand.
[01:56:36.905 --> 01:56:44.851]  The interest on some of the stuff they have to pay back is billed at the end, so they're not really making money in the beginning.
[01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.650]  I don't
[01:57:17.156 --> 01:57:30.963]  Well, Macquarie has been involved also, along with the Spanish group, in the financing, the proposed financing of this NAFTA highway.
[01:57:31.783 --> 01:57:33.584]  And you probably are aware of that.
[01:57:34.564 --> 01:57:35.845]  Maybe other people were not.
[01:57:36.505 --> 01:57:46.330]  And it's a large banking group in Australia that gets some of their funding, obviously, through retirement funds that are available in Australia.
[01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:59.636]  They've been partners and financiers of the toll roads and some of the sections of the country, and in other countries as well.
[01:58:00.417 --> 01:58:16.401]  And they're looking for a long-term stream of income, and they're also looking for the privatization of, or taking advantage of the privatization of these projects which are needed, or at least
[01:58:17.034 --> 01:58:19.635]  Those people think they are needed politically.
[01:58:19.656 --> 01:58:20.996]  Okay.
[01:58:21.376 --> 01:58:21.997]  Thanks, Bob.
[01:58:22.277 --> 01:58:23.137]  We're out of time.
[01:58:23.398 --> 01:58:25.559]  Bob Chapman, InternationalForecaster.com.
[01:58:26.059 --> 01:58:31.482]  Jeff, Shawn, Michael, call back tomorrow when we've got Gerald Salenti on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:31.502 --> 01:58:33.883]  Stay tuned for the Obama deception.
[01:58:34.423 --> 01:58:35.724]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:43.288 --> 01:58:44.589]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.269 --> 01:58:48.531]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.912 --> 01:58:50.673]  Listen up, friends.
[01:58:50.713 --> 01:58:52.675]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:58:53.055 --> 01:58:56.578]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:58:56.859 --> 01:58:59.501]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:58:59.741 --> 01:59:04.666]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:05.106 --> 01:59:10.728]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:59:11.048 --> 01:59:16.389]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:59:16.710 --> 01:59:20.991]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:29.373]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:59:29.733 --> 01:59:31.514]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:59:31.934 --> 01:59:33.995]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[01:59:53.123 --> 01:59:55.044]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.505 --> 01:59:58.266]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.017 --> 02:00:05.637]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.317 --> 02:00:07.338]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.078 --> 02:00:09.179]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.839 --> 02:00:10.639]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.399 --> 02:00:12.320]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:16.641]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.161 --> 02:00:21.263]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.044 --> 02:00:26.925]  Contrary to the rumors that you've heard, I was not born in a manger.
[02:00:28.685 --> 02:00:32.247]  I was actually born on Krypton, and...
[02:00:33.493 --> 02:00:35.534]  I'm sent here to save the planet Earth.
[02:00:38.836 --> 02:00:45.981]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[02:00:47.642 --> 02:00:51.584]  Everybody somewhere between the ages of 18-25 will serve three months of basic training.
[02:00:51.685 --> 02:00:56.988]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong.
[02:00:57.588 --> 02:00:58.329]  Yes we can!
[02:01:00.563 --> 02:01:03.664]  Obama's health care plan will include COVID and provide safety and medical services.
[02:01:04.004 --> 02:01:05.085]  Yes, we hear it!
[02:01:05.525 --> 02:01:06.906]  Obama is a cruel hoax.
[02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:08.386]  He works for Wall Street.
[02:01:08.666 --> 02:01:10.627]  He's an agent of finance capital.
[02:01:11.047 --> 02:01:13.929]  Where did you come up with the number $700 billion?
[02:01:14.009 --> 02:01:15.969]  Here's the Treasury spokeswoman's quote.
[02:01:16.630 --> 02:01:18.590]  It's not based on any particular data point.
[02:01:18.631 --> 02:01:20.951]  We just really wanted to come up with a really big number.
[02:01:21.392 --> 02:01:24.373]  To Democrats and Republicans who've opposed this plan,
[02:01:25.450 --> 02:01:27.711]  I say, step up to the plate.
[02:01:27.911 --> 02:01:33.632]  A few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[02:01:34.053 --> 02:01:37.754]  Secretary Henry Paulson is no George Washington.
[02:01:37.994 --> 02:01:44.536]  I don't think anyone questions, Mr. Kashkari, that you're working hard.
[02:01:46.236 --> 02:01:49.057]  Our question is who you're working for.
[02:01:52.853 --> 02:02:00.297]  Obama pledged that he would resume the security and prosperity partnership talks between Mexico and Canada that President Bush initiated.
[02:02:00.698 --> 02:02:02.879]  The old boss is starting to look a lot like the new boss.
[02:02:03.099 --> 02:02:07.701]  Robert Gates is going to remain on the job as Defense Secretary for at least a year.
[02:02:08.002 --> 02:02:15.386]  Plenty of sources knew about this meeting, told us and others that it was at Hillary Clinton's house, but clearly it wasn't.
[02:02:17.765 --> 02:02:23.170]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:02:24.031 --> 02:02:29.956]  We see you causing a depression so you can blow out the economy and consolidate it and bankrupt it.
[02:02:29.976 --> 02:02:35.882]  We know that you are enemies of free humanity and we are here standing against your tyranny!
[02:02:43.703 --> 02:02:44.985]  The Obama deception.
[02:02:45.405 --> 02:02:46.807]  The truth strikes back.
[02:02:51.212 --> 02:02:59.602]  Barack is like the manager of Burger King.
[02:03:01.144 --> 02:03:03.027]  All presidents are, including Bush!
[02:03:04.867 --> 02:03:19.404]  It's like this, when your fries are cold, if your burger's not done right, you go back to Burger King America, or your government, and you say, my burger's cold, I want new fries.
[02:03:19.985 --> 02:03:23.569]  First, you go to the cashier, that's the courts.
[02:03:25.185 --> 02:03:26.886]  You argue to the courts.
[02:03:27.847 --> 02:03:32.951]  The courts, if you can't get no justice with the cashier, you say, let me see the manager.
[02:03:33.572 --> 02:03:35.133]  I want to go to the Supreme Court.
[02:03:35.554 --> 02:03:37.095]  I want to see the president.
[02:03:38.296 --> 02:03:39.497]  The manager comes out.
[02:03:40.238 --> 02:03:42.359]  Hi, what can I do for you?
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:46.122]  Now the manager can override the decisions of the cashier.
[02:03:47.188 --> 02:03:52.473]  But you never get to see the franchise owner of Burger King.
[02:03:52.573 --> 02:03:58.078]  If you really have a problem with your burger, you need to go see the franchise owner.
[02:03:58.198 --> 02:03:59.659]  We need to go to the top.
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:01.281]  Or to the bottom.
[02:04:03.655 --> 02:04:09.140]  We need to go to where the real architecture of government is.
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:11.742]  And it's not in a precedent.
[02:04:12.302 --> 02:04:14.824]  It's in a global scheme.
[02:04:15.945 --> 02:04:19.248]  Politics in America today is identical to pro wrestling.
[02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:25.714]  And what I mean by that is, in front of the cameras and the public, we all hate each other.
[02:04:26.733 --> 02:04:28.653]  I'm going to kick my opponent's butt.
[02:04:28.794 --> 02:04:32.494]  I'm going to wail him from here to high water and beat the crap out of him.
[02:04:32.814 --> 02:04:36.075]  Yet behind the scenes, we all have friends going out to dinner.
[02:04:36.155 --> 02:04:37.296]  Went to dinner together.
[02:04:37.696 --> 02:04:38.836]  And it's all a work.
[02:04:38.996 --> 02:04:39.516]  All intermarried.
[02:04:39.556 --> 02:04:40.216]  It's show business.
[02:04:40.536 --> 02:04:41.357]  It's show business.
[02:04:41.797 --> 02:04:43.737]  And that's what you have today in politics.
[02:04:43.817 --> 02:04:46.978]  The Democrats and Republicans aren't really opposed to each other.
[02:05:04.153 --> 02:05:05.074]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:05.414 --> 02:05:09.137]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.277 --> 02:05:11.579]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:11.599 --> 02:05:17.063]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:17.463 --> 02:05:23.688]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.108 --> 02:05:29.630]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.070 --> 02:05:33.751]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:34.271 --> 02:05:38.232]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:38.552 --> 02:05:44.074]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:44.494 --> 02:05:47.455]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.055 --> 02:05:49.496]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.036 --> 02:05:50.456]  It's here.

[02:06:00.683 --> 02:06:15.174]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:06:16.175 --> 02:06:19.838]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:20.836 --> 02:06:32.868]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:06:33.608 --> 02:06:40.875]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[02:08:05.839 --> 02:08:08.121]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:11.561 --> 02:08:13.281]  Hello my fellow Infowarriors.
[02:08:13.341 --> 02:08:14.442]  Thank you for tuning in.
[02:08:14.582 --> 02:08:17.162]  It is Tuesday, the 7th day of September 2010.
[02:08:18.162 --> 02:08:24.483]  I appreciate you tuning in to the live transmission of Paul Joseph Watson, joining us from Britannia.
[02:08:25.304 --> 02:08:31.185]  I, of course, am on assignment with Governor Jesse Ventura, but I'll be back in the next few days.
[02:08:31.565 --> 02:08:34.865]  Hope you had a great Labor Day holiday weekend.
[02:08:34.905 --> 02:08:36.626]  Everything went safe and was well.
[02:08:37.126 --> 02:08:38.586]  We're going to do something a little different
[02:08:38.686 --> 02:08:38.846]  Yes.
[02:08:56.354 --> 02:09:04.161]  From the award-winning documentary film, The Obama Deception, watched more than 30 million times online, thanks to you spreading the word.
[02:09:04.401 --> 02:09:09.626]  You can also get the DVD with expanded extras and support our operation at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:09.946 --> 02:09:11.648]  And now, The Obama Deception.
[02:09:22.327 --> 02:09:29.431]  It's pretty obvious that there's some gigantic financial institutions that have been pulling the strings of politicians in this country for a long time.
[02:09:29.811 --> 02:09:36.675]  And just the fact that we have it set up where they can donate millions of dollars to these guys' funds, these guys' campaigns.
[02:09:37.015 --> 02:09:39.816]  I mean, how do we not expect it all to go bad?
[02:09:42.078 --> 02:09:46.000]  America in 2009 was desperate for change.
[02:09:47.821 --> 02:09:49.802]  The past eight years have been a disaster.
[02:09:50.663 --> 02:09:54.226]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[02:09:54.266 --> 02:09:54.947]  Maybe under here.
[02:10:04.675 --> 02:10:16.344]  George W. Bush, who had claimed to be a conservative, had tripled the size of the federal government, shredded the Constitution, and destroyed the image of the United States worldwide.
[02:10:16.645 --> 02:10:17.826]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:23.480]  Endless wars.
[02:10:24.841 --> 02:10:26.421]  Over a million dead Iraqis.
[02:10:27.841 --> 02:10:30.142]  And more than 5,000 dead U.S.
[02:10:30.202 --> 02:10:30.562]  troops.
[02:10:32.122 --> 02:10:33.003]  The Patriot Act.
[02:10:35.263 --> 02:10:37.824]  Warrantless domestic wiretapping and spying.
[02:10:39.584 --> 02:10:41.265]  The end of Posse Comitatus.
[02:10:42.985 --> 02:10:45.286]  The rise of the treasonous North American Union.
[02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:52.184]  A deepening recession, sliding towards total economic collapse.
[02:10:53.805 --> 02:11:01.230]  These factors and other abuses had the American people in a state of panic for their future and the very existence of the United States.
[02:11:03.692 --> 02:11:04.913]  The elite were in trouble.
[02:11:05.473 --> 02:11:11.978]  The people were beginning to see through their facade, past their front man, and to the ruling elite behind the throne.
[02:11:14.502 --> 02:11:15.764]  For the first time in U.S.
[02:11:15.824 --> 02:11:18.747]  history, both parties were universally hated.
[02:11:19.167 --> 02:11:21.190]  Congress had a 9% approval rating.
[02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:23.793]  The globalist agenda had stalled.
[02:11:26.576 --> 02:11:30.501]  And then, onto the scene came a man who promised change.
[02:11:31.021 --> 02:11:33.104]  Change we could all believe in.
[02:11:34.494 --> 02:11:39.157]  Barack H. Obama promised to end the war and bring our troops home fast.
[02:11:39.717 --> 02:11:45.621]  He pledged to uphold the Constitution and to stop the federal government from spying on the American people.
[02:11:46.021 --> 02:11:50.764]  Candidate Obama told American workers that he was going to get them out of NAFTA and GATT.
[02:11:51.625 --> 02:11:54.007]  And he's already breaking those promises.
[02:11:55.501 --> 02:12:00.104]  In this film we will prove that Obama says one thing and does another.
[02:12:00.124 --> 02:12:04.206]  And that he works for the very same elite interest that Bush served.
[02:12:04.827 --> 02:12:11.551]  The very interest engineering the financial collapse and formation of a dictatorial world government.
[02:12:13.297 --> 02:12:15.418]  This film is not about left or right.
[02:12:15.778 --> 02:12:16.758]  It is nonpartisan.
[02:12:17.258 --> 02:12:25.220]  Our past documentary films are among some of the most damning indictments of George W. Bush and his administration that have ever been made.
[02:12:29.161 --> 02:12:38.243]  If humanity has any hope of effecting real change for the better, it will not come from the Madison Avenue false reality makers who have cast Barack Obama as the savior of the world.
[02:12:41.195 --> 02:12:49.119]  To alter our course from tyranny to liberty, to defeat the corrupt elite, we must get past the puppets and confront the real power structure of the planet.
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:54.821]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[02:12:56.002 --> 02:12:59.943]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[02:13:00.303 --> 02:13:04.145]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is an accomplished geopolitical analyst and historian.
[02:13:04.445 --> 02:13:10.268]  Among his scholarly works are the unauthorized biographies of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:13:11.733 --> 02:13:21.760]  Since Bush, the elder, made a speech at the United Nations back in September of 1990 talking about the New World Order, I think I've become confused about what's actually going on in the world.
[02:13:22.441 --> 02:13:28.785]  The New World Order is a more palatable name for the Anglo-American world empire.
[02:13:28.825 --> 02:13:34.049]  It's the planetary domination of London, New York, Washington, over the rest of the world.
[02:13:34.469 --> 02:13:40.333]  It's hard to get people to join that or think they have a part in it if you call it the Anglo-American world empire.
[02:13:40.433 --> 02:13:40.914]  If you call it
[02:13:41.494 --> 02:13:44.955]  Combines of powerful men have always battled with each other over the levers of power.
[02:14:10.086 --> 02:14:16.688]  Gerald Salente is recognized as one of the world's foremost trends forecasters and as the founder of the Trends Research Institute.
[02:14:17.428 --> 02:14:28.931]  People that are knowledgeable know that the fight that this country has been waging since its inception is for the central bankers not to take over the country.
[02:14:31.192 --> 02:14:33.693]  And that's why people like Andrew Jackson were elected.
[02:14:33.973 --> 02:14:37.554]  And that's why people revere people like Thomas Jefferson and others.
[02:14:38.834 --> 02:14:39.994]  The takeover's happened.
[02:14:40.775 --> 02:14:42.115]  And it's a corporate takeover.
[02:14:43.255 --> 02:14:53.478]  Agents of the Bank of England attempted to assassinate President Andrew Jackson on multiple occasions because of his resistance against a private central bank being set up in the United States.
[02:14:55.279 --> 02:14:57.479]  And it was something that Abraham Lincoln warned.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:01.821]  And this is, by the way, why I believe he was assassinated.
[02:15:02.241 --> 02:15:03.321]  This is the Lincoln quote.
[02:15:04.824 --> 02:15:11.846]  The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity.
[02:15:11.866 --> 02:15:21.668]  It is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucracy.
[02:15:22.689 --> 02:15:30.951]  I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country.
[02:15:32.338 --> 02:15:34.479]  Corporations have been enthroned.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:52.831]  An era of corruption will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.
[02:15:53.751 --> 02:15:56.233]  Wall Street has killed Main Street.
[02:15:57.580 --> 02:16:01.566]  So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now.
[02:16:02.227 --> 02:16:05.272]  Especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions.
[02:16:05.712 --> 02:16:06.794]  I promise you, I get it.
[02:16:07.757 --> 02:16:15.802]  Up until about the Kennedy assassination and the beginning of the war in Vietnam, the United States is a very powerful engine for world progress.
[02:16:15.862 --> 02:16:26.750]  It's the assassinations, the Kennedy assassination, and the others in the 1960s, the beginning of the Vietnam War, and the beginning of the absolute domination of the Wall Street group over every other interest.
[02:16:27.110 --> 02:16:30.012]  Nobody else counts except the Wall Street money masters.
[02:16:30.372 --> 02:16:36.016]  That has now made the United States into no longer a force for progress, but something very different.
[02:16:36.076 --> 02:16:37.637]  Often a force for destruction in the world.
[02:16:37.937 --> 02:16:44.000]  The military industrial complex has taken over the country along with the Wall Street gang.
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:50.883]  If you look also at the people that Obama has put on his appointments list, it's all Wall Street.
[02:16:50.963 --> 02:16:54.365]  It's government of Wall Street, by Wall Street, and for Wall Street.
[02:16:54.785 --> 02:16:56.666]  There's nobody from heavy industry.
[02:16:56.946 --> 02:16:58.727]  There's nobody from the auto sector.
[02:16:59.087 --> 02:17:00.528]  Nobody from Silicon Valley.
[02:17:00.828 --> 02:17:02.008]  Nobody from big oil.
[02:17:02.308 --> 02:17:03.469]  Nobody from defense.
[02:17:03.929 --> 02:17:04.609]  No labor.
[02:17:04.749 --> 02:17:05.289]  No women.
[02:17:05.609 --> 02:17:06.550]  No retirees.
[02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:07.650]  No small business.
[02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:08.270]  Nothing.
[02:17:08.610 --> 02:17:09.810]  It's pure Wall Street.
[02:17:10.051 --> 02:17:15.612]  The only people who have a voice in Obama's councils are Wall Street finance oligarchs.
[02:17:15.652 --> 02:17:16.712]  That's all there is.
[02:17:16.932 --> 02:17:19.493]  Nobody else counts for anything under Obama.
[02:17:19.513 --> 02:17:22.774]  It's the most extreme Wall Street administration we've ever had.
[02:17:24.281 --> 02:17:37.609]  Before his death, President Woodrow Wilson apologized to the public, regretting that he had been deceived by a group of international bankers and the country's financial system had fallen into their iron grip via the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.
[02:17:38.930 --> 02:17:49.676]  Whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex, the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:17:49.836 --> 02:17:51.017]  Dwight D. Eisenhower,
[02:17:51.767 --> 02:17:57.790]  He warned the people that the military-industrial complex was taking over the country.
[02:17:58.070 --> 02:18:07.914]  Only three years after leaving office, President Eisenhower's prophetic warning concerning the threat posed to our system of government by the military-industrial complex came to pass.
[02:18:09.735 --> 02:18:13.016]  President John F. Kennedy had enraged the entire elite network.
[02:18:14.212 --> 02:18:17.574]  Now, Kennedy was brought in as somebody who was expected to be a puppet.
[02:18:17.614 --> 02:18:28.062]  It was thought that his pro-Nazi father, Joseph P. Kennedy, the bootlegger, the speculator, would guarantee that Kennedy would be obedient to the establishment.
[02:18:28.522 --> 02:18:39.430]  They thought that Kennedy was a sex maniac who could be manipulated through all of this, but it turned out that through his personal suffering, Kennedy had discovered a personal sense of himself which went beyond just being
[02:18:39.870 --> 02:18:51.701]  A puppet, and he began to think about things like economic recovery, world peace, having a space program, making deals with the Soviets, cutting the Federal Reserve down to size, and a whole series of other things.
[02:18:52.061 --> 02:18:59.748]  Executive order number 11110, signed by President Kennedy, began the process of abolishing the private Federal Reserve.
[02:19:00.088 --> 02:19:05.974]  Kennedy was also pushing for real civil rights reform, and had begun the process of pulling the troops out of Vietnam.
[02:19:07.685 --> 02:19:11.469]  The last time you had an actual president was Kennedy.
[02:19:12.209 --> 02:19:15.052]  The oligarchs took swift and decisive action.
[02:19:16.474 --> 02:19:21.759]  When John Kennedy attempted to take the government back from the robber barons, he was brutally murdered.
[02:19:22.459 --> 02:19:23.841]  The message to future U.S.
[02:19:23.881 --> 02:19:26.303]  presidents and leaders across the world was clear.
[02:19:27.044 --> 02:19:28.645]  Do as you're told or die.
[02:19:30.149 --> 02:19:34.032]  John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the last true president of the United States.
[02:19:34.813 --> 02:19:38.837]  And until the globalists are removed from power, we will never have another real one.
[02:20:00.746 --> 02:20:03.607]  Off-the-grid remedies can still be grown in your own backyard.
[02:20:03.747 --> 02:20:11.351]  Tap into powerful off-the-grid healthcare using all-natural, time-tested herbal medications that you grow yourself with the new Survival Herb Bank.

[02:20:17.133 --> 02:20:24.519]  Traditional herbal remedies have been used effectively for centuries, but the big pharmaceutical and big government cartel can't patent their natural healing powers.
[02:20:24.619 --> 02:20:26.400]  That's why they are trying to ban them.
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:31.904]  The Survival Herb Bank contains 20 powerful herbs, all with proven track records as off-the-grid remedies.

[02:21:00.407 --> 02:21:02.908]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[02:21:03.168 --> 02:21:05.149]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[02:21:05.209 --> 02:21:05.909]  debt crises.
[02:21:06.109 --> 02:21:06.890]  You heard me right.
[02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:09.571]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[02:21:09.611 --> 02:21:12.992]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[02:21:13.272 --> 02:21:20.135]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[02:21:20.655 --> 02:21:21.796]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:21.916 --> 02:21:28.919]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:21:29.099 --> 02:21:36.503]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[02:21:36.923 --> 02:21:40.685]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[02:21:40.885 --> 02:21:42.926]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[02:21:42.946 --> 02:21:44.967]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[02:21:45.127 --> 02:21:47.188]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[02:21:47.208 --> 02:21:47.488]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:05.273]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:05.373 --> 02:22:06.154]  What have we got?
[02:22:06.374 --> 02:22:08.495]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:08.815 --> 02:22:09.556]  A republic.
[02:22:09.836 --> 02:22:12.417]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:12.478 --> 02:22:14.399]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:14.739 --> 02:22:16.640]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:18.041]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:18.441 --> 02:22:19.562]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:19.762 --> 02:22:20.162]  Children?
[02:22:20.382 --> 02:22:21.163]  Our education?
[02:22:21.503 --> 02:22:22.143]  Our money?
[02:22:22.324 --> 02:22:25.986]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:26.346 --> 02:22:29.991]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:30.051 --> 02:22:30.993]  You are being warned.
[02:22:31.313 --> 02:22:32.134]  We have the facts.
[02:22:32.334 --> 02:22:33.456]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:33.496 --> 02:22:34.377]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:34.397 --> 02:22:35.238]  We have common law.
[02:22:35.298 --> 02:22:37.541]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:37.822 --> 02:22:40.525]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:22:40.766 --> 02:22:41.587]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:41.687 --> 02:22:46.473]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:46.653 --> 02:22:48.015]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:48.155 --> 02:22:48.996]  Don't tread on me.
[02:22:49.236 --> 02:22:56.104]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:23:02.076 --> 02:23:03.520]  What is a wind generator?
[02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:05.885]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:23:06.226 --> 02:23:09.254]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:23:09.594 --> 02:23:11.539]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[02:23:16.149 --> 02:23:18.930]  Did you know the wind can provide your family with emergency power?

[02:24:08.044 --> 02:24:13.626]  The other thing about the American president you've got to remember is that this is a puppet post.
[02:24:14.046 --> 02:24:15.847]  It's automatically going to be a puppet post.
[02:24:16.207 --> 02:24:26.110]  The idea that Obama is somebody who's going to come in and exercise real authority when he's obviously been chosen and given everything that he's got by these financiers.
[02:24:26.890 --> 02:24:34.993]  Presidents are now little more than corporate pitchmen who take all the political heat while the controllers remain in the shadows, safe from public scrutiny.
[02:24:36.229 --> 02:24:40.633]  Hip-hop icon KRS-One is not just known for selling millions of albums.
[02:24:40.973 --> 02:24:45.757]  He has led a tireless crusade against youth violence and has been a strong voice for human rights.
[02:24:46.278 --> 02:24:53.264]  If they controlled it before, what makes you think they're not controlling it now?
[02:24:53.784 --> 02:24:57.047]  The country was on a verge of revolution.
[02:24:57.988 --> 02:24:59.349]  They threw a black man up.
[02:24:59.950 --> 02:25:00.991]  Now we like this.
[02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:08.335]  They give them the money, they give them the bundling, they give them vote fraud.
[02:25:09.201 --> 02:25:10.522]  They give him the media whores.
[02:25:10.882 --> 02:25:11.783]  They give him goons.
[02:25:11.823 --> 02:25:17.647]  They even have elected officials making threats to put people in jail if they criticize Obama in public.
[02:25:18.187 --> 02:25:19.868]  All of this is the mark of a puppet.
[02:25:20.989 --> 02:25:23.070]  And that means that he is a puppet.
[02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:24.992]  Actually more of a puppet than anybody else.
[02:25:25.112 --> 02:25:27.053]  More of a puppet than Mrs. Clinton would have been.
[02:25:27.513 --> 02:25:29.455]  Even more of a puppet than McCain.
[02:25:29.735 --> 02:25:33.998]  He's the maximum puppet that we've had certainly since Jimmy Carter.
[02:25:39.481 --> 02:25:40.681]  KRS ain't buying it!
[02:25:41.262 --> 02:25:46.263]  In the real executive power structure, the president serves the military-industrial complex.
[02:25:46.923 --> 02:25:48.983]  It's self-owned by the international bankers.
[02:25:49.764 --> 02:25:53.664]  If there's a revolution, the population just throws out the prime minister or president.
[02:25:54.205 --> 02:25:59.266]  The elite stays in power because the public is never aware of who the real enemy is.
[02:26:00.186 --> 02:26:15.336]  In Evian, France in 1991, standing before the Bilderberg Group, the apex of the world government power structure, David Rockefeller defined the New World Order as a system of world government serving the international banking elite.
[02:26:15.897 --> 02:26:28.866]  For decades, the banker-owned media would attack anyone who dared to warn the public that a dictatorial world government was being constructed right under their nose, and that national sovereignty was being deliberately destroyed.
[02:26:30.808 --> 02:26:45.154]  And now, after years of denial, the media and the elite themselves are proudly announcing that not only is world government real, but it is the answer to the financial crisis that they carefully engineered.
[02:26:46.775 --> 02:26:56.038]  Suddenly, the Wall Street Journal tells us that the North American Union is here, and that getting rid of the dollar for a common currency with Canada and Mexico is good.
[02:26:58.259 --> 02:27:13.789]  The Financial Times of London, published by a member of the Bilderberg Group, crowed that a dictatorial world government had been kept in the shadows for our own good, and that it was now time for it to emerge from behind the curtains of national security.
[02:27:14.849 --> 02:27:20.353]  White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel stated on record that they can't let this crisis go to waste.
[02:27:21.533 --> 02:27:23.855]  You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.
[02:27:25.063 --> 02:27:29.166]  What I mean by that, it's an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.
[02:27:30.327 --> 02:27:41.534]  And Henry Kissinger, who gave Barack Obama his first job out of college, told national television that the economic collapse was a great opportunity to bring in the New World Order.
[02:27:41.895 --> 02:27:46.538]  He went on to say that Barack Obama was the perfect person to sell it to the world.
[02:27:47.098 --> 02:27:49.420]  He can give a new impetus.
[02:27:50.507 --> 02:27:57.590]  To American foreign policy, partly because the reception of him is so extraordinary around the world.
[02:27:57.850 --> 02:28:07.335]  I think his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period, when really a new world order can be created.
[02:28:07.415 --> 02:28:08.515]  It's a great opportunity.
[02:28:08.535 --> 02:28:11.077]  It isn't just a crisis.
[02:28:12.337 --> 02:28:19.384]  In June of 2006, our team traveled to Ottawa, Canada to gather intelligence on the shadow government's agenda for the coming years.
[02:28:19.405 --> 02:28:22.628]  I think that's the Queen!
[02:28:25.350 --> 02:28:30.636]  Investigative journalist and best-selling author Daniel Estelin had been tracking the Bilderberg Group for more than 16 years.
[02:28:33.775 --> 02:28:41.542]  His moles inside Bilderberg informed him that the elite were planning to first run the price of gas up to $150 a barrel.
[02:28:41.903 --> 02:28:43.544]  Unimaginable in 2006.
[02:28:44.585 --> 02:28:54.315]  He also reported that after suckering the middle class back into the stock market, the group was going to implode the subprime mortgage market and destroy public confidence.
[02:28:56.175 --> 02:29:03.099]  Well, one of the things that, you know, we're getting from this morning and this afternoon's conference, this morning's conference was about the energy crisis, the press of oil.
[02:29:03.199 --> 02:29:12.524]  The afternoon conference, which started about 4 o'clock, 4-4-30, they were talking about one of the American delegates, I wasn't told who exactly it was, was talking about the
[02:29:13.784 --> 02:29:19.729]  The concern that the American citizens have had with the housing prices going down, so they're not investing that money.
[02:29:19.749 --> 02:29:23.512]  So what they needed to do is they needed to create the illusion that everything is going well.
[02:29:23.552 --> 02:29:28.615]  So what they're going to do over the next year, year and a half, is to bring the market back up to 1998, 1999 levels.
[02:29:28.755 --> 02:29:32.658]  They're going to get all the suckers to invest whatever little money they have left over.
[02:29:33.959 --> 02:29:36.882]  And that's when they're going to make the economy bottom drop out.
[02:29:36.942 --> 02:29:51.595]  They need to destroy the economy, because as we're running out of oil, when people don't travel, at least that's what they're saying, when people don't travel, when people don't have money, they don't travel, they don't... We're on the march.
[02:29:52.096 --> 02:29:53.697]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.638 --> 02:29:57.341]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.909 --> 02:30:04.132]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.452 --> 02:30:05.073]  Number one.
[02:30:05.373 --> 02:30:08.515]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:08.796 --> 02:30:09.376]  Number two.
[02:30:09.656 --> 02:30:14.220]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:15.000]  It's true.
[02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:19.844]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.164 --> 02:30:20.704]  Number three.
[02:30:20.985 --> 02:30:24.287]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:24.567 --> 02:30:28.270]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:28.470 --> 02:30:29.030]  Number 4.
[02:30:29.271 --> 02:30:31.632]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.032 --> 02:30:35.414]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:35.714 --> 02:30:35.914]  Number 5.
[02:30:36.495 --> 02:30:40.417]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:40.637 --> 02:30:45.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:31:03.944 --> 02:31:09.988]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:10.368 --> 02:31:17.453]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:17.753 --> 02:31:22.316]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:32:55.954 --> 02:32:56.695]  Check them out today.
[02:33:09.847 --> 02:33:13.351]  The Bilderberg Group sits at the top of the world power structure.
[02:33:13.371 --> 02:33:19.437]  125 of the richest and most influential individuals on the globe make up its membership.
[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:27.907]  From Istanbul, Turkey to Chantilly, Virginia, we have tracked the elusive Bilderberg Group.
[02:33:31.690 --> 02:33:34.932]  Bilderberg always insists on a media blackout.
[02:33:35.633 --> 02:33:41.237]  By June of 2008, we had already figured out that Barack Obama was the elite's puppet of choice.
[02:33:41.677 --> 02:33:50.884]  The national media claimed that during the weekend the Bilderberg group was scheduled to meet, that Obama had speaking engagements set for Chicago and the Midwest.
[02:33:51.304 --> 02:33:51.945]  We knew better.
[02:33:52.785 --> 02:34:02.669]  In a classic bait-and-switch, the Obama campaign told the press corps to get on Obama's campaign plane and that Obama would join them on the flight to Chicago.
[02:34:03.049 --> 02:34:05.890]  Campaign staff then slammed the door shut.
[02:34:06.310 --> 02:34:12.373]  The fawning press had been shanghaied as Obama's campaign aircraft lifted off without Obama.
[02:34:13.340 --> 02:34:23.725]  Robert, why were we not told about this meeting and that the Senator wouldn't be on our plate until the doors were shut and we were about to taxi to take off?
[02:34:23.865 --> 02:34:29.947]  Again, we had a desire, Senator Obama had a desire to do some meetings.
[02:34:30.007 --> 02:34:35.150]  Others had a desire to meet with him tonight in a private way and that's what we're doing.
[02:34:35.170 --> 02:34:38.411]  We set up these meetings, they're being done tonight.
[02:34:42.659 --> 02:34:48.443]  I'm not going to get into all the details of the meetings.
[02:34:48.463 --> 02:34:54.347]  I don't know that I've got a ton more different answers for all of your questions.
[02:35:00.555 --> 02:35:04.259]  Initially, it was believed that the secret meeting took place at Clinton's Washington, D.C.
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:04.560]  home.
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:08.925]  Obama's spokesman denied that, but won't confirm where the former rivals met.
[02:35:09.365 --> 02:35:12.029]  He also declined to comment on their topics of discussion.
[02:35:13.052 --> 02:35:19.978]  For a day and a half, the mainstream media engaged in a wild goose chase, trying to find out where Hillary and Obama had gone.
[02:35:20.358 --> 02:35:27.384]  Three cover stories later, the corporate press had to admit they had no idea where the two candidates had gone.
[02:35:27.904 --> 02:35:31.387]  And to this day, Clinton and Obama aren't talking.
[02:35:32.025 --> 02:35:40.533]  Plenty of sources knew about this meeting, told us and others that it was at Hillary Clinton's house, but clearly it wasn't.
[02:35:40.553 --> 02:35:45.877]  In 2008, the trail led us to the Westfields Marriott Hotel, right outside Washington, D.C.
[02:35:48.644 --> 02:35:50.285]  We just flew into Washington, D.C.
[02:35:51.065 --> 02:35:52.986]  We're driving to the Westfields Marriott.
[02:35:53.146 --> 02:35:57.668]  Tomorrow the hotel's closed throughout the week and in the weekend for the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[02:35:58.228 --> 02:35:59.728]  We're going to check in the night before.
[02:35:59.768 --> 02:36:00.989]  They're going to kick us out tomorrow.
[02:36:01.509 --> 02:36:03.730]  So we're going directly into the belly of the beast.
[02:36:04.170 --> 02:36:07.872]  The hotel will be filled with at least five spy agencies.
[02:36:08.172 --> 02:36:13.274]  CIA, Defense Intelligence, Facade, European Union Security.
[02:36:14.409 --> 02:36:22.016]  We checked into the Westfields Marriott 48 hours before hotel guests were scheduled to be thrown out ahead of the annual meeting.
[02:36:23.677 --> 02:36:32.285]  The building was nestled in the heart of the military-industrial complex, with the National Reconnaissance Office and Raytheon just a stone's throw away.
[02:36:43.868 --> 02:36:55.414]  The plan tonight is to try to not get arrested, dodge the security, get in there, get some footage of the elite arriving in the morning, because some arrive before they officially lock it down, and then getting out of the building.
[02:36:55.474 --> 02:36:55.934]  That's our plan.
[02:36:55.954 --> 02:37:07.760]  I'm also going to be getting a call by an international syndicated radio show, Coast to Coast AM with George Norrie, and all week he's getting briefings from me every night about things as they develop.
[02:37:15.569 --> 02:37:18.450]  George, we're sitting here in the room.
[02:37:18.990 --> 02:37:23.870]  As the phone rings, with your producer Tom Dannenhauser to put me on, the fire alarm goes off.
[02:37:24.691 --> 02:37:26.651]  So everybody is exiting the building.
[02:37:26.811 --> 02:37:27.891]  I know this is a setup.
[02:37:27.951 --> 02:37:29.811]  They timed it exactly when this happened.
[02:37:30.232 --> 02:37:30.672]  Open the door.
[02:37:30.692 --> 02:37:31.772]  I want to hear the fire alarm.
[02:37:32.152 --> 02:37:32.652]  Open the door.
[02:37:33.072 --> 02:37:34.852]  I want people to hear this live.
[02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:37.693]  Sixteen million people listening.
[02:37:43.254 --> 02:37:43.934]  George, do you hear that?
[02:37:45.185 --> 02:37:47.267]  Now, now, now, they're going to use this as an excuse.
[02:37:47.307 --> 02:37:50.229]  The Westfields Marriott, right outside D.C.
[02:37:50.269 --> 02:37:52.972]  in Chantilly, they want to use this to flush us out of here.
[02:37:53.012 --> 02:37:53.932]  They're very upset.
[02:37:54.032 --> 02:37:57.655]  Everybody that covers Bilderberg, I was detained two years ago, interrogated, screamed at.
[02:37:57.936 --> 02:38:00.798]  They said Bilderberg was upset about me, wanted to stop us.
[02:38:02.139 --> 02:38:03.060]  This is guaranteed.
[02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:05.062]  Everywhere we go, we're followed.
[02:38:05.162 --> 02:38:07.644]  We have another hotel across town as a base of operations.
[02:38:07.664 --> 02:38:10.566]  They were there questioning us, getting in our faces.
[02:38:10.947 --> 02:38:11.747]  We're being followed everywhere.
[02:38:11.787 --> 02:38:12.528]  I need everybody's support.
[02:38:12.568 --> 02:38:13.108]  We're good to go.
[02:38:35.587 --> 02:38:37.269]  This is just absolutely insane.
[02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:44.939]  I noticed too that there was over 100 security people here today, but tonight we got back and it was a total ghost town and this is what's insane.
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:51.668]  We have a security guy walk up to us 30 minutes ago, about 25 minutes ago, before this happened and said, what are you guys doing?
[02:38:51.688 --> 02:38:53.671]  We said, we're just walking around checking out the artwork in the hotel.
[02:38:54.211 --> 02:38:56.793]  Which we actually were admiring, and we were also going around getting some footage.
[02:38:57.473 --> 02:38:58.874]  And they said, well, no cameras allowed.
[02:38:58.894 --> 02:38:59.474]  We said, fine.
[02:38:59.494 --> 02:39:03.777]  And then he said, yeah, we had somebody do a fire alarm a few weeks ago.
[02:39:03.857 --> 02:39:05.538]  And me and Rob, my camera got ruined.
[02:39:05.558 --> 02:39:07.079]  Why is he telling us about a fire alarm?
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:08.800]  I forgot that part, George.
[02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:09.961]  These bastards have done this.
[02:39:10.001 --> 02:39:10.721]  I don't know how.
[02:39:10.922 --> 02:39:12.883]  They're planning to try to set us up for something.
[02:39:13.123 --> 02:39:14.084]  But this is incredible.
[02:39:14.104 --> 02:39:16.025]  We are here in the middle of this right now, George.
[02:39:47.116 --> 02:39:47.537]  Stay there.
[02:39:47.557 --> 02:39:48.317]  Keep him locked.
[02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:56.987]  Let's go.
[02:39:57.067 --> 02:39:59.709]  Let's get out of here now, Richard.
[02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:01.051]  Don't turn around anymore.
[02:40:02.112 --> 02:40:03.974]  We got out of here on exactly the right time.
[02:40:03.994 --> 02:40:04.655]  Is this the way out?
[02:40:05.596 --> 02:40:05.756]  Yeah.
[02:40:20.655 --> 02:40:21.776]  Yeah, we got a car right behind us.
[02:40:23.516 --> 02:40:34.321]  He made about, what, five turns into six turns, the same car's following us.
[02:40:35.082 --> 02:40:39.444]  Now he looks like he's following us into a... He came out of Bilderberg, he came out of the Westfield.
[02:40:39.464 --> 02:40:43.166]  He's being a little bit subtle, but... Not too.
[02:40:43.226 --> 02:40:43.666]  There he is.
[02:40:44.006 --> 02:40:45.327]  That's him over there in the blue car.
[02:41:04.468 --> 02:41:06.709]  We're headed back to the Marriott here in Chantilly, Virginia.
[02:41:06.789 --> 02:41:08.689]  The scene of Bilderberg 2008.
[02:41:09.550 --> 02:41:11.950]  We've successfully infiltrated the last day and a half inside.
[02:41:12.010 --> 02:41:13.151]  Got out with some great stuff.
[02:41:13.491 --> 02:41:14.211]  We've been tailed.
[02:41:15.011 --> 02:41:21.353]  And now we're going back to cover the dignitaries, the elitist, as they arrive.
[02:41:21.393 --> 02:41:24.014]  And right now is the prime time for them to start arriving in the next 3-4 hours.
[02:41:24.574 --> 02:41:25.655]  We took about a 30 minute break.
[02:41:25.675 --> 02:41:26.975]  I'm sure we missed a few, but it doesn't matter.
[02:41:27.635 --> 02:41:30.476]  We've got scores of people that just organically are listeners.
[02:41:30.916 --> 02:41:32.477]  Info warriors that are out here taking action.
[02:41:39.017 --> 02:41:56.825]  And we're going to be out here for the next three days while you try to chart the future of our destiny.
[02:41:57.165 --> 02:41:59.006]  We're taking our destiny back!
[02:41:59.326 --> 02:42:01.987]  You're not our gods or our masters!
[02:42:04.093 --> 02:42:17.599]  We witnessed at least seven convoys of armed secret service entering the Westfields Marriott, and internal sources confirmed that both candidates did attend at least one meeting inside the conference.
[02:42:19.940 --> 02:42:31.306]  While the Bilderberg Group was 100% successful in 2008 at keeping their name out of the mainstream media, they did not fare as well when it came to the exploding independent press.
[02:42:33.174 --> 02:42:40.036]  During the entire two-day event, anti-New World Order protesters and alternative media encircled the hotel.
[02:42:41.797 --> 02:42:44.058]  You're being exposed everywhere!
[02:42:44.318 --> 02:42:48.399]  From David Rockefeller, from John Edwards, from Bill Clinton!
[02:42:48.679 --> 02:42:50.220]  Your game of secrecy is over!
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:51.200]  You're gonna pay!
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:51.440]  Get him!
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:52.080]  Get him!
[02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:56.002]  It's a close-in piece of shit!
[02:42:56.042 --> 02:42:57.122]  You piece of crap!
[02:42:57.162 --> 02:42:58.422]  This is Bernanke, man!
[02:42:58.802 --> 02:43:00.143]  Bernanke, you're going down!
[02:43:06.937 --> 02:43:08.458]  We know you're here, Obama!
[02:43:08.498 --> 02:43:12.181]  You've cleared your schedule for the next few days!
[02:43:12.281 --> 02:43:14.022]  We know you're in Virginia!
[02:43:15.824 --> 02:43:16.384]  Arch-criminal!
[02:43:16.444 --> 02:43:17.225]  New World Order scum!
[02:43:17.485 --> 02:43:20.627]  We are not your slave, scum!
[02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:31.916]  Brave Americans came from all over the United States and bullhorned the main conference hall at close range as the global power brokers schemed inside.
[02:43:42.649 --> 02:43:46.591]  The global elite are desperate to keep their organizational meetings a secret.
[02:43:46.892 --> 02:43:55.436]  They are keenly aware that if the population discovers that policy is being developed covertly by powerful special interests, the people will revolt.
[02:43:55.936 --> 02:43:58.638]  It is our duty to expose these criminals.
[02:43:59.238 --> 02:44:07.122]  It's a criminal act under federal law for federal officials to have private meetings to discuss world policy.
[02:44:09.434 --> 02:44:12.095]  With non-federal workers.
[02:44:12.755 --> 02:44:31.821]  So everybody from the State Department, Treasury Department, White House, Defense Department, and others who show up as they always do, they're committing a criminal act simply by being here to attend a secret meeting with officials from other countries to discuss U.S.
[02:44:31.841 --> 02:44:32.561]  policy in the world.
[02:44:33.999 --> 02:44:36.199]  So, literally, it's a criminal act.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:46.521]  And every newspaper, every broadcaster has a patriotic duty to expose these scum and the evil they project.
[02:44:47.261 --> 02:44:54.423]  The election primaries served as a great diversion while the true future course of the nation was being set behind closed doors.
[02:44:54.443 --> 02:45:01.884]  We've got, obviously, the Bilderberger Group, founded by the former Nazi Prince Bernard of Holland.
[02:45:02.702 --> 02:45:07.266]  You've got the Trilateral Commission, founded by David Rockefeller's Big New Brzezinski.
[02:45:07.326 --> 02:45:09.969]  They're the ones who ran the Carter administration.
[02:45:10.109 --> 02:45:17.076]  Everybody in the Carter administration, from Carter and Mondale and Volker and Brzezinski, were all members of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:45:17.556 --> 02:45:23.742]  Founding member of rap sensation Public Enemy, Professor Griff, gave us his view of the Obama phenomenon.
[02:45:23.922 --> 02:45:26.425]  Barack Obama's been given a pass by the blue bloods.
[02:45:27.206 --> 02:45:30.870]  He's been given the okay by certain secret societies for them to let him in.
[02:45:31.490 --> 02:45:36.096]  I truly believe imperialism and fascism needs a facelift.
[02:45:37.182 --> 02:45:39.703]  Uh, and the facelift is going to have to be black.
[02:45:40.424 --> 02:45:53.091]  And the reason why I believe that is simply because, um, I think they're trying to go into Africa, well they're already in Africa, but they want to totally control all the natural minerals that they're going to need to carry themselves into the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd centuries.
[02:45:55.672 --> 02:45:56.193]  Are you following me?
[02:45:56.253 --> 02:46:11.448]  So, I think they have to go through a phase of galvanizing the masses of dark-skinned people that truly believe that change needs to come, but the change that they're talking about is not necessarily change for the better as far as the masses of the people.
[02:46:12.028 --> 02:46:14.391]  It's probably a better change for them.
[02:46:14.591 --> 02:46:17.434]  It's not going to change for us, the little man on a totem pole.
[02:46:17.814 --> 02:46:19.034]  And no one looks at the agenda.
[02:46:19.134 --> 02:46:33.619]  As long as he positions himself right, has the right tie on, has the right smile, repeats the slogans over and over and drives it home, the average American is just going to swallow it hook, line, and sinker.
[02:46:33.799 --> 02:46:35.160]  And we don't even know what the agenda is.
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:41.182]  Writing in his 1964 book with no apologies, Senator Barry Goldwater said,
[02:46:42.543 --> 02:46:52.747]  The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[02:46:53.247 --> 02:47:04.511]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[02:47:05.311 --> 02:47:15.042]  What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation-states involved.
[02:47:15.062 --> 02:47:18.866]  As managers and creators of the system, they will rule the future.
[02:47:20.259 --> 02:47:26.424]  Bilderberg issues executive decisions and prime directives to its sub-directorates for implementation.
[02:47:26.684 --> 02:47:34.730]  The Trilateral Commission takes the Bilderberg Group agenda and executes it through regional roundtable groups throughout Europe, Asia and the Americas.
[02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:40.394]  The Council on Foreign Relations serves as the managing roundtable group in the United States sector.
[02:47:40.974 --> 02:47:46.418]  The Council on Foreign Relations has dominated every administration since the days of FDR.
[02:47:48.427 --> 02:47:55.374]  The way in which they make policy and rule is that they are a polycentric oligarchical system.
[02:47:56.155 --> 02:47:57.756]  You have to be a finance oligarch.
[02:47:57.996 --> 02:48:06.565]  Remember, this is not a society ruled by generals, not by priests, not by bureaucrats, not by demagogues, none of those, but by bankers.
[02:48:06.925 --> 02:48:07.686]  Bankers rule.
[02:48:08.366 --> 02:48:10.547]  And the bankers set up these institutions.
[02:48:10.707 --> 02:48:31.371]  They set up things modeled on the Royal Institute for International Affairs, Chatham House, and the Milner Roundtable of the period right after the Boer War, so even before World War I. You had the British setting up these roundtables, institutes, with publications and conferences, and this is how they make policy.
[02:48:32.486 --> 02:48:49.053]  Upon Obama's inauguration, members of the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, and CFR flooded into every position of power in the executive branch, replacing Trilateral Commission and CFR members who previously filled the positions during the Bush administration.
[02:48:51.254 --> 02:48:53.035]  When you look at the U.S.
[02:48:53.135 --> 02:48:58.578]  ruling class, you'd have to say that they're a really pathetic bunch of failures and bunglers.
[02:48:58.638 --> 02:49:01.739]  They are a miserable excuse for a ruling class.
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:07.362]  And that's one of the big problems we have, is you go from Clinton to Bush to Obama.
[02:49:07.803 --> 02:49:12.405]  What stays the same is the ruling elite that gives these puppets the orders that they act on.
[02:49:12.825 --> 02:49:13.886]  And these orders are
[02:49:14.366 --> 02:49:16.510]  Wrong headed, let's say, to say the least.
[02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:17.932]  They're basically bankrupt.
[02:49:17.952 --> 02:49:20.616]  They're going to lead to the collapse of this civilization.
[02:49:20.936 --> 02:49:29.349]  What they're doing is using the existence of the United States as a formerly powerful nation state to act out their
[02:49:29.970 --> 02:49:37.532]  Wall Street fantasies of world domination and maintaining their capital structures and maintaining their system of looting and this can't be done.
[02:49:37.952 --> 02:49:41.933]  So the basic question is they've hijacked our country and you got to take it back from them.
[02:49:42.233 --> 02:49:50.815]  You've got to drive Wall Street out of the government and at that point you'd have a reasonable chance of getting back to prosperity and some kind of peace and order in international affairs.
[02:49:51.055 --> 02:49:54.276]  We had a chance to speak with economist and author George Humphrey.
[02:49:54.836 --> 02:49:57.598]  They have created a power elite.
[02:49:57.619 --> 02:50:01.742]  We're not talking about the millionaire down the street.
[02:50:01.822 --> 02:50:07.006]  You can't even be a member of their club unless you're a multi-billionaire.
[02:50:07.927 --> 02:50:11.730]  And friends, this is not about rich versus poor.
[02:50:12.331 --> 02:50:20.357]  This is about a very, very small handful of the worst criminal element on this planet.
[02:50:21.502 --> 02:50:27.367]  Manipulating and destroying the good people of this nation and of this world.
[02:50:27.587 --> 02:50:29.408]  About this Obama with change.
[02:50:29.829 --> 02:50:36.614]  Look at the people he's put in to mastermind the economic recovery.
[02:50:37.515 --> 02:50:38.676]  Larry Summers.
[02:50:38.956 --> 02:50:39.337]  I love it.
[02:50:39.797 --> 02:50:44.381]  Every time they talk about Larry Summers, he's always brilliant.
[02:51:00.706 --> 02:51:02.248]  No one likes foreclosure.
[02:51:02.528 --> 02:51:07.212]  You won't say, think, or even consider foreclosure with ZerodetGuarantee.com.
[02:51:07.432 --> 02:51:07.713]  Why?
[02:51:07.913 --> 02:51:16.221]  Because ZerodetGuarantee.com guarantees to stop your foreclosure for at least two years with no payments, no bankruptcy, and no negotiating.
[02:51:16.401 --> 02:51:17.602]  Thinking loan modification?
[02:51:17.842 --> 02:51:19.284]  That still keeps you in default.
[02:51:19.524 --> 02:51:21.746]  Zerodet in 90 days is the only proven
[02:51:21.786 --> 02:51:22.306]  We're good to go.
[02:51:47.014 --> 02:51:47.234]  Call 800-477-9256.
[02:51:47.254 --> 02:51:47.294]  800-477-9256.
[02:51:47.314 --> 02:51:47.495]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:51:47.555 --> 02:51:48.576]  Or visit ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[02:51:48.596 --> 02:51:49.477]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[02:52:00.490 --> 02:52:02.792]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:02.872 --> 02:52:05.053]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.073 --> 02:52:07.955]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.395 --> 02:52:13.138]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.498 --> 02:52:17.701]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.001 --> 02:52:20.345]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.365 --> 02:52:22.889]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:22.909 --> 02:52:25.813]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.153 --> 02:52:33.765]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.079 --> 02:52:39.361]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.481 --> 02:52:41.742]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.322 --> 02:52:45.764]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.004 --> 02:52:46.944]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.084 --> 02:52:48.405]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.425 --> 02:52:49.425]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:00.598 --> 02:53:03.782]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[02:53:04.362 --> 02:53:04.923]  Think again.
[02:53:05.704 --> 02:53:13.173]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[02:53:13.333 --> 02:53:20.261]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[02:53:20.561 --> 02:53:28.743]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.
[02:53:29.123 --> 02:53:30.043]  Do what NOAA did.

[02:54:08.365 --> 02:54:08.745]  I love it.
[02:54:09.165 --> 02:54:13.768]  Every time they talk about Larry Summers, he's always brilliant.
[02:54:13.948 --> 02:54:15.688]  He's another brilliant one.
[02:54:16.209 --> 02:54:25.893]  He's the one that helped dismantle the Glass-Steagall Act, the banking act that was put in place in the 1930s, so the banks couldn't get become the banksters that they become.
[02:54:26.113 --> 02:54:26.313]  In the 1990s,
[02:54:27.674 --> 02:54:37.585]  You had the beginning of the derivatives bubble, thanks to people like Alan Greenspan, Reuben Summers, a lot of the people who are now back in the Obama administration.
[02:54:38.106 --> 02:54:42.070]  And the derivatives, I think, are the centerpiece of this entire problem today.
[02:54:42.451 --> 02:54:43.832]  These are the same people
[02:54:44.813 --> 02:54:47.054]  Geithner from the Treasury Department.
[02:54:47.074 --> 02:54:48.095]  Could you imagine that?
[02:54:49.316 --> 02:54:50.416]  Now we have the U.S.
[02:54:50.536 --> 02:55:05.926]  Treasury Secretary, who also is a Robert Rubin protege of the Larry Summers Group, that dismantled Glass-Steagall and broke apart the regulations that would have prohibited the banks and the brokerages from becoming these criminals.
[02:55:06.906 --> 02:55:14.621]  He was the former president of the New York Federal Reserve, and now he's our Treasury Secretary?
[02:55:14.641 --> 02:55:16.625]  And as we all know,
[02:55:17.711 --> 02:55:20.812]  The Federal Reserve is as federal as Federal Express.
[02:55:21.072 --> 02:55:22.053]  It's a private bank.
[02:55:22.533 --> 02:55:24.774]  And now we've put this guy in charge of it?
[02:55:25.654 --> 02:55:29.556]  I mean, Wall Street has hijacked Washington in broad daylight.
[02:55:30.296 --> 02:55:33.657]  Every single one of his appointments support the status quo.
[02:55:34.458 --> 02:55:39.460]  Every one of his appointments are there to screw the American people.
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:47.103]  Every single one of his appointments are people who are working to bring down the Republic and the Constitution of this country.
[02:55:48.268 --> 02:55:53.410]  Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, Bilderberg Group and Trilateral Commission member.
[02:55:54.631 --> 02:55:58.873]  Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, is a Bilderberg and CFR member.
[02:55:59.073 --> 02:56:03.075]  She is also married to Trilateral Commission member, William Jefferson Clinton.
[02:56:03.975 --> 02:56:08.357]  Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, Trilateral Commission.
[02:56:09.558 --> 02:56:15.701]  National Security Advisor, General James L. Jones, Bilderberg, Trilateral Commission and CFR.
[02:56:17.884 --> 02:56:23.009]  Deputy National Security Advisor Thomas Donelan, Trilateral Commission, CFR.
[02:56:25.472 --> 02:56:31.938]  Special State Department Envoy Henry Kissinger, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, and CFR.
[02:56:32.839 --> 02:56:39.927]  Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee, Paul Volcker, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:56:41.363 --> 02:56:48.465]  The Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Dennis C. Blair, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, CFR.
[02:56:50.346 --> 02:56:56.028]  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, CFR.
[02:56:57.068 --> 02:57:03.931]  Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, CFR.
[02:57:05.689 --> 02:57:13.391]  State Department Special Envoy Richard Haass, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, and President of the CFR.
[02:57:14.431 --> 02:57:21.173]  Obama Presidential Advisor Alan Greenspan, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, CFR.
[02:57:22.433 --> 02:57:28.795]  State Department Special Envoy Richard C. Holbrook, Bilderberg, Trilateral, CFR.
[02:57:29.335 --> 02:57:31.676]  And the list goes on and on.
[02:57:36.798 --> 02:57:46.886]  Even if Barack Obama were the most wonderful person in the world, he was groomed and brought to power by the global elite to carry out their agenda.
[02:57:47.287 --> 02:57:57.995]  Humanity must look past Obama and realize that presidents come and go, but the shadow government and their program of global enslavement continues.
[02:57:59.336 --> 02:58:05.021]  How could people be so stupid and gullible to believe a bunch of political people?
[02:58:08.211 --> 02:58:12.595]  So people who voted for Obama were trying to express, I think, first of all, something worthwhile.
[02:58:12.735 --> 02:58:22.063]  The hatred for Bush, Cheney, the neocons, the desire to punish the Republicans for their adventures, their police state, and their economic depression.
[02:58:22.744 --> 02:58:24.645]  The second question was on the economy.
[02:58:25.046 --> 02:58:29.089]  People felt that Bush was selling them down the river into a world depression.
[02:58:29.189 --> 02:58:30.951]  He is, of course, the new Herbert Hoover.
[02:58:33.223 --> 02:58:36.487]  You've been listening to excerpts from the documentary film, The Obama Deception.
