[00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:06.111]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:07.892]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.892 --> 00:00:09.653]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:11.233]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.976]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:21.037]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:41.795]  We've got Mark Anderson and Jim Tucker joining us for part of the next hour from Bilderberg 2010 on this third day.
[00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:55.373]  Ladies and gentlemen, this Thursday edition, June 3rd, 2010, and then Viktor Ostrovsky will be joining us.
[00:00:55.373 --> 00:01:00.715]  He was an Israeli captain in the Navy and then a member of the Mossad.
[00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:09.617]  He wrote the best-selling book, By Way of Deception, critical of a corruption and deception within the Mossad and within the Israeli government.
[00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:22.890]  He will be joining us, he was in the Washington Post yesterday, very critical of the Israeli boarding of the six ships in the Mediterranean on multiple fronts.
[00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.951]  He will be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:38.954]  And we're also working on some other guest, on some stories we're working on popping in, in the last hour of transmission today.
[00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:52.571]  Yesterday I reported that they are moving in Michigan to have a government board that certifies anyone to be able to have a blog or website that purports to be reporting news or analysis.
[00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:54.392]  The end of the First Amendment.
[00:01:54.392 --> 00:02:03.337]  We have no fewer than 14 of Obama's top appointees or czars calling for an open end of free speech in America, including jail time.
[00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:18.369]  For free speech we have police all over the country from Texas to Florida from New York, California every day in the news Of course I just saw a report last week out of Maryland
[00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:27.450]  Where they are arresting people who videotape police from even 200 yards away as they beat citizens.
[00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.533]  And then they're charging them with wiretapping, though the law doesn't even say that.
[00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:34.795]  You're in a public place, you don't have any perception of privacy.
[00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:43.060]  Whether you're police, or a bluebird, or a weasel, or a turkey, or a dog walking down the street.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.421]  Or a milkman, for that matter.
[00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:47.763]  And the police know that.
[00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:49.886]  It's just part of this predatory system.
[00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:53.229]  And make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, we have a predatory government.
[00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.911]  Do we have individual good people in government?
[00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:55.972]  Individual good cops?
[00:02:55.972 --> 00:02:56.652]  Yes.
[00:02:56.652 --> 00:03:04.460]  But the system is a rotten, lying, stealing, evil, corrupt pack of trash.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.523]  And a danger, a hazard to us all.
[00:03:07.864 --> 00:03:10.545]  So you have all these attacks on free speech going on.
[00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.326]  All of this going on.
[00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:13.566]  Liberal coalition.
[00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:14.487]  That's an oxymoron.
[00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:15.267]  They're liberals.
[00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:20.009]  It's like that senator in Michigan wanting to ban free speech.
[00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.690]  And he has a group called the Free Press promoting it.
[00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.052]  And he's a constitutional lawyer.
[00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:28.952]  Yes.
[00:03:28.952 --> 00:03:30.633]  Oh, well, he's a constitutional lawyer.
[00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:32.094]  He says there's no First Amendment.
[00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:34.975]  Well, he must know he's a constitutional lawyer.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.544]  Liberal coalition demands FCC move to shut down talk radio.
[00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:45.325]  And they are moving ahead with that.
[00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.206]  A new article out on that today.
[00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.808]  We covered some of this yesterday, but new developments today.
[00:03:49.808 --> 00:03:53.450]  Of course, the FCC is simultaneously agreeing with them.
[00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.031]  Yes.
[00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.371]  Yes.
[00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:58.773]  They're not going to just look at cuss words now.
[00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:12.243]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they want to shut down all of the free speech.
[00:04:12.243 --> 00:04:22.806]  And separately, all over the country, we have charges against people in areas like Chicago and New York where there's total victim disarmament.
[00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:26.867]  And you'll have pillars of the community in a Chicago case being attacked.
[00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.988]  And so they have a hidden gun and defend themselves.
[00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:31.789]  And the mob boss, Daley, says, look, I'm a gangster.
[00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:38.282]  The last thing I want is my fellow criminals being resisted.
[00:04:38.282 --> 00:04:43.323]  And so I'm going to charge this 80 plus year old person with defending themselves.
[00:04:43.323 --> 00:04:45.004]  You don't do that!
[00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:45.864]  You exist!
[00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:48.604]  The non-criminal exists for one thing.
[00:04:48.604 --> 00:04:56.326]  As a stake on the plate to every form of criminal in the criminal brotherhood known as government and their allied servants.
[00:04:57.421 --> 00:04:58.842]  What did our founding fathers tell us?
[00:04:58.842 --> 00:04:59.822]  They told us government was criminal.
[00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:04.764]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:05:04.764 --> 00:05:05.744]  What have we got?
[00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:08.205]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:09.206]  A republic.
[00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:11.767]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:14.128]  It's not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:16.148]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:17.809]  So they think they own our land?
[00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.149]  They think they own our water?
[00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.750]  Children?
[00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.870]  Our education?
[00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.690]  Our money?
[00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.352]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:30.699]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:31.720]  We have the facts.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.881]  We have the Constitution.
[00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:33.783]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:34.684]  We have common law.
[00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:37.187]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:37.187 --> 00:05:40.972]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:05:41.072 --> 00:05:46.036]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:05:46.036 --> 00:05:47.537]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:05:47.537 --> 00:05:48.617]  Don't tread on me.
[00:05:48.617 --> 00:05:55.482]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.240]  And you're subject to public police action.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.501]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.501 --> 00:06:09.243]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:11.685]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:17.549]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:23.773]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.213 --> 00:06:30.155]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:34.356]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:38.657]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:44.599]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.140]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.121]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:50.581]  It's here.

[00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:03.868]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:07:03.868 --> 00:07:12.052]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:07:12.052 --> 00:07:17.354]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:20.356]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:24.258]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[00:07:24.258 --> 00:07:27.459]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.081]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:34.664]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:07:34.664 --> 00:07:40.468]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:07:40.468 --> 00:07:44.110]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.932]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:46.932 --> 00:07:51.875]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:52.156]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:52.156 --> 00:07:53.537]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:01.743 --> 00:08:08.388]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:18.997]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:20.379]  Alright, here is what I'm going to do.
[00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:25.963]  I'm going to blitz through news right now on this June 3rd, Thursday edition.
[00:08:27.418 --> 00:08:45.631]  Then I'm going to open the phones up for your breakdown on what's happening with the world economy, the Israeli flotilla debacle of four days ago, the escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, on the news coming out of the Bilderberg Group meeting that kicks off today.
[00:08:46.531 --> 00:08:48.853]  On any issue you wish to discuss, 800-259-9231.
[00:08:48.853 --> 00:08:48.913]  800-259-9231.
[00:08:48.913 --> 00:08:52.437]  Mark Anderson and Jim Tucker of American Free Press from Bilderberg in
[00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:04.467]  Spain will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:04.467 --> 00:09:22.095]  Viktor Ostrovsky, former Israeli naval commander, captain, and of course Mossad commander, also the head of the Israeli Naval Weapons Laboratory, a very senior former member of the Israeli system, will be joining us.
[00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:22.796]  He's critical
[00:09:23.616 --> 00:09:28.119]  Of what Israel did with the raid on multiple levels.
[00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:35.924]  So he'll be giving us his perspective on that coming up in the third hour today.
[00:09:35.924 --> 00:09:39.967]  We do have Nigel Farage joining us tomorrow.
[00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:42.489]  He hasn't done really any interviews.
[00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:43.690]  He got hurt pretty bad, folks.
[00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.531]  He's had a lot of surgeries.
[00:09:45.531 --> 00:09:47.192]  Member of the European Union Parliament.
[00:09:50.037 --> 00:09:50.197]  I think?
[00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:19.506]  And so if all goes well, he'll be popping in with us tomorrow to separately talk about just the state of the European Union and the meltdown in Spain, Portugal, and of course Greece, and what's happening there.
[00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:23.908]  So we really appreciate him having the strength to come on the broadcast yesterday.
[00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:30.892]  He barely survived, and of course the pilot was even in worse condition.
[00:10:30.892 --> 00:10:33.814]  But he's a tough guy, and he is kicking.
[00:10:33.814 --> 00:10:35.195]  He is alive and kicking.
[00:10:36.397 --> 00:10:38.303]  So that's coming up tomorrow.
[00:10:38.303 --> 00:10:41.212]  And we have other reporters who are at Bilderberg Road.
[00:10:42.807 --> 00:10:45.928]  popping in tomorrow as well.
[00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:59.293]  So we'll continue to cover Bilderberg Group 2010 and we've got Dr. John Coleman coming on discussing the overall black nobility above Bilderberg or the overall hereditary power structure with a committee of 300.
[00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:06.736]  He's joining us on the 14th, about a week and a half from now, with a part two of our interview we did yesterday.
[00:11:09.366 --> 00:11:23.724]  Before I continue with the breakdown of all the world news that I think's important, and then go to your calls to get your take on what you think's important, I want to just declare here at the start of the broadcast, we're 11 minutes into transmission today,
[00:11:24.676 --> 00:11:31.238]  That we have powerful tools in our hands to defeat this illegitimate criminal New World Order.
[00:11:31.238 --> 00:11:45.262]  Because they are illegitimate, they are criminal, they are engaging in the overthrow of sovereign governments, they are replacing our constitutions in every case with draconian, authoritarian, abusive, despotic systems.
[00:11:45.262 --> 00:11:51.344]  And so if we simply expose them, and oppose them, and speak out against them, they will fall!
[00:11:53.956 --> 00:11:56.358]  They are illegitimate!
[00:11:56.358 --> 00:12:00.540]  And I know a lot of us have New World Order fatigue.
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.261]  I do myself.
[00:12:01.261 --> 00:12:06.444]  I mean, I see articles about public schools brainwashing kids to take implantable microchips.
[00:12:06.444 --> 00:12:08.525]  Ten years ago, I'd yell and scream about it.
[00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:09.406]  I'm desensitized.
[00:12:09.406 --> 00:12:10.787]  I hardly cover it.
[00:12:10.787 --> 00:12:15.810]  Or I see new articles about two major vaccines on the market filled with cancer viruses.
[00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.532]  Another filled with a pig virus that is known to kill humans.
[00:12:19.252 --> 00:12:21.533]  And the government's saying it's healthy, take your shot.
[00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.454]  That's mainstream news.
[00:12:23.454 --> 00:12:27.455]  Five years ago, they would withdraw a vaccine.
[00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:30.276]  Now they just say, yeah, it may kill you, take it.
[00:12:30.276 --> 00:12:34.958]  So they know that we're all becoming just conditioned to accept the incredible.
[00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.479]  Yeah, we're getting ready to take your pension funds publicly.
[00:12:37.479 --> 00:12:38.599]  That is, the government is.
[00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:42.140]  Yeah, but a lot of companies are either cutting your pension funds or outright stealing them.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.741]  Big deal, take it.
[00:12:43.741 --> 00:12:46.662]  Yeah, there's more homeless people everywhere, crawling all over the place.
[00:12:47.402 --> 00:12:48.542]  Society's collapsing.
[00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:50.663]  Stores are shutting down everywhere.
[00:12:50.663 --> 00:12:50.923]  U.S.
[00:12:50.923 --> 00:12:54.203]  factory jobs record low last month.
[00:12:54.203 --> 00:12:56.484]  Record production loss.
[00:12:56.484 --> 00:13:00.345]  New taxes at every level actually causing the economy to stall further.
[00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:02.225]  That's the plan.
[00:13:02.225 --> 00:13:04.805]  We're just careening headlong into tyranny.
[00:13:04.805 --> 00:13:08.926]  I've got three articles a day about foreign troops and police training in the U.S.
[00:13:08.926 --> 00:13:09.766]  to take on U.S.
[00:13:09.766 --> 00:13:13.267]  citizens from Germany, from England, from Canada.
[00:13:15.282 --> 00:13:18.064]  Open announcements everywhere to restrict our free speech.
[00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:20.786]  It is happening.
[00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:22.527]  It is happening.
[00:13:22.527 --> 00:13:28.552]  See, they've dispensed with the denials of tyranny while they were building the infrastructure and they're moving ahead now.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:14:02.088]  I mean, we need to pause here and have a reflective moment to think about what our society is turning into.
[00:14:02.088 --> 00:14:06.890]  We have to basically deal with the magnitude
[00:14:10.077 --> 00:14:10.617]  I think?
[00:14:25.675 --> 00:14:37.261]  Is over and all of the horrible fruits of degradation and enslavement and domination will now be what we will enjoy and what our children will suffer under now.
[00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:38.761]  I mean, it's now here.
[00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:43.864]  It's now we've gone over the cliff in history in societies.
[00:14:43.864 --> 00:14:49.066]  Once you reach a certain point of corruption.
[00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:50.187]  It's like a flashpoint.
[00:14:50.187 --> 00:14:50.487]  You can
[00:14:53.942 --> 00:15:10.036]  You can put a piece of paper on top of a glass top stove that has the metal coils beneath the glass, and you can lay that paper on top of it and turn it up on high.
[00:15:10.036 --> 00:15:22.146]  And in about a minute, you'll see it start, the white paper to start to yellow, start to crack, start to brown, then it will turn black, and the entire piece of paper will suddenly burst into flame.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:33.485]  And the paper has yellowed, it has browned, it has cracked, and it is now bursting in flame.
[00:15:33.485 --> 00:15:42.310]  And the next two years, which is just a twinkle of the eye in human history, is that one second that it's being consumed in the flame.
[00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:52.315]  But if you could watch it in slow motion right now, the center of the paper has now flashed white in an ignition of flame.
[00:15:52.315 --> 00:15:53.016]  An explosion.
[00:15:54.172 --> 00:16:00.617]  You know, at flour factories, until they put in safety precautions in the last 50 years, you would have explosions.
[00:16:00.617 --> 00:16:16.709]  You know, flour can explode like black powder, because of all the hundreds of millions of little flour particles, and they're dry, and when they light, almost like a gas, almost like butane or propane, it can explode.
[00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:22.094]  And it's the same thing, it's like a flour factory going up sky high.
[00:16:23.611 --> 00:16:30.817]  Exploding like a thousand pounds of TNT have been detonated.
[00:16:30.817 --> 00:16:32.439]  That's what's going on right now.
[00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:49.853]  And the globalists understand that during this flux period, during this explosion period, they've got to go into the levers, make all their changes, and use the crisis to get societies and governments and civilizations in a dizzying whirlwind to just accept what happens.
[00:16:54.562 --> 00:17:15.476]  It is our job right now to put out the maximum effort we can, whether it's talking to your neighbor or having a local newsletter you put out, or going up to green sheets that are at the gas station or at the mall or at the restaurant, the diner, and sitting there for 20 minutes and sticking one sheet
[00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:21.980]  Info flyers, you know, they have key websites and key terms in it, inside of it.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:27.163]  Or sending, you know, out to your friend's email list, key info.
[00:17:27.163 --> 00:17:30.765]  Or producing your own, you know, quick YouTube videos every day.
[00:17:30.765 --> 00:17:35.347]  Or airing my films on AXS TV or having viewing parties.
[00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.869]  The awakening is now!
[00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:39.570]  And I cannot state enough that
[00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.091]  I have sampled the entire spectrum of information out there.
[00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:55.555]  There's a lot of great freedom information, truth information, anti-enslavement info out there, but the best info, bar none, is my films.
[00:17:55.555 --> 00:18:06.939]  Whether it's The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Invisible Empire, Police State 4, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, these are essential films!
[00:18:08.154 --> 00:18:15.317]  There is so essential that you go to InfoWars.com, that you get the DVDs, because they can shut the web down at any time.
[00:18:15.317 --> 00:18:17.518]  I've got news on that front today.
[00:18:17.518 --> 00:18:20.479]  They could stage a cyber attack tomorrow, or next year.
[00:18:21.971 --> 00:18:27.195]  When they kick off their World War III operation, and then, do you have the films in your stockpile?
[00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:28.476]  Do you have the DVD burners?
[00:18:28.476 --> 00:18:34.201]  Do you have the... We have to treat this like a war, because it is!
[00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:44.229]  And of all the films, I think the most important, right now, are probably Invisible Empire and Endgame, because they give you a general overview of what we're facing and what our enemy's game plan is.
[00:18:44.229 --> 00:18:48.413]  To understand the banking collapse and the current takeover, probably follow the Republic.
[00:18:49.054 --> 00:18:52.589]  I mean, have you made copies of the film that you have in your custody?
[00:18:53.618 --> 00:18:55.259]  Have you gotten it out to people?
[00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.080]  Look, you're not going to save the world by yourself.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.401]  It's not going to be a perfect, you know, one-size-fits-all.
[00:19:00.401 --> 00:19:03.602]  You're not going to die on a hill and defeat the New World Order.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:14.867]  It's going to be an incremental movement, an inexorable, unstoppable force of hundreds of millions of people doing little things every day in the butterfly or woodpecker effect.
[00:19:14.867 --> 00:19:18.769]  But together, we're going to bring this system down and the people are ready to be awakened today!

[00:19:55.034 --> 00:19:55.294]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:01.612]  Fact.
[00:20:01.612 --> 00:20:02.813]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:20:02.813 --> 00:20:04.934]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:04.934 --> 00:20:05.475]  Fact.
[00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:09.158]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.158 --> 00:20:09.779]  Fact.
[00:20:09.779 --> 00:20:15.283]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.283 --> 00:20:15.623]  Fact.
[00:20:15.623 --> 00:20:20.107]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.107 --> 00:20:20.688]  Fact.
[00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:24.391]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.
[00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:24.811]  We're good.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.503]  Don't wait to protect your liver.
[00:20:45.503 --> 00:20:47.165]  Visit us at ResearchedHerbs.com or call 1-800-973-1486.
[00:20:47.165 --> 00:20:48.347]  That's 1-800-973-1486 or go to ResearchedHerbs.com.
[00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:49.869]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[00:21:00.231 --> 00:21:10.260]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:16.706]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:21:16.706 --> 00:21:25.554]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:21:25.914 --> 00:21:35.099]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:21:35.099 --> 00:21:39.702]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[00:21:39.702 --> 00:21:41.503]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:41.503 --> 00:21:44.004]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:45.985]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.985 --> 00:21:51.808]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[00:21:51.808 --> 00:21:52.689]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.689 --> 00:21:53.049]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:02.470]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.870]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.071]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:08.071 --> 00:22:13.173]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.173 --> 00:22:17.374]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:17.694 --> 00:22:20.037]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:20.037 --> 00:22:22.581]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:22.581 --> 00:22:25.845]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:33.455]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:33.775 --> 00:22:39.178]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.178 --> 00:22:42.020]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.702]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:45.702 --> 00:22:46.783]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:48.124]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.124 --> 00:22:49.625]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.332]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:03.332 --> 00:23:07.104]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:12.256]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:14.338]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:23:14.338 --> 00:23:16.060]  Made me feel breathless.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.503]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:23:20.503 --> 00:23:21.584]  Nothing did anything.
[00:23:21.584 --> 00:23:25.568]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:23:25.568 --> 00:23:29.692]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:29.692 --> 00:23:32.314]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:23:32.768 --> 00:23:37.792]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month I completely vanished.
[00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:40.595]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[00:23:40.595 --> 00:23:45.379]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.562]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:24:02.406 --> 00:24:11.290]  Okay, let me just run through some of the headlines, then I'm going to go back through them in more detail coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:13.468 --> 00:24:13.808]  U.S.
[00:24:13.808 --> 00:24:18.611]  to join South Korean military exercise off of North Korean coast.
[00:24:18.611 --> 00:24:20.812]  ABC News, a major escalation.
[00:24:20.812 --> 00:24:27.815]  Pentagon sending USS George Washington to waters where North sunk South Korean vessel.
[00:24:27.815 --> 00:24:36.000]  Yeah, George Washington said don't get involved in foreign entanglements and of course they have a ship called the George Washington doing the opposite of that.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.562]  Secretary of State Clinton calls for Israel to investigate itself in flotilla incident.
[00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:45.988]  That's Infowars.com, Curt Nemo.
[00:24:45.988 --> 00:24:52.214]  American 19 among Gaza flotilla dead.
[00:24:52.214 --> 00:24:55.537]  And now the news is reporting it is more than 9 dead.
[00:24:55.537 --> 00:25:01.243]  It looks like the original number is correct of 19 dead.
[00:25:01.243 --> 00:25:05.186]  Jerusalem Post reports Navy prepares to confront more ships.
[00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:12.389]  And now Turkey is saying they are sending ships to convoy with them.
[00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:15.991]  So that crisis is still still looming.
[00:25:15.991 --> 00:25:18.053]  We'll cover that in the third hour today.
[00:25:18.053 --> 00:25:23.817]  The former Israeli naval captain and Mossad officer who's critical of this.
[00:25:23.817 --> 00:25:31.722]  Fears of new flashpoint as defiant Israel prepares for showdown with two more Gaza aid ships.
[00:25:34.893 --> 00:25:46.682]  And Gaza-aid flotilla activists who were released by Israel arrived a hero's welcome in Turkey, including a small 18-month-old baby.
[00:25:46.682 --> 00:25:52.866]  Different blogs have discovered misleading photos used by Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs to justify killing activists.
[00:25:52.866 --> 00:26:02.814]  Turns out some of the photos are three years old of binoculars and night vision, as well as body armor marked Turkish police.
[00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.771]  Just standard government lying.
[00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:11.352]  Shifting gears into the oil spill.
[00:26:11.352 --> 00:26:13.593]  Nuclear option on Gulf oil spill.
[00:26:13.593 --> 00:26:14.933]  No way, U.S.
[00:26:14.933 --> 00:26:15.173]  says.
[00:26:15.173 --> 00:26:22.876]  We first reported on Tuesday that they were discussing using a hydrogen bomb to seal the oil well.
[00:26:22.876 --> 00:26:30.979]  The oil well leaking deeper down is already spread into other fissures and there's at least three plumes several miles away.
[00:26:32.415 --> 00:26:34.296]  So it's just ongoing.
[00:26:34.296 --> 00:26:40.539]  Also, it turns out Goldman Sachs sold 250 million of British Petroleum stocks before the spill.
[00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:41.860]  They're White House insiders.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.641]  Goldman Sachs basically runs the White House.
[00:26:43.641 --> 00:26:46.102]  That's more evidence of this being a staged event.
[00:26:46.102 --> 00:26:50.665]  So Obama can go ahead and pass his greenhouse gas taxes on the back of all this anger.
[00:26:51.522 --> 00:27:00.147]  Oh sure, and of course it's BP that's invested billions of dollars in the fake green movement to get the carbon tax, which their central bank owners will profit from.
[00:27:00.147 --> 00:27:02.869]  So what do they care if some subsidiary loses face?
[00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:05.410]  They'll just change the name or shift things around.
[00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:12.234]  And the fact that you did have a record dumping of stock right before it happened, even though oil stocks were generally up, is very suspicious.
[00:27:12.594 --> 00:27:19.301]  Firm's stock sale nearly twice as large as any other institution represented 44% of total BP investment.
[00:27:19.301 --> 00:27:29.410]  The brokerage firm that faced the most scrutiny from regulators in the past year over for the shorting of mortgage-related securities seems to have had good timing when it came to something else.
[00:27:30.051 --> 00:27:32.353]  The stocks of British oil giant BP.
[00:27:32.353 --> 00:27:34.996]  They didn't dump other big oil stocks they own.
[00:27:34.996 --> 00:27:36.358]  No, just BP.
[00:27:36.358 --> 00:27:42.984]  According to regulatory filings, they found that Goldman Sachs sold 4,680... 4 million, excuse me...
[00:27:49.028 --> 00:27:49.428]  We're good to go.
[00:28:11.992 --> 00:28:20.017]  If Goldman had sold these shares today, their investment would have lost 36% in value, or $96 million.
[00:28:20.017 --> 00:28:31.423]  The share sales represented 44% of Goldman's holdings, meaning that Goldman remaining holdings have still lost tens of millions in value.
[00:28:31.423 --> 00:28:33.064]  And they sold this just days before.
[00:28:33.064 --> 00:28:34.125]  How suspicious is that?
[00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:41.865]  So continuing, CNN, Obama uses Gulf oil spill for energy agenda push.
[00:28:41.865 --> 00:28:45.788]  See, they're not calling it carbon tax now, they call it an energy agenda.
[00:28:45.788 --> 00:28:47.509]  Like Austin calls it an energy agenda.
[00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:55.074]  Oh, here's 2.6 billion in taxes in the next three years, totaling more than all the other taxes combined, and it'll go to private offshore banks.
[00:28:55.074 --> 00:28:56.355]  Sit down and take it.
[00:28:56.355 --> 00:28:58.616]  If you don't like it, we'll turn your power off.
[00:28:58.616 --> 00:29:02.619]  If you don't like that, we'll come take your house now if you don't pay your power bill afterwards.
[00:29:02.619 --> 00:29:05.921]  And if you don't leave your house, the Austin SWAT team will kill you deader than a hammer!
[00:29:06.621 --> 00:29:11.843]  Yeah!
[00:29:11.843 --> 00:29:16.224]  The whole world is a bunch of cowardly people ready to get raped.
[00:29:16.224 --> 00:29:18.745]  And as long as you take it, they're going to keep doing it.
[00:29:18.745 --> 00:29:21.626]  I'm just mentioning the town where I live, the raping that's going on.
[00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:25.487]  Obama uses Gulf oil spill for energy agenda push.
[00:29:25.487 --> 00:29:29.188]  Ah, it's going to work absolutely well now.
[00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:30.369]  And we'll cover that when we get back.
[00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:33.530]  And of course, Goldman Sachs got out right on time.
[00:29:34.645 --> 00:29:36.626]  Right on time.
[00:29:36.626 --> 00:29:39.267]  Right on time, just like they always do.
[00:29:39.267 --> 00:29:42.008]  They've got every position in the White House of any power.
[00:29:42.008 --> 00:29:48.170]  And they've got their new Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, who says, ban the Second Amendment and free speech.
[00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:49.951]  And she's a former Goldman Sachs member.
[00:29:49.951 --> 00:29:50.611]  Oh, yeah.
[00:29:50.611 --> 00:29:52.012]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.012 --> 00:29:54.533]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.533 --> 00:29:57.214]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.892 --> 00:30:01.192]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.192 --> 00:30:06.774]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:06.774 --> 00:30:11.796]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:11.796 --> 00:30:16.838]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:17.378 --> 00:30:22.602]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:22.602 --> 00:30:24.903]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:30:24.903 --> 00:30:29.706]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:29.706 --> 00:30:30.827]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:30.827 --> 00:30:33.889]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:37.532]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:37.532 --> 00:30:40.714]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:30:40.714 --> 00:30:42.935]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:30:42.935 --> 00:30:43.856]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:47.578 --> 00:30:51.724]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:51.724 --> 00:30:56.571]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:56.571 --> 00:30:58.955]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.273]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.273 --> 00:31:08.600]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.662]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:10.662 --> 00:31:15.668]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:15.668 --> 00:31:16.849]  How much do you want?
[00:31:16.849 --> 00:31:17.570]  When do you want it?
[00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.831]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:19.831 --> 00:31:20.911]  When will you need it?
[00:31:20.911 --> 00:31:23.112]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.112 --> 00:31:24.453]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.453 --> 00:31:25.973]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:25.973 --> 00:31:31.255]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.255 --> 00:31:34.837]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:34.837 --> 00:31:38.298]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:38.658 --> 00:31:39.880]  How much will you need?
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.781]  We don't know.
[00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:41.882]  How much do you want?
[00:31:41.882 --> 00:31:42.623]  All you can get.
[00:31:42.623 --> 00:31:43.904]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:43.904 --> 00:31:46.968]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:46.968 --> 00:31:49.171]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:50.172]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:59.383 --> 00:32:00.685]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:06.272]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:32:06.272 --> 00:32:11.299]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:16.345]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:32:16.866 --> 00:32:22.090]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.391]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:32:24.391 --> 00:32:29.194]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:29.194 --> 00:32:30.315]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:33.397]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:32:33.397 --> 00:32:37.020]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.202]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:32:40.202 --> 00:32:42.423]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:32:42.423 --> 00:32:43.344]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:46.986 --> 00:32:49.950]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:56.057]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:56.057 --> 00:32:58.440]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:17.170]  How outrageous!
[00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:39.661]  You got Buzzy Crongar, Executive Director of the CIA, old Buzzy Crongard, putting in a record put option, dumping American and United stock through the big brokerage firm he headed, separately, in the four days before 9-11.
[00:33:39.661 --> 00:33:39.781]  Record!
[00:33:41.801 --> 00:33:56.373]  Well over triple the biggest put option against an airline in history, but it was two airlines and the exact two that were involved in the hijack kamikaze attacks.
[00:33:56.373 --> 00:34:01.016]  By the way, that was in Der Spiegel and Reuters and even a few U.S.
[00:34:01.016 --> 00:34:03.238]  newspapers, but there was going to be an investigation.
[00:34:03.238 --> 00:34:04.939]  Nothing happened.
[00:34:04.939 --> 00:34:08.062]  And then you get British Petroleum.
[00:34:08.062 --> 00:34:10.444]  It doesn't get any more New World Order than that.
[00:34:11.277 --> 00:34:18.920]  Top globalist Queen Beatrix and the Queen of England, the Queen of the Netherlands and the Queen of England jointly own the company together.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.101]  They control the company on record.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:34.206]  It's a top Bilderberg Group company pushing the carbon taxes when you're in an airport or you're looking at billboards or you're looking at a magazine like The Economist.
[00:34:34.206 --> 00:34:39.850]  Every four or five pages is a BP ad the last five years pushing global government carbon taxes.
[00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:54.660]  And now their whole carbon tax situation is in trouble and magically an oil rig that a month before the disaster 36 days ago gets a award from the Obama administration for safety and then it blows up.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.142]  And it's leaking oil and BP can't put it out.
[00:34:59.142 --> 00:35:02.763]  Can't, you know, stop the leak.
[00:35:02.763 --> 00:35:07.185]  And they don't put bacteria, microbes that could eat the oil in at the source.
[00:35:07.185 --> 00:35:11.107]  They didn't light it on fire day one as they should have done as another recourse.
[00:35:11.107 --> 00:35:13.208]  They just can't seem to seal it.
[00:35:13.208 --> 00:35:15.929]  And now they're saying this could go on for years.
[00:35:15.929 --> 00:35:18.770]  Yesterday it was till Christmas, another six months.
[00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.071]  Now it could be years.
[00:35:20.071 --> 00:35:21.151]  Now it could be forever.
[00:35:21.151 --> 00:35:21.532]  Sorry!
[00:35:21.532 --> 00:35:22.312]  Sorry!
[00:35:26.408 --> 00:35:36.639]  And Goldman Sachs dumps 4,680,822 shares of BP, a record oil company dump, the biggest in their history, two days before the spill.
[00:35:45.285 --> 00:35:53.228]  Just like their own email said in 2005, 2006, sell these subprime mortgages.
[00:35:53.228 --> 00:35:57.330]  Sell them to governments, to other banks, to cities, to pension funds.
[00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.331]  We're going to be dumping them behind the scenes.
[00:35:59.331 --> 00:36:01.612]  This will destroy Lehman Brothers.
[00:36:01.612 --> 00:36:03.473]  This will destroy Bear Stearns.
[00:36:03.473 --> 00:36:08.175]  Oh my God, we're going to make so much money selling it on the way up and on the way down.
[00:36:08.175 --> 00:36:09.575]  We'll take over everything.
[00:36:09.575 --> 00:36:10.556]  Oh, it's so good!
[00:36:11.553 --> 00:36:17.258]  I've got all these other emails now out from him calling everyone dumb scum and BP calling everyone dumb scum.
[00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:19.239]  You're all dumb scum.
[00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:29.668]  Just like the head of Apple, you know, telling you how great the slave factories are today and we've got the head of Facebook calling you dumb effing idiots.
[00:36:32.015 --> 00:36:35.316]  The stupid schmuck public trust us so much.
[00:36:35.316 --> 00:36:37.536]  Oh, it's so good to rip them off.
[00:36:37.536 --> 00:36:38.557]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:36:38.557 --> 00:36:42.098]  And the public's like, yes, we love being gullible idiots.
[00:36:42.098 --> 00:36:44.018]  We want to watch basketball.
[00:36:44.018 --> 00:36:45.399]  That's what's important.
[00:36:45.399 --> 00:36:47.319]  Rape us, rape us, rape us.
[00:36:47.319 --> 00:36:50.480]  And they're like, oh, we will, don't worry.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.880]  What was the quote of the head of Facebook?
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.661]  These people are so gullible and dumb, they trust us.
[00:36:54.661 --> 00:36:58.602]  In fact, guys, go to YouTube.
[00:36:59.534 --> 00:37:01.356]  Pull up!
[00:37:01.356 --> 00:37:06.400]  Ending scene, final scene of Face in the Crowd.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:13.345]  What's the name of the actor that played the sheriff from Andy Griffith?
[00:37:13.345 --> 00:37:14.727]  I don't think that's his real name, though.
[00:37:14.727 --> 00:37:18.830]  I mean, what's the actor's name?
[00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:19.430]  Andy Griffith.
[00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.732]  Okay, so I guess he uses his own name in the show.
[00:37:21.732 --> 00:37:23.874]  And then, of course, there's Barney Fife.
[00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:27.958]  But he also played an evil con artist media personality.
[00:37:29.315 --> 00:37:30.936]  Yeah, Lonesome Roads.
[00:37:30.936 --> 00:37:32.396]  Find a final scene of Lonesome Roads.
[00:37:32.396 --> 00:37:34.157]  We go live on TV later.
[00:37:34.157 --> 00:37:35.277]  I want to play that.
[00:37:35.277 --> 00:37:36.898]  And he had everybody conned.
[00:37:36.898 --> 00:37:40.479]  First he conned the small town, then he conned everybody internationally on television.
[00:37:40.479 --> 00:37:42.220]  Kind of like a Glenn Beck character.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:49.403]  And then at the end of it, the television mic is still live and he's going, you dumb, filthy scum!
[00:37:49.403 --> 00:37:51.363]  You gullible idiots!
[00:37:51.363 --> 00:37:54.425]  I'm ripping you off!
[00:37:54.425 --> 00:37:56.145]  And that destroyed him in the movie.
[00:37:56.145 --> 00:37:57.606]  Ah, that doesn't destroy the government here.
[00:37:58.908 --> 00:38:01.371]  You can have thousands of times they've lied to us.
[00:38:01.371 --> 00:38:04.775]  They can admit they make fake Al-Qaeda videos, fake Bin Laden videos.
[00:38:04.775 --> 00:38:08.420]  They can admit they put out, you know, fake news.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.545]  They can admit they're shipping heroin into the country.
[00:38:12.545 --> 00:38:14.207]  And the public goes, good!
[00:38:14.207 --> 00:38:15.188]  Good!
[00:38:15.188 --> 00:38:15.589]  Good!
[00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:16.330]  Rip us off!
[00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.453]  We don't like the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones who tells us not to trust the government.
[00:38:20.453 --> 00:38:22.995]  We want to have our pension funds taken.
[00:38:22.995 --> 00:38:24.396]  We want to be raped.
[00:38:24.396 --> 00:38:25.837]  We want to be scammed.
[00:38:25.837 --> 00:38:27.519]  We enjoy it.
[00:38:27.519 --> 00:38:31.061]  We love drinking sodium fluoride and hundreds of other deadly poisons.
[00:38:31.061 --> 00:38:35.885]  We love injecting our children and watching them flop around and be brain damaged and have convulsions.
[00:38:35.885 --> 00:38:37.186]  We love having cancer.
[00:38:37.186 --> 00:38:38.147]  We love dying.
[00:38:38.147 --> 00:38:39.448]  We love being scammed.
[00:38:39.448 --> 00:38:40.669]  We love being conned.
[00:38:40.669 --> 00:38:42.891]  There isn't a con we haven't found we don't love.
[00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:47.388]  Now, here's the good news.
[00:38:47.388 --> 00:38:54.896]  That is a smaller and smaller and smaller sub-segment of the public.
[00:38:54.896 --> 00:39:04.206]  As Brzezinski bemoaned two and a half weeks ago, the world is waking up to their new world order.
[00:39:04.206 --> 00:39:07.590]  The world is waking up to the global government.
[00:39:11.715 --> 00:39:17.920]  For the first time in history, the entire planet is awake to global government.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:25.686]  Because that means the average dumbo in the street, who five years ago was calling me a... kook, has to admit there's a world government.
[00:39:25.686 --> 00:39:27.167]  Go to the Drudge Report today.
[00:39:27.167 --> 00:39:31.370]  One of the top stories is the Bilderberg Group calling for world government.
[00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:37.916]  You got a mainstream news article, they're going, okay, there is a secret cabal, they do want a world government, but maybe it's good for you.
[00:39:39.482 --> 00:39:41.664]  Like the Financial Times of London.
[00:39:41.664 --> 00:39:43.545]  Drudge, to his credit, is not saying it's good.
[00:39:43.545 --> 00:39:50.110]  And then I saw a clip last week of Beck calling people that talk about the Bilderberg Group, kooks.
[00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:54.514]  He says, oh, there's a world government, but people think it's Bilderberg or kooks.
[00:39:54.514 --> 00:40:01.699]  Glenn, Glenn, Jim Tucker and others have dug through for 30 years the trash of the hotels.
[00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.320]  They've snuck in and been arrested.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.962]  Jim Tucker has been shot at.
[00:40:06.989 --> 00:40:09.350]  In 1999 in Portugal.
[00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.951]  Shot at!
[00:40:10.951 --> 00:40:11.991]  That was in the local papers.
[00:40:11.991 --> 00:40:16.993]  They fired shots at him as he climbed over the ivies.
[00:40:16.993 --> 00:40:18.114]  He's not a spring chicken anymore.
[00:40:18.114 --> 00:40:20.775]  He can't do that.
[00:40:20.775 --> 00:40:23.196]  They are setting up world government, pal.
[00:40:23.196 --> 00:40:26.658]  They are one of the top echelons of the world government, buddy boy.
[00:40:27.901 --> 00:40:30.563]  I mean, why doesn't Rush Limbaugh admit there's a world government?
[00:40:30.563 --> 00:40:32.365]  I don't want to sit here and bash Rush.
[00:40:32.365 --> 00:40:35.768]  Come on, Rush, you could save the country if you'd come clean about world government.
[00:40:35.768 --> 00:40:37.829]  You too, Glenn Beck.
[00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:39.231]  You too, Sean Hannity.
[00:40:39.231 --> 00:40:41.573]  Knock it off!
[00:40:41.573 --> 00:40:43.855]  Stop saying I'm a kook, okay?
[00:40:43.855 --> 00:40:44.795]  I'm not a kook.
[00:40:44.795 --> 00:40:46.537]  I'm red-blooded.
[00:40:46.537 --> 00:40:47.678]  I'm trying to save this country.
[00:40:52.276 --> 00:40:54.419]  Okay, I was ranting there.
[00:40:54.419 --> 00:40:55.260]  Here's CNN.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.085]  Obama uses Gulf oil spill for energy agenda push.
[00:41:01.972 --> 00:41:06.674]  And he's saying, oh, this shows we need more federal regulation and we need new money to clean this up.
[00:41:06.674 --> 00:41:12.417]  He wants an overall tax on all of your gasoline and carbon taxes on all factories.
[00:41:12.417 --> 00:41:17.960]  But don't worry, they're already pretty much shut down, or federalized, and that's mission accomplished.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.721]  GM's not going to make mercury anymore.
[00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:23.723]  You're not going to be able to buy you a mercury and drive it up and down the road.
[00:41:24.946 --> 00:41:27.167]  Like Alan Jackson talks about.
[00:41:27.167 --> 00:41:28.127]  No, sir.
[00:41:28.127 --> 00:41:31.167]  You're not going to buy you a Mercury and drive it up and down the road.
[00:41:31.167 --> 00:41:37.649]  I'm going to buy me a Mercury and drive it up and down the road.
[00:41:37.649 --> 00:41:38.809]  No, you're not.
[00:41:38.809 --> 00:41:40.130]  You're not going to make Diddley squat.
[00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.690]  You're going to learn to worship government.
[00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.610]  They're going to bankrupt you and make you dependent.
[00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:51.432]  They're going to make you learn to lick the boots of the machine gun toting proto-neo-hippies.
[00:41:51.432 --> 00:41:54.313]  You're going to learn to love Trotsky, you understand?
[00:41:55.595 --> 00:41:58.117]  BP tries again to cap well.
[00:41:58.117 --> 00:42:02.220]  Protests set to start.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.521]  This is the dialectic.
[00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:04.862]  People are egging their buildings.
[00:42:04.862 --> 00:42:06.303]  They're attacking BP stations.
[00:42:06.303 --> 00:42:07.624]  They're knocking out their windows.
[00:42:07.624 --> 00:42:08.926]  They're protesting.
[00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.487]  And BP says, don't do it.
[00:42:10.487 --> 00:42:12.728]  It'll hurt the local BP franchise owners.
[00:42:12.728 --> 00:42:13.649]  Don't do it!
[00:42:13.649 --> 00:42:14.190]  Don't do it!
[00:42:15.356 --> 00:42:15.996]  Don't do it.
[00:42:45.616 --> 00:42:47.937]  At this being a staged event.
[00:42:47.937 --> 00:42:56.001]  It's taken me 36, 37 days to be able to say that, but all the evidence is pointing at it, and we'll explain why.
[00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:56.721]  We'll explain why.
[00:42:56.721 --> 00:43:14.070]  I mean, the biggest thing is, just like FEMA blocked off aid, and wouldn't let the Coast Guard in, and wouldn't let Walmart in, and wouldn't let all the police and National Guard at first hand, and wouldn't let them give aid to people, wouldn't let people walk out on the highways, wouldn't let them, told them go to the Superdome and starve,
[00:43:15.325 --> 00:43:15.465]  It was
[00:43:31.392 --> 00:43:33.853]  And hurting all the other oil companies.
[00:43:33.853 --> 00:43:43.398]  You know, ExxonMobil wouldn't do it until David Rockefeller went to the board meeting and pointed out, this was in the news, that he owns still all the major stock of the major 12 US oil companies.
[00:43:43.398 --> 00:43:45.540]  He said, I will remove you, Rex Tillerson.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.661]  You will come out and call for global government.
[00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:51.183]  And two days later, Rex Tillerson was in the news saying, I want a global carbon tax.
[00:43:51.183 --> 00:43:52.363]  I want wellhead taxes.
[00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:53.884]  I want it all.
[00:43:53.884 --> 00:43:55.065]  And that was the end of it.
[00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:55.505]  Remember that?
[00:43:57.705 --> 00:44:06.149]  Well, notice it's BP and notice now Goldman Sachs, the insiders, dumped more than half their stock right before it happened.
[00:44:06.149 --> 00:44:06.930]  Bring me Watson.
[00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:09.631]  Watson, are you there?
[00:44:09.631 --> 00:44:13.773]  I know you're working on a big Bilderberg report right now on Brzezinski and that's important.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:24.888]  Uh, but I am ready to say that it's a 90 plus percent, let's just say 90 percent chance that this is an inside job that needs to be investigated.
[00:44:24.888 --> 00:44:30.814]  You got the raw story, getting the foyer documents with their regulatory filings.
[00:44:31.494 --> 00:44:31.714]  I think?
[00:44:50.206 --> 00:44:52.267]  We're good to go.
[00:45:10.713 --> 00:45:28.874]  You have the fact that they will not cap it, that they got the award a month before, that Obama is now calling for his carbon taxes and wellhead taxes and pump taxes, so oil company taxes, citizen taxes at the pump, and carbon taxes when their whole agenda is stalled to set up the world government and fund it.
[00:45:28.874 --> 00:45:30.375]  We know their dialectic of FEMA.
[00:45:31.618 --> 00:45:33.338]  I can't say for sure, Alex, but it seems like BP
[00:45:59.807 --> 00:46:10.878]  And the government is more concerned about managing the public relations aspect of what's going on rather than stopping the actual leak.
[00:46:12.008 --> 00:46:27.331]  Well, we know governments and corporations nexus together, even the Washington Post admits today that OK, BP is basically the big umbrella controller of the fake eugenics climate control movement.
[00:46:27.331 --> 00:46:33.333]  And we need an article, or I can get Kurt or your brothers and they're working on this other one, so call one of them.
[00:46:34.249 --> 00:46:38.491]  Well, it's interesting that they tried to get James Cameron to work with BBC to manage it, the Hollywood film director.
[00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:42.292]  And yeah, as you said, all the top environmental groups are tied in, tied to the head with the oil companies.
[00:47:04.365 --> 00:47:09.007]  Because they both benefit from the fraudulent global warming agenda.
[00:47:09.007 --> 00:47:19.391]  The environmental groups get the power out of it, and the oil corporations get to create artificial scarcity and new taxes which they pass on to us.
[00:47:19.391 --> 00:47:21.612]  Well, Watson, correct me if I'm wrong, though.
[00:47:21.612 --> 00:47:32.197]  I mean, at first, some groups did approach Cameron because he, of course, has covered the Titanic as an expert, you know, at least in deploying robotic
[00:47:33.397 --> 00:47:54.463]  Yeah, he was involved in a brainstorming session with basically the government and scientists on Tuesday, and then he came out of the meeting and basically said they're stupid, they don't know what they're doing.
[00:47:54.463 --> 00:48:00.585]  So, I mean, you were making the point that there are now these microbes that eat up oil,
[00:48:01.724 --> 00:48:04.246]  That's not being explored properly.
[00:48:04.246 --> 00:48:13.452]  And merely the fact that oil itself is naturally occurring and that the environmental damage may be being hyped by the media.
[00:48:13.452 --> 00:48:23.279]  Obviously the worst thing about it is the government shut down miles and miles of fishing regions in that area and businesses are dying as a result of it.
[00:48:27.762 --> 00:48:29.643]  Well said, Watson.
[00:48:29.643 --> 00:48:31.404]  And it just gets more and more suspicious.
[00:48:31.404 --> 00:48:41.150]  And of course, there are natural microbes, New Scientist reports, that would, in just a year or so, eat almost all of this oil.
[00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:44.152]  They just kept it out of the marshes.
[00:48:44.152 --> 00:48:46.414]  That's the most important thing, but they're not doing that.
[00:48:47.988 --> 00:48:53.472]  They're not burning it off as they've always done in the past, because that would create carbon dioxide.
[00:48:53.472 --> 00:48:57.656]  So either way you slice it, this is a serious, serious situation.
[00:48:57.656 --> 00:49:03.480]  And now Obama says, hey, get ready for this to go on until Christmas, maybe years.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.081]  This is just the way it is.
[00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:08.624]  And you better believe they're going to really try to get their carbon taxes out of this.
[00:49:08.624 --> 00:49:10.486]  They now admit they're doing it.
[00:49:10.486 --> 00:49:11.506]  And carbon taxes,
[00:49:12.386 --> 00:49:12.726]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:49:36.997 --> 00:49:40.862]  Alright, there goes Paul Watson popping in with us.
[00:49:40.862 --> 00:49:44.347]  Okay, I said I'd go to calls, and we've got people holding.
[00:49:45.984 --> 00:49:49.707]  But I've got four stacks of news and I haven't even gotten into half of one of them.
[00:49:49.707 --> 00:49:52.409]  I kind of got stuck on my BP ranting.
[00:49:52.409 --> 00:49:57.613]  I've got Daily Chicago threatens to arrest 80 plus year old for defending himself and his home.
[00:49:57.613 --> 00:49:59.594]  That's mainstream news.
[00:49:59.594 --> 00:50:09.522]  I've got premiums on gold bullion coins surge as gold shortages intensified at record levels worldwide.
[00:50:09.522 --> 00:50:13.285]  We've got just amazing news
[00:50:14.717 --> 00:50:18.218]  Continuing on the BP front.
[00:50:18.218 --> 00:50:23.080]  Washington Post exposes BP ties to eco-groups other media ignores.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:23.900]  Controversy.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:27.562]  That's from the Business and Media Institute.
[00:50:27.562 --> 00:50:28.862]  BP oil leak.
[00:50:28.862 --> 00:50:29.982]  May last until Christmas.
[00:50:29.982 --> 00:50:31.023]  A worst-case scenario.
[00:50:31.023 --> 00:50:33.224]  Bloomberg boycotting BP.
[00:50:33.224 --> 00:50:34.064]  Who gets hurt?
[00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:34.884]  AP.
[00:50:34.884 --> 00:50:36.945]  Saying don't boycott BP.
[00:50:36.945 --> 00:50:37.925]  They're good environmentalists.
[00:50:37.925 --> 00:50:39.286]  They're helping us get carbon taxes.
[00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:43.108]  Good job BP, good job blowing that.
[00:50:43.108 --> 00:50:44.969]  That's what they ought to say.
[00:50:44.969 --> 00:50:46.650]  And of course, here's the article.
[00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:51.573]  Director James Cameron says BP turned down help of oil offer.
[00:50:51.573 --> 00:50:53.534]  And we've got good news.
[00:50:53.534 --> 00:50:57.076]  More incumbents being thrown out of office on every front.
[00:50:57.076 --> 00:50:59.097]  This is a full strike.
[00:50:59.097 --> 00:51:02.639]  We'll be back.
[00:51:02.639 --> 00:51:03.860]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.721]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.442 --> 00:51:06.782]  We're good.
[00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:27.250]  We're good to go!

[00:51:58.676 --> 00:52:04.979]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:52:04.979 --> 00:52:06.240]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.981]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.981 --> 00:52:12.403]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.403 --> 00:52:18.265]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.265 --> 00:52:24.488]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.924 --> 00:52:30.888]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.888 --> 00:52:35.092]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.092 --> 00:52:39.375]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:45.319]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.319 --> 00:52:48.882]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.882 --> 00:52:50.263]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.843 --> 00:52:51.984]  It's here.

[00:53:03.429 --> 00:53:07.330]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:11.052]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:53:11.052 --> 00:53:17.975]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:53:17.995 --> 00:53:18.456]  I think so.
[00:53:33.072 --> 00:53:34.073]  Big Berkey Water Filters dot com.

[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:10.044]  Coming up during the next hour, we got Jim Tucker and others joining us from Sigis, Spain.
[00:54:10.044 --> 00:54:12.265]  Breakdown what's happening with Bilderberg Group 2010.
[00:54:12.265 --> 00:54:22.172]  We're also going to start simulcasting sometime in the next hour at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:54:22.172 --> 00:54:32.600]  Really exciting news on the front dealing with incumbents
[00:54:33.865 --> 00:54:38.686]  Stop saying crap about the New World Order.
[00:54:38.686 --> 00:54:40.806]  It's gonna win.
[00:54:40.806 --> 00:54:43.247]  You can't defeat it.
[00:54:43.247 --> 00:54:44.247]  You're just a scared coward.
[00:55:04.625 --> 00:55:07.046]  Let's talk to Ralph in Illinois.
[00:55:07.046 --> 00:55:07.946]  Ralph, you're on the air.
[00:55:07.946 --> 00:55:15.610]  Alex, my friend, brother, what a pleasure it is to talk to you.
[00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:23.633]  And I just gotta tell you, I'm a retired iron worker from Local One here in Chicago.
[00:55:23.633 --> 00:55:31.957]  I understand exactly what these, what cover-ups, you know, from the media can do.
[00:55:31.957 --> 00:55:32.877]  I mean, I've known
[00:55:33.522 --> 00:55:40.985]  A lot of Brother Ironworkers did when I would tell them, you know, about those buildings were imploded, you know.
[00:55:40.985 --> 00:55:44.666]  Ah, you're crazy, you're high, and all this.
[00:55:44.666 --> 00:55:52.629]  But what I really wanted to do is maybe plant a seed.
[00:55:52.629 --> 00:55:56.650]  Are you familiar with Shepherd's Chapel or Pastor Murray?
[00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:56.690]  No.
[00:55:58.883 --> 00:56:03.425]  Now he teaches the Bible chapter by chapter, verse by verse.
[00:56:03.425 --> 00:56:07.087]  Been doing it for about 50 years.
[00:56:07.087 --> 00:56:19.112]  And just the insight I've got from him, from the couple years, several years that I've been listening to his teaching.
[00:56:19.112 --> 00:56:22.794]  But have you ever heard the term Kenite?
[00:56:25.191 --> 00:56:26.893]  I think that was a tribe in the Bible.
[00:56:26.893 --> 00:56:29.076]  I remember reading something about that in the Old Testament.
[00:56:37.529 --> 00:56:40.571]  Cain being the first and then...
[00:57:07.889 --> 00:57:10.231]  But you know what?
[00:57:10.231 --> 00:57:14.013]  I mean, you know, like the black Muslims, they think the whites are the devils.
[00:57:14.013 --> 00:57:17.796]  You got a lot of the Rastafarians who think whites are the devils.
[00:57:17.796 --> 00:57:25.141]  And that, you know, the king of Ethiopia was basically the messiah.
[00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:28.703]  And of course, you notice he died.
[00:57:28.703 --> 00:57:32.926]  And I mean, it seems like every group thinks they're the chosen group and everybody else is the devil.
[00:57:32.926 --> 00:57:36.128]  And I just, you know, I really don't subscribe to that.
[00:57:38.729 --> 00:57:40.369]  But I appreciate your call.
[00:57:40.369 --> 00:57:42.470]  Okay, let's talk to Mike in Arizona.
[00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:44.290]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:45.430]  Yes, good morning, Alex.
[00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:47.291]  This is Michael Nesser calling from Arizona.
[00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.231]  I'd like to talk about this Gaza issue.
[00:57:49.231 --> 00:57:49.811]  Yes.
[00:57:49.811 --> 00:57:53.872]  You know, what we do is we need to strike at the root of this.
[00:57:53.872 --> 00:58:04.354]  You know, sometimes when we get into the debate about the raid, of if they should have done it, or if it was international, or water, or anything like that, what we have to do is, again, strike at the root.
[00:58:04.354 --> 00:58:07.835]  We have to realize that all of the land belongs to the Arabs.
[00:58:08.268 --> 00:58:08.508]  I think?
[00:58:30.174 --> 00:58:31.736]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:31.736 --> 00:58:32.277]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:55.781]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:55.781 --> 00:59:04.644]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:04.644 --> 00:59:09.265]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:09.265 --> 00:59:20.089]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:20.729 --> 00:59:30.238]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:30.238 --> 00:59:35.683]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:35.683 --> 00:59:43.169]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:43.169 --> 00:59:45.912]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:59:53.183 --> 00:59:55.587]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.587 --> 01:00:00.954]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:00.954 --> 01:00:02.075]  Big Brother.
[01:00:02.075 --> 01:00:03.718]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:09.913]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.913 --> 01:00:11.494]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.494 --> 01:00:12.734]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:17.236]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.236 --> 01:00:25.020]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.242]  Well, the incumbent lost in Alabama yesterday.
[01:00:29.369 --> 01:00:32.251]  The incumbent lost in Hawaii.
[01:00:32.251 --> 01:00:33.873]  The incumbent lost in Utah.
[01:00:33.873 --> 01:00:38.096]  The incumbent, our establishment candidate, lost in Kentucky.
[01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:39.778]  It's every single race.
[01:00:39.778 --> 01:00:43.681]  No incumbent, whether it's Arlen Specter, it doesn't matter.
[01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:48.025]  No one who is an incumbent or seen as the establishment candidate is winning.
[01:00:48.025 --> 01:00:54.090]  And Rand Paul has extended his lead over Conway despite racism smear.
[01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:55.070]  This is a key article.
[01:00:55.991 --> 01:01:00.433]  That is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:00.433 --> 01:01:01.954]  We need to get out there to everybody.
[01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:06.596]  The media demonized Rand Paul for the last two weeks.
[01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:07.656]  And what happened?
[01:01:07.656 --> 01:01:14.299]  Multiple polls showed that his lead only got bigger.
[01:01:20.014 --> 01:01:24.996]  His lead only got bigger in one poll by six points and another poll by four points.
[01:01:24.996 --> 01:01:33.161]  His poll only got bigger.
[01:01:33.161 --> 01:01:34.541]  Now, what does that tell you?
[01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:39.424]  It tells you the establishment is crashing and burning and that's why they're going to stage a new war, an economic collapse.
[01:01:39.424 --> 01:01:46.347]  Heaven knows, because they understand this is not one party out of favor where all the Democrats get thrown out or all the Republicans get thrown out.
[01:01:46.347 --> 01:01:47.748]  That baiting and switching is over.
[01:01:48.652 --> 01:01:49.953]  And this will be the last cycle.
[01:01:49.953 --> 01:01:54.737]  They'll put a bunch of Republicans in, because they're mainly the anti-incumbency.
[01:01:54.737 --> 01:02:02.524]  Most of them are going to get bought off, and then people are going to go completely ape, and it's going to be just independence.
[01:02:02.524 --> 01:02:06.407]  And the states are all rebelling and revolting and taking back their power.
[01:02:06.407 --> 01:02:09.349]  The globalists are in trouble, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:11.211]  The globalists are in big trouble.
[01:02:11.211 --> 01:02:12.972]  Okay.
[01:02:12.972 --> 01:02:14.414]  I just got two phone calls
[01:02:16.648 --> 01:02:19.311]  from people bringing up dealing with the flotilla
[01:02:22.225 --> 01:02:24.346]  Racial identity of the Jews.
[01:02:24.346 --> 01:02:26.167]  I think that's where that was going.
[01:02:26.167 --> 01:02:27.468]  And I've opened the phones up for whatever.
[01:02:27.468 --> 01:02:32.870]  And I don't know if it's buddies that are calling in or just random chants.
[01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:39.593]  Sometimes I'll have like five mics in a row call in or five people, six people will call in from New Jersey in a row.
[01:02:39.593 --> 01:02:45.836]  But I mean, I don't see what any of this has to do with the issue of is this attack on the flotilla right or wrong?
[01:02:45.836 --> 01:02:47.597]  And I think it was a debacle and wrong.
[01:02:50.165 --> 01:03:03.898]  You know, I just don't get into the black roster firing and saying white people are the devil, or La Raza and Mecha saying Hispanics are angels and whites are the devil, or saying blacks and Jews are the devil.
[01:03:03.898 --> 01:03:06.740]  I just, every group loves to walk around thinking they're God.
[01:03:07.661 --> 01:03:08.762]  And, uh, you know what?
[01:03:08.762 --> 01:03:11.205]  I'm just a freedom lover who wants freedom for everybody.
[01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:15.489]  Uh, but go ahead and tell me about Khazars from Northern Georgia and converting.
[01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:17.350]  And I mean, I, I do know about that.
[01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:19.733]  And, and Kessler's the 13th tribe.
[01:03:19.733 --> 01:03:21.394]  I mean, I knew about that 20 years ago.
[01:03:23.055 --> 01:03:26.597]  But I mean, specifically, what does that have to do with the flotilla?
[01:03:26.597 --> 01:03:37.821]  I understand that only, what, 20% of the Jews in Israel are really Sephardic, from North Africa or from Spain, who really are originally from there.
[01:03:37.821 --> 01:03:47.285]  And so my issue is, are you saying that people from North Africa or wherever, are you saying they have no right to any land there?
[01:03:48.823 --> 01:03:50.807]  Well, that's the beginning of it.
[01:03:50.807 --> 01:03:51.890]  Okay, let me ask you this.
[01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:57.020]  Should all white people leave North America, like Mecha says, because we came and took this land?
[01:03:58.203 --> 01:04:00.204]  Well, I'm not going to divert the conversation.
[01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:01.764]  We're not talking about Mechon.
[01:04:01.764 --> 01:04:03.344]  We're not talking about this and that.
[01:04:03.344 --> 01:04:06.946]  We're talking about the deal on who owns the land.
[01:04:06.946 --> 01:04:16.528]  And say, for instance, if I used to be a Baptist and I converted to Catholicism, does that give me the right to move to the Vatican because I'm a Catholic and say that I'm living there?
[01:04:16.528 --> 01:04:24.791]  How is it that these people come out here and say that they're God's chosen people and God gave them the land when they are not descendants of the Israelites?
[01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:25.491]  They converted
[01:04:25.991 --> 01:04:30.500]  The Judaism between the 8th and the 10th century and it gives them absolutely no right
[01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:45.694]  No, no, listen, I'm familiar with that and then the Israelis blew up the British installations to run them out.
[01:04:45.694 --> 01:04:50.335]  I mean, that's the Ergon, you know, the daddy and granddaddy of the White House Chief of Staff.
[01:04:50.335 --> 01:04:51.516]  I understand all that.
[01:04:51.516 --> 01:04:57.617]  My issue is they got 400 nukes, they're not going anywhere, and I want to stop my property taxes going up.
[01:04:57.617 --> 01:04:59.238]  But all we can talk about is Jews all day.
[01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:04.234]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:10.639]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:05:10.639 --> 01:05:18.025]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:18.025 --> 01:05:22.909]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:05:27.853 --> 01:05:31.595]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:33.897]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:34.217]  Call us!

[01:05:52.567 --> 01:05:52.847]  Thank you!
[01:05:52.847 --> 01:05:58.068]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:06:03.931 --> 01:06:05.192]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.192 --> 01:06:08.935]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:08.935 --> 01:06:11.357]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:11.357 --> 01:06:17.223]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:23.449]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:23.889 --> 01:06:29.834]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:29.834 --> 01:06:34.037]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.037 --> 01:06:38.321]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:38.321 --> 01:06:44.286]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:44.286 --> 01:06:47.849]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:47.849 --> 01:06:49.810]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:50.251]  It's here.

[01:07:06.634 --> 01:07:11.776]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:11.776 --> 01:07:18.457]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:20.509 --> 01:07:26.859]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:07:38.652 --> 01:07:40.813]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:07:40.813 --> 01:07:42.594]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:07:42.594 --> 01:07:45.475]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:07:45.475 --> 01:07:49.717]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:07:54.819 --> 01:07:56.400]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.180]  Got it.
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.041]  Others don't.
[01:08:00.902 --> 01:08:03.644]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.644 --> 01:08:13.471]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.471 --> 01:08:14.993]  Alright, welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:14.993 --> 01:08:18.375]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:21.718]  Blondie, Cory, Frank, Sonny, and others.
[01:08:21.718 --> 01:08:27.022]  We've got reporters popping in later in the hour from Bilderberg in Spain.
[01:08:28.584 --> 01:08:28.884]  I think so.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.702]  Davos are now the things that they say on C-SPAN.
[01:08:50.702 --> 01:08:52.683]  They are out in the open.
[01:08:52.683 --> 01:09:03.588]  Because as Brzezinski said, and I saw them change two years ago, I said they now know they're public, they now know we've exposed them, they understand that lying about world government, denying world government,
[01:09:06.536 --> 01:09:13.621]  Has basically backfired on them because everybody's gotten their own documents and knows there is a world government forming.
[01:09:13.621 --> 01:09:18.504]  And so now they've shifted gears to go, OK, we're setting up a world government, but it's a good thing.
[01:09:18.504 --> 01:09:23.907]  But listen, my issue on taxes, the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:09:23.907 --> 01:09:29.031]  And literally hundreds of new taxes are being passed by counties, cities and states and the federal government.
[01:09:29.847 --> 01:09:38.772]  I saw an article a few months ago where 80 plus taxes have been passed and a bunch of others pending in the state of New York alone.
[01:09:38.772 --> 01:09:41.793]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:09:41.793 --> 01:09:50.538]  And so whoever runs the new world order, whatever power structure it is, whoever captains it, and we study that, we cover that.
[01:09:50.538 --> 01:09:51.838]  It's the old nobility of Europe.
[01:09:51.838 --> 01:09:54.980]  It's all these inbred families.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.722]  Regardless, we need to block them and their illegitimate world government takeover.
[01:10:00.148 --> 01:10:02.750]  They want to bankrupt us in their own statements.
[01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.352]  They want to bankrupt us.
[01:10:04.352 --> 01:10:09.817]  They want to take control of our society and they're openly gearing up to shut down our free speech.
[01:10:09.817 --> 01:10:11.779]  It's already started in France.
[01:10:11.779 --> 01:10:12.880]  It's already started in Italy.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.941]  It's already starting in Australia.
[01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:17.524]  They're pushing it now in England and the United States and Canada.
[01:10:17.524 --> 01:10:19.386]  This is going on!
[01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:20.307]  This is tyranny!
[01:10:20.307 --> 01:10:21.949]  We know what this is!
[01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:35.378]  And I'm here to not have a click radio show, not a click of cult of personality Alex Jones, not a click of the Catholics are evil and run it all, or the Jews are evil and run it all.
[01:10:35.378 --> 01:10:38.059]  And you're welcome to call in and talk about whatever you want.
[01:10:38.059 --> 01:10:45.884]  I have my view that I'm not going to get into all these niches and clubs and, no, it's the Reptoids, they run it all, and Alex, you're a Reptoid.
[01:10:45.884 --> 01:10:48.386]  You know, I stick to the facts and one I can prove.
[01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:58.356]  And that's why we are the most listened to alternative radio show in the world, the most viewed alternative websites, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:58.356 --> 01:11:04.442]  That's why my films are the most virally viewed online, is because we stick to the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:04.442 --> 01:11:05.083]  We lay it out.
[01:11:05.984 --> 01:11:14.908]  We lay out the globalist agenda and try to get the people to block it, without getting into balkanization and division, which is how the New World Order controls us.
[01:11:14.908 --> 01:11:23.672]  Look, 99.9% of the world population, whether you're Chinese, whether you're Germanic, whether you're Jewish, whether you're Latin American, Hispanic,
[01:11:24.472 --> 01:11:33.254]  Whether you're African, 99.99% of us are getting the short end of the stick, are being enslaved, are losing our freedoms.
[01:11:33.254 --> 01:11:38.515]  The New World Order is not good for us.
[01:11:38.515 --> 01:11:40.256]  And I am here opposing it.
[01:11:40.256 --> 01:11:42.916]  Who can be against that?
[01:11:42.916 --> 01:11:48.097]  And I know the COINTELPRO has always come at us through these different niche organizations.
[01:11:48.097 --> 01:11:50.558]  How many white supremacist leaders have I told you were feds?
[01:11:51.428 --> 01:12:09.143]  Always with the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, manipulating them, controlling them, FBI, trying to maintain control over the Patriot movement, trying to paint it as racist so that it isn't palatable to the general public, so people go with the establishment.
[01:12:09.143 --> 01:12:09.843]  What do they say?
[01:12:09.843 --> 01:12:11.825]  You're against health care, you're a racist.
[01:12:11.825 --> 01:12:14.908]  You like Rand Paul and smaller government, you're a racist.
[01:12:14.908 --> 01:12:16.009]  They need that.
[01:12:18.581 --> 01:12:26.853]  That's why the Southern Poverty Law Center got caught running the Elohim City white supremacist compound with McVeigh and Andreas Strassmayer, the German intelligence officer.
[01:12:26.853 --> 01:12:34.325]  That's why the major newspapers in Germany report that the modern Nazi movement is run by the government and founded by them.
[01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:40.252]  So they can point to them as an excuse to take other people's free speech.
[01:12:40.252 --> 01:12:42.292]  I understand the full paradigm.
[01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:43.793]  I know the game plan.
[01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:44.893]  I understand it.
[01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:46.754]  And I stand against it.
[01:12:46.754 --> 01:12:48.755]  One hundred and ten percent.
[01:12:48.755 --> 01:12:49.855]  Against the New World Order.
[01:12:49.855 --> 01:12:51.716]  And that's why we're effective.
[01:12:51.716 --> 01:12:53.836]  And that's why we're loved more than anybody.
[01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:54.957]  And we're hated more than anybody.
[01:12:55.976 --> 01:13:02.638]  And God has promised that no weapon formed against us shall prosper as long as we have faith and do the right thing and are honorable.
[01:13:02.638 --> 01:13:10.381]  And so all the attacks, all the lies, all the disinfo only energizes the work we do here on this broadcast.
[01:13:11.301 --> 01:13:13.023]  It only promotes us.
[01:13:13.023 --> 01:13:27.018]  All the lies, all the disinfo, all the deception, all the twisting, all the prevarication, all of it only sends people to this radio show and to my websites and my films and the work we've done and my book and the books I've published
[01:13:27.518 --> 01:13:30.541]  Because people say, I want to check into this Alex Jones.
[01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:38.628]  In this sea of media and alternative ideas and mainstream ideas, we stand out and we stand out more and more.
[01:13:38.628 --> 01:13:41.951]  And I want to commend all of you that have spread the word about this broadcast.
[01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:50.680]  I want to commend all of you out there that are continuing to spread the word about the internet feeds, the streams, the local AM and FM's we're on, the global shortwave, the satellite.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.022]  Thank God you're out there, we're having a huge effect.
[01:13:55.154 --> 01:14:03.762]  I want to continue with your calls, but I want to get to some good news first before I go to Blondie, Cory, Frank, Sonny, and others.
[01:14:03.762 --> 01:14:06.705]  Anti-incumbency takes down another congressman.
[01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:21.918]  Montgomery, Alabama, the political shooting star, otherwise known as anti-incumbency, fell on Alabama, taking down a first-term congressman who switched from Democrat to Republican just last year.
[01:14:21.918 --> 01:14:25.080]  The hotly contested healthcare overhaul was among the issues
[01:14:26.226 --> 01:14:29.327]  Working against Representative Parker Griffith.
[01:14:29.327 --> 01:14:35.910]  Voted out by Republicans Tuesday in the 5th Congressional District in favor of Madison County Commissioner Mo Brooks.
[01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:39.651]  The Tea Party support and the backing of local GOP leaders.
[01:14:39.651 --> 01:14:42.772]  Still bitter about losing to Griffith in 08.
[01:14:42.772 --> 01:14:49.675]  Brooks won Tuesday's primary with slightly more than 50% of the vote in a three candidate field.
[01:14:49.675 --> 01:14:51.896]  Yeah, the establishment always runs an extra to sabotage it.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:15:09.927]  Griffith's ouster came on a day when Representative Arthur Davis lost his bid to become Alabama's first black governor in the state's Democratic primary, and New Mexico's gubernatorial primary set up a general election to debate who becomes the first female governor.
[01:15:09.927 --> 01:15:16.930]  Griffith's loss was the latest manifestation of an anti-establishment, anti-Washington, anti-incumbency fervor.
[01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:19.011]  A 2010 political phenomenon.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:28.908]  That has shaken the Democratic establishment and the Obama White House, and has also caused angst in GOP leadership circles.
[01:15:28.908 --> 01:15:29.909]  That's right, they're scared.
[01:15:29.909 --> 01:15:34.994]  They had Dick Cheney campaign and speak out against Rand Paul.
[01:15:34.994 --> 01:15:42.061]  They had all the big neocons speak out against him, all the Israeli lobby people speak out against him, because he wants to cut off aid to Israel and everybody else, by the way.
[01:15:42.947 --> 01:15:43.707]  They cut it all off!
[01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:44.308]  We're bankrupt!
[01:15:44.308 --> 01:15:45.068]  It's over!
[01:15:45.068 --> 01:15:47.029]  No more welfare-free legal aliens!
[01:15:47.029 --> 01:15:48.190]  No more aid to Egypt!
[01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:49.410]  No more aid to South Korea!
[01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:50.711]  No more aid to Israel!
[01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:52.051]  No more aid to Germany!
[01:15:52.051 --> 01:15:53.152]  No more!
[01:15:53.152 --> 01:15:54.072]  It's over!
[01:15:54.072 --> 01:15:55.293]  We're done paying!
[01:15:55.293 --> 01:15:56.013]  We're bankrupt!
[01:15:56.013 --> 01:15:57.334]  Which the bankers wanted to do.
[01:15:57.334 --> 01:15:59.675]  It's done!
[01:15:59.675 --> 01:16:05.098]  So you got the neocons all piling in, you got the Democrats piling in, you got them basically claiming he's the second coming of Adolf Hitler.
[01:16:06.158 --> 01:16:12.703]  He never talked about the Civil Rights Act, never made it a campaign issue, never called for its repeal, was asked about it.
[01:16:12.703 --> 01:16:14.664]  The globalists knew he would give a standard libertarian answer.
[01:16:14.664 --> 01:16:20.469]  Well, I think it's good, but gone too far, dealing with, you know, private clubs.
[01:16:20.469 --> 01:16:23.411]  But, again, that doesn't matter.
[01:16:23.411 --> 01:16:24.412]  Guess what happened?
[01:16:24.412 --> 01:16:27.354]  I happen to have the polls right here in my hot little hand.
[01:16:32.116 --> 01:16:37.143]  Rand Paul survived smear campaign to maintain healthy lead over Conway.
[01:16:37.143 --> 01:16:48.258]  That was an article that Watson wrote three days ago at PrisonPlanet.com and he gives all the different poll numbers showing him keeping his lead or gaining two points or losing one point in one poll.
[01:16:49.301 --> 01:16:53.185]  Now, overall again, a new poll.
[01:16:53.185 --> 01:16:57.089]  Rand Paul extends lead over Conway despite racist smear.
[01:16:57.089 --> 01:17:00.112]  And it goes through several polls, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:17:00.112 --> 01:17:11.604]  Latest figures show anti-establishment candidate has recovered from coordinated media attack, making those who declared controversy to be end of Paul's political career look foolish.
[01:17:11.604 --> 01:17:11.785]  Yeah.
[01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:38.177]  All the major respected polls, like Angus and Reed, Mason Dixon, and several others, Gallup, let me read here, what's one of the other ones, Rasmussen, show that he gained between four and six points, from 20 points to 26, that's nice if you can get it.
[01:17:38.177 --> 01:17:39.998]  And then the fake Daily Kos poll,
[01:17:41.605 --> 01:17:44.423]  uh... shows that he's gained as well
[01:17:46.769 --> 01:17:49.410]  Of course, you know, they claim that he dropped from 20 points to 6 points.
[01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:51.812]  Well, now he's grown from 6 in their fake poll.
[01:17:51.812 --> 01:17:55.494]  You know, his 6-point lead has grown even in their fake poll.
[01:17:55.494 --> 01:17:56.354]  So what does that tell you?
[01:17:56.354 --> 01:18:03.498]  It's the same thing I told Politico the day after he won, the day before the launch, the attack campaign began.
[01:18:03.498 --> 01:18:08.881]  I said, you know, in the article, I told the reporter, I said, I know the media is going to attack Rand Paul now.
[01:18:08.881 --> 01:18:11.443]  And I said, let me give you some advice, sarcastically.
[01:18:11.443 --> 01:18:13.084]  I said, come out and endorse him.
[01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:19.413]  Oh, if the mainstream media endorsed Rand Paul, he would lose support.
[01:18:19.413 --> 01:18:20.254]  Literally.
[01:18:20.254 --> 01:18:23.255]  But I said, you can't do that because you're egomaniacs.
[01:18:23.255 --> 01:18:25.737]  You believe you've got bullets in your gun.
[01:18:25.737 --> 01:18:27.058]  You're out of bullets.
[01:18:27.058 --> 01:18:33.901]  And I told the reporter, I said, and it's on record, I said, your attacks on him that are coming are only going to bolster him.
[01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:36.723]  What happened?
[01:18:36.723 --> 01:18:38.704]  It bolstered him.
[01:18:38.704 --> 01:18:40.685]  It made him go up in the polls.
[01:18:40.685 --> 01:18:41.006]  That's
[01:18:42.065 --> 01:18:53.187]  I mean, this MSNBC piece coming out against me and Rand Paul for the, what is it, the 14th that they're airing now, or is it the 16th?
[01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:54.448]  I forget.
[01:18:54.448 --> 01:18:55.188]  Look it up for me.
[01:18:55.188 --> 01:18:59.629]  The Rise of the Right, they're going to air it reportedly more than 20 times.
[01:18:59.629 --> 01:19:02.869]  It's a special report that they'll air over and over again.
[01:19:02.869 --> 01:19:09.111]  The last one was the death of Ted Kennedy that Matthews, he does like one a year usually.
[01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:10.991]  And it's a big hit piece.
[01:19:12.852 --> 01:19:19.094]  And in the TV ads, they try to make me look like a kook, they try to make Rand Paul look like a kook, they try to make soccer moms look like kooks.
[01:19:19.094 --> 01:19:22.396]  Hey folks, you're the kooks, okay?
[01:19:22.396 --> 01:19:26.657]  The 16th, thank you, of this month, so 13 days from now.
[01:19:26.657 --> 01:19:28.898]  You are the kooks.
[01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:34.640]  Look, when you get up there and say if someone doesn't want government-run healthcare, that they're racist, you lost all credibility, okay?
[01:19:36.195 --> 01:19:39.616]  So that's why I let Nightline come down here and interview me.
[01:19:39.616 --> 01:19:41.197]  That's why I let CNN interview me.
[01:19:41.197 --> 01:19:43.557]  That's why I let them interview me.
[01:19:43.557 --> 01:19:46.839]  Because you don't have any credibility, Jack!
[01:19:46.839 --> 01:19:47.319]  You understand?
[01:19:47.319 --> 01:19:49.640]  People know that you're not just liberals.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.781]  No, you're fake liberals working for General Electric that makes cluster bombs.
[01:19:54.781 --> 01:19:59.583]  You're a sick, disgusting, filthy, wart-covered fraud!
[01:20:00.792 --> 01:20:06.137]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:20:06.137 --> 01:20:08.880]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.364]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:20:14.255 --> 01:20:18.738]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:22:00.387 --> 01:22:10.414]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:10.414 --> 01:22:16.859]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:16.859 --> 01:22:25.685]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.065 --> 01:22:35.248]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.248 --> 01:22:40.250]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:41.650]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:44.151]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.990]  The problem.
[01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:04.573]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:23:04.573 --> 01:23:07.275]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:23:07.275 --> 01:23:09.958]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:23:09.958 --> 01:23:12.461]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:20.429]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from

[01:24:24.195 --> 01:24:42.572]  So how exciting is this that in Utah, in Kentucky, in Colorado, in Hawaii, in Alabama, in Pennsylvania, in New York, everywhere, Democrat establishment people like Specter are being thrown out?
[01:24:43.726 --> 01:24:53.410]  Establishment Republicans are being thrown out and the AP, here we are a year and a half later, finally admits this is scaring the Republican Party as well.
[01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:56.811]  And again, I called it because I understand how they try to keep us in that left-right paradigm.
[01:24:56.811 --> 01:25:02.774]  A year and a half ago, remember how I noticed that at Tea Parties, the Republicans were trying to take them over.
[01:25:02.774 --> 01:25:07.156]  They'd have Senator Cornyn, they'd have Rick Perry come up to the to the dais.
[01:25:07.896 --> 01:25:09.817]  at the rallies and they would be booed off stage.
[01:25:09.817 --> 01:25:12.659]  And suddenly Perry went, I'm for secession!
[01:25:12.659 --> 01:25:23.527]  He started literally acting like Yosemite Sam in photo shoots and in video interviews going, I'll kill all you rascally rabbit!
[01:25:23.527 --> 01:25:26.569]  I shot a coyote in Austin when I was out in the woods!
[01:25:26.569 --> 01:25:27.829]  He actually said that.
[01:25:27.829 --> 01:25:29.450]  Sort of talking like Yosemite Sam.
[01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:32.032]  And some Texans went, you want to secede?
[01:25:32.032 --> 01:25:33.793]  You don't like a new world order?
[01:25:33.793 --> 01:25:35.835]  Meanwhile, he's going to Bilderberg group meetings.
[01:25:35.835 --> 01:25:36.555]  I like Perry!
[01:25:37.996 --> 01:25:44.908]  You know and you know you're somebody saying I'm actually lifting himself off the off the ground like jetpacks with his 45s elevating so
[01:25:52.242 --> 01:26:08.116]  He's the only one that survived because he knew how to, a year ago, almost a year and a half ago, when he got booed, he went from, you know, having that establishment accent and sounding like an establishment person to just like, I'll get rid of them toll roads!
[01:26:08.116 --> 01:26:09.918]  I'll get rid of them Millerburg!
[01:26:09.918 --> 01:26:15.403]  I tell you, I'm downright angry!
[01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:19.046]  Everybody else is going down in flames.
[01:26:22.228 --> 01:26:33.054]  Everyone, everyone else, every incumbent at a national level for the Congress, for the House or Senate, is terminated, is gone.
[01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:38.738]  What does that tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the system is in deep trouble?
[01:26:38.738 --> 01:26:47.023]  And day one, so everybody can learn their tricks, I learned this, most of you understand it, but for laymen out there that are just not tuning in, Republicans were being booed everywhere.
[01:26:48.075 --> 01:26:58.137]  And the media, MSNBC, came out and said it is racist, the Tea Parties are racist, and it's Republican-run by Republican Party lobbyists.
[01:26:58.137 --> 01:26:59.518]  Totally false.
[01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:01.398]  But that became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:27:01.398 --> 01:27:04.439]  They knew what was going to happen.
[01:27:04.439 --> 01:27:05.799]  They rushed in.
[01:27:05.799 --> 01:27:11.380]  The Republicans created all their fake Tea Party groups, tried to take control of it, but they haven't been totally successful.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:12.041]  I'd say 35-40% successful.
[01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:18.457]  They were successful in fooling liberals to think, oh, I can't be part of the Tea Party.
[01:27:18.457 --> 01:27:20.178]  It's a right-wing thing.
[01:27:20.178 --> 01:27:22.139]  It's an anti-black thing.
[01:27:22.139 --> 01:27:23.820]  And then everybody's paranoid of each other.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.161]  So they've been somewhat successful keeping us divided.
[01:27:26.161 --> 01:27:27.882]  But overall, incumbents are out.
[01:27:27.882 --> 01:27:33.004]  Democrats in Democrat districts are voting incumbent Democrats out, establishment Democrats out.
[01:27:33.004 --> 01:27:36.086]  In Republican districts, they're voting establishment Republicans out.
[01:27:36.086 --> 01:27:44.010]  In every single case, unless you talk bad about the New World Order and act like you're Yosemite Sam, you are an
[01:27:46.611 --> 01:27:53.313]  And by the way, when Perry continues all his treason, he's going to get in trouble.
[01:27:53.313 --> 01:28:06.797]  So this is very, very, very exciting and overall the media, Republican and Democrat controlled media, Fox News, MSNBC, all of them, they're trying to keep it still on the Republican Democrat reservation.
[01:28:06.797 --> 01:28:08.978]  They're trying to keep your choices within that paradigm.
[01:28:10.902 --> 01:28:14.845]  And they've done everything they can to be like, oh, the Tea Party is a conservative thing.
[01:28:14.845 --> 01:28:17.287]  The Tea Party is an anti-Democrat thing.
[01:28:17.287 --> 01:28:21.251]  Oh, the Tea Party, it's gonna really get those Democrats.
[01:28:21.251 --> 01:28:22.952]  It's gonna get those Republicans, too.
[01:28:22.952 --> 01:28:26.595]  What have I been saying for a year and a half?
[01:28:26.595 --> 01:28:29.878]  Since Obama got into office.
[01:28:29.878 --> 01:28:39.726]  And now we see it clear as day, and the entire system is panicking in a big, big way today.
[01:28:42.486 --> 01:28:43.866]  This is so exciting.
[01:28:43.866 --> 01:28:46.387]  Blondie in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:55.750]  Hi Alex, I'm glad you've been reiterating that a robber must be confronted with necessary and if, well, if necessary deadly force if they break into your home.
[01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:59.811]  Now in reference to your video yesterday on InfoWars.com, the two minute one,
[01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:04.550]  Uh, that highlighted the weapons, uh, that were held by members of a boat crew.
[01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:13.459]  Does this mean that if Israeli commandos storm a flag vessel in international waters, the crew can't use stun grenades, sticks, or kitchen knives to defend themselves?
[01:29:13.459 --> 01:29:18.104]  Because you never brought this up with Corey Gould, and it makes it sound like you're flip-flopping on self-defense.
[01:29:19.022 --> 01:29:20.883]  No, I'm not flip-flopping on self-defense.
[01:29:20.883 --> 01:29:26.386]  I'm just bringing in different perspectives, trying to be balanced, because there have been claims that no one even fought back.
[01:29:26.386 --> 01:29:30.529]  And I've stated that I believe it's illegal to attack the ship in international waters.
[01:29:30.529 --> 01:29:37.253]  But the thing is, I'm not... I'm not hoping Turkey goes and gets in a war with Israel when this next group of ships comes in.
[01:29:37.253 --> 01:29:42.836]  I hope Israel lets the ships dock, and I hope that there isn't conflict.
[01:29:42.836 --> 01:29:46.999]  Okay, you also stated that the flotilla may have been a staged event to draw Israeli response.
[01:29:47.759 --> 01:29:48.900]  Uh, do you still agree with that?
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.822]  Well, stay there!
[01:29:50.822 --> 01:29:52.223]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.223 --> 01:29:54.745]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:03.511]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.511 --> 01:31:08.833]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:08.833 --> 01:31:10.874]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:10.874 --> 01:31:15.877]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:15.877 --> 01:31:17.058]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.058 --> 01:31:17.798]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.178 --> 01:31:20.059]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.059 --> 01:31:21.139]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.139 --> 01:31:23.340]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:24.681]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:24.681 --> 01:31:26.201]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.201 --> 01:31:31.483]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.483 --> 01:31:35.065]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.065 --> 01:31:38.526]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:38.886 --> 01:31:40.106]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.106 --> 01:31:41.007]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.007 --> 01:31:42.107]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.107 --> 01:31:43.027]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.027 --> 01:31:44.128]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.128 --> 01:31:47.188]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.188 --> 01:31:50.309]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:50.309 --> 01:31:51.230]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:59.537 --> 01:32:00.839]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:00.839 --> 01:32:06.446]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:06.446 --> 01:32:11.453]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:11.453 --> 01:32:16.499]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:22.242]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:22.242 --> 01:32:24.563]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:32:24.563 --> 01:32:29.365]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:29.365 --> 01:32:30.485]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:30.485 --> 01:32:33.547]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:36.828]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:37.148 --> 01:32:40.351]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:40.351 --> 01:32:42.573]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:42.573 --> 01:32:43.514]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:43.514 --> 01:32:43.914]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:43.914 --> 01:32:47.157]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:47.157 --> 01:32:48.919]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:12.598 --> 01:33:26.621]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Mark Anderson, deputy editor of American Free Press, the national weekly newspaper, is our guest joining us from Spain, from the town where they're having Milderberg 2010.
[01:33:26.621 --> 01:33:33.302]  And we're also getting Jim Tucker lined up on the line as well right now.
[01:33:33.302 --> 01:33:37.102]  Now, it officially kicked off today, but they shut the hotel down yesterday.
[01:33:37.102 --> 01:33:39.203]  We had London Guardian reporter Ron Charlie
[01:33:40.223 --> 01:33:41.044]  My pleasure.
[01:33:41.044 --> 01:33:43.725]  We've been inundated with local media and state media requests.
[01:33:43.725 --> 01:33:44.726]  It's been a very interesting day.
[01:34:02.594 --> 01:34:22.890]  Yeah, I mean, we've gone from 33 years ago or so, when the media would say that Jim was a kook and Bilderberg didn't exist, you know, the real trailblazer on this, to now, the Drudge Report, the Times of London, secret of Bilderberg Club, ready for protest, and they admit they're pushing for world government there in Sigis, Spain.
[01:34:23.959 --> 01:34:26.723]  Yeah, that's part and parcel of what's going on here.
[01:34:26.723 --> 01:34:31.851]  Lots of national and regional media interest, conventional corporate media as well.
[01:34:31.851 --> 01:34:37.620]  The secrecy is being stripped away, but their drive and their ambitions are a hard thing to satisfy.
[01:34:38.933 --> 01:34:43.135]  Well, I saw you interviewed by Russia Today on the ground with some of the protesters there.
[01:34:43.135 --> 01:34:44.856]  I saw the police shoving protesters.
[01:34:44.856 --> 01:34:51.799]  I even saw some of the protesters shoving the police back, and the police didn't attack them, so it looked like the police aren't wanting a confrontation.
[01:34:51.799 --> 01:35:01.143]  Normally, police would go haywire if somebody, you know, shoved them back, but, you know, because they're used to people submitting to their godlike authority to assault them, but not to be assaulted back.
[01:35:01.143 --> 01:35:08.246]  Break down the type of security you're seeing and expanding on that, any intel you're getting from inside the hotel.
[01:35:09.215 --> 01:35:20.181]  The security, after I was at Hotel Dulce on June 1st, began to show up as the local police on June 2nd, and it intensified with these paddy wagons.
[01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:27.965]  They have mobile detention vans that the police can ride in themselves, but if they had to detain someone, they can do it on the spot.
[01:35:28.725 --> 01:35:48.523]  Oh, and I've been told by reliable sources that the plane close to private security are beginning to filter in, but what I've seen and what you saw on the Russia program was local police clearing one of those roundabouts, those round turnaround areas common in Europe, and they had to clear the grass area in the middle of that.
[01:35:49.023 --> 01:35:59.052]  So, protesters and activists and journalists could not clearly see or as clearly see or photograph any dark tinted window cars going in.
[01:35:59.052 --> 01:36:02.535]  It was just to kind of limit visibility and marginalize everyone.
[01:36:02.535 --> 01:36:08.521]  The pushing and shoving was a lot of local activists that just said, keep your hands off me, keep your hands off me.
[01:36:08.521 --> 01:36:11.323]  But so far, the police have showed a lot of restraint.
[01:36:11.323 --> 01:36:13.986]  In terms of what's going on information-wise,
[01:36:14.686 --> 01:36:26.497]  I know the broad brush strokes that they have been looking at making the IMF into a real treasury and things like that, but the minutiae, the detail, we're still working on and Jim can probably address that a little more.
[01:36:27.438 --> 01:36:31.743]  Yeah, and I know Jim is trying to make his way up to his hotel room being mobbed by media.
[01:36:31.743 --> 01:36:37.370]  This is the complete opposite of even what was happening ten years ago with almost no mainstream media coverage.
[01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:44.780]  We know this has got to be upsetting these world government schemers that they can't have their little mafia commission meetings in secret anymore.
[01:36:45.718 --> 01:36:46.919]  Oh, I think it is.
[01:36:46.919 --> 01:37:01.308]  And the more this is done, the more they're going to get the pie in the face, so to speak, for people knowing they're meeting, and yet no forthcoming press releases, no, you know, openness or transparency, no lists or anything of names.
[01:37:01.308 --> 01:37:03.689]  They're their dishonor roll, I call it.
[01:37:03.689 --> 01:37:07.311]  And it's, you know, at some point something's got to give.
[01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:11.594]  With the Greek economy having taken a dive since last year's Bilderberg meeting in Greece,
[01:37:12.074 --> 01:37:14.155]  I think the Spanish see the writing on the wall.
[01:37:14.155 --> 01:37:20.799]  And there's a lot of Spanish people, bartenders, shopkeepers, have told me that they see their economy going the same way.
[01:37:20.799 --> 01:37:25.862]  And, you know, as night follows day, the Bilderberg machinations, the fingerprints are all over this thing.
[01:37:30.697 --> 01:37:34.961]  Now I know you and Jim have been running around throughout the city trying to reach contacts.
[01:37:34.961 --> 01:37:38.505]  Jim got there a day late because of his plane being delayed.
[01:37:38.505 --> 01:37:41.007]  Normally he goes into the hotel before it gets shut down.
[01:37:41.007 --> 01:37:42.589]  I've been there with him before.
[01:37:42.589 --> 01:37:47.173]  This has been done in Canada and of course in Virginia.
[01:37:47.173 --> 01:37:49.936]  But tell us about some of the sleuth work you've been doing.
[01:37:50.723 --> 01:37:58.305]  Well, without going into too much detail, to tip my hand too much, just generally trying to learn the ropes.
[01:37:58.305 --> 01:38:03.386]  I'm a newcomer to Bilderberg, not in writing and reading about it, but in actually attending one.
[01:38:03.386 --> 01:38:06.806]  I guess you could call me Jim's apprentice in a way.
[01:38:06.806 --> 01:38:18.909]  This is a very complicated affair when you're dealing with so many important people lodged into one spot, and you're trying to get information that you can consider reliable, not just information or rumors.
[01:38:19.929 --> 01:38:23.411]  A big thing has been to wake the town and tell the people.
[01:38:23.411 --> 01:38:25.332]  Kind of the Z of Zorro on the wall.
[01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:31.795]  A lot of flyers have been circulating, written in Spanish, telling the average Spanish person what's going on in their town.
[01:38:31.795 --> 01:38:43.620]  And I produced some of those and they went pretty viral at a lot of the protests at a train station and at different spots around Sitges, which is sort of an outreach of Barcelona, Spain, here along the Mediterranean.
[01:38:45.701 --> 01:38:46.743]  We're good to go.
[01:39:01.659 --> 01:39:07.861]  Hardly anyone there already, and they had that place vacuumed as clean as clean can get.
[01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:17.143]  And without going into too much detail, there just wasn't any sign yet of information or people for the actual Bilderberg meeting.
[01:39:17.143 --> 01:39:20.824]  But there was a very distinct lack of customers.
[01:39:20.824 --> 01:39:24.345]  And of course I inquired, can I get a hotel room here in a couple of nights?
[01:39:24.345 --> 01:39:26.665]  And they said, no, there's a big convention.
[01:39:26.665 --> 01:39:27.506]  You cannot be here.
[01:39:30.058 --> 01:39:33.560]  I was just playing with them a little bit.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:45.548]  There's a lot of ironies and intrigue going on, but the media coverage from all levels, both independent and regular media, is really quite intense.
[01:39:45.548 --> 01:39:50.931]  A lot of TV crews have been there all day, yesterday and all day, or part of the day, the day before.
[01:39:52.108 --> 01:39:54.289]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:39:54.289 --> 01:40:01.014]  What type of... What's the flavor of the reporting that's going on that you're seeing on television and the press?
[01:40:01.014 --> 01:40:03.776]  Or are you unable to read it because you don't speak Spanish?
[01:40:03.776 --> 01:40:05.677]  I mean, I know I don't.
[01:40:05.677 --> 01:40:09.520]  Well, you know, it's not so much the language barrier, though that plays a role.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:15.664]  It's that I'm so busy doing this, what I do, that I don't have time to see the results of what they do, let alone
[01:40:16.444 --> 01:40:18.506]  No it did, it's mainly about the security.
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:45.388]  Yeah, so it's tricky, it's hard to even, sometimes the reporters that you talk to don't provide all the information on what stations they broadcast on, how to dial it in.
[01:40:45.388 --> 01:40:48.290]  But the point is there's a lot of media there, so that's exciting.
[01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:57.077]  It's been almost constant, and it's a great mixture of the independent bloggers right on up to your national and regional TV stations.
[01:40:57.077 --> 01:41:02.461]  I heard one lady reporter with a national Spanish station arguing with her editor or her boss
[01:41:03.202 --> 01:41:08.780]  Uh, saying we do too much trivia, too much bubblegum, we need to do more with this, which is, you know, a good thing to hear.
[01:41:09.881 --> 01:41:18.027]  Well, I was talking to Charlie Skelton yesterday from The Guardian, and he said he was talking to BBC TV.
[01:41:18.027 --> 01:41:26.513]  They were getting ready to run with it, and then later the editor said, look, this has been killed, or the producer he was talking to said, this story's now been killed.
[01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:35.159]  So we do see Bilderberg there, you know, trying to suppress the news, trying to keep real news from hitting the media, but they're having less and less control.
[01:41:35.159 --> 01:41:38.422]  Let me ask you this, Mr. Anderson from American Free Press, Deputy Editor.
[01:41:40.074 --> 01:41:49.806]  Did you see Zbigniew Brzezinski's speech of two weeks ago that we wrote about and was later picked up and used in a speech before the EU Parliament a few days ago?
[01:41:49.806 --> 01:41:58.297]  Quotes from our article dealing with the fact that Brzezinski basically said, for the first time in history the whole world is awake to our world government and things are getting tougher for us.
[01:41:59.139 --> 01:42:09.830]  I saw a clip of that that somebody sent me, like an excerpt, and the only thing I would caution, and I think that's true, what he said, is what Taylor Caldwell, the late author, said.
[01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:17.517]  She warned that we shouldn't too easily believe that these power elite have large squabbles among themselves.
[01:42:17.517 --> 01:42:20.721]  They might have minor points of disagreement, but they do tend to think
[01:42:21.381 --> 01:42:24.383]  Pretty much birds of a feather flock together, you know.
[01:42:24.383 --> 01:42:27.485]  And so, some of that could be for public consumption.
[01:42:27.485 --> 01:42:30.486]  You know, like the fun zoo, the art of war.
[01:42:30.486 --> 01:42:32.027]  When you are strong, appear weak.
[01:42:32.027 --> 01:42:34.008]  When you are weak, appear strong.
[01:42:34.008 --> 01:42:43.814]  We have to be very careful, and I've cautioned Jim, and Jim agrees, that what Brzezinski said is probably true, but we don't want them to play possum on us.
[01:42:43.814 --> 01:42:48.417]  We don't want them to put out urban legends that we'll believe too easily.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:54.626]  Yeah, I agree with you, but I'm not a spring chicken in all of this research myself.
[01:42:54.626 --> 01:42:56.488]  Of course not.
[01:42:56.488 --> 01:43:00.071]  And what he said is true, just from my own research.
[01:43:00.071 --> 01:43:01.573]  The awakening is real.
[01:43:01.573 --> 01:43:03.094]  I see it on the streets.
[01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:06.317]  And sure, we don't want to take from this, oh, we've beat them.
[01:43:06.317 --> 01:43:12.524]  No, we are now just finally finding our feet and have gotten a few good blows in, so we're in the fight.
[01:43:13.184 --> 01:43:22.650]  But I mean, I think the victory at Trenton by George Washington against the Hessians, you know, in the middle of the Revolutionary War, I don't think that was them going, God, we've won the war.
[01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:26.113]  I think it was, my God, we're starting to win a few battles here.
[01:43:26.113 --> 01:43:28.614]  And the fact that world government is being set.
[01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:30.396]  I don't know.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:46.583]  Yeah, that's a pretty good analogy, Alex.
[01:43:46.583 --> 01:43:50.869]  Yeah, I think the part that's true is the public awakening.
[01:43:50.869 --> 01:44:03.164]  And that has got to trouble the octogenarian tyrants like David Rockefeller and his apprentices or associates like Zbigniew Brzezinski, trilateral boys.
[01:44:03.964 --> 01:44:14.330]  Um, and it's got to be troubling to them because I think the patriarch Rockefeller wants to see certain things happen before he goes to the great Bilderberg meeting in the sky, you know?
[01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:15.731]  And, excuse me, I'm a little giggly.
[01:44:15.731 --> 01:44:17.372]  I haven't slept hardly.
[01:44:17.372 --> 01:44:21.574]  And, uh, so, you know, at some point they're going to get impatient and, um...
[01:44:22.481 --> 01:44:28.583]  Hopefully there won't be any strange events or big wars or, you know, they always resort to war in the final analysis.
[01:44:28.583 --> 01:44:30.804]  Well, I agree with you and that's the key intel.
[01:44:30.804 --> 01:44:38.727]  We can't wait till Jim's able to talk to some sources, but you can also see the Bilderberg mouthpieces more and more out in the open trying to deal with the 24-hour news cycle.
[01:44:38.727 --> 01:44:51.171]  They're a lot more public, you know, Bilderberg group members in basically pushing the agenda and undoubtedly within days of the meeting ending, we'll see their spin on what their real agenda is.
[01:44:52.171 --> 01:44:56.492]  But certainly they're gearing up to go into Iran, that's back on the front burner.
[01:44:56.492 --> 01:45:01.534]  Certainly they're using this whole Mediterranean thing with Israel as a new way to kick stuff off.
[01:45:01.534 --> 01:45:09.077]  The whole North Korean peninsula, the George Washington mega aircraft carrier going off the coast of North Korea.
[01:45:09.077 --> 01:45:13.198]  I mean, war is their only card right now, or giant false flag terror attack.
[01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:20.102]  That's the downside to the Wonderful Awakening, is that they always, in the end, resort to what you just said.
[01:45:20.102 --> 01:45:29.814]  The only card that they can play without much interference, and that's the War card, and that's, you know, I don't even have to go into why that's bad or how unfortunate that is.
[01:45:30.474 --> 01:45:31.354]  I think so.
[01:45:47.361 --> 01:45:51.583]  They've got a lot of variables, maybe, but in the end, you're right.
[01:45:51.583 --> 01:45:56.425]  War with Iran, as Jim Tucker has reported, has been a major Bilderberg goal.
[01:45:56.425 --> 01:45:59.326]  Perhaps on behalf of Israel, maybe there's an element there.
[01:45:59.326 --> 01:46:09.651]  And then the IMF as a world treasury, perhaps the World Health Organization as a world health department, maybe using some swine flu-like excuse or something.
[01:46:10.211 --> 01:46:15.964]  But at the same time, you know, maybe war gets a little messy for them on occasion.
[01:46:15.964 --> 01:46:17.869]  Maybe they can only fight on so many fronts.
[01:46:18.701 --> 01:46:19.402]  I don't know.
[01:46:40.795 --> 01:46:49.586]  Press release, something, even put on a semblance of openness, although I know it's not real meaningful, but I think we need to force their hand on that.
[01:46:50.199 --> 01:46:51.660]  Well, well said, Mark Anderson.
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:57.002]  I look forward to having you pop back on sometime tomorrow when you've got more intel of what's happening.
[01:46:57.002 --> 01:47:03.405]  We're going to work on getting Jim on coming up in the last hour, about an hour and 15 minutes from now, to get him to pop in.
[01:47:03.405 --> 01:47:07.107]  I know he's got jet lag and is exhausted and trying to make his way up to his room right now.
[01:47:07.107 --> 01:47:10.549]  So I'm going to put you on hold with my producer.
[01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:11.950]  We're good.
[01:47:26.462 --> 01:47:28.944]  Online, it's AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:47:28.944 --> 01:47:31.086]  That's AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:47:31.086 --> 01:47:33.687]  Call 888-699-NEWS.
[01:47:33.687 --> 01:47:41.053]  That's 888-699-NEWS for subscription information or if you want to just get a specific insert or issue.
[01:47:41.053 --> 01:47:48.318]  And then you can get a 16 weeks for $17.76 trial subscription during the holidays.
[01:47:48.318 --> 01:47:50.559]  Sometimes it's 16 weeks for $16.
[01:47:50.559 --> 01:47:51.420]  That's four months.
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:52.541]  I'm good.
[01:48:06.565 --> 01:48:07.106]  Absolutely.
[01:48:07.106 --> 01:48:08.707]  We're going to break here in about two minutes.
[01:48:08.707 --> 01:48:11.769]  I want to speak to you during the break, but I'm going to hand you over to Jaron right now.
[01:48:11.769 --> 01:48:12.990]  We'll talk to you again soon, sir.
[01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.711]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:48:13.711 --> 01:48:14.451]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:48:14.451 --> 01:48:15.252]  Appreciate it.
[01:48:15.252 --> 01:48:15.572]  You bet.
[01:48:15.572 --> 01:48:18.975]  We'll get Mark Anderson on tomorrow or Sunday.
[01:48:18.975 --> 01:48:21.597]  Sunday might be the show, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:48:21.597 --> 01:48:22.838]  Central.
[01:48:22.838 --> 01:48:27.221]  We do shows six days a week here, if you're just tuned in, because so much happens over the weekend.
[01:48:27.221 --> 01:48:31.905]  I do a two-hour, abbreviated broadcast transmission because so much is happening.
[01:48:33.266 --> 01:48:42.633]  Maybe we should work on getting Tucker and Anderson on then as well, because then they'll have all their notes in hindsight and we can get some real intel, because things are just now kicking off.
[01:48:42.633 --> 01:48:53.421]  It starts officially Thursday, some arrive on the Wednesday, and then they have the meeting Thursday evening, Friday, Saturday they play golf generally, and then Sunday they leave.
[01:48:53.421 --> 01:48:56.223]  And we always get valuable info from Tucker.
[01:48:56.943 --> 01:49:02.827]  There's other people go to the meetings and kind of get some good intel, make some stuff up.
[01:49:02.827 --> 01:49:05.709]  But there's other folks that get good information as well.
[01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:10.793]  But more and more, I mean, I'm just calling it like it is.
[01:49:10.793 --> 01:49:18.699]  Bilderberg is more about the spectacle of the elite trying to meet in secret, trying to suppress media coverage.
[01:49:18.699 --> 01:49:20.180]  The world government's now out in the open.
[01:49:21.628 --> 01:49:31.991]  And now, this isn't Jim Tucker 30 plus years ago talking about world government and digging through the trash at Bilderberg and sinking in and getting key info.
[01:49:31.991 --> 01:49:33.091]  And that still happens.
[01:49:33.091 --> 01:49:34.931]  Now it's out in the open.
[01:49:34.931 --> 01:49:39.392]  A global constitution of the private central banks that you will pay carbon taxes to.
[01:49:39.392 --> 01:49:45.654]  And Obama is hell-bent to get this through and he's saying, well, because of the BP spill, he's got to do this now.
[01:49:46.554 --> 01:49:46.894]  I don't know.
[01:50:08.661 --> 01:50:09.603]  We're good to go.
[01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.709]  Yeah.
[01:50:40.425 --> 01:50:42.787]  And that they're not going to give us any quarter.
[01:50:42.787 --> 01:50:48.932]  And it's very important for everyone out there to get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement on DVD.
[01:50:48.932 --> 01:50:57.118]  That's probably overall the most important film I've ever made because it gives you, in two hours and 35 minutes, the entire spectrum of what we're facing.
[01:50:57.118 --> 01:51:00.541]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and a lot more when Viktor Ostrovsky joins us.
[01:51:01.081 --> 01:51:04.082]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:51:04.082 --> 01:51:06.143]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:51:06.143 --> 01:51:08.904]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:51:08.904 --> 01:51:11.125]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:51:11.125 --> 01:51:12.545]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:51:12.545 --> 01:51:14.446]  But first, the facts.
[01:51:14.446 --> 01:51:16.367]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:51:16.367 --> 01:51:18.347]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:51:18.347 --> 01:51:22.049]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:51:22.049 --> 01:51:29.792]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:51:29.792 --> 01:51:30.392]  Sinofresh.

[01:51:51.986 --> 01:51:52.387]  It works!
[01:52:00.748 --> 01:52:02.049]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.049 --> 01:52:07.633]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.633 --> 01:52:12.656]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.656 --> 01:52:18.240]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:22.923]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.442 --> 01:52:30.565]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.565 --> 01:52:31.686]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.686 --> 01:52:38.369]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.369 --> 01:52:41.570]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:44.731]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.731 --> 01:52:44.931]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:53.496 --> 01:52:57.419]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.419 --> 01:53:00.602]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:53:16.934 --> 01:53:21.696]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[01:53:21.696 --> 01:53:25.618]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.

[01:53:37.864 --> 01:53:38.164]  I think so.
[01:54:24.895 --> 01:54:26.717]  Alright, I'm going to go to some of your phone calls.
[01:54:26.717 --> 01:54:31.281]  Corey, Sonny, Bruce, Repatriate Ian in this segment and the next.
[01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:33.503]  And then we've got Victor Ostrowski on.
[01:54:33.503 --> 01:54:36.706]  I had a lot of callers today.
[01:54:36.706 --> 01:54:42.052]  You heard them critical of what I had to say about the flotilla.
[01:54:43.647 --> 01:54:48.128]  And, uh, you know, implying that I was saying people didn't have a right to defend themselves.
[01:54:48.128 --> 01:54:50.909]  Uh, again, more straw man arguments.
[01:54:50.909 --> 01:54:52.630]  Uh, I don't care if people hate me.
[01:54:52.630 --> 01:54:54.230]  I mean, that, that's what folks don't understand.
[01:54:54.230 --> 01:54:56.371]  It doesn't hurt me.
[01:54:56.371 --> 01:54:59.492]  Uh, you know, people make stuff up or exaggerate or build straw men.
[01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:03.433]  Uh, I just feel sorry for people not being honest about what I've said.
[01:55:04.665 --> 01:55:17.194]  I was pointing out that I saw press reports where the people on that ship had claimed that they were fired on first, and now watching the videos, it looks like they were attacking people first.
[01:55:17.194 --> 01:55:20.836]  Now, clearly, the boarding is a form of assault.
[01:55:20.836 --> 01:55:23.758]  And I got a guest coming on who's critical of it.
[01:55:23.758 --> 01:55:25.759]  But, you know, it's so tribal.
[01:55:25.759 --> 01:55:30.162]  It's like you've got to be on the pro-Israel side, or you've got to be on the anti-Israel side.
[01:55:31.483 --> 01:55:32.785]  And I'm rebellious, folks.
[01:55:32.785 --> 01:55:34.347]  I'm not going to be on either side.
[01:55:34.347 --> 01:55:36.309]  I'm here covering the issues.
[01:55:45.467 --> 01:55:49.112]  In my own little way, stop some type of confrontation.
[01:55:49.112 --> 01:55:50.754]  But I'm not out there in the Mediterranean.
[01:55:50.754 --> 01:55:52.255]  I'm not boarding the ship.
[01:55:52.255 --> 01:55:55.499]  And I'm not beating the Israelis with the poles.
[01:55:55.499 --> 01:56:00.966]  I'm here in Texas calling for the Second Amendment and sovereignty and supporting our borders and liberty.
[01:56:03.044 --> 01:56:07.127]  And you know, a lot of what it is, is that people are just jealous of this radio show.
[01:56:07.127 --> 01:56:15.774]  You got a lot of people that are in the alternative media, a lot of people that have websites, blogs, make films, and they think I'm like floating around on cloud nine.
[01:56:15.774 --> 01:56:18.176]  And that I know all these Hollywood people and I'm so cool.
[01:56:18.176 --> 01:56:23.120]  No, what I am is a hard-working person sitting here in a office park in South Austin.
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:30.927]  Uh, who bust my butt, who's going to be working at 10 o'clock tonight in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:56:30.927 --> 01:56:33.390]  And so that's why I've been successful.
[01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:39.656]  And it just frustrates me that so much energy is spent on Alex Jones.
[01:56:39.656 --> 01:56:46.382]  I'd say maybe 20% of internet activity that's anti-New World Order is actually about me, positive and negative.
[01:56:48.404 --> 01:56:49.184]  I've never tried.
[01:56:49.184 --> 01:56:51.085]  I mean, I could start organizations.
[01:56:51.085 --> 01:56:55.888]  I just supported Luke Radowsky and now we are changed as hundreds of chapters everywhere.
[01:56:55.888 --> 01:56:58.950]  I mean, all these tyranny response teams are everywhere.
[01:56:58.950 --> 01:57:02.071]  All these other organizations, we have energized.
[01:57:02.071 --> 01:57:03.712]  My audience is energized.
[01:57:03.712 --> 01:57:07.815]  I could have some big organization and be some big leader and have groups under me.
[01:57:07.815 --> 01:57:08.775]  I don't.
[01:57:08.775 --> 01:57:10.036]  I don't want to be your leader.
[01:57:12.495 --> 01:57:20.961]  If I was an egomaniac, though, I would probably form an organization and really try to reach for a lot of political power.
[01:57:20.961 --> 01:57:23.403]  But that's not even what I want.
[01:57:23.403 --> 01:57:35.232]  I understand the power of getting individuals to take action, of getting individuals to reach out, and getting individuals to expand their paradigms.
[01:57:35.232 --> 01:57:37.193]  That cannot be stopped.
[01:57:37.193 --> 01:57:40.316]  You know, if this is a movement about Alex Jones being the big leader,
[01:57:41.363 --> 01:57:43.225]  Then it can be decapitated.
[01:57:43.225 --> 01:57:47.808]  But if it is an idea, an idea, as V for Vendetta says, is bulletproof.
[01:57:47.808 --> 01:57:52.952]  So we're going to go to break, cram in some calls, and we've got Victor Ostrowski joining us after that.
[01:57:52.952 --> 01:57:57.736]  But I do want to, again, encourage listeners and thank listeners that have supported this broadcast.
[01:57:57.736 --> 01:58:00.959]  You support it by spreading the word about the radio show.
[01:58:00.959 --> 01:58:08.204]  You support it by supporting the sponsors, local AM and FM sponsors, and Genesis sponsors, and our sponsors, our web sponsors.
[01:58:09.185 --> 01:58:13.187]  And you also support us when you buy the books and videos, which are the best out there.
[01:58:13.187 --> 01:58:14.288]  That's just not me saying that.
[01:58:14.288 --> 01:58:20.651]  I mean, that's... You support it by reviewing our films, and calling the talk radio, and talking about my films.
[01:58:20.651 --> 01:58:24.232]  You support it by buying the videos, or by giving us donations.

[01:58:34.183 --> 01:58:35.385]  The haters aren't going to stop us.
[01:58:35.385 --> 01:58:36.686]  Nobody's going to stop us.
[01:58:36.686 --> 01:58:42.153]  If it's God's will, and I believe it's God's will, we succeed together.

[02:00:11.730 --> 02:00:13.270]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:17.472]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.472 --> 02:00:21.514]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.722 --> 02:00:26.504]  Okay, my friends, we are back live, halfway into this transmission.
[02:00:26.504 --> 02:00:37.631]  Victor Ostrowski, former Israeli Navy officer, and of course, Mossad officer as well, is going to be joining us to give us his take on what's happened with Israel and the flotilla.
[02:00:37.631 --> 02:00:39.372]  Now, more ships coming.
[02:00:39.372 --> 02:00:42.854]  And what do you think Israel's going to do with that situation?
[02:00:42.854 --> 02:00:44.235]  What Turkey's going to do?
[02:00:44.235 --> 02:00:45.096]  That's coming up.
[02:00:45.096 --> 02:00:48.158]  Let's go to Corey, Ian, and others right now.
[02:00:48.158 --> 02:00:49.619]  Ian in England, you're on the air.
[02:00:49.619 --> 02:00:49.939]  Welcome.
[02:00:53.578 --> 02:00:54.399]  Hello there.
[02:00:54.399 --> 02:00:55.599]  Yes, yes Ian, go ahead.
[02:00:55.599 --> 02:01:00.123]  Hi, very good to hear from you.
[02:01:00.123 --> 02:01:21.398]  Yeah, I've got, and don't, please don't get upset with what I'm going to ask, but I've been very interested in your following of Machete, the movie that is going out, and I'm just wondering why we can't, I mean, you always say to validate the information, and I've looked everywhere for a copy of the script,
[02:01:22.739 --> 02:01:28.685]  Is there any word that it is, you know, a surreptitious distribution occurred?
[02:01:28.685 --> 02:01:34.271]  Well, to be clear, I was sent the script by an unnamed person involved with the production.
[02:01:34.271 --> 02:01:35.433]  So we're just going to leave that.
[02:01:35.433 --> 02:01:42.100]  I mean, you understand the media has sources and you don't give those sources up or you don't ever get another source again.
[02:01:44.767 --> 02:01:46.487]  Yes, Alex, I totally understand that.
[02:01:46.487 --> 02:02:04.770]  Okay, okay, so, so, and you've seen the trailer for it, and you can read the article two weeks ago, he did an interview, Robert Rodriguez, the filmmaker, with Ain't It Cool News, and he said, I agree, there is some stuff in there that could have caused problems with what's happening in Arizona, and then he's gonna cut it out of the film.
[02:02:04.770 --> 02:02:09.371]  And I shot video of the script with screenshots.
[02:02:09.371 --> 02:02:13.312]  Have you seen the video I put up with video of the pages underlined?
[02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.910]  Absolutely.
[02:02:39.619 --> 02:02:39.979]  Absolutely.
[02:02:39.979 --> 02:02:43.022]  I'm not denying that what you've put up there is in any way, shape, or form.
[02:03:00.876 --> 02:03:02.197]  Okay.
[02:03:02.197 --> 02:03:04.400]  Uh, and so, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:07.083]  I mean, you know, the trailer is what's in the movie.
[02:03:07.083 --> 02:03:08.344]  I have the script.
[02:03:08.344 --> 02:03:12.969]  And Fox, 20th Century Fox, pulled the trailer.
[02:03:12.969 --> 02:03:14.230]  I mean, what are you implying?
[02:03:14.230 --> 02:03:14.811]  I don't understand.
[02:03:16.297 --> 02:03:17.858]  No, I'm not implying anything, Alex.
[02:03:17.858 --> 02:03:18.499]  That's the whole point.
[02:03:18.499 --> 02:03:20.781]  I said at the beginning, please don't take exception to it.
[02:03:20.781 --> 02:03:29.307]  No, I know, but I'm telling you, I just feel like it's wrong to take somebody's book and publish the whole thing.
[02:03:29.307 --> 02:03:31.369]  I thought it was borderline to even show the script.
[02:03:31.909 --> 02:03:38.092]  And it was any other movie that wasn't about race war and hadn't been paralleled and Arizona hadn't been called out.
[02:03:38.092 --> 02:03:39.892]  This is a message to Arizona.
[02:03:39.892 --> 02:03:45.215]  And if I didn't think it was a psyop, I wouldn't have come out and reached out to the director saying, are you being used here, buddy?
[02:03:45.215 --> 02:03:47.776]  I mean, I was contacted by his people.
[02:03:47.776 --> 02:03:53.198]  And so it's a thin line to walk when you've got a script for a movie five, six months before it comes out.
[02:03:54.284 --> 02:03:56.406]  I guess four months before it comes out.
[02:03:56.406 --> 02:04:07.276]  So, yeah, I mean, we have the script and I'm not going to put the whole thing out because, you know, I don't want to, you know, in hindsight, he said he's cutting the race war stuff out.
[02:04:07.276 --> 02:04:11.720]  And then that even kind of feels dirty to have somebody change something because I'm putting pressure on it.
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:13.861]  I'm not even calling for his censorship.
[02:04:13.861 --> 02:04:15.063]  I'm just speaking out against it.
[02:04:16.228 --> 02:04:19.190]  Uh, and pointing out the taxpayer money did go to it.
[02:04:19.190 --> 02:04:20.070]  What do you think of that?
[02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:24.452]  Uh, but I don't have any wish to damage Robert Rodriguez.
[02:04:24.452 --> 02:04:32.276]  And, you know, I think overall they'll end up helping his film in hindsight that we've talked about it, but now there'll be a counterbalance to it in the debate.
[02:04:32.276 --> 02:04:38.419]  And I think because, I mean, he did say now that he thinks about it, maybe he had too much tequila and he's going to change it.
[02:04:38.999 --> 02:04:43.440]  I mean, my job was to reach out to Robert Rodriguez and say, hey, pal, look at what you're doing.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:47.461]  And as soon as he said, you know what, Alex, you're right.
[02:04:47.461 --> 02:04:48.481]  There is a problem here.
[02:04:48.481 --> 02:04:49.542]  I said, well, I respect that.
[02:04:49.542 --> 02:04:50.882]  Good job.
[02:04:50.882 --> 02:04:51.762]  So there you go.
[02:04:51.762 --> 02:04:52.743]  All right.
[02:04:52.743 --> 02:04:57.344]  We'll come back with our guest and get into the whole situation with Israel and a lot more.
[02:04:57.344 --> 02:04:57.704]  Stay with us.
[02:04:57.704 --> 02:04:58.184]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.373 --> 02:05:02.755]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:05:02.755 --> 02:05:05.078]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:05:05.078 --> 02:05:08.301]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:05:08.301 --> 02:05:13.386]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:05:13.386 --> 02:05:17.590]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:05:17.890 --> 02:05:20.352]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:05:20.352 --> 02:05:22.794]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:05:22.794 --> 02:05:26.037]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:05:26.037 --> 02:05:33.643]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:05:33.979 --> 02:05:39.383]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:05:39.383 --> 02:05:42.224]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:05:42.224 --> 02:05:45.907]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:05:45.907 --> 02:05:46.987]  And I got news for you.
[02:05:46.987 --> 02:05:48.328]  You're everyone else.
[02:05:48.328 --> 02:05:49.829]  Invisible Empire.

[02:06:00.902 --> 02:06:03.906]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:03.906 --> 02:06:09.232]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.232 --> 02:06:11.295]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.295 --> 02:06:16.301]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.301 --> 02:06:17.483]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.483 --> 02:06:18.204]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.584 --> 02:06:20.464]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.464 --> 02:06:21.545]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.545 --> 02:06:23.745]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:23.745 --> 02:06:25.066]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.066 --> 02:06:26.606]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.606 --> 02:06:31.867]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:31.867 --> 02:06:35.468]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.468 --> 02:06:38.929]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.289 --> 02:06:40.509]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.509 --> 02:06:41.410]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.410 --> 02:06:42.510]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:43.430]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:44.530]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.530 --> 02:06:47.591]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.591 --> 02:06:49.772]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.772 --> 02:06:50.792]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.014 --> 02:07:04.998]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:04.998 --> 02:07:05.979]  What have we got?
[02:07:05.979 --> 02:07:08.441]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:08.441 --> 02:07:09.441]  A republic.
[02:07:09.441 --> 02:07:12.083]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:12.083 --> 02:07:14.345]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:14.345 --> 02:07:16.367]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:16.367 --> 02:07:18.048]  So they think they own our land?
[02:07:18.048 --> 02:07:19.369]  They think they own our water?
[02:07:19.369 --> 02:07:19.990]  Children?
[02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:21.110]  Our education?
[02:07:21.110 --> 02:07:21.931]  Our money?
[02:07:21.931 --> 02:07:25.594]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:25.954 --> 02:07:30.920]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:31.941]  We have the facts.
[02:07:31.941 --> 02:07:33.102]  We have the Constitution.
[02:07:33.102 --> 02:07:34.023]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:07:34.023 --> 02:07:34.904]  We have common law.
[02:07:34.904 --> 02:07:37.427]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:37.427 --> 02:07:41.191]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:07:41.311 --> 02:07:46.253]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:07:46.253 --> 02:07:47.754]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:07:47.754 --> 02:07:48.855]  Don't tread on me.
[02:07:48.855 --> 02:08:00.881]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:08:00.881 --> 02:08:06.303]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.303 --> 02:08:08.565]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.623 --> 02:08:10.884]  Yeah.
[02:08:19.913 --> 02:08:21.573]  Gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[02:08:21.573 --> 02:08:25.055]  Eight minutes into this third hour.
[02:08:25.055 --> 02:08:27.096]  Viktor Ostrovsky is our guest.
[02:08:27.096 --> 02:08:31.738]  We had him on many years ago about his book, On the Other Side of Deception.
[02:08:31.738 --> 02:08:42.722]  And of course, the first book was a New York Times number one bestseller, By Way of Deception, and that turned into a big court case when the Israeli government filed a suit trying to block it.
[02:08:42.722 --> 02:08:43.983]  It went to the Supreme Court.
[02:08:45.581 --> 02:09:02.814]  And you can go to his different websites, thebookpatch.com, where alternative books can be published online, or you can go to his fine art website as well, and we'll give you both of those coming up.
[02:09:02.814 --> 02:09:04.295]  But I wanted to get him on because I saw a
[02:09:05.316 --> 02:09:11.745]  Washington Post headline yesterday where he basically criticized what happened and he called it stupid.
[02:09:11.745 --> 02:09:16.012]  It was stupefying stupidity I believe was the quote.
[02:09:16.012 --> 02:09:20.999]  And he is uniquely qualified to talk about this because he was an Israeli naval commander.
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:37.191]  He was also the head of the Israeli Naval Weapons Development Program, and then he was also a case officer in the Israeli Mossad, and then he left and spoke out about corruption, disinfo they gave the government, and other things.
[02:09:37.191 --> 02:09:44.437]  We were talking during the break before he came live, because he hadn't been on in probably four or five years or longer, and I said to him, well just to be clear,
[02:09:45.077 --> 02:09:49.080]  I'm not part of the religion of hating Israel, but I'm also not part of the religion of worshipping Israel.
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:53.804]  Because it seems like there's two different polarized camps, and I make both sides mad at me.
[02:09:53.804 --> 02:09:57.107]  I just think every government's corrupt and out of control, like Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:09:57.107 --> 02:10:03.092]  And I think Israel, you know, just from a layman's term, why not just stop the propellers?
[02:10:03.092 --> 02:10:05.193]  Why not just let it come into dock?
[02:10:05.193 --> 02:10:07.996]  And, you know, then follow any weapons via satellite?
[02:10:08.436 --> 02:10:20.880]  I mean, it was definitely a PR disaster, and now you got Turkey coming in with ships, you got another flotilla coming in with Nobel laureates on board, and you got the North Korea situation with U.S.
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:22.521]  George Washington going there.
[02:10:22.521 --> 02:10:24.422]  All these crises popping up right now.
[02:10:24.422 --> 02:10:27.062]  We couldn't have a better guest on than Victor.
[02:10:27.062 --> 02:10:32.664]  So, Victor, break it down for us first, your experience in the Israeli Navy and then in the Mossad.
[02:10:32.664 --> 02:10:36.826]  I mean, I can't think of anybody better to speak about this than the point you made in the Washington Post.
[02:10:37.466 --> 02:10:50.168]  You believe the actual boots on the ground who have the expertise were ignored, and that Netanyahu and others were running this, and so we'll talk about your history, what you think happened, what was wrong, and what you think they'll do next, knowing their mindset.
[02:10:51.523 --> 02:10:59.165]  First of all, this kind of united all the extremists in Israel.
[02:10:59.165 --> 02:11:06.187]  Actually, when you read in the Israeli papers, the commentary after the articles, they're saying, well, let them come again, we'll send them back in coffins.
[02:11:06.187 --> 02:11:08.568]  I mean, this is the kind of, you know...
[02:11:11.371 --> 02:11:15.194]  Crowd mentality that you get when when things like that take place.
[02:11:15.194 --> 02:11:30.585]  Netanyahu already announced today that he's willing to consider changing in the in the blockade changes in the blockade on Gaza and bring in international forces that would be helpful in checking the materials that are coming in and out.
[02:11:31.825 --> 02:11:37.707]  So, basically, what they tried to do with this flotilla had succeeded.
[02:11:37.707 --> 02:11:51.392]  They wanted to point to a situation which is very disastrous, very bad for the reputation of Israel, this blockade holding so many people in such a dire strait.
[02:11:51.392 --> 02:11:57.274]  The stupidity, in my opinion, was on the tactical side, not necessarily just the political,
[02:11:59.423 --> 02:12:11.088]  You know, sometimes I look at people and you see all the actors and all these people come and talk about politics and what they would do and whatever, and just because people know their name, they think they have a right to an opinion.
[02:12:11.088 --> 02:12:14.689]  I'm not a politician, so put that aside.
[02:12:15.811 --> 02:12:17.952]  Look at the tactical side of it.
[02:12:17.952 --> 02:12:23.756]  Here come ships loaded with civilians who you know what they are carrying.
[02:12:23.756 --> 02:12:25.457]  You know there are no weapons aboard.
[02:12:25.457 --> 02:12:27.598]  The Turkish government has checked that.
[02:12:27.598 --> 02:12:28.818]  It is your ally.
[02:12:28.818 --> 02:12:35.082]  You're about to have a military exercise with the Turks in the Mediterranean.
[02:12:35.082 --> 02:12:36.663]  So it's not really an enemy, right?
[02:12:37.429 --> 02:12:39.690]  And they're saying there are no weapons aboard.
[02:12:39.690 --> 02:12:46.371]  So, you know, take the steps and make it, like, try to stop them outside the territorial water.
[02:12:46.371 --> 02:12:47.852]  The Navy can do that.
[02:12:47.852 --> 02:12:54.794]  The Israeli Navy, the Israeli commandos, probably the best in the world in doing that, after the SEALs, the American SEALs.
[02:12:54.794 --> 02:12:56.614]  They could have stopped them quietly.
[02:12:56.614 --> 02:12:58.995]  The guys on board would not even know what happened.
[02:13:00.123 --> 02:13:15.528]  But first of all, even though you have the San Remo Naval, you know, manual that allows you to board ships if you have an embargo on an area outside your territorial waters, why go there?
[02:13:15.528 --> 02:13:19.109]  Why not let them cross into the territorial waters?
[02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:20.769]  It's still way out of range.
[02:13:20.769 --> 02:13:24.090]  I mean, you're talking about 12, 14 miles.
[02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:24.591]  Let them in.
[02:13:24.591 --> 02:13:25.251]  And then
[02:13:26.454 --> 02:13:31.859]  Take whatever exercise you do, so at least you're taking one bad block off the table.
[02:13:31.859 --> 02:13:34.101]  You're not in international water.
[02:13:34.101 --> 02:13:40.907]  Secondly, the raid itself, the way they came into the ship, that was stupid.
[02:13:40.907 --> 02:13:43.170]  I mean, I've worked with these commandos.
[02:13:43.170 --> 02:13:46.533]  You can come down from a helicopter four at a time.
[02:13:46.533 --> 02:13:52.058]  They chose to come down one at a time because of the narrow area that they had at the top of the ship.
[02:13:52.651 --> 02:13:54.152]  Who comes in the top of the ship?
[02:13:54.152 --> 02:13:59.935]  Why not at the bow or the stern, where you have at least two or three areas that are protected?
[02:13:59.935 --> 02:14:01.556]  The whole operation was stupid.
[02:14:01.556 --> 02:14:08.340]  You clearly saw that this was something that was kind of pulled at the last minute, like somebody was shouting, go, go, go, go, go.
[02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.200]  We don't have any time.
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:09.621]  Let's do it.
[02:14:09.621 --> 02:14:11.001]  Let's do it.
[02:14:11.001 --> 02:14:13.503]  Without... And they had months to plan for this.
[02:14:14.458 --> 02:14:20.723]  So, there goes my stupid, and it's stupid... Well, I think it would have been politically smarter just to let the ships in.
[02:14:20.723 --> 02:14:25.266]  If you know they were searched in Turkey, you know there's not weapons other than clubs.
[02:14:25.266 --> 02:14:27.108]  Let them bring the aid into Gaza.
[02:14:27.108 --> 02:14:28.989]  Well, now you're talking on the political side.
[02:14:28.989 --> 02:14:30.230]  Here's the problem.
[02:14:30.230 --> 02:14:42.920]  The Israelis have stopped the bringing in of supplies into Gaza to a point where, for example, you can bring in, you know, cinnamon, but you can't bring in cardamom.
[02:14:43.827 --> 02:14:52.048]  They have lists of things that the soldiers and the officers are busy making sure what comes in and what doesn't come in.
[02:14:52.048 --> 02:14:54.309]  The blockade is not just against weapons.
[02:14:54.309 --> 02:15:04.431]  They're not allowing construction materials like concrete and metal, because they're saying the metal will be used for missiles, the concrete will be used for bunkers.
[02:15:04.431 --> 02:15:10.812]  They don't, and yet they had... And this is after the last raid into Gaza, which demolished, you know, 35% of all
[02:15:12.745 --> 02:15:13.025]  I think?
[02:15:36.235 --> 02:15:40.937]  That is almost vicious in its behavior to that.
[02:15:40.937 --> 02:15:46.240]  That would never have been done and never has been done in the West Bank.
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:52.603]  They're trying to basically tell the populace in Gaza, as long as you have the Hamas as your leaders,
[02:15:54.043 --> 02:15:55.643]  You're going to be suffering.
[02:15:55.643 --> 02:15:57.604]  And that's against the Geneva Convention.
[02:15:57.604 --> 02:15:58.424]  It's against everything else.
[02:15:58.424 --> 02:16:05.905]  You cannot... And that's also, historically, just going to turn the population who wasn't radicalized to Hamas and only make them dig in.
[02:16:05.905 --> 02:16:07.365]  Absolutely.
[02:16:07.365 --> 02:16:08.326]  And we know that.
[02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:19.768]  I mean, you know... I mean, the bottom line, there's a... The philosophy that always was prevalent in Israel was you can't fight ideas with force.
[02:16:19.768 --> 02:16:22.308]  The only way you fight an idea is with a better idea.
[02:16:23.068 --> 02:16:25.089]  Uh, and this has been forgotten.
[02:16:25.089 --> 02:16:30.470]  It's like, we can force them to surrender, and we know that's not possible.
[02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:37.152]  I mean, we had a blockade against the state of Israel before it was a state.
[02:16:37.152 --> 02:16:40.133]  It was still Palestine, and the British put a blockade.
[02:16:40.982 --> 02:16:41.923]  And it didn't help.
[02:16:41.923 --> 02:16:43.324]  We kept bringing in people.
[02:16:43.324 --> 02:16:44.385]  We brought in arms.
[02:16:44.385 --> 02:16:46.727]  We, you know, we fought them off.
[02:16:46.727 --> 02:16:51.432]  Because the stronger they fought, the harder we fought back.
[02:16:51.432 --> 02:16:54.274]  This is the way people are.
[02:16:54.274 --> 02:16:56.576]  There are three kinds of terrorism.
[02:16:56.576 --> 02:17:00.220]  There's psychological or what's called ideological.
[02:17:00.862 --> 02:17:07.907]  Terrorists, you have the territorial terrorists, and you have the, you know, the Looney Tunes.
[02:17:07.907 --> 02:17:14.352]  Well, the Looney Tunes and the ideological ones you can usually beat, but the territorial ones you can't.
[02:17:14.352 --> 02:17:17.694]  These are people fighting for freedom on their land.
[02:17:17.694 --> 02:17:19.916]  They almost always succeed.
[02:17:19.916 --> 02:17:25.280]  I mean, take it from the, starting from the American Revolution, and you go through every
[02:17:26.403 --> 02:17:26.863]  Time.
[02:17:26.863 --> 02:17:32.244]  You've got Vietnam, you've got the 80s with the Afghans and the Russians.
[02:17:32.244 --> 02:17:33.485]  I mean, it's... Always.
[02:17:33.485 --> 02:17:34.045]  It's always.
[02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:46.128]  And the people who have the ideological ones, which used to be, like, the Baader-Meinhof or the Red Army Brigades or any one of those, they have disappeared in time.
[02:17:46.128 --> 02:17:51.589]  That's why al-Qaeda, for example, tries to latch itself on to a territorial
[02:17:52.149 --> 02:17:52.749]  It's the Mecca!
[02:17:52.749 --> 02:17:53.030]  It's the Mecca.
[02:18:20.729 --> 02:18:21.690]  Absolutely.
[02:18:21.690 --> 02:18:22.170]  Absolutely.
[02:18:22.170 --> 02:18:23.871]  There's no question about that.
[02:18:23.871 --> 02:18:26.652]  And the suffering there is unbelievable.
[02:18:26.652 --> 02:18:29.953]  I mean, people don't understand what we're talking about.
[02:18:29.953 --> 02:18:40.158]  Going to the Gaza Strip, Soweto in South Africa, at its worst, was a paradise compared to what's going on in Gaza.
[02:18:42.085 --> 02:18:52.949]  It's incredible, and the time we've got, I want to get into your books and some of the things you criticize the Israeli government and the Mossad did when you were involved in it, and also the Navy.
[02:18:52.949 --> 02:19:01.892]  But you talked about militarily, if they were going to do this, you would go in an open-top wet submarine, or basically a glorified underwater sea-doo.
[02:19:03.032 --> 02:19:12.079]  And then basically, there's a lot of different ways to disable those propellers, and then it doesn't give the people wanting to have this big standoff a spectacular event.
[02:19:12.079 --> 02:19:16.122]  Because, you know, at a base level, people always cheer for the underdog.
[02:19:16.122 --> 02:19:20.646]  You got folks, you know, with clubs getting shot by commandos.
[02:19:20.646 --> 02:19:26.490]  I mean, that, any way you slice it, is going to be a PR disaster for Israel.
[02:19:26.490 --> 02:19:29.292]  And again, I'm no genius about all this stuff, but I can see that.
[02:19:29.292 --> 02:19:32.375]  I mean, it seems like a five-year-old can mentally work through all this.
[02:19:33.453 --> 02:19:34.213]  Absolutely.
[02:19:34.213 --> 02:19:37.515]  It's stupefying.
[02:19:37.515 --> 02:19:55.301]  I mean, how do you even explain it when you have the Israeli government responding and saying, okay, they came down with commandos on board ships in the middle of the night from a helicopter, and then they're saying that the people defending themselves are attacking the soldiers?
[02:19:55.301 --> 02:19:58.262]  I mean, even the explanation is stupid.
[02:19:58.262 --> 02:19:59.062]  Stay there, Victor.
[02:19:59.062 --> 02:20:00.243]  This is Key Info, coming up.
[02:20:01.069 --> 02:20:05.612]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.612 --> 02:20:06.532]  Number one.
[02:20:06.532 --> 02:20:09.954]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:09.954 --> 02:20:10.815]  Number two.
[02:20:10.815 --> 02:20:15.698]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.698 --> 02:20:16.438]  It's true.
[02:20:16.438 --> 02:20:21.001]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.321 --> 02:20:22.141]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.141 --> 02:20:25.722]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.722 --> 02:20:29.643]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.643 --> 02:20:30.444]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.444 --> 02:20:33.185]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.185 --> 02:20:36.886]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.886 --> 02:20:37.666]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.666 --> 02:20:41.547]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.807 --> 02:20:46.849]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.849 --> 02:20:51.031]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.031 --> 02:20:52.812]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.812 --> 02:20:57.434]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.095 --> 02:21:04.059]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:21:04.059 --> 02:21:08.205]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:21:08.205 --> 02:21:10.488]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:21:10.488 --> 02:21:15.655]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:21:15.655 --> 02:21:17.477]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:21:17.477 --> 02:21:18.779]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:21:18.999 --> 02:21:20.480]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:23.861]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:21:23.861 --> 02:21:29.223]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:29.223 --> 02:21:38.327]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[02:21:38.567 --> 02:21:43.749]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:21:43.749 --> 02:21:47.211]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.
[02:21:47.211 --> 02:21:51.032]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.032 --> 02:21:53.593]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[02:21:53.593 --> 02:21:53.733]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:02.424 --> 02:22:04.948]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:22:04.948 --> 02:22:06.210]  Tyranny is here.
[02:22:06.210 --> 02:22:09.975]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:22:09.975 --> 02:22:12.379]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:12.379 --> 02:22:17.747]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:19.924 --> 02:22:30.852]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:30.852 --> 02:22:35.075]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:22:35.075 --> 02:22:39.358]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:22:39.358 --> 02:22:45.302]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:45.302 --> 02:22:48.184]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:48.824 --> 02:22:50.805]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:50.805 --> 02:22:51.925]  It's here.

[02:23:00.047 --> 02:23:01.187]  Fatigue.
[02:23:01.187 --> 02:23:02.308]  Headaches.
[02:23:02.308 --> 02:23:03.648]  Allergies and asthma.
[02:23:03.648 --> 02:23:05.068]  Chronic disease.
[02:23:05.068 --> 02:23:06.929]  Is your home making you sick?
[02:23:06.929 --> 02:23:07.869]  Here's a fact.
[02:23:07.869 --> 02:23:09.909]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse.
[02:23:09.909 --> 02:23:15.511]  And the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[02:23:19.445 --> 02:23:19.645]  We're good.
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:38.100]  We're good to go.
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:18.248]  Victor Ostrofsky is our guest, naval commander, the head of their naval weapons program, and then of course recruited to be a case officer for the Israeli Mossad.
[02:24:18.248 --> 02:24:21.010]  And he's authored two non-fiction books about his service in the Mossad.
[02:24:21.010 --> 02:24:29.155]  We're going to tell you about his website, thebookpatch.com, coming up, or ostrofskyfineart.com.
[02:24:29.155 --> 02:24:30.616]  This is a short segment.
[02:24:30.616 --> 02:24:33.598]  You were finishing up with the plight of what's happening in Gaza.
[02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:44.811]  Uh, and then I want you to elaborate on the mindset of the Likudniks, uh, who say, Hey, we got 400 nukes and, you know, we're just ready to go wild.
[02:24:44.811 --> 02:24:49.336]  I mean, basically, I mean, chutzpah is the word and then expanding on that.
[02:24:51.298 --> 02:24:52.719]  What do you see happening with Turkey?
[02:24:52.719 --> 02:24:55.400]  They're saying they're going to send naval ships in.
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:03.485]  They're saying that more ships from Ireland and Malta and other places are coming.
[02:25:03.485 --> 02:25:05.886]  And what do you expect Israel to do?
[02:25:05.886 --> 02:25:11.909]  Well, according to the Prime Minister, he's already starting to show that he's under U.S.
[02:25:11.909 --> 02:25:16.032]  pressure and that he just may ease the Gaza siege.
[02:25:16.032 --> 02:25:17.873]  I mean, there's no question about that.
[02:25:17.873 --> 02:25:19.714]  And easing it in a way that he would
[02:25:20.294 --> 02:25:33.163]  Kind of like backtrack, but not lose face to his own party, which is an extreme right-wing party in Israel, which has people like Lieberman and others who are extremely right-wing.
[02:25:33.163 --> 02:25:40.048]  I mean, these are people who are calling for any citizen in Israel to make an oath of allegiance to Israel as a Jewish state.
[02:25:40.048 --> 02:25:49.214]  Now, that would be a problem for a lot of Palestinians who are not Jewish, and he wants them to lose their citizenship should they not be willing to make that oath.
[02:25:50.354 --> 02:25:52.615]  So that's the kind of people we're dealing with.
[02:25:52.615 --> 02:25:56.257]  So Netanyahu is caught between, you know, the rock and the hard place.
[02:25:56.257 --> 02:26:01.999]  Even if he wants to compromise, he has to do it in a way that he shows that he's not losing face.
[02:26:01.999 --> 02:26:12.323]  He will try and give some leniency towards materials coming in, and that would alleviate the situation in the Gaza Strip without a question.
[02:26:13.385 --> 02:26:21.913]  Turkey may, may, I don't think they will, but they may send, you know, an escort, a military escort with those ships.
[02:26:21.913 --> 02:26:25.657]  Then the question is, do you actually confront them?
[02:26:25.657 --> 02:26:28.900]  Do you put Israeli ships to confront Turkish ships?
[02:26:30.601 --> 02:26:33.162]  That I don't think is something Israel would want to do.
[02:26:33.162 --> 02:26:37.465]  Now the Turkish ships would not cross into Israeli waters.
[02:26:37.465 --> 02:26:43.267]  They would probably stop in the international water on the line if that were to happen.
[02:26:45.006 --> 02:26:50.367]  Now, we're dealing with countries here that are easy to get, you know, to heat up.
[02:26:50.367 --> 02:26:57.809]  You know, Turkey, with all due respect, is not exactly your, you know, your angel in the area.
[02:26:57.809 --> 02:27:01.550]  I mean, they're dealing with the Kurds in a way that, you know, nobody wants to.
[02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:04.091]  They're preventing them from their own languages.
[02:27:04.091 --> 02:27:05.531]  There's a lot of things they have there.
[02:27:06.051 --> 02:27:15.476]  Yeah, Turkey's got a military iron fist and basically a front government, and that's on record, and that's going to destabilize Turkey if they are put into a confrontation with Israel.
[02:27:15.476 --> 02:27:27.223]  Absolutely, and it's an internal problem that they have to solve too, and Radwan, who is, you know, trying to show a face to the Muslim world in what he's doing, basically this whole situation has four
[02:27:27.503 --> 02:27:28.023]  Of course.
[02:27:43.131 --> 02:27:49.312]  At least three years in this blockade had had to back off and open the border, you know, between Gaza and Israel.
[02:27:49.312 --> 02:27:54.373]  Already 500 Palestinians had been allowed into Egypt and they're allowing a lot more.
[02:27:54.373 --> 02:28:00.814]  Something they had not done for the last three years under extreme pressure, you know, from all the Arab world.
[02:28:00.814 --> 02:28:02.114]  And they have allowed it now.
[02:28:02.114 --> 02:28:07.175]  So basically it's kind of like, talk about shoot yourself in the foot.
[02:28:07.175 --> 02:28:09.976]  This is exactly what they have done.
[02:28:10.596 --> 02:28:31.784]  Had they stopped them out in the water, like you said before, with those what's called wet submarines, which is really a torpedo, a large torpedo with two or three or six seats in it, that people are, you know, divers are in it with their oxygen tanks and whatever, they could have come close to the rear end of those ships and stopped them without nobody on board even knowing what happened.
[02:28:31.784 --> 02:28:36.306]  They could have boarded these ships in a way that would be a lot easier to handle.
[02:28:36.306 --> 02:28:36.526]  I mean,
[02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:48.715]  Again, they basically almost started the riot by, you know, they threw tear gas grenades first before they came off the helicopters, and then figured that's what's going to happen.
[02:28:48.715 --> 02:28:53.737]  And now some of them are saying, well, we came down with paintball rifles.
[02:28:53.737 --> 02:28:56.979]  Well, okay, even if they had paintball rifles, which I doubt,
[02:28:58.141 --> 02:29:01.603]  How does the guy on the ground know that what's aiming at him is a paintball rifle?
[02:29:01.603 --> 02:29:04.385]  Well, how do all these people get killed if it's paintball?
[02:29:04.385 --> 02:29:06.907]  Well, and here's the funny part.
[02:29:06.907 --> 02:29:10.169]  They say paintball rifles, but then they say what they shot at us.
[02:29:10.169 --> 02:29:13.851]  They say that they didn't have any, that the people in the ship did not have any weapons.
[02:29:13.851 --> 02:29:18.054]  They said, yeah, but they took some weapons from Israeli soldiers and then shot at them.
[02:29:18.054 --> 02:29:24.018]  Well, how is it that when an Israeli soldier shoots, it's a paintball rifle, and when he's shot back, it's a real gun?
[02:29:24.458 --> 02:29:28.621]  It's amazing propaganda, but just to be clear earlier, we're going to break.
[02:29:28.621 --> 02:29:30.823]  We'll get the answer when we come back.
[02:29:30.823 --> 02:29:36.286]  You're saying that it's good the people were defending themselves, or that's a normal response.
[02:29:36.286 --> 02:29:39.348]  I mean, that's what I got from what you said before the last break.
[02:29:39.348 --> 02:29:40.269]  So stay there, sir.
[02:29:40.269 --> 02:29:42.030]  We'll come back, long segment.
[02:29:42.030 --> 02:29:44.432]  Get your take on that.
[02:29:44.432 --> 02:29:49.415]  And then we'll overall talk about the state of Israel, period, and where you see the whole world going.
[02:29:49.415 --> 02:29:49.816]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.161 --> 02:29:55.087]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.087 --> 02:29:57.770]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.512 --> 02:30:04.695]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:04.695 --> 02:30:11.100]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:18.486]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:30:18.486 --> 02:30:23.370]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:30:23.370 --> 02:30:25.512]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:30:28.314 --> 02:30:29.936]  It's powder and owner for over 63 years.
[02:30:29.936 --> 02:30:32.058]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[02:30:32.058 --> 02:30:34.561]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:30:46.934 --> 02:30:54.368]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:30:54.368 --> 02:30:54.829]  Thank you!
[02:31:01.533 --> 02:31:10.019]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[02:31:10.019 --> 02:31:20.906]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[02:31:20.906 --> 02:31:26.350]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[02:31:26.890 --> 02:31:31.793]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[02:31:31.793 --> 02:31:40.859]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[02:31:40.859 --> 02:31:50.966]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[02:31:50.966 --> 02:31:54.649]  That's www.silverlungs.com.

[02:32:00.273 --> 02:32:01.574]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:01.574 --> 02:32:07.158]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.158 --> 02:32:12.182]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:12.182 --> 02:32:17.226]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:32:17.746 --> 02:32:22.970]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:22.970 --> 02:32:25.291]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:32:25.291 --> 02:32:30.094]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.094 --> 02:32:31.215]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.215 --> 02:32:34.277]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:32:34.277 --> 02:32:37.900]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:41.102]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:41.102 --> 02:32:43.323]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:43.323 --> 02:32:44.244]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:47.887 --> 02:32:49.308]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:49.308 --> 02:32:56.939]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:56.939 --> 02:32:59.322]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:06.237 --> 02:33:08.098]  We're going back to our guest here in a moment.
[02:33:08.098 --> 02:33:15.120]  I may even keep him a little bit in the next hour, if he can do it, to take a few calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:21.403]  Wanted to remind you, we have an online video bookstore, Shopping Cart, at Infowars.com.
[02:33:21.403 --> 02:33:27.105]  And my film, Fall of the Republic, exposes how there's a global corporate takeover of every sovereign nation on Earth.
[02:33:28.305 --> 02:33:31.487]  And how these big banks have sold derivatives to the nation states.
[02:33:31.487 --> 02:33:35.310]  This is just a form of neo-colonialism and a stealth empire.
[02:33:35.310 --> 02:33:38.472]  And if we're aware of this system, it will not succeed.
[02:33:38.472 --> 02:33:39.673]  And it's already in deep trouble.
[02:33:40.509 --> 02:33:44.873]  So be sure and get Fall of the Republic, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:44.873 --> 02:33:48.396]  A two-hour film with expanded extras, such an important documentary.
[02:33:48.396 --> 02:33:53.381]  Jason Burmess' Invisible Empire and Who Will Be Defined just came out about a month and a half ago.
[02:33:53.381 --> 02:33:56.344]  Getting into the globalists and their overall master operation.
[02:33:56.344 --> 02:34:02.529]  And of course, a solution video, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, with myself, Michael Bagnerik, Charles Keeb.
[02:34:03.530 --> 02:34:03.831]  I think so.

[02:35:33.045 --> 02:35:35.067]  Weapons-Universe.com.
[02:35:35.067 --> 02:35:36.268]  And speaking of great info...
[02:35:37.289 --> 02:35:40.330]  Because they tried to censor his best-selling books.
[02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:42.651]  He set up thebookpatch.com.
[02:35:42.651 --> 02:35:49.553]  Victor Ostrowski, again, former Israeli naval commander and the Mossad case officer, commander.
[02:35:49.553 --> 02:35:51.674]  Tell us about thebookpatch.com.
[02:35:52.301 --> 02:35:57.108]  Well, the Book Patch is a website that is designed for writers of all kinds.
[02:35:57.108 --> 02:35:58.309]  It's absolutely free.
[02:35:58.309 --> 02:36:00.753]  You go there and you can start writing your book.
[02:36:00.753 --> 02:36:07.903]  We have writing tools that are not available anywhere that I designed for myself and then made it available on that site.
[02:36:08.524 --> 02:36:09.365]  You can write there.
[02:36:09.365 --> 02:36:11.206]  You can invite your friends to join you.
[02:36:11.206 --> 02:36:13.127]  You can co-author with others.
[02:36:13.127 --> 02:36:14.248]  You can communicate.
[02:36:14.248 --> 02:36:18.390]  You can write from anywhere that you have an internet connection.
[02:36:18.390 --> 02:36:22.813]  You can use the site to have other people read your chapters and comment.
[02:36:22.813 --> 02:36:26.295]  You can hire or get editors to help you do that.
[02:36:26.295 --> 02:36:30.498]  And when you're done and everything is finished, you can press a button and get it.
[02:36:30.498 --> 02:36:36.562]  Either download it as a PDF to yourself or order a real hard copy, you know, book.
[02:36:36.562 --> 02:36:37.923]  You can order a single copy.
[02:36:38.643 --> 02:36:51.290]  And, you know, you can get your first book for like $16, and then it goes down by the time you reach book number 10, you're less than about $8 or $7 a copy.
[02:36:51.290 --> 02:36:56.833]  Wow, so that's a very affordable books on demand, but really one-stop shop.
[02:36:56.833 --> 02:36:59.255]  Absolutely, and you don't have to order them.
[02:36:59.255 --> 02:37:04.117]  In fact, if you finish writing it, you can put it in the bookstore and other people will order it, and then they buy it.
[02:37:04.117 --> 02:37:06.939]  You don't have to order books, you don't have to put any expenditure out.
[02:37:07.379 --> 02:37:07.719]  Forward.
[02:37:07.719 --> 02:37:16.703]  I mean, I think people who have a talent or have something to say and have to have, want to have a book out, don't have to go into a big spending spree in order to get one in their hand.
[02:37:16.703 --> 02:37:23.265]  I think, you know, it should be something that's really easy and cheap and inexpensive.
[02:37:23.265 --> 02:37:24.506]  And that's what we try to do.
[02:37:24.506 --> 02:37:32.189]  And that's why the book patches is, you know, we have over, we've launched it about two weeks ago and we have over 400 people writing books as we speak.
[02:37:32.489 --> 02:37:33.109]  Amazing.
[02:37:33.109 --> 02:37:41.334]  No, it's a genius idea and I hope folks check it out and we'll talk about why you launched it from your experience of attempted censorship.
[02:37:41.334 --> 02:37:48.137]  Now finishing up, before we get into some other subjects with you while we have you, what do you expect to happen though?
[02:37:48.137 --> 02:37:54.641]  I mean you're saying it'd be smart of Netanyahu to back off and you're saying it looks like he is a little bit, but the same
[02:37:55.541 --> 02:38:01.867]  Bravado or arrogance, or I don't know what you call it, that caused this could lead to more.
[02:38:01.867 --> 02:38:07.772]  I mean, I don't want you to look into a crystal ball because none of us have one, but what do you think is most likely to happen?
[02:38:07.772 --> 02:38:11.134]  Well, I think that the ships are going to continue coming.
[02:38:11.134 --> 02:38:13.517]  There's no question about that.
[02:38:13.517 --> 02:38:16.079]  And you can understand why.
[02:38:16.079 --> 02:38:20.042]  There is people in suffering and there is a need to help.
[02:38:20.042 --> 02:38:21.964]  So this is just one covers the other.
[02:38:22.944 --> 02:38:25.306]  And there is a force trying to stop them.
[02:38:25.306 --> 02:38:28.088]  And people feel that they're justified in doing it.
[02:38:28.088 --> 02:38:32.571]  And more and more volunteers will join and make that happen.
[02:38:32.571 --> 02:38:36.914]  It's kind of like, you know, fighting the good fight, so to speak.
[02:38:36.914 --> 02:38:44.419]  What would happen is that Israel will find a way, and I think that's what they're working on now, to allow the ship closer in.
[02:38:45.245 --> 02:38:57.649]  To surround it in a way that it's not harmful to the people on board and to show that they're allowing the material to come down, but they don't want the big presentation.
[02:38:57.649 --> 02:39:00.069]  That is the best smart way to do it.
[02:39:00.069 --> 02:39:09.112]  But again, considering the fact that we're dealing with the same people who send commandos in the middle of the night to drop onto a ship,
[02:39:10.551 --> 02:39:17.776]  Uh, fully armed, and then complained that they were being attacked, then, you know, uh, what do you say?
[02:39:17.776 --> 02:39:19.778]  I mean, what could you... Well, that's another point.
[02:39:19.778 --> 02:39:26.622]  I mean, there's that archetypal thing of men lowering down in the night, uh, that's when the bad guys come.
[02:39:26.622 --> 02:39:27.863]  That's right, and you're scared of that.
[02:39:27.863 --> 02:39:29.404]  I mean, wouldn't you be scared?
[02:39:29.404 --> 02:39:37.570]  I mean, what would you... Now, don't forget, we're talking about people that have been dealing with Israel on the, you know, on the sharp side of the bayonet.
[02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:42.153]  Yeah, a lot of the people on that boat have family or cousins or friends that are dead.
[02:39:55.038 --> 02:39:55.879]  I would not know.
[02:39:55.879 --> 02:39:59.661]  You know, I don't know, but I know a lot of them are volunteers who have heard about this.
[02:39:59.661 --> 02:40:01.662]  Some of them were former Gazans, yeah.
[02:40:01.662 --> 02:40:08.927]  Yes, yes, and some of them are people that, you know, have never been back to Israel and, you know, their families have been evicted in 1948.
[02:40:08.927 --> 02:40:12.629]  So you don't know, but there's a lot of tension going on.
[02:40:12.629 --> 02:40:15.511]  And now when they're being attacked they have no idea or no
[02:40:16.271 --> 02:40:19.614]  They can believe that, you know, the soldiers are coming to kill them.
[02:40:19.614 --> 02:40:21.535]  I mean, they don't know.
[02:40:21.535 --> 02:40:28.461]  And it's not like the Israelis came down from the helicopter, you know, threw down ballots and said, we're coming in in a force.
[02:40:28.461 --> 02:40:29.862]  Do not resist us.
[02:40:29.862 --> 02:40:31.323]  You know, we will fire at it.
[02:40:31.323 --> 02:40:36.467]  They just came down those ropes and the people and to say that they had weapons.
[02:40:37.176 --> 02:40:39.197]  I mean, they're showing kitchen knives.
[02:40:39.197 --> 02:40:42.458]  Show me a cruise ship that doesn't have kitchen knives.
[02:40:42.458 --> 02:40:44.039]  Or binoculars.
[02:40:44.039 --> 02:40:45.899]  What kind of weapons are those?
[02:40:45.899 --> 02:40:49.841]  Well, they're calling binoculars night vision, but expanding on that...
[02:40:53.903 --> 02:41:05.709]  A Arab member of the Israeli Knesset is on record, you've probably seen this, saying that Israel wanted high casualties to intimidate people from coming.
[02:41:05.709 --> 02:41:10.252]  But watching the video, and correct me if you think I'm wrong, it doesn't really look like that.
[02:41:10.252 --> 02:41:12.673]  It just looks like Laurel and Hardy, basically.
[02:41:12.873 --> 02:41:14.454]  Absolutely.
[02:41:14.454 --> 02:41:14.934]  You know what?
[02:41:14.934 --> 02:41:27.282]  There is no way, no legitimate government in Israel, and I don't care if they're right-wing or left-wing or center, would send people out to go kill them.
[02:41:27.282 --> 02:41:34.046]  Anybody who says that doesn't know what the hell they're talking about, because that would not happen, and nobody would ever dare even say that.
[02:41:34.046 --> 02:41:36.207]  Well, it wouldn't happen because it would be a PR disaster.
[02:41:36.653 --> 02:41:41.318]  Well no, it wouldn't happen because that is not what Israelis are about.
[02:41:41.318 --> 02:41:45.141]  That's not, you know, that's taking it to a degree that it's not there.
[02:41:45.141 --> 02:41:47.944]  Alright, well let me expand on that since you brought that up.
[02:41:47.944 --> 02:41:56.853]  What about the USS Liberty, two years ago that they did declassify the NSA intercepts, that Israel was not being honest about why they attacked that ship?
[02:41:57.153 --> 02:41:59.374]  Well, let me tell you this about the Liberty.
[02:41:59.374 --> 02:42:00.295]  I was in the Navy.
[02:42:00.295 --> 02:42:02.496]  I was not in the Navy at the time that it happened.
[02:42:02.496 --> 02:42:15.243]  I can tell you categorically, okay, from my knowledge of the people who were involved at the time in the Israeli Navy, categorically, and you can see that I'm not somebody who goes out to defend Israel.
[02:42:15.243 --> 02:42:17.144]  Categorically, this was an accident.
[02:42:17.811 --> 02:42:20.093]  Now, there was a lot of screw-ups on the way.
[02:42:20.093 --> 02:42:23.496]  I have spoken to many people of the Liberty.
[02:42:23.496 --> 02:42:24.938]  I have said this again and again.
[02:42:24.938 --> 02:42:33.646]  There was an ambassador from Lebanon, an American ambassador in Lebanon, who said, and this was, he was making a speech, and I was on the phone.
[02:42:33.646 --> 02:42:36.569]  I was on a remote, you know, contact.
[02:42:36.949 --> 02:42:51.512]  And he said that he personally heard Israeli pilots talking to each other and saying that they recognize or they notified or they saw the flag that was being waved and that it's an American ship and they said, doesn't matter, let's go attack anyway.
[02:42:51.512 --> 02:42:54.652]  And then I turned to him and I spoke to him in Hebrew.
[02:42:54.652 --> 02:42:57.513]  And he did not respond because he said he doesn't understand Hebrew.
[02:42:57.513 --> 02:43:00.713]  So I asked him, how did you hear their voices saying that?
[02:43:00.713 --> 02:43:04.294]  Because you think the Israeli pilots were talking English just for you?
[02:43:05.944 --> 02:43:09.847]  And he kind of backed off, and he said, no, I read it in the transcripts.
[02:43:09.847 --> 02:43:13.369]  I said, but you just said you heard them in your own ears.
[02:43:13.369 --> 02:43:14.469]  And it went on and on.
[02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:31.760]  There's a lot of fabrication going on about that particular piece, but I can tell you categorically, knowing the people, I also know that the head of the Israeli Navy at the time was not found anywhere, and everybody was looking for him because they had the skunk on the radars, a skunk being an unidentified ship.
[02:43:32.415 --> 02:43:36.642]  And he was nowhere to be had because he was having an affair in the middle of the war.
[02:43:36.642 --> 02:43:42.070]  So, you know, not everybody came out smelling well from that, but that was not a deliberate act.
[02:43:43.244 --> 02:43:48.727]  And the mistakes were, you know, colossal.
[02:43:48.727 --> 02:44:08.416]  Well, I've interviewed the admirals, and they're all dead now, but those interviews are there, and they said that when they got on the phone to McNamara and said, we're sending ships to defend, McNamara said, no, you're not to, and they refused his order, and then LBJ came on and said, look, that ship's going to the GD bottom, and that basically it was a pre-done deal to blame it on Egypt, but you're saying that isn't the deal.
[02:44:09.016 --> 02:44:09.717]  No, no, no.
[02:44:09.717 --> 02:44:11.278]  You're mixing two things.
[02:44:11.278 --> 02:44:20.166]  The fact that there was a cover-up after that, and that American ships or forces were not sent to aid, and all that, that is accurate.
[02:44:20.166 --> 02:44:21.227]  I don't know about that.
[02:44:21.227 --> 02:44:23.048]  I can't say to that anything.
[02:44:23.048 --> 02:44:30.194]  I can only say that the attack on the ship itself was not a deliberate act by the Israeli Navy or the Israeli Air Force.
[02:44:30.194 --> 02:44:33.497]  And nobody who fired at any point has
[02:44:34.512 --> 02:44:38.075]  Well, how could torpedo boats not see an American flag?
[02:44:38.075 --> 02:44:42.077]  They did not see the flag because the flag was being waved towards the planes.
[02:44:55.365 --> 02:44:56.767]  This is all I can tell you.
[02:44:56.767 --> 02:45:03.374]  I mean, I can't get into a lot of detail about it because of the fact that I have not been there.
[02:45:03.374 --> 02:45:05.656]  But I know the people that were involved.
[02:45:05.656 --> 02:45:16.688]  And on a personal level, this is completely on a personal level, I can vouch for every one of them knowing that none of the people I know would have opened fire on an American ship.
[02:45:16.688 --> 02:45:17.829]  Yeah, take it for what it's worth.
[02:45:18.243 --> 02:45:22.924]  Yeah, well, from my research, it looks like a live-action Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:45:22.924 --> 02:45:28.006]  I mean, again, I'm not... No, no, no, no, actually not.
[02:45:28.006 --> 02:45:39.729]  Now, where I find it hard to fathom, what I do find hard to fathom is the fact that the airplanes, the planes did not see the flag.
[02:45:39.729 --> 02:45:40.909]  Now, I don't know.
[02:45:40.909 --> 02:45:45.611]  Now, maybe a pilot was strafing and he saw the flag at the last minute and he doesn't want to admit it.
[02:45:45.611 --> 02:45:46.751]  That could have been the case.
[02:45:48.098 --> 02:45:49.099]  I don't know.
[02:45:49.099 --> 02:45:52.840]  I've seen the footage from the machine gun cameras, right?
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:57.561]  And when it passes over, you don't see any flag at that point.
[02:45:57.561 --> 02:46:01.222]  And in fact, that is available in the Israeli Navy book.
[02:46:01.222 --> 02:46:02.103]  I have a copy of that book.
[02:46:02.103 --> 02:46:02.343]  No, I know.
[02:46:02.343 --> 02:46:03.943]  I've seen the footage on television.
[02:46:03.943 --> 02:46:07.584]  It's a gray gun pod camera.
[02:46:07.584 --> 02:46:12.946]  You see a big black blob, but his eyes weren't shooting black and white film.
[02:46:13.166 --> 02:46:14.829]  Absolutely, I can't argue with that.
[02:46:14.829 --> 02:46:15.710]  So that's what I'm saying.
[02:46:15.710 --> 02:46:19.277]  I can tell you from the Navy standpoint, the people who were on board
[02:46:20.429 --> 02:46:25.332]  Okay, well that's your take on it.
[02:46:25.332 --> 02:46:27.734]  I don't want to burn up all of our time.
[02:46:27.734 --> 02:46:47.786]  Separately, you've written two books and I remember one account about the Israelis, what, submarine jacking in to a Libyan communications facility and sending out false flag info that then got Reagan to send in the aardvarks and blow up Gaddafi's tents.
[02:46:47.786 --> 02:46:49.527]  Break that down for us and talk about your books.
[02:46:49.747 --> 02:47:08.176]  Well, okay, this was written in The Other Side of Deception, which is my second non-fictional book, and I described there what happened was there were Mossad units with special forces that came in and installed a bounce-off device, which is kind of like a... it's a communication system that
[02:47:08.934 --> 02:47:12.275]  You can broadcast to it from some location.
[02:47:12.275 --> 02:47:20.977]  It then takes the communication that you've sent to it and will bounce it off as if it's coming from a source very close to where it's located.
[02:47:20.977 --> 02:47:24.557]  In fact, they put it in an apartment building, which was a block and a half or two blocks away.
[02:47:24.557 --> 02:47:30.118]  I don't remember exactly, from the Libyan High Command.
[02:47:30.118 --> 02:47:36.520]  And they broadcast information in code that was then broken
[02:47:38.112 --> 02:47:49.417]  To say that they basically took responsibility, that the Libyans put responsibility on the Libyans for the LaBelle attack where an American serviceman was killed.
[02:47:49.417 --> 02:48:00.022]  And that called in itself as a terrorist attack against American forces, brought about the attack by Reagan, who called in an air attack on Libya that
[02:48:00.908 --> 02:48:01.088]  Yes.
[02:48:01.088 --> 02:48:01.289]  Yes.
[02:48:01.289 --> 02:48:03.051]  This is the information that I'm talking about.
[02:48:16.670 --> 02:48:17.351]  They never were.
[02:48:17.351 --> 02:48:21.053]  Well, Israel's not happy about anything I say.
[02:48:21.053 --> 02:48:25.596]  The point is, I don't wave flags.
[02:48:25.596 --> 02:48:29.399]  When I talk about these things, I talk about either what I know... No, I understand.
[02:48:29.399 --> 02:48:31.140]  It sounds like you're saying you're a political atheist.
[02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:32.421]  Well, what are some other interests?
[02:48:32.421 --> 02:48:34.803]  I mean, what made you get upset with the Mossad?
[02:48:34.803 --> 02:48:37.485]  And critically, what are some of the other misdeeds?
[02:48:37.485 --> 02:48:41.588]  Well, what got me... I'm not a political atheist.
[02:48:41.588 --> 02:48:43.969]  I have a left leaning, and I admit that.
[02:48:43.969 --> 02:48:46.271]  And I think the Palestinians should have a state.
[02:48:46.511 --> 02:48:51.832]  Well, by political, I mean atheist, I mean you just try to analyze the facts, you see.
[02:48:51.832 --> 02:48:54.833]  Yes, I do.
[02:48:54.833 --> 02:49:05.775]  My main concern with the Mossad, my main problem with the Mossad was the fact that the Mossad is a very important entity in the protection of the State of Israel.
[02:49:05.775 --> 02:49:09.956]  And what it should do is gather information, analyze it to the best of its ability,
[02:49:10.496 --> 02:49:22.707]  Put it into the process of, you know, into the rest of the information gathering system and provide the leaders of the state the ability to make a decision which is based on reality and data.
[02:49:22.707 --> 02:49:38.040]  The Mossad had a tendency to feel that, you know, politicians come and go, we can't rely on them to make the proper decisions, so therefore we will tailor the information in a way that will cause and about the results that we call for.
[02:49:39.048 --> 02:49:41.150]  You can't trust the Arabs.
[02:49:41.150 --> 02:49:42.532]  There's never going to be peace.
[02:49:42.532 --> 02:49:44.073]  The Palestinians have no intention.
[02:49:44.073 --> 02:49:45.795]  And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:49:45.795 --> 02:49:48.398]  All intelligence agencies have been caught doing that.
[02:49:48.398 --> 02:49:48.998]  Absolutely.
[02:49:48.998 --> 02:49:53.403]  But, you know, not being a member of others, I can't complain about them.
[02:49:53.403 --> 02:49:56.166]  And I don't feel a responsibility that I need to.
[02:49:56.166 --> 02:49:57.948]  What type of missions did you mainly run?
[02:49:58.828 --> 02:50:01.911]  Mainly recruiting of agents.
[02:50:01.911 --> 02:50:06.374]  The difference between a case officer and an agent is that a lot of people mix it up.
[02:50:06.374 --> 02:50:18.443]  A case officer is a person who works in the field and makes contact with people of the enemy, turns them, and then sends them back into their own countries to gather information for you.
[02:50:18.443 --> 02:50:21.645]  That's what a case officer does.
[02:50:21.645 --> 02:50:24.247]  So you're like a spy master?
[02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:24.907]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:50:26.028 --> 02:50:28.029]  Yeah, no way.
[02:50:28.029 --> 02:50:30.491]  It's more kind of a handler.
[02:50:30.491 --> 02:50:38.657]  And I was more on the side of the actual... And that's a point you made in the Washington Post that guaranteed Israeli intelligence is all over Turkey.
[02:50:38.657 --> 02:50:40.678]  They had people on probably all those ships.
[02:50:40.678 --> 02:50:41.859]  No question about that.
[02:50:41.859 --> 02:50:50.284]  In fact, the question that arises today about this screw-up is, which intelligence was wrong here?
[02:50:50.284 --> 02:50:55.388]  If Mossad did not provide the intelligence to the naval intelligence, then it's Mossad's fault.
[02:50:55.708 --> 02:50:56.188]  Well, stay there.
[02:50:56.188 --> 02:51:01.071]  Let's talk about that when we come back, and we'll take some phone calls with our guest.

[02:52:01.061 --> 02:52:06.023]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.023 --> 02:52:06.803]  What have we got?
[02:52:06.803 --> 02:52:09.464]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.464 --> 02:52:10.484]  A republic.
[02:52:10.484 --> 02:52:13.125]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.125 --> 02:52:15.385]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.385 --> 02:52:17.406]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.406 --> 02:52:19.087]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.087 --> 02:52:20.407]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.407 --> 02:52:21.007]  Children?
[02:52:21.007 --> 02:52:22.128]  Our education?
[02:52:22.128 --> 02:52:22.968]  Our money?
[02:52:22.968 --> 02:52:26.629]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:26.989 --> 02:52:30.673]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:30.673 --> 02:52:31.954]  You are being warned!
[02:52:31.954 --> 02:52:32.975]  We have the facts.
[02:52:32.975 --> 02:52:34.136]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.136 --> 02:52:35.057]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.057 --> 02:52:35.938]  We have common law.
[02:52:35.938 --> 02:52:38.460]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:53:04.497 --> 02:53:06.798]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?

[02:53:07.658 --> 02:53:11.100]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[02:53:39.177 --> 02:53:40.598]  What have you got to lose?

[02:53:52.208 --> 02:53:52.248]  800-822-1291.
[02:54:24.198 --> 02:54:25.339]  This happens sometimes.
[02:54:25.339 --> 02:54:29.184]  I'm doing so much during the breaks that I forget the question I asked before the break.
[02:54:29.184 --> 02:54:35.451]  Maybe when we take a few calls, they can give us what that question was.
[02:54:35.451 --> 02:54:38.554]  But Victor Ostrowski is our guest.
[02:54:38.554 --> 02:54:40.636]  TheBookPatch.com is one of his websites.
[02:54:41.417 --> 02:54:45.079]  And we're here discussing the situation the world's in.
[02:54:45.079 --> 02:54:48.681]  Separately, you've got the whole North Korean peninsula with the U.S.
[02:54:48.681 --> 02:54:50.302]  aircraft carrier about to arrive.
[02:54:50.302 --> 02:54:58.006]  And I find it very curious that there's all these tensions rising globally as there's a world economic meltdown happening.
[02:54:58.006 --> 02:55:00.608]  And I go back to World War I and World War II.
[02:55:00.608 --> 02:55:03.950]  We always have wars when the planet is in a crisis.
[02:55:04.930 --> 02:55:13.155]  And I don't know if it's human instinct or if it's being orchestrated or what's happening, but looks like rough times are ahead.
[02:55:13.155 --> 02:55:17.518]  Victor, what's your take on the whole geopolitical landscape?
[02:55:17.518 --> 02:55:21.060]  That when you have problems economically, governments tend to go to war.
[02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:28.764]  I mean, it drowns out their failures and puts the focus on something more dangerous.
[02:55:28.764 --> 02:55:29.985]  It's like they said that, you know,
[02:55:30.791 --> 02:55:37.160]  The biggest solution to all economic problems would be aliens if they arrived, because then we would unite.
[02:55:39.853 --> 02:55:47.959]  Things can be solved in simple terms, but politicians have a problem that they have, you know, short-term elections.
[02:55:47.959 --> 02:55:49.140]  They have to get re-elected again.
[02:55:49.140 --> 02:55:50.982]  Well, you brought that up during a break.
[02:55:50.982 --> 02:55:53.824]  There's a lot of scandals in Israel right now.
[02:55:53.824 --> 02:56:03.471]  Maybe Netanyahu knew this would blow up, but it would have a way of unifying Israelis and is a good smokescreen.
[02:56:05.194 --> 02:56:11.096]  I think he's got a big problem with trying to solve the situation in the Middle East.
[02:56:11.096 --> 02:56:24.422]  I mean, when you have one of the chief heads of the American military go in front of Congress and say that every time an Israeli soldier shoots a Palestinian kid, you know, five
[02:56:25.203 --> 02:56:29.565]  More people join Al-Qaeda and shoot at American soldiers in Afghanistan.
[02:56:29.565 --> 02:56:34.747]  And he tied the things together, which are to be tied.
[02:56:34.747 --> 02:56:36.468]  I mean, one does relate to the other.
[02:56:36.468 --> 02:56:40.770]  I mean, we're all, so to speak, fighting the same war against terror.
[02:56:40.770 --> 02:56:46.813]  And as we're fighting it, we're creating situations that allow people to be recruited into that.
[02:56:47.473 --> 02:57:11.832]  Into that world so and we have to remember things from history I mean people are saying oh, you know we have people that are Americans that have joined Al Qaeda I know they're all so surprised, but don't forget you know you had British Heads of the intelligence who turned sides and joined the Soviets so you know you also had British British commandos who helped set up the State of Israel as well
[02:57:12.625 --> 02:57:13.585]  That's correct.
[02:57:13.585 --> 02:57:15.806]  And so did American soldiers that were there.
[02:57:15.806 --> 02:57:30.593]  But expanding on that, if you have a thousand Predator drones killing people indiscriminately, don't even have to know what their name is, because they have a gun in Afghanistan or Pakistan, that is going to create real terrorism.
[02:57:30.593 --> 02:57:32.194]  Well, the thing is this.
[02:57:32.194 --> 02:57:32.994]  Here's the thing.
[02:57:32.994 --> 02:57:37.796]  We have created these monsters, so to speak, that we can't talk to them.
[02:57:37.796 --> 02:57:39.817]  And if you can't talk to them, then you have to kill them.
[02:57:40.516 --> 02:57:44.605]  Uh, and they're saying, well, if you have to kill me, I'm going to fight back.
[02:57:44.605 --> 02:57:50.657]  On the other hand, if you create a dialogue and you open a window and you say, wait a minute, wait a minute, you know, uh, let's not...
[02:57:52.073 --> 02:57:53.013]  Let's do it that way.
[02:57:53.013 --> 02:57:59.274]  But the military-industrial complex wants war, wants a pretext, wants weapons sales, so it's only going to get worse.
[02:57:59.274 --> 02:58:01.035]  Well, Eisenhower threatened against that.
[02:58:01.035 --> 02:58:02.115]  He warned us against that.
[02:58:02.115 --> 02:58:05.556]  He said at the time, beware of the military-industrial complex.
[02:58:05.556 --> 02:58:07.256]  And there is one, for example, in Israel.
[02:58:07.256 --> 02:58:08.456]  I know that for a fact.
[02:58:08.456 --> 02:58:10.797]  The Israeli military wants to try new weapons.
[02:58:10.797 --> 02:58:12.297]  They want to try new equipment.
[02:58:12.297 --> 02:58:14.738]  They want to make sure that things are happening.
[02:58:14.738 --> 02:58:21.199]  And that's why Mossad is part of that same game, saying, you know, we need to develop things so we can protect ourselves.
[02:58:22.401 --> 02:58:23.882]  All right, we're going to do just one more segment.
[02:58:23.882 --> 02:58:32.685]  We'll have to have you back soon, but we'll go to Free Patriot David George, a few others with quick questions for our guest, and then we'll definitely have him up sooner than, I don't know how many years.
[02:58:32.685 --> 02:58:33.765]  It might have been eight, nine years.
[02:58:33.765 --> 02:58:34.386]  I forget.
[02:58:34.386 --> 02:58:38.487]  I just remember we've had Victor on before, and he remembers it as well.
[02:58:38.487 --> 02:58:42.749]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:42.749 --> 02:58:45.350]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:02.874 --> 02:59:11.597]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[02:59:20.083 --> 02:59:24.685]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:59:24.685 --> 02:59:28.526]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:59:28.526 --> 02:59:29.746]  Others don't.
[02:59:29.746 --> 02:59:31.887]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:59:31.887 --> 02:59:33.668]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:59:33.668 --> 02:59:36.569]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:59:48.253 --> 02:59:49.133]  Others don't.
[02:59:53.812 --> 02:59:56.195]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:59:56.195 --> 03:00:02.742]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:02.742 --> 03:00:06.987]  Alright, final segment with Viktor Ostrovsky.
[03:00:06.987 --> 03:00:13.093]  We will continue with your phone calls into the final hour that we just kicked off.
[03:00:13.093 --> 03:00:14.274]  And I got a bunch of news.
[03:00:15.512 --> 03:00:22.758]  On the BP oil spill, on the economy, on what's happening in China, North Korea, it's all coming up.
[03:00:22.758 --> 03:00:31.726]  But former Mossad case officer, and he's also a Navy commander, so uniquely qualified to speak about the flotilla fiasco.
[03:00:31.726 --> 03:00:34.148]  Victor Ostrowski is our guest for about another five minutes.
[03:00:34.148 --> 03:00:38.211]  Free patriot in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:38.211 --> 03:00:40.953]  Good afternoon, gentlemen, how are you guys doing today?
[03:00:40.953 --> 03:00:41.674]  We're doing good, go ahead.
[03:00:42.925 --> 03:00:43.746]  I have a question.
[03:00:43.746 --> 03:00:46.988]  This is mainly towards Victor.
[03:00:46.988 --> 03:00:56.436]  If Israel was attacked by other nations and threatened its existence, is it still possible for Israel to initiate the Samson Option?
[03:00:57.711 --> 03:01:03.234]  Well, Israel has a nuclear capability, and I don't think they consider that.
[03:01:03.234 --> 03:01:10.078]  The assassin option is kind of like a generality that is used, which is, you know, we'll take them with us and we'll go.
[03:01:10.078 --> 03:01:13.540]  Israel has the capability of smaller nuclear weapons.
[03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:14.440]  I think so.
[03:01:34.512 --> 03:01:40.953]  Well, yeah, I mean, Iran's trying to have it enriched in Brazil, and then our own government's trying to block that.
[03:01:40.953 --> 03:01:43.254]  I mean, that fixes it right there.
[03:01:43.254 --> 03:01:44.934]  And Turkey, by the way.
[03:01:44.934 --> 03:01:48.075]  Turkey and Brazil both offered to do that.
[03:01:48.075 --> 03:01:52.576]  It's a strange thing, but yeah, they have the option.
[03:01:52.576 --> 03:02:01.438]  They have the military capability and the nuclear capability to do that, but I don't think it should be called the Samson option anymore because it's not a self-destructive element.
[03:02:03.251 --> 03:02:04.171]  I have a question for Victor.
[03:02:04.171 --> 03:02:05.832]  You had a guest on the other day, Mr. Hart, and he was talking
[03:02:26.596 --> 03:02:34.359]  The former BBC reporter, I had him on because he talked to engineers who said it was explosives and we know the buildings were blown up.
[03:02:34.359 --> 03:02:35.819]  That's a separate issue.
[03:02:35.819 --> 03:02:40.441]  And then he was saying his theory is that Al-Qaeda was going to do the attack and that
[03:02:41.081 --> 03:02:43.223]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:02:57.330 --> 03:03:03.775]  As a whole, Mossad in particular would never get involved in anything like that.
[03:03:03.775 --> 03:03:04.275]  The U.S.
[03:03:04.275 --> 03:03:05.216]  is an ally.
[03:03:05.216 --> 03:03:06.296]  We disagree on things.
[03:03:06.296 --> 03:03:08.138]  Israel disagrees with them.
[03:03:08.138 --> 03:03:11.540]  But never, ever, ever would Israel do that.
[03:03:15.484 --> 03:03:29.138]  And again, like I said, I'm not the one defending Israel or whatever, but I can tell you that categorically, that knowing the people in the Mossad, knowing a lot of friends of mine who are still working there, that would not be done.
[03:03:29.138 --> 03:03:29.818]  Ever.
[03:03:29.818 --> 03:03:31.881]  This is... Well, here's my issue.
[03:03:31.881 --> 03:03:35.744]  Government staged terror, and Israel wanted us to go into the Middle East, but
[03:03:36.721 --> 03:03:39.683]  Dick Cheney was in control of the stand-down.
[03:03:39.683 --> 03:03:49.790]  The Pentagon, NORAD, CIA drills that day, and so I see these intelligence agencies all joined at the hip.
[03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:52.752]  I know that governments are capable of anything.
[03:03:52.752 --> 03:04:04.480]  My whole issue is, and of course I expose the entire 9-11 situation, that people who think Israel did the thing all by themselves... No, I don't think Israel was involved at all.
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:04.840]  Period.
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:11.622]  What I'm saying is Israel couldn't run the attack, even if you believe that it is an inside job, which I do, Victor.
[03:04:11.622 --> 03:04:12.983]  I have the evidence.
[03:04:12.983 --> 03:04:16.204]  I'm saying Israel couldn't run the entire attack.
[03:04:16.204 --> 03:04:19.846]  Well, Israel could not have been any bit involved.
[03:04:19.846 --> 03:04:23.207]  And that would be, you know what, Israel is an open society.
[03:04:23.787 --> 03:04:24.747]  On that level.
[03:04:24.747 --> 03:04:26.208]  And they would have come out.
[03:04:26.208 --> 03:04:29.609]  And there is just no, there is no basis for that.
[03:04:29.609 --> 03:04:32.710]  And I can tell you that Israel would never, ever do that.
[03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:33.330]  Never get involved.
[03:04:33.330 --> 03:04:37.531]  Certainly you've heard all the accusations about Israel being involved.
[03:04:37.531 --> 03:04:41.432]  I've heard so many things, you know, about the kitchen sink on them.
[03:04:41.432 --> 03:04:45.733]  And I'm the first one to point out what they are involved in and what they're not from my personal knowledge.
[03:04:45.733 --> 03:04:48.934]  I can tell you that one thing I can guarantee with my life.
[03:04:48.934 --> 03:04:50.294]  And I would stake my life on that.
[03:04:50.294 --> 03:04:51.675]  And Israel had nothing to do with 9-11.
[03:04:53.183 --> 03:04:53.844]  Well, you know what, sir?
[03:04:53.844 --> 03:04:54.506]  We've got a break.
[03:04:54.506 --> 03:05:00.017]  Do a few more minutes with us under the sack, because I'm going to finish up on this discussion with our guest, Victor Ostrowski.
[03:05:00.017 --> 03:05:00.378]  Stay with us.
[03:05:04.781 --> 03:05:06.042]  Tyranny is here.
[03:05:06.042 --> 03:05:09.925]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:05:09.925 --> 03:05:12.207]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:05:12.207 --> 03:05:18.092]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:05:18.092 --> 03:05:24.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:05:24.737 --> 03:05:30.721]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:05:30.721 --> 03:05:34.904]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:05:34.904 --> 03:05:39.187]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:05:39.187 --> 03:05:45.132]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:05:45.132 --> 03:05:48.694]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:05:48.694 --> 03:05:50.675]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:05:50.675 --> 03:05:51.116]  It's here.

[03:06:01.103 --> 03:06:04.105]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.105 --> 03:06:09.449]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.449 --> 03:06:11.490]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.490 --> 03:06:16.494]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.494 --> 03:06:17.674]  How much do you want?
[03:06:17.674 --> 03:06:18.415]  When do you want it?
[03:06:18.775 --> 03:06:20.657]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:20.657 --> 03:06:21.738]  When will you need it?
[03:06:21.738 --> 03:06:23.941]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:23.941 --> 03:06:25.282]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.282 --> 03:06:26.804]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:26.804 --> 03:06:32.089]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.089 --> 03:06:35.673]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:35.673 --> 03:06:39.137]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.477 --> 03:06:40.698]  How much will you need?
[03:06:40.698 --> 03:06:41.599]  We don't know.
[03:06:41.599 --> 03:06:42.720]  How much do you want?
[03:06:42.720 --> 03:06:43.641]  All you can get.
[03:06:43.641 --> 03:06:44.742]  I'm Alex Jones.

[03:08:04.492 --> 03:08:07.835]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:11.363 --> 03:08:13.665]  Victor Ostrowski is our guest.
[03:08:13.665 --> 03:08:19.669]  The website is TheBookPatch.com or OstrowskiFineArt.com.
[03:08:19.669 --> 03:08:25.813]  A former naval commander and then a Mossad commander, case officer, handler, spy master, whatever you want to call it.
[03:08:28.410 --> 03:08:31.573]  I was talking to him during the break and I said, look, I think Israel does corrupt bad things.
[03:08:31.573 --> 03:08:32.894]  They've been caught doing false flags.
[03:08:32.894 --> 03:08:34.816]  You know, you've talked about it.
[03:08:34.816 --> 03:08:37.338]  And I said, I don't think Israel could carry out 9-11.
[03:08:37.338 --> 03:08:39.701]  And he said, well, Israel didn't do it.
[03:08:39.701 --> 03:08:40.501]  I can tell you that.
[03:08:40.501 --> 03:08:42.323]  But they sure could carry it out.
[03:08:42.323 --> 03:08:44.085]  So, whoa, he's got my attention there.
[03:08:44.085 --> 03:08:48.809]  I want to hear what he has to say on that subject.
[03:08:48.809 --> 03:08:51.432]  And I'm glad that the caller brought up that point.
[03:08:51.432 --> 03:08:53.534]  So, Victor, please enlighten me.
[03:08:53.974 --> 03:08:55.555]  Well, anybody could do it.
[03:08:55.555 --> 03:08:57.296]  It was a very simple operation.
[03:08:57.296 --> 03:08:58.596]  The point was this.
[03:08:58.596 --> 03:09:08.422]  The operation that the Al Qaeda carried out in taking out the buildings at 9-11 and doing this whole attack was based on a simple, basic thing.
[03:09:08.422 --> 03:09:10.983]  And the basic thing was that you were defenseless.
[03:09:11.423 --> 03:09:12.583]  You stood there.
[03:09:12.583 --> 03:09:14.604]  You had no expectations of it.
[03:09:14.604 --> 03:09:17.765]  You didn't have any system to protect you against it.
[03:09:17.765 --> 03:09:21.266]  You did not take any measures to stop anything like that.
[03:09:21.266 --> 03:09:23.486]  You were not even thinking in that direction.
[03:09:23.486 --> 03:09:29.848]  You had a whole system that was built and designed to fight the Soviet Union and to fight other, you know, countries.
[03:09:30.388 --> 03:09:35.053]  And here comes a small organization, relatively small, that had trained in the U.S.
[03:09:35.053 --> 03:09:37.456]  to fly planes, gets onto an airplane.
[03:09:37.456 --> 03:09:40.820]  You did not have a locked door between the front and the back.
[03:09:40.820 --> 03:09:48.007]  You know, you go onto any allowed plane and this one... No, no, I understand, Victor, but what I'm saying is, I mean, you're looking at this from the way it's projected at us.
[03:09:48.007 --> 03:09:50.610]  I'm looking at what, you know, the evidence shows happened on 9-11.
[03:09:51.691 --> 03:10:02.460]  The point is, does Israel have... I mean, technically, then you're saying a group of Israelis could have gone on, taken over... A group of, you know what, let's put it this way, a group of Kurds could have done it.
[03:10:02.460 --> 03:10:06.123]  No, I know, but I mean, Israel doesn't have suicide operators.
[03:10:06.123 --> 03:10:06.644]  You know what?
[03:10:07.384 --> 03:10:16.135]  First of all, every country at its own time had somebody who, you know, I mean, the first suicide bomber was, you know, was Israeli in a way.
[03:10:16.135 --> 03:10:18.918]  I mean, Samson said, may I die with a Philistine.
[03:10:18.918 --> 03:10:21.100]  So, you know, it started somewhere.
[03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:26.146]  But the point of it is that to carry out such an operation,
[03:10:26.887 --> 03:10:28.948]  You don't need much.
[03:10:28.948 --> 03:10:45.031]  And to say that you have to have a whole system in place, when you're talking about, you know, NORAD or whatever, you're talking about some civilian airplanes that are flying in the air out of their lock when nobody at the time was thinking about that being done and that an airplane could actually be used.
[03:10:45.031 --> 03:10:46.751]  Okay, let's go over this briefly.
[03:10:46.751 --> 03:10:53.193]  I mean, let me tell you then, and I can send you all this if you want it, because I don't expect everybody to be aware of everything going on.
[03:10:54.093 --> 03:11:21.972]  It is confirmed, Colonel Stephen Butler at the Defense Language School of Monterey, California, AP, San Jose Mercury News, and I talked to him on the phone, it is confirmed in Newsweek, everywhere, that these guys, I've interviewed Springman, the head of the Visa Division, they were ordered to let them in, they were told their terror list is only their cover, they work for us, the CIA was running a drill that day.
[03:11:21.972 --> 03:11:23.833]  They didn't have a terror list at the time.
[03:11:25.354 --> 03:11:26.774]  Oh yeah, the CIA did!
[03:11:26.774 --> 03:11:29.136]  The CIA did with the State Department!
[03:11:29.136 --> 03:11:31.017]  Yeah, you know what?
[03:11:31.017 --> 03:11:32.297]  I'll make a deal with you.
[03:11:32.297 --> 03:11:35.559]  You see, I'm in total disagreement with you.
[03:11:35.559 --> 03:11:36.159]  Okay?
[03:11:36.159 --> 03:11:37.660]  And I'm allowed to do that.
[03:11:37.660 --> 03:11:41.082]  I mean, you're the first guy who will say that I'm allowed to have a different opinion than you.
[03:11:41.082 --> 03:11:42.122]  Sure, yeah.
[03:11:42.122 --> 03:11:43.803]  I'm saying, okay, you got my email.
[03:11:43.803 --> 03:11:44.843]  Send me this stuff.
[03:11:44.843 --> 03:11:45.904]  Let me look at it.
[03:11:45.904 --> 03:11:48.305]  I'll come back and I'll kill my opinion.
[03:11:48.305 --> 03:11:49.726]  I may tear everything you say down.
[03:11:51.038 --> 03:11:57.943]  Well, I mean, NORAD did stand down, and we do have the tapes of them saying, what's this exercise stuff on my screen?
[03:11:57.943 --> 03:11:59.063]  Absolutely!
[03:11:59.063 --> 03:12:00.785]  It makes absolute sense!
[03:12:00.785 --> 03:12:04.327]  You know, if that's the case, and if that's there, yeah!
[03:12:04.327 --> 03:12:06.168]  Why would they think differently?
[03:12:06.168 --> 03:12:07.389]  It's not been done before.
[03:12:07.389 --> 03:12:08.010]  You know what?
[03:12:08.010 --> 03:12:16.055]  I was on a radio show when my book came out, By Way of Deception, and I was arguing that, you know, some people are defending Israel's acts
[03:12:17.197 --> 03:12:24.029]  And I said what would happen one day if somebody walks up to you at 30,000 feet and puts a gun to your head and says show me your passport?
[03:12:24.767 --> 03:12:32.612]  Now, do you want to have a passport that has a total agreement with everything Israel does, or do you want to have somebody that actually stood up and said something?
[03:12:32.612 --> 03:12:39.456]  So, this was not something that was not on the minds of people in intelligence services around the world.
[03:12:39.456 --> 03:12:47.621]  Israel did not put steel doors in the airplanes because they thought it would be better for the pilots because, you know, women wanted to get to them.
[03:12:48.262 --> 03:12:49.865]  There was a reason for that.
[03:12:49.865 --> 03:12:51.328]  We all knew that.
[03:12:51.328 --> 03:12:57.260]  America decided not to take action, not to protect itself, because it was too costly.
[03:12:58.208 --> 03:12:59.829]  Because it would take too much money.
[03:12:59.829 --> 03:13:00.870]  Let me expand on that.
[03:13:00.870 --> 03:13:04.012]  I mean, they've got naked body scanners in to teach us how to submit.
[03:13:04.012 --> 03:13:05.052]  Now they do.
[03:13:05.052 --> 03:13:05.593]  Now they do.
[03:13:05.593 --> 03:13:07.754]  To teach us how to submit to tyranny.
[03:13:07.754 --> 03:13:08.635]  Look, look.
[03:13:08.635 --> 03:13:09.875]  The Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[03:13:09.875 --> 03:13:10.976]  That's now declassified.
[03:13:10.976 --> 03:13:21.023]  I've got the army training manuals for captains in black ops that have been leaked, which the government admits are real, where they teach our army captains how to stage terror attacks.
[03:13:21.023 --> 03:13:23.464]  Now, are you, I mean, you know about false flag.
[03:13:23.464 --> 03:13:24.525]  You talk about Israel running.
[03:13:24.525 --> 03:13:25.305]  Absolutely.
[03:13:25.305 --> 03:13:27.387]  So what I'm telling you is, look.
[03:13:28.127 --> 03:13:35.774]  Now to be clear what you said during the break though, I mean have you looked at the information about 9-11 having evidence of false flag?
[03:13:35.774 --> 03:13:37.195]  No.
[03:13:37.195 --> 03:13:44.841]  Are you aware that there are police and firemen saying get back they're blowing up building 7 and that BBC reported building 7 had fallen 25 minutes before it fell?
[03:13:44.841 --> 03:13:46.623]  No.
[03:13:46.623 --> 03:13:48.725]  No, I'm telling you right now, no.
[03:13:49.486 --> 03:13:50.087]  I don't.
[03:13:50.087 --> 03:14:01.075]  But you see, either I've been brainwashed, or whatever you want to call it, but I don't believe that the American government, I don't believe that the Israeli government, I don't believe that, I don't believe that.
[03:14:01.075 --> 03:14:08.501]  Now, I think it's rogue networks, rogue networks within the government structures, working together.
[03:14:08.501 --> 03:14:10.422]  Look, I mean, Cheney... What would be the point?
[03:14:10.422 --> 03:14:14.365]  All right, PNAC, Project for an American Century, September 20th, 2000, said,
[03:14:16.707 --> 03:14:23.670]  Minus a huge Pearl Harbor catalyzing event, we're not going to be able to launch our Pax Americana world government.
[03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:25.650]  We need a giant stage terror attack.
[03:14:25.650 --> 03:14:28.151]  We need a terror attack.
[03:14:28.151 --> 03:14:31.973]  You know, you know where all this has a problem?
[03:14:31.973 --> 03:14:38.115]  Where I find a problem with the American government supposedly trying to take over everything?
[03:14:38.115 --> 03:14:41.977]  If we did, we wouldn't be in such a big debt to China.
[03:14:41.977 --> 03:14:45.198]  I mean, look at the situation we're in today.
[03:14:46.090 --> 03:14:49.354]  The situation is not of a world leader.
[03:14:49.354 --> 03:15:00.328]  The situation we're in today, you know, is a nation almost at its knees economically to a world that it gave open access to everything it has.
[03:15:00.328 --> 03:15:03.552]  If you think there's a problem here, I'll tell you what I think the problem here.
[03:15:03.832 --> 03:15:06.473]  I think the problem here is that we have no tariffs.
[03:15:06.473 --> 03:15:13.135]  I think that anybody can come to this country, sell whatever they want, whatever price they want, and we cannot go back and sell to them.
[03:15:13.135 --> 03:15:14.335]  No, I agree, but that's globalization.
[03:15:14.335 --> 03:15:17.696]  We were the globalists who used America to build its empire.
[03:15:17.696 --> 03:15:22.717]  Now they've set us up as the boogeyman, and they're going to basically chop us down like wheat in the autumn.
[03:15:22.717 --> 03:15:25.478]  Victor Ostrowski, I really appreciate you joining us.
[03:15:26.138 --> 03:15:26.578]  Anytime you want.
[03:15:26.578 --> 03:15:27.159]  It's been a pleasure.
[03:15:27.159 --> 03:15:27.459]  Thank you.
[03:15:53.254 --> 03:15:56.876]  So we've had people on that believe Israel is the source of all evil.
[03:15:56.876 --> 03:16:00.917]  We've had people on who basically love Israel and think it can't do much wrong.
[03:16:00.917 --> 03:16:04.039]  We've had people on kind of in the middle of the road like Victor.
[03:16:04.039 --> 03:16:08.981]  So we're trying to give a wide view to this as I try to decipher what's going on here for myself.
[03:16:08.981 --> 03:16:11.702]  You know, like I've always said, I can't tell right away what's going on.
[03:16:13.683 --> 03:16:15.424]  But give me time, I can tell you.
[03:16:15.424 --> 03:16:20.186]  Just like day one, I said, look staged with the underwear bomber on Christmas.
[03:16:20.186 --> 03:16:26.189]  And within a month, we knew the State Department was ordered to let him on and protected him, and that was staged.
[03:16:26.189 --> 03:16:33.693]  And I'm not sure yet, but I'm getting more and more there that BP was a staged deal to pass carbon taxes.
[03:16:33.693 --> 03:16:39.195]  And now we find out that the stock was dumped by Goldman Sachs two days before at a record low.
[03:16:41.741 --> 03:17:04.514]  I know how this system works, and I think even intelligent people like Victor, they look at it in a two-dimensional way, but I'm looking at it in a, not even a three-dimensional or four-dimensional, but a fifth-dimensional, you know, all these different angles and compartments and, you know, dimensions to it, you know, to really get that full-spectrum analysis.
[03:17:04.514 --> 03:17:08.376]  That's how we're able to predict things so accurately here on the show.
[03:17:15.089 --> 03:17:16.350]  It's mind-boggling.
[03:17:16.350 --> 03:17:20.311]  Look, I'm going to go to your calls in a bunch of news, but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[03:17:20.311 --> 03:17:24.093]  He hasn't been on in a while, and gold has been way up in the last week.
[03:17:24.093 --> 03:17:26.173]  Record levels in Europe.
[03:17:26.173 --> 03:17:27.014]  Record levels here.
[03:17:27.014 --> 03:17:30.055]  Premiums on gold coin surge.
[03:17:30.055 --> 03:17:32.756]  This is out of International Business Times.
[03:17:32.756 --> 03:17:37.158]  Despite the rising prices of gold, physical demand for the yellow metal continues to surge.
[03:17:38.218 --> 03:17:46.749]  Uh, physical demand for gold is robust and premiums on gold coins continue to rise in key bullion markets in London, Dubai, Mumbai, New York, and Beijing.
[03:17:46.749 --> 03:17:51.755]  According to the analysts for Goldcore, premiums on British gold sovereigns have increased from 3% to 7%.
[03:17:53.860 --> 03:18:02.783]  In just one month, on British sovereigns and British investors buy the coins as they do, and then it just goes on from there.
[03:18:02.783 --> 03:18:08.005]  And so I want to point out, Ted keeps buying gold when it's low, selling it when it's high, at the old price.
[03:18:08.005 --> 03:18:13.047]  And he's run out of almost everything at, you know, the price when gold was $70, $80 lower.
[03:18:13.047 --> 03:18:18.029]  But he's still got a little bit, and then he bought other coins as it was going up that are still the best deals you're going to find.
[03:18:18.029 --> 03:18:22.631]  I mean, I use the example of, I've seen one of the biggest gold companies selling francs
[03:18:23.912 --> 03:18:26.354]  Uh, European francs, fifth of an ounce for 360.
[03:18:26.354 --> 03:18:30.878]  And Ted last week, what was, they were 250 something.
[03:18:30.878 --> 03:18:35.021]  I mean, Ted's losing money in this market if he bought them now.
[03:18:35.021 --> 03:18:38.565]  Uh, so there's always a premium, but you can forget the premium.
[03:18:38.565 --> 03:18:42.448]  You can forget, you know, even bullion prices with these deals.
[03:18:42.448 --> 03:18:46.832]  So briefly, Ted, what do you have right now for people that's available?
[03:18:46.832 --> 03:18:50.115]  Because most coin shops are sold out or there's giant premiums.
[03:18:50.660 --> 03:18:56.262]  Well, like you said, Alex, the best thing that I have going on right now is the Frank coin at $256.68.
[03:18:56.262 --> 03:19:05.646]  Now, if you buy that coin from us, you're going to get a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's International Forecaster, too.
[03:19:05.646 --> 03:19:10.688]  Yeah, but even if people have already got the free forecaster, which is twice a week and a great value, that isn't what matters.
[03:19:10.688 --> 03:19:14.490]  That $256 per fifth of an ounce, Frank, that's a really good deal.
[03:19:15.210 --> 03:19:18.273]  It's as good as it gets across the entire globe.
[03:19:18.273 --> 03:19:20.214]  And you're right about the British sovereigns, too.
[03:19:20.214 --> 03:19:22.176]  The premiums have shot up in them.
[03:19:22.176 --> 03:19:26.079]  The supplies are so thin that I don't even sell them right now.
[03:19:26.079 --> 03:19:31.203]  I'm not keeping stock because... 800-686-2237.
[03:19:31.203 --> 03:19:34.386]  800-686-2237.
[03:19:34.386 --> 03:19:35.647]  Folks, don't screw around.
[03:19:35.647 --> 03:19:36.427]  Call up.
[03:19:36.427 --> 03:19:37.508]  Fifth of an ounce, Franks.
[03:19:37.508 --> 03:19:39.910]  That's what I've been buying the last few years.
[03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:40.571]  Really great deal.
[03:19:41.031 --> 03:19:42.071]  But briefly, gentlemen, come back.
[03:19:42.071 --> 03:19:45.913]  Tell us about some of the other coin offers you've got that are also excellent deals.
[03:19:45.913 --> 03:19:53.656]  Folks, you're not going to find Franks any less than this, and you're probably not going to be able to find them this low.
[03:19:53.656 --> 03:19:55.396]  Plus, it's a Patriot organization.
[03:19:55.396 --> 03:19:58.197]  They've got them on hand, ready to ship to you right now.
[03:19:58.197 --> 03:19:58.918]  We'll be back.
[03:19:58.918 --> 03:19:59.378]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.363 --> 03:20:06.324]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:20:06.324 --> 03:20:07.324]  What have we got?
[03:20:07.324 --> 03:20:09.765]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:20:09.765 --> 03:20:10.785]  A republic.
[03:20:10.785 --> 03:20:13.425]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:20:13.425 --> 03:20:15.686]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:20:15.686 --> 03:20:17.706]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:20:17.706 --> 03:20:19.387]  So they think they own our land?
[03:20:19.387 --> 03:20:20.707]  They think they own our water?
[03:20:20.707 --> 03:20:21.327]  Children?
[03:20:21.327 --> 03:20:22.447]  Our education?
[03:20:22.447 --> 03:20:23.267]  Our money?
[03:20:23.267 --> 03:20:26.908]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:20:27.299 --> 03:20:30.983]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:20:30.983 --> 03:20:32.264]  You're being warned!
[03:20:32.264 --> 03:20:33.285]  We have the facts.
[03:20:33.285 --> 03:20:34.446]  We have the Constitution.
[03:20:34.446 --> 03:20:35.367]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:20:35.367 --> 03:20:36.248]  We have common law.
[03:20:36.248 --> 03:20:38.770]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:38.770 --> 03:20:42.654]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:20:42.654 --> 03:20:47.618]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:20:47.618 --> 03:20:49.120]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[03:20:49.120 --> 03:20:50.201]  Don't Tread on Me.

[03:21:04.988 --> 03:21:06.368]  There is a difference.

[03:21:51.473 --> 03:21:53.115]  Or call TacTownGear at 418-844-9111.
[03:21:53.115 --> 03:21:53.776]  Again, that's 418-844-9111.
[03:22:00.973 --> 03:22:03.915]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:22:03.915 --> 03:22:08.097]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[03:22:08.097 --> 03:22:10.358]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:10.358 --> 03:22:15.521]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:22:15.521 --> 03:22:17.342]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:22:17.342 --> 03:22:18.643]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:22:18.863 --> 03:22:20.364]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:22:20.364 --> 03:22:23.726]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:22:23.726 --> 03:22:29.109]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:22:29.109 --> 03:22:38.194]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[03:22:38.434 --> 03:22:43.617]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:43.617 --> 03:22:47.100]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.
[03:22:47.100 --> 03:22:50.902]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.902 --> 03:22:53.023]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[03:22:53.023 --> 03:22:53.184]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.092 --> 03:23:04.094]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:04.094 --> 03:23:09.436]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:09.436 --> 03:23:11.477]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:11.477 --> 03:23:16.480]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:16.480 --> 03:23:16.760]  How much
[03:23:16.800 --> 03:23:16.960]  I think?
[03:23:37.299 --> 03:23:37.640]  I don't know.
[03:24:04.696 --> 03:24:10.380]  By the way, I talked to Jim Tucker, the granddaddy of the Bilderberg sleuths, and there wasn't a point to get him on today.
[03:24:10.380 --> 03:24:12.402]  He said he hadn't gotten any intel yet.
[03:24:12.402 --> 03:24:19.126]  But he should have it tomorrow, if not by Sunday, from the global government meeting going on in Spain.
[03:24:19.126 --> 03:24:20.727]  So look for that tomorrow.
[03:24:20.727 --> 03:24:27.732]  I've got a key announcement coming up after the next break, and I'm going to blitz through some news, and I promise get to all the phone callers that are patiently holding 1-800-259-9231.
[03:24:27.732 --> 03:24:27.893]  But Ted,
[03:24:32.876 --> 03:24:47.781]  I've got some mainstream articles here today that explain that you've got bankrupt countries bailing out bankrupt countries, and then they bail out the other bankrupt countries, but the private bankers are issuing all this currency and credit out of nothing.
[03:24:47.781 --> 03:24:51.242]  They're getting real assets in return.
[03:24:51.242 --> 03:24:59.444]  There's a method to this madness, and you notice Greece goes down, and then Spain, and now France, and England, and Iceland, and it's just getting worse and worse.
[03:24:59.444 --> 03:25:01.965]  The jobless number's up, more factories shutting down.
[03:25:03.005 --> 03:25:05.547]  You've got the situation with Mercury.
[03:25:05.547 --> 03:25:08.869]  Not going to be able to buy Mercury anymore, folks.
[03:25:08.869 --> 03:25:11.330]  The government runs GM.
[03:25:11.330 --> 03:25:13.011]  They want us dependent.
[03:25:13.011 --> 03:25:20.195]  And there's no silver bullet to save anybody in this, except take the states back, take our government back, get a true fiscal responsibility.
[03:25:20.195 --> 03:25:24.218]  But as a stopgap measure to protect yourselves, I don't buy gold and silver as an investment.
[03:25:24.798 --> 03:25:30.160]  Though I started buying gold when it was $265 or so an ounce, and I still buy it when it's $1,200.
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:35.541]  And I don't sell it when it goes up to quote, take a profit.
[03:25:35.541 --> 03:25:40.243]  It's an emergency backup against total depression, just like storable food or firearms.
[03:25:40.243 --> 03:25:41.703]  And it's not that I'm living in fear.
[03:25:41.703 --> 03:25:42.583]  Oh no!
[03:25:42.583 --> 03:25:43.864]  I'm living in control!
[03:25:44.764 --> 03:25:46.245]  Just like the old timers.
[03:25:46.245 --> 03:25:51.148]  Just like the grasshopper doesn't store stuff during the summer, the ant does.
[03:25:51.148 --> 03:25:54.410]  The ant lives through the winter, the grasshopper dies.
[03:25:54.410 --> 03:25:59.173]  And a lot of people are buying gold right now as an investment.
[03:25:59.173 --> 03:26:02.274]  Look, the point is, and people only buy when it's going up.
[03:26:02.274 --> 03:26:02.755]  It's crazy.
[03:26:02.755 --> 03:26:06.497]  Well, with TED, you can get in a time machine and go back and get a better deal on it.
[03:26:06.497 --> 03:26:09.419]  Again, $256 per franc.
[03:26:09.419 --> 03:26:11.700]  I wouldn't buy just one and then get a free newsletter.
[03:26:11.700 --> 03:26:13.241]  That's a great way to stick your toe in.
[03:26:13.801 --> 03:26:18.826]  I would, you know, move substantively in it if I was you, but that's what I would do personally.
[03:26:18.826 --> 03:26:26.393]  Ted, briefly, what are some of the other coin offers you've got in other gold coins you've got on hand, silver coins, some of the other smoking deals you've got?
[03:26:26.943 --> 03:26:30.566]  Well, the Walking Liberty half at $9.75 is a great buy.
[03:26:30.566 --> 03:26:32.288]  I mean, we have Eagles, U.S.
[03:26:32.288 --> 03:26:33.048]  Eagles.
[03:26:33.048 --> 03:26:33.989]  We have Krugerrands.
[03:26:33.989 --> 03:26:35.030]  We have Maple Leafs.
[03:26:35.030 --> 03:26:37.813]  I mean, we have bags of junk silver.
[03:26:37.813 --> 03:26:41.736]  I saw an article about runs on Krugerrands the last two weeks in Deutschland.
[03:26:41.736 --> 03:26:48.542]  You know, their output right now, the Krugerrand has put out, it's at a 25-year high and they can't keep up with demand.
[03:26:48.542 --> 03:26:51.785]  The British sovereigns have been sopped up and taken right out of the marketplace.
[03:26:52.145 --> 03:26:54.809]  The Franks are falling short behind that right now.
[03:26:54.809 --> 03:26:58.895]  The Europeans, who normally don't buy gold, are buying it hands down.
[03:26:58.895 --> 03:27:03.962]  I mean, they can't get enough of it because they're watching their nations... And we've always talked about this.
[03:27:03.962 --> 03:27:08.248]  You've got maybe 1% of the population that buys gold to physically hold it.
[03:27:08.789 --> 03:27:11.670]  It was less than half a percent just two years ago.
[03:27:11.670 --> 03:27:14.071]  It's about to be 2, 3, 4 percent in the West.
[03:27:14.071 --> 03:27:16.972]  It's already more than 50 percent in India or China.
[03:27:16.972 --> 03:27:22.054]  As the yuppies figure out that paper is dangerous, you're not going to be able to find gold, folks.
[03:27:22.054 --> 03:27:24.755]  I mean, it's already happening.
[03:27:24.755 --> 03:27:25.815]  I don't know how to say it, Ted.
[03:27:25.815 --> 03:27:29.156]  I mean, I was telling them seven years ago, at $265 to get into it, are they going to listen now?
[03:27:32.216 --> 03:27:33.317]  Well, I sure hope so.
[03:27:33.317 --> 03:27:39.561]  I mean, if they're sitting in the stock market, bond market, if they have annuities, if they're sitting with money in the bank, I mean, you name it.
[03:27:39.561 --> 03:27:46.606]  Just anything you can think of, even the real estate market, has been incredibly volatile because of all the debt associated to it.
[03:27:46.606 --> 03:27:48.728]  You just simply can't get away from the fact
[03:27:49.028 --> 03:27:49.368]  We're good to go.
[03:28:07.519 --> 03:28:20.512]  And I just need to say, if you're sitting in the stock market, bond market, whatever it is, if you have a paper asset, you better start considering gold and silver, because it's going to be one of the few things that will hold value, including your home.
[03:28:20.512 --> 03:28:26.858]  Well, it's like Mark Twain said, he wasn't interested in a return on his money, but just to be able to keep something.
[03:28:29.381 --> 03:28:33.702]  Again, I'm not getting into gold and silver for an investment.
[03:28:33.702 --> 03:28:36.023]  I'm doing it as an emergency backup, but it is.
[03:28:36.023 --> 03:28:40.925]  Is there any investment, Ted, that's done as well as metals in the last seven years?
[03:28:40.925 --> 03:28:45.206]  Well, not even in the last seven years, and go all the way back to 6,000 years.
[03:28:45.206 --> 03:28:53.148]  The only time that paper investments did well was from about 1980 through about 1999, right in that time frame.
[03:28:53.148 --> 03:28:58.130]  Otherwise, gold and silver has always produced more than the paper investments do.
[03:28:58.610 --> 03:29:05.755]  And of course that 20 years of artificial boom is now designed to sink us as we plunge into world government.
[03:29:05.755 --> 03:29:07.397]  What are your silver half dollars at?
[03:29:07.397 --> 03:29:09.298]  I know that was one of the best deals I heard you do.
[03:29:09.298 --> 03:29:10.519]  Oh, that's a really good buy.
[03:29:10.519 --> 03:29:13.942]  The silver half dollars right now are at $9.75 apiece.
[03:29:13.942 --> 03:29:15.102]  You just can't beat it.
[03:29:15.102 --> 03:29:17.084]  It's a great way to get into silver.
[03:29:17.084 --> 03:29:22.348]  It's private, portable, plus also exempt from that 60-45 revenue ruling which was
[03:29:22.788 --> 03:29:25.049]  Introduced in 1983, Pastor, 1983.
[03:29:25.049 --> 03:29:37.953]  Well, well, I mean, I mean, I mean, to be clear, tell them Alex Jones sent you, or the prices will be a little higher, they're still great deals, but to get these specials, it's the radio special with Alex Jones, so you make sure, say, no, that's the deal I want.
[03:29:37.953 --> 03:29:41.654]  Okay, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, you can ask them about some of the other specials they've got as well, 800-686-2237.
[03:29:41.654 --> 03:29:43.835]  We'll be back with the news.
[03:29:51.497 --> 03:29:55.418]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.418 --> 03:30:00.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.780 --> 03:30:03.101]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:30:03.101 --> 03:30:05.482]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:30:05.482 --> 03:30:08.703]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:30:08.703 --> 03:30:13.805]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:30:13.805 --> 03:30:18.006]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:30:18.306 --> 03:30:20.649]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:30:20.649 --> 03:30:23.533]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:30:23.533 --> 03:30:26.456]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:30:26.456 --> 03:30:34.066]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:39.794]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:30:39.794 --> 03:30:42.636]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:30:42.636 --> 03:30:46.319]  So it's going to be an inter-ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:30:46.319 --> 03:30:47.400]  And I got news for you.
[03:30:47.400 --> 03:30:48.741]  You're everyone else.
[03:30:48.741 --> 03:30:50.243]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:00.762 --> 03:32:09.770]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[03:32:09.770 --> 03:32:13.333]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?

[03:33:23.486 --> 03:33:27.972]  Oh Smokey's got his ears on.
[03:33:27.972 --> 03:33:32.479]  Let it all hang out cause we got a run to make.
[03:33:32.479 --> 03:33:34.842]  I love the final piece of the song.
[03:33:39.821 --> 03:33:47.206]  Well, Smokey's got his ears on and he's hot on your trail and he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[03:33:47.206 --> 03:34:00.774]  Okay, I've got some news I want to hit, but I also want to go to your phone calls, George, Sam, Tim, Charlie, Mike, on a host of issues that folks want to discuss here today in the last hour.
[03:34:00.774 --> 03:34:03.215]  But before I do that, I want to make an announcement.
[03:34:03.215 --> 03:34:06.658]  As you know, for two years, I have been working
[03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:09.011]  All right.
[03:34:24.537 --> 03:34:32.083]  Documentary dealing with all the different ways, or some of the main ways, that the establishment is poisoning us.
[03:34:32.083 --> 03:34:37.948]  That the establishment is toxifying our food, our water, our medicines, our air.
[03:34:37.948 --> 03:34:50.278]  And the reason I'm now making the Chemtrail film is in the last two years, government's gone from denying that they're doing these aerosol spray campaigns to admitting it, but putting a spin on it.
[03:34:50.278 --> 03:34:52.060]  And we have lots of footage of Chemtrails.
[03:34:54.755 --> 03:35:02.501]  But, we're going to be done with this in about two months, and it takes a month or so to get it packaged, ready, you know, mastered, completed.
[03:35:02.501 --> 03:35:06.864]  So it should be out in, you know, October or so.
[03:35:06.864 --> 03:35:11.347]  But, making the film, I do want to get some more of the activist in it.
[03:35:12.842 --> 03:35:13.142]  I think so.
[03:35:29.878 --> 03:35:30.238]  I don't know.
[03:35:50.812 --> 03:35:51.333]  I don't
[03:36:10.114 --> 03:36:11.715]  A month, maybe a month and a half.
[03:36:11.715 --> 03:36:13.215]  Because I have limited staff.
[03:36:13.215 --> 03:36:17.817]  We've got to get your video and watch it, and then make sure you've given us authorization to use it.
[03:36:17.817 --> 03:36:26.780]  Basically just send a letter saying, you know, I give you full authorization in the known universe through this limited license to use this however you see fit, but I retain, you know, the right to use it however I want.
[03:36:26.780 --> 03:36:28.240]  And your name, Billy Bob, in the footage.
[03:36:29.781 --> 03:36:31.082]  Then we can use it.
[03:36:31.082 --> 03:36:40.286]  But more than just chemtrails, because we've got a lot of that, but I also want to be able to show it in different parts of the country and show a map and say this person shot this here, this person shot that there.
[03:36:40.286 --> 03:36:45.169]  If you don't want your name used, put that in the letter, just authorize us to use it.
[03:36:45.169 --> 03:36:49.051]  And again, I'm not saying I can use everything I've sent, but if you've got chemtrail footage you've shot,
[03:36:49.871 --> 03:36:56.096]  Set up a camera and talk about the footage you're sending us, along with the footage.
[03:36:56.096 --> 03:37:00.799]  Don't send us your originals, because we get so busy, you know, we can't guarantee I'll have the right address.
[03:37:00.799 --> 03:37:04.942]  Send it back, send us a copy, or if you don't want it, you can send us the original.
[03:37:04.942 --> 03:37:05.923]  But let me give you the P.O.
[03:37:05.923 --> 03:37:06.263]  Box.
[03:37:06.263 --> 03:37:06.703]  It's P.O.
[03:37:06.703 --> 03:37:11.567]  Box 1-9-5-4-9, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[03:37:11.567 --> 03:37:15.250]  And this film, two years in the making, more than five years of research,
[03:37:16.030 --> 03:37:18.092]  We got Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons.
[03:37:18.092 --> 03:37:20.295]  I never did anything with that footage I shot five years ago.
[03:37:20.295 --> 03:37:21.616]  But it got declassified.
[03:37:21.616 --> 03:37:26.602]  How the government could create hurricanes, steer hurricanes, use hurricanes.
[03:37:26.602 --> 03:37:29.445]  The point is, this film covers every angle.
[03:37:29.445 --> 03:37:29.946]  Okay?
[03:37:29.946 --> 03:37:31.127]  And I mean, the film...
[03:37:32.222 --> 03:37:34.103]  It's well more than half done.
[03:37:34.103 --> 03:37:36.924]  And it's kind of been sitting there on the shelf while I got more material.
[03:37:36.924 --> 03:37:44.568]  And I finally just said, look, I have this problem with obsessing on something and just getting more, more, more, more, more.
[03:37:44.568 --> 03:37:49.370]  Kind of like my JFK film, Five Years in the Making.
[03:37:49.370 --> 03:37:50.810]  I'm going to try to just pound it out.
[03:37:50.810 --> 03:37:55.773]  It's just that I've just got so much.
[03:37:57.348 --> 03:37:58.850]  So this is more than a chemtrail film.
[03:37:58.850 --> 03:38:04.738]  This is a eugenics documentary about so many issues, vaccines, you name it.
[03:38:04.738 --> 03:38:06.220]  And we're covering everything.
[03:38:06.220 --> 03:38:09.184]  This will be the definitive chemtrail film.
[03:38:09.184 --> 03:38:15.092]  But I do want to have... We've already got people from California and Texas and a few other states, but I...
[03:38:18.230 --> 03:38:19.791]  There it is on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:38:19.791 --> 03:38:22.433]  They've zoomed in on the wall to where I have the P.O.
[03:38:22.433 --> 03:38:24.795]  Box up there for when I forget the address.
[03:38:24.795 --> 03:38:25.995]  It's InfoWars P.O.
[03:38:25.995 --> 03:38:30.418]  Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760.
[03:38:30.418 --> 03:38:33.120]  Please mail it to us as quickly as you can.
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:34.341]  Carry a camera around with you.
[03:38:34.341 --> 03:38:35.221]  Put it on a tripod.
[03:38:35.221 --> 03:38:36.942]  Get us good footage of the chemtrails.
[03:38:36.942 --> 03:38:37.463]  Handheld.
[03:38:37.463 --> 03:38:38.143]  Whatever.
[03:38:38.143 --> 03:38:40.205]  And just get it to us.
[03:38:40.205 --> 03:38:41.686]  But also make some comments.
[03:38:43.187 --> 03:38:50.812]  And that may end up in the film because I want to show not just Alex Jones talking or the 20 plus people we've interviewed for this.
[03:38:50.812 --> 03:38:52.653]  I want to show you the people.
[03:38:52.653 --> 03:38:54.094]  We the people out there.
[03:38:54.094 --> 03:38:55.775]  And I want footage from Germany.
[03:38:55.775 --> 03:38:56.876]  I want footage from Russia.
[03:38:56.876 --> 03:38:58.317]  I want footage from Japan.
[03:38:58.317 --> 03:39:03.020]  I want footage from Brazil, from Mexico, from England, from Ireland, from Scotland.
[03:39:03.020 --> 03:39:04.941]  I need your help, InfoWarriors.
[03:39:04.941 --> 03:39:05.462]  So P.O.
[03:39:05.462 --> 03:39:05.742]  Box 19549.
[03:39:08.442 --> 03:39:10.744]  Austin, Texas, 78760.
[03:39:10.744 --> 03:39:18.089]  And Dave over at the Alex Jones Channel will also snippet out this little rant and post that for people on the web.
[03:39:18.089 --> 03:39:21.971]  We're going to post this video on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:39:21.971 --> 03:39:25.434]  I mean, it's an amazing documentary.
[03:39:25.434 --> 03:39:26.895]  And we got incredible chemtrails.
[03:39:28.075 --> 03:39:33.937]  Uh, but I just, I really want to show you the activists and have a little of that flavor in there.
[03:39:33.937 --> 03:39:37.018]  And that's the final thing I need to finish this film.
[03:39:37.018 --> 03:39:41.459]  So I want to thank you in advance for all your support and all the people that have mailed us chemtrail footage.
[03:39:41.459 --> 03:39:49.642]  You know, we didn't mail a lot of great chemtrail footage when I called for this a year ago and two years ago, respectively, but really no one sent me footage with him talking.
[03:39:50.402 --> 03:39:51.243]  And maybe you're nervous.
[03:39:51.243 --> 03:40:00.269]  Well, just aim it at a chemtrail while you talk and say, I'm here in Bakersfield, California, and they're spraying all the time.
[03:40:00.269 --> 03:40:01.470]  We're up on a hilltop.
[03:40:01.470 --> 03:40:03.951]  The shots I really want are cities.
[03:40:03.951 --> 03:40:07.094]  Because I've seen this so many times, but I don't have a camera.
[03:40:07.094 --> 03:40:08.935]  Like off 360, Austin.
[03:40:08.935 --> 03:40:14.439]  And you'll see a blue sky, and then they start spraying the trails, and it just turns the whole sky into a haze.
[03:40:14.439 --> 03:40:15.439]  And they're spraying them at 5,000 feet.
[03:40:18.484 --> 03:40:22.206]  And the planes go and turn around and go in crisscrosses.
[03:40:22.206 --> 03:40:23.067]  They're not landing.
[03:40:23.067 --> 03:40:24.067]  They're not waiting to land.
[03:40:24.067 --> 03:40:25.828]  I mean, rural areas.
[03:40:25.828 --> 03:40:39.557]  Also, also, send us your photos to RobD, R-O-B-D, stands for RobDew at InfoWars.com, or J-A-R-O-N.com, Jaren at InfoWars.com.
[03:40:39.557 --> 03:40:41.278]  Send us your photos that you took.
[03:40:42.520 --> 03:40:50.462]  Bigger res, better, and with a little note where you took it so we can put on the screen, you know, where this was shot.
[03:40:50.462 --> 03:40:52.262]  Photos are great as well.
[03:40:52.262 --> 03:40:53.963]  Photos you took five years ago.
[03:40:53.963 --> 03:41:00.144]  If you shot the video ten years ago, I want to be able to say this is ten years ago in Florida, in Tallahassee.
[03:41:00.144 --> 03:41:01.424]  I mean, dig through it all.
[03:41:01.424 --> 03:41:02.404]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:41:02.404 --> 03:41:02.744]  P.O.
[03:41:02.744 --> 03:41:06.525]  Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760.
[03:41:06.525 --> 03:41:09.426]  You know, I hate even getting into chemtrails here on air.
[03:41:10.725 --> 03:41:14.869]  Without even going over what it is, you know, we've got new listeners going, what in tarnations is this guy talking about?
[03:41:14.869 --> 03:41:19.713]  Well, just Google, White House calls for geoengineering planet to save us from global warming.
[03:41:19.713 --> 03:41:24.677]  Then you find out, they go, yes, we've had a secret program and we didn't want to tell you about it.
[03:41:24.677 --> 03:41:32.444]  We've had people like, like, like, like we paid, you know, so they had money for the hotel and stuff to send We Are Change to events in California.
[03:41:33.811 --> 03:41:41.157]  Over a year ago, where top globalists admitted, yeah, we've kept the program secret, but now we're telling you we are geoengineering.
[03:41:41.157 --> 03:41:44.039]  I mean, this is powerful stuff!
[03:41:44.039 --> 03:41:46.500]  Yeah, there's the Wall Street Journal.
[03:41:46.500 --> 03:41:49.883]  Team Obama will consider geoengineering to fight climate change, see?
[03:41:49.883 --> 03:41:57.308]  But then when you actually go to the conferences, they admit, oh, well, all the previous stuff was just a giant secret test on all of the continents of the planet.
[03:41:58.652 --> 03:42:22.469]  We got footage of jets flying right beside another jet with no condensation trail versus a trail, or we've got jets at 5,000 feet in the summer where you cannot get ice crystals, and at 30,000 feet up above them where you're supposed to get them, no ice crystals or real contrails being laid down that are dissipating in seconds versus artificial ones that are up there for hours.
[03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:23.090]  I mean, it's just
[03:42:24.580 --> 03:42:29.582]  It's unbelievable the scale of this program that is going on.
[03:42:29.582 --> 03:42:31.783]  And, you know, there's facilities out in Arizona.
[03:42:31.783 --> 03:42:34.323]  Just Google Chemtrail Facility, Arizona.
[03:42:34.323 --> 03:42:36.044]  We don't have the money, the time, the energy.
[03:42:36.044 --> 03:42:43.787]  If you want to go shoot footage of that and send it to us, and we've got the photos, send it all to robd at infowars.com.
[03:42:43.787 --> 03:42:48.989]  In fact, Matt, did we create that special email just for me?
[03:42:48.989 --> 03:42:49.589]  Did we ever do that?
[03:42:51.305 --> 03:42:53.167]  Because I asked him two weeks ago to create it.
[03:42:53.167 --> 03:42:54.568]  You know, we'll create one.
[03:42:54.568 --> 03:42:57.472]  Chemtrailsandinfowars.com right now.
[03:42:57.472 --> 03:43:00.294]  Will you call the IT guys in here right now?
[03:43:00.294 --> 03:43:01.676]  Thank you.
[03:43:01.676 --> 03:43:03.778]  Because if I don't do this now, it won't happen.
[03:43:03.778 --> 03:43:05.940]  Chemtrailsandinfowars.com.
[03:43:05.940 --> 03:43:08.864]  Chemtrailsandinfowars.com.
[03:43:08.864 --> 03:43:10.886]  Matt, can I have chemtrailsandinfowars.com?
[03:43:14.252 --> 03:43:17.333]  I just wanted to quickly make a suggestion for that JFK thing because you brought it up.
[03:43:17.333 --> 03:43:17.793]  Doug Horn was on
[03:43:43.300 --> 03:43:43.701]  I don't know.
[03:43:55.717 --> 03:44:12.927]  That definitively went through all the details to show that they were all either fabricated or manipulated or whatever the evidence... Well, Los Alamos Laboratories three years ago tested a lone bullet and found it wasn't the same bullet as the fragments and there were no fragments from the lone bullet.
[03:44:12.927 --> 03:44:13.568]  It's all fake!
[03:44:14.605 --> 03:44:24.680]  Yeah, well that's exactly what he was getting into, but he goes into meticulous detail, excruciating detail is what I'm saying, and you can't shoot his stuff down easily.
[03:44:28.814 --> 03:44:32.737]  Yeah, he was the part of the last investigator that thinks you should go over all the material.
[03:44:32.737 --> 03:44:35.398]  And even with the brain stuff, he seemed to search that down.
[03:44:35.398 --> 03:44:36.439]  He came up with new details.
[03:44:59.156 --> 03:45:03.082]  I'll have to get Jesse Ventura to talk to him then, because I'm consulting on...
[03:45:13.936 --> 03:45:18.560]  One other thing on the Build-A-Burgers, why can't we do something like the South Koreans did about a year ago or something like that?
[03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:19.501]  They used something like Twitter.
[03:45:39.437 --> 03:45:45.162]  Where they basically were just fed up with their government bailing out one of their big companies.
[03:45:45.162 --> 03:45:52.949]  They had a couple thousand people and before you know it they kept twittering all over the place until there were millions of people on the floor.
[03:45:52.949 --> 03:46:02.377]  Maybe something like that should be suggested or so how they did it because whenever one of these characters, whether it's a politician or Bilderbergers, if we could use what the Koreans did
[03:46:03.370 --> 03:46:08.614]  Instead of just a couple hundred people showing up, there'd be tens of thousands showing up and each day growing.
[03:46:08.614 --> 03:46:12.797]  Maybe they'd get the idea to shut this thing down before it gets out of hand.
[03:46:12.797 --> 03:46:13.678]  Well, that's a good point.
[03:46:13.678 --> 03:46:15.459]  I appreciate your call.
[03:46:15.459 --> 03:46:18.881]  I mean, it's up to you, the individuals, to make things like that happen.
[03:46:18.881 --> 03:46:28.688]  I know for several years they've had Twitter systems and others where the paparazzi use it to harass movie stars and TV personalities because everybody's on the Twitter in L.A.
[03:46:28.688 --> 03:46:32.151]  going, I've got, you know, Charlie Sheen, get him, he's over here eating.
[03:46:32.651 --> 03:46:35.653]  And that's kind of mean because Charlie doesn't deserve that.
[03:46:35.653 --> 03:46:43.380]  But for the politicians and the globalists, it certainly is an effective tool to expose them and let them know we're not happy with their criminal activity.
[03:46:43.380 --> 03:46:50.065]  You know, to at least come over there and have a hundred people show up at a restaurant when they're eating and say, we don't like your new world order, we're not your slaves.
[03:46:50.065 --> 03:46:52.447]  Just to let them know, hey, we know who you are.
[03:46:52.447 --> 03:46:57.771]  But as Brzezinski said, the people are now aware of the fact that we have a world government.
[03:46:57.771 --> 03:46:59.092]  That's a big part of it.
[03:46:59.092 --> 03:47:00.654]  Sam in California, you're on the air.
[03:47:01.334 --> 03:47:02.395]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:47:02.395 --> 03:47:14.543]  I know I don't got much time so I'm just gonna quickly start off by saying you're a true patriot and on top of that you are a humanitarian because information is everything and we need to educate everybody we can.
[03:47:14.543 --> 03:47:19.706]  I just recently was fortunate enough to get a link from a friend to your Facebook page
[03:47:20.331 --> 03:47:25.433]  And ever since then, I've been listening to you every single day, and I've been trying to call, and I just finally got through today.
[03:47:25.433 --> 03:47:27.213]  I wanted to start off- Well, that's a beautiful story.
[03:47:27.213 --> 03:47:29.634]  I mean, that's how we're reaching more and more people.
[03:47:29.634 --> 03:47:40.178]  Think of unlocking a mind, or giving somebody, you know, a great source of multispectrum information, because my listeners are activists and are reaching out to people.
[03:47:40.178 --> 03:47:42.058]  That's why we're having an effect.
[03:47:42.058 --> 03:47:43.599]  And it's not just this show.
[03:47:43.599 --> 03:47:47.160]  It's a paradigm shift across the board if the people realize
[03:47:56.925 --> 03:47:58.445]  Absolutely, you're absolutely right.
[03:47:58.445 --> 03:48:11.992]  And I just wanted to quickly touch up on Israel and a few other things because I myself am a Persian American, I'm Muslim American, and I don't want people lashing out at Jewish people because that's not right and that's not Islam at all.
[03:48:11.992 --> 03:48:17.235]  The thing is, you need to distinguish the difference between Judaism and Zionism.
[03:48:18.058 --> 03:48:33.689]  The Zionists are the ones that control the major state of Israel, and there's actually a group that I just recently found online called Jews United Against Zionism, and these are Jewish rabbis, Orthodox Jews, that do not believe in Israel.
[03:48:33.689 --> 03:48:36.571]  No, it's a neutral party, it's a neutral party, yeah.
[03:48:36.571 --> 03:48:37.432]  Absolutely.
[03:48:37.432 --> 03:48:44.217]  And this is just one thing that needs to be touched upon, because people are really starting to move towards anti-Semitism, and that's not what is
[03:48:44.837 --> 03:48:55.040]  Well, my issue is, though, is that the brand of Zionism with blockades of Gaza and doing all those horrible things is really bad and I'm against it.
[03:48:55.040 --> 03:48:57.461]  But then there's... I think it's terms.
[03:48:57.461 --> 03:49:05.184]  When people use a term like Zionist, well, I mean, there's so many, like, Christians who want the end of the world to happen in Israel.
[03:49:05.184 --> 03:49:06.924]  They call themselves Christian Zionists.
[03:49:06.924 --> 03:49:09.305]  So I think that's where these terms confuse people.
[03:49:10.097 --> 03:49:11.138]  Great, they do.
[03:49:11.138 --> 03:49:21.763]  And, you know, these are things that we need to distinguish the difference between, because the last thing we need is misinformed people starting, you know, controversy that we don't need.
[03:49:21.763 --> 03:49:30.707]  Because we have bigger problems, like the Vildeberg Group and these elites who seek to control our world, our way of life, our way of thought.
[03:49:30.707 --> 03:49:32.668]  And that's the true terrorism.
[03:49:32.668 --> 03:49:35.790]  That's what we need to fight, is the fact that they go on the news
[03:49:36.286 --> 03:49:41.168]  And spread their propaganda to basically manifest fear in people.
[03:49:41.168 --> 03:49:52.111]  So when they come out with these outrageous plans to have carbon taxes and this and that, we can't stand for that.
[03:49:52.111 --> 03:49:52.711]  And you know what?
[03:49:52.711 --> 03:49:54.232]  Information is everything.
[03:49:54.232 --> 03:49:56.673]  You're doing the right thing and I'm going to do my part.
[03:49:56.673 --> 03:49:58.653]  I'm going to take footage of Chemtrails.
[03:49:58.653 --> 03:50:03.335]  I've been telling every person that I come in contact with about you and your show.
[03:50:04.125 --> 03:50:05.526]  And that's just what I'm trying to do.
[03:50:05.526 --> 03:50:06.607]  I'm 26 years old.
[03:50:06.607 --> 03:50:08.689]  I'm a different demographic.
[03:50:08.689 --> 03:50:13.193]  And me and my friends, we've been buying respiration gear and biochemical suits.
[03:50:13.193 --> 03:50:14.995]  We've been buying everything we could.
[03:50:14.995 --> 03:50:15.836]  Gold.
[03:50:15.836 --> 03:50:16.216]  Everything.
[03:50:16.216 --> 03:50:17.357]  Because we actually do think
[03:50:18.004 --> 03:50:22.166]  These elite are going to try something absurd, like martial law.
[03:50:22.166 --> 03:50:24.287]  And, you know, I just can't see that happening.
[03:50:24.287 --> 03:50:31.991]  Well, I mean, it's an incremental martial law, where they put you through naked body scanners and then admit they're recording your genitals and laughing at you.
[03:50:31.991 --> 03:50:33.272]  That's martial law.
[03:50:33.272 --> 03:50:42.517]  Or when the IRS takes your house, or when cities are taking houses for $360 water bills, that's martial law.
[03:50:42.517 --> 03:50:45.939]  When the government's saying they may take your pension funds, that's martial law.
[03:50:46.519 --> 03:50:50.544]  When police are beating up people for videotaping them, that's martial law.
[03:50:50.544 --> 03:50:52.386]  And so incrementally, we are going into this.
[03:50:52.386 --> 03:50:58.332]  I'm gonna hit a few news articles and a few more calls on the other side from Charlie, John, Sean, and others.
[03:50:58.332 --> 03:51:01.996]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.996 --> 03:51:03.318]  Don't answer it!
[03:51:03.869 --> 03:51:11.977]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[03:51:19.804 --> 03:51:24.067]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:51:24.067 --> 03:51:31.432]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days guaranteed, without a payment plan, and without attorneys or going to court.

[03:51:54.530 --> 03:51:54.710]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:52:00.875 --> 03:52:03.217]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:52:03.217 --> 03:52:05.579]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:52:05.579 --> 03:52:08.801]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:52:08.801 --> 03:52:13.905]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:13.905 --> 03:52:18.088]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:18.408 --> 03:52:20.750]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:20.750 --> 03:52:23.631]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:23.631 --> 03:52:26.553]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:26.553 --> 03:52:34.158]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:34.478 --> 03:52:39.883]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:39.883 --> 03:52:42.206]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:42.206 --> 03:52:46.430]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:46.430 --> 03:52:47.491]  And I got news for you.
[03:52:47.491 --> 03:52:48.832]  You're everyone else.
[03:52:48.832 --> 03:52:50.334]  Invisible Empire.

[03:53:30.230 --> 03:53:30.850]  We're good to go.
[03:54:05.885 --> 03:54:14.091]  Well, a couple weeks ago, prominent members of Chicago society, 80 plus years old, were being robbed at weapon point.
[03:54:14.091 --> 03:54:16.533]  So they defended themselves with firearms.
[03:54:16.533 --> 03:54:18.695]  And I said, watch, they're probably going to be indicted.
[03:54:18.695 --> 03:54:22.258]  And the Mob Boss Daily is moving to have them indicted.
[03:54:23.485 --> 03:54:44.737]  A Korean war vet in Chicago in the last few days used a firearm to shoot and kill a long time felon who was benefited from the catch and release program and he was breaking in to the home and attacking the guy's wife so he shot him and Mayor Daley is basically calling him scum.
[03:54:46.715 --> 03:54:53.282]  Just like a reporter a few weeks ago talked about the Second Amendment and how there's no right to own guns in Chicago because they have a higher crime rate.
[03:54:53.282 --> 03:54:58.067]  And Daley went crazy and said, I will shove a gun up your... and I will, you know, I'll blow you away.
[03:54:58.067 --> 03:55:00.970]  I mean, he's just like a wild animal.
[03:55:00.970 --> 03:55:01.630]  I rule you!
[03:55:01.630 --> 03:55:02.731]  I'm gonna get your guns!
[03:55:02.731 --> 03:55:03.492]  I own you!
[03:55:03.492 --> 03:55:04.813]  I'm taking it all!
[03:55:04.813 --> 03:55:07.957]  I mean, that's just who these people are.
[03:55:07.957 --> 03:55:08.998]  Bloomberg, all of them.
[03:55:11.584 --> 03:55:14.066]  New law will require a license to be a journalist.
[03:55:14.066 --> 03:55:16.007]  That's all over the news.
[03:55:16.007 --> 03:55:20.331]  Calls increase for government to regulate internet journalists and bloggers.
[03:55:20.331 --> 03:55:24.414]  Liberal coalition demands FCC move to shut down talk radio.
[03:55:24.414 --> 03:55:27.516]  I mean this is like, this is all over the news.
[03:55:27.516 --> 03:55:30.718]  This is mainstream news this is going on.
[03:55:30.718 --> 03:55:31.659]  Here's some good news though.
[03:55:31.659 --> 03:55:33.300]  They demonized Rand Paul.
[03:55:33.300 --> 03:55:35.101]  Said he was basically Adolf Hitler.
[03:55:35.101 --> 03:55:35.962]  What happened?
[03:55:35.962 --> 03:55:36.963]  It was all lies.
[03:55:36.963 --> 03:55:40.425]  His approval rating and his polls went up!
[03:55:40.425 --> 03:55:41.006]  Went up!
[03:55:43.902 --> 03:55:44.703]  So that's the good news.
[03:55:44.703 --> 03:55:46.624]  People are not buying the propaganda anymore.
[03:55:46.624 --> 03:55:52.468]  And that article is at GCN Live, just GCNLive.com by Paul Watson.
[03:55:52.468 --> 03:55:57.232]  Rand Paul extends lead over Conway despite racism smear.
[03:55:57.232 --> 03:55:58.553]  Get this out to everybody.
[03:55:58.553 --> 03:56:01.114]  Send it to the media and say, you're out of bullets.
[03:56:01.114 --> 03:56:02.596]  No one believes you anymore.
[03:56:02.596 --> 03:56:05.978]  When you demonize someone, people go, oh, I better vote for him.
[03:56:05.978 --> 03:56:07.979]  Charlie in New York, you're on the air.
[03:56:07.979 --> 03:56:08.340]  Go ahead.
[03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:10.411]  Pleasure to talk to you, Alex.
[03:56:10.411 --> 03:56:12.651]  Long time listener, first-time caller.
[03:56:12.651 --> 03:56:13.072]  Welcome.
[03:56:13.072 --> 03:56:15.733]  Very brief, we're running out of time.
[03:56:15.733 --> 03:56:20.054]  Like yourself, I always like to get my information correct.
[03:56:20.054 --> 03:56:25.636]  I'm sorry I missed Victor when he was on, but I have a statement from a Dr. Alan Soborski.
[03:56:25.636 --> 03:56:29.238]  He's the former director of Strategic Studies Institute, U.S.
[03:56:29.238 --> 03:56:30.919]  Army War College.
[03:56:30.919 --> 03:56:35.020]  He states in a one-line statement, it is 100% certain 9-11 was a Mossad operation.
[03:56:37.645 --> 03:56:45.473]  He's an impeccable source, and I think he has access to intelligence that you and I could only dream of having.
[03:56:45.473 --> 03:56:46.214]  Who is that again?
[03:56:46.214 --> 03:56:48.337]  Dr. Alan Ceborski.
[03:56:48.337 --> 03:56:49.017]  S-A-B-R-O-S-K-Y.
[03:56:55.734 --> 03:57:06.599]  My only issue is, I had Alan Hart on earlier, former top BBC reporter, and he said, well, I think the Arabs are going to attack us and Israel knew and basically piggybacked.
[03:57:06.599 --> 03:57:12.422]  And from my research, you know, NORAD was ordered to stand down.
[03:57:12.422 --> 03:57:18.265]  Cheney, in front of the Transportation Secretary in the bunker, said the order still stands for the stand down.
[03:57:19.485 --> 03:57:20.046]  The U.S.
[03:57:20.046 --> 03:57:22.248]  embassies were ordered to let the guys in.
[03:57:22.248 --> 03:57:24.069]  They were trained at military bases.
[03:57:24.069 --> 03:57:26.591]  They thought they were taking part in a drill.
[03:57:26.591 --> 03:57:31.615]  And I know it's all kind of cause celeb and trendy to say Israel did it.
[03:57:31.615 --> 03:57:32.316]  I understand that.
[03:57:32.316 --> 03:57:34.477]  I'm not saying Israel doesn't do false flags.
[03:57:34.477 --> 03:57:38.941]  And there were a lot of neocons involved in 9-11 that are, you know, really Israeli agents.
[03:57:38.941 --> 03:57:40.982]  But to say just Israel did it?
[03:57:44.440 --> 03:57:47.301]  I like Tarpley's detailed analysis, Charlie.
[03:57:47.301 --> 03:57:52.502]  And that explains how they have mole, rogue networks in all the major Western intelligence agencies.
[03:57:52.502 --> 03:57:56.784]  It's kind of like the Mujahideen had Pakistani, Israeli, U.S.
[03:57:56.784 --> 03:57:58.284]  and British support.
[03:57:58.284 --> 03:58:02.646]  And over and over again, they... I'm just saying there's multi-heads of the Hydra.
[03:58:02.646 --> 03:58:04.966]  People say, no, it's a one-headed dragon.
[03:58:04.966 --> 03:58:09.348]  Well, I mean, you know... My research shows multi-headed dragon.
[03:58:09.348 --> 03:58:10.408]  I mean, what do you say to that?
[03:58:11.224 --> 03:58:13.785]  I believe there are others that are complicit in this operation.
[03:58:13.785 --> 03:58:14.986]  It just wasn't one-sided.
[03:58:14.986 --> 03:58:18.748]  I want to touch on one other thing, and then I'm going to let others get through.
[03:58:18.748 --> 03:58:26.892]  As far as your chemtrails spraying with the chemicals that we're all being exposed to, there's a product out there that will get rid of all of these toxins in our air.
[03:58:26.892 --> 03:58:31.094]  Well, unfortunately, we're out of time, so we won't have time to get others through.
[03:58:31.094 --> 03:58:35.636]  Mike, John, Sean, James, calling back tomorrow, I guess you're ahead of the line if you tell folks you were on hold.
[03:58:35.636 --> 03:58:36.356]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:36.356 --> 03:58:37.877]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:37.877 --> 03:58:38.997]  We have news from Bilderberg.
[03:58:38.997 --> 03:58:40.218]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[03:58:43.522 --> 03:58:46.012]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.012 --> 03:58:48.362]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.038 --> 03:58:56.022]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:58:56.022 --> 03:58:57.002]  What have we got?
[03:58:57.002 --> 03:58:59.464]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:58:59.464 --> 03:59:00.465]  A republic.
[03:59:00.465 --> 03:59:03.107]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:59:03.107 --> 03:59:05.389]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:59:05.389 --> 03:59:07.410]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:59:07.410 --> 03:59:09.091]  So they think they own our land?
[03:59:09.091 --> 03:59:10.412]  They think they own our water?
[03:59:10.412 --> 03:59:11.013]  Children?
[03:59:11.013 --> 03:59:12.134]  Our education?
[03:59:12.134 --> 03:59:12.954]  Our money?
[03:59:12.954 --> 03:59:16.617]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:59:16.977 --> 03:59:21.944]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:59:21.944 --> 03:59:22.985]  We have the facts.
[03:59:22.985 --> 03:59:24.127]  We have the Constitution.
[03:59:24.127 --> 03:59:25.048]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:59:25.048 --> 03:59:25.929]  We have common law.
[03:59:25.929 --> 03:59:28.453]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:59:28.453 --> 03:59:32.238]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:59:32.318 --> 03:59:37.279]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:59:37.279 --> 03:59:38.779]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:59:38.779 --> 03:59:39.860]  Don't tread on me.
[03:59:39.860 --> 03:59:51.802]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:59:51.802 --> 03:59:53.323]  Coast to Coast.
[03:59:53.323 --> 03:59:55.363]  Direct from Austin.
[03:59:55.363 --> 03:59:58.584]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
