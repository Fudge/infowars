[00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.231]  And we're also getting Jim Tucker lined up on the line as well right now.
[00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:09.793]  Now it officially kicked off today, but they shut the hotel down yesterday.
[00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:15.855]  We had London Guardian reporter on, Charlie Skelton, who was actually arrested last year in Greece.
[00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:25.639]  So to give us what's happening on the ground and any intel that Mark and Jim Tucker have gotten on what's on the agenda, here's Mark Anderson of AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.120]  Mark, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.841]  My pleasure.
[00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.624]  We've been inundated with local media and state media requests.
[00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:34.686]  It's been a very interesting day.
[00:00:35.307 --> 00:00:55.624]  Yeah, I mean, we've gone from 33 years ago or so, when the media would say that Jim was a kook and Bilderberg didn't exist, you know, the real trailblazer on this, to now, the Drudge Report, the Times of London, secret of Bilderberg Club, ready for protest, and they admit they're pushing for world government there in Sigis, Spain.
[00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:59.318]  Yeah, that's part and parcel of what's going on here.
[00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:04.006]  Lots of national and regional media interest, conventional corporate media as well.
[00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:10.336]  The secrecy is being stripped away, but their drive and their ambitions are a hard thing to satisfy.
[00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:15.808]  Well, I saw you interviewed by Russia Today on the ground with some of the protesters there.
[00:01:15.848 --> 00:01:17.529]  I saw the police shoving protesters.
[00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:24.031]  I even saw some of the protesters shoving the police back, and the police didn't attack them, so it looked like the police aren't wanting a confrontation.
[00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:33.154]  Normally, police would go haywire if somebody, you know, shoved them back, but, you know, because they're used to people submitting to their godlike authority to assault them, but not to be assaulted back.
[00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:40.857]  Break down the type of security you're seeing and expanding on that, any intel you're getting from inside the hotel.
[00:01:41.843 --> 00:01:52.752]  The security, after I was at Hotel Dulce on June 1st, began to show up as the local police on June 2nd, and it intensified with these paddy wagons.
[00:01:52.792 --> 00:02:00.599]  They have mobile detention vans that the police can ride in themselves, but if they had to detain someone, they can do it on the spot.
[00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:07.843]  Oh, and I've been told by reliable sources that the plainclothes to private security are beginning to filter in.
[00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:21.131]  But what I've seen and what you saw on the Russia program was local police clearing one of those roundabouts, those round turnaround areas common in Europe, and they had to clear the grass area in the middle of that.
[00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:31.080]  So, protesters and activists and journalists could not clearly see or as clearly see or photograph any dark tinted window cars going in.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.763]  It was just to kind of limit visibility and marginalize everyone.
[00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:40.768]  The pushing and shoving was a lot of local activists that just said, keep your hands off me, keep your hands off me.
[00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.431]  But so far, the police have showed a lot of restraint.
[00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:46.614]  In terms of what's going on information-wise,
[00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:59.102]  I know the broad brush strokes that they have been looking at making the IMF into a real treasury and things like that, but the minutiae, the detail, we're still working on, and Jim can probably address that a little more.
[00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.854]  Yeah, and I know Jim is trying to make his way up to his hotel room being mobbed by media.
[00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:09.521]  This is the complete opposite of even what was happening ten years ago with almost no mainstream media coverage.
[00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:17.391]  We know this has got to be upsetting these world government schemers that they can't have their little mafia commission meetings in secret anymore.
[00:03:18.308 --> 00:03:36.720]  Oh, I think it is, and the more this is done, the more they're going to get the pie in the face, so to speak, for people knowing they're meeting, and yet no forthcoming press releases, no, you know, openness or transparency, no lists or anything of names, their dishonor roll, I call it, and it's
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.521]  You know, at some point, something's got to give.
[00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:46.665]  With the Greek economy having taken a dive since last year's Bilderberg meeting in Greece, I think the Spanish see the writing on the wall.
[00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:53.268]  And there's a lot of Spanish people, bartenders, shopkeepers, have told me that they see their economy going the same way.
[00:03:53.408 --> 00:03:58.470]  And, you know, as night follows day, the Bilderberg machinations, the fingerprints are all over this thing.
[00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:07.112]  Now I know you and Jim have been running around throughout the city trying to reach contacts.
[00:04:07.573 --> 00:04:11.077]  Jim got there a day late because of his plane being delayed.
[00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:13.580]  Normally he goes into the hotel before it gets shut down.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.986]  I've been there with him before when this has been done in Canada and of course in Virginia.
[00:04:19.787 --> 00:04:22.550]  But tell us about some of the sleuth work you've been doing.
[00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:29.976]  Well, without going into too much detail, to tip my hand too much, just generally trying to learn the ropes.
[00:04:30.176 --> 00:04:35.358]  I'm a newcomer to Bilderberg, not in writing and reading about it, but in actually attending one.
[00:04:35.998 --> 00:04:38.279]  I guess you could call me Jim's apprentice in a way.
[00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:51.523]  This is a very complicated affair when you're dealing with so many important people lodged into one spot, and you're trying to get information that you can consider reliable, not just information or rumors.
[00:04:52.544 --> 00:04:54.805]  A big thing has been to wake the town and tell the people.
[00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:57.888]  Kind of the Z of Zorro on the wall.
[00:04:57.948 --> 00:05:03.712]  A lot of flyers have been circulating, written in Spanish, telling the average Spanish person what's going on in their town.
[00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:16.242]  And I produced some of those and they went pretty viral at a lot of the protests at a train station and at different spots around Sitges, which is sort of an outreach of Barcelona, Spain, here along the Mediterranean.
[00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:28.948]  The sleuth work has included this year I was the one to go into the hotel early before they closed it down and what was curious was there were already virtually no people there.
[00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:39.794]  I tried their wine and looked out over the beautiful view but there was really hardly anyone there already and they had that place vacuumed as clean as clean can get.
[00:05:40.454 --> 00:05:53.128]  And without going into too much detail, there just wasn't any sign yet of information or people for the actual Bilderberg meeting, but there was a very distinct lack of customers.
[00:05:53.428 --> 00:05:56.492]  And of course I inquired, can I get a hotel room here in a couple of nights?
[00:05:56.952 --> 00:05:58.934]  And they said, no, there's a big convention.
[00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:00.796]  You cannot be here, you know.
[00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:04.213]  I was just playing with them a little bit.
[00:06:06.154 --> 00:06:18.059]  There's a lot of ironies and intrigue going on, but the media coverage from all levels, both independent and regular media, is really quite intense.
[00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:23.522]  A lot of TV crews have been there all day, yesterday and all day, or part of the day, the day before.
[00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:25.661]  Well, that's exciting.
[00:06:28.702 --> 00:06:33.543]  What's the flavor of the reporting that's going on that you're seeing on television and the press?
[00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:36.343]  Or are you unable to read it because you don't speak Spanish?
[00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:37.824]  I mean, I know I don't.
[00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:42.005]  Well, you know, it's not so much the language barrier, though that plays a role.
[00:06:42.105 --> 00:06:48.246]  It's that I'm so busy doing this, what I do, that I don't have time to see the results of what they do, let alone
[00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:51.107]  No it did, it's mainly about the security.
[00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:17.873]  And so it's tricky, it's hard to even, sometimes the reporters that you talk to don't provide all the information on what stations they broadcast on, how to dial it in.
[00:07:17.973 --> 00:07:20.334]  But the point is there's a lot of media there, so that's exciting.
[00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:28.616]  It's been almost constant, and it's a great mixture of the independent bloggers right on up to your national and regional TV stations.
[00:07:29.636 --> 00:07:35.058]  I heard one lady reporter with a national Spanish station arguing with her editor or her boss
[00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:41.357]  Uh, saying we do too much trivia, too much bubble gum, we need to do more with this, which is, you know, a good thing to hear.
[00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:50.580]  Well, I was talking to Charlie Skelton yesterday from The Guardian, and he said he was talking to BBC TV.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:58.764]  They were getting ready to run with it, and then later the editor said, look, this has been killed, or the producer he was talking to said, this story's now been killed.
[00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:07.269]  So we do see Bilderberg there, you know, trying to suppress the news, trying to keep real news from hitting the media, but they're having less and less control.
[00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:10.991]  Let me ask you this, Mr. Anderson from American Free Press, Deputy Editor.
[00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:21.881]  Did you see Zbigniew Brzezinski's speech of two weeks ago that we wrote about and was later picked up and used in a speech before the EU Parliament a few days ago?
[00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:30.871]  Quotes from our article dealing with the fact that Brzezinski basically said, for the first time in history the whole world is awake to our world government and things are getting tougher for us.
[00:08:31.713 --> 00:08:42.344]  I saw a clip of that that somebody sent me, like an excerpt, and the only thing I would caution, and I think that's true, what he said, is what Taylor Caldwell, the late author, said.
[00:08:42.424 --> 00:08:49.611]  She warned that we shouldn't too easily believe that these power elite have large squabbles among themselves.
[00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.315]  They might have minor points of disagreement, but they do tend to think
[00:08:53.955 --> 00:08:56.437]  Pretty much birds of a feather flock together, you know.
[00:08:56.957 --> 00:09:02.020]  And so, some of that could be for public consumption, you know, like the fun zoo, the art of war.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.561]  When you are strong, appear weak.
[00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:06.162]  When you are weak, appear strong.
[00:09:06.602 --> 00:09:16.348]  We have to be very careful, and I've cautioned Jim, and Jim agrees, that what Brzezinski said is probably true, but we don't want them to play possum on us.
[00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:20.991]  We don't want them to put out urban legends that we'll believe too easily.
[00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:27.199]  Yeah, I agree with you, but I'm not a spring chicken in all of this research myself.
[00:09:27.219 --> 00:09:28.640]  Of course not.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.761]  And what he said is true, just from my own research.
[00:09:32.622 --> 00:09:34.042]  The awakening is real.
[00:09:34.142 --> 00:09:35.123]  I see it on the streets.
[00:09:35.663 --> 00:09:38.484]  And sure, we don't want to take from this, oh, we've beat them.
[00:09:38.884 --> 00:09:45.087]  No, we are now just finally finding our feet and have gotten a few good blows in, so we're in the fight.
[00:09:45.747 --> 00:09:55.210]  But I mean, I think the victory at Trenton by George Washington against the Hessians, you know, in the middle of the Revolutionary War, I don't think that was them going, God, we've won the war.
[00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.611]  I think it was, my God, we're starting to win a few battles here.
[00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:02.252]  And the fact that world government is being set up
[00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:02.933]  I think so.
[00:10:16.397 --> 00:10:35.724]  Yeah, that's a pretty good analogy, Alex, and I think the part that's true is the public awakening, and that has got to trouble the octogenarian tyrants like David Rockefeller and his apprentices or associates like Zbigniew Brzezinski, trilateral boys.
[00:10:36.524 --> 00:10:46.428]  Um, and it's got to be troubling to them because I think the patriarch Rockefeller wants to see certain things happen before he goes to the great Bilderberg meeting in the sky, you know?
[00:10:46.908 --> 00:10:48.269]  And, excuse me, I'm a little giggly.
[00:10:48.289 --> 00:10:49.429]  I haven't slept hardly.
[00:10:49.909 --> 00:10:54.131]  And, uh, so, you know, at some point they're going to get impatient and, um...
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:00.722]  Hopefully there won't be any strange events or big wars or, you know, they always resort to war in the final analysis.
[00:11:01.142 --> 00:11:03.323]  Well, I agree with you, and that's the key intel.
[00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:05.484]  We can't wait till Jim's able to talk to some sources.
[00:11:06.064 --> 00:11:11.286]  But you can also see the Bilderberg mouthpieces more and more out in the open, trying to deal with the 24-hour news cycle.
[00:11:11.306 --> 00:11:16.208]  They're a lot more public, you know, Bilderberg group members, in basically pushing the agenda.
[00:11:16.228 --> 00:11:23.751]  And undoubtedly, within days of the meeting ending, we'll see their spin on what their real agenda is.
[00:11:24.731 --> 00:11:28.673]  But certainly they're gearing up to go into Iran, that's back on the front burner.
[00:11:29.053 --> 00:11:33.835]  Certainly they're using this whole Mediterranean thing with Israel as a new way to kick stuff off.
[00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:41.278]  The whole North Korean peninsula, the George Washington mega aircraft carrier going off the coast of North Korea.
[00:11:41.638 --> 00:11:45.780]  I mean, war is their only card right now, or giant false flag terror attack.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.204]  That's the downside to the Wonderful Awakening, is that they always, in the end, resort to what you just said.
[00:11:52.644 --> 00:12:02.371]  The only card that they can play without much interference, and that's the War card, and that's, you know, I don't even have to go into why that's bad or how unfortunate that is.
[00:12:03.031 --> 00:12:03.371]  Yeah.
[00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:24.083]  They've got a lot of variables, maybe, but in the end, you're right.
[00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:28.466]  War with Iran, as Jim Tucker has reported, has been a major Bilderberg goal.
[00:12:28.986 --> 00:12:31.808]  Perhaps on behalf of Israel, maybe there's an element there.
[00:12:31.868 --> 00:12:42.214]  And then the IMF as a world treasury, perhaps the World Health Organization as a world health department, maybe using some swine flu-like excuse or something.
[00:12:42.774 --> 00:12:48.483]  But at the same time, you know, maybe war gets a little messy for them on occasion.
[00:12:48.523 --> 00:12:50.426]  Maybe they can only fight on so many fronts.
[00:12:51.464 --> 00:12:51.984]  I think?
[00:13:13.354 --> 00:13:22.128]  Press release, something, even put on a semblance of openness, although I know it's not real meaningful, but I think we need to force their hand on that.
[00:13:22.762 --> 00:13:24.182]  Well, well said, Mark Anderson.
[00:13:24.202 --> 00:13:29.244]  I look forward to having you pop back on sometime tomorrow when you've got more intel of what's happening.
[00:13:29.544 --> 00:13:35.946]  We're going to work on getting Jim on coming up in the last hour, about an hour and 15 minutes from now, to get him to pop in.
[00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:39.628]  I know he's got jet lag and is exhausted and trying to make his way up to his room right now.
[00:13:39.648 --> 00:13:43.109]  So I'm going to put you on hold with my producer.
[00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:49.959]  Here in just a moment so you guys can try to work that out because you're there basically assisting Mr. Tucker.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:57.691]  But before you go, tell folks how they can subscribe to the American Free Press and get all these detailed reports that will come out in the next few days on Bilderberg.
[00:13:59.023 --> 00:14:01.465]  Online, it's AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:03.166]  That's AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:06.189]  Call 888-699-NEWS.
[00:14:06.249 --> 00:14:12.996]  That's 888-699-NEWS for subscription information or if you want to just get a specific insert or issue.
[00:14:13.596 --> 00:14:20.803]  And then you can get a 16 weeks for $17.76 trial subscription during the holidays.
[00:14:20.863 --> 00:14:23.045]  Sometimes it's 16 weeks for $16.
[00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:23.966]  That's four months.
[00:14:24.706 --> 00:14:25.327]  I think so.
[00:14:39.108 --> 00:14:39.628]  Absolutely.
[00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:41.170]  We're going to break here in about two minutes.
[00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.272]  I want to speak to you during the break, but I'm going to hand you over to Jaron right now.
[00:14:44.312 --> 00:14:45.493]  We'll talk to you again soon, sir.
[00:14:45.533 --> 00:14:46.253]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:14:46.394 --> 00:14:46.974]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:14:46.994 --> 00:14:47.715]  Appreciate it.
[00:14:47.795 --> 00:14:48.095]  You bet.
[00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:51.137]  We'll get Mark Anderson on tomorrow or Sunday.
[00:14:51.537 --> 00:14:54.099]  Sunday might be the show, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:54.540]  Central.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.902]  We do shows six days a week here, if you're just tuned in.
[00:14:57.922 --> 00:15:04.447]  Because so much happens over the weekend, I do a two-hour, abbreviated broadcast transmission, because so much is happening.
[00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:14.716]  Maybe we should work on getting Tucker and Anderson on then as well, because then they'll have all their notes in hindsight and we can get some real intel, because things are just now kicking off.
[00:15:15.176 --> 00:15:24.684]  It starts officially Thursday, some arrive on the Wednesday, and then they have the meeting Thursday evening, Friday, Saturday they play golf generally, and then Sunday they leave.
[00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:28.767]  And we always get valuable info from Tucker.
[00:15:29.488 --> 00:15:34.211]  There's other people go to the meetings and kind of get some good intel, make some stuff up.
[00:15:35.372 --> 00:15:37.473]  But there's other folks that get good information as well.
[00:15:38.254 --> 00:15:41.296]  But more and more, I mean, I'm just calling it like it is.
[00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:50.301]  Bilderberg is more about the spectacle of the elite trying to meet in secret, trying to suppress media coverage.
[00:15:51.222 --> 00:15:52.723]  The world government's now out in the open.
[00:15:54.171 --> 00:16:03.953]  And now, this isn't Jim Tucker 30 plus years ago talking about world government and digging through the trash at Bilderberg and sneaking in and getting key info.
[00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:05.573]  And that still happens.
[00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:06.794]  Now it's out in the open.
[00:16:07.474 --> 00:16:11.234]  A global constitution of the private central banks that you will pay carbon taxes to.
[00:16:11.935 --> 00:16:18.196]  And Obama is hell-bent to get this through and he's saying, well, because of the BP spill, he's got to do this now.
[00:16:19.156 --> 00:16:40.855]  Uh, because, you know, they've had this problem, uh, and because they can't seem to fix it, and just so happens Goldman Sachs dumped most of their, uh, more than half their stock, uh, just on BP, uh, days before, and, and now Obama says, see, we need carbon taxes, we need an environmental takeover because of this oil spill, and then BP, of course, is the chief globalist
[00:16:41.195 --> 00:16:41.655]  We're good.
[00:16:56.192 --> 00:16:56.312]  That's
[00:17:12.968 --> 00:17:14.869]  And that they're not going to give us any quarter.
[00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:20.311]  And it's very important for everyone out there to get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement on DVD.
[00:17:21.472 --> 00:17:29.315]  That's probably overall the most important film I've ever made because it gives you, in two hours and 35 minutes, the entire spectrum of what we're facing.
[00:17:29.655 --> 00:17:33.077]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and a lot more when Viktor Ostrovsky joins us.
[00:17:33.617 --> 00:17:36.498]  You've seen our SinoFresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:17:36.618 --> 00:17:38.579]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:17:38.679 --> 00:17:41.341]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:43.382]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:17:43.662 --> 00:17:44.843]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:46.684]  But first, the facts.
[00:17:46.964 --> 00:17:48.685]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:17:48.905 --> 00:17:50.626]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:17:50.887 --> 00:17:54.369]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:17:54.569 --> 00:18:01.973]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:18:02.334 --> 00:18:02.934]  Sinofresh.
[00:18:03.194 --> 00:18:06.076]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[00:18:24.507 --> 00:18:24.907]  It works!
[00:18:33.277 --> 00:18:34.518]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:34.578 --> 00:18:39.920]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.782]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:45.182 --> 00:18:50.244]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:18:50.744 --> 00:18:55.426]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:18:55.967 --> 00:19:02.890]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.991]  And here's the best part.
[00:19:04.191 --> 00:19:10.573]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:19:10.894 --> 00:19:13.735]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:14.075 --> 00:19:17.156]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:19:17.176 --> 00:19:17.396]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:19:26.021 --> 00:19:29.604]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:19:29.945 --> 00:19:32.367]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:19:33.128 --> 00:19:40.655]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.

[00:20:49.795 --> 00:20:51.456]  All right, I'm going to go to some of your phone calls.
[00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:56.120]  Corey, Sonny, Bruce, Repatriate Ian in this segment and the next.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.362]  And then we've got Victor Ostrowski on.
[00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:01.564]  I had a lot of callers today.
[00:21:01.604 --> 00:21:06.929]  You heard them critical of what I had to say about the flotilla.
[00:21:08.511 --> 00:21:12.095]  And, uh, you know, implying that I was saying people didn't have a right to defend themselves.
[00:21:13.016 --> 00:21:14.737]  Uh, again, more straw man arguments.
[00:21:15.798 --> 00:21:17.420]  Uh, I don't care if people hate me.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.062]  I mean, that's what folks don't understand.
[00:21:19.102 --> 00:21:19.962]  It doesn't hurt me.
[00:21:21.244 --> 00:21:24.347]  Uh, you know, people make stuff up or exaggerate or build straw men.
[00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:28.310]  Uh, I just feel sorry for people not being honest about what I've said.
[00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:41.740]  I was pointing out that I saw press reports where the people on that ship had claimed that they were fired on first, and now watching the videos, it looks like they were attacking people first.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.042]  Now clearly, the boarding is a form of assault.
[00:21:45.703 --> 00:21:47.585]  And I got a guest coming on who's critical of it.
[00:21:48.626 --> 00:21:50.567]  But, you know, it's so tribal.
[00:21:50.627 --> 00:21:55.011]  It's like you've got to be on the pro-Israel side, or you've got to be on the anti-Israel side.
[00:21:56.352 --> 00:21:57.414]  And I'm rebellious, folks.
[00:21:57.654 --> 00:21:58.716]  I'm not going to be on either side.
[00:21:59.197 --> 00:22:01.200]  I'm here covering the issues.
[00:22:02.862 --> 00:22:06.688]  And the articles on Infowars.com and PrisonBuddy.com have been critical.
[00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.691]  I'm trying to...
[00:22:10.334 --> 00:22:13.258]  In my own little way, stop some type of confrontation.
[00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:15.561]  But I'm not out there in the Mediterranean.
[00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:16.643]  I'm not boarding the ship.
[00:22:17.123 --> 00:22:19.046]  And I'm not beating the Israelis with the poles.
[00:22:20.368 --> 00:22:25.815]  I'm here in Texas calling for the Second Amendment and sovereignty and supporting our borders and liberty.
[00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.554]  And you know, a lot of what it is, is that people are just jealous of this radio show.
[00:22:31.994 --> 00:22:39.782]  You got a lot of people that are in the alternative media, a lot of people that have websites, blogs, make films, and they think I'm like floating around on cloud nine.
[00:22:40.643 --> 00:22:42.385]  And that Hollywood people and I'm so cool.
[00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:47.389]  No, what I am is a hard-working person sitting here in a office park in South Austin.
[00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.812]  Who bust my butt?
[00:22:50.392 --> 00:22:54.575]  Who's going to be working at 10 o'clock tonight in the fight against the New World Order?
[00:22:55.196 --> 00:22:57.358]  And so that's why I've been successful.
[00:22:57.638 --> 00:23:03.223]  And it just frustrates me that so much energy is spent on Alex Jones.
[00:23:03.923 --> 00:23:10.629]  I'd say maybe 20% of Internet activity that's anti-New World Order is actually about me, positive and negative.
[00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:13.391]  I've never tried.
[00:23:13.431 --> 00:23:14.772]  I mean, I could start organizations.
[00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:19.515]  I just supported Luke Radowsky and now We Are Change has hundreds of chapters everywhere.
[00:23:20.155 --> 00:23:22.137]  I mean, all these tyranny response groups are everywhere.
[00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:23.898]  All these other organizations.
[00:23:24.458 --> 00:23:25.379]  We have energized.
[00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:26.900]  My audience is energized.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.323]  I could have some big organization and be some big leader and have groups under me.
[00:23:31.503 --> 00:23:31.944]  I don't.
[00:23:32.464 --> 00:23:33.725]  I don't want to be your leader.
[00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:43.166]  If I was an egomaniac, though, I would probably form an organization and really try to reach for a lot of political power.
[00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:46.028]  But that's not even what I want.
[00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:58.778]  I understand the power of getting individuals to take action, of getting individuals to reach out, and getting individuals to expand their paradigms.
[00:23:58.918 --> 00:24:00.359]  That cannot be stopped.
[00:24:00.879 --> 00:24:04.002]  You know, if this is a movement about Alex Jones being the big leader,
[00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:06.230]  Then it can be decapitated.
[00:24:06.911 --> 00:24:11.474]  But if it is an idea, an idea, as V for Vendetta says, is bulletproof.
[00:24:11.494 --> 00:24:16.078]  So we're going to go to break, cram in some calls, and we've got Victor Ostrowski joining us after that.
[00:24:16.638 --> 00:24:21.402]  But I do want to, again, encourage listeners and thank listeners that have supported this broadcast.
[00:24:21.422 --> 00:24:24.184]  You support it by spreading the word about the radio show.
[00:24:24.645 --> 00:24:31.890]  You support it by supporting the sponsors, local AM and FM sponsors, and Genesis sponsors, and our sponsors, our web sponsors.
[00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:36.394]  And you also support us when you buy the books and videos, which are the best out there.
[00:24:36.874 --> 00:24:37.955]  That's just not me saying that.
[00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:43.880]  I mean, that's... You support it by reviewing our films, and calling the talk radio, and talking about my films.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.522]  You support it by buying the videos, or by giving us donations.

[00:24:50.525 --> 00:24:51.285]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:24:56.107 --> 00:25:01.154]  And the New World Order is not going to stop us, the haters aren't going to stop us, nobody's going to stop us, if it's God's will.
[00:25:01.194 --> 00:25:03.157]  And I believe it's God's will we succeed together.
[00:25:05.821 --> 00:25:07.182]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.282]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:26:28.976 --> 00:26:33.101]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:26:33.822 --> 00:26:34.623]  You want answers?
[00:26:35.404 --> 00:26:36.325]  Well, so does he.
[00:26:36.946 --> 00:26:40.651]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:41.151 --> 00:26:45.196]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26:46.374 --> 00:26:49.936]  Okay, my friends, we are back live, halfway into this transmission.
[00:26:50.176 --> 00:27:01.262]  Victor Ostrowski, former Israeli Navy officer, and of course, Mossad officer as well, is going to be joining us to give us his take on what's happened with Israel and the flotilla.
[00:27:01.282 --> 00:27:07.325]  Now, more ships coming, and what he thinks Israel's going to do with that situation, what Turkey's going to do.
[00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:08.505]  That's coming up.
[00:27:08.765 --> 00:27:10.987]  Let's go to Corey, Ian, and others right now.
[00:27:11.567 --> 00:27:13.208]  Ian, in England, you're on the air.
[00:27:13.268 --> 00:27:13.588]  Welcome.
[00:27:17.247 --> 00:27:18.047]  Hello there.
[00:27:18.067 --> 00:27:19.228]  Yes, yes Ian, go ahead.
[00:27:19.248 --> 00:27:22.149]  Hi, very good to hear from you.
[00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:33.995]  Yeah, I've got, and don't, please don't get upset with what I'm going to ask, but I've been very interested in your following of Machete, the movie, as it's going out.
[00:27:35.456 --> 00:27:41.639]  And I'm just wondering why we can't, I mean, you always say to validate the information.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.061]  And I've looked everywhere for a copy of the script.
[00:27:46.408 --> 00:27:51.191]  Is there any word that it is, you know, a surreptitious distribution occurred?
[00:27:52.352 --> 00:27:57.816]  Well, to be clear, I was sent the script by an unnamed person involved with the production.
[00:27:57.916 --> 00:27:58.936]  So we're just going to leave that.
[00:27:59.096 --> 00:28:05.761]  I mean, you understand the media has sources and you don't give those sources up or you don't ever get another source again.
[00:28:08.439 --> 00:28:10.220]  Yes, Alex, I totally understand that.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:27.694]  Okay, okay, so, so, and you've seen the trailer for it, and you can read the article two weeks ago, he did an interview, Rob Rodriguez, the filmmaker, with Any Cool News, and he said, I agree, there is some stuff in there that could have caused problems with what's happening in Arizona, and that he's going to cut it out of the film.
[00:28:28.454 --> 00:28:32.177]  And I shot video of the script with screenshots.
[00:28:33.038 --> 00:28:36.981]  Have you seen the video I put up with video of the pages underlined?
[00:28:38.737 --> 00:28:39.237]  Absolutely.
[00:28:39.397 --> 00:28:41.758]  Well, that's a digital reproduction.
[00:28:41.798 --> 00:28:42.879]  I mean, how do you know?
[00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:46.360]  I mean, if that could be fake, then the whole thing could be fake.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.360]  I just put out a fake script.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.442]  I mean, Rodriguez hasn't denied that I have the script.
[00:28:50.882 --> 00:28:55.023]  I mean, it's been in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the Miami Herald, the Arizona newspapers.
[00:28:55.063 --> 00:28:56.224]  It's been in the LA Times.
[00:28:56.864 --> 00:28:58.045]  It's been in the Washington Post.
[00:28:58.105 --> 00:29:01.566]  I mean, Mr. Rodriguez hasn't denied that I have the script.
[00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:03.591]  Absolutely.
[00:29:03.631 --> 00:29:08.813]  I'm not denying that what you've put up there is in any way, shape, or form... Well, I mean, look, it gets into a copyright issue.
[00:29:08.853 --> 00:29:14.936]  It's one thing for me to show a script and to show maybe 30, 40 pages of an 87-page thing.
[00:29:15.256 --> 00:29:17.977]  And that's even, you know, really a spoiler.
[00:29:18.518 --> 00:29:23.460]  But this is political, and it's news, and I'm exposing it to stop some type of race war.
[00:29:24.528 --> 00:29:24.909]  Okay.
[00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:27.972]  Uh, and so, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[00:29:28.052 --> 00:29:30.314]  I mean, you know, the trailer is what's in the movie.
[00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:31.455]  I have the script.
[00:29:31.996 --> 00:29:34.859]  And Fox, 20th Century Fox, pulled the trailer.
[00:29:36.621 --> 00:29:37.582]  I mean, what are you implying?
[00:29:37.602 --> 00:29:38.463]  I don't understand.
[00:29:39.952 --> 00:29:41.353]  No, I'm not implying anything, Alex.
[00:29:41.373 --> 00:29:42.093]  That's the whole point.
[00:29:42.153 --> 00:29:44.315]  I said at the beginning, please don't take exception to it.
[00:29:44.435 --> 00:29:51.759]  No, I know, but I'm telling you, I just feel like it's wrong to take somebody's book and publish the whole thing.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.001]  I thought it was borderline to even show the script.
[00:29:55.481 --> 00:30:08.850]  And if it was any other movie that wasn't about race war and hadn't been paralleled, and Arizona hadn't been called out, this is a message to Arizona, and if I didn't think it was a psy-op, I wouldn't have come out and reached out to the director saying, are you being used here, buddy?
[00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.712]  I mean, I was contacted by his people.
[00:30:11.432 --> 00:30:16.836]  And so it's a thin line to walk when you've got a script for a movie five, six months before it comes out.
[00:30:17.935 --> 00:30:19.076]  I guess four months before it comes out.
[00:30:20.057 --> 00:30:30.025]  So, yeah, I mean, we have the script and I'm not going to put the whole thing out because, you know, I don't want to, you know, in hindsight, he said he's cutting the race war stuff out.
[00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:35.029]  And then that even kind of feels dirty to have somebody change something because I'm putting pressure on it.
[00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:37.110]  I'm not even calling for his censorship.
[00:30:37.491 --> 00:30:38.712]  I'm just speaking out against it.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.782]  Uh, and pointing out the taxpayer money did go to it.
[00:30:42.842 --> 00:30:43.702]  What do you think of that?
[00:30:44.362 --> 00:30:47.464]  But I don't have any wish to damage Robert Rodriguez.
[00:30:48.084 --> 00:30:52.066]  And, you know, I think overall they'll end up helping his film in hindsight that we've talked about it.
[00:30:52.326 --> 00:30:55.328]  But now there'll be a counterbalance to it in the debate.
[00:30:55.908 --> 00:31:02.051]  And I think because, I mean, he did say now that he thinks about it, maybe he had too much tequila and he's going to change it.
[00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:06.833]  I mean, my job was to reach out to Robert Rodriguez and say, hey, pal, look at what you're doing.
[00:31:07.073 --> 00:31:09.354]  And as soon as he said, you know what, Alex, you're right.
[00:31:11.115 --> 00:31:12.055]  There is a problem here.
[00:31:12.135 --> 00:31:13.135]  I said, well, I respect that.
[00:31:13.175 --> 00:31:13.656]  Good job.
[00:31:14.516 --> 00:31:15.416]  So there you go.
[00:31:15.436 --> 00:31:16.377]  All right.
[00:31:16.397 --> 00:31:20.398]  We'll come back with our guests and get into the whole situation with Israel and a lot more.
[00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:21.299]  Stay with us.
[00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:21.819]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:24.008 --> 00:31:26.331]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:28.593]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:31:28.713 --> 00:31:31.897]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:31:31.937 --> 00:31:36.683]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:31:37.043 --> 00:31:41.228]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:31:41.528 --> 00:31:43.889]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:31:43.989 --> 00:31:46.410]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.331]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:31:49.692 --> 00:31:57.275]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:31:57.614 --> 00:32:02.916]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:32:03.016 --> 00:32:05.297]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:32:05.337 --> 00:32:09.298]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:32:09.558 --> 00:32:10.459]  And I got news for you.
[00:32:10.619 --> 00:32:11.939]  You're everyone else.
[00:32:11.959 --> 00:32:13.080]  Invisible Empire.

[00:32:24.534 --> 00:32:27.135]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:27.555 --> 00:32:32.496]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:32.856 --> 00:32:34.597]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:34.917 --> 00:32:39.718]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:39.918 --> 00:32:40.878]  How much do you want?
[00:32:41.098 --> 00:32:41.838]  When do you want it?
[00:32:42.218 --> 00:32:43.819]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:44.099 --> 00:32:44.919]  When will you need it?
[00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:47.240]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.420]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.041]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:50.241 --> 00:32:55.303]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:55.503 --> 00:32:58.685]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:59.105 --> 00:33:02.586]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:33:02.907 --> 00:33:03.887]  How much will you need?
[00:33:04.147 --> 00:33:04.747]  We don't know.
[00:33:05.048 --> 00:33:05.948]  How much do you want?
[00:33:06.148 --> 00:33:06.868]  All you can get.
[00:33:06.888 --> 00:33:07.869]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:10.932]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:33:11.212 --> 00:33:13.835]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:33:14.055 --> 00:33:14.856]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:14.896 --> 00:33:19.200]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:28.810]  What have we got?
[00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.191]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:33:31.492 --> 00:33:32.192]  A republic.
[00:33:32.492 --> 00:33:35.074]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:33:35.154 --> 00:33:37.056]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:33:37.416 --> 00:33:39.318]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:33:39.438 --> 00:33:40.699]  So they think they own our land?
[00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:42.240]  They think they own our water?
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:42.840]  Children?
[00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:43.841]  Our education?
[00:33:44.161 --> 00:33:44.782]  Our money?
[00:33:45.002 --> 00:33:48.645]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:33:49.005 --> 00:33:52.648]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:33:53.989 --> 00:33:54.790]  We have the facts.
[00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.111]  We have the Constitution.
[00:33:56.171 --> 00:33:57.051]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:33:57.071 --> 00:33:57.912]  We have common law.
[00:33:57.952 --> 00:34:00.214]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:00.474 --> 00:34:04.257]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:34:04.377 --> 00:34:09.161]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:10.682]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:34:10.822 --> 00:34:11.662]  Don't tread on me.
[00:34:11.903 --> 00:34:22.430]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:34:23.951 --> 00:34:29.335]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:29.355 --> 00:34:31.617]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:34:43.226 --> 00:34:45.147]  Gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:34:45.207 --> 00:34:50.129]  Eight minutes into this third hour, Viktor Ostrovsky is our guest.
[00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:54.312]  We had him on many years ago about his book, On the Other Side of Deception.
[00:34:54.792 --> 00:35:05.757]  And of course, the first book was a New York Times number one bestseller, By Way of Deception, and that turned into a big court case when the Israeli government filed a suit trying to block it.
[00:35:05.777 --> 00:35:07.038]  It went to the Supreme Court.
[00:35:08.616 --> 00:35:25.509]  And you can go to his different websites, thebookpatch.com, where alternative books can be published online, or you can go to his fine art website as well, and we'll give you both of those coming up.
[00:35:25.869 --> 00:35:27.350]  But I wanted to get him on because I saw a
[00:35:28.371 --> 00:35:34.399]  Washington Post headline yesterday where he basically criticized what happened and he called it stupid.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.445]  It was stupefying stupidity I believe was the quote.
[00:35:39.066 --> 00:35:44.053]  And he is uniquely qualified to talk about this because he was an Israeli naval commander.
[00:35:45.114 --> 00:36:00.226]  He was also the head of the Israeli Naval Weapons Development Program, and he was also a case officer in the Israeli Mossad, and then he left and spoke out about corruption, disinfo they gave the government, and other things.
[00:36:00.246 --> 00:36:07.492]  We were talking during the break before he came live, because he hadn't been on in probably four or five years or longer, and I said to him, well just to be clear,
[00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:12.113]  I'm not part of the religion of hating Israel, and I'm also not part of the religion of worshipping Israel.
[00:36:12.313 --> 00:36:16.795]  Because it seems like there's two different polarized camps, and I make both sides mad at me.
[00:36:16.855 --> 00:36:20.136]  I just think every government's corrupt and out of control, like Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:36:20.156 --> 00:36:25.698]  And I think Israel, you know, just from a layman's term, why not just stop the propellers?
[00:36:26.118 --> 00:36:27.419]  Why not just let it come in to dock?
[00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:31.060]  And, you know, then follow any weapons via satellite?
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.961]  I mean, it was definitely a PR disaster, and now you've got Turkey coming in with ships.
[00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:36.742]  You've got another flotilla coming in.
[00:36:37.122 --> 00:36:43.907]  With Nobel laureates on board and you got the North Korea situation with the U.S.
[00:36:43.927 --> 00:36:45.148]  George Washington going there.
[00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:47.409]  All these crises popping up right now.
[00:36:47.449 --> 00:36:49.611]  We couldn't have a better guest on than Victor.
[00:36:50.111 --> 00:36:55.695]  So, Victor, break it down for us first your experience in the Israeli Navy and then in the Mossad.
[00:36:55.715 --> 00:37:00.038]  I mean, I can't think of anybody better to speak about this than the point you made in the Washington Post that
[00:37:00.498 --> 00:37:06.001]  You believe the actual boots on the ground who have the expertise were ignored and that Netanyahu and others were running this.
[00:37:06.421 --> 00:37:13.204]  So we'll talk about your history, what you think happened, what was wrong, and what you think they'll do next knowing their mindset.
[00:37:14.563 --> 00:37:29.061]  First of all, this kind of united all the extremists in Israel, you know, shouting... Actually, when you read in the Israeli papers, the commentary after the articles, they're saying, well, let them come again, we'll send them back in coffins.
[00:37:29.241 --> 00:37:31.624]  I mean, this is the kind of, you know...
[00:37:34.406 --> 00:37:37.589]  Crowd mentality that you get when things like that take place.
[00:37:38.209 --> 00:37:53.622]  Netanyahu already announced today that he's willing to consider changing in the blockade, changes in the blockade on Gaza and bring in international forces that would be helpful in checking the materials that are coming in and out.
[00:37:54.863 --> 00:37:59.887]  So basically what they tried to do with this flotilla had succeeded.
[00:38:00.747 --> 00:38:12.817]  They wanted to point to a situation which is very disastrous, very bad for the reputation of Israel, this blockade holding so many people in such a dire strait.
[00:38:14.438 --> 00:38:20.322]  The stupidity, in my opinion, was on the tactical side, not necessarily just the political.
[00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:33.467]  You know, sometimes I look at people and you see all the actors and all these people come and talk about politics and what they would do and whatever, and just because people know their name, they think they have a right to an opinion.
[00:38:34.128 --> 00:38:37.710]  I'm not a politician, so put that aside.
[00:38:38.832 --> 00:38:40.473]  Look at the tactical side of it.
[00:38:40.973 --> 00:38:46.276]  Here come ships loaded with civilians who you know what they are carrying.
[00:38:46.797 --> 00:38:48.438]  You know there are no weapons aboard.
[00:38:48.498 --> 00:38:50.439]  The Turkish government has checked that.
[00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:51.599]  It is your ally.
[00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:57.823]  You're about to have a military exercise with the Turks in the Mediterranean.
[00:38:58.103 --> 00:38:59.704]  So it's not really an enemy, right?
[00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:02.368]  And they're saying there are no weapons aboard.
[00:39:02.728 --> 00:39:09.171]  So, you know, take the steps and make it, like, try to stop them outside the territorial water.
[00:39:09.391 --> 00:39:10.631]  The Navy can do that.
[00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:16.854]  The Israeli Navy, the Israeli commandos, probably the best in the world in doing that, after the SEALs, the American SEALs.
[00:39:17.834 --> 00:39:19.595]  They could have stopped them quietly.
[00:39:19.655 --> 00:39:22.016]  The guys on board would not even know what happened.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:37.946]  But first of all, even though you have the San Remo Naval, you know, manual that allows you to board ships if you have an embargo on an area outside your territorial waters, why go there?
[00:39:38.567 --> 00:39:41.528]  Why not let them cross into the territorial waters?
[00:39:42.128 --> 00:39:43.729]  It's still way out of range.
[00:39:43.809 --> 00:39:45.830]  I mean, you're talking about 12, 14 miles.
[00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:47.671]  Let them in.
[00:39:48.231 --> 00:39:48.531]  And then
[00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:54.557]  Take whatever exercise you do, so at least you're taking one bad block off the table.
[00:39:54.877 --> 00:39:56.438]  You're not in international water.
[00:39:57.138 --> 00:40:03.721]  Secondly, the raid itself, the way they came into the ship, that was stupid.
[00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:06.142]  I mean, I've worked with these commandos.
[00:40:06.202 --> 00:40:09.224]  You can come down from a helicopter four at a time.
[00:40:09.544 --> 00:40:15.067]  They chose to come down one at a time because of the narrow area that they had at the top of the ship.
[00:40:15.672 --> 00:40:17.133]  Who comes in the top of the ship?
[00:40:17.173 --> 00:40:21.495]  Why not at the bow or the stern where you have at least two or three areas that are protected?
[00:40:22.956 --> 00:40:24.397]  The whole operation was stupid.
[00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:29.019]  You clearly saw that this was something that was kind of pulled at the last minute.
[00:40:29.399 --> 00:40:31.340]  Like somebody was shouting, go, go, go, go, go.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.181]  We don't have any time.
[00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:32.621]  Let's do it.
[00:40:32.641 --> 00:40:33.081]  Let's do it.
[00:40:34.022 --> 00:40:36.523]  Without and they had months to plan for this.
[00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:43.703]  So, there goes my stupid, and it's stupid... Well, I think it would have been politically smarter just to let the ships in.
[00:40:43.743 --> 00:40:47.606]  If you know they were searched in Turkey, you know there's not weapons other than clubs.
[00:40:48.287 --> 00:40:49.788]  Let them bring the aid into Gaza.
[00:40:50.128 --> 00:40:51.950]  Well, now you're talking on the political side.
[00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.890]  Here's the problem.
[00:40:53.251 --> 00:41:05.941]  The Israelis have stopped the bringing in of supplies into Gaza to a point where, for example, you can bring in, you know, cinnamon, but you can't bring in cardamom.
[00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:14.552]  They have lists of things that the soldiers and the officers are busy making sure what comes in and what doesn't come in.
[00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:17.252]  The blockade is not just against weapons.
[00:41:17.312 --> 00:41:26.654]  They're not allowing construction materials like concrete and metal, because they're saying the metal will be used for missiles, the concrete will be used for bunkers.
[00:41:27.454 --> 00:41:33.836]  They don't, and yet they have, and this is after the last raid into Gaza, which demolished, you know, 35% of all
[00:41:35.683 --> 00:41:35.903]  I think
[00:41:59.255 --> 00:41:59.395]  Yes.
[00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.127]  You're going to be suffering.
[00:42:18.668 --> 00:42:20.568]  And that's against the Geneva Convention.
[00:42:20.628 --> 00:42:21.428]  It's against everything else.
[00:42:21.448 --> 00:42:28.710]  You cannot... And that's also, historically, just going to turn the population who wasn't radicalized to Hamas and only make them dig in.
[00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:29.470]  Absolutely.
[00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.211]  And we know that.
[00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:42.373]  I mean, you know... I mean, the bottom line, there's a... The philosophy that always was prevalent in Israel was you can't fight ideas with force.
[00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:45.334]  The only way you fight an idea is with a better idea.
[00:42:46.094 --> 00:42:47.055]  I don't
[00:43:03.985 --> 00:43:04.786]  And it didn't help.
[00:43:04.806 --> 00:43:06.287]  We kept bringing in people.
[00:43:06.347 --> 00:43:07.308]  We brought in arms.
[00:43:07.408 --> 00:43:09.310]  We, you know, we fought them off.
[00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:13.554]  Because the stronger they fought, the harder we fought back.
[00:43:14.135 --> 00:43:16.397]  This is the way people are.
[00:43:17.278 --> 00:43:18.859]  There are three kinds of terrorism.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.224]  There's psychological or what's called ideological.
[00:43:23.866 --> 00:43:30.568]  Terrorists, you have the territorial terrorists, and you have the, you know, the Looney Tunes.
[00:43:30.909 --> 00:43:36.871]  Well, the Looney Tunes and the ideological ones you can usually beat, but the territorial ones you can't.
[00:43:37.351 --> 00:43:40.172]  These are people fighting for freedom on their land.
[00:43:40.692 --> 00:43:42.673]  They almost always succeed.
[00:43:42.913 --> 00:43:48.275]  I mean, take it from the, starting from the American Revolution, and you go through every
[00:43:49.406 --> 00:43:49.826]  Time.
[00:43:49.866 --> 00:43:54.687]  You've got Vietnam, you've got the 80s with the Afghans and the Russians.
[00:43:55.247 --> 00:43:56.208]  I mean... It's always.
[00:43:56.488 --> 00:43:56.968]  It's always.
[00:43:57.048 --> 00:44:08.571]  And the people who have the ideological ones, which used to be like the Butter Meinhof or the Red Army Brigades or any one of those, they have disappeared in time.
[00:44:09.131 --> 00:44:14.592]  That's why al-Qaeda, for example, tries to latch itself on to a territorial
[00:44:15.372 --> 00:44:33.084]  That's why Al-Qaeda wants to be tied in with groups like the Hamas, like the people in Yemen, because they need a territorial background and a suffering of a people to recruit new people to their lines.
[00:44:34.585 --> 00:44:37.948]  The Gaza is like the magnet
[00:44:38.775 --> 00:44:40.036]  It's the Mecca!
[00:44:40.116 --> 00:44:41.097]  It's the Mecca!
[00:45:04.542 --> 00:45:14.504]  It's incredible, and the time we've got, I want to get into your books and some of the things you criticized the Israeli government and the Mossad did when you were involved in it, and also the Navy.
[00:45:15.405 --> 00:45:24.347]  But you talked about militarily, if they were going to do this, you would go in an open-top wet submarine, or basically a glorified underwater sea-doo.
[00:45:25.487 --> 00:45:34.173]  And then basically, there's a lot of different ways to disable those propellers, and then it doesn't give the people wanting to have this big standoff a spectacular event.
[00:45:34.533 --> 00:45:38.156]  Because, you know, at a base level, people always cheer for the underdog.
[00:45:38.576 --> 00:45:42.699]  You got folks, you know, with clubs getting shot by commandos.
[00:45:43.099 --> 00:45:48.643]  I mean, that, any way you slice it, is going to be a PR disaster for Israel.
[00:45:48.963 --> 00:45:51.705]  And again, I'm no genius about all this stuff, but I can see that.
[00:45:51.745 --> 00:45:54.827]  I mean, it seems like a five-year-old can mentally work through all this.
[00:45:55.911 --> 00:45:56.451]  Absolutely.
[00:45:59.152 --> 00:45:59.933]  It's stupefying.
[00:45:59.973 --> 00:46:17.179]  I mean, how do you even explain it when you have the Israeli government responding and saying, okay, they came down with commandos on board ships in the middle of the night from a helicopter, and then they're saying that the people defending themselves are attacking the soldiers?
[00:46:17.739 --> 00:46:20.620]  I mean, even the explanation is stupid.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.480]  Stay there, Victor.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.701]  This is Key Info coming up.
[00:46:23.527 --> 00:46:27.751]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:46:28.071 --> 00:46:32.135]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:37.821]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:46:38.161 --> 00:46:38.602]  It's true.
[00:46:38.902 --> 00:46:44.324]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:46:44.584 --> 00:46:47.886]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:46:48.186 --> 00:46:51.908]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:46:52.888 --> 00:46:55.249]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:46:55.649 --> 00:46:59.031]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:47:00.131 --> 00:47:03.993]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:47:04.253 --> 00:47:09.019]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:47:09.319 --> 00:47:13.344]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:47:13.484 --> 00:47:15.046]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:47:15.286 --> 00:47:19.891]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:47:23.559 --> 00:47:26.262]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:47:26.502 --> 00:47:30.466]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:47:30.666 --> 00:47:32.728]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:47:32.929 --> 00:47:37.974]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:47:38.094 --> 00:47:39.855]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:41.237]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:47:41.437 --> 00:47:42.898]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:47:42.938 --> 00:47:46.020]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:51.344]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:47:51.684 --> 00:48:00.771]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:01.531]  We're good to go.
[00:48:24.884 --> 00:48:26.567]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:48:27.388 --> 00:48:28.289]  Tyranny is here.
[00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:32.275]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:48:32.315 --> 00:48:34.799]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:48:34.819 --> 00:48:40.207]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:48:40.667 --> 00:48:46.955]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:52.902]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:48:53.322 --> 00:48:57.027]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:48:57.507 --> 00:49:01.508]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:49:01.788 --> 00:49:07.310]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:10.751]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:49:11.271 --> 00:49:12.711]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:49:13.251 --> 00:49:13.792]  It's here.

[00:49:22.494 --> 00:49:23.174]  Fatigue.
[00:49:23.634 --> 00:49:24.154]  Headaches.
[00:49:24.735 --> 00:49:25.615]  Allergies and asthma.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:30.860]  I think so.
[00:50:00.942 --> 00:50:01.622]  We're good to go.
[00:50:27.643 --> 00:50:38.852]  Victor Ostrowski is our guest naval commander, the head of their naval weapons program, and then of course recruited to be a case officer for the Israeli Mossad.
[00:50:40.663 --> 00:50:43.366]  And he's authored two non-fiction books about his service in the Mossad.
[00:50:43.386 --> 00:50:51.113]  We're going to tell you about his website, TheBookPatch.com, coming up, or OstrovskyFineArt.com.
[00:50:51.594 --> 00:50:52.555]  This is a short segment.
[00:50:53.035 --> 00:50:56.078]  You were finishing up with the plight of what's happening in Gaza.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.543]  And then I want you to elaborate on the mindset of the Likudniks.
[00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:07.187]  Uh, who say, hey, we got 400 nukes and, you know, we're just ready to go wild.
[00:51:07.227 --> 00:51:10.069]  I mean, basically, I mean, chutzpah is the word.
[00:51:10.389 --> 00:51:16.993]  And then expanding on that, uh, what you see happening with Turkey, they're saying they're going to send naval ships in.
[00:51:17.013 --> 00:51:25.158]  Uh, they're saying that, you know, more ships from Ireland and Malta, uh, and, and other places are coming.
[00:51:25.178 --> 00:51:27.700]  And, and what do you expect Israel to do?
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:33.766]  Well, according to the Prime Minister, he's already starting to feel that he's under U.S.
[00:51:33.806 --> 00:51:37.671]  pressure and that he just may ease the Gaza siege.
[00:51:37.931 --> 00:51:39.293]  I mean, there's no question about that.
[00:51:39.753 --> 00:51:42.616]  And easing it in a way that he would kind of like
[00:51:43.637 --> 00:51:55.042]  Backtrack, but not lose face to his own party, which is an extreme right-wing party in Israel, which has people like Lieberman and others who are extremely right-wing.
[00:51:55.062 --> 00:52:01.864]  I mean, these are people who are calling for any citizen in Israel to make an oath of allegiance to Israel as a Jewish state.
[00:52:01.924 --> 00:52:11.108]  Now, that would be a problem for a lot of Palestinians who are not Jewish, and he wants them to lose their citizenship should they not be willing to make that oath.
[00:52:12.248 --> 00:52:14.249]  So that's the kind of people we're dealing with.
[00:52:14.489 --> 00:52:17.650]  So Netanyahu is caught between the rock and the hard place.
[00:52:18.151 --> 00:52:22.452]  Even if he wants to compromise, he has to do it in a way that he shows that he's not losing face.
[00:52:23.893 --> 00:52:34.197]  He will try and give some leniency towards materials coming in, and that would alleviate the situation in the Gaza Strip without a question.
[00:52:35.262 --> 00:52:43.670]  Turkey may, may, I don't think they will, but they may send, you know, an escort, a military escort with those ships.
[00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:46.513]  Then the question is, do you actually confront them?
[00:52:47.554 --> 00:52:50.777]  Do you put Israeli ships to confront Turkish ships?
[00:52:52.498 --> 00:52:54.979]  That I don't think is something Israel would want to do.
[00:52:55.039 --> 00:52:59.280]  Now the Turkish ships would not cross into Israeli waters.
[00:52:59.341 --> 00:53:05.143]  They would probably stop in the international water on the line if that were to happen.
[00:53:06.886 --> 00:53:11.871]  Now, we're dealing with countries here that are easy to get, you know, to heat up.
[00:53:12.252 --> 00:53:19.620]  You know, Turkey, with all due respect, is not exactly your, you know, your angel in the area.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.383]  I mean, they're dealing with the Kurds in a way that, you know, nobody wants to.
[00:53:23.444 --> 00:53:27.448]  They're preventing them from their own languages and there's a lot of things they have there.
[00:53:27.928 --> 00:53:37.171]  Yeah, Turkey's got a military iron fist and basically a front government, and that's on record, and that's going to destabilize Turkey if they are put into a confrontation with Israel.
[00:53:37.371 --> 00:53:49.394]  Absolutely, and it's an internal problem that they have to solve too, and Erdogan, who is, you know, trying to show a face to the Muslim world in what he's doing, is... basically this whole situation has four
[00:53:49.394 --> 00:53:49.674]  We're good.
[00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:13.061]  I think so.
[00:54:32.473 --> 00:54:52.601]  Had they stopped them out in the water, like you said before, with those what's called wet submarines, which is really a torpedo, a large torpedo with two or three or six seats in it that people are, you know, divers are in it with their oxygen tanks and whatever, they could have come close to the rear end of those ships and stopped them without nobody on board even knowing what happened.
[00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:58.143]  They could have boarded these ships in a way that would be a lot easier to handle.
[00:54:58.183 --> 00:54:58.403]  I mean,
[00:54:59.247 --> 00:55:10.552]  Again, they basically almost started the riot by, you know, they threw tear gas grenades first before they came off the helicopters and then figured that's what's going to happen.
[00:55:10.592 --> 00:55:15.134]  And now some of them are saying, well, we came down with paintball rifles.
[00:55:15.614 --> 00:55:18.856]  Well, OK, even if they had paintball rifles, which I doubt,
[00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:23.463]  How does the guy on the ground know that what's aiming at him is a paintball rifle?
[00:55:23.483 --> 00:55:26.084]  Well, how do all these people get killed if it's paintball?
[00:55:26.264 --> 00:55:28.286]  Well, and here's the funny part.
[00:55:28.766 --> 00:55:31.667]  They say paintball rifles, but then they say, well, they shot at us.
[00:55:32.027 --> 00:55:35.669]  They say, but they didn't have any, the people in the ship did not have any weapons.
[00:55:35.729 --> 00:55:39.632]  They said, yeah, but they took some weapons from Israeli soldiers and then shot at them.
[00:55:39.932 --> 00:55:45.875]  Well, how is it that when an Israeli soldier shoots, it's a paintball rifle, and when he's shot back, it's a real gun?
[00:55:46.315 --> 00:55:50.039]  It's amazing propaganda, but just to be clear earlier, we're going to break.
[00:55:50.479 --> 00:55:51.780]  We'll get the answer when we come back.
[00:55:52.701 --> 00:55:57.546]  You're saying that it's good the people were defending themselves, or that's a normal response.
[00:55:57.786 --> 00:56:00.889]  I mean, that's what I got from what you said before the last break.
[00:56:01.229 --> 00:56:02.110]  So stay there, sir.
[00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:03.251]  We'll come back, long segment.
[00:56:03.911 --> 00:56:04.892]  Get your take on that.
[00:56:06.314 --> 00:56:10.998]  And then we'll overall talk about the state of Israel, period, and where you see the whole world going.
[00:56:11.298 --> 00:56:11.699]  Stay with us.
[00:56:13.018 --> 00:56:16.024]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:56:16.945 --> 00:56:19.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:26.330]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:32.611]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:56:32.971 --> 00:56:40.052]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:56:40.352 --> 00:56:44.933]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:56:45.233 --> 00:56:47.354]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:56:50.174 --> 00:56:53.719]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:56:53.879 --> 00:56:57.624]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:56:58.143 --> 00:57:04.329]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:08.333]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:57:08.793 --> 00:57:15.080]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:15.960]  Thank you.
[00:57:23.393 --> 00:57:31.498]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:57:31.878 --> 00:57:42.324]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:57:42.764 --> 00:57:48.187]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:57:48.747 --> 00:57:53.230]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:57:53.650 --> 00:58:02.356]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:58:02.716 --> 00:58:12.543]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:17.526]  That's www.SilverLungs.com SilverLungs.com
[00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:23.411]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:23.431 --> 00:58:28.776]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:29.016 --> 00:58:33.640]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:39.085]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:58:39.605 --> 00:58:44.308]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:46.770]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:51.753]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:58:51.953 --> 00:58:52.854]  And here's the best part.
[00:58:53.074 --> 00:58:55.836]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:58:56.136 --> 00:58:59.438]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:58:59.759 --> 00:59:02.600]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:02.941 --> 00:59:04.842]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:05.162 --> 00:59:06.103]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:09.725 --> 00:59:11.508]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:13.971 --> 00:59:18.478]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:18.798 --> 00:59:21.182]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:28.049 --> 00:59:29.871]  We're going back to our guest here in a moment.
[00:59:29.951 --> 00:59:34.976]  I may even keep him a little bit in the next hour, if he can do it, to take a few calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:34.996 --> 00:59:42.624]  Wanted to remind you, we have an online video bookstore, ShoppingCard, at Infowars.com.
[00:59:43.265 --> 00:59:48.970]  And my film, Fall of the Republic, exposes how there's a global corporate takeover of every sovereign nation on Earth.
[00:59:50.152 --> 00:59:52.976]  And how these big banks have sold derivatives to the nation states.
[00:59:53.337 --> 00:59:57.082]  This is just a form of neo-colonialism and a stealth empire.
[00:59:57.162 --> 00:59:59.907]  And if we're aware of this system, it will not succeed.
[01:00:00.327 --> 01:00:01.529]  And it's already in deep trouble.
[01:00:02.355 --> 01:00:06.138]  So be sure and get Fall of the Republic, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:06.718 --> 01:00:08.560]  A two-hour film with expanded extras.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.861]  Such an important documentary.
[01:00:10.241 --> 01:00:14.605]  Jason Burmess' Invisible Empire and Who Will It Define just came out about a month and a half ago.
[01:00:15.225 --> 01:00:17.847]  Getting into the globalists and their overall master operation.
[01:00:18.187 --> 01:00:24.372]  And of course, a solution video, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, with myself, Michael Bagnerik, Charles Keeb.
[01:00:25.373 --> 01:00:25.674]  I think so.
[01:00:43.677 --> 01:00:47.159]  3-1-3-9, or you can also write to us at P.O.
[01:00:47.199 --> 01:00:50.101]  Box 1-9-5-4-9, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:00:51.262 --> 01:00:53.503]  When you're on the site, check out some of the specials and combos.
[01:00:53.803 --> 01:00:59.366]  We've got videos as low as $5.95 apiece, and your purchase of the films also makes this broadcast possible.
[01:00:59.607 --> 01:01:04.429]  You can also see all my films, and a lot of other films, like Don't Tread on Me, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:08.532]  If you're a member at PrisonPlanet.tv, we also stream the live show.
[01:01:08.892 --> 01:01:11.274]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is Weapons Universe.
[01:01:12.014 --> 01:01:13.195]  We have a great sponsor.
[01:01:13.595 --> 01:01:16.937]  You're going to love these folks for everything you can imagine for your self-defense need.
[01:01:16.957 --> 01:01:21.180]  And you need to go to Weapons-Universe.com.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.982]  Weapons-Universe.com.
[01:01:23.382 --> 01:01:29.406]  Whether you need knives, stun guns, blow guns, collapsible batons, they have it all at Weapons-Universe.com.
[01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:35.150]  They have authentic movie replica swords like the one made out of folded steel from the movie Conan.
[01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:35.731]  They sent me one.
[01:01:35.771 --> 01:01:36.271]  It's awesome.
[01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:36.911]  Made in Spain.
[01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:37.892]  This is nice stuff.
[01:01:38.332 --> 01:01:40.194]  You won't find a better selection of brand-named
[01:01:40.994 --> 01:01:45.158]  Like Cold Steel, Spy Draco, and Smith & Wesson.
[01:01:45.198 --> 01:01:49.521]  Weapons-Universe.com is the largest selection and some of the best prices you'll find anywhere.
[01:01:49.782 --> 01:01:53.665]  Weapons-Universe.com or check on the link at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:53.685 --> 01:01:54.806]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:01:54.866 --> 01:01:56.627]  Weapons-Universe.com.
[01:01:56.907 --> 01:01:58.108]  And speaking of great info...
[01:01:59.109 --> 01:02:04.033]  Because they tried to censor his best-selling books, he set up thebookpatch.com.
[01:02:04.493 --> 01:02:10.818]  Victor Ostrowski, again, former Israeli naval commander in the Mossad, case officer, commander.
[01:02:11.398 --> 01:02:13.520]  Tell us about thebookpatch.com.
[01:02:14.127 --> 01:02:18.191]  Well, the Book Hatch is a website that is designed for writers of all kinds.
[01:02:18.952 --> 01:02:19.873]  It's absolutely free.
[01:02:20.133 --> 01:02:22.556]  You go there and you can start writing your book.
[01:02:22.576 --> 01:02:29.743]  We have writing tools that are not available anywhere that I designed for myself and then made it available on that site.
[01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:31.151]  You can write there.
[01:02:31.191 --> 01:02:32.972]  You can invite your friends to join you.
[01:02:33.052 --> 01:02:34.853]  You can co-author with others.
[01:02:34.953 --> 01:02:36.034]  You can communicate.
[01:02:36.074 --> 01:02:39.436]  You can write from anywhere that you have an internet connection.
[01:02:40.216 --> 01:02:44.619]  You can use the site to have other people read your chapters and comment.
[01:02:44.639 --> 01:02:47.721]  You can hire or get editors to help you do that.
[01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:51.864]  And when you're done and everything is finished, you can press a button and get it.
[01:02:52.324 --> 01:02:57.968]  Either download it as a PDF to yourself or order a real hard copy, you know, book.
[01:02:58.388 --> 01:02:59.749]  You can order a single copy.
[01:03:00.469 --> 01:03:12.776]  And, you know, you can get your first book for like $16, and then it goes down by the time you reach book number 10, you're less than about $8 or $7 a copy.
[01:03:13.116 --> 01:03:18.239]  Wow, so that's a very affordable books on demand, but really one-stop shop.
[01:03:18.659 --> 01:03:21.001]  Absolutely, and you don't have to order them.
[01:03:21.081 --> 01:03:25.923]  In fact, if you finish writing it, you can put it in the bookstore and other people will order it, and then they buy it.
[01:03:25.943 --> 01:03:28.765]  You don't have to order books, you don't have to put any expenditure out.
[01:03:29.546 --> 01:03:38.475]  I mean, I think people who have a talent or have something to say and want to have a book out don't have to go into a big spending spree in order to get one in their hand.
[01:03:38.535 --> 01:03:43.760]  I think it should be something that's really easy and cheap and inexpensive.
[01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:45.382]  That's
[01:03:59.838 --> 01:04:05.340]  I mean, I don't want you to look into a crystal ball because none of us have one, but what do you think is most likely to happen?
[01:04:29.588 --> 01:04:32.730]  Well, I think that the ships are going to continue coming.
[01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:34.111]  There's no question about that.
[01:04:35.312 --> 01:04:36.853]  And you can understand why.
[01:04:37.893 --> 01:04:41.516]  There is people in suffering, and there is a need to help.
[01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:43.797]  So this is just one covers the other.
[01:04:44.758 --> 01:04:46.559]  And there is a force trying to stop them.
[01:04:47.139 --> 01:04:53.303]  And people feel that they're justified in doing it, and more and more volunteers will join and make that happen.
[01:04:54.404 --> 01:04:57.225]  It's kind of like, you know, fighting the good fight, so to speak.
[01:04:58.723 --> 01:05:18.475]  What would happen is that Israel will find a way, and I think that's what they're working on now, to allow the ship closer in, to surround it in a way that it's not harmful to the people on board, and to show that they're allowing the material to come down, but they don't want the big presentation.
[01:05:19.475 --> 01:05:21.817]  That is the best, smart way to do it.
[01:05:21.897 --> 01:05:22.337]  But again,
[01:05:24.241 --> 01:05:37.946]  Considering the fact that we're dealing with the same people who send commandos in the middle of the night to drop onto a ship, fully armed, and then complain that they were being attacked, then, you know, uh...
[01:05:38.703 --> 01:05:39.424]  What do you say?
[01:05:39.584 --> 01:05:41.465]  I mean, what could you... Well, that's another point.
[01:05:41.585 --> 01:05:45.929]  I mean, there's that archetypal thing of men lowering down in the night.
[01:05:46.889 --> 01:05:48.150]  That's when the bad guys come.
[01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:49.651]  That's right, and you're scared of that.
[01:05:49.671 --> 01:05:51.173]  I mean, wouldn't you be scared?
[01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:58.898]  I mean, what would you... Now, don't forget, we're talking about people that have been dealing with Israel on the sharp side of the bayonet.
[01:05:59.799 --> 01:06:03.961]  Yeah, a lot of the people on that boat have family or cousins or friends that are dead.
[01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:17.687]  I would not know.
[01:06:18.088 --> 01:06:21.389]  I don't know, but I know a lot of them are volunteers who have heard about this.
[01:06:21.469 --> 01:06:23.410]  Some of them were former Gazans, yeah.
[01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:24.091]  Yes, yes.
[01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:30.674]  And some of them are people that have never been back to Israel and their families have been evicted in 1948.
[01:06:31.474 --> 01:06:34.055]  So you don't know, but there's a lot of tension going on.
[01:06:34.435 --> 01:06:37.317]  And now when they're being attacked, they have no idea or no
[01:06:37.737 --> 01:06:41.040]  They can believe that, you know, the soldiers are coming to kill them.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.901]  I mean, they don't know.
[01:06:43.341 --> 01:06:49.906]  And it's not like the Israelis came down from the helicopter, you know, threw down ballots and said, we're coming in in a force.
[01:06:50.267 --> 01:06:51.328]  Do not resist us.
[01:06:51.668 --> 01:06:52.869]  You know, we will fire it.
[01:06:53.149 --> 01:06:58.273]  They just came down those ropes and the people and to say that they were had weapons.
[01:06:58.985 --> 01:07:00.546]  I mean, they're showing kitchen knives.
[01:07:01.006 --> 01:07:04.147]  Show me a cruise ship that doesn't have kitchen knives.
[01:07:04.267 --> 01:07:05.127]  Or binoculars.
[01:07:05.848 --> 01:07:07.188]  What kind of weapons are those?
[01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:11.650]  Well, they're calling binoculars night vision, but expanding on that...
[01:07:15.692 --> 01:07:34.488]  A Arab member of the Israeli Knesset is on record, you've probably seen this, saying that Israel wanted high casualties to intimidate people from coming, but watching the video, and correct me if you think I'm wrong, it doesn't really look like that, it just looks like Laurel and Hardy basically.
[01:07:34.688 --> 01:07:35.188]  Absolutely.
[01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.629]  You know what?
[01:07:36.749 --> 01:07:48.514]  There is no way, no legitimate government in Israel, and I don't care if they're right-wing or left-wing or center, would send people out to, you know, go kill them.
[01:07:49.075 --> 01:07:55.878]  Anybody who says that doesn't know what the hell they're talking about because that would not happen and nobody would ever dare even say that.
[01:07:55.898 --> 01:07:58.019]  Well, it wouldn't happen because it would be a PR disaster.
[01:07:58.462 --> 01:08:02.787]  Well, no, it wouldn't happen because that is not what Israelis are about.
[01:08:03.127 --> 01:08:06.932]  That's not, you know, that's taking it to a degree that it's not there.
[01:08:07.212 --> 01:08:09.334]  Let me expand on that since you brought that up.
[01:08:09.735 --> 01:08:18.645]  What about the USS Liberty that two years ago that they did declassify the NSA intercepts that Israel was not being honest about why they attacked that ship?
[01:08:18.965 --> 01:08:20.946]  Well, let me tell you this about the Liberty.
[01:08:21.186 --> 01:08:22.027]  I was in the Navy.
[01:08:22.087 --> 01:08:24.088]  I was not in the Navy at the time that it happened.
[01:08:24.288 --> 01:08:36.034]  I can tell you categorically, okay, from my knowledge of the people who were involved at the time in the Israeli Navy, categorically, and you can see that I'm not somebody who goes out to defend Israel.
[01:08:37.035 --> 01:08:38.936]  Categorically, this was an accident.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.903]  Now, there was a lot of screw-ups on the way.
[01:08:42.684 --> 01:08:44.727]  I have spoken to many people of the Liberty.
[01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.669]  I have said this again and again.
[01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:55.320]  There was an ambassador from Lebanon, an American ambassador in Lebanon, who said, and this was, he was making a speech, and I was on the phone.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.862]  I was on a remote
[01:08:57.282 --> 01:08:58.383]  You know, contact.
[01:08:58.763 --> 01:09:11.974]  And he said that he personally heard Israeli pilots talking to each other and saying that they recognize or they notified or they saw the flag that was being waved and that's an American ship and they said, doesn't matter, let's go attack anyway.
[01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:15.597]  And then I turned to him and I spoke to him in Hebrew.
[01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:19.299]  And he did not respond because he said he doesn't understand Hebrew.
[01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:22.502]  So I asked him, how did you hear their voices saying that?
[01:09:22.522 --> 01:09:26.105]  Because you think the Israeli pilots were talking English just for you?
[01:09:27.736 --> 01:09:31.599]  And he kind of backed off, and he said, no, I read it in the transcripts.
[01:09:31.639 --> 01:09:34.120]  I said, but you just said you heard them in your own ears.
[01:09:35.161 --> 01:09:36.021]  And it went on and on.
[01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:41.645]  There's a lot of fabrication going on about that particular piece, but I can tell you categorically, knowing the people.
[01:09:41.965 --> 01:09:53.552]  I also know that the head of the Israeli Navy at the time was not found anywhere, and everybody was looking for him because they had the skunk on the radars, a skunk being an unidentified ship.
[01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:58.414]  And he was nowhere to be had because he was having an affair in the middle of the war.
[01:09:58.434 --> 01:10:03.859]  So, you know, not everybody came out smelling well from that, but that was not a deliberate act.
[01:10:05.036 --> 01:10:09.358]  And the mistakes were, you know, colossal.
[01:10:10.499 --> 01:10:30.187]  Well, I've interviewed the admirals, and they're all dead now, but those interviews are there, and they said that when they got on the phone to McNamara and said, we're sending ships to defend, McNamara said, no, you're not to, and they refused his order, and then LBJ came on and said, look, that ship's going to the GD bottom, and that basically it was a pre-done deal to blame it on Egypt, but you're saying that isn't the deal.
[01:10:30.807 --> 01:10:31.408]  No, no, no.
[01:10:31.508 --> 01:10:32.688]  You're mixing two things.
[01:10:33.068 --> 01:10:41.872]  The fact that there was a cover-up after that, and that American ships or forces were not sent to aid, and all that, that is accurate.
[01:10:41.952 --> 01:10:42.913]  I don't know about that.
[01:10:43.013 --> 01:10:44.693]  I can't say to that anything.
[01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:55.278]  I can only say that the attack on the ship itself was not a deliberate act by the Israeli Navy or the Israeli Air Force, and nobody who fired at any point has
[01:10:56.164 --> 01:10:57.005]  No, I don't think so.
[01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.500]  This is all I can tell you.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.827]  I mean, I can't get into a lot of detail about it because of the fact that I have not been there.
[01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:26.909]  But I know the people that were involved.
[01:11:27.429 --> 01:11:37.218]  And on a personal level, this is completely on a personal level, I can vouch for every one of them knowing that none of the people I know would have opened fire on an American ship.
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.621]  Yeah, take it for what it's worth.
[01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:44.475]  Yeah, well, from my research, it looks like a live-action Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:11:44.695 --> 01:11:47.316]  I mean, again, I'm not... No, no, no.
[01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:48.377]  No, actually not.
[01:11:49.797 --> 01:12:01.361]  Now, where I find it hard to fathom, what I do find hard to fathom is the fact that the airplanes, the planes did not see the flag.
[01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:02.621]  Now, I don't know.
[01:12:02.701 --> 01:12:07.243]  Now, maybe a pilot was strafing and he saw the flag at the last minute and he doesn't want to admit it.
[01:12:07.383 --> 01:12:08.523]  That could have been the case.
[01:12:09.872 --> 01:12:10.533]  I don't know.
[01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:14.494]  I've seen the footage from the machine gun cameras, right?
[01:12:14.614 --> 01:12:19.196]  And when it passes over, you don't see any flag at that point.
[01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:22.338]  And in fact, that is available in the Israeli Navy book.
[01:12:22.998 --> 01:12:23.838]  I have a copy of that book.
[01:12:23.878 --> 01:12:24.098]  No, I know.
[01:12:24.118 --> 01:12:25.599]  I've seen the footage on television.
[01:12:25.619 --> 01:12:29.461]  It's a gray gun pod camera.
[01:12:29.501 --> 01:12:34.723]  You see a big black blob, but his eyes weren't shooting black and white film.
[01:12:34.923 --> 01:12:35.464]  Absolutely.
[01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:36.545]  I can't argue with that.
[01:12:36.605 --> 01:12:37.406]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:41.051]  I can tell you from the Navy standpoint, the people who were on board
[01:12:42.203 --> 01:12:46.206]  Okay, well that's your take on it.
[01:12:46.286 --> 01:12:48.348]  I don't want to burn up all of our time.
[01:12:49.529 --> 01:13:09.003]  Separately, you've written two books and I remember one account about the Israelis, what, submarine jacking in to a Libyan communications facility and sending out false flag info that then got Reagan to send in the aardvarks and blow up Gaddafi's tents.
[01:13:09.564 --> 01:13:11.305]  Break that down for us and talk about your books.
[01:13:11.505 --> 01:13:29.931]  Well, okay, this was written in The Other Side of Deception, which is my second non-fictional book, and I described there what happened was there were Mossad units with special forces that came in and installed a bounce-off device, which is kind of like a... it's a communication system that
[01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:42.391]  You can broadcast to it from some location, it then takes the communication that you've sent to it and will bounce it off as if it's coming from a source very close to where it's located.
[01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:58.295]  In fact, they put it in an apartment building which was a block and a half or two blocks away, I don't remember exactly, from the Libyan High Command, and they broadcast information in code that was then broken
[01:13:59.887 --> 01:14:00.267]  We're good.
[01:14:22.602 --> 01:14:26.504]  He killed Gaddafi's daughter, I think, one of his children or something.
[01:14:26.524 --> 01:14:27.505]  So that is a frame-up.
[01:14:28.265 --> 01:14:28.486]  Yes.
[01:14:28.846 --> 01:14:31.367]  And so when you were in the Massad, you had knowledge of that?
[01:14:31.547 --> 01:14:31.788]  Yes.
[01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:32.408]  Yes.
[01:14:33.148 --> 01:14:35.630]  This is the information that I'm talking about.
[01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:38.432]  Israel cannot be happy that you're talking about that.
[01:14:38.452 --> 01:14:39.072]  They never were.
[01:14:39.112 --> 01:14:41.213]  Well, Israel's not happy about anything I say.
[01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:46.797]  The point is, I don't wave flags.
[01:14:47.377 --> 01:14:49.839]  When I talk about these things, I talk about either what I know
[01:14:50.679 --> 01:14:51.139]  No, I understand.
[01:14:51.159 --> 01:14:52.840]  It sounds like you're saying you're a political atheist.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.141]  What are some other interests?
[01:14:54.181 --> 01:14:57.502]  I mean, what made you get upset with the Mossad and critical?
[01:14:57.522 --> 01:14:58.942]  I mean, what are some of the other misdeeds?
[01:14:59.222 --> 01:15:02.944]  Well, what got me... I'm not a political atheist.
[01:15:03.104 --> 01:15:05.565]  I have a left leaning, and I admit that.
[01:15:05.705 --> 01:15:08.026]  And I think the Palestinians should have a state.
[01:15:08.226 --> 01:15:13.530]  Well, by political, I mean atheist, I mean you just try to analyze the facts, you see.
[01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:14.470]  Yes, I do.
[01:15:16.592 --> 01:15:26.899]  My main concern with the Mossad, my main problem with the Mossad was the fact that the Mossad is a very important entity in the protection of the State of Israel.
[01:15:27.539 --> 01:15:31.722]  And what it should do is gather information, analyze it to the best of its ability,
[01:15:32.262 --> 01:15:44.070]  Put it into the process of, you know, into the rest of the information gathering system and provide the leaders of the state the ability to make a decision which is based on reality and data.
[01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:59.780]  The Mossad had a tendency to feel that, you know, politicians come and go, we can't rely on them to make the proper decisions, so therefore we will tailor the information in a way that will cause and about the results that we call for.
[01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:02.887]  You can't trust the Arabs.
[01:16:02.907 --> 01:16:04.228]  There's never going to be peace.
[01:16:04.288 --> 01:16:05.770]  The Palestinians have no intention.
[01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:07.531]  And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:16:07.551 --> 01:16:09.753]  All intelligence agencies have been caught doing that.
[01:16:10.154 --> 01:16:10.714]  Absolutely.
[01:16:10.754 --> 01:16:14.037]  But, you know, not being a member of others, I can't complain about them.
[01:16:15.158 --> 01:16:17.661]  And I don't feel a responsibility that I need to.
[01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:19.703]  What type of missions did you mainly run?
[01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:23.044]  Mainly recruiting of agents.
[01:16:23.665 --> 01:16:39.271]  The difference between a case officer and an agent, where a lot of people mix it up, a case officer is a person who works in the field and makes contact with people of the enemy, turns them, and then sends them back into their own countries to gather information for you.
[01:16:40.192 --> 01:16:44.113]  That's what a case officer does, and that was my job.
[01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:45.414]  So you were like a spy master?
[01:16:45.974 --> 01:16:46.675]  Absolutely, yes.
[01:16:47.096 --> 01:16:49.640]  Well, yeah, no way.
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.302]  It's more kind of a handler.
[01:16:51.983 --> 01:17:00.055]  And I was more on the side of the actual... And that's a point you made in the Washington Post that guaranteed Israeli intelligence is all over Turkey.
[01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:02.298]  They had people on probably all those ships.
[01:17:02.438 --> 01:17:03.499]  There's no question about that.
[01:17:03.599 --> 01:17:11.668]  In fact, the question that arises today about this, you know, this screw-up is, which intelligence was wrong here?
[01:17:12.049 --> 01:17:17.154]  If the Mossad did not provide the intelligence to the naval intelligence, then it's Mossad's fault.
[01:17:17.435 --> 01:17:17.915]  Well, stay there.
[01:17:17.935 --> 01:17:21.099]  Let's talk about that when we come back, and we'll take some phone calls with our guest.

[01:18:22.802 --> 01:18:27.664]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:18:27.764 --> 01:18:28.544]  What have we got?
[01:18:28.764 --> 01:18:30.885]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:18:31.205 --> 01:18:31.945]  A republic.
[01:18:32.205 --> 01:18:34.786]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:18:34.866 --> 01:18:36.766]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:18:37.126 --> 01:18:39.027]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.427]  So they think they own our land?
[01:18:40.828 --> 01:18:41.948]  They think they own our water?
[01:18:42.148 --> 01:18:42.548]  Children?
[01:18:42.748 --> 01:18:43.548]  Our education?
[01:18:43.869 --> 01:18:44.509]  Our money?
[01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:48.350]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:53.393]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:18:53.693 --> 01:18:54.514]  We have the facts.
[01:18:54.714 --> 01:18:55.835]  We have the Constitution.
[01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:56.756]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:18:56.796 --> 01:18:57.617]  We have common law.
[01:18:57.677 --> 01:18:59.939]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:19:26.235 --> 01:19:28.076]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:19:28.516 --> 01:19:28.936]  Don't!
[01:19:29.396 --> 01:19:32.417]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:20:13.928 --> 01:20:13.968]  800-822-1291.
[01:20:41.171 --> 01:20:43.401]  Yeah.
[01:20:45.922 --> 01:20:47.003]  This happens sometimes.
[01:20:47.063 --> 01:20:50.885]  I'm doing so much during the breaks that I forget the question I asked before the break.
[01:20:50.905 --> 01:20:56.228]  Maybe when we take a few calls, they can give us what that question was.
[01:20:57.168 --> 01:20:59.750]  But Victor Ostrowski is our guest.
[01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:02.391]  TheBookPatch.com is one of his websites.
[01:21:03.152 --> 01:21:05.813]  And we're here discussing the situation the world's in.
[01:21:06.814 --> 01:21:10.376]  Separately, you've got the whole North Korean peninsula with the U.S.
[01:21:10.416 --> 01:21:11.977]  aircraft carrier about to arrive.
[01:21:12.617 --> 01:21:19.421]  And I find it very curious that there's all these tensions rising globally as there's a world economic meltdown happening.
[01:21:19.721 --> 01:21:25.744]  And I go back to World War I and World War II, we always have wars when the planet is in a crisis.
[01:21:26.665 --> 01:21:34.549]  And I don't know if it's human instinct or if it's being orchestrated or what's happening, but looks like rough times are ahead.
[01:21:34.909 --> 01:21:37.851]  Victor, what's your take on the whole geopolitical landscape?
[01:21:39.409 --> 01:21:42.591]  When you have problems economically, governments tend to go to war.
[01:21:42.791 --> 01:21:49.776]  I mean, it drowns out their failures and puts the focus on something more dangerous.
[01:21:50.457 --> 01:21:58.903]  It's like they said, the biggest solution to all economic problems would be aliens if they arrived, because then we would unite.
[01:22:01.576 --> 01:22:09.643]  Things can be solved in simple terms, but politicians have a problem that they have, you know, short-term elections.
[01:22:09.683 --> 01:22:10.844]  They have to get re-elected again.
[01:22:10.864 --> 01:22:12.546]  Well, you brought that up during a break.
[01:22:12.726 --> 01:22:14.808]  There's a lot of scandals in Israel right now.
[01:22:15.549 --> 01:22:25.197]  Maybe Netanyahu knew this would blow up, but it would have a way of unifying Israelis and is a good smokescreen.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:32.782]  I think he's got a big problem with trying to solve the situation in the Middle East.
[01:22:32.822 --> 01:22:46.145]  I mean, when you have one of the chief heads of the American military go in front of Congress and say that every time an Israeli soldier shoots a Palestinian kid, you know, five
[01:22:46.926 --> 01:22:50.428]  More people joined Al-Qaeda and shooted American soldiers in Afghanistan.
[01:22:51.289 --> 01:22:56.071]  And he tied the things together, which are to be tied.
[01:22:56.452 --> 01:22:58.113]  I mean, one does relate to the other.
[01:22:58.193 --> 01:23:02.035]  I mean, we're all, so to speak, fighting the same war against terror.
[01:23:02.495 --> 01:23:08.519]  And as we're fighting it, we're creating situations that allow people to be recruited into that.
[01:23:09.179 --> 01:23:20.165]  Into that world so and we have to remember things from history I mean people are saying oh, you know we have people that are Americans that have joined Al Qaeda I know they're all so surprised, but don't forget.
[01:23:20.445 --> 01:23:33.533]  You know you had British Heads of the intelligence who turned sides and joined the Soviets so you know you also had British British commandos who helped set up the State of Israel as well
[01:23:34.352 --> 01:23:34.932]  That's correct.
[01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:37.353]  And so did American soldiers that were there.
[01:23:37.533 --> 01:23:51.980]  But expanding on that, if you have a thousand Predator drones killing people indiscriminately, don't even have to know what their name is, because they have a gun in Afghanistan or Pakistan, that is going to create real terrorism.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.440]  Well, the thing is this.
[01:23:53.901 --> 01:23:54.621]  Here's the thing.
[01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:58.603]  We have created these monsters, so to speak, that we can't talk to them.
[01:23:59.503 --> 01:24:01.524]  And if you can't talk to them, then you have to kill them.
[01:24:02.225 --> 01:24:05.710]  Uh, and they're saying, well, if you have to kill me, I'm going to fight back.
[01:24:06.311 --> 01:24:12.459]  On the other hand, if you create a dialogue and you open a window and you say, wait a minute, wait a minute, you know, uh, let's not
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.560]  Let's do it that way.
[01:24:14.721 --> 01:24:20.844]  But the military-industrial complex wants war, wants a pretext, wants weapons sales, so it's only going to get worse.
[01:24:21.004 --> 01:24:22.705]  Well, Eisenhower threatened against that.
[01:24:22.765 --> 01:24:23.806]  He warned us against that.
[01:24:23.846 --> 01:24:27.208]  He said at the time, beware of the military-industrial complex.
[01:24:27.268 --> 01:24:28.929]  And there is one, for example, in Israel.
[01:24:28.989 --> 01:24:29.829]  I know that for a fact.
[01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:32.471]  The Israeli military wants to try new weapons.
[01:24:32.531 --> 01:24:33.972]  They want to try new equipment.
[01:24:34.012 --> 01:24:35.913]  They want to make sure that things are happening.
[01:24:36.453 --> 01:24:42.917]  And that's why Mossad is part of that same game, saying, you know, we need to develop things so we can protect ourselves.
[01:24:44.108 --> 01:24:45.569]  All right, we're going to do just one more segment.
[01:24:45.589 --> 01:24:46.569]  We'll have to have you back soon.
[01:24:46.589 --> 01:24:50.692]  We'll go to Free Patriot David George and a few others with quick questions for our guest.
[01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:54.354]  And then we'll definitely have him up sooner than, I don't know how many years.
[01:24:54.394 --> 01:24:55.454]  It might have been eight, nine years.
[01:24:55.475 --> 01:24:56.095]  I forget.
[01:24:56.115 --> 01:24:59.757]  I just remember we've had Victor on before and he remembers it as well.
[01:25:00.197 --> 01:25:01.658]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.481]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:18.175]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:25:19.436 --> 01:25:24.200]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:31.366]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:25:33.307 --> 01:25:35.629]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:25:37.371 --> 01:25:39.332]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:25:41.798 --> 01:25:45.661]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:25:46.381 --> 01:25:49.503]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:25:50.224 --> 01:25:51.024]  Others don't.
[01:25:51.444 --> 01:25:53.346]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:25:53.606 --> 01:25:55.107]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:25:55.387 --> 01:25:57.948]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:25:58.269 --> 01:26:04.533]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:07.094]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.636]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:10.837]  Others don't.
[01:26:15.521 --> 01:26:17.423]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:17.903 --> 01:26:20.886]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:26:26.072 --> 01:26:28.174]  Alright, final segment with Viktor Ostrovsky.
[01:26:28.694 --> 01:26:34.220]  We will continue with your phone calls into the final hour that we just kicked off.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:35.982]  And I got a bunch of news.
[01:26:37.219 --> 01:26:43.703]  On the BP oil spill, on the economy, on what's happening in China, North Korea, it's all coming up.
[01:26:44.403 --> 01:26:52.708]  But former Mossad case officer, and he's also a Navy commander, so uniquely qualified to speak about the flotilla fiasco.
[01:26:53.409 --> 01:26:55.530]  Victor Ostrowski is our guest for about another five minutes.
[01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:58.552]  Free patriot in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:26:59.893 --> 01:27:01.574]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:27:01.594 --> 01:27:02.494]  How are you guys doing today?
[01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:03.375]  We're doing good, go ahead.
[01:27:04.615 --> 01:27:05.416]  I have a question.
[01:27:05.436 --> 01:27:08.277]  This is mainly towards Victor.
[01:27:08.697 --> 01:27:18.122]  If Israel was attacked by other nations and threatened its existence, is it still possible for Israel to initiate the Samson Option?
[01:27:19.417 --> 01:27:24.662]  Well, Israel has a nuclear capability, and I don't think they consider that.
[01:27:24.942 --> 01:27:31.328]  The Sassan option is kind of like a generality that is used, which is, you know, we'll take them with us and we'll go.
[01:27:31.768 --> 01:27:35.232]  Israel has the capability of smaller nuclear weapons.
[01:27:35.752 --> 01:27:36.132]  I think so.
[01:27:56.207 --> 01:28:01.892]  Well, yeah, I mean, Iran's trying to have it enriched in Brazil, and then our own government's trying to block that.
[01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:04.654]  I mean, that fixes it right there.
[01:28:04.934 --> 01:28:06.395]  And Turkey, by the way.
[01:28:06.635 --> 01:28:08.577]  Turkey and Brazil both offered to do that.
[01:28:09.758 --> 01:28:14.141]  It's a strange thing, but yeah, they have the option.
[01:28:14.261 --> 01:28:23.148]  They have the military capability and the nuclear capability to do that, but I don't think it should be called the Samson option anymore because it's not a self-destructive element.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:25.580]  Okay, thank you.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.361]  You're welcome.
[01:28:26.741 --> 01:28:28.622]  Alright, let's talk to David in Florida.
[01:28:28.642 --> 01:28:29.782]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:28:29.823 --> 01:28:30.543]  Go ahead, David.
[01:28:30.563 --> 01:28:34.605]  Yeah, Alex, I have a question for Victor.
[01:28:34.925 --> 01:28:45.931]  You had a guest on the other day, Mr. Hart, and he was talking about the Mossad might be involved with the 9-11, and that was his theory.
[01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:48.031]  I was wondering what Victor thought of that.
[01:28:48.051 --> 01:28:55.998]  Yeah, the former BBC reporter, I had him on because he talked to engineers who said it was explosives and we know the buildings were blown up.
[01:28:56.038 --> 01:28:57.079]  That's a separate issue.
[01:28:57.499 --> 01:29:08.148]  And then he was saying his theory is that Al-Qaeda was going to do the attack and that Mossad knew about it because it did come out in our news that Mossad was shadowing them.
[01:29:09.129 --> 01:29:10.830]  What's your take on that, Victor?
[01:29:11.331 --> 01:29:12.712]  It's absolutely
[01:29:13.527 --> 01:29:16.670]  Ridiculous.
[01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:24.639]  Israel as a whole, Mossad in particular, would never get involved in anything like that.
[01:29:25.299 --> 01:29:25.860]  The U.S.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.581]  is an ally.
[01:29:26.901 --> 01:29:27.922]  We disagree on things.
[01:29:28.002 --> 01:29:29.103]  Israel disagrees with them.
[01:29:29.824 --> 01:29:33.228]  But never, ever, ever would Israel do that.
[01:29:37.156 --> 01:29:50.459]  And again, like I said, I'm not the one defending Israel or whatever, but I can tell you that categorically, that knowing the people in the Mossad, knowing a lot of friends of mine who are still working there, that would not be done.
[01:29:50.819 --> 01:29:51.039]  Ever.
[01:29:51.499 --> 01:29:53.460]  This is... Well, here's my issue.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.401]  Government staged terror, and Israel wanted us to go into the Middle East, but
[01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:00.635]  Dick Cheney was in control of the stand-down.
[01:30:01.355 --> 01:30:11.342]  The Pentagon, NORAD, CIA drills that day, and so I see these intelligence agencies all joined at the hip.
[01:30:11.462 --> 01:30:14.064]  I know that governments are capable of anything.
[01:30:14.424 --> 01:30:25.992]  My whole issue is, and of course I expose the entire 9-11 situation, that people who think Israel did the thing all by themselves... No, I don't think Israel was involved at all.
[01:30:26.172 --> 01:30:26.512]  Period.
[01:30:27.432 --> 01:30:33.274]  What I'm saying is Israel couldn't run the attack, even if you believe that it is an inside job, which I do, Victor.
[01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:34.135]  I have the evidence.
[01:30:34.675 --> 01:30:37.676]  I'm saying Israel couldn't run the entire attack.
[01:30:37.876 --> 01:30:41.278]  Well, Israel could not have been even involved.
[01:30:41.518 --> 01:30:44.879]  And that would be, you know what, Israel is an open society.
[01:30:45.459 --> 01:30:46.040]  On that level.
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:47.441]  And they would have come out.
[01:30:47.881 --> 01:30:50.683]  And there is just no, there is no basis for that.
[01:30:51.284 --> 01:30:54.366]  And I can tell you that Israel would never, ever do that.
[01:30:54.386 --> 01:30:54.926]  Never get involved in that.
[01:30:54.946 --> 01:30:58.089]  But certainly you've heard all the accusations about Israel being involved.
[01:30:59.210 --> 01:31:02.732]  I've heard so many things, you know, about the kitchen sink on them.
[01:31:03.113 --> 01:31:07.396]  And I'm the first one to point out what they are involved in and what they're not from my personal knowledge.
[01:31:07.416 --> 01:31:13.380]  I can tell you that one thing I can guarantee with my life, and I would stake my life on that, and Israel had nothing to do with 9-11.
[01:31:14.855 --> 01:31:15.476]  Well, you know what, sir?
[01:31:15.516 --> 01:31:16.136]  We've got a break.
[01:31:16.156 --> 01:31:21.662]  Do a few more minutes with us under the sack, because I'm going to finish up on this discussion with our guest, Victor Ostrowski.
[01:31:21.682 --> 01:31:22.043]  Stay with us.
[01:31:26.454 --> 01:31:27.395]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:31.277]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:31.577 --> 01:31:33.859]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:34.059 --> 01:31:39.342]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:39.762 --> 01:31:45.986]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:46.406 --> 01:31:51.950]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:52.371 --> 01:31:56.093]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:56.574 --> 01:32:00.577]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:00.857 --> 01:32:06.381]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:06.801 --> 01:32:09.783]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:10.364 --> 01:32:11.785]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:12.345 --> 01:32:12.786]  It's here.

[01:32:22.753 --> 01:32:25.375]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:25.775 --> 01:32:30.758]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:31.099 --> 01:32:32.840]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:37.983]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:38.144 --> 01:32:39.124]  How much do you want?
[01:32:39.344 --> 01:32:40.065]  When do you want it?
[01:32:40.445 --> 01:32:42.046]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:42.326 --> 01:32:43.147]  When will you need it?
[01:32:43.407 --> 01:32:45.468]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:45.608 --> 01:32:46.709]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:46.929 --> 01:32:48.270]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:53.534]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:56.876]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:57.316 --> 01:33:00.818]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:33:01.138 --> 01:33:02.118]  How much will you need?
[01:33:02.358 --> 01:33:02.998]  We don't know.
[01:33:03.279 --> 01:33:04.179]  How much do you want?
[01:33:04.379 --> 01:33:05.099]  All you can get.
[01:33:05.299 --> 01:33:06.160]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:34:23.906 --> 01:34:26.187]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:34:26.667 --> 01:34:29.468]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:34:33.018 --> 01:34:35.319]  Victor Ostrowski is our guest.
[01:34:35.339 --> 01:34:40.002]  The website is thebookpatch.com or Ostrowskifineart.com.
[01:34:41.322 --> 01:34:47.446]  A former naval commander and then a Mossad commander case officer, handler, spy master, whatever you want to call it.
[01:34:48.587 --> 01:34:53.209]  And I was talking to him during the break and I said, look, I think Israel does corrupt, bad things.
[01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:54.670]  They've been caught doing false flags.
[01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:55.770]  You know, you've talked about it.
[01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:58.931]  And I said, I don't think Israel could carry out 9-11.
[01:34:58.991 --> 01:35:01.292]  And he said, well, Israel didn't do it.
[01:35:01.352 --> 01:35:02.093]  I can tell you that.
[01:35:02.153 --> 01:35:03.633]  But they sure could carry it out.
[01:35:03.973 --> 01:35:05.734]  So, whoa, he's got my attention there.
[01:35:06.394 --> 01:35:09.876]  I want to hear what he has to say on that subject.
[01:35:10.456 --> 01:35:12.737]  And I'm glad that the caller brought up that point.
[01:35:13.077 --> 01:35:15.178]  So, Victor, please enlighten me.
[01:35:15.638 --> 01:35:16.579]  Well, anybody could do it.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.501]  It was a very simple operation.
[01:35:18.961 --> 01:35:19.842]  The point was this.
[01:35:20.243 --> 01:35:29.652]  The operation that the Al-Qaeda carried out in taking out the buildings in 9-11 and doing this whole attack was based on a simple, basic thing.
[01:35:30.072 --> 01:35:32.655]  And the basic thing was that you were defenseless.
[01:35:33.075 --> 01:35:33.876]  You stood there.
[01:35:34.216 --> 01:35:35.877]  You had no expectations of it.
[01:35:36.237 --> 01:35:39.079]  You didn't have any system to protect you against it.
[01:35:39.419 --> 01:35:42.841]  You did not take any measures to stop anything like that.
[01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:44.782]  You were not even thinking in that direction.
[01:35:45.142 --> 01:35:51.486]  You had a whole system that was built and designed to fight the Soviet Union and to fight other, you know, countries.
[01:35:52.026 --> 01:35:56.630]  And here comes a small organization, relatively small, that had trained in the U.S.
[01:35:56.690 --> 01:35:59.072]  to fly planes, gets onto an airplane.
[01:35:59.092 --> 01:36:01.935]  You did not have a locked door between the front and the back.
[01:36:02.475 --> 01:36:09.221]  You know, you go onto any allowed plane and this will... No, no, I understand, Victor, but what I'm saying is, I mean, you're looking at this from the way it's projected at us.
[01:36:09.641 --> 01:36:12.264]  I'm looking at what, you know, the evidence shows happened on 9-11.
[01:36:12.324 --> 01:36:19.430]  I mean, the point is, does Israel have... I mean, you know, technically, then, you're saying a group of Israelis could have gone on, taken over,
[01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:23.913]  A group of, you know what, let's put it this way, a group of courts could have done it.
[01:36:23.933 --> 01:36:26.975]  No, I know, but I mean, Israel doesn't have suicide operators.
[01:36:27.355 --> 01:36:28.355]  Look, you know what?
[01:36:29.036 --> 01:36:37.701]  First of all, every country at its own time had somebody who, you know, I mean, the first suicide bomber was, you know, was Israeli in a way.
[01:36:37.801 --> 01:36:40.503]  I mean, Samson said, may I die with a Philistine.
[01:36:40.563 --> 01:36:42.304]  So, you know, it started somewhere.
[01:36:43.025 --> 01:36:47.788]  But the point of it is that to carry out such an operation,
[01:36:48.528 --> 01:36:49.709]  You don't need much.
[01:36:50.590 --> 01:37:06.624]  And to say that you have to have a whole system in place, when you're talking about, you know, NORAD or whatever, you're talking about some civilian airplanes that are flying in the air out of their lock when nobody at the time was thinking about that being done and that an airplane could actually be used.
[01:37:06.684 --> 01:37:08.326]  Okay, let's go over this briefly.
[01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:14.871]  I mean, let me tell you then, and I can send you all this if you want it, because I don't expect everybody to be aware of everything going on.
[01:37:15.732 --> 01:37:43.531]  It is confirmed, Colonel Stephen Butler at the Defense Language School, Monterey, California, AP, San Jose Mercury News, and I talked to him on the phone, it is confirmed in Newsweek, everywhere, that these guys, I've interviewed Springman, the head of the Visa Division, they were ordered to let them in, they were told their terror list is only their cover, they work for us, the CIA was running a drill that day.
[01:37:43.611 --> 01:37:45.472]  They didn't have a terror list at the time.
[01:37:47.013 --> 01:37:48.434]  Oh yeah, the CIA did.
[01:37:48.494 --> 01:37:50.695]  The CIA did with the State Department.
[01:37:50.755 --> 01:37:52.496]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:37:52.656 --> 01:37:53.637]  I'll make a deal with you.
[01:37:53.937 --> 01:37:56.698]  You see, I'm in total disagreement with you.
[01:37:57.199 --> 01:37:57.519]  Okay?
[01:37:57.779 --> 01:37:59.120]  And I'm allowed to do that.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:02.702]  I mean, you're the first guy who will say that I'm allowed to have a different opinion than you.
[01:38:02.722 --> 01:38:03.242]  Sure, yeah.
[01:38:03.762 --> 01:38:05.283]  I'm saying, okay, you got my email.
[01:38:05.443 --> 01:38:06.284]  Send me the stuff.
[01:38:06.484 --> 01:38:07.184]  Let me look at it.
[01:38:07.545 --> 01:38:09.626]  I'll come back and I'll tell you my opinion.
[01:38:09.946 --> 01:38:11.367]  I may tear everything you say down.
[01:38:12.677 --> 01:38:19.442]  Well, I mean, NORAD did stand down, and we do have the tapes of them saying, what's this exercise stuff on my screen?
[01:38:19.582 --> 01:38:20.443]  Absolutely!
[01:38:20.683 --> 01:38:22.004]  It makes absolute sense.
[01:38:22.404 --> 01:38:25.467]  You know, if that's the case, and if that's there, yeah.
[01:38:25.947 --> 01:38:27.528]  Why would they think differently?
[01:38:27.808 --> 01:38:28.989]  It's not been done before.
[01:38:29.029 --> 01:38:29.310]  You know what?
[01:38:29.630 --> 01:38:37.676]  I was on a radio show when my book came out, By Way of Deception, and I was arguing that, you know, some people are defending Israel's acts.
[01:38:37.936 --> 01:38:45.662]  To the extreme and I said what would happen one day if somebody walks up to you at 30,000 feet and puts a gun to your head and says show me your passport?
[01:38:46.405 --> 01:38:51.087]  Now, do you want to have a passport that has a total agreement with everything Israel does?
[01:38:51.167 --> 01:38:53.848]  Or do you want to have somebody that actually stood up and said something?
[01:38:54.228 --> 01:39:00.430]  So, this was not something that was not on the minds of people in intelligence services around the world.
[01:39:01.071 --> 01:39:09.234]  Israel did not put steel doors in the airplanes because they thought it would be better for the pilots because, you know, women wanted to get to them.
[01:39:09.894 --> 01:39:11.135]  There was a reason for that.
[01:39:11.495 --> 01:39:12.516]  We all knew that.
[01:39:12.957 --> 01:39:18.881]  America decided not to take action, not to protect itself, because it was too costly.
[01:39:19.847 --> 01:39:21.348]  Because it would take too much money.
[01:39:21.368 --> 01:39:22.448]  Let me expand on that.
[01:39:22.488 --> 01:39:25.490]  I mean, they've got naked body scanners in to teach us how to submit.
[01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:26.310]  Now they do.
[01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:27.191]  Now they do.
[01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:29.072]  To teach us how to submit to tyranny.
[01:39:29.372 --> 01:39:29.852]  Look, look.
[01:39:30.252 --> 01:39:31.473]  The Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[01:39:31.493 --> 01:39:32.573]  That's now declassified.
[01:39:32.613 --> 01:39:42.118]  I've got the army training manuals for captains in black ops that have been leaked, which the government admits are real, where they teach our army captains how to stage terror attacks.
[01:39:42.639 --> 01:39:45.060]  Now, are you, I mean, you know about false flag.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.120]  You talk about Israel, Ron.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:46.821]  Absolutely.
[01:39:46.921 --> 01:39:49.002]  So what I'm telling you is, look.
[01:39:49.762 --> 01:39:56.726]  Now, to be clear what you said during the break though, I mean, have you looked at the information about 9-11 having evidence of false flag?
[01:39:57.387 --> 01:39:57.567]  No.
[01:39:58.828 --> 01:40:06.092]  Are you aware that there are police and firemen saying, get back, they're blowing up building 7 and that BBC reported building 7 had fallen 25 minutes before it fell?
[01:40:06.452 --> 01:40:06.593]  No.
[01:40:08.254 --> 01:40:10.335]  No, I'm telling you right now, no.
[01:40:11.107 --> 01:40:11.447]  I don't.
[01:40:11.728 --> 01:40:22.456]  But you see, either I've been brainwashed, or whatever you want to call it, but I don't believe that the American government, I don't believe that the Israeli government, I don't believe that, I don't believe that.
[01:40:22.696 --> 01:40:29.321]  Now, I think it's rogue networks, rogue networks within the government structures, working together.
[01:40:30.122 --> 01:40:32.023]  Look, I mean, Cheney... What would be the point?
[01:40:32.043 --> 01:40:35.906]  All right, PNAC, Project for a New American Century, September 20th, 2000, said,
[01:40:38.328 --> 01:40:44.951]  Minus a huge Pearl Harbor catalyzing event, we're not going to be able to launch our Pax Americana world government.
[01:40:45.291 --> 01:40:47.231]  We need a giant stage terror attack.
[01:40:47.271 --> 01:40:48.312]  We need a terror attack.
[01:40:49.772 --> 01:40:52.874]  You know where all this has a problem?
[01:40:53.314 --> 01:40:58.696]  Where I find a problem with the American government supposedly trying to take over everything?
[01:40:59.736 --> 01:41:02.597]  If we did, we wouldn't be in such a big debt to China.
[01:41:03.598 --> 01:41:06.819]  I mean, look at the situation we're in today.
[01:41:07.691 --> 01:41:10.592]  The situation is not of a world leader.
[01:41:10.972 --> 01:41:21.596]  The situation we're in today, you know, is a nation almost at its knees, economically, to a world that it gave open access to everything it has.
[01:41:21.936 --> 01:41:25.177]  If you think there's a problem here, I'll tell you what I think the problem here.
[01:41:25.457 --> 01:41:27.718]  I think the problem here is that we have no tariffs.
[01:41:28.098 --> 01:41:32.880]  I think that anybody can come to this country, sell whatever they want, whatever price they want,
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.882]  No, I agree, but that's globalization.
[01:41:35.902 --> 01:41:38.805]  The globalists used America to build its empire.
[01:41:39.306 --> 01:41:43.890]  Now they've set us up as the boogeyman, and they're going to basically chop us down like wheat in the autumn.
[01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:47.133]  Victor Ostrowski, I really appreciate you joining us.
[01:41:47.974 --> 01:41:50.196]  The website is thebookpatch.com.
[01:41:50.536 --> 01:41:56.802]  Two interesting, informative books, critically acclaimed, on the inside of the Mossad and the Israeli government.
[01:41:57.102 --> 01:42:03.067]  I look forward to having you back in the near future, and we appreciate your insight on the situation with the flotilla.
[01:42:03.207 --> 01:42:08.272]  And as that unfolds, you may be back with us next week for a brief interview if you can, okay?
[01:42:08.572 --> 01:42:09.393]  Anytime you want.
[01:42:10.113 --> 01:42:11.174]  It's been a pleasure.
[01:42:11.354 --> 01:42:11.755]  Thank you.
[01:42:11.775 --> 01:42:12.175]  Thanks a lot.
[01:42:12.195 --> 01:42:13.036]  Interesting having him on.
[01:42:14.878 --> 01:42:17.959]  So we've had people on that believe Israel's the source of all evil.
[01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:22.180]  We've had people on who basically love Israel and think it can't do much wrong.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.781]  We've had people on kind of in the middle of the road like Victor.
[01:42:25.661 --> 01:42:30.562]  So we're trying to give a wide view to this as I try to decipher what's going on here for myself.
[01:42:30.582 --> 01:42:33.323]  You know, like I've always said, I can't tell right away what's going on.
[01:42:35.305 --> 01:42:36.746]  But give me time, I can tell you.
[01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:41.268]  Just like day one, I said, look staged with the underwear bomber on Christmas.
[01:42:41.808 --> 01:42:46.090]  And within a month, we knew the State Department was ordered to let him on and protected him, and that was staged.
[01:42:47.791 --> 01:42:53.713]  And I'm not sure yet, but I'm getting more and more there that BP was a staged deal to pass carbon taxes.
[01:42:55.314 --> 01:43:00.816]  And now we find out that the stock was dumped by Goldman Sachs two days before at a record low.
[01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:24.517]  I know how this system works, and I think even intelligent people like Victor, they look at it in a two-dimensional way, but I'm looking at it in a, not even a three-dimensional or four-dimensional, but a fifth-dimensional, you know, all these different angles and compartments and, you know, dimensions to it, you know, to really get that full-spectrum analysis.
[01:43:26.118 --> 01:43:29.960]  That's how we're able to predict things so accurately here on the show.
[01:43:36.693 --> 01:43:37.673]  It's mind-boggling.
[01:43:37.954 --> 01:43:41.615]  Look, I'm going to go to your calls in a bunch of news, but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[01:43:41.915 --> 01:43:44.856]  He hasn't been on in a while, and gold has been way up in the last week.
[01:43:45.697 --> 01:43:47.217]  Record levels in Europe.
[01:43:47.777 --> 01:43:48.518]  Record levels here.
[01:43:48.618 --> 01:43:51.639]  Premiums on gold coin surge.
[01:43:52.519 --> 01:43:54.280]  This is out of International Business Times.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:58.762]  Despite the rising prices of gold, physical demand for the yellow metal continues to surge.
[01:43:59.983 --> 01:44:07.831]  Physical demand for gold is robust and premiums on gold coins continue to rise in key bullion markets in London, Dubai, Mumbai, New York, and Beijing.
[01:44:08.332 --> 01:44:13.317]  According to the Analysts for Gold Corp., premiums on British gold sovereigns have increased from 3% to 7%.
[01:44:15.464 --> 01:44:22.046]  In just one month on British sovereigns and British investors buy the coins as they do.
[01:44:22.887 --> 01:44:24.087]  And then it just goes on from there.
[01:44:24.367 --> 01:44:29.569]  I just want to point out, Ted keeps buying gold when it's low, selling it when it's high at the old price.
[01:44:29.609 --> 01:44:34.371]  And he's run out of almost everything at, you know, the price when gold was $70, $80 lower.
[01:44:34.651 --> 01:44:35.672]  But he's still got a little bit.
[01:44:35.992 --> 01:44:39.613]  And then he bought other coins as it was going up that are still the best deals you're going to find.
[01:44:39.633 --> 01:44:44.235]  I mean, I use the example of, I've seen one of the biggest gold companies selling francs
[01:44:45.515 --> 01:44:47.676]  Uh, European francs, fifth of an ounce, for 360.
[01:44:47.936 --> 01:44:52.438]  And Ted, last week, what was, they were 250-something.
[01:44:52.478 --> 01:44:56.599]  I mean, Ted's losing money in this market if he bought them now.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:04.002]  Uh, so there's always a premium, but you can forget the premium, you can forget, you know, even bullion prices with these deals.
[01:45:04.042 --> 01:45:11.685]  So briefly, Ted, what do you have right now for people that's available, because most coin shops are sold out, or there's giant premiums?
[01:45:12.267 --> 01:45:17.809]  Well, like you said, Alex, the best thing that I have going on right now is the Frank coin at $256.68.
[01:45:17.849 --> 01:45:27.093]  Now, if you buy that coin from us, you're going to get a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's International Forecaster, too.
[01:45:27.253 --> 01:45:31.935]  Yeah, but even if people have already got the free forecaster, which is twice a week and a great value, that isn't what matters.
[01:45:32.275 --> 01:45:36.077]  That $256 per fifth of an ounce Frank, that's a really good deal.
[01:45:36.818 --> 01:45:39.800]  It's as good as it gets across the entire globe.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:41.762]  And you're right about the British sovereigns, too.
[01:45:41.802 --> 01:45:43.304]  The premiums have shot up in them.
[01:45:43.764 --> 01:45:47.508]  The supplies are so thin that I don't even sell them right now.
[01:45:47.668 --> 01:45:54.975]  I'm not keeping stock because... 800-686-2237.
[01:45:54.995 --> 01:45:55.676]  800-686-2237.
[01:45:55.976 --> 01:45:57.177]  Folks, don't screw around.
[01:45:57.237 --> 01:45:57.718]  Call up.
[01:45:58.038 --> 01:45:59.059]  Fifth of an ounce, Franks.
[01:45:59.099 --> 01:46:00.641]  That's what I've been buying the last few years.
[01:46:01.481 --> 01:46:02.202]  Really great deal.
[01:46:02.483 --> 01:46:03.644]  But briefly, gentlemen, come back.
[01:46:03.684 --> 01:46:07.188]  Tell us about some of the other coin offers you've got that are also excellent deals.
[01:46:07.509 --> 01:46:13.436]  Folks, you're not going to find Franks any less than this, and you're probably not going to be able to find them this love.
[01:46:14.257 --> 01:46:16.780]  Plus, it's a Patriot organization.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.463]  They've got them on hand, ready to ship to you right now.
[01:46:19.803 --> 01:46:20.484]  We'll be back.
[01:46:20.524 --> 01:46:20.965]  Stay with us.
[01:46:22.952 --> 01:46:27.816]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:46:27.916 --> 01:46:28.697]  What have we got?
[01:46:28.917 --> 01:46:31.039]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.120]  A republic.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:34.943]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:46:35.023 --> 01:46:36.945]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:46:37.285 --> 01:46:39.187]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:46:39.307 --> 01:46:40.588]  So they think they own our land?
[01:46:40.988 --> 01:46:42.109]  They think they own our water?
[01:46:42.309 --> 01:46:42.710]  Children?
[01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:43.711]  Our education?
[01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:44.671]  Our money?
[01:46:44.872 --> 01:46:48.535]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:46:48.875 --> 01:46:52.538]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:46:53.859 --> 01:46:54.680]  We have the facts.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:55.981]  We have the Constitution.
[01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:56.922]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:46:56.942 --> 01:46:57.783]  We have common law.
[01:46:57.823 --> 01:47:00.084]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:00.345 --> 01:47:03.067]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[01:47:03.307 --> 01:47:04.168]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:47:04.228 --> 01:47:09.032]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:47:09.192 --> 01:47:10.533]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[01:47:10.713 --> 01:47:11.534]  Don't Tread on Me.
[01:47:11.774 --> 01:47:13.055]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:14.336 --> 01:47:22.278]  Or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:47:22.898 --> 01:47:24.018]  Are you prepared?
[01:47:24.258 --> 01:47:26.359]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[01:47:26.579 --> 01:47:27.639]  There is a difference.
[01:47:27.939 --> 01:47:33.560]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.

[01:47:38.621 --> 01:47:39.582]  What kind of gear?

[01:48:14.741 --> 01:48:15.341]  Again, that's 418-844-9111.
[01:48:22.543 --> 01:48:25.265]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:48:25.505 --> 01:48:29.448]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:48:29.648 --> 01:48:31.730]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:48:31.930 --> 01:48:36.954]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:48:37.094 --> 01:48:38.835]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:48:38.915 --> 01:48:40.216]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:48:40.436 --> 01:48:41.897]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:48:41.937 --> 01:48:45.018]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:48:45.298 --> 01:48:50.340]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:59.764]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:48:59.964 --> 01:49:00.525]  We're good to go.
[01:49:22.665 --> 01:49:25.269]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:30.637]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:49:31.017 --> 01:49:32.740]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:37.807]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:49:38.047 --> 01:49:39.008]  How much do you want?
[01:49:39.228 --> 01:49:39.969]  When do you want it?
[01:49:40.349 --> 01:49:41.950]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:49:42.231 --> 01:49:43.051]  When will you need it?
[01:49:43.312 --> 01:49:45.373]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:49:45.513 --> 01:49:46.614]  Will there be any food?
[01:49:46.855 --> 01:49:48.176]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:49:48.376 --> 01:49:53.440]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:56.743]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:49:57.223 --> 01:50:00.725]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:50:01.045 --> 01:50:02.026]  How much will you need?
[01:50:02.266 --> 01:50:02.886]  We don't know.
[01:50:03.166 --> 01:50:04.087]  How much do you want?
[01:50:04.267 --> 01:50:05.007]  All you can get.
[01:50:05.208 --> 01:50:06.048]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:06.308 --> 01:50:09.070]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:11.111]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:50:11.131 --> 01:50:12.051]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:50:26.263 --> 01:50:31.908]  By the way, I talked to Jim Tucker, the granddaddy of the Bilderberg sleuths, and there wasn't a point to get him on today.
[01:50:31.928 --> 01:50:33.509]  He said he hadn't gotten any intel yet.
[01:50:33.969 --> 01:50:40.094]  But he should have it tomorrow, if not by Sunday, from the global government meeting going on in Spain.
[01:50:40.695 --> 01:50:41.976]  So look for that tomorrow.
[01:50:42.296 --> 01:50:44.818]  I've got a key announcement coming up after the next break.
[01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:49.222]  I'm going to blitz through some news and I promise get to all the phone callers that are patiently holding 1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:49.302 --> 01:50:49.462]  But Ted,
[01:50:54.446 --> 01:51:09.234]  I've got some mainstream articles here today that explain that you've got bankrupt countries bailing out bankrupt countries, and then they bail out the other bankrupt countries, but the private bankers are issuing all this currency and credit out of nothing.
[01:51:09.334 --> 01:51:12.095]  They're getting real assets in return.
[01:51:12.795 --> 01:51:20.379]  There's a method to this madness, and you notice Greece goes down, and then Spain, and now France, and England, and Iceland, and it's just getting worse and worse.
[01:51:21.019 --> 01:51:23.541]  The jobless number's up, more factories shutting down.
[01:51:24.581 --> 01:51:27.102]  You've got the situation with Mercury.
[01:51:27.122 --> 01:51:29.583]  Not going to be able to buy Mercury anymore, folks.
[01:51:30.424 --> 01:51:31.764]  The government runs GM.
[01:51:32.885 --> 01:51:34.106]  They want us dependent.
[01:51:34.566 --> 01:51:41.249]  And there's no silver bullet to save anybody in this, except take the states back, take our government back, get a true fiscal responsibility.
[01:51:41.749 --> 01:51:45.771]  But as a stopgap measure to protect yourselves, I don't buy gold and silver as an investment.
[01:51:46.351 --> 01:51:49.892]  Though I started buying gold when it was $265 or so an ounce.
[01:51:50.572 --> 01:51:51.413]  And I still buy it when it's $1,200.
[01:51:51.733 --> 01:51:55.434]  And I don't sell it when it goes up to quote, take a profit.
[01:51:57.114 --> 01:51:59.795]  It's an emergency backup against total depression.
[01:51:59.855 --> 01:52:01.456]  Just like storable food or firearms.
[01:52:01.856 --> 01:52:03.056]  And it's not that I'm living in fear.
[01:52:03.256 --> 01:52:03.656]  Oh no!
[01:52:04.136 --> 01:52:05.417]  I'm living in control!
[01:52:06.317 --> 01:52:07.337]  Just like the old-timers.
[01:52:07.798 --> 01:52:12.420]  Just like the grasshopper doesn't store stuff during the summer, the ant does.
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:15.261]  The ant lives through the winter, the grasshopper dies.
[01:52:15.961 --> 01:52:19.843]  And a lot of people are buying gold right now as an investment.
[01:52:20.723 --> 01:52:23.764]  Look, the point is, and people only buy when it's going up.
[01:52:23.824 --> 01:52:24.285]  It's crazy.
[01:52:24.305 --> 01:52:27.266]  Well, with TED, you can get in a time machine and go back and get a better deal on it.
[01:52:28.046 --> 01:52:30.847]  Again, $256 per franc.
[01:52:30.967 --> 01:52:33.068]  I wouldn't buy just one and then get a free newsletter.
[01:52:33.248 --> 01:52:34.789]  That's a great way to stick your toe in.
[01:52:35.349 --> 01:52:40.156]  I would, you know, move substantively in it if I was you, but that's what I would do personally.
[01:52:40.396 --> 01:52:47.966]  Ted, briefly, what are some of the other coin offers you've got and other gold coins you've got on hand, silver coins, some of the other smoking deals you've got?
[01:52:48.496 --> 01:52:52.037]  Well, the Walking Liberty half at $9.75 is a great buy.
[01:52:52.117 --> 01:52:53.758]  I mean, we have Eagles, U.S.
[01:52:53.838 --> 01:52:54.158]  Eagles.
[01:52:54.598 --> 01:52:55.498]  We have Krugerrands.
[01:52:55.538 --> 01:52:56.479]  We have Maple Leafs.
[01:52:56.579 --> 01:52:58.639]  I mean, we have bags of junk silver.
[01:52:58.659 --> 01:53:02.941]  I saw an article about runs on Krugerrands the last two weeks in Deutschland.
[01:53:03.281 --> 01:53:09.643]  You know, their output right now, the Krugerrand has put out, it's at a 25-year high and they can't keep up with demand.
[01:53:10.063 --> 01:53:13.346]  The British sovereigns have been sopped up and taken right out of the marketplace.
[01:53:13.687 --> 01:53:16.049]  The Franks are falling short behind that right now.
[01:53:16.369 --> 01:53:20.413]  The Europeans, who normally don't buy gold, are buying it hands down.
[01:53:20.453 --> 01:53:25.057]  I mean, they can't get enough of it, because they're watching their nations... And we've always talked about this.
[01:53:25.498 --> 01:53:29.782]  You've got maybe 1% of the population that buys gold to physically hold it.
[01:53:30.342 --> 01:53:32.784]  It was less than half a percent just two years ago.
[01:53:33.224 --> 01:53:35.545]  It's about to be 2, 3, 4 percent in the West.
[01:53:35.605 --> 01:53:37.927]  It's already more than 50 percent in India or China.
[01:53:38.527 --> 01:53:43.550]  As the yuppies figure out that paper is dangerous, you're not going to be able to find gold, folks.
[01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:44.931]  I mean, it's already happening.
[01:53:46.312 --> 01:53:47.332]  I don't know how to say it, Ted.
[01:53:47.352 --> 01:53:50.694]  I mean, I was telling them seven years ago, at $265 to get into it, are they going to listen now?
[01:53:53.772 --> 01:53:54.812]  Well, I sure hope so.
[01:53:54.852 --> 01:54:00.755]  I mean, if they're sitting in the stock market, bond market, if they have annuities, if they're sitting with money in the bank, I mean, you name it.
[01:54:01.115 --> 01:54:07.798]  Just anything you can think of, even the real estate market, has been incredibly volatile because of all the debt associated to it.
[01:54:08.158 --> 01:54:20.383]  You just simply can't get away from the fact that the United States dollar and foreign currencies are under attack because the central banks that create this money are printing money out of thin air, and it's competing with what we have.
[01:54:20.683 --> 01:54:22.043]  It's going to drive the value down.
[01:54:22.263 --> 01:54:23.444]  That's why people want gold.
[01:54:23.504 --> 01:54:28.445]  I mean, people in India right now are buying gold jewelry like no tomorrow.
[01:54:29.065 --> 01:54:40.968]  And I just need to say, if you're sitting in the stock market, bond market, whatever it is, if you have a paper asset, you better start considering gold and silver, because it's going to be one of the few things that will hold value, including your home.
[01:54:42.048 --> 01:54:43.348]  Well, it's like Mark Twain said.
[01:54:43.388 --> 01:54:48.390]  He wasn't interested in a return on his money, but just to be able to keep something.
[01:54:50.934 --> 01:54:54.915]  Again, I'm not getting into gold and silver for an investment.
[01:54:55.235 --> 01:54:57.196]  I'm doing it as an emergency backup, but it is.
[01:54:57.556 --> 01:55:02.198]  Is there any investment, Ted, that's done as well as metals in the last seven years?
[01:55:02.458 --> 01:55:06.719]  Well, not even in the last seven years, and go all the way back to 6,000 years.
[01:55:06.739 --> 01:55:14.601]  The only time that paper investments did well was from about 1980 through about 1999, right in that time frame.
[01:55:14.701 --> 01:55:19.663]  Otherwise, gold and silver has always produced more than the paper investments do.
[01:55:20.163 --> 01:55:26.785]  And of course, that 20 years of artificial boom is now designed to sink us as we plunge into world government.
[01:55:27.285 --> 01:55:28.906]  What are your silver half dollars at?
[01:55:28.926 --> 01:55:30.807]  I know that was one of the best deals I heard you do.
[01:55:30.827 --> 01:55:32.007]  Oh, that's a really good buy.
[01:55:32.047 --> 01:55:35.268]  The silver half dollars right now are at $9.75 apiece.
[01:55:35.468 --> 01:55:36.568]  You just can't beat it.
[01:55:36.628 --> 01:55:38.229]  It's a great way to get into silver.
[01:55:38.609 --> 01:55:41.390]  It's private, portable, plus also exempt from that
[01:55:42.291 --> 01:55:46.536]  60-45 revenue ruling, which was introduced in 1983, passed in 1983.
[01:55:46.596 --> 01:55:58.952]  Well, well, I mean, I mean, I mean, to be clear, tell them Alex Jones sent you, or the prices will be a little higher, they're still great deals, but to get these specials, it's the radio special with Alex Jones, so you make sure, say, no, that's the deal I want.
[01:55:59.472 --> 01:55:59.993]  Okay, 800-686-2237.
[01:56:00.013 --> 01:56:00.333]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:08.800]  You can ask them about some of the other specials they've got as well.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:08.980]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:10.361 --> 01:56:12.483]  We'll be back with the news.
[01:56:13.043 --> 01:56:13.964]  We're on the march.
[01:56:14.444 --> 01:56:16.026]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:16.967 --> 01:56:19.649]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:22.316 --> 01:56:24.619]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:56:24.699 --> 01:56:26.922]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:56:27.022 --> 01:56:29.766]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:56:30.226 --> 01:56:34.992]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:56:35.333 --> 01:56:39.538]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:56:39.838 --> 01:56:42.182]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:56:42.302 --> 01:56:44.705]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:56:45.066 --> 01:56:47.630]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:55.602]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:56:55.925 --> 01:57:01.210]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:03.592]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:57:03.632 --> 01:57:07.595]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:57:07.855 --> 01:57:08.776]  And I got news for you.
[01:57:08.916 --> 01:57:10.237]  You're everyone else.
[01:57:10.257 --> 01:57:11.278]  Invisible Empire.

[01:58:15.666 --> 01:58:16.106]  Thank you!
[01:58:22.264 --> 01:58:31.149]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:34.612]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[01:58:34.852 --> 01:58:44.278]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[01:58:44.438 --> 01:58:49.681]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[01:58:49.981 --> 01:59:05.230]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns, with absolutely no apologies.

[01:59:23.183 --> 01:59:33.731]  He's mounted down, loaded up and truckin'.
[01:59:33.952 --> 01:59:36.694]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[01:59:36.734 --> 01:59:41.038]  We've got a long way to go and a short time to come.
[01:59:44.998 --> 01:59:47.722]  Oh, Smokey's got his ears on.
[01:59:48.383 --> 01:59:52.850]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a runway.
[01:59:53.992 --> 01:59:56.355]  I love the final piece of the song.
[02:00:01.345 --> 02:00:06.009]  Well, Smokey's got his ears on and he's hot on your trail and he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[02:00:08.712 --> 02:00:13.035]  Okay, I've got some news I want to hit, but I also want to go to your phone calls.
[02:00:13.095 --> 02:00:19.621]  George, Sam, Tim, Charlie, Mike, on a host of issues that folks want to discuss here today in the last hour.
[02:00:22.283 --> 02:00:23.945]  But before I do that, I want to make an announcement.
[02:00:24.726 --> 02:00:27.608]  As you know, for two years, I have been working
[02:00:29.182 --> 02:00:43.963]  on a documentary about chemtrails and I have been planning to have it come out sometime in the fall or winter of this year and we are going to do that and it's more than just a chemtrail film it's a
[02:00:45.509 --> 02:00:53.034]  Documentary dealing with all the different ways, or some of the main ways, that the establishment is poisoning us.
[02:00:53.054 --> 02:00:58.057]  That the establishment is toxifying our food, our water, our medicines, our air.
[02:00:58.938 --> 02:01:10.005]  And the reason I'm now making the Chemtrail film is in the last two years, government's gone from denying that they're doing these aerosol spray campaigns to admitting it, but putting a spin on it.
[02:01:11.246 --> 02:01:13.027]  And we have lots of footage of Chemtrails.
[02:01:15.728 --> 02:01:22.953]  But, we're going to be done with this in about two months, and it takes a month or so to get it packaged, ready, you know, mastered, completed.
[02:01:23.473 --> 02:01:25.735]  So it should be out in, you know, October or so.
[02:01:27.836 --> 02:01:32.319]  But, making the film, I do want to get some more of the activist in it.
[02:01:33.815 --> 02:01:50.070]  uh... you know with you out there shooting the chemtrails and and you know maybe while you're shooting the chemtrail giving us some of your commentary uh... so that we can show the activist out there uh... that are exposing this or if you get a tour of your fluoride facility
[02:01:50.851 --> 02:01:56.937]  And then if you send us the footage with a letter, you know, giving us authorization to use it however we want the film and your number, we can call you about it if you want.
[02:01:57.878 --> 02:02:00.140]  I'm not guaranteeing if you send it to us we'll end up using it.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:10.249]  Whoever shoots video of chemtrails or gets a tour of your water treatment plant and the sodium fluoride, you know, you should upload whatever you do to YouTube as well because, you know, the main goal of this is educating people.
[02:02:11.784 --> 02:02:16.910]  Uh, but, uh, we do want to get more footage of chemtrails versus real contrails.
[02:02:16.930 --> 02:02:17.711]  You can send us both.
[02:02:18.171 --> 02:02:22.997]  And we want to capture, you know, the different diversity of not just people in the U.S.
[02:02:23.057 --> 02:02:24.979]  or Canada, but in England or in Europe.
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.621]  So let me give you the P.O.
[02:02:26.641 --> 02:02:26.901]  box.
[02:02:26.941 --> 02:02:28.583]  We've got about a month deadline on this.
[02:02:28.603 --> 02:02:29.704]  If we're going to be able to use this,
[02:02:31.067 --> 02:02:34.169]  A month, maybe a month and a half, because I have limited staff.
[02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:38.271]  We've got to get your video and watch it, and then make sure you've given us authorization to use it.
[02:02:38.791 --> 02:02:47.315]  Basically just send a letter saying, you know, I give you full authorization in the known universe through this limited license to use this however you see fit, but I retain, you know, the right to use it however I want.
[02:02:47.736 --> 02:02:49.196]  And your name, Billy Bob, in the footage.
[02:02:50.757 --> 02:02:51.577]  Then we can use it.
[02:02:52.058 --> 02:03:01.002]  But more than just chemtrails, because we've got a lot of that, but I also want to be able to show it in different parts of the country and show a map and say this person shot this here, this person shot that there.
[02:03:01.242 --> 02:03:05.104]  If you don't want your name used, put that in the letter, just authorize us to use it.
[02:03:06.124 --> 02:03:10.026]  And again, I'm not saying I can use everything I've sent, but if you've got chemtrail footage you shot,
[02:03:10.826 --> 02:03:15.809]  Set up a camera and talk about the footage you're sending us, along with the footage.
[02:03:17.070 --> 02:03:21.553]  Don't send us your originals, because we get so busy, you know, we can't guarantee I'll have the right address.
[02:03:21.753 --> 02:03:25.336]  Send it back, send us a copy, or if you don't want it, you can send us the original.
[02:03:25.896 --> 02:03:26.857]  But let me give you the P.O.
[02:03:26.877 --> 02:03:27.157]  Box.
[02:03:27.217 --> 02:03:28.578]  It's P.O.
[02:03:28.698 --> 02:03:31.459]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:36.203]  And this film, two years in the making, more than five years of research,
[02:03:36.983 --> 02:03:38.985]  We got Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons.
[02:03:39.045 --> 02:03:40.947]  I never did anything with that footage I shot five years ago.
[02:03:41.267 --> 02:03:46.212]  When it got declassified, how the government could create hurricanes, steer hurricanes, use hurricanes.
[02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:49.735]  The point is, this film covers every angle.
[02:03:50.396 --> 02:03:50.736]  Okay?
[02:03:50.896 --> 02:03:52.077]  And, I mean, the film...
[02:03:53.178 --> 02:03:54.599]  It's well more than half done.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:57.842]  And it's kind of been sitting there on the shelf while I got more material.
[02:03:57.882 --> 02:04:04.288]  And I finally just said, look, I have this problem with obsessing on something and just getting more, more, more, more, more.
[02:04:04.308 --> 02:04:07.891]  Kind of like my JFK film, Five Years in the Making.
[02:04:10.333 --> 02:04:11.734]  I'm going to try to just pound it out.
[02:04:11.774 --> 02:04:16.738]  It's just that I've just got so much.
[02:04:18.303 --> 02:04:19.785]  So this is more than a chemtrail film.
[02:04:19.805 --> 02:04:25.371]  This is a eugenics documentary about so many issues, vaccines, you name it.
[02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:26.812]  And we're covering everything.
[02:04:27.172 --> 02:04:29.555]  This will be the definitive chemtrail film.
[02:04:30.135 --> 02:04:36.042]  But I do want to have... We've already got people from California and Texas and a few other states, but I...
[02:04:39.186 --> 02:04:40.728]  There it is on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:40.748 --> 02:04:43.350]  They've zoomed in on the wall to where I have the P.O.
[02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:45.311]  Box up there for when I forget the address.
[02:04:45.751 --> 02:04:46.912]  It's Info Wars, P.O.
[02:04:46.952 --> 02:04:50.415]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:04:51.376 --> 02:04:53.437]  Please mail it to us as quickly as you can.
[02:04:54.078 --> 02:05:02.624]  Carry a camera around with you, put it on a tripod, get us good footage of the chemtrails, handheld, whatever, and just get it to us, but also make some comments.
[02:05:04.126 --> 02:05:10.650]  And that may end up in the film because I want to show not just Alex Jones talking or the 20 plus people we've interviewed for this.
[02:05:11.771 --> 02:05:13.052]  I want to show you the people.
[02:05:13.612 --> 02:05:14.713]  We the people out there.
[02:05:15.053 --> 02:05:16.334]  And I want footage from Germany.
[02:05:16.734 --> 02:05:17.815]  I want footage from Russia.
[02:05:17.835 --> 02:05:18.936]  I want footage from Japan.
[02:05:19.256 --> 02:05:23.479]  I want footage from Brazil, from Mexico, from England, from Ireland, from Scotland.
[02:05:23.959 --> 02:05:25.500]  I need your help, InfoWarriors.
[02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:26.381]  So P.O.
[02:05:26.421 --> 02:05:26.681]  Box 19549.
[02:05:29.378 --> 02:05:30.699]  Austin, Texas, 78760.
[02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:39.006]  And Dave over at the Alex Jones Channel will also snippet out this little rant and post that for people on the web.
[02:05:39.026 --> 02:05:42.508]  We're going to post this video on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:05:42.909 --> 02:05:44.590]  I mean, it's an amazing documentary.
[02:05:46.371 --> 02:05:47.853]  And we got incredible chemtrails.
[02:05:49.174 --> 02:05:57.916]  But I just, I really want to show you the activists and have a little of that flavor in there and that's the final thing I need to finish this film.
[02:05:57.956 --> 02:06:02.378]  So I want to thank you in advance for all your support and all the people that have mailed us chemtrail footage.
[02:06:02.398 --> 02:06:10.600]  You know, we didn't mail a lot of great chemtrail footage when I called for this a year ago and two years ago, respectively, but really no one sent me footage of them talking.
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:12.161]  Maybe you're nervous.
[02:06:12.201 --> 02:06:21.188]  Well, just aim it at a chemtrail while you talk and say, I'm here in Bakersfield, California, and they're spraying all the time.
[02:06:21.208 --> 02:06:22.049]  We're up on a hilltop.
[02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:24.050]  You know, the shots I really want are cities.
[02:06:24.891 --> 02:06:26.973]  Because I've seen this so many times without a camera.
[02:06:28.034 --> 02:06:29.375]  Like off 360, Austin.
[02:06:29.895 --> 02:06:34.559]  And you'll see a blue sky, and then they start spraying the trails, and it just turns the whole sky into a haze.
[02:06:35.379 --> 02:06:36.380]  And they're spraying them at 5,000 feet.
[02:06:39.443 --> 02:06:43.125]  And the planes go and turn around and go in crisscrosses.
[02:06:43.145 --> 02:06:43.986]  They're not landing.
[02:06:44.006 --> 02:06:44.946]  They're not waiting to land.
[02:06:45.006 --> 02:06:46.247]  I mean, rural areas.
[02:06:46.767 --> 02:06:59.855]  Also, also, send us your photos to robd, r-o-b-d, stands for robdew at InfoWars.com, or jaron.com, jaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:00.496 --> 02:07:02.217]  Send us your photos that you took.
[02:07:03.462 --> 02:07:11.305]  Bigger res, better, and with a little note where you took it so we can put on the screen, you know, where this was shot.
[02:07:11.405 --> 02:07:12.605]  Photos are great as well.
[02:07:13.205 --> 02:07:14.526]  Photos you took five years ago.
[02:07:14.906 --> 02:07:20.388]  If you shot video ten years ago, I want to be able to say this is ten years ago in Florida, in Tallahassee.
[02:07:21.068 --> 02:07:22.308]  I mean, dig through it all.
[02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:23.309]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:07:23.349 --> 02:07:23.649]  P.O.
[02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:26.410]  Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:30.371]  You know, I hate even getting into chemtrails here on air.
[02:07:31.664 --> 02:07:32.784]  Without even going over what it is.
[02:07:32.804 --> 02:07:35.785]  You know, we've got new listeners going, what in tarnations is this guy talking about?
[02:07:35.805 --> 02:07:40.207]  Well, just Google, White House calls for geoengineering planet to save us from global warming.
[02:07:40.647 --> 02:07:44.468]  Then you find out, they go, yes, we've had a secret program and we didn't want to tell you about it.
[02:07:45.608 --> 02:07:53.371]  We've had people, like we paid, you know, so they had money for the hotel and stuff, to send We Are Change to events in California.
[02:07:54.749 --> 02:08:01.675]  Over a year ago, where top globalists admitted, yeah, we've kept the program secret, but now we're telling you we are geoengineering.
[02:08:02.095 --> 02:08:03.816]  I mean, this is powerful stuff.
[02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:06.138]  Yeah, there's the Wall Street Journal.
[02:08:07.419 --> 02:08:10.501]  Team Obama will consider geoengineering to fight climate change, see?
[02:08:10.521 --> 02:08:18.247]  But then when you actually go to the conferences, they admit, oh, well, all the previous stuff was just a giant secret test on all of the continents of the planet.
[02:08:19.571 --> 02:08:29.761]  We got footage of jets flying right beside another jet with no condensation trail versus a trail, or we've got jets at 5,000 feet in the summer where you cannot get ice crystals.
[02:08:30.742 --> 02:08:43.294]  And at 30,000 feet up above them where you're supposed to get them, no ice crystals or real contrails being laid down that are dissipating in seconds versus artificial ones that are up there for hours.
[02:08:43.394 --> 02:08:44.015]  I mean, it's just
[02:08:45.501 --> 02:08:49.522]  It's unbelievable the scale of this program that is going on.
[02:08:50.522 --> 02:08:52.683]  And you know, there's facilities out in Arizona.
[02:08:52.723 --> 02:08:54.704]  Just Google Chemtrail Facility, Arizona.
[02:08:55.264 --> 02:08:56.964]  We don't have the money, the time, the energy.
[02:08:56.984 --> 02:09:03.426]  If you want to go shoot footage of that and send it to us, and we've got the photos, send it all to robd at infowars.com.
[02:09:04.726 --> 02:09:09.888]  In fact, Matt, did we create that special email just for me?
[02:09:09.908 --> 02:09:10.508]  Did we ever do that?
[02:09:12.227 --> 02:09:13.648]  Because I asked him two weeks ago to create it.
[02:09:14.089 --> 02:09:15.170]  You know, we'll create one.
[02:09:15.490 --> 02:09:17.712]  Chemtrailsandinfowars.com right now.
[02:09:18.413 --> 02:09:20.114]  Will you call the IT guys in here right now?
[02:09:21.215 --> 02:09:21.555]  Thank you.
[02:09:22.596 --> 02:09:24.398]  Because if I don't do this now, it won't happen.
[02:09:24.718 --> 02:09:26.520]  Chemtrailsandinfowars.com.
[02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:29.663]  Chemtrailsandinfowars.com.
[02:09:29.783 --> 02:09:31.805]  Matt, can I have chemtrailsandinfowars.com?
[02:09:35.174 --> 02:09:38.435]  I just wanted to quickly make a suggestion for that JFK thing because you brought it up.
[02:09:38.455 --> 02:09:39.076]  Doug Horn was on
[02:10:04.201 --> 02:10:04.602]  I think so.
[02:10:16.638 --> 02:10:33.787]  That definitively went through all the details to show that they were all either fabricated or manipulated or whatever the evidence... Well, Los Alamos Laboratories, three years ago, tested a lone bullet and found it wasn't the same bullet as the fragments and there were no fragments from the lone bullet.
[02:10:33.847 --> 02:10:34.528]  It's all fake.
[02:10:35.528 --> 02:10:42.912]  Yeah, well, that's exactly what he was getting into, but he goes into meticulous detail, excruciating detail, is what I'm saying.
[02:10:43.508 --> 02:10:47.812]  And you can't shoot his stuff down easily, so Doug Horn is somebody you should hit.
[02:10:47.832 --> 02:10:53.878]  Maybe you know Whitley or you know how to contact him through... Yeah, well somebody give me a pen.
[02:10:53.938 --> 02:10:58.582]  Somebody bring me a pen and I had like five of them and I guess I walked out of the room with them.
[02:10:58.822 --> 02:10:59.483]  Doug Horn.
[02:11:00.043 --> 02:11:07.851]  Okay, I mean was he involved in Los... because that was even in like the Dallas Morning News three years ago about the Los Alamos National Laboratories that the Army did the test.
[02:11:09.079 --> 02:11:17.646]  Yeah, he was the part of the last investigative thing to go over all the material, and even with the brain stuff, he seemed to search that down.
[02:11:17.666 --> 02:11:29.396]  He came up with new details, but he had like a $70 five-volume thing on each piece of detail, so he's probably done more definitive investigation than anybody on this.
[02:11:29.736 --> 02:11:33.539]  I'll have to get Jesse Ventura to talk to him, then, because I'm consulting on...
[02:11:34.841 --> 02:11:42.847]  I'm sure he's supposed to come to Austin in the next two weeks, interview some locals with what they're doing with the Threat Fusion Centers and with my breaking of the Mike report.
[02:11:42.887 --> 02:11:47.631]  It's one of the episodes, but I'll have to give him that Doug Horn thing on the JFK thing.
[02:11:48.311 --> 02:11:49.212]  I appreciate your call.
[02:11:49.252 --> 02:11:49.952]  Anything else, George?
[02:11:50.993 --> 02:11:52.314]  One other thing on the Build-A-Burgers.
[02:11:52.374 --> 02:11:58.679]  Why can't we do something like the South Koreans did a number of, what was it, about a year ago or something like that?
[02:11:58.699 --> 02:11:59.780]  They used something like Twitter.
[02:12:00.359 --> 02:12:06.064]  Where they basically were just fed up with their government bailing out one of their big companies.
[02:12:06.464 --> 02:12:13.590]  They had a couple thousand people and before you know it they kept twittering all over the place until they were millions of people on the floor.
[02:12:13.871 --> 02:12:23.279]  Maybe something like that should be suggested or so how they did it because whenever one of these characters whether it's a politician or Bilderbergers, if we could use what the Koreans did
[02:12:24.295 --> 02:12:29.239]  Instead of just a couple hundred people showing up, there'd be tens of thousands showing up and each day growing.
[02:12:29.539 --> 02:12:32.861]  Maybe they'd get the idea to shut this thing down before it gets out of hand.
[02:12:33.702 --> 02:12:34.543]  Well, that's a good point.
[02:12:34.583 --> 02:12:35.764]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:36.724 --> 02:12:39.766]  Look, I mean, it's up to you, the individuals, to make things like that happen.
[02:12:39.786 --> 02:12:49.313]  I know for several years they've had Twitter systems and others where the paparazzi use it to harass movie stars and TV personalities because everybody's on the Twitter in L.A.
[02:12:49.593 --> 02:12:53.056]  going, I've got, you know, Charlie Sheen, get him, he's over here eating.
[02:12:53.556 --> 02:12:55.836]  And that's kind of mean, because Charlie doesn't deserve that.
[02:12:56.557 --> 02:13:03.998]  But for the politicians and the globalists, it certainly is an effective tool to expose them and let them know we're not happy with their criminal activity.
[02:13:04.278 --> 02:13:10.580]  You know, to at least come over there and have a hundred people show up at a restaurant when they're eating and say, we don't like your New World Order, we're not your slaves.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:12.880]  Just to let them know, hey, we know who you are.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:19.581]  But as Brzezinski said, the people are now aware of the fact that we have a world government, and that's a big part of it.
[02:13:19.982 --> 02:13:21.542]  Sam in California, you're on the air.
[02:13:22.242 --> 02:13:23.262]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:13:23.302 --> 02:13:34.966]  I know I don't got much time so I'm just gonna quickly start off by saying you're a true patriot and on top of that you are a humanitarian because information is everything and we need to educate everybody we can.
[02:13:35.446 --> 02:13:40.588]  I just recently was fortunate enough to get a link from a friend to your Facebook page
[02:13:41.255 --> 02:13:46.457]  And ever since then, I've been listening to you every single day, and I've been trying to call, and I just finally got through today.
[02:13:46.617 --> 02:13:48.057]  That's a beautiful story.
[02:13:48.117 --> 02:13:50.198]  I mean, that's how we're reaching more and more people.
[02:13:50.538 --> 02:13:56.559]  Think of unlocking a mind or giving somebody, you know, a great source of a multi-spectrum information.
[02:13:56.959 --> 02:14:02.641]  Because my listeners are activists and are reaching out to people, that's why we're having an effect.
[02:14:02.961 --> 02:14:04.101]  And it's not just this show.
[02:14:04.481 --> 02:14:09.923]  It's a paradigm shift across the board if the people realize that personal contact or
[02:14:10.784 --> 02:14:19.289]  Absolutely, you're absolutely right.
[02:14:19.329 --> 02:14:32.078]  And I just wanted to quickly touch up on Israel and a few other things, because I myself am a Persian American, I'm Muslim American, and I don't want people lashing out at Jewish people because that's not right and that's not Islam at all.
[02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:38.122]  The thing is, you need to distinguish the difference between Judaism and Zionism.
[02:14:38.942 --> 02:14:54.536]  The Zionists are the ones that control the major state of Israel, and there's actually a group that I just recently found online called Jews United Against Zionism, and these are Jewish rabbis, Orthodox Jews, that do not believe in the state of Israel.
[02:14:54.556 --> 02:14:56.838]  It's a neutral party, it's a neutral party, yeah.
[02:14:57.458 --> 02:14:58.059]  Absolutely.
[02:14:58.319 --> 02:15:05.105]  And this is just one thing that needs to be touched upon, because people are really starting to move towards anti-Semitism, and that's not what is
[02:15:05.725 --> 02:15:15.548]  Well, my issue is, though, is that the brand of Zionism with blockades of Gaza and doing all those horrible things is really bad and I'm against it.
[02:15:15.928 --> 02:15:18.329]  But then there's... I think it's terms.
[02:15:18.369 --> 02:15:25.751]  When people use a term like Zionist, well, I mean, there's so many, like, Christians who want the end of the world to happen in Israel.
[02:15:26.071 --> 02:15:27.791]  They call themselves Christian Zionists.
[02:15:27.811 --> 02:15:30.192]  So I think that's where these terms confuse people.
[02:15:30.984 --> 02:15:31.824]  Great, they do.
[02:15:32.045 --> 02:15:42.650]  And, you know, these are things that we need to distinguish the difference between, because the last thing we need is misinformed people starting, you know, controversy that we don't need.
[02:15:42.670 --> 02:15:51.034]  Because we have bigger problems, like the Bilderberg Group and these elites who seek to control our world, our way of life, our way of thought.
[02:15:51.594 --> 02:15:53.015]  And that's the true terrorism.
[02:15:53.575 --> 02:15:56.677]  That's what we need to fight, is the fact that they go on the news
[02:15:57.193 --> 02:16:01.715]  And spread their propaganda to basically manifest fear in people.
[02:16:02.055 --> 02:16:12.898]  So when they come out with these outrageous plans to have carbon taxes and this and that, we can't stand for that.
[02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:13.498]  And you know what?
[02:16:13.598 --> 02:16:14.699]  Information is everything.
[02:16:15.119 --> 02:16:17.520]  You're doing the right thing and I'm going to do my part.
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:19.140]  I'm going to take footage of Chemtrails.
[02:16:19.901 --> 02:16:24.222]  I've been telling every person that I come in contact with about you and your show.
[02:16:25.012 --> 02:16:25.633]  I don't think so.
[02:16:38.891 --> 02:16:42.653]  These elite are going to try something absurd, like martial law.
[02:16:43.053 --> 02:16:44.714]  And, you know, I just can't see that happening.
[02:16:45.174 --> 02:16:52.838]  Well, I mean, it's an incremental martial law, where they put you through naked body scanners and then admit they're recording your genitals and laughing at you.
[02:16:52.878 --> 02:16:53.799]  That's martial law.
[02:16:54.159 --> 02:17:02.644]  Or when the IRS takes your house, or when cities are taking houses for $360 water bills, that's martial law.
[02:17:03.404 --> 02:17:06.806]  When the government's saying that they may take your pension funds, that's martial law.
[02:17:07.406 --> 02:17:10.910]  When police are beating up people for videotaping them, that's martial law.
[02:17:11.431 --> 02:17:13.253]  And so incrementally, we are going into this.
[02:17:13.773 --> 02:17:19.200]  I'm gonna hit a few news articles and a few more calls on the other side from Charlie, John, Sean, and others.
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:19.640]  Stay with us.
[02:17:22.884 --> 02:17:23.965]  Don't answer it!
[02:17:24.739 --> 02:17:32.825]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[02:17:32.845 --> 02:17:33.386]  800-477-9256.
[02:17:34.326 --> 02:17:40.431]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[02:17:40.691 --> 02:17:44.735]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[02:17:44.935 --> 02:17:52.202]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days guaranteed, without a payment plan, and without attorneys or going to court.

[02:18:15.242 --> 02:18:15.562]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:18:21.747 --> 02:18:24.069]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:18:24.130 --> 02:18:26.352]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:18:26.452 --> 02:18:29.254]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:18:29.675 --> 02:18:34.419]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:38.964]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:18:39.284 --> 02:18:41.607]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:18:41.627 --> 02:18:44.151]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:18:44.171 --> 02:18:47.074]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:18:47.435 --> 02:18:55.025]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:18:55.365 --> 02:19:00.626]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:19:00.746 --> 02:19:03.547]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:19:03.607 --> 02:19:07.028]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:19:07.288 --> 02:19:08.188]  And I got news for you.
[02:19:08.348 --> 02:19:09.669]  You're everyone else.
[02:19:09.709 --> 02:19:10.709]  Invisible Empire.

[02:19:21.426 --> 02:19:21.766]  Fact.
[02:19:22.007 --> 02:19:22.167]  Fact.
[02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:22.307]  Fact.
[02:19:22.347 --> 02:19:22.487]  Fact.
[02:19:22.527 --> 02:19:22.667]  Fact.
[02:19:51.206 --> 02:19:51.706]  I think so.
[02:20:26.738 --> 02:20:34.863]  Well, a couple weeks ago, prominent members of Chicago society, 80 plus years old, were being robbed at weapon point.
[02:20:34.943 --> 02:20:36.744]  So they defended themselves with firearms.
[02:20:37.385 --> 02:20:39.366]  And I said, watch, they're probably going to be indicted.
[02:20:39.566 --> 02:20:43.109]  And the Mob Boss Daily is moving to have them indicted.
[02:20:44.358 --> 02:21:05.587]  A Korean war vet in Chicago in the last few days used a firearm to shoot and kill a long time felon who was benefited from the catch and release program and he was breaking in to the home and attacking the guy's wife so he shot him and Mayor Daley is basically calling him scum.
[02:21:07.585 --> 02:21:13.667]  Just like a reporter a few weeks ago talked about the Second Amendment and how there's no right to own guns in Chicago because they have a higher crime rate.
[02:21:14.128 --> 02:21:18.930]  And Daley went crazy and said, I will shove a gun up your... and I will, you know, I'll blow you away.
[02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:21.511]  I mean, he's just like a wild animal.
[02:21:21.811 --> 02:21:22.431]  I rule you!
[02:21:22.491 --> 02:21:23.451]  I'm gonna get your guns!
[02:21:23.571 --> 02:21:24.112]  I own you!
[02:21:24.352 --> 02:21:25.172]  I'm taking it all!
[02:21:25.192 --> 02:21:28.213]  I mean, that's just who these people are.
[02:21:28.813 --> 02:21:29.834]  Bloomberg, all of them.
[02:21:32.438 --> 02:21:34.739]  New law will require a license to be a journalist.
[02:21:34.919 --> 02:21:36.779]  That's all over the news.
[02:21:36.859 --> 02:21:41.120]  Calls increase for government to regulate internet journalists and bloggers.
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:44.421]  Liberal coalition demands FCC move to shut down talk radio.
[02:21:45.261 --> 02:21:48.342]  I mean this is like, this is all over the news.
[02:21:48.362 --> 02:21:50.282]  This is mainstream news this is going on.
[02:21:51.563 --> 02:21:52.483]  Here's some good news though.
[02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:53.723]  They demonized Rand Paul.
[02:21:54.143 --> 02:21:55.643]  Said he was basically Adolf Hitler.
[02:21:55.944 --> 02:21:56.444]  What happened?
[02:21:56.804 --> 02:21:57.604]  It was all lies.
[02:21:57.804 --> 02:22:00.125]  His approval rating and his polls went up!
[02:22:01.265 --> 02:22:01.845]  Went up!
[02:22:04.755 --> 02:22:05.516]  So that's the good news.
[02:22:05.556 --> 02:22:07.458]  People are not buying the propaganda anymore.
[02:22:07.478 --> 02:22:13.023]  And that article is at GCN Live, just GCNLive.com by Paul Watson.
[02:22:13.323 --> 02:22:17.607]  Rand Paul extends lead over Conway despite racism smear.
[02:22:18.088 --> 02:22:19.149]  Get this out to everybody.
[02:22:19.409 --> 02:22:21.892]  Send it to the media and say, you're out of bullets.
[02:22:21.972 --> 02:22:23.133]  No one believes you anymore.
[02:22:23.453 --> 02:22:26.396]  When you demonize someone, people go, oh, I better vote for him.
[02:22:26.836 --> 02:22:28.798]  Charlie in New York, you're on the air.
[02:22:28.838 --> 02:22:29.199]  Go ahead.
[02:22:29.963 --> 02:22:31.204]  Pleasure to talk to you, Alex.
[02:22:31.264 --> 02:22:33.265]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[02:22:33.505 --> 02:22:33.845]  Welcome.
[02:22:33.925 --> 02:22:35.526]  Very brief, we're running out of time.
[02:22:36.586 --> 02:22:40.288]  Like yourself, I always like to get my information correct.
[02:22:40.908 --> 02:22:46.431]  I'm sorry I missed Victor when he was on, but I have a statement from a Dr. Alan Soborski.
[02:22:46.471 --> 02:22:50.013]  He's a former director of Strategic Studies Institute, U.S.
[02:22:50.093 --> 02:22:51.094]  Army War College.
[02:22:51.774 --> 02:22:55.876]  He states in a one-line statement, it is 100% certain 9-11 was a Mossad operation.
[02:22:58.479 --> 02:23:04.948]  He's an impeccable source, and I think he has access to intelligence that you and I could only dream of having.
[02:23:06.310 --> 02:23:07.091]  Who is that again?
[02:23:08.052 --> 02:23:09.915]  Dr. Alan Ceborski.
[02:23:09.935 --> 02:23:10.435]  S-A-B-R-O-S-K-Y.
[02:23:16.593 --> 02:23:26.757]  My only issue is, I had Alan Hart on earlier, former top BBC reporter, and he said, well, I think the Arabs are going to attack us and Israel knew, and basically piggybacked.
[02:23:27.437 --> 02:23:32.879]  And from my research, you know, NORAD was ordered to stand down.
[02:23:33.279 --> 02:23:39.121]  Cheney, in front of the Transportation Secretary in the bunker, said the order still stands for the stand down.
[02:23:40.342 --> 02:23:40.822]  The U.S.
[02:23:40.882 --> 02:23:43.064]  embassies were ordered to let the guys in.
[02:23:43.104 --> 02:23:44.625]  They were trained at military bases.
[02:23:44.905 --> 02:23:46.467]  They thought they were taking part in a drill.
[02:23:47.427 --> 02:23:51.771]  And I know it's all kind of cause celeb and trendy to say Israel did it.
[02:23:52.452 --> 02:23:53.112]  I understand that.
[02:23:53.152 --> 02:23:54.894]  I'm not saying Israel doesn't do false flags.
[02:23:55.314 --> 02:23:59.758]  And there were a lot of neocons involved in 9-11 that are, you know, really Israeli agents.
[02:23:59.798 --> 02:24:01.839]  But to say just Israel did it,
[02:24:05.293 --> 02:24:07.453]  I like Tarpley's detailed analysis, Charlie.
[02:24:08.134 --> 02:24:13.014]  And that explains how they have mole, rogue networks in all the major Western intelligence agencies.
[02:24:13.355 --> 02:24:17.035]  It's kind of like the Mujahideen had Pakistani, Israeli, U.S.
[02:24:17.635 --> 02:24:18.596]  and British support.
[02:24:19.116 --> 02:24:23.096]  And over and over again, they... I'm just saying there's multi-heads of the Hydra.
[02:24:23.476 --> 02:24:25.357]  People say, no, it's a one-headed dragon.
[02:24:25.797 --> 02:24:30.138]  Well, I mean, you know... My research shows multi-headed dragon.
[02:24:30.198 --> 02:24:31.258]  I mean, what do you say to that?
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:34.581]  I believe there are others that are complicit in this operation.
[02:24:34.641 --> 02:24:35.881]  It just wasn't one-sided.
[02:24:36.502 --> 02:24:39.103]  I want to touch on one other thing, and then I'm going to let others get through.
[02:24:39.583 --> 02:24:47.746]  As far as your chemtrails spraying, with the chemicals that we're all being exposed to, there's a product out there that will get rid of all of these toxins in our air.
[02:24:47.766 --> 02:24:49.427]  Well, unfortunately, we're out of time.
[02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:51.907]  So we won't have time to get others through.
[02:24:51.927 --> 02:24:54.308]  Mike, John, Sean, James, calling back to Montgomery.
[02:24:54.328 --> 02:24:55.989]  Stay ahead of the line if you tell folks you were on hold.
[02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:57.169]  Great job, crew.
[02:24:57.189 --> 02:24:58.290]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:59.810]  We have news from Bilderberg.
[02:24:59.830 --> 02:25:01.051]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
