[00:00:05.377 --> 00:00:06.678]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.678 --> 00:00:08.459]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.220]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.801]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:13.342]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:17.524]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:21.586]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:36.142]  Well, former Israeli Navy Captain and Mossad officer Viktor Ostrovsky is saying it is a horrible debacle that was carried out in a moronic fashion.
[00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:41.424]  But I guess he's anti-Israel, because you're not allowed to criticize Israel in any way.
[00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:44.486]  You know, we hear the same thing here in our government.
[00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:50.189]  If you criticize anything Barack Obama does, you're anti-America.
[00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:55.799]  If you criticize anything Obama does, you're a racist because he happens to be part African.
[00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.365]  Of course it has nothing to do with it.
[00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.855]  This situation that happened with the flotilla being boarded is a fiasco.
[00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:17.809]  Any way you slice it, I'm not anti-Israel, I don't hate Israel, but I don't buy into the way the media beats you over the head if you don't worship everything Israel does and calls you anti-Semitic.
[00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:21.572]  That tends to make people rebel and then want to criticize Israel.
[00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:33.100]  But then I also get it from the other side, who I found to be very deceptive, and to exaggerate, and to lie perpetually about Israel, and about me!
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.723]  Claiming I work for Israel, and it just, I mean, it's huge on the internet.
[00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:42.507]  It's as phony as a $3 bill, but that's just the way it is.
[00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.684]  That's just the way it is.
[00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:48.628]  And it's a cult.
[00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:51.674]  The support, the unquestioning support of Israel is a cult.
[00:01:52.699 --> 00:02:14.547]  is a tribal cult uh... and the people that hate israel i found it's a cult you know humans are similar report regardless of what religious creator you know what ethnic derivation you come from and i quite quite frankly and just sick and tired of all of it ladies and gentlemen i will cover all the developments with the flotilla uh... israel starting to uh...
[00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:26.653]  Soften their stance a little bit because their old ally Turkey had three of the six ships were under Turkish flags that were attacked.
[00:02:26.653 --> 00:02:33.660]  One of the main ships where the boarding parties were resisted, that's now not being debated, is the main bone of contention.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.187]  And the Turks are sending frigates and missile cruisers out
[00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:52.120]  to escort a Irish ship that has a Nobel laureate on board, an Irish flagship, and there are more ships coming.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.303]  So this is a PR disaster for Israel.
[00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:58.346]  Any way they slice it, they are going to lose ground.
[00:02:58.346 --> 00:03:05.372]  That'll just cause Israel to circle the wagons even more, and get more belligerent, which is exactly what the manipulators want.
[00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:22.730]  And you notice suddenly we've got crises on the Korean Peninsula, and there's crises in the Mediterranean, and there's crises in Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and Iraq, and the world markets are imploding, and Iran has announced they're dumping 40 plus billion dollars of U.S.
[00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.794]  dollars on the market and buying gold bullion.
[00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:32.143]  So this looks like the start of World War I slash World War II.
[00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:34.405]  Very interesting times ahead of us.
[00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:39.129]  So all I can say is brace yourselves, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:46.094]  Now we have Dr. Cordy Gold, who's on one of our big affiliates out in California.
[00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:46.654]  He actually
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:04:04.694]  Well, I guess it goes live in the last hour of this show, and I was scrabbling around trying to find somebody who's pro-Israel to come and give that perspective, because it makes for good radio.
[00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:12.060]  It causes people to think, and this is not a place where we just have one view or one paradigm or one idea put out.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.381]  That's why I've had Ann Coulter on.
[00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:21.264]  That's why I've had Michelle Malkin on, back when they were promoting FEMA camps and concentration camps and the end of the Bill of Rights.
[00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:24.185]  I had him on and disagreed with him.
[00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:34.309]  I don't completely disagree with this Dr. Corey Gold guy, but I do disagree with him on several fronts, and so we'll have him on for a thought-provoking discussion.
[00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:37.430]  Coming up in the next hour, then Dr. John Coleman.
[00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:39.869]  I believe he's a doctor.
[00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:40.950]  I'm going through his bio.
[00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.991]  I haven't interviewed him in years.
[00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:43.453]  Yeah, it's Dr. John Coleman.
[00:04:43.453 --> 00:04:52.303]  He'll be coming on to talk about the Committee of 300, kind of the nexus group between the Bilderberg Group, the Prolateral Commission, and other organizations.
[00:04:52.303 --> 00:04:56.968]  Then we've got Paul Joseph Watson coming on, and a reporter from Bilderberg.
[00:04:56.968 --> 00:04:58.609]  It kicks off today.
[00:04:58.609 --> 00:04:59.490]  So, he'll be joining us.
[00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.960]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.323]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:10.547]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:13.990]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.

[00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:20.475]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[00:05:20.475 --> 00:05:21.616]  Take my word for it.
[00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:24.278]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:30.784]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:05:30.784 --> 00:05:32.305]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:05:36.008 --> 00:05:37.329]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:54.108]  Thank you!
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.063]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:05.426]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:08.651]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:13.757]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:06:13.757 --> 00:06:17.943]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:20.705]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:23.148]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:26.391]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:33.998]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:06:34.338 --> 00:06:39.721]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:06:39.721 --> 00:06:42.583]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:46.265]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:47.346]  And I got news for you.
[00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:48.687]  You're everyone else.
[00:06:48.687 --> 00:06:50.168]  Invisible Empire.

[00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:00.787]  Hi, everyone.
[00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:01.848]  Andy Anderson here.
[00:07:01.848 --> 00:07:06.254]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:12.061]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:07:12.061 --> 00:07:16.406]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.088]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:07:18.248 --> 00:07:19.588]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:23.970]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.190]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:38.193]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria.
[00:07:38.193 --> 00:07:39.254]  Moles and fungus, too.
[00:07:39.254 --> 00:07:40.794]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:44.077]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[00:07:44.077 --> 00:07:45.238]  No more dry skin.
[00:07:45.238 --> 00:07:49.841]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:57.007]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[00:07:57.007 --> 00:07:57.888]  That's 888-245-0300.
[00:07:57.888 --> 00:08:03.712]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:06.474]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:42.674]  Okay, coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to go over all the latest developments dealing with the flotilla that was boarded two days ago by the Israeli Navy.
[00:08:44.119 --> 00:08:49.822]  So that is coming up later in the broadcast today.
[00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:54.004]  And we do have three guests joining us, actually four guests.
[00:08:54.004 --> 00:09:02.287]  We have Dr. Corey Gold coming on the show to give a pro-Israel perspective on what happened coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:02.287 --> 00:09:04.228]  That should be a lively discussion.
[00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:05.329]  Dr. John Coleman.
[00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:06.629]  We're good to go.
[00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:26.241]  Coming up via video Skype for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, not just for radio listeners.
[00:09:26.241 --> 00:09:27.883]  And the first 30 minutes of the last hour.
[00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:33.868]  And then Charlie Skelton, London Guardian reporter, who's at Bilderberg this year.
[00:09:33.868 --> 00:09:35.689]  He'll be joining us.
[00:09:35.689 --> 00:09:38.252]  They just now shut down the hotel today.
[00:09:38.252 --> 00:09:40.954]  They're getting ready for it to start tomorrow.
[00:09:40.954 --> 00:09:46.759]  And of course he's there on the ground talking to other reporters who are getting intel on what's happening at this key meeting.
[00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:49.480]  So he'll be joining us in the last 30 minutes today.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:10:00.366]  He'll also be popping in with more information with us on the radio show tomorrow.
[00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:14.413]  But before I go any further, I want to get into the attack that is taking place on free speech in this nation.
[00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:19.366]  There are literally more than 10 senators I've seen in the news.
[00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:21.307]  I know you've seen them as well.
[00:10:21.307 --> 00:10:41.134]  A whole bunch of the White House czars, like Cass Sunstein and others, the FCC, Time Magazine, the New York Times, Newsweek, I mean, you name it, they're out there promoting and pushing
[00:10:43.832 --> 00:10:50.174]  Attacks on free speech in this nation.
[00:10:50.174 --> 00:11:04.000]  And every day I see three or four, sometimes more, articles all over the news calmly reporting attacks on free speech like it's a good thing.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.162]  And of course the federal government is proposing licensing to have a blog or to be able to post anything on the web.
[00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:16.155]  They are calling for state licensing, not just federal licensing and taxes.
[00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:28.139]  They are calling for a, quote, kindler, gentler internet where you're not allowed to have your own domain, where everything is converted over to a hundred domains controlled by key corporations, government, and select universities.
[00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:31.380]  Then you will have a subdomain with them, but under their rules.
[00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:34.837]  This is what's happening.
[00:11:34.837 --> 00:11:36.478]  And they really are moving to do it.
[00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:42.222]  And Australia is passing laws in their own words, Chinese-style net censorship.
[00:11:42.222 --> 00:11:46.844]  So is France, Italy, England is moving to do it.
[00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:50.146]  Many governments are now providing, quote, free broadband.
[00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:55.028]  Which the entire Internet is converting to, but of course, you're paying for it with tax money.
[00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:56.089]  It's not free.
[00:11:56.089 --> 00:12:07.512]  And under those systems in England, we confirmed two years ago that PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com are not available.
[00:12:07.512 --> 00:12:08.953]  I'm going to repeat that.
[00:12:08.953 --> 00:12:13.494]  They are not available.
[00:12:13.494 --> 00:12:14.815]  You cannot get to them.
[00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:18.556]  Many universities, many high schools, many private corporations
[00:12:19.733 --> 00:12:27.546]  By filtering software that lists now hundreds of thousands of websites and keywords.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.021]  Infowars.com is banned.
[00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:33.343]  PrisonPlanet.com is banned.
[00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:41.169]  Sometimes you can get to our alternative sites that aren't in the list, like Infowars.net, WhatIsTheEndgame.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:12:41.169 --> 00:12:45.132]  People can say, well that's a corporation, well that's a university, well that's the government, let them do what they want.
[00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:46.914]  You know, that's their prerogative.
[00:12:46.914 --> 00:12:52.578]  No, you're paying for the universities, you're paying for the government, quote, free broadband.
[00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:54.139]  It's not free.
[00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:57.382]  The government doesn't offer you something free unless they want to control you.
[00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:01.336]  It's poisoning the well.
[00:13:01.336 --> 00:13:05.579]  That's a great way to get rid of too many wild wolves or coyotes.
[00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:08.581]  You just find their water hole and poison it.
[00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:11.843]  They drink it, they die.
[00:13:11.843 --> 00:13:18.168]  And they're not smart enough to know what's killing their fellow PAC members.
[00:13:18.168 --> 00:13:21.290]  Or a better analogy is how do you domesticate pigs?
[00:13:23.288 --> 00:13:24.689]  How do you domesticate deer?
[00:13:24.689 --> 00:13:26.450]  How do you domesticate horses?
[00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.533]  How did our ancestors domesticate oxen into what they are today?
[00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:33.834]  An Angus cow.
[00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:36.796]  How did they do this?
[00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:44.200]  Well, you simply start putting grain out inside a fenced area with an opening.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.844]  And then one day you just are up in a tree by the fence or hiding in the bushes and at first the younger
[00:13:51.167 --> 00:14:01.412]  Less wily piglets come in and eat the grain, and then the mama sow comes in, and then the daddy boar comes in, and then a whole pack of hogs goes into the pen.
[00:14:01.412 --> 00:14:05.094]  You slip down out of the tree, or come out of your blind, and close the gate.
[00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:09.298]  And then you continue to feed them and get them trained to accept you.
[00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:18.681]  Then you capture a few piglets, you take them and raise them in a pen, or even in and around your hut in the village, and now they're domesticated.
[00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:21.722]  That's what's happening, the domestication of mankind.
[00:14:21.722 --> 00:14:26.724]  And it's the same incremental domestication and scientific control system over the internet.
[00:14:26.724 --> 00:14:31.085]  So I wanted to cover a few articles on that front first.
[00:14:31.085 --> 00:14:32.406]  This is the Hill newspaper.
[00:14:33.553 --> 00:14:38.402]  Groups 1-FCC to police hate speech on talk radio cable news networks.
[00:14:40.287 --> 00:15:01.091]  And of course the FCC concurs and says they have control over the internet and they're calling at the White House for government messages to pop up on your website, on your blog, and they're openly announcing that they want not just equal time on your talk station, they want to create a quote, this is one of the board members of the FCC said last month, a government megaphone.
[00:15:01.091 --> 00:15:02.051]  That was the quote.
[00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:06.332]  Where hours a day to start with of your radio station that you own
[00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:22.900]  As shareholders of a radio group, or as a private owner, or a group of owners, that you will put on government programming during prime time slots, and that the government will break in via the EAS system that you put in in 96, and put messages out.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.101]  I mean, this is all being pushed and promoted right now.
[00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:31.302]  The Federal Communications Commission is being urged to monitor hate speech.
[00:15:31.302 --> 00:15:33.022]  Yes, thought crime, the government will monitor.
[00:15:34.218 --> 00:15:36.219]  On talk radio and cable broadcast networks.
[00:15:36.219 --> 00:15:40.020]  So not only is it you can't say the S word or the F word.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.500]  No, no, no.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.581]  Now it's you can't say the tyranny word.
[00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:45.622]  You can't say the New World Order word.
[00:15:45.622 --> 00:15:47.102]  You can't say the socialist word.
[00:15:47.102 --> 00:15:51.184]  You can't talk about our Lord and Savior, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:15:52.754 --> 00:16:04.872]  A coalition of more than 30 organizations argue in a letter to the FCC that the internet has made it harder for the public to separate the facts from bigotry masquerading as news.
[00:16:04.872 --> 00:16:05.673]  So you better watch it!
[00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:10.904]  The controlled left wants to silence the right, the controlled right.
[00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:18.669]  The controlled right always is talking about silencing, we heard it from Ann Coulter and others, as well as Michelle Malkin, silencing the left.
[00:16:18.669 --> 00:16:24.632]  Well, once you've gouged each other's eyes out and gagged each other, no one can speak.
[00:16:24.632 --> 00:16:29.615]  No, you need to protect free speech, ladies and gentlemen, period, even if you don't agree with it.
[00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:39.032]  The group's also charged that syndicated radio and cable television masquerading as news use hate as a profit model.
[00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:43.253]  And of course, hate is now anything.
[00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:48.595]  I mean, you know, if you say you don't want a war, you're called a hateful terrorist.
[00:16:48.595 --> 00:16:53.637]  Or, if you say you don't want government running your health care, you're a racist.
[00:16:53.637 --> 00:16:56.398]  And of course, they're really the haters injecting race into the issue.
[00:16:57.563 --> 00:17:09.813]  As traditional media have become less diverse and less competitive, they have also grown less responsible and less responsive to the communities that they are supposed to serve, the organization wrote to the FCC.
[00:17:09.813 --> 00:17:18.881]  In the same atmosphere, hate speech thrives as hate has developed as a profit model for syndicated radio and cable television programs masquerading as news.
[00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:26.008]  The organization, which include Free Press, but you've got to love their Orwellian names.
[00:17:26.008 --> 00:17:30.712]  It's like Bush calling it the Patriot Act when it's the opposite of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:17:30.712 --> 00:17:33.113]  The opposite of an American patriot.
[00:17:33.113 --> 00:17:40.219]  Maybe a Hitler-type patriot or a Stalin or Mao-type patriot of restricting free speech, but not an American patriot.
[00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:41.740]  Not a Declaration of Independence.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:48.325]  Not a George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams-type patriot.
[00:17:48.325 --> 00:17:49.125]  No, no, no.
[00:17:51.186 --> 00:17:54.247]  The organizations which include Free Press.
[00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:58.930]  Oh, the organization's called Free Press and they want to take your free press.
[00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.811]  The organizations which include Free Press, the Center for Media Justice.
[00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:02.711]  Oh, they're for justice.
[00:18:02.711 --> 00:18:06.613]  They're for sticking a cork in your mouth, you know, shutting your pie hole.
[00:18:06.613 --> 00:18:14.617]  The Benton Foundation and the Media Alliance also argue that the anonymity of web gives ammunition to those that would spread hatred.
[00:18:17.975 --> 00:18:19.476]  And it goes on from there.
[00:18:19.476 --> 00:18:22.356]  And of course the FCC separately is calling for this censorship.
[00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:23.657]  And here's an article.
[00:18:23.657 --> 00:18:25.978]  It was in the AP and Fox News.
[00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:29.079]  Michigan considers law to license journalists.
[00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:30.519]  Yes.
[00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:34.380]  No free speech unless the government licenses you.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.201]  Yes, you must get licensed from them.
[00:18:37.972 --> 00:18:44.255]  A Michigan lawmaker wants to license reporters to ensure they are credible and vet them for good moral character.
[00:18:44.255 --> 00:18:46.917]  That's how they started 50 years ago in New York City, gun control.
[00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:59.784]  They said, oh, you get your $5 gun permit, just come in and get it, make sure you're not a criminal, and then, oh, sorry, we don't issue those anymore unless you're a local gangster who gives $30,000 to the local politician as a campaign donation.
[00:18:59.784 --> 00:19:01.745]  Sorry, you don't get your free speech now.
[00:19:03.055 --> 00:19:11.522]  Senator Bruce Patterson is introducing legislation that will regulate reporters, much like the state does with hairdressers, auto mechanics, and plumbers.
[00:19:11.522 --> 00:19:13.384]  That means taxing them, folks.
[00:19:13.384 --> 00:19:18.448]  Patterson, who also practices constitutional law, you gotta see, you gotta love that.
[00:19:19.509 --> 00:19:27.492]  That's like, again, the Patriot Act calling it patriotic, or this other group calling themselves the Free Press Group that wants to ban the free press.
[00:19:27.492 --> 00:19:29.933]  Senator Bruce Patterson, in fact, let's get this idiot on.
[00:19:29.933 --> 00:19:31.814]  Let's try to get him on.
[00:19:31.814 --> 00:19:39.417]  Senator Bruce Patterson is introducing legislation that will regulate reporters, much like the state does with hairdressers, auto mechanics, and plumbers.
[00:19:40.057 --> 00:19:42.059]  See how it's being pitched like it's reasonable?
[00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:52.647]  Patterson, who also practices constitutional laws, says the general public is being overwhelmed with an increasing number of media outlets, traditional, online, and citizen-generated, and even greater amount of misinformation.
[00:19:52.647 --> 00:19:58.612]  Oh, you practice constitutional law, but you're saying, butcher the First Amendment, freedom of the press.
[00:19:58.612 --> 00:19:59.713]  Sorry, punk!
[00:19:59.713 --> 00:20:00.494]  You don't get to!
[00:20:00.914 --> 00:20:01.594]  You worry.
[00:20:01.594 --> 00:20:03.955]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:20:03.955 --> 00:20:04.495]  Hi.
[00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:07.296]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:20:07.296 --> 00:20:11.837]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:20:11.837 --> 00:20:14.298]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:17.319]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:20:17.739 --> 00:20:18.279]  We're good to go.
[00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:39.225]  I think so.
[00:21:00.914 --> 00:21:07.580]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:15.706]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.706 --> 00:21:21.271]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:23.853]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:21:23.853 --> 00:21:28.956]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:34.180]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.883]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.523 --> 00:21:39.604]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.604 --> 00:21:44.108]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:44.108 --> 00:21:49.012]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:49.012 --> 00:21:52.015]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:52.015 --> 00:21:53.796]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.796 --> 00:21:54.016]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.013 --> 00:22:07.196]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:22:07.196 --> 00:22:13.600]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.343]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:22:19.343 --> 00:22:21.784]  Starve or surrender.
[00:22:21.784 --> 00:22:26.106]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:22:26.106 --> 00:22:26.987]  What then?
[00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:32.806]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:22:32.806 --> 00:22:37.128]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:22:37.128 --> 00:22:39.989]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:47.231]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:49.112]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:22:49.112 --> 00:22:54.533]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[00:22:54.533 --> 00:22:57.254]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:22:57.254 --> 00:22:58.115]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:00.979]  Fact.
[00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:01.140]  Fact.
[00:23:30.299 --> 00:23:32.139]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:34.010]  I need to have one of our writers, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Kurt Nemo, Aaron Dykes, or any of the other op-ed writers we've got out there, do a boil-down story of just mainstream articles taking quotes out of it where senators, congressmen, and women, White House czars, judges, FCC board members,
[00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:37.971]  Mainstream media.
[00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:44.317]  I mean, every day I see three or four articles without looking where they're calling for restricting free speech.
[00:24:44.317 --> 00:24:49.042]  We need like a 10-page article that says, yes, they're coming after your free speech.
[00:24:50.782 --> 00:24:53.764]  And then just boil it down with bullet points.
[00:24:53.764 --> 00:24:57.746]  Because you look at a couple of these articles, you're like, oh, those are just crackpots.
[00:24:57.746 --> 00:24:59.527]  You know, that's just a few people in government.
[00:24:59.527 --> 00:25:00.208]  No!
[00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:02.849]  They are beating a steady drum.
[00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:07.192]  And just three or four years ago, government and media would never do this.
[00:25:07.192 --> 00:25:10.434]  They would never openly call for restricting free speech.
[00:25:11.414 --> 00:25:22.719]  Now they're doing it because old mainline establishment, especially what you call liberal media, is dying, is going down in flames, is almost gone.
[00:25:22.719 --> 00:25:33.904]  I mean, the mast of the ship are now all that's sticking up, and those are rapidly receding beneath the wine-dark ocean surface.
[00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:52.884]  And so they are racing and you've got this perfect storm of mainstream dying dinosaur media on its back flailing with the corrupt government run by offshore corporations that's looting the United States, Western Europe, and the rest of the industrialized world.
[00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:58.025]  And you've got the system losing all credibility as Zbigniew Brzezinski said two weeks ago for the first time ever.
[00:25:58.025 --> 00:26:02.126]  He said the whole world is awake to the world government and their system is in trouble.
[00:26:03.632 --> 00:26:05.973]  See, they're not arrogant anymore, folks.
[00:26:05.973 --> 00:26:08.835]  Before, they said, write your blogs, have your talk radio.
[00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:09.676]  We don't care.
[00:26:09.676 --> 00:26:11.016]  Now they're like, emergency!
[00:26:11.016 --> 00:26:11.977]  Emergency!
[00:26:11.977 --> 00:26:15.639]  Shut them down!
[00:26:15.639 --> 00:26:17.781]  Sir, we're losing orbit.
[00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:18.941]  We're going into the atmosphere.
[00:26:18.941 --> 00:26:20.102]  We're going to burn up.
[00:26:20.102 --> 00:26:20.942]  Shut them down!
[00:26:20.942 --> 00:26:22.223]  Shut them down now!
[00:26:22.223 --> 00:26:23.284]  Sir, it's too late!
[00:26:23.284 --> 00:26:25.685]  We can't!
[00:26:25.685 --> 00:26:28.147]  I mean, that's basically the situation we've reached.
[00:26:29.537 --> 00:26:33.119]  We are blowing the living daylights out of the New World Order, and they know it.
[00:26:33.119 --> 00:26:34.380]  And so they're pulling out all the stops.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.521]  Don't criticize the takeover of healthcare!
[00:26:36.521 --> 00:26:38.382]  Don't criticize the banking takeover!
[00:26:38.382 --> 00:26:41.824]  You're a racist!
[00:26:41.824 --> 00:26:43.265]  Don't vote for Rand Paul!
[00:26:43.265 --> 00:26:45.527]  RACIST!
[00:26:45.527 --> 00:26:47.328]  They're like, emergency, hit the race button!
[00:26:47.328 --> 00:26:48.829]  It's not working either!
[00:26:48.829 --> 00:26:50.109]  What are we gonna do?
[00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:53.672]  They don't- The people don't care what we say about them anymore if we demonize them.
[00:26:53.672 --> 00:26:54.492]  What are we gonna do?
[00:26:54.492 --> 00:26:56.473]  We're losing mind control over them!
[00:26:56.473 --> 00:26:57.314]  What are we gonna do?
[00:27:01.414 --> 00:27:11.311]  I mean, look at this Fox News article quoting the bill, written by a supposed constitutional law scholar.
[00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:14.416]  Michigan considers law to license journalists.
[00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:25.687]  And it goes on, according to the bill, reporters must provide the licensing board proof of, which makes the licensing board God.
[00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:35.835]  And the minions, the staffers, like in East Germany, to have a play, or to make a television program, or to write a script, or to own a typewriter, you had to have special licenses.
[00:27:35.835 --> 00:27:43.841]  And, of course, the men who were over the media and the culture got to have all the beautiful women and all the power, and everyone worshipped them.
[00:27:44.361 --> 00:27:49.745]  Oh yes, the government boards over the arts and entertainment, like Sarkozy in France.
[00:27:49.745 --> 00:27:52.307]  Or I think it's the movie star wife.
[00:27:52.307 --> 00:27:54.208]  He funds almost all the media over there.
[00:27:54.208 --> 00:27:55.469]  It's a sickening joke.
[00:27:55.469 --> 00:27:57.891]  Well, we're going to be like that here too.
[00:27:57.891 --> 00:28:00.533]  Paying a license to have a television set.
[00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:05.976]  Oh yes, Obama's people are proposing that.
[00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:08.398]  Now listen, this is quotes from the bill.
[00:28:08.398 --> 00:28:12.941]  Good moral character and demonstrate they have industry ethics standards acceptable to the board.
[00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:13.422]  That's a quote.
[00:28:14.375 --> 00:28:17.179]  So, the government decides what moral character is.
[00:28:17.179 --> 00:28:21.886]  Handing your guns in, worshipping big government, lying for the government.
[00:28:21.886 --> 00:28:24.409]  The government's going to tell you what moral character is.
[00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:25.831]  They will decide.
[00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:27.374]  Completely arbitrary.
[00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:29.997]  Possession of a degree in journalism or other degree
[00:28:31.707 --> 00:28:33.387]  Substantially equivalent.
[00:28:33.387 --> 00:28:36.608]  So you can't even then be at a student paper because you have to have the degree first.
[00:28:36.608 --> 00:28:43.210]  Not less than three years experience as a reporter or any other relevant background information.
[00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:47.731]  You must have three years experience as a reporter to be able to be a reporter.
[00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:50.252]  So when all the reporters die, there'll never be another reporter again.
[00:28:52.256 --> 00:28:57.019]  Remember when Beelo was putting on the debates for the Republican primary?
[00:28:57.019 --> 00:29:03.364]  And they weren't going to let Debra Medina in, even though she had 15% of the vote or more in the polls, somewhere as high as 20.
[00:29:03.364 --> 00:29:08.267]  And they said, well, you have to have a statewide position first of senator or governor.
[00:29:08.267 --> 00:29:12.070]  So you can't run for governor unless you've already been a senator or a governor.
[00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.592]  And of course, people laughed at them, and so they had to back off of that.
[00:29:15.592 --> 00:29:18.995]  But it shows what they're... I mean, you just heard me read from the bill.
[00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:24.841]  You gotta have three years experience as a reporter to ever be a reporter.
[00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:27.002]  That's interesting logic.
[00:29:27.002 --> 00:29:34.647]  It's like saying you've gotta be a woman who's had children to be born as a woman.
[00:29:34.647 --> 00:29:43.052]  You have to have awards or recognition related to being a reporter, three or more writing samples, and you'll have to pay an application and registration fee.
[00:29:45.438 --> 00:29:47.300]  And they're not the only state proposing this.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.263]  It's going on in Washington State.
[00:29:49.263 --> 00:29:51.105]  Stay with us!
[00:29:51.105 --> 00:29:52.487]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.487 --> 00:29:55.010]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.713]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:05.373]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:30:05.373 --> 00:30:06.374]  What have we got?
[00:30:06.374 --> 00:30:08.815]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:30:08.815 --> 00:30:09.816]  A republic.
[00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:12.478]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:14.739]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:30:14.739 --> 00:30:16.760]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.441]  So they think they own our land?
[00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:19.762]  They think they own our water?
[00:30:19.762 --> 00:30:20.382]  Children?
[00:30:20.382 --> 00:30:21.483]  Our education?
[00:30:21.483 --> 00:30:22.324]  Our money?
[00:30:22.324 --> 00:30:25.966]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:30:26.326 --> 00:30:31.312]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:30:31.312 --> 00:30:32.333]  We have the facts.
[00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:33.494]  We have the Constitution.
[00:30:33.494 --> 00:30:34.396]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:30:34.396 --> 00:30:35.297]  We have common law.
[00:30:35.297 --> 00:30:37.820]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.763]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:30:40.763 --> 00:30:41.584]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:30:41.684 --> 00:30:46.649]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:30:46.649 --> 00:30:48.151]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:30:48.151 --> 00:30:49.232]  Don't tread on me.
[00:30:49.232 --> 00:30:56.119]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:01.620]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:07.202]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:07.202 --> 00:31:12.224]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:12.224 --> 00:31:17.266]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:31:17.806 --> 00:31:23.030]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:30.134]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:30.134 --> 00:31:31.255]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:31.255 --> 00:31:37.960]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.142]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:41.142 --> 00:31:44.284]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:47.926 --> 00:31:50.889]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:50.889 --> 00:31:56.995]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:56.995 --> 00:31:59.378]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:00.694 --> 00:32:03.695]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.695 --> 00:32:09.037]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.037 --> 00:32:11.078]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.078 --> 00:32:16.079]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:17.260]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.000]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.262]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.262 --> 00:32:21.344]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.344 --> 00:32:23.546]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.546 --> 00:32:24.888]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.888 --> 00:32:26.410]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:31.696]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.696 --> 00:32:34.820]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.081]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:39.081 --> 00:32:40.302]  How much will you need?
[00:32:40.302 --> 00:32:41.202]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.202 --> 00:32:42.322]  How much do you want?
[00:32:42.322 --> 00:32:43.043]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.043 --> 00:32:44.343]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:44.343 --> 00:32:47.384]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.384 --> 00:32:49.165]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:49.165 --> 00:32:50.065]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:20.411]  There's one life, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not living it on my knees as a slave.
[00:33:20.411 --> 00:33:31.473]  I want you to suck some air into your lungs and feel the spirit of liberty rising in your soul, in your heart.
[00:33:31.473 --> 00:33:41.995]  And make the commitment to wage war against every form of tyranny over the mind and bodies of this human species.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.162]  Slavery isn't fun.
[00:33:48.162 --> 00:33:50.645]  Slavery is degradation and pain.
[00:33:50.645 --> 00:34:01.034]  But the animated contest of liberty is truly what this journey of life is all about.
[00:34:01.034 --> 00:34:04.157]  So get your motor running, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:04.157 --> 00:34:07.019]  Head out on that highway of life.
[00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:11.303]  You will find the adventure of liberty.
[00:34:11.303 --> 00:34:12.564]  You're only alive once.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.182]  Doesn't matter if you're 15 years old or 80.
[00:34:16.182 --> 00:34:19.024]  There's still time to live.
[00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:23.087]  There's still time to fulfill your destiny.
[00:34:23.087 --> 00:34:29.492]  To stand up for freedom and liberty for this species.
[00:34:29.492 --> 00:34:31.833]  Okay, I want to go through masses of news.
[00:34:31.833 --> 00:34:35.936]  Of course, starting with the latest developments with the flotilla raid two and a half days ago.
[00:34:37.236 --> 00:34:48.680]  The incredible fallout from this rivaling the crises on the Korean Peninsula.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:54.282]  But before we get into all of that, I want to thank a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio transmission possible.
[00:34:54.282 --> 00:34:56.443]  One of them is eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:34:56.443 --> 00:34:58.584]  The letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[00:34:59.571 --> 00:35:08.638]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive, and one of our longest and best sponsors, eFoods Direct, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[00:35:08.638 --> 00:35:13.482]  They're also the biggest and the highest quality, no GMO, no hybrid garbage.
[00:35:13.482 --> 00:35:18.086]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for decades.
[00:35:18.086 --> 00:35:22.709]  With the looming implosion of the economy, with all the uncertainty, with everything that's going on,
[00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.131]  I bought storable food from other companies.
[00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:28.433]  It was GMO, MSG-filled crud, and it was old.
[00:35:28.433 --> 00:35:31.534]  This is brand new, made every month, right here in the U.S.
[00:35:31.534 --> 00:35:33.235]  in good old Utah.
[00:35:33.235 --> 00:35:41.419]  So, check it out today at efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[00:35:41.419 --> 00:35:44.681]  I want to tell you about another great sponsor.
[00:35:44.681 --> 00:35:51.745]  It's all about true sustainability, true independence, not being beholden on the nanny state if we have another Great Depression.
[00:35:53.254 --> 00:35:59.037]  Plus, you don't want to be drinking all that sodium fluoride and the mercury and the lead and all the stuff the government puts in the water.
[00:35:59.037 --> 00:36:00.558]  Well, they don't let it in the water.
[00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.599]  They put it in the water under the name sodium fluoride.
[00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:04.560]  I'm going to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.882]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com, one word.
[00:36:09.882 --> 00:36:12.364]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[00:36:12.364 --> 00:36:18.006]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[00:36:18.006 --> 00:36:22.729]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower bath filters.
[00:36:23.942 --> 00:36:25.884]  All their filters are made in the good old U.S.
[00:36:25.884 --> 00:36:27.766]  of A. Well, it still exists.
[00:36:27.766 --> 00:36:34.513]  Check out their banners at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com and take control of your water supply today.
[00:36:34.513 --> 00:36:35.654]  PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:36:35.654 --> 00:36:38.116]  Okay.
[00:36:38.116 --> 00:36:45.263]  Lastly, I'm a documentary filmmaker and I've produced other films like Loose Change, Final Cut and Invisible Empire, New World Order, Defined.
[00:36:46.414 --> 00:36:53.746]  When you get Invisible Empire in the Order Defined, you can get Fabled Enemies for $9.95, and for $5.95, you get Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:36:58.635 --> 00:37:02.138]  And you may know all about the New World Order, but the general public doesn't.
[00:37:02.138 --> 00:37:11.484]  We also are carrying the great film that I consulted on in Amman, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, How to Take the Country Back at the State Level, Where Were You?
[00:37:11.484 --> 00:37:13.566]  The Start of the Second American Revolution.
[00:37:13.566 --> 00:37:21.632]  That's available on DVD at InfoWars.com, and your purchase of the books, videos, materials, and your PrisonPlanet.tv memberships funds this operation.
[00:37:21.632 --> 00:37:22.893]  So we couldn't do it without you.
[00:37:22.893 --> 00:37:25.695]  I salute all of you out there, and thank you for your continued support.
[00:37:26.883 --> 00:37:29.366]  Okay, let's get rolling with the news.
[00:37:29.366 --> 00:37:39.737]  We've got Dr. Corey Gold joining us in the next hour, then Dr. John Coleman, then Paul Watson, and then Charlie Skelton from Bilderberg Group over in Spain.
[00:37:39.737 --> 00:37:41.498]  We're also working on other folks like
[00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:43.380]  Two Kerr.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.063]  Jim Tucker was scheduled to be on today, but his plane got delayed by 24 hours.
[00:37:47.063 --> 00:37:47.843]  That is not good.
[00:37:47.843 --> 00:37:51.166]  We're going to work on getting one of the other American Free Press reporters on with him.
[00:37:51.166 --> 00:37:54.488]  We're also working, we've got the London Guardian reporter coming on today.
[00:37:54.488 --> 00:37:57.850]  I'm working on some other freelance reporters that are there to get different perspectives.
[00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:02.976]  Uh, from, uh, different news agencies on what's going on.
[00:38:02.976 --> 00:38:05.879]  But Charlie Skelton witnessed the lockdown of the hotel.
[00:38:05.879 --> 00:38:07.901]  They're going to be meeting tomorrow, today.
[00:38:07.901 --> 00:38:11.405]  So we'll get that first report on that today.
[00:38:11.405 --> 00:38:12.926]  I, of course, was on Russia Today.
[00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:24.173]  Yesterday, reporting on the criminal Bilderberg Group and its push for world government, the fact that the European Parliament heard testimony by Daniel Estelin yesterday.
[00:38:24.173 --> 00:38:42.227]  That's how mainstream this is getting to the full EU Parliament on the fact that every major EU appointee, because the way the bureaucracy works is the Parliament's elected but they have no power, like the General Assembly of the UN, they're a debating club under the bureaucracy of the EU and Herman Van Rompuy.
[00:38:42.907 --> 00:38:57.794]  And so the people that should have the power, the elected representatives, they are now pointing out that the puppet EU system that is above the elected parliament is all Bilderberg Group.
[00:38:57.794 --> 00:39:01.396]  So this is the beginning of the defeat of the euro.
[00:39:01.716 --> 00:39:13.161]  Hey, if people in Germany, and France, and the Netherlands, and everywhere else, and Turkey, and Greece for that matter, and Spain, and Portugal, if they want to have a union, good for them!
[00:39:13.161 --> 00:39:14.461]  But it should be a republic.
[00:39:14.461 --> 00:39:16.982]  It should be truly democratic.
[00:39:16.982 --> 00:39:19.783]  A constitutional democracy.
[00:39:19.783 --> 00:39:22.384]  Meaning, a republican democracy.
[00:39:22.384 --> 00:39:26.586]  Meaning, you can't have 51% voting to take the other 49%'s rights.
[00:39:26.586 --> 00:39:28.187]  But this is worse than that.
[00:39:28.187 --> 00:39:30.968]  You've got unelected bureaucracy that
[00:39:32.082 --> 00:39:36.566]  That never even allowed votes in the EU on entrance.
[00:39:36.566 --> 00:39:44.334]  And then bureaucrats and treacherous Prime Ministers and Presidents signed them over to it.
[00:39:44.334 --> 00:39:47.637]  By the way, will you guys call Nigel Farage today?
[00:39:47.637 --> 00:39:50.099]  We keep forgetting and see how he did after his plane wreck.
[00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:53.022]  Will you call Mr. Bloom and get him back on?
[00:39:53.022 --> 00:39:55.144]  And then we'll get Nigel Farage.
[00:39:57.267 --> 00:40:01.788]  Because we keep sitting around the office going, I wonder how he did in his election.
[00:40:01.788 --> 00:40:02.668]  In fact, let's look that up.
[00:40:02.668 --> 00:40:06.469]  We never even looked up how he did in his... He was a member of the European Union Parliament.
[00:40:06.469 --> 00:40:07.849]  He was running for the British Parliament.
[00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:10.910]  Let's look up Nigel Farage and see how he did after his plane crash.
[00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.150]  I think I've said that about... Well, doesn't matter.
[00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.391]  We're going to find out right now.
[00:40:14.391 --> 00:40:19.412]  We're going to find out right now what happened with that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:19.412 --> 00:40:24.853]  I'm brainstorming here live on the air.
[00:40:24.853 --> 00:40:25.053]  Okay.
[00:40:27.449 --> 00:40:36.893]  I better hurry and get to the news before they pass laws and I have to go through a government board and be certified before I have any free speech, because after all, that's the American way.
[00:40:36.893 --> 00:40:42.515]  And if you're against banning free speech without a government license, you must be a racist.
[00:40:42.515 --> 00:40:43.435]  What's that have to do with it?
[00:40:43.435 --> 00:40:47.837]  Nothing, but it's a political hot button they throw in.
[00:40:47.837 --> 00:40:52.239]  That's why I point out how asinine it is every time we cover a new subject.
[00:40:52.239 --> 00:40:52.479]  Okay.
[00:40:54.994 --> 00:41:04.797]  I'm just going to read a smattering of headlines here, not making any judgment, just so you can roll this around in your mind before I give you my take on things.
[00:41:04.797 --> 00:41:06.558]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:41:06.558 --> 00:41:10.159]  Turkey calls on Israel to end blockade to restore ties.
[00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:22.723]  More ships, including a large ship from Ireland carrying a Nobel laureate, are approaching the area where the Israelis, two and a half days ago, boarded the six ships.
[00:41:24.704 --> 00:41:38.193]  Turkey demanded Israeli government lift its blockade of Gaza as a condition for normalizing relations, but added it was time that calm replaced anger after Israel's deadly raid on Turkish-backed aid flotilla.
[00:41:40.037 --> 00:41:53.964]  So, you know, that was political posturing by Turkey, I'm sure, saying, we're going to send warships to protect the next ship, knowing that it would be popular with the Turkish people, and then now, the next day, saying we're not going to do that.
[00:41:53.964 --> 00:41:57.525]  But if Israel goes after other ships, it's just going to continue.
[00:42:00.566 --> 00:42:01.867]  I don't follow what the U.N.
[00:42:01.867 --> 00:42:02.447]  has to say.
[00:42:02.447 --> 00:42:09.873]  People keep quoting the U.N., criminal organization, but it is saying that, and Israel, of course, doesn't follow the U.N.
[00:42:09.873 --> 00:42:12.555]  either, but you can't have your cake and eat it, too.
[00:42:12.555 --> 00:42:18.460]  A lot of you don't like Israel and what things it does, but then you don't like the U.N., but then people will quote the U.N.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.343]  as saying it's illegal, Israel's blockade of Gaza.
[00:42:22.343 --> 00:42:23.403]  And I tend to agree.
[00:42:23.403 --> 00:42:26.306]  I mean, four years of blocking anything coming into the country?
[00:42:27.489 --> 00:42:27.629]  I don't
[00:42:44.833 --> 00:42:47.294]  Links on Flotilla.
[00:42:47.294 --> 00:42:53.998]  And they've already shown us the knives and wooden clubs that are being called basically WMDs.
[00:42:53.998 --> 00:42:56.319]  It's like they're saying the Atari Militia.
[00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:58.020]  Guns are WMDs now.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.001]  Weapons of Mass Destruction.
[00:43:00.001 --> 00:43:01.181]  But there is a big development.
[00:43:01.181 --> 00:43:03.503]  I've been analyzing the videos since I saw this morning.
[00:43:03.503 --> 00:43:04.683]  We go live on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:43:06.384 --> 00:43:17.614]  Uh, towards the end of the next hour, I'm gonna play the clip where the Israelis say it shows the people on board the big Turkish flagship throwing flashbangs.
[00:43:17.614 --> 00:43:19.115]  And it does look like that.
[00:43:19.115 --> 00:43:26.941]  And you did have the pro-Gaza group saying that Israel was firing on them first and pointing to the sounds of bangs.
[00:43:28.052 --> 00:43:32.958]  And then you see the Israeli commandos come down on ropes and they're being beaten with clubs.
[00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:36.382]  But the Arab media was saying, well, that's because they were shooting at them first.
[00:43:36.382 --> 00:43:41.407]  But if indeed, and I just go to the facts, folks, I just report the facts here.
[00:43:41.407 --> 00:43:48.716]  If you've got bangs going off and it's really flash bangs being thrown, and we've got this video up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:52.384 --> 00:44:01.107]  If indeed they're throwing the flashbangs first, then that completely changes the situation, doesn't it?
[00:44:03.154 --> 00:44:06.556]  But also Israel claiming they had guns and all these weapons at first.
[00:44:06.556 --> 00:44:08.697]  Well, why weren't any of the IDF shot?
[00:44:08.697 --> 00:44:10.298]  So I think both sides are spinning this.
[00:44:10.298 --> 00:44:13.380]  There's a fog of conflict and war here.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.661]  But we'll always find out in hindsight exactly what happened.
[00:44:15.661 --> 00:44:18.223]  We're continuing to analyze it.
[00:44:18.223 --> 00:44:18.603]  U.S.
[00:44:18.603 --> 00:44:22.565]  consulate issues advisory for Israel, for U.S.
[00:44:22.565 --> 00:44:23.926]  citizens traveling there.
[00:44:27.148 --> 00:44:29.170]  Yeah, I don't know why anybody travels to Israel.
[00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:30.230]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.212]  I mean, it's like people say, travel to Mexico.
[00:44:32.212 --> 00:44:34.073]  It's even more dangerous.
[00:44:34.073 --> 00:44:41.939]  I mean, there's no way I'd send, you know, college-age kids there, like so many parents do, to Mexico, especially.
[00:44:41.939 --> 00:44:50.366]  We got an email here from Birgitta, and it basically reports the same thing that Jerusalem Post is reporting.
[00:44:55.008 --> 00:45:02.910]  And, uh, it... Well, I'm going to get to that in a moment, but Turkish lawmakers urge government to review Israeli ties.
[00:45:05.506 --> 00:45:09.109]  You've got to love how they're sending out this pro-Israel email.
[00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:12.453]  They say, keep this to yourself.
[00:45:12.453 --> 00:45:13.814]  No one is supposed to get this.
[00:45:13.814 --> 00:45:16.576]  This is what IDF soldiers are telling me what happened.
[00:45:16.576 --> 00:45:20.400]  And then it's sent out as a mass email so everybody does spread it.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.982]  Shh, don't give this to anybody.
[00:45:22.982 --> 00:45:26.866]  That's kind of like Trent Reznor put out a fake police state video two weeks ago.
[00:45:27.907 --> 00:45:32.349]  You know, at the start of the video it says, don't give this to anyone, so it goes viral.
[00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:35.470]  I mean, we don't use tricks like that here on the show to get the word out, folks.
[00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:37.230]  We just say this is important info.
[00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.831]  We hope you get it out to everyone.
[00:45:39.831 --> 00:45:47.594]  But nevertheless, Israel has put up on YouTube a video of what shows the Arabs, what looks like throwing flash banks, or the pro-Gaza group.
[00:45:50.492 --> 00:45:56.874]  The problem is, the CIA admitted to the Washington Post last week, they have produced fake Bin Laden videos.
[00:45:56.874 --> 00:45:58.775]  Of course, we already knew that.
[00:45:58.775 --> 00:46:01.356]  So, how do we believe anything?
[00:46:01.356 --> 00:46:07.358]  Though the video does look real, and watching the old Bin Laden videos, you could tell they were fake.
[00:46:08.275 --> 00:46:22.225]  uh... it's it's it's it's pretty hard to fake these action videos or it ends up looking like you know some type of a video game uh... this looks pretty real but again time will tell pergish lawmakers urge government to review israeli ties
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:35.851]  Turkey's parliament called on the government Wednesday to review all ties with Israel as the country prepared a huge welcome home for hundreds of Turks detained after Israel's bloody raid on the Gaza-bound aid flotilla.
[00:46:35.851 --> 00:46:37.692]  That's the Associated Press.
[00:46:37.692 --> 00:46:40.615]  Here's the Jerusalem Post if you want to go watch the video.
[00:46:40.615 --> 00:46:43.878]  The headline is, activists threw stun grenades.
[00:46:43.878 --> 00:46:47.621]  This is also up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:46:51.482 --> 00:47:04.070]  The IDF spokesperson's office on Wednesday afternoon released more new footage of Gaza flotilla activists attacking soldiers with a stun grenade, a box of plates, and water hoses.
[00:47:05.083 --> 00:47:09.965]  Now Fox News was trying to say yesterday that maybe it was fake video from Al Jazeera.
[00:47:09.965 --> 00:47:13.527]  Well, Al Jazeera's video backs up the Israeli account.
[00:47:13.527 --> 00:47:23.591]  I mean, how do you think Al Jazeera fakes video live on the deck of the ship when the Israeli commandos are coming down with their guns slung and being beaten?
[00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:24.932]  That's not fake video.
[00:47:24.932 --> 00:47:29.254]  Why would Al Jazeera put out video that backs up the Israeli account?
[00:47:31.288 --> 00:47:37.586]  Fox News just really engages in moronic propaganda.
[00:47:37.586 --> 00:47:39.210]  Just like the pro-Gaza group.
[00:47:42.165 --> 00:47:46.788]  You know, saying that they didn't beat anybody for the first day backfired on them.
[00:47:46.788 --> 00:48:01.638]  I mean, yeah, they were attacking people, but the issue is this was international waters, and a lot of former Israeli Mossad folks, in fact, I'm going to go over some of that in a minute, they're saying that this was illegal, and the way I read it, it was illegal.
[00:48:01.638 --> 00:48:06.181]  Why didn't they do it once it got in Israeli waters?
[00:48:06.181 --> 00:48:08.162]  It's a brazenness.
[00:48:08.162 --> 00:48:08.963]  It's an arrogance.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:17.809]  Uh... that we can do whatever we want, because, you know, we've been attacked before and we're a little country and, you know, uh... we don't care what the world thinks.
[00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:18.750]  Well, whatever.
[00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:29.501]  It's a PR disaster any way you slice it, but I guess you're supposed to, you know, be part of the pro-Israel cult where no one can criticize anything and just... just do whatever Benjamin Netanyahu says.
[00:48:30.642 --> 00:48:41.769]  The IDF spokesperson's office on Wednesday afternoon released more new footage of Gaza flotilla activists attacking soldiers with a stun grenade, a box of plates and water hoses.
[00:48:41.769 --> 00:48:43.490]  Now again, I'm going to say this.
[00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:51.795]  I get attacked by the white supremacists and the Israel haters, and it's a wide spectrum of people who are in that camp, for not attacking Israel enough.
[00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:56.377]  Then I got attacked by the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, for not worshipping Israel.
[00:48:57.458 --> 00:48:58.941]  And I'm just sick of it.
[00:48:58.941 --> 00:49:00.784]  I'm sick of hearing about Israel all the time.
[00:49:00.784 --> 00:49:07.674]  I'm sick of having to launch all these wars because the American Christians believe that
[00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:17.485]  That they're going to bring about the end of the world and the return of Jesus by causing World War III in the Middle East?
[00:49:17.485 --> 00:49:19.826]  Look, I don't want World War III, okay?
[00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:21.507]  I don't want war with North Korea.
[00:49:21.507 --> 00:49:23.388]  I don't want war with Pakistan.
[00:49:23.388 --> 00:49:24.769]  I don't want to be in Iraq.
[00:49:24.769 --> 00:49:26.209]  I'm sick of it, okay?
[00:49:26.209 --> 00:49:28.971]  I know it's about weapon sales and oil and power.
[00:49:29.631 --> 00:49:31.013]  And securing Israel's flank.
[00:49:31.013 --> 00:49:32.015]  I'm tired of it.
[00:49:32.015 --> 00:49:35.960]  I'm tired of the arrogant statements by Israeli Prime Ministers and the media.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.904]  And it's in the Jerusalem Post, so don't deny it.
[00:49:38.904 --> 00:49:41.949]  Saying, you know, America's in our hip pocket.
[00:49:41.949 --> 00:49:43.591]  I mean, I'm tired of it.
[00:49:43.591 --> 00:49:45.293]  I mean, that's why Israel gets so much criticism.
[00:49:47.645 --> 00:49:51.246]  And I don't think that, you know, Israel controls the United States.
[00:49:51.246 --> 00:50:00.808]  I think it's one of the big lobbies who have the same interest as the weapons manufacturers and the oil companies and, you know, mainline Christian conservatives that just love war.
[00:50:00.808 --> 00:50:02.689]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:50:02.689 --> 00:50:08.030]  It's disgusting to watch good old boys piling into liquor stores every time this country starts a new war.
[00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:12.791]  I've talked to liquor store owners I know, and also I know a fellow that owns a pizza shop.
[00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:17.002]  And I say, when do you sell the most food?
[00:50:17.002 --> 00:50:17.963]  When do you sell the most liquor?
[00:50:17.963 --> 00:50:19.484]  And they say, you know when?
[00:50:19.484 --> 00:50:21.385]  When the new war starts.
[00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:27.187]  People just get drunk for weeks and these good old boys with John Wayne pictures hanging up in their house.
[00:50:27.187 --> 00:50:31.309]  I don't dislike John Wayne folks, I just don't like the cult of war.
[00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:41.995]  And they just buy liquor and beer and food and they just get drunk and feel manly and cry watching buildings blowing up and feel a manly extension through it.
[00:50:41.995 --> 00:50:42.755]  I'm tired of it!
[00:50:44.298 --> 00:50:48.540]  I'm tired of it.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.941]  I'm sick of it.
[00:50:50.941 --> 00:50:53.082]  And I want my sovereignty.
[00:50:53.082 --> 00:50:53.702]  Okay?
[00:50:53.702 --> 00:50:55.923]  I want to follow what George Washington said.
[00:50:55.923 --> 00:50:57.063]  I want to be our own country.
[00:50:57.063 --> 00:50:58.204]  I want to leave everybody alone.
[00:50:58.204 --> 00:51:03.246]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:03.246 --> 00:51:04.466]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.466 --> 00:51:06.327]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:08.859 --> 00:51:16.087]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:16.087 --> 00:51:20.491]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.

[00:52:45.948 --> 00:52:49.509]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:49.509 --> 00:52:51.489]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:52.589]  It's here.

[00:54:14.466 --> 00:54:17.226]  He headed up Israeli weapons development for the Navy.
[00:54:17.226 --> 00:54:22.848]  Then he was recruited by the Mossad, and he wrote a book, Critical.
[00:54:25.077 --> 00:54:32.079]  of Israel, of the Mossad, by way of deception, but he's pro-Israel overall, but you're not allowed to do that, see?
[00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:40.801]  You can't even be an Israeli Jew and be a former captain and then a Mossad officer and then criticize what he called corruption and lying.
[00:54:40.801 --> 00:54:43.942]  Well, of course intelligence agencies are corrupt and lying.
[00:54:44.892 --> 00:54:46.073]  See, that's what's insane.
[00:54:46.073 --> 00:54:50.517]  I mean, the CIA is on record shipping narcotics out of Vietnam and Afghanistan.
[00:54:50.517 --> 00:54:58.964]  They're currently shipping narcotics out of Afghanistan, and are so arrogant they come out and admit it, and then if I say I'm against the CIA shipping drugs in here, I'm unpatriotic.
[00:54:58.964 --> 00:55:01.286]  No, they're unpatriotic.
[00:55:01.286 --> 00:55:02.727]  That's the same thing.
[00:55:02.727 --> 00:55:05.970]  To claim that Israel's all lily-white is delusional.
[00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:13.156]  And that's why people who just blindly defend everything Israel does actually discredit Israel more than just being honest about the fact.
[00:55:14.994 --> 00:55:19.439]  That any time you give a government total carte blanche to do whatever it wants, it's gonna get corrupt.
[00:55:19.439 --> 00:55:20.761]  Just like our country.
[00:55:20.761 --> 00:55:23.244]  The National Security Act.
[00:55:23.244 --> 00:55:27.829]  Since 1947, they can do whatever they want in total darkness.
[00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:29.071]  Unlimited funding.
[00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:30.693]  Of course we have a criminal government!
[00:55:32.958 --> 00:55:36.519]  Of course the government's taking people's pension funds now and gearing up to take them all.
[00:55:36.519 --> 00:55:38.340]  No one is safe.
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:43.102]  All these groups use your phony patriotism so you shut off your thinking process.
[00:55:43.102 --> 00:55:43.962]  Not me.
[00:55:43.962 --> 00:55:50.264]  Viktor Ostrovsky is in the Washington Post in this week's Spy Talk in the Washington Post.
[00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:58.147]  Last week's Spy Talk, written by former spy Jeff Stein, they had the CIA by name admitting fake Bin Laden videos.
[00:55:58.147 --> 00:56:01.728]  Well this week, former Mossad agent ridicules Gaza ship raid
[00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:07.113]  Calls the flotilla raid so stupid it's stupefying.
[00:56:07.113 --> 00:56:10.196]  And he said exactly what I said yesterday.
[00:56:10.196 --> 00:56:12.177]  Only because I read a lot about naval warfare.
[00:56:12.177 --> 00:56:14.499]  This is interesting.
[00:56:14.499 --> 00:56:25.849]  You send up an open water wet sub, and they can go 30 miles an hour, they got a little pod that pops off, and you just simply blow or cut the propellers.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:33.102]  They even got special metal ropes, nets they can just throw into them.
[00:56:33.102 --> 00:56:34.643]  No, didn't do that.
[00:56:34.643 --> 00:56:40.766]  No, boarded the vessels in international waters.
[00:56:40.766 --> 00:56:43.508]  And he says, why didn't they wait until they got to Israel?
[00:56:43.508 --> 00:56:46.830]  And he said it's because Benjamin Netanyahu doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:56:47.796 --> 00:56:51.757]  But we're not going to listen to Victor Ostrovsky, who by the way we've had on the show before.
[00:56:51.757 --> 00:56:52.658]  I'm going to get him back on.
[00:56:52.658 --> 00:56:54.658]  He was on about five years ago.
[00:56:54.658 --> 00:56:55.739]  Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:55.739 --> 00:56:57.359]  He won't be listened to.
[00:56:57.359 --> 00:57:01.701]  Benjamin Netanyahu, he has to be listened to on everything because he knows everything.
[00:57:01.701 --> 00:57:04.242]  Former Mossad agent again ridicules Gaza's ship raid.
[00:57:04.242 --> 00:57:05.802]  You can read that.
[00:57:05.802 --> 00:57:07.883]  We'll cover more of that coming up later.
[00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:15.786]  But either way you slice it, this causes more of a global crisis and it's got all the Arab states up on a big uproar.
[00:57:17.827 --> 00:57:18.007]  I think?
[00:57:36.024 --> 00:57:37.325]  Refusals.
[00:57:37.325 --> 00:57:41.067]  Iran to dump 45 billion euros from gold bullion and dollars.
[00:57:41.067 --> 00:57:43.949]  So they're going to buy gold bullion from dumping dollars.
[00:57:43.949 --> 00:57:46.131]  That's PrisonPlanet.com reported by Press TV.
[00:57:46.131 --> 00:57:47.011]  Very important.
[00:57:47.011 --> 00:57:48.852]  That's directly from the Iranian government.
[00:57:48.852 --> 00:57:50.253]  That Press TV report that we link to.
[00:57:50.253 --> 00:57:50.433]  Also,
[00:57:54.807 --> 00:57:58.490]  Continuing here with the world news.
[00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:00.071]  BP oil leak.
[00:58:00.071 --> 00:58:04.015]  May last until Christmas, Obama says.
[00:58:04.015 --> 00:58:06.157]  That's Bloomberg.
[00:58:06.157 --> 00:58:07.157]  Palm Beach Post.
[00:58:07.157 --> 00:58:10.680]  Oil could hit Florida panhandle by today.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.742]  Devastating during the summer.
[00:58:12.742 --> 00:58:18.467]  Dying dead marine wildlife paint dark morbid picture of Gulf Coast following oil spill.
[00:58:19.708 --> 00:58:23.630]  Meanwhile, the Scientific American asked the proper question, where are the microbes?
[00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:32.495]  They should have been dumping microbes into that oil that eats oil immediately, but other scientists point out, hey, those microbes are already naturally in the ocean.
[00:58:32.495 --> 00:58:35.856]  In six months, almost all this oil will be gone.
[00:58:35.856 --> 00:58:42.760]  Crude oil is not very toxic compared to the chemicals they're using to disperse it.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.361]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.361 --> 00:58:48.583]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.489 --> 00:58:51.790]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:57.373]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:57.373 --> 00:59:02.395]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:02.395 --> 00:59:07.438]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:07.978 --> 00:59:13.202]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:13.202 --> 00:59:15.503]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:15.503 --> 00:59:20.306]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:20.306 --> 00:59:21.427]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:21.427 --> 00:59:24.489]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:24.489 --> 00:59:28.132]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:28.132 --> 00:59:31.314]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:31.314 --> 00:59:33.535]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:33.535 --> 00:59:34.456]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:38.098 --> 00:59:41.060]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:47.165]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:47.165 --> 00:59:53.690]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.092]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.092 --> 01:00:05.499]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:06.100]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:08.552]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.552 --> 01:00:10.313]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.313 --> 01:00:11.915]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.915 --> 01:00:13.456]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.456 --> 01:00:17.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:21.743]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:45.278]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we've got reporters from Bilderberg Group joining us, coming up in the last hour today.
[01:00:45.278 --> 01:00:47.760]  London Guardian reporter, Mr. Skelton.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:01:00.569]  We've also got Tucker and others joining us on the show, on the transmission tomorrow from Bilderberg in Spain, getting key intel on the year ahead as the world government body sets the agenda.
[01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:03.892]  But I tell you, what a hot-button issue.
[01:01:03.892 --> 01:01:04.773]  I mean, we have gotten
[01:01:06.698 --> 01:01:28.477]  Hundreds of calls off air hundreds and hundreds of emails on both sides, you know saying you aren't excoriating Israel enough and it's about 50-50 and you're not You know defending Israel enough And very few in the middle saying I think you're just giving you a balanced reporting and we had Mike Rivera on I think it's a really smart guy and
[01:01:29.372 --> 01:01:32.175]  And I agree with him on probably 95% of what he covers.
[01:01:32.175 --> 01:01:35.338]  I didn't agree with him when he started trying to link Israel.
[01:01:35.338 --> 01:01:40.523]  But I understand he thinks they want to start a war overall as a smokescreen with
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.362]  You know, with the whole North Korea situation.
[01:01:45.362 --> 01:01:50.185]  But, I mean, that was quite an interview yesterday, and we appreciate Mike coming on the show.
[01:01:50.185 --> 01:02:01.253]  And then I was talking, because I've been discussing with one of the station owners, he has me on two stations out there, MZ does, out in Santa Cruz, going into San Francisco, going out there next year.
[01:02:01.253 --> 01:02:06.717]  I don't go to a lot of stations to give speeches, but he's been asking me a lot, and he's done a lot, helping me get in Radio Inc.
[01:02:06.717 --> 01:02:09.338]  and things, so I've talked about, you know, going out there.
[01:02:10.379 --> 01:02:25.329]  Nailing that down for maybe September or October and he said my gosh We got hundreds of phone calls both pro and con and he goes that's what I like He said it's really stirred things up here on the radio station and I said and I said, yeah We're trying to get somebody on
[01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:52.799]  uh... with you know the pro-israel views i like to show both sides plus it's good talk radio and i said do you know anybody and uh... he said yeah doctor korey gold and i said wait a minute didn't i fill in one day you know as a guest host with you when he was out of town a few weeks ago he goes yeah that's the show and i said oh i've heard clips of that before on the web that's a pretty you know well-spoken fellow let's have him on and so uh... he is here on the broadcast and you know i've learned with israel
[01:02:53.439 --> 01:02:58.463]  And we're going to come back from break, because some stations don't carry this segment, and go straight to him.
[01:02:58.463 --> 01:03:09.111]  I've learned with the Israel situation, there is no black or white, there is no lukewarm, there is no, it's what side you choose.
[01:03:10.492 --> 01:03:15.315]  And those that hate Israel, they, to them, that's, you know, they're on the white side.
[01:03:15.315 --> 01:03:19.599]  And to those that love Israel, they're on the white side, wearing the white hats.
[01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:21.420]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.781]  And you're not going to convince anybody.
[01:03:23.781 --> 01:03:28.585]  I have noticed the people that hate Israel, it's a religion.
[01:03:28.585 --> 01:03:29.866]  Just like supporting Israel is
[01:03:31.946 --> 01:03:32.907]  Religious, almost.
[01:03:32.907 --> 01:03:34.888]  Well, it's based on a religion, I guess, at its core.
[01:03:34.888 --> 01:03:36.769]  So it is religious.
[01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:40.812]  And the people that hate Israel will make up all sorts of stuff.
[01:03:40.812 --> 01:03:48.757]  Just because I haven't viciously attacked Israel and have been neutral on it over the years, kind of like Switzerland, I have had every lie under the sun made up about me.
[01:03:48.757 --> 01:03:53.981]  So it makes you automatically disrespect the people that constantly attack Israel.
[01:03:53.981 --> 01:03:58.044]  Because I found that, by and large, they are a bunch of manufacturers and liars.
[01:03:59.056 --> 01:04:05.938]  I mean, I've never experienced the death threats, the lies, the distortions, the... about me!
[01:04:05.938 --> 01:04:07.698]  I mean, they just make up endless things.
[01:04:07.698 --> 01:04:08.999]  We're owned by ABC.
[01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:10.039]  Totally untrue.
[01:04:10.039 --> 01:04:11.460]  No connection to ABC.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:16.581]  I guess five years ago, we leased a satellite, as anybody does on talk radio, you know, one feet of thousands.
[01:04:16.581 --> 01:04:22.303]  If you start a show about pets, you've got to go lease one of three satellites, but they're out of it now.
[01:04:22.303 --> 01:04:26.864]  And they made lies about... or they claim I'm owned by Saudi Arabian companies, or... just, just, just...
[01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:29.991]  Lies is the name of the game.
[01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:34.033]  But separately, I've found pro-Israel groups will lie and distort.
[01:04:34.033 --> 01:04:41.216]  I've had the ADL distort and lie about us and say I'm a liar and there's no such thing as a world government.
[01:04:41.216 --> 01:04:44.197]  And so, I'm really sick of it.
[01:04:44.197 --> 01:04:44.718]  And you know what?
[01:04:44.718 --> 01:04:49.140]  I think Israel was out of line doing this in international waters.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.281]  I think Israel gave themselves a black eye.
[01:04:52.628 --> 01:04:55.517]  But that doesn't mean I hate Israel.
[01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:57.181]  And so I get both sides attacking me.
[01:04:57.181 --> 01:04:59.147]  We'll talk to Dr. Corey Gold on the other side.
[01:05:02.435 --> 01:05:06.396]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.396 --> 01:05:15.259]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.259 --> 01:05:19.880]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:30.703]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.323 --> 01:05:40.845]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.845 --> 01:05:46.267]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.267 --> 01:05:53.768]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.768 --> 01:05:56.509]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:00.359 --> 01:06:04.542]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:06:04.542 --> 01:06:10.967]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:18.353]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:06:18.353 --> 01:06:23.216]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:06:23.216 --> 01:06:25.358]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.902]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:06:31.902 --> 01:06:34.203]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:06:34.203 --> 01:06:34.523]  Call us!
[01:06:47.649 --> 01:06:47.789]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[01:06:52.334 --> 01:06:52.674]  Thank you.
[01:06:52.674 --> 01:06:54.956]  You may be arrested and or subject to...
[01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:05.482]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:05.482 --> 01:07:09.146]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.146 --> 01:07:11.648]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:11.648 --> 01:07:17.513]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:17.513 --> 01:07:23.779]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:24.179 --> 01:07:30.164]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:30.164 --> 01:07:34.327]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.327 --> 01:07:38.631]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:38.631 --> 01:07:44.576]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:44.576 --> 01:07:48.139]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:48.139 --> 01:07:50.120]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:50.541]  It's here.

[01:08:01.106 --> 01:08:06.508]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.508 --> 01:08:08.790]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:29.781]  All right, coming up in the next hour, it's probably been eight, nine years since I had him on, Dr. John Coleman will be joining us to talk about the Committee of 300, a key globalist focus group, a nexus organization between the Trilateral Commission, CFR, and Bilderberg Group.
[01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:32.443]  His evidence is even more powerful than the 150-member Bilderberg.
[01:08:34.605 --> 01:08:34.865]  I don't know.
[01:08:51.643 --> 01:09:03.591]  Uh, and he is a dentist turned entrepreneur who started and sold many businesses and who currently owns a growing online-based training business for medical doctors and dentists, uh, for their consulting, uh, and education licensing requirements.
[01:09:03.591 --> 01:09:13.858]  He's also a popular primetime talk show host on KSCO News Talk AM 1080 and the Monterey Salinas Santa Cruz, which is also an affiliate of
[01:09:14.844 --> 01:09:17.025]  The Alex Jones Radio Show!
[01:09:17.025 --> 01:09:19.146]  And we're actually on two stations there in the area.
[01:09:19.146 --> 01:09:22.067]  They have us on live up against Limbaugh on the smaller station.
[01:09:22.067 --> 01:09:28.350]  And they re-air me at night on the big mega station that goes into San Francisco and other big cities.
[01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:31.891]  And it's the top station there in town on talk radio.
[01:09:31.891 --> 01:09:33.752]  It's got Limbaugh and George Dorian and all those folks.
[01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.353]  And we're very appreciative of that affiliate.
[01:09:36.353 --> 01:09:41.936]  And I was looking around yesterday for somebody to come on to give a pro-Israel view.
[01:09:43.036 --> 01:09:48.280]  And Dr. Corey Gold certainly has that perspective.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:54.205]  Because one thing I don't want to do here is just be on one side or the other.
[01:09:54.205 --> 01:10:02.472]  Especially on issues where it's an ancient feud and both sides, I believe, have perspective and points.
[01:10:02.472 --> 01:10:04.093]  And then there's propaganda on both sides.
[01:10:04.093 --> 01:10:09.658]  But we'll get his take on the boarding of the flotilla two days ago.
[01:10:09.658 --> 01:10:11.179]  So Dr. Gold, good to have you on with us.
[01:10:11.579 --> 01:10:13.019]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[01:10:13.019 --> 01:10:14.020]  So much going on.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:14.960]  Well, you've got the floor.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:23.263]  I heard it was hot discussion yesterday when I went off the air on your show, so give us your rundown on what you think's really going on.
[01:10:23.263 --> 01:10:31.425]  Well, Alex, you're making my job easy because you are on one of our sister stations right before I go on the air, opposite Rush Limbaugh in our community.
[01:10:31.425 --> 01:10:33.006]  We run both stations.
[01:10:33.006 --> 01:10:37.727]  And by the way, I'm one of your, listen to you every day, love your show, and we probably share
[01:10:37.987 --> 01:10:43.150]  I don't know, 90% the same philosophy, and that's what makes listening to your show every morning great.
[01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:49.434]  I'm listening yesterday and I hear Mike Rivero on, and I'm going, am I really hearing this on the show?
[01:10:49.434 --> 01:10:56.818]  Because, you know, before the ink has dried on this incident, before people even know what facts are in play, judgments are already being passed.
[01:10:56.818 --> 01:11:03.342]  And we hear this every day on other issues, like what happened with the plane going to the IRS building, what happened with militias.
[01:11:03.602 --> 01:11:08.289]  What's going on with tea parties where people are making judgment calls on things before people know facts?
[01:11:08.289 --> 01:11:11.012]  And I hear a guy doing that yesterday.
[01:11:12.127 --> 01:11:15.269]  Well, maybe you should get Mike Ongs, he's a pretty nice fella.
[01:11:15.269 --> 01:11:16.850]  Maybe you should get him on your show.
[01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:18.231]  I'd be happy to.
[01:11:18.231 --> 01:11:20.633]  And then you can go on his program.
[01:11:20.633 --> 01:11:24.636]  But one of the things I want to say about this thing is what's happening in the Middle East is not a cartoon.
[01:11:24.636 --> 01:11:28.378]  It's not like this black and white, there's one right group, there's one wrong group.
[01:11:28.378 --> 01:11:31.620]  It's this very simple, non-complex situation.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:38.665]  It is so multi-layered and so complex that even the people who study it have trouble keeping up with the players.
[01:11:38.665 --> 01:11:40.186]  Well, let me be clear from what I was saying earlier.
[01:11:40.186 --> 01:11:40.967]  When I said it's not
[01:11:41.827 --> 01:11:49.535]  What's interesting is within Israel itself, there's a large movement of people who actually disagree with the government and would like to do almost anything they could do to create peace.
[01:11:59.705 --> 01:12:08.468]  And those people have been in government for a long period of time and have actually tried quite hard to create peace with the Palestinians and create a Palestinian homeland.
[01:12:08.468 --> 01:12:15.371]  It's really difficult when you have a bunch of players like Hamas, Hezbollah, and others like Syria and agitators like Iran.
[01:12:15.371 --> 01:12:16.171]  It's complex.
[01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:18.612]  Who do you create peace with and how do you create peace at all?
[01:12:19.472 --> 01:12:29.318]  And, you know, the whole concept of negotiating with somebody who says, where a charter says, we want to destroy you and let's try to create a peace treaty with them is a complex situation.
[01:12:29.318 --> 01:12:37.463]  I will agree with you, that was a PR disaster, what happened a couple days ago out off the coast of Israel and the coast of Gaza.
[01:12:37.463 --> 01:12:41.186]  But I think it was a PR disaster that was totally set up and they walked into it.
[01:12:42.086 --> 01:12:57.495]  I think when Turkey, when those boats left Turkey, and they had the cameras on by Al Jazeera, and it was pre-announced, here we come, stop us if you can, we're going to break your blockade, and the Israelis were provoked to block the blockade.
[01:12:57.495 --> 01:13:03.038]  And the whole thing was filmed, we saw some from Al Jazeera, we're just starting to see some from IVF footage.
[01:13:03.818 --> 01:13:10.243]  And what we're seeing is that there was scuffles on the boats and it was not a black and white situation of what to happen.
[01:13:10.243 --> 01:13:12.324]  I can tell you it was a PR disaster.
[01:13:12.324 --> 01:13:17.208]  And Israel will take a big hit because of how the world will perceive what happened.
[01:13:17.208 --> 01:13:19.770]  But it's not simple to what's happening in Gaza.
[01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:24.113]  One thing I'll tell you is the people who are living in Gaza are human pawns.
[01:13:24.113 --> 01:13:28.276]  They're being used by Hamas and Hezbollah and many other people
[01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:31.258]  As fodder to keep this going.
[01:13:31.258 --> 01:13:38.005]  Sure, why doesn't Egypt, who's got a giant population, just let the million and a half Gazans come in there?
[01:13:38.005 --> 01:13:44.991]  And by the way, there's been discussions about letting Jordan take over the West Bank, you know, but that's not something they even want to have.
[01:13:44.991 --> 01:13:49.836]  There's been discussions about Egypt taking over Gaza and letting them self-rule themselves, but it's not something they want.
[01:13:49.836 --> 01:13:53.219]  And that's because the Palestinians have a history of trying to overthrow governments they're in.
[01:13:53.799 --> 01:13:54.540]  You're right!
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:14:05.250]  So there's this complex situation going on where no one wants to accept anybody else's solution, and I don't know if it'll ever get solved, but it's not a black and white situation going on there.
[01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:10.875]  And Israel has taken stances right now, just like in other places where you swing too far left.
[01:14:11.536 --> 01:14:15.120]  You know, Israel was very far left before and was ready to give almost everything away.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:24.972]  It was turned down, so the reaction by the Israeli people was, hey, if we want to give you everything and you turn it down, we're going to try the other stance, which is Netanyahu, which is a very stiff boot.
[01:14:24.972 --> 01:14:29.237]  My guess is he'll be out soon and another left-wing government will come in.
[01:14:29.237 --> 01:14:30.258]  It's one of these things where
[01:14:30.859 --> 01:14:34.382]  When you offer somebody what they're asking and they don't take it, where do you go from there?
[01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:36.384]  So it's a complex situation.
[01:14:36.384 --> 01:14:38.786]  What's happening out in Gaza is tragic.
[01:14:38.786 --> 01:14:43.130]  What's happening to those people there is absolutely tragic.
[01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:50.117]  And part of it is Israel, part of it is the leadership in Hamas and Hezbollah, part of it is the rest of the world just letting it go on.
[01:14:51.031 --> 01:15:00.018]  And, uh, you know, Israel has taken a stance that they have said the following, we are not letting ships come in because we are afraid that those ships will contain weapons.
[01:15:00.018 --> 01:15:05.122]  We want to board and we want to check ships before they come in, and that is how we're going to play this game.
[01:15:05.122 --> 01:15:07.204]  The other ships coming there know exactly this.
[01:15:07.924 --> 01:15:15.471]  And when they decide they want to break it, they're intentionally doing it, knowing that the Israelis will interact with them, and they come with cameras on board.
[01:15:15.471 --> 01:15:19.134]  But wait, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but I've done the research.
[01:15:19.134 --> 01:15:24.039]  Doesn't Israel turn back almost all the boats, even if they try to stop for inspection?
[01:15:24.039 --> 01:15:25.039]  They let through some.
[01:15:25.039 --> 01:15:30.324]  Others they'll port in Israel, and then they'll take the materials into Gaza once they've had a chance to inspect them.
[01:15:30.324 --> 01:15:33.187]  But part of it is... But then the corrupt authorities keep it for themselves.
[01:15:34.145 --> 01:15:36.247]  You mean corrupt authorities where?
[01:15:36.247 --> 01:15:37.108]  In Gaza.
[01:15:37.108 --> 01:15:38.209]  You're right!
[01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:42.492]  It's like when we send aid to Pakistan, and we expect the aid to get to the right people.
[01:15:42.492 --> 01:15:45.675]  We know that, at least I believe, that most of it goes to the wrong people.
[01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:57.005]  You know, when we send money into Afghanistan to work with some of the people there, it's supposed to go to the people who, you know, need the food and stuff, and yet the reaction is, by me, is like it's all going to go to the wrong people.
[01:15:57.005 --> 01:15:57.765]  You're right.
[01:15:57.765 --> 01:16:02.049]  When it goes into Gaza, the people who are in charge of Gaza do what they want with it.
[01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:07.011]  And, you know, it's one of those situations where those people are human fodder.
[01:16:07.011 --> 01:16:12.193]  They are being used to create world sympathy because they are in a tragic situation.
[01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:16.815]  Yet the people who run their organization don't really have incentive to close it because...
[01:16:17.675 --> 01:16:18.716]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:16:18.716 --> 01:16:33.003]  It is a fact that, especially Saddam Hussein and others, and I was against that war, by the way, but they admitted that they all use basically the Palestinian thing as a political distraction, kind of like gay marriage.
[01:16:33.003 --> 01:16:35.424]  And I'm not saying I'm for gay marriage, folks.
[01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:41.687]  I'm saying it's used as a political football to distract from larger issues that go on.
[01:16:41.687 --> 01:16:42.947]  And it's basically the same thing.
[01:16:42.947 --> 01:16:43.788]  All the Arab states
[01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:51.153]  Love to point at Israel and make statements because it becomes a convenient political distraction.
[01:16:51.153 --> 01:16:58.716]  Regardless of where you stand in Israel, you know, the Arab states are extremely, extremely corrupt.
[01:16:58.716 --> 01:17:11.281]  And I never really hear these aid groups talking about all the oppression going on in Saudi Arabia or the oppression of Christians and other groups going on in Egypt or what's happening.
[01:17:11.281 --> 01:17:12.702]  It's the cause celeb
[01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:14.490]  Yes.
[01:17:30.905 --> 01:17:32.728]  You know, I agree with you on that.
[01:17:32.728 --> 01:17:44.726]  You know, one of the things that I get on my show a lot, particularly about you, and I'm going to ask you a question straight out and let you answer it without interruption, is people get this belief system that
[01:17:45.763 --> 01:17:51.267]  Your use of the word Zionism at times has a different meaning than most people have for Zionism.
[01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:55.650]  And the reason I'm asking this question is not to make you look bad or to put you in a funny position.
[01:17:55.650 --> 01:18:01.113]  I think if you actually told people what you thought Zionism was, because sometimes you say Zionist people do this or Zionist people do that.
[01:18:02.354 --> 01:18:03.655]  What how do you view that word?
[01:18:03.655 --> 01:18:04.675]  What does it mean to you?
[01:18:04.675 --> 01:18:08.316]  Well, see that's another problem All this is so complex.
[01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:14.558]  Well, there's three or four even more different variants of Zionist There's Christian Zionist.
[01:18:14.558 --> 01:18:16.138]  There's left-wing Jewish Zionist.
[01:18:16.138 --> 01:18:28.402]  There's right-wing Jewish Zionist There's globalist Zionist who say they're Zionist, but then basically support the whole world government I mean, I know I mean that's an endless discussion, right?
[01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:38.228]  Well, the reason I say that is because the vast majority of people who listen to your show, and a lot of them are Jewish and are big supporters of what you say, because most of it's dead on.
[01:18:38.228 --> 01:18:44.872]  When they think of Zionism, they think of somebody who just believes in the right for Israel to exist, and that's where it begins and ends to them.
[01:18:44.872 --> 01:18:51.836]  You can be a conservative Zionist, you can be a liberal Zionist, you can be a rich Zionist, a poor Zionist, a black Zionist, a white Zionist.
[01:18:51.836 --> 01:18:53.256]  It's not really any of the above.
[01:18:53.256 --> 01:18:55.558]  It's simply the belief system and the right of Israel to exist.
[01:18:56.238 --> 01:19:09.735]  So when that term gets used in other things, they're saying, wait a second, so people believe in the right of Israel to exist are doing these things, and that's where sometimes people get a little bit agitated at you because they see that word differently than maybe you're using it.
[01:19:09.735 --> 01:19:11.357]  Well, this is how I really see it.
[01:19:11.357 --> 01:19:12.799]  Like any political group,
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:30.964]  They basically have their supporters who mean well and then you've got the inner group and again there's multiple groups within Zionism from my research who are manipulating and controlling through the tribal war-like culture which everybody has built into them.
[01:19:30.964 --> 01:19:40.846]  They're controlling those groups and then they have a separate agenda from what they're actually telling their followers and supporters.
[01:19:40.846 --> 01:19:41.986]  So when I'm talking about
[01:19:43.598 --> 01:19:44.618]  Again, that's the problem.
[01:19:44.618 --> 01:19:50.161]  I mean, how do you even define what a... Well, you know what?
[01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:53.202]  Let's come back, because there's the break, and I'll try to elaborate on it.
[01:19:53.202 --> 01:19:56.383]  I didn't know I was going to be asked that question, because it's just such a deep question.
[01:19:56.383 --> 01:19:57.664]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:19:57.664 --> 01:19:58.644]  Stay with us.

[01:21:07.707 --> 01:21:09.968]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:21:09.968 --> 01:21:15.131]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:21:15.131 --> 01:21:16.952]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:21:16.952 --> 01:21:18.273]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:21:18.493 --> 01:21:19.974]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:21:19.974 --> 01:21:23.357]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:21:23.357 --> 01:21:28.722]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:21:28.722 --> 01:21:37.830]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:21:38.050 --> 01:21:43.232]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:46.713]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[01:21:46.713 --> 01:21:53.276]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:56.577]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[01:21:56.577 --> 01:21:56.857]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.543 --> 01:22:05.164]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[01:22:05.164 --> 01:22:12.946]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[01:22:12.946 --> 01:22:27.750]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[01:22:44.515 --> 01:22:46.216]  Just call the Berkey Guy at 1-877-886-3653 now to order.

[01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.771]  The problem.
[01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:04.353]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:23:04.353 --> 01:23:07.056]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:23:07.056 --> 01:23:09.738]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:23:09.738 --> 01:23:12.241]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:23:12.241 --> 01:23:21.249]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[01:23:21.249 --> 01:23:22.991]  KaroStove has been in business for over
[01:23:23.191 --> 01:23:23.471]  I think so.
[01:23:38.385 --> 01:23:41.327]  Call 888-395-1164 today.
[01:23:41.327 --> 01:23:50.453]  That's 888-395-1164 and ask about weekly specials or check the specials online each week at kerostove.com.
[01:23:50.453 --> 01:23:55.876]  Again, call 888-395-1164 or go to kerostove.com.
[01:23:55.876 --> 01:23:58.978]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[01:24:18.422 --> 01:24:22.083]  All right, Dr. Corey Gould's our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:42.248]  And talking to him and having him clarify exactly what the question is, when I have guests on that are criticizing, quote, Zionists, the general public that's scared of what Israel's doing with its nuclear weapons and the rest of it, and particularly the Likudniks, the pro-war crowd,
[01:24:44.178 --> 01:24:48.842]  They think of a modern Zionist as someone lobbying the U.S.
[01:24:48.842 --> 01:24:55.148]  government to attack more Middle Eastern countries that could cause World War III.
[01:24:55.148 --> 01:24:59.732]  And they think of Israel as basically how they think of the CIA.
[01:24:59.732 --> 01:25:02.935]  You know, people running Israel.
[01:25:02.935 --> 01:25:04.797]  I'm against what the CIA does.
[01:25:04.797 --> 01:25:06.819]  That is the leadership of it growing opium.
[01:25:07.964 --> 01:25:13.210]  But when I have Ray McGovern on, who was a chief analyst for the CIA, he's a good guy.
[01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:14.491]  Or when I have somebody else on.
[01:25:14.491 --> 01:25:19.096]  So, again, all these big organizations or groups are very diverse.
[01:25:19.096 --> 01:25:22.439]  And I know that all the different factions like to oversimplify it.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:35.363]  And, you know, even if you dress up in a Nazi outfit and wear a Hitler mustache and, you know, say, kill all Jews, the anti-Semitic groups will hate you because they all hate each other more than any other group.
[01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:47.426]  So I certainly don't ever want to be associated with them, and I don't want to be associated with the worship, you know, pro-war Christian Zionists who literally want to cause World War III and make Jesus come back.
[01:25:47.426 --> 01:25:48.166]  I mean, I've seen it.
[01:25:49.126 --> 01:25:49.826]  I'm a Christian.
[01:25:49.826 --> 01:25:51.767]  These people are dangerous.
[01:25:51.767 --> 01:26:00.111]  And I don't know if Zionist Jews, that is Jews that believe Israel has a right to exist, and I don't think they're bad people.
[01:26:00.111 --> 01:26:01.331]  No, certainly not.
[01:26:01.331 --> 01:26:08.314]  I don't think they realize just how, and I'm not scapegoating Christian Zionists, that's a diverse spectrum of people as well.
[01:26:08.314 --> 01:26:11.776]  You know, they'll call in and say, look, I'm a Christian who thinks Israel has a right to exist.
[01:26:11.776 --> 01:26:12.296]  Well, fine.
[01:26:12.776 --> 01:26:19.077]  But are you the group saying we've got to get all Jews back to Israel so Jesus will come back, so World War III can happen?
[01:26:19.077 --> 01:26:22.378]  Mr. Gold, Dr. Gold, I mean, are you aware of that group of Zionists?
[01:26:22.378 --> 01:26:24.358]  They call my shows... Well, no.
[01:26:24.358 --> 01:26:26.859]  Christian Zionists, that's a whole other thing.
[01:26:26.859 --> 01:26:35.841]  But when a Jewish person hears the word Zionist, they simply think of historically, over the last 140 years, since Theodore Herzl, about the concept of having a place like Israel where Jews could go.
[01:26:36.181 --> 01:26:40.286]  It was before World War I. It was before the Holocaust and World War II.
[01:26:40.286 --> 01:26:44.791]  It was simply an outgrowth of that belief system of returning to the homeland of the Jews.
[01:26:44.791 --> 01:26:51.779]  And so, when people hear that word who are Jewish, when they think of the word Zionist, like my... I know friends of mine who are the most...
[01:26:52.159 --> 01:26:56.963]  Progressive liberal people on the planet who we can't agree on anything, but they call themselves Zionists.
[01:26:56.963 --> 01:27:03.347]  And I myself would be pretty much a conservative or an open independent individual, and I'm a Zionist because I believe in Israel's right to exist.
[01:27:03.347 --> 01:27:04.988]  I believe in Mexico's right to exist.
[01:27:04.988 --> 01:27:06.410]  I believe in Canada's right to exist.
[01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:10.973]  So that's how they kind of see that definition of what a Zionist is.
[01:27:10.973 --> 01:27:13.876]  They don't attribute everything else to it.
[01:27:13.876 --> 01:27:21.923]  And Jewish people obviously don't ascribe to the belief system that we should have World War III to bring back the Jesus rebirth and have all the Jews die in Israel.
[01:27:21.923 --> 01:27:26.166]  That would not be something that anybody who's a Jewish person would consider to be a good idea.
[01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:28.689]  So I don't see that as... But you are familiar with that strain.
[01:27:29.829 --> 01:27:39.716]  I have people call my show on a regular basis going over that, that they believe that the reason they support Israel is so that Israel can ultimately be destroyed, so that the Messiah can come.
[01:27:39.716 --> 01:27:42.458]  Obviously, my opinion is the Messiah wants to come.
[01:27:42.458 --> 01:27:45.180]  He doesn't need me to kill a bunch of people to have him come.
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.040]  He can come on his own.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.262]  He's got his own, you know, abilities to do those things.
[01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:51.184]  He doesn't need me to pick up a gun and shoot somebody to have him come.
[01:27:51.184 --> 01:27:53.565]  So, that wouldn't be something I ascribe to.
[01:27:53.565 --> 01:27:57.388]  On my show, and I have days where I simply say, why do you hate Tuesday?
[01:27:57.648 --> 01:28:05.218]  And you'll have amazing phone callers who call in and tell you bizarre, almost psychotic reasons why they think that you're the best.
[01:28:05.218 --> 01:28:07.261]  Yeah, but you don't want to... You want to do that here?
[01:28:07.261 --> 01:28:08.402]  Oh, I don't want to do that here.
[01:28:08.402 --> 01:28:08.963]  I mean, you can.
[01:28:08.963 --> 01:28:09.704]  I don't care.
[01:28:09.704 --> 01:28:13.208]  But the reality is, is when you hear those people speak, you realize how stupid it is.
[01:28:13.689 --> 01:28:15.450]  Well, here's what I'm saying.
[01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:20.592]  I feel like it's a diversion and a distraction, and I want people to live in peace over there.
[01:28:20.592 --> 01:28:23.173]  And certainly, you know, Jewish people have a right to a homeland.
[01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:24.574]  It is a tiny country.
[01:28:24.574 --> 01:28:30.196]  There are some problems with how Israel came to be and, you know, the forcing out of the Muslims and the Palestinians.
[01:28:30.196 --> 01:28:32.277]  So, I mean, there's a big issue there.
[01:28:32.517 --> 01:28:33.839]  But the question is, who forced them out?
[01:28:33.839 --> 01:28:39.566]  And another thing, you can go back, look at the map from a hundred years ago and try to find the same countries on it today.
[01:28:39.566 --> 01:28:41.208]  The map keeps on changing around the globe.
[01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:47.557]  No, no, I understand that and I understand the United States was carved out of taking land from Spain and from France and from the Native Americans.
[01:28:47.557 --> 01:28:48.017]  Look, I'm not...
[01:28:48.678 --> 01:28:50.098]  I mean, I understand history is history.
[01:28:50.098 --> 01:28:57.000]  I mean, I'm a fan of Andrew Jackson, and people say, well, that guy, you know, took a bunch of Indian land.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:09.703]  Overall, though, you know, I mean, the natives were all fighting with each other and different factions and begging, because I've actually studied the history, you know, to get settlers to help them go displace their enemy.
[01:29:09.703 --> 01:29:12.604]  So I understand it's not cut and dry.
[01:29:12.604 --> 01:29:13.684]  I've actually studied history.
[01:29:14.344 --> 01:29:17.666]  My frustration is I'm sick of talking about Israel.
[01:29:17.666 --> 01:29:19.506]  I want to defend my republic.
[01:29:19.506 --> 01:29:20.947]  I want lower taxes.
[01:29:20.947 --> 01:29:22.448]  I want to be able to raise my children.
[01:29:22.448 --> 01:29:23.908]  I want a free press.
[01:29:23.908 --> 01:29:29.471]  And I'm just tired of how it's a political football on all different sides.
[01:29:29.471 --> 01:29:31.932]  And I'm just sick of hearing about Israel.
[01:29:31.932 --> 01:29:34.213]  But let's come back and get your take on that.
[01:29:34.213 --> 01:29:34.673]  You know what?
[01:29:34.673 --> 01:29:36.134]  You broached the idea.
[01:29:37.174 --> 01:29:43.556]  And so we'll do it, as long as people can be civil, why they love Israel or why you hate Israel.
[01:29:43.556 --> 01:29:43.976]  Okay?
[01:29:43.976 --> 01:29:44.736]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:44.736 --> 01:29:45.776]  We'll be back.
[01:29:45.776 --> 01:29:46.836]  We're on the march.
[01:29:46.836 --> 01:29:48.377]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.377 --> 01:29:49.797]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:07.684]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.684 --> 01:30:12.826]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:12.826 --> 01:30:21.549]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:25.611]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:03.786]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.786 --> 01:32:09.113]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.113 --> 01:32:11.176]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.176 --> 01:32:16.182]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.182 --> 01:32:17.364]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.364 --> 01:32:18.085]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.465 --> 01:32:20.347]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.347 --> 01:32:21.428]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.428 --> 01:32:23.629]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:24.971]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:24.971 --> 01:32:26.492]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.492 --> 01:32:31.756]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:34.899]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.339 --> 01:32:39.163]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.163 --> 01:32:40.384]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.384 --> 01:32:41.284]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.284 --> 01:32:42.405]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.405 --> 01:32:43.326]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.326 --> 01:32:44.427]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.427 --> 01:32:47.470]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:49.252]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.252 --> 01:32:50.172]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:11.616 --> 01:33:13.378]  You know, I run into this all the time.
[01:33:13.378 --> 01:33:18.684]  I criticize open borders because we have a welfare system in this country.
[01:33:20.578 --> 01:33:22.820]  That is going bankrupt.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.121]  The states are going bankrupt.
[01:33:24.121 --> 01:33:25.963]  I don't have to go through the evidence of that.
[01:33:25.963 --> 01:33:26.463]  You know that.
[01:33:26.463 --> 01:33:28.104]  It's admitted on the news.
[01:33:28.104 --> 01:33:31.627]  More than 15 states have gone bankrupt or on the verge of going bankrupt.
[01:33:31.627 --> 01:33:34.870]  You've got 6.5 billion people that want to come here.
[01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:37.492]  There's 6.8.5, so I guess 6 billion, 850 million plus people.
[01:33:37.492 --> 01:33:39.274]  8 plus billion want to come here.
[01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:52.561]  And I was on a libertarian show last night, Free Talk Live, and they want to have a whole debate on their show and also my show about immigration.
[01:33:52.561 --> 01:33:54.981]  They said, well, we're total libertarians.
[01:33:54.981 --> 01:33:56.102]  You know, we want to get rid of the borders.
[01:33:56.102 --> 01:34:07.425]  And I said, oh yeah, get rid of the borders with Latin America that's completely collapsed and bring in a voting bloc that will vote to take our guns and will vote to take our private property.
[01:34:07.425 --> 01:34:08.245]  That's the fact.
[01:34:08.245 --> 01:34:09.346]  That's how those people vote.
[01:34:10.587 --> 01:34:23.812]  and uh... that will bankrupt the states because we have this welfare system if we didn't have a democratic party in liberation theology i had a caller yesterday and we're going back to our guest on that show who said what's wrong liberation theology
[01:34:24.548 --> 01:34:31.415]  Well, the Ford Foundation and the federal government for 50 years have taught people in Mexico and in all the public schools in the U.S.
[01:34:31.415 --> 01:34:35.059]  I was taught this in Rockwall and then in Austin.
[01:34:35.059 --> 01:34:36.540]  In Dallas and in Austin.
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:44.709]  No matter what class, where I went, then in college, that America stole Mexico, America's evil, America's gonna fall to Azadlan.
[01:34:46.377 --> 01:34:49.158]  The mythical southwest kingdom of the Aztecs.
[01:34:49.158 --> 01:34:54.679]  We have the video clip of the former Austin mayor saying that Hispanics are the god race.
[01:34:54.679 --> 01:34:58.800]  Look, I could care less if you got brown skin and are Hispanic.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.180]  Okay?
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:03.881]  I like senoritas and I like Mexican culture and I like enchiladas.
[01:35:03.881 --> 01:35:06.701]  I liked a vacation in Mexico that wasn't so dangerous.
[01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:14.203]  But Mexico is a collapsing society with 23 plus thousand deaths the last two years.
[01:35:15.283 --> 01:35:19.506]  And they want the North American Union to merge me into this?
[01:35:19.506 --> 01:35:22.648]  And the North American Union, SPP, is an undemocratic system?
[01:35:22.648 --> 01:35:28.972]  And the guy called in and said, I used to really love you, but I feel like you're Ann Coulter on steroids and that you don't like Hispanics.
[01:35:28.972 --> 01:35:30.994]  I could care less what color you are.
[01:35:30.994 --> 01:35:32.955]  It's how you behave.
[01:35:32.955 --> 01:35:34.756]  Are you a constitutionalist?
[01:35:34.756 --> 01:35:36.297]  Are you into the free market?
[01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:38.439]  Are you into a free society?
[01:35:38.439 --> 01:35:39.159]  I mean, come on.
[01:35:39.159 --> 01:35:43.582]  I mean, I mean, all these libertarians, the big global corporations want open borders.
[01:35:43.582 --> 01:35:44.563]  Why do you think that is?
[01:35:46.269 --> 01:36:05.439]  I mean, I ask this question, and why does the Israeli lobby, almost to a man, vote to take my guns and vote to open my borders up, and if the Muslims are basically blood-drinking vampires that want to rip my throat out, why are they always lobbying to bring unlimited immigration in?
[01:36:05.439 --> 01:36:06.740]  Why?
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:07.540]  Why?
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:11.162]  Why is the pro-Israel lobby in Europe lobbying for open borders?
[01:36:11.162 --> 01:36:12.843]  What is going on with that?
[01:36:12.843 --> 01:36:14.704]  Why does the pro-Israel lobby
[01:36:15.726 --> 01:36:24.718]  Schumer and Lieberman, the leaders of the open border and anti-gun movement, but they want Israel to have borders!
[01:36:25.782 --> 01:36:27.902]  They want Israel to have M-16s?
[01:36:27.902 --> 01:36:28.463]  So great!
[01:36:28.463 --> 01:36:30.943]  Have your walls and have your M-16s, Israel!
[01:36:30.943 --> 01:36:31.763]  We deserve M-16s!
[01:36:31.763 --> 01:36:34.304]  You know, that's my issue!
[01:36:34.304 --> 01:36:43.765]  And so going back to you and then calls with Dr. Corey Gold, who is an American Jew, saying he's a Zionist, meaning he believes in Israel as a right to exist.
[01:36:43.765 --> 01:36:44.385]  Okay.
[01:36:44.385 --> 01:36:48.806]  Well, I believe America has a right to exist, and I know his show.
[01:36:48.806 --> 01:36:50.687]  He's pro-Second Amendment, pro-border.
[01:36:50.687 --> 01:36:51.647]  That's great!
[01:36:51.647 --> 01:36:52.327]  I mean, how do you...
[01:36:53.499 --> 01:37:02.965]  Why do we see so much of the pro-Israel lobby, then at the same time, going along with Obama and others against our liberties here at home?
[01:37:02.965 --> 01:37:05.586]  Why is there that schizophrenia?
[01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:07.548]  It is a schizophrenia, and I don't understand it.
[01:37:07.548 --> 01:37:15.152]  As you said earlier, I'm pro-border control, I'm pro-what-they're-doing-in-Arizona, I'm for gun rights, and a lot of Jewish people are.
[01:37:15.152 --> 01:37:16.273]  We're not monolithic.
[01:37:16.273 --> 01:37:21.276]  Those individuals, I'm glad they're pro-Israel, but there are other stances I disagree with.
[01:37:21.596 --> 01:37:24.399]  So, you know, Jewish people are not monolithic.
[01:37:24.399 --> 01:37:25.981]  They can have very divergent point of views.
[01:37:25.981 --> 01:37:31.046]  Chuck Schumer and the way he's dealing with American sovereignty, I'm totally against what he's saying.
[01:37:31.046 --> 01:37:31.586]  Absolutely, 100%.
[01:37:31.586 --> 01:37:42.738]  Well, how do we get, then, wealthy, intelligent, well-educated Jewish communities to go elect Jews who are pro-Second Amendment, anti-New World Order?
[01:37:42.998 --> 01:38:01.842]  Because I'll guarantee you, all this anti, and of course we've been talking off air, no one denies it, this massive wave of anti-Israel, anti-Jew, because first it was, oh, we just don't like Zionists, is what the white supremacists say, and then next it's, no, it's Jews, and they put out a lot of propaganda in this info, but then it doesn't help Israel's case.
[01:38:02.162 --> 01:38:04.365]  When it's lobbyists here in the U.S.
[01:38:04.365 --> 01:38:06.367]  are going against so many of our freedoms.
[01:38:06.367 --> 01:38:17.459]  I'll guarantee you a lot of this anti-Israel stuff would disappear overnight if the Israeli lobby, and I know it's not one monolithic group, but predominantly, would stop going for the New World Order.
[01:38:18.203 --> 01:38:30.535]  Yeah, but, you know, people who are Zionists and people who are Jewish people cannot control what Chuck Schumer does, and they can't control what Joseph Lieberman, and they can't control what those individuals do.
[01:38:30.535 --> 01:38:35.801]  These individuals are doing their own thing for their own purposes and I don't understand what they are.
[01:38:36.161 --> 01:38:42.824]  I can't tell you what they are, because as a person who's for border control and for guns rights, I don't know, you know, why they would want to do what they're doing.
[01:38:42.824 --> 01:38:50.547]  And you're right, they do support Israel and have them have a right to exist, but on the other hand they do things that can be considered anti-American.
[01:38:50.547 --> 01:38:55.589]  So I think that's just their own selves, whether or not they have problems with America, whether they don't like
[01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.849]  I don't know.
[01:39:08.939 --> 01:39:10.340]  Well, that's my only issue.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:21.549]  And I guarantee you, if Jewish folks in America got really educated on this issue, but you never see it on the media, they could basically reverse what's going on.
[01:39:21.549 --> 01:39:25.331]  But of course, it's not just the Jewish politicians, it's basically all of them.
[01:39:26.492 --> 01:39:38.005]  But if you think about it, when you have a look at the open border situation, I mean, we've had Republican Presidents, Republican Congresses, Democratic Presidents, Democratic Congresses, and they all talk about closing the border and it all stays open.
[01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:41.168]  So I don't look at it as being a Jewish, a Christian, a Democratic, Republican issue.
[01:39:41.168 --> 01:39:42.369]  It's just well beyond that.
[01:39:42.369 --> 01:39:43.550]  Nobody's looking at that issue.
[01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:45.272]  No, no, I agree with you, but let me throw this in.
[01:39:46.133 --> 01:39:52.977]  Uh, Jeffrey Goldberg came down here from Atlantic Monthly probably six months ago to interview me, and he's a huge Israeli first-year.
[01:39:52.977 --> 01:39:58.741]  I mean, you know, a member of the IDF, prison guard, whole nine yards, wrote the key reports about fake WMDs.
[01:39:58.741 --> 01:40:05.645]  He's credited with being one of the key people to lead us to the 2003 war, and he wanted to come down here and do a piece on me, and he's still working on it.
[01:40:05.645 --> 01:40:09.767]  And, you know, so he's a pretty high-powered guy, so I agreed to meet with him, and he agreed.
[01:40:09.767 --> 01:40:10.988]  He said, yeah, no, the ADL
[01:40:11.568 --> 01:40:11.648]  It's
[01:40:27.731 --> 01:40:36.475]  Who have defended Israel in the past, then get demonized by B'nai B'rith and others, and it makes them very, very angry.
[01:40:36.475 --> 01:40:47.621]  So I just think that also the Democratic Party has kind of used some of these ADL-type groups as a way to paint their enemies, and I think that's backfiring big time as well.
[01:40:48.341 --> 01:41:09.186]  The average person listening in, the average person who is a Democratic by their name when they go vote in the primaries, a Republican when they go vote in the primaries, is so busy raising a family, trying to keep their roof over their head, trying to make sure their car engine starts, trying to make sure their kids stay in school and do okay, that they simply just follow along sometimes with what the party says because they don't research
[01:41:09.306 --> 01:41:12.588]  I've been called a racist because I was against what Obama was doing with healthcare, absolutely.
[01:41:38.704 --> 01:41:44.506]  And you were telling me off air that you had a guest on about Obama's birth certificate and the death threats rolled in.
[01:41:44.506 --> 01:41:44.726]  Sure.
[01:41:44.726 --> 01:41:46.567]  I mean that's just crazy.
[01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:51.528]  So overall I just think the climate is getting nastier because the economy is falling apart.
[01:41:51.528 --> 01:41:54.509]  And I think people are going to look for convenient scapegoats.
[01:41:54.509 --> 01:41:58.230]  And we know historically one of the favorite ones is Jews.
[01:41:58.230 --> 01:42:02.272]  And I do think that it's a dangerous scapegoat because we need to all look ourselves in the mirror.
[01:42:03.072 --> 01:42:03.452]  I don't know.
[01:42:24.559 --> 01:42:32.806]  But groups just like to sit there and beat the drum and conveniently blame one group or another.
[01:42:32.806 --> 01:42:37.811]  And overall, every time things start collapsing in history, we see this happen.
[01:42:38.499 --> 01:42:40.861]  Well, government works by creating crisis.
[01:42:40.861 --> 01:42:50.268]  When crisis happens, people say, listen, the world's economic situations, they come into total, utter chaos unless you do X. And X is really bad, but the unknown is much worse.
[01:42:50.268 --> 01:42:51.589]  But we have to act right now.
[01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:52.089]  What do you want?
[01:42:52.089 --> 01:42:54.911]  The really super terrible or even worse that you don't know?
[01:42:54.911 --> 01:42:57.974]  So people, government works by creating a chaos, by creating
[01:42:58.374 --> 01:42:59.355]  We're good to go.
[01:43:18.303 --> 01:43:27.369]  And then we sit back six weeks later and go, wait a second, it wasn't nearly as bad as we thought it was, or this was largely manipulated, or we were only given part of the facts, or the facts were exaggerated.
[01:43:27.369 --> 01:43:34.214]  But government works by creating a frenzy, by creating a fear, and by saying, well, we don't trust government, however, if they don't fix it, it'll be worse.
[01:43:34.654 --> 01:43:50.322]  Well, Victor Ostrofsky, of course, former naval captain in the Israeli forces and then a member of the Mossad, he was in the Washington Post this morning calling it so stupid it's stupefying the way they did it, and he said that clearly the
[01:43:51.383 --> 01:43:55.728]  The naval forces and the commandos had no hand in their orders.
[01:43:55.728 --> 01:44:08.644]  They were clearly told by people that didn't know what they were doing what to do, and that they should have simply gotten aboard of the ships once they entered Israeli water, that he thinks it's illegal, that it was international water, and that agrees with the other wide spectrum of experts.
[01:44:10.546 --> 01:44:21.622]  Well, they should have just come up and disabled the rudders with metal nets they just throw into the propellers and that would have been the end of the story right there instead of these dramatic images.
[01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:26.709]  So I think Israel was wrong in doing that, but I don't just join in on lies.
[01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:32.437]  Uh, clearly the commandos were not firing when they bordered, and they were attacked with the Poles.
[01:44:32.437 --> 01:44:37.685]  And now there is the video of the people throwing flashbangs at the borders.
[01:44:37.685 --> 01:44:41.430]  And so that appears to be the bangs that were heard ahead of things.
[01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:42.611]  But, I'll go further.
[01:44:43.472 --> 01:44:52.416]  Uh, Victor says that there were probably Israeli, for sure, Mossad on board who infiltrated the grips, so who knows if they were provocateur-ing.
[01:44:52.416 --> 01:44:58.518]  Uh, but, I mean, because we've just seen this from intelligence agencies, so I think the bottom line is we don't know what happened here.
[01:44:58.518 --> 01:45:02.400]  Uh, but I'm glad that Turkey is now saying that...
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:10.945]  Cooler heads need to prevail, and they're backing off of their stance of military confrontation yesterday, because can you imagine?
[01:45:10.945 --> 01:45:18.890]  Well, Turkey's a NATO member, and Israel's a NATO member, and the last thing we need is two NATO members shooting at one another over what really is in the big picture things.
[01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:23.792]  You mentioned there's 23,000 people killed along the Mexican border, and nobody seems to care about that.
[01:45:23.792 --> 01:45:27.795]  But we have an incident where two countries have an agitation at sea.
[01:45:27.795 --> 01:45:29.216]  Both countries think that they're right.
[01:45:29.216 --> 01:45:31.037]  Both countries think they did the right thing.
[01:45:31.037 --> 01:45:32.438]  Nine people die, and it's bad.
[01:45:32.978 --> 01:45:34.799]  And that's going to cause World War 3.
[01:45:34.799 --> 01:45:36.620]  And the last thing Israel needs is a war.
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:39.602]  Israel's like in some areas like 10, 12, 15 miles wide.
[01:45:39.602 --> 01:45:42.104]  The last thing a country that small needs is war.
[01:45:42.104 --> 01:45:44.805]  And I know a lot of people think that Israel wants war.
[01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:46.546]  Israel can't sustain war.
[01:45:46.546 --> 01:45:49.648]  Israel can inflict a lot of damage on other countries if they're attacked.
[01:45:49.648 --> 01:45:54.171]  Because from the standpoint of taking a sustained war against them, they wouldn't be around to see the end of it.
[01:45:55.643 --> 01:45:57.324]  Well, here's a new video that's out.
[01:45:57.324 --> 01:46:03.869]  Israelis celebrating attack on Turkish aid ship in front of Turkish Embassy Tel Aviv.
[01:46:03.869 --> 01:46:07.131]  That is not going to be a good PR move.
[01:46:07.131 --> 01:46:10.673]  If there's one quarter of one percent of crazy people, they're in Israel, too.
[01:46:10.673 --> 01:46:10.973]  No, no, no.
[01:46:10.973 --> 01:46:16.457]  That's like the people that say they're anti-gays, so they go protest at the funerals of troops.
[01:46:16.457 --> 01:46:19.279]  I mean, and I've watched videos of those guys.
[01:46:19.279 --> 01:46:20.060]  They really think
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:22.023]  They're doing something good.
[01:46:22.023 --> 01:46:28.376]  All they're doing is making themselves and anybody who thinks the homosexual lifestyle is destructive look like idiots.
[01:46:28.991 --> 01:46:35.116]  Yeah, no, there's fringe groups and everything, and the problem is if we only put the camera on the fringe group, then we think that's what that whole country is.
[01:46:35.116 --> 01:46:39.179]  Every black person's this, because we showed some six crazy black people.
[01:46:39.179 --> 01:46:41.901]  Every white person's this, because we showed six crazy white people.
[01:46:41.901 --> 01:46:47.826]  And it makes everybody look stupid when the rest of the people are going, hey, I know all those, lots of people in my group, and none of us act like that.
[01:46:47.826 --> 01:46:50.708]  They specifically choose what makes people agitated.
[01:46:50.708 --> 01:46:52.730]  And by the way, government works by keeping people apart.
[01:46:53.490 --> 01:47:01.977]  If whites hate blacks, and blacks hate Mexicans, and Mexicans hate Jews, the more people that are separated, the less we can get together, the more government control.
[01:47:01.977 --> 01:47:05.239]  And then meanwhile, the big corporate editors can take over our society.
[01:47:05.239 --> 01:47:08.882]  We've got you for the rest of this segment, one more, and I'm going to keep you five minutes over if you can do it.
[01:47:10.743 --> 01:47:13.965]  Dr. John Coleman coming on about Committee of 300.
[01:47:13.965 --> 01:47:15.106]  Let's go to these calls now.
[01:47:15.106 --> 01:47:20.430]  Again, why you love Israel or why you hate it.
[01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:23.072]  He asked for it, so we're doing it.
[01:47:23.072 --> 01:47:28.795]  But at a certain level, folks, this is a diversion from the economy falling apart, from all the new taxes.
[01:47:28.795 --> 01:47:33.098]  I mean, I almost feel dirty even getting sucked into all this.
[01:47:33.098 --> 01:47:35.440]  But, you know, it's just the nature of it.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.862]  And I try over the years to stay out of it.
[01:47:38.502 --> 01:47:41.845]  But it's the same thing with the borders, you cannot stay out of it.
[01:47:41.845 --> 01:47:45.167]  Kevin in Nebraska, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:47:45.167 --> 01:48:00.379]  Hi, you guys both touched on what I'm going to mention, but essentially I think we have to look at the real big picture and we have to look at it as the incident was either created by the Bilderberg Group or it wasn't, and if it wasn't then
[01:48:01.132 --> 01:48:03.593]  How are they going to spin it through the media now?
[01:48:03.593 --> 01:48:04.913]  Well, that's another question.
[01:48:04.913 --> 01:48:12.314]  Why are all these crises all over the world suddenly popping up in the middle of the biggest banking takeover in history?
[01:48:12.314 --> 01:48:13.215]  That's a key point.
[01:48:13.215 --> 01:48:17.336]  I mean, and something stinks in this whole thing.
[01:48:17.336 --> 01:48:21.396]  The way it was timed for the peace process, for Netanyahu to be in D.C.
[01:48:21.396 --> 01:48:23.157]  Your take on that, Doctor?
[01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:25.558]  Well, I don't know who did what.
[01:48:25.558 --> 01:48:26.759]  I think that you're right.
[01:48:26.759 --> 01:48:31.821]  When those ships left Turkey, it was with the intention of creating some type of world event.
[01:48:31.821 --> 01:48:33.722]  Because they knew that a blockade was there.
[01:48:33.722 --> 01:48:35.863]  Israel said, you come by, we're going to board you.
[01:48:35.863 --> 01:48:37.604]  They said, we know what we're coming anyway.
[01:48:37.604 --> 01:48:43.007]  We've got our camera people on board, and the rest will be great video fun for the rest of YouTube.
[01:48:43.007 --> 01:48:46.669]  So yeah, it was sent there to create exactly what we got, which is some people
[01:48:47.029 --> 01:48:47.710]  Well said.
[01:48:47.710 --> 01:48:48.211]  Anything else, Kevin?
[01:49:04.196 --> 01:49:09.237]  Yeah, just I guess that we need to look at what the what agenda they're pushing.
[01:49:09.237 --> 01:49:13.738]  I mean is it just a smoke screen for the economy takeover or what's the deal?
[01:49:13.738 --> 01:49:19.820]  I guess that's just the thing to focus on is what's the build of our game through all this since they basically control the media.
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:20.980]  So that's it.
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:21.860]  Thanks.
[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:23.640]  I appreciate your call Kevin.
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.461]  Brad in Idaho.
[01:49:25.461 --> 01:49:25.981]  You're on the air.
[01:49:27.306 --> 01:49:28.827]  Did you say Brad?
[01:49:28.827 --> 01:49:30.128]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:30.128 --> 01:49:30.868]  Okay, sorry about that.
[01:49:30.868 --> 01:49:31.869]  No, it's okay.
[01:49:31.869 --> 01:49:35.391]  I have three real quick points, if I can, I'll try.
[01:49:35.391 --> 01:49:42.515]  You know, the Bible, I think people are so passionate because their belief system from the Bible.
[01:49:42.515 --> 01:49:53.122]  And there's lots of great theologians in history that don't believe that the Bible predicts a new state of Israel, and then there's people, there's theologians that do believe that.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:57.702]  I think the big passionate problem is people's belief system.
[01:49:57.702 --> 01:50:05.085]  And so they either believe Israel is predicted by God, and so justice doesn't matter.
[01:50:05.085 --> 01:50:12.428]  And I think they've lost their sense of standing for justice because of their belief.
[01:50:12.428 --> 01:50:22.272]  And then my other point is, yes, the Jews and the Israelites... I mean, the Israelites and the Arabs fought 2,000 years ago, and a thousand years past that.
[01:50:23.052 --> 01:50:30.266]  But for the 2,000 years since Rome destroyed Israel, or Judea, there really hasn't been a war between Jews.
[01:50:31.016 --> 01:50:35.340]  Well, there are a whole bunch of them.
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:36.300]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you.
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:37.321]  There are a whole bunch.
[01:50:37.321 --> 01:50:47.149]  Whether like three, four wars that Israel's had or even more if you count the smaller situations like 18 months ago or three years ago with what happened in Lebanon.
[01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:48.430]  But yeah, it's almost 2,000 years.
[01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:49.291]  It's 1,960 years since
[01:50:58.482 --> 01:51:01.443]  Titus sacked Rome, or a little bit longer.
[01:51:01.443 --> 01:51:02.744]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.744 --> 01:51:08.327]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.327 --> 01:51:13.349]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.349 --> 01:51:18.912]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.912 --> 01:51:24.154]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.154 --> 01:51:26.035]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:26.454 --> 01:51:31.256]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.256 --> 01:51:32.377]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.377 --> 01:51:35.438]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.438 --> 01:51:39.060]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:42.261]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.261 --> 01:51:44.462]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.462 --> 01:51:45.423]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.423 --> 01:51:45.663]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.663 --> 01:51:46.723]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:51:55.546 --> 01:51:58.109]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.109 --> 01:52:01.312]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.312 --> 01:52:04.235]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:06.647 --> 01:52:07.027]  We're good to go.
[01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:38.768]  You'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.

[01:53:04.450 --> 01:53:06.531]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:09.273]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:09.273 --> 01:53:11.515]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:11.515 --> 01:53:12.915]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:53:12.915 --> 01:53:14.817]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:14.817 --> 01:53:16.758]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:16.758 --> 01:53:18.739]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:18.739 --> 01:53:22.422]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:22.422 --> 01:53:30.166]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[01:53:52.361 --> 01:53:52.761]  It works!
[01:54:02.602 --> 01:54:07.012]  Yeah, well it was Titus destroyed Jerusalem 1940 years ago or 70 AD.
[01:54:13.752 --> 01:54:14.972]  Now, I want to go back to your calls.
[01:54:14.972 --> 01:54:17.173]  We've only got this segment and one other with our guest.
[01:54:17.173 --> 01:54:22.394]  We'll have to have him back, especially if he wants to open the phones up and have one of these debates.
[01:54:22.394 --> 01:54:30.917]  I think it is healthy to discuss it, but I've got a more hardcore email here before I go back to your calls.
[01:54:30.917 --> 01:54:32.417]  Alex, I've got a question for your guest.
[01:54:32.417 --> 01:54:37.659]  Jewish people believe they are the chosen people, so with that belief, does that not promote
[01:54:38.439 --> 01:54:39.680]  You are above everybody else.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:45.666]  The fact that the Israeli military invaded a flagged Turkish ship, international waters, and killed citizens in the middle of the night.
[01:54:45.666 --> 01:54:48.489]  That ship is the sovereign land, the land of the flag.
[01:54:48.489 --> 01:54:49.550]  It flies, period.
[01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:55.636]  If a group enters our property with automatic weapons in the middle of the night, even the sheeple will fight back for self-preservation.
[01:54:56.617 --> 01:54:59.580]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:01.662]  I don't have time to read it all.
[01:55:01.662 --> 01:55:04.164]  But what do you say to Chris, who sent that email?
[01:55:04.164 --> 01:55:06.666]  Well, I think that he had two different things going on.
[01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:09.028]  One is, does Israel have a right to board the ships?
[01:55:09.028 --> 01:55:12.171]  And we can debate whether or not you have a right to, if you think.
[01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:22.180]  If America thought that weapons were going to be heading off to Mexico to be launched against America, we'd probably board the ships at sea, and we'd all think they were heroes when they were found, and we'd think that we were bums if they didn't find them.
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.441]  George Bush would be a hero today if there was lots of weapons of mass destruction.
[01:55:25.441 --> 01:55:29.203]  He's kind of a bum because he went to a war for no good reason.
[01:55:29.203 --> 01:55:35.105]  About being the chosen people, boy, we couldn't have chosen a worse slogan if you could think of it.
[01:55:35.105 --> 01:55:39.987]  Every nation and every religion takes pride in that they believe what their religion is true.
[01:55:40.407 --> 01:55:43.970]  And they believe that the people who follow that religion are correct.
[01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:46.593]  Christians believe that those who follow Christianity are correct.
[01:55:46.593 --> 01:55:49.656]  Muslims believe that those who follow the Muslim faith are correct.
[01:55:49.656 --> 01:55:53.179]  And Jews believe that those who follow the Jewish faith are correct as well.
[01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:56.843]  And everybody likes to take, you know, believe that what they say is right.
[01:55:56.843 --> 01:55:58.044]  And that God loves them.
[01:55:59.004 --> 01:56:01.987]  In today's modern world, I'm a reformed Jew.
[01:56:01.987 --> 01:56:04.169]  We don't look at the concept of being the chosen people.
[01:56:04.169 --> 01:56:09.833]  We look at it as being people who are Jewish, and we don't think that we're different or better or more superior to any other religion.
[01:56:09.833 --> 01:56:15.398]  And by the way, the majority of Jews fall to be either reformed or conservative, not orthodox.
[01:56:15.398 --> 01:56:19.642]  If you're watching Yentl on television and you think that's a stereotypical Jew, that's not a Jew nowadays.
[01:56:19.642 --> 01:56:23.985]  There are some of them, and I know they're listening out there and they're mad at me, but that's maybe 1% or 2% of the Jews in the world.
[01:56:25.046 --> 01:56:27.768]  Well, a lot of the Orthodox Jews believe Israel doesn't have a right to exist.
[01:56:27.768 --> 01:56:28.869]  You've got the Neutrocardian New York.
[01:56:28.869 --> 01:56:29.269]  You're right.
[01:56:29.269 --> 01:56:30.690]  It just goes on and on.
[01:56:30.690 --> 01:56:32.091]  I won't be able to get us some call.
[01:56:32.091 --> 01:56:33.171]  I just wanted to throw his email on.
[01:56:33.171 --> 01:56:34.772]  I think you answered it well.
[01:56:34.772 --> 01:56:36.694]  Brad, finishing up your point, I held you over.
[01:56:36.694 --> 01:56:38.875]  Go ahead.
[01:56:38.875 --> 01:56:49.002]  So, not counting the past hundred years, so for like 1800 years, there was no wars between Jews and Arabs that I can see in history.
[01:56:49.002 --> 01:56:53.765]  And then the other thing, the last point I wanted to make is, I believe that the bankers
[01:56:54.878 --> 01:56:55.698]  I don't know.
[01:57:05.766 --> 01:57:07.907]  And I think they're just pawns.
[01:57:07.907 --> 01:57:09.108]  Well, that's another issue.
[01:57:09.108 --> 01:57:14.110]  Saying that the Palestinians are being used by other Arab countries as pawns is true.
[01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:19.413]  And I think at certain levels, the Jews that are in Israel are also used as geopolitical pawns.
[01:57:19.413 --> 01:57:20.854]  Well, people are pawns of their government.
[01:57:20.854 --> 01:57:23.415]  The people in North Korea, for the most part, don't want to be oppressed.
[01:57:23.415 --> 01:57:25.537]  The people in other countries don't want to be oppressed.
[01:57:25.537 --> 01:57:26.717]  Governments run their countries.
[01:57:26.717 --> 01:57:29.619]  The people, for the most part, just don't want to be killed each day.
[01:57:30.199 --> 01:57:34.822]  That's my problem with the cop-out saying the source of all evil on the planet is Israel and Jews.
[01:57:34.822 --> 01:57:36.102]  That's just not true.
[01:57:36.102 --> 01:57:43.567]  There was evil going on in every country before Jews ever arrived, and it really is a bunch of hocus-pocus to say that, you know, Jews are evil.
[01:57:43.567 --> 01:57:44.607]  Are there evil Jews?
[01:57:44.607 --> 01:57:45.048]  Yes.
[01:57:45.048 --> 01:57:46.589]  Well, take it one step further.
[01:57:46.589 --> 01:57:53.853]  If every Jew just disappeared today and we all took a carnival cruise to Mars, you don't think the world would be full of evil people and evil governments?
[01:57:54.153 --> 01:57:56.154]  No, it's ridiculous.
[01:57:56.154 --> 01:57:59.116]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:59.116 --> 01:58:01.758]  It's a religion, though, hating Jews.
[01:58:01.758 --> 01:58:05.900]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carl in Michigan.
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:07.041]  Quickly, Carl, as we're going to break.
[01:58:07.041 --> 01:58:08.081]  Go ahead.
[01:58:08.081 --> 01:58:11.603]  Alex, it's good to get on the show, so I'll leave that brief.
[01:58:11.603 --> 01:58:22.470]  What I wanted to say is basically Israel, as many nations since the beginning of time, established their country and drew out their boundaries by force.
[01:58:23.443 --> 01:58:34.914]  And then when they get established in a position, then they dictate to other countries whether or not they have the, you know, the right to do that as well.
[01:58:34.914 --> 01:58:36.616]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:36.616 --> 01:58:39.078]  We're back in 70 seconds with a third hour.
[01:58:39.078 --> 01:58:43.342]  Stay with us.
[01:58:43.342 --> 01:58:45.824]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.824 --> 01:58:48.207]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.831 --> 01:58:52.132]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.132 --> 01:58:57.716]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:58:57.716 --> 01:59:02.739]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:59:02.739 --> 01:59:07.783]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:59:08.303 --> 01:59:13.527]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:13.527 --> 01:59:15.848]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:20.651]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:20.651 --> 01:59:21.772]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:21.772 --> 01:59:24.834]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:59:24.834 --> 01:59:28.457]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:28.457 --> 01:59:31.659]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:59:31.659 --> 01:59:33.880]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:34.801]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:59:39.804 --> 01:59:42.665]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:42.665 --> 01:59:47.507]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:47.507 --> 01:59:53.970]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:53.970 --> 01:59:56.371]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.371 --> 02:00:05.896]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.896 --> 02:00:06.476]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:08.963]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.963 --> 02:00:10.706]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.706 --> 02:00:12.308]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.308 --> 02:00:13.850]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:18.056]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.056 --> 02:00:22.102]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.789 --> 02:00:30.715]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv at the start of the next segment with Dr. John Coleman.
[02:00:30.715 --> 02:00:34.459]  This has gone by really fast, so I want to try to jam in more of your calls.
[02:00:34.459 --> 02:00:35.680]  John, Rudy, Mike, Chuck.
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:39.584]  We'll get to everybody, even though our guest has to leave us here in a moment.
[02:00:39.584 --> 02:00:42.567]  But finishing up your point, Carl, go ahead.
[02:00:42.567 --> 02:00:44.229]  I feel somewhat under pressure.
[02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:46.011]  I realize there's a short time segment here.
[02:00:47.171 --> 02:01:13.067]  Okay, going back to the Holocaust and the fact that they had the right to defend themselves and the allies against Hitler and us against the Japanese after Pearl Harbor, those are definite, but I think people are still publicizing this so much, things that occurred years ago, that we're the underdogs, they're the underdogs, and it has to come a time when
[02:01:13.672 --> 02:01:13.872]  I don't
[02:01:28.806 --> 02:01:33.832]  Well, no, clearly Israel had the world's support when they were the underdog.
[02:01:33.832 --> 02:01:36.034]  More and more people do not see Israel as the underdog.
[02:01:36.034 --> 02:01:37.676]  That's a very valid point.
[02:01:37.676 --> 02:01:39.658]  Comments on that, Dr. Gold?
[02:01:39.658 --> 02:01:45.224]  Well, after World War II, a lot of the world felt pretty bad about letting the Holocaust happen.
[02:01:45.224 --> 02:01:48.668]  And yeah, and they felt like, hey, we owe these people a little bit because we let this all go on.
[02:01:49.268 --> 02:01:52.030]  And, but, yeah, Israel's a sovereign nation now.
[02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:54.312]  Israel should be taking care of its own business.
[02:01:54.312 --> 02:01:58.515]  I don't think Israel dictates a lot to Iraq or Iran or Saudi Arabia.
[02:01:58.515 --> 02:02:03.598]  Well, I think the argument is, is through the pro-war Israel lobby they do.
[02:02:03.598 --> 02:02:07.381]  Well, I mean, Saudi Arabia has a very strong lobbying group as well.
[02:02:07.381 --> 02:02:17.048]  No, no, no, I agree that Israel's not the only powerful lobby, but, I mean, have you seen the Sharon quotes in the Jerusalem Post in places?
[02:02:17.048 --> 02:02:18.309]  And that's one reason people get upset.
[02:02:19.008 --> 02:02:24.252]  Well, I've seen quotes from Obama that make me upset as well, and I've seen quotes from Bush that make me upset as well.
[02:02:24.252 --> 02:02:26.673]  So if we were to take isolated quotes, we'd get everybody upset all day.
[02:02:26.673 --> 02:02:27.474]  Yeah.
[02:02:27.474 --> 02:02:30.296]  Alright, let's jam in another quick call here.
[02:02:30.296 --> 02:02:31.597]  John in Ohio, go ahead.
[02:02:32.822 --> 02:02:35.664]  Yeah, I hope you have on Ralph Schoenman.
[02:02:35.664 --> 02:02:43.908]  He's written the monograph, The Hidden History of Zionism, or James Petras on Global Research.
[02:02:43.908 --> 02:02:45.909]  I've had Schoenman on before.
[02:02:45.909 --> 02:02:46.990]  He's an eloquent guy.
[02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:50.291]  He's also basically a communist, and I don't like communists.
[02:02:50.291 --> 02:02:58.496]  Yeah, well, you do a lot of red-baiting, but at the same time... John, you've called in and admit you're a commie!
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:03.156]  Don't try that mind control on me that I'm imagining commies!
[02:03:04.005 --> 02:03:09.849]  Well, I've never belonged to any organization, but what I see is... Do you believe in communism?
[02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:14.233]  I believe that the workers should control everything, rather than these elitist bankers.
[02:03:14.233 --> 02:03:16.595]  Just keep your hands off my property, John.
[02:03:16.595 --> 02:03:20.397]  It's not... well, you own the trillions... Bad stuff's gonna happen.
[02:03:20.397 --> 02:03:23.660]  The trillions of dollars' derivatives, I'm sure that you don't own those.
[02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:27.883]  And that's the only people that are going to be suffering under any kind of... No, no, I agree with you.
[02:03:27.883 --> 02:03:28.604]  That's fraudulent.
[02:03:28.604 --> 02:03:30.625]  But listen, we only got a minute and a half with our guest.
[02:03:30.625 --> 02:03:31.526]  Go ahead.
[02:03:31.526 --> 02:03:32.707]  The point I'd like to make here
[02:03:33.347 --> 02:03:41.089]  It is that Israel, the Zionist lobby in this country, has plenty of spokesmen.
[02:03:41.089 --> 02:03:46.290]  It has people throughout the media in the latest government that dragged us into this war.
[02:03:46.290 --> 02:03:47.810]  Many of them were dual citizens.
[02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:50.251]  We have the same thing in the Obama administration.
[02:03:50.251 --> 02:03:52.152]  Dragged us into what war?
[02:03:52.152 --> 02:03:53.972]  John, what war are you talking about, John?
[02:03:53.972 --> 02:03:54.892]  Make my point.
[02:03:54.892 --> 02:03:55.732]  John, what war?
[02:03:55.732 --> 02:03:56.953]  You said dragged us into this war.
[02:03:56.953 --> 02:03:58.133]  He's talking about Iraq and Iran.
[02:03:58.737 --> 02:04:08.222]  Yes, I'm talking about Iraq and Iran, and they are now at this point bringing nuclear weapons and threatening to use nuclear weapons against Iran.
[02:04:08.222 --> 02:04:15.505]  This would be World War III, and I think this is disgusting at this point that we need more of this kind of propaganda.
[02:04:15.505 --> 02:04:16.245]  John, let's take it back there.
[02:04:16.245 --> 02:04:17.666]  John, we're almost out of time.
[02:04:17.666 --> 02:04:20.507]  I'll have Mr. Gold back up, but let me just say this.
[02:04:20.507 --> 02:04:27.751]  It's free speech, it's different perspectives, and to say that other people shouldn't have a... Go ahead, Mr. Gold.
[02:04:28.371 --> 02:04:32.352]  What I was saying is, if Israel wanted to start a war with Iran, they could do it any day they wanted to.
[02:04:32.352 --> 02:04:35.333]  If Israel wanted to nuke Iran, they could have done it long ago.
[02:04:35.333 --> 02:04:38.854]  So, just to say they wanted to do it, but haven't done it, is ridiculous.
[02:04:38.854 --> 02:04:41.275]  If Israel wanted a war with Iran, there'd be a war with Iran.
[02:04:41.275 --> 02:04:42.575]  They don't want a war with Iran.
[02:04:42.575 --> 02:04:43.515]  Otherwise, we'd have one.
[02:04:43.515 --> 02:04:45.376]  Listen, is there a website you want to find out?
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:47.601]  No, I'm all cool.
[02:04:47.601 --> 02:04:49.442]  I go to KSCO.com.
[02:04:49.442 --> 02:04:50.323]  That's my radio station.
[02:04:50.323 --> 02:04:52.225]  KSCO.com.
[02:04:52.225 --> 02:04:54.307]  Dr. Corey Gold, good talking to you.
[02:04:54.307 --> 02:04:55.088]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:55.088 --> 02:04:58.110]  Alright, we'll be back with Dr. John Coleman.
[02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:00.593]  That was a heated debate, wasn't it?
[02:05:00.933 --> 02:05:02.574]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.574 --> 02:05:05.956]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[02:05:05.956 --> 02:05:11.179]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[02:05:11.179 --> 02:05:14.601]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[02:05:14.601 --> 02:05:16.943]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:05:17.583 --> 02:05:21.106]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[02:05:21.106 --> 02:05:22.247]  Take my word for it.
[02:05:22.247 --> 02:05:24.910]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:31.415]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:05:31.415 --> 02:05:32.937]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:36.620]  Or call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:37.961]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:49.172]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed or double your dirt back!

[02:05:53.453 --> 02:05:54.093]  Thank you!
[02:06:00.632 --> 02:06:02.974]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:06:02.974 --> 02:06:05.336]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:06:05.336 --> 02:06:08.558]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:06:08.558 --> 02:06:13.662]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:06:13.662 --> 02:06:17.866]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:06:18.166 --> 02:06:20.527]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:06:20.527 --> 02:06:23.408]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:06:23.408 --> 02:06:26.310]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:33.913]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:06:34.252 --> 02:06:39.655]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:06:39.655 --> 02:06:41.956]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:06:41.956 --> 02:06:46.178]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:06:46.178 --> 02:06:47.259]  And I got news for you.
[02:06:47.259 --> 02:06:48.600]  You're everyone else.
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.100]  Invisible Empire.

[02:07:01.175 --> 02:07:04.179]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.179 --> 02:07:09.505]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.505 --> 02:07:11.568]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.568 --> 02:07:16.554]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.554 --> 02:07:17.756]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.756 --> 02:07:18.477]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.857 --> 02:07:20.738]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.738 --> 02:07:21.819]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.819 --> 02:07:24.020]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:25.341]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.341 --> 02:07:26.881]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.881 --> 02:07:32.144]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.144 --> 02:07:35.286]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.726 --> 02:07:39.549]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.549 --> 02:07:40.769]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.769 --> 02:07:41.690]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.690 --> 02:07:42.791]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:43.711]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.711 --> 02:07:44.812]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.812 --> 02:07:47.854]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.854 --> 02:07:49.635]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.635 --> 02:07:50.556]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.338 --> 02:08:04.559]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.559 --> 02:08:07.920]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:27.987 --> 02:08:32.329]  All right, we are now eight minutes into our number three.
[02:08:32.329 --> 02:08:56.323]  We've got Paul Watson joining us via video Skype connection, audio for radio listeners, visually for PrisonPlanet.tv members in the first 30 minutes of the next hour, then Charlie Skelton who writes for the Evening Standard, and the one Guardian reporter in Spain for Bilderberg 2010, giving us a first report on the closing of the resort and hotel today, and the top globalist arriving.
[02:08:57.123 --> 02:09:04.728]  Before we go any further, the film Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, is our newest documentary that we have produced.
[02:09:04.728 --> 02:09:11.332]  Jason Mermis is the director, and for the first time ever, the secret agenda of the planet's ruthless superclass is exposed.
[02:09:11.332 --> 02:09:18.937]  In stark detail, this documentary film chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:09:19.437 --> 02:09:26.920]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, media propaganda, and debt.
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:32.342]  The criminal controllers have successfully dominated the globe and are now in their final phase of consolidating power.
[02:09:32.342 --> 02:09:38.664]  Government narcotics trafficking, white slavery rings, the pervert guilds, how they control people in Congress.
[02:09:39.878 --> 02:09:41.998]  How Different Globalist Organizations Tie Together.
[02:09:41.998 --> 02:09:45.419]  Two hours, 24 minutes, with extensive extras.
[02:09:45.419 --> 02:09:52.361]  It's got, of course, G. Edward Griffin, it's got Peter Dale Scott, and many, many others in the film, and I consulted on it.
[02:09:52.361 --> 02:09:59.722]  Very important documentary, and your purchase of the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the material, you are what makes this show possible.
[02:09:59.722 --> 02:10:06.344]  So, not only is this a great tool to wake up your friends and family, and also to inform you to a higher level, it also funds our operation.
[02:10:06.784 --> 02:10:14.769]  Of course, for people that want to understand the banking collapse that's happening, how the globalists are doing it, how they're behind it, fall of the republic.
[02:10:14.769 --> 02:10:24.296]  For folks that want to know how to take the states back, and the difference between a democracy and a republic, and the move to have sheriffs elected that'll say no to the feds, this should be given to every sheriff you know.
[02:10:24.296 --> 02:10:25.577]  The DVD is available.
[02:10:26.494 --> 02:10:28.514]  At Infowars.com.
[02:10:28.514 --> 02:10:31.695]  Don't tread on me, rise of the Republican, of course I'm in it.
[02:10:31.695 --> 02:10:36.996]  Back in print after 20 years being out of print, The Secret Team by L. Fletcher Prouty.
[02:10:36.996 --> 02:10:40.277]  How the top banks ran the Communist and the U.S.
[02:10:40.277 --> 02:10:44.458]  He was the head of black ops for the Pentagon, CIA liaison.
[02:10:44.458 --> 02:10:46.778]  This is the book the CIA doesn't want you to read.
[02:10:46.778 --> 02:10:49.299]  Available at Infowars.com.
[02:10:49.299 --> 02:10:55.000]  You want to understand the police state control grid and have all the intel on what's being set up in the United States.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:00.582]  The latest film that I directed with Rob Dew and Jason Douglas, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:11:00.582 --> 02:11:02.003]  It covers it all.
[02:11:02.003 --> 02:11:09.026]  Again, available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:11:09.026 --> 02:11:14.448]  I want to thank everyone that has been supporting us buying the books and videos.
[02:11:14.448 --> 02:11:17.629]  More importantly though, if you own the books and videos, give them to people.
[02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:19.130]  Make copies of my films.
[02:11:19.130 --> 02:11:19.670]  Get them out.
[02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:20.671]  Air them on AXS TV.
[02:11:20.671 --> 02:11:21.951]  Show them to your church.
[02:11:21.951 --> 02:11:23.832]  People are ready to be awakened right now.
[02:11:24.272 --> 02:11:24.812]  I don't know.
[02:11:43.761 --> 02:11:50.226]  One of the fastest growing radio programs in the world and the number one alternative radio show on the planet.
[02:11:50.226 --> 02:12:07.258]  We have the number one and number two, respectively, biggest alternative news websites according to Alexa.com and other major statistical algorithms out there on the web, Google Analytics, and we are doubling our web presence every year.
[02:12:07.258 --> 02:12:08.459]  So very, very exciting.
[02:12:08.459 --> 02:12:09.840]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:11.121]  Okay, without further ado,
[02:12:12.261 --> 02:12:17.184]  I just want to point out, you made it possible, folks, and I commend you, and we're trying to go to the next level.
[02:12:17.184 --> 02:12:18.365]  And we can do it with your support.
[02:12:42.361 --> 02:12:43.401]  Distinction.
[02:12:43.401 --> 02:12:53.043]  And he also is the big researcher on the Committee of 300, a political science economist, Dr. Coleman, on location, hands-on experience in the field of different countries.
[02:12:53.043 --> 02:12:55.963]  Makes him a writer, scholar, and lecturer of distinction.
[02:12:55.963 --> 02:13:03.465]  The Committee of 300, The Vanishing Middle Class, Apocalypse Waiting to Happen, Obama's America, Beyond the Conspiracy, and many more.
[02:13:03.465 --> 02:13:09.526]  Check out his books and more at Coleman 300 and his other materials at Coleman300.com.
[02:13:10.686 --> 02:13:14.488]  Dr. Coleman, great to have you with us today, sir.
[02:13:14.488 --> 02:13:15.729]  Thank you so much.
[02:13:15.729 --> 02:13:20.392]  All right, in the 46 minutes we've got left now, time is flying, you've got the floor.
[02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:26.116]  What is the Committee of 300, what is the world government, and where is it taking us?
[02:13:26.116 --> 02:13:28.197]  The Committee of 300 is the world government.
[02:13:28.197 --> 02:13:29.458]  It's one of your
[02:13:30.342 --> 02:13:34.224]  Previous programs, there was a gentleman asking about the New World Order.
[02:13:34.224 --> 02:13:34.905]  How is it run?
[02:13:34.905 --> 02:13:36.185]  Well, it's run through the Committee of 300.
[02:13:36.185 --> 02:13:43.269]  They were also known as the Olympians in the early days, and men spoke about them under their breath, for fear of them.
[02:13:43.269 --> 02:13:53.796]  This is a massive organization, which in the beginning was run mainly by the royalty in Europe, but now, of course, it's spread all over the world.
[02:13:53.796 --> 02:13:54.336]  The American
[02:13:55.226 --> 02:14:04.090]  Eastern Liberal Establishment was allowed in to join it and several of the other countries came in as lower echelon members.
[02:14:04.090 --> 02:14:11.013]  And this committee was begun actually by the drug trade with China.
[02:14:11.013 --> 02:14:13.454]  That's where they've amassed their fortunes.
[02:14:13.454 --> 02:14:15.155]  And that's where they got their beginning.
[02:14:15.155 --> 02:14:21.518]  But of course they've gone from that to every level of society, every facet of our civilization.
[02:14:22.347 --> 02:14:32.251]  And they have people who have introduced population control and a wide variety of devices to keep control of everything that's happening.
[02:14:32.251 --> 02:14:49.717]  Now you can say that this is like a huge corporation where you have the CEO at the head, you have his staff consisting of the senior managers, then you have the lower echelon managers, and then you have the subscribers, shareholders.
[02:14:50.379 --> 02:14:54.222]  And that's basically what this organization is like.
[02:14:54.222 --> 02:15:02.287]  It is a worldwide control body with enormous powers because it's invaded every government on the planet.
[02:15:02.287 --> 02:15:17.057]  There's not a single government, maybe with the exception of China, and latterly Russia, since the demise of their previous president and with the coming of Putin, of course, things changed in Russia.
[02:15:17.057 --> 02:15:18.958]  And this gives you some idea
[02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:43.304]  And by the way, you're a political scientist and economist, and I've read your work for more than 15 years, so I vouch for what you're saying, but perhaps you should give people a few dates, because you went and got source documents from the Office of Naval Intelligence, from retired admirals, from retired commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence.
[02:15:44.195 --> 02:16:05.247]  from government documents and explain when it got its name Committee of 300 and how it nexuses in with the Bilderberg Group, with the Roundtable, Royal Institute of International Affairs in England, with the CFR in the United States, how these other globalist groups tie in to the Committee of 300.
[02:16:06.147 --> 02:16:14.710]  Well, these two organizations that you mentioned, like the Burgers and the Council on Foreign Relations, these are mere cogs in the big machinery.
[02:16:14.710 --> 02:16:18.171]  They're not the preeminent bodies that we have to deal with.
[02:16:18.171 --> 02:16:21.532]  They are cogs in this giant organization called the Committee of 300.
[02:16:21.532 --> 02:16:31.876]  And they took this name from a family of 300 very powerful merchants living in England, and it began with a charter
[02:16:32.679 --> 02:16:38.960]  From the Queen to give them the right to go and invade countries and make war against them.
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:41.621]  And it all, of course, was based on the Chinese Okium trade.
[02:16:41.621 --> 02:16:47.382]  They had a huge treasury of money gained from the Chinese Okium trade.
[02:16:47.382 --> 02:16:52.403]  They even got a charter from the British government to go to war against China.
[02:16:52.403 --> 02:16:54.604]  That gives you some idea of the power of these people.
[02:16:55.501 --> 02:16:59.322]  It's like a private organization that really is the government of the world.
[02:16:59.322 --> 02:17:14.105]  And of course even MSNBC admits that in 1832, this same committee of opium merchants, British, Dutch, East India that had merged hundreds of years before, set up just skull and bones to take over the elite of the United States.
[02:17:14.105 --> 02:17:19.666]  So this is really the oldest continually operating private intelligence operation.
[02:17:20.166 --> 02:17:26.490]  Absolutely, and they co-opted the best available brains in the world at that time.
[02:17:26.490 --> 02:17:37.117]  And all the old liberal, eastern liberalist establishment families, like John Handyside Perkins and so on, they were all co-opted into this committee.
[02:17:37.117 --> 02:17:43.802]  And today the CFR takes its orders from the Royal Institute of International Affairs in Chatham House in London.
[02:17:44.409 --> 02:17:45.949]  That's a daily affair.
[02:17:45.949 --> 02:17:49.470]  The orders are relayed through one of the brokerage houses.
[02:17:49.470 --> 02:17:52.191]  I don't want to name them in case they file suit against me.
[02:17:52.191 --> 02:18:01.212]  But they are the ones who convey the message to the Secretary of State and then it becomes government policy.
[02:18:01.212 --> 02:18:13.975]  In foreign policy, monetary policy, in fact, very little that is enacted is not originally from the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which is the foreign, which is the international arm
[02:18:18.235 --> 02:18:26.556]  It's amazing, and of course they use the drug war as a way to break up China, and they're doing the same thing today here.
[02:18:26.556 --> 02:18:35.138]  They make the drugs illegal and then take over all the criminal networks and mass all the secret wealth through the drug war.
[02:18:35.138 --> 02:18:41.279]  Exactly, that's how they acquired their massive treasury, their amazing amount of wealth.
[02:18:43.050 --> 02:18:48.351]  The wealth of those people have made David Rockefeller look like a piper.
[02:18:48.351 --> 02:18:52.653]  Give you some idea of how wealthy they are.
[02:18:52.653 --> 02:18:55.913]  And he's just one of their agents here in the U.S., correct?
[02:18:55.913 --> 02:18:57.214]  That's correct.
[02:18:57.214 --> 02:18:58.314]  Oh yes.
[02:18:58.314 --> 02:19:01.715]  And of course I also believe that there are a few others in the U.S.
[02:19:01.715 --> 02:19:04.195]  agents as well.
[02:19:04.195 --> 02:19:06.636]  Herr Kissinger and Brzezinski are above them.
[02:19:07.361 --> 02:19:09.622]  Al Brzezinski played a big role.
[02:19:09.622 --> 02:19:16.526]  He was one of their Foreign Arms Specialists, and he wrote many of the policies for the U.S.
[02:19:16.526 --> 02:19:17.967]  that were carried out.
[02:19:17.967 --> 02:19:22.550]  And especially weak, I think, in this regard, was the Carter administration.
[02:19:22.550 --> 02:19:28.413]  They were like just servants to this committee and did exactly... James Earl Carter did exactly what he was told.
[02:19:28.413 --> 02:19:29.734]  He never deviated from that.
[02:19:31.257 --> 02:19:35.741]  Well, we've only got 40 minutes left, and it's clear I'm going to have to get you back up for two hours in the near future.
[02:19:35.741 --> 02:19:37.422]  Coleman300.com.
[02:19:37.422 --> 02:19:39.324]  A short segment coming up, then a long segment.
[02:19:39.324 --> 02:19:41.245]  I'm going to try to shut up when we get back.
[02:19:41.245 --> 02:19:42.946]  It's so intriguing.
[02:19:42.946 --> 02:19:53.895]  Go over your research of the Committee of 300, what their goals are, how they tie to these other groups that serve them, and where this is going in the future.
[02:19:53.895 --> 02:20:00.641]  With our guest, Dr. John Coleman, I'm Alex Jones, and of course we cover this group's eugenics aims in Endgame.
[02:20:01.530 --> 02:20:06.074]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.074 --> 02:20:06.995]  Number 1.
[02:20:06.995 --> 02:20:10.418]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.418 --> 02:20:11.278]  Number 2.
[02:20:11.278 --> 02:20:16.162]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:16.162 --> 02:20:16.903]  It's true.
[02:20:16.903 --> 02:20:21.787]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.787 --> 02:20:22.608]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.608 --> 02:20:26.191]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.191 --> 02:20:29.894]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.094 --> 02:20:30.895]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.895 --> 02:20:33.657]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.657 --> 02:20:37.340]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:38.120]  Number 5.
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:42.263]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.263 --> 02:20:47.027]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:21:05.851 --> 02:21:07.112]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:07.112 --> 02:21:10.836]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:10.836 --> 02:21:13.299]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:13.299 --> 02:21:19.165]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:19.165 --> 02:21:25.392]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:25.812 --> 02:21:31.797]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:31.797 --> 02:21:35.980]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:40.264]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:40.264 --> 02:21:46.209]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:46.209 --> 02:21:49.772]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:49.772 --> 02:21:51.733]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:51.733 --> 02:21:52.174]  It's here.

[02:23:00.706 --> 02:23:01.846]  Fatigue.
[02:23:01.846 --> 02:23:02.967]  Headaches.
[02:23:02.967 --> 02:23:04.307]  Allergies and asthma.
[02:23:04.307 --> 02:23:05.728]  Chronic disease.
[02:23:05.728 --> 02:23:07.588]  Is your home making you sick?
[02:23:07.588 --> 02:23:08.509]  Here's a fact.
[02:23:08.509 --> 02:23:16.492]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[02:23:16.492 --> 02:23:23.694]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.

[02:23:32.671 --> 02:23:33.111]  I think so.
[02:24:04.488 --> 02:24:10.481]  Now let's remember that 30 years ago the mainstream media said the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[02:24:10.481 --> 02:24:14.370]  But Dr. John Coleman from Deep Research has found the documents about the Committee of 300.
[02:24:15.888 --> 02:24:18.369]  The Bilderbergers was counted at a place called
[02:24:43.487 --> 02:24:56.892]  The Bilderberg is in Holland and it was under the control of the old Dutch prince and it was there that they had their first meeting in the town of Bilderberg.
[02:24:56.892 --> 02:24:58.453]  Yeah, Oosterbeek, Holland.
[02:24:58.453 --> 02:25:01.254]  But my question is, how does it tie in?
[02:25:01.254 --> 02:25:09.677]  Because then when you research Bilderberg, you find out it was a group that had been meeting for hundreds of years and just ties into the Dutch and German arm of this same committee.
[02:25:10.137 --> 02:25:18.142]  Yes, well what these people do, they take names that date back hundreds of years and then they go up those names for their societies today.
[02:25:18.142 --> 02:25:26.307]  And, uh, you know what you're looking at is a loosely knit group of people, as I said in my book, with commonly held goals.
[02:25:26.307 --> 02:25:32.171]  It's not a, it's not the case that some just group meetings socially.
[02:25:32.171 --> 02:25:34.753]  In fact, the Committee of 300 has 150 year old history.
[02:25:37.130 --> 02:25:37.930]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:45.074]  So when did you first discover the term Committee of 300 in the power structure, and what is their goal?
[02:25:45.074 --> 02:25:48.977]  Their goals are... They want to have an open... HG Wells, who was an earlier member of their elite coterie,
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:11.704]  He wrote a work called, The Open Conspiracy's Plan for a World Revolution.
[02:26:11.704 --> 02:26:18.369]  And it was a bold statement of intent, which nobody believed, of course.
[02:26:18.369 --> 02:26:26.355]  Welles accepted this, and he wrote the Conspiracy, and it says that, I'll quote you some of it, I can't do it all.
[02:26:26.355 --> 02:26:35.963]  The Open Conspiracy will appear first, I believe, as a conscious organization of intelligent, in some cases wealthy men, as a movement having
[02:26:36.491 --> 02:27:01.862]  Distinct social and political aims, complicitly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control, or using it only as an incidental implement in the stages, a mere movement of a number of people in a certain direction, prepared to discover, with a sort of surprise, the common object of which they are all moving, and all sorts of ways they will be influencing and controlling the governments of the world.
[02:27:01.862 --> 02:27:04.944]  And you know, George Orwell mentioned something about this in his book, 1984.
[02:27:06.829 --> 02:27:11.131]  So that's really what they plan to do.
[02:27:11.131 --> 02:27:12.611]  And I remember reading that H.G.
[02:27:12.611 --> 02:27:24.275]  Wells quote because he wanted this global world government and talked about how they would exterminate most of the people and of course he was one of their top thinkers, but that particular quote you just gave, where does that come from again?
[02:27:24.275 --> 02:27:29.037]  That comes from his paper, I'll read it to you.
[02:27:29.037 --> 02:27:33.659]  The Open Conspiracy, Planned for a World Revolution.
[02:27:33.659 --> 02:27:34.399]  That's what it's called.
[02:27:35.276 --> 02:27:40.439]  Yeah, plans for a world revolution.
[02:27:40.439 --> 02:27:42.881]  We've got to do another paper on that.
[02:27:42.881 --> 02:27:50.405]  I found this document in the British Museum in London, which is one of the greatest repositories of information in the world.
[02:27:50.405 --> 02:27:55.608]  I was privileged, of course, having special access to certain areas that are closed to the public.
[02:27:55.608 --> 02:27:59.951]  But that's where I found most of this work that I've written about.
[02:28:01.889 --> 02:28:05.570]  Well, he was quite open about a lot of it in books like The New World Order.
[02:28:05.570 --> 02:28:07.570]  Oh yes, he was.
[02:28:07.570 --> 02:28:14.351]  But I mean, what I'm talking about is the formation of it in the beginning was kept very secret.
[02:28:14.351 --> 02:28:17.352]  And of course, Cecil Rhodes tied into this, didn't he?
[02:28:17.352 --> 02:28:22.572]  Oh yes, he was financed by the Lord Alfred Milner.
[02:28:22.572 --> 02:28:29.874]  Lord Alfred Milner was an autocrat who'd made huge fortunes in Russia.
[02:28:29.874 --> 02:28:31.634]  And he sent Rhodes out, actually,
[02:28:32.375 --> 02:28:40.141]  to South Africa to gain control of the enormous wealth of diamonds and gold, which had just been discovered there.
[02:28:40.141 --> 02:28:46.925]  And Rhodes put unlimited money behind and went around buying up all the claims of the prospectors.
[02:28:46.925 --> 02:28:49.787]  There's really no mining of any kind going on.
[02:28:49.787 --> 02:28:59.194]  And from that small beginning, and they still have this all centred in the City of London, which is a private preserve, financial preserve of the Committee of 300.
[02:28:59.194 --> 02:29:01.796]  The City of London is totally indifferent from
[02:29:02.381 --> 02:29:24.818]  London itself, it's a financial center and Rhodes was of course set up with unlimited money and he bought up most of the claims of the small miners and when the opportunities came to start mining on a big scale they were there and waiting and had all the appropriate wealth to back it up and today of course the mines in South Africa are the biggest in the world.
[02:29:24.818 --> 02:29:28.401]  They have a gold seam that stretches for 200 miles east to west
[02:29:29.221 --> 02:29:31.523]  And it's not just some small cup of nuggets.
[02:29:31.523 --> 02:29:32.603]  I've been down those mines.
[02:29:32.603 --> 02:29:37.146]  We've got down 6,000 people in a cage that drops like a stone.
[02:29:37.146 --> 02:29:40.288]  And if you don't have a strong stomach, don't try it.
[02:29:40.288 --> 02:29:48.754]  And you get down to these places where they're working, the cases, and they sell enormous, 20-foot tires.
[02:29:48.754 --> 02:29:49.875]  Stay there, stay there, Doctor.
[02:29:49.875 --> 02:29:51.716]  We're gonna come right back to you.
[02:29:51.716 --> 02:29:53.097]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.097 --> 02:29:55.639]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.639 --> 02:29:58.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.058 --> 02:30:06.021]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:06.021 --> 02:30:07.022]  What have we got?
[02:30:07.022 --> 02:30:09.463]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:09.463 --> 02:30:10.464]  A republic.
[02:30:10.464 --> 02:30:13.126]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:13.126 --> 02:30:15.387]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:30:15.387 --> 02:30:17.408]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:17.408 --> 02:30:19.089]  So they think they own our land?
[02:30:19.089 --> 02:30:20.410]  They think they own our water?
[02:30:20.410 --> 02:30:21.010]  Children?
[02:30:21.010 --> 02:30:22.131]  Our education?
[02:30:22.131 --> 02:30:22.972]  Our money?
[02:30:22.972 --> 02:30:26.614]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:26.974 --> 02:30:30.659]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:30:30.659 --> 02:30:31.961]  You are being warned.
[02:30:31.961 --> 02:30:32.982]  We have the facts.
[02:30:32.982 --> 02:30:34.144]  We have the Constitution.
[02:30:34.144 --> 02:30:35.045]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:35.045 --> 02:30:35.946]  We have common law.
[02:30:35.946 --> 02:30:38.450]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:38.450 --> 02:30:42.235]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:30:42.335 --> 02:30:47.302]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:30:47.302 --> 02:30:48.783]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:30:48.783 --> 02:30:49.885]  Don't tread on me.
[02:30:49.885 --> 02:30:56.774]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:31:00.939 --> 02:31:05.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:11.522]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:11.522 --> 02:31:18.905]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:18.905 --> 02:31:23.786]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:31:23.786 --> 02:31:25.267]  Get a free, detailed catalog.
[02:31:25.467 --> 02:31:27.187]  It's powder and owner for over 63 years.
[02:31:27.187 --> 02:31:28.748]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[02:31:28.748 --> 02:31:31.388]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:31:31.388 --> 02:31:31.788]  Call us!
[02:31:48.232 --> 02:31:54.796]  At 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:31:54.796 --> 02:31:55.236]  Thank you!
[02:32:01.940 --> 02:32:10.426]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[02:32:10.426 --> 02:32:21.315]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[02:32:21.315 --> 02:32:26.759]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[02:32:27.319 --> 02:32:32.202]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[02:32:32.202 --> 02:32:41.268]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[02:32:41.268 --> 02:32:51.375]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[02:32:51.375 --> 02:32:56.078]  That's www.SilverLungs.com SilverLungs.com
[02:33:21.297 --> 02:33:25.885]  Well I tell ya, ten years ago you never saw news headlines about the Bilderberg Group.
[02:33:25.885 --> 02:33:27.348]  Here's the Times of London.
[02:33:27.348 --> 02:33:29.832]  Secretive Bilderberg Club ready for protest.
[02:33:31.601 --> 02:33:38.322]  And it's a high-powered meeting of Committee of 300 members, but it's not as secretive as the overall Committee of 300.
[02:33:38.322 --> 02:33:48.084]  And I've researched this, and our guest is dead on and has the documents, and he has the book, which you could call the Bible of conspiracy theories, but it's not theories, it's fact.
[02:33:48.084 --> 02:33:49.565]  And of course, that's the Committee of 300.
[02:33:49.565 --> 02:33:59.327]  Coleman300.com is the website, and we cover their endgame eugenics agenda, and of course my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:33:59.327 --> 02:34:00.447]  And folks, this isn't a joke.
[02:34:01.147 --> 02:34:14.380]  You know, they stalled you and said there's no secret groups, there's no world government, there's no derivatives, the bankers aren't engaged in fractional reserve banking, the government's not shipping in narcotics, everything's fine, go back to sleep.
[02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:17.663]  Now they admit all that's happening, but saying it's good.
[02:34:17.663 --> 02:34:21.367]  Fox TV says we're growing opium, it's good.
[02:34:21.367 --> 02:34:23.309]  Yes, world government's real, but it's good.
[02:34:24.807 --> 02:34:32.934]  Well, from my research, this ends with an authoritarian world government with one-child policy at the bare minimum.
[02:34:32.934 --> 02:34:41.622]  Now, you were finishing up, going down the diamond mines, and of course the De Beers Oppenheimer Global Diamond Monopoly set up by the Milner Group.
[02:34:41.622 --> 02:34:44.765]  I've read documents from Milner at the end of World War I in 1919.
[02:34:44.765 --> 02:34:45.245]  These are public.
[02:34:48.610 --> 02:34:53.673]  Saying we've got to get some type of thug dictator in in Germany and set them up for the next war.
[02:34:53.673 --> 02:34:56.955]  I mean, that's the wide-reaching, long-term view.
[02:34:56.955 --> 02:35:06.582]  So they get Wall Street and the general public in a quarterly mindset, only thinking about the present and profits now, but they're all positioned for the long-term win.
[02:35:07.342 --> 02:35:13.892]  Okay, and we get so many intellectuals on here and researchers who say, oh no, the elite are short-sighted.
[02:35:13.892 --> 02:35:19.781]  But when you look at their long-term plans, their admitted Ford Foundation operations, Brzezinski's 25- and 50-year plans, no!
[02:35:22.725 --> 02:35:28.086]  Of course, the political science head at Georgetown, Carol Quigley, he says 30-year, 50-year plans.
[02:35:28.086 --> 02:35:36.008]  So no, it is quarter-century timeframe, bare minimum, as Aldous Huxley, part of these elite families, wrote.
[02:35:36.008 --> 02:35:38.509]  In 1933, it's all coming true.
[02:35:38.509 --> 02:35:43.390]  So going back to Dr. Coleman, what is their endgame then?
[02:35:43.390 --> 02:35:45.090]  What is their final agenda?
[02:35:45.090 --> 02:35:49.171]  Should we be concerned about these autocrats running everything?
[02:35:49.875 --> 02:35:51.575]  We should be very concerned.
[02:35:51.575 --> 02:35:56.357]  If we want to keep our republic, and the United States is not a democracy, it's a republic.
[02:35:56.357 --> 02:35:58.097]  Let me make that clear.
[02:35:58.097 --> 02:36:03.638]  You cannot have a democracy in a confederated republic.
[02:36:03.638 --> 02:36:09.380]  Our principles may be democratic, but our actual form of government is republican.
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:11.560]  That should settle that question.
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:17.722]  And of course we ought to be concerned, because here you have an organization that's permeated every strata of our society into
[02:36:18.959 --> 02:36:19.399]  We're good to go.
[02:36:42.586 --> 02:36:45.329]  In 1972, they told me to go and hang myself.
[02:36:45.329 --> 02:36:47.450]  It did all kinds of nasty things to me.
[02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:53.716]  But if you look back at my record, you'll find that I've made over 500 predictions.
[02:36:53.716 --> 02:37:03.364]  I hate to use the word, but I said these things were going to happen in the future, and I think that most of them, we went through them just the other day, and most of them
[02:37:04.551 --> 02:37:08.913]  I've come to pass, so I think I've got a fairly good record as far as... Yes, that's right.
[02:37:23.401 --> 02:37:36.949]  And of course, would you agree with some of the other historians we've had on that this ties into England, Germany, the Dutch, but also the model that the British picked up out of some of the Italian families?
[02:37:36.949 --> 02:37:38.190]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:37:38.190 --> 02:37:45.554]  The Italian families like the Bernatis, they were the model of this organization, and most of these people
[02:37:46.064 --> 02:37:59.290]  The old Florentine and Venetian Black Nobility, they were not black, their skins weren't black, but they were known as Black Nobility by the people of the city because their deeds were so evil that they could not stand the light of day.
[02:37:59.290 --> 02:38:04.352]  And they didn't take too much trouble to hide them either, that's why they called them the Black Nobility.
[02:38:04.352 --> 02:38:07.614]  And you know, that's the dynasty that Queen Victoria of England sprang from.
[02:38:07.614 --> 02:38:14.237]  So to give you some idea just how big these organizations have grown.
[02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:25.340]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of people now that are out there that have basically taken your work on the Black Nobility and basically declared it as their own.
[02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:29.663]  But that's the greatest form of flattery, is imitation.
[02:38:29.663 --> 02:38:36.187]  I know that, and I think my work might well be in the United States anyway.
[02:38:36.187 --> 02:38:43.392]  This type of information, the most plagiarized of all books of the conspiracy theories.
[02:38:43.392 --> 02:38:45.634]  But that's alright, as long as we get the news out there.
[02:38:46.462 --> 02:38:47.422]  That's the main thing.
[02:38:47.422 --> 02:38:48.122]  Well, they have been uncovered.
[02:38:48.122 --> 02:38:48.803]  That's the whole thing.
[02:38:48.803 --> 02:38:49.983]  That's not something they bargained for.
[02:39:16.027 --> 02:39:19.430]  They certainly didn't bargain for that at all.
[02:39:19.430 --> 02:39:23.793]  It strives, as I said, for a one world government.
[02:39:23.793 --> 02:39:25.975]  A new world order inside a one world government.
[02:39:25.975 --> 02:39:27.616]  That's the ultimate.
[02:39:27.616 --> 02:39:35.822]  Where you have a few people at the very top, and you have the middle management, and then you have the lower management, and then you have what's called the masses.
[02:39:35.822 --> 02:39:38.304]  That's us, that's me, that's you.
[02:39:38.304 --> 02:39:43.008]  We are destined to be controlled through population control, various measures.
[02:39:44.336 --> 02:39:47.538]  Worldwide disease and wars.
[02:39:47.538 --> 02:39:52.522]  But Bertrand Russell, a senior statesman, once said that wars seem to have been disappointing.
[02:39:52.522 --> 02:39:54.483]  They haven't killed enough people.
[02:39:54.483 --> 02:40:05.931]  So what he said, we need to reintroduce periodically plagues like the Black Plague, where millions of people get wiped out until we get to our optimum size population.
[02:40:05.931 --> 02:40:08.473]  These are the things that are very, very real.
[02:40:08.473 --> 02:40:10.915]  They're not the pigments of my imagination, believe me.
[02:40:13.021 --> 02:40:19.424]  No, I've read, I've actually got the Merchant Russell books where he talks about that, and then he's hailed as a liberal!
[02:40:19.424 --> 02:40:29.848]  And he talks about the scientific dictatorship where a revolt of the commoners will be as impossible as a revolt of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[02:40:29.848 --> 02:40:35.610]  Exactly, that's exactly what the intention was.
[02:40:35.610 --> 02:40:41.413]  And you know, I had to bring Hitler into the thing, but Hitler's misdetermined eugenics program was actually
[02:40:42.242 --> 02:40:47.544]  Started in America by the mother of the late Admiral Harriman.
[02:40:47.544 --> 02:40:51.125]  She had a eugenic society based in Upper New York State.
[02:40:51.125 --> 02:41:06.649]  And she had a huge meeting in 19, uh, when I think it was about 1921, I'm not sure of the date, of the eugenic societies and a lot of German dignitaries came and that's actually where Hitler got his extermination policies.
[02:41:06.994 --> 02:41:11.838]  Well, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was fully bankrolled by the Rockefeller family on record.
[02:41:11.838 --> 02:41:15.360]  Absolutely correct.
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:20.805]  Let me throw this curveball in because, you know, there's big debates on the internet by people that don't do research.
[02:41:20.805 --> 02:41:33.755]  I understand it's an imperial, corporate, letter-of-mark, you know, commerce system, and that's how the globalists describe themselves, because I actually read their documents like you do, but there's this obsession with
[02:41:34.315 --> 02:41:38.578]  It's Catholics that run it all, or it's Jews that run it all, or it's this group.
[02:41:38.578 --> 02:41:50.066]  But when you look at it, it doesn't matter if it's Jews, Protestants, Catholics, Hindus, Japanese, Chinese, the top families are all part of this power structure and all push for the same thing.
[02:41:50.066 --> 02:42:01.593]  And I see it as very destructive, but I see this major eugenics, I don't want to say Nazi, because as you mentioned, it was just an off growth of this, this scientific dictatorship, eugenics movement is at the heart of it.
[02:42:01.593 --> 02:42:02.774]  That's what it's all about.
[02:42:02.774 --> 02:42:03.575]  A super race.
[02:42:04.315 --> 02:42:09.818]  And then you have this big movement that, no, it's Rothschilds, it's Jews, they run it all.
[02:42:09.818 --> 02:42:16.281]  And then you do see powerful Jewish families supporting the eugenics movement, even though they get stung by it.
[02:42:16.281 --> 02:42:22.345]  So this is a very, I don't want to call it Nazi death cult, because, again, it predates that.
[02:42:22.345 --> 02:42:26.367]  So what is the main power makeup of the New World Order?
[02:42:27.421 --> 02:42:30.983]  Well, it's a one world government.
[02:42:30.983 --> 02:42:46.430]  A one world government composed of the members of the Committee of 300 inside a New World Order where they propose to change every government in the world and make it submit to this New World Order government and that's the one world government.
[02:42:46.430 --> 02:42:47.951]  That's exactly what they're trying to do.
[02:42:50.879 --> 02:42:53.761]  They just want to have countries like the United States and China.
[02:42:53.761 --> 02:43:01.587]  They want a one world government where loyalty to nationality will no longer be an issue.
[02:43:01.587 --> 02:43:04.669]  And so it's not, from your research, a racial conspiracy.
[02:43:04.669 --> 02:43:05.390]  It's an idea.
[02:43:05.390 --> 02:43:06.571]  It's an idea.
[02:43:06.571 --> 02:43:10.294]  It's an idea that they said has come.
[02:43:10.294 --> 02:43:11.635]  Time has come.
[02:43:11.635 --> 02:43:15.418]  And they're running behind their timetable because they've been thought of opposition.
[02:43:15.418 --> 02:43:17.179]  For instance, Stalin.
[02:43:17.179 --> 02:43:18.360]  As bad a guy as he was.
[02:43:19.557 --> 02:43:20.518]  He had his good points.
[02:43:20.518 --> 02:43:22.119]  He threw a spanner in the works of this.
[02:43:22.119 --> 02:43:29.727]  He said, I'm not going to be beheld in a great country like Russia to a bunch of cosmopolitans meeting in New York.
[02:43:29.727 --> 02:43:31.468]  And he said, we'll fight them to the end.
[02:43:31.468 --> 02:43:32.850]  And that's exactly what he did.
[02:43:32.850 --> 02:43:39.296]  And of course, Russia today is still a thorn in the side of the flesh of this organization because they have not joined it.
[02:43:39.296 --> 02:43:44.561]  In spite of the pressure to wreck the economy, which very little succeeded at one stage, but
[02:43:45.191 --> 02:43:49.875]  Thanks to Putin coming in, they managed to pull themselves around.
[02:43:49.875 --> 02:43:53.439]  And you can know that they're the best, best natural resources.
[02:43:53.439 --> 02:43:56.641]  Russia should be one of the greatest countries in the world.
[02:43:56.641 --> 02:44:01.406]  But they've been robbed blind by people in the past, these enormous, powerful combines.
[02:44:02.796 --> 02:44:20.868]  Well, I mean, specifically from my research, when the globalist puppet was kicked out, then you got the drunken semi-puppet who was then replaced by his Vice President Putin.
[02:44:20.868 --> 02:44:26.092]  So Boris Yeltsin, from my research, was a puppet, did let the banking oligarchs come in and take over.
[02:44:26.092 --> 02:44:28.133]  He did.
[02:44:28.133 --> 02:44:31.795]  But then Putin kicked them out of the nation.
[02:44:33.316 --> 02:44:34.497]  That's what he did.
[02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:37.018]  Yes, that's exactly what happened.
[02:44:37.018 --> 02:44:54.744]  Yeltsin was a drunken puppet and he lived in a fog of alcoholic haze all of his life, his adult life anyway, and Russia was teetering on the very very brink when Putin came to power and he cancelled all his monopolies and all of these international bankers fled.
[02:44:54.744 --> 02:44:58.846]  Many of them fled to England, most of them went to Israel and
[02:45:00.270 --> 02:45:04.472]  Berezovsky is the big man in England who runs the show there.
[02:45:04.472 --> 02:45:07.834]  He owns football clubs and enormous property holdings.
[02:45:07.834 --> 02:45:09.696]  He's an extremely wealthy man.
[02:45:09.696 --> 02:45:17.240]  And the Russians have asked for people before me to extradite him to Russia, and they refused to do so.
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:22.363]  You know, you'd think for all of Russia's power, they could do something about Mr. Berezovsky.
[02:45:22.363 --> 02:45:26.786]  Well, they did go over and assassinate one guy who was close to him.
[02:45:26.786 --> 02:45:29.007]  They poisoned him with plutonium, a terrible death.
[02:45:29.833 --> 02:45:31.894]  But they've not been able to get near to him.
[02:45:31.894 --> 02:45:34.715]  He lives in a guarded compound.
[02:45:34.715 --> 02:45:38.877]  And he never goes around except with about 10 or 12 bodyguards.
[02:45:38.877 --> 02:45:47.882]  And usually, Russia does not like to commit atrocities in public if they're going to assassinate a guy done in secret.
[02:45:47.882 --> 02:45:52.784]  And I spoke to one of the Russian generals myself once.
[02:45:52.784 --> 02:45:54.785]  He didn't want to say too much about it.
[02:45:54.785 --> 02:45:57.166]  He said, but they don't believe in making a spectacle.
[02:45:57.924 --> 02:46:03.066]  When they want to get rid of somebody.
[02:46:03.066 --> 02:46:07.827]  Though the Committee of 300 does like to make a spectacle, I've noticed.
[02:46:07.827 --> 02:46:08.828]  Oh yes, it does.
[02:46:08.828 --> 02:46:14.670]  But as I said, Russia's been on the forward and the side of the Committee of 300 for many, many years.
[02:46:14.670 --> 02:46:19.771]  From Stalin's days, they refused to obey the dictates of the Committee.
[02:46:19.771 --> 02:46:23.913]  And it cost them dearly.
[02:46:23.913 --> 02:46:27.374]  You know, it's interesting, Albert Gore's been in the news lately.
[02:46:28.567 --> 02:46:41.137]  And his father actually got many of the confessions that were given out by Elton, and uh, grew extremely rich from that.
[02:46:41.137 --> 02:46:42.899]  It's amazing.
[02:46:42.899 --> 02:46:49.805]  Now, again, going back to Russia, this has got to be upsetting, the New World Order clan.
[02:46:49.805 --> 02:46:52.247]  Now, for my research though, the committee did help
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:47:00.424]  Knock off their cousin, the Tsar, and did help put the Bolsheviks in, or is that incorrect from your research?
[02:47:00.424 --> 02:47:01.865]  No, that's absolutely correct.
[02:47:01.865 --> 02:47:03.466]  They did do that.
[02:47:03.466 --> 02:47:12.731]  They did get rid of the royal family of the Tsars, because the Tsars were trying to Christianize Russia, and that they didn't want.
[02:47:12.731 --> 02:47:20.676]  They wanted a nation of non-Christian people, so that they could easily get in and
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:24.041]  Completely compromised the whole situation.
[02:47:24.041 --> 02:47:32.243]  Because they found that statistically real Christians will create amazing independent local wealth and strong families, correct?
[02:47:32.243 --> 02:47:34.544]  That's exactly why they want to get rid of them.
[02:47:34.544 --> 02:47:39.806]  And if you notice that all of the Bolshevik leaders were actually non-Russian people.
[02:47:39.806 --> 02:47:41.466]  Every one of them.
[02:47:41.466 --> 02:47:45.968]  All the people who fomented the Bolshevik Revolution were non-Russian nationals.
[02:47:45.968 --> 02:47:49.569]  In other words, they were not... They were born in Russia, but they were
[02:47:50.461 --> 02:47:53.114]  They were to speak Russian, but they were not of the soil of Russia.
[02:47:53.114 --> 02:47:54.199]  They were not actually Russian.
[02:47:55.839 --> 02:48:00.521]  All right, shifting gears yet again in the time we've got, and I want to get you back up in the next few weeks.
[02:48:00.521 --> 02:48:04.042]  I don't know how it's been years, years, I think eight years since we've had you on.
[02:48:04.042 --> 02:48:05.463]  I've tried.
[02:48:05.463 --> 02:48:17.607]  You just blink and decades flash past, but in the time we've got left, you do concur with many of the other experts we have on and the Globalist on statements that they're in trouble.
[02:48:17.607 --> 02:48:23.710]  How much trouble from your expert analysis are they in, and what are you concerned about being their next move?
[02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:32.827]  The next move, I'm afraid of being concerned that they will try to bring in totalitarian government in through the back door.
[02:48:32.827 --> 02:48:44.837]  And if you look at many of the bills and measures that Obama has passed, there's a smack of socialism to a degree I've never seen before in American politics.
[02:48:44.837 --> 02:48:48.981]  And this is the kind of sneaky backdoor entrance that they hope to make.
[02:48:48.981 --> 02:48:50.042]  An alert populace.
[02:48:52.628 --> 02:48:57.589]  We'll resist whatever is trying to upset their way of life.
[02:48:57.589 --> 02:49:05.111]  But the sleeping giants like the American people would not easily stop this.
[02:49:05.111 --> 02:49:08.913]  So they're trying to lull them into a false sense of security.
[02:49:08.913 --> 02:49:21.456]  And I think that the pronouncements and the measures that have been passed by the Obama administration are the most socialistic I've ever encountered in America's history.
[02:49:23.206 --> 02:49:27.228]  Well, we're seeing open pushes to shut down free speech.
[02:49:27.228 --> 02:49:34.091]  We're seeing naked body scanners where they admit they record your naked body now to break our will.
[02:49:34.091 --> 02:49:36.132]  The paramilitarization of police.
[02:49:36.132 --> 02:49:38.653]  The open federalization of police.
[02:49:38.653 --> 02:49:42.114]  All these leaders pushing for the secret arrest of citizens.
[02:49:42.114 --> 02:49:44.695]  The extrajudicial stripping of our citizenship.
[02:49:44.695 --> 02:49:45.596]  I mean, that's 110% bona fide tyranny.
[02:49:48.857 --> 02:49:49.757]  It is.
[02:49:49.757 --> 02:49:55.738]  But you see, what they are striving to do is to abolish the Constitution altogether.
[02:49:55.738 --> 02:50:03.300]  But if they can't do that in one fell swoop, then what they're trying to do is abolish the state right to the 10th Amendment.
[02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:12.161]  And they think that this way, people will be much less powerful, and they'll be much more vulnerable for a takeover.
[02:50:12.161 --> 02:50:16.902]  And if you look at all the measures that have been aimed against state government, it's very, very alarming.
[02:50:17.622 --> 02:50:22.783]  Well, it's all designed to bankrupt them and turn them into vassal serfs who are going to break.
[02:50:22.783 --> 02:50:31.665]  That's why it's so important people get the film Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic with myself, Michael Magneric, Richard Mack, Charles Key, Cynthia Davis, Edwin Vieira, and others.
[02:50:31.665 --> 02:50:34.926]  This will teach you the difference between a republic and a democracy.
[02:50:34.926 --> 02:50:38.447]  This will show you how we get sheriffs selected, how we take the states back.
[02:50:39.627 --> 02:50:45.170]  As Victor Hugo said, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[02:50:45.170 --> 02:50:48.451]  If you will simply carry the ball, folks, we are unstoppable.

[02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:05.091]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:51:05.091 --> 02:51:07.391]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:51:07.391 --> 02:51:08.251]  Don't!
[02:51:08.251 --> 02:51:11.692]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:51:11.692 --> 02:51:18.814]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:51:18.794 --> 02:51:20.774]  's number one debt secret.

[02:51:35.368 --> 02:51:36.569]  Herb K was right.
[02:51:36.569 --> 02:51:39.613]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:51:39.773 --> 02:51:41.194]  What have you got to lose?

[02:51:48.921 --> 02:51:48.961]  800-822-1291.
[02:52:01.385 --> 02:52:06.347]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.347 --> 02:52:07.348]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.348 --> 02:52:09.789]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.789 --> 02:52:10.809]  A republic.
[02:52:10.809 --> 02:52:13.450]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.450 --> 02:52:15.711]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.711 --> 02:52:17.732]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.732 --> 02:52:19.413]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.413 --> 02:52:20.733]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.733 --> 02:52:21.334]  Children?
[02:52:21.334 --> 02:52:22.454]  Our education?
[02:52:22.454 --> 02:52:23.294]  Our money?
[02:52:23.294 --> 02:52:26.936]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.316 --> 02:52:31.002]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:31.002 --> 02:52:32.284]  You are being warned.
[02:52:32.284 --> 02:52:33.305]  We have the facts.
[02:52:33.305 --> 02:52:34.467]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.467 --> 02:52:35.388]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.388 --> 02:52:36.270]  We have common law.
[02:52:36.270 --> 02:52:38.793]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:53:53.268 --> 02:53:54.189]  For the rest of your life.
[02:54:05.151 --> 02:54:07.294]  You know, I've said it many times, I'll say it again.
[02:54:07.294 --> 02:54:11.020]  I'm not your slave, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:12.623]  I'm not the slave of the New World Order.
[02:54:12.623 --> 02:54:16.508]  We all need to basically declare that information publicly.
[02:54:18.084 --> 02:54:20.745]  Dr. John Coleman is our guest.
[02:54:20.745 --> 02:54:21.645]  This isn't a game.
[02:54:21.645 --> 02:54:22.545]  It's not a joke.
[02:54:22.545 --> 02:54:24.825]  It's not a drill.
[02:54:24.825 --> 02:54:26.146]  There is a world government.
[02:54:26.146 --> 02:54:27.166]  It's out in the open.
[02:54:27.166 --> 02:54:28.886]  The denial is over.
[02:54:28.886 --> 02:54:33.027]  We are going into high-tech slavery unless we turn this around.
[02:54:33.027 --> 02:54:42.129]  And the way these controllers get away with this is they have so many dumbed-down minions that serve them in compartmentalized positions who feel like they're part of the winning team.
[02:54:42.129 --> 02:54:43.609]  But this oppressive system
[02:54:44.409 --> 02:54:44.890]  I do, absolutely.
[02:54:44.890 --> 02:54:46.211]  That's only the beginning of the nightmare.
[02:55:02.915 --> 02:55:04.535]  The nightmare will be that you will have no more rights of any kind.
[02:55:04.535 --> 02:55:05.636]  You'll be told exactly what to do, when to do.
[02:55:05.636 --> 02:55:08.796]  You'll be told what type of employment you can have or not have.
[02:55:08.796 --> 02:55:10.417]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:55:31.656 --> 02:55:40.239]  In other words, every individual in the United States will be fully controlled and told exactly what he can and cannot do.
[02:55:40.239 --> 02:55:48.461]  Yeah, I saw Bill Gates a few weeks ago bragging that he loves China because they're now deciding what children will be off of their DNA.
[02:55:48.461 --> 02:55:53.963]  But of course, in the state can claim whatever they want and say that your DNA shows this or that.
[02:55:53.963 --> 02:55:55.363]  I mean, this is total control.
[02:55:55.363 --> 02:56:00.505]  This is them taking control of the human species, of our evolutionary development.
[02:56:01.533 --> 02:56:03.034]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[02:56:03.034 --> 02:56:07.357]  They've always said that man is nothing more than a mind and matter.
[02:56:07.357 --> 02:56:17.305]  He's not an intelligent being even and he is born to be controlled and we're the people who are going to do the controlling.
[02:56:17.305 --> 02:56:22.408]  So, that's more or less the situation with them.
[02:56:22.408 --> 02:56:25.831]  But we can take heart though in the awakening.
[02:56:25.831 --> 02:56:28.593]  Are they concerned about the awakening that's happening, Doctor?
[02:56:31.598 --> 02:56:34.004]  Excuse me a minute, there's another phone ringing in my office.
[02:56:34.004 --> 02:56:35.066]  I'm trying to disconnect it.
[02:56:35.888 --> 02:56:36.769]  All right, I understand.
[02:56:36.769 --> 02:56:47.497]  I think we're going to have him back up with us next week, or not next week, the Monday following next week, about 10-11 days from now for a Part 2 interview.
[02:56:47.497 --> 02:57:01.107]  So many great patriots out there, and I remember over a decade ago reading his book and learning so much, and since then, you know, I've done my own research separately into many areas and just continue to realize how groundbreaking this information is, but
[02:57:01.847 --> 02:57:09.589]  For those that just joined us, it's so important for people to see the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, so they understand the agenda we're facing.
[02:57:09.589 --> 02:57:17.951]  Sir, you were finishing up with commenting on the fact that they've been exposed and they are concerned.
[02:57:17.951 --> 02:57:19.771]  How concerned are they?
[02:57:19.771 --> 02:57:25.473]  They're pretty concerned because you've got... You know, Stalin knew about this going to happen a long time ago.
[02:57:25.473 --> 02:57:29.994]  That's why he demanded to get the atom bomb from the United States.
[02:57:30.839 --> 02:57:41.041]  Because he said he didn't tell his friends, Roosevelt and company, what he wanted them for, but he said that this would definitely be needed for him to cooperate with them.
[02:57:41.041 --> 02:57:51.683]  He wanted, said, to defend Russia, but he really was going to defend Russia against the New World Order, and he did not wish the people in Russia to be subject to that.
[02:57:51.683 --> 02:57:52.924]  So he wasn't all bad.
[02:57:52.924 --> 02:57:54.344]  Of course, he wasn't really a Russian.
[02:57:54.344 --> 02:57:56.004]  He was a Georgian.
[02:57:56.004 --> 02:57:58.565]  But that is basically
[02:57:59.255 --> 02:58:03.957]  The intent to enslave everybody in a new world order, one world government system.
[02:58:03.957 --> 02:58:13.601]  Now it sounds very far-fetched, but there's a great deal of logic behind it, and there's a great deal of information that I was managed, I managed on Earth.
[02:58:13.601 --> 02:58:15.882]  Well, sir, you've been talking about this for decades.
[02:58:15.882 --> 02:58:17.383]  Now it's out in the open.
[02:58:17.383 --> 02:58:18.264]  It is H.G.
[02:58:18.264 --> 02:58:20.084]  Wells' open conspiracy.
[02:58:20.084 --> 02:58:20.745]  It is now.
[02:58:20.745 --> 02:58:21.185]  It is now.
[02:58:21.185 --> 02:58:25.967]  And as I was saying in the beginning, people said I was off the wall and I belonged in a lunatic asylum.
[02:58:25.967 --> 02:58:27.808]  I had many insults hurled at me.
[02:58:28.718 --> 02:58:29.739]  I'd be better.
[02:58:29.739 --> 02:58:34.642]  Many bad phone calls telling me to go retire somewhere.
[02:58:34.642 --> 02:58:39.065]  And we've gone from almost no one knowing about this to the whole world being awake.
[02:58:39.065 --> 02:58:39.805]  God bless you, sir.
[02:58:39.805 --> 02:58:41.646]  We'll talk to you in a week and a half.
[02:58:41.646 --> 02:58:47.390]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.390 --> 02:58:50.592]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.112 --> 02:58:52.413]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.413 --> 02:58:58.017]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.017 --> 02:59:03.021]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:03.021 --> 02:59:03.501]  It's true.
[02:59:03.501 --> 02:59:08.065]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:08.585 --> 02:59:13.829]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:13.829 --> 02:59:16.130]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:59:16.130 --> 02:59:20.933]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:20.933 --> 02:59:22.054]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:22.054 --> 02:59:25.136]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:59:25.136 --> 02:59:28.739]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:28.739 --> 02:59:31.941]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:31.941 --> 02:59:34.162]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:34.162 --> 02:59:35.083]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:38.806 --> 02:59:42.950]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:47.794]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:47.794 --> 02:59:54.281]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:54.281 --> 02:59:56.683]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.683 --> 02:59:59.446]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:15.157 --> 03:00:20.539]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into this fourth and final hour.
[03:00:20.539 --> 03:00:34.043]  We have a guest joining us, Charlie Skelton, writer for the Evening Standard and the London Guardian, from Spain, at the 2010 Global Government Conference, the Bilderberg Group Conference that kicks off tomorrow.
[03:00:34.043 --> 03:00:38.644]  They've already closed the hotel and globalists are arriving.
[03:00:38.644 --> 03:00:41.125]  And here's the headline, our man at Bilderberg, 2010.
[03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:54.937]  So that is coming up in about 30 minutes with that information.
[03:00:54.937 --> 03:00:59.460]  Now, for the first half of this hour, I want to get Paul Joseph Watson on.
[03:00:59.460 --> 03:01:08.027]  I wrote the article last week for PrisonPlanet.com dealing with the Open Conspiracy, the Bilderberg Group.
[03:01:08.027 --> 03:01:09.088]  And this is a big deal.
[03:01:10.387 --> 03:01:17.176]  They psychologically for the last half century told you there's no world government, no banking elite, no such thing as fractional reserve banking.
[03:01:17.176 --> 03:01:18.437]  The Federal Reserve is federal.
[03:01:19.471 --> 03:01:20.812]  Just forget about it.
[03:01:20.812 --> 03:01:22.373]  Now they've engineered a global collapse.
[03:01:22.373 --> 03:01:24.815]  They're bringing in world government.
[03:01:24.815 --> 03:01:30.439]  They're preparing to plunge the dollar and the euro even more, openly announcing world government.
[03:01:30.439 --> 03:01:33.541]  But all the yuppies have been told it doesn't exist.
[03:01:33.541 --> 03:01:37.965]  So even when the news admits world government's here, the yuppie says, well, I'm a winner.
[03:01:37.965 --> 03:01:40.346]  And winners don't recognize that exist.
[03:01:40.346 --> 03:01:44.549]  So I'm going to let the government take my job and my pension fund because I'm a trendy.
[03:01:45.370 --> 03:01:47.311]  Well, they're going to do what they're going to do.
[03:01:47.311 --> 03:01:50.673]  We've got to reach out to people that understand what's happening and reverse all this.
[03:01:50.673 --> 03:01:54.856]  So a lot of news coming out right now out of Bilderberg.
[03:01:54.856 --> 03:02:02.180]  We've also got the Times of London and others reporting the secret of Bilderberg Club ready for protest.
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:11.042]  So we've gone from world government not existing to the media admitting it's being set up and people aren't addressing the puppet presidents and prime ministers anymore.
[03:02:11.042 --> 03:02:13.482]  They're addressing the actual power structure.
[03:02:13.482 --> 03:02:23.605]  And that's why Brzezinski said two weeks ago, top global strategist, that the new world order is in trouble because for the first time in world history, the entire globe is awake to the true power structure.
[03:02:23.605 --> 03:02:25.165]  So we should all be celebrating.
[03:02:25.165 --> 03:02:29.786]  Once the real enemy is identified, they can now be defeated instead of us fighting windmills.
[03:02:30.106 --> 03:02:34.548]  Paul Watson joining us from England to break down the latest developments.
[03:02:34.548 --> 03:02:36.489]  Hello Alex, good to be back.
[03:02:36.489 --> 03:02:46.374]  And there we have it ladies and gentlemen, Paul Watson via video Skype, looking like the Grinch that stole Christmas.
[03:02:46.374 --> 03:02:49.415]  Hey Watson, good to have you here with us.
[03:02:49.415 --> 03:02:50.396]  A lot going on.
[03:02:50.396 --> 03:02:54.778]  So many years interviewing him and to have him from England on video, it's just weird.
[03:02:54.778 --> 03:02:58.480]  Watson, we're about to go on a break, but tell us what's coming up after the break.
[03:03:00.063 --> 03:03:08.206]  Well yeah, the fact that Bilderberg is now an open conspiracy is exemplified today with this London Times article.
[03:03:08.206 --> 03:03:17.229]  Ten years ago, the London Times, which is the premier establishment newspaper next to the New York Times and Washington Post, they wouldn't even
[03:03:18.229 --> 03:03:28.040]  mention the fact that Bilderberg existed and now today they're reporting not only who's attending but what their agenda will be.
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:36.290]  So, again, that underscores the fact that everything that Bilderberg are talking about is now public and is now in our faces.
[03:03:40.924 --> 03:03:46.892]  Also, you've got a report out at PrisonPlanet.com about Iran announcing 40-plus billion dollars of U.S.
[03:03:46.892 --> 03:03:49.376]  currency they're going to dump in favor of gold.
[03:03:49.376 --> 03:03:50.658]  That should cause some fireworks.
[03:03:52.193 --> 03:04:03.938]  Well that's right because Bilderberg are basically in a blind panic about the euro collapsing because for them it represents the embryonic global currency.
[03:04:03.938 --> 03:04:19.806]  We know that the ultimate agenda is to move towards a one world currency and that's exactly what IMF chief and Bilderberg member Dominique Strasse-Kahn recently said at a meeting of elitists in Zurich.
[03:04:19.806 --> 03:04:19.986]  So
[03:04:20.686 --> 03:04:41.130]  They're in a blind panic about the situation with the Euro, and now that Iran and other central banks in the Gulf are quickly heading for the exit door, it's a big panic situation amongst the Bilderberg members.
[03:04:41.130 --> 03:04:45.591]  Paul Watson joining us via video Skype from England, straight ahead.
[03:04:45.591 --> 03:04:48.052]  By the way, the audio is awesome, it's like he's in studio.
[03:04:48.971 --> 03:04:49.652]  I love it!
[03:04:49.652 --> 03:04:52.433]  Simulcasting and all at PrisonPlanet.TV.

[03:05:08.264 --> 03:05:13.407]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:05:13.407 --> 03:05:15.469]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[03:05:17.472 --> 03:05:37.874]  Well they make blue diamond gusset chains They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[03:05:58.795 --> 03:05:59.295]  Others don't.
[03:06:05.262 --> 03:06:06.523]  Tyranny is here.
[03:06:06.523 --> 03:06:10.184]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:06:10.184 --> 03:06:12.685]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:06:12.685 --> 03:06:18.548]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:06:18.548 --> 03:06:24.811]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:06:25.231 --> 03:06:31.196]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:06:31.196 --> 03:06:35.380]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:06:35.380 --> 03:06:39.664]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[03:06:45.629 --> 03:06:49.172]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:06:49.172 --> 03:06:51.153]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:06:51.153 --> 03:06:51.594]  It's here.

[03:07:01.542 --> 03:07:04.564]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:04.564 --> 03:07:09.889]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:09.889 --> 03:07:11.950]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:11.950 --> 03:07:16.934]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:16.934 --> 03:07:18.135]  How much do you want?
[03:07:18.135 --> 03:07:18.876]  When do you want it?
[03:07:19.236 --> 03:07:21.118]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:07:21.118 --> 03:07:22.199]  When will you need it?
[03:07:22.199 --> 03:07:24.402]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:24.402 --> 03:07:25.743]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:25.743 --> 03:07:27.265]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:27.265 --> 03:07:32.530]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:07:32.530 --> 03:07:36.134]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:36.134 --> 03:07:39.598]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:39.938 --> 03:07:41.159]  How much will you need?
[03:07:41.159 --> 03:07:42.060]  We don't know.
[03:07:42.060 --> 03:07:43.161]  How much do you want?
[03:07:43.161 --> 03:07:44.102]  All you can get.
[03:07:44.102 --> 03:07:45.183]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:45.183 --> 03:07:48.246]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:07:48.246 --> 03:07:50.449]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:07:50.449 --> 03:07:51.450]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:08:06.468 --> 03:08:11.312]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:11.312 --> 03:08:12.894]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.894 --> 03:08:13.855]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.855 --> 03:08:18.639]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.639 --> 03:08:22.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.257 --> 03:08:33.422]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson, the editor of PrisonPlanet.com, joins us for the next 20 minutes or so.
[03:08:33.422 --> 03:08:40.527]  Then we have London Guardian reporter Charlie Skelton joining us from Spain, the site of Bilderberg 2010.
[03:08:40.527 --> 03:08:47.852]  Watson, you've written a lot of articles about what's happening globally around the planet, what's happening with the economy, with currencies, and of course the Bilderberg Group.
[03:08:47.852 --> 03:08:52.175]  If we have new listeners tuning in, we're saying, why do we care about the Bilderberg Group?
[03:08:52.175 --> 03:08:53.216]  Well, as Jim Tucker
[03:08:54.289 --> 03:08:54.549]  I don't
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:20.041]  You know, give me your number and I'll call you after the fact.
[03:09:20.041 --> 03:09:23.742]  And then they call you going, my God, they're planning to enslave us.
[03:09:23.742 --> 03:09:25.162]  I want to tell you.
[03:09:25.162 --> 03:09:26.783]  And you find out everything.
[03:09:26.783 --> 03:09:28.963]  And we've been on record with all of this.
[03:09:28.963 --> 03:09:33.365]  And of course, it's just one of the big meeting groups of the overall world government.
[03:09:33.365 --> 03:09:37.186]  But Watson, let's break down what's happening with the world government right now.
[03:09:37.186 --> 03:09:44.308]  Because the good news from every source, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of their top minions, is that they are getting in deep trouble.
[03:09:44.308 --> 03:09:46.969]  And, you know, they're kind of like the cartoon cat
[03:09:47.489 --> 03:09:55.815]  In a old cartoon with a hundred dishes and plates trying to balance things and it's only a matter of time till they stumble.
[03:09:55.815 --> 03:10:00.078]  Of course, in that process it's going to be very, very messy, should we say.
[03:10:00.078 --> 03:10:02.720]  So joining us via video Skype, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:03.201]  Break it down.
[03:10:04.602 --> 03:10:09.824]  Well yeah, just to pick up on what you just mentioned with the secrecy aspect.
[03:10:09.824 --> 03:10:17.368]  They're having problems with leaks coming out of Bilderberg, and obviously this has intensified over the last few years.
[03:10:17.368 --> 03:10:20.969]  And now we learn out of the London Times report today that
[03:10:22.370 --> 03:10:30.397]  Most Bilderberg members, certainly the most prominent ones that are going to be there today, are bringing their own staff.
[03:10:30.397 --> 03:10:39.364]  So whereas they'd normally rely on hotel staff to do all the cooking and cleaning and washing and providing all the services for them,
[03:10:39.884 --> 03:10:50.720]  Now they're bringing their own in-house staff and that's explicitly to prevent leaks of information getting out to Bilderberg sleuths that are there on the scene.
[03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:54.526]  So they're very concerned about secrecy and things coming out.
[03:10:55.447 --> 03:11:20.419]  But as we've, you know, the theme is that it is now an open conspiracy because Bildberg members who get together once a year are revealing their agenda to their own flock beforehand and this comes out in CFR speeches and in speeches such as the one I mentioned before the break, Dominique Strasse-Kahn who gave a speech in Zurich.
[03:11:20.419 --> 03:11:24.361]  So all this is coming out before they even meet which is why
[03:11:25.663 --> 03:11:44.371]  The topics of their conversations are already known to us beforehand and certainly top of the agenda this year is the collapse of the euro because for Bilderberg the euro represents their embryonic one world currency.
[03:11:44.371 --> 03:11:54.416]  Now they already broke the terms of their own Maastricht Treaty to bail out Greece which they said they would never do but they did it because
[03:11:55.436 --> 03:12:02.044]  They're in a blind panic about the fact that the euro is basically on its way out.
[03:12:02.044 --> 03:12:16.259]  You've got Iran, you've got other central banks fleeing from the currency and if the euro were to go under then it would expose the inherent weakness of continental monetary unions and that would
[03:12:17.060 --> 03:12:21.121]  All but derail their wider agenda for a One World Currency.
[03:12:21.121 --> 03:12:25.062]  And of course I had Greg Pallast on, who I'm going to get back on by the way next week, guys.
[03:12:25.062 --> 03:12:41.667]  I had him on a few weeks ago and he talked about meeting with some of the, a BBC reporter, high level, with some of the founders of Euro and they bragged, the Euro was set up to take control of nations and rob them as an IMF World Bank extraction arm, just like they do Africa, Asia, Latin America.
[03:12:42.527 --> 03:12:43.128]  I don't know.
[03:13:06.184 --> 03:13:09.186]  Uh, debt black hole was removed.
[03:13:09.186 --> 03:13:10.227]  This is not free market.
[03:13:10.227 --> 03:13:12.348]  This is parasite market.
[03:13:12.348 --> 03:13:21.894]  So the battle is joined with Deutschland, Germany, which are big New World Order people, saying politically, no, we're not going along with fresh rounds of looting.
[03:13:21.894 --> 03:13:25.556]  So all is not well in the kingdom of the New World Order.
[03:13:26.940 --> 03:13:27.600]  Well, that's right.
[03:13:27.600 --> 03:13:51.036]  I mean, that's exactly what Brzezinski said during his CFR speech a couple of weeks ago, that not only was there a global awakening taking place amongst the people, but there was massive infighting within the elite itself, and Germany is very upset about what the EU, what certain blocks of the EU were forced to do with Greece.
[03:13:51.036 --> 03:13:56.640]  So now, at the Bilderberg Conference in Barcelona, just outside Barcelona,
[03:13:58.041 --> 03:14:09.070]  The key men who will be attending are from Spain, obviously, but not only because it's in Spain, but because Spain could become the next Greece.
[03:14:09.070 --> 03:14:15.855]  And if Spain goes the same way as Greece, then the Euro is basically heading for the toilet.
[03:14:15.855 --> 03:14:18.978]  Yeah, they've already lost their AAA rating last week.
[03:14:20.438 --> 03:14:38.271]  Yeah, they lost the AAA rating, so now the Spanish Prime Minister, Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is going to give the keynote opening address at Bilderberg, and he's going to be accompanied by the Spanish Foreign Minister, as well as Spain's former Economy Minister.
[03:14:40.032 --> 03:14:57.676]  They're basically there to try and reassure the Bilderberg members that Spain won't go the same way as Greece with massive crippling debts which of course lead to these austerity measures which provoke the riots that we've seen across Greece in the last couple of months.
[03:14:57.676 --> 03:15:01.077]  So you've got a heavy presence from Spain and
[03:15:02.642 --> 03:15:05.546]  That's because Spain is in trouble.
[03:15:05.546 --> 03:15:16.400]  Part of their problem is not just related to the economic meltdown, it's because of Spain's disastrous effort to implement the green economy.
[03:15:17.762 --> 03:15:36.405]  Which they were mandated to do by Bilderberg policies, specifically the EU Commission head Barroso, who coined the term post-industrial revolution, and the green economy is part of that post-industrial revolution.
[03:15:36.425 --> 03:15:42.007]  And it's designed to destroy your economy so you can't pay the bankers back, so they come in and take over.
[03:15:42.007 --> 03:15:44.368]  I mean, it's literally economic warfare.
[03:15:44.368 --> 03:16:05.118]  In the words of the Club of Rome, of the UN, of the head of NASA, of the White House Science Czar, I mean, this is a group of control freaks engaging in economic siege, and they are carrying this operation out, and we must have Europe throw their behinds out of there.
[03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:16.475]  Yeah, and it's an agenda to reduce living standards which is what is happening in Europe as the taxes go up and the public services get cut.
[03:16:16.475 --> 03:16:20.018]  And it's being felt most painfully in Spain.
[03:16:20.018 --> 03:16:33.726]  You've got an unemployment rate in Spain of 18% and that is a consequence of this green economy because for every job created as part of the green economy, more than 2.2 jobs are lost.
[03:16:35.507 --> 03:16:48.252]  And in fact, a leaked internal document that came out of Spain a couple of weeks ago said that the rate of job loss is in fact worse than 2.2 jobs for everyone gained.
[03:16:48.252 --> 03:16:57.215]  So, the report basically said if we don't get out of this post-industrial revolution, this green economy, we're going to face economic ruin.
[03:16:57.995 --> 03:17:16.893]  So that's what the Spanish political leaders are at Bilderberg to discuss, is how they can extricate themselves from this green economy, rescue their own economy, and in turn rescue the euro, which is what Bilderberg and the globalists in general need to do.
[03:17:17.554 --> 03:17:22.802]  If confidence will remain in their agenda to create a global currency.
[03:17:22.802 --> 03:17:29.733]  Because if the Euro goes, then a big part of their agenda to centralise the world economic system goes.
[03:17:31.580 --> 03:17:39.049]  Separately, your report that's also in Press TV, the official organ of Tehran, that fits into this.
[03:17:39.049 --> 03:17:47.038]  More and more of the Arab nations and the Persians and the Iranians are saying they're dumping the dollar right now and going to gold.
[03:17:47.038 --> 03:17:50.562]  And of course you notice gold's been up the last few days.
[03:17:50.562 --> 03:17:51.442]  Break that down for us.
[03:17:53.339 --> 03:18:11.695]  Yeah the central bank of Iran announced today that they were going to dump 45 billion euros and exchange it for gold bullion and dollars and also Chinese state media reported that several Gulf states were going to do the same thing.
[03:18:11.695 --> 03:18:13.937]  Now the major central banks are
[03:18:14.577 --> 03:18:15.177]  Desperately
[03:18:31.702 --> 03:18:32.223]  I don't
[03:18:51.457 --> 03:18:56.821]  That intervention would buoy the currency and it would last for days or weeks.
[03:18:56.821 --> 03:19:05.527]  But as we've seen today, with the euro flat or even down against the dollar, the last time I looked about an hour ago, it doesn't work anymore.
[03:19:05.527 --> 03:19:18.175]  Even though the central banks are intervening, investors and other countries like Iran and Gulf states are still aggressively dumping the euro because they've read the predictions of
[03:19:19.116 --> 03:19:27.080]  Big financial houses like BNP Paribas who say that the euro is going to parity against the dollar by next year.
[03:19:27.080 --> 03:19:30.201]  And of course the dollar is going to soon follow in its footsteps.
[03:19:30.201 --> 03:19:34.664]  When we come back, absolutely, when we come back we're going to get your take from the Times of London.
[03:19:34.664 --> 03:19:37.185]  Greece urged to give up euro.
[03:19:37.185 --> 03:19:40.987]  The Greek government has been advised by British economists to leave the euro in default.
[03:19:41.707 --> 03:19:55.791]  On its 300 billion pound debt to save its economy, the Center for Economics and Business Research, a London-based consultancy, has warned Greek ministers they will be unable to escape their debt trap without devaluing their currency to boost exports.
[03:19:55.791 --> 03:19:57.351]  And that's actually true!
[03:19:57.351 --> 03:20:01.232]  We'll be right back and get Watson's take on this and the flotilla incident.
[03:20:01.232 --> 03:20:01.612]  Stay with us.

[03:22:02.093 --> 03:22:07.057]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:22:07.057 --> 03:22:08.058]  What have we got?
[03:22:08.058 --> 03:22:10.500]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:22:10.500 --> 03:22:11.521]  A republic.
[03:22:11.521 --> 03:22:14.163]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:22:14.163 --> 03:22:16.425]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:22:16.425 --> 03:22:18.467]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:22:18.467 --> 03:22:20.148]  So they think they own our land?
[03:22:20.148 --> 03:22:21.470]  They think they own our water?
[03:22:21.470 --> 03:22:22.050]  Children?
[03:22:22.050 --> 03:22:23.191]  Our education?
[03:22:23.191 --> 03:22:24.032]  Our money?
[03:22:24.032 --> 03:22:27.655]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:22:28.035 --> 03:22:31.739]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:22:31.739 --> 03:22:33.001]  You have been warned.
[03:22:33.001 --> 03:22:34.022]  We have the facts.
[03:22:34.022 --> 03:22:35.183]  We have the Constitution.
[03:22:35.183 --> 03:22:36.085]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:22:36.085 --> 03:22:36.986]  We have common law.
[03:22:36.986 --> 03:22:39.509]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:22:48.337 --> 03:22:49.839]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:22:49.839 --> 03:22:50.920]  Don't tread on me.

[03:23:02.759 --> 03:23:05.781]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:05.781 --> 03:23:11.103]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:11.103 --> 03:23:13.144]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:13.144 --> 03:23:17.907]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:18.147 --> 03:23:19.327]  How much do you want?
[03:23:19.327 --> 03:23:20.448]  When do you want it?
[03:23:20.448 --> 03:23:22.329]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:23:22.329 --> 03:23:23.409]  When will you need it?
[03:23:23.409 --> 03:23:25.610]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:23:25.610 --> 03:23:26.950]  Will there be any food?
[03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:28.471]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:23:28.471 --> 03:23:33.752]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:23:33.752 --> 03:23:37.334]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:23:37.334 --> 03:23:40.795]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:23:41.155 --> 03:23:42.376]  How much will you need?
[03:23:42.376 --> 03:23:43.276]  We don't know.
[03:23:43.276 --> 03:23:44.377]  How much do you want?
[03:23:44.377 --> 03:23:45.298]  All you can get.
[03:23:45.298 --> 03:23:46.398]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:46.398 --> 03:23:49.460]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:23:49.460 --> 03:23:51.221]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:51.221 --> 03:23:52.142]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:24:12.506 --> 03:24:16.677]  By the way, this video Skype is working so well from England.
[03:24:16.677 --> 03:24:18.462]  Really, Watson has great political...
[03:24:20.023 --> 03:24:21.084]  Understanding and research.
[03:24:21.084 --> 03:24:24.726]  That's why he's one of our chief writers and webmasters.
[03:24:24.726 --> 03:24:29.968]  I remember eight, nine years ago when I hired him, watching some of the work he was doing and thinking it was first rate.
[03:24:29.968 --> 03:24:31.589]  He's been part of the team for a long time.
[03:24:31.589 --> 03:24:36.372]  So now that we have this, this is a great video slash audio connection to England.
[03:24:36.372 --> 03:24:43.616]  We may have to start having Watson sit in occasionally when I'm working on a film or out of town on assignment.
[03:24:44.456 --> 03:25:03.573]  Going back to Paul Watson and the four and a half minutes we've got left before we go to Spain and talk about the Bilderberg group to the nearby city of Sigis, where the airspace has now been closed for the owners, the criminal owners of the planet, to nest and plan their next rip-off.
[03:25:03.573 --> 03:25:04.333]  We went to break
[03:25:05.610 --> 03:25:15.522]  And we were talking about this headline, Greece urged to give up Euro, so this thing is really falling apart quickly, Watson.
[03:25:17.557 --> 03:25:33.962]  Yeah, and a lot of people in Greece said that that's exactly what they should do, but the leadership in Greece have been strong-armed by the globalists to not exit the Euro because it would only worsen the crisis of confidence in the Euro.
[03:25:35.743 --> 03:25:39.067]  This is what Bilderberg 2010 is going to be all about.
[03:25:39.067 --> 03:25:41.009]  How do we save the euro?
[03:25:41.009 --> 03:25:56.605]  Because everybody's predicting that it's going to go to parity with the dollar, and every time the central banks try and intervene and push the euro back up again when it gets to that 1.21 level, it just sinks straight back down again the next day.
[03:25:56.605 --> 03:25:57.886]  So, I mean, this is
[03:25:59.107 --> 03:26:02.710]  The euro represents their entire agenda for a world currency.
[03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:14.600]  So if confidence is lost in the euro, then it proves that their claims that stability comes with unity are completely false.
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:23.608]  So it won't allow them to exploit the economic crisis which they created further to get their world government, which is what they've called for.
[03:26:23.608 --> 03:26:26.070]  I want to go back to this article briefly.
[03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:27.191]  You know, these little devils
[03:26:29.024 --> 03:26:29.884]  Aren't gods.
[03:26:29.884 --> 03:26:35.065]  I mean, they're not in total control, but I think they're basically playing both sides.
[03:26:35.065 --> 03:26:46.327]  Because I remember Trilateral Commission documents from over 20 years ago where they were talking about building up a few competing global currencies and then letting them collapse to bring in the SDR.
[03:26:46.327 --> 03:26:55.609]  So these little devils could have a method to their madness where they're claiming they don't want the euro to go belly up, but that's actually a way to save the dollar and then roll it into an SDR.
[03:26:58.680 --> 03:27:12.393]  Well yeah, if the crisis in confidence in fiat money became so bad then, they would then try to exploit that crisis for a global currency based on SDRs.
[03:27:12.393 --> 03:27:21.341]  But I don't see them doing that because from every indication they need to save the euro because it represents their entire agenda.
[03:27:21.341 --> 03:27:22.262]  But you're right, I mean,
[03:27:22.742 --> 03:27:43.691]  They created the economic crisis from the bubbles that they manufactured but it seems to be out of control and it seems that many, even inside the globalist circles, are concerned that the plunge happened too soon and too fast and now it threatens to wipe out some of the wealth of even those who were somewhat prepared for it.
[03:27:46.340 --> 03:27:58.505]  Bilderberg are talking about prolonging a financial recession for another year, but whether things are too far out of hand for them to adequately manage that situation remains to be seen.
[03:27:58.505 --> 03:28:09.529]  So that will be what comes out of Bilderberg this year, so we'll be watching for the different discussions that come out of the conference on that subject.
[03:28:10.103 --> 03:28:16.189]  Well I was reading US, well at the time, colony newspaper articles.
[03:28:16.189 --> 03:28:22.196]  I have some books that are compendiums of newspaper articles and also captains accounts.
[03:28:22.196 --> 03:28:25.079]  I was reading some naval accounts of Newfoundland
[03:28:25.299 --> 03:28:25.359]  Yes.
[03:28:48.471 --> 03:28:56.058]  This particular pirate captain was coming and they still just surrendered to them.
[03:28:56.058 --> 03:28:58.320]  And it's the same thing that we're doing today.
[03:28:58.320 --> 03:29:09.030]  We have this group of piratical New World Order people and if we just get the will to say no to them and the will to see through their flimflam of telling us there's no world government, the banks aren't robbing us.
[03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:12.072]  I mean, if we just stand up and wake up, we can brush them aside.
[03:29:12.933 --> 03:29:20.175]  If we just decide to beat them, I mean, can 2,000 people in a town with hundreds of ships beat 60 people?
[03:29:20.175 --> 03:29:21.775]  Well, of course we can!
[03:29:21.775 --> 03:29:27.797]  I mean, it's just complete cowardice, Watson, and it's the same parallel today.
[03:29:27.797 --> 03:29:35.359]  That's right, but we're slowly starting to turn the tide and, you know, getting anti-establishment candidates into office, and that's what they're afraid of.
[03:29:36.787 --> 03:29:37.428]  Absolutely.
[03:29:37.428 --> 03:29:38.249]  All right, Watson.
[03:29:38.249 --> 03:29:41.212]  We'll talk to you again next week via video Skype.
[03:29:41.212 --> 03:29:44.415]  Joining us here on air, he'll be popping in at least once next week.
[03:29:44.415 --> 03:29:47.518]  We'll go to Bilderberg in Spain next, straight ahead.
[03:29:47.518 --> 03:29:51.162]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the key websites.
[03:29:51.162 --> 03:29:51.943]  That's Infowars.com.
[03:29:51.943 --> 03:29:55.787]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.787 --> 03:29:58.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.383 --> 03:30:05.486]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[03:30:46.327 --> 03:30:47.007]  Look for Max
[03:30:47.287 --> 03:30:51.710]  The Orange Home Gain Gorilla to help you with any real estate needs you might have.
[03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:52.950]  You'll love this site.
[03:30:52.950 --> 03:30:54.732]  It's HomeGain.com.
[03:30:54.732 --> 03:30:57.713]  H-O-M-E G-A-I-N.com.
[03:30:57.713 --> 03:30:58.454]  Check them out today.
[03:31:00.962 --> 03:31:03.304]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:03.304 --> 03:31:05.685]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:05.685 --> 03:31:08.887]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:08.887 --> 03:31:13.990]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:13.990 --> 03:31:18.193]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:18.493 --> 03:31:20.955]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:20.955 --> 03:31:23.736]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:23.736 --> 03:31:26.638]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:26.638 --> 03:31:34.243]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:34.574 --> 03:31:39.976]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:39.976 --> 03:31:42.297]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:42.297 --> 03:31:46.519]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:46.519 --> 03:31:47.579]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:47.579 --> 03:31:48.920]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:48.920 --> 03:31:50.420]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:01.516 --> 03:32:04.518]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[03:32:04.518 --> 03:32:06.599]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[03:32:06.599 --> 03:32:09.341]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[03:32:09.341 --> 03:32:11.562]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[03:32:11.562 --> 03:32:12.983]  Okay, here it comes.
[03:32:12.983 --> 03:32:14.885]  But first, the facts.
[03:32:14.885 --> 03:32:16.806]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[03:32:16.806 --> 03:32:18.807]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[03:32:18.807 --> 03:32:22.490]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[03:32:22.490 --> 03:32:30.234]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[03:32:30.234 --> 03:32:30.855]  Sinofresh.
[03:32:31.095 --> 03:32:34.176]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[03:32:50.482 --> 03:32:50.842]  Mention GCN.

[03:32:51.783 --> 03:32:52.143]  It works!
[03:33:14.346 --> 03:33:17.490]  I was a prisoner of doubt!
[03:33:17.490 --> 03:33:18.251]  Uh, not anymore.
[03:33:18.251 --> 03:33:27.363]  Okay, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio transmission, uh, possible.
[03:33:29.557 --> 03:33:31.757]  This anglophile transmission.
[03:33:31.757 --> 03:33:36.238]  A lot of Brits are British expatriates on the show today.
[03:33:36.238 --> 03:33:45.320]  We're going to be talking to London Guardian reporter and more, Charlie Skelton, here in just a moment.
[03:33:45.320 --> 03:33:50.581]  In fact, I'm looking for my bio on Charlie Skelton because I just... Oh, here it is.
[03:33:50.581 --> 03:33:51.761]  I have it right here.
[03:33:51.761 --> 03:33:54.662]  He's at the Bilderberg Group meeting in Sigis,
[03:33:55.622 --> 03:33:56.763]  Spain right now.
[03:33:56.763 --> 03:33:59.845]  It gets started tomorrow, but they've shut down the hotel today.
[03:33:59.845 --> 03:34:04.449]  We're going to have Jim Tucker on and some other reporters tomorrow as well, and Charlie will be back with us on Friday.
[03:34:04.449 --> 03:34:06.190]  Hopefully he won't get arrested like last time.
[03:34:06.190 --> 03:34:12.654]  I mean, I hope he calls us when we're live if he does get arrested again before Friday, but we hope he doesn't get arrested, period.
[03:34:12.654 --> 03:34:16.197]  So we'll talk to this daring reporter here in just a moment.
[03:34:16.197 --> 03:34:19.499]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about a coloblue.com.
[03:34:19.499 --> 03:34:22.621]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[03:34:23.742 --> 03:34:25.825]  It's an atmospheric water generator.
[03:34:25.825 --> 03:34:29.489]  Kind of like Luke Skywalker's moisture evaporators.
[03:34:29.489 --> 03:34:33.153]  And they'll be held to pay if those units aren't fixed in the South Range.
[03:34:33.153 --> 03:34:36.958]  But to be serious, it grabs water directly out of the air.
[03:34:36.958 --> 03:34:38.860]  They have little units that do seven gallons a day.
[03:34:38.860 --> 03:34:41.143]  They have big units that do thousands of gallons a day.
[03:34:41.143 --> 03:34:41.924]  Very affordable.
[03:34:43.899 --> 03:34:47.321]  Looks like a high-tech water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[03:34:47.321 --> 03:34:50.684]  Okolablue.com, the cleanest, best drinking water you can get, period.
[03:34:50.684 --> 03:34:51.304]  Okolablue.com or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[03:34:51.304 --> 03:34:53.126]  And lastly, I want to tell you about my solar backup.
[03:35:00.891 --> 03:35:03.672]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[03:35:03.672 --> 03:35:10.615]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[03:35:10.615 --> 03:35:11.535]  Here's why.
[03:35:11.535 --> 03:35:14.796]  Plug-and-play solar generators are now available from Solutions from Science.
[03:35:14.796 --> 03:35:21.759]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current wherever and whenever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[03:35:22.159 --> 03:35:25.861]  Unlike gas generators and solar generators run quietly and emits no fumes.
[03:35:25.861 --> 03:35:33.546]  It's like having your own electrical power plant and it's perfect for your home or campsite or work bench out in your shed or garage.
[03:35:33.546 --> 03:35:41.251]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts or you just don't like paying the man money, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:35:41.251 --> 03:35:44.353]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365 to get a free information package.
[03:35:44.353 --> 03:35:44.413]  877-327-0365.
[03:35:44.413 --> 03:35:44.513]  Okay!
[03:35:51.896 --> 03:35:54.860]  Now going to Charlie Skelton who got arrested last year.
[03:35:54.860 --> 03:35:59.426]  We were able to actually have him on from the police station when he still had his cell phone.
[03:35:59.426 --> 03:36:04.794]  An Oxford University graduate, journalist for the Evening Standard, The Guardian.
[03:36:04.794 --> 03:36:06.035]  He also writes satire.
[03:36:07.216 --> 03:36:11.037]  And has written quite a few books, and we'll give you his website before he leaves us.
[03:36:11.037 --> 03:36:16.138]  He's on TV shows on Channel 4, Reality TV, and BBC One.
[03:36:16.138 --> 03:36:19.339]  And of course in 2009, he covered the secret of Bilderberg Group.
[03:36:19.339 --> 03:36:23.220]  He went to basically write satire about it as a joke, but found out it wasn't a joke.
[03:36:23.220 --> 03:36:25.080]  And he also writes for the London Guardian.
[03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:31.601]  He joins us now from Spain, outside the Bilderberg Group Resort that they shut down today.
[03:36:31.601 --> 03:36:33.782]  So first off, Charlie, good to have you back this year.
[03:36:34.182 --> 03:36:41.044]  Tell us about how you got there, you were in the resort, what you saw being thrown out, the type of security you're witnessing right now.
[03:36:41.044 --> 03:36:42.064]  Hello, Alex.
[03:36:42.064 --> 03:36:51.367]  Yeah, well, we spent a couple of nights in the hotel, a little bit cheekily, before lockdown, which took place at noon today.
[03:36:51.367 --> 03:37:03.611]  And, you know, basically, all the guests left over the last few days, because they had, obviously, they had the Bilderberg block booking, and they were replaced by the conference organizers, who
[03:37:04.594 --> 03:37:05.574]  We're good to go.
[03:37:27.220 --> 03:37:40.211]  Um, you know, there's a small little road that leads up to it, and it's just by the seaside, and, you know, it's a small little sleepy town, and... The supreme leaders up in their citadel above the rabble scum!
[03:37:40.211 --> 03:37:40.651]  Very much.
[03:37:40.651 --> 03:37:44.555]  That is exactly what is happening, and, you know, and the same...
[03:37:45.726 --> 03:37:53.988]  It's the same dynamic of a very few, I mean more this year, but a few people coming to bear witness to the event.
[03:37:53.988 --> 03:38:04.050]  Pathetic rabble down beneath the walls with our centurions keeping a close eye on the dangerous scallywags.
[03:38:04.050 --> 03:38:05.271]  There's quite a lot of that actually.
[03:38:05.271 --> 03:38:10.252]  We have a, well we overheard a few conversations and
[03:38:11.607 --> 03:38:16.289]  We have a source in the conference team as well.
[03:38:16.289 --> 03:38:17.170]  Well, that's big news!
[03:38:17.170 --> 03:38:19.671]  You have a source inside the conference team.
[03:38:19.671 --> 03:38:20.991]  You were in there and overheard.
[03:38:20.991 --> 03:38:27.954]  Just like when I was in, I can back this up, when I was in Canada, but really in Virginia, I was in there the day they shut it down.
[03:38:27.954 --> 03:38:30.355]  It kind of stayed until the end until they were trying to throw us out.
[03:38:30.355 --> 03:38:37.838]  And there were like security teams and I was, you know, catching all of it and every spare room and office area was packed full of security people.
[03:38:39.359 --> 03:38:41.320]  Well, I can't tell you anything.
[03:38:41.320 --> 03:38:48.744]  I'm not going to tell you anything about the source, but I will tell you some interesting things.
[03:38:48.744 --> 03:39:02.072]  One of them is that there's a no-fly zone for four days over the hotel, and that's being enforced by police helicopters, and that begins at 8 a.m.
[03:39:02.072 --> 03:39:05.474]  tomorrow, which is the first official day of the conference.
[03:39:05.474 --> 03:39:07.315]  So, you know, I mean,
[03:39:08.862 --> 03:39:21.370]  We spoke to a barman and we were talking about the cost of this whole thing and he just said, look, you do not want to know how much this is costing.
[03:39:21.370 --> 03:39:27.634]  And, you know, when you think of it, I can't quite get past it in my mind, the sheer cost of this operation, it is huge.
[03:39:27.634 --> 03:39:29.896]  And if anyone thinks that it's not a large event,
[03:39:30.556 --> 03:39:32.878]  I've never seen anything like it.
[03:39:32.878 --> 03:39:39.845]  And of course the taxpayers pay with our tax money to protect the criminal rulers.
[03:39:39.845 --> 03:39:47.912]  And to be honest, I don't think the Spanish taxpayers are in any position to be paying for this kind of circus right now.
[03:39:47.912 --> 03:39:54.298]  Well listen, we're going to know more as the days develop and as you talk to journalists and your source, but what can you tell me about what you overheard?
[03:39:54.298 --> 03:39:56.600]  What can you tell me about what the source told you?
[03:39:57.605 --> 03:40:02.167]  Well, I can confirm some delegates who are coming.
[03:40:02.167 --> 03:40:04.268]  Some of them, they tend to come every year.
[03:40:04.268 --> 03:40:09.890]  There's Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[03:40:09.890 --> 03:40:12.371]  He'll be there.
[03:40:12.371 --> 03:40:15.673]  General Jack Keane.
[03:40:15.673 --> 03:40:17.874]  I think he was in charge of your army at some point.
[03:40:18.504 --> 03:40:19.584]  For some years.
[03:40:19.584 --> 03:40:26.087]  And interesting, a new name, I think, which is Marcus Agius, who's chairman of Barclays.
[03:40:26.087 --> 03:40:32.450]  And he's also senior non-executive director on the new BBC executive board.
[03:40:32.450 --> 03:40:32.570]  So
[03:40:33.533 --> 03:40:40.277]  It's interesting, the BBC may not be here covering the event live on the ground, but they do have someone inside.
[03:40:40.277 --> 03:40:53.324]  But actually, I mustn't badmouth the BBC because they put me on the radio this morning, on BBC Radio 4 Today programme and had a nice chat.
[03:40:53.324 --> 03:40:59.808]  Now you called this a loss of innocence last year because, I mean, you weren't really expecting to be clapped in irons.
[03:41:00.505 --> 03:41:03.886]  I really wasn't.
[03:41:03.886 --> 03:41:07.407]  I didn't have any idea, to be honest, what was going to happen at all.
[03:41:07.407 --> 03:41:18.031]  To find yourself in a completely dystopian reality with an extraordinary overreaction of
[03:41:19.191 --> 03:41:23.774]  Yeah, let's recap for those that forgot what happened last year to a London Guardian reporter.
[03:41:23.774 --> 03:41:26.956]  You got video of it being followed, harassed, arrested.
[03:41:26.956 --> 03:41:29.578]  There'd be police all around you and you'd say, stop following me.
[03:41:29.578 --> 03:41:31.139]  And they'd say, no one's following you.
[03:41:31.139 --> 03:41:33.701]  And you go to the police station to complain.
[03:41:33.701 --> 03:41:38.644]  And then you see the guys that have been following you there and they say, you're not seeing any of that, sir.
[03:41:38.644 --> 03:41:39.605]  You're quite insane.
[03:41:39.605 --> 03:41:41.186]  And then they finally did arrest you.
[03:41:41.186 --> 03:41:48.951]  So recap that and let's go back to, you know, this first look at Bilderberg 2010 and the valuable intel you've already found.
[03:41:48.971 --> 03:41:50.852]  Well, 2009 was my loss of innocence.
[03:41:58.606 --> 03:42:03.628]  You know, in the Athens... I had to run away to Athens because I was being chased around and arrested so much in Budokmania.
[03:42:03.628 --> 03:42:05.649]  And I really wasn't trying to do anything at all.
[03:42:05.649 --> 03:42:08.670]  And you know, you described me early on as a daring reporter.
[03:42:08.670 --> 03:42:10.650]  You know, that couldn't be further from the truth.
[03:42:10.650 --> 03:42:14.632]  I spent all of 2009 trying not to get arrested.
[03:42:14.632 --> 03:42:20.754]  And, you know, my plan for 2010 is very much along the same lines, not to get arrested.
[03:42:20.754 --> 03:42:23.015]  But, you know, last year I sat in an office in
[03:42:24.035 --> 03:42:35.688]  In Athens, opposite, you know, he was probably, I think he was the head of the Athens State Police that look after the Parliament and after their government, so very high up.
[03:42:36.980 --> 03:42:40.902]  I've worked out, I've realised who's been following me, it's you, it's your team.
[03:42:40.902 --> 03:42:46.826]  I've seen the guy in the loo just now, weirdly, having been denied all the way along, and he just said, no, you didn't see a man.
[03:42:46.826 --> 03:42:47.626]  You didn't see a man.
[03:42:47.626 --> 03:42:52.429]  And I sat there and I thought, my God, that's a scene from a movie.
[03:42:52.429 --> 03:42:57.511]  You don't want to be sitting opposite someone telling you you haven't seen what you've just seen, because it makes you think...
[03:42:59.244 --> 03:43:05.286]  You know, you're going to start seeing ones and zeros and the matrix will melt away and you think, you know, whatever.
[03:43:05.286 --> 03:43:06.486]  It's very unsettling.
[03:43:06.486 --> 03:43:07.846]  But that's their psychological.
[03:43:07.846 --> 03:43:14.568]  I mean, they've got Von Rumpy, Brown, all of them announcing world government run by the bankers that have engineered the financial collapse.
[03:43:14.568 --> 03:43:17.749]  We have their documents from over a decade ago planning this.
[03:43:17.749 --> 03:43:22.190]  And then they'll announce world government and then say, but we're not setting up a world government.
[03:43:22.190 --> 03:43:25.411]  And you're quite insane if you believe in one.
[03:43:25.411 --> 03:43:27.332]  I'm afraid it doesn't exist.
[03:43:28.092 --> 03:43:28.532]  I know.
[03:43:28.532 --> 03:43:32.234]  Look, I mean, I'm sick of it.
[03:43:32.234 --> 03:43:47.199]  I'm sick of ringing up reputable news agencies, and I'm not going to name any names, and speaking to people who work on their foreign news desk, and you say, well, I'm here in Spain covering the Bilderberg conference, and they go, the what?
[03:43:48.217 --> 03:43:50.538]  I mean, I'm thinking, look, this is a big deal.
[03:43:50.538 --> 03:43:52.398]  It really is a big deal.
[03:43:52.398 --> 03:43:59.560]  If you had 150, you've all heard it before, top football players meeting in secret, there'd be 50 helicopters above and 1,000 press.
[03:43:59.560 --> 03:44:07.723]  If you had 150 top Hollywood stars meeting in secret, and they've been doing it since 54, you'd have 1,000 helicopters and 5,000 press.
[03:44:07.723 --> 03:44:15.365]  But with this, it's just, oh, you don't see those black sedans pulling in, you don't see the tribs with machine guns, you don't see police dogs.
[03:44:15.365 --> 03:44:17.366]  I mean,
[03:44:18.470 --> 03:44:19.210]  Go ahead.
[03:44:19.210 --> 03:44:21.991]  Well, I was going to say that, you know, and what... Do you know what?
[03:44:21.991 --> 03:44:34.975]  I don't have a problem with a bunch of financiers and business people getting together to meet up to determine how to fleece, you know, me and whoever, or to sell me whatever mobile phone or anything.
[03:44:34.975 --> 03:44:35.515]  I don't care.
[03:44:35.515 --> 03:44:38.136]  They can strategize to their heart's content.
[03:44:38.136 --> 03:44:46.879]  But, you know, we've got a new coalition in Britain and what David Cameron, who's an ex-Bilderberg, and Nick Clegg,
[03:44:47.665 --> 03:44:48.445]  Well, that's like Obama.
[03:44:48.445 --> 03:44:51.326]  He said he's going to be the most transparent, he's more secretive than Bush.
[03:44:51.326 --> 03:44:54.826]  It's always the opposite with these guys when they tell you something.
[03:45:22.983 --> 03:45:27.506]  Because they are setting policy in there, and it's against the law in the U.S., the Logan Act.
[03:45:27.506 --> 03:45:30.928]  Did you hear about Daniel Estilin testifying before the European Parliament?
[03:45:30.928 --> 03:45:32.169]  So what's your take on that?
[03:45:46.391 --> 03:45:48.352]  It's not a conspiracy.
[03:45:48.352 --> 03:45:49.372]  It's a meeting.
[03:45:49.372 --> 03:45:50.413]  It's a conference.
[03:45:50.413 --> 03:45:51.433]  It's a four-day conference.
[03:46:07.961 --> 03:46:21.750]  Disregard what you're saying and always make the debate about whether it exists or not instead of having a debate about should these private bankers be setting up a global police state to fully extract all our wealth from us.
[03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:22.910]  That's exactly it.
[03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:36.259]  I'm so, I am so sick of every time one mentions any kind of, you know, I don't know what to call it, geomachinations or any kind of global strategy or any, you talk about any kind of large
[03:46:37.214 --> 03:46:40.136]  And that's just a rationalization.
[03:46:40.136 --> 03:46:43.459]  Hitler and Goebbels both said good propaganda is simple and mindless and speaks to people's own laziness.
[03:46:43.459 --> 03:46:44.780]  Well, guess what, folks?
[03:46:44.780 --> 03:46:46.001]  The banks are imploding the economy.
[03:46:46.001 --> 03:46:49.303]  They are setting up a world government.
[03:47:02.413 --> 03:47:09.956]  You can read Charlie Skelton's great columns at the London Guardian while he's there reporting, and we'll put that up on screen on TV for folks.
[03:47:09.956 --> 03:47:11.377]  You can also go to his website.
[03:47:11.377 --> 03:47:19.341]  Tell us the best ways to read your reportage while you're there in Spain covering our owners.
[03:47:19.341 --> 03:47:21.702]  Well, go to the Guardian website.
[03:47:21.702 --> 03:47:27.644]  If you just go to guardian.co.uk, you will, I'm sure, find me somewhere.
[03:47:27.644 --> 03:47:28.545]  Put in the word Bilderberg.
[03:47:29.076 --> 03:47:32.319]  Yeah, Charlie Skelton, Bilderberg, it's all over the place.
[03:47:32.319 --> 03:47:37.423]  Now, expanding on this, because I segwayed into what happened to you last year, what type of security are you seeing?
[03:47:37.423 --> 03:47:42.127]  What's some of the other intel you picked up from inside the club Bilderberg?
[03:47:42.127 --> 03:47:46.351]  Well, in terms of just the security, it's the same thing.
[03:47:46.351 --> 03:47:48.913]  It's absolutely immense.
[03:47:48.913 --> 03:47:52.516]  There are just dozens and dozens of
[03:47:53.334 --> 03:47:57.715]  Police cars, there are dozens and dozens of riot police vans.
[03:47:57.715 --> 03:48:07.257]  I mean, they are kitting themselves up as if they're about to be attacked by, you know, 100,000 heavily armed troops.
[03:48:07.257 --> 03:48:21.020]  Whereas, in fact, there are, you know, there's maybe two dozen, you know, very nice, kind people sitting outside who are a little bit clued up, who are sitting outside this police cordon just saying, you know,
[03:48:21.818 --> 03:48:26.000]  I'm not quite sure that what is going on up the hill is exactly right.
[03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:34.524]  I'm not quite sure the people up there are strategizing in my interests, or in fact in the interests of the majority of human beings on the planet.
[03:48:34.524 --> 03:48:39.467]  And, you know, they're there and they're saying their little thing and they're holding their signs.
[03:48:39.467 --> 03:48:41.408]  And, you know, a few meters away are
[03:48:51.800 --> 03:48:52.120]  Seriously?
[03:48:52.120 --> 03:48:55.843]  I mean, who are they expecting to come running up that hill?
[03:48:55.843 --> 03:49:17.958]  Well, they know they're identified, and they know we're looking at them, and they can't be happy that ten years ago you'd see no news about Bilderberg, now you Google the term, there are hundreds of articles a day in prestigious publications admitting Queen of the Netherlands, Prince of Holland, representatives of the British Royalty, the Spanish Royalty, they're all there, and people are going, wow, there really is an elite!
[03:49:17.958 --> 03:49:20.740]  And how dumb we were to be told no children
[03:49:21.320 --> 03:49:21.480]  Yeah.
[03:49:21.480 --> 03:49:23.021]  They don't love us.
[03:49:23.021 --> 03:49:24.683]  You know, they don't love us.
[03:49:24.683 --> 03:49:26.104]  They barely hate us.
[03:49:26.104 --> 03:49:27.965]  I think they just treat us as ones and zeros.
[03:49:42.782 --> 03:49:44.243]  No, I think that's closed up.
[03:49:44.243 --> 03:49:45.804]  It was purely why we were there in contact.
[03:49:45.804 --> 03:49:48.265]  You know, I mean, it's good to understand that the people running the conference
[03:49:57.274 --> 03:49:58.516]  They're all kinds of different people.
[03:49:58.516 --> 03:50:02.140]  You know, there are people who are just simply there to put up the lighting rigs.
[03:50:02.140 --> 03:50:06.004]  There are people there simply, you know, moving in crates of watermelons.
[03:50:06.004 --> 03:50:07.426]  You know, there's lots of people.
[03:50:07.426 --> 03:50:08.747]  It requires a lot of manpower.
[03:50:08.747 --> 03:50:12.431]  I mean, there's the maids, there's the security people, there's the police.
[03:50:12.431 --> 03:50:16.956]  But larger than that, and I'm not telling you what to do, but I always tell Tucker this, I tell all of them this.
[03:50:18.498 --> 03:50:23.143]  Because it seems 101 to me, but then I'm always in a hurry to get back to it and I don't do it.
[03:50:23.143 --> 03:50:33.253]  I need to go to Bilderberg three or four days before, be there during it, covering it when I'm kicked out, and then the real intel is after they leave, going back in and taking your time.
[03:50:34.354 --> 03:50:58.033]  Interviewing all the insiders and beforehand getting them to dig stuff out of the trash for you like Jim Tucker does but Final segment give us a bird's-eye view kind of a preview of the info You're gonna be giving us on Friday when you join us Charlie Skelton London Guardian reporter reporting from Bilderberg in Spain 2010 and we got Tucker and others joining us tomorrow.
[03:50:58.033 --> 03:51:00.035]  This is gonna be extremely informative stay with us
[03:51:02.489 --> 03:51:04.371]  Don't answer it!
[03:51:04.371 --> 03:51:12.481]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[03:51:12.481 --> 03:51:13.963]  800-477-9256.
[03:51:13.963 --> 03:51:20.070]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.

[03:55:33.793 --> 03:55:35.835]  I mean, I really hope that's not the case, but yeah, of course.
[03:55:53.812 --> 03:56:02.238]  Well, I mean, I got arrested just flying into Canada and they screamed and yelled at me and said, you're here for the conference, you bleeping piece of filth, you American garbage!
[03:56:02.238 --> 03:56:05.080]  So, I mean, they do this to basically everybody.
[03:56:05.080 --> 03:56:13.406]  But in the last three, four minutes we've got left, other key tidbits of data that you got while you were inside the resort before they threw you out?
[03:56:13.406 --> 03:56:19.290]  Well, you know, I've got a few things, but I just want to say that, you know, my role here is not
[03:56:20.658 --> 03:56:34.047]  I don't really see myself as trying to, you know, get that intel and to, um, you know, I do have some stuff which I'll, you know, I'm holding a little bit back, to be quite honest with you, to write about in The Guardian.
[03:56:34.047 --> 03:56:35.367]  That's terrible, isn't it?
[03:56:35.367 --> 03:56:36.408]  No, it's not.
[03:56:36.408 --> 03:56:39.210]  We'll get full details in The Guardian, but tell us more.
[03:56:39.210 --> 03:56:40.871]  I mean, tell us some of what you've picked up.
[03:56:42.873 --> 03:57:05.534]  I'd like to just talk about what I've picked up from putting together, I've been trying to sort of put together a little bit of a kind of, I guess you'd call it a press campaign for Bilderberg 2010 and you know I put together a website called Trilever.com, T-R-I-L-E-V-E-R.com and you know we've done and putting up press releases there as it were almost on behalf of Bilderberg.
[03:57:06.657 --> 03:57:12.555]  I've been ringing up the good news agencies and I rang up the... you'll enjoy this one... I rang up BBC
[03:57:14.443 --> 03:57:16.925]  Foreign News Desk for the TV.
[03:57:16.925 --> 03:57:21.888]  And you know, I preface this by saying I've had a lot of good experience with the BBC over the last few days.
[03:57:21.888 --> 03:57:26.471]  And I'm due to do an interview.
[03:57:26.471 --> 03:57:29.533]  So you're trying to get the mainstream media to report on this?
[03:57:29.533 --> 03:57:30.054]  Exactly.
[03:57:30.054 --> 03:57:30.894]  That's my role here.
[03:57:30.894 --> 03:57:32.975]  I really do see that as what I'm trying to do.
[03:57:32.975 --> 03:57:38.299]  And I rang up the BBC Foreign News Desk at their TV news section.
[03:57:40.818 --> 03:57:45.241]  You know, I'm negotiating with him about the story, about what they might do with it.
[03:57:45.241 --> 03:57:47.922]  And, you know, I'm feeding them ideas for stories.
[03:57:47.922 --> 03:57:53.806]  I ring back the next day and the guy goes, oh yeah, Bilderberg's been taken off our diary.
[03:57:53.806 --> 03:57:55.127]  And I said, sorry, what?
[03:57:55.127 --> 03:57:57.368]  He said, yeah, look, it wasn't my decision.
[03:57:57.368 --> 03:57:58.849]  He sounded quite shifty.
[03:57:58.849 --> 03:57:59.910]  Can you tell us his name?
[03:57:59.910 --> 03:58:04.372]  Because that's big news that BBC was hot on this and then the story got killed.
[03:58:04.372 --> 03:58:05.113]  Do you know what?
[03:58:05.113 --> 03:58:06.434]  I can't remember his name.
[03:58:06.434 --> 03:58:07.714]  I've written it down, though, somewhere.
[03:58:07.714 --> 03:58:09.996]  Was this with BBC TV or BBC Radio?
[03:58:10.276 --> 03:58:24.533]  I think it was BBC TV News, and it was... And then, but yeah, they said it's been taken off the diary, and he said it wasn't my decision, and... We're almost out of time, we'll talk to you again Friday, but any other key info that we're going to be looking for in the Guardian in more detail?
[03:58:24.533 --> 03:58:27.056]  Sorry, I mean, I'm just going to be rambling on as usual, and...
[03:58:29.508 --> 03:58:31.792]  Alright, well, Mr. Skelton, we're out of time.
[03:58:31.792 --> 03:58:33.455]  We're glad you're there.
[03:58:33.455 --> 03:58:37.022]  We'll check in with you again tomorrow if anything breaks, but for sure on Friday.
