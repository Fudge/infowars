[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.430]  So, Congressman Ron Paul, I don't know how he does it.
[00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:18.256]  Legislation, lobbying on the floor, doing 10-15 media events a day, writing books, running Campaign for Liberty, supporting Rand Paul with the incredible realignment we're seeing politically.
[00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:21.457]  But he does it, and God bless him, he's Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:22.518]  I want to talk about Iran.
[00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:23.978]  I don't
[00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:51.640]  Whether it's a Republican for the first time in 20 years winning in Hawaii for the Congress, to your son Rand Paul with a 30-point defeat of the establishment Republican.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.281]  Have you ever seen a realignment like this?
[00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:59.383]  Because generally it's one political party or the other that is seeing massive losses.
[00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:05.746]  But what I'm seeing is across the board incumbents and establishment candidates are being annihilated.
[00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:07.866]  No, I think that's absolutely right.
[00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:09.226]  This is different.
[00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:16.389]  I think there's been periods of time when people get very frustrated, like you indicate, they might shift back and forth from one party to the other.
[00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.631]  But right now, they're unhappy with both parties.
[00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:31.216]  But the real tragedy is that we don't have a good, and I say this word cautiously, a democratic process, the democratic election, the ability of parties to compete.
[00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:43.022]  There's a monopoly control by the Republicans and the Democrats, and since philosophically they're not too far apart, they sort of gang up on anybody who wants to offer an alternative.
[00:01:43.443 --> 00:01:52.988]  So if we had had a very strong third party, so here all the people talk about the Tea Party as if it's a party, but it really isn't a party, it's an alternative.
[00:01:53.688 --> 00:02:17.557]  And that's why the mixture comes up, because sometimes Democrats are in trouble, sometimes Republicans are in trouble, but there's no one party to fulfill the role that is necessary, and I don't think that's going to happen soon, because the laws make it very difficult to get on ballots, and the media doesn't allow people to get into the debates and this sort of thing, so they're very, very handicapped.
[00:02:19.717 --> 00:02:32.382]  I just think that we're going to see this messy situation, but I think it's just great that people are unhappy, they're very active, they want changes, and they're picking and choosing, and they're sending a loud message.
[00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:36.233]  Both parties are getting a little bit upset.
[00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:42.517]  I mean, Republicans, you know, in one sense, they say, well, these Tea Party people, they're a little bit nuts.
[00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:43.438]  We can't deal with them.
[00:02:43.478 --> 00:02:48.841]  But then when they find out the Tea Party is a political force, they say, oh, I guess we better deal with them.
[00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:50.502]  So they're in a dilemma, too.
[00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:59.568]  But I think it'll work out as long as the people who are unhappy stick to their guns and try to agree on some basic principles.
[00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:02.470]  We either have too much government or too little government.
[00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.252]  We either spend too much money or too little to spend the money.
[00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:07.814]  We either have a lousy foreign policy or we don't have it.
[00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:17.641]  So I think those are the kind of things that we have to stick to our guns and be as consistent as possible and see what we can do to contribute to a positive change in this country.
[00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:32.173]  There's no doubt, Congressman, I want to get your breakdown on this, that the establishment is scared, though, and they're going to pull out all the stomps to try to demonize any type of true grassroots constitutionalist candidate.
[00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:36.174]  I mean, we're seeing them say, if you're against the health care bill, you must be a racist.
[00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:40.675]  But I think they've overplayed their hand by running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:48.321]  Yeah, and that's been around, but it's around right now a whole lot because the Tea Party movement is so much bigger.
[00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:59.443]  But I can remember in 1996, and I don't know exactly what you were doing in 96, but when I was trying to get back into Congress, both Republicans and Democrats said, well, this guy's crazy.
[00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:03.344]  He's even critical of the federal war on drugs.
[00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:08.085]  Anybody that's critical on the war on drugs must mean he wants to give drugs to kids.
[00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:09.366]  You know, that sort of thing.
[00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:21.995]  So they tried real hard to demonize me then, but I came back with honest answers that said, in other words, drugs don't work, I don't want to use drugs, I don't want to use drugs on my kids, I take care of women delivering babies.
[00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:24.857]  They emphasized the evil and the harm of drugs.
[00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:26.719]  You know, we won that argument.
[00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:32.724]  So, they will always try to demonize individuals, but more so today than ever before.
[00:04:32.904 --> 00:04:35.747]  Because, like you say, they were trying to turn it around.
[00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:41.912]  Just because we oppose something Obama proposes, oh, you must be a racist.
[00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:44.295]  You know, it's the demagogues that really fucked me.
[00:04:46.167 --> 00:05:04.791]  But well in 96 I was interviewing you when you were getting back into office and I do remember that and they a few years ago had your head floating around out in space always trying to make you look like the outsider but as many newspapers have reported your views the Constitution my views are now the majority
[00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:09.518]  The establishment is desperate and is very, very afraid.
[00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:14.066]  What else do you see them from your years of research and experiencing this in Congress?
[00:05:14.406 --> 00:05:19.435]  What else do you think the big central banks and others are going to do to try to keep control of the people?
[00:05:20.418 --> 00:05:40.206]  Well, I think whatever they think is necessary, and I had some information passed on to me, sort of inside information of somebody who knew somebody that was well-tuned to the people at the Federal Reserve, and they said they are really, really concerned about our movement to expose the Fed for what they're doing.
[00:05:40.587 --> 00:05:45.809]  Not so much that they think tomorrow we're going to have a victory and have a thorough audit and the Fed is going to end.
[00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:58.038]  But what they're upset or worried about is the fact that more and more people are aware of the Federal Reserve now, like never before, and exposure is the most important thing.
[00:05:58.078 --> 00:06:00.540]  Then the changes will come and the reforms will come.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.701]  So they know exactly what we've been talking about.
[00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:10.047]  I think that's where we've had such a tremendous success in the freedom movement in the last decade or so, is that people have become aware.
[00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:18.414]  Of the power of the Federal Reserve, and I'm so delighted when I go to the universities, and the next generation will know about the Federal Reserve.
[00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:22.278]  The Federal Reserve was something you never even learned about in college.
[00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:24.440]  I mean, they just fluffed over this.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.360]  It was important.
[00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:26.521]  They took care of us.
[00:06:26.581 --> 00:06:28.063]  They knew how to run the economy.
[00:06:28.423 --> 00:06:33.808]  That has ended, and I think even those who defend the Fed are very frightened about it.
[00:06:34.068 --> 00:06:37.650]  Did you have a chance to see Zbigniew Brzezinski's speech to the CFR last week?
[00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:44.674]  Because he said, for the first time in world history, the planet is awake to us and our move for global government.
[00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:46.895]  And he basically said, we are in trouble.
[00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:53.919]  I didn't see that, but I hope he has some real reasons to be worried about that.
[00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:59.922]  But was it Biden that said the other day that Brussels should be the capital for the free world or something like that?
[00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:04.066]  Yeah, they're really coming out in the open with their world government because we've exposed it.
[00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:07.747]  I want to run rapid fire now through a bunch of different issues while we have you.
[00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:14.129]  We're very honored to have Congressman Ron Paul with us today live on the 26th day of May 2010.
[00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.390]  You mentioned the war on drugs.
[00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:29.735]  I saw an interview with you back in the late 1980s and you were talking about the CIA who'd been caught shipping in heroin then and a few months ago you gave a speech and said there's been a CIA coup.
[00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:31.697]  Uh, in America.
[00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:39.607]  Uh, since then, it's been in the New York Times, the Washington Post, AFP, French News Agency, and even Geraldo Rivera on Fox.
[00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:46.396]  They go, yes, our troops are helping grow the opium for the farmers, because if they don't, Al-Qaeda will get it and sell it.
[00:07:46.917 --> 00:07:54.882]  What an amazing move to go from denying that they're producing it and shipping a lot of it in to saying, oh yes, we have to or Al-Qaeda would get it.
[00:07:55.142 --> 00:08:03.267]  Well, if you just decriminalized it, that would take the money out and then Al-Qaeda, as they call it, wouldn't... I mean, that was the excuse on the crack cocaine.
[00:08:03.507 --> 00:08:06.669]  Well, we've got to ship the cocaine in or the communists, you know, will get the money.
[00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.191]  Can you speak to that, sir?
[00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:23.944]  Well, I don't have the absolute proof of it, but my suspicion is, and just because of the stories you hear, I think they really want drugs to be illegal, because I think that's the way they raise money for their governments is off the books.
[00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:33.133]  You know, they own banks, they can get involved in enterprise, and they have to get their cash, and it never comes through
[00:08:34.273 --> 00:08:35.014]  Well, not all of it.
[00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:43.497]  Some of it will come through appropriations and legally, even though we don't know where it goes and who controls it, but they even need even more money because they're doing so much.
[00:08:43.517 --> 00:08:45.338]  There's so much activity going on.
[00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:53.441]  So, in many ways, they are very, very powerful, and it is in their interest to keep the drug war going.
[00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:56.802]  So, it's a bit of an irony that some very, very sincere
[00:08:58.323 --> 00:09:04.548]  Church-believing people who want to take care of the kids believe that, you know, we have to keep this war going.
[00:09:04.908 --> 00:09:12.534]  At the same time, they're allies, inadvertently allies, with the drug dealers who want the drugs to be kept illegal.
[00:09:12.794 --> 00:09:16.577]  And then you point out, well, that the government and the CIA is involved as well.
[00:09:17.318 --> 00:09:35.092]  Well, Congressman, I know you're super busy and none of us can be on top of everything, but would you like us to send you a packet of mainstream news where they just calmly admit that, okay, our troops... I mean, they had Aroldo Rivera with a Marine Corps commander, with the troops, explaining why they helped the farmers grow the opium.
[00:09:35.152 --> 00:09:38.855]  I mean, they're now basically bringing this out and hiding it in plain view.
[00:09:40.655 --> 00:09:45.077]  Well, I've seen some of that, but I can always look at more material when it's available.
[00:09:45.238 --> 00:09:47.239]  Well, here's one more issue on that subject.
[00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:50.300]  Did you see the Washington Post two days ago?
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:50.881]  C.I.A.
[00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:53.942]  units, wacky idea, depicts Saddam as gay.
[00:09:54.382 --> 00:09:57.984]  And then in the article, it quotes them as admitting that the C.I.A.
[00:09:58.024 --> 00:10:01.426]  put out at least one fake Osama bin Laden video.
[00:10:01.987 --> 00:10:04.128]  That sounds like that should be a congressional investigation.
[00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:09.254]  Yeah, there's so many things that should be congressional investigations.
[00:10:10.415 --> 00:10:14.236]  Sometimes, though, it becomes difficult if you hear of a real problem.
[00:10:14.676 --> 00:10:16.376]  I think, well, I guess I ought to report this.
[00:10:16.496 --> 00:10:17.137]  Where should I go?
[00:10:17.157 --> 00:10:20.017]  The FBI and the CIA, and they'll investigate it for me?
[00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:22.678]  Well, who's going to investigate the investigators?
[00:10:23.278 --> 00:10:31.921]  And that's our job, and that's what our responsibility is, to hopefully wake up enough people to find out who to believe and who not to believe.
[00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:49.273]  Congressman, getting into what's happening on the economic front, we read your quotes a few weeks ago about Bernie Sanders, paraphrasing, you know, basically, he sold out, or he flip-flopped, and then Grayson running around saying, we beat the Fed.
[00:10:49.293 --> 00:10:53.295]  I mean, you're the real expert in Congress recognized on this with the Fed.
[00:10:53.615 --> 00:10:54.356]  What really happened?
[00:10:55.555 --> 00:11:02.720]  Well, we got 1207 passed into the House Reform Bill, and that bill passed on the House floor.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.020]  The big vote was in the committee.
[00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:07.122]  So that's in there, even though it's in a very bad bill.
[00:11:07.703 --> 00:11:12.466]  When it got to the Senate, Bernie Sanders is the one who introduced 1207 and 604, I believe, in the Senate.
[00:11:14.347 --> 00:11:22.413]  And at the last minute, he changed his mind and took what the establishment agreed to, another severely watered-down version of it.
[00:11:22.453 --> 00:11:28.497]  It wasn't really an audit, it was just a glimpse of what's been going on for the past two years, which it had already agreed to.
[00:11:29.057 --> 00:11:40.926]  But it passed, I think, 96-0, and the administration agreed to it, Obama signed it, and Democratic and Republican leadership agreed to that.
[00:11:41.616 --> 00:11:50.759]  And then the 1207 version was brought up by Vitter, and when that got to the Senate floor, we only got 37 votes.
[00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:58.102]  So I think people should pay attention to those who did not vote for the real audit language in the Senate.
[00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:03.784]  And this, to me, is a bailout for the system and for the Federal Reserve.
[00:12:04.344 --> 00:12:08.809]  But now they have finally passed that version in the Senate and it's going to conference.
[00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:15.737]  So I'm trying to keep an eye on that very closely and see if we can influence the conference.
[00:12:20.025 --> 00:12:34.099]  I just don't know whether we could get that modified or what will happen, but I think right now the cars are stacked against us, but we're going to keep fighting because the more tension we get and the more the people know, I think we can
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.264]  I'd be proud of how far we've gotten already and how much people know about it.
[00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:40.685]  Well, that's right, Congressman.
[00:12:40.945 --> 00:12:43.948]  25 years ago, you didn't get one co-sponsor when you were first in Congress.
[00:12:44.248 --> 00:12:46.189]  Now you passed it in the House, it went to the Senate.
[00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:53.856]  I saw a headline where you were saying that those that voted against your audit, the Fed bill, will be held accountable, though, by the voters.
[00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:55.317]  Oh yeah, they should be.
[00:12:55.737 --> 00:12:58.879]  You think of the Republicans?
[00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:00.880]  We'll retaliate against Republicans.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.481]  We saw that in Utah.
[00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:05.102]  These votes are very important.
[00:13:05.882 --> 00:13:13.266]  The bailout vote was crucial in a lot of this stimulus for the Tea Party movement.
[00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:19.009]  This is just another vote that we can use and help alert the people.
[00:13:19.997 --> 00:13:22.358]  We've only got about six minutes left with Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:23.458]  His time is so precious.
[00:13:23.478 --> 00:13:30.460]  We're going to give you some websites before he leaves so you can get involved in the Campaign for Liberty or Rand Paul's campaign, which is so important.
[00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:41.084]  But looking at the border situation, the Deputy Homeland Security Director said last Friday that they may not process illegals referred to them from Arizona.
[00:13:41.444 --> 00:13:44.025]  I've already seen previous reports of where sheriffs and others
[00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:49.367]  You know, so much can be solved with our use of our Constitution and the principle of private property.
[00:14:04.654 --> 00:14:15.528]  If you have somebody walking your house, and they're trespassing, and they might not have even committed a crime, they might not have, you know, shot anybody or stolen anything yet, they trespass, just trespass.
[00:14:15.568 --> 00:14:18.572]  And they walk in your house, and they have no right to be there.
[00:14:19.093 --> 00:14:22.217]  We call the police, and the police call them, and they prosecute them.
[00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:28.260]  But they don't apply that to people who are walking across this land and walking across these branches.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.221]  As a matter of fact, even if you do anything to stop trespassers, you can get into trouble.
[00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:34.022]  You're taking the law into your own hands.
[00:14:34.322 --> 00:14:36.723]  The states aren't allowed to do what they should do.
[00:14:37.163 --> 00:14:44.106]  And when the states finally get totally frustrated, you know, they have to pass a law that then is argued about.
[00:14:44.187 --> 00:14:51.750]  I have some reservations about that law, but not about the intent and what they're trying to do and the dereliction of duty of the federal government.
[00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:55.064]  I would like to see more approach to this.
[00:14:56.437 --> 00:15:08.844]  If you can't get them at the border and stop the influx, then as soon as they apply for benefits, then that's when we should deal with it.
[00:15:09.104 --> 00:15:09.484]  I agree.
[00:15:09.564 --> 00:15:12.366]  Deny them the welfare benefits and that will stop.
[00:15:12.606 --> 00:15:14.467]  But the government again wants this dependent group.
[00:15:15.107 --> 00:15:24.492]  Were you in the chamber when Calderon lectured and said, repass the assault weapons ban, effectively taking semi-automatics from American people?
[00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:27.918]  Nope, I wasn't there, and that's a personal thing with me.
[00:15:28.358 --> 00:15:31.320]  There's a limit to what I can actually tolerate some days.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:37.102]  So, I did listen to it on TV and all, but I didn't feel like I should be present.
[00:15:37.952 --> 00:15:39.133]  Did that disgust you?
[00:15:39.153 --> 00:15:48.462]  Oh yeah, I mean it disgusts me, but I knew what he was going to say, and why do we give... I mean, about a couple years ago they had Karzai down there.
[00:15:48.482 --> 00:15:53.927]  I mean, Karzai is, you know, just our henchman that we have a hard gun.
[00:15:54.527 --> 00:16:01.934]  And to have him here down there as a head of a state and talking to a joint session of Congress, I mean, that's more than I
[00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:07.591]  Well, his brother is admittedly, even in the New York Times, the top opium king.
[00:16:08.152 --> 00:16:10.413]  Yeah.
[00:16:10.794 --> 00:16:13.756]  And one of these days, you know, we'll depose him.
[00:16:14.276 --> 00:16:15.237]  Something will happen.
[00:16:15.397 --> 00:16:16.197]  He'll be gone.
[00:16:16.257 --> 00:16:22.562]  And, you know, the big thing over there right now is this battle is about to start in Afghanistan.
[00:16:22.642 --> 00:16:28.406]  And there's no guarantees that even with all our military might that we're going to have a military victory there.
[00:16:28.466 --> 00:16:30.067]  We will not have a political victory.
[00:16:30.127 --> 00:16:31.008]  It'll be a political
[00:16:31.608 --> 00:16:32.109]  I think so.
[00:16:44.363 --> 00:16:47.485]  Well, Congressman, that's part of my last two questions, then we'll let you go.
[00:16:47.945 --> 00:17:01.294]  Specifically, with the entire geopolitical situation, North Korea on a war footing, the Pentagon saying they're ready for war, meanwhile our own government helped give the reactors to North Korea, as you know.
[00:17:02.095 --> 00:17:08.619]  You've got Israel saying they may strike Iran, Obama saying he would support them if they did.
[00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:16.805]  You've got the Predator drones, a thousand of them now, going in to Pakistan, which many experts say is an act of war.
[00:17:16.885 --> 00:17:19.687]  You've said the Iran sanctions are an act of war.
[00:17:19.707 --> 00:17:23.970]  I mean, it looks like the build-up to World War I or World War II.
[00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.252]  Can you speak to the overall atmosphere?
[00:17:26.652 --> 00:17:29.334]  And does the system have a desire to have a world crisis?
[00:17:29.554 --> 00:17:32.677]  And then finally, what do you see with the EU meltdown?
[00:17:34.278 --> 00:17:44.482]  Well, you know, it sort of blows my mind when I think about our financial crisis and not only the meltdown of the European nations, but ours as well.
[00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:55.146]  And they hardly blink an eye that they can talk about spreading this war in the Middle East into Iran, to continue the civilian CIA bombing of these various countries.
[00:17:55.646 --> 00:18:01.007]  But this thing, Korea, it's way out of proportion to what we should be doing.
[00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:11.350]  I resent the fact that a generation or two ago, we have signed these treaties, have been involved, and have troops in Korea all that time, and we're just sitting there.
[00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.370]  If there's ever a problem, we get dragged into it.
[00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.791]  But this week, we had a resolution on the House floor.
[00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:17.531]  There were three of us that voted against it.
[00:18:18.111 --> 00:18:21.992]  And the resolution was essentially an authorization to go do whatever is necessary.
[00:18:22.712 --> 00:18:29.135]  And the circumstances that we live today, you never come to the Congress and make a declaration of war.
[00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:31.316]  We have these so-called promises.
[00:18:31.856 --> 00:18:38.619]  How can one generation promise the next generation that we will deliver all the money and all the soldiers that will be necessary?
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.061]  We should just bring ourselves out of those situations.
[00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:45.142]  But this thing was just overwhelmingly passed.
[00:18:45.162 --> 00:18:46.083]  It was billed as
[00:18:46.523 --> 00:18:51.428]  You know, expressing our concerns and our condolences for the people who died there.
[00:18:51.628 --> 00:19:00.196]  And then at the bottom it gives the authority to say, and we do authorize, you know, whatever force and whatever is necessary to take care of this problem.
[00:19:00.674 --> 00:19:02.535]  Well, it's the same thing with the finances in Europe.
[00:19:02.595 --> 00:19:03.495]  Same thing that happened here.
[00:19:03.855 --> 00:19:07.257]  Taking the pension funds, raising the taxes, VAT taxes.
[00:19:07.697 --> 00:19:11.618]  Europe is now sinking into the central bank design trap.
[00:19:11.978 --> 00:19:18.761]  In closing, you've been talking about a total global meltdown for a long time, based on derivatives, Dr. Paul.
[00:19:19.902 --> 00:19:23.203]  Now it looks like we're approaching the vortex.
[00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:33.500]  Yeah, we're getting awfully close, and people try to get me to say when I think it's going to happen, and I don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but I know it is unsustainable.
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.005]  Because the dollar is still being trusted, and that is a subjective event.
[00:19:38.065 --> 00:19:41.350]  People subjectively still say, well, we can trust the dollar.
[00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.171]  It is the world currency.
[00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:45.592]  But eventually, they'll lose trust in the dollar.
[00:19:45.692 --> 00:19:54.716]  And I think if you look at the devaluation of the dollar against gold, you realize that something big is going on right now.
[00:19:54.796 --> 00:20:03.260]  Because up until a month or two ago, the gold and the dollar always was related to the stock market and other currencies and commodities.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.663]  But right now, more people are seeing the devaluation of the dollar against gold, which is the ultimate measurement
[00:20:10.223 --> 00:20:16.049]  And that means that the time is getting much closer to the rejection of the system.
[00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:17.550]  I mean, the Europeans are broke.
[00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.012]  We're bailing them out with dollars.
[00:20:19.032 --> 00:20:20.233]  How about the cities?
[00:20:20.293 --> 00:20:20.794]  They're broke.
[00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:27.220]  Are we going to let cities and states fail after bailing out Wall Street and bailing out Greece?
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.521]  There's no way.
[00:20:28.941 --> 00:20:37.365]  They're always going to come to the rescue, print the money, and they're going to inflate until the point when the people are holding the dollars overseas say, we're spending them.
[00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:39.486]  The Chinese are pretty smart people.
[00:20:39.726 --> 00:20:40.987]  They're spending those dollars.
[00:20:41.427 --> 00:20:47.270]  They're around buying natural resources around the world with dollars they earn from us.
[00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:55.855]  At the same time, we think we have to protect our natural resources by invading countries and occupying and protecting our oil.
[00:20:56.336 --> 00:20:57.846]  We have lost our way.
[00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:07.712]  And clearly we have a revolution of liberty and freedom, a restoration of the Republic, led by yourself and Rand Paul.
[00:21:08.413 --> 00:21:19.118]  Give us the websites for people to get involved with your campaign, with Campaign for Liberty, with Rand, with everybody in putting out the alternative to the New World Order.
[00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:26.122]  Well, all my websites can be found by RandPaul.org, and I think Rand's is RandPaul.com.
[00:21:27.263 --> 00:21:30.345]  RonPaul.org will get you to about six of my websites.
[00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:32.626]  Congressman, thank you so much for the time.
[00:21:32.647 --> 00:21:33.967]  We look forward to speaking to you in the future.
[00:21:34.007 --> 00:21:34.428]  God bless.
[00:21:34.528 --> 00:21:34.888]  Thank you.
[00:21:35.829 --> 00:21:43.054]  All right, there goes Congressman Ron Paul, and I skipped that network break, the limited time that we had with him.
[00:21:43.074 --> 00:21:53.382]  I just want to commend the great job my crew has been doing, and I also want to thank all the listeners and the AM and FM affiliates
[00:21:54.284 --> 00:22:23.342]  uh... out there in fact you guys gave me a list yesterday in just the last week of six new affiliates and of course uh... as soon as i meant to go to that to plug it i don't have it here maybe you can reprint that but you know you know we're reaching more people every day i mean this radio show it's scary
[00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:25.440]  How many people we're reaching?
[00:22:28.786 --> 00:22:30.028]  And I don't know how to explain it.
[00:22:30.168 --> 00:22:38.702]  I have a constant enraging frustration that I am not doing a good enough job breaking all this down.
[00:22:41.357 --> 00:22:44.239]  And then I look at other people, and I'm fighting as hard as I can.
[00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:47.041]  I see other people out there, and they could care less about what's happening in the world.
[00:22:47.342 --> 00:22:51.345]  They think it's funny that some of us care what's happening and are involved in warning people.
[00:22:51.365 --> 00:22:54.547]  You know, we're on the verge of World War III right now.
[00:22:54.888 --> 00:23:00.792]  I was watching Senate debate yesterday, and senator after senator was saying, we're on the verge of a total world collapse.
[00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:03.454]  And I still watch the idiot yuppies out there.
[00:23:03.474 --> 00:23:06.697]  They're just giggling and laughing and running around like a bunch of fools.
[00:23:06.897 --> 00:23:08.558]  I am genuinely freaked out, folks.
[00:23:09.239 --> 00:23:10.260]  And I'm supposed to be!
[00:23:12.073 --> 00:23:20.101]  You know, go back 5,000 years ago, and you're in some little tribe, and you're out, you know, with your kids by the river, and 10 wolves run up.
[00:23:20.521 --> 00:23:25.185]  You're supposed to get in a circle with your spears and, you know, tell the wolves to back off.
[00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:29.750]  And we're surrounded by wolves.
[00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.352]  I'm watching them drag whole countries down.
[00:23:32.372 --> 00:23:34.814]  I watched the millions they've killed in the last 10 years.
[00:23:37.455 --> 00:23:41.057]  My God, I watch them forcing vaccines on kids they know are killing them.
[00:23:41.618 --> 00:23:42.938]  I know they're poisoning the water.
[00:23:44.379 --> 00:23:47.301]  They admit they're making fake Bin Laden videos in the Washington Post.
[00:23:47.501 --> 00:23:48.922]  They admit they're growing the opium.
[00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:50.623]  And I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:23:50.643 --> 00:23:51.524]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:23:51.884 --> 00:24:01.950]  It's sickening if I just sit here calmly like the average talk show host all puffed up and cover the news and talk about how I'm a patriot and just cover the issues.
[00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.992]  I've got to be honest with you.
[00:24:05.712 --> 00:24:06.633]  Okay, just how
[00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:15.377]  You know, I know why I'm frustrated, because at a primitive level, my brain is saying, attack these people.
[00:24:16.345 --> 00:24:17.286]  I mean, that's really what it is.
[00:24:17.366 --> 00:24:18.767]  I've really been analyzing myself.
[00:24:19.487 --> 00:24:24.290]  At a primitive level, my brain is saying you should be physically going up against the government.
[00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.911]  But I'm not calling for that.
[00:24:26.191 --> 00:24:27.192]  I know that's instinct.
[00:24:27.692 --> 00:24:28.853]  I understand they want that.
[00:24:28.893 --> 00:24:30.454]  This is a 21st century war.
[00:24:30.894 --> 00:24:31.855]  It's an info war.
[00:24:32.395 --> 00:24:38.960]  But more and more I understand what my problem is, especially lately, because everything's coming down, everything's been proven correct.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.941]  You think I get happy when I'm proven right?
[00:24:42.242 --> 00:24:43.162]  You think I like this?
[00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:43.963]  You think this is fun?
[00:24:45.469 --> 00:24:48.071]  Yeah, I see these other Patriot groups were enjoying themselves.
[00:24:48.131 --> 00:24:52.835]  It's like some kind of social thing, and they compete with each other on all this crud.
[00:24:53.976 --> 00:24:55.577]  We're not competing with each other, folks.
[00:24:55.617 --> 00:24:58.079]  We're fighting for our lives against the New World Order.
[00:25:03.303 --> 00:25:04.884]  I mean, just everything is verified.
[00:25:04.984 --> 00:25:10.729]  I mean, I knew they were shipping drugs in, but to have them admit it... I knew they were putting out fake bin Laden videos, but to have them admit it...
[00:25:12.054 --> 00:25:24.003]  I knew they're putting poison in the water, but to read textbooks about how they're doing it to us, and now they admit they're chemtrailing us, and the public still can't even admit it, and it just goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on!
[00:25:25.064 --> 00:25:26.445]  It just doesn't have to happen!
[00:25:27.046 --> 00:25:28.087]  If we just wake up!
[00:25:28.587 --> 00:25:29.568]  If men were men!

[00:25:42.219 --> 00:25:50.344]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:25:50.704 --> 00:26:01.151]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:26:01.591 --> 00:26:07.035]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:26:07.595 --> 00:26:12.058]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.

[00:26:46.524 --> 00:26:49.487]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:26:55.773 --> 00:26:56.454]  Big Brother.
[00:26:57.095 --> 00:26:58.076]  Mainstream media.

[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.101]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:07.344]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:07.924 --> 00:27:12.047]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:13.148 --> 00:27:22.074]  I'm gonna be just honest with people.
[00:27:22.094 --> 00:27:24.916]  I'm gonna open the phones up.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:33.125]  And get your take on the North Korea situation, the Arizona situation, the global financial meltdown.
[00:27:35.826 --> 00:27:40.710]  I can't believe, I just can't believe the general public isn't up in arms.
[00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.011]  I don't understand it.
[00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:44.372]  I don't know why other people aren't like me.
[00:27:44.653 --> 00:27:50.877]  Why they don't want to be informed, why they don't want to be involved, why they don't care about their kids, why they don't care about anything.
[00:27:52.247 --> 00:28:06.579]  See, the sick thing about it is, is that I've gotten more wise, and I've studied a lot of history and philosophy, and I understand now that it seemed like ten minutes ago that I was five years old.
[00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:13.664]  And ten minutes from now, in the scheme of time, I'm going to be eighty years old, if I'm blessed to live that long, and I'm going to be dead!
[00:28:14.685 --> 00:28:16.667]  And more and more, I could care less about myself.
[00:28:16.867 --> 00:28:18.448]  I care about my fellow man.
[00:28:19.089 --> 00:28:21.491]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young, whatever it is.
[00:28:22.614 --> 00:28:26.899]  And I'm tired of people being manipulated and lied to and poisoned and dumbed down.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.162]  I have kinship with humanity.
[00:28:30.964 --> 00:28:32.927]  I realize that that is the immortality.
[00:28:33.247 --> 00:28:35.790]  The sure immortality is through the species.
[00:28:36.914 --> 00:28:38.295]  And I really love my children.
[00:28:38.936 --> 00:28:40.217]  I really want them to be free.
[00:28:40.697 --> 00:28:45.462]  Back when I was a teenager, I always heard politicians say it's for the children, think about future generations.
[00:28:46.222 --> 00:28:49.986]  And I knew they were manipulating people because adults, you know, cared about children.
[00:28:50.206 --> 00:28:54.029]  But now that I am a parent, I really understand why they pull that string.
[00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.912]  It's a counterfeit of, we should do everything for our children.
[00:28:59.194 --> 00:28:59.874]  And their children.
[00:29:00.675 --> 00:29:03.978]  If you could meet your great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren,
[00:29:05.228 --> 00:29:08.851]  On some future space station, or Mars, or, you know, here on the planet.
[00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:16.177]  Wouldn't you love them, that little toddler, that little two-year-old, your great-great-great-great-granddaughter or son, as much as you love your own children?
[00:29:21.001 --> 00:29:22.222]  And we're not going to have that future.
[00:29:22.242 --> 00:29:24.344]  They're going to set up their world government and kill most of us.
[00:29:25.205 --> 00:29:28.387]  And the worst people of our species are running things.
[00:29:29.248 --> 00:29:31.190]  And they think they're the best because they're so ruthless.
[00:29:33.294 --> 00:29:46.706]  And I am just frustrated that I... I'm just frustrated that they're always there laughing at us and leering and admitting all their evil and still the cowardly public sits there buying into it, going along with it.
[00:29:53.011 --> 00:29:54.072]  It's just so real!
[00:29:54.132 --> 00:29:55.393]  It's so admitted!
[00:29:55.653 --> 00:29:56.074]  All of it!
[00:30:01.417 --> 00:30:03.738]  And I'm tired of bad people winning.
[00:30:06.699 --> 00:30:11.020]  I'm tired of corrupt people getting away with their evil.
[00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:20.082]  I'm tired of how unconscious the public is.
[00:30:24.504 --> 00:30:25.904]  I'm tired of how weak I am.
[00:30:35.489 --> 00:30:38.830]  I mean, you know, I knew they were chemtrailing us 15 years ago.
[00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.911]  And then I, in the last three, they just admit they're doing it now and it's no big deal?
[00:30:47.192 --> 00:30:49.433]  They admit they know it's poison they're putting in the water?
[00:30:49.493 --> 00:30:53.054]  They know the vaccines are full of cancer viruses, by design?
[00:30:53.074 --> 00:30:57.755]  And they come out and say, oh, this children's vaccine is good, so what if it has viruses in it?
[00:31:02.574 --> 00:31:04.795]  And they're playing everyone off against each other.
[00:31:05.436 --> 00:31:13.139]  Look, I got a bunch of news coming up, and we're going to get into how the financial scam, one of the main pillars of the New World Order system, that if we expose this, we can bring them down.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.041]  And I was talking about this, you know, 12 years ago.
[00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:19.403]  Most people were laughing at me, but now it's become a mainstream news issue.
[00:31:20.043 --> 00:31:20.904]  And that's very exciting.
[00:31:20.944 --> 00:31:21.984]  Walter Burian coming up.
[00:31:22.004 --> 00:31:24.786]  But I do want to open the phones up in this hour.
[00:31:24.806 --> 00:31:24.866]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:31:29.768 --> 00:31:30.268]  800-259-9231.
[00:31:31.388 --> 00:31:39.230]  And we will get you up and on the air today on any of these issues, any of these items you want to discuss.
[00:31:41.011 --> 00:31:44.732]  And I've got $1,000 fines for not paying on the toll roads in Texas.
[00:31:44.772 --> 00:31:46.532]  Of course, they don't even tell you you're on a toll road.
[00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:47.993]  It's license plate reading.
[00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:49.233]  We'll cover that as well.
[00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:52.261]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:57.663]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:57.903 --> 00:32:02.525]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:02.905 --> 00:32:03.305]  It's true.
[00:32:03.385 --> 00:32:07.947]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:32:08.487 --> 00:32:13.190]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:13.711 --> 00:32:15.632]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:32:16.032 --> 00:32:20.635]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:21.736]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:21.936 --> 00:32:24.718]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:32:24.998 --> 00:32:28.320]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:31.482]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:31.823 --> 00:32:33.724]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:34.044 --> 00:32:34.965]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:38.607 --> 00:32:40.388]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:47.353]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:50.115]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:56.540]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:57.781 --> 00:33:02.544]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:33:02.924 --> 00:33:04.405]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:33:06.994 --> 00:33:09.716]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:33:11.638 --> 00:33:13.980]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:33:15.701 --> 00:33:18.184]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:33:18.484 --> 00:33:24.029]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:33:24.729 --> 00:33:27.792]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:33:29.783 --> 00:33:31.665]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:33:31.946 --> 00:33:33.427]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:33:33.727 --> 00:33:36.270]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:42.857]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.962]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:33:48.323 --> 00:33:48.803]  Others don't.
[00:33:54.764 --> 00:33:55.685]  Tyranny is here.
[00:33:56.025 --> 00:33:59.567]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:33:59.587 --> 00:34:02.209]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:07.653]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:34:08.053 --> 00:34:14.297]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:34:14.717 --> 00:34:20.262]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:34:20.702 --> 00:34:24.385]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:34:24.885 --> 00:34:28.889]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:34.693]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:38.116]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:34:38.677 --> 00:34:40.098]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:34:40.658 --> 00:34:41.079]  It's here.

[00:34:51.885 --> 00:34:57.528]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:01.111 --> 00:35:08.335]  North Korea is run by a 5'1", power-tripping demon.
[00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.851]  Who the U.S.
[00:35:10.891 --> 00:35:16.716]  government and the Swiss government, the O'Donnell Rumsfeld, gave nuclear weapons material to, on record.
[00:35:18.732 --> 00:35:28.136]  They have a joint factory on their border as part of an aid system to the north where they have to give them the fuel oil and the grain and everything else.
[00:35:28.176 --> 00:35:33.378]  And the north, since they're always threatening them if they don't give them more, being a... That's what our government is.
[00:35:33.418 --> 00:35:37.660]  It's a big corrupt murdering parasite that says, give me all your tax money.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.420]  I got troops in black uniforms.
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.001]  We'll come SWAT team you.
[00:35:41.241 --> 00:35:43.382]  The IRS admits they use fear to control you.
[00:35:44.022 --> 00:35:45.263]  It all goes to offshore banks.
[00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:46.424]  Same thing with North Korea.
[00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:51.507]  They just sit there with nuclear weapons saying, we'll start World War III with you if you don't give us all this free money.
[00:35:53.548 --> 00:35:56.210]  And our government goes, you're just like us.
[00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:57.430]  Here's some nuclear weapons.
[00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:58.191]  We love you.
[00:35:58.691 --> 00:36:00.652]  We need to have a threat out there.
[00:36:01.633 --> 00:36:12.860]  And right on time, as the global financial collapse unfolds, North Korea raises its head, it rears its ugly head, and torpedoes a ship, and is running around threatening everyone.
[00:36:14.266 --> 00:36:18.628]  North Korea expels South Korean officials from Joint Factory Park.
[00:36:19.368 --> 00:36:20.789]  It's owned by the North and the South.
[00:36:21.449 --> 00:36:22.490]  And they're just kicking them out.
[00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:29.193]  And they're now cruising their ships around on the edge of South Korean water, saying they're going to go ahead and attack them.
[00:36:30.274 --> 00:36:34.916]  And they're trying to play chicken to get even more money and power.
[00:36:37.054 --> 00:36:39.236]  And, you know, this guy is reportedly dying of cancer.
[00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:44.700]  And these lunatics, you know, like Hitler in his bunkers, said, go ahead and take Berlin down with me.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:52.966]  You know, flood the tube stations, the underground train systems.
[00:36:55.448 --> 00:36:56.809]  And they said, well, that'll kill our own people.
[00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:57.510]  And he said, so what?
[00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:58.070]  They deserve it.
[00:36:58.711 --> 00:37:01.053]  So, you know, who knows what this lunatic's going to do?
[00:37:02.236 --> 00:37:02.718]  Who knows?
[00:37:02.779 --> 00:37:07.016]  I mean, this is always government and some lunatic with a military that works for them.
[00:37:08.307 --> 00:37:12.530]  Which is the direction we're going, where the government is God, where the state is God.
[00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:19.175]  North Korea expels South Korean official from joint factory park, further fueling tensions between the Koreas.
[00:37:19.235 --> 00:37:32.185]  North Korea kicks South Korea government officials out of their joint factory park in the north on Wednesday and threatened to shut it down if Seoul resumes its anti-North Korean broadcast along the border.
[00:37:33.274 --> 00:37:43.264]  The North, accused of seeking the South Korean warship in the Yellow Sea in March, also renewed its threat to shoot South Korean loudspeakers if South sets them up on its side.
[00:37:45.046 --> 00:37:46.047]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:37:46.067 --> 00:37:46.327]  Here it is.
[00:37:46.367 --> 00:37:50.251]  North Korea threatens to close border with South as relations worsen.
[00:37:50.612 --> 00:37:56.458]  As Hillary Clinton arrives in Seoul to discuss the crisis, the North expels eight South Korean officials.
[00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:02.490]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.431]  They're like displaying parts of the torpedo and the rest of it now.
[00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:10.434]  And Israel's saying they want to go into Iran.
[00:38:11.994 --> 00:38:23.220]  Iran went to Turkey and to France and signed deals for them to enrich all the uranium for their peaceful nuclear reactors.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:29.743]  And Hillary put out a press release yesterday, last night, saying, this isn't good enough, we're still going to attack you, basically.
[00:38:31.007 --> 00:38:31.988]  I've got that here on the stack.
[00:38:32.008 --> 00:38:33.048]  I'm sure you've seen it on the news.
[00:38:34.089 --> 00:38:43.154]  And what's so incredible is, is that you notice in the sanctions they're trying to pass in the Congress, it says no refined gasoline can be shipped into Iran.
[00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:48.437]  Iran has lots of oil, but they only have about half the refining capacity they need for their country.
[00:38:49.457 --> 00:38:59.223]  So, our government's saying, we don't want you to have gasoline, and you can't have peaceful nuclear reactors to power your country, and your growing population of 67 million people.
[00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:07.095]  You cannot make a nuclear weapon with the material they want France and Turkey to produce.
[00:39:10.678 --> 00:39:17.205]  But North Korea could make A-bombs with what ABB and Donald Rumsfeld gave them, and they knowingly gave it to them.
[00:39:18.374 --> 00:39:22.835]  In 96, and with a second group of reactor systems in 2000.
[00:39:23.595 --> 00:39:26.136]  We've got articles up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:39:26.156 --> 00:39:26.776]  What's the headline?
[00:39:26.916 --> 00:39:28.517]  Watson put a good article out yesterday.
[00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:32.938]  Nuclear war in Korea brought to you by the US.
[00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:37.119]  Should be brought to you by the globalists, but whatever.
[00:39:37.139 --> 00:39:38.159]  Yeah, the US did do it.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.761]  And you heard Ron Paul mention last hour
[00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:54.192]  You heard the congressman mention last hour, here on the air, that, oh, the CIA is carrying out civilian bombings in Iran.
[00:39:55.213 --> 00:40:01.457]  In 2006, Bush put out a press release from the White House reporting what Cy Hirsch had already reported three years before.
[00:40:02.177 --> 00:40:02.697]  That U.S.
[00:40:02.737 --> 00:40:13.805]  Special Forces and four groups of Muslim terror groups, three of them out of Wahhabi Saudi Arabia, Sunni,
[00:40:15.037 --> 00:40:16.298]  I'm not bashing Sunnis here.
[00:40:16.318 --> 00:40:17.739]  I'm just talking about the groups they're using.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.001]  Attacking Shiite Iran.
[00:40:21.342 --> 00:40:25.244]  And then now it's back in the news the last two days that the generals, U.S.
[00:40:25.284 --> 00:40:29.267]  generals, are on the news saying, yes, we're launching attacks in Iran.
[00:40:29.948 --> 00:40:34.771]  Our criminal government is blowing up civilian targets inside Iran.
[00:40:35.292 --> 00:40:40.776]  And I know there's good old boys driving around in their pickup trucks right now going, good, I don't like them Arabs.
[00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:42.117]  Number one, they're not Arabs.
[00:40:43.581 --> 00:40:45.002]  Number two, that's an act of war.
[00:40:45.022 --> 00:40:54.410]  I mean, the Iranians have laid down, when our government blows up their jetliners to get them hopping mad, and stages overthrows of their government over and over again.
[00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.512]  I mean, it's so sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:57.773 --> 00:41:00.114]  The Iranians love America.
[00:41:00.975 --> 00:41:02.697]  They always wanted to be pro-America.
[00:41:03.697 --> 00:41:09.062]  Mohammad Mosaddegh was pro-US, till our government overthrew him using a bunch of radical Muslims!
[00:41:10.404 --> 00:41:11.525]  You just don't know history!
[00:41:11.745 --> 00:41:16.407]  Don't you dare sit there and say, kill them brown people before you know all about it!
[00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:19.648]  Don't sit there and play into this, you fool!
[00:41:19.988 --> 00:41:21.689]  I'm gonna tell those good ol' boys something again.
[00:41:22.089 --> 00:41:23.210]  You're not really good ol' boys.
[00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.091]  You don't know your head from a hole in the ground.
[00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:26.551]  And I'm gonna tell you this, too.
[00:41:27.592 --> 00:41:31.273]  If it's declassified that our government let the Russians have 22,000 U.S.
[00:41:31.293 --> 00:41:38.176]  troops that had been in German POW camps when the Russians took them over, if they will sell you out
[00:41:40.222 --> 00:41:46.267]  If they'll sell out the Iraqis, if they'll sell out the Iranians, if they'll sell out our own troops, they'll sell you out, Jack.
[00:41:46.527 --> 00:41:56.956]  So when they're taking your farm, or your ranch, or with taxes that you don't owe, taking your business... Just remember, buddy, you were into murder and death.
[00:41:57.036 --> 00:41:57.997]  You thought it was cool.
[00:41:58.277 --> 00:42:03.882]  You thought it was an extension of your manhood to watch shock and awe as Baghdad buildings blow up.
[00:42:04.643 --> 00:42:06.685]  Even if that was a just war, which it wasn't.
[00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.966]  You don't get off on buildings being blown up.
[00:42:10.226 --> 00:42:12.347]  You don't get off on dead women and children.
[00:42:12.687 --> 00:42:13.868]  It isn't tough, okay?
[00:42:14.808 --> 00:42:16.849]  And the truth is, you're all hat and no cattle.
[00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:27.134]  You know, it's this fake John Wayne-type persona, and it isn't real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:29.295 --> 00:42:29.575]  Okay?
[00:42:32.455 --> 00:42:38.497]  You know, it's one thing to have, even though it was staged, the Empire of Japan was corrupt and was a part of it.
[00:42:39.417 --> 00:42:40.838]  They got suckered into attacking.
[00:42:41.178 --> 00:42:41.618]  The U.S.
[00:42:41.638 --> 00:42:43.618]  had forces in China attacking them.
[00:42:45.399 --> 00:42:47.720]  They knew they were going to attack Pearl Harbor, they let them do it.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.701]  And then our troops went up, you know, Iwo Jima and all that, and that was heroic.
[00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:55.882]  But that's, this isn't your grandpa, your great-grandpa's war, folks.
[00:42:56.482 --> 00:42:58.143]  We are now the corrupt empire.
[00:42:59.482 --> 00:43:04.424]  But again, even if you signed on to a corrupt empire, you're not getting any of the booty.
[00:43:05.385 --> 00:43:15.670]  Like, say, a British middle-class person in 1800 got to be part of the empire and actually got something out of it.
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:23.484]  You're not getting jack squat out of this empire, except you're paying for it, and then everybody is hating you.
[00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:25.565]  Because the globalists are using the U.S.
[00:43:25.805 --> 00:43:32.289]  to set up their world government, and then at the same time blaming us for all the atrocities, so they can get rid of us at the end.
[00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:33.150]  You understand?
[00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:34.510]  That's how this is being done.
[00:43:35.671 --> 00:43:39.554]  All masterfully being maneuvered and set up and integrated.
[00:43:40.874 --> 00:43:41.815]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:43:41.935 --> 00:43:44.116]  Excellent article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:52.421]  Rothschild's engineer fire sale of UK infrastructure to offshore corporations.
[00:43:54.482 --> 00:44:12.277]  And he's got all the links to the mainstream news, talking about how the roads, the businesses, the infrastructure, the ports, all through this Rothschild holding company, just like they own the two big major carbon trading companies that you've got to buy your carbon credits from, just made up derivative.
[00:44:15.407 --> 00:44:22.616]  And they're financing Cintra of Spain and Portugal, taking over our roads here in Texas, 8,000 miles of them.
[00:44:24.218 --> 00:44:33.409]  Elitist banking dynasty pushes for toll roads that would privatize UK road network in rich coffers of same banking elite who have wreaked global economy.
[00:44:34.653 --> 00:44:35.673]  We've wrecked global economy.
[00:44:36.093 --> 00:44:51.118]  Rothschild banking family is pushing for the privatization of UK's motorway network that would force Brits who have already pay a road tax to enrich the coffers of the private corporations intimately tied to the Rothschilds by means of road tolls and pay-by-mile schemes enforced with spy cameras.
[00:44:51.578 --> 00:44:54.319]  And then it goes on to the mainstream media reports about it.
[00:44:54.639 --> 00:45:03.582]  But listen, in Texas, which is the main funding mechanism, and here's the article out of the TV station,
[00:45:05.679 --> 00:45:09.560]  That's reporting on this out of Houston, and I also heard this on local news yesterday.
[00:45:11.977 --> 00:45:41.301]  What happens is, they have now put license plate reading up on existing roads that taxpayer money paid for, and you drive through it, don't even know it's a toll road, and then you get, at your address, according to your driver's license database, they're in your database, this happened to me, you get like a $200 bill with, in my case, several hundred dollars of fines, and then I tried to pay it, and got more letters saying I hadn't paid it, and now the fines were bigger, and I had to get on the phone with the collection agency.
[00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:47.716]  And basically, it's like 40-something dollars in a couple of toll road trips turned into more than 400.
[00:45:48.096 --> 00:45:51.638]  Now, I told Charlie Hodge, a local talk show host, about this.
[00:45:51.658 --> 00:45:52.819]  He said the same thing happened to him.
[00:45:53.279 --> 00:45:55.661]  Here it is, but it gets worse.
[00:45:57.668 --> 00:46:04.936]  It says a $15 fee, it says a $1.25 how it begins, then it's a $15 fee, then it's $400, then it's $1,000, then it's $1,575, and they will not let you pay, and it gets better!
[00:46:04.976 --> 00:46:06.437]  They then go take your house!
[00:46:17.853 --> 00:46:20.414]  And all roads in Texas are to have this.
[00:46:20.754 --> 00:46:22.495]  It was called the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:46:22.535 --> 00:46:23.655]  They put up billboards everywhere.
[00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:25.095]  Rick Perry announced it.
[00:46:26.076 --> 00:46:32.818]  And then everybody got mad so he changed the name and they run CNN pieces attacking Ron Paul saying Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[00:46:33.198 --> 00:46:36.519]  Any Texan knows it was on the news and the stinking billboards were up.
[00:46:36.739 --> 00:46:38.020]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.621]  And it says right here, toll road violators could owe thousands in fines.
[00:46:42.441 --> 00:46:43.944]  Fines added to price of toll.
[00:46:44.024 --> 00:46:46.129]  No judge, no jury, no court.
[00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:48.052]  Private groups gang raping you.
[00:46:51.863 --> 00:46:56.146]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:48:50.615 --> 00:48:53.318]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:48:53.579 --> 00:48:57.523]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:48:57.723 --> 00:48:59.806]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:48:59.986 --> 00:49:05.032]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:49:05.172 --> 00:49:06.914]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:49:06.994 --> 00:49:08.296]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:49:08.516 --> 00:49:09.958]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:49:09.998 --> 00:49:13.101]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:49:13.381 --> 00:49:18.406]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:49:18.746 --> 00:49:27.835]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[00:51:08.905 --> 00:51:09.605]  Here's the issue.
[00:51:09.645 --> 00:51:15.747]  The globalists have decided they can't cover stuff up, so they're just going to admit everything, overwhelm everyone, or we just give in.
[00:51:16.067 --> 00:51:21.028]  Yeah, we're going to give you thousands of dollars of fines for a $1.25 toll road.
[00:51:21.368 --> 00:51:23.569]  There's no police, no judicial process.
[00:51:23.969 --> 00:51:31.111]  We're just going to give you a $1,570 fine, and we're going to put it in the Houston Chronicle and on Houston TV and tell you it's good.
[00:51:32.563 --> 00:51:38.104]  Yes, the CIA is going to be interviewed in the Washington Post and admit they put out fake Bin Laden videos.
[00:51:38.944 --> 00:51:45.585]  Yes, the CIA is going to go on TV and admit that they ship in and grow the opium.
[00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:52.726]  It's like the Fox News reporter going, what's the big deal?
[00:51:52.747 --> 00:51:54.127]  Everybody's saying they blew up Building 7.
[00:51:55.027 --> 00:52:00.768]  I was there that day and sure, I heard them say they were going to blow it up, but they didn't have to because it fell on its own.
[00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.273]  And Larry Silverstein's saying, yeah, we gave the decision to pull it, gave the order, watched it come down.
[00:52:05.513 --> 00:52:07.575]  We have all these cops on video saying, get back!
[00:52:07.815 --> 00:52:08.776]  They're going to blow it up!
[00:52:09.917 --> 00:52:12.179]  They're admitting they grow the opium and ship it in.
[00:52:12.319 --> 00:52:14.501]  They're admitting they make fake bin Laden videos.
[00:52:14.681 --> 00:52:16.403]  They're admittedly ripping everyone off.
[00:52:17.103 --> 00:52:18.224]  And they just don't care anymore.
[00:52:19.445 --> 00:52:29.094]  It's like Robert Rodriguez and the Film Commission saying they weren't getting any state funding, and now Aaron found the video of him with the governor saying, thank you for the $30 million for Machete, Governor.
[00:52:30.287 --> 00:52:34.911]  Him with the governor, and the governor's running around lying and saying they didn't fund it.
[00:52:35.271 --> 00:52:35.872]  I just can't.
[00:52:38.594 --> 00:52:46.340]  They have made a conscious decision to just lie about everything, simultaneously admitting everything.
[00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:50.444]  This is why I'm flipping out right now.
[00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:56.849]  Top construction firm WTC destroyed by controlled demolition.
[00:52:57.229 --> 00:52:59.251]  Veteran Middle East correspondent Alan Hart
[00:53:00.572 --> 00:53:01.872]  This is a big BBC reporter.
[00:53:02.253 --> 00:53:08.635]  Largest engineering firm studied collapse of Twin Towers and so there was no doubt it was controlled explosion.
[00:53:10.055 --> 00:53:14.517]  Well yeah, you also have underwriting laboratories.
[00:53:15.882 --> 00:53:22.206]  You always see UL on buildings, on steel, on air conditioners, on fire extinguishers.
[00:53:22.806 --> 00:53:25.768]  Underwriting Laboratories did their own study and said they blew the thing sky high.
[00:53:26.248 --> 00:53:31.411]  And then they said keep it internal, and one of their engineers went public with the report and they fired him.
[00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:34.954]  They blew all three buildings up right in front of you.
[00:53:35.534 --> 00:53:38.156]  They blew up building 7 with blast points going out.
[00:53:38.376 --> 00:53:45.060]  And I'm supposed to say, no, there's no way the government would do that, because I choose to not believe it, I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:53:46.027 --> 00:53:53.773]  And Paul Watson, we're going to queue up where he did this interview, and I want to get him on muo pronto.
[00:53:54.914 --> 00:54:01.599]  Veteran Middle East correspondent Alan Hart, largest engineering firm, studied collapse of Twin Towers and said there was no doubt it was a controlled explosion.
[00:54:01.879 --> 00:54:03.241]  See, the globalists have a problem.
[00:54:03.281 --> 00:54:06.623]  Everybody starts coming out and saying, look, I'm done playing games.
[00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:09.045]  I'm not going along with your mind control.
[00:54:09.325 --> 00:54:10.907]  Sodium fluoride gives you cancer.
[00:54:11.607 --> 00:54:13.209]  Here's all the government documents.
[00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:13.929]  We're not doing it.
[00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.332]  You're putting cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[00:54:16.372 --> 00:54:18.254]  Here's a thousand mainstream reports admitting it.
[00:54:18.734 --> 00:54:20.916]  You're growing the drugs, shipping it in.
[00:54:20.936 --> 00:54:22.778]  It's just, we're done.
[00:54:22.878 --> 00:54:23.379]  We're done.
[00:54:23.519 --> 00:54:23.979]  We're done.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:24.560]  We're done.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.402]  We got the Goldman Sachs emails.
[00:54:26.422 --> 00:54:27.423]  They engineered the collapse.
[00:54:27.543 --> 00:54:28.083]  We're done!
[00:54:28.384 --> 00:54:28.964]  We're done!
[00:54:29.185 --> 00:54:29.725]  We're done!
[00:54:29.805 --> 00:54:30.106]  Done!
[00:54:30.206 --> 00:54:30.526]  Done!
[00:54:30.766 --> 00:54:32.288]  Do you get it through your stinking head?
[00:54:32.488 --> 00:54:33.088]  We're through!
[00:54:34.343 --> 00:54:35.783]  We're not putting up with it anymore!
[00:54:35.803 --> 00:54:42.605]  We're not putting up with Felipe Calderon, that drug lord, up here shaking his finger at us and telling us to turn our guns into him.
[00:54:42.845 --> 00:54:43.446]  We're done!
[00:54:43.466 --> 00:54:44.466]  You understand?
[00:54:44.686 --> 00:54:45.206]  We're done.
[00:54:45.386 --> 00:54:45.926]  We're through.
[00:54:46.126 --> 00:54:46.686]  We're finished.
[00:54:46.926 --> 00:54:47.607]  We're angry.
[00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:49.467]  We're not under your guilt control anymore.
[00:54:49.667 --> 00:54:50.147]  It's over.
[00:54:50.167 --> 00:54:55.829]  Respected Middle East expert and former BBC presenter Alan Hart.
[00:54:57.796 --> 00:55:06.382]  Has broken his silence on 9-1-1 by revealing that the world's most prominent civil engineering company told him directly that the collapse of the Twin Towers was a controlled demolition.
[00:55:07.162 --> 00:55:09.724]  Speaking on the Kevin Barrett Show.
[00:55:09.804 --> 00:55:10.985]  I know Kevin, he's a good guy.
[00:55:11.005 --> 00:55:12.066]  In fact, cue it up.
[00:55:12.086 --> 00:55:12.946]  I'm going to play this later.
[00:55:12.967 --> 00:55:14.267]  I'm going to have to push Burian back.
[00:55:14.287 --> 00:55:14.888]  This is breaking.
[00:55:16.414 --> 00:55:33.080]  Hart said he thought the 9-1-1 attack probably started as a Muslim operation headed up by some of Bin Laden, but that the plot was subsequently hijacked and carried out by Mossad agents in collusion with elements of the CIA, adding that since its formation, Israel has penetrated every Arab government and terrorist organization.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.681]  So he's going with that Israel did it.
[00:55:35.801 --> 00:55:37.343]  It's all these governments involved together.
[00:55:38.364 --> 00:55:40.585]  Because, I mean, how did Israel make NORAD stand down?
[00:55:40.625 --> 00:55:42.107]  How did Israel have CIA drills?
[00:55:42.647 --> 00:55:46.931]  And again, if you've got five heads on a Hydra, it's all part of the Hydra.
[00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:51.175]  It's not defending Israel, it's not defending England, it's not defending the U.S.
[00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:57.160]  It's just to say it's Israel will then also make it unpalatable in the media and it's going to be spun.
[00:55:58.857 --> 00:56:07.701]  It's like when I talk to the admirals involved here on air and they all said LBJ was involved with the USS Liberty working with Israel to sink it and blame it on Egypt.
[00:56:08.001 --> 00:56:09.522]  That's just what the Admiral said.
[00:56:09.542 --> 00:56:15.184]  It doesn't give Israel any cover being involved in the attack that our government was involved as well.
[00:56:15.584 --> 00:56:16.725]  It shows the collusion.
[00:56:18.669 --> 00:56:26.495]  My guess is that at an early point, they said to the bad guys in the CIA, hey, this operation running what we do, and it goes on from there.
[00:56:26.795 --> 00:56:28.417]  So we'll get him on to talk about this.
[00:56:28.637 --> 00:56:29.657]  ASAP.
[00:56:30.378 --> 00:56:33.540]  Now that is certainly big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:33.801 --> 00:56:36.483]  We're going to come back, talk to Watson briefly, go to your phone calls.
[00:56:37.203 --> 00:56:39.985]  I'm just having to collate all this right now live on Arizona Folds.
[00:56:41.627 --> 00:56:42.527]  We're on the march.
[00:56:43.028 --> 00:56:44.609]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:48.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:51.513 --> 00:56:54.114]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:56:54.534 --> 00:56:59.475]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:56:59.855 --> 00:57:01.576]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:57:01.896 --> 00:57:06.717]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:57:06.897 --> 00:57:07.858]  How much do you want?
[00:57:08.078 --> 00:57:08.838]  When do you want it?
[00:57:09.198 --> 00:57:10.799]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:57:11.079 --> 00:57:11.919]  When will you need it?
[00:57:12.159 --> 00:57:14.220]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.360]  Will there be any food?
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:19.602]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:57:19.762 --> 00:57:22.283]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:57:22.483 --> 00:57:25.665]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:57:26.085 --> 00:57:29.586]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:57:29.887 --> 00:57:30.887]  How much will you need?
[00:57:31.127 --> 00:57:31.727]  We don't know.
[00:57:32.028 --> 00:57:32.948]  How much do you want?
[00:57:33.128 --> 00:57:33.848]  All you can get.
[00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.869]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.462]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:52.482 --> 00:58:54.763]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:54.843 --> 00:58:57.625]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:58.065 --> 00:59:02.828]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:03.168 --> 00:59:07.371]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:10.032]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:10.132 --> 00:59:12.533]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:12.553 --> 00:59:15.474]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:15.815 --> 00:59:23.418]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:59:23.757 --> 00:59:29.042]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:59:29.142 --> 00:59:31.964]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:59:32.004 --> 00:59:35.427]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:59:35.688 --> 00:59:36.588]  And I got news for you.
[00:59:36.769 --> 00:59:38.090]  You're everyone else.
[00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:39.091]  Invisible Empire.

[01:00:10.688 --> 01:00:12.430]  Well, this is huge breaking news.
[01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:15.834]  Paul Watson does such a great job ferreting out all the info.
[01:00:18.479 --> 01:00:25.344]  We've been to Alan Hart's website, and he's got a lot of our material up there, seems very favorable to the work we're doing.
[01:00:26.925 --> 01:00:35.851]  And the real reason I want to talk to him, you can debate what intelligence agency had the lead role, but when you talk about U.S., British, Israeli, it's all merged at the hip.
[01:00:37.852 --> 01:00:45.718]  So I'm not even getting into that area, his speculation on that, and clearly some elements of Israeli intelligence had roles.
[01:00:47.984 --> 01:00:59.487]  The bigger, I mean, it's admitted ABC News, LA Times, that Israeli intelligence was shadowing and living next door to the hijackers, in some cases where they're landlords.
[01:00:59.507 --> 01:01:00.767]  I mean, that's a whole other subject.
[01:01:01.387 --> 01:01:09.469]  I want to get him on record about the construction firm telling him that it was a controlled demolition.
[01:01:09.609 --> 01:01:11.049]  That is the biggin'.
[01:01:11.629 --> 01:01:12.929]  And Watson's done a great job.
[01:01:12.949 --> 01:01:14.810]  I think he should probably add
[01:01:16.078 --> 01:01:24.420]  the latest information uh... with the fox news pundit admitting that that day he was told they were going to blow up building seven
[01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:29.411]  And also all that other information.
[01:01:29.971 --> 01:01:34.713]  But Kevin Barrett is a great guy, so we'll get him on as well about this very, very soon.
[01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:42.317]  I'm going to play a clip of this coming up in a moment, and then David, Roy, Joe, Eric, and others ahead of Walter Burien joining us.
[01:01:42.357 --> 01:01:43.477]  But what an amazing story.
[01:01:43.817 --> 01:01:47.479]  Top construction firm, WTC destroyed by controlled demolition.
[01:01:47.979 --> 01:01:51.181]  And Watson, you might also add, it's a great article, but
[01:01:52.031 --> 01:01:58.275]  The fireman saying it was molten metal, there were bombs going off, the police saying, get back, they're going to blow it up.
[01:01:58.335 --> 01:02:03.799]  And also, what that Dutch engineer, when he's shown Building 7, saying, you know, that's controlled demolition.
[01:02:04.539 --> 01:02:11.284]  Just so people get an idea, this is just basically nuts and cherries on top of the sundae that just pile up and pile up.
[01:02:11.304 --> 01:02:15.767]  But this guy is a prestigious reporter and correspondent for BBC.
[01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:23.513]  You know, coming out and saying that he was told this by one of the biggest controlled demolition firms out there.
[01:02:24.094 --> 01:02:27.997]  This is certainly an incendiary report you've got up at prisonplanet.com.
[01:02:28.037 --> 01:02:31.500]  Top construction firm, WTC, destroyed by controlled demolition.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.341]  Paul Watson.
[01:02:33.762 --> 01:02:43.210]  Yeah, well, the thing to know about this guy is that he's not just a multi-decade Middle Eastern expert who worked for the BBC and ITN.
[01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:53.748]  He was actually on the inside and conducted negotiations between people like Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres.
[01:02:54.505 --> 01:03:09.135]  So, his close friends, I mean, for example, he was close friends with the Shah of Iran and he tried to negotiate with the UK government to have the Shah of Iran go into exile and live in his country estate.
[01:03:09.315 --> 01:03:12.417]  Yeah, this guy has an incredible pedigree, super high-powered.
[01:03:13.258 --> 01:03:17.200]  Quite frankly, he's got the markings of some type of super spy or something.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.284]  Governments don't usually send journalists out with this level of clearance.
[01:03:22.324 --> 01:03:24.185]  But please continue, this is a big deal.
[01:03:25.325 --> 01:03:44.710]  Yeah, so basically beforehand he said he refused to talk about 9-11, didn't want to say anything about it, and then he came out with a quote where he basically said, while the world's collapsing I want to look my grandchildren in the eye and say that I did something.
[01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:51.692]  So now he's gone on the record and said that he had the premier world's
[01:03:52.335 --> 01:04:00.544]  Civil engineering and construction firm analyzed the collapse of the twin towers and presumably building seven as well.
[01:04:01.345 --> 01:04:07.912]  And they told him point blank that it was a controlled ground explosion, a demolition.
[01:04:08.633 --> 01:04:12.417]  He refused to name the exact firm, but he said that
[01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:17.472]  They told him that point blank and he's got no reason to be fabricating it.
[01:04:17.512 --> 01:04:23.757]  He's a successful author, has been for years, and now he's broke his silence on 9-11.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:34.025]  And also, he goes a little bit into speculation about what he thought happened.
[01:04:34.045 --> 01:04:39.629]  He said that the plot was probably started by
[01:04:40.746 --> 01:04:43.307]  Al-Qaeda, however you want to define that.
[01:04:43.787 --> 01:05:01.294]  And because, obviously, Israel, since its formation, has infiltrated and controlled Arab governments and Arab militant groups, that they immediately got wind of the plot, went to the CIA and asked them, you know, what are we going to do about this?
[01:05:02.195 --> 01:05:07.297]  And basically the Zionists and the neocons said, let's use it, which is exactly
[01:05:07.978 --> 01:05:17.580]  What they pronounced in their own Project for a New American Century document the year before they called for a catastrophic and catalyzing event, a new Pearl Harbor.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.660]  And that's exactly what they got with 9-11.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:29.522]  So he points to the fact that there were five dancing Israelis who were originally called Middle Easterners.
[01:05:29.822 --> 01:05:36.643]  It later was confirmed by the Jewish newspaper Forward that they were Mossad agents.
[01:05:37.614 --> 01:05:41.336]  So, of course, that proves that Israel knew the attack was going to happen.
[01:05:42.896 --> 01:06:06.927]  Hart went further and said that he believes that the planes had been fitted with transponders and the attack was conducted by remote control, which is what we lean towards because, of course, top pilots across the board have said that you cannot fly a massive commercial airliner at 600 miles an hour at sea level
[01:06:07.595 --> 01:06:23.999]  A, without the airliner, if it's the standard, you know, Boeing commercial airliner, without it breaking up, because the air pressure at sea level is so intense, and you're going at 600 miles an hour, the flight that went into the South Tower.
[01:06:24.579 --> 01:06:33.621]  And B, these so-called hijackers, alleged hijackers, struggled to even fly basic Cessna-like aircraft.
[01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:36.202]  So the fact that they were able to pull off
[01:06:36.781 --> 01:06:38.082]  Well, for me the big issue is...
[01:06:53.922 --> 01:07:01.145]  Does he say, and I haven't even had a chance to read your entire article because they came in and gave this to me and I was scanning over and we got you on because you're constantly working.
[01:07:01.445 --> 01:07:03.326]  This just went up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:07:03.646 --> 01:07:05.447]  It'll be up on InfoWars.com within minutes.
[01:07:05.467 --> 01:07:08.809]  I mean does he say what, because this is a prestigious reporter.
[01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:10.389]  He's got a very good record.
[01:07:10.429 --> 01:07:11.110]  Does he say what?
[01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:12.830]  What demolition company?
[01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:14.971]  I mean, the biggest is Controlled Demolition Incorporated.
[01:07:14.991 --> 01:07:15.832]  They're one of the biggest.
[01:07:16.252 --> 01:07:18.873]  And they were the ones who helped, you know, drag all the wreckage away.
[01:07:19.213 --> 01:07:22.714]  Not just the World Trade Center wreckage complex, but also Oklahoma City.
[01:07:22.734 --> 01:07:23.915]  So clearly involved in the cover-up.
[01:07:23.955 --> 01:07:25.095]  I would imagine it's not them.
[01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:28.096]  So, I mean, does he say what company?
[01:07:28.116 --> 01:07:38.480]  No, he says he's got close friends and consultants who work for the world's leading civil engineering and construction firm.
[01:07:39.224 --> 01:07:43.926]  He point-blank refused to name it, but he said it was... Well, I mean, that could be General Electric, too.
[01:07:43.946 --> 01:07:47.827]  I mean, when you get up to just overall the biggest building projects, General Electric.
[01:07:49.028 --> 01:07:59.592]  Yeah, he refused to name it, but he said it was the biggest, and that his close friends worked for it, and he commissioned them to look at the videos and the evidence, and they said it was a controlled demolition.
[01:08:00.252 --> 01:08:04.554]  Probably General Electric, because if he says construction, not just demolition, yeah, that would be...
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.546]  Well, there's some other big ones, but I believe... Guys, Google biggest construction company in the world.
[01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:18.677]  I know the Bin Laden Group's like number six or something, but I believe it's General Electric, though they've been divesting some of that.
[01:08:19.257 --> 01:08:21.040]  They build most of the big mega-dams and...
[01:08:22.984 --> 01:08:26.645]  Other things like that, but they also built a lot of the weapons, the smart bombs.
[01:08:27.245 --> 01:08:33.787]  Well, I'll tell you, this is, I mean, we've got the former German defense minister, the former head of German intelligence, the number two currently in the Japanese government.
[01:08:34.628 --> 01:08:39.629]  We've got all these other world leaders coming out, saying it's an inside job.
[01:08:40.909 --> 01:08:45.511]  And, you know, we know the government did Gulf of Tonkin, the government was involved in the USS Liberty.
[01:08:46.811 --> 01:08:48.472]  I mean, I've had all the admirals on.
[01:08:49.112 --> 01:08:50.113]  Geist, all of them.
[01:08:50.153 --> 01:08:51.053]  Most of them are dead.
[01:08:51.834 --> 01:08:53.074]  Moore, I had on a bunch.
[01:08:53.094 --> 01:08:55.516]  The former chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, they all said the same thing.
[01:08:56.296 --> 01:09:02.459]  Israel tried to sink that ship, to blame it on Egypt, to start World War III with the Russians, as basically part of Operation Northwoods in 1967.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:12.424]  And that when they launched their jets to go defend the ship, LBJ got on the radio over the phone and said, that GD ship's going to the bottom.
[01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:16.466]  And that he'd been in control of the ship under a national security operation.
[01:09:17.206 --> 01:09:20.287]  Ignoramuses out there go, presidents aren't over ships.
[01:09:20.628 --> 01:09:22.768]  Yeah, they're over spy ships in national security.
[01:09:23.489 --> 01:09:24.669]  Just like they're over Delta Force.
[01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:28.131]  And it's on record that he was in control of that spy ship.
[01:09:28.491 --> 01:09:34.774]  And it was under McNamara's orders in a specific black op.
[01:09:34.794 --> 01:09:39.996]  Just like Jimmy Carter was over the Delta Force and the 79 failed operation into Iran.
[01:09:42.273 --> 01:09:43.013]  That was a setup.
[01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:44.834]  I've talked to Delta Force people that were involved.
[01:09:45.194 --> 01:09:46.495]  They were set up to fail on that.
[01:09:48.235 --> 01:09:51.757]  It says Vinci is the world's leading commission and construction group.
[01:09:51.777 --> 01:09:53.117]  Of course, everybody says they're the biggest.
[01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:55.658]  I'd have to look at a separate study on that.
[01:09:57.319 --> 01:09:57.659]  Whatever.
[01:09:57.699 --> 01:09:59.380]  Who knows who the biggest construction company is?
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.681]  I want to get him on, and I want to get Barrett on as soon as possible.
[01:10:04.081 --> 01:10:05.382]  We're still going to have Walter Berrion on.
[01:10:05.462 --> 01:10:06.502]  I was going to have him on for two hours.
[01:10:06.522 --> 01:10:10.564]  I'm going to have him on for an hour and forty minutes, but I want to go to your calls as promised, get into some other news.
[01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:25.884]  Watson, can you believe they're now putting up... they tell you on the news by the transponder and you're covered by all the toll roads, on existing roads, but now they're using license plate readers and not even telling you you're on a toll road and then giving you one thousand...
[01:10:27.592 --> 01:10:29.714]  Let me read the Houston TV station article.
[01:10:30.354 --> 01:10:34.937]  $1,575 fines on an original $1.25 toll.
[01:10:35.057 --> 01:10:41.742]  And then now they're announcing all of your roads in England will be paid by the mile, and there'll be no judge, no jury.
[01:10:41.762 --> 01:10:43.323]  They're just going to send you magical bills.
[01:10:43.683 --> 01:10:47.065]  I mean, Paul, they're admitting Bin Laden fake videos.
[01:10:47.085 --> 01:10:48.947]  They're admitting the government grows the opium.
[01:10:50.948 --> 01:10:53.550]  They're coming out in plain view and going, OK, yeah, so what?
[01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:54.771]  We were going to blow up Building 7.
[01:10:55.271 --> 01:10:56.632]  I mean, they're just admitting everything.
[01:10:58.172 --> 01:11:05.875]  Yeah, and with the road toll thing, they're saying that there's going to be massive public resistance, which might stop them from getting it through.
[01:11:06.375 --> 01:11:11.176]  But, as I point out in the article, British people already pay road tax.
[01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:15.317]  They also pay council tax, which goes towards road maintenance.
[01:11:15.878 --> 01:11:20.659]  So they've already taxed twice for the roads, and now they're going to make us pay tolls as well.
[01:11:22.019 --> 01:11:24.260]  And the Rothschilds are the ones pushing it.
[01:11:27.972 --> 01:11:43.621]  So, I mean, yeah, they're going for broke, but on the same token, they're saying that, you know, we're going to go for this, but we're not sure whether we'll be able to ram it all through, because public resistance is growing, and there's going to be a backlash.
[01:11:43.981 --> 01:11:44.922]  But it just remains to be seen.
[01:11:44.942 --> 01:11:46.923]  But if you don't like toll roads, you're racist!
[01:11:48.344 --> 01:11:49.845]  Yeah, that'll be the next thing, I guess.
[01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:54.695]  No, no, they're already attacking Rand Paul, Republican websites, going, he's a delusional fruit.
[01:11:55.035 --> 01:11:56.875]  He believes there's something called SPP.
[01:11:57.235 --> 01:11:59.296]  He believes there was a North American highway.
[01:11:59.636 --> 01:12:00.537]  Public U.S.
[01:12:00.597 --> 01:12:09.100]  government maps, statements, meetings, 83 of the major highways turned into international toll roads to fund the NAU.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.781]  They separately picked Atlanta or Miami as the capital.
[01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:18.303]  It's all public, and they just get up on the news, Paul, and say it doesn't exist, and we're completely insane.
[01:12:19.653 --> 01:12:34.087]  Yeah, now it's come out that the Rachel Maddow interview with Rand Paul, who I was just in an article on this on InfoWars, they put out a fake transcript after the interview with Mia Paul and the racist.
[01:12:34.487 --> 01:12:35.789]  Oh God, there's no end.
[01:12:35.849 --> 01:12:37.310]  He never even said on the show.
[01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:45.086]  I mean, it's overload point here, Watson.
[01:12:45.546 --> 01:12:58.779]  And that's what they're doing psychologically, is they're trying to break our will, where, okay, we make fake bin Laden videos, we grow the drugs, we're poisoning your water, we're putting cancer shots in your vaccines, yeah, the Gardasil's killing kids, we're gonna make you take it.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:05.565]  By the way, going back to the first big story,
[01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:12.294]  General Electric is the biggest overall group, but they subcontract.
[01:13:13.215 --> 01:13:15.717]  And normally it's with Bechtel.
[01:13:16.277 --> 01:13:18.819]  And it says it's the number one construction company in the U.S.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.121]  Vinci is the number one in France.
[01:13:24.464 --> 01:13:26.025]  Horschef in Germany.
[01:13:26.145 --> 01:13:27.706]  CCCLTD.
[01:13:30.369 --> 01:13:31.850]  ACS in Spain.
[01:13:34.454 --> 01:13:36.497]  So he goes, I need to know who the biggest in the world is.
[01:13:36.918 --> 01:13:40.083]  You watch, it's going to be... I've seen that over and over again.
[01:13:40.123 --> 01:13:41.665]  They build almost all the big dams.
[01:13:43.015 --> 01:13:43.475]  Well, who knows?
[01:13:43.515 --> 01:13:45.658]  I shouldn't sit here and obsess over factoids anymore.
[01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:55.847]  But Watson, the reason I figured out I'm even more upset now than I've ever been, and I'm talking to everybody else who's in tune and intelligent and informed, you can feel the quickening, as Ron Paul said.
[01:13:56.267 --> 01:13:58.189]  It's all starting to come to a head.
[01:13:58.209 --> 01:14:04.715]  And you talk about this BBC reporter, top construction firm, WTC destroyed by controlled demolition, you know, you talk about that,
[01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:15.281]  That's why he's saying he went public, according to the quotes you have in the article, is that he sees the whole world going down in flames, why not just tell it all?
[01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:21.244]  And it's that spirit that may save us, if we just stop caring what our neighbor thinks.
[01:14:21.384 --> 01:14:23.265]  Our neighbor only follows who they think.
[01:14:24.145 --> 01:14:24.685]  Is the winner.
[01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:26.626]  Or where they think the wind's blowing.
[01:14:26.987 --> 01:14:28.828]  We've got to stand up as leaders.
[01:14:29.308 --> 01:14:30.889]  And it doesn't mean you have all the answers.
[01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:32.570]  It doesn't mean you're the best spoken person.
[01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:33.731]  Talking about myself.
[01:14:34.111 --> 01:14:37.313]  It doesn't mean you... I love that full metal jacket quote.
[01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:41.995]  You know, Private Joker is silly and ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.
[01:14:42.055 --> 01:14:51.821]  Folks, you just gotta know things are wrong and you gotta stand up and say, folks, wake up, look around you, things are not in good shape right now.
[01:14:52.381 --> 01:15:04.105]  I mean, when they come out and start sending people $1,500 fines without a judge or jury on an unpaid $1.25 ticket, and I know the law, that's illegal.
[01:15:05.025 --> 01:15:09.966]  I mean, the state of Texas last year ruled that the red light cameras are illegal, just like California did.
[01:15:10.266 --> 01:15:12.387]  And the company says, I don't care, we're doing it!
[01:15:12.987 --> 01:15:14.948]  I mean, they're just a pack of scum, Watson!
[01:15:14.968 --> 01:15:18.969]  Well, it's a predatory system, and I mean, they need to
[01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.489]  They won't just let us live our lives.
[01:15:21.949 --> 01:15:29.334]  You know, before people thought, well, if I just keep my nose out of their business and I'm not political, I'll be able to live my life.
[01:15:29.414 --> 01:15:37.098]  But they're not going to allow you to do that because it's a predatory system that depends on feeding upon the public for its own sustenance.
[01:15:40.652 --> 01:15:45.433]  I tell you, Paul, there is now 100% confirmed they are going for broke.
[01:15:45.693 --> 01:15:51.315]  And we say that all the time, but every moment it dawns on me more just how dire our straits are.
[01:15:51.815 --> 01:15:53.556]  And people should be a lot more awake.
[01:15:53.656 --> 01:15:55.476]  Okay, sure, every incumbent's being thrown out.
[01:15:55.736 --> 01:15:56.516]  That isn't enough.
[01:15:56.596 --> 01:15:57.857]  We need bankers indicted.
[01:15:58.197 --> 01:15:59.877]  We need the Federal Reserve gone.
[01:15:59.937 --> 01:16:04.479]  We need... And see, the globalists know, as Ron Paul said, we're gaining ground.
[01:16:04.779 --> 01:16:07.019]  They can look into the future and tell we're going to win.
[01:16:07.359 --> 01:16:09.480]  That's why they're trying to head us off at the pass.
[01:16:11.391 --> 01:16:18.296]  Exactly, and they're planning false flags with which to do that, which is also what Hart talks about.
[01:16:18.356 --> 01:16:31.126]  He says that Israel is basically planning another false flag based around the stolen nukes from Minot Air Force Base, and that it's going to be used as a pretext going to Iran.
[01:16:31.527 --> 01:16:33.528]  And he was on the inside.
[01:16:33.548 --> 01:16:36.410]  That's not an opinion to be taken lightly.
[01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:41.094]  This is somebody who was deeply on the inside in the Middle East.
[01:16:44.997 --> 01:17:04.282]  Well, I mean, the fact that they're so bold to blow up those towers in front of everybody, and then even say they were going to blow up seven, and then blow it up and say, we never said that, when there's scores of radio and TV newscasts as they did it, and they had the BBC false script, they blew it up, and then We Are Change went and interviewed that reporter, the BBC
[01:17:06.636 --> 01:17:10.721]  World News anchor, and he said, oh, I was taking my son to see a movie that day.
[01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:11.903]  I wasn't working on 9-11.
[01:17:12.143 --> 01:17:13.785]  And they said, yes, sir, here's the transcript.
[01:17:13.826 --> 01:17:14.366]  You were on TV.
[01:17:14.406 --> 01:17:16.809]  And he goes, oh, I guess you're right.
[01:17:16.890 --> 01:17:17.470]  I was there.
[01:17:17.731 --> 01:17:19.092]  You can tell that guy's an operative.
[01:17:19.553 --> 01:17:21.736]  And he suddenly says, ah, I guess you're informed.
[01:17:21.756 --> 01:17:23.699]  Hmm, I'll have to speak to you as a human.
[01:17:25.795 --> 01:17:27.016]  It was the same thing with Gary Hart.
[01:17:27.056 --> 01:17:27.676]  Remember Gary Hart?
[01:17:27.696 --> 01:17:31.880]  When they go, we have, you know, you said that our government will stage terror attacks to invade Iran.
[01:17:32.641 --> 01:17:34.522]  You threatened Ahmadinejad in a public letter.
[01:17:34.843 --> 01:17:36.104]  And Hart said, I did no such thing.
[01:17:36.564 --> 01:17:37.665]  And they said, here is the letter.
[01:17:37.705 --> 01:17:39.266]  And they read it and he goes, oh yes I did.
[01:17:39.326 --> 01:17:40.247]  And suddenly he changed.
[01:17:40.467 --> 01:17:41.288]  Started sweating and he went.
[01:17:42.329 --> 01:17:44.451]  He knew he had actual humans on his hands.
[01:17:44.471 --> 01:17:45.552]  He was like, whoa.
[01:17:46.152 --> 01:17:48.014]  Because they're so used to talking to zombies.
[01:17:48.054 --> 01:17:48.434]  Stay there.
[01:17:48.495 --> 01:17:48.815]  Stay there.
[01:17:48.835 --> 01:17:49.375]  Key info.

[01:17:51.636 --> 01:17:52.897]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:17:52.937 --> 01:17:58.300]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:17:58.521 --> 01:18:03.144]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:18:03.544 --> 01:18:08.627]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:18:09.128 --> 01:18:13.811]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:21:32.699 --> 01:21:38.221]  Spread the word about the free internet streams, the podcast, the iPhone free app.
[01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:42.682]  Even if you don't have an iPhone, you can send it to people that have iPhones or iPads.
[01:21:42.762 --> 01:21:44.463]  The link's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:21:45.823 --> 01:21:50.245]  In the listen page, you can buy Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, about taking the states back.
[01:21:51.331 --> 01:21:53.953]  And the Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment, such an important film.
[01:21:54.053 --> 01:21:56.515]  Where were you during the Second American Revolution?
[01:21:57.055 --> 01:21:57.996]  Such an important film.
[01:21:58.076 --> 01:21:59.177]  I'm in it and many others are.
[01:21:59.997 --> 01:22:01.979]  The Secret Team by Fletcher Prouty.
[01:22:01.999 --> 01:22:03.680]  The book the CIA doesn't want you to read.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.162]  From the inside of the Pentagon and the CIA.
[01:22:06.742 --> 01:22:08.203]  One of their top black op commanders.
[01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:11.585]  Back in print for the first time in decades.
[01:22:12.005 --> 01:22:14.706]  An Invisible Empire Noodler Defined by Jason Bermas.
[01:22:15.447 --> 01:22:19.968]  Great new film about the globalists, their master plan, who they are, their admissions of world government.
[01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:22.389]  All available at InfoWars.com.
[01:22:22.409 --> 01:22:30.193]  And when you purchase the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the materials, you get a tool to wake others up and inform yourself to a higher level, but you also support our operation.
[01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:35.615]  And we're in the weird paradox of doubling the listeners every year consecutively for a long time.
[01:22:38.115 --> 01:22:41.340]  And as the economy falls out from under us, revenue going down.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:42.222]  And I've expanded.
[01:22:42.282 --> 01:22:43.644]  We finished the new building.
[01:22:44.205 --> 01:22:46.067]  I'm soon going to do a tour of it and show it to you.
[01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:53.500]  And now I've got a... I ran out of the Money Bomb money, building that and putting everything in.
[01:22:53.521 --> 01:22:54.942]  I need to finish the studio.
[01:22:55.062 --> 01:22:56.383]  I need to fund my operation.
[01:22:56.423 --> 01:22:58.385]  I need to be able to get the personnel in to do it.
[01:22:59.586 --> 01:23:03.729]  So we're going to set up a Money Bomb and do that, but we don't have time to screw around and wait.
[01:23:03.749 --> 01:23:06.151]  If you want to support us, buy the books, buy the videos.
[01:23:06.332 --> 01:23:08.073]  I know times are tough, but just support us.

[01:23:13.057 --> 01:23:18.600]  Our whole mission is just getting the word out here, but also being financially secure to be able to continue through these tough times that are here.
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.801]  So, you can also write to us at P.O.
[01:23:21.841 --> 01:23:24.542]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:23:24.962 --> 01:23:28.304]  And every purchase supports us.
[01:23:28.324 --> 01:23:29.884]  If you want to just give a donation, that's fine.
[01:23:29.924 --> 01:23:30.164]  P.O.
[01:23:30.204 --> 01:23:30.845]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:23:35.632 --> 01:23:42.618]  Organiprisonplanet.tv membership, like I said, or call toll free to get the books and films 888-253-3139.
[01:23:44.799 --> 01:23:49.603]  But we've had a big effect because of you.
[01:23:49.744 --> 01:23:52.326]  And by the way, all the films are free on YouTube and Google and everywhere else.
[01:23:52.346 --> 01:23:54.788]  If you can't afford any of my films, just Google them, they're free.
[01:23:55.568 --> 01:23:57.730]  And please, don't take it for granted then.

[01:24:01.413 --> 01:24:02.414]  Give them to everybody.
[01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:08.573]  Or download them in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, but we need the seed money to operate.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:14.901]  So again, I want to thank all of you for your support, and a great way to be part of the fight is to financially support us.
[01:24:14.941 --> 01:24:17.062]  I mean, who else is at the tip of the spear like us?
[01:24:17.362 --> 01:24:20.063]  Who else is mad dog wild to fight the New World Order?
[01:24:20.343 --> 01:24:24.984]  Who else can't control themselves and is just constantly attacking the enemy?
[01:24:25.284 --> 01:24:26.284]  The Infowars team.
[01:24:26.304 --> 01:24:27.705]  All right, going back to Watson.
[01:24:27.725 --> 01:24:28.865]  We've got about a minute and a half.
[01:24:28.905 --> 01:24:30.326]  Finishing up with this huge story.
[01:24:30.586 --> 01:24:34.147]  Top construction firm, WTC, destroyed by controlled demolition.
[01:24:34.187 --> 01:24:35.467]  Final comments on that, Watson.
[01:24:36.451 --> 01:24:40.553]  Yeah, you were talking about the BBC Building 7 video.
[01:24:41.053 --> 01:24:48.056]  The version of that that I uploaded to YouTube nearly three years ago has over a million views.
[01:24:48.356 --> 01:24:50.076]  About 1.1 million views.
[01:24:50.897 --> 01:24:54.758]  And for about a year they took it down, but now it's back up again.
[01:24:54.838 --> 01:24:59.160]  But they're definitely watching it closely because I got an email from YouTube today.
[01:25:00.091 --> 01:25:02.753]  Saying basically that it violated copyright.
[01:25:02.773 --> 01:25:09.778]  They didn't say they were going to take it down, but... Yeah, what you do is you file a fair use filing on them.
[01:25:09.798 --> 01:25:20.866]  I mean, we have a right to show them saying Building 7 had fallen exactly as it fell, uh, 25 minutes before it fell on two different BBC channels.
[01:25:21.166 --> 01:25:25.249]  We have a right to show CNN with police saying, get back, they're blowing up the building.
[01:25:25.509 --> 01:25:26.950]  They murdered those people.
[01:25:27.230 --> 01:25:28.031]  We have a right.
[01:25:28.111 --> 01:25:28.851]  Stay there, Watson.
[01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:29.472]  Back in one minute.
[01:25:32.768 --> 01:25:36.151]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:26:44.096 --> 01:26:46.017]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:46.477 --> 01:26:49.278]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:55.816 --> 01:26:59.997]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:27:00.657 --> 01:27:01.458]  You want answers?
[01:27:02.238 --> 01:27:03.178]  Well, so does he.
[01:27:03.798 --> 01:27:07.379]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:07.979 --> 01:27:12.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:27:25.931 --> 01:27:27.532]  All right, finishing up with Watson.
[01:27:28.733 --> 01:27:30.814]  They are desperate to stop this information.
[01:27:31.615 --> 01:27:33.656]  Any other points you want to add with the top story?
[01:27:34.277 --> 01:27:37.679]  Top construction firm, WTC, destroyed by controlled demolition.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:39.080]  Then I'm going to take your calls.
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:43.023]  Then coming up, it is confirmed, Rachel Maddow needs to be sued.
[01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:47.566]  Rand Paul, I should have told Ron Paul about this, but I didn't know about it yet.
[01:27:48.507 --> 01:27:50.788]  But I noticed she was misquoting him, things he hadn't said.
[01:27:50.808 --> 01:27:52.109]  And he kept saying, I didn't say that.
[01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:53.911]  And the proof was that he hadn't.
[01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:58.552]  So I've noticed that and noticed that they never ever had a video clip.
[01:27:58.572 --> 01:28:01.073]  They just said he said it and they would have been running it.
[01:28:01.674 --> 01:28:09.560]  And my mother says she goes over to the TV when she's cooking dinner or breakfast and just turns on the TV and no matter what channel it's attacking Rand Paul.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.881]  I mean this is another government hoax.
[01:28:13.002 --> 01:28:15.903]  And, you know, they need to sue MSNBC.
[01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:18.763]  And I'm not into suing people for money or for fun.
[01:28:19.324 --> 01:28:23.325]  But, you know, if somebody gets up on the air and says I'm a drug dealer when I don't even use drugs.
[01:28:23.625 --> 01:28:25.205]  By the way, I don't even drink or smoke anymore.
[01:28:25.225 --> 01:28:28.066]  I'm always going on and off of alcohol and cigarettes, but I've really been doing good.
[01:28:28.086 --> 01:28:30.446]  I went four years once without drinking or smoking.
[01:28:30.466 --> 01:28:31.827]  I'm going to go forever now.
[01:28:31.907 --> 01:28:36.728]  But, you know, the point is, if somebody lies about me and says I'm a drug dealer, I sue them.
[01:28:37.965 --> 01:28:42.626]  Uh, somebody, uh, starts stalking my sister and saying, killer, I sue him!
[01:28:43.846 --> 01:29:03.150]  Uh, I mean, I'm very close to suing the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL, but I mean, everything's going to hell in a handbasket, and they're all so discredited I have it, but Rand Paul needs to go ahead and sue Maddow over this transcript, because that is the definition of slander, and a public figure can win slander, libel, defamation, whatever the case is.
[01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:04.290]  This is, this is, uh,
[01:29:06.325 --> 01:29:10.227]  This is slander and libel because they printed it in overall defamation.
[01:29:10.628 --> 01:29:13.469]  Malice of forethought with the attempt to do harm.
[01:29:13.929 --> 01:29:18.032]  I mean, look, you must sue... This is a message to Rand Paul.
[01:29:18.112 --> 01:29:18.712]  It's confirmed.
[01:29:18.992 --> 01:29:22.575]  You must sue MSNBC for the retraction.
[01:29:23.015 --> 01:29:31.260]  The only thing they'll pay attention to is a big, mean, fat suit against that corporate prostitute system.
[01:29:32.222 --> 01:29:36.824]  Against those bomb-making, baby-killing, General Electric-owned NBC.
[01:29:36.884 --> 01:29:38.605]  And boy, I can prove all of what I just said.
[01:29:39.246 --> 01:29:45.729]  And you need to drag them into court and make it a big deal that you're suing them about their big, fat lies.
[01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:51.632]  Corporate media uses fraudulent MSNBC transcript to portray Rand Paul as a racist.
[01:29:52.032 --> 01:30:00.637]  In order to smear and discredit Rand Paul and prevent him from going to the Senate, MSNBC has modified a transcript that was the appearance of the Racial Madhouse Show, which was then used nationwide.
[01:30:01.277 --> 01:30:04.080]  Paul appeared on the show after he won the primary in Kentucky.
[01:30:04.461 --> 01:30:06.303]  The modified transcript reads as follows.
[01:30:18.254 --> 01:30:24.755]  As before its news notes, Paul's yes was some sort of insignificant vocalization to maintain the flow of conversation.
[01:30:24.775 --> 01:30:27.796]  This was already made difficult by the satellite delay.
[01:30:28.396 --> 01:30:34.117]  Here is a YouTube video of the exchange queued up to the exact moment following the entire video.
[01:30:34.198 --> 01:30:43.500]  So they knowingly then went out and said that he was for not serving black people, when they know that he went, yes, excuse me, say that again, I can't hear you, and then went on to say, no, I'm against discrimination.
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.220]  Paul Watson, comments on this.
[01:30:46.414 --> 01:31:05.187]  Yeah well, I did a segment with Bermas on this last week and this was a contrived smear attack because as soon as Rand Paul won, the media in Unison tried to attack him as a racist elitist because he used a country club at which the stage is victory celebration.
[01:31:05.207 --> 01:31:07.829]  So they were already, you know,
[01:31:08.777 --> 01:31:10.779]  Waiting with bated breath.
[01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:12.600]  But country clubs are everywhere now.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:16.523]  I mean, I mean, they got country clubs you can join, you know, for $20 a visit.
[01:31:16.543 --> 01:31:18.725]  I mean, like it's, ooh, a country club.
[01:31:18.745 --> 01:31:21.267]  Ooh, I mean, what do you think there is in Kentucky?
[01:31:21.688 --> 01:31:23.029]  I mean, I mean, whoop-dee-doo.
[01:31:23.949 --> 01:31:26.011]  Yeah, and that didn't work.
[01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:36.580]  So they immediately went after him on this nuanced philosophical position on civil rights, which, of course, they used to call him a racist and imply that he was a Klan member.
[01:31:37.662 --> 01:31:48.270]  Yeah, well, Matt Al and them are claiming, he said, that he supports shutting down black people's rights to eat at lunch counters when they know he didn't.
[01:31:48.711 --> 01:31:49.551]  God bless you, Paul.
[01:31:49.931 --> 01:31:50.872]  Your call is straight ahead.
[01:31:51.012 --> 01:31:55.756]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:55.936 --> 01:31:56.677]  What have we got?
[01:31:56.917 --> 01:31:59.059]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:59.359 --> 01:32:02.942]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:32:03.002 --> 01:32:04.924]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:32:05.285 --> 01:32:07.186]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:32:07.306 --> 01:32:08.588]  So they think they own our land?
[01:32:08.988 --> 01:32:10.109]  They think they own our water?
[01:32:10.309 --> 01:32:10.710]  Children?
[01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:11.690]  Our education?
[01:32:12.031 --> 01:32:12.671]  Our money?
[01:32:12.851 --> 01:32:16.515]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:32:16.875 --> 01:32:20.519]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:32:21.841 --> 01:32:22.662]  We have the facts.
[01:32:22.862 --> 01:32:23.983]  We have the Constitution.
[01:32:24.044 --> 01:32:24.905]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:32:24.945 --> 01:32:25.766]  We have common law.
[01:32:25.826 --> 01:32:28.088]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:28.349 --> 01:32:32.133]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:32:32.233 --> 01:32:37.017]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:32:37.177 --> 01:32:38.559]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[01:32:38.679 --> 01:32:39.519]  Don't tread on me.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:46.646]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:52.125]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:52.185 --> 01:32:57.527]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:57.767 --> 01:33:02.389]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:33:02.769 --> 01:33:03.189]  It's true.
[01:33:03.249 --> 01:33:07.811]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:13.054]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:33:13.575 --> 01:33:15.496]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:33:15.896 --> 01:33:20.499]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:33:20.699 --> 01:33:21.580]  And here's the best part.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.582]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:33:24.882 --> 01:33:28.184]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:33:28.505 --> 01:33:31.346]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:31.687 --> 01:33:33.588]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:34.829]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:40.253]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:33:41.435 --> 01:33:47.221]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:33:47.542 --> 01:33:49.925]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:53.761]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:33:54.162 --> 01:33:59.128]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:33:59.488 --> 01:34:01.231]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:34:01.551 --> 01:34:06.377]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:34:06.557 --> 01:34:07.499]  How much do you want?
[01:34:07.739 --> 01:34:08.460]  When do you want it?
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.442]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:34:10.722 --> 01:34:11.543]  When will you need it?
[01:34:11.803 --> 01:34:13.866]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:34:14.006 --> 01:34:15.107]  Will there be any food?
[01:34:15.327 --> 01:34:16.669]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:34:16.869 --> 01:34:21.934]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:34:22.134 --> 01:34:25.278]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:34:25.718 --> 01:34:29.221]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:34:29.521 --> 01:34:30.522]  How much will you need?
[01:34:30.762 --> 01:34:31.383]  We don't know.
[01:34:31.663 --> 01:34:32.564]  How much do you want?
[01:34:32.764 --> 01:34:33.504]  All you can get.
[01:34:33.704 --> 01:34:34.545]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:34:34.785 --> 01:34:37.548]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:34:37.848 --> 01:34:39.589]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:34:39.609 --> 01:34:40.530]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:34:51.488 --> 01:34:56.512]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:56.893 --> 01:34:59.215]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:35:01.296 --> 01:35:07.101]  Alright, Rob Jacobson that does film editing here in the office and research.
[01:35:08.462 --> 01:35:18.651]  I'd seen it in the news, but he brought it to me and pointed out that they're having massive suicides at the big plant in China that makes the iPads and iPhones.
[01:35:20.529 --> 01:35:40.442]  And because they're making them work like 16, 17 hours a day, and because they're committing suicide and everything's falling apart and it's total slavery, Apple now makes them sign a contract that they won't commit suicide and if they even, or show any mental illness, so if you argue, you're taken to a mental institution.
[01:35:42.421 --> 01:35:47.827]  So this is psychological tyranny and total slavery, and it's actually got the quotes in the Fox News article.
[01:35:48.087 --> 01:35:56.736]  So I briefly wanted to bring Rob Jacobson up on the phone system to break down his views on it, because he said it so well during that short break.
[01:35:56.756 --> 01:36:00.320]  Then I'm going to cover the economy briefly, then to your phone calls, then Walter Berrien.
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:00.661]  Go ahead.
[01:36:02.044 --> 01:36:08.306]  Hi Alex, I got this article right here, uh, Apple maker Foxconn steps up anti-suicide drive.
[01:36:08.866 --> 01:36:22.130]  The very first line in the article says, Apple manufacturer Foxconn Wednesday urged workers to sign contracts promising not to kill themselves for a stem, uh, to stem a spat of suicides.
[01:36:23.151 --> 01:36:29.993]  Um, later on in the article, near the end of this one article, some guy, uh, who works at the plant actually was quoted as saying,
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.861]  If I bicker with my supervisor, I'll be sent to a mental hospital.
[01:36:35.442 --> 01:36:42.725]  And then the plant themselves follow up by saying, uh, this guy, uh, there is no shortage of people trying to get through the Shenzhen gates.
[01:36:43.265 --> 01:36:47.867]  The company says around 8,000 people apply to work at the factory every day.
[01:36:48.427 --> 01:36:53.329]  So here you have 300,000 people working in this Foxconn factory in China.
[01:36:54.071 --> 01:36:59.893]  Which they admit they have people from all over remote areas of China applying for jobs.
[01:37:00.254 --> 01:37:10.918]  They immediately, the moment they get a job there, they have to waive their rights away, meaning that they know that they are going to be over-houred, underpaid, and all this stuff so that the Chinese regulations don't apply to them.
[01:37:11.398 --> 01:37:19.542]  And now that all these people have been worked to death, they're committing suicide, they're using that as an excuse to have them sign even more kind of draconian
[01:37:21.475 --> 01:37:29.583]  And this is the essence of the New World Order.
[01:37:29.663 --> 01:37:40.673]  Create inhuman conditions, then when you rebel, they clamp in with even more dehumanization, then there'll be more suicides, then everyone will have to be drugged, and remember...
[01:37:41.821 --> 01:37:49.064]  All of the Apple iPad and iPhone knockoffs are costing, on average, half of what the Apple does.
[01:37:49.605 --> 01:37:55.567]  The Apple, I've read, the iPad may have $60 in it, an iPhone may have $20 in it.
[01:37:56.188 --> 01:38:05.752]  Giant, huge profits for Al Gore on their board, for Steve Jobs, but because they say they're liberal and for carbon taxes, the left loves it.
[01:38:06.052 --> 01:38:08.834]  The most abusive factories, the most evil.
[01:38:09.947 --> 01:38:13.770]  And it's just totally, absolutely sickening.
[01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:15.811]  And this is how it works.
[01:38:15.871 --> 01:38:18.733]  And so I've got to come out against the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:38:18.753 --> 01:38:24.116]  You know, even though they're nice products, I mean, this makes Nike look like angels.
[01:38:24.737 --> 01:38:26.538]  And this is a perfect example.
[01:38:27.118 --> 01:38:28.720]  And America will soon be like this.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.381]  We're being destroyed by globalization.
[01:38:31.121 --> 01:38:32.842]  China is the lowest of the low.
[01:38:33.223 --> 01:38:34.603]  They are the great sucking sound.
[01:38:34.924 --> 01:38:39.187]  That's where everything that sucked down the globalist toilet ends up with these poor human beings.
[01:38:39.207 --> 01:38:47.793]  I mean, have you seen the Microsoft photos of everybody asleep, you know, sleeping during their break in their 20-hour workdays inside that facility?
[01:38:48.153 --> 01:38:49.574]  That photo that came out a few weeks ago?
[01:38:50.287 --> 01:38:50.928]  Yeah, I see it.
[01:38:50.948 --> 01:38:57.734]  In fact, there's an article sitting right outside your studio where there are photographs of these people standing there for eight hours a day.
[01:38:58.295 --> 01:39:02.799]  Some of them have to drop things just to give their legs a rest.
[01:39:02.819 --> 01:39:06.143]  Some of them complain about they don't even feel like they're human anymore.
[01:39:06.803 --> 01:39:12.209]  It's obviously this top corporate scheme to get these people to work like robots.
[01:39:12.569 --> 01:39:14.593]  By the way, they work a lot more than eight hours.
[01:39:14.673 --> 01:39:17.197]  China, routinely, they work 18 hours in some cases.
[01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:18.980]  I mean, they have firework factories.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.202]  We're part of public school.
[01:39:21.244 --> 01:39:22.546]  The kids have to work three days a week.
[01:39:25.373 --> 01:39:28.716]  Look at this, Foxcom opens plant to reporters after suicides.
[01:39:29.396 --> 01:39:32.098]  Another Foxcom employee dies in China, media.
[01:39:32.699 --> 01:39:35.521]  Ninth worker death in iPhone factory.
[01:39:36.142 --> 01:39:37.242]  That's in Taiwan.
[01:39:37.262 --> 01:39:40.685]  And it just shows these people, plus it's the chemicals.
[01:39:41.105 --> 01:39:47.731]  I mean, when I drilled that iPad, all that, you were here, you saw that weird poison smoke that came out?
[01:39:49.054 --> 01:39:57.698]  And in fact, I understand that there is an article, I mean, Apple has been caught a lot of times with these weird cancers coming out of their factories years ago.
[01:39:58.339 --> 01:40:06.223]  They know about all these weird chemicals they put in these places, in these machines, these weird, you know, combination of chemicals.
[01:40:06.243 --> 01:40:10.425]  And who knows what's going on in this factory with this combination?
[01:40:10.445 --> 01:40:17.068]  I mean, 300,000 workers, there's got to be a lot of different chemistry going on that these people are inhaling.
[01:40:19.224 --> 01:40:43.633]  If you even complain about it to your supervisor if you're uncomfortable, if you can't stand anymore, well the new thing is going to be that you'll be just dragged away to a mental hospital and according to the factory they don't really care because 8,000 people apply for work there every single day which means it's only a matter of time where the people who don't want to sign the thing will be sifted out and they'll have a full population of people there who have signed this new statement and then
[01:40:44.477 --> 01:40:49.145]  If you're uncomfortable, if you can't stand anymore, if you're inhaling bad chemicals, if you're...
[01:40:50.341 --> 01:40:57.804]  No matter what the issue is, they'll just drag you away and replace you with a new one, truly treating you like... And this is globalization.
[01:40:57.844 --> 01:41:00.965]  They don't want middle classes that have their own truly sustainable communities.
[01:41:01.805 --> 01:41:04.546]  They don't want people that are independent and free and healthy.
[01:41:04.906 --> 01:41:12.649]  They love debasing everything to the lowest level so everyone is bankrupt, so everyone can come to them and get the lowest wage.
[01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:15.069]  Look what Open Borders and NAFTA and GATT have done to Mexico.
[01:41:17.051 --> 01:41:25.000]  According to every research paper out there, Mexico was far worse than they were 17 years ago with the adoption of NAFTA and GATT.
[01:41:25.421 --> 01:41:34.512]  It hurts us, it hurts them, it hurts the Chinese, and this is our destruction and nothing but pure evil coming out of all these widgets.
[01:41:35.373 --> 01:41:53.107]  You know, what we think is cheap, and then buying the cheap goods destroys our industry, and it just gets worse and worse, and then we have more environmental standards, which no one can, you know, put up with, so everything goes to China, where there's no standards, and that's why they've been chosen as the model of the new world government.
[01:41:54.127 --> 01:41:57.028]  Where it's literally a system devouring humanity.
[01:41:57.048 --> 01:42:00.169]  Paul Watson was on with us earlier with a key article.
[01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:03.950]  Top construction firm WTC destroyed by controlled demolition.
[01:42:04.611 --> 01:42:06.391]  We have another big report up.
[01:42:06.451 --> 01:42:12.573]  Corporate media by Kurt Nemo uses fraudulent MSNBC transcript to portray Rand Paul as a racist.
[01:42:13.013 --> 01:42:14.214]  I think this is libelous.
[01:42:14.234 --> 01:42:16.014]  They know it's not what he said and they're going with it.
[01:42:16.474 --> 01:42:17.675]  Slanderous defamation.
[01:42:18.315 --> 01:42:26.106]  And joining us to talk about the situation with the iPhones, iPads in China and Taiwan is Rob Jacobson with the InfoWars team.
[01:42:26.366 --> 01:42:27.467]  Rob, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:42:27.748 --> 01:42:28.308]  No problem, Alex.
[01:42:29.509 --> 01:42:32.512]  Oh man, it is just so much going on, but we're covering a lot of info.
[01:42:32.532 --> 01:42:35.674]  Okay, your call's coming up in a moment, but I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[01:42:36.015 --> 01:42:38.236]  Gold's up over $20 in the last day.
[01:42:38.757 --> 01:42:48.465]  The globalists have tried to drive it down, but the domino implosion of banks and economies worldwide is accelerating, led by the euro situation.
[01:42:48.965 --> 01:42:52.928]  And so I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up to tell you about the gold and silver offers he's got today.
[01:42:54.056 --> 01:42:59.780]  For people out there that want to start moving out of paper to protect themselves with gold at all-time highs worldwide.
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:01.761]  Ted Anderson, good to have you on with us.
[01:43:02.041 --> 01:43:03.422]  Yeah, nice to be up again, Alex.
[01:43:03.482 --> 01:43:07.645]  Of course, we've seen Greece fall apart here in the IMF bailout.
[01:43:07.685 --> 01:43:08.546]  Now it's happening in...
[01:43:09.326 --> 01:43:12.968]  Now it's happening in Spain, and we all know the United Kingdom is having trouble.
[01:43:13.048 --> 01:43:15.630]  I mean, it's just, Europe is just melting apart.
[01:43:15.650 --> 01:43:22.554]  It's melting apart so bad that people are racing to anything that has, anything that has the appearance of security for it.
[01:43:23.075 --> 01:43:23.375]  U.S.
[01:43:23.455 --> 01:43:32.681]  government treasury bills are up, the United States dollar is going up, which is crazy because we're killing it here, and gold is just up like, you know,
[01:43:33.806 --> 01:43:36.469]  Up today to a total of $1,217.80.
[01:43:36.869 --> 01:43:42.393]  So we broke through that $1,200 an ounce price again just real fast.
[01:43:42.453 --> 01:43:50.940]  Really, best thing Alex, what I really want people to do is I want them to take advantage of this frank offer where I have it priced at $256.68.
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:54.282]  It's a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[01:43:54.382 --> 01:43:57.885]  I give a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's newsletter, which is $159.
[01:43:58.285 --> 01:44:02.869]  So you can get informed and you know what's going on in the marketplace.
[01:44:03.089 --> 01:44:08.757]  And Ted, I don't want to attack your competition, but one of the biggest names in the country, associated with Glenn Beck...
[01:44:10.296 --> 01:44:18.419]  Has been attacked lately because they're selling, and I saw the New York Times use the example, of a fifth of an ounce frank at $364.
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:24.562]  You're selling it for $250-something, which is below what it should be.
[01:44:24.582 --> 01:44:26.283]  I mean, it's a good deal to get it for $300.
[01:44:26.543 --> 01:44:29.324]  I'm not even saying it's that bad of a deal, you know, with Beck.
[01:44:29.344 --> 01:44:31.505]  I mean, people expect to have no markup.
[01:44:32.005 --> 01:44:33.966]  You're giving it for $200-something.
[01:44:34.346 --> 01:44:38.488]  In fact, I meant to pull that up, and there is this national investigation
[01:44:39.733 --> 01:44:50.980]  of another big national company for 350, 360 dollar francs and that happened a year ago when gold was a lot lower they were selling it for that.
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:56.083]  Gold's way up and you're selling it for cheaper than anybody else I've ever seen, Ted.
[01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:57.925]  Well, I've got the price low.
[01:44:57.945 --> 01:45:00.788]  I mean, the main thing is that people get a lot of gold in their hands.
[01:45:00.848 --> 01:45:10.440]  I mean, if you're sitting in the stock market, the bond market, if you're looking at, you know, even if you're in T-bills at this point in time, you can just see what the Federal Reserve is doing.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:11.902]  I mean, we bailed out Greece.
[01:45:12.302 --> 01:45:14.605]  We're on the hook for about 16% of that bailout.
[01:45:15.926 --> 01:45:18.068]  And, you know, where's the money coming from?
[01:45:18.108 --> 01:45:18.708]  The U.S.
[01:45:18.768 --> 01:45:20.589]  Treasury doesn't have extra money.
[01:45:20.969 --> 01:45:22.971]  It's coming from the Fed and a printing press.
[01:45:23.091 --> 01:45:25.672]  And we saw what happened last month, or just three weeks ago.
[01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:29.074]  Euro goes down first, then the dollar, within a week.
[01:45:29.415 --> 01:45:31.296]  Because people flee like a seesaw.
[01:45:31.476 --> 01:45:32.337]  You know, the ship's sinking.
[01:45:32.577 --> 01:45:34.480]  So they run to one end of the boat, it starts sinking.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.142]  They run back to the other end of the boat.
[01:45:36.482 --> 01:45:40.967]  The issue is there's a hole in the bottom and no amount of catwalking is going to fix it.
[01:45:41.308 --> 01:45:43.250]  No amount of balancing act is going to fix it.
[01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:47.335]  No amount of gymnastics is going to fix it until we get rid of the bankers, the central bankers.
[01:45:47.615 --> 01:45:49.577]  Ted, quickly, there's a bunch of other coins you've got.
[01:45:49.978 --> 01:45:51.660]  Give folks the toll-free number to call and get them.
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:56.023]  Yeah, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:56.203 --> 01:45:57.324]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:57.424 --> 01:46:03.709]  And Alex, I really want people to take advantage of this frank thing.
[01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:13.637]  I mean, I lose a hundred bucks a coin because I'm giving away the International Forecaster Newsletter with it, but people will be informed and I think they can make much better decisions if they get that.
[01:46:14.738 --> 01:46:15.339]  Absolutely.
[01:46:16.383 --> 01:46:18.184]  Now again, how much is the Frank individually?
[01:46:18.204 --> 01:46:19.884]  Because a lot of people have already got the Forecaster.
[01:46:20.184 --> 01:46:20.784]  That's a great deal.
[01:46:20.805 --> 01:46:23.425]  But if they want to buy them at that price individually, how much did you say?
[01:46:23.786 --> 01:46:24.646]  It's $256.68.
[01:46:25.666 --> 01:46:27.647]  It's just a fabulous buy.
[01:46:27.747 --> 01:46:29.808]  Yeah, because you bought a bunch of it when gold was lower.
[01:46:29.868 --> 01:46:31.708]  You're selling it now when it's higher at a lower price.
[01:46:32.248 --> 01:46:34.749]  And your competition is selling it for $360, according to the news.
[01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.552]  Which isn't even that bad of a deal.
[01:46:38.572 --> 01:46:42.396]  I mean, these companies have overhead, but Ted is the best, folks.
[01:46:42.416 --> 01:46:44.798]  With these specials, you cannot do better.
[01:46:44.839 --> 01:46:46.420]  If you're getting into gold and silver, 800-686-2237.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.361]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[01:46:47.542 --> 01:46:48.743]  This is not a drill.
[01:46:48.783 --> 01:46:50.305]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[01:46:59.077 --> 01:47:06.201]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:10.663]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[01:47:10.703 --> 01:47:20.969]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:22.750]  Under any circumstance.
[01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:29.715]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[01:47:30.055 --> 01:47:30.736]  But listen up.
[01:47:30.756 --> 01:47:36.940]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.801]  Go to HideYourGuns.com.
[01:47:38.841 --> 01:47:40.923]  That's HideYourGuns.com.
[01:47:41.003 --> 01:47:41.483]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:47:41.503 --> 01:47:43.344]  Before they come for your guns.
[01:47:43.384 --> 01:47:43.945]  HideYourGuns.com.
[01:47:44.005 --> 01:47:44.565]  Right now.
[01:47:51.172 --> 01:47:53.213]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:47:53.473 --> 01:47:53.653]  May 26, 2010.
[01:47:53.713 --> 01:47:54.854]  Gold opened this morning at $12.1340.
[01:47:54.894 --> 01:47:58.215]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.4583, $6.2291 for a half-ounce, or $3.1146 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:47:58.255 --> 01:47:59.015]  That's $12.4583, $6.2291, and $3.1146.
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:13.423]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[01:48:13.684 --> 01:48:17.628]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[01:48:17.969 --> 01:48:22.594]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:48:22.855 --> 01:48:28.962]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[01:48:29.262 --> 01:48:29.362]  Yes.
[01:48:55.678 --> 01:48:56.658]  Tyranny is here.
[01:48:56.959 --> 01:49:00.622]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:49:00.642 --> 01:49:03.103]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:49:03.124 --> 01:49:08.568]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:49:08.988 --> 01:49:15.213]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:49:15.633 --> 01:49:21.195]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:49:21.615 --> 01:49:25.276]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:49:25.796 --> 01:49:29.777]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:49:30.077 --> 01:49:32.818]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies...
[01:49:33.311 --> 01:49:35.635]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:49:36.035 --> 01:49:39.060]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:41.002]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:49:41.563 --> 01:49:42.044]  It's here.

[01:49:51.676 --> 01:49:52.357]  The problem.
[01:49:52.437 --> 01:49:54.498]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:49:55.019 --> 01:49:57.160]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:49:57.721 --> 01:49:59.922]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[01:50:00.403 --> 01:50:02.044]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:50:02.905 --> 01:50:11.691]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[01:50:11.892 --> 01:50:14.974]  KaroStove has been in business for over 12 years with the largest

[01:50:41.133 --> 01:50:46.416]  Again, call 888-395-1164 or go to kerostove.com.
[01:50:46.536 --> 01:50:49.658]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[01:50:51.539 --> 01:50:55.561]  We all need no education.
[01:51:10.378 --> 01:51:14.102]  Walter Burian is going to be joining us to talk about a host of issues.
[01:51:16.344 --> 01:51:20.748]  The complete raping of society is now here.
[01:51:20.768 --> 01:51:25.553]  1,500 plus dollar fines with no judge or jury for toll roads.
[01:51:27.301 --> 01:51:32.965]  You know, giant property taxes, VAT taxes, carbon taxes, it's all here by design.
[01:51:34.426 --> 01:51:36.267]  He's the guy that exposed the double set of books.
[01:51:36.307 --> 01:51:40.870]  He's coming up for the balance of the show and interspersed with your phone calls.
[01:51:40.890 --> 01:51:43.833]  But right now, you guys have been really patient, and I apologize.
[01:51:44.673 --> 01:51:47.315]  We had breaking news earlier with the 9-11 info.
[01:51:47.815 --> 01:51:49.236]  Let's talk to David in Ohio.
[01:51:49.256 --> 01:51:50.057]  You're on the air, David.
[01:51:52.118 --> 01:51:55.240]  Oh yeah, I like the story about the iPads, but you bought a few iPads.
[01:51:55.281 --> 01:51:55.841]  Why'd you do that?
[01:51:56.519 --> 01:51:57.779]  Is that kind of support in the New World Order?
[01:51:57.799 --> 01:51:58.620]  Well, absolutely.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:03.021]  I mean, that's the whole point I make is we all contribute to this New World Order system.
[01:52:03.601 --> 01:52:10.624]  And I pointed out in the video I made where I tortured the iPad that people are being used as slaves to build these and most other products.
[01:52:11.664 --> 01:52:15.725]  And then meanwhile, we don't care about the fellow humans, but people will get upset about the iPad.
[01:52:16.305 --> 01:52:20.427]  So I think I flagellate myself, you know, enough here beating myself on air.
[01:52:20.747 --> 01:52:21.467]  But I will say it.
[01:52:21.647 --> 01:52:22.167]  I am bad.
[01:52:22.267 --> 01:52:22.907]  I'm a hypocrite.
[01:52:22.947 --> 01:52:23.548]  I am scum.
[01:52:23.728 --> 01:52:24.288]  How's that, David?
[01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:34.816]  I just wanted to point that out, but I also wanted to point out with Rand Paul, I mean, you guys say he messed with the transcript, but he is for repealing parts of the Civil Rights Bill.
[01:52:35.495 --> 01:52:37.116]  You know, I mean, you're in favor of that.
[01:52:37.156 --> 01:52:38.016]  I don't understand that.
[01:52:38.056 --> 01:52:41.617]  I mean, that'll put us back into a system where black people won't be served in a restaurant.
[01:52:41.657 --> 01:52:42.798]  Oh, yeah, that's really going to happen.
[01:52:43.138 --> 01:52:43.678]  Yeah, I know.
[01:52:43.758 --> 01:52:45.018]  Rand Paul, he's really dangerous.
[01:52:45.038 --> 01:52:46.219]  We all better run for the hills.
[01:52:47.079 --> 01:52:52.181]  They lied about what he said, and he said that he's against people not being able to be in private clubs.
[01:52:53.381 --> 01:52:55.242]  And that's not even one of his campaign issues.
[01:52:56.022 --> 01:52:57.223]  Let me ask you a question, though, David.
[01:52:57.823 --> 01:53:01.224]  David, do you have... what type of telephone are you calling me on right now?
[01:53:02.725 --> 01:53:04.525]  I'm on a cell right now.
[01:53:04.545 --> 01:53:07.686]  Yeah, and the point is, all these companies are doing this.
[01:53:08.286 --> 01:53:20.008]  Apple claims it's all liberal and loving, and so I've always pointed out the hypocrisy of how our own society buying this is destroying us, and I point out how I'm not adequate and I'm not good.
[01:53:20.068 --> 01:53:27.170]  I think it's a disgusting, pathetic argument to call into this show and to imply that I'm some type of bad person.
[01:53:27.450 --> 01:53:29.330]  I mean, am I taking your rights, David?
[01:53:30.768 --> 01:53:33.912]  No, but like an hour ago you said the government's gang raping us.
[01:53:33.972 --> 01:53:36.315]  Now, I mean, you've got to tone down your rhetoric, Alex, for real.
[01:53:36.335 --> 01:53:38.598]  You've been saying it for years that the government wants to gang rape us.
[01:53:38.618 --> 01:53:40.200]  No, the government is gang raping us.
[01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:43.885]  The government is eating out our substance like a Declaration of Independence.
[01:53:44.145 --> 01:53:45.086]  So, David, let me guess.
[01:53:45.146 --> 01:53:46.168]  You've got a government job.
[01:53:47.506 --> 01:53:47.946]  No, I don't.
[01:53:47.966 --> 01:53:52.467]  I just want to ask you, don't you realize that there's a segment of your listening audience that really is deranged?
[01:53:52.907 --> 01:53:56.348]  And when they tell you, when you tell them... Oh, this is a classic talking point.
[01:53:56.869 --> 01:53:58.269]  Classic talking point.
[01:53:58.589 --> 01:53:59.769]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:54:00.029 --> 01:54:03.030]  That I am going to cause deranged people to go out and do things.
[01:54:03.090 --> 01:54:03.270]  No.
[01:54:03.610 --> 01:54:07.211]  No, the government giving nukes to North Korea could cause World War III.
[01:54:07.471 --> 01:54:10.992]  The government giving nukes to Pakistan, on record, could cause World War III.
[01:54:11.393 --> 01:54:15.414]  Israel giving nukes to South Africa could cause World War III.
[01:54:15.454 --> 01:54:16.474]  And they have them, by the way.
[01:54:17.294 --> 01:54:19.936]  And they gave him bioweapons research in exchange.
[01:54:20.136 --> 01:54:21.016]  That's now on record.
[01:54:21.617 --> 01:54:28.220]  The government raping and robbing and stealing our wealth and our money is what's causing people to be deranged.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:34.563]  And you're calling in implying Rand Paul is really basically an evil person that wants to black people to be back out on the back 40.
[01:54:35.144 --> 01:54:37.365]  And you're calling in saying I'm evil
[01:54:37.645 --> 01:54:48.014]  Because I talk about how I have an iPhone, and how this thing is used to enslave us and control us, and I show people this, and I illustrate how all cell phones track us in real time to control us.
[01:54:48.294 --> 01:54:51.577]  And I use it as an illustration, and you call in with nothing!
[01:54:51.797 --> 01:55:02.547]  You're not going to do anything about the bank sucking us dry, anything about the comprehensive annual financial reports, nothing about the fluoride in the water, nothing about the cancer viruses in the vaccines, nothing!
[01:55:03.067 --> 01:55:03.508]  Nothing!
[01:55:04.048 --> 01:55:04.789]  Nothing, David!
[01:55:04.869 --> 01:55:05.969]  What's your story, David?
[01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:07.310]  Who do you like politically?
[01:55:07.330 --> 01:55:08.791]  You like Barack Obama, David?
[01:55:09.411 --> 01:55:11.912]  That's been... double-blind studies have proven that's not an issue.
[01:55:11.932 --> 01:55:14.154]  What I'm more worried about... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[01:55:14.214 --> 01:55:16.295]  Double-blind studies have shown what is not an issue?
[01:55:16.315 --> 01:55:19.016]  Fluoride is safe, Alex.
[01:55:20.357 --> 01:55:22.538]  Sodium fluoride is good for you?
[01:55:23.099 --> 01:55:24.679]  I'll go on the air right now and say that.
[01:55:24.719 --> 01:55:29.002]  What I'm more concerned about is some of your listeners... Oh, you're scared of the American people.
[01:55:29.901 --> 01:55:32.382]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, Rand Paul!
[01:55:33.142 --> 01:55:38.925]  Sir, the bags of fluoride that they put in the water have skull and crossbones on it and it says deadly poison.
[01:55:39.505 --> 01:55:43.267]  I've had top EPA scientists on of how it's accumulated poison.
[01:55:43.487 --> 01:55:45.448]  The Nazis did use it in death camps.
[01:55:45.688 --> 01:55:48.369]  Pulitzer Prize winning authors wrote the I.G.
[01:55:48.429 --> 01:55:51.931]  Farben crime and punishment who were part of the Nuremberg trial.
[01:55:52.771 --> 01:55:55.012]  And you just call in and say double blind studies.
[01:55:55.352 --> 01:55:55.913]  Baloney!
[01:55:56.829 --> 01:55:57.369]  Baloney!
[01:55:58.069 --> 01:56:00.810]  All the stu... You are... Cite your study right now.
[01:56:02.711 --> 01:56:03.811]  You're not answering my major point, Alex.
[01:56:03.871 --> 01:56:05.111]  Cite your study!
[01:56:06.372 --> 01:56:06.832]  You know what?
[01:56:06.932 --> 01:56:08.632]  I dare you then, punk.
[01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:09.192]  Shut up!
[01:56:09.693 --> 01:56:13.013]  I dare you to eat an entire bottle of fluoride toothpaste.
[01:56:13.654 --> 01:56:16.594]  I dare you to eat that and videotape it live on the internet.
[01:56:16.995 --> 01:56:17.935]  You know what'll happen to you?
[01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:22.359]  You will go to the hospital, buddy, and you'll have fluoride poisoning.
[01:56:22.759 --> 01:56:26.019]  It says on the back of the toothpaste, it's deadly poison, not to swallow it.
[01:56:26.779 --> 01:56:28.460]  Answer the question, you scum!
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.600]  Hey, don't worry, you're gonna get what you want, you government bureaucrat.
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:38.281]  You're gonna get what you want, you're gonna get your big government, you're gonna get your fluoride, go take all your vaccines, just give it all to your kids.
[01:56:38.701 --> 01:56:39.902]  Just, you make me sick!
[01:56:40.362 --> 01:56:41.242]  You make me sick!
[01:56:41.622 --> 01:56:42.562]  We're on the march.
[01:56:43.022 --> 01:56:44.642]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:45.562 --> 01:56:48.243]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:51.018 --> 01:56:52.278]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:56:52.318 --> 01:56:57.680]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:02.542]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:57:02.922 --> 01:57:03.322]  It's true.
[01:57:03.402 --> 01:57:07.964]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:57:08.504 --> 01:57:13.207]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:57:13.728 --> 01:57:15.649]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:57:16.029 --> 01:57:20.652]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:57:20.832 --> 01:57:21.733]  And here's the best part.
[01:57:21.953 --> 01:57:24.735]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:57:25.035 --> 01:57:28.337]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:57:28.658 --> 01:57:31.499]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.741]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:57:34.061 --> 01:57:34.982]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:57:38.624 --> 01:57:40.406]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:57:41.586 --> 01:57:47.371]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:57:47.691 --> 01:57:50.073]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:57:52.557 --> 01:57:56.178]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:56.518 --> 01:58:04.640]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:09.421]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:58:10.001 --> 01:58:20.823]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:58:21.443 --> 01:58:30.471]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:58:30.972 --> 01:58:36.036]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[01:58:50.512 --> 01:58:54.453]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:54.693 --> 01:59:00.734]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:01.094 --> 01:59:08.195]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:08.475 --> 01:59:13.056]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:59:13.356 --> 01:59:15.477]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:59:22.061 --> 01:59:24.323]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:24.343 --> 01:59:24.684]  Call us!

[01:59:44.347 --> 01:59:44.828]  Thank you!
[01:59:55.447 --> 02:00:07.457]  Ladies and gentlemen, four years ago, the American Dental Association said that children under the age of six should not brush their teeth with sodium fluoride because it causes weakening of the teeth, dental fluorosis.
[02:00:08.698 --> 02:00:10.580]  There are scores of major U.S.
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:18.226]  government studies that many types of bone cancer more than double, and even more than double, if it's in males.
[02:00:18.266 --> 02:00:19.247]  It's even worse in males.
[02:00:20.518 --> 02:00:21.559]  Anyone can Google this.
[02:00:21.799 --> 02:00:23.079]  Anyone can search engine this.
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:28.602]  We have thousands of studies that mercury causes brain damage, but it doesn't matter.
[02:00:28.642 --> 02:00:35.626]  The feds put out two studies a few years ago saying mercury is good for your children's brain.
[02:00:35.646 --> 02:00:41.289]  This was put out on national CBS TV and re-aired as part of a news feed on local affiliates.
[02:00:41.690 --> 02:00:46.032]  Here is CBS News in Austin saying mercury is good for your child's brain.
[02:00:46.432 --> 02:00:49.394]  And you can tell Dave was not breastfed as a small brain and
[02:00:50.074 --> 02:00:51.535]  Probably has had plenty of vaccines.
[02:00:51.836 --> 02:00:58.341]  He's so scared of the American people who want to keep black people out of lunch counters, which was never said, but he's scared to death.
[02:00:58.361 --> 02:01:01.664]  He's not worried about Goldman Sachs, or the global meltdown, or Kim Jong-il.
[02:01:02.005 --> 02:01:03.246]  He's worried about Rand Paul, folks.
[02:01:03.266 --> 02:01:04.467]  He's hiding under his bed right now.
[02:01:04.807 --> 02:01:05.187]  So, hey!
[02:01:05.888 --> 02:01:06.909]  Don't believe me, David.
[02:01:06.989 --> 02:01:07.810]  I'm a fear monger.
[02:01:08.050 --> 02:01:08.550]  You're right.
[02:01:08.771 --> 02:01:13.595]  The news says Mercury is... ...containing vaccines mayhem on kids.
[02:01:13.815 --> 02:01:16.798]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[02:01:17.438 --> 02:01:19.480]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:22.221]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:25.444]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[02:01:28.286 --> 02:01:34.250]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:41.134]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:01:41.154 --> 02:01:48.539]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:01:50.538 --> 02:01:51.840]  Okay, so you know what?
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.303]  Maybe you do have a study saying fluoride's good.
[02:01:54.383 --> 02:02:01.873]  Maybe you've got a study saying that if you take a 357 Magnum and shoot yourself between the eyes with it, that it's going to increase your IQ.
[02:02:03.308 --> 02:02:07.629]  But, or maybe you think if you jump off the Grand Canyon without a parachute it's going to improve your IQ.
[02:02:07.649 --> 02:02:10.770]  Or maybe you think playing in traffic is going to improve your IQ.
[02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:14.691]  Maybe you think drinking buckets of cyanide is going to improve your IQ.
[02:02:15.071 --> 02:02:22.753]  Maybe you think cutting your veins with a, you know, taking a meat cleaver and just hacking at your arm is going to help your, you know, your pedicure.
[02:02:22.773 --> 02:02:24.093]  I mean, you know, whatever punk!
[02:02:25.553 --> 02:02:28.894]  Don't call in here with your Rachel Maddow talking points on me!
[02:02:29.594 --> 02:02:31.815]  I could care less if you listen to what you think of me.
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:36.762]  If somebody calls in disagreeing with real issues and really asks questions, oh, I'll spend hours with them.
[02:02:37.082 --> 02:02:43.444]  But somebody calls in with talking points, lying about Rand Paul, and trying to basically distort what I stand for.
[02:02:44.324 --> 02:02:56.349]  By the way, saying that parts of the Civil Rights Act have been misapplied, like making men's fraternal orders take women, and making women's fraternal orders take
[02:02:57.975 --> 02:02:59.816]  Men, I mean, have you heard all the cases?
[02:02:59.836 --> 02:03:01.057]  In fact, let's just Google one.
[02:03:02.177 --> 02:03:07.560]  You know, transvestite, transgender sues over no access to women's bathrooms.
[02:03:09.481 --> 02:03:18.725]  And, you know, a lot of these guys in these cases are whacked out, they're in there with their privates in front of women, and women walk in, there's a man in there, and the women say, I don't want you in the bathroom.
[02:03:18.905 --> 02:03:19.485]  Well, you know what?
[02:03:19.505 --> 02:03:19.986]  They sue!
[02:03:21.107 --> 02:03:22.508]  You know, give me a break, okay?
[02:03:22.548 --> 02:03:23.388]  It's out of control.
[02:03:24.009 --> 02:03:24.829]  It's out of control.
[02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.870]  There you go.
[02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:28.151]  Transgender sues Macy for discrimination.
[02:03:29.612 --> 02:03:33.835]  I can't go into the changing room.
[02:03:33.975 --> 02:03:34.776]  That was one of the cases.
[02:03:34.816 --> 02:03:35.816]  I don't know what this case is.
[02:03:35.836 --> 02:03:38.218]  Let me read it.
[02:03:38.278 --> 02:03:45.422]  A Filipino-American is suing her former employer Macy's department store for wrongful termination and discrimination for close to three years.
[02:03:46.783 --> 02:03:49.145]  Was an employee at Macy's store, and it goes on.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:57.852]  And it goes on, worked in the cosmetics department, was fired September last year for allegedly insubordination.
[02:03:57.892 --> 02:03:59.234]  But see, that's not it.
[02:03:59.475 --> 02:04:00.316]  There's cases.
[02:04:01.311 --> 02:04:06.134]  There's cases where they want to be in the dressing rooms, but look... Whatever, man!
[02:04:06.154 --> 02:04:07.154]  You want to dress up like a woman?
[02:04:07.334 --> 02:04:07.654]  Great!
[02:04:07.734 --> 02:04:08.215]  Good for you!
[02:04:08.235 --> 02:04:18.680]  You know, I'm thinking about star systems and galactic vortex and, you know, genetic engineering and off-world bases, and I'm thinking about, you know, the human species.
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:20.761]  I'm not thinking about your mascara.
[02:04:21.302 --> 02:04:21.682]  Okay?
[02:04:21.702 --> 02:04:24.203]  I'm like, ooh, this will show mommy I'm putting mascara on.
[02:04:24.583 --> 02:04:25.164]  Whatever!
[02:04:25.484 --> 02:04:27.345]  Dress up like Ronald McDonald if you want!
[02:04:27.685 --> 02:04:29.065]  Don't come after my private property.
[02:04:29.265 --> 02:04:30.286]  Don't come after my guns.
[02:04:30.306 --> 02:04:31.306]  Don't come after my kids.
[02:04:31.606 --> 02:04:32.546]  Leave me alone.
[02:04:32.646 --> 02:04:37.047]  I'm not owned by you, you scumbag corporate government, looting everyone.
[02:04:37.107 --> 02:04:38.567]  I'm going to Walter Berian here in a moment.
[02:04:38.987 --> 02:04:41.008]  I'm going to take your calls throughout the interview with you.
[02:04:41.108 --> 02:04:43.928]  I'm just really wound up today, as you can notice.
[02:04:47.349 --> 02:04:52.710]  But first, I want to tell you about a few sponsors, and we're going to Walter Berian for the balance of the broadcast with some key info.
[02:04:54.670 --> 02:04:56.751]  I want to tell you about Front Sight, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:57.779 --> 02:04:59.140]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:03.563]  He has a free handgun and five days of world-class firearms training for you!
[02:05:04.083 --> 02:05:10.367]  You can attend five days of world-class training at Frontside Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit!
[02:05:11.067 --> 02:05:12.168]  All for pennies on the dollar!
[02:05:12.528 --> 02:05:18.352]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice!
[02:05:18.852 --> 02:05:24.855]  I believe now is the time for you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:05:25.175 --> 02:05:28.616]  Front Sight provides such training without any camera drill instructor attitude.
[02:05:29.097 --> 02:05:32.198]  FrontSight.com, FrontSight.com, FrontSight.com!
[02:05:32.798 --> 02:05:33.279]  I love them!
[02:05:34.739 --> 02:05:36.380]  You're not going to get my guns, David!
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:36.980]  Sorry!
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.662]  They're still red-blooded people and you parasites don't like it!
[02:05:41.842 --> 02:05:45.784]  You think you're going to have us lay down and you can suck our blood and you don't like us getting too upset!
[02:05:46.004 --> 02:05:47.325]  Well, we are upset, David!
[02:05:48.945 --> 02:05:50.626]  And you should be concerned, David!
[02:05:53.367 --> 02:05:55.628]  Because we're not bending over anymore, boy!
[02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:58.569]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is Ecola Blue.
[02:05:58.589 --> 02:06:03.551]  Did you know you could be drinking clean, fresh water made right out of the air you breathe?
[02:06:03.851 --> 02:06:05.811]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[02:06:06.312 --> 02:06:09.493]  Our sponsor, Ecola Blue, the Ecola Blue 28 and the brand new Ecola Blue 30.
[02:06:10.293 --> 02:06:11.954]  Machines will allow you to do just that.
[02:06:12.814 --> 02:06:17.238]  It's easy to use, and it will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day!
[02:06:17.758 --> 02:06:22.882]  The water, once generated, passes through a seven- or, in the bigger unit, twelve-stage filtering process.
[02:06:23.603 --> 02:06:25.384]  It's the best, cleanest water you can get at coloblue.com.
[02:06:25.404 --> 02:06:26.045]  E-C-O-L-O, blue dot com, or 800-691-6043.
[02:06:26.065 --> 02:06:26.125]  800-691-6043.
[02:06:26.165 --> 02:06:29.268]  Folks, I am literally being animated by the spirit of liberty right now, and I'm just sick of it.
[02:06:41.383 --> 02:06:43.424]  I'm sick of the tyranny and that's why they're afraid.
[02:06:43.444 --> 02:06:55.810]  They're so afraid they want to set the parameters of debate and tell you to sit out and shut up and drink your poison water and take your shots and eat your GMO food and let the little control freaks who are actually vicious devils run our lives.
[02:06:56.150 --> 02:06:57.130]  It's not happening!
[02:06:57.411 --> 02:06:58.511]  It's over scum!
[02:06:58.751 --> 02:06:59.111]  Got it?
[02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:00.512]  It's over scum!
[02:07:00.712 --> 02:07:03.573]  The veneer of civilization is burning off our hull.
[02:07:03.794 --> 02:07:06.155]  It's peeling away and showing what we really are.
[02:07:06.335 --> 02:07:10.997]  The dynamic, genius creatures that will not be dominated by anybody!
[02:07:11.257 --> 02:07:12.478]  Do you understand that?
[02:07:13.259 --> 02:07:14.380]  I know you don't like it!
[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:15.701]  Because you're cowards!
[02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:26.071]  The truth is scum and weak filth always joins together to pull down the real men, to pull down the real humans, to pull down the people that know the destiny of this species!
[02:07:28.533 --> 02:07:31.076]  Alright.
[02:07:32.337 --> 02:07:32.597]  Alright.
[02:07:32.837 --> 02:07:33.538]  Now I'm gonna shut up.
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:36.261]  I'm gonna stop now.
[02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:43.841]  Walter Berrien is an advocate of government financial accountability and budgeting.
[02:07:45.541 --> 02:07:46.381]  He was enlisted in the U.S.
[02:07:46.421 --> 02:08:01.645]  military, goes through that, forwarded to nuclear power school, he put in an early discharge in the Navy, United States Naval Academy, worked at Xerox Corp, Princeton, and he was a big trader
[02:08:02.899 --> 02:08:02.939]  on
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.801]  It's all been vetted out now.
[02:08:23.881 --> 02:08:25.041]  Now it's a mainstream term.
[02:08:25.061 --> 02:08:26.282]  People know about the double set of books.
[02:08:26.582 --> 02:08:28.083]  It's like they now know about the Federal Reserve.
[02:08:28.103 --> 02:08:31.245]  They don't know as much about this as they do about the Fed, but it all ties together.
[02:08:31.265 --> 02:08:39.250]  So you got the floor to describe what the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports are, what the double set of books are, what the private-corporate takeover through government is.
[02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:43.292]  And it's good to have you back with us, Walter Burian.
[02:08:44.462 --> 02:08:45.983]  Good to be back, Alex.
[02:08:46.043 --> 02:08:50.086]  I just had one comment for Dave, your previous caller.
[02:08:50.646 --> 02:08:50.926]  Yes.
[02:08:51.326 --> 02:08:55.889]  And that one comment is, predators do not like armed prey.
[02:08:55.909 --> 02:09:00.832]  About over ten years ago, I did a little statistical survey.
[02:09:00.852 --> 02:09:07.596]  I was a commodity trading advisor, and I put together graphs and charts and so forth, and I looked at each state.
[02:09:08.519 --> 02:09:15.948]  For the highest and strongest taxation and money taking from the populace, state by state.
[02:09:15.968 --> 02:09:22.456]  And I did a comparison with the least restringent gun ownership laws.
[02:09:23.271 --> 02:09:34.915]  Well, when you compare the charts side by side, the states that are taking or stealing the most amount of money from the population has the most stringent gun control laws.
[02:09:35.415 --> 02:09:42.377]  The states that are taking the least amount of money from the population have the least restrictive gun laws.
[02:09:43.251 --> 02:09:44.892]  Yeah, I go back to what I said before.
[02:09:45.252 --> 02:09:52.094]  Predators do not like armed... Oh, look at Daley, that big, fat, admitted mob boss, wanting everyone's guns, period.
[02:09:52.274 --> 02:09:56.055]  They're a bunch of predatory scum, and, oh, they make me sick!
[02:09:56.295 --> 02:10:05.638]  We're supposed to not like people that want us to be their slaves, as you know, Walter, and you've been through hell, through government persecution, with them taking your son, everything else, but you're supposed to love it.
[02:10:05.838 --> 02:10:07.219]  You're supposed to thank the government.
[02:10:07.339 --> 02:10:11.020]  You're supposed to worship them and appreciate all the evil they give you.
[02:10:13.361 --> 02:10:21.445]  Now when you say government also, keep in mind people have this false illusion they say government and it's a draw blank.
[02:10:21.505 --> 02:10:27.889]  Government is made up of individuals with names, addresses, that are running the show.
[02:10:28.369 --> 02:10:35.493]  Now at the top of our echelon, the congressmen, the senators, the governors, 70% now are attorneys.
[02:10:36.033 --> 02:10:37.854]  Everyone knows the reputation of an attorney.
[02:10:38.582 --> 02:10:40.203]  Oh, you got to use me or else you'll be destroyed.
[02:10:40.223 --> 02:10:43.246]  And then once you use them, we're going to take as much money as we think we can get from you.
[02:10:43.746 --> 02:10:47.669]  And then once they screw you, they say that they act all indignant, and if you don't say thank you.
[02:10:48.690 --> 02:11:01.479]  And we now have 70% attorneys running the entire show, walking with as much cash as they can take now, and dotting the i's and crossing the t's to lock in the productivity value of the next five to seven generations.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:03.281]  Now let's get a clue.
[02:11:03.561 --> 02:11:04.481]  Is there a problem here?
[02:11:04.622 --> 02:11:04.982]  Yes.
[02:11:06.483 --> 02:11:07.824]  And it needs to be corrected.
[02:11:08.254 --> 02:11:14.157]  Well, in every case in history, elite groups get together and try to get control of the population and then make them slaves.
[02:11:14.537 --> 02:11:15.558]  That's 101.
[02:11:16.138 --> 02:11:20.881]  But you said during the break you wanted to talk briefly about the new 9-11 info that's come out.
[02:11:20.961 --> 02:11:27.204]  Then let's get into... Well, in my bio, if you looked, I was lieutenant at One World Trade Center back in 1978 to 1980.
[02:11:30.587 --> 02:11:36.908]  And the key point, I see a lot of people are missing, goes way back to when they were planning on building the towers.
[02:11:37.228 --> 02:11:44.590]  They had lawsuits filed against them from the surrounding buildings, saying that you're not going to build this gigantic tower if it fell over to take out 20 or 30 buildings.
[02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:50.751]  So they had to come up with a design that was guaranteed not to cause that problem.
[02:11:51.231 --> 02:11:59.853]  So the original design, which was approved and the lawsuits were dropped, was to build a center core steel column in the center, which would act
[02:12:00.614 --> 02:12:04.861]  As a guidepost for all the suspended floors.
[02:12:05.242 --> 02:12:07.446]  The floors would be suspended on that.
[02:12:08.351 --> 02:12:18.693]  Center steel core column, and in any event that for whatever reason the tower was collapsing, it would pancake it down around the center steel core.
[02:12:19.293 --> 02:12:23.094]  So picture that center steel core as a broomstick, and the floor is supported on it.
[02:12:23.114 --> 02:12:27.515]  If they started to collapse, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, down on the guide post.
[02:12:27.935 --> 02:12:31.196]  There is no ifs, ands, or buts, period.
[02:12:31.932 --> 02:12:39.056]  That if the floor started collapsing around the guidepost, the guidepost was to be left standing.
[02:12:39.096 --> 02:12:44.378]  So you would have the entire tower collapse and this massive center steel core column in the center.
[02:12:44.398 --> 02:12:49.481]  But instead they were blasted off at perfect intervals and ejected out 600 feet.
[02:12:50.381 --> 02:12:57.364]  Well, let's say for argument's sake, the plane generated 20,000 degrees of heat in the middle of the steel core columns on that floor.
[02:12:58.165 --> 02:13:00.246]  Then you'd have the entire upper floor toppled.
[02:13:00.916 --> 02:13:03.438]  And the rest of the steel core column is staying in place.
[02:13:04.578 --> 02:13:06.740]  So there is no ifs, ands, or buts, period.
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:07.721]  End of story.
[02:13:08.001 --> 02:13:14.865]  That tower was demolished for the center steel core to drop with the floors that were pancaking down.
[02:13:14.885 --> 02:13:16.726]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[02:13:16.927 --> 02:13:17.407]  End of story.
[02:13:18.448 --> 02:13:19.348]  Absolutely, Walter.
[02:13:19.368 --> 02:13:29.695]  The original design of the World Trade Center towers and that point, you'll find out that that steel core was designed to be left standing as the guidepost for the collapsing floors.
[02:13:30.194 --> 02:13:31.074]  All right, Walter.
[02:13:31.695 --> 02:13:34.856]  Now, I want to get into the main reason you're here, and I appreciate you coming on.
[02:13:34.896 --> 02:13:36.217]  We'll give people your website.
[02:13:36.257 --> 02:13:50.082]  You have a new film out for people available on the website, and you've got a director's cut coming out soon that I hope you put on DVD so we can offer it because, of course, I produce a little documentary with you in it called Comprehensive Annual Financial Report Exposed on InfoWars.com.
[02:13:50.102 --> 02:13:52.583]  It's on DVD, but that was made 12 years ago.
[02:13:52.603 --> 02:13:54.944]  So much more has happened since then in your new update.
[02:13:55.265 --> 02:13:57.405]  Everything you talked about 12 years ago has now come true.
[02:13:58.866 --> 02:14:10.031]  Again, let's go back to your awakening, what you discovered, you got involved in the news media, you found out about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, and now what's happened?
[02:14:10.051 --> 02:14:16.654]  Because, again, you expose this, you expose the fact that this is an organized mafia criminal operation.
[02:14:17.134 --> 02:14:18.395]  Every city manager knows.
[02:14:19.335 --> 02:14:25.337]  I've had city managers in my studio on other issues and I bring this up and they get this big giant smile and turn red.
[02:14:28.097 --> 02:14:31.798]  And they won't say a word and they just start laughing even though it's been quote patriots.
[02:14:31.818 --> 02:14:38.120]  One of them was a good guy who's fighting the NAFTA highways and I brought this up and he just laughed and turned red during the break and said I'm not getting into that.
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:41.281]  So this is the big delicious secret.
[02:14:41.641 --> 02:14:42.461]  So let's break it down.
[02:14:43.311 --> 02:14:47.734]  Well, the beautiful part is, it's actually not a secret, it's there in plain sight.
[02:14:48.235 --> 02:14:51.237]  The whole game was the silence of the golden routine.
[02:14:51.257 --> 02:14:57.522]  Never talk about it, never mention it, no one would look, no one would think about it, no cognitive thought created.
[02:14:58.283 --> 02:15:00.064]  But I found out about this back in 1990.
[02:15:00.304 --> 02:15:04.686]  There was a governor who got elected by the name of Jim Florio in New Jersey on a new tax platform.
[02:15:04.706 --> 02:15:07.347]  As soon as he gets in, $2.8 billion tax increase.
[02:15:07.367 --> 02:15:10.448]  It was drafted by the prior administration, but he could have vetoed it.
[02:15:10.468 --> 02:15:17.431]  There were two DJs that were operating out of 101.5 FM in Trenton, John and Kent.
[02:15:17.931 --> 02:15:20.632]  We're now out in Los Angeles at the John and Kent Show.
[02:15:21.312 --> 02:15:24.894]  Well, they started doing ramble rousing, saying, no, we can't do this to us.
[02:15:24.914 --> 02:15:27.035]  We've got to stop it and repeal this tax increase.
[02:15:28.106 --> 02:15:35.897]  And I called into the show, just reading from the budget report at the time, a 1990s budget report from New Jersey.
[02:15:36.338 --> 02:15:40.123]  They had $11 billion on budget, $6 billion off budget, service budget of $17 billion.
[02:15:40.144 --> 02:15:42.868]  They had available about $25.3 billion.
[02:15:43.848 --> 02:15:48.211]  And, you know, John and Ken goes, well, we have to stop this, we have so much money!
[02:15:48.591 --> 02:15:52.393]  And ten of us got together and incorporated a group called Hands Across New Jersey.
[02:15:52.413 --> 02:16:00.557]  I took over looking at the budget revenue and finance, being a monetary trading advisor and dealing with numbers, you know, $1 or $10 billion.
[02:16:00.577 --> 02:16:01.798]  It's just a number.
[02:16:01.818 --> 02:16:03.079]  We're the population.
[02:16:03.119 --> 02:16:04.659]  Oh my God, $10 billion, I can't even think there.
[02:16:04.679 --> 02:16:05.280]  My mind goes blank.
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:08.303]  Yeah, it's just the number.
[02:16:08.864 --> 02:16:14.329]  So I started looking at the budget report and I noticed all the income from the autonomous agencies were not there.
[02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:17.773]  The interest, massive investment accounts I knew the state had were not there.
[02:16:17.793 --> 02:16:20.156]  I said, this is not the whole picture.
[02:16:21.272 --> 02:16:24.235]  The Director of the Budget, Richard Keeley, was on vacation that week.
[02:16:24.355 --> 02:16:26.178]  He didn't come back until the following Tuesday.
[02:16:26.218 --> 02:16:27.359]  I called his lower assistant.
[02:16:27.459 --> 02:16:28.701]  Hi, this is Walter Burien.
[02:16:28.741 --> 02:16:30.123]  I'm working on a report for Richard.
[02:16:30.143 --> 02:16:31.945]  I have to get it done by Tuesday.
[02:16:32.005 --> 02:16:35.669]  I need all the figures on the Autonomous Agency accounts, interest accounts, investment accounts.
[02:16:36.090 --> 02:16:39.254]  He goes, oh, you want a comprehensive annual financial report.
[02:16:40.003 --> 02:16:40.183]  Yeah.
[02:16:58.321 --> 02:17:02.362]  And I started looking for the gross income, total cash gross receipts.
[02:17:02.382 --> 02:17:07.903]  So number one question, IRS asks, and I found it on page 174 under cash additions.
[02:17:08.503 --> 02:17:21.326]  This shows the cumulative income for tax income, investment income, enterprise income, federal grants, whatever income the state had, just state government income, don't keep in mind.
[02:17:22.359 --> 02:17:27.664]  And, uh, the figure was approximately, uh, $83 billion.
[02:17:29.265 --> 02:17:34.530]  Now, that figure, uh, when I saw it, I said, this is the definition of organized crime.
[02:17:34.550 --> 02:17:41.416]  Here they are promoting a $17 billion operating budget, and in the overall picture, they're bringing in $83 billion.
[02:17:43.137 --> 02:17:45.799]  And, you know, I started digging, and I found... I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:17:45.819 --> 02:17:47.000]  You're digging, you're digging.
[02:17:47.021 --> 02:17:48.322]  And then the rest is history.
[02:17:48.882 --> 02:17:49.302]  Stay with us.

[02:17:59.778 --> 02:18:04.239]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[02:18:04.519 --> 02:18:06.440]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:07.900]  Made me feel breathless.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:12.341]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[02:18:12.741 --> 02:18:13.761]  Nothing did anything.

[02:18:51.277 --> 02:18:56.139]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:18:56.239 --> 02:18:57.019]  What have we got?
[02:18:57.219 --> 02:18:59.360]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:00.420]  A republic.
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:03.261]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:19:03.321 --> 02:19:05.241]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:19:05.601 --> 02:19:07.502]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:19:07.622 --> 02:19:08.902]  So they think they own our land?
[02:19:09.303 --> 02:19:10.423]  They think they own our water?
[02:19:10.623 --> 02:19:11.023]  Children?
[02:19:11.223 --> 02:19:12.023]  Our education?
[02:19:12.344 --> 02:19:12.984]  Our money?
[02:19:13.184 --> 02:19:16.825]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:19:17.185 --> 02:19:20.847]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:19:20.887 --> 02:19:21.867]  You are being warned!
[02:19:22.168 --> 02:19:22.988]  We have the facts.

[02:19:54.476 --> 02:19:56.699]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:19:57.019 --> 02:19:58.841]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?

[02:20:09.553 --> 02:20:12.857]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:20:13.337 --> 02:20:14.677]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:20:15.038 --> 02:20:17.638]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[02:20:17.878 --> 02:20:20.839]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.

[02:20:56.062 --> 02:20:57.343]  You're supposed to get mad.
[02:20:57.743 --> 02:20:58.784]  You're supposed to get angry.
[02:20:58.804 --> 02:21:04.589]  Walter Burien is the first person to talk about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[02:21:04.609 --> 02:21:09.774]  I mean, now they've had the former auditor of the Air Force come out and say it's a great idea.
[02:21:10.154 --> 02:21:18.801]  They've had governors come out and talk about, hey, let's use all this investment surplus to fund everything, similar to what goes on in Alaska.
[02:21:19.702 --> 02:21:28.050]  So, it's really gained ground, and I've been to a lot of political events, I've seen C-SPAN calls, I've seen the governor of Texas questioned about it.
[02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:31.973]  These giant slush funds of money that is off budget.
[02:21:32.454 --> 02:21:41.261]  So you only hear about the budget, oh there's no money in the budget for potholes, there's no money in the budget for schools, there's no money in the budget for state teacher pensions or police pensions.
[02:21:42.122 --> 02:21:52.149]  Meanwhile, they have all these separate investments, and universities have got them, school districts, water districts, tens of thousands of government institutions, more than tens of thousands, and Walter's got all those numbers.
[02:21:52.189 --> 02:22:10.301]  So, Walter, you're investigating, you're looking at this, you're fighting tax increases in New Jersey on the talk radio, and then you get a copy of the big kahuna, the Hidden in Plain View Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[02:22:10.341 --> 02:22:10.661]  Go ahead.
[02:22:11.945 --> 02:22:21.288]  Now, I got a copy of that report, and I called the two DJs, John and Ken, from 101.5, and I said, John, I got the Holy Grail of accounting in my hands, the state's comprehensive annual financial report.
[02:22:21.829 --> 02:22:22.709]  Let's go live on there.
[02:22:22.729 --> 02:22:24.650]  He goes, well, come on down to the studio, and we'll see.
[02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:27.611]  Went down to the studio, showed him the report, and he goes, yep, this is it.
[02:22:27.671 --> 02:22:29.151]  And I showed him the bottom line numbers.
[02:22:29.211 --> 02:22:30.012]  He goes, ooh.
[02:22:30.732 --> 02:22:35.654]  So for the next hour, we sat there reading out the bottom line numbers with me giving out analogies.
[02:22:36.234 --> 02:22:39.635]  That was the last live radio interview that that station did.
[02:22:40.402 --> 02:22:42.683]  They were doing live interviews every single day, two or three a day.
[02:22:43.423 --> 02:23:03.489]  But when I came up with the Comprehensive Annual Finance Report and started qualifying the scope and degree of the money that was being held by the state and went live on the air and had one 1.5 out of about five to seven million listeners daily, they got calls from their sponsors, pharmaceutical companies, large construction groups, other different companies.
[02:23:03.970 --> 02:23:08.131]  If you ever let that guy on the air again, you're going to lose all of our sponsorship.
[02:23:09.904 --> 02:23:12.985]  Now, that ended any live interview.
[02:23:13.365 --> 02:23:20.048]  The reason they called was, you know, they were quite aware of how much money was involved and how much money was flowing through governments, cities, counties, states.
[02:23:20.848 --> 02:23:23.849]  And a lot of them had, you know, there was a lot of grease on the skids.
[02:23:23.989 --> 02:23:29.531]  And they were getting millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions of dollars, that the public didn't even know existed in the first place.
[02:23:30.251 --> 02:23:32.552]  Because government was investing the tax money with them.
[02:23:36.391 --> 02:23:39.133]  And spending the tax, no, it's not just tax money.
[02:23:39.153 --> 02:23:46.257]  When you look at a comprehensive annual financial report, about one third of the gross income is tax income.
[02:23:46.317 --> 02:23:51.140]  The other portion is broken up primarily, the primary income now is investment income.
[02:23:51.500 --> 02:23:51.780]  Yes.
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:56.743]  Then tax income comes second, and the third is enterprise group income.
[02:23:57.558 --> 02:24:06.362]  So, when you see a budget report, these budget reports are selectively created to show where tax income is brought in and tax income is spent.
[02:24:06.842 --> 02:24:11.624]  So you go over a budget report with a fine-tooth comb and it looks like government's surviving on tax income.
[02:24:12.245 --> 02:24:15.366]  When you look at the annual finance report, you see a whole different world.
[02:24:15.986 --> 02:24:23.770]  You know, you can have a state saying, oh, we're $700 million short on our budgetary basis, we're gonna have to raise taxes, lay off a few teachers, and da-da-da-da-da-da.
[02:24:24.330 --> 02:24:25.931]  And you look at the same exact
[02:24:26.978 --> 02:24:31.721]  Uh, local government's annual finance report, there could be two and a half billion dollars in the black!
[02:24:32.882 --> 02:24:35.003]  You know, it's the definition of a shell game.
[02:24:35.924 --> 02:24:52.274]  And the, uh, Silas's Golden Rule, where, you know, no mention of a comprehensive annual finance report for 65 years, keep in mind it started back in 1946, required the full cooperation of the syndicated media, controlled education, and both political parties.
[02:24:52.714 --> 02:25:02.479]  They were included in on the game for the last 45 years, sent copies of all the reports, and they know it was sacrilegious to make open and conspicuous mention of these reports.
[02:25:02.959 --> 02:25:11.623]  Now a lot were cooperating with the game, not laughing all the way down to the bank as they spent the money or had the money invested in their new projects, real estate ventures and everything else.
[02:25:12.424 --> 02:25:20.671]  And the ones that thought it was wrong, they knew that if they'd mentioned it, they'd find themselves out in the back alley getting their earlobe kicked and... Alright, stay there, Wolter.
[02:25:20.831 --> 02:25:21.692]  Back in one minute.

[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:45.961]  Tyranny is here.

[02:25:50.144 --> 02:25:52.426]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:25:52.446 --> 02:25:57.910]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:25:58.310 --> 02:26:04.555]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:26:04.975 --> 02:26:10.517]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:26:10.938 --> 02:26:14.639]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:26:15.139 --> 02:26:19.141]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:26:25.363 --> 02:26:28.365]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:26:28.925 --> 02:26:30.325]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:26:30.886 --> 02:26:31.326]  It's here.

[02:26:43.973 --> 02:26:45.914]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:26:46.354 --> 02:26:49.176]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:11.798 --> 02:27:14.120]  Walter Burian is our guest.
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:16.723]  He just joined us like XM does in the last hour.
[02:27:17.624 --> 02:27:21.427]  Walter Burian worked as a commodities advisor.
[02:27:22.449 --> 02:27:37.365]  He worked on the stock market, and he found out in 1990, when he was battling tax increases in New Jersey on syndicated radio and local radio, that there was something called a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, a double set of books that were the profits of government investment.
[02:27:37.805 --> 02:27:41.769]  This isn't tax money, it isn't pensions, it isn't what you're told about in the budget.
[02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:43.751]  It's the real set of books.
[02:27:44.352 --> 02:27:49.594]  So Walter, recap that and give people the history of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[02:27:49.614 --> 02:27:53.035]  This started in Chicago with the 1313 Mafia model.
[02:27:53.455 --> 02:27:56.656]  And then explain how it spread out and why this is so important.
[02:27:56.956 --> 02:28:06.520]  This shell game where they're cutting off teachers, shutting down state parks, national parks, firing over half the police in some areas, not fixing sidewalks.
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:12.342]  But meanwhile, the government is just rolling in deep, deep wells of money.
[02:28:12.622 --> 02:28:12.962]  Go ahead.
[02:28:13.769 --> 02:28:14.790]  Okay, just one correction.
[02:28:15.130 --> 02:28:17.971]  I was a commodity trading advisor and never traded stocks.
[02:28:18.171 --> 02:28:19.312]  I follow the stock market.
[02:28:19.552 --> 02:28:21.593]  A commodity trading advisor on the thing.
[02:28:21.613 --> 02:28:21.954]  Go ahead.
[02:28:23.995 --> 02:28:25.636]  Just one key point here.
[02:28:25.676 --> 02:28:30.298]  When I started National Disclosure, I started National Disclosure in June of 98.
[02:28:31.919 --> 02:28:36.862]  And I got a call from school teachers from around the country, college professors.
[02:28:37.589 --> 02:28:41.512]  And I would mention to him, your school district puts out a comprehensive annual finance report.
[02:28:41.572 --> 02:28:51.260]  I said, do you see going to your 8th grade class saying, hi class, here's our school's budget report, and here's our school district's comprehensive annual finance report.
[02:28:51.601 --> 02:28:53.742]  Let's see if we can spot the differences.
[02:28:54.303 --> 02:28:56.925]  They find their walking papers so damn fast, they wouldn't know what hit them.
[02:28:57.771 --> 02:29:08.662]  You know, the colleges, especially these colleges that are saying, oh, we have a shortfall of our budgetary basis and we have to raise tuitions by 15, 20 percent, cut back the teachers' salaries.
[02:29:09.163 --> 02:29:14.929]  If you look at these schools' endowment funds, okay, I looked at ASU in 1990, they had $11 billion in their endowment fund.
[02:29:17.438 --> 02:29:17.898]  Okay.
[02:29:18.539 --> 02:29:23.902]  Here, at the same time, they were saying, oh, we have a shortfall of our budgetary basis, we're going to have to raise tuitions by 8%.
[02:29:24.163 --> 02:29:29.886]  Their endowment funds generated more in return than all tuitions collected combined!
[02:29:29.906 --> 02:29:33.889]  Yeah, that's why they're into football teams and the school, because it's not even real.
[02:29:34.209 --> 02:29:34.950]  It's just a front.
[02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:39.193]  It's like UT, last time I checked, over $60 billion in one slush fund.
[02:29:40.173 --> 02:29:46.738]  They finance sports teams, Clear Channel Radio, and again, it's water districts, school districts, they've all
[02:29:47.538 --> 02:29:52.582]  Just, they take our tax money, they invest it, and then now the investment's bigger than the taxes.
[02:29:52.903 --> 02:29:54.644]  They rule everything, and that's not enough.
[02:29:54.704 --> 02:29:55.825]  Now they want all the roads.
[02:29:56.125 --> 02:29:57.666]  Now they want license plate readers.
[02:29:57.967 --> 02:30:00.208]  Now they want, I mean, just the total raping.
[02:30:00.288 --> 02:30:03.311]  It all boils down to the money involved.
[02:30:03.351 --> 02:30:06.153]  Everything is done due to the money involved.
[02:30:06.213 --> 02:30:07.394]  Nothing more, nothing less.
[02:30:07.854 --> 02:30:15.741]  Smokescreens are put up left and right to keep the public looking off the left field, as these guys are cutting $100 billion deals on the other side of the field.
[02:30:16.261 --> 02:30:20.083]  The public being entertained in la-la land, never thinking of the basics.
[02:30:20.743 --> 02:30:23.364]  Now I've had thousands of phone calls from people all over the country.
[02:30:24.044 --> 02:30:29.587]  All my school districts raising our taxes, the county's raising, the state's raising our taxes, this, that, everything.
[02:30:29.907 --> 02:30:33.929]  And I'll stop them for a second and I'll say, OK, I have a couple of questions for you.
[02:30:33.949 --> 02:30:34.789]  And they'll say, OK, what?
[02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:37.690]  I'll say, uh, do you know how much cash you have in your pocket?
[02:30:38.090 --> 02:30:39.271]  They say, yeah, why do you ask?
[02:30:39.851 --> 02:30:42.252]  I say, well, do you know where you're checking your account balance is approximately?
[02:30:42.612 --> 02:30:43.093]  Yeah.
[02:30:43.653 --> 02:30:43.833]  Why?
[02:30:44.608 --> 02:30:45.749]  Well, two more questions.
[02:30:45.789 --> 02:30:48.551]  Do you know what your value of your investments are?
[02:30:49.831 --> 02:30:50.252]  Yeah.
[02:30:50.692 --> 02:30:51.552]  And what about your net worth?
[02:30:51.572 --> 02:30:52.973]  Do you have a good idea what your net worth is?
[02:30:53.874 --> 02:30:54.194]  Yeah.
[02:30:54.674 --> 02:30:57.996]  And I'll say, well, you just called me about your city raising your taxes by $40 million.
[02:30:58.897 --> 02:31:00.058]  What's their checking account balance?
[02:31:00.538 --> 02:31:01.219]  Uh, don't know.
[02:31:01.239 --> 02:31:02.659]  Take a guess.
[02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:03.860]  Uh, can't.
[02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:04.561]  Don't have a clue.
[02:31:05.501 --> 02:31:07.262]  What about their investments?
[02:31:07.342 --> 02:31:09.144]  How much do they have in investments total there?
[02:31:09.484 --> 02:31:09.944]  No idea.
[02:31:10.084 --> 02:31:10.624]  Take a guess.
[02:31:11.445 --> 02:31:11.785]  I can't.
[02:31:11.885 --> 02:31:12.145]  Why?
[02:31:12.245 --> 02:31:12.846]  Don't have a clue.
[02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:14.433]  What about their net worth?
[02:31:17.102 --> 02:31:17.523]  No idea.
[02:31:17.544 --> 02:31:18.727]  Say yes.
[02:31:19.450 --> 02:31:20.072]  Don't have a clue.
[02:31:20.092 --> 02:31:20.473]  Can't do it.
[02:31:21.244 --> 02:31:22.205]  They refuse to even guess.
[02:31:22.765 --> 02:31:36.617]  So here, the basic fundamentals, that is with every one of your listeners, since they're little kids up until when they die, you know, I don't care if you're five years old and opened up your first lemonade stand and you made $5.80, you count it ten times, you know exactly you have $5.80.
[02:31:36.937 --> 02:31:40.400]  In college, you decide to start trading the markets.
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:41.981]  Well, my account's $31.01.
[02:31:42.281 --> 02:31:47.385]  Well, we don't know, but we don't even look at what the government's really got.
[02:31:47.425 --> 02:31:48.946]  We just believe the budget they show us.
[02:31:48.987 --> 02:31:49.367]  Stay there.
[02:31:49.427 --> 02:31:50.408]  Long segment coming up.
[02:31:51.257 --> 02:31:56.661]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:31:57.922 --> 02:32:02.666]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:03.067 --> 02:32:09.852]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[02:33:51.069 --> 02:33:53.670]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:59.032]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:33:59.412 --> 02:34:01.132]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:34:01.453 --> 02:34:06.274]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:34:06.454 --> 02:34:07.415]  How much do you want?
[02:34:07.635 --> 02:34:08.355]  When do you want it?
[02:34:08.755 --> 02:34:10.357]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:34:10.637 --> 02:34:11.458]  When will you need it?
[02:34:11.718 --> 02:34:13.780]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:15.021]  Will there be any food?
[02:34:15.262 --> 02:34:16.583]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:34:16.783 --> 02:34:21.848]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:34:22.049 --> 02:34:25.192]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:34:25.632 --> 02:34:29.133]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:34:29.453 --> 02:34:30.434]  How much will you need?
[02:34:30.674 --> 02:34:31.294]  We don't know.
[02:34:31.574 --> 02:34:32.494]  How much do you want?
[02:34:32.674 --> 02:34:33.395]  All you can get.
[02:34:33.615 --> 02:34:34.475]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:34:34.715 --> 02:34:37.456]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:34:37.756 --> 02:34:39.517]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:34:39.537 --> 02:34:40.457]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:34:52.327 --> 02:34:57.969]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:35:02.970 --> 02:35:14.374]  Okay, if you just joined us, or you're a long-time listener, you've seen the film I made 12 years ago, Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports Exposed,
[02:35:15.407 --> 02:35:17.748]  Or you've seen the other presentations Walter's done since then.
[02:35:18.408 --> 02:35:19.489]  This is a fact.
[02:35:19.729 --> 02:35:21.430]  And it's now entered the political debate.
[02:35:21.950 --> 02:35:22.650]  Thanks to Walter.
[02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:24.731]  I mean, he is the progenitor of this.
[02:35:25.652 --> 02:35:26.752]  Hidden in plain view.
[02:35:27.433 --> 02:35:34.036]  Just like I have the Washington Post from two days ago just reporting, oh, the CIA did make those fake Bin Laden videos.
[02:35:35.151 --> 02:35:39.416]  Oh, they didn't make him for domestic political brainwashing to scare you into wars.
[02:35:39.756 --> 02:35:42.059]  They made it to discredit him in the Muslim world.
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:45.303]  They just admit it like it's no big deal because we've exposed it.
[02:35:45.823 --> 02:35:48.526]  They come out and admit, yeah, we're growing the opium in Afghanistan.
[02:35:48.927 --> 02:35:52.130]  And I know I keep hammering this point because it's so incredible.
[02:35:53.018 --> 02:35:55.340]  Well, it's the same thing with the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[02:35:55.860 --> 02:35:57.382]  I brought this up to politicians.
[02:35:58.042 --> 02:35:59.404]  I brought this up to Rick Perry.
[02:35:59.484 --> 02:36:00.805]  I brought this up to city managers.
[02:36:01.285 --> 02:36:10.233]  And folks, when you bring this up to them, and I've seen it done in a lot of meetings now in town halls, they'll be just ignoring everybody and they don't care if you grump about taxes being too high, they're ready for that.
[02:36:10.633 --> 02:36:15.397]  When you bring up, hey, you've got a double set of books, you've got two, three, four, five times, sometimes more,
[02:36:16.318 --> 02:36:18.240]  Investments that are off the books.
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:20.763]  These aren't... Because people have built-in rationales.
[02:36:20.783 --> 02:36:24.247]  You know, you tell teachers or cops this, especially, and they'll go.
[02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:27.272]  Well, that's for my pension fund, those government investments.
[02:36:27.633 --> 02:36:28.674]  No!
[02:36:29.214 --> 02:36:30.355]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:36:30.596 --> 02:36:35.360]  They're now going to cut your pension funds on budget to pay back banks money that's not owed.
[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:36.201]  Because here's the scam.
[02:36:36.261 --> 02:36:38.283]  I used to ask Walter this the last 12 years.
[02:36:39.464 --> 02:36:43.668]  Is it the government taking over corporations or is it the global corporations taking over government?
[02:36:43.728 --> 02:36:45.269]  He said, well, basically it's a merger.
[02:36:45.770 --> 02:36:47.532]  But if you look at this now, and I agree with him,
[02:36:48.666 --> 02:36:54.212]  The big global offshore banks are now setting up their G20 world government, saying a world government run by banks.
[02:36:54.773 --> 02:37:04.263]  They've kind of double-crossed government by selling derivatives as the investments to the pension funds, public pension funds, cities, counties, water districts, universities.
[02:37:04.603 --> 02:37:07.026]  You've seen Harvard, you know, losing half its endowment or whatever.
[02:37:08.087 --> 02:37:10.229]  To actually get them under their control.
[02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:13.951]  So it appears to be a coup, not just a merger.
[02:37:38.707 --> 02:37:42.948]  So it turned out it wasn't a, oh my gosh, derivatives are a crisis.
[02:37:43.188 --> 02:37:46.309]  They were just threatening everyone through financial terror to do it.
[02:37:46.769 --> 02:38:05.633]  Now again, for those who just joined us, recap, a commodity trading advisor on record in 1990 in New Jersey, fighting tax increases for the next six, seven years, did research, did global discovery, global disclosure of the fact, and I didn't believe Walter when I interviewed him in 97.
[02:38:07.173 --> 02:38:08.293]  I didn't think he was a liar either.
[02:38:08.433 --> 02:38:15.454]  I went down to the state of Texas, got the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, and it said that they had half a trillion dollars in just liquid investment profit that year.
[02:38:15.474 --> 02:38:20.055]  I went and checked UT with its $40 billion then, now it's $60 plus billion.
[02:38:20.535 --> 02:38:23.576]  I went and checked Travis County with its billion bucks.
[02:38:23.896 --> 02:38:27.016]  I went and checked Manhattan, just like he said, it was over a trillion.
[02:38:27.416 --> 02:38:29.997]  I went and checked the state of New York, it was almost a trillion.
[02:38:30.357 --> 02:38:32.937]  I went and checked all these places, and guess what?
[02:38:33.197 --> 02:38:34.618]  They were online!
[02:38:35.018 --> 02:38:36.258]  They weren't even hiding this.
[02:38:36.778 --> 02:38:41.440]  Walter, I'm going to completely shut up and give you the absolute floor now for the next few segments.
[02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:46.102]  Put it in layman's terms how important this is, because you were trying to finish your point when we hit the break.
[02:38:46.402 --> 02:38:55.786]  When the politicians get up there and say, we've got to get rid of the National Park, the State Park, we've got to close your favorite park, they could just not mow the grass, but they want you to know it's closed.
[02:38:55.826 --> 02:38:56.907]  The fence is going up.
[02:38:57.247 --> 02:39:00.488]  You can't have potholes fixed.
[02:39:00.589 --> 02:39:02.769]  California's announcing we're not going to fix roads.
[02:39:03.150 --> 02:39:05.291]  We're going to lay off half the cops in this town.
[02:39:06.411 --> 02:39:11.294]  That's a psychological play on the population.
[02:39:12.074 --> 02:39:17.117]  As I mentioned, everything that is done, period, I don't care what it is, is done due to the money involved.
[02:39:17.217 --> 02:39:30.744]  And government has turned into a corporate, for-profit enterprise, utilizing the population as a productivity unit to be drained of value and their productivity.
[02:39:31.791 --> 02:39:44.256]  And going back to the last break, I mentioned that, you know, when someone called me, I'd always stop them and ask them if they knew how much cash they had in their pocket, what their checking account balance is, what their investment worth was, and their net worth.
[02:39:44.296 --> 02:39:45.757]  And everyone knew, without exception.
[02:39:46.637 --> 02:39:52.880]  One person that called, when they called me about their city, county, state, school district, complaining about tax increases.
[02:39:53.559 --> 02:40:00.163]  Had a clue of what the, uh, that entity's, uh, you know, cash on hand, uh, investment totals or net worth was.
[02:40:00.644 --> 02:40:12.172]  An entire vacuum and void was created, intentionally so, in the comprehension of an entire population of the basics, which each and every one of us knows in our own personal lives since we're little kids.
[02:40:12.592 --> 02:40:14.693]  Up until when we die, we keep it in the back of our minds.
[02:40:15.053 --> 02:40:17.115]  And here, government is operating
[02:40:17.839 --> 02:40:25.622]  Yeah, having created this entire vacuum and void in every single venue for people not to even think about it, not to have a cognitive thought.
[02:40:26.482 --> 02:40:35.365]  Yeah, so it is absolutely amazing they pulled that one off to be able to void out the basics that we carry with us each and every day.
[02:40:35.385 --> 02:40:37.946]  Now on the derivative aspect,
[02:40:40.209 --> 02:40:47.472]  In 2008, keep in mind government on all levels, state, city, county, and so forth, were actively involved with the derivatives.
[02:40:48.632 --> 02:40:52.413]  And Pennsylvania has a pretty good capital report to look at for the state.
[02:40:52.613 --> 02:40:55.054]  On note D, they list their derivative activity.
[02:40:56.175 --> 02:41:02.217]  And since I mentioned that, they started expanding their sections, making it harder to see.
[02:41:02.237 --> 02:41:03.477]  But if you look at an older report,
[02:41:04.606 --> 02:41:09.270]  Pennsylvania, as a state, was dealing in more derivatives than Merrill Lynch as a company.
[02:41:09.971 --> 02:41:11.652]  It did.
[02:41:11.672 --> 02:41:23.882]  And the derivative play, going back to 2000, Alan Greenspan, as quoted from the Wall Street Journal, said he was concerned about the $80 trillion a year derivative market internationally.
[02:41:24.762 --> 02:41:26.384]  Now, between 2000 and 2008, they had expanded
[02:41:29.645 --> 02:41:33.307]  The international derivative market up to $600 trillion.
[02:41:33.727 --> 02:41:34.868]  They were building this balloon.
[02:41:35.568 --> 02:41:36.349]  Big, big balloon.
[02:41:36.789 --> 02:41:38.810]  But on derivatives, very important.
[02:41:38.830 --> 02:41:43.853]  95% of the public doesn't comprehend this because it's never been discussed.
[02:41:44.294 --> 02:41:56.040]  On a derivative, all you're doing is buying time, six months, five months, a year, two years out, on a specific commodity or stock options and so forth, locking in a price at this time.
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:57.041]  So if the price changes,
[02:41:57.870 --> 02:42:00.692]  You can cancel out your trade and collect the equity difference.
[02:42:00.712 --> 02:42:09.776]  So if you think, say, gold is at $1,000 and you think it's going to drop down to $500, you could sell a gold contract six months to five months later, drops down to $500.
[02:42:10.877 --> 02:42:15.719]  You buy back a gold contract, that cancels out the trade, but you just collected $500.
[02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:20.842]  Or, on a derivative contract, that would be about $50,000 made.
[02:42:23.064 --> 02:42:26.085]  And this is from the price going down, even though you may not even own one ounce.
[02:42:26.165 --> 02:42:29.667]  This is how the banks and the government accounts were controlling the metals market.
[02:42:29.707 --> 02:42:38.031]  They would massively sell the derivatives market, driving the price down, which the cash market was then dependent upon for pricing.
[02:42:38.211 --> 02:42:41.653]  And that's now even come out on C-SPAN in federal hearings.
[02:42:41.673 --> 02:42:42.574]  They've now been caught.
[02:42:43.094 --> 02:42:49.018]  But the bottom line is, the government is just bathing in our tax money that they have invested.
[02:42:49.078 --> 02:42:50.699]  In 2008, they set up a sting operation.
[02:42:50.719 --> 02:42:51.960]  They knew the bubble was going to burst.
[02:42:52.641 --> 02:42:56.964]  And on derivative contracts, you could jump in there for five minutes, five hours, five days.
[02:42:57.004 --> 02:43:02.948]  And once you buy and sell, or sell and buy, whichever direction you're going in, you close out your trade, you're out of the picture.
[02:43:02.988 --> 02:43:04.729]  You walk with the cash if you made a profit.
[02:43:05.541 --> 02:43:09.773]  Well, being as this bubble was building on the housing market, government...
[02:43:10.399 --> 02:43:27.144]  Yeah, on their specially managed accounts, I mean the large managed accounts, both domestic and international, government outsourced in the 80s, and they have management funds, and Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Millennium Fund 1, Millennium Fund 2, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in each one of these accounts.
[02:43:28.424 --> 02:43:30.485]  And what they did was a position play.
[02:43:30.505 --> 02:43:36.767]  They went heavily short all the stock indexes, both domestic and internationally, heavily long the dollar.
[02:43:36.927 --> 02:43:38.047]  They went long the dollar.
[02:43:38.687 --> 02:43:40.468]  They went heavily long U.S.
[02:43:40.508 --> 02:43:44.029]  bonds, and they went heavily short the crude oil.
[02:43:44.749 --> 02:43:56.714]  Now, in the last two, three months of 2008, after these position plays were replaced, all of a sudden they start dumping their physical holdings in stocks, driving the market down.
[02:43:57.294 --> 02:43:59.455]  They heavily sold that crude oil more and more and more.
[02:43:59.655 --> 02:44:03.317]  Crude oil climbs from 145 a barrel down to, at the bottom peak, $28 a barrel in the low trade.
[02:44:06.878 --> 02:44:08.799]  Okay, the stock index falls apart.
[02:44:09.339 --> 02:44:10.759]  The dollar jumped.
[02:44:10.779 --> 02:44:13.700]  Everyone's saying, oh, the dollar's going down to the floor.
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:16.000]  I find that humorous.
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:27.263]  It went from 71 on the dollar index up to 89, which was in a month and a half, which was its quickest spike and run in the history of the dollar index on the upside.
[02:44:28.081 --> 02:44:32.244]  That was due to the factor as government had positioned on these positions.
[02:44:33.005 --> 02:44:40.290]  They wanted to perpetuate the collapse, so they started selling their physical holdings, which meant the pension funds took a loss and everything else.
[02:44:40.730 --> 02:44:44.293]  That took a loss all across the country as they dumped on the market.
[02:44:44.333 --> 02:44:52.039]  But this perpetuated the collapse, and thus that guaranteed them a massive profit on their derivatives plate.
[02:44:52.219 --> 02:44:53.900]  And let me stop you, let me stop you!
[02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:57.481]  Their parties in the syndicated media now come out, oh my god, this is terrible!
[02:44:57.801 --> 02:45:01.862]  Everyone's lost their money, empire's destroyed, oh!
[02:45:02.303 --> 02:45:10.806]  Well, they forget to mention that on a derivative trade, for every dollar lost in one account, a dollar is credited to another account.
[02:45:11.606 --> 02:45:20.289]  And here you had, you know, trillions, probably about 20 to 25 trillion, maybe even as high as 30 trillion worldwide that changed hands,
[02:45:21.212 --> 02:45:23.994]  Through this collapse in the derivative market.
[02:45:24.155 --> 02:45:26.356]  Yeah, but who took the other side of the trade?
[02:45:26.777 --> 02:45:28.298]  Walter, let me stop you.
[02:45:28.378 --> 02:45:28.779]  Walter!
[02:45:28.799 --> 02:45:30.260]  This is very important.
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:31.401]  A red staples button.
[02:45:32.145 --> 02:45:34.046]  And it says, uh, you know, CAFR downloads.
[02:45:34.106 --> 02:45:34.987]  Click on that button.
[02:45:35.527 --> 02:45:38.149]  It goes to my download directory, for example, CAFRs.
[02:45:38.589 --> 02:45:41.911]  But when you go down to Utah, you'll see, uh, right above it, U.S.
[02:45:41.971 --> 02:45:42.451]  Treasury.
[02:45:42.952 --> 02:45:47.694]  Click on that, and then you'll see March Derivative Report 2008 for the banks.
[02:45:48.255 --> 02:45:48.835]  Click on that.
[02:45:48.975 --> 02:45:49.676]  It's a PDF file.
[02:45:50.236 --> 02:45:56.200]  It's put out by the Comptroller of Currencies, and it shows the top, uh, 30 banks and their, uh, derivative holdings.
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:46:01.523]  Now, uh, it notes on page one, uh, second paragraph, that
[02:46:02.365 --> 02:46:10.149]  Five commercial banks controlled 97% of all derivative activity from all banks.
[02:46:11.010 --> 02:46:14.712]  Now, scroll down about two-thirds through the report, and you'll get down to Table 1.
[02:46:15.492 --> 02:46:21.175]  On Table 1, you'll see JPMorgan Chase was paying at a net worth of $1.4 trillion.
[02:46:21.216 --> 02:46:28.480]  When you look at their nominal derivative value, the value of these contracts they're trading, $90 trillion.
[02:46:29.867 --> 02:46:33.689]  Now, that $90 trillion was not JPMorgan Chase's money.
[02:46:33.769 --> 02:46:34.689]  It was for their clients.
[02:46:34.709 --> 02:46:35.429]  We gotta fade him down.
[02:46:35.469 --> 02:46:35.970]  He can't hear me.
[02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:37.430]  Alright, we're gonna go to break.
[02:46:37.450 --> 02:46:38.551]  We've got a break here, Walter.
[02:46:38.571 --> 02:46:40.792]  And we're gonna come back and let you continue with this.
[02:46:40.912 --> 02:46:42.693]  But then I want to put it back in layman's terms.
[02:46:44.573 --> 02:46:49.115]  How this global takeover has been designed and where it's going if we don't stop them.
[02:46:49.416 --> 02:46:49.996]  We'll be right back.
[02:46:52.034 --> 02:46:54.635]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:46:55.035 --> 02:46:59.997]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:47:00.377 --> 02:47:05.299]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[02:47:08.268 --> 02:47:08.929]  We're good to go.
[02:47:26.590 --> 02:47:30.092]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:47:30.412 --> 02:47:31.393]  How much will you need?
[02:47:31.633 --> 02:47:32.253]  We don't know.
[02:47:32.534 --> 02:47:33.454]  How much do you want?
[02:47:33.654 --> 02:47:34.375]  All you can get.
[02:47:34.575 --> 02:47:35.415]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:47:35.676 --> 02:47:38.437]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:47:38.718 --> 02:47:40.479]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:47:40.499 --> 02:47:41.419]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:47:51.312 --> 02:47:52.412]  Are you prepared?
[02:47:52.693 --> 02:47:54.773]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[02:47:54.993 --> 02:47:56.054]  There is a difference.
[02:47:56.374 --> 02:48:01.976]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.
[02:48:02.236 --> 02:48:05.197]  All Tactown gear has been field tested by Canadian and U.S.
[02:48:05.257 --> 02:48:06.898]  forces, so you know it's tough.
[02:48:07.058 --> 02:48:07.998]  What kind of gear?
[02:48:08.018 --> 02:48:10.119]  72-hour survival kits as low as $55.
[02:48:10.179 --> 02:48:10.779]  Holsters for $21.
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:13.460]  I think so.
[02:48:32.978 --> 02:48:36.361]  Visit TacTownGear.com right now for your preparedness needs.
[02:48:36.601 --> 02:48:39.363]  That's T-A-C-TownGear.com.
[02:48:39.643 --> 02:48:41.224]  TacTownGear.com.
[02:48:41.464 --> 02:48:43.106]  Or call TacTownGear at 418-844-9111.
[02:48:43.166 --> 02:48:43.766]  Again, that's 418-844-9111.
[02:48:51.661 --> 02:48:52.501]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:48:52.702 --> 02:48:58.024]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:48:58.224 --> 02:48:58.645]  I get it.
[02:48:58.765 --> 02:49:08.109]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:09.550]  That's not what's happening.
[02:49:09.790 --> 02:49:18.056]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:49:18.276 --> 02:49:21.538]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:49:21.658 --> 02:49:25.761]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:49:25.942 --> 02:49:26.922]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:49:27.523 --> 02:49:30.765]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:49:30.945 --> 02:49:35.068]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:49:35.288 --> 02:49:36.009]  You should, too.
[02:49:36.189 --> 02:49:37.170]  Find out what they know.
[02:49:37.331 --> 02:49:40.635]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:49:40.655 --> 02:49:40.695]  800-686-2237.
[02:49:40.715 --> 02:49:41.015]  800-686-2237.
[02:49:41.035 --> 02:49:41.235]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:49:51.175 --> 02:49:56.037]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:49:56.137 --> 02:49:56.917]  What have we got?
[02:49:57.137 --> 02:49:59.278]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:49:59.578 --> 02:50:00.318]  A republic.
[02:50:00.598 --> 02:50:03.159]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:50:03.239 --> 02:50:05.139]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:50:05.499 --> 02:50:07.400]  Two wolves in a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:08.800]  So they think they own our land?
[02:50:09.201 --> 02:50:10.321]  They think they own our water?
[02:50:10.521 --> 02:50:10.921]  Children?
[02:50:11.121 --> 02:50:11.921]  Our education?
[02:50:12.242 --> 02:50:12.882]  Our money?
[02:50:13.082 --> 02:50:16.723]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:50:17.108 --> 02:50:20.749]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:50:20.789 --> 02:50:21.769]  You have been warned.
[02:50:22.069 --> 02:50:22.890]  We have the facts.
[02:50:23.090 --> 02:50:24.210]  We have the Constitution.
[02:50:24.250 --> 02:50:25.130]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:25.990]  We have common law.
[02:50:26.051 --> 02:50:28.291]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:28.571 --> 02:50:31.292]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:50:31.512 --> 02:50:32.372]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:50:32.452 --> 02:50:37.234]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:50:37.414 --> 02:50:38.774]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:50:38.914 --> 02:50:39.754]  Don't Tread on Me.
[02:50:39.994 --> 02:50:41.215]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:43.856 --> 02:50:56.906]  Alright, Walter Berian is our guest.
[02:50:57.126 --> 02:51:00.528]  You don't have to believe Walter Berian, though he's a great guy, incredible.
[02:51:01.429 --> 02:51:05.612]  Go look up the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for your school district, you name it.
[02:51:05.652 --> 02:51:06.853]  Now since he's been exposing it,
[02:51:08.171 --> 02:51:08.651]  It's about 2,000.
[02:51:09.131 --> 02:51:12.893]  They have made the public versions that are easy to get a little thinner.
[02:51:13.833 --> 02:51:15.154]  But they'll tell you how to ferret them out.
[02:51:16.175 --> 02:51:18.796]  But, you know, I was asking the question of Walter.
[02:51:19.456 --> 02:51:24.618]  From his research, you know, it looks like this derivatives bubble they created.
[02:51:24.658 --> 02:51:28.260]  Well, we have the Timberwolf documents and others from Goldman Sachs where they admit it was engineered.
[02:51:29.281 --> 02:51:34.847]  We know it was engineered, but that it was also designed to take over many of the states, counties, and cities.
[02:51:35.768 --> 02:51:37.510]  And Walter, during the break, was agreeing with me.
[02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:46.380]  He said some states were involved, but overall, it's the federal government and big megabanks consolidated together, vertically integrating the entire economy.
[02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:48.022]  Walter, on the course we're on,
[02:51:48.823 --> 02:51:52.207]  They're now setting up their mega police state to enforce this robbery.
[02:51:54.169 --> 02:51:59.535]  What will things look like in the next year to two years if we don't somehow start reversing this?
[02:52:00.242 --> 02:52:11.949]  Well, they're creating a New World Order structure, as we all know, and the actual New World Order is being orchestrated from the United States, being that there's an expression, you know, he owns the cookie jar, makes the rules.
[02:52:11.969 --> 02:52:23.516]  If you look at the collective government investments with the banks, with the brokerage houses, with the insurance, they actually own the banks and brokerage houses and insurance companies by investment, through the primary investor.
[02:52:23.957 --> 02:52:27.539]  They own the major Fortune 500 companies by collective investment.
[02:52:28.448 --> 02:52:35.916]  Okay, so the whole structure here is to maintain this entertainment game for the population as they consolidate ownership.
[02:52:36.356 --> 02:52:44.905]  I go back to what I mentioned on the Red Staples button on my front page and going to my download directory and hitting US Treasury and getting the March derivative report for the banks.
[02:52:45.385 --> 02:52:50.250]  JPMorgan Chase was holding $90 trillion worth of nominal value and derivatives.
[02:52:50.850 --> 02:52:52.152]  Now, that was not
[02:52:52.572 --> 02:52:54.913]  Primarily JPMorgan Chase's money.
[02:52:55.333 --> 02:52:58.774]  They were acting as clearing agents for their major clients.
[02:52:58.814 --> 02:52:59.854]  Who were their major clients?
[02:53:00.314 --> 02:53:02.575]  Cities, counties, states, federal governments.
[02:53:03.395 --> 02:53:03.795]  Okay?
[02:53:04.515 --> 02:53:10.857]  And when you talk $90 trillion, as I mentioned in 2000, the entire world derivative market was $80 trillion.
[02:53:10.897 --> 02:53:17.399]  And here, in 2008, is JPMorgan Chase holding $90 trillion in nominal value of derivatives.
[02:53:18.277 --> 02:53:19.698]  Okay, and that's just one account.
[02:53:20.319 --> 02:53:37.351]  Now, if you want, one thing that will shake the earth and cause the stars to fall from the sky, metaphorically, if the public ever got the cognitive thought, you know, keep in mind, like I said, a vacuum and a void was created in the entire population's comprehension to the basics.
[02:53:38.072 --> 02:53:45.638]  But if you look at government pension funds, which they've taken over the marketplace based on their collective ownership, I put the
[02:53:46.445 --> 02:53:46.805]  We're good to go.
[02:54:04.474 --> 02:54:07.254]  Holdings, both domestic and international.
[02:54:07.795 --> 02:54:10.535]  Real estate projects, domestic and international.
[02:54:10.855 --> 02:54:13.696]  Cash loaned out to other companies, domestic and international.
[02:54:14.156 --> 02:54:15.196]  We can answer your questions.
[02:54:15.436 --> 02:54:16.556]  Oh my God!
[02:54:16.916 --> 02:54:17.916]  Look, they own it all.
[02:54:18.116 --> 02:54:19.417]  Look how much they own.
[02:54:19.677 --> 02:54:20.457]  That's just one account.
[02:54:20.497 --> 02:54:22.217]  And that's why it's New World Order.
[02:54:22.237 --> 02:54:24.857]  There are thousands of these different accounts, big and small.
[02:54:25.378 --> 02:54:33.319]  Well, that's why it's New World Order, is it's the merger of the megabanks with all the governments of the world as one big monolithic
[02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:38.272]  Corporate Borg that go and so that's why in Texas.
[02:54:38.312 --> 02:54:39.052]  They've now announced.
[02:54:39.092 --> 02:54:57.661]  This is a Houston Chronicle 1,500 plus dollar fines with license plate reading toll roads They don't even tell you it's a toll road, and then there's no judge no jury and now they take your house for a $300 unpaid water bill they take your house for a thousand dollar unpaid I mean
[02:54:57.961 --> 02:54:59.122]  It's an easy opportunity.
[02:54:59.222 --> 02:55:07.549]  And one question I've asked people, every person I've talked to, I say, would you give your 14 and 15 year old son carte blanche to write his own allowance check?
[02:55:07.569 --> 02:55:09.150]  And everyone says, no way, I would never do that.
[02:55:18.015 --> 02:55:23.219]  I said, well, that's exactly what we've done with our government, local, city, county, state, school district.
[02:55:23.579 --> 02:55:30.664]  They've been laughing all the way down to the bank every single day, playing a show game, entertaining the population with distraction and misdirection.
[02:55:32.361 --> 02:55:38.590]  You know, and the public doesn't even ask the basic questions of, you know, or forget asking the basic questions.
[02:55:38.610 --> 02:55:48.665]  The Comprehensive Annual Finance Report, or Annual Financial Report for government, shows the collective totals over years, decades, and also shows the budget.
[02:55:49.534 --> 02:55:54.218]  So, when you look at a budget report, you're just seeing the budget for the year, and a selectively created one at that.
[02:55:54.238 --> 02:56:03.465]  When you look at the annual financial report, you're seeing the decades of community, well, specialty investment funds, enterprise operations, the gross income.
[02:56:04.105 --> 02:56:07.048]  I started a disclosure, a national disclosure, in June of 98.
[02:56:08.226 --> 02:56:13.569]  of the comprehensive annual finance report and the GASB.
[02:56:14.269 --> 02:56:19.252]  Initially the report was created by GOFA.
[02:56:19.312 --> 02:56:20.072]  Got a break again.
[02:56:20.112 --> 02:56:21.733]  Long segment coming up, Walter Berrian.
[02:56:21.753 --> 02:56:22.053]  Stay there.
[02:56:22.073 --> 02:56:24.494]  We're going to come back and cover this right now.
[02:56:24.875 --> 02:56:27.136]  And again, put it in layman's terms again.
[02:56:27.676 --> 02:56:32.639]  It's a giant, crooked, swindling operation designed
[02:56:33.559 --> 02:56:38.004]  There's a financial black hole where you cannot ever pay it back.
[02:56:38.124 --> 02:56:40.086]  Things are going according to plan.
[02:56:41.608 --> 02:56:42.509]  We're on the march.
[02:56:43.009 --> 02:56:44.611]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:56:45.532 --> 02:56:48.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:56:50.933 --> 02:56:52.194]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:56:52.234 --> 02:56:57.576]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:56:57.817 --> 02:57:02.439]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:57:02.839 --> 02:57:03.239]  It's true.
[02:57:03.319 --> 02:57:05.901]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:57:06.121 --> 02:57:07.882]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:57:08.402 --> 02:57:13.105]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:57:13.626 --> 02:57:15.547]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:57:15.947 --> 02:57:20.550]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:21.651]  And here's the best part.
[02:57:21.871 --> 02:57:24.633]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:57:24.913 --> 02:57:28.235]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:57:28.556 --> 02:57:31.397]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:57:31.738 --> 02:57:33.639]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:57:33.959 --> 02:57:34.880]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:57:38.522 --> 02:57:39.183]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:57:39.963 --> 02:57:47.269]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:50.052]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:57:50.812 --> 02:57:52.434]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:58:51.144 --> 02:58:52.385]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.445 --> 02:58:57.789]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.029 --> 02:59:02.653]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:03.033 --> 02:59:03.433]  It's true.
[02:59:03.513 --> 02:59:06.095]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:59:06.336 --> 02:59:08.077]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:59:08.604 --> 02:59:13.307]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:13.827 --> 02:59:15.768]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:59:16.149 --> 02:59:20.751]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:20.952 --> 02:59:21.852]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:22.072 --> 02:59:24.834]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:59:25.134 --> 02:59:28.456]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:28.756 --> 02:59:31.598]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:31.958 --> 02:59:33.839]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:34.180 --> 02:59:35.100]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:38.735 --> 02:59:39.755]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.176 --> 02:59:47.479]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:47.779 --> 02:59:50.260]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:56.083 --> 02:59:59.184]  Folks, it's economic conquest.
[02:59:59.564 --> 03:00:05.027]  It's world government by private international banks that have come in, taken over our governments.
[03:00:06.561 --> 03:00:21.473]  From researching this, um, separately from Burien confirming what his research, the Mafia, over 80 years ago, learned in Chicago how to get cities to invest with their Mafia operations, and then basically they just keep the money.
[03:00:21.994 --> 03:00:31.742]  So they took the Chicago 1313 model, that became mainstream in the 50s, and went nationwide, they set up the national security dictatorship, uh, in 47.
[03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:37.581]  And now they own it all, and they are the imperial power.
[03:00:38.401 --> 03:00:39.362]  It's not free market.
[03:00:40.242 --> 03:00:43.443]  And now they're going to use the carbon tax to shut down any of their competition.
[03:00:43.463 --> 03:00:46.924]  I had a USA Today headline I've been meaning to cover the last two days.
[03:00:46.944 --> 03:00:48.645]  I'm going to dig through all my stacks and find it.
[03:00:48.985 --> 03:01:01.829]  But basically, they're celebrating that for the first time, payrolls dropped to record lows, worker pay shrinks, while government jobs expand.
[03:01:03.750 --> 03:01:05.272]  And I'll find that headline.
[03:01:06.353 --> 03:01:07.935]  So they're dumbing everybody down.
[03:01:07.975 --> 03:01:08.976]  They're taking over.
[03:01:10.958 --> 03:01:13.120]  Now we see governments completely imploding.
[03:01:13.380 --> 03:01:16.023]  They're saying all the pension fund money's got to go to the bankers.
[03:01:16.704 --> 03:01:20.067]  So is this just the government, from your research, with the big corporations?
[03:01:20.428 --> 03:01:21.709]  They're just running a ruse?
[03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:25.091]  Well, the corporations took over government, I think.
[03:01:25.131 --> 03:01:26.312]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:01:26.712 --> 03:01:30.074]  Government had the massive flow of equity coming into government.
[03:01:30.514 --> 03:01:40.159]  They took 5%, you know, a year, 4%, 3%, 4%, 5%, and they would invest it with the banks, the brokerage houses, corporations, equities, you know, domestic and worldwide.
[03:01:40.659 --> 03:01:43.220]  Well, you know, 5% this year, 5% the next year.
[03:01:43.260 --> 03:01:45.101]  There's only so many nickels and a dollar.
[03:01:45.501 --> 03:01:52.485]  They took it all over within three decades and owned the majority of, you know, the value through their investments.
[03:01:53.586 --> 03:02:10.482]  And going back to 1946, GFOA, Government Financial Officers Association, was created and started promoting the annual financial reporting accounting structure for government to change it into a pay-as-you-go structure, into a corporate for-profit collection vehicle.
[03:02:11.563 --> 03:02:15.106]  And, you know, they started promoting that in the cities and counties as the stage started coming on.
[03:02:15.146 --> 03:02:16.487]  By 1970, it had become the standard.
[03:02:18.321 --> 03:02:31.152]  And the group that was assigned to oversee the accounting principle was called GASB, Government Accounting Standards Board, which now writes the policy through transmittal letters on the accounting principles within the CAFRS.
[03:02:31.232 --> 03:02:33.735]  And by the way, both of those organizations are 100% private associations.
[03:02:35.783 --> 03:02:44.955]  And the boys, when they first started off GFOA, which on that 13-13 crowd was actually transitioned into Metro out of Chicago, which moved out.
[03:02:45.055 --> 03:02:49.801]  They bought 400 acres, an old horse farm outside of Louisville, Kentucky, and it's their new headquarters.
[03:02:50.828 --> 03:02:52.569]  Starting about 20 years ago.
[03:02:53.109 --> 03:03:03.816]  But the boys, you know, the international cartel of people, the wealthy families, said, well, we'll create this structure and this way we'll have an unlimited cash flow for our investments.
[03:03:03.836 --> 03:03:06.077]  We want to build a project, start a new corporation.
[03:03:06.097 --> 03:03:10.380]  Here's this money we can have invested in us, guaranteeing our success.
[03:03:10.900 --> 03:03:12.021]  And that was the initial approach.
[03:03:12.041 --> 03:03:19.586]  But as the government grew and developed and brought in more money and was making more money on their investment return, they became so massive, so large,
[03:03:20.207 --> 03:03:26.300]  That they became the controllers of the world markets based on the equity they had under management.
[03:03:26.869 --> 03:03:32.451]  They can make and break any firm, any bank, any brokerage house by that money being applied.
[03:03:32.891 --> 03:03:46.156]  Now, as I mentioned on that 90 trillion in net rotos held by JPMorgan Chase, the primary clients were local and federal government accounts, which they were ranking as the clearing agent for for those derivative positions.
[03:03:46.917 --> 03:03:51.518]  And the money just simply was sucked out of the world economy at the end of 2008, and
[03:03:54.028 --> 03:03:56.229]  You have to think of where was that equity transferred to.
[03:03:56.249 --> 03:04:03.470]  It was transferred to the specialty management accounts as a step in the takeover and consolidation of ownership.
[03:04:03.530 --> 03:04:07.832]  Now, JPMorgan Chase, all the banks that were not trading the druids, they aren't.
[03:04:08.312 --> 03:04:13.553]  By no protection, JPMorgan Chase comes in and buys out a 10, you know, 20 cents on the dollar.
[03:04:13.573 --> 03:04:17.154]  You know, as an extra perk, you know, for their cooperation.
[03:04:18.423 --> 03:04:22.386]  And this structure, as I mentioned, it's very basic.
[03:04:22.426 --> 03:04:24.628]  It's a corporate for-profit structure.
[03:04:25.228 --> 03:04:30.352]  The Annual Financial Report of Government, or they put one word at the front calling it a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[03:04:30.773 --> 03:04:32.974]  You can go on Google and do a search.
[03:04:33.014 --> 03:04:34.916]  Say, for example, you wanted the city of Burbank.
[03:04:35.556 --> 03:04:35.976]  I don't know.
[03:05:06.394 --> 03:05:07.254]  Four billion dollars.
[03:05:08.155 --> 03:05:10.336]  Seventeen and a half billion dollars.
[03:05:10.796 --> 03:05:11.056]  Okay.
[03:05:11.677 --> 03:05:14.158]  With about $250 billion in investment funds.
[03:05:14.738 --> 03:05:19.360]  When I kind of brought that note out on a national post on my email list, all of a sudden L.A.
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:20.801]  disappeared from the news headlines.
[03:05:22.602 --> 03:05:23.582]  But here's the bottom line.
[03:05:23.602 --> 03:05:24.743]  This is very important.
[03:05:24.863 --> 03:05:25.443]  So important.
[03:05:26.004 --> 03:05:32.467]  This would cause the earth to shake and the stars to fall from the heavens, metaphorically speaking, if the public bought this cognitive thought.
[03:05:33.247 --> 03:05:33.608]  I think so.
[03:05:50.171 --> 03:05:53.076]  The banks and financial institutions, number one.
[03:05:53.717 --> 03:05:56.841]  Number two, excuse me, the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:05:57.082 --> 03:06:00.267]  Pharmaceutical companies, the healthcare industry groups, number one.
[03:06:00.607 --> 03:06:05.074]  You now know why the healthcare bill passed as it passed, because it guarantees profits.
[03:06:05.795 --> 03:06:19.769]  For the government on their ownership of the health care and pharmaceutical companies, and also their participation with the insurance companies, the number one profit makers from the health care bill, guaranteed them profits by funneling in trillions of dollars of taxpayer revenue to guarantee themselves their profits.
[03:06:20.250 --> 03:06:22.892]  Number two are the financial banks and brokerage industries.
[03:06:23.493 --> 03:06:25.875]  Number three are the oil companies.
[03:06:26.276 --> 03:06:29.399]  And number four are the war industry groups.
[03:06:30.077 --> 03:06:32.578]  And we see this in every one of these large reports.
[03:06:33.039 --> 03:06:39.062]  I mentioned pension fund reports because they list the individual investments for a city or county report.
[03:06:39.362 --> 03:06:41.803]  They list totals, but not where the money is invested.
[03:06:41.863 --> 03:06:58.071]  So a good model to look at are the pension fund reports because you can be assured that the cities and counties that have specialty funds, self-insurance funds, advance for liability accounts, they're investing their money in approximately the same manner as the pension funds do.
[03:06:59.116 --> 03:07:15.184]  And when you start looking at one report after another report, you see how massive this is, how diversified world ownership, domestic ownership, real estate projects, in fact, all the pension funds I've noticed over the last two years, especially real estate spec accounts.
[03:07:15.922 --> 03:07:18.865]  To buy up commercial and property houses.
[03:07:19.065 --> 03:07:21.006]  Because they knew they were about to depress it.
[03:07:21.046 --> 03:07:21.507]  Stay there.
[03:07:22.187 --> 03:07:23.989]  I found the article out of USA Today.
[03:07:24.369 --> 03:07:30.014]  Private pay shrinks to historic lows as government payouts rise.
[03:07:30.594 --> 03:07:35.539]  But separately they're now getting, many counties are laying off half their police or more.
[03:07:35.839 --> 03:07:37.180]  They're not fixing the roads.
[03:07:37.480 --> 03:07:38.821]  They're cutting teacher pay.
[03:07:39.402 --> 03:07:41.223]  So why are they so greedy?
[03:07:41.243 --> 03:07:43.846]  I mean, if the big central banks with government
[03:07:44.656 --> 03:07:51.760]  And I say corporate takeover, because the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, and others, the Goldman Sachs people, they're in there piloting government.
[03:07:52.621 --> 03:07:55.443]  So it's these top global corporations teamed up with the government.
[03:07:55.463 --> 03:08:00.346]  I understand your point is, in dollars and cents, it's the government's taking over everything.
[03:08:01.246 --> 03:08:02.187]  But that's their force.
[03:08:02.207 --> 03:08:07.350]  They've also used the Chinese slave labor to destroy all their economic manufacturing competition.
[03:08:07.370 --> 03:08:10.732]  So this is a game of criminal scorched earth consolidation.
[03:08:11.192 --> 03:08:18.496]  My issue for you is, though, if they've already taken everything over, why are they wanting to make everybody poor, to control us?
[03:08:18.896 --> 03:08:22.858]  Why are they wanting to squeeze the teachers and the police?
[03:08:23.958 --> 03:08:26.940]  I guess because we're a bunch of dumb schmucks who put up with it.
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:27.540]  Why not?
[03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:29.161]  I mean, break down...
[03:08:30.202 --> 03:08:36.168]  From your research, I remember you 12 years ago talking about derivatives and the derivatives bomb and how they were using derivatives to take over.
[03:08:36.608 --> 03:08:40.152]  I want Walter Burien to look into the crystal ball and tell me, where is this going?
[03:08:40.552 --> 03:08:41.934]  What is their master plan?
[03:08:42.254 --> 03:08:47.880]  What's going to happen if we don't cause an awakening to this fraud and somehow reverse it?
[03:08:48.922 --> 03:09:09.253]  Well, they're creating one massive police state for the big foot on top of the entire world population with a group at the top calling all the shots, controlling all situations, and reaping the whirlwind of reward from trillions funneling into their structure, which they have control over.
[03:09:09.613 --> 03:09:13.695]  And using the carbon tax to destroy selectively any industry we try to start.
[03:09:13.735 --> 03:09:15.576]  I mean, this is total slavery.
[03:09:16.198 --> 03:09:25.760]  I go down to the point of look at those investments where they're invested as I give the examples on my web page and you'll see that every policy decision that's made from government
[03:09:26.702 --> 03:09:31.424]  Specifically, the underlying motive was to generate and create their own profits.
[03:09:31.484 --> 03:09:33.005]  Guaranteeing their own profits.
[03:09:33.085 --> 03:09:35.986]  And that's why they put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[03:09:36.326 --> 03:09:38.066]  That's why they put poison in the water.
[03:09:38.307 --> 03:09:40.908]  That's why we have government documents about how they want to kill us by 60.
[03:09:42.528 --> 03:09:45.389]  Because they're making their profits off the healthcare as they're killing us.
[03:09:45.749 --> 03:09:48.270]  They're making their profits off the wars as they kill us.
[03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:52.712]  They're making their profits off the banking as they steal people's pension funds.
[03:09:53.032 --> 03:09:55.053]  And I guess they think their police state
[03:09:55.513 --> 03:10:03.455]  Well, the key point here is they've done such an excellent, excellent job of taking over the entire investment arena.
[03:10:03.475 --> 03:10:08.276]  And I point to the government pension funds as one of the takeover vehicles.
[03:10:08.617 --> 03:10:17.319]  If you look at the return from those funds, which is massive, what I brought forward is you can create what I call a CRF, a fund tax retirement fund.
[03:10:17.964 --> 03:10:38.726]  Structure for any city, county, state, school district, where you create an exact same thing as a pension fund, but it's intentionally designed not to pay a salary and benefit of retirement, but to pay the ongoing budgetary obligations for that city, that county, that school district, so all taxation can be phased out incrementally all across the country.
[03:10:39.062 --> 03:10:45.968]  Now listen, the globalists wrote a hundred years ago that the problem of industrialization is it was going to make us all fabulously rich.
[03:10:46.468 --> 03:10:52.654]  So they finance Marx and Engels on record to come in with a new scam to con people back into slavery.
[03:10:53.274 --> 03:11:02.022]  And so basically what they've done is they've created, as Ron Paul and others have pointed out, a financial system through fractional reserve banking that is impossible to pay back.
[03:11:02.502 --> 03:11:06.185]  And so they've created a system which will enslave us again
[03:11:07.006 --> 03:11:22.699]  No matter how hard we work, and no matter what we do, they're going to raise taxes until everything goes to them, and then they're going to convert the economy to pure prisons, torture, war, and surveillance, which is then meant to carry out the mass extermination of us.
[03:11:22.759 --> 03:11:36.290]  So they're financing a giant panopticon extermination grid that funds itself in the financial consolidation of waging financial siege, shutting us off, then making us dependent on them,
[03:11:37.351 --> 03:11:43.037]  Take the definition of a takeover.
[03:11:43.057 --> 03:11:53.068]  And keep in mind, all the issues are very basic and fundamental regarding looking at the scope of the takeover, what's owned, what's bought, you know, who's doing what.
[03:11:54.076 --> 03:11:56.457]  Never, Pete, never mention their word from Syndicated Media.
[03:11:56.477 --> 03:12:02.701]  I have thousands of people calling me, Walter, how come our local newspaper or Syndicated Media doesn't report on us?
[03:12:02.741 --> 03:12:04.021]  Why don't they do their job?
[03:12:04.041 --> 03:12:06.202]  I say they do an excellent job.
[03:12:06.342 --> 03:12:11.585]  They do exactly what they're paid to do and that is not mention, a mention or a word.
[03:12:11.605 --> 03:12:13.046]  That is what they're paid to do.
[03:12:13.902 --> 03:12:14.882]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:12:15.363 --> 03:12:18.524]  Why in the last three years then have I seen a shift?
[03:12:19.464 --> 03:12:25.087]  Whereas they would lie about the government shipping in heroin and cocaine and growing it, now they just admit it and say it's for your own good.
[03:12:26.107 --> 03:12:30.749]  Before they would say Bin Laden tapes were real, now they admit they're fake and that they put them out.
[03:12:31.609 --> 03:12:34.590]  They would deny they were putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[03:12:34.890 --> 03:12:35.991]  Now they say they're there.
[03:12:36.351 --> 03:12:37.131]  It's not a problem.
[03:12:37.391 --> 03:12:38.872]  They would deny they were chemtrailing.
[03:12:39.152 --> 03:12:42.153]  Now the White House science czar comes out and says, we are spraying the skies.
[03:12:42.473 --> 03:12:43.033]  It's secret.
[03:12:43.073 --> 03:12:44.034]  It's for your own safety.
[03:12:45.834 --> 03:12:56.398]  You know, now this has become so mainstream, I'm suddenly getting on all these radio stations, most of them mom-and-pops, but some of them big ones, and the word I get is the globalists don't even care!
[03:12:57.079 --> 03:13:00.100]  They think they're so powerful now, they don't even care!
[03:13:01.417 --> 03:13:01.917]  We're good to go.
[03:13:23.889 --> 03:13:33.211]  All right, let's put this in layman's terms.
[03:13:33.351 --> 03:13:34.352]  Let's put it in layman's terms.
[03:13:34.412 --> 03:13:44.094]  If we the people take over Travis County and take the billions of dollars that they've put in investments that they never tell the public about, we could restructure that however we wanted to.
[03:13:44.634 --> 03:13:45.595]  That's the big secret.
[03:13:45.615 --> 03:13:54.344]  So you're saying we need counties and cities, as you said 12 years ago on my show, as you said four years ago, as you're saying today, this could be done anywhere.
[03:13:54.864 --> 03:14:02.592]  And the public has like some psychological brainwashing point where they just can't... I mean, has anyone tried to do what you're saying?
[03:14:03.348 --> 03:14:03.768]  We're good to go.
[03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:46.103]  And there was an economist from California, a Harvard graduate, Carl Herman, two days ago he put out two careful articles calling for a complete audit review for doing what I'm mentioning here, to phase out taxation in California.
[03:14:47.290 --> 03:14:54.558]  Uh, I made a few corrections on his articles and he's now, you know, uh, doing another, uh, economist who was a lawyer did another large article.
[03:14:54.978 --> 03:14:59.603]  But the bottom line is people are starting to get a cognitive thought of the basics.
[03:14:59.623 --> 03:15:08.173]  And they're starting to look, they're starting to digest, they're starting to see the simple reality of what I'm mentioning regarding structuring local governments.
[03:15:09.073 --> 03:15:10.334]  Okay, but I like to do this.
[03:15:10.354 --> 03:15:13.777]  We're going to come back and talk about the solution, and I agree with you in the last five minutes.
[03:15:13.837 --> 03:15:21.622]  It's similar, but on a bigger level, as to what places like states like Alaska have done.
[03:15:21.862 --> 03:15:31.528]  But as we go to break here in the next two minutes, from your study of these people and their takeover, and I've read their seminal white papers on what they're planning.
[03:15:32.489 --> 03:15:33.690]  They don't even want us here.
[03:15:34.190 --> 03:15:40.272]  They say this global financial takeover is a means to an end, that they don't like us on the earth.
[03:15:40.312 --> 03:15:42.473]  They're all a bunch of really whacked out environmentalists.
[03:15:42.513 --> 03:15:47.095]  The Goldman Sachs top people give, you know, massive money to, you know, land grabs.
[03:15:47.636 --> 03:15:51.637]  They say they want an extermination program, and I don't care, listeners, if you're laughing at that.
[03:15:51.677 --> 03:15:52.858]  I've read the documents on air.
[03:15:52.898 --> 03:15:53.878]  I made the film in-game.
[03:15:54.159 --> 03:15:54.719]  This is real.
[03:15:55.439 --> 03:16:00.001]  But from your own view financially, they want to bankrupt everything.
[03:16:00.041 --> 03:16:01.681]  They want to destroy the average person.
[03:16:03.262 --> 03:16:04.522]  A. Why do they want that?
[03:16:04.702 --> 03:16:09.284]  And B. What will the world look like and what's the time frame if we don't reverse this?
[03:16:10.310 --> 03:16:11.691]  Picture this analogy, Alex.
[03:16:11.731 --> 03:16:14.233]  Say, for example, in your neighborhood, your block, okay?
[03:16:14.654 --> 03:16:21.099]  You connive to steal everyone's net worth, and rob all their money, and take ownership of their houses indirectly.
[03:16:21.139 --> 03:16:21.899]  No one knew it was you.
[03:16:21.919 --> 03:16:28.705]  Okay, once you've stolen what they've had, and you've built up this massive empire, all neighbors become liabilities.
[03:16:30.366 --> 03:16:35.290]  You gotta either run them into the ground where they can't attack you, or around.
[03:16:35.310 --> 03:16:37.812]  Because you've stolen everything that they have.
[03:16:38.758 --> 03:16:46.640]  And on the corporate One World Order, they've managed to lock in ownership, you know, through this little bit by little bit each year.
[03:16:46.660 --> 03:16:48.661]  It's where they own it all now, by investment.
[03:16:49.341 --> 03:16:52.482]  And the public, to a certain extent, is a liability.
[03:16:53.102 --> 03:16:57.324]  Now, someone who qualifies, you know, what they're doing is a very big liability.
[03:16:57.404 --> 03:17:00.605]  You know, so I kind of watch over my shoulder every once in a while.
[03:17:01.185 --> 03:17:02.825]  But it's not me saying it.
[03:17:03.005 --> 03:17:07.947]  I've never used the word conspiracy in my entire lifetime regarding this issue.
[03:17:07.987 --> 03:17:08.167]  Never.
[03:17:08.875 --> 03:17:10.596]  It is all black and white.
[03:17:11.296 --> 03:17:19.218]  They print their own reports, and you have to sit down and start doing a look in collective totals, and you see the takeover becomes evident very quickly.
[03:17:19.438 --> 03:17:20.138]  We've got to go to break.
[03:17:20.198 --> 03:17:25.019]  Come back and finish up on that, and then Solutions will have you back very soon, especially when the new DVD comes out.
[03:17:25.039 --> 03:17:27.480]  We'll give folks your website, but that is the bottom line.
[03:17:27.700 --> 03:17:28.680]  They've stolen the world.
[03:17:29.061 --> 03:17:30.641]  They say, hey, we worked to steal this.
[03:17:30.681 --> 03:17:31.601]  You're a bunch of idiots.
[03:17:31.661 --> 03:17:32.421]  You don't even care.
[03:17:32.882 --> 03:17:35.882]  We're going to kill your butt, because the future doesn't need us.
[03:17:35.942 --> 03:17:37.523]  Human life isn't just cheap.
[03:17:38.263 --> 03:17:40.445]  It's seen as a negative.
[03:17:40.625 --> 03:17:42.946]  It's like garbage taking out the garbage.
[03:17:42.966 --> 03:17:44.287]  Well, listen, I'm not garbage.
[03:17:44.708 --> 03:17:46.229]  You're not going to kill me and my family.
[03:17:46.549 --> 03:17:47.450]  I know what you're doing.
[03:17:47.550 --> 03:17:48.330]  I'm going to fight you.
[03:17:48.610 --> 03:17:49.711]  Walter Berrian, stay there.

[03:18:50.817 --> 03:18:53.138]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:18:53.198 --> 03:18:55.399]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:18:55.519 --> 03:18:58.281]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:18:58.721 --> 03:19:03.464]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:19:03.824 --> 03:19:08.026]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:19:08.326 --> 03:19:10.667]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:19:10.687 --> 03:19:13.209]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:19:13.229 --> 03:19:16.130]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:19:16.471 --> 03:19:24.075]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:19:24.415 --> 03:19:29.680]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:19:29.800 --> 03:19:32.603]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:19:32.663 --> 03:19:36.087]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:19:36.347 --> 03:19:37.248]  And I got news for you.
[03:19:37.428 --> 03:19:38.729]  You're everyone else.
[03:19:38.769 --> 03:19:39.770]  Invisible Empire.

[03:19:52.577 --> 03:19:54.379]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[03:19:54.700 --> 03:19:55.020]  Fact.
[03:19:55.220 --> 03:19:58.564]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[03:19:58.905 --> 03:19:59.225]  Fact.
[03:19:59.525 --> 03:20:04.831]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[03:20:05.032 --> 03:20:05.312]  Fact.
[03:20:05.852 --> 03:20:09.514]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[03:20:09.834 --> 03:20:14.176]  Fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[03:21:06.165 --> 03:21:07.111]  Hey, here's an article!
[03:21:08.837 --> 03:21:09.717]  They handed it to me.
[03:21:10.037 --> 03:21:13.578]  Fox News, 80-year-old Chicago man kills armed home invader.
[03:21:13.598 --> 03:21:16.058]  And I said, where does it say they may arrest him?
[03:21:16.118 --> 03:21:17.899]  Because you're not allowed to have guns in Chicago.
[03:21:17.939 --> 03:21:18.659]  It's mob run.
[03:21:19.079 --> 03:21:26.320]  And it said that they are having to look at charges because there currently has a statute outlawing the possession of handguns.
[03:21:27.180 --> 03:21:30.061]  So, you know, they may have to arrest him.
[03:21:30.081 --> 03:21:31.321]  You're not allowed to defend yourself.
[03:21:33.081 --> 03:21:34.402]  Going back to Walter Burien.
[03:21:34.442 --> 03:21:36.822]  Walter, fire out your website for folks that want to check it out.
[03:21:37.674 --> 03:21:42.437]  It's Cafr1.com, C-A-F-R-1.com.
[03:21:42.877 --> 03:21:45.059]  Just do a search for government and wealth on Google.
[03:21:45.079 --> 03:21:47.020]  You'll get about 50 million hits.
[03:21:47.060 --> 03:21:50.942]  My website's number one in a documentary I did back in 2000 called The Biggest Game in Town.
[03:21:51.022 --> 03:21:53.904]  It was number one out of 58 million hits.
[03:21:54.384 --> 03:21:59.648]  But I mentioned an economist by the name of Carl Herman earlier out of California.
[03:21:59.668 --> 03:22:01.569]  He just his most recent article
[03:22:02.330 --> 03:22:17.501]  He put out noting that the University of California setting budgetary shortfalls, laid off teachers, had the teachers take a 10-15% cut in salary, didn't allow 2,300 students in because of budget shortfalls.
[03:22:17.901 --> 03:22:29.870]  He noted that from one-fifth of one percent, one-fifth of one percent of the investment capital that he looked at from just three local California governments,
[03:22:30.854 --> 03:22:32.215]  Would have paid the entire shortfall.
[03:22:32.715 --> 03:22:33.676]  One-fifth of one percent.
[03:22:34.576 --> 03:22:39.760]  Yeah, so the cognitive thinking is starting to click in the minds of other people from around the country.
[03:22:40.540 --> 03:23:00.093]  And as I mentioned, the earth will shake and the stars will fall when the general population gets a clue of the comprehension that they can phase out all taxation in their city, their county, their state, their school district by implementing the same investment vehicle the government used to take it all over by investment.
[03:23:01.196 --> 03:23:06.320]  And just like we exposed the Federal Reserve, we can expose this thanks to you and others' work.
[03:23:06.440 --> 03:23:13.525]  But from the math you've done, just to, you know, because I know it varies from county, city, state, federal, international, with government.
[03:23:14.206 --> 03:23:15.987]  But statistically, what is it?
[03:23:18.189 --> 03:23:23.412]  70% more money in investments that isn't on budget, and budgets are usually 30%.
[03:23:23.532 --> 03:23:26.434]  I mean, what's that ratio of money?
[03:23:26.454 --> 03:23:35.660]  Well, when you look at an annual finance report, how the large entity breaks down to their number one, part of the gross income is investment income.
[03:23:36.100 --> 03:23:38.141]  Number two is tax income.
[03:23:38.222 --> 03:23:40.263]  Number three is enterprise income.
[03:23:41.354 --> 03:23:43.275]  When you look at a budget report, it looks like 100% tax income.
[03:23:43.395 --> 03:23:46.636]  You can go over it with a fine-tooth comb, account for a nickel, dime, and penny.
[03:23:47.196 --> 03:23:54.119]  It's like if you took most of the chapters out of the Bible and looked at the first 10 chapters and told everyone to read it, and they said, oh, I've read the Bible.
[03:23:54.459 --> 03:23:55.959]  No, you've read the first 10 chapters.
[03:23:56.420 --> 03:23:57.260]  They took out the rest.
[03:23:57.300 --> 03:24:00.721]  The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report is the complete book.
[03:24:00.761 --> 03:24:02.782]  And I mention to people always
[03:24:03.722 --> 03:24:10.124]  I'll look at prior issues, because when I came out with National Disclosure, they were like, oops, we've got a problem here.
[03:24:10.284 --> 03:24:22.646]  GSB started kicking out transmittal letters, modifying the CAFR reporting from gross, shown in the collective columns, to net, shown in the collective columns.
[03:24:23.186 --> 03:24:25.327]  So there's a big difference between gross and net.
[03:24:26.047 --> 03:24:29.888]  So it's important to get older CAFRs, look at them, and then look at a newer one to see
[03:24:30.436 --> 03:24:31.496]  And the government's greedy.
[03:24:31.516 --> 03:24:40.439]  They've got plenty of money, massive investments, but they're raising taxes everywhere, threatening to steal people's pension funds, holding them financially hostage.
[03:24:40.679 --> 03:24:42.339]  Okay, say you're a cattle rancher.
[03:24:42.660 --> 03:24:45.140]  Alex, say everyone listening is a cattle rancher.
[03:24:45.860 --> 03:24:47.621]  We have a bunch of cattle out in our field.
[03:24:48.121 --> 03:24:48.901]  We take care of them.
[03:24:49.021 --> 03:24:49.702]  We protect them.
[03:24:49.842 --> 03:24:50.442]  We feed them.
[03:24:50.462 --> 03:24:51.102]  We give them hay.
[03:24:51.815 --> 03:24:55.837]  You know, every once in a while we have a nice barbecue and feed all of our friends from one.
[03:24:56.258 --> 03:25:01.221]  But the bottom line is, we're taking care of them because they're a wealth generation source for us.
[03:25:01.641 --> 03:25:04.362]  We sell our cattle to get butchered and turned into hamburgers.
[03:25:05.003 --> 03:25:14.889]  Okay, now if a lion came walking around, you know, our territory, we wouldn't mind, uh, you know, uh, you know that lion may not even be attacking our cattle.
[03:25:14.909 --> 03:25:18.371]  We're gonna shoot it because it may attack our cattle.
[03:25:21.642 --> 03:25:22.383]  We're out of time.
[03:25:22.423 --> 03:25:23.644]  That's the end of the show, Walter.
[03:25:23.684 --> 03:25:25.006]  Let me say bye to you here at the end.
[03:25:25.426 --> 03:25:28.009]  Retransmission starts now with Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:25:28.210 --> 03:25:28.810]  Right now.
[03:25:29.331 --> 03:25:30.032]  We'll be right back.

[03:25:43.330 --> 03:25:45.612]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:25:45.712 --> 03:25:48.496]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:25:48.916 --> 03:25:53.682]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:25:54.022 --> 03:25:58.227]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:25:58.527 --> 03:26:00.870]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:26:00.890 --> 03:26:03.412]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:26:03.772 --> 03:26:06.315]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:26:06.675 --> 03:26:11.200]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries.
