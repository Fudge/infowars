[00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.111]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:07.871]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.652]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.652 --> 00:00:11.232]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:12.773]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:16.974]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:21.075]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:34.356]  Big transmission lined up today.
[00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:36.457]  The markets are in turmoil globally.
[00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:39.658]  There's more riots and demonstrations in Greece.
[00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:41.859]  The police have stormed Bangkok.
[00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.359]  Much of the city is on fire.
[00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.361]  That is all coming up today.
[00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:59.305]  We've got Charlie Veitch on, who's with the Lubb Police, another citizen activist group, really having a big effect in the UK confronting globalists and exposing the false left-right paradigm.
[00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:18.540]  And we've also got Ellen Brown on who has written a book about state banks and a new monetary system in this country that empowers the people.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.001]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:31.382]  Now, I've got four big stacks of news here that we are going to be covering in the meantime.
[00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:33.744]  And we're going to have wide open phones at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:33.744 --> 00:01:33.824]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:33.824 --> 00:01:39.147]  We've got a lot of audio and video clips that we're going to be playing as well today.
[00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:43.870]  But the first thing I want to cover when we get back is the Mexican president
[00:01:53.476 --> 00:02:08.802]  To address a joint session of Congress today, traveling all over the U.S., not the first time, shaking his finger at the American people and saying he represents and he is the leader of Hispanics in this nation and that we've basically got to completely open our borders up.
[00:02:08.802 --> 00:02:10.662]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:13.203]  No other country would put up with this.
[00:02:13.203 --> 00:02:18.385]  No other country would ever stand for this violation of sovereignty.
[00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:33.773]  A foreign leader who clearly stole the election in Mexico, who's been connected to all different forms of corruption, running around telling us what to do as the American people.
[00:02:33.773 --> 00:02:36.194]  It is just incredible.
[00:02:36.194 --> 00:02:37.574]  We'll also get into the economy.
[00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:41.917]  New claims shoot higher as jobless problem persist.
[00:02:42.984 --> 00:02:55.842]  German finance minister markets are out of control banks to drop 12 to 15 percent then rebound So a lot of things happening in the markets right now
[00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:02.471]  Obama tells Mexican President we are not defined by our borders.
[00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:09.718]  That's kind of like Lindsey Graham, the Senator, saying that America is more of an idea rather than a place.
[00:03:09.718 --> 00:03:13.501]  This is all part of the North American Union takeover.
[00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:22.149]  And I put the name Rand Paul into the search engine this morning, into the NSA search engine, that's what Google is, Government Front.
[00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:32.391]  They now admittedly have vans driving around everywhere, not just taking photos of your house, but listing everything you're doing, tracking all your internet activity, just completely lawless.
[00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:36.635]  But I went into the NSA search engine Google and typed his name in.
[00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:42.620]  Tens of thousands of articles, almost all of them bashing Rand Paul and attacking him.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.884]  So the system is definitely scared of Rand Paul.
[00:03:46.884 --> 00:03:49.927]  I want to go over a Salon article.
[00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:54.623]  And they've changed the headline since I read it this morning.
[00:03:54.623 --> 00:04:01.408]  This morning it was, Alex Jones, Rand Paul is Awesome.
[00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:06.691]  And now it's Conspiracyist, Alex Jones, Rand Paul is Awesome.
[00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:07.932]  So I'm going to re-read over this article.
[00:04:07.932 --> 00:04:09.533]  It looks like it said something added to the article.
[00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:19.400]  The article looks longer as well, so I should have printed that when I was at home because the memory hole has now altered this section of the matrix.
[00:04:20.506 --> 00:04:37.619]  The toll-free number to join us to take a lot of calls today is 1-800-259-9231 on any issue, any news item, any comment, any question you've got, we'd love to hear from you today as the global awakening accelerates, as the global tyranny expands.

[00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:35.321]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[00:06:45.546 --> 00:06:49.088]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:50.489]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:51.062 --> 00:06:52.185]  It's here.

[00:07:00.183 --> 00:07:09.706]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:11.026]  My name is Crystal.
[00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:13.967]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:17.928]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:07:17.928 --> 00:07:22.069]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:22.909]  What did Crystal do?
[00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.330]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:33.258]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:07:33.258 --> 00:07:37.102]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:07:41.647 --> 00:07:41.927]  I think so.
[00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:10.430]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.991]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.533]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:17.736]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.736 --> 00:08:21.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:35.828]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:08:36.952 --> 00:08:39.212]  We're under a spell.
[00:08:39.212 --> 00:08:40.153]  It's outrageous.
[00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:42.653]  Can you imagine if a U.S.
[00:08:42.653 --> 00:09:01.816]  President went to Mexico and that there were 30 million Americans living in Mexico who were flying American flags and saying that Mexico was part of the United States and that Mexican school children couldn't wear Mexican flag shirts in Mexico?
[00:09:01.816 --> 00:09:05.997]  And then the Mexican media went along with it and said it was bad.
[00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:11.043]  That Mexican kids were wearing Mexican flags in Mexico and it was bad?
[00:09:11.043 --> 00:09:17.993]  That Mexico might want to control some of its sovereignty?
[00:09:17.993 --> 00:09:18.854]  I mean, think about this.
[00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:28.258]  Look, it's all about the North American Union, because when they set up a new economic and political order, the globalists get to set the rules.
[00:09:28.258 --> 00:09:34.559]  And we are in a North American Union, just like they officially set up the European Union in 1957.
[00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:40.560]  That's in the Treaty of Rome documents, it's in the Bilderberg Group documents.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:48.882]  In 2007, they had the 50th anniversary in the EU, with fireworks and celebrations and parades.
[00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:52.997]  But the public was told the Euro started in 2000.
[00:09:52.997 --> 00:10:00.161]  And then a few years later, they say, actually, you've been in the European Union for 50 years.
[00:10:00.161 --> 00:10:16.190]  And it's the same thing dealing with the Mexican president coming in to the United States and basically telling us our business and the media
[00:10:18.007 --> 00:10:23.229]  Reporting it like it's a good thing, like it's reasonable.
[00:10:23.229 --> 00:10:30.813]  And members of the House and Senate running around saying we've got to fix the immigration problem.
[00:10:30.813 --> 00:10:31.973]  And how do they fix it?
[00:10:31.973 --> 00:10:40.977]  Total capitulation, total open border to anybody that wants to come to this nation to then be put on welfare and to be given free medical care.
[00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:42.478]  As the United States collapses.
[00:10:44.155 --> 00:11:07.302]  All over the country, unlimited money for surveillance, unlimited money for GPS and ID biometric cards for school kids, and colleges announcing they're going to take your blood as part of entrance for a DNA database, and the police announcing they're going to take blood at checkpoints all over the country and now doing it, and the government trying to pass legislation for public DNA databases.
[00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:11.483]  They already have the DNA databases, but now they want to be able to use it and have it be public.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.322]  Unlimited money for all this control and for more prisons.
[00:11:17.322 --> 00:11:35.291]  But then meanwhile, all over the country they're announcing, we're not going to fix bridges, we're not going to fix roads, we're not going to fix sidewalks, we're going to slash all of the essential government services that government actually has a role in in the past.
[00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:38.073]  And the government has control of that infrastructure.
[00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.094]  Everything is going to the police state
[00:11:41.678 --> 00:11:51.907]  On one side of the equation, to oppress and control and extract wealth out of the people, and the rest of the money is going to interest on made-up debts to the private central bankers.
[00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:53.729]  And that is all coming up today.
[00:11:53.729 --> 00:12:00.975]  But I wanted to play this clip of Obama telling Mexican President we are not defined by our borders.
[00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:02.436]  Here is that clip.
[00:12:02.436 --> 00:12:07.320]  Finally, Mr. President, your visit speaks to a truth of our time in North America and the world.
[00:12:08.223 --> 00:12:13.069]  In the 21st century, we are defined not by our borders, but by our bonds.
[00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:17.273]  So I say to you, and to the Mexican people, let us stand together.
[00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:19.436]  Let us face the future together.
[00:12:19.436 --> 00:12:21.518]  Let us work together.
[00:12:21.518 --> 00:12:22.680]  Trabajemos juntos.
[00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:24.296]  This is treason!
[00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:58.432]  President Calderon, Senora Zavala, welcome to the United States.
[00:12:58.432 --> 00:12:59.653]  Incredible.
[00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:00.674]  Did you hear what he said?
[00:13:00.674 --> 00:13:03.495]  He called us North America.
[00:13:03.495 --> 00:13:05.957]  And he said we're not defined by our borders.
[00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.272]  Out in the open, North American Union.
[00:13:10.272 --> 00:13:21.839]  Doesn't matter who gets into office, whether it's George Herbert Walker Bush, or Bill Clinton, or George W. Bush, or Barack H. Obama, it does not matter.
[00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:32.486]  They are getting rid of that border, and they are getting rid of our sovereignty, and they've used NAFTA and GATT to de-industrialize this country.
[00:13:33.516 --> 00:13:43.046]  And if you stand up and say, I want to keep America free, I want to keep America sovereign, you are labeled an evil racist.
[00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:54.138]  If you don't want the government running your health care and making you get health care, if you don't want the government taking control of doctors and the decisions they can make, you are a racist.
[00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:55.579]  Well, this isn't going to work anymore.
[00:13:56.616 --> 00:14:01.578]  The establishment has gone too far and the people don't care about the labels anymore.
[00:14:01.578 --> 00:14:08.820]  The establishment is trying to divide the people by injecting race into all of these issues, but it's simple.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:17.643]  Mexico has lost wars with the United States, Spain, Russia, England,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:38.450]  France have all controlled parts of the Southwest and Mexico has no claim on these areas just like Spain and Russia doesn't have claims on California though both of those nations have controlled and dominated areas of the West Coast in the past.
[00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.851]  It is an asinine claim
[00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:43.113]  And what they teach Mexicans coming into the U.S.
[00:14:43.113 --> 00:14:44.815]  is, you see all these skyscrapers?
[00:14:44.815 --> 00:14:45.936]  You see all these swimming pools?
[00:14:45.936 --> 00:14:46.937]  You see all this money?
[00:14:46.937 --> 00:14:49.820]  Well, that's because the Southwest was stolen.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.140]  Oh, really?
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:57.246]  The Southwest was seen as barren and useless and worthless, except for trade routes, to the Empire of Spain.
[00:14:57.246 --> 00:14:59.509]  That's why they never put money in to defend it.
[00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:04.771]  It was seen as worthless or near worthless by Napoleon Bonaparte.
[00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:13.515]  That's why he sold much of the middle area and southern area of the country in the Louisiana Purchase for a pittance.
[00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:22.919]  Because it was just empty real estate with roving bands of natives who were also fighting and killing each other as well.
[00:15:25.327 --> 00:15:29.969]  So, the fact is, this is taught in public schools in the U.S., this is taught in schools.
[00:15:32.907 --> 00:15:37.849]  In Mexico, because it's part of this globalist takeover.
[00:15:37.849 --> 00:15:50.613]  But this is treason, to have a president up there saying we are not defined by our borders, we are defined by the region of North America and by our bonds.
[00:15:50.613 --> 00:15:55.814]  See, there he is, saying we're not going to have borders in globalist speak.
[00:15:55.814 --> 00:15:56.895]  And that's what this
[00:15:58.092 --> 00:15:59.973]  Immigration reform legislation is.
[00:15:59.973 --> 00:16:02.936]  It is a hemispheric North American Union ID card.
[00:16:02.936 --> 00:16:06.959]  They already have it issued by Mexico, the U.S., and Canada for the last two years.
[00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:10.661]  They run TV ads saying, oh, you don't have to get a passport.
[00:16:10.661 --> 00:16:14.544]  Get a North American ID card.
[00:16:14.544 --> 00:16:21.710]  And two years ago, I've got employees here in Texas, and the state of Texas basically works for the Feds and the Department of Labor.
[00:16:23.394 --> 00:16:43.419]  And two weeks before Jerome Corsi wrote about it in World Net Daily, just pointing out how real this is, I got the forms I was supposed to fill out and it said, you don't report to the Department of Labor anymore through the state of Texas, you report to the North American Union.
[00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:58.616]  So they've already officially done all of this, and Obama thinks you're so stupid, he knows you only care about basketball and football and acting cool, and so he sits right up there in front of you and says this.
[00:17:03.052 --> 00:17:12.986]  For his part, the Mexican president said some things that were a bit more restrained than what he has said in his own country, which he called the Arizona law, which has not yet to go into effect.
[00:17:12.986 --> 00:17:15.830]  An opening to hate and discrimination in that state.
[00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:19.314]  Here's what he said about Arizona's immigration law on the South Lawn.
[00:17:21.533 --> 00:17:44.237]  We can't do so with a community that will promote a dignifying life in an orderly way for both our countries, who are, some of them, still living here in the shadows with such laws as the Arizona law that is placing our people to face discrimination.
[00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:51.497]  Which is completely a lie.
[00:17:51.497 --> 00:17:53.418]  A complete lie.
[00:17:53.418 --> 00:18:01.759]  You've got 800 plus cities where the illegal aliens are let go for drunk driving.
[00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:06.501]  They're released for crimes that citizens have the book thrown at them.
[00:18:06.501 --> 00:18:08.361]  They're given preferential treatment on loans.
[00:18:08.361 --> 00:18:09.641]  They don't have to show the ID.
[00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:12.702]  Citizens have to show to get bank loans.
[00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:15.736]  Now let's go back again to that first clip.
[00:18:15.736 --> 00:18:19.097]  Obama tells Mexican President we are not defined by our borders.
[00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.697]  Here it is.
[00:18:20.697 --> 00:18:26.519]  Finally, Mr. President, your visit speaks to a truth of our time in North America and the world.
[00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:31.361]  In the 21st century, we are defined not by our borders, but by our bonds.
[00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:34.662]  So I say to you and to the Mexican people, let us stand together.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.722]  Let us face the future together.
[00:18:37.722 --> 00:18:39.083]  Let us work together.
[00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:41.445]  Trabajemos juntos.
[00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:44.487]  Okay, so basically more treason.
[00:18:44.487 --> 00:18:47.530]  He says we don't have borders.
[00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:53.054]  I want the Mexican people to pour in and to keep their rationality and to help destroy the United States.
[00:18:53.054 --> 00:18:54.756]  Let us work together in treason.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:07.743]  Let us work together with Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and other treacherous cities like Boston to harass Arizona and to lie to the public about what the law says.
[00:19:07.743 --> 00:19:19.607]  That when they have first contact on another issue of drunk driving or whatever the case may be or a robbery investigation, that if somebody is an illegal alien, we're going to take it to jail.
[00:19:19.607 --> 00:19:24.828]  You notice the feds don't care when police take citizens to jail every day for failure to ID, which is unconstitutional.
[00:19:26.462 --> 00:19:31.105]  You notice they don't care about the warrantless blood taking on the side of the highway the feds are funding.
[00:19:31.105 --> 00:19:39.991]  You notice they don't care when Obama says strip citizens of their rights and their citizenship secretly and put them into a dungeon.
[00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:40.051]  Or...
[00:19:41.124 --> 00:19:44.565]  When you're on a no-fly list, you're on a no-gun-by list.
[00:19:44.565 --> 00:19:45.545]  Now that's all fine.
[00:19:45.545 --> 00:19:48.466]  Let's butcher the Bill of Rights from one end to the other.
[00:19:48.466 --> 00:19:54.448]  But let's give special super rights to the illegal aliens because, hey, we got a country that hates America.
[00:19:54.448 --> 00:19:56.529]  We got a country of people that want to bring it down.
[00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:57.229]  Bring them in.
[00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:57.889]  We're globalists.
[00:19:57.889 --> 00:19:58.550]  We love it.
[00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.230]  This is wonderful.
[00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:01.449]  Fact.
[00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:03.051]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:20:03.051 --> 00:20:05.173]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:05.694]  Fact.
[00:20:05.694 --> 00:20:09.377]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.377 --> 00:20:09.998]  Fact.
[00:20:09.998 --> 00:20:15.504]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.504 --> 00:20:15.864]  Fact.
[00:20:15.864 --> 00:20:20.349]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:20.929]  Fact.
[00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:24.633]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.913]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.913 --> 00:21:05.294]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.294 --> 00:21:08.496]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.496 --> 00:21:13.619]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.619 --> 00:21:17.801]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.121 --> 00:21:20.584]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.584 --> 00:21:23.008]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.008 --> 00:21:26.272]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.272 --> 00:21:33.882]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.202 --> 00:21:39.604]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.604 --> 00:21:41.904]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.904 --> 00:21:46.125]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.125 --> 00:21:47.206]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.206 --> 00:21:48.546]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.546 --> 00:21:50.047]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:59.893 --> 00:22:09.920]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:16.364]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.364 --> 00:22:25.210]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:34.776]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:34.776 --> 00:22:39.759]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:41.160]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.682]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:52.745]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:53.065]  Fatigue.
[00:22:53.065 --> 00:22:53.285]  Headaches.
[00:22:53.285 --> 00:22:54.165]  Allergies and asthma.
[00:22:54.165 --> 00:22:54.746]  Chronic disease.
[00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:15.673]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[00:23:15.673 --> 00:23:22.877]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.
[00:23:22.877 --> 00:23:27.500]  Our air purifiers are specialized to fit your needs, from allergy sufferers to the sleep-deprived.
[00:23:36.391 --> 00:23:37.152]  We're good to go.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:10.425]  Before the globalists can fully and publicly collapse the United States, they've already done it, but they haven't announced it yet.
[00:24:10.425 --> 00:24:14.988]  They're stalling the population because they know the backlash is going to be so huge.
[00:24:14.988 --> 00:24:27.678]  But the public is waking up despite their propaganda and throwing out every incumbent, whether they're Republican or Democrat, in the primaries, from Utah to Kentucky, from Pennsylvania
[00:24:29.295 --> 00:24:29.355]  The
[00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:53.142]  Help these people get proper IDs.
[00:24:53.142 --> 00:24:55.684]  We want to fix the immigration problem.
[00:24:55.684 --> 00:24:58.105]  We want to secure the border by just getting rid of it.
[00:24:58.105 --> 00:25:00.767]  And it will get rid of the problem.
[00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:04.149]  If you think illegal immigration is a problem, it just makes it legal.
[00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:09.232]  Completely open borders in the North American Union.
[00:25:09.232 --> 00:25:16.397]  And this is what the Security and Prosperity Partnership documents that have come out in the news in the last three years, that we cover in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, show.
[00:25:17.383 --> 00:25:26.396]  That they are going to have a continental security perimeter from Alaska to southern Mexico on the Guatemala border.
[00:25:26.396 --> 00:25:29.480]  Unlimited immigration.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.722]  Absolutely open.
[00:25:31.724 --> 00:25:36.686]  And that's why I've noticed, though, I've heard them on talk radio, illegal aliens call into shows and they'll say, are you an illegal alien?
[00:25:36.686 --> 00:25:37.966]  They say, yeah, I'm here illegally.
[00:25:37.966 --> 00:25:38.807]  I'll do whatever I want.
[00:25:38.807 --> 00:25:39.847]  I'll travel wherever I want.
[00:25:39.847 --> 00:25:41.608]  We've had them call into this show.
[00:25:41.608 --> 00:25:46.750]  But I hear them on other talk radio shows and the host will always ask, well, are you for more illegals coming in?
[00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.671]  And most of them go, no, they're driving down my wages.
[00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:52.732]  I don't want them here.
[00:25:52.732 --> 00:25:54.193]  See, this is globalization.
[00:25:54.193 --> 00:25:55.673]  This is a race to the bottom.
[00:25:55.673 --> 00:25:57.354]  NAFTA and GATT didn't help Mexico.
[00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:10.696]  The government in the last 15 years, or longer, forced most of the indigenous groups in the interior of Mexico off of their land through UN biosphere operations.
[00:26:10.696 --> 00:26:15.019]  They then took the land, sold it off to globalists, turned it into national parks.
[00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:23.145]  They forced tens of millions of people up into Mexico City, and then north up into the Maquiladoras, and now almost all of the Maquiladoras are empty.
[00:26:23.145 --> 00:26:23.465]  You see?
[00:26:24.844 --> 00:26:29.145]  Because Mexico couldn't even compete with China.
[00:26:29.145 --> 00:26:32.727]  In the first phase, they were just competing with the U.S.
[00:26:32.727 --> 00:26:34.647]  and it helped de-industrialize the United States.
[00:26:34.647 --> 00:26:37.128]  Then the United States didn't have the money as U.S.
[00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:41.470]  consumers to buy their goods anymore.
[00:26:42.466 --> 00:26:44.867]  And so now Mexico's in worse shape.
[00:26:44.867 --> 00:26:46.809]  The United States is in worse shape.
[00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:53.212]  If every illegal alien had been forced to stay in Mexico in the last 30 years, that country would probably be free right now.
[00:26:53.212 --> 00:26:56.614]  There's no way that nation could have continued the corruption they've had.
[00:26:56.614 --> 00:27:06.340]  They've barely kept control of the population since then.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.683]  But by using the United States as a political steam valve,
[00:27:16.383 --> 00:27:27.652]  As a place to send the criminal element and others, they have been able to maintain some control, though they are a failed state.
[00:27:27.652 --> 00:27:45.707]  Meanwhile, as the bankers make their move to consolidate power globally and to fund their expansion of world government, there are all sorts of violent things happening, not just in Greece, but in Thailand, and of course Bloomberg Business reporting, Ottawa police investigate Royal Bank firebombing and
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.303]  A video of this has been released.
[00:27:50.303 --> 00:28:03.014]  Canada's government condemned a firebombing of a Royal Bank of Canada branch in Ottawa and said it is prepared to respond to any threats of violence against the group of 20 leaders summit in Toronto next week.
[00:28:12.762 --> 00:28:21.109]  Now an anarchist group has claimed responsibility for the Ottawa Bank firebombing and the National Post reports completely burned the building out.
[00:28:21.109 --> 00:28:22.130]  Why is this news?
[00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.311]  Because a bank got attacked?
[00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:31.978]  I mean an anarchist group supporting illegal aliens three weeks ago in Santa Cruz firebombed a restaurant with people in it.
[00:28:31.978 --> 00:28:33.240]  Thank God they got out of the building.
[00:28:34.636 --> 00:28:37.838]  There's debate about whether it was an illegal alien march or an anarchist march.
[00:28:37.838 --> 00:28:42.540]  Well, AP reported it was a pro-immigrants rights march that turned violent.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:49.743]  Scores of businesses, one report said 18, one said 20, had their windows all knocked out and a restaurant got set on fire.
[00:28:49.743 --> 00:28:58.748]  Imagine people marching through the streets with torches, with deadly weapons, and the police just retreated and basically did nothing and then called in backup.
[00:29:01.474 --> 00:29:09.039]  Imagine that, and it only made the local news on television.
[00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:11.381]  It did make the AP nationally.
[00:29:11.381 --> 00:29:14.603]  But notice now, this building is firebombed in the middle of the night.
[00:29:14.603 --> 00:29:18.886]  No one is in it, which does not make it attempted murder.
[00:29:18.886 --> 00:29:23.550]  It's attempted murder when you firebomb a restaurant at 10 o'clock at night in Santa Cruz.
[00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.351]  That is attempted murder.
[00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:31.713]  But this isn't even attempted murder, and it's all over the news.
[00:29:31.713 --> 00:29:34.115]  And it should be all over the news.
[00:29:34.115 --> 00:29:38.039]  But how many times have we caught anarchist groups working for the feds or big foundations?
[00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:39.019]  So that's coming up too.
[00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:40.040]  Here's another headline.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.443]  Bangkok in flames after army storms protest camp.
[00:29:43.443 --> 00:29:45.826]  And I've got news of police all over the U.S.
[00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:48.488]  training with the military for social unrest.
[00:29:48.488 --> 00:29:48.948]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.948 --> 00:29:50.790]  Your call straight ahead.
[00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.191]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.191 --> 00:29:53.713]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.714 --> 00:30:00.758]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.758 --> 00:30:03.779]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:09.103]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.103 --> 00:30:11.144]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.144 --> 00:30:16.147]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:17.327]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.327 --> 00:30:18.068]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.448 --> 00:30:20.330]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.411]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.411 --> 00:30:23.614]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.614 --> 00:30:24.955]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.955 --> 00:30:26.477]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.477 --> 00:30:31.762]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.762 --> 00:30:35.346]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.346 --> 00:30:38.810]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.370]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.271]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.271 --> 00:30:42.371]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:43.311]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.311 --> 00:30:44.412]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.412 --> 00:30:47.453]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.453 --> 00:30:49.634]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.634 --> 00:30:50.654]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:59.844 --> 00:31:01.144]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.144 --> 00:31:06.726]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:11.748]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:11.748 --> 00:31:16.790]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:22.554]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:22.554 --> 00:31:24.855]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:31:24.855 --> 00:31:29.658]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:29.658 --> 00:31:30.779]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:33.841]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:31:33.841 --> 00:31:37.464]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:37.464 --> 00:31:40.666]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:40.666 --> 00:31:42.887]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:42.887 --> 00:31:43.808]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.412]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:50.412 --> 00:31:56.515]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:59.637]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:59.637 --> 00:32:01.298]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:01.298 --> 00:32:04.660]  You've heard me talk about Cal Bend 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.883]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[00:32:20.971 --> 00:32:23.614]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:32:23.614 --> 00:32:30.140]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.642]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:32:51.675 --> 00:32:52.175]  Thank you!
[00:33:07.284 --> 00:33:12.448]  We are back live, going to your calls here in just a moment, but going back to this National Post article.
[00:33:12.448 --> 00:33:17.051]  Anarchist Group claims Ottawa Bank firebombing.
[00:33:17.051 --> 00:33:23.576]  The video taped firebombing of a Royal Bank of Canada branch in Ottawa last
[00:33:25.486 --> 00:33:28.229]  Well, it was in the early morning hours yesterday.
[00:33:28.229 --> 00:33:29.971]  Morning could be a sign of things to come.
[00:33:29.971 --> 00:33:37.760]  Anarchist websites are threatening militant and confrontational action during the summit of G8 and G20 world leaders.
[00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:44.222]  Yeah, you don't give us carbon taxes, we burn you out.
[00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:47.165]  And it goes on here with the police saying that the anarchists are always trying to
[00:34:02.512 --> 00:34:22.570]  Interfere with them and incite them when the police were caught the Royal Mounted Police two years ago This was in the National Post as well as the Toronto Star dressed up like anarchist attacking other police on video camera in front of the news so they have a pretext to attack the peaceful crowds
[00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:26.011]  So that is some of the other news that is coming up.
[00:34:26.011 --> 00:34:29.873]  I also want to get into the vicious attacks on Rand Paul.
[00:34:29.873 --> 00:34:31.875]  The system is really scared.
[00:34:31.875 --> 00:34:37.058]  We'll also get into the latest developments with the economy today.
[00:34:37.058 --> 00:34:39.740]  And we do have two guests coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.522]  But right now, let's talk to Joshua in Florida.
[00:34:42.522 --> 00:34:43.202]  You're on the air.
[00:34:43.202 --> 00:34:44.663]  Welcome.
[00:34:44.663 --> 00:34:45.584]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:45.924]  Pretty good.
[00:34:46.673 --> 00:34:53.357]  I was curious if you had an opportunity to see the new commercial, like the PR, put out by the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:54.337]  Have you seen that yet?
[00:34:54.337 --> 00:34:56.639]  Yes, I meant to cover that two weeks ago.
[00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.941]  That was in my list, in my stack to cover.
[00:34:59.941 --> 00:35:05.844]  We wrote an InfoWars.com story with the title, Council on Foreign Relations Propaganda.
[00:35:05.844 --> 00:35:08.465]  In fact, guys, will you pull that article up and get that video ready?
[00:35:08.465 --> 00:35:10.126]  I know we have it in the computer.
[00:35:10.126 --> 00:35:12.267]  And perhaps I'll have time to play that next hour.
[00:35:12.267 --> 00:35:12.968]  What did you think of it?
[00:35:13.931 --> 00:35:15.932]  I just thought it looked like total propaganda.
[00:35:15.932 --> 00:35:25.497]  I was wondering if you were going to do like a breakdown on it or whatever, but you know, it's weird that they're finally kind of unveiling themselves, you know, here as we see everything is becoming so much more overt.
[00:35:26.468 --> 00:35:33.654]  Well, did you hear the Zbigniew Brzezinski audio and video we played yesterday, where he admitted the world government's in trouble?
[00:35:33.654 --> 00:35:39.138]  This is the first time everybody worldwide is waking up to us and we've got a problem.
[00:35:39.138 --> 00:35:54.731]  I mean, they have tried to lie to people and say there's no such thing as a world government, but now they know that the public is awake to their lies, so they're coming out and having Angelina Jolie and others tell us how great the CFR is and how they love us and how they care about us.
[00:35:55.902 --> 00:35:56.483]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:56.483 --> 00:35:59.886]  I saw that and I also saw something pretty disturbing from CNN.
[00:35:59.886 --> 00:36:02.609]  They did a piece called American Al Qaeda.
[00:36:02.609 --> 00:36:14.041]  I don't know if you got a chance to watch that, but it actually just shows this gentleman and his road to radicalization, his road to Al Qaeda, and it said what happened was he was spending too much time on the internet and he came to believe that
[00:36:20.439 --> 00:36:23.863]  Yes, I did see some short clips of it online a few days ago.
[00:36:23.863 --> 00:36:26.485]  It aired over the weekend with Anderson Cooper.
[00:36:26.485 --> 00:36:39.137]  And I've been explaining forever that they're going to gear up and talk about white Al Qaeda, American Al Qaeda, and tie it to in the Fed movements, Tea Parties, 9-11 truthers, anybody that doesn't trust the government.
[00:36:39.537 --> 00:36:40.698]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:43.119]  I found a little bit of an interesting predicament when you were calling.
[00:37:04.881 --> 00:37:10.628]  You know, blaming Obama for treason because the only person in this country that's committing treason is you.
[00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:14.353]  Okay.
[00:37:14.353 --> 00:37:16.095]  You guys deny global warming.
[00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:16.736]  You think that
[00:37:17.478 --> 00:37:19.920]  Arabs had absolutely nothing to do with 9-11.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.705]  You guys were left behind by science, none of your points are believed by any sector of society.
[00:37:24.705 --> 00:37:28.708]  For God's sake, Alex, yesterday you compared us to glowing worms.
[00:37:28.708 --> 00:37:29.809]  What's wrong with you?
[00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:32.612]  People out there listening right now, don't believe this hack.
[00:37:32.612 --> 00:37:33.593]  He's a fraud.
[00:37:33.593 --> 00:37:34.834]  He's a loser.
[00:37:34.834 --> 00:37:39.578]  He makes millions of dollars a year and he wants people like you to send in money to him.
[00:37:39.578 --> 00:37:40.339]  Don't believe it!
[00:37:40.339 --> 00:37:41.139]  He's a fraud!
[00:37:42.466 --> 00:37:45.989]  All right, I'm going to put you on hold, Justin, and then I'm going to try to go to this point by point.
[00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:47.650]  We do make millions of dollars a year.
[00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.312]  You are absolutely right.
[00:37:49.312 --> 00:38:02.283]  And we spend millions of dollars a year on our 10,000 plus square foot facility, and my $400,000 a year bandwidth bill, and my 20 plus employees and contractors.
[00:38:02.283 --> 00:38:03.484]  You bet.
[00:38:03.484 --> 00:38:08.969]  We probably make half as much money as a popular barbecue stand here in Austin.
[00:38:10.436 --> 00:38:21.218]  I wish we made $5,000,000 a year instead of $2,000,000 a year because then I could really expand what we're doing and put out more films for free for everyone.
[00:38:21.218 --> 00:38:23.198]  How dare I?
[00:38:23.198 --> 00:38:28.800]  How dare I make 20 plus films and write books and publish books and produce documentaries?
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.041]  How dare I sell them so that I hopefully get enough money back to make another one?
[00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:36.341]  Some films lose money, some films make money.
[00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:38.102]  and are put back into the operation.
[00:38:38.102 --> 00:38:39.523]  How dare I?
[00:38:39.523 --> 00:38:42.906]  Notice he calls in and plays that money card.
[00:38:42.906 --> 00:38:47.189]  You've got trillions of dollars of your tax money disappearing into offshore banks.
[00:38:47.189 --> 00:38:56.876]  They won't tell Congress, they won't tell the British Parliament, they won't, the EU government won't tell the member states where the money goes, but that's not a problem.
[00:38:56.876 --> 00:38:58.418]  I'm a hack.
[00:38:58.418 --> 00:39:00.079]  I'm a fraud.
[00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:05.043]  So see, first he has that ad hominem, divide and conquer,
[00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:10.876]  Class warfare statement that he throws out.
[00:39:10.876 --> 00:39:12.498]  That's what the mainstream media always does.
[00:39:12.498 --> 00:39:17.264]  You know, they can pay their reporters five million dollars a year to read off a teleprompter.
[00:39:17.264 --> 00:39:21.069]  Then he says I'm a hack and a fraud.
[00:39:22.014 --> 00:39:24.515]  Because I have exposed global warming.
[00:39:24.515 --> 00:39:29.217]  Sir, we have the internal emails that they're hiding the decline.
[00:39:29.217 --> 00:39:32.059]  They now admit the earth has been cooling for a decade.
[00:39:32.059 --> 00:39:34.019]  It stopped warming 15 years ago.
[00:39:34.019 --> 00:39:37.621]  Okay, stopped warming 15 years ago.
[00:39:37.621 --> 00:39:41.443]  Then five years into stopping warming, the cooling began.
[00:39:41.443 --> 00:39:48.166]  The UN and others and universities have been caught faking the temperature data numbers from the thermostats and buoys.
[00:39:49.126 --> 00:39:53.190]  I mean, if I went over the fraud again, we've covered it ad nauseum.
[00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:57.193]  It's covered in Endgame, it's covered in Obama Deception, it's covered in Fall of the Republic.
[00:39:57.193 --> 00:40:09.705]  I mean, this is a fact, sir, and even if you believe carbon dioxide is a deadly nerve gas, you know, this is just so horrible and kills everything that it comes in contact with, cutting our emissions
[00:40:11.192 --> 00:40:17.413]  When China and India and Mexico and others aren't cutting them, we'll only increase emissions.
[00:40:17.413 --> 00:40:18.854]  See, we have less emissions here.
[00:40:18.854 --> 00:40:21.674]  We have cleaner standards, if you believe carbon dioxide's bad.
[00:40:21.674 --> 00:40:29.576]  So, going to China and India, where they have no emissions controls, will increase the devil gas.
[00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:36.137]  Now, saying I have compared people to worms is not what I did.
[00:40:36.137 --> 00:40:38.898]  But, let me explain it again in case you missed it.
[00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:46.732]  I talked about how much greater and more powerful and intelligent humans are compared to a glow worm.
[00:40:46.732 --> 00:40:55.380]  And I talked about if you're walking through the woods at night, one little glow worm, you can barely even see it in the dark of night glowing there on the forest floor.
[00:40:56.345 --> 00:41:18.558]  But when there are thousands and thousands of glowworms who are out there mating, and so they glow as part of their mating process to adversitize themselves, like a peacock puts out its feathers and does a dance to the female, that together in the aggregate it creates a lot of light.
[00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:28.765]  And so I went on with the analogy of humans poking holes in the electronic Berlin Wall of lies and then how the sunshine of truth pours in.
[00:41:31.471 --> 00:41:36.693]  So, another false statement by you.
[00:41:36.693 --> 00:41:45.117]  Quite frankly, I just went into the analogy because I was thinking about walking around in the forest at night and how much I love it and how I never get to do it.
[00:41:45.117 --> 00:41:48.259]  So, another bizarre statement from you.
[00:41:48.259 --> 00:41:50.780]  We told folks that gold was going to go from 300 to above 1,000 seven years ago.
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:50.900]  It has.
[00:41:53.101 --> 00:41:53.361]  I think?
[00:42:13.467 --> 00:42:17.310]  cemeteries in New York State and other documents.
[00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.031]  Of course, that then happened.
[00:42:19.031 --> 00:42:26.856]  We talked about how they were going to create a derivatives bomb to bring down the world markets and get the nation states in greater debt to the private central banks.
[00:42:26.856 --> 00:42:36.682]  We talked about how they would take trillions of dollars, not eight hundred billion, and that they would not tell Congress where the money went and that they would not spend it to unfreeze mortgages.
[00:42:36.682 --> 00:42:38.743]  They've since clamped down even more.
[00:42:38.743 --> 00:42:39.444]  That all happened.
[00:42:39.964 --> 00:42:41.986]  Uh, everything we've talked about has happened.
[00:42:41.986 --> 00:42:55.438]  I told you back in January of last year that Obama's approval rating would go from 80% into the low 40s or even lower, and that he would continue torture, secret arrest, expand wars, hire nothing but lobbyists, and then his real name's Barry Sitaro.
[00:42:55.438 --> 00:42:57.640]  That's now all mainstream news and admitted.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.620]  Uh, so, you know what?
[00:42:59.361 --> 00:43:06.646]  Whether you like it or not, Justin, everybody's starting to listen to what we have to say, because unlike you, they are intelligent.
[00:43:06.646 --> 00:43:12.189]  So, you call in so emotional, your voice shaking, like I'm gonna cut you off any minute.
[00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:16.272]  The truth is, uh, Justin, uh, not Joshua, sorry, that was another caller.
[00:43:16.272 --> 00:43:21.576]  The truth is, uh, I love callers like you, uh, because
[00:43:22.256 --> 00:43:38.384]  For whatever reason, maybe you weren't breastfed, maybe you sat in front of the television for 12 hours on end with crap-filled diapers, and when I say you weren't breastfed, and I've put this out before and a lot of them get mad and say, well, no, I wasn't breastfed.
[00:43:38.384 --> 00:43:43.206]  You don't get the fats you need for brain growth in the first year and a half.
[00:43:43.826 --> 00:43:50.191]  uh... without the milk that the uh... female mammal homo sapiens sapiens produces.
[00:43:50.191 --> 00:43:51.892]  See, those breasts are for a reason.
[00:43:51.892 --> 00:43:53.993]  They're designed to feed you.
[00:43:53.993 --> 00:43:56.915]  Now my mother breastfed me till I was eighteen months old.
[00:43:56.915 --> 00:43:59.197]  I've got a big brain, okay?
[00:43:59.197 --> 00:44:00.638]  I got my full development.
[00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:03.099]  And I'm sorry you were given formula.
[00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:13.968]  I'm sorry your parents bought into, you know, easy living, and the media told them it was okay to give you formula designed so that you would not have good brain development.
[00:44:13.968 --> 00:44:18.371]  And I mean, let me guess, you were not breastfed, were you, Justin?
[00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:22.294]  Listen to me, the only reason you got called... Shut up and answer my question!
[00:44:22.294 --> 00:44:23.335]  Shut up, punk!
[00:44:23.335 --> 00:44:24.576]  Shut up, coward!
[00:44:24.576 --> 00:44:27.518]  I'm asking you, your mommy didn't breastfeed you, did she?
[00:44:28.257 --> 00:44:28.717]  No!
[00:44:28.717 --> 00:44:32.880]  The only reason you have people like me calling in is to see what kind of crap you're selling!
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.401]  You're a coward, Justin.
[00:44:34.401 --> 00:44:36.562]  You're a coward and you're scum.
[00:44:36.562 --> 00:44:37.983]  And it doesn't matter what you say.
[00:44:37.983 --> 00:44:41.466]  Everybody knows global warming's a fraud now, punk.
[00:44:41.466 --> 00:44:44.228]  And we've got the courage to expose it when it's unpopular.
[00:44:44.228 --> 00:44:45.228]  Now it's popular.
[00:44:45.228 --> 00:44:48.570]  We've got the courage to expose 9-11 when it's unpopular to do it.
[00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:49.831]  Because we don't care.
[00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:51.012]  You understand that, Justin?
[00:44:51.012 --> 00:44:53.053]  I'm sorry mommy didn't take care of you.
[00:44:53.053 --> 00:44:54.374]  Okay?
[00:44:54.374 --> 00:44:56.796]  I'm sorry you've got a little shriveled brain, Justin.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.704]  You're a shell!
[00:45:02.523 --> 00:45:03.884]  Yeah!
[00:45:03.884 --> 00:45:05.325]  I love it, coward!
[00:45:05.325 --> 00:45:08.127]  Yeah, I'm a coward, alright!
[00:45:08.127 --> 00:45:09.488]  Hey, Justin, put him on hold.
[00:45:09.488 --> 00:45:11.310]  Go on the internet and make up more lies about me.
[00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.170]  It only helps me.
[00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.993]  Just point everybody at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:15.993 --> 00:45:19.896]  Now, I illustrate the breastfeeding issue because the studies are out there.
[00:45:19.896 --> 00:45:22.118]  You can pull them up.
[00:45:22.118 --> 00:45:26.722]  Breastfeeding, higher IQs, larger brain cc size, and
[00:45:30.037 --> 00:45:30.738]  It's just a fact.
[00:45:30.738 --> 00:45:42.726]  And I also get up here and warn people about giving their children sodium fluoride because it can cause upwards of a 20 point IQ reduction if your children drink sodium fluoride or brush their teeth with sodium fluoride.
[00:45:42.726 --> 00:45:46.168]  So I can illustrate this to people.
[00:45:46.168 --> 00:45:48.490]  And I'm not saying parents are bad that gave their children formula.
[00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:50.692]  They believed what the government told them.
[00:45:51.516 --> 00:45:55.485]  They believed that it was a good thing.
[00:45:55.485 --> 00:46:00.194]  They believed that different forms of birth control wouldn't sterilize them.
[00:46:01.167 --> 00:46:10.831]  Like we had in this country in the 70s and 80s with the devices they would implant in women's uteruses that were designed to destroy their fertility.
[00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:15.813]  They believed that soy was good for them when it massively reduces fertility.
[00:46:15.813 --> 00:46:20.875]  And so, look, I understand, and I should actually be very sad for you.
[00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:23.035]  I'm not being sarcastic right now.
[00:46:23.035 --> 00:46:24.156]  I understand that you're angry.
[00:46:25.086 --> 00:46:26.767]  Okay, but don't worry.
[00:46:26.767 --> 00:46:29.028]  The globalists are destroying America.
[00:46:29.028 --> 00:46:31.610]  Our industrial base is basically gone.
[00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:32.750]  Okay?
[00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:33.971]  Okay?
[00:46:33.971 --> 00:46:36.112]  And don't worry.
[00:46:36.112 --> 00:46:37.713]  You don't have much of a future, Justin.
[00:46:37.713 --> 00:46:39.915]  You're going to have it the way you want it.
[00:46:39.915 --> 00:46:40.775]  All right?
[00:46:40.775 --> 00:46:41.395]  Don't worry.
[00:46:41.395 --> 00:46:43.136]  The globalists might beat people like me.
[00:46:43.136 --> 00:46:44.537]  You might win.
[00:46:44.537 --> 00:46:45.978]  Okay?
[00:46:45.978 --> 00:46:47.439]  All right.
[00:46:47.439 --> 00:46:50.761]  Tell you what, that was a real moron.
[00:46:53.378 --> 00:46:54.879]  Oh boy.
[00:46:54.879 --> 00:46:55.920]  Who's up next here?
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.941]  Howard and Philly?
[00:46:57.941 --> 00:46:58.922]  Howard, you're on the air.
[00:46:58.922 --> 00:46:59.362]  Go ahead.
[00:46:59.362 --> 00:47:01.624]  I gotta tell you something.
[00:47:01.624 --> 00:47:04.626]  I'm aggravated how much time you just gave that guy.
[00:47:04.626 --> 00:47:12.071]  You got people on hold with good info, and you let him allow you to degenerate down to his level.
[00:47:15.376 --> 00:47:31.122]  I'm looking at the time and I'm sitting here... He was getting upset though, because I guarantee you that poor guy comes from a single parent family, not attacking single parent families, but it's a fact, and that guy just didn't have great parents, and he has a small brain, and I feel sorry for him.
[00:47:31.122 --> 00:47:31.903]  Go ahead.
[00:47:31.903 --> 00:47:35.784]  Alex, I understand that, but why did you... That's not my topic.
[00:47:35.784 --> 00:47:37.085]  Yeah, let's not spend any more time on it.
[00:47:37.085 --> 00:47:39.246]  Go ahead, you're doing what I did.
[00:47:39.246 --> 00:47:40.366]  Well, to a degree.
[00:47:40.919 --> 00:47:42.620]  Let's talk about Thailand.
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.180]  I got a couple things I want to tell you.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:48.542]  I lived in Thailand for three years, from 2006 until 2009.
[00:47:48.542 --> 00:47:52.923]  I know Thais, I know Thailand, I know exactly what's going on there.
[00:47:52.923 --> 00:48:00.366]  And everybody's been giving explanations and not really simplifying it so that the American audience can understand what's happening over there.
[00:48:00.366 --> 00:48:02.827]  It's so simple, it's not funny.
[00:48:02.827 --> 00:48:06.068]  The yellow shirts are for the monarchy.
[00:48:06.068 --> 00:48:09.889]  The monarchy funds the yellow shirts that were allowed to take over the airport
[00:48:10.393 --> 00:48:12.435]  Two airports while I was there.
[00:48:12.435 --> 00:48:15.978]  They didn't fire a shot at them, there was no violence, there was hardly anything.
[00:48:15.978 --> 00:48:26.327]  The police stood there, watched them take over the airport, watched them inconvenience everybody traveling in and out of Thailand, or traveling through Thailand, and it became the laughing stock.
[00:48:26.327 --> 00:48:31.631]  But the monarchy doesn't care, because the monarchy's got a vice grip on the people.
[00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:37.997]  They've stolen most of the money from the people as it is, and the people who are wearing the red shirts
[00:48:38.641 --> 00:48:47.689]  Are the ones who were voted into political power, whether or not Paxson was a corrupt scumbag, which he was, he was still voted in properly.
[00:48:47.689 --> 00:48:49.370]  And they were removed twice.
[00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:50.651]  And they're angry.
[00:48:50.651 --> 00:48:56.957]  They want their country, and they're tired of the monarchy dictating how things go, because it isn't working.
[00:48:56.957 --> 00:48:58.638]  And they can see that.
[00:48:58.638 --> 00:49:03.102]  There is a huge United States influence in Thailand.
[00:49:03.102 --> 00:49:06.205]  And just to understate that point, uh, underscore that point,
[00:49:06.661 --> 00:49:10.963]  My wife went to open a bank account two years ago in Thailand, but she's a thai.
[00:49:10.963 --> 00:49:14.284]  They handed her the requisite ten forms to fill out.
[00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:17.985]  She shows me this one form, and she says, why are they asking me these questions?
[00:49:17.985 --> 00:49:19.026]  I said, well, what's on the form?
[00:49:19.026 --> 00:49:20.506]  It was all in Thai.
[00:49:20.506 --> 00:49:21.787]  I said, well, what are they asking you?
[00:49:21.787 --> 00:49:26.509]  She says, well, what I do, how I make my money, where I spend my money.
[00:49:26.509 --> 00:49:29.430]  And I look on the top of the form, and it's small letters at the top.
[00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:34.772]  The only English on the entire form was, know your customer.
[00:49:36.072 --> 00:49:44.296]  So here we've got the Know Your Customer program instituted in the Thai banking system from the Americans.
[00:49:44.296 --> 00:49:47.598]  Now, here's the third thing I want to tell you.
[00:49:47.598 --> 00:50:02.065]  Three days ago in Philadelphia, 75 police cars, Homeland Security vehicles, all with sirens blazing, lights going, went through Center City, Philadelphia at 1030 in the afternoon and scared the hell out of a lot of people.
[00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:12.416]  Now, I find these things very curious because when I went to search the next day on Google or look in the local newspapers, there was nothing about it.
[00:50:12.416 --> 00:50:17.358]  Well, what's happening everywhere is they're doing counter-terrorism drills and riot control drills.
[00:50:17.358 --> 00:50:22.560]  I mean, I literally see scores of articles every day to acclimate the public.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:30.144]  The Pentagon admits that's what all this urban warfare training is for, is to condition and acclimate the population.
[00:50:30.144 --> 00:50:31.785]  And so that's what's happening here, my friend.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.861]  Well, here's the question, though.
[00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:36.623]  How do they keep this from the papers?
[00:50:36.623 --> 00:50:44.849]  The only reason that I know about it, I wasn't downtown at the time, is that I saw it on the 10 o'clock Fox News.
[00:50:44.849 --> 00:50:49.313]  And they were talking about it in terms of it was like a scene out of 24.
[00:50:49.313 --> 00:50:51.114]  That was Monday night when they showed 24.
[00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:53.556]  We'll check into it.
[00:50:53.556 --> 00:50:55.197]  I appreciate your call.
[00:50:55.197 --> 00:50:56.978]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:56.978 --> 00:50:57.439]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.904 --> 00:51:04.125]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.125 --> 00:51:06.626]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.626 --> 00:51:08.527]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.527 --> 00:51:15.751]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.751 --> 00:51:20.133]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:20.133 --> 00:51:30.459]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:30.879 --> 00:51:31.500]  We're good to go!
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:05.302]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:52:05.302 --> 00:52:06.562]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.562 --> 00:52:10.184]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:10.184 --> 00:52:12.725]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.725 --> 00:52:18.588]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:52:18.588 --> 00:52:24.831]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:31.236]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:31.236 --> 00:52:35.419]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:39.702]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.702 --> 00:52:45.647]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.647 --> 00:52:49.210]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:50.591]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:51.164 --> 00:52:52.286]  It's here.

[00:55:56.135 --> 00:56:04.018]  Just for you, because I've been looking at the bills here and revenue's gone down because the economy's falling apart, our audience has doubled in the last year.
[00:56:04.018 --> 00:56:07.939]  Imagine other media whose audience isn't doubling every year.
[00:56:07.939 --> 00:56:14.241]  If our audience is doubling and revenue's down because the economy's so shot, can you imagine people who haven't been doubling their audience what it must be like?
[00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:19.142]  So, we'll be sure to do a Money Bomb just for Justin as well.
[00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:21.763]  Just for you, Justin, and for people that want to support us.
[00:56:21.763 --> 00:56:23.423]  But you can write to me, P.O.
[00:56:23.423 --> 00:56:24.564]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:56:24.564 --> 00:56:27.004]  Or you can call and get the books and videos at 888-253-3139.
[00:56:27.004 --> 00:56:30.005]  Okay, let's go to Blue Dove Fury in Florida.
[00:56:30.005 --> 00:56:30.525]  Thanks for holding.
[00:56:44.016 --> 00:56:45.777]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:56:45.777 --> 00:57:03.562]  Well, first I have several things to talk about, but to the young man that called in, he sounds like one of the state troopers and Massachusetts police officers who tried to rape me when I lived in Foxborough, Massachusetts.
[00:57:03.562 --> 00:57:04.582]  I want to say this.
[00:57:04.582 --> 00:57:08.583]  I knew the police force, and there were good police and there were bad.
[00:57:08.583 --> 00:57:12.084]  And let me tell all of America, there are good police.
[00:57:13.237 --> 00:57:15.198]  But there are really bad.
[00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:18.059]  I tried to go to the Civil Rights Department for this.
[00:57:18.059 --> 00:57:21.720]  They harassed me and staked out in front of my house.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.320]  We had to keep the blinds closed.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.602]  My husband was a CEO and lived most of the time in Europe.
[00:57:27.602 --> 00:57:34.824]  I eventually divorced my husband over certain issues, going back to his family being Persian.
[00:57:34.824 --> 00:57:38.746]  I married a general from Iran, son.
[00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:42.344]  Ma'am, I think you called in with this story before.
[00:57:42.344 --> 00:57:43.244]  Send me an email about it.
[00:57:43.244 --> 00:57:44.684]  I'd like to see the specifics.
[00:57:44.684 --> 00:57:46.084]  I appreciate the call.
[00:57:46.084 --> 00:57:49.085]  Joe in Hawaii, you're on the air.
[00:57:49.085 --> 00:57:49.845]  Hello?
[00:57:49.845 --> 00:57:51.226]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:57:51.226 --> 00:57:54.706]  Yes, I'm calling to talk about 2001 when 9-11 happened.
[00:57:54.706 --> 00:57:58.067]  It was interesting how that happened in that year because
[00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:17.046]  Because they go by 2001 to 3000, you know, as a decade, I mean, as a century, I mean, and nobody ever talks about that.
[00:58:17.046 --> 00:58:19.710]  I wanted to get your comment about that.
[00:58:20.694 --> 00:58:27.359]  Well, the globalists are obsessed with numerology, and there was a lot of strange stuff that went on with that on 9-11.
[00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:35.925]  But I'm going to continue with open phones and your calls, but I would ask listeners, are you mad about the Mexican president here in the U.S.
[00:58:35.925 --> 00:58:37.546]  telling us what to do?
[00:58:37.546 --> 00:58:38.187]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:46.454]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.454 --> 00:58:50.396]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.396 --> 00:58:52.778]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:52.778 --> 00:58:55.099]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:55.099 --> 00:58:58.301]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:58.301 --> 00:59:03.404]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:03.404 --> 00:59:07.607]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:07.907 --> 00:59:10.269]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:10.269 --> 00:59:13.152]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:13.152 --> 00:59:16.055]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:16.055 --> 00:59:23.663]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:59:23.996 --> 00:59:29.398]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:59:29.398 --> 00:59:32.239]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:59:32.239 --> 00:59:35.921]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:59:35.921 --> 00:59:37.001]  And I got news for you.
[00:59:37.001 --> 00:59:38.342]  You're everyone else.
[00:59:38.342 --> 00:59:39.842]  Invisible Empire.

[01:00:08.286 --> 01:00:10.048]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.048 --> 01:00:11.649]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:12.589]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:17.393]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.393 --> 01:00:22.317]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.317 --> 01:00:31.084]  Wade Madsen, investigative journalist, joining us in 30 minutes to talk about a host of issues, the economy, inside info on the BP spill.
[01:00:31.084 --> 01:00:33.365]  Kurt Nemo's got an article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:36.192 --> 01:00:47.807]  And it shows video from CBS News of private BP contractors backed up by the Coast Guard saying that CBS News can't go to public beaches and shoot video of the oil.
[01:00:48.803 --> 01:00:50.984]  I mean, that's tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:54.667]  That's the American people being shoved around like this is a third world nation.
[01:00:54.667 --> 01:01:02.972]  That's all coming up as well, plus the latest on Rand Paul and incumbents being thrown out in primaries all over the United States.
[01:01:02.972 --> 01:01:05.353]  Very exciting information.
[01:01:05.353 --> 01:01:06.994]  Michael in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:01:06.994 --> 01:01:08.575]  Welcome.
[01:01:08.575 --> 01:01:14.519]  Alex, you know, I am a PPTV member, and you know what?
[01:01:14.519 --> 01:01:15.239]  I'm proud of it.
[01:01:16.193 --> 01:01:19.915]  And I wanted to say something that was coincidental.
[01:01:19.915 --> 01:01:26.939]  You had mentioned on one of the videos that on 33rd and Liberty is where they started that cannon.
[01:01:26.939 --> 01:01:29.221]  I thought that was interesting.
[01:01:29.221 --> 01:01:30.221]  Started the cannon?
[01:01:30.221 --> 01:01:30.842]  Fill me in.
[01:01:30.842 --> 01:01:33.703]  The sonic wave cannon?
[01:01:33.703 --> 01:01:40.207]  They started their assault on our liberty on Liberty and 33rd with that numerology you were talking about.
[01:01:40.207 --> 01:01:41.168]  Yeah, you're talking about at the G20.
[01:01:42.358 --> 01:01:43.799]  Right, right.
[01:01:43.799 --> 01:01:57.964]  Now, I'm going to lead into Mexico, up to Mexico, but I want to say, too, that my wife was questioning me, and I was like, you have so much information, and I would like to know the percentage.
[01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:08.069]  I know that, like, 20% were loyalists in the revolution, and so we had some French here and some neutrals, and you had said 5%.
[01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:10.149]  Where can I find that information?
[01:02:10.149 --> 01:02:11.190]  Find what information?
[01:02:12.675 --> 01:02:18.459]  On how many actually were fighting in the revolution.
[01:02:18.459 --> 01:02:20.821]  For Texas?
[01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:24.083]  No, no, for the colonies back in 1776.
[01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:31.068]  Yeah, I'm sorry, my line to you was breaking up when you asked the question, so ask it again.
[01:02:31.068 --> 01:02:32.829]  Okay.
[01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:40.835]  My question is the amount, the percentage of people that were in the Revolutionary War for our side.
[01:02:42.432 --> 01:02:43.974]  Oh, it's in a lot of history books.
[01:02:43.974 --> 01:02:45.255]  They debate the numbers.
[01:02:45.255 --> 01:02:48.858]  Something like 1 or 2 percent got things started.
[01:02:48.858 --> 01:02:56.205]  About 3 to 4 percent, depending on what historical text you look at, were involved in the early stages of the war once it began in 1775.
[01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.467]  It really began in 1775, not July 4th, 1776.
[01:02:57.467 --> 01:02:58.187]  That was the unanimous declaration.
[01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:15.820]  Uh, and then, by the end, maybe 6, 7, 8 percent, uh, but I don't have those historical texts in front of me, but it's, it's, it's widely accepted historical fact and is in, uh, the, uh, reports of the time.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:19.922]  It's in the British dispatches, uh, what the British were estimating.
[01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:26.366]  Most people were neutral, and then around 20 percent were Tories or loyal to the Crown.
[01:03:26.366 --> 01:03:32.610]  Uh, so basically, to simplify it, 5 percent beat the 20 percent that supported the Crown.
[01:03:34.085 --> 01:03:34.906]  Thank you.
[01:03:34.906 --> 01:03:37.208]  And then I have one more comment.
[01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:42.613]  We ought to have volunteers to start piling up rocks on the border.
[01:03:42.613 --> 01:03:44.995]  And pile them so high that it'd be hard to get across.
[01:03:46.035 --> 01:03:53.840]  Well you know it's a 2,000 plus mile border and there's a lot of private property issues and I mean can you imagine trying to haul in the rocks for that?
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.642]  People would just remove the rocks and climb over.
[01:03:56.642 --> 01:04:10.052]  We need to put pressure on the Mexican government that's collapsed to stop using the United States as a steam valve and plus sending in masses of people from Mexico who then send their money back to Mexico that basically supports the corrupt government.
[01:04:10.532 --> 01:04:12.053]  And we need to cut off all the U.S.
[01:04:12.053 --> 01:04:17.837]  aid to Mexico, the tens of billions of dollars a year of taxpayer money that's going into that country.
[01:04:17.837 --> 01:04:26.523]  But is it anger you to see the Mexican president up here invoking and calling on 30 million illegals as his political weapon inside our nation?
[01:04:26.523 --> 01:04:29.045]  I mean, that's a military attack.
[01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:29.385]  Right.
[01:04:29.385 --> 01:04:36.410]  I mean, it's righteous anger, I believe, because I believe in God and our country was founded under God.
[01:04:37.416 --> 01:04:53.466]  And the guys that I believe are in charge here, I mean, I was just listening to a link that you had that was talking, the man with the tattoo on his neck, and what's amazing is that they're practicing Baal worship, and I knew about the Moloch stuff.
[01:04:53.466 --> 01:04:54.527]  Well, we're out of time.
[01:04:54.527 --> 01:04:55.967]  We're out of time for this segment.
[01:04:55.967 --> 01:04:57.909]  We'll come back with more of your phone calls.
[01:04:57.909 --> 01:04:58.329]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.902 --> 01:05:03.905]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:03.905 --> 01:05:09.232]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.232 --> 01:05:11.294]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.294 --> 01:05:16.300]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.481]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:18.202]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.464]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.464 --> 01:05:21.546]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.546 --> 01:05:23.748]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:23.748 --> 01:05:25.090]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:26.611]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.611 --> 01:05:31.898]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:31.898 --> 01:05:35.482]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.482 --> 01:05:38.946]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.286 --> 01:05:40.507]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.507 --> 01:05:41.408]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.408 --> 01:05:42.510]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:43.451]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:44.532]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.532 --> 01:05:47.595]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:47.595 --> 01:05:49.357]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:49.357 --> 01:05:50.298]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:59.983 --> 01:06:04.946]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:04.946 --> 01:06:05.947]  What have we got?
[01:06:05.947 --> 01:06:08.388]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:06:08.388 --> 01:06:09.389]  A republic.
[01:06:09.389 --> 01:06:12.030]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:14.312]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:06:14.312 --> 01:06:16.333]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:18.014]  So they think they own our land?
[01:06:18.014 --> 01:06:19.335]  They think they own our water?
[01:06:19.335 --> 01:06:19.935]  Children?
[01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:21.056]  Our education?
[01:06:21.056 --> 01:06:21.897]  Our money?
[01:06:21.897 --> 01:06:25.539]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:30.886]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:31.907]  We have the facts.
[01:06:31.907 --> 01:06:33.069]  We have the Constitution.
[01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.970]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:34.851]  We have common law.
[01:06:34.851 --> 01:06:37.375]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:41.160]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:46.225]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:06:46.225 --> 01:06:47.707]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:06:47.707 --> 01:06:48.808]  Don't tread on me.
[01:06:48.808 --> 01:06:55.675]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:06:59.793 --> 01:07:03.995]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:07:03.995 --> 01:07:10.397]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:10.397 --> 01:07:17.780]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:22.661]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:07:22.661 --> 01:07:24.782]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:07:27.603 --> 01:07:31.348]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:33.650]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.971]  Call us!
[01:07:47.126 --> 01:07:55.668]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:55.668 --> 01:07:58.249]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.947 --> 01:08:18.370]  All right, let me do a big news blitz right now.
[01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:21.854]  This is out of KTVU Television.
[01:08:21.854 --> 01:08:24.837]  I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to get more into it now.
[01:08:24.837 --> 01:08:29.662]  UC Berkeley asking incoming students for DNA.
[01:08:29.662 --> 01:08:37.311]  Now, you see an article like this by itself, and it's already very serious, but when you know Bill Clinton signed an executive order,
[01:08:39.195 --> 01:08:52.967]  Back in 1994, that we cover in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, where they said that in the future, it's on the books, they're just not enforcing it, you will give a DNA sample to get a driver's license.
[01:08:52.967 --> 01:09:01.274]  And then of course it's now mainstream news that for almost 40 years, 38 years and counting, all over the western world, part of a UN secret program,
[01:09:02.134 --> 01:09:05.980]  That's how secretive and corrupt and out of control the government is.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:13.773]  Blood has been taken from babies and put in a UN slash DNA IBM Pentagon database system.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.781]  And that, of course, is now mainstream news.
[01:09:17.781 --> 01:09:24.363]  People just a few months ago were shocked calling me en masse and emailing me saying, I thought you were lying all those years about this.
[01:09:24.363 --> 01:09:27.124]  I mean, we were posting the government documents.
[01:09:27.124 --> 01:09:28.905]  I was having congressmen on about it.
[01:09:28.905 --> 01:09:31.286]  I was having lawmakers from Australia on.
[01:09:31.286 --> 01:09:33.206]  I mean, this is worldwide.
[01:09:33.206 --> 01:09:34.467]  We don't make things up.
[01:09:37.267 --> 01:09:40.453]  Well now if you want to go to college, you're going to have to give DNA.
[01:09:40.453 --> 01:09:47.766]  And all over the country in the last three years, the feds are paying with federal grants for warrantless checkpoints where they take your blood.
[01:09:48.581 --> 01:09:51.263]  That's another key article Curt Nemos got up.
[01:09:51.263 --> 01:09:54.106]  Prison time for pot smoking.
[01:09:54.106 --> 01:10:12.320]  And the new federal guidelines to the states say if they want federal law enforcement money, they need to do blood tests on people they pull over, and marijuana stays in your system at least 30 days, and if any THC is found, let's say you smoked a joint 30 days before, you are going to prison for the equivalent of a DWI.
[01:10:13.317 --> 01:10:13.999]  That's in my stack.
[01:10:13.999 --> 01:10:20.037]  I'm going to cover that more coming up when the Love Police join us in the next hour.
[01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:26.943]  But, UC Berkeley asking incoming students for DNA.
[01:10:26.943 --> 01:10:31.286]  UC Berkeley is adding something a little different this year to its welcome package.
[01:10:31.286 --> 01:10:34.387]  Cotton swabs for a DNA sample out of your cheek.
[01:10:34.387 --> 01:10:39.529]  In the past, incoming freshmen and transfer students have received a rather typical welcome book.
[01:10:39.529 --> 01:10:41.991]  Yeah, a bunch of deadly vaccine shots.
[01:10:41.991 --> 01:10:44.412]  College of Letters and Science on the same page.
[01:10:44.412 --> 01:10:46.873]  But, this year the students will be asked for more.
[01:10:49.258 --> 01:10:51.939]  And then it goes on from there.
[01:10:51.939 --> 01:10:57.220]  And that integrates in with this article out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:00.741]  Apple won't take iPad buyers' cash.
[01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:05.502]  Doesn't matter if it's registered with AT&T, with your name and driver's license.
[01:11:05.502 --> 01:11:07.382]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:07.382 --> 01:11:09.403]  You cannot pay with cash.
[01:11:09.403 --> 01:11:15.464]  So we see all over the world cash being phased out for the cashless society surveillance grid.
[01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:23.737]  Designed to track and control every facet of your life.
[01:11:23.737 --> 01:11:31.141]  Apple wants your money, just not the paper kind, as one Bay Area woman discovered recently while trying to buy an iPad.
[01:11:31.141 --> 01:11:38.845]  Diane Campbell, who is disabled on a fixed income, saved up enough cash for an iPad, according to ABC7 Consumer Report, Michael Finney.
[01:11:39.952 --> 01:11:50.637]  She was about to plunk down 600 greenbacks at the Palo Alto store for a new tablet computer when she was reportedly told the store would not accept cash.
[01:11:50.637 --> 01:11:57.800]  Stunned, she walked away, iPad-less, with the backpack full of cash.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.881]  And again, this is, you're all criminals!
[01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:05.064]  Now, under, and this is globally happening, simultaneously, it's concerted, orchestrated,
[01:12:06.809 --> 01:12:11.153]  All over the world, they are expanding the Know Your Customer.
[01:12:11.153 --> 01:12:14.555]  And that's in this new, quote, bank re-regulation.
[01:12:14.555 --> 01:12:15.556]  We're going to get Wall Street.
[01:12:15.556 --> 01:12:17.518]  We're going to give them even more power.
[01:12:17.518 --> 01:12:18.018]  More money.
[01:12:18.018 --> 01:12:19.459]  Like, we're going to get the insurance companies.
[01:12:19.459 --> 01:12:24.844]  We're going to have them write a bill to make you buy overpriced insurance from them, and they can decide what care you get and cut costs.
[01:12:24.844 --> 01:12:27.166]  And we're going to cut Medicare by 20 plus percent.
[01:12:27.166 --> 01:12:30.809]  Yes, that will... We're going to raise your taxes and cut the funding.
[01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:35.051]  But I'm already digressing.
[01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:39.196]  The point is, they want to track everything you're doing.
[01:12:39.196 --> 01:12:55.494]  And in the new legislation, every purchase, every credit card purchase, everything you do online with online banking, everything you purchase, the government, live time, in your bank account, and they're going to phase out the cash, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:57.349 --> 01:13:01.810]  They are going to phase out the cash for the little people.
[01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:07.712]  Banks will still deal in it for their money laundering operations, but that'll all be selectively enforced.
[01:13:07.712 --> 01:13:13.174]  And that's why they want to shut down online swap meets and barter systems.
[01:13:13.174 --> 01:13:21.297]  That's why the feds, without even passing a law last year, changed the regulations, talking about million dollar fines for your garage sale.
[01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:25.858]  If you don't get a license or pay your taxes, and all these new enforcers out there,
[01:13:26.521 --> 01:13:29.058]  Chasing people around, controlling.
[01:13:31.559 --> 01:13:35.061]  Every facet of their lives, the animal ID, the premises ID.
[01:13:35.061 --> 01:13:44.985]  I see articles every two or three days where they're setting up police checkpoints and running stings against people selling raw milk or farm fresh eggs.
[01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:53.689]  People are being raided for tax reasons or permit reasons, selling watermelons and squash and peaches on the side of the road.
[01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:55.570]  You live in a prison.
[01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:57.891]  America is a giant prison.
[01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:03.449]  So of course the system is upset.
[01:14:03.449 --> 01:14:04.149]  Of course.
[01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:07.152]  And they know the American people are upset.
[01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:09.133]  But they've almost got their control grid in place.
[01:14:09.133 --> 01:14:11.095]  They've almost got the North American Union in place.
[01:14:11.095 --> 01:14:15.498]  They've almost got their war with Iran being a done deal.
[01:14:15.498 --> 01:14:17.880]  And they're so close to it right now.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.202]  And they're so excited about it.
[01:14:22.023 --> 01:14:32.028]  The pressure against them is mounting faster than they thought it would, and that's why President Brzezinski panicked in that CFR televised speech and said, look, the whole world's awake to us.
[01:14:32.028 --> 01:14:34.909]  Our world government's in trouble.
[01:14:34.909 --> 01:14:36.290]  Because it is in trouble.
[01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:39.052]  And so they're trying to hide everything in plain view.
[01:14:39.052 --> 01:14:43.894]  That's why they come out and say, yeah, we're taking your baby's blood at birth for a secret database.
[01:14:43.894 --> 01:14:47.436]  Yeah, we're watching your kids at home with government-issued laptops.
[01:14:47.436 --> 01:14:49.577]  Yeah, we're training your kids to spy on you.
[01:14:51.823 --> 01:14:54.319]  Yeah, we're growing the opium in Afghanistan.
[01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:57.391]  On and on and on.
[01:14:57.391 --> 01:14:59.552]  They just come right out in the open now.
[01:14:59.552 --> 01:15:01.393]  Yeah, we're setting up a world government.
[01:15:01.393 --> 01:15:08.756]  Yeah, Google does work for the NSA and was set up by the CIA, NSA, and NASA of all groups.
[01:15:08.756 --> 01:15:19.221]  And the entire operating system is, you know, the basic search function is just an NSA keyword search system developed 35 years ago and upgraded.
[01:15:19.221 --> 01:15:23.023]  And yeah, those mobile trucks, they are NSA Google contractors.
[01:15:23.843 --> 01:15:24.263]  I don't know.
[01:15:44.065 --> 01:15:53.070]  See how five years ago Paul Watson wrote the articles off a Google press release where they admittedly are watching you in your home right now with a computer.
[01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:58.013]  The computer recognizes a dog barking and then you get ads for dog food.
[01:15:58.013 --> 01:15:59.474]  That's how they fund the tyranny.
[01:15:59.474 --> 01:16:00.875]  But that's only secondary.
[01:16:02.466 --> 01:16:04.488]  They always fund their control grid.
[01:16:04.488 --> 01:16:10.773]  What, eight years ago, USA Today reported scoffclaws get nabbed ordering pizzas.
[01:16:10.773 --> 01:16:14.976]  It talks about how the big pizza companies have a private company.
[01:16:14.976 --> 01:16:27.086]  They get 25% of the fines and fees knowing that when you call with a real credit card, or with your real name and address, then it goes into a database, guilty until proven innocent, tracking everywhere you are, everything you're doing, slaves.
[01:16:29.721 --> 01:16:32.843]  And they're upset by Ron Paul and Rand Paul and others.
[01:16:32.843 --> 01:16:40.428]  They're upset that Specter's been thrown out in the primary and that other establishment people are losing in Utah and everywhere else.
[01:16:40.428 --> 01:16:42.390]  And that's why they have this headline.
[01:16:44.707 --> 01:16:48.829]  Conspiracist Alex Jones ran Paul is awesome.
[01:16:48.829 --> 01:16:52.691]  Now I noticed this article this morning just said Alex Jones ran Paul is awesome.
[01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:53.972]  They've added conspiracist.
[01:16:53.972 --> 01:16:59.115]  I guess the article wasn't vicious enough for them.
[01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:05.217]  And I talked to this guy for about 20 minutes yesterday and he said, I'm doing an article about FEMA camps in two weeks.
[01:17:05.217 --> 01:17:06.498]  I want the proof.
[01:17:06.498 --> 01:17:08.238]  And I laid it all out.
[01:17:08.238 --> 01:17:10.920]  How all of America is a giant tracking grid.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.520]  How schools are basically prisons.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.161]  How we have the biggest prison population in the world.
[01:17:15.161 --> 01:17:16.562]  Four and a half million behind bars.
[01:17:16.562 --> 01:17:19.543]  Another three to four million in the criminal justice system.
[01:17:19.543 --> 01:17:23.645]  How they had top off one and top off two and other drills where they practiced locking
[01:17:23.945 --> 01:17:24.265]  I think so.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.561]  What was the other big issue?
[01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:53.088]  The Emergency Centers Act with permanent military-based FEMA camps for during emergencies and for political dissidents.
[01:17:53.088 --> 01:17:54.390]  I mean, this is all out in the open.
[01:17:56.107 --> 01:17:57.507]  And there's none of that in the article.
[01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.328]  It's all about Rand Paul.
[01:17:59.328 --> 01:18:06.529]  Now, maybe he is doing an article in two weeks, and this is a separate Rand Paul article, but he told me, no, this is an article for two weeks from now.
[01:18:06.529 --> 01:18:10.030]  And he kept asking me, does Rand Paul believe in the FEMA camps?
[01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:16.571]  And I said, well, Rand Paul knows that big government always oppresses the people, and that tyranny happens 99% of the time in history.
[01:18:16.571 --> 01:18:19.751]  Can you deny that, Mark Benjamin?
[01:18:19.751 --> 01:18:22.192]  And Mr. Benjamin said, no, I really can't deny that.
[01:18:24.605 --> 01:18:26.767]  He didn't write that mean of an article, I've got to say.
[01:18:26.767 --> 01:18:31.554]  I guess that's why they changed his headline this morning to make it sound a little more vicious.
[01:18:31.554 --> 01:18:37.662]  But conspiracist Alex Jones ran Paul is awesome!
[01:18:38.993 --> 01:18:43.776]  So they got TV ads running in Kentucky, like, he goes on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:18:43.776 --> 01:18:44.937]  Look at that!
[01:18:44.937 --> 01:18:46.278]  He does radio interviews!
[01:18:46.278 --> 01:18:50.360]  Well, does that mean if he goes on CNN, he agrees with everything CNN says?
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:58.246]  Alex Jones, the radio host, who is closely identified with the Patriot movement, is thrilled with Rand Paul's Republican primary victory in Kentucky.
[01:18:58.826 --> 01:19:02.407]  Rand Paul is awesome, Jones told me in a telephone interview from Austin Wednesday.
[01:19:02.407 --> 01:19:03.727]  He is a constitutionalist.
[01:19:03.727 --> 01:19:08.028]  He is against the Patriot Act and the Iraq War and what's happening in Afghanistan.
[01:19:08.028 --> 01:19:13.850]  In Tuesday's primary, Paul crushed his GOP foe.
[01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:16.290]  Yeah, I saw Paul on CBS this morning.
[01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:18.631]  He said, we almost got 30-point lead on him.
[01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:20.731]  Well, the numbers I saw was 33.
[01:19:20.731 --> 01:19:25.358]  That was the exit polls I saw, but whatever.
[01:19:25.358 --> 01:19:32.828]  In Tuesday's primary, Paul crushed his GOP foe, Trey Grayson, even though Grayson had been favored by the party's establishment.
[01:19:32.828 --> 01:19:36.092]  When we come back, I'm going to finish this article because it's very important.
[01:19:38.646 --> 01:19:42.448]  To analyze it and also go over my statements on the other side.
[01:19:42.448 --> 01:19:43.889]  And then Wayne Madsen's joining us.
[01:19:43.889 --> 01:19:51.955]  Then the founder of the Love Police, another great political activist organization shattering the controlled left-right paradigm from England.
[01:19:51.955 --> 01:19:53.956]  Then we've got a financial writer coming on.
[01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:58.118]  He's written a book about how to take our financial system back with state banks.
[01:19:58.118 --> 01:19:58.559]  Stay with us.

[01:21:00.717 --> 01:21:03.679]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:21:03.679 --> 01:21:07.821]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:10.102]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:21:10.102 --> 01:21:15.265]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:21:15.265 --> 01:21:17.086]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:21:17.086 --> 01:21:18.387]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:21:18.627 --> 01:21:20.109]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:23.492]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:21:23.492 --> 01:21:28.857]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:21:28.857 --> 01:21:37.966]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[01:22:05.713 --> 01:22:08.458]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:22:08.458 --> 01:22:12.924]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:22:13.823 --> 01:22:18.304]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[01:22:34.547 --> 01:22:36.408]  This film needs to be seen.

[01:22:51.531 --> 01:22:54.795]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.041]  The problem.
[01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:04.623]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:23:04.623 --> 01:23:07.346]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:23:07.346 --> 01:23:10.009]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[01:23:10.009 --> 01:23:12.511]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:23:12.511 --> 01:23:21.520]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.381]  KaroStove has been
[01:23:22.381 --> 01:23:22.621]  I think so.
[01:23:38.662 --> 01:23:41.603]  Call 888-395-1164 today.

[01:23:56.150 --> 01:23:59.251]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[01:24:04.076 --> 01:24:15.742]  Coming up, an important article at InfoWars.com, a Jenna 21 alert, Immigration Theater, breaking down what's really behind the open borders.
[01:24:15.742 --> 01:24:22.066]  Going back to this article, Alex Jones, Ram Paul is Awesome Salon, big publication.
[01:24:23.826 --> 01:24:30.331]  I said, if you're an establishment Republican or Democrat, you are gone come November, Jones said.
[01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:38.657]  The good news is that people are coming in from both parties who have much better track records and don't have these establishment pedigrees.
[01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:42.780]  He also warned the media against smearing Paul.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:47.103]  And, you know, the full quote was basically, look, you guys don't understand.
[01:24:47.103 --> 01:24:48.825]  The people don't trust you anymore.
[01:24:48.825 --> 01:24:52.888]  So when you attack somebody, that actually makes people support them more.
[01:24:54.158 --> 01:24:59.565]  But the quote he excised is, he also warned the media against smearing Paul.
[01:24:59.565 --> 01:25:01.848]  The mainstream media doesn't understand.
[01:25:01.848 --> 01:25:03.290]  They are out of bullets.
[01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:07.756]  When the mainstream media wants to hurt Rand Paul, they should come out and endorse him.
[01:25:07.756 --> 01:25:08.738]  Which of course they won't do.
[01:25:09.778 --> 01:25:12.459]  So I was mainly mocking the fellow.
[01:25:12.459 --> 01:25:15.781]  Not in a mean way, just explaining to him the way things are.
[01:25:15.781 --> 01:25:16.641]  And I went on.
[01:25:16.641 --> 01:25:20.543]  When the establishment attacks someone, it only empowers them.
[01:25:20.543 --> 01:25:26.025]  Paul has appeared on Jones' show, and the host has promoted his candidacy.
[01:25:26.025 --> 01:25:38.871]  Jones, a fiery orator who pledges unyielding fealty to the Constitution, is riding a wave of neo-militant populism sparked by perceived, oh perceived, big government excesses.
[01:25:40.092 --> 01:25:44.036]  Oh, no, they're just talking about arresting citizens for no reason and disappearing into a black hole.
[01:25:44.036 --> 01:25:45.657]  They're talking about the end of free speech.
[01:25:45.657 --> 01:25:48.700]  Obama spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.722]  No, it's perceived.
[01:25:50.722 --> 01:26:01.872]  Even among his ideological kin, however, Jones nurtures a perhaps overly active predilection for conspiracies, particularly on the subject of 9-11.
[01:26:01.872 --> 01:26:04.414]  Like 6 of the 10 commissioners saying it's a fraud and a cover-up.
[01:26:04.414 --> 01:26:04.954]  You mean like that?
[01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:17.177]  On a recent segment of his radio show, Jones declared, this nation is being criminally and unconstitutionally absorbed by private central banks that are looting every major country on the planet.
[01:26:17.177 --> 01:26:23.419]  They will destroy borders, destroy constitutions that protect private property and the right of self-defense.
[01:26:23.419 --> 01:26:25.840]  This is the stated goal.
[01:26:27.028 --> 01:26:28.949]  Jones believes the U.S.
[01:26:28.949 --> 01:26:38.534]  government is involved in a decades-long conspiracy to imprison political dissenters in concentration camps that will be run by FEMA.
[01:26:38.534 --> 01:26:39.175]  I don't believe.
[01:26:39.175 --> 01:26:47.859]  I pointed him directly to the Miami Herald and the hearings on the FEMA camps for political dissidents.
[01:26:47.859 --> 01:26:48.500]  He told me
[01:26:49.690 --> 01:26:53.373]  That he's never talked about FEMA camps with Paul, that I can remember.
[01:26:53.373 --> 01:26:55.575]  I know they are concerned about the police state.
[01:26:55.575 --> 01:27:01.040]  I know that they are concerned about so many of our liberties being lost, he said of Paul's campaign.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:06.205]  They know that if you have a big, powerful government, it always turns towards oppression.
[01:27:06.205 --> 01:27:14.233]  But overall, a pretty fair article compared to what we usually see from the likes of Salon.
[01:27:16.414 --> 01:27:20.298]  But I did offer to send the guy all the documents, but he seemed to be aware of it.
[01:27:20.298 --> 01:27:32.271]  He knew about the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, he knew about the Emergency Centers Act, he knew about the hearings in the 80s about Rex 84, he knew about the violent belligerence act, he knew about
[01:27:35.219 --> 01:27:40.765]  The Houston Chronicle and others reporting on the Halliburton contracts for FEMA camps for political dissenters.
[01:27:40.765 --> 01:27:48.432]  I mean, but he still said Alex claims, or Alex thinks, or Alex... No, I don't think anything.
[01:27:48.432 --> 01:27:48.693]  Okay?
[01:27:48.693 --> 01:27:50.174]  I'm stating facts here.
[01:27:50.174 --> 01:27:55.360]  If I get up here on air and tell you sodium fluoride doubles your chances of bone cancer, there's over a hundred studies.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.562]  When I say a hundred, I'm just throwing a number out.
[01:27:57.562 --> 01:27:58.002]  It's gotta be...
[01:27:59.123 --> 01:27:59.423]  500.
[01:27:59.423 --> 01:28:02.044]  I mean, they've had these studies since the 30s.
[01:28:02.044 --> 01:28:07.105]  I mean, there's just so many studies on bone cancer doubling.
[01:28:07.105 --> 01:28:10.186]  It's even higher in men for some reason, but overall a doubling.
[01:28:10.186 --> 01:28:11.527]  And that's just one of the health effects.
[01:28:11.527 --> 01:28:19.549]  I mean, the stinking bags of the fluoride they put in your water supply say deadly poison on it, causes cancer, attacks all the organs.
[01:28:19.549 --> 01:28:24.270]  I mean, I'm reading the stinking bag, okay?
[01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:26.091]  Oh, it just, it's so frustrating.
[01:28:27.421 --> 01:28:28.482]  But I shouldn't be frustrated.
[01:28:28.482 --> 01:28:34.628]  People now know that, you know, if I say the earth is round, the media is going to call it a conspiracy theory.
[01:28:34.628 --> 01:28:36.970]  It is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:40.173]  It is fact, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:40.173 --> 01:28:43.676]  It is a fact what is going on in this society.
[01:28:46.274 --> 01:28:47.394]  Look at this news.
[01:28:47.394 --> 01:28:52.256]  Markets plunge for third day on jitters over EU economy.
[01:28:52.256 --> 01:29:00.080]  Global stocks plunge for the third day in a row on growing fears that Europe's financial crisis will hurt economic growth and lead to a wider market correction.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:08.323]  I'm concerned the markets are really out of control, German finance minister Wolfgang Schnabel, am I pronouncing that right, told Financial Times of London.
[01:29:09.073 --> 01:29:15.958]  This is why we need really effective regulation in the sense of creating a properly functioning market mechanism.
[01:29:15.958 --> 01:29:18.359]  And Tarpley agrees with what Germany is doing.
[01:29:18.359 --> 01:29:30.688]  They've put emergency controls on derivatives and on naked shorting because the big brokerage firms and banks, the recipients of the bailout money from the crises they create, are openly looting
[01:29:31.792 --> 01:29:33.153]  The market's right now.
[01:29:33.153 --> 01:29:41.838]  They're openly in there trying to exacerbate this to consolidate power and reap giant, giant rewards.
[01:29:41.838 --> 01:29:42.658]  Here's another headline.
[01:29:42.658 --> 01:29:46.080]  Woman's home confiscated over unpaid water bill.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:51.083]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:51.083 --> 01:29:52.464]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.464 --> 01:29:54.986]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.986 --> 01:29:57.687]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.670 --> 01:30:10.155]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:21.042]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:30:21.042 --> 01:30:26.466]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:30:27.026 --> 01:30:31.909]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:30:31.909 --> 01:30:40.975]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:30:40.975 --> 01:30:51.102]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:30:51.102 --> 01:30:54.785]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:30:54.785 --> 01:30:55.805]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:01.631]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.631 --> 01:31:07.217]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.217 --> 01:31:12.242]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.242 --> 01:31:17.288]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:31:17.808 --> 01:31:23.032]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.032 --> 01:31:25.333]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:31:25.333 --> 01:31:30.136]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.136 --> 01:31:31.257]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:31.257 --> 01:31:34.319]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:34.319 --> 01:31:37.962]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:37.962 --> 01:31:41.144]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:31:41.144 --> 01:31:43.365]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:31:43.365 --> 01:31:44.286]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:47.928 --> 01:31:50.891]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:50.891 --> 01:31:56.996]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:56.996 --> 01:32:00.478]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:00.478 --> 01:32:07.124]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:07.124 --> 01:32:12.268]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.268 --> 01:32:14.250]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:16.345 --> 01:32:37.207]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[01:32:45.959 --> 01:32:52.582]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:32:57.644 --> 01:32:58.525]  Others don't.

[01:33:25.535 --> 01:33:31.199]  But before I go any further, I want to thank the sponsors that make this radio show and everything else we do possible.
[01:33:31.199 --> 01:33:33.680]  One of them is efoodsdirect.com.

[01:33:38.923 --> 01:33:39.163]  I think?
[01:33:59.287 --> 01:34:01.749]  Ahead of this depression, have storable food.
[01:34:01.749 --> 01:34:05.172]  And if you end up not needing it, you can eat your investment.
[01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:06.553]  It's high quality, tasty food.
[01:34:06.553 --> 01:34:08.814]  They've got a bunch of different important food lines.
[01:34:08.814 --> 01:34:09.675]  So just check it out.

[01:34:25.967 --> 01:34:27.449]  Made in America.
[01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:33.412]  You've heard their catchy jingle that everyone around the office sings.
[01:34:33.412 --> 01:34:42.016]  A lot of people have the show on, and I can walk from office to office during breaks, from room to room, and hear basically everyone singing the jingle.
[01:34:42.016 --> 01:34:43.957]  But they're made in America.
[01:34:43.957 --> 01:34:47.719]  They got motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, a whole bunch of other great stuff.
[01:34:47.719 --> 01:34:50.100]  You want to check them out at gussetclothing.com.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:52.742]  Gusset spells G-U-S-S-E-T.
[01:34:52.742 --> 01:34:53.842]  gussetclothing.com.
[01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:06.508]  And these things are double sewn in the crotch because that's where my jeans always seem to tear out when I pick up a box or something if they're Levi's made overseas.
[01:35:06.508 --> 01:35:07.650]  Gussetclothing.com
[01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:12.379]  They sew a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:35:12.379 --> 01:35:14.900]  Blue diamond gusset.
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.301]  Gussets got it.
[01:35:16.301 --> 01:35:17.081]  Others don't.
[01:35:17.081 --> 01:35:17.721]  All right.
[01:35:17.721 --> 01:35:21.403]  Now I'm going to start.
[01:35:21.403 --> 01:35:22.684]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:35:22.684 --> 01:35:25.485]  I was at my mother's house yesterday.
[01:35:25.485 --> 01:35:26.166]  I dropped by.
[01:35:26.166 --> 01:35:27.927]  I dropped my children off.
[01:35:27.927 --> 01:35:32.089]  I took my wife out to dinner and my mother had the rebroadcast on in the house.
[01:35:32.089 --> 01:35:35.851]  And as I walk in the door, she's singing the Blue Diamond Gusset song.
[01:35:35.851 --> 01:35:37.511]  OK, I'm going to shut up.
[01:35:37.511 --> 01:35:38.272]  It's just it's the most
[01:35:41.257 --> 01:35:43.319]  The most catchy jingle I've ever heard.
[01:35:43.319 --> 01:35:45.200]  I've got to say that.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:52.285]  Getting into more serious subjects, I want to get into his inside investigation on what's really happening with BP.
[01:35:52.285 --> 01:35:55.088]  Will you guys reprint me the Curt Nemo article?
[01:35:55.088 --> 01:36:04.295]  I know you did, but I can't find it, about CBS News reporting that BP contractors won't let people on public beaches to videotape the oil.
[01:36:05.035 --> 01:36:08.216]  This is an example of martial law and tyranny violating the press.
[01:36:08.216 --> 01:36:09.857]  This is Obama's open press.
[01:36:09.857 --> 01:36:10.697]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:36:10.697 --> 01:36:23.381]  We're going to talk about the major political realignment with Specter going down, Grayson, the Republican, going down to Rand Paul, other Republican and Democrat establishment people going down.
[01:36:23.381 --> 01:36:27.683]  The media has framed this as if the Tea Party movement is an anti-Democrat thing.
[01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:35.155]  But Rick Perry, Senator Cornyn and others were booed a year and a half ago here in Texas at tea parties.
[01:36:35.155 --> 01:36:37.597]  But the media has tried to make it a Republican issue.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:37:03.616]  uh... so that uh... so-called left feels like they're not part of the political debate so they automatically are basically given the role of being pro-establishment when we're all in this together uh... so this this clearly shows a realignment and the system is panicking and they're trying to use Rand Paul as the figurehead to destroy him but as i told Salon yesterday you are out of bullets in the mainstream media
[01:37:04.537 --> 01:37:09.701]  If you're an established Republican or Democrat, you are gone come November, Jones said.
[01:37:09.701 --> 01:37:17.306]  The good news is that people are coming in from both parties who have much better track records as constitutionalists and don't have these establishment pedigrees.
[01:37:17.306 --> 01:37:19.608]  He also warned the media against smearing Paul.
[01:37:19.608 --> 01:37:21.329]  The mainstream media doesn't understand.
[01:37:21.329 --> 01:37:22.430]  They are out of bullets.
[01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:26.553]  When the mainstream media wants to hurt Rand Paul, they should come out and endorse him.
[01:37:27.153 --> 01:37:30.474]  When the establishment attacks someone, it only empowers them.
[01:37:30.474 --> 01:37:35.276]  So we'll talk about that and what's happening in the markets with Wayne Madsen.
[01:37:35.276 --> 01:37:37.137]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:37:37.137 --> 01:37:39.798]  He's a D.C.-based investigative journalist, author, syndicated columnist.
[01:37:39.798 --> 01:37:48.361]  He's written for The Village Voice, The Progressive, Counterpunch, Online Journal, CorpWatch, Multinational Monitor, News Leader, The Times, The American Conservative.
[01:37:48.361 --> 01:37:52.603]  His columns have appeared in the Miami Herald, Houston Chronicle, Philadelphia Inquirer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[01:37:53.243 --> 01:38:00.490]  He wrote the Handbook of Personal Data Protection, a claim reference book on international data law, genocide and covert operations in Africa.
[01:38:00.490 --> 01:38:03.213]  It just goes on and on.
[01:38:03.213 --> 01:38:08.378]  He's a regular contributor to ABC, NBC, Russia Today, Al Jazeera, CNN.
[01:38:08.378 --> 01:38:10.801]  He's been invited to testify as a witness before the U.S.
[01:38:10.801 --> 01:38:11.902]  House of Representatives, the U.N.
[01:38:11.902 --> 01:38:12.662]  Criminal Tribunal,
[01:38:13.263 --> 01:38:20.026]  And of course he worked with the NSA and a bunch of other federal agencies, the Naval Data Automated Command Department of State.
[01:38:20.026 --> 01:38:24.468]  So we've got him on for the next 25 minutes to go over all these subjects.
[01:38:24.468 --> 01:38:26.269]  Wayne Madsen, what do you want to get into first?
[01:38:26.269 --> 01:38:30.611]  Of the subjects I've mentioned that you've been reporting on, what do you think is most important?
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:50.994]  Well, I normally cover Inside the Beltway, Alex, but actually this week I'm in Chicago because there's just a lot of stories about our current president and his, for lack of a better term, his cronies that have just gone unreported by the Chicago papers, which have basically been decimated.
[01:38:51.674 --> 01:38:52.995]  We're good to go.
[01:39:10.401 --> 01:39:14.206]  He said he can't get to a lot of these stories, so I'm going to give him a hand.
[01:39:14.206 --> 01:39:22.899]  In just a few days I've been here, all I can say is the person who's in the White House, who we all see, is not the person who is the President.
[01:39:22.899 --> 01:39:23.400]  Believe you me.
[01:39:24.281 --> 01:39:35.944]  Well, I mean, weathermen, corrupt poverty pimps, slumlords, mafia, break down your research of Barack Obama.
[01:39:35.944 --> 01:39:43.326]  I mean, if this has got you out of D.C., in Chicago, we know this is big news, what are you ferreting out on Obama?
[01:39:44.406 --> 01:39:49.208]  Well, let's just start with the Blagojevich trial.
[01:39:49.208 --> 01:39:59.712]  It's very clear that Blagojevich, like many of his predecessors as governors of Illinois, there's been many who have been indicted and many have gone to jail.
[01:39:59.712 --> 01:40:06.334]  Otto Kerner and Walker and even Blagojevich's predecessor, Republican George Ryan.
[01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:10.536]  But when we look at this case against Blagojevich, what we have is
[01:40:11.136 --> 01:40:13.358]  Patrick Fitzgerald, who's a dirty U.S.
[01:40:13.358 --> 01:40:26.807]  prosecuting attorney here in Illinois, cutting a deal with people like Rahm Emanuel and Obama, put the attention on... Blagojevich only concentrated on certain segments of
[01:40:27.948 --> 01:40:30.329]  Of wiretapped information.
[01:40:30.329 --> 01:40:34.231]  Don't listen to the other, you know, 500 hours of wiretapped.
[01:40:34.231 --> 01:40:42.855]  It would implicate Mr. Obama, Mr. Emanuel, and others, including Alex Giannullis, who's running for the U.S.
[01:40:42.855 --> 01:40:47.297]  Senate, Obama's good buddy, whose bank, Broadway Bank, failed.
[01:40:47.837 --> 01:40:51.659]  And Broadway Bank made one of the big loans, the initial loan to Resco.
[01:40:51.659 --> 01:41:03.506]  We know that Resco put up the money for Obama to buy this $500,000 home in Hyde Park near the University of Chicago, which is not a bad section, by the way, of the South Side.
[01:41:03.506 --> 01:41:13.332]  So what we have is Resco being indicted, Blagojevich being indicted, and it's very clear to me that those indictments should have also been served to Rahm Emanuel.
[01:41:13.792 --> 01:41:15.473]  You just made me have a double-take there.
[01:41:40.219 --> 01:41:45.743]  Did you say Rahm Emanuel and Obama, you believe, have been served secret indictments?
[01:41:45.743 --> 01:41:47.405]  No, they should be.
[01:41:47.405 --> 01:41:48.465]  They should be.
[01:41:48.465 --> 01:41:53.049]  But the concentration, of course, by Fitzgerald, who was kept on, Bush's U.S.
[01:41:53.049 --> 01:42:02.956]  attorney, has been on Boyavich, Resco, and, you know, the fair game, when in fact there should be, if we had a decent U.S.
[01:42:02.956 --> 01:42:03.617]  attorney here in
[01:42:04.498 --> 01:42:10.904]  In Northern Illinois, who was really interested in going after corruption, we would actually, if it was an honest U.S.
[01:42:10.904 --> 01:42:25.900]  attorney, we would have had indictments issued against Obama, Rahm Emanuel, and Valerie Jarrett, who was his policy advisor, and a number of the other cronies, probably including the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:30.842]  All these people who are Obama's friends and cronies.
[01:42:30.842 --> 01:42:39.765]  And I should add that one of them, of course, is Elena Kagan, who now has been nominated for the Supreme Court.
[01:42:39.765 --> 01:42:48.309]  Did they choose Obama not just because he's good looking and can read off a teleprompter well, but because he's so compromised with all of these mafia connections?
[01:42:49.013 --> 01:42:50.674]  Well, he's totally blackmailed.
[01:42:50.674 --> 01:42:53.017]  We can look at his history.
[01:42:53.017 --> 01:43:00.443]  You know, 10 years ago, Obama didn't have $10 in his pocket to put gas in his gas tank of his car.
[01:43:00.443 --> 01:43:02.925]  By the way, he had this car.
[01:43:02.925 --> 01:43:05.107]  It was sold on eBay.
[01:43:05.107 --> 01:43:08.510]  Apparently, it only had 22,000 miles on it.
[01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:16.497]  But even at 22,000 miles, apparently the tires were so beat up, I have to imagine this guy was peeling rubber on the streets of Chicago.
[01:43:18.598 --> 01:43:29.484]  Running around town, but, you know, here's a guy whose he and his wife were being harassed by creditors, credit card collection agencies, and, you know, they had three salaries.
[01:43:29.484 --> 01:43:36.929]  His is Illinois State Senator, his is a part-time professor at the University of Chicago, and her salary, and yet they couldn't make ends meet.
[01:43:36.929 --> 01:43:42.572]  I mean, if he couldn't pay his own bills then, maybe that's why he can't pay the country's bills today.
[01:43:44.244 --> 01:43:48.267]  Well, he's admitted to drug use, and there's a lot of evidence that he used a lot of hard drugs.
[01:43:48.267 --> 01:43:50.529]  Maybe that's why he didn't have money.
[01:43:50.529 --> 01:43:56.933]  Right, and also there are reports of other extracurricular activities he engaged in here.
[01:43:56.933 --> 01:44:07.441]  Well, Wayne, you've always got some of the best sources out there, and it would be a big blackmail tool, but I mean, is there credible evidence you're starting to run into that he is bisexual?
[01:44:08.932 --> 01:44:23.636]  Yes, and it's known here in Chicago, it's known among members of the African American community, and let's just say, I mean, where was the media?
[01:44:23.636 --> 01:44:32.638]  Unfortunately, the media, the Chicago media couldn't go very far on this because of what's happened to the, many of the reporters at the Chicago Tribune have been laid off because of this.
[01:44:33.059 --> 01:44:33.982]  We're good to go.
[01:44:40.347 --> 01:44:42.147]  Basically up for grabs.
[01:44:42.147 --> 01:44:45.608]  They've gone through a huge reduction in staff.
[01:44:45.608 --> 01:44:49.749]  So you're there on this story, shifting gears again.
[01:44:49.749 --> 01:44:52.249]  What's the word in Washington on Elena Kagan?
[01:44:52.249 --> 01:45:03.711]  Is she just somebody they're throwing out there with no judicial experience, who's anti-free speech, anti-Second Amendment, knowing that she'll just take all the fire and then who they really want will come in after her?
[01:45:03.711 --> 01:45:06.452]  Or do you think they're really this arrogant to try to put her in?
[01:45:07.205 --> 01:45:09.827]  No, because you see who they're lining up.
[01:45:09.827 --> 01:45:20.433]  They're lining up all the judicial experts and bar association cronies are all saying, oh, she's so wonderful.
[01:45:20.433 --> 01:45:21.554]  I think she's going to get in.
[01:45:21.554 --> 01:45:32.521]  But see, Lyndon Johnson put Abe Fortas on the court, but he had to finally step down because he got implicated in all kinds of scandals and crony deals.
[01:45:32.521 --> 01:45:35.883]  And she's involved with Goldman Sachs up to her eyebrows.
[01:45:36.684 --> 01:45:51.054]  Yeah, but see, they know that today you can't get rid of somebody on the court like they did eight quarters, because once they're now a unit, you could get them for evidence of being an ax murderer, and it would probably be impossible to get them off the court.
[01:45:52.546 --> 01:46:01.055]  Now, the media needs to go ahead and bring out the fact that she is a lesbian so that they can't use that against her for blackmail later.
[01:46:01.055 --> 01:46:04.819]  I mean, isn't it important for her to come out with her sexuality?
[01:46:04.819 --> 01:46:08.944]  I mean, how controlled is the media that only CBS News is reported on this?
[01:46:09.895 --> 01:46:17.137]  Yeah, I mean the media is totally controlled and you know the people in the legal community who are coming to her defense and praising her.
[01:46:17.137 --> 01:46:21.319]  Look, this is part of the whole inside the D.C.
[01:46:21.319 --> 01:46:22.059]  mentality.
[01:46:22.059 --> 01:46:25.080]  You scratch my back, I scratch yours.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:29.261]  And obviously this is what was going on here in Chicago with her here.
[01:46:32.963 --> 01:46:36.685]  She was associated with this city for many years, with the University of Chicago.
[01:46:36.685 --> 01:46:39.267]  She clerked for Abner McVin.
[01:46:39.267 --> 01:46:41.008]  You know, this U.S.
[01:46:41.008 --> 01:46:43.971]  judge, as far as they're concerned, here walks on water.
[01:46:43.971 --> 01:46:49.575]  So, you know, if he says she's good, you know, everybody falls into place.
[01:46:49.575 --> 01:46:52.277]  Okay, let's look at the economy.
[01:46:52.277 --> 01:46:59.242]  In free fall, markets down worldwide, the euro in danger of collapsing.
[01:46:59.242 --> 01:47:00.943]  What's your research on where this is going?
[01:47:02.059 --> 01:47:05.122]  Well, I think we're seeing a meltdown.
[01:47:05.122 --> 01:47:13.051]  Certainly, we saw what happened in Thailand, where there was a Tiananmen Square-style massacre.
[01:47:13.051 --> 01:47:19.438]  The farmers who came in were very upset about what's going on in that country, with more money going to the elite.
[01:47:20.218 --> 01:47:32.966]  My prediction there is that Thailand will now be engaged in a full-scale civil war with the Havnots going after the Havs, especially in the smaller cities and in the rural areas.
[01:47:32.966 --> 01:47:36.668]  Greece, they're marching on the parliament today.
[01:47:36.668 --> 01:47:38.329]  They, again, are trying to take it over.
[01:47:39.029 --> 01:47:46.112]  Uh, with the deals worked out with Spain and Portugal and there was an attempt to storm the Irish Parliament a few weeks ago.
[01:47:46.112 --> 01:47:56.796]  Uh, Iceland, uh, not, you know, the people there are not going to pay for the... I think people just had... Now we hear Sarkozy threatening to pull out of the Euro, Merkel banning, um...
[01:47:57.536 --> 01:47:59.558]  Naked short-selling in Germany.
[01:47:59.558 --> 01:48:03.321]  I think maybe some of these leaders are starting to hear the message.
[01:48:03.321 --> 01:48:05.843]  They should have heard it earlier on, but I think they're worried.
[01:48:05.843 --> 01:48:11.868]  I think the reason they're taking these actions is they're very worried about what they're seeing on the streets, you know?
[01:48:11.868 --> 01:48:15.351]  Shopping malls going up in flames in Bangkok.
[01:48:15.351 --> 01:48:17.232]  Banks being bombed in Athens.
[01:48:17.232 --> 01:48:22.196]  You know, people marching... Banks being bombed in Canada.
[01:48:22.196 --> 01:48:23.818]  Banks being firebombed in Canada.
[01:48:24.403 --> 01:48:25.523]  Right, right.
[01:48:25.523 --> 01:48:35.946]  And now we see the Gulf of Mexico turning into a dead zone, and I just wonder how long it's going to take for people to reach that level of frustration here.
[01:48:35.946 --> 01:48:49.450]  I would note that more people filed for unemployment last month than previously, so Obama's all his brouhaha about the unemployment coming down is merely rhetoric and not even true.
[01:48:50.762 --> 01:49:00.145]  Well, going back to domestic developments, and we're going to come back and talk about your research and the story you've got out about BP and the admitted cover up there.
[01:49:00.145 --> 01:49:04.286]  I mean, every day they admit it was worse than what they had originally said, and they knowingly lied.
[01:49:04.286 --> 01:49:11.708]  But Rand Paul winning the primary in Kentucky by 30-plus points, the Republican incumbent losing in the primary in Utah.
[01:49:12.548 --> 01:49:21.956]  Specter going down, Zbigniew Brzezinski coming out on video and saying, the world has never been this awake to our world government.
[01:49:21.956 --> 01:49:23.397]  We are in trouble.
[01:49:23.397 --> 01:49:24.418]  To the CFR.
[01:49:24.418 --> 01:49:26.520]  I mean, they are not invincible, are they?
[01:49:27.649 --> 01:49:38.673]  No, and I think what they're seeing, as I said, you know, when people are getting, you know, thousands, tens of thousands of people hit the streets, go on general strikes.
[01:49:38.673 --> 01:49:42.754]  We're seeing it all over Europe and Asia.
[01:49:42.754 --> 01:49:48.256]  We remember the food riots a few years ago popping up in places like Haiti and in Africa.
[01:49:48.256 --> 01:49:49.617]  We may see that happen again.
[01:49:50.357 --> 01:49:58.303]  Uh, but this is something where the have-nots, and there's increasingly more have-nots than there are the elite have.
[01:49:58.303 --> 01:50:00.305]  And I think, uh, I think they're worried.
[01:50:00.305 --> 01:50:02.306]  They have good reason to be worried.
[01:50:02.306 --> 01:50:07.310]  And now, again, the Gulf Coast being decimated, as it was.
[01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:08.951]  They were just coming back from Katrina.
[01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:11.613]  They would never get back to where they were.
[01:50:11.613 --> 01:50:13.474]  And now this happens, and we find out that, uh,
[01:50:14.735 --> 01:50:25.439]  The White House, the Coast Guard, Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security that controls the Coast Guard, are engaged in this massive cover-up and providing cover for BP.
[01:50:25.439 --> 01:50:26.780]  I have a story out today.
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:29.481]  BP expanded its refinery.
[01:50:30.001 --> 01:50:37.385]  Uh, down here on Lake Michigan in Hammond, Indiana, uh, they made promises to offset increased pollution in the lake.
[01:50:37.385 --> 01:50:45.070]  They would take certain steps to fund the mitigation, pollution mitigation, uh, on other, for other plants on Lake Michigan.
[01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:46.050]  They never did this.
[01:50:46.050 --> 01:50:53.855]  And they, and, and Lisa Jackson, who's Obama's EPA administration, uh, administrator, has done nothing to hold BP's feet to the fire.
[01:50:53.855 --> 01:50:56.356]  And what I'm told here is that what this
[01:50:56.676 --> 01:50:58.157]  Well, stay there, stay there, we got a break.
[01:50:58.157 --> 01:51:01.119]  Come back and tell us on the other side and a lot more with Wayne Madsen.
[01:51:01.119 --> 01:51:02.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:08.023]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.023 --> 01:51:13.046]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.046 --> 01:51:18.630]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:23.853]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.853 --> 01:51:25.714]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:26.144 --> 01:51:30.948]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.948 --> 01:51:32.069]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.069 --> 01:51:34.831]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.831 --> 01:51:38.754]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.754 --> 01:51:41.956]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.956 --> 01:51:44.178]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:45.279 --> 01:51:46.420]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:51:55.236 --> 01:51:57.797]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.797 --> 01:52:01.038]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:54:11.164 --> 01:54:13.846]  Okay, Wayne, you got cut off by that break.
[01:54:13.846 --> 01:54:16.929]  Wayne Manson and WayneMansonReport.com, investigative journalist.
[01:54:16.929 --> 01:54:21.334]  You were getting down to the bottom line with what's happening with BP.
[01:54:23.215 --> 01:54:28.799]  They've got this plant that they've expanded on Lake Michigan that's processing heavy Canadian crude.
[01:54:28.799 --> 01:54:37.064]  They have reneged on all the promises they made to the court when the environmental groups up here sued BP.
[01:54:37.064 --> 01:54:45.129]  The court, of course, like many, was found in their favor, but they promised they would do this mitigation to prevent
[01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:56.259]  There's increased pollution from having an effect on Lake Michigan, but what I'm told here is that this Hammond refinery is an accident waiting to happen.
[01:54:56.259 --> 01:55:06.149]  They have a record of safety violations, environmental violations, and that what's going on in the Gulf of Mexico today could easily happen to Lake Michigan.
[01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:11.034]  It'll affect not only the city of Chicago, but all the other
[01:55:11.574 --> 01:55:12.194]  We're good to go.
[01:55:33.121 --> 01:55:54.077]  BP was caught, well they were taking full page ads out in papers defending its position, defending the plant, defending its request for a permit to expand the plant, but it was also found out they were paying internet bloggers to go out and trash anybody who criticized this expansion of the plant, and I would note that that's going on right now.
[01:55:54.537 --> 01:55:55.618]  Well, that was my next point.
[01:55:55.618 --> 01:55:56.639]  Have you seen the CBS news piece?
[01:55:56.639 --> 01:55:57.240]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:56:14.815 --> 01:56:19.337]  I have, and this is no—because what I reported is the Coast Guard is part of the problem.
[01:56:19.337 --> 01:56:22.879]  You know, it's part of the Homeland Security Department under Napolitano.
[01:56:22.879 --> 01:56:39.208]  The Coast Guard is basically covering for BP on orders of Napolitano, but this is really irritating people that I'm hearing from with the Army Corps of Engineers, and believe it or not, FEMA comes out smelling like a rose here.
[01:56:39.568 --> 01:56:50.975]  FEMA's really upset that what they're seeing with NOAA and the Coast Guard and the EPA covering up for what they've seen as a huge disaster.
[01:56:50.975 --> 01:57:03.823]  Well, for those who just joined us, all over the Gulf Coast, if anybody tries to go up, including CBS News, with video cameras on public beaches to show the oil, armed men come up and say, get out of here.
[01:57:03.823 --> 01:57:05.444]  I mean, this is not America.
[01:57:05.444 --> 01:57:07.626]  And going back three years ago, a few years after Katrina,
[01:57:08.206 --> 01:57:11.431]  Greg Palast of the BBC was working for ABC on the story.
[01:57:11.431 --> 01:57:14.855]  He went and showed one of these FEMA facilities that was holding people.
[01:57:16.055 --> 01:57:31.786]  You know, in these trailers of these emergency communities, and Palast tried to videotape that was right next to a chemical dump, and they put out an arrest warrant for him that got retracted for terrorism, for violating national infrastructure security.
[01:57:31.786 --> 01:57:38.250]  So, if we're wondering where the government's going under the Patriot Act, they are using it to cover up real environmental problems.
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:49.362]  Hey, you know in that CBS video, that footage, the two Coast Guard guys tell CBS, the CBS crew, we're following BP rules here.
[01:57:49.362 --> 01:57:50.523]  We're under BP.
[01:57:50.523 --> 01:57:54.583]  Well, since when did the Coast Guard take orders from BP?
[01:57:54.583 --> 01:57:56.084]  I thought it was the other way around.
[01:57:56.084 --> 01:58:01.845]  So, I think this is further proof of what's happening with corporate fascism in this country.
[01:58:03.194 --> 01:58:03.974]  It's incredible.
[01:58:03.974 --> 01:58:12.499]  I mean, all over the nation, you'll try to videotape, you know, a police car from a hundred yards away and they'll come over and say, turn your camera off and arrest you.
[01:58:12.499 --> 01:58:15.901]  Or you try to show what BP's doing, you know, they threaten to arrest you.
[01:58:15.901 --> 01:58:18.402]  I mean, it's just no First Amendment.
[01:58:18.402 --> 01:58:19.263]  And then you got Kagan.
[01:58:20.003 --> 01:58:21.044]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:21.044 --> 01:58:22.104]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.657 --> 01:58:54.799]  We're subject to other police action.
[01:58:54.799 --> 01:58:56.060]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:59.784]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:59.784 --> 01:59:02.226]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.226 --> 01:59:08.111]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.111 --> 01:59:14.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.757 --> 01:59:20.741]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.741 --> 01:59:24.924]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:29.207]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.207 --> 01:59:35.152]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.152 --> 01:59:38.714]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.714 --> 01:59:40.695]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.695 --> 01:59:41.136]  It's here.

[01:59:56.068 --> 02:00:05.456]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.456 --> 02:00:06.757]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.757 --> 02:00:07.738]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.508 --> 02:00:10.269]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.269 --> 02:00:11.850]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.850 --> 02:00:13.410]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.410 --> 02:00:17.592]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.592 --> 02:00:23.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.255 --> 02:00:25.836]  Well, they're marching on the Capitol in Thailand.
[02:00:25.836 --> 02:00:27.657]  They're marching on the Capitol in Greece.
[02:00:31.328 --> 02:00:33.511]  Worldwide, the people are getting more and more angry.
[02:00:33.511 --> 02:00:39.300]  Incumbents are being thrown out in the primaries all across the United States, Democrats and Republicans.
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.823]  The people are waking up.
[02:00:40.823 --> 02:00:45.530]  Wayne Madsen, if you're going to be spending a lot of time in Chicago, I was asking you during the last break that you
[02:00:46.391 --> 02:00:48.272]  You know, could this be what unravels Obama?
[02:00:48.272 --> 02:00:50.953]  And you said, absolutely, that's why I'm here.
[02:00:50.953 --> 02:00:55.615]  And you were saying the conventional wisdom on the street is he's not going to be running for re-election.
[02:00:55.615 --> 02:01:00.638]  And we've even had Howard Dean coming out saying he may run and that they may run other Democrats against him.
[02:01:00.638 --> 02:01:03.239]  So the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[02:01:03.239 --> 02:01:07.381]  They built this guy up like it was the second coming of Christ.
[02:01:07.381 --> 02:01:11.983]  But boy, I tell you, he is crashing and burning.
[02:01:11.983 --> 02:01:13.184]  What's your take on that, Wayne?
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:18.822]  Well, Obama walked in in the last campaign without any kind of checks.
[02:01:18.822 --> 02:01:21.863]  He was a rock star.
[02:01:21.863 --> 02:01:26.045]  He glided in, and he didn't really take much in the way of any barbs.
[02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:27.646]  But this next time, he will.
[02:01:27.646 --> 02:01:29.706]  And Michelle knows that.
[02:01:29.706 --> 02:01:34.288]  They didn't have much money when he was in the Illinois State Senate.
[02:01:34.288 --> 02:01:36.049]  He's made all kinds of money now.
[02:01:36.049 --> 02:01:43.392]  And apparently, her thinking is, if they would leave, cut and run now, they could make more money as an ex-president.
[02:01:43.792 --> 02:01:48.934]  Now from your sources, is he bisexual or is the, what do they call that in Hollywood, is his wife and kids a beard?
[02:02:11.489 --> 02:02:16.775]  Uh, well it would be, the white would be a beard, absolutely would be a beard.
[02:02:16.775 --> 02:02:28.188]  Look, there's a big scandal here with the Republican candidate for Senate, Kirk, now being outed as part of this gay ring along with Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley.
[02:02:28.188 --> 02:02:31.292]  So, you know, it's in both parties in this state.
[02:02:32.193 --> 02:02:32.733]  Absolutely!
[02:02:32.733 --> 02:02:43.518]  I mean, I don't know anything against gay people, but why is it in Rome or anywhere else, when in the decline, it becomes like a guild, and the only people they're outing are the straights?
[02:02:43.518 --> 02:02:48.620]  Yeah, the problem with Kirk is he's apparently a Naval Reserve Officer, Navy Intelligence.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:53.342]  So here we go with not only the Don't Ask, Don't Tell issue, but also highly blackmailable.
[02:02:53.342 --> 02:02:57.724]  Now he wants to be the United States Senator, filling Obama's old seat from Illinois.
[02:03:00.777 --> 02:03:05.881]  So you predict curtains for Obama unless they launch an Iran war?
[02:03:05.881 --> 02:03:12.586]  Or what's your intel on how the establishment's going to try to finesse and finagle their way out of this?
[02:03:12.586 --> 02:03:26.217]  I think they could launch an Iran war and also, you know, say to Obama, you know, go ahead, go make a lot more money than Bill Clinton and we'll have another person we'll invest in, you know, bring in as the presidential candidate.
[02:03:26.690 --> 02:03:28.994]  And again, folks, Wayne Madsen doesn't just say things.
[02:03:28.994 --> 02:03:31.117]  He's one of our best sources of info.
[02:03:31.117 --> 02:03:36.786]  And this is just incredible coming from you, I guess, because you're there doing the research.
[02:03:36.786 --> 02:03:41.413]  Because if he is completely homosexual, my God, he is so blackmailed, isn't he?
[02:03:42.119 --> 02:03:42.820]  Right, he is.
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:04:06.820]  And remember, I supported Obama, but I put myself in the category of people that didn't do their job properly and investigate him, but the secrets were all here in Chicago, and there was just so many stories and so few people willing to dig deep on them, because as I mentioned, the Chicago newspapers have basically been destroyed.
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:09.543]  Well, you know, Bush was so bad, you would think
[02:04:10.638 --> 02:04:18.103]  Anything could be better and then it just gets worse and I think it's the establishment has committed so many crimes, why not commit a million more?
[02:04:18.103 --> 02:04:20.445]  Do you agree with me that all their chips are in though?
[02:04:20.445 --> 02:04:22.647]  I mean the establishment is going for broke.
[02:04:23.655 --> 02:04:30.637]  Well, I think that, you know, it's like a wild animal, when cornered or treed, that they lash out.
[02:04:30.637 --> 02:04:34.477]  And I think that's exactly what these people are capable of doing.
[02:04:34.477 --> 02:04:40.019]  We don't know, you know, they still have a lot of influence, they still have a lot of power.
[02:04:40.019 --> 02:04:51.321]  What they're capable of, and certainly starting a war would be something, they've opted for that in the past, they would opt for it again in the future, but I think maybe that people around the world are a little wise to their
[02:04:51.781 --> 02:04:52.421]  Absolutely.
[02:04:52.421 --> 02:04:53.862]  WayneMadsonReport.com.
[02:04:53.862 --> 02:04:54.842]  Wayne, thanks for coming on.
[02:04:54.842 --> 02:04:56.142]  God bless you.
[02:04:56.142 --> 02:04:56.482]  Okay.
[02:04:56.482 --> 02:05:01.283]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:05:01.283 --> 02:05:04.304]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.304 --> 02:05:09.625]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.625 --> 02:05:11.686]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.686 --> 02:05:16.667]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.667 --> 02:05:17.587]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.847 --> 02:05:18.968]  When do you want it?
[02:05:18.968 --> 02:05:20.869]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.869 --> 02:05:21.950]  When will you need it?
[02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:24.131]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.131 --> 02:05:25.472]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.472 --> 02:05:27.013]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.013 --> 02:05:32.277]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.277 --> 02:05:35.859]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.859 --> 02:05:39.322]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.

[02:07:02.328 --> 02:07:04.670]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:07:04.670 --> 02:07:07.873]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:07:07.873 --> 02:07:12.978]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:07:12.978 --> 02:07:17.502]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:07:17.502 --> 02:07:19.904]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:07:19.904 --> 02:07:22.406]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:07:22.406 --> 02:07:25.249]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:07:25.629 --> 02:07:33.250]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:07:33.570 --> 02:07:38.955]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:07:38.955 --> 02:07:41.818]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:07:41.818 --> 02:07:45.502]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:07:45.502 --> 02:07:46.583]  And I got news for you.
[02:07:46.583 --> 02:07:47.924]  You're everyone else.
[02:07:47.924 --> 02:07:49.425]  Invisible Empire.

[02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:09.034]  Ah, George Osborne, Bullingdon Club, William Hague, hello the elites, how are the Zionist elites this morning?
[02:08:09.034 --> 02:08:12.156]  Thank you for giving us the illusion of democracy.
[02:08:12.156 --> 02:08:15.338]  Do you want the puppet on the left or the puppet on the right?
[02:08:15.338 --> 02:08:19.721]  Yes, you guys go slightly crazy when you compromise personal morality for political gain.
[02:08:19.721 --> 02:08:22.183]  Hey, how was your time on the Rothschild's yacht?
[02:08:22.703 --> 02:08:25.425]  You like the Rothschilds more than you like normal people.
[02:08:25.425 --> 02:08:32.149]  George Osborne, isn't it great that you have a country of 70 million people where 7% control all the land?
[02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:34.131]  Are you related to the Queen, sir?
[02:08:34.131 --> 02:08:34.811]  Go home, Yank.
[02:08:34.811 --> 02:08:36.833]  Go home, Yank.
[02:08:36.833 --> 02:08:39.134]  Oh, some random racism by this gentleman here.
[02:08:39.134 --> 02:08:43.237]  Perhaps you'd like to vote for the BNP?
[02:08:43.237 --> 02:08:44.878]  William Hague, George Osborne.
[02:08:44.878 --> 02:08:45.638]  Hey!
[02:08:45.638 --> 02:08:48.600]  It must be difficult fellating Satan all day.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:51.863]  Hey, power and money from the nice teat of Satan.
[02:08:52.963 --> 02:08:57.007]  Sorry, I'm not even religious, but you guys are liars and murderers!
[02:08:57.007 --> 02:08:58.889]  Total liars and murderers!
[02:08:58.889 --> 02:09:01.371]  You should talk about America!
[02:09:01.371 --> 02:09:07.477]  I'm not even American, my friend, I'm Scottish, so F you!
[02:09:07.477 --> 02:09:10.600]  Even worse, get out to the UK!
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:16.263]  Perhaps you'd prefer if we joined the European Union, you little shill idiot!
[02:09:16.263 --> 02:09:21.385]  Yeah, liars!
[02:09:21.385 --> 02:09:22.325]  Hello, liars!
[02:09:22.325 --> 02:09:23.786]  Hey, big power and money!
[02:09:23.786 --> 02:09:28.288]  Politics, yeah!
[02:09:28.288 --> 02:09:32.430]  Well, it was about a year ago that we had Charlie Veitch on with us.
[02:09:34.318 --> 02:09:39.483]  And back then he had started the Love Police, kind of like We Are Change or InfoWars groups.
[02:09:39.483 --> 02:09:42.325]  It's like British Tea Party.
[02:09:42.325 --> 02:09:47.830]  And they just go out to public events and show the police state and confront globalists.
[02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:53.656]  There he was confronting the new British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and shutting down their press conference.
[02:09:56.129 --> 02:10:03.154]  And it's another example of the effect you can have by just confronting these people with the truth and the facts.
[02:10:03.154 --> 02:10:13.721]  They've been arrested for videotaping, they've been arrested for publicly speaking, they've been locked up by security guards, they've been harassed because England has become a police state.
[02:10:13.721 --> 02:10:21.326]  Two years ago they changed the law where you can't videotape in public or they arrest you as a terrorist, but the government's going to watch you and track what you're doing.
[02:10:22.066 --> 02:10:26.312]  And more and more the media, not just alternative media, is standing up and saying no.
[02:10:26.312 --> 02:10:28.656]  We must resist these tyrants.
[02:10:28.656 --> 02:10:33.803]  Charlie, it's good to have you on with us from the UK today.
[02:10:34.855 --> 02:10:36.756]  Hello Alex, how are things over in the States?
[02:10:36.756 --> 02:10:37.236]  Good, good.
[02:10:37.236 --> 02:10:38.856]  It's good to have you here.
[02:10:38.856 --> 02:10:53.342]  So much is going on in the world today and we see incumbents being thrown out here in the U.S., we see rioting starting all over the world, we see the world financial market basically imploding.
[02:10:53.342 --> 02:11:02.985]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and going from just somebody trying to shoot video in London being harassed to now starting to love police that's starting to catch on.
[02:11:03.973 --> 02:11:05.114]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex.
[02:11:05.114 --> 02:11:10.116]  As you said once in one of your speeches, I have an infinite human spirit which refuses to submit.
[02:11:10.116 --> 02:11:16.420]  I'm just one human being and I hate what's happening to my country, which masquerades as a free country.
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:20.622]  So, as you say, I'm just one guy with a camera, with a megaphone that goes out there to try and expose it.
[02:11:21.122 --> 02:11:47.936]  What we like to say we like to point the camera up the The rear end of evil and just show people that there's nothing to be scared of these are pathetic and lonely and sad Individuals who have no love in their hearts who just want to control others and not on my watch It's just not gonna happen as long as I'm around So when did you start to love police because you guys are really active and are gaining a lot of attention for good now on a weekly basis
[02:11:49.042 --> 02:11:52.963]  Yeah, I started The Love Police almost exactly 13 months ago.
[02:11:52.963 --> 02:11:56.805]  It kind of happened a few days after I came on your show.
[02:11:56.805 --> 02:12:02.406]  There's no connection there, but I just started filming outside the American Embassy, which you saw, and I lost my job.
[02:12:02.406 --> 02:12:07.028]  I was working for one of the main banks in Britain called the Halifax Bank of Scotland.
[02:12:07.028 --> 02:12:08.409]  Bank of Scotland's a 500-year-old institution.
[02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:13.134]  I lost my job in the recession so I was on the inside.
[02:12:13.134 --> 02:12:20.184]  I saw myself selling investments and investing in companies which are war companies, the big business parties, big
[02:12:20.914 --> 02:12:43.781]  More things so I just I just when I lost my job the illusion shattered for me and I realized I wasn't really living a real human life and one thing I find Alex is that when you do what's right the universe inspires to help you and I'm still alive I'm still going I'm I feel very happy doing what I'm doing because when you do what's right it feels automatically fun and I have to admit what I do with the camera and the megaphone is very good fun because
[02:12:44.341 --> 02:12:46.283]  I can't see myself doing anything else.
[02:12:46.283 --> 02:12:51.529]  You call your channel InfoWars and I believe we are in a war for people's consciousness.
[02:12:51.529 --> 02:13:01.299]  It is a war for equality and what the elites are trying to do, the international financiers, is to dehumanize everyone to the point where we don't even think that we should be allowed to live.
[02:13:01.299 --> 02:13:04.583]  And I have friends, my own friends, close people to me who
[02:13:05.403 --> 02:13:09.267]  Who think we should wipe each other out, who think that we need a virus to wipe us out.
[02:13:09.267 --> 02:13:10.828]  And this is what I'm trying to fight against.
[02:13:10.828 --> 02:13:14.491]  Like, the point of the Love Police is to lower fear and raise love.
[02:13:14.491 --> 02:13:22.178]  And the best way to do that is to shine a light on these puppets and show the people, the great masses, that we have nothing to be scared of them.
[02:13:22.178 --> 02:13:25.100]  And great evil things bring out the best in people.
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:25.701]  And that's all I do.
[02:13:26.704 --> 02:13:44.090]  Well normally you are loving when you're just out in the middle of the street or on the sidewalk in London and police come over and say you can't film, you can't talk to fellow people in England and really illustrating just how out of control the police state is.
[02:13:44.090 --> 02:13:46.311]  And I remember five years ago in England they started putting
[02:13:47.151 --> 02:13:50.493]  Tracker RFID chips in the trash bins.
[02:13:50.493 --> 02:13:54.175]  Now that's coming to Virginia and Texas and California.
[02:13:54.175 --> 02:14:02.860]  I remember five, six years ago, remote control thermostats in people's homes in England, where the government tracks everything you do and controls your thermostat.
[02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:06.702]  Now that's coming here to the United States.
[02:14:06.702 --> 02:14:11.225]  The police taking DNA at checkpoints started six, seven, eight years ago in England.
[02:14:11.225 --> 02:14:12.726]  Now that's coming here.
[02:14:13.326 --> 02:14:19.310]  So, England is always five, six, seven years, depending on what issue, ahead of us.
[02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:26.295]  England in the last five years has started making people take satellite tracker boxes in their cars to tax them by the mile in many cities.
[02:14:26.295 --> 02:14:34.481]  Or using the license plates to turn regular roads into toll roads with license plate identification systems.
[02:14:34.481 --> 02:14:36.543]  The secret arrest of citizens.
[02:14:36.543 --> 02:14:37.403]  Government terror.
[02:14:38.684 --> 02:14:42.928]  The center of one of the most wicked empires on earth being the British Empire.
[02:14:42.928 --> 02:14:48.854]  That model, according to Carol Quigley at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, is the British Empire model.
[02:14:48.854 --> 02:14:53.419]  Not so much the British Empire itself, though it is now bigger in the banking system than even New York.
[02:14:54.039 --> 02:15:19.787]  uh... but the system you know it's not the irish or the scottish or the english that are bad it's it's not the american people that are bad it's not the mexican government uh... the the mexican people that are bad it's the mexican government that's bad it's not the chinese people that are bad it's the chinese government that's bad uh... because in history governments tend to be ruthless and controlling and there's no doubt they're working together to bring in this world tyranny against we the people so breakdown
[02:15:20.327 --> 02:15:31.520]  The transformation in your lifetime of what the UK has turned into as a warning to the rest of the world because you are definitely sitting in the Orwellian Airstrip One, the model for the rest of the globe.
[02:15:32.307 --> 02:15:37.552]  Yeah, we are the airstrip for America and the British Cabal to launch their operations around the world.
[02:15:37.552 --> 02:15:47.462]  What I've seen in my lifetime is, just in the last 5-10 years, the incredible CCTV control, the cameras all over London.
[02:15:47.462 --> 02:15:51.846]  You can't walk around London without getting filmed by at least 300 cameras.
[02:15:51.846 --> 02:15:56.231]  And one thing we always try and say to the Love Police, if they can film us, surely we can film them.
[02:15:56.671 --> 02:15:58.852]  If they're going to be tracking us, we can track them.
[02:15:58.852 --> 02:15:59.932]  We can bother them.
[02:15:59.932 --> 02:16:01.072]  It works both ways.
[02:16:01.072 --> 02:16:06.193]  And, you know, we are strong human beings and we will not accept this total control.
[02:16:06.193 --> 02:16:07.514]  And it is a nanny state.
[02:16:07.514 --> 02:16:09.674]  It's people trying to tell us what to do.
[02:16:09.674 --> 02:16:13.375]  And I personally, Alex, I am a philosophical anarchist.
[02:16:13.375 --> 02:16:19.817]  I think government is totally the problem and the world is awakening now to a point where we will not need these antiquated
[02:16:20.317 --> 02:16:21.217]  Control system.
[02:16:21.217 --> 02:16:26.779]  So as your last caller said, yeah, they're going to throw everything at us now to try and control us and make us scared.
[02:16:26.779 --> 02:16:30.640]  You see them crisscrossing the skies with all sorts of nasty pollutants.
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:34.961]  They're putting all these horrible chemicals in our food and water, but it doesn't help them.
[02:16:34.961 --> 02:16:36.882]  Brzezinski is terrified of us.
[02:16:36.882 --> 02:16:41.963]  He knows that there is some special quantum force in the universe which will help people if you just do what's right.
[02:16:41.963 --> 02:16:46.564]  So what we have is just a few years to kind of try and wake everyone else up.
[02:16:46.564 --> 02:16:48.665]  But coming back to your question, what I've seen in the last
[02:16:49.286 --> 02:16:49.746]  Yes, we are.
[02:17:09.716 --> 02:17:20.581]  Well, I've got three articles today with census workers raping people, attacking people with attack dogs they bring to the door now as part of their petty power trip.
[02:17:20.581 --> 02:17:23.282]  Census workers who are convicted pedophiles.
[02:17:23.282 --> 02:17:26.384]  The government knew the guy was a pedophile and hired him.
[02:17:26.384 --> 02:17:34.648]  More and more of the TSA workers are robbing people, raping women, going crazy and announcing, I'm God, I'm God.
[02:17:34.648 --> 02:17:36.649]  Now several of them have just had complete
[02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:39.770]  Delusions of grandeur, believing they're God.
[02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:52.316]  They're also taking all these dumbed down fluoride heads, who've been watching television their whole life, who literally have shriveled brains, and giving them power.
[02:17:52.856 --> 02:17:54.836]  And that's what's even more sickening about tyranny.
[02:17:54.836 --> 02:18:03.138]  It's not just the far-off elitist robbing you, but you've got to put up with lesser men and women who can't get a real job, who are petty.
[02:18:03.138 --> 02:18:19.002]  You know, a real man is ashamed to exercise undue power on people and to make people grovel, but petty scum can find a million positions in this archipelago of control freak behavior.
[02:18:19.002 --> 02:18:19.302]  And so,
[02:18:19.702 --> 02:18:30.008]  Tyranny is a wonderland of corruption and then the government with taxpayer money gets to decide what films get made and what the people see.
[02:18:30.008 --> 02:18:37.552]  I mean it's a bunch of scum playing God and I am just not going to let a bunch of pedophiles with machine guns run my life.
[02:18:38.775 --> 02:18:42.257]  Alex, you're absolutely right about the pedophile thing at the top.
[02:18:42.257 --> 02:18:46.279]  It's exploding now in Scotland with a case of a girl with Down Syndrome.
[02:18:46.279 --> 02:18:49.840]  The Scottish elite, the legal and police and government elite.
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:55.343]  There was a pedophile cabal abusing a disabled young girl called Holly Grey.
[02:18:55.543 --> 02:19:01.328]  Well how many, and we've covered that, but how many Homeland Security state heads have been caught being pedophiles?
[02:19:01.328 --> 02:19:11.098]  I mean, we have to understand, how do you get people that'll steal bank accounts, rob, torture, lie, listen to people illegally, do, well, because they're criminals.
[02:19:11.098 --> 02:19:15.542]  Some are money launderers, some drug dealers, but most of them are perverts.
[02:19:15.822 --> 02:19:21.385]  And that's what we face, is a legion of pot-bellied perverts with automatic weapons.
[02:19:21.385 --> 02:19:25.907]  But the good news is the police and the military are starting to wake up here.
[02:19:25.907 --> 02:19:27.708]  Are you seeing some of the police wake up in your area?
[02:19:28.493 --> 02:19:29.433]  Massively, Alex.
[02:19:29.433 --> 02:19:38.317]  The times I get arrested, there's always a few policemen in the station that come to my cell, shake my hand, tell me I'm doing great work, that they are also concerned.
[02:19:38.317 --> 02:19:51.523]  There are good people in the military, there's good people in the police, and the job of the love police is to communicate with as many police as possible in London, give them hugs, remind them of their humanity, and also remind them what kind of world that they're going to be bringing in for their children and grandchildren.
[02:19:52.023 --> 02:19:57.065]  So it's not just a resistance thing, it's also a reminder to people of just how glorious and special they are.
[02:19:57.065 --> 02:19:58.105]  And that we're all humans!
[02:19:58.105 --> 02:19:59.286]  We're all humans!
[02:19:59.286 --> 02:20:01.167]  And we shouldn't serve the pot bellies.
[02:20:01.167 --> 02:20:05.728]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.728 --> 02:20:10.070]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:15.452]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.812 --> 02:20:16.552]  It's true.
[02:20:16.552 --> 02:20:22.254]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:22.254 --> 02:20:25.834]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.834 --> 02:20:30.536]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.536 --> 02:20:33.316]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.316 --> 02:20:36.637]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.977 --> 02:20:41.921]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.921 --> 02:20:46.984]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.984 --> 02:20:51.147]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.147 --> 02:20:52.948]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.948 --> 02:20:57.552]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.934 --> 02:21:02.975]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:02.975 --> 02:21:08.499]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:21:08.499 --> 02:21:09.039]  I get it.
[02:21:09.039 --> 02:21:18.667]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:21:18.667 --> 02:21:20.088]  That's not what's happening.
[02:21:20.088 --> 02:21:24.451]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[02:21:24.651 --> 02:21:26.492]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[02:21:26.492 --> 02:21:28.534]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[02:21:28.534 --> 02:21:31.936]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:31.936 --> 02:21:36.199]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:21:36.199 --> 02:21:37.800]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:41.763]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:41.763 --> 02:21:45.585]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:21:45.585 --> 02:21:46.486]  You should, too.
[02:21:46.486 --> 02:21:47.647]  Find out what they know.
[02:21:47.647 --> 02:21:50.889]  Call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:21:51.169 --> 02:21:51.309]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.309 --> 02:21:51.449]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.449 --> 02:21:52.650]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:52.650 --> 02:22:05.741]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:22:05.741 --> 02:22:07.002]  Tyranny is here.
[02:22:07.002 --> 02:22:10.765]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:22:10.765 --> 02:22:13.167]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:13.167 --> 02:22:18.332]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:19.008 --> 02:22:25.219]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:25.689 --> 02:22:31.632]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:31.632 --> 02:22:35.834]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:22:35.834 --> 02:22:40.117]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:22:40.117 --> 02:22:46.080]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:49.622]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:49.622 --> 02:22:51.603]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:51.603 --> 02:22:52.043]  It's here.

[02:23:00.666 --> 02:23:04.207]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:23:04.207 --> 02:23:06.488]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:23:06.488 --> 02:23:07.368]  Don't!
[02:23:07.368 --> 02:23:10.790]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[02:23:34.482 --> 02:23:35.643]  Herb K was right.

[02:23:38.865 --> 02:23:40.306]  What have you got to lose?
[02:23:40.306 --> 02:23:41.567]  Stop the calls now.

[02:23:51.916 --> 02:23:51.956]  800-822-1291.
[02:24:06.209 --> 02:24:12.834]  If you want to go to the Love Police website, it's C, the letter C, Veach dot O-R-G.
[02:24:12.834 --> 02:24:13.875]  We appreciate him joining us.
[02:24:13.875 --> 02:24:20.559]  We're going to be taking your calls coming up some in the next segment about political activism, what's happening in the world, any news items you want to mention.
[02:24:20.559 --> 02:24:22.621]  I'm going to hit some other news stories as well.
[02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:30.747]  We've got some really important news coming up on the financial front in the next hour with a political researcher and a financial author.
[02:24:31.167 --> 02:24:31.327]  I think?
[02:24:51.218 --> 02:25:02.062]  Your videos are getting hundreds of thousands of views together and it's another example of not just We Are Change or the Tea Parties or InfoWar groups or 9-11 Truth groups.
[02:25:02.062 --> 02:25:06.764]  It's just anybody can be a leader who's willing to stand up and go out and now you've had others join you.
[02:25:06.764 --> 02:25:09.645]  Now you're not out there alone and it's gaining steam.
[02:25:09.645 --> 02:25:12.006]  Another example of how resistance is victory.
[02:25:13.024 --> 02:25:13.805]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:25:13.805 --> 02:25:21.411]  I think one thing's important for people to know, you know the film The Matrix, how there's Neo, the character played by Keanu Reeves, that's an anagram of the One.
[02:25:21.411 --> 02:25:28.958]  And when everyone realizes that they are the One, they have that connection to the Source themselves, to whichever religion or spirituality you believe in.
[02:25:29.358 --> 02:25:35.540]  You are an infinite power and you have nothing to be scared of from these pathetic, controlling tyrants.
[02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:39.041]  And one thing that we like to do at the Love Police is to put these videos out there.
[02:25:39.041 --> 02:25:47.383]  We never force people to watch them, but it just shows people that you can do this and survive and be happy and have a great life just by being a decent human being.
[02:25:47.383 --> 02:25:55.985]  And for me, being a decent human being is standing up against anyone who attempts to destroy and poison my fellow human beings, and including me.
[02:25:56.905 --> 02:26:01.368]  For many years I was living under the mass hypnosis illusion that things were okay.
[02:26:01.368 --> 02:26:03.510]  I was a big believer in the mainstream media.
[02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:11.235]  I even joined the armed forces after September the 11th for the British Army because I wanted to go out there and kill terrorists because I believed it.
[02:26:11.235 --> 02:26:24.103]  And you don't know how upset and angry I am and I'm not sure yet I'll be able to forgive those people who lied to me and who lied to all those other young men and women who joined the armed forces thinking they're fighting for freedom when in fact they're fighting for Halliburton.
[02:26:25.669 --> 02:26:29.510]  What woke you up?
[02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:33.791]  I think it was a combination of luck in that I lost my job.
[02:26:33.791 --> 02:26:34.811]  I didn't quit.
[02:26:34.811 --> 02:26:37.732]  I just lost my job because the economy went bad.
[02:26:37.732 --> 02:26:40.533]  And I've always been a bit of a rebel since a young age.
[02:26:40.533 --> 02:26:43.413]  I never really listened to authority.
[02:26:43.413 --> 02:26:44.834]  I was very anti-authoritarian.
[02:26:44.834 --> 02:26:49.595]  But I think it was just maybe what people like David Icke talk about.
[02:26:49.595 --> 02:26:55.076]  There is a general vibrational change happening in the world, as Brzezinski says, a general awakening.
[02:26:55.556 --> 02:27:02.019]  And I'm just lucky that it came to me before I got sent out to Iraq to go and shoot innocent people.
[02:27:02.019 --> 02:27:02.800]  Absolutely.
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:04.400]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:11.184]  Did you see that video two weeks ago, three weeks ago, out of Pennsylvania, where it says, we're watching you, Tom.
[02:27:11.184 --> 02:27:13.445]  Nice house, nice car, Tom.
[02:27:13.445 --> 02:27:15.386]  You owe the state $3,000.
[02:27:15.386 --> 02:27:16.206]  We know where you are.
[02:27:16.206 --> 02:27:17.647]  We're coming to get you.
[02:27:17.647 --> 02:27:23.570]  And I'm seeing articles every day of people losing their houses for parking tickets or for water bills.
[02:27:24.210 --> 02:27:37.775]  And everybody I know who is not doing well financially all over the country is getting calls now where collection agencies for the government are threatening you with jail if you don't pay them.
[02:27:37.775 --> 02:27:45.558]  The taxes are all going up but the infrastructure is falling apart because almost all the money is going to the bankers like it's Nigeria or Argentina.
[02:27:45.558 --> 02:27:47.099]  And here's one out of the Huffington Post.
[02:27:47.879 --> 02:27:51.963]  Woman's home confiscated over small water bill.
[02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:56.707]  They now take your house over a $362 bill.
[02:27:56.707 --> 02:27:59.350]  I mean, if this isn't tyranny, I don't know what it is.
[02:28:00.655 --> 02:28:02.057]  It is total tyranny.
[02:28:02.057 --> 02:28:06.262]  But one thing I can say, I'm always an optimist Alex, I like to always look on the bright side.
[02:28:06.262 --> 02:28:12.108]  But these mistakes they made, this tyranny they impose, it wakes up people at a much more accelerated pace.
[02:28:12.108 --> 02:28:18.916]  And what I think, it's the bankers that cause this financial crisis, and if it's the bankers trying to take your house, what people need to do en masse is start
[02:28:19.036 --> 02:28:19.617]  Barricading
[02:28:39.597 --> 02:28:42.439]  What he says is that they didn't value freedom enough.
[02:28:42.439 --> 02:28:48.543]  People should have set up ambushes in staircases using baseball bats or hammers or pots and pans.
[02:28:48.543 --> 02:28:58.969]  And he said that if people did a massive rise up, the state does not have enough thugs to round up hundreds of thousands of people if a few hundred of them are starting to fight back.
[02:28:59.269 --> 02:29:02.770]  Yeah guys, print me the Alexander Shultz-Enitsen quote.
[02:29:02.770 --> 02:29:19.454]  It starts with, Alexander Shultz-Enitsen, oh how we burned in the camps later, wishing that when the NKVD that arrested, in the case he was talking about in Leningrad, more than half the population and took many of them to their deaths.
[02:29:19.454 --> 02:29:23.575]  But according to the government today, that's a good thing to be taken away to your death
[02:29:23.655 --> 02:29:44.545]  And here in the U.S., they're openly proposing arresting people, the Pentagon, with no charges, no nothing, secretly stripping you of your citizenship and disappearing you into a black site, into a black hole, while Salon calls me up saying, oh Alex, you're making up the FEMA camps, as they openly admit they're building the camps.
[02:29:44.545 --> 02:29:48.166]  Long segment coming up, we'll cover Shultz and Eatson's quote and a lot more.
[02:29:48.166 --> 02:29:49.327]  We're talking to the Love Police.
[02:29:51.485 --> 02:29:55.407]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.407 --> 02:30:00.851]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.851 --> 02:30:02.492]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.492 --> 02:30:05.854]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:30:22.142 --> 02:30:24.803]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:30:24.803 --> 02:30:31.305]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:30:54.179 --> 02:30:54.619]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.475 --> 02:31:05.439]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:31:05.439 --> 02:31:06.439]  What have we got?
[02:31:06.439 --> 02:31:08.881]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:31:08.881 --> 02:31:09.902]  A republic.
[02:31:09.902 --> 02:31:12.544]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:31:12.544 --> 02:31:14.806]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:31:14.806 --> 02:31:16.827]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:31:16.827 --> 02:31:18.508]  So they think they own our land?
[02:31:18.508 --> 02:31:19.829]  They think they own our water?
[02:31:19.829 --> 02:31:20.450]  Children?
[02:31:20.450 --> 02:31:21.551]  Our education?
[02:31:21.551 --> 02:31:22.391]  Our money?
[02:31:22.391 --> 02:31:26.054]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:31:26.394 --> 02:31:30.099]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:31:30.099 --> 02:31:31.381]  You have been warned.
[02:31:31.381 --> 02:31:32.402]  We have the facts.
[02:31:32.402 --> 02:31:33.564]  We have the Constitution.
[02:31:33.564 --> 02:31:34.465]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:31:34.465 --> 02:31:35.366]  We have common law.
[02:31:35.366 --> 02:31:37.890]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:37.890 --> 02:31:41.655]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:31:41.755 --> 02:31:46.719]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:31:46.719 --> 02:31:48.221]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:31:48.221 --> 02:31:49.302]  Don't tread on me.
[02:31:49.302 --> 02:31:56.168]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:32:00.353 --> 02:32:01.654]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:01.654 --> 02:32:07.257]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.257 --> 02:32:12.259]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:12.259 --> 02:32:17.302]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:32:17.842 --> 02:32:23.063]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:23.063 --> 02:32:30.185]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.185 --> 02:32:31.285]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.285 --> 02:32:37.647]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:37.987 --> 02:32:41.168]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:41.168 --> 02:32:43.389]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:43.389 --> 02:32:44.329]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:44.329 --> 02:32:44.529]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:44.529 --> 02:32:47.970]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:47.970 --> 02:32:49.690]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:10.663 --> 02:33:11.944]  Well, it's outrageous.
[02:33:11.944 --> 02:33:14.725]  Calderon has now given his speech to the Congress.
[02:33:14.725 --> 02:33:16.146]  I have the text of it.
[02:33:16.146 --> 02:33:19.708]  Paul Watson has an article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:19.708 --> 02:33:21.429]  He attacked the Second Amendment.
[02:33:22.677 --> 02:33:34.980]  Not only is a foreign dictator who wasn't elected, that's on record, who set up a total police state, a narco-terrorist state that's waging a war against other cartels that aren't laundering money through U.S.
[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:35.861]  banks.
[02:33:35.861 --> 02:33:51.045]  Not only is he here telling 30 million illegal aliens to politically rise up in our country, a foreign leader with a group of people that see themselves as foreigners, he now wants our Second Amendment and is blaming violence in his repressed country where no citizen can own guns.
[02:33:52.936 --> 02:33:56.517]  On our Second Amendment.
[02:33:56.517 --> 02:34:02.619]  And we are defeating the establishment right now peacefully with political information.
[02:34:02.619 --> 02:34:10.221]  That's why Cass Sunstein and Kagan and all these globalists are saying, censor the internet, censor free speech, shut us down.
[02:34:10.221 --> 02:34:13.422]  Because they can't get away with this if our voices are being heard.
[02:34:13.422 --> 02:34:14.683]  And so they're now coming out
[02:34:15.836 --> 02:34:22.720]  Conditioning and acclimating and testing the water, sending up trial balloons to openly shut down free speech.
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:25.621]  And every time the media calls me, they say, are you causing violence?
[02:34:25.621 --> 02:34:27.982]  Are you going to cause violence?
[02:34:27.982 --> 02:34:30.464]  Which we're speaking out against violence.
[02:34:30.464 --> 02:34:41.170]  But what does it lead to when they say we're going to start arresting you and disappearing you into a gulag, or worse, and no one will even know we took you?
[02:34:41.170 --> 02:34:42.690]  I mean, that's in the legislation.
[02:34:42.690 --> 02:34:43.671]  That's being promoted.
[02:34:45.393 --> 02:34:53.504]  And then it leads us to the point of when the secret police are coming to drag you away, then people are going to be forced to physically resist.
[02:34:53.504 --> 02:34:55.366]  That's why Oath Keepers is so important.
[02:34:55.366 --> 02:35:00.773]  That's why we're reaching out to military and police right now like our lives depend on it because they do.
[02:35:02.318 --> 02:35:03.259]  Listen to this.
[02:35:03.259 --> 02:35:05.101]  This is the Alexander Sholzhenitsyn.
[02:35:05.101 --> 02:35:06.562]  Won the Nobel Prize.
[02:35:06.562 --> 02:35:07.703]  Ronald Reagan praised him.
[02:35:07.703 --> 02:35:11.647]  For anybody demonizing him, again, this is somebody praised by our government.
[02:35:11.647 --> 02:35:13.969]  Of course, that was 25, 30 years ago.
[02:35:13.969 --> 02:35:14.749]  Not anymore.
[02:35:14.749 --> 02:35:15.610]  He's demonized now.
[02:35:16.698 --> 02:35:32.743]  And how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrest as for example in Leningrad
[02:35:33.303 --> 02:35:38.568]  When they arrested a quarter of the entire city, some estimates are almost half, but that was in one period.
[02:35:38.568 --> 02:35:56.284]  Or, if during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, pawing with terror at every bang of the downstairs door, at every step on the staircase, but had understood that they had nothing left to lose, and had boldly
[02:35:56.924 --> 02:36:04.688]  set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of a half-dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else they had at hand.
[02:36:04.688 --> 02:36:19.576]  The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt if, if we didn't love freedom enough and even more
[02:36:20.868 --> 02:36:24.009]  We had no awareness of the real situation.
[02:36:24.009 --> 02:36:27.950]  We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.
[02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:30.611]  Alexander Shelton Edson.
[02:36:30.611 --> 02:36:33.192]  So, here's the article.
[02:36:33.192 --> 02:36:35.472]  It's up at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:35.472 --> 02:36:39.514]  It's also at GCNLive.com.
[02:36:39.514 --> 02:36:40.914]  This is up at GCNLive.com.
[02:36:40.914 --> 02:36:43.415]  It's pointing this article out to everyone.
[02:36:43.415 --> 02:36:46.776]  Dictator of failed state lectures Americans about freedom.
[02:36:49.431 --> 02:36:52.453]  Dear Mr. Calderon, get the hell out of the U.S.
[02:36:52.453 --> 02:36:56.816]  That is the sub-headline I had Watson write by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[02:36:56.816 --> 02:36:58.497]  We wrote this together this morning.
[02:36:58.497 --> 02:37:07.723]  Americans were once again forced to endure the dictator of a failed state which represses and subjugates its citizens as a matter of course lecturing the U.S.
[02:37:07.723 --> 02:37:16.148]  about how his people were being discriminated against yesterday when unelected Mexican President Felipe Calderon bashed the Arizona
[02:37:16.508 --> 02:37:17.709]  Illegal immigration law.
[02:37:17.709 --> 02:37:24.976]  Calderon commented, such laws as an Arizona law is forcing our people to face discrimination during a White House meeting.
[02:37:24.976 --> 02:37:28.138]  Calderon later attacked the Second Amendment in a speech to the U.S.
[02:37:28.138 --> 02:37:28.659]  Congress.
[02:37:28.659 --> 02:37:31.301]  Get out of our internal affairs!
[02:37:31.301 --> 02:37:32.863]  Using a political weapon against us!
[02:37:32.863 --> 02:37:33.984]  This is treason!
[02:37:33.984 --> 02:37:34.844]  This is sedition!
[02:37:34.844 --> 02:37:36.106]  This is an invasion!
[02:37:36.106 --> 02:37:39.649]  This is a foreign leader trying to evoke sedition in our country!
[02:37:40.731 --> 02:37:58.040]  Blaming Mexico's spiraling drug violence on guns being smuggled from inside America, though the studies show over 90% are being bought by the army and then sold, while failing to mention the fact that the lax border security, something we vehemently support, but only on American borders, is the primary cause of the problem.
[02:37:58.941 --> 02:38:05.834]  And he says Calderon's use of the term our people is a slap in the face of every American and every Hispanic American who has immigrated legally.
[02:38:05.834 --> 02:38:10.403]  Since when did the leader of a foreign nation address his own constituency from within
[02:38:11.843 --> 02:38:13.804]  An entirely different country.
[02:38:13.804 --> 02:38:19.086]  If the millions of illegal aliens living in America see themselves as Mexicans, then why do they insist on staying in the U.S.
[02:38:19.086 --> 02:38:19.706]  illegally?
[02:38:19.706 --> 02:38:21.206]  Well, because they say this is Mexico.
[02:38:21.206 --> 02:38:25.348]  Well, but if the Mexican system's so good, why don't you stay in Mexico then?
[02:38:25.348 --> 02:38:33.671]  Now, expanding on that, we played a video clip earlier, and I don't know if Watson has this in the article, where Obama said, we've gone past our borders.
[02:38:33.671 --> 02:38:35.051]  We're one country.
[02:38:35.051 --> 02:38:36.272]  I mean, that is treason.
[02:38:37.165 --> 02:38:54.942]  Going back to Charlie Veitch of the Love Police, they're doing the same thing in England, bringing in masses of foreigners who are just human beings too, but then playing them off against the rest of the people in the country as a political weapon and as a tool of balkanization.
[02:38:54.942 --> 02:38:55.783]  What's your view on that?
[02:38:56.798 --> 02:38:57.518]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:38:57.518 --> 02:39:07.424]  I'm happy you brought that up, because in many of my films, many of the commenters noticed how the most aggressive, physically, people are the non-native British.
[02:39:07.424 --> 02:39:22.373]  And as you say, they're human beings as well, but these are people from Rwanda, or from Sudan, or from Serbia, Bosnia, who've been through a war, a war zone, and now they've been given a police community support officer with police powers uniform, and they are violent!
[02:39:22.373 --> 02:39:23.374]  I've never had a, um,
[02:39:24.134 --> 02:39:28.117]  A native gentleman Englishman, a policeman, hit me.
[02:39:28.117 --> 02:39:33.721]  But I have had security thugs from Eastern Europe and from Africa, you know.
[02:39:33.721 --> 02:39:37.004]  God bless them, but they... Let me just interrupt again.
[02:39:37.004 --> 02:39:46.210]  I had a Member of Parliament on a few months ago and he admitted that over half of the CPS workers kidnapping kids are foreigners as well who can't even speak English.
[02:39:46.210 --> 02:39:47.571]  So, we know what this is.
[02:39:47.571 --> 02:39:52.555]  Bring in foreigners, give them uniforms, make them the military and the police, and they'll do whatever they're told.
[02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:54.391]  Absolutely Alex.
[02:39:54.391 --> 02:40:00.154]  And one thing I think is very important for me to say because a lot of my friends are saying, oh Alex Jones is a fear monger.
[02:40:00.154 --> 02:40:01.255]  Alex, you're not a fear monger.
[02:40:01.255 --> 02:40:02.996]  You give the information truthfully.
[02:40:02.996 --> 02:40:03.917]  You work on fact.
[02:40:03.917 --> 02:40:07.359]  And it's in the eye of the perceiver whether they are scared of it or not.
[02:40:07.359 --> 02:40:08.720]  We are in a battle right now.
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:09.881]  We are at the brink.
[02:40:09.881 --> 02:40:12.522]  And self-defense is very different from offense.
[02:40:12.522 --> 02:40:13.403]  I just wanted to say that.
[02:40:13.703 --> 02:40:23.885]  Well, it is scary to say there's a world government that plans to implode economies by design by selling fraudulent derivatives to government and then loaning the government's more fiat money.
[02:40:23.885 --> 02:40:26.045]  It is scary they're putting poison in the water.
[02:40:26.045 --> 02:40:29.366]  It is scary they launched two illegal wars and are about to go into Iran.
[02:40:29.366 --> 02:40:34.247]  It is scary that they're setting up this police state and bringing in foreigners to rule over us.
[02:40:34.247 --> 02:40:39.668]  It is scary that tens of trillions have been stolen and the whole world is on the verge of financial collapse.
[02:40:40.928 --> 02:40:46.573]  Again, that's a child-like mind that thinks that I'm saying something so that creates the fear.
[02:40:46.573 --> 02:41:02.407]  If I live in a valley and a huge dam breaks and the alarms go off saying, get out, you've got five minutes, 30 feet of fast-moving water is coming, it will kill you, am I a fear-monger if I get on the radio of a dam broke and told people get to high ground?
[02:41:03.427 --> 02:41:04.287]  No, you're not.
[02:41:04.287 --> 02:41:11.551]  Were those people in the Warsaw Jewish uprising, were they fear mongers for telling the other Jewish people that the Nazis were coming to kill them?
[02:41:11.551 --> 02:41:17.454]  Were they fear mongers for rising up against the Nazis in a last-bit attempt to save their lives and their friends' lives?
[02:41:17.454 --> 02:41:18.014]  No, they're not.
[02:41:18.014 --> 02:41:24.277]  They were just looking at the truth and acting as a decent, you know, as a kind of conscious human being should.
[02:41:24.277 --> 02:41:28.940]  Versus all the other footage we've seen of Jewish families and others
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:43.240]  They'd separate the kids and send them off to be killed, and they'd run the women into pits naked, the men into pits, and shoot them, and the next group, seeing them being herded in to be shot, would still run right in, like gentlemen, to be killed.
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:44.482]  That's not going to happen with me.
[02:41:45.203 --> 02:41:47.125]  I'm not running into any pit.
[02:41:47.125 --> 02:41:53.411]  I mean, at the moment of watching people's heads being... And I saw footage from Nigeria about two months ago.
[02:41:53.411 --> 02:41:54.632]  In fact, Burmese has it.
[02:41:54.632 --> 02:41:56.734]  Will you ask him to bring us that footage?
[02:41:56.734 --> 02:42:01.779]  And they're bringing people in the middle of the town square, having them lay down, and then shooting them.
[02:42:01.779 --> 02:42:03.941]  And these guys could have run, they could have fought.
[02:42:03.941 --> 02:42:08.986]  I mean, I'm an extremist that I'm saying I'm not going into a pit to be shot.
[02:42:10.037 --> 02:42:10.998]  No, David.
[02:42:10.998 --> 02:42:11.518]  Sorry, Alex.
[02:42:11.518 --> 02:42:20.624]  Yes, I'm actually... I spoke to a lady who ran to be a Member of Parliament, and she told me that I am on a domestic extremist list.
[02:42:20.624 --> 02:42:26.228]  So I need to have a few days notice if there is going to be a roundup, because they would round me up, of course.
[02:42:26.228 --> 02:42:34.353]  And just like you, I would also do everything I could right now, because in Britain we do not have big trains taking people away to camps.
[02:42:34.353 --> 02:42:35.994]  So right now the best way I can see us
[02:42:36.454 --> 02:42:40.943]  Fighting this is just to raise awareness and raise the consciousness, raise the humanity.
[02:42:40.943 --> 02:42:45.030]  No, they just slowly arrest people and then you get processed into the jail.
[02:42:45.030 --> 02:42:46.072]  That's how this works now.
[02:42:47.717 --> 02:42:54.682]  Yeah, it is very scary when we realize we are living in those crazy films that we never thought would come true, but this is reality now.
[02:42:54.682 --> 02:43:04.248]  This is actually happening, and I wish people could see this, and I wish people would stop projecting their own fears onto us, saying that we are fearmongers for talking about this.
[02:43:04.248 --> 02:43:06.670]  All we're doing is saying this isn't how it should be.
[02:43:07.210 --> 02:43:07.270]  Yes.
[02:43:26.969 --> 02:43:28.150]  The people are starting to listen.
[02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.951]  But I interrupt you.
[02:43:28.951 --> 02:43:32.435]  Go back to this point because I've been questioned in England.
[02:43:32.435 --> 02:43:36.339]  If you even talk to anybody on the street, that is criminal because you're all prisoners.
[02:43:36.339 --> 02:43:41.384]  Steve Watson, who lives in London, it's happened to him going to a concert with his girlfriend.
[02:43:41.384 --> 02:43:47.911]  They do this to everybody now and describe foreigners in uniform hitting you.
[02:43:47.911 --> 02:43:49.552]  Yeah, I know it's outrageous.
[02:43:50.939 --> 02:44:05.708]  Yeah, I'm just going through my mind all the different times when police have arrested me under a public order offence for talking about the connection between big business and war, for talking about how only countries with oil seem to get invaded, and the police lie.
[02:44:05.708 --> 02:44:06.868]  They tell so many lies.
[02:44:06.868 --> 02:44:11.771]  They say, oh, a member of the public is now offended, so now we need to arrest you because you've offended someone.
[02:44:11.771 --> 02:44:12.752]  It's a hate crime.
[02:44:13.172 --> 02:44:17.494]  You know, there's Muslims here on the street and you're talking about a future war with Iran.
[02:44:17.494 --> 02:44:18.475]  We need to arrest you.
[02:44:18.475 --> 02:44:21.056]  This could be a race hate crime and it's just ridiculous.
[02:44:21.056 --> 02:44:21.977]  It is George Orwell's 1984.
[02:44:21.977 --> 02:44:28.860]  Well, they arrested Robin Page seven years ago, BBC reporter, because he used the word homosexual in a speech.
[02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:30.881]  They said that word is hateful.
[02:44:30.881 --> 02:44:32.262]  I mean, this is real.
[02:44:33.314 --> 02:44:34.475]  I know.
[02:44:34.475 --> 02:44:50.013]  It blows my mind Alex but all we need to do is just keep doing what's right with zero compromise and when you do what's right the universe will help you and for me what is right is defending freedom, it's defending that human spirit which will not bow down and I will not bow down before any other man because I'm a sentient
[02:44:50.393 --> 02:44:51.074]  Well, I mean look at how
[02:45:06.414 --> 02:45:13.578]  Five thousand years ago, Kings wore crowns, just newer versions of headdresses to say, I'm better than you, I'm the authority.
[02:45:13.578 --> 02:45:24.805]  Same thing with cops, big hats with big glistening signets on them, and logos, and big giant monolithic government buildings to send the message, we're the big government, you're little.
[02:45:24.805 --> 02:45:26.126]  They send that message
[02:45:27.086 --> 02:45:45.146]  by design to separate the government uh... from the people but but specifically i've seen the videos of this it's almost as seen in new york we are change the cops that can barely speak english from all over the world chinese russian you name it polish uh... mexican
[02:45:47.188 --> 02:45:51.371]  Literally can't speak English when they walk over and go, turn your camera off!
[02:45:51.371 --> 02:45:52.491]  I take you to jail!
[02:45:52.491 --> 02:45:53.852]  Listen to me!
[02:45:53.852 --> 02:45:57.934]  And the government knowingly is hiring foreigners to do this.
[02:45:57.934 --> 02:45:59.815]  That's a big political issue in the U.S.
[02:45:59.815 --> 02:46:00.556]  and England.
[02:46:00.556 --> 02:46:01.797]  We need to start pointing this out.
[02:46:01.797 --> 02:46:03.778]  They're bringing the foreigners in to be our rulers.
[02:46:04.687 --> 02:46:06.348]  Yeah, and they've done this throughout history.
[02:46:06.348 --> 02:46:20.715]  You know, in the Chinese, when the Tiananmen Square thing, you know, China's a country of like 200 different ethnicities, and what they did when they, to Beijing, they brought in farmers, farmer troops from the rural areas who had no problem shooting people who weren't like them.
[02:46:20.715 --> 02:46:23.996]  And then in Britain right now as well, you know, got all these people from different countries.
[02:46:23.996 --> 02:46:25.357]  They don't feel that same, maybe,
[02:46:26.017 --> 02:46:26.917]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:46:41.062 --> 02:47:03.406]  Sometimes I despair because I can show people like even the people closest to me a lot of my work and they go and so what who cares like it's not really happening because they've been you know dumbed down by Hollywood and they think almost that the paramilitary black uniforms are cool because it's in a Beyonce video Rihanna has got them dancing on stage with her it's it's it's it's incredible when you go down the rabbit hole and you see how it's all connected you start connecting the dots
[02:47:04.634 --> 02:47:09.156]  And you show them government documents where they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, and they giggle.
[02:47:09.156 --> 02:47:11.097]  And then five years later, they're dying of cancer.
[02:47:11.097 --> 02:47:13.718]  It's still funny!
[02:47:13.718 --> 02:47:15.398]  Because it's a mind trick.
[02:47:15.398 --> 02:47:23.582]  It's Crime Stop from Orwell, where they decide it isn't a threat to them, and so they're part of the power structure.
[02:47:24.591 --> 02:47:29.013]  Yeah, Alex, I had a very close friend of mine who was doing love police films with me.
[02:47:29.013 --> 02:47:34.596]  I'm going to, I'm going to respect his privacy, but he got arrested and he's got three children.
[02:47:34.596 --> 02:47:45.062]  And the police said, unless you comply with us and bow down and stop doing these films, we will get a psychiatrist here and section you, which means to keep you under the mental health act, you will lose your children.
[02:47:45.402 --> 02:47:46.723]  And that's how they shut him up.
[02:47:46.723 --> 02:47:48.225]  And luckily, I don't have kids.
[02:47:48.225 --> 02:47:50.266]  But it is a psychological battle.
[02:47:50.266 --> 02:47:52.168]  And it makes me despair sometimes.
[02:47:52.168 --> 02:47:53.329]  But I'm very optimistic.
[02:47:53.329 --> 02:47:54.390]  I know we will win this.
[02:47:54.390 --> 02:47:56.111]  You wouldn't be doing your radio show.
[02:47:56.111 --> 02:47:57.212]  I wouldn't be doing my films.
[02:47:57.212 --> 02:47:58.453]  Well, think of that tyranny.
[02:47:58.453 --> 02:47:59.854]  Think of that ultimate tyranny.
[02:47:59.854 --> 02:48:03.597]  It's like Gary Cooper had his son taken.
[02:48:03.597 --> 02:48:06.320]  And it was in the police report.
[02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:08.802]  They've taught their children not to trust the government.
[02:48:08.802 --> 02:48:10.143]  And the court said, we're taking him.
[02:48:10.908 --> 02:48:11.088]  Yeah.
[02:48:40.888 --> 02:48:44.652]  Yeah, his main message was everything is okay.
[02:48:44.652 --> 02:48:49.977]  He was a very spiritual man, still is, and he went out there just wanting to lower fear around people.
[02:48:49.977 --> 02:48:54.841]  And they, I don't know if they were physical with him, but they were certainly psychological in the Soviet way.
[02:48:54.841 --> 02:49:03.269]  And actually just this week in Norway, a friend of mine said there's a doctor been thrown in a psychiatric institution for speaking out against the swine flu vaccine.
[02:49:03.269 --> 02:49:06.072]  And Norway is probably, you know, people don't know this, one of the last
[02:49:06.272 --> 02:49:28.807]  You truly communitarian communist countries in Europe and it's a it's it's mind-boggling but you know we just need to stay strong stay alive realize we're all in this together and I think Alex they will fail the elites will fail because the system will collapse because you can't treat people like this and people are realizing this so I reckon it's maybe two or three years before
[02:49:29.347 --> 02:49:32.810]  There's utter chaos, and I, you know, they try and bring about order out of chaos.
[02:49:32.810 --> 02:49:34.451]  That's the Illuminati motto.
[02:49:34.451 --> 02:49:39.195]  I think we need to bring about a bit of peaceful chaos out of their manufactured slave order.
[02:49:39.195 --> 02:49:39.936]  It's the only way.
[02:49:39.936 --> 02:49:46.061]  We need to get the universe spinning in different ways, because as it stands now, it's not a world I want to bring any children into.
[02:49:46.061 --> 02:49:49.383]  So, you know, gotta do what's right.
[02:49:49.383 --> 02:49:50.424]  Think about that, though.
[02:49:50.424 --> 02:49:51.025]  They told him...
[02:49:52.645 --> 02:49:54.186]  People can go watch the videos.
[02:49:54.186 --> 02:49:59.570]  You're not going to go to a town square and talk to people and come up to police and say, we care about you.
[02:49:59.570 --> 02:50:00.950]  We're all humans together.
[02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:05.453]  We eat at the same restaurants, same grocery stores.
[02:50:05.453 --> 02:50:06.654]  Our children are growing up.
[02:50:06.654 --> 02:50:08.435]  Look at this police state.
[02:50:08.435 --> 02:50:10.537]  You know, let's let's care about each other.
[02:50:10.537 --> 02:50:13.158]  And that's just we're taking your kids.
[02:50:13.158 --> 02:50:14.659]  You do not do that.
[02:50:14.659 --> 02:50:16.681]  I mean, you do not talk.
[02:50:17.381 --> 02:50:18.862]  You do not talk!
[02:50:18.862 --> 02:50:27.229]  Think of how evil those police are, that they think it's okay to terrorize someone for their children.
[02:50:27.229 --> 02:50:31.413]  They think of us literally as sub-human trash.
[02:50:31.413 --> 02:50:38.278]  And notice, as soon as the tyranny comes in, as soon as they've got enough people ready to oppress, the banks just steal everything.
[02:50:38.278 --> 02:50:44.763]  The system is robbing everyone, reducing us down to just groveling slaves.
[02:50:45.626 --> 02:50:49.834]  We're going to come back, talk to Frank, Mark, Bobby, Seth and others for the next two short segments.
[02:50:49.834 --> 02:50:54.402]  We've got another guest coming up with big solutions on the state's rights movement and a lot more.
[02:50:54.402 --> 02:50:55.284]  You'll want to stay with us.
[02:50:55.284 --> 02:50:56.806]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:01.587 --> 02:51:02.507]  You worry.
[02:51:02.507 --> 02:51:04.528]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:51:04.528 --> 02:51:07.070]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:51:07.070 --> 02:51:09.151]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:51:09.151 --> 02:51:10.771]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:51:10.771 --> 02:51:14.353]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:51:14.353 --> 02:51:19.596]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:51:19.596 --> 02:51:23.397]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:51:23.397 --> 02:51:24.698]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:51:25.089 --> 02:51:27.950]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[02:51:27.950 --> 02:51:31.251]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:51:31.251 --> 02:51:39.694]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:51:39.694 --> 02:51:44.376]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[02:52:01.178 --> 02:52:06.160]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:06.941]  What have we got?
[02:52:06.941 --> 02:52:09.582]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.582 --> 02:52:10.602]  A republic.
[02:52:10.602 --> 02:52:13.243]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.243 --> 02:52:15.504]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.504 --> 02:52:17.545]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.545 --> 02:52:23.107]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:52:23.107 --> 02:52:26.749]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.105 --> 02:52:30.807]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:30.807 --> 02:52:32.087]  You are being warned!
[02:52:32.087 --> 02:52:33.107]  We have the facts.
[02:52:33.107 --> 02:52:34.268]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.268 --> 02:52:35.168]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.168 --> 02:52:36.049]  We have common law.
[02:52:36.049 --> 02:52:38.590]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:38.590 --> 02:52:41.531]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:52:41.531 --> 02:52:42.471]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:42.471 --> 02:52:47.433]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:47.433 --> 02:52:48.934]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:48.934 --> 02:52:50.014]  Don't Tread on Me.
[02:52:50.014 --> 02:52:51.295]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:52.415 --> 02:52:56.719]  Ariel Spring, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[02:52:56.719 --> 02:52:58.380]  You have a choice to keep your body clean

[02:53:53.164 --> 02:53:53.284]  Sorry.
[02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:24.333]  You're physically assaulting me.
[02:54:24.333 --> 02:54:25.775]  I love the Guido attitude.
[02:54:25.775 --> 02:54:30.139]  Hey, you can't physically assault me.
[02:54:30.139 --> 02:54:31.380]  No, you can't.
[02:54:31.380 --> 02:54:32.741]  I can report you then.
[02:54:32.741 --> 02:54:38.467]  You can't physically assault me.
[02:54:38.467 --> 02:54:39.508]  Yeah, I love it.
[02:54:39.508 --> 02:54:40.649]  You sound like an American now.
[02:54:40.649 --> 02:54:41.489]  Have a nice day.
[02:54:41.489 --> 02:54:41.850]  Yeah.
[02:54:52.708 --> 02:54:54.416]  Video after video.
[02:54:55.962 --> 02:55:01.264]  Of people coming over if you have a camera in public and hitting you, attacking it.
[02:55:01.264 --> 02:55:03.124]  But they don't mind if the government's watching them.
[02:55:03.124 --> 02:55:04.005]  And all over the U.S.
[02:55:04.005 --> 02:55:06.405]  police are arresting people for wiretapping.
[02:55:06.405 --> 02:55:11.287]  And they videotape police in public when there's no perception of privacy.
[02:55:11.287 --> 02:55:12.087]  It's just crazy.
[02:55:12.087 --> 02:55:16.569]  And I've noticed there's these comments over there by people of, you must be an American.
[02:55:16.569 --> 02:55:21.150]  So I guess they said that to you when you were talking to the new Prime Minister during his press conference.
[02:55:21.150 --> 02:55:23.311]  They said, oh shut up American.
[02:55:23.311 --> 02:55:23.711]  So I guess
[02:55:24.471 --> 02:55:27.313]  Calling somebody an American is like a big insult.
[02:55:27.313 --> 02:55:46.604]  Yeah, well, what it is Alex, it's from World War II when a lot of the GIs were over in Britain and obviously American men probably a bit more tanned, a bit more muscular than some of the English and so they got lots of English girls and there was a big resentment amongst English men about the Yanks and Bertie Thomas, you know, being very boisterous and having fun and enjoying the women.
[02:55:46.604 --> 02:55:49.686]  So it is a 60-year-old racism against
[02:55:50.246 --> 02:55:50.527]  Yeah yeah.
[02:56:15.663 --> 02:56:16.464]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:56:16.464 --> 02:56:20.966]  Yeah, I know all your info is factual and true, but you guys are really missing the real conspiracy.
[02:56:20.966 --> 02:56:23.128]  We're fighting satanic beings, man.
[02:56:23.128 --> 02:56:27.671]  I mean, real live creatures that you could actually make physical contact with.
[02:56:27.671 --> 02:56:29.392]  You know, my wife said that last night.
[02:56:29.392 --> 02:56:32.914]  We were at dinner and she said, Alex, of course we're being attacked.
[02:56:32.914 --> 02:56:34.335]  Of course you're being attacked.
[02:56:34.335 --> 02:56:36.777]  You're not just fighting the New World Order.
[02:56:36.777 --> 02:56:39.799]  I mean, you are on a front to the devil.
[02:56:40.519 --> 02:56:44.082]  And, I mean, what else do you call it when the government in the U.S.
[02:56:44.082 --> 02:56:47.645]  grabs over a million kids a year and abuses the daylights out of them?
[02:56:47.645 --> 02:56:55.011]  What else do you call it when they poison the water and the food by design in their own documents to sterilize us and give us cancer?
[02:56:55.011 --> 02:56:58.734]  So, I mean, regardless if you believe in it or not, that's what it is.
[02:56:58.734 --> 02:57:00.756]  It's just pure pit-of-hell evil.
[02:57:00.756 --> 02:57:01.456]  Go ahead.
[02:57:01.456 --> 02:57:02.817]  You can actually see them, though.
[02:57:02.817 --> 02:57:07.281]  I've seen them 36 times between 1980 and Corpus Christi, it started.
[02:57:08.144 --> 02:57:10.505]  And I won't get into how it all happened.
[02:57:10.505 --> 02:57:13.367]  I got involved with some witches.
[02:57:13.367 --> 02:57:15.868]  Unbeknownst to me, I was a new Christian.
[02:57:15.868 --> 02:57:17.269]  And I opened up myself to them.
[02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:21.011]  I dared a girl to do it that claimed she could conjure demons.
[02:57:21.011 --> 02:57:24.053]  And as a joke, on Halloween night, she sicced one on me.
[02:57:24.053 --> 02:57:27.935]  It sounds funny, but it was a big, black, smoky-looking thing.
[02:57:27.935 --> 02:57:29.716]  And it tried to wrap itself around my neck.
[02:57:29.716 --> 02:57:31.657]  And I just called for Jesus, and it took off.
[02:57:31.657 --> 02:57:34.499]  But after that, I have made contact with these things.
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:35.841]  36 times.
[02:57:35.841 --> 02:57:39.183]  I actually struck one in Amarillo, Texas one night with my fist.
[02:57:39.183 --> 02:57:44.927]  Another time, the last time it was outside Austin at 3.30 in the morning.
[02:57:44.927 --> 02:57:48.469]  Frank, I appreciate your call, but I really don't, I mean, I don't go there.
[02:57:48.469 --> 02:57:52.873]  I only stick to what I can prove and document, but there's a lot of weird stuff going on in this world.
[02:57:52.873 --> 02:57:55.775]  And I know the globalists, they do believe in this.
[02:57:55.775 --> 02:57:59.117]  Almost all the top globalists are Luciferians.
[02:57:59.117 --> 02:58:01.719]  Any comments on that from our guest, Charlie?
[02:58:02.728 --> 02:58:03.909]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:58:03.909 --> 02:58:07.932]  My favorite inspirer is actually another Texan like yourself, Bill Hicks.
[02:58:07.932 --> 02:58:12.134]  He talked a lot about the people at the top doing things with Satan.
[02:58:12.134 --> 02:58:18.759]  And to me, whether they are real demons in this universe or whatever, the metaphor of calling them Satanists is correct.
[02:58:18.759 --> 02:58:24.183]  But let's not forget, a lot of the guys at the top, the elites, they are atheists in the Christian monotheistic sense.
[02:58:24.183 --> 02:58:25.804]  They believe in another religion which
[02:58:26.324 --> 02:58:30.266]  They will take energy, lots of dark energy and fear, and then use it.
[02:58:30.266 --> 02:58:32.767]  But it's just a sign of their sick mind.
[02:58:32.767 --> 02:58:35.669]  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:58:35.669 --> 02:58:39.230]  If you call them Satanists, they're just pathetic people.
[02:58:39.230 --> 02:58:42.692]  Stay there, got a break.
[02:58:42.692 --> 02:58:46.394]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.394 --> 02:58:48.355]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.581 --> 02:58:54.583]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.583 --> 02:58:59.905]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.905 --> 02:59:01.966]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.966 --> 02:59:06.969]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:06.969 --> 02:59:08.150]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.870]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.270 --> 02:59:11.151]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.151 --> 02:59:12.212]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.212 --> 02:59:14.433]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.433 --> 02:59:15.754]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.754 --> 02:59:17.295]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.295 --> 02:59:22.559]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.559 --> 02:59:25.681]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.141 --> 02:59:29.964]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:29.964 --> 02:59:31.185]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.185 --> 02:59:32.085]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.085 --> 02:59:33.206]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.206 --> 02:59:34.127]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.127 --> 02:59:35.228]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.228 --> 02:59:38.270]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.270 --> 02:59:40.051]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.051 --> 02:59:40.952]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:53.962 --> 02:59:56.369]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.369 --> 02:59:59.138]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:06.425 --> 03:00:16.088]  We've got an author coming up to discuss the State Bank of North Dakota and more on how to take our monetary system back from the offshore bankers.
[03:00:16.088 --> 03:00:24.790]  We're in our final segment with Charlie Veach and we've got links up to his website at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:00:24.790 --> 03:00:27.671]  The website is cveach.org.
[03:00:27.671 --> 03:00:28.431]  Just see in front of the
[03:00:29.071 --> 03:00:30.231]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Charlie.
[03:00:30.231 --> 03:00:31.992]  Listen, Alex, to me, what's happening here is this is an attack.
[03:00:31.992 --> 03:00:34.612]  It's an attack on the seed of who we are as human beings.
[03:00:34.612 --> 03:00:34.972]  It's an attack
[03:00:59.364 --> 03:01:00.664]  On our consciousness.
[03:01:00.664 --> 03:01:01.365]  It's an attack.
[03:01:01.365 --> 03:01:04.065]  They're attacking the DNA of who we are.
[03:01:04.065 --> 03:01:06.826]  They're seeking to attack the food DNA.
[03:01:06.826 --> 03:01:11.707]  They're seeking to attack the DNA of our laws of a free republic.
[03:01:11.707 --> 03:01:12.708]  Yeah, they're playing God.
[03:01:12.708 --> 03:01:18.149]  They're rewriting the universe in their Hellraiser image.
[03:01:18.149 --> 03:01:23.991]  So to me, they might be the great deceivers, but we are the great perceivers.
[03:01:23.991 --> 03:01:27.892]  And you are leading that, along with others like yourself, Charlie.
[03:01:28.590 --> 03:01:28.930]  I don't think so.
[03:01:46.846 --> 03:01:47.246]  I think?
[03:02:03.837 --> 03:02:06.499]  Altering our DNA through the toxins, that's admitted.
[03:02:06.499 --> 03:02:08.340]  Human DNA is now changing rapidly.
[03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:09.981]  They are poisoning us.
[03:02:09.981 --> 03:02:11.422]  The world government's only the beginning.
[03:02:11.422 --> 03:02:12.543]  They want to get rid of us.
[03:02:12.543 --> 03:02:15.265]  And in closing, that was a great call, Mark.
[03:02:15.265 --> 03:02:18.087]  I want you to, you know, speak to what he was just saying.
[03:02:19.301 --> 03:02:20.562]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex.
[03:02:20.562 --> 03:02:28.746]  It's an ongoing battle between left brain and right brain, between the machine hearts and machine minds and the spiritual, alive human beings.
[03:02:28.746 --> 03:02:34.409]  The machine men, they hate us because they are so jealous of the love that we have in our hearts.
[03:02:34.409 --> 03:02:40.193]  They are so jealous of the fact that we don't give up, that we actually stand for truth and for each other.
[03:02:40.193 --> 03:02:44.495]  So, they will always try and control us because they don't understand us.
[03:02:44.495 --> 03:02:48.097]  And, you know, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.
[03:02:48.457 --> 03:02:55.199]  They fear us, which is why they are so desperate to control us, and they will fail, and I'm happy to say they will fail, and I'll make sure they fail my end.
[03:02:55.199 --> 03:02:56.819]  I hope everyone does their end as well.
[03:02:56.819 --> 03:02:59.100]  Yeah, I can hear Yoda.
[03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:01.520]  Hate leads to the dark side.
[03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:01.880]  Indeed.
[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:04.801]  And there's no doubt the dark side is upon us.
[03:03:04.801 --> 03:03:08.102]  Let's jam in one more call.
[03:03:08.102 --> 03:03:09.662]  Let's talk to Bobby in Texas.
[03:03:09.662 --> 03:03:10.302]  You're on the air.
[03:03:10.302 --> 03:03:12.963]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[03:03:12.963 --> 03:03:13.703]  Pretty good, my friend.
[03:03:13.703 --> 03:03:16.264]  Fellow thought criminal today.
[03:03:18.135 --> 03:03:46.214]  Listen, I wanted to ask your guest from England, if he thinks that they have something kind of like we do here in the western states, like North and South Com, and how did England go from kind of being a, you know, what happened to us back in the 80s where we were worried about the communists, then all of a sudden it just kind of flips over and turns against the people, because I think it happened there faster.
[03:03:46.983 --> 03:04:00.311]  Well, they started a lot of that by staging terror attacks, blaming it on the IRA, and we're going to keep you safe, and then political correctness, but I appreciate your comments on that quickly.
[03:04:01.206 --> 03:04:02.807]  Well, the way they do it is the way they've always done it.
[03:04:02.807 --> 03:04:03.808]  It's mainstream media.
[03:04:03.808 --> 03:04:05.970]  Just keep repetition, repetition, repetition.
[03:04:05.970 --> 03:04:11.193]  Just, you know, tell people about climate change and that human beings are the problem, you know, that we're pathetic.
[03:04:11.193 --> 03:04:12.675]  And the Hollywood as well.
[03:04:12.675 --> 03:04:15.617]  And also, you know, British film is Hollywood films nowadays.
[03:04:15.617 --> 03:04:19.420]  Just keep reminding people that they're worthless, that they are the biggest problem.
[03:04:19.420 --> 03:04:22.142]  And in all the newspapers, you don't get good news on the newspaper.
[03:04:22.142 --> 03:04:25.104]  You hear about rape, war, famines, stabbings, murder.
[03:04:25.584 --> 03:04:28.946]  And you know, people start to think, oh my God, we are terrible creatures.
[03:04:28.946 --> 03:04:31.448]  Thank God we have these elites to look after us.
[03:04:31.448 --> 03:04:34.810]  And it's just, it's a propaganda war as your channel, Alex.
[03:04:34.810 --> 03:04:37.112]  It's an info war.
[03:04:37.112 --> 03:04:38.493]  Charlie Beach of the Lubb Police.
[03:04:38.493 --> 03:04:40.654]  Look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[03:04:40.654 --> 03:04:44.677]  Keep up the great work and folks can contact you and get involved in what you're doing.
[03:04:44.677 --> 03:04:48.180]  Or they can roll over and get scared and give in to these people.
[03:04:48.180 --> 03:04:51.362]  We're about getting past the fear and taking action.
[03:04:51.362 --> 03:04:52.222]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:52.222 --> 03:04:52.623]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.998 --> 03:05:02.319]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.319 --> 03:05:07.903]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:05:07.903 --> 03:05:12.926]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:05:12.926 --> 03:05:17.950]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:05:18.470 --> 03:05:23.694]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:05:23.694 --> 03:05:26.015]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:05:26.015 --> 03:05:30.818]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:05:30.818 --> 03:05:31.939]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:31.939 --> 03:05:35.001]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:05:35.001 --> 03:05:38.624]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:05:38.624 --> 03:05:41.826]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:05:41.826 --> 03:05:44.047]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:05:44.047 --> 03:05:44.968]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:05:48.610 --> 03:05:50.033]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:05:50.033 --> 03:05:57.688]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:05:57.688 --> 03:06:00.072]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:02.591 --> 03:06:06.554]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:06.554 --> 03:06:15.421]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:06:15.421 --> 03:06:20.045]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:06:20.045 --> 03:06:30.874]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:06:31.494 --> 03:06:40.996]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:40.996 --> 03:06:46.438]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:06:46.438 --> 03:06:53.919]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:53.919 --> 03:06:56.320]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:07:00.598 --> 03:07:04.780]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:07:04.780 --> 03:07:11.204]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:07:11.204 --> 03:07:18.587]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:07:18.587 --> 03:07:23.130]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:07:23.450 --> 03:07:32.119]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[03:07:32.119 --> 03:07:36.383]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[03:07:36.383 --> 03:07:42.550]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:47.034]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[03:07:47.034 --> 03:07:59.364]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1 to 2 month soap sampler.
[03:07:59.364 --> 03:08:01.626]  Thank you.
[03:08:01.626 --> 03:08:07.031]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.031 --> 03:08:09.293]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:11.109 --> 03:08:24.266]  Interspersed throughout the last 52 minutes of broadcast today, I'm going to hit on other important market news, police state news, military news that I haven't gotten to yet with our guest.
[03:08:24.266 --> 03:08:29.772]  And we're also going to continue with taking some of your phone calls today.
[03:08:31.343 --> 03:08:51.845]  But I've got a lot of calls about this the last four or five months and it certainly is just another good alternative and an idea out there of having state chartered banks that aren't run by offshore banks that create derivatives and then loan it basically to pension funds and governments and private investors.
[03:08:52.486 --> 03:08:56.770]  And to understand that, you've got to identify the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[03:08:56.770 --> 03:08:58.792]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[03:08:58.792 --> 03:09:03.776]  Because the Bank of England is the same system, the EU, Central Bank is the same system.
[03:09:03.776 --> 03:09:14.306]  This is the global private cartel that is taking control of the planet through the fact that they can just create all the money they want for themselves.
[03:09:14.306 --> 03:09:18.850]  All of the assets, all of the credit that they want.
[03:09:20.299 --> 03:09:22.100]  And this is the group setting up world government.
[03:09:22.100 --> 03:09:23.541]  This is the group erasing borders.
[03:09:23.541 --> 03:09:25.863]  This is the group that owns both political parties.
[03:09:25.863 --> 03:09:30.346]  This is the group that runs Goldman Sachs in every major regulatory position.
[03:09:30.346 --> 03:09:31.807]  With the foxes guarding the hen house.
[03:09:31.807 --> 03:09:34.850]  With Elena Kagan saying she wants your free speech.
[03:09:34.850 --> 03:09:36.191]  She wants your guns.
[03:09:36.191 --> 03:09:38.532]  She's a Goldman Sachs member.
[03:09:38.532 --> 03:09:42.735]  And she's written several books.
[03:09:42.735 --> 03:09:45.557]  EllenBrown.com is her website.
[03:09:45.557 --> 03:09:46.938]  She's an attorney.
[03:09:47.979 --> 03:09:51.201]  In Los Angeles, of course, written Web of Debt.
[03:09:51.201 --> 03:09:53.923]  And she also has written some interesting articles.
[03:09:53.923 --> 03:09:57.225]  Cash-starved states need to play the banking game.
[03:09:57.225 --> 03:09:59.806]  North Dakota shows how.
[03:09:59.806 --> 03:10:03.048]  So we'll talk about that state bank.
[03:10:03.048 --> 03:10:04.970]  And here's a quote from Frances Bacon.
[03:10:04.970 --> 03:10:10.293]  He that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils.
[03:10:10.293 --> 03:10:13.475]  For time is the greatest innovator.
[03:10:13.475 --> 03:10:15.816]  And she joins us now.
[03:10:15.816 --> 03:10:16.517]  Thanks for coming on.
[03:10:18.886 --> 03:10:29.313]  Tell us a little bit about yourself for those who just joined us, break down your take on the banking cartel, where we are economically worldwide right now, what you see happening there, and then let's talk about a solution.
[03:10:29.313 --> 03:10:47.865]  It isn't a perfect solution, it won't fix everything, but instead of having a private fellow reserve, I mean even if the Feds won't get control, even if the Congress won't take control of the issuance of currency and credit as they are commanded to in the Constitution, we can move at the state level as part of the states' rights movement to set up state banks.
[03:10:47.865 --> 03:10:48.566]  So let's go through it.
[03:10:49.046 --> 03:11:01.855]  Exactly, that's where I think we have the most opportunity to get a foot in the door at the state level, because Congress is totally bought and paid for by Wall Street.
[03:11:01.855 --> 03:11:04.997]  But the states are desperate.
[03:11:04.997 --> 03:11:12.321]  They have to balance their budgets, unlike the federal government, which is $13 trillion in debt and just keeps going.
[03:11:12.321 --> 03:11:15.023]  I mean, they haven't paid off the federal debt since 1838.
[03:11:17.978 --> 03:11:18.358]  I think so.
[03:11:36.637 --> 03:11:40.240]  And the big central banks are doing the same thing they've done in hundreds of third world nations.
[03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:48.247]  They go in, they get the countries in debt so they can then be economically subservient to the banking cartel that makes the money out of nothing.
[03:11:48.247 --> 03:11:49.848]  And so you have all these unfunded mandates.
[03:11:49.848 --> 03:11:51.289]  The states are going bankrupt.
[03:11:51.289 --> 03:11:52.850]  What does the federal government do?
[03:11:52.850 --> 03:11:54.832]  Even more unfunded mandates.
[03:11:54.832 --> 03:11:58.295]  And then as things go completely bankrupt, the feds just absorb the states.
[03:11:58.295 --> 03:12:04.580]  So the states have got to rebel through their 9th and 10th Amendment powers now or never reverse this.
[03:12:05.563 --> 03:12:06.163]  Right.
[03:12:06.163 --> 03:12:11.186]  All of our money actually is created by banks in the form of loans.
[03:12:11.186 --> 03:12:13.047]  That's my book, Web of Debt.
[03:12:13.047 --> 03:12:17.369]  That's the basic premise, the thing that most people don't realize.
[03:12:17.369 --> 03:12:22.852]  Most people think the government creates money and that it's the government's fault that we have all these troubles.
[03:12:22.852 --> 03:12:27.154]  But if the government did create money, why are they $13 trillion in debt?
[03:12:27.154 --> 03:12:28.555]  In fact, it all comes from banks.
[03:12:29.153 --> 03:12:32.136]  Yeah, Kennedy issued some of our own money and got his head blown off.
[03:12:32.136 --> 03:12:34.858]  The last president to do it, of course, was Lincoln.
[03:12:34.858 --> 03:12:37.020]  For those that don't know, that's a good place to start.
[03:12:37.020 --> 03:12:43.885]  Explain to them how fractional reserve banking works, and now with derivatives, it's not even fractional, they just make up whatever they want.
[03:12:43.885 --> 03:12:44.946]  Right.
[03:12:44.946 --> 03:12:56.536]  Fractional reserve lending goes back to the 17th century, when the goldsmiths would take people's gold for safekeeping, and nobody really wanted to carry around this heavy, dangerous gold.
[03:12:57.492 --> 03:13:02.494]  The Goldsmiths gave them little paper receipts that later evolved into banknotes.
[03:13:02.494 --> 03:13:14.640]  And they soon discovered that they could lend ten times as many banknotes as they actually had gold, because people would only come for their gold ten percent of the time.
[03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:18.042]  So that was the origin of our ten percent fractional reserve system.
[03:13:18.042 --> 03:13:23.065]  We still have the ten percent, even though there's no longer any gold in the system.
[03:13:24.255 --> 03:13:33.422]  Roughly true that people come for their money, come to the bank about 10% of the time and 90% of the time they leave their money in the bank.
[03:13:33.422 --> 03:13:38.707]  So banks are able to leverage their deposits by about a factor of 10.
[03:13:38.707 --> 03:13:44.431]  In other words, they can lend many times more money than they actually have.
[03:13:44.431 --> 03:13:46.973]  And that's how credit is created.
[03:13:46.973 --> 03:13:50.676]  Well, in fact, today banks don't even look at their reserves.
[03:13:50.676 --> 03:13:52.878]  They don't pay any attention to what deposits they have.
[03:13:53.365 --> 03:13:54.405]  When they make a loan.
[03:13:54.405 --> 03:14:03.629]  If a good borrower, say a good client, a corporate client, comes to the bank and wants a loan, the bank just writes it into their account.
[03:14:03.629 --> 03:14:05.850]  And then, it worries about the reserves later.
[03:14:05.850 --> 03:14:12.313]  So, let's say you came in and you wanted a half a million dollar loan to buy a house.
[03:14:12.313 --> 03:14:21.137]  And you would sign a mortgage, and the bank counts that as a negotiable instrument, that's an asset to themselves, because you have promised to pay
[03:14:21.843 --> 03:14:22.283]  That's great.
[03:14:42.813 --> 03:14:47.875]  So that's where the money comes from, that liability where you're allowed to write checks.
[03:14:47.875 --> 03:14:59.280]  That's the origin of all the money that circulates in the economy except for coins, which now compose only one ten thousandth of the total money supply, the M3 money supply.
[03:15:01.545 --> 03:15:19.155]  And as the public begins to learn that gold and silver is real money versus crud paper that's being devalued globally across the board, not just our currency, you're going to see as people rush into gold, its price go up according to all the laws of economics.
[03:15:19.155 --> 03:15:20.936]  Well, true.
[03:15:21.784 --> 03:15:25.127]  And I myself am a heavy believer in gold and silver.
[03:15:25.127 --> 03:15:30.011]  But right now, our entire money system is a series of legal agreements.
[03:15:30.011 --> 03:15:31.372]  There's nothing behind it.
[03:15:31.372 --> 03:15:36.616]  And it's actually not that bad of a system, except for the fact that it's privately owned.
[03:15:36.616 --> 03:15:41.419]  We have private bankers pretending to have money.
[03:15:41.419 --> 03:15:42.600]  That's what Jefferson said.
[03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:50.587]  Thomas Jefferson said, when he figured this out, like 20 years after the Continental Congress, and he figured out that
[03:15:52.092 --> 03:15:53.493]  The first U.S.
[03:15:53.493 --> 03:15:55.735]  bank was just pretending to have money.
[03:15:55.735 --> 03:16:00.538]  So he called them bold and bankrupt adventurers, just pretending to have money.
[03:16:00.538 --> 03:16:10.846]  We had been tricked by them into giving them the power to issue our currency, so that banks still have the power to issue our currency and lend it to us.
[03:16:10.846 --> 03:16:19.072]  But if it were a publicly owned bank, so that the interest went back to the public, then it would be a mathematically
[03:16:20.345 --> 03:16:28.750]  And that's what the Constitution states it should be, but if the Feds won't do it, we're trying to audit the Fed and having more success, we can still go to the state level.
[03:16:28.750 --> 03:16:31.272]  Now here's a quote out of a local paper in North Dakota.
[03:16:31.272 --> 03:16:31.532]  It says,
[03:16:36.175 --> 03:16:39.898]  Known for cold weather, isolated farmers, and the hit movie Fargo.
[03:16:39.898 --> 03:16:45.382]  Yet, for some reason, it defies the real estate cliché of location, location, location.
[03:16:45.382 --> 03:16:53.228]  Since 2000, the state's GMP gross product has grown 56%, personal income has grown 43%, and wages have grown 34%.
[03:16:56.030 --> 03:17:06.497]  This year the state has a budget surplus of 1.2 billion dollars and you believe from your research a lot of that has to do with it having a state bank.
[03:17:06.497 --> 03:17:09.979]  Break that down and explain the difference between a state bank and, say, J.P.
[03:17:09.979 --> 03:17:11.360]  Morgan.
[03:17:11.360 --> 03:17:13.321]  Well, this would be a state-owned bank.
[03:17:13.321 --> 03:17:15.723]  Of course, all states have state banks.
[03:17:15.723 --> 03:17:17.304]  I mean a state-owned bank.
[03:17:17.304 --> 03:17:19.085]  A state-owned bank.
[03:17:19.085 --> 03:17:23.768]  North Dakota is the only state that owns its own bank and it's owned it since 1919.
[03:17:25.607 --> 03:17:29.789]  It was set up under circumstances very similar to what we have today.
[03:17:29.789 --> 03:17:31.029]  It was a populist movement.
[03:17:31.029 --> 03:17:34.291]  The farmers were losing their farms to the Wall Street bankers.
[03:17:34.291 --> 03:17:51.738]  And when they realized that their money was going out of state and that it was actually being fraudulently taken, that the farmers were not being able to sell their perfectly good grain to the granaries, which were a cartel with the railroads, which were a cartel with the banks.
[03:17:51.738 --> 03:17:53.239]  It was all one big cartel.
[03:17:54.247 --> 03:17:54.847]  I don't know.
[03:18:18.660 --> 03:18:32.771]  We could have the same sort of flourishing GDP that they have, but we are all suffering from a credit crisis that was precipitated in Wall Street because the Wall Street Bank got in trouble with their dodgy collateral, etc.
[03:18:32.771 --> 03:18:36.133]  So, North Dakota just escaped all that.
[03:18:36.133 --> 03:18:43.359]  By law, all the state revenues go into the Bank of North Dakota, so they have a huge potential deposit base.
[03:18:44.096 --> 03:18:44.316]  I don't
[03:19:04.253 --> 03:19:04.654]  I don't
[03:19:20.726 --> 03:19:36.952]  Take the state of Texas, takes most of the tax money, invest it in secretive funds and derivatives, and then the comprehensive annual financial reports show they've got a double set of books, and that was okay, though it gave the bankers great power, the private bankers, when the derivatives were on the way up.
[03:19:36.952 --> 03:19:40.254]  But now the states are all bankrupt because the bankers set them up.
[03:19:40.254 --> 03:19:43.095]  They swindled all the tax money investments.
[03:19:44.296 --> 03:19:47.601]  And so now we're defunct just where the bankers wanted us.
[03:19:47.601 --> 03:19:53.489]  So in this big states' rights movement, we need to move to have other states look at state banks.
[03:19:53.489 --> 03:19:58.376]  That is, where the state's money is in a public bank.
[03:19:58.376 --> 03:19:59.017]  Stay there.
[03:19:59.017 --> 03:19:59.578]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:06.633]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:20:06.633 --> 03:20:07.633]  What have we got?
[03:20:07.633 --> 03:20:10.074]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:20:10.074 --> 03:20:11.095]  A republic.
[03:20:11.095 --> 03:20:13.736]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:20:13.736 --> 03:20:15.997]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:20:15.997 --> 03:20:18.018]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:20:18.018 --> 03:20:23.581]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[03:20:23.581 --> 03:20:27.223]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:20:27.603 --> 03:20:31.287]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:20:31.287 --> 03:20:32.568]  You're being warned!
[03:20:32.568 --> 03:20:33.589]  We have the facts.
[03:20:33.589 --> 03:20:34.750]  We have the Constitution.
[03:20:34.750 --> 03:20:35.671]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:20:35.671 --> 03:20:36.552]  We have common law.
[03:20:36.552 --> 03:20:39.074]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:39.074 --> 03:20:42.017]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[03:20:42.017 --> 03:20:42.958]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:20:42.958 --> 03:20:47.922]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:20:47.922 --> 03:20:49.444]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:20:49.444 --> 03:20:50.505]  Don't Tread on Me.

[03:21:05.375 --> 03:21:06.756]  There is a difference.

[03:21:53.976 --> 03:21:54.316]  Good day.
[03:21:54.316 --> 03:21:55.957]  Jim Newcomer from Ritus Resources.
[03:21:55.957 --> 03:21:56.577]  May 20th, 2010.
[03:21:56.577 --> 03:21:57.757]  Gold Open this morning at 1181.70.
[03:22:07.828 --> 03:22:10.929]  One ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.1349, $6.0675 for a half ounce, or $3.0337 for the quarter ounce.

[03:22:11.569 --> 03:22:13.450]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[03:22:13.450 --> 03:22:15.991]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[03:22:28.211 --> 03:22:33.095]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:22:33.095 --> 03:22:36.858]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.

[03:22:59.774 --> 03:23:05.298]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:05.298 --> 03:23:10.621]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:10.621 --> 03:23:12.662]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:12.662 --> 03:23:17.445]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:17.705 --> 03:23:17.925]  I think?
[03:23:36.035 --> 03:23:36.455]  Let's do it!
[03:24:03.587 --> 03:24:08.150]  All right, Ellen, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, but this is so important.
[03:24:08.150 --> 03:24:17.095]  I know it's not basketball or football or getting drunk for new listeners out there that may be tuning in, but it's getting control of our lives.
[03:24:17.095 --> 03:24:21.258]  If we let offshore banks have the power to issue all the currency and credit they want,
[03:24:21.758 --> 03:24:26.644]  They're going to take over, and they have, and announce themselves our rulers and a new empire.
[03:24:26.644 --> 03:24:29.908]  And they're very corrupt, wicked people who also believe in eugenics.
[03:24:29.908 --> 03:24:33.832]  So we must take our states back to get our federal government back.
[03:24:33.832 --> 03:24:37.837]  And the example of North Dakota is a great case point example.
[03:24:38.577 --> 03:24:40.619]  Now, you've written about this in your book.
[03:24:40.619 --> 03:24:43.261]  You've got webofdebt.com.
[03:24:43.261 --> 03:24:45.923]  Let's walk through what a state bank is.
[03:24:45.923 --> 03:24:54.949]  Not a state charter bank, but a bank of the state that's transparent and how this could be rolled out in other states.
[03:24:54.949 --> 03:25:06.498]  In North Dakota, as I mentioned, all of the revenues of the state go into the bank and then those become the deposits, plus they take depositors from individuals.
[03:25:07.068 --> 03:25:08.108]  Or take deposits.
[03:25:08.108 --> 03:25:34.860]  So, you know, the way banking works, the bank just makes loans to anybody it wants to make loans to, but then when the checks go out of the bank, they have to clear through a clearing house, usually the Federal Reserve, but the Bank of North Dakota isn't actually a member of the... Well, I guess they are a member, but they don't have FDIC insurance, and they don't use it.
[03:25:35.731 --> 03:25:39.394]  So anyway, the checks have to clear.
[03:25:39.394 --> 03:25:45.158]  You have to have the same amount going in in the way of deposits as you have going out.
[03:25:45.158 --> 03:25:50.482]  As far as I can see, that's really just a ruse to make it look like you're not creating money on your books.
[03:25:50.482 --> 03:26:02.592]  Because those deposits coming in, like Mr. Smith, the check that just came in, is not the money that Mr. Jones has going out in the form of a check.
[03:26:02.592 --> 03:26:05.574]  In other words, Mr. Smith never said that Mr. Jones could
[03:26:06.032 --> 03:26:06.352]  I don't know.
[03:26:24.209 --> 03:26:35.713]  Well, the goldsmiths discovered 500 years ago that they would hold your gold, because you didn't want to keep it in your house, and then they could give you the receipts, and that no one hardly ever came in at once wanting all their gold.
[03:26:35.713 --> 03:26:38.554]  And even if a few people did, you still had enough, so that's what allowed it.
[03:26:38.554 --> 03:26:49.037]  But explain to people how a state bank like North Dakota has empowers the people, and how it works, and how it's different from the system that the private bankers have.
[03:26:49.813 --> 03:26:54.375]  Okay, in North Dakota, the state bank is actually pretty much a banker's bank.
[03:26:54.375 --> 03:27:00.279]  They do make some commercial loans, but mostly they are partnering with the other banks.
[03:27:00.279 --> 03:27:17.868]  So, where all the other state banks have a capital problem because of the Bank for International Settlement's capital requirement and the fact that they had this dodgy collateral on their books that froze the whole credit mechanism, etc.
[03:27:18.573 --> 03:27:28.901]  It used to be that there were secondary lenders called shadow lenders, the investors, who would buy these collateralized debt obligations, which are bundled mortgages, off the banks.
[03:27:28.901 --> 03:27:36.167]  And then that would clear their books and they could make another set of loans and another set of loans all based on the same capital.
[03:27:36.167 --> 03:27:43.453]  But when those shadow lenders went away, the banks were stuck with the limits of their original capital.
[03:27:43.453 --> 03:27:44.994]  So that froze up credit.
[03:27:44.994 --> 03:27:45.995]  Well, in North Dakota,
[03:27:46.448 --> 03:27:56.356]  The Bank of North Dakota serves as the...it partners with those banks and it takes the loans off their books, making room for more and more.
[03:27:56.356 --> 03:28:09.247]  So, generally, the community banks, the local banks, are dealing directly with customers and then the Bank of North Dakota backstops those banks, rather like the Federal Reserve does.
[03:28:09.247 --> 03:28:10.789]  It's sort of like the mini-Fed.
[03:28:12.375 --> 03:28:16.157]  Yeah, it's the insurance policy, but not just the Bank of North Dakota.
[03:28:16.157 --> 03:28:23.941]  We see local state banks that are private being much more healthy than the big mega banks that created these derivatives.
[03:28:23.941 --> 03:28:33.986]  And under the new bank re-regulation legislation, actually written by Goldman Sachs and others, it allows them to come in and take over the healthy state or regional banks.
[03:28:33.986 --> 03:28:37.328]  So we see a major consolidation taking place here.
[03:28:38.168 --> 03:28:50.974]  Right, so that if you have a state bank, it can help those struggling little banks that are struggling with, now they're talking about raising the capital requirement, they're making it even more difficult for the little local banks.
[03:28:50.974 --> 03:28:53.215]  And so the state bank can help with that.
[03:28:53.215 --> 03:29:00.078]  One major advantage is that all the interest goes back to the state.
[03:29:00.078 --> 03:29:04.260]  So in North Dakota, it's actually a big money maker for the state.
[03:29:04.260 --> 03:29:05.821]  They get a big dividend every year.
[03:29:06.345 --> 03:29:10.309]  So that reduces the amount of taxes that people have to pay.
[03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:16.154]  But plus, it's got a mission statement that is geared toward helping the state.
[03:29:16.154 --> 03:29:21.358]  So where a private bank, like any corporation, has to serve its shareholders.
[03:29:21.358 --> 03:29:25.222]  So if Goldman Sachs can make more money speculating in derivatives,
[03:29:25.788 --> 03:29:31.030]  Then in making commercial loans to businesses that might go bankrupt, they have to speculate.
[03:29:31.030 --> 03:29:32.451]  That's what their business model is.
[03:29:32.451 --> 03:29:35.112]  They have to serve their private shareholders.
[03:29:35.112 --> 03:29:43.195]  And they have lobbyists at the state level getting the state to invest tax money in their system, giving them more power.
[03:29:43.195 --> 03:29:43.675]  Stay there.
[03:29:43.675 --> 03:29:51.779]  Let's come back and talk about how we roll this out in other states and if you're starting to see this being discussed in other states.
[03:29:51.779 --> 03:29:53.179]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.179 --> 03:29:54.680]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.703 --> 03:30:00.964]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:30:05.185 --> 03:30:06.425]  Tyranny is here.
[03:30:06.425 --> 03:30:09.986]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:30:09.986 --> 03:30:12.606]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:30:12.606 --> 03:30:18.468]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:30:18.468 --> 03:30:24.689]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:30:25.129 --> 03:30:31.071]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[03:30:49.076 --> 03:30:51.057]  The police state isn't coming.

[03:33:15.243 --> 03:33:18.730]  I wanted to run over some news headlines here.

[03:33:25.356 --> 03:33:27.899]  And this is directly from the House of Representatives website.

[03:33:29.881 --> 03:33:34.405]  While government treats citizens as terrorists, Mexican military invades U.S.
[03:33:34.405 --> 03:33:35.927]  It is getting crazy right now.

[03:33:49.220 --> 03:33:50.341]  Immigration theater.
[03:33:50.341 --> 03:34:01.611]  Key article by Chrisandra Anderson up at InfoWars.com breaking down how this is really about bringing in a North American Union.
[03:34:01.611 --> 03:34:03.233]  Continuing.
[03:34:03.233 --> 03:34:07.176]  Anarchist group claims Ottawa bank firebombing.
[03:34:07.176 --> 03:34:09.258]  Very serious news on that front.

[03:34:14.505 --> 03:34:19.047]  Obama tells Mexican President, quote, we are not defined by our borders.
[03:34:19.047 --> 03:34:22.168]  More treasonous, treacherous statements.
[03:34:22.168 --> 03:34:27.811]  BP and Coast Guard threatened to arrest journalists for covering oil-polluted shoreline Louisiana.
[03:34:27.811 --> 03:34:29.352]  They did that to CBS News.
[03:34:29.352 --> 03:34:31.092]  Talk about arrogance.
[03:34:31.092 --> 03:34:36.355]  I already mentioned this, but a woman's home confiscated over a small water bill.
[03:34:36.355 --> 03:34:42.918]  Says Valentine lost her two-story brick home after the city sold her debt to investors

[03:34:57.739 --> 03:35:01.141]  I mean, they're taking people's houses now, folks, for $300, okay?
[03:35:01.141 --> 03:35:04.483]  I mean, this country is just in flames.
[03:35:04.483 --> 03:35:12.988]  Meanwhile, dictator of failed state Calderon lectures Americans about freedom, calls for an end to the Second Amendment, and when he addressed Congress today, I mean, this is
[03:35:14.778 --> 03:35:17.541]  Twilight Zone, what's happening?
[03:35:17.541 --> 03:35:18.862]  That's what happens with corruption.
[03:35:18.862 --> 03:35:21.525]  Once it gets to a certain point, it just drops off the edge of the earth.
[03:35:21.525 --> 03:35:24.428]  It just plunges into pure evil.
[03:35:24.428 --> 03:35:29.012]  Bangkok in flames after army storms protest camp, AP.
[03:35:29.012 --> 03:35:33.076]  Bangkok under curfew after fresh anti-government violence.

[03:35:35.489 --> 03:35:35.689]  I don't
[03:35:53.888 --> 03:36:06.261]  The list just goes on and on and on of what is happening in this nation and how things are just deteriorating so quickly as the lawless criminals at every level of government
[03:36:07.383 --> 03:36:10.784]  Just have open season on our Republic.
[03:36:10.784 --> 03:36:12.865]  Here's another one out of the Denver Post.
[03:36:12.865 --> 03:36:16.866]  Douglas County votes to charge fees for school bus rides.
[03:36:16.866 --> 03:36:18.787]  Then you read what it's for.
[03:36:18.787 --> 03:36:25.750]  A $2 million program to make the kids have biometric ID cards they swipe and to GPS the school buses.
[03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:31.712]  So there's no money for the roads and the sidewalks, but there's money for these security companies to set up this prison grid.
[03:36:32.552 --> 03:36:33.613]  Here's another key article.
[03:36:33.613 --> 03:36:37.175]  Feds move to throw pot smokers in prison for impaired driving.
[03:36:37.175 --> 03:36:39.236]  CurtinMoInfoWars.com.
[03:36:39.236 --> 03:36:45.300]  And it actually has a link to the National Drug Policy Strategy saying that they're going to have warrantless blood checkpoints.
[03:36:45.300 --> 03:36:46.580]  You've heard about those.
[03:36:46.580 --> 03:36:50.283]  And that they can find marijuana for up to 100 days.
[03:36:50.283 --> 03:36:51.703]  Generally just 30.
[03:36:51.703 --> 03:36:55.666]  And of any cannabis that over 80% of the public reportedly smokes from time to time.
[03:36:55.666 --> 03:36:58.287]  I guess I'm part of the 20% that rarely smokes pot.
[03:36:58.287 --> 03:36:59.148]  I've smoked it here and there.
[03:36:59.628 --> 03:36:59.929]  I don't know.
[03:37:15.209 --> 03:37:21.392]  At checkpoints and or a cheek swab and if they find THC, prison time!
[03:37:21.392 --> 03:37:23.653]  Prison time!
[03:37:23.653 --> 03:37:28.176]  So you smoked pot a hundred days ago, doesn't matter you're going, you're going to prison.
[03:37:28.176 --> 03:37:28.996]  Here's one, U.S.
[03:37:28.996 --> 03:37:32.098]  states pension funds becoming federal issue.
[03:37:32.098 --> 03:37:36.480]  It talks about state pension funds going bankrupt because they invested them in derivatives.
[03:37:36.480 --> 03:37:41.162]  Don't worry, the feds are going to take it over and only give you part of your money back.
[03:37:41.162 --> 03:37:44.244]  Folks, it's happened everywhere else and it's happening here.
[03:37:45.663 --> 03:37:48.606]  People better get their priorities straight.
[03:37:48.606 --> 03:37:52.130]  Going back to Ellen Brown, the website's webofdebt.com.
[03:37:52.130 --> 03:37:55.895]  She's got a great book out on the subject of the Federal Reserve.
[03:37:55.895 --> 03:38:02.603]  But then another important article, Cash Strap States Need to Play the Banking Game, North Dakota Shows How.
[03:38:02.603 --> 03:38:04.044]  Let's say you were on national news.
[03:38:05.746 --> 03:38:13.409]  Ellen, and you had five minutes to explain this, the basic bullet points, why it's important, what the alternative means, going with the offshore bankers.
[03:38:13.409 --> 03:38:24.594]  I mean, if you had five minutes to just nail it and to crystallize why this is such a great avenue to financial liberty and sovereignty and freedom, what would you say?
[03:38:24.594 --> 03:38:28.016]  Well, we still have a credit freeze in all the states.
[03:38:28.016 --> 03:38:31.497]  And if you own your own bank, you can create credit.
[03:38:31.497 --> 03:38:32.798]  And states have a huge
[03:38:33.444 --> 03:38:57.298]  Deposit and capital base with which they can Leverage their money and create credit so they could fund many things that we think we don't have the money for now like infrastructure and education and low-cost housing Plus the states are paying well in California We're paying an average of four point seven percent interest on our debt if you're a bank banks borrow from each other at the federal funds rate
[03:38:58.894 --> 03:38:59.574]  Of 0 to 0.25%.
[03:38:59.574 --> 03:39:02.777]  That's what the Fed Funds Rate is right now.
[03:39:02.777 --> 03:39:04.978]  So it's an average of something like 0.2%.
[03:39:04.978 --> 03:39:14.405]  So if you're a bank, just for starters, the state could start funding its projects at a very low interest rate.
[03:39:14.405 --> 03:39:22.691]  And we've seen that, well, recently there was a lawsuit for these big banks that were colluding to set prices.
[03:39:22.691 --> 03:39:27.235]  So the states are paying much more than they should be.
[03:39:27.819 --> 03:39:29.339]  We're paying for interest.
[03:39:29.339 --> 03:39:31.940]  Plus, we're subject to the rating agencies.
[03:39:31.940 --> 03:39:38.822]  You know, California, where I live, has a rating that's just hovering above Greece's.
[03:39:38.822 --> 03:39:44.063]  And we, in California, the state has never defaulted on its debt.
[03:39:44.063 --> 03:39:53.006]  And there are the Wall Street banks, which would be bankrupt totally if we, the people, including largely California, hadn't bailed them out.
[03:39:53.720 --> 03:39:59.725]  They are paying this incredibly low interest rate and we're paying a high rate because of our bad credit rating.
[03:39:59.725 --> 03:40:03.127]  So, we could play their game.
[03:40:03.127 --> 03:40:11.294]  In other words, we can step into their shoes and get all the perks that a bank gets by being a bank.
[03:40:11.294 --> 03:40:13.735]  Continue.
[03:40:13.735 --> 03:40:19.820]  Well, I had started to explain about how banks create money.
[03:40:19.820 --> 03:40:20.341]  When a bank
[03:40:21.919 --> 03:40:37.251]  First it creates money on its books, and then the check goes out of the bank, and then it has to clear, and if the bank doesn't have the deposits to make it clear, then it just borrows that money back from the other banks, and it borrows at 0.2% interest.
[03:40:37.251 --> 03:40:43.176]  So essentially what it does is it creates money, the money goes out, and it borrows that very same money back.
[03:40:43.176 --> 03:40:47.940]  In other words, the pool has enough money out there because it just created it and put it out into the pool.
[03:40:48.496 --> 03:40:53.340]  It borrows that same money back at 0.2% interest if that's funds raised.
[03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:58.985]  Or, you know, 1 point something if they're taking longer CDs or whatever.
[03:40:58.985 --> 03:41:01.428]  But still, it's a very low interest rate.
[03:41:01.428 --> 03:41:09.755]  And then they re-lend that to the state at, like, California, 4.7% or to individuals at 6% or something.
[03:41:09.755 --> 03:41:13.118]  Or on credit cards up to 30% or whatever it is.
[03:41:13.118 --> 03:41:14.960]  So they're getting this huge spread.
[03:41:15.780 --> 03:41:20.883]  And if you own the bank, then that spread becomes taxpayer money.
[03:41:20.883 --> 03:41:24.566]  I mean, it goes back into the pool and feeds the pool.
[03:41:24.566 --> 03:41:28.168]  You had mentioned about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[03:41:28.168 --> 03:41:39.075]  I was asked to speak at a government finance officer's convention about a month ago in Missouri, so I had a chance to talk to all these finance officers.
[03:41:39.075 --> 03:41:42.738]  And they said, indeed, that they had these huge rainy day pools
[03:41:43.308 --> 03:41:50.893]  There were anywhere from 20% to 75% of their budget that they had to sock away in this rainy day funding.
[03:41:50.893 --> 03:42:01.500]  The reason was that unlike banks, which have this infinite credit line and can borrow anytime they want, states, they can't borrow.
[03:42:01.500 --> 03:42:05.282]  You know, they have to go to the voters and do a bond issue.
[03:42:05.282 --> 03:42:09.505]  It's a big laborious process and it's never certain whether it's even going to happen.
[03:42:09.505 --> 03:42:11.686]  They don't know if they're going to be able to auction off their bonds.
[03:42:12.386 --> 03:42:23.172]  So it's actually happened in Missouri there, where a city would just come to a standstill, like there would be no money for anything, and the city would stop because they didn't plan their budgets correctly.
[03:42:23.172 --> 03:42:27.754]  So just to make sure, they stock away all this money in rainy day funds.
[03:42:27.754 --> 03:42:29.355]  Well, you can't.
[03:42:29.355 --> 03:42:29.795]  You can't.
[03:42:29.795 --> 03:42:38.359]  Like in California, I know that Treasurer manages $70 billion in a Treasurer's pool of this sort of rainy day fund.
[03:42:40.017 --> 03:42:40.738]  We're good to go.
[03:43:01.673 --> 03:43:18.438]  Well to interrupt, it's basically all rigged to the big mega-banks and now they've taken over society and NAFTA and GATT has destroyed our industrial base and now to cover this breaking news, and we'll continue with you in a moment ma'am, world stocks tumble as debt woes rumble on.
[03:43:19.278 --> 03:43:22.701]  And the more trillions the bankers get, the worse things get, the less they loan.
[03:43:22.701 --> 03:43:24.302]  This is their system.
[03:43:24.302 --> 03:43:35.170]  World markets fell sharply once again Thursday as sentiment continued to be hit by concerns about the continent's debt crisis and figures showed an unexpected increase in U.S.
[03:43:35.170 --> 03:43:37.272]  jobless claims last week.
[03:43:37.272 --> 03:43:42.576]  The worries left most of the world's leading indexes now trading below where they were in 2010.
[03:43:44.520 --> 03:43:46.101]  At the start of 2010.
[03:43:46.101 --> 03:43:53.986]  In Europe, the FTSE 100 Index of leading British shares closed down 84.95 points, or 1.7%, at 5,073.13, while Germany's DAX slid to 120.79 points, or 2%, to 5,867.88.
[03:43:53.986 --> 03:43:56.227]  The CAC 40 in France ended 79.15 points, or 2.3% lower.
[03:44:11.357 --> 03:44:11.617]  I think?
[03:44:31.517 --> 03:44:32.278]  Or, 2.3% to 1,089.99.
[03:44:32.278 --> 03:44:44.605]  The Euro debt crisis continued to be the main point of interest and the markets and fears are growing that it may prove to be the catalyst to a renewed downturn in global growth.
[03:44:44.605 --> 03:44:46.086]  There has been no growth.
[03:44:46.086 --> 03:44:48.487]  If not an outright slide back into recession.
[03:44:48.487 --> 03:44:50.008]  We've never been out of the recession, folks.
[03:44:50.008 --> 03:44:52.329]  Three quarters of recession is depression.
[03:44:52.329 --> 03:44:57.252]  While stocks tank, oil prices slid below $70 a barrel, the 10-year U.S.
[03:44:57.252 --> 03:44:59.013]  Treasury yields dropped to a 2010 low.
[03:45:00.954 --> 03:45:07.439]  Sentiment is awful and confidence has been trashed, said David Buick, markets analyst at BGC Partners.
[03:45:07.439 --> 03:45:14.164]  I mean, the issue here is, folks, it's only going to get worse, like we told you two years ago in the last stage crisis.
[03:45:14.164 --> 03:45:14.485]  Okay?
[03:45:14.485 --> 03:45:17.687]  The stimulus money is only spent on sweetheart insiders.
[03:45:17.687 --> 03:45:19.949]  This is a criminal consolidation.
[03:45:19.949 --> 03:45:22.251]  We have the internal emails of Goldman Sachs.
[03:45:23.484 --> 03:45:31.074]  Either they are brought to justice and kicked out of our country, along with Calderon saying this is Mexico and he wants our guns.
[03:45:31.074 --> 03:45:36.280]  Either we wake up and get angry, which is starting to happen, or we become debt slaves.
[03:45:36.280 --> 03:45:37.001]  And they'll do it.
[03:45:37.001 --> 03:45:38.143]  They're experts at it.
[03:45:38.143 --> 03:45:40.205]  They know how to bring you down into financial slavery.
[03:45:40.706 --> 03:45:42.968]  They know how to put a police state in to suppress you.
[03:45:42.968 --> 03:45:44.229]  They've done it hundreds of times.
[03:45:44.229 --> 03:45:50.995]  This is hard core information and everything is unfolding according to their program.
[03:45:50.995 --> 03:45:56.340]  But the awakening is bigger than they thought it would be and Brzezinski and others are starting to panic.
[03:45:59.821 --> 03:46:10.389]  Knowing how this system works, Alan Brown, and it's one thing to know it's coming, it's another thing to now see it here, and to know where we're going from this point, straight down.
[03:46:10.389 --> 03:46:16.334]  Being a lawyer, researcher, author on the Federal Reserve, I mean, do you ever have a sense of unrealness yourself?
[03:46:16.334 --> 03:46:19.397]  Because I know I feel like that, that it's just so incredible
[03:46:20.057 --> 03:46:33.980]  The earth-shaking events that are happening right now, and the public's somewhat awake, but if they had any idea just how horrific this is, I think they'd be even more awake and more angry, because I've talked to so many yuppies who say, I'm glad the Euro's plunging, that'll help us.
[03:46:33.980 --> 03:46:35.421]  No, we're going down too.
[03:46:35.421 --> 03:46:38.121]  We're all under the same global system.
[03:46:38.121 --> 03:46:41.042]  And people just live in denial about this.
[03:46:41.042 --> 03:46:47.624]  I don't think people understand, this is the beginning of the implosion, as bad as it is.
[03:46:47.624 --> 03:46:49.364]  We ain't seen nothing yet, as they say.
[03:46:50.896 --> 03:46:58.122]  The book, Web of Debt, the theme of it is the Wizard of Oz, and that's the whole idea that nothing is what we think.
[03:46:58.122 --> 03:47:07.129]  Actually, the Wizard of Oz was written as a monetary allegory in the 1890s, when they had a big populist movement for money reform, which is what I think we need to do today.
[03:47:07.129 --> 03:47:13.434]  They almost won, and now we've seen a hundred years later that the bankers have messed everything up.
[03:47:13.434 --> 03:47:17.658]  It is time for us to step in and take back our government by
[03:47:18.846 --> 03:47:28.535]  Taking back the money power, we have lost the power to issue our own money and our own credit, and that's where we lost our government.
[03:47:28.535 --> 03:47:34.241]  In the case of the Euro, all those countries, they're all in debt.
[03:47:34.241 --> 03:47:36.463]  Now how is that possible if they're all in debt?
[03:47:36.463 --> 03:47:40.747]  It's because they're in debt to bankers, which create their money and lend it to them.
[03:47:41.528 --> 03:47:50.619]  And it's designed, the bankers brag, as a black hole to consolidate the small banks, to bankrupt the states, the nations.
[03:47:50.619 --> 03:47:54.723]  It is designed to give them total power.
[03:47:54.723 --> 03:48:02.352]  That's right, and the head is the Bank for International Settlements, which is now tightening the screws even more by talking about
[03:48:03.055 --> 03:48:09.177]  Well, the way the bankers in general have kept a tight rein on economies is by contracting the money supply.
[03:48:09.177 --> 03:48:12.738]  So they never allow enough money to be out there to run the whole economy.
[03:48:33.149 --> 03:48:34.970]  And therefore, people have to borrow.
[03:48:34.970 --> 03:48:45.434]  And that starts this whole pyramid, or Ponzi scheme, where you have to have more and more borrowers to support the money supply.
[03:48:45.434 --> 03:48:59.879]  So, you could say that the Bank for International Settlements is responsible for all this, but this whole collapse, this whole recent collapse, in 1988, they imposed Basel I, their first capital requirement.
[03:48:59.879 --> 03:49:02.420]  And at that time, the Japanese banks were the biggest
[03:49:02.984 --> 03:49:03.404]  We're good to go.
[03:49:29.471 --> 03:49:33.634]  They could keep them alive, so Japan has never recovered from that.
[03:49:33.634 --> 03:49:45.464]  But we avoided it, our Wall Street banks avoided it, by getting into this whole securitization thing, where the banks would bundle up loans and sell them off to investors.
[03:49:45.464 --> 03:49:47.445]  Well, they didn't just survive, they got more power.
[03:49:47.445 --> 03:49:50.668]  That was their next phase to economically destroy the West.
[03:49:50.668 --> 03:49:50.948]  Right.
[03:49:50.948 --> 03:49:58.254]  Well, then when they no longer were even going to have the loans on their books, they didn't care what was in these loans, because it wasn't going to be their problem.
[03:49:59.709 --> 03:50:12.417]  And then they sold those as AAA-rated, certifying pure garbage.
[03:50:12.417 --> 03:50:13.798]  This has been an amazing interview.
[03:50:13.798 --> 03:50:16.780]  I look forward to having you back on in the future.
[03:50:16.780 --> 03:50:17.320]  Ellen Brown.

[03:50:26.806 --> 03:50:28.007]  But in the last 30 seconds,
[03:50:29.682 --> 03:50:32.283]  How long do you think it'll be until they fully implode the U.S.
[03:50:32.283 --> 03:50:34.685]  publicly?
[03:50:34.685 --> 03:50:41.669]  Well, I'm hoping that we can, what we need to do is set up our own independent credit system and then we can avoid that.
[03:50:41.669 --> 03:50:51.174]  If we set up our own, a better mousetrap, then we can let all those, the big banks and the derivatives team, etc., collapse and we will have our own funding mechanism.
[03:50:52.051 --> 03:50:52.471]  You know what?
[03:50:52.471 --> 03:50:53.992]  Do a minute or two on the other side with us.
[03:50:53.992 --> 03:51:02.294]  I want to ask you that question about, are other states looking at the Bank of North Dakota model?
[03:51:02.294 --> 03:51:04.175]  Don't answer it!
[03:51:04.175 --> 03:51:11.937]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[03:51:55.190 --> 03:51:56.892]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:51:56.892 --> 03:51:59.073]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:51:59.073 --> 03:52:01.815]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:52:09.100 --> 03:52:14.221]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:14.221 --> 03:52:18.722]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:18.722 --> 03:52:21.082]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:21.082 --> 03:52:23.623]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:23.623 --> 03:52:26.864]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:26.864 --> 03:52:34.465]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:34.805 --> 03:52:40.106]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:40.106 --> 03:52:43.047]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:43.047 --> 03:52:46.728]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:46.728 --> 03:52:49.149]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[03:52:49.149 --> 03:52:50.649]  Invisible Empire.

[03:54:04.196 --> 03:54:10.841]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:54:10.841 --> 03:54:13.824]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:16.107 --> 03:54:22.929]  They went after Ron Paul in 2007-2008 saying he was a racist with no evidence.
[03:54:22.929 --> 03:54:23.989]  Just made up.
[03:54:23.989 --> 03:54:29.190]  And now they say if you're against government health care you're a racist or you want sovereignty you're a racist.
[03:54:29.190 --> 03:54:30.851]  And it's not going to work with Rand Paul.
[03:54:30.851 --> 03:54:32.931]  But the neocons are attacking him.
[03:54:32.931 --> 03:54:34.752]  Rachel Maddow is attacking him.
[03:54:34.752 --> 03:54:39.413]  We've got a key article up at PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson.
[03:54:39.413 --> 03:54:44.194]  Desperate establishment launches baseless racist attack on Rand Paul.
[03:54:46.878 --> 03:54:47.199]  I don't
[03:55:02.176 --> 03:55:04.177]  Talk about the State Bank of North Dakota.
[03:55:04.177 --> 03:55:09.098]  I'm hearing a lot of talk about trying to get legislation for the states to save themselves.
[03:55:09.098 --> 03:55:14.780]  We know the states have a big appetite for Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment powers right now, and there's a big awakening.
[03:55:14.780 --> 03:55:19.401]  Are we seeing any movement towards other states setting up their own banking system?
[03:55:19.401 --> 03:55:23.583]  Yes, there are actually five states that have bills pending.
[03:55:23.583 --> 03:55:29.665]  Three of them with full-blown bills that talk about where they're going to get the capital deposits.
[03:55:29.665 --> 03:55:30.585]  That would be Michigan,
[03:55:31.164 --> 03:55:44.727]  Illinois and Washington State, and then two other states that are proposing to study such a bill, and then the three other states besides that where they've discussed it in the legislature and they're talking about doing bills.
[03:55:44.727 --> 03:55:48.308]  And there are eight candidates from all different persuasions.
[03:55:48.308 --> 03:55:56.530]  I think there's three Democrats, two Republicans, two Greens, and one Independent that are all including it in their
[03:55:57.571 --> 03:56:01.634]  So this is really starting to gain steam thanks to your work and others out there.
[03:56:01.634 --> 03:56:05.936]  Let me guess, the Federal Reserve lobbyists are against this?
[03:56:05.936 --> 03:56:09.919]  I really haven't heard anyone be against it.
[03:56:09.919 --> 03:56:13.181]  I did see one objection in the Detroit News.
[03:56:13.181 --> 03:56:19.205]  Somebody said that Detroit didn't have $150 million, which is what they were proposing for their capital base.
[03:56:19.205 --> 03:56:21.786]  But that's what I started to say about that capital money.
[03:56:21.786 --> 03:56:26.069]  The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the Rainy Day Fund.
[03:56:26.553 --> 03:56:31.574]  You could tap up that money as your capital base, even though you can't spend it, you can invest it.
[03:56:31.574 --> 03:56:35.555]  So you could invest that money as capital in a bank, or pension funds.
[03:56:35.555 --> 03:56:41.376]  You know, they invest in equity, stock equity, so they could do it.
[03:56:41.376 --> 03:56:52.278]  You know, Joseph Stiglitz said that $700 billion that was put up for bailing out the banks, what they should have done was use that $700 billion as the capital for a bank.
[03:56:53.033 --> 03:56:59.979]  Yeah, but that gives people control of their own lives and makes government sovereign, and we don't want that.
[03:56:59.979 --> 03:57:04.503]  Of course, he's a two-time Nobel Prize winner, one of the prizes for economics.
[03:57:04.503 --> 03:57:06.305]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:57:06.305 --> 03:57:06.765]  Thank you.
[03:57:07.679 --> 03:57:08.520]  You bet.
[03:57:08.520 --> 03:57:14.825]  Yeah, we're slaves of the bankers, and there's a global rebellion, an awakening happening against these people.
[03:57:14.825 --> 03:57:19.669]  And they'll distract you with a Republican-Democrat, black versus white, all this other stuff.
[03:57:19.669 --> 03:57:24.033]  They'll make movies like Machete to glorify race war, to try to get us fighting with each other.
[03:57:25.094 --> 03:57:26.955]  Painted as liberal.
[03:57:26.955 --> 03:57:28.996]  It's nothing but divide and conquer.
[03:57:28.996 --> 03:57:35.720]  And clearly, the people are now beginning to understand that we better defeat the New World Order or none of us have any future.
[03:57:35.720 --> 03:57:38.481]  These people are ruthless and they're not going to back off.
[03:57:38.481 --> 03:57:39.942]  And stock markets are plunging.
[03:57:39.942 --> 03:57:44.724]  The global financial crisis right now is even worse than what was happening two years ago.
[03:57:44.724 --> 03:57:46.645]  It's a continuation of the same thing.
[03:57:46.645 --> 03:57:48.987]  I want to say great job to the crew today.
[03:57:48.987 --> 03:57:50.147]  We'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
