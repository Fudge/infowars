[00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.791]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:18.433]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:22.556]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.678]  It is Friday, the 23rd day of July 2010.
[00:00:24.678 --> 00:00:30.324]  For the next 30 minutes, we have an exclusive interview with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:37.130]  Of course, with his hit TV show now going into its second season, they're producing Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.711]  He has had trouble all over the country.
[00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:49.779]  Most of this we can't talk about because it's the TV show, but now the harassment, the Homeland Security surveillance has gotten so bad that the governor wants to talk about this pattern here today.
[00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:54.162]  And we're very honored that he contacted us yesterday to give us this exclusive.
[00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:57.705]  I'm also playing my own part in the show as a consultant.
[00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:04.950]  But the headline at InfoWars.com by Curt Nemo, exclusive, Jesse Ventura talks with Alex Jones about government harassment of his TV show.
[00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.731]  And it is really intensifying.
[00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:07.972]  Governor, thank you for joining us.
[00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:09.673]  Hi Alex, great to be here.
[00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:16.236]  And again, I come on the air with you, Alex, just to inform the public out there of exactly what's going on with our U.S.
[00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:17.416]  government, it seems.
[00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:20.018]  Well, we appreciate you coming here first, sir.
[00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:25.460]  Well, you know, ABC or NBC or none of them are going to air what I'm going to talk about.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.541]  You can bet on that.
[00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:28.782]  And I know that this is a place where freedom speaks.
[00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:34.195]  Have you had a chance to see the ABC News story that tries to make a joke about the harassment?
[00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:38.198]  It says Jesse Ventura brings his conspiracy theories to the Capitol.
[00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:43.721]  No, I didn't look at it, but you know what they always say in the entertainment world, any publicity is good.
[00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:45.922]  Absolutely, as long as they get your name right.
[00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:51.365]  Governor, break down the latest or the history of this, wherever you'd like to start.
[00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:56.965]  I'm good to go.
[00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:24.687]  Very humble of simply me standing in front of the eternal flame at Arlington National Cemetery.
[00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:27.067]  No talking, no anything.
[00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:32.229]  And bear in mind Kevin Costner did it in JFK.
[00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.810]  They filmed him there.
[00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.591]  Well, we went to this character, this Ken Hawes, who's the U.S.
[00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:44.504]  And he denied it, and wouldn't let me do it.
[00:02:44.504 --> 00:02:46.205]  We did it anyway, though, Alex.
[00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:47.306]  We got the shot.
[00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:51.950]  In fact, the security people there were very helpful, and they even moved people out of the way.
[00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.792]  So obviously it didn't filter to the guy on the ground.
[00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:59.216]  This was happening in the upper echelon, trying to do it the correct way.
[00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:04.320]  But I went to my Congresswoman, Michelle Bachmann, immediately, and I said, what is this?
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.821]  And she got outraged.
[00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:07.563]  She said, you have First Amendment rights.
[00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.294]  Let me read what happened real quickly here.
[00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:15.658]  On July 22, 2010, we called back and asked to speak with Mr. Haas.
[00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:19.242]  We were told that Mr. Haas was in Chicago filming blah blah blah.
[00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:29.474]  Nevertheless, the gentleman we spoke with said that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Haas and said they considered the topic of your particular episode inappropriate.
[00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:37.774]  After receiving Mr. Haas' cell phone number, we called him in Chicago to find out why you were not allowed to film at Arlington National Cemetery.
[00:03:37.774 --> 00:03:44.576]  According to Mr. Haas, Arlington National Cemetery has a policy of prohibiting stand-up filming.
[00:03:44.576 --> 00:03:51.318]  Additionally, Mr. Haas stated that you were denied in part because of the nature of your television program.
[00:03:52.098 --> 00:04:06.328]  Specifically, he stated the topic of your particular episode, which alleges that the United States government was directly involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[00:04:06.328 --> 00:04:09.811]  Now, first of all, we don't say that in the episode.
[00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:11.532]  The episode isn't even finished.
[00:04:11.532 --> 00:04:13.093]  How would this guy know it, Alex?
[00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:16.816]  How would he know at all what position we were taking on this?
[00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:18.197]  We were merely investigating it.
[00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.489]  We're good to go.
[00:04:44.853 --> 00:04:48.214]  Pick your brain about some of the other things that have happened, but expand on this.
[00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:55.257]  But what a dangerous precedent where the government says you can't film at national parks unless we agree with your message.
[00:04:55.257 --> 00:04:58.838]  Since when is the army running this country internally?
[00:04:58.838 --> 00:05:00.499]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.280]  You've heard me talk about Caledon 5-star subs for years.

[00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:50.764]  Thank you!
[00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:01.817]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[00:06:01.817 --> 00:06:07.120]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.901]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:13.583]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:19.585]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[00:06:23.787 --> 00:06:29.210]  It contains two weeks of delicious easy-to-fix food along with the equipment to prepare it.
[00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.291]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:36.693]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:42.035]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:45.877]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[00:06:45.877 --> 00:06:47.898]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week

[00:07:55.398 --> 00:07:57.138]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:07.289]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:10.271]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:14.608]  Again, it's Friday, July 23, 2010.
[00:08:14.608 --> 00:08:17.749]  Governor Jesse Ventura joins us live from California.
[00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:29.532]  The last few days he was in D.C., part of a pattern of the government trying to block his First Amendment rights and selectively doing this for people's political or views, period, just on the country.
[00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:38.235]  Governor, for those who just joined us, recap what's happened, get more into what Congresswoman Bachman is saying and the Army trying to block you from a national park.
[00:08:38.815 --> 00:08:39.736]  Well, what happened?
[00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:53.383]  We're doing a show on the murder of John F. Kennedy, and apparently the Army doesn't like it, and they're in charge of Arlington National Cemetery, and the gentleman's name is Ken Hawes, spelled H-A-W-E-S.
[00:08:54.343 --> 00:08:59.564]  For those listeners out there that are as outraged as I am, I'll give you his phone number.
[00:08:59.564 --> 00:08:59.645]  310-235-7621.
[00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:00.445]  Again, 310-235-7621.
[00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:13.588]  We're good to go.
[00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:46.524]  Because of the nature of your television program.
[00:09:46.524 --> 00:10:04.809]  Specifically, he stated, the topic of your particular episode which alleges that the United States government was directly involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:09.510]  So now the Army bureaucrats are deciding what Americans can do inside the country?
[00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:14.660]  Apparently, or they have control over what you can film.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.603]  I was a governor, a mayor, I'm a U.S.
[00:10:17.603 --> 00:10:20.405]  Navy Vietnam veteran.
[00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:22.306]  John Kennedy was a Navy man.
[00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:28.551]  I'll bet you if President Kennedy could speak out on this, he would be more than happy to let me film at his eternal flame.
[00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:39.492]  Well the issue is I've seen the news many times filmed there and as you mentioned it's in many films and documentaries and the film JFK which is saying it was a government operation.
[00:10:39.492 --> 00:10:52.417]  So they're clearly discriminating against you and it just shows this atmosphere of government control where the government's involved in productions of movies, where the army will try to block people even interviewing people in the military.
[00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:55.278]  You know what the bottom line is Alex?
[00:10:56.278 --> 00:10:59.281]  These people are supposed to work for us.
[00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:00.782]  We pay their salaries.
[00:11:00.782 --> 00:11:02.364]  It's called paying your taxes.
[00:11:04.508 --> 00:11:18.616]  That's what irks me a great deal, is the fact that I pay this guy's salary, and yet he has the ability to deny me from getting photographed by whom I consider the greatest president in my lifetime?
[00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:21.798]  At his eternal flame?
[00:11:21.798 --> 00:11:25.900]  Because he happens to not like the content of my program?
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.201]  And where we're going?
[00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:32.244]  Because some of us believe the Warren Commission's a crock of you-know-what?
[00:11:32.244 --> 00:11:32.524]  You know?
[00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:36.907]  And we still seek the truth, even today.
[00:11:36.907 --> 00:11:42.549]  By the way, on another subject, she wouldn't go on air with me.
[00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:47.811]  It's kind of the same subject, but I did sit down with Marina Oswald for two and a half hours.
[00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:49.271]  Wow, tell us about that.
[00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:54.433]  Well, you know, she wouldn't go on the air, but I think the most dynamic thing was this.
[00:11:54.433 --> 00:11:55.674]  She said this to me, Alex.
[00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:58.034]  She said, nobody cares anymore.
[00:11:58.034 --> 00:12:02.296]  And I tried to convince her that yes, we do, because this is the cornerstone of corruption.
[00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:07.038]  If they can kill the President and get away with it, then they can do anything.
[00:12:07.038 --> 00:12:14.602]  And I said, it's important that history and we learn the truth no matter how delayed it is, if indeed that we've been lied to.
[00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:20.325]  And she looked me right in the eye, and she said, would you sacrifice your children for the truth?
[00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:36.214]  Well, it doesn't mean she's necessarily being threatened, but it means that certainly she feels that there is still a threat out there that if maybe she spoke out
[00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:36.814]  We're good to go.
[00:12:59.565 --> 00:12:59.765]  Everything!
[00:13:24.052 --> 00:13:29.977]  Everything we look into, Alex, the government behaves like they're guilty of hiding something.
[00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:38.804]  Let me put it to you this way, and I won't say where I was, but I've now been tailed and put on by Homeland Security.
[00:13:38.804 --> 00:13:41.486]  I've been tailed by the Coast Guard.
[00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:44.548]  And we don't do anything illegal, Alex.
[00:13:44.548 --> 00:13:46.950]  Everything we do on the show is above board.
[00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:53.315]  We try to go through proper channels, and we simply, if something requires us to go on the water,
[00:13:53.775 --> 00:14:05.384]  We do it in international waters, or waters that are supposed to be free to the public, but yet we tried to hire a boat, and when they found out what we wanted to do, none of the fishermen would take us out.
[00:14:05.384 --> 00:14:07.206]  You know why?
[00:14:07.206 --> 00:14:16.693]  Because anybody on the coast now, their licenses fall under Homeland Security, and Homeland Security can pull their license if they don't like what they're doing.
[00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:19.796]  I like to refer to Homeland Security today as the Gestapo.
[00:14:21.923 --> 00:14:22.884]  Well, absolutely.
[00:14:22.884 --> 00:14:25.387]  You've got almost every major federal agency under it.
[00:14:25.387 --> 00:14:32.055]  And now under the REAL ID Act, they want you to have to have a federally licensed through the state ID card to even be able to work.
[00:14:32.055 --> 00:14:34.678]  It's a total tracking system.
[00:14:34.678 --> 00:14:39.003]  And you also went somewhere where you were threatened to be shot.
[00:14:40.188 --> 00:14:49.775]  Well, yeah, they have areas in the country where they have signs up that say lethal force is authorized, which I find unbelievable.
[00:14:49.775 --> 00:14:58.921]  Whatever happened to a trial, whatever happened to going to court, you know, how can you be judged purely in execution and one fails fruit?
[00:14:58.921 --> 00:15:07.667]  Now, I'm not saying that they necessarily have or did, but there's areas in this country where it's posted that lethal force is authorized if you cross this line.
[00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:13.350]  And there's not even a fence, it's just you cross some magical line on a dune buggy, you're dead.
[00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:16.567]  Well, you could be.
[00:15:16.567 --> 00:15:21.351]  It's not saying that you are, but they're authorized to take you out with lethal force if they desire.
[00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:40.667]  Well, Governor, I mean, as you know, in 1947, the CIA got unlimited money, funding, and secrecy, and if you've got 60 years of a group being able to operate with unlimited funds and power, I mean, they've been caught shipping in narcotics, they've been caught engaging in assassinations, and they just think this country is their own private whorehouse.
[00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:46.954]  Well, you know, and unfortunately our elected officials are allowing them to get away with it.
[00:15:46.954 --> 00:15:56.345]  You know, we need to, you know, get back our country and remember always, Alex, that we the people, when this country was formed, we were supposed to be the priority.
[00:15:57.344 --> 00:16:01.267]  It was supposed to be a country of citizens first, government second.
[00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:02.687]  But it's not that way today.
[00:16:02.687 --> 00:16:11.273]  Government is number one, and we citizens fall by the wayside because everything is directed towards the government and the survival of the government.
[00:16:12.062 --> 00:16:29.212]  Governor, I know you've been busy shooting, but earlier in the week, Top Secret USA came out, two-year Washington Post investigation, 850-plus thousand private corporate chiefs, that's close to a million, with the highest level security clearance there is.
[00:16:29.212 --> 00:16:32.514]  And the Washington Post described it as a complete takeover of society.
[00:16:32.514 --> 00:16:36.297]  So we have a private corporate system that's giving itself government power.
[00:16:36.977 --> 00:16:38.738]  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.
[00:16:38.738 --> 00:16:41.399]  I said that probably about 10 years ago.
[00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:53.403]  I said, the Internet right now is the only thing where you can, you know, have total freedom on there.
[00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:58.445]  But I said, rest assured, the government will put high priority on getting control of the Internet.
[00:16:59.305 --> 00:17:05.689]  Because that's the one place you can go to, supposedly, and have freedom, and they're not going to allow that.
[00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:20.717]  You know, more and more I'm seeing our country becoming under the thumb of corporate America, not even... Well, it's like, you know, it came out in the article that I said, I now am very clear on why we're in Afghanistan, Alex.
[00:17:20.717 --> 00:17:25.560]  It has nothing to do with terrorism and Bin Laden, that's all a big red herring.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.021]  We're there for the lithium.
[00:17:28.188 --> 00:17:33.550]  Did you see that story a month ago where they found $8 billion of lithium over there?
[00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.671]  I mean, think about it.
[00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:39.313]  That runs every cell phone, computer, and soon-to-be electric cars.
[00:17:39.313 --> 00:17:41.954]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:17:41.954 --> 00:17:44.175]  The only good word in Afghanistan is to get the lithium.
[00:17:44.175 --> 00:17:46.816]  Now, why won't they just be honest and say that?
[00:17:48.626 --> 00:17:56.151]  Well, they went on to admit that it could be potentially a trillion dollars, and that they knew this in reports before they invaded.
[00:17:56.151 --> 00:18:00.334]  It's also about the trillions in oil in that region as well.
[00:18:00.334 --> 00:18:03.396]  Right, you know, and that's the reason we're there.
[00:18:03.396 --> 00:18:10.020]  All this stuff on terrorism, put it this way, terrorists are like a motorcycle gang.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:15.664]  You know, they're out there, yes they do exist, and there is a possibility that you could run into them very minute.
[00:18:16.664 --> 00:18:21.166]  But they are not what this government is making us believe.
[00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:23.286]  They are not like the Nazi Army.
[00:18:23.286 --> 00:18:26.807]  They are not like the Japanese Army of World War II.
[00:18:26.807 --> 00:18:28.288]  They're not a country out there.
[00:18:28.288 --> 00:18:34.330]  They're just small groups of criminals that are involved in criminal activity and you have to deal with them.
[00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:40.252]  But to put our country under lock and key and take our rights away from us.
[00:18:41.582 --> 00:18:49.507]  Absolutely, and every major technology firm out there is getting massive government contracts to spy on the American people.
[00:18:49.507 --> 00:18:52.628]  They've completely butchered the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:18:52.628 --> 00:18:55.390]  All these groups have the motive for the terror.
[00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.551]  They stand to gain from it.
[00:18:56.551 --> 00:19:09.958]  Did you see the Financial Times of London with one of Obama's advisors, Robert Shapiro, saying of if, in fact guys print that quote for me, that if Obama doesn't have an Oklahoma City or 9-11 soon, his political
[00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:14.982]  Well, how would Oklahoma City or 9-11 help him?
[00:19:14.982 --> 00:19:15.422]  Well, okay.
[00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:30.293]  Well, all I know, Alex, is that, you know, I fully expect within 10 years that we're going to have to have national ID cards and you're going to have to show them to go state to state.
[00:19:38.118 --> 00:19:42.344]  Oh, they're already saying that we've got a national ID card and they do want you to have it for anything.
[00:19:42.344 --> 00:19:48.152]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest host of the hit television program Conspiracy Theory.
[00:19:48.152 --> 00:19:48.893]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:48.893 --> 00:19:51.256]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are our websites.
[00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:52.157]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:52.538]  Stay with us.
[00:19:59.059 --> 00:20:08.284]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:20:08.284 --> 00:20:11.846]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:21.431]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:20:21.431 --> 00:20:26.674]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[00:20:26.974 --> 00:20:42.429]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance, and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold, and guns, with absolutely no apologies.
[00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:43.210]  And the best part?
[00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:47.054]  This $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[00:20:47.054 --> 00:20:47.494]  That's right.
[00:20:47.654 --> 00:20:48.035]  We're good.
[00:21:01.155 --> 00:21:06.918]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:06.918 --> 00:21:19.005]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:19.005 --> 00:21:27.270]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.952]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:21:31.826 --> 00:21:47.998]  Now I'm offering 50 all organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:21:47.998 --> 00:21:50.720]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.164]  I'm Big John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.731]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:11.915]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:17.237]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[00:22:17.237 --> 00:22:20.218]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[00:22:28.701 --> 00:22:29.962]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:29.962 --> 00:22:34.525]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:34.525 --> 00:22:40.329]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:40.329 --> 00:22:43.971]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:43.971 --> 00:22:46.693]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.693 --> 00:22:51.756]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:24:03.035 --> 00:24:05.777]  Alright, folks, final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:09.279]  Don't forget, the film's now being censored online.
[00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:15.302]  The Obama Deception and, of course, Fall of the Republic, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:15.302 --> 00:24:19.025]  Since I mentioned it, top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:30.532]  Financial Times of London, the bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in Obama's leadership, said Shapiro, adding, he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence as short of an
[00:24:31.332 --> 00:24:35.696]  9-11 event, or an Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think of how he can do that.
[00:24:35.696 --> 00:24:37.717]  Governor Ventura, is that chilling?
[00:24:37.717 --> 00:24:39.398]  Well, unbelievable.
[00:24:39.398 --> 00:24:48.305]  I mean, that they talk about that an event has to take place to have confidence in your president, what, that he can fight a war, that we have the strongest military in the world?
[00:24:48.305 --> 00:24:49.246]  We've already proven that.
[00:24:49.246 --> 00:24:56.352]  You know, I just find it outrageous that someone would say that, and what they'll do for political gain.
[00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.231]  Well, it's very brazen.
[00:24:58.231 --> 00:25:01.175]  They think we're a bunch of idiots to be talking like that openly.
[00:25:01.175 --> 00:25:07.744]  Governor, in closing, let's talk about the issue of the First Amendment and give out that number one more time.
[00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:13.290]  We're good to go.
[00:25:40.302 --> 00:25:43.044]  Take pictures of it and live with it?
[00:25:43.044 --> 00:25:51.509]  And then it goes on to say, uh, uh, additionally, Mr. Hall stated that you were denied in part because of the nature of your television program.
[00:25:51.509 --> 00:26:04.997]  Specifically, he stated the topic of your particular episode, which alleges the United States government was directly involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[00:26:06.155 --> 00:26:10.338]  Now, first of all, Alex, they didn't know what's in my show.
[00:26:10.338 --> 00:26:14.961]  My show hasn't aired yet, so they're simply assuming what's in there.
[00:26:14.961 --> 00:26:18.743]  And then they're denying me because of the content of the show.
[00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:27.488]  John Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, and if you don't go along with the official story, you are not allowed to film at his eternal flame.
[00:26:27.488 --> 00:26:28.269]  If I guess if you...
[00:26:28.829 --> 00:26:29.509]  We're good to go.
[00:26:54.465 --> 00:27:02.367]  Well, Governor Jesse Ventura, if we don't hang together, we'll certainly hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:08.469]  Separately on this issue, though, you said that Michelle Bachmann, the Congresswoman from your state, is very upset about this.
[00:27:08.469 --> 00:27:15.511]  We need to have an investigation, or, I mean, pretty soon the military will tell us how to wipe our noses.
[00:27:15.511 --> 00:27:20.373]  Exactly, and what's the military doing inside our country telling us things like that?
[00:27:20.373 --> 00:27:21.533]  The U.S.
[00:27:21.533 --> 00:27:22.694]  military is supposed to protect us.
[00:27:27.688 --> 00:27:28.248]  We're good.
[00:27:37.028 --> 00:27:38.669]  And your book covers a lot of this.
[00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:43.251]  It's so jam-packed, American Conspiracies, and incidentally, it's available at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:43.251 --> 00:27:48.073]  You can get a free film of your choice when you get the book, American Conspiracies, at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:48.073 --> 00:27:50.774]  It just covers basically all the key issues.
[00:27:50.774 --> 00:27:56.677]  I think it's Jesse Ventura's best book and is a New York Times Top Ten bestseller.
[00:27:56.677 --> 00:27:58.878]  We've only got about two minutes left, Gov.
[00:27:58.878 --> 00:28:05.841]  So much is happening, but it sounds like this second season is even more adventure and action-packed than the last one.
[00:28:06.161 --> 00:28:07.343]  I think it's going to be.
[00:28:07.343 --> 00:28:10.107]  It certainly is being more adventurous in doing it.
[00:28:10.107 --> 00:28:18.481]  I guess we were under the radar the first year we did it, but now it's aired on TV, so we've obviously gotten the attention of the United States government.
[00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:19.662]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:23.593]  And what, eight to ten episodes this season?
[00:28:23.593 --> 00:28:25.714]  Yeah, eight for sure, and possibly ten.
[00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:27.375]  We're doing eight for sure.
[00:28:27.375 --> 00:28:43.062]  We've almost completed half of them now, so half of them are just about ready to go into the editing room and be put together into a final form, and then we got the other four to do before October, and it should be on the air, I'm guessing, around mid-October sometime.
[00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:46.310]  That is, Alex, unless Mr. Haas has something to say about it.
[00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.531]  I'm sure if they ask for his input, my show will be censored and not allowed on television.
[00:28:49.531 --> 00:28:49.851]  I don't know.
[00:28:49.851 --> 00:28:50.211]  You tell me.
[00:28:50.211 --> 00:28:54.632]  To me, they're overreaching their bounds dramatically, and this Ken Haas guy should be relieved of whatever his duty is.
[00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:12.963]  Well, we talked last time, a month or so ago, about an awakening.
[00:29:12.963 --> 00:29:18.747]  I am seeing an awakening, so I hope the pendulum starts really swinging against all this tyranny.
[00:29:18.747 --> 00:29:19.327]  Me too.
[00:29:19.327 --> 00:29:20.488]  Alex, I gotta run.
[00:29:20.488 --> 00:29:24.471]  You take care, and I'll keep in touch, and I'll let you know anything else that goes on.
[00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:27.613]  Alright, Governor Jesse Ventura, thanks for keeping us abreast of the situation.
[00:29:27.613 --> 00:29:29.554]  Thanks for defending the First Amendment.
[00:29:29.554 --> 00:29:30.255]  Take care.
[00:29:30.255 --> 00:29:30.615]  Okay.
[00:29:30.615 --> 00:29:31.395]  Goodbye, Alex.
[00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:34.677]  Alright, there goes Governor Jesse Ventura, about to go do a big interview on his JFK.
[00:29:35.918 --> 00:29:56.028]  Investigation we appreciate him contacting us and giving us this exclusive breakdown of what's going on with the production There's a lot more happening behind the scenes, but I'm not at liberty to talk about it But it'll be coming out on the TV show in the fall stay with us We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[00:30:03.013 --> 00:30:04.274]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:07.796]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:07.796 --> 00:30:10.438]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:10.438 --> 00:30:16.301]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:22.525]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:22.965 --> 00:30:28.907]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:28.907 --> 00:30:33.129]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:33.129 --> 00:30:37.410]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:43.353]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:43.353 --> 00:30:46.914]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:46.914 --> 00:30:48.895]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:48.895 --> 00:30:49.315]  It's here.

[00:30:58.737 --> 00:31:02.920]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:09.325]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:31:09.325 --> 00:31:16.711]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:31:16.711 --> 00:31:21.595]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:31:52.574 --> 00:31:53.034]  Thank you!
[00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:04.297]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.297 --> 00:32:13.160]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.781]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:17.781 --> 00:32:28.604]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:29.244 --> 00:32:38.752]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:38.752 --> 00:32:44.196]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:44.196 --> 00:32:51.682]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:51.682 --> 00:32:54.444]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:19.542 --> 00:33:35.095]  I'm going to get into a bunch of news right now before I go any further.
[00:33:35.095 --> 00:33:45.763]  This radio show, our news websites, everything we do at Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, all of it is having a bigger and bigger effect and we are
[00:33:46.949 --> 00:33:49.410]  Targets of the establishment we are being demonized.
[00:33:49.410 --> 00:34:04.314]  We are being attacked in in many ways That I'm looking at revealing in the next week or so here on air, and I'm not sure I've been having to talk to counsel about it like I was doing that this morning, but We've always wanted to have a big effect.
[00:34:04.314 --> 00:34:09.956]  We wanted to try to save this Republic save this nation But
[00:34:11.886 --> 00:34:13.147]  Things are getting so real.
[00:34:13.147 --> 00:34:14.147]  I mean, you know that.
[00:34:14.147 --> 00:34:35.616]  There is a quickening happening, and I want to thank everyone who has made our work here possible, who have made PrisonPlanet.tv and the websites and the radio show and the films possible, and I want to encourage everybody, now more than ever, to get all the different books and videos and materials we carry at InfoWars.com, because your purchase supports us financially and allows us to do what we do, but that's really secondary.
[00:34:35.616 --> 00:34:39.478]  The main mission is waking people up, and the American people need to see Fall of the Republic.
[00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:45.190]  And Invisible Empire, New Lord Defined, and of course, the Obama deception.
[00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.630]  The system does not want you to see this information.
[00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:58.272]  They do not want you to go to prisonplanet.tv and to download my films and to burn them to disk and to give them to everyone you know, because the truth is contained in these documentaries.
[00:34:58.272 --> 00:35:02.193]  And it's having a really big effect.
[00:35:02.193 --> 00:35:05.793]  It's having a giant effect right now.
[00:35:05.793 --> 00:35:08.474]  And we need to continue what we're doing and expand it.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:17.007]  Because Rack and Ruin is where we're going if we don't reverse what's happening in this world.
[00:35:17.007 --> 00:35:21.811]  And we know if we lay down and do nothing, the bad guys are going to win.
[00:35:21.811 --> 00:35:29.198]  I shot a video a few days ago that we posted titled, The Road, an Allegory for Life.
[00:35:33.783 --> 00:35:43.012]  Gotten tens of thousands of views, but I wanted to get hundreds of thousands and then millions subsequently because I think it's some of the most eloquent information I've ever laid out.
[00:35:43.012 --> 00:35:47.155]  So I would encourage everybody to go to our YouTube channel and to get that video for everybody.
[00:35:47.155 --> 00:35:49.558]  In fact, guys, will you pull that video up?
[00:35:49.558 --> 00:35:51.920]  The road and allegory for life.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:58.185]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPanda.com and on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube.
[00:35:58.185 --> 00:35:58.586]  What was that?
[00:36:01.465 --> 00:36:05.007]  In fact, I had meant to air that today and then I'd forgotten that I wanted to air that.
[00:36:05.007 --> 00:36:16.055]  So we're going to play that coming up here in just a few minutes because it ties into the film The Road, but also ties into everything else we face as a society.
[00:36:16.055 --> 00:36:22.940]  I mean, we openly have the NSA running around
[00:36:24.426 --> 00:36:32.893]  Spying on everything we do and giving corporate governance, governmental power over our society.
[00:36:32.893 --> 00:36:38.117]  This is absolutely untenable.
[00:36:38.117 --> 00:36:41.619]  And it's something that we must resist and face up to.
[00:36:41.619 --> 00:36:45.943]  We know real tyranny when we're facing it.
[00:36:45.943 --> 00:36:48.585]  We know what bonafide tyranny and corruption is.
[00:36:51.656 --> 00:37:06.662]  And it is a very strange feeling to be here on air and to know that of all the people out there fighting the New World Order, we're in the top two or three organizations.
[00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:11.403]  It's amazing to know that all of this is going on and all of this is happening.
[00:37:11.403 --> 00:37:17.186]  Were you guys able to find it?
[00:37:17.186 --> 00:37:17.886]  Are we ready for it?
[00:37:20.299 --> 00:37:25.000]  All right, I'm gonna go ahead and play this clip, this video clip, The Road, an allegory for life.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:42.683]  We'll come back and hit some very important top stories, but here it is.
[00:37:42.683 --> 00:37:49.344]  I recently had a chance to watch the film, The Road, based on the novel by Carmack McCarthy.
[00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:55.871]  And to say that this film is a masterwork is an understatement.
[00:37:55.871 --> 00:38:01.454]  This is probably the most powerful film I have ever seen.
[00:38:01.454 --> 00:38:05.636]  And it has so many different messages that operate on so many different levels.
[00:38:05.636 --> 00:38:11.979]  It has archetypal snapshots from things that have happened throughout human history.
[00:38:11.979 --> 00:38:15.461]  And it really is a story about the good guys versus the bad guys.
[00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:22.773]  And how tyranny and barbarism is the great enemy of civilization and humanity.
[00:38:22.773 --> 00:38:26.917]  And how love is such a wonderful virtue.
[00:38:26.917 --> 00:38:35.023]  And that it isn't until times of great adversity that we see the worst and the best in humankind being expressed.
[00:38:35.023 --> 00:38:39.547]  It made me think of a Victor Hugo quote from the French philosopher.
[00:38:39.547 --> 00:38:41.048]  Adversity makes men
[00:38:41.849 --> 00:38:44.010]  And another quote by John Quincy Adams.
[00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:48.532]  Being a student of history, this dystopic near future film was very unsettling.
[00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:06.600]  I don't have nightmares about Big Brother coming to get me.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.401]  I don't have nightmares about my children dying in car wrecks.
[00:39:10.401 --> 00:39:12.261]  I don't really have nightmares.
[00:39:12.261 --> 00:39:15.602]  And I've been having very disquieted dreams.
[00:39:15.602 --> 00:39:19.383]  I wouldn't even call them nightmares since watching this film.
[00:39:19.383 --> 00:39:24.924]  Because I have studied Leningrad and the close to a million people that died in that siege.
[00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:30.706]  And the years of cannibalism that sustained the population under the Nazi onslaught.
[00:39:31.608 --> 00:39:38.173]  I have studied what happened, of course, in Rome and during the different phases of its collapse.
[00:39:38.173 --> 00:39:43.658]  I've looked at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the hundreds of thousands killed by the A-bombs at the end of World War II.
[00:39:48.039 --> 00:39:51.682]  And this film has a pro-Second Amendment message.
[00:39:51.682 --> 00:39:54.805]  I mean, if you don't have a gun during this collapse, you're in deep trouble.
[00:39:54.805 --> 00:40:06.074]  I've seen that Hollywood meme of victim disarmament being pushed over and over again where you always see these horror movies and things where nobody's got guns to fight back against the killer, which is just asinine.
[00:40:06.074 --> 00:40:16.623]  It never really telegraphs that message of how important the gun is and how it could be used in the hands of bad people for oppression or in the hands of the good guys to protect themselves and their family.
[00:40:17.043 --> 00:40:31.800]  But the overall message in this film is intense love and commitment and the love that a parent can only have for their children and really a growing experience that you have that's built into us in our very genetic code.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:32.340]  Yes.
[00:40:53.450 --> 00:41:01.115]  And then if you love your children today, don't you love your unborn great-great-great-grandchildren just as much if you could hold them in your arms?
[00:41:01.115 --> 00:41:07.398]  Why then would you go along with illegal wars of aggression like Iraq and Afghanistan?
[00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:15.383]  Why would we accept the new good guys on shows like 24 torturing people's children in front of their parents to get answers?
[00:41:15.383 --> 00:41:19.246]  Why are we basically being dehumanized by design?
[00:41:20.046 --> 00:41:29.103]  And the modern system that we're all living under right now is a form of creeping death, where the social engineers literally traffic in our psyches, in our souls.
[00:41:31.332 --> 00:41:42.217]  And people have lost their empathy and their humanity and they've been made so envious and jealous and so self-centered that they lose the greater sense of community.
[00:41:42.217 --> 00:41:54.802]  And we are literally submersed in toxins and additives and GMO, all of which on record have been designed to reduce our fertility and to cause increases in cancers.
[00:41:54.802 --> 00:41:56.603]  And the entire world population
[00:41:57.803 --> 00:42:19.925]  Uh is fascinated now with catastrophe and collapse films because at a subconscious level the subconscious mind is much more powerful than the conscious mind and the human computer knows that humanity is in a crisis on so many levels but we can't recognize it because it's not a truck coming over a hill you know with 15 cannibals in the back that are planning to butcher you and your son
[00:42:20.626 --> 00:42:42.577]  It is a scientific corporate board that analyzes future trends and that tracks everything we're doing to where they can not just predict the future in mass movement or individual movement now with Google NSA type software, but they can also guide the future and create false trends through the Madison Avenue PR machine.
[00:42:42.577 --> 00:42:45.218]  And so we're losing our human destiny.
[00:42:45.218 --> 00:42:48.000]  We're losing our connection to the land.
[00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:51.599]  We're losing everything that makes us human.
[00:42:52.654 --> 00:43:21.675]  I mean, it is a horrific thing to have all these government textbooks and documents that we cover on the show where they admit they're poisoning the water, they're poisoning the food, sperm counts are down by over 80% in the Western world, to know that HIV was a genetically engineered bioweapon, to know that they are purposefully adding mercury to the corn syrup, to know that they're feeding GMO crops to animals that is causing them to become sterile, and it's passing on these chemical toxins to humans, to know that the
[00:43:22.755 --> 00:43:31.100]  Bt corn that grows its own natural pesticide is wiping out the bees and then in all the studies it's causing massive organ failure in lab rats.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:42.908]  Folks that is even much more horrific than this nightmare dystopic film that has perfectly presented one spectrum of human collapse and it also has some global warming propaganda in it.
[00:43:43.508 --> 00:43:43.868]  I think?
[00:44:03.283 --> 00:44:14.835]  Became semi-dormant and was not putting off any Coriolis solar flares and so that the earth itself has actually cooled in the last decade.
[00:44:14.835 --> 00:44:17.798]  It was heating up and that that cooling trend.
[00:44:18.459 --> 00:44:24.043]  And that ionizing radiation that forms cloud nuclei has not been there in the last decade.
[00:44:24.043 --> 00:44:25.984]  And so the atmosphere began collapsing.
[00:44:25.984 --> 00:44:28.766]  Thank God the sun just flared back up.
[00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:34.110]  We now know that giant asteroids hit the Earth conservatively every few hundred thousand years.
[00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.592]  And it's the same with mega volcanoes like the one in Yellowstone.
[00:44:37.592 --> 00:44:42.095]  We know it's not happening every 10 or 15 million years like scientists previously thought.
[00:44:42.095 --> 00:44:46.338]  We know that the sun is not stable.
[00:44:46.338 --> 00:44:48.079]  That it cools off and heats up.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:57.698]  We know that we are living on a tiny little blue-green jewel floating through space way out in the boondocks.
[00:44:57.698 --> 00:44:59.762]  And then when you read the globalist plans...
[00:45:01.018 --> 00:45:07.761]  Where they openly want to destroy the family and basically mechanize humanity and turn us into basically biological androids.
[00:45:07.761 --> 00:45:16.524]  You realize that the threat in the short term isn't asteroids, it's not global warming, but that it is the elite with their open-air genetic engineering.
[00:45:16.524 --> 00:45:28.249]  I mean, I just saw last week a major university study with this new salmon they've approved that within controlled conditions they did tests and that the genetically engineered chimera, it's a cross species, it's only part fish,
[00:45:29.332 --> 00:45:44.450]  Extincted the other salmon within 40 generations and that's 40 generations in the open sea We know that they've for over a decade have part spider part goat chimera creatures genetic Mutations that create body armor in their milk.
[00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:47.773]  We know that the major GMO companies aren't just coming out with eight
[00:45:48.436 --> 00:45:57.808]  Major food crops but hundreds and hundreds and that they are literally rewriting the genetic code of the planet and they don't even care if it has dangerous implications.
[00:45:57.808 --> 00:46:06.460]  The real threat is this scientific elite that has literally walled off humanity in a kind of arrested development
[00:46:07.805 --> 00:46:16.449]  And they write about this, and the establishment, in articles written by Bill Joy and others, have openly discussed the fact of, do the elites even need humanity?
[00:46:16.449 --> 00:46:18.970]  Or are we garbage that has to be taken out?
[00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:28.975]  And you read the official United Nations plans to reduce the world population by at least 80%, and you realize that this entire world government, in their own words, is being built as a kill grid.
[00:46:28.975 --> 00:46:35.238]  And what's crazy is, it's so horrific, even though it's publicly available information, the average person can't face it.
[00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.231]  Once you've seen The Road, you'll understand what I'm about to say.
[00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:42.151]  But it totally resonated.
[00:46:42.151 --> 00:46:43.352]  We all know Veritas.
[00:46:43.352 --> 00:46:45.972]  We know truth because it's something that was already in us.
[00:46:45.972 --> 00:46:55.015]  And we see it as self-evident when another fellow human being has experienced and thought the same thoughts you're having, but just from a different perspective.
[00:46:55.015 --> 00:46:58.115]  And that these men and women could come together and make this film.
[00:46:58.115 --> 00:47:00.216]  That this author could write this book.
[00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:00.956]  Okay.
[00:47:12.341 --> 00:47:20.008]  It lets you understand how important goodness is, and love, and honor, and family, and self-defense.
[00:47:20.008 --> 00:47:21.750]  Are you with the good guys?
[00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:23.051]  Or are you with the bad guys?
[00:47:23.051 --> 00:47:25.873]  And do you carry that fire inside you?
[00:47:25.873 --> 00:47:32.439]  That even as we're becoming nihilistic and more and more evil, and even as people look around them and say, everybody else is evil, I'm gonna be evil.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.921]  It's saying, no, I'm going to carry the fire in myself.
[00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:36.862]  I'm going to be good.
[00:47:36.862 --> 00:47:38.323]  I'm going to try to be pure.
[00:47:38.323 --> 00:47:39.703]  I'm going to try to be loving.
[00:47:39.703 --> 00:47:41.564]  I'm going to try to be honorable.
[00:47:41.564 --> 00:47:44.486]  It doesn't mean any of us are perfect, but you're striving.
[00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:47.647]  You're carrying that fire inside of you.
[00:47:47.647 --> 00:47:58.753]  And so I salute the filmmakers and I salute everybody else who sees this film and is touched by it because this is truly the greatest masterwork in filmmaking that I have ever seen.
[00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:03.352]  Okay, that's my review of The Road.
[00:48:03.352 --> 00:48:07.093]  If you want to send that out to folks, because it has a lot of key issues laced in it.
[00:48:07.093 --> 00:48:09.354]  It's The Road, an allegory for life.
[00:48:09.354 --> 00:48:11.415]  Just search that term and you'll find it.
[00:48:11.415 --> 00:48:12.816]  An allegory for life, The Road.
[00:48:12.816 --> 00:48:14.436]  Okay, here's some news.
[00:48:14.436 --> 00:48:18.018]  I'm going to come back and get into two pulled from playing over 9-11 video.
[00:48:18.018 --> 00:48:23.540]  This gets into the hysteria and mind control and the attack on any free speech of any type.
[00:48:25.555 --> 00:48:26.035]  U.S.
[00:48:26.035 --> 00:48:28.857]  forces step up Pakistan presence.
[00:48:28.857 --> 00:48:32.299]  The Washington Wall Street Journal reports.
[00:48:32.299 --> 00:48:35.220]  The Wall Street Journal, not the Washington Post.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:38.362]  And it just shows how these wars are all being expanded everywhere.
[00:48:38.362 --> 00:48:40.583]  Just like Vietnam started with advisers.
[00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:42.224]  That's how this is starting.
[00:48:42.224 --> 00:48:50.548]  The Jerusalem Post reports, Navy braces for Lebanese flotilla set to try to break the blockade in the next week.
[00:48:50.548 --> 00:48:54.270]  The flotilla of 13 ships, and of course they've
[00:48:54.878 --> 00:48:55.138]  I think?
[00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:15.383]  Iran's government's calling for harsh responses.
[00:49:15.383 --> 00:49:20.728]  Anybody that tries to board their ships in the Persian Gulf, so that's escalating the provocations on that front.
[00:49:20.728 --> 00:49:33.419]  Of course, the last few days you've heard all the media talking about Congress, of any institution in the United States, has the lowest approval rating of any institution and that it's continuing into freefall.
[00:49:33.419 --> 00:49:38.183]  That's because Congress goes against the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the will of the people.
[00:49:38.183 --> 00:49:40.325]  It's an illegitimate criminal group, on average.
[00:49:41.045 --> 00:49:48.610]  The majority of these people are a bunch of global stooges in there just helping carry out the bank robbery of the American people.
[00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:52.152]  So there is a major awakening taking place on that front.
[00:49:52.152 --> 00:49:53.453]  There is some good news.
[00:49:53.453 --> 00:49:56.294]  Dems pulled plug on climate bill.
[00:49:56.294 --> 00:49:58.096]  Now they claimed this a few months ago, but now
[00:49:59.036 --> 00:50:02.119]  The campaigning is getting so heavy that it looks like it may be true.
[00:50:02.119 --> 00:50:07.182]  Biden announced today that their legislative agenda is over.
[00:50:07.182 --> 00:50:12.587]  They've gotten their new financial dictatorship passed in the name of reform and that now the campaigning must begin.
[00:50:14.192 --> 00:50:17.054]  And of course they're using the race card right now on both sides.
[00:50:17.054 --> 00:50:22.657]  Republicans and Democrats are having race war volleys in the political arena.
[00:50:22.657 --> 00:50:24.558]  But Dems pulled the plug on the climate bill.
[00:50:24.558 --> 00:50:28.220]  Senate Democrats pulled the plug on the climate legislation yesterday.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:38.085]  Pushing the issue off into an uncertain future ahead of midterm elections where President Obama's party is girding for a drumming.
[00:50:38.085 --> 00:50:42.188]  But leaked G20 documents show carbon tax is still high on Globalist's list.
[00:50:43.183 --> 00:50:51.951]  That's from the Corbett Report, linked up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, so they're going to try to pass that at your city, county, and state level.
[00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:53.992]  We'll come back and into some other key news straight ahead.
[00:50:53.992 --> 00:50:54.413]  Stay with us.
[00:50:59.949 --> 00:51:04.552]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:59.454 --> 00:52:04.417]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:04.417 --> 00:52:05.418]  What have we got?
[00:52:05.418 --> 00:52:07.859]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:07.859 --> 00:52:08.880]  A republic.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.522]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:11.522 --> 00:52:13.783]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:13.783 --> 00:52:15.804]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:15.804 --> 00:52:17.485]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:17.485 --> 00:52:18.806]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:18.806 --> 00:52:19.406]  Children?
[00:52:19.406 --> 00:52:20.547]  Our education?
[00:52:20.547 --> 00:52:21.368]  Our money?
[00:52:21.368 --> 00:52:25.030]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:30.356]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:31.377]  We have the facts.
[00:52:31.377 --> 00:52:32.538]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:32.538 --> 00:52:33.460]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.341]  We have common law.
[00:52:34.341 --> 00:52:36.864]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:36.864 --> 00:52:39.807]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:52:39.807 --> 00:52:40.628]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:40.748 --> 00:52:45.692]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:45.692 --> 00:52:47.193]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:47.193 --> 00:52:48.273]  Don't tread on me.

[00:52:59.639 --> 00:53:03.180]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.480]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.340]  Don't!
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.781]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:53:09.781 --> 00:53:16.903]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:53:16.883 --> 00:53:18.863]  's number one debt secret.
[00:53:18.863 --> 00:53:22.524]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[00:53:33.456 --> 00:53:34.637]  Herb K was right.
[00:53:34.637 --> 00:53:37.681]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:53:37.841 --> 00:53:39.101]  What do you have to lose?
[00:53:39.101 --> 00:53:40.322]  Stop the calls now.
[00:53:40.322 --> 00:53:42.282]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:53:42.282 --> 00:53:42.862]  Get Herb K.'

[00:53:46.583 --> 00:53:46.643]  800-405-7850.
[00:53:46.643 --> 00:53:48.144]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:53:48.144 --> 00:53:49.804]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:07.955 --> 00:54:10.517]  This next story illustrates so many things.
[00:54:10.517 --> 00:54:12.779]  It shows the fear, the hysteria.
[00:54:12.779 --> 00:54:17.102]  It's government invoked of 9-11 attacks.
[00:54:17.102 --> 00:54:22.667]  Two people were pulled for watching clips of the 9-11 attacks.
[00:54:22.667 --> 00:54:24.989]  Probably 9-11 truth videos.
[00:54:24.989 --> 00:54:26.070]  Remember when Virgin Atlantic?
[00:54:27.042 --> 00:54:27.902]  We're good to go.
[00:54:47.188 --> 00:54:57.053]  from their Orlando-bound flight before takeoff from Toronto's Pearson Airport after another passenger spotted them watching video of the 9-11 terror attacks.
[00:54:57.053 --> 00:55:03.157]  I wish that passenger would spot the big central banks robbing us or would spot all the police state stuff happening.
[00:55:03.157 --> 00:55:06.619]  QMI agency columnist Joe Warmington on his way to
[00:55:07.998 --> 00:55:20.445]  Cover the Conrad Black story in Florida was on the same plane when another passenger alerted the flight crew after they spotted the young boy, oh he's definitely dangerous, watching video on his iPod of planes smashing in the World Trade Center.
[00:55:20.445 --> 00:55:26.168]  So the media can show this all the time, but you can't be watching it on your iPad or iPhone.
[00:55:26.168 --> 00:55:27.789]  It's just citizens that are bad.
[00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:35.533]  Just before the plane took off for US airspace, Air Canada officials confirmed that the sun
[00:55:36.877 --> 00:55:44.062]  of the two passengers, a man and a boy, were watching the video of the 9-11 attacks before flight AC922 departed Tuesday night.
[00:55:44.062 --> 00:55:51.186]  Other passengers and crew became concerned, Air Canada spokesman Patrick Fitzpatrick told The Sun Wednesday.
[00:55:51.186 --> 00:55:56.150]  The passengers were deplaned following an investigation allowed to travel Wednesday morning.
[00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:57.971]  They were allowed, isn't that nice?
[00:55:57.971 --> 00:55:59.071]  Safety and security are
[00:55:59.872 --> 00:56:06.835]  As well as comfort of all our passengers and crew is always our top concern, and we take whatever steps we need necessary to provide a safe, secure, comfortable environment.
[00:56:06.835 --> 00:56:13.857]  The Air Canada employee told Washington, Warmington, that the first man tried to cover up the video when staff tried to talk to him.
[00:56:13.857 --> 00:56:16.318]  Ooh, even more evil.
[00:56:16.318 --> 00:56:17.619]  It made everyone nervous.
[00:56:17.619 --> 00:56:18.559]  Oh, yes.
[00:56:18.559 --> 00:56:22.000]  The employee said adding the entire incident may have been a coincidence.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.482]  I don't know if it was the right decision, the employee said, but better safe than sorry.
[00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:26.442]  Yes.
[00:56:26.442 --> 00:56:28.383]  Live in a Stasi thought crime system.
[00:56:29.636 --> 00:56:38.591]  Peel Regional Police constituency, constabulary, Samantha Newell said officers assisted the airline with the complaint meeting.
[00:56:39.537 --> 00:56:42.039]  The two passengers at the gate when they were taken off the plane.
[00:56:42.039 --> 00:56:45.881]  Investigators found no criminal offense had taken place, she said.
[00:56:45.881 --> 00:56:49.584]  Newell said that she couldn't confirm the two were watching 9-11 scenes.
[00:56:49.584 --> 00:56:51.445]  The two were cleared of all allegations.
[00:56:51.445 --> 00:56:52.826]  Allegations of what?
[00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:55.588]  And set out on the next flight, she said.
[00:56:55.588 --> 00:56:59.050]  The terror video scare wasn't the only delay on the flight that day.
[00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.832]  Oh, there was lots of hysteria and fear going on.
[00:57:01.832 --> 00:57:08.997]  Passengers were told missing baggage was delaying the plane's takeoff even before they were told there would be a further delay due to the security problem.
[00:57:09.457 --> 00:57:17.204]  So it's just a ninnying society of being naked body scanned with radiation and checkpoints and army and kids being trained to tattle on their parents.
[00:57:17.204 --> 00:57:24.250]  I see articles every week or two, stories where some high school student will write a fiction story.
[00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:33.779]  Usually there's some A student who's done nothing wrong and they'll write a story about zombies or war and doesn't even involve the school and they get arrested because of what they wrote.
[00:57:38.871 --> 00:57:43.752]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:49.314]  Passenger Mike Burrard told Toronto Businessman, told that the whole thing was scary.
[00:57:49.314 --> 00:57:51.054]  It was a scary ordeal.
[00:57:51.054 --> 00:57:54.015]  This was definitely the strangest flight of my career, he said.
[00:57:54.015 --> 00:57:59.577]  Oh my gosh, there was some missing baggage and then there was a kid watching a 9-11 video.
[00:57:59.577 --> 00:58:00.657]  Oh my gosh, I mean...
[00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:07.518]  Meanwhile, there's poisons in almost all the major processed foods items on record by design.
[00:58:07.518 --> 00:58:10.663]  The government's poisoning the water supply on record.
[00:58:10.663 --> 00:58:14.209]  All these diseases like cancer, you name it, are exploding.
[00:58:14.209 --> 00:58:16.492]  And we're going into a depression worldwide.
[00:58:19.053 --> 00:58:21.394]  The public just cling to the legs of the stewardess.
[00:58:21.394 --> 00:58:23.596]  Let's save me!
[00:58:23.596 --> 00:58:24.977]  It was a child.
[00:58:24.977 --> 00:58:27.218]  It was a 9-11 video.
[00:58:27.218 --> 00:58:28.979]  This is the modern mind control.
[00:58:28.979 --> 00:58:32.081]  It's the same hysteria they use to demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:58:32.081 --> 00:58:34.583]  Some old man seen cleaning their gun in their garage.
[00:58:34.583 --> 00:58:35.383]  The police get called.
[00:58:35.383 --> 00:58:37.365]  The old man has their guns taken.
[00:58:37.365 --> 00:58:37.805]  Stay with us.
[00:58:37.805 --> 00:58:41.367]  King Info coming up.
[00:58:41.367 --> 00:58:43.989]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.989 --> 00:58:46.370]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.939 --> 00:58:53.481]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:53.481 --> 00:58:54.402]  Number 1.
[00:58:54.402 --> 00:58:57.823]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:57.823 --> 00:58:58.683]  Number 2.
[00:58:58.683 --> 00:59:03.586]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:03.586 --> 00:59:04.326]  It's true.
[00:59:04.326 --> 00:59:09.188]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:09.188 --> 00:59:10.029]  Number 3.
[00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:13.610]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:17.312]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:17.512 --> 00:59:18.313]  Number 4.
[00:59:18.313 --> 00:59:21.076]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:21.076 --> 00:59:24.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.540]  Number 5.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:29.705]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:29.705 --> 00:59:34.450]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:59:45.556 --> 00:59:46.956]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:46.956 --> 00:59:52.940]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:01.322 --> 01:00:02.303]  Big Brother.
[01:00:02.303 --> 01:00:03.984]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:03.984 --> 01:00:05.385]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:05.385 --> 01:00:06.645]  You want answers?
[01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.226]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:08.226 --> 01:00:11.488]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.696 --> 01:00:31.639]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[01:00:31.639 --> 01:00:34.621]  I've got nothing better to do.
[01:00:34.621 --> 01:00:38.084]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
[01:00:38.084 --> 01:00:41.587]  What do you think I'm broke?
[01:00:41.587 --> 01:00:43.869]  Huh?
[01:00:43.869 --> 01:00:51.275]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, worldwide, on this Wednesday, July 14th, 2010 edition.
[01:00:55.643 --> 01:01:03.608]  This is the most important broadcast I have ever done in my 15 years of transmission.
[01:01:03.608 --> 01:01:16.196]  The most important broadcast I have ever done, except for maybe my 9-11-2001 transmission, when I laid it all on the line, when nobody else would, and told it like it was.
[01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:19.610]  You have epiphanies.
[01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:21.871]  You have basically brainstorms.
[01:01:21.871 --> 01:01:30.234]  Moments where you realize that you've been right about everything and the picture that was already clear becomes crystal clear.
[01:01:30.234 --> 01:01:31.655]  Crystal clear.
[01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:33.875]  I'm going to say this succinctly.
[01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:34.496]  There is a 100% chance
[01:01:38.413 --> 01:01:53.730]  That the United States will completely collapse into a road warrior like scenario if we do not address the problems now and point out that this is being engineered by design.
[01:01:54.671 --> 01:01:59.753]  Now, this road warrior collapse will only go on for a few years.
[01:01:59.753 --> 01:02:02.654]  It is being orchestrated to fully break the United States.
[01:02:02.654 --> 01:02:10.918]  This is an economic-slash-military coup d'etat, not just against the United States, but against the entire Western world.
[01:02:10.918 --> 01:02:17.461]  The globalists have already destroyed and leveled and annihilated and decimated the third world, and it's all been declassified.
[01:02:17.461 --> 01:02:21.823]  The IMF and World Bank brag in their internal memos that they have orchestrated it.
[01:02:22.643 --> 01:02:28.090]  They are doing the exact same thing here, but with a 21st century high-tech overlay.
[01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:34.158]  This is a mega 100% red alert, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:34.158 --> 01:02:35.180]  Red alert!
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:03:05.263]  We could go into the full collapse as early as next year, perhaps even sooner, but within the next two years, it is a 100% guaranteed fact that this society is completely collapsing by design and then what they have to offer after they've engineered the collapse and they've trained people to fully submit and accept a new way of life, living under the boot of the New World Order.
[01:03:06.474 --> 01:03:10.335]  It is so important what we are going to be covering today.
[01:03:10.335 --> 01:03:13.875]  Larry Pratt's joining us on the Second Amendment front for 30 minutes later.
[01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:20.376]  Richard Reeves for 30 minutes in studio dealing with the Napa Superhighways and the toll roads that they're putting in all over the nation.
[01:03:20.376 --> 01:03:25.797]  In the last few years, there's been massive resistance to it, so they played possum and claimed that they weren't going to do it.
[01:03:25.797 --> 01:03:26.978]  Now they're back with a vengeance.
[01:03:26.978 --> 01:03:30.778]  This is a key part of the globalist funding mechanism worldwide.
[01:03:30.778 --> 01:03:34.479]  We'll be exposing that coming up as well.
[01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:41.568]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us for Richard Reeves in the middle of the next hour, then Larry Pratt joining us at the beginning of the third hour.
[01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:46.355]  But I want to be extremely clear with everyone here today.
[01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:48.478]  Here are just some of the data points.
[01:03:49.676 --> 01:03:55.460]  When we come back from break, I'm going to break down and explain why I've come to this realization.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.122]  Number one, the mainstream media is talking about total, complete collapse.
[01:03:59.122 --> 01:04:01.424]  Worse than the Great Depression everywhere.
[01:04:01.424 --> 01:04:02.685]  Of course, they've been engineering this.
[01:04:02.685 --> 01:04:06.007]  They hid that fact from you for the last few years, as we told you they would.
[01:04:06.007 --> 01:04:10.270]  But before they fully collapse our nation into the world government, that they would announce it.
[01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:11.511]  That is now happening.
[01:04:11.511 --> 01:04:13.172]  This is just the last day and a half.
[01:04:13.172 --> 01:04:14.933]  Central banks start to abandon the U.S.
[01:04:14.933 --> 01:04:15.794]  dollar.
[01:04:15.794 --> 01:04:18.115]  And who could blame them, is the quote.
[01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:18.275]  CNN.
[01:04:19.396 --> 01:04:24.860]  Uh, London Telegraph, Chinese rating agency strips Western nations of AAA status.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.202]  Both parties mold raising retirement age.
[01:04:27.202 --> 01:04:28.103]  Washington Times.
[01:04:29.673 --> 01:04:32.314]  Crisis awaits world banks as trillions come due.
[01:04:32.314 --> 01:04:33.134]  The big crash.
[01:04:33.134 --> 01:04:35.395]  America plunges into depression.
[01:04:35.395 --> 01:04:38.216]  This is all mainstream news in your face.
[01:04:38.216 --> 01:04:46.438]  That dovetails with all these police departments announcing that they're not going to stop people for assault, for poisoning, for robbery, for burglary.
[01:04:46.438 --> 01:04:52.360]  I'm going to explain what's happening and the most important information when we come back.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.380]  Here's the headline.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.401]  Top Clinton official.
[01:04:54.401 --> 01:04:55.481]  I'm getting chills.
[01:04:55.481 --> 01:04:58.062]  Only a terror attack can save Obama.
[01:04:58.062 --> 01:04:58.562]  Get ready.
[01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:02.466]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:07.768]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[01:05:07.768 --> 01:05:10.569]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[01:05:10.569 --> 01:05:14.231]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[01:05:14.231 --> 01:05:20.253]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[01:05:24.435 --> 01:05:29.856]  It contains two weeks of delicious, easy-to-fix food, along with the equipment to prepare it.
[01:05:29.856 --> 01:05:32.937]  It's packed in a rugged, heavy-duty tote for transport.
[01:05:32.937 --> 01:05:37.338]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[01:05:37.338 --> 01:05:42.680]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.521]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[01:05:46.521 --> 01:05:51.262]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:51.582 --> 01:05:53.825]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex
[01:05:59.093 --> 01:06:04.057]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:04.057 --> 01:06:05.057]  What have we got?
[01:06:05.057 --> 01:06:07.499]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:06:07.499 --> 01:06:08.520]  A republic.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.162]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:06:11.162 --> 01:06:13.424]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:06:13.424 --> 01:06:15.445]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:06:15.445 --> 01:06:17.126]  So they think they own our land?
[01:06:17.126 --> 01:06:18.447]  They think they own our water?
[01:06:18.447 --> 01:06:19.068]  Children?
[01:06:19.068 --> 01:06:20.189]  Our education?
[01:06:20.189 --> 01:06:21.009]  Our money?
[01:06:21.009 --> 01:06:24.672]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:06:25.032 --> 01:06:29.999]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:06:29.999 --> 01:06:31.020]  We have the facts.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.182]  We have the Constitution.
[01:06:32.182 --> 01:06:33.103]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:06:33.103 --> 01:06:33.984]  We have common law.
[01:06:33.984 --> 01:06:36.508]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:36.508 --> 01:06:40.273]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:06:40.373 --> 01:06:45.338]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[01:07:55.519 --> 01:08:03.504]  Check them out today.
[01:08:03.504 --> 01:08:09.887]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:12.972 --> 01:08:16.124]  Thank you for joining us on this July 14th, 2010 Wednesday edition.
[01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:42.996]  You heard it here first, 100% probability that we will have a complete orchestrated collapse in the United States within the next 12 to 24 months, probably even sooner, that's conservative, if we do not realize the fight we're in, if we do not face the enemy that is coming down on us hardcore.
[01:08:42.996 --> 01:08:44.157]  I want to make something clear here.
[01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.208]  Barack Obama is a puppet.
[01:08:47.208 --> 01:08:49.750]  Barack Obama is a wicked scapegoat.
[01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:54.773]  Barack Obama is a Harvard CIA frontman lawyer.
[01:08:54.773 --> 01:09:01.437]  Barack Obama was designed for the implosion that you are now seeing.
[01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.298]  Understand that.
[01:09:03.118 --> 01:09:07.141]  The system knows there's a complete global realignment against tyranny.
[01:09:07.141 --> 01:09:10.343]  They know there's a worldwide awakening against the New World Order.
[01:09:10.343 --> 01:09:13.846]  Their own policy reports and Zbigniew Brzezinski admit that.
[01:09:13.846 --> 01:09:21.892]  And they are going to try to play the Tea Parties, the populist, the constitutional populist off against the dumbed-down TV heads.
[01:09:22.672 --> 01:09:32.140]  And basically distract us while they establish this world government that will be built out of the ashes of the worldwide depression that they've engineered.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.623]  The end of the dollar is the world reserve currency.
[01:09:34.623 --> 01:09:36.004]  The end of our borders.
[01:09:36.004 --> 01:09:37.205]  The North American Union.
[01:09:37.205 --> 01:09:46.233]  It's all in the SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership documents that were released in 2007 via the four-year lawsuit by Judicial Watch.
[01:09:47.526 --> 01:09:52.007]  Now the data points are the media is now admitting we're going into a depression.
[01:09:52.007 --> 01:10:01.370]  All over the nation the announcements are being made that basic essential services from potholes to roads to police are just going to be shut off.
[01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:06.392]  This is the same thing that's been done in the third world over and over again via the IMF World Bank receivership.
[01:10:06.392 --> 01:10:08.072]  It's called shock therapy doctrine.
[01:10:08.072 --> 01:10:09.953]  We have the internal IMF World Bank documents.
[01:10:10.533 --> 01:10:13.474]  2,000 pages that were leaked in 2002.
[01:10:13.474 --> 01:10:15.234]  BBC Greg Palast covered it.
[01:10:15.234 --> 01:10:17.834]  We know exactly what they are going to do.
[01:10:17.834 --> 01:10:21.855]  They will jack up the taxes but cut out all the services.
[01:10:21.855 --> 01:10:24.075]  They will at least triple the prices of water.
[01:10:24.075 --> 01:10:26.216]  They will put toll roads on every major road.
[01:10:26.216 --> 01:10:32.437]  8,000 miles of road in Texas is their announcement just as a microcosm example.
[01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.517]  This is hellish what they're going to do.
[01:10:34.517 --> 01:10:37.758]  They're suddenly massively increasing water prices and privatizing it in
[01:10:39.358 --> 01:10:40.099]  Australia.
[01:10:40.099 --> 01:10:42.082]  They're suddenly doing that all over the United States.
[01:10:42.082 --> 01:10:42.663]  In England.
[01:10:42.663 --> 01:10:44.766]  It's all happening right now.
[01:10:44.766 --> 01:10:47.530]  They're going to take your jobs and raise the prices.
[01:10:48.427 --> 01:10:53.509]  To bankrupt you as a tool of total economic domination to them.
[01:10:53.509 --> 01:11:02.013]  Then they will come in with the new SDR global currency that will back your fiat currency that is simply a global currency local version.
[01:11:02.013 --> 01:11:03.874]  It's like your driver's license is federal.
[01:11:03.874 --> 01:11:05.734]  It just says Texas or California.
[01:11:05.734 --> 01:11:06.935]  That's the real ID.
[01:11:06.935 --> 01:11:10.476]  That was in the executive order 1994 by Clinton implemented by 2000.
[01:11:10.476 --> 01:11:12.277]  You were told two years ago in 2008.
[01:11:12.277 --> 01:11:15.799]  This is all a strategic stated plan.
[01:11:15.799 --> 01:11:16.259]  Understand.
[01:11:16.579 --> 01:11:19.382]  I am telling you their stated plan.
[01:11:19.382 --> 01:11:23.606]  This is 100% accurate, the information you are receiving.
[01:11:23.606 --> 01:11:25.588]  This is not my opinion.
[01:11:25.588 --> 01:11:30.312]  But now we have a clear image of just how hardcore they're going to slam this economy.
[01:11:30.312 --> 01:11:31.674]  It's worse than I thought.
[01:11:31.674 --> 01:11:33.476]  It is road warrior-ish.
[01:11:33.476 --> 01:11:37.940]  It is the road level, that film about collapse of society.
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.641]  And out of that collapse will come the
[01:11:40.322 --> 01:11:47.346]  Total deindustrialization and then the completely managed society, the collectivist society of the New World Order.
[01:11:47.346 --> 01:11:54.930]  This is their stated aim at the Pentagon, at the UN, at the Club of Rome, at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:57.332]  So let's get into the information right now.
[01:11:58.655 --> 01:12:05.543]  Finally, CBS News and others are reporting that every major poll shows Obama has dropped to 40 points at least.
[01:12:05.543 --> 01:12:09.508]  In some polls, he has a low 30% approval rating.
[01:12:09.508 --> 01:12:13.492]  In some polls, over a 70% negative approval rating.
[01:12:13.492 --> 01:12:17.297]  The Times of London, the Financial Times, the Associated Press, Reuters,
[01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:28.224]  Politico, Wall Street Journal, New York Times are all announcing that Obama is politically destroyed and that he's not treading water, that he is sunken beneath the waves.
[01:12:28.224 --> 01:12:31.146]  It is a complete collapse.
[01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:36.129]  Suddenly, we're seeing globalist think tanks openly speaking.
[01:12:36.129 --> 01:12:37.150]  Top Clinton adviser
[01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:49.277]  Of course, Mr. Shapiro and others are in the news saying, if we don't have another Oklahoma City or 9-11, Obama is done and our agenda for globalization is over.
[01:12:49.277 --> 01:13:05.007]  So the elites are openly showing there's an internal debate about this, and we know there is, saying, look, we've got to have a terror attack, even if the 9-11 truthers and the Oklahoma City people that have exposed that as an inside job, even though they've done their work and exposed us, and a lot of elites believe that that
[01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:11.309]  False flag tool has been irrevocably damaged, that they've got to go with a false flag.
[01:13:11.309 --> 01:13:22.993]  Let's cover that first, then we'll look at the other false flags, economic, military, and of course environmental, that they are executing and exacerbating.
[01:13:22.993 --> 01:13:28.235]  From the oil spill to the situation with Iran, this is going to be a perfect storm.
[01:13:28.235 --> 01:13:31.616]  Obama isn't meant to survive this politically, and maybe not even physically.
[01:13:32.276 --> 01:13:33.998]  And we pray that doesn't happen.
[01:13:33.998 --> 01:13:36.340]  He is meant to be destroyed in the process.
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.282]  That is what these globalists do.
[01:13:38.282 --> 01:13:40.765]  This is how they operate.
[01:13:40.765 --> 01:13:41.886]  Now, let's go over it.
[01:13:41.886 --> 01:13:50.115]  This is a PrisonPlanet.com article directly quoting, directly quoting the Financial Times of London that came out last night.
[01:13:50.115 --> 01:13:52.578]  It was the top link on the Drudge Report.
[01:13:52.578 --> 01:13:53.398]  At about 8 p.m.
[01:13:53.398 --> 01:13:54.299]  I was up here working.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:03.548]  One of the guys came over and handed me the article with it highlighted, and then I had Aaron post it, and then Paul Watson did a story this morning.
[01:14:03.548 --> 01:14:06.290]  So this is getting major attention, and that's good.
[01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:11.294]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[01:14:11.294 --> 01:14:21.363]  Then Watson, chillingly, with his precise research, goes through all the previous statements of the think tanks calling for staged terror attacks.
[01:14:21.363 --> 01:14:21.523]  Now,
[01:14:22.384 --> 01:14:30.670]  Let me actually just read to you from the Financial Times of London itself so you can see this.
[01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:36.154]  Here is the Financial Times of London and this story is now the official talking point.
[01:14:36.154 --> 01:14:41.558]  There are hundreds of papers all simultaneously reporting this worldwide today.
[01:14:41.558 --> 01:14:44.720]  So they are purposefully destroying Obama.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:50.064]  They are purposely admitting he has collapsed and saying he needs a terror attack.
[01:14:50.064 --> 01:14:50.945]  Listen to this quote.
[01:14:51.832 --> 01:14:58.994]  Okay, this is by Mr. Shapiro, top advisor to Bill Clinton and advisor to Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:07.796]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, says Rob Shapiro, another former Clinton official and supporter of Obama.
[01:15:07.796 --> 01:15:19.739]  He has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and, short of a 9-11 event or Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think
[01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:22.621]  of how he could do that.
[01:15:22.621 --> 01:15:27.143]  Now, I just read you that quote.
[01:15:27.143 --> 01:15:34.508]  I just went over that quote for you here on air.
[01:15:34.508 --> 01:15:44.435]  Now, you dovetail that with the mindset of these people, and with the Pentagon just four years ago, or three years ago under Rumsfeld,
[01:15:45.865 --> 01:15:46.725]  Donald Rumsfeld
[01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:05.050]  I don't
[01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:24.843]  You see, this is bipartisan.
[01:16:24.843 --> 01:16:28.344]  This is their crisis creation mentality.
[01:16:28.344 --> 01:16:31.445]  But it is so important to get this report out to everyone.
[01:16:31.445 --> 01:16:34.866]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[01:16:34.866 --> 01:16:38.427]  Now I'm going to go back into this in a moment, but here is another report.
[01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.728]  The October surprise is coming.
[01:16:41.937 --> 01:16:43.278]  And of course it is.
[01:16:43.278 --> 01:16:44.359]  Fox News.
[01:16:44.359 --> 01:16:47.621]  Outsider wins Alabama GOP governor nomination.
[01:16:47.621 --> 01:16:58.609]  Self-described outsider Robert Bentley won Alabama's Republican nomination for governor Tuesday night over established candidate Bradley Brine with a strong showing in rural areas.
[01:16:58.609 --> 01:17:00.530]  See, people are going and voting out.
[01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:02.712]  Democrats who are seen as establishment.
[01:17:02.712 --> 01:17:04.413]  Specter in the primary.
[01:17:04.413 --> 01:17:07.735]  Republicans that are seen as establishment running against Rand Paul.
[01:17:07.735 --> 01:17:09.296]  He wins in Kentucky.
[01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:09.717]  Hawaii.
[01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:17.199]  Utah, Colorado, Massachusetts, you know the cases.
[01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:21.581]  This is not one party in favor, one party out of favor.
[01:17:21.581 --> 01:17:27.282]  The reason the system is panicking, they can always just exchange, take a left step, take a right step.
[01:17:27.282 --> 01:17:31.983]  Nobody ever looks at the body these legs are carrying, or the brain, the global central banks.
[01:17:31.983 --> 01:17:34.044]  They look at the legs, or they look at the wing.
[01:17:34.764 --> 01:17:37.786]  The left wing of the right wing, not the bird that the wings are attached to.
[01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:51.757]  That's what we focus on here is this carrion crow, is this buzzard, this vulture, this blood-drinking, corrupt, parasitic, vampiric system of oppression and corruption.
[01:17:51.757 --> 01:17:59.343]  So, the reason they're in panic mode is, and I told you this a year and a half ago, because I saw Republicans and Democrats being booted every town hall.
[01:17:59.343 --> 01:18:01.364]  The media spun it and said it was just the leftists.
[01:18:01.364 --> 01:18:03.206]  Again, getting ready to scapegoat Obama.
[01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:07.544]  The left's doing that because they're all part of the same power structure.
[01:18:07.544 --> 01:18:10.307]  Fox News and the right wing are playing along with that.
[01:18:10.307 --> 01:18:14.431]  And they're trying to manage it and impose this anti-establishment so they can hold on.
[01:18:14.431 --> 01:18:17.234]  The only one that's done it is Rick Perry so far.
[01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:21.739]  He's the only person to win as an incumbent in a primary in the last year and a half.
[01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:32.658]  Because he started claiming he was shooting coyotes in the city limits and wearing cowboy hats and being seen with guns every day and talking about secession and fighting the New World Order.
[01:18:32.658 --> 01:18:37.763]  I mean, he put on the coloration of an Alex Jones and so he was able to survive.
[01:18:40.287 --> 01:18:43.248]  My friends, this is so massive what's happening.
[01:18:43.248 --> 01:18:45.088]  The elite are gonna hit you and hit you hard.
[01:18:45.088 --> 01:18:54.930]  To keep you in the left-right paradigm, they're gonna have the NAACP say, if you're against government healthcare, if you're against socialism, if you're against the carbon tax, you are a Klan member.
[01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.830]  They've said that in the last two days.
[01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:59.650]  To scare black people and to keep them on the reservation.
[01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:00.891]  Mecha, La Raza.
[01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:08.752]  Hey, if Arizona doesn't wanna collapse and have their whole state taken over and have thousands of dead and be the kidnapping capital of the United States, they're racist.
[01:19:09.272 --> 01:19:10.193]  But it isn't working.
[01:19:10.193 --> 01:19:12.595]  But that's another example of false flag terror.
[01:19:12.595 --> 01:19:19.220]  Where they're invoking race, cold-bloodedly, knowing it has nothing to do with it, to manipulate and control people.
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.040]  The oil spill.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:27.426]  Clearly they gave orders to the operators that they knew on record in the Coast Guard report would cause the well to blow up.
[01:19:27.426 --> 01:19:28.567]  They blocked the response.
[01:19:28.567 --> 01:19:29.507]  They blocked the cleanup.
[01:19:29.507 --> 01:19:33.570]  They blocked the foreign skimmer ships to make the crisis as big as they can.
[01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:36.352]  They're gearing up for an Iran attack and now openly admitting it.
[01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:45.599]  While all this is going on, they're setting up their new global banking takeover, their new global government at the end of the dollar, as the world reserve currency in the background.
[01:19:45.599 --> 01:19:58.227]  That's the key to what's happening, and we'll get to the most important information straight ahead, the collapse of this republic, how it is being engineered, and how we can defeat these people straight ahead.

[01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.892]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:14.892 --> 01:24:17.036]  Larry Pratt and Richard Reeves scheduled today.
[01:24:17.036 --> 01:24:18.480]  Richard Reeves in studio.
[01:24:22.034 --> 01:24:30.062]  When I get on air and I tell you this is one of the most important, if not the most important broadcast I've ever done, it's just all the facts are out on the table.
[01:24:30.062 --> 01:24:36.609]  Everything we predicted, everything we got from the Globalist documents and think tanks and leaks is just confirmed.
[01:24:36.609 --> 01:24:37.930]  This is their plan.
[01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:41.093]  This is their program, the designed collapse of society.
[01:24:41.093 --> 01:24:42.835]  And I'm going to talk about that collapse.
[01:24:43.235 --> 01:24:48.177]  And how we can fight against this by exposing the culprits and the fact that it is by design.
[01:24:48.177 --> 01:24:59.602]  They're going to collapse society, blame their puppets, and then offer their solution of even more tyranny and the nanny state and the carbon tax control system through the crisis they're now orchestrating.
[01:24:59.602 --> 01:25:01.383]  And I'm going to cover that in a moment.
[01:25:01.383 --> 01:25:10.947]  But first, I cannot illustrate to you, the viewers and listeners of this radio broadcast and the folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, that this report by Paul Watson
[01:25:12.048 --> 01:25:17.555]  Reporting on what was said in the Financial Times of London yesterday is so essential.
[01:25:17.555 --> 01:25:19.979]  Top Clinton official.
[01:25:19.979 --> 01:25:23.184]  Only a terror attack can save America.
[01:25:24.462 --> 01:25:24.602]  I think?
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.141]  We're good to go.
[01:26:03.183 --> 01:26:05.365]  And an attack on Iran is a terror attack.
[01:26:05.365 --> 01:26:08.087]  That'll drive up oil, start real terror attacks.
[01:26:08.087 --> 01:26:09.288]  Iran's sure to strike back.
[01:26:09.288 --> 01:26:10.589]  I mean, it's going to be hellish.
[01:26:10.589 --> 01:26:13.731]  They'll be able to crack down on political dissent, take over the web.
[01:26:13.731 --> 01:26:17.854]  As they've been saying, they need this new cybersecurity bill to shut the web off during a war.
[01:26:17.854 --> 01:26:19.475]  You can see it all coming together.
[01:26:19.475 --> 01:26:27.061]  This is the greatest danger this country has been in since its foundation, since we were battling to start the country.
[01:26:27.061 --> 01:26:27.621]  Here's the quote.
[01:26:28.601 --> 01:26:46.628]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, said Shapiro, adding, quote, he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think of how he could do just that.
[01:26:46.628 --> 01:26:51.569]  This is why we talk about state's terror so much, because it is the ace in the hole.
[01:26:51.569 --> 01:26:52.830]  It is the royal flush.
[01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:57.431]  It is the major Trump card that they play.
[01:26:57.431 --> 01:27:03.052]  And by exposing this, we're able to stop these people.
[01:27:03.052 --> 01:27:18.416]  And the fact that the public is starting to wake up, I went over and saw my parents late last night when I was driving home at about 10, and I got the book in the car, I forget the title, but it's the best-selling New York Times, number one best-selling author, who wrote Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
[01:27:18.416 --> 01:27:20.717]  And my dad's like, this book is about staged terror.
[01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:37.323]  You know, the book title deals with a theater fire that happened in Venice, but it talks about how, it's non-fiction, how he met with the elite of Italy and the Prime Minister and others, who I know on record exposed that our government staged terror attacks in Italy in the 70s and 80s to blame it on their political enemies.
[01:27:37.323 --> 01:27:38.904]  It's called Operation Gladio.
[01:27:38.904 --> 01:27:45.629]  But the point that a New York Times number one bestseller's new book out that's already a New York Times bestseller, and I meant to bring it in.
[01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:47.771]  In fact, guys, will you grab my keys and run out?
[01:27:47.771 --> 01:27:49.793]  It's in the passenger seat of my car.
[01:27:51.269 --> 01:28:05.136]  That my dad just grabs literature, or I mean top non-fiction book, and within 15 pages it's a book really about false flag terror.
[01:28:05.136 --> 01:28:06.417]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:28:06.917 --> 01:28:09.279]  You go see movies like Children of Men.
[01:28:09.279 --> 01:28:14.623]  It's all about the government staging terror attacks and putting a sterilization chemical into the population.
[01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:18.346]  I mean most movies I see now even in fiction.
[01:28:18.346 --> 01:28:25.591]  So the point is there's been a huge awakening to the fact that all of this is going on.
[01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:26.292]  There has been
[01:28:28.377 --> 01:28:36.402]  A renaissance in understanding, almost a revelation in understanding of this and everywhere I see it in popular culture.
[01:28:36.402 --> 01:28:43.786]  And this is not just the system conditioning us, this is people rebelling who are authors and artists and filmmakers.
[01:28:43.786 --> 01:28:45.227]  I mean, I talk to a lot of these people.
[01:28:46.605 --> 01:28:53.152]  And of course, it's the City of Falling Angels by the author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
[01:28:53.152 --> 01:28:57.157]  And the New York Times says, an urbane and beautifully fashioned book.
[01:28:57.157 --> 01:28:59.099]  Number one New York Times bestseller.
[01:28:59.099 --> 01:29:03.284]  John Burnett, I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:29:03.284 --> 01:29:04.225]  And here it is.
[01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:07.188]  Yes.
[01:29:22.145 --> 01:29:26.508]  And of course, this same Italian Prime Minister has gone public two years ago saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:29:26.508 --> 01:29:28.229]  That's not in the book, at least as far as we know.
[01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:31.432]  We haven't gotten through the book yet.
[01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:40.778]  But just a side point example of how the awakening to false flag terror is really exploding.
[01:29:40.778 --> 01:29:41.719]  All right, we're going to come back.
[01:29:41.719 --> 01:29:47.703]  It's the most important information in this whole rant that I'm laying out and how we can stop these people.
[01:29:47.703 --> 01:29:48.283]  Straight ahead.
[01:29:48.283 --> 01:29:48.704]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.997 --> 01:29:53.920]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:59.345]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.345 --> 01:30:00.986]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:30:51.378 --> 01:30:51.878]  Thank you!
[01:30:58.885 --> 01:31:03.428]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:03.428 --> 01:31:04.329]  Number 1.
[01:31:04.329 --> 01:31:07.772]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:07.772 --> 01:31:08.632]  Number 2.
[01:31:08.632 --> 01:31:13.516]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:13.516 --> 01:31:14.256]  It's true.
[01:31:14.256 --> 01:31:19.140]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:19.961]  Number 3.
[01:31:19.961 --> 01:31:23.543]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:23.543 --> 01:31:27.246]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:27.446 --> 01:31:28.246]  Number 4.
[01:31:28.246 --> 01:31:31.007]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.007 --> 01:31:34.688]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:34.688 --> 01:31:35.469]  Number 5.
[01:31:35.469 --> 01:31:39.610]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:44.672]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:44.672 --> 01:31:48.853]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:48.853 --> 01:31:50.633]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:55.875 --> 01:31:59.158]  877-327-0365.
[01:31:59.158 --> 01:32:01.980]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:07.284]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[01:32:07.284 --> 01:32:10.086]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[01:32:10.086 --> 01:32:13.749]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[01:32:13.749 --> 01:32:19.774]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[01:32:23.957 --> 01:32:29.383]  It contains two weeks of delicious easy-to-fix food along with the equipment to prepare it.
[01:32:29.383 --> 01:32:32.466]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[01:32:32.466 --> 01:32:36.870]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:42.195]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[01:32:42.195 --> 01:32:45.739]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[01:32:46.039 --> 01:32:51.103]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:51.103 --> 01:32:52.464]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:32:52.464 --> 01:33:00.910]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:06.935]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:06.935 --> 01:33:09.497]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.701 --> 01:33:18.306]  With New York Times number one best-selling authors like John Burren are writing books about real U.S.
[01:33:18.306 --> 01:33:24.830]  government stage terror, you know the system has got a serious, serious problem.
[01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:26.471]  And that's what's so amazing about it.
[01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:33.817]  Four years ago, Gary Hart, and we actually have a clip of this in my film, Truth Rising, where we are changed, talked to him.
[01:33:34.597 --> 01:33:43.107]  He wrote a public letter to Ahmadinejad and he said, the US government staged the Gulf of Tonkin and other events like the Maine.
[01:33:43.107 --> 01:33:45.190]  We will stage events in the future.
[01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:48.494]  Don't think we won't attack you if you don't do what you're told.
[01:33:48.494 --> 01:33:49.936]  We will stage terror attacks.
[01:33:49.936 --> 01:33:51.878]  And we went and talked to him and he said, yeah, I said that.
[01:33:51.878 --> 01:33:52.459]  I wrote him the letter.
[01:33:53.507 --> 01:33:58.869]  Now this is Gary Hart who wrote up the Homeland Security Plan in 1993 with Bill Clinton.
[01:33:58.869 --> 01:34:05.571]  This is the guy at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2000 with the Hart-Rudman Commission that wrote up the current plan we're living under.
[01:34:05.571 --> 01:34:11.092]  He said we're going to use this disaster, 9-11, to establish a new world order.
[01:34:11.092 --> 01:34:13.613]  Remember that quote?
[01:34:13.613 --> 01:34:14.753]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[01:34:14.753 --> 01:34:19.435]  You guys, when you get a chance, I don't need it right now, search engine the term on YouTube.
[01:34:19.435 --> 01:34:21.775]  It'll be for my films, but it was on C-SPAN.
[01:34:21.775 --> 01:34:22.996]  It'll be Gary Hart.
[01:34:24.755 --> 01:34:28.022]  Says use 9-11 for New World Order, and it's him sitting at a desk.
[01:34:28.022 --> 01:34:33.495]  We need to use this disaster for what the president's father called a New World Order.
[01:34:36.226 --> 01:34:37.646]  That's an exact quote.
[01:34:37.646 --> 01:34:40.607]  So that's why it's so important to get this article out.
[01:34:40.607 --> 01:34:45.429]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[01:34:45.429 --> 01:34:54.231]  What have I been saying for the last six months when he went down below a 50% approval rating, now at 40 and dropping a point or so every week in free fall?
[01:34:54.231 --> 01:34:57.052]  I said, only a terror attack.
[01:34:57.052 --> 01:34:59.593]  A huge staged war will work.
[01:35:00.573 --> 01:35:02.275]  Some other type of natural disaster.
[01:35:02.275 --> 01:35:04.517]  We're now seeing that man-made natural disaster.
[01:35:04.517 --> 01:35:07.900]  It's a man-made disaster that's now a disaster in nature.
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:11.102]  I guess would be the proper way to put it.
[01:35:11.102 --> 01:35:14.025]  A environmental disaster.
[01:35:14.025 --> 01:35:15.426]  A border disaster.
[01:35:15.426 --> 01:35:18.429]  Notice how they tell Arizona, we're not going to let you fix that problem.
[01:35:18.429 --> 01:35:19.750]  The thousands of dead.
[01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:23.333]  You're the kidnapping capital of the United States now.
[01:35:23.333 --> 01:35:25.655]  Over 80 miles of the country off limits to citizens.
[01:35:26.756 --> 01:35:33.800]  And Obama told Senator Kyle a month ago, we can't let it get better, we've got to let it collapse so we can have a North American Union.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.801]  So we can have legalization of the illegals.
[01:35:35.801 --> 01:35:40.323]  What did the Banff Canada meeting 2006, declassified 2007 say?
[01:35:40.323 --> 01:35:52.910]  We will use border crises to merge Canada and Mexico into a unified security perimeter around the North American continent from Alaska to the southern border of Mexico with Guatemala.
[01:35:54.127 --> 01:35:55.748]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:35:55.748 --> 01:35:57.869]  This is their methodology.
[01:35:57.869 --> 01:35:59.590]  We have their playbook.
[01:35:59.590 --> 01:36:00.450]  We know.
[01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:06.813]  They think you're so stupid and so pathetic that they will sit there all over the news.
[01:36:06.813 --> 01:36:15.718]  I mean, Watson's got a bunch of examples of them in the news saying Obama needs another Oklahoma City or another 9-11 with the thinnest of veiled threats.
[01:36:17.008 --> 01:36:20.555]  The I described it earlier is as thick as a Bible page.
[01:36:20.555 --> 01:36:22.358]  I mean it is see through 100% and
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.762]  They are desperate, and they are abusing every crisis they can.
[01:36:29.762 --> 01:36:33.706]  And remember, people say, well, this crisis, the oil's gonna destroy Obama.
[01:36:33.706 --> 01:36:37.749]  The collapsing border and this lawsuit against Arizona is gonna destroy Obama.
[01:36:37.749 --> 01:36:40.231]  Obama's socialist healthcare, it's so unpopular.
[01:36:40.231 --> 01:36:43.594]  Over 70% in polls when they passed it were against it, even higher now.
[01:36:43.594 --> 01:36:48.619]  The media puts out whitewash polls of 60% or so, 55-60.
[01:36:48.619 --> 01:36:49.499]  Why would he do this?
[01:36:49.499 --> 01:36:52.882]  Because his job is to take all the heat.
[01:36:52.882 --> 01:36:54.304]  You know, my parents have a cockatoo.
[01:36:55.502 --> 01:36:58.288]  And the cockatoo is the new world order.
[01:36:58.288 --> 01:37:02.457]  Here's my parable or analysis, analogy.
[01:37:03.849 --> 01:37:07.071]  And they put birdcage liner in every couple of days.
[01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:16.257]  They put the Austin America Statesman newspaper, the local paper, in it there for its droppings and for the food it doesn't eat that drop.
[01:37:16.257 --> 01:37:18.679]  The bird wastes about half the food it eats and plays with it.
[01:37:18.679 --> 01:37:20.860]  There's all this food and crap at the bottom of it.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:23.202]  And Barack Obama is the birdcage liner.
[01:37:23.202 --> 01:37:28.025]  And the New World Order is crapping on us and dropping food on us and we're blaming the birdcage liner.
[01:37:28.025 --> 01:37:30.427]  And it's nasty and it's gross and it's ugly and it's
[01:37:31.007 --> 01:37:32.968]  But still, the bird is the issue.
[01:37:32.968 --> 01:37:35.369]  George W. Bush, bird cage liner.
[01:37:35.369 --> 01:37:41.953]  Here's another analogy, or another parallel to what we're talking about.
[01:37:44.946 --> 01:37:48.048]  We're always focusing on the red cape.
[01:37:48.048 --> 01:37:49.029]  We're the bull.
[01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:51.231]  Well, we're smarter than a bull, but we don't act like that.
[01:37:51.231 --> 01:38:00.598]  And the matador uses that, that red, and he comes up and throws little darts in the back of the bull to get the bull out of sorts, angry.
[01:38:00.598 --> 01:38:02.139]  One dart is the oil spill.
[01:38:02.139 --> 01:38:04.161]  Another dart is the imploding economy.
[01:38:04.161 --> 01:38:05.802]  Another dart's the open borders.
[01:38:05.802 --> 01:38:07.784]  Another dart is socialist health care.
[01:38:07.784 --> 01:38:10.966]  Another dart is police refusing to stop criminals now openly.
[01:38:10.966 --> 01:38:12.968]  This has always been the policy in the last hundred years.
[01:38:12.968 --> 01:38:13.689]  Now it's just public.
[01:38:14.849 --> 01:38:15.290]  I don't know.
[01:38:31.152 --> 01:38:33.533]  It's all just a little inside joke to them.
[01:38:59.261 --> 01:39:00.002]  Does that.
[01:39:00.002 --> 01:39:02.984]  And then finally the bull's got snot coming out his nose.
[01:39:02.984 --> 01:39:03.684]  He's angry.
[01:39:03.684 --> 01:39:04.705]  He's exhausted.
[01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:07.667]  This bull fight's gone on for 35 minutes.
[01:39:07.667 --> 01:39:09.989]  And the matador pulls out his sword.
[01:39:09.989 --> 01:39:11.610]  Long and sharp.
[01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:15.052]  And he puts the red cape out.
[01:39:15.052 --> 01:39:17.114]  And the bull charges and he steps aside.
[01:39:18.484 --> 01:39:20.906]  And the bull impales itself.
[01:39:20.906 --> 01:39:27.409]  The matador, with precision, stands before the New World Order crowd, and they cheer him, and they throw the rose petals at him.
[01:39:27.409 --> 01:39:30.912]  And the señoritas want to go out with him that night.
[01:39:30.912 --> 01:39:33.813]  And everybody buys him drinks at the bar, and he's wealthy.
[01:39:33.813 --> 01:39:34.554]  He's the star.
[01:39:36.974 --> 01:39:41.395]  I don't focus on Barack Obama, the red cape.
[01:39:41.395 --> 01:39:47.877]  I don't focus on George W. Bush or Sarah Palin or Glenn Beck being set up for a fall, the birdcage liner.
[01:39:47.877 --> 01:39:50.358]  I focus on the bird.
[01:39:50.358 --> 01:39:52.379]  I focus on the matador.
[01:39:52.379 --> 01:40:00.501]  I focus on the head, the brain, the system, the control arm, the philosophy.
[01:40:00.501 --> 01:40:04.843]  And if we are able to expose this paradigm to people, if we are able,
[01:40:05.768 --> 01:40:08.915]  To reveal this to the population.
[01:40:09.858 --> 01:40:19.866]  If we are able to cause a exponential viral understanding and common sense awakening to these tools that are used and point people at the mountains.
[01:40:19.866 --> 01:40:23.169]  Encyclopedia on top of encyclopedia of admissions.
[01:40:23.169 --> 01:40:29.014]  Because the elite, you know, there's tens of thousands of high-level minions that orchestrate this for the few hundred elite.
[01:40:29.014 --> 01:40:32.397]  Or it's even less, really, if you break it down.
[01:40:32.397 --> 01:40:36.020]  Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, in his best-selling book, called it the superclass of their 6,000.
[01:40:37.341 --> 01:40:38.462]  We're good to go.
[01:41:07.195 --> 01:41:11.899]  You're too busy watching big people fall that you think are big and feeling good about yourself.
[01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:16.602]  You're too busy making fun of Lindsay Lohan and feeling powerful when she fails and is human.
[01:41:16.602 --> 01:41:24.788]  You're too busy worshipping LeBron James who has the Chosen One tattooed blasphemously on his back and on a power trip thinking he's a god.
[01:41:24.788 --> 01:41:27.589]  Life will guarantee, show him that he's just a man.
[01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:32.353]  You know, the beginning of wisdom is being humble and realizing we're all just humans.
[01:41:32.353 --> 01:41:38.378]  But together, through our species and through doing the right thing, that's what gives us beauty and power and strength and honor.
[01:41:38.378 --> 01:41:42.161]  Not being a bunch of arrogant, skin-deep fools.
[01:41:42.161 --> 01:41:46.124]  So we are at this crossroads right now.
[01:41:46.124 --> 01:41:50.888]  And I want to play for you the clip from C-SPAN.
[01:41:50.888 --> 01:41:57.233]  This was just a few days after 9-11, with the Hart-Rudman CFR Commission talking about using 9-11 for a new world order.
[01:41:57.233 --> 01:41:57.533]  Here it is.
[01:41:59.602 --> 01:42:13.505]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world order.
[01:42:13.505 --> 01:42:17.026]  A new world coming.
[01:42:17.026 --> 01:42:28.548]  America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack on our homeland and our military superiority will not entirely protect us.
[01:42:30.007 --> 01:42:36.913]  Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large.
[01:42:36.913 --> 01:42:41.197]  Yeah, that's a clip from Road to Tyranny, the worst rez I've ever seen somebody put on YouTube.
[01:42:41.197 --> 01:42:47.542]  You can see it in high quality in my film Road to Tyranny on DVD, three hour film, breaking down their operations from 2002.
[01:42:47.542 --> 01:42:55.268]  And you watch that film today, eight years later, it's more pertinent today than when I made it, because almost everything that we broke down has now come true.
[01:42:56.269 --> 01:42:58.750]  These films get more powerful with time.
[01:42:58.750 --> 01:42:59.751]  They're evergreen.
[01:42:59.751 --> 01:43:01.872]  They just keep coming and getting stronger.
[01:43:01.872 --> 01:43:05.674]  That's why we're having an exponential effect on the New World Order.
[01:43:05.674 --> 01:43:10.356]  There is a... Well, let's play it again, actually, since you... I mean, let's go ahead and play it.
[01:43:10.356 --> 01:43:13.458]  Go ahead and play it again.
[01:43:13.458 --> 01:43:19.541]  A phrase his father used, I think, only once, and hasn't been used since, and that is a New World Order.
[01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:20.622]  New World Coming.
[01:43:22.934 --> 01:43:28.816]  America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attacks on our homeland.
[01:43:28.816 --> 01:43:40.059]  And right there he's reading from a Council on Foreign Relations report they'd written a year ago, a year before 9-11, about how there were going to be huge terror attacks and life would change forever.
[01:43:40.059 --> 01:43:43.600]  And within 15 minutes of the attacks on CNN, Fox,
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:47.343]  CBS, NBC, ABC, all channels.
[01:43:47.343 --> 01:43:49.645]  They had globalists with the same talking point.
[01:43:49.645 --> 01:43:50.666]  Our life has changed.
[01:43:50.666 --> 01:43:52.047]  The new world order is here.
[01:43:52.047 --> 01:43:53.469]  You're going to have to give your rights up.
[01:43:53.469 --> 01:43:55.871]  We're going to have to attack Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:43:55.871 --> 01:43:57.593]  They had their talking points ready.
[01:43:57.593 --> 01:43:58.654]  Now, three's the charm.
[01:43:58.654 --> 01:44:01.397]  Let's play it from the start.
[01:44:01.397 --> 01:44:02.518]  Go ahead and play it again.
[01:44:02.518 --> 01:44:07.603]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster
[01:44:08.583 --> 01:44:08.984]  Okay.
[01:44:08.984 --> 01:44:15.550]  Alright, let's go ahead now and play the clip of Sanchez on CNN two days ago talking about the horrible bombings in Africa and saying, well, this is actually helpful.
[01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:31.865]  To understand how evil the Muslims are, and if that's the case, so be it.
[01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:33.066]  Again, this is their mindset.
[01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:35.068]  You gotta think like the enemy.
[01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:40.694]  And this guy's showing off to the CIA officer, who's smiling when he says this, that, hey, I'm on the inside.
[01:44:40.694 --> 01:44:43.657]  You know, I'm Sanchez from CNN.
[01:44:43.657 --> 01:44:44.838]  I understand these things.
[01:44:44.838 --> 01:44:47.861]  This is their sick culture.
[01:44:47.861 --> 01:44:48.842]  Here it is.
[01:44:48.842 --> 01:44:50.283]  But you know what's interesting about this?
[01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:51.505]  In a strange way,
[01:44:52.445 --> 01:45:03.795]  The event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are.
[01:45:03.795 --> 01:45:09.740]  And if it helps get the message out there that these are not the good guys, then so be it.
[01:45:11.311 --> 01:45:20.444]  Now folks, I'm not saying that there aren't extreme Muslims and that part of that culture and sects of it do want to take over.
[01:45:20.444 --> 01:45:22.707]  I don't want to live in Saudi Arabia.
[01:45:22.707 --> 01:45:27.253]  I mean, I don't want to live in areas like Somalia.
[01:45:28.393 --> 01:45:45.442]  But the point is, our government went in after World War II on record and radicalized Muslims as a bolster against communism and used the turban-headed guys that mutilate women and do all that as a way to overthrow secular mainline governments.
[01:45:45.442 --> 01:45:51.125]  They didn't want big glistening buildings and swimming pools and jet airplanes in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[01:45:51.125 --> 01:45:52.646]  They don't want First World Nations.
[01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:56.007]  That is their set policy in the Royal Commission on Population 49.
[01:45:57.668 --> 01:46:07.872]  on State Department Memorandum 200 from 1973 and literally hundreds of other declassified government documents from the US and England that we've read here on air.
[01:46:07.872 --> 01:46:20.356]  The point is they have forged radical Islam and supercharged it and opened doors for them and protected them in many cases or funded groups to fund terrorists and then opened the door for them to attack.
[01:46:21.331 --> 01:46:24.694]  And that's just a fact, because they get more power and control.
[01:46:24.694 --> 01:46:32.140]  And when we got the MIAC and Homeland Security reports a year and a half ago, who was the number one target of the federal government and Homeland Security?
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:38.566]  And by the way, this was a reissuance of something put out in Bush's last year, but the right wing picked it up to say Obama did it.
[01:46:38.566 --> 01:46:39.507]  Well, no, he did do it.
[01:46:39.507 --> 01:46:42.970]  He continued it and accelerated it, but they're all part of the same team.
[01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:44.351]  That's the big message.
[01:46:44.351 --> 01:46:48.755]  That's the big issue here that everybody has got to understand right now.
[01:46:49.949 --> 01:46:50.109]  Yes.
[01:47:10.134 --> 01:47:11.735]  We're the people that see clearly.
[01:47:11.735 --> 01:47:13.136]  We are the enemy.
[01:47:13.136 --> 01:47:14.737]  All of this is for us.
[01:47:14.737 --> 01:47:18.419]  If you've got a portrait of John Wayne hanging in your house, folks, you're the enemy.
[01:47:18.419 --> 01:47:20.261]  And when I say that, I mean that.
[01:47:20.261 --> 01:47:24.443]  That is what they describe, quintessentially, as their enemy.
[01:47:24.443 --> 01:47:33.949]  If you're against welfare, corporate and individual, if you're against corruption and boss hog and big city systems of oppression, you're the enemy.
[01:47:33.949 --> 01:47:35.871]  If you're red-blooded, you're the enemy.
[01:47:36.894 --> 01:47:39.996]  You're the enemy because you're not going to go along with what's about to happen.
[01:47:39.996 --> 01:47:41.077]  You can skin a buck.
[01:47:41.077 --> 01:47:45.441]  You can run a trot line.
[01:47:45.441 --> 01:47:46.862]  You can make homemade wine.
[01:47:48.291 --> 01:47:51.834]  You've got a rifle, a shotgun, and a four-wheel drive.
[01:47:51.834 --> 01:47:53.196]  You've got to back 40.
[01:47:53.196 --> 01:47:56.118]  When they collapse society, you've always been the enemy.
[01:47:56.118 --> 01:47:59.281]  What's about to happen has been prepared for decades.
[01:47:59.281 --> 01:48:04.326]  They practiced over and over again in third world and first world and old world nations.
[01:48:04.326 --> 01:48:07.109]  Now they're going to do it in Europe, England, and the United States.
[01:48:07.629 --> 01:48:12.271]  Now they're about to bring in the greatest crisis to establish their world government.
[01:48:12.271 --> 01:48:19.334]  And if you could skin a buck and run a trot line and you're not going to turn your guns in, ladies and gentlemen, you're the ones they're coming after.
[01:48:19.334 --> 01:48:23.636]  You're the ones they've tried to twist the police to the dark side to think you're the enemy.
[01:48:23.636 --> 01:48:30.799]  But we're waking up the police and military and the globalists have overreached and we've got a good chance to blow up the Death Star.
[01:48:30.799 --> 01:48:33.280]  And I mean that figuratively, their whole system.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.381]  We are inside the superstructure right now.
[01:48:36.081 --> 01:48:42.107]  Ladies and gentlemen, and we are going in towards the reactor, and it is balls to the walls, 110%.
[01:48:42.107 --> 01:48:43.868]  This is it.
[01:48:43.868 --> 01:48:44.849]  This is history.
[01:48:44.849 --> 01:48:46.211]  You better understand that.
[01:48:46.211 --> 01:48:49.294]  The entire New World Order is focused on you, America.
[01:48:49.294 --> 01:48:51.496]  You can skin a buck, you can run a trot line.
[01:48:51.496 --> 01:48:52.677]  They hate your guts.
[01:48:52.677 --> 01:49:01.145]  Whether you live in Texas, or Michigan, or Northern California, or upstate New York, or the panhandle out in the boonies of Florida, or Iowa, or Illinois,
[01:49:01.565 --> 01:49:02.506]  Or Oklahoma.
[01:49:02.506 --> 01:49:04.108]  They hate your guts!
[01:49:04.108 --> 01:49:10.353]  You know who the Newell orders got up on the wall in their enemy meetings where they talk about it?
[01:49:10.353 --> 01:49:19.022]  They've had Frum, who's an admitted Bilderberg group member, writing articles about me every week in the last month saying I'm the number one enemy, and also going after Ron Paul and Rand Paul.
[01:49:20.011 --> 01:49:22.633]  They literally have got our photos up on the wall.
[01:49:22.633 --> 01:49:23.394]  We're it!
[01:49:23.394 --> 01:49:26.516]  We're all there is between total enslavement!
[01:49:26.516 --> 01:49:30.519]  And it's not that Ron Paul's perfect, or Alex Jones perfect, or that we're these great leaders.
[01:49:30.519 --> 01:49:39.627]  It's that we're the people that were at least real enough to have a focus, to stand up, to be involved, to speak out, to analyze the enemy attack profile correctly.
[01:49:39.627 --> 01:49:44.491]  We know exactly who the enemy are, and they can't stand it that we're communicating this information to you.
[01:49:45.529 --> 01:49:46.970]  I'm getting shells right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:48.271]  This is so real.
[01:49:48.271 --> 01:49:50.453]  And even I can't believe it's all coming to fruition.
[01:49:50.453 --> 01:49:54.235]  Even I can't believe this system is that corrupt and this evil.
[01:49:54.235 --> 01:49:55.416]  But it's real.
[01:49:55.416 --> 01:49:57.398]  It's happening.
[01:49:57.398 --> 01:49:59.099]  And so they're going to collapse the borders.
[01:49:59.099 --> 01:50:00.400]  They're going to collapse the dollar.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:02.581]  They're going to collapse the credit system.
[01:50:02.581 --> 01:50:06.664]  They are going to coast-to-coast lay off large portions of police and fire.
[01:50:06.664 --> 01:50:07.985]  It's already happening.
[01:50:07.985 --> 01:50:11.768]  And they are going to tell the public, as is in the case with Oakland,
[01:50:13.581 --> 01:50:18.725]  That they are not even going to respond to.
[01:50:18.725 --> 01:50:22.268]  These are the 40 things the police chief put out.
[01:50:22.268 --> 01:50:35.638]  Burglary, theft, embezzlement, grand theft, grand theft dog, identity theft, false information to peace officer, required to register a sex offender or arson offender, dump waste or offensive matter, discard appliance with lock, loud music.
[01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:38.252]  Possesses forged notes.
[01:50:38.252 --> 01:50:39.733]  Passed fictitious check.
[01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:41.895]  Obtained money by false voucher.
[01:50:41.895 --> 01:50:44.378]  Fraudulent use of access cards.
[01:50:44.378 --> 01:50:45.679]  Stolen license plates.
[01:50:45.679 --> 01:50:47.741]  Embezzlement by employee.
[01:50:47.741 --> 01:50:48.442]  Extortion.
[01:50:48.442 --> 01:50:49.423]  Attempted extortion.
[01:50:49.423 --> 01:50:51.926]  False personification of other.
[01:50:51.926 --> 01:50:54.809]  Injure telephone line or infrastructure.
[01:50:54.809 --> 01:50:56.510]  Interfere with power line.
[01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:57.952]  Poison people.
[01:50:57.952 --> 01:50:59.053]  Administer poison.
[01:51:00.214 --> 01:51:01.515]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.515 --> 01:51:07.098]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.098 --> 01:51:12.120]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:17.163]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:17.683 --> 01:51:22.927]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:22.927 --> 01:51:25.228]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:25.228 --> 01:51:30.031]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.031 --> 01:51:31.152]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.152 --> 01:51:33.934]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:33.934 --> 01:51:37.857]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:41.039]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:41.039 --> 01:51:43.260]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:44.181]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:47.823 --> 01:51:52.044]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:52.044 --> 01:51:56.885]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:56.885 --> 01:51:59.985]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:59.985 --> 01:52:02.526]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:52:02.526 --> 01:52:06.086]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:14.048]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:52:14.568 --> 01:52:20.054]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:52:20.054 --> 01:52:25.680]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:33.169]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:39.172]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:52:39.172 --> 01:52:40.993]  Our foods are their enemy.

[01:53:00.157 --> 01:53:05.360]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.060]  Listen.
[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:10.322]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:53:10.322 --> 01:53:13.724]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[01:53:13.724 --> 01:53:16.765]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[01:53:16.765 --> 01:53:20.127]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[01:53:20.549 --> 01:53:28.962]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[01:53:28.962 --> 01:53:31.525]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[01:53:31.525 --> 01:53:35.892]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.

[01:54:11.291 --> 01:54:12.672]  You didn't take any chances.
[01:54:12.672 --> 01:54:15.533]  You were a prisoner of doubt.
[01:54:15.533 --> 01:54:24.757]  If you sit on the fence, if you sit on the bench during this incredible battle for free humanity, we're going to lose.
[01:54:24.757 --> 01:54:30.740]  The only way the enemy can win is if you don't turn your liberty spirit loose.
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:36.243]  If you can just feel that strength of your ancestors rising in you to defend our women and our children,
[01:54:37.594 --> 01:54:42.599]  If you can commit, not care what your neighbors and people around you think, they will see the leadership.
[01:54:42.599 --> 01:54:46.003]  They will see the strength and they will stand up and be right beside you.
[01:54:47.694 --> 01:54:49.015]  Now I want to be clear here.
[01:54:49.015 --> 01:55:04.422]  They have decided that you're coddled, you're decadent, you're obsessed with the system, you're scared, they can hold your pension funds hostage a year and a half ago and steal trillions of dollars with a bailout, and they think you'll accept losing part of your pensions to quote, keep them.
[01:55:04.422 --> 01:55:06.143]  All of this is being announced now.
[01:55:06.143 --> 01:55:10.545]  They think that when they implode society and the police stop showing up at your house,
[01:55:11.465 --> 01:55:20.852]  That you're going to panic and become even more domesticated and say, I'll take carbon taxes, I'll do whatever you say, just turn the economy back on.
[01:55:20.852 --> 01:55:24.355]  I'll accept a war with Iran, just turn the economy back on.
[01:55:24.355 --> 01:55:26.177]  They are holding you hostage with the border.
[01:55:26.177 --> 01:55:27.498]  What did Obama tell Senator Kyle?
[01:55:28.171 --> 01:55:37.801]  We can't fix the border and all the deaths and the kidnapping because we need that as a crisis to get amnesty, which is the North American Union, the guest worker program, the wide open system.
[01:55:37.801 --> 01:55:46.110]  It's all stated by the public CFR report that they admit is word for word the legislation that Bush introduced three times and that Obama's introduced.
[01:55:47.358 --> 01:55:49.059]  It's word for word the same.
[01:55:49.059 --> 01:55:50.840]  It's congruency between them.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:52.521]  It just continues.
[01:55:52.521 --> 01:55:55.583]  And they know you're waking up and they know there's been a realignment.
[01:55:55.583 --> 01:56:06.029]  And so you think about the magnitude of that because not only is Oakland cutting cops and holding people hostage and saying we won't respond to robbery and muggings and poison.
[01:56:06.029 --> 01:56:08.971]  It says if you poison someone, they won't respond.
[01:56:08.971 --> 01:56:11.913]  And sabotaging power poles.
[01:56:11.913 --> 01:56:13.614]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:56:13.614 --> 01:56:14.975]  This is actually under the Patriot Act.
[01:56:15.635 --> 01:56:19.717]  But they're not going to enforce it because they want increased pay.
[01:56:19.717 --> 01:56:20.517]  They want increased money.
[01:56:20.517 --> 01:56:21.738]  They're holding you hostage.
[01:56:21.738 --> 01:56:23.378]  They're saying, we're not going to fix the roads.
[01:56:23.378 --> 01:56:25.319]  We're not going to put new police radios in.
[01:56:25.319 --> 01:56:29.501]  We're not going to do anything unless you capitulate and thumbprint to get guns.
[01:56:29.501 --> 01:56:33.523]  And they're actually increasing funding for anti-gun programs in California.
[01:56:33.523 --> 01:56:38.145]  I've talked to people I know that live in very wealthy neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills.
[01:56:38.145 --> 01:56:40.466]  And major roads washout a year ago?
[01:56:40.466 --> 01:56:41.386]  They don't fix them now.
[01:56:41.386 --> 01:56:42.527]  They just shut roads.
[01:56:42.527 --> 01:56:44.948]  They've announced in the LA Times they're not going to fix major roads.
[01:56:45.148 --> 01:56:45.288]  I think?
[01:57:10.379 --> 01:57:24.608]  So, police, starting in Chicago about 100 years ago, in New York in the last 70 or so, memos have even come out that have been in the news, and a police chief got recorded, what, 20-something years ago in Chicago saying, we're here to increase crime.
[01:57:24.608 --> 01:57:26.669]  We don't want to keep violent offenders.
[01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:32.713]  We want to get non-violent, and we need some criminals out there to scare the public to thinking they need us.
[01:57:33.772 --> 01:57:39.277]  Notice the more cops we get, we've got three times conservatively the police nationwide we had 15 years ago.
[01:57:39.277 --> 01:57:41.239]  They've tripled or more.
[01:57:41.239 --> 01:57:45.843]  But suddenly, folks, I had my car stolen, what, 15 years ago in Dallas.
[01:57:45.843 --> 01:57:47.845]  Then it got stolen a second time.
[01:57:47.845 --> 01:57:49.346]  I'd go up there and visit a girlfriend.
[01:57:49.346 --> 01:57:51.769]  Got stolen twice from a decent area of Dallas.
[01:57:51.769 --> 01:57:54.331]  The police wouldn't even show up.
[01:57:54.331 --> 01:57:58.235]  Wouldn't even show up to her apartment when it happened.
[01:57:59.241 --> 01:58:06.083]  And now they're just being public about the fact that they're there for revenue generation, and they're going to let society collapse.
[01:58:06.083 --> 01:58:09.404]  And these are coming in from Florida, these are coming in everywhere.
[01:58:09.404 --> 01:58:20.547]  They're saying burglary, theft, embezzlement, grand theft, extortion, embezzlement, attempted extortion, false persification of others.
[01:58:21.886 --> 01:58:23.547]  Injure telephone or power line.
[01:58:23.547 --> 01:58:25.028]  Interfere with power line.
[01:58:25.028 --> 01:58:27.250]  Unauthorized cable TV connection.
[01:58:27.250 --> 01:58:27.890]  Vandalism.
[01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:29.211]  So they mix petty things in.
[01:58:29.211 --> 01:58:32.453]  Administer exposed poison to another.
[01:58:32.453 --> 01:58:34.574]  Poisoning people is now okay.
[01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:35.775]  Do you understand?
[01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:38.257]  They are purposefully imploding the country.
[01:58:38.257 --> 01:58:46.182]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.928 --> 01:58:53.470]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:58:53.470 --> 01:58:54.731]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:54.731 --> 01:58:58.474]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:58.474 --> 01:59:00.916]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:00.916 --> 01:59:06.321]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:06.761 --> 01:59:13.451]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:13.451 --> 01:59:19.439]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:19.439 --> 01:59:23.105]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:59:23.585 --> 01:59:27.869]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:27.869 --> 01:59:33.834]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:33.834 --> 01:59:37.378]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:37.378 --> 01:59:39.359]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:39.359 --> 01:59:40.500]  It's here.

[01:59:52.361 --> 01:59:54.762]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.762 --> 02:00:04.267]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.267 --> 02:00:05.567]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.567 --> 02:00:07.348]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.348 --> 02:00:09.089]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.089 --> 02:00:10.690]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.690 --> 02:00:12.231]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.231 --> 02:00:16.433]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.433 --> 02:00:20.495]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.668 --> 02:00:25.331]  Now I've been telling you about the problem.
[02:00:25.331 --> 02:00:32.618]  How Obama admits he's allowing the border to collapse to create a crisis so he can form the SPP, the North American Union.
[02:00:32.618 --> 02:00:34.239]  Senator Kyle on record.
[02:00:34.239 --> 02:00:40.786]  How they're blocking the oil relief and not letting it be cleaned up, waiting for the hurricanes to blow it in to create a bigger crisis.
[02:00:40.786 --> 02:00:43.769]  Obama will be politically destroyed, but the globalists don't care.
[02:00:44.249 --> 02:00:59.103]  We've covered how the Financial Times of London and others are reporting Obama is in free fall and needs a staged terror attack like Oklahoma City or 9-11 to, quote, be a strong leader, to make us rally around him like a bunch of, you know, scared children.
[02:01:00.489 --> 02:01:17.062]  We know all over the country, every day I see reports where they're announcing they're laying off a third, a half, or more, or more of the police and saying the police are only allowed to revenue generate, we will not respond to robberies, to muggings, to home invasions, buy a gun.
[02:01:17.062 --> 02:01:21.025]  At least in Ohio and Michigan where they've announced this, they're saying buy a gun.
[02:01:21.025 --> 02:01:26.208]  Not in California, they're saying you're not gonna have a gun, we're gonna try to restrict that, and we're not gonna protect you.
[02:01:27.029 --> 02:01:28.991]  Unless you accept higher taxes.
[02:01:28.991 --> 02:01:32.134]  They raise the taxes and the economy implodes.
[02:01:32.134 --> 02:01:34.196]  They know it's going to do that.
[02:01:34.196 --> 02:01:43.025]  And they want to get all the parasites and all the dependents and all the little thugs that enjoy their petty power through the system and the uniforms that they animate.
[02:01:43.025 --> 02:01:45.428]  They want to get them all riled up and scared.
[02:01:47.364 --> 02:01:50.386]  So that they will go along with the oppression that's coming.
[02:01:50.386 --> 02:01:52.948]  They are going to shut off the power.
[02:01:52.948 --> 02:01:54.870]  They are going to increase the water prices.
[02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:57.572]  They are going to drive you into submission.
[02:01:57.572 --> 02:01:59.433]  They've done this in the third world.
[02:01:59.433 --> 02:02:00.754]  It's called shock therapy.
[02:02:00.754 --> 02:02:03.337]  This is a stated program, 100%.
[02:02:03.337 --> 02:02:07.420]  And we know what they are doing.
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:08.360]  And it is treason.
[02:02:09.301 --> 02:02:11.043]  It is outrageous.
[02:02:11.043 --> 02:02:18.909]  Those police officers should walk off the force and say, we're going to protest until you say that we're going to respond to crime.
[02:02:18.909 --> 02:02:22.652]  Again, we have triple the cops we had 15 years ago, conservatively.
[02:02:22.652 --> 02:02:25.675]  They're trying to expand them again with taxpayer money.
[02:02:25.675 --> 02:02:29.318]  And you can't get a cop when you need one most of the time in these big mega cities.
[02:02:29.318 --> 02:02:30.759]  A lot of towns are still decent.
[02:02:30.759 --> 02:02:35.002]  Austin, when I've needed the police, they've come out and been very nice and done a good job.
[02:02:36.244 --> 02:02:46.952]  But more and more in other areas of the country, we see where you call the police to your house, there's been a break-in, and they taser and beat up an old woman on squad car video.
[02:02:46.952 --> 02:02:52.157]  And in this latest case, they did the right thing and fired the cops, but who are these lunatics they're hiring?
[02:02:52.157 --> 02:02:53.918]  We obviously need police.
[02:02:53.918 --> 02:03:02.465]  I know it's a tough job, but we need a smaller, lean, focused, serious force that tracks down violent offenders and keeps them in jail.
[02:03:02.465 --> 02:03:04.067]  I mean, now, in Oakland,
[02:03:04.767 --> 02:03:06.509]  Here's the bigger issue.
[02:03:06.509 --> 02:03:17.300]  What happens when the Oakland Police Chief announces they won't respond to burglary, theft, embezzlement, grand theft auto, grand theft dog, identity theft, extortion, attempted extortion?
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:24.261]  Administer, expose, poison to another, vandalism.
[02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:25.262]  What is that message?
[02:03:25.262 --> 02:03:32.664]  I mean, it's almost like Devil's Night or something in Detroit, where all the criminals go out and burn things at once so the police can't respond.
[02:03:32.664 --> 02:03:36.265]  This is the police saying, we're going to take a hike, just like New Orleans.
[02:03:36.265 --> 02:03:48.209]  Instead, the cops were tying chains to jewelry stores and pawn shops, stealing guns and jewelry and dragging safes down the road behind them and going into Walmart and kicking everybody out looting so the cops can walk out with big screen TVs.
[02:03:48.209 --> 02:03:49.590]  I'm not here bashing police.
[02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:51.431]  I know they're the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:03:51.431 --> 02:03:53.033]  They're a mix, like everybody else.
[02:03:53.033 --> 02:03:54.895]  But they recruit slime.
[02:03:54.895 --> 02:03:56.336]  They recruit scum.
[02:03:56.336 --> 02:03:58.698]  They recruit people with low IQs.
[02:03:58.698 --> 02:04:00.600]  That's on record in many police departments.
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.882]  You can't have above an average IQ.
[02:04:02.882 --> 02:04:08.407]  Because with wisdom, most of the time comes decency and people being honorable.
[02:04:08.407 --> 02:04:10.989]  They want a bunch of dumb goons they can manipulate.
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:18.784]  And then if you get sick at a 9-11 rescue or you get sick cleaning up oil and you're begging for help as a cop, you're not gonna get it.
[02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:23.466]  And once you're not a cop anymore, once you're out of the military and the internal documents, you're the number one enemy.
[02:04:23.466 --> 02:04:25.247]  You're who the NSA is watching.
[02:04:25.247 --> 02:04:26.968]  You're the people they hate.
[02:04:26.968 --> 02:04:30.991]  It's time for everyone to make a decision and decide which side do you stand for.
[02:04:31.471 --> 02:04:32.731]  Which side are you on?
[02:04:32.731 --> 02:04:35.172]  The good news is there's a huge awakening to all this.
[02:04:35.172 --> 02:04:40.733]  But the larger question is, what are some things we can do that are real-world to counter this?
[02:04:40.733 --> 02:04:49.294]  And we'll talk about that after this break and have Jaron Neihardt in here with an amazing story he told me this morning, something I experienced last week.
[02:04:49.294 --> 02:04:55.095]  Then we've got Richard Reeves coming up, Larry Pratt, and we'll have some time in the middle of the next hour to take phone calls.
[02:04:55.095 --> 02:04:55.836]  Please stay with us.
[02:04:55.836 --> 02:04:58.096]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PresidentPlata.com.
[02:05:01.343 --> 02:05:05.304]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:05.304 --> 02:05:14.165]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:14.165 --> 02:05:18.806]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:18.806 --> 02:05:29.608]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:30.248 --> 02:05:39.777]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:39.777 --> 02:05:45.202]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[02:06:56.339 --> 02:06:58.081]  This information is too important to wait.
[02:06:58.988 --> 02:07:03.531]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:03.531 --> 02:07:04.451]  Number 1.
[02:07:04.451 --> 02:07:07.874]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:07.874 --> 02:07:08.734]  Number 2.
[02:07:08.734 --> 02:07:13.617]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:13.617 --> 02:07:14.378]  It's true.
[02:07:14.378 --> 02:07:19.241]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:19.241 --> 02:07:20.061]  Number 3.
[02:07:20.061 --> 02:07:23.664]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:23.664 --> 02:07:27.346]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:27.546 --> 02:07:28.347]  Number 4.
[02:07:28.347 --> 02:07:31.109]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:34.792]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:34.792 --> 02:07:35.593]  Number 5.
[02:07:35.593 --> 02:07:39.737]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:39.737 --> 02:07:44.501]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:44.781 --> 02:07:48.943]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:48.943 --> 02:07:50.744]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.744 --> 02:07:52.985]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:52.985 --> 02:07:55.826]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:55.826 --> 02:08:03.590]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:03.590 --> 02:08:06.311]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.285 --> 02:08:14.731]  The United States and the world is being collapsed so it can be reorganized under a planetary dictatorship.
[02:08:14.731 --> 02:08:19.635]  This is a public policy by the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, and countless others.
[02:08:19.635 --> 02:08:23.539]  They call it a planetary police state to carry out eugenics.
[02:08:25.111 --> 02:08:37.499]  We're gonna be discussing this and how we counter them and how we fight back and why I am coming out and saying that it's a 100% confirmed they are going ahead with this unless we get the word out like we never have before.
[02:08:37.499 --> 02:08:41.162]  And I'll explain that more and solutions to counter this in just a moment.
[02:08:41.162 --> 02:08:44.604]  First, I wanted to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[02:08:44.604 --> 02:08:45.324]  That's the website.
[02:08:45.324 --> 02:08:47.846]  You can call and get a free information pack by calling 877-327-0365.
[02:08:47.846 --> 02:08:49.207]  It's a wonderful plug-and-play solar-powered system.
[02:08:55.691 --> 02:08:57.471]  And our listeners have just loved them.
[02:08:57.471 --> 02:09:00.112]  We've been promoting them for almost three years now.
[02:09:00.112 --> 02:09:03.293]  And unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[02:09:03.293 --> 02:09:07.253]  You can get a bunch of them, run your whole house, or it's great for camping or a work shed.
[02:09:07.253 --> 02:09:07.874]  Great system.
[02:09:07.874 --> 02:09:15.495]  Find out more at mysolarbackup.com or get a free information package at 877-327-0365.
[02:09:15.495 --> 02:09:23.957]  And lastly, continuing with being self-sufficient, or at least partially self-sufficient and independent of the system that feeds off of you being dependent,
[02:09:24.477 --> 02:09:33.839]  This is the last day, July 14th, if you get the order in today, online or by calling, to get free shipping, which is a big part of the cost of high-quality storable foods, from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:09:33.839 --> 02:09:37.299]  The highest quality, the best prices, and free shipping, you can't beat it.
[02:09:37.299 --> 02:09:42.260]  efoodsdirect.com forward slash free ship, anywhere inside the continental United States.
[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:45.301]  efoodsdirect.com forward slash ship free, or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[02:09:52.123 --> 02:09:56.465]  The banners are also up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:56.465 --> 02:09:59.447]  You will never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:09:59.447 --> 02:10:00.848]  Now, I want to get into solutions.
[02:10:02.148 --> 02:10:13.598]  And the rest of this segment and then more coming up later in the hour after Richard Reeves leaves us, but that's also a big part of the solution when he's going to be here talking about what the biggest issue is being awake.
[02:10:13.598 --> 02:10:17.402]  And a big part of that is realizing how much power the individual has.
[02:10:17.402 --> 02:10:27.411]  The establishment wouldn't be moving to curtail the Internet and openly censor, quote, conspiracy theories, and they give the example at the White House and FCC of denying man-made global warming.
[02:10:29.071 --> 02:10:32.133]  Or denying the official story of 9-11.
[02:10:32.133 --> 02:10:34.435]  Or denying the official story of Oklahoma City.
[02:10:34.435 --> 02:10:36.357]  Or denying WMDs.
[02:10:36.357 --> 02:10:40.680]  Or they call it a conspiracy theory that China sells organs when China's on record saying they do.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:45.984]  These are the things the State Department and the FCC and the diversity czar at the White House have all said.
[02:10:45.984 --> 02:10:48.286]  It's what Cass Sunstein, the regulations czar, has said.
[02:10:48.286 --> 02:10:58.494]  Why would they want to start shutting down free speech and curtailing talk radio free speech with the Fairness Doctrine if, that's if, we weren't having an effect?
[02:10:59.830 --> 02:11:02.231]  And I'm only one person in this fight against the New World Order.
[02:11:02.231 --> 02:11:06.154]  The real power of this radio broadcast is you taking action.
[02:11:06.154 --> 02:11:20.883]  And if we're able to expose that the private central banks orchestrated the collapse, if we're able to expose their lying about WMDs with Iran, just like they did seven years ago with Iraq, if we're able to expose the fact that they're holding us hostage with the open borders, and that it's their policy to have them open,
[02:11:21.303 --> 02:11:22.804]  Their arrogance is what's going to undo them.
[02:11:22.804 --> 02:11:25.246]  That Obama admits he wants the crisis to get worse.
[02:11:25.246 --> 02:11:32.532]  That they're trying to bankrupt states with unfunded mandates so they can be federalized and thus internationalized.
[02:11:32.532 --> 02:11:34.474]  All of this is admitted.
[02:11:34.474 --> 02:11:36.095]  And they want you to feel powerless.
[02:11:36.095 --> 02:11:38.177]  But ladies and gentlemen, I know the power of the individual.
[02:11:38.737 --> 02:11:43.740]  Fifteen years ago, when I first got on air, I just wanted to fight for the Second Amendment, be one voice of millions.
[02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:46.722]  I never had any imagination of even having a radio show.
[02:11:46.722 --> 02:11:49.744]  Did an access show for a few months.
[02:11:49.744 --> 02:11:51.065]  Local station went to talk.
[02:11:51.065 --> 02:11:52.686]  They said, we'd like to give you a Saturday show.
[02:11:52.686 --> 02:11:53.927]  It got a lot of listeners and ratings.
[02:11:53.927 --> 02:11:55.328]  They gave me a weekday show.
[02:11:55.328 --> 02:11:56.589]  Then it got syndicated 13 years ago.
[02:11:58.190 --> 02:11:59.171]  That's another example.
[02:11:59.171 --> 02:12:09.720]  When I started InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, I had no intention of them being the number one alternative websites, number one and number two in the world, and growing exponentially.
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:15.525]  But it just shows with how if you just start resisting in a small way, that's how you'll get better.
[02:12:15.525 --> 02:12:19.048]  And there's so many of us that we're unstoppable if we take action.
[02:12:19.048 --> 02:12:23.251]  Now, again, think about just what I've done with the films.
[02:12:23.251 --> 02:12:25.834]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions of free views online.
[02:12:26.755 --> 02:12:28.376]  That's what I value is waking people up.
[02:12:28.376 --> 02:12:29.637]  The Obama deception.
[02:12:29.637 --> 02:12:31.298]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:12:31.298 --> 02:12:32.559]  Endgame.
[02:12:32.559 --> 02:12:33.499]  All of these films.
[02:12:33.499 --> 02:12:34.860]  Invisible Empire.
[02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:35.661]  Truth Rising.
[02:12:35.661 --> 02:12:37.842]  Loose Change Final Cut that I produced.
[02:12:37.842 --> 02:12:38.943]  All of that.
[02:12:38.943 --> 02:12:41.345]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions conservatively.
[02:12:41.345 --> 02:12:43.146]  I have more than 8 YouTube channels.
[02:12:43.146 --> 02:12:46.388]  With more than 150 million views between them.
[02:12:46.388 --> 02:12:48.369]  Not counting the thousands of other channels.
[02:12:48.369 --> 02:12:50.050]  And hundreds of millions of views.
[02:12:50.050 --> 02:12:51.051]  That's just with YouTube.
[02:12:51.051 --> 02:12:51.972]  And we use other tools.
[02:12:51.972 --> 02:12:53.252]  Talk radio.
[02:12:53.252 --> 02:12:53.633]  Everything.
[02:12:54.537 --> 02:12:56.078]  The news websites.
[02:12:56.078 --> 02:12:56.898]  Think of what we've done.
[02:12:56.898 --> 02:13:14.444]  And here's just a few examples of why enemy operatives, COINTELPRO, are revealing themselves in the fake patriot movement, that is, areas that are fake, in the mainstream media, multiple Bilderberg Group journalists openly attacking me every week, and international publications saying I'm a dangerous enemy.
[02:13:14.444 --> 02:13:18.465]  Because I've analyzed their attack profile, I know what they're doing, and I know how to stop them.
[02:13:19.085 --> 02:13:25.527]  Now here's just an example of the power of the individual and how it ties together with you, the listeners.
[02:13:25.527 --> 02:13:27.828]  How it ties together with you, the power.
[02:13:27.828 --> 02:13:33.830]  The reason this show has power is because I take action, we put out quality information, but that's a small part of the equation.
[02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:36.090]  You magnify it a billion times.
[02:13:36.090 --> 02:13:37.051]  No exaggeration.
[02:13:37.051 --> 02:13:40.412]  A billion times conservatively, you magnify what I do.
[02:13:41.152 --> 02:13:45.935]  And an example of that is I came in here last week and told the crew and then said on air that it was weird.
[02:13:45.935 --> 02:13:50.958]  I was listening to a syndicated show out of San Antonio and they were talking about me in a positive way.
[02:13:50.958 --> 02:13:57.242]  And then I flipped the channel to 590 AM and the Todd and Don Show had a caller call in and said they want to censor the internet.
[02:13:57.242 --> 02:13:58.743]  The world government's taking over.
[02:13:58.743 --> 02:14:00.484]  They want to shut down Alex Jones.
[02:14:00.484 --> 02:14:02.705]  And you know the local host made a joke about it.
[02:14:02.705 --> 02:14:07.028]  But the point is that that was just in a few minutes of listening.
[02:14:07.848 --> 02:14:09.609]  I was tuning channel-to-channel.
[02:14:09.609 --> 02:14:11.070]  Jaron called me this morning at about 9.
[02:14:11.070 --> 02:14:22.098]  He said, you won't believe what just happened to me this morning because he'd just woken up and he was dazed by it because every piece of media, his cell phone, his computer, his radio, it was all Alex Jones.
[02:14:22.098 --> 02:14:23.199]  No matter what he flipped to,
[02:14:24.059 --> 02:14:26.980]  Not twice in a row, three times in a row.
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:37.382]  And that's an example of you, the callers, just calling in to talk radio and the type of magnification that it is having and the buzz that it is creating.
[02:14:37.382 --> 02:14:43.843]  If we take that model and you do that yourself in your own town, your own city, it may just be a buzz on your block.
[02:14:43.843 --> 02:14:45.684]  It may be a buzz in your town or your state.
[02:14:47.020 --> 02:14:48.781]  Resistance is victory.
[02:14:48.781 --> 02:14:51.342]  And I want to go to Jaron Neihardt and talk about this.
[02:14:51.342 --> 02:14:53.403]  Jaron, briefly tell folks what happened this morning.
[02:14:53.403 --> 02:14:55.044]  Yeah, actually I woke up about 8 o'clock.
[02:14:55.044 --> 02:15:00.046]  I always set my alarm clock to 93.7, a local show here in town, Dudley and Bob.
[02:15:00.046 --> 02:15:04.228]  And a caller actually called in asking if they could get you on the show.
[02:15:04.228 --> 02:15:08.631]  They were talking about the FCC ruling, the ruling against the FCC.
[02:15:08.631 --> 02:15:12.192]  They went on for about five minutes saying, yeah, we should have them back in talking about you.
[02:15:12.192 --> 02:15:13.333]  I turned that off.
[02:15:13.673 --> 02:15:13.953]  I don't
[02:15:34.022 --> 02:15:39.205]  Joe Rogan's on his podcast talking about you, doing an impression actually, but talking about you.
[02:15:39.205 --> 02:15:41.627]  It almost short-circuited me for a second.
[02:15:41.627 --> 02:15:48.711]  The thing was, he's got people on his podcast, the UFC guy Eddie Bravo, they all talk about you like, just Alex.
[02:15:48.711 --> 02:15:51.753]  Hey, Alex does this, Alex does this, and everybody seems to know.
[02:15:51.753 --> 02:15:53.634]  It was the same thing on KLBJ when I heard it.
[02:15:53.634 --> 02:15:59.938]  I didn't hear the Case 101 part, but they just talk about, yeah, Alex comes in, Alex does this, and it's almost like just a...
[02:16:00.578 --> 02:16:01.459]  Everybody's aware.
[02:16:01.459 --> 02:16:03.640]  I see it when, you know, when the Drudge Report comes out.
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:04.861]  I didn't even tell you this the other day.
[02:16:04.861 --> 02:16:11.286]  I Google search every morning just New World Order, global governance to see what articles it comes up in.
[02:16:11.286 --> 02:16:16.870]  And two days ago it sent me to a link, a TMZ link about Jesse James.
[02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:25.196]  It had no relevance to anything and I actually controlled F, searched it to see where New World Order popped up and somebody had posted an InfoWars story in the comments section.
[02:16:26.197 --> 02:16:43.080]  By JT Coyote a couple of days ago, so it's just everywhere you turn the message is getting out That's just you know just the the viral nature of it It's just kind of fascinating but and within about a minute of itself three times today on three separate radio shows They were talking about you
[02:16:44.336 --> 02:16:45.957]  And this was one after the other.
[02:16:45.957 --> 02:16:46.217]  Oh, yeah.
[02:16:46.217 --> 02:16:48.799]  I mean, you're just like, because I mean, I'm in the car and I go to one channel.
[02:16:48.799 --> 02:16:53.201]  They're talking about me and I and then and then I flip to another and they're talking about me.
[02:16:53.201 --> 02:16:55.263]  And I didn't I mean, it was just insane.
[02:16:55.263 --> 02:16:56.784]  And more and more that's happening.
[02:16:56.784 --> 02:17:00.306]  And I'm hearing from family and friends and other parts of the country.
[02:17:00.306 --> 02:17:02.307]  I'm hearing of people in other nations.
[02:17:02.307 --> 02:17:04.948]  I'm hearing in Czechoslovakia and Russia and Japan.
[02:17:04.948 --> 02:17:06.329]  It's info wars everywhere.
[02:17:06.329 --> 02:17:10.432]  And and but but but the issue is, it's not about Alex Jones.
[02:17:11.312 --> 02:17:15.574]  It's about the power of individuals together with an idea and how ideas are bulletproof.
[02:17:15.574 --> 02:17:16.994]  They can kill Alex Jones.
[02:17:16.994 --> 02:17:20.596]  I've been getting death threats and a lot of other stuff lately, but I'm not scared of that.
[02:17:20.596 --> 02:17:36.263]  My mission is to defeat the New World Order so my children have a future and so my great-great-grandchildren can look at a hologram photo of me or whatever they're looking at in the future and go, you know, we're proud of him, you know, we, you know, and then I can be an example to them just like my ancestors were an example to me.
[02:17:37.103 --> 02:17:37.163]  And
[02:17:55.794 --> 02:17:57.296]  I mean, I'm not sitting here tooting my horn.
[02:17:57.296 --> 02:17:58.998]  Everybody has that in their background.
[02:17:58.998 --> 02:18:00.139]  I want my ancestors.
[02:18:00.139 --> 02:18:01.581]  I mean, I want to keep living.
[02:18:01.581 --> 02:18:02.341]  I don't want to die.
[02:18:02.341 --> 02:18:03.823]  But I'm actually not even afraid.
[02:18:03.823 --> 02:18:04.544]  I'm really living.
[02:18:04.544 --> 02:18:07.767]  This is, as a man, I am supposed to stand up for humanity.
[02:18:07.767 --> 02:18:09.269]  I'm supposed to stand up against evil.
[02:18:09.269 --> 02:18:10.631]  I'm not supposed to be a coward.
[02:18:10.631 --> 02:18:11.251]  And the weird thing is...
[02:18:11.972 --> 02:18:16.734]  I might have been scared 15 years ago a little bit, maybe scared to get in front of a crowd more than I was scared of getting killed.
[02:18:16.734 --> 02:18:17.955]  I wasn't even thinking about that.
[02:18:17.955 --> 02:18:19.776]  Now I'm not even worried.
[02:18:19.776 --> 02:18:21.917]  And I kind of got to remember, well, I want to continue my mission.
[02:18:21.917 --> 02:18:23.498]  I need to kind of look over my shoulder.
[02:18:23.498 --> 02:18:24.718]  I need to still watch out.
[02:18:24.718 --> 02:18:25.599]  But I'm not.
[02:18:25.599 --> 02:18:32.562]  It's such an empowering feeling to know we've got the truth, to know we're having a historic effect and the system is fully aware.
[02:18:32.562 --> 02:18:34.303]  That's why they've had two separate journalists.
[02:18:35.051 --> 02:18:40.897]  And Watson's written about this in international publications write whole stories about me and how dangerous I am.
[02:18:40.897 --> 02:18:47.583]  So literally the global rulers are in their councils saying we've got to stop Alex Jones, but how do we do it?
[02:18:47.583 --> 02:18:48.264]  Do we poison him?
[02:18:48.264 --> 02:18:49.185]  Do we kill him?
[02:18:49.185 --> 02:18:51.887]  No, let's destroy him and call him a racist when we never do that.
[02:18:51.887 --> 02:18:59.375]  Then they have their racist groups, their funding that's on record attacking me saying, you know, I'm a sellout because I'm not a racist as if being good as being a racist.
[02:18:59.915 --> 02:19:06.720]  So, I mean, literally, ladies and gentlemen, you can do the same thing at your church, at your business, in your life.
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:07.640]  You can be the leaders.
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:10.262]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young, male, female.
[02:19:10.262 --> 02:19:10.982]  It doesn't matter.
[02:19:10.982 --> 02:19:14.705]  A deciding crossroads is here upon us now.
[02:19:14.705 --> 02:19:24.892]  And if we want to stop this global financial meltdown, if we want to stop this orchestrated implosion, if we want to stop this tyranny, we have to stand together as a free society and realize that we do have power.
[02:19:25.732 --> 02:19:35.802]  Yeah, actually to the viral nature of it, we had Patrice O'Neill on about a year ago, and the reason we found out about that, a listener, he was on the Opie and Anthony Show explaining the Obama deception to him.
[02:19:35.802 --> 02:19:37.283]  So it's just a message getting out.
[02:19:37.283 --> 02:19:41.748]  We have pop culture magazines in England coming to us, newspapers in Greece daily.
[02:19:41.748 --> 02:19:47.013]  We have a ton of other media asking if we have contact for our guests.
[02:19:47.013 --> 02:19:48.134]  Everybody wants this information.
[02:19:48.254 --> 02:19:53.460]  And I just, I'm turning down the History Channel for a big interview, because literally, they don't matter now.
[02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:55.943]  It's this information that matters, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:55.943 --> 02:19:57.204]  We're having victories.
[02:19:57.204 --> 02:19:57.785]  Good job, Jaren.
[02:19:57.785 --> 02:19:58.305]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:00.677 --> 02:20:01.918]  Global meltdowns.
[02:20:01.918 --> 02:20:03.318]  Massive unemployment.
[02:20:03.318 --> 02:20:04.539]  Endless wars.
[02:20:04.539 --> 02:20:06.179]  A new currency crisis.
[02:20:06.179 --> 02:20:08.260]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:10.421]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:10.421 --> 02:20:12.322]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:20:12.322 --> 02:20:14.403]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[02:20:14.403 --> 02:20:16.384]  Introducing Off The Grid News.

[02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:07.705]  Gulf War vets, 9-11 workers, people around the Gulf oil spill fumes, all were exposed to toxic chemicals in the air and became ill.
[02:23:07.705 --> 02:23:10.367]  Even in your home, air contamination can make you sick.

[02:23:17.812 --> 02:23:18.813]  Protect yourself.
[02:23:18.813 --> 02:23:21.114]  You cannot trust anyone to do it for you.

[02:23:56.964 --> 02:23:58.625]  Your trusted advisor for clean air.
[02:24:05.126 --> 02:24:14.632]  My friends, the giant effect we've had and the exponential growth curve of our power to reach people is a great boon for liberty, but it's also a danger.
[02:24:14.632 --> 02:24:21.537]  Because if they can successfully destroy Alex Jones, they can attempt to wound the idea of the resistance.
[02:24:21.537 --> 02:24:22.558]  And I've always attempted
[02:24:23.158 --> 02:24:27.419]  To not be in this leadership position, but there's no denying it, and it's exponential.
[02:24:27.419 --> 02:24:32.680]  And I pray every day that God strengthens me and helps me be somewhat worthy of this position.
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:41.541]  But all of us are in this special position in this time and space, in the time-space continuum, of having a serious choice, liberty or tyranny.
[02:24:41.541 --> 02:24:48.903]  I was talking to Richard Reeves, another great activist that I've known for years, who's just gone on, with my encouragement and others, to just do amazing things.
[02:24:48.903 --> 02:24:50.803]  He's been to Bilderberg with us to cover it.
[02:24:51.783 --> 02:24:52.084]  I think?
[02:25:10.296 --> 02:25:11.176]  This is happening.
[02:25:11.176 --> 02:25:13.917]  So I want to get him here, because he's an expert on the realignment that's happening.
[02:25:13.917 --> 02:25:16.078]  He saw it a year and a half ago, as I did.
[02:25:16.078 --> 02:25:19.518]  And also on the toll roads, because they're going ahead with the Napa Superhighways.
[02:25:19.518 --> 02:25:21.439]  They've changed the name.
[02:25:21.439 --> 02:25:25.480]  These are international zones to raise taxes for these international groups.
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:26.580]  So are the carbon taxes.
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:28.921]  So we're going to discuss that after the break.
[02:25:28.921 --> 02:25:32.042]  But Richard also brought to my attention a chilling Obama quote.
[02:25:32.042 --> 02:25:33.182]  He said, I'm sure you know about it.
[02:25:33.182 --> 02:25:34.642]  It came out a week ago or so.
[02:25:34.642 --> 02:25:36.043]  And I said, no, I'm not aware of it.
[02:25:36.043 --> 02:25:37.143]  See, that's why you, the listeners,
[02:25:37.683 --> 02:25:39.144]  And the other activists are so important.
[02:25:39.144 --> 02:25:42.206]  None of us can know all of this or even half of it.
[02:25:42.206 --> 02:25:52.592]  But Richard, you've heard me on the show say, and I know I'm right, 100% chance they're going to fully implode things to a road warrior level, many times worse than the Great Depression.
[02:25:53.112 --> 02:25:57.554]  They think because we're dependent and they've gotten us dependent that we'll have to submit to them.
[02:25:57.554 --> 02:26:03.057]  They're announcing police aren't going to respond to robberies, people being poisoned, people being attacked.
[02:26:03.057 --> 02:26:05.038]  That's happening all over the country.
[02:26:05.038 --> 02:26:08.859]  They're training us that your taxes are going up, but we're going to let lawlessness take over.
[02:26:08.859 --> 02:26:09.800]  The border's lawless.
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:12.841]  Obama says he wants it lawless to Senator Kyle.
[02:26:12.841 --> 02:26:14.062]  So people will capitulate.
[02:26:14.582 --> 02:26:17.004]  I mean, but the good news is they're in trouble.
[02:26:17.004 --> 02:26:18.365]  People say, well, what's the solution?
[02:26:18.365 --> 02:26:19.326]  It's screaming bloody murder.
[02:26:19.326 --> 02:26:21.248]  It's saying, we know you're doing this deliberately.
[02:26:21.248 --> 02:26:22.409]  You're criminals.
[02:26:22.409 --> 02:26:25.972]  And we know the Republican leadership is involved in it as well.
[02:26:25.972 --> 02:26:30.196]  And just identifying them as the treacherous, larcenous traitors they are.
[02:26:30.196 --> 02:26:39.665]  Richard Reeves, give us the State of the Union and the State of the Globe from your research, because you're a radio talk show host, author, researcher, activist, one of the key people fighting the trans-Texas corridor.
[02:26:40.225 --> 02:26:43.962]  Well, Alex, thank you for having me on and I tell you we are in a definite.
[02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:46.541]  At the edge of a cliff right here.
[02:26:46.541 --> 02:26:47.342]  I think you're right.
[02:26:47.342 --> 02:26:47.842]  Absolutely.
[02:26:47.842 --> 02:26:49.504]  Because they do see the awakening.
[02:26:49.504 --> 02:26:53.487]  I think we had Brzezinski talk about that the global awakening is going on.
[02:26:53.487 --> 02:27:02.173]  We had a Henry Kissinger quote come out that if the Euro collapses over in the European Union, if that comes apart, the New World Order could be lost right now.
[02:27:02.173 --> 02:27:03.995]  But I don't think they're ready to give it up that quick.
[02:27:03.995 --> 02:27:08.018]  They are definitely ready to potentially pull the plug on us here.
[02:27:08.018 --> 02:27:10.080]  And I think one thing we could discuss through the next
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:11.140]  That's what the IMF
[02:27:35.646 --> 02:27:36.147]  I don't
[02:27:52.106 --> 02:27:55.909]  Talk about Alex Jones, Infowars, and the Patriot Movement, Tea Party, etc.
[02:27:55.909 --> 02:27:57.210]  was just blowing up.
[02:27:57.210 --> 02:28:09.079]  Well, that's one thing that I've noticed that years ago, back in the late 90s, early 2000, stories that were discussed here in the alternative media sometimes took the mainstream media 2, 3, 4, 5 years
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:13.761]  In some cases, they didn't talk about a story that we talked about.
[02:28:13.761 --> 02:28:18.302]  Now they admit on Fox and CNN, Prozac does cause brain cancer and heart attacks.
[02:28:18.302 --> 02:28:26.663]  They admit, OK, it is causing miscarriages and for babies to be underweight and deformed with the aspartame, which we knew back in the 70s that was in the studies.
[02:28:26.663 --> 02:28:27.364]  I mean, exactly.
[02:28:27.364 --> 02:28:29.024]  It's just kind of out there now.
[02:28:29.024 --> 02:28:38.906]  Well, when it comes to the political realities of this world, the zeitgeist of it is flying right through this office because it's like just yesterday on USA Today, yesterday, front page.
[02:28:39.446 --> 02:28:43.489]  Full-body scanners being protested against right there on the front page.
[02:28:43.489 --> 02:28:47.952]  They're talking about a story where full-body scanners at the airports that people are upset.
[02:28:47.952 --> 02:28:52.575]  I said meeting massive resistance and it's and I have another report here.
[02:28:52.575 --> 02:28:54.497]  Freeway speed cameras to be turned off.
[02:28:54.497 --> 02:29:04.304]  This is out of the Arizona newspaper, Arizona Republic, and it says because almost everyone refused to pay over 90% of people refused to pay the tickets.
[02:29:04.804 --> 02:29:05.445]  Right.
[02:29:05.445 --> 02:29:06.446]  So that's what it's going to take.
[02:29:06.446 --> 02:29:09.831]  It's going to take some civil disobedience at some point.
[02:29:09.831 --> 02:29:14.817]  But I think we still have, just by hanging by a thread, we've got the voting still hanging by a thread.
[02:29:14.817 --> 02:29:16.519]  We had the Rand Paul victory.
[02:29:16.519 --> 02:29:20.224]  We've got other victories that have happened in these primaries.
[02:29:20.224 --> 02:29:22.326]  Like you said, a lot of incumbents are going by the wayside.
[02:29:22.827 --> 02:29:23.107]  I don't know.
[02:29:50.083 --> 02:29:54.016]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.016 --> 02:29:56.725]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:32.667 --> 02:32:37.070]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:42.395]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.

[02:33:06.148 --> 02:33:10.572]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:33:24.188 --> 02:33:30.270]  Then Larry Pratt, the head of Gunners of America with key intel on the enemy operations against the Second Amendment.
[02:33:30.270 --> 02:33:33.671]  There's been some good news but also some very bad news.
[02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:35.212]  We're talking about solutions.
[02:33:35.832 --> 02:33:38.053]  Countering this globalist onslaught.
[02:33:38.053 --> 02:33:41.035]  That's how they take down old world and first world nations.
[02:33:41.035 --> 02:33:47.559]  They have a hundred point plus IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, OECD battle plan.
[02:33:47.559 --> 02:33:48.839]  These are public.
[02:33:48.839 --> 02:33:50.240]  They are doing it here.
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:52.221]  We know exactly what they're doing.
[02:33:52.221 --> 02:33:56.324]  But if we screw around and call the conspiracy theory, the media, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:33:56.324 --> 02:33:57.024]  Now they're not doing that.
[02:33:57.024 --> 02:34:01.527]  They go, okay, it is a world government and we are going to get rid of most of the police and let criminals rob you.
[02:34:02.587 --> 02:34:06.789]  You know, and we are going to put carbon taxes on you and raise your taxes, even though it'll destroy society.
[02:34:06.789 --> 02:34:08.350]  It's okay.
[02:34:08.350 --> 02:34:15.413]  We've got to stand up and say no, no, no, no, no, and act like leaders.
[02:34:15.413 --> 02:34:16.414]  We need to be confident.
[02:34:16.414 --> 02:34:20.696]  You know, the media is trying to be like, I know this sounds like a conspiracy, but the government might be corrupt.
[02:34:20.696 --> 02:34:21.396]  I mean, come on.
[02:34:21.676 --> 02:34:23.437]  We're light years past that now.
[02:34:23.437 --> 02:34:25.219]  There's not time to screw around.
[02:34:25.219 --> 02:34:27.241]  You're living in the middle of a war.
[02:34:27.241 --> 02:34:29.322]  You're living in the middle of history right now.
[02:34:29.322 --> 02:34:36.488]  I'm not risking my life here, and I wasn't up here until 10 o'clock last night, working 14-hour day, busting my butt to play games.
[02:34:36.488 --> 02:34:39.290]  I know how real this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:39.290 --> 02:34:44.575]  The real world's going on around you, and it's not about LeBron James or Lindsay Lohan or Mel Gibson.
[02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:47.917]  It's about how you're being enslaved and future generations are going to be enslaved.
[02:34:47.917 --> 02:34:48.878]  We don't stop this.
[02:34:48.878 --> 02:34:50.660]  And what's the biggest tool we've got in the fight?
[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:53.422]  It's the documentary films.
[02:34:53.422 --> 02:35:00.828]  Rise of the Republic, Don't Tread on Me, How to Take the States Back at the Legislature and the County Level with the Sheriff, and more.
[02:35:00.828 --> 02:35:04.932]  Invisible Empire, A New Order to Find, exposing who these creatures are and what their plan is.
[02:35:04.932 --> 02:35:05.833]  Our latest film.
[02:35:05.833 --> 02:35:09.736]  Endgame, Blueprint from Global Enslavement, almost three hour film detailing their entire agenda.
[02:35:09.736 --> 02:35:11.078]  You want a master's degree in it?
[02:35:11.078 --> 02:35:11.458]  Here it is.
[02:35:11.818 --> 02:35:16.943]  The Secret of Oz, what the bankers are doing and solutions to defeat them from the makers of the Money Masters.
[02:35:16.943 --> 02:35:19.866]  The Obama Deception, you want to shatter the left-right paradigm?
[02:35:19.866 --> 02:35:25.531]  Leftist and right-wingers will watch this, thinking it's a left-right paradigm film, and they'll have their conditioning broken.
[02:35:25.531 --> 02:35:30.015]  This film, conservatively more than 25 to 30 million free downloads online.
[02:35:30.015 --> 02:35:32.798]  Buy the DVD and the highest quality, make copies, get it out to everyone.
[02:35:33.238 --> 02:35:35.321]  All available at Infowars.com.
[02:35:35.321 --> 02:35:42.892]  Over 90% of the calls and on-the-street contacts and letters I get, and people I talk to that talk to others that have woken up, say it's from the films.
[02:35:42.892 --> 02:35:43.793]  The films.
[02:35:43.793 --> 02:35:44.694]  The films.
[02:35:44.694 --> 02:35:45.235]  The films.
[02:35:45.235 --> 02:35:48.019]  You may know all about this, you know more than I and Richard Reeves combined.
[02:35:48.965 --> 02:35:49.946]  But does your neighbor?
[02:35:49.946 --> 02:35:50.727]  Does your family?
[02:35:50.727 --> 02:35:53.189]  They're ready to be awakened now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:53.189 --> 02:35:54.470]  It's an info war.
[02:35:54.470 --> 02:35:55.511]  We want to keep it that way.
[02:35:55.511 --> 02:35:57.492]  The globalists want to make it a physical war.
[02:35:57.492 --> 02:35:59.394]  They're waging war on you with crime.
[02:35:59.394 --> 02:36:01.415]  They've always let the violent offenders go.
[02:36:01.415 --> 02:36:05.219]  Did you know somebody convicted of pot stays in longer than somebody convicted of robbery?
[02:36:05.879 --> 02:36:14.462]  You know, just like in Denver, the old 82-year-old veteran's getting robbed and they're trying to run him over in his yard so he shoots one of the illegal aliens and they let them go and charge him with murder.
[02:36:14.462 --> 02:36:18.523]  They want you to be a slave, the productive good people.
[02:36:18.523 --> 02:36:23.425]  You've got to reach out with these films and you also fund us when you do that with the PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:36:24.065 --> 02:36:31.731]  Where we simulcast the show and all the films in high quality, download them, burn them to disk, or the high quality DVDs at the online shopping carts at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:31.731 --> 02:36:37.376]  The t-shirts, all of it's about getting the word out, identifying as patriots, getting together.
[02:36:37.376 --> 02:36:37.956]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:37.956 --> 02:36:38.977]  Or write to me, PO Box 19549, Austin, TX 78760.
[02:36:38.977 --> 02:36:40.458]  And I want to say this right now.
[02:36:40.458 --> 02:36:42.780]  I couldn't have done any of this in the last 15 years without you.
[02:36:53.749 --> 02:36:54.670]  Okay.
[02:36:54.670 --> 02:36:57.853]  And the globalists are going to try to confuse you on the web and get you to end fight.
[02:36:57.853 --> 02:36:59.094]  And that's what I love about Richard.
[02:36:59.094 --> 02:37:00.355]  He's immune to it.
[02:37:00.355 --> 02:37:06.520]  And distract off and make the fight about a fight with each other instead of waking more people up.
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:08.442]  It's a life and death situation.
[02:37:08.442 --> 02:37:12.145]  And I want to commend all of you because we are kicking the globalist hind end.
[02:37:12.145 --> 02:37:15.027]  But the problem is the empire is now striking back.
[02:37:15.027 --> 02:37:21.353]  Richard, you've got the floor about the Kissinger quote, this Obama clip, the toll roads, everything we're going to talk about.
[02:37:21.813 --> 02:37:24.354]  Solutions, but also who the enemy is right now.
[02:37:24.354 --> 02:37:26.115]  What do you want to cover first?
[02:37:26.115 --> 02:37:28.376]  Well, first of all, I want to back up what you just said.
[02:37:28.376 --> 02:37:35.659]  Infowarrior is essential right now because if we have this economic collapse that you're talking about and that I think very well could be coming as well.
[02:37:36.659 --> 02:37:40.402]  We need to have our neighbors knowing who's really the culprit.
[02:37:40.402 --> 02:37:41.783]  You know, is it the middle class?
[02:37:41.783 --> 02:37:43.504]  Is it the guy down the street?
[02:37:43.504 --> 02:37:44.265]  No, it's not.
[02:37:44.265 --> 02:37:48.128]  It's the global elite that's doing this economic hit on the United States.
[02:37:48.128 --> 02:37:54.352]  So we need to Infowarrior, times two, times ten, whatever you're doing now, folks, amp it up.
[02:37:54.352 --> 02:37:59.276]  And the New World Order, they fund their operation out of thin air, paper, and ink.
[02:37:59.276 --> 02:38:03.419]  In zeros and ones in a computer that doesn't even exist in reality.
[02:38:03.419 --> 02:38:04.640]  That's how they fund their efforts.
[02:38:05.416 --> 02:38:09.359]  Folks, Alex needs help to fund these efforts and continue this going on.
[02:38:09.359 --> 02:38:15.043]  All right, I'll tell you, one of the quotes I thought you'd be really interested with this oil well situation is Mikhail Gorbachev.
[02:38:15.043 --> 02:38:21.909]  The threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key that will unlock the new world order.
[02:38:21.909 --> 02:38:23.210]  So that plays right into this oil well.
[02:38:23.210 --> 02:38:24.971]  And that was published in newspapers.
[02:38:24.971 --> 02:38:30.395]  That was a 1988 quote, way back from 88, supposedly December, UN General Assembly.
[02:38:30.395 --> 02:38:30.956]  Read that again.
[02:38:31.636 --> 02:38:43.383]  The threat, and I would say the implementation is probably the new word there, but the threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key that will unlock the New World Order.
[02:38:43.383 --> 02:38:47.906]  Maurice Strong quote, the environmental crisis is the cornerstone of the New World Order.
[02:38:47.906 --> 02:38:54.370]  So Al Gore, Maurice Strong, and Mikhail Gorbachev are the three musketeers of the environmental movement.
[02:38:54.370 --> 02:39:00.193]  So the New World Order is using that leg right now, but there's other legs obviously going on besides the environmental crisis.
[02:39:00.193 --> 02:39:01.234]  But I thought with this oil well,
[02:39:01.374 --> 02:39:03.176]  We're already in a depression but that means total collapse.
[02:39:17.691 --> 02:39:17.871]  I don't
[02:39:33.655 --> 02:39:35.477]  And before we play, that's what I was saying earlier.
[02:39:35.477 --> 02:39:36.918]  They think we're domesticated.
[02:39:36.918 --> 02:39:45.967]  They've done the math and know that 90% of people, you know, aren't self-sufficient and are dependent one way or the other on the government, even if they don't work for the government.
[02:39:45.967 --> 02:39:49.531]  And so they've decided to bankrupt everything to say, now here's your choice.
[02:39:49.531 --> 02:39:50.852]  Fully submit to us.
[02:39:50.852 --> 02:39:52.353]  And we know what that means.
[02:39:52.353 --> 02:39:53.855]  So tell us about this clip we're about to see.
[02:39:54.335 --> 02:39:59.339]  Well, it's a G20 clip when Obama was there and remember he was encouraging other nations.
[02:39:59.339 --> 02:40:02.922]  He was encouraging other nations to keep up the stimulus, right?
[02:40:02.922 --> 02:40:04.944]  That means get more in debt to the bankers.
[02:40:04.944 --> 02:40:06.005]  But then he went further.
[02:40:06.005 --> 02:40:09.467]  He also said in a clip that no nation be above any other.
[02:40:09.467 --> 02:40:12.070]  But that means lowering everyone with the bankers above us.
[02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:13.231]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:40:13.231 --> 02:40:13.471]  There we go.
[02:40:14.581 --> 02:40:24.930]  You know, one of the interesting things that's happened over the last 18 months as president is for some reason people keep on being surprised when I do what I said I was going to do.
[02:40:27.310 --> 02:40:50.525]  So I say I'm gonna reform our healthcare system and people think well gosh that's not smart politics maybe we should hold off or I say we're going to move forward on don't ask don't tell and somehow people say you know well why are you doing that you know I'm not sure that's good politics I'm doing it because I said I was going to do it and I think it's the right thing to do
[02:40:52.302 --> 02:41:10.192]  And people should learn that lesson about me because next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country, I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt step up.
[02:41:10.192 --> 02:41:12.353]  Because I'm calling their bluff.
[02:41:12.353 --> 02:41:17.676]  And we'll see how much of that
[02:41:19.264 --> 02:41:26.489]  How much of the political arguments they're making right now are real and how much of it was just... politics.
[02:41:26.489 --> 02:41:26.969]  Alright?
[02:41:26.969 --> 02:41:27.750]  Thank you very much everybody.
[02:41:28.624 --> 02:41:30.525]  Boy, your take on that.
[02:41:30.525 --> 02:41:36.550]  Well, the headline on that on YouTube was Obama cryptically presents very difficult choices to the country next year.
[02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:38.531]  Well, that's when he first got elected.
[02:41:38.531 --> 02:41:41.133]  That's what Biden said.
[02:41:41.133 --> 02:41:43.554]  He said he's going to do some things that are going to make people hate us.
[02:41:43.554 --> 02:41:45.676]  And what they do is all the taxes are going to go to debt.
[02:41:45.676 --> 02:41:47.737]  They're going to get rid of the police, the welfare.
[02:41:47.737 --> 02:41:48.658]  They're going to slash it all.
[02:41:48.658 --> 02:41:50.179]  They're going to take pensions.
[02:41:50.179 --> 02:41:51.640]  And that's going to be the tough choice.
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:55.523]  And we see Republicans in The Washington Times saying, yes, we need to raise the retirement age to 70.
[02:41:56.383 --> 02:41:58.565]  And we need to start taking part of people's pension funds.
[02:41:58.565 --> 02:42:01.147]  So, the bankers are going to get everything.
[02:42:01.147 --> 02:42:03.228]  They're going to have record profits like they've had the last two years.
[02:42:03.228 --> 02:42:03.969]  We're going to have nothing.
[02:42:04.557 --> 02:42:07.440]  Well, and we gotta remember, he was addressing the G20 audience.
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:10.403]  People that, uh, they're basically in the know what's going on.
[02:42:10.403 --> 02:42:19.271]  So, what I think he's anticipating is, I think he's anticipating that, uh, in this general election in November, we're gonna see a lot of incumbents get tossed out.
[02:42:19.271 --> 02:42:25.377]  Uh, probably, uh, for almost certain that we're gonna get a Republican majority in the House, maybe in the Senate as well.
[02:42:25.377 --> 02:42:27.779]  Eleven Senators are gone already from attrition.
[02:42:27.779 --> 02:42:29.581]  Either they've died or retired or whatever.
[02:42:29.981 --> 02:42:31.621]  We've got 40 U.S.
[02:42:31.621 --> 02:42:37.463]  House members that are gone already because they have stepped out of the fire here.
[02:42:37.463 --> 02:42:43.264]  So we've got a chance of seeing 20-30% new faces, potentially, in these upcoming weeks.
[02:42:43.264 --> 02:42:49.225]  And most of these faces we know are bonafide patriots, and so the globalists are going to have trouble getting them under control.
[02:42:49.225 --> 02:42:51.946]  And it's exponential.
[02:42:51.946 --> 02:42:53.126]  Either way you slice it.
[02:42:53.126 --> 02:42:53.886]  I mean, did you hear me?
[02:42:54.486 --> 02:43:00.329]  Read from the Financial Times of London, top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[02:43:00.329 --> 02:43:03.971]  I mean, this story alone, five years ago, we talk about this for a month straight.
[02:43:03.971 --> 02:43:06.152]  These things are coming out on an hourly basis.
[02:43:06.152 --> 02:43:10.054]  Right, it's crazy how fast things are happening and how fast things are coming out.
[02:43:10.054 --> 02:43:15.357]  It's that quote that you say all the time, that sometimes things happen in a year that happen in a hundred years that rapidly.
[02:43:15.357 --> 02:43:21.660]  But I think they're anticipating this big change in the House and Senate, and so Obama is going to set the new
[02:43:22.409 --> 02:43:36.017]  Freshman up for a fall they're gonna come in and want to see fiscal responsibility implemented even though as we've your caller stated earlier In the last few days that the New World Order has Aladdin's lamp when it comes to creating money.
[02:43:36.017 --> 02:43:46.623]  Well the there's going to be a desire for fiscal responsibility by the new freshman coming in and so he may let that happen to a more hideous degree than even they want and
[02:43:47.043 --> 02:43:49.026]  And then he's got somebody to point the finger at.
[02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:05.342]  You're allowed to administer poison to someone.
[02:44:05.342 --> 02:44:07.265]  We will not respond if someone's poisoned.
[02:44:07.265 --> 02:44:10.748]  Extortion, burglary, theft, embezzlement, grand theft.
[02:44:10.748 --> 02:44:12.951]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:44:12.951 --> 02:44:15.293]  Sabotaging power lines.
[02:44:15.293 --> 02:44:17.255]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:44:17.255 --> 02:44:20.799]  And we'll put that list on screen if you scroll down on that NBC article.
[02:44:20.799 --> 02:44:21.900]  This is his list.
[02:44:22.621 --> 02:44:23.022]  Yeah.
[02:44:39.238 --> 02:44:47.001]  And they're going to offer the new SDR and say, we'll jack the dollar up for you for a while, because under this SDR, the globals will fully run the dollar offshore now.
[02:44:47.001 --> 02:44:49.042]  It'll still be there, it's just they control it.
[02:44:49.042 --> 02:44:54.384]  And then now you'll have this SDR, a digital currency above that, and that's going to be their answer.
[02:44:54.384 --> 02:44:55.965]  Global government will fix this.
[02:44:55.965 --> 02:44:58.906]  And if we capitulate and roll over, they'll turn the economy back on for a few years.
[02:44:59.628 --> 02:45:01.830]  Well, but you know, we're going to have to go through this.
[02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:09.016]  That's what we've got to figure out, is how to transition from this funny money Federal Reserve system to a real constitutional money system.
[02:45:09.016 --> 02:45:10.077]  Well, that's what they covered.
[02:45:10.077 --> 02:45:14.360]  That's a very ugly path, unfortunately, potentially, but that's the route we need to go.
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:19.365]  Now, I want to get into toll roads, but first some more, and we'll keep you five minutes to the next hour if we need to.
[02:45:19.365 --> 02:45:20.906]  Richard, I know you have key info on the toll roads.
[02:45:20.906 --> 02:45:22.988]  That's why I wanted to get you here, why I called you.
[02:45:22.988 --> 02:45:24.449]  But I want to go back to this.
[02:45:24.449 --> 02:45:25.370]  You read the IMF 100
[02:45:26.090 --> 02:45:26.370]  I don't know.
[02:45:44.522 --> 02:45:44.762]  They just
[02:46:05.191 --> 02:46:09.653]  A hundred miles down the road, we pushed back 50, but still they've got 50 miles on us.
[02:46:09.653 --> 02:46:22.678]  So they know they have to make it super bad, so that then we fight back, get a little bit back, and think we won, when really our standard of living's been dropped by 20, 30, 40, 50 percent, which Maury Strong and the UN and Al Gore say is their goal.
[02:46:22.678 --> 02:46:26.240]  The carbon tax is to destroy our industrial society, to make us dependent.
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:27.680]  China, India and others are exempt.
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:29.321]  They're the new globalist command base.
[02:46:29.981 --> 02:46:39.744]  And so, they're going to wreck things so bad, so that, artificially, so that then when they turn things back on, it'll be a lot worse than it is now, but we'll think, oh my God, at least I've got food.
[02:46:39.744 --> 02:46:40.924]  At least the power's on.
[02:46:40.924 --> 02:46:42.265]  At least the water's flowing.
[02:46:42.265 --> 02:46:46.046]  And in the IMF World Bank plans, they say how they do it.
[02:46:46.046 --> 02:46:47.506]  I mean, they're doing that here.
[02:46:47.506 --> 02:46:49.227]  This is going to happen.
[02:46:49.227 --> 02:46:50.247]  And Richard, how do we stop it?
[02:46:50.487 --> 02:46:51.688]  I know they're engineering it.
[02:46:51.688 --> 02:46:52.888]  I know they're executing it.
[02:46:52.888 --> 02:46:53.629]  I have their playbook.
[02:46:53.629 --> 02:46:57.290]  I mean, it's not like I'm... I just realized now, they're really going for everything.
[02:46:57.290 --> 02:46:59.571]  They are going to hammer us into nothing.
[02:46:59.571 --> 02:47:01.973]  And I just want people to understand this.
[02:47:01.973 --> 02:47:08.015]  Well, one way to stop it, you did the plug earlier, is get those videos in the hands of as many people as possible.
[02:47:08.015 --> 02:47:11.057]  But the other things we can do is, we've still got elections coming up, primaries.
[02:47:11.057 --> 02:47:13.298]  Unfortunately, the Texas primaries already passed.
[02:47:13.298 --> 02:47:16.419]  We don't get another shot at firing incumbents until November.
[02:47:16.419 --> 02:47:17.340]  But in Oklahoma,
[02:47:17.950 --> 02:47:27.532]  In Oklahoma, we've got Randy Brogdon that has a good chance to run, to get into the Governor's primary in the Republican Party.
[02:47:27.532 --> 02:47:28.332]  Randy Brogdon.
[02:47:28.332 --> 02:47:30.653]  His website, RandyBrogdon.com.
[02:47:30.653 --> 02:47:39.215]  He might be worthy of an interview, I think, because he's a really good guy and he's polling around 40% in some of these mainstream monkey polls.
[02:47:39.215 --> 02:47:46.777]  So, he's looking really good there and plus, that creates a definite roadblock for the NAFTA corridor, for the trans-Texas corridor.
[02:47:47.737 --> 02:48:02.428]  Now there's 83 of these mega highways they want, but the key, and they admit for the whole country to merge into, is the Trans-Texas I-35 mega corridor, all the way into the north of Canada, all the way down to the port on the Pacific side in southern Mexico.
[02:48:02.748 --> 02:48:03.108]  Right.
[02:48:03.108 --> 02:48:07.652]  Laredo, Texas is the largest inland port in the United States.
[02:48:07.652 --> 02:48:08.453]  Laredo, Texas.
[02:48:08.453 --> 02:48:10.475]  Largest inland port, so absolutely.
[02:48:10.475 --> 02:48:16.720]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is a cornerstone, keystone piece of the NAFTA Corridor.
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:17.601]  It's their Death Star.
[02:48:17.601 --> 02:48:19.082]  We blow that politically.
[02:48:19.082 --> 02:48:21.985]  They're still going to have Star Destroyers, but we've blown their main fleet.
[02:48:22.225 --> 02:48:27.987]  Well, in November, we're going to get a chance to fire every incumbent in Texas that we possibly can.
[02:48:27.987 --> 02:48:32.869]  That's our best hope to make changes here politically in Texas up in November.
[02:48:32.869 --> 02:48:36.331]  And then up in Oklahoma, we've got Randy Brogdon, like I said.
[02:48:36.331 --> 02:48:37.071]  We've got R.J.
[02:48:37.071 --> 02:48:39.312]  Harris, another candidate for U.S.
[02:48:39.312 --> 02:48:41.453]  Rep that's got a good chance up there.
[02:48:41.453 --> 02:48:45.514]  And then we've got James Lane, Lane for OKSenate.com.
[02:48:45.514 --> 02:48:47.255]  James Lane is running for Oklahoma Senate.
[02:48:47.415 --> 02:48:48.655]  There are hundreds of Patriot candidates.
[02:48:48.655 --> 02:48:51.816]  People should find them in their areas and break their backs supporting them.
[02:48:51.816 --> 02:48:59.879]  Now let's tell people what the NAFTA highways do, and then a microcosm example, seizing MOPAC, which is admittedly illegal to put a toll road on an existing road.
[02:48:59.879 --> 02:49:04.040]  Every time they try it, we fight back, they retract it, they're back.
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:05.501]  Let's use MOPAC as a microcosm.
[02:49:06.081 --> 02:49:16.626]  Well, with MOPAC, see, the engineers that originally designed and built that figured that a lot more of that traffic on MOPAC would just be having downtown Austin as their destination.
[02:49:16.626 --> 02:49:25.511]  But as you well know, with I-35 being congested so badly so many hours of the day, then MOPAC has become a big through route through Austin now.
[02:49:25.511 --> 02:49:31.034]  And what they've done, though, is when they engineered that Lady Bird Lake Bridge, used to be Town Lake Bridge,
[02:49:31.727 --> 02:49:35.989]  When they engineered that, there's a lane that drops off on southbound and northbound side.
[02:49:35.989 --> 02:49:38.950]  So there's a little bit of good news in this.
[02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:44.152]  The good news is they're going to add a third through lane, both north and southbound on that bridge.
[02:49:44.152 --> 02:49:47.173]  I did call Kirk Watson's office last week after I heard you mention it.
[02:49:47.173 --> 02:49:48.733]  I can't believe a word he says though.
[02:49:48.733 --> 02:49:50.014]  Well, I got this from Sandy.
[02:49:50.014 --> 02:49:50.734]  So we'll see.
[02:49:50.734 --> 02:49:52.155]  Hopefully they live up to it.
[02:49:52.155 --> 02:49:54.836]  And as I understand, they're already working and re-striping.
[02:49:54.836 --> 02:49:56.096]  Well, it should be a free road.
[02:49:56.096 --> 02:49:57.077]  We've already paid for it.
[02:49:57.077 --> 02:49:58.837]  It should be completely free road, three lanes.
[02:49:58.837 --> 02:50:00.858]  I mean, Kirk Watson is as crooked as a barrel of snakes.
[02:50:01.098 --> 02:50:03.459]  I tell you, I've got problems with Kirk Watson myself.
[02:50:03.459 --> 02:50:09.443]  But three lanes each way, all the way through, is what it's supposed to be when they get through re-striping.
[02:50:09.443 --> 02:50:14.325]  Now what they are planning on still doing is that fourth additional lane called the managed lane.
[02:50:14.325 --> 02:50:18.548]  That's going to be a toll road lane, and potentially that'll help MOPAC marginally, but
[02:50:19.148 --> 02:50:25.771]  It'll create a bureaucracy that will continue to fight to keep I-35 in gridlock.
[02:50:25.771 --> 02:50:29.273]  I mean, here we are, we've got SH-130 that runs to our east.
[02:50:29.273 --> 02:50:31.654]  That's supposed to be our bypass here in Austin.
[02:50:31.654 --> 02:50:33.335]  Very underutilized.
[02:50:33.335 --> 02:50:35.736]  Millions of Austinite taxpayer dollars.
[02:50:35.736 --> 02:50:37.437]  The point is they hold us hostage.
[02:50:37.437 --> 02:50:41.979]  They won't build the roads, and then they want to give it to foreign companies to loot us.
[02:50:41.979 --> 02:50:43.040]  And the way I've read the law,
[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:46.403]  Is it illegal to put toll roads on existing roads?
[02:50:46.403 --> 02:50:48.045]  Well, it is, but they parse those words.
[02:50:48.045 --> 02:50:50.327]  They'll say, well, we're going to add these new lanes.
[02:50:50.327 --> 02:50:52.890]  And so the existing road was the lanes that you had.
[02:50:52.890 --> 02:50:54.751]  And how are you going to exit off those?
[02:50:54.751 --> 02:50:56.573]  Well, that's, I've yet to see exactly.
[02:50:56.573 --> 02:50:57.614]  It's impossible.
[02:50:57.614 --> 02:50:58.475]  It's impossible.
[02:50:58.475 --> 02:50:59.556]  The engineers have said so.
[02:51:00.217 --> 02:51:03.579]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:51:03.579 --> 02:51:07.502]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:51:07.502 --> 02:51:11.225]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:51:11.225 --> 02:51:16.148]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[02:51:16.368 --> 02:51:20.213]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[02:51:20.213 --> 02:51:26.381]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[02:52:02.285 --> 02:52:04.466]  You're subject to public police action.
[02:52:04.466 --> 02:52:05.727]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:05.727 --> 02:52:09.588]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:09.588 --> 02:52:11.889]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:11.889 --> 02:52:17.752]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:17.752 --> 02:52:23.995]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:24.415 --> 02:52:30.399]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:30.399 --> 02:52:34.582]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:34.582 --> 02:52:38.864]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:38.864 --> 02:52:44.808]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:44.808 --> 02:52:48.370]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:48.370 --> 02:52:50.351]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:50.351 --> 02:52:50.792]  It's here.

[02:53:12.989 --> 02:53:14.930]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:53:14.930 --> 02:53:16.911]  And not the cause of sinus problems.

[02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:50.270]  It works!
[02:54:13.409 --> 02:54:17.752]  Alright, we got Richard for a few more segments, and Larry Pratt's coming on for about 30.
[02:54:17.752 --> 02:54:27.758]  We'll take a few final calls towards the end of the next hour and get into some other news I haven't covered yet, but the establishment is going to promote lawlessness and the collapse to bring in their control.
[02:54:27.758 --> 02:54:35.063]  Getting back to toll roads, they always claim they're not going to put them in when resistance mounts, and then they come back later and do put them in.
[02:54:35.063 --> 02:54:38.385]  They've claimed over and over again no toll roads for MOPAC 183.
[02:54:38.385 --> 02:54:40.527]  It's the same story where there's Indiana, New Jersey,
[02:54:41.267 --> 02:54:46.448]  Over and over again, and we know that these are sweetheart deals with these foreign companies.
[02:54:46.448 --> 02:54:49.369]  I mean, this is not privatization, this is looting.
[02:54:49.369 --> 02:54:55.610]  But from your deep research on toll roads, I mean, look at how a year and a half ago they announced, okay, no trans-Texas corridor, we're going to cancel it.
[02:54:55.610 --> 02:55:01.192]  Then the same article in the AP said, we're just going to do it project by project and not call it that now.
[02:55:01.192 --> 02:55:06.613]  So they play these semantical games so we don't have a united front of enemies to go after.
[02:55:07.293 --> 02:55:15.878]  Well, Alex, you know, we really have slowed them down and we've damaged them, but they are definitely not gone and they've got that Aladdin's Lamp of money that they want to keep pouring into this.
[02:55:15.878 --> 02:55:18.559]  The road builders are chomping at the bit for that money.
[02:55:18.559 --> 02:55:22.682]  So, they are going to continue, like you said, wanting to build these toll roads.
[02:55:22.682 --> 02:55:24.083]  They want to milk the U.S.
[02:55:24.083 --> 02:55:29.766]  people out of all the money they can get, and the ones that they can't milk on being on the toll roads, they're just going to put them on foot.
[02:55:30.306 --> 02:55:32.267]  That's part of their plan to reduce congestion.
[02:55:32.267 --> 02:55:40.352]  For the first time, we knew it was the policy in the last 20 years, but the head of the Department of Transportation said in the New York Times, what, a few months ago, that they're anti-car.
[02:55:40.352 --> 02:55:42.073]  But America's designed for cars.
[02:55:42.073 --> 02:55:44.275]  We're not compact Europe or Tokyo.
[02:55:44.275 --> 02:55:48.817]  I think Chicago and New York are probably the only cities that you can really get by without a car.
[02:55:48.817 --> 02:55:49.758]  Well, they know that, though.
[02:55:49.758 --> 02:55:52.219]  This is about bankrupting everybody.
[02:55:52.219 --> 02:55:52.660]  It is.
[02:55:52.660 --> 02:55:55.802]  I mean, the Pentagon designed the roads we've got in the 50s.
[02:55:55.802 --> 02:55:57.823]  They make us all dependent on it, then they try to take it away.
[02:55:58.303 --> 02:56:05.469]  Well, I've been in the transportation business over 30 years now and I'm seeing more and more people be priced out of their cars, literally.
[02:56:05.469 --> 02:56:08.871]  When we had the price hike of $4 a gallon gas there briefly back in 2008.
[02:56:10.382 --> 02:56:15.306]  People were literally bailing out of their cars and riding taxis and buses because they could not afford the gas.
[02:56:15.306 --> 02:56:20.130]  So even as expensive as a taxi was, they were preferring that over driving their own vehicle.
[02:56:20.130 --> 02:56:25.594]  So they've definitely got these plans to put people back on their feet.
[02:56:25.594 --> 02:56:34.541]  As a matter of fact, one guy jokingly said during a Central Texas meeting two or three years ago, he said that, I'd like to see tolls on trails.
[02:56:35.399 --> 02:56:38.363]  You know, put tolls on trails and make people pay for walking.
[02:56:38.363 --> 02:56:43.510]  So that's the full intention that they have at some point if they can get... Well, I mean, we always joke, what's the new tax?
[02:56:43.510 --> 02:56:44.551]  A tax on air?
[02:56:44.551 --> 02:56:47.615]  That's the New York Times headline, a tax on air.
[02:56:47.615 --> 02:56:48.576]  That's carbon dioxide.
[02:56:48.576 --> 02:56:49.377]  That's what Bill Gates said.
[02:56:49.377 --> 02:56:50.639]  We're going to tax you for breathing.
[02:56:51.468 --> 02:56:59.531]  Which, by the way, fellow Texans, on TexasTurf.org, Terri Hall's website, that she's always breaking down the toll road issues, got stories on there.
[02:56:59.531 --> 02:57:06.073]  There's a story on there right now how that highway lobby wants every kind of tax possible to build roads with.
[02:57:06.073 --> 02:57:14.916]  Now, they want toll roads, they want additional gasoline taxes, they want sales tax money, they want to dip into property tax money, they want to dip into every possible
[02:57:15.416 --> 02:57:16.798]  We're good to go.
[02:57:31.653 --> 02:57:34.474]  Price tag, but basically you're right.
[02:57:34.474 --> 02:57:41.456]  Even in down times, we still get more people, still driving more cars, covering more miles, collecting more gasoline taxes.
[02:57:41.456 --> 02:57:47.458]  The state of Texas sends billions of dollars every year, and over the past decades, multi-billions of dollars.
[02:57:47.458 --> 02:57:55.300]  Well the point is, in Europe they've admitted this, and IBM's promoting this, we're going to be taxed on all roads off your license plate with license plate readers.
[02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:57.782]  I'd tell people this five years ago, they'd laugh at me.
[02:57:57.782 --> 02:58:01.485]  Now, you go on most of the toll roads in Europe and the U.S., there's no toll booth.
[02:58:01.485 --> 02:58:05.448]  They just charge you off your license plate.
[02:58:05.448 --> 02:58:11.153]  They've already got a test in Texas going where people get a transponder in their car that tracks them and taxes them.
[02:58:11.153 --> 02:58:16.277]  Your cars are going to be turned into basically... A taxi cab.
[02:58:16.277 --> 02:58:17.778]  A taxi cab.
[02:58:17.778 --> 02:58:21.501]  And notice, your taxes go up, but they say, we've got to get rid of cops, they can't respond to burglary.
[02:58:21.761 --> 02:58:30.709]  Well, and the best example to look at is just type into search engine and look at Singapore roads and study Singapore toll roads and Singapore tolls.
[02:58:30.709 --> 02:58:35.032]  They've got 100% tax on just importing a car, if I remember right.
[02:58:35.032 --> 02:58:35.673]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:58:35.673 --> 02:58:37.394]  I mean, it's all a rip-off to the elites.
[02:58:37.394 --> 02:58:38.135]  They're robbing you.
[02:58:38.135 --> 02:58:38.675]  It's serfdom.
[02:58:38.675 --> 02:58:45.021]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:49.810 --> 02:58:54.794]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:58:54.794 --> 02:58:55.774]  What have we got?
[02:58:55.774 --> 02:58:58.216]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:58:58.216 --> 02:58:59.237]  A republic.
[02:58:59.237 --> 02:59:01.879]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:59:01.879 --> 02:59:04.141]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:59:04.141 --> 02:59:06.182]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:59:06.182 --> 02:59:07.843]  So they think they own our land?
[02:59:07.843 --> 02:59:09.164]  They think they own our water?
[02:59:09.164 --> 02:59:09.785]  Children?
[02:59:09.785 --> 02:59:10.906]  Our education?
[02:59:10.906 --> 02:59:11.726]  Our money?
[02:59:11.726 --> 02:59:15.389]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:59:15.749 --> 02:59:20.714]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:59:20.714 --> 02:59:21.735]  We have the facts.
[02:59:21.735 --> 02:59:22.896]  We have the Constitution.
[02:59:22.896 --> 02:59:23.797]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:59:23.797 --> 02:59:24.698]  We have common law.
[02:59:24.698 --> 02:59:27.220]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:27.220 --> 02:59:31.004]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:59:31.104 --> 02:59:36.045]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:59:36.045 --> 02:59:37.545]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:59:37.545 --> 02:59:38.626]  Don't tread on me.
[02:59:38.626 --> 02:59:50.528]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:59:50.528 --> 02:59:54.109]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.109 --> 02:59:57.330]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.298 --> 03:00:09.142]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:09.142 --> 03:00:10.724]  You want answers?
[03:00:10.724 --> 03:00:11.645]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:11.645 --> 03:00:16.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:20.533]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.932 --> 03:00:25.657]  Richard Reeves, talk show host, great political activist from here in Austin, Texas.
[03:00:25.657 --> 03:00:27.920]  Got five more minutes with him and Larry Pratt's coming up to about 30.
[03:00:27.920 --> 03:00:29.182]  Then I'll jam in some phone calls.
[03:00:29.182 --> 03:00:30.804]  Phones aren't open yet though, folks.
[03:00:30.804 --> 03:00:32.286]  I'm gonna recap the top stories.
[03:00:32.286 --> 03:00:33.888]  I mean, I laid it out at the start of the broadcast.
[03:00:33.888 --> 03:00:36.592]  This is the most important time in our history that we're facing.
[03:00:36.852 --> 03:00:43.801]  And there's no doubt they're going to slam us into a total depression to try to break our will and basically domesticate us.
[03:00:43.801 --> 03:00:45.844]  And that's just the beginning of their endgame.
[03:00:45.844 --> 03:00:53.375]  But Richard, in the last five minutes we've got left, recap and go more into how you see them breaking our will with the things they're doing right now.
[03:00:55.700 --> 03:00:58.522]  Keep on raising our taxes any way possible.
[03:00:58.522 --> 03:01:06.008]  That's a big way they do it, and of course the media has been doing their job, and you've covered it so well about LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan and all this.
[03:01:06.008 --> 03:01:12.653]  So they just continue with their dumbing down at the education level and the public indoctrination centers, etc.
[03:01:12.653 --> 03:01:20.659]  I see them firing on all their weapons, pretty much, except, you know, hopefully not military weapons here, but you've got these environmental disasters.
[03:01:21.767 --> 03:01:24.990]  The question is now, at what point will they stop?
[03:01:24.990 --> 03:01:26.752]  At what point will they back off?
[03:01:26.752 --> 03:01:35.521]  And that's where we've got no choice but to go in as some of those analogies you've made in the past where like we're flying with X-Wing fighters into the Death Star.
[03:01:35.521 --> 03:01:40.787]  We've got to go in and we've got to fight them at every level that we can, politically, info warrior.
[03:01:40.787 --> 03:01:43.349]  Every little thing people do is so important because
[03:01:44.610 --> 03:01:45.331]  People get confused.
[03:01:45.331 --> 03:01:47.232]  They think, well, this is all about Obama getting re-elected.
[03:01:47.232 --> 03:01:48.852]  They could care less about him.
[03:01:48.852 --> 03:01:51.574]  He's not the power structure.
[03:01:51.574 --> 03:01:53.395]  And so they're more than happy to see him destroyed.
[03:01:53.395 --> 03:01:54.495]  They'll just move forward.
[03:01:54.495 --> 03:01:58.077]  We must put the blame on the criminal elite, the ruling class.
[03:01:58.077 --> 03:01:59.158]  Right, the ruling class.
[03:01:59.158 --> 03:02:00.758]  And how do we get to them?
[03:02:00.758 --> 03:02:01.539]  That's a good question.
[03:02:01.539 --> 03:02:06.521]  You've talked about trying to have indictments and have jury trials, etc.
[03:02:06.521 --> 03:02:08.362]  And that's definitely a way we need to go.
[03:02:08.362 --> 03:02:12.284]  But we need to have some political clout up there to initiate this.
[03:02:12.284 --> 03:02:13.105]  We've got to have judges.
[03:02:13.985 --> 03:02:17.366]  Well, when we have, exactly, it's like we're on a high wire act is exactly right.
[03:02:17.366 --> 03:02:19.366]  We've got 500 feet up and no net.
[03:02:36.631 --> 03:02:47.999]  That's what we're going into so that's why we need every tightrope walker we can get and we especially need Alex Jones slash Ron Paul types in political office at every level from dog catcher to senator to governor.
[03:02:47.999 --> 03:02:54.444]  So our people are everywhere not even as a majority yet but to watch and to expose corruption.
[03:02:54.444 --> 03:02:57.066]  Everything you do is life and death now at this point.
[03:02:57.066 --> 03:03:03.511]  It is and I tell you I'm thinking that we're swinging 10 to 20 percent of the vote if we were organized enough to at least
[03:03:04.171 --> 03:03:04.872]  We're good to go.
[03:03:25.247 --> 03:03:39.939]  Richard, I'm going to make this final point and then have you close out your statement, and I appreciate you being here, that I had always seen it in the last four years as really scary that the elite were all moving out of the U.S., and they're even leaving Israel, and even leaving England, and moving to offshore armored islands.
[03:03:39.939 --> 03:03:50.968]  I kind of saw it as a negative, like they were going to destroy us, which they are, but that's kind of good, because it looks like they're just trying to steal everything, and now they may realize they're going to finally get kicked out.
[03:03:51.977 --> 03:03:55.960]  Well, it's looking like they're going to have to self-eject because they may not have any choice.
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:04:02.445]  And like you said, many of them over the years, you've said that many of them have already gotten their place in the Cayman Islands or wherever they go to.
[03:04:02.445 --> 03:04:04.567]  But the New World Order is definitely
[03:04:05.473 --> 03:04:06.514]  It's global.
[03:04:06.514 --> 03:04:07.034]  It's global.
[03:04:07.034 --> 03:04:08.316]  So I don't know where they're going to go.
[03:04:08.316 --> 03:04:10.437]  I don't know where anybody's going to go because I've looked at it.
[03:04:10.437 --> 03:04:13.140]  I've looked at going to Central America and other countries.
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:18.044]  Well, in their new world order system, it's like a spider tying up its prey.
[03:04:18.044 --> 03:04:19.485]  We are tied up in the red tape.
[03:04:19.485 --> 03:04:20.946]  They're all exempt from it.
[03:04:20.946 --> 03:04:26.952]  So that's why they only care about that global police power so they can rob nations one by one and kind of hopscotch around.
[03:04:27.492 --> 03:04:32.256]  Well, but these guys that only have the multi-millions or maybe in the low billions, they're just not big enough.
[03:04:32.256 --> 03:04:36.699]  So they're gonna end up being the victim of the spider in the web as well at some point.
[03:04:36.699 --> 03:04:41.563]  So they might as well join the fight and help fund what's going on here in the United States.
[03:04:41.563 --> 03:04:47.087]  The United States is definitely worth saving and I'm not leaving anytime soon, that's for sure.
[03:04:47.267 --> 03:04:48.709]  No, we've got to stand here.
[03:04:48.709 --> 03:04:49.569]  We've got to make our stand.
[03:04:49.569 --> 03:04:50.851]  There's nowhere to run.
[03:04:50.851 --> 03:04:52.392]  Richard Reeves, always great having you in.
[03:04:52.392 --> 03:04:53.033]  Thanks a lot.
[03:04:53.033 --> 03:04:53.754]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[03:04:53.754 --> 03:04:54.494]  I appreciate it.
[03:04:54.494 --> 03:04:58.979]  And we need some more leadership on the toll road fight, so come join in and get on.
[03:04:58.979 --> 03:04:59.520]  God bless you.
[03:05:00.228 --> 03:05:04.131]  I'm concerned about food for my family in the event of an emergency.
[03:05:04.131 --> 03:05:06.072]  And I know you are too.
[03:05:06.072 --> 03:05:07.133]  Are you ready?
[03:05:07.133 --> 03:05:09.074]  Don't wait for an emergency to happen.

[03:05:53.727 --> 03:05:54.467]  Wholesale Pricing.
[03:06:00.270 --> 03:06:05.234]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:06:05.234 --> 03:06:06.234]  What have we got?
[03:06:06.234 --> 03:06:08.676]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:06:08.676 --> 03:06:09.677]  A republic.
[03:06:09.677 --> 03:06:12.339]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:06:12.339 --> 03:06:14.601]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:06:14.601 --> 03:06:16.622]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:06:16.622 --> 03:06:18.303]  So they think they own our land?
[03:06:18.303 --> 03:06:19.624]  They think they own our water?
[03:06:19.624 --> 03:06:20.245]  Children?
[03:06:20.245 --> 03:06:21.366]  Our education?
[03:06:21.366 --> 03:06:22.186]  Our money?
[03:06:22.186 --> 03:06:25.829]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:06:26.189 --> 03:06:29.894]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:06:29.894 --> 03:06:31.156]  You are being warned!
[03:06:31.156 --> 03:06:32.197]  We have the facts.
[03:06:32.197 --> 03:06:33.359]  We have the Constitution.
[03:06:33.359 --> 03:06:34.260]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:35.161]  We have common law.
[03:06:35.161 --> 03:06:37.685]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:37.685 --> 03:06:40.629]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[03:06:40.629 --> 03:06:41.450]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:46.516]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:06:46.516 --> 03:06:48.018]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:06:48.018 --> 03:06:49.099]  Don't tread on me.
[03:06:49.099 --> 03:06:55.967]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:07:02.335 --> 03:07:03.556]  This is not a drill.
[03:07:03.556 --> 03:07:06.058]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:07:06.058 --> 03:07:07.959]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[03:07:07.959 --> 03:07:15.184]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[03:07:15.184 --> 03:07:19.567]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[03:07:19.567 --> 03:07:29.895]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[03:07:30.575 --> 03:07:30.935]  I think so.
[03:08:04.793 --> 03:08:09.617]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:09.617 --> 03:08:11.219]  You want answers?
[03:08:11.219 --> 03:08:12.780]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:12.780 --> 03:08:16.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.964 --> 03:08:21.028]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:22.631 --> 03:08:31.280]  Well, the head of the only serious national organization that is no compromise on the Second Amendment, Larry Pratt, is with us until about 45 after.
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:35.164]  Then I'll jam in some phone calls and get into some of our top stories.
[03:08:35.164 --> 03:08:40.589]  But I wanted to talk about the Second Amendment situation with Larry Pratt from gunowners.org.
[03:08:40.589 --> 03:08:43.151]  But first, I wanted to throw this out there.
[03:08:43.932 --> 03:09:07.703]  Headlines suffer these criminals in Oakland don't call the cops and the police chief said Give us more funding and we won't respond to burglary theft embezzlement grand theft grand theft auto extortion embezzlement by an employee Poisoning administering poison to someone vandalism and it also says Sabotaging power lines.
[03:09:07.703 --> 03:09:08.364]  I mean, I don't know
[03:09:09.364 --> 03:09:15.789]  If this was an alternate dimension or something, but that dovetails with a WKYC report and others we've been talking about.
[03:09:15.789 --> 03:09:19.973]  We're 112 deputies to 49 deputies in this Ohio County.
[03:09:19.973 --> 03:09:25.597]  But that deputy, that sheriff and judge, they're saying, buy guns, we can't protect you.
[03:09:25.597 --> 03:09:29.521]  And the 49 cops they're going to keep, one will be out there helping with calls.
[03:09:29.521 --> 03:09:31.682]  The rest are all bureaucracy and revenue generation.
[03:09:32.523 --> 03:09:38.286]  But out in Oakland, they're increasing anti-gun funding, wanting thumbprints to get ammo.
[03:09:38.286 --> 03:09:39.667]  It's just totally insane.
[03:09:39.667 --> 03:09:50.394]  But then we see Obama telling Senator Kyle a month ago in a meeting, and this is on record, that, as Senator Kyle has spoken about it, that I'm going to keep the borders open for a crisis, as the SPP documents say, to get amnesty.
[03:09:50.394 --> 03:09:52.435]  So this is an act of treason.
[03:09:52.435 --> 03:09:54.856]  I had Arizona Sheriff on.
[03:09:56.557 --> 03:09:56.797]  I don't
[03:10:17.608 --> 03:10:19.489]  So I see this as a Supreme Court ruling.
[03:10:19.489 --> 03:10:21.190]  You've got a right to basically turn your guns in.
[03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:25.792]  But some say it has at least some effect because it says you can't outright ban them all.
[03:10:25.792 --> 03:10:28.613]  So we'll talk about all that with Larry Pratt.
[03:10:28.613 --> 03:10:31.534]  But now we have CNN saying central banks start to abandon U.S.
[03:10:31.534 --> 03:10:32.195]  dollar.
[03:10:32.195 --> 03:10:34.556]  New York Times saying we're in a mega depression.
[03:10:35.396 --> 03:10:38.538]  So now they're not lying about that, but their answer is more government.
[03:11:05.396 --> 03:11:11.540]  And short of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing, I think, I can't think of how he can do that.
[03:11:11.540 --> 03:11:12.640]  Amazing statement.
[03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:17.143]  So we're all in grave danger, ladies and gentlemen, right now.
[03:11:17.143 --> 03:11:18.564]  Larry Pratt, good to have you with us.
[03:11:18.564 --> 03:11:19.325]  And good to be with you.
[03:11:19.325 --> 03:11:20.265]  Thanks for having me.
[03:11:20.265 --> 03:11:22.486]  Let's take it piece by piece.
[03:11:22.486 --> 03:11:33.013]  What is your view on all over the country, police saying all the money has to go to bankers, we're bankrupt, and we're not going to protect you anymore, but you can't have a gun to protect yourself?
[03:11:33.493 --> 03:11:34.394]  Well, there's the rub.
[03:11:34.394 --> 03:11:38.696]  It's that can't have a gun anyway, even though we're not going to do our job.
[03:11:38.696 --> 03:11:45.141]  What it should be is a wake-up call for all of us that we can't depend on the police.
[03:11:45.141 --> 03:11:48.403]  Even if they're doing everything they possibly can and want to do,
[03:11:49.241 --> 03:11:55.485]  They're just not going to be enough of them ever to have a cop on your shoulder.
[03:11:55.485 --> 03:12:01.488]  You know, the bumper sticker says, uh, I carry a gun because a cop is too heavy.
[03:12:01.488 --> 03:12:03.730]  And that's, I think, what comes out of all this.
[03:12:03.730 --> 03:12:18.799]  And we've got to push back on our employees who have the incredible view that they can tell us we can't have a gun to protect ourselves and tell them that either they get it figured out right or we're going to get somebody else in there.
[03:12:20.720 --> 03:12:33.168]  But I mean, what about the message that we're not going to respond to burglary, home invasions, we're not going to respond to people being poisoned when someone poisons them, we're not going to respond to extortion, we're not going to respond to sabotage.
[03:12:33.168 --> 03:12:38.651]  I mean, this is a green light to go absolutely ape in Oakland, California.
[03:12:38.651 --> 03:12:42.674]  Well, you know, even in an anti-gun jurisdiction such as Chicago,
[03:12:43.534 --> 03:13:03.438]  Uh, it kind of surprised me, but the state several years ago, in fact Obama voted on the wrong side of the measure, the state has a law that preempts what cities can do when someone uses a quote-unquote illegal gun, meaning it wasn't licensed, but of course you couldn't get a license for it anyway, and they use it in self-defense during a home invasion.
[03:13:04.199 --> 03:13:10.926]  They, the cities, are prohibited from taking such an individual to court.
[03:13:10.926 --> 03:13:18.454]  And three times in the last couple of months, individuals have used handguns for self-defense.
[03:13:18.454 --> 03:13:21.617]  In at least one case I know they shot and killed the invader.
[03:13:22.484 --> 03:13:27.533]  Nothing could be done by the city as bad as Daley wanted to bring charges.
[03:13:27.533 --> 03:13:28.555]  Couldn't do it.
[03:13:28.555 --> 03:13:34.345]  And so that's one way to legislatively handle the problem is just make it so that you can't
[03:13:35.023 --> 03:13:58.307]  Touch us if we have done something in self-defense and of course the better laws are those in Florida and Texas and some other states The so-called castle doctrine where your home is your castle and they've taken the castle to mean anywhere you are So if you're out in a parking lot and some thug is trying to rape you and you pull out a piece and blow him away Well, that was just his bad luck
[03:13:58.627 --> 03:14:03.550]  And it shows the mindset, though, of what we'd call liberal or communist jurisdictions.
[03:14:03.550 --> 03:14:04.850]  Did you see the case last week?
[03:14:04.850 --> 03:14:12.214]  I know you've been on a town where the 82-year-old vet, the guy was robbing him, taking his trailer, trying to run over him, two illegal aliens.
[03:14:12.214 --> 03:14:25.320]  So he shot one of them, just wounding him, and then they let the illegals go, even though they pled guilty to stealing it, and they charged him with murder, not manslaughter, the old man with murder and life in prison because he defended himself.
[03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:27.061]  That sounds like something out of London.
[03:14:27.061 --> 03:14:27.722]  Yes, it does.
[03:14:28.903 --> 03:14:42.820]  I know that there's that temptation for some prosecutors even in a state like Texas where a situation a couple of years ago the facts were a little different but the thugs were running across from his neighbor's house across his
[03:14:43.470 --> 03:15:10.176]  Property and he blew him away and the whole they spent six months trying to figure out if they could Get a bill from a grand jury on that and they finally dropped the charges because the Texas law is so clear that You can use lethal force if you have any reason to think your life is in danger when you got a couple of thugs seeing you there with a shotgun cutting across your property and
[03:15:10.985 --> 03:15:11.366]  I don't
[03:15:27.365 --> 03:15:29.907]  Great cost and injustice, frankly.
[03:15:29.907 --> 03:15:32.189]  Justice delayed is justice denied.
[03:15:32.189 --> 03:15:36.392]  Well, Larry, we know in Chicago and New York City, they have the highest crime rates.
[03:15:36.392 --> 03:15:37.593]  The criminals all move there.
[03:15:37.593 --> 03:15:38.814]  It's a war zone every day.
[03:15:38.814 --> 03:15:41.436]  We know that common sense, but we know the globalists.
[03:15:41.436 --> 03:15:45.779]  We know Sarah Brady's on record saying we can't have a socialist America until we disarm the American people.
[03:15:45.779 --> 03:15:51.203]  We know for UNIDIR at the UN, they say the power monopoly of the state, everyone must be disarmed.
[03:15:51.203 --> 03:15:53.424]  State Senator Obama believed in total gun bans.
[03:15:53.424 --> 03:15:54.705]  The Attorney General believes in it.
[03:15:55.626 --> 03:16:06.997]  We know that they want our guns to enslave us, but the average moron who's scared of guns, who's domesticated, who was brought up by domesticated, gelded people, they're not really bad, they're just ignorant.
[03:16:06.997 --> 03:16:14.904]  And it's just like people who wouldn't let folks hunt wolves or coyotes or wildcats or alligators in, you know, places like major cities in Florida.
[03:16:14.904 --> 03:16:18.567]  Now they're killing people, they're killing dogs, they're coming into yards.
[03:16:18.567 --> 03:16:21.350]  Now even the socialists are saying, yeah, somebody kill these
[03:16:21.850 --> 03:16:22.711]  Alligators.
[03:16:22.711 --> 03:16:24.271]  Somebody killed these wildcats.
[03:16:24.271 --> 03:16:25.272]  They just killed my kid.
[03:16:25.272 --> 03:16:29.514]  You know, kids get killed every year because they like small prey in California.
[03:16:29.514 --> 03:16:31.215]  And now wildcats are all over L.A.
[03:16:31.215 --> 03:16:32.416]  trying to eat people.
[03:16:32.416 --> 03:16:33.516]  It's the same thing.
[03:16:33.516 --> 03:16:34.357]  They take the guns.
[03:16:34.357 --> 03:16:35.717]  Crime rates explode.
[03:16:35.717 --> 03:16:36.918]  And I've seen all the statistics.
[03:16:36.918 --> 03:16:40.860]  We're becoming a pro-gun nation again and rediscovering why it's so important.
[03:16:40.860 --> 03:16:50.585]  That's got to make these social globalists, these parasites angry that either way you cut it, we are shifting the momentum against them.
[03:16:50.985 --> 03:16:52.086]  You are correct.
[03:16:52.086 --> 03:17:03.392]  The polls have been, over really the decades, showing a trend in the direction of understanding and wanting to apply the Second Amendment.
[03:17:03.392 --> 03:17:08.995]  And this is something that is totally inconsistent with the socialist worldview.
[03:17:08.995 --> 03:17:14.879]  They assume that they take charge of all, at least important, decisions in our lives.
[03:17:15.499 --> 03:17:21.942]  And for them, an important decision, evidently, is what kind of food we might be allowed to eat.
[03:17:21.942 --> 03:17:28.424]  I don't have anything to say on behalf of junk food, but if somebody wants to do that, well, less power to them.
[03:17:28.424 --> 03:17:29.485]  It's okay with me.
[03:17:29.485 --> 03:17:32.426]  It's not my job to tell somebody what to eat.
[03:17:32.426 --> 03:17:35.027]  So, that's the mindset of these people.
[03:17:35.027 --> 03:17:37.148]  They are control freaks.
[03:17:37.148 --> 03:17:42.090]  And getting back to your earlier point, they might, as you say, be upset about
[03:17:43.210 --> 03:17:45.672]  An extra wildcat in the neighborhood.
[03:17:45.672 --> 03:17:52.396]  But they don't have a problem so much with criminals because criminals don't operate within their gated communities.
[03:17:52.396 --> 03:18:02.403]  They'll be safe almost all the time from the criminal element and so it's an easy price for them to pay because they don't have to pay the price.
[03:18:02.403 --> 03:18:12.089]  The elite in England hasn't had to pay the price of the rising crime rate following the confiscation of virtually all the legal guns in the country.
[03:18:12.589 --> 03:18:20.036]  And even though crime has multiplied, literally multiplied, the rich and famous don't ever get to see that.
[03:18:20.036 --> 03:18:25.620]  It may be on television, but it's never something that affects them directly, so it's no big deal.
[03:18:25.620 --> 03:18:30.404]  And they use our tax money to pay for government and private security.
[03:18:30.404 --> 03:18:32.546]  Larry, what about the realignment?
[03:18:33.427 --> 03:18:37.750]  Pro-establishment Republicans and Democrats are losing every major primary.
[03:18:37.750 --> 03:18:41.753]  This is a major political realignment, not in parties, but for liberty.
[03:18:41.753 --> 03:18:43.033]  The system is panicking.
[03:18:43.033 --> 03:18:44.695]  Obama is in free fall.
[03:18:44.695 --> 03:18:49.878]  And some of his top advisors are saying, Obama needs another Oklahoma City or 9-11.
[03:18:49.878 --> 03:18:52.060]  That's pretty creepy to hear that.
[03:18:52.060 --> 03:18:54.401]  What do you think Obama and his people are going to do?
[03:18:54.401 --> 03:18:56.763]  They're not going to give up power easily.
[03:18:56.763 --> 03:19:01.566]  It is a worrisome thought, and columnists are beginning to speculate that something
[03:19:02.386 --> 03:19:03.869]  Uh, like that might be in store.
[03:19:03.869 --> 03:19:06.193]  Obviously he brought us a financial crisis.
[03:19:06.193 --> 03:19:08.959]  Thanks to years of incredibly stupid.
[03:19:09.448 --> 03:19:17.113]  I think one thing we've seen a little foretaste is election thuggery, particularly at the general election chasing away Republican voters with the new Black Panther Party.
[03:19:37.657 --> 03:19:40.258]  Well, those are amazing tapes that are out there.
[03:19:40.258 --> 03:19:44.060]  Let's talk about Arizona when we get back, and treason.
[03:19:44.060 --> 03:19:47.261]  I mean, Obama, I don't know if you've seen the Senator Kyle video.
[03:19:47.261 --> 03:19:50.542]  We could play it for you if you haven't, but he was saying he met with Obama.
[03:19:50.542 --> 03:19:52.203]  Obama said, I want the crisis down there.
[03:19:52.203 --> 03:19:53.664]  I want to get amnesty passed.
[03:19:53.664 --> 03:19:54.544]  I need that crisis.
[03:19:54.544 --> 03:19:57.405]  I mean, if that is an impeachable offense, I don't know what is.
[03:19:57.405 --> 03:19:58.366]  Larry Pratt's our guest.
[03:19:58.366 --> 03:19:58.926]  Stay with us.
[03:20:00.322 --> 03:20:03.284]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:20:03.284 --> 03:20:07.446]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[03:20:07.446 --> 03:20:09.707]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:20:09.707 --> 03:20:14.870]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:16.691]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:20:16.691 --> 03:20:18.232]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:20:18.232 --> 03:20:19.733]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:20:19.733 --> 03:20:22.775]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:20:23.095 --> 03:20:28.459]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:20:28.459 --> 03:20:37.806]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights and measures.
[03:20:37.806 --> 03:20:40.168]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:20:40.168 --> 03:20:41.549]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[03:20:46.152 --> 03:20:46.472]  We're good.
[03:21:04.148 --> 03:21:05.409]  Tyranny is here.
[03:21:05.409 --> 03:21:09.273]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:21:09.273 --> 03:21:11.576]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:21:11.576 --> 03:21:17.462]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:21:17.462 --> 03:21:23.708]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:21:24.108 --> 03:21:30.092]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:21:30.092 --> 03:21:34.254]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:21:34.254 --> 03:21:38.557]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:21:38.557 --> 03:21:44.500]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:21:44.500 --> 03:21:48.062]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:21:48.062 --> 03:21:50.043]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:21:50.043 --> 03:21:50.464]  It's here.

[03:22:03.865 --> 03:22:04.866]  Afraid to answer it?
[03:22:05.811 --> 03:22:07.693]  Afraid to answer your door?
[03:22:07.693 --> 03:22:15.001]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:22:15.001 --> 03:22:17.224]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:22:17.224 --> 03:22:19.246]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:22:19.246 --> 03:22:22.910]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another
[03:22:22.910 --> 03:22:23.130]  I think so.

[03:22:59.406 --> 03:23:02.208]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[03:23:02.208 --> 03:23:07.453]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[03:23:07.453 --> 03:23:10.215]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[03:23:10.215 --> 03:23:13.838]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.

[03:23:23.906 --> 03:23:29.268]  It contains two weeks of delicious easy-to-fix food along with the equipment to prepare it.
[03:23:29.268 --> 03:23:32.309]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[03:23:32.309 --> 03:23:36.670]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[03:23:36.670 --> 03:23:41.932]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods and storms must be escaped.
[03:23:41.932 --> 03:23:45.733]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[03:23:45.733 --> 03:23:50.734]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack from efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:50.734 --> 03:23:51.014]  Call 800-409-5633
[03:23:53.575 --> 03:24:05.423]  Larry Pratt with us for another 15 minutes, and I'm going to open the phones up specifically
[03:24:13.268 --> 03:24:20.038]  On the headline, top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama, with a bizarre quote.
[03:24:20.038 --> 03:24:27.769]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, said Shapiro, adding he has to find some way between now and November.
[03:24:28.530 --> 03:24:37.412]  Of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and, short of a 9-11 event or Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think of how he could do that.
[03:24:37.412 --> 03:24:40.713]  Larry, I know I brought this up to you, but I really want to get your take on it specifically.
[03:24:40.713 --> 03:24:43.554]  That's out of the Financial Times of London.
[03:24:43.554 --> 03:24:48.295]  And the media is everywhere saying he's in free fall.
[03:24:48.295 --> 03:24:52.876]  Whereas he has 40% supporting him, only 13% total have confidence.
[03:24:52.876 --> 03:24:56.017]  I mean, this guy looks like he may be the most unpopular president in history.
[03:24:56.537 --> 03:24:57.638]  He's working on it.
[03:24:57.638 --> 03:24:59.059]  I think he may get there.
[03:24:59.059 --> 03:25:01.941]  And I don't think he's incompetent.
[03:25:01.941 --> 03:25:12.988]  My take on this guy, and you and I have talked about it from even before he was elected, and I know I published a column before he was elected pointing out that he was a Marxist thug.
[03:25:13.698 --> 03:25:31.938]  Well, he, true to Saul Alinsky, the Rules for Radicals author who explained how to tear down a system and have it implode on itself by just overloading it with too much welfare, voter fraud, all kinds of financial crisis, you name it.
[03:25:31.938 --> 03:25:34.321]  The guy's working very hard to destroy
[03:25:35.061 --> 03:25:36.842]  And he's working very fast at it.
[03:25:36.842 --> 03:25:37.803]  He's done a pretty good job.
[03:25:37.803 --> 03:25:38.563]  Well, they even admit that.
[03:25:38.563 --> 03:25:43.086]  I mean, if you're going to build the new socialist utopia, you've got to destroy the old house that was there.
[03:25:43.086 --> 03:25:44.727]  They want to destroy this country.
[03:25:44.727 --> 03:25:45.548]  Absolutely.
[03:25:45.548 --> 03:25:48.110]  And there's just no question.
[03:25:48.110 --> 03:25:51.432]  That's not incompetence down in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:25:51.432 --> 03:25:55.214]  That is a desire to get all those blankety-blank Republican voters.
[03:25:55.214 --> 03:25:56.875]  Payback time, baby.
[03:25:56.875 --> 03:26:01.858]  Now we'll teach you that you should be dependent rather than independent, rather than producers.
[03:26:01.858 --> 03:26:04.180]  You should be drones so that we can control you.
[03:26:04.893 --> 03:26:05.974]  I agree with you.
[03:26:05.974 --> 03:26:12.402]  BP is the top globalist company that, with Al Gore and Enron, created the carbon tax.
[03:26:12.402 --> 03:26:13.443]  And Ron Paul agrees.
[03:26:13.443 --> 03:26:14.824]  He thinks it's very suspicious.
[03:26:14.824 --> 03:26:18.989]  And the way they're blocking any relief, I think they staged the whole thing.
[03:26:18.989 --> 03:26:24.775]  Well, if they didn't stage it, true to Rahm Emanuel, you never let a good crisis go to waste.
[03:26:24.775 --> 03:26:25.136]  But, you know,
[03:26:26.068 --> 03:26:32.272]  Obama himself is in a crisis and we should resolve not to let that crisis go to waste.
[03:26:32.272 --> 03:26:34.873]  We should take care of business as we have been.
[03:26:34.873 --> 03:26:41.777]  You mentioned before we went to the break that at least most of the primaries have been going as we would hope they would.
[03:26:41.777 --> 03:26:47.380]  Sometimes we have too many conservatives dividing the vote and a liberal gets through like Dan Coats in Indiana.
[03:26:47.380 --> 03:26:52.063]  But by and large, the results have really been very satisfactory.
[03:26:53.181 --> 03:27:01.427]  If especially somebody like Jim DeMint is able to continue doing what he's doing, the Republican caucus in the Senate will have shifted to the right.
[03:27:01.427 --> 03:27:07.251]  Enough to tell Senator McConnell to stop playing patty cakes with the Democrats?
[03:27:07.251 --> 03:27:07.991]  I don't know.
[03:27:07.991 --> 03:27:14.976]  But it's certainly going to be more difficult for Senator McConnell because some of the people that are coming owe him nothing.
[03:27:15.516 --> 03:27:17.839]  Let's shift gears to Arizona.
[03:27:17.839 --> 03:27:19.121]  Many have called it treason.
[03:27:19.121 --> 03:27:22.404]  I think it fits the definition of high treason, not just treason.
[03:27:22.404 --> 03:27:28.111]  We now have that Senator Kyle testimony that he was told they love the crisis, the kidnappings, the murder, the death.
[03:27:28.111 --> 03:27:31.595]  80 plus miles denied to citizens into the state.
[03:27:32.797 --> 03:27:34.579]  Maybe they don't remember
[03:27:52.658 --> 03:28:00.781]  The intensity and almost literally the green smoke coming up from the Capitol Hill switchboards during the amnesty fight.
[03:28:00.781 --> 03:28:14.786]  That really got the country angry and there were groups out there encouraging people to make calls but there was also just a lot of spontaneous effort because people couldn't believe that we're going to allow
[03:28:15.732 --> 03:28:25.514]  Not only to continue such law-breaking as just walk into our country, la-dee-da, and then have no regard for the danger it puts people in.
[03:28:25.514 --> 03:28:32.376]  The rancher just, what, two, three, four months ago that was murdered on his own land down on the border.
[03:28:32.376 --> 03:28:39.398]  And this was a guy known to have helped illegals that were in danger of dying of thirst.
[03:28:40.679 --> 03:28:43.262]  And yet, no good deed goes unpunished.
[03:28:43.262 --> 03:28:46.845]  And that doesn't seem to bother Obama, because again, he lives in a gated community.
[03:28:46.845 --> 03:28:48.267]  It's called the White House.
[03:28:48.267 --> 03:28:51.129]  And you can't get close to him for anything.
[03:28:51.129 --> 03:28:53.432]  So he's, no problem there.
[03:28:53.432 --> 03:28:54.733]  What border problem are you talking about?
[03:28:54.773 --> 03:28:55.394]  They've been in a race.
[03:28:55.394 --> 03:28:58.976]  They know Mexico and the State Department has been collapsing for four years.
[03:28:58.976 --> 03:29:00.958]  It's now officially a failed state.
[03:29:00.958 --> 03:29:04.661]  They had to merge us with Mexico in the SPP before it collapsed.
[03:29:04.661 --> 03:29:10.326]  Now they're behind schedule and they're saying, get rid of the border, legalize everybody as Mexico collapses?
[03:29:10.646 --> 03:29:15.213]  Well, the audacity of saying, well, we'll build the wall as soon as you agree to amnesty.
[03:29:15.213 --> 03:29:21.282]  Well, isn't that kind of like closing the door after the barn door after the horse got out?
[03:29:21.282 --> 03:29:22.884]  Please.
[03:29:22.884 --> 03:29:26.009]  Well, that's like plugging a hole in the bottom of a ship after it's on the bottom.
[03:29:26.009 --> 03:29:26.209]  Yeah.
[03:29:27.831 --> 03:29:28.832]  Exactly right.
[03:29:28.832 --> 03:29:30.073]  They think we're that stupid.
[03:29:30.073 --> 03:29:31.293]  I, well, we'll see.
[03:29:31.293 --> 03:29:44.862]  Larry, I want to just briefly on the other side of the millennium, because I know you're busy, get any other key battles around the country and worldwide for the right to keep and bear arms and where the victim disarmament movement is, how they're regrouping against free humanity.
[03:29:44.862 --> 03:29:46.903]  Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America is our guest.
[03:29:46.903 --> 03:29:48.044]  Gunowners.org.
[03:29:48.044 --> 03:29:50.426]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:50.426 --> 03:29:51.827]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.827 --> 03:29:53.348]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.333 --> 03:29:57.025]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.580 --> 03:30:03.582]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[03:30:03.582 --> 03:30:05.643]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[03:30:05.643 --> 03:30:08.405]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[03:30:08.405 --> 03:30:10.626]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[03:30:10.626 --> 03:30:12.047]  Okay, here it comes.
[03:30:12.047 --> 03:30:13.948]  But first, the facts.
[03:30:13.948 --> 03:30:15.869]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[03:30:15.869 --> 03:30:17.850]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[03:30:17.850 --> 03:30:21.552]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[03:30:21.552 --> 03:30:29.297]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[03:30:29.297 --> 03:30:29.897]  Sinofresh.

[03:31:00.359 --> 03:31:02.762]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:02.762 --> 03:31:05.064]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:05.064 --> 03:31:08.168]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:08.168 --> 03:31:13.374]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:13.374 --> 03:31:17.579]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:17.879 --> 03:31:20.242]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:20.242 --> 03:31:23.125]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:23.125 --> 03:31:26.048]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:26.048 --> 03:31:33.657]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:33.979 --> 03:31:39.363]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:39.363 --> 03:31:41.684]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:41.684 --> 03:31:45.907]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:45.907 --> 03:31:46.987]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:46.987 --> 03:31:48.328]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:48.328 --> 03:31:49.829]  Invisible Empire.

[03:33:04.904 --> 03:33:13.468]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.468 --> 03:33:14.529]  We are back live.
[03:33:14.529 --> 03:33:15.689]  Larry Pratt is our guest.
[03:33:15.689 --> 03:33:28.755]  I'm going to open the phones up for quick comments on police all over the nation, governments holding people hostage, saying we won't respond to your house being broken into, you name it, if you don't let us raise your taxes.
[03:33:28.755 --> 03:33:29.916]  That's basically what's going on.
[03:33:29.916 --> 03:33:32.377]  The globalists get you dependent, then they hold you.
[03:33:33.217 --> 03:33:37.121]  Hostage 1-800-259-9231.
[03:33:37.121 --> 03:33:40.123]  That's the subject I want to hear from you on.
[03:33:40.123 --> 03:33:48.451]  And Obama's advisor saying we need a terror attack so he can play the part of our big daddy and we can all worship this creature.
[03:33:48.451 --> 03:33:50.132]  We know Hitler staged terror attacks.
[03:33:50.132 --> 03:33:52.214]  We know that Stalin did it.
[03:33:52.214 --> 03:33:53.475]  We know they used crises.
[03:33:54.116 --> 03:33:56.498]  They don't like to let a good crisis go to waste.
[03:33:56.498 --> 03:33:58.739]  800-259-9231.
[03:33:58.739 --> 03:34:00.701]  Finishing up with Larry Pratt.
[03:34:00.701 --> 03:34:07.406]  Larry, again, the pendulum's starting to swing, but the globalists are so well entrenched, people better intensify their actions.
[03:34:07.406 --> 03:34:16.612]  I want to get your view on that and give us just a quick state of the Second Amendment here in the Republic and some of the battles we're fighting.
[03:34:16.612 --> 03:34:20.335]  Okay, well the first one is Elena Kagan.
[03:34:20.335 --> 03:34:21.356]  It is not
[03:34:21.954 --> 03:34:29.461]  The most likely battle that we might win, but we have a chance to beat her.
[03:34:29.461 --> 03:34:36.067]  It is possible that we either can get enough backbone in the Republicans to launch a filibuster.
[03:34:36.067 --> 03:34:38.309]  They would have the votes to kill it right there.
[03:34:38.309 --> 03:34:45.716]  But it's also possible this woman has committed perjury on two occasions when she was testifying under oath.
[03:34:46.076 --> 03:34:53.043]  She said she would proceed according to a certain course of action, and she absolutely reversed course once she was in.
[03:34:53.043 --> 03:34:55.465]  I hope folks would go to gunowners.org.
[03:34:55.465 --> 03:34:58.949]  We've got alerts there that deal with this, telling the senators.
[03:34:59.736 --> 03:35:02.037]  You better not even go for this, gal.
[03:35:02.037 --> 03:35:09.419]  She's an enemy of freedom, and we're going to be hitting them, hopefully, very soon with some information on her.
[03:35:09.419 --> 03:35:18.522]  The actual lies that we've caught her in, and I think on two occasions we can actually make the case that she committed... Is there voting for confirmation next week on the 20th?
[03:35:18.522 --> 03:35:21.223]  I guess that's... That's what it's scheduled, yes.
[03:35:21.223 --> 03:35:28.725]  That's Tuesday, so... And I know you've done the research, but can you give us a little idea of what the particular perjury is?
[03:35:29.225 --> 03:35:31.347]  One, just give you one for example.
[03:35:31.347 --> 03:35:36.872]  She was testifying when, under oath, when she was up for Solicitor General, her present job.
[03:35:36.872 --> 03:35:42.216]  She was asked if she were going to pursue anything against DOMA, Defensive Marriage Act.
[03:35:42.216 --> 03:35:44.418]  And she said, nah, I'm not interested in going there.
[03:35:44.418 --> 03:35:51.003]  Almost the first thing she did when she got in was to turn around and start whacking away in the courts on that issue.
[03:35:51.003 --> 03:35:56.228]  So it seems to me that she's got herself in pretty deep
[03:35:56.808 --> 03:36:01.572]  And she didn't subject herself well to the light of day.
[03:36:01.572 --> 03:36:16.141]  So I'm hopeful that we're going to push back hard enough that some of these guys are going to, maybe this is going to be Obama's Harriet Myers, the hapless nominee that Bush put forward that was finally slapped down.
[03:36:16.141 --> 03:36:25.588]  Another thing that's going and could be very encouraging for the elections, and it would re-energize discussion of socialized medicine, which the Republicans have
[03:36:25.948 --> 03:36:30.331]  Not apparently wanted to do, and that's not a good thing.
[03:36:30.331 --> 03:36:38.636]  There's a discharge petition on Representative Steve King's measure that would just flat out repeal Obamacare.
[03:36:38.636 --> 03:36:45.200]  Now, it's not likely that Obama's going to sign it, but we need to get the members of Congress on record.
[03:36:45.200 --> 03:36:53.205]  And whether they even get to a vote, the fact is that while we work to the majority that must sign to force the vote, that signing
[03:36:53.678 --> 03:36:57.402]  List itself will be like a recorded vote.
[03:36:57.402 --> 03:36:59.425]  One more thing that we can hold over them.
[03:36:59.425 --> 03:37:06.653]  You mean after all the things that came out after the passage of the bill about what a corrupt and rotten piece of socialism it is?
[03:37:06.653 --> 03:37:08.995]  You still wouldn't vote against it?
[03:37:08.995 --> 03:37:11.859]  So I think that's a pretty powerful issue.
[03:37:12.479 --> 03:37:19.684]  And secondly, I hope people will kind of keep an eye on our colleagues at the NRA, redstate.com.
[03:37:19.684 --> 03:37:30.272]  A very widely read blog yesterday had a column by Eric Erickson on how the NRA actually tried to stop Senator Coburn's measure.
[03:37:30.692 --> 03:37:40.659]  Well, what about the Wall Street Journal a month ago ran the headline that the NRA sided with the House that's passed the bill to restrict political speech about how congressmen have voted?
[03:37:56.249 --> 03:38:02.130]  That had people's jaw dropping here in Washington and they're still taking heat for it.
[03:38:02.130 --> 03:38:05.311]  And actually we may bottle that up in the Senate.
[03:38:05.311 --> 03:38:07.952]  That's another thing folks can go to gunowners.org for.
[03:38:07.952 --> 03:38:10.613]  We've got another alert that deals with that.
[03:38:10.613 --> 03:38:12.033]  I forget the name of that bill.
[03:38:12.033 --> 03:38:12.773]  What's it called?
[03:38:12.773 --> 03:38:13.853]  DISCLOSE.
[03:38:13.853 --> 03:38:16.294]  It's an acronym for something about the light.
[03:38:16.776 --> 03:38:17.657]  That's incredible.
[03:38:42.013 --> 03:38:52.121]  They're mad because he had a way of starting up an organization from his presidential drive and Campaign for Liberty is going great guns.
[03:38:52.121 --> 03:38:55.023]  And that has them very upset.
[03:38:55.023 --> 03:39:00.327]  It's a new kid on the block and I guess they'd like to strangle it in its crib, but that isn't going to happen this time.
[03:39:00.327 --> 03:39:09.154]  Well, as you know, it's a key catalyst to get more patriot, pro-Constitution candidates in, when every time they run, they win if they've got backing.
[03:39:09.614 --> 03:39:10.275]  Absolutely.
[03:39:10.275 --> 03:39:15.840]  It's been a very successful year for that segment of the political spectrum.
[03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:17.161]  They've been doing an excellent job.
[03:39:17.865 --> 03:39:23.129]  The Tea Party is reflective of that work as well and it's brought in additional people.
[03:39:23.129 --> 03:39:28.913]  And the fact that there are lots of new people involved tells you something.
[03:39:28.913 --> 03:39:47.285]  When in a very liberal district out in California, Representative Harmon, Brad Sherman, when the people at a town hall meeting erupted in disbelief and catcalls when he said he wasn't aware of the thuggery of the new Black Panther Party during the elections,
[03:39:47.885 --> 03:39:53.429]  Up in Philadelphia in 2008, the people just shut the meeting down.
[03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:57.051]  And the guy said, well, I didn't see anything about it in the media that I read.
[03:39:57.051 --> 03:39:58.992]  Well, that's just the problem, pal.
[03:39:58.992 --> 03:40:01.053]  You're in your own dream world.
[03:40:01.053 --> 03:40:04.055]  And the rest of us aren't in that socialist cocoon.
[03:40:04.055 --> 03:40:04.856]  Well, that's right.
[03:40:04.856 --> 03:40:06.577]  Less and less people watch it.
[03:40:06.577 --> 03:40:08.718]  CNN, MSNBC are in freefall.
[03:40:08.718 --> 03:40:10.299]  And I'm not exaggerating.
[03:40:10.299 --> 03:40:12.961]  I'm not one of the, you know, even top
[03:40:13.905 --> 03:40:22.669]  Well, some ways you look at number one internet show, top 15 conservatively of talk radio, but still that's not that big for being on stations.
[03:40:22.669 --> 03:40:36.916]  But the issue is, I can look at our affiliated stations and just the stations that subscribe to Arbitron and our numbers, I have more listeners and viewers, conservatively, in my three hours than CNN's top rated show.
[03:40:36.916 --> 03:40:41.459]  There's still the prestige of Larry King having a million viewers, but I mean, I have
[03:40:42.099 --> 03:40:44.840]  Close to 300,000 podcast listeners a day.
[03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:50.100]  Our affiliates now have over 400,000 listeners for every 15 minutes.
[03:40:50.100 --> 03:40:54.821]  That's the big, you know, CUME number that the ad agencies have.
[03:40:54.821 --> 03:41:03.343]  And, I mean, if I've got over a million people every day, more than 2 million total a week, because, you know, you have regulars that come in, but the stragglers, it's about 2 million a week and growing.
[03:41:03.343 --> 03:41:04.803]  I mean, Larry King Live is a joke.
[03:41:04.803 --> 03:41:06.603]  I mean, that's why he's retiring.
[03:41:06.603 --> 03:41:08.224]  I mean, it's over for these people.
[03:41:08.224 --> 03:41:09.504]  No one is listening to them.
[03:41:09.764 --> 03:41:10.645]  Correct.
[03:41:10.645 --> 03:41:12.708]  Their numbers are in free fall.
[03:41:12.708 --> 03:41:23.761]  Every time I see something about that, it's clear that people are either not getting any information at all, but more likely, they're going to all of these alternate sources that are available.
[03:41:23.761 --> 03:41:26.063]  I don't get a daily paper delivered to my house anymore.
[03:41:26.063 --> 03:41:26.484]  Why should I?
[03:41:29.400 --> 03:41:34.842]  You have so many ways of getting information, and the information that I'm looking for wouldn't have been in the daily paper.
[03:41:34.842 --> 03:41:36.682]  Well, that brings me to my next to last question.
[03:41:36.682 --> 03:41:39.863]  Here are the two questions quickly, because I know you're busy.
[03:41:39.863 --> 03:41:41.744]  Number one, Chicago.
[03:41:41.744 --> 03:41:46.385]  How do you analyze that ruling and the hoops that Chicago wants people to jump through?
[03:41:46.385 --> 03:41:48.826]  Do you think that'll be challenged?
[03:41:48.826 --> 03:41:49.887]  Quick statement on that, sir.
[03:41:49.887 --> 03:41:54.108]  And then finally, they're openly announcing they want to censor the web and talk radio now.
[03:41:54.108 --> 03:41:56.369]  That's just proving to people what thugs they are.
[03:41:56.369 --> 03:41:56.749]  Exactly.
[03:41:56.869 --> 03:42:16.109]  Well I think in case of Chicago they're going to get away with this until they are challenged and there's the possibility that if the second Heller case which is now before the DC Court of Appeals is successful and if it's lawyered in the proper way so that it's a broad enough suit and a broad enough
[03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.830]  I think?
[03:42:38.882 --> 03:42:42.744]  I'm sorry, the second point that you wanted addressed?
[03:42:42.744 --> 03:42:47.306]  No, just finally, the open announcements that they want to tax and control the Internet.
[03:42:47.306 --> 03:42:48.887]  I think that you're correct.
[03:42:48.887 --> 03:42:54.510]  That has shown people that if they can't win the argument, they're going to try to put a gag in our mouth.
[03:42:54.510 --> 03:42:57.251]  That's what McCain-Feingold was all about.
[03:42:57.251 --> 03:42:59.772]  That's what the Disclose Act is all about.
[03:42:59.772 --> 03:43:04.975]  And if they can come up with this, and they're already starting in a few markets to set up these Soviets.
[03:43:04.975 --> 03:43:06.856]  They call them stakeholder councils.
[03:43:07.176 --> 03:43:10.497]  But the word council is Soviet in Russian.
[03:43:10.497 --> 03:43:33.127]  And these Soviets would be designed to file a liberal complaint against any station that's carrying your show or any of the other talkers and make it so that they have so much in a file at the time for renewal that they might not get their renewal.
[03:43:33.127 --> 03:43:35.568]  So stations knowing that would then start
[03:43:36.388 --> 03:43:41.811]  Figuring out, well, what kind of pablum can I offset so I don't have the expense of fighting these fights.
[03:43:41.811 --> 03:43:46.413]  And instead of stations buckling to that, they need to get more aggressive and defend the First Amendment.
[03:43:46.413 --> 03:43:50.374]  You cannot pacify these hooligans.
[03:43:50.374 --> 03:43:52.275]  I mean, this is real authoritarianism.
[03:43:52.275 --> 03:43:53.756]  These people aren't playing games.
[03:43:53.756 --> 03:43:54.156]  Correct.
[03:43:54.156 --> 03:43:57.337]  That is exactly the right thing to do.
[03:43:57.337 --> 03:44:02.640]  We need to make sure that if they want to do thuggery at the polls,
[03:44:03.320 --> 03:44:06.823]  It'll be dealt with in a proper fashion.
[03:44:06.823 --> 03:44:11.206]  We've got to be organized for that, and it goes back to the point you made earlier.
[03:44:11.206 --> 03:44:19.852]  We've got to double down and intensify our efforts, and we've all got to get involved as poll watchers and people that are right there on the scene.
[03:44:19.852 --> 03:44:29.079]  So when stuff starts to happen, you know, in Chicago, the Republican poll watcher is usually a Democrat anyway, so he's not going to pick up his cell phone and call the cops.
[03:44:29.079 --> 03:44:31.341]  We've got to be there to do those kinds of things.
[03:44:32.094 --> 03:44:37.438]  Absolutely, and instead of having one video of people intimidating voters, we'll have hundreds as we know what's going on.
[03:44:37.438 --> 03:44:40.160]  Larry Pratt, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:44:40.160 --> 03:44:41.020]  Been great to be with you.
[03:44:41.020 --> 03:44:41.781]  Thanks for having me.
[03:44:41.781 --> 03:44:42.542]  Always wonderful.
[03:44:42.542 --> 03:44:44.043]  GunOwners.org, folks.
[03:44:44.043 --> 03:44:48.346]  Go sign up there for free email alerts or become a lifetime member.
[03:44:48.346 --> 03:44:50.587]  Okay, I'm going to jam in some phone calls here.
[03:44:50.587 --> 03:44:51.608]  We have a key video.
[03:44:51.608 --> 03:44:55.271]  I don't know the title of it yet, but it's going to deal with the engineered collapse of the country.
[03:44:56.051 --> 03:44:56.291]  I don't
[03:45:17.863 --> 03:45:20.604]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in New York.
[03:45:20.604 --> 03:45:21.925]  Matt, thanks for holding.
[03:45:44.953 --> 03:45:47.556]  Alex, Matt from Mobilize the People in New York.
[03:45:47.556 --> 03:45:52.380]  By the way, we just added videos of your broadcast on MobilizeThePeople.com to get the message out.
[03:45:52.380 --> 03:45:58.366]  You and Larry are absolutely correct in your assessment of the treasonous behavior by the President and other officials.
[03:45:58.366 --> 03:46:05.172]  The bottom line is they need to be held accountable by the people, which speaks to the larger point you had earlier of accelerating the freedom movement.
[03:46:05.172 --> 03:46:07.274]  We need to be able to reach new people.
[03:46:08.054 --> 03:46:16.902]  Uh, the future of this movement, the freedom movement, depends upon the need to change the language of the debate in a way we can communicate our message so we can reach these new people.
[03:46:16.902 --> 03:46:21.706]  Um, you know, the idea of people having to get involved to promote and sustain freedom is new and scary.
[03:46:21.706 --> 03:46:23.587]  It's a scary concept for a lot of people.
[03:46:23.587 --> 03:46:26.670]  Most people are just used to sitting on their butts and not doing anything.
[03:46:26.670 --> 03:46:34.977]  And now, you know, we propose with getting up and doing something and fighting for your belief in freedom is a scary concept which paralyzes a lot of people.
[03:46:34.977 --> 03:46:35.978]  Well, here's an analogy.
[03:46:36.778 --> 03:46:51.825]  If you went to Yellowstone Park now in the rural areas, the uninhabited areas, some of the more remote areas, where they've introduced hundreds of vicious timber wolves, and you went out and poured pig blood all over yourself and tied yourself down, they would come and eat you.
[03:46:51.825 --> 03:46:53.506]  It's the same thing with tyrants.
[03:46:53.506 --> 03:47:00.309]  If we just sit there watching our TV sets and sucking our thumbs and doing nothing and not being involved, we will be overrun, we will be oppressed.
[03:47:00.689 --> 03:47:05.151]  There is no option here and I appreciate your call, Matt.
[03:47:05.151 --> 03:47:06.212]  Mary in Texas.
[03:47:06.212 --> 03:47:07.973]  Mary, you're on the air.
[03:47:07.973 --> 03:47:09.433]  Yes, Alex.
[03:47:09.433 --> 03:47:11.915]  I work with Richard Reeves on the toll road.
[03:47:11.915 --> 03:47:21.380]  I want to encourage everybody to go to turftexas.org because they are stealing from the pension funds.
[03:47:21.380 --> 03:47:24.201]  We're trying to stop that in the legislature.
[03:47:24.201 --> 03:47:28.103]  They need to go down to the legislature and work on that and try to get that stopped.
[03:47:28.996 --> 03:47:34.758]  The toll roads are going to be used to finance the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[03:47:34.758 --> 03:47:46.281]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is just a corridor that goes up from China, if you can imagine this, from China to the deep water ports in Mexico.
[03:47:47.282 --> 03:47:48.683]  I don't know.
[03:48:10.352 --> 03:48:19.860]  What I wanted to hear from you on, that's why we opened the phones up, is I want to hear from you about Obama's advisors saying they need to stage terror attack and the police saying they're not going to protect you.
[03:48:19.860 --> 03:48:21.641]  They're going to let society totally collapse.
[03:48:21.641 --> 03:48:26.024]  Now Larry Pratt agreed that's the scenario and I want to hear from you Mary.
[03:48:26.024 --> 03:48:27.045]  I want your perspective.
[03:48:27.045 --> 03:48:28.826]  What do you think about those issues?
[03:48:28.826 --> 03:48:32.469]  Let me try to explain this to you.
[03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:37.633]  The big trans-Texas corridor is being built to carry big heavy army equipment.
[03:48:38.274 --> 03:48:39.617]  What do you think of that?
[03:48:39.617 --> 03:48:43.183]  And when they have the toll roads, they're going to shut those roads down when they want!
[03:48:44.386 --> 03:48:45.486]  Hello Alex, thanks for having me on.
[03:48:45.486 --> 03:48:46.167]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[03:49:13.513 --> 03:49:16.516]  So about a month ago, I was on my way home.
[03:49:16.516 --> 03:49:19.580]  I went out and had a drink with a friend of mine.
[03:49:19.580 --> 03:49:21.622]  And I wasn't drunk or anything, really.
[03:49:21.622 --> 03:49:23.324]  I had just a couple beers.
[03:49:23.324 --> 03:49:29.971]  And on my way home, on the highway, the 101 North up here in Northern California, I was attacked by a hitchhiker.
[03:49:29.971 --> 03:49:31.012]  And so I called 9-1-1.
[03:49:31.012 --> 03:49:31.913]  I mean, it's kind of a joke.
[03:49:31.913 --> 03:49:33.435]  How did you stop for a hitchhiker?
[03:49:34.318 --> 03:49:35.299]  I didn't stop.
[03:49:35.299 --> 03:49:39.563]  He stepped in the path of the bike lane, forcing me to veer into the middle of the highway.
[03:49:39.563 --> 03:49:40.825]  Oh yeah, they do that.
[03:49:40.825 --> 03:49:46.090]  And so I called because in good conscience, I couldn't pretty much just let this crazy guy just stand outside the freeway.
[03:49:46.090 --> 03:49:46.510]  No, no, no.
[03:49:46.510 --> 03:49:47.411]  That's the message.
[03:49:47.411 --> 03:49:48.472]  That's the message.
[03:49:48.472 --> 03:49:50.074]  And that's the point I wanted to make today.
[03:49:50.074 --> 03:49:53.617]  When you call the cops, especially in these corrupt cities, they end up taking you to jail.
[03:49:53.617 --> 03:49:55.579]  They don't want you calling them.
[03:49:55.579 --> 03:49:57.201]  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
[03:49:57.201 --> 03:49:57.942]  I was pretty much...
[03:49:58.658 --> 03:50:02.643]  Incarcerated temporarily, five days deprived of freedom because they said I had a concealed weapon.
[03:50:02.643 --> 03:50:05.446]  It was a sheathed knife clearly hanging on my right side.
[03:50:05.446 --> 03:50:09.971]  The officer pretty much turned around and I'm sure the crazy hitchhiker got scared away by the lights pretty much.
[03:50:10.575 --> 03:50:24.447]  And, uh, so this little tyrant pretty much, uh, flipped out once I... So let's be clear, you're on a bicycle, you got a knife to protect yourself, California is collapsing like Mexico, it's going the exact same direction, and you went to jail for having a knife and he claimed you couldn't drink a couple beers and ride your bicycle.
[03:50:24.447 --> 03:50:28.751]  Yeah, he spins around behind me, throws me up into a street sign, and then puts me on the hood of his cruiser.
[03:50:28.991 --> 03:50:29.611]  Well, yeah, they tried to.
[03:51:01.613 --> 03:51:04.235]  So, you're rolling your own, eh?
[03:51:04.235 --> 03:51:04.995]  Me too.
[03:51:04.995 --> 03:51:08.918]  And you better keep rolling with the best, RollingPapers.com.

[03:52:00.287 --> 03:52:05.251]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:52:05.251 --> 03:52:06.252]  What have we got?
[03:52:06.252 --> 03:52:08.694]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:52:08.694 --> 03:52:09.714]  A republic.
[03:52:09.714 --> 03:52:12.356]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:52:12.356 --> 03:52:14.618]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:52:14.618 --> 03:52:16.640]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:52:16.640 --> 03:52:18.321]  So they think they own our land?
[03:52:18.321 --> 03:52:19.642]  They think they own our water?
[03:52:19.642 --> 03:52:20.263]  Children?
[03:52:20.263 --> 03:52:21.383]  Our education?
[03:52:21.383 --> 03:52:22.204]  Our money?
[03:52:22.204 --> 03:52:25.867]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:52:26.227 --> 03:52:31.194]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:52:31.194 --> 03:52:32.215]  We have the facts.
[03:52:32.215 --> 03:52:33.376]  We have the Constitution.
[03:52:33.376 --> 03:52:34.278]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:52:34.278 --> 03:52:35.179]  We have common law.
[03:52:35.179 --> 03:52:37.702]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:37.702 --> 03:52:41.467]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:52:41.587 --> 03:52:42.848]  Afraid to answer it?
[03:53:06.903 --> 03:53:08.784]  Afraid to answer your door?
[03:53:08.784 --> 03:53:16.089]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:53:16.089 --> 03:53:18.310]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:53:18.310 --> 03:53:20.332]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:53:20.332 --> 03:53:25.175]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?

[03:54:11.533 --> 03:54:14.815]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[03:54:14.815 --> 03:54:17.317]  I'm covering that coming up in the next hour.
[03:54:17.317 --> 03:54:20.319]  You can also listen on the streams at Infowars.com.
[03:54:20.319 --> 03:54:25.462]  CNN's Sanchez says dead Americans good for war against manufactured terror.
[03:54:26.483 --> 03:54:31.007]  It's such important information, ladies and gentlemen, at GCNLive.com.
[03:54:31.007 --> 03:54:40.034]  I'm going to jam in a few more of your phone calls, but first I wanted to tell people about AcolaBlue.com atmospheric water generators.
[03:54:40.034 --> 03:54:44.978]  It just looks like a water, you know, bottle system without the water bottle on top.
[03:54:44.978 --> 03:54:48.101]  Great little computerized system, grabs the water out of the air.
[03:54:48.101 --> 03:54:50.063]  Seven and a half gallons with their smallest unit.
[03:54:51.164 --> 03:54:53.685]  And it's the best, cleanest drinking water you can get, period.
[03:54:53.685 --> 03:55:00.971]  Ecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, Ecolablue.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[03:55:00.971 --> 03:55:08.978]  Check it out, a whole new way to get the purest water available, Ecolablue.com.
[03:55:08.978 --> 03:55:10.839]  Okay, I'll take a few more calls, and I love your calls.
[03:55:10.839 --> 03:55:11.860]  It's usually wide open phones.
[03:55:11.860 --> 03:55:16.704]  A lot of stations and networks don't do that in shows, but I do want to get your take on
[03:55:17.978 --> 03:55:19.779]  First of all, I don't want to waste your time.
[03:55:19.779 --> 03:55:21.559]  I just want to thank you for all you do.
[03:55:21.559 --> 03:55:24.140]  I haven't had a chance to call in, but thank you, sir.
[03:55:24.140 --> 03:55:24.920]  You are truly doing a great deed.
[03:55:45.369 --> 03:55:45.789]  Let me look.
[03:55:45.789 --> 03:55:47.750]  Thank you, Brandon, but I'm not doing a great deed.
[03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:48.790]  I'm trying to survive.
[03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:50.791]  I mean, this is tyranny coming in on us.
[03:55:50.791 --> 03:55:52.351]  This is what everybody's got to do.
[03:55:52.351 --> 03:55:53.552]  But I appreciate you.
[03:55:53.552 --> 03:55:57.073]  What do you think of this White House advisor saying Obama needs an Oklahoma City bombing?
[03:55:57.073 --> 03:55:59.494]  You know, I've been saying they're going to do that and blame it on us.
[03:55:59.494 --> 03:56:01.194]  I've been seeing the preparations.
[03:56:01.194 --> 03:56:01.815]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:56:01.815 --> 03:56:05.196]  These things have been coming for not only months now, years now.
[03:56:05.196 --> 03:56:06.596]  They've been coming in America.
[03:56:06.596 --> 03:56:07.717]  They've been coming right at us.
[03:56:07.717 --> 03:56:08.677]  The telltale signs
[03:56:09.352 --> 03:56:12.214]  Well, it's like ignoring a cockroach problem when there's two or three and a year later there's 500.
[03:56:33.978 --> 03:56:40.884]  And Winston Smith figures out the government's doing it.
[03:56:40.884 --> 03:56:41.965]  Exactly.
[03:56:41.965 --> 03:56:44.147]  And, you know, it's the same thing here, you know.
[03:56:44.147 --> 03:56:48.791]  Not only Nazi Germany and Stalin, you know, their false flag terror attacks.
[03:56:48.791 --> 03:56:51.734]  We have them here, you know, 9-11, you know, what happens next?
[03:56:51.734 --> 03:56:54.756]  Oh, we go into Iraq, we have this, then you have BP, what do you have?
[03:56:54.756 --> 03:56:56.498]  Oh, you have a new carbon tax and all this.
[03:56:57.034 --> 03:56:59.455]  And I'm sure it will come through Congress in the next couple months.
[03:56:59.455 --> 03:57:01.835]  You know, I don't understand why we're the crazy ones.
[03:57:01.835 --> 03:57:08.677]  Obviously, they want us to look like that, but nobody else... Well, they just keep saying that to ignore, you know, what you're saying, but it doesn't work anymore.
[03:57:08.677 --> 03:57:09.858]  Brandon, great call.
[03:57:09.858 --> 03:57:13.339]  Chris in Maryland, you're on the air.
[03:57:13.339 --> 03:57:14.019]  Hello?
[03:57:14.019 --> 03:57:14.899]  Yes, sir.
[03:57:14.899 --> 03:57:15.860]  Yes.
[03:57:15.860 --> 03:57:21.201]  Um, I was just thinking, I'm going to stay on top of it, because I know I don't want to agitate you today, and that's not what I'm here for.
[03:57:21.201 --> 03:57:23.462]  But, um, it reminds me of what happened during Bush.
[03:57:24.508 --> 03:57:31.892]  His ratings would fall, they would stage something, oh, we caught a terrorist here, we caught a terrorist there, then his ratings would go back up.
[03:57:31.892 --> 03:57:33.994]  It was like a seesaw the whole entire time.
[03:57:33.994 --> 03:57:40.517]  And Ridge came out in his book last year, the head of Homeland Security, and said they were staging that, and the terror alerts were fake.
[03:57:40.517 --> 03:57:43.099]  What an incredible admission.
[03:57:43.099 --> 03:57:43.839]  Exactly.
[03:57:43.839 --> 03:57:50.063]  And the sick thing is, like you say, they openly admit this garbage.
[03:57:50.063 --> 03:57:51.524]  It's absolutely sick.
[03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:55.152]  It's sadistic, it's satanic, it's evil.
[03:57:55.152 --> 03:58:08.542]  I can't even describe it in the true terms, but Eric Holder even said that in terms of that police thing that you were talking about in Oakland, that they will not stop black people from attacking white people committing crimes.
[03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:11.270]  Well, it's just total implosion.
[03:58:11.270 --> 03:58:17.312]  It's like this billboard saying National Socialist, Communist Socialist, Marxist Socialist, Democrat Socialist.
[03:58:17.312 --> 03:58:19.172]  We know what this change is.
[03:58:19.172 --> 03:58:20.573]  But Obama will go.
[03:58:20.573 --> 03:58:22.793]  He won't be there soon.
[03:58:22.793 --> 03:58:24.194]  But the tyranny will stay there.
[03:58:24.194 --> 03:58:26.855]  We've got to start removing the tyranny, not just the puppets.
[03:58:27.615 --> 03:58:31.837]  And so, everybody puts up a billboard, starts a newsletter, calls in to talk radio.
[03:58:31.837 --> 03:58:34.238]  The power of what you're doing is incredible.
[03:58:34.238 --> 03:58:38.199]  And I couldn't do it without my sponsors, the affiliates, the Genesis Network, my crew, everybody.
[03:58:38.199 --> 03:58:39.060]  God bless you.
[03:58:39.060 --> 03:58:44.101]  We couldn't do this without you.
[03:58:44.101 --> 03:58:47.863]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:54.821 --> 03:58:56.082]  Tyranny is here.
[03:58:56.082 --> 03:58:59.825]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:58:59.825 --> 03:59:02.227]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:59:02.227 --> 03:59:08.112]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:59:08.112 --> 03:59:14.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:59:14.757 --> 03:59:20.759]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:59:20.759 --> 03:59:24.920]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:59:24.920 --> 03:59:29.201]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:59:29.201 --> 03:59:35.142]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:59:35.142 --> 03:59:38.703]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:59:38.703 --> 03:59:40.684]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:59:40.684 --> 03:59:41.124]  It's here.
