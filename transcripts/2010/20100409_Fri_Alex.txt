[00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.744]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:11.325]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:12.906]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:17.068]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.068 --> 00:00:21.111]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:23.983]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:25.064]  It is April 9th, 2010.
[00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:29.349]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:37.136]  We have Bob Chapman coming up in the second hour, and we are joined by Mark Dice for the entire first hour.
[00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:45.164]  Of course, Mark Dice is featured in my newest documentary, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:00:45.164 --> 00:00:46.266]  And I did this film
[00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:52.652]  Because of really the lack of knowledge out in the culture right now.
[00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:56.596]  And even out in the culture when I was asleep ten years ago now.
[00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:59.839]  I had no idea about this stuff.
[00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.862]  And Mark, it really saddens me to see a
[00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:18.975]  A society, a once great society of manufactured, cloned puppets that suck on pop culture and really are so involved in the minutia of their favorite sports team or their favorite celebrity that they cannot see what's really going on around them.
[00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.682]  No, and that is part of the New World Order to distract everybody with bread and circus.
[00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.924]  And that's why I'm really looking forward to this film.
[00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:26.684]  Congratulations.
[00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:30.187]  It looks absolutely amazing.
[00:01:30.187 --> 00:01:31.848]  And that is what they need.
[00:01:31.848 --> 00:01:37.613]  That's why the New World Order has been able to succeed, obviously, because people aren't politically aware.
[00:01:37.613 --> 00:01:46.600]  And I think the time is right with this now, because you have a segment of the population after 9-11 that knew that it was an inside job, or that were just against the wars in general.
[00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:49.402]  That's one particular issue.
[00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:54.726]  There's a large segment of the population that obviously supported the war or just were really indifferent.
[00:01:54.726 --> 00:02:01.410]  But now that the economic collapse has happened, a lot of people are looking for answers as to why, as to who to blame.
[00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.851]  They're getting worried.
[00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:08.815]  And so now everybody's lives are affected because, you know, with 9-11, a lot of people were disconnected.
[00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:13.137]  They didn't feel a personal connection to the war, to the soldiers.
[00:02:13.137 --> 00:02:13.938]  They didn't feel that
[00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:22.681]  You know, sending the soldiers over to die necessarily affected them, but now everybody's pocketbook is the fact that everybody's talking about the economic collapse.
[00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:33.786]  Everybody wants to know, you know, what group, what sort of backroom deals led to this collapse and is continuing to just run the country down the toilet.
[00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.827]  And so I think this is just fantastic.
[00:02:35.827 --> 00:02:37.967]  I think this is the primer.
[00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.849]  It looks better than any History Channel show I've ever seen.
[00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.729]  I mean, this is going to
[00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.607]  Well, thank you so much, Mark.
[00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:47.069]  And as you were talking about the economy, you're right.
[00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.372]  Now that the Obama administration is in, we are bringing in so-called conservatives.
[00:02:52.372 --> 00:03:02.139]  Of course, you and I know that there is a false left-right paradigm out there to control both of us, to make us really choose sides and think we're part of a team.
[00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.540]  I got news for you, folks.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.641]  We're not part of any team at all.
[00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:06.942]  It's us versus them.
[00:03:06.942 --> 00:03:12.126]  You have more in common than your so-called liberal counterparts than you realize.
[00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:13.367]  And Bernanke
[00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:42.751]  To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among, and it won't be a choice, they'll be doing all of these things, among higher taxes, so they're going to raise your taxes.
[00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:49.016]  They're already taking 20, 30, sometimes 40 and 50 percent, depending on what tax bracket you're in.
[00:03:49.016 --> 00:03:58.905]  Modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and those aren't entitlement programs, those are programs we've paid into our entire lives forcibly through our paychecks.
[00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.146]  We don't really get a choice there.
[00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:06.390]  So they're going to take away those programs and raise taxes, and now they're out in the open talking about it, Mark.
[00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:23.322]  Yeah, and on another note that I want to talk to you about taxes, obviously Tax Day, April 15th, also the release of Invisible Empire, also the deadline for your extortion check to be sent in to the federal government for your income tax, and so a lot of people, obviously in this movement and this audience,
[00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:28.408]  Are involved in seeing how the tax scheme is a fraud.
[00:04:28.408 --> 00:04:32.430]  Everybody's probably seen Aaron Russo's film, America Freedom from Fascism.
[00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.371]  And some people might just think, well I'm just not going to pay him.
[00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:45.924]  And I just want to urge you that I've done that before and I can tell you that after about a year or so we'll catch up to you and you'll pay heavy fines and they're going to garnish your check.
[00:04:45.924 --> 00:04:53.411]  So even though, yes, the income tax is a fraud, it needs to be taken care of on a legislative level and if you just don't pay your taxes... We'll talk about that more on the other side.
[00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.412]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:54.412 --> 00:04:57.475]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:05.518]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:08.282]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:12.748]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:05:14.991 --> 00:05:18.072]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:23.073]  We also have some specials where you can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:26.174]  A new level in production quality and in information.
[00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:34.237]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[00:05:34.237 --> 00:05:36.077]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:05:36.077 --> 00:05:37.237]  Everybody needs to get it.
[00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:38.398]  So order yours today.
[00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:42.339]  Show it to your friends, your family, your church, your neighbors, your boss, your employees.

[00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:49.432]  Shadow Government.
[00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.653]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[00:05:51.653 --> 00:05:54.915]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.201]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:10.005]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:12.367]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:17.552]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.232 --> 00:06:24.901]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:30.890]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.595]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:36.016]  George Washington said,
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.480]  We're good to go.
[00:07:31.657 --> 00:07:34.899]  We must not let them be stolen by ambitious and evil men.
[00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:40.902]  Utopia Silver Supplements believes it is our God-given right to make our own health care decisions however we deem best.
[00:07:40.902 --> 00:07:45.965]  If we can help you with your supplement needs and better health, then help us win this health freedom battle.

[00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:52.069]  Again, 888-213-4338.
[00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:08.888]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.650]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.991]  We are back live.
[00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:14.931]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:16.352]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:08:16.352 --> 00:08:21.274]  We're streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:08:21.274 --> 00:08:22.755]  We're joined by Mark Dice.
[00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:36.220]  And I want to talk a little bit about this, because there's a crowd out there that doesn't pay their taxes, that thinks that common law is the answer, but what they don't understand is by paying your taxes, you stay out of their crosshairs and their system further.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.501]  I mean, tell us your experience with not paying your taxes, Mark.
[00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:47.584]  We admit it's not legal, we promote freedom to fascism, we're trying to get the information out there, but at the same time, we don't want to end up in a prison cell.
[00:08:47.584 --> 00:08:51.726]  We don't want the very little assets that we actually have taken away or garnished.
[00:08:52.026 --> 00:08:53.247]  Yeah, it is extortion.
[00:08:53.247 --> 00:08:54.567]  We're all in agreement on that.
[00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:57.809]  And about five years ago, I just decided to just not pay.
[00:08:57.809 --> 00:08:59.069]  I just didn't even file.
[00:08:59.069 --> 00:09:01.410]  I just said, forget about it, you know?
[00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.132]  And they sent me a few letters saying, yeah, you forgot to file.
[00:09:05.132 --> 00:09:06.833]  And of course, I just ignored all of them.
[00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:09.154]  And I just figured it would go away.
[00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:15.238]  And they started garnishing my wages at my day job.
[00:09:15.238 --> 00:09:17.940]  Which, of course, I should have known that they were going to do.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.782]  I just didn't realize.
[00:09:19.782 --> 00:09:22.504]  A year goes by and I figure they just forgot about it.
[00:09:22.504 --> 00:09:23.645]  No, no.
[00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:30.150]  Started garnishing my wages and I think I paid over a $500 fine and interest and all this stuff.
[00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:36.896]  But, you know, yesterday I posted a message on my Facebook page just reminding people to get their taxes done on time.
[00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:41.612]  You know, pay your extortion check on time so you don't have to pay the fines and the interest.
[00:09:41.612 --> 00:09:57.278]  There's a couple guys on there that were saying, oh, you're just funding, you know, you shouldn't be complaining about the New World Order because you're just funding them, you're just paying their check, you know, you're sending them the money to have them build the New World Order, and you shouldn't even complain about it.
[00:09:57.278 --> 00:09:58.158]  I'm just thinking, well,
[00:09:58.778 --> 00:10:02.721]  You know, I actually agree that the taxes are illegal.
[00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:09.467]  It is extortion, but we need to take care of this on a legislative level by just simply not paying your taxes.
[00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:12.990]  It may seem like you're protesting, but honestly, you're just a number.
[00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.111]  They don't care.
[00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:16.213]  They're going to start garnishing your wages.
[00:10:16.213 --> 00:10:17.934]  They're going to come to your door.
[00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:19.615]  They will seize your assets.
[00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:26.401]  And so there's a better way to fight the tax revolt than there is just to simply not pay.
[00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:29.382]  And people, Mark, they think that there's a silver bullet out there.
[00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:32.383]  They think that there's these solutions that are going to happen overnight.
[00:10:32.383 --> 00:10:33.464]  I have the solution.
[00:10:33.464 --> 00:10:39.926]  They believe in phony documents and underground SEAL teams that are ready to save us at a moment's notice.
[00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:41.567]  No, that's not how the world works.
[00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:43.328]  You have to work towards a goal.
[00:10:43.328 --> 00:10:44.849]  You have to gain momentum.
[00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:48.490]  You have to get people behind an idea and you have to mobilize them.
[00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.452]  I think that civil disobedience is one of the greatest ways that we can achieve these kind of goals.
[00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:55.852]  But first, we have to educate the public.
[00:10:55.852 --> 00:11:10.517]  We have to explain to them their methods, their modes of control, the organizations out there that really do matter, that do pull the strings, that set the policy, that sit in the boardrooms and decide what your and my life is going to look like in the next five to ten years.
[00:11:10.517 --> 00:11:15.139]  Yeah, we get more people like Congressman Ron Paul on our side.
[00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:17.980]  We start taking part in massive past-day protests.
[00:11:19.073 --> 00:11:24.143]  Just getting hundreds of thousands, millions of people in multiple cities clamoring.
[00:11:24.143 --> 00:11:25.045]  We use film.
[00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:29.084]  Like Invisible Empire and others to educate those that aren't aware.
[00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:33.187]  You know, some people in the audience may think that they already know everything that there is to know.
[00:11:33.187 --> 00:11:41.392]  Maybe they're obsessed with researching this as we are, but I guarantee you that there's stuff out there and little aspects of this that we don't know about.
[00:11:41.392 --> 00:11:45.835]  And I, myself, become very educated even from your films and from other films.
[00:11:45.835 --> 00:11:50.158]  And as much as I obsess about this and research this, I certainly don't know everything.
[00:11:50.938 --> 00:11:56.120]  And so the films are great, especially some people think, oh, this is just the same old stuff rehashed.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.860]  Well, then maybe it's not for you.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.021]  Maybe it's for your friends and your family.
[00:12:00.021 --> 00:12:08.563]  And so instead of sending them a link to a YouTube video and saying, here, check this out, maybe you should have everybody over for a party and watch it on your 50-inch flat screen.
[00:12:08.563 --> 00:12:10.564]  And that's how you're going to get the message across.
[00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:14.325]  Because everybody's so busy, you send someone a link to one-tenth of the part of
[00:12:15.054 --> 00:12:23.759]  I think I saw Alex did a quick video urging viewing parties which is probably the best thing to do because I'd rather watch it on a 50 inch flat screen than watching it on a tiny little laptop computer.
[00:12:40.572 --> 00:12:46.035]  Or you have it at your local church or community center and you get one of those projectors and it's actually on a movie screen.
[00:12:46.035 --> 00:12:50.038]  I can't tell you how many times we did that with Loose Change and Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:12:50.038 --> 00:12:54.921]  In fact, I want to play a sneak peek right now of Invisible Empire.
[00:12:54.921 --> 00:12:58.943]  And this is a section dealing with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:12:58.943 --> 00:13:02.245]  It features G. Edward Griffin and we're going to come back after that.
[00:13:02.245 --> 00:13:07.449]  So this is a brand new sneak peek of my latest film coming out April 15th, Tax Day.
[00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:09.470]  Invisible Empire, a new world order to find.
[00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:19.013]  Here's a short sneak peek from the Council on Foreign Relations Roundtable Group section from Invisible Empire.
[00:13:19.013 --> 00:13:26.397]  In all of the British dependencies, these organizations, the front groups, were called the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[00:13:27.577 --> 00:13:30.158]  In the United States, they chose a different name.
[00:13:30.158 --> 00:13:33.198]  They chose the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:13:33.198 --> 00:13:39.740]  But it held exactly the same relationship to this inner society of Cecil Rhodes.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:55.444]  Among the charter members were W. April Harriman of Union Banking, then President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson's main advisor, Colonel Edward Mendel House, John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil, banking mogul J.P.
[00:13:55.444 --> 00:13:55.764]  Morgan,
[00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:06.287]  Well, the Council on Foreign Relations exists today.
[00:14:06.287 --> 00:14:10.589]  It's probably the most powerful single organization in America.
[00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:18.133]  Many observers, including myself, believe that it is the hidden government of the United States.
[00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:22.235]  These people are not elected to office, and most Americans don't even know who they are.
[00:14:23.736 --> 00:14:27.240]  But they are holding all of the important positions in society.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.224]  There are only about 4,000 of them in the United States.
[00:14:30.224 --> 00:14:32.506]  But I don't care what organization you want to look at.
[00:14:32.506 --> 00:14:39.274]  Whether it's government, or whether it's universities, or the large media centers, or whatever it is.
[00:14:39.274 --> 00:14:42.417]  You look at the people at the tops of those organizations.
[00:14:43.138 --> 00:15:00.559]  The owners, the managers, the CEOs, the board of directors, and I'm going to say probably 80 to 90% of the great power centers of America are dominated by just those 4,000 people who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:15:01.087 --> 00:15:17.752]  That was just a short clip from Invisible Empire where we're chronicling how the shadow government controls society through groups like the Council on Foreign Relations that operate as front groups for the roundtable group intelligence systems that control our society from behind the throne.
[00:15:20.478 --> 00:15:25.960]  There it is folks, Invisible Empire, a new world order to find at PrisonPlanet.tv first, and we're streaming there live.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:32.001]  I also want to remind people to support AkolaBlue.com, Akola Blue fresh water from the air.
[00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:36.383]  You don't even need a source, it makes up to seven and a half gallons of water per day.
[00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:38.283]  Call them at 1-800-691-6043 or go to AkolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O-Blue.com.
[00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:46.807]  Mark, that's just a small snippet of my film.
[00:15:46.807 --> 00:16:05.065]  It's two hours and twelve minutes, and I really think that G. Edward Griffin, being one of the primary characters in the Patriot movement, somebody who's been around for, I believe, fifty plus years, he made movies like Katanga, The Capitalist Conspiracy, back in the seventies, when really all she had was, well,
[00:16:05.726 --> 00:16:07.387]  Not even a PowerPoint presentation.
[00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:09.908]  It was literally slides on a projector.
[00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:29.877]  And to progress to the level where we're using After Effects, we're using Final Cut Pro, we're not only getting to the level of the History Channel, but surpassing it in many ways, is very exciting to me because I feel like not only are we going to reach a younger audience, a newer audience, but it's going to hold true with our already great audience out there who can make copies and hand it out to people.
[00:16:30.717 --> 00:16:47.153]  And unfortunately, you can put together a tremendous film or even just a videotape of a speech of somebody and this isn't going to have the impact because we're so used to the MTV style, quick graphics and just incredible sound.
[00:16:47.153 --> 00:16:49.235]  You're sort of playing their game.
[00:16:49.235 --> 00:16:50.777]  You're culture jamming the system.
[00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:55.301]  You're using their own game against them, which I think is fantastic.
[00:16:56.155 --> 00:17:08.822]  Well, I've often talked to you about how we're going to win this thing, and I said if we don't have our own media arm, if we don't have our own competition for CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News, we truly are going to be doomed.
[00:17:08.822 --> 00:17:20.488]  We do need something like InfoWars and Prison Planet that pumps out 25 stories a day, that pumps out three or four documentaries a year, that keeps up on the activism front, that keeps people
[00:17:20.948 --> 00:17:24.109]  In tune with the real news, the real issues.
[00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:36.653]  How else are we supposed to compete with literal multi-billion and trillion dollar corporations like General Electric and Westinghouse that own NBC and all of these other huge networks?
[00:17:36.653 --> 00:17:45.675]  Well, the Alex Jones Radio Show is fantastic, too, because we do need, you know, a daily radio show of several hours because, I mean, what are you going to choose from?
[00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:48.756]  Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, I mean,
[00:17:49.403 --> 00:18:01.035]  You know, even if you're a conservative, okay, some of their issues that they talk about might be interesting, but once you understand that they aren't just a bunch of propagandists and a bunch of gatekeepers, you need some sort of an alternative.
[00:18:01.035 --> 00:18:07.341]  So, you know, the Alex Jones Show, other shows like it, are just perfect because you can sit there and you can download the mp3.
[00:18:07.341 --> 00:18:08.742]  They have the great guests.
[00:18:08.742 --> 00:18:11.085]  Occasionally, the mainstream media will get a guest.
[00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:19.390]  Gerald Cilente on, or Peter Schiff, but you know, it's very rare, and it's for one segment, that you maybe get five minutes of their knowledge.
[00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:36.262]  So you get Alex Jones Show, other shows, your show, and you know, you can get these people on there, and you'll interview them for a half an hour, 45 minutes, or for a full hour, to get a more comprehensive understanding, instead of just a soundbite mentality of the rare occurrence of Peter Schiff or any of these other
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.581]  We're good to go.
[00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:53.051]  Absolutely, and when you're listening to this mainline garbage, you're fitting the mold that they're really crafting for you.
[00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:55.634]  They want you to be on one side or the other.
[00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.175]  They don't want you to look at both sides.
[00:18:57.175 --> 00:19:06.905]  I often look at both sides of the picture, the right perspective, the left perspective, and of course our perspective, so that I can take those and analyze them and find out what
[00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:08.927]  What is the real deal?
[00:19:08.927 --> 00:19:10.688]  What does the evidence point towards?
[00:19:10.688 --> 00:19:12.129]  What can we do to stop this?
[00:19:12.129 --> 00:19:15.452]  How do we educate people about these issues?
[00:19:15.452 --> 00:19:22.998]  And obviously, like you said, the economy is a huge hot-button issue and it's being manipulated on all fronts right now.
[00:19:22.998 --> 00:19:26.982]  In fact, the New York Times is running a headline when they're saying, why so glum?
[00:19:26.982 --> 00:19:28.583]  Numbers point to a recovery.
[00:19:28.883 --> 00:19:38.229]  Yes, they point to a recovery when the banks are giving out record numbers to their own associates while they take your pension funds.
[00:19:38.229 --> 00:19:42.312]  That's right, record bonuses for their guys as they take your pension funds.
[00:19:42.312 --> 00:19:44.953]  As Bernanke gets up and says we have to raise taxes.
[00:19:44.953 --> 00:19:48.756]  Back after this, it's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:04.868]  How would you like to own a pair of the most unique gloves in the world?

[00:21:00.629 --> 00:21:03.010]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.211]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.211 --> 00:21:08.533]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:13.636]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.636 --> 00:21:17.838]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.158 --> 00:21:20.619]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.619 --> 00:21:23.040]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.302]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.302 --> 00:21:33.905]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.225 --> 00:21:39.630]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.473]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.473 --> 00:21:46.177]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.177 --> 00:21:47.238]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.238 --> 00:21:48.599]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.081]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.791]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:06.953]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:09.214]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:09.214 --> 00:22:14.396]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:22:14.396 --> 00:22:16.216]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:22:16.216 --> 00:22:17.757]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:22:17.757 --> 00:22:19.238]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:22:19.238 --> 00:22:22.619]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:22:22.619 --> 00:22:27.621]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:22:27.961 --> 00:22:37.327]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights and measures.
[00:22:37.327 --> 00:22:42.490]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.973]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[00:22:45.973 --> 00:22:49.775]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.775 --> 00:22:51.896]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[00:22:51.896 --> 00:22:52.057]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:57.601 --> 00:22:57.782]  It's 2237.
[00:22:59.649 --> 00:23:01.390]  Oh, my sinuses!
[00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.330]  They feel like they'll explode!
[00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.151]  Sinus pressure.
[00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.911]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:23:05.911 --> 00:23:07.172]  You've struggled for years.
[00:23:07.172 --> 00:23:13.014]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:23:13.014 --> 00:23:13.774]  Sound familiar?
[00:23:13.774 --> 00:23:14.814]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:23:14.814 --> 00:23:18.456]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:23:18.456 --> 00:23:23.518]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[00:23:23.518 --> 00:23:26.158]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor-recommended.
[00:23:26.158 --> 00:23:27.379]  Sinofresh homeopathic anesthetic.
[00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:31.481]  I think so.
[00:24:29.383 --> 00:24:31.085]  And there's nothing but love in my heart.
[00:24:31.085 --> 00:24:33.307]  I am Jason Burmess, in for Alex Jones.
[00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:34.268]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:34.268 --> 00:24:36.349]  We're joined by Mark Dice.
[00:24:39.059 --> 00:24:54.095]  I really want to talk about being mesmerized, hypnotized by the system, because, again, I can remember myself in 99, 2000, even after the 9-11 attacks without really looking into it, just being totally brain damaged and dead.
[00:24:54.716 --> 00:24:58.157]  It was only 9-11 that got me even involved in the mainstream media.
[00:24:58.157 --> 00:25:05.419]  That's where I started watching these 24-hour news networks, starting to realize that geopolitics was important.
[00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:08.479]  Before that, I was watching Temptation Island.
[00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:11.200]  I was watching every garbage show that's out there.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:18.642]  I would probably still be the guy watching Jersey Shore or some other crap like that if I hadn't awakened to the real system.
[00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:18.902]  In fact,
[00:25:19.222 --> 00:25:21.883]  Later on tonight, I'm going to be on Tap Out Radio.
[00:25:21.883 --> 00:25:32.986]  A lot of people out there know that I'm a huge MMA fan, but I'm going to have the opportunity for an hour to reach out to an audience that 90% of them probably don't have any idea what I'm going to talk about.
[00:25:32.986 --> 00:25:36.727]  I can introduce them to an idea like the New World Order.
[00:25:36.727 --> 00:25:41.168]  And quite frankly, when I first watched Road to Tyranny, Alex Jones's film,
[00:25:41.568 --> 00:25:42.529]  About 9-11.
[00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:46.732]  Not only did I not want to believe it, but I was uncomfortable with the term New World Order.
[00:25:46.732 --> 00:25:50.555]  I was like, why doesn't this guy stick to global elite or something like this?
[00:25:50.555 --> 00:25:52.797]  New World Order makes him sound like a kook.
[00:25:52.797 --> 00:25:58.922]  It makes him sound like all those Christians that think that the world is going to end and the rapture is about to come here.
[00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:00.704]  I don't want to hear that.
[00:26:00.704 --> 00:26:05.448]  But as I progressed, Mark, as I learned more and more and more, I realized, hey, wait a minute.
[00:26:05.948 --> 00:26:09.650]  New World Order is their term, and that's why I made this film.
[00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:15.653]  I made this film because I'm taking their propaganda and using it against them, and I'm showing what it's really about.
[00:26:15.653 --> 00:26:30.120]  I'm exposing that a New World Order is truly a government in which the state is God, where they micromanage your entire life in a cashless society control grid, where your every single move is tracked, traced, and databased through an RFID
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:36.344]  We're not saying that you need to completely smash your television and never watch anything again.
[00:26:36.344 --> 00:26:39.426]  Of course, with moderation, it's good to have your entertainment.
[00:26:39.426 --> 00:26:41.267]  You have your MMA fights for entertainment, and it's okay.
[00:26:55.204 --> 00:27:00.811]  Most people watch as much television as they do as a person who has a part-time or even a full-time job.
[00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:01.692]  That's the problem.
[00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:05.901]  And so you have this high-tech system and our celebrities are built up.
[00:27:05.901 --> 00:27:10.564]  Let's just look at some of the celebrities and what they've done with their lives.
[00:27:10.564 --> 00:27:13.866]  You have Sober House with Dr. Drew or Celebrity Rehab.
[00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:16.627]  You know, these icons that are built up.
[00:27:16.627 --> 00:27:18.548]  And that's what they've done with their lives.
[00:27:18.548 --> 00:27:20.129]  They have destroyed their lives.
[00:27:20.129 --> 00:27:26.173]  And that's really what the New World Order wants you to do so that you're not going to go to a protest, so that you're not going to be educated.
[00:27:26.173 --> 00:27:29.195]  So they want you to just waste away your life in this
[00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:30.801]  Thank you.
[00:27:48.095 --> 00:27:51.796]  Am I wasting hours of my day or of my week?
[00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:55.017]  You know, could I be doing at least something more productive?
[00:27:55.017 --> 00:27:57.717]  Could I be having fun with my friends and family?
[00:27:57.717 --> 00:28:00.098]  Could I be out exercising, doing a hobby?
[00:28:00.098 --> 00:28:03.599]  You know, enjoying nature?
[00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:04.779]  Something to that effect.
[00:28:04.779 --> 00:28:15.602]  And that's a major goal of the New World Order is to hypnotize us to create a standard of both immorality and selfishness
[00:28:16.582 --> 00:28:25.292]  And some people criticize me all because I'm just a Christian and I said it, but even from a secular standpoint, you have to admit that it's horrific what's happening in society.
[00:28:25.292 --> 00:28:30.318]  We have kids doing things that they really should not be doing.
[00:28:30.318 --> 00:28:35.203]  There's new phenomena going on in the culture that people are just utterly shocked.
[00:28:36.364 --> 00:28:37.065]  I'm shocked.
[00:28:37.065 --> 00:28:38.626]  I mean, Jason, we're about the same age.
[00:28:38.626 --> 00:28:42.988]  I'm only 32, and I still just look around at how much the world has changed in 10 years.
[00:28:42.988 --> 00:28:48.832]  No, I can't believe that 10-year-old girls idolize whores like Paris Hilton as if they're real celebrities.
[00:28:48.832 --> 00:28:57.117]  No, they're celebritards that were born into billions of dollars who have wasted their life on the literal most shallow things you could care about without having...
[00:28:57.797 --> 00:29:01.141]  Any semblance of reality that surrounds them.
[00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:04.105]  They have no idea what the real world is like.
[00:29:04.105 --> 00:29:08.070]  They spend their lives going around to these little parties, getting coked up.
[00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:12.795]  And little girls, small girls, your daughters, your nephews, your nieces...
[00:29:13.576 --> 00:29:19.598]  You're the people that are going to grow up and supposed to take care of you when you're old are not going to have a moral compass.
[00:29:19.598 --> 00:29:23.339]  They are going to watch things like celebrity rehab and think, you know what?
[00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:24.799]  I should be partying my entire life.
[00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:28.680]  They don't see that that could turn into them that they're going to crash and burn.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.901]  No, they want to be like these rocks.
[00:29:31.121 --> 00:29:33.043]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:33.043 --> 00:29:34.564]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:03.900]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:09.243]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.243 --> 00:30:11.283]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.283 --> 00:30:16.286]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.286 --> 00:30:17.466]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.466 --> 00:30:18.587]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.587 --> 00:30:20.467]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.467 --> 00:30:21.548]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.548 --> 00:30:23.749]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.749 --> 00:30:25.089]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:26.390]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:31.876]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.876 --> 00:30:35.461]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.461 --> 00:30:39.285]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.285 --> 00:30:40.526]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:41.428]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.428 --> 00:30:42.529]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:43.450]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.271]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:47.594]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.594 --> 00:30:50.436]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:51.197]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:04.822 --> 00:31:06.083]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.083 --> 00:31:10.025]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:10.025 --> 00:31:12.246]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.246 --> 00:31:18.128]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:31:18.128 --> 00:31:24.351]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:30.754]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.754 --> 00:31:34.936]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.936 --> 00:31:39.218]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:39.218 --> 00:31:45.181]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:45.181 --> 00:31:48.102]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.723 --> 00:31:50.707]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.707 --> 00:31:51.829]  It's here.
[00:31:51.829 --> 00:31:58.243]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.791]  The mighty Roman soldier was given a daily ration of fermented fish oil.
[00:32:03.791 --> 00:32:09.073]  The stoic Scandinavian Viking had a drum of fermenting cod livers outside the door of his home.
[00:32:09.073 --> 00:32:12.315]  And Grandma always had cod liver oil in the cupboard.
[00:32:12.315 --> 00:32:23.599]  Today, Green Pasture Products, a family-owned business, provides high-quality, nutrient-dense cod and other fish liver oils made in the same way they've been made throughout history prior to 1850, through fermentation.
[00:32:23.599 --> 00:32:29.161]  Cold-fermented cod liver oil from Green Pasture is rich in vitamins A, D, E, K, omega-3,
[00:32:29.761 --> 00:32:30.181]  I think so.
[00:33:03.527 --> 00:33:18.551]  Come, you masters of war Here to build the big guns Here to build the death planes Here to build all the bombs
[00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:23.730]  We are back!
[00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:24.571]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.571 --> 00:33:26.473]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.473 --> 00:33:28.856]  We are joined by Mark Dice.
[00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:35.423]  Coming up in this segment, we are going to play a call to action and a little sneak peek of Invisible Empire, a new one.
[00:33:35.423 --> 00:33:36.063]  You haven't seen this one.
[00:33:36.063 --> 00:33:37.004]  We put it up on the website.
[00:33:37.004 --> 00:33:39.928]  All these things are over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:33:42.984 --> 00:33:57.547]  And I want to talk about this call to action, because without you guys out there, without the listeners, without the viewers, without people burning these discs and getting them out to their friends, their family members, and complete strangers, yes I said complete strangers, we don't have an impact.
[00:33:57.547 --> 00:34:07.488]  That's why Loose Change was so huge, because people saw a resonance in a message, copied the discs, handed them out in masses, really got the word out.
[00:34:07.488 --> 00:34:10.029]  And we need that again, and I'm not trying to brag here,
[00:34:10.549 --> 00:34:22.155]  But back in 2002, when I first woke up to this stuff, and there wasn't a PrisonPlanet.tv where I could just download all of Alex Jones' films, I was actually making my own discs.
[00:34:22.155 --> 00:34:24.136]  This was before DVD-Rs were out there.
[00:34:24.136 --> 00:34:24.896]  I was burning CD-Rs
[00:34:26.257 --> 00:34:33.862]  From FileShare, I was using like Morpheus and Kazaa, all the predecessors to LimeWire basically.
[00:34:33.862 --> 00:34:40.947]  Nutella, I was on all these little networks and I was getting the Alex Jones films and I was getting raw video from 9-11 and I was creating folders.
[00:34:40.947 --> 00:34:42.728]  This is before I was a filmmaker.
[00:34:42.728 --> 00:34:43.089]  2002!
[00:34:43.089 --> 00:34:50.814]  And I was burning CD after CD of things like Masters of Terror, Matrix of Evil in 2004 when that came out.
[00:34:50.814 --> 00:34:52.655]  I might have even been 2003.
[00:34:52.655 --> 00:34:54.717]  And getting the word out saying, hey, check this out.
[00:34:55.037 --> 00:35:03.585]  Now a lot of people would just throw the disc away, but some people would watch one or two of the things and then they'd watch the rest and say, wow, this is some pretty interesting stuff, but is it all true?
[00:35:03.585 --> 00:35:17.257]  And now I can put together a package, a two hour and 12 minute movie that if you have no idea what global governance is, what a one world order might look like, you can have that information in a couple of hours.
[00:35:17.257 --> 00:35:19.219]  And with you, the listeners out there handing them out,
[00:35:20.345 --> 00:35:22.646]  It can have just such an impact.
[00:35:22.646 --> 00:35:28.627]  Mark, you yourself went through colleges and raided classrooms handing out loose change.
[00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:42.350]  Yeah, and even before that, I was downloading films off of FairShare, Alex Jones' films too, and just saving them as Windows media files, and I was giving them out to people and friends and former teachers of mine.
[00:35:43.470 --> 00:36:01.535]  Yeah, I just got so angry and I realized that this information is so powerful and so important and it needed to pierce the mainstream and that's what I've tried to do with calling into these mainstream shows, weaseling my way into the gossip columns, the celebrity gossip columns.
[00:36:02.173 --> 00:36:08.677]  Criticizing celebrities in a relevant way and then pointing people down the path they can find a bigger, bigger picture.
[00:36:08.677 --> 00:36:12.460]  And we need to continue that because people now are looking for answers.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.961]  Like I said before, a lot of people didn't care about the war.
[00:36:14.961 --> 00:36:16.562]  They didn't think it affected them.
[00:36:16.562 --> 00:36:18.263]  People weren't involved in politics.
[00:36:18.263 --> 00:36:19.644]  They just didn't care.
[00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:25.548]  But now that their pocketbook is hurt, now that they're scared that they're going to lose their job, maybe they've taken a pay cut.
[00:36:25.548 --> 00:36:28.970]  Maybe they've had their cut back from full-time to part-time.
[00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.431]  Maybe they've lost their 401k match.
[00:36:32.053 --> 00:36:35.340]  They have friends and families that could be losing their homes.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.804]  People now are looking for answers.
[00:36:36.804 --> 00:36:39.129]  So this is the perfect time to give them those answers.
[00:36:40.234 --> 00:36:49.603]  Absolutely, and saying that, we are now going to play this call to action by Alex Jones for my new film, Invisible Empire, A New World, Order Defined.
[00:36:49.603 --> 00:36:52.886]  It comes out April 15th, probably going to ship a little bit early.
[00:36:52.886 --> 00:36:53.807]  It's looking good, folks.
[00:36:53.807 --> 00:37:00.113]  We might have those DVDs in on Monday or Tuesday, so who knows, you might even get them on the 14th before tax day.
[00:37:00.113 --> 00:37:02.635]  It's Invisible Empire, A New World, Order Defined.
[00:37:02.635 --> 00:37:03.856]  Pre-order it today.
[00:37:03.856 --> 00:37:04.217]  Here we go.
[00:37:06.884 --> 00:37:09.965]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:37:09.965 --> 00:37:13.186]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:37:13.186 --> 00:37:18.288]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:37:18.288 --> 00:37:22.809]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:37:22.809 --> 00:37:25.270]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.691]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:37:27.691 --> 00:37:30.952]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:37:30.952 --> 00:37:32.292]  Invisible Empire chronicles
[00:37:33.853 --> 00:37:44.261]  I believe first of all that we need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:46.583]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:37:46.583 --> 00:37:50.626]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:37:50.626 --> 00:37:53.168]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[00:38:02.934 --> 00:38:12.381]  If you look at the membership lists of the Bohemian Grove and the Council of Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, a lot of the key level people are over there.
[00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:17.470]  I don't know.
[00:38:34.716 --> 00:38:38.999]  Aware of the New World Order, aware of the eugenicists, and you understand their game plan.
[00:38:38.999 --> 00:38:41.500]  But the general public is not aware.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.421]  They know something is wrong in the world.
[00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:44.422]  They're ready to listen.
[00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:46.583]  There is an awakening happening.
[00:38:46.583 --> 00:38:49.445]  And this film will accelerate that awakening.
[00:38:49.445 --> 00:38:54.208]  The Pentagon has said that 90% of the war is information.
[00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:55.469]  We understand that.
[00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:58.490]  We have the truth, the globalists have the lies.
[00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:04.014]  We go past the puppets directly to the true power structure of this planet.
[00:39:04.654 --> 00:39:14.801]  What makes them tick, what their goals are, how they control societies, how they use round table groups, front groups to control government, how they ship in narcotics.
[00:39:14.801 --> 00:39:23.488]  We've had a criminal corporate takeover of the United States and every other major industrialized country on the planet.
[00:39:23.488 --> 00:39:32.034]  The globalists in their own words, calling for a planetary tyranny, how they control governments through continuity of government, through emergency dictatorship.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.684]  I want to thank all of our supporters who over the years have made everything we do here possible.
[00:39:37.684 --> 00:39:41.867]  We have had a giant effect globally and much of that credit goes to you out there.
[00:39:41.867 --> 00:39:46.631]  So I want to thank my supporters in advance who are going to get this film and get it out to everyone.
[00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:49.594]  The power to bring down the New World Order is in your hands.
[00:39:50.234 --> 00:39:54.176]  And a key weapon in this fight is Invisible Empire.
[00:39:54.176 --> 00:40:10.922]  Invisible Empire is perfect, not just to make copies on DVD and give to your friends and family, but to have viewing parties and screenings, to make this an event in your business, your household, your church, so that people understand exactly what's happening in our world.
[00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:17.264]  It is up to us who understand what's happening with the New World Order to get out there and to warn everyone we know.
[00:40:17.264 --> 00:40:18.605]  The ball is in your court.
[00:40:19.625 --> 00:40:28.013]  If the population is conscious of how the globalists are controlling society and what their endgame is, we can bring them down.
[00:40:28.013 --> 00:40:32.958]  You can go to Infowars.com and purchase Invisible Empire today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:32.958 --> 00:40:35.160]  It premieres the 15th of April.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:36.220]  We're good to go!
[00:40:56.155 --> 00:41:01.217]  Get DVD burners to buy blank DVDs and to make as many copies as possible.
[00:41:01.217 --> 00:41:08.940]  We're going to have a DivX version and other versions for download at PrisonPlanet.tv for members so you can burn it to disk and give it to everyone you know.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.561]  The people are ready to hear the truth.
[00:41:10.561 --> 00:41:12.222]  They're ready to be fully awakened.
[00:41:12.222 --> 00:41:13.082]  They're ready to learn.
[00:41:13.502 --> 00:41:15.164]  Who their enemy is.
[00:41:15.164 --> 00:41:19.127]  An invisible empire, a new order to find, does just that.
[00:41:19.127 --> 00:41:21.790]  It's available on DVD at infowars.com.
[00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.592]  Or again, go to prisonplanet.tv and sign up.
[00:41:24.592 --> 00:41:27.435]  You can also share your passcode with as many as five other people.
[00:41:27.435 --> 00:41:29.177]  It's coming out April 15th.
[00:41:29.177 --> 00:41:32.440]  You can also call toll free to order the DVD of this film.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:32.480]  888-253-3139.
[00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:44.294]  And Mark, I believe in this country.
[00:41:44.294 --> 00:41:56.430]  I believe in humanity in general and I know that there are a lot of well-meaning ignorant people out there that believe in climate change that don't understand that it's really about not only a
[00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:06.632]  Global government folks, but about population control, about population reduction, about getting into every facet of your life, and this film exposes that amongst other things.
[00:42:06.632 --> 00:42:11.173]  A lot of people are just misguided of what their modes of control are.
[00:42:11.173 --> 00:42:15.074]  If they can't get you with the war, they're gonna try to get you with the environment.
[00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:20.755]  That's what this false left-right paradigm is, and that's why it's so crucial to break that paradigm, Mark.
[00:42:21.618 --> 00:42:29.861]  Yes, and I myself, it's embarrassing for me to admit this, but at the onset of the war in Iraq, I still was not awakened to 9-11.
[00:42:29.861 --> 00:42:33.782]  I was still not awakened to the false flag terrorism.
[00:42:33.782 --> 00:42:36.023]  I was just a typical college kid.
[00:42:36.023 --> 00:42:43.665]  And I remember on my college campus, there were some people protesting the onset of the war, right before Operation Shock and Awe.
[00:42:43.665 --> 00:42:47.366]  And they had a microphone, and people could get up there and say their piece about why we should do this.
[00:42:47.366 --> 00:42:50.047]  And I ran up there, and I grabbed the microphone, and I said,
[00:42:50.515 --> 00:42:57.598]  You know, you people don't know what's going on after you spend most of your time watching, you know, MTV and reading Us Weekly.
[00:42:57.598 --> 00:43:01.139]  So you need to just, you know, trust our leaders, and they know.
[00:43:01.139 --> 00:43:03.720]  They have more information and more knowledge than you do.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.362]  So if they want to go to war, I'm sure that there's a good reason.
[00:43:07.362 --> 00:43:08.742]  And, you know, there was a good reason.
[00:43:08.742 --> 00:43:11.503]  It was just not the reason that I had thought at that time.
[00:43:11.503 --> 00:43:14.384]  And, you know, I had well-meaning intentions.
[00:43:14.384 --> 00:43:16.185]  I was, you know, using my
[00:43:17.154 --> 00:43:24.298]  Extreme extroverted self to go up there and do what I thought needed to be done to put these people down.
[00:43:24.298 --> 00:43:30.762]  And I'm very embarrassed about that now, because now that I realize the bigger picture, I see the error of my ways.
[00:43:30.762 --> 00:43:45.710]  And so I'm sure there's a lot of other people out there that are like me, like you, that are really passionate and want to do good, and think that Sean Hannity's a great American, and we need to help wake those people up and get them on our side.
[00:43:46.483 --> 00:43:50.086]  And it might be a slow process, but I think, look at how far we've come now.
[00:43:50.086 --> 00:43:53.468]  I mean, I was downloading films off of Bear Share and streaming them.
[00:43:53.468 --> 00:44:02.755]  This is before YouTube, and it's so much easier now that we can grab somebody's attention so much faster than we did even just four years ago.
[00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.695]  And that's why they're going after the internet.
[00:44:05.695 --> 00:44:09.417]  They do realize that the internet does pose a great threat to them.
[00:44:09.417 --> 00:44:29.926]  Not just Wikileaks, not just Kryptome, but really Google Video was shut down because of the success of Loose Change Final Cut and then it started happening with Terror Storm and Endgame and even films like Zeitgeist got too big for their britches and they had to literally shut that down and put you in this new YouTube paradigm with the two companies
[00:44:30.386 --> 00:44:33.148]  You can't even upload anything to Google Video.
[00:44:33.148 --> 00:44:35.490]  Folks, I uploaded my last movie to Google Video.
[00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.152]  I couldn't get any stats on it.
[00:44:37.152 --> 00:44:40.594]  I was number two in the world within 24 hours of the release.
[00:44:40.594 --> 00:44:49.141]  I was number one in the world within 48 hours of release, and then I just disappeared from the page for an entire week, Mark, where I couldn't even find myself in the top 1,000.
[00:44:49.141 --> 00:44:55.826]  No, and the Big Brother Grid I see is a part of the film, and it's incredible.
[00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:56.447]  People think that
[00:44:57.085 --> 00:44:57.605]  That's right.
[00:45:15.447 --> 00:45:24.510]  may use terminology from George Orwell's 1984 novel, such as Memory Hole, Big Brother, Orwellian, Thought Police.
[00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.892]  All of these terms were actually coined by George Orwell in his novel that was published in 1949.
[00:45:29.892 --> 00:45:38.975]  And it's so crazy because he so accurately predicted, it's almost prosthetic, what his book is done.
[00:45:38.975 --> 00:45:43.017]  I mean, here's a description of him talking about telescreen
[00:45:43.655 --> 00:45:45.216]  A lot of people may be familiar with this.
[00:45:45.216 --> 00:45:47.357]  A lot of audience members may or may not.
[00:45:47.357 --> 00:45:51.619]  Which are the screens that he wrote about that watched and listened everybody into society.
[00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:54.320]  And this is what he wrote in 1949.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.682]  Quote, the telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.
[00:45:57.682 --> 00:46:02.164]  Any sound that went and made above the level of a low whisper would be picked up by it.
[00:46:02.164 --> 00:46:09.387]  Moreover, so as long as he remained within the field of vision of the metal plaque, he could be seen as well as heard.
[00:46:09.387 --> 00:46:10.628]  He had to live.
[00:46:10.628 --> 00:46:11.188]  Did live.
[00:46:11.621 --> 00:46:11.741]  I'm
[00:46:29.617 --> 00:46:30.138]  School bathrooms.
[00:46:30.138 --> 00:46:32.900]  They're putting cameras in private citizens homes.
[00:46:47.995 --> 00:46:54.276]  And that was over a year ago, and they said within the next 24 months, they were going to try to make it 20,000 homes.
[00:46:54.276 --> 00:47:04.179]  And of course, they always pick the dregs of society, the people that they've CPSed their kids, or have been in and out of Family Court, the ones that are taking social services over there.
[00:47:04.179 --> 00:47:06.719]  But it starts with them, and it goes to everybody else.
[00:47:06.719 --> 00:47:12.241]  And I don't care how bad it is, we shouldn't have CCTV cameras that are manned 24-7
[00:47:13.821 --> 00:47:14.562]  In our homes.
[00:47:14.562 --> 00:47:16.003]  It wouldn't matter if they weren't, man.
[00:47:16.003 --> 00:47:21.327]  But they realize they don't have enough infrastructure, enough personnel to have them watch those cameras.
[00:47:21.327 --> 00:47:26.590]  So what we also cover in the movie is the fact that you can now watch from your computer.
[00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.812]  You don't have to be a law enforcement officer.
[00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:37.138]  No, you can be just a random person who gets cash prizes for turning in criminals from watching random CCTV cameras, Mark.
[00:47:38.263 --> 00:47:47.787]  And these CCTV cameras, as of last year, in London, I don't know how many, but they've implemented a program called ISIS.
[00:47:47.787 --> 00:47:51.028]  It stands for Integrated Sensor Information System.
[00:47:51.028 --> 00:47:56.690]  Now ISIS is the Egyptian goddess and mother of the sun god, Horus.
[00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:58.711]  And these are pre-crime cameras.
[00:47:58.711 --> 00:48:00.812]  They have created a software system
[00:48:01.505 --> 00:48:14.989]  ...that looks at groups of people and allegedly can determine whether they're getting hostile or whether they're participating in suspicious behavior.
[00:48:14.989 --> 00:48:26.953]  And I mean, one of the officials said, quote, when a crime looks like it's going to occur, the system will verbally warn the perpetrator and, if necessary, alert the nearest police office.
[00:48:28.132 --> 00:48:32.075]  And this is, this is what's happening, and this is only, this is last year!
[00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:36.259]  And just imagine what's going to happen in the next few years when these systems come on.
[00:48:36.259 --> 00:48:46.267]  Holland has a system that can record and listen to conversations from up to 100 yards away, using an echelon type of keyword system.
[00:48:46.267 --> 00:48:53.313]  So if somebody's on the streets and they're talking about a particular issue, they're talking about the New World Order, and they happen to mention several keywords,
[00:48:53.971 --> 00:49:07.862]  If this system can't detect it now, if the next generation system will, just imagine being hanging out on the street with your friends and just talking about a political issue, and several keywords come up in the conversation.
[00:49:07.862 --> 00:49:16.629]  And this system can detect that, and all of a sudden it's going to start looking at you closer, it's going to take your picture, put you into a database.
[00:49:16.629 --> 00:49:20.312]  This is the New World Order, and this is right around the corner.
[00:49:20.871 --> 00:49:22.752]  It's not only around the corner, it's here.
[00:49:22.752 --> 00:49:28.874]  And I want to talk about how they talk to you, how they talk to the populace, the general public out there.
[00:49:28.874 --> 00:49:32.295]  They say cash prizes as if it's a game show.
[00:49:32.295 --> 00:49:37.016]  They want you to associate those endorphins with that game show, that winning mentality.
[00:49:37.016 --> 00:49:42.598]  And of course, money makes us feel good, so it's a cash prize when you turn in your neighbor.
[00:49:42.598 --> 00:49:43.799]  But it's not really your neighbor.
[00:49:43.799 --> 00:49:48.640]  They're on the other side of town, or they're in a different county, or they're, you know, 200 miles away.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.161]  But what they want to create and
[00:49:50.641 --> 00:50:02.312]  Super create because Hitler created this type of a society where Stasi forces tattletale on one another and you don't know who the government informant is because you all become the government informants.
[00:50:02.312 --> 00:50:05.836]  Your 12-year-old is going to be sitting on these computers instead of an allowance.
[00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:12.342]  He's going to be like, oh, I can make 20 or 30 or maybe 200 or $300 if I man the cameras for a few days.
[00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.463]  It's insane to me, Mark.
[00:50:14.482 --> 00:50:21.965]  There was a presentation, you can probably find this on the internet, by a man named Jesse Schell, who used to work as a creative director for Disney.
[00:50:23.197 --> 00:50:26.659]  Uh, and this was at the 2010, uh, they call it the D.I.C.E.
[00:50:26.659 --> 00:50:26.959]  Summit.
[00:50:26.959 --> 00:50:31.441]  It's the Design, Initiative, Communication, Entertain, uh, Summit.
[00:50:31.441 --> 00:50:36.484]  It's the Summit of Video Game Executives, and he's talking about the future of video games.
[00:50:36.484 --> 00:50:43.587]  Hold right there, because we also go into the future of video gaming and how they want to microchip you in the future with these systems.
[00:50:43.587 --> 00:50:44.748]  I'm not making it up.
[00:50:44.748 --> 00:50:49.070]  That's a step beyond Project Natal, which is coming out at the Alex Jones Show, back after this.
[00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.671]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:01.093 --> 00:51:01.674]  Fact.
[00:51:01.674 --> 00:51:03.036]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:51:03.036 --> 00:51:05.159]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:51:05.159 --> 00:51:05.679]  Fact.
[00:51:05.679 --> 00:51:09.364]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:51:09.364 --> 00:51:09.985]  Fact.
[00:51:09.985 --> 00:51:15.492]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:51:15.492 --> 00:51:15.773]  Fact.
[00:51:16.033 --> 00:51:16.393]  We're good.
[00:51:33.431 --> 00:51:44.059]  It is the only herbal liver supplement that is backed by over 190 published clinical trials and endorsed by a quarter of a million healthcare professionals in 76 countries worldwide.
[00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:45.700]  Don't wait to protect your liver.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.681]  Visit us at ResearchedHerbs.com or call 1-800-973-1486.
[00:51:47.681 --> 00:51:48.902]  That's 1-800-973-1486 or go to ResearchedHerbs.com.
[00:51:48.902 --> 00:51:50.103]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:03.093]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.093 --> 00:52:05.356]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.356 --> 00:52:08.699]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.699 --> 00:52:13.804]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.804 --> 00:52:17.988]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.308 --> 00:52:20.769]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.769 --> 00:52:23.190]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:26.452]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.452 --> 00:52:34.055]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.395 --> 00:52:39.777]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.777 --> 00:52:42.638]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.638 --> 00:52:46.320]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.400]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.741]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.741 --> 00:52:50.221]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.952 --> 00:53:03.495]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:53:03.495 --> 00:53:05.797]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:53:05.797 --> 00:53:06.657]  Don't!
[00:53:06.657 --> 00:53:10.100]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:17.246]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:53:17.226 --> 00:53:19.187]  's number one debt secret.
[00:53:19.187 --> 00:53:23.291]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:26.413]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:53:26.413 --> 00:53:27.014]  Here's Herb K.
[00:53:29.957 --> 00:53:33.780]  I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:34.420]  Herb K. was right.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:38.183]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:53:38.183 --> 00:53:39.583]  What have you got to lose?
[00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:40.864]  Stop the calls now.
[00:53:40.864 --> 00:53:42.886]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:43.586]  Get Herb K.'
[00:53:43.566 --> 00:53:46.428]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:53:46.428 --> 00:53:46.788]  Call 800-822-1291.
[00:53:46.788 --> 00:53:47.329]  That's 800-822-1291.
[00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.369]  800-822-1291.
[00:54:10.077 --> 00:54:17.604]  This is a big shot that used to work for Disney and now has its own video game company and at this technology summit he was talking about the future of video games.
[00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:55.325]  And he was basically saying, he says, quote, you have no idea what books your grandparents read or where they went on a daily basis, but these censors, he was talking about censors that are going to be everywhere, that are going to be on us and all around us everywhere, I'm quoting him here, to be tracking and watching what we're doing forever.
[00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:58.928]  And he says, our grandchildren will know every book we've read.
[00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:02.231]  And then he goes on to say that they'll know what we did on a daily basis.
[00:55:02.231 --> 00:55:04.413]  And he concluded his speech by saying that
[00:55:05.137 --> 00:55:05.337]  Oh yes.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:30.341]  Oh yes, Big Brother needs to judge us in order for humanity to evolve, Mark.
[00:55:30.341 --> 00:55:31.401]  That's the big sell.
[00:55:31.401 --> 00:55:33.222]  No, it's for our own good.
[00:55:33.222 --> 00:55:35.262]  We're not evolved enough right now.
[00:55:35.262 --> 00:55:38.382]  We need to be watched so we make better moral decisions.
[00:55:38.382 --> 00:55:42.403]  Why don't we just make better moral decisions on our own?
[00:55:42.403 --> 00:55:52.965]  Why don't we just find a moral compass again, love thy neighbor, work with one another, work against the tyrants that keep taking more and more, and in their own documents they admit it.
[00:55:52.965 --> 00:55:53.285]  I don't know if
[00:55:53.285 --> 00:55:53.465]  If you're
[00:56:13.123 --> 00:56:19.445]  You know, the futurist Ray Kurzweil has written some pretty incredible books about the future of technology, the age of intelligent machines, the age of spiritual machines.
[00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:58.523]  He actually admits in one of his books that in the future, I think he predicts by about 2029, that there's going to be a tremendous gap between, because of technology, between those who are just completely politically disconnected, socially disconnected, and he kind of dances around the fact that there is going to be a technocracy elite.
[00:56:59.144 --> 00:57:11.467]  That have access to all of this technology that use the technology and then there's the slaves that really have nothing and are kind of just left, you know, running on the treadmill, slaving to the man, as I like to say.
[00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:15.012]  But I even think that's a soft term, a technocracy.
[00:57:15.012 --> 00:57:18.053]  That implies as though the people have some say in this.
[00:57:18.053 --> 00:57:26.916]  No, we live in a technopoly now run by the military-industrial complex that really started to gain momentum in the 30s, 40s, 50s.
[00:57:26.916 --> 00:57:31.478]  And by the 60s, Eisenhower had identified it and warned us against it.
[00:57:31.478 --> 00:57:34.079]  Again, that is featured in my new film, Invisible Empire.
[00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:35.059]  We really go over
[00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:36.800]  No, that's part of the plan.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.880]  And it gets so creepy.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:42.062]  I mean, some people can't even grasp what it is that's happening and what's coming around the corner.
[00:57:42.062 --> 00:57:43.223]  I have dug up actual patents.
[00:58:05.257 --> 00:58:10.500]  Of subliminal messaging devices that have been patented for 20 years.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:26.168]  Back in the late 70s, the Wall Street Journal and Time Magazine did articles on shopping malls that were implanting subliminal messages in the music system to try to get people to not shoplift and apparently they had success.
[00:58:26.168 --> 00:58:32.592]  There's one patent here that I have, the file of 1989, that can submit subliminal messages
[00:58:34.356 --> 00:58:37.707]  Mark, people don't understand the amount of control they're really under.
[00:58:37.707 --> 00:58:38.569]  I thank you for joining us.
[00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:40.094]  It's the Alex Jones Show, back after this.
[00:58:40.911 --> 00:58:46.616]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.616 --> 00:58:50.359]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.359 --> 00:58:51.660]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:57.245]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:57.245 --> 00:59:02.269]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:02.269 --> 00:59:02.750]  It's true.
[00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:05.552]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:59:05.552 --> 00:59:07.314]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:07.834 --> 00:59:13.058]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:13.058 --> 00:59:15.379]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:15.379 --> 00:59:20.162]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:20.162 --> 00:59:21.283]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:21.283 --> 00:59:24.345]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:24.345 --> 00:59:27.988]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:27.988 --> 00:59:31.170]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:33.391]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:33.391 --> 00:59:34.332]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:38.034 --> 00:59:40.916]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:40.916 --> 00:59:47.020]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:53.424]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseabank.com.
[00:59:53.424 --> 00:59:55.806]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.806 --> 01:00:05.091]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:05.692]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.163]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.163 --> 01:00:09.945]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.945 --> 01:00:11.527]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.527 --> 01:00:13.069]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:17.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.255 --> 01:00:21.321]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.706]  A power-packed program today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:27.067]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.067 --> 01:00:28.187]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:28.187 --> 01:00:37.090]  We just had Mark Dice, the author of New World Order Facts and Fiction on, and now we are joined by Bob Chapman of the internationalforecaster.com.
[01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:39.291]  And I want to talk about the economy.
[01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:50.934]  I want to talk about Bernanke openly saying they're not only going to raise taxes, but take away, quote unquote, entitlement programs that people have bought into for years and years and years.
[01:00:50.934 --> 01:00:52.995]  We're talking decades upon decades.
[01:00:52.995 --> 01:00:56.396]  And now they're saying, no, you're not going to get your Social Security.
[01:00:56.396 --> 01:00:59.137]  No, you're not going to get your Medicare.
[01:00:59.137 --> 01:01:01.218]  And they're going to take it away incrementally.
[01:01:01.218 --> 01:01:04.919]  Bob, I want to get your take on this quote from Bernanke yesterday.
[01:01:05.399 --> 01:01:25.727]  To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes, modifications of entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, and we all know their defense budget will never really go down, they'll just use black ops, or some combination of the above.
[01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:27.787]  Bob Chapman.
[01:01:27.787 --> 01:01:32.209]  Well, I think they're planning another war, and so that's gonna cost us another
[01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:37.869]  It'll probably be a world war, so it'll probably cost us about five trillion.
[01:01:37.869 --> 01:01:42.292]  And so they don't want to talk about that, but they've got that in the cards.
[01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:53.378]  And that's how, you know, I project ahead what they're going to do, and that's how I was able to make the call on 9-11 and in Iraq and Afghanistan, because these are diversions.
[01:01:53.378 --> 01:02:01.083]  So in the context of budget, what he said was meaningless, other than the fact that we're going to take you from
[01:02:03.314 --> 01:02:11.558]  A recession and then into a depression and then we're going to bring you deeply into poverty.
[01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:13.139]  That's really what it's all about.
[01:02:13.139 --> 01:02:17.801]  And they were even talking about a VAT, a value added tax.
[01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:25.185]  And because it's so complex, you're talking about it being a minimum of 10% tax because that 10% will go to
[01:02:28.772 --> 01:02:35.454]  The monitoring and operation of the tax itself.
[01:02:35.454 --> 01:02:42.636]  So that's why VATs usually run somewhere between 17 and 21 percent.
[01:02:42.636 --> 01:02:46.057]  And we'll say the average is 18 and a half.
[01:02:46.057 --> 01:02:55.540]  And so about eight and a half percent goes in to defray other costs and the remainder goes for administration, so to speak.
[01:02:56.167 --> 01:03:00.608]  And so the talkie, Al Fokker, was the one that brought that up again the other day.
[01:03:00.608 --> 01:03:02.288]  Others have brought it up as well.
[01:03:02.288 --> 01:03:04.069]  But there's no question.
[01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:11.730]  But to fully answer this question, I'll reiterate something I've said on Alex's show before, several times.
[01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:25.093]  And that is, I'm expecting next year that these countries that have these sovereign debt problems, and there's 19 of them, and by mid-next year there'll be more of them,
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:41.109]  And they're going to have a meeting, and they're going to devalue worldwide currencies simultaneously, and they are going to settle a debt default among nations.
[01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:51.275]  And this could be the crisis that they're looking for to bring in their world financial constitution, as Gordon Brown mused in late February of this year.
[01:03:51.275 --> 01:03:54.757]  That's right, and I just got off a program
[01:03:55.416 --> 01:03:58.559]  Which, Alex is the only other American that's been on there.
[01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:10.631]  There's the international radio out of Athens, which is carried by BBC and Deutsche Welle, and the French International Network.
[01:04:10.631 --> 01:04:15.295]  And, you know, Helen Scopus said to me, well, why are they doing this?
[01:04:15.295 --> 01:04:16.737]  Why is this happening?
[01:04:16.737 --> 01:04:18.338]  I said, ask your Prime Minister.
[01:04:18.338 --> 01:04:19.820]  He's a member of the Bilderberger Group.
[01:04:20.618 --> 01:04:26.961]  And it'll be interesting to see if that's edited out of the tape or not when it goes on the air.
[01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:29.522]  But the point is this.
[01:04:29.522 --> 01:04:32.783]  That's why Grease was used as a poster child.
[01:04:34.175 --> 01:04:36.116]  Well, let's come back to that on the other side.
[01:04:36.116 --> 01:04:40.957]  Then I also want you to break down what exactly is a value-added tax?
[01:04:40.957 --> 01:04:42.617]  Who's going to be paying it?
[01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:44.338]  How are they going to implement it?
[01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:47.899]  And how gradually will it be increased, just like every other tax we have?
[01:04:47.899 --> 01:04:48.819]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:48.819 --> 01:04:51.920]  We're streaming live over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:02.281 --> 01:05:06.242]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.242 --> 01:05:15.105]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.105 --> 01:05:19.746]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.746 --> 01:05:30.569]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.189 --> 01:05:40.712]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.712 --> 01:05:46.134]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.134 --> 01:05:53.617]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:56.378]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:05.712]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:09.655]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.655 --> 01:06:11.877]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:11.877 --> 01:06:17.763]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.763 --> 01:06:23.989]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.409 --> 01:06:30.394]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.394 --> 01:06:34.577]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.577 --> 01:06:38.860]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:44.804]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:44.804 --> 01:06:48.367]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.367 --> 01:06:50.348]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.348 --> 01:06:50.769]  It's here.

[01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:54.172]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:54.172 --> 01:07:56.134]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.053 --> 01:08:10.494]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:10.494 --> 01:08:11.654]  I am Jason Berman sitting in.
[01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:14.016]  We're joined by Bob Chapman.
[01:08:14.016 --> 01:08:19.639]  And Bob, I want you to go over why Greece is the model for the global economic collapse.
[01:08:19.639 --> 01:08:28.203]  And then coming up at the 30 aftermark, I'm actually going to play Gordon Brown announcing the need for a global constitution.
[01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:34.106]  And this is a man who has called for a new world order literally dozens upon dozens of times.
[01:08:34.106 --> 01:08:35.787]  So Bob, why is Greece the model?
[01:08:37.718 --> 01:08:39.720]  Because they're very vulnerable.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.164]  They should have never gone into the Eurozone in the first place, because they didn't qualify.
[01:08:44.164 --> 01:08:49.328]  Goldman Sachs come in and Mickey Mouse their books for them, and now they're paying for it.
[01:08:49.328 --> 01:08:52.891]  And they did the same thing for Italy as well.
[01:08:52.891 --> 01:08:58.556]  Italy should have never been accepted because they didn't qualify either under the Maastricht guidelines.
[01:08:58.556 --> 01:09:00.878]  And so, where they're headed with this,
[01:09:02.051 --> 01:09:14.260]  And the only reason I think that they brought this up instead of covering up any kind of a problem that they had previously, is Papandreou is a Bilderberger, so he knows what's going on.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:23.847]  And so what they did is they decided that we're going to have inflation between now and sometime next year.
[01:09:23.847 --> 01:09:30.332]  And what they're going to do is they're going to bring all these nations together, they're going to devalue and default.
[01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:35.721]  And then they're going to have a deflationary depression, and they're going to take them all down together.
[01:09:35.721 --> 01:09:42.588]  There's 19 countries that are virtually bankrupt, and they're going to take them all down together at the same time.
[01:09:42.588 --> 01:09:45.712]  And by that time, there'll probably be more of them.
[01:09:45.712 --> 01:09:47.954]  And so Greece was chosen because it was easy.
[01:09:49.335 --> 01:10:17.078]  Now, you're saying you're going to see a domino effect, or you're saying right at the same time, as soon as one of these large nations economically collapses, is it going to be like a week-long period, a month-long period, or are we literally going to see an economic collapse happen before our eyes in days, and then them either magically have one of these global summits on the horizon, it'll happen just before that, or they'll create a new global summit in which they have to bring in this global constitution?
[01:10:19.002 --> 01:10:24.666]  Either or, but I don't think they're going to bring the Constitution in quickly.
[01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:33.391]  They have to put the world into, well put them on their knees financially and economically.
[01:10:33.391 --> 01:10:43.037]  And then they will be, because they'll be wards of the state so to speak, because everything will be chaos financially and economically and we'll probably have another war going on at the same time.
[01:10:43.037 --> 01:10:46.919]  They'll say, oh gee, maybe six months down the line we have to have this.
[01:10:47.615 --> 01:10:50.076]  International World Constitution.
[01:10:50.076 --> 01:10:54.959]  And that's when they'll try to ram it in, but I think, you know, they're incrementalists.
[01:10:54.959 --> 01:11:15.468]  And what they'll do is they'll lead up, this one's got a problem, Latvia or Iceland or Poland, and you'll start reading about sovereign debt problems among 15 or 20 countries, including the United States, and all of a sudden, bingo, we've got to have that meeting, and then they'll have their meeting, and then we'll be in perpetual
[01:11:16.625 --> 01:11:19.307]  Depression for a long time.
[01:11:19.307 --> 01:11:23.209]  Now, you were talking about a value-added tax and how complex it was.
[01:11:23.209 --> 01:11:28.192]  Now, how would this be thrust upon the people and who would be paying it first?
[01:11:28.192 --> 01:11:34.376]  Well, a value-added tax is paid at all stages of services or production.
[01:11:34.376 --> 01:11:37.057]  And so, it's a multiple tax.
[01:11:37.057 --> 01:11:41.580]  It just isn't the 18.5% on average that I mentioned.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:45.022]  Within that, which the people pay at the counter, so to speak,
[01:11:45.655 --> 01:11:51.138]  Uh, when they buy, uh, an iron or an ironing board or something like that.
[01:11:51.138 --> 01:11:55.140]  Before that, they tax at each stage.
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:12:07.026]  In other words, when the, uh, steel or, or whatever the, uh, uh, the implement is made out of, uh, reaches the gate of the manufacturer, it's taxed.
[01:12:07.026 --> 01:12:13.549]  And then once it's processed and it's finished product, it's taxed.
[01:12:13.549 --> 01:12:14.390]  And then it goes to
[01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:17.492]  The middleman and it's taxed.
[01:12:17.492 --> 01:12:23.316]  And then it goes from the middleman to the retail counter and that's when you pay your 18.5%.
[01:12:23.316 --> 01:12:30.960]  So it really may not be 18.5% to the entire economy, it may be 23.5% or more.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:39.005]  And it may cause these production people to actually raise the prices so the people at the counter will be paying even more than an 18.5% tax increase.
[01:12:39.005 --> 01:12:44.188]  They'll be paying perhaps another 10 or 20% because of the cost to the producers and manufacturers.
[01:12:45.675 --> 01:12:47.575]  Very perceptive.
[01:12:47.575 --> 01:12:49.956]  And that's what happened in Europe.
[01:12:49.956 --> 01:13:03.459]  And also, right after, they set new guidelines to equalize all of the VATs that they had in different countries under the European Union.
[01:13:03.459 --> 01:13:06.260]  And once they did that, you had a jump in costs.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:10.641]  And that's why everything in Europe costs so much more today than it costs in the United States.
[01:13:11.716 --> 01:13:22.685]  In fact, at record highs today, it's $9 for a gallon of gas in, I believe it's in the United Kingdom, £6 if you will, which is $9 here.
[01:13:22.685 --> 01:13:23.866]  $9 for a gallon of gas.
[01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:34.495]  I gripe when it's above $3 or it's at $4.50 or almost $5 when I go to New York sometimes, but they're paying $9 a gallon in gas, Bob.
[01:13:34.495 --> 01:13:38.679]  Well, value-added tax at this stage of America's
[01:13:40.172 --> 01:13:45.596]  Um, problem development, we'll put it, is going to be disastrous.
[01:13:45.596 --> 01:13:49.019]  I mean, it'll be like financially imprisoning people.
[01:13:49.019 --> 01:13:57.125]  I mean, the whole setup in the United States will change, and it will become even more fascistic or socialistic, whichever you want to call it.
[01:13:57.125 --> 01:14:02.509]  And the government will have more and more control over people by using a VAT.
[01:14:03.786 --> 01:14:06.948]  Yeah, but Bob, the New York Times is telling me everything is okay.
[01:14:06.948 --> 01:14:08.689]  This is the headline of the New York Times.
[01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:09.829]  It's a joke, folks.
[01:14:09.829 --> 01:14:11.050]  Why so glum?
[01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:12.991]  Numbers point to a recovery.
[01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:17.333]  The American economy appears to be in a cyclical recovery that is gaining strength.
[01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:22.556]  Firms have begun to hire and consumer spending seems to be accelerating.
[01:14:22.556 --> 01:14:23.976]  Meanwhile, we have over 20% real
[01:14:25.217 --> 01:14:26.478]  Unemployment in this country.
[01:14:26.478 --> 01:14:36.047]  Bernanke is openly saying they're going to tax you even further, take away your Social Security and Medicare, and the bankers are also openly saying they're taking your pensions.
[01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:40.270]  But everything's okay, according to the New York Times, Bob.
[01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:44.814]  That's why the New York Times is about to go out of business.
[01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:45.895]  Well, I hope that's true.
[01:14:45.895 --> 01:14:48.478]  They're sick and tired of being lied to.
[01:14:48.478 --> 01:14:49.579]  It's as simple as that.
[01:14:49.579 --> 01:14:50.940]  I mean, this is why
[01:14:52.378 --> 01:14:58.843]  Alternative radio, as well as the internet, is so popular, particularly among younger people.
[01:14:58.843 --> 01:14:59.464]  Who's younger?
[01:14:59.464 --> 01:14:59.984]  People under 45.
[01:15:01.899 --> 01:15:05.161]  Well, I think it's also the fact that they can read through the propaganda.
[01:15:05.161 --> 01:15:18.169]  New York Times may not go out of business, but they have to find a way to pose people against one another instead of directing them towards the bankers, towards the elitists, towards the people that are really bringing this in.
[01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:19.430]  Let me give you an example.
[01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:21.712]  This one's out of the Associated Press yesterday.
[01:15:21.712 --> 01:15:25.514]  Nearly half of US households escape federal income tax.
[01:15:25.514 --> 01:15:28.236]  See, your neighbors aren't paying federal income tax.
[01:15:28.236 --> 01:15:29.357]  They're the enemy, Bob.
[01:15:29.357 --> 01:15:31.098]  They're the reason this country's going under.
[01:15:34.519 --> 01:15:38.600]  Let's start with the people who make lots of money, they don't pay any taxes.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.541]  Corporations pay very little.
[01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:44.823]  People are not paying taxes because they live next door, because they're unemployed.
[01:15:50.609 --> 01:15:52.110]  Well again, explain that to people.
[01:15:52.110 --> 01:16:01.778]  The big corporations out there, they're the ones that really don't pay the taxes and then in turn take our tax money through corporate welfare to insure their programs.
[01:16:01.778 --> 01:16:02.979]  They're government subsidized.
[01:16:04.867 --> 01:16:09.408]  And Bernanke's a good example with TARP and all of those other programs they had.
[01:16:09.408 --> 01:16:19.772]  They bailed out Wall Street banking, insurance companies, AIG, GE, GM, which we now own as taxpayers of the United States.
[01:16:19.772 --> 01:16:28.034]  And so, they're doing exactly what they want to do, and that is not to pay taxes.
[01:16:28.034 --> 01:16:33.816]  And one of the facets that almost everybody forgets is when these companies
[01:16:34.827 --> 01:16:36.828]  We'll take GE as an example.
[01:16:36.828 --> 01:16:39.469]  Do business all over the world.
[01:16:39.469 --> 01:16:51.295]  They have subsidiaries, and they funnel the profits into offshore subsidiary corporations set up in the Cayman Islands and places like that.
[01:16:51.295 --> 01:16:54.917]  Now, you and I can't do that, but the corporations can.
[01:16:54.917 --> 01:17:02.601]  And the last time they gave them an act of Congress that said, you international corporations
[01:17:03.553 --> 01:17:08.296]  They promised to create jobs, so we're going to let you bring back money.
[01:17:08.296 --> 01:17:14.820]  And they put back $350 billion into the United States, and only paid 5.25% tax.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.721]  It's almost five years ago now.
[01:17:16.721 --> 01:17:18.342]  They created no jobs.
[01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:21.083]  Regular taxation is 33%.
[01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:29.008]  Right now, there is approximately... Now let me put up the figures.
[01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:37.922]  About 1.3 trillion dollars sitting out there that they've never paid tax on and they're gonna pull the same thing again.
[01:17:37.922 --> 01:17:49.071]  And we allow them to get away with this and we don't shine the light on the real problem and the ignorant masses out there just buy into this propaganda and that's a huge part of the problem.
[01:17:49.071 --> 01:17:50.932]  They don't understand the real issues.
[01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.974]  They don't understand that their bank accounts have
[01:17:53.154 --> 01:17:53.815]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:17:53.815 --> 01:17:54.675]  It's called Minus Resources.
[01:18:21.235 --> 01:18:24.117]  You buy gold and silver coins, that's what you do.
[01:18:24.117 --> 01:18:32.301]  And incidentally, I talked to Ted earlier, and he told me to offer their French Franc for $249.68.
[01:18:32.301 --> 01:18:41.467]  And if you do that, you'll get a free one-year subscription to the International Forecaster, which is a dynamite deal.
[01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:43.608]  And he does pay for that, believe me.
[01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:44.829]  And that number to call is 800-686-8000.
[01:18:47.538 --> 01:18:49.241]  2237-800-686-2237.
[01:18:49.241 --> 01:18:54.569]  That is a super deal.
[01:18:54.569 --> 01:18:56.372]  But that's how you protect yourself.
[01:18:56.372 --> 01:18:58.635]  You buy gold and silver, and you put it away.
[01:18:59.898 --> 01:19:05.781]  Now Bob, on the other side of the next segment, I want to talk about you eluding us into another war.
[01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:07.382]  Are we going to be attacking Iran?
[01:19:07.382 --> 01:19:09.803]  If so, does that lead to a world war?
[01:19:09.803 --> 01:19:14.026]  What would World War III really look like in this time and age?
[01:19:14.026 --> 01:19:17.468]  I mean, would we have troops on the street here in the United States?
[01:19:18.268 --> 01:19:20.010]  Be fighting a war on the United States?
[01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:22.432]  Would it be looking more like a terrorist war?
[01:19:22.432 --> 01:19:26.576]  Would there be more false flags in this country to actually control the populace?
[01:19:26.576 --> 01:19:29.919]  Would we see a mandatory conscription?
[01:19:29.919 --> 01:19:31.000]  The bring back of the draft?
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.223]  I mean, what could... I can't fathom!
[01:19:33.763 --> 01:19:36.105]  What a world war would look like.
[01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:42.250]  I can see the wars that we have in the Middle East where we literally dominate these other nations for imperial power.
[01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:43.811]  But a world war?
[01:19:43.811 --> 01:19:45.072]  I don't know what that's going to look like.
[01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:46.333]  We'll be back after this.
[01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:47.294]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:47.294 --> 01:19:49.535]  I'm Jason Bermas with Bob Chapman.
[01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:50.516]  Infowars.com.
[01:19:50.516 --> 01:19:51.096]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:06.192]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:21:00.976 --> 01:21:03.937]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:21:03.937 --> 01:21:08.099]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:21:08.099 --> 01:21:10.360]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:15.522]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:21:15.522 --> 01:21:17.343]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:21:17.343 --> 01:21:18.884]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:21:18.884 --> 01:21:20.385]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:21:20.385 --> 01:21:23.426]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:29.112]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:21:29.112 --> 01:21:38.462]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[01:22:00.956 --> 01:22:02.117]  What's your home worth?
[01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:04.238]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:22:04.238 --> 01:22:07.261]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:22:07.261 --> 01:22:14.986]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:52.210]  MyPillow.
[01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:53.130]  For the rest of your life.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.861]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:10.861 --> 01:24:12.121]  I am Jason Verma sitting in.
[01:24:12.121 --> 01:24:14.242]  We're joined by Bob Chapman.
[01:24:14.242 --> 01:24:19.485]  And Bob, you were alluding to the fact that we may be put into another world war.
[01:24:19.485 --> 01:24:21.065]  How do you think that will be started?
[01:24:21.065 --> 01:24:22.426]  Will it be started through Iran?
[01:24:22.426 --> 01:24:23.526]  And then what does it look like?
[01:24:23.526 --> 01:24:29.509]  I mean, Obama and Medvedev just signed this new treaty, this new arms treaty.
[01:24:29.509 --> 01:24:31.490]  So a lot of people are saying it doesn't look like we're really
[01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:45.376]  In any danger of a hot war with Russia, however, I do see a real separation between Russia and the United States, at least in the currency trade with groups like BRIC trying to challenge the United States' power.
[01:24:45.376 --> 01:24:48.037]  That's Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and China.
[01:24:48.037 --> 01:24:54.740]  And even Medvedev himself showing a sample coin of this elusive global currency that the globalists seem to want to bring in.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.942]  How do we get involved in a world war?
[01:24:58.942 --> 01:25:01.303]  What side will we be on?
[01:25:01.303 --> 01:25:02.644]  Who will be our allies?
[01:25:02.644 --> 01:25:05.385]  Who will be our enemies?
[01:25:05.385 --> 01:25:09.088]  Well, I think the Britnations will be our enemies.
[01:25:09.088 --> 01:25:14.310]  And the reason why is that they have treaties with Iran.
[01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:17.172]  And Iran's the one that's going to be attacked.
[01:25:17.172 --> 01:25:20.394]  And it'll engulf the entire Middle East for openness, I think.
[01:25:22.279 --> 01:25:31.083]  The move by the President of the United States to have this non-nuclear treaty was just a paint in a different direction.
[01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:32.403]  I don't think it means anything.
[01:25:32.403 --> 01:25:34.024]  So it's all for show?
[01:25:34.024 --> 01:25:37.846]  They're talking about doing away with nuclear weapons, but I don't think they're going to do that.
[01:25:38.715 --> 01:25:39.355]  Well, obviously.
[01:25:39.355 --> 01:25:44.197]  I mean, they're saying that it wouldn't actually, it would be a 30% reduction, which is nothing.
[01:25:44.197 --> 01:25:46.038]  They could still destroy each other.
[01:25:46.038 --> 01:25:52.161]  But obviously, there's some kind of a geopolitical reason to do this, to put these people on stage together.
[01:25:52.161 --> 01:26:05.547]  But you do believe that if we do get involved in a world war, it probably will be sparked with some kind of a conflict in the Middle East, probably Iran, and then it will be the BRIC nations that we're fighting, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and China?
[01:26:05.547 --> 01:26:07.528]  Yeah, but it'll involve a lot more than that.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.543]  And it'll probably go on for a number of years.
[01:26:11.543 --> 01:26:13.945]  This is a method of distraction.
[01:26:13.945 --> 01:26:25.095]  When you're more worried about your children getting killed in warfare, you take your eye off the ball, and the ball happens to be the problem, economically and financially.
[01:26:25.095 --> 01:26:33.702]  It also will allow, and I lived through the Second World War, so I'm very well aware of it, it'll allow the government
[01:26:34.344 --> 01:26:38.925]  To be able to control people more easily.
[01:26:38.925 --> 01:26:42.746]  Like if they say that you can't go out on the street between 10 p.m.
[01:26:42.746 --> 01:26:45.386]  and 6 a.m., well you can't.
[01:26:45.386 --> 01:26:47.447]  And so on and so forth.
[01:26:47.447 --> 01:26:58.469]  So you're saying that they'll probably, even if there isn't a hot warfare that takes place in the United States or one of the surrounding regions, they'll impose curfews and further extend martial law in this country?
[01:26:58.469 --> 01:27:00.089]  Could very well be.
[01:27:00.089 --> 01:27:03.310]  And they would use homeland security, local law enforcement,
[01:27:04.102 --> 01:27:20.807]  And perhaps this new Hitler-Junger type organization that our president wants to put into operation, starting with 6,000, and I'm sure before you'll know it, it'll be 600,000 of these little goons running around the country.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:41.489]  Yeah, it really struck me very hard when I saw the promotion of social programs like City Year, and instead of what it's supposed to be about, helping the community, it's kids in military formation doing jumping jacks, talking about change in red, white, and black jackets.
[01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:50.374]  That looks a lot to me like Hitler Youth in those same color schemes, only a more advanced version of it 60 plus years later.
[01:27:52.092 --> 01:27:54.914]  And yelling, Obama, Obama, Obama!
[01:27:54.914 --> 01:27:57.815]  It's so true!
[01:27:57.815 --> 01:28:01.217]  You're creating a cult, is what you're creating.
[01:28:01.217 --> 01:28:07.320]  And, you know, these young people, they don't know that they're getting brainwashed when they are.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.021]  And they didn't in Germany, for that matter.
[01:28:10.021 --> 01:28:13.783]  And so that's, you know, the path it'll take.
[01:28:13.783 --> 01:28:16.665]  And then you have this, well, why don't you join up with
[01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:20.386]  Uh, the Obama Youth, or whatever it's called.
[01:28:20.386 --> 01:28:26.650]  And before you know it, you have a lot of people, uh, under social pressure, joining.
[01:28:26.650 --> 01:28:30.832]  And then when they find out what, you know, they've gotten themselves into, it's too late!
[01:28:32.136 --> 01:28:39.504]  And as our economy erodes, the only type of programs and jobs that will be offered are from the state.
[01:28:39.504 --> 01:28:41.946]  That's why they passed these acts like the GIVE Act.
[01:28:41.946 --> 01:28:45.250]  So that they, again, could expand government.
[01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:48.293]  Expand your dependence on government.
[01:28:48.713 --> 01:28:50.294]  Oh, give a year to city year.
[01:28:50.294 --> 01:28:51.534]  We'll pay some of your bills.
[01:28:51.534 --> 01:28:53.114]  You'll be able to go to school.
[01:28:53.114 --> 01:28:55.275]  It always sounds like a positive thing.
[01:28:55.275 --> 01:28:57.056]  Oh, you'll get free health care.
[01:28:57.056 --> 01:28:58.276]  Everybody will be covered.
[01:28:58.276 --> 01:29:03.738]  No, it's actually a new tax and you'll get less health care with literal death panels.
[01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:10.080]  And that was alluded to in the mainstream media with the cover of Newsweek saying the case for killing granny.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.501]  These people are sometimes so out in the open, Bob, it shocks me to my very core.
[01:29:16.331 --> 01:29:17.132]  And they don't care.
[01:29:17.132 --> 01:29:20.434]  This has been going on for the last couple of years.
[01:29:20.434 --> 01:29:21.494]  The arrogance.
[01:29:21.494 --> 01:29:23.115]  We are the masters of the universe.
[01:29:23.115 --> 01:29:24.416]  We are the elitists.
[01:29:24.416 --> 01:29:27.198]  And we know better what is good for you than you do.
[01:29:27.198 --> 01:29:28.739]  And we're going to do it to you.
[01:29:28.739 --> 01:29:30.260]  Whether you like it or not.
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:31.280]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.281]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:29:32.281 --> 01:29:33.862]  We're going to come back with Bob Chappin.
[01:29:33.862 --> 01:29:39.665]  We're also going to play this clip of Gordon Brown calling for a global constitution and much more.
[01:29:39.665 --> 01:29:40.926]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:40.926 --> 01:29:41.507]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:51.249 --> 01:29:55.172]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.172 --> 01:30:00.855]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.855 --> 01:30:07.500]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:12.643]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:12.643 --> 01:30:19.288]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:37.539]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it
[01:30:39.524 --> 01:30:41.665]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:41.665 --> 01:30:43.447]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:43.447 --> 01:30:46.348]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:46.348 --> 01:30:50.411]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:30:55.675 --> 01:30:58.036]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:30:58.036 --> 01:30:58.897]  Others don't.
[01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:03.973]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.973 --> 01:31:09.300]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.362]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.362 --> 01:31:16.368]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.368 --> 01:31:17.549]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.549 --> 01:31:18.270]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:20.533]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.533 --> 01:31:21.614]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.614 --> 01:31:23.817]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.817 --> 01:31:25.159]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.159 --> 01:31:26.681]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:31.968]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.968 --> 01:31:35.093]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.533 --> 01:31:39.357]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.357 --> 01:31:40.578]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:41.478]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.478 --> 01:31:42.579]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.579 --> 01:31:43.520]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:44.621]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.621 --> 01:31:47.664]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.664 --> 01:31:49.445]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.445 --> 01:31:50.366]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.342 --> 01:32:01.503]  What's your home worth?
[01:32:01.503 --> 01:32:03.604]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:32:03.604 --> 01:32:06.647]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:32:06.647 --> 01:32:14.372]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:33:13.606 --> 01:33:14.767]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:14.767 --> 01:33:16.088]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[01:33:16.088 --> 01:33:17.409]  We're joined by Bob Chapman.
[01:33:17.409 --> 01:33:23.254]  And before we get to this Gordon Brown clip, where he calls for a global financial constitution.
[01:33:23.254 --> 01:33:26.197]  Gordon, New World Order Brown, as I like to call him.
[01:33:26.197 --> 01:33:29.780]  I want to thank one of our great sponsors, FrontSight.com.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:31.381]  That's FrontSight.com.
[01:33:31.381 --> 01:33:34.824]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:33:34.824 --> 01:33:39.428]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30
[01:33:40.589 --> 01:33:41.510]  I want to get to this clip.
[01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:43.571]  This is Gordon Brown, this February.
[01:34:01.363 --> 01:34:06.265]  A little, I think about two months ago now, calling for a global constitution.
[01:34:06.265 --> 01:34:11.948]  Nothing short of a global constitution to regulate all financial systems.
[01:34:11.948 --> 01:34:25.434]  And this coming on the heels of last year's announcement that the IMF would actually be absorbing the SEC and Federal Reserve as they came into a more cohesive unit under the United Nations and global governance.
[01:34:25.434 --> 01:34:25.934]  Let's hit it.
[01:34:26.806 --> 01:34:38.777]  Now, over the last decade, Policy Network has performed a momentous role in the development of progressive thinking, bringing us together as one global progressive family.
[01:34:38.777 --> 01:34:43.681]  And I think few organisations could have achieved more in such a short space of time.
[01:34:43.681 --> 01:34:48.866]  So I too want to thank Lord Sainsbury's and all those who have contributed to the board of Policy Network.
[01:34:49.628 --> 01:34:58.611]  And let me say it is an honor to welcome here today the leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, Mona Sallin.
[01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:04.073]  I'm very grateful that she has managed to be with us and I thank her for the work she's doing right across Europe.
[01:35:04.073 --> 01:35:05.114]  Commissioner Omunia.
[01:35:06.154 --> 01:35:09.695]  It is a great pleasure to have you here, and we will have discussions later in the day.
[01:35:09.695 --> 01:35:14.397]  Pascal Lamy, the head of the World Trade Organization, is to be with us.
[01:35:14.397 --> 01:35:20.119]  And it's an honor also that we will be able to welcome Prime Minister Stoltenberg and Zapatero to Britain.
[01:35:20.119 --> 01:35:21.999]  Alright, let's stop the clip right there.
[01:35:21.999 --> 01:35:29.402]  See, right there he's giving homage to all of his globalist crime partners and admitting we couldn't have gotten this done without you.
[01:35:29.402 --> 01:35:30.002]  Let's continue.
[01:35:31.198 --> 01:35:35.061]  As you know, he's been a global leader in development and climate change.
[01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:40.866]  And let me thank him and Norway for their pioneering initiatives on health, education, and the environment.
[01:35:40.866 --> 01:35:53.477]  And Prime Minister Zapatero, who will join us later, has inspired the world with his passion and program for social rights, his commitment to equality for women, and his determination that Spain will lead in international aid for the poorest countries of the world.
[01:35:53.737 --> 01:35:55.159]  Alright, let's pause it right there.
[01:35:55.159 --> 01:36:00.466]  See, he talks about climate change, to speak to the well-meaning idiots out there, social equality.
[01:36:00.466 --> 01:36:08.657]  They cloak themselves as the heroes, as the saviors, as they openly announce despotic one-world government.
[01:36:08.657 --> 01:36:09.017]  Let's go.
[01:36:09.938 --> 01:36:15.462]  Actions they, and so many of you have taken, founded on progressive beliefs that you hold.
[01:36:15.462 --> 01:36:23.187]  We have seen, our Prime Minister Stoltenberg, Prime Minister Zapater, and all of you, changing the world for the better over these last few years.
[01:36:23.187 --> 01:36:25.988]  And we're very proud of all that you have achieved.
[01:36:25.988 --> 01:36:30.151]  We thank all of you for joining us here in London today.
[01:36:30.151 --> 01:36:34.634]  Today I want us to imagine what people will say of us all a century from now.
[01:36:35.899 --> 01:36:40.642]  People look back on the moments that are the turning points in world history.
[01:36:40.642 --> 01:36:41.122]  1789, 1848, 1945, 1989.
[01:36:41.122 --> 01:36:49.206]  Only in retrospect do people see the significance of the times that they are living through.
[01:36:49.206 --> 01:36:59.052]  But in the last two years, our world has been suffering not just an ordinary economic downturn, but what will be remembered as the first crisis of globalization.
[01:36:59.392 --> 01:37:00.873]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:37:00.873 --> 01:37:04.137]  The first crisis of globalization.
[01:37:04.137 --> 01:37:06.739]  These people bring order out of chaos.
[01:37:06.739 --> 01:37:08.421]  They look for these crises.
[01:37:08.421 --> 01:37:14.466]  They create these crises in order to incrementally institute their policies.
[01:37:14.466 --> 01:37:14.847]  Let's go.
[01:37:15.998 --> 01:37:27.626]  It's the first crisis of a world being totally transformed by the scale of global financial flows, by the global sourcing of goods, and by the speed, the scale, and the scope of globalization itself.
[01:37:27.626 --> 01:37:36.312]  And it's a world of massive new opportunities that I want to talk about, but also, as we found, a world of massive new uncertainties and insecurities too.
[01:37:37.395 --> 01:37:49.672]  What we have experienced is not just the usual inflation-driven economic crises such as we have seen in the past 50 years, but a wholesale crisis that has gone right to the heart of the global financial system itself.
[01:37:50.635 --> 01:38:06.511]  And so it is time for us, as we reflect on these events, to draw conclusions about the new framework and the new policies we do need to build a stronger and fairer world economy that will meet the needs of its citizens in this new global age.
[01:38:06.511 --> 01:38:13.719]  Quite simply, without radical change, we will not be able to emerge from the crisis into a stronger, fairer, more stable future.
[01:38:13.939 --> 01:38:14.899]  Let's stop it right here.
[01:38:14.899 --> 01:38:17.560]  A new global age.
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.421]  They're always talking about this new age that's coming.
[01:38:20.421 --> 01:38:22.741]  We need new radical ideas.
[01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:25.222]  Everything is new, new, new, new, new.
[01:38:25.222 --> 01:38:27.543]  Global, global, global, global, global, global.
[01:38:27.543 --> 01:38:32.424]  And he's about to announce his world financial constitution.
[01:38:32.424 --> 01:38:33.784]  Hit the clip.
[01:38:33.784 --> 01:38:37.425]  What are my proposals for discussion today?
[01:38:37.425 --> 01:38:42.627]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:38:44.235 --> 01:38:52.240]  Secondly, I believe that each country needs national growth and jobs strategies that are founded on science, innovation, and skills for the future.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.781]  Alright, let's stop.
[01:38:54.781 --> 01:38:55.722]  Now there it is again.
[01:38:55.722 --> 01:38:58.163]  He calls for the world constitution.
[01:38:58.163 --> 01:39:00.785]  Then the second thing is, oh, we're going to create jobs.
[01:39:00.785 --> 01:39:02.766]  We're going to have a better economy.
[01:39:02.766 --> 01:39:09.710]  They always act like their solution is going to be for the betterment of humanity, Bob, but that isn't the case, is it?
[01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:11.111]  No, it's not.
[01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:12.372]  Absolutely not.
[01:39:12.372 --> 01:39:12.832]  And, um,
[01:39:13.957 --> 01:39:16.319]  This gentleman is not a gentleman.
[01:39:16.319 --> 01:39:27.508]  He's one of the most disgusting creatures in the New World Order movement on a plane with people like Henry Kissinger and the Bushes.
[01:39:27.508 --> 01:39:32.532]  And, you know, the people don't know what he's talking about.
[01:39:32.532 --> 01:39:34.794]  It just sounds good to them.
[01:39:34.794 --> 01:39:39.258]  And I talked about that today on that interview in Athens.
[01:39:39.258 --> 01:39:41.800]  And, you know, people have got to do their homework.
[01:39:42.441 --> 01:39:48.646]  They have to understand what these people have created and where they're headed with this thing.
[01:39:48.646 --> 01:40:00.797]  He's telling you, and that's what Greece was all about, and they're going to lead us into this deflationary depression down the road here a year and a half or two or three, whatever it is.
[01:40:00.797 --> 01:40:04.680]  And from there on out, it's going to be a struggle to survive.
[01:40:05.487 --> 01:40:15.998]  I want to bring Ted Anderson of Midas Resources up right now to tell people how they can try to survive in this global financial crisis, which Gordon Brown was just openly talking about.
[01:40:15.998 --> 01:40:27.490]  If you want to maintain the real value you worked so hard for the past 20, 30, 40 years, or you want to have a future, it is so important to get into precious metals, gold and silver.
[01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:27.670]  Ted?
[01:40:28.223 --> 01:40:29.024]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[01:40:29.024 --> 01:40:40.716]  Well, that is for sure, because your other alternative is a fiat paper currency, and every single country right now is resorting to a printing press to solve their problems, you know, with Greece falling apart.
[01:40:40.716 --> 01:40:42.677]  Well, I shouldn't even go to Greece.
[01:40:42.677 --> 01:40:50.866]  I mean, right here in the United States, the budget is so far out of whack, and there's just so much debt being pounded on top of debt on top of debt.
[01:40:51.326 --> 01:40:53.848]  It's just compounding against the taxpayers.
[01:40:53.848 --> 01:41:01.032]  Really, even if we didn't have a world crisis, we will be eaten alive by the interest that is going to just consume us.
[01:41:01.032 --> 01:41:07.015]  And believe me, the United States government is to stop and stave off any kind of problems they have.
[01:41:07.015 --> 01:41:13.179]  They're going to go to the Federal Reserve System, the open market operation, and they're going to ask them to buy a 30-year U.S.
[01:41:13.179 --> 01:41:17.101]  Treasury bill so it can be spent into the economy, which means a lot of
[01:41:17.601 --> 01:41:21.969]  A lot of new money that's being printed out of nothing, out of thin air.
[01:41:21.969 --> 01:41:23.111]  No value to it at all.
[01:41:23.111 --> 01:41:26.097]  And that money is going to be competing with your labor.
[01:41:26.784 --> 01:41:34.288]  And I don't know how in the world the United States citizen is going to be able to survive in a scenario like that, but that's what we're dealing with.
[01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:45.475]  And there is just absolutely no other way that you can explain it other than the fact that the United States government is willing to destroy our currency in order to fall in line, I guess, with this New World Order.
[01:41:45.475 --> 01:41:50.138]  It just simply should not, could not, should never have happened.
[01:41:50.138 --> 01:41:52.499]  The United States, the people who founded this country,
[01:41:53.502 --> 01:42:01.729]  Set up a constitution so this would not happen and for whatever reason we decided to ignore it in 1913 and we're paying big time because of it.
[01:42:02.526 --> 01:42:02.946]  Right now.
[01:42:02.946 --> 01:42:04.947]  And I just, it makes me so angry.
[01:42:04.947 --> 01:42:07.168]  And we continue to ignore it, Ted.
[01:42:07.168 --> 01:42:07.689]  That's the thing.
[01:42:07.689 --> 01:42:14.512]  We continue to let it get eviscerated and ripped apart and become more and more irrelevant as the days pass on.
[01:42:14.512 --> 01:42:15.193]  It sure is.
[01:42:15.193 --> 01:42:19.835]  And it's taken the country that was once a great superpower and turning it into a third world country.
[01:42:19.835 --> 01:42:21.936]  And it's just sad to see that happen.
[01:42:21.936 --> 01:42:24.838]  But what you're talking about right now is what are we going to do about it?
[01:42:25.998 --> 01:42:39.069]  Alex asked me if I'd hold that Frank price down at $249.68, even though gold now is shot up over $1,160 an ounce, close to $1,170 an ounce, and I told him I would.
[01:42:39.069 --> 01:42:40.630]  He's on vacation.
[01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:41.311]  I wish him well.
[01:42:41.311 --> 01:42:45.434]  I hope he's having a great R&R there because he works so darn hard.
[01:42:45.434 --> 01:42:53.020]  But we have the Frank currently right now at $249.68, and yes, you will get the subscription to the International Forecaster if you just buy one.
[01:42:53.513 --> 01:42:55.675]  That's Bob's International Forecaster.
[01:42:55.675 --> 01:42:58.117]  That's Bob Chapman's newsletter.
[01:42:58.117 --> 01:42:59.799]  Just a great newsletter.
[01:42:59.799 --> 01:43:02.522]  And I just can't lay it out for you better than that.
[01:43:02.522 --> 01:43:06.405]  Right now you're buying gold for less than $500 an ounce.
[01:43:06.405 --> 01:43:10.129]  That's less than half of the price when you consider the discount for that subscription.
[01:43:10.129 --> 01:43:13.192]  This coin contains a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[01:43:14.222 --> 01:43:20.687]  So you can call 1-800-686-2237 or you can go to Midas Resources right now.
[01:43:20.687 --> 01:43:24.209]  Ted, explain to people where the dollar's going.
[01:43:24.209 --> 01:43:26.310]  We just see the dollar going down, down, down.
[01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:29.993]  And like you said, gold is almost up to $1,200 today.
[01:43:29.993 --> 01:43:34.856]  Once it gets past that $1,200 mark, do you think we'll be able to hit $1,500 within the next few months?
[01:43:34.856 --> 01:43:37.098]  Because we did see a large spike this year.
[01:43:37.538 --> 01:43:39.319]  Yeah, we sure have.
[01:43:39.319 --> 01:43:44.141]  And $1,500 an ounce, I think, is going to be reality before we see the calendar turn.
[01:43:44.141 --> 01:43:50.663]  I wasn't sure whether if we'd see it by spring, and I don't think we will, unless if something really radical happens right now.
[01:43:50.663 --> 01:43:56.806]  And I know that Greece has a lot of problems, but I'm sure that we're going to see $1,500 an ounce before the end of the year.
[01:43:56.806 --> 01:44:02.428]  I must predicate this, though, too, if you're getting into gold and silver, you can lose money.
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:12.388]  The price can go down on you and if you're trying to sell in the marketplace when the market is not favorable to the conditions for you, you might not get as much as you put into this.
[01:44:12.388 --> 01:44:21.376]  However, I also will say that if anybody had purchased gold in the last 10 years or gold back to 10 years ago, by now you would have quadrupled
[01:44:22.088 --> 01:44:24.771]  The amount of money that you'd get if you were to sell.
[01:44:24.771 --> 01:44:41.667]  Now I would say that gold is a much safer bet seeing as how it has a 6,000 year history of holding value and the United States currency has only been valued without gold since 1971 and has done nothing but slide down backwards and lose purchasing power.
[01:44:41.667 --> 01:44:43.909]  I think it's a safe bet to own gold right now.
[01:44:44.329 --> 01:44:45.290]  I think it's the only bet.
[01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:57.642]  I remember listening to Alex Jones back in 2003 when gold was hovering around $290 to $330 an ounce and then that just shooting up over the next four or five years.
[01:44:57.642 --> 01:45:01.265]  Then I remember, not this Christmas, but the Christmas before this, gold was around $800.
[01:45:01.265 --> 01:45:07.931]  It had peaked around $900 and I was talking to my stepfather and I'm saying, listen, you should probably get into this even though it's going down.
[01:45:08.772 --> 01:45:09.753]  I don't know, Jason.
[01:45:09.753 --> 01:45:10.834]  I don't know where it's going to go.
[01:45:10.834 --> 01:45:15.199]  And a year later, it's up around $1,100.
[01:45:15.199 --> 01:45:16.980]  So, really, there is no roof on this thing.
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:18.802]  It's an actual precious metal.
[01:45:18.802 --> 01:45:20.224]  It's a hard currency.
[01:45:20.224 --> 01:45:21.405]  It's not a fiat currency.
[01:45:21.405 --> 01:45:24.808]  And that's why we encourage people to get involved in gold and silver.
[01:45:24.808 --> 01:45:26.830]  It's MidasResources.com.
[01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:27.871]  What's the number, Ted?
[01:45:27.871 --> 01:45:28.091]  It's 1-800-686-7000.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:31.260]  2237.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:31.580]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:33.861]  You do have to mention that you heard it on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:36.822]  If you don't, that coin's closer to $255, I believe it is right now.
[01:45:44.727 --> 01:45:48.669]  And you will not get the year's subscription to the International Forecaster.
[01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:50.090]  I mean, you can't beat the deal.
[01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:53.011]  I really have really cut it right down to the bone.
[01:45:53.011 --> 01:45:58.674]  I'm losing money to the point of about 50 cents on the dollar for everybody who buys from me right now.
[01:45:58.674 --> 01:46:04.998]  I just can't go much longer than this, but I will hold that until Sunday at midnight.
[01:46:04.998 --> 01:46:12.942]  So if you're interested in picking it up, and you've heard this broadcast, and you call in before Sunday at midnight, you will get this deal.
[01:46:14.178 --> 01:46:15.599]  All right, Ted, thank you so much.
[01:46:15.599 --> 01:46:18.381]  MidasResources.com is the website.
[01:46:18.381 --> 01:46:21.624]  Going back to Bob Chapman.
[01:46:21.624 --> 01:46:23.465]  Bob, you've seen it firsthand.
[01:46:23.465 --> 01:46:29.450]  People who get into the precious metals market, they have a real future because they have a hard currency.
[01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:30.591]  They have real savings.
[01:46:30.591 --> 01:46:32.572]  Their pension isn't getting gutted.
[01:46:32.572 --> 01:46:35.675]  Their 401k isn't evaporating.
[01:46:36.075 --> 01:46:37.416]  It's the only safe place to be.
[01:46:53.852 --> 01:47:05.235]  And when you have the Richard Russell Dow Theory letter, 60 years in existence, he's 86 years old now, saying, I think that the Dow's going back down to 1,000.
[01:47:05.235 --> 01:47:11.217]  The world's got a real problem in front of it, and I think he's right.
[01:47:11.217 --> 01:47:17.178]  And Joe Granville says the same thing, and so do I. So it's the only safe place to be.
[01:47:17.178 --> 01:47:22.820]  You've got to have gold and silver coins, and you've got to have, if you can,
[01:47:23.886 --> 01:47:28.974]  Uh, uh, dehydrated and freeze-dried foods and a water filter.
[01:47:28.974 --> 01:47:30.417]  Method of defending your family.
[01:47:32.208 --> 01:47:39.812]  And again, right now they're promoting that the economy is getting better, but they've been telling you that the last 6 months, the last 12 months, the last 18 months.
[01:47:39.812 --> 01:47:41.573]  Oh no, the economy's fine.
[01:47:41.573 --> 01:47:44.214]  Larry Summers told me that the recession was over.
[01:47:44.214 --> 01:47:50.497]  It doesn't matter that they're making up terms like double dip recession when we're in a depression in this country.
[01:47:50.497 --> 01:47:53.279]  20 plus percent real unemployment.
[01:47:53.279 --> 01:47:55.240]  You were talking about that value added tax.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:55.840]  They may not even
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:58.882]  Go to the value-added text before they start gouging prices.
[01:47:58.882 --> 01:47:59.902]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:47:59.902 --> 01:48:00.723]  Strong U.S.
[01:48:00.723 --> 01:48:03.384]  earnings seen, but may be priced in.
[01:48:03.384 --> 01:48:03.684]  U.S.
[01:48:03.684 --> 01:48:12.369]  corporate earnings should top forecasts again this quarter, but the extent of the stock markets rally means investors are expecting a lot from companies, so they just might charge you more.
[01:48:12.369 --> 01:48:18.313]  And again, they're giving away record bonuses after a $27 trillion-plus bailout, Bob.
[01:48:18.313 --> 01:48:19.714]  These people have no shame.
[01:48:21.343 --> 01:48:22.784]  None whatsoever.
[01:48:22.784 --> 01:48:34.013]  And you know, the big cuts that they've made in order to improve their earnings, particularly last year, were in the area where 75% of their cost is.
[01:48:34.013 --> 01:48:35.494]  And that's people.
[01:48:35.494 --> 01:48:37.095]  And that's why unemployment is 22.8%.
[01:48:37.095 --> 01:48:40.258]  What does the country look like?
[01:48:40.258 --> 01:48:42.740]  They're not going to be able to continue to do that either.
[01:48:43.755 --> 01:48:47.397]  So again, what does a country look like with a 40% unemployment rate?
[01:48:47.397 --> 01:48:50.819]  I mean, that's not out of the realm of possibility at this very moment.
[01:48:50.819 --> 01:48:53.700]  There are people out there that are very hard up for work.
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:55.801]  In fact, I've had families call into this show.
[01:48:55.801 --> 01:48:57.242]  My mom's a teacher.
[01:48:57.242 --> 01:48:58.243]  I'm a teacher.
[01:48:58.243 --> 01:48:59.784]  My dad had a union job.
[01:48:59.784 --> 01:49:01.484]  He was laid off three years ago.
[01:49:01.484 --> 01:49:02.425]  My mom was laid off
[01:49:02.745 --> 01:49:04.306]  And that's correct, and it will continue.
[01:49:04.306 --> 01:49:08.467]  And in the meantime, they'll go and arrange a war, and then people will get deprecated and they'll go off and get killed.
[01:49:32.225 --> 01:49:33.826]  It is the trick of the elite.
[01:49:33.826 --> 01:49:42.248]  In fact, I believe it was Smedley Butler who said that war is the biggest racket out there and it is a racket for us to die for.
[01:49:42.248 --> 01:49:45.790]  For people that never really owned anything to begin with.
[01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:47.150]  They will create an enemy.
[01:49:47.150 --> 01:49:48.971]  They will induce fear upon you.
[01:49:48.971 --> 01:49:49.891]  They will make you feel that
[01:49:50.231 --> 01:49:54.215]  Jingoistic, patriotic spirit where you don't question anything.
[01:49:54.215 --> 01:49:56.276]  How I felt after 9-11.
[01:49:56.276 --> 01:50:04.703]  How I felt after I thought that Muslim extremists had betrayed us on the highest level by killing men, women, and children in the World Trade Center.
[01:50:04.703 --> 01:50:09.568]  I had no idea about this globalist program for a one world order.
[01:50:09.568 --> 01:50:14.512]  And that's why I made my latest film, Invisible Empire, a new world order to find.
[01:50:14.512 --> 01:50:15.693]  You can pre-order it today.
[01:50:15.933 --> 01:50:16.433]  We're good to go!
[01:50:34.938 --> 01:50:45.324]  Michael Mullen, Steny Hoyer, George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, and many many others including Brent Scowcroft, Henry Kissinger, Charlie Rose, the list goes on.
[01:50:45.324 --> 01:50:48.165]  We're going to come back one final segment with Bob Chapman.
[01:50:48.165 --> 01:50:49.106]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:49.106 --> 01:50:51.928]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:51:01.147 --> 01:51:02.448]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.448 --> 01:51:08.034]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.034 --> 01:51:13.059]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.059 --> 01:51:18.625]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.625 --> 01:51:23.330]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.837 --> 01:51:30.959]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.959 --> 01:51:32.079]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.079 --> 01:51:34.860]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:38.761]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:51:45.062 --> 01:51:45.282]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.282 --> 01:51:45.542]  Remember,
[01:51:53.911 --> 01:51:57.813]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.813 --> 01:52:01.274]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.274 --> 01:52:02.195]  You worry.
[01:52:02.195 --> 01:52:04.216]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:52:04.216 --> 01:52:06.757]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:52:06.757 --> 01:52:08.838]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?

[01:52:10.458 --> 01:52:14.060]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:19.282]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:52:19.282 --> 01:52:22.584]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:52:23.084 --> 01:52:24.766]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:52:24.766 --> 01:52:27.628]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:52:27.628 --> 01:52:30.951]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:52:30.951 --> 01:52:39.377]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[01:54:08.291 --> 01:54:11.594]  Final segment with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:54:11.594 --> 01:54:12.454]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:12.454 --> 01:54:14.696]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:54:14.696 --> 01:54:18.919]  Alex will be up in the next hour, the next segment.
[01:54:18.919 --> 01:54:31.609]  Bob, we now live in a society where they openly steal pension funds, where they're telling us that our entitlement programs, such as Social Security, that we have bought into for so many decades, are no longer going to be available for us.
[01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:35.932]  They are telling us that this is a de-industrialized nation, that we don't have
[01:54:36.452 --> 01:54:40.357]  Any real manufacturing jobs in this country.
[01:54:40.357 --> 01:54:43.881]  What will we become in the next five to ten years?
[01:54:43.881 --> 01:54:49.508]  Will we become an amalgamated part of a North American Union in this New World Order plot?
[01:54:49.508 --> 01:54:54.194]  Or will it just forego that altogether and be part of this global government hegemony?
[01:54:55.802 --> 01:55:11.209]  Well, I think that the devaluations and the defaults will bring in, at that time, the cutting of these entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare, probably by two-thirds, for starters.
[01:55:11.209 --> 01:55:18.812]  And that'll be justified by the fact that the economy is in the tank still, and it's getting worse.
[01:55:18.812 --> 01:55:20.553]  The funding isn't there.
[01:55:20.553 --> 01:55:25.175]  And also, the cost of this new, ongoing war.
[01:55:26.224 --> 01:55:32.426]  And the amount of money the government is going to spend is not going to, uh, diminuate.
[01:55:32.426 --> 01:55:33.427]  It's not going to stop.
[01:55:33.427 --> 01:55:35.427]  It's going to get worse.
[01:55:35.427 --> 01:55:46.111]  And of course, all the jobs that have left the country, uh, have left the country because it was done deliberately to de-industrialize the United States.
[01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:50.152]  And that's part of bringing the United States to its knees.
[01:55:50.152 --> 01:55:54.794]  So when we have that happen over the next couple of years,
[01:55:55.495 --> 01:56:02.079]  We're also going to have a collapse in the stock market and higher interest rates, which means a collapse in the bond market.
[01:56:02.079 --> 01:56:16.867]  And with all of that said, all of the groundwork, the seed work is there, along with the war, to cut all of these costs that the government doesn't want, and of course getting rid of older people, and lots of young people too in the wars.
[01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:24.053]  And the only real question, Bob, is whether we, the people, are going to step up to the plate and say no.
[01:56:24.053 --> 01:56:41.902]  If we, the people, are going to declare that Ben Bernanke isn't truly the man of the year as Time Magazine propagates, along with Hitler and others throughout history, while he tells us that we are going to be taxed to death and that we will no longer have the programs that our taxes supposedly paid for for all
[01:56:42.242 --> 01:56:58.669]  Those years I want to encourage people to get out into the streets to become more active to not fall for the Johnny nonsense that is thrust upon you in the mainstream media of CNN, The Washington Post, The Washington Times, The New York Times, Fox News.
[01:56:58.669 --> 01:57:00.389]  No, they're not good either.
[01:57:00.389 --> 01:57:02.690]  They're still promoters of war and death.
[01:57:02.690 --> 01:57:04.851]  If you can't see that, please look at
[01:57:05.111 --> 01:57:18.947]  At those reporters and children being gunned down, judge, jury, and executioner from the sky, styled by our very own troops, the people that are supposed to be defending this country from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:57:18.947 --> 01:57:23.312]  I'm sorry, but reporters that are trying to tell the truth are not our enemies.
[01:57:23.312 --> 01:57:24.553]  So please get out there.
[01:57:24.553 --> 01:57:25.354]  Please spread the word.
[01:57:26.215 --> 01:57:30.978]  My latest film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, and Police State 4.
[01:57:30.978 --> 01:57:32.079]  I'm in Police State 4.
[01:57:32.079 --> 01:57:39.004]  You can see me at the G20, really getting down and dirty with the troops that shouldn't be on the streets in the first place.
[01:57:39.004 --> 01:57:43.267]  None of them could even tell me what posse comitatus was, Bob.
[01:57:43.267 --> 01:57:49.852]  These are people that were anywhere from 18 to 19 year old new recruits to 45 and 50 year old colonels and generals.
[01:57:49.852 --> 01:57:52.914]  They could not tell me what posse comitatus was, Bob.
[01:57:54.557 --> 01:58:01.210]  No, and they don't think it's necessary for them to know those things.
[01:58:01.210 --> 01:58:07.121]  They know military nomenclature, and that's where it begins and ends.
[01:58:08.322 --> 01:58:10.183]  They're there protecting my freedoms.
[01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:12.165]  We're here so you got a freedom of speech.
[01:58:12.165 --> 01:58:17.728]  And I'm like, no, you're here in violation of the emergence of police and military.
[01:58:17.728 --> 01:58:28.395]  When we have the police and military on the streets as the police, we live in a police state like that of China or Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.
[01:58:28.395 --> 01:58:29.676]  That's not my style.
[01:58:29.676 --> 01:58:32.198]  Alex Jones coming up after this segment.
[01:58:32.198 --> 01:58:33.339]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:37.782]  Bob Chavin, The International Forecaster dot com, Infowars dot com, PrisonPlanet dot TV.
[01:58:42.586 --> 01:58:44.007]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.007 --> 01:58:46.530]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.734 --> 01:58:53.036]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:58:53.036 --> 01:58:55.438]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:58:55.438 --> 01:58:58.640]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:03.744]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:59:03.744 --> 01:59:08.268]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:59:08.268 --> 01:59:10.710]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:13.152]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:59:13.152 --> 01:59:16.014]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:59:16.394 --> 01:59:24.338]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:59:24.338 --> 01:59:29.720]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:32.041]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:59:32.041 --> 01:59:35.983]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:59:36.263 --> 01:59:37.344]  And I got news for you.
[01:59:37.344 --> 01:59:38.685]  You're everyone else.
[01:59:38.685 --> 01:59:40.166]  Invisible Empire.

[01:59:53.837 --> 01:59:56.199]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.199 --> 01:59:59.002]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:08.935 --> 02:00:11.836]  Well, we normally twist his arm to stay even longer than an hour.
[02:00:11.836 --> 02:00:15.899]  We can't do that today because this is the last hour of the radio broadcast.
[02:00:15.899 --> 02:00:17.180]  We're always honored to have him.
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:20.362]  He just flew back in from Mexico last night into New York.
[02:00:20.362 --> 02:00:25.745]  He's kicking off his tour today, and we're honored to have him on with us for the next hour.
[02:00:25.745 --> 02:00:31.709]  I don't know what it was about that last interview, but I heard from Jesse's folks it was his favorite interview here on the show.
[02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:33.050]  Listeners said it was their favorite.
[02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:34.171]  The most views online.
[02:00:34.511 --> 02:00:35.011]  Well, thank you Alex.
[02:01:02.046 --> 02:01:02.907]  We're good to go.
[02:01:22.731 --> 02:01:24.132]  Well, I think that's an endorsement.
[02:01:24.132 --> 02:01:32.199]  Just like the Huffington Post censored your article about 9-11, even though they asked you to write it, now you're seeing censorship in the book world.
[02:01:32.199 --> 02:01:33.381]  That's unheard of.
[02:01:33.381 --> 02:01:37.364]  Four weeks, New York Times Top Ten, and no book reviews.
[02:01:37.364 --> 02:01:44.791]  Yeah, well, there's a few reviews on the internet, but there's been no reviews by any of the major media.
[02:01:45.311 --> 02:01:47.193]  No reviews of the book at all.
[02:01:47.193 --> 02:01:53.398]  I think it's a case, Alex, where they feel that if they review it, they give it credibility, so they're staying away from it.
[02:01:54.847 --> 02:01:55.448]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:55.448 --> 02:02:05.536]  We'll walk through some of the things that are covered in the book and why it's seen as controversial, but, you know, that's why the mainstream media is dying, is because people know they're acting as gatekeepers.
[02:02:05.536 --> 02:02:06.977]  Oh, there's no doubt about it.
[02:02:06.977 --> 02:02:17.085]  You know, they, uh, I just spoke earlier on another show, and they asked me how I, if, why the mainstream media will question the government.
[02:02:17.085 --> 02:02:22.069]  And I said it's simple, because if they don't play along with the government, they get no access to them.
[02:02:23.258 --> 02:02:24.759]  It is the kiss of death.
[02:02:24.759 --> 02:02:27.980]  When we come back, I want to get into the war.
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:28.320]  We're now
[02:02:49.491 --> 02:02:54.814]  Almost seven years into Iraq, or we are seven years in now, in March, last month.
[02:02:54.814 --> 02:02:56.175]  This was the seventh anniversary.
[02:02:56.175 --> 02:03:01.518]  We're eight years into Afghanistan and there's just no end in sight.
[02:03:01.518 --> 02:03:02.659]  I mean, when is it going to end?
[02:03:02.659 --> 02:03:07.302]  Well, first thing I'd like to ask you, Alex, is what the hell are we accomplishing?
[02:03:10.094 --> 02:03:12.215]  A bunch of weapon sales and oil?
[02:03:12.215 --> 02:03:15.357]  You know, that's the bottom line for me.
[02:03:15.357 --> 02:03:22.240]  And maybe I say this selfishly, but how have these two wars helped Jesse Ventura?
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:25.502]  Or how have these two wars helped Alex Jones?
[02:03:25.502 --> 02:03:29.624]  Or how have these two wars helped the average Joe citizen of this country?
[02:03:29.624 --> 02:03:37.948]  Other than bankrupting us, what is the ultimate goal that we will achieve to where we can all feel good about them?
[02:03:40.683 --> 02:03:41.283]  Absolutely.
[02:03:41.283 --> 02:03:43.464]  I mean, if our country was invaded, that'd be one thing.
[02:03:43.464 --> 02:03:47.045]  Or even if we were an evil empire and the empire gave us some of the booty.
[02:03:47.045 --> 02:03:52.226]  But no, we pay for it for offshore corporations that get the money and power.
[02:03:52.226 --> 02:03:52.926]  Exactly.
[02:03:52.926 --> 02:03:56.627]  And we're sitting here, our kids are dying over there.
[02:03:56.627 --> 02:03:59.928]  Well, you know what it clearly shows me, Alex?
[02:03:59.928 --> 02:04:04.009]  People should really wake up to the fact that the President ain't in charge.
[02:04:05.336 --> 02:04:06.777]  That's a good point.
[02:04:06.777 --> 02:04:10.539]  Because clearly Obama ran to get us out of the wars.
[02:04:10.539 --> 02:04:14.182]  He said he'd close down Gitmo.
[02:04:14.182 --> 02:04:20.446]  He said all of this stuff and yet it's all gone the opposite way, hasn't it?
[02:04:20.446 --> 02:04:21.087]  It has.
[02:04:21.087 --> 02:04:22.948]  We're more into the wars.
[02:04:22.948 --> 02:04:24.769]  Gitmo's still here.
[02:04:24.769 --> 02:04:29.512]  So people should see clearly that the President is no longer in charge of the country.
[02:04:36.491 --> 02:04:43.996]  And I've documented that the government's provocateuring militias and other groups to demonize the Tea Parties and any opposition to that.
[02:04:43.996 --> 02:04:47.719]  We'll talk about it all with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:04:47.719 --> 02:04:49.500]  His new book, a bestseller.
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:52.902]  Let's send it to number one on the New York Times bestseller list.
[02:04:52.902 --> 02:04:53.323]  It's in news
[02:04:54.984 --> 02:05:02.052]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.052 --> 02:05:07.638]  Did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:07.638 --> 02:05:09.240]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:12.641]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[02:05:12.641 --> 02:05:18.224]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:05:18.224 --> 02:05:23.446]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:07:01.038 --> 02:07:04.059]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.059 --> 02:07:09.361]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.361 --> 02:07:11.422]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.422 --> 02:07:16.423]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.423 --> 02:07:17.604]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.604 --> 02:07:18.344]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.724 --> 02:07:20.606]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.606 --> 02:07:21.687]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.687 --> 02:07:23.889]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.889 --> 02:07:25.231]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.231 --> 02:07:26.752]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.752 --> 02:07:32.038]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.038 --> 02:07:35.161]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.601 --> 02:07:39.424]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.424 --> 02:07:40.644]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.644 --> 02:07:41.545]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.545 --> 02:07:42.666]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.666 --> 02:07:43.406]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.406 --> 02:07:44.687]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.687 --> 02:07:47.729]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.729 --> 02:07:49.510]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:50.431]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.259 --> 02:08:04.487]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.487 --> 02:08:07.839]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.251 --> 02:08:19.094]  Well, his television show got picked up for a second season.
[02:08:19.094 --> 02:08:23.036]  Record first season on TruTV, their number one news show.
[02:08:23.036 --> 02:08:36.825]  And we're going to talk about, because I keep getting these questions, I know Jesse's wondering, with all this censorship, with all this control, not one major news book reviewer will talk about his number four on the New York Times bestseller list.
[02:08:37.725 --> 02:08:39.527]  American conspiracies.
[02:08:39.527 --> 02:08:41.908]  Four weeks in the top ten.
[02:08:41.908 --> 02:08:43.350]  So why is that being censored?
[02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:44.391]  Why do I get censored?
[02:08:44.391 --> 02:08:46.732]  But why is he allowed to have a TV show?
[02:08:46.732 --> 02:08:48.634]  We'll talk about that some coming up today.
[02:08:48.634 --> 02:08:50.596]  We'll talk about opium trafficking.
[02:08:50.596 --> 02:08:52.117]  We'll get into a whole host of issues.
[02:08:52.117 --> 02:08:53.458]  Pat Tillman, you name it.
[02:08:53.458 --> 02:08:57.081]  But Governor Jesse Ventura, for those who just joined us, we started getting into
[02:08:57.933 --> 02:09:17.135]  Eight years of Iraq, or seven years of Iraq, eight years of Afghanistan, no end in sight, new wars, they're expanding, all this footage coming out of reporters being massacred, being targeted, children being gunned down by Apache helicopters, premeditatedly, all of that happening, and we were discussing during the break
[02:09:18.982 --> 02:09:34.222]  Well, I really don't think he does, and what's really educated me, Alex, is I've been reading, I've read, I'm in the process of finishing my second book by Colonel Fletcher Prouty.
[02:09:35.527 --> 02:09:37.689]  And I highly recommend both of them.
[02:09:37.689 --> 02:09:39.751]  People need to read the Colonel's books.
[02:09:39.751 --> 02:09:42.774]  He died in 2001, in June.
[02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:49.140]  But if you read Fletcher Prouty's books, one of them is called The Secret Team, and the other one is called JFK.
[02:09:50.578 --> 02:09:58.386]  And if you read those two books, it will become very clear that the history you've been taught is not the history of what's happened.
[02:09:58.386 --> 02:10:01.268]  And let me make my point here for a moment.
[02:10:01.268 --> 02:10:03.190]  Crowdy was there.
[02:10:03.190 --> 02:10:08.075]  Who Fletcher Crowdy was, do you remember the movie JFK by Oliver Stone, of course?
[02:10:08.075 --> 02:10:08.676]  Yes.
[02:10:08.676 --> 02:10:10.838]  He is the Donald Sutherland character.
[02:10:12.469 --> 02:10:24.278]  He is the real life Mr. X, the guy that Costner goes to Washington and talks to him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, then they sit on that bench, and he lays the whole thing out.
[02:10:24.278 --> 02:10:31.003]  Well, in real life, that was Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty, Colonel of the United States Air Force.
[02:10:31.003 --> 02:10:38.629]  And for, I think, 11 or 12 years, he was the top man, the liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA.
[02:10:41.169 --> 02:10:45.174]  And I can't tell people how much they need to read to understand.
[02:10:45.174 --> 02:10:55.907]  And when you read Prouty's books, you will become much more clear on what's happening because Prouty tells you in the books that the entire Cold War was a set-up.
[02:10:58.044 --> 02:11:07.929]  That there was a meeting that took place at the end of World War II, right before we technically were going to invade Japan, like Normandy.
[02:11:07.929 --> 02:11:11.531]  And then of course they dropped the two bombs and they didn't have to.
[02:11:11.531 --> 02:11:17.434]  But in preparing for that invasion, they moved massive armaments into Okinawa.
[02:11:18.388 --> 02:11:30.515]  Well, there was a meeting, because Prouty flew in Chiang Kai-shek, and it was between Chiang Kai-shek, who at that time was ahead of China, Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt.
[02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:43.022]  And at that point it was determined that all wars from then on would be fought in third world countries, that there would be no direct objective that the military could achieve in which to declare victory.
[02:11:43.742 --> 02:11:49.026]  Now, look back, Alex, in our history since World War II, is that not all true?
[02:11:49.026 --> 02:11:49.507]  That is.
[02:11:49.507 --> 02:11:52.189]  It's all true.
[02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:55.611]  That's what really resonated with me when I read Prouty's books.
[02:11:55.611 --> 02:12:01.276]  I went, oh my God, the things he said here is exactly what has gone down.
[02:12:01.276 --> 02:12:05.639]  Well, let me be clear... ...in third world countries.
[02:12:05.639 --> 02:12:09.442]  Oh, and remember them armaments that I told you they put in Okinawa?
[02:12:09.442 --> 02:12:10.643]  Do you know what became of those?
[02:12:10.643 --> 02:12:10.683]  No.
[02:12:12.133 --> 02:12:13.774]  They were split in half.
[02:12:13.774 --> 02:12:22.118]  Half of them, according to Colonel Prouty, half of them went to Korea, and half of it went to Ho Chi Minh.
[02:12:22.118 --> 02:12:25.800]  They were setting up for the next two wars.
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:38.207]  Now, it follows through with all of this shit, excuse me, from the radio, I shouldn't have said that, but all of this stuff in Afghanistan, Iraq, and all of it fits right into what Colonel Prouty talked about.
[02:12:38.985 --> 02:12:44.709]  Well, I'm chomping at the bit here and I want to sit back and shut up and you can tell us what you've learned, but this is what's so incredible.
[02:12:44.709 --> 02:13:06.065]  I've known you for about four and a half years now and the process, you knew about Gulf of Tonkin, you knew about the lives of Vietnam, you were very well informed, you've been visited by the CIA when you were governor, but it's been a process of you reading and researching and now to see you, I interviewed Prouty, had to be like in 1997, we've been digging around looking for the tapes,
[02:13:06.625 --> 02:13:08.486]  And I have read over his work.
[02:13:08.486 --> 02:13:11.466]  I've read his first book, not the second one you're talking about.
[02:13:11.466 --> 02:13:20.649]  And then you discover that Joe McCarthy was actually right, but he was being used to set up a police state domestically with low-level communists.
[02:13:20.649 --> 02:13:26.131]  But as soon as he found out the Pentagon was running everything, remember that was what they said was so absurd?
[02:13:26.131 --> 02:13:30.992]  Then they set him up and destroyed him and used the term McCarthyism to demonize him.
[02:13:30.992 --> 02:13:33.793]  But then it was declassified seven years ago or six years ago.
[02:13:34.193 --> 02:13:36.094]  That the Russians said, no, it's true.
[02:13:36.094 --> 02:13:36.734]  He was right.
[02:13:36.734 --> 02:13:41.817]  And then you learn that the whole geopolitical system is a war against individual populations.
[02:13:41.817 --> 02:13:45.379]  And there was a deal with the Russians to build up their police state.
[02:13:45.379 --> 02:13:47.080]  They would take over half the world.
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:47.700]  The U.S.
[02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:59.327]  would build up its police state and military system and take over its other half and go into these black hole wars to then militarize a cadre of men to come back and take over the domestic country itself.
[02:13:59.327 --> 02:14:01.167]  And now you're researching that, Governor.
[02:14:01.167 --> 02:14:01.908]  It's so exciting.
[02:14:02.288 --> 02:14:08.715]  Well, you know, the thing is now, is this, Alex, I have the time to do it now!
[02:14:08.715 --> 02:14:21.689]  You know, when you're being a governor, or you're governing a state, or you're working in that capacity, you don't have time to do any research, because your day is full of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, just doing your job!
[02:14:22.754 --> 02:14:39.587]  And now I don't have that job to do anymore, and living in Mexico like I do for half the year, I read 15, 17 books every winter down there, and it's amazing how reading could educate you, something I think we're losing track of in this country.
[02:14:39.587 --> 02:14:41.268]  Well, I want to be specific.
[02:14:41.268 --> 02:14:47.473]  It's amazing to see your development, and I'm not like on some mountain saying that, because I've noticed your discernment
[02:14:48.053 --> 02:14:48.894]  We're good to go.
[02:15:18.594 --> 02:15:26.800]  Uh, to the Arctic, uh, when they killed JFK, he talked about how they pulled the security off, how it was a Pentagon black ops job.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:35.147]  We're going to play a clip from JFK coming up later, but take your time in the break with more of what you've learned and how you tie that in to all your other life knowledge.
[02:15:36.227 --> 02:15:47.509]  Well, again, it's a case that, uh, you know, Fletcher Prouty just, uh, he lived through it, and, uh, I enjoy reading what he knows about, and he's an exceptionally bright guy.
[02:15:47.509 --> 02:16:02.152]  See, the other thing he shows very clearly, which tells you how Obama isn't really in charge, Prouty shows you that most of the politicians only learn of these events until they're already in motion.
[02:16:03.925 --> 02:16:08.349]  They're set in motion by people in the government.
[02:16:08.349 --> 02:16:18.138]  You know, people in the CIA, at lower- you know, not the high-level positions, but in the secondary positions, they're the ones that move forward on all this stuff.
[02:16:18.138 --> 02:16:28.027]  The wars, every- all the dirty stuff that goes on, so that by the time our elected politicians are briefed on it, this thing's already halfway to life.
[02:16:28.027 --> 02:16:29.108]  It's already happening.
[02:16:29.958 --> 02:16:34.084]  So they really, our politicians are playing catch up.
[02:16:34.084 --> 02:16:38.830]  And that's what Prouty explains in that book, The Secret Team.
[02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:40.512]  That's who The Secret Team is.
[02:16:41.849 --> 02:16:48.035]  The secret team are these right-under-level government people who are literally running amok.
[02:16:48.035 --> 02:16:49.897]  And there's nobody in control of them.
[02:16:49.897 --> 02:16:58.605]  And, uh, you know, the CIA has its own money now, and own money sources, so they can basically do anything they want.
[02:16:58.605 --> 02:17:02.049]  And our president and the rest of them seem to be powerless to them.
[02:17:02.503 --> 02:17:05.304]  Well, that's what Ron Paul said two months ago in a speech.
[02:17:05.304 --> 02:17:06.304]  In fact, we'll cue that up.
[02:17:06.304 --> 02:17:07.424]  It's about 20 seconds.
[02:17:07.424 --> 02:17:09.985]  He said, we've had a CIA coup since the 60s.
[02:17:09.985 --> 02:17:11.365]  They're bringing in the drugs.
[02:17:11.365 --> 02:17:12.785]  We have a shadow government.
[02:17:12.785 --> 02:17:27.569]  And my whole point is, we have to come to the point as a nation to realize presidents come and go, but the secret teams run by the big Wall Street banks that set up the CIA rule this country, and by extension, the world.
[02:17:27.569 --> 02:17:28.509]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:17:30.879 --> 02:17:35.261]  At least that's the information that I'm arriving at.
[02:17:35.261 --> 02:17:38.682]  It's not a nice arrival, but you know, what can we do?
[02:17:38.682 --> 02:17:43.925]  Well, I've been harping on it for about 12 years, Alex.
[02:17:43.925 --> 02:17:48.367]  You can start by stop voting for Democrats and Republicans.
[02:17:48.367 --> 02:17:49.807]  I don't care who you vote for.
[02:17:49.807 --> 02:17:51.508]  Don't vote for them.
[02:17:51.508 --> 02:17:52.388]  They're the problem.
[02:17:52.388 --> 02:17:53.409]  They're not the solution.
[02:17:55.211 --> 02:17:58.112]  And that's, you know, really, it gets to that.
[02:17:58.112 --> 02:18:00.673]  Then, of course, you have to question, is the voting real?
[02:18:00.673 --> 02:18:11.156]  Because with these electronic voting machines, they can be hacked into, so you've got to question whether your votes are actually legitimate even in this country anymore.
[02:18:11.156 --> 02:18:12.656]  Exactly.
[02:18:12.656 --> 02:18:15.457]  Let me back you up, what you just said.
[02:18:15.457 --> 02:18:16.677]  You take Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:18:16.677 --> 02:18:22.979]  I sat through many hours of LBJ at his ranch outside Austin, Johnson City, a couple miles from where I sit.
[02:18:24.002 --> 02:18:25.663]  Exactly, and you gotta understand, too, it ain't McNamara.
[02:18:25.663 --> 02:18:26.903]  McNamara's being briefed, too.
[02:18:48.183 --> 02:18:50.964]  He probably only learned about it the week ahead of LBJ.
[02:18:50.964 --> 02:18:51.325]  Yep.
[02:18:51.325 --> 02:18:52.485]  And see, he's been briefed.
[02:18:52.485 --> 02:18:55.567]  See, Fletcher Prouty said the key to all of this are these briefer guys.
[02:19:07.818 --> 02:19:19.323]  These guys that the Pentagon has and the CIA have, who do the briefings of the politicians, they're the ones who sell the politician on the policy.
[02:19:19.323 --> 02:19:20.804]  And it comes from them.
[02:19:20.804 --> 02:19:24.125]  Yeah, well, that's what Fletcher Prouty said, and I haven't found a thing he's been wrong with yet.
[02:19:37.515 --> 02:19:45.442]  Always wise, always informed, but just to know that he is really on the fast track to the key of planetary control.
[02:19:45.442 --> 02:19:47.284]  It's all staged.
[02:19:47.284 --> 02:19:48.105]  In the past it was.
[02:19:48.105 --> 02:19:50.267]  There is a split between Russia now, it appears.
[02:19:50.267 --> 02:19:54.491]  But in the past, all rigged, two empires carving up the world.
[02:19:54.491 --> 02:19:56.393]  We'll be right back with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:20:04.591 --> 02:20:10.893]  As the economy continues to decline, Patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[02:20:10.893 --> 02:20:13.114]  The world is changing fast.
[02:20:13.114 --> 02:20:15.355]  Are you fully prepared?
[02:20:15.355 --> 02:20:18.556]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[02:20:18.556 --> 02:20:29.280]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:32.822]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer
[02:20:33.963 --> 02:20:40.628]  50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[02:20:40.628 --> 02:20:45.471]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[02:20:45.471 --> 02:20:50.095]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:20:50.095 --> 02:20:53.037]  Food insurance, just in case.
[02:20:53.037 --> 02:20:55.119]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb.
[02:21:00.325 --> 02:21:03.287]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:21:03.287 --> 02:21:07.449]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:21:07.449 --> 02:21:09.710]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:14.873]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:21:14.873 --> 02:21:16.694]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:21:16.694 --> 02:21:18.235]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:21:18.235 --> 02:21:19.716]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:21:19.716 --> 02:21:22.758]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:21:23.078 --> 02:21:28.463]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:28.463 --> 02:21:37.791]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[02:21:37.791 --> 02:21:40.133]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:21:42.955 --> 02:21:46.439]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[02:21:59.901 --> 02:22:02.304]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:02.304 --> 02:22:04.607]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:04.607 --> 02:22:07.830]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:12.936]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:12.936 --> 02:22:17.141]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:17.441 --> 02:22:19.785]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:19.785 --> 02:22:22.349]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:25.593]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:25.593 --> 02:22:33.185]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:33.525 --> 02:22:38.908]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:38.908 --> 02:22:41.769]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:41.769 --> 02:22:45.451]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:45.451 --> 02:22:46.531]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:46.531 --> 02:22:47.872]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:47.872 --> 02:22:49.373]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:59.096 --> 02:23:00.877]  Great news for pure water lovers!

[02:23:24.392 --> 02:23:29.513]  They remove harmful pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy chemicals like chlorine.
[02:23:29.513 --> 02:23:35.935]  And Berkey water filter systems are powerful enough to purify both treated and untreated water, like stagnant ponds.

[02:24:19.902 --> 02:24:21.843]  You have really seemed happy.
[02:24:21.843 --> 02:24:23.404]  Why are you so happy?
[02:24:23.404 --> 02:24:26.406]  Mexico does that to me, Alex.
[02:24:26.406 --> 02:24:30.888]  When I get down there, you know, I spent Friday and Saturday, the waves were great.
[02:24:30.888 --> 02:24:35.571]  They were running about three, three and a half feet, and they were coming in perfect for surfing.
[02:24:35.571 --> 02:24:38.752]  So I had two great days of surfing down there.
[02:24:38.752 --> 02:24:45.016]  And whenever I can live that lifestyle, I get very content and very pleased with the world.
[02:24:45.888 --> 02:24:46.789]  I hear you.
[02:24:46.789 --> 02:24:50.430]  And first you have the tsunami and then the earthquake, but no problems.
[02:24:50.430 --> 02:24:52.231]  No, I didn't even feel the earthquake.
[02:24:52.231 --> 02:24:57.454]  The earthquake happened way up by Mexicali, which is right on the border of Mexico and California.
[02:24:57.454 --> 02:25:02.116]  Oh, I do want to, here's one thing when we talk that, Alex, that I wanted to word out to people on.
[02:25:02.116 --> 02:25:04.337]  Please allow me to do it here.
[02:25:04.337 --> 02:25:12.621]  Everyone out there that knows anyone in the state of California, please encourage them this fall to vote for the legalization of marijuana.
[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:16.701]  It's gonna be on the ballot in California.
[02:25:16.701 --> 02:25:21.422]  Full legalization to where marijuana would be treated like alcohol and tobacco.
[02:25:21.422 --> 02:25:28.143]  And the reason I'm pleading with people to support this is to stop the carnage at the border.
[02:25:28.143 --> 02:25:30.804]  Alex, it's awful.
[02:25:30.804 --> 02:25:32.884]  17,000 people have died on the Mexican-U.S.
[02:25:32.884 --> 02:25:34.285]  border just in the last year.
[02:25:34.285 --> 02:25:35.125]  I know.
[02:25:35.125 --> 02:25:36.205]  It's a war zone.
[02:25:37.602 --> 02:25:38.482]  We can end it.
[02:25:38.482 --> 02:25:41.323]  We can end it by simply legalizing.
[02:25:41.323 --> 02:25:43.684]  Because that puts the cartels out of business.
[02:25:43.684 --> 02:25:45.324]  They have nothing to sell them.
[02:25:45.324 --> 02:25:46.565]  But that's common sense.
[02:25:46.565 --> 02:25:49.265]  All these fake conservatives say, that's of the devil.
[02:25:49.265 --> 02:25:56.448]  Meanwhile, the CIA wants to keep all the drugs illegal so they have an excuse to put people in prison and so they can launder the money.
[02:25:56.448 --> 02:25:57.008]  Exactly.
[02:25:59.267 --> 02:26:01.448]  We've got it in the palm of our hand, Alex.
[02:26:01.448 --> 02:26:10.711]  If the election's legitimate out in California, the people out there can vote for the first step to full legalization of marijuana.
[02:26:10.711 --> 02:26:15.593]  And I think if you see California do it, it'll go like wildfire right across the country.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:17.261]  Absolutely.
[02:26:17.261 --> 02:26:19.442]  So you heard it here, folks.
[02:26:19.442 --> 02:26:24.126]  Vote for the decriminalization, legalization of marijuana in California.
[02:26:24.126 --> 02:26:25.427]  Here's a Reuters article.
[02:26:25.427 --> 02:26:28.909]  NATO rejects Russian call for Afghan poppy spraying.
[02:26:28.909 --> 02:26:39.997]  NATO Wednesday rejected Russian calls for it to eradicate opium poppy fields in Afghanistan, saying the best way for Moscow to help control the drug would be to give more assistance against the insurgency.
[02:26:39.997 --> 02:26:41.899]  Then I was listening to BBC a few months ago.
[02:26:42.888 --> 02:26:44.649]  And they were admitting that the U.S.
[02:26:44.649 --> 02:26:53.552]  protects the opium to be friends with the locals, and it's up more than twelve times what it was nine years ago, and there's opium flooding the world right now.
[02:26:53.552 --> 02:26:57.973]  What's your take on government drug dealing, and that they're openly protecting the poppy fields?
[02:26:57.973 --> 02:27:01.134]  Well, you know, look at it this way, Alex.
[02:27:01.134 --> 02:27:11.238]  The major banks, the international banks of the world, where do you think all that money gets those millions and billions of dollars for the heroin trade gets laundered through?
[02:27:12.058 --> 02:27:14.160]  And look at the timing of it.
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:21.426]  The Wall Street crash happened right at the time the Taliban put the poppy growers out of business.
[02:27:21.426 --> 02:27:22.046]  Yep.
[02:27:22.046 --> 02:27:25.329]  Because all of it, and there may be a correlation there.
[02:27:25.329 --> 02:27:28.572]  You're talking about 2000-2001.
[02:27:28.572 --> 02:27:34.677]  These billions of dollars of laundered drug money, and that could very well have hurt the cash flow of these banks.
[02:27:35.643 --> 02:27:37.084]  And that very well could have been.
[02:27:37.084 --> 02:27:46.552]  I'm not saying it's the full thing, but it certainly could have been part of the catalyst that made the Wall Street crash happen in 08.
[02:27:46.552 --> 02:27:52.918]  Well, there's also the fact that the Taliban was cutting it off in 2000-2001, and you had the crash in 2001.
[02:27:52.918 --> 02:27:53.058]  Yep.
[02:27:53.058 --> 02:28:01.025]  Notice how every time the drugs get cut off, it seems Wall Street crashes shortly thereafter.
[02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:08.259]  Well, you're right on that front again, but how can they just be in Reuters saying, we're not going to eradicate any poppy fields?
[02:28:08.259 --> 02:28:12.043]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[02:28:12.043 --> 02:28:15.486]  Well, it's the old thing of the way we fight the wars today.
[02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:20.331]  You know, sometimes the people you get in bed with are worse than the people you're fighting.
[02:28:21.889 --> 02:28:24.050]  You're absolutely right.
[02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:33.253]  Governor Jesse Ventura, I have a lot of questions that I want to ask here on my list, but going out to break on this short segment, what else do you want to relay to this audience that you think is important?
[02:28:33.253 --> 02:28:41.976]  Well, again, just to be vigilant and pay attention and question your government at all times, because it needs to be questioned.
[02:28:41.976 --> 02:28:45.477]  Right now, like I said, it should be clear to everyone that
[02:28:45.857 --> 02:28:48.478]  Barack Obama's not in charge.
[02:28:48.478 --> 02:28:50.319]  I don't believe that he is now.
[02:28:50.319 --> 02:28:55.281]  Because you see, everything that he ran on, he hasn't come through on virtually anything.
[02:28:55.281 --> 02:28:58.082]  He's now in the opposite camp, really.
[02:28:58.082 --> 02:29:08.207]  And it's almost like he arrived there with this fresh, clean agenda, and it was like they took him to the woodshed and told him, well, you might be the president, but you don't run things.
[02:29:10.461 --> 02:29:15.502]  Well certainly, plus they finance him, they finance McCain, no matter who gets in, they control him.
[02:29:15.502 --> 02:29:16.603]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:29:16.603 --> 02:29:22.344]  You know, you look at Obama's biggest contributor was Goldman Sachs.
[02:29:22.344 --> 02:29:29.446]  And they're the ones that, what is it, the last five or six Department of Treasury secretaries have all come out of there?
[02:29:29.446 --> 02:29:32.667]  And absolutely, and then you look at Chile, Iceland,
[02:29:34.109 --> 02:29:41.656]  You look at Greece, you look at all these countries, first world, second world, they're all run by Goldman Sachs people.
[02:29:41.656 --> 02:29:43.657]  That's the key heart to this group.
[02:29:43.657 --> 02:29:47.361]  A ton of questions straight ahead for Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:29:47.361 --> 02:29:48.602]  The book is a bestseller.
[02:29:48.602 --> 02:29:51.364]  Get it at InfoWars.com and get your choice.
[02:29:51.364 --> 02:29:55.307]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.307 --> 02:29:57.990]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.970 --> 02:30:02.272]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.272 --> 02:30:07.858]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:30:07.858 --> 02:30:12.885]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:30:12.885 --> 02:30:17.911]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:30:18.431 --> 02:30:23.673]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:30:23.673 --> 02:30:30.776]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:30:30.776 --> 02:30:31.896]  And here's the best part.
[02:30:31.896 --> 02:30:38.259]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[02:30:45.105 --> 02:30:48.568]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:30:48.568 --> 02:30:50.310]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:02.503 --> 02:31:06.464]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.464 --> 02:31:15.325]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.325 --> 02:31:19.946]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:19.946 --> 02:31:30.768]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.

[02:32:04.608 --> 02:32:05.868]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.868 --> 02:32:09.809]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.809 --> 02:32:12.029]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.029 --> 02:32:17.891]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:32:17.891 --> 02:32:24.112]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.552 --> 02:32:30.554]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.554 --> 02:32:34.715]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.715 --> 02:32:39.016]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:39.016 --> 02:32:44.958]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.958 --> 02:32:48.519]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.519 --> 02:32:50.480]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:50.920]  It's here.

[02:33:09.341 --> 02:33:15.043]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, Tuesday, the 6th day of April, 2010.
[02:33:15.043 --> 02:33:24.226]  Governor Jesse Ventura, an icon of true political independence in this country and worldwide, is our guest, and I'm really honored to have him and honored to count him as a friend.
[02:33:24.226 --> 02:33:25.087]  He's a great guy.
[02:33:25.087 --> 02:33:25.727]  He's for real.
[02:33:26.267 --> 02:33:29.149]  And I want to get into how did he get his TV show on air?
[02:33:29.149 --> 02:33:36.953]  We talked about this last time and he marveled, but now we see the censorship of his book, no book reviews even though it's number four on the New York Times bestseller list.
[02:33:36.953 --> 02:33:37.954]  How did that happen?
[02:33:37.954 --> 02:33:39.254]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[02:33:39.254 --> 02:33:53.122]  But first, Governor, I got an email from a lady saying, effective immediately, she's never listening to my radio show again because I played the gun pod footage from the Apaches killing these reporters, shooting these kids, laughing about it.
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:57.323]  And then lying about it later, all these other massacre videos.
[02:33:57.323 --> 02:33:58.965]  Here's the New York Times today.
[02:33:58.965 --> 02:33:59.245]  U.S.
[02:33:59.245 --> 02:34:02.808]  forces horrifying Afghanistan cover-up.
[02:34:02.808 --> 02:34:09.153]  Obviously, we're not saying the individual troops are all bad, but Pat Tillman went over there, found that it was a fraud, wrote letters home.
[02:34:09.153 --> 02:34:10.294]  That's a show you should do.
[02:34:10.294 --> 02:34:11.335]  I talked to some of his family.
[02:34:11.335 --> 02:34:12.056]  They wouldn't come on air.
[02:34:12.056 --> 02:34:13.337]  They believe it was a hit.
[02:34:13.337 --> 02:34:15.619]  The evidence came out they did cover up the friendly fire.
[02:34:15.619 --> 02:34:18.642]  They killed him up at point-blank range, three shots in the head.
[02:34:19.662 --> 02:34:28.985]  I mean, as Fletcher Pouty wrote, and he ran black ops, we propped up the Soviets, we set it all up, it's staged, it's eating our entire system.
[02:34:28.985 --> 02:34:33.226]  Is it unpatriotic to criticize corrupt, illegal wars?
[02:34:33.226 --> 02:34:34.666]  No, it's not.
[02:34:34.666 --> 02:34:36.827]  You know, we went through this in Vietnam.
[02:34:36.827 --> 02:34:40.948]  I would think that this country would have a little bit longer memory.
[02:34:42.317 --> 02:34:47.940]  The same type of affair took place in Vietnam, where you had the massacre at My Lai.
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:53.764]  You know, people, and believe me, I'm not blaming the soldiers, I'm blaming the politicians.
[02:34:54.779 --> 02:34:57.341]  Because it's ultimately their fault.
[02:34:57.341 --> 02:35:02.606]  You know, war is the result of failed policy, failed politics.
[02:35:02.606 --> 02:35:04.788]  And the end result is war.
[02:35:04.788 --> 02:35:09.593]  And so when your politicians fail you, you go to war.
[02:35:09.593 --> 02:35:14.577]  And because of their failure, they put our young men and women into these wars.
[02:35:15.878 --> 02:35:21.300]  What they did, of course, what they did is not good, but let's remember something.
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:26.202]  Some of these guys are on their 5th, 6th, and 7th tour over there.
[02:35:26.202 --> 02:35:27.542]  They've been hardened now.
[02:35:27.542 --> 02:35:28.843]  They've been changed.
[02:35:28.843 --> 02:35:31.484]  They are not the same people that left.
[02:35:31.484 --> 02:35:33.404]  Trust me on that.
[02:35:33.404 --> 02:35:38.706]  And so, war, there is nothing great and glorious about war.
[02:35:38.706 --> 02:35:41.287]  War is the worst thing man's ever come up with.
[02:35:42.446 --> 02:35:44.649]  And that's killing each other over what?
[02:35:44.649 --> 02:35:46.032]  Political reasons?
[02:35:46.032 --> 02:35:47.113]  Religion?
[02:35:47.113 --> 02:35:52.001]  Whatever stupidity we might decide to go to war and murder each other over?
[02:35:52.885 --> 02:36:00.347]  And so, no, you are not wrong in showing this because what's wrong is sheltering people from it.
[02:36:00.347 --> 02:36:12.251]  That's why these wars are going on, Alex, is because the American people have been sheltered, the media is not portraying what's happening over there, and they're not even showing the body bags when they come home.
[02:36:14.079 --> 02:36:39.457]  Well, you're absolutely right, and you talked about Fletcher Prouty, who ran Black Ops in the Pentagon, that's on record the liaison to the CIA, and he's documenting how they made the decision at the end of World War II to attack third world countries, to divide them, to never have an outcome, so the armaments industries could make a lot of money and get a lot of power, and then we sit here and say that's exactly what Afghanistan and Iraq are.
[02:36:39.457 --> 02:36:41.679]  We know this is the policy of divide and conquer.
[02:36:42.199 --> 02:36:55.949]  We know they're turning our country into a militarized surveillance police state, and it's our right as citizens to say that we don't want to be part of these illegal wars that George Washington said that we shouldn't be involved in foreign wars.
[02:36:55.949 --> 02:37:01.933]  Well, again, I guess sometimes a war is justified, you know?
[02:37:01.933 --> 02:37:11.360]  There are occasions, you know, where a war you've got to go fight because there may be a tyrant like Adolf Hitler out there, and that type of situation.
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:17.956]  But, ever since World War II, you cannot tell me one word that has been justified.
[02:37:18.692 --> 02:37:21.494]  But you talked about it being a failed policy.
[02:37:21.494 --> 02:37:28.117]  Failed from our perspective, but if we know they're premeditated to be quagmires to make money, then it's not a failed policy.
[02:37:28.117 --> 02:37:35.922]  You know, they say the war on drugs is a failure, there's more drugs, more people in prison, but for the big banks and the military-industrial complex, that's a success.
[02:37:35.922 --> 02:37:38.683]  Oh yeah, very much so.
[02:37:38.683 --> 02:37:42.545]  People need to always remember there are profiteers at war.
[02:37:42.545 --> 02:37:47.288]  There are people that wait for war because they become exceptionally wealthy.
[02:37:48.516 --> 02:37:59.342]  When there's wars fought, and these are the people that lead, these are the lobbyists that get those secret team guys at that level of government to move forward.
[02:37:59.342 --> 02:38:02.223]  Here's what Prouty also brings out very clearly.
[02:38:02.223 --> 02:38:05.705]  He brings out the fraud of the CIA.
[02:38:05.705 --> 02:38:10.267]  We all believe the CIA is there to gather intelligence, right?
[02:38:10.267 --> 02:38:10.867]  Yes.
[02:38:10.867 --> 02:38:12.988]  Well, Prouty says that's about 10% of what they do.
[02:38:14.794 --> 02:38:19.910]  The other 90% is carrying out these military agendas and creating the roars.
[02:38:20.655 --> 02:38:21.936]  And assassinations.
[02:38:21.936 --> 02:38:24.157]  Yeah, well that's what helps create the wars.
[02:38:24.157 --> 02:38:30.501]  See, they were designed by Harry Truman to not set policy.
[02:38:30.501 --> 02:38:35.844]  They were supposedly to be there only to provide information for the President.
[02:38:35.844 --> 02:38:48.352]  And Allen Dulles, I'm proud he makes it very clear that Allen Dulles, and of course he's neck deep a member of the Warren Commission and all that on Kennedy, Allen Dulles is the one that created today's CIA.
[02:38:49.913 --> 02:38:51.874]  Where do you see this going?
[02:38:51.874 --> 02:38:56.799]  Because I have a Bloomberg report here in my stack where the federal government is telling
[02:39:11.323 --> 02:39:13.125]  I believe they're trying to destroy the middle class.
[02:39:13.125 --> 02:39:15.667]  Because we're the only country that's ever really had one.
[02:39:36.167 --> 02:39:44.369]  That's always been the American dream, is that you can rise from poverty in this country and you can become a millionaire.
[02:39:44.369 --> 02:39:47.670]  Well, that dream is vanishing quickly.
[02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:52.271]  There is not going to be a middle class in about 15 years, I don't believe.
[02:39:52.271 --> 02:39:54.331]  There will just be rich and poor.
[02:39:54.331 --> 02:39:57.972]  And therefore, we will be like every other country around the globe.
[02:39:57.972 --> 02:40:02.433]  And maybe, Alex, it's being done to globalize Mexico, Canada, and us.
[02:40:03.314 --> 02:40:05.555]  Absolutely, North American Union.
[02:40:05.555 --> 02:40:09.936]  That way people are so poor they can't ever resist the ruling class.
[02:40:09.936 --> 02:40:10.976]  Here's that Bloomberg article.
[02:40:10.976 --> 02:40:13.937]  They gotta bring us down to Mexico's level.
[02:40:13.937 --> 02:40:14.677]  Oh, exactly.
[02:40:14.677 --> 02:40:15.677]  That's what the globalists say.
[02:40:15.677 --> 02:40:23.319]  In fact, there's a clip we have of Obama where he says, in this new world order, no nation can be above another.
[02:40:23.319 --> 02:40:26.040]  But that doesn't mean raise the third world.
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:28.741]  In the globalist documents, they want to lower everybody.
[02:40:28.741 --> 02:40:32.262]  Yeah, no, they would rather lower us down to the third world level.
[02:40:33.127 --> 02:40:33.689]  Unbelievable!
[02:40:37.481 --> 02:40:40.403]  Let's read this Bloomberg headline for folks that are doubting me.
[02:40:40.403 --> 02:40:44.065]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[02:40:44.065 --> 02:40:56.773]  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is trying to encourage public retirement funds that control more than $2 trillion to buy all or part of failed lenders' assets, taking on a more direct role in propping up banking systems.
[02:40:56.773 --> 02:40:59.195]  And it talks about how the regulators are ordering them to do it.
[02:40:59.195 --> 02:41:05.539]  Since when do regulators order private and public pension funds to be invested in the failed banks?
[02:41:12.056 --> 02:41:15.499]  Well, the government says, Jesse, they want to grab your 401k and give it to the bankers.
[02:41:25.751 --> 02:41:28.153]  Well, I know they've been setting up for it and infiltrating.
[02:41:28.153 --> 02:41:41.784]  I know they infiltrated these militias and set them up to create the illusion that there's about to be all this domestic terror, and I believe they're getting ready to stage terror attacks, Governor, to blame it on the American people, to use NORTHCOM against the American people.
[02:41:41.784 --> 02:41:42.364]  So that what?
[02:41:42.364 --> 02:41:46.427]  They could empower themselves into a Marshall Lab-type situation?
[02:41:46.427 --> 02:41:53.213]  I know they've been making preparations for two decades in earnest, starting with Oliver North, and I know I've never seen such a build-up towards it.
[02:41:53.789 --> 02:41:54.750]  Okay.
[02:41:54.750 --> 02:41:58.153]  Well, it's something we all gotta be aware of.
[02:41:58.153 --> 02:41:59.014]  Without a doubt.
[02:41:59.014 --> 02:42:05.681]  But, you know, there's still us, all the masses out there, and we're still very powerful.
[02:42:05.681 --> 02:42:08.644]  The only thing is, we have to learn to use our power.
[02:42:08.644 --> 02:42:12.908]  Well, you've got a powerful voice as a political icon, an independent, a former governor.
[02:42:13.926 --> 02:42:25.357]  What would you say to the American people if we see some terror attacks, they're blamed on the American people, and they start trying to use these different enemy combatant acts, belligerent acts, to start grabbing U.S.
[02:42:25.357 --> 02:42:26.378]  citizens?
[02:42:26.378 --> 02:42:30.642]  Well, you know, I think the first thing we need to do is this.
[02:42:30.642 --> 02:42:37.308]  I think we need to put huge pressure on the Obama administration to rescind the Patriot Act.
[02:42:37.819 --> 02:42:38.700]  Yes.
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:46.506]  I think that would be the great starting point for people to start marching and demanding that the Patriot Act be abolished.
[02:42:48.554 --> 02:43:08.988]  The Patriot Act is the thing that's taking away our freedoms, it's taking away habeas corpus, where they can arrest you, simply say you committed a terrorist act, you can't get a lawyer, they can hold you without a trial, and people in this country better wake up because what they're doing to them guys at Guantanamo, down at Gitmo, they could do to you.
[02:43:10.199 --> 02:43:15.964]  Well that's what the Belligerent Act states that John McCain's introduced and Lindsey Graham's supporting.
[02:43:15.964 --> 02:43:24.651]  It says for any intelligence reason or any direction of the President, citizens can be grabbed and given enhanced interrogation and never be seen again.
[02:43:24.651 --> 02:43:25.451]  I'm not kidding.
[02:43:25.451 --> 02:43:28.314]  I even had Judge Napolitano... John McCain?
[02:43:28.314 --> 02:43:28.954]  Absolutely.
[02:43:31.184 --> 02:43:32.504]  Guys, print the belligerent act.
[02:43:32.504 --> 02:43:34.725]  I want to read Governor Ventura the actual passage.
[02:43:34.725 --> 02:43:37.866]  Yes, sir, and I had Judge Napolitano on as a former federal judge.
[02:43:37.866 --> 02:43:39.066]  Sure.
[02:43:39.066 --> 02:43:49.970]  And he pointed out, it says that the fact that you've been grabbed is a secret unless the House and Senate Intelligence Committee vote to allow it to be known you've even been grabbed.
[02:43:49.970 --> 02:43:51.530]  Really?
[02:43:51.530 --> 02:43:55.612]  Well, then let me say this on your show, Alex.
[02:43:55.612 --> 02:43:58.132]  I will never disappear by my own choice.
[02:44:00.988 --> 02:44:01.849]  Good point.
[02:44:01.849 --> 02:44:12.095]  So, I've said it now on your show, so everybody knows that if Jesse Ventura suddenly disappears, they'll know that I wouldn't do that.
[02:44:12.095 --> 02:44:15.678]  Other than to go surfing in Mexico and you know that I'll come back every spring.
[02:44:17.409 --> 02:44:19.430]  Well, I tell you, that brings me to the next question.
[02:44:19.430 --> 02:44:29.434]  I mean, as things heat up, as you become even more prominent, if that's possible, but you are, and as people's respect for you goes even higher, we need to take good care of you.
[02:44:29.434 --> 02:44:34.617]  So watch out there aren't some frogmen out there when you're surfing that try to make you disappear.
[02:44:34.617 --> 02:44:38.959]  Be careful, I hope you're strapping a sidearm or at least a speargun when you're out there.
[02:44:38.959 --> 02:44:46.162]  Nah, you know, I've always been a pretty good swimmer, Alex, and I can take care of myself in the water.
[02:44:47.873 --> 02:44:52.734]  And I truly don't believe any of my COT mates would do that to me.
[02:44:52.734 --> 02:44:53.955]  No, I don't think they wouldn't either.
[02:44:53.955 --> 02:44:56.736]  I really don't believe that would happen.
[02:44:56.736 --> 02:45:01.897]  And so, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.
[02:45:01.897 --> 02:45:06.478]  It's just a case, again, where we've got to keep talking.
[02:45:06.478 --> 02:45:13.740]  Like that lady that sent you that thing, I have sympathy for her son, who's over there fighting, because it's our fault.
[02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:15.621]  People need to understand this, also.
[02:45:16.667 --> 02:45:20.395]  We can end all these wars by bringing the draft back.
[02:45:20.395 --> 02:45:24.463]  And I used to be on the Abolish the Draft movement after Vietnam.
[02:45:24.463 --> 02:45:27.990]  But now I realize that the professional military is a mistake.
[02:45:28.874 --> 02:45:30.975]  Because the problem is this.
[02:45:30.975 --> 02:45:36.918]  When you get a professional military like we have, we the public are then not vigilant.
[02:45:36.918 --> 02:45:45.182]  We need to be vigilant to never send those young men and women into harm's way unless it is absolutely essential.
[02:45:45.182 --> 02:45:47.083]  Well now we've got a mercenary army.
[02:45:47.083 --> 02:45:48.744]  I think we should ban that first.
[02:45:49.524 --> 02:45:50.746]  I totally agree.
[02:45:50.746 --> 02:45:52.668]  You've got to get rid of these mercenaries.
[02:45:52.668 --> 02:45:54.730]  You've got to get rid of Blackwater.
[02:45:54.730 --> 02:46:00.917]  You've got to get rid of all of them groups because there's actually more mercenaries in Iraq today than there are soldiers.
[02:46:01.445 --> 02:46:26.451]  Well, I've talked to Anthony Schaeffer, Special Forces Colonel Commander, and he talked about how the CIA wouldn't let him kill Bin Laden two weeks before 9-11, and he said that was being done because they already had contractors in the CIA with more power than the Army and the Navy, and that they basically are above the law and can do whatever they want, so... Well, in Crowdy's book you'll find out the CIA runs our military.
[02:46:26.451 --> 02:46:30.792]  Our military is used to back up whatever the CIA is getting involved with.
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:35.842]  Well, that's what Colonel Schaefer says, yeah.
[02:46:35.842 --> 02:46:38.223]  Oh yeah, Pardee says it too.
[02:46:38.223 --> 02:46:41.444]  Well, he might be good to interview Anthony Schaefer.
[02:46:41.444 --> 02:46:43.925]  He's on Fox and MSNBC and CNN, all of them.
[02:46:43.925 --> 02:46:46.026]  Let me read this to you, just so it's on record.
[02:46:46.026 --> 02:46:49.748]  In fact, here's the bill, right here, racing through the Senate right now.
[02:46:49.748 --> 02:46:52.969]  The sinner is to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[02:46:52.969 --> 02:46:54.770]  The full bill can be read here.
[02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:58.552]  A person is considered a high-value detainee if they fulfill one of the following criteria.
[02:46:59.258 --> 02:47:00.739]  Alex, torture you to do what?
[02:47:25.367 --> 02:47:27.288]  I guess to say you're guilty.
[02:47:27.288 --> 02:47:27.928]  Well, I don't know.
[02:47:27.928 --> 02:47:31.630]  Okay, let's say hypothetically they grabbed me.
[02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:36.533]  What would they torture me to find out?
[02:47:36.533 --> 02:47:37.313]  That's the whole point.
[02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:40.855]  They only torture for terror and to get false confessions.
[02:47:40.855 --> 02:47:43.836]  Okay, so I'd have to confess to something then, right?
[02:47:43.836 --> 02:47:44.617]  Yes.
[02:47:44.617 --> 02:47:45.477]  Okay.
[02:47:45.477 --> 02:47:46.758]  That's what I was interested in.
[02:47:46.758 --> 02:47:50.340]  Why on earth would they pick someone and then torture them?
[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:51.100]  For what purpose?
[02:47:52.048 --> 02:47:56.973]  Well now, if we ever have another big war and people torture our troops, how can we say it's wrong?
[02:47:56.973 --> 02:47:58.655]  We can't.
[02:47:58.655 --> 02:48:03.080]  We haven't been able to do that since Abu Ghraib and Gitmo.
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:04.281]  We can't, we can't.
[02:48:04.281 --> 02:48:08.226]  You know, let me throw this out for your listeners to understand this too, Alex.
[02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:19.676]  You know, we in the United States, and let me reiterate, my father's a World War II vet, my mother's a World War II vet, my brother and I are both Vietnam vets.
[02:48:19.676 --> 02:48:23.258]  I say that because of what I'm going to tell you now.
[02:48:23.258 --> 02:48:27.480]  We in the United States have been practicing terrorism for 50 years.
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:29.681]  We just call it foreign policy.
[02:48:29.681 --> 02:48:30.502]  Yes.
[02:48:30.502 --> 02:48:32.963]  Because we've been terrorizing Cuba.
[02:48:32.963 --> 02:48:35.925]  We've attempted to kill Castro on multiple occasions.
[02:48:36.805 --> 02:48:46.307]  We've ruined their cane fields, we've attempted to destroy their economy, and now do you know about this character Orlando Bosch?
[02:48:46.307 --> 02:48:47.487]  Tell folks about it.
[02:48:47.487 --> 02:48:54.108]  Well, Orlando Bosch was a guy who blew up, blew up a civilian Cuban airliner.
[02:48:54.108 --> 02:48:57.609]  Bore the CIA and got protected.
[02:48:57.609 --> 02:48:59.689]  No, there were 73 people on board.
[02:48:59.689 --> 02:49:02.169]  Now is that not an act of terrorism?
[02:49:02.169 --> 02:49:02.509]  It is.
[02:49:02.509 --> 02:49:05.410]  Well, this senior pardoned him.
[02:49:05.410 --> 02:49:05.610]  Yes.
[02:49:07.307 --> 02:49:13.209]  This guy that blew up a plane with 73 people on it.
[02:49:13.209 --> 02:49:23.952]  In fact, we need to realize that we need to take our heads out of the sand, the citizens of the United States of America, and start realizing, think of it this way.
[02:49:23.952 --> 02:49:28.933]  Why do we have to spend so much money on our defense budget?
[02:49:28.933 --> 02:49:30.874]  Who's after us and for what reason?
[02:49:32.426 --> 02:49:35.048]  What are we protecting ourselves from?
[02:49:35.048 --> 02:49:39.512]  Obviously, we haven't behaved very well throughout the world.
[02:49:39.512 --> 02:49:49.761]  Because clearly, if we're in such danger that literally half of our money and our taxes have to go to defense spending, what does that tell you?
[02:49:49.761 --> 02:49:59.509]  Well, I wanted to add that that individual you mentioned we cover in Terror Storm, it's declassified that he blew up a plane full of the Olympic team for the Cubans.
[02:49:59.509 --> 02:49:59.689]  Yeah.
[02:50:00.473 --> 02:50:15.718]  So, so, again, and then there really isn't many people attacking us, so the military industrial complex goes out and finances terror groups or stages attacks as the pretext to ratchet up the naked body scanners and the face scanners and the control.
[02:50:15.718 --> 02:50:19.099]  Yeah, maybe well, you may well be right on that.
[02:50:19.099 --> 02:50:24.200]  Because again, you know, we've been practicing terrorism for 50 years.
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:25.841]  We just call it foreign policy.
[02:50:27.065 --> 02:50:27.746]  You know?
[02:50:27.746 --> 02:50:32.492]  I mean, look at all the people we've tried to assassinate down in Central America.
[02:50:32.492 --> 02:50:35.095]  That's not terrorism?
[02:50:35.095 --> 02:50:45.369]  When you go in and attempt, just because a country has a different form of government than you have, what gives us the right to go into that country and attempt to assassinate their leader?
[02:50:46.348 --> 02:50:48.470]  Well, if they tried it here, they'd be called terrorists.
[02:50:48.470 --> 02:50:50.351]  I'm skipping this network break.
[02:50:50.351 --> 02:50:52.393]  We've got about nine minutes left with Jesse Ventura.
[02:50:52.393 --> 02:50:53.674]  This is a network break.
[02:50:53.674 --> 02:50:55.656]  We're skipping it, not station break.
[02:50:55.656 --> 02:50:58.638]  Just a word to everybody out there who's just joined us.
[02:50:58.638 --> 02:51:01.480]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:08.166]  I want to encourage all the listeners to not procrastinate and get Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies at Infowars.com.
[02:51:08.166 --> 02:51:11.709]  You can get the book, $5 off the book and hardcover, and then get
[02:51:12.873 --> 02:51:12.953]  The
[02:51:31.425 --> 02:51:35.427]  Your television show, when is it going to be back on the airwaves?
[02:51:35.427 --> 02:51:40.410]  Can you give us any view into what some of the episodes may be about?
[02:51:40.410 --> 02:51:44.432]  Alex, right now we're just ramping up.
[02:51:44.432 --> 02:51:46.233]  They just got the budget approved.
[02:51:46.233 --> 02:51:49.935]  My son is finally, I think he'll get a paycheck next week.
[02:51:49.935 --> 02:51:51.796]  So that means it's actually happening.
[02:51:51.796 --> 02:51:53.737]  Because that's how you judge in LA.
[02:51:53.737 --> 02:51:58.560]  A project's happening when you get a check and it clears the bank.
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:51:58.780]  Yes.
[02:52:00.575 --> 02:52:08.598]  Well, he should be getting paid next week for his opening participation in the show.
[02:52:08.598 --> 02:52:09.799]  We'll be ramping up.
[02:52:09.799 --> 02:52:21.684]  We haven't pared down to what the ten conspiracies will be, but I will tell you they are allowing me to go back after JFK.
[02:52:24.770 --> 02:52:47.208]  So we will be taking one trip back to the past, and we're going to unleash some probably new things on the John F. Kennedy assassination that I don't believe anybody else, and if we're successful on one of the things we do, it will completely show that it was a conspiracy and that Oswald did not act alone.
[02:52:47.208 --> 02:52:47.929]  Amazing.
[02:52:47.929 --> 02:52:49.330]  And that's all I'll say for now.
[02:52:50.211 --> 02:52:52.354]  Because I don't dare go any farther.
[02:52:52.354 --> 02:52:55.939]  Well, if you don't know the past, you're not going to know the future.
[02:52:55.939 --> 02:52:56.961]  Exactly.
[02:52:56.961 --> 02:53:02.268]  And you know, and then other things that are on the radar screen.
[02:53:02.268 --> 02:53:04.130]  Are you familiar with this Plum Island?
[02:53:04.824 --> 02:53:10.526]  Oh, Biological Weapons, Zoological Weapons Laboratory, off the coast of New York, where we got Lyme disease and so much more.
[02:53:10.526 --> 02:53:13.827]  Now they've built 36 of these in major cities?
[02:53:13.827 --> 02:53:17.769]  Yeah, well, that's on the screen right now.
[02:53:17.769 --> 02:53:21.610]  And there's a few other good ones, and again, we're just paring them down now.
[02:53:21.610 --> 02:53:24.672]  We'll probably see what happens is this.
[02:53:24.672 --> 02:53:28.133]  TruTV will start off and they'll approve, like, two or three of them.
[02:53:28.753 --> 02:53:31.394]  So we'll go ahead and begin working on them.
[02:53:31.394 --> 02:53:37.437]  Then in the process of working on them, other approvals will come for the other shows.
[02:53:37.437 --> 02:53:42.139]  So then the staff will start ramping up for those shows also.
[02:53:42.139 --> 02:53:48.722]  What gets confusing in doing the shows is that sometimes we'll be doing four of them at one time.
[02:53:49.591 --> 02:53:51.533]  Well, you guys aren't half-assing this either.
[02:53:51.533 --> 02:53:55.697]  You do a lot of research, a lot of work, a lot goes into this television show.
[02:53:55.697 --> 02:54:08.469]  Well, I'll tell you, for our little purse-string budget that we're on, we do a hell of a job, because you know what I actually did in negotiations this year?
[02:54:09.672 --> 02:54:17.020]  I was already locked in for the second season, so I couldn't negotiate money at all, but I could negotiate artistically.
[02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:28.614]  I told my top agent at William Morris, I said, look, I said, I want it in writing that this year we'll actually get a set of clappers for when we're out on the streets.
[02:54:29.935 --> 02:54:32.197]  You know what clappers are now, right?
[02:54:32.197 --> 02:54:33.458]  Uh, tell me.
[02:54:33.458 --> 02:54:36.460]  Well, they're those little boards you see in Hollywood with the clickers.
[02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:40.202]  Put it in front of the camera, what scene it is, blah blah blah, and then they clap.
[02:54:40.202 --> 02:54:40.322]  Yes.
[02:54:40.322 --> 02:54:42.644]  And that way you can separate all your shoots.
[02:54:43.849 --> 02:54:49.812]  Well, we were so cheap in doing this thing, initially, we had to use our hands.
[02:54:49.812 --> 02:54:50.632]  I remember.
[02:54:50.632 --> 02:54:51.373]  Yeah.
[02:54:51.373 --> 02:54:52.353]  To clap.
[02:54:52.353 --> 02:54:59.476]  And so I told them, I said, look, the only thing I demand is that I want it in writing that we will have a clapper center.
[02:54:59.476 --> 02:55:00.657]  Shoot.
[02:55:00.657 --> 02:55:10.081]  And it was funny because my top agent at William Morris started laughing and he said, Governor, I can assure you, I'll take it out of our end.
[02:55:10.081 --> 02:55:11.682]  You will have a clapper this year.
[02:55:13.681 --> 02:55:21.124]  Man, I tell ya, you spent so much time, what, six months of work or more, over a year, making the last television program.
[02:55:21.124 --> 02:55:22.965]  So when will we see this air?
[02:55:22.965 --> 02:55:25.386]  In the fall of this year?
[02:55:25.386 --> 02:55:36.910]  I can't even venture a guess right now, because again, it'll depend on how many of them they want done and in the can, and at what point are we out to finish up whatever's left.
[02:55:37.470 --> 02:55:38.451]  Well, I look forward to it.
[02:56:02.529 --> 02:56:04.331]  Well, I'll look forward to seeing you again in person.
[02:56:04.331 --> 02:56:06.853]  You're so great, and so is your son and the whole crew.
[02:56:06.853 --> 02:56:15.782]  The book is American Conspiracies, available at InfoWars.com and everywhere else, but we have it discounted with a free film at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:56:15.782 --> 02:56:18.324]  Governor Ventura, in closing, we got about three minutes left here.
[02:56:23.161 --> 02:56:28.643]  Studying the New World Order, studying the global elite, studying these shadowy organizations.
[02:56:28.643 --> 02:56:36.666]  What has it been like, your immersion in this, and what is your model now of who's running the world and what their agenda is?
[02:56:38.229 --> 02:56:40.372]  I still don't know exactly who is.
[02:56:40.372 --> 02:56:43.376]  You know, if you're asking me to name names, I can't do that.
[02:56:43.376 --> 02:56:45.139]  Even Fletcher Prouty can't do it.
[02:56:45.139 --> 02:56:46.340]  No, but what their agenda is?
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:50.887]  Look, to me, the agenda is simple and it seems clear to me.
[02:56:50.887 --> 02:56:54.552]  Ever since 9-11, it's been an agenda to take away our freedoms.
[02:56:55.993 --> 02:57:11.582]  And I think you can leave it right at that, because the most dangerous thing I've seen that have come out of all of this crap in the last ten years is the fact that they've suspended habeas corpus, they've literally shredded the Fourth Amendment of illegal search and seizure.
[02:57:11.582 --> 02:57:21.528]  Every person in America needs to understand that every phone call you make and every email you send, the government has the capability to be eavesdropping that.
[02:57:22.168 --> 02:57:22.468]  Why?
[02:57:22.468 --> 02:57:22.969]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:57:50.157 --> 02:57:50.737]  That's true!
[02:57:50.737 --> 02:57:52.518]  Yeah, you're damn right it's true!
[02:57:52.518 --> 02:57:54.258]  All the originals are hemp!
[02:57:54.258 --> 02:57:56.718]  They're all made out of marijuana!
[02:57:56.718 --> 02:58:02.000]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Betsy Ross's flag!
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:12.882]  And so it doesn't surprise me that they want to eradicate marijuana because they're eradicating our Constitution, they're eradicating our Bill of Rights, and they've certainly eradicated the flag, in my opinion.
[02:58:13.618 --> 02:58:18.881]  Governor, I'm going to say bye to you as soon as the show ends here in about 30 seconds, but I really want to thank you for coming on.
[02:58:18.881 --> 02:58:33.367]  Congratulations for doing it your way, telling the truth, not compromising, getting a number one hit TV show on your network, number four on the New York Times bestseller list for the book, and people are waking up and we got a good chance of bringing down this new world order, and thank God we got you on our team.
[02:58:33.367 --> 02:58:34.888]  God bless you, Governor.
[02:58:34.888 --> 02:58:36.089]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[02:58:36.089 --> 02:58:38.610]  We'll talk to you again in the spring.
[02:58:38.610 --> 02:58:39.390]  Absolutely.
[02:58:39.390 --> 02:58:40.471]  God bless you, Jesse Ventura.

[02:59:54.108 --> 02:59:56.491]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.491 --> 03:00:06.803]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[03:00:06.803 --> 03:00:08.104]  Big Brother.
[03:00:08.104 --> 03:00:09.866]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:09.866 --> 03:00:11.648]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:11.648 --> 03:00:12.389]  You want answers?
[03:00:13.206 --> 03:00:14.107]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.107 --> 03:00:18.952]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.952 --> 03:00:24.017]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.017 --> 03:00:37.790]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, the father of Reaganomics, the head of policy department of Treasury under Reagan, best-selling author, syndicated columnist about a week and a half ago, wrote this article, Goodbye, Truth Has Fallen and Taken Liberty With It.
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:40.921]  And he said he'll do a few more interviews.
[03:00:40.921 --> 03:00:44.402]  In fact, he wants to come on tax day to talk about the slavery on the 15th.
[03:00:44.402 --> 03:00:48.363]  But then he's disengaging and fading off into the sunset.
[03:00:48.363 --> 03:00:53.385]  And we're honored to have him here with us today to talk about a host of issues.
[03:00:53.385 --> 03:00:58.547]  In fact, he's got a list of things he wants to talk about and why he is saying sayonara.
[03:00:58.547 --> 03:00:59.947]  And then we're going to get into Volcker.
[03:00:59.947 --> 03:01:04.549]  Carbon tax, VAT, should be on the table on top of the income tax.
[03:01:05.349 --> 03:01:08.570]  We'll be discussing that with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:01:08.570 --> 03:01:09.711]  Doc, good to have you here with us.
[03:01:09.711 --> 03:01:11.571]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:01:11.571 --> 03:01:12.752]  Well, you've got the floor.
[03:01:12.752 --> 03:01:14.292]  I mean, why are you leaving?
[03:01:14.292 --> 03:01:15.553]  Why have you made this decision?
[03:01:15.553 --> 03:01:17.173]  We're gonna walk through it.
[03:01:17.173 --> 03:01:27.757]  It says, remind Alex that he wants to ask me about 9-11, Murrah office bombing, Waco, Operation Northwoods, JFK, and we'll talk about the economy and the dying superpower.
[03:01:27.757 --> 03:01:30.158]  So here you are, you got the floor.
[03:01:30.158 --> 03:01:30.598]  Well, Alex,
[03:01:32.443 --> 03:01:40.789]  You'd wanted me to explain why I was stopping to call him, and basically a bunch of things just came together.
[03:01:40.789 --> 03:01:41.910]  One is, I'm just tired.
[03:01:41.910 --> 03:01:46.953]  I've been trying to sell you the country all my life.
[03:01:46.953 --> 03:02:00.963]  The main thing is, though, I think I came to the conclusion that it's futile to write about what's happening, to write about the wars and the police state.
[03:02:02.270 --> 03:02:13.937]  The lack of our civil liberties, as long as the event that set those in motion itself can't be analyzed.
[03:02:13.937 --> 03:02:16.639]  And, of course, we're talking about 9-11.
[03:02:16.639 --> 03:02:28.486]  So, it dawned on me that sites on which I was sort of a favorite columnist, like AntiWar.com, Counterpunch,
[03:02:30.772 --> 03:02:58.453]  Where I have a big following that neither side, for example, would let me even present facts or even present the evidence that the scientists who claimed to have found nanothermite in the residue of the World Trade Center tower, they wouldn't even let me
[03:03:00.655 --> 03:03:12.262]  Uh, report that there were a thousand architects and engineers who had sent a petition to Congress demanding an investigation.
[03:03:12.262 --> 03:03:22.567]  And so it made me realize that, uh, here were sites totally opposed to the war, totally opposed to the police state and the loss of our civil liberties.
[03:03:22.567 --> 03:03:28.871]  Sites who don't believe a word the government says about anything except 9-11.
[03:03:30.808 --> 03:03:34.371]  I got to thinking, well, what is the point of this?
[03:03:34.371 --> 03:03:43.938]  How can you oppose the government when you give it the grounds on which it's acting?
[03:03:43.938 --> 03:03:56.467]  So, I came to the conclusion that since 9-11, since it cannot be discussed, except, you know, in a few places like your site, and since people
[03:03:58.464 --> 03:04:10.008]  believe that they were attacked by Muslims and that we have to have police state powers to protect us from more attacks, that really nothing can be done.
[03:04:10.008 --> 03:04:14.050]  And so I said it's futile and pointless.
[03:04:14.050 --> 03:04:25.514]  And then about that time I saw the latest poll that said 59% of the American people, that's three-fifths of the population,
[03:04:26.542 --> 03:04:30.364]  Uh, are ready to go to war with Iran.
[03:04:30.364 --> 03:04:37.108]  Uh, if they don't stop their, uh, peaceful, uh, nuclear energy program.
[03:04:37.108 --> 03:04:41.450]  And I got to thinking, well, how can people come to this conclusion?
[03:04:41.450 --> 03:04:47.934]  They've been lied to about, uh, weapons of mass destruction, LK, everything.
[03:04:47.934 --> 03:04:48.794]  Well, Doc, stay there.
[03:04:48.794 --> 03:04:49.414]  We got a break.
[03:04:49.414 --> 03:04:50.275]  We're going to come back and
[03:04:53.426 --> 03:05:04.733]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.733 --> 03:05:10.056]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.056 --> 03:05:12.117]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.117 --> 03:05:17.120]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.120 --> 03:05:18.300]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.300 --> 03:05:19.041]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.401 --> 03:05:21.303]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.303 --> 03:05:22.365]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.365 --> 03:05:24.567]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.567 --> 03:05:25.909]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.909 --> 03:05:27.451]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.451 --> 03:05:32.717]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.717 --> 03:05:35.841]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.281 --> 03:05:40.105]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.105 --> 03:05:41.326]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.326 --> 03:05:42.247]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.247 --> 03:05:43.348]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.348 --> 03:05:44.269]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:45.370]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.370 --> 03:05:48.413]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.413 --> 03:05:51.276]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:51.276 --> 03:05:52.037]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:01.092 --> 03:06:02.252]  What's your home worth?
[03:06:02.252 --> 03:06:04.353]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[03:06:04.353 --> 03:06:07.394]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[03:06:07.394 --> 03:06:15.116]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[03:07:00.535 --> 03:07:02.837]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:07:02.837 --> 03:07:05.238]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:07:05.238 --> 03:07:08.440]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:13.564]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:07:13.564 --> 03:07:18.067]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:07:18.067 --> 03:07:20.528]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:07:20.528 --> 03:07:22.970]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:07:22.970 --> 03:07:25.812]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:07:26.212 --> 03:07:34.161]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:07:34.161 --> 03:07:39.528]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:07:39.528 --> 03:07:41.870]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:45.795]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:07:46.075 --> 03:07:47.155]  And I got news for you.
[03:07:47.155 --> 03:07:48.476]  You're everyone else.
[03:07:48.476 --> 03:07:49.976]  Invisible Empire.

[03:08:03.661 --> 03:08:06.321]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:06.321 --> 03:08:09.122]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.169 --> 03:08:14.892]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is with us.
[03:08:14.892 --> 03:08:16.995]  He just joined us for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:16.995 --> 03:08:20.039]  He's gonna do this interview and then one on tax day with us.
[03:08:20.039 --> 03:08:22.702]  And then, uh, bow out, uh, perhaps forever.
[03:08:22.702 --> 03:08:25.246]  He's not writing his column anymore.
[03:08:25.246 --> 03:08:27.169]  He's been writing two a week for a very long time.
[03:08:27.882 --> 03:08:30.303]  Yeah, you know, it's an unbelievable story.
[03:08:30.303 --> 03:08:33.684]  In fact, you know, if you just look, anybody that looks at the World Trade Center towers for 15 seconds,
[03:08:55.566 --> 03:08:58.308]  You realize these are not buildings falling down.
[03:08:58.308 --> 03:09:00.690]  There's no sign of a building falling down.
[03:09:00.690 --> 03:09:02.431]  They're blowing up.
[03:09:02.431 --> 03:09:09.296]  And anybody that looks at it for 15 seconds should be able to see the difference between a building that's falling down and one that's blowing up.
[03:09:09.296 --> 03:09:12.638]  And so Americans can't even use their own eyes.
[03:09:12.638 --> 03:09:14.279]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[03:09:14.279 --> 03:09:17.561]  And then we have this fantasy figure, Sheikh Mohammed.
[03:09:17.561 --> 03:09:22.925]  Now, you know, they said that bin Laden was responsible, but
[03:09:24.733 --> 03:09:33.381]  Now, it's this Sheikh Mohammed, the guy they waterboarded 183 times until he finally confessed to being the mastermind.
[03:09:33.381 --> 03:09:40.347]  Now, if you look at this, it makes no sense, because look at this guy's feet.
[03:09:40.347 --> 03:09:43.870]  Sheikh Mohammed outwitted all 16 U.S.
[03:09:43.870 --> 03:09:47.013]  intelligence agencies, along with those of all U.S.
[03:09:47.013 --> 03:09:49.035]  allies, including Israel's Mossad.
[03:09:50.020 --> 03:09:56.923]  So no intelligence service on Earth, nor all of them combined, was a match for Sheikh Mohammed.
[03:09:56.923 --> 03:10:02.866]  He outwitted the National Security Council, Dick Cheney, the Pentagon, State Department, NORAD, U.S.
[03:10:02.866 --> 03:10:04.707]  Air Force, Air Traffic Control.
[03:10:04.707 --> 03:10:09.089]  He caused airport security to fail four times in one morning.
[03:10:09.089 --> 03:10:14.991]  He caused the state-of-the-art air defenses of the Pentagon to fail.
[03:10:14.991 --> 03:10:19.013]  He had people who couldn't fly planes pulling off fantastic
[03:10:21.103 --> 03:10:24.104]  He was able to do all of these things.
[03:10:24.104 --> 03:10:31.588]  Now, he's more of a superhero than V in that movie, V for Vendetta.
[03:10:31.588 --> 03:10:34.530]  Nobody can do things like that.
[03:10:34.530 --> 03:10:37.451]  Nobody can pull off an operation like that.
[03:10:37.451 --> 03:10:42.954]  That's just fantasy beyond fantasy, and yet people have fallen for this.
[03:10:42.954 --> 03:10:48.677]  So you realize that you really just can't help people that can't think, that can't
[03:10:49.503 --> 03:10:50.704]  See their own eyes.
[03:10:50.704 --> 03:10:56.926]  Now, what also happens when you try to raise these questions with people, even intelligent people?
[03:10:56.926 --> 03:11:01.008]  They say, oh, our government would never kill its own citizens.
[03:11:01.008 --> 03:11:01.929]  Oh, yeah?
[03:11:01.929 --> 03:11:04.130]  What about Waco?
[03:11:04.130 --> 03:11:05.150]  The Branch Davidians.
[03:11:05.150 --> 03:11:09.712]  There were 100 men, women, and children that the government murdered.
[03:11:09.712 --> 03:11:13.054]  No one was ever held accountable.
[03:11:13.054 --> 03:11:17.636]  But they say, oh, well, it was all the Branch Davidians' fault.
[03:11:18.517 --> 03:11:21.799]  But the government would never have a plot like 9-11.
[03:11:21.799 --> 03:11:25.020]  Well, what about Operation Northwood?
[03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:26.341]  Anybody can read about this.
[03:11:26.341 --> 03:11:34.725]  This was a plan designed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Lyman Lemitzer.
[03:11:34.725 --> 03:11:40.008]  It was released by the Warren Commission after the Kennedy report.
[03:11:40.931 --> 03:11:43.013]  It's available online.
[03:11:43.013 --> 03:11:46.435]  It's available in the National Security Archives.
[03:11:46.435 --> 03:11:48.076]  You can read about it on Wikipedia.
[03:11:48.076 --> 03:11:49.277]  It's everywhere.
[03:11:49.277 --> 03:12:07.651]  Here was an official plot by the United States military and various black op groups in the government to gun down American citizens in Miami, in Washington, D.C., to blow up
[03:12:08.948 --> 03:12:20.571]  Boats of Cuban refugees to fabricate crashed airliners and to blame it all on Castro so they could invade Cuba.
[03:12:20.571 --> 03:12:25.612]  This is a known thing that we were prepared to do.
[03:12:25.612 --> 03:12:36.074]  And this was, you know, like 60, this was what, 40, 50 years ago when we allegedly were still somewhat of a
[03:12:37.310 --> 03:12:39.651]  of a freedom and democracy country.
[03:12:39.651 --> 03:12:41.051]  And they were willing to do that then.
[03:12:41.051 --> 03:12:44.832]  And Kennedy, of course, fired LaMette, sir.
[03:12:44.832 --> 03:12:49.313]  And a lot of people believe that's why Kennedy was assassinated.
[03:12:49.313 --> 03:13:01.456]  And then we have this very curious Murrah office building bombing, the Oklahoma City bombing, that was penned on McVeigh with this truck full of lots of bombs.
[03:13:01.456 --> 03:13:04.357]  Well, General Parton
[03:13:05.086 --> 03:13:08.449]  It was head of Air Force Munitions.
[03:13:08.449 --> 03:13:15.854]  Spent his life developing, testing explosives for the Air Force.
[03:13:15.854 --> 03:13:25.222]  He put out a very thick report in which he said that that building was blown up from the inside out.
[03:13:25.222 --> 03:13:28.404]  And it most certainly was not blown up by a truck bomb.
[03:13:28.404 --> 03:13:32.988]  The truck bomb of that sort, 60 feet away, couldn't possibly
[03:13:33.897 --> 03:13:44.999]  have done the damage and produced the outward explosions and the structural damage to those reinforced concrete columns.
[03:13:44.999 --> 03:13:51.441]  So, he was a real expert who put it on the line.
[03:13:51.441 --> 03:13:55.402]  It had no impact whatsoever.
[03:13:55.402 --> 03:13:57.602]  He sent it to the Congress.
[03:13:57.602 --> 03:13:59.423]  He tried to talk to them.
[03:13:59.423 --> 03:14:01.143]  It was just all deep-sixed.
[03:14:03.789 --> 03:14:14.312]  So, what you have is a situation where it's impossible for experts, even, to bring facts.
[03:14:14.312 --> 03:14:24.175]  Not just to the public's attention, but to the attention of people in government who are supposed to be overseeing the government, such as the various congressional committees.
[03:14:24.175 --> 03:14:28.276]  So when you have that type of a situation, you know what?
[03:14:28.276 --> 03:14:30.796]  What has become of truth?
[03:14:30.796 --> 03:14:32.537]  It simply disappeared.
[03:14:34.574 --> 03:14:43.759]  It can't even get into the arena where various material interests operate.
[03:14:43.759 --> 03:14:50.382]  And so, you have to ask yourself, what am I writing these columns for?
[03:14:50.382 --> 03:14:52.703]  The people fall for anything.
[03:14:52.703 --> 03:15:02.328]  The most absurd explanations and fantasies they accept as if they were actually real, and yet they're completely deaf.
[03:15:03.547 --> 03:15:06.970]  The experts, the facts.
[03:15:06.970 --> 03:15:08.592]  And so you can't help them.
[03:15:08.592 --> 03:15:13.176]  And so that's really the main reason I quit doing the column.
[03:15:13.176 --> 03:15:18.200]  I just came to the conclusion it was futile.
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:20.842]  The people are just so gullible.
[03:15:20.842 --> 03:15:23.204]  Well, doctor, let me throw something in here.
[03:15:23.204 --> 03:15:24.806]  I mean, we don't need to lose all hope.
[03:15:25.584 --> 03:15:25.904]  I think?
[03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:46.912]  Patch us up like we were here.
[03:15:46.912 --> 03:15:50.354]  Minutes after it happened, lying, saying they were on the 9th floor.
[03:15:50.354 --> 03:15:54.917]  Terrence Yakey, a local police officer that was a hero, carried people out, said it was all staged.
[03:15:54.917 --> 03:15:56.158]  They murdered and tortured him.
[03:15:56.158 --> 03:15:57.559]  Going back to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[03:15:58.340 --> 03:15:59.721]  Backing you up there.
[03:15:59.721 --> 03:16:14.308]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till four years after he was incarcerated, and even the 100-plus water boardings wouldn't make him lie and say he ran 9-11, so then they threatened to do stuff to his family, and that's mainstream news.
[03:16:14.308 --> 03:16:17.810]  So finally, for his children, he confessed to it.
[03:16:17.810 --> 03:16:23.013]  But it's a process, and it was 5% won the Revolutionary War or less,
[03:16:23.957 --> 03:16:37.567]  And just because they do have a large portion of the public, like Congressman Johnson from Georgia who believes that islands float, and that they're going to capsize if there's too many people on them, that's, I mean, you know, a lot of dumbed-down people out there, even in government.
[03:16:37.567 --> 03:16:47.835]  It doesn't matter because your work and others' work is really woken a lot of people up, and I see a giant awakening happening, and I don't blame you for quitting a twice-a-week, uh, twice-a-week
[03:16:48.567 --> 03:16:49.307]  Well, you know, Alex,
[03:17:19.821 --> 03:17:21.182]  You say it's public knowledge.
[03:17:21.182 --> 03:17:24.144]  I mean, it's available to the public.
[03:17:24.144 --> 03:17:25.665]  They could know it, but they don't.
[03:17:25.665 --> 03:17:28.807]  I mean, you know it, and I know it, and a few others know it.
[03:17:28.807 --> 03:17:34.491]  And the people that they call kooks, the 9-11 skeptics.
[03:17:34.491 --> 03:17:39.214]  But it's public knowledge only in the sense that it's available.
[03:17:40.020 --> 03:17:42.182]  But the public doesn't know it and doesn't want to know it.
[03:17:42.182 --> 03:17:44.063]  And if you try to tell them, they get mad.
[03:17:44.063 --> 03:17:46.005]  Well, doctor, let me stop you again.
[03:17:46.005 --> 03:17:49.688]  You use a poll of 57% wanting to attack Iran.
[03:17:49.688 --> 03:17:52.891]  They have select demographics they can call.
[03:17:52.891 --> 03:17:54.953]  I've commissioned polls before.
[03:17:54.953 --> 03:17:55.993]  And I know you know about polls.
[03:17:55.993 --> 03:18:01.398]  I've been in government and media a lot longer than I have been in the media.
[03:18:01.398 --> 03:18:06.042]  I mean, we've got an Angus and Reed New York Times poll from 2006 with 84% believing we've been lied to about 9-11.
[03:18:08.954 --> 03:18:13.555]  And so, I don't trust some of these polls we're seeing.
[03:18:13.555 --> 03:18:14.335]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:18:14.335 --> 03:18:16.776]  Polls could actually never even occur.
[03:18:16.776 --> 03:18:25.497]  I mean, I could see that the CIA or some government agency, the Pentagon, goes to polls and say, here's a bunch of money.
[03:18:25.497 --> 03:18:26.437]  Give us this result.
[03:18:26.437 --> 03:18:28.158]  Here's the result we want.
[03:18:28.158 --> 03:18:29.398]  And that's entirely possible.
[03:18:29.398 --> 03:18:34.519]  I mean, as I said in my sign-off, article money has replaced everything.
[03:18:35.581 --> 03:18:39.743]  And people will do anything for money, lie, cheat, steal.
[03:18:39.743 --> 03:18:41.524]  And they do all the time.
[03:18:41.524 --> 03:18:44.465]  And so, you're completely right.
[03:18:44.465 --> 03:18:49.328]  But let's assume that the people do know.
[03:18:49.328 --> 03:18:51.009]  They still do nothing about it.
[03:18:51.009 --> 03:18:53.850]  They've got no way of doing anything about it.
[03:18:53.850 --> 03:18:56.911]  The government doesn't represent them.
[03:18:56.911 --> 03:19:00.033]  Doesn't listen to them.
[03:19:00.033 --> 03:19:02.594]  In every sense, they become irrelevant.
[03:19:02.594 --> 03:19:03.955]  The government represents
[03:19:04.753 --> 03:19:11.539]  The powerful moneyed interest groups that finance the political campaigns.
[03:19:11.539 --> 03:19:28.756]  And so, the people are really, even if we had them all educated and aware, which I don't think we do, still, there's nothing short of arming themselves and rebellion.
[03:19:29.727 --> 03:19:30.107]  Stay there.
[03:19:30.107 --> 03:19:32.148]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us today.
[03:19:32.148 --> 03:19:37.009]  We're going to continue going over his Swan Song final article that he wrote a week and a half ago.
[03:19:55.533 --> 03:20:00.680]  And I've got a lot of other points I want to bring up with him as a top economist on all these new taxes they're announcing.
[03:20:00.680 --> 03:20:01.161]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.161 --> 03:20:04.706]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[03:20:04.706 --> 03:20:06.989]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[03:20:06.989 --> 03:20:07.850]  Don't!
[03:20:07.850 --> 03:20:10.875]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[03:20:11.275 --> 03:20:20.381]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[03:20:20.381 --> 03:20:24.464]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[03:20:24.464 --> 03:20:27.146]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[03:20:27.586 --> 03:20:34.950]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:36.131]  Herb K was right.
[03:20:36.131 --> 03:20:39.353]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[03:20:39.353 --> 03:20:40.774]  What have you got to lose?
[03:20:40.774 --> 03:20:42.054]  Stop the calls now.
[03:20:42.054 --> 03:20:44.075]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[03:20:44.075 --> 03:20:47.597]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[03:20:47.597 --> 03:20:47.978]  Call 800-822-1291.
[03:20:47.978 --> 03:20:48.398]  That's 800-822-1291.
[03:20:56.152 --> 03:20:56.472]  800-822-1291.
[03:20:56.472 --> 03:21:05.118]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:21:05.118 --> 03:21:06.378]  Tyranny is here.
[03:21:06.378 --> 03:21:10.121]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:21:10.121 --> 03:21:12.542]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:21:12.542 --> 03:21:18.406]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:21:18.406 --> 03:21:24.610]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:31.015]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:21:31.015 --> 03:21:35.219]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:21:35.219 --> 03:21:39.522]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:21:39.522 --> 03:21:45.467]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:21:45.467 --> 03:21:49.030]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:21:49.030 --> 03:21:50.991]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:21:50.991 --> 03:21:51.432]  It's here.

[03:22:12.266 --> 03:22:14.328]  forces, so we know it's tough.
[03:22:14.328 --> 03:22:15.328]  What kind of gear?
[03:22:15.328 --> 03:22:16.289]  Our own brands.
[03:22:16.289 --> 03:22:19.171]  Arctic Warrior, Homeland Defender, Sandbox Avenger,
[03:22:20.981 --> 03:22:21.401]  We're good to go.
[03:22:50.669 --> 03:23:04.554]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[03:23:04.554 --> 03:23:12.736]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[03:23:12.736 --> 03:23:16.257]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable
[03:23:16.357 --> 03:23:17.097]  We're good to go.
[03:23:38.592 --> 03:23:40.313]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[03:24:08.010 --> 03:24:11.091]  That's right, the awakening has begun, the enemy is afraid.
[03:24:11.091 --> 03:24:15.192]  We're gonna win this thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:15.192 --> 03:24:17.953]  Thanks to the work of people like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:24:17.953 --> 03:24:28.095]  The fundamental situation we face is a decadent, entertainment-drunk culture who don't see themselves in the role of being informed or involved.
[03:24:28.095 --> 03:24:32.796]  Our numbers are much greater than many know, because I'm here every day, I see the numbers.
[03:24:32.796 --> 03:24:34.937]  And I see the trend going up, but...
[03:24:36.701 --> 03:24:40.243]  The scientific dictatorship has set up Homeland Security and NORTHCOM.
[03:24:40.243 --> 03:24:46.827]  They want to push the American people into violent resistance so they can bring in a full tyranny.
[03:24:46.827 --> 03:24:47.988]  We must resist.
[03:24:47.988 --> 03:24:48.928]  We must speak out.
[03:24:48.928 --> 03:24:51.329]  We must deprogram people.
[03:24:51.329 --> 03:24:54.551]  And that's what we attempt to do here each and every day.
[03:24:54.551 --> 03:24:56.793]  But they say there's a sign as you enter hell.
[03:24:56.793 --> 03:24:59.814]  All those that enter here give up hope.
[03:24:59.814 --> 03:25:02.356]  Well, we haven't reached hell yet.
[03:25:02.356 --> 03:25:05.518]  But, you know, we have Dr. Roberts being censored in his
[03:25:06.519 --> 03:25:06.659]  Yeah.
[03:25:06.659 --> 03:25:06.959]  We are.
[03:25:06.959 --> 03:25:07.599]  We are in dire straits.
[03:25:33.797 --> 03:25:35.838]  I still think the people are not aware of it.
[03:25:35.838 --> 03:25:38.199]  They're insouciant.
[03:25:38.199 --> 03:25:52.144]  And, look, think about the, uh, we covered, uh, you know, the, uh, you know, the McVeigh, Oklahoma City bombing, 9-11, Operation Northwards, but just think about the Kennedy assassination.
[03:25:52.144 --> 03:25:57.266]  I think when the black ops groups got away with that, that's what kind of sealed our fate.
[03:25:57.266 --> 03:26:00.427]  And the liberals let them get away with it.
[03:26:00.427 --> 03:26:01.868]  Because, with
[03:26:02.682 --> 03:26:10.970]  With the election of Kennedy, you see, the liberals had overcome the Eisenhower Republicans.
[03:26:10.970 --> 03:26:14.913]  And we're now going to use the government to do great things.
[03:26:14.913 --> 03:26:22.220]  We're going to use the government to do great things for the American people and remake society and make it more fair and just and all of this.
[03:26:22.220 --> 03:26:28.406]  So they couldn't possibly let it out that the government had killed the President.
[03:26:30.413 --> 03:26:49.977]  So they concocted another fantasy story about how Oswald, with a worthless rifle, shot Kennedy from behind and killed him with a magic bullet that also wounded Connolly and did all kinds of improbable things.
[03:26:49.977 --> 03:26:57.879]  And yet, all the evidence is that Kennedy was hit from the right front, at the right front temple, throughout the back of his head.
[03:26:57.879 --> 03:26:58.679]  You can see that.
[03:26:59.537 --> 03:27:02.198]  In the films that tourists took.
[03:27:02.198 --> 03:27:11.840]  And you can see Jackie, his wife, crawling out on the trunk of the limo to recover the back part of his skull that you've just seen blown out from the front.
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:13.721]  You know, the bullet hitting the front, blowing it out.
[03:27:13.721 --> 03:27:16.762]  All these things are available.
[03:27:16.762 --> 03:27:27.745]  And then they get this patch of Oswald, and before he can ever be questioned, Jack Ruby is somehow with a gun inside a jail where he doesn't belong.
[03:27:27.745 --> 03:27:28.765]  He has no right to be
[03:27:29.858 --> 03:27:35.700]  Inside the jail, much less with a gun, and he shoots Oswald inside the jail!
[03:27:35.700 --> 03:27:48.325]  And, yet people still fall for the Warren Commission report, which has been disproved over and over and over and over by expert after expert after expert.
[03:27:48.325 --> 03:27:59.009]  And yet, we still have this sort of, uh, pathology of, of Oswald killed Kennedy, and then even after
[03:28:00.289 --> 03:28:05.253]  All the evidence finally forced the Congressional Committee to look at it again.
[03:28:05.253 --> 03:28:13.960]  And you had all these witnesses who saw a gunman at the Grassy Knoll shoot.
[03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:16.362]  And so what do they do finally?
[03:28:16.362 --> 03:28:23.908]  Well, Congress issues the report, well, there was a second gunman.
[03:28:23.908 --> 03:28:25.109]  Another loner.
[03:28:25.109 --> 03:28:28.551]  Another deranged loner.
[03:28:28.551 --> 03:28:29.172]  So we have
[03:28:29.704 --> 03:28:38.226]  Two deranged loners, operating independently of one another, both decided to shoot Kennedy on the same day, same place.
[03:28:38.226 --> 03:28:42.007]  Now, how can anybody believe these things?
[03:28:42.007 --> 03:28:43.188]  And yet they do.
[03:28:43.188 --> 03:28:52.010]  And you're talking about the 79 report where they said a 98% chance that it was a conspiracy?
[03:28:52.010 --> 03:28:56.071]  Well, you know, they kind of... the conspiracy...
[03:28:57.386 --> 03:29:10.271]  Well, maybe I don't remember it exactly right, but I thought the conspiracy kind of disappeared by the final conclusion that it was a second balloon.
[03:29:10.271 --> 03:29:11.792]  Yeah, they inserted that in there.
[03:29:11.792 --> 03:29:14.433]  Yeah, somebody did.
[03:29:14.433 --> 03:29:21.936]  So, basically the government seems to be able to do whatever it wants.
[03:29:21.936 --> 03:29:23.357]  I can't say the government.
[03:29:24.914 --> 03:29:29.558]  There's some parts of the government.
[03:29:29.558 --> 03:29:34.381]  The secret team that Fletcher Prouty talked about, the former head of Black Ops at the Pentagon, stay there.
[03:29:34.381 --> 03:29:35.402]  Long segment coming up.
[03:29:35.402 --> 03:29:36.903]  We're going to finish up with Kennedy.
[03:29:36.903 --> 03:29:41.847]  Let's get into some other subjects and talk about the economy.
[03:29:41.847 --> 03:29:50.674]  Fresh off their takeover of health care and all the other tax increases, they say they're going to ram through the carbon taxes and a value added and a sales tax.
[03:29:50.674 --> 03:29:51.174]  It's incredible.
[03:29:51.693 --> 03:29:54.675]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.675 --> 03:30:01.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.160 --> 03:30:02.461]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:02.461 --> 03:30:08.045]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:30:08.045 --> 03:30:13.089]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:30:13.089 --> 03:30:18.113]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:30:18.633 --> 03:30:23.858]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:30:23.858 --> 03:30:26.180]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:30:26.180 --> 03:30:30.985]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:30:30.985 --> 03:30:32.106]  And here's the best part.
[03:30:32.106 --> 03:30:35.169]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:30:35.169 --> 03:30:38.472]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[03:30:50.195 --> 03:30:57.817]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:30:57.817 --> 03:31:00.198]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:01.340 --> 03:31:03.722]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:03.722 --> 03:31:06.043]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:06.043 --> 03:31:09.266]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:09.266 --> 03:31:14.369]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:14.369 --> 03:31:18.572]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:18.872 --> 03:31:21.333]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:21.333 --> 03:31:24.115]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:24.115 --> 03:31:27.017]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:27.017 --> 03:31:34.621]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:34.961 --> 03:31:40.345]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:40.345 --> 03:31:43.208]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:43.208 --> 03:31:46.890]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:46.890 --> 03:31:47.971]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:47.971 --> 03:31:49.312]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:49.312 --> 03:31:50.813]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:00.672 --> 03:32:01.974]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:32:01.974 --> 03:32:07.561]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:32:07.561 --> 03:32:12.587]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:32:12.587 --> 03:32:17.614]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:32:18.143 --> 03:32:23.366]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:32:23.366 --> 03:32:25.687]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:32:25.687 --> 03:32:30.489]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:32:30.489 --> 03:32:31.610]  And here's the best part.
[03:32:31.610 --> 03:32:34.671]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:32:34.671 --> 03:32:38.293]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:32:38.293 --> 03:32:41.495]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:32:41.495 --> 03:32:43.716]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:32:43.716 --> 03:32:44.636]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:32:48.278 --> 03:32:51.239]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:32:51.239 --> 03:32:57.340]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:32:57.340 --> 03:33:07.142]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:33:07.142 --> 03:33:15.664]  In our trailer for Invisible Empire, trailer 2, up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we have a clip of Obama a few months ago at the UN.
[03:33:16.701 --> 03:33:21.024]  And he said, no new world order can have one nation above another.
[03:33:21.024 --> 03:33:23.725]  And people thought, oh, that means have equality.
[03:33:23.725 --> 03:33:26.647]  No, that means lower all of us to third world standing.
[03:33:26.647 --> 03:33:37.074]  And that's what Bill Gates, Ted Turner, the UN, this is the ultra-rich mafia, basically, coming in and taking over society through environmental taxes, through all of it.
[03:33:37.074 --> 03:33:39.115]  And we have the father of Reaganomics.
[03:33:39.115 --> 03:33:44.078]  We have a gentleman listed by Forbes, many other publications, as one of the top ten living economists.
[03:33:44.938 --> 03:33:50.942]  Uh, and I was talking to him about Kennedy cutting taxes between 50 and 30 percent, depending on which tax it was.
[03:33:50.942 --> 03:33:52.743]  And he said, basically, that's correct.
[03:33:52.743 --> 03:33:54.584]  And more money came in.
[03:33:54.584 --> 03:33:55.465]  The government knows this.
[03:33:55.465 --> 03:33:58.447]  You cut taxes, the economy starts racing.
[03:33:58.447 --> 03:34:01.449]  But it's the free market, Main Street economy.
[03:34:01.449 --> 03:34:03.710]  And the big central banks don't want that.
[03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:06.012]  They want a controlled, vertically integrated economy.
[03:34:07.083 --> 03:34:07.344]  I think?
[03:34:25.974 --> 03:34:28.395]  At PrisonPlanet.tv, you can pre-order the DVD now.
[03:34:28.395 --> 03:34:30.436]  We're going to be shipping them out starting next week.
[03:34:30.436 --> 03:34:31.537]  You'll get them first.
[03:34:31.537 --> 03:34:42.542]  Those that pre-order, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, in their own words, open admission of global government, open admission of eugenics, government money laundering, drug dealing.
[03:34:42.542 --> 03:34:44.984]  It's all covered in Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[03:34:44.984 --> 03:34:53.768]  And then, a week later, we released Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, proving the FEMA camps, proving false flag terror, proving the underwear bombing was a staged event.
[03:34:54.455 --> 03:34:57.276]  Uh, covering executive orders, everything.
[03:34:57.276 --> 03:34:58.016]  Two new films.
[03:34:58.016 --> 03:35:00.977]  You can order them now in the month of April.
[03:35:00.977 --> 03:35:08.418]  Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:35:08.418 --> 03:35:08.998]  888-253-3139.
[03:35:08.998 --> 03:35:14.020]  Or you can watch them both online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:35:14.020 --> 03:35:15.620]  All right, going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:35:15.620 --> 03:35:17.621]  We've been having very interesting discussions behind the scenes.
[03:35:17.621 --> 03:35:19.481]  I want to get into the economy, but first going back
[03:35:20.337 --> 03:35:21.778]  to violent revolution.
[03:35:21.778 --> 03:35:35.327]  They've now framed it that even if you defend yourself when CPS without due process is snatching your kid, DynCorp runs many of the systems in the states, convicted white slavery traffickers, that's Chicago Tribune AP.
[03:35:35.327 --> 03:35:38.209]  If you resist them taking your farm, you're a terrorist.
[03:35:38.209 --> 03:35:40.651]  They clearly have set up this system.
[03:35:40.651 --> 03:35:45.514]  Now we have the Homeland Security internal documents where they admit Homeland Security is set up for the American people.
[03:35:46.674 --> 03:35:48.255]  So, where do you see this going?
[03:35:48.255 --> 03:35:51.037]  Because they're not going to implement any real reforms.
[03:35:51.037 --> 03:35:52.698]  This is by design, in my opinion.
[03:35:52.698 --> 03:35:55.379]  I mean, where is it going?
[03:35:55.379 --> 03:35:57.280]  Well, it's the police state.
[03:35:57.280 --> 03:36:04.064]  That's been obvious since the, you know, like the second year of the Bush administration, where we used to talk about it.
[03:36:04.064 --> 03:36:09.427]  If you'll remember, you're now, when you do interviews.
[03:36:09.427 --> 03:36:10.148]  Where is it going?
[03:36:14.466 --> 03:36:18.967]  The local police now are militarized.
[03:36:18.967 --> 03:36:22.508]  If you go to a gun club, all the police will be there.
[03:36:22.508 --> 03:36:23.708]  They've got automatic weapons.
[03:36:23.708 --> 03:36:26.508]  There'll be 20, 30, 40, 50 of them.
[03:36:26.508 --> 03:36:29.789]  And they're practicing mass fire.
[03:36:29.789 --> 03:36:32.269]  And what's it all about?
[03:36:32.269 --> 03:36:37.410]  It's for controlling the people who pay their salaries.
[03:36:37.410 --> 03:36:40.931]  So the whole thing is set up
[03:36:42.630 --> 03:36:47.735]  To prevent any kind of opposition from the population.
[03:36:47.735 --> 03:36:54.280]  And it's like you say, they can now declare anybody to be a terrorist.
[03:36:54.280 --> 03:37:01.946]  And therefore, they can confiscate not just your life and rights, but all your assets.
[03:37:01.946 --> 03:37:04.088]  So, it's a police state.
[03:37:04.088 --> 03:37:07.430]  People are not aware of this.
[03:37:07.430 --> 03:37:11.434]  They still think the government is there to protect them in some way.
[03:37:13.133 --> 03:37:20.458]  I get a lot of emails from people who are already suffering these types of intrusions.
[03:37:20.458 --> 03:37:26.362]  They've read my book about how the law has been destroyed, and they wonder what they can do.
[03:37:26.362 --> 03:37:33.546]  Of course, they haven't got any rights, so they can't do anything.
[03:37:33.546 --> 03:37:38.870]  I don't know how much of it is a plan with a direct
[03:37:39.836 --> 03:37:40.737]  I don't know.
[03:38:14.038 --> 03:38:30.369]  And now under NORTHCOM, we have the military everywhere conditioning the public at DWI checkpoints, at the Kentucky Derby, at football games, searching children, running checkpoints on the highways, an armed camp drilling and training to go after us.
[03:38:30.369 --> 03:38:33.791]  I want to cover one other issue before we get into the economy, Dr. Roberts.
[03:38:34.514 --> 03:38:40.200]  Have you seen the gun camera footage from three years ago in Iraq that WikiLeaks released a few days ago?
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:52.934]  They said they've got scores of these videos they're going to be releasing where they are killing the people and shooting the kids in the minivan trying to get a wounded reporter off the street and then secondarily
[03:38:53.554 --> 03:38:57.836]  I get these emails, it's a minority of the emails, saying, how dare you criticize our troops?
[03:38:57.836 --> 03:38:59.016]  This is a war.
[03:38:59.016 --> 03:39:02.517]  Well, yeah, this is a war that was built on lies and WMDs.
[03:39:02.517 --> 03:39:17.582]  We go invade the country, we kill over a million of them, and then there's this droning, brainwashed message that we've got to support the troops by keeping them in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 tours and treating them like garbage when they get back.
[03:39:17.582 --> 03:39:20.163]  It's just this mindless supposed patriotism
[03:39:20.794 --> 03:39:22.395]  To worship tyranny.
[03:39:22.395 --> 03:39:24.896]  It's very reminiscent of what happened to Nazi Germany.
[03:39:24.896 --> 03:39:26.117]  Yes, that's right.
[03:39:26.117 --> 03:39:26.977]  They're brown shorts.
[03:39:26.977 --> 03:39:30.339]  I've been calling them brown shorts for years.
[03:39:30.339 --> 03:39:33.621]  You've described it accurately.
[03:39:33.621 --> 03:39:37.643]  That's exactly the situation.
[03:39:37.643 --> 03:39:45.868]  There's another reason that I thought writing for these people is pointless.
[03:39:45.868 --> 03:39:49.430]  They can't fathom the danger that they're in.
[03:39:50.137 --> 03:39:54.399]  And many of them, of course, are still fighting the Vietnam War.
[03:39:54.399 --> 03:40:00.523]  They're still angry that we didn't win the war, but suppose we had won it, what would be any different?
[03:40:00.523 --> 03:40:07.126]  The whole thing is some form of emotional infantilism.
[03:40:07.126 --> 03:40:15.511]  They're people who are still three years old, and they're ruled by some sort of blind emotions.
[03:40:15.511 --> 03:40:18.172]  It's incapable of thought.
[03:40:18.172 --> 03:40:19.413]  They can't even take in facts.
[03:40:20.822 --> 03:40:25.016]  So talking to them is a waste of time.
[03:40:26.977 --> 03:40:27.978]  Arrested development.
[03:40:27.978 --> 03:40:29.139]  They're very childlike.
[03:40:29.139 --> 03:40:30.179]  Facts mean nothing.
[03:40:30.179 --> 03:40:33.722]  And it's this petty power trip that they're part of the state.
[03:40:33.722 --> 03:40:34.862]  They're part of the system.
[03:40:34.862 --> 03:40:35.903]  They're winners.
[03:40:35.903 --> 03:40:38.645]  But that very system is destroying their future as well.
[03:40:38.645 --> 03:40:46.950]  And as you know, as someone who's researched history, once you get into one big lie, then it's a bigger lie, a bigger lie, and then things accelerate at the end.
[03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:56.677]  And do you agree that we're now reaching that acceleration point where all of this preparatory slide into tyranny and corruption has seemed fast, but we ain't seen nothing yet?
[03:40:57.357 --> 03:40:58.477]  Yes, that's true.
[03:40:58.477 --> 03:41:06.860]  And if you look at the complicity of the federal courts, even the Supreme Court, I mean, how quiet they've been and tolerant of this.
[03:41:06.860 --> 03:41:16.542]  And the law schools, and the law deans, and the Bar Association, the law firms, wherever you look, it's just acceptance.
[03:41:16.542 --> 03:41:19.183]  There's essentially acceptance of this.
[03:41:20.959 --> 03:41:27.021]  You would have thought that all the prestigious law schools would be on their high horse, the Bar Association.
[03:41:27.021 --> 03:41:29.482]  People would be screaming, what are you doing?
[03:41:29.482 --> 03:41:33.984]  You can't destroy civil liberties on the basis of a hoax.
[03:41:33.984 --> 03:41:42.168]  But that's exactly what's happening, and people are accepting it, and they just try to find some way to make money out of it, you know?
[03:41:42.168 --> 03:41:50.531]  Well, the point I make is, all these people that dehumanize Iraqis or Afghans or others, or the Serbs,
[03:41:51.801 --> 03:41:54.042]  Or the South Ossetians.
[03:41:54.042 --> 03:42:04.507]  They have to understand that 100% of the time in history, when you get sucked in by an imperial spirit of evil, and it's like a team spirit,
[03:42:05.672 --> 03:42:09.475]  Once you do that, it's always visited on you.
[03:42:09.475 --> 03:42:10.755]  It always comes back.
[03:42:10.755 --> 03:42:18.681]  The system has a desire, and they will carry it out on all of these people that have gone along with it.
[03:42:18.681 --> 03:42:19.681]  Exactly.
[03:42:19.681 --> 03:42:23.204]  Well look, what happened to Hitler's brown shirts?
[03:42:23.204 --> 03:42:26.706]  First thing he did when he had real power was turn on the brown shirts and destroy them.
[03:42:28.106 --> 03:42:29.846]  They were all killed, arrested.
[03:42:29.846 --> 03:42:30.706]  Don't you remember that?
[03:42:30.706 --> 03:42:45.569]  I mean, this is one of the key things in the Nazi history, that the brown shirts that marched through the streets for Hitler and, you know, attacked all the Jews, the Kristallnacht, all of that stuff, all of this violent crowd.
[03:42:45.569 --> 03:42:48.510]  The first thing Hitler did was to eliminate them.
[03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:50.850]  So you're exactly right.
[03:42:50.850 --> 03:42:53.070]  That's exactly what happens.
[03:42:53.070 --> 03:42:54.391]  Well, that's what Stalin did.
[03:42:54.391 --> 03:42:56.171]  Look what Stalin did to the Bolsheviks.
[03:42:56.846 --> 03:42:58.927]  The Bolsheviks made the revolution, so you eliminate it.
[03:42:58.927 --> 03:42:59.287]  That's right.
[03:42:59.287 --> 03:43:00.808]  That's exactly...
[03:43:26.627 --> 03:43:27.547]  That's exactly that.
[03:43:27.547 --> 03:43:44.515]  Once it starts, it... And then, of course, the police have to prove that they're on the government's side, and the way you do that, you're always producing new terrorists, or new enemies of the people, or, you know, the KGB and the Stalin, they used to have what they called street suites.
[03:43:44.515 --> 03:43:49.557]  The officers would just go down the street and arrest everybody on the street.
[03:43:49.557 --> 03:43:51.338]  By the way, two weeks into the gulag,
[03:43:52.020 --> 03:44:11.344]  Wow, two weeks ago a bunch of articles came out at the same time about police admitting quotas, and not just for parking tickets or speeding, but to just arrest people, and federal marshals have come out and said they're meant to put people on terror list for no reason in the airports, and that there are quotas to create the perception that there are all these criminals.
[03:44:11.344 --> 03:44:14.145]  Right, that's exactly it.
[03:44:14.145 --> 03:44:17.886]  I mean, it's out of control, I think, as you emphasize.
[03:44:18.527 --> 03:44:19.408]  It's out of control.
[03:44:19.408 --> 03:44:25.632]  I don't know whether they have any kind of specific plan that they're implementing step by step.
[03:44:25.632 --> 03:44:27.513]  I don't think things happen that way.
[03:44:27.513 --> 03:44:34.598]  I think it's just people, bullies, people who want power, they see opportunities to get it, they grab it.
[03:44:35.262 --> 03:45:01.282]  Well, I agree with you, Doctor, but there's a National Law Enforcement Think Tank Council, and Arne Saavedra takes blood without warrants, Total Police State shuts down gun shows without any law, just thuggishly just does it under Fed control, and it turns out he was picked by the Feds from California, brought here, and is now the frontrunner for Dallas, and this secretive National Council is telling Dallas to hire him, and then if they do, federal funds come in.
[03:45:01.282 --> 03:45:02.203]  Yeah.
[03:45:02.203 --> 03:45:03.324]  Well, I'm not in the lead.
[03:45:04.454 --> 03:45:07.655]  I'm not the least surprised.
[03:45:07.655 --> 03:45:09.856]  We're running out of time for the economy.
[03:45:09.856 --> 03:45:11.436]  You want to do anything on that?
[03:45:11.436 --> 03:45:13.257]  Absolutely, sir.
[03:45:13.257 --> 03:45:19.019]  In fact, let's get into the carbon tax, the value-added, where all this is going.
[03:45:19.019 --> 03:45:19.899]  Okay.
[03:45:19.899 --> 03:45:20.660]  You ready?
[03:45:20.660 --> 03:45:21.040]  Yes, sir.
[03:45:21.040 --> 03:45:30.243]  Alright, well, they're coming up with these taxes because they have bankrupted the Federal Treasury and, of course, the states.
[03:45:31.722 --> 03:45:36.045]  And this is endangering the dollar.
[03:45:36.045 --> 03:45:39.226]  And if the dollar cracks, their power goes with it.
[03:45:39.226 --> 03:45:48.651]  I mean, what could really, what would stop the American empire in its tracks would be the failure of the dollar as reserve currency.
[03:45:48.651 --> 03:45:51.313]  Because that's what American power is based on.
[03:45:51.313 --> 03:45:52.854]  It's not based on anything else.
[03:45:52.854 --> 03:45:56.596]  It's based on the dollar as reserve currency.
[03:45:57.862 --> 03:46:08.389]  Their bank bailouts and their wars have produced such massive deficits that they cannot be financed by world savings.
[03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:19.095]  And so, I mean, even if the other countries were still willing to buy the Treasury bonds, there's just not enough world savings to finance the United States government's deficit.
[03:46:19.095 --> 03:46:26.000]  So they have the dollar in danger and their powers in danger, so they've got to find some new tax revenues.
[03:46:26.892 --> 03:46:32.174]  And so that's what the value-added tax is about, because it's like a sales tax.
[03:46:32.174 --> 03:46:36.135]  You can't avoid it except by not purchasing.
[03:46:36.135 --> 03:46:43.118]  And if you don't buy anything, then you don't have to pay that tax.
[03:46:43.118 --> 03:46:55.042]  Now, the carbon tax, in my opinion, is just another charade that the corporations came up with because it lets them buy and sell the right to pollute.
[03:46:56.331 --> 03:47:03.917]  So they can turn environmental damaging action pollution into a profit-making venture.
[03:47:03.917 --> 03:47:18.948]  So that's what the carbon tax does, and the corporations of course are all in favor of it because they can now buy it and sell it, and Wall Street wants it because they'll turn it into derivatives.
[03:47:18.948 --> 03:47:22.710]  You know, the right to pollute becomes valuable.
[03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:24.692]  And so that's
[03:47:25.888 --> 03:47:28.929]  That's what that's about.
[03:47:28.929 --> 03:47:30.109]  So what happened?
[03:47:30.109 --> 03:47:43.332]  So here we have the American people, the middle class is essentially destroyed because there have been no new middle class jobs, no net new middle class jobs in a decade.
[03:47:43.332 --> 03:47:51.774]  So all the people who graduate from college and have hopes and all that, there's nothing for them to do.
[03:47:51.774 --> 03:47:53.035]  Engineers can't find work.
[03:47:55.057 --> 03:47:57.719]  So they close us down.
[03:47:57.719 --> 03:48:07.206]  There's no growth in the income of the average American except for the 1% super-rich, whose income is growing phenomenally.
[03:48:07.206 --> 03:48:08.747]  So there's no income growth.
[03:48:08.747 --> 03:48:11.168]  People have lost their jobs.
[03:48:11.168 --> 03:48:17.473]  The real unemployment rate is around 22%.
[03:48:17.473 --> 03:48:24.498]  So you have all these people out of work, losing their homes, and now they want to make them pay a very added tax.
[03:48:26.297 --> 03:48:34.543]  So the effect of all this is to drive the people into the ground.
[03:48:34.543 --> 03:48:39.006]  It's the most destructive thing that you can do.
[03:48:39.006 --> 03:48:40.267]  You drive them into the ground.
[03:48:40.267 --> 03:48:44.731]  You make them more desperate.
[03:48:44.731 --> 03:48:51.015]  Right now, you know, there's still some fat in the system.
[03:48:51.015 --> 03:48:52.496]  Some parents still have money.
[03:48:52.496 --> 03:48:55.719]  The kids can come live at home even though they've got college degrees.
[03:48:57.074 --> 03:48:59.855]  But all of that drains away.
[03:48:59.855 --> 03:49:14.543]  And so, this is probably the first time in history where a government has intentionally destroyed its own population.
[03:49:14.543 --> 03:49:25.668]  The economic prospects of American people are being destroyed by the government that they elect, that they think represents them and has their
[03:49:26.232 --> 03:49:29.074]  They have a term for it, command destruction
[03:49:56.437 --> 03:50:03.919]  And it vertically integrates the economy, accelerates the power of the super-rich, but destroys the engine of wealth development.
[03:50:03.919 --> 03:50:19.762]  But when you look at Maurice Strong in 1992, and you look at what all these other environmentalists have said, and you look at the head of NASA Climatology, he says, it is our job, this is a credo, a maxim, to destroy the industrial society.
[03:50:19.762 --> 03:50:23.443]  And this is feudalism, this is absolute despotism.
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:28.001]  Yes, I think that's true.
[03:50:28.001 --> 03:50:36.585]  The real question is, what can the United States government do about China and Russia?
[03:50:36.585 --> 03:50:38.385]  Let's talk about that when we come back, Doctor.
[03:50:38.385 --> 03:50:44.688]  Final segment, I'll see if I can twist your arm for another five, because I realize this is one of our last interviews with you, at least for a long time.
[03:50:44.688 --> 03:50:49.070]  You said you wanted to come on on Tax Day, that was a great idea, so we'll look forward to seeing you next week.
[03:50:50.385 --> 03:50:51.186]  We're going to come back.
[03:50:51.186 --> 03:50:54.008]  I'm going to try to give you the floor because you're talking about such important things.
[03:50:54.008 --> 03:50:55.389]  Your knowledge is so great.
[03:50:55.389 --> 03:51:00.493]  We'll also tell people about your newly published book if people want to learn more.
[03:51:00.493 --> 03:51:01.754]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:01.754 --> 03:51:08.999]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[03:51:08.999 --> 03:51:12.622]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[03:51:12.922 --> 03:51:21.245]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[03:51:21.245 --> 03:51:24.147]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[03:51:24.147 --> 03:51:26.928]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[03:51:26.928 --> 03:51:31.369]  Thieves get near you, push a button, and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[03:51:31.369 --> 03:51:32.750]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:35.111]  Visit IDStronghold.com.

[03:52:05.843 --> 03:52:07.104]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:07.104 --> 03:52:10.968]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:10.968 --> 03:52:13.270]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.270 --> 03:52:19.136]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.136 --> 03:52:25.363]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:25.803 --> 03:52:31.784]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:31.784 --> 03:52:35.945]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:52:35.945 --> 03:52:40.226]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:40.226 --> 03:52:46.188]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:46.188 --> 03:52:49.728]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:49.728 --> 03:52:51.709]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:51.709 --> 03:52:52.149]  It's here.

[03:53:54.142 --> 03:53:54.482]  Big John!
[03:54:07.631 --> 03:54:10.053]  Dr. Paul Greg Roberts is our guest.
[03:54:10.053 --> 03:54:16.456]  Doc, before we get into China and the geopolitical breakdown, tell folks about your latest book.
[03:54:16.456 --> 03:54:18.938]  Well, it's how the economy was lost.
[03:54:18.938 --> 03:54:33.646]  It tells how the offshoring of jobs, for example, has prevented the growth of middle class jobs for over a decade and has suppressed the growth of American incomes and
[03:54:34.298 --> 03:54:41.024]  It made the economy totally dependent on debt expansion, which has now, of course, ruined everyone because they can't pay their debts.
[03:54:41.024 --> 03:54:43.165]  They're living in their homes.
[03:54:43.165 --> 03:54:56.416]  And it also then discusses the whole hoax of free trade, the free trade cloak for offshoring.
[03:54:56.416 --> 03:54:58.558]  Offshoring is not free trade.
[03:54:58.558 --> 03:55:00.560]  It's not any kind of trade.
[03:55:00.560 --> 03:55:01.801]  It's labor arbitrage.
[03:55:01.801 --> 03:55:03.262]  And I also discussed
[03:55:06.369 --> 03:55:23.977]  The most impressive failures in economic theory are the games that economists play to hide the defects in their models that are helping us move along the road to economic Armageddon.
[03:55:23.977 --> 03:55:32.801]  It's all written in very accessible languages, no formulas, no arcane words, and essentially
[03:55:34.071 --> 03:55:46.433]  Well, Doc, in the time we've got left, geopolitically, with the different power blocks that are out there, you are getting into China.
[03:56:01.297 --> 03:56:04.699]  There's no doubt that the United States is on a hegemonic path.
[03:56:04.699 --> 03:56:07.561]  It wants to be the world hegemon.
[03:56:07.561 --> 03:56:09.462]  You know, you approach it various ways.
[03:56:09.462 --> 03:56:23.470]  It's the new world order and the planned world government and so forth, but there's no indication whatsoever that Russia or China is on this path or would go along with it.
[03:56:23.470 --> 03:56:29.453]  And so the question is, what does the United States government do about Russia and China?
[03:56:30.225 --> 03:56:38.108]  China, because they're clearly obstacles to American domination of the world.
[03:56:38.108 --> 03:56:47.972]  And now Russia is relatively weak, but it has an unlimited number of nuclear missiles that can blow us up many times over.
[03:56:47.972 --> 03:56:58.957]  And of course, the Chinese economy now is, in terms of industry, manufacturing, it greatly surpasses the United States economy.
[03:56:58.957 --> 03:56:59.737]  I mean, there's steel,
[03:57:00.356 --> 03:57:04.099]  Production, for example, is many times ours.
[03:57:04.099 --> 03:57:09.843]  Their heavy equipment, their manufacturing, advanced technology.
[03:57:09.843 --> 03:57:16.648]  We're a second-rate economy compared to Chinese industry and manufacturing.
[03:57:16.648 --> 03:57:19.650]  So how can we shove them aside?
[03:57:19.650 --> 03:57:22.172]  Of course, they're also our biggest predator.
[03:57:22.651 --> 03:57:24.352]  Well, we know how they plan that.
[03:57:24.352 --> 03:57:28.576]  Emergency in Kyrgyzstan as police fire on protesters.
[03:57:28.576 --> 03:57:31.818]  The CIA is admittedly in all the major stands.
[03:57:31.818 --> 03:57:33.459]  It's in Georgia.
[03:57:33.459 --> 03:57:38.183]  It's encircling China and financing rebels to attack these countries.
[03:57:38.183 --> 03:57:41.586]  And that's why the Communist Chinese are getting hopping mad.
[03:57:41.586 --> 03:57:42.967]  Well, you're right.
[03:57:42.967 --> 03:57:45.088]  That's what the CIA is doing.
[03:57:45.088 --> 03:57:50.833]  But the Russians and the Chinese, unlike the American people, are aware of it.
[03:57:52.362 --> 03:57:57.387]  And I don't think they'll sit there indefinitely, passively.
[03:57:57.387 --> 03:58:02.631]  And so something, they're likely to do something.
[03:58:02.631 --> 03:58:11.119]  And both of them have various powerful responses that they could make short of a military attack.
[03:58:11.119 --> 03:58:15.183]  So the Russians can cut Europe off from natural gas.
[03:58:16.717 --> 03:58:28.220]  In fact, the Russians could punish severely these various stands that we're now operating in, the former constituent parts of the Soviet Union.
[03:58:28.220 --> 03:58:33.122]  The Chinese could certainly cause us a lot of financial worries.
[03:58:33.122 --> 03:58:34.162]  Doc, stay there.
[03:58:34.162 --> 03:58:34.502]  Stay there.
[03:58:34.502 --> 03:58:36.843]  We're coming right back after this quick break.
