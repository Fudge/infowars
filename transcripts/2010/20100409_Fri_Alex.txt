[00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:08.321]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:09.783]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:11.485]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:15.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:20.357]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:23.192]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:24.492]  It is April 9th, 2010.
[00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:28.514]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:36.377]  We have Bob Chapman coming up in the second hour, and we are joined by Mark Dice for the entire first hour.
[00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:43.820]  Of course, Mark Dice is featured in my newest documentary, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.481]  And I did this film
[00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:51.487]  Because of really the lack of knowledge out in the culture right now.
[00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:55.791]  And even out in the culture when I was asleep ten years ago now.
[00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:59.054]  I had no idea about this stuff.
[00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:02.097]  And Mark, it really saddens me to see a
[00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:18.210]  A society, a once great society of manufactured, cloned puppets that suck on pop culture and really are so involved in the minutia of their favorite sports team or their favorite celebrity that they cannot see what's really going on around them.
[00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:22.797]  No, and that is part of the New World Order to distract everybody with bread and circus.
[00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:25.118]  And that's why I'm really looking forward to this film.
[00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:25.919]  Congratulations.
[00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.721]  It looks absolutely amazing.
[00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:31.042]  And that is what they need.
[00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:36.486]  That's why the New World Order has been able to succeed, obviously, because people aren't politically aware.
[00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:45.832]  And I think the time is right with this now, because you have a segment of the population after 9-11 that knew that it was an inside job or that we're just against the wars in general.
[00:01:46.613 --> 00:01:48.615]  That's one particular issue.
[00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:53.919]  There's a large segment of the population that obviously supported the war or just were really indifferent.
[00:01:53.959 --> 00:02:00.123]  But now that the economic collapse has happened, a lot of people are looking for answers as to why, as to who to blame.
[00:02:00.624 --> 00:02:01.684]  They're getting worried.
[00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:07.989]  And so now everybody's lives are affected because, you know, with 9-11, a lot of people were disconnected.
[00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:12.072]  They didn't feel a personal connection to the war, to the soldiers.
[00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:13.173]  They didn't feel that
[00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:19.957]  You know, sending the soldiers over to die necessarily affected them, but now everybody's pocketbook is affected.
[00:02:19.977 --> 00:02:21.838]  Everybody's talking about the economic collapse.
[00:02:21.898 --> 00:02:32.625]  Everybody wants to know, you know, what group, what sort of backroom deals led to this collapse and is continuing to just run the country down the toilet.
[00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:34.906]  And so I think this is just fantastic.
[00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.547]  I think this is the primer.
[00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:40.069]  It looks better than any History Channel show I've ever seen.
[00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.910]  I mean, this is going
[00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:43.521]  Well, thank you so much, Mark.
[00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:46.042]  And as you were talking about the economy, you're right.
[00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:51.544]  Now that the Obama administration is in, we are bringing in so-called conservatives.
[00:02:51.584 --> 00:03:01.288]  Of course, you and I know that there is a false left-right paradigm out there to control both of us, to make us really choose sides and think we're part of a team.
[00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:02.608]  I got news for you, folks.
[00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:04.669]  We're not part of any team at all.
[00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:05.289]  I don't
[00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:30.209]  It's 20 plus percent in this country don't believe the hype.
[00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:40.273]  He's saying to avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among, and it won't be a choice, they'll be doing all of these things, among higher taxes.
[00:03:40.293 --> 00:03:41.773]  So they're going to raise your taxes.
[00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:47.855]  They're already taking 20, 30, sometimes 40 and 50 percent, depending on what tax bracket you're in.
[00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:57.901]  Modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and those aren't entitlement programs, those are programs we've paid into our entire lives forcibly through our paychecks.
[00:03:58.101 --> 00:03:59.382]  We don't really get a choice there.
[00:03:59.902 --> 00:04:04.865]  So they're going to take away those programs and raise taxes and now they're out in the open talking about it, Mark.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:19.523]  Yeah, and another note that I want to talk to about tax is obviously Tax Day, April 15th, also the release of Invisible Empire, also the deadline for your extortion check to be sent in to the federal government for your income tax.
[00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:27.565]  And so a lot of people, obviously, in this movement, in this audience, are involved in seeing how the tax scheme is a fraud.
[00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:33.566]  Everybody's probably seen Aaron Russo's film, America, Freedom from Fascism, and some people might just think, well, I'm just not going to pay him.
[00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:45.092]  And I just want to urge you that I've done that before and I can tell you that after about a year or so we'll catch up to you and you'll pay heavy fines and they're going to garnish your check.
[00:04:45.132 --> 00:04:52.595]  So even though, yes, the income tax is a fraud, it needs to be taken care of on a legislative level and if you just don't pay taxes... We'll talk about that more on the other side.
[00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:53.575]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:56.896]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.596]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:07.440]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.846]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.251]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:18.332]  We also have some specials.

[00:05:33.442 --> 00:05:35.003]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:05:35.283 --> 00:05:36.204]  Everybody needs to get it.

[00:06:04.143 --> 00:06:05.043]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.403 --> 00:06:09.144]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:11.545]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:17.026]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.426 --> 00:06:23.668]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.088 --> 00:06:29.652]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.072 --> 00:06:33.755]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:38.278]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:47.385]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:49.468]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:50.489]  It's here.

[00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:07.283]  Dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:07:07.804 --> 00:07:13.385]  America's government is no longer the servant of the people and the protector of our liberty, but has become that fearful master.
[00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:19.146]  We the people must understand the nature of this government gone awry if we are to be successful in saving our country.
[00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:26.348]  America is being deliberately destroyed by a cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced into subjugation to a one-world government.
[00:07:26.648 --> 00:07:30.309]  The God-given, unalienable rights of the Declaration of Independence are in jeopardy.
[00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:33.732]  We must not let them be stolen by ambitious and evil men.
[00:07:34.092 --> 00:07:39.737]  Utopia Silver Supplements believes it is our God-given right to make our own healthcare decisions however we deem best.

[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.486]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:11.110]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.851 --> 00:08:13.172]  We are back live.
[00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:14.053]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:15.534]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:08:15.554 --> 00:08:20.459]  We're streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:21.961]  We're joined by Mark Dice.
[00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:29.026]  And I want to talk a little bit about this, because there's a crowd out there that doesn't pay their taxes, that thinks that common law is the answer.
[00:08:29.307 --> 00:08:35.171]  But what they don't understand is by paying your taxes, you stay out of their crosshairs and their system further.
[00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:38.334]  I mean, tell us your experience with not paying your taxes, Mark.
[00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:40.355]  We admit it's not legal.
[00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:41.777]  We promote freedom to fascism.
[00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:43.498]  We're trying to get the information out there.
[00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:46.741]  But at the same time, we don't want to end up in a prison cell.
[00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:50.924]  We don't want the very little assets that we actually have taken away or garnished.
[00:08:51.204 --> 00:08:52.425]  Yeah, it is extortion.
[00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:53.706]  We're all in agreement on that.
[00:08:53.746 --> 00:08:56.888]  And about five years ago, I just decided to just not pay.
[00:08:56.988 --> 00:08:58.229]  I just didn't even file.
[00:08:58.249 --> 00:08:59.930]  I just said, forget about it, you know?
[00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.292]  And they sent me a few letters saying, yeah, you forgot to file.
[00:09:04.312 --> 00:09:05.933]  And of course, I just ignored all of them.
[00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:08.435]  And I just figured it would go away.
[00:09:09.876 --> 00:09:17.020]  And they started garnishing my wages at my day job, which, of course, I should have known that they were going to do.
[00:09:17.121 --> 00:09:17.701]  I just didn't
[00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:21.656]  Realize that, yeah, a year goes by and I figure they just forgot about it.
[00:09:21.676 --> 00:09:22.436]  No, no.
[00:09:22.817 --> 00:09:29.299]  Started garnishing my wages and I think I paid over a $500 fine and interest and all this stuff.
[00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:36.121]  But, you know, yesterday I posted a message on my Facebook page just reminding people to get their taxes done on time.
[00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:40.162]  You know, pay your extortion check on time so you don't have to pay the fines and the interest.
[00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:48.668]  There's a couple guys on there that were saying, Oh, you're just funding, you know, you shouldn't be complaining about the new world order because you're just funding them.
[00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:50.190]  You're just paying their check.
[00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.015]  You know, you're, you're sending them the money to have them build a new world order.
[00:09:54.555 --> 00:09:56.457]  And you, you shouldn't even complain about it.
[00:09:56.478 --> 00:09:57.298]  I'm just thinking, well,
[00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:01.862]  You know, I actually agree that the taxes are illegal.
[00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:08.567]  It is extortion, but we need to take care of this on a legislative level by just simply not paying your taxes.
[00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:11.929]  It may seem like you're protesting, but honestly, you're just a number.
[00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:12.910]  They don't care.
[00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.332]  They're going to start garnishing your wages.
[00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:16.773]  They're going to come to your door.
[00:10:17.113 --> 00:10:18.654]  They will seize your assets.
[00:10:18.794 --> 00:10:25.559]  And so there's a better way to fight the tax revolt than there is just to simply not pay.
[00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:28.541]  And people, Mark, they think that there's a silver bullet out there.
[00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:31.502]  They think that there's these solutions that are going to happen overnight.
[00:10:31.562 --> 00:10:32.603]  I have the solution.
[00:10:32.643 --> 00:10:39.046]  They believe in phony documents and underground SEAL teams that are ready to save us at a moment's notice.
[00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:40.727]  No, that's not how the world works.
[00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:42.468]  You have to work towards a goal.
[00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:44.009]  You have to gain momentum.
[00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:47.671]  You have to get people behind an idea and you have to mobilize them.
[00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:52.393]  I think that civil disobedience is one of the greatest ways that we can achieve these kind of goals.
[00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:54.994]  But first, we have to educate the public.
[00:10:55.034 --> 00:11:09.681]  We have to explain to them their methods, their modes of control, the organizations out there that really do matter, that do pull the strings, that set the policy, that sit in the boardrooms and decide what your and my life is going to look like in the next five to ten years.
[00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:14.103]  We get more people like Congressman Ron Paul on our side.
[00:11:14.323 --> 00:11:17.164]  We start taking part in massive past-day protests.
[00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:23.083]  Uh, just getting hundreds of thousands, millions of people in multiple cities clamoring.
[00:11:23.103 --> 00:11:23.584]  We use films.
[00:11:25.026 --> 00:11:28.247]  Like Invisible Empire and others to educate those that aren't aware.
[00:11:28.527 --> 00:11:32.329]  You know, some people in the audience may think that they already know everything that there is to know.
[00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:40.532]  Maybe they're obsessed with researching this as we are, but I can guarantee you that there's stuff out there and little aspects of this that we don't know about.
[00:11:40.572 --> 00:11:44.934]  And I, myself, become very educated even from your films and from other films.
[00:11:45.014 --> 00:11:49.316]  And as much as I obsess about this and research this, I certainly don't know everything.
[00:11:50.096 --> 00:11:54.979]  And so the films are great, especially some people think, oh, this is just the same old stuff rehashed.
[00:11:55.299 --> 00:11:56.980]  Well, then maybe it's not for you.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.141]  Maybe it's for your friends and your family.
[00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:07.686]  And so instead of sending them a link to a YouTube video and saying, here, check this out, maybe you should have everybody over for a party and watch it on your 50-inch flat screen.
[00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:09.707]  And that's how you're going to get the message across.
[00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:10.667]  Is everybody still busy?
[00:12:10.767 --> 00:12:13.489]  Send someone a link to one-tenth of the part of
[00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:22.926]  I think I saw Alex did a quick video urging viewing parties, which is probably the best thing to do because I'd rather watch it on a 50-inch flat screen than watching it on a tiny little laptop computer.
[00:12:39.722 --> 00:12:45.164]  Or you have it at your local church or community center and you get one of those projectors and it's actually on a movie screen.
[00:12:45.204 --> 00:12:47.945]  I can't tell you how many times we did that with loose change and loose change.
[00:12:48.345 --> 00:12:48.965]  Final cut.
[00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:53.586]  In fact, I want to play a sneak peek right now of Invisible Empire.
[00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:57.808]  And this is a section dealing with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:12:58.108 --> 00:13:01.389]  It features G. Edward Griffin and we're going to come back after that.
[00:13:01.409 --> 00:13:06.370]  So this is a brand new sneak peek of my latest film coming out April 15th, Tax Day.
[00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.631]  Invisible Empire, a new world order to find.
[00:13:10.353 --> 00:13:17.475]  Here's a short sneak peek from the Council on Foreign Relations Roundtable Group section from Invisible Empire.
[00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:25.558]  In all of the British dependencies, these organizations, the front groups, were called the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:28.782]  In the United States, they chose a different name.
[00:13:29.322 --> 00:13:31.883]  They chose the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:13:32.364 --> 00:13:38.426]  But it held exactly the same relationship to this inner society of Cecil Rhodes.
[00:13:38.907 --> 00:13:54.594]  Among the charter members were W. Averill Harriman of Union Banking, then President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson's main advisor, Colonel Edward Mendel House, John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil, banking mogul J.P.
[00:13:54.614 --> 00:13:54.934]  Morgan,
[00:14:02.888 --> 00:14:05.109]  Well, the Council on Foreign Relations exists today.
[00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:09.029]  It's probably the most powerful single organization in America.
[00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:16.711]  Many observers, including myself, believe that it is the hidden government of the United States.
[00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:21.392]  These people are not elected to office, and most Americans don't even know who they are.
[00:14:22.893 --> 00:14:26.336]  But they are holding all of the important positions in society.
[00:14:26.356 --> 00:14:28.938]  There are only about 4,000 of them in the United States.
[00:14:29.378 --> 00:14:41.568]  But I don't care what organization you want to look at, whether it's government, or whether it's universities, or the large media centers, or whatever it is, you look at the people at the tops of those organizations.
[00:14:42.308 --> 00:14:59.726]  The owners, the managers, the CEOs, the board of directors, and I'm going to say probably 80 to 90% of the great power centers of America are dominated by just those 4,000 people who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:15:00.253 --> 00:15:16.916]  That was just a short clip from Invisible Empire where we're chronicling how the shadow government controls society through groups like the Council on Foreign Relations that operate as front groups for the roundtable group intelligence systems that control our society from behind the throne.
[00:15:19.622 --> 00:15:25.067]  There it is, folks, Invisible Empire, a new world order to find at PrisonPlanet.tv first, and we're streaming there live.
[00:15:25.107 --> 00:15:31.113]  I also want to remind people to support Ecolablue.com, Ecolablue fresh water from the air.
[00:15:31.153 --> 00:15:32.794]  You don't even need a source.
[00:15:32.854 --> 00:15:35.497]  It makes up to seven and a half gallons of water per day.
[00:15:35.557 --> 00:15:37.438]  Call them at 1-800-691-6043 or go to Ecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[00:15:43.724 --> 00:15:45.906]  Mark, that's just a small snippet of my film.
[00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:47.587]  It's 2 hours and 12 minutes.
[00:15:47.827 --> 00:16:04.218]  I really think that G. Edward Griffin, being one of the primary characters in the Patriot movement, somebody who's been around for, I believe, 50 plus years, he made movies like Katanga, The Capitalist Conspiracy, back in the 70s, when really all she had was, well,
[00:16:04.878 --> 00:16:06.498]  Not even a PowerPoint presentation.
[00:16:06.538 --> 00:16:08.919]  It was literally slides on a projector.
[00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:29.024]  And to progress to the level where we're using After Effects, we're using Final Cut Pro, we're not only getting to the level of the History Channel, but surpassing it in many ways, is very exciting to me because I feel like not only are we going to reach a younger audience, a newer audience, but it's going to hold true with our already great audience out there who can make copies and hand it out to people.
[00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:45.059]  And unfortunately, you can put together a tremendous film or even just a videotape of a speech of somebody and this isn't going to have the impact because we're so used to the MTV style, quick graphics and just incredible sound.
[00:16:45.099 --> 00:16:47.821]  And so that, you know, you're sort of playing their game.
[00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:49.883]  You're culture jamming the system.
[00:16:49.903 --> 00:16:54.428]  You're using their own game against them, which I think is fantastic.
[00:16:55.285 --> 00:17:07.912]  Well, I've often talked to you about how we're going to win this thing, and I said if we don't have our own media arm, if we don't have our own competition for CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News, we truly are going to be doomed.
[00:17:07.952 --> 00:17:19.618]  We do need something like InfoWars and Prison Planet that pumps out 25 stories a day, that pumps out three or four documentaries a year, that keeps up on the activism front, that keeps people
[00:17:20.098 --> 00:17:23.179]  In tune with the real news, the real issues.
[00:17:23.239 --> 00:17:35.082]  How else are we supposed to compete with literal multi-billion and trillion dollar corporations like General Electric and Westinghouse that own NBC and all of these other huge networks?
[00:17:35.602 --> 00:17:44.685]  Well, that's why the Alex Jones Radio Show is fantastic, too, because we do need, you know, a daily radio show of several hours because, I mean, what are you going to choose from?
[00:17:44.805 --> 00:17:47.886]  Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, I mean,
[00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:59.753]  You know, even if you're a conservative, okay, some of their issues that they talk about might be interesting, but once you understand that they aren't just a bunch of propagandists and a bunch of gatekeepers, you need some sort of an alternative.
[00:18:00.153 --> 00:18:06.254]  So, you know, the Alex Jones Show, other shows like it, are just perfect because you can sit there and you can download the mp3.
[00:18:06.454 --> 00:18:07.614]  They have the great guests.
[00:18:07.874 --> 00:18:10.215]  Occasionally, the mainstream media will get a guest.
[00:18:10.775 --> 00:18:18.301]  Gerald Cilente on or Peter Schiff but you know that's very rare and it's for one segment so you maybe get five minutes of their knowledge.
[00:18:18.521 --> 00:18:35.415]  So you get Alex Jones Show, other shows, your show and you know you can get these people on there and you'll interview them for a half an hour, 45 minutes or for a full hour to get a more comprehensive understanding instead of just a soundbite mentality of the rare occurrence that Peter Schiff or any of these other
[00:18:36.089 --> 00:18:36.711]  We're good to go.
[00:18:45.214 --> 00:18:52.121]  Absolutely, and when you're listening to this mainline garbage, you're fitting the mold that they're really crafting for you.
[00:18:52.181 --> 00:18:54.744]  They want you to be on one side or the other.
[00:18:54.764 --> 00:18:56.225]  They don't want you to look at both sides.
[00:18:56.305 --> 00:19:07.317]  I often look at both sides of the picture, the right perspective, the left perspective, and of course our perspective, so that I can take those and analyze them and find out what is the real
[00:19:07.697 --> 00:19:07.977]  Deal.
[00:19:08.057 --> 00:19:09.718]  What does the evidence point towards?
[00:19:09.818 --> 00:19:11.019]  What can we do to stop this?
[00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:14.561]  How do we educate people about these issues?
[00:19:14.582 --> 00:19:21.806]  And obviously, like you said, the economy is a huge hot-button issue and it's being manipulated on all fronts right now.
[00:19:22.126 --> 00:19:26.029]  In fact, the New York Times is running a headline when they're saying, why so glum?
[00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:27.710]  Numbers point to a recovery.
[00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:37.039]  Yes, they point to a recovery when the banks are giving out record numbers to their own associates while they take your pension funds.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.244]  That's right, record bonuses for their guys as they take your pension funds.
[00:19:41.444 --> 00:19:43.847]  As Bernanke gets up and says we have to raise taxes.
[00:19:44.107 --> 00:19:47.891]  Back after this, it's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:19:59.659 --> 00:20:03.801]  How would you like to own a pair of the most unique gloves in the world?

[00:20:59.748 --> 00:21:02.048]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:04.309]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:07.310]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.412]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:16.953]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.273 --> 00:21:19.615]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:19.735 --> 00:21:22.177]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.497 --> 00:21:25.080]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:33.006]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.346 --> 00:21:38.611]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:38.751 --> 00:21:41.013]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.053 --> 00:21:45.036]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.276 --> 00:21:46.197]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.357 --> 00:21:47.658]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:47.698 --> 00:21:48.699]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:58.968 --> 00:22:01.669]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:05.870]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.151]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:08.331 --> 00:22:13.352]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:22:13.492 --> 00:22:15.253]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:16.613]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:22:16.853 --> 00:22:18.314]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:22:18.334 --> 00:22:21.435]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:26.757]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:36.180]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.242]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:41.604 --> 00:22:44.927]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.
[00:22:45.067 --> 00:22:48.790]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.991]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:51.172]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.765 --> 00:23:00.426]  Oh, my sinuses.
[00:23:00.487 --> 00:23:02.388]  They feel like they'll explode.
[00:23:02.448 --> 00:23:04.930]  Sinus pressure, sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.170]  You've struggled for years.
[00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:11.955]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:23:12.135 --> 00:23:12.735]  Sound familiar?
[00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:13.716]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:23:13.936 --> 00:23:17.398]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:23:17.578 --> 00:23:22.442]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[00:23:22.622 --> 00:23:25.024]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor recommended.
[00:23:30.998 --> 00:23:32.979]  It's the known causes of your sinusitis.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.403]  No alcohol, no rebound congestion, no drug interactions, and easy to use.
[00:23:37.643 --> 00:23:39.524]  Don't go another day just treating symptoms.
[00:23:39.724 --> 00:23:45.909]  Take control of your sinus health now and get Sinofresh homeopathic antiseptic nasal spray and get the relief you deserve.

[00:23:52.994 --> 00:23:53.315]  It works!
[00:24:28.482 --> 00:24:30.124]  And there's nothing but love in my heart.
[00:24:30.184 --> 00:24:32.385]  I am Jason Burmess, in for Alex Jones.
[00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:33.346]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:33.366 --> 00:24:35.448]  We're joined by Mark Dice.
[00:24:38.154 --> 00:24:53.194]  I really want to talk about being mesmerized, hypnotized by the system because, again, I can remember myself in 99, 2000, even after the 9-11 attacks without really looking into it, just being totally brain damaged and dead.
[00:24:53.815 --> 00:24:57.220]  It was only 9-11 that got me even involved in the mainstream media.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:04.489]  That's where I started watching these 24-hour news networks, starting to realize that geopolitics was important.
[00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.574]  Before that, I was watching Temptation Island.
[00:25:07.594 --> 00:25:09.957]  I was watching every garbage show that's out there.
[00:25:10.277 --> 00:25:17.704]  I would probably still be the guy watching Jersey Shore or some other crap like that if I hadn't awakened to the real system.
[00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:20.967]  In fact, later on tonight I'm going to be on Tap Out Radio.
[00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:31.737]  A lot of people out there know that I'm a huge MMA fan, but I'm going to have the opportunity for an hour to reach out to an audience that 90% of them probably don't have any idea what I'm going to talk about.
[00:25:32.077 --> 00:25:35.559]  I can introduce them to an idea like the New World Order.
[00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:45.806]  And quite frankly, when I first watched Road to Tyranny, Alex Jones' film, about 9-11, not only did I not want to believe it, but I was uncomfortable with the term New World Order.
[00:25:45.826 --> 00:25:49.568]  I was like, why doesn't this guy stick to global elite or something like this?
[00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:51.569]  New World Order makes him sound like a kook.
[00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:58.013]  It makes him sound like all those Christians that think that the world is going to end and the rapture is about to come here.
[00:25:58.033 --> 00:25:59.294]  I don't want to hear that.
[00:25:59.774 --> 00:26:04.521]  But as I progressed, Mark, as I learned more and more and more, I realized, hey, wait a minute.
[00:26:05.061 --> 00:26:06.543]  New World Order is their term.
[00:26:06.964 --> 00:26:08.646]  And that's why I made this film.
[00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:13.152]  I made this film because I'm taking their propaganda and using it against them.
[00:26:13.192 --> 00:26:14.734]  And I'm showing what it's really about.
[00:26:14.774 --> 00:26:17.658]  I'm exposing that a New World Order is truly
[00:26:18.138 --> 00:26:32.027]  A government in which the state is God, where they micromanage your entire life in a cashless society control grid, where your every single move is tracked, traced, and databased through an RFID implant, Mark, and you are a big part of this film.
[00:26:32.247 --> 00:26:37.231]  Why don't you speak to the fact that people can have awakenings, that they don't have to be drones all their lives?
[00:26:38.502 --> 00:26:43.823]  You know, we're not saying that you need to completely smash your television and never watch anything again.
[00:26:43.863 --> 00:26:47.764]  I mean, of course, with moderation, it's good to have your entertainment.
[00:26:47.804 --> 00:26:59.547]  You have your MMA fights for entertainment, and it's okay, but just... Most people watch as much television as they do as a person who has a part-time or even a full-time job.
[00:26:59.907 --> 00:27:00.767]  That's a problem.
[00:27:01.414 --> 00:27:04.977]  And so you have this high-tech system and our celebrities are built up.
[00:27:05.317 --> 00:27:08.879]  You know, let's just look at some of the celebrities and what they've done with their lives.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.922]  You have Sober House with Dr. Drew or Celebrity Rehab.
[00:27:12.962 --> 00:27:15.604]  You know, these icons that are built up.
[00:27:15.724 --> 00:27:17.565]  And that's what they've done with their lives.
[00:27:17.625 --> 00:27:19.206]  They have destroyed their lives.
[00:27:19.226 --> 00:27:25.210]  And that's really what the New World Order wants you to do so that you're not going to go to a protest, so that you're not going to be educated.
[00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.673]  So they want you to just waste away your life in this
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.281]  I think so.
[00:27:47.176 --> 00:27:50.437]  Am I wasting hours of my day or of my week?
[00:27:50.837 --> 00:27:53.577]  You know, could I be doing at least something more productive?
[00:27:54.097 --> 00:27:56.758]  Could I be having fun with my friends and family?
[00:27:56.798 --> 00:28:02.039]  Could I be out exercising, doing a hobby, you know, enjoying nature?
[00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:03.799]  Something to that effect.
[00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:14.681]  And that's a major goal of the New World Order is to hypnotize us to create a standard of both immorality and selfishness.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:24.270]  And some people criticize me all because I'm just a Christian, and I say this, but even from a secular standpoint, you have to admit that it's horrific what's happening in society.
[00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:28.795]  We have kids doing things that they really should not be doing.
[00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:34.281]  There's new phenomena going on in the culture that people are just utterly shocked.
[00:28:35.442 --> 00:28:36.122]  I'm shocked.
[00:28:36.142 --> 00:28:37.563]  I mean, Jason, we're about the same age.
[00:28:37.703 --> 00:28:41.945]  I'm only 32 and I still just look around at how much the world has changed in 10 years.
[00:28:42.065 --> 00:28:47.847]  No, I can't believe that 10-year-old girls idolize whores like Paris Hilton as if they're real celebrities.
[00:28:47.907 --> 00:28:56.170]  No, they're celebritards that were born into billions of dollars who have wasted their life on the literal most shallow things you could care about without having
[00:28:56.871 --> 00:29:00.175]  Any semblance of reality that surrounds them.
[00:29:00.216 --> 00:29:03.000]  They have no idea what the real world is like.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.866]  They spend their lives going around to these little parties, getting coked up.
[00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:11.873]  And little girls, small girls, your daughters, your nephews, your nieces...
[00:29:13.155 --> 00:29:18.459]  The people that are going to grow up and supposed to take care of you when you're old are not going to have a moral compass.
[00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:23.844]  They are going to watch things like celebrity rehab and think, you know what, I should be partying my entire life.
[00:29:23.864 --> 00:29:27.687]  They don't see that that could turn into them that they're going to crash and burn.
[00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:33.893]  No, they want to be like these rock star idiots out there that don't have any clue what's going on.
[00:29:34.093 --> 00:29:35.774]  But they don't realize it's never going to get that far.
[00:29:35.975 --> 00:29:40.879]  You're going to be a part of the system, a part of the New World Order slave grid.
[00:29:40.899 --> 00:29:41.759]  We'll be back after this.
[00:29:41.819 --> 00:29:42.700]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.741]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:47.424]  We're streaming live at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:49.906 --> 00:29:50.787]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.287 --> 00:29:52.889]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:56.492]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.563]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:02.983 --> 00:30:07.948]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:08.308 --> 00:30:10.050]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:15.175]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:16.256]  How much do you want?
[00:30:16.516 --> 00:30:17.277]  When do you want it?
[00:30:17.657 --> 00:30:19.259]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:19.539 --> 00:30:20.360]  When will you need it?
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.682]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:22.822 --> 00:30:23.923]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.143 --> 00:30:25.485]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:25.685 --> 00:30:30.750]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:34.133]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:38.017]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:39.317]  How much will you need?
[00:30:39.577 --> 00:30:40.177]  We don't know.
[00:30:40.478 --> 00:30:41.378]  How much do you want?
[00:30:41.578 --> 00:30:42.318]  All you can get.
[00:30:42.498 --> 00:30:43.358]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:43.598 --> 00:30:46.359]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:46.639 --> 00:30:48.400]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.340]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:03.892 --> 00:31:04.813]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.153 --> 00:31:08.875]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.095 --> 00:31:11.297]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.317 --> 00:31:16.380]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:23.466]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:23.846 --> 00:31:29.411]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:29.852 --> 00:31:33.515]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.015 --> 00:31:38.057]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.277 --> 00:31:43.840]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.281]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:49.202]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:49.762 --> 00:31:50.282]  It's here.
[00:31:50.883 --> 00:31:57.706]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:59.116 --> 00:32:02.758]  The mighty Roman soldier was given a daily ration of fermented fish oil.
[00:32:03.118 --> 00:32:07.701]  The stoic Scandinavian Viking had a drum of fermenting cod livers outside the door of his home.
[00:32:08.121 --> 00:32:11.062]  And Grandma always had cod liver oil in the cupboard.
[00:32:11.363 --> 00:32:15.845]  Today, Green Pasture Products, a family-owned business, provides high-quality nutrient-dense
[00:32:16.105 --> 00:32:16.586]  It's a good idea.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:39.306]  Green Pasture's products are clean, independently tested for impurities, made in the USA, and come in capsules or liquids.

[00:33:02.591 --> 00:33:04.574]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:33:04.594 --> 00:33:09.000]  Here they build the big guns.
[00:33:11.363 --> 00:33:13.786]  Here they build the death planes.
[00:33:15.689 --> 00:33:17.612]  Here they build all the bombs.
[00:33:21.611 --> 00:33:22.732]  We are back.
[00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:23.572]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.612 --> 00:33:25.493]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.513 --> 00:33:27.833]  We are joined by Mark Dice.
[00:33:27.893 --> 00:33:34.435]  Coming up in this segment, we are going to play a call to action and a little sneak peek of Invisible Empire, a new one.
[00:33:34.455 --> 00:33:35.075]  You haven't seen this one.
[00:33:35.095 --> 00:33:36.016]  We put it up on the website.
[00:33:36.036 --> 00:33:38.976]  All these things are over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:42.048 --> 00:33:43.889]  And I want to talk about this call to action.
[00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:56.574]  Because without you guys out there, without the listeners, without the viewers, without people burning these discs and getting them out to their friends, their family members, and complete strangers, yes I said complete strangers, we don't have an impact.
[00:33:56.594 --> 00:33:58.415]  That's why Loose Change was so huge.
[00:33:58.455 --> 00:34:06.499]  Because people saw a resonance in a message, copied the discs, handed them out in masses, really got the word out.
[00:34:06.539 --> 00:34:07.399]  And we need that again.
[00:34:07.959 --> 00:34:09.080]  I'm not trying to brag here.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:21.165]  But back in 2002, when I first woke up to this stuff, and there wasn't a PrisonPlanet.tv where I could just download all of Alex Jones' films, I was actually making my own discs.
[00:34:21.185 --> 00:34:23.066]  This was before DVD-Rs were out there.
[00:34:23.166 --> 00:34:26.907]  I was burning CD-Rs from FileShare.
[00:34:27.168 --> 00:34:32.570]  I was using Morpheus and Kazaa, all the predecessors to LimeWire, basically.
[00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:33.470]  Newtella.
[00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:39.952]  I was on all these little networks and I was getting the Alex Jones films and I was getting raw video from 9-11 and I was creating folders.
[00:34:39.972 --> 00:34:41.332]  This is before I was a filmmaker.
[00:34:41.753 --> 00:34:41.332]  2002!
[00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:49.795]  And I was burning CD after CD of things like Masters of Terror, Matrix of Evil in 2004 when that came out.
[00:34:49.815 --> 00:34:51.275]  That might have even been 2003.
[00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:53.756]  And getting the word out saying, hey, check this out.
[00:34:54.076 --> 00:35:02.218]  Now, a lot of people would just throw the disc away, but some people would watch one or two of the things and then they'd watch the rest and say, wow, this is some pretty interesting stuff, but is it all true?
[00:35:02.618 --> 00:35:15.922]  And now I can put together a package, a two hour and 12 minute movie that if you have no idea what global governance is, what a one world order might look like, you can have that information in a couple of hours.
[00:35:16.282 --> 00:35:18.243]  And with you, the listeners out there handing them out,
[00:35:19.372 --> 00:35:21.633]  It can have just such an impact.
[00:35:21.693 --> 00:35:27.114]  Mark, you yourself went through colleges and raided classrooms handing out loose change.
[00:35:27.654 --> 00:35:41.377]  Yeah, and even before that, I was downloading films off of Bear Share, Alex Jones' films too, and just saving them as Windows media files, and I was giving them out to people and friends and former teachers of mine.
[00:35:42.495 --> 00:36:00.582]  Yeah, I just got so angry and I realized that this information is so powerful and so important and it needed to pierce the mainstream and that's what I've tried to do with calling into these mainstream shows, weaseling my way into the gossip columns, the celebrity gossip columns.
[00:36:01.218 --> 00:36:07.563]  Criticizing celebrities in a relevant way and then pointing people down the path so they can find the bigger picture.
[00:36:07.703 --> 00:36:11.445]  And we need to continue that because people now are looking for answers.
[00:36:11.485 --> 00:36:13.947]  Like I said before, a lot of people didn't care about the war.
[00:36:14.007 --> 00:36:15.308]  They didn't think it affected them.
[00:36:15.608 --> 00:36:17.289]  People weren't involved in politics.
[00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:18.230]  They just didn't care.
[00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:24.535]  But now that their pocketbook is hurt, now that they're scared that they're going to lose their job, maybe they've taken a pay cut.
[00:36:24.575 --> 00:36:27.617]  Maybe they've had their cut back from full-time to part-time.
[00:36:27.997 --> 00:36:29.298]  Maybe they've lost their 401k match.
[00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:33.566]  They have friends and families that could be losing their homes.
[00:36:34.388 --> 00:36:35.671]  People now are looking for answers.
[00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:38.157]  So this is the perfect time to give them those answers.
[00:36:39.281 --> 00:36:48.610]  Absolutely, and saying that, we are now going to play this call to action by Alex Jones for my new film, Invisible Empire, A New World, Order Defined.
[00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.873]  It comes out April 15th, probably going to ship a little bit early.
[00:36:51.933 --> 00:36:52.814]  It's looking good, folks.
[00:36:52.834 --> 00:36:58.960]  We might have those DVDs in on Monday or Tuesday, so who knows, you might even get them on the 14th before tax day.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.602]  It's Invisible Empire, A New World, Order Defined.
[00:37:01.662 --> 00:37:02.503]  Pre-order it today.
[00:37:02.523 --> 00:37:03.244]  Here we go.
[00:37:04.403 --> 00:37:06.586]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:37:06.606 --> 00:37:08.889]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:37:08.989 --> 00:37:11.692]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:37:12.213 --> 00:37:16.998]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:21.524]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:37:21.824 --> 00:37:24.166]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:26.709]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:37:26.729 --> 00:37:29.631]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:37:29.972 --> 00:37:37.579]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:37:37.904 --> 00:37:43.186]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:37:43.286 --> 00:37:45.567]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:37:45.827 --> 00:37:49.588]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:37:49.608 --> 00:37:50.768]  And I got news for you.
[00:37:50.908 --> 00:37:51.649]  You're everyone else.
[00:37:52.249 --> 00:37:53.169]  Invisible Empire.

[00:38:01.933 --> 00:38:14.301]  If you look at the membership lists of the Bohemian Grove and the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, a lot of the key level people are overlapping and are involved in numerous groups.
[00:38:14.841 --> 00:38:17.484]  Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:38:17.504 --> 00:38:21.469]  18 months in the making here in our studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:38:21.789 --> 00:38:29.338]  We set out with Jason Bermas and our team to make a film designed to educate the general public about the history of the New World Order.
[00:38:29.878 --> 00:38:37.524]  I know that tens of millions of you worldwide are aware of global government, aware of the New World Order, aware of the eugenicists, and you understand their game plan.
[00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:40.046]  But the general public is not aware.
[00:38:40.526 --> 00:38:42.128]  They know something is wrong in the world.
[00:38:42.448 --> 00:38:43.328]  They're ready to listen.
[00:38:43.449 --> 00:38:45.170]  There is an awakening happening.
[00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.151]  And this film will accelerate that awakening.
[00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:52.772]  The Pentagon has said that 90% of the war is information.
[00:38:53.212 --> 00:38:54.152]  We understand that.
[00:38:54.473 --> 00:38:55.293]  We have the truth.
[00:38:55.693 --> 00:38:56.973]  The globalists have the lies.
[00:38:57.493 --> 00:39:03.015]  We go past the puppets directly to the true power structure of this planet.
[00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:13.558]  What makes them tick, what their goals are, how they control societies, how they use round table groups, front groups to control government, how they ship in narcotics.
[00:39:13.798 --> 00:39:21.901]  We've had a criminal corporate takeover of the United States and every other major industrialized country on the planet.
[00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:31.044]  The globalists in their own words calling for a planetary tyranny, how they control governments through continuity of government, through emergency dictatorship.
[00:39:32.148 --> 00:39:36.151]  I want to thank all of our supporters who over the years have made everything we do here possible.
[00:39:36.712 --> 00:39:40.876]  We have had a giant effect globally and much of that credit goes to you out there.
[00:39:40.896 --> 00:39:45.219]  So I want to thank my supporters in advance who are going to get this film and get it out to everyone.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:52.466]  The power to bring down the New World Order is in your hands and a heat weapon in this fight is Invisible Empire.
[00:39:53.186 --> 00:40:09.491]  Invisible Empire is perfect, not just to make copies on DVD and give to your friends and family, but to have viewing parties and screenings, to make this an event in your business, your household, your church, so that people understand exactly what's happening in our world.
[00:40:09.931 --> 00:40:15.912]  It is up to us who understand what's happening with the New World Order to get out there and to warn everyone we know.
[00:40:16.272 --> 00:40:17.613]  The ball is in your court.
[00:40:18.633 --> 00:40:26.241]  If the population is conscious of how the globalists are controlling society and what their endgame is, we can bring them down.
[00:40:27.042 --> 00:40:31.667]  You can go to InfoWars.com and purchase Invisible Empire today, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:41:07.944 --> 00:41:09.545]  The people are ready to hear the truth.
[00:41:09.565 --> 00:41:11.205]  They're ready to be fully awakened.
[00:41:11.225 --> 00:41:12.086]  They're ready to learn
[00:41:12.526 --> 00:41:13.766]  Who their enemy is.
[00:41:14.187 --> 00:41:17.828]  An invisible empire, a new order to find, does just that.
[00:41:18.128 --> 00:41:23.169]  It's available on DVD at infowars.com or again, go to prisonplanet.tv and sign up.

[00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.611]  It's coming out April 15th.
[00:41:27.691 --> 00:41:31.412]  You can also call toll free to order the DVD of this film.
[00:41:31.432 --> 00:41:31.472]  888-253-3139.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.143]  And Mark, I believe in this country.
[00:41:43.284 --> 00:41:55.440]  I believe in humanity in general and I know that there are a lot of well-meaning ignorant people out there that believe in climate change that don't understand that it's really about not only a
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:03.043]  Global government, folks, but about population control, about population reduction, about getting into every facet of your life.
[00:42:03.083 --> 00:42:05.384]  And this film exposes that amongst other things.
[00:42:05.645 --> 00:42:10.127]  A lot of people are just misguided of what their modes of control are.
[00:42:10.187 --> 00:42:13.788]  If they can't get you with the war, they're going to try to get you with the environment.
[00:42:14.088 --> 00:42:16.489]  That's what this false left-right paradigm is.
[00:42:16.649 --> 00:42:19.751]  And that's why it's so crucial to break that paradigm, Mark.
[00:42:20.632 --> 00:42:28.936]  Yes, and I myself, it's embarrassing for me to admit this, but at the onset of the war in Iraq, I still was not awakened to 9-11.
[00:42:28.956 --> 00:42:32.718]  I was still not awakened to the false-light terrorism.
[00:42:32.778 --> 00:42:34.579]  I was just a typical college kid.
[00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:42.643]  And I remember on my college campus, there were some people protesting the onset of the war, right before Operation Shock and Awe.
[00:42:42.663 --> 00:42:46.325]  And they had a microphone, and people could get up there and say their piece about why we should do this.
[00:42:46.385 --> 00:42:49.046]  And I ran up there, and I grabbed the microphone, and I said,
[00:42:49.506 --> 00:42:56.148]  You know, you people don't know what's going on after you spend most of your time watching MTV and reading Us Weekly.
[00:42:56.168 --> 00:43:00.050]  So you need to just trust our leaders, and they know.
[00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.631]  They have more information and more knowledge than you do.
[00:43:02.731 --> 00:43:05.372]  So if they want to go to war, I'm sure that there's a good reason.
[00:43:06.352 --> 00:43:07.692]  And there was a good reason.
[00:43:07.732 --> 00:43:10.313]  It was just not the reason that I had thought at that time.
[00:43:10.513 --> 00:43:13.014]  And I had well-meaning intentions.
[00:43:13.374 --> 00:43:15.175]  I was using my
[00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:22.673]  Extreme, extroverted self to go up there and do what I thought needed to be done, you know, to put these people down.
[00:43:23.313 --> 00:43:29.676]  And I'm very embarrassed about that now, because now that I realize the bigger picture, I see the error of my ways.
[00:43:29.756 --> 00:43:44.703]  And so I'm sure there's a lot of other people out there that are like me, like you, that are really passionate and want to do good, and think that Sean Hannity's a great American, and we need to help wake those people up and get them on our side.
[00:43:45.476 --> 00:43:49.060]  And it might be a slow process, but I think, look at how far we've come now.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.424]  I mean, I was downloading films off of Bear Share and streaming them.
[00:43:52.444 --> 00:43:56.408]  This is before YouTube, and it's so much easier now.
[00:43:56.548 --> 00:44:01.914]  We can grab somebody's attention so much faster than we did even just four years ago.
[00:44:02.867 --> 00:44:04.648]  And that's why they're going after the internet.
[00:44:04.688 --> 00:44:08.370]  They do realize that the internet does pose a great threat to them.
[00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:28.899]  Not just Wikileaks, not just Kryptome, but really Google Video was shut down because of the success of Loose Change Final Cut and then it started happening with Terror Storm and Endgame and even films like Zeitgeist got too big for their britches and they had to literally shut that down and put you in this new YouTube paradigm with the two companies
[00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:32.101]  You can't even upload anything to Google Video.
[00:44:32.141 --> 00:44:34.423]  Folks, I uploaded my last movie to Google Video.
[00:44:34.483 --> 00:44:35.844]  I couldn't get any stats on it.
[00:44:36.125 --> 00:44:39.367]  I was number two in the world within 24 hours of the release.
[00:44:39.587 --> 00:44:48.034]  I was number one in the world within 48 hours of release, and then I just disappeared from the page for an entire week, Mark, where I couldn't even find myself in the top 1,000.
[00:44:48.114 --> 00:44:54.779]  No, and you know, the Big Brother grid I see is a part of the film, and it's incredible.
[00:44:54.819 --> 00:44:55.440]  People think that
[00:44:56.001 --> 00:44:56.421]  I think so.
[00:45:14.443 --> 00:45:23.305]  may use terminology from George Orwell's 1984 novel, such as Memory Hole, Big Brother, Orwellian, Thought Police.
[00:45:23.485 --> 00:45:28.747]  All of these terms were actually coined by George Orwell in his novel that was published in 1949.
[00:45:28.867 --> 00:45:37.909]  And it's so crazy because he so accurately predicted, it's almost prophetic, what his book has done.
[00:45:37.949 --> 00:45:42.010]  I mean, here's a description of him talking about telescreen
[00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:50.594]  A lot of people may be familiar with this, other audience members may or may not, which are the screens that he wrote about that watched and listened everybody into society.
[00:45:50.614 --> 00:45:52.675]  And this is what he wrote in 1949.
[00:45:53.295 --> 00:45:56.557]  Quote, the telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.
[00:45:56.657 --> 00:46:00.758]  Any sound that went and made above the level of a low whisper would be picked up by it.
[00:46:01.138 --> 00:46:07.701]  Moreover, so as long as he remained within the field of vision of the metal plaque, he could be seen as well as heard.
[00:46:08.361 --> 00:46:10.162]  He had to live, did live,
[00:46:10.598 --> 00:46:10.718]  I'm
[00:46:29.013 --> 00:46:32.996]  And let's stop right there.
[00:46:33.016 --> 00:46:34.557]  Let's talk about that right there.
[00:46:34.778 --> 00:46:53.251]  In the United Kingdom, the so-called other great nation in the westernized world, in Europe, they are putting CCTV cameras, they already have in 2,000 plus homes, and that was over a year ago, and they said within the next 24 months they were going to try to make it 20,000 homes.
[00:46:53.271 --> 00:46:56.433]  And of course they always pick the dregs of society.
[00:46:56.633 --> 00:46:59.955]  I don't care how bad it is, we shouldn't have CCTV cameras that are manned 24-7 in our homes.
[00:46:59.975 --> 00:47:01.436]  It wouldn't matter if they weren't manned.
[00:47:14.963 --> 00:47:20.267]  But they realize they don't have enough infrastructure, enough personnel to have them watch those cameras.
[00:47:20.287 --> 00:47:25.531]  So what we also cover in the movie is the fact that you can now watch from your computer.
[00:47:25.571 --> 00:47:27.533]  You don't have to be a law enforcement officer.
[00:47:27.793 --> 00:47:36.120]  No, you can be just a random person who gets cash prizes for turning in criminals from watching random CCTV cameras, Mark.
[00:47:37.222 --> 00:47:46.046]  And these CCTV cameras, as of last year in London, I don't know how many, but they've implemented a program called ISIS.
[00:47:46.746 --> 00:47:49.967]  It stands for Integrated Sensor Information System.
[00:47:49.987 --> 00:47:54.989]  Now ISIS is the Egyptian goddess and mother of the sun god Horus.
[00:47:55.669 --> 00:47:57.650]  And these are pre-crime cameras.
[00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:59.791]  They have created a software system
[00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:13.524]  That looks at groups of people and allegedly can determine whether they're getting hostile or whether they're participating in suspicious behavior.
[00:48:13.944 --> 00:48:25.947]  And one of the officials said, quote, when a crime looks like it's going to occur, the system will verbally warn the perpetrator and, if necessary, alert the nearest police officer.
[00:48:27.088 --> 00:48:31.032]  And this is, this is what's happening, and this is only, this is last year!
[00:48:31.052 --> 00:48:35.156]  And just imagine what's going to happen in the next few years when these systems come on.
[00:48:35.216 --> 00:48:44.805]  Holland has a system that can record and listen to conversations from up to 100 yards away using an echelon type of keyword system.
[00:48:45.225 --> 00:48:52.292]  So if somebody's on the streets and they're talking about a particular issue, they're talking about the New World Order and they haven't mentioned several keywords,
[00:48:52.930 --> 00:49:06.663]  If this system can't detect it now, if the next generation system will, just imagine being hanging out on the street with your friends and just talking about a political issue, and several keywords come up in the conversation.
[00:49:06.823 --> 00:49:14.890]  And this system can detect that, and all of a sudden it's going to start looking at you closer, it's going to take your picture, put you into a database.
[00:49:15.591 --> 00:49:19.274]  This is the New World Order, and this is right around the corner.
[00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:27.553]  It's not only around the corner, it's here, and I want to talk about how they talk to you, how they talk to the populace, the general public out there.
[00:49:27.834 --> 00:49:31.235]  They say cash prizes as if it's a game show.
[00:49:31.255 --> 00:49:42.720]  They want you to associate those endorphins with that game show, that winning mentality, and of course money makes us feel good, so it's a cash prize when you turn in your neighbor, but it's not really your neighbor.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:49.123]  They're on the other side of town, or they're in a different county, or they're, you know, 200 miles away, but what they want to create and
[00:49:49.603 --> 00:50:01.066]  Super create because Hitler created this type of a society where Stasi forces tattletale on one another and you don't know who the government informant is because you all become the government informants.
[00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:10.948]  Your 12 year old is going to be sitting on these computers instead of an allowance he's going to be like, oh I can make 20 or 30 or maybe 200 or 300 dollars if I man the cameras for a few days.
[00:50:11.288 --> 00:50:12.408]  It's insane to me, Mark.
[00:50:13.422 --> 00:50:20.927]  There was a presentation, you can probably find this on the internet, by a man named Jesse Schell, who used to work as a creative director for Disney.
[00:50:21.847 --> 00:50:30.393]  And this was at the 2010, they call it the DICE Summit, it's the Design, Initiative, Communication, Entertain Summit.
[00:50:30.413 --> 00:50:33.915]  It's the Summit of Video Game Executives, and he's talking about the future of
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.161]  Video game.
[00:50:35.441 --> 00:50:42.447]  Hold right there because we also go into the future of video gaming and how they want to microchip you in the future with these systems.
[00:50:42.547 --> 00:50:43.467]  I'm not making it up.
[00:50:43.708 --> 00:50:47.751]  That's a step beyond Project Natal which is coming out of the Alex Jones Show back after this.
[00:50:48.031 --> 00:50:49.632]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:51:00.055 --> 00:51:00.396]  Fact.
[00:51:00.636 --> 00:51:01.958]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:51:01.978 --> 00:51:03.780]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:04.441]  Fact.
[00:51:04.621 --> 00:51:07.986]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:51:08.326 --> 00:51:08.647]  Fact.
[00:51:08.927 --> 00:51:14.254]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:51:14.454 --> 00:51:14.735]  Fact.
[00:51:15.055 --> 00:51:18.937]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:51:19.257 --> 00:51:19.597]  Fact!
[00:51:19.837 --> 00:51:23.598]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.
[00:51:23.818 --> 00:51:31.521]  Protect your liver by visiting ResearchedHerbs.com and learning more about the world's number one selling all-natural liver support formula, LIV52.
[00:51:31.661 --> 00:51:42.746]  It is the only herbal liver supplement that is backed by over 190 published clinical trials and endorsed by a quarter of a million healthcare professionals in 76 countries worldwide.
[00:51:43.006 --> 00:51:43.746]  Don't wait to protect
[00:51:43.746 --> 00:51:44.086]  Thank you.
[00:51:59.725 --> 00:52:02.007]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.027 --> 00:52:04.288]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.308 --> 00:52:07.150]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:12.393]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.753 --> 00:52:16.936]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.256 --> 00:52:19.579]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:22.142]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.482 --> 00:52:25.065]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.405 --> 00:52:32.994]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.334 --> 00:52:38.619]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.719 --> 00:52:41.001]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.041 --> 00:52:45.004]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.264 --> 00:52:46.165]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.345 --> 00:52:47.666]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.686 --> 00:52:48.787]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:58.908 --> 00:53:02.070]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:04.291]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:05.151]  Don't!
[00:53:05.611 --> 00:53:08.633]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[00:53:16.136 --> 00:53:17.817]  's number one debt secret.

[00:53:32.707 --> 00:53:33.688]  Herb K. was right.
[00:53:33.888 --> 00:53:36.951]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:38.152]  What have you got to lose?
[00:53:38.532 --> 00:53:41.514]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:53:41.814 --> 00:53:42.535]  Get Herb K.'
[00:53:42.495 --> 00:53:45.397]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.

[00:53:47.699 --> 00:53:48.260]  That's 800-822-1291 800-822-1291
[00:54:09.005 --> 00:54:11.287]  Final segment with Mark Dice of MarkDice.com.
[00:54:11.727 --> 00:54:16.411]  He's featured in my newest documentary, Invisible Empire, A New World Order to Find.
[00:54:16.431 --> 00:54:17.292]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:17.352 --> 00:54:19.474]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:54:19.574 --> 00:54:23.077]  And finish up, Mark, you were talking about the future of video gaming.
[00:54:23.878 --> 00:54:28.582]  This is a big shot that used to work for Disney and now has its own video game company.
[00:54:28.622 --> 00:54:32.926]  And at this technology summit, he was talking about the future of video games.
[00:54:34.053 --> 00:54:42.978]  And he was basically saying, he says, quote, you have no idea what books or what books your grandparents read or where they went on a daily basis.
[00:54:43.038 --> 00:54:53.764]  But these censors, he was talking about censors that are going to be everywhere, that are going to be on us and all around us everywhere, I'm quoting him here, to be tracking and watching what we're doing forever.
[00:54:54.245 --> 00:54:57.547]  And he says our grandchildren will know every book we've read.
[00:54:57.567 --> 00:55:01.089]  And then he goes on to say that they'll know what we did on a daily basis.
[00:55:01.149 --> 00:55:03.330]  And he concluded his speech by saying that
[00:55:04.048 --> 00:55:17.555]  Since this computer system is going to know everything that we do, everything we look at, everything we buy, everything we eat, the books, movies, music that we use, he says that maybe we'll actually become better people.
[00:55:18.316 --> 00:55:22.118]  Because we're going to be concerned with people judging us.
[00:55:22.945 --> 00:55:23.525]  Oh, yes.
[00:55:23.646 --> 00:55:28.868]  Big Brother needs to judge us in order for humanity to evolve, Mark.
[00:55:29.268 --> 00:55:30.269]  That's the big sell.
[00:55:30.329 --> 00:55:31.529]  No, it's for our own good.
[00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.111]  We're not evolved enough right now.
[00:55:34.191 --> 00:55:37.152]  We need to be watched so we make better moral decisions.
[00:55:37.312 --> 00:55:40.894]  Why don't we just make better moral decisions on our own?
[00:55:41.334 --> 00:55:43.936]  Why don't we just find a moral compass again?
[00:55:44.036 --> 00:55:45.096]  Love thy neighbor.
[00:55:45.196 --> 00:55:46.317]  Work with one another.
[00:55:46.557 --> 00:55:49.759]  Work against the tyrants that keep taking more and more.
[00:55:50.119 --> 00:55:51.840]  And in their own documents, they admit it.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:52.500]  I don't know if you've seen
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.181]  Capitalism a love story yet?
[00:55:54.481 --> 00:55:59.683]  Of course Michael Moore misidentifies the problem as capitalism when it's really globalism.
[00:56:00.143 --> 00:56:08.767]  But Citigroup has these internal documents where they admit we are no longer in a democracy or a constitutional republic or anything of that nature.
[00:56:08.827 --> 00:56:19.792]  They admit we are in a plutonomy in which the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer and the great divide becomes so great the only thing they're worried about is
[00:56:22.015 --> 00:56:34.871]  You know, the futurist Ray Kurzweil has written some pretty incredible books about the future of technology, about the age of intelligent machines, the age of spiritual machines.
[00:56:36.199 --> 00:56:57.462]  He actually admits in one of his books that in the future, I think he predicts by about 2029, that there's going to be a tremendous gap between, because of technology, between those who are just completely politically disconnected, socially disconnected, and he kind of dances around the fact that there is going to be a technocracy elite.
[00:56:57.922 --> 00:57:10.372]  That have access to all of this technology, that use the technology, and then just the slaves that really have nothing and are kind of just left, you know, running on the treadmill slaving to the man, as I like to say.
[00:57:11.476 --> 00:57:13.897]  But I even think that's a soft term, a technocracy.
[00:57:13.917 --> 00:57:16.718]  That implies as though the people have some say in this.
[00:57:16.958 --> 00:57:25.562]  No, we live in a technopoly now run by the military-industrial complex that really started to gain momentum in the 30s, 40s, 50s.
[00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:30.344]  And by the 60s, Eisenhower had identified it and warned us against it.
[00:57:30.404 --> 00:57:32.965]  Again, that is featured in my new film, Invisible Empire.
[00:57:33.005 --> 00:57:33.986]  We really go over
[00:57:34.286 --> 00:57:51.432]  The entire history, in a nutshell, of the term New World Order, of its modes of control, of those who wanted a one world government, a one world society, where the state is God, where a collectivist mindset is put upon us and we no longer have our humanity or individuality, Mark.
[00:57:52.653 --> 00:57:54.033]  No, that's part of the plan.
[00:57:54.053 --> 00:57:55.874]  And it gets so creepy.
[00:57:55.934 --> 00:58:00.976]  I mean, some people can't even grasp what it is that's happening and what's coming around the corner.
[00:58:01.296 --> 00:58:03.417]  I have dug up actual patents.
[00:58:04.182 --> 00:58:08.985]  Of subliminal messaging devices that have been patented for 20 years.
[00:58:09.626 --> 00:58:24.595]  Back in the late 70s, the Wall Street Journal and Time Magazine did articles on shopping malls that were implanting subliminal messages in the music system to try to get people to not shoplift, and apparently they had success.
[00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:31.540]  There's one patent here that I have that was filed in 1989 that can submit subliminal messages
[00:58:33.261 --> 00:58:36.543]  Mark, people don't understand the amount of control they're really under.
[00:58:36.603 --> 00:58:37.424]  I thank you for joining us.
[00:58:37.484 --> 00:58:39.005]  It's the Alex Jones Show, back after this.
[00:58:49.266 --> 00:58:50.526]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:50.566 --> 00:58:55.909]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:56.149 --> 00:59:00.771]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:06.253]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:06.753 --> 00:59:08.574]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[00:59:08.834 --> 00:59:09.334]  We're good to go!
[00:59:38.482 --> 00:59:40.584]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:41.084 --> 00:59:45.629]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:45.929 --> 00:59:48.391]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:52.335 --> 00:59:54.257]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.718 --> 00:59:57.480]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:03.982 --> 01:00:04.623]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.304 --> 01:00:06.345]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.066 --> 01:00:08.227]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.828 --> 01:00:09.649]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:12.313]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:15.697]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.157 --> 01:00:20.222]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.278 --> 01:00:23.560]  A power-packed program today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.923]  I am Jason Vermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.963 --> 01:00:27.064]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:27.084 --> 01:00:35.111]  We just had Mark Dice, the author of New World Order Facts and Fiction on, and now we are joined by Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[01:00:36.672 --> 01:00:38.134]  And I want to talk about the economy.
[01:00:38.194 --> 01:00:49.802]  I want to talk about Bernanke openly saying they're not only going to raise taxes, but take away quote-unquote entitlement programs that people have bought into for years and years and years.
[01:00:49.822 --> 01:00:51.884]  We're talking decades upon decades.
[01:00:51.904 --> 01:00:55.206]  And now they're saying no, you're not going to get your Social Security.
[01:00:55.306 --> 01:00:57.988]  No, you're not going to get your Medicare.
[01:00:58.008 --> 01:00:58.929]  And they're going to take it away.
[01:00:59.409 --> 01:01:01.250]  Well, I think they're planning another war.
[01:01:29.312 --> 01:01:35.978]  And so that's going to cost us another, it'll probably be a world war, so it'll probably cost us about $5 trillion.
[01:01:36.758 --> 01:01:40.501]  And so they don't want to talk about that, but they've got that in the cards.
[01:01:41.182 --> 01:01:44.685]  And that's how, you know, I project ahead what they're going to do.
[01:01:44.745 --> 01:01:51.650]  And that's how I was able to make the call on 9-11 and in Iraq and Afghanistan, because these are diversions.
[01:01:52.271 --> 01:01:58.276]  So in the context of budget, what he said was meaningless, other than the fact
[01:01:58.717 --> 01:02:09.885]  That we're going to take you from a recession and then into a depression and then we're going to bring you deeply into poverty.
[01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:11.746]  That's really what it's all about.
[01:02:12.026 --> 01:02:15.889]  And they were even talking about a VAT, a value-added tax.
[01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:25.336]  And because it's so complex, you're talking about it being a minimum of 10% tax because that 10% will go to
[01:02:27.663 --> 01:02:33.825]  The monitoring and operation of the tax itself.
[01:02:34.325 --> 01:02:40.847]  So that's why VATs usually run somewhere between 17 and 21 percent.
[01:02:41.527 --> 01:02:43.828]  And we'll say the average is 18 and a half.
[01:02:44.948 --> 01:02:54.411]  And so about 8 and a half percent goes in to defray other costs and the remainder goes for administration, so to speak.
[01:02:55.057 --> 01:02:59.439]  And so the talkie, Al Fokker, was the one that brought that up again the other day.
[01:02:59.479 --> 01:03:00.779]  Others have brought it up as well.
[01:03:01.159 --> 01:03:02.280]  But there's no question.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:10.042]  But to fully answer this question, I'll reiterate something I've said on Alex's show before, several times.
[01:03:10.622 --> 01:03:23.987]  And that is, I'm expecting next year that these countries that have these sovereign debt problems, and there's 19 of them, and by mid-next year there'll be more of them,
[01:03:24.611 --> 01:03:39.581]  And they're going to have a meeting and they're going to devalue worldwide currencies simultaneously and they are going to settle a debt default among nations.
[01:03:40.002 --> 01:03:49.268]  And this could be the crisis that they're looking for to bring in their world financial constitution as Gordon Brown mused in late February of this year.
[01:03:50.148 --> 01:03:50.709]  That's right.
[01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:53.651]  And I just got off a program
[01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:57.430]  Which, Alex is the only other American that's been on there.
[01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:08.574]  There's the international radio out of Athens, which is carried by BBC and Deutsche Welle and the French International Network.
[01:04:09.514 --> 01:04:13.335]  And, you know, Helen Scope has said to me, well, why are they doing this?
[01:04:14.175 --> 01:04:15.196]  Why is this happening?
[01:04:15.596 --> 01:04:17.156]  I said, ask your Prime Minister.
[01:04:17.196 --> 01:04:18.677]  He's a member of the Bilderberger Group.
[01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:25.394]  And it'll be interesting to see if that's edited out of the tape or not when it goes on the air.
[01:04:25.834 --> 01:04:27.215]  But the point is this.
[01:04:28.395 --> 01:04:31.657]  That's why Grease was used as a poster child.
[01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:34.951]  Well, let's come back to that on the other side.
[01:04:34.991 --> 01:04:39.774]  Then I also want you to break down what exactly is a value-added tax?
[01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.236]  Who's going to be paying it?
[01:04:41.496 --> 01:04:42.937]  How are they going to implement it?
[01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:46.500]  And how gradually will it be increased, just like every other tax we have?
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.681]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:47.701 --> 01:04:50.803]  We're streaming live over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:01.155 --> 01:05:04.796]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:05.116 --> 01:05:13.257]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:13.977 --> 01:05:18.018]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:18.618 --> 01:05:29.420]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:39.084]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:39.585 --> 01:05:44.647]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:52.170]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:55.252]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:02.460]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:06:03.321 --> 01:06:04.221]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:04.581 --> 01:06:08.142]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:08.462 --> 01:06:10.723]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:10.743 --> 01:06:16.184]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:16.604 --> 01:06:22.826]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:23.286 --> 01:06:28.830]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:32.913]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:33.434 --> 01:06:37.417]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:37.717 --> 01:06:43.281]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:43.661 --> 01:06:46.603]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:47.224 --> 01:06:48.665]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:49.626]  It's here.

[01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:54.993]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:09.331]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:12.272]  I am Jason Berman sitting and we're joined by Bob Chapman.
[01:08:12.872 --> 01:08:18.474]  And Bob, I want you to go over why Greece is the model for the global economic collapse.
[01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:27.017]  And then coming up at the 30 aftermark, I'm actually going to play Gordon Brown announcing the need for a global constitution.
[01:08:27.057 --> 01:08:32.939]  And this is a man who has called for a new world order literally dozens upon dozens of times.
[01:08:32.959 --> 01:08:34.640]  So Bob, why is Greece the model?
[01:08:36.574 --> 01:08:37.956]  Because they're very vulnerable.
[01:08:38.556 --> 01:08:42.800]  They should have never gone into the Eurozone in the first place, because they didn't qualify.
[01:08:43.021 --> 01:08:47.485]  Goldman Sachs come in and Mickey Mouse their books for them, and now they're paying for it.
[01:08:48.186 --> 01:08:50.968]  And they did the same thing for Italy as well.
[01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:56.634]  Italy should have never been accepted because they didn't qualify either under the Maastricht guidelines.
[01:08:57.415 --> 01:08:59.737]  And so, where they're headed with this,
[01:09:00.908 --> 01:09:07.534]  And the only reason I think that they brought this up instead of covering up any kind of a problem that they had previously.
[01:09:07.634 --> 01:09:12.398]  Because Papandreou is a Bilderberger, so he knows what's going on.
[01:09:13.118 --> 01:09:21.906]  And so what they did is they decided that we're going to have inflation between now and sometime next year.
[01:09:22.706 --> 01:09:27.430]  And what they're going to do is they're going to bring all these nations together.
[01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:29.172]  They're going to devalue and default.
[01:09:29.716 --> 01:09:34.060]  And then they're going to have a deflationary depression, and they're going to take them all down together.
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:41.026]  There's 19 countries that are virtually bankrupt, and they're going to take them all down together at the same time.
[01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.448]  And by that time, there'll probably be more of them.
[01:09:44.549 --> 01:09:46.791]  And so Greece was chosen because it was easy.
[01:09:48.174 --> 01:10:15.900]  Now, you're saying you're going to see a domino effect, or you're saying right at the same time, as soon as one of these large nations economically collapses, is it going to be like a week-long period, a month-long period, are we literally going to see an economic collapse happen before our eyes in days, and then them either magically have one of these global summits on the horizon, it'll happen just before that, or they'll create a new global summit in which they have to bring in this global constitution?
[01:10:17.858 --> 01:10:22.440]  Either or, but I don't think they're going to bring the Constitution in quickly.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:31.624]  They have to put the world into, well put them on their knees financially and economically.
[01:10:32.244 --> 01:10:41.488]  And then they will be, because they'll be wards of the state so to speak, because everything will be chaos financially and economically and we'll probably have another war going on at the same time.
[01:10:41.868 --> 01:10:45.750]  They'll say, oh gee, maybe six months down the line we have to have this.
[01:10:46.455 --> 01:11:14.311]  International World Constitution, and that's when they'll try to ram it in, but I think, you know, they're incrementalists, and what they'll do is they'll lead up, this one's got a problem, Latvia or Iceland or Poland, and you'll start reading about sovereign debt problems among 15 or 20 countries, including the United States, and all of a sudden, bingo, we've got to have that meeting, and then they'll have their meeting, and then we'll be perpetual
[01:11:15.453 --> 01:11:16.914]  Depression for a long time.
[01:11:18.135 --> 01:11:21.997]  Now you were talking about a value-added tax and how complex it was.
[01:11:22.037 --> 01:11:25.358]  Now how would this be thrust upon the people and who would be paying it first?
[01:11:27.019 --> 01:11:32.122]  Well, a value-added tax is paid at all stages of services or production.
[01:11:33.202 --> 01:11:35.063]  And so it's a multiple tax.
[01:11:35.884 --> 01:11:38.545]  It just isn't the 18.5% on average that I mentioned.
[01:11:40.382 --> 01:11:49.169]  Within that, which the people pay at the counter, so to speak, when they buy an iron or an ironing board or something like that.
[01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:52.892]  Before that, they tax at each stage.
[01:11:53.973 --> 01:12:05.382]  In other words, when the steel or whatever the implement is made out of reaches the gate of the manufacturer, it's taxed.
[01:12:05.883 --> 01:12:07.544]  And then once it's processed,
[01:12:09.506 --> 01:12:11.828]  And it's finished product, it's taxed.
[01:12:12.368 --> 01:12:15.751]  And then it goes to the middleman, and it's taxed.
[01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:20.554]  And then it goes from the middleman to the retail counter, and that's when you pay your 18.5%.
[01:12:20.594 --> 01:12:23.936]  So, it really may not be 18.5% to the entire economy, it may be 23.5% or more.
[01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:37.783]  And it may cause these production people to actually raise the prices, so the people at the counter will be paying even more than an 18.5% tax increase.
[01:12:37.823 --> 01:12:43.026]  They'll be paying perhaps another 10 or 20% because of the cost to the producers and manufacturers.
[01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:45.667]  Very perceptive.
[01:12:46.408 --> 01:12:47.828]  And that's what happened in Europe.
[01:12:48.789 --> 01:12:55.233]  And also, right after, they set new guidelines to
[01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:57.880]  I don't think so.
[01:13:10.538 --> 01:13:20.006]  In fact, at record highs today, it's $9 for a gallon of gas in, I believe it's in the United Kingdom, six pounds, if you will, which is $9.
[01:13:20.387 --> 01:13:22.489]  Here, $9 for a gallon of gas.
[01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:31.577]  I gripe when it's above three or it's at 450 or almost five when I go to New York sometimes, but they're paying $9 a gallon in gas, Bob.
[01:13:33.318 --> 01:13:37.502]  Well, a value-added tax at this stage of America's
[01:13:38.995 --> 01:13:43.479]  Um, problem development, we'll put it, is going to be disastrous.
[01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:47.321]  I mean, it'll be like financially imprisoning people.
[01:13:47.842 --> 01:13:55.207]  I mean, the whole setup in the United States will change and it will become even more fascistic or socialistic, whichever you want to call it.
[01:13:55.948 --> 01:14:01.332]  And the government will have more and more control over people by using a VAT.
[01:14:02.611 --> 01:14:05.753]  Yeah, but Bob, the New York Times is telling me everything is okay.
[01:14:05.773 --> 01:14:07.454]  This is the headline of the New York Times.
[01:14:07.514 --> 01:14:08.295]  It's a joke, folks.
[01:14:08.655 --> 01:14:09.576]  Why so glum?
[01:14:09.876 --> 01:14:11.537]  Numbers point to a recovery.
[01:14:11.817 --> 01:14:15.840]  The American economy appears to be in a cyclical recovery that is gaining strength.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.023]  Firms have begun to hire and consumer spending seems to be accelerating.
[01:14:21.363 --> 01:14:22.784]  Meanwhile, we have over 20% real
[01:14:23.985 --> 01:14:25.947]  That's why the New York Times is about to go out of business.
[01:14:25.967 --> 01:14:27.568]  I think that's a second tie to being lied to.
[01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:28.689]  It's as simple as that.
[01:14:51.201 --> 01:14:57.175]  Alternative radio, as well as the internet, is so popular, particularly among younger people.
[01:14:57.676 --> 01:14:58.258]  Who's younger?
[01:14:58.298 --> 01:14:58.799]  People under 45.
[01:15:00.718 --> 01:15:03.740]  Well, I think it's also the fact that they can read through the propaganda.
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:16.988]  New York Times may not go out of business, but they have to find a way to pose people against one another instead of directing them towards the bankers, towards the elitists, towards the people that are really bringing this in.
[01:15:17.028 --> 01:15:17.929]  Let me give you an example.
[01:15:18.249 --> 01:15:20.271]  This one's out of the Associated Press yesterday.
[01:15:20.531 --> 01:15:21.732]  Nearly half of U.S.
[01:15:21.792 --> 01:15:24.093]  households escape federal income tax.
[01:15:24.313 --> 01:15:26.755]  See, your neighbors aren't paying federal income tax.
[01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:28.136]  They're the enemy, Bob.
[01:15:28.176 --> 01:15:29.917]  They're the reason this country's going under.
[01:15:33.278 --> 01:15:35.379]  Let's start with the people who make lots of money.
[01:15:35.439 --> 01:15:37.380]  They don't pay any taxes.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.341]  Corporations pay very little.
[01:15:40.781 --> 01:15:43.602]  Explain to people how corporate welfare works.
[01:15:49.418 --> 01:15:50.658]  Well, again, explain that to people.
[01:15:50.918 --> 01:16:00.560]  The big corporations out there, they're the ones that really don't pay the taxes and then in turn take our tax money through corporate welfare to insure their programs.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.821]  They're government subsidized.
[01:16:03.661 --> 01:16:07.762]  And Bernanke's a good example with TARP and all of those other programs they had.
[01:16:08.222 --> 01:16:12.583]  They bailed out Wall Street banking, insurance companies, AIG, GE.
[01:16:13.799 --> 01:16:26.464]  GM, which we now own as taxpayers of the United States, and so they're doing exactly what they want to do, and that is not to pay taxes.
[01:16:26.845 --> 01:16:42.271]  And one of the facets that almost everybody forgets is when these companies, we'll take GE as an example, do business all over the world, they have subsidiaries, and they funnel the profits
[01:16:43.291 --> 01:16:49.813]  into offshore subsidiary corporations set up in the Cayman Islands and places like that.
[01:16:50.093 --> 01:16:53.314]  Now, you and I can't do that, but the corporations can.
[01:16:53.714 --> 01:17:05.418]  And the last time they gave them an act of Congress that said, you international corporations have promised to create jobs, so we're going to let you bring back money.
[01:17:07.118 --> 01:17:11.720]  And they put back $350 billion into the United States and only paid 5.25% tax
[01:17:13.618 --> 01:17:15.019]  It's almost five years ago now.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.621]  They created no jobs.
[01:17:17.141 --> 01:17:18.262]  Regular taxation is 33%.
[01:17:19.884 --> 01:17:35.579]  Right now, there is approximately, now let me get up the figures, about 1.3 trillion dollars sitting out there that they've never paid tax on, and they're going to pull the same thing again.
[01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:36.901]  And we
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:18:06.463]  Incrementally been driven down the value of the dollar has incrementally been driven down We've been moved towards a global currency an SDR unit the dollar is no longer the choice world reserve Currency and I want to get into that as well.
[01:18:06.503 --> 01:18:14.765]  They've dumped the dollar and gold seems to be up yet again today How can people ensure that they can keep some of the value that they've worked so hard for in their lives?
[01:18:15.945 --> 01:18:17.126]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:18:17.666 --> 01:18:19.106]  It's called minus resources and
[01:18:20.023 --> 01:18:21.604]  You buy gold and silver coins.
[01:18:21.644 --> 01:18:22.425]  That's what you do.
[01:18:22.925 --> 01:18:31.030]  And incidentally, I talked to Ted earlier, and he told me to offer their French franc for $249.68.
[01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:40.216]  And if you do that, you'll get a free one-year subscription to the International Forecaster, which is a dynamite deal.
[01:18:40.256 --> 01:18:41.837]  And he does pay for that, believe me.
[01:18:42.397 --> 01:18:43.658]  And that number to call is 800-686-8000.
[01:18:46.423 --> 01:18:46.644]  2237-800-686-2237.
[01:18:46.684 --> 01:18:53.137]  That is a super deal.
[01:18:53.378 --> 01:18:54.821]  But that's how you protect yourself.
[01:18:55.162 --> 01:18:57.446]  You buy gold and silver, and you put it away.
[01:18:58.706 --> 01:19:04.493]  Now Bob, on the other side of the next segment, I want to talk about you eluding us into another war.
[01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.075]  Are we going to be attacking Iran?
[01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:08.198]  If so, does that lead to a world war?
[01:19:08.618 --> 01:19:12.803]  What would World War III really look like in this time and age?
[01:19:12.823 --> 01:19:16.308]  I mean, would we have troops on the street here in the United States?
[01:19:16.368 --> 01:19:17.449]  Would we be fighting?
[01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.450]  We're good to go.
[01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:40.797]  I can see the wars that we have in the Middle East where we literally dominate these other nations for imperial power.
[01:19:41.038 --> 01:19:41.979]  But a world war?
[01:19:42.599 --> 01:19:43.841]  I don't know what that's going to look like.
[01:19:43.861 --> 01:19:44.862]  We'll be back after this.
[01:19:45.142 --> 01:19:46.064]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:46.084 --> 01:19:48.106]  I'm Jason Bermas with Bob Chapman.

[01:20:59.767 --> 01:21:02.488]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:21:02.728 --> 01:21:06.689]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:08.950]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:14.172]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:21:14.312 --> 01:21:16.073]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:21:16.133 --> 01:21:17.473]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:19.114]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:21:19.154 --> 01:21:22.215]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:21:22.515 --> 01:21:27.557]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:21:27.897 --> 01:21:37.022]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[01:23:50.587 --> 01:23:50.907]  MyPillow.
[01:23:50.987 --> 01:23:51.888]  For the rest of your life.
[01:24:07.611 --> 01:24:08.411]  We are back.
[01:24:08.472 --> 01:24:09.452]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:09.632 --> 01:24:10.853]  I am Jason Verma sitting in.
[01:24:10.893 --> 01:24:12.954]  We're joined by Bob Chapman.
[01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:18.237]  And Bob, you were alluding to the fact that we may be put into another world war.
[01:24:18.257 --> 01:24:19.798]  How do you think that will be started?
[01:24:19.818 --> 01:24:21.159]  Will it be started through Iran?
[01:24:21.199 --> 01:24:22.259]  And then what does it look like?
[01:24:22.299 --> 01:24:28.222]  I mean, Obama and Medvedev just signed this new treaty, this new arms treaty.
[01:24:28.283 --> 01:24:30.264]  So a lot of people are saying it doesn't look like we're really
[01:24:31.104 --> 01:24:44.066]  In any danger of a hot war with Russia, however, I do see a real separation between Russia and the United States, at least in the currency trade with groups like BRIC trying to challenge the United States' power.
[01:24:44.126 --> 01:24:46.767]  That's Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and China.
[01:24:46.807 --> 01:24:53.528]  And even Medvedev himself showing a sample coin of this elusive global currency that the globalists seem to want to bring in.
[01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:56.989]  So how do we get involved in a world war?
[01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:59.390]  What side will we be on?
[01:24:59.490 --> 01:25:01.370]  Who will be our allies?
[01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:02.191]  Who will be our enemies?
[01:25:04.151 --> 01:25:06.852]  Well, I think the Britnations will be our enemies.
[01:25:07.852 --> 01:25:12.234]  And the reason why is that they have treaties with Iran.
[01:25:13.054 --> 01:25:14.775]  And Iran's the one that's going to be attacked.
[01:25:15.915 --> 01:25:18.656]  And it'll engulf the entire Middle East for openness.
[01:25:18.816 --> 01:25:25.218]  I think the move by the President of the United States to have this non-nuclear treaty
[01:25:26.251 --> 01:25:28.957]  Uh, was just a paint in a different direction.
[01:25:29.839 --> 01:25:31.121]  I don't think it means anything.
[01:25:31.141 --> 01:25:32.725]  So it's all for show?
[01:25:32.745 --> 01:25:36.613]  They're talking about doing away with nuclear weapons, but I don't think they're going to do that.
[01:25:37.469 --> 01:25:38.089]  Well, obviously.
[01:25:38.129 --> 01:25:42.911]  I mean, they're saying that it wouldn't actually, it would be a 30% reduction, which is nothing.
[01:25:42.951 --> 01:25:44.512]  They could still destroy each other.
[01:25:44.792 --> 01:25:50.895]  But obviously, there's some kind of a geopolitical reason to do this, to put these people on stage together.
[01:25:50.915 --> 01:26:03.000]  But you do believe that if we do get involved in a world war, it probably will be sparked with some kind of a conflict in the Middle East, probably Iran, and then it will be the BRIC nations that we're fighting, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and China?
[01:26:04.281 --> 01:26:06.302]  Yeah, but it'll involve a lot more than that.
[01:26:07.054 --> 01:26:09.436]  And it'll probably go on for a number of years.
[01:26:10.297 --> 01:26:12.579]  This is a method of distraction.
[01:26:12.699 --> 01:26:23.149]  When you're more worried about your children getting killed in warfare, you take your eye off the ball, and the ball happens to be the problem, economically and financially.
[01:26:23.849 --> 01:26:32.457]  It also will allow, and I lived through the Second World War, so I'm very well aware of it, it'll allow a government
[01:26:33.098 --> 01:26:36.801]  To be able to control people more easily.
[01:26:37.682 --> 01:26:41.465]  Like if they say that you can't go out on the street between 10 p.m.
[01:26:41.505 --> 01:26:42.946]  and 6 a.m., well you can't.
[01:26:44.147 --> 01:26:46.148]  And so on and so forth.
[01:26:46.188 --> 01:26:56.136]  So you're saying that they'll probably, even if there isn't a hot warfare that takes place in the United States or one of the surrounding regions, they'll impose curfews and further extend martial law in this country?
[01:26:57.237 --> 01:26:58.198]  Could very well be.
[01:26:58.858 --> 01:27:02.081]  And they would use homeland security, local law enforcement,
[01:27:02.859 --> 01:27:19.567]  And perhaps this new Hitler-Junger type organization that our president wants to put into operation, starting with 6,000, and I'm sure before you'll know it, it'll be 600,000 of these little goons running around the country.
[01:27:21.294 --> 01:27:39.605]  Yeah, it really struck me very hard when I saw the promotion of social programs like City Year, and instead of what it's supposed to be about, helping the community, it's kids in military formation doing jumping jacks, talking about change in red, white, and black jackets.
[01:27:40.245 --> 01:27:49.131]  That looks a lot to me like Hitler Youth in those same color schemes, only a more advanced version of it 60 plus years later.
[01:27:50.846 --> 01:27:53.648]  And yelling Obama, Obama, Obama.
[01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:56.850]  It's so true.
[01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:59.392]  You're creating a cult, is what you're creating.
[01:27:59.972 --> 01:28:05.555]  And, you know, these young people, they don't know that they're getting brainwashed when they are.
[01:28:06.076 --> 01:28:08.137]  And they didn't in Germany, for that matter.
[01:28:08.757 --> 01:28:12.020]  And so that's, you know, the path it'll take.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.402]  And then you have this, well, why don't you join up with
[01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:18.587]  The Obama Youth or whatever it's called.
[01:28:19.148 --> 01:28:24.657]  And before you know it, you have a lot of people under social pressure joining.
[01:28:24.677 --> 01:28:29.605]  And then when they find out what, you know, they've gotten themselves into, it's too late.
[01:28:30.894 --> 01:28:38.220]  And as our economy erodes, the only type of programs and jobs that will be offered are from the state.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.442]  That's why they passed these acts like the GIVE Act.
[01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:43.625]  So that they, again, could expand government.
[01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:47.028]  Expand your dependence on government.
[01:28:47.468 --> 01:28:51.591]  Oh, give a year to City Year, we'll pay some of your bills, you'll be able to go to school.
[01:28:51.871 --> 01:28:53.792]  It always sounds like a positive thing.
[01:28:54.012 --> 01:28:56.974]  Oh, you'll get free health care, everybody will be covered.
[01:28:57.034 --> 01:29:02.437]  No, it's actually a new tax and you'll get less health care with literal death panels.
[01:29:02.477 --> 01:29:08.781]  And that was alluded to in the mainstream media with the cover of Newsweek saying, the case for killing Granny.
[01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:13.244]  These people are sometimes so out in the open, Bob, it shocks me to my very core.
[01:29:15.051 --> 01:29:15.851]  And they don't care.
[01:29:15.871 --> 01:29:18.553]  This has been going on for the last couple of years.
[01:29:19.173 --> 01:29:19.813]  The arrogance.
[01:29:20.234 --> 01:29:21.814]  We are the masters of the universe.
[01:29:21.854 --> 01:29:22.595]  We are the elitists.
[01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:25.856]  And we know better what is good for you than you do.
[01:29:25.936 --> 01:29:28.558]  And we're going to do it to you, whether you like it or not.
[01:29:28.998 --> 01:29:29.999]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:30.019 --> 01:29:30.999]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:29:31.019 --> 01:29:32.580]  We're going to come back with Bob Chappin.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:38.023]  We're also going to play this clip of Gordon Brown calling for a global constitution and much more.
[01:29:38.403 --> 01:29:40.144]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:49.972 --> 01:29:52.973]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.914 --> 01:29:56.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.576 --> 01:30:04.998]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:06.238 --> 01:30:11.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:17.783]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.903]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:22.943 --> 01:30:26.407]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:30:28.602 --> 01:30:32.464]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:30:33.184 --> 01:30:36.326]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:30:37.006 --> 01:30:37.867]  Others don't.
[01:30:38.247 --> 01:30:40.128]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:40.388 --> 01:30:41.909]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:44.750]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:51.314]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:51.694 --> 01:30:53.895]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:54.395 --> 01:30:56.436]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:30:56.756 --> 01:30:57.597]  Others don't.
[01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:02.293]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:02.713 --> 01:31:07.679]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.762]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:10.082 --> 01:31:14.907]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:15.088 --> 01:31:16.049]  How much do you want?
[01:31:16.269 --> 01:31:17.010]  When do you want it?
[01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:18.992]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:19.272 --> 01:31:20.093]  When will you need it?
[01:31:20.334 --> 01:31:22.396]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:22.556 --> 01:31:23.638]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:25.220]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:30.486]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:30.686 --> 01:31:33.810]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:37.754]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:38.074 --> 01:31:39.055]  How much will you need?
[01:31:39.315 --> 01:31:39.936]  We don't know.
[01:31:40.216 --> 01:31:41.117]  How much do you want?
[01:31:41.317 --> 01:31:42.038]  All you can get.
[01:31:42.058 --> 01:31:43.099]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:43.339 --> 01:31:46.102]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:46.382 --> 01:31:49.025]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.245 --> 01:31:50.006]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:59.062 --> 01:32:00.043]  What's your home worth?
[01:32:00.224 --> 01:32:02.146]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:32:02.326 --> 01:32:05.070]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[01:33:11.491 --> 01:33:12.291]  We are back.
[01:33:12.311 --> 01:33:13.372]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.472 --> 01:33:14.792]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[01:33:14.812 --> 01:33:16.112]  We're joined by Bob Chapman.
[01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:21.894]  And before we get to this Gordon Brown clip, where he calls for a global financial constitution.
[01:33:21.974 --> 01:33:24.894]  Gordon, New World Order, Brown, as I like to call him.
[01:33:24.914 --> 01:33:28.455]  I want to thank one of our great sponsors, FrontSight.com.
[01:33:28.475 --> 01:33:29.656]  That's FrontSight.com.
[01:33:30.076 --> 01:33:33.517]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[01:33:33.537 --> 01:33:38.118]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30
[01:33:39.418 --> 01:33:41.299]  All right, I want to get to this clip.
[01:33:41.559 --> 01:33:42.919]  This is Gordon Brown this February.
[01:34:00.066 --> 01:34:04.868]  A little, I think about two months ago now, calling for a global constitution.
[01:34:04.968 --> 01:34:10.649]  Nothing short of a global constitution to regulate all financial systems.
[01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:24.094]  And this coming on the heels of last year's announcement that the IMF would actually be absorbing the SEC and Federal Reserve as they came into a more cohesive unit under the United Nations and global governance.
[01:34:24.154 --> 01:34:24.634]  Let's hit it.
[01:34:25.506 --> 01:34:36.731]  Now, over the last decade, Policy Network has performed a momentous role in the development of progressive thinking, bringing us together as one global progressive family.
[01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:41.593]  And I think few organisations could have achieved more in such a short space of time.
[01:34:42.394 --> 01:34:47.596]  So I too want to thank Lord Sainsbury's and all those who have contributed to the board of Policy Network.
[01:34:48.336 --> 01:34:51.037]  And let me say it is an honour to welcome here today
[01:34:53.058 --> 01:34:56.764]  The leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, Mona Sallin.
[01:34:57.325 --> 01:35:02.213]  I'm very grateful that she has managed to be with us and I thank her for the work she's doing right across Europe.
[01:35:02.794 --> 01:35:03.455]  Commissioner Omonia.
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:08.382]  It is a great pleasure to have you here and we will have discussions later in the day.
[01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:12.384]  Pascal Lamy, the head of the World Trade Organization, is to be with us.
[01:35:13.104 --> 01:35:18.826]  And it's an honor also that we will be able to welcome Prime Minister Stoltenberg and Zapatero to Britain.
[01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:20.667]  Let's stop the clip right there.
[01:35:20.707 --> 01:35:28.071]  See, right there he's giving homage to all of his globalist crime partners and admitting we couldn't have gotten this done without you.
[01:35:28.111 --> 01:35:28.711]  Let's continue.
[01:35:29.847 --> 01:35:38.951]  The Prime Minister, as you know, has been a global leader in development and climate change, and let me thank him and Norway for their pioneering initiatives on health, education and the environment.
[01:35:39.552 --> 01:35:52.178]  And Prime Minister Zapatero, who will join us later, has inspired the world with his passion and programme for social rights, his commitment to equality for women and his discernment that Spain will lead in international aid for the poorest countries of the world.
[01:35:52.438 --> 01:35:53.560]  Alright, let's pause it right there.
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:58.908]  See, he talks about climate change, to speak to the well-meaning idiots out there, social equality.
[01:35:59.168 --> 01:36:07.320]  They cloak themselves as the heroes, as the saviors, as they openly announce despotic one-world government.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:07.721]  Let's go.
[01:36:08.642 --> 01:36:13.566]  Actions they, and so many of you have taken, founded on progressive beliefs that you hold.
[01:36:14.166 --> 01:36:21.391]  We have seen our Prime Minister Stoltenberg, Prime Minister Zapatero and all of you changing the world for the better over these last few years.
[01:36:21.872 --> 01:36:24.113]  And we're very proud of all that you have achieved.
[01:36:24.694 --> 01:36:27.576]  We thank all of you for joining us here in London today.
[01:36:28.837 --> 01:36:33.320]  Today I want us to imagine what people will say of us all a century from now.
[01:36:34.605 --> 01:36:38.207]  People look back on the moments that are the turning points in world history.
[01:36:39.348 --> 01:36:38.207]  1789, 1848, 1945, 1989.
[01:36:39.828 --> 01:36:47.132]  Only in retrospect do people see the significance of the times that they are living through.
[01:36:47.912 --> 01:36:57.738]  But in the last two years, our world has been suffering not just an ordinary economic downturn, but what will be remembered as the first crisis of globalization.
[01:36:58.038 --> 01:36:58.998]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:36:59.558 --> 01:37:02.359]  The first crisis of globalization.
[01:37:02.819 --> 01:37:05.380]  These people bring order out of chaos.
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:07.060]  They look for these crises.
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:13.101]  They create these crises in order to incrementally institute their policies.
[01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:13.601]  Let's go.
[01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:25.564]  The first crisis of a world being totally transformed by the scale of global financial flows, by the global sourcing of goods, and by the speed, the scale, and the scope of globalization itself.
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:35.089]  And it's a world of massive new opportunities that I want to talk about, but also, as we planned, a world of massive new uncertainties and insecurities too.
[01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:48.383]  What we have experienced is not just the usual inflation-driven economic crises, such as we have seen in the past 50 years, but a wholesale crisis that has gone right to the heart of the global financial system itself.
[01:37:49.341 --> 01:38:04.517]  And so it is time for us, as we reflect on these events, to draw conclusions about the new framework and the new policies we do need to build a stronger and fairer world economy that will meet the needs of its citizens in this new global age.
[01:38:05.197 --> 01:38:12.405]  Quite simply, without radical change, we will not be able to emerge from the crisis into a stronger, fairer, more stable future.
[01:38:12.645 --> 01:38:13.605]  Let's stop it right here.
[01:38:14.045 --> 01:38:16.226]  A new global age.
[01:38:16.266 --> 01:38:19.087]  They're always talking about this new age that's coming.
[01:38:19.107 --> 01:38:21.387]  We need new radical ideas.
[01:38:21.427 --> 01:38:23.668]  Everything is new, new, new, new, new.
[01:38:23.908 --> 01:38:26.009]  Global, global, global, global, global, global.
[01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:31.090]  And he's about to announce his world financial constitution.
[01:38:31.110 --> 01:38:31.690]  Hit the clip.
[01:38:31.710 --> 01:38:35.191]  What are my proposals for discussion today?
[01:38:36.091 --> 01:38:41.313]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:38:42.921 --> 01:38:50.906]  Secondly, I believe that each country needs national growth and jobs strategies that are founded on science, innovation, and skills for the future.
[01:38:50.926 --> 01:38:52.126]  Alright, let's stop.
[01:38:53.467 --> 01:38:54.328]  Now, there it is again.
[01:38:54.408 --> 01:39:01.432]  He calls for the world constitution, and then the second thing is, oh, we're going to create jobs, we're going to have a better economy.
[01:39:01.452 --> 01:39:07.075]  They always act like their solution is going to be for the betterment of humanity, Bob, but that isn't the case, is it?
[01:39:08.376 --> 01:39:08.996]  No, it's not.
[01:39:09.797 --> 01:39:10.657]  Absolutely not.
[01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.888]  This gentleman is not a gentleman.
[01:39:15.008 --> 01:39:24.635]  He's one of the most disgusting creatures in the New World Order movement on a plane with people like Henry Kissinger and the Bushes.
[01:39:26.196 --> 01:39:30.699]  And, you know, the people don't know what he's talking about.
[01:39:31.219 --> 01:39:32.500]  It just sounds good to them.
[01:39:33.461 --> 01:39:37.104]  And I talked about that today on that interview in Athens.
[01:39:37.944 --> 01:39:40.486]  And, you know, people have got to do their homework.
[01:39:41.127 --> 01:39:47.268]  They have to understand what these people have created and where they're headed with this thing.
[01:39:47.328 --> 01:39:58.651]  He's telling you, and that's what Greece was all about, and they're going to lead us into this deflationary depression down the road here, a year and a half or two or three, whatever it is.
[01:39:59.451 --> 01:40:03.352]  And from there on out, it's going to be a struggle to survive.
[01:40:04.076 --> 01:40:14.624]  And I want to bring Ted Anderson of Midas Resources up right now to tell people how they can try to survive in this global financial crisis, which Gordon Brown was just openly talking about.
[01:40:14.664 --> 01:40:26.113]  If you want to maintain the real value you worked so hard for the past 20, 30, 40 years, or you want to have a future, it is so important to get into precious metals, gold and silver.
[01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:26.353]  Ted?
[01:40:26.912 --> 01:40:27.653]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[01:40:27.693 --> 01:40:37.203]  Well, that is for sure, because your other alternative is a fiat paper currency, and every single country right now is resorting to a printing press to solve their problems.
[01:40:37.804 --> 01:40:41.307]  You know, with Greece falling apart in the... Well, I shouldn't even go to Greece.
[01:40:41.367 --> 01:40:42.889]  I mean, right here in the United States,
[01:40:43.756 --> 01:40:49.562]  The budget is so far out of whack and there's just so much debt being pounded on top of debt on top of debt.
[01:40:49.982 --> 01:40:52.144]  It's just compounding against the taxpayers.
[01:40:52.545 --> 01:40:59.151]  Really, even if we didn't have a world crisis, we will be eaten alive by the interest that is going to just consume us.
[01:40:59.691 --> 01:41:11.778]  And believe me, the United States government is to stop and stave off any kind of problems they have, they're going to go to the Federal Reserve System, the open market operation, and they're going to ask them to buy a 30-year U.S.
[01:41:11.838 --> 01:41:21.764]  Treasury bill so it can be spent into the economy, which means a lot of, a lot of new money that's being printed out of nothing, out of thin air, no value to it at all.
[01:41:21.784 --> 01:41:24.766]  And that money is going to be competing with your labor.
[01:41:25.453 --> 01:41:32.577]  And I don't know how in the world the United States citizen is going to be able to survive in a scenario like that, but that's what we're dealing with.
[01:41:32.957 --> 01:41:44.124]  And there is just absolutely no other way that you can explain it other than the fact that the United States government is willing to destroy our currency in order to fall in line, I guess, with this New World Order.
[01:41:44.144 --> 01:41:48.246]  It just simply should not, could not, should never have happened.
[01:41:48.807 --> 01:41:51.168]  The United States, the people who founded this country,
[01:41:52.165 --> 01:42:03.592]  Set up a constitution so this would not happen, and for whatever reason we decided to ignore it in 1913, and we're paying big time because of it right now, and I just, it makes me so angry.
[01:42:03.612 --> 01:42:05.774]  And we continue to ignore it, Ted.
[01:42:05.834 --> 01:42:06.334]  That's the thing.
[01:42:06.354 --> 01:42:12.918]  We continue to let it get eviscerated and ripped apart and become more and more irrelevant as the days pass on.
[01:42:13.198 --> 01:42:20.163]  It sure is, and it's taken the country that was once a great superpower and turning it into a third world country, and it's just sad to see that happen.
[01:42:20.603 --> 01:42:23.506]  But what you're talking about right now is what are we going to do about it?
[01:42:23.566 --> 01:42:29.913]  Well, Alex asked me if I'd hold that Frank price down at $249.68, even though gold now is shot up over $1,160 an ounce, close to $1,170 an ounce.
[01:42:29.933 --> 01:42:30.513]  I told him I would.
[01:42:30.533 --> 01:42:31.194]  He's on vacation.
[01:42:31.214 --> 01:42:31.554]  I wish him well.
[01:42:31.574 --> 01:42:32.776]  I hope he's having a great
[01:42:41.607 --> 01:42:41.848]  All right.
[01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:56.730]  Bob Chapman's newsletter.
[01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:57.890]  Just a great newsletter.
[01:42:58.470 --> 01:43:00.651]  And I just can't lay it out for you better than that.
[01:43:01.192 --> 01:43:04.613]  Right now you're buying gold for less than $500 an ounce.
[01:43:05.053 --> 01:43:08.735]  That's less than half of the price when you consider the discount for that subscription.
[01:43:08.775 --> 01:43:11.836]  This coin contains a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[01:43:12.868 --> 01:43:18.833]  And you can call 1-800-686-2237 or you can go to Midas Resources right now.
[01:43:19.353 --> 01:43:22.696]  Ted, explain to people where the dollar's going.
[01:43:22.876 --> 01:43:24.918]  We just see the dollar going down, down, down.
[01:43:24.978 --> 01:43:28.241]  And like you said, gold is almost up to $1,200 today.
[01:43:28.641 --> 01:43:33.305]  Once it gets past that $1,200 mark, do you think we'll be able to hit $1,500 within the next few months?
[01:43:33.525 --> 01:43:35.747]  Because we did see a large spike this year.
[01:43:36.207 --> 01:43:37.968]  Yeah, we sure have.
[01:43:38.028 --> 01:43:42.150]  And $1,500 an ounce, I think, is going to be reality before we see the calendar turn.
[01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:49.314]  I wasn't sure whether if we'd see it by spring, and I don't think we will, unless if something really radical happens right now.
[01:43:49.334 --> 01:43:55.057]  And I know that Greece has a lot of problems, but I'm sure that we're going to see $1,500 an ounce before the end of the year.
[01:43:55.477 --> 01:44:01.060]  I must predicate this, though, too, if you're getting into gold and silver, you can lose money.
[01:44:01.812 --> 01:44:02.252]  The price
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:23.023]  The amount of money that you'd get if you were to sell.
[01:44:23.423 --> 01:44:40.201]  Now I would say that gold is a much safer bet seeing as how it has a 6,000 year history of holding value and the United States currency has only been valued without gold since 1971 and has done nothing but slide down backwards and lose purchasing power.
[01:44:40.321 --> 01:44:42.564]  I think it's a safe bet to own gold right now.
[01:44:42.992 --> 01:44:43.912]  I think it's the only bet.
[01:44:43.952 --> 01:44:56.258]  I remember listening to Alex Jones back in 2003 when gold was hovering around $290 to $330 an ounce and then that just shooting up over the next four or five years.
[01:44:56.278 --> 01:44:59.779]  Then I remember, not this Christmas, but the Christmas before this, gold was around $800.
[01:44:59.919 --> 01:45:06.562]  It had peaked around $900 and I was talking to my stepfather and I'm saying, listen, you should probably get into this even though it's going down.
[01:45:07.422 --> 01:45:08.363]  I don't know, Jason.
[01:45:08.403 --> 01:45:09.404]  I don't know where it's going to go.
[01:45:09.484 --> 01:45:12.706]  And a year later, it's up around $1,100.
[01:45:13.847 --> 01:45:15.588]  So really, there is no roof on this thing.
[01:45:15.628 --> 01:45:17.369]  It's an actual precious metal.
[01:45:17.449 --> 01:45:18.830]  It's a hard currency.
[01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:20.031]  It's not a fiat currency.
[01:45:20.051 --> 01:45:23.393]  And that's why we encourage people to get involved in gold and silver.
[01:45:23.453 --> 01:45:25.434]  It's MidasResources.com.
[01:45:25.474 --> 01:45:26.195]  What's the number, Ted?
[01:45:26.515 --> 01:45:26.735]  It's 1-800-686-7000.
[01:45:31.142 --> 01:45:32.503]  2237, again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:34.905 --> 01:45:38.529]  You do have to mention that you heard it on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:45:39.009 --> 01:45:47.316]  If you don't, that coin's closer to $255, I believe it is right now, and you will not get the year's subscription to the International Forecaster.
[01:45:47.336 --> 01:45:48.698]  I mean, you can't beat the deal.
[01:45:48.758 --> 01:45:51.580]  I really have really cut it right down to the bone.
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:56.765]  I'm losing money to the point of about 50 cents on the dollar for everybody who buys from me right now.
[01:45:57.305 --> 01:46:03.490]  I just can't go much longer than this, but I will hold that until Sunday at midnight.
[01:46:03.630 --> 01:46:11.577]  So if you're interested in picking it up, and you've heard this broadcast, and you call in before Sunday at midnight, you will get this deal.
[01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:14.193]  All right, Ted, thank you so much.
[01:46:14.253 --> 01:46:16.974]  Minusresources.com is the website.
[01:46:17.034 --> 01:46:19.395]  Going back to Bob Chapman.
[01:46:20.275 --> 01:46:21.675]  Bob, you've seen it firsthand.
[01:46:22.116 --> 01:46:28.057]  People who get into the precious metals market, they have a real future because they have a hard currency.
[01:46:28.077 --> 01:46:29.198]  They have real savings.
[01:46:29.218 --> 01:46:31.178]  Their pension isn't getting gutted.
[01:46:31.198 --> 01:46:34.319]  Their 401k isn't evaporating.
[01:46:34.699 --> 01:46:36.061]  It's the only safe place to be.
[01:46:52.486 --> 01:47:04.410]  And when you have the Richard Russell Dow Theory letter, 60 years in existence, he's 86 years old now, saying, I think that the Dow's going back down to 1,000.
[01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:09.431]  The world's got a real problem in front of it, and I think he's right.
[01:47:09.871 --> 01:47:15.753]  And Joe Granville says the same thing, and so do I. So it's the only safe place to be.
[01:47:15.813 --> 01:47:21.475]  You've got to have gold and silver coins, and you've got to have, if you can,
[01:47:22.521 --> 01:47:29.052]  Uh, uh, dehydrated and freeze-dried foods and a water filter method of defending your family.
[01:47:30.822 --> 01:47:38.367]  And again, right now they're promoting that the economy is getting better, but they've been telling you that the last 6 months, the last 12 months, the last 18 months.
[01:47:38.447 --> 01:47:39.908]  Oh no, the economy's fine.
[01:47:40.208 --> 01:47:42.549]  Larry Summers told me that the recession was over.
[01:47:42.850 --> 01:47:48.713]  It doesn't matter that they're making up terms like double-dip recession when we're in a depression in this country.
[01:47:49.153 --> 01:47:51.895]  20 plus percent real unemployment.
[01:47:51.915 --> 01:47:53.836]  You were talking about that value-added tax.
[01:47:53.876 --> 01:47:54.477]  They may not even
[01:47:54.997 --> 01:47:57.499]  Go to the value added text before they start gouging prices.
[01:47:57.519 --> 01:47:58.219]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:47:58.519 --> 01:47:59.280]  Strong U.S.
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.901]  earnings seen, but may be priced in.
[01:48:02.021 --> 01:48:02.242]  U.S.
[01:48:02.322 --> 01:48:09.306]  corporate earnings should top forecasts again this quarter, but the extent of the stock market's rally means investors are expecting a lot from companies.
[01:48:09.326 --> 01:48:10.967]  So they just might charge you more.
[01:48:11.007 --> 01:48:16.911]  And again, they're giving away record bonuses after a $27 trillion plus bailout, Bob.
[01:48:16.951 --> 01:48:18.352]  These people have no shame.
[01:48:19.978 --> 01:48:20.879]  None whatsoever.
[01:48:21.419 --> 01:48:32.149]  And you know, the big cuts that they've made in order to improve their earnings, particularly last year, were in the area where 75% of their cost is.
[01:48:32.650 --> 01:48:33.531]  And that's people.
[01:48:34.131 --> 01:48:35.632]  And that's why unemployment is 22.8%.
[01:48:35.773 --> 01:48:39.956]  And they're not going to be able to continue to do that either.
[01:48:42.389 --> 01:48:46.014]  So again, what does a country look like with a 40% unemployment rate?
[01:48:46.034 --> 01:48:49.418]  I mean, that's not out of the realm of possibility at this very moment.
[01:48:49.458 --> 01:48:51.981]  There are people out there that are very hard up for work.
[01:48:52.341 --> 01:48:54.244]  In fact, I've had families call into this show.
[01:48:54.424 --> 01:48:55.425]  My mom's a teacher.
[01:48:55.886 --> 01:48:56.606]  I'm a teacher.
[01:48:56.887 --> 01:48:58.369]  My dad had a union job.
[01:48:58.429 --> 01:49:00.031]  He was laid off three years ago.
[01:49:00.131 --> 01:49:01.072]  My mom was laid off
[01:49:01.232 --> 01:49:04.373]  Last year, I just got my pink slip six months ago.
[01:49:04.413 --> 01:49:05.993]  We're a month behind on the mortgage.
[01:49:06.233 --> 01:49:07.633]  I've never not worked in my life.
[01:49:08.013 --> 01:49:10.854]  What does a country with 40% unemployment look like?
[01:49:10.934 --> 01:49:15.355]  After all, they're shutting down schools in Michigan and other states to the tune of 2 to 1.
[01:49:15.975 --> 01:49:18.956]  Literally half the schools are getting shut down in some places, Bob.
[01:49:20.016 --> 01:49:20.836]  And that's correct.
[01:49:20.936 --> 01:49:21.956]  And it will continue.
[01:49:22.517 --> 01:49:25.677]  And in the meantime, they'll go and arrange a war.
[01:49:26.217 --> 01:49:28.978]  And then people will get depressed and they'll go off and get killed.
[01:49:30.862 --> 01:49:32.423]  It is the trick of the elite.
[01:49:32.443 --> 01:49:40.510]  In fact, I believe it was Smedley Butler who said that war is the biggest racket out there and it is a racket for us to die for.
[01:49:40.890 --> 01:49:44.152]  For people that never really owned anything to begin with.
[01:49:44.413 --> 01:49:45.754]  They will create an enemy.
[01:49:45.774 --> 01:49:47.535]  They will induce fear upon you.
[01:49:47.595 --> 01:49:52.579]  They'll make you feel that jingoistic patriotic spirit where you don't question anything.
[01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:54.840]  How I felt after 9-11.
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:50:03.225]  How I felt after I thought that Muslim extremists had betrayed us on the highest level by killing men, women, and children in the World Trade Center.
[01:50:03.305 --> 01:50:13.091]  I had no idea about this globalist program for a one world order and that's why I made my latest film, Invisible Empire, a new world order to find.
[01:50:13.131 --> 01:50:14.351]  You can pre-order it today.
[01:50:14.572 --> 01:50:15.832]  We've got a sneak peek up.
[01:50:16.032 --> 01:50:17.153]  We've got a new trailer up.
[01:50:17.173 --> 01:50:19.454]  There's two great trailers out there already.
[01:50:19.494 --> 01:50:21.996]  This really is the culmination of the last
[01:50:22.276 --> 01:50:31.139]  Five to six years of heavy research into global government, global governance, one world order, new world order mentalities, and it's out of the horse's mouth.
[01:50:31.179 --> 01:50:44.063]  People like Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Michael Mullen, Steny Hoyer, George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, and many, many others, including Brent Scowcroft, Henry Kissinger, Charlie Rose, the list goes on.
[01:50:44.083 --> 01:50:46.764]  We're going to come back one final segment with Bob Chapman.
[01:50:46.784 --> 01:50:47.684]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:47.724 --> 01:50:50.485]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:59.747 --> 01:51:01.008]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.068 --> 01:51:06.412]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:06.653 --> 01:51:11.276]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:11.677 --> 01:51:16.741]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:17.241 --> 01:51:21.945]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:22.455 --> 01:51:29.377]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:29.577 --> 01:51:30.477]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:30.677 --> 01:51:33.438]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:33.458 --> 01:51:37.058]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.379 --> 01:51:40.219]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:40.559 --> 01:51:43.700]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:43.900]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:44.160]  Remember,
[01:51:52.509 --> 01:51:56.090]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:56.431 --> 01:51:58.851]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:59.872 --> 01:52:00.412]  You worry.
[01:52:00.792 --> 01:52:02.533]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:52:02.813 --> 01:52:05.054]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:52:05.374 --> 01:52:07.195]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:52:07.455 --> 01:52:08.675]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:52:09.055 --> 01:52:12.257]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:52:12.657 --> 01:52:17.519]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:52:17.899 --> 01:52:21.200]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:52:21.704 --> 01:52:23.025]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:52:23.385 --> 01:52:25.988]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[01:52:26.248 --> 01:52:29.210]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:37.717]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:52:37.997 --> 01:52:42.381]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:52:42.681 --> 01:52:46.384]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[01:54:06.897 --> 01:54:10.140]  Final segment with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:11.001]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:11.061 --> 01:54:13.183]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:54:13.303 --> 01:54:16.867]  Alex will be up in the next hour, the next segment.
[01:54:17.527 --> 01:54:27.417]  Bob, we now live in a society where they openly steal pension funds, where they're telling us that our entitlement programs, such as Social Security, that we have bought into for so many decades,
[01:54:27.717 --> 01:54:28.398]  Are you sure?
[01:54:54.372 --> 01:55:08.764]  Well, I think that the devaluations and the defaults will bring in, at that time, the cutting of these entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, probably by two-thirds for starters.
[01:55:09.805 --> 01:55:16.010]  And that'll be justified by the fact that the economy is in the tank still, and it's getting worse.
[01:55:17.411 --> 01:55:23.796]  The funding isn't there, and also the cost of this new ongoing war.
[01:55:24.808 --> 01:55:30.970]  And the amount of money the government is going to spend is not going to diminuate.
[01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.951]  It's not going to stop.
[01:55:32.031 --> 01:55:32.911]  It's going to get worse.
[01:55:34.031 --> 01:55:44.095]  And of course, all the jobs that have left the country have left the country because it was done deliberately to de-industrialize the United States.
[01:55:44.715 --> 01:55:47.636]  And that's part of bringing the United States to its knees.
[01:55:48.736 --> 01:55:53.378]  So when we have that happen over the next couple of years,
[01:55:54.099 --> 01:55:59.704]  We're also going to have a collapse in the stock market and higher interest rates, which means a collapse in the bond market.
[01:56:00.685 --> 01:56:15.459]  And with all of that said, all of the groundwork, the seed work is there, along with the war, to cut all of these costs that the government doesn't want, and of course getting rid of older people, and lots of young people too in the wars.
[01:56:17.093 --> 01:56:22.355]  And the only real question, Bob, is whether we, the people, are going to step up to the plate and say no.
[01:56:22.635 --> 01:56:38.060]  If we, the people, are going to declare that Ben Bernanke isn't truly the man of the year as Time Magazine propagates, along with Hitler and others throughout history, while he tells us that we are going to be taxed to death and that we will no longer have the programs that are taxes,
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.643]  Supposedly paid for for all those years.
[01:56:41.723 --> 01:56:57.158]  I want to encourage people to get out into the streets, to become more active, to not fall for the Johnny nonsense that is thrust upon you in the mainstream media of CNN, The Washington Post, The Washington Times, The New York Times, Fox News.
[01:56:57.278 --> 01:56:58.920]  No, they're not good either.
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:01.222]  They are still promoters of war and death.
[01:57:01.282 --> 01:57:03.504]  If you can't see that, please look at
[01:57:03.704 --> 01:57:17.469]  At those reporters and children being gunned down, judge, jury, and executioner from the sky, styled by our very own troops, the people that are supposed to be defending this country from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:57:17.509 --> 01:57:21.851]  I'm sorry, but reporters that are trying to tell the truth are not our enemies.
[01:57:21.871 --> 01:57:23.031]  So please get out there.
[01:57:23.131 --> 01:57:23.971]  Please spread the word.
[01:57:24.011 --> 01:57:29.253]  Please get my latest film, Invisible Empire, a new world order to find, and Police State 4.
[01:57:29.553 --> 01:57:30.394]  I'm in Police State 4.
[01:57:30.654 --> 01:57:31.154]  You can see me.
[01:57:31.554 --> 01:57:34.356]  No, and they don't think it's necessary for them to know those things.
[01:57:59.778 --> 01:58:05.700]  They own, they know military nomenclature and that's where it begins and ends.
[01:58:06.906 --> 01:58:08.687]  They're there protecting my freedoms.
[01:58:08.747 --> 01:58:10.707]  We're here so you got a freedom of speech.
[01:58:10.747 --> 01:58:16.269]  And I'm like, no, you're here in violation of the emergence of police and military.
[01:58:16.309 --> 01:58:26.893]  When we have the police and military on the streets, as the police, we live in a police state like that of China or Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.
[01:58:26.973 --> 01:58:28.094]  That's not my style.
[01:58:28.254 --> 01:58:30.735]  Alex Jones coming up after this segment.
[01:58:30.775 --> 01:58:31.855]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
