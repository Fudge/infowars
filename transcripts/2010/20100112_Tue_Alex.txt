[00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:06.546]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:08.308]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.069]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.651]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:12.552]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:17.396]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:21.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:34.684]  Here in Thailand, their swine flu vaccination program has just begun.
[00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:40.189]  But in other parts of the world, serious questions are being raised about the handling of the pandemic.
[00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:47.270]  Health officials around the world had believed swine flu could kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions.
[00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.935]  They introduced emergency measures and spent in excess of $20 billion on vaccines.
[00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:58.160]  But now Wolfgang Vodad, head of health at the Council of Europe, says they got it wrong.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.425]  Not only that, they were misled by the World Health Organization and unduly influenced by drug companies.
[00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:14.069]  The WHO, in cooperation with some big pharmaceutical companies and their scientists, redefined pandemics and lowered the alarm threshold.
[00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:24.882]  Those new standards forced politicians in most states to react immediately and sign marketing commitments for additional and new vaccines against swine flu and spend billions of dollars to catch up.
[00:01:26.823 --> 00:01:30.065]  France is one country feeling the prick of embarrassment.
[00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:37.808]  Officials spent a staggering 1.25 billion dollars buying 94 million doses of H1N1 vaccine.
[00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:40.849]  So far only 5 million have been used.
[00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.911]  Now the country, like many others that bought big, is trying to sell off surplus stock.
[00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:54.743]  Having committed to buy the vaccines, Dr. Vodag says health officials then sought to justify their decision.
[00:01:54.743 --> 00:01:59.585]  Never before the search for traces of a virus was carried out so broadly and intensively.
[00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:08.548]  Besides, many cases of death that happened to coincide with seropositive H1N1 lab findings were simply attributed to swine flu and used to foster fear.
[00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:16.543]  Nearly 13,000 people worldwide have died of the virus, the largest share in the United States and Canada.
[00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:22.105]  Officials say it's now peaking in Central Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East.
[00:02:22.105 --> 00:02:27.527]  But it hasn't been the killer some predicted, when the figure of 12,000 is compared to more than 250,000 people who die of seasonal flu each year.
[00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:40.327]  Dr. Vorag says the H1N1 vaccine was not sufficiently tested and was needlessly exposed to millions of healthy people.
[00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.670]  Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline have responded by saying...
[00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:48.228]  Allegations of undue influence are misguided and unfounded.
[00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:53.233]  The WHO declared that H1N1 swine flu met the criteria for a pandemic.
[00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:56.375]  Responding to it has required unprecedented collaboration.
[00:02:56.375 --> 00:03:03.562]  As WHO has stated, legal regulations and numerous safeguards are in place to manage possible conflicts of interest.
[00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.228]  And that's also being reported on BBC, all over European TV and print.
[00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:13.891]  Not much of that is making it into the United States, where we have one of the most controlled mainstream medias.
[00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:16.212]  So, go back to January of last year.
[00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:41.089]  Several months before the flu hype even began, I said, you're gonna see massive flu hype.
[00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:48.814]  I don't know if it's gonna be real or not, but the government is quietly preparing for a freakout.
[00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:58.980]  Then they ran around to all the states in the United States and in Europe, but the sub-districts, and said, this is real, don't tell the public, it's the end of the world.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.822]  We got those documents and we said, is it staged?
[00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:09.983]  Is it just a moneymaker or is it really a pandemic?
[00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:15.805]  And then we separately exposed from day one what was in the nasal and injectable flu shot.
[00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:23.468]  Cancer viruses, mercury, RNA, other chemicals.
[00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:26.889]  The list went on and on.
[00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.934]  The insert admitted it can cause Guillain-BarrÃ©, other neurological disorders, cancer, sterility, reduced fertility.
[00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:46.152]  Now the vaccine system has always been a scam, but this is one of the first cases when they stage this hype that we the people of the planet, the alternative media, have exposed them and forced this out into the open.
[00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:57.258]  So yet again, we are proven correct and we're making headway against the globalists as the majority of the population refused to take the shots, where in the past the majority would take it.
[00:04:57.258 --> 00:04:58.719]  A bunch of other key news straight ahead.
[00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.932]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.932 --> 00:05:05.833]  Number one.
[00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:09.254]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.254 --> 00:05:10.115]  Number two.
[00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:15.017]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:15.758]  It's true.
[00:05:15.758 --> 00:05:20.300]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.441]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.441 --> 00:05:25.024]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:28.948]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.948 --> 00:05:29.749]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:32.511]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:36.195]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.195 --> 00:05:36.995]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:41.139]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.904]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.164 --> 00:05:50.346]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:52.127]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:52.127 --> 00:05:54.388]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:06.294]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:09.556]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:10.957]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.664 --> 00:06:15.107]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:20.732]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:26.276]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:35.904]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:36.024 --> 00:06:38.365]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:39.965]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:42.406]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:44.246]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.246 --> 00:06:49.688]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:58.791]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:01.619]  Hi, everyone.
[00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:02.680]  Andy Anderson here.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.081]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:07:07.081 --> 00:07:12.863]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:07:12.863 --> 00:07:17.224]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[00:07:17.224 --> 00:07:18.905]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:20.406]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:24.807]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[00:07:24.807 --> 00:07:27.008]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[00:07:27.008 --> 00:07:40.072]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, moles, and fungus, too.
[00:07:40.072 --> 00:07:41.613]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[00:07:41.713 --> 00:07:44.896]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:46.057]  No more dry skin.

[00:07:57.847 --> 00:08:00.008]  That's 888-245-0300.
[00:08:00.008 --> 00:08:06.414]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.414 --> 00:08:08.696]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:44.275]  In my vital stacks before me, we have the latest Bankster or BankerGate information that could prove to be a mortal wound against the New World Order if we press the issue in this battle for truth and justice.
[00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:44.676]  Also,
[00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:54.230]  Senator Dodd is saying that the government takeover of healthcare is hanging by a thread.
[00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:01.836]  That's why they've been putting out the last month the propaganda line that it's a foregone conclusion that the bill will pass.
[00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:10.499]  It's 60-40 right now in my estimation, in my dead reckoning, that it is going to pass out of conference.
[00:09:10.499 --> 00:09:24.691]  But Democrats are exiting fast because they realize it is political suicide because it's not only Republicans, Libertarians, and Conservatives that have looked at the different versions of the bill now secretly being integrated or
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:44.870]  Splice together in conference committee between the House and Senate, but liberals, labor unions, socialists, big government collectivists have read it and are now coming to the conclusion that we told you four months ago, as we saw the earlier versions, it is a giant robbery.
[00:09:45.748 --> 00:09:47.769]  If you have a banker bailout, it's a scam.
[00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:49.550]  If you have a new war, it's a scam.
[00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.851]  If you have a big terror attack, it's a scam.
[00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:54.652]  If you have a new health care bill, it's a scam.
[00:09:54.652 --> 00:09:57.234]  That's all you're going to get out of this criminal government.
[00:09:57.234 --> 00:10:00.755]  They've already committed so many crimes, violated the Constitution.
[00:10:00.755 --> 00:10:03.577]  The banks have already committed so many crimes.
[00:10:03.577 --> 00:10:07.319]  Why not... I mean, it's like if you've committed 10 murders, why not commit 100 more?
[00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:18.403]  One of the most dangerous type of criminals, if you study criminology, is a criminal that's already robbed a bank, already shot and killed a couple people, including a police officer.
[00:10:18.403 --> 00:10:20.024]  Video of them is on the news.
[00:10:20.024 --> 00:10:20.944]  They're identified.
[00:10:20.944 --> 00:10:28.467]  The person knows they're going to the lethal injection chair, or gurney, and they have nothing to lose.
[00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:29.608]  They're deadly dangerous.
[00:10:30.646 --> 00:10:40.489]  And that's exactly the mentality, the psychology we're dealing with, with government worldwide controlled by these private offshore banking interests.
[00:10:40.489 --> 00:10:44.910]  They have nothing to lose!
[00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.090]  Nothing to lose!
[00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:52.412]  They are violating the entire Constitution, the entire Bill of Rights, in ways that are
[00:10:53.729 --> 00:10:57.612]  satirical and cartoonish if it wasn't so real and dangerous.
[00:10:57.612 --> 00:11:03.897]  It's ridiculous the things they do openly in your face.
[00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:05.859]  And so the sky's the limit.
[00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:17.808]  Giant terror attacks, new wars, World War III with Iran, police state events, plunging the economy by design, releasing bioweapons.
[00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:22.512]  Obama says get ready for bioweapon attacks and a new executive order.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:49.970]  One of the things I believe since last January before the flu hype even began and we got intel from multiple sources at the state and federal level that they were getting ready for a big flu hysteria was that I believe it would probably be a preparatory phase to test federalization and globalization under the World Health Organization to test international control over the
[00:11:51.522 --> 00:11:55.264]  Regional bureaucracies and to see if the public would buy into it.
[00:11:55.264 --> 00:11:58.526]  The public did not buy into it.
[00:11:58.526 --> 00:12:06.771]  And analyzing enemy operations and enemy psychology, that tends towards them not launching a real bio-attack now.
[00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:08.051]  They still may do it.
[00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:17.797]  But if we would have bought into this, bought into this drill, bought into this psychological operation, and we analyzed all the different variants and possibilities,
[00:12:18.982 --> 00:12:44.946]  If we would have bought into this and if we wouldn't have stood up to it and if millions of people worldwide, predominantly our listeners, wouldn't have printed out the actual vaccine drug inserts of how deadly the vaccine is, and if you hadn't gotten the word out and gone through the hell many of you did, and if nurses and doctors and police in New York State and Massachusetts and other states that tried to make it mandatory, if you wouldn't have said no,
[00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:52.434]  And they used all their psychological techniques of isolating you, making you feel like you were alone.
[00:12:52.434 --> 00:13:00.676]  If you would have failed that test, if we would have failed that test, they would have probably already released a bioweapon.
[00:13:00.676 --> 00:13:08.819]  Again, as the perfect smokescreen to take over society and further loot and to distract from all their other crimes.
[00:13:08.819 --> 00:13:13.440]  More and more they're moving towards the war crisis, the war false flag.
[00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:25.750]  So, in my stats, we have the latest on BanksterGate, the latest on government healthcare in deep trouble as people actually find out what's in it.
[00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:37.734]  We have the latest on the economy, the latest on the flu, and mainstream news openly saying it was a staged fraud by governments to grab power and by big pharma to make a bunch of money.
[00:13:38.772 --> 00:13:44.674]  That's BBC, that's Al Jazeera, that's mainstream newspapers all over the world.
[00:13:44.674 --> 00:13:49.075]  That is the European Union's head doctor.
[00:13:49.075 --> 00:13:56.337]  The WHO themselves, the World Health Organization, the World Genocide Association, are saying they're now going to investigate themselves.
[00:13:56.337 --> 00:13:59.497]  Look at this ridiculous Reuters headline.
[00:13:59.497 --> 00:14:01.998]  Who to review its handling?
[00:14:01.998 --> 00:14:05.479]  Oh, review themselves, like Janet Reno investigating herself for WACO.
[00:14:06.963 --> 00:14:11.667]  Or Bush appointing the 9-11 Commission and then calling it independent.
[00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:16.190]  That'd be like Hitler appointing Herman Goering at Nuremberg to be the head judge.
[00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.952]  Or Heinrich Himmler.
[00:14:18.952 --> 00:14:24.956]  Who to review its handling of H1N1 flu pandemic?
[00:14:24.956 --> 00:14:27.398]  The Mail Online headline and literally hundreds of others.
[00:14:27.398 --> 00:14:28.839]  The false pandemic.
[00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:32.502]  Drug firms cashed in on scare over swine flu claims Euro health chief.
[00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:37.792]  At the start of the show, we played that short Al Jazeera piece.
[00:14:37.792 --> 00:14:41.773]  You can listen to Sky TV, BBC, German-English channels.
[00:14:41.773 --> 00:14:42.993]  They're all saying the same thing.
[00:14:42.993 --> 00:14:45.674]  Total premeditated fraud.
[00:14:45.674 --> 00:14:48.995]  Indictments in the wings of WHO officials.
[00:14:48.995 --> 00:14:49.615]  Colluding!
[00:14:49.615 --> 00:14:55.617]  They talk about how it was a unified hype, a unified fraud.
[00:14:55.617 --> 00:14:59.298]  Imagine how they tried to scare the states in January before there was any talk of flu.
[00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:11.913]  In Indiana, and New York, and Texas, and California, and Florida, just some of the states that we got government documents from.
[00:15:11.913 --> 00:15:25.758]  Bureau of Prisons, New York State, Emergency Managers, Illinois, Indiana, Department of Education, Health Department consultations, in Texas,
[00:15:28.817 --> 00:15:31.298]  Department of Emergency Management, California.
[00:15:31.298 --> 00:15:50.388]  We got these documents in January and February and in March and in April, before they launched it in late April, where they were going into police departments and telling them, get ready for martial law, there will be tens of millions dead from the flu, there will be a collapse of society.
[00:15:50.388 --> 00:15:56.331]  There will be hundreds of thousands buried per cemetery, guaranteed, nationwide.
[00:15:57.273 --> 00:16:03.098]  And I went on air and I said, I don't believe they're really gonna do this, but we have to take these murderers seriously.
[00:16:03.098 --> 00:16:06.842]  Look for flu hype in the fall of 2009.
[00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:10.064]  And right on time, the staged event arrived.
[00:16:10.064 --> 00:16:17.931]  I mean, we have these people caught red-handed, hand in the false flag terror jar.
[00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:19.453]  In the cookie jar.
[00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:25.962]  And we got hacked in April when we put out exactly what they were doing in articles.
[00:16:25.962 --> 00:16:29.244]  They shut down InfoWars and Prison Planet for four days.
[00:16:29.244 --> 00:16:32.326]  Very sophisticated hacker attacks.
[00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:38.089]  My IT guys were battling them in real time in the servers as it was going on.
[00:16:38.089 --> 00:16:44.533]  I mean, clear 100% hacking from a government-slash-corporate system.
[00:16:46.915 --> 00:16:50.456]  Multi-faceted, multi-layered attacks.
[00:16:50.456 --> 00:16:54.537]  They did not want us exposing it.
[00:16:54.537 --> 00:17:09.580]  This is a very valuable radio show, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm really beginning to sense and realize and become more confident in just how accurate we are in laying out the spectrum analysis of their attack patterns.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.381]  And just how wonderful you are as an audience exposing these people.
[00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:18.801]  How precious you are that you're educated and informed.
[00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:20.582]  I've been studying this for 16, 17 years.
[00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.104]  I've been on air for now more than 14.
[00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:24.104]  I've been on the air since 1995.
[00:17:24.104 --> 00:17:25.525]  It'll be 15 years and 3 months.
[00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:30.468]  Right at 15 years on air.
[00:17:41.124 --> 00:17:47.249]  And I have learned so much and I learned so much more exponentially every day.
[00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:52.532]  Not just about government and corporations and elites and how they operate, but about everything.
[00:17:52.532 --> 00:17:55.555]  Relationships, business,
[00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.856]  Management.
[00:17:58.856 --> 00:18:02.777]  And that's why the government wants 18- to 25-year-olds in the military.
[00:18:02.777 --> 00:18:05.918]  That's why they want police officers who are young with low IQs.
[00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.058]  That's come out in mainstream news.
[00:18:07.058 --> 00:18:08.078]  Newsweek Magazine.
[00:18:08.078 --> 00:18:12.459]  All over the country, they won't hire cops the last decade above 100 IQ.
[00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:14.979]  In the past, they wanted people who were smart to be cops.
[00:18:14.979 --> 00:18:23.861]  Because they want you to be young, dumb, and arrogantly full of your own bravado.
[00:18:26.129 --> 00:18:28.974]  Macho, chutzpah, whatever you want to call it.
[00:18:30.404 --> 00:18:32.366]  They don't want you to have true wisdom.
[00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:39.971]  I mean, if I'm blessed enough to live to be 50, 60, 70, 80, I can't even begin to imagine the level of discernment and wisdom I'll have.
[00:18:39.971 --> 00:18:43.254]  Because the more I learn, the more I know I don't know.
[00:18:43.254 --> 00:18:45.916]  And that's what horrifies me as I look at the public.
[00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:51.860]  Not only do they not know which end is up, they don't want to know a large segment of the population.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.241]  They don't care.
[00:18:53.241 --> 00:18:56.264]  They don't think it's fashionable or cool to be informed.
[00:18:56.744 --> 00:19:03.308]  They think it's fashionable to talk about the Dallas Cowboys' first time in 13 years to win a playoff game.
[00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:05.509]  Or Colt McCoy hurting his shoulder.
[00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:11.473]  Or Will Lost be preempted for the State of the Union.
[00:19:11.473 --> 00:19:13.675]  You're not stupid out there.
[00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:16.776]  You're just not focused and you don't have your priorities straight.
[00:19:16.776 --> 00:19:18.397]  And I'm not talking to our general audience.
[00:19:18.397 --> 00:19:25.482]  I'm talking to the tens of thousands of new listeners that tune in on the AM and FM and shortwave and satellite and internet every day.
[00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:37.011]  And I'm telling you, you're not going to be fulfilled, and you're not going to be free, and you're not going to be safe, and you're not going to be prosperous if you don't start learning about how the world really works.
[00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:46.036]  And if you'll ever just look into how the world really works, it's addicting to actually be informed, to actually be active.
[00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:50.138]  We got a huge guest coming up today, one of the surprise guests I've been talking about.
[00:19:50.138 --> 00:19:52.780]  I'm going to let you know about that when we come back after this quick break.
[00:19:54.113 --> 00:19:59.796]  Then I'm going to get into the healthcare, then Bankergate, then the flu, a lot more important transmission.
[00:19:59.796 --> 00:20:01.817]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:20:01.817 --> 00:20:03.578]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:05.979]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[00:20:05.979 --> 00:20:09.541]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:14.323]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:19.486]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:24.569]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[00:20:24.569 --> 00:20:31.013]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[00:20:31.013 --> 00:20:32.655]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[00:20:32.655 --> 00:20:36.057]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier.
[00:20:36.357 --> 00:20:36.777]  I think so.
[00:21:01.078 --> 00:21:03.239]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:03.239 --> 00:21:04.100]  Spy on me?
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.420]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.483]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.483 --> 00:21:11.104]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:11.844]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.844 --> 00:21:12.265]  Yeah.
[00:21:12.265 --> 00:21:13.365]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.365 --> 00:21:16.327]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:16.327 --> 00:21:20.209]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:20.209 --> 00:21:22.991]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:23.331 --> 00:21:25.892]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.892 --> 00:21:27.532]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.532 --> 00:21:27.832]  Right!
[00:21:27.832 --> 00:21:31.153]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:31.153 --> 00:21:31.714]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.714 --> 00:21:33.074]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:33.074 --> 00:21:36.935]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.935 --> 00:21:40.716]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:45.858]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:45.858 --> 00:21:48.779]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.025]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:21:51.025 --> 00:21:55.317]  Try StartPage.com for 7 days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:21:55.317 --> 00:21:56.921]  That's StartPage.com
[00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:07.246]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[00:22:07.246 --> 00:22:12.190]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.273]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[00:22:16.273 --> 00:22:17.613]  Let's put this another way.
[00:22:17.613 --> 00:22:22.977]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:25.879]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[00:22:25.879 --> 00:22:28.521]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:29.902]  You can possess it in your hand.
[00:22:30.222 --> 00:22:31.503]  You can take it with you.
[00:22:31.503 --> 00:22:32.964]  Gold is real money.
[00:22:32.964 --> 00:22:34.324]  Gold is honest money.
[00:22:34.324 --> 00:22:37.046]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:37.046 --> 00:22:44.950]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.971]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[00:22:46.971 --> 00:22:47.872]  800-686-2237, extension 134.
[00:23:00.973 --> 00:23:01.634]  Hello.
[00:23:01.634 --> 00:23:06.398]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:23:06.398 --> 00:23:11.222]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:23:11.222 --> 00:23:16.006]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:23:16.366 --> 00:23:20.449]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:23:20.449 --> 00:23:24.491]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:27.293]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:23:27.293 --> 00:23:28.314]  It was empowering.
[00:23:28.314 --> 00:23:32.316]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:23:32.316 --> 00:23:35.138]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:23:35.138 --> 00:23:37.980]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.981]  Thank you so much.
[00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:41.822]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:23:41.822 --> 00:23:42.583]  Thanks again.
[00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:45.185]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:23:45.948 --> 00:23:49.352]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:23:49.352 --> 00:23:52.936]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:23:52.936 --> 00:23:56.941]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:08.475]  Guess who's joining us in the next hour?
[00:24:08.475 --> 00:24:10.217]  His maiden voyage with us!
[00:24:10.217 --> 00:24:10.617]  George Hunt!
[00:24:30.939 --> 00:24:36.623]  He worked for years with Maurice Strong, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[00:24:36.623 --> 00:24:40.025]  He was an environmentalist and found out it was all a big land grab.
[00:24:40.025 --> 00:24:42.506]  I recommended him, though he's never been with us.
[00:24:42.506 --> 00:24:47.730]  I've talked to him on the phone and played clips of some of his speeches.
[00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.651]  And he hasn't done interviews in a while.
[00:24:52.802 --> 00:24:54.403]  He is going to be joining us.
[00:24:54.403 --> 00:25:05.792]  I recommended him for the Secret Society Global Death Plot episode, one of their highest rated, for Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory TV show.
[00:25:05.792 --> 00:25:08.494]  The last episode is probably going to get picked up next year.
[00:25:08.494 --> 00:25:09.494]  It got record ratings.
[00:25:09.494 --> 00:25:11.156]  If it doesn't, something's going on.
[00:25:12.964 --> 00:25:15.745]  We are into next year in 2010.
[00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:18.126]  Should get picked up in the next season.
[00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:19.727]  But that's in negotiations right now.
[00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:23.669]  The point is he was a key part of that episode.
[00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:27.930]  I didn't want to have him on here until after he'd been on Conspiracy Theory.
[00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:28.791]  Jesse Ventura
[00:25:29.831 --> 00:25:41.379]  ...is in Mexico taking a few months off surfing, but his son Tyrell Ventura, great guy, cameraman, one of the producers on the show, did so much work and research.
[00:25:41.379 --> 00:25:47.123]  He's the guy, along with myself, that woke up Governor Ventura four years ago.
[00:25:49.485 --> 00:25:57.987]  He had already talked to his father about 9-11 being an inside job, and then when I met with Jesse in Texas four years ago and gave him the material, well, that was the chain reaction.
[00:25:57.987 --> 00:26:05.949]  So, Tyrell Ventura will be joining us tomorrow.
[00:26:05.949 --> 00:26:09.470]  One of the first radio interviews he's done.
[00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.651]  His father's a very private person and he had to get authorization from him.
[00:26:13.462 --> 00:26:17.686]  As he likes to keep his family private because of some of the persecution they went through when he was governor.
[00:26:17.686 --> 00:26:19.447]  But Tyrell is joining us.
[00:26:19.447 --> 00:26:24.712]  Very interesting, very informed person.
[00:26:24.712 --> 00:26:27.354]  And so we look forward to Tyrell Ventura tomorrow.
[00:26:27.354 --> 00:26:35.241]  But George Hunt served as a naval officer on cruisers and destroyers, held corporate positions for eight years and worked as an entrepreneur in the health industry.
[00:26:36.392 --> 00:26:46.597]  And in 91, he became very profitable, and then it goes into how he got into work with the United Nations World Conservation Bank.
[00:26:46.597 --> 00:26:51.399]  That is all coming up in the next hour.
[00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:54.760]  An eyewitness to the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, Maury Strong.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.781]  This is going to be extremely informative.
[00:26:56.781 --> 00:27:02.263]  We're going to play some clips here on air, some of which have never before been heard today.
[00:27:02.263 --> 00:27:04.905]  I want to play one now.
[00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:06.531]  uh... he uh...
[00:27:31.414 --> 00:27:40.457]  He is one of the trustees of the International Wilderness Foundation which sponsored this meeting.
[00:27:40.457 --> 00:27:43.518]  He was at the first of these congresses.
[00:27:43.518 --> 00:27:55.521]  So his conversion to the relationship between conservation and economic development has been a pioneering one.
[00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:56.942]  His work on many dams.
[00:27:57.901 --> 00:28:03.923]  He's, you know, I used to be in the hydroelectric power part of the energy business myself.
[00:28:03.923 --> 00:28:18.967]  And the many of the energy developments we've seen have come from his early anticipation of our energy needs and his early work in supporting pioneering initiatives to deal with these needs.
[00:28:18.967 --> 00:28:20.248]  There he is introducing
[00:28:21.792 --> 00:28:22.513]  Rothschild.
[00:28:22.513 --> 00:28:24.854]  There are so many of these clips.
[00:28:24.854 --> 00:28:30.958]  We're going to try to play most of them today and get George Hunt to comment on them.
[00:28:30.958 --> 00:28:34.861]  He was kind enough to put them to MP3 and send them to us.
[00:28:34.861 --> 00:28:48.690]  But we're going to give a general overview of how this plan works, how this program works, coming up in the next hour with George Washington Hunt.
[00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.791]  Gotta love that middle name.
[00:28:51.761 --> 00:28:59.485]  George Washington Hunt joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:28:59.485 --> 00:29:04.748]  Now when I come back I'm going to get into the health care takeover and detroubled.
[00:29:04.748 --> 00:29:07.089]  Senator Dodd saying it's quote hanging by a thread.
[00:29:07.089 --> 00:29:16.213]  But I'm going to get into the latest on Bankstergate and then after Hunt leaves us in the third hour I'm going to detail what really happened with Flugate.
[00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:17.314]  That's now what it's being called.
[00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:21.426]  People say, why do we put gate on the end of all these?
[00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:29.552]  Because the public associates that with Watergate and it means government scandal that could bring down the whole system.
[00:29:29.552 --> 00:29:30.693]  So that is coming up.
[00:29:30.693 --> 00:29:36.937]  We have some other special announcements as well today.
[00:29:36.937 --> 00:29:45.103]  And we're going to have open phones coming up in the third and fourth hour as well.
[00:29:46.561 --> 00:29:49.165]  He's got his maiden visit with us.
[00:29:49.165 --> 00:29:51.509]  George Hunt, coming up.
[00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:52.912]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.912 --> 00:29:55.436]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.436 --> 00:29:58.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.294 --> 00:30:04.296]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.296 --> 00:30:09.619]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.619 --> 00:30:11.680]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.683]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.683 --> 00:30:17.604]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.844 --> 00:30:18.985]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.985 --> 00:30:20.867]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.867 --> 00:30:21.927]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.927 --> 00:30:24.129]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:24.129 --> 00:30:25.470]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.012]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:27.012 --> 00:30:32.276]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:35.859]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:39.342]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.682 --> 00:30:40.903]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.903 --> 00:30:41.804]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.804 --> 00:30:42.904]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.904 --> 00:30:43.845]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.845 --> 00:30:44.926]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:47.988]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.988 --> 00:30:50.189]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:50.189 --> 00:30:51.190]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:02.521 --> 00:31:06.568]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.568 --> 00:31:09.813]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.813 --> 00:31:11.216]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.603]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.603 --> 00:31:20.989]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.989 --> 00:31:26.033]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.033 --> 00:31:36.163]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:36.283 --> 00:31:38.625]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:40.207]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:40.207 --> 00:31:42.669]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:44.812]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.812 --> 00:31:49.957]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.957 --> 00:31:54.962]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:54.962 --> 00:31:59.066]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:05.757]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:09.022]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:32:09.022 --> 00:32:16.834]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[00:32:17.074 --> 00:32:17.594]  We're good to go.
[00:32:37.987 --> 00:32:38.367]  Let's go!
[00:33:07.066 --> 00:33:10.529]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:33:10.529 --> 00:33:14.612]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:33:14.612 --> 00:33:16.313]  Someone who cares.
[00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:41.814]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, the 12th day of January, 2010 on this Tuesday edition.
[00:33:41.814 --> 00:33:50.558]  We're going to simulcast the second, third, and fourth hours today of the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv in living color.
[00:33:50.558 --> 00:33:55.181]  You can watch this live here in studio with the document cam, the video clips.
[00:33:55.181 --> 00:33:59.163]  It adds a whole other dimension to it if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:33:59.163 --> 00:34:01.204]  The special ends Friday.
[00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.872]  The special ends Friday evening.
[00:34:05.872 --> 00:34:09.294]  We run it every December, partway into January.
[00:34:09.294 --> 00:34:13.236]  Five and a half months free when you sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:13.236 --> 00:34:14.297]  Here's the discount.

[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.822]  It comes out to like $34 something.

[00:34:27.024 --> 00:34:28.825]  Or close to half off.
[00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:29.545]  I guess it's 45% off or so.
[00:34:33.385 --> 00:34:41.492]  So, you can also get a trial membership for $5.95 a month, the cost of a couple cups of Starbucks coffee.

[00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.412]  It's been up now more than five years.
[00:35:05.412 --> 00:35:12.840]  In April, it will be the sixth year anniversary of PrisonPlanet.TV and we just keep adding more and more.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.101]  It keeps getting better and better.
[00:35:14.101 --> 00:35:16.424]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:35:24.409 --> 00:35:28.772]  Also, we are offering a new video.
[00:35:28.772 --> 00:35:36.076]  And again, I turn down more than 90% of the books and videos that I get mailed that people ask us to carry in our online video bookstore.
[00:35:36.076 --> 00:35:38.758]  I only carry the best.
[00:35:38.758 --> 00:35:44.942]  But when I saw this new film, I didn't just say I wanted to carry it, I said I wanted to endorse it and get behind it.
[00:35:46.684 --> 00:35:52.206]  And so we're going to be promoting this film and discounting it out of the gates at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:52.206 --> 00:35:54.808]  And we just got our big shipment of these in today.
[00:35:54.808 --> 00:35:58.889]  So before this hour ends, I'm going to play the trailer for this new film.
[00:35:58.889 --> 00:36:01.350]  And I am going to let you know how you can get it.
[00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:06.353]  So that is coming up.
[00:36:06.353 --> 00:36:08.574]  Something has happened.
[00:36:08.574 --> 00:36:09.714]  Something beautiful.
[00:36:09.714 --> 00:36:11.275]  Something wondrous.
[00:36:11.275 --> 00:36:13.336]  The globalists are running out of steam.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:28.845]  They have suckered the public so many times, conned the public, lied so many times, that the population, not just of North America, the United States and Canada, but the population of the world is waking up to the true power structure.
[00:36:28.845 --> 00:36:40.289]  That a private offshore banking cartel is openly establishing a global corporate dictatorship, a governmental system of tyranny known as global governance or the new world order.
[00:36:41.052 --> 00:36:42.673]  That's what the elites call it.
[00:36:42.673 --> 00:36:47.117]  Global Governance or New World Order or International Collective.
[00:36:47.117 --> 00:36:55.724]  Those are some of the words and we've got clips of Maury Strong coming up where he says we're going to collectivize all the money of the corporations and pay it into the UN, i.e.
[00:36:55.724 --> 00:37:00.288]  the Rothschilds and Rockefellers who were at attendance and spoke at these events.
[00:37:00.288 --> 00:37:01.529]  We've got clips of them coming up.
[00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.352]  And so now the people aren't looking at the Tories or Labor in England.
[00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:11.614]  They're not looking at the Republicans or Democrats.
[00:37:11.614 --> 00:37:30.825]  Oh, they're looking at them, but they're following the strings attached to their arms and legs and heads and their mouths up to the actual puppeteers, the people controlling the marionettes, the political androids, the political meat puppet
[00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:41.733]  Political whores and prostitutes and pimps that are looting and robbing our society.
[00:37:41.733 --> 00:37:43.893]  And sure, they bait and switch.
[00:37:43.893 --> 00:37:49.055]  Republicans get into power, push the establishment agenda, get caught four to eight years later.
[00:37:49.055 --> 00:37:51.356]  There's a peaceful political revolt.
[00:37:51.356 --> 00:37:57.117]  The Democrats are put in, and then four to eight years later, the Republicans are put back in.
[00:37:57.117 --> 00:37:58.678]  They lean on each other.
[00:37:58.678 --> 00:38:02.219]  They share power in this endless dance.
[00:38:03.499 --> 00:38:05.940]  It's choreographed at the highest level.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:22.324]  Sure, Democrats and Republicans fight sometime over who gets committee chairmanships or who gets power, who gets political contributions, and they attack each other sometimes with scandals, but it's all contained on the football field, on the stage.
[00:38:22.324 --> 00:38:31.247]  It is an event, a staged event in total, because there are many things that they're not allowed to talk about.
[00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:40.993]  World government, corrupt corporations, Pentagon corruption, government looting, police corruption.
[00:38:40.993 --> 00:38:46.218]  They keep that off limits and sell you the idea that government's your God, government's going to save you.
[00:38:46.218 --> 00:38:50.623]  When Republicans get in office, government gets bigger, tramples more of the Constitution.
[00:38:50.623 --> 00:38:54.246]  The Democrats get in, government gets bigger, they trample the Constitution.
[00:38:54.246 --> 00:38:55.287]  I know you know this.
[00:38:56.323 --> 00:39:05.265]  But the point is, you may have known this decades ago, the general public is just now beginning to realize this, and realizing there's a problem.
[00:39:05.265 --> 00:39:18.667]  It's kind of like when you got an old house, say your grandma dies, and you go out there to see the old house she was living in, you're deciding whether to sell it or not, and you put your arm up against the side of it while you're talking to your neighbor, and your arm goes through the wall.
[00:39:18.667 --> 00:39:19.288]  Termites!
[00:39:19.288 --> 00:39:20.768]  And you pull your arm out and you go, ugh!
[00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:22.516]  There's termites!
[00:39:22.516 --> 00:39:23.917]  This house is rotten!
[00:39:23.917 --> 00:39:25.858]  The question is, how rotten is it?
[00:39:25.858 --> 00:39:30.902]  Well, I've gone in as a termite exterminator, and I've actually inspected the house.
[00:39:30.902 --> 00:39:37.546]  And let me tell you, every board, the roof, the foundation, everything is rotten.
[00:39:37.546 --> 00:39:38.787]  The house is condemned.
[00:39:38.787 --> 00:39:41.369]  Termites have eaten everything.
[00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:42.510]  The roof is sagging.
[00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.111]  Walls are sagging.
[00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:46.793]  One big wind, it's gonna fall over.
[00:39:48.069 --> 00:40:02.219]  And the globalists want all the nation states that they've sucked dry and engineered into their hands to collapse when they want in a staged progression, incrementally, into their hands and into the world government.
[00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:05.641]  No!
[00:40:05.641 --> 00:40:13.127]  No, the termites have convinced us to build them a new house of world government and they've now convinced us to move them into the new house
[00:40:15.307 --> 00:40:21.373]  And I'm saying no, we're not going to move into the new termites house, and we're not going to move the termites into the new house.
[00:40:21.373 --> 00:40:23.996]  We're not going along with what you've done.
[00:40:23.996 --> 00:40:36.088]  We are going to identify you as termites, and we are going to expose you as termites, and we are going to remove you and bring you to justice as the big, fat, greedy termites you are.
[00:40:41.169 --> 00:40:52.050]  I was like 11 years old one summer for a month I worked with one of my cousins who was a termite exterminator for a month and I tell you we climb underneath those houses we go in
[00:40:53.476 --> 00:41:00.639]  We'd see houses sometimes so damaged by termites, we'd just tell them, you're gonna have to get the insurance company in here and have half this house torn out and repaired.
[00:41:00.639 --> 00:41:03.020]  I mean, there's really nothing you can do.
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.401]  We can poison the termites that are here, but this house is ruined.
[00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:08.722]  And we need to come to grips with that.
[00:41:08.722 --> 00:41:14.004]  Whatever solutions the termites give us, for healthcare, or the borders,
[00:41:14.964 --> 00:41:20.605]  Or wars, or national security, or terrorism, or the flu.
[00:41:20.605 --> 00:41:24.986]  Anything the termites do is going to be to the detriment of society.
[00:41:24.986 --> 00:41:28.326]  Because they're termites.
[00:41:28.326 --> 00:41:36.588]  It's an old African, or is it an old Middle Eastern proverb of the frog.
[00:41:36.588 --> 00:41:40.248]  And he's sitting there by the river, and a scorpion comes over.
[00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:43.689]  And he says, hey, will you let me on your back and take me across the river?
[00:41:44.639 --> 00:41:45.619]  No, you're a nice frog.
[00:41:45.619 --> 00:41:46.180]  You're friendly.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:46.900]  That's your nature.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:47.961]  You're nice.
[00:41:47.961 --> 00:41:50.442]  And the frog says, yeah, my nature is to be nice and friendly.
[00:41:50.442 --> 00:41:51.302]  No, you're a scorpion.
[00:41:51.302 --> 00:41:51.903]  You'll sting me.
[00:41:51.903 --> 00:41:53.443]  You'll kill me.
[00:41:53.443 --> 00:41:58.025]  And the frog says, so I'm not going to carry a cross.
[00:41:58.025 --> 00:42:02.348]  So the scorpion replies, look, I promise you, I'm not going to sting you.
[00:42:02.348 --> 00:42:02.968]  Be my friend.
[00:42:04.332 --> 00:42:05.934]  You know you were going to swim across anyways.
[00:42:05.934 --> 00:42:07.775]  I see you looking at the other side of the bank.
[00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:09.757]  Some big tasty flies over there.
[00:42:09.757 --> 00:42:13.921]  Why don't you just let me on your back and carry me across and I promise I won't sting you.
[00:42:13.921 --> 00:42:17.524]  So the frog says, OK, I want to be nice.
[00:42:17.524 --> 00:42:18.726]  I've got a sweet nature.
[00:42:18.726 --> 00:42:19.887]  Go ahead and climb on my back.
[00:42:19.887 --> 00:42:23.930]  I'm going to swim across and let you ride on my back.
[00:42:24.781 --> 00:42:31.806]  And so they get to the other side, the frog sitting there at the edge of the water with his front feet up on the bank.
[00:42:31.806 --> 00:42:36.609]  And the scorpion climbs off and gets on the other side of the bank and stings him.
[00:42:36.609 --> 00:42:42.853]  And the frog is in incredible pain, rolls over on his back and he says to the scorpion in his dying words, why did you sting me?
[00:42:42.853 --> 00:42:44.655]  You promised, you promised.
[00:42:44.655 --> 00:42:47.857]  And the scorpion said, I'm a scorpion!
[00:42:50.063 --> 00:42:52.544]  I mean, this is so elementary.
[00:42:52.544 --> 00:43:03.386]  The Founding Fathers taught us, history teaches us, common sense shows us, you get a big government, it will be taken over by criminals.
[00:43:03.386 --> 00:43:09.648]  Now normally, big governments are started and pushed by criminals because they want power and to rob you.
[00:43:09.648 --> 00:43:17.590]  But let's just say in some fantasy land, Alex and Wonderland, let's just say in this fantasy world,
[00:43:20.111 --> 00:43:25.932]  That government could be big and helpful and angelic handing out free goodies.
[00:43:25.932 --> 00:43:28.433]  Taking it from the haves and giving it to the have-nots.
[00:43:28.433 --> 00:43:30.434]  That's how they always sell it to the general public.
[00:43:30.434 --> 00:43:33.934]  The Soviet system, the Nazi system, everything.
[00:43:33.934 --> 00:43:35.615]  Oh, we're going to give you something free.
[00:43:35.615 --> 00:43:37.875]  Just give us the power to steal from others.
[00:43:37.875 --> 00:43:39.156]  We won't keep it ourselves.
[00:43:39.156 --> 00:43:39.936]  We're going to give it to you.
[00:43:42.793 --> 00:43:46.675]  So let's just say, magically you could get a good government that was big.
[00:43:46.675 --> 00:43:50.436]  A government big enough to give you anything you want, big enough to take everything away from you.
[00:43:50.436 --> 00:43:52.837]  It's been said many times, truthfully.
[00:43:52.837 --> 00:44:01.460]  And accurately.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:07.963]  Over time, even if you had a good, big government, which doesn't exist, just like a moon made of cheese doesn't exist,
[00:44:10.575 --> 00:44:25.104]  Even if you had that unknown quantity, that unknown country, that unknown alchemist substance of a good big government, it will be taken over by tyrants in course.
[00:44:25.104 --> 00:44:30.948]  We had a good small government and it still wasn't perfect and a lot of bad things to select groups.
[00:44:32.455 --> 00:44:44.767]  But it was better than anything that had ever been seen in the history of the world, and it produced more patents, and more science, and more wealth, and more intelligence and strength than any other country ever had.
[00:44:44.767 --> 00:44:45.648]  That was the United States.
[00:44:45.648 --> 00:44:53.696]  But empires, countries, nations, systems, through entropy, always become corrupt.
[00:44:55.205 --> 00:45:02.829]  And it became corrupt, and now it is the biggest, meanest, most corrupt system on the planet, completely predatory.
[00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:07.452]  The globalists compete with each other on who can be more ruthless, who can be more cunning.
[00:45:07.452 --> 00:45:15.796]  They have their own methodologies, their own rationalizations, their own corporate cultures.
[00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:18.798]  They are piratical monsters.
[00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:28.793]  And anything that comes out of this government that is pushed by the establishment.
[00:45:28.793 --> 00:45:32.075]  Sometimes the people push something through this Constitution and it's good.
[00:45:32.075 --> 00:45:36.396]  But that's maybe one out of a hundred things that happens.
[00:45:36.396 --> 00:45:44.220]  The best we can hope for is to just block new outrages because finally they've been exposed for the crooks they are.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:50.443]  The best we can do is try to have criminal indictments, continue to expose these people, continue to educate the general public.
[00:45:52.043 --> 00:45:59.428]  Education of the public about who their true enemies are and the true nature of the world is the number one tool we have against these people.
[00:45:59.428 --> 00:46:01.170]  It's the number one solution.
[00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.331]  Identifying the enemy.
[00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:05.233]  Identifying the system.
[00:46:05.233 --> 00:46:07.434]  Identifying the rules of the game.
[00:46:07.434 --> 00:46:08.935]  The rigged game.
[00:46:08.935 --> 00:46:15.520]  So that then people stop playing the game.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.962]  Not being a nation in a world of spectators.
[00:46:19.278 --> 00:46:23.722]  But being a nation in a world of critical thinkers.
[00:46:23.722 --> 00:46:25.283]  And now is our moment of truth.
[00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:28.606]  They plan this year for total blanket amnesty.
[00:46:28.606 --> 00:46:31.548]  Does it matter if over 90% of Americans in major polls are against it?
[00:46:31.548 --> 00:46:33.250]  They're gonna try.
[00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.813]  They are attempting to pass the government takeover of healthcare right now.
[00:46:36.813 --> 00:46:39.375]  It doesn't matter if it destroys the Democratic Party.
[00:46:39.375 --> 00:46:40.436]  They're bought and paid for.
[00:46:42.182 --> 00:46:50.306]  You watch, the Republicans aren't going to repeal it when they get in office, unless we truly inform the general public about the rigged game.
[00:46:50.306 --> 00:46:53.488]  And that is happening, that's the good news.
[00:46:53.488 --> 00:47:07.235]  Because generally they can play partisan politics and play little tricks, like they did in 1913, having the private banks that own the Federal Reserve System they were trying to pass, say that they were against the Federal Reserve System.
[00:47:10.256 --> 00:47:14.517]  And so the public got snookered, but still that wasn't enough.
[00:47:14.517 --> 00:47:19.618]  The whole public didn't get snookered, bamboozled, conned.
[00:47:19.618 --> 00:47:28.301]  And so they still had to have a handful of Senators on Christmas Eve pass it.
[00:47:28.301 --> 00:47:30.701]  And they're doing the same thing now.
[00:47:30.701 --> 00:47:36.863]  They've paid out all these bribes, they've engaged in all these payoffs to Senators and House members, totally illegal.
[00:47:37.662 --> 00:47:41.525]  They've written the bill where it's selectively enforced.
[00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:46.630]  Where major unions are exempt, but small companies and businesses and sole proprietorships aren't.
[00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.331]  Totally unconstitutional.
[00:47:48.331 --> 00:47:52.254]  Unjust weights and measures.
[00:47:52.254 --> 00:47:53.235]  It's unequal.
[00:47:53.235 --> 00:47:57.599]  It's like saying blacks can't go to the water fountain or the bathroom or the lunch counter.
[00:48:04.008 --> 00:48:10.030]  And they tried to come out and say the insurance companies are against these bills for healthcare takeover when they wrote them.
[00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:14.852]  And now, the left and the right have finally read the bills and understand.
[00:48:14.852 --> 00:48:20.614]  The right needs to understand this isn't some commie, socialist takeover of healthcare.
[00:48:20.614 --> 00:48:27.116]  This is a banker-controlled, through the insurance company, looting.
[00:48:27.116 --> 00:48:29.737]  It's actually the Democrats, Howard Dean and others,
[00:48:34.059 --> 00:48:41.204]  that are telling the truth i was on raw story this morning big liberal website about how the health care bill
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:49.861]  This is a scam and every single commenter was going, I'm a liberal and this is a rip-off to the insurance companies.
[00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:52.182]  This raises my taxes and cuts my benefits.
[00:48:52.182 --> 00:48:53.642]  This is a scam.
[00:48:53.642 --> 00:48:54.962]  This is tyranny.
[00:48:54.962 --> 00:49:07.965]  Every single commenter, there were 30-something commenters, the story had just gone up, and I read them all and every stinking one of them understood that the banks are criminal, that it's a world government, that it's a new world order.
[00:49:07.965 --> 00:49:09.445]  They were in there saying that.
[00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:13.234]  And then I went to Republican sites against it.
[00:49:13.234 --> 00:49:14.155]  They got it.
[00:49:14.155 --> 00:49:16.817]  They said, this is banks looting us, robbing us.
[00:49:16.817 --> 00:49:20.840]  They weren't calling it tree-hugging liberals trying to get something free.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.581]  That's how it's always sold.
[00:49:22.581 --> 00:49:26.264]  And that's bad enough.
[00:49:26.264 --> 00:49:31.247]  No, this is going to go into the pockets of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others.
[00:49:31.247 --> 00:49:33.769]  They're the ones that own and control the insurance companies.
[00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:34.570]  They wrote the bill.
[00:49:39.151 --> 00:49:55.983]  And it is so exciting to see the fact that even if they pass this, it will continue to shatter the left-right paradigm, and we will get control of our Congress, and we will repeal, and the states are fighting the unconstitutional provisions already before the bill even passes.
[00:49:55.983 --> 00:49:59.285]  Attorney Generals are lining up in 18 states.
[00:49:59.285 --> 00:50:01.327]  The people are finally getting it.
[00:50:06.564 --> 00:50:11.088]  I mean, here are some of the news articles today.
[00:50:11.088 --> 00:50:16.692]  Labor angry over Obama-backed insurance tax.
[00:50:16.692 --> 00:50:19.915]  If you got a nice health care plan, they're going to tax it.
[00:50:19.915 --> 00:50:26.100]  I thought the point of health care was that your employer provide good health care as part of your benefits.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:34.387]  Dodd health reform bill hanging by a thread as Democrats realize it is suicide politically to go for this.
[00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:42.546]  And I have other articles along the same lines.
[00:50:42.546 --> 00:50:45.869]  And so the people are finally figuring it out.
[00:50:45.869 --> 00:50:48.912]  The Democrats are finally figuring it out.
[00:50:48.912 --> 00:50:51.775]  They're finally understanding that both parties are controlled.
[00:50:51.775 --> 00:50:54.157]  Republicans are finally figuring it out.
[00:50:54.157 --> 00:50:59.643]  This is a huge realignment away from both parties and towards the Constitution.
[00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.954]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:51:04.954 --> 00:51:08.858]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:51:08.858 --> 00:51:12.583]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:51:12.583 --> 00:51:19.891]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[00:51:19.991 --> 00:51:20.351]  I think so.
[00:51:45.703 --> 00:51:47.704]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:47.704 --> 00:51:49.985]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:49.985 --> 00:51:51.425]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.952 --> 00:52:14.635]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.635 --> 00:52:21.020]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:26.085]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.085 --> 00:52:36.214]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:36.314 --> 00:52:38.675]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.675 --> 00:52:40.256]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:40.256 --> 00:52:42.717]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.717 --> 00:52:44.838]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.838 --> 00:52:49.980]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:53:02.686]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:02.686 --> 00:53:04.847]  Our economy is in great distress.
[00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:09.126]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[00:53:09.126 --> 00:53:14.650]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.312]  You have auto and home insurance.
[00:53:17.312 --> 00:53:20.514]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[00:53:20.514 --> 00:53:23.817]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term?
[00:53:23.817 --> 00:53:26.479]  Because it might take years to recover.
[00:53:26.479 --> 00:53:32.143]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[00:53:33.004 --> 00:53:40.329]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.

[00:53:48.435 --> 00:53:52.918]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[00:53:52.918 --> 00:53:58.742]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:54:10.083 --> 00:54:21.527]  In the third hour today, I'm going to break down more of what's in the conference bill and how the fact that it's causing a huge revolt in the Democratic Party as well as the Republican Party
[00:54:22.734 --> 00:54:31.479]  And how every politician that's voted for it in the House and Senate are plunging as much as 35 points in their approval ratings with their constituents.
[00:54:31.479 --> 00:54:33.520]  That is coming up.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:39.423]  Plus, the whole flu hoax by the government has blown up completely in their face globally.
[00:54:39.423 --> 00:54:45.286]  The latest on Bankstergate, Tim Geithner in deep trouble, but it doesn't need to stop there.
[00:54:45.286 --> 00:54:46.247]  It is all coming up.
[00:54:47.489 --> 00:54:58.059]  We are carrying a new film titled Shadow Government and the Global Elite Plan to Destroy Democracy and Your Freedom by Grant R. Jeffrey.
[00:54:58.059 --> 00:55:00.421]  And I saw this film and I was just so impressed.
[00:55:00.421 --> 00:55:02.042]  They contacted me, wanted me to carry it.
[00:55:02.042 --> 00:55:04.004]  It just came out this week.
[00:55:04.004 --> 00:55:06.386]  I was sent an advanced copy.
[00:55:06.386 --> 00:55:09.229]  And yes, I'm getting firmly behind this film.
[00:55:09.229 --> 00:55:11.011]  The production quality, the information.
[00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:20.307]  It's got just Spanish language options, extra interviews.
[00:55:20.307 --> 00:55:24.050]  It's got Catherine Albrecht in it.
[00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:30.594]  It's got, of course, G. Edward Griffin and countless others.
[00:55:30.594 --> 00:55:32.115]  It exposes the global government.
[00:55:33.467 --> 00:55:35.428]  And it's a film that everyone needs to see.
[00:55:35.428 --> 00:55:38.429]  It's now on sale out of the gates at InfoWars.com.

[00:56:04.389 --> 00:56:06.953]  Why do I have to come down?
[00:56:06.953 --> 00:56:10.778]  Monitor every human being on the planet.
[00:56:10.778 --> 00:56:14.343]  I don't know how they knew all about us.
[00:56:14.343 --> 00:56:19.510]  A big government will take more and more of their rights away from them.
[00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:21.213]  Are you aware, yes or no?
[00:56:23.158 --> 00:56:28.539]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:56:28.539 --> 00:56:31.280]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.981]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:38.421]  We are warned of such a global system.
[00:56:38.421 --> 00:56:43.242]  The great experiment that was once America has been prostituted by special interests.
[00:56:43.242 --> 00:56:49.884]  All they're thinking about is, oh, government, do something, protect me, save us from all of this.
[00:56:49.884 --> 00:56:51.524]  We are living in the last days.
[00:56:54.264 --> 00:56:58.746]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:57:55.692 --> 00:58:01.356]  And it does have a Christian perspective on it, so it's a great way to wake up people in your local churches.
[00:58:02.341 --> 00:58:06.306]  Who many of which are vastly asleep or partially asleep.
[00:58:06.306 --> 00:58:09.189]  This can wake them out of their sleep.
[00:58:09.189 --> 00:58:17.138]  So just an amazing documentary and it's good to see big time producers getting involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:58:17.138 --> 00:58:19.681]  This is actually from the producers of Left Behind the movie.
[00:58:21.016 --> 00:58:23.897]  So, you know, I don't really get into the whole rapture thing.
[00:58:23.897 --> 00:58:25.857]  They don't really cover that in here.
[00:58:25.857 --> 00:58:32.919]  You know, the issue is, this is exposing it from a Christian perspective, and it's a great way, and it's good to have these folks getting on to some really hardcore issues.

[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:56.221]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.221 --> 00:59:58.982]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:10.528]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.528 --> 01:00:12.089]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.089 --> 01:00:13.009]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:17.851]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.851 --> 01:00:21.893]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:32.322]  Well, a lot of you know him from Jesse Ventura's top-rated show on TruTV.
[01:00:32.322 --> 01:00:37.968]  I recommended him for the research episode, Secret Societies Global Death Plot.
[01:00:40.063 --> 01:00:43.485]  And I believe that's his maiden voyage on national television.
[01:00:43.485 --> 01:00:48.347]  And it's his first time joining us here on the radio for this hour, perhaps a little bit of the next hour.
[01:00:48.347 --> 01:00:53.830]  We're going to be playing key audio clips that he recorded at conferences he attended and put on.
[01:00:53.830 --> 01:01:00.193]  He was the head of many of these high-powered conferences with Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Maurice Strong.
[01:01:00.193 --> 01:01:02.975]  And so joining us is George Washington Hunt.
[01:01:03.675 --> 01:01:03.895]  I think?
[01:01:22.236 --> 01:01:23.898]  I'm glad to be here, Alex.
[01:01:23.898 --> 01:01:26.220]  Every chance I get to spread the bad news, that's my job.
[01:01:47.438 --> 01:01:55.485]  Well, you know, people sometimes... I went to the Fourth World Wilderness Congress on September 11, 1987.
[01:01:55.485 --> 01:02:07.456]  I went there because my son had been killed in a wilderness area the later part of the year, or about a few months before.
[01:02:08.698 --> 01:02:21.442]  I was very sad, and also my other son, that was still living, said he wanted to repair huts along the Arctic for travelers, and he wanted to get into a job.
[01:02:21.442 --> 01:02:35.326]  So I heard the Fourth World Wilderness was coming to town, and with all its reindeer and pretty little bright lights, and I said, you know, maybe I could go there and rub shoulders with the Smokies, with the forest rangers, and get my son a job.
[01:02:36.434 --> 01:02:42.616]  And so I went down to the Congress and I saw the pictures of the reindeer and so on.
[01:02:42.616 --> 01:02:48.277]  But then I noticed on the program that there was another aspect away from Denver.
[01:02:48.277 --> 01:02:57.200]  The first two days of this Wilderness Congress, supposed to be pro-conservation, the first two days were in Denver.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:05.682]  And then they moved a quasi-secret meeting up to the YMCA of Estes Park, Colorado.
[01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:18.138]  So, with my resourceful mind, I said to myself, I'd like to get into that Congress, but I didn't have any money.
[01:03:18.138 --> 01:03:28.544]  And then, lo and behold, I got the information that one of the official hosts of the meeting was ill with the flu.
[01:03:28.544 --> 01:03:29.765]  I got his number.
[01:03:29.765 --> 01:03:30.686]  I called him.
[01:03:30.686 --> 01:03:32.987]  He says, yeah, take my place.
[01:03:32.987 --> 01:03:35.189]  I was interviewed by about four
[01:03:36.072 --> 01:03:38.474]  Yes, well they were involved here too, Alex.
[01:04:00.023 --> 01:04:01.164]  They all run together.
[01:04:01.164 --> 01:04:06.648]  The psychics, the cults, the witches, the devils, the...
[01:04:10.358 --> 01:04:13.640]  The near-rich that want to get into the crowd.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.181]  It's a whole mishmash.
[01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:17.043]  And there's video of this that you shot.
[01:04:17.043 --> 01:04:21.785]  I mean, over time you became the leader of the conferences and we're going to get into that.
[01:04:21.785 --> 01:04:23.807]  How these twists of fate got you in this position.
[01:04:23.807 --> 01:04:25.328]  So we're going to break in a moment.
[01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:28.670]  Let's come back with George Hunt.
[01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:29.490]  Goes.
[01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.832]  He wants a spot at this event.
[01:04:31.832 --> 01:04:33.072]  This conservation event.
[01:04:33.072 --> 01:04:35.254]  You end up getting one of the places and one of the hosts.
[01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:39.566]  And then suddenly you're with Rothschilds, Rockefellers.
[01:04:39.566 --> 01:04:41.127]  How did this happen?
[01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:44.810]  You're approved by psychics to be able to go by them.
[01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:46.912]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[01:04:46.912 --> 01:04:54.058]  And I've done separate research from George Hunt, confirming what he said about Maury Strong and others.
[01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:58.442]  They want a one-world religion, as Al Gore is now openly saying.
[01:04:58.442 --> 01:04:59.603]  We'll be right back with George Hunt.
[01:05:00.745 --> 01:05:05.308]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.308 --> 01:05:06.208]  Number one.
[01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:09.631]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:10.491]  Number two.
[01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:15.394]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.394 --> 01:05:16.135]  It's true.
[01:05:16.135 --> 01:05:20.998]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.998 --> 01:05:21.458]  Number three.
[01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:25.401]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.401 --> 01:05:30.124]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:30.124 --> 01:05:32.886]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.886 --> 01:05:37.369]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:37.369 --> 01:05:41.492]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.492 --> 01:05:46.276]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.556 --> 01:05:50.720]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.502]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.502 --> 01:05:54.764]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:54.764 --> 01:05:57.107]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:02.452 --> 01:06:06.413]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.413 --> 01:06:15.276]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:15.276 --> 01:06:19.897]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.897 --> 01:06:30.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:40.862]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.862 --> 01:06:46.304]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:46.304 --> 01:06:53.785]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.785 --> 01:06:56.526]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:01.107 --> 01:07:05.209]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:07:05.209 --> 01:07:08.091]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:10.172]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:07:10.172 --> 01:07:12.414]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:07:12.414 --> 01:07:14.075]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:18.557]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:07:18.557 --> 01:07:21.119]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:26.922]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:07:27.122 --> 01:07:31.906]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:07:31.906 --> 01:07:34.748]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:07:34.748 --> 01:07:37.470]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:44.936]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:49.040]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:49.340]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.321]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web.
[01:07:55.845 --> 01:08:00.067]  He's set to meet the man who pulls together all the threads, George Hunt.
[01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:15.213]  It's not truly really about saving the planet from carbon dioxide.
[01:08:15.213 --> 01:08:16.715]  It's about making money.
[01:08:16.715 --> 01:08:19.158]  At an international level.
[01:08:19.158 --> 01:08:22.323]  We're not even talking here about country, country, country.
[01:08:22.323 --> 01:08:26.329]  We're talking about a global type money making thing, correct?
[01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.489]  Yes.
[01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:40.735]  We're talking about a powerful, immense aristocracy that has the intention of using the fear of the environment to deteriorate.
[01:08:40.735 --> 01:08:46.237]  They're going to use it to take over the world.
[01:08:46.237 --> 01:08:50.739]  George Hunt was an official at the World Wilderness Congress when he met Maurice Strong in 1987.
[01:08:50.739 --> 01:08:55.841]  The Congress is an international forum for discussing the environment.
[01:08:57.236 --> 01:09:09.752]  But Maury Strong showed up to introduce a new player, financier Edmund de Rothschild of the Rothschild Banking Dynasty, and a proposal to create something called a World Conservation Bank.
[01:09:11.761 --> 01:09:20.604]  One of the most important initiatives that is open here is that of the Conservation Banking Program.
[01:09:20.604 --> 01:09:32.428]  We have as our chairman, fortunately, the person who epitomizes that positive synthesis between environment, conservation, on the one hand, and economics on the other.
[01:09:32.428 --> 01:09:38.210]  And I'm just delighted to have this opportunity of introducing to you Edmund DeRoccia.
[01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:50.965]  Maury Strong was in charge of the conservation movement, but he was also Edmund de Rothschild's right-hand man.
[01:09:50.965 --> 01:09:57.910]  You have money and the environment in one person, Edmund de Rothschild.
[01:09:57.910 --> 01:10:00.753]  Now, Maury Strong, I found out during...
[01:10:04.642 --> 01:10:09.471]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live the rest of the hour, a little bit of the next hour.
[01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:12.777]  George Hunt is our guest to go in-depth.
[01:10:12.777 --> 01:10:16.624]  So, he's just looking into conservation jobs for his son.
[01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:20.744]  One of the presenters is sick.
[01:10:20.744 --> 01:10:22.365]  He says, I'd like to go.
[01:10:22.365 --> 01:10:25.448]  Suddenly, he's being vetted by them by psychics.
[01:10:25.448 --> 01:10:32.154]  And from my separate research, this is on record, Maury Strong has a weird cult compound in Colorado.
[01:10:32.154 --> 01:10:33.935]  It ties into Bohemian Grove.
[01:10:33.935 --> 01:10:35.517]  The UN, of course, is into the occult.
[01:10:35.517 --> 01:10:36.317]  He brought that up.
[01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:37.759]  That's coming up later.
[01:10:37.759 --> 01:10:42.503]  OK, going back to George Hunt, naval officer, corporate businessman.
[01:10:44.164 --> 01:10:45.865]  Yes, I had luncheon with the Rothschilds.
[01:10:45.865 --> 01:10:47.026]  They were very nice people.
[01:11:09.185 --> 01:11:14.628]  Lady Rothschild stood up when I came to the table and she filled my glass.
[01:11:14.628 --> 01:11:20.831]  And suddenly I said, thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies, my cup runneth over.
[01:11:20.831 --> 01:11:25.413]  And I was with the president of the World Conservation Bank.
[01:11:25.413 --> 01:11:27.954]  And I said, Michael,
[01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:36.457]  Sweetman, how is this bank going to survive if the asset base is Arctic lands?
[01:11:36.457 --> 01:11:39.039]  They don't produce any dividends and interest.
[01:11:39.039 --> 01:11:41.341]  He says, oh, we are worried.
[01:11:41.341 --> 01:11:45.745]  We are working on that, he said in his precise English.
[01:11:45.745 --> 01:11:52.891]  I said, you're working on it and you're going to have a seminar in a half an hour where you're going to accept this bank?
[01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:55.253]  What's going on, Michael?
[01:11:55.253 --> 01:11:59.599]  He said, you'll have a chance to ask us at the seminar.
[01:11:59.599 --> 01:12:02.903]  I looked him in the eye and said, Michael, are you going to call on me?
[01:12:02.903 --> 01:12:04.384]  Looked me in the eye, Michael.
[01:12:04.384 --> 01:12:05.586]  Yes, I promised.
[01:12:05.586 --> 01:12:09.250]  Well, when we went to the seminar, and of course, he didn't call on me.
[01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:12.414]  It was a contrived Congress, and they accepted the bank.
[01:12:13.624 --> 01:12:21.571]  And we haven't seen it yet, but it's coming down the road, and there'll be one bank, one credit card, one of everything.
[01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:30.820]  And if you cross that bank and don't do what they want, or the owners want, you'll lose your credit card privilege, and you won't be able to buy or sell.
[01:12:31.693 --> 01:12:37.197]  Now let's fast forward 24 years, or 23 years to 2010.
[01:12:37.197 --> 01:12:43.602]  I now have London Guardian, Associated Press headlines, Rothschild's established global environment bank.
[01:12:43.602 --> 01:12:46.804]  Rothschild's established global carbon credit bank.
[01:12:46.804 --> 01:12:53.389]  It's now mainstream news, what you whistle-blew on decades ago, after you got deeper into the groups, we're going to cover that.
[01:12:53.829 --> 01:12:55.390]  Yes, that's what I want people to wake up at.
[01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:56.870]  This is a conspiracy going on.
[01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:59.292]  It's no longer a conspiracy theory.
[01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.332]  It's a conspiracy fact.
[01:13:16.246 --> 01:13:17.346]  Okay, so continue.
[01:13:17.346 --> 01:13:25.648]  So you're at the meeting, you're at the table with the Rothschilds, because by twist of fate, you got the ticket or the seat of one of the presenters who had the flu.
[01:13:25.648 --> 01:13:27.688]  Go ahead.
[01:13:27.688 --> 01:13:37.790]  Then my fellow workers came up to me and they said, George, we have to talk to you about something.
[01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:42.531]  David Rockefeller has sent us a message that if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to regret it.
[01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:51.675]  Shortly after that, after the meeting, I was talking with a talk show host and he said, did you get Guillain-Barre Syndrome yet?
[01:13:51.675 --> 01:13:54.037]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[01:13:54.037 --> 01:13:55.497]  He said, GBS.
[01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:59.460]  It seems like everyone that gets close to the bone with World Order gets it.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:02.461]  Well, I just got out of the hospital with GBS.
[01:14:02.461 --> 01:14:05.203]  So there's something there, don't you think?
[01:14:05.891 --> 01:14:16.322]  Oh, we know they have a lot of programs with soft kill weapons, but expanding on this, because you got the video out of there at other events, so out of the gate... I got the tape of the event.
[01:14:16.322 --> 01:14:18.785]  As far as I know, it's the only tape in existence.
[01:14:19.864 --> 01:14:20.925]  I can't figure that out.
[01:14:44.527 --> 01:14:47.308]  First of all, I hadn't done anything wrong, though.
[01:14:47.308 --> 01:14:49.009]  I was an official host.
[01:14:49.009 --> 01:14:52.490]  So why was David Rockefeller telling you to shut up?
[01:14:52.490 --> 01:15:00.893]  I had a regular association with Maury Strong there.
[01:15:00.893 --> 01:15:03.554]  Then, after the Congress, I went down.
[01:15:03.554 --> 01:15:06.795]  Some Christians down in San Luis Valley called me.
[01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:08.656]  They said, George, you have to come down here.
[01:15:08.656 --> 01:15:10.937]  Maury Strong is up to all kinds of tricks.
[01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:25.615]  And that's where I was able to, through them, expose Maurice Strong's water scam that he was going to pump water to cities and turn the San Luis Valley, thousands of miles, into a dust bowl.
[01:15:25.615 --> 01:15:38.579]  So here's the convener of the Environment Congress that met in Estes Park, going down 200 miles to the San Luis Valley and turning the place into a dust bowl.
[01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:48.513]  It was that hypocrisy that caused me to invest, up till now, $250,000 in exposing this guy.
[01:15:48.513 --> 01:15:54.763]  And I've got some information today for you that is going to blow him out of the water.
[01:15:58.419 --> 01:15:58.979]  Amazing.
[01:15:58.979 --> 01:16:08.502]  So again, now we see it all over the news, how the UN and big corporations are grabbing up the water in the third world, the first world, developing world, cutting it off.
[01:16:08.502 --> 01:16:10.442]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:16:10.442 --> 01:16:15.584]  Here you are in the late 80s seeing this at its embryonic formation.
[01:16:15.584 --> 01:16:16.524]  Yes.
[01:16:16.524 --> 01:16:19.945]  I saw it as an embryo and now I'm seeing it as an ugly fetus.
[01:16:22.284 --> 01:16:27.652]  Now from the videos and audios I've seen of you, you then found out about this.
[01:16:27.652 --> 01:16:29.895]  We'll continue with that first conference, what they said.
[01:16:29.895 --> 01:16:33.059]  We've got a bunch of audio clips here.
[01:16:33.059 --> 01:16:36.685]  But continue into other meetings that you were able to infiltrate.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:44.241]  Oh, I've infiltrated many meetings, but not one of this importance.
[01:16:44.241 --> 01:16:59.645]  Because the Secretary of the Treasury Baker was there, the head of the IMF, the head of the World Bank, Rothschild, Edmund Rothschild, the chief banker of the world, David Rockefeller, da-da-da-da, and I knew there was something going on.
[01:16:59.645 --> 01:17:02.246]  It would take an idiot not to understand it.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.621]  And again, your own record as being part of the conference.
[01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.942]  You got the documents out.
[01:17:07.942 --> 01:17:13.204]  Later newspapers, major newspapers have written stories about it on the Ventura TV show.
[01:17:13.204 --> 01:17:14.324]  They showed those.
[01:17:14.324 --> 01:17:18.466]  I mean, this was a stroke of divine intervention.
[01:17:18.466 --> 01:17:19.186]  It was God.
[01:17:19.186 --> 01:17:21.427]  It was what you call an incident.
[01:17:21.427 --> 01:17:22.868]  Coincidence.
[01:17:22.868 --> 01:17:28.250]  Because I received a prophecy in the Christian Church about 12 years earlier that I was going to do this.
[01:17:29.204 --> 01:17:31.605]  So it was, it was a piece of cake.
[01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:36.246]  I walked through it without any fear and knowing that God was on my side.
[01:17:36.246 --> 01:17:44.749]  Wait a minute, so someone told you specifically, or did you recognize what was happening as it was happening, or did you like, after the fact, go, oh my God?
[01:17:44.749 --> 01:17:46.570]  It was later, after the fact.
[01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:48.250]  This is a prophecy.
[01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:50.631]  We are going into the wilderness.
[01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:53.472]  We are going on an adventure together into the wilderness.
[01:17:55.270 --> 01:18:03.917]  I am going to loose you upon the ravenous beasts of the world, and then you will return to me, and I will protect you.
[01:18:03.917 --> 01:18:07.019]  I am your jailer for your good and mine.
[01:18:07.019 --> 01:18:08.560]  And that was the prophecy.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:18.007]  And then after I went to the Wilderness Congress, I realized I had been in the wilderness, and he was loosening me upon the ravenous beasts of the world.
[01:18:18.007 --> 01:18:19.228]  I knew them face to face.
[01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:20.719]  Amazing.
[01:18:20.719 --> 01:18:24.122]  Now, let's go back to this meeting, though, this key meeting you got into.
[01:18:24.122 --> 01:18:26.103]  Then you went and witnessed their sub-meetings.
[01:18:26.103 --> 01:18:31.646]  So, go over again the date, the time, the place, and who was there.
[01:18:31.646 --> 01:18:33.588]  Okay.
[01:18:33.588 --> 01:18:46.516]  David Rockefeller, Edmund de Rothschild, Secretary of the Treasury Baker, head of the IMF, don't remember his name, head of the World Bank, the head of the United Nations in Geneva.
[01:18:46.516 --> 01:18:49.118]  I had dinner with him one night.
[01:18:49.118 --> 01:18:49.678]  He kind of
[01:18:50.854 --> 01:18:56.016]  Found out that my questions were a little too close to the boat.
[01:18:56.016 --> 01:19:01.317]  Then there were the Smokies were there, all the four strangers.
[01:19:01.317 --> 01:19:07.719]  Of course, Maurice Strong was there as a Secretary General, convening this Congress.
[01:19:07.719 --> 01:19:18.743]  And girl Harlem Bruteland, I think of her as kind of a concentration camp lady because she's in charge of reducing the population of the world.
[01:19:18.743 --> 01:19:19.843]  That's what her job is.
[01:19:20.826 --> 01:19:34.431]  She was the head of the World Health Organization for about six years, and she is also a member of a new club with Jimmy Carter and Tutu and some other people.
[01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:41.933]  It's called The Elders, and The Elders have direct contact with the Club of Rome.
[01:19:41.933 --> 01:19:42.653]  All right, stay there.
[01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:43.274]  We've got a break.
[01:19:43.274 --> 01:19:47.715]  Let's continue along that line, and then other meetings you went to.
[01:19:47.715 --> 01:19:49.756]  Just amazing stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:51.585 --> 01:19:57.835]  I mean, there's videos out there of our guests introducing Maury Strong and the rest of them right in the middle of all of this.
[01:19:57.835 --> 01:20:00.219]  This is an absolute eyewitness on the inside.
[01:20:01.894 --> 01:20:06.496]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[01:20:06.496 --> 01:20:14.279]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[01:20:14.279 --> 01:20:29.084]  The revolutionary Berkey-like systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels, and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:04.132]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:04.132 --> 01:21:04.772]  January 12th, 2010.
[01:21:04.772 --> 01:21:05.853]  Gold opened this morning at $1149.40.
[01:21:05.853 --> 01:21:08.835]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1180.55, $590.27 for a half ounce, or $295.14 for the quarter ounce.
[01:21:08.835 --> 01:21:09.335]  That's $1180.55, $590.27, or $295.14.
[01:21:21.022 --> 01:21:34.651]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:21:34.651 --> 01:21:35.912]  Is this capitalism?
[01:21:35.912 --> 01:21:43.477]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:43.477 --> 01:21:44.597]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:44.597 --> 01:21:48.720]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.181]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.181 --> 01:21:54.844]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:21:54.844 --> 01:21:58.087]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:58.087 --> 01:22:02.630]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:06.633]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:06.633 --> 01:22:09.895]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:09.895 --> 01:22:11.296]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:22:12.009 --> 01:22:14.671]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:14.671 --> 01:22:21.075]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:21.075 --> 01:22:26.599]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:26.599 --> 01:22:36.245]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:36.365 --> 01:22:38.706]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:38.706 --> 01:22:40.287]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:40.287 --> 01:22:42.748]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:42.748 --> 01:22:44.889]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:44.889 --> 01:22:50.031]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:59.135]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:01.235 --> 01:23:03.657]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:23:03.657 --> 01:23:05.558]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:23:05.558 --> 01:23:07.400]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.841]  We paid off all of our bills.
[01:23:08.841 --> 01:23:11.623]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[01:23:11.623 --> 01:23:17.287]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[01:23:17.287 --> 01:23:18.968]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:23:18.968 --> 01:23:21.570]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:22.031]  No More Mortgage.
[01:23:24.052 --> 01:23:25.333]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.834]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:23:27.834 --> 01:23:31.737]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:23:31.737 --> 01:23:33.898]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.
[01:23:33.898 --> 01:23:39.221]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your credit.

[01:23:48.786 --> 01:23:49.186]  This works.
[01:23:49.186 --> 01:23:49.627]  Call the number.
[01:23:53.769 --> 01:23:54.630]  Call now for your free CD.

[01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:54.750]  800-578-6279.
[01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:56.871]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:58.192]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:24.857 --> 01:24:25.280]  Yeah!
[01:24:32.054 --> 01:24:36.036]  Okay, George, I've been throwing a lot of questions in here, and you're dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[01:24:36.036 --> 01:24:37.277]  So you're at this U.N.
[01:24:37.277 --> 01:24:38.337]  conference.
[01:24:38.337 --> 01:24:47.942]  Of course, Maurice Strong was later the head of the official biological diversity meeting in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, the Earth Summit.
[01:24:47.942 --> 01:24:52.364]  He's the guy that says publicly we must destroy the industrial society for Gaia.
[01:24:52.364 --> 01:24:54.986]  Now Al Gore's new film and book is about religion.
[01:24:54.986 --> 01:24:57.307]  We're going to get into the religious aspect of this.
[01:24:57.987 --> 01:24:59.848]  Yes, her name is Gro Harlem Bruteland.
[01:24:59.848 --> 01:25:06.013]  She prepared the Bruteland Report, which was used as the basis of the Fourth World Wilderness Congress Foundation.
[01:25:06.013 --> 01:25:06.613]  The Bruteland Report.
[01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:32.231]  And her analysis is that 2 billion people have to be removed from the planet.
[01:25:32.231 --> 01:25:35.451]  2 billion.
[01:25:35.451 --> 01:25:40.092]  Now there's other figures that go down as low as 500 million.
[01:25:40.092 --> 01:25:52.235]  So we have a sinister element in our government that is twisting the law so that they can annihilate people early.
[01:25:53.496 --> 01:26:00.182]  They say the globe, the Earth, is not large enough for six billion people.
[01:26:00.182 --> 01:26:05.126]  Now, I take issue with that because I'm one of the guys that will be cooked.
[01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:08.709]  So you can see I do have a selfish motive in fighting all this stuff.
[01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:17.676]  Well, plus it's a fraudulent model and it's been proven these globalists have bigger carbon footprints and more children than even third world populations.
[01:26:17.676 --> 01:26:21.159]  I mean, these are a bunch of greedy people that want the Earth for themselves.
[01:26:22.301 --> 01:26:24.542]  Yes, they want the Earth for themselves.
[01:26:24.542 --> 01:26:26.983]  You got it right on the head.
[01:26:26.983 --> 01:26:31.584]  And they don't like us cannon fodder that unfortunately populates the Earth.
[01:26:31.584 --> 01:26:33.865]  I got a recording of that.
[01:26:33.865 --> 01:26:39.647]  An elitist banker from Canada actually saying that.
[01:26:39.647 --> 01:26:50.050]  Let's do this bank without telling the cannon fodder about it that unfortunately inhabits the Earth.
[01:26:50.595 --> 01:26:54.817]  That's when I said, I'm going to make war on these guys.
[01:26:54.817 --> 01:26:59.079]  And I haven't stopped for 22 years.
[01:26:59.079 --> 01:27:01.721]  Well, you've done a great job exposing them.
[01:27:01.721 --> 01:27:03.182]  I want to continue here.
[01:27:03.182 --> 01:27:05.283]  Okay.
[01:27:05.283 --> 01:27:09.265]  So how did the conference end, and then what other conferences did you attend?
[01:27:09.265 --> 01:27:12.266]  Okay.
[01:27:12.266 --> 01:27:15.668]  The Congress ended by Rothschild
[01:27:16.471 --> 01:27:25.915]  Presenting his banking program to the Congress to grow our own broodland to present to the United Nations in October of 1987.
[01:27:25.915 --> 01:27:31.798]  That was the end of it.
[01:27:31.798 --> 01:27:32.618]  Now since then,
[01:27:34.178 --> 01:27:43.140]  You know, everyone's complaining about Maury Strong allegedly taking a $1 million bribe from the U.N.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:58.424]  and the Oil for Food Program, and Fox just fouled him up by exposing him to the Copenhagen Congress.
[01:27:58.424 --> 01:28:01.905]  He made billions there, and I'll announce it to you right now.
[01:28:02.699 --> 01:28:11.263]  He got $8 million when he sold the Baca for water rights, which he did not own.
[01:28:11.263 --> 01:28:31.612]  In other words, it seems to me that there was fraud committed, either at the Nature Conservancy level or Cabeza de Baca Land Company level, but someone can easily find that $8 million that he got, and I hereby blow the whistle on it.
[01:28:32.315 --> 01:28:41.023]  Well here's that Fox News report on global warming, follow the money, and it talks about Maury Strong and everything he's been involved in.
[01:28:41.023 --> 01:28:49.391]  And I know these fake conservancy groups in Austin with the city took more than 15,000 acres from people and didn't pay them one-tenth of what it was worth.
[01:28:49.391 --> 01:28:53.975]  Then they turned around a few years later and took the restrictions off and built on it themselves.
[01:28:54.994 --> 01:28:56.755]  See that's the kind of stuff they do.
[01:28:56.755 --> 01:29:09.202]  They manure themselves through these institutions and acronymical corporations like ABC Corporation and you can't follow their trail.
[01:29:09.202 --> 01:29:19.308]  Maurice Strong tried to bury his trail when he left the United States in a hurry because I reported him to the Congress for
[01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:20.591]  We're good to go.
[01:29:34.651 --> 01:29:35.592]  Until 2 a.m.
[01:29:35.592 --> 01:29:36.592]  in the morning.
[01:29:36.592 --> 01:29:47.700]  If I had written to him, they would have passed it and AWDI, Maurice Strong's company, would have been off and rolling to... Alright, George, stay there.
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:48.981]  Good job fighting that.
[01:29:48.981 --> 01:29:51.703]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:51.703 --> 01:29:53.124]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.124 --> 01:29:55.646]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.646 --> 01:29:58.328]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:06.191]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:06.191 --> 01:30:09.432]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.432 --> 01:30:14.213]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:30:14.213 --> 01:30:20.615]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:22.856]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.396 --> 01:30:23.696]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.696 --> 01:30:24.217]  Bernanke?
[01:30:24.217 --> 01:30:24.877]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.877 --> 01:30:26.178]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:26.178 --> 01:30:28.419]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.307 --> 01:30:49.570]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:58.693]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:01.445 --> 01:31:04.468]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.468 --> 01:31:09.792]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.792 --> 01:31:11.834]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.834 --> 01:31:16.838]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:18.019]  How much do you want?
[01:31:18.019 --> 01:31:19.160]  When do you want it?
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.041]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:21.041 --> 01:31:21.842]  When will you need it?
[01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:24.284]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:24.284 --> 01:31:25.625]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.625 --> 01:31:27.166]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:27.166 --> 01:31:32.430]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:36.012]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:36.012 --> 01:31:39.475]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.835 --> 01:31:41.056]  How much will you need?
[01:31:41.056 --> 01:31:41.957]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.957 --> 01:31:43.058]  How much do you want?
[01:31:43.058 --> 01:31:43.999]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:45.100]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:48.143]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:48.143 --> 01:31:50.386]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:50.386 --> 01:31:51.347]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.799 --> 01:32:01.959]  What's your home worth?
[01:32:01.959 --> 01:32:04.080]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:07.101]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:32:07.101 --> 01:32:14.823]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:33:14.727 --> 01:33:18.109]  TheBigBadBank.com is his website.
[01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.990]  He's George Hunt.
[01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:22.152]  Again, TheBigBadBank.com.
[01:33:22.152 --> 01:33:23.233]  One word.
[01:33:23.233 --> 01:33:23.693]  Check it out.
[01:33:23.693 --> 01:33:27.956]  We'll tell you about a great documentary he produced coming up later that you can get on the site.
[01:33:27.956 --> 01:33:29.217]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[01:33:29.217 --> 01:33:38.224]  Of course, our websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, as well as InfoWars.net, and WhatIsTheEndGame.com.
[01:33:38.224 --> 01:33:42.447]  My film, End Game, exposes this globalist dehumanization agenda
[01:33:42.947 --> 01:33:45.649]  That they're pushing through the phony environmental movement.
[01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:48.030]  This is the religion of the big bankers.
[01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:50.312]  We're going to get into their religion, what makes them tick.
[01:33:50.312 --> 01:33:56.656]  George Hunt has tracked them, been in their meetings, been around them by a twist of fate and the good Lord above.
[01:33:56.656 --> 01:34:02.700]  We've got a bunch of audio clips we're going to be playing and getting his take on that as well.
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:09.264]  But for years he was exposing Maury Strong before it ever even became a mainstream media issue.
[01:34:09.264 --> 01:34:11.826]  But give me a document cam shot for
[01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:18.991]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and for radio listeners, I'll give you these headlines so you can check them out for yourself.
[01:34:18.991 --> 01:34:25.895]  The article he mentioned from Fox with Maury Strong being confronted by the news for making lots of money off of Copenhagen.
[01:34:25.895 --> 01:34:27.956]  So that's going on.
[01:34:27.956 --> 01:34:29.477]  Here's an article out of Reuters.
[01:34:29.477 --> 01:34:34.980]  Rothschild E3 launched carbon credit investment fund that people will pay their taxes to.
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:36.781]  That's Reuters.
[01:34:36.781 --> 01:34:38.883]  Everything he was talking about 20 years ago.
[01:34:40.565 --> 01:34:41.106]  Here's another one.
[01:34:41.106 --> 01:34:45.029]  Maury Strong linked to all these bizarre cults.
[01:34:45.029 --> 01:34:47.451]  We're going to be covering that with him as well.
[01:34:47.451 --> 01:34:50.213]  His wife setting up a Gaia Earth religion.
[01:34:50.213 --> 01:35:07.046]  The UN said in 96 in their biological diversity assessment, and I even have a clip of them at the UN saying, we must worship our mother goddess, and now they're teaching the children these chants in public schools and private schools that are accredited, and they now admit it's going to be a global religion.
[01:35:07.046 --> 01:35:07.387]  In fact,
[01:35:08.456 --> 01:35:10.017]  Where are those magazines I had in here?
[01:35:10.017 --> 01:35:11.279]  I guess I've already cleaned it up.
[01:35:11.279 --> 01:35:12.920]  Will you ask Aaron, because he took them out?
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:13.260]  No, no, no.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:14.201]  Here they are.
[01:35:14.201 --> 01:35:15.723]  Here they are.
[01:35:15.723 --> 01:35:17.224]  Look at this.
[01:35:17.224 --> 01:35:19.826]  There's so many of these, I just thought to show you this.
[01:35:19.826 --> 01:35:29.896]  Here is Outside Magazine likening the new heir to the Rothschild family, the son of the person that George Hunt was exposing.
[01:35:31.684 --> 01:35:35.687]  Here he is, the hero Gene, how to tap into yours.
[01:35:35.687 --> 01:35:40.290]  And then you open it up and it talks about him being like Jesus.
[01:35:40.290 --> 01:35:46.835]  You open it up and it talks about him being a Christ figure.
[01:35:46.835 --> 01:35:50.718]  I mean, this is just so incredibly sickening.
[01:35:50.718 --> 01:35:51.899]  They call him Jesus here.
[01:35:51.899 --> 01:35:53.260]  Give me a close shot of this.
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:56.943]  Plastics Jesus, the Savior, how to be a hero.
[01:36:00.544 --> 01:36:05.645]  And again, here they are on the cover of the magazine, the hero gene, how to tap into yours.
[01:36:05.645 --> 01:36:07.146]  This is your role model.
[01:36:07.146 --> 01:36:13.167]  A guy that got on my show, he's openly called for global government by the way at Copenhagen on Bloomberg TV.
[01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:19.428]  A guy got on my show and I said, well Mars' ice caps have been getting smaller too from solar system warming from the sun.
[01:36:19.428 --> 01:36:21.129]  And he said, well that's because Mars is closer
[01:36:21.829 --> 01:36:25.471]  to the sun and earth and I said no it's not it's the next planet out.
[01:36:25.471 --> 01:36:26.471]  Then it's the gas giants.
[01:36:26.471 --> 01:36:28.392]  He said no it's not and laughed at me.
[01:36:28.392 --> 01:36:29.853]  He was laughing at the audience.
[01:36:29.853 --> 01:36:31.834]  He thinks you're like the general public.
[01:36:31.834 --> 01:36:32.434]  Here's another one.
[01:36:32.434 --> 01:36:34.395]  The thinking man's thinking man.
[01:36:34.395 --> 01:36:36.756]  The eco-prophet gets real.
[01:36:36.756 --> 01:36:37.837]  Al Gore.
[01:36:37.837 --> 01:36:39.538]  See he's a prophet.
[01:36:39.538 --> 01:36:45.981]  It's all a religion but that's coming up and he's going to be with us at least 20 minutes to the next hour because there's so many facets to cover.
[01:36:45.981 --> 01:36:46.481]  George Hunt.
[01:36:46.481 --> 01:36:49.803]  Before we get into the religious angle and the scams they're running
[01:36:50.643 --> 01:37:04.713]  I want to play some audio clips and get into some of the other questions you sent me that you think are important to get into, but working with them, being around them, and finding out who they were, tracking them, what is their bottom line?
[01:37:04.713 --> 01:37:18.103]  I mean, I don't know if you've seen my film, Endgame, but from the UN documents, from their statements, it's a planetary dictatorship to then carry out the orderly extermination of at least 80% of the world population.
[01:37:18.103 --> 01:37:19.224]  You know, you caught me
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.141]  At a standstill.
[01:37:22.141 --> 01:37:25.304]  I'm not familiar with that.
[01:37:25.304 --> 01:37:28.086]  Well, I need to send you a copy of my film, Endgame.
[01:37:28.086 --> 01:37:31.469]  But specifically, there are plans for population reduction.
[01:37:31.469 --> 01:37:33.991]  Did you ever run into that?
[01:37:33.991 --> 01:37:36.233]  Well, I have.
[01:37:36.233 --> 01:37:37.054]  Yes, I have.
[01:37:37.054 --> 01:37:40.637]  But it's rather grim.
[01:37:40.637 --> 01:37:44.560]  I believe that the World Health Organization has included AIDS
[01:37:49.949 --> 01:37:55.431]  virus into their inoculations that they're doing for the good of mankind, of course.
[01:37:55.431 --> 01:37:59.913]  And that's why we're seeing the population dying of AIDS in Africa.
[01:37:59.913 --> 01:38:02.113]  They've been caught.
[01:38:02.113 --> 01:38:03.094]  Yes, that's on record.
[01:38:03.094 --> 01:38:09.016]  A sister country of Rwanda said the bank credit Leone's.
[01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:14.658]  They've since gone out of business, but they're the ones who financed the Rwandan massacre.
[01:38:15.259 --> 01:38:18.763]  They sent it to the president of Rwanda, who is working with them.
[01:38:18.763 --> 01:38:25.312]  And, you know, I come across these terrible things that are going on in the planet, even while we speak.
[01:38:25.312 --> 01:38:26.493]  It's terrible.
[01:38:27.602 --> 01:38:38.005]  Well, we know the UN was involved in financing the Rwandan massacre of Christians because they wanted their property for big oil companies and mining companies and financed by banks.
[01:38:38.005 --> 01:38:44.126]  I'm not particularly familiar with the bank you mentioned, but what type of world do they want to build?
[01:38:44.126 --> 01:38:49.207]  And how are they using environmentalism to sell the public on giving up their rights?
[01:38:49.207 --> 01:38:56.009]  They are gearing society towards a feudalistic society, in my opinion.
[01:38:56.795 --> 01:39:06.060]  Where they'll have lords of the manors, the Duchess of Boulder and the Queen of Las Vegas.
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:16.385]  You know, they'll adopt titles and stuff, but go into a feudalistic society similar to what we had in the Middle Ages.
[01:39:16.385 --> 01:39:21.248]  And they will also introduce the worship of Mother Earth as part of the religion.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:29.695]  Uh, so that we will somehow tie in the religion with acceptance of the world order.
[01:39:29.695 --> 01:39:32.621]  Uh, that's all I can say vaguely about where they're headed.
[01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:53.601]  Now I've got these audio clips and then I want to get into some of their religious beliefs and I mean having psychics vet you to be able to go to the conference, the secret conference, I mean just the bizarreness and that sounds crazy to people that don't research them, but openly UN documents talk about the occult and how much they believe in it.
[01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:57.782]  Uh, what would you, how would you sum up their Earth religion?
[01:39:57.782 --> 01:40:00.122]  I mean, because that's a broad title, Earth religion.
[01:40:00.122 --> 01:40:01.863]  We see the new movie Avatar.
[01:40:01.863 --> 01:40:03.283]  It's all about Earth religion.
[01:40:03.283 --> 01:40:08.924]  Uh, but, but I mean, how would you sum up their, their Earth religion?
[01:40:08.924 --> 01:40:15.426]  Honey Strong, Maury Strong's wife, is the head of the Earth religion cult.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:25.424]  Uh, she, uh, Creston, Colorado has been chosen as the center because that is where the Eastern religions meet the Western religions.
[01:40:25.424 --> 01:40:39.411]  They say that's the point there where God is going to, uh, going to have sexual intercourse with Mother Earth to bring forth the Christ.
[01:40:39.411 --> 01:40:43.153]  That's what they believe!
[01:40:43.153 --> 01:40:43.373]  Hello?
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:48.068]  Did I knock you off your seat?
[01:40:48.068 --> 01:40:49.735]  No, no, it's... I mean, I'm listening.
[01:40:53.236 --> 01:40:53.517]  No, no, no.
[01:40:53.517 --> 01:40:54.858]  I mean, I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[01:40:54.858 --> 01:40:55.698]  I infiltrated it.
[01:40:55.698 --> 01:41:00.042]  And they address the owl as an owl, then as a bull, as Moloch.
[01:41:00.042 --> 01:41:01.743]  They address it as male and female.
[01:41:01.743 --> 01:41:03.905]  The owl is the female.
[01:41:03.905 --> 01:41:06.848]  And the cults are all a little bit different.
[01:41:06.848 --> 01:41:08.809]  And then the bull is the male.
[01:41:08.809 --> 01:41:16.576]  And they talk about how they sacrifice children and goodly tire, that's a quote, to the Moloch, the bull.
[01:41:16.576 --> 01:41:18.778]  But then they also address it as a female.
[01:41:18.778 --> 01:41:21.119]  And so they always see it as the horned god, the male.
[01:41:22.045 --> 01:41:25.208]  Yeah, you've got the core of it right there, Alex.
[01:41:25.208 --> 01:41:26.810]  But it's starting in Maury Strong country.
[01:41:43.877 --> 01:41:54.134]  And we've learned already we can't trust him, so you know that this religion, and they will get it through, you know, the Big Brother religion, they will
[01:41:55.086 --> 01:42:02.548]  Well, he's also on audio at huge elementary school conferences in the auditorium saying, tell your parents what to do.
[01:42:18.812 --> 01:42:20.492]  They don't know you're the boss.
[01:42:20.492 --> 01:42:26.994]  In the New York Times reports, they've got kids all over the country writing mock tickets to their parents for taking a hot bath.
[01:42:26.994 --> 01:42:27.894]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:42:27.894 --> 01:42:32.155]  They're going to train them to blow the whistle on their parents.
[01:42:32.155 --> 01:42:33.675]  Same thing that you read.
[01:42:33.675 --> 01:42:37.116]  I urge your listeners to reread 1984.
[01:42:37.116 --> 01:42:42.197]  There are a lot of parallels there.
[01:42:42.197 --> 01:42:43.557]  Including the earth religion.
[01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:45.038]  In 1984, they worshipped Big Brother.
[01:42:47.975 --> 01:42:51.877]  But in this case, it'll be Big Sister.
[01:42:51.877 --> 01:43:04.442]  Well, we have another article at JonesReport.com that's a scan from this Outside Magazine article, and it's got a photo of David the Rothschild wearing a skull and bones belt.
[01:43:04.442 --> 01:43:08.244]  It says he's Jesus, but he's also wearing a skull and crossbones belt.
[01:43:08.244 --> 01:43:08.804]  What do you think of that?
[01:43:09.821 --> 01:43:15.145]  Well, as a Christian, I would immediately be repulsed by it.
[01:43:15.145 --> 01:43:18.988]  I don't know what he was saying to the public.
[01:43:18.988 --> 01:43:25.974]  I didn't know if he was mocking Jesus Christ like some of the Orthodox Jews do.
[01:43:25.974 --> 01:43:34.981]  But the gist is that they're out to capture the minds of people.
[01:43:34.981 --> 01:43:37.183]  This is a mind game that we're involved in.
[01:43:38.405 --> 01:43:43.110]  Infowars.
[01:43:43.110 --> 01:43:52.979]  Giving up their rights to the state, but in this case to Gaia, Mother Earth, and they'll be rewarded for it.
[01:43:52.979 --> 01:43:55.722]  They'll get a razor blade, uh, uh,
[01:43:56.283 --> 01:43:57.624]  By the way, I've...
[01:44:18.223 --> 01:44:26.329]  Well, going back to what you just said, the BBC this weekend had a headline, that I showed people yesterday, where they said, rationing is needed.
[01:44:26.329 --> 01:44:36.678]  A credit ration on your card, like you said 20 years ago, that they said, now they're openly proposing, you'll have a card, and it has your rations on it, for everyone, for the Earth.
[01:44:36.678 --> 01:44:40.781]  Every can of corn or beans will have a tax on it as well.
[01:44:40.781 --> 01:44:45.264]  But even if you have the money to buy it, you won't get it when your carbon credits run out.
[01:44:45.264 --> 01:44:46.585]  I mean, this is neo-feudalism.
[01:44:46.585 --> 01:44:47.266]  This is serfdom.
[01:44:48.103 --> 01:44:48.964]  That's right.
[01:44:48.964 --> 01:44:56.373]  They're going to tax each can of beans or corn or whatever you have.
[01:44:56.373 --> 01:45:02.781]  They're going to determine how much of Mother Earth went into the growth of this product.
[01:45:02.781 --> 01:45:05.645]  And they're going to add that to the cost of the product.
[01:45:07.569 --> 01:45:09.610]  As if life hurts life.
[01:45:09.610 --> 01:45:14.812]  The whole process of life and death and regeneration of food is what the life cycle is.
[01:45:14.812 --> 01:45:23.255]  By taxing carbon dioxide that plants breathe, that all animals exhale, they can corner the entire life cycle.
[01:45:23.255 --> 01:45:25.736]  Yes, that's what they say.
[01:45:25.736 --> 01:45:36.780]  In fact, Rothschild said that he wanted to capture all of the carbon dioxide, turn it into dry ice, and ship the dry ice to the polar caps to keep them from melting.
[01:45:38.726 --> 01:45:40.147]  That's how he's going to take care of it.
[01:45:40.147 --> 01:45:42.149]  And of course he would make the money off of doing that.
[01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:44.731]  Excuse me, go ahead.
[01:45:44.731 --> 01:45:50.016]  And of course he would make the money off of that, like Bill Gates patenting all this stuff to stop carbon dioxide.
[01:45:50.016 --> 01:45:55.460]  Oh yeah, it would take a lot of dry ice to keep the polar caps from melting.
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:00.304]  What about Bill and Melinda Gates and their Eugenics Foundation?
[01:46:00.304 --> 01:46:01.045]  Do you ever run into that?
[01:46:01.758 --> 01:46:03.879]  No, I have the Gates Foundation.
[01:46:03.879 --> 01:46:05.260]  No, I haven't run it.
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:11.263]  I think it's a specific, it's a passive organization that Bill Gates has.
[01:46:11.263 --> 01:46:15.305]  He doesn't seem like he's a killer or anything like that.
[01:46:15.305 --> 01:46:17.367]  Well, we've done research on it.
[01:46:17.367 --> 01:46:19.808]  It's carefully guarded and we've had some internal whistleblowers.
[01:46:19.808 --> 01:46:28.693]  I mean, you know his dad was the former head of Planned Parenthood and he is for population reduction and he's busy inoculating little children.
[01:46:30.407 --> 01:46:32.069]  Oh, didn't know that.
[01:46:51.775 --> 01:46:58.377]  Not to the spiritual part, but just keep on going and maybe I can add some things to your talk.
[01:46:58.377 --> 01:47:00.278]  Okay, you sent me 19 clips.
[01:47:00.278 --> 01:47:11.641]  We can play any of these clips you want, but I'm going to go ahead and play Maury Strong, Banking Principles, because it all sounds slick and sweet and loving, but you can break down what he really means by that.
[01:47:11.641 --> 01:47:16.163]  And now 27 years later, we can see it's all been proven you were correct in what you got from this.
[01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:18.964]  But here's Maury Strong that you recorded at one of the meetings.
[01:47:18.964 --> 01:47:19.364]  Here it is.
[01:47:20.427 --> 01:47:32.392]  Now, all I'm saying, really, is that there are many areas in which it is possible to apply banking principles.
[01:47:32.392 --> 01:47:34.593]  Michael Sweetman is a banker.
[01:47:34.593 --> 01:47:37.374]  He's run major banking organizations.
[01:47:37.374 --> 01:47:46.838]  And when he proposed this idea, he'll have to talk for himself, but my understanding of it was that it was meant to tap new sources of funding.
[01:47:47.498 --> 01:47:50.180]  Okay, now we see that today.
[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:58.826]  Later in clips, they talk about every corporation and company having to give money to this bank that will then save the environment.
[01:47:58.826 --> 01:48:00.747]  Comments on that, George Hunt?
[01:48:17.793 --> 01:48:20.556]  Would you repeat that question, Alex?
[01:48:20.556 --> 01:48:22.098]  Can we turn our audio up to you?
[01:48:22.098 --> 01:48:30.388]  I was saying, in these clips, they're talking about banking principles.
[01:48:30.388 --> 01:48:31.189]  Comments on that?
[01:48:33.062 --> 01:48:40.084]  I think if I played the first clip for you, it would make it clearer to your audience.
[01:48:40.084 --> 01:48:41.725]  Okay, let's play clip number one.
[01:48:41.725 --> 01:48:44.245]  Michael Sweetman introduces the bank.
[01:48:44.245 --> 01:48:46.446]  Yeah, there might be more in there for you.
[01:48:46.446 --> 01:48:47.666]  Okay, okay.
[01:48:47.666 --> 01:48:49.047]  Here's that clip.
[01:48:49.047 --> 01:48:55.489]  One of the people probably still coming in, but I agree I need to get on with the agenda.
[01:48:55.489 --> 01:48:55.969]  I'm going to
[01:48:57.597 --> 01:49:06.864]  I'm going to ask Morris Strong to open the session with some remarks, and then I'm going to ask him to introduce Mr. Rothschild, on my left.
[01:49:06.864 --> 01:49:20.075]  And following some remarks from Mr. Rothschild, briefly set the scene, and then we're going to open it to the floor and see if we can get some dialogue and get some responses and questions and some ideas from you.
[01:49:20.075 --> 01:49:21.216]  We'll take it from there.
[01:49:21.216 --> 01:49:22.316]  We've got three days.
[01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:27.558]  We've got various topics we're dealing with, as the program indicates.
[01:49:27.558 --> 01:49:32.421]  We've got some very good people on these panels, and they've come a long way, some of them, to be here.
[01:49:32.421 --> 01:49:36.963]  And I really appreciate that, because they clearly indicate an interest.
[01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:45.534]  And I think we're going to have a very interesting time over the next three days.
[01:49:45.534 --> 01:49:47.075]  But not just an interesting time.
[01:49:47.075 --> 01:49:50.397]  I hope we're going to have a very productive time over the next three days.
[01:49:50.397 --> 01:50:01.285]  And we're going to come out by tomorrow night, at any rate, with a resolution which we have to hand to the Resolutions Committee, if we want a resolution about the World Conservation Bank in the Congress proceedings.
[01:50:01.285 --> 01:50:02.546]  And I hope, I trust that we do.
[01:50:02.546 --> 01:50:04.827]  So we've got to think about that as well.
[01:50:05.808 --> 01:50:11.112]  I suggest what we might do is to cover that at the end of these two sessions this afternoon.
[01:50:11.112 --> 01:50:13.093]  And maybe some... Alex, can you hear me?
[01:50:13.093 --> 01:50:18.758]  If I may, I'd like to stay back and we could discuss how we proceed with that.
[01:50:18.758 --> 01:50:20.119]  Yes, George, I could hear you.
[01:50:20.119 --> 01:50:22.240]  We were finishing the clip you sent us.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.042]  We're going to break, but... It was kind of long.
[01:50:24.042 --> 01:50:24.582]  I'm sorry.
[01:50:24.582 --> 01:50:25.303]  No, it's fine.
[01:50:25.303 --> 01:50:25.783]  It's good.
[01:50:25.783 --> 01:50:26.944]  It's great.
[01:50:26.944 --> 01:50:27.985]  Let me introduce the bank.
[01:50:27.985 --> 01:50:32.488]  Did you hear that we have to present this tomorrow?
[01:50:33.419 --> 01:50:37.823]  And so we've convened here with you to get your ideas towards this bank.
[01:50:37.823 --> 01:50:40.026]  It was a con job.
[01:50:40.026 --> 01:50:49.155]  Sure, I mean the UN always has its plan already set and then they just have a meeting with some of the elitist and then it's already been ratified.
[01:50:49.155 --> 01:50:49.535]  Stay there.
[01:50:49.535 --> 01:50:51.437]  We're going to come back and go over more of this.
[01:50:51.437 --> 01:50:53.759]  Got a bunch of clips coming up.
[01:50:53.759 --> 01:50:54.180]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:02.654]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.654 --> 01:51:08.236]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.236 --> 01:51:13.258]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.258 --> 01:51:18.279]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.826 --> 01:51:24.048]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.048 --> 01:51:26.368]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:26.368 --> 01:51:31.170]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.170 --> 01:51:32.290]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.290 --> 01:51:35.351]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.351 --> 01:51:38.632]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.972 --> 01:51:42.156]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.156 --> 01:51:44.378]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.378 --> 01:51:45.319]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.319 --> 01:51:45.519]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.519 --> 01:51:48.963]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.963 --> 01:51:50.705]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.713 --> 01:52:03.874]  Is your computer running slowly?

[01:54:19.592 --> 01:54:29.816]  We have George Hunt, who ended up in some of these meetings, high-level elite meetings by a twist of fate, and started investigating them, going to some of the sub-meetings over the years.
[01:54:29.816 --> 01:54:31.057]  He is with us today.
[01:54:32.128 --> 01:54:32.408]  Yes, he's a...
[01:54:56.511 --> 01:55:00.095]  International banker from Montreal, Canada.
[01:55:00.095 --> 01:55:05.301]  He's a close friend of Michael Tweetman, the president of the World Conservation Bank.
[01:55:05.301 --> 01:55:07.184]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[01:55:07.184 --> 01:55:08.685]  Yeah, this is what he had to say about us.
[01:55:08.685 --> 01:55:10.047]  Here it is.
[01:55:10.047 --> 01:55:13.010]  This looks like David Lang from Montreal.
[01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:14.933]  He's always full of, he's always full of awkward questions.
[01:55:15.928 --> 01:55:28.917]  Until recently, on the balance sheet, there were billions of dollars still listed as existing, which have now been written off, and so those surpluses have a bad habit of disappearing when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet.
[01:55:28.917 --> 01:55:33.260]  I suggest, therefore, that this be sold not through a democratic process.
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:41.546]  That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, which populates the Earth.
[01:55:41.546 --> 01:55:43.368]  We have to take almost an elitist program
[01:55:44.150 --> 01:56:00.661]  That we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future, in time frames and in results, which are not easily understood or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.
[01:56:00.661 --> 01:56:03.723]  That's an amazing statement, George Hunt.
[01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:05.844]  Yes, it's amazing, alright.
[01:56:05.844 --> 01:56:11.908]  It turned my gut and that's why I'm talking to you today, Alex.
[01:56:11.908 --> 01:56:13.429]  It just offended me so much.
[01:56:13.854 --> 01:56:26.645]  We're the cannon fodder that are unfortunately on the earth, and they're talking about billions of dollars they already had in their banking system, and talking about our property as if it was already theirs, and how they were going to get it.
[01:56:26.645 --> 01:56:27.746]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:27.746 --> 01:56:38.915]  And they're eliminating population all the time, through AIDS, through mercenary armies,
[01:56:39.799 --> 01:56:40.400]  I don't
[01:56:59.902 --> 01:57:16.314]  We have to get Cheney up to the bar, to the Justice Bar, and find out why Halliburton hired these Blackguard people that are killing citizens.
[01:57:16.314 --> 01:57:17.976]  It's all over.
[01:57:17.976 --> 01:57:20.618]  It's all through our society.
[01:57:20.618 --> 01:57:22.439]  We can't stop our government either.
[01:57:22.439 --> 01:57:23.660]  They just keep on killing.
[01:57:26.479 --> 01:57:33.444]  Well, we do have State Department Memorandum 200, where in 73, secretly to the CIA, it was U.S.
[01:57:33.444 --> 01:57:41.089]  government policy to use IMF and World Bank loans to force third-world populations to reduce their population by at least 50%.
[01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:44.612]  Yes, that kind of stuff.
[01:57:44.612 --> 01:57:46.493]  That goes on all the time, I guess.
[01:57:48.573 --> 01:57:49.034]  Amazing.
[01:57:49.034 --> 01:57:52.859]  There are so many other clips here to play of 19.
[01:57:52.859 --> 01:57:54.822]  What should we play next, George Hunt?
[01:57:54.822 --> 01:57:55.423]  Number 10.
[01:57:55.423 --> 01:57:56.805]  I think number 10 would be good.
[01:57:57.256 --> 01:58:00.319]  Okay, Rothschild elaborates.
[01:58:00.319 --> 01:58:00.939]  Well, you know what?
[01:58:00.939 --> 01:58:06.844]  We're going to go to break in a moment, come back in the next hour, and we'll play it when we come back after this 70-second break.
[01:58:06.844 --> 01:58:09.066]  And George Hunt will be with us for 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:58:09.066 --> 01:58:10.567]  This is too important.
[01:58:10.567 --> 01:58:22.157]  We're going to continue playing these clips, and then specifically for George Hunt, specifically and only for him, on the subject of the phony environmental eugenics death plot movement,
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.001]  Calls to George Hunt will take four or five calls.
[01:58:26.001 --> 01:58:26.121]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:26.121 --> 01:58:26.201]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:26.201 --> 01:58:30.261]  And we are simulcasting the radio show in living color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:30.261 --> 01:58:31.902]  We'll be right back.

[01:59:54.213 --> 01:59:56.614]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.614 --> 01:59:59.375]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.891 --> 02:00:07.193]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.193 --> 02:00:08.976]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.976 --> 02:00:10.738]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.738 --> 02:00:12.300]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:13.082]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.857 --> 02:00:18.041]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.041 --> 02:00:22.965]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.965 --> 02:00:29.150]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour when George Hunt leaves us, I'm going to get into the latest on healthcare.
[02:00:29.150 --> 02:00:37.357]  The flu scam has now been completely exposed by the EU itself as a total fraud, and they admit these vaccines were dangerous and it was wrong.
[02:00:38.558 --> 02:00:45.723]  We're also going to get into the latest on Bankstergate with Timmy Geithner and all of his criminal activity and your phone calls.
[02:00:45.723 --> 02:00:58.511]  But George Hunt, inside whistleblower, who by a twist of fate wanted to get his son a job in conservation and literally one of the heads of the global government conference was sick.
[02:00:58.511 --> 02:01:05.096]  He called him and he said probably didn't thought it was somebody else from the conference calling and said, yeah, you can go and just walked right into this.
[02:01:05.856 --> 02:01:09.319]  And that's why it's important you go to government and non-governmental events.
[02:01:09.319 --> 02:01:11.480]  Weasel your way in, record it.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:15.604]  I mean, I went to a Smart Growth Conference in 1998 in Austin.
[02:01:15.604 --> 02:01:18.346]  They had 4,000 people there, mainly from counties and cities.
[02:01:19.855 --> 02:01:20.816]  Okay, so this next clip
[02:01:42.891 --> 02:01:47.754]  Uh, is Rothschild Elaborates, then we'll go through more of these clips and get George Hunt's take on it.
[02:01:47.754 --> 02:01:50.795]  Okay, Rothschild Elaborates will play this.
[02:01:50.795 --> 02:01:58.019]  To overcome the chilling, doom-laden prognostications of Dr. Irving Mintzer's greenhouse effect,
[02:01:59.073 --> 02:02:16.480]  Perhaps it could be possible to utilize CO2, carbon dioxide, one of its main causes, to manufacture dry ice, to maintain the polar caps and the actual temperature of the ice there, and maintain their present temperature.
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:37.990]  Innovative and modern technology, world waste material, collected and perhaps burnt in volcanic areas, or buried so deep in the earth, in the wilderness desert areas of the mid-Sahara, where nobody goes, or in the empty quarter in Arabia, or the Gobi Desert.
[02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:46.815]  But all these ideas and visions, some far-fetched, and above all, the continuation of this Congress
[02:02:47.939 --> 02:02:49.047]  Needs money.
[02:02:51.087 --> 02:02:54.469]  So they get to take over and ship dry ice.
[02:02:54.469 --> 02:02:55.750]  Imagine the money they'd make.
[02:02:55.750 --> 02:03:00.233]  Or they will control globally toxic waste being shipped to the Sahara.
[02:03:00.233 --> 02:03:01.994]  So they want to control waste management.
[02:03:01.994 --> 02:03:04.395]  They want to control private property.
[02:03:04.395 --> 02:03:13.901]  And they want to scare the public with far-fetched programs into accepting that the earth must be dying from carbon dioxide because look at all the money we're spending on it.
[02:03:13.901 --> 02:03:15.122]  It must be real.
[02:03:15.122 --> 02:03:19.225]  Is that an accurate breakdown of what he was really saying there, George Hunt?
[02:03:19.795 --> 02:03:47.923]  Yes, they're creating a demand for dry ice machines, shall we say, through their rhetoric, so that the people will become fearful of Mother Earth crumbling, and they'll give in, then, to all of these monstrous projects that will cost trillions of dollars, and the elite will be in the front end of these projects, maybe as the
[02:03:48.519 --> 02:03:56.226]  The first investors and it will grow into a huge monster and then it'll collapse.
[02:03:56.226 --> 02:04:04.434]  And the elite will have pulled themselves out of the of this project before it collapses.
[02:04:04.434 --> 02:04:12.522]  So you're going to see a lot of these ideas coming along that will change the climate.
[02:04:16.036 --> 02:04:17.916]  That was another point, and we're going to go to break.
[02:04:17.916 --> 02:04:20.417]  Long segment coming up and play clip after clip.
[02:04:20.417 --> 02:04:22.318]  But clearly it's now declassified.
[02:04:22.318 --> 02:04:23.238]  They have weather weapons.
[02:04:23.238 --> 02:04:25.559]  They can create, control hurricanes.
[02:04:25.559 --> 02:04:26.959]  That's all declassified.
[02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:35.802]  We know the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, who's called for global extermination, drugging the water to sterilize us in his own book, Ecoscience.
[02:04:36.562 --> 02:04:42.665]  We know that they're already manipulating the weather to create calamities to scare people into submission.
[02:04:42.665 --> 02:04:43.665]  George Hunt, stay there.
[02:04:43.665 --> 02:04:48.527]  I'm going to come back and get your take on that on the other side of this quick break.
[02:04:48.527 --> 02:04:56.270]  And then we're going to play clip after clip and get quick comments from you about what Rothschild, Strong, and others are saying.
[02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:59.231]  They talk about international communism being introduced.
[02:04:59.231 --> 02:05:00.792]  This is incredible info.
[02:05:01.092 --> 02:05:05.634]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.634 --> 02:05:06.555]  Number 1.
[02:05:06.555 --> 02:05:09.976]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.976 --> 02:05:10.836]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:15.719]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.719 --> 02:05:16.459]  It's true.
[02:05:16.459 --> 02:05:21.341]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.341 --> 02:05:22.162]  Number 3.
[02:05:22.162 --> 02:05:25.743]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.743 --> 02:05:29.465]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.665 --> 02:05:30.446]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.446 --> 02:05:33.228]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:33.228 --> 02:05:36.890]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:37.691]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.691 --> 02:05:41.834]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.834 --> 02:05:46.597]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.877 --> 02:05:51.062]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:51.062 --> 02:05:52.844]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:52.844 --> 02:05:55.107]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:05:55.107 --> 02:05:57.450]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:01.547 --> 02:06:04.568]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.568 --> 02:06:09.891]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.891 --> 02:06:11.932]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.932 --> 02:06:16.934]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.934 --> 02:06:18.115]  How much do you want?
[02:06:18.115 --> 02:06:19.255]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.255 --> 02:06:21.136]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:21.136 --> 02:06:22.197]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.197 --> 02:06:24.398]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.398 --> 02:06:25.758]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.758 --> 02:06:27.059]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.259 --> 02:06:32.525]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.525 --> 02:06:36.130]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:36.130 --> 02:06:39.934]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.934 --> 02:06:41.175]  How much will you need?
[02:06:41.175 --> 02:06:42.077]  We don't know.
[02:06:42.077 --> 02:06:43.178]  How much do you want?
[02:06:43.178 --> 02:06:44.119]  All you can get.
[02:06:44.119 --> 02:06:44.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:48.244]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:07:36.896 --> 02:07:44.061]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[02:07:50.064 --> 02:07:50.384]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.675 --> 02:08:11.198]  mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:08:11.198 --> 02:08:12.780]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:13.681]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.681 --> 02:08:18.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.525 --> 02:08:23.529]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:31.216]  Eight minutes into hour number three, George Hunt was just talking about how they declassified weather manipulation, weather control systems.
[02:08:32.257 --> 02:08:37.961]  And how they can clearly use this to create calamities and then scare the population into submission.
[02:08:37.961 --> 02:08:40.782]  That's been one of my biggest concerns.
[02:08:40.782 --> 02:08:41.923]  Going back to George Hunt.
[02:08:41.923 --> 02:08:44.084]  George, your take on that?
[02:08:44.084 --> 02:08:53.510]  Well, um... The, um... The concern that I have is the E-bomb.
[02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:58.713]  The, uh, so-called, uh... Surge bomb?
[02:08:58.713 --> 02:09:00.374]  Electromagnetic pulse weapon.
[02:09:01.388 --> 02:09:03.309]  Yes, you got it.
[02:09:03.309 --> 02:09:22.257]  That thing would be easy for any little state like North Korea or Iran or Israel to send a rocket bearing an atomic bomb up in the sky about 300 miles, exploding it and wiping out all of the electricity in line of sight of that explosion.
[02:09:22.257 --> 02:09:23.437]  That's the thing that bothers me.
[02:09:23.437 --> 02:09:25.938]  You think the globalists would go that far?
[02:09:25.938 --> 02:09:27.299]  Oh yes.
[02:09:27.299 --> 02:09:30.500]  David Rockefeller has stated, and I checked it on the
[02:09:31.167 --> 02:09:39.793]  On the internet last night, that the world order will not be established until a terrible catastrophe occurs.
[02:09:39.793 --> 02:09:41.414]  Yeah, they all say that continually.
[02:09:41.414 --> 02:09:46.218]  He actually said that in the Council on Foreign Relations publication, Foreign Affairs.
[02:09:46.218 --> 02:09:49.160]  That's part of their fear doctrine, huh?
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:50.040]  Maybe.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:52.962]  Do you want to continue along that line or go to some more clips?
[02:09:52.962 --> 02:09:55.064]  Well, I'd like to follow the line.
[02:09:55.064 --> 02:09:56.104]  Let's go to some clips.
[02:09:56.104 --> 02:09:59.267]  Let's have Maury Strong, number 7.
[02:10:01.088 --> 02:10:04.353]  Okay, Maury Strong announces Rothschild.
[02:10:04.353 --> 02:10:07.036]  Then I want to get to Rothschild talking about communism.
[02:10:07.036 --> 02:10:10.240]  Okay, here's Maury Strong.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:11.342]  Let's play seven first.
[02:10:11.342 --> 02:10:12.023]  Let's go through these.
[02:10:12.023 --> 02:10:12.463]  Here's seven.
[02:10:13.211 --> 02:10:15.412]  There is no better person.
[02:10:15.412 --> 02:10:26.076]  He epitomizes in his own life that positive synthesis between environment conservation on the one hand and economics on the other.
[02:10:26.076 --> 02:10:33.599]  And I'm just delighted to have this opportunity of introducing to you Edmund de Rothschild.
[02:10:33.599 --> 02:10:36.460]  Now I want to go ahead now and go to clip number
[02:10:38.045 --> 02:10:38.245]  13.
[02:10:38.245 --> 02:10:42.349]  I want to play the World Collective again, then some new clips, 14 and others.
[02:10:42.349 --> 02:10:44.751]  Here's 13 with Rothschild.
[02:10:44.751 --> 02:11:02.968]  By thinking forward as to how to reach out to the public at large, to every corporate entity throughout the world, to put aside, hopefully tax-free, a part of their profits to fund our ecological and environmental protection.
[02:11:04.577 --> 02:11:07.079]  So, tax-free paid to his bank.
[02:11:07.079 --> 02:11:08.721]  I have Reuters right here.
[02:11:08.721 --> 02:11:11.944]  Twenty-something years later, here it is happening.
[02:11:11.944 --> 02:11:15.567]  Giving them money, and then they're tax-free to use it.
[02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:16.488]  That's it.
[02:11:16.488 --> 02:11:26.076]  I didn't know that occurred, but I saw the banks tumbling down, and as the banks tumble, they're tumbling to the house of Rothschild.
[02:11:26.076 --> 02:11:29.940]  Now, on the last clip you played, or the one before that,
[02:11:30.356 --> 02:11:42.085]  Did you hear Maury Strong announce him as the positive synthesis between conservation on one side and growth and development on the other?
[02:11:42.085 --> 02:11:50.811]  He is the result of, he controls, in other words, the conservation movement and the economic movement.
[02:11:50.811 --> 02:11:52.392]  Rothschild's got it all.
[02:11:52.392 --> 02:11:54.854]  Well, I've seen all the big Rothschilds out of England.
[02:11:56.485 --> 02:12:01.630]  The two heads of it, openly writing articles, giving speeches, calling for global governance.
[02:12:01.630 --> 02:12:05.313]  We'll play a clip from Bloomberg here in Copenhagen coming up.
[02:12:05.313 --> 02:12:08.436]  Let's go ahead now and go to clip number 14.
[02:12:08.436 --> 02:12:12.599]  Rothschild, Lord Rothschild, international communism introduced.
[02:12:12.599 --> 02:12:13.960]  Here's that clip.
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:22.228]  Ladies and gentlemen, every country has its own problems, its indigenous peoples and its wildlife.
[02:12:23.206 --> 02:12:30.510]  This International Conservation Bank must know no frontiers, no boundaries.
[02:12:30.510 --> 02:12:42.196]  Its funds must be used constructively and not, and not to be challenged into greedy hands or weapons of destruction.
[02:12:42.196 --> 02:12:50.100]  So here are these people always financing revolutions and wars and weapons systems and you call that communism introduced.
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:50.801]  Why do you say that?
[02:12:51.667 --> 02:13:03.192]  Yes, in other words, the currency will be used as a communal device, because there will be one world currency.
[02:13:03.192 --> 02:13:20.920]  And he's saying, too, as I recall in speech, that each country also has its own indigenous people, and they'll be allowed to have soft currencies, but the currencies will be intermingled
[02:13:21.850 --> 02:13:27.012]  Yeah, you're going to have a global currency over the regionals, which they're now setting up.
[02:13:27.012 --> 02:13:32.294]  It's amazing, 23 years later, to see all of this actually unfolding.
[02:13:32.294 --> 02:13:44.058]  And also, Ban Ki-moon, a month and a half ago in the New York Times, Secretary General of the UN, he said all nations will be forced to pay into the UN to fund this.
[02:13:44.058 --> 02:13:46.418]  Let's play clip number 15.
[02:13:46.418 --> 02:13:47.639]  Rothschild brags.
[02:13:47.639 --> 02:13:48.019]  Here it is.
[02:13:52.552 --> 02:13:57.195]  If there are any Japanese in the audience, I would apologize to them.
[02:13:57.195 --> 02:14:11.642]  But I've had very great experience in Japan since my family has had connections with them since 1865 after Perry opened them up in 1863.
[02:14:11.642 --> 02:14:13.684]  Let's play another clip.
[02:14:13.684 --> 02:14:18.326]  Let's have Michael Sweetman James Baker quote clip number 16.
[02:14:18.326 --> 02:14:21.228]  Here's Michael Sweetman James Baker quote.
[02:14:21.228 --> 02:14:21.668]  Here it is.
[02:14:22.119 --> 02:14:24.101]  At his keynote address to this Congress, U.S.
[02:14:24.101 --> 02:14:32.987]  Treasury Secretary James A. Baker pointed to the, I quote, the underlying reality that sound conservation is good economics.
[02:14:32.987 --> 02:14:37.190]  And further, conservation should not be the enemy of prosperity.
[02:14:37.190 --> 02:14:41.073]  It should instead sustain and enrich our prosperity.
[02:14:41.073 --> 02:14:43.855]  Unquote.
[02:14:43.855 --> 02:14:48.118]  How do you decipher that, decode that, George Hunt?
[02:14:48.118 --> 02:14:50.660]  Well, I couldn't hear him very well on that.
[02:14:53.313 --> 02:14:59.857]  I have to beg... Yeah, I think that's part of the problem today, as you're having trouble hearing.
[02:14:59.857 --> 02:15:02.838]  That was the James Baker quote by Michael Sweetman?
[02:15:02.838 --> 02:15:04.920]  Oh, yes.
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:15.266]  I set that up for you to play because James Baker made a remark that caused the conservationists to tremble at the beginning of the meeting.
[02:15:15.266 --> 02:15:21.450]  He gave the keynote address, and he said that conservation required growth and development.
[02:15:22.586 --> 02:15:24.627]  And the conservation said, what?
[02:15:24.627 --> 02:15:26.908]  You could hear the murmur in the audience.
[02:15:26.908 --> 02:15:39.073]  Well, what that means is that Rothschild, in order to be the positive synthesis of growth and development and economics, has to have a dynamic going.
[02:15:39.073 --> 02:15:49.237]  It has to be a forceful opposition in order for his group to go in and pick up the pieces and take over control.
[02:15:50.023 --> 02:16:00.910]  So he's encouraging this war between conservation and development and he is the synthesis of all the stuff that'll come out of the war.
[02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:11.577]  Now for those that missed it, I want to play banker David Lang talking about their elitist program and how to deal with the cannon fodder one more time and then two final clips we haven't played yet.
[02:16:11.577 --> 02:16:13.298]  Play clip 17.
[02:16:13.298 --> 02:16:14.559]  It's so chilling.
[02:16:14.559 --> 02:16:16.040]  Here is clip 17.
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:17.101]  David Lang from Montreal.
[02:16:18.502 --> 02:16:21.424]  He's always full of, he's always full of awkward questions, Mr. Chairman.
[02:16:21.424 --> 02:16:34.415]  Until recently, on the balance sheet, there were billions of dollars still listed as existing, which have now been written off, and so those surpluses have a bad habit of disappearing when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet.
[02:16:34.415 --> 02:16:38.759]  I suggest, therefore, that this be sold not through a democratic process.
[02:16:38.759 --> 02:16:46.265]  That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, which populates the Earth.
[02:16:47.034 --> 02:17:05.663]  We have to take almost an elitist program that we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.
[02:17:05.663 --> 02:17:07.484]  Okay, George Hunt.
[02:17:07.484 --> 02:17:13.647]  George, I want to ask you about this Maharaja clip where he questions Michael Sweetman's words.
[02:17:13.647 --> 02:17:16.409]  We're going to play this clip and then get you to comment on that, okay?
[02:17:18.226 --> 02:17:18.907]  All right, good.
[02:17:18.907 --> 02:17:22.569]  Here is the Maharaja Questions Michael Sweetman's Words.
[02:17:22.569 --> 02:17:23.670]  Here it is.
[02:17:23.670 --> 02:17:25.971]  I'll be very brief.
[02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:35.758]  I've been listening patiently to Michael Sweetman's paper and the discussion so far.
[02:17:35.758 --> 02:17:43.944]  I'm confused, particularly since I am the president of the World Wildlife Fund India, an NGO.
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:52.486]  of the need of another helping hand.
[02:17:52.486 --> 02:18:12.442]  But since this baby has been accidentally conceived by Michael Swetman, and I presume that he's either a very foolish man or a very clever man.
[02:18:12.442 --> 02:18:13.703]  I think he's a very clever man.
[02:18:14.844 --> 02:18:17.445]  Because the paper does not give any details.
[02:18:17.445 --> 02:18:20.486]  It's very general.
[02:18:20.486 --> 02:18:35.113]  Well, so Maharajah's pointing out this gives a blank check of power to this World Conference Congress instead of the World Wildlife Fund set up by the Nazi Prince Bernhard to carry out extermination.
[02:18:35.113 --> 02:18:37.834]  What's going on in that clip with the Maharajah?
[02:18:37.834 --> 02:18:42.876]  Well, the Maharajah saw the light.
[02:18:42.876 --> 02:18:44.377]  He saw that
[02:18:45.077 --> 02:18:57.143]  Either it was a very foolish plan that Michael Sweetland was introducing, you know, to save the world's conservation, or it was a clever plan.
[02:18:57.143 --> 02:19:04.286]  And he didn't identify why it was clever, but he said, but I believe it's a clever plan.
[02:19:04.286 --> 02:19:12.070]  It's a clever plan because it seems to appear that they are saving conservation.
[02:19:13.141 --> 02:19:16.862]  And I think that's what the Maharajah saw.
[02:19:16.862 --> 02:19:23.223]  They were going to get money out of it instead of nice pretty new trees.
[02:19:23.223 --> 02:19:24.623]  It's a clever plan.
[02:19:24.623 --> 02:19:29.064]  And everyone laughs because they understand that of course it's a joke.
[02:19:29.064 --> 02:19:33.985]  That's why they're there is to get their hands on property and control the world population.
[02:19:33.985 --> 02:19:37.025]  So he's stating the obvious.
[02:19:37.025 --> 02:19:40.226]  I asked him as an official host, when is this bank going to
[02:19:41.547 --> 02:19:41.867]  Stay there.
[02:19:41.867 --> 02:19:43.770]  This is incredible bombshell info.
[02:19:43.770 --> 02:19:44.150]  Stay with us.
[02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.410]  Amazing.
[02:20:01.533 --> 02:20:05.074]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:20:05.074 --> 02:20:07.355]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:20:07.355 --> 02:20:08.235]  Don't!
[02:20:08.235 --> 02:20:11.677]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:11.677 --> 02:20:20.760]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:24.421]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:20:24.821 --> 02:20:27.963]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:20:27.963 --> 02:20:35.346]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:20:35.346 --> 02:20:36.527]  Herb K was right.
[02:20:36.527 --> 02:20:39.708]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:39.708 --> 02:20:41.069]  What have you got to lose?
[02:20:41.069 --> 02:20:44.771]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:20:44.771 --> 02:20:48.713]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:20:48.713 --> 02:20:48.993]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:20:53.155 --> 02:20:53.576]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:20:53.576 --> 02:20:53.636]  888-352-7726.
[02:20:53.636 --> 02:20:56.698]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:20:56.698 --> 02:20:59.060]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:03.063]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:12.290 --> 02:21:14.872]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.872 --> 02:21:21.278]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:21.278 --> 02:21:26.342]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:26.342 --> 02:21:36.450]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:36.570 --> 02:21:38.912]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.912 --> 02:21:40.514]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:40.514 --> 02:21:42.956]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.956 --> 02:21:45.078]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:45.078 --> 02:21:50.222]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:50.222 --> 02:21:55.247]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:55.247 --> 02:21:59.431]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:01.331 --> 02:22:07.656]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[02:22:07.656 --> 02:22:12.619]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[02:22:12.619 --> 02:22:16.682]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[02:22:16.682 --> 02:22:18.023]  Let's put this another way.
[02:22:18.023 --> 02:22:23.387]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[02:22:23.387 --> 02:22:26.289]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[02:22:26.289 --> 02:22:28.951]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[02:22:28.951 --> 02:22:30.332]  You can possess it in your hand.
[02:22:30.652 --> 02:22:31.912]  You can take it with you.
[02:22:31.912 --> 02:22:33.393]  Gold is real money.
[02:22:33.393 --> 02:22:34.753]  Gold is honest money.
[02:22:34.753 --> 02:22:37.474]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:37.474 --> 02:22:44.735]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[02:22:44.735 --> 02:22:45.876]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[02:22:45.876 --> 02:22:46.636]  800-686-2237, extension 134.
[02:23:01.383 --> 02:23:10.088]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:23:10.088 --> 02:23:16.072]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[02:23:16.072 --> 02:23:22.616]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.

[02:23:56.052 --> 02:23:56.993]  Is it getting better?
[02:24:17.877 --> 02:24:30.500]  Alright, I'm going to go ahead and just keep George Hutchell for the after so I can go to Mike, Herman, Terry, Ben and a couple others.
[02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:34.865]  But he just dropped another big bombshell.
[02:24:34.865 --> 02:24:46.794]  Studying the UN zone documents, studying the IMF World Bank, the banks want to get everybody in debt, all the nations, all the sub-states within the nations bankrupted to then make you dependent on them.
[02:24:46.794 --> 02:24:53.740]  And then under environmental rules, grab and snatch property and raise the taxes so you go bankrupt.
[02:24:53.740 --> 02:24:58.764]  Then they bring in a global regime, global rationing openly being announced.
[02:24:58.764 --> 02:24:59.705]  This is their plan.
[02:25:00.365 --> 02:25:02.127]  They're brainwashing your kids in school.
[02:25:02.127 --> 02:25:03.629]  They're really trying it.
[02:25:03.629 --> 02:25:05.952]  Copenhagen was a big blow against them.
[02:25:05.952 --> 02:25:08.495]  The fact that their scientists know it's a fraud.
[02:25:08.495 --> 02:25:12.540]  Ben Santer at the UN admitting that it's all, you know, made up.
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:19.388]  That they basically cut these sections out of the UN report where their own scientists said man wasn't causing global warming.
[02:25:20.049 --> 02:25:24.792]  Or they're covering up the fact for the last nine years the earth has been radically cooling.
[02:25:24.792 --> 02:25:26.532]  All of this.
[02:25:26.532 --> 02:25:37.158]  And then he's saying he's there talking to Rockefeller, talking to others, specifically tell that story, and they're saying they're going to bankrupt the world in 2012.
[02:25:37.158 --> 02:25:38.299]  This is in 1987.
[02:25:38.299 --> 02:25:44.022]  Everything George talked about, he put this out 15 years ago or more, has now come true.
[02:25:44.022 --> 02:25:46.343]  Really proving what he's saying.
[02:25:46.343 --> 02:25:48.384]  But specifically, take your time.
[02:25:48.724 --> 02:25:49.724]  Who said this again?
[02:25:49.724 --> 02:25:50.604]  Was it Rockefeller?
[02:25:50.604 --> 02:25:52.025]  I'm going from memory.
[02:25:52.025 --> 02:25:57.906]  At this conference, they said how they're going to do it and make the World Conservation Bank take over.
[02:25:57.906 --> 02:25:59.106]  Okay.
[02:25:59.106 --> 02:26:07.507]  It was the... You remember, I was there for three days asking lots of questions, okay?
[02:26:07.507 --> 02:26:17.229]  So, the questions evolved to, number one, the question I had was, how is this bank going to be funded?
[02:26:18.385 --> 02:26:47.920]  I learned through the guests there, maybe I went to McNeil of the United Nations, I don't know where, but I found out that the plan is, and this is hearsay, that the plan is that the bank is going to bankrupt in 2012, and that the elite that put money into the bank
[02:26:48.615 --> 02:27:11.553]  When it bankrupts, those elite people will go into the bank, take it over, and take over every mortgage, everything, all the accounts, all the credit cards, everything that people have, and the bank will then officially be in Rothschild's hands, where before it was surreptitiously in Rothschild's hands.
[02:27:12.022 --> 02:27:12.923]  Well, this is incredible.
[02:27:12.923 --> 02:27:21.668]  Let me stop you and I want you to elaborate, George Hunt, because now we see a small group of central banks bankrupting other banks by design to consolidate.
[02:27:21.668 --> 02:27:22.689]  That's in their own documents.
[02:27:22.689 --> 02:27:33.716]  We see the IMF and World Bank to be holding companies for the global tax money through what they did agree to at Copenhagen, and that's actually what they're now setting up.
[02:27:33.716 --> 02:27:38.579]  They're openly setting up what participants told you they were going to set up.
[02:27:38.579 --> 02:27:40.260]  Are they getting this position for 2012?
[02:27:42.042 --> 02:27:47.246]  That's where they're headed from my last information, Alex.
[02:27:47.246 --> 02:27:49.587]  They don't slow down on their plans.
[02:27:49.587 --> 02:27:51.148]  They don't defer them.
[02:27:51.148 --> 02:27:55.952]  They just eliminate the problem for their plans to go through.
[02:27:55.952 --> 02:27:59.014]  People like me, of course.
[02:27:59.014 --> 02:28:06.899]  So, yeah, I would say there's going to be a major currency splash in 2012.
[02:28:09.481 --> 02:28:11.702]  Or leading up to 2000.
[02:28:11.702 --> 02:28:12.943]  Or leading up to 2012.
[02:28:12.943 --> 02:28:15.525]  I mean, this is already happening.
[02:28:15.525 --> 02:28:26.291]  The globe is imploding by an engineered depression, and everything is falling to the house of Rothschild and Rockefeller, and every time they bust an oligarch in Russia, it turns out it was really owned by the Rothschilds.
[02:28:26.291 --> 02:28:27.912]  That's mainstream news.
[02:28:27.912 --> 02:28:28.833]  Well, yeah.
[02:28:28.833 --> 02:28:31.274]  Look at the news about Warren Buffett.
[02:28:31.274 --> 02:28:36.097]  He's accusing the Rothschild family of controlling the world gold market.
[02:28:36.733 --> 02:28:42.915]  He's probably right, because the Rothschilds set the price of gold twice a day in London.
[02:28:42.915 --> 02:28:45.555]  For the world.
[02:28:45.555 --> 02:28:47.396]  Unbelievable information.
[02:28:47.396 --> 02:28:54.638]  And again, when did you first start going public, releasing the videos of the conferences, releasing the audio, and saying all of this?
[02:28:54.638 --> 02:28:57.378]  Wasn't it like 20 years ago?
[02:28:57.378 --> 02:28:58.259]  Yes.
[02:28:58.259 --> 02:29:03.640]  It was in 1988 that a preacher named Charles Allendale
[02:29:04.093 --> 02:29:21.666]  Who had a radio station in Texas was accused of having me on and they said, look, if you have that guy George Hunt on again, you're going to lose your job.
[02:29:21.666 --> 02:29:25.329]  Well, he had me on again the next week because this is earth shattering news.
[02:29:25.979 --> 02:29:31.160]  Well, the station was immediately bought out, and Alan Dale lost his job.
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:32.740]  And that's the issue.
[02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:36.881]  20 years ago, 22 years ago, they could stop stuff.
[02:29:36.881 --> 02:29:38.101]  Now they can't.
[02:29:38.101 --> 02:29:39.161]  It's out in the open.
[02:29:39.161 --> 02:29:39.681]  Stay there.
[02:29:39.681 --> 02:29:42.062]  George Hunt, incredible information.
[02:29:42.062 --> 02:29:46.242]  The website is the, with a the in the front, bigbank.com.
[02:29:46.242 --> 02:29:50.103]  Our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:29:50.103 --> 02:29:52.163]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:52.163 --> 02:29:53.544]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.544 --> 02:29:55.064]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.079 --> 02:30:01.242]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.242 --> 02:30:05.785]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.785 --> 02:30:06.706]  Number one.
[02:30:06.706 --> 02:30:10.128]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.128 --> 02:30:10.989]  Number two.
[02:30:10.989 --> 02:30:15.872]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.872 --> 02:30:16.632]  It's true.
[02:30:16.632 --> 02:30:21.496]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.496 --> 02:30:21.956]  Number three.
[02:30:22.296 --> 02:30:25.899]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.899 --> 02:30:30.602]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.602 --> 02:30:33.364]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.364 --> 02:30:37.847]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.847 --> 02:30:41.990]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:46.754]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.034 --> 02:30:51.197]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.197 --> 02:30:52.979]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.979 --> 02:30:55.241]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:55.241 --> 02:30:57.582]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:02.861 --> 02:31:06.822]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.822 --> 02:31:15.684]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.684 --> 02:31:20.305]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.305 --> 02:31:31.147]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.767 --> 02:31:41.269]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.269 --> 02:31:46.711]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:46.711 --> 02:31:54.192]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:54.192 --> 02:31:56.933]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:02.122 --> 02:32:06.125]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:06.125 --> 02:32:09.368]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.368 --> 02:32:14.172]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:32:14.172 --> 02:32:20.578]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.578 --> 02:32:22.820]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:23.640]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:24.141]  Bernanke?
[02:32:24.141 --> 02:32:24.821]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:24.821 --> 02:32:26.102]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:26.102 --> 02:32:28.344]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.233 --> 02:32:49.518]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:49.518 --> 02:32:58.645]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:01.772 --> 02:33:09.526]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north and flush your soul
[02:33:14.197 --> 02:33:26.648]  Okay, final segment with George Hunt, and then I'm going to break down all the huge BankerGate news, what's happening with healthcare.
[02:33:26.648 --> 02:33:28.509]  It can be stopped.
[02:33:28.509 --> 02:33:31.011]  It looks like it's in conference right now.
[02:33:31.011 --> 02:33:35.815]  The flu fraud being fully exposed, but I want to go to calls, Mike Herman, Terry Benn.
[02:33:36.496 --> 02:33:49.125]  We're only taking calls specifically for George Hunt for your questions on this important issue of a global elite organizing the planet under the fraud of fake environmentalism to take your basic rights, your liberty, your property.
[02:33:49.125 --> 02:33:58.291]  And we played that clip yesterday of Australia where they're just grabbing all the farmer's land, literally in some areas all of it, and just saying it's off limits for carbon credits.
[02:33:58.291 --> 02:34:01.434]  You can't run cattle or sheep on your own land anymore.
[02:34:02.074 --> 02:34:07.580]  This is really happening and it's happening here and we've got to stop these people.
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:19.372]  When we got the SPP documents a few years ago from the North American Union meetings, it was the corporate leaders there running the government meetings with the bureaucracy saying we're going to tax and pay ourselves the carbon tax.
[02:34:19.372 --> 02:34:20.954]  The good news is this is in trouble.
[02:34:22.199 --> 02:34:26.201]  George Hunt, are you not excited to see Copenhagen exposed?
[02:34:26.201 --> 02:34:30.103]  You were talking about this 22 years ago and people, some of them, were laughing at you.
[02:34:30.103 --> 02:34:32.184]  Now it's all out in the open.
[02:34:32.184 --> 02:34:34.425]  Is that exciting you, George Hunt?
[02:34:34.425 --> 02:34:36.626]  Oh, it's exciting me so much.
[02:34:36.626 --> 02:34:38.547]  My name is George Washington Hunt.
[02:34:38.547 --> 02:34:49.272]  I was born on Columbus Day and I think that I have a mission to defeat these people, to help defeat these people.
[02:34:49.272 --> 02:34:50.993]  I had, when I was on the
[02:34:51.795 --> 02:34:58.017]  Jesse Ventura Show, I said to the camera, I think they're going to win it.
[02:34:58.017 --> 02:35:00.919]  And the reason was that they're smarter than us.
[02:35:00.919 --> 02:35:12.823]  But if you take our combined intelligence, like I'm hearing coming out of you, and you're hearing coming out of me, we can whip these guys so we can get the Americans to cooperate.
[02:35:12.823 --> 02:35:17.725]  Americans and others around the world just have to face their own documents, their own statements.
[02:35:17.725 --> 02:35:19.666]  I mean, in fact, I'll grab it, it's over here.
[02:35:22.310 --> 02:35:25.571]  I talk about this book every week on air, Ecoscience.
[02:35:25.571 --> 02:35:29.673]  I've scanned through the whole 1,100 pages, or whatever it is.
[02:35:29.673 --> 02:35:31.133]  Let me see how long it is.
[02:35:31.133 --> 02:35:33.034]  Yeah, the 1,100 pages.
[02:35:33.034 --> 02:35:39.857]  I've scanned through this, and it openly says, poison the water supply, sterilize us, cut off our resources, bankrupt us.
[02:35:39.857 --> 02:35:41.477]  This is the White House science czar.
[02:35:41.477 --> 02:35:43.638]  John P. Holdren wrote Ecoscience.
[02:35:43.638 --> 02:35:51.421]  I mean, there are literally thousands of white papers, books, publications, where they openly state what they're openly doing, and now this guy gives
[02:35:51.761 --> 02:35:58.723]  Press conferences, the White House Science Czar saying they've got a secret program already manipulating the weather.
[02:35:58.723 --> 02:35:59.504]  That's right.
[02:35:59.504 --> 02:36:19.831]  They've already, they dreamed up these plans as far as hundreds of years ago and the contemporary plans that we see where the banks are going down and so on is part of their plan that was conceived as far as I could see a hundred years ago.
[02:36:20.444 --> 02:36:29.572]  Okay, I want to go to calls, but first I want to play a few global governance clips for people that may have missed the last few of them, that have occurred in the last two months.
[02:36:29.572 --> 02:36:38.180]  Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU, openly calling for global governance, saying that the UN global carbon tax is the heart of world government.
[02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:39.721]  It's past the point of torture.
[02:36:53.697 --> 02:36:54.698]  In case you missed it,
[02:37:22.449 --> 02:37:25.011]  It's past the point of talking.
[02:37:25.011 --> 02:37:32.578]  We know historically that the global governance sort of agenda to these issues is very hard to try.
[02:37:32.578 --> 02:37:35.881]  So there he is saying the time for talk is over.
[02:37:35.881 --> 02:37:37.902]  That means you don't get any input.
[02:37:37.902 --> 02:37:38.663]  We're doing this.
[02:37:38.663 --> 02:37:40.164]  Well, we did get input.
[02:37:40.164 --> 02:37:41.806]  We did expose their fraud.
[02:37:41.806 --> 02:37:42.626]  They're in trouble.
[02:37:42.626 --> 02:37:43.127]  George Hunt.
[02:37:44.227 --> 02:37:52.312]  This whole global carbon tax thing that's going on, I have to admit that I don't really understand it.
[02:37:52.312 --> 02:38:04.158]  But I do know that the House of Rothschild pushed it through the chairman of the House of Rothschild at a meeting of the London banks.
[02:38:04.158 --> 02:38:09.981]  That happened about six months ago when I picked up on that clip.
[02:38:09.981 --> 02:38:12.863]  This carbon tax, what do you know about it, Alex?
[02:38:14.295 --> 02:38:21.597]  Well, it's fully meant to tax and control all human activity to be selectively enforced, just like the health care plan.
[02:38:21.597 --> 02:38:25.238]  Some unions don't have to do it, but the rest of the public do.
[02:38:25.238 --> 02:38:30.720]  It's all selectively enforced, like Obama decided what car dealerships stayed open, what didn't.
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:34.201]  $3 billion, the $25 billion for the auto bailout paid to move
[02:38:34.881 --> 02:38:40.706]  Factories, on record, this is Associated Press, to Brazil, Eastern Europe, Russia, and China.
[02:38:40.706 --> 02:38:46.390]  So the globalists literally pay to have factories built for themselves.
[02:38:46.390 --> 02:38:57.619]  As Maury Strong said on TV in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro as the head of the UN Summit, it is our job to destroy industrial society in the West.
[02:38:57.619 --> 02:39:04.364]  Let's play this clip of Herman Van Rompuy in his acceptance speech as the new head of the EU calling for global governance.
[02:39:05.629 --> 02:39:13.411]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[02:39:13.411 --> 02:39:22.134]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[02:39:22.134 --> 02:39:31.136]  Our mission, our presidency, is one of hope, supported by acts and by deeds.
[02:39:31.136 --> 02:39:31.396]  Okay.
[02:39:32.722 --> 02:39:36.125]  Again, there's Herman Von Ruppe, we have Ban Ki-moon, Gordon Brown.
[02:39:36.125 --> 02:39:38.367]  Why are they coming out in the open now?
[02:39:38.367 --> 02:39:46.654]  Because we're approaching the 2011-12, which all the economists here say they believe is the time that everything's going to collapse.
[02:39:46.654 --> 02:39:49.876]  Are they getting us ready for global government?
[02:39:49.876 --> 02:39:57.482]  Oh yes, they're getting us ready for global government, even in the schools, intermediate schools, colleges.
[02:39:57.482 --> 02:40:01.666]  People are all whistling global government.
[02:40:03.682 --> 02:40:07.125]  It has infected our society already.
[02:40:07.125 --> 02:40:22.960]  They'll attract the people through the religious aspects of the government, through the promise of being able to buy or sell if you cooperate with the global government.
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:25.622]  If you don't cooperate, you won't be able to buy or sell.
[02:40:26.502 --> 02:40:33.588]  That's been prophesied in the Bible, and I think that we're headed for that very soon when we have only one bank.
[02:40:35.248 --> 02:40:37.669]  And they're openly saying that's their program.
[02:40:37.669 --> 02:40:46.052]  This global private banking government will decide if you can have a business, if you can have a factory, if you can have a job, if you can have your farm, you own.
[02:40:46.052 --> 02:40:51.374]  I mean, this is really happening with the Animal ID, the Primus Society, all of it.
[02:40:51.374 --> 02:40:52.375]  That's why it's so... It's all happening.
[02:40:52.375 --> 02:40:53.295]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:53.295 --> 02:41:00.958]  In the Copenhagen 50, the Eco 50, whatever it was called, the Copenhagen, if we had
[02:41:02.178 --> 02:41:14.746]  If we had gone to the line and signed that document, we would have been giving away our rights to how much hot water we can use per day, what kind of car we'll drive.
[02:41:14.746 --> 02:41:21.590]  We would have made ourselves as the same common person in the world.
[02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:25.853]  And here we are, a blessed country, and we give it all up through Copenhagen 15.
[02:41:26.912 --> 02:41:30.493]  It's not enough for these bankers to rob and loot and run their scams.
[02:41:30.493 --> 02:41:34.234]  They want to shut off our resources to make us completely dependent on them.
[02:41:34.234 --> 02:41:35.955]  We're going to calls now.
[02:41:35.955 --> 02:41:39.216]  I want to encourage everybody to go to TheBigBadBank.com.
[02:41:39.216 --> 02:41:41.436]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[02:41:41.436 --> 02:41:43.557]  We have links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:41:43.557 --> 02:41:45.918]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[02:41:45.918 --> 02:41:49.819]  And to get your video and book, both titled The Big Bad Bank.
[02:41:50.579 --> 02:41:53.782]  Also, while you're at it, folks, get, follow the Republic.
[02:41:53.782 --> 02:42:07.793]  It details who the bankers are, how they're imploding the economy by design, their own statements, their own documents, how they're using the environmental movement, the police state they're setting up to enforce it, endgame blueprint for global enslavement, covers the depopulation, their entire program.
[02:42:07.793 --> 02:42:08.993]  Everyone must see this.
[02:42:08.993 --> 02:42:10.134]  This is real.
[02:42:10.134 --> 02:42:10.855]  They're doing it.
[02:42:11.155 --> 02:42:12.736]  You ask, what is the solution?
[02:42:12.736 --> 02:42:13.617]  Education.
[02:42:13.617 --> 02:42:18.080]  Show the people that environmentalism has nothing to do with the environment.
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:20.641]  They co-opt all these good people to serve them.
[02:42:20.641 --> 02:42:22.062]  This is their takeover.
[02:42:22.062 --> 02:42:27.186]  And it's in trouble, but they've invested hundreds of billions conservatively in this propaganda.
[02:42:27.186 --> 02:42:30.408]  They're moving forward with it, but they're beginning to slow.
[02:42:30.948 --> 02:42:35.669]  If you take action and educate everyone you know, we can stop these people.
[02:42:35.669 --> 02:42:41.551]  So get the films at InfoWars.com or watch them in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:42:41.551 --> 02:42:42.652]  Let's go to calls.
[02:42:42.652 --> 02:42:44.552]  Let's talk to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[02:42:44.552 --> 02:42:47.713]  You're on the air with George Hunt.
[02:42:47.713 --> 02:42:51.094]  Yeah, a question for the guests.
[02:42:51.094 --> 02:42:57.636]  When you had met with the elite, had they had mentioned anything about, this is in the late 80s from my understanding from what you're saying,
[02:42:58.047 --> 02:43:03.269]  Anything about government-sponsored terror, in particular 9-11, being carried out in the future?
[02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:06.831]  Staging crises, staging terror attacks.
[02:43:06.831 --> 02:43:16.114]  No, there was nothing mentioned of a war, or warfare, or anti-terrorist.
[02:43:16.114 --> 02:43:19.556]  Nothing like that came up.
[02:43:19.556 --> 02:43:25.998]  They talked about using the threat of environmental catastrophe, which is another form of false flourish.
[02:43:25.998 --> 02:43:27.439]  Yeah, I missed that.
[02:43:28.129 --> 02:43:37.994]  Yeah, Ross Charles said that we were doomed to extinction if we didn't accept his bank and this program.
[02:43:37.994 --> 02:43:39.195]  He will save us!
[02:43:39.195 --> 02:43:43.618]  And now his son, we're told in the newspaper, is a Jesus archetype, literally.
[02:43:43.618 --> 02:43:49.301]  I mean, you can't make this type of bizarreness up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:49.301 --> 02:43:52.302]  The hero gene inside talks about him being a Jesus figure.
[02:43:52.302 --> 02:43:53.083]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:43:54.832 --> 02:44:07.407]  Alex, you think then that the right-wing arm of the New World Order, like this might be the left-wing arm, that carries out government-sponsored terror?
[02:44:07.407 --> 02:44:08.248]  Yes.
[02:44:08.248 --> 02:44:10.271]  Both parties, both groups do it.
[02:44:10.271 --> 02:44:12.433]  But yes, the Club of Rome said in 1991,
[02:44:13.874 --> 02:44:18.896]  That they will use, on the left, phony environmentalism, on the right, staged terror.
[02:44:18.896 --> 02:44:20.437]  We have those quotes.
[02:44:20.437 --> 02:44:21.617]  They published them.
[02:44:21.617 --> 02:44:24.699]  We have them in articles that Paul Watson's written with direct links.
[02:44:24.699 --> 02:44:27.640]  They said they will use that pincer to capture us.
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:30.321]  On the right, they'll use security and terror.
[02:44:30.321 --> 02:44:31.722]  On the left, the environment.
[02:44:31.722 --> 02:44:33.022]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[02:44:33.022 --> 02:44:36.824]  Comments on that, George Hunt?
[02:44:36.824 --> 02:44:39.025]  Oh, yes.
[02:44:39.025 --> 02:44:41.926]  The Club of Rome is the
[02:44:43.648 --> 02:45:08.171]  The group that was brought up indirectly at the Congress because Gro Harlem Bruteland, the lady that accepted Rothschild's banking program, she was there and she's the one that heads up the elimination of people on the planet.
[02:45:10.602 --> 02:45:18.664]  She's also the chairman, I think, of the United Nations UNED Committee.
[02:45:18.664 --> 02:45:21.164]  It's called the Brookland Committee.
[02:45:21.164 --> 02:45:26.025]  The UNED is the one that created UNCED.
[02:45:26.025 --> 02:45:28.105]  Isn't that a funny name?
[02:45:28.105 --> 02:45:36.267]  That's the United Nations Commission on Environment and Development, and that's the one that Rothschild was the...
[02:45:38.345 --> 02:45:43.247]  That Maury Strong was the Secretary General.
[02:45:43.247 --> 02:45:44.587]  Alright, let's take another call.
[02:45:44.587 --> 02:45:46.808]  Herman in New York, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:45:46.808 --> 02:45:49.929]  Uh, yes sir, Alex, can you hear me?
[02:45:49.929 --> 02:45:51.690]  Yes sir.
[02:45:51.690 --> 02:45:56.892]  Yeah, first thing I have a comment, first thing I have a comment and I have a question and I'll take my answer off air.
[02:45:56.892 --> 02:46:03.014]  First comment is, uh, I repost all your articles on my Facebook page, facebook.com slash 100BILLION.
[02:46:06.199 --> 02:46:14.325]  And my question for Mr. Hunt is, what's the most important part of the eugenics movement that should be highlighted and exposed?
[02:46:14.325 --> 02:46:21.310]  Because when I just say eugenics, and I just speak of the issue, it's a bit much for the average person to comprehend and follow.
[02:46:21.310 --> 02:46:22.311]  Well, they better learn.
[02:46:22.311 --> 02:46:29.536]  Herman's asking again, what is the most important part of their depopulation agenda?
[02:46:29.536 --> 02:46:35.400]  Well, the most important part is to eliminate the people
[02:46:35.876 --> 02:46:41.061]  Who are destroying the environment.
[02:46:41.061 --> 02:46:48.648]  If you look at pictures from the Bruinland Report, that's still available, I believe, from the United Nations.
[02:46:48.648 --> 02:46:56.676]  If you look at the pictures, it shows pictures of indigenous people who it's better to die.
[02:46:57.580 --> 02:46:58.861]  Than to live.
[02:46:58.861 --> 02:46:59.141]  That's right.
[02:47:18.851 --> 02:47:20.052]  Yes, Alex.
[02:47:20.052 --> 02:47:20.832]  Yes.
[02:47:20.832 --> 02:47:22.713]  Hey, I got a question.
[02:47:22.713 --> 02:47:24.694]  I'm the pastor, but here's my thing.
[02:47:24.694 --> 02:47:28.156]  You've been doing this, and he's talking about too, as far as this banking.
[02:47:28.156 --> 02:47:30.037]  They're bankers.
[02:47:30.037 --> 02:47:37.661]  Well, you've even asked, and you've asked for solutions and things like that, and people are all looking for solutions, and I think I've come up with one.
[02:47:37.661 --> 02:47:39.342]  And here it is.
[02:47:39.342 --> 02:47:40.243]  If everybody
[02:47:40.874 --> 02:47:47.380]  Quit paying on their credit cards, because these bankers are going to bankrupt the banks anyway.
[02:47:47.380 --> 02:47:49.702]  They're going to take their money out of the banks.
[02:47:49.702 --> 02:47:56.749]  And I know this is going to have an effect, because 316,000 people have left California.
[02:47:56.749 --> 02:47:58.711]  And look at the effect it's having on that.
[02:47:58.711 --> 02:48:05.437]  If people in every state just up and just quit paying on their credit cards, just up and stop it,
[02:48:09.172 --> 02:48:13.999]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:48:13.999 --> 02:48:14.680]  I mean, I'll say this.
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:21.810]  It's a very complex issue, but yes, the banks would then just get a bailout to themselves of our tax money to pay it.
[02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:30.275]  But by people not, and I'm not saying do this, it's your decision, by not supporting the system before they're ready to crash it, that will screw them up.
[02:48:30.275 --> 02:48:32.016]  And that's why they want global government.
[02:48:32.016 --> 02:48:33.898]  They talk about tax avoidance.
[02:48:33.898 --> 02:48:40.442]  They say they want an 87% total tax rate worldwide so people don't run from their control.
[02:48:40.442 --> 02:48:41.443]  And that's why they hate it.
[02:48:41.443 --> 02:48:43.284]  People are leaving Massachusetts, New York,
[02:48:43.664 --> 02:48:48.067]  Well, you know, I never thought of those ways that we could prevent these people from doing their dirty deeds.
[02:48:48.067 --> 02:48:49.588]  I think the credit card idea is a good one.
[02:49:13.607 --> 02:49:19.061]  But could you get all the people in the United States to do it together?
[02:49:19.061 --> 02:49:22.810]  Because if you're the only one that does that, you're going to lose.
[02:49:24.380 --> 02:49:40.008]  Well, also, again, they're putting their cashless thumbprint face scan buying and selling in so that if you're not in good graces with Homeland Security and with the global security network they've set up in Interpol, you won't be allowed to buy and sell even if you have the cash.
[02:49:40.008 --> 02:49:41.649]  That's what the cashless society is.
[02:49:41.649 --> 02:49:46.672]  You'll still have cash, you've just got an ID to do it, and they've openly announced they want that.
[02:49:46.672 --> 02:49:48.873]  I mean, they are coming in to squeeze you.
[02:49:48.873 --> 02:49:50.113]  They want to bankrupt you.
[02:49:50.113 --> 02:49:51.074]  They want to control you.
[02:49:52.313 --> 02:50:10.264]  I think for people who can, get into communities or loosely knit organizations rurally that decide to defend each other, decide to get each other out of debt, and then you've just got to wait for the tanks to come down the street whenever that happens and still be politically involved to try to stop that from happening.
[02:50:11.505 --> 02:50:15.846]  Prepare for the worst, but also fight to stop it.
[02:50:15.846 --> 02:50:18.827]  Again, everything's multifaceted.
[02:50:18.827 --> 02:50:27.890]  But, you see, you can't just hide out in the country and wait for them to come, but you've also got to have communities, get to know your neighbors, understand who the enemy is, and say, we're going to stick together.
[02:50:27.890 --> 02:50:36.253]  Everything the globalists do is about dividing us so we can't stick together, so they can individually come like wolves and rip our guts out.
[02:50:36.937 --> 02:50:39.299]  That's what they do overseas, too.
[02:50:39.299 --> 02:50:49.007]  They get the Shiites against the Hussites against the Jebusites, and they get these... They rile the countries up by getting the religions fighting against one another.
[02:51:01.821 --> 02:51:09.562]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.

[02:51:51.878 --> 02:51:52.679]  Purify your life today!
[02:52:02.896 --> 02:52:06.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:10.163]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.163 --> 02:52:14.968]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.968 --> 02:52:18.832]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[02:52:19.472 --> 02:52:21.333]  And they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.333 --> 02:52:26.536]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[02:52:26.536 --> 02:52:29.817]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:29.817 --> 02:52:36.661]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.661 --> 02:52:39.002]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:39.002 --> 02:52:40.603]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.603 --> 02:52:42.804]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.044 --> 02:52:47.426]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.

[02:53:02.302 --> 02:53:08.985]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:53:08.985 --> 02:53:15.387]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:53:15.387 --> 02:53:21.730]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:53:21.730 --> 02:53:26.632]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:53:27.112 --> 02:53:35.276]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:53:35.276 --> 02:53:39.878]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[02:53:39.878 --> 02:53:43.580]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[02:53:54.684 --> 02:53:56.365]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[02:53:56.365 --> 02:53:58.566]  In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry.
[02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:16.762]  They don't like you being self-sufficient.
[02:54:16.762 --> 02:54:28.050]  They don't like it when you got a four-wheel drive, a shotgun, a rifle, you know how to run a trot line, know how to grow tomatoes and homemade wine.
[02:54:39.915 --> 02:54:44.518]  They want you under their control.
[02:54:44.518 --> 02:54:47.479]  Animal ID, Prima Society is all you in.
[02:54:47.479 --> 02:54:49.200]  They're taking over your local communities.
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:51.982]  They're putting fake environmentalists in to run your life.
[02:54:51.982 --> 02:54:55.284]  He's the equivalent of Soviet commissars.
[02:54:55.284 --> 02:54:57.165]  You've got to stand up against them.
[02:54:57.165 --> 02:54:59.186]  Crank up Hank Williams Jr.
[02:54:59.186 --> 02:54:59.867]  I'm not done with him.
[02:54:59.867 --> 02:55:01.848]  I want people to hear this part.
[02:55:04.527 --> 02:55:08.810]  They don't like the country boys, whether you're black, white, old, young.
[02:55:08.810 --> 02:55:10.872]  They don't like the fact that you're self-sufficient.
[02:55:10.872 --> 02:55:15.135]  They don't like the fact that they can't make you run.
[02:55:15.135 --> 02:55:16.596]  That they can't starve you out.
[02:55:16.596 --> 02:55:19.799]  That they can't control your life.
[02:55:19.799 --> 02:55:26.344]  And this is the key to defeating them, is being self-sufficient and getting out of debt and getting our Republic back.
[02:55:26.344 --> 02:55:27.065]  Here it is!
[02:55:37.152 --> 02:55:40.094]  They don't have our guns.
[02:55:40.094 --> 02:55:43.436]  They don't have our farms like they do the Australians.
[02:55:43.436 --> 02:55:45.157]  They haven't gotten up to that point yet.
[02:55:45.157 --> 02:55:47.098]  We're going to stop them here cold.
[02:55:47.098 --> 02:55:51.720]  We're going to stop the New World Order right here.
[02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:52.541]  Look in the mirror.
[02:55:52.541 --> 02:55:53.702]  You're the resistance to it.
[02:55:53.702 --> 02:55:56.383]  We're going to have George Hunt back on in the near future.
[02:55:56.383 --> 02:55:59.605]  I really appreciate him spending so much time with us today.
[02:55:59.605 --> 02:56:02.246]  He's now known as the UN whistleblower online.
[02:56:02.246 --> 02:56:03.527]  Really devastated the enemy.
[02:56:03.527 --> 02:56:06.029]  20 plus years and it's really coming to fruit now.
[02:56:06.809 --> 02:56:08.269]  Let's go to Carl in Texas.
[02:56:08.269 --> 02:56:09.250]  Carl, you're on the air.
[02:56:09.250 --> 02:56:09.690]  Go ahead.
[02:56:09.690 --> 02:56:11.270]  Hey, Alex.
[02:56:11.270 --> 02:56:12.631]  How you doing, man?
[02:56:12.631 --> 02:56:12.951]  Good.
[02:56:12.951 --> 02:56:14.691]  Hey, look.
[02:56:14.691 --> 02:56:20.773]  I had a question for you and for George, but I guess if George is gone, I can ask you... No, George isn't gone.
[02:56:20.773 --> 02:56:21.453]  George is here.
[02:56:21.453 --> 02:56:22.173]  Oh, good.
[02:56:22.173 --> 02:56:24.714]  Good, good, good.
[02:56:24.714 --> 02:56:27.495]  Actually, Alex, you've really... You've inspired me.
[02:56:27.495 --> 02:56:31.516]  We actually filed bankruptcy about a year and a half ago.
[02:56:31.516 --> 02:56:35.157]  Well, actually, we were starting the process and we made it all official.
[02:56:35.157 --> 02:56:36.117]  But during that time,
[02:56:36.989 --> 02:56:40.690]  I questioned the dollar, wanted to find out everything I could about the dollar.
[02:56:40.690 --> 02:56:50.714]  The bottom line is, we found out everything we needed to know, and I thought all the stuff that I was learning about that Orwellian Theory about 1984, I thought initially was a joke.
[02:56:50.714 --> 02:56:51.874]  And it's not.
[02:56:51.874 --> 02:56:53.075]  The stuff is real.
[02:56:53.075 --> 02:56:54.135]  I'm 43.
[02:56:54.135 --> 02:56:56.196]  I know it's very real.
[02:56:56.196 --> 02:57:02.178]  But you've actually inspired me to start another business that sells home security and personal protection products.
[02:57:02.901 --> 02:57:05.945]  But, one question I have for you, because I'm a fighter.
[02:57:05.945 --> 02:57:06.726]  I'm like you.
[02:57:06.726 --> 02:57:07.467]  I'm a fighter.
[02:57:07.467 --> 02:57:08.088]  I don't like to run away.
[02:57:08.088 --> 02:57:08.408]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:57:08.408 --> 02:57:09.089]  We don't have a lot of time.
[02:57:09.089 --> 02:57:10.150]  We got George Hunt here with you.
[02:57:10.150 --> 02:57:11.152]  Go ahead.
[02:57:11.152 --> 02:57:16.098]  But, you did mention in one of your other episodes, you said, hey, things become too unstable.
[02:57:16.098 --> 02:57:17.400]  I'd go to a third world country.
[02:57:17.941 --> 02:57:21.243]  But how welcomed would we be in another country?
[02:57:21.243 --> 02:57:21.924]  In what country?
[02:57:48.801 --> 02:57:52.663]  Well, my wife's ancestor was on the Mayflower, too.
[02:57:52.663 --> 02:57:57.406]  They must have been shipmates.
[02:57:57.406 --> 02:57:58.426]  I don't know.
[02:57:58.426 --> 02:58:04.369]  I don't really know the question that came up, but since this... Nowhere to run!
[02:58:04.369 --> 02:58:05.269]  Nowhere to run!
[02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:15.134]  He's saying... I just want to bring up again that Maury Strong, it looks like he's been rewarded with an $8 billion payoff.
[02:58:15.134 --> 02:58:17.195]  I'm going to launch
[02:58:17.833 --> 02:58:18.273]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:58:18.273 --> 02:58:20.475]  We're going to do five more minutes.
[02:58:20.475 --> 02:58:23.517]  I want you to be able to finish back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:47.654]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.654 --> 02:58:50.862]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:52.113 --> 02:58:55.115]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:55.115 --> 02:59:00.460]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.460 --> 02:59:02.501]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.501 --> 02:59:07.505]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.505 --> 02:59:08.686]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.686 --> 02:59:09.807]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.807 --> 02:59:11.688]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.688 --> 02:59:12.769]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.769 --> 02:59:14.971]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.971 --> 02:59:16.312]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:16.312 --> 02:59:17.633]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.833 --> 02:59:23.096]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:23.096 --> 02:59:26.678]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.678 --> 02:59:30.500]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:31.721]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.721 --> 02:59:32.621]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.621 --> 02:59:33.742]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.742 --> 02:59:34.482]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.482 --> 02:59:35.463]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.743 --> 02:59:38.804]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.804 --> 02:59:41.005]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:41.005 --> 02:59:42.006]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:42.006 --> 02:59:43.206]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.206 --> 02:59:45.027]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:05.998 --> 03:00:06.282]  I don't know.
[03:00:20.852 --> 03:00:22.733]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[03:00:22.733 --> 03:00:23.934]  I meant to do an hour interview.
[03:00:23.934 --> 03:00:27.896]  We're now past two hours, and I've got a ton of important stuff to cover.
[03:00:27.896 --> 03:00:30.657]  Coming up in the next segment, continue with your open phones.
[03:00:30.657 --> 03:00:32.638]  And all these callers are bringing up great points.
[03:00:32.638 --> 03:00:34.539]  I'm sorry to cut some people short.
[03:00:34.539 --> 03:00:36.080]  We just have limited time.
[03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:40.642]  But yes, George, we're going to have you back up, try to support your whistleblowing.
[03:00:40.642 --> 03:00:47.665]  Hopefully have you back up in the next few weeks so we can just take calls and talk about going after Maury Strong, the Climategate people, Ben Santer,
[03:00:50.183 --> 03:00:50.704]  All of them.
[03:00:50.704 --> 03:00:51.885]  Phil Jones.
[03:00:51.885 --> 03:00:55.027]  We need to have these people exposed and indicted.
[03:00:55.027 --> 03:00:58.170]  A lot of them already are in the process or have been indicted.
[03:00:58.170 --> 03:01:00.672]  But let's go to Bob in Ohio.
[03:01:00.672 --> 03:01:03.255]  You're on the air in a final quick segment with George Hunt.
[03:01:03.255 --> 03:01:04.335]  Amazing interview.
[03:01:04.335 --> 03:01:05.977]  We appreciate George's courage.
[03:01:05.977 --> 03:01:06.838]  Bob, you're on the air.
[03:01:06.838 --> 03:01:07.678]  Go ahead.
[03:01:07.678 --> 03:01:08.799]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:01:08.799 --> 03:01:10.121]  Good.
[03:01:10.121 --> 03:01:14.965]  I've been meaning to call for a long time and it's crazy how apropos this call will be today.
[03:01:15.922 --> 03:01:28.165]  I moved into the sticks early 90s about the same time period and I became associated with someone who claimed to be in league or knew of the elites and was close personal friends with him.
[03:01:28.165 --> 03:01:35.107]  He tapped me as a guy who was intelligent and for some reason wanted me to know some facts and he asked me if I ever knew about
[03:01:35.854 --> 03:01:43.816]  The New World Order and the Trilateral Commission and those things, and I told him I knew some things, and so he invited me to ask him some questions.
[03:01:43.816 --> 03:01:48.237]  I said, how will we know when the New World Order is going to be installed?
[03:01:48.237 --> 03:01:52.378]  Or first, first, I said, how will they go about installing it?
[03:01:52.378 --> 03:02:00.779]  Because they'll get us in so many conflicts around the globe that we won't be able to defend ourselves, and a seemingly foreign power would step in and take us over.
[03:02:00.779 --> 03:02:03.480]  I said, how will we know when it's about to happen?
[03:02:04.079 --> 03:02:07.140]  And he said if they ever hit the Pentagon, look out.
[03:02:07.140 --> 03:02:12.182]  And it was whenever 9-11 happened to me, and of course that was years before that.
[03:02:12.182 --> 03:02:15.603]  And this guy said that he was a member of the elite.
[03:02:15.603 --> 03:02:17.423]  He was affiliated with them.
[03:02:17.423 --> 03:02:18.824]  He was a very intelligent man.
[03:02:18.824 --> 03:02:20.424]  Yeah, they love to brag.
[03:02:20.424 --> 03:02:22.345]  George Hunt comments on what Bob just said.
[03:02:23.032 --> 03:02:29.898]  Oh, they love to brag, and I wish that you had a recorder with you when you're talking to that person.
[03:02:29.898 --> 03:02:42.268]  They were one of the ones that were in the know, and they like people to know that they're in the know, but if anyone finds out that they've told their secrets, they get killed.
[03:02:42.268 --> 03:02:46.892]  Bob, call us back again sometime, because I want to hear more of your story.
[03:02:46.892 --> 03:02:47.452]  Thank you.
[03:02:47.452 --> 03:02:49.474]  Finishing up, George, go ahead.
[03:02:49.474 --> 03:02:51.696]  Well, I don't know how to finish this, except that
[03:02:52.833 --> 03:03:00.779]  We are confronted with a new world order that will take away the freedom of every citizen in the world.
[03:03:00.779 --> 03:03:04.281]  And if we don't call them out now, we never will.
[03:03:07.881 --> 03:03:08.481]  It's our last chance.
[03:03:08.481 --> 03:03:08.721]  That's right.
[03:03:25.430 --> 03:03:31.353]  And so people need to see themselves as leaders, wake up their friends, their families, their neighbors, educate them.
[03:03:31.353 --> 03:03:33.535]  Films are a great way to do it.
[03:03:33.535 --> 03:03:35.356]  Radio shows are a great way to do it.
[03:03:35.356 --> 03:03:37.377]  Read books, get educated yourself.
[03:03:37.377 --> 03:03:39.398]  Educate your city council.
[03:03:39.398 --> 03:03:44.141]  When these environmentalists come around, they want to steal your property, brainwash your kids.
[03:03:44.141 --> 03:03:46.062]  On record, they've got to be stopped.
[03:03:46.062 --> 03:03:50.004]  And George, I'm glad you're doing an investigation on Maury Strong and others.
[03:03:50.004 --> 03:03:51.525]  You're talking about filing suit on them.
[03:03:53.325 --> 03:04:08.631]  I'll be filing suit within two weeks and after I find a lawyer that is up to the fight.
[03:04:08.631 --> 03:04:17.294]  And then after they're sued, they'll probably pay some heavy fines and I'll get 30% of their heavy fines because I'm an official
[03:04:17.890 --> 03:04:19.557]  Whistle blower.
[03:04:19.557 --> 03:04:22.387]  So there's something in it for people that blow whistles.
[03:04:23.635 --> 03:04:25.056]  And you can use that to fight them more.
[03:04:25.056 --> 03:04:36.359]  You've certainly spent a lot of time the last 22 years fighting these people, and we're just glad that you almost bumbled into all of this and that you were an upstanding person who would have the courage to fight them and expose them.
[03:04:36.359 --> 03:04:38.620]  The website is TheBigBadBank.com.
[03:04:38.620 --> 03:04:41.001]  We've got books and videos there available.
[03:04:41.001 --> 03:04:46.463]  And again, Endgame at InfoWars.com, the preeminent film to expose this entire agenda.
[03:04:46.463 --> 03:04:52.205]  George, let me say bye to you during the break, and we're going to be talking to you again, and Jan and other great folks in your office.
[03:04:53.066 --> 03:04:57.231]  About having you back on and phase two of our operation against the New World Order.
[03:04:57.231 --> 03:05:01.856]  I'm going to come back with all the government health care news, the banking news, the flu news.
[03:05:01.856 --> 03:05:02.958]  What's your home worth?
[03:05:02.958 --> 03:05:05.080]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[03:05:05.080 --> 03:05:07.764]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[03:05:08.104 --> 03:05:15.809]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of the tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[03:05:15.809 --> 03:05:19.471]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[03:05:19.471 --> 03:05:21.932]  It's so easy, and best of all, it's free.
[03:05:21.932 --> 03:05:30.217]  At HomeGain.com, you can compare realtors anonymously, receive customized proposals, see consumer reviews, then select the best realtor for you.
[03:05:30.217 --> 03:05:33.199]  Go to HomeGain.com and get an instant home value estimate.
[03:05:33.379 --> 03:05:33.879]  Let's do it!
[03:06:03.288 --> 03:06:07.317]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:07.317 --> 03:06:10.564]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:10.564 --> 03:06:11.966]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:06:12.868 --> 03:06:15.350]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:06:15.350 --> 03:06:21.736]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:21.736 --> 03:06:27.280]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:06:27.280 --> 03:06:36.928]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:06:37.048 --> 03:06:39.370]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:06:39.370 --> 03:06:40.971]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:40.971 --> 03:06:43.432]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:43.432 --> 03:06:45.274]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:06:45.274 --> 03:06:50.697]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:06:50.697 --> 03:06:59.823]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:07:02.608 --> 03:07:04.389]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:07:04.389 --> 03:07:06.789]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[03:07:06.789 --> 03:07:10.351]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[03:07:10.351 --> 03:07:15.112]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[03:07:15.112 --> 03:07:20.274]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[03:07:20.874 --> 03:07:25.375]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[03:07:25.375 --> 03:07:31.817]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[03:07:31.817 --> 03:07:33.458]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[03:07:33.458 --> 03:07:36.859]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier.
[03:07:37.179 --> 03:07:37.579]  I think so.
[03:08:03.337 --> 03:08:09.984]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.984 --> 03:08:12.968]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.924 --> 03:08:19.448]  In the spirit of 2010, I've told you that I am going to take more calls.
[03:08:19.448 --> 03:08:24.033]  I was getting to where I went two or three shows sometimes without taking calls because I'm covering news and have guests on.
[03:08:24.033 --> 03:08:28.477]  I'm going to talk to Joe, John, Dave, Ryan and Dennis in this segment.
[03:08:28.477 --> 03:08:33.241]  And then for the last 40 minutes, I am going to cover BankerGate.
[03:08:34.002 --> 03:08:37.644]  What's happening with the flu blowing up in their face?
[03:08:37.644 --> 03:08:42.146]  Openly exposed as fraud and a criminal hoax, exactly as we said it was.
[03:08:42.146 --> 03:08:45.688]  We're vindicated, documented, proven again.
[03:08:45.688 --> 03:08:48.109]  Also, what's happening with health care?
[03:08:48.109 --> 03:08:50.711]  It's all coming up.
[03:08:50.711 --> 03:08:58.955]  But, man, what an amazing two-hour interview with George Hunt, who just got out of the hospital with Guillaume Baret.
[03:08:58.955 --> 03:09:00.416]  Glad to hear that he's doing better.
[03:09:02.256 --> 03:09:04.038]  So many people get that now.
[03:09:04.038 --> 03:09:05.319]  Not just from vaccines.
[03:09:05.319 --> 03:09:06.019]  It's pretty spooky.
[03:09:06.019 --> 03:09:08.982]  All the barium salts, aluminum dioxide being sprayed on us.
[03:09:08.982 --> 03:09:16.548]  They're spiking more than half, according to the Washington Post, of the corn syrup with mercury, telling you it's nutritious.
[03:09:16.548 --> 03:09:17.148]  I'm not kidding.
[03:09:17.148 --> 03:09:18.149]  Saying it's not nutritious.
[03:09:18.149 --> 03:09:18.990]  It's not nutritious.
[03:09:18.990 --> 03:09:20.050]  It eats your brain.
[03:09:20.050 --> 03:09:23.653]  So we're glad that George is doing better.
[03:09:23.653 --> 03:09:26.456]  Just amazing inside information.
[03:09:26.456 --> 03:09:28.217]  All documented 22 years later.
[03:09:28.217 --> 03:09:29.678]  Proven in triplicate.
[03:09:29.678 --> 03:09:30.559]  Proven in spades.
[03:09:33.769 --> 03:09:39.012]  I'm going to jam in five calls here in T-minus minute and a half.
[03:09:39.012 --> 03:09:46.036]  So be ready with your questions, your comments, your plugs, your tractor you've got for sale, whatever it is.
[03:09:46.036 --> 03:09:47.017]  That's coming up.
[03:09:47.017 --> 03:09:50.479]  But speaking of folks that make this show possible, I want to tell you about those guys right now.
[03:09:52.591 --> 03:09:57.155]  That is DigiNet personal audio video recording systems.
[03:09:57.155 --> 03:10:03.861]  Sunglasses with the little bubble chip in them that record hours of video and audio.
[03:10:03.861 --> 03:10:05.663]  Hidden camera in the sunglasses.
[03:10:05.663 --> 03:10:08.826]  Great because sometimes with a hidden camera you don't know what you're shooting.
[03:10:08.826 --> 03:10:11.889]  But with sunglasses, if I'd have had that in Bohemian Grove, my goodness.
[03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:14.730]  Because you turn your head, you know what you're shooting.
[03:10:14.730 --> 03:10:20.712]  Just amazing system, very inexpensive, high quality, hidden DigiNet pins, a bunch of other great products.
[03:10:20.712 --> 03:10:25.954]  They're a huge seller to government, you name it, and corporations, so you get the lowest prices I've seen.
[03:10:25.954 --> 03:10:29.756]  Before I knew about this company, I paid double for the similar systems.
[03:10:29.756 --> 03:10:31.116]  I thought I was getting a good deal.
[03:10:31.116 --> 03:10:34.318]  Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net, Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net.
[03:10:37.819 --> 03:10:39.983]  NET.net, Diginet.net.
[03:10:39.983 --> 03:10:41.785]  Their phone number is also on their website.
[03:10:41.785 --> 03:10:43.348]  Check them out today.
[03:10:43.348 --> 03:10:45.531]  Also, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:10:45.531 --> 03:10:46.112]  Give them a call, 877-327-0365.
[03:10:50.353 --> 03:10:56.140]  Super high quality, organic, non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds.
[03:10:56.140 --> 03:11:00.064]  Get a seed bank you plant with this spring coming up in two months or so.
[03:11:00.064 --> 03:11:04.049]  So cold though, might come up in three months with the global warming and all.
[03:11:04.049 --> 03:11:05.451]  I wish we had some warming.
[03:11:05.451 --> 03:11:08.674]  Survivalseedbank.com and then save a seed bank or give it as a gift.
[03:11:09.616 --> 03:11:12.138]  This is just such, again, it's human.
[03:11:12.138 --> 03:11:14.922]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[03:11:14.922 --> 03:11:20.608]  Getting back to nature, getting back to true sustainability, getting back to the earth and not the globalist counterfeit of it.
[03:11:20.608 --> 03:11:21.870]  Survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:22.070]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.651]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[03:11:29.699 --> 03:11:42.793]  And finally, I have looked at a lot of countries, and if you do, I know the health rangers move down there, a lot of people are, especially in the mountain areas, it's like 65 to 70 degrees year-round, above 5,000 feet.
[03:11:42.793 --> 03:11:43.674]  One of the better places.
[03:11:44.839 --> 03:11:46.361]  And that's Ecuador.
[03:11:46.361 --> 03:11:48.683]  And EcuadorCentral.com has a lot of great info.
[03:11:48.683 --> 03:11:53.248]  Ecuador Central believes we have a duty to protect our families and our wealth.
[03:11:53.248 --> 03:11:56.272]  If you're considering a new life somewhere else or want a second home outside the U.S.
[03:11:56.272 --> 03:12:00.736]  or if you want to invest in a growing economy, EcuadorCentral.com can help you.
[03:12:01.397 --> 03:12:06.199]  Ecuador is a country with friendly people, good food, and great weather all year round, where you can live better for a lot less.
[03:12:06.199 --> 03:12:07.459]  Boy, that's the truth.
[03:12:07.459 --> 03:12:08.880]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:10.581]  That's Ecuador Central.
[03:12:10.581 --> 03:12:13.482]  Ecuador spelled E-C-U-A-D-O-R.
[03:12:13.482 --> 03:12:16.043]  That's EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:12:16.043 --> 03:12:17.523]  Check them out today.
[03:12:17.523 --> 03:12:21.565]  And they have a lot of audio and video clips up there on the site as well.
[03:12:21.565 --> 03:12:22.906]  Okay, boom!
[03:12:22.906 --> 03:12:26.207]  Let's take five calls in the next eight minutes, and then I'm going to news.
[03:12:26.207 --> 03:12:27.287]  Joe in Pennsylvania.
[03:12:27.287 --> 03:12:28.408]  You're on... Oh, I already went to Joe.
[03:12:28.928 --> 03:12:29.689]  Is this a new list?
[03:12:29.689 --> 03:12:33.872]  Because I already thought I had a Joe in Pennsylvania.
[03:12:33.872 --> 03:12:34.552]  Okay, new list.
[03:12:34.552 --> 03:12:35.593]  Another Joe in Pennsylvania.
[03:12:35.593 --> 03:12:36.033]  Go ahead, Joe.
[03:12:36.033 --> 03:12:38.295]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:12:38.295 --> 03:12:39.295]  Good, go ahead.
[03:12:39.295 --> 03:12:42.297]  Yeah, I'm a great fan of yours and thanks for waking me up.
[03:12:42.297 --> 03:12:44.299]  I've been following you for the longest time.
[03:12:44.299 --> 03:12:46.220]  And I've been passing the disc around.
[03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:47.501]  I got copies.
[03:12:47.501 --> 03:12:48.202]  I got covers.
[03:12:48.202 --> 03:12:49.823]  I also have a following behind me.
[03:12:49.823 --> 03:12:52.845]  Anyway, your show is fantastic, as always.
[03:12:52.845 --> 03:12:55.567]  And I'm glad you're a whistleblower.
[03:12:55.567 --> 03:12:56.307]  I am, too.
[03:12:56.307 --> 03:12:58.469]  I put a lot of your videos on my website.
[03:12:59.105 --> 03:13:02.248]  And I just want to say hello, and I'm not here plugged for you, son.
[03:13:02.248 --> 03:13:03.289]  Oh no, I know it's a plug.
[03:13:03.289 --> 03:13:04.350]  Oh, please, please.
[03:13:04.350 --> 03:13:05.591]  Yeah, I'm plugged.
[03:13:05.591 --> 03:13:06.732]  Can I give my address to that?
[03:13:06.732 --> 03:13:08.133]  Yeah, go ahead, sir.
[03:13:08.133 --> 03:13:11.196]  It's H-O-P-E-S Fort LaMarre dot org.
[03:13:11.196 --> 03:13:13.858]  I've got a lot of your videos, a lot of stuff up there.
[03:13:13.858 --> 03:13:14.819]  I've got Comeback.
[03:13:14.819 --> 03:13:16.961]  I've got videos out on my job.
[03:13:16.961 --> 03:13:18.983]  I've got to pick up the chemtrails.
[03:13:18.983 --> 03:13:19.704]  Everything.
[03:13:19.704 --> 03:13:20.645]  And I'm so happy.
[03:13:20.645 --> 03:13:22.046]  Well, that's awesome, Joe.
[03:13:22.046 --> 03:13:25.169]  Other than your website, what else is going on?
[03:13:25.862 --> 03:13:27.704]  I got a big mailing list every day.
[03:13:27.704 --> 03:13:33.168]  I spend like five hours putting out all your... So you're fighting hard and that's why we're starting to really, really have an effect.
[03:13:33.168 --> 03:13:33.949]  I gotta move quick.
[03:13:33.949 --> 03:13:35.330]  Thank you, Joe.
[03:13:35.330 --> 03:13:37.012]  John in New York, you're on the air.
[03:13:37.012 --> 03:13:39.894]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[03:13:39.894 --> 03:13:41.496]  Good, I'm doing alright.
[03:13:41.496 --> 03:13:41.996]  Good.
[03:13:41.996 --> 03:13:42.977]  I just had a question.
[03:13:42.977 --> 03:13:47.501]  You actually said one of them about the... Have you seen the commercials for the corn syrup now?
[03:13:47.501 --> 03:13:48.642]  They're saying how good it is for you?
[03:13:49.349 --> 03:13:53.031]  Yep, mercury in corn syrup is yummy for your tummy.
[03:13:53.031 --> 03:13:54.812]  You care about your son or daughter?
[03:13:54.812 --> 03:13:56.993]  Give them corn syrup with mercury.
[03:13:56.993 --> 03:13:59.334]  I've got the newscast saying it's good for your child's brain.
[03:13:59.334 --> 03:14:00.414]  I mean, it's not, folks.
[03:14:00.414 --> 03:14:01.555]  It's deadly poison.
[03:14:01.555 --> 03:14:03.876]  But now that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:14:03.876 --> 03:14:06.677]  Yeah, there's these nuts that think mercury ain't good.
[03:14:06.677 --> 03:14:08.458]  Them people's crazy!
[03:14:08.458 --> 03:14:10.199]  Exactly.
[03:14:10.199 --> 03:14:10.899]  Ridiculous.
[03:14:10.899 --> 03:14:16.462]  My other question was, I happened to be flipping through the History Channel the other day, and I saw Earth 2100.
[03:14:16.462 --> 03:14:18.543]  I don't know if you've seen anything about this.
[03:14:19.324 --> 03:14:31.070]  It's like a poorly animated Japanese cartoon about how this family's traveling from California to New York because there's nothing but famine on the West Coast.
[03:14:31.070 --> 03:14:43.616]  Yes, they've got scores of shows about death, famine, world government saving us, everyone's starving, or all these shows about humans are gone from the earth, it's an Eden, how beautiful it would be if we were all dead.
[03:14:43.616 --> 03:14:46.538]  It's just 24-7 creating a guilt complex
[03:14:47.472 --> 03:14:50.334]  Just like they use, you know, you're a Nazi if you don't want big government.
[03:14:50.334 --> 03:14:53.276]  Well, you want to kill the Earth if you don't want big government.
[03:14:53.276 --> 03:14:58.439]  And so they're creating a guilt complex that I must kill myself, it's for the Earth!
[03:14:58.439 --> 03:15:01.802]  It's terrible, I mean, it just gets your blood boiling right away.
[03:15:01.802 --> 03:15:05.844]  My son and I, he's 18, we listen to, you know, we listen to your show every single day.
[03:15:05.844 --> 03:15:09.627]  And it's like, as soon as we saw that, we watched it for a little while, you know, because we wanted to see what it was about.
[03:15:09.627 --> 03:15:10.447]  We just couldn't do it.
[03:15:10.447 --> 03:15:11.748]  It's terrible.
[03:15:11.748 --> 03:15:15.691]  Well, we should, we should download it online and do a review of it.
[03:15:15.691 --> 03:15:16.411]  So it's called Earth 2100.
[03:15:17.912 --> 03:15:20.915]  Yes, I think it's history, it might be discovery, I'm not sure.
[03:15:20.915 --> 03:15:23.697]  But don't worry, I'm familiar, I saw a blurb on it.
[03:15:23.697 --> 03:15:27.641]  Don't worry, at the end of the episodes, the global government will save us.
[03:15:27.641 --> 03:15:31.345]  I'm sure there's an environmental group fighting globally to stop it.
[03:15:31.345 --> 03:15:38.792]  They tried, no one listened, no one accepted Christ, Savior, Rothschild, the Christ.
[03:15:38.792 --> 03:15:40.553]  I appreciate your call, John.
[03:15:40.553 --> 03:15:41.854]  Dave in Maine.
[03:15:41.854 --> 03:15:43.156]  Dave, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:15:44.386 --> 03:15:50.568]  Hi Alex, George mentioned earlier about the possibility of using an EMP and I wanted to remind the listeners
[03:15:51.221 --> 03:16:09.188]  ...of a book that was heavily pushed by Newt Gingrich called One Second After that talked about the effects of an EMP... Yeah, they could do a bunch of EMPs, blame it on Al-Qaeda, use the... The studies show EMPs would knock everything out, but it would cause a lot of disruption to satellites and systems based on it, and then use that as another false flag.
[03:16:09.188 --> 03:16:13.069]  Look, when you're evil, you don't have rules, and you're the governing authority.
[03:16:13.069 --> 03:16:15.630]  There's all these great ways to stage terror.
[03:16:17.071 --> 03:16:17.871]  Absolutely.
[03:16:17.871 --> 03:16:29.838]  We have a review of that book on our website and also just published a review and highlights of a book written almost 80 years ago by Bertrand Russell, which is absolutely amazing.
[03:16:29.838 --> 03:16:33.620]  Tell us your website, Dave.
[03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:36.202]  Somethingmustbreak.net.
[03:16:36.202 --> 03:16:36.642]  Great.
[03:16:36.642 --> 03:16:41.945]  And any good articles people want us to post or link to, send them to writersandinfowars.com.
[03:16:41.945 --> 03:16:42.945]  I'd like to see that.
[03:16:42.945 --> 03:16:44.046]  Anything else, Dave?
[03:16:45.305 --> 03:16:45.905]  No, that's it.
[03:16:45.905 --> 03:16:47.686]  Thanks for all you do, Alex.
[03:16:47.686 --> 03:16:48.706]  Really appreciate it.
[03:16:48.706 --> 03:16:50.186]  Thank you so much, Dave.
[03:16:50.186 --> 03:16:58.629]  It isn't that I mind the plugs, it's just that sometimes every caller... But I guess that's evidence of how people are taking action.
[03:16:58.629 --> 03:17:00.089]  It just, it kills talk radio.
[03:17:00.089 --> 03:17:01.309]  Because people want to hear content.
[03:17:01.309 --> 03:17:02.170]  They want to hear your ideas.
[03:17:02.170 --> 03:17:06.731]  Like, hey, they want to hear about EMP and Newt Gingrich hyping it, which you're right, he did.
[03:17:06.731 --> 03:17:09.912]  And then it's... Then there's... It's kind of overload.
[03:17:09.912 --> 03:17:10.572]  But that's okay.
[03:17:10.572 --> 03:17:10.872]  Whatever.
[03:17:12.065 --> 03:17:20.148]  I had to put a stop to it about 10 years ago for a while when people started calling in going, I got a tractor for sale, I'm in this town in Missouri, here's my number, literally.
[03:17:20.148 --> 03:17:21.348]  And I said, look!
[03:17:21.348 --> 03:17:22.949]  It stops there!
[03:17:22.949 --> 03:17:26.930]  It stops!
[03:17:26.930 --> 03:17:28.491]  Let's talk to Ryan in Alaska.
[03:17:28.491 --> 03:17:30.331]  Ryan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:17:30.331 --> 03:17:31.371]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[03:17:31.371 --> 03:17:32.352]  Yes, sir.
[03:17:32.352 --> 03:17:35.493]  Yeah, regarding the whole banker gangster situation.
[03:17:36.846 --> 03:17:40.628]  Ben Bernanke was recently on the cover of Time Magazine as Person of the Year.
[03:17:40.628 --> 03:17:42.329]  Oh yeah, they give awards.
[03:17:42.329 --> 03:17:45.971]  Forbes is giving the award to the best corporation being Monsanto.
[03:17:45.971 --> 03:17:53.075]  They give evil people awards as like a sick joke and so the general yuppies go, well it must be good, they're getting awards.
[03:17:53.075 --> 03:17:54.336]  The bankers must be good.
[03:17:54.336 --> 03:17:56.878]  Time Magazine says Bernanke loves me.
[03:17:56.878 --> 03:17:58.218]  Mercury must be good.
[03:17:58.218 --> 03:18:01.480]  CBS News says it's good for my child.
[03:18:01.480 --> 03:18:03.682]  But they have convulsions when I give it to them.
[03:18:06.263 --> 03:18:07.223]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:18:07.223 --> 03:18:10.205]  Nobel Peace Prize.
[03:18:10.205 --> 03:18:11.245]  Anything else?
[03:18:11.245 --> 03:18:12.426]  Yes, I am.
[03:18:12.426 --> 03:18:14.547]  Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize also?
[03:18:14.547 --> 03:18:17.308]  Yes, it's all a sick joke.
[03:18:17.308 --> 03:18:20.670]  Well, your interview today, the clips are really terrifying.
[03:18:20.670 --> 03:18:23.591]  I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm scared.
[03:18:24.619 --> 03:18:30.843]  Well, you know, listen, when you hang out over a cliff, you get scared because that's instinct, telling you get away from the cliff.
[03:18:30.843 --> 03:18:32.343]  Well, the New World Order's got us cornered.
[03:18:32.343 --> 03:18:33.044]  We got to fight them.
[03:18:33.044 --> 03:18:35.025]  We can't get away from this cliff.
[03:18:35.025 --> 03:18:37.146]  We've got to figure out how to scale it.
[03:18:37.146 --> 03:18:40.008]  And so, yes, you're meant to be concerned.
[03:18:40.008 --> 03:18:41.829]  But once you put fear into action,
[03:18:43.226 --> 03:18:44.667]  You don't have fear anymore.
[03:18:44.667 --> 03:18:48.010]  My only fear is I'll get killed and won't be able to continue this work.
[03:18:48.010 --> 03:18:50.392]  My only fear is that I don't do a good enough job.
[03:18:50.392 --> 03:18:52.354]  My only fear is I won't work hard enough.
[03:18:52.354 --> 03:18:56.798]  My only fear is I'll get worldly and want to take off a little bit of time.
[03:18:56.798 --> 03:18:59.941]  But then I realize all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[03:19:01.943 --> 03:19:03.844]  And I've had to realize I beat myself up.
[03:19:03.844 --> 03:19:05.644]  I can't do it all.
[03:19:05.644 --> 03:19:09.165]  And that's why it's so great to see the dividends of Liberty coming in.
[03:19:09.165 --> 03:19:11.526]  And we're really starting to have victories, Ryan.
[03:19:11.526 --> 03:19:12.466]  And that's what's exciting.
[03:19:12.466 --> 03:19:14.367]  God bless you.
[03:19:14.367 --> 03:19:15.747]  Okay.
[03:19:15.747 --> 03:19:20.629]  If Dennis, John, John, and Scott want to hold, I may be able to get to you towards the end of the show.
[03:19:20.629 --> 03:19:28.991]  But I do need to news blitz on BankerGate on our big victory against the Flumongers.
[03:19:28.991 --> 03:19:30.432]  Openly they're being exposed now.
[03:19:31.744 --> 03:19:41.530]  And on health care, it's all coming up after this quick break right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[03:19:41.530 --> 03:19:43.972]  And I'm here live Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[03:19:43.972 --> 03:19:45.553]  to 3 p.m., 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[03:19:45.553 --> 03:19:47.034]  Eastern, 11 a.m.
[03:19:47.034 --> 03:19:47.614]  to 3 p.m.
[03:19:47.614 --> 03:19:48.435]  Central.
[03:19:48.435 --> 03:19:51.957]  We have the free podcast on the listen link at the top of InfoWars.com.
[03:19:51.957 --> 03:19:53.118]  Go subscribe to that.
[03:19:53.118 --> 03:19:54.398]  Tell your friends and family about it.
[03:19:54.398 --> 03:19:55.819]  Listen how they want, when they want.
[03:19:55.819 --> 03:19:57.320]  That's how you really help, too.
[03:19:57.320 --> 03:19:58.621]  This show is doing a lot of great work.
[03:19:58.621 --> 03:19:59.461]  Spread the word about it.
[03:19:59.461 --> 03:20:00.002]  I know you are.
[03:20:02.153 --> 03:20:03.954]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[03:20:03.954 --> 03:20:05.776]  You may have storable food questions.
[03:20:05.776 --> 03:20:10.619]  You may want to buy your freeze-dry foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[03:20:10.619 --> 03:20:12.400]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[03:20:12.400 --> 03:20:14.842]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[03:20:14.842 --> 03:20:17.704]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.

[03:21:03.162 --> 03:21:07.186]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:07.186 --> 03:21:10.429]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:11.850]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:21:12.532 --> 03:21:15.213]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:15.213 --> 03:21:21.594]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.594 --> 03:21:26.795]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.795 --> 03:21:36.777]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.897 --> 03:21:39.239]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:39.239 --> 03:21:40.840]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.840 --> 03:21:43.303]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:43.303 --> 03:21:45.424]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:45.424 --> 03:21:50.569]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:50.569 --> 03:21:55.593]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:22:02.051 --> 03:22:04.473]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:04.473 --> 03:22:05.013]  January 12th, 2010.
[03:22:05.013 --> 03:22:05.914]  Gold opened this morning at $1149.40.
[03:22:05.914 --> 03:22:09.156]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1180.55, $590.27 for a half ounce, or $295.14 for the quarter ounce.
[03:22:09.156 --> 03:22:09.636]  That's $1180.55, $590.27, or $295.14.
[03:22:21.344 --> 03:22:34.989]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:22:34.989 --> 03:22:36.229]  Is this capitalism?
[03:22:36.229 --> 03:22:43.552]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, the central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:22:43.792 --> 03:22:44.912]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:44.912 --> 03:22:49.254]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:22:49.254 --> 03:22:50.355]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.355 --> 03:22:51.615]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:22:51.615 --> 03:22:52.015]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:52.015 --> 03:22:52.436]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:11.803 --> 03:23:12.183]  I think so.
[03:23:33.720 --> 03:23:48.426]  PureBulk.com carries Atomic Iodine, Red Wine Extract, Gingko Biloba, Oil of Oregano, Natural Coffee Caffeine, L-Arginine, Resveratrol, Hyaluronic Acid, Creatine, Curcumin, Pine Bark Extract, Grape Seed Extract, and more.

[03:23:54.269 --> 03:23:54.729]  Or call 406-251-3270.
[03:23:54.729 --> 03:23:55.850]  That's 406-251-3270 today.
[03:24:09.705 --> 03:24:13.168]  I was just shown a new Kay Bailey Hutchinson ad.
[03:24:13.168 --> 03:24:14.189]  She's running for governor.
[03:24:14.189 --> 03:24:16.431]  The senator is against Rick Perry.
[03:24:16.431 --> 03:24:19.354]  She's a Bilderberg Group member and steering committee member.
[03:24:19.354 --> 03:24:21.456]  Top globalist.
[03:24:21.456 --> 03:24:24.399]  Perry has just been an attendee.
[03:24:24.399 --> 03:24:25.980]  Perry's horrible.
[03:24:25.980 --> 03:24:32.326]  She's running an ad openly exposing that it is a UN takeover.
[03:24:38.763 --> 03:24:43.326]  And the fact is that once she gets in office, she'll continue with the toll roads, but she's desperate.
[03:24:43.326 --> 03:24:47.009]  She's losing right now, so she'll go ahead and tell the truth.
[03:24:47.009 --> 03:24:53.574]  So that's coming up, just an example of how these people operate.
[03:24:53.574 --> 03:24:57.537]  Also, there's another video clip we were sent last night that we didn't post.
[03:24:58.353 --> 03:25:01.235]  Because we were too busy and didn't get around to it.
[03:25:01.235 --> 03:25:04.118]  Plus, it's... I don't know what I really think of the clip.
[03:25:04.118 --> 03:25:06.019]  I'll tell you about it at the end of the show.
[03:25:06.019 --> 03:25:08.681]  It'll be up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:25:08.681 --> 03:25:09.542]  It has been posted.
[03:25:09.542 --> 03:25:13.345]  I'm not going to tell you what it is until we discuss it.
[03:25:13.345 --> 03:25:16.847]  I'll show you the headline once it's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:25:16.847 --> 03:25:18.168]  Well, we have Aaron right here.
[03:25:18.168 --> 03:25:20.730]  Just have Doug give him the clip.
[03:25:21.761 --> 03:25:23.864]  I covered some of this in the first hour.
[03:25:37.580 --> 03:25:44.746]  But the bigger news issue is that on every front, people don't buy either political party now.
[03:25:44.746 --> 03:25:54.534]  They're finally shattering the left-right paradigm in a very, very big way.
[03:25:54.534 --> 03:25:56.776]  And the Democrats have now
[03:25:59.913 --> 03:26:02.554]  Seen the House and Senate versions that are in conference.
[03:26:02.554 --> 03:26:04.035]  Both are very bad.
[03:26:04.035 --> 03:26:11.518]  Jail time, five years in prison, quarter million dollar fines if you don't buy the insurance and they take money out of your check and they tax.
[03:26:11.518 --> 03:26:12.719]  Better insurance plans.
[03:26:12.719 --> 03:26:14.480]  You know they'll phase that into everything.
[03:26:14.480 --> 03:26:16.381]  Plus it's unconstitutional.
[03:26:16.381 --> 03:26:18.862]  It's discriminatory.
[03:26:18.862 --> 03:26:20.743]  Both versions of the bill and they're leaving it in.
[03:26:20.743 --> 03:26:21.223]  They're saying
[03:26:21.923 --> 03:26:24.526]  Leave certain states out.
[03:26:24.526 --> 03:26:27.308]  Leave scores of big labor unions out.
[03:26:27.308 --> 03:26:28.890]  Their employees don't have to do this.
[03:26:28.890 --> 03:26:30.251]  The rest of the public does.
[03:26:30.251 --> 03:26:37.538]  They become like little lords and little duchesses and little dukes and little kings, where it's all selectively done.
[03:26:37.538 --> 03:26:39.240]  We saw that with Obama.
[03:26:39.240 --> 03:26:43.664]  If you were a Democratic contributor, you got to keep your General Motors car dealership.
[03:26:43.664 --> 03:26:44.605]  If you weren't, you didn't.
[03:26:44.605 --> 03:26:46.046]  That came out on the House floor.
[03:26:46.817 --> 03:26:48.498]  And that's public.
[03:26:48.498 --> 03:26:53.721]  If you're a globalist and contributed, he'd give you billions to move the factories overseas.
[03:26:53.721 --> 03:27:04.386]  And it's been like this with presidents before him the last few decades, but it's now coming to a head because they're going for broke and they don't care.
[03:27:04.386 --> 03:27:09.188]  And this bill raises taxes by at least $500 billion in the next 10 years.
[03:27:09.188 --> 03:27:09.969]  That's conservative.
[03:27:09.969 --> 03:27:11.910]  It's more like $700 billion they're reporting.
[03:27:13.540 --> 03:27:17.161]  41 billion Medicare cuts, 30-something billion Medicaid cuts every year.
[03:27:17.161 --> 03:27:19.121]  The taxes go up, the benefits go down.
[03:27:19.121 --> 03:27:24.422]  It gives immunity to the insurance companies and doctors and big HMOs to not give you care.
[03:27:24.422 --> 03:27:30.303]  So it has the government coming in with these panels of non-doctors deciding and setting policy for everyone.
[03:27:30.303 --> 03:27:31.343]  We've seen it in Canada.
[03:27:31.343 --> 03:27:34.824]  We've seen it in England, where you get rationed for health care.
[03:27:34.824 --> 03:27:36.344]  Tom Daschle wrote the original bill.
[03:27:36.344 --> 03:27:38.844]  He wrote a book calling for it.
[03:27:38.844 --> 03:27:40.305]  I mean, this is the reality.
[03:27:40.305 --> 03:27:41.825]  This legislation is bad.
[03:27:43.431 --> 03:27:47.434]  And, I mean, to say bad, that's not even a strong enough word.
[03:27:47.434 --> 03:27:53.239]  But then we have the Associated Press, where other labor unions that aren't exempted from it, they're getting angry.
[03:27:53.239 --> 03:28:00.545]  They were fine with something immoral for other people, other businesses, corporations, private companies, private individuals.
[03:28:00.545 --> 03:28:02.627]  But they don't like it that they're not exempt.
[03:28:05.450 --> 03:28:08.632]  Labor angry over Obama-backed insurance tax.
[03:28:08.632 --> 03:28:18.717]  Labor leaders are pushing hard on President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats to drop a proposed new tax on high-value health care plans, warning of politicians and political consequences.
[03:28:18.717 --> 03:28:25.160]  The White House has indicated the tax may change, show it hits fewer workers, but it's not going away.
[03:28:25.160 --> 03:28:28.562]  And then now we've confirmed in conference they're just going to exempt some people from it.
[03:28:29.721 --> 03:28:31.441]  Continuing, raw story.
[03:28:31.441 --> 03:28:35.802]  Dodd, health reform bill hanging by a thread.
[03:28:35.802 --> 03:28:41.804]  And he goes into saying the Democratic Party, people are exiting it, they're panicking, it may not even pass.
[03:28:41.804 --> 03:28:48.226]  But see, they did that foregone conclusion, saying, oh, it will pass, no way to stop it, so you wouldn't lobby against it.
[03:28:48.226 --> 03:28:49.926]  But there's still time.
[03:28:49.926 --> 03:28:56.708]  The states also are saying they're going to fight it, it's unconstitutional, because certain states don't have to do it, other states do, the feds can't do that.
[03:28:56.708 --> 03:28:57.968]  That's up for states to decide.
[03:28:59.548 --> 03:29:04.610]  But the interesting thing is, you read these Democrats on Raw Story, and what are they all saying?
[03:29:04.610 --> 03:29:08.271]  This morning there was 30-something comments, 36 comments when I printed this.
[03:29:08.271 --> 03:29:12.613]  I'm sure there's more now, but I read every comment and they all disagreed.
[03:29:12.613 --> 03:29:16.555]  It's not just liberals and labor unions, it's everybody with an ounce of sense.
[03:29:16.555 --> 03:29:25.298]  This bill is so bad, if anyone can cause the Democratic Party to lose control of what they call control of the House and Senate.
[03:29:25.298 --> 03:29:29.180]  And it goes, if the Democrats pass this love gift to the health insurance industry and the Senate,
[03:29:30.782 --> 03:29:33.944]  They will lose massively in 2010.
[03:29:33.944 --> 03:29:37.627]  I'm a lifelong liberal and will not tolerate this sellout to big insurance.
[03:29:37.627 --> 03:29:40.609]  And it's the same thing on every stinking comment.
[03:29:40.609 --> 03:29:42.390]  They've broken the paradigm.
[03:29:42.390 --> 03:29:47.053]  They get, all they're going to get from Washington is rape and robbery and pillaging.
[03:29:47.053 --> 03:29:50.155]  No matter what party or what they do, it's all a scam.
[03:29:50.155 --> 03:29:52.176]  Stay with us.
[03:29:52.176 --> 03:29:53.577]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.577 --> 03:29:56.099]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.099 --> 03:29:58.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.513 --> 03:30:05.615]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:30:05.615 --> 03:30:08.496]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:08.496 --> 03:30:09.776]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:30:09.776 --> 03:30:10.576]  It's very real.
[03:30:10.576 --> 03:30:12.817]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:30:12.817 --> 03:30:14.478]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:31:03.384 --> 03:31:07.406]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.406 --> 03:31:10.668]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.668 --> 03:31:12.069]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.774 --> 03:31:15.456]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.456 --> 03:31:21.841]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.841 --> 03:31:26.885]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.885 --> 03:31:37.033]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:37.133 --> 03:31:39.474]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.474 --> 03:31:41.075]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:41.075 --> 03:31:43.536]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.536 --> 03:31:45.376]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.376 --> 03:31:50.799]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.799 --> 03:31:59.902]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:02.665 --> 03:32:05.689]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:32:05.689 --> 03:32:11.016]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:32:11.016 --> 03:32:13.059]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:32:13.059 --> 03:32:17.585]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:32:20.357 --> 03:32:20.857]  We're good.
[03:32:36.203 --> 03:32:37.303]  We're good to go!
[03:33:24.873 --> 03:33:31.761]  Coming up in the last segment, I'm going to post at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com some amazing new video.
[03:33:31.761 --> 03:33:35.406]  We can't play it on air, the audio, but we can play the video.
[03:33:35.406 --> 03:33:38.269]  So that is coming up.
[03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:39.551]  So stay with us for that.
[03:33:40.967 --> 03:33:50.950]  They said they were going to post it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I've seen the link from Prison Planet Paul Watson sent me, but I can't see it in the tiles of the top stories.
[03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:55.551]  So we'll try to get it up on InfoWars.com as well.
[03:33:55.551 --> 03:33:59.512]  Instead of using IM, I'd use telephone with the guys.
[03:33:59.512 --> 03:34:02.793]  Try to get some confirmation from them.
[03:34:02.793 --> 03:34:04.554]  People texting people.
[03:34:06.633 --> 03:34:15.240]  There's a report where children, teenagers only use 800 words a day now, when the average person uses tens of thousands.
[03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:18.342]  Children as young as three can't talk now in the U.S.
[03:34:18.342 --> 03:34:21.545]  and England from television and computers.
[03:34:21.545 --> 03:34:23.206]  And I've even caught it in my office now.
[03:34:23.206 --> 03:34:33.014]  Everyone just IMs and emails, and then stuff just falls through the cracks, where if people just pick up a telephone or talk face-to-face, there'd be clear communication on it.
[03:34:34.834 --> 03:34:36.237]  I'm not criticizing anybody.
[03:34:36.237 --> 03:34:44.291]  We also have a lot of remote people that work in other parts of England and New Mexico.
[03:34:44.291 --> 03:34:46.555]  Getting back to the news here.
[03:34:48.246 --> 03:34:56.174]  Dodd, health reform bill hanging by a thread, and the Democrats are properly addressing this.
[03:34:56.174 --> 03:34:59.337]  That is the Democrat constituents, people calling themselves liberals.
[03:34:59.337 --> 03:35:05.844]  They're saying it's a healthcare takeover, a scam, a fraud, a looting, raising taxes and cutting benefits.
[03:35:05.844 --> 03:35:10.168]  But of course, you never get something free when the government robs another group.
[03:35:10.168 --> 03:35:10.769]  They keep it.
[03:35:11.650 --> 03:35:12.791]  There is no free lunch.
[03:35:12.791 --> 03:35:13.651]  Don't you get it?
[03:35:13.651 --> 03:35:20.195]  Now, the right-wingers are attacking this from the wrong perspective, saying, it's commies that want to run our lives!
[03:35:20.195 --> 03:35:22.276]  Well, they want to run your lives, but they're not commies.
[03:35:22.276 --> 03:35:23.036]  They're big banks.
[03:35:23.036 --> 03:35:34.102]  They're big insurance companies who can go write unconstitutional legislation to make you buy their overpriced insurance, or put you in prison if you don't, and then cut the quality of your care.
[03:35:35.643 --> 03:35:39.326]  So the left's got it part right, the right's got it partly right.
[03:35:39.326 --> 03:35:41.889]  Ladies and gentlemen, get out of your left-right paradigm.
[03:35:41.889 --> 03:35:56.102]  But the good news is, Senator Dodd, who says he's leaving the Senate, says on his way out the door, retiring Senator Chris Dodd, has some bad news for health reform advocates still cheering the late December Senate vote.
[03:35:56.102 --> 03:35:57.984]  Health reform is hanging by a thread.
[03:35:59.645 --> 03:36:08.791]  And one or two votes could determine the outcome of the heavily debated bill, Democrat Senator Chris Dodd told CNBC Monday.
[03:36:08.791 --> 03:36:26.802]  The Cable Business News Network reports, Dodd said, you would have to be living on the moon not to know that senators have already gone on record with having issues with the plan, citing Nebraska's Ben Nelson, Connecticut's Joe Lieberman, and Senator Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas, because they know it's political suicide to go for it.
[03:36:27.282 --> 03:36:34.295]  Everyone feels, I guess, to some degree, who have been for this, that we would have liked something different.
[03:36:34.295 --> 03:36:38.422]  And that it's not uncommon when you're considering an issue of this magnitude, he said.
[03:36:40.040 --> 03:36:44.702]  If this is all about surviving politically, then we're missing the whole purpose of what we're supposed to be doing.
[03:36:44.702 --> 03:36:46.122]  Yeah, destroying America.
[03:36:46.122 --> 03:36:49.884]  So the point is, they all know that people are wise now.
[03:36:49.884 --> 03:36:52.185]  That's why they tried to keep the bill secret, remember?
[03:36:52.185 --> 03:36:55.986]  That's why it's in secret conference committee now, what they're doing with it.
[03:36:55.986 --> 03:37:00.028]  Our supposed free society, the immigration bill three years ago was secret.
[03:37:00.028 --> 03:37:03.249]  We got it, total amnesty even for felons.
[03:37:03.249 --> 03:37:07.271]  And they could bring in six of their family members.
[03:37:07.271 --> 03:37:07.991]  On and on and on.
[03:37:09.412 --> 03:37:10.632]  Everything is a fraud.
[03:37:10.632 --> 03:37:12.273]  No bid contracts.
[03:37:12.273 --> 03:37:17.415]  The media says, well, it should only be American companies that get the military contracts.
[03:37:17.415 --> 03:37:18.455]  That was a red herring.
[03:37:18.455 --> 03:37:20.396]  It was only American companies.
[03:37:20.396 --> 03:37:22.616]  It was no bid for other American companies.
[03:37:22.616 --> 03:37:25.677]  See, it's just, everything is spin and fraud.
[03:37:25.677 --> 03:37:37.561]  But the good news is, this giant lie is coming down on its head in a big way, and the people are finally getting it and finally understanding what's happening.
[03:37:38.846 --> 03:37:55.676]  On another issue of A Big Awakening that's taking place, we got the secret MIAC report and the Homeland Security report that listed gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans, libertarians, anti-Federal Reserve people as potential terrorists.
[03:37:55.676 --> 03:38:05.402]  There's a big article Paul Watson wrote today at PrisonPlanet.com, Obama's TSA nominee targets anti-government Christians.
[03:38:05.402 --> 03:38:07.924]  Targets anti-government Christians.
[03:38:09.457 --> 03:38:12.620]  And then it has the video clip of him saying it.
[03:38:12.620 --> 03:38:16.923]  And it's got him in his TSA uniform down at the bottom.
[03:38:16.923 --> 03:38:20.406]  I'm trying to pull that article up and see if we can.
[03:38:20.406 --> 03:38:23.169]  Obama's TSA nominee targets anti-government Christians.
[03:38:23.169 --> 03:38:28.653]  So we can just show people the image of this guy before the show ends.
[03:38:28.653 --> 03:38:33.397]  And they are mixing in people that don't want bigger government, Christians,
[03:38:34.298 --> 03:38:40.139]  Just like Janet Reno told 60 Minutes, people who believe in a second coming of Christ are mentally ill cult members and terrorists.
[03:38:40.139 --> 03:38:42.120]  I mean, that's a quote.
[03:38:42.120 --> 03:38:43.460]  These people are the weirdos.
[03:38:43.460 --> 03:38:49.681]  These people are the ones that want to demonize freedom of religion and assembly in this country.
[03:38:49.681 --> 03:38:56.463]  And he says the main focus is on Christian conservatives.
[03:38:56.463 --> 03:39:00.664]  So, I mean, these guys are just right out in the open.
[03:39:01.914 --> 03:39:06.657]  Also, government documents have been released by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, EPIC.
[03:39:06.657 --> 03:39:12.120]  And Mike Adams at Natural News, we have this up on InfoWars.com, reports TSA lies exposed.
[03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:16.603]  Full-body scanner machines do save and transmit images of your body.
[03:39:16.603 --> 03:39:18.384]  Secret documents reveal.
[03:39:18.384 --> 03:39:19.885]  Well, of course!
[03:39:19.885 --> 03:39:21.946]  That's how the government's posting and sharing these.
[03:39:21.946 --> 03:39:23.427]  They say they record your body.
[03:39:23.427 --> 03:39:25.448]  They biometrically scan you.
[03:39:25.448 --> 03:39:29.371]  So I thought I would get into that.
[03:39:29.371 --> 03:39:31.252]  Also on the war front, a huge
[03:39:32.708 --> 03:39:43.353]  Provocation against Iran, who's already under sanctions, already had our government illegitimately overthrow their government several times, using radical Muslims to do it.
[03:39:43.353 --> 03:39:48.655]  General Petraeus goes on CNN and says, Iran can be bombed, says General Petraeus, and they may do it.
[03:39:48.655 --> 03:39:54.538]  That's not a general's place to be on CNN in a highly scripted show with Wolf Blitzer talking about that.
[03:39:54.538 --> 03:39:56.559]  It's outrageous!
[03:39:56.559 --> 03:40:02.242]  Alright, now getting into the banker bailout that's taking place.
[03:40:03.715 --> 03:40:05.157]  This is not a bailout.
[03:40:05.157 --> 03:40:06.960]  It is a banking takeover.
[03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:18.517]  And with BankerGate that we covered extensively yesterday and we wrote key articles on the sites about, I think the most comprehensive out there by Paul Watson, Steve Watson, and Curt Nemo, they all published reports yesterday, worked tirelessly.
[03:40:20.011 --> 03:40:22.492]  To go over all the facets of the criminality.
[03:40:22.492 --> 03:40:25.133]  We need to get those reports out to everybody.
[03:40:25.133 --> 03:40:28.013]  Ron Paul, Geithner should be fired over BankerGate.
[03:40:28.013 --> 03:40:29.914]  That's one by Paul Watson.
[03:40:29.914 --> 03:40:31.214]  Here's another one by Steve Watson.
[03:40:31.214 --> 03:40:35.936]  BankerGate emails expose criminal financial dictatorship at work.
[03:40:35.936 --> 03:40:42.198]  And again, Kurt filed another report with BankerGate in the title you need to read and get out to everybody.
[03:40:42.198 --> 03:40:43.238]  This is so important.
[03:40:45.050 --> 03:40:59.614]  That people be made aware of this, because people know the banks are ripping them off, but they don't understand the full magnitude of crimes committed by Geithner and others on the surface, keeping it secret that they were being paid themselves, personally, the banker bailout money.
[03:40:59.614 --> 03:41:04.396]  The Federal Reserve people, and the private group, and the governmental Treasury Department.
[03:41:05.663 --> 03:41:07.525]  And here's what the mainstream media says.
[03:41:07.525 --> 03:41:08.766]  I mean, they admit what's happening.
[03:41:08.766 --> 03:41:12.109]  There's no longer any hiding it with over 20% real unemployment.
[03:41:12.109 --> 03:41:16.514]  America slides deeper into depression as Wall Street revels.
[03:41:16.514 --> 03:41:17.435]  That means parties.
[03:41:18.462 --> 03:41:19.924]  December was worst month for U.S.
[03:41:19.924 --> 03:41:22.107]  unemployment since the Great Depression began.
[03:41:22.107 --> 03:41:23.809]  London Guardian telling the truth.
[03:41:23.809 --> 03:41:25.251]  Business week.
[03:41:25.251 --> 03:41:27.814]  The disposable worker.
[03:41:27.814 --> 03:41:32.099]  Pay is falling, benefits are vanishing, and no one's job is secure.
[03:41:32.099 --> 03:41:37.206]  How companies are making the era of temp more than temporary.
[03:41:39.557 --> 03:41:46.683]  And it gets into how the real economy is dead as a doornail, but the banks say the economy's great because they're stealing all the money.
[03:41:46.683 --> 03:41:50.326]  Everything's being fed into their mouth, into their maw, into their jaws.
[03:41:50.326 --> 03:41:54.409]  Schwarzenegger budget acts would fall heavily on poor Reuters.
[03:41:54.409 --> 03:42:02.095]  See, they bankrupt California, now almost everything goes to interest on debt to private banks, and Schwarzenegger makes massive cuts to the poor.
[03:42:02.435 --> 03:42:08.538]  See, your whole beautiful welfare system that got everybody dependent, now they got North Common Homeland Security in place.
[03:42:08.538 --> 03:42:10.118]  They don't care if you riot now.
[03:42:10.118 --> 03:42:11.359]  They want you to riot.
[03:42:11.359 --> 03:42:12.999]  They're now going to bankrupt you.
[03:42:12.999 --> 03:42:17.821]  Then they're going to tax you if you have more than one child and pay you to be sterilized.
[03:42:17.821 --> 03:42:19.262]  That's what they're now openly announcing.
[03:42:19.262 --> 03:42:20.442]  They're pushing that now.
[03:42:20.442 --> 03:42:21.403]  That's the next phase.
[03:42:23.089 --> 03:42:25.290]  So over here on the document, Cam, I can show you a shot of this.
[03:42:25.290 --> 03:42:30.091]  Schwarzenegger budget acts would fall heavily on the poor.
[03:42:30.091 --> 03:42:40.534]  The latest budget plan from California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger would force 200,000 children off low-cost medical insurance and in-home care for 350,000 infirm and elderly citizens.
[03:42:40.534 --> 03:42:41.954]  Yeah, I gotta euthanize them.
[03:42:41.954 --> 03:42:44.515]  And slash income assistance to hundreds of thousands more.
[03:42:44.515 --> 03:42:46.595]  And see, conservatives will say, oh, that sounds great.
[03:42:46.595 --> 03:42:48.016]  Yeah, but how about we cut government?
[03:42:48.016 --> 03:42:48.136]  No.
[03:42:48.496 --> 03:42:51.817]  That's growing, growing, growing, growing like a cancer.
[03:42:51.817 --> 03:42:59.240]  And don't forget the NBC report, not the one where TSA agents are going crazy declaring themselves God.
[03:42:59.240 --> 03:43:08.143]  No, the other one this week, where they're telling California employees at the DMV, and now they're saying other agencies, you've got to work one day a week free.
[03:43:08.143 --> 03:43:09.384]  That's called slavery.
[03:43:09.384 --> 03:43:11.745]  See, you government people love sucking off the public.
[03:43:11.745 --> 03:43:13.085]  You love your largesse.
[03:43:13.085 --> 03:43:14.366]  That's all going to end for you too.
[03:43:16.667 --> 03:43:17.728]  We'll be just like China.
[03:43:17.728 --> 03:43:21.390]  Corrupt Chinese officials pocket $50 billion.
[03:43:21.390 --> 03:43:26.873]  The media is reporting $50 billion that the bureaucrats have stolen from the people.
[03:43:26.873 --> 03:43:28.754]  That's what big government delivers.
[03:43:28.754 --> 03:43:30.935]  Here's another one about what big government's doing to you.
[03:43:30.935 --> 03:43:33.137]  Copenhagen summit turned junket.
[03:43:33.137 --> 03:43:35.198]  Exclusive CBS News.
[03:43:35.198 --> 03:43:41.742]  At least 20 members of Congress made the trip to ClimateGate conference in Copenhagen last month and the millions and millions of dollars they spent to do it.
[03:43:43.442 --> 03:43:45.964]  Here's that other article that I mentioned.
[03:43:45.964 --> 03:43:49.566]  Teenagers only use 800 different words a day.
[03:43:49.566 --> 03:43:53.128]  Many children ages 3 can't even talk.
[03:43:53.128 --> 03:43:55.089]  We're being turned into just mindless drones.
[03:43:55.089 --> 03:43:58.531]  Pretty soon if you can talk and tie your shoelaces, you'll be known as a genius.
[03:43:58.531 --> 03:44:00.212]  Their brains are so filled with mercury.
[03:44:00.212 --> 03:44:02.634]  The government thinks you're so dumb they tell you mercury's good for you.
[03:44:03.674 --> 03:44:06.716]  Ed Brown receives virtual death sentence for resisting government.
[03:44:06.716 --> 03:44:08.757]  Curt Nemo, Infowars.com.
[03:44:08.757 --> 03:44:09.518]  All the details there.
[03:44:09.518 --> 03:44:11.639]  37 years in prison.
[03:44:11.639 --> 03:44:15.162]  He'd be over 107 years old when he gets out.
[03:44:15.162 --> 03:44:19.524]  He usually served 90 plus percent, about 92 percent of a federal sentence.
[03:44:19.524 --> 03:44:22.546]  So that means he'll be about 100 years old or more when he gets out.
[03:44:22.546 --> 03:44:24.007]  Just absolutely criminal.
[03:44:24.007 --> 03:44:26.148]  But meanwhile, Geithner doesn't have to pay his taxes.
[03:44:26.148 --> 03:44:31.332]  It can steal 220-something trillion billion in front of everybody.
[03:44:32.479 --> 03:44:33.540]  I don't
[03:44:54.725 --> 03:45:00.928]  You know, saying something mildly that can be called racist and then having to step down as leadership in the Senate.
[03:45:00.928 --> 03:45:03.369]  Now Harry Reid, I don't like Harry Reid.
[03:45:03.369 --> 03:45:04.110]  I hate his guts.
[03:45:04.110 --> 03:45:06.791]  He's a very wicked globalist robbing us.
[03:45:06.791 --> 03:45:09.773]  He comes out, and this has been the big news the last four or five days.
[03:45:09.773 --> 03:45:12.674]  I haven't covered it, but I want to mention it now.
[03:45:12.674 --> 03:45:13.975]  Harry Reid comes out.
[03:45:16.024 --> 03:45:19.348]  And it gets released in a big book that he said, oh, it's great.
[03:45:19.348 --> 03:45:25.654]  You know, Americans wouldn't vote for him, but he's light-skinned and doesn't have an ethnic dialect.
[03:45:25.654 --> 03:45:27.416]  He was pushing Obama to run.
[03:45:27.416 --> 03:45:28.838]  He's Obama's friend.
[03:45:28.838 --> 03:45:35.145]  He's saying what he thinks of as racist America will go for Obama.
[03:45:35.145 --> 03:45:36.726]  And it was Reid that got him to do it.
[03:45:37.725 --> 03:45:45.268]  But see, that's just a political football meant to train Republicans to support political correctness, to rush in and call for his head.
[03:45:45.268 --> 03:45:47.869]  No, Lott shouldn't have to step down.
[03:45:47.869 --> 03:45:51.911]  He should step down because he's a crook, but not for that reason.
[03:45:51.911 --> 03:45:54.752]  And Reid shouldn't have to step down for that.
[03:45:54.752 --> 03:45:58.193]  He should step down because he's a crook violating Senate rules and the Constitution.
[03:45:58.193 --> 03:46:07.197]  But see, that's how they train you to accept political correctness in all of this, is by having Republicans now enforce it on Harry Reid.
[03:46:09.321 --> 03:46:10.804]  So that's going on there.
[03:46:10.804 --> 03:46:14.270]  Republicans cite Lott in calling for Reid to quit.
[03:46:14.270 --> 03:46:21.403]  Now, the other big issue is what happened with Flugate.
[03:46:21.403 --> 03:46:22.345]  And it is Flugate.
[03:46:23.939 --> 03:46:27.241]  The head of the EU Health Council has admitted they were lied to.
[03:46:27.241 --> 03:46:29.162]  They were told tens of millions would die.
[03:46:29.162 --> 03:46:37.326]  It was all a fraud by big government for a power grab with pharmaceutical makers to make tens of billions of dollars with the big five makers.
[03:46:37.326 --> 03:46:39.927]  They lied.
[03:46:39.927 --> 03:46:42.829]  In these reports, the EU Health Chief, he'll get in trouble now.
[03:46:42.829 --> 03:46:43.109]  Watch.
[03:46:43.942 --> 03:46:49.203]  Since it's a dangerous vaccine, the German government wouldn't even take it themselves, remember that.
[03:46:49.203 --> 03:47:02.887]  Everything we told you about how it was a fraud, how it was a scam, how the vaccine was dangerous, how the government was quietly getting ready before April, before you heard anything about flu, to push this hype, we knew they were getting ready for that, so we warned the public.
[03:47:03.527 --> 03:47:11.994]  Everything we've said has now been completely proven for all these talk show hosts like Dr. Dina Dell that say the vaccine's safe and everybody needs to take it and it's not hype.
[03:47:11.994 --> 03:47:13.635]  That's been totally disproven.
[03:47:13.635 --> 03:47:19.619]  Everybody in your family who got in your face and said you better take it, give them the BBC reports, the Al Jazeera video reports.
[03:47:19.619 --> 03:47:21.961]  I'm going to play that at the start of the rebroadcast.
[03:47:21.961 --> 03:47:24.583]  At the start of the show, we played that Al Jazeera report.
[03:47:24.583 --> 03:47:26.965]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:47:26.965 --> 03:47:32.790]  We have been proven absolutely correct, absolutely right on all of this.
[03:47:33.530 --> 03:47:35.291]  We know how the globalists operate.
[03:47:35.291 --> 03:47:37.072]  We know how their programs operate.
[03:47:37.072 --> 03:47:38.432]  We know what they do.
[03:47:38.432 --> 03:47:39.473]  We know their systems.
[03:47:39.473 --> 03:47:41.034]  We know their scams.
[03:47:41.034 --> 03:47:49.398]  And more and more people are listening to what we have to say and realizing that we've been telling people the truth all along and that we really know what we're talking about.
[03:47:49.398 --> 03:47:50.218]  Are we perfect?
[03:47:50.218 --> 03:47:50.658]  No.
[03:47:50.658 --> 03:47:51.659]  Do we make mistakes?
[03:47:51.659 --> 03:47:52.479]  Yes.
[03:47:52.479 --> 03:47:59.963]  But do we have the best handle on what's going on of any news websites or any radio show or any documentary filmmakers?
[03:48:00.643 --> 03:48:03.585]  We are the number one leaders of alternative news.
[03:48:03.585 --> 03:48:09.528]  Infowars.com is the biggest alternative news site on the web by Alexa and all the rating services.
[03:48:09.528 --> 03:48:11.129]  PrisonPlanet.com is number two.
[03:48:12.110 --> 03:48:14.071]  We have both the top spots.
[03:48:14.071 --> 03:48:19.475]  We are the leaders and the most successful viral video makers, period.
[03:48:19.475 --> 03:48:26.340]  Obama Deception, conservatively over 20 million people watched it three months ago, and I checked the numbers, for free online.
[03:48:26.340 --> 03:48:28.422]  It's over 4 million that we know of.
[03:48:28.422 --> 03:48:30.403]  With Follow the Republic, free online.
[03:48:30.403 --> 03:48:35.246]  People have gotten the thousands of DVDs from us, made hundreds of thousands of millions of copies.
[03:48:35.246 --> 03:48:39.890]  One university, over 30,000 were handed out by the great folks at Freedoms Phoenix there.
[03:48:40.902 --> 03:48:54.128]  The point is, we are having a huge effect, and that's why Kay Bailey Hutchinson is running videos like the one we're about to play, and it just has text over traffic sounds, so I will narrate for radio listeners.
[03:48:54.128 --> 03:49:06.574]  She now is having to come out with an anti-New World Order piece about toll roads as a land grab to try to beat Perry when she's even more involved, and I'm not saying I'm going to vote for Perry either, lesser of two evils.
[03:49:08.584 --> 03:49:14.206]  The point is, they are in total panic mode as all this information becomes mainstream.
[03:49:14.206 --> 03:49:20.749]  They're having to take on our political coloration of patriots and liberty people to try to win.
[03:49:20.749 --> 03:49:22.309]  And people are seeing through that.
[03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:36.615]  So, here is Bilderberg Group Steering Committee member, Kay Bailey Hutchinson's TV ad.
[03:49:36.615 --> 03:49:37.455]  It's a great ad.
[03:49:38.385 --> 03:49:47.896]  It's got images of those highway signs where they talk about it being a land grab, a foreign company.
[03:49:49.597 --> 03:49:51.198]  Toll roads.
[03:49:51.198 --> 03:49:53.681]  It's time to end the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[03:49:53.681 --> 03:49:56.423]  And see, they said last year, oh, we've cancelled it.
[03:49:56.423 --> 03:49:57.724]  But they're continuing the whole thing.
[03:49:57.724 --> 03:50:00.626]  They're just not calling it Trans-Texas Corridor.
[03:50:00.626 --> 03:50:10.235]  The AP had the headline saying that, oh, it's been cancelled, but then saying three paragraphs later, oh, but Rick Perry's renaming it something else.
[03:50:10.235 --> 03:50:11.055]  Play the video again.
[03:50:11.055 --> 03:50:13.978]  I want to try to read as much of that as I can for radio listeners.
[03:50:16.721 --> 03:50:19.403]  This is a free road.
[03:50:19.403 --> 03:50:21.545]  For now.
[03:50:21.545 --> 03:50:24.987]  Rick Perry wants it to be a toll road.
[03:50:24.987 --> 03:50:28.150]  The road your taxes already paid for.
[03:50:28.150 --> 03:50:30.531]  A giant Perry land grab.
[03:50:30.531 --> 03:50:34.094]  Like the 600,000 acres he tried to take from Texans.
[03:50:34.094 --> 03:50:38.337]  So a foreign company could charge tolls too.
[03:50:38.337 --> 03:50:40.198]  It's time to end the trans-Texas corridor.
[03:50:41.192 --> 03:50:42.853]  Paid for by Kay Bailey Hutchinson.
[03:50:42.853 --> 03:50:45.875]  But she doesn't tell you she works for the very same globalist.
[03:50:45.875 --> 03:50:48.377]  She doesn't tell you she's been involved in this whole program.
[03:50:48.377 --> 03:50:54.381]  She doesn't tell you it's a larger nationwide land grab under the NAFTA superhighway system.
[03:50:54.381 --> 03:50:57.163]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the key video.
[03:50:57.163 --> 03:50:57.664]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.134 --> 03:51:05.739]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[03:51:05.739 --> 03:51:12.187]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[03:51:12.187 --> 03:51:12.668]  Why?
[03:51:12.668 --> 03:51:14.691]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[03:51:14.691 --> 03:51:17.735]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[03:51:17.995 --> 03:51:22.417]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[03:51:22.417 --> 03:51:26.078]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[03:51:26.078 --> 03:51:31.820]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[03:51:31.820 --> 03:51:37.622]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers.
[03:51:37.842 --> 03:51:38.202]  I think so.
[03:52:03.254 --> 03:52:07.264]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.264 --> 03:52:10.532]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.532 --> 03:52:11.935]  Is it finishing off this agenda?
[03:52:12.637 --> 03:52:15.299]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.299 --> 03:52:21.705]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.705 --> 03:52:26.889]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.889 --> 03:52:36.897]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.997 --> 03:52:39.339]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.339 --> 03:52:40.940]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.940 --> 03:52:43.383]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.383 --> 03:52:45.504]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.504 --> 03:52:50.669]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.669 --> 03:52:59.777]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:03.996 --> 03:53:05.216]  This is not a drill.
[03:53:05.216 --> 03:53:07.737]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:53:07.737 --> 03:53:09.618]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[03:53:09.618 --> 03:53:16.841]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[03:53:16.841 --> 03:53:21.242]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[03:53:21.242 --> 03:53:31.566]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[03:53:31.766 --> 03:53:33.387]  Under any circumstance.
[03:53:33.387 --> 03:53:40.591]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[03:53:40.591 --> 03:53:41.272]  But listen up.
[03:53:41.272 --> 03:53:47.535]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[03:53:47.535 --> 03:53:49.376]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[03:53:49.376 --> 03:53:51.538]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[03:53:51.538 --> 03:53:52.058]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[03:53:52.058 --> 03:53:55.120]  Before they come for your guns, hideyourguns.com right now.
[03:54:06.886 --> 03:54:13.689]  Okay, one of our listeners on the 8th sent us the raw video of this as a link.
[03:54:13.689 --> 03:54:15.410]  It was not on the web.
[03:54:15.410 --> 03:54:22.994]  My crew is so overworked and distracted, they didn't bring it to my attention until this morning when it went on YouTube.
[03:54:22.994 --> 03:54:27.616]  But we are going to get the guy that confronted him on the show tomorrow.
[03:54:27.616 --> 03:54:30.458]  But it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:30.458 --> 03:54:33.099]  F you angry man swears at George H.W.
[03:54:33.099 --> 03:54:35.300]  Bush at Houston Restaurant.
[03:54:37.669 --> 03:54:45.012]  And my issue is this shows the boldness of the people and it is H.W.
[03:54:45.012 --> 03:54:45.352]  Bush.
[03:54:45.352 --> 03:54:47.933]  We're going to show you a still shot here of him.
[03:54:47.933 --> 03:54:53.134]  But if you go to PrisonPlanet.com, this just went up a few hours ago, we have it.
[03:54:53.134 --> 03:54:55.055]  And it's also up on Infowars.com.
[03:54:55.055 --> 03:54:57.076]  The article is, F.U.
[03:54:57.076 --> 03:54:58.976]  Angry Man Swears at George H.W.
[03:54:58.976 --> 03:54:59.917]  Bush.
[03:54:59.917 --> 03:55:03.818]  And without the audio, we'll play some of this video at a pizza place.
[03:55:05.165 --> 03:55:08.586]  And I want to warn this guy when he gets on the show with us.
[03:55:08.586 --> 03:55:12.567]  The Bushes don't usually have you taken out.
[03:55:12.567 --> 03:55:15.688]  Unless you personally get in their face.
[03:55:15.688 --> 03:55:25.310]  And I've done it to George W. Bush, and he had me arrested, my arm almost ripped off by the police, for simply at a press conference asking him a question about the New World Order.
[03:55:25.310 --> 03:55:31.412]  And so this guy has, there he is in the green, in the green over there.
[03:55:31.412 --> 03:55:31.852]  That's the
[03:55:34.121 --> 03:55:37.684]  What, was that Bush 42?
[03:55:37.684 --> 03:55:41.167]  Because Clinton was 40, no, no, that'd be Bush 41.
[03:55:41.167 --> 03:55:47.251]  Bush 41, then it was Clinton, then it was Bush, then it was Obama, Obama's 44.
[03:55:47.251 --> 03:55:52.596]  So that'd be Bush 41.
[03:55:52.596 --> 03:56:00.522]  So George Bush Sr., in a little pizza place, wanting to get some pizza, being confronted, and the guy confronts him about all the wars he launched, all the people,
[03:56:01.820 --> 03:56:03.121]  That his new world order is killed.
[03:56:03.121 --> 03:56:09.985]  And that's why the globalists want this cashless society control grid in place.
[03:56:09.985 --> 03:56:22.452]  They want this cashless society control grid in place because they want to be able to track, control everybody so they can carry out their crimes against humanity and so the slaves can't even speak up against them.
[03:56:22.452 --> 03:56:28.275]  But we're going to call this fella that sent us this, I guess, four or five days ago,
[03:56:29.969 --> 03:56:30.089]  Yes.
[03:56:50.589 --> 03:56:53.990]  Spun out with all this news here towards the end of the show.
[03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:56.331]  There's just so much happening, so much going on.
[03:56:56.331 --> 03:57:01.493]  I want to commend the crew for the great job that they have been doing.
[03:57:01.493 --> 03:57:10.436]  I want to commend all the AM and FM affiliates, Shortwave, Satellite, Internet, our IT people, our back office, the sales guys, everybody that makes this radio show possible.
[03:57:12.879 --> 03:57:22.004]  And I want to invite you to tune in at the very start of the show and the rebroadcast on the internet streams at InfoWars.com if you want to hear that and see that Al Jazeera piece.
[03:57:22.004 --> 03:57:26.327]  But it's BBC2 openly exposing the fraud of the flu shots.
[03:57:26.327 --> 03:57:36.813]  Any of you who were doubting this was all a made-up fraud, it's now come out that it's a made-up fraud from the highest levels of the EU, that the UN World Health Organization did this.
[03:57:38.539 --> 03:57:41.020]  Also, another activist tool isn't just my films.

[03:57:57.848 --> 03:58:01.391]  That deal ends this Friday evening.
[03:58:01.391 --> 03:58:09.476]  The year-end special slash New Year's special we always do in December and part of January ends this Friday if you want to be a PrisonPlanet.tv member.

[03:58:51.769 --> 03:58:56.312]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:56.312 --> 03:58:57.232]  Number one.
[03:58:57.232 --> 03:59:00.655]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.655 --> 03:59:01.515]  Number two.
[03:59:01.515 --> 03:59:06.418]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.418 --> 03:59:07.159]  It's true.
[03:59:07.159 --> 03:59:12.022]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:12.022 --> 03:59:12.862]  Number three.
[03:59:12.862 --> 03:59:16.445]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:16.445 --> 03:59:20.147]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:20.347 --> 03:59:21.128]  Number 4.
[03:59:21.128 --> 03:59:23.910]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:23.910 --> 03:59:27.573]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:27.573 --> 03:59:28.373]  Number 5.
[03:59:28.373 --> 03:59:32.516]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:32.516 --> 03:59:37.280]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:59:37.580 --> 03:59:41.724]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
