[00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:09.828]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.828 --> 00:00:11.409]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:12.970]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.134]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:21.198]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:34.202]  Coming up in the second hour, we have Kathryn Austin Fitts joining us today to talk about the economy, the latest developments with the Iran situation.
[00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:36.443]  Always insightful and informative.
[00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:40.584]  We're going to have open phones in the first, second, and third hour today.
[00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:51.729]  The toll-free number to join us on any of the issues I raise or any news items you want to talk about or questions or comments you have, 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, on this Tuesday, the 24th day of August, 2010 Transmission.
[00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.591]  Okay, I always attempt to do this and I'm never successful because I'll start covering one article
[00:01:09.264 --> 00:01:13.105]  Meaning just to go over the headlines and then I'll get bogged down on one story.
[00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:21.687]  Let me just attempt to go over the stacks of news that I have here in front of me.
[00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:25.508]  Here is the police state biometric grid stack.
[00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:29.489]  Fingerprint check-in tried at 24-hour fitness.
[00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:30.429]  You must thumbprint.
[00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:38.209]  Canada considers tracking devices for students.
[00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.909]  RFID.
[00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.370]  Other schools are already doing it.
[00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.912]  Biometric iris scanning technology rolled out across entire city.
[00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:50.112]  And they say it'll be worldwide in the next 10 years.
[00:01:50.112 --> 00:01:52.353]  You'll have to retina scan to buy and sell.
[00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:55.154]  Germany to roll out ID cards with embedded RFID.
[00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:02.534]  That's just some of the news we have on that front.
[00:02:02.534 --> 00:02:07.998]  Also, Apple patent targets iPhone thieves, but jailbreakers, too.
[00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:10.600]  What's a jailbreaker?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.624]  Anyone that puts a program on the iPhone that's not authorized, or in the case of my wife,
[00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:21.972]  I don't
[00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:39.407]  PC World's reporting that Apple will just remotely break into your phone.
[00:02:39.407 --> 00:03:00.154]  That means they're surveilling what's on your phone, they admit they are, and that if they see you download a program that's not authorized, or if you jailbreak the iPhone or iPad, but in the case of cell phone service, the iPhone, to where you can get another cell phone service other than AT&T.
[00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:01.875]  You buy the phone, you go out,
[00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:09.393]  You break the software on it that doesn't let you get another phone service.
[00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:18.877]  You go out and get another phone service, Verizon or something else, they can come in and kill your phone or take it over or wipe your phone.
[00:03:18.877 --> 00:03:22.598]  So just more evidence of control on that front.
[00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:30.332]  Also, there's incredible new hype that I've become aware of, and Matt Ryan was trying to tell me about this a few weeks ago.
[00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:34.755]  They actually posted a blurb about it on Infowars.com.
[00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:41.320]  Then I happened to see a newscast covering it this morning, and they're like, your computer is delivering hardcore drugs.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.162]  We need to have the police raid your home.
[00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:50.726]  If your children are listening to this type of music, or flashing lights on your computer, and then it cuts to,
[00:03:51.807 --> 00:04:00.333]  One of the old things I've seen for 15 years, where when you play audio on the web, it shows the swirling random patterns.
[00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:05.036]  And they said that's a hardcore drug and they want to pass laws to ban it.
[00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.917]  And here's USA Today.
[00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:10.640]  Web delivers new worry for parents.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.981]  Digital drugs.
[00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:15.217]  I did some research on it.
[00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:17.759]  It's total quackery.
[00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.521]  In fact, here's a big Australian newspaper.
[00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:23.603]  The iDrugs don't work.
[00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:24.603]  Internet drugs.
[00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:28.086]  Inexpensive digital drugs may sound a new alarm.
[00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:32.015]  And technically, there's some truth to this.
[00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:37.117]  It says they listen to this music and it uplifts them, it excites them.
[00:04:37.117 --> 00:04:40.139]  Well, what does Beethoven's Ninth Symphony do?
[00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.700]  If that floats your boat, it certainly does mine.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.322]  Or what does some ACDC do with its high energy?
[00:04:47.322 --> 00:04:52.105]  They're now saying it's a drug and the government's coming.
[00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:54.146]  So we'll cover that, a bunch of economic news.
[00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.507]  I'll break it all down on the other side.
[00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:59.988]  The news is getting crazier and crazier.
[00:04:59.988 --> 00:05:04.469]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[00:05:57.072 --> 00:05:58.813]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:04.250]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.170]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.592]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.592 --> 00:06:09.452]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:14.335]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:15.096]  It's true.
[00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:19.958]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:20.779]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.381]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:28.063]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.283 --> 00:06:29.063]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.063 --> 00:06:31.824]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:35.506]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.506 --> 00:06:36.306]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.306 --> 00:06:40.448]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.448 --> 00:06:45.490]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.671]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:51.472]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.472 --> 00:06:56.054]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:56.414]  877-327-0365.
[00:06:59.468 --> 00:07:03.671]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:10.076]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:17.462]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.462 --> 00:07:22.346]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:22.346 --> 00:07:24.488]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:35.253]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:42.016]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:42.016 --> 00:07:45.337]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:48.078 --> 00:07:48.578]  Thank you.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:31.483]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're watching the simulcast of the radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV, you are seeing the hardcore drugs.
[00:08:31.483 --> 00:08:37.145]  We are reportedly transmitting illegal drugs right now.
[00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:38.765]  It's techno music from the 1990s.
[00:08:40.726 --> 00:08:45.632]  Uh, with some pulsing, uh, snowflake images.
[00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:50.377]  And this is reportedly hardcore drugs.
[00:08:50.377 --> 00:08:55.704]  And the government wants to pass laws to ban what you're listening to right now.
[00:08:57.165 --> 00:08:59.947]  Here is the news articles.
[00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:01.388]  Here's USA Today.
[00:09:01.388 --> 00:09:03.609]  Give me a document cam shot, man.
[00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:09.933]  It says, Web delivers new worry for parents, digital drugs.
[00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:12.335]  USA Today.
[00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:13.516]  Here's another one.
[00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:15.097]  Richmond Times Dispatch.
[00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:18.799]  Inexpensive digital drugs may sound a new alarm.
[00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:21.221]  And then an Australian news report.
[00:09:22.884 --> 00:09:27.497]  Out of their technology section of stuff.co.nz, actually New Zealand.
[00:09:28.507 --> 00:09:33.409]  We've got a bunch of mainstream articles telling the truth, saying the iDrugs don't work.
[00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:34.470]  Internet drugs.
[00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.092]  But we've got all these newscasts about how incredibly dangerous it is.
[00:09:39.092 --> 00:09:39.772]  Here's one.
[00:09:39.772 --> 00:09:40.612]  iDosing.
[00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:43.434]  Can you get high off of digital drugs?
[00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:46.455]  This is a total media government hoax.
[00:09:46.455 --> 00:09:50.136]  We've got all these newscasts with cops saying we've got to do something about this.
[00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:52.498]  It could lead to harder drugs.
[00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:54.578]  We've got to check your computers.
[00:09:54.578 --> 00:09:55.339]  Well, what do you think
[00:09:56.099 --> 00:09:57.320]  I don't know.
[00:10:16.587 --> 00:10:30.250]  The majesty of being at the Grand Canyon on Christmas Day when we were camping as a child and walking out and seeing the little birds jumping around in the snow and the cold wind and the sun rising.
[00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.951]  Crisp and delicious.
[00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.191]  It's a drug, a natural drug.
[00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:35.312]  We know beauty.
[00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:36.292]  We know what's good.
[00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:48.245]  When you go watch your football team win or your soccer team, it stimulates natural endorphins because at a tribal level, you feel like your tribe has won.
[00:10:48.245 --> 00:10:49.485]  And what is the government saying?
[00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:52.007]  They want to give everyone forced vaccines.
[00:10:52.007 --> 00:11:00.212]  They have over a hundred of these that are now being tested and approved to quote, stop anxiety, stop emotion, stop stress.
[00:11:00.212 --> 00:11:03.294]  They want to put lithium in the water so you don't have anxiety.
[00:11:03.294 --> 00:11:04.835]  Anxiety is part of life.
[00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:06.636]  Are you eating a healthy diet?
[00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:07.718]  You drinking too much coffee?
[00:11:07.718 --> 00:11:12.604]  You know, they don't tell people don't give your kids soft drinks full of caffeine if they're hyper.
[00:11:12.604 --> 00:11:16.929]  Don't give them all these different dyes that admittedly are like amphetamines.
[00:11:16.929 --> 00:11:17.630]  No, no, no.
[00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:24.458]  Their answer is if your kid's hyper, put them on speed Adderall or Ritalin to burn out their brain.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.723]  Over time, it will burn them out, and they will be relaxed.
[00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:29.744]  Oh, you're a little depressed?
[00:11:29.744 --> 00:11:36.131]  Let's give you fluorine-based Prozac that admittedly massively increases mental illness and suicide.
[00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:39.614]  So, let's play this music again.
[00:11:39.614 --> 00:11:47.302]  This is one of the most popular videos concerning, you know, these eye drugs, and there's hundreds and hundreds of these on YouTube, and it's techno.
[00:11:47.927 --> 00:11:57.551]  I mean, I can't tell you in college how many clubs I went to, and yeah, you're jumping around, you're having a good time, and there's some truth to the flashing lights.
[00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:15.539]  The government admits that you go into a type of lower brain pattern, very suggestible subconsciously, associated with sleep or daydreaming, so they can program you when you're watching the flicker rate of television sets.
[00:12:16.119 --> 00:12:18.461]  So, in a way, there's some truth to this.
[00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:20.543]  Music is highly suggestible.
[00:12:20.543 --> 00:12:27.428]  That's why the Pentagon promotes hardcore heavy metal music and other things for the tank drivers and frontline combat troops.
[00:12:27.428 --> 00:12:30.671]  They've had PBS specials about that because it gets them fired up.
[00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:39.238]  That's why football teams in the locker room before the game and during halftime will play, you know, high-energy music.
[00:12:39.238 --> 00:12:40.078]  It's why they play
[00:12:41.299 --> 00:12:49.185]  You know, exciting music during the breaks at sporting events to keep people all amped up.
[00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.768]  But the government is now saying, this is a drug.
[00:12:52.768 --> 00:12:54.909]  Anything that can hype you up.
[00:12:54.909 --> 00:12:57.772]  And some people, it's George Strait.
[00:12:57.772 --> 00:12:59.333]  Some people, it's classical.
[00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:02.375]  Some people, it's rock and roll.
[00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:05.637]  People like myself, I mean, if it's good music, I like it all.
[00:13:05.637 --> 00:13:07.399]  But I particularly like classical.
[00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:13.731]  And so there's a small kernel of truth, but it's not a drug.
[00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:33.269]  It's inducing your body to produce endorphins because your soul, your intellect, the hard wiring of your electrochemical computer, the oil-based computer, that's what your brain is, it's over 70% water, but of the 25% or so that's solid, most of it is cholesterol.
[00:13:33.749 --> 00:13:39.733]  That's why they actually tell people that have seizures and epileptic problems to eat a high-fat diet.
[00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:42.855]  Because it's been shown in many studies for over 50 years to stabilize the brain.
[00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.756]  But they won't tell people that now.
[00:13:44.756 --> 00:13:49.560]  They tell them, let's give you some hardcore drugs so you won't have these seizures.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.442]  When a lot of times, a high-fat diet of the proper types of fat will help you.
[00:13:53.442 --> 00:13:55.704]  I mean, now is eating fat a drug?
[00:13:55.704 --> 00:13:58.145]  Because it increases brain activity.
[00:13:58.145 --> 00:13:59.966]  It increases connectivity.
[00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:02.948]  It increases the overall power of your mind.
[00:14:02.948 --> 00:14:03.249]  Fat.
[00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.738]  Especially things like fish oil.
[00:14:08.738 --> 00:14:13.948]  Notice they're trying to make everything illegal that is empowering the people.
[00:14:15.256 --> 00:14:20.419]  And I think that, you know, techno-type music is nothing but empowering.
[00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:23.201]  It's high-energy, it's pulsating.
[00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:35.388]  I mean, a lot of times I'll be up here late at night, and we're exhausted, and I'll say, hey, let's turn on some rock and roll, let's turn on some classical, let's turn on some techno, and, you know, put on some headphones and go walk around in the parking lot.
[00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:39.971]  You know, to get us jazzed back up so we can finish our work and keep our brains focused.
[00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:41.573]  Is that drugs?
[00:14:41.573 --> 00:14:42.513]  Am I on drugs?
[00:14:42.513 --> 00:14:44.195]  You better believe I'm on drugs.
[00:14:44.195 --> 00:14:47.477]  When I go in there and drink that coffee, that's a hardcore drug.
[00:14:47.477 --> 00:14:54.163]  But it's because it's a chemical going in, caffeine, and other things in the oils that are in coffee that also have an effect.
[00:14:54.163 --> 00:14:55.404]  It's not just the caffeine.
[00:14:55.404 --> 00:14:57.045]  But is listening to music a drug?
[00:14:57.045 --> 00:14:59.387]  Does the government need to get involved now?
[00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:11.975]  Cass Sunstein two years ago said that if you criticize and say man-made global warming isn't real, anthropogenic global warming, that you should be fined, feed, or maybe even arrested.
[00:15:11.975 --> 00:15:14.036]  And that blogs should be taxed.
[00:15:14.036 --> 00:15:18.538]  And now Philadelphia has launched a $300 tax on all free speech on the internet.
[00:15:18.538 --> 00:15:20.478]  You want to have your own personal blog?
[00:15:20.478 --> 00:15:22.099]  On Blogspot, you gotta pay them money.
[00:15:22.895 --> 00:15:27.459]  Well, here's The Guardian reporting on something that's been known for over 100 years.
[00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:35.385]  They've got studies for over 70 years in Scandinavia where for several months out of the year it's totally dark and the suicides go way up.
[00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:47.054]  They learned decades and decades and decades ago to have artificial sun lamps in the working areas and in the homes and to paint the walls white because your eyes are an extension of the brain.
[00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:56.080]  When you're gestating in your mother at a certain point, I think it's about a month in on average, the eyes grow out of the brain.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.864]  So the eyes are the window to the brain, to the soul, and they need sunlight.
[00:16:00.864 --> 00:16:07.869]  They need to see sunlight for dopamine levels and other natural chemicals in the brain.
[00:16:07.869 --> 00:16:09.791]  So sunlight is a drug.
[00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:11.612]  And what does Cass Sunstein say?
[00:16:11.612 --> 00:16:16.096]  He says it is a conspiracy theory to say that humans need any sunlight
[00:16:16.616 --> 00:16:19.217]  And we should stop people from getting sunlight.
[00:16:19.217 --> 00:16:21.077]  He's a eugenicist.
[00:16:21.077 --> 00:16:21.678]  Okay?
[00:16:21.678 --> 00:16:23.638]  He doesn't want you healthy and happy.
[00:16:23.638 --> 00:16:26.519]  And people say, well, I don't want to get a bunch of sun because I'll look old.
[00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:29.540]  Folks, you're meant to get old.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.181]  You are meant to have your skin get old.
[00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:36.722]  But by your skin burning, it gives you all of the different hormone releases
[00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:43.324]  Not just the vitamin D production that your entire body needs and it keeps your organs young.
[00:16:43.324 --> 00:16:48.965]  It massively decreases cancer in thousands of studies over the last hundred years.
[00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:52.446]  They had these studies in 1908, 1910, 1920s.
[00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:55.587]  But here's a whole new group of studies.
[00:16:55.587 --> 00:17:03.129]  MS and arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis may be linked to lack of sun, scientists say.
[00:17:03.129 --> 00:17:04.810]  Vitamin D found
[00:17:06.274 --> 00:17:06.434]  We're
[00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.312]  Darned if you do, darned if you don't.
[00:17:25.312 --> 00:17:39.444]  The optimum, and they have different statistics depending on your skin type, but you can look at the different studies, they vary, but someone who's a Northern European needs off and on about an hour of direct sunlight a week.
[00:17:39.444 --> 00:17:44.469]  Someone who has darker skin, who's more equatorial, may need upwards of 10 hours a week.
[00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:48.131]  I mean, you're supposed to have black skin if you've got black skin.
[00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:49.993]  You're designed for that.
[00:17:49.993 --> 00:17:51.213]  For your area of the world.
[00:17:51.213 --> 00:17:54.055]  If you've got brown skin, you're designed as you go higher up.
[00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:59.840]  If you've got white skin... Scientists have known for decades why people in Northern Hemisphere have blue eyes.
[00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:03.072]  It's because they allow more light in.
[00:18:03.072 --> 00:18:05.435]  People with blue eyes on average are more light sensitive.
[00:18:05.435 --> 00:18:07.237]  They have better night vision.
[00:18:07.237 --> 00:18:10.721]  Because your eyes are designed to suck in that light.
[00:18:10.721 --> 00:18:12.363]  To get that light.
[00:18:12.363 --> 00:18:17.209]  But if you have dark eyes, it's because you come from a more equatorial area, and it's designed to block it out.
[00:18:17.209 --> 00:18:19.692]  We're beautifully designed creatures.
[00:18:20.313 --> 00:18:29.237]  But here's Cass Sunstein saying, I don't care, there's a thousand studies with top scientists saying this stops cancer, it stops depression, it stops everything.
[00:18:29.237 --> 00:18:31.819]  They've got all these double-blind studies where they find St.
[00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:37.461]  John's Wort is many times better for you to stop depression than Prozac and that Prozac actually makes you depressed.
[00:18:37.461 --> 00:18:39.863]  But sunlight and exercise is even better.
[00:18:39.863 --> 00:18:46.326]  If I'm bummed out and tired and feel like crud and have been sick or whatever, I just go out, even if it's the winter.
[00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:56.491]  And I, even if it's, you know, 40 degrees, and I'll just get my underwear in the backyard and just lay there for an hour, shivering, and I just feel completely energized by the sun.
[00:18:56.491 --> 00:19:00.135]  Just like you're a plant, ladies and gentlemen, you need it.
[00:19:00.135 --> 00:19:01.096]  You need it.
[00:19:01.096 --> 00:19:02.779]  You need the sun.
[00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:03.940]  You don't need to be burned.
[00:19:04.881 --> 00:19:06.942]  If you get too much, you'll get skin cancer.
[00:19:06.942 --> 00:19:11.523]  But if you don't get any, your body shuts down.
[00:19:11.523 --> 00:19:12.944]  Your body shuts down.
[00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:14.684]  So, sunlight's a drug.
[00:19:14.684 --> 00:19:15.925]  Music's a drug.
[00:19:15.925 --> 00:19:17.465]  Getting excited's a drug.
[00:19:17.465 --> 00:19:18.886]  And they want to block all of that.
[00:19:18.886 --> 00:19:19.806]  It's not a drug.
[00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:21.306]  It's part of who we are.
[00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:22.447]  It's part of what we are.
[00:19:23.939 --> 00:19:37.694]  And it goes on, it says insufficient exposure to sunshine resulting in low levels of vitamin D can play a part in a wide range of diseases from multiple sclerosis to rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, some cancers and even dementia, scientists say.
[00:19:37.694 --> 00:19:44.541]  Well yeah, I mean they've done studies with prisoners again for close to 100 years about all the diseases that increase with prisoners not getting sun.
[00:19:45.222 --> 00:19:53.567]  That's why, if you go back to the whole prison sciences in France, more than 200 years ago they found to start getting people out to get some sun.
[00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:59.470]  Point is, I've already digressed, got a lot of other news coming up, but it is not a drug to listen to music or get sunlight.
[00:20:01.175 --> 00:20:05.856]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:01.524 --> 00:21:05.408]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:21:05.408 --> 00:21:06.809]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:10.693]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:21:10.693 --> 00:21:13.596]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:21:13.596 --> 00:21:15.679]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:17.821]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:19.022 --> 00:21:24.666]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:24.666 --> 00:21:27.168]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:36.794]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:21:36.794 --> 00:21:39.335]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[00:21:45.777 --> 00:21:46.418]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:22:04.893 --> 00:22:06.175]  Tyranny is here.
[00:22:06.175 --> 00:22:10.099]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:10.099 --> 00:22:12.322]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:12.322 --> 00:22:18.209]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:22:18.209 --> 00:22:24.436]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:30.841]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:30.841 --> 00:22:35.024]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:22:35.024 --> 00:22:39.307]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:39.307 --> 00:22:45.271]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:45.271 --> 00:22:48.814]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:48.814 --> 00:22:50.795]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:50.795 --> 00:22:51.236]  It's here.

[00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:02.648]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[00:23:02.648 --> 00:23:11.475]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:23.964]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[00:23:23.964 --> 00:23:24.865]  But don't wait!
[00:23:24.865 --> 00:23:27.847]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[00:23:27.927 --> 00:23:28.167]  I'm good.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.621]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[00:23:47.621 --> 00:23:49.402]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[00:23:49.402 --> 00:23:49.462]  800-876-2966.
[00:23:49.462 --> 00:23:49.662]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[00:23:49.662 --> 00:23:50.882]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:23:50.882 --> 00:23:52.383]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.012]  I was talking to John Harmon during the break.
[00:24:11.012 --> 00:24:13.415]  He can barely keep doing the show.
[00:24:13.415 --> 00:24:18.762]  He's so high off of that one minute of techno music we played on air.
[00:24:18.762 --> 00:24:22.026]  I mean, the government says they need to pass a law.
[00:24:22.026 --> 00:24:25.089]  We need to investigate what kids are watching.
[00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:26.731]  Music is mind control.
[00:24:27.412 --> 00:24:31.595]  And you do have quacks out there that are actually selling it, telling people it's a drug.
[00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:33.897]  And wow, the music's making me feel excited!
[00:24:33.897 --> 00:24:38.340]  You know, the government needs to get involved, and sunlight's a drug, and everything's a drug.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.902]  No, it's part of natural human life on this planet.
[00:24:41.902 --> 00:24:46.045]  John, how are you handling the hardcore techno music we played earlier?
[00:24:54.564 --> 00:24:59.149]  See, John's so high, he couldn't even turn his microphone up in Minnesota and get on air.
[00:24:59.149 --> 00:25:00.350]  John, are you okay?
[00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.612]  That stuff's pretty intense.
[00:25:01.612 --> 00:25:04.274]  I don't know if I can continue doing the show there, guys.
[00:25:04.274 --> 00:25:06.176]  See, you couldn't even get the microphone turned on.
[00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:06.957]  I couldn't.
[00:25:06.957 --> 00:25:07.518]  I couldn't.
[00:25:07.518 --> 00:25:09.700]  It's because of the intense, you know, drugs.
[00:25:11.084 --> 00:25:19.827]  What do you think about USA Today and others saying we may need a law to stop music where the government can ban whatever music it wants because it might excite people?
[00:25:19.827 --> 00:25:24.349]  Are you going to take the vaccine as soon as it comes out that stops all emotions?
[00:25:25.203 --> 00:25:26.184]  Absolutely not.
[00:25:26.184 --> 00:25:31.166]  It's just like these, you know, police state movies that try to make everything illegal.
[00:25:31.166 --> 00:25:35.869]  And any kind of good-feeling emotion is just going to be banned.
[00:25:35.869 --> 00:25:37.490]  It's called Al-Qaeda emotion.
[00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:38.230]  Exactly.
[00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.132]  Al-Qaeda may be using music to get our kids.
[00:25:41.132 --> 00:25:45.655]  Anything that you enjoy, eventually they'll tax or get rid of or ban.
[00:25:45.655 --> 00:25:46.935]  Well, because they're trying to save us.
[00:25:46.935 --> 00:25:50.097]  John, I appreciate you joining us, you drug addict.
[00:25:50.097 --> 00:25:50.737]  Thank you.
[00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:51.638]  I'm a drug addict, too.
[00:25:51.638 --> 00:25:52.859]  I mean, we listen to the music.
[00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:58.885]  I mean, you heard the techno that USA Today and others are saying we've got to ban it right now.
[00:25:58.885 --> 00:26:00.967]  Let's play some clips of some newscasts.
[00:26:00.967 --> 00:26:05.513]  Thank goodness they're on the job and they've got police officers saying this could lead to harder drugs.
[00:26:05.513 --> 00:26:08.196]  I mean, we've got kids listening to music, folks.
[00:26:08.196 --> 00:26:08.956]  This is dangerous.
[00:26:08.956 --> 00:26:09.297]  Here it is.
[00:26:10.198 --> 00:26:12.441]  ... against the latest internet craze.
[00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:13.302]  Have you ever heard of this?
[00:26:13.302 --> 00:26:15.304]  It's called iDosing.
[00:26:15.304 --> 00:26:24.095]  And websites are luring kids with free downloads of so-called digital drugs, which are audio files designed to induce drug-like effects.
[00:26:24.856 --> 00:26:29.439]  Adriana Iwaszynski has just returned from Mustang Live with the details on this alarming new trend.
[00:26:29.439 --> 00:26:31.241]  I've got to admit, I'd never heard of it before.
[00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:33.522]  Kelly, parents really need to listen up on this one.
[00:26:33.522 --> 00:26:40.367]  That's because all kids need to experience these digital drugs are headphones, their computer, and an mp3 player.
[00:26:40.367 --> 00:26:47.051]  Though the websites that tout them say they're a safe and legal way to get high, the theory is it could lead to illegal drug use.
[00:26:47.051 --> 00:26:47.532]  Oh yes!
[00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:54.597]  Digital drugs are all over the internet.
[00:26:54.597 --> 00:26:56.638]  Hit pause.
[00:26:56.638 --> 00:27:01.461]  Then they cut to YouTube videos with kids, teenagers, clearly screwing around.
[00:27:01.461 --> 00:27:03.702]  I've gone and watched some of the videos.
[00:27:03.702 --> 00:27:05.763]  They're like, oh my goodness, I'm high!
[00:27:05.763 --> 00:27:06.523]  Oh my goodness!
[00:27:06.523 --> 00:27:09.064]  Making fun of other newscasts.
[00:27:09.064 --> 00:27:11.946]  So, guys, go ahead and go back to that techno music for a minute.
[00:27:11.946 --> 00:27:13.567]  Let's play it and I'll act shilly.
[00:27:13.567 --> 00:27:15.948]  And then they can put it on the news that I'm really high.
[00:27:16.983 --> 00:27:29.726]  So teenagers are joking around listening to mild music, techno music, and the government is saying they want to come in and do something about it, and then they cut to police officers saying something must be done.
[00:27:29.726 --> 00:27:31.767]  Let's again play some of the devil music.
[00:27:31.767 --> 00:27:32.367]  Here it is right now.
[00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:49.916]  Oh no!
[00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:53.108]  I'm so high right now!
[00:27:53.108 --> 00:27:53.951]  The digital drugs!
[00:28:15.992 --> 00:28:24.798]  I can't control myself!
[00:28:24.798 --> 00:28:28.501]  I'm not happy because this is so stupid that I'm making fun of it and making a joke.
[00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.803]  No, I'm happy because of the devil music.
[00:28:31.803 --> 00:28:37.327]  This music has been specifically named by the media that you're listening to as a drug.
[00:28:38.047 --> 00:28:40.710]  And the police officers have got to do something now.
[00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:47.096]  Let's go back to the newscast, because all you need is an MP3 player and this music and headphones.
[00:28:47.096 --> 00:28:53.043]  I mean, you don't need a rubber band and a spoon and heroin and an injector.
[00:28:53.043 --> 00:28:55.105]  No, and Beethoven, it's even worse.
[00:28:55.105 --> 00:28:58.568]  Why, they played Beethoven's lovely, lovely Ninth.
[00:28:59.366 --> 00:29:01.650]  Why, it'd be like Clark Work Orange.
[00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:02.892]  I'd turn into Little Alex.
[00:29:02.892 --> 00:29:04.355]  I'd turn into a Droogie.
[00:29:04.355 --> 00:29:06.278]  I'd go out and commit crimes.
[00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:09.805]  Because I listen to lovely, lovely Ludwig's Nine.
[00:29:09.805 --> 00:29:10.285]  Here it is.
[00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:12.859]  Oh, look at them.
[00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:13.860]  They're under the mind control.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:19.142]  Digital drugs are all over the internet, touting a free, legal, safe way to get high.
[00:29:19.142 --> 00:29:20.723]  Oh my God.
[00:29:20.723 --> 00:29:24.444]  And images of teenagers trying it are all over YouTube.
[00:29:24.444 --> 00:29:31.507]  It's these images that has a lot of parents, educators, and law enforcement officials with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics concerned.
[00:29:31.507 --> 00:29:37.710]  Kids are going to flock to these sites just to see what it's about, and it can lead them other places.
[00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.991]  It sounds like this.
[00:29:40.484 --> 00:29:45.886]  ...and uses binaural or two-tone technology to alter your brain waves and mental state.
[00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:50.628]  Kelly Johnson is a parent in... We'll be right back, folks!

[00:31:59.696 --> 00:32:04.659]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:05.659]  What have we got?
[00:32:05.659 --> 00:32:08.100]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.101]  A republic.
[00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:11.762]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:32:11.762 --> 00:32:14.023]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:32:14.023 --> 00:32:16.044]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:32:16.044 --> 00:32:17.725]  So they think they own our land?
[00:32:17.725 --> 00:32:19.046]  They think they own our water?
[00:32:19.046 --> 00:32:19.646]  Children?
[00:32:19.646 --> 00:32:20.767]  Our education?
[00:32:20.767 --> 00:32:21.607]  Our money?
[00:32:21.607 --> 00:32:25.249]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:32:25.609 --> 00:32:30.595]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:32:30.595 --> 00:32:31.616]  We have the facts.
[00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:32.777]  We have the Constitution.
[00:32:32.777 --> 00:32:33.679]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:34.580]  We have common law.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.103]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:37.103 --> 00:32:40.867]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:32:41.067 --> 00:32:41.387]  Uh-oh!
[00:32:41.387 --> 00:32:41.868]  It's the cars!
[00:32:41.868 --> 00:32:42.308]  It's music!
[00:33:10.222 --> 00:33:15.329]  We've got to have the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics come arrest us.
[00:33:15.329 --> 00:33:16.451]  Listen to that music.
[00:33:16.451 --> 00:33:23.080]  It's horrible.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.163]  Alright, let's get serious.
[00:33:27.401 --> 00:33:31.486]  The crew tried to tell me about this a few weeks ago and I didn't really pay attention.
[00:33:31.486 --> 00:33:34.009]  Because it was so silly.
[00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:40.076]  But the point they were making was important that, hey, they're trying to push a new thing to outlaw music.
[00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:49.331]  And they go and use clips of kids joking around on the internet, and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:33:49.331 --> 00:34:01.020]  Now the media hypes that this is a hardcore drug and puts it out there, and then the kids make more videos joking about it, and then the media and the police actually believe it.
[00:34:02.213 --> 00:34:04.295]  But let's talk about something that's real.
[00:34:04.295 --> 00:34:22.490]  Back in the 1940s, this has of course been released back at the time, they would flash the image of a desert up during the movies with an image of a Coca-Cola, an ice-cold Coca-Cola dripping condensation.
[00:34:23.732 --> 00:34:24.112]  We're good.
[00:34:47.338 --> 00:34:53.104]  All these flashing images on television, that's why they will up the volume during commercials.
[00:34:53.104 --> 00:35:02.475]  Shopping malls nationwide, it's been admitted for more than 20 years, do have subliminal, relaxing music playing in the background.
[00:35:02.475 --> 00:35:04.817]  And you can't really call it mind control.
[00:35:05.838 --> 00:35:08.722]  Uh, casinos have been caught doing this.
[00:35:08.722 --> 00:35:10.904]  It's just a way to set the atmosphere.
[00:35:10.904 --> 00:35:23.460]  I mean, is it mind control when you go to a nice hotel and they have a bouquet of flowers that you can smell and the wood tables are all polished and there's marble floors and ornate paintings on the walls?
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.220]  Is that a drug?
[00:35:25.575 --> 00:35:29.696]  When you go and see a beautiful vista, like the Grand Canyon, is that a drug?
[00:35:29.696 --> 00:35:32.997]  When you go to the seashore and see a sunrise, is that a drug?
[00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:34.058]  No!
[00:35:34.058 --> 00:35:35.498]  We know what beauty is.
[00:35:35.498 --> 00:35:37.519]  We know what is good.
[00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:49.743]  When I'm driving through the countryside and I see beautiful little farms and rows of corn and wheat and a farmer on a red tractor, it just makes you feel good to see humans involved in agriculture.
[00:35:51.058 --> 00:35:54.563]  I mean, do goats, are goats under mind control?
[00:35:54.563 --> 00:36:02.515]  When they look across a valley and see green fields and they happily shake their tails and go down the hill and up the mountain to eat the grass?
[00:36:02.515 --> 00:36:06.721]  No, the grass looks good to them because their brain knows what is good!
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:23.064]  But when you go into a depressed neighborhood with crackheads and unhappy people and rundown houses and paint peeling off walls and poor children playing in mud puddles with scraggly clothes, you feel bad.
[00:36:23.064 --> 00:36:24.685]  It's not a drug.
[00:36:24.685 --> 00:36:27.706]  So they're literally trying to say, don't get sunlight.
[00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:28.726]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:36:28.726 --> 00:36:29.606]  It's good for you.
[00:36:29.606 --> 00:36:31.087]  When it's admitted, it's what you need.
[00:36:31.707 --> 00:36:36.672]  Or you'll get cancer and become depressed and get MS and so many other issues.
[00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:37.773]  They know this.
[00:36:37.773 --> 00:36:43.039]  Now they're trying to move to even send CPS after parents that let their kids get a suntan.
[00:36:44.816 --> 00:36:45.996]  All of this is happening.
[00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:58.418]  Meanwhile, they're putting sodium fluoride in the water that attacks every organ, reduces fertility or causes full sterilization, attacks all organs, more than doubles bone cancer in men and women, more than quadruples in young boys.
[00:36:58.418 --> 00:37:04.559]  They are wanting to put lithium, a toxic metal, in the water to perfect you so you're more passive.
[00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:07.040]  They want you to watch more television.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.100]  And there are literally scores of studies.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.841]  Here's one, BBC, from 2001.
[00:37:11.841 --> 00:37:13.921]  Just type in Alzheimer's television.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:23.633]  It's both the sedentary lifestyle and that it puts you into a sleep state and the average adult watches more than four and a half hours of television a day.
[00:37:24.824 --> 00:37:28.406]  More than four and a half hours of television a day.
[00:37:28.406 --> 00:37:33.508]  The youth are watching upwards of eight hours when you combine video games, and video games are even worse.
[00:37:33.508 --> 00:37:42.052]  For some reason, the concentration while you're in the lower brainwave state associated with sleep brings you actually into an unnatural level.
[00:37:42.052 --> 00:37:45.193]  This is major studies that have come out, even Wired Magazine's reported.
[00:37:45.193 --> 00:37:52.937]  When you play video games for a couple hours, you then go into a oxygen starved level that you only get in the deepest areas of sleep
[00:37:53.377 --> 00:37:53.797]  We're good to go.
[00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:25.315]  Freiland said watching TV was the only recreational activity out of those studies that Alzheimer's sufferers were more likely to participate in.
[00:38:25.315 --> 00:38:31.816]  And the studies also show when you're watching a lot of television, you're not outside, you're not getting fresh air, you're not getting sunlight.
[00:38:31.816 --> 00:38:34.577]  That's connected to dementia and Alzheimer's.
[00:38:34.577 --> 00:38:45.579]  In the new London Guardian report out today with a bunch of different scientific studies, insufficient exposure to sunshine resulting in low levels of vitamin D, that's only part of it.
[00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:57.593]  Plays a role in a wide range of diseases from multiple sclerosis to rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, cancers, dementia, scientists say today.
[00:38:57.593 --> 00:39:00.656]  Dementia, basically Alzheimer's.
[00:39:00.656 --> 00:39:03.478]  All of this is happening and it's a cocktail.
[00:39:03.478 --> 00:39:08.101]  And these social engineers, they don't want you outside, they don't want you exercising.
[00:39:08.101 --> 00:39:12.305]  Every study shows it is buoying, it is mind-altering.
[00:39:13.643 --> 00:39:19.869]  When I've had family in the hospital, or family that's died, and I'm depressed, I'll just go out and hike five miles.
[00:39:19.869 --> 00:39:20.730]  Boom!
[00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.952]  I'm still upset, but not depressed.
[00:39:22.952 --> 00:39:24.133]  You gotta hike.
[00:39:24.133 --> 00:39:25.714]  You gotta exercise.
[00:39:25.714 --> 00:39:26.875]  You've gotta kayak.
[00:39:26.875 --> 00:39:28.057]  You've gotta bicycle.
[00:39:28.057 --> 00:39:32.100]  Even if it's 30 minutes a day, you've got to do it.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.562]  You've got to get outside.
[00:39:33.562 --> 00:39:36.024]  You're designed to live outside.
[00:39:36.024 --> 00:39:38.567]  You're designed to love music, good music.
[00:39:39.267 --> 00:39:41.148]  It's not a drug.
[00:39:41.148 --> 00:39:54.755]  Let's finish with this creepy newscast showing teenagers clearly joking around because there are some quacky websites that go, get our music, you know, it'll increase your brain capacity.
[00:39:54.755 --> 00:40:02.439]  I've seen quacky stuff sold where you buy a flashing light on your computer that ups your frequency and can cure things.
[00:40:02.439 --> 00:40:06.681]  So yeah, the government can find quacks claiming that colored lights and music
[00:40:07.601 --> 00:40:08.601]  It sounds like this.
[00:40:29.272 --> 00:40:34.698]  and uses binaural or two-tone technology to alter your brain waves and mental state.
[00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:41.264]  Kelly Johnson is a parent and teacher and had never even heard of eye dosing or digital drugs until now.
[00:40:41.264 --> 00:40:47.791]  It's just scary, definitely scary to know that, you know, just one more thing, one more thing to look out for.
[00:40:48.291 --> 00:40:59.559]  Recently, Mustang Public School sent out a letter warning parents about the new trend after several high school students reported having physiological effects after trying one of these digital downloads.
[00:40:59.559 --> 00:41:02.061]  Students and graduates are still talking about it.
[00:41:02.061 --> 00:41:04.482]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:41:04.482 --> 00:41:15.170]  So they take some YouTube videos of people joking, they put an image of Bath-O-Mat up on the screen, and they say tones like boobs or techno music.
[00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.791]  And again, there's some truth to it.
[00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:23.437]  Music, sports, all the studies have shown mass psychology.
[00:41:23.437 --> 00:41:31.649]  When you're in a crowd of people, even intellectuals and highly intelligent people who have strong wills can get sucked in to mob psychology.
[00:41:31.649 --> 00:41:33.352]  But this is just part of being human.
[00:41:34.778 --> 00:41:39.181]  And it's the suggestibility of these youth who've been trained and brought up on television.
[00:41:39.181 --> 00:41:41.703]  Remember about a decade ago, Pokemon?
[00:41:41.703 --> 00:41:45.225]  There were massive seizures in Japan and the U.S.
[00:41:45.225 --> 00:41:49.008]  whenever they would have flashing, strobing lights with the children.
[00:41:49.008 --> 00:41:59.695]  But they found in the studies that it was only after hours of television viewing did the children get into a suggestible enough state to then have convulsions.
[00:41:59.695 --> 00:42:02.957]  And that was government-designed programming.
[00:42:02.957 --> 00:42:04.578]  So basically, the globalists
[00:42:05.539 --> 00:42:06.339]  I mean, there is some truth to it.
[00:42:18.649 --> 00:42:20.350]  But a very small colonel.
[00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:26.491]  And they're only targeting the general public that's out there enjoying music and going, wow, it can change the way I feel.
[00:42:26.491 --> 00:42:34.074]  But if you go back to World War II, they found that large percentages of the troops wouldn't kill somebody up close in trench warfare.
[00:42:34.074 --> 00:42:35.834]  They found in World War I as well.
[00:42:35.834 --> 00:42:38.475]  So they introduced pop-up targets of bad guys.
[00:42:39.312 --> 00:42:48.987]  To where people would instinctively shoot the bad guys on the firing range, and they found that it went from around half of people refusing to shoot up close, to only about 10%.
[00:42:48.987 --> 00:42:54.595]  By Vietnam, with just pop-up targets, only about 10% of troops wouldn't shoot people up close.
[00:42:55.276 --> 00:42:56.257]  Today, it's almost 100%.
[00:42:56.257 --> 00:43:06.705]  And the Pentagon developed games like Doom, where you simulate killing people, their guts, their blood splattering, and your brain sees that as real.
[00:43:06.705 --> 00:43:19.395]  Also, you see violence increasing after the 1950s, and crime increasing as the amount of television increased, the amount of viewing, and the amount of people watching more television, because anybody who's watched a lot of television or movies, you've seen
[00:43:20.433 --> 00:43:22.856]  Hundreds of thousands of simulated murders and killings.
[00:43:22.856 --> 00:43:26.480]  I mean, there's got to be a hundred zombie movies that have come out in the last decade.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.662]  I mean, there's got to be more than ten a year.
[00:43:28.662 --> 00:43:34.509]  And I remember as a youth, I'd watch mild horror movies when I was over at a friend's house and become upset and scared.
[00:43:35.564 --> 00:43:43.886]  And after I watched movies like Alien and stuff like that and got scared, now it doesn't scare me because I've become desensitized to it.
[00:43:43.886 --> 00:43:54.929]  And so what the government and the corporate media has done is mind control at so many levels with semantics, how they twist words, the flashing lights, the music, the manipulation.
[00:43:55.709 --> 00:44:01.954]  The government coming out after 9-11 and using the fear and the trauma to say we need to torture people including their children in front of them.
[00:44:01.954 --> 00:44:03.596]  The Washington Post promoted it.
[00:44:03.596 --> 00:44:06.278]  Then fiction like 24 promoted it.
[00:44:06.278 --> 00:44:08.740]  And now we've been conditioned to accept torture.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.342]  Just like we've been conditioned to accept...
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:17.345]  Implantable microchips, or face scanning, or thumb printing to buy and sell, and now it's going in everywhere.
[00:44:17.345 --> 00:44:21.548]  So, it's really just acclimation that's going on.
[00:44:21.548 --> 00:44:32.057]  But the fact that they're hyping all of this is ridiculous, and now I've spent much of the hour on this subject, but I think it's been a worthwhile area to discuss.
[00:44:32.057 --> 00:44:40.704]  Now let's get into what we should really be concerned about, the forced drugging of water, and all these other systems in the food, and in the air.
[00:44:41.957 --> 00:44:44.898]  This is out of the register.
[00:44:44.898 --> 00:44:49.119]  City received citation for not fluoridating water.
[00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:49.780]  And it goes on.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:57.682]  The city of Watsonville has been cited by the California Department of Public Health for failure to comply with an order by the state to fluoridate the water supply.
[00:44:57.682 --> 00:45:08.066]  The citation was received by the city Thursday and demands written assurance from the city by August 29th that it will comply and plan and schedule a fluoridation submitted by
[00:45:09.082 --> 00:45:14.365]  September 19th, City Council Al Smith said the citation appeared to be out of the clear blue.
[00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:16.326]  We've been in communication with the Department of Health, he said.
[00:45:16.326 --> 00:45:18.327]  I was surprised, but this is it.
[00:45:18.327 --> 00:45:23.510]  Fluoridation has been an issue since the City Council first passed a resolution accepting a grant for defluoride.
[00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:26.992]  In 2002, Fluoridation 2010 Work Group offered the city $946,000 to fluoridate, because the government cares so much about you.
[00:45:31.775 --> 00:45:42.018]  But in November of last year, Watsonville residents concerned about the safety of fluoride passed Measure S, banning all substances from the water, not specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which includes fluoride.
[00:45:42.018 --> 00:45:51.600]  And you now have the majority of FDA and EPA scientists going to Congress and saying sodium fluoride causes cancer and is deadly and reduces fertility.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:57.002]  One part per million can cause up to a 20 percent, on average it's about 15, IQ reduction.
[00:45:57.002 --> 00:46:00.863]  People aren't, the US IQ is now the lowest in the world.
[00:46:01.443 --> 00:46:05.650]  Not our test scores, not our laziness, not our decadence.
[00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.395]  We're lazy and decadent for a reason.
[00:46:08.395 --> 00:46:14.384]  For 60 years, almost every major city, over 70% of the nation now drinks fluorinated water.
[00:46:14.384 --> 00:46:15.726]  It passed that number a few years ago.
[00:46:17.031 --> 00:46:24.496]  You are lethargic and dumbed down and can't focus and have reduced fertility and cancer rates are off the charts for a lot of reasons.
[00:46:24.496 --> 00:46:28.139]  But the biggest one is fluoridation of water, fluoridation of food.
[00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:30.761]  Most processed foods have it added.
[00:46:30.761 --> 00:46:33.923]  They now for five years have been spraying it on crops as a pesticide.
[00:46:33.923 --> 00:46:37.506]  It goes through the cell walls and bioaccumulates in the crops.
[00:46:37.506 --> 00:46:38.787]  This is all admitted.
[00:46:38.787 --> 00:46:41.509]  We are being dosed with massive amounts of it.
[00:46:41.509 --> 00:46:43.751]  The toothpaste I was driving in this morning.
[00:46:44.694 --> 00:46:46.774]  My iPhone camera's fogged up and screwed up.
[00:46:46.774 --> 00:46:48.135]  I guess I gotta go take it in.
[00:46:48.135 --> 00:46:50.755]  I couldn't take a photo of a Sparklets truck.
[00:46:50.755 --> 00:46:54.856]  It had a big pink sign on the back saying, fluoride water for babies.
[00:46:54.856 --> 00:46:58.717]  It's even worse for babies statistically, the amount of brain damage it causes.
[00:46:58.717 --> 00:47:02.598]  And they're cold-bloodedly doing this right out in the open.
[00:47:02.598 --> 00:47:03.498]  Yeah, they're CDC.
[00:47:03.498 --> 00:47:07.259]  Community Water Fluoridation Stats now reaches nearly 70% of U.S.
[00:47:07.259 --> 00:47:08.839]  population.
[00:47:08.839 --> 00:47:09.759]  And when did that come out?
[00:47:09.759 --> 00:47:12.120]  Because the numbers I saw two years ago was it had already passed 70%.
[00:47:14.608 --> 00:47:15.229]  Okay, this year.
[00:47:15.229 --> 00:47:16.551]  So it's just now hitting 70.
[00:47:16.551 --> 00:47:18.934]  The report I saw was over 70.
[00:47:18.934 --> 00:47:20.836]  Thanks for pulling it up, guys.
[00:47:20.836 --> 00:47:25.482]  The issue here is they're racing to get the entire country and entire world fluoridated.
[00:47:25.482 --> 00:47:30.448]  I've seen cases where $5 million was spent in a small town
[00:47:31.169 --> 00:47:34.852]  In Kansas, if I remember correctly, just to get them to fluoridate over a decade.
[00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:38.476]  They spent millions to get San Antonio to fluoridate a few years ago.
[00:47:38.476 --> 00:47:41.639]  The citizens knew what was going on down there, okay?
[00:47:41.639 --> 00:47:49.366]  And now, California comes in and says, we're gonna criminally come after your city, we're gonna cite you if you don't do this.
[00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:51.568]  Since when do they get to forcibly medicate us?
[00:47:51.568 --> 00:47:56.833]  And now they say, hey, we wanna put statins in the water, and we wanna put lithium in the water, both toxic.
[00:47:57.927 --> 00:48:04.502]  Now they're talking about making kids in public school take statins every week to help their cholesterol.
[00:48:04.502 --> 00:48:07.950]  They are forced drugging us and they are setting
[00:48:10.066 --> 00:48:11.147]  The President
[00:48:31.297 --> 00:48:32.758]  No, no, no.
[00:48:32.758 --> 00:48:35.999]  Tens of thousands in the U.S., babies are growing breasts.
[00:48:35.999 --> 00:48:37.920]  Three-year-olds are menstruating.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.121]  Three-year-old girls.
[00:48:39.121 --> 00:48:45.964]  And then it burns them out, it accelerates their aging, and they get massive increases in breast cancer.
[00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:47.325]  That's all admitted.
[00:48:47.325 --> 00:48:51.487]  Do they take bisphenol A out of most of the plastic products and food?
[00:48:51.487 --> 00:48:52.788]  No, they don't.
[00:48:52.788 --> 00:48:57.310]  Do you know when you microwave something in a bisphenol A tray, it massively
[00:48:58.988 --> 00:49:01.269]  Off-gases it into your food?
[00:49:01.269 --> 00:49:04.150]  Years ago, I'd be eating plastic stuff that I'd microwaved.
[00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.871]  It could taste the poison.
[00:49:06.871 --> 00:49:08.331]  You wonder why you're obese?
[00:49:08.331 --> 00:49:12.453]  Americans were eating more fattening foods 30 years ago, the statistics show.
[00:49:12.453 --> 00:49:19.955]  But we're fatter and more unhealthy today because of the hormones, the bisphenol A, the sodium fluoride attacks the thyroid.
[00:49:19.955 --> 00:49:22.496]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's epidemic amongst women.
[00:49:22.496 --> 00:49:25.117]  Every time I'm sitting in a restaurant,
[00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:28.163]  Or go to church with my parents.
[00:49:28.163 --> 00:49:40.466]  Or, just constantly, all I hear women talking about is, yeah, I'm 25 years old, and the doctor says I've got an 80-year-old thyroid, but he's giving me hormones to help.
[00:49:40.466 --> 00:49:44.987]  Fluoride savages your thyroid, women.
[00:49:44.987 --> 00:49:47.408]  Bisphenol A savages your thyroid.
[00:49:48.632 --> 00:49:52.436]  Honey, you're not supposed to be fat on the small diet you're eating.
[00:49:52.436 --> 00:49:55.979]  You're not supposed to have your hair falling out at 25, honey.
[00:49:55.979 --> 00:49:59.962]  Most of the women I know above the age of 35 are having their hair start to fall out.
[00:49:59.962 --> 00:50:01.364]  It's epidemic!
[00:50:01.364 --> 00:50:02.245]  It's epidemic!
[00:50:02.245 --> 00:50:05.307]  And do the doctors say, don't eat bisphenol A?
[00:50:05.307 --> 00:50:10.932]  Don't eat stuff and drink liquids out of bisphenol A that lines all the cans, most of the bottles?
[00:50:11.991 --> 00:50:13.572]  Do they tell you when you microwave it?
[00:50:13.572 --> 00:50:17.515]  But, oh, oh, it hyper-feminizes and then accelerates the aging of women.
[00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:22.819]  Men, it makes us effeminate and it makes us passive and reduces our fertility.
[00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:25.961]  Testicular cancer, off the charts.
[00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:27.562]  Prostate cancer, off the charts.
[00:50:27.562 --> 00:50:31.825]  These are the hormonal glands that are being bombarded with this stuff.
[00:50:31.825 --> 00:50:35.888]  So, the government says they're worried about techno music and they need to ban it.
[00:50:37.622 --> 00:50:39.043]  They're not worried about fluoride.
[00:50:39.043 --> 00:50:47.566]  In fact, they want to make you drink it and other chemicals and buy phenol A. And at least in China, they get mad at one-year-olds growing breasts.
[00:50:47.566 --> 00:50:49.267]  Three-year-olds having periods.
[00:50:49.267 --> 00:50:50.268]  Not here.
[00:50:50.268 --> 00:50:50.868]  Go to the doctor.
[00:50:50.868 --> 00:50:52.248]  Hey, my three-year-old's having a period.
[00:50:52.248 --> 00:50:55.410]  We'll just, we'll give her some hormones to block that and screw her all up.
[00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:56.290]  Thanks, doc.
[00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:56.910]  Thanks a lot.
[00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:58.651]  My daughter's gonna die of cancer in a few years.
[00:50:58.651 --> 00:50:59.391]  Thank you.
[00:50:59.391 --> 00:51:00.372]  Thank you for murdering her.
[00:51:00.712 --> 00:51:01.292]  Attention!
[00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:06.293]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[00:51:06.293 --> 00:51:11.995]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[00:51:11.995 --> 00:51:19.137]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[00:51:19.137 --> 00:51:27.899]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[00:51:29.099 --> 00:51:32.240]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:39.084]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[00:51:39.084 --> 00:51:48.028]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[00:51:48.028 --> 00:51:52.650]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:53.150]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again 800-902-6969
[00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:05.798]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.798 --> 00:52:06.798]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.798 --> 00:52:09.240]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.261]  A republic.
[00:52:10.261 --> 00:52:12.903]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.903 --> 00:52:15.165]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:17.186]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.186 --> 00:52:18.887]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.887 --> 00:52:20.188]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.188 --> 00:52:20.809]  Children?
[00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:21.930]  Our education?
[00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:22.750]  Our money?
[00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:26.413]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.773 --> 00:52:30.437]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.437 --> 00:52:31.739]  You have been warned.
[00:52:31.739 --> 00:52:32.760]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.921]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:34.842]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.842 --> 00:52:35.723]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.723 --> 00:52:38.246]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.246 --> 00:52:42.010]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:47.074]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:47.074 --> 00:52:48.576]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.576 --> 00:52:49.657]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.657 --> 00:53:02.347]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:04.369]  Remain in your houses.
[00:53:04.369 --> 00:53:08.253]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:10.117 --> 00:53:11.478]  Will they do it?
[00:53:11.478 --> 00:53:14.081]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:14.081 --> 00:53:20.548]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:20.548 --> 00:53:22.750]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:24.732]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:53:27.034 --> 00:53:31.921]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:36.827]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:36.827 --> 00:53:41.634]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:53:42.555 --> 00:53:50.980]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.481]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:53:53.481 --> 00:53:56.543]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[00:53:56.543 --> 00:54:02.886]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:54:02.886 --> 00:54:09.350]  Well, you know, I've gone into a rant here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:10.776 --> 00:54:15.662]  I know we've got Mark, Issa, Scotty, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:54:15.662 --> 00:54:17.465]  We'll get to you with Catherine Austin Fish.
[00:54:17.465 --> 00:54:20.589]  You can speak about any issue.
[00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:21.911]  You know, we'll just get her on at 8 after.
[00:54:21.911 --> 00:54:25.536]  I'm going to start taking their calls for that little short segment, and then once we get her on, I'll take calls as well.
[00:54:27.341 --> 00:54:28.601]  Oh, she's at one o'clock.
[00:54:28.601 --> 00:54:31.082]  Well, good, I'll take their calls coming up next hour.
[00:54:31.082 --> 00:54:33.263]  I'm sorry, I didn't look at my list correctly.
[00:54:33.263 --> 00:54:50.609]  By the way, I went to Target this weekend with my wife to buy some pots and pans, and we noticed that almost all of the Tupperware is now glass, because people are now aware of the fact that bisphenol A is deadly.
[00:54:51.405 --> 00:54:56.188]  So your purchases are making them convert almost completely over to glass.
[00:54:56.188 --> 00:55:02.053]  If you start demanding that from other manufacturers, we can beat this together with our purchases.
[00:55:02.053 --> 00:55:03.113]  But here's an example.
[00:55:03.113 --> 00:55:06.636]  I've asked the folks here to buy paper cups for coffee.
[00:55:07.574 --> 00:55:09.075]  And I usually have it.
[00:55:09.075 --> 00:55:22.507]  But I'm so weak-minded that when they do buy Bisfenol A laced cups and I pour hot coffee into it and it leeches, I still come in and drink the poison like Romans lining their wine jugs with lead.
[00:55:25.669 --> 00:55:33.611]  I bought a vitamin water that's got bisphenol A reportedly in the plastic and drank it when I was getting gas this morning because I was thirsty.
[00:55:33.611 --> 00:55:35.211]  I'm weak-minded.
[00:55:35.211 --> 00:55:36.691]  None of us are perfect.
[00:55:36.691 --> 00:55:43.273]  This stuff is laid everywhere for us, but at least keep your children away from this stuff, okay?
[00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:44.553]  I'm not perfect.
[00:55:44.553 --> 00:55:48.134]  People say, well, why did you just admit you're drinking out of bisphenol A, you idiot?
[00:55:48.134 --> 00:55:51.775]  I'm pointing out how I can't stay conscious of this, but you know what?
[00:55:52.739 --> 00:56:04.543]  For my children, for when they go to school, they're homeschooled but they go to an academy that's two days a week for homeschoolers, we have glassware for them.
[00:56:04.543 --> 00:56:05.683]  At least I'm doing that.
[00:56:05.683 --> 00:56:08.904]  There's no plastic that my children drink out of.
[00:56:08.904 --> 00:56:12.025]  Those little paper juice boxes lined with bisphenol A.
[00:56:12.881 --> 00:56:17.587]  You've got to do it or it's going to screw up your sons and screw up your daughters.
[00:56:17.587 --> 00:56:20.551]  So at least, at least I'm doing that for my children.
[00:56:20.551 --> 00:56:29.504]  And I'm trying to train myself to not ever eat fast food, to not ever eat processed foods, to not drink out of these poisons.
[00:56:31.195 --> 00:56:36.642]  I've got a bunch of other news on this subject we're going to cover, but we're going to get to your calls first.
[00:56:36.642 --> 00:56:38.924]  Believe me, I haven't even gotten into the economic news yet.
[00:56:38.924 --> 00:56:48.455]  I haven't gotten into this incredible news where entire high schools are now enrolling everyone by law in the Junior ROTC and then threatening them to sign papers.
[00:56:49.036 --> 00:56:50.917]  And tricking them to join the military.
[00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:52.257]  It's a new form of draft.
[00:56:52.257 --> 00:56:56.338]  They're also going to mount microwave guns in prisons and jails.
[00:56:56.338 --> 00:56:59.419]  It's illegal to use these in war, but they're going to use them against citizens.
[00:56:59.419 --> 00:57:03.021]  That's coming up after we take your phone calls.
[00:57:03.021 --> 00:57:06.482]  But before I go any further, I want to tell you about Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:57:06.482 --> 00:57:07.422]  Wonderful folks.
[00:57:07.422 --> 00:57:16.685]  They've got their main product, the inner food, with 20 superfoods where you absorb it all, instead of like vitamins where you pass most of it.
[00:57:17.405 --> 00:57:19.166]  Amazing systems.
[00:57:19.166 --> 00:57:22.067]  Innerfood.com, the best green food, super food out there.
[00:57:22.067 --> 00:57:25.708]  E-N-E-R food.com or 866-762-9238.
[00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:25.888]  866-762-9238.
[00:57:25.888 --> 00:57:33.330]  They've got healthy coffees infused with rainforest polysaccharides.
[00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:38.512]  They've got a bunch of other great products and discounts when you go to their website and type in Alex Jones.
[00:57:38.512 --> 00:57:39.372]  You can also give them a call.
[00:57:39.372 --> 00:57:39.432]  866-762-9238.
[00:57:39.432 --> 00:57:39.492]  866-762-9238.
[00:57:39.492 --> 00:57:39.892]  Innerfood.com.
[00:57:46.474 --> 00:57:49.937]  That's E-N-E-R, food.com.
[00:57:49.937 --> 00:57:52.579]  And finally, made in the good old U.S.
[00:57:52.579 --> 00:58:08.951]  of A., Diamond Gusset shirts, jeans, regular jeans, motorcycle jeans, 8888 Gusset, 8888 Gusset, that's 8888 Gusset, Gusset spelled G-U-S-S-E-T, gussetclothing.com, gussetclothing.com.
[00:58:10.752 --> 00:58:17.476]  And they're all made in America, and they don't split on you, and they're triple-sewed, and they're super comfortable, and I've got pairs of my wear.
[00:58:17.476 --> 00:58:18.496]  Aaron just loves them.
[00:58:18.496 --> 00:58:22.699]  He's gotten rid of all of his crummy Levi's made in Mexico.
[00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:25.860]  They sew a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.522]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:58:28.522 --> 00:58:29.782]  Others don't.
[00:58:29.782 --> 00:58:32.704]  GussetClothing.com or 888-8GUSSET.
[00:58:32.704 --> 00:58:35.606]  And don't forget, InnerFood.com.
[00:58:35.606 --> 00:58:39.768]  We'll be right back with the second hour of your calls and a blitzkrieg of news.
[00:58:41.977 --> 00:58:45.500]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.662]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.162 --> 00:58:54.725]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.725 --> 00:58:55.626]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.626 --> 00:58:59.069]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.909]  Number 2.
[00:58:59.909 --> 00:59:04.813]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.813 --> 00:59:05.553]  It's true.
[00:59:05.553 --> 00:59:10.437]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.437 --> 00:59:11.258]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.258 --> 00:59:14.840]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.543]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.743 --> 00:59:19.544]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.544 --> 00:59:22.306]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.306 --> 00:59:25.990]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.771]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.771 --> 00:59:30.914]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.914 --> 00:59:35.679]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.959 --> 00:59:40.122]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.122 --> 00:59:41.923]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.923 --> 00:59:44.185]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.185 --> 00:59:46.787]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.787 --> 00:59:47.768]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.768 --> 00:59:48.989]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:10.115]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.115 --> 01:00:11.696]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.696 --> 01:00:13.258]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.258 --> 01:00:17.442]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.442 --> 01:00:21.506]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:32.072]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, making big progress in awakening the global population to the New World Order tyranny.
[01:00:32.072 --> 01:00:35.114]  Masses of news coming up later in the hour.
[01:00:35.114 --> 01:00:43.119]  Katherine Austin Fitz, headed up HUD, an insider exposing the banker crimes, will be joining us in the third hour today.
[01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:47.202]  We've got serious violence increasing on the Mexico-Texas border.
[01:00:47.202 --> 01:00:48.943]  Kidnappings, you name it.
[01:00:48.943 --> 01:00:52.526]  They're also trying to enroll entire high schools forcibly.
[01:00:52.526 --> 01:00:53.326]  That's the headline.
[01:00:55.688 --> 01:00:56.388]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:01:21.093 --> 01:01:25.055]  I absolutely do, but let's not brag here, shall we?
[01:01:25.055 --> 01:01:30.958]  For those that don't know, Adonis, the Greek demigod, go ahead.
[01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.819]  You can hear me right, Alex, is that correct?
[01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:36.741]  I can hear you loud and clear from the Emerald Isle.
[01:01:36.741 --> 01:01:37.862]  Fantastic.
[01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:47.747]  Alex, I've been a Prison Planet TV member for a little while now, and I've been listening to you for about five years, and I'm really, really impressed with what you're doing.
[01:01:49.239 --> 01:02:00.706]  I'd like to really thank you, first of all, for the position that you're taking on the mosque issue, because this is really an issue of property rights and free speech, essentially.
[01:02:00.706 --> 01:02:09.971]  Well, I took that from the beginning, but now we know the number two shareholder in Fox is the main funder of this imam who's building the mosque.
[01:02:09.971 --> 01:02:14.934]  The imam is hooked in with the FBI, Trilateral Commission, CFR, top globalists.
[01:02:14.934 --> 01:02:17.476]  This whole thing is staged to demonize Muslims.
[01:02:18.885 --> 01:02:22.067]  Well, that's what I was calling about, actually.
[01:02:22.067 --> 01:02:37.656]  I'm a Muslim myself, and I went to the Muslim Leaders of Tomorrow Conference in Qatar, held by the Asma Society, the American Society for Muslim Advancement, which was created by Imam Faisal.
[01:02:37.656 --> 01:02:40.778]  And I've seen a lot of the work that he's done.
[01:02:43.456 --> 01:02:44.977]  Well, he may be a good guy.
[01:02:44.977 --> 01:02:54.465]  He may have been a good guy, but I'm telling you, it was Fox News that first promoted this, and notice now they're involved at every level.
[01:02:54.465 --> 01:02:56.227]  So they may have set him up.
[01:02:56.227 --> 01:03:04.834]  It's just that, and I'm not blaming him for wanting to be part of the CFR because he thinks he's getting connections out of it, kind of like Angelina Jolie.
[01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:08.918]  So I probably shouldn't judge him, but the whole thing itself is a hoax.
[01:03:10.393 --> 01:03:14.095]  Yeah, well, what I would say is simply this.
[01:03:14.095 --> 01:03:26.043]  When it comes down to him in particular, I read the article that he was a globalist stooge from Infowars.com, and I think I emailed Steve Watson as well.
[01:03:26.043 --> 01:03:28.125]  I didn't get a response.
[01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:32.668]  And what I said is, I'll go and I'll see what I can find out and get responses for him on there.
[01:03:32.668 --> 01:03:35.510]  And I'll see if I can get him on your show as well.
[01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:36.630]  He's traveling at the moment.
[01:03:37.890 --> 01:04:00.148]  I mean, if there are questions there, and there are things that you want to tell him, then I think it's certainly a good idea to give him the opportunity to respond to that, because... I would love, listen, if you can get him on, we would do a respectful, nice interview, and if it turns out that he's not a stooge of them, and that they're just trying to hype this, then I'll apologize for the article.
[01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:03.451]  I think you might also find that he agrees with you on a lot of the things that you're
[01:04:04.233 --> 01:04:20.152]  Uh, but he may not say them publicly because the position that he's in at the moment is one where, I mean, if he would say a lot of the same things that you do say, he'd be demonized a lot more than you are, especially when trying to build this masjid.
[01:04:21.311 --> 01:04:30.094]  Well, I know it's a very, very complex issue and I just... It's a property right issue and Ron Paul's come out and said it's a property right issue and I agree with him.
[01:04:30.094 --> 01:04:36.557]  And if we don't have religious freedom and property rights in this country, we're not a free nation.
[01:04:36.557 --> 01:04:38.998]  I think another thing that we need to do as well is that
[01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:43.455]  Uh, looking at a lot of the Middle Eastern leadership and how they fit into this new world order.
[01:04:43.455 --> 01:04:43.996]  Well, stay there.
[01:04:43.996 --> 01:04:46.439]  I want to get your take, Adonis, on that, briefly.
[01:04:46.439 --> 01:04:49.622]  Then we'll go to Mark and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[01:04:49.622 --> 01:04:50.683]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:04:50.683 --> 01:04:51.985]  Website's ourprisonplanet.tv and infowarriors.com.
[01:04:51.985 --> 01:04:52.585]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.162]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.162 --> 01:05:05.525]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:05:05.525 --> 01:05:10.750]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:14.193]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[01:05:14.193 --> 01:05:16.535]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:05:17.156 --> 01:05:20.700]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:21.841]  Take my word for it.

[01:07:57.001 --> 01:07:58.722]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:08:02.116 --> 01:08:08.740]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:14.824]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:30.914]  Adonis, calling us from New Zealand, who's a Muslim, I think one big reason people are so upset about the mosque, when they're told, well, you need to be, you know, eclectic, you need to be open, land of the free, home of the brave,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.424]  inclusive is that people look at Saudi Arabia where they don't let you build Christian churches.
[01:08:36.424 --> 01:08:42.148]  Now, in Iraq and almost every other Muslim country, people live side by side peacefully.
[01:08:42.148 --> 01:08:46.832]  Of course, the foreign minister of Iraq was Tariq Aziz.
[01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:49.894]  And for a long time, Christians and Muslims have lived in peace.
[01:08:49.894 --> 01:08:54.678]  There were, of course, the wars between Muslims and Christians that went on for hundreds of years.
[01:08:54.678 --> 01:08:59.662]  And you had the Moors taking over much of Spain and all of that happening.
[01:08:59.662 --> 01:09:00.223]  So there's that
[01:09:00.723 --> 01:09:03.905]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:09:03.905 --> 01:09:09.228]  I mean, when you look at Saudi Arabia as a whole, I mean, the country is a Wahhabi country, and it's really
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:37.664]  I guess a very fanatical state when you look at its interpretation, very extreme interpretation of Islam, which is quite a minority in the world.
[01:09:37.664 --> 01:09:54.652]  But when you actually look at the Saudi royal family, they actually made a deal with the Wahhabists quite some time ago where they would put this interpretation of Islam, this very Puritan, very dangerous interpretation of Islam, as the law.
[01:09:55.143 --> 01:09:58.285]  And they would essentially be able to get and be able to do whatever they want.
[01:09:58.285 --> 01:10:05.331]  And if you take a look at what they do, they're out there in Monte Carlo, they've got prostitutes, they've got drugs, they've got alcohol.
[01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:09.954]  If you see a lot of the students who are international students, I've met several of them.
[01:10:09.954 --> 01:10:13.617]  Yeah, they're legendarily hypocritical and decadent.
[01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:16.089]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:16.089 --> 01:10:23.153]  So, I mean, I can appreciate the position that a lot of people take on Saudi Arabia, but, I mean, it's probably the worst example.
[01:10:23.153 --> 01:10:24.593]  Well, let's be fair, too.
[01:10:24.593 --> 01:10:25.614]  I mean, let's be fair.
[01:10:25.614 --> 01:10:27.495]  I'm not attacking Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:27.495 --> 01:10:29.215]  I'm not attacking Israel.
[01:10:29.215 --> 01:10:32.857]  I understand there's complex issues in all these countries, but take Israel.
[01:10:32.857 --> 01:10:37.719]  It's against the law to proselytize Christianity in Israel.
[01:10:37.719 --> 01:10:40.280]  Now, there are old churches that are kind of like licensed
[01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:47.997]  Travel agents, but you will be arrested in Israel if you proselytize.
[01:10:47.997 --> 01:10:52.123]  So all these Muslim bashers that are mad at Saudi Arabia, I can see their point.
[01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:53.324]  That's a form of tyranny.
[01:10:53.324 --> 01:10:54.987]  But why don't we talk about what Israel does?
[01:10:54.987 --> 01:10:57.150]  I mean, let's be fair about this.
[01:10:57.150 --> 01:10:59.212]  In Israel, you get arrested
[01:11:00.133 --> 01:11:03.156]  If you're non-Jewish and you marry a Jew.
[01:11:03.156 --> 01:11:04.057]  In fact, Google that.
[01:11:04.057 --> 01:11:09.002]  You know, Israel makes it illegal to marry a Jew, for non-Jews to marry Jews.
[01:11:09.002 --> 01:11:15.427]  So, Israel in many respects is almost as extreme as Saudi Arabia, but no one wants to talk about this.
[01:11:15.427 --> 01:11:17.229]  Everybody wants to keep that a secret.
[01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:19.031]  And again, I'm not here bashing Israel.
[01:11:19.491 --> 01:11:25.493]  You know, I just want to point out these hypocrisies, and then also point out that when the U.S.
[01:11:25.493 --> 01:11:41.159]  gets criticized for what I would call mild-type discrimination, that we need to measure it according to what other people are doing, and then ask, why is it that the United States is always, you know, called out for things that are much more mild than some other countries?
[01:11:41.159 --> 01:11:42.220]  And I'm not saying they're good.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:48.482]  I'm not saying that crazed crowd chasing a black man and yelling and cussing at him because he was wearing a sweat
[01:11:49.022 --> 01:11:49.882]  Yeah, I agree with you 100%.
[01:11:49.882 --> 01:11:55.684]  You know, when you take a look at the way that the rest of the world is in comparison to the US, you see that the US actually has a really good deal.
[01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:24.554]  And if you want to take an example, in Australia, there's a lot of problems between Lebanese youth and Anglo-Australian youth.
[01:12:24.554 --> 01:12:32.339]  And on one situation in 2005, some Lebanese youth beat up a lifeguard on the beach.
[01:12:32.339 --> 01:12:40.204]  And the weekend afterwards, 5,000 drunk, angry Anglo-Australians went and beat up every Arab they could find.
[01:12:40.204 --> 01:12:40.884]  They rioted.
[01:12:40.884 --> 01:12:42.645]  The US, where they had the 9-11 attacks,
[01:12:44.631 --> 01:12:50.956]  Unfortunately, a lot of people still believe it's the Muslims, etc., who did it when we know it was an inside job.
[01:12:50.956 --> 01:12:56.360]  But there was no riots like that, and this is what I continue to say to people.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.143]  If you want to call America racist, look at the example of what happened there.
[01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:04.886]  There's been unflinching tolerance and restraint after that, and a lot of understanding, too.
[01:13:07.597 --> 01:13:07.697]  Yes.
[01:13:24.488 --> 01:13:26.469]  Well, let's expand though.
[01:13:26.469 --> 01:13:33.474]  Over and over again, Al-Qaeda puts out statements saying, we want Iran to be attacked because they're Wahhabist is their real mode.
[01:13:33.474 --> 01:13:34.895]  They want to go after the Shiites.
[01:13:34.895 --> 01:13:43.061]  But also, on top of that, they want to stir Muslims up and have this clash because from their foundation, they have been funded.
[01:13:43.061 --> 01:13:44.081]  Radical Muslims.
[01:13:44.081 --> 01:13:44.882]  This is just a fact.
[01:13:45.382 --> 01:13:47.783]  have been funded by the British and others.
[01:13:47.783 --> 01:13:54.484]  It's just like Israel admits they founded Hamas in 1975 to try to create division.
[01:13:54.484 --> 01:13:55.744]  Adonis, we could talk all day.
[01:13:55.744 --> 01:14:00.945]  Interesting points, but I appreciate your perspective.
[01:14:00.945 --> 01:14:08.287]  At the end of the day, we're told we're giving up our liberties to fight the Muslim menace, as the media puts it.
[01:14:10.484 --> 01:14:18.447]  Almost all of the real architecture of this police state is pointed at libertarians, gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans.
[01:14:18.447 --> 01:14:20.348]  So, that's the main message.
[01:14:20.348 --> 01:14:25.589]  You know, you may hate Muslims and think they want to come and, you know, drink your blood or whatever and they're like vampires.
[01:14:25.589 --> 01:14:28.310]  If that's your view, that's, you know, you can have that view.
[01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:33.172]  My issue is that this whole police state isn't even being built for them.
[01:14:33.172 --> 01:14:34.753]  So you need to understand you've been conned.
[01:14:35.813 --> 01:14:38.535]  And, you know, that's what I have to say at the end of the day here.
[01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:46.060]  But I know that Muslims are an incredibly diverse group, just like Christians are, just like there are radical Hindus that go around bombing and killing people.
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.741]  That's the radicals.
[01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:53.505]  And the statement that, you know, all of Islam wants to kill everybody isn't true.
[01:14:53.505 --> 01:14:54.445]  I'm done talking about it.
[01:14:54.445 --> 01:14:56.827]  The point is, let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Idaho.
[01:14:56.827 --> 01:14:57.708]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:58.008]  Welcome.
[01:14:59.264 --> 01:15:08.872]  Hi Alex, here in Boise, Idaho, the economy is getting bad to the point the homeless shelters are turning people away, according to my sources in the homeless population.
[01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:18.719]  No, I've seen statistics on that, and in California they're now picking up the homeless at night and taking them to sports stadium centers, which is the beginning of the camps.
[01:15:18.719 --> 01:15:24.644]  I agree with that assessment, Alex, which is why I'm scared about a new piece of HUD legislation called PETRA.
[01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:37.948]  Basically what it does is that it privatizes all housing programs, and from what I've seen in Russia today, the housing advocacy people are concerned that this will displace a lot more people.
[01:15:40.951 --> 01:15:41.652]  Absolutely.
[01:15:41.652 --> 01:15:53.279]  You're having the core services cut, like streets and police and fire, and then the taxes are going up to pay interest to the private bankers that engineered the collapse.
[01:15:53.279 --> 01:15:56.361]  This is their takeover program they've done in every nation.
[01:15:56.361 --> 01:15:57.842]  And it's done by design.
[01:15:57.842 --> 01:15:59.803]  We have the IMF World Bank documents.
[01:15:59.803 --> 01:16:07.088]  We have new, it was actually in Bloomberg, new memos from Goldman Sachs about how they're engineering things.
[01:16:07.088 --> 01:16:09.950]  And anybody that says they're not engineering this is wrong.
[01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:26.556]  I've also heard from the taxi cab drivers in downtown Boise how construction sites are even being abandoned because apparently the construction companies are having their assets freezed by the banks.
[01:16:27.486 --> 01:16:29.928]  Let me raise that since you brought it up.
[01:16:29.928 --> 01:16:31.910]  Here's AP today.
[01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:36.334]  Home sales plunged 27%, the lowest in 15 years.
[01:16:36.334 --> 01:16:43.980]  Sales of previously occupied homes plunged last month, the lowest in 15 years, despite the lowest mortgage rates in decades and bargain prices in many areas.
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.202]  People can't get the loans.
[01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:47.442]  Or they're not comfortable doing it.
[01:16:47.442 --> 01:16:53.824]  July sales fell more than 27% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.83 million.
[01:16:53.824 --> 01:17:00.526]  The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday was the largest monthly drop on record, dating back to 1968.
[01:17:00.526 --> 01:17:03.867]  And sharp declines were recorded in all regions of the country.
[01:17:03.867 --> 01:17:08.368]  The plunge in home sales also magnified fears about the broader economy.
[01:17:08.368 --> 01:17:10.709]  So, yes, the economy is in freefall.
[01:17:12.299 --> 01:17:32.345]  Okay, and from what I keep hearing from people on housing, is that not only are they concerned about losing their homes, they're concerned that they can't really support any of their families at all.
[01:17:32.345 --> 01:17:36.586]  And I host my own talk show and one of my hosts is on housing,
[01:17:37.393 --> 01:17:40.334]  And he tells me that he has to go into the U.S.
[01:17:40.334 --> 01:17:50.796]  military because he can't afford to keep his kids in the vicarious situation that he's in.
[01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:54.117]  My friend, I hear you and I'm sorry to hear that that's happening.
[01:17:54.117 --> 01:17:57.758]  Let's go ahead and talk to Esa in North Carolina.
[01:17:57.758 --> 01:17:58.318]  You're on the air.
[01:17:58.318 --> 01:18:00.719]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:02.059]  Good, sir.
[01:18:02.059 --> 01:18:04.400]  Okay, I have one question, two points.
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:10.144]  Okay, have you ever heard of a lady called Maria Montessori?
[01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:14.528]  You know, the Montessori Teachers Association?
[01:18:14.528 --> 01:18:30.402]  And my two points is, you know, if men want to keep their testosterone levels up, you know, get plenty of drink, and you're right about the, you know, playing the video games, because they can really take a lot out of you.
[01:18:30.402 --> 01:18:32.324]  Oh, are you talking about Montessori?
[01:18:33.464 --> 01:18:36.186]  Yeah, Montessori, yes.
[01:18:36.186 --> 01:18:39.468]  It's a little new-agey, but it's better than public school.
[01:18:39.468 --> 01:18:40.349]  I've investigated it.
[01:18:40.349 --> 01:18:49.255]  When my children were in preschool for about a year, I put them in Montessori, and I didn't take them out because I was really unhappy with it.
[01:18:49.255 --> 01:18:52.738]  We just thought we could do a better education, more classical.
[01:18:52.738 --> 01:18:57.401]  It was actually less than a year, about a semester or a little more, and they just wanted to be with us.
[01:19:00.183 --> 01:19:03.765]  Montessori varies from school to school from what I've seen.
[01:19:03.765 --> 01:19:10.710]  My sister went to Montessori in preschool and she graduated with high marks in college.
[01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:12.391]  It worked well for her.
[01:19:19.596 --> 01:19:20.897]  Is the U.N.?
[01:19:20.897 --> 01:19:23.319]  Are they sponsoring that program?
[01:19:23.319 --> 01:19:25.560]  You know, I don't know enough about it.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:35.586]  Again, I think the straw that broke the camel's back was some of the teaching material was new-agey and kind of pro-U.N.y.
[01:19:35.586 --> 01:19:38.568]  So I said, get them out of there.
[01:19:38.568 --> 01:19:39.428]  That was years ago.
[01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:42.368]  I do.
[01:19:42.368 --> 01:19:43.609]  Didn't it start in India?
[01:19:43.609 --> 01:19:47.533]  I mean, now the data's coming up in my mind.
[01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.375]  If memory serves, it is kind of a U.N.
[01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:50.816]  operation.
[01:19:50.816 --> 01:19:52.138]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:52.138 --> 01:19:53.879]  Good points.
[01:19:53.879 --> 01:19:55.421]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:55.421 --> 01:19:56.702]  Stay with us on the other side.
[01:19:56.702 --> 01:19:58.304]  More calls and a ton of news straight ahead.
[01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:03.689]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[01:20:03.689 --> 01:20:12.516]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:22.764]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home the lifestyle you're accustomed to.
[01:20:22.944 --> 01:20:23.424]  I don't think so.
[01:20:46.121 --> 01:20:48.643]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.545]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:50.645]  800-876-2966.
[01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:50.826]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[01:21:00.643 --> 01:21:01.243]  Good day.
[01:21:01.243 --> 01:21:03.045]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[01:21:03.045 --> 01:21:03.445]  August 24th, 2010.
[01:21:03.445 --> 01:21:04.446]  Gold opened this morning at $12.1720.
[01:21:04.446 --> 01:21:07.888]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.4970, $6.2485 for a half-ounce, or $3.1243 for a quarter-ounce.
[01:21:07.888 --> 01:21:08.369]  That's $12.4970, $6.2485, or $3.1243.
[01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:24.189]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:25.350]  debt crises.
[01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:27.511]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:29.952]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:35.275]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[01:21:35.275 --> 01:21:36.296]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:36.296 --> 01:21:42.239]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:21:42.239 --> 01:21:48.082]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[01:21:48.402 --> 01:21:49.062]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.062 --> 01:21:49.843]  I'll send it free.
[01:21:49.843 --> 01:21:50.503]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.503 --> 01:21:51.564]  Ask for the CBO document.
[01:21:51.564 --> 01:21:51.784]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.922 --> 01:22:05.885]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:22:05.885 --> 01:22:06.866]  What have we got?
[01:22:06.866 --> 01:22:09.327]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:22:09.327 --> 01:22:10.328]  A republic.
[01:22:10.328 --> 01:22:12.969]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:22:12.969 --> 01:22:15.231]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.272]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:22:17.272 --> 01:22:18.953]  So they think they own our land?
[01:22:18.953 --> 01:22:20.274]  They think they own our water?
[01:22:20.274 --> 01:22:20.874]  Children?
[01:22:20.874 --> 01:22:21.995]  Our education?
[01:22:21.995 --> 01:22:22.816]  Our money?
[01:22:22.816 --> 01:22:26.498]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:22:26.838 --> 01:22:30.543]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:22:30.543 --> 01:22:31.805]  You have been warned.
[01:22:31.805 --> 01:22:32.826]  We have the facts.
[01:22:32.826 --> 01:22:34.008]  We have the Constitution.
[01:22:34.008 --> 01:22:34.909]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:22:34.909 --> 01:22:35.790]  We have common law.
[01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:38.314]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:38.314 --> 01:22:42.099]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:22:42.199 --> 01:22:47.141]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:22:47.141 --> 01:22:48.641]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:22:48.641 --> 01:22:49.742]  Don't tread on me.
[01:22:49.742 --> 01:22:56.604]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:23:01.058 --> 01:23:04.060]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.121]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:23:06.121 --> 01:23:08.883]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:11.104]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:23:11.104 --> 01:23:12.505]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:23:12.505 --> 01:23:14.406]  But first, the facts.
[01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.347]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:23:16.347 --> 01:23:18.328]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:23:18.328 --> 01:23:22.010]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:29.775]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:23:29.775 --> 01:23:30.375]  Sinofresh.
[01:23:30.635 --> 01:23:33.717]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[01:23:51.328 --> 01:23:51.609]  It works!
[01:24:04.657 --> 01:24:07.539]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:24:07.539 --> 01:24:09.220]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:12.182]  Scotty in California, you're on the air.
[01:24:12.182 --> 01:24:12.582]  Welcome.
[01:24:34.046 --> 01:24:34.886]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:24:34.886 --> 01:24:36.647]  I'm a real big fan of yours.
[01:24:36.647 --> 01:24:40.108]  I've been a Prison Planet TV member for about two years.
[01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:41.969]  You've really woken me up.
[01:24:41.969 --> 01:24:45.670]  I'm sure your ears burn a lot because I talk about you all the time.
[01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:50.631]  I wanted to agree with you about what you were talking about this morning with subliminals and the binaural beats.
[01:24:50.631 --> 01:24:53.812]  I used to play with that about 20 years ago myself.
[01:24:53.812 --> 01:24:59.034]  And then yesterday you had asked us what we thought government's biggest lie is.
[01:24:59.034 --> 01:25:01.975]  And of course, I think besides the official 9-11 story,
[01:25:03.522 --> 01:25:04.842]  Free energy.
[01:25:04.842 --> 01:25:14.946]  I'm sure Nikola Tesla had all kinds of patents back in the early 1900s that we would probably have free energy now.
[01:25:14.946 --> 01:25:20.428]  And that would probably destroy the whole money power structure if energy was free.
[01:25:21.721 --> 01:25:31.429]  Well, regardless, we need to get rid of the private Federal Reserve and have a national debate about the money system we want, and to get it back under Congress as it's meant to be under law.
[01:25:31.429 --> 01:25:41.457]  And, you know, exposing them is half the battle, and then having a national debate about what type of currency we want, gold back or fiat, that's up to we the people that control the Congress.
[01:25:43.075 --> 01:25:43.595]  Right, right.
[01:25:43.595 --> 01:25:47.176]  But what do you think about alternative energies like hydrogen production?
[01:25:47.176 --> 01:25:55.258]  I've actually put a couple of stainless steel wall plates together with a battery and some water and have actually... Well, here's the deal.
[01:25:55.258 --> 01:26:07.501]  What I've confirmed is, in the 70s, General Motors and others, the Japanese as well, had systems that would give you a car that could drive 120 miles an hour and would get over 50 miles per gallon
[01:26:08.321 --> 01:26:09.542]  Uh, fuel efficiency.
[01:26:09.542 --> 01:26:13.424]  So they've got deals with the oil companies, not, I mean, these are patented.
[01:26:13.424 --> 01:26:15.306]  These are on record by the auto companies.
[01:26:15.306 --> 01:26:16.707]  They go buy them up.
[01:26:16.707 --> 01:26:21.670]  Uh, they've got all sorts of zero point energy, all sorts of other things they've been suppressing.
[01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:27.493]  And then all the fake green energy like wind and things, uh, doesn't supply any of what you need.
[01:26:27.493 --> 01:26:32.977]  Uh, and, and, and it's cost prohibitive and actually cost two jobs for every job it makes.
[01:26:32.977 --> 01:26:34.238]  So yes, there is an attempt.
[01:26:35.134 --> 01:26:44.577]  to block out true energy independence and then create a fake clone of it of limited systems that the globalists control.
[01:26:44.577 --> 01:26:47.658]  So yes, energy obviously is key.
[01:26:47.658 --> 01:26:51.919]  The globalists are racing in to buy up water supplies and then restrict water.
[01:26:51.919 --> 01:26:55.360]  They're really hyping that, the privatization of water.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.341]  So, I mean, it's all paramount.
[01:26:57.341 --> 01:27:03.243]  I actually have Tommy Pallotta has made a new interactive film slash website slash book
[01:27:03.723 --> 01:27:12.649]  That he's going to premiere in the next two weeks here on this radio show, and it's going to be free, the premiere of it, to my listeners.
[01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:13.950]  So we're very excited about that.
[01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:25.518]  It's all about the energy conspiracy with, of course, celebrated filmmaker and researcher Tommy Pallotta, films like Scanner Darkly, Waking Life, Slacker, he's in that.
[01:27:25.518 --> 01:27:30.822]  A good friend of mine, he's over in Europe right now, but he's going to be on the show in the next two weeks.
[01:27:30.822 --> 01:27:33.164]  We are lining that up right now, so that should be very exciting.
[01:27:34.491 --> 01:27:36.512]  Well, I thank you for everything you do, Alex.
[01:27:36.512 --> 01:27:38.712]  I'm a big fan, and you're my hero.
[01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:39.513]  Keep up the good work.
[01:27:39.513 --> 01:27:40.053]  God bless.
[01:27:40.053 --> 01:27:41.513]  Brother, you're my hero.
[01:27:41.513 --> 01:27:48.796]  The willingness to resist oppression and to wake up our fellow humans, that is the heroic idea.
[01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.616]  We are all together.
[01:27:50.616 --> 01:27:52.997]  We are all brothers in arms, sisters in arms.
[01:27:52.997 --> 01:27:54.698]  Let's talk to Jim in Oregon.
[01:27:54.698 --> 01:27:57.478]  You're on the air, Jim.
[01:27:57.478 --> 01:27:58.379]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:27:59.321 --> 01:28:04.324]  You know, I think one of the soft underbellies of the globalists is the China trade.
[01:28:04.324 --> 01:28:08.806]  That is affecting our economy big time and nobody's talking about it.
[01:28:08.806 --> 01:28:12.008]  Yeah, no, that's the leg that's cut off and they want to put a tourniquet on it.
[01:28:12.008 --> 01:28:13.689]  Their answer is more globalism.
[01:28:13.689 --> 01:28:17.991]  Let's hack the other leg off and slit our throat and stab us 15 times in the heart.
[01:28:19.113 --> 01:28:20.834]  Let's be clear, it's not free or fair trade.
[01:28:20.834 --> 01:28:22.215]  They have no environmental standards.
[01:28:34.301 --> 01:28:39.586]  They keep their currency lower than ours, which is a trade imbalance, a form of tariff.
[01:28:39.586 --> 01:28:42.508]  There's tax incentives by our government to move over there.
[01:28:42.508 --> 01:28:44.430]  Their people have the slave wages.
[01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:47.593]  And so, of course, it's a giant sucking sound like Ross Perot said.
[01:28:47.593 --> 01:28:52.097]  You know, Mexico can't even compete with China and India, so it's imploding.
[01:28:52.097 --> 01:28:53.498]  Go ahead.
[01:28:53.498 --> 01:28:57.962]  Well, I think that that affects so many people in America.
[01:28:57.962 --> 01:28:59.764]  You listen to C-SPAN in the morning.
[01:28:59.764 --> 01:29:01.245]  Whenever trade comes up,
[01:29:01.838 --> 01:29:07.101]  Everybody's saying that China trade, NAFTA, this phony free trade is bad.
[01:29:07.101 --> 01:29:11.503]  And yet the elites, the globalists, they don't want to touch it.
[01:29:11.503 --> 01:29:13.644]  Because it's consolidating power for them.
[01:29:13.644 --> 01:29:15.005]  But look, we can do one thing.
[01:29:15.005 --> 01:29:17.366]  We can stop buying Chinese.
[01:29:17.366 --> 01:29:20.788]  And that doesn't mean that occasionally you don't have a choice.
[01:29:21.548 --> 01:29:43.186]  Uh, but, but when you have a chance to buy American-made light bulbs, or jeans, or water filters, sponsors we have, when you have a chance, or even things that have American-made components, just like five years ago you couldn't find glassware, Tupperware, now it's displacing, at least at Target I saw, almost all of its glass now, because people want it.
[01:29:43.186 --> 01:29:45.628]  Anything else, uh, Jim?
[01:29:45.628 --> 01:29:47.570]  Uh, just keep up the good work, Alex.
[01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:49.171]  You do too as well, my friend.
[01:29:49.171 --> 01:29:50.132]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:29:51.021 --> 01:29:54.944]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.944 --> 01:29:57.626]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.588 --> 01:30:05.849]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.849 --> 01:30:09.793]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.793 --> 01:30:12.016]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.016 --> 01:30:17.902]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.902 --> 01:30:24.109]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.549 --> 01:30:30.512]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.512 --> 01:30:34.694]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.694 --> 01:30:38.997]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:38.997 --> 01:30:44.940]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:48.502]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.502 --> 01:30:50.483]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.483 --> 01:30:50.903]  It's here.
[01:30:51.563 --> 01:30:58.388]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:00.322 --> 01:31:04.525]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:10.930]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:18.316]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:18.316 --> 01:31:23.199]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:31.851 --> 01:31:35.598]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:31:36.112 --> 01:31:42.874]  As powder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:42.874 --> 01:31:46.775]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:32:01.906 --> 01:32:05.867]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.867 --> 01:32:14.728]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.728 --> 01:32:19.349]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.349 --> 01:32:30.171]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:40.313]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.313 --> 01:32:45.755]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.755 --> 01:32:53.236]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.236 --> 01:32:55.997]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:07.947 --> 01:33:14.217]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.952 --> 01:33:41.921]  If you take our 80-plus affiliates and you count the 100,000-watt global shortwave, the satellites and everything, it's a lot more than 50,000 unstoppable watts.
[01:33:41.921 --> 01:33:47.306]  We got a couple of 50,000-watt AMs like that great one up in Arkansas that covers four states.
[01:33:47.306 --> 01:33:50.428]  It's a lot more than 50,000 unstoppable watts.
[01:33:51.704 --> 01:33:54.826]  God bless you all and thank you for joining us.
[01:33:54.826 --> 01:33:57.307]  The radio broadcast is just exploding.
[01:33:57.307 --> 01:34:00.648]  The podcast is picking up tens of thousands of new listeners every week.
[01:34:00.648 --> 01:34:03.810]  The Apple iPhone being downloaded by thousands every week.
[01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:07.032]  The YouTube videos, millions of new views a week.
[01:34:07.032 --> 01:34:11.314]  It is absolutely amazing how many people we're reaching together.
[01:34:12.214 --> 01:34:24.142]  Anyhow, I'm in dangerous waters here at the tip of the spear, but I'm loving every minute of it, and I couldn't do it without my sponsors, the Genesis Network, you the listeners that spread the word and support us, and my great crew.
[01:34:24.142 --> 01:34:26.143]  We just get better and better together.
[01:34:26.143 --> 01:34:29.885]  I mean, in seconds now, when I mention something, I say 70% of the U.S.
[01:34:29.885 --> 01:34:31.146]  is now fluoridated.
[01:34:31.146 --> 01:34:32.247]  Boom!
[01:34:32.247 --> 01:34:34.728]  30 seconds later, they got the CDC's own statistics, 70% up.
[01:34:37.413 --> 01:34:44.095]  There's nothing like fusing the radio show with the video archive where people can see what I'm seeing.
[01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:56.919]  Years ago people would say, oh Alex says there's thousands of studies by governments and universities saying that one part per million sodium fluoride doubles overall bone cancer and quadruples it in major studies in boys.
[01:34:56.919 --> 01:34:57.899]  It's even worse for boys.
[01:34:58.539 --> 01:35:08.764]  And you can just type it in and just literally thousands of studies, thousands of mainstream news articles, same thing with Vice Fianale, same thing when I talk about world government and globalist quotes.
[01:35:08.764 --> 01:35:10.465]  I can just play the video.
[01:35:10.465 --> 01:35:12.446]  I can just show you what I'm seeing.
[01:35:12.446 --> 01:35:13.987]  We can learn together.
[01:35:13.987 --> 01:35:17.929]  It's a communal experience of awakening.
[01:35:17.929 --> 01:35:18.569]  And it's exciting.
[01:35:18.569 --> 01:35:24.512]  I'm going to go back to your calls and get into a bunch of news ahead of Catherine Austen Fitz joining us, always informative and enlightening.
[01:35:25.839 --> 01:35:27.400]  I meant to take the special down yesterday.
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.040]  We didn't get around to it.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.121]  I'm going to have some new specials tomorrow.
[01:35:31.121 --> 01:35:35.942]  But this super special of our three newest and best-selling films.
[01:35:35.942 --> 01:35:37.823]  You buy one, you get three copies free.
[01:35:37.823 --> 01:35:39.863]  You buy two, you get eight copies free.
[01:35:39.863 --> 01:35:41.224]  That will be taken down tonight.
[01:35:42.199 --> 01:35:52.067]  So if you postmark it today and write to us, or if you order online, or if you call today, you can still get Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined.
[01:35:52.067 --> 01:35:54.068]  Buy one, get three free.
[01:35:54.068 --> 01:35:57.951]  Fall the Republic, breaking down the whole banking takeover, the eugenics, the New World Order.
[01:35:58.712 --> 01:36:00.474]  Obama becoming the head of the UN.
[01:36:00.474 --> 01:36:01.995]  It's all covered.
[01:36:01.995 --> 01:36:06.018]  I think this film's frankly more powerful and better produced than Obama Deception.
[01:36:06.018 --> 01:36:08.260]  I wish it's the one with 30 million views, but it's not.
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:09.341]  It's been very successful.
[01:36:09.341 --> 01:36:12.704]  I mean, I'll take 10 million free online views.
[01:36:12.704 --> 01:36:14.646]  But the point of concern, the globals don't like it.
[01:36:14.646 --> 01:36:17.728]  I mean, but they're glad it's not 30 million.
[01:36:17.728 --> 01:36:18.309]  Get it.
[01:36:18.309 --> 01:36:18.889]  Make copies.
[01:36:19.710 --> 01:36:21.672]  You're having a big effect.
[01:36:21.672 --> 01:36:24.354]  And of course, Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA.
[01:36:24.354 --> 01:36:28.096]  15 years of my research condensed into a 2-hour, 25-minute film.
[01:36:28.096 --> 01:36:33.401]  The entire FEMA camp takeover, the checkpoints, the brainwashing of police.
[01:36:33.401 --> 01:36:35.102]  All police need to see this done.
[01:36:35.102 --> 01:36:37.804]  Because they already know all this, but they're compartmentalized.
[01:36:37.804 --> 01:36:40.846]  So they see this, it wakes them up big time.
[01:36:40.846 --> 01:36:41.827]  Sheriffs need this.
[01:36:41.827 --> 01:36:42.868]  Everybody needs this.
[01:36:42.868 --> 01:36:44.049]  Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA.
[01:36:44.049 --> 01:36:45.950]  Buy one, get three free.
[01:36:47.182 --> 01:36:49.943]  Big discount on The Secret of Oz, Solutions for a Broken Economy.
[01:36:49.943 --> 01:36:53.864]  Such an important film for everybody to understand our monetary situation and the solution out of it.
[01:36:53.864 --> 01:36:57.226]  Very well produced by director Bill Still.
[01:36:57.226 --> 01:37:00.207]  Global Warming, Emerging Science, and Understanding.
[01:37:00.207 --> 01:37:01.767]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:37:01.767 --> 01:37:03.928]  These are all very important films.
[01:37:03.928 --> 01:37:07.149]  Highly discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:13.611]  And when you purchase the Patriot t-shirts, the ball caps, the InfoWars.com ballpoint pens to get people to wake them up.
[01:37:13.611 --> 01:37:14.492]  Hey, check out this website.

[01:37:18.124 --> 01:37:20.106]  I think we make like 20 cents on them or something.
[01:37:20.106 --> 01:37:24.150]  You can get them in groups of 100, groups of 10, whatever.
[01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:26.032]  The point is, it's all there.
[01:37:26.032 --> 01:37:30.296]  We've got InfoWars.com, Memory Sticks, InfoWars.com.

[01:37:49.308 --> 01:37:53.510]  And the power of the internet, the power of the broadcast radio show, the power of you.
[01:37:53.510 --> 01:38:05.093]  I mean, the majority of people got woken up from seeing the films online and having people give them DVDs, or somebody showing it, you know, professors showing it, or students having meetings showing it.
[01:38:05.093 --> 01:38:06.853]  I mean, it's unstoppable.
[01:38:06.853 --> 01:38:08.254]  You are unstoppable.
[01:38:08.254 --> 01:38:08.834]  No army.
[01:38:09.454 --> 01:38:09.914]  Good day Alex.
[01:38:09.914 --> 01:38:10.215]  Hey buddy.
[01:38:10.215 --> 01:38:14.297]  I just wanted to report to you on this Carver's Bay story and the Junior Rossi draft.
[01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:40.393]  I'm with the local tea parties and we're already on it.
[01:38:40.393 --> 01:38:43.555]  Do you want to get some information out there to the listeners on what they can do?
[01:38:43.555 --> 01:38:44.116]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:44.116 --> 01:38:45.717]  Go ahead and tell folks what's going on.
[01:38:45.717 --> 01:38:51.300]  I'll show them the mainstream news article about this and that was coming out in the news.
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.121]  We'll just kill two birds with one stone right now.
[01:38:53.121 --> 01:38:54.182]  Go ahead.
[01:38:54.182 --> 01:38:54.982]  Okay.
[01:38:54.982 --> 01:38:59.124]  The local principal may be beeping through as we speak, but I'm not going to take his call now.
[01:38:59.124 --> 01:39:04.968]  They are now sending me the voicemail because I wanted to get a direct comment from him before we began protesting.
[01:39:05.905 --> 01:39:06.506]  I don't know.
[01:39:20.516 --> 01:39:32.044]  And it's, um, I want to say that now that's one of more of our magnet schools where we've, it was a predominantly black community, adjacent to a predominantly white community.
[01:39:32.044 --> 01:39:36.868]  And they want to feed them into the meat grinder, and so they're playing on their...
[01:39:37.248 --> 01:39:37.508]  I'm
[01:39:56.050 --> 01:40:11.502]  Rangel's been proposing it, they've got the legislation introduced, we talk about it and they call it a conspiracy theory, but what they do is, this came out in Houston and in Denver, Colorado, you can pull up the newscast, where the parents would record it, and they make everybody join ROTC in the 9th grade.
[01:40:12.262 --> 01:40:14.043]  They say, you must do it.
[01:40:14.043 --> 01:40:15.324]  It's not elective.
[01:40:15.324 --> 01:40:19.687]  And then they come in and threaten them and say, just sign this commitment form at 18.
[01:40:19.687 --> 01:40:24.390]  It doesn't mean you have to join the Army or the Marine Corps at 18.
[01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:27.653]  And then they graduate and it turns out that they tricked them.
[01:40:27.653 --> 01:40:30.975]  But under law, you can't get an underage person to commit.
[01:40:30.975 --> 01:40:33.277]  So they then trick them and say, it's the law.
[01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:34.317]  You've got to do it.
[01:40:34.317 --> 01:40:35.338]  And it's the phone calls.
[01:40:35.338 --> 01:40:39.521]  We've played them here are going, listen, you little bastard, you're going to go to prison.
[01:40:39.901 --> 01:40:44.283]  If you don't show up down here right now, you're in the Corps now, boy!
[01:40:44.283 --> 01:40:49.186]  And then the Army guy in Denver, he got promoted for threatening people.
[01:40:49.186 --> 01:40:52.848]  So, if you want to join the military, that's your issue and be shot up with vaccines.
[01:40:52.848 --> 01:40:55.549]  Good folks in the military, but they're using illegal wars.
[01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:57.530]  But this is part of the mind control.
[01:40:57.530 --> 01:41:00.631]  Your phone sounds like an electric razor, but your points are good.
[01:41:01.752 --> 01:41:03.693]  But this is going on nationwide.
[01:41:03.693 --> 01:41:05.334]  But again, you've got one minute.
[01:41:05.334 --> 01:41:06.915]  Thanks for bringing it up.
[01:41:06.915 --> 01:41:10.758]  Finish up with what the community is saying, then I'll cover the story.
[01:41:10.758 --> 01:41:19.124]  Okay, well now in South Carolina, we do have compulsory service in the state militia, but this is definitely not the state militia, what they're doing with the federal military program.
[01:41:19.124 --> 01:41:29.791]  And we're pushing the local Tea Parties to join us, to go out there and protest if they will not establish a stand-alone PE class and restore the PE class that this normally would be.
[01:41:30.458 --> 01:41:35.261]  This is a co-opting of the PE class into another one, and a lot of the students don't know what's going on.
[01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:52.794]  Also, uh, the website is www4, the number 4, dot golf charlie sierra delta dot helo, the number 12, dot sc dot us.
[01:41:52.794 --> 01:41:54.455]  Yeah, is that the school website?
[01:41:55.049 --> 01:41:56.870]  That's the Georgetown County Board of Trustees.
[01:42:18.277 --> 01:42:21.562]  Carver's Bay enlists 9th grade.
[01:42:21.562 --> 01:42:22.624]  Welcome to high school.
[01:42:22.624 --> 01:42:24.527]  Now drop and give me 50.
[01:42:24.527 --> 01:42:26.209]  And they have entire public schools.
[01:42:27.355 --> 01:42:32.738]  Mainly in depressed economic areas that have been federalized, where the army runs them.
[01:42:32.738 --> 01:42:33.999]  Public military schools.
[01:42:33.999 --> 01:42:37.601]  In fact, search the term, public military schools.
[01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:42.043]  And there's Chicago, LA, the LAPD's taking over the Explorer Scouts.
[01:42:42.043 --> 01:42:44.384]  They openly train them to take on gun owners and veterans.
[01:42:44.384 --> 01:42:45.505]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[01:42:45.505 --> 01:42:50.068]  They're training 14-year-olds, they've been doing it for two years, they're now 16, to take on America.
[01:42:50.788 --> 01:42:53.692]  And it's like, oh, how sweet, they're all in the army now.
[01:42:53.692 --> 01:42:56.296]  Oh, no, the army of the New World Order.
[01:42:56.296 --> 01:42:58.239]  What, you're not patriotic?
[01:42:58.239 --> 01:43:01.083]  It's like Nazi Germany, where they went in and militarized the Hitler youth.
[01:43:02.045 --> 01:43:13.033]  The entire freshman class at Carver's Bay High School has been automatically enrolled in a Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps, a military-sponsored program that trains high school students in military discipline and concepts.
[01:43:13.033 --> 01:43:22.640]  Principal Richard Neal and Navy veterans of the school's Marine Corps Junior ROTC class, we saw this at San Antonio, at the university, they trained to quote, fight the militia at college.
[01:43:24.502 --> 01:43:27.305]  Meanwhile, folks think, yeah, we're fighting to kill the Arabs.
[01:43:27.305 --> 01:43:29.627]  No, they're fighting to murder you and your family.
[01:43:29.627 --> 01:43:36.173]  It goes on, it's fulfilling the student's physical education requirement and it's part of the school's 9th grade academy.
[01:43:36.173 --> 01:43:41.138]  But Charles Holloway, a parent and freshman student of Carver's Bay, said he did not want his son in the program.
[01:43:41.658 --> 01:43:46.859]  And it goes on, but he asked to have him out, and they said, look, this is mandatory.
[01:43:46.859 --> 01:44:01.704]  Ladies and gentlemen, under federal law now, this happened, what, five years ago, they're in all the schools, and they demand access to your children during the school, during lunch, during the playground, and they lie and prey upon them.
[01:44:01.704 --> 01:44:04.964]  And a lot of these troops are whacked out, three, four, five tours.
[01:44:04.964 --> 01:44:06.685]  I mean, you know, you don't want the, I'm sorry.
[01:44:07.854 --> 01:44:09.135]  Most of our troops are great people.
[01:44:09.135 --> 01:44:10.915]  They're big listeners and supporters.
[01:44:10.915 --> 01:44:14.817]  But they'll tell you themselves, military recruiters will lie to you.
[01:44:14.817 --> 01:44:17.838]  They'll tell you, oh, you're going to get to go where you want and be with your buddies.
[01:44:17.838 --> 01:44:19.358]  You're going to get to travel the world.
[01:44:19.358 --> 01:44:21.479]  You're going to, you know, you don't have to do this or that.
[01:44:21.479 --> 01:44:24.640]  I mean, I know I went and talked to military recruiters out of high school.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.242]  And because I wanted to serve the country and they were so slimy, I walked right out of there.
[01:44:30.279 --> 01:44:31.460]  Okay.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:32.321]  Actually did it twice.
[01:44:32.321 --> 01:44:33.722]  I did it once when I was in high school.
[01:44:33.722 --> 01:44:36.164]  They came and picked us up and took us and were lying to us.
[01:44:36.164 --> 01:44:40.528]  And look, it's totally slimy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:40.528 --> 01:44:48.655]  And, uh, you look, you don't want your kids being taught sexual education because a lot of times it's perverts running the school and it teaches them to be promiscuous.
[01:44:48.655 --> 01:44:51.697]  Just like death education has massively increased suicides.
[01:44:51.697 --> 01:44:54.900]  You start teaching 10 year old girls how to hang themselves when they never thought of it.
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:55.861]  They're gonna start hanging themselves.
[01:44:56.121 --> 01:44:57.262]  It's an option now.
[01:44:57.262 --> 01:45:00.566]  It's a way to ninny around and feel sorry for themselves when they're depressed.
[01:45:00.566 --> 01:45:07.673]  So they go hang themselves in their shoelaces in the bathroom stall so they're taking the coat racks off nationwide.
[01:45:07.673 --> 01:45:09.054]  You know, they ban dodgeball.
[01:45:09.054 --> 01:45:12.578]  They teach them to submit and be these placid people who can't even exercise.
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.142]  And it just goes on.
[01:45:17.142 --> 01:45:20.891]  They just automatically enrolled everybody into it and they just don't care.
[01:45:20.891 --> 01:45:23.216]  Here's another news article while we're at it.
[01:45:23.216 --> 01:45:23.898]  Officials!
[01:45:23.898 --> 01:45:25.120]  See, they're not government servants.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.283]  They're officials.
[01:45:27.076 --> 01:45:29.937]  There are kings, they're the new superclass.
[01:45:29.937 --> 01:45:32.998]  Government officials, well it's corporate chiefs, they're above the law.
[01:45:32.998 --> 01:45:39.640]  Government officials, illegal alien officials, and then scumbag, bloodbag, parasite feeding troughs.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.080]  That's us.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:43.361]  We're here to provide to all of those groups.
[01:45:43.361 --> 01:45:44.762]  And it continues here.
[01:45:44.762 --> 01:45:48.843]  Officials unveil high-tech ray gun to be installed in county jail.
[01:45:48.843 --> 01:45:51.484]  I want you guys to search this term.
[01:45:51.484 --> 01:45:56.406]  Civilian head of Air Force says use heat ray on citizens.
[01:45:57.904 --> 01:46:05.269]  Civilian head of Air Force, or the headline may have just been, head of Air Force says, use pain ray on citizens first.
[01:46:05.269 --> 01:46:08.131]  And he was bemoaning four years ago, or five years ago.
[01:46:08.131 --> 01:46:11.533]  He said, we're not allowed to use this under international law on enemies.
[01:46:11.533 --> 01:46:16.717]  But if we use it on our citizens first, that'll give us a market, and then we may be able to get away with it.
[01:46:18.567 --> 01:46:19.908]  So, microwave guns.
[01:46:19.908 --> 01:46:25.290]  They already got sound cannons at the tea parties, you know, zapping people, uh, for no reason.
[01:46:25.290 --> 01:46:34.194]  So, so now they're gonna be in the county jail frying everyone and we have the Sonic Nausea Machine bought by county sheriff's departments where they make people nauseous for fun.
[01:46:34.194 --> 01:46:35.475]  They just set them up and it sends out...
[01:46:36.355 --> 01:46:38.476]  Ultra low frequency to make you sick.
[01:46:38.476 --> 01:46:42.398]  It's in Shomertech's weapons non-lethal catalog.
[01:46:42.398 --> 01:46:48.021]  And it says you want to make a crowd secretly sick at a rally of people you don't like?
[01:46:48.021 --> 01:46:50.102]  You want to make people at the jail sick?
[01:46:50.102 --> 01:46:50.542]  Buy this.
[01:46:50.542 --> 01:46:51.122]  There it is.
[01:46:51.122 --> 01:46:53.724]  US to use microwave weapon on American citizens.
[01:46:53.724 --> 01:46:54.984]  Associated Press.
[01:46:54.984 --> 01:46:59.527]  Air Force official says non-lethal weapons should be used on people in crowd control situations.
[01:46:59.527 --> 01:47:03.749]  And he goes on to say the microwave gun is illegal to use overseas, but first use it here.
[01:47:04.409 --> 01:47:10.511]  If we're not willing to use it against our own citizens, then we should not be willing to use it in a wartime situation, Wayne said.
[01:47:10.511 --> 01:47:11.632]  There it is, AP.
[01:47:11.632 --> 01:47:12.412]  And let me see if I was right.
[01:47:12.412 --> 01:47:13.112]  It was four years ago.
[01:47:13.112 --> 01:47:13.472]  Yes, 2006.
[01:47:13.472 --> 01:47:15.253]  Okay, there we go.
[01:47:15.253 --> 01:47:18.374]  People can't believe I just know all these statistics and numbers over the years.
[01:47:18.374 --> 01:47:19.935]  They think I just make this up.
[01:47:19.935 --> 01:47:22.816]  So now, when I say something, we show it to you.
[01:47:22.816 --> 01:47:24.256]  And I call the year.
[01:47:24.256 --> 01:47:25.376]  I call the time.
[01:47:25.376 --> 01:47:26.637]  This is not pre-programmed.
[01:47:26.637 --> 01:47:28.057]  This is not pre-scripted.
[01:47:28.057 --> 01:47:29.498]  I'm just here firing this out.
[01:47:30.717 --> 01:47:33.058]  You know baseball scores from five years ago.
[01:47:33.058 --> 01:47:34.439]  You can learn this, too.
[01:47:34.439 --> 01:47:36.700]  I'm not special, okay?
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.662]  This is what I'm obsessed with, so I'm intelligent and informed about it.
[01:47:40.662 --> 01:47:41.922]  You can, too.
[01:47:41.922 --> 01:47:43.143]  You can break your conditioning.
[01:47:43.143 --> 01:47:44.824]  You can learn about how the world works.
[01:47:44.824 --> 01:47:50.386]  You can literally tell everything that's going on with your local police when they don't even know because they're compartmentalized.
[01:47:50.386 --> 01:47:53.628]  You can study the entire operation.
[01:47:53.628 --> 01:47:58.130]  Officials unveil high-tech ray gun to be installed in the county jail.
[01:48:00.279 --> 01:48:03.282]  And this is in... How do you pronounce this?
[01:48:03.282 --> 01:48:04.043]  Castatic?
[01:48:04.043 --> 01:48:05.444]  Is that right?
[01:48:05.444 --> 01:48:06.545]  Castatic.
[01:48:06.545 --> 01:48:07.166]  It goes on.
[01:48:07.166 --> 01:48:15.174]  A high-tech ray gun built for the military that fires an invisible heat beam capable of causing unbearable pain.
[01:48:15.174 --> 01:48:16.235]  Where's Marvin the Martian?
[01:48:16.235 --> 01:48:18.357]  Maestronium-12 Detonator.
[01:48:18.357 --> 01:48:20.419]  Disintegrate the pesky Earth creature.
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:35.958]  A high-tech ray gun built for the military that fires an invisible heat beam capable of causing unbearable pain will be tested on unruly inmates in the Sheriff's Detention Facility, officials said Friday in an unveiling event.
[01:48:36.991 --> 01:48:42.852]  And if you give me a document cam shot on this, they're really enjoying that.
[01:48:42.852 --> 01:48:44.733]  If you zoom in on that, there he is!
[01:48:44.733 --> 01:48:49.514]  Oh, we'll have this mounted in the jail and just fry everyone with pleasure!
[01:48:49.514 --> 01:48:50.114]  I mean, why not?
[01:48:50.114 --> 01:48:55.135]  We already naked body-scanned the slaves with high-powered radiation and then save all the images.
[01:48:55.135 --> 01:49:03.817]  We're already stealing all the babies' blood for 38 years globally in a huge DNA eugenics Cold Springs Harbor bio-weapon program!
[01:49:03.817 --> 01:49:05.718]  Why not start frying people?
[01:49:06.829 --> 01:49:10.714]  Of course, that's how you deal with them.
[01:49:10.714 --> 01:49:12.216]  Pesky earth creatures.
[01:49:12.216 --> 01:49:15.881]  Is that a pretty good Marvin the Martian?
[01:49:15.881 --> 01:49:16.942]  I can do others.
[01:49:16.942 --> 01:49:18.864]  I'm trying to be in a good mood.
[01:49:18.864 --> 01:49:21.548]  The guys pointed out to me yesterday that I'm really stressed.
[01:49:21.548 --> 01:49:22.969]  I'm really too serious all the time.
[01:49:24.059 --> 01:49:25.980]  I don't know, listeners, do you like me screwing around a little bit?
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:28.522]  I mean, you know, this is horrible news we're covering here.
[01:49:28.522 --> 01:49:32.864]  They're dosing all the food and water with cancer agents and everything else you can imagine.
[01:49:32.864 --> 01:49:41.569]  I mean, they're openly out there saying now they're going to inject the public with submission shots that brain damage you into total servile, thumb-sucking, you know, la-la land.
[01:49:43.666 --> 01:49:48.909]  And it goes on to say, the assault inner vision system developed by Raytheon Co.
[01:49:48.909 --> 01:49:53.651]  You know, I love how the city of Austin is buying stuff from Raytheon and other big companies.
[01:49:53.651 --> 01:49:56.312]  Hundreds of thousands, in some cases millions of dollars.
[01:49:56.312 --> 01:49:59.134]  Battle droids, that's really what they're for.
[01:49:59.134 --> 01:50:08.099]  Bomb droids, face scanning cameras, license plate scanning cameras, face scanners, microphones listening to us for 12 years.
[01:50:09.079 --> 01:50:14.913]  And now they admit, yes we're listening to you, yes we're face scanning you, yes we're listening to you, yes we've got...
[01:50:15.802 --> 01:50:17.003]  I've got a few they're testing.
[01:50:17.003 --> 01:50:19.284]  I've got this from a fusion center source.
[01:50:19.284 --> 01:50:20.245]  This is going to really upset.
[01:50:20.245 --> 01:50:21.146]  This is breaking.
[01:50:21.146 --> 01:50:28.771]  They actually have mounted on these 360 shotgun mic camera systems that scan license plates, read faces.
[01:50:28.771 --> 01:50:36.997]  They've actually got long distance lasers where they can at thousands of yards away with these low intensity lasers.
[01:50:36.997 --> 01:50:38.758]  So they're very hard to see during the day.
[01:50:38.758 --> 01:50:40.719]  If there's mist at night, you can see them.
[01:50:40.719 --> 01:50:43.762]  They shoot it at your window and listen, but they don't need that.
[01:50:44.602 --> 01:50:53.846]  High-level officers who've been brought into the CIA, part of Top Secret USA, they just have a computer code and dial right into your cell phone, right into your home computer.
[01:50:53.846 --> 01:50:56.167]  They're listening to you, watching you in live time.
[01:50:56.167 --> 01:50:56.587]  Why not?
[01:50:56.587 --> 01:50:59.589]  They're naked body scanning your wife and kids to take in the baby's blood.
[01:50:59.589 --> 01:51:00.469]  Uh-uh, yeah!
[01:51:01.016 --> 01:51:01.617]  Attention!
[01:51:01.617 --> 01:51:06.620]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:12.305]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[01:51:12.305 --> 01:51:19.450]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:25.475]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement.
[01:51:25.575 --> 01:51:29.418]  For you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.

[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:39.405]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[01:51:39.405 --> 01:51:48.351]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[01:51:48.351 --> 01:51:52.974]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[01:51:53.114 --> 01:51:55.376]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again, 800-902-6969 Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:55.376 --> 01:52:02.461]  Did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:02.461 --> 01:52:03.662]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:52:09.887 --> 01:52:13.070]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:13.551]  It's true.
[01:52:13.551 --> 01:52:18.655]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.655 --> 01:52:23.880]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:30.987]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.987 --> 01:52:31.848]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.088 --> 01:52:38.790]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:41.970]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:45.531 --> 01:52:48.772]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:48.772 --> 01:52:50.533]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.024 --> 01:53:04.386]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[01:54:05.382 --> 01:54:07.984]  ...is Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:07.984 --> 01:54:09.084]  Not that pesky Earth creature!
[01:54:09.084 --> 01:54:13.207]  Oh, my!
[01:54:13.207 --> 01:54:15.508]  Okay, that's enough of, uh, imitations here.
[01:54:17.116 --> 01:54:19.958]  I could do an NPR imitation.
[01:54:19.958 --> 01:54:32.566]  Hi, we're going to talk in loving, soothing tones about World War III and putting lithium in your water and how great carbon taxes are and how we're going to shut down your economy and how the depression is helping...
[01:54:33.527 --> 01:54:35.568]  Get rid of our carbon footprint.
[01:54:35.568 --> 01:54:40.030]  And next we'll talk about how school children are being trained to keep their parents in line.
[01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:41.230]  Isn't that nice?
[01:54:41.230 --> 01:54:43.431]  Let's go to another reporter.
[01:54:43.431 --> 01:54:46.412]  Hi, I'm a soothing little snake.
[01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:48.953]  Go to sleep, everyone.
[01:54:48.953 --> 01:54:50.034]  Okay.
[01:54:50.034 --> 01:54:51.814]  No, I'm here to tell you, wake up!
[01:54:51.814 --> 01:54:52.915]  This is your wake-up call.
[01:54:54.632 --> 01:54:57.914]  Let's go down to TJ in Minnesota.
[01:54:57.914 --> 01:54:59.856]  TJ, you're on the air.
[01:54:59.856 --> 01:55:05.941]  Alex Jones, you got me going in six different expertise areas.
[01:55:05.941 --> 01:55:10.224]  I forgot what I was calling you about, but I think it was salmonella and chickens.
[01:55:10.224 --> 01:55:15.208]  I'm a chicken expert, but I'm not a salmonella expert, and there's something stinky.
[01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:18.110]  Billions of eggs recalled from... Yeah, well, here's the deal.
[01:55:18.110 --> 01:55:20.552]  I read it in the Des Moines Register this morning.
[01:55:21.974 --> 01:55:33.205]  A politician from Connecticut called an Iowa egg farmer and asked him what he knew about salmonella and of course he didn't know spit.
[01:55:33.205 --> 01:55:43.995]  So they sent a bunch of Fed agents out and they found some salmonella like finding, you know, anthrax or poop in a toilet bowl.
[01:55:46.260 --> 01:56:02.599]  They're putting a bad name on eggs now for some unknown purpose, but you haven't hit on it much, and I want you to find a poultry, chicken-loving veterinarian to tell you the scoop about what's going on in Iowa, because it sounds
[01:56:03.177 --> 01:56:05.618]  Like it's another big Fed Corp hoax.
[01:56:18.963 --> 01:56:27.846]  They always use these things to selectively put in more regulations that are then selectively enforced against people that aren't part of the mega monopolies.
[01:56:27.846 --> 01:56:32.948]  And it is a medium-sized operator that they're saying is the main culprit in this.
[01:56:32.948 --> 01:56:37.810]  But I find it hard to understand how you could have such a huge recall.
[01:56:37.810 --> 01:56:40.771]  It's just like the spinach with all of the E. coli.
[01:56:41.791 --> 01:56:58.139]  Uh, and they could never really find out what was doing that, uh, but, uh, look, you know, the more government we pay for, the less, uh, but, but meanwhile, they've got enforcers everywhere to shut down small family farms that are selling stuff on the side of the road, uh, or small farms selling their own milk or eggs or cheese.
[01:56:58.139 --> 01:57:02.460]  They've got plenty of undercover enforcers for that, but not to go into these big factories.
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:04.121]  But I'll look into it, TJ.
[01:57:04.121 --> 01:57:05.342]  Appreciate your call.
[01:57:05.342 --> 01:57:06.963]  Let's talk to Jack in PA.
[01:57:06.963 --> 01:57:07.823]  You're on the air, Jack.
[01:57:12.608 --> 01:57:14.669]  Calling Jack from the moon.
[01:57:14.669 --> 01:57:15.069]  I'm sorry.
[01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:15.690]  Go ahead, Jack.
[01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:17.170]  You there?
[01:57:17.170 --> 01:57:18.811]  Jack's gone.
[01:57:18.811 --> 01:57:20.092]  He was disintegrated.
[01:57:20.092 --> 01:57:21.833]  Let's talk to Patrick in Oklahoma.
[01:57:21.833 --> 01:57:23.834]  Go ahead.
[01:57:23.834 --> 01:57:24.594]  Another one dropped.
[01:57:24.594 --> 01:57:25.055]  You know what?
[01:57:25.055 --> 01:57:26.055]  I'm just going to stop there.
[01:57:26.055 --> 01:57:28.376]  Oh, let's put in another one.
[01:57:28.376 --> 01:57:29.497]  Three's the charm.
[01:57:29.497 --> 01:57:31.418]  Richard in Tennessee.
[01:57:31.418 --> 01:57:32.659]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[01:57:32.659 --> 01:57:34.960]  Hey, buddy.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:37.601]  Yes, I was calling in a couple different things here.
[01:57:39.713 --> 01:57:49.720]  I talked to you the first time when I was telling you that I had an allergic reaction to electric magnetic frequencies, and you asked me why I was still using my mobile phone.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:53.822]  Well, at the time, I didn't know it, but I was defeating it, and there's a treatment out there called NATE.
[01:57:53.822 --> 01:57:59.166]  For any of your listeners that want to get a treatment, it actually has helped me out tremendously.
[01:58:00.366 --> 01:58:07.588]  Well, they admit that there's frequency pollution out there that's affecting humans and all the cancer studies, but not just the cell phone itself.
[01:58:07.588 --> 01:58:10.508]  It's a microwave relay system, the cell towers.
[01:58:10.508 --> 01:58:12.329]  That's what's really powerful.
[01:58:12.329 --> 01:58:12.569]  Right.
[01:58:12.569 --> 01:58:16.189]  Well, I could tell somebody had a mobile phone in their pocket while standing next to me.
[01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:25.191]  So, but, uh, I thought for a good search term for your listeners, um, if you hadn't done it yet, I don't think you have, but conspiracy of silence.
[01:58:25.191 --> 01:58:27.812]  I think that would be a huge wrench in the whole program.
[01:58:28.459 --> 01:58:31.180]  Isn't that the documentary about pedophiles?
[01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:31.780]  Correct.
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:32.541]  No, no, no.
[01:58:32.541 --> 01:58:37.163]  We were the first people to ever put that on the internet about 12 years ago.
[01:58:37.163 --> 01:58:37.523]  Stay there.
[01:58:37.523 --> 01:58:43.766]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:58:43.766 --> 01:58:46.727]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.727 --> 01:58:47.827]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.503 --> 01:58:55.067]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.067 --> 01:58:55.967]  Number 1.
[01:58:55.967 --> 01:58:59.410]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.410 --> 01:59:00.271]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.271 --> 01:59:05.154]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.154 --> 01:59:05.915]  It's true.
[01:59:05.915 --> 01:59:10.779]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.779 --> 01:59:11.599]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.599 --> 01:59:15.182]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.182 --> 01:59:18.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:19.885]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.885 --> 01:59:22.646]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.646 --> 01:59:26.327]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.327 --> 01:59:27.107]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.107 --> 01:59:31.248]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.248 --> 01:59:36.310]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:40.491]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.491 --> 01:59:42.272]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.272 --> 01:59:46.873]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:47.193 --> 01:59:47.273]  877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.273 --> 01:59:48.115]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.115 --> 01:59:49.337]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:10.476]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.476 --> 02:00:12.058]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.058 --> 02:00:13.621]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.621 --> 02:00:17.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.807 --> 02:00:21.873]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.192 --> 02:00:26.453]  Well, we've got some devastating news.
[02:00:26.453 --> 02:00:33.117]  Drudge linked to Infowars.net, and the website went down because of so much traffic.
[02:00:33.117 --> 02:00:41.502]  Steve Watson has written a new article about pre-crime technology to be used in Washington, and Infowars.net went down.
[02:00:41.502 --> 02:00:48.946]  Drudge, about eight years ago, tried to link to Infowars and Prison Planet a few times, but we couldn't handle his traffic.
[02:00:49.506 --> 02:01:02.529]  Infowars.net is a auxiliary backup attack frigate in the Infowar, and we hadn't put it on mega servers yet, and it was just down, it just went back up.
[02:01:02.529 --> 02:01:05.370]  We've got to get our IT guys in there.
[02:01:05.370 --> 02:01:06.430]  Red level.
[02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:10.891]  I know one of them just went to lunch, but it's listening on local radio.
[02:01:10.891 --> 02:01:11.391]  1330.
[02:01:11.391 --> 02:01:12.331]  Red level.
[02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:13.271]  Red level.
[02:01:13.271 --> 02:01:13.851]  Alert.
[02:01:13.851 --> 02:01:14.231]  Alert.
[02:01:14.231 --> 02:01:14.912]  Get it back up.
[02:01:14.912 --> 02:01:16.132]  We need millions to see this.
[02:01:16.812 --> 02:01:20.194]  Pre-crime technology to be used in Washington, D.C.
[02:01:20.194 --> 02:01:32.681]  Computers will predict crime, will be committed by who and when, and of course we'd seen these out of England, and I was going to get into this later in the show, but had no idea that Drudge had just linked to it.
[02:01:32.681 --> 02:01:36.122]  Pre-crime technology to be used in Washington, D.C.
[02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:38.204]  In fact, let's just make this the key search term today.
[02:01:38.204 --> 02:01:39.064]  How about we do that?
[02:01:39.064 --> 02:01:43.326]  Well, I said I wouldn't do it for a few weeks, but I just...
[02:01:46.308 --> 02:01:47.831]  Fix the servers first, huh?
[02:01:47.831 --> 02:01:48.793]  Yeah.
[02:01:48.793 --> 02:01:51.218]  Alright, we'll think about it.
[02:01:51.218 --> 02:01:51.939]  Think about it.
[02:01:51.939 --> 02:01:55.065]  Are both of the IT guys eating?
[02:01:55.065 --> 02:01:56.528]  Red level emergency.
[02:01:58.206 --> 02:01:59.047]  Oh my gosh.
[02:01:59.047 --> 02:02:06.273]  I wish I had the money to hire an extra person, because two guys to run all this is okay when they're not at lunch, but I also need somebody at night.
[02:02:06.273 --> 02:02:08.255]  That's when stuff happens and I don't have the money.
[02:02:08.255 --> 02:02:10.517]  That's why I need people to buy books and videos and t-shirts.
[02:02:10.517 --> 02:02:11.918]  I've built much of the studio.
[02:02:11.918 --> 02:02:15.201]  I don't have the money to fix it or build it all out.
[02:02:15.201 --> 02:02:22.327]  I need to get more funds to launch this super powerful social network that's almost done, but I'm running out of money.
[02:02:23.027 --> 02:02:25.409]  And I just need your support, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:25.409 --> 02:02:29.171]  I need to be able to beef up the Infowars.net servers.
[02:02:29.171 --> 02:02:35.835]  You know, we try to do a lot of this on the cheaps, but this is huge.
[02:02:35.835 --> 02:02:37.216]  Another top Drudge link.
[02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:38.977]  I mean, that's good for a million visitors.
[02:02:38.977 --> 02:02:45.741]  Because not only does Drudge send you hundreds of thousands of viewers, he's the biggest website out there, and we've been linked by some of the other big ones.
[02:02:45.741 --> 02:02:46.822]  Not only does it
[02:02:49.022 --> 02:02:50.383]  Do you get the traffic from Drudge?
[02:02:50.383 --> 02:02:54.287]  But then thousands of other news sites link and then report on what you're doing.
[02:02:54.287 --> 02:02:58.191]  It's just a magnifier that is so powerful.
[02:02:58.191 --> 02:02:58.291]  Ah!
[02:02:58.291 --> 02:02:59.472]  It just went down!
[02:02:59.472 --> 02:03:00.213]  Drat!
[02:03:00.213 --> 02:03:00.954]  Drat!
[02:03:00.954 --> 02:03:03.276]  Double drat!
[02:03:03.276 --> 02:03:03.877]  Okay, good.
[02:03:03.877 --> 02:03:05.058]  Emergency!
[02:03:05.058 --> 02:03:05.999]  Emergency!
[02:03:05.999 --> 02:03:08.201]  We got Katherine Austin Fitz coming up.
[02:03:08.201 --> 02:03:08.742]  I hate it.
[02:03:08.742 --> 02:03:11.725]  You know, he will de-link it if it doesn't go back up.
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:20.082]  We need to have everybody take the PrisonPlanet.com version of Steve's article that's on big servers and get it to Drudge.
[02:03:20.082 --> 02:03:21.662]  I don't know if he'll change the link to it, though.
[02:03:21.662 --> 02:03:23.383]  I don't even know if they have Steve's article up.
[02:03:23.383 --> 02:03:24.643]  Yep, they've got it up.
[02:03:24.643 --> 02:03:27.824]  It just went up, too.
[02:03:27.824 --> 02:03:29.725]  Man, it's up on Prison Planet.
[02:03:29.725 --> 02:03:32.665]  Pre-crime technology to be used in Washington, D.C.
[02:03:32.665 --> 02:03:38.187]  Kathryn Austin Fitch is coming up in the next segment, and I said I was going to finish up with this caller, so let's just go ahead and go to him.
[02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:44.020]  Ah, another oversight by me.
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:46.821]  I should have had that moved to bigger servers.
[02:03:46.821 --> 02:03:48.181]  It's on some pinnacle server.
[02:03:48.181 --> 02:03:52.122]  It's actually on a big box, but that's not enough to take drudge power.
[02:03:52.122 --> 02:03:53.062]  Richard in Tennessee.
[02:03:53.062 --> 02:03:57.663]  Yeah, about 13 years ago, I was sent by the makers of it.
[02:03:57.663 --> 02:03:59.224]  It never aired on BBC.
[02:03:59.224 --> 02:04:02.084]  All the clear evidence of government pedophile rings.
[02:04:02.084 --> 02:04:03.725]  And then we did air it in parts on Access.
[02:04:03.725 --> 02:04:05.265]  Then it got picked up and put on the web.
[02:04:05.265 --> 02:04:07.585]  So yes, I am aware of conspiracy of silence.
[02:04:07.585 --> 02:04:08.386]  Powerful stuff.
[02:04:08.386 --> 02:04:09.626]  And it's all over the web today.
[02:04:09.626 --> 02:04:10.386]  People can go watch it.
[02:04:11.671 --> 02:04:15.933]  I've actually heard about it through you or through your website at some point in time.
[02:04:15.933 --> 02:04:19.855]  Seems to be a pretty fair quality version up there right now.
[02:04:19.855 --> 02:04:29.879]  But I was also going to mention, you've mentioned that you've got Tennessee and what's called Operation Stop in your newest film.
[02:04:29.879 --> 02:04:34.521]  Yeah, the Army and Homeland Security searching cars, shutting down roads even when the governor says no.
[02:04:35.433 --> 02:04:36.834]  Right, and that's the name of the program though.
[02:04:36.834 --> 02:04:38.315]  It's called Operation Stop.
[02:04:38.315 --> 02:04:48.402]  I've actually asked the Lieutenant Governor about it and several legislatures, legislature members, and no one even knew it was going on.
[02:04:48.402 --> 02:04:49.723]  Incredible!
[02:04:49.723 --> 02:04:50.543]  I will check into it.
[02:04:50.543 --> 02:04:52.024]  We've had state reps on about it.
[02:04:52.024 --> 02:04:55.167]  Right now I'm in complete battle mode with the Infowars.net story.
[02:04:55.167 --> 02:04:56.568]  Lake Dundrudge, it's down.
[02:04:56.568 --> 02:04:58.129]  We'll see what happens when we come back.
[02:04:58.129 --> 02:04:58.429]  Oh dear.
[02:05:00.615 --> 02:05:03.737]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:05:03.737 --> 02:05:07.538]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:05:07.538 --> 02:05:10.420]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:15.802]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:15.802 --> 02:05:17.283]  They're the best company out there.
[02:05:17.563 --> 02:05:21.724]  The longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[02:05:21.724 --> 02:05:24.065]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[02:05:24.065 --> 02:05:27.406]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.

[02:06:00.615 --> 02:06:05.598]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:06:05.598 --> 02:06:06.579]  What have we got?
[02:06:06.579 --> 02:06:09.040]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:10.041]  A republic.
[02:06:10.041 --> 02:06:12.683]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:06:12.683 --> 02:06:14.944]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:06:14.944 --> 02:06:16.965]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:06:16.965 --> 02:06:18.646]  So they think they own our land?
[02:06:18.646 --> 02:06:19.967]  They think they own our water?
[02:06:19.967 --> 02:06:20.587]  Children?
[02:06:20.587 --> 02:06:21.708]  Our education?
[02:06:21.708 --> 02:06:22.529]  Our money?
[02:06:22.529 --> 02:06:26.191]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:06:26.551 --> 02:06:31.518]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:06:31.518 --> 02:06:32.539]  We have the facts.
[02:06:32.539 --> 02:06:33.701]  We have the Constitution.
[02:06:33.701 --> 02:06:34.622]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:06:34.622 --> 02:06:35.503]  We have common law.
[02:06:35.503 --> 02:06:38.027]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:38.027 --> 02:06:41.812]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:06:41.892 --> 02:06:46.856]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[02:06:48.357 --> 02:06:49.438]  Don't tread on me.

[02:08:01.291 --> 02:08:04.033]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.033 --> 02:08:06.835]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.022 --> 02:08:19.564]  You know what, I'm going to do it again today.
[02:08:19.564 --> 02:08:23.146]  I want to make the top Google search pre-crime.
[02:08:23.146 --> 02:08:25.068]  Pre-crime.
[02:08:25.068 --> 02:08:27.770]  P-R-E dash crime.
[02:08:27.770 --> 02:08:35.956]  Drudge linked to one of our backup auxiliary sites, Infowars.net, instead of linking to the prison planet.
[02:08:35.956 --> 02:08:36.836]  It's not his fault.
[02:08:36.836 --> 02:08:38.958]  He can't know.
[02:08:38.958 --> 02:08:41.740]  Probably a million people will read this if we can keep it up.
[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:44.242]  Drudge will pull the link if it stays down.
[02:08:44.242 --> 02:08:45.622]  So we need everybody to
[02:08:47.216 --> 02:08:50.220]  Get the pre-crime technology to be used in Washington, D.C.
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:52.924]  It's so important for this to get out to everyone.
[02:08:52.924 --> 02:08:55.628]  So let's search the term pre-crime.
[02:08:55.628 --> 02:08:59.293]  That way, regardless, people will be able to get the story if they wondered what it was.
[02:08:59.293 --> 02:09:00.274]  Pre-crime.
[02:09:02.637 --> 02:09:03.498]  That's right.
[02:09:20.896 --> 02:09:25.301]  We're going to now, for the rest of the hour, have Katherine Austen-Fitz, who's on her vacation.
[02:09:25.301 --> 02:09:28.344]  She says she's in the beautiful mountains of the West.
[02:09:28.344 --> 02:09:37.234]  And of course, we had media, the USA Today earlier, saying that the government may need to ban music that's uplifting.
[02:09:37.234 --> 02:09:38.375]  It's a form of drugs.
[02:09:38.976 --> 02:09:41.537]  Folks, if you just tuned in, I'm not joking.
[02:09:41.537 --> 02:09:43.477]  Web delivers new worry for parents.
[02:09:43.477 --> 02:09:44.977]  Digital drugs.
[02:09:44.977 --> 02:09:47.378]  Music that's uplifting is a drug.
[02:09:47.378 --> 02:09:52.939]  I bet, well, she sounded on the phone earlier, the guy said, uplifted by being in a cabin in the mountains.
[02:09:52.939 --> 02:09:54.240]  That's evil!
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:57.781]  And the government has a vaccine that will cure her of emotion.
[02:09:57.781 --> 02:09:58.801]  Katherine Austin Fitts.
[02:10:00.444 --> 02:10:17.771]  Is an investment advisor, founder and managing director of Solari Investment Advisor Services, entrepreneur, president of the Hamilton Securities Group, investment bank and financial software developer, government official, assistant secretary of housing, federal housing commissioner, Bush the first, investment banker, managing director and member of the
[02:10:18.431 --> 02:10:19.612]  Alex, it's always uplifting to hear you.
[02:10:47.168 --> 02:10:54.093]  You know, if somebody has had enormous verbal problems, I can't tell you how much I empathize with your situation.
[02:10:54.093 --> 02:11:05.661]  I remember, I don't know if you remember this, there was one 24-hour period when every time we tried to go to your site, we'd get sent to a mirror site that looked like yours, but that would give us the virus.
[02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:06.942]  Do you remember when that happened?
[02:11:07.503 --> 02:11:08.924]  We've had all sorts of tricks.
[02:11:08.924 --> 02:11:12.027]  What that must have been was a virus on your computer.
[02:11:12.027 --> 02:11:20.894]  It's called scumware, basically, that takes over your computer when you put something in and then shows you tailored ads that look like the website.
[02:11:20.894 --> 02:11:23.076]  So that wasn't actually my site.
[02:11:23.076 --> 02:11:24.617]  We've had that happen a few times.
[02:11:24.617 --> 02:11:25.398]  It was our virus.
[02:11:25.398 --> 02:11:26.059]  Well, who knows?
[02:11:26.059 --> 02:11:30.022]  But all I can tell you is somebody really had it in for InfoWars that day.
[02:11:31.089 --> 02:11:37.953]  Well, you know, this is just the drudge link to one of our backup auxiliaries that we're going to move to a beefier server.
[02:11:37.953 --> 02:11:40.435]  It's actually on the PrisonPlanet.tv server.
[02:11:40.435 --> 02:11:41.916]  That's a bunch of servers together.
[02:11:41.916 --> 02:11:44.838]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv is having problems.
[02:11:44.838 --> 02:11:46.839]  So is InfoWars.net.
[02:11:46.839 --> 02:11:47.600]  We just purchased...
[02:11:48.396 --> 02:11:52.819]  A bunch of other big servers in our own server farm here in Austin.
[02:11:52.819 --> 02:11:54.420]  We're building that right now.
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:58.984]  That was a capital improvement of $55,000, a lot of money for us, thanks to listener support.
[02:11:58.984 --> 02:12:02.026]  So we're not just spread out all over the world, but also have this as backups.
[02:12:02.026 --> 02:12:06.309]  But for now, this Key Drudge Report link is deader than a doornail, but we'll survive it.
[02:12:06.309 --> 02:12:09.051]  We're gonna make pre-dash crime the number one search today.
[02:12:09.051 --> 02:12:10.772]  Our wonderful listeners have never failed.
[02:12:10.772 --> 02:12:13.074]  But Catherine, great to have you here with us.
[02:12:13.074 --> 02:12:15.636]  Breakdown, you've got the floor for the rest of the segment.
[02:12:15.976 --> 02:12:25.182]  I mean, I'm not going to interrupt you, break down what's happening in the economy, everything you predicted, where this is going, housing starts, and existing home sales the lowest.
[02:12:25.182 --> 02:12:38.490]  The headline says in 15 years, but the article actually says since the 1960s, 1968 show, and now the media is saying, yeah, it's not really a double-dip recession, it could be a depression.
[02:12:38.490 --> 02:12:43.353]  Well, we're not going through a depression or recession, we're going through re-engineering.
[02:12:45.054 --> 02:12:49.758]  Governance of resources on planet Earth is in the process of being re-engineered.
[02:12:49.758 --> 02:12:53.141]  I call it a financial coup d'etat.
[02:12:53.141 --> 02:12:56.123]  And what we're watching is an economy that's very managed.
[02:12:56.123 --> 02:12:57.404]  It's a political economy.
[02:12:57.404 --> 02:13:06.131]  And so the different market frameworks you hear people talk about, the financial area, in some respects aren't appropriate.
[02:13:06.131 --> 02:13:09.154]  And one of the things I want to make very clear about the current economy
[02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:30.647]  If you said to me, you know something, Catherine, you're a portfolio strategist, just re-optimize the economy to create as much wealth as possible, what I would tell you is the wealth that we could create, whether it's human capital or environmental capital or financial capital, is hundreds of multiples greater than what we have now.
[02:13:30.647 --> 02:13:31.148]  In other words,
[02:13:32.009 --> 02:13:39.671]  Our economy is totally constrained by the desire of the people at the top to want to have total control.
[02:13:39.671 --> 02:13:45.712]  And the more you institute total control, the less healthy the economy is.
[02:13:45.712 --> 02:13:53.394]  And so we don't have an economic problem at all, because the potential for wealth and abundance is unbelievable.
[02:13:53.394 --> 02:13:57.875]  What we have is a political problem, and that translates into culture
[02:13:58.896 --> 02:14:02.020]  They want to control it and hog it and be able to dominate it.
[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:03.301]  I said I wouldn't interrupt, but I can't help it.
[02:14:03.301 --> 02:14:03.942]  You're so smart.
[02:14:03.942 --> 02:14:04.863]  You're absolutely right.
[02:14:04.863 --> 02:14:05.824]  And they know that.
[02:14:05.824 --> 02:14:08.467]  They know when they raise taxes, it drives down the economy.
[02:14:08.467 --> 02:14:09.127]  They admit it.
[02:14:09.127 --> 02:14:10.048]  They want control.
[02:14:10.048 --> 02:14:12.671]  They want to destroy it to consolidate it, as you've said.
[02:14:19.238 --> 02:14:25.401]  The Western world has functioned on what I call the central banking warfare model.
[02:14:25.401 --> 02:14:26.641]  That's our paradigm.
[02:14:26.641 --> 02:14:34.545]  The central banks print money, and then the military makes sure they take it, and we get cheap access to natural resources.
[02:14:34.545 --> 02:14:37.947]  And the reality is, Alex, that you and I have been the beneficiary of that.
[02:14:39.119 --> 02:14:42.581]  People in America have been the beneficiary of this model.
[02:14:42.581 --> 02:14:47.904]  You know, how did we get the land we're standing on right now when we killed all the people who were here?
[02:14:47.904 --> 02:14:51.567]  Let's not be naive about how we got what we got.
[02:14:51.567 --> 02:14:59.291]  So, the central banking warfare model has continued, and the reality is it's not going to work anymore.
[02:14:59.291 --> 02:15:00.212]  It has to change.
[02:15:01.025 --> 02:15:10.674]  And you have a group of the leadership who are saying, OK, well, we have a plan to change it because it's no longer going to work.
[02:15:10.674 --> 02:15:15.658]  And our plan, you know, you and I refer to it as the New World Order, but it centralizes things.
[02:15:15.658 --> 02:15:20.042]  It gives much more totalitarian control and it depopulates.
[02:15:20.555 --> 02:15:31.882]  Because let's face it, if we're going to live this way, you know, with 6 billion people going to 9 billion, there's going to be real environmental issues unless you unsuppress technology, which threatens control.
[02:15:31.882 --> 02:15:33.864]  And so they've got a plan.
[02:15:33.864 --> 02:15:37.066]  And the reality, Alex, is we need a different plan.
[02:15:37.834 --> 02:15:46.778]  And what needs to happen is people globally need to come together and start talking about, okay, let's come up with an alternative plan that addresses all the issues.
[02:15:46.778 --> 02:15:53.001]  Because one thing I will say, in defense of the New World Orders plan, they're addressing all the issues.
[02:15:53.001 --> 02:15:55.922]  Now, I don't like the way they're doing it, and I don't think it's going to work.
[02:15:55.922 --> 02:15:57.283]  I mean, the reason I ended up
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:04.602]  You know, on a radio show with you and having that opportunity as opposed to sitting on Wall Street.
[02:16:04.602 --> 02:16:05.802]  I don't think their plan is going to work.
[02:16:05.802 --> 02:16:06.882]  I don't want to be part of it.
[02:16:06.882 --> 02:16:09.443]  It's disgusting to me.
[02:16:09.443 --> 02:16:11.044]  I don't want total control.
[02:16:11.044 --> 02:16:14.885]  Well, that's a moral position, too, and money isn't everything.
[02:16:14.885 --> 02:16:22.106]  Doing the right thing is so fulfilling and being part of the human community and standing up against tyranny.
[02:16:22.106 --> 02:16:25.187]  As soon as you do that, you have a lot more energy.
[02:16:25.187 --> 02:16:26.428]  You feel good about yourself.
[02:16:28.008 --> 02:16:31.492]  So many people I talk to who are depressed or unhappy.
[02:16:31.492 --> 02:16:33.975]  The media makes them feel inadequate.
[02:16:33.975 --> 02:16:37.799]  All of this Madison Avenue culture is to make you think you're ugly and stupid.
[02:16:37.799 --> 02:16:41.763]  We are beautiful, wonderful creatures who can appreciate beauty.
[02:16:41.763 --> 02:16:42.804]  You know, for me, Catherine,
[02:16:43.385 --> 02:16:54.670]  Just the fact that our eyes and our mind can appreciate a beautiful mountain vista, or a sunrise, or a bouquet of flowers, or a beautiful woman, or if you're a woman, a handsome man.
[02:16:54.670 --> 02:17:02.834]  The fact that I can appreciate the innocence and enlightenment of my innocent children and literally see God through them.
[02:17:02.834 --> 02:17:06.416]  It's like that line in the road when he's talking to Robert to
[02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:14.097]  To Robert Duvall and the guy saying, my son is like a god.
[02:17:14.097 --> 02:17:18.202]  And he says to him, yes, but in this dangerous world, that's a dangerous thing.
[02:17:18.202 --> 02:17:19.103]  I mean, I'm paraphrasing.
[02:17:19.103 --> 02:17:20.865]  I'm not saying my children are gods.
[02:17:20.865 --> 02:17:23.708]  I'm saying through that, I can see what really matters.
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:27.561]  Well, let's go back to the Scripture.
[02:17:27.561 --> 02:17:30.582]  You know, Jesus said, what I can do, you can do.
[02:17:30.582 --> 02:17:31.403]  And that's true.
[02:17:31.403 --> 02:17:36.445]  In that sense, we all have that capacity to be of God.
[02:17:36.445 --> 02:17:37.445]  Why shouldn't we?
[02:17:37.445 --> 02:17:41.947]  I mean, why shouldn't we go to the very highest, the next one that we can be?
[02:17:41.947 --> 02:17:43.608]  And the challenge is that
[02:17:46.025 --> 02:17:52.948]  You know, there are a group of people who feel that that would be, you know, that would make it very difficult to control.
[02:17:52.948 --> 02:17:59.671]  Now, in their defense, let me just go back, because I think it's important to look at this from what I call Mr. Global's point of view.
[02:17:59.671 --> 02:18:03.553]  Mr. Global is sort of my cartoon character for the people running things.
[02:18:03.553 --> 02:18:12.758]  And that is, you know, in their experience, Alex, the central banking warfare model and top-down control and force has always worked.
[02:18:14.255 --> 02:18:18.437]  Let me go back to the scripture just because there are stories people understand.
[02:18:18.437 --> 02:18:24.519]  If you look at the story of the crucifixion, remember the Romans knew it was very bad karma to kill Jesus.
[02:18:24.519 --> 02:18:25.580]  They didn't want to do it.
[02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:36.164]  Pontius Pilate was trying to figure out how to get out of it, and so he invited the crowd to choose who they wanted crucified, Jesus or the criminal, and the crowd chose Jesus.
[02:18:36.164 --> 02:18:38.124]  So the crowd got manipulated into
[02:18:39.705 --> 02:18:43.911]  You know, basically supporting the criminal and killing the good guy.
[02:18:43.911 --> 02:18:52.963]  And that's been the leadership's experience, that being honest and hardworking and doing the right thing and financial responsibility doesn't pay.
[02:18:54.199 --> 02:18:57.181]  And I'll tell you a very funny story.
[02:18:57.181 --> 02:19:04.086]  I was in London in 2001 giving a paper, and I described this in my article, Financial coup d'etat.
[02:19:04.086 --> 02:19:08.029]  If you just do a search under my name for financial coup d'etat, you'll pick it up.
[02:19:08.029 --> 02:19:15.334]  And I was asked to give a paper, which was called The Myth of the Rule of Law, about the corruption in America, but from an investor's point of view.
[02:19:16.074 --> 02:19:22.658]  And explaining sort of the economics of the government budget and how the government money was really being used to sort of corrupt the whole place.
[02:19:22.658 --> 02:19:27.740]  And this was a huge sort of transfer to the insiders that was not economic.
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:32.463]  And anyway, so there was a guy in the audience who was clearly sent over.
[02:19:32.463 --> 02:19:38.386]  You know, the boys in America had sent him over to like, you know, watch me and destroy my credibility.
[02:19:38.386 --> 02:19:39.507]  Is that the music?
[02:19:40.202 --> 02:19:41.483]  Yeah, when we come back, finish the story.
[02:19:41.483 --> 02:19:42.424]  I didn't want to interrupt you.
[02:19:42.424 --> 02:19:42.824]  Stay there.
[02:19:42.824 --> 02:19:45.747]  Katherine Austin Fitts will give you her website as well, straight ahead.
[02:19:45.747 --> 02:19:51.052]  And by the way, Drudge must be listening, because about 10 minutes ago, he switched over to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:19:51.052 --> 02:19:52.633]  I want to say hi to Matt Drudge.
[02:19:52.633 --> 02:19:53.394]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:53.394 --> 02:19:53.855]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.274 --> 02:20:02.575]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.575 --> 02:20:08.178]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.178 --> 02:20:13.200]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:13.660]  It's true.
[02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:18.223]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:18.763 --> 02:20:23.987]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:23.987 --> 02:20:31.111]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.111 --> 02:20:32.232]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.232 --> 02:20:38.917]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:38.917 --> 02:20:42.099]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:20:42.099 --> 02:20:45.241]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:48.883 --> 02:20:53.127]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:53.127 --> 02:20:57.950]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:57.950 --> 02:21:01.293]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:21:01.293 --> 02:21:05.477]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:21:05.477 --> 02:21:06.738]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:06.738 --> 02:21:10.501]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:10.501 --> 02:21:12.902]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:12.902 --> 02:21:18.307]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:18.747 --> 02:21:25.412]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:25.412 --> 02:21:31.396]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:31.396 --> 02:21:35.079]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:21:35.579 --> 02:21:39.860]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:45.822]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:45.822 --> 02:21:49.362]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:49.362 --> 02:21:51.343]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:51.343 --> 02:21:52.463]  It's here.

[02:22:00.427 --> 02:22:02.949]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:22:02.949 --> 02:22:06.512]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:22:06.512 --> 02:22:15.020]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:20.484]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[02:22:20.484 --> 02:22:25.589]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:22:26.109 --> 02:22:34.156]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[02:22:34.156 --> 02:22:39.601]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:40.823]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:22:41.423 --> 02:22:47.268]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:22:47.268 --> 02:22:50.250]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[02:22:50.250 --> 02:22:53.753]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:22:53.753 --> 02:22:55.755]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[02:23:00.524 --> 02:23:03.126]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[02:23:03.126 --> 02:23:11.953]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[02:23:11.953 --> 02:23:22.181]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to.
[02:23:22.461 --> 02:23:23.102]  I don't think so.
[02:23:45.558 --> 02:23:48.081]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[02:23:48.081 --> 02:23:49.984]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[02:23:49.984 --> 02:23:50.084]  800-876-2966.
[02:23:50.084 --> 02:23:50.264]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[02:24:07.113 --> 02:24:14.498]  Catherine Austin Fitz is our guest, and we've got her website linked up on Infowars.com.
[02:24:14.498 --> 02:24:17.520]  Give us your website address, Catherine, if folks want to learn more.
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:24.825]  S-O-L-A-R-I.com, and just click on blog and it'll take you right to the blog, too.
[02:24:24.825 --> 02:24:26.226]  So, Solari.com.
[02:24:26.226 --> 02:24:27.627]  Very simple.
[02:24:27.627 --> 02:24:28.968]  Very simple.
[02:24:28.968 --> 02:24:31.290]  Okay, you got cut off during your story.
[02:24:31.290 --> 02:24:32.331]  Recap it and continue.
[02:24:33.268 --> 02:24:42.570]  Well, I'm in London giving this presentation of a paper called The Myth of the Rule of Law, and the boys have clearly sent over this guy, you know, who somehow is going to question my credibility.
[02:24:42.570 --> 02:24:50.972]  I finished my presentation, and it was very, you know, it was very well documented, very calm, very professional, very much from the investment point of view.
[02:24:50.972 --> 02:24:59.454]  And this guy, you can see as I'm giving the paper, he's getting more and more frustrated, more and more frustrated, more and more frustrated, because he can't, you know, it's very impeccable.
[02:24:59.454 --> 02:25:00.954]  And so we finished, and he just,
[02:25:01.674 --> 02:25:04.077]  He bursts out, he doesn't even raise his hand to ask a question.
[02:25:04.077 --> 02:25:05.319]  He said, you don't understand.
[02:25:05.319 --> 02:25:10.164]  You can't trust the people to behave in a responsible way.
[02:25:10.164 --> 02:25:15.951]  And then I looked at him and I said, so you mean you kill all the people who will take responsibility?
[02:25:15.951 --> 02:25:18.534]  And he just, he was like a man looking in the mirror.
[02:25:18.534 --> 02:25:20.857]  He froze, freaked, and stood up and just left.
[02:25:21.477 --> 02:25:24.298]  I guess you just flew back to the United States.
[02:25:24.298 --> 02:25:32.479]  But there, you know, the challenge you have is that the people at the top, the leadership, assume that the people will not do the responsible thing.
[02:25:32.479 --> 02:25:34.960]  And you've got a negative cycle.
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:41.021]  And the question for us is, you know, one, we need to get as far away from these people as possible.
[02:25:41.021 --> 02:25:42.661]  We need to withdraw our support.
[02:25:42.661 --> 02:25:45.602]  Because if you look at households in this country, Alex,
[02:25:46.218 --> 02:25:46.878]  And our money.
[02:25:46.878 --> 02:25:48.640]  We're the ones who are financing them.
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:50.921]  We're turning on their TV.
[02:25:50.921 --> 02:25:52.582]  We're watching their media.
[02:25:52.582 --> 02:25:54.363]  We're buying their newspapers.
[02:25:54.363 --> 02:25:56.424]  We're putting our money into Wall Street.
[02:25:56.424 --> 02:25:57.985]  We're putting our money in the big banks.
[02:25:57.985 --> 02:25:59.586]  We're financing this.
[02:25:59.586 --> 02:26:01.787]  And we have the power to simply withdraw.
[02:26:01.787 --> 02:26:03.328]  Very passive-aggressive.
[02:26:03.328 --> 02:26:04.529]  You don't have to go confront them.
[02:26:04.529 --> 02:26:07.391]  You don't have to get hit with tear gas at a march.
[02:26:07.391 --> 02:26:08.912]  All you have to do is say, you know something,
[02:26:09.672 --> 02:26:12.835]  I'm taking my mind and my money and I'm leaving.
[02:26:12.835 --> 02:26:14.256]  Well here's a microcosm.
[02:26:14.256 --> 02:26:15.818]  Here's a microcosm briefly.
[02:26:15.818 --> 02:26:25.987]  I don't go shopping a lot but this Saturday with my wife and children I went to Target to buy cooking ware because our pots and pans were getting kind of worn out and
[02:26:27.898 --> 02:26:28.598]  We're good.
[02:26:44.545 --> 02:27:03.102]  has almost completely displaced and I was watching all my wife was shopping in that area I was watching women who do 80 plus percent of the purchases study show going up and buying the glass and I asked the lady I said why are you doing that she said well Alex I like your show it buys phenol a so
[02:27:04.984 --> 02:27:11.149]  And every police officer I see in Austin on the street or the road pulls over and says they're a fan now.
[02:27:11.149 --> 02:27:13.171]  And this is just my microcosm.
[02:27:13.171 --> 02:27:14.972]  I mean, we've reached critical mass.
[02:27:14.972 --> 02:27:20.977]  So just like people now know Bisphenol A is bad, they're changing things with their purchases.
[02:27:20.977 --> 02:27:23.739]  And that's what you're saying is we need to do that with everything.
[02:27:24.813 --> 02:27:25.634]  Everything.
[02:27:25.634 --> 02:27:27.096]  And let me tell you something.
[02:27:27.096 --> 02:27:33.182]  I've seen stories get on corporate media because they're afraid that you're pulling market share from them.
[02:27:33.182 --> 02:27:38.128]  And they can't afford to ignore any money because you're pulling too much traffic.
[02:27:38.128 --> 02:27:39.189]  Well, Yahoo!
[02:27:39.189 --> 02:27:39.890]  Keep it up!
[02:27:39.890 --> 02:27:45.496]  And that's why, you know, if more and more cash is coming into your site, you can provide more and more coverage.
[02:27:46.016 --> 02:27:56.429]  People buying DVDs, buying things from your site, it's going to get them more of the honest media and it's going to shift the corporate media because they're going to be afraid.
[02:27:56.429 --> 02:28:03.699]  So we have the power with our time, our attention, our admiration, our money across the board
[02:28:04.219 --> 02:28:11.126]  Just start voting for the people that you, you know, that you want to represent you and lead you.
[02:28:11.126 --> 02:28:16.611]  Now, let me, I want to cover an area today which to me is so, so, so important.
[02:28:16.611 --> 02:28:18.273]  It's one you've done a lot on.
[02:28:18.273 --> 02:28:23.278]  It's very important, but it's right now, it's at a strategic inflection point, and that's food.
[02:28:24.489 --> 02:28:25.390]  Food.
[02:28:25.390 --> 02:28:32.914]  If there is one thing where a person needs to come up with and say, I don't want to be dependent on the corporate systems.
[02:28:32.914 --> 02:28:35.516]  I don't want to be dependent on industrial agriculture.
[02:28:35.516 --> 02:28:40.940]  I'm going to figure out a way to build and operate, you know, my own food system.
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:43.241]  I'm going to connect with the local farmers.
[02:28:43.241 --> 02:28:45.062]  I'm going to connect with the farmers markets.
[02:28:45.062 --> 02:28:48.644]  I'm going to learn about what food I need to be eating to be healthy.
[02:28:48.644 --> 02:28:50.766]  Because if you feel your children, you know,
[02:28:51.366 --> 02:28:52.526]  We're good to go.
[02:29:10.712 --> 02:29:14.974]  Which is the source of incredible physical strength and intellectual energy.
[02:29:14.974 --> 02:29:17.015]  We're watching come down.
[02:29:17.015 --> 02:29:20.936]  We see people enforcing all over the country on raw milk.
[02:29:20.936 --> 02:29:30.460]  I don't know what you saw several weeks ago with the police coming in with guns drawn to arrest a food club in Venice that was selling raw milk yogurt.
[02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:31.922]  Yes, I did.
[02:29:31.922 --> 02:29:32.722]  Catherine, stay there.
[02:29:32.722 --> 02:29:33.703]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:33.703 --> 02:29:36.223]  We won't be interrupted for 18 minutes afterwards.
[02:29:36.223 --> 02:29:37.324]  Let's come in.
[02:29:37.324 --> 02:29:39.064]  I totally agree with you.
[02:29:39.064 --> 02:29:44.146]  The controllers are manipulating us through the food with chemicals they're adding.
[02:29:44.146 --> 02:29:45.786]  That's one reason to get out of their system.
[02:29:45.786 --> 02:29:48.887]  But also, we've got to become self-sufficient now.
[02:29:48.887 --> 02:29:51.408]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.408 --> 02:29:52.808]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.808 --> 02:29:55.349]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:58.010]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.845 --> 02:30:02.487]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:31:00.353 --> 02:31:04.896]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.896 --> 02:31:05.817]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.817 --> 02:31:09.240]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:10.100]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:14.984]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.984 --> 02:31:15.724]  It's true.
[02:31:15.724 --> 02:31:20.608]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.608 --> 02:31:21.429]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:25.011]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.011 --> 02:31:28.714]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.914 --> 02:31:29.714]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.714 --> 02:31:32.475]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.475 --> 02:31:36.156]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.156 --> 02:31:36.936]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.936 --> 02:31:41.097]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.097 --> 02:31:46.139]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.139 --> 02:31:50.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:52.101]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:03.185]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:32:03.185 --> 02:32:06.967]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:32:06.967 --> 02:32:09.848]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:32:09.848 --> 02:32:14.771]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[02:33:03.814 --> 02:33:08.358]  Solari.com is her excellent website.
[02:33:08.358 --> 02:33:13.542]  Key information, her intellect, full spectrum analysis of the globalist master plan.
[02:33:13.542 --> 02:33:17.225]  I love the term she's coined, like central banking warfare model.
[02:33:20.714 --> 02:33:24.478]  Just amazing stuff there on the site.
[02:33:24.478 --> 02:33:25.639]  Solari.com.
[02:33:25.639 --> 02:33:28.663]  S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[02:33:28.663 --> 02:33:33.968]  Our sites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I do want to tell listeners, I can't help it.
[02:33:33.968 --> 02:33:38.813]  Everybody asks me to do more search terms and soon we're going to have a voting system where you can vote once a week.
[02:33:39.614 --> 02:33:39.714]  And
[02:33:56.411 --> 02:34:11.191]  Crime, C-R-I-M-E, as one word, that is the search term of the day, and we'll turbocharge the Drudge Report link to this scary article about computers, predict what crime will be committed where and by who and when by surveilling your cell phone.
[02:34:11.932 --> 02:34:15.315]  Your power bill, your internet surfing, your bank accounts.
[02:34:15.315 --> 02:34:17.818]  The government's dumping this all into giant databases.
[02:34:17.818 --> 02:34:22.562]  And after we talk about food, I want Catherine Austen Fitts to talk about this surveillance grid.
[02:34:22.562 --> 02:34:28.508]  And Google, in its own words, this is in the article, has purchased a Defense Department-connected company.
[02:34:28.508 --> 02:34:32.451]  And they were funded by, of course, In-Q-Tel, an admitted CIA consortium.
[02:34:32.451 --> 02:34:33.412]  Google itself was.
[02:34:34.113 --> 02:34:35.574]  To quote, predict the future.
[02:34:35.574 --> 02:34:36.615]  I've been telling you this for years.
[02:34:36.615 --> 02:34:38.177]  This is what this is all about.
[02:34:38.177 --> 02:34:51.309]  They can already, over 93% accuracy, just off of following your cell phone beacon with the GPS triangulation, after a few months of watching where you go and what you do, they know patterns of what you're going to do to 93% accuracy.
[02:34:51.309 --> 02:34:52.229]  This is what they admit.
[02:34:53.010 --> 02:34:55.312]  By tracking where you go and what you do.
[02:34:55.312 --> 02:35:05.661]  And they get an entire psychological image of you, and they're violating your Fourth Amendment, but more importantly, they can interject fake data into this, and claim you're a criminal when you're not.
[02:35:05.661 --> 02:35:09.204]  It's just like the behavioral face scanners now in the airports.
[02:35:09.204 --> 02:35:19.973]  They're testing at, what, six airports, that supposedly say your face looked criminal, or major airlines saying the back seat will film and record everything you're saying, and computers will take
[02:35:20.433 --> 02:35:21.754]  The audio of what you're saying.
[02:35:21.754 --> 02:35:25.296]  If you yell at your kids, CPS will be waiting to take them when you land.
[02:35:25.296 --> 02:35:27.117]  I mean, this is what they're admitting.
[02:35:27.117 --> 02:35:28.778]  Everyone will wear taser bracelets.
[02:35:28.778 --> 02:35:30.639]  Homeland Security's looking at that.
[02:35:30.639 --> 02:35:32.400]  So you're all criminals.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:36.583]  But Catherine, continuing with food and other issues, then we'll get into pre-crime.
[02:35:37.762 --> 02:35:43.509]  Okay, so we're watching enforcement against raw milk around the country in ways that are really frightening.
[02:35:43.509 --> 02:35:51.979]  But now, with these egg recalls, we're starting to see articles saying, we need to pasteurize the eggs.
[02:35:51.979 --> 02:35:56.865]  Okay, so what is, after milk, what is one of the great sources of animal protein?
[02:35:59.677 --> 02:36:08.248]  Alex, I can't imagine anything more insane than putting eggs through a process where you destroy all the vitality, nutrition, and life force in them.
[02:36:08.248 --> 02:36:11.152]  So, the patronization of eggs is now coming.
[02:36:12.534 --> 02:36:20.219]  They'd already been promoting that before this happened, and they're talking about not letting family farms have their own eggs, so it's a new level.
[02:36:20.219 --> 02:36:23.581]  They want to radiate them, they want to cook them.
[02:36:23.581 --> 02:36:31.506]  Milk is very healthy, the studies show, until they boil it and pasteurize it, it turns into basically sludge that is deadly to the heart.
[02:36:31.506 --> 02:36:35.168]  So this is the weaponization of the food.
[02:36:35.168 --> 02:36:39.811]  Right, and well, it's the, you know, how did we kill the Indians?
[02:36:39.811 --> 02:36:40.912]  We killed their food supply.
[02:36:41.861 --> 02:36:49.964]  If you want to kill a people in a subtle way, you kill their food first and then you control it and have the remaining population be totally dependent.
[02:36:49.964 --> 02:36:59.927]  So the first thing people can do to help themselves is each person in their own life, their own household, start to build food freedom, food independence.
[02:37:00.687 --> 02:37:06.854]  Um, it is crazy that we're all buying lottery tickets when our small farmers go without capital.
[02:37:06.854 --> 02:37:14.663]  So, you know, start, if you're a tither, start investing in building that local food supply.
[02:37:16.165 --> 02:37:22.874]  Go to the farmers markets or move out to the edge of town.
[02:37:22.874 --> 02:37:24.957]  Austin's actually passed a law where you can have chickens.
[02:37:24.957 --> 02:37:26.158]  A lot of people are doing it.
[02:37:26.158 --> 02:37:29.483]  Have a few chickens and that way everybody's got chickens.
[02:37:29.483 --> 02:37:31.385]  They can't stop us from getting our own eggs.
[02:37:32.401 --> 02:37:33.101]  Right.
[02:37:33.101 --> 02:37:39.565]  And, you know, you have EdibleCommunities.com is starting local food magazines in every area.
[02:37:39.565 --> 02:37:41.006]  Austin has a wonderful one.
[02:37:41.006 --> 02:37:44.068]  You know, that's somebody you might consider having on the show.
[02:37:44.068 --> 02:37:48.951]  And, you know, there are these huge sort of networks growing up, and they're fun.
[02:37:48.951 --> 02:37:49.872]  They're great.
[02:37:49.872 --> 02:37:51.953]  It's a way to meet great people to have a lot of fun.
[02:37:51.953 --> 02:37:58.137]  You know, food brings out the best in us, and fresh food really brings out the best in us.
[02:37:58.137 --> 02:38:01.098]  So, find the people who are building that.
[02:38:01.098 --> 02:38:01.919]  They're food clubs.
[02:38:02.379 --> 02:38:07.063]  There's something called Community Supported Agriculture, CSA, their community garden.
[02:38:07.063 --> 02:38:13.627]  There's just an endless array of things and each one of us, Alex, has to do the thing which is, you know, time convenient.
[02:38:13.627 --> 02:38:23.374]  You want to do this in a way which is convenient and fun for you, but get out of the big grocery stores, get out of corporate, the corporate food is not safe.
[02:38:23.374 --> 02:38:28.158]  That's what, you know, it's so hard for most people to fathom how dangerous
[02:38:30.799 --> 02:38:33.561]  Let me add something to this.
[02:38:33.561 --> 02:38:50.191]  Through my son and some of his homeschooling friends, I've met people that live out in Wimberley and Dripping Springs and I've even thought about trying to move out there but the commute would be over an hour for me to get to my studio from Wimberley and Dripping Springs doesn't seem to be far enough out.
[02:38:50.191 --> 02:38:55.635]  But when I've met these parents, they're lawyers, they're doctors, they're scientists and
[02:38:56.698 --> 02:39:04.283]  Many of them know who I am, but before they ever heard my show, they all know everything about the new world order.
[02:39:04.283 --> 02:39:07.926]  I was out there a few months ago at a camp out for a birthday party.
[02:39:07.926 --> 02:39:09.827]  I was talking to medical doctors.
[02:39:09.827 --> 02:39:16.972]  They knew 15 years ago about the plan to have vaccines that go in and reprogram the brain to make you a submissive zombie.
[02:39:16.972 --> 02:39:19.253]  Now it's being advertised in the news as great.
[02:39:19.253 --> 02:39:21.775]  They knew all about the takeover of food.
[02:39:21.775 --> 02:39:22.756]  They created their own
[02:39:23.456 --> 02:39:25.076]  It was amazing, is what I'm saying.
[02:39:25.076 --> 02:39:27.617]  And now I'm finding that it's spreading all over.
[02:39:27.617 --> 02:39:28.597]  The globalists are scared.
[02:39:51.112 --> 02:39:53.694]  Right, and look at where we've had.
[02:39:53.694 --> 02:39:56.757]  Let's refer to our team as the pro-decentralization team.
[02:39:56.757 --> 02:40:03.584]  We're the people who want, you know, because the New World Order has a plan to modify the central banking warfare.
[02:40:03.584 --> 02:40:09.369]  We need our own plan, and so we've got to reinvent how we do things, and it all starts with food.
[02:40:09.369 --> 02:40:15.275]  And what you'll discover, if you look at where our team has had successes, we were successful in homeschool.
[02:40:16.392 --> 02:40:19.734]  You know, they tried to stop homeschooling and we said, oh no.
[02:40:19.734 --> 02:40:22.875]  And look at it, homeschools growing gangbusters.
[02:40:22.875 --> 02:40:25.677]  Swine flu, they tried to push the swine flu.
[02:40:25.677 --> 02:40:28.418]  Alex, you were enormous in helping to stop that.
[02:40:28.418 --> 02:40:33.000]  But there are too many people who are smart about healthcare now and they couldn't get it done.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.683]  Now, you know, you saw Dr. Mercola's new interview.
[02:40:38.683 --> 02:40:44.206]  He got it up on your website, you know, so now they're trying to integrate it with the normal flu shot to get
[02:40:45.157 --> 02:41:10.404]  And that's what's incredible is the British Medical Journal, the EU Medical Commission, we've had the head of the journal, the editor, and the head of the EU Commission on it, and they conclusively found, premeditated lie, the shots give a tenfold increase in convulsions, massive increases in Guillain-Barré, it was a total hoax, and there was record low of people taking regular seasonal and the H1N1, so we had a record low in the last 20 plus years, this was admitted,
[02:41:11.004 --> 02:41:28.090]  Flu season because people didn't take the flu shots because all the evidence shows it's causing most of the flu, just like the UN's been caught in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the last five years, giving people weaponized polio shots that actually are killing and maiming them.
[02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:32.191]  And so now they're back again saying, you gotta take the flu shot or you're dead.
[02:41:32.191 --> 02:41:37.493]  But as you said, record low of people buying the propaganda.
[02:41:38.867 --> 02:41:46.874]  So what we're watching in the food area is people drawing the line in the sand and saying, no, I will not eat genetically modified food.
[02:41:46.874 --> 02:41:47.774]  It's not safe.
[02:41:47.774 --> 02:41:55.841]  And I will do whatever I have to do to get the right food for my kids because, you know, this is, you know, this is not food.
[02:41:55.841 --> 02:41:57.502]  Food is medicine.
[02:41:57.502 --> 02:41:58.543]  It's not just food.
[02:41:58.543 --> 02:42:03.206]  And when you, when you buy genetically modified food, it's not food, it's poison.
[02:42:03.206 --> 02:42:04.127]  So we have a choice.
[02:42:04.127 --> 02:42:06.589]  We can eat poison or we can eat medicine.
[02:42:07.588 --> 02:42:10.549]  And that's the choice, and too many people are drawing a line in the sand.
[02:42:10.549 --> 02:42:19.330]  So another reason to find the food people is those are the people who understand that death is not the worst thing that can happen, and they're the ones who are going to draw a line in the sand.
[02:42:19.330 --> 02:42:26.592]  And if you look at all... I have a number of friends, Alex, who are top consultants in the whole food industry.
[02:42:26.592 --> 02:42:31.793]  If you look at the market research reports on what people want in terms of fresh,
[02:42:32.453 --> 02:42:34.074]  Local or organic food.
[02:42:34.074 --> 02:42:35.255]  It's off the chart.
[02:42:35.255 --> 02:42:37.857]  I mean, it's growing like gangbusters.
[02:42:37.857 --> 02:42:54.069]  It's growing and the market's there so more people need to invest in developing the clean real food industry and advertising it and deploying it because we can see the controllers worldwide coming in with a new flotilla of food suppression tyranny.
[02:42:54.069 --> 02:42:55.831]  They are trying to head us off at the pass.
[02:42:56.892 --> 02:43:00.498]  Right, and that's why, not surprisingly, what did we just get?
[02:43:00.498 --> 02:43:02.921]  We're getting a new food safety bill.
[02:43:02.921 --> 02:43:09.672]  And you know, in Washington, I used to always say when I was Assistant Secretary of Housing, whatever the name is, it's the opposite.
[02:43:11.829 --> 02:43:14.930]  Well what has the CIA been caught doing hundreds of times?
[02:43:14.930 --> 02:43:22.791]  Releasing microbes, funguses to kill third world crops, releasing grasshoppers by the millions.
[02:43:22.791 --> 02:43:34.834]  They are masters at this and there's clear evidence they've been running false flags in many cases against food supplies and it's always Big Agra that does it, but then they go after the little guy as the supposed solution.
[02:43:36.084 --> 02:43:45.169]  Right, but they can't, you know, so food safety is basically a way to exercise even more, you know, control and concentration of food.
[02:43:45.169 --> 02:43:50.692]  And at the same time that the food safety bill is being negotiated in the Senate, what are we seeing in the market?
[02:43:50.692 --> 02:43:56.375]  We're seeing DHP tender $39 billion for Potash.
[02:43:56.375 --> 02:44:04.260]  What that's all about is clearly they understand behind the scenes that food prices are headed up.
[02:44:05.612 --> 02:44:11.176]  And that this is the premier control point, even more than oil and gas now.
[02:44:11.176 --> 02:44:11.717]  It's food.
[02:44:11.717 --> 02:44:16.621]  And so, just as they understand it and they're making their moves, we need to understand it.
[02:44:16.621 --> 02:44:27.890]  I want everybody listening to this to sit down and say, okay, let's assume food prices for the next three years are going up, you know, 5 to 15% a year for the next three years.
[02:44:27.890 --> 02:44:32.234]  How am I going to jump the curve on that and get higher quality food at lower cost?
[02:44:32.774 --> 02:44:37.238]  And that requires Alex's organization, and there are absolutely ways to do it.
[02:44:37.238 --> 02:44:44.424]  But we need to think, starting very creatively, about, okay, you know, do I join a CSA?
[02:44:44.424 --> 02:44:47.006]  Do I organize with my neighbors and do a food club?
[02:44:47.006 --> 02:44:49.568]  Do we go down and buy wholesale at the terminal market?
[02:44:49.568 --> 02:44:50.229]  How do we do it?
[02:44:50.629 --> 02:44:53.150]  And by the way, that's normal human interaction.
[02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:57.333]  It's fun to be involved in the selling of good food, the growing of it.
[02:44:57.333 --> 02:45:08.399]  This is real humanity out there in the mud and the dirt and the grass, you know, with goats and chickens running around, not watching glowing TV screens and gobbling Prozac, but expanding on that.
[02:45:09.548 --> 02:45:17.335]  Expanding briefly, my father about a year ago said, I'm suddenly seeing water well drillers all over Austin.
[02:45:17.335 --> 02:45:19.097]  I didn't know you could drill a well in Austin.
[02:45:19.097 --> 02:45:25.143]  We found out there's certain zones they don't let you in the name of water quality, but there are many areas in Austin and Travis County you can.
[02:45:25.623 --> 02:45:33.429]  And then I saw a newscast about thousands of wells being drilled, and I called up one of the biggest companies in the newscast, and they said, oh, hi, Alex.
[02:45:33.429 --> 02:45:34.590]  Yeah, we know who you are.
[02:45:34.590 --> 02:45:39.373]  They said a lot of people that are calling us and get, in fact, I meant to have them on.
[02:45:39.373 --> 02:45:41.055]  I never told the producers to get them on.
[02:45:42.242 --> 02:45:46.763]  That they're afraid the government's going to stop them from being able to have a well.
[02:45:46.763 --> 02:45:48.584]  They didn't even know they could have a well.
[02:45:48.584 --> 02:45:54.445]  So suddenly middle class and wealthy people, the well drilling rigs are just all over town.
[02:45:54.445 --> 02:46:03.647]  They're coming in from all over Texas to drill because the people instinctively know that the globalists are coming in buying up water supplies and they've got to get wells grandfathered.
[02:46:03.647 --> 02:46:06.788]  So we're really seeing people quietly getting ready.
[02:46:08.137 --> 02:46:21.439]  Well, you know, I'm an investment advisor, and I'm constantly saying to people, you know, why are you complaining that your yields are dropping on your investments, and your water bill is going up?
[02:46:21.439 --> 02:46:22.980]  This is really simple.
[02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:25.640]  The water that you're buying is not safe.
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:31.901]  Get your money, you know, stop financing the water companies in the stock market who then provide you with unsafe water.
[02:46:31.901 --> 02:46:34.582]  Why don't you just go build your own well?
[02:46:34.582 --> 02:46:36.642]  And that's why they're moving to block rainwater collection.
[02:46:37.557 --> 02:46:45.708]  Right, absolutely, because 20 years from now, water will be considered far more precious than oil and gas.
[02:46:45.708 --> 02:46:49.173]  Water in sunlight is the source and oxygen.
[02:46:52.037 --> 02:46:58.102]  And so, you know, when I, Alex, I live out in the country, I have my own well.
[02:46:58.102 --> 02:46:59.043]  I tested the water.
[02:46:59.043 --> 02:47:14.035]  Lehman's wonderful store that supplies the Amish has a great water test, and my water tested perfectly, and I still got a whole house water filter because I was still afraid of what Chemtrails might do to the water table.
[02:47:15.379 --> 02:47:19.502]  You know, so there's nothing more important than having excellent water.
[02:47:19.502 --> 02:47:36.575]  And so this is an area where everybody listening to this show, if your takeaway is, I'm going to think about how to create healthy, redundant sources of food and water and withdraw from the system because that's going to be one of the major, major control points.
[02:47:37.282 --> 02:47:48.532]  And the other thing to say, because if you look at what's going to happen with the economy, what's happening now, what's going to happen next year, I want everybody to sit down and say, I need to get radical about my time.
[02:47:48.532 --> 02:47:57.180]  How can I cut out of my life every connection to the big systems, the big governments, the big corporations?
[02:47:57.180 --> 02:48:01.784]  How can I reduce my interaction and my dependency in a way that saves me time?
[02:48:01.784 --> 02:48:03.286]  Because you're going to need that time.
[02:48:03.866 --> 02:48:06.228]  To build these new networks and these connections.
[02:48:06.228 --> 02:48:09.831]  You're going to need time to really rethink how you do food.
[02:48:09.831 --> 02:48:13.994]  So, you know, turn off corporate news.
[02:48:13.994 --> 02:48:15.335]  Get radical.
[02:48:15.335 --> 02:48:20.619]  If you're doing things because you think it's so, you know, it looks right, you need to stop that.
[02:48:20.619 --> 02:48:26.444]  You need every minute of your time to build energy for you and your family.
[02:48:26.444 --> 02:48:29.927]  Because next year we're going to have lots of different systems
[02:48:30.527 --> 02:48:35.609]  Going through unbelievable change, and it's going to put unbelievable pressure on your time.
[02:48:35.609 --> 02:48:37.950]  Well, there are more people and systems in crisis.
[02:48:37.950 --> 02:48:46.014]  Well, I want to, in the final segment, and as we go on a break, talk about the changes from your financial expertise that we're going into and how serious it's going to get.
[02:48:46.014 --> 02:48:53.237]  But 7 million people, major university studies have shown, we've covered them here, starved in the 10 years of the Depression, it's estimated.
[02:48:53.237 --> 02:48:57.259]  They would get compromised immune systems from malnutrition and die.
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:48:59.760]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:49:29.463 --> 02:49:33.324]  Start being as useful as you can to your neighbors and the people in your network.
[02:49:33.324 --> 02:49:39.726]  That's how you... By being useful with everybody else, that's how we find the opportunities to build.
[02:49:39.726 --> 02:49:42.867]  Because what we're really looking to do is build resiliency.
[02:49:42.867 --> 02:49:48.629]  And by really being able to help each other, and do it without going through the big system.
[02:49:50.319 --> 02:49:51.580]  Well, we've got to do it now.
[02:49:51.580 --> 02:49:53.522]  Stop buying the Walmart junk.
[02:49:53.522 --> 02:49:54.663]  Start investing.
[02:49:54.663 --> 02:49:58.207]  And my dad looked into drilling a well on his little piece of property.
[02:49:58.207 --> 02:50:00.509]  He's got three acres in town.
[02:50:00.509 --> 02:50:02.211]  And it's not zoned.
[02:50:02.211 --> 02:50:03.672]  He's not allowed to.
[02:50:03.672 --> 02:50:06.776]  But I mean, I'm to the point of I wish there were drilling companies.
[02:50:06.776 --> 02:50:08.157]  It's time to start rebelling.
[02:50:08.157 --> 02:50:09.859]  You know, we're allowed to have our own water.
[02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:18.867]  Did you see last year where a major city in Oklahoma, Tucson, said people may grow marijuana in their gardens?
[02:50:18.867 --> 02:50:25.133]  We want a law to have inspections of gardens to make sure backyard gardens aren't growing marijuana.
[02:50:25.133 --> 02:50:25.894]  Pre-crime!
[02:50:25.894 --> 02:50:27.476]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[02:50:28.616 --> 02:50:29.937]  Oh my word.
[02:50:29.937 --> 02:50:45.022]  You know, it's amazing because having gone through litigation with the federal government, I went through 18 audits and investigations and on several occasions, Alex, we were able to prove and document it all up on the web that they tried to falsify evidence against us.
[02:50:46.042 --> 02:50:49.284]  And that's before they had this kind of technology.
[02:50:49.284 --> 02:50:56.788]  And it's another reason you want to be really involved with community and transparent within that community about what you're doing.
[02:50:56.788 --> 02:50:57.308]  Exactly.
[02:50:57.308 --> 02:50:57.789]  Stay there.
[02:50:57.789 --> 02:50:58.649]  So you got witnesses.
[02:50:58.649 --> 02:50:59.429]  So you got witnesses.
[02:50:59.429 --> 02:50:59.970]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.388 --> 02:51:01.988]  Attention!
[02:51:01.988 --> 02:51:06.989]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[02:51:06.989 --> 02:51:12.690]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[02:51:12.690 --> 02:51:19.831]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:51:19.831 --> 02:51:28.573]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:51:29.793 --> 02:51:32.934]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:51:32.934 --> 02:51:39.778]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:51:39.778 --> 02:51:48.722]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[02:51:48.722 --> 02:51:53.344]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[02:51:53.524 --> 02:51:53.845]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again 800-902-6969
[02:52:01.533 --> 02:52:06.497]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.497 --> 02:52:07.477]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.477 --> 02:52:09.939]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.939 --> 02:52:10.960]  A republic.
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:13.602]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.602 --> 02:52:15.864]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.864 --> 02:52:17.885]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.885 --> 02:52:19.566]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.566 --> 02:52:20.887]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.887 --> 02:52:21.488]  Children?
[02:52:21.488 --> 02:52:22.609]  Our education?
[02:52:22.609 --> 02:52:23.449]  Our money?
[02:52:23.449 --> 02:52:27.092]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.452 --> 02:52:31.158]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:31.158 --> 02:52:32.420]  You're being warned.
[02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:33.462]  We have the facts.
[02:52:33.462 --> 02:52:34.623]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.623 --> 02:52:35.525]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.525 --> 02:52:36.406]  We have common law.
[02:52:36.406 --> 02:52:38.930]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:38.930 --> 02:52:42.716]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:42.816 --> 02:52:47.759]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:47.759 --> 02:52:49.260]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:49.260 --> 02:52:50.340]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:50.340 --> 02:52:56.784]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:53:01.624 --> 02:53:03.465]  No one likes foreclosure.
[02:53:03.465 --> 02:53:08.366]  You won't say, think, or even consider foreclosure with ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:53:08.366 --> 02:53:08.826]  Why?
[02:53:08.826 --> 02:53:17.329]  Because ZeroDebtGuarantee.com guarantees to stop your foreclosure for at least two years with no payments, no bankruptcy, and no negotiating.
[02:53:17.329 --> 02:53:18.769]  Thinking loan modification?
[02:53:18.769 --> 02:53:20.170]  That still keeps you in default.
[02:53:20.450 --> 02:53:29.292]  Zero debt in 90 days is the only proven system that keeps you in your house for as long as you want to stay, while making it possible to even get clear title to your house.
[02:53:29.292 --> 02:53:32.693]  No, we are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.

[02:53:48.720 --> 02:53:49.941]  Or visit ZerodetGuaranteed.com.
[02:53:49.941 --> 02:53:51.562]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[02:53:51.562 --> 02:53:53.263]  Final segment with Kathryn Austin Fitch, Solari.com.
[02:54:09.966 --> 02:54:16.331]  We've got the story mirrored that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.net in case those sites have any traffic problems.
[02:54:16.331 --> 02:54:18.992]  GCNlive.com.
[02:54:18.992 --> 02:54:20.954]  The network site has it in full.
[02:54:20.954 --> 02:54:22.155]  GCNlive.com.
[02:54:22.155 --> 02:54:25.897]  Computers predict what crime will be committed, where and by whom, and when.
[02:54:25.897 --> 02:54:27.198]  Total surveillance.
[02:54:27.198 --> 02:54:29.100]  Another video we didn't have a chance to play today.
[02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:30.641]  Constitution is silly stuff.
[02:54:31.161 --> 02:54:36.187]  The same Illinois Congressman that said he doesn't care about the Constitution earlier this year.
[02:54:36.187 --> 02:54:38.910]  Congressman Phil Hare has said it again.
[02:54:38.910 --> 02:54:41.233]  That's up at GCNlive.com.
[02:54:41.233 --> 02:54:48.301]  And an Infowars.com reader was arrested when he saw the police handcuffing a woman who they let go during a traffic stop.
[02:54:48.301 --> 02:54:50.844]  He called them Nazis, so they came over to his house and arrested him.
[02:54:51.465 --> 02:54:54.627]  And the point is, it's not nice to call him that, but it is his First Amendment.
[02:54:54.627 --> 02:54:56.249]  That's up at GCNlive.com.
[02:54:56.249 --> 02:55:01.552]  But Catherine, finishing up in the last five minutes, what type of collapse are you talking about?
[02:55:01.552 --> 02:55:03.454]  Are the big changes in the next year?
[02:55:03.454 --> 02:55:04.695]  What's the time frame?
[02:55:04.695 --> 02:55:08.798]  And your final comment on all this Big Brother control system they're racing to put in place?
[02:55:10.207 --> 02:55:12.568]  You know, Alex, I don't think we're looking at a collapse.
[02:55:12.568 --> 02:55:15.850]  I think we're looking... We've been in what I call a slow burn.
[02:55:15.850 --> 02:55:18.271]  I think the slow burn is going to continue.
[02:55:18.271 --> 02:55:27.255]  In the slow burn, you have insiders and outsiders, and the insiders protect themselves and financial assets by basically draining the outsiders.
[02:55:28.010 --> 02:55:44.862]  And what we're going to see, you know, among the outsiders is we're going to have to see a reconciling of overheads, whether in households, in state and local government, in small business, to much reduced cash flows and much higher expenses.
[02:55:44.862 --> 02:55:55.349]  And so, you know, the outsiders are going to continue to get drained and are going to have to, you know, the change is accelerating and that's, you know, it's almost
[02:55:55.996 --> 02:55:57.998]  A grinding of the gears.
[02:55:57.998 --> 02:56:06.424]  And as that happens, you're going to look for more and more controls instituted by the guys in the top so that they can continue to manage a process.
[02:56:06.424 --> 02:56:08.226]  Now, that's North America.
[02:56:08.226 --> 02:56:23.338]  What we're watching globally, it's an effort to rebalance the global economy from one that's sort of in, or where the motor is the American consumer, to one that's rebalanced to the global consumers.
[02:56:23.860 --> 02:56:32.187]  You're going to see that rebalancing going on as more and more assets continue to be moved out of ownership and control of government into corporations.
[02:56:32.187 --> 02:56:42.356]  Because we're looking for, you know, what they're looking for is a corporate-managed planet that is much more top-down controlled.
[02:56:42.356 --> 02:56:47.120]  And that's a global plan, and so we're watching them sort of proceed to do that.
[02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:50.963]  And with $12 trillion to bear off, they have mighty resources to do it.
[02:56:51.542 --> 02:56:58.768]  And that's why, you know, what you always hear me say is don't worry about whether or not there is a conspiracy.
[02:56:58.768 --> 02:57:01.270]  If you're not in one, you need to start one.
[02:57:01.270 --> 02:57:05.553]  Because we're watching the planet that's being managed by conspiracies.
[02:57:05.553 --> 02:57:12.478]  So if we want to provide an alternative to the central banking warfare model, we have to start conspiring.
[02:57:12.478 --> 02:57:16.882]  And it starts by conspiring in ways that protect you on the outside.
[02:57:17.423 --> 02:57:29.806]  Because we're looking at a situation where your time is going to be more stressed than your time, your income is probably going to be under pressure to drop, your expense is rising, and you need to jump the curve on that.
[02:57:29.806 --> 02:57:36.867]  And that's going to require a conspiracy, literally, for us to start to circulate more of our cash flows to each other.
[02:57:36.867 --> 02:57:44.529]  Because right now, we continue to shoot our cash, whether it's purchases or investments or bank deposits or donations, back to them.
[02:57:45.209 --> 02:57:48.670]  We're financing the guy who's shooting at us.
[02:57:48.670 --> 02:57:58.874]  And so it's going to take, you know, conspiracies in your network and in your local area to start saying, okay, what are my short-term problems?
[02:57:58.874 --> 02:57:59.914]  How do I start to
[02:57:59.974 --> 02:58:00.795]  Absolutely, but you know something?
[02:58:00.795 --> 02:58:02.456]  We can create a lot more wealth than we can, so we can win.
[02:58:25.916 --> 02:58:29.561]  And you've got a lot of that key information at Solari.com.
[02:58:29.561 --> 02:58:32.785]  Catherine Austin Fitts, thanks for spending time with us on your vacation.
[02:58:32.785 --> 02:58:33.666]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:33.666 --> 02:58:34.987]  Have a great day.
[02:58:34.987 --> 02:58:35.348]  You too.
[02:58:35.348 --> 02:58:36.469]  You're awesome.
[02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:39.193]  Ladies and gentlemen, the search term is pre-crime.
[02:58:39.193 --> 02:58:39.974]  Pre-crime.
[02:58:39.974 --> 02:58:40.655]  Get it out to everybody.
