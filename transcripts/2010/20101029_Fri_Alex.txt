[00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.430]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.131]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.091]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:10.451]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:12.152]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:16.593]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:21.014]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.477]  It is Friday, the 29th day of October 2010.
[00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:33.600]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, as we are every weekday, 11 a.m.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.020]  to 2 p.m.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.380]  Central.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.401]  Many days we go over at the fourth hour.
[00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.443]  Then, of course, I return live this Sunday for the abbreviated transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:42.624]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:45.077 --> 00:01:00.155]  Obviously they've got all of the suspicious package bomb threat hysteria going ahead of the election right now with two UPS planes stopped on the East Coast in Newark, New Jersey and of course in Philadelphia.
[00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:05.507]  They're also tracking down UPS vehicles in Queens, New York.
[00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:16.612]  And it all started in England, they admit, dealing with a suspicious box from Yemen with a printer ink cartridge in it.
[00:01:17.513 --> 00:01:18.433]  Very scary.
[00:01:19.074 --> 00:01:26.097]  But if we give up all of our rights and give all of our tax money to foreign banks, they will protect us.
[00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:27.558]  Remember that.
[00:01:28.973 --> 00:01:37.841]  When our grandchildren ask why we live in such a police state, you tell them, honey, it's because, you know, the government wanted to protect us from evil men with turbines on their heads.
[00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.403]  The government wasn't involved in any of the terror.
[00:01:40.763 --> 00:01:43.806]  The government hated the takeover and all the trillions they were able to steal.
[00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:46.048]  They just did it to protect us, okay?
[00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.150]  And the bankers took your pension funds.
[00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:51.893]  They're getting ready to take your pension funds to keep you safe.
[00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:55.878]  To keep you safe from financial collapse as well.
[00:01:56.419 --> 00:02:03.204]  And they're trying to put carbon taxes on California and other states to keep us safe from the oceans rising and killing us.
[00:02:03.925 --> 00:02:04.786]  It's all real.
[00:02:04.846 --> 00:02:15.134]  Global warming, Al Qaeda terrorism, the Headless Horseman, the Easter Bunny, it's all real.
[00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:16.736]  Santa Claus is real.
[00:02:18.197 --> 00:02:19.338]  Santa Claus is real.
[00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.460]  He keeps you safe from Al Qaeda.
[00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:23.516]  Alright, I'm going to get serious here.
[00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:26.759]  We'll break down this ridiculous propaganda of fear-mongering.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.985]  Who knows, they may even produce some fake bombs or something for everybody to remind you of how much they care about you.
[00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:35.648]  I want to recap that last Christmas' attack...
[00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:38.256]  Was staged by the government.
[00:02:38.677 --> 00:02:46.800]  Muttalib was clearly drugged out of his gourd, drooling, disheveled, led on the plane by US intelligence personnel.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.421]  State Department admits they were ordered to help get him on the plane and then his underwear popped.
[00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:56.603]  I guess some type of black cat firecracker in his underwear and his knickers.
[00:02:56.683 --> 00:03:02.905]  So, again, gotta give all your rights up, because in America, we give our rights up when anybody attacks us.
[00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:07.206]  And in every case, the government's holding the terrorist's hand right to them.
[00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:11.247]  It's like Anwar al-Awlaki, Fox News two weeks ago.
[00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:12.728]  Yeah, he dined at the Pentagon.
[00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.741]  Two months after 9-11, he's on the news as the number three in Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:20.503]  He wants to get us, and he's in secret meetings at the Pentagon.
[00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:22.425]  But, hey, that's no big deal, okay?
[00:03:23.325 --> 00:03:27.148]  We've got to give our rights up, or Al-Awlaki is going to get us!
[00:03:27.788 --> 00:03:29.129]  He's scary looking!
[00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.091]  He wears a hood!
[00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.533]  He's got a little mustache and beard!
[00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.535]  He doesn't look like us.
[00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:37.936]  He's scary!
[00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:40.756]  Alright, alright.
[00:03:40.856 --> 00:03:42.321]  I said I'd stop the satire.
[00:03:42.782 --> 00:03:44.587]  I just can't handle it anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:46.172]  You wanna know who the terrorists are?
[00:03:48.217 --> 00:03:49.138]  People that run our government.
[00:03:49.818 --> 00:03:52.179]  You wanna know who finances most of the radical Muslims?
[00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.461]  The occasional real nutball that can get to attack us?
[00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:56.122]  The government.
[00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:58.463]  I mean, what came out in AP and Reuters this week?
[00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:01.345]  Oh, it's FBI staging terror!
[00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:09.189]  They go out and find mentally deranged people and their al-Qaeda contact is the FBI, is the CIA, ordering them to attack!
[00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.852]  The government doesn't just infiltrate terrorist groups, they go out and they create them!
[00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:19.029]  And they find drugged-out, lunatic nutcases.
[00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.129]  Listen, folks, anybody.
[00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.491]  I could spend a month and go out and find schizophrenic homeless people.
[00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.972]  Hypothetically, I'd never do this.
[00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:40.519]  But you could go out, spend a month, give a few thousand dollars to schizophrenic homeless people, and I can assure you, you, without even knowing psychological tactics, could get them to bring some firecrackers into a police station and set them on fire.
[00:04:41.326 --> 00:04:45.131]  And then it'd be, ahh, ahh, bobs, ahh, ahh, get my rights up!
[00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:48.394]  Now, would I be guilty if I got a homeless person to go do that?
[00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:48.735]  Yes.
[00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:50.737]  Well, is the government guilty?
[00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:51.818]  You bet they are.
[00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:53.460]  Look, it's all coming up.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.502]  The economy, you name it.
[00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:55.263]  Massive news.
[00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:57.505]  Big guest coming up on this Friday transmission.
[00:04:57.705 --> 00:04:58.286]  Hoorah!

[00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:53.730]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.843]  Alright, I'm about to tell you about who's coming up on this live Friday transmission.
[00:08:12.863 --> 00:08:20.448]  The fear-mongering over, first they said UPS, now they're saying it's not UPS with these aircraft grounded on the East Coast.
[00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:23.290]  Lots of fear-mongering going on on that front.
[00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.153]  We're getting new affiliates every week and I want to thank
[00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:28.893]  Some of those affiliates.
[00:08:28.913 --> 00:08:34.776]  In the last two months we've been carried in Dallas, the sixth largest market in the country, on Sundays.
[00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:37.497]  They re-air the show at 6 p.m.
[00:08:37.697 --> 00:08:41.159]  on KILF, one of the biggest talk stations in the state.
[00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:48.842]  And now AM 1630, KKGM is going to carry the show noon to 2, the last two hours of the weekday show, live.
[00:08:49.422 --> 00:08:50.643]  It's 1630 a.m.
[00:08:50.743 --> 00:08:58.448]  it covers all of Dallas Fort Worth all of Arlington and many other counties around it big blowtorch a.m.
[00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:04.932]  1630 KKGM for listeners in the Dallas area that listen on shortwave satellite or internet.
[00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:10.135]  Or to the Sunday KILF rebroadcast of the Sunday show.
[00:09:10.155 --> 00:09:11.776]  They air it right when the show ends, they re-air it.
[00:09:12.557 --> 00:09:15.298]  So we're now on AM 1630 KKGM.
[00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:18.260]  Big, big, big station.
[00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:24.385]  And so we are very, very excited about 1630 picking the show up starting next Monday.
[00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:26.126]  And that is official, done, deal.
[00:09:26.486 --> 00:09:28.547]  Very excited about that.
[00:09:29.148 --> 00:09:34.471]  Because, look, a lot of stations in the past have said, look, Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:41.241]  And we like his positions on the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Libertarian Ideas.
[00:09:41.621 --> 00:09:43.304]  We know he's a popular talk show host.
[00:09:43.324 --> 00:09:44.526]  We know he gets good ratings.
[00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:47.650]  We know that, but we don't like 9-11 truth.
[00:09:49.076 --> 00:10:02.345]  Well, now the stations are calling up saying, look, it's on Fox News that the number one head of Al Qaeda, number three on 9-11, was at the Pentagon meeting with Brass two months after when there was an arrest warrant out for him.
[00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:15.974]  And it's come out, Operation Northwood's the plan to stage 9-11, and the Gulf of Tonkin's been declassified, and all these videos have been released of bombs going off in the towers, and the FBI director's saying it, and, you know, I guess he's right.
[00:10:16.034 --> 00:10:17.936]  I guess he isn't as radical as we first thought.
[00:10:18.556 --> 00:10:20.783]  This information is unstoppable.
[00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:23.051]  I just tell the truth, okay?
[00:10:23.412 --> 00:10:23.873]  Period.
[00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:24.776]  Period.
[00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:35.925]  And it's very simple, and you know now Michael Savage every week talks about Obama planning clearly to hype up terror and stage terror attacks in the U.S.
[00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:38.127]  A lot of other mainstream hosts are talking about it.
[00:10:38.507 --> 00:10:44.292]  And so government-sponsored terrorism inside job is now an issue that has become very, very mainstream.
[00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:47.354]  Oklahoma City, clear inside job.
[00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:52.598]  And presidents come and go, but these staged events, they continue.
[00:10:53.198 --> 00:10:55.100]  And so many other things.
[00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:58.470]  have come out concerning government-sponsored terror.
[00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:15.553]  I mean, it's Associated Press, it's the Detroit Free Press, it is mainstream news, two months after we told you last year, in December, the Christmas Day underwear bombing, that Muttalib was led on the plane by an agent of the U.S.
[00:11:15.593 --> 00:11:19.994]  government, that he was protected, that the State Department was ordered to help get him on the plane.
[00:11:20.214 --> 00:11:24.295]  That's the Undersecretary of the State Department, Mr. Kennedy, the head of visas globally.
[00:11:24.995 --> 00:11:29.562]  He got under heat saying, how did he get on without all this stuff, without a passport?
[00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:31.625]  How did the U.S.
[00:11:31.985 --> 00:11:32.985]  help get him a visa?
[00:11:33.566 --> 00:11:36.226]  Then he didn't even have it that day, but they still helped him get on.
[00:11:36.486 --> 00:11:39.447]  And he said, look, I was ordered to do this by an unnamed U.S.
[00:11:39.507 --> 00:11:40.547]  intelligence agency.
[00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:44.708]  Two months before that was in the news, who did we have on the show?
[00:11:45.488 --> 00:11:46.808]  Kurt Haskell, the lawyer.
[00:11:47.068 --> 00:11:52.329]  His wife saw the same thing on the plane from Europe, from Amsterdam to Detroit.
[00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:54.830]  The FBI came to his office and told him, you're wrong.
[00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.030]  Shut up, basically.
[00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.671]  He said, I'm not going to shut up.
[00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.711]  And then other witnesses on the plane went public.
[00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:04.171]  Okay, and then it came out that it was all true.
[00:12:04.852 --> 00:12:07.133]  Why would Kurt Haskell and the other witnesses lie?
[00:12:07.653 --> 00:12:07.954]  Okay?
[00:12:08.714 --> 00:12:09.475]  It's on record.
[00:12:10.255 --> 00:12:17.800]  And they were on the airplane videotaping Muttalib, somebody, a sharp-dressed guy, through the entire 12-14 hour flight.
[00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:22.904]  And all of this is coming out.
[00:12:23.184 --> 00:12:23.684]  All of this.
[00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:45.097]  Anwar al-Awlaki, the CIA lackey, who on record was in command of the Fort Hood shooter, in command of the Christmas Day dud bomber, a few months ago the Times Square event.
[00:12:46.638 --> 00:12:47.439]  This is the guy
[00:12:50.933 --> 00:13:19.489]  This is the guy who is in charge of all of this stuff, and we know with Major Hassan at Fort Hood, for two years, he was sending emails to Anwar al-Awlaki, reportedly getting orders from him on what he was supposed to do, and it even came out in mainstream news, you can pull this up, we covered it at the time, when they had the Fort Hood shooting,
[00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:32.520]  That this is so important that the Pentagon and the CIA knew all about it and didn't warn Fort Hood, didn't warn the other bases that this psychiatrist, Major Hassan, was at.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.121]  And that they allowed it to happen.
[00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:38.403]  And they were having a drill that day of a mass shooting.
[00:13:38.563 --> 00:13:39.864]  And another drill the day before.
[00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:50.856]  And at the time, witnesses at Fort Hood said they took our cell phones and they made us erase the video of the shooting and there were reports of multiple shooters.
[00:13:51.137 --> 00:13:53.058]  So we don't even know what really happened there.
[00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:55.219]  Now it's come out in court two weeks ago.
[00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.171]  That indeed, they've been ordered to erase the cell phone footage.
[00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:03.492]  Exactly what we heard at the time.
[00:14:04.192 --> 00:14:09.693]  Now, this guy, Anwar al-Awlaki, it's why I spent so much time on it last week, and these are facts!
[00:14:10.073 --> 00:14:13.774]  This doesn't go away just because some people want it to, or because it's scary.
[00:14:13.934 --> 00:14:15.255]  I'm sorry, it's the truth!
[00:14:15.795 --> 00:14:25.297]  That Anwar al-Awlaki, two months after 9-11, was at the Pentagon in a secret meeting with the entire top brass, including the Secretary of the Army.
[00:14:26.462 --> 00:14:30.543]  This is two months after he's all over the news as the number three in Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:30.743 --> 00:14:33.684]  They now say he's the number one in Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:35.465 --> 00:14:36.505]  Who's the number three now?
[00:14:37.725 --> 00:14:46.688]  Adam Gadahn, the admitted grandson of the former head of the ADL, who got arrested beating up Arabs outside Mosque twelve years ago.
[00:14:47.048 --> 00:14:49.809]  Then, he's Jewish, he becomes
[00:14:50.871 --> 00:14:58.476]  The American spokesman for Al-Qaeda with a turban and a beard, popping up every time a president, you know, says, Al-Qaeda's about to get us!
[00:14:59.036 --> 00:15:00.717]  And then he pops up and says, yes we are!
[00:15:01.178 --> 00:15:01.958]  Right on time!
[00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:06.982]  And then of course, Wired Magazine and others, at major digital conferences,
[00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:27.597]  Looked at the videos of these Al-Qaeda leaders being uploaded to the web and found that the Intel Center, run by former directors of Black Ops and the CIA and the Pentagon, adjuncts of Donald Rumsfeld, that the Intel Center uploaded their logo over it with, in the same video layer, as the Al-Qaeda logo.
[00:15:27.617 --> 00:15:29.058]  You understand that?
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.562]  You know, we're not video geniuses, but we understand video layers here.
[00:15:33.903 --> 00:15:46.331]  I'd even done that before it was news, and blown it up on our big screen plasma screens back there, and looked at the video layers, and you can tell the pixelation was the same in the layer when you blow it up.
[00:15:46.651 --> 00:15:47.732]  We'd already talked about that.
[00:15:47.932 --> 00:15:53.376]  I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I knew that Fat Bin Laden, whose nose had grown by an inch,
[00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:57.652]  Sitting around, supposedly getting drunk with young boys.
[00:15:57.672 --> 00:15:58.673]  Remember that footage?
[00:15:59.373 --> 00:16:00.114]  Nine years ago?
[00:16:01.414 --> 00:16:02.955]  Right after 9-11, a few months after?
[00:16:04.015 --> 00:16:06.076]  I could look at it and tell you it wasn't Bin Laden.
[00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:14.180]  The CIA told Spy Talk five months ago, in the Washington Post, that yes, the government put out that fake video.
[00:16:15.472 --> 00:16:17.672]  Well, I don't need them to tell me it's fake.
[00:16:18.093 --> 00:16:23.494]  I mean, it'd be literally like sticking a beard on me and putting a fake nose on me and saying it was Bin Laden.
[00:16:23.614 --> 00:16:25.094]  It looked nothing like him!
[00:16:25.534 --> 00:16:30.495]  Then, they put out a computer-generated Bin Laden video that looked like something from a cheap video game.
[00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:32.935]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:16:33.335 --> 00:16:37.496]  And don't forget, I told you in 2004, 2005, 2006, that they were issuing fake terror alerts for political gain.
[00:16:41.457 --> 00:16:47.224]  Then Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, got up at a press conference and said these have been issued for political gain.
[00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:49.807]  I guess to protect himself, he didn't want to be part of it.
[00:16:50.148 --> 00:16:58.358]  And then Ridge writes a book that's published last year, the former head of Homeland Security, saying he was pressured to issue fake terror alerts ahead of elections.
[00:16:58.598 --> 00:17:00.601]  Look, we're only covering the facts here.
[00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:04.303]  I mean, do you want me to not tell you that Anwar al-Awlaki is at the Pentagon?
[00:17:04.624 --> 00:17:10.068]  Do you not want me to open up Newsweek right after 9-11 when they admittedly said the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:17:10.088 --> 00:17:12.930]  military bases, AP, Washington Post?
[00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.231]  They just hide it in plain view?
[00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:19.535]  Or that six of the ten 9-11 commissioners say they were lied to and they weren't allowed to truly investigate?
[00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:25.139]  I mean, facts are facts are facts are facts.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.060]  Period.
[00:17:26.521 --> 00:17:27.222]  End of story.
[00:17:27.542 --> 00:17:28.463]  That's the way it is.
[00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:31.146]  It doesn't change because we want them to.
[00:17:31.387 --> 00:17:34.230]  I wish every day it was Muslim extremists.
[00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.093]  I wish every day, because that's not scary.
[00:17:37.814 --> 00:17:41.817]  I'm not scared of a few hundred lunatics running around with turbines on their heads.
[00:17:42.197 --> 00:17:43.518]  But I'll tell you what I am scared of.
[00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:52.805]  A globalist corporate takeover that wants to set up a police state for the American people, staging events and allowing lunatics to attack us as a pretext to take our rights.
[00:17:53.065 --> 00:18:00.370]  And as I told you nine years ago, and as I put my police state films 12, 13 years ago, and as is on record now,
[00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:13.197]  95% or more of all of the Homeland Security apparatus, this is New York Times, Washington Post, but we got the secret documents last year, MIAC and Homeland Security from law enforcement, confirmed to be real.
[00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:17.899]  95%, the number one threat, returning veterans with guns.
[00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:36.700]  Conservatives, Libertarians, Land Rights Activists, Anti-Global Warming Activists, Ron Paul Supporters, Bob Barr Supporters, Libertarian Supporters, Chuck Baldwin Supporters, people that like Aaron Russo's film exposing the IRS, America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:41.684]  That's who they say the number one enemy is.
[00:18:42.384 --> 00:18:46.607]  And all these new Southern Poverty Law Center ADL reports, who do they say the number one evil?
[00:18:46.967 --> 00:18:47.688]  Alex Jones.
[00:18:48.775 --> 00:18:49.916]  I'm not going to hurt a fly.
[00:18:50.256 --> 00:18:51.577]  I'm not going to blow anything up.
[00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:53.078]  I'm fighting against violence.
[00:18:53.378 --> 00:19:00.203]  I want to, through our Constitution, take our government back the way we're supposed to, legally and lawfully and constitutionally.
[00:19:00.503 --> 00:19:08.188]  But they want to stage events and terror events to demonize the American people and shut down the true political process in this country.
[00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:11.010]  And we've got to get out ahead of these staged terror events.
[00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:18.335]  Because those of you Republicans that won't wake up to 9-11, you better wake up when Barry Sotaro, aka Barack Obama's people,
[00:19:19.015 --> 00:19:19.776]  Set something off.
[00:19:20.116 --> 00:19:36.125]  We've read all the quotes by his people in his White House, the Financial Times of London and others, saying, without an Oklahoma City or a new 9-11, Barack Obama won't be able to look strong for the public, and Oklahoma City saved Bill Clinton when he was in the low 40s, went to the high 60s, right before the election, with the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:19:36.165 --> 00:19:37.186]  That saved Bill Clinton.
[00:19:37.566 --> 00:19:38.927]  We need another terror attack!
[00:19:39.207 --> 00:19:41.929]  They're so dumb, they're right out in the open bragging about it!
[00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:43.069]  But I'll read it.
[00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.892]  When we come back, I'll briefly get into the latest fear-mongering hysteria.
[00:19:48.243 --> 00:19:50.984]  Soon we'll be shutting our doors and windows, shutting out fresh air for months.
[00:19:51.564 --> 00:19:56.406]  Did you know you're also keeping in allergens, bacteria, and germs that cause colds and flu?
[00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:59.427]  What if there was a low-cost way of blanketing your home with clean air?

[00:21:29.232 --> 00:21:38.498]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:39.299]  This capitalism?
[00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:45.503]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:45.623 --> 00:21:46.444]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:46.484 --> 00:21:49.586]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:24:09.472 --> 00:24:14.016]  Oh, it's the end of the Democrat-controlled House for sure, probably the Senate.
[00:24:16.957 --> 00:24:21.521]  We'll go over all the latest election developments after the break, then into the economy today.
[00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:23.563]  There's huge developments there.
[00:24:23.583 --> 00:24:25.625]  Here's the Christian Science Monitor.
[00:24:26.085 --> 00:24:27.807]  Is hard currency on its way out?
[00:24:27.887 --> 00:24:30.369]  Introducing the new virtual world currency.
[00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.212]  You're not going to get a new global paper currency.
[00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:37.816]  Your currencies will be denominated by the new global digital SDR.
[00:24:38.116 --> 00:24:40.258]  You will face scan and thumbprint globally.
[00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:44.901]  Part of it will go to an international VAT tax and a carbon tax.
[00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:50.004]  It's all been announced in 1975 by the Trilateral Commission.
[00:24:50.325 --> 00:24:51.986]  Exactly how all this would happen.
[00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:55.688]  That's how you can listen to my show from 15 years ago and hear the same thing.
[00:24:56.148 --> 00:24:59.570]  You can watch my films from 13 years ago and hear the exact same thing.
[00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.312]  Or the show from a year ago or a month ago.
[00:25:02.552 --> 00:25:05.694]  But I told you, now is the time they're going to announce this.
[00:25:06.581 --> 00:25:07.963]  Did I pull a rabbit out of a hat?
[00:25:08.083 --> 00:25:09.845]  I'm not an incredible person.
[00:25:10.506 --> 00:25:11.567]  I didn't have a crystal ball.
[00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.611]  I read their own documents.
[00:25:15.392 --> 00:25:18.496]  And I've seen them do everything they say they're going to do, or at least try it.
[00:25:18.756 --> 00:25:19.717]  So we're going to be covering that.
[00:25:19.797 --> 00:25:23.822]  But about an hour and a half ago, the fear-mongering began.
[00:25:25.563 --> 00:25:26.344]  I get ready at home.
[00:25:26.384 --> 00:25:39.452]  I was driving into the office and was listening to MSNBC on XM, Sirius, and they were going, oh my gosh, there could be multiple bombs out of the Middle East on multiple aircraft.
[00:25:39.472 --> 00:25:44.235]  There are two aircraft, one in Newark, New Jersey, and another in Philadelphia.
[00:25:45.256 --> 00:25:47.657]  And oh my gosh, the government's saving us.
[00:25:47.737 --> 00:25:51.720]  And there's another courthouse up in Maine where there might be a bomb.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.642]  And there's a UPS truck in Queens, New York.
[00:25:56.155 --> 00:25:57.376]  The FBI's on it.
[00:25:58.177 --> 00:25:59.378]  Could it be a big attack?
[00:25:59.818 --> 00:26:00.779]  Oh my gosh!
[00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:01.500]  Bombs!
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.040]  Bombs!
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:13.450]  And within 30 minutes driving in, they had shifted it and said, well, this is an over-response out of caution, but it's a good thing to do this.
[00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.712]  And now we know it was England
[00:26:16.952 --> 00:26:24.935]  And there was a shipment out of Yemen of a printer cartridge, and the printer cartridge looked very suspicious.
[00:26:25.695 --> 00:26:32.017]  And so basically any shipments now out of that airport, we are going to have to search them.
[00:26:32.397 --> 00:26:38.079]  And the terrorists, you know, we've got the naked body scanners to keep you safe from Muttalib and the underwear bomber.
[00:26:38.099 --> 00:26:39.099]  They actually said that.
[00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:41.580]  But we've got to put more security on the packages.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.962]  We've got to do something about private aviation.
[00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:48.546]  People are able to just go get on their own planes and, oh my gosh, what are we going to do?
[00:26:48.906 --> 00:26:53.450]  It's going into the holiday season and Al Qaeda loves to ruin our holidays.
[00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:58.074]  They love to do this and on and on and on.
[00:26:58.194 --> 00:27:03.499]  So, two UPS planes isolated at Philly and in Newark.
[00:27:04.099 --> 00:27:09.223]  And it goes on to say that they are trying to keep us safe and they've isolated the planes and they're going over them.
[00:27:09.524 --> 00:27:11.065]  Cargo planes grounded in U.S.
[00:27:11.085 --> 00:27:12.226]  security scare.
[00:27:13.046 --> 00:27:25.196]  And police surround UPS planes and they're looking at UPS trucks in New York State and in Queens and just in Long Island and just everywhere.
[00:27:25.236 --> 00:27:26.317]  It's so scary.
[00:27:26.357 --> 00:27:31.622]  And as this unfolds, we'll continue to tell you everything that's going on.
[00:27:31.722 --> 00:27:32.542]  Oh my gosh.
[00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:48.695]  And every day I hear news reports, even in Texas, where it always starts around deer season, somebody's putting their deer rifle in their car, or somebody sees somebody with a deer rifle in their gun rack, and it's totally legal, but they call the police and, WE SAW A MAN WITH A RIFLE!
[00:27:49.015 --> 00:27:50.796]  WE SAW A MAN GETTING IN HIS CAR!
[00:27:50.816 --> 00:27:52.157]  I heard that yesterday on local news.
[00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:53.578]  IT'S SO SCARY!
[00:27:53.778 --> 00:27:54.698]  WE'VE GOT AN ALERT!
[00:27:54.718 --> 00:27:55.919]  THE POLICE ARE ON THE GROUND!
[00:27:55.939 --> 00:27:58.200]  THEY MAY LOCK DOWN AREAS OF COLLEGE STATION!
[00:27:58.581 --> 00:28:00.482]  SOMEBODY WAS SEEN WITH A RIFLE!
[00:28:00.502 --> 00:28:02.023]  OH MY GOODNESS!
[00:28:03.967 --> 00:28:07.888]  It's this culture of total and complete hysteria.
[00:28:08.508 --> 00:28:25.533]  But then, the flu vaccine last year conservatively maimed and brain-damaged tens of thousands in the U.S., admittedly caused deaths in the U.S., Europe, Australia, mainstream news, people died, and it's like, oh, well, that's just a side effect sometimes.
[00:28:25.613 --> 00:28:29.554]  It's worth it overall to protect you from the flu that's so deadly.
[00:28:30.034 --> 00:28:35.597]  And then they admit, oh, by the way, the H1N1 shot was filled with all sorts of things that cause serious health problems.
[00:28:35.697 --> 00:28:47.343]  Oh, and then meanwhile, remember two years ago, it finally hit the news that FedEx and others were shipping weaponized flu and other things to thousands of labs?
[00:28:48.384 --> 00:28:49.905]  5,000 plus labs in the U.S.
[00:28:49.945 --> 00:28:57.689]  had a super weaponized flu, and we found out about it when a truck, a FedEx truck crashed, and this stuff was all over the highway.
[00:28:58.655 --> 00:29:18.497]  Oh, remember early last year, it was in BBC, it was in Le Figaro, it was in Der Spiegel, it first broke in the Czech Republic, 14 labs had super weaponized flu sent to them, and one technician happened to test it on ferrets and it killed them.
[00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:23.571]  And Baxter Pharmaceuticals said it was all just an accident.
[00:29:23.591 --> 00:29:32.418]  But then we have the headline where in Poland and other countries, large portions of the homeless population died when they were given another experimental flu shot.
[00:29:32.438 --> 00:29:34.579]  You can just type homeless die after flu shot.
[00:29:34.959 --> 00:29:35.920]  But that's OK.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.701]  That's no big deal.
[00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:40.103]  But a package, it could be a bomb.
[00:29:40.143 --> 00:29:41.264]  Bombs are so scary.
[00:29:42.905 --> 00:29:48.869]  We're going to get into the election, the economy, and a lot more straight ahead.
[00:29:50.185 --> 00:29:53.167]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.187 --> 00:29:56.910]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:05.757]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:06.978 --> 00:30:11.742]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:12.123 --> 00:30:18.788]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:20.851 --> 00:30:27.290]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:30:38.998 --> 00:30:40.879]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.641]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:42.921 --> 00:30:45.482]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:45.803 --> 00:30:49.865]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:30:50.045 --> 00:30:52.067]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:56.569]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:57.170]  Got it.
[00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.371]  Others don't.
[00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:03.774]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.094 --> 00:31:04.695]  Number one.
[00:31:04.995 --> 00:31:08.157]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.438 --> 00:31:08.998]  Number two.
[00:31:09.298 --> 00:31:13.842]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.182 --> 00:31:14.622]  It's true.
[00:31:14.922 --> 00:31:19.486]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.806 --> 00:31:20.346]  Number three.
[00:31:20.627 --> 00:31:23.909]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.209 --> 00:31:27.912]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.112 --> 00:31:28.652]  Number 4.
[00:31:28.912 --> 00:31:31.273]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.673 --> 00:31:35.055]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.335 --> 00:31:35.875]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.135 --> 00:31:40.057]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.277 --> 00:31:45.039]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:32:51.693 --> 00:32:52.053]  Thank you!
[00:33:02.337 --> 00:33:09.914]  To the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:14.787 --> 00:33:26.456]  Briefly finishing up with all of this hype terror where they get everyone hyperventilating over a backpack at a federal building or over somebody putting their gun in the back of their car.
[00:33:27.496 --> 00:33:28.817]  This is all dog training.
[00:33:29.058 --> 00:33:34.822]  We're all being conditioned to accept our comfort zones being entered into having our rights violated.
[00:33:36.297 --> 00:33:38.298]  And in every case, they do it for the drug war.
[00:33:38.618 --> 00:33:42.219]  And it's on record that the government ships in the majority of the drugs.
[00:33:42.239 --> 00:33:43.640]  They've been caught over and over again.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.160]  They create the crisis.
[00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:47.901]  They make the drugs illegal, jacking up the price.
[00:33:48.262 --> 00:33:50.162]  They offer the solution, total police state.
[00:33:50.662 --> 00:33:53.023]  They provocateur or stage the terror attacks.
[00:33:53.424 --> 00:33:57.185]  They offer the solution, total end of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:33:58.866 --> 00:34:00.786]  And here's a story out of ABC News.
[00:34:01.146 --> 00:34:02.187]  They're nudging you.
[00:34:02.827 --> 00:34:04.768]  Oh, you won't go through the naked body scanners.
[00:34:06.138 --> 00:34:11.283]  Well, they'll just force women to do it, because on average, women are more compliant.
[00:34:11.323 --> 00:34:17.028]  And I watched that in California, Tuesday morning, taking off from San Jose.
[00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:25.116]  I sat there for 15 minutes after I went to the checkpoint, watching the naked body scanners, and they were only putting women and children through.
[00:34:26.056 --> 00:34:26.977]  And women with children.
[00:34:27.458 --> 00:34:27.818]  No men.
[00:34:27.838 --> 00:34:28.479]  No men.
[00:34:32.523 --> 00:34:37.326]  They'll also just randomly say, today, at the ferry, we're searching all black cars.
[00:34:38.147 --> 00:34:39.147]  Or all red cars.
[00:34:39.688 --> 00:34:41.509]  Or today, we're searching all men.
[00:34:42.049 --> 00:34:43.710]  Or we're searching all RVs.
[00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.491]  So that may have been it, too.
[00:34:45.551 --> 00:34:50.134]  But there they were, naked body scanning, pounding them with radiation, recording their naked bodies.
[00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:51.835]  The government's now been caught lying about that.
[00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:52.836]  They admit they record them.
[00:34:53.176 --> 00:34:53.937]  Mobile trucks.
[00:34:54.537 --> 00:35:04.063]  State courthouses, federal courthouses, they are putting up the mobile trucks, looking through your walls, with incredibly high-powered radiation, dwarfing even the naked body scanners.
[00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:15.670]  And the head of the TSA, what, three months ago, told the Chicago Tribune, he said, in the future, in the next few years, it will be mandatory, you won't be able to opt out for a pat-down.
[00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.253]  And now they have secondary checks at the gate, after you've already gone through.
[00:35:23.797 --> 00:35:25.357]  And I've witnessed it.
[00:35:25.658 --> 00:35:34.340]  Aaron, who flies a lot doing interviews for the films, has witnessed it, where they make old women and men who cannot stand up, who are paralyzed, get up.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:41.122]  And they make other passengers, if they're by themselves, stand them up.
[00:35:41.782 --> 00:35:43.463]  And an old woman's crying, I can't!
[00:35:43.963 --> 00:35:49.044]  I mean, these are people with serious health problems, going to get cancer therapy, going to visit their family one more time.
[00:35:51.363 --> 00:35:54.204]  Groups, one time in San Francisco, flying out to Hawaii.
[00:35:54.304 --> 00:35:59.865]  I wasn't flying to Hawaii, I was flying out of San Francisco back to Texas, but they were going to Hawaii.
[00:36:00.165 --> 00:36:11.388]  And it was a group of World War II vets, this was about six years ago, who were, because I talked to them, and they all had their hats on and their vest on, they were Pearl Harbor battle survivors.
[00:36:12.705 --> 00:36:30.663]  And you've seen an old man who looks like he's about to die, where the eyes start sagging, where they droop down, you can see the red of the inside of the eyelids, and their eyes are seeping, and they've got, you know, crusty stuff all over their skin, and they're on a walker just battling to go with their buddies back one more time.
[00:36:31.824 --> 00:36:48.269]  And they had weird secondary checks then, with some type of security firm, a memory service, it was called Wolverine Security, and it was kind of bright blue, fatigues, and it was foreigners who could barely speak English, whatever the security group this was, it was mainly Asian men, and they were literally going, HALLELUJAH!
[00:36:48.669 --> 00:36:49.489]  And, and, get up!
[00:36:50.009 --> 00:36:56.051]  And, and, you know, these old guys are getting up, and they're, one of them has an oxygen tank, and they're all, what is that?
[00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:56.771]  What are you doing?
[00:36:56.791 --> 00:37:00.132]  And the guy's like, he can't even really understand them.
[00:37:02.029 --> 00:37:08.762]  And this has been written about all over the news, the strip searching women to make them take their shirts off, making women drink their own breast milk.
[00:37:09.023 --> 00:37:10.065]  Like, what's in that bottle?
[00:37:10.386 --> 00:37:11.548]  Well, it's baby breast milk.
[00:37:11.608 --> 00:37:12.269]  I just pumped it.
[00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.451]  Well, drink it!
[00:37:16.209 --> 00:37:19.531]  And then TSA workers flipping out repeatedly and saying, I'm God!
[00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:20.232]  I'm God!
[00:37:20.472 --> 00:37:20.972]  Don't believe me?
[00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:24.234]  Guys, just search the term, TSA worker says he's God.
[00:37:24.254 --> 00:37:28.937]  And they just go crazy on the power trip and start announcing, I'm God!
[00:37:29.317 --> 00:37:29.758]  I'm God!
[00:37:29.798 --> 00:37:32.439]  And started stripping off naked, running around.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.581]  I mean, these are the type of lunatics.
[00:37:36.262 --> 00:37:39.664]  They have this police officer in Austin named Katana.
[00:37:41.385 --> 00:37:42.165]  That's his last name.
[00:37:42.185 --> 00:37:44.267]  In fact, I had the article yesterday and never got to it.
[00:37:45.607 --> 00:38:01.094]  And Katana turned off the squad car video, shot a youth in a car, he got sued over it, the city's defending the suit, then he got a DWI, and they still kept him hired.
[00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:04.436]  They still kept him on.
[00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:07.297]  And now he got fired
[00:38:09.793 --> 00:38:15.523]  Because another police officer who's a female says that he came and invaded her house.
[00:38:17.108 --> 00:38:17.748]  Here's the article.
[00:38:17.788 --> 00:38:19.849]  Police chief fires Quintana.
[00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:25.371]  Domestic incident involving another officer leads to firing less than a week after Quintana was reinstated.
[00:38:25.791 --> 00:38:38.536]  Six days after Austin police officer Leonardo Quintana was released and reinstated to the force, police chief Art Acevedo fired him Wednesday for a second time this year, saying Quintana trespassed in the home of another officer and assaulted her.
[00:38:39.076 --> 00:38:44.958]  The seven-page disciplinary memo said the officer, with whom Quintana had been romantically linked, hit her on the
[00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:51.252]  Hit her head on the wall in the incident, breaking the drywall and requiring her to seek medical treatment.
[00:38:52.112 --> 00:39:04.755]  The officer, Lori Norgella, said she is identified in the memo only as Officer A. Also told Internal Affairs, investigators at Quintana pinned her against the door to take a ring from her.
[00:39:05.455 --> 00:39:07.596]  On multiple occasions he reportedly assaulted her.
[00:39:08.196 --> 00:39:10.917]  I mean, you know, these people are unstable.
[00:39:11.257 --> 00:39:14.198]  If a cop gets a DWI, FIRED!
[00:39:14.578 --> 00:39:15.798]  You're at a higher standard.
[00:39:17.475 --> 00:39:22.220]  If a cop turns his squad car video off and there's a suspicious shooting, gone!
[00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:29.787]  But they keep the bad guys in there until their exploits get more and more insane, more and more crazy.
[00:39:29.807 --> 00:39:33.791]  In fact, you guys actually found the NBC article about the guy saying he was God.
[00:39:34.512 --> 00:39:36.033]  Put that back up on screen for me, thank you.
[00:39:37.154 --> 00:39:41.478]  TSA agent arrested at LAX and it goes on to say,
[00:39:42.745 --> 00:39:47.368]  He was behaving erratically and saying, I'm God, I'm in charge, I'm God.
[00:39:48.228 --> 00:39:52.231]  And I guess it was another one he started saying something similar and running around stripping naked.
[00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:53.011]  That was a different one.
[00:39:53.972 --> 00:40:04.238]  And then how many times do they get a good looking woman cornered and they're doing a pat down of her and they say, listen, I'm going to say you got drugs or bombs unless you give me your phone number and become my sex slave.
[00:40:04.978 --> 00:40:06.239]  At least they get in trouble for that.
[00:40:06.959 --> 00:40:23.627]  Or, other TSA workers have to go through the scanners every day, because they like to abuse the abusers, and they keep making fun of the guy's genitals day after day, so he punches his supervisor in the nose, and the government says, he's arrested, it doesn't matter, we're allowed to make fun of your genitals.
[00:40:24.207 --> 00:40:33.630]  Remember almost a year ago in England, we reported how TV stars over there repeatedly, the women will print off their genitals and ask them to sign it?
[00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:34.950]  That was confirmed?
[00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:40.112]  And our government, the British government said, this is ridiculous, there's no way to even save these or print them.
[00:40:40.592 --> 00:40:51.715]  Turns out in the manuals, they look at your genitals to tune the machine, they look at the genitals for details to see if the machine's tuned to look for weapons.
[00:40:52.115 --> 00:40:53.696]  So in the training they look at your genitals.
[00:40:54.841 --> 00:40:59.044]  Because that's an area that has different folds and a shape that they can clearly tell if it's focused.
[00:40:59.264 --> 00:41:05.308]  Kind of like if you're a videographer, you focus in on the cracks on somebody's eyes, their crow's feet.
[00:41:05.608 --> 00:41:11.132]  Or you focus in on their pupil, and then make sure you can see the different colors in their eye.
[00:41:11.452 --> 00:41:14.394]  That's how you know you've got a true focus before you back the camera out.
[00:41:14.594 --> 00:41:25.559]  Well, they look at your genitals, and they record it, and TSA now admits they record it, and at one courthouse in Florida, they saved over 40,000 images in a few months alone.
[00:41:26.279 --> 00:41:27.279]  Of your children.
[00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:30.801]  Now, there was a lawsuit in Denver at the state courthouse over this.
[00:41:31.949 --> 00:41:37.255]  And they brought in the state and federal law that people under 18, it is child porn.
[00:41:37.535 --> 00:41:40.838]  And so now at that one facility, they don't scan under 18.
[00:41:40.919 --> 00:41:44.102]  All right, I've got to get into the election news and the economy.
[00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:47.566]  I'm just illustrating all of this right now, how it all ties together.
[00:41:47.986 --> 00:41:50.629]  And here's ABC News today.
[00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:52.010]  This is today.
[00:41:52.816 --> 00:41:57.359]  Got links to it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:41:57.459 --> 00:41:59.560]  Pat-downs or full body scans.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.602]  Security gets more personal in airports.
[00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:15.050]  And they're going to do enhanced physical searches, and they already do these sometimes during high security alerts, and I've seen it on the news, where they actually put their hands on a woman's breast and squeeze in a circle.
[00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.431]  And women describe it as very painful.
[00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:20.694]  They put their hand between your legs and squeeze your genitals.
[00:42:21.394 --> 00:42:22.315]  Because there might be a bomb.
[00:42:23.056 --> 00:42:28.624]  Now they're talking about chest x-rays, because al-Qaeda may put fake breast implant bombs in.
[00:42:29.045 --> 00:42:31.328]  That's AP and Reuters and ABC News.
[00:42:32.189 --> 00:42:33.031]  In fact, don't believe me?
[00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:33.471]  Just search...
[00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.989]  Authorities worried about breast bombs.
[00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:39.871]  Breast implant bombs.
[00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:41.232]  And in the articles they say that.
[00:42:41.733 --> 00:42:45.317]  So see, we gotta look for your house with high-powered radiation.
[00:42:45.637 --> 00:42:46.458]  We gotta do this to you.
[00:42:46.498 --> 00:42:54.147]  We gotta not give any radiation protection to the TSA workers who just all day are standing around right there at the machines.
[00:42:54.387 --> 00:42:56.169]  They're just blasting radiation everywhere.
[00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:57.491]  And you know what?
[00:42:57.731 --> 00:43:01.093]  They now call in the TSA and say, do you have a problem with the body scanners?
[00:43:01.113 --> 00:43:02.194]  Are you worried about radiation?
[00:43:02.494 --> 00:43:05.576]  And if you say, yeah, I'm worried, they say, thanks a lot, officer.
[00:43:07.577 --> 00:43:09.038]  And then a week later, you get your pink slip.
[00:43:09.478 --> 00:43:12.120]  They can find idiots that'll sit there roasting themselves.
[00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:14.842]  There it is, Fox News.
[00:43:15.202 --> 00:43:21.005]  Terrorists could use explosives in breast implants to crash planes, experts warn.
[00:43:21.386 --> 00:43:23.167]  And they say they need full-body x-rays.
[00:43:25.091 --> 00:43:26.292]  Oh, and you know, it doesn't matter.
[00:43:26.512 --> 00:43:29.435]  There won't be any lead walls for those running, there won't be any lead walls for you.
[00:43:29.455 --> 00:43:31.276]  It's just, it's over!
[00:43:31.897 --> 00:43:36.941]  They're testing and practicing absurdity on us to break our will and make us accept it.
[00:43:37.142 --> 00:43:38.783]  I mean, what more will we put up with?
[00:43:39.043 --> 00:43:44.268]  I'm in America, watching small children being taken out of strollers and x-rayed.
[00:43:47.771 --> 00:43:49.933]  Three days ago, I'm having to watch this.
[00:43:52.361 --> 00:43:59.223]  And I was hoping they'd pull me out for it because I was going to just sit there and say, so you're radiating yourself right now.
[00:44:00.024 --> 00:44:06.086]  I've got to walk through this high radiation area and spend 10 minutes at a checkpoint being radiated just by the backscatter.
[00:44:07.188 --> 00:44:15.990]  And you don't care about yourself, and I know full well you were called aside, all of you, and asked if you had a problem with it, and those that were smart, you notice some of your co-workers aren't here now.
[00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:26.412]  You're killing yourselves, and if they're arresting me for causing a disturbance, well then I'd be in the news, and I'd beat it in court, saying you tried to stick me in a radiation chamber.
[00:44:26.632 --> 00:44:27.772]  I'm here warning people!
[00:44:28.233 --> 00:44:34.634]  How is the TSA exempt from federal radiological laws that every nurse and doctor are under?
[00:44:37.369 --> 00:44:43.112]  How do our troops use DU weapons when the Army's own manuals say it's going to kill them, soft kill, deader than a hammer later?
[00:44:44.132 --> 00:44:45.233]  But how are they going to handle this?
[00:44:46.794 --> 00:44:54.578]  Months ago, in the Chicago Tribune, the head of the TSA said we will, in the next few years, it will be mandatory, there will be no opt-out secondary search.
[00:44:58.021 --> 00:45:06.843]  Then, we had a caller, and 99% of the time, if a caller's telling the truth, which they almost always are, you can search whatever they're saying and find it, it's already open source.
[00:45:07.123 --> 00:45:08.383]  There's so much media out there.
[00:45:08.923 --> 00:45:10.364]  Nothing gets missed.
[00:45:11.164 --> 00:45:17.285]  That's where the real intelligence gathering is going on for the private individuals who are fighting the globalists and the globalists themselves.
[00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:21.386]  And the caller was a pilot, and he called in and said they're forcing everyone
[00:45:22.728 --> 00:45:37.222]  At this particular Texas airport, it was El Paso, to go through it, and I searched El Paso Times, everyone being body scanned, voila, there it was, already going on three months ago.
[00:45:39.702 --> 00:45:45.886]  If you try to refuse, they get you in there, and they wand you, and they squeeze your legs, and they violate your privacy.
[00:45:46.066 --> 00:45:48.607]  They got federal grants for cops to take blood at checkpoints.
[00:45:48.788 --> 00:45:50.208]  It's all about them getting in your body.
[00:45:50.449 --> 00:45:55.512]  Bill Clinton's got an executive order on record they never implemented to take urine and blood to get a driver's license.
[00:45:55.852 --> 00:45:57.733]  Now it's being proposed in New York.
[00:45:58.073 --> 00:45:59.674]  It's being proposed in other states.
[00:45:59.894 --> 00:46:05.518]  They're now trying to take blood, or they're saying we'll waive your fees if you opt in to give us blood.
[00:46:07.222 --> 00:46:09.422]  See, I mean, we know what the plan is.
[00:46:09.823 --> 00:46:20.265]  So, they're gonna harass you and squeeze your genitals, and here it is, ABC News, and get their hands on you if they can't get that naked body scan of your body.
[00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:21.585]  For their records.
[00:46:22.205 --> 00:46:24.726]  If they can't bathe you in the radiation chamber.
[00:46:25.586 --> 00:46:27.306]  Pat-downs or full body scans.
[00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:29.027]  Security gets more personal at airports.
[00:46:29.647 --> 00:46:33.968]  As TSA changes airport pat-down procedure, some ask if security's gone too far.
[00:46:34.977 --> 00:46:38.119]  And then it goes on to say they are increasing the pat-downs.
[00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:42.542]  It's more of an enhanced pat-down.
[00:46:42.602 --> 00:46:48.146]  And you can see it on the news, where they literally grab a woman's breast and then just squeeze around the edges.
[00:46:48.266 --> 00:46:49.627]  Let me make sure these are real.
[00:46:50.288 --> 00:46:58.174]  And there's a husband right there, or there's a father or a mother watching their 14-year-old daughter, and there's that TSA worker just, oh yeah!
[00:46:58.894 --> 00:47:00.074]  Doesn't get any better than this.
[00:47:00.114 --> 00:47:00.595]  They love it.
[00:47:01.215 --> 00:47:05.376]  Next time you pass through security in some airports around the country, you may face a difficult dilemma.
[00:47:05.776 --> 00:47:11.057]  Would you rather have a revealing full-body scan or what some are calling x-rated pat-down?
[00:47:12.118 --> 00:47:19.540]  Some passengers opt out of the full-body scan concerned about the low dose of radiation emitted by the high-tech body scanners that are being put in place at many terminals.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.801]  And what about them saving the image of your naked body?
[00:47:22.541 --> 00:47:23.141]  The machines
[00:47:24.528 --> 00:47:29.734]  Also are able to see beneath clothes, creating a photorealistic picture of the passenger's body.
[00:47:30.114 --> 00:47:35.660]  But for those who refuse the scan, the alternative pat-down is about to get equally thorough.
[00:47:36.861 --> 00:47:37.882]  And there's a video clip.
[00:47:37.963 --> 00:47:40.465]  Watch World News Tonight with Dan Sawyer for more on the story.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.042]  Starting Friday, the TSA is changing its pat-down procedure.
[00:47:44.222 --> 00:47:46.524]  So they want to force you to do the naked body scan.
[00:47:47.004 --> 00:47:54.730]  TSA officers used a pat-down procedure with the backs of their hands, but now they'll use the fronts of their hands to search more than ever before.
[00:47:55.714 --> 00:48:06.777]  And see, this was all about training the TSA people, too, to get the backs of their hands down a woman's inside of her thighs, and you kind of see them going, ooh, and then up over their hind end, and then up over their sides.
[00:48:06.797 --> 00:48:08.738]  I mean, it's a feel-down, you know, kind of like it's your wife.
[00:48:08.818 --> 00:48:09.318]  Oh, baby.
[00:48:09.338 --> 00:48:13.359]  You know, you go up her thighs, up her waist, up under her arms.
[00:48:14.019 --> 00:48:15.039]  It's a romantic thing.
[00:48:15.099 --> 00:48:15.600]  Not anymore.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:21.381]  It's men and women doing this to you, and it's about training the TSA.
[00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:23.482]  Well, now the hands are going like this.
[00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:31.689]  And now they're going on your breasts and on your genitals and they squeeze them to make sure it's not an Al Qaeda booby trap.
[00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:34.212]  Oh boy.
[00:48:36.274 --> 00:48:37.015]  Now listen to this.
[00:48:37.495 --> 00:48:41.159]  They will put their hands on body parts that were once off limits.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:41.460]  See?
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.002]  Well, it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:48:44.932 --> 00:48:47.153]  Starting Friday, the TSA is changing its pat-down procedures.
[00:48:47.193 --> 00:48:53.497]  TSA officers used to pat down passengers with the backs of their hands, but now they'll use the fronts of their hands to search more than ever before.
[00:48:54.038 --> 00:48:57.440]  In some cases, touching body parts that were once off-limits.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.461]  Genitals and breast.
[00:49:00.022 --> 00:49:01.162]  Genitals and breast.
[00:49:01.362 --> 00:49:06.165]  They are going to put their hands on your private parts.
[00:49:06.506 --> 00:49:07.847]  They're going to squeeze them.
[00:49:08.207 --> 00:49:09.287]  They're going to touch them.
[00:49:09.708 --> 00:49:11.529]  They're going to enjoy themselves.
[00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:15.630]  And that's why they've had so many TSA workers busted raping children.
[00:49:18.451 --> 00:49:22.652]  So, this is the way they humiliate you.
[00:49:23.132 --> 00:49:24.313]  This is how they teach you.
[00:49:24.353 --> 00:49:25.373]  This is how they train you.
[00:49:25.613 --> 00:49:32.715]  And all the cases of where women have piercings, and they take them behind closed doors and go, here's a pair of pliers, remove that piercing.
[00:49:34.465 --> 00:49:36.326]  They can see full well it's metal.
[00:49:36.766 --> 00:49:40.007]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we're just being trained basically for giant gas chambers.
[00:49:40.267 --> 00:49:41.588]  I mean, that's what this is.
[00:49:41.628 --> 00:49:45.870]  They're training you to take your urine, take your blood at checkpoints to get DMV.
[00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:57.875]  They're openly announcing they're going to have giant checkpoints on the news that body scan you to go to a football game, to go to a theater event, to go hear the opera, everything.
[00:49:58.715 --> 00:50:10.944]  This is everyone being inculcated, worse than Nazi Germany, and the government is staging the terror attacks, and even if you don't believe that fact, they are using it on you in their own internal documents.
[00:50:11.024 --> 00:50:12.826]  You are the target.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.942]  And it goes on to describe pilots are refusing to have their genitals grabbed.
[00:50:18.203 --> 00:50:18.903]  Women are refusing.
[00:50:19.103 --> 00:50:19.924]  People get angry.
[00:50:20.464 --> 00:50:21.085]  And you know what?
[00:50:21.565 --> 00:50:24.267]  How many people have been beaten to death in the U.S.
[00:50:24.307 --> 00:50:25.108]  and Canada and England?
[00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:26.069]  You hear about it all the time.
[00:50:26.149 --> 00:50:28.751]  Oh, she choked herself on the handcuffs that were behind her back.
[00:50:29.291 --> 00:50:31.393]  Oh, we jumped on this guy's head and broke his neck.
[00:50:31.413 --> 00:50:32.354]  We don't know why he died.
[00:50:32.754 --> 00:50:33.855]  You start talking back.
[00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:35.777]  They pull out a billy club and a taser.

[00:50:57.314 --> 00:50:57.774]  Nothing!
[00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:59.255]  We're gonna squeeze!

[00:52:24.242 --> 00:52:29.786]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.206 --> 00:52:33.909]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:34.389 --> 00:52:38.372]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:38.672 --> 00:52:44.196]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:44.637 --> 00:52:47.579]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.179 --> 00:52:49.600]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:50.581]  It's here.

[00:52:59.467 --> 00:53:07.373]  Why almost all politicians, teachers, and preachers are dead wrong about how to keep this country from becoming a total dictatorship.
[00:53:08.234 --> 00:53:11.457]  If that headline got your attention, then you know the only way back.
[00:53:11.657 --> 00:53:14.399]  The only way back to true freedom and liberty in America.
[00:53:14.639 --> 00:53:18.381]  Have you ever wondered about whether your personal and religious liberty will survive?
[00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:23.325]  After all, what good are gold, silver, and survival supplies in a concentration camp?
[00:53:23.525 --> 00:53:27.547]  And have you ever thought about what kind of America you're leaving to your kids and grandkids?
[00:53:27.908 --> 00:53:32.070]  Then theonlywayback.com is an open online letter you must read.
[00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:36.493]  Find out where true liberty comes from and discover the foundations of freedom
[00:53:36.533 --> 00:53:37.373]  This is not America.
[00:54:05.629 --> 00:54:06.629]  This is not freedom.
[00:54:06.649 --> 00:54:08.230]  This is not security.
[00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:15.073]  This is the baptism of tyranny, the baptism of oppression, the baptism of the end of dignity.
[00:54:17.094 --> 00:54:18.294]  Little piece of me.
[00:54:18.475 --> 00:54:22.516]  We die for the system.
[00:54:33.578 --> 00:54:37.180]  We're going to be talking about the economy, the election, all that's happening.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.302]  In fact, I'm going to get into it right now with Bob Chapman coming up.
[00:54:42.723 --> 00:54:50.548]  Then we have the head of one of the biggest unions and involved with the government, the Parliament, the Prime Minister, decrying him in Australia, going public for 9-11 truth.
[00:54:50.888 --> 00:55:00.013]  He's joining us from Australia during the last hour to get into people standing up and having courage because 9-11 is being used to enslave all of us, regardless of what you really think happened with it.
[00:55:01.283 --> 00:55:05.746]  Shouldn't the head of Al-Qaeda dining at the Pentagon two months after 9-11 be an issue?
[00:55:06.147 --> 00:55:09.569]  Or are we supposed to just forget that and send our kids to the naked body scanners?
[00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:14.213]  By the way, Rob Dews shot video at the airport a few months ago that we've never shown.
[00:55:14.253 --> 00:55:15.854]  He just reminded me of it.
[00:55:16.614 --> 00:55:23.900]  Of people being sent through naked body scanners and then having the enhanced pat-down done.
[00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.602]  So, oh, you don't want to go through a body scanner?
[00:55:27.182 --> 00:55:27.603]  We're just gonna
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:29.761]  We're just going to humiliate you.
[00:55:29.781 --> 00:55:31.022]  We're going to touch your private parts.
[00:55:32.123 --> 00:55:33.864]  This has nothing to do with fighting terror.
[00:55:33.904 --> 00:55:36.406]  Okay, I'm done talking about that for now.
[00:55:36.486 --> 00:55:37.607]  Later we'll have that video.
[00:55:39.888 --> 00:55:46.313]  And they always have these little staged fear-mongering events to remind us of, you know, how important the whole police state is to all of us.
[00:55:46.373 --> 00:55:52.558]  Now, I'm going to go through the numbers and what's happening in the states, but I've been really studying it in depth.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:02.646]  of the last few weeks and Sharon Angle is pulling away with about a five point lead in most of the polls.
[00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:07.129]  What I do is go through an index of polls in Nevada against Harry Reid.
[00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:13.895]  Rand Paul had lost some of his lead on average about nine points down to about five.
[00:56:14.195 --> 00:56:19.939]  Now he's surged back to nine points ahead in some polls, ten, eleven, twelve points in others in scientific polls.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:36.071]  But that doesn't mean they're going to win, because even Sharon Engel's lawyer has said clearly Harry Reid is trying to steal this election, and in the biggest county in Nevada, there have been thousands of reports of not being able to vote for Sharon Engel for Senate.
[00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:39.213]  You can only vote for Harry Reid, and they're calling that a glitch.
[00:56:39.673 --> 00:56:48.239]  It's not a glitch that most of the troops didn't get their ballots, or that the ballots they did get have been lost, being shipped back to the United States from all the countries they're in.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:54.843]  Different election officials have been indicted in Florida and several other states the last week, caught red-handed.
[00:56:54.863 --> 00:57:02.488]  It's usually people running for higher office who happen to be the election officials who are being caught with their hands directly in the cookie jar.
[00:57:03.308 --> 00:57:05.170]  And that is a serious conflict of interest.
[00:57:07.092 --> 00:57:12.236]  We're going to see more dirty tricks, but it is now starting to get picked up by more newspapers and TV in Kentucky.
[00:57:12.656 --> 00:57:23.084]  The Jack Conway cover-up, he and his prosecutor brother getting tipped off about a narcotics raid, and then his brother and others lying about it once they got caught, and the detectives lying about it.
[00:57:23.424 --> 00:57:26.667]  They've been caught red-handed in what is clear obstruction of justice.
[00:57:27.307 --> 00:57:28.708]  That's really stinging him hard.
[00:57:29.229 --> 00:57:32.591]  So good job for everybody getting that information out.
[00:57:33.976 --> 00:57:37.038]  I'm really worried about Rand Paul because he's more than just a man.
[00:57:37.358 --> 00:57:41.862]  He's more than just a senatorial candidate who it looks like is going to win three days from now.
[00:57:42.462 --> 00:57:43.383]  It's just three full days.
[00:57:43.483 --> 00:57:47.525]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[00:57:47.546 --> 00:57:50.768]  So it's about three and a half days until Tuesday and the election.
[00:57:51.288 --> 00:57:56.412]  And it looks like a complete wave of Republican victories, if I had to guess.
[00:57:57.878 --> 00:58:05.063]  The Republicans will get 50 seats in the House of Representatives and 9 seats to 10 seats.
[00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:06.465]  If they get 10, they take the Senate back.
[00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:09.912]  In the U.S.
[00:58:09.952 --> 00:58:12.673]  Senate, but there is election fraud.
[00:58:13.153 --> 00:58:19.815]  And the good thing is, this is a much better crop of Republicans than came in in 94, who were neocons, led by Newtie Gingrich.
[00:58:21.435 --> 00:58:30.678]  Boehner and others, though he's an acolyte of Gingrich, know they're all gone in two years if they don't deliver the end of Obamacare, the end of carbon taxes, and the rest of it.
[00:58:31.018 --> 00:58:33.759]  The problem is, they also want the naked body scanners in the police state.
[00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:35.819]  But there are a lot of good candidates in there.
[00:58:35.859 --> 00:58:37.440]  This is a big victory against the globalists.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:38.340]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.445 --> 00:58:43.231]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.132 --> 00:58:54.756]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.136 --> 00:58:58.160]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:03.185]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.205 --> 00:59:09.432]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:09.592 --> 00:59:11.814]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.335 --> 00:59:12.635]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:12.655 --> 00:59:12.895]  Bernanke?
[00:59:12.915 --> 00:59:13.496]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:13.516 --> 00:59:14.597]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:14.937 --> 00:59:17.359]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.249 --> 00:59:33.089]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:38.191]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:59:52.795 --> 00:59:54.735]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:57.936]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.707 --> 01:00:08.892]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.553 --> 01:00:10.353]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.134 --> 01:00:12.035]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:16.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.861 --> 01:00:20.925]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.653 --> 01:00:26.174]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:26.214 --> 01:00:29.276]  It is Friday, the 29th day of October 2010.
[01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.697]  We are now into hour number two.
[01:00:31.717 --> 01:00:35.659]  I want to look at the elections across the country.
[01:00:35.679 --> 01:00:40.362]  A lot of them are very close, and that's where you're seeing the election fraud.
[01:00:40.742 --> 01:00:43.484]  No doubt in Kentucky to try to beat Rand Paul.
[01:00:43.544 --> 01:00:47.906]  No doubt in Nevada with Sharon Engel on average about five points ahead of Harry Reid.
[01:00:48.527 --> 01:00:50.788]  But clear evidence of election fraud there.
[01:00:51.328 --> 01:00:53.410]  Election fraud in New York, Illinois.
[01:00:54.753 --> 01:01:11.196]  Also, I heard Ed Schultz on XM with his TV show yesterday, driving home, literally fear-mongering about how the American people who support the Tea Party are brown-shirted Nazis who are beating people up nationwide.
[01:01:11.936 --> 01:01:13.196]  There have been a few scuffles.
[01:01:13.676 --> 01:01:16.637]  A woman in a wig running up to Rand Paul trying to throw stuff in his car.
[01:01:17.097 --> 01:01:18.717]  One guy puts his foot on her to hold her down.
[01:01:19.417 --> 01:01:23.638]  Meanwhile, we forget that moveon.org person cut a person's finger off.
[01:01:24.358 --> 01:01:27.440]  I mean, there's just countless videos of them beating people up.
[01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:30.482]  The big union thugs beating people up in the last year.
[01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:33.884]  I'd say it's five to one, just from what I've seen.
[01:01:34.605 --> 01:01:40.569]  We've written articles with just hundreds of links to the violence and thugs beating people up and the police doing nothing.
[01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:45.332]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are playing the part of poor victims who've been attacked.
[01:01:45.692 --> 01:01:47.714]  But then we got a new video from We Are Change.
[01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:50.400]  New York, the head chapter.
[01:01:51.121 --> 01:01:53.663]  And we heard about this a few weeks ago when it happened, but they've now released the video.
[01:01:53.683 --> 01:01:56.165]  And the cops did arrest one of Jon Stewart's head writers.
[01:01:56.805 --> 01:01:58.246]  They politely asked him questions.
[01:01:58.286 --> 01:02:03.370]  They went up to him during a book signing in the Barnes & Noble and said, Mr. Stewart, why do you make fun of 9-11 truth?
[01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:05.752]  And he's, you know, why are you with Glenn Beck on that?
[01:02:06.192 --> 01:02:08.134]  And he said, oh, because I think Al-Qaeda did 9-11.
[01:02:08.914 --> 01:02:09.775]  They said, okay, thank you.
[01:02:09.895 --> 01:02:12.837]  Well, they went outside and they were out there handing out literature.
[01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:14.633]  On a city street.
[01:02:15.413 --> 01:02:18.295]  And his guys came out, got in their face, screamed, cussed at him.
[01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:19.836]  We can't play it on air, there's so much cussing.
[01:02:20.197 --> 01:02:22.438]  It'd be unintelligible, there's so many cuss words we'd have to cut out.
[01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:25.220]  You can watch the video, unedited, up there.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:32.685]  And they broke one camera, attacked him, punched a guy in the face, was being very polite to him, saying, please don't spit in my face, please don't scream at me.
[01:02:33.005 --> 01:02:34.186]  And the guy just punches him.
[01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:35.487]  And they did arrest him.
[01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:37.909]  So, that's pretty big news.
[01:02:37.949 --> 01:02:41.191]  While Ed Schultz is running around saying, they're brown shirts, the Nazis are here!
[01:02:42.672 --> 01:02:42.913]  No, no.
[01:02:43.213 --> 01:02:45.055]  The Nazism is the naked body scanners.
[01:02:46.077 --> 01:02:47.719]  But also the big economic news.
[01:02:47.899 --> 01:02:50.602]  As we told you, they're now announcing the global digital currency.
[01:02:51.063 --> 01:02:53.947]  Christian Science Monitor is hard currency on its way out.
[01:02:54.367 --> 01:02:56.510]  Introducing the new virtual world currency.
[01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:58.072]  We're going to talk about all of that.
[01:02:58.092 --> 01:03:00.034]  We're about to go to break, but I wanted to bring Bob Chapman up.
[01:03:00.054 --> 01:03:01.416]  He always joins us once a week.
[01:03:01.596 --> 01:03:03.736]  And he's on with us from the International Forecaster.
[01:03:03.756 --> 01:03:10.818]  In the two minutes we got left for the break, what do you think of this election-time fear-mongering that they're now admitting basically was nothing?
[01:03:11.378 --> 01:03:15.179]  It was a printer cartridge that scared them, shutting down all these flights and things.
[01:03:15.799 --> 01:03:16.099]  Bob?
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:23.621]  It's just another piece of misdirection to get people all riled up.
[01:03:23.961 --> 01:03:29.442]  I think they better address the fact that the President is even going to be in a country at a major election.
[01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.982]  800 people going with him, what is it, 80 planes I've got?
[01:03:35.042 --> 01:03:36.102]  The whole thing's crazy!
[01:03:38.602 --> 01:03:39.963]  Yeah, tell folks about that trip.
[01:03:41.523 --> 01:03:42.223]  Well, I don't know.
[01:03:42.563 --> 01:03:50.245]  I don't know what they're doing over there, but it looks like to me that they've taken all of their friends on vacation, and you and I get to pay for it.
[01:03:51.085 --> 01:03:52.065]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:55.405]  Remember how Bush was on vacation for a month before 9-11?
[01:03:57.446 --> 01:03:58.446]  Right, that's correct.
[01:03:59.713 --> 01:04:00.774]  That's correct, you're right.
[01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:06.519]  So why is the Emperor going on this out-of-country trip?
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:15.207]  Well, it could be that they've got something planned, but I don't have any proof of it, and so that's a possibility.
[01:04:16.308 --> 01:04:23.775]  But I think you have to understand the source, the players involved, him and his wife, and those that surround him.
[01:04:24.415 --> 01:04:25.997]  I think it's just a fun package.
[01:04:27.233 --> 01:04:28.979]  You know, he's not going to be there in two years.
[01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:33.414]  He may as well have a good time, he figures, and everybody's leaving him.
[01:04:34.312 --> 01:04:35.713]  You know, that's another big issue.
[01:04:36.113 --> 01:04:43.718]  When the Republicans win the House, probably the Senate, will everybody go back to sleep about banker bailouts and police state and all the corruption?
[01:04:44.059 --> 01:04:45.580]  Or will people continue to be angry?
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.801]  I think they will because we're in a depression.
[01:04:48.101 --> 01:04:49.522]  Bob Chapman, let's talk about that.
[01:04:49.922 --> 01:04:55.206]  Let's get into the election, the economy, and then take phone calls and a lot more straight ahead.
[01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:56.887]  It's Friday with Bob Chapman.
[01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:57.948]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.084 --> 01:05:02.505]  Hello from eFoods Direct.

[01:05:47.147 --> 01:05:50.588]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:06:03.388 --> 01:06:04.269]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:04.629 --> 01:06:08.211]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:08.511 --> 01:06:10.773]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:10.793 --> 01:06:16.236]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:16.676 --> 01:06:22.920]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:28.862]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:29.302 --> 01:06:32.983]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:33.483 --> 01:06:37.484]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:37.764 --> 01:06:43.286]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:43.726 --> 01:06:46.667]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:47.267 --> 01:06:48.708]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:49.248 --> 01:06:49.688]  It's here.

[01:06:59.042 --> 01:07:03.005]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:07:03.225 --> 01:07:09.270]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:16.756]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:17.036 --> 01:07:21.580]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:30.385]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:07:30.565 --> 01:07:34.287]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:07:34.813 --> 01:07:40.997]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:41.578 --> 01:07:45.000]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:07:51.845 --> 01:07:52.626]  Thank you.
[01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:08.548]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:09.189 --> 01:08:09.989]  You want answers?
[01:08:10.769 --> 01:08:11.610]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:15.932]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.513 --> 01:08:20.555]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.301 --> 01:08:26.863]  Bob Chapman's with us to cover the election, the economy, and a lot more in this hour.
[01:08:26.903 --> 01:08:33.967]  Then we have a guest joining us from Australia with key 9-11 truth information and the demonization campaign going on over there and worldwide.
[01:08:33.987 --> 01:08:38.509]  I guess anybody that points out the giant trillion ton elephant sitting on top of us.
[01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:41.270]  Bob Chapman, you just joined us.
[01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:42.651]  We were getting into the
[01:08:44.993 --> 01:08:47.677]  I'm really concerned about election fraud.
[01:08:47.697 --> 01:08:59.353]  I mean, it's all over the news that voting machines are going for the Democrats in key Senate and House races, that people aren't allowed to vote for the Republican or the Tea Party or the Libertarian candidates.
[01:09:00.362 --> 01:09:10.027]  Many of the military people never got their ballots, though for two months this has been pointed out, or the ballots that they did get have not been shipped back or have disappeared.
[01:09:10.907 --> 01:09:16.270]  We are really seeing desperate activity here that is going on, and you know, that's the issue.
[01:09:17.011 --> 01:09:20.272]  Bush used these machines for fraud in Ohio and other places and got caught.
[01:09:20.292 --> 01:09:25.055]  Then Republicans were like, oh, there's no problem with the machines, and now the Democrats are using them.
[01:09:25.515 --> 01:09:28.278]  You know, the issue is whoever's in power is going to use these.
[01:09:28.298 --> 01:09:29.219]  We need to get rid of them.
[01:09:29.239 --> 01:09:30.620]  And there's a big move to do that.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.243]  Some counties and states are moving in that right direction.
[01:09:33.823 --> 01:09:47.837]  Bob, breaking down watching this election and the fact they pulled out all the stops against Rand Paul with this woman charging through security trying to throw a sign in his window and the media not showing the start of the video.
[01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:53.862]  The good news is it's actually driven his poll numbers up.
[01:09:54.282 --> 01:10:03.289]  Meanwhile, it's starting to come out in mainstream news, thanks to our listeners getting the word out and others, that Jack Conway was obstructing justice with his brother in a narcotics investigation of his brother.
[01:10:03.569 --> 01:10:04.930]  Give us your take on that, Bob Chapman.
[01:10:06.111 --> 01:10:08.753]  Well, I think these are the kind of things that would be expected.
[01:10:09.534 --> 01:10:17.940]  And if you go back in history, you will see, back the last 150 years at least, that in the United States, and many, many other countries,
[01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:23.313]  People have done all sorts of desperate things to get elected because it's like a honeypot.
[01:10:23.633 --> 01:10:24.533]  They steal from it.
[01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:30.298]  And so, you're going to see desperate people do desperate things, and that's what's happening.
[01:10:30.858 --> 01:10:32.960]  The tidal wave is going to be overwhelming.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:39.945]  How much, or how badly, will be affected by cheating through the machines?
[01:10:40.546 --> 01:10:41.086]  I don't know.
[01:10:41.106 --> 01:10:43.187]  I just know it's there.
[01:10:44.468 --> 01:10:46.250]  The only way to solve it is to go back to
[01:10:47.065 --> 01:10:49.707]  You know, doing the way they used to before with paper ballot.
[01:10:50.607 --> 01:10:54.450]  And hopefully all and or most will do that.
[01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:57.572]  And yes, we're going to get somewhat injured.
[01:10:58.212 --> 01:11:01.775]  But I think overall, the people realize that.
[01:11:01.795 --> 01:11:07.778]  And I think what we're seeing, particularly in the House races is, you know, 50 seats.
[01:11:07.818 --> 01:11:08.879]  That's that's enormous.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.142]  And so and I assume that almost all of them are Democrats.
[01:11:14.779 --> 01:11:31.589]  That's some great gains, and I think the American people, the constituency, can get those who are new in Congress to listen before Wall Street and banking pays them off or attempts to do so.
[01:11:32.729 --> 01:11:35.531]  And I think we've got some great chances here.
[01:11:38.786 --> 01:11:51.572]  The numbers I've got from the sources that have been accurate in the past is 50 House seats in the House, the Republicans take it with a nice majority, and 9 to 10 Senate seats.
[01:11:51.652 --> 01:11:56.294]  That's what all the polls show, unless there's election fraud, and we know that's going on.
[01:11:56.975 --> 01:11:59.116]  What's your breakdown on that, Bob?
[01:12:00.757 --> 01:12:01.937]  It's just too hard to say.
[01:12:02.577 --> 01:12:04.939]  I mean, I just can't.
[01:12:05.019 --> 01:12:05.519]  I don't know.
[01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:12.817]  I know they're going to try to do what they're going to try to do, but I don't know how effective they will be.
[01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:21.979]  If they've got the packages that the Bush people have, they might be very effective, especially in the close races.
[01:12:23.299 --> 01:12:28.700]  I saw that happen in the election in Mexico five years ago.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.200]  There was no question that it was rigged.
[01:12:33.341 --> 01:12:35.961]  And who was down there doing that?
[01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:37.511]  The Bush people.
[01:12:38.874 --> 01:12:45.004]  And so, do the Democrats have the same kind of abilities that the neocons had?
[01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:45.946]  I don't know.
[01:12:51.414 --> 01:12:53.754]  What do you expect the Republicans to do?
[01:12:53.774 --> 01:13:06.777]  I mean, if you look at the different people that are running, I'd say more than half of them are some of the more patriotic type people, not of a Rand Paul or Ron Paul caliber, but certainly better than the mainline neocon Republicans.
[01:13:07.757 --> 01:13:19.179]  A, how do you see a repeat of 94 with the inside neocons, and we've now got internal memos on this, trying to dominate and suppress the more patriotic arm
[01:13:19.619 --> 01:13:21.319]  Well, first of all, the neocons lost their credibility.
[01:13:21.359 --> 01:13:28.462]  And yes, they're going to be players, but they're not going to be able to run over the good people that are now being elected new.
[01:13:48.348 --> 01:13:49.689]  Uh, into the House and Senate.
[01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:51.710]  I do not think they'll be successful.
[01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:58.735]  It's just like, uh, Gingrich running around and he purportedly is going to run for the President in 2012.
[01:13:59.075 --> 01:14:00.295]  I mean, you gotta be kidding me.
[01:14:01.776 --> 01:14:03.918]  I mean, if he was in a dog show, he couldn't win.
[01:14:04.698 --> 01:14:06.920]  And they've just burned their bridges.
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.941]  Those kinds of people.
[01:14:10.001 --> 01:14:17.246]  Look, you know, there was a lot very bad with the eight years that we spent under, uh, Junior Bush, we'll call him.
[01:14:18.084 --> 01:14:21.066]  And, uh, people don't want to go back to that.
[01:14:21.907 --> 01:14:30.712]  And after these people get elected, the people out there in the streets, they're going to write and they're going to email to the new people in Congress.
[01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:36.076]  They're going to tell them, look, we want you to get rid of this medical plan.
[01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:42.360]  We want you to revisit and make changes in the financial reform.
[01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:44.581]  We do not want a 1% transaction tax.
[01:14:48.057 --> 01:14:54.901]  We do not want a Fed Reserve, nor do we want quantitative easing from them, because they're just making the problem worse.
[01:14:55.802 --> 01:14:58.443]  And on and on, there's many, many things they can tackle.
[01:14:59.004 --> 01:15:13.432]  And these are the things that the current administration is going to, are going to try to pass between the end of the congressional election next week and when the session ends.
[01:15:14.773 --> 01:15:16.154]  And one of them is
[01:15:17.009 --> 01:15:24.991]  An attempt, I think, will happen to pass legislation for the government to commandeer retirement plans.
[01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:30.092]  I don't know whether it's going to be successful, and quite frankly, I don't think it will, but they're going to try.
[01:15:30.452 --> 01:15:31.312]  Well, that's the point.
[01:15:31.352 --> 01:15:43.615]  They're openly announcing through the different presidential commissions and the Democrats in Congress that they do want to, quote, take over the even private pension plans to, quote, protect them, but then slap a tax on them.
[01:15:44.896 --> 01:15:46.316]  Well, a tax is five percent.
[01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:53.671]  It passed the way it stands on every worker, and that money is supposed to go into Social Security.
[01:15:53.731 --> 01:15:58.112]  So, what they're saying, in essence, we ought to increase Social Security taxes by 5%.
[01:15:59.873 --> 01:16:08.755]  You know, and that money will go into the General Fund, when in fact they'll squander it on some union plan or something.
[01:16:09.195 --> 01:16:13.716]  And what's very, very difficult about this
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:25.884]  Snatching of six trillion dollars worth of retirement plans is that there are a lot of corporations that are for it, as well as the labor unions, because they're all underfunded.
[01:16:25.904 --> 01:16:34.346]  I mean, even the S&P 500 companies are about 73% funded, which is not bad, but it's not good either.
[01:16:34.466 --> 01:16:39.688]  So they need to pump up the Ponzi scheme because so many of the companies invested in derivatives.
[01:16:41.008 --> 01:16:41.448]  That's right.
[01:16:41.468 --> 01:16:43.529]  They lost skizzillions of dollars.
[01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:52.992]  And, you know, they were all involved in the CDOs as well, Collateralized Debt Obligations, which are the bonds that hold the mortgages.
[01:16:53.432 --> 01:16:54.332]  They had lots of them.
[01:16:55.252 --> 01:17:03.314]  And they got a lot of real estate that they can't get rid of, that they're buried in, particularly the labor unions, but some of the corporations as well.
[01:17:03.754 --> 01:17:05.535]  But the main thing is it's underfunded.
[01:17:06.375 --> 01:17:08.336]  They had never any intention of funding.
[01:17:08.896 --> 01:17:12.697]  I don't know what the average is for labor unions, but if I would have guessed, I'd say 50% at best.
[01:17:16.144 --> 01:17:18.145]  So that's why they want that kind of legislation.
[01:17:18.525 --> 01:17:23.246]  They want an extra 5% tax pouring into the general fund so they can squander it.
[01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:27.808]  Let me bring up another issue that ties into the election.
[01:17:28.448 --> 01:17:31.289]  But obviously this lame duck is one of the biggest issues we're facing.
[01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:41.592]  Not just repealing stuff, but stopping them from passing even more draconian, globalist, agenda-linked garbage.
[01:17:42.592 --> 01:17:51.878]  Rand Paul has surged ahead of Conway despite the stomp smear and that whole contrived manufactured story.
[01:17:51.918 --> 01:17:53.379]  And the same thing with Sharon Angle.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.982]  Clearly the mainstream media is out of bullets.
[01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:58.863]  The mainstream corporate media is imploding.
[01:17:58.903 --> 01:18:06.088]  Their ratings, their advertising, their trust meters in major polls are the lowest it's ever been according to Gallup and others.
[01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:08.549]  And that's what I told four or five months ago.
[01:18:08.649 --> 01:18:12.032]  I told Politico and Salon and others that quoted me that
[01:18:13.172 --> 01:18:15.813]  If they really wanted to hurt Rand Paul, they would endorse him.
[01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:26.658]  But by attacking him and lying about him and demonizing him, people then go to him in droves.
[01:18:27.785 --> 01:18:32.087]  And I still think they're so hubris filled, they haven't completely figured that out yet.
[01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:35.769]  And that's good, because as soon as they figure it out, you know, then they'll be a harder enemy to beat.
[01:18:36.129 --> 01:18:45.053]  But I mean, Bob, the hubris of them putting out all this cartoonish lies, it's literally the emperor has no clothes, but they don't understand that.
[01:18:46.654 --> 01:18:55.858]  You know, I think they've, for many, many years, believing that the media would be able to control the public.
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.622]  Through propaganda, propagandization.
[01:18:59.762 --> 01:19:02.124]  They figured, you know, most of the job was done for them.
[01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:19.737]  What's happened in the last couple of years, actually before that, probably three to four years back, is that people are forcing themselves to get a grasp on what's going on with their government, not only at the national, but all levels.
[01:19:20.677 --> 01:19:21.878]  And they're disgusted.
[01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.901]  They see that when there is
[01:19:26.986 --> 01:19:30.352]  Quantitative easing plans, in other words, a creation of money and credit.
[01:19:30.753 --> 01:19:31.354]  Where does it go?
[01:19:31.374 --> 01:19:37.846]  It all goes to Wall Street and banking, insurance companies, transnational conglomerates.
[01:19:39.179 --> 01:19:41.900]  None of it comes down to the people, the unemployment.
[01:19:42.241 --> 01:19:43.101]  Bob, we've got to go to break.
[01:19:43.141 --> 01:19:47.463]  Stay there and complete that important thought because I have some things I want to add as well.
[01:19:47.523 --> 01:19:49.184]  But the awakening has happened.
[01:19:49.764 --> 01:19:51.825]  People couldn't believe it was as bad as we said.
[01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:55.107]  Now they're finding out it's that bad and then some.
[01:19:55.427 --> 01:19:58.949]  We'll break that down and where you see this going and we'll get into the economy and your phone calls.

[01:20:58.945 --> 01:21:02.227]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:21:03.027 --> 01:21:07.269]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:13.472]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:21:13.692 --> 01:21:15.833]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:21:16.113 --> 01:21:22.076]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:21:22.216 --> 01:21:25.560]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.322]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:21:27.502 --> 01:21:29.544]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[01:21:45.598 --> 01:21:46.339]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:04.525]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:04.985 --> 01:22:12.771]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:13.111 --> 01:22:20.937]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:21.277 --> 01:22:26.018]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:31.059]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:35.420]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:36.940]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.081]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:45.902]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:46.402 --> 01:22:48.923]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:49.403 --> 01:22:51.985]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.306 --> 01:22:55.067]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.649 --> 01:23:01.531]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:23:01.812 --> 01:23:05.714]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.
[01:23:05.794 --> 01:23:12.599]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, tow line, or boating, quality rope at a price.
[01:23:12.619 --> 01:23:13.360]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:28.519 --> 01:23:32.901]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:23:33.081 --> 01:23:38.784]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:23:38.884 --> 01:23:42.306]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:42.526 --> 01:23:45.147]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:45.247 --> 01:23:50.170]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.550]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:51.950]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:03.174 --> 01:24:15.563]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[01:24:16.024 --> 01:24:21.928]  But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool.
[01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:40.000]  How beautiful.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.600]  We're back live.
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:42.601]  This just in.
[01:24:42.641 --> 01:24:44.702]  I said an hour ago this would be the case.
[01:24:44.802 --> 01:24:45.503]  Not hard to know.
[01:24:46.103 --> 01:24:47.104]  More hysteria.
[01:24:48.154 --> 01:24:51.336]  An ink cartridge tested negative for explosive material.
[01:24:51.376 --> 01:24:57.599]  This is what caused the shutdown of planes and airports and SWAT teams chasing after UPS trucks.
[01:24:58.379 --> 01:24:59.660]  An ink cartridge in England.
[01:25:02.345 --> 01:25:03.485]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[01:25:03.525 --> 01:25:08.687]  I've got some video we've never shown of TSA putting people through body scanners and then patting them down afterwards.
[01:25:09.588 --> 01:25:13.929]  I'm going to take a few phone calls later in the hour for Bob Chapman on the economy or the election.
[01:25:13.949 --> 01:25:15.490]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 Bob, finishing up your point about
[01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:26.954]  The permanent, sustained awakening.
[01:25:27.015 --> 01:25:28.235]  Brzezinski agrees with that.
[01:25:28.776 --> 01:25:33.099]  That people are awake, they're aware of the global corporate structure that controls our politicians.
[01:25:33.419 --> 01:25:47.608]  As Ron Paul has said, once you get past the puppets that identify the Federal Reserve and the global cartel, it's only a matter of time till they fall because people are now identifying the corrupt power structure, not the bait-and-switch of the two parties.
[01:25:47.668 --> 01:25:48.209]  Bob Chapman.
[01:25:55.077 --> 01:26:01.723]  They're not befuddled and fooled by you three, which is nine and a half or whatever it is percent.
[01:26:01.903 --> 01:26:05.826]  They understand and they're forcing themselves to learn.
[01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:08.888]  And we've talked about this in this program before.
[01:26:09.389 --> 01:26:10.470]  And why is that?
[01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:18.316]  Because 15 years we've been hammering away on talk radio and on the Internet and it's working.
[01:26:19.037 --> 01:26:24.101]  The public has become involved and is very concerned in all countries.
[01:26:24.838 --> 01:26:25.779]  About their future.
[01:26:26.319 --> 01:26:30.363]  And so they're listening and they're learning and they're opening their minds up.
[01:26:31.003 --> 01:26:38.189]  And you and I and others are being invited to appear on radio and television and in print throughout the world.
[01:26:38.549 --> 01:26:39.990]  That never happened before.
[01:26:40.491 --> 01:26:42.553]  And so, yes, people are getting educated.
[01:26:43.413 --> 01:26:45.915]  Not all of them and not all of them ever will.
[01:26:46.296 --> 01:26:47.517]  And we can't hope for that.
[01:26:48.137 --> 01:26:52.821]  We need a strong backbone in America and in other countries as well.
[01:26:53.496 --> 01:27:05.867]  To be able to carry forward the truth, and this is what Mr. Brzezinski and all of his ilk, the elitists, this is what they're terrified of, and they are terrified.
[01:27:07.401 --> 01:27:09.723]  Well, they are terrified, Bob.
[01:27:10.003 --> 01:27:19.009]  And 60 Minutes, I'm sure you saw it, last Sunday did a special and said California is 22-plus percent unemployment nationally.
[01:27:19.489 --> 01:27:19.889]  They said 17.6.
[01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:32.017]  In fact, pull up that actual number for me, the headline, 60 Minutes, unemployment 17, that nationally, 22 in California.
[01:27:32.057 --> 01:27:36.981]  But we know California is more than 30, and the national is above 22 percent, Bob.
[01:27:38.761 --> 01:27:40.482]  That's correct.
[01:27:40.502 --> 01:28:00.429]  In fact, it clicked up last month and I'm looking for another click up over the next six months because the money that's been already being shoved into the system started in June through the bond market and the Federal Reserve didn't tell you about that and they're not going to tell you about that because everything they do is a big secret.
[01:28:01.249 --> 01:28:07.271]  The only thing that you hear at these meetings that they have is that yes,
[01:28:08.354 --> 01:28:11.236]  This is what we're going to do when, in fact, they just slough over it.
[01:28:11.737 --> 01:28:13.178]  They're doing all sorts of other things.
[01:28:13.218 --> 01:28:26.509]  So the money that they are going to inject, and I predicted on this program in early July, it was $2.5 plus $2.5 trillion for the next year, two years.
[01:28:27.349 --> 01:28:29.611]  That's $5 trillion in two years.
[01:28:30.372 --> 01:28:31.433]  And that's what they're going to pour in.
[01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.135]  But it's going to go through the same spigots it went before.
[01:28:34.634 --> 01:28:36.216]  It's not going to get down to the people.
[01:28:36.676 --> 01:28:40.581]  And between now and next June, unemployment will move up to 25%.
[01:28:42.883 --> 01:28:51.053]  But the issue here that I want you to speak to briefly before we go to Brighton, come back with more on the economy and the key intel that's now being admitted about the world global government currency.
[01:28:52.714 --> 01:28:57.235]  That they've been trying to deny for two years that it's been above 22% nationwide.
[01:28:58.015 --> 01:29:05.757]  Why would 60 Minutes now come out and admit at least a partial truth, 17-plus nationwide, 22-plus California?
[01:29:05.777 --> 01:29:10.118]  I mean, that's still a whitewash, but it shows they're unable to just lie about everything.
[01:29:10.358 --> 01:29:12.938]  They've lost all credibility, telling us it's 9.6%.
[01:29:13.599 --> 01:29:15.979]  That shows that they are falling apart.
[01:29:17.339 --> 01:29:20.440]  It shows that they're under extreme pressure and it's working on them.
[01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:23.884]  And that figure is 17.1%.
[01:29:25.104 --> 01:29:29.746]  So they're claiming 17.1 nationwide and 22.1 in California?
[01:29:31.627 --> 01:29:33.028]  Um, I don't know that figure.
[01:29:33.148 --> 01:29:34.288]  I don't have it in front of me.
[01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:35.709]  And it's not realistic.
[01:29:36.309 --> 01:29:38.851]  The real figure is over 30% and it's going to get worse.
[01:29:38.971 --> 01:29:41.632]  Yeah, but I'm going to pull up the CBS headline just to make sure.
[01:29:41.652 --> 01:29:46.814]  I mean, I know it's 22 plus and 17 plus, but we'll get the numbers straight ahead on the other side.
[01:29:46.995 --> 01:29:47.455]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.824 --> 01:29:52.805]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.825 --> 01:29:56.525]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.366 --> 01:30:14.809]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:15.836 --> 01:30:19.558]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:20.538 --> 01:30:32.545]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:33.305 --> 01:30:40.569]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:41.249 --> 01:30:50.852]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:30:51.632 --> 01:30:54.894]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:30:55.554 --> 01:30:58.655]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:30:59.255 --> 01:31:03.496]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:03.796 --> 01:31:04.076]  Number 1.
[01:31:04.716 --> 01:31:07.877]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.137 --> 01:31:08.697]  Number 2.
[01:31:08.997 --> 01:31:13.539]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:13.899 --> 01:31:14.319]  It's true.
[01:31:14.639 --> 01:31:19.200]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:20.040]  Number 3.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.621]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:23.921 --> 01:31:27.602]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:27.822 --> 01:31:28.363]  Number 4.
[01:31:28.623 --> 01:31:30.985]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:34.768]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.068 --> 01:31:35.269]  Number 5.
[01:31:35.849 --> 01:31:39.772]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:39.993 --> 01:31:44.757]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:50.503 --> 01:32:53.164]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.861 --> 01:33:11.181]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:11.261 --> 01:33:14.642]  Choose a side the great battle for liberty is on.
[01:33:16.623 --> 01:33:21.984]  Our planet is littered with the wreckage of dead empires and countries that have fallen to corruption.
[01:33:22.664 --> 01:33:27.425]  We don't want to go into this dark age of neo-pedalistic technocratic fascism.
[01:33:28.045 --> 01:33:34.207]  We want to reignite the flames of liberty worldwide and bring the globalists to their knees.
[01:33:34.487 --> 01:33:35.167]  Crank this up!
[01:33:41.296 --> 01:33:45.898]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand, there's no turning back.
[01:33:45.918 --> 01:33:48.179]  The funeral sounds, the charge begins.
[01:33:48.219 --> 01:33:51.061]  Battle is battlefield, no one wins.
[01:33:51.081 --> 01:33:54.522]  The smell of arsenic, smoke, and horses breath.
[01:34:00.558 --> 01:34:01.459]  We are live.
[01:34:01.539 --> 01:34:03.540]  It is Friday, October 29th, 2010.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:09.464]  Can you believe that this year, O10 is almost gone?
[01:34:10.885 --> 01:34:14.427]  Then it'll be 2011, 2012, and beyond.
[01:34:14.447 --> 01:34:24.134]  And we're going in, through, and beyond as we all spin through the galaxy and through the universe on this tiny planet orbiting that little sun.
[01:34:25.914 --> 01:34:28.195]  Life is so magical, so incredible.
[01:34:28.715 --> 01:34:30.035]  Every day is a blessing.
[01:34:30.956 --> 01:34:35.797]  Every bit of liberty we have is because our ancestors fought and scraped and battled for it.
[01:34:36.698 --> 01:34:40.779]  And now, that decision is before us once again.
[01:34:41.559 --> 01:34:42.780]  Will our ancestors
[01:34:44.008 --> 01:34:46.730]  Looking down on us from Valhalla, from heaven.
[01:34:47.670 --> 01:34:48.931]  Be pleased with what we've done.
[01:34:49.251 --> 01:34:57.836]  Will our progeny, our future grandchildren and their grandchildren, will they remember us as people that rose to the challenge against tyranny?
[01:34:58.596 --> 01:35:00.798]  Or succumbed to total dehumanization?
[01:35:01.338 --> 01:35:02.799]  We can roll back the corruption.
[01:35:02.839 --> 01:35:04.380]  We can roll back the police state.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.241]  We can take back our republic.
[01:35:06.781 --> 01:35:08.462]  But that is up to you.
[01:35:09.402 --> 01:35:13.285]  If you want to know where the solution lies, look in the mirror.
[01:35:14.696 --> 01:35:15.136]  All right.
[01:35:16.017 --> 01:35:20.240]  Going back to Bob Chapman, then Michael, Bill, Chris, Brad, Trevor, and others.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.881]  We'll get to your calls before Bob leaves us.
[01:35:22.241 --> 01:35:26.685]  I haven't even gotten to the big economic news yet, but we are about to cover it in detail.
[01:35:29.158 --> 01:35:32.281]  First, I want to tell you about a few of the great sponsors that made today's radio transmission possible.
[01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:34.963]  One of them is the amazing Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:35:34.983 --> 01:35:35.984]  It looks like a water cooler.
[01:35:36.324 --> 01:35:39.087]  A high-tech R2-D2 without a water bottle on its head.
[01:35:39.487 --> 01:35:46.413]  It grabs over 7 gallons a day of crystal clear water, runs it through 7 filters in their most inexpensive unit, their NextUp unit, 12 filters.
[01:35:47.594 --> 01:35:49.235]  It's kind of overkill, but whatever.
[01:35:49.596 --> 01:35:51.597]  Point is, it's awesome stuff.
[01:35:51.778 --> 01:35:53.519]  Great, super high quality.
[01:35:53.879 --> 01:35:55.501]  Okolablue.com.
[01:35:55.621 --> 01:35:57.983]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:35:58.303 --> 01:36:00.225]  Or give them a call for a free information package.
[01:36:00.465 --> 01:36:02.026]  Got a lot of specials running right now.
[01:36:02.046 --> 01:36:02.086]  800-691-6043.
[01:36:05.069 --> 01:36:08.693]  And they've got free shipping if you get your order in by November 1st.
[01:36:08.793 --> 01:36:09.453]  Free shipping.
[01:36:09.754 --> 01:36:14.539]  That is a $87 discount on average to ship these babies.
[01:36:15.079 --> 01:36:17.201]  And they've got a lot of other specials going on.
[01:36:17.221 --> 01:36:18.362]  They've got layaway plans.
[01:36:18.402 --> 01:36:18.923]  AkolaBlue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:36:18.943 --> 01:36:20.384]  The purest, cleanest drinking water.
[01:36:20.404 --> 01:36:20.645]  Period.
[01:36:20.665 --> 01:36:21.345]  AkolaBlue.com.
[01:36:27.151 --> 01:36:33.894]  And one other great sponsor that's got systems to bury your guns safely, that's got safe houses, safe rooms, bunkers.
[01:36:34.494 --> 01:36:35.875]  Prepared.pro.
[01:36:35.995 --> 01:36:38.256]  P-R-E-P-A-R-E-D-P-R-O.
[01:36:38.616 --> 01:36:40.557]  Prepared.pro.
[01:36:40.677 --> 01:36:42.338]  It's Safe Castle LLC.
[01:36:42.478 --> 01:36:43.778]  Wonderful sponsor.
[01:36:43.818 --> 01:36:46.139]  These folks have been in the readiness business for 10 years.
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:49.621]  They're fond of saying they're in the business of selling steel-plated peace of mind.
[01:36:49.941 --> 01:36:51.742]  They sell everything you need and more.
[01:36:52.062 --> 01:36:54.103]  To be ready for what's coming down the pike.
[01:36:54.143 --> 01:36:58.085]  Survival gear, supplies, and even steel-plated underground shelters and safe rooms.
[01:36:58.445 --> 01:37:03.387]  Prepared.pro or banners up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:37:03.627 --> 01:37:07.729]  Now, I want to get to phone calls here with Bob Chapman today.
[01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:11.451]  But Bob, obviously, here's the big news on the economic front.
[01:37:11.731 --> 01:37:14.993]  I want to get your take on this and anything else you think is absolutely key.
[01:37:15.013 --> 01:37:17.214]  Then we'll briefly look at gold and then go to phone calls.
[01:37:17.454 --> 01:37:18.975]  You're with us until five after next hour.
[01:37:18.995 --> 01:37:20.936]  And we have a guest joining us from Australia.
[01:37:21.676 --> 01:37:23.436]  This is out of the Christian Science Monitor.
[01:37:23.917 --> 01:37:26.157]  And this doesn't tell Bob Chapman anything he didn't know.
[01:37:26.437 --> 01:37:28.278]  It doesn't tell our listeners anything they didn't know.
[01:37:28.618 --> 01:37:40.620]  But the fact that it's being announced, every few days I see similar articles to this, lets you know that we're now entering that system where they implode the globe's currencies with coordinated devaluation.
[01:37:40.741 --> 01:37:42.841]  Open G20 policy now for 18 months.
[01:37:43.261 --> 01:37:50.963]  It was already their policy secretly for a decade, but publicly announced that inflation, that's the New York Times headline, inflation, Bernanke says,
[01:37:51.283 --> 01:37:52.365]  We'll fix the debt.
[01:37:52.385 --> 01:37:57.336]  Yeah, that's like if one leg's chopped off, chopping off the other and shooting yourself five times in the head will fix it.
[01:37:57.616 --> 01:37:58.458]  No, it will not fix it.
[01:37:59.778 --> 01:38:00.638]  We know the plan.
[01:38:00.658 --> 01:38:02.699]  People keep saying, where's the global currency, Alex?
[01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:03.599]  Where's the global currency?
[01:38:03.639 --> 01:38:04.479]  Well, we told you.
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:07.360]  That's why I've always talked about this Amero stuff.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.541]  That was one plan, but not the plan that they green-lighted.
[01:38:11.061 --> 01:38:20.904]  They've always said CFR, Trilateral Commission, UN, Rand Corporation, discussed them all, but the main plan they've always been preparing that is a bypass of everything right to the finish line,
[01:38:21.624 --> 01:38:24.266]  I'm going to do this very simply here for people that don't understand this.
[01:38:24.926 --> 01:38:30.470]  They already have a regional Asian currency where they try to unify their prices through the Asian Union.
[01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:33.912]  They have the European Union that's openly unified their currency.
[01:38:34.252 --> 01:38:39.916]  And then they already have dollarization for Canada, Mexico, and much of Latin America and the Caribbean and areas of the Pacific.
[01:38:40.396 --> 01:38:45.782]  But that's halved up between the Asian cartel and the Anglo-American cartel.
[01:38:46.303 --> 01:38:53.511]  What they're doing is with SDRs, the IMF and World Bank start global VAT taxes, they get governments to pass and then pay in, to back it up.
[01:38:54.232 --> 01:38:59.157]  Global carbon taxes, travel taxes, and a raft of other taxes.
[01:39:00.031 --> 01:39:00.891]  that are fed into it.
[01:39:01.172 --> 01:39:04.053]  That supposedly then gives it limited fractional reserve backing.
[01:39:04.553 --> 01:39:07.134]  They're already in the trillions every year trading SDRs.
[01:39:07.154 --> 01:39:12.717]  They're already denominating foreign shipments under the USPS Postal Service under SDRs.
[01:39:12.777 --> 01:39:15.478]  It's 1.5 SDRs for every dollar.
[01:39:16.999 --> 01:39:17.279]  What is it?
[01:39:17.719 --> 01:39:20.061]  1.3 SDRs for every euro.
[01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:23.302]  And we already have the global currency.
[01:39:23.602 --> 01:39:27.364]  Then they just have to get all the countries to agree that their currencies will be governed by this group.
[01:39:27.404 --> 01:39:28.605]  They'll control the interest rates.
[01:39:29.775 --> 01:39:34.499]  This basically gives the private Federal Reserve cartel global control over the whole system.
[01:39:34.859 --> 01:39:36.481]  And here's the Christian Science Monitor.
[01:39:36.961 --> 01:39:46.730]  So you'll still have your dollar, you'll still have your euro, your yen, but it is set by the G20 and the private IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im, International Bank of Settlements cartel.
[01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:51.274]  Now, that's Alex Jones telling you that for 15 years, Bob Chapman for 40 plus.
[01:39:51.674 --> 01:39:53.315]  We knew by the 70s the exact plan.
[01:39:53.335 --> 01:39:55.557]  This is all directly trilateral commission from 1975-76.
[01:39:58.639 --> 01:40:00.220]  Is hard currency on its way out?
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.001]  Introducing the new virtual world currency.
[01:40:03.021 --> 01:40:06.062]  I'll give you a document cam shot of this for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:40:06.402 --> 01:40:14.886]  The new virtual world currency is an index of the world's 15 largest economies, weighed by their gross domestic product, adjusted for purchasing power, parity.
[01:40:15.646 --> 01:40:18.067]  So that's the new SDR Global Index.
[01:40:19.628 --> 01:40:22.671]  And they go on to say, when discussing reserve currency alternatives to the U.S.
[01:40:22.691 --> 01:40:31.020]  dollar, Conversion almost inevitably returns the International Monetary Fund's systemic reserve asset, or the special drawing right, SDR.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:41.831]  And then they go on here to announce exactly what we told you they would do, but now they've got to further destroy the currencies to do that, so they're going to run them up
[01:40:42.151 --> 01:40:47.994]  Well it's a very big thing and it was preceded here about a year ago by another minor announcement and some of the major countries buying SDRs.
[01:41:11.292 --> 01:41:14.334]  And the reason for that was for funding purposes.
[01:41:15.215 --> 01:41:31.006]  And as you know, the IMF has been a seller of gold, although I don't think they've sold as much as they say that they have, because I think some of that gold was sold previously, and it was a short covering operation which India handled.
[01:41:31.646 --> 01:41:34.268]  And some of these nations that are supposedly buying gold
[01:41:35.558 --> 01:41:41.400]  I don't think they got the money to buy it in the first place, so I think some of them are bogus transactions.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:55.744]  And I noticed they weren't selling any to Russia, and every time they sold gold into the market, which they said they wouldn't do, and the reason was to suppress the price, the Russians were there buying it all, every single time they went in.
[01:41:56.584 --> 01:41:58.104]  And so the Russians know what's up.
[01:41:59.085 --> 01:42:03.986]  And they're not going to get their global currency to any further level
[01:42:04.674 --> 01:42:06.135]  Then an international trade.
[01:42:06.475 --> 01:42:07.836]  It'll never go further than that.
[01:42:08.156 --> 01:42:17.000]  And one of the reasons why is they don't want to put a basis on that currency, the SDR or the bank core.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:22.503]  They don't want to put a backing on that currency.
[01:42:22.923 --> 01:42:24.163]  And that's why it'll never work.
[01:42:24.804 --> 01:42:27.845]  You've got to have gold or gold and silver backing.
[01:42:28.225 --> 01:42:30.206]  And if you don't, it's not going to work.
[01:42:30.967 --> 01:42:31.407]  It's the
[01:42:33.138 --> 01:43:00.213]  The temptation for politicians worldwide is so great when you have a currency of any kind that has no backing, which the backing acts as a suppressor on the currency so that those who are running the currency, central bank, a government, whatever it is, it doesn't allow them to create more and more and more currency.
[01:43:00.951 --> 01:43:06.195]  And so they don't want that and that's why they'll not work and I don't think we'll get to a digital currency.
[01:43:06.795 --> 01:43:25.207]  There's going to be a lot of uproar of all kinds worldwide that's going to be caused by the fact that we continue to make predictions that come true and we continue to tell more people every day what's going on and we are going to stop them.
[01:43:27.068 --> 01:43:49.959]  Now, again, just to finish up what their plan is, whether they can get it done or not, is that then you still have some paper currency controlled globally, but most transactions are digital, based in SDRs, and you must thumbprint or face scan as part of the new VAT and global sales tax to apportion that, because under $50,000 a year, you're going to, quote, be exempt.
[01:43:50.539 --> 01:43:54.341]  What do you make of silver subject to price manipulation?
[01:43:55.642 --> 01:44:03.847]  And there's now been a, this came out two days ago, a lawsuit and criminal investigations of major banks engaged in silver suppression.
[01:44:05.388 --> 01:44:10.392]  Well, first of all, the CFTC didn't want to carry it forward.
[01:44:10.432 --> 01:44:13.114]  That is the Commodity Refuges Trading Corporation.
[01:44:13.774 --> 01:44:14.935]  And they're an arm of the U.S.
[01:44:14.975 --> 01:44:15.376]  government.
[01:44:15.456 --> 01:44:17.237]  And they've been trying to put it off and put it off.
[01:44:17.837 --> 01:44:24.262]  Finally, two days ago, when the lawsuit came, now, I said that there was a lawsuit and
[01:44:25.551 --> 01:44:33.778]  I think it's, I said in May, I said, but I'm not going to say anything more about it because I don't want to disrupt what's going on at the law firm.
[01:44:34.658 --> 01:44:47.609]  And I have a whole bunch of information in Saturday's publication, which is tomorrow in the International Forecaster, tells you how to join the lawsuit in the name of the attorney and the phone number.
[01:44:48.089 --> 01:44:48.790]  Everything's there.
[01:44:49.230 --> 01:44:53.053]  And it's important because everybody who owns silver coin, silver bullion,
[01:44:54.915 --> 01:44:55.215]  I don't
[01:45:14.454 --> 01:45:20.816]  They wouldn't allow to go forward several years ago because they said there was no standing, which is not true, but that's not the point.
[01:45:21.076 --> 01:45:28.878]  Now the word is, Bob, briefly, because I need to get the calls here and a brief pop in from Ted, or maybe I'll hold you over a little bit, but we've got a guest from Australia coming up.
[01:45:29.879 --> 01:45:34.340]  Bob, this is connected to GATA, isn't it, and their inside sources?
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:44.183]  Yes, it is, but I've been in that for 40 years more than GATA has, and I've been tracking these people.
[01:45:45.004 --> 01:45:47.005]  And, uh, it's happening.
[01:45:47.205 --> 01:45:48.006]  What's going to happen?
[01:45:49.487 --> 01:45:51.748]  I think Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank could go under.
[01:45:52.749 --> 01:45:54.770]  And they have a lot of other problems besides this.
[01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:58.952]  And I think JPMorgan Chase could be taken to the edge.
[01:45:59.392 --> 01:46:03.955]  I think what they're going to use as an excuse is that we were acting on behalf of the U.S.
[01:46:03.995 --> 01:46:04.355]  government.
[01:46:04.535 --> 01:46:05.816]  Well, you've been saying that for years.
[01:46:05.856 --> 01:46:09.238]  You said lawsuits would come and then they would say we were acting under orders.
[01:46:10.399 --> 01:46:11.119]  And that's okay.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:12.360]  Let them do that.
[01:46:13.072 --> 01:46:15.414]  But you see, the game for them is over.
[01:46:16.235 --> 01:46:18.097]  They can't continue to do that.
[01:46:18.977 --> 01:46:22.060]  Because everybody in the world is going to know that they're rigging it.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:29.166]  And they're going to know that all of the talk that's gone out about rigging the stock market is now true.
[01:46:29.907 --> 01:46:35.232]  There's going to be a hue and cry from people, particularly in the United States, that this has got to stop.
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:41.284]  Now, Bob, we're almost out of time because I've got to come back and take calls for two short segments, but I want you to be able to continue on this.
[01:46:41.304 --> 01:46:50.730]  But we've only got three minutes before break, and I wanted to bring Ted Anderson in and give people a gold pitch at incredibly good prices to start protecting themselves.
[01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:52.271]  Gold is racing back up.
[01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:55.673]  Where do you see gold in the near future, Bob?
[01:46:56.713 --> 01:46:57.954]  I see it much higher.
[01:46:58.635 --> 01:47:03.938]  Please take advantage of Ted's offerings, and I feel tragically
[01:47:05.191 --> 01:47:31.367]  Awful about all of these people have said gold we're going to go down and now it's going flying right back up again My heart goes out to you Yeah, it's all part of the system trying to spook people away from it, but there's overall Currency devaluation that's going to reflect commodities going up mainly gold and silver Ted Anderson a good to have you here Give us your take on this announcement of the global currency and all these mainstream publications and tell us today's gold and silver offers
[01:47:31.943 --> 01:47:35.908]  Well, the one that bothers me the most, Alex, is that Bloomberg article that they posted.
[01:47:35.928 --> 01:47:39.914]  It says, gold will outlive the dollar once the slaughter comes.
[01:47:39.974 --> 01:47:41.256]  It's by John Hathaway.
[01:47:41.336 --> 01:47:47.925]  And just the first chapter, real quick, it says, the world's monetary system is in the process of melting down.
[01:47:49.209 --> 01:47:50.930]  We have entered into the endgame.
[01:47:50.991 --> 01:47:51.991]  They must be listening to you.
[01:47:52.011 --> 01:48:01.459]  We have entered into the endgame for the dollar as the denominated reserve currency, but most investors and policy makers are unaware of its implications.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:02.961]  People have to read this article.
[01:48:02.981 --> 01:48:03.721]  They can call us for it.
[01:48:03.761 --> 01:48:04.662]  We'll mail it to you.
[01:48:05.123 --> 01:48:07.044]  But you ought to post it on the website.
[01:48:07.144 --> 01:48:08.245]  I mean, my God.
[01:48:09.626 --> 01:48:11.507]  I can't believe that one came from Bloomberg.
[01:48:11.728 --> 01:48:12.808]  Yeah, gold is running up.
[01:48:12.868 --> 01:48:13.489]  Silver went up.
[01:48:13.929 --> 01:48:16.551]  Silver's at $24.62.
[01:48:16.631 --> 01:48:18.272]  Gold is up over $1,360.
[01:48:19.132 --> 01:48:25.936]  I mean, the market is just raging right back upward after this little manipulation that we had a couple of days ago.
[01:48:25.956 --> 01:48:28.058]  And I just can't say it enough.
[01:48:29.158 --> 01:48:34.141]  People really, really need to move into gold and silver, and they have to get away from the U.S.
[01:48:34.181 --> 01:48:34.502]  dollar.
[01:48:35.302 --> 01:48:36.683]  That's just the bottom line.
[01:48:36.703 --> 01:48:39.244]  I mean, the food and everything else, they need it too.
[01:48:39.264 --> 01:48:45.468]  But I just need to say, if you're sitting in dollar-denominated assets, man, you better wake up.
[01:48:45.648 --> 01:48:47.229]  Well, Chad, that's another point.
[01:48:47.269 --> 01:48:53.052]  We told people a year ago that they were going to run up the prices of food because the big central banks were manipulating it.
[01:48:53.092 --> 01:48:54.193]  Now that's all over the news.
[01:48:54.233 --> 01:48:57.535]  But there's the Bloomberg headline on screen for folks.
[01:48:57.855 --> 01:48:58.555]  I hadn't seen it.
[01:48:58.635 --> 01:49:01.437]  Gold will outlive dollar once slaughter comes.
[01:49:01.957 --> 01:49:05.919]  And they're saying the endgame of the destruction of the dollar has begun.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:10.582]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't own gold and silver as an investment, though it's become a great one.
[01:49:10.942 --> 01:49:14.725]  I own it as an emergency backup to continue this operation, the meager amounts we have.
[01:49:15.385 --> 01:49:16.986]  But the poor man's gold is silver.
[01:49:17.406 --> 01:49:18.807]  It's pegged to gold going up.
[01:49:19.448 --> 01:49:25.051]  Ted, briefly, you've got a bunch of great deals, but you're running out of the gold you bought when it went down, the silver you bought.
[01:49:25.091 --> 01:49:26.172]  It's going to go up soon.
[01:49:26.932 --> 01:49:28.273]  Tell folks about today's offer.
[01:49:28.593 --> 01:49:30.393]  Yeah, walking Liberty Halves at $11.77.
[01:49:30.733 --> 01:49:35.174]  They're almost at $14 a piece now, and my prices have to go up.
[01:49:36.055 --> 01:49:41.816]  The Creature from Jekyll Island, I had to raise that to $31 now, just because the book costs went up there.
[01:49:42.056 --> 01:49:48.797]  People now with silver at $24.62, silver dollars are over $31 each just for the one.
[01:49:49.218 --> 01:49:50.478]  You know, and you get the book for free.
[01:49:50.538 --> 01:49:50.838]  I don't know.
[01:49:51.138 --> 01:49:52.698]  People need to know about the Fed.
[01:49:52.718 --> 01:49:55.859]  They need to know about Keynesianism, because that's what's killing this economy.
[01:49:55.879 --> 01:50:03.281]  Well, to be clear, they get the free 1995 book, or you buy the book and then you get the free silver dollar, and it's $31, folks.
[01:50:03.321 --> 01:50:04.161]  That is a great deal.
[01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:04.242]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:04.262 --> 01:50:04.322]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:04.342 --> 01:50:06.302]  Ted's got great deals on gold, fifth ounce francs.
[01:50:16.145 --> 01:50:25.374]  Quarter-ounce sovereigns a lot of other great specials, but tell them it's the Alex Jones radio special to get the super lost leader smoking deals Or it'll be a little bit more.
[01:50:25.694 --> 01:50:29.537]  That's still a great price 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 what are some of the other coins real fast?
[01:50:29.558 --> 01:50:30.438]  You've got a special deal Ted
[01:50:36.664 --> 01:50:40.985]  Well, the frank at $2.93, you get a full years of the International Forecaster.
[01:50:41.005 --> 01:50:44.426]  I mean, $20 Liberties, if you want the older 20s, are at $16.39.
[01:50:45.026 --> 01:50:45.266]  U.S.
[01:50:45.386 --> 01:50:50.068]  Eagles, Buffalos, junk silver, whatever it is that you're in the market for, you better be moving now.
[01:50:50.088 --> 01:50:51.588]  800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, or modestresources.com.
[01:50:51.628 --> 01:50:52.188]  Thank you, Chad.

[01:50:59.687 --> 01:51:00.947]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:06.329]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:06.569 --> 01:51:11.211]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:11.991]  It's true.
[01:51:12.071 --> 01:51:16.633]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:17.173 --> 01:51:21.854]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:54:07.953 --> 01:54:10.976]  So I'm going to cover this right before we get the next guest on at 8 after.
[01:54:12.076 --> 01:54:13.978]  The White House has put out a press release.
[01:54:14.458 --> 01:54:15.599]  It's up on the Drudge Report.
[01:54:16.079 --> 01:54:20.803]  I'm going to have Watson do a story on this, how Bush issued fake terror alerts, and how Obama's doing it.
[01:54:21.829 --> 01:54:30.817]  Obama got the word from the British about a deadly printer cartridge that didn't have explosives in it, so he ordered the sweeps as part of pre-election fear-mongering.
[01:54:31.838 --> 01:54:32.958]  White House press release.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.581]  I mean, it's just hidden in plain view.
[01:54:36.401 --> 01:54:39.364]  Let's go to Michael in Florida.
[01:54:39.784 --> 01:54:41.225]  Michael, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:54:41.245 --> 01:54:41.606]  Go ahead.
[01:54:43.087 --> 01:54:44.028]  Hey, what's up Alex?
[01:54:44.068 --> 01:54:44.708]  What's up Bob?
[01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.869]  Hey buddy, what's up?
[01:54:45.889 --> 01:54:46.290]  What's going on?
[01:54:48.604 --> 01:54:56.310]  Well, I was just thinking, like, how are they going to change the money to this FDR currency without letting us see what's in the reserve?
[01:54:57.111 --> 01:55:01.595]  Like, that's sort of something that they can't be so fast to do.
[01:55:01.615 --> 01:55:03.957]  Well, they're already doing it with the Federal Reserve here.
[01:55:03.977 --> 01:55:13.625]  The other thing is, you know, we have to uncover the corruption is basically like back
[01:55:14.204 --> 01:55:41.414]  from the voting scam in 2000 which allowed Bush to you know also scam his way in 2004 into another election like we have to look at things like that because it's not really we get caught up and get upset at Bush or whatever but he's just a puppet well said Michael let me get Bob Chapman's take on your point Bob I agree and
[01:55:42.668 --> 01:55:48.631]  And I also agree that this package was just nothing but fear mongering.
[01:55:49.332 --> 01:55:52.033]  And we've got to get the right people elected.
[01:55:52.454 --> 01:55:55.135]  Florida looks like it's on the right track with Rubino.
[01:55:55.976 --> 01:55:58.697]  And I mention that because you're from there.
[01:55:59.357 --> 01:56:06.862]  And I think that all the states have got to work very, very hard about getting themselves solvent.
[01:56:07.462 --> 01:56:08.923]  How they're going to do that, I don't know.
[01:56:09.903 --> 01:56:10.764]  But they're going to have to.
[01:56:11.617 --> 01:56:13.698]  Otherwise, you're going to have to lay off an awful lot of people.
[01:56:15.639 --> 01:56:17.540]  But we're all pushing in the right direction.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:26.945]  We're outraged, and if that's what it took to get people to listen to what Alex and others have to say, then that's fine.
[01:56:27.685 --> 01:56:31.247]  And I think it's going to end up very, very well in the future.
[01:56:31.407 --> 01:56:32.408]  You can't wait to see.
[01:56:32.808 --> 01:56:34.249]  Let's talk to Bill in Wisconsin.
[01:56:34.269 --> 01:56:35.029]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:56:35.049 --> 01:56:37.610]  Yeah, Alex, how you been?
[01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:38.231]  Good, brother.
[01:56:38.271 --> 01:56:38.591]  What's up?
[01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:43.612]  Well, a couple things, and then I do have a question for Bob.
[01:56:44.313 --> 01:56:50.318]  But first of all, we've got a House race here, 7th Congressional District.
[01:56:51.238 --> 01:56:55.342]  Dave Obie retired, which was a surprise.
[01:56:56.022 --> 01:57:08.432]  But the Republicans are putting up what I believe is a neocon subversive, Sean Duffy, prosecutor from up north, Ashland County.
[01:57:09.045 --> 01:57:12.707]  Democratic area, never had any opposition.
[01:57:13.587 --> 01:57:21.910]  He's brought in Newt Gingrich, and you know what Newt has done on NAFTA, GATT, everything else.
[01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:22.751]  Carbon taxes.
[01:57:23.271 --> 01:57:25.452]  Carbon taxes, open borders.
[01:57:26.292 --> 01:57:30.414]  This weekend he's bringing in Rudy Giuliani.
[01:57:30.654 --> 01:57:31.054]  Oh boy.
[01:57:31.514 --> 01:57:32.515]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:32.655 --> 01:57:38.077]  So a lot of the people here are buffaloed, but there is a candidate
[01:57:38.735 --> 01:57:40.496]  Running as an independent.
[01:57:41.096 --> 01:57:50.498]  So if you're in the congressional district, 7th district in Wisconsin, go to GaryCrawford.com.
[01:57:50.578 --> 01:57:51.839]  Okay, we're almost out of time.
[01:57:52.139 --> 01:57:53.199]  What's your question for Bob?
[01:57:53.839 --> 01:58:02.502]  Okay, my question for Bob is, Gerald Cilenti says we're going to have a collapse before the end of the year.
[01:58:02.602 --> 01:58:03.862]  What's your take on that?
[01:58:05.082 --> 01:58:07.303]  Well, I'm sorry to inform you that I don't think so.
[01:58:08.497 --> 01:58:12.903]  And Gerald also said that goal was going to get down to 1250.
[01:58:13.724 --> 01:58:16.808]  And I'm sorry that he did because that's not where it's headed.
[01:58:16.869 --> 01:58:17.870]  It's headed the other way.
[01:58:18.611 --> 01:58:25.380]  But, you know, we have to be very calm and very balanced
[01:58:25.999 --> 01:58:29.161]  ...in our approach to the information that we receive.
[01:58:29.981 --> 01:58:31.061]  And... Bob, stay there.
[01:58:31.101 --> 01:58:31.982]  We gotta come back.
[01:58:32.162 --> 01:58:32.862]  Finish that point.
[01:58:32.902 --> 01:58:33.863]  We'll take a few more calls.
[01:58:34.403 --> 01:58:35.684]  But it depends on how you look at it.
[01:58:35.704 --> 01:58:38.985]  I mean, we're in a collapse right now with 22% unemployment.
[01:58:43.207 --> 01:58:47.089]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.901 --> 01:58:55.326]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:56.547 --> 01:59:01.331]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:01.691 --> 01:59:08.497]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:10.419 --> 01:59:12.701]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:14.503 --> 01:59:16.785]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:59:28.568 --> 01:59:30.449]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:32.229]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:59:32.489 --> 01:59:35.050]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:41.651]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:59:42.011 --> 01:59:44.232]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:59:44.712 --> 01:59:46.132]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:59:46.292 --> 01:59:46.733]  Got it.
[01:59:47.073 --> 01:59:47.953]  Others don't.
[01:59:52.392 --> 01:59:54.314]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.794 --> 01:59:57.677]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.322 --> 02:00:04.963]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.623 --> 02:00:06.684]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.385 --> 02:00:08.526]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.146 --> 02:00:09.967]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.747 --> 02:00:11.708]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.289 --> 02:00:15.952]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.472 --> 02:00:20.536]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.004 --> 02:00:27.325]  Okay, I want to cram in a few more calls, and we'll get to everybody else that's holding after Bob leaves us.
[02:00:27.805 --> 02:00:29.946]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:00:30.666 --> 02:00:42.029]  Bob, finishing up your statement about, you know, being calm, we're talking about a further collapse coming down the road, but clearly the degeneration of the economy is accelerating.
[02:00:42.509 --> 02:00:45.830]  I mean, I'm not saying Gerald's 100% right, but I do see your point.
[02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:46.210]  Go ahead.
[02:00:47.431 --> 02:00:51.692]  Yeah, you know, we've talked about this before when, yourself, you thought,
[02:00:52.099 --> 02:00:58.025]  Things were closer than we were, and Paul Craig Robinson said, look, no, you've got to slow down.
[02:00:58.425 --> 02:01:01.588]  Things take a lot longer than you anticipate.
[02:01:02.049 --> 02:01:04.711]  And you find that out by being around as long as we have.
[02:01:05.092 --> 02:01:06.713]  And I'm almost as old as he is.
[02:01:07.294 --> 02:01:10.637]  But the point here is that it's coming, yes it is.
[02:01:11.238 --> 02:01:12.118]  Get prepared.
[02:01:12.559 --> 02:01:16.703]  We don't know what the timing is, but it doesn't make any difference if we're prepared.
[02:01:17.793 --> 02:01:22.796]  Well, as Robert says, I mean, as Robert says, there was a lot of wealth in this country and in Europe.
[02:01:23.116 --> 02:01:24.777]  It takes time for that to drain out.
[02:01:26.077 --> 02:01:26.538]  That's right.
[02:01:26.558 --> 02:01:27.678]  All right, let's go to Chris.
[02:01:27.698 --> 02:01:28.279]  Absolutely.
[02:01:28.359 --> 02:01:29.579]  Let's go to Chris in California.
[02:01:29.859 --> 02:01:31.080]  Chris, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:31.400]  Go ahead.
[02:01:32.521 --> 02:01:32.861]  Hey, Bob.
[02:01:32.901 --> 02:01:33.401]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:33.581 --> 02:01:38.764]  A long time listener, Prison Planet subscriber, and I respect both of you guys quite a bit.
[02:01:40.145 --> 02:01:43.587]  I'm calling from L.A., by the way, your favorite city, Alex.
[02:01:44.307 --> 02:01:45.688]  I just wanted to bring up with Bob.
[02:01:46.467 --> 02:01:47.889]  Kind of a similar question.
[02:01:47.969 --> 02:01:53.555]  I mean, we've kind of gone through, we've been going through this gradual crash for quite a while.
[02:01:53.575 --> 02:02:00.742]  Do you think that it's possible that the globalists could just, you know, have maybe lost control completely at some point?
[02:02:00.762 --> 02:02:05.667]  Maybe some kind of outside force or outside event causes a, maybe a flashpoint?
[02:02:05.687 --> 02:02:08.290]  Maybe that's what Celente is talking about happening before the end of the year?
[02:02:09.073 --> 02:02:12.715]  And my second question is kind of for both of you.
[02:02:12.755 --> 02:02:15.316]  Could you discuss a little bit more about this lame duck session coming up?
[02:02:15.896 --> 02:02:21.618]  I tend to think that it could be actually hugely significant because a route is what it may be.
[02:02:22.038 --> 02:02:35.284]  That might be exactly what the globalists want, a route of the Democrats, because what better fodder would there be for the Democrats to now have, you know, an opportunity or a
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:42.204]  a uh... incentive to be bribed or cashed out as they're basically walking away.
[02:02:42.224 --> 02:02:44.105]  Oh yeah, the lame duck's very dangerous.
[02:02:44.425 --> 02:02:45.286]  Chris, thanks for the call.
[02:02:45.306 --> 02:02:47.047]  Let me get a quick comment from Bob Chapman on that.
[02:02:47.087 --> 02:02:47.327]  Bob?
[02:02:48.048 --> 02:02:53.512]  Well the latter part about the lame duck session is extremely, extremely dangerous.
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:56.281]  And boy, we gotta climb all over people.
[02:02:56.341 --> 02:03:01.243]  And some people who are gonna be voted out, we can't climb on because they just don't care.
[02:03:01.663 --> 02:03:07.045]  And these people who are behind the scenes have paid them and said, look, we paid you off, you gotta do this.
[02:03:07.485 --> 02:03:08.465]  So it is dangerous.
[02:03:09.206 --> 02:03:13.447]  Well, Bob, also remember Obama is still gonna have the U.S.
[02:03:13.507 --> 02:03:14.988]  Attorneys in the Justice Department.
[02:03:15.308 --> 02:03:15.908]  You watch.
[02:03:15.988 --> 02:03:21.010]  They are gonna be trying to set up and frame and go after all these new members of Congress.
[02:03:22.611 --> 02:03:23.631]  That's correct as well.
[02:03:24.287 --> 02:03:35.094]  And, you know, the projection of what's going to happen, the shape it's going to come in, we often don't know until we get rather close.
[02:03:35.674 --> 02:03:36.754]  But we know it's coming.
[02:03:37.675 --> 02:03:43.258]  And, again, it's all preparation, even-handed, even-minded.
[02:03:43.939 --> 02:03:46.120]  We can't go off on tangents.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:52.664]  We've got to zero in on the problems, both on the radio, on the Internet, as well as personally.
[02:03:54.909 --> 02:03:57.170]  Well, these are definitely very serious times.
[02:03:57.190 --> 02:03:59.472]  We're at a global crossroads for humanity.
[02:03:59.492 --> 02:04:17.644]  That's why every liberty lover needs to get even more informed, more active, louder, and point out who's behind this depression, point out who's behind the tyranny, point out who is the main source of our ills, so that these globalists can't pose as our saviors as the crisis deepens and sell us even more tyranny.
[02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:20.349]  Well, you're right about that.
[02:04:20.509 --> 02:04:25.431]  And you and I and others will stop them from getting away with that, so to speak.
[02:04:26.271 --> 02:04:28.491]  Well, Bob, it's always great talking to you.
[02:04:29.131 --> 02:04:33.493]  And God willing, I'll see you again next Friday at one o'clock hour.
[02:04:33.533 --> 02:04:35.693]  We had you on an hour early today.
[02:04:35.773 --> 02:04:39.074]  Have a great weekend and be safe.
[02:04:40.103 --> 02:04:44.466]  Well, thank you, and the same to you, Alex, and thank you all for listening.
[02:04:44.627 --> 02:04:45.087]  Thank you.
[02:04:45.407 --> 02:04:46.268]  There goes Bob Chapman.

[02:06:51.346 --> 02:06:51.746]  Thank you!
[02:06:58.712 --> 02:07:02.955]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:03.275 --> 02:07:03.556]  Number 1.
[02:07:04.196 --> 02:07:07.338]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:08.179]  Number 2.
[02:07:08.479 --> 02:07:13.023]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:13.363 --> 02:07:13.803]  It's true.
[02:07:14.103 --> 02:07:18.667]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:18.987 --> 02:07:19.527]  Number 3.
[02:07:19.808 --> 02:07:23.090]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:27.093]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:27.293 --> 02:07:27.834]  Number 4.
[02:07:28.094 --> 02:07:30.456]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:30.857 --> 02:07:34.240]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:34.541 --> 02:07:34.741]  Number 5.
[02:07:35.321 --> 02:07:39.246]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:39.466 --> 02:07:44.231]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:44.511 --> 02:07:48.533]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:48.674 --> 02:07:50.235]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.475 --> 02:07:52.556]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:52.716 --> 02:07:55.338]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:08:00.941 --> 02:08:06.945]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:07.565 --> 02:08:10.547]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.467 --> 02:08:16.988]  All right, I want to preface this for a few minutes before we go to him.
[02:08:18.049 --> 02:08:23.471]  But I've heard the audio clips online of him on national television, national radio, regional radio.
[02:08:23.951 --> 02:08:25.312]  I love his spirit.
[02:08:25.972 --> 02:08:27.012]  I love his courage.
[02:08:27.833 --> 02:08:33.835]  And he's Kevin Bracken, president of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, one of the most powerful unions in the country.
[02:08:34.215 --> 02:08:35.396]  Sits on government boards.
[02:08:35.876 --> 02:08:39.139]  The Prime Minister and others have demonized him in Australia.
[02:08:39.559 --> 02:08:41.340]  They've tried to tell him to basically shut up.
[02:08:41.681 --> 02:08:45.924]  Other members of Parliament have called for him to be censured or to get in trouble for his free speech.
[02:08:46.304 --> 02:08:52.770]  And the nation has stood up and said, even if some people disagree with him, which is really the minority, he says 50-50, that's what the polls show.
[02:08:53.010 --> 02:08:57.613]  The newspaper polls show over 70% agree with him about 9-11 stinking to high heaven.
[02:08:58.354 --> 02:09:00.456]  But even if you disagree with him, he's got his
[02:09:02.259 --> 02:09:04.382]  Right to common law free speech.
[02:09:05.122 --> 02:09:07.966]  But I want to preface this with some new breaking news.
[02:09:09.528 --> 02:09:19.519]  Last year, Governor Ridge, the former head of Homeland Security, wrote a book and admitted what we'd already gotten from the White House, that Bush would issue fake terror alerts ahead of elections.
[02:09:20.512 --> 02:09:23.095]  The off-year elections and the presidential election of 04.
[02:09:23.595 --> 02:09:25.678]  That is an act of terrorism to issue fake terror alerts.
[02:09:26.178 --> 02:09:35.628]  We know Anwar al-Awlaki, the number one in Al-Qaeda, number three nine years ago, Fox News, AP, Reuters, it's now been leaked.
[02:09:36.249 --> 02:09:40.213]  Was meeting in secret meetings at the Pentagon two months after 9-11 with the Secretary of the Army.
[02:09:40.453 --> 02:09:42.675]  This is the guy that ran the underwear bombing on Christmas Day.
[02:09:43.175 --> 02:09:46.739]  The Hassan shooting, where the government knew and blocked it.
[02:09:47.059 --> 02:09:49.401]  He is a master controller of these patsies.
[02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:51.083]  The Times Square bombing.
[02:09:52.776 --> 02:10:04.164]  Two months ago, Clinton and Obama advisor Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times of London, and Watson's doing an article on this right now, said, without an Oklahoma City bombing or a new 9-11, Obama is over.
[02:10:04.425 --> 02:10:05.685]  And the whole agenda is over.
[02:10:05.906 --> 02:10:09.889]  We must have terror attacks so the President can look strong and look powerful.
[02:10:09.929 --> 02:10:10.929]  I'm paraphrasing the quote.
[02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:12.270]  We've read it many times on air.
[02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:17.674]  In fact, I'm going to pull back up that Financial Times of London headline and the Present Planet headline that has the quote.
[02:10:19.073 --> 02:10:19.673]  What's his name?
[02:10:20.634 --> 02:10:23.955]  Robert Shapiro or Clinton advisor says Obama needs staged terror.
[02:10:24.315 --> 02:10:24.875]  That'll pull it up.
[02:10:24.915 --> 02:10:25.455]  I need that quote.
[02:10:25.475 --> 02:10:26.336]  I forgot to ask you guys.
[02:10:26.356 --> 02:10:28.396]  I want to read the actual quote before our guest leaves us.
[02:10:28.616 --> 02:10:32.358]  He's with us for another 50 minutes and I'm moving quick because this is so important.
[02:10:32.398 --> 02:10:32.538]  Now!
[02:10:34.025 --> 02:10:39.089]  This morning, about four hours ago, they started announcing multiple planes on the tarmac.
[02:10:40.930 --> 02:10:42.031]  Bombs from Yemen.
[02:10:42.452 --> 02:10:43.953]  Oh my gosh, we're all dead.
[02:10:45.514 --> 02:10:51.819]  UPS delivery trucks being stopped in areas of New York, Queens, Long Island.
[02:10:52.499 --> 02:10:57.063]  Hysteria over backpacks at federal buildings, you know, left by school children.
[02:10:58.339 --> 02:11:10.125]  Within 30 minutes of the fear-mongering, and I noticed they had former Governor Keating, who covered up the Oklahoma City event, and others on, saying, well, even if this doesn't turn out to be real, it shows how we're trying to save you and how Al-Qaeda wants to hit us.
[02:11:12.146 --> 02:11:25.253]  And I said when we started the show, two hours before this came out, it's now on Drudge Report, CNN, more hysteria, ink cartridge tested negative for explosive material, starting in England,
[02:11:26.112 --> 02:11:35.519]  Yesterday, during the afternoon in England, they get an ink cartridge out, in a shipment of ink cartridges, and they think it's a bomb, no explosive residue.
[02:11:35.879 --> 02:11:52.371]  Now, I said first hour, the White House is behind this, 99% chance, ahead of the election in three days, to demonize people, to demonize opposition against the war, and to make himself look like a strong leader.
[02:11:52.651 --> 02:11:53.852]  And they may stage other stuff.
[02:11:55.256 --> 02:12:04.062]  Now it's admitted no bomb residue, completely made up, and there's a statement by the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs at WhiteHouse.gov.
[02:12:04.262 --> 02:12:05.383]  This is also up on Drudge.
[02:12:05.663 --> 02:12:07.804]  It's also all gone up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:12:09.045 --> 02:12:15.149]  Last night, intelligence and law enforcement agencies discovered potential suspicious packages on two planes in transit in the United States.
[02:12:15.590 --> 02:12:16.170]  Based on those,
[02:12:17.773 --> 02:12:18.734]  Cooperating among U.S.
[02:12:18.754 --> 02:12:29.821]  government agencies and with our foreign allies and partners, authorities were able to identify and examine two suspicious packages, one in East Midlands, United Kingdom, and the other from Dubai.
[02:12:30.101 --> 02:12:31.762]  Both these packages originated from Yemen.
[02:12:32.063 --> 02:12:39.868]  As a result, security precautions triggered this threat, and additional measures were taken regarding the flights at Newark, Liberty, and Philadelphia International Airports.
[02:12:40.528 --> 02:12:43.931]  The President was notified of a potential terror threat on Thursday night.
[02:12:44.631 --> 02:12:48.173]  By John Brennan, Assistant to the President of Homeland Security Counterterrorism.
[02:12:48.733 --> 02:12:50.214]  The President directed U.S.
[02:12:50.254 --> 02:13:06.702]  intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the Department of Homeland Security to take steps to ensure the safety and security of the American people and to determine whether these threats, as part of an additional terrorism plotting, the President will receive regular updates from the national security team he has alerted to the threat.
[02:13:07.182 --> 02:13:08.964]  This was issued just about 30 minutes ago.
[02:13:09.044 --> 02:13:15.009]  So, they knew when they swiped it and tested it for bombs, takes about 10 seconds, that there was no explosives in the printer cartridge.
[02:13:16.230 --> 02:13:22.015]  We pull a printer cartridge out of a printer and we'll show people what causes, you know, lockdowns on the East Coast, but pull one out.
[02:13:22.055 --> 02:13:22.856]  I want to show it to people.
[02:13:23.196 --> 02:13:24.917]  You know, this evil devil weapon.
[02:13:25.698 --> 02:13:27.179]  Now here's the Financial Times of London.
[02:13:27.239 --> 02:13:32.223]  Obama faces growing credibility crisis, and we're going to our guest, and he's quoted in here,
[02:13:33.556 --> 02:13:54.859]  Uh, is saying, quote, the bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, says Robert Shapiro, Clinton official and Obama supporter, he also advises him, quote, he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think of how he could do that.
[02:13:55.848 --> 02:14:00.730]  Now, that was in July 13, 2010, three months ago.
[02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:24.858]  I take you now to Australia, to a great patriot, I'm going to read some of his quotes coming up later, of Kevin Bracken, President of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, and the VTHC is the Coordination of Union Activities and Campaigns with the Union, and it goes on, he also sits on some government boards, and the issue here is, he's gone public for 9-11 Truth, he's an engineer,
[02:14:26.038 --> 02:14:29.219]  Trades Hall President Kevin Bracken stands by his 9-11 conspiracy.
[02:14:29.479 --> 02:14:30.419]  He was demonized.
[02:14:30.799 --> 02:14:35.441]  And here are his quotes when he was demonized on national media when he got a chance to respond.
[02:14:36.361 --> 02:14:41.422]  He said, unfortunately, cowards like yourself have set the political agenda in this country for too long, said Kevin Bracken.
[02:14:41.763 --> 02:14:45.384]  I won't be cowered down to bullies like yourself.
[02:14:46.644 --> 02:14:49.385]  And he just went through the controlled demolition information.
[02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:52.711]  And the Prime Minister is blasphemy.
[02:14:52.731 --> 02:14:55.374]  Many have called for him to get in trouble for his free speech.
[02:14:55.935 --> 02:15:04.984]  Joining us, we got a lot of listeners in Australia as well on the internet and satellite, is Kevin Bracken, a great patriot there in Australia.
[02:15:05.024 --> 02:15:05.985]  Sir, great to have you on.
[02:15:06.837 --> 02:15:08.278]  Thanks Alex, it's great to be on.
[02:15:09.039 --> 02:15:10.520]  I've got to just clarify this.
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:15.744]  When I'm speaking on this, I'm saying this, I've been asked to say this is my opinion.
[02:15:16.024 --> 02:15:21.528]  We're going to take these things back to our members and make sure that's fully recognised by them.
[02:15:22.169 --> 02:15:33.718]  Because a lot of people wanted to distance themselves and I've discussed it with the Victorian Trades All Council and my own union, the Maritime Union, and I'm letting everyone know that it's my, these are my statements.
[02:15:34.651 --> 02:15:44.796]  They were begun out of resolutions from our union and it was taken to Trades Hall and it was a resolution that was passed that said we condemn the terrorist attacks, tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
[02:15:45.836 --> 02:15:54.860]  They've been used to start two pre-emptive wars and attacks on civil liberties and our legal principles which have been the cornerstone of civilised communities.
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:16:03.164]  There's an urgent need to go back and reassess the way we view the world after September 11 and we call for another proper independent inquiry
[02:16:03.943 --> 02:16:06.464]  So that means your members have basically voted for that.
[02:16:06.484 --> 02:16:07.885]  You're speaking as an independent citizen.
[02:16:26.015 --> 02:16:36.464]  This is the group over all the major unions and they basically, then at least those that voted in the majority, they have signed, sealed and delivered and basically backed you.
[02:16:37.005 --> 02:16:37.485]  Well that was done in 2008.
[02:16:37.525 --> 02:16:38.726]  But you'd already spoken out as early as 2006, right?
[02:16:44.051 --> 02:16:44.611]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:44.951 --> 02:16:51.813]  I was a bit suspicious right from the start, and as you were talking earlier on about Obama having a terror threat, it worked for George Bush.
[02:16:51.833 --> 02:16:57.175]  He had a 20% approval rating before September 11, and after September 11, he had an 80% approval rating.
[02:16:57.915 --> 02:17:04.357]  Well, I just hope if there is another terror event, that enough people are wise enough to have a look at what's really happened.
[02:17:07.495 --> 02:17:10.496]  You talk about 50% of the public agreeing with you.
[02:17:10.576 --> 02:17:14.978]  Polls actually are showing 70% of Australians questioning the attack.
[02:17:15.158 --> 02:17:17.700]  Quantify your statement of 50% back you.
[02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:20.141]  Well, at the time, that was accurate.
[02:17:20.281 --> 02:17:24.883]  Because after that, there was a bit of a, um, it created, it went right around the world, actually.
[02:17:25.683 --> 02:17:31.386]  And, um, the Herald Sun, which is a, you know, a newspaper, yeah, put a poll out.
[02:17:31.766 --> 02:17:34.647]  Do you, um, think the comments made by Kevin Bracken are reasonable?
[02:17:36.408 --> 02:17:40.334]  76% support me and 23% say it wasn't reasonable.
[02:17:41.075 --> 02:17:48.065]  So it is a big majority of people now, but at the time when I spoke to John Fane on the phone, it was about 50-50.
[02:17:48.085 --> 02:17:48.405]  Now it's 76-23%.
[02:17:52.961 --> 02:17:53.621]  Amazing.
[02:17:55.342 --> 02:17:59.003]  Why did you as an engineer first begin to question the official story?
[02:17:59.623 --> 02:18:00.944]  Alright, I'll clarify this too.
[02:18:01.084 --> 02:18:01.884]  I'm not an engineer.
[02:18:02.084 --> 02:18:04.725]  I'm actually a dock worker who stood for a position.
[02:18:05.445 --> 02:18:09.406]  Okay, well the newspaper says you're an engineer, so I apologize.
[02:18:09.786 --> 02:18:10.807]  That's alright.
[02:18:12.847 --> 02:18:17.849]  But what happened, there was a debate about the war in Afghanistan, Australia's involvement in the war in Afghanistan.
[02:18:19.204 --> 02:18:31.312]  The day before there was a press release put out by Paul Mason, who's a structural engineer, he's been a structural engineer for 36 years, and he said you can't have a debate about Australia's involvement in Afghanistan unless you go back and have a look at September 11.
[02:18:32.012 --> 02:18:33.173]  And that was done as a press release.
[02:18:33.413 --> 02:18:39.577]  On top of that, I pressed reply to all, and I said that's right, there are many unanswered questions about September 11.
[02:18:39.977 --> 02:18:41.498]  For example, why did the
[02:18:41.818 --> 02:18:49.921]  You know, four planes hijacked for an hour and 20 minutes and no planes, no US Air Force fighters went up to intercept them, which is against their protocols.
[02:18:50.541 --> 02:18:57.843]  And then about another 10 things, and I said there's resolutions from the Victorian Tradesville Council and the Maritime Union of Australia, the Victorian branch, calling for another inquiry.
[02:18:58.945 --> 02:19:04.368]  And then John Fain sent me an email back, who's the presenter of the program, and said, will you say it on there?
[02:19:04.408 --> 02:19:06.209]  I said, yeah, just give me the time and the number to call.
[02:19:06.749 --> 02:19:10.832]  And so, you know, when I did make the phone call, he says, oh, who are you?
[02:19:11.072 --> 02:19:11.392]  Hang on.
[02:19:11.412 --> 02:19:13.233]  It was as if I'd just called out the bloke.
[02:19:15.174 --> 02:19:16.535]  So being disingenuous.
[02:19:17.395 --> 02:19:19.236]  Yeah, well, I'm telling the truth.
[02:19:19.897 --> 02:19:27.061]  Um, and, you know, I have, we've had a, Richard Gage actually came out and spoke to, uh, a meeting at the Victorian Trades or Council.
[02:19:28.117 --> 02:19:36.261]  Well Kevin, hold on, we've got to take a break.
[02:19:36.281 --> 02:19:38.622]  We've got you until the end of the hour, the end of the live broadcast.
[02:19:38.642 --> 02:19:40.062]  We really appreciate you coming on.
[02:19:40.762 --> 02:19:41.723]  And of course, breaking news.
[02:19:41.783 --> 02:19:47.205]  I'm sorry for getting you on five minutes late, but I had to cover this breaking news with the President issuing these fake terror alerts.
[02:19:47.565 --> 02:19:56.089]  We're going to go over what Richard Gage said, what your union's saying, what the views of Australians you talk to are, and how they tried to intimidate you into silence.
[02:19:57.009 --> 02:19:58.350]  Uh, we appreciate your courage, sir.
[02:19:58.370 --> 02:19:59.470]  We're gonna come right back.
[02:19:59.490 --> 02:20:06.194]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:06.314 --> 02:20:08.555]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.

[02:22:08.404 --> 02:22:10.686]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:10.706 --> 02:22:16.150]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:16.570 --> 02:22:22.815]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:23.235 --> 02:22:28.779]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[02:23:02.863 --> 02:23:05.165]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:23:05.405 --> 02:23:12.690]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[02:23:12.970 --> 02:23:14.291]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:23:14.431 --> 02:23:17.112]  Don reports dramatic improvements with Heart and Body Extract.
[02:23:17.192 --> 02:23:22.255]  I started taking Heart and Body Extract and within a few days I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:23:22.495 --> 02:23:27.597]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[02:23:27.757 --> 02:23:32.620]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:35.281]  Order at HBExtract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:23:35.301 --> 02:23:36.602]  That's HBExtract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:23:45.592 --> 02:23:49.994]  7th, 8th, and 9th day I saw dramatic improvements from taking Hardened Body Extract.
[02:23:50.034 --> 02:23:53.336]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Hardened Body Extract.
[02:24:05.728 --> 02:24:13.263]  Kevin Bracken, President of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the last two weeks has been one of the biggest stories in Australia, and it's been in the news here.
[02:24:14.025 --> 02:24:15.428]  As they tried to demonize him, they...
[02:24:16.448 --> 02:24:19.230]  They knew his opinion, and I talked to him during the break, he agrees.
[02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:24.515]  They wanted to politically try to score points against the political party he's affiliated with and unions.
[02:24:25.075 --> 02:24:27.918]  So they said, come on as a guest, and they acted like he just called in.
[02:24:27.938 --> 02:24:32.662]  But I said, looks to me, Kevin, like this has backfired, and he agreed.
[02:24:32.942 --> 02:24:40.228]  So in your own words, break down kind of how this unfolded, and then we'll look at 9-11 itself and the attack on your free speech.
[02:24:40.889 --> 02:24:41.790]  But please continue.
[02:24:43.246 --> 02:24:45.668]  Well, as I said, there was a debate on Afghanistan.
[02:24:45.688 --> 02:24:50.751]  There was a press release released by a structural engineer from Melbourne.
[02:24:51.491 --> 02:24:53.372]  I replied to the press release.
[02:24:55.233 --> 02:24:58.315]  John Fain emailed back to me and said, would you say it on air?
[02:24:58.655 --> 02:25:00.396]  I said, no worries, give me the number and the time.
[02:25:00.857 --> 02:25:04.319]  I started talking, and Andy's, you know, he says, oh, hang on, who are you?
[02:25:04.919 --> 02:25:05.540]  Where are you from?
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:06.960]  So, yeah.
[02:25:07.481 --> 02:25:12.784]  But actually, I stuck to what the fact is, and that is that the official story doesn't stand up to scientific scrutiny.
[02:25:13.636 --> 02:25:14.417]  And, um, yeah.
[02:25:14.897 --> 02:25:16.137]  I was ridiculed throughout that.
[02:25:16.598 --> 02:25:18.299]  The next day, I rang him back again.
[02:25:19.079 --> 02:25:21.100]  And he says, oh, I'm on the horns of a dilemma here.
[02:25:21.220 --> 02:25:22.801]  He says, yesterday a man rang up.
[02:25:23.361 --> 02:25:27.724]  He later identified himself as the President of the Victorian Trades or Council of the Secretary of the Maritime Union.
[02:25:28.124 --> 02:25:29.765]  He came out with outrageous statements.
[02:25:29.945 --> 02:25:34.788]  He's been ridiculed all over the world, including in the Parliament by the Prime Minister.
[02:25:35.308 --> 02:25:37.289]  And he's come on for another whacking around the ears.
[02:25:38.401 --> 02:25:41.804]  I said, well first of all, John, I want to thank you for inviting me on the program.
[02:25:42.204 --> 02:25:43.225]  He goes, I didn't invite you on.
[02:25:43.265 --> 02:25:43.966]  I said, yes you did.
[02:25:44.026 --> 02:25:45.327]  I said, I put out a press release.
[02:25:45.347 --> 02:25:46.147]  You replied back to me.
[02:25:46.167 --> 02:25:46.968]  I've got the email.
[02:25:47.088 --> 02:25:48.529]  Give me the number and the time to ring back.
[02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:51.872]  And it said exactly who I was on the email.
[02:25:53.113 --> 02:25:57.236]  So yeah, I was quite happy with the way it went out.
[02:25:57.716 --> 02:26:07.724]  And as I said later on, earlier on, there is 76% of the people in the poll that was taken by the right wing newspaper here supporting what I said.
[02:26:09.383 --> 02:26:10.585]  And they don't like that, do they?
[02:26:19.406 --> 02:26:26.371]  And I've had, you know, tremendous support from people I've seen and I've been flooded with emails, you know, with people saying, you know, congratulations for speaking up.
[02:26:27.111 --> 02:26:28.912]  But I've sort of been on it for a long time.
[02:26:50.547 --> 02:27:02.575]  Richard Gage gave a presentation at the Victorian Trades Oil Council and told us all about exactly the science behind 9-11 so it was very convincing.
[02:27:04.557 --> 02:27:16.966]  So we've been distributing his blueprint for truth and he's had the support of a number of structural engineers from Melbourne.
[02:27:18.791 --> 02:27:22.352]  On the back of that, we replied, and I sent out the press release.
[02:27:23.253 --> 02:27:27.854]  So, but if you have a look at it, there was, and some of the emails I've got back have been fantastic.
[02:27:28.034 --> 02:27:32.116]  They're estimating that there's been 8 million people killed because of September 11th now.
[02:27:32.916 --> 02:27:47.381]  You know, there was a 3,000, you know, nearly 3,000 originally, you know, but there's all the people from Iraq, Afghanistan, there's all the people that have been killed through the, um, the flooding of opium, you know, since, you know, the, um,
[02:27:48.351 --> 02:27:56.053]  America and Australia had invaded Afghanistan, where they'd stopped the production of opium, and now the places are washed with it.
[02:27:57.514 --> 02:28:00.635]  So, unless we actually speak up about it, this is going to keep going on.
[02:28:00.955 --> 02:28:06.697]  And they've already said, if you read that blueprint for the Project for a New American Century, the wars will not end in our lifetime.
[02:28:07.097 --> 02:28:09.738]  You know, the attacks on civil liberties have started.
[02:28:10.318 --> 02:28:13.679]  But they didn't actually start with September 11th, we actually had them before.
[02:28:14.597 --> 02:28:21.320]  We had the Olympic Games in Melbourne the year before September 11th, and there was shoot to kill legislation come in.
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.881]  That was going to have a three year sunset clause, and guess what?
[02:28:24.901 --> 02:28:26.682]  It's still in, in this country.
[02:28:27.462 --> 02:28:30.023]  So, you know, it wasn't the start of it.
[02:28:30.483 --> 02:28:34.665]  These things were happening before, but it's a catalyst for the acceleration of it, you know?
[02:28:35.025 --> 02:28:41.888]  We've got ridiculous laws in this country now, which actually state that people can be charged for possession of a thing.
[02:28:43.712 --> 02:28:51.415]  Well, I remember the shoot to kill orders and now they're still... I see headlines out of Australia where it says, protesters can be shot for no reason.
[02:28:52.015 --> 02:28:54.156]  I mean, they just say if they want to kill you, they can just shoot you.
[02:28:54.716 --> 02:28:58.737]  That's right, and they can't... there's no... they can't be charged with anything.
[02:28:58.777 --> 02:29:03.719]  If they order the police or the army to shoot our own citizens, they cannot be charged.
[02:29:04.199 --> 02:29:09.061]  That was only... it was said, I'll just bring it in for the... for the Olympic Games.
[02:29:10.305 --> 02:29:24.357]  But actually, if I can just say something about this, Alex, is that one year before September 11, there was a World Economic Forum in Melbourne, and there was a protest that was organised that was called the S11 protest, and it was on September 11, 2000.
[02:29:31.709 --> 02:29:32.209]  Stay there.
[02:29:32.329 --> 02:29:32.709]  Stay there.
[02:29:32.749 --> 02:29:33.870]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:33.890 --> 02:29:35.311]  You won't be interrupted for 18 minutes.
[02:29:35.851 --> 02:29:46.617]  On the other side, let's continue there and cover the other issues of the attack on free speech and your ideas for going forward to get a new independent investigation.
[02:29:46.957 --> 02:29:47.557]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:49.778 --> 02:29:50.679]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.179 --> 02:29:52.780]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.700 --> 02:29:56.382]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.035 --> 02:30:02.456]  Hello from eFoods Direct.
[02:30:02.736 --> 02:30:07.299]  The end of October is around the corner and there's no shortage of frightening news these days.
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:18.767]  Global financial meltdown, saber rattling with Iran and other nations, worldwide drought and food shortages, more than 40 million Americans on food stamps and tens of millions unemployed.
[02:30:19.028 --> 02:30:26.793]  Have eFoods Direct help ease your fears this fall season with free shipping on all orders placed between now and November 1st.
[02:30:27.173 --> 02:30:29.735]  Every dollar you spend will buy food and eFoods
[02:30:29.795 --> 02:30:30.075]  I think so.
[02:31:00.998 --> 02:31:02.479]  We're subject to other police action.
[02:31:03.299 --> 02:31:04.220]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:08.143]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:08.443 --> 02:31:10.704]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:10.724 --> 02:31:16.168]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:16.588 --> 02:31:22.852]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:23.252 --> 02:31:28.794]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:29.235 --> 02:31:32.896]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:33.416 --> 02:31:37.418]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:37.698 --> 02:31:43.220]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:46.782]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:47.202 --> 02:31:48.642]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:49.183 --> 02:31:49.623]  It's here.

[02:32:00.831 --> 02:32:04.452]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:04.792 --> 02:32:12.913]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:32:13.653 --> 02:32:17.694]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:32:18.274 --> 02:32:29.096]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:32:29.736 --> 02:32:38.738]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:39.238 --> 02:32:44.299]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:51.841]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:52.161 --> 02:32:54.902]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:33:05.771 --> 02:33:16.662]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:33:20.887 --> 02:33:23.489]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:31.590]  Figured I'd have a little bit of Australian rock and roll music introduce this segment.
[02:33:32.351 --> 02:33:34.131]  Our guest joins us from Australia.
[02:33:34.892 --> 02:33:39.093]  In the future, it's already Saturday morning, 5.30 in the morning, where he joins us from.
[02:33:39.113 --> 02:33:44.595]  We appreciate Kevin Bracken, President of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, for joining us.
[02:33:44.675 --> 02:33:45.755]  They tried to demonize him.
[02:33:45.775 --> 02:33:47.116]  They tried to make him apologize.
[02:33:47.156 --> 02:33:50.037]  He said, no, you cowards don't set the agenda.
[02:33:50.885 --> 02:33:51.105]  And it's
[02:34:09.797 --> 02:34:15.460]  That he was just making about an event the year before on 9-11 in Australia, and how all this is used for a police state.
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:16.460]  But you heard the intro.
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:18.701]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:34:18.981 --> 02:34:19.882]  We all want liberty.
[02:34:19.942 --> 02:34:20.802]  We all want freedom.
[02:34:20.822 --> 02:34:25.104]  We all want to be able to not live under corruption and terror.
[02:34:25.204 --> 02:34:26.605]  Staged terror is being used to do it.
[02:34:26.645 --> 02:34:36.290]  Now, I wasn't going to do this today, but because Obama has been caught issuing a fake terror alert, Watson is doing an article that will be out in the next 10 minutes at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:42.015]  And just our Conway corruption search earlier this week went number one, so did the 9-11 cover-up.
[02:34:42.035 --> 02:34:43.557]  That went number one, had a huge effect.
[02:34:43.998 --> 02:34:44.878]  You can do it, folks.
[02:34:44.898 --> 02:34:46.781]  We're doing it in the last 30 minutes, but I know you can do it.
[02:34:46.841 --> 02:34:54.189]  Search it now, put it in Google over and over and over again, and keep hitting enter, enter, enter, and click on Watson Story and send it out to everyone you know.
[02:34:54.549 --> 02:34:56.631]  Two words, fake terror.
[02:34:57.412 --> 02:35:02.754]  That's going to be in our headline, Obama Issues Fake Terror Alert Ahead of Election on Election Eve.
[02:35:03.194 --> 02:35:05.655]  I'm not sure of the exact headline, but it's going to have fake terror in it.
[02:35:06.235 --> 02:35:09.016]  Obama Issues Fake Terror on Eve of Election.
[02:35:09.336 --> 02:35:14.058]  That article is coming out right now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:14.418 --> 02:35:15.598]  That article is coming out.
[02:35:15.939 --> 02:35:21.180]  So we want to search the term fake terror so people understand that this was another fake event.
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:22.421]  Fake terror.
[02:35:23.041 --> 02:35:24.482]  Okay, that is the search term.
[02:35:24.542 --> 02:35:26.044]  Two words, fake terror.
[02:35:26.584 --> 02:35:29.006]  Do it on Yahoo as well, other search engines.
[02:35:29.386 --> 02:35:30.687]  Make it the number one search term.
[02:35:30.727 --> 02:35:31.768]  You guys never fail.
[02:35:32.108 --> 02:35:33.049]  Fake terror.
[02:35:33.109 --> 02:35:33.970]  Let's do it together.
[02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:38.573]  In fact, while Kevin's talking, I'm going to be entering it into Google here in front of me on my computer screen.
[02:35:38.834 --> 02:35:39.434]  Fake terror.
[02:35:39.794 --> 02:35:41.496]  Okay, Kevin, you got interrupted by the break.
[02:35:41.876 --> 02:35:43.337]  You've got the floor on that issue.
[02:35:43.397 --> 02:35:44.458]  Any other points you want to make?
[02:35:44.498 --> 02:35:45.399]  Then I've got some questions.
[02:35:46.482 --> 02:35:49.885]  Yeah, there was an S11 protest which was against the World Economic Forum.
[02:35:50.225 --> 02:35:51.707]  Now it was a very peaceful protest.
[02:35:52.047 --> 02:35:57.251]  The first day we successfully stopped nearly all the participants from getting in there.
[02:35:57.952 --> 02:36:05.238]  On the second day they put pressure on the Victorian Government and they said to go ahead and give them the green light to attack the protesters.
[02:36:06.519 --> 02:36:12.865]  So, yeah, there was attacks on them and since then they've been paid compensation because it was illegally done.
[02:36:15.296 --> 02:36:20.959]  It was just, when it happened on September 11th, you know, the next year, you know, it just, I thought, this is strange.
[02:36:21.179 --> 02:36:34.545]  So, we started going through and there was a timeline, you know, about a month later, starting to get put together about troop movements, you know, before Afghanistan, and how those, you know, those pre-positions before September 11th actually happened, and it had become suspicious.
[02:36:34.605 --> 02:36:39.028]  And I started emailing information around to people, and, um, anyway, I sent it around.
[02:36:39.188 --> 02:36:41.449]  Next thing I pressed on, I thought, I'll have a look and see what I've sent out.
[02:36:42.282 --> 02:36:44.964]  When I pressed it, all this pornography started coming up.
[02:36:45.485 --> 02:36:56.974]  And so I actually, you know, I got sent, stopped, actually stopped doing it for a while because I thought, jeez, I don't want that to go out, you know, as if, as if, um, you know, it's stuff I've never ever looked at, I don't, I just, I don't do it.
[02:36:57.775 --> 02:37:00.137]  But, yeah, I thought, jeez, I'm not going to send out this.
[02:37:00.697 --> 02:37:04.060]  So I was shut down, you know, from actually sharing the information around.
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.423]  And it's been, there's a number of ways that, you know, people use it, of shutting people down.
[02:37:08.724 --> 02:37:08.864]  So,
[02:37:09.768 --> 02:37:13.629]  The good thing is, I'm so happy that this story's actually got out now.
[02:37:13.689 --> 02:37:19.090]  People are listening to it and starting to ask questions for themselves.
[02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:27.332]  Now, other points, other issues that you want to talk about before I get to my questions.
[02:37:32.805 --> 02:37:38.988]  It's not only, it's so far reaching, the effects that the September 11th has had on our place.
[02:37:39.368 --> 02:37:43.110]  For a start, at Outward, going to work on the wharf now is like going to prison.
[02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:48.473]  You've got to swipe for cards, you've got to have a maritime security identity card.
[02:37:48.493 --> 02:37:56.597]  If you don't get, if you haven't got a maritime security identity card, you can't work on the wharf, you can't go work on a ship, you can't work in the offshore oil and gas industry.
[02:37:57.451 --> 02:38:02.525]  Um, you know, it's so far, because seafarers, you know, from overseas are actually in there.
[02:38:02.726 --> 02:38:03.749]  They wouldn't know where they're from.
[02:38:04.952 --> 02:38:11.013]  So, they've just introduced another 190 crimes which are going to stop people from having an MC card.
[02:38:12.234 --> 02:38:16.895]  I was about to say, it's the same model worldwide with this cashless grid.
[02:38:17.155 --> 02:38:25.176]  They're now saying if you have bad credit, they're not going to let you have a security clearance and they're going to basically make almost all jobs be under this infrastructure protection.
[02:38:25.516 --> 02:38:29.417]  So this is a new form of tyranny to decide who can have jobs and who can't.
[02:38:29.957 --> 02:38:30.637]  Exactly right.
[02:38:31.198 --> 02:38:32.658]  First of all, it starts about terror.
[02:38:34.085 --> 02:38:39.349]  We've got legislation in this country with the Australian Building Control Commission, which actually is similar.
[02:38:39.850 --> 02:38:48.477]  If people no longer have the right to remain silent, if they're brought up and they work on a building site, if they don't tell the Australian Building Control Commission,
[02:38:49.355 --> 02:38:51.658]  Then they actually face a six-month jail term.
[02:38:52.178 --> 02:38:55.982]  So it actually takes away from you the right to remain silent in this country.
[02:38:56.523 --> 02:39:02.930]  So it starts off, first it's against terrorism, then it's against building workers, then it's against bikey gangs, then it's against the next thing.
[02:39:03.511 --> 02:39:07.115]  They'll say, why do we let criminals go out like this?
[02:39:07.788 --> 02:39:10.430]  So everyone will be guilty without even being charged.
[02:39:10.450 --> 02:39:15.915]  You know, the whole basis that you're innocent until proven guilty has been turned on end by this legislation.
[02:39:16.476 --> 02:39:20.799]  What we need to go back and have a look at is that September 11 was a crime.
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:21.920]  It was mass murder.
[02:39:22.321 --> 02:39:25.343]  Why hasn't one person been charged with that?
[02:39:26.539 --> 02:39:33.642]  And remember, if there was 19 people on those planes, there would have been at least 300 people backing up to support them.
[02:39:34.222 --> 02:39:36.723]  Why hasn't one of those persons been charged?
[02:39:37.384 --> 02:39:41.245]  And if you have a look at the 9-11 commission, it was a farce.
[02:39:43.112 --> 02:39:50.742]  And there's an urgent need to actually have another look, because if we do that, then we could probably have a look at what we're doing in Afghanistan, what we're doing in Iraq.
[02:39:51.323 --> 02:39:54.166]  That's not about liberating people, that's about corporate control.
[02:39:54.847 --> 02:39:59.453]  Innocent Australian people getting killed, the people in Afghanistan, and American people.
[02:40:00.638 --> 02:40:07.761]  If you were going to send our young people off to work and ask them to put their life on the line, you want to make sure you've got bloody good reasons for doing it.
[02:40:08.201 --> 02:40:09.542]  And that hasn't been done.
[02:40:09.822 --> 02:40:13.003]  So, yeah, a number of things can be fixed up.
[02:40:14.011 --> 02:40:18.073]  You know, if we start operating on truthful principles, then everything will be alright.
[02:40:18.413 --> 02:40:19.493]  Well, absolutely!
[02:40:19.653 --> 02:40:22.675]  If we start operating on a lie, no good's going to come of it.
[02:40:22.955 --> 02:40:27.257]  There's a real need to call for an urgent inquiry back into September 11.
[02:40:27.597 --> 02:40:31.358]  And let's find out who really did it, and let's actually bring justice to bear on them.
[02:40:31.879 --> 02:40:37.001]  And let's conduct it without fear or favour, and see wherever it takes us, you know?
[02:40:38.029 --> 02:40:46.094]  Well, very well said, and what's happening in England, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, the U.S., it doesn't matter.
[02:40:46.815 --> 02:40:54.300]  Everywhere where we get the internal documents in England, in Australia, in the United States, and law enforcement sends them to us,
[02:40:55.140 --> 02:41:02.705]  Ninety-five percent of the Homeland Security or Security Service training has nothing to do with foreign Muslims.
[02:41:03.146 --> 02:41:10.471]  It's all about gun owners, property rights activists, farms, ranches, liberty... Trade unionists.
[02:41:11.952 --> 02:41:13.133]  Pardon me?
[02:41:13.173 --> 02:41:13.613]  Trade unionists.
[02:41:14.414 --> 02:41:14.994]  Absolutely.
[02:41:15.034 --> 02:41:20.278]  What it does, it stops, you know, organising, it stops our ability to organise.
[02:41:20.298 --> 02:41:24.641]  We can't get on a job half the time now because we've got to go through the security protocols, you know?
[02:41:25.396 --> 02:41:36.387]  So it's not just, you know, it's anyone from operating independent and it's to take power away from people and actually give it to, you know, big business and, you know, corporations and government.
[02:41:36.852 --> 02:41:37.372]  Absolutely.
[02:41:37.412 --> 02:41:43.054]  It's their pretext to take over society, and it's aimed at anyone who wants to be independent and free.
[02:41:43.114 --> 02:41:50.136]  This is the shadowy terror enemy that can never be defeated, never can be identified, and now they're saying here in the U.S.
[02:41:50.556 --> 02:41:55.038]  it's gun owners, it's returning veterans, it's people that are against big government.
[02:41:55.498 --> 02:41:59.141]  It's people that are against police state, that we're the number one terror threat.
[02:41:59.541 --> 02:42:03.424]  I mean, this is so transparent, so people say, oh, 9-11's nine years ago.
[02:42:03.704 --> 02:42:04.425]  Why do you care?
[02:42:04.665 --> 02:42:12.431]  Because 9-11 has been used as the foundational event to totally take our free societies and turn them into nightmare police states.
[02:42:14.312 --> 02:42:14.953]  Exactly right.
[02:42:14.973 --> 02:42:19.516]  So, you know, unless we keep going along with this, you know, it's going to get worse and worse.
[02:42:19.536 --> 02:42:21.378]  So, Mussolini,
[02:42:22.228 --> 02:42:24.931]  He said, um, he was supposed to be the first fascist young leader.
[02:42:25.211 --> 02:42:28.874]  He said, I prefer not to call it fascism, I prefer to call it corporatism.
[02:42:29.114 --> 02:42:31.136]  It's the merger of the state and the corporation.
[02:42:31.617 --> 02:42:32.818]  Well, have a look what's happening now.
[02:42:34.239 --> 02:42:35.260]  People have got to wake up to it.
[02:42:36.172 --> 02:42:37.553]  Well, we appreciate your courage.
[02:42:37.573 --> 02:42:41.516]  I want to get into some of my questions now, specifically for you.
[02:42:41.816 --> 02:42:56.948]  There's a quote here where you got back on his radio show with your right to respond because he'd been demonizing you, and you exposed the host, you know, because you had his email that he'd invited you on before and then acted like you just called in, just showing the deception.
[02:42:58.309 --> 02:43:02.151]  And Mr. Bracken stood by his comments and said he had the support of 50% of the community.
[02:43:02.471 --> 02:43:05.954]  He also attacked Fain, claiming he was ridiculed on yesterday's program.
[02:43:06.494 --> 02:43:07.055]  Here's your quote.
[02:43:07.375 --> 02:43:08.676]  Unfortunately, and I love it.
[02:43:09.016 --> 02:43:14.580]  Unfortunately, cowards like yourself have set the political agenda in this country for too long, said Kevin Bracken.
[02:43:15.060 --> 02:43:19.824]  I won't be cowered down to bullies like yourself.
[02:43:20.644 --> 02:43:42.523]  And the fact is, you stood up to him, you didn't care about the demonization, when the Prime Minister, here's the Sydney Morning Herald, PM blast stupid 9-11 conspiracy comment, there's quotes here by members of your Parliament calling for you to be shut up, or for you to get in trouble for your speech, and they really showed people the naked tyranny that they want to try to bring in.
[02:43:42.543 --> 02:43:44.125]  Can you speak to that?
[02:43:45.489 --> 02:43:50.751]  Yeah, well actually I'm a member of the ALP, which is a party that Julie Gillard represents.
[02:43:51.692 --> 02:43:58.195]  So, and it's not... This is about not questioning.
[02:43:58.455 --> 02:44:00.976]  In Australia, this hasn't got any oxygen at all.
[02:44:01.256 --> 02:44:04.177]  So that's why I was so happy that actually the news was coming out.
[02:44:04.578 --> 02:44:09.220]  Even though I didn't mind being ridiculed because what I'm saying is right.
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:12.101]  And actually, everyone wanted to interview me that night.
[02:44:12.944 --> 02:44:15.245]  Since then, not one person's rung up.
[02:44:15.585 --> 02:44:22.348]  When the polls started saying that they supported me, I haven't had one offer from the mainstream media to speak.
[02:44:22.608 --> 02:44:27.650]  The only time I've spoken is on a podcast, and there's a good one.
[02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:28.590]  There's John Birchall.
[02:44:28.610 --> 02:44:29.270]  He's been doing a lot.
[02:44:29.310 --> 02:44:31.351]  He's an aircraft engineer from Sydney.
[02:44:32.011 --> 02:44:38.134]  He's got visibility911.com, and there's a podcast I've done on there, and 911oz.com also.
[02:44:38.154 --> 02:44:40.294]  There's another one too.
[02:44:42.361 --> 02:44:47.705]  Which John's been very active about, and he's probably been the number one person that's kept this going too.
[02:44:47.985 --> 02:44:54.190]  So to be clear, they coaxed you onto the air, thinking they were going to be able to demonize 9-11 Truth.
[02:44:54.250 --> 02:44:55.311]  It blew up in their face.
[02:44:56.091 --> 02:44:59.414]  But for the first day or two, they didn't know that, so they were really trying to hype it.
[02:44:59.674 --> 02:45:09.842]  But as soon as they saw the public agreed with you, you know, 70-plus percent, they panicked, and they're hoping this goes away, showing the power we have in continuing to raise this issue.
[02:45:10.441 --> 02:45:12.503]  We've just got to speak up, that's all there is, you know.
[02:45:12.543 --> 02:45:15.505]  And I congratulate all the people who have done it hard over the years, you know.
[02:45:15.805 --> 02:45:18.247]  Going out on the streets, handing out the DVDs, you know.
[02:45:19.529 --> 02:45:21.250]  That work's actually taken benefit now.
[02:45:21.490 --> 02:45:23.772]  Enough people have sort of, have questioned it.
[02:45:24.313 --> 02:45:29.016]  And most of the people I see give me tremendous support and said good on you for, you know, for doing it.
[02:45:29.116 --> 02:45:31.859]  A lot of people don't believe, you know, that's what I've said.
[02:45:32.617 --> 02:45:41.061]  But what they do say is wrong, is you know, how I was just ridiculed, how not once did he engage in any debate on the subject, but just tried to ridicule me.
[02:45:41.081 --> 02:45:46.364]  And that's been their modus operandi, you know, to get whatever agenda they want to get up in this country.
[02:45:46.744 --> 02:45:49.405]  There's the shock jocks, and I suppose you've got them over there in the USA.
[02:45:50.306 --> 02:45:54.387]  And, you know, they set the news agenda for the day in the country, you know.
[02:45:54.748 --> 02:45:58.650]  Whatever they... people, unfortunately, don't think for themselves, you know.
[02:45:58.970 --> 02:45:59.310]  As I said,
[02:46:00.063 --> 02:46:03.807]  People are being treated like sheep, but that doesn't mean you have to actually behave like sheep.
[02:46:04.267 --> 02:46:12.376]  We've got our own, you know, our own reason, you know, and we have to use those powers of reason, you know, to find out, you know, what's really going on.
[02:46:12.876 --> 02:46:16.200]  Because the picture we're being painted now isn't actually the way the world operates.
[02:46:16.570 --> 02:46:23.136]  Yes, but Kevin, you know, 70 plus percent agreeing with you in this major poll and in other polls, the vast majority.
[02:46:23.677 --> 02:46:30.664]  It shows, though, that really people aren't cheap, except they still feel like they're the minority or alone when we are the majority.
[02:46:30.704 --> 02:46:31.545]  The polls show it here.
[02:46:31.585 --> 02:46:32.686]  They show it in your country.
[02:46:32.986 --> 02:46:39.853]  We're just not connecting to each other because the dominant corporate media tries to make us feel like we're isolated and on our own.
[02:46:41.235 --> 02:46:41.916]  Exactly right.
[02:46:42.476 --> 02:46:52.705]  So, yeah, I'm actually been really heartened with all the support, messages of support that I've had through emails and also just people I've met in the street too, who said, you know, good on you for speaking up.
[02:46:53.206 --> 02:46:59.251]  And I think people are wholeheartedly sick, you know, with the, we've got a two-party system in this country, which is a bit of a farce.
[02:46:59.712 --> 02:47:03.455]  You know, it's, they have policies which really aren't any different than the other one.
[02:47:04.662 --> 02:47:15.053]  You know, I think in Australia, and we've become, you know, we went over to economic rationalism in the 80s, you know, and they started, you know, closing down all these things which were set up which were actually very good.
[02:47:15.951 --> 02:47:18.292]  And my father said, I don't know why they've got to shut them down.
[02:47:18.352 --> 02:47:20.153]  I said, Dad, they've got to do it because they've got no money.
[02:47:20.414 --> 02:47:21.494]  He said, don't tell me about that.
[02:47:21.774 --> 02:47:26.837]  He said, when I grew up, kids, there was no money around for, um, there wasn't enough food for people to eat.
[02:47:27.077 --> 02:47:28.058]  Kids had no shoes.
[02:47:28.538 --> 02:47:31.200]  He said, we were like that until the Second World War started.
[02:47:31.260 --> 02:47:34.562]  When the Second World War started, 80 out of 10 people were working for the government.
[02:47:34.902 --> 02:47:37.784]  And after six years of that, we ended up one of the strongest economies in the world.
[02:47:38.104 --> 02:47:39.224]  He said, don't worry about the money.
[02:47:39.264 --> 02:47:40.305]  They find it when they want to.
[02:47:40.705 --> 02:47:41.566]  And he's exactly right.
[02:47:42.509 --> 02:47:44.931]  Now a few final questions for you.
[02:47:46.272 --> 02:47:52.277]  We've got a final segment coming up, but specifically I remember the Sydney Morning Herald headline and others a year ago.
[02:47:53.527 --> 02:47:57.110]  Australia to implement Chinese style net censorship.
[02:47:57.130 --> 02:47:58.391]  In fact, search that guys.
[02:47:58.411 --> 02:47:59.492]  I want to show people that headline.
[02:47:59.972 --> 02:48:03.355]  Australia to implement Chinese style net censorship.
[02:48:03.675 --> 02:48:07.138]  And they said, we're going to shut down tens of thousands of sites.
[02:48:07.178 --> 02:48:08.739]  You won't be able to get access to them.
[02:48:08.999 --> 02:48:10.701]  Then they tested it for about a month.
[02:48:11.061 --> 02:48:12.262]  Most people in Australia
[02:48:12.762 --> 02:48:15.545]  Couldn't get InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:15.785 --> 02:48:17.206]  People in New Zealand couldn't.
[02:48:17.506 --> 02:48:20.249]  The ISPs were doing it without the law even passing.
[02:48:20.669 --> 02:48:24.752]  But the Aussies and the Kiwis stood up and said no and they backed off.
[02:48:25.213 --> 02:48:27.695]  But that's an illustration of the attack on free speech.
[02:48:27.975 --> 02:48:29.536]  They know we're starting to get organized.
[02:48:29.597 --> 02:48:30.237]  It scares them.
[02:48:30.577 --> 02:48:34.040]  So they're trying to... They were even putting dental offices...
[02:48:35.041 --> 02:48:37.583]  on the list that people couldn't get to their website.
[02:48:38.063 --> 02:48:39.604]  Just any list they want to put you on.
[02:48:39.644 --> 02:48:46.409]  I've got a article out of New York where somebody that protested was put on the terror list.
[02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:50.032]  Somebody that took photos of cops was put on the terror list.
[02:48:50.532 --> 02:48:56.597]  So can you speak to the moves for Australian-style Chinese net censorship?
[02:48:57.793 --> 02:49:05.637]  Yeah, well, first of all, you know, they start off for, um, you know, for... They make it out like it's a good thing because, you know, they're going to stop child pornography, which is, you know, is a good thing.
[02:49:05.657 --> 02:49:07.138]  It'd be great if they shut that down.
[02:49:07.698 --> 02:49:13.401]  But once... Then they say, righto, as you said, they'll shut down sites like 9-11 Truth.
[02:49:14.201 --> 02:49:15.362]  And, um, yeah.
[02:49:16.162 --> 02:49:26.547]  Once... You can't give them the control of that because if they have got outright censorship, you know, especially on the Net, and that's one of the... This story's got out because of the Net and actually Facebook.
[02:49:26.627 --> 02:49:27.568]  I don't go on Facebook.
[02:49:28.228 --> 02:49:36.877]  But I know a lot of young people who I know have actually just, the place that this story sort of really spread, and I got support through Facebook and things like that.
[02:49:37.357 --> 02:49:48.048]  So that actually operates, it really opens up another agenda, you know, another opportunity for people to circumvent, you know, the corporate news and speak freely to each other.
[02:49:48.863 --> 02:49:52.225]  Well that's the good news is they're trying to shut people down but it's not working.
[02:50:16.348 --> 02:50:16.768]  That's right.
[02:50:16.868 --> 02:50:20.189]  And first off, you know, before they do anything, you know, they do things which are abhorrent.
[02:50:20.229 --> 02:50:22.850]  People find abhorrent, you know, and they've got it.
[02:50:23.230 --> 02:50:30.072]  But actually, they use that as an agenda, you know, to actually stop down, shut down a lot of other things too, so... Yeah.
[02:50:30.452 --> 02:50:33.213]  No, there's censorship, but the net isn't supported.
[02:50:34.093 --> 02:50:45.337]  Well... Actually, you know, this story's got out so well because we've got, you know, the internet and we have got Facebook and things like that too, even though I've never gone on Facebook because I believe it's a massive, you know, information mining exercise.
[02:50:45.976 --> 02:50:46.236]  It is.
[02:50:46.316 --> 02:50:46.957]  Sir, stay there.
[02:50:47.037 --> 02:50:49.959]  Final segment, final points from Kevin Bracken.
[02:50:49.979 --> 02:50:55.564]  We should have our Obama issues fake terror alert article up at PrisonPlanet.com in minutes.
[02:50:55.924 --> 02:50:56.865]  It's being uploaded now.
[02:50:56.965 --> 02:50:57.725]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:50:57.745 --> 02:50:58.306]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:59.659 --> 02:51:02.940]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:07.982]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:08.262 --> 02:51:14.184]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:14.424 --> 02:51:16.565]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:16.845 --> 02:51:22.827]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:22.947 --> 02:51:26.268]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:26.348 --> 02:51:28.049]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:28.209 --> 02:51:30.270]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:30.390 --> 02:51:35.071]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:35.271 --> 02:51:35.891]  Guaranteed.

[02:51:59.161 --> 02:52:04.024]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:04.124 --> 02:52:04.905]  What have we got?
[02:52:05.125 --> 02:52:07.246]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:07.566 --> 02:52:08.307]  A republic.
[02:52:08.567 --> 02:52:11.148]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:11.228 --> 02:52:13.130]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:15.391]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:15.511 --> 02:52:16.792]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:17.212 --> 02:52:18.313]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:18.513 --> 02:52:18.913]  Children?
[02:52:19.133 --> 02:52:19.914]  Our education?
[02:52:20.254 --> 02:52:20.894]  Our money?
[02:52:21.075 --> 02:52:24.717]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:25.097 --> 02:52:29.744]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:30.065 --> 02:52:30.886]  We have the facts.
[02:52:31.087 --> 02:52:32.208]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:32.248 --> 02:52:33.130]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:33.170 --> 02:52:33.991]  We have common law.
[02:52:34.051 --> 02:52:36.295]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:36.575 --> 02:52:39.279]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:40.341]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:40.441 --> 02:52:45.222]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:45.402 --> 02:52:46.763]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:46.903 --> 02:52:47.743]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:47.983 --> 02:52:54.405]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:52:58.959 --> 02:53:01.984]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:53:02.324 --> 02:53:05.949]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:53:06.250 --> 02:53:09.695]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:53:09.975 --> 02:53:14.903]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.

[02:54:08.877 --> 02:54:31.596]  In 1814 we took a little trip Along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi We took a little bacon and we took a little beans And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to run it On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico Kevin Bracken
[02:54:33.114 --> 02:54:33.899]  We look down.
[02:54:34.448 --> 02:54:40.970]  President of the Victorian Trades Hall Council with international headlines exposing the fact that 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:42.370]  The system tried to demonize him.
[02:54:42.710 --> 02:54:44.970]  They tried to talk about censoring him.
[02:54:45.051 --> 02:54:46.151]  It blew up in their face.
[02:54:46.811 --> 02:54:49.332]  And over 70% of major polls agree with him.
[02:54:49.352 --> 02:54:50.792]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[02:54:50.872 --> 02:54:52.492]  Watson's story is not up yet.
[02:54:53.412 --> 02:54:56.753]  Dealing with Obama fake terror, but the search term is fake terror.
[02:54:57.513 --> 02:54:58.174]  It is now up.
[02:54:58.754 --> 02:55:02.335]  Because all I see is Kurt Nemo's new story at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:06.135 --> 02:55:10.899]  So I don't see the article there, but we're going to find out from him in a moment.
[02:55:10.919 --> 02:55:14.101]  But search the term fake terror, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:14.882 --> 02:55:17.303]  Kevin Brackett, any other points you'd like to make here?
[02:55:17.764 --> 02:55:19.265]  I just want to salute you for what you've done.
[02:55:19.325 --> 02:55:22.507]  And you told me you are aware of InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:55:22.547 --> 02:55:23.988]  When's the first time you saw those sites?
[02:55:25.370 --> 02:55:29.152]  Probably a few years ago now.
[02:55:29.933 --> 02:55:33.656]  So, yeah, I think there was a DVD.
[02:55:34.727 --> 02:55:37.568]  And actually, from then I went on to the website.
[02:55:37.608 --> 02:55:38.228]  So, yeah.
[02:55:39.189 --> 02:55:40.349]  I saw the DVD first.
[02:55:42.350 --> 02:55:45.551]  It was a... It was dying.
[02:55:46.011 --> 02:55:46.672]  I'm just trying to think.
[02:55:46.692 --> 02:55:48.973]  What was the DVD you produced, Alex?
[02:55:49.553 --> 02:55:55.255]  Well, I produced Loose Change Final Cut, but I also put... It was after Loose Change that I saw that.
[02:55:56.681 --> 02:55:57.682]  Truth rising?
[02:55:58.123 --> 02:55:58.763]  Truth rising.
[02:55:58.863 --> 02:56:02.366]  Might have been one of them.
[02:56:02.686 --> 02:56:05.609]  It's good work of yourself that people are starting to wake up now.
[02:56:05.629 --> 02:56:07.430]  You know, what's going on, Alex.
[02:56:07.771 --> 02:56:12.995]  And I think, I don't know whether I made the point that I started speaking about earlier, about the protest.
[02:56:13.015 --> 02:56:14.656]  It was a year before September 11th.
[02:56:14.696 --> 02:56:17.699]  It was called the Atheism Protest.
[02:56:18.159 --> 02:56:22.563]  The Channel 9 reporter got an award for it and made it look like World War 3.
[02:56:22.983 --> 02:56:23.864]  Now it was totally not.
[02:56:24.542 --> 02:56:26.484]  The way it all, it was a very peaceful protest.
[02:56:26.524 --> 02:56:32.529]  The only time there was any violence was when the police, you know, bashed the, you know, broke a picket line open.
[02:56:32.749 --> 02:56:42.417]  So, they made it look like a very violent protest and any time there's people protesting about what's happened in this corporate, it's always a violent protest.
[02:56:42.457 --> 02:56:43.237]  It's a violent protest.
[02:56:43.277 --> 02:56:45.099]  There's a G20 meeting in Seoul later in November.
[02:56:48.286 --> 02:56:59.674]  Um, and that'll be, no doubt, they'll play up as violent protestors, but I'll bet, the protestors don't do any violence, it'll be the police and actually, um, army, you know, who are there, who do all the violence, and actually blame it on the other side.
[02:57:00.375 --> 02:57:04.318]  So while they keep doing that, they take the focus away with what they're actually doing in there.
[02:57:04.578 --> 02:57:11.443]  You know, they're looking at ways of sticking up the world, about turning every, every human, um, activity into a financial transaction.
[02:57:12.123 --> 02:57:14.085]  So, you know, people have got to speak up about it,
[02:57:15.168 --> 02:57:24.639]  You know, if we want a better world, you know, we've got to actually be participators in life, you know, and make sure that we don't allow these people to take things away from us.
[02:57:25.279 --> 02:57:36.692]  And we actually, you know, we can make the build a better place and we can do, you know, without weapons, without violence, without hatred, we just need to actually be informed of what's going on and actually be prepared to do something about it.
[02:57:37.014 --> 02:57:38.716]  Well, Kevin Bracken, amen to that.
[02:57:38.836 --> 02:57:41.058]  We support you and Godspeed.
[02:57:41.819 --> 02:57:44.582]  The article is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:57:44.602 --> 02:57:46.143]  The search term is fake terror.
[02:57:46.444 --> 02:57:50.428]  That will lead everyone to Obama issues fake terror alert on eve of elections.
[02:57:50.828 --> 02:57:55.073]  We'll get Paul Watson to get Kurt Nemo to post that at Infowars.com.
[02:57:55.353 --> 02:57:59.197]  We need to get this out to everyone because the White House admits they knew last night
[02:57:59.477 --> 02:58:00.839]  They tested the ink cartridge.
[02:58:00.879 --> 02:58:01.660]  It takes seconds.
[02:58:02.001 --> 02:58:03.623]  There was no explosives residue.
[02:58:03.863 --> 02:58:05.726]  But they went with this big sweep today.
[02:58:06.026 --> 02:58:08.549]  So we'll all love our government and give our rights up to it.
[02:58:08.850 --> 02:58:09.851]  But we are the government.
[02:58:09.911 --> 02:58:10.793]  We are the people.
[02:58:10.833 --> 02:58:12.154]  Search term fake terror.
[02:58:12.515 --> 02:58:14.297]  We'll put that back up on screen, the article.
[02:58:15.038 --> 02:58:16.219]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.332 --> 02:58:46.460]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:54.241]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:54.621 --> 02:58:57.642]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:57.862 --> 02:59:02.664]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:03.024 --> 02:59:08.866]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:09.046 --> 02:59:14.067]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:14.247 --> 02:59:19.969]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
