[00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:05.571]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:07.271]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:09.232]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:10.572]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:12.213]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:16.494]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:21.156]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.733]  We have a very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:36.061]  It is the 7th of December 2010 on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:38.643]  We have Ron McDonald.
[00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:49.160]  Author of the book, co-authored it with Robert Rowan, a medical doctor, they own it all, including you, by means of toxic currency.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.343]  And people kept telling me to read this book in the last year or two.
[00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:58.527]  I know quite a bit about the Federal Reserve and Fractional Reserve Banking, and I'm like, why should I read it?
[00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:02.390]  Well, I finally read it because so many listeners mailed it to me over the last year and a half.
[00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.713]  And it's got a lot of new information, very well researched, a very easy read.
[00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.054]  This is something everybody needs to have.
[00:01:09.374 --> 00:01:14.198]  We're promoting it and selling it at infowars.com by Ron McDonald and Robert Rowan.
[00:01:14.498 --> 00:01:17.080]  They own it all, including you, by means of toxic currency.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.681]  We have this book discounted at infowars.com.
[00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:24.845]  Ron McDonald's going to be joining us coming up in the second hour today.
[00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:31.049]  We also have Wayne Madsen briefly popping in on all the new WikiLeaks stuff.
[00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.390]  Obviously, Julian Assange.
[00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.215]  Has been arrested, and I'd seen some early news articles about this a few weeks ago, but now it's confirmed.
[00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:54.127]  He had consensual sex with two women, but the country that this happened in is so globalist, and they do teach at the University of Texas and all over the US that sex between a man and a woman is rape.
[00:01:54.327 --> 00:02:00.592]  Men are inherently evil, and they consensually let him have sex with them without a condom.
[00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.791]  And they kind of said, oh, you need to wear a condom.
[00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:07.714]  They were having a party that they put on for him.
[00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:08.815]  They had a party after.
[00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:16.261]  And it turns out that one of these women is confirmed right inside serious CIA operations.
[00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:22.806]  Now, I've been talking about them basically flushing their Lee Harvey Oswald down the commode.
[00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.009]  I don't think Julian Assange is a bad guy, individually.
[00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:31.193]  And I don't like to come out and talk bad about people without having serious proof.
[00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:41.164]  I myself have been the victim of people making stuff up about me and lying and exaggerating and twisting, so I don't like to bear false witness.
[00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:57.299]  But I really respect Webster Tarpley, and I respect Wayne Madsen, but I also respect Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and he's traveling today so he couldn't come on, but he had an editorial out yesterday that we posted on InfoWars.com titled, uh, the loss of
[00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:04.276]  uh... western society's uh... morals and in fact I forget the exact headline guys, will you print that for me?
[00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:05.736]  What was the headline?
[00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:10.138]  Sorry, I thought you were telling me the headline.
[00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:19.321]  The point is dealing with the fact that regardless of what you think of Julian Assange, how has the media turned all this around
[00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:23.958]  There's the headline, Western Civilization Has Shed Its Values.
[00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.502]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, published at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I tend to agree with him.
[00:03:29.803 --> 00:03:36.848]  Regardless of what you think of Julian Assange, he may be a good guy, maybe a bad guy, maybe, like most of us, a little bit in between.
[00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:46.815]  I don't sit in in judgment without absolute proof on somebody, but regardless, how has this all been twisted into being about Assange?
[00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:56.272]  Or about how horrible it is that he leaked this stuff and he needs to be executed, as Bill O'Reilly and others have been promoting.
[00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:07.084]  Instead of, wow, look at how corrupt our government is, and look at how they're paying people off and spying on folks and trying to destabilize things.
[00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:08.946]  How has it all been turned around?
[00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:20.605]  And could it be, out of the tens of thousands of different cables, that the media spun and cherry-picked the areas they wanted to focus on to then push the globalist agenda?
[00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:22.566]  This is very sophisticated.
[00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:25.047]  But there are the George Soros connections.
[00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:28.368]  That is there.
[00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:32.190]  And so I'm very suspicious of the whole thing.
[00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.231]  Also, you couldn't have scripted this better.
[00:04:36.328 --> 00:04:46.478]  To have him play the part of the victim, but then the allegations of rape and molestation then come out are completely asinine, and then there's CIA connections.
[00:04:47.218 --> 00:04:52.443]  This way he looks like Daniel Ellsberg, who actually got prosecuted as well, but then was exonerated.
[00:04:53.424 --> 00:04:55.026]  The whole thing plays like a movie.
[00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:56.547]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:58.108]  Stay with us in fullwars.com.
[00:05:02.025 --> 00:05:05.646]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:14.108]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:18.889]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:30.291]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:39.933]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:45.494]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:53.036]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:55.757]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.171]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.492 --> 00:06:09.196]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:11.639]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:17.105]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:23.753]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:29.717]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:33.819]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.342]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.622 --> 00:06:44.146]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:47.528]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.128 --> 00:06:49.569]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:50.530]  It's here.
[00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:57.685]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:03.237]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:03.718 --> 00:07:09.079]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.741]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:17.522]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[00:07:17.942 --> 00:07:24.384]  They have two holiday price packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[00:07:24.864 --> 00:07:28.167]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in 10 cans.
[00:07:28.628 --> 00:07:35.635]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy-to-fix meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy tote bags.
[00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:40.360]  Now for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.802]  You'll get free shipping on your entire order.
[00:07:43.222 --> 00:07:49.887]  Call now, 800-409-5633 or visit them at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:50.368 --> 00:07:56.133]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:06.261]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:13.296]  Silver is maintaining well above the $30 mark.
[00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:18.099]  It's trying to push up towards its $19.80 high.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:28.225]  We've got Max Keiser popping in for about 15 minutes towards the end of the last hour to continue to track what's happening on that front.
[00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:46.125]  We have Wayne Madsen coming on in the first half of the third hour to give us his latest take and research on the ongoing gigantic story of WikiLeaks and the arrest and now denial of bail of Mr. Assange.
[00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:50.370]  And we've got a researcher who's written an amazing book.
[00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.815]  Ron McDonald also co-wrote it with Robert Rowan, medical doctor.
[00:08:53.855 --> 00:09:01.124]  They own it all, including you, coming up to get into the whole monetary situation in the second hour today.
[00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:11.795]  Let me just mention the different stacks of news I have here that I'm going to cover in detail in this hour and then go back through with our guest in the second and third hour today.
[00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:16.300]  Republicans have achieved their top goal in Obama's tax cut plan.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.424]  We're going to be looking at what these tax cuts really mean.
[00:09:19.544 --> 00:09:21.185]  Overall, this is very good news.
[00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:23.787]  and shows massive grassroots pressure
[00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:57.112]  But still a band-aid I guess with a leg, spring, gouts of blood is better than nothing.
[00:09:57.512 --> 00:10:00.336]  It's at least one degree back in the right direction.
[00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:02.398]  We'll be breaking down the details of that.
[00:10:03.926 --> 00:10:09.573]  Also, Americans are outraged as Big Sis launches DHS invasion of society.
[00:10:10.194 --> 00:10:12.236]  That's the PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[00:10:12.797 --> 00:10:21.267]  Up on Infowars.com, the article gets into the fact that the Big Sis invasion of Walmart
[00:10:22.428 --> 00:10:28.149]  Is the open rollout of what Obama announced, the civilian security force.
[00:10:28.549 --> 00:10:30.049]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:32.090]  The Drudge Report is just amazing.
[00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.451]  It is the biggest single news website in the world, hands down.
[00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:43.932]  Overall ratings wise, I guess the Huffington Post has a few more visitors, but they have thousands of articles and videos a day.
[00:10:43.992 --> 00:10:45.272]  It's all fractured.
[00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.293]  It's a community there.
[00:10:48.453 --> 00:10:50.413]  Drudge is like 30, 40 articles and that's it.
[00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:59.296]  And it's almost as big as the Huffington Post, so it's just amazing the amount of coverage news gets there and how it sets the agenda.
[00:10:59.877 --> 00:11:03.579]  Now it broke at about one o'clock central that they are invading
[00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:21.086]  Wal-Mart with the telescreens as we predicted it's now happening literally shouting orders at you and The opening message is big sis telling you to spy on other shoppers, but it's gonna be now Are there illegal guns does your neighbor spank their child?
[00:11:21.106 --> 00:11:23.367]  Does someone smoke marijuana?
[00:11:23.947 --> 00:11:35.375]  Your license plates are going to be digital soon with government messages being flashed on them and people that are wanted billboards on the sides of the road are already doing this with toll-free numbers to report illegal guns and quote terrorists.
[00:11:35.935 --> 00:11:39.958]  Then the carpet cleaner, this happened to me, sees the billboard saying report illegal guns.
[00:11:40.238 --> 00:11:45.381]  They're in your house and see a gun case and call the police because they think your shotgun's illegal.
[00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:49.944]  I mean this is the total Stasi takeover of this nation.
[00:11:49.964 --> 00:11:52.345]  I want to break down all the facets of that but the point is
[00:11:53.306 --> 00:12:01.934]  I got off air yesterday, went and did some errands before I came back to the office, and then did some more errands, listened to San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, syndicated and local radio.
[00:12:02.454 --> 00:12:18.508]  All any of them were covering was the Drugs Report, who just got a press release from Big Sis about how they're going to put in 800-plus Walmarts, telescreens at the checkout counters everywhere, where you're a captive audience being bossed around by a federal government now putting telescreens out of 1984 in marketplaces.
[00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.731]  I'm going to break this down coming up later after I get into the WikiLeaks info.
[00:12:23.751 --> 00:12:25.612]  So we're going to get into the economy.
[00:12:25.632 --> 00:12:29.314]  We're going to get into silver, now surging past 30.
[00:12:29.394 --> 00:12:33.275]  Gold surging to close to its all-time high of $1,420-plus.
[00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:40.838]  And the announcements worldwide that they are going to completely basically devalue the dollar, like Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic.
[00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:56.503]  Just finishing up with the fact that I heard mainline talk show hosts saying, this is 1984, this is Stasi society, if Big Sis wants me to report something, I'll report the fact that I don't trust the government, it's out of control.
[00:12:57.083 --> 00:13:04.269]  Everything I was thinking, the points I was making yesterday, people independently were all making the exact same points.
[00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:11.055]  And I saw it on the YouTube comments on the Homeland Security video site, 99 plus percent.
[00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:12.176]  In fact, I saw no one.
[00:13:12.896 --> 00:13:16.821]  Yesterday or last night, I was obsessed with it, reading hundreds and hundreds of comments.
[00:13:17.222 --> 00:13:24.130]  No one on the official Homeland Security YouTube with her message for Walmart that's going into the Walmarts.
[00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:25.412]  Everyone!
[00:13:26.233 --> 00:13:28.536]  I say 99 because there might be one in there I missed.
[00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:38.264]  Everyone said, you're a thug, it's a takeover, this is the domestic police force, this is to make us not trust each other but see big government as our mommy and our daddy.
[00:13:38.564 --> 00:13:44.509]  Governor Ridge two years ago, or a year and a half ago, admitted that the government put out fake terror alerts.
[00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:47.291]  Why don't you protect the border, you witch?
[00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:51.314]  I mean, it was... America is starting to wake up.
[00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:54.296]  Because when I tune in,
[00:13:55.342 --> 00:13:58.804]  To Jeff Ward on 590 and it sounds like the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:59.344 --> 00:14:02.926]  And I tune into WOAI in San Antonio and it sounds like the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:07.368]  And I tune into WBAP in Dallas and it sounds like the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:15.733]  I mean I pulled in last night about 7 at home and was sitting in the car for like 30 minutes just going through the dial every show talking about it.
[00:14:16.073 --> 00:14:17.734]  Now I did hear one caller to 590.
[00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:19.535]  He could barely talk.
[00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:32.622]  Out of scores of callers calling in, ranting, sounding just like yours truly, I heard one caller call in, and the poor guy literally sounded almost like he was mentally retarded.
[00:14:33.262 --> 00:14:43.325]  And he thought, well, you know, there are a lot of people, that's how he talked, there are a lot of people in Walmart, it's the biggest retailer, and Al-Qaeda might try to hit it.
[00:14:43.405 --> 00:14:45.206]  I'm not kidding, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:45.706 --> 00:14:46.446]  I ought to call
[00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:55.226]  Thomas McDonald, who runs Ward's show, I think he gets in about now, and asked him, it was, when I heard that call, it was about...
[00:14:58.373 --> 00:14:59.293]  Five-thirty or so.
[00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.053]  He'll know the caller.
[00:15:00.073 --> 00:15:00.914]  It was the one caller.
[00:15:01.194 --> 00:15:05.034]  And he was... Because, I mean, you know, I've gotten calls from 590 before and played them here.
[00:15:05.074 --> 00:15:08.835]  I mean, you cannot underestimate the level of some people's ignorance.
[00:15:08.855 --> 00:15:11.196]  He was like, Al-Qaeda might try to hit it.
[00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:17.677]  We need these squeams in there because they're going to try to hit us inside the Walmart and we need to be safe.
[00:15:18.237 --> 00:15:20.558]  And the host was like, but the borders are wide open.
[00:15:20.578 --> 00:15:22.058]  I mean, the terrorists could hit anywhere.
[00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:23.739]  None of this is going to stop anything.
[00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:25.219]  It's going to cause a bunch of paranoia.
[00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:32.143]  No, I think it's a good idea that the, you know, because the Al Qaeda might hurt our country by blowing up Walmart.
[00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:33.723]  They might make a bomb.
[00:15:34.124 --> 00:15:37.225]  Well, yeah, an asteroid from Pluto might come kill us all tomorrow.
[00:15:37.566 --> 00:15:39.767]  Green aliens might land and eat your brain, pal.
[00:15:40.347 --> 00:15:43.649]  Leprechauns might come and put you in the oven tonight.
[00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:49.032]  I mean, it... He literally couldn't hardly talk.
[00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:56.313]  He really thinks there's Al Qaeda under the desk, trying to come up and suck blood out of his feet like a vampire.
[00:15:57.534 --> 00:16:00.054]  Now that was a medieval fable they told children.
[00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:05.775]  Keep your feet under the covers, because vampires will come up and drink blood out of your feet in the middle of the night.
[00:16:07.696 --> 00:16:09.456]  And I mean, he might as well have told the public that.
[00:16:09.476 --> 00:16:12.677]  We're putting up telescreens to warn about vampires.
[00:16:12.737 --> 00:16:14.577]  I mean, it's as real as that.
[00:16:14.597 --> 00:16:16.958]  You've got a better chance of being killed by a terrorist
[00:16:18.407 --> 00:16:24.750]  You got a better chance being killed by bees every year, over a hundred people die on average, than you do being killed by terrorists.
[00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.931]  And then every time you research terrorism, it's almost all staged and manufactured.
[00:16:30.172 --> 00:16:35.634]  But the good news is, not one comment on the official DHS, and you ought to see all the other videos.
[00:16:35.854 --> 00:16:37.635]  DHS has a YouTube channel.
[00:16:39.437 --> 00:16:41.558]  In fact, guys, will you pull it up so I can show it to people?
[00:16:41.578 --> 00:16:46.321]  It'll be the page that has the YouTube linked in our article.
[00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:48.423]  1984 arrives in America.
[00:16:48.463 --> 00:16:50.204]  It's the first video that Drudge is linked to.
[00:16:51.164 --> 00:16:52.205]  Drudge did link to us.
[00:16:52.665 --> 00:16:59.910]  We took the press release that Drudge posted, we posted it, but found the video, and then he linked to us instead of himself.
[00:17:01.425 --> 00:17:02.447]  Thanks a lot, Matt Drudge.
[00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:03.027]  You're amazing.
[00:17:03.528 --> 00:17:08.516]  I think Drudge is starting to really get on the team here in the fight against the globalists.
[00:17:08.676 --> 00:17:10.539]  Somebody's really supercharged his awakening.
[00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:11.621]  I mean, he's always been awake.
[00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:16.468]  He was awake before a lot of us were to overall big government tyranny, but just amazing.
[00:17:17.129 --> 00:17:21.011]  But they have an official, you can go to Infowars.com or the Drudge Report and click on it.
[00:17:21.031 --> 00:17:23.192]  1984 arrives in America.
[00:17:23.512 --> 00:17:31.615]  In the first video you can go to that YouTube channel and I went through scores, I mean more than 15 or so, of the DHS videos.
[00:17:32.956 --> 00:17:39.119]  And they've got a video up there where they're talking about getting rid of the 10-4 codes to totally federalize police.
[00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:43.961]  Every comment says you're federalizing, you're taking over, you're standardizing, we know what you're doing.
[00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:48.030]  You go to other videos.
[00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.691]  Every person sees right through them.
[00:17:51.132 --> 00:17:54.014]  No one agrees with you, Ceausescu!
[00:17:54.834 --> 00:17:56.495]  Blow up the handle of the site for me.
[00:17:56.515 --> 00:18:01.918]  I want to be able to tell folks who are listening on the radio, thank you, the actual YouTube address of Homeland Security.
[00:18:03.035 --> 00:18:08.220]  Again, it's a Walmart Public Service announcement, and it's U.S.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.260]  Homeland Security.
[00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:13.824]  That is the handle name, and no one agrees with it.
[00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:14.645]  In fact, scroll down.
[00:18:14.965 --> 00:18:16.066]  I haven't looked at it in a few hours.
[00:18:16.086 --> 00:18:18.088]  Let's see what the latest comments are.
[00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.911]  Blow that up for me, thank you.
[00:18:23.733 --> 00:18:24.614]  Here's what I heard.
[00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:36.414]  We are begging you all to spy on your neighbors for us because we are yet another useless bloated federal organization busy destroying our rights as American citizens under the guise of security.
[00:18:36.774 --> 00:18:47.885]  Furthermore, I would be remiss if I didn't engage in a little and point out that Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, and Mao all did the same thing we are witnessing here with DHS.
[00:18:48.956 --> 00:18:49.737]  Here's the next quote.
[00:18:50.037 --> 00:18:50.757]  War is peace.
[00:18:50.817 --> 00:18:51.638]  Freedom is slavery.
[00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:52.499]  Ignorance is strength.
[00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.160]  Welcome to 1984, boys and girls.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.782]  Here, let's go to the next comment.
[00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:58.883]  We are in trouble.
[00:18:59.204 --> 00:18:59.824]  The next comment.
[00:18:59.924 --> 00:19:02.306]  Attention, fat inbred Walmart shoppers.
[00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:07.970]  If you see anything suspicious, report it to SS officers stationed at the customer service desk.
[00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.872]  Cattle cars are waiting to take reported suspects.
[00:19:10.892 --> 00:19:12.293]  Folks, you can read for hours.
[00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:13.854]  There's thousands of comments.
[00:19:14.054 --> 00:19:15.856]  They are having comments every few seconds.
[00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:17.397]  Every one of them gets it.
[00:19:17.677 --> 00:19:19.658]  And I was clicking on all the commenters' handles.
[00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:25.562]  They're liberals, they're conservatives, they're black, they're white, they're Asian, they're European, they're Jewish, they're Japanese.
[00:19:25.983 --> 00:19:27.984]  No one, no one buys it.
[00:19:28.304 --> 00:19:34.068]  But this arrogant lunatic thinks they can come out and go, we are putting telescreens in there to watch you.
[00:19:34.468 --> 00:19:37.510]  Yes, we are going to have your title on your neighbors.
[00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.231]  It is freedom.
[00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:40.412]  We are going to stick our hands down your pants.
[00:19:40.933 --> 00:19:42.634]  Make no mistake, they are going to put
[00:19:43.274 --> 00:19:45.555]  Civilian corps in all the shops.
[00:19:45.595 --> 00:19:46.275]  They've already said it.
[00:19:46.716 --> 00:19:47.536]  I've been telling you this.
[00:19:47.576 --> 00:19:49.917]  It's in police state for the rise of FEMA.
[00:19:51.377 --> 00:19:54.159]  They don't care though if you know they're a bunch of crooks.
[00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:56.320]  They want to get tyranny out in the open.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.320]  Because they don't care.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.500]  They're going to try to enforce it.
[00:19:58.681 --> 00:19:59.261]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.641]  Who is Sam Andy?
[00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:04.322]  Sam Andy Foods is life insurance in a can.
[00:20:04.502 --> 00:20:05.983]  Life insurance you can eat.
[00:20:06.143 --> 00:20:10.485]  Sam Andy Foods has been serving loyal customers worldwide for over 50 years.
[00:20:10.665 --> 00:20:11.386]  Why so long?
[00:20:11.726 --> 00:20:12.086]  Simple.
[00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:15.928]  Sam Andy Foods have perfected the taste and quality of low-moisture foods.
[00:20:16.088 --> 00:20:18.549]  Foods that last 15 to 25 years.
[00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:23.492]  And that's made us an industry leader among families, sportsmen, outdoorsmen, churches, schools,
[00:20:23.632 --> 00:20:25.413]  People living in remote areas, U.S.
[00:20:25.473 --> 00:20:27.354]  troops in wartime, and many others.
[00:20:27.615 --> 00:20:35.420]  Sam Andy is America's leading supplier of over 100 high-quality, low-moisture products and everything you need to survive in any emergency.

[00:20:42.704 --> 00:20:47.047]  That's SamAndy.com, just like it sounds, SamAndy.com.
[00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:50.049]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:05.117 --> 00:21:05.858]  What have we got?
[00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:08.220]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.261]  A republic.
[00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:12.123]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:21:12.183 --> 00:21:14.105]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:21:14.446 --> 00:21:16.347]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:21:16.467 --> 00:21:17.749]  So they think they own our land?
[00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:19.270]  They think they own our water?
[00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.871]  Children?
[00:21:20.091 --> 00:21:20.871]  Our education?
[00:21:21.192 --> 00:21:21.852]  Our money?
[00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:25.676]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:29.700]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.702]  You are being warned.
[00:21:31.002 --> 00:21:31.843]  We have the facts.
[00:21:32.043 --> 00:21:33.164]  We have the Constitution.
[00:21:33.204 --> 00:21:34.086]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:34.947]  We have common law.
[00:21:34.987 --> 00:21:37.249]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.294]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:21:41.394 --> 00:21:46.196]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:47.716]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:48.677]  Don't tread on me.
[00:21:48.937 --> 00:21:55.800]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:06.076]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.536 --> 00:22:14.300]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:22.524]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:22.805 --> 00:22:27.567]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.887 --> 00:22:32.591]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.111 --> 00:22:36.974]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:37.475 --> 00:22:38.475]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:38.555 --> 00:22:42.639]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:47.442]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:47.963 --> 00:22:50.485]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:50.945 --> 00:22:52.668]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.688 --> 00:22:52.948]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.468 --> 00:23:02.509]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:10.231]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[00:23:10.732 --> 00:23:14.753]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[00:23:15.273 --> 00:23:16.333]  It is glutathione.
[00:23:16.733 --> 00:23:20.375]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[00:23:20.795 --> 00:23:24.156]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[00:23:24.776 --> 00:23:30.101]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:37.307]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[00:23:37.828 --> 00:23:42.672]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[00:23:44.253 --> 00:23:46.314]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:47.034]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:23:47.074 --> 00:23:47.254]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:23:47.274 --> 00:23:48.395]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[00:23:48.415 --> 00:23:49.115]  That's OneWorldWhey.com.
[00:24:13.297 --> 00:24:28.574]  Yeah, I said I would get into the whole 1984 arrives in America scenario with the telescreens, and I will do that before the hour ends, but I basically already started ranting about it.
[00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:41.057]  The good news is, there is almost a 100% revulsion and disgust with this, and almost no one is going to buy it.
[00:24:41.477 --> 00:24:57.105]  But see, the globalists admit that they're trying to shock us, putting their hands down our pants, body scanning us, making people remove colostomy bags, making women remove prosthetic breasts who've had them amputated with mastectomies.
[00:24:58.373 --> 00:25:00.916]  Making people raise their dresses in public.
[00:25:01.516 --> 00:25:03.238]  They know it's outrageous.
[00:25:03.298 --> 00:25:04.820]  They're breaking your will.
[00:25:05.261 --> 00:25:06.822]  And they don't care if it freaks you out.
[00:25:07.183 --> 00:25:08.764]  It's meant to freak you out.
[00:25:09.185 --> 00:25:12.448]  The public reason we're told this is being done is because they want to keep us safe.
[00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:17.354]  But it's about making us not trust each other for the dumbed-down population.
[00:25:19.261 --> 00:25:24.584]  But for everybody else, it's meant to make us paranoid of government and go, whoa, we are in a tyranny.
[00:25:24.904 --> 00:25:26.365]  Whoa, they do have secret police.
[00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.606]  I better shut up and go along.
[00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:35.850]  So then we'll be angry about it, but expect it to happen that, oh, now there's citizen spies.
[00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:36.891]  Now there's InfraGard.
[00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:38.212]  Now there's clergy response team.
[00:25:38.632 --> 00:25:39.392]  Now there's the...
[00:25:40.509 --> 00:25:41.130]  Boy Scouts.
[00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:51.318]  I remember four years ago it started coming out that the Boy Scouts in mainstream news are training for door-to-door gun confiscation, the Explorer Scouts, and to quote, take on disgruntled veterans.
[00:25:51.699 --> 00:25:57.444]  And they have drills with Homeland Security where they practice literally going in and killing veterans in their homes.
[00:25:58.104 --> 00:26:02.728]  New York Times writes it with a straight face, shows a photo montage.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:12.326]  How great it is, the veterans are cast as evil gun owners who are violent, but the 14-year-olds, they go in and take them out.
[00:26:13.467 --> 00:26:24.215]  That's being done under the auspices of federal funds through Secure Corps, which is a division of AmeriCorps.
[00:26:24.636 --> 00:26:26.157]  And this was going on under Bush.
[00:26:26.677 --> 00:26:28.279]  Now it's expanding under Obama.
[00:26:29.324 --> 00:26:41.332]  And so they're getting the young, dumb people, and also very poor, very ignorant blue-collar people, who can't find any other jobs, and they're throwing them in jumpsuits and giving them weapons.
[00:26:42.052 --> 00:26:45.734]  And so, now you're just seeing the emergence of this.
[00:26:45.834 --> 00:26:48.576]  Like, oh, look at those billboards telling me to watch my neighbors.
[00:26:49.116 --> 00:26:49.497]  Oh, they're
[00:26:50.157 --> 00:26:54.159]  At public high schools and junior highs and middle schools and colleges.
[00:26:54.979 --> 00:26:55.619]  It's in the news.
[00:26:55.979 --> 00:26:58.960]  We're getting emails pouring in where they're handing out.
[00:26:59.681 --> 00:27:00.921]  In fact, I had a copy of it.
[00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:02.282]  It was taken off my desk last night.
[00:27:02.302 --> 00:27:05.843]  Will you guys bring me that color printout of the, if you see something, report it.
[00:27:06.946 --> 00:27:07.446]  Or, oh, you know what?
[00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:09.888]  I gave it to Aaron last night for the video he's putting together.
[00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:10.728]  He's got the printout.
[00:27:10.768 --> 00:27:11.108]  Thank you.
[00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:16.671]  And it shows this guy looking suspiciously for terrorists in a crowd of people.
[00:27:17.152 --> 00:27:19.013]  And he looks like he's about 20 years old.
[00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:26.437]  And they're handing these out in the high schools, the colleges, and telling them, report anything suspicious to the Threat Fusion Centers.
[00:27:27.117 --> 00:27:30.559]  So now they're priming the pump with, oh, thank you, 18-year-old.
[00:27:30.619 --> 00:27:31.720]  Thank you, 15-year-old.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.921]  You reported a suspicious van.
[00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:38.675]  Would you like to work with us informing on other things?
[00:27:39.135 --> 00:27:42.636]  And now Napolitano has actually announced this.
[00:27:43.737 --> 00:27:44.637]  In fact, here's the printout.
[00:27:44.657 --> 00:27:46.718]  I'll show you a document cam shot of it.
[00:27:46.738 --> 00:27:48.939]  It says, did you see something suspicious?
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.061]  Commuting to work or grabbing some lunch?
[00:27:52.781 --> 00:27:55.863]  Then say something to local authorities to make it right.
[00:27:56.603 --> 00:27:58.144]  Report suspicious activity.
[00:27:58.424 --> 00:27:59.624]  So I'm going to give you the number.
[00:28:00.305 --> 00:28:02.246]  Let's report the dancing Israelis on 9-11.
[00:28:04.136 --> 00:28:05.758]  Let's report the NORAD stand-down.
[00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:13.806]  Let's report the fact that Cheney was in a stand-down in the bunker, according to Mr. Bonetta, the head of the Transportation Department.
[00:28:14.307 --> 00:28:16.910]  Let's report that foreign banks have stolen trillions of dollars.
[00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:25.358]  Let's report that Building 7, that we have CNN footage of CNN saying they're going to blow up Building 7, the police saying, get back, and then they blow it up.
[00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:30.123]  Let's call them and offer to email them those online video clips.
[00:28:31.104 --> 00:28:36.629]  And let's report on all the suspicious activity, the face-scanning cameras going up, all the surveillance.
[00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:47.719]  Let's report on the borders being wide open, and AP reporting that Homeland Security hired illegal aliens to build a few miles of show fence, or that when they arrest illegal aliens who've caused
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.280]  In the U.S.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.142]  and Mexico, 28,000 deaths in the last two years.
[00:28:53.783 --> 00:28:55.264]  More deaths per year than Vietnam.
[00:28:55.824 --> 00:28:58.385]  I mean, let's report that there's illegal aliens.
[00:28:58.665 --> 00:29:00.887]  You see illegal aliens running around at day labor sites?
[00:29:01.787 --> 00:29:05.089]  Or in your neighborhood, looking around, breaking into things like's happening in my neighborhood?
[00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:15.795]  Call the Threat Fusion Center and say, hey listen, I know you just want us to all spy on each other, but I want to report the MIAC and Homeland Security report that said veterans are the number one enemy of America.
[00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:19.901]  I think the government's corrupt and out of control, so I want to report your bosses.
[00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:20.081]  877-428-5324.
[00:29:20.161 --> 00:29:22.745]  In fact, maybe I should call them live on air.
[00:29:26.914 --> 00:29:28.414]  And report a criminal government.
[00:29:28.434 --> 00:29:31.575]  Maybe later I'll do that, coming up in the last hour or so.
[00:29:32.115 --> 00:29:41.678]  Maybe I should call and report suspicious activity 877-428-5324 and let them know that we're fully aware that their boss is Stage 9-11.
[00:29:41.958 --> 00:29:44.318]  We're fully aware that they've imploded the banks by design.
[00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:50.160]  We're fully aware that the government's been taken over by terrorists who wrote Operation Northwoods and staged Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.540]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.541]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:57.264]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.323]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.643 --> 00:30:05.243]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.563 --> 00:30:08.705]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.986 --> 00:30:09.526]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:14.369]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:15.170]  It's true.
[00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:20.033]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.353 --> 00:30:20.893]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.173 --> 00:30:24.455]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:28.458]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.658 --> 00:30:29.199]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.459 --> 00:30:31.821]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.221 --> 00:30:35.585]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.905 --> 00:30:36.105]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.686 --> 00:30:40.609]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.829 --> 00:30:45.594]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:16.530]  Alright, here I go.
[00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:28.178]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:30.980]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.662]  Thank you so much for joining us at the Drudge Report.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.908]  What is linked to our article 1984 arrives...
[00:33:42.617 --> 00:33:43.297]  In America.
[00:33:43.317 --> 00:33:49.700]  And that's got the video press release of Janet Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.101]  The HOMELAND.
[00:33:51.181 --> 00:33:53.462]  I mean, this is so Orwellian in every case.
[00:33:53.522 --> 00:33:55.463]  It's as if they're using the book as a handbook.
[00:33:56.443 --> 00:34:03.626]  This is all about setting up citizen spies, the TSA being at all bus terminals, train stations, highways, inside schools.
[00:34:03.826 --> 00:34:04.907]  They've announced this years ago.
[00:34:05.467 --> 00:34:15.252]  Now they're rolling out at over 800 Walmart locations, at the checkout counter, Janet Napolitano giving you messages about spying on other people's shopping.
[00:34:15.992 --> 00:34:18.133]  Training us to be spies, not to trust each other.
[00:34:19.448 --> 00:34:22.771]  This is all part of InfraGard, SecureCorp.
[00:34:23.372 --> 00:34:25.875]  It's all part of the quote, infrastructure protection.
[00:34:26.155 --> 00:34:33.963]  Meanwhile, our borders are literally wide open, especially the southern border, where there's been over 20,000, 28,000 now deaths in the last two years.
[00:34:34.403 --> 00:34:37.387]  More deaths than again per year in Vietnam, but they don't care.
[00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:38.947]  That's not the issue.
[00:34:39.308 --> 00:34:52.093]  They're here training us that basically anyone could be a terrorist, and that the government's got to have this surveillance state in place, and actual telescreens, right out of 1984, on the street corners, on the billboards.
[00:34:53.253 --> 00:34:58.796]  Take the Schwarzenegger movie, The Running Man, with billboards saying, Report Terrorist, big video billboards.
[00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:02.537]  In every dystopic book or film, this is the hallmark.
[00:35:02.597 --> 00:35:04.318]  Well, now, in Walmart,
[00:35:05.772 --> 00:35:10.558]  We've got falling prices and falling freedom and rising tyranny.
[00:35:11.078 --> 00:35:12.780]  I mean, this is out of control.
[00:35:13.061 --> 00:35:26.376]  And we have Homeland Security putting up billboards, signs, handing these out in high schools, colleges, all over the country, these sheets that say, if you see something, say something.
[00:35:27.608 --> 00:35:28.488]  As if we're idiots.
[00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:38.891]  And I was talking to one of the guys in the office who works in sound equipment and one morning was putting boxes in a truck with people and they're white guys.
[00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:40.512]  Can you imagine if they'd had brown skin?
[00:35:40.852 --> 00:35:47.154]  And a guy pulls up in a pickup truck with one of the bumper stickers that said terrorist hunting license and says, where are you going?
[00:35:47.194 --> 00:35:47.954]  What are you doing?
[00:35:47.994 --> 00:35:48.995]  What are you loading in there?
[00:35:49.015 --> 00:35:50.175]  And they said sound equipment.
[00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.620]  He goes, I'm just making sure you're not Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:58.094]  So, you've got a better chance of dying from a bee sting, over a hundred a year, die from that, than dying of terrorism.
[00:35:58.988 --> 00:36:07.217]  But they're saying spy on everybody and now we're going to have government announcements being pumped through the telescreens at Walmart and other retailers.
[00:36:07.577 --> 00:36:15.906]  And California's announced they're coming out with digital license plates that have wanted signs on it and flashes government messages.
[00:36:16.547 --> 00:36:21.211]  And now the FCC, this is out of the Hill newspaper, pushes to regulate news
[00:36:21.832 --> 00:36:26.558]  And they openly say they want to shut down talk radio and alternative media and censor the internet.
[00:36:26.738 --> 00:36:29.502]  And you're going to have to get government approval to have a talk show.
[00:36:29.542 --> 00:36:30.843]  They're just announcing it all.
[00:36:31.224 --> 00:36:32.706]  America is becoming East Germany.
[00:36:33.769 --> 00:36:36.912]  We first wrote about this months ago in June.
[00:36:37.472 --> 00:36:38.313]  Kurt Nemo did.
[00:36:38.473 --> 00:36:41.275]  FCC stealth plan to censor internet content.
[00:36:41.775 --> 00:36:42.776]  Kurt's got a new report out.
[00:36:42.936 --> 00:36:46.739]  FCC to push to sovietize broadcast media in America.
[00:36:46.759 --> 00:36:51.323]  I'm going to play a video clip of one of the top people in the FCC openly saying this.
[00:36:51.823 --> 00:36:53.224]  I mean, they're really going for broke.
[00:36:55.029 --> 00:36:59.936]  Homeland Security wants us to report on the terrorist and on who's corrupt.
[00:37:00.297 --> 00:37:02.220]  And they say, did you see something suspicious?
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.962]  Communicate to work.
[00:37:05.819 --> 00:37:06.259]  Again, it says,
[00:37:35.759 --> 00:37:40.141]  So, Homeland Security wants you to report where you think terrorism is coming from.
[00:38:00.427 --> 00:38:04.990]  Well, we have Operation Northwoods, the mainstream ABC News has covered it.
[00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:05.590]  U.S.
[00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.811]  government plan to stage 9-11 style attacks.
[00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:11.393]  We have Gulf of Tonkin admittedly being staged to get us into Vietnam.
[00:38:12.254 --> 00:38:19.138]  We have Fox News exclusive, Al-Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11, Anwar al-Awlaki.
[00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:30.802]  Maybe the first American on the CIA's killer-capture list, but he was also a lunch guest of military brass at the Pentagon within months of September 11th, hanging out with the Secretary of the Army.
[00:38:31.002 --> 00:38:38.505]  So, he was number three in Al-Qaeda at the time, he's number one under bin Laden today, he handled the underwear bomber, the Fort Hood shooter,
[00:38:40.226 --> 00:38:45.251]  He literally runs these people, but then he's always protected, and then it turns out he's working with the U.S.
[00:38:45.291 --> 00:38:47.233]  government, so they can take our rights.
[00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:49.675]  So shouldn't that be reported to Homeland Security?
[00:38:50.156 --> 00:38:58.243]  Shouldn't all the new NIST videos that have been released that show firemen talking about bombs in other buildings, or that show police saying, get back, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[00:38:59.324 --> 00:39:02.067]  Shouldn't all that be reported to Homeland Security?
[00:39:02.347 --> 00:39:03.929]  So I'm going to call this public number.
[00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:06.051]  They've got this on telescreens at Walmart.
[00:39:06.071 --> 00:39:07.933]  They're handing it out at high schools, middle schools.
[00:39:08.454 --> 00:39:09.234]  They're handing it out.
[00:39:10.328 --> 00:39:33.292]  uh... at colleges and so i'm gonna call this public number right now uh... on air we're gonna call homeland security right now and i'm gonna report to them who the real terrorist are just like i did two months before nine eleven when i said call the white house to call congress they're gonna blow up the world trade centers and blame it on their asset bin laden remember that on record well i'm gonna call them now and i'm going to report the crime here live on air go ahead start dialing them in
[00:39:34.741 --> 00:39:36.382]  Says, did you see something suspicious?
[00:39:36.602 --> 00:39:38.443]  Commuting to work or grabbing some lunch?
[00:39:38.623 --> 00:39:40.644]  Then, you know, call Homeland Security.
[00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:42.605]  This is the Threat Fusion Centers.
[00:39:43.385 --> 00:39:46.006]  Give them something to do so they can find likely spies.
[00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.871]  Give me a Doc McKenzie shot here.
[00:39:57.295 --> 00:39:57.455]  Hello?
[00:39:58.116 --> 00:40:00.218]  Hey, this is Alex Jones calling.
[00:40:00.518 --> 00:40:01.479]  Is this Homeland Security?
[00:40:01.759 --> 00:40:02.179]  It's not.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.661]  It's the FBI.
[00:40:03.841 --> 00:40:04.902]  Oh, it's the FBI.
[00:40:05.342 --> 00:40:06.843]  Same thing, you're under the Homeland Security.
[00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:08.565]  Can I help you?
[00:40:08.805 --> 00:40:12.949]  Yes, we're broadcasting worldwide and Walmart's putting in the telescreens.
[00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:18.494]  I wanted to report key information concerning the attacks of 9-11 and further attacks.
[00:40:19.445 --> 00:40:20.085]  What's your information?
[00:40:20.666 --> 00:40:27.210]  Okay, again, my name is Alex Jones, and I wanted to read to you open source material, exclusive.
[00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:31.032]  Al-Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[00:40:31.452 --> 00:40:39.077]  Anwar al-Awlaki may be the first American on the CIA's killer capture list, but he was also a lunch guest of the military brass at the Pentagon within months of 9-11.
[00:40:39.357 --> 00:40:42.419]  And this is when he was on the news as a number three in Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:43.259]  I think?
[00:41:04.224 --> 00:41:06.426]  I want to report the Pentagon and the U.S.
[00:41:06.486 --> 00:41:11.410]  government for their history of staging terror attacks, including the Gulf of Tonkin, to start the Vietnam War.
[00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.352]  I want to report Operation Northwoods.
[00:41:14.172 --> 00:41:25.622]  I want to be able to send you the newscast that were live of the police saying, get back, that the government was going to blow up Building 7 on 9-11.
[00:41:26.042 --> 00:41:29.845]  So will you take my report here, or who can I call to report who the terrorists are?
[00:41:29.865 --> 00:41:32.447]  I'll provide you with an email address.
[00:41:32.527 --> 00:41:33.088]  Hold on, please.
[00:41:35.444 --> 00:41:38.326]  And see, everybody, they want to put us on list, they want to do all this.
[00:41:38.546 --> 00:41:39.607]  Call them all the time!
[00:41:39.807 --> 00:41:41.028]  We know who the terrorists are!
[00:41:41.268 --> 00:41:49.173]  We know who ordered the FBI to stand down, and called dozens of FBI agents in Arizona, in Florida, and in Minnesota.
[00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:52.476]  Off of the terrorists.
[00:41:54.097 --> 00:41:54.677]  Are you back, sir?
[00:41:56.759 --> 00:42:00.621]  Because I'm here to report the terrorists, since they've got telescreens going in at Walmarts.
[00:42:02.743 --> 00:42:02.943]  Hello?
[00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:07.505]  Broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:07.585 --> 00:42:09.027]  I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:42:09.087 --> 00:42:13.812]  We need to get in these people's faces and let them know that we're fully aware who staged the terror attacks.
[00:42:14.573 --> 00:42:15.054]  Doesn't matter.
[00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:17.597]  Worldwide polls already show 83 percent.
[00:42:17.697 --> 00:42:19.238]  Angus and Reed, New York Times poll.
[00:42:19.479 --> 00:42:20.079]  Question the official.
[00:42:20.119 --> 00:42:20.420]  Okay, sir.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:20.820]  I'm back.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.142]  Official live, 9-11.
[00:42:22.422 --> 00:42:23.824]  Yes, can I have your name, please?
[00:42:24.244 --> 00:42:24.945]  I'm the duty agent.
[00:42:25.526 --> 00:42:26.206]  The duty agent.
[00:42:26.287 --> 00:42:30.409]  Where is this particular Threat Fusion Center located that I just happened to be dialed into?
[00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.190]  I work in Atlanta, sir.
[00:42:32.711 --> 00:42:35.793]  So this didn't geolocate to the Threat Fusion Center in Austin.
[00:42:36.313 --> 00:42:38.354]  It sent it to the FBI headquarters?
[00:42:38.374 --> 00:42:40.336]  Or is this a Threat Fusion command base?
[00:42:40.696 --> 00:42:42.557]  I don't know how you initiated your call, sir.
[00:42:42.837 --> 00:42:43.838]  I happen to be in Atlanta.
[00:42:43.858 --> 00:42:46.359]  I'll provide you with that mailing address now if you're prepared to come.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:46.920]  Yes.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.801]  In fact, guys, can I have a pen?
[00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:50.822]  I forgot to get one.
[00:42:51.463 --> 00:42:53.424]  We are going to put that mailing address out.
[00:42:53.644 --> 00:42:54.705]  Please give us the mailing address.
[00:42:55.435 --> 00:42:55.715]  P.O.
[00:42:55.755 --> 00:43:00.961]  Box 98128 in Atlanta, Georgia, and the zip code is 30359.
[00:43:01.001 --> 00:43:03.985]  Can you give that to me one more time?
[00:43:04.005 --> 00:43:04.605]  Sorry, I'm writing.
[00:43:05.106 --> 00:43:05.366]  P.O.
[00:43:05.406 --> 00:43:06.287]  Box 98128, Atlanta, Georgia, 30359.
[00:43:11.949 --> 00:43:15.891]  Sir, you've certainly heard that Ammarullah Laki is behind all the latest terror attacks.
[00:43:16.152 --> 00:43:17.032]  Do you find it interesting?
[00:43:17.052 --> 00:43:18.593]  Do you think I should have called?
[00:43:18.613 --> 00:43:19.894]  Sir, I will discuss that with you now.
[00:43:19.914 --> 00:43:22.835]  If you have any information we need to review, we would like to take a look at it.
[00:43:22.855 --> 00:43:24.136]  Just go ahead and mail it to that address.
[00:43:24.156 --> 00:43:28.158]  So everybody should mail you, Fox and AP, that the top terrorist works for the government.
[00:43:28.218 --> 00:43:28.499]  Okay.
[00:43:29.019 --> 00:43:30.280]  Maybe he's hanging out at your office.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:30.640]  Okay.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.380]  Thank you.
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.822]  I mean, hell, if he's at the Pentagon, why not be at your office?
[00:43:34.602 --> 00:43:36.003]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:39.721 --> 00:43:44.887]  Let me give you that number again for anybody out there that wants to call 877-428-5324.
[00:43:45.347 --> 00:43:49.352]  I mean, let's tell them where the terrorists are.
[00:43:49.832 --> 00:43:59.183]  Let's mail them discs with the CNN and all the other newscasts with the police going, get back, they're bringing 7 down, Silverstein saying, yeah, we gave the order to blow it up and watch it come down.
[00:43:59.203 --> 00:44:01.225]  I mean, let's send it all to them.
[00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:10.486]  But see, it's all part of a little false power trip of how, oh, they're keeping America safe.
[00:44:10.526 --> 00:44:11.367]  Give me a break.
[00:44:11.828 --> 00:44:17.114]  Oh, and they care about the veterans as the government announces they're going to take their pension funds and their health care from veterans.
[00:44:18.275 --> 00:44:20.178]  New York Times tells us what a great idea it is.
[00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:25.483]  I want to finish up with the TSA information right now.
[00:44:25.803 --> 00:44:31.307]  This video, again, is linked up on the Drudge Report right now.
[00:44:31.448 --> 00:44:34.710]  If you go to thedrudgereport.com, it's the easiest way to find it.
[00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.832]  It's already scrolled off the front page on infowars.com.
[00:44:38.393 --> 00:44:40.875]  It's tvmonitorsatcheckouts.com.
[00:44:41.295 --> 00:44:42.475]  With government message.
[00:44:42.616 --> 00:44:47.957]  You click on that, and Drudge Links to Us, and it has 1984 arrives in America.
[00:44:48.278 --> 00:45:00.642]  You can see Big Sis' message, one of thousands to come, droning and giving us orders about how much the super state loves us, and how great the economy is, and how wonderful, and the government loves us, but don't trust your neighbors.
[00:45:00.902 --> 00:45:06.444]  And under that I have the headline, Walmart invasion, part of larger DHS takeover of America.
[00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:10.366]  We're going to go ahead and roll this five minute video, then I'm going to come back and get into WikiLeaks.
[00:45:10.586 --> 00:45:11.806]  We got key intel on that.
[00:45:12.127 --> 00:45:15.928]  I'm Alex Jones, defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic!
[00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.311]  Mind control alert.
[00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:21.351]  Mind control alert.
[00:45:23.852 --> 00:45:29.195]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:45:29.215 --> 00:45:33.317]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:34.980]  Well, it's here.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.101]  1984 in America.
[00:45:37.181 --> 00:45:39.563]  This is the straw that breaks the camel's back.
[00:45:39.603 --> 00:45:43.084]  There is no doubt that we're in deep trouble as a society.
[00:45:43.605 --> 00:46:00.833]  The head of Homeland Security, Big Sis, Janet Napolitano, has now come out and announced that over 800 Walmarts in the next month are going to install telescreens at the checkout scanner with different federal orders to spy on the other people shopping.
[00:46:01.994 --> 00:46:07.076]  That's why I'm pleased that Walmart is helping to make our communities more safe and secure.
[00:46:07.916 --> 00:46:13.458]  If you see something suspicious in the parking lot or in the store, say something immediately.
[00:46:13.918 --> 00:46:19.180]  Homeland Security's putting up billboards all over the country that say if you see something suspicious, communicate it.
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.041]  Okay, well I'm going to communicate something to you, Homeland Security.
[00:46:22.361 --> 00:46:30.604]  I see it suspicious that trillions of dollars have come up missing and the private Federal Reserve won't tell Congress where it's gone and it turns out it's foreign banks and corporations.
[00:46:31.104 --> 00:46:35.068]  I find all the corruption in government that's growing out of control to be suspicious.
[00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:40.074]  No wonder you want to distract us with all your fables about terrorist boogeymen.
[00:46:40.735 --> 00:46:44.098]  For anybody who studied history, this is completely obvious.
[00:46:44.499 --> 00:46:46.401]  We are going into hardcore tyranny.
[00:46:47.369 --> 00:46:51.453]  Report suspicious activity to your local police or sheriff.
[00:46:52.054 --> 00:46:55.817]  If you need help, ask a Walmart manager for assistance.
[00:46:56.398 --> 00:46:58.620]  This is Big Brother on steroids.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:10.832]  And folks, this is not a surprise to people that have been reading our sites because Homeland Security for at least two years has been on record starting these Viper teams and checkpoints in Boston and New York City and Miami.
[00:47:11.352 --> 00:47:18.437]  Suddenly it's on the local news showing them doing the grope downs, grabbing people's genitals, patting them down on the streets of America.
[00:47:19.198 --> 00:47:20.619]  This is wrong on so many fronts.
[00:47:20.679 --> 00:47:22.120]  It's a violation of the Tenth Amendment.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:27.664]  Our Tampa police and federal government agencies are teaming up to keep your family safe.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.703]  It's the sort of security we've seen a lot of since 9-11.
[00:47:31.943 --> 00:47:33.284]  Now, here at the bus station.
[00:47:33.704 --> 00:47:39.249]  It's all part of what Homeland Security calls VIPER, for Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response.
[00:47:39.649 --> 00:47:42.872]  This way us and our partners are ready to move in at a moment's notice.
[00:47:42.932 --> 00:47:45.915]  Folks, it doesn't get any more Big Brother 1984 than this.
[00:47:47.256 --> 00:47:48.217]  But it's not going to be Big Brother.
[00:47:48.337 --> 00:47:59.463]  It literally is Big Sis when you're checking out, looking down on you, telling you to spy on people around you, injecting paranoia into the society.
[00:47:59.703 --> 00:48:03.125]  This is worse than those terror threat levels they had.
[00:48:03.145 --> 00:48:09.049]  And now the former head of Homeland Security, Ridge, has gone public saying they would issue those for political purposes.
[00:48:10.074 --> 00:48:12.876]  A vigorous, some might say dramatic, discussion ensued.
[00:48:13.477 --> 00:48:18.200]  Ashcroft strongly urged an increase in the threat level, and was supported by Rumsfeld.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.023]  There was absolutely no support for that position within our department, that's Homeland Security.
[00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:23.804]  None!
[00:48:24.244 --> 00:48:26.226]  I wondered, is this about security?
[00:48:26.906 --> 00:48:27.727]  Or politics.
[00:48:27.987 --> 00:48:32.510]  This is our nation turning into an East German Stasi society.
[00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:34.432]  And now the system doesn't care.
[00:48:34.452 --> 00:48:35.893]  I mean, Wired Magazine.
[00:48:35.993 --> 00:48:40.096]  Feds warrantlessly tracking Americans' credit cards in real time with no warrants.
[00:48:40.316 --> 00:48:41.157]  Completely illegal.
[00:48:41.397 --> 00:48:42.718]  They don't care they're announcing it.
[00:48:43.118 --> 00:48:47.521]  The Wall Street Journal comes out and says, is your video game machine watching you?
[00:48:47.761 --> 00:48:55.167]  And goes on to admit that the new Microsoft Kinect system face scans you and has microphones on board and can identify everybody in your home.
[00:48:55.427 --> 00:49:06.673]  Our culture has been so conditioned to accept Big Brother that schools in Pennsylvania and other states come right out and say, yeah, the government-issued laptops we give you, we're washing you at home when you're in bed.
[00:49:08.581 --> 00:49:11.343]  Make no mistake, this is the story of America's enslavement.
[00:49:11.443 --> 00:49:13.864]  If we will put up with this, we will go along with anything.
[00:49:14.304 --> 00:49:16.746]  And notice this is happening as the economy implodes.
[00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:30.454]  Law enforcement sent my office the Homeland Security and MIAC reports over a year and a half ago, where the government's internal documents admit 90 plus percent of Homeland Security funding is for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans.
[00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:35.737]  The big secret is, this Homeland Security system is for the American people.
[00:49:36.558 --> 00:49:42.614]  And we had all better come together and defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution or it's over for our society.
[00:49:45.962 --> 00:49:49.764]  Again, it is not my opinion that Homeland Security is already on the streets of America.
[00:49:50.064 --> 00:49:54.826]  And now they've purchased hundreds of high-powered x-ray vans driving around looking through our walls and our cars.
[00:49:55.146 --> 00:49:56.487]  That's on record in Forbes.
[00:49:57.147 --> 00:50:06.292]  They've now purchased dozens of these huge 18-wheeler tractor trailers for football games and music events where Homeland Security is going to make you march through these.
[00:50:06.752 --> 00:50:10.394]  I mean, this is total takeover of society.
[00:50:12.003 --> 00:50:26.151]  Under the Future Attribute Screening Technologies, or FAST program, the Department of Homeland Security is developing innovative physiological and behavioral screening technologies to streamline the screening process at security checkpoints.
[00:50:26.971 --> 00:50:34.756]  The mobility of the FAST demonstration laboratory allows security officials to quickly and efficiently establish security boundaries.
[00:50:35.516 --> 00:50:40.299]  Inside the screening mobile module are a suite of real-time non-invasive sensors.
[00:50:40.399 --> 00:50:42.041]  You can watch the rest of the video.
[00:50:42.121 --> 00:50:47.607]  It's titled, Walmart Invasion, Part of Larger DHS Takeover of America.
[00:50:48.027 --> 00:50:51.511]  And at the end, I talk about the fact that a boycott of Walmart is in order.
[00:50:52.472 --> 00:50:55.515]  Walmart, as I've told you for years, is an arm of Homeland Security.
[00:50:56.096 --> 00:50:57.517]  It is just like Microsoft.
[00:50:57.577 --> 00:50:58.779]  I mean, it is the government.
[00:51:01.184 --> 00:51:03.246]  Attention shoppers, please stay in line.
[00:51:03.406 --> 00:51:06.189]  You must be scanned and searched before entering the mall area.
[00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:10.833]  Attention, you must disrobe and pass through the scanner at mall security before entering the building.
[00:51:11.253 --> 00:51:16.398]  Hey, most GCN listeners know that the future of Christmas shopping may quite well be that scary.
[00:51:16.578 --> 00:51:22.223]  And while we're not there yet, as shoppers we still face terrible traffic, crazy lines, and even crazier shoppers.
[00:51:22.423 --> 00:51:23.863]  But this year can be different.
[00:51:24.183 --> 00:51:34.966]  You can still opt out of the craziness and do your shopping off the grid by going to OffTheGridChristmas.com where you'll find our new Christmas video featuring an amazing assortment of truly hard-to-get gifts.
[00:51:35.386 --> 00:51:37.607]  Gifts you simply won't find in stores.

[00:51:42.108 --> 00:51:43.349]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:46.129]  Prices have been slashed until December 15th.
[00:51:46.409 --> 00:51:47.890]  This year, opt out of the lines.
[00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:48.910]  You won't get fined.

[00:52:00.158 --> 00:52:02.480]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.782]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.862 --> 00:52:07.704]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.084 --> 00:52:12.828]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.188 --> 00:52:17.371]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.691 --> 00:52:20.012]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.032 --> 00:52:22.573]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.913 --> 00:52:25.494]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.835 --> 00:52:33.438]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.775 --> 00:52:39.019]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.159 --> 00:52:41.441]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.001 --> 00:52:45.444]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.704 --> 00:52:46.624]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.785 --> 00:52:48.085]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.105 --> 00:52:49.106]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:06.789]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:09.790]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:13.666 --> 00:54:23.973]  Look, if they can stick their hands down your pants and radiate you, they're going to put telescreens up and tell you to watch your neighbors and just acclimate everybody that this is the new freedom, while the border stays wide open.
[00:54:24.793 --> 00:54:30.758]  If they can take the death benefits of the troops and announce that they're going to cut their health care, they can take your bank account.
[00:54:32.138 --> 00:54:33.840]  They're just testing the waters right now.
[00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:39.339]  And we've got to get bold in the face of this government and realize just how criminal they are.
[00:54:39.799 --> 00:54:43.860]  They've got a bunch of useful idiots working for them, but, you know, they can go along with the corruption.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:44.960]  I'm not going along with it.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:51.401]  Now, if they can stick their hands down your pants, they're also going to try to start shutting down free speech.
[00:54:51.861 --> 00:54:58.802]  Because when you look at these Homeland Security videos on YouTube posted by Homeland Security on their channel, they're dumb enough to allow comments.
[00:54:59.103 --> 00:55:00.363]  No one agrees with them.
[00:55:00.863 --> 00:55:01.463]  Everyone.
[00:55:03.103 --> 00:55:05.823]  I'm talking 99 plus percent sees right through you.
[00:55:06.344 --> 00:55:12.225]  So you keep playing along that everybody loves Shelchesky, everybody loves Stalin, everybody loves Hitler.
[00:55:12.625 --> 00:55:12.885]  No!
[00:55:13.145 --> 00:55:13.985]  We don't like you!
[00:55:14.285 --> 00:55:15.625]  We know who you are, crooks!
[00:55:15.985 --> 00:55:16.405]  Okay?
[00:55:16.605 --> 00:55:17.125]  We're done!
[00:55:17.145 --> 00:55:18.506]  We're done!
[00:55:19.586 --> 00:55:23.227]  You've already... and look, the globalists know we're awake, so they just are robbing everything right now.
[00:55:23.447 --> 00:55:26.007]  They're trying to wreck this country as much as they can.
[00:55:27.587 --> 00:55:29.008]  Now, back to Julian Assange.
[00:55:29.148 --> 00:55:30.768]  Regardless of what you think of him,
[00:55:31.667 --> 00:55:39.813]  There's a lot of important stuff showing deception, lies, corruption, spying, destabilization in these cables.
[00:55:40.173 --> 00:55:43.576]  Sure, they represent the delusional views of the globalists.
[00:55:43.876 --> 00:55:46.358]  Sure, people in government are more brainwashed than any other group.
[00:55:46.378 --> 00:55:48.840]  So you're just seeing a reflection of that echo chamber.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:54.725]  But the fact that it is confirmed that these women, especially one of them, are directly tied into the CIA.
[00:55:54.785 --> 00:55:58.950]  We've got an article up by Paul Watson detailing it for mainstream news sources today.
[00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:07.058]  The fact that we now learn, after months of the media implying since August that he's some type of rapist and molester, that
[00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:18.561]  He had consensual sex with them but they're claiming he didn't use a condom and it turns out one of them is a feminist who writes articles about how to basically set men up and get back at them and that all sex is rape.
[00:56:18.821 --> 00:56:20.462]  That's taught at almost all universities now.
[00:56:21.123 --> 00:56:25.825]  And they take anything wholesome and good between a man and a woman who are married and turn it into something bad.
[00:56:25.845 --> 00:56:28.987]  And that's how sick this culture is.
[00:56:29.408 --> 00:56:35.091]  To divide us so men and women are isolated from each other so the globalists can corner us.
[00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:36.432]  Now,
[00:56:38.001 --> 00:56:57.186]  The first judge that got this stuff in August in Europe threw it out and literally laughed and said you had parties for him, you had parties for him after the supposed sex and you're saying because he said come on honey I don't want to wear a condom and that that that that that that is molestation and rape?
[00:56:59.106 --> 00:57:00.567]  I mean if that's the case I guess
[00:57:01.972 --> 00:57:05.133]  Most people were not celibate until they got married.
[00:57:05.553 --> 00:57:08.813]  I guess most American men and women are rapists of some type.
[00:57:09.753 --> 00:57:16.735]  I mean, I hate to talk about subjects like this, but if you never wore a condom, at one time, you're now a molester, okay?
[00:57:16.755 --> 00:57:22.656]  I mean, that's like people who are 18 who have a 17-year-old girlfriend and they go to prison for it, for statutory rape.
[00:57:22.996 --> 00:57:29.637]  But then meanwhile, DynCorp and Halliburton can be caught running giant child kidnapping rings, and they don't get in trouble, even when there's congressional hearings about it.
[00:57:30.916 --> 00:57:35.538]  But Assange turned himself in to Scotland Yard about eight hours ago.
[00:57:36.299 --> 00:57:38.260]  He was then officially arrested.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.081]  He's now in his court date right now.
[00:57:41.702 --> 00:57:43.082]  And they've denied bail.
[00:57:43.863 --> 00:57:47.545]  Julian Assange has been denied bail.
[00:57:47.585 --> 00:57:49.906]  Judge denies WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange bail.
[00:57:50.446 --> 00:57:55.249]  A British judge jailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today, ordering the leader of the secret
[00:57:56.649 --> 00:58:12.605]  Spilling website behind bars as his organization's finances came under increasing pressure So a lot of people I respect are saying this is a George Soros op and there are connections But they're clearly then burning him and he was a useful dupe to them And we've got to stand for him to be released.
[00:58:12.665 --> 00:58:16.730]  This is all trumped up We have got to get this Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:18.732]  They're trying to frame out of there
[00:58:19.795 --> 00:58:21.657]  Before they drug him up or whatever they're going to do.
[00:58:22.357 --> 00:58:24.019]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:58:24.579 --> 00:58:33.907]  And Aaron pointed out to me earlier, and I have the text of it and the Nixon tapes, but we have to cut the profanity out, where they tried this with Daniel Ellsberg saying he was a pervert.
[00:58:34.328 --> 00:58:35.529]  And turned out that wasn't true.
[00:58:36.009 --> 00:58:39.172]  So, some of our guests may be wrong about WikiLeaks.
[00:58:41.814 --> 00:58:45.637]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:53.123 --> 00:59:55.029]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:58.279]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.895 --> 01:00:09.098]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.738 --> 01:00:10.538]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.319 --> 01:00:12.239]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.522]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.062 --> 01:00:21.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.056 --> 01:00:41.077]  We've got a guest coming on to get into the Federal Reserve, the toxic money system.
[01:00:41.878 --> 01:00:46.059]  Then later towards the end of the hour, I'm going to get into the incredible news and the video clips we've got.
[01:00:46.619 --> 01:00:49.160]  FCC pushes to regulate news, draws fire.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.421]  And they're really doing it.
[01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.841]  They've been lining up their people.
[01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:54.482]  They've got their czars in place.
[01:00:55.498 --> 01:01:05.885]  They're putting telescreens in Walmart and sticking their hands down your pants to fly, and training your preachers to spy on you, and training, you know, fourteen-year-old Boy Scouts to take on vets.
[01:01:05.905 --> 01:01:07.166]  I mean, that's all in the open.
[01:01:07.486 --> 01:01:09.227]  Of course they're going to try to shut down the press.
[01:01:09.628 --> 01:01:11.509]  Everyone sees through Ceaucescu.
[01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:13.450]  Obama the puppet.
[01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:14.931]  The neocons.
[01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.132]  The system is desperate.
[01:01:16.152 --> 01:01:17.313]  They've stolen us blind.
[01:01:17.793 --> 01:01:19.074]  Now they've got to get away with it.
[01:01:20.075 --> 01:01:21.776]  So that is coming up.
[01:01:21.796 --> 01:01:24.078]  But finishing up with Julian Assange.
[01:01:25.806 --> 01:01:27.387]  I have an open mind on this.
[01:01:27.547 --> 01:01:30.510]  I've had guests on that have praised Assange in the last few years.
[01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:34.853]  Like Birgitta Jones-Dottier, who knows him.
[01:01:35.293 --> 01:01:40.137]  Assange has sent us many emails and agreed to come on many times, but then never said it.
[01:01:40.357 --> 01:01:41.538]  So I've tried to get him on.
[01:01:42.859 --> 01:01:46.602]  It's got to be more than 50 times Jaron has tried in the last year and a half to get Assange on.
[01:01:47.322 --> 01:01:48.723]  Many times, over and over again.
[01:01:48.743 --> 01:01:50.985]  He says, yeah, I'll come on next week, and he never does.
[01:01:51.045 --> 01:01:52.967]  So we've tried to give you his view.
[01:01:54.296 --> 01:02:02.082]  But I will tell you that a lot of people I respect and a lot of evidence has come out that elements of the government released the Pentagon Papers.
[01:02:03.182 --> 01:02:07.765]  They may have been good elements to get us out of the Vietnam War because they knew it was a failure.
[01:02:08.906 --> 01:02:11.328]  And some are saying that's what's happening today.
[01:02:12.509 --> 01:02:15.191]  Others are saying Assange is totally George Soros run.
[01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:21.275]  There are some connections to that, but that may be the CIA threw them to keep their friends close and their enemies even closer.
[01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:25.031]  Also, he may not know what's happening.
[01:02:25.071 --> 01:02:39.836]  They may be putting fake charges of rape on him, knowing that now that it's come out that it was consensual sex, but they're saying because there was no condom that that's now abuse, that people will see that as asinine, see it as persecution, and then buy into what's in these leaks.
[01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:46.699]  But the bigger issue is what Dr. Paul Craig Roberts pointed out in his editorial published at InfoWars.com yesterday.
[01:02:48.089 --> 01:03:07.524]  And that is, that regardless of all of that, look at the immorality and corruption that these cables show, the spying, the lying, the payoffs, all of this stuff that's also going on against the American people, and the media's acting like that's a great thing, and how dare anybody release this stuff?
[01:03:07.844 --> 01:03:13.729]  I mean, we do have this national security state operating in secret, with a license to kill, a license to steal.
[01:03:14.009 --> 01:03:14.950]  Of course we're in trouble!
[01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.253]  Of course they've traded 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives.
[01:03:18.793 --> 01:03:20.815]  Of course they got telescreens going in Walmart.
[01:03:21.816 --> 01:03:27.121]  Because you allow people to operate in secrecy with unlimited power, they're going to abuse it.
[01:03:28.601 --> 01:03:32.805]  And it's been 63 years since the National Security Act of 1947.
[01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:39.891]  And in the corruption we had then with the Federal Reserve, they got government power at that time.
[01:03:40.351 --> 01:03:55.785]  And now they've built a world empire out of it, and they've decided to go ahead and rob the golden goose, the fluoride-head goose that is the American people as we waddle around on our little duck feet, drunk from all of the entertainment and drugs pumped into our food and water supply.
[01:03:56.545 --> 01:03:58.166]  So they're moving on to China right now.
[01:03:58.687 --> 01:04:03.110]  So the fact that they've denied his bond and are now saying, now we're looking at finances.
[01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:14.398]  See, they've used this admitted CIA connection with these women, this trumped up garbage, saying you can beat the rap, you can't beat the ride.
[01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:25.206]  And Assange showed no reaction as Judge Howard Riddle denied him bail in an extradition case that could see him sent to Sweden to face the allegations of rape, molestation, and unlawful coercion.
[01:04:26.527 --> 01:04:27.208]  They had a party.
[01:04:27.608 --> 01:04:29.490]  He had sex with these women for two nights.
[01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:31.051]  Then they had another party for him.
[01:04:31.592 --> 01:04:37.977]  Assange denies the accusations and pledged to fight the extradition, while a spokesman for his organization said the U.S.
[01:04:37.998 --> 01:04:41.781]  diplomatic secrets would keep on flowing regardless of what happened to the group's founder.
[01:04:43.002 --> 01:04:45.885]  And they say if something happens to him, they're going to release the motherlode.
[01:04:45.905 --> 01:04:49.628]  But this is what I know, though.
[01:04:50.449 --> 01:04:51.330]  I know one thing.
[01:04:52.728 --> 01:04:54.330]  And I'll tell you that when we come back.
[01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:56.972]  Then we'll get into the economy and a lot more than the censorship.
[01:04:56.992 --> 01:04:57.373]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.236 --> 01:05:03.899]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:05:04.059 --> 01:05:08.102]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:05:08.342 --> 01:05:13.126]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:18.229]  Looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:22.493]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:05:22.653 --> 01:05:25.995]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:05:28.927 --> 01:05:35.773]  We're American and be proud.
[01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:38.636]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:59.373]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:05:59.893 --> 01:06:04.116]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.436 --> 01:06:08.499]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.779 --> 01:06:14.182]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.523 --> 01:06:14.983]  It's true.
[01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:19.806]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.126 --> 01:06:20.667]  Number 3.
[01:06:20.947 --> 01:06:24.230]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:28.273]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.454 --> 01:06:29.014]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.254 --> 01:06:31.616]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.017 --> 01:06:35.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:35.900]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:40.404]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:45.389]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:49.694]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.854 --> 01:06:51.416]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.636 --> 01:06:53.718]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:53.899 --> 01:06:56.221]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:00.523 --> 01:07:14.990]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:19.673]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:20.686 --> 01:07:32.696]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:33.457 --> 01:07:40.723]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:41.403 --> 01:07:51.012]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:07:51.772 --> 01:07:55.055]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:07:55.696 --> 01:07:58.899]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:05.364]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.685 --> 01:08:07.987]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:17.148 --> 01:08:21.012]  All right, for the next 40 minutes or so, then I'm getting into the open announcement.
[01:08:21.373 --> 01:08:29.722]  They now have confirmed all of our reverse-engineered reports on the different pieces we have from Cass Sunstein, the FCC, Diversity Czar.
[01:08:30.262 --> 01:08:37.610]  Now, the head of the FCC and others have said they are going to censor the internet, talk radio, internet radio, TV.
[01:08:38.992 --> 01:08:39.833]  They're very bold.
[01:08:39.873 --> 01:08:57.251]  We've had the head of one of the key committees, Senator Jay Rockefeller, say we'd be better off without the Internet, that he, quote, wants to shut down Fox News and MSNBC if they can knock off the big ones who've been in these political fights and, you know, bring this kind of East German
[01:09:00.418 --> 01:09:02.799]  You know, just dry Soviet-style news.
[01:09:03.159 --> 01:09:03.999]  They're going to do it.
[01:09:04.079 --> 01:09:04.959]  That is coming up.
[01:09:04.999 --> 01:09:06.059]  This is a big issue.
[01:09:06.379 --> 01:09:12.881]  Then we're getting into WikiLeaks and the newest developments with Wayne Madsen popping in and then Max Keiser on silver going above $30.
[01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:16.342]  They're trying to drive it down right now, but they're not successful.
[01:09:17.962 --> 01:09:18.902]  You watch the graph.
[01:09:19.202 --> 01:09:21.403]  In the last 10 years, silver and gold are going straight up.
[01:09:21.963 --> 01:09:30.868]  But if you zoom in on the graph, month to month, week to week, it might dip a little, but then it always races back up even more because of dollar devaluation globally.
[01:09:31.148 --> 01:09:37.651]  So Kaiser's popping in the last 15 minutes of the show or so today to talk about that as well.
[01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:40.772]  Very important information on that front.
[01:09:41.273 --> 01:09:51.118]  In the last year and a half, I've gotten a lot of calls saying, you've got to read, they own it all, including you, by means of toxic currency by Ron McDonald and Robert Rowan.
[01:09:53.959 --> 01:09:56.080]  I know a lot about the Federal Reserve.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.721]  I've been studying for 17 years, and I think, I don't need to read another book.
[01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:01.141]  But I finally did, and I said, well, we got to carry this.
[01:10:01.341 --> 01:10:02.402]  It's easy to understand.
[01:10:02.882 --> 01:10:08.744]  It gets in-depth into a lot of things that I was aware of, but the general public isn't, or your friends or family may not be.
[01:10:09.024 --> 01:10:11.825]  But it's really tied together well.
[01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:16.468]  So I hope people will get it.
[01:10:16.908 --> 01:10:20.029]  They own it all, including you, by means of toxic currency.
[01:10:20.609 --> 01:10:23.469]  And it's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:23.829 --> 01:10:24.670]  Discounted, by the way.
[01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:29.991]  And he has the great quote, I care not what puppet is placed in the throne of England to rule the empire.
[01:10:30.371 --> 01:10:35.551]  The man that controls Britain's money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the money supply.
[01:10:35.872 --> 01:10:40.732]  That was Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild of the Rothschild International Banking Cartel.
[01:10:41.232 --> 01:10:44.173]  And so to break down the book that I hope everybody gets, by the way,
[01:10:44.713 --> 01:10:46.394]  We got 800 of Charlotte Isserby's book.
[01:10:46.434 --> 01:10:47.314]  It's now out of print.
[01:10:48.075 --> 01:10:51.516]  And we sold out of them in less than a day.
[01:10:52.357 --> 01:10:55.278]  She said she had 100 or so more she's going to mail to us now.
[01:10:55.598 --> 01:10:56.819]  We'll have those available next week.
[01:10:56.839 --> 01:10:57.939]  And then that said, it's out of print.
[01:10:57.959 --> 01:11:01.421]  So I'm sorry that we've had to remove that from the shopping cart.
[01:11:01.901 --> 01:11:03.122]  And thank you for the support, though.
[01:11:03.142 --> 01:11:05.943]  And you've got a great book to wake people up now with the deliberate numbing down.
[01:11:06.603 --> 01:11:07.524]  It was selling everywhere else for $100, $200.
[01:11:07.624 --> 01:11:08.984]  It's out of print.
[01:11:09.385 --> 01:11:09.885]  We sold it.
[01:11:10.285 --> 01:11:12.067]  At retail, so it sold out pretty quick.
[01:11:12.647 --> 01:11:16.151]  But we'll have some signed copies next week to offer for folks.
[01:11:16.191 --> 01:11:20.194]  And again, thank you for supporting us all at InfoWars.com on the online video bookstore.
[01:11:20.895 --> 01:11:31.204]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.TV, the armory of resistance, the live video simulcast, the radio show, the archive, the higher quality audio podcast, my book, Bill Watson's book, both out of print.
[01:11:31.605 --> 01:11:35.909]  Dozens of new interviews, including an interview with the head of Skywatch on chemtrails.
[01:11:36.589 --> 01:11:40.773]  Uh, Dr. Blaylock, we got Dr. Conant coming up in the next few days, Russell Means.
[01:11:41.114 --> 01:11:46.038]  Just every week we're having three, four exclusive interviews where we fly around the country and interview people.
[01:11:46.358 --> 01:11:48.140]  We're flying to interview Charlotte Isabry next week.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.943]  I mean, we're really turning up the heat at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:53.565]  Download them, burn them to a disk.
[01:11:54.005 --> 01:11:56.007]  Every subject you can imagine, give them to people.
[01:11:56.428 --> 01:11:58.129]  Give a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:04.931]  5.95 a month, but every December for Christmas, for the holiday, you can get 5.3 months free.
[01:12:05.211 --> 01:12:08.872]  You buy a year, you pay for 6.7 months, you get 5.3 months free.
[01:12:09.772 --> 01:12:13.193]  So you get a yearly membership and get it a lot lower than 5.95 a month.
[01:12:13.653 --> 01:12:17.214]  Or you can do the trial, 5.95 a month, and that's how we're funding the operation.
[01:12:17.554 --> 01:12:23.495]  I want to commend all of you that are members, but use the site, share your username and passcode with those, you know, that you trust.
[01:12:23.775 --> 01:12:26.916]  I wouldn't use a username or passcode that, you know, gets into anything else of yours, but
[01:12:27.216 --> 01:12:29.718]  You know, we allow six people with the same username and passcode.
[01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:31.799]  You buy one membership, you basically get six.
[01:12:32.539 --> 01:12:36.342]  Six people can be simultaneously logged in under the same username and passcode.
[01:12:36.682 --> 01:12:40.064]  But again, as I've always told you, we let folks share it with a limited number of people.
[01:12:40.524 --> 01:12:42.266]  It'd be unlimited, but we can't afford the bandwidth.
[01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:46.808]  Use a username and passcode that is only for PrisonPlanet.tv if you're going to share it.
[01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:48.870]  Send it as an e-card to friends and family.
[01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:51.792]  Hey, here's a member site with all these films and books.
[01:12:52.392 --> 01:12:52.832]  Here it is.
[01:12:52.872 --> 01:12:58.033]  So give yourself a gift and give some of your family the gift of a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:12:58.333 --> 01:13:10.856]  Or if you want to support us, buy a whole bunch of memberships and create easy, you know, username and passcodes, and then give that to friends and family and say, here's your e-card or here's your physical card, here's your PrisonPlanet.tv membership, please use it.
[01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:16.218]  And a lot of folks will use it, but regardless, you'll be supporting our operation at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:18.958]  And who can deny we're at the tip of the spear and having a huge effect?
[01:13:19.378 --> 01:13:21.799]  Now, no doubt I'll have him back up again, because I'm a fan of the book,
[01:13:22.519 --> 01:13:26.041]  I haven't actually finished the whole thing, but I've read about 80% of it.
[01:13:26.061 --> 01:13:28.642]  It goes into John D. Rockefeller, you know, the whole system.
[01:13:28.682 --> 01:13:34.685]  But in this abbreviated transmission, Ron McDonald, break down what the book covers and what you've discovered.
[01:13:35.486 --> 01:13:41.869]  Well, probably the most important thing about the book is understanding the real defining of the term income.
[01:13:42.789 --> 01:13:48.532]  And what I've discovered is through a case that I had researched
[01:13:49.322 --> 01:13:58.188]  I noted, and the case is $3,976.62 in currency and one Ford 1964 station wagon.
[01:13:59.089 --> 01:14:05.153]  In that case, this property was sieged on the land in a Midwestern state.
[01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:10.957]  And what happened there is that the Internal Revenue Service got involved with that.
[01:14:11.037 --> 01:14:14.760]  And I looked for the authority of how they did that on the land.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.501]  A seizure usually is out at sea.
[01:14:17.225 --> 01:14:29.176]  And this is a quote from the case, and it says, Although, presumably, for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction, action for forfeiture under internal revenue laws is commenced as proceeding in admiralty.
[01:14:29.957 --> 01:14:34.381]  After jurisdiction is obtained, proceeding takes on character of civil action as law.
[01:14:35.742 --> 01:14:46.825]  Well, let me stop you for a moment, Ron, because your phone's okay, but it's a little low, so try to speak right in the receiver.
[01:14:47.085 --> 01:14:53.006]  But I've seen this in cases where the feds are taking people's land for literally no reason or an adverse possession.
[01:14:53.306 --> 01:14:58.628]  They will declare admiralty and they will talk about it being maritime jurisdiction or literally a
[01:14:59.608 --> 01:15:00.209]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:00.309 --> 01:15:05.754]  And the Rules of Civil Procedure, I looked up, and actually it fell under Rule C of the Admiralty Rules of Court.
[01:15:21.411 --> 01:15:25.012]  And under that rule, it says for mere maritime hypothecation.
[01:15:25.412 --> 01:15:28.773]  So that's a very big... Yeah, now that your level's perfect, start over.
[01:15:28.833 --> 01:15:30.414]  Get into what you were reading with the Admiralty.
[01:15:30.454 --> 01:15:30.874]  Go ahead.
[01:15:30.934 --> 01:15:38.756]  Okay, and from the quote from that seizure or forfeiture on the land, I quote, although presumably for the purposes...
[01:15:39.316 --> 01:15:40.537]  ...of obtaining jurisdiction.
[01:15:40.677 --> 01:15:46.041]  Action for forfeiture under internal revenue laws is commenced as proceeding in admiralty.
[01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:51.426]  After jurisdiction is obtained, proceeding takes on character of civil action at law.
[01:15:51.926 --> 01:15:56.309]  And at least at such stage of proceedings, rules of civil procedure control.
[01:15:56.329 --> 01:16:03.535]  Well, I researched the rules of civil procedure, but it led me to the actual rule, Rule C of the Admiralty Rules.
[01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:07.736]  And under that rule, it says for mere maritime hypothecation.
[01:16:08.316 --> 01:16:13.400]  Well, mere maritime hypothecation is a lien for the creditor's interest in something.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.943]  This case talked about currency and a forged station wagon.
[01:16:18.544 --> 01:16:25.189]  So, understanding how they could seize both currency and forged station wagon, they did it because there were liens on there.
[01:16:25.889 --> 01:16:29.692]  I'm going to break down what actual money is and currency is.
[01:16:30.575 --> 01:16:38.198]  Uh, the gold coin that was once the lawful coin of the realm, here in America, fell under the Mint Act of 1792.
[01:16:38.858 --> 01:16:44.520]  In that gold coin were an infinite number of qualities, inclusive of title, rights, and interest.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:54.164]  When you used that gold coin to buy something, to purchase something, the title, rights, and interest transferred from the gold coin into the very thing you purchased.
[01:16:54.604 --> 01:16:59.766]  So now you had title, rights, and interest in that thing, whether it was a table, or a house, or whatever.
[01:17:00.606 --> 01:17:04.234]  However, with the Federal Reserve note, you have a lien in there.
[01:17:04.274 --> 01:17:05.717]  That's that mere maritime hypothesis.
[01:17:05.737 --> 01:17:07.981]  And that's why the government holds the title to your car.
[01:17:08.522 --> 01:17:11.990]  Everything is basically like rented or through a feudal serf system.
[01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:13.432]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:14.112 --> 01:17:23.759]  And with that lien and the Federal Reserve note, it transfers also because that's the quality and nature of currency, whether it's gold coin or whether it's Federal Reserve notes.
[01:17:24.419 --> 01:17:35.087]  And that lien transfers into the very thing, so when you buy a table for $10 Federal Reserve note, a lien of 100% owned by the creditor travels right into that table.
[01:17:35.647 --> 01:17:38.369]  And we understand this to be true because before 1933,
[01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:44.952]  In order for the state to seize anything from you, it had to go through the courts.
[01:17:45.553 --> 01:17:47.253]  And the courts were courts of law.
[01:17:47.414 --> 01:17:52.376]  Today, if you leave your car on the side or they arrest you, they seize it immediately.
[01:17:52.416 --> 01:17:56.838]  There's no longer, are in touch with the common law courts.
[01:17:56.878 --> 01:18:00.880]  So we've lost that aspect of our society, of our liberty.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:10.063]  In 1933, this actually happened, and I'm going to disregard everything that happened up to 1933, but it started at the commencement of the country.
[01:18:10.883 --> 01:18:20.347]  In 1933, the President of the United States was given complete, unlimited control over economics in this country.
[01:18:20.427 --> 01:18:25.489]  That meant he had the right to control every aspect of the country's economy.
[01:18:26.109 --> 01:18:28.610]  And this was because they determined that
[01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:32.213]  Our competition was a scourge on society.
[01:18:32.513 --> 01:18:39.620]  That meant that to build a better mousetrap, a cheaper mousetrap, was no longer a good thing for the people.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.125]  Now they want planned economies which vertically integrate all power to the elite's hands.
[01:18:44.685 --> 01:18:45.365]  Absolutely.
[01:18:45.785 --> 01:18:55.487]  And you understand one thing about building a better mousetrap, whether it's a better car, whether it's better whatever, is that it actually increases the value of money in your pocket.
[01:18:55.507 --> 01:19:02.689]  Yeah, the overall wealth of a nation, that's why then your money, if it's fiat, has value because it's all staked on the credit and faith.
[01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:09.870]  That's the system they moved us to, but now they've debased the nation itself because they're waging war against any independent wealth.
[01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:11.933]  Oh absolutely, absolutely.
[01:19:11.973 --> 01:19:20.410]  So we were told that to compete against each other, to build better things, to increase the money value in our pocket was
[01:19:21.133 --> 01:19:24.994]  Uh, a basically a evil on our society.
[01:19:25.415 --> 01:19:31.617]  So the president was given unlimited power and you have to question, well, his office is enumerated with power.
[01:19:31.657 --> 01:19:33.518]  So where did they get this extra power?
[01:19:34.178 --> 01:19:42.821]  This is the first breach of the, not the first, but it is a breach of the federal constitution because that power had to come from the judicial and from the Congress.
[01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:43.622]  All right, Ron.
[01:19:43.762 --> 01:19:47.868]  Ron McDonald, co-author of They Own It All, Including You by Means of Toxic Currency.
[01:19:48.389 --> 01:19:49.531]  He ties it all together.
[01:19:49.571 --> 01:19:51.553]  This is beyond just fractional reserve banking.
[01:19:51.974 --> 01:19:55.018]  This is their system of fraud, the net they've caught us in.

[01:21:31.068 --> 01:21:35.451]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:35.631 --> 01:21:41.335]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:41.435 --> 01:21:44.857]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:45.077 --> 01:21:47.679]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:07.532]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:22:07.932 --> 01:22:12.675]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:13.035 --> 01:22:17.218]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:17.538 --> 01:22:19.859]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:19.879 --> 01:22:22.420]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.341]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:25.681 --> 01:22:33.284]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:33.621 --> 01:22:38.846]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:39.006 --> 01:22:41.288]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:41.328 --> 01:22:45.291]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:45.552 --> 01:22:46.453]  And I got news for you.

[01:24:18.710 --> 01:24:19.776]  I don't know.
[01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:33.771]  Okay, going back to Ron McDonald, the author of the book that... Other books have covered similar things, but not tied it all together.
[01:24:33.831 --> 01:24:34.791]  It's really a masterpiece.
[01:24:34.831 --> 01:24:35.912]  They own it all, including you.
[01:24:36.412 --> 01:24:38.093]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:38.613 --> 01:24:41.754]  It makes a great Christmas gift for your friends and family, as well, to wake them up.
[01:24:41.855 --> 01:24:45.096]  Every mind we unlock is so valuable to the overall fight for liberty.
[01:24:45.316 --> 01:24:49.438]  You were getting up to the President and this false monetary system.
[01:24:49.858 --> 01:24:50.558]  Please continue.
[01:24:51.699 --> 01:24:56.261]  In 1933 was a crucial point in the history of America because both the wealth
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:25:01.244]  And that's why they set up state police that were federally chartered and began the licensing?
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:23.920]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:25:24.201 --> 01:25:24.701]  Absolutely.
[01:25:24.761 --> 01:25:28.743]  And licensing comes basically after... Remember the aristocrats?
[01:25:28.903 --> 01:25:30.723]  And you probably saw them rob Roy in that.
[01:25:30.863 --> 01:25:32.304]  No, it's feudalism.
[01:25:32.324 --> 01:25:36.366]  You've got to have a li... A license is the authorization to do something that's illegal.
[01:25:36.586 --> 01:25:38.327]  So traveling is illegal in America.
[01:25:38.587 --> 01:25:38.767]  Right.
[01:25:38.847 --> 01:25:40.048]  And it's even more than that.
[01:25:40.128 --> 01:25:43.609]  It's the aristocrat being able to take your bride before you had her.
[01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:45.830]  That's what a licensure is.
[01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:51.713]  It's the ability of a sovereign... Because he owned you like deer on his property and prima nocte was practice.
[01:25:52.253 --> 01:25:53.153]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:25:53.373 --> 01:25:53.794]  Absolutely.
[01:25:54.114 --> 01:25:59.095]  So under that, we lost our law because what happened is administrative law came in.
[01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:06.357]  Under the National Industrial Recovery Act, that meant thousands of codes were adopted throughout the states.
[01:26:06.437 --> 01:26:09.298]  And that meant you had to conform to these codes.
[01:26:09.719 --> 01:26:19.081]  And the President then had the ability to regulate how many doctors would be licensed a year, how many pieces of china would be made, how they would be made.
[01:26:19.602 --> 01:26:20.802]  Every facet of our
[01:26:21.202 --> 01:26:24.445]  And now the global licensure is the Agenda 21.
[01:26:25.105 --> 01:26:25.906]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:26.146 --> 01:26:26.627]  Absolutely.
[01:26:27.067 --> 01:26:31.270]  And then also with the stealing of the wealth of the American people, I'll give you an example.
[01:26:31.951 --> 01:26:40.698]  In 1933, prior to the fiat currency, if you bought your house for $10,000, you had the title rights and interest in that house.
[01:26:40.778 --> 01:26:44.041]  But the very next day after the fiat money was enacted,
[01:26:44.674 --> 01:26:47.516]  Now you had $10,000 of federal lien on it.
[01:26:47.556 --> 01:26:50.958]  It was a swooping down of that valuation.
[01:26:51.298 --> 01:26:53.659]  They turned wealth into debt with a sleight of hand.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.881]  Yes, without one shot being fired.
[01:26:57.482 --> 01:27:01.124]  But here's the issue on the income.
[01:27:01.184 --> 01:27:02.024]  What is income?
[01:27:02.104 --> 01:27:09.729]  When you think about it, let me ask you, with your state income tax and your federal income tax, I'm going to describe them differently.
[01:27:10.296 --> 01:27:14.180]  The state income tax is a domestic income tax form.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.682]  It's whatever happens within the state.
[01:27:17.222 --> 01:27:23.248]  If that's the true nature of an income tax in the state, then what is that for the federal jurisdiction?
[01:27:23.288 --> 01:27:24.409]  I'm going to read one thing.
[01:27:24.449 --> 01:27:30.794]  The United States government is a foreign corporation with respect to the state, and that's volume 28, Corpus Juris Secundum, section 1785.
[01:27:30.834 --> 01:27:32.056]  So what is that federal income tax?
[01:27:36.326 --> 01:27:38.667]  It's international income tax form.
[01:27:39.207 --> 01:27:41.908]  How do you find yourself in international law?
[01:27:41.928 --> 01:27:44.728]  That's the law of the high seas, either Admiralty or Maritime.
[01:27:45.248 --> 01:27:51.210]  Admiralty being the contract on the high seas in a time of war, Maritime contract on the high seas in a time of peace.
[01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:54.791]  And that's why they always re-declare emergencies every year is to keep that going.
[01:27:55.504 --> 01:27:56.045]  Absolutely.
[01:27:56.325 --> 01:27:57.546]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.169]  The Federal Reserve is a foreign corporation.
[01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:03.752]  It is the creditor to the United States.
[01:28:04.272 --> 01:28:10.878]  And in Title 12, Section 411, it says that the Federal Reserve notes are obligations of the United States.
[01:28:10.938 --> 01:28:14.682]  That means the United States is the debtor, the Federal Reserve is the creditor.
[01:28:15.222 --> 01:28:16.904]  Now, let's put ourselves in the picture.
[01:28:17.544 --> 01:28:19.927]  Well, let's go right to the ports of entry.
[01:28:20.007 --> 01:28:26.315]  Every time a merchant brings in merchandise into this country, there's a duty put on that merchandise, isn't there?
[01:28:26.996 --> 01:28:29.319]  And he's working under international law.
[01:28:30.009 --> 01:28:34.093]  Well, I just described that the Federal Reserve is a foreign corporation.
[01:28:34.193 --> 01:28:35.774]  It is the credit of the United States.
[01:28:36.174 --> 01:28:46.924]  When you import a Federal Reserve note into your household, you now become a merchant, subject to international law having to pay a duty on those products.
[01:28:47.284 --> 01:28:48.485]  And I heard that once.
[01:28:48.925 --> 01:28:52.789]  I heard the Federal Reserve call their merchandise products.
[01:28:53.692 --> 01:29:06.042]  Now, you're importing and exporting every month, importing the Federal Reserve into your household, through your bank account, negotiating checks, what have you, and you export them out when you pay your PG&E, water bill, and everything else.
[01:29:06.442 --> 01:29:09.025]  That is the basis of income tax law.
[01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:25.738]  And if you read the Huntress, it'll tell you that revenue, and I probably should read it, it says, in this country, revenue causes have long been the subject of Admiralty cognizance that the Congress considered them as civil causes of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.
[01:29:26.258 --> 01:29:30.861]  And to preclude any doubt that might arise, carefully added the clause, including etc.
[01:29:30.921 --> 01:29:36.925]  This is clear proof that Congress considered these words to be used in the sense they were.
[01:29:36.945 --> 01:29:40.667]  And the point is, is that all income tax is revenue.
[01:29:40.787 --> 01:29:42.108]  Revenue is income tax.
[01:29:42.168 --> 01:29:42.928]  It's foreign.
[01:29:43.048 --> 01:29:46.110]  Well that's why England calls their tax, you know, the Inland Revenue System.
[01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:47.511]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[01:29:47.611 --> 01:29:49.932]  Long segment coming up with our guest to continue breaking it down.
[01:29:50.573 --> 01:29:51.473]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.974 --> 01:29:53.475]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.504 --> 01:29:57.174]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.273 --> 01:30:04.214]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:04.454 --> 01:30:10.495]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:10.855 --> 01:30:17.957]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:30:18.237 --> 01:30:22.838]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.701]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:31:04.221 --> 01:31:05.142]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.482 --> 01:31:09.124]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.324 --> 01:31:11.625]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:11.645 --> 01:31:17.088]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:17.508 --> 01:31:23.791]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.171 --> 01:31:29.734]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.154 --> 01:31:33.856]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.336 --> 01:31:38.277]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.617 --> 01:31:44.539]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.559 --> 01:31:47.500]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.101 --> 01:31:49.541]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.081 --> 01:31:50.601]  It's here.

[01:32:09.456 --> 01:32:13.758]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:32:14.218 --> 01:32:17.559]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:16.010]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:16.551 --> 01:33:23.873]  We've only got one segment left with Ron McDonald, author of They Own It All, Including You by Means of Toxic Currency.
[01:33:23.933 --> 01:33:26.114]  And I want to walk through this now.
[01:33:27.307 --> 01:33:33.071]  In the 17 minutes or so we have, Ron, and get into the fact that they own you as well.
[01:33:33.792 --> 01:33:35.072]  And they hide this in plain view.
[01:33:35.253 --> 01:33:38.655]  That's why they call us human resources.
[01:33:39.175 --> 01:33:41.397]  That's why the globalists openly say there's too many of us.
[01:33:41.817 --> 01:33:43.078]  We're a negative asset.
[01:33:43.098 --> 01:33:44.159]  They want to get rid of us.
[01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:47.961]  So first there's the process of takeover and domestication.
[01:33:48.382 --> 01:33:51.024]  Now there is the ongoing wars, the starvation.
[01:33:52.349 --> 01:33:56.470]  That's a State Department Memorandum 200 that they want to reduce world population.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:59.191]  Please continue breaking it down, all covered in the book.
[01:33:59.531 --> 01:34:00.731]  They own it all, including you.
[01:34:00.771 --> 01:34:02.231]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:34:02.992 --> 01:34:03.732]  Well, definitely.
[01:34:03.892 --> 01:34:10.233]  And the bottom line with using those notes, and most of your listeners already know this, is that they're a debtor's instrument.
[01:34:11.013 --> 01:34:12.234]  They do not pay off.
[01:34:12.434 --> 01:34:15.534]  They actually discharge a debt from one to another to another.
[01:34:16.155 --> 01:34:22.016]  They give no title, rights, and interest in anything that you purchase, so everything that you have does not belong to you.
[01:34:22.671 --> 01:34:29.653]  When your wife gives birth to your child, you actually pay the hospital with these Federal Reserve notes.
[01:34:29.973 --> 01:34:38.235]  That lien travels all the way through, right onto the baby's head, because that is the nature of what currency and what money is.
[01:34:38.715 --> 01:34:44.376]  It is the qualities within these instruments that flow through to the very thing that is purchased.
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:52.667]  Now, going back to the jurisdiction, considering what jurisdiction we're in, most of us think that we're in the common law jurisdiction.
[01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:55.390]  Probably not your listeners, but most Americans do.
[01:34:55.410 --> 01:34:59.394]  You know, if you ask them, is that Federal Reserve note the money of the United States?
[01:34:59.434 --> 01:35:00.275]  They say, certainly.
[01:35:00.815 --> 01:35:04.099]  They don't know that it is not domestic currency.
[01:35:04.399 --> 01:35:06.421]  They have no idea it's foreign currency.
[01:35:06.841 --> 01:35:15.827]  It'd be like if we were to import Japanese Yen right over here right now and sell our entire system with Japanese Yen, American people would be up in arms.
[01:35:16.407 --> 01:35:26.053]  But because they call it a Federal Reserve note, no one is aware that it's a foreign product not owned by the United States, not owned by you, it's owned by the Federal Reserve.
[01:35:26.113 --> 01:35:34.838]  And I guarantee you, if you try and take out 10,000 or more Federal Reserve out of this country, you've broken the law if you don't declare it, or if you pay your
[01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:40.653]  Your property tax with them, over 10,000, there's a red flag that goes up.
[01:35:40.733 --> 01:35:43.975]  Or if you put more than 10,000 in a bank, there's a red flag that goes up.
[01:35:44.015 --> 01:35:45.496]  And let's briefly talk about that.
[01:35:46.016 --> 01:35:49.458]  What's happening here is we think of the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[01:35:49.858 --> 01:35:50.959]  That's not a greenback.
[01:35:52.452 --> 01:35:52.973]  A U.S.
[01:35:53.013 --> 01:35:54.034]  government issued fiat.
[01:35:54.134 --> 01:35:57.519]  That is a private Federal Reserve fiat.
[01:35:57.919 --> 01:36:03.467]  And so when we hear about the dollar crisis worldwide, that's a fiat private banker crisis.
[01:36:03.487 --> 01:36:06.311]  They're using this system to control the world as well.
[01:36:07.352 --> 01:36:07.552]  Absolutely.
[01:36:07.572 --> 01:36:08.853]  It's in every country.
[01:36:08.893 --> 01:36:11.374]  It doesn't matter the nature of the currency.
[01:36:11.775 --> 01:36:15.937]  None of it is backed by a commodity that the people themselves own.
[01:36:16.377 --> 01:36:19.159]  And that's the one thing that people's eyes should be focused on.
[01:36:19.499 --> 01:36:21.940]  Do you actually own that that you're using?
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:22.821]  Well, no, you don't.
[01:36:24.036 --> 01:36:30.039]  And again, there was a quote in the New Testament that says, none shall buy nor sell without the mark of the beast.
[01:36:30.599 --> 01:36:33.561]  Well, you have to consider that the mark of the beast is invisible.
[01:36:33.641 --> 01:36:34.802]  It has to be invisible.
[01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:37.143]  It has to be the very nature of money.
[01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:43.726]  And when you examine that prophecy, it is a commercial prophecy, isn't it?
[01:36:44.066 --> 01:36:45.827]  Buying and selling is commerce.
[01:36:46.437 --> 01:36:50.458]  So you would have to look into that jurisdiction to see where that mark of the beast is.
[01:36:50.798 --> 01:36:51.359]  Well, here it is.
[01:36:51.419 --> 01:36:52.639]  It's right out there in the open.
[01:36:52.799 --> 01:36:55.680]  It is a lien that travels all the way around.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:00.521]  There's not one product, not one service in this country that isn't now liened.
[01:37:01.242 --> 01:37:07.103]  They own it all, including you, because we exist purely by means of this toxic currency.
[01:37:07.343 --> 01:37:13.465]  So he makes all take it, both free, both slave, great, small.
[01:37:14.026 --> 01:37:15.006]  Everyone uses it.
[01:37:17.918 --> 01:37:19.679]  Don't believe in a religion or not.
[01:37:20.159 --> 01:37:22.680]  This is a commercial prophecy.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:29.162]  It merely is the law of as far reaching as Babylon itself.
[01:37:29.282 --> 01:37:30.943]  It's the merchant law.
[01:37:31.163 --> 01:37:31.783]  That's all it is.
[01:37:32.441 --> 01:37:36.704]  But when we go through society, there's something that one should be aware of.
[01:37:37.525 --> 01:37:43.509]  Being in common law meant the law of the land came and arose from the land itself.
[01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:45.891]  The law of the land is common law.
[01:37:46.051 --> 01:37:48.033]  That's why it's stated like that.
[01:37:48.533 --> 01:37:59.436]  But when you're driving down, or let's say you go to register a vehicle, you'll see it from the DMV, you'll be given a form and it'll say, Vehicles backslash Vessel.
[01:37:59.716 --> 01:38:03.477]  Well that backsplash means equality.
[01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:04.978]  That means they mean the same thing.
[01:38:05.018 --> 01:38:09.699]  Well that should be your first clue that the jurisdictions are mixed right there.
[01:38:10.059 --> 01:38:12.740]  The land or the sea is mixed right on there.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:13.760]  But are they?
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:16.441]  When you're driving down the highway in your car,
[01:38:17.196 --> 01:38:20.838]  Do you not pass islands in the middle of the street?
[01:38:21.239 --> 01:38:22.319]  Are there painted islands?
[01:38:22.359 --> 01:38:23.460]  Are there raised islands?
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:26.802]  And what about those lanes called shipping lanes?
[01:38:26.822 --> 01:38:29.244]  Do you see the truck going down there with the cargo?
[01:38:29.744 --> 01:38:41.171]  And when that truck goes back and starts delivering its cargo, it backs up to a bay, which could be in the middle of a state, no water around, and unloads the cargo onto the dock.
[01:38:41.692 --> 01:38:43.673]  And what does the driver do?
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.742]  He hands over a bill of lading.
[01:38:46.802 --> 01:38:53.607]  Now, if you were to find the bill of lading, you could look in a law dictionary, and it'll say, for goods on a vessel.
[01:38:54.408 --> 01:38:56.570]  Now, did they confuse the terminology there?
[01:38:57.250 --> 01:39:02.354]  If you were to look up Ways Bill, if he had a Ways Bill, it would be goods on land.
[01:39:02.374 --> 01:39:04.316]  Do you see the nature of where we are right now?
[01:39:04.336 --> 01:39:10.161]  Let me back up what you're saying here, because I've read the SPP documents that Judicial Watch sued and got.
[01:39:10.781 --> 01:39:13.323]  I've studied the inland ports at Kansas City, and
[01:39:14.524 --> 01:39:30.163]  Dallas, Texas, and other areas, they admit that that's what the NAFTA superhighways are, are international jurisdiction taxation lanes and corridors that they admit is the international takeover of our country.
[01:39:30.223 --> 01:39:31.765]  So this is all actually admitted.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:39.262]  Yeah, and like I said, with the Merchant Law, highways were shipping lanes on the high seas.
[01:39:39.743 --> 01:39:45.805]  And back in the 50s, they changed all roads, all boulevards, all avenues into highways.
[01:39:45.865 --> 01:39:47.705]  And you have to ask why did they do that?
[01:39:47.806 --> 01:39:54.528]  Because what they did was bring into the system the Admiralty Maritime or the Commerce Jurisdiction.
[01:39:55.068 --> 01:39:59.770]  And even your previous commercial says, we'll ship anywhere.
[01:39:59.890 --> 01:40:00.130]  Ship.
[01:40:00.788 --> 01:40:08.008]  If you go to the post office after you leave it says thank you for your shipping and you may have just mailed the letter across to a neighbor for a birthday.
[01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:11.772]  How are you involved in shipping when you're on the land?
[01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:16.235]  And that's how the feds have the postal laws, and this is all admitted.
[01:40:16.275 --> 01:40:17.076]  That's what's incredible.
[01:40:17.096 --> 01:40:22.640]  When you go to court, it's all that Roman law, you know, praying to the court in your pleadings.
[01:40:23.561 --> 01:40:33.389]  It's all there in front of everyone, the ancient merchant law, and any good lawyer knows this, and it's supplanting the common law.
[01:40:33.829 --> 01:40:34.690]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:41.593]  So we've been separated from our common law, and the only way a man can defend is through his common law.
[01:40:41.653 --> 01:40:45.616]  That's where he actually gets his alienable rights and everything else.
[01:40:45.656 --> 01:40:53.520]  But when you put out to sea, then you have all the laws, all the immunities, all the privileges come from the Admiral.
[01:40:54.241 --> 01:40:57.723]  And that's where we are right now, and that's why we're in regulatory law.
[01:40:58.243 --> 01:40:59.524]  And everything is regulated.
[01:40:59.604 --> 01:41:03.787]  If you go through society, just count the things that you cannot do without permission.
[01:41:04.147 --> 01:41:08.409]  You cannot go through the intersection when it has to stop there without permission.
[01:41:08.449 --> 01:41:10.591]  You can't get into your car unless you have a license.
[01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:13.052]  You can't build a house unless you have a permit.
[01:41:13.112 --> 01:41:15.414]  You can't get married unless you have a license.
[01:41:15.434 --> 01:41:22.638]  You know, it is unbelievable how restrained Americans are, and they think they have liberty.
[01:41:23.622 --> 01:41:24.043]  It's not there.
[01:41:24.263 --> 01:41:46.925]  And now we're entering an intensification in this phase where they are really expanding this international private corporate jurisdiction with their admirals, Janet Napolitano, the regional governor, the ten governors over the ten FEMA regions, the government in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act admitting there's a takeover.
[01:41:48.089 --> 01:41:49.629]  You have the cities within a city.
[01:41:49.649 --> 01:41:55.451]  You have London, the city of London within London, who admittedly is its own private corporate sovereign land.
[01:41:55.751 --> 01:42:00.193]  You have the Vatican that's its own private corporate sovereign land and set up the EU.
[01:42:00.493 --> 01:42:16.958]  You have the Washington DC, this command base, this district of the Admiralty, and what's incredible is you read globalist reports that are public, this is common knowledge to them, but you tell the general public this, you tell a state police officer that they're really
[01:42:17.719 --> 01:42:18.360]  Absolutely.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:20.122]  You know, I'll give you an example.
[01:42:20.163 --> 01:42:22.086]  Here in the state of California, where I am,
[01:42:31.553 --> 01:42:33.455]  They have two codes in the government codes.
[01:42:33.575 --> 01:42:36.018]  One is 6850, and I'll quote it.
[01:42:36.038 --> 01:42:39.722]  It says, the money of account of this state is the dollar the cent of the mill.
[01:42:39.742 --> 01:42:42.686]  They're referring back to the weight of gold or silver.
[01:42:43.246 --> 01:42:45.869]  That's what the money of account of California is.
[01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:48.812]  But it also says in 6852, it says, all legal tender notes.
[01:42:51.718 --> 01:42:56.181]  Issued by the United States and I emphasize issued by the United States.
[01:42:56.581 --> 01:43:03.766]  She'll be received at par and payment for all taxes due this state or to any county or municipal corporation of the state.
[01:43:04.066 --> 01:43:06.848]  Now understand it says issued by the United States.
[01:43:06.908 --> 01:43:09.449]  Is a Federal Reserve note issued by the United States?
[01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:13.532]  It's issued to the United States from the Federal Reserve.
[01:43:14.409 --> 01:43:25.376]  There is no law in the state of California, and I've researched them all, all the codes and statutes, that says they have a right to accept Federal Reserve notes or foreign product into this state.
[01:43:25.837 --> 01:43:28.258]  See, that's a crucial point, and that's in every state.
[01:43:45.170 --> 01:43:46.791]  You're absolutely on point.
[01:43:46.831 --> 01:43:47.972]  That's the bottom line.
[01:43:48.132 --> 01:43:56.199]  When you go and you're hired by an employer, you agree to accept Federal Reserve notes, $8 an hour, $10 an hour, whatever it is.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.481]  You've agreed to it, but... Oh, absolutely.
[01:43:58.561 --> 01:43:58.782]  Absolutely.
[01:43:58.842 --> 01:43:59.422]  And as far as
[01:44:12.273 --> 01:44:13.353]  Do we own property?
[01:44:13.413 --> 01:44:20.236]  Here it is right here in Senate Document Number 43, Senate Resolution 62, Page 9, Paragraph 2, April 17, 1933.
[01:44:20.336 --> 01:44:25.037]  Same year that we went off the gold standard.
[01:44:25.057 --> 01:44:29.119]  And I quote, The ultimate ownership of all property is in the state.
[01:44:29.319 --> 01:44:35.981]  Individual so-called ownership is only by virtue of government example, law amounting to mere user.
[01:44:36.541 --> 01:44:41.723]  And use must be in accordance with the law and subordinate to the necessities of the state.
[01:44:42.123 --> 01:44:47.251]  Now the state is not necessarily your state, it's the creditor is the state in this thing.
[01:44:47.491 --> 01:44:53.279]  And notice, and notice when you get software, you are not the owner, you are the user.
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:57.706]  When you buy a car now, you don't buy it, they hold, as we said earlier,
[01:44:58.386 --> 01:44:59.427]  You know, they hold the title.
[01:44:59.487 --> 01:45:00.668]  You are the user.
[01:45:00.928 --> 01:45:03.529]  We are literally feudal serfs and slaves.
[01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:13.115]  All this is is a 21st century version of ancient feudalism that was operated the same way in Japan, Babylon, Albion, which is England.
[01:45:13.375 --> 01:45:14.256]  It's the same system.
[01:45:14.776 --> 01:45:17.198]  Oh, absolutely, and that's the bottom line.
[01:45:17.538 --> 01:45:20.721]  And this is what you're taxed on, using the product.
[01:45:21.021 --> 01:45:23.764]  Not on the product itself, but the use of the product.
[01:45:24.404 --> 01:45:29.088]  And the bottom line to all this is this is an unconscionable contract.
[01:45:29.488 --> 01:45:35.153]  Because, ask any American, and they honestly believe that that is real money of the United States.
[01:45:35.553 --> 01:45:37.814]  They have no clue it is not their money.
[01:45:37.854 --> 01:45:45.356]  And a contract executed in fraud by either party is null and void under every common law system globally.
[01:45:46.656 --> 01:45:47.776]  Again, absolutely.
[01:45:48.176 --> 01:45:58.659]  And at the bottom line of the contract, when someone deals to you a worthless instrument for your actual labor, that is criminal conversion, isn't it?
[01:45:59.622 --> 01:46:00.522]  And that's what happened in 1913.
[01:46:00.762 --> 01:46:02.663]  They got the Federal Reserve.
[01:46:02.783 --> 01:46:05.284]  They got rid of our senators being state-controlled.
[01:46:05.764 --> 01:46:07.085]  They brought in the income tax.
[01:46:07.425 --> 01:46:08.725]  That was the true coup d'etat.
[01:46:08.745 --> 01:46:12.107]  The beachhead, 33, total receivership.
[01:46:12.587 --> 01:46:15.408]  Since then, we are under total foreign banking cartel.
[01:46:15.888 --> 01:46:18.229]  And from your research, Rothschild, Rockefeller,
[01:46:18.649 --> 01:46:18.849]  Yes.
[01:46:18.869 --> 01:46:19.169]  Absolutely.
[01:46:19.209 --> 01:46:21.671]  You know the difference between a Federal Reserve note and a gold coin?
[01:46:21.691 --> 01:46:25.534]  If you put a lawful gold coin in a mason jar and held it for 20 years, it would still be the same amount
[01:46:46.952 --> 01:46:48.594]  It would not duplicate itself.
[01:46:48.614 --> 01:46:49.495]  It would not increase.
[01:46:49.855 --> 01:46:54.520]  But take that Federal Reserve note that draws interest every second of every day.
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.101]  Put it in a mason jar.
[01:46:56.181 --> 01:47:05.751]  If it's a $20 Federal Reserve note, in 10 years, it will have doubled, tripled, or whatever, because it has a rising debt to it.
[01:47:05.871 --> 01:47:12.154]  Yeah, to explain that, 5,000 years ago, a man could buy the finest, you know, suit of clothes for one gold ounce coin.
[01:47:12.434 --> 01:47:16.916]  You could still buy, you know, a very nice suit and clothes for that one gold coin.
[01:47:16.936 --> 01:47:19.138]  And people get confused.
[01:47:19.158 --> 01:47:20.358]  They go, well, why do I buy gold?
[01:47:20.418 --> 01:47:21.259]  Okay, it was, it was...
[01:47:22.685 --> 01:47:22.945]  Yeah.
[01:47:22.965 --> 01:47:23.226]  Absolutely.
[01:47:40.566 --> 01:47:50.992]  You know, and I can't continue without saying how they defined the income tax on the first case, and it was called Bruce Schaefer v. Union Pacific Railroad, 240 U.S.
[01:47:51.052 --> 01:47:54.134]  1F, a 1916 case.
[01:47:54.714 --> 01:48:04.619]  And the constitutionality of the income tax was pursued, and it is this case, and the government of the United States cites as to the constitutionality of the income tax.
[01:48:04.639 --> 01:48:07.181]  I'm going to quote what Chief Justice White said.
[01:48:07.651 --> 01:48:17.942]  And I quote, the appellate filed his bill to enjoin or command the corporation from complying with income tax provision of the Tariff Act of October 3, 1913.
[01:48:19.303 --> 01:48:22.206]  Most people reading that wouldn't understand what was just said there.
[01:48:22.679 --> 01:48:25.440]  But he identified the tax as a tariff.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.620]  Do you know what a tariff is?
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:30.762]  Yeah, it's a foreign corporate government putting a tariff on us.
[01:48:30.822 --> 01:48:34.103]  I mean, this is total economic domination.
[01:48:34.943 --> 01:48:37.744]  I'm going to have you back up for a full hour to take calls in the near future.
[01:48:37.804 --> 01:48:40.965]  The book is They Own It All, Including You, by Means of Toxic Currency.
[01:48:41.285 --> 01:48:43.766]  Ron McDonald and Robert Rowan, M.D.
[01:48:46.047 --> 01:48:47.628]  It's a thick book, but an easy read.
[01:48:47.688 --> 01:48:50.090]  It's about 220 pages long.
[01:48:50.170 --> 01:48:51.551]  It's very well documented.
[01:48:51.751 --> 01:48:52.952]  Everybody needs this.
[01:48:53.312 --> 01:48:55.733]  You think you know it all about the Federal Reserve System, folks?
[01:48:56.234 --> 01:49:02.778]  I learned a lot from this book, and I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com and get it, or simply call 888-253-3139.
[01:49:02.798 --> 01:49:05.340]  Buy one for yourself.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:06.180]  Give one as a gift.
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:07.861]  Give it to local bankers you know.
[01:49:07.961 --> 01:49:09.863]  Most of them don't know, because
[01:49:10.803 --> 01:49:14.746]  They are now using this to remove the actual resources from us.
[01:49:14.766 --> 01:49:16.047]  This is very predatory.
[01:49:16.488 --> 01:49:18.149]  These people are extremely dangerous.
[01:49:18.289 --> 01:49:21.432]  As you're now seeing, we're coming to the end of this phase.
[01:49:22.532 --> 01:49:23.994]  It's only going to get crazier from here.
[01:49:24.454 --> 01:49:25.395]  Knowledge is power.
[01:49:25.455 --> 01:49:28.057]  The people perish for lack of knowledge, as Jesus Christ said.
[01:49:28.637 --> 01:49:31.880]  This book, they own it all, including you, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:33.261]  We've got about a minute left, Ron.
[01:49:33.681 --> 01:49:36.804]  In closing, how do we get out of this?
[01:49:36.844 --> 01:49:38.005]  How do we extricate ourselves?
[01:49:38.575 --> 01:49:43.998]  Well, the first thing that people have to do is look at their states as their own home.
[01:49:44.438 --> 01:49:45.899]  This is your house.
[01:49:46.139 --> 01:49:46.759]  Clean it up.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:55.784]  If all 50 states were to start tackling their own states and not worry about the other states, we would take back this country within a month.
[01:49:56.164 --> 01:49:57.525]  There's no doubt in my mind.
[01:49:57.885 --> 01:50:03.608]  We have to change the nature of currency to an honest money system, and we can do that.
[01:50:04.366 --> 01:50:12.433]  Well, if you look at the Homeland Security grid, the John Moore Defense Authorization Act, and all the rest of it, it's all designed and stated to suppress the states, to remove governors.
[01:50:12.453 --> 01:50:18.458]  I mean, because they know our legitimate redress is to take the states back and then take the central government back.
[01:50:19.239 --> 01:50:19.339]  Yes.
[01:50:20.051 --> 01:50:28.075]  Well, there are a lot of remedies to this, including how to get your state to act, and that would have to be important.
[01:50:28.415 --> 01:50:35.679]  I'm going to have you back on, because I know you've got a really good idea that you've been promoting, and we'll get you back either the first of the year or even in the next few weeks.
[01:50:36.459 --> 01:50:41.742]  Ron McDonald, thank you so much, and of course, Robert Rowan, also MD, you're a co-author.
[01:50:41.802 --> 01:50:42.242]  Great job.
[01:50:42.282 --> 01:50:43.303]  They own it all, including you.
[01:50:43.883 --> 01:50:44.624]  Hope you get it, folks.
[01:50:44.684 --> 01:50:45.924]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:49.446 --> 01:50:50.747]  Ron, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:50:50.767 --> 01:50:51.227]  Great job.
[01:50:51.247 --> 01:50:52.408]  And let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:50:53.148 --> 01:50:53.589]  All right, folks.
[01:50:53.609 --> 01:50:55.110]  We're going to come back and get into The Globalist.
[01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:58.132]  Don't want us talking about this, so they're getting ready to try to shut down the media.
[01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:01.714]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.754 --> 01:51:07.117]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.357 --> 01:51:11.980]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.361 --> 01:51:12.761]  It's true.
[01:51:12.841 --> 01:51:15.422]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:15.663 --> 01:51:17.404]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:17.924 --> 01:51:22.627]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.148 --> 01:51:30.073]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.273 --> 01:51:31.173]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.393 --> 01:51:37.758]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:40.900]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:43.142]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:46.725 --> 01:51:49.067]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:49.487 --> 01:51:56.813]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.133 --> 01:51:59.575]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:00.516 --> 01:52:01.336]  Pure water.
[01:52:01.637 --> 01:52:04.098]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[01:52:04.339 --> 01:52:07.381]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday season than Big Bird

[01:52:59.468 --> 01:53:01.048]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:53:01.209 --> 01:53:02.309]  How would that make you feel?
[01:53:02.569 --> 01:53:03.910]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:06.572]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:53:06.812 --> 01:53:14.097]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:53:14.378 --> 01:53:18.060]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:53:18.621 --> 01:53:23.684]  I started taking hardened body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:53:23.944 --> 01:53:28.948]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:29.148 --> 01:53:34.030]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[01:53:43.372 --> 01:53:46.733]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:53:46.753 --> 01:53:51.435]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:51.455 --> 01:53:55.296]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:54:14.139 --> 01:54:16.703]  Max Keiser, Lane Madsen popping in in the next hour.
[01:54:16.723 --> 01:54:22.150]  Got some other really informative guests coming up in the next few days, I believe Lord Monkton and others.
[01:54:26.275 --> 01:54:30.859]  FCC pushed to regulate news, draws fire, the Hill newspaper.
[01:54:31.699 --> 01:54:37.964]  And they've got all these different FCC board members going on international television, national television, and pitching it.
[01:54:38.424 --> 01:54:40.826]  We think there needs to be quality of news.
[01:54:40.946 --> 01:54:43.788]  That's what Jay Rockefeller said a few weeks ago.
[01:54:43.828 --> 01:54:46.650]  And that's why we want to shut down Fox and MSNBC.
[01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:47.531]  They're partisan.
[01:54:48.212 --> 01:54:50.133]  They're getting people arguing politically.
[01:54:50.173 --> 01:54:50.974]  We can't have that.
[01:54:51.014 --> 01:54:53.436]  And you've got to prove you're serving your community.
[01:54:54.281 --> 01:54:58.883]  And then now the FCC announced this week that they will regulate the internet, even internet talk radio.
[01:54:58.963 --> 01:55:00.143]  You've got to get a license.
[01:55:00.444 --> 01:55:04.105]  The government's going to set up community boards that decide if you get to have a show.
[01:55:06.166 --> 01:55:06.766]  They're panicked.
[01:55:08.087 --> 01:55:08.727]  They're scared.
[01:55:09.707 --> 01:55:13.189]  They know that people are becoming wise to them.
[01:55:13.549 --> 01:55:16.230]  They know that people are waking up to them.
[01:55:19.855 --> 01:55:21.136]  There's a new Drudge Report out here.
[01:55:21.196 --> 01:55:25.058]  Sources, editors of Time Magazine will name WikiLeaks founder, person of the year, developing.
[01:55:25.738 --> 01:55:28.640]  We're going to get into WikiLeaks coming up in about 10 minutes with Wayne Madsen.
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:32.101]  But getting back into this FCC situation, here's the hill.
[01:55:32.562 --> 01:55:35.123]  Maybe you'll listen to them when they tell you, some of you out there that are in denial.
[01:55:35.563 --> 01:55:44.148]  Republican Joe Barton pushed back on money against a contention by Democratic FCC Commissioner that the government should create new regulations to promote diversity in news programming.
[01:55:45.134 --> 01:55:57.338]  Barton was reacting to a proposal made last week by FCC Commissioner Michael Kopsch, who was in a speech suggesting that broadcasters be subject to new public values test every four years.
[01:55:57.358 --> 01:56:02.840]  So you have to have a license from the government to be able to have a website, news blog, you name it.
[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:07.341]  Let's go ahead and play the FCC head on BBC.
[01:56:07.401 --> 01:56:11.143]  And even the BBC, that's state-run propaganda, was shocked by what he said.
[01:56:11.183 --> 01:56:11.503]  Here it is.
[01:56:12.671 --> 01:56:15.393]  In what you call its hour of grave peril.
[01:56:15.413 --> 01:56:17.435]  That's a pretty serious condemnation.
[01:56:17.815 --> 01:56:19.656]  It's a pretty serious situation that we're in.
[01:56:19.736 --> 01:56:23.980]  I think American media has a bad case of substance abuse right now.
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:31.085]  We are not producing the body of news and information that democracy needs to conduct its civic dialogue.
[01:56:31.345 --> 01:56:31.606]  Hit pause!
[01:56:31.626 --> 01:56:33.167]  We're not producing as much news as we...
[01:56:33.992 --> 01:56:36.094]  I mean listen to the FCC member.
[01:56:36.735 --> 01:56:46.083]  FCC commissariat like in East Germany or Russia where there was a government board that decided if your play could get made or you could get on television and they got all the women and power out of it.
[01:56:46.644 --> 01:56:48.025]  It's pure top-down tyranny.
[01:56:49.458 --> 01:56:50.599]  You mean the New York Times?
[01:56:50.639 --> 01:56:54.242]  You mean Fox and CNN that promoted the government's lies about WMDs?
[01:56:54.622 --> 01:56:57.024]  You mean the mainstream media that tells us fluoride is good?
[01:56:57.044 --> 01:57:02.868]  This is meant to shut down any political debate or discussion that isn't establishment government written.
[01:57:02.888 --> 01:57:09.052]  The government has been paying billions of dollars a year into corporate media to prop it up, to put out propaganda.
[01:57:09.773 --> 01:57:14.636]  Now the alternative media has overthrown them and they realize that so they're rushing in to shut us down.
[01:57:14.856 --> 01:57:16.818]  Let's continue with this slime bag on American.
[01:57:17.751 --> 01:57:34.561]  Five years, ten years, fifteen years ago, and we have to reverse that trend or I think we are going to be pretty close to denying our citizens the essential news and information that they need to have in order to make intelligent decisions about the future direction of their country.
[01:57:35.041 --> 01:57:39.904]  See, we need government programming of TV and radio and print to make intelligent decisions.
[01:57:41.127 --> 01:57:42.088]  Oh yes, yes.
[01:57:43.410 --> 01:57:45.673]  We need telescreens in the shopping malls.
[01:57:46.014 --> 01:57:47.075]  We need checkpoints.
[01:57:47.135 --> 01:57:48.136]  We need open borders.
[01:57:48.196 --> 01:57:49.538]  We need fluoride in our water.
[01:57:49.578 --> 01:57:50.379]  We need lithium.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:54.424]  That's the FCC Commissioner Michael Copps trying to police free speech.
[01:57:54.464 --> 01:57:55.746]  Let's go back to this Commissar.
[01:57:55.766 --> 01:57:56.126]  Here he is.
[01:57:56.946 --> 01:58:02.230]  What you've called for to redress this situation is what you're calling a public value test.
[01:58:02.751 --> 01:58:08.676]  Doesn't that raise the specter of overt government control of information?
[01:58:08.696 --> 01:58:12.879]  I mean, people would say to you, well, what one person's public value is, is not another person's.
[01:58:13.019 --> 01:58:18.063]  What we've had in recent years is an aberration where we have had no oversight of the media.
[01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:21.406]  For years and years we had some public interest guidelines.
[01:58:22.467 --> 01:58:23.047]  Alright, pause.
[01:58:24.048 --> 01:58:28.251]  Americans didn't know what radio was 90 years ago, so the government could come in and take it over.
[01:58:28.691 --> 01:58:30.993]  Before that, we had complete free-for-all, free speech.
[01:58:31.313 --> 01:58:32.534]  That's America, scumbag.
[01:58:32.574 --> 01:58:34.715]  I'm gonna come back and finish up with the rest of it.
[01:58:35.035 --> 01:58:35.656]  But you know what?
[01:58:36.496 --> 01:58:38.258]  Earlier I said I'd tell you the key to WikiLeaks.
[01:58:38.278 --> 01:58:43.941]  I'll tell you that when we come back, too.
[01:58:44.001 --> 01:58:47.764]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.494 --> 01:58:55.118]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.518 --> 01:58:58.522]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:58.762 --> 01:59:03.547]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:03.567 --> 01:59:09.794]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:09.954 --> 01:59:12.177]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:12.717 --> 01:59:12.997]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.017 --> 01:59:13.437]  Bernanke?
[01:59:13.537 --> 01:59:14.298]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.318 --> 01:59:15.458]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.478 --> 01:59:17.719]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:31.624 --> 01:59:33.465]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:33.745 --> 01:59:38.527]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:38.887 --> 01:59:48.830]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:53.192 --> 01:59:55.113]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.573 --> 01:59:58.334]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.912 --> 02:00:05.552]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.213 --> 02:00:07.253]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.994 --> 02:00:09.094]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.755 --> 02:00:10.555]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.336 --> 02:00:12.236]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.877 --> 02:00:16.519]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.079 --> 02:00:21.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.263 --> 02:00:27.585]  We are back live into hour number three.
[02:00:29.146 --> 02:00:30.627]  News blitz coming up.
[02:00:31.247 --> 02:00:32.528]  Two guests popping in.
[02:00:33.769 --> 02:00:35.050]  The latest on WikiLeaks.
[02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:43.157]  They know it's outrageous to be taken over the airports and the rest of transportation sticking their hands down your pants and putting you through radiation bathers.
[02:00:43.697 --> 02:00:52.885]  But if they can break our will and get away with this and put telescreens in all the major public places and Walmart and shopping malls and Mall of America giving us orders...
[02:00:55.202 --> 02:00:58.883]  Then they're going to successfully convert us to a Nazi Germany type system.
[02:00:59.284 --> 02:01:00.364]  So the choice is now here.
[02:01:00.404 --> 02:01:05.926]  That's why we've got to boycott flying, and if you've got to fly, boycott the body scanning and the rest of it.
[02:01:07.667 --> 02:01:09.427]  And we've got to boycott Walmart.
[02:01:10.428 --> 02:01:17.030]  Now, we're going to get into WikiLeaks, but it's been said by many others the last few days, and I agree with them, and I've been saying this for months myself.
[02:01:18.371 --> 02:01:18.911]  This is
[02:01:20.222 --> 02:01:23.024]  The Internet's 9-11.
[02:01:23.824 --> 02:01:24.985]  And now the government's saying that.
[02:01:25.025 --> 02:01:30.068]  We've got to pass this law to restrict what's on the web and have web IDs and tax it.
[02:01:30.408 --> 02:01:32.309]  We've got to start shutting down free speech.
[02:01:32.650 --> 02:01:39.934]  Look, Julian Assange, when he's not running around having unprotected sex with women connected to the CIA, that's what he's charged with.
[02:01:39.954 --> 02:01:40.655]  That's the headline.
[02:01:40.975 --> 02:01:41.935]  Not wearing a condom.
[02:01:43.656 --> 02:01:46.358]  And the women had sex with him again and had him at parties.
[02:01:46.398 --> 02:01:47.339]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:01:47.639 --> 02:01:48.900]  This is political correctness.
[02:01:51.069 --> 02:01:52.610]  Now they've got him, no bail!
[02:01:54.672 --> 02:01:59.696]  And I smell a rat, I know Soros is connected to this, but why aren't we talking about what's in the leaks?
[02:02:00.096 --> 02:02:02.879]  Why aren't we talking about the evidence of corruption it shows?
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:09.464]  Again, I don't know what's going on here, but I do know it's being used as a internet free speech 9-11.
[02:02:09.604 --> 02:02:17.451]  And I've been predicting, actually for a year, they're going to use WikiLeaks to try to start shutting down freedom on the web and track everything.
[02:02:18.339 --> 02:02:20.760]  And they're already setting the grids up to do it and making the announcements.
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.441]  Let's finish up with the FCC head, COPS.
[02:02:23.802 --> 02:02:25.482]  Here he is.
[02:02:25.582 --> 02:02:31.085]  So what you've called for to redress this situation is what you're calling a public value test.
[02:02:31.605 --> 02:02:37.528]  Doesn't that raise the specter of overt government control of information?
[02:02:37.988 --> 02:02:41.710]  People would say to you what one person's public value is, is not another person's.
[02:02:41.850 --> 02:02:44.711]  What we've had in recent years is an aberration.
[02:02:46.132 --> 02:02:55.039]  He doesn't deny it's a government taking over and deciding if you can have a blog, or a radio show, or a newspaper, or a TV channel, or a radio station.
[02:02:55.239 --> 02:02:56.140]  He doesn't deny that.
[02:02:56.981 --> 02:02:58.462]  He just says we've had an aberration.
[02:02:58.542 --> 02:03:03.506]  No, the aberration came with the FCC and the Fairness Doctrine that is pure Soviet tyranny.
[02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:11.314]  I do believe local news should have corporations and sponsors that step up during elections to give a lot of candidates more attention.
[02:03:11.514 --> 02:03:13.236]  But I do not believe in the Fairness Doctrine.
[02:03:13.536 --> 02:03:14.657]  Because it's totally unfair.
[02:03:14.697 --> 02:03:17.139]  Like the Patriot Act is totally unpatriotic.
[02:03:17.519 --> 02:03:20.661]  Or the New Freedom Initiative to try to force drug half of American children.
[02:03:20.822 --> 02:03:22.303]  That's public news for six years.
[02:03:22.643 --> 02:03:23.544]  It's not New Freedom.
[02:03:23.884 --> 02:03:28.247]  Let's finish up with this ghoulish East German type thug.
[02:03:28.267 --> 02:03:29.588]  He makes me want to throw up!
[02:03:30.269 --> 02:03:30.990]  Go back to him!
[02:03:31.778 --> 02:03:32.739]  ...side of the media.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:45.073]  For years and years, we had some public interest guidelines, uh, that was part of the quid pro quo between broadcasters, uh, and the government for the free use of airwaves that belong to the American people.
[02:03:45.113 --> 02:03:45.393]  Hit pause.
[02:03:45.453 --> 02:03:46.434]  You gotta love that spin.
[02:03:46.514 --> 02:03:47.956]  Oh, the airwaves belong to the American people.
[02:03:47.976 --> 02:03:49.558]  That's why foreign corporations own it.
[02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:59.376]  And now, because the bandwidth's open, and the bandwidth on radio's unlimited, basically, and internet's unlimited, they're like, oh, we've got to come in and shut it down!
[02:03:59.636 --> 02:04:04.160]  It's because it's unlimited, and these arrogant people thought they'd use the web to control us.
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:10.044]  Instead, it's backfiring on them, so now this ghoul comes out and says he's going after our free speech.
[02:04:10.304 --> 02:04:11.865]  Cat's out of the bag, zombie!
[02:04:12.245 --> 02:04:14.047]  Cat's out of the bag, Nosferatu!
[02:04:14.067 --> 02:04:17.649]  I mean, he looks like Nosferatu from the German 1920s film.
[02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:18.310]  Put him back up.
[02:04:20.531 --> 02:04:21.452]  Play Nosferatu.
[02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:35.136]  By the way, when he says news and information, it's all right, good for you, the family is bad, wars are good, cutting people's pensions is good, paying the bankers all our money is good, worshipping the Federal Reserve is good, being a slave is good,
[02:04:50.163 --> 02:04:53.624]  Government telescreens to give us their orders, and they want to take the media over?
[02:04:53.964 --> 02:04:54.925]  Have you figured it out?
[02:04:55.385 --> 02:04:56.425]  We're not exaggerating.
[02:04:56.465 --> 02:04:58.506]  These people are out-of-control crooks.
[02:05:00.306 --> 02:05:00.887]  Hello, friends.
[02:05:00.907 --> 02:05:01.907]  This is Alex Jones.

[02:05:52.649 --> 02:05:53.470]  Thank you!
[02:05:59.807 --> 02:06:04.030]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:04.951]  Number 1.
[02:06:05.271 --> 02:06:08.413]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:08.694 --> 02:06:09.254]  Number 2.
[02:06:09.554 --> 02:06:14.098]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:14.438 --> 02:06:14.898]  It's true.
[02:06:15.178 --> 02:06:19.742]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.062 --> 02:06:20.602]  Number 3.
[02:06:20.883 --> 02:06:24.165]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:24.465 --> 02:06:28.168]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.368 --> 02:06:28.909]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.169 --> 02:06:31.531]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:31.932 --> 02:06:35.315]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:35.616 --> 02:06:35.816]  Number 5.
[02:06:36.396 --> 02:06:40.321]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:40.541 --> 02:06:45.306]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:45.586 --> 02:06:49.612]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:49.772 --> 02:06:51.334]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.554 --> 02:06:53.637]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:06:53.797 --> 02:06:56.141]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:03.072]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[02:07:07.713 --> 02:07:12.333]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:07:12.353 --> 02:07:17.594]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:07:18.354 --> 02:07:25.576]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:07:28.172 --> 02:07:32.455]  I'm looking for America.
[02:07:33.676 --> 02:07:35.117]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:07:35.297 --> 02:07:37.859]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:07:37.899 --> 02:07:42.101]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[02:07:42.422 --> 02:07:46.244]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:07:54.102 --> 02:07:58.704]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:08:01.285 --> 02:08:03.486]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:03.526 --> 02:08:06.908]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.989 --> 02:08:14.311]  Max Keiser coming up in about 25 minutes until the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:16.272 --> 02:08:20.974]  Journalist, researcher, formerly with the NSA, Wayne Madsen is going to be joining us coming up in about two minutes.
[02:08:23.814 --> 02:08:28.957]  But, if you look at the Hill newspaper today, FCC pushed to regulate news draws fire.
[02:08:29.317 --> 02:08:31.358]  I just played the head of the FCC, the chairman.
[02:08:31.798 --> 02:08:38.081]  Say, freedom on the internet, freedom on radio, freedom in the media is an aberration.
[02:08:38.161 --> 02:08:42.283]  The government will give you a license and you will not make political distinctions.
[02:08:42.303 --> 02:08:44.664]  You will not have political views in America.
[02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:50.807]  And that's because the big mainline TV and radio, they already pay for that with your stimulus money.
[02:08:51.347 --> 02:08:52.268]  It's state-run media.
[02:08:53.393 --> 02:09:01.158]  And they'll publicly punish some of them and make a scene out of it as Jay Rockefeller said, I'd shut down Fox and MSNBC if I could.
[02:09:01.599 --> 02:09:03.040]  We'd be better off without the Internet.
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.221]  Well, what they're giving you isn't the free Internet.
[02:09:05.622 --> 02:09:10.565]  But remember, Kurt Nemo, we read the proposals months ago.
[02:09:10.605 --> 02:09:11.506]  This was in June.
[02:09:11.546 --> 02:09:13.067]  This was three, four months ago or more.
[02:09:14.878 --> 02:09:17.462]  FCC stealth plan to censor internet content.
[02:09:17.782 --> 02:09:22.048]  And this week they announced, we have jurisdiction over the internet to protect it.
[02:09:22.368 --> 02:09:24.931]  Kind of like Hitler was the guardian of the Reich.
[02:09:25.472 --> 02:09:28.116]  And Stalin was the guardian of Russia.
[02:09:30.976 --> 02:09:33.317]  So the point is, this stuff is now out in the open.
[02:09:33.357 --> 02:09:41.140]  Now, inner WikiLeaks, regardless of what you think about Assange, he's a hero, he's a bad guy, he's a useful idiot, he's an evil mastermind.
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:48.162]  No matter what your view is of him, he's being used, as I said a year ago and six months ago, it'll be used to censor the internet.
[02:09:48.182 --> 02:09:49.583]  Now they've got two bills introduced,
[02:09:50.083 --> 02:09:57.209]  To basically censor the web, make you have web IDs, to put you in prison for life if you let any government secret out that's even mild.
[02:09:57.389 --> 02:10:03.313]  I would go to prison for the police sending me the MIAC report where Homeland Security is really for the American people.
[02:10:03.734 --> 02:10:08.597]  The government's going into a very criminal phase right now because they're collapsing the world economy by design.
[02:10:08.958 --> 02:10:09.438]  They know it.
[02:10:10.999 --> 02:10:24.549]  Assange has been arrested and I've said I said days ago I said I believe they're gonna flush him down the toilet just like Lee Harvey Oswald Or just like any of their other puppets I I believe that because I can't from what I've seen that he really believes He's doing a good job.
[02:10:24.849 --> 02:10:32.754]  He's being used as the front man There's all these lawyers and people behind the scenes that do have the Soros connections and now they're holding him on
[02:10:33.871 --> 02:10:38.094]  Having consensual sex, but the woman complained and said, don't you want to use a condom?
[02:10:38.114 --> 02:10:39.835]  And he said, no, honey, let's not.
[02:10:39.855 --> 02:10:40.936]  And they said, OK, let's go.
[02:10:41.156 --> 02:10:42.617]  Then they had a party for him the next day.
[02:10:42.957 --> 02:10:49.101]  And these women, we have the article up on Infowars.com and AP's reporting on it.
[02:10:49.901 --> 02:10:54.124]  There's also mainline reports from Raw Story.
[02:10:54.224 --> 02:10:59.428]  It is confirmed that at least one woman worked directly inside a CIA operation against Fidel Castro.
[02:11:00.548 --> 02:11:07.091]  That she's this wild feminist, which Gloria Steinem admitted five years ago that she was CIA, Miss Magazine was CIA.
[02:11:07.911 --> 02:11:08.851]  They don't care about women.
[02:11:08.871 --> 02:11:12.893]  They want to break families up so everybody has to pay taxes and so the state can raise children.
[02:11:13.848 --> 02:11:16.288]  It's time for women and men to get together against the globalists.
[02:11:16.829 --> 02:11:21.930]  But, turns out she writes blogs about how to set men up, how to get your revenge.
[02:11:22.230 --> 02:11:26.891]  She believes, as is taught by most feminists, that all sex is an act of rape.
[02:11:26.971 --> 02:11:33.372]  So, and hey, you know, liberal Sweden, globalist Sweden, I mean, how is that supposedly liberal?
[02:11:34.192 --> 02:11:38.233]  They are on record, you know, saying, yeah, no, unprotected sex, he's going to go to prison.
[02:11:38.593 --> 02:11:42.714]  And the British say, absolutely, we're holding him, and now they're going after him on money issues.
[02:11:43.794 --> 02:11:48.596]  And I would imagine his lawyers advise him, well, the fact that he's admitted to turn himself in, everything will be okay.
[02:11:49.036 --> 02:11:51.598]  See, the first judge laughed this out in Europe.
[02:11:51.618 --> 02:11:52.218]  They don't care.
[02:11:53.378 --> 02:11:56.060]  So, this is very, very, very, very serious.
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:02.102]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who I respect, wrote an article yesterday for InfoWars and said, look, don't make it about Assange.
[02:12:02.202 --> 02:12:05.624]  Why is the media defending all these dishonest tactics by government?
[02:12:05.904 --> 02:12:07.384]  Have we lost our moral compass?
[02:12:07.404 --> 02:12:08.365]  And I tend to agree with him.
[02:12:09.325 --> 02:12:10.706]  Now, Wayne Madsen I respect.
[02:12:11.386 --> 02:12:12.627]  Webster Tarpley I respect.
[02:12:12.667 --> 02:12:15.448]  They turn out to be right about 99% of the time.
[02:12:15.848 --> 02:12:17.328]  They say it's all a fraud.
[02:12:17.969 --> 02:12:25.132]  But I wanted to get him up here to talk about these new developments and to really comment on the full spectrum, Wayne Madsen, that I just threw out there.
[02:12:25.172 --> 02:12:25.692]  What's your take?
[02:12:26.587 --> 02:12:28.629]  Well, I think this was bound to happen.
[02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:36.336]  Of course, I think the problem with Julian Assange is he had more than his Andy Warhol 15 minutes of fame.
[02:12:36.356 --> 02:12:42.421]  You know, he wanted to be in the media spotlight, and now he's paying the price for it.
[02:12:42.601 --> 02:12:52.951]  And yeah, I think it's this Anna Arden, this woman who, one of the women who brought the charges against him, the word is that she's tied up with Posada Carillas.
[02:12:53.891 --> 02:12:55.552]  He's a convicted bomber.
[02:12:55.793 --> 02:12:57.073]  Yeah, he's a bomber.
[02:12:57.614 --> 02:13:05.779]  He bombed a Cuban Airlines Boeing 707 in 1976 and flew from Bridgetown Barbados.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:14.605]  I was stationed in Barbados a year after that happened and I know that even the Navy base sent divers there to pick up bodies of children.
[02:13:14.665 --> 02:13:18.728]  So this is a nasty player and if he's hanging around people like that.
[02:13:19.708 --> 02:13:24.492]  Assange has hung around these kinds of iffy people in the past.
[02:13:24.532 --> 02:13:33.718]  Back during the first Gulf War, he was apparently associated with a group called the Chaos Computer Club, a bunch of hackers out of Hamburg, Germany.
[02:13:33.738 --> 02:13:39.022]  I sat in one meeting at the CIA headquarters on these guys hacking into U.S.
[02:13:39.062 --> 02:13:40.563]  Defense Department computers.
[02:13:41.083 --> 02:13:43.505]  Assange was part of that operation, apparently.
[02:13:44.905 --> 02:13:48.446]  But in those days, the Pentagon had no idea what was going on.
[02:13:49.547 --> 02:13:57.849]  Now they've got cyber command and they've got cyber security teams and offensive information warfare people.
[02:13:58.369 --> 02:14:00.910]  I think Assange has been overtaken by events.
[02:14:01.090 --> 02:14:08.372]  I think he was used, and as you say, now we have the predicted bills in Congress to extend.
[02:14:08.452 --> 02:14:11.853]  One of them says extend the Patriot Act to the Internet.
[02:14:12.964 --> 02:14:18.307]  That's right, I was scanning over these two new bills and it just is the complete end of the internet.
[02:14:18.768 --> 02:14:20.149]  I mean, just everything they want.
[02:14:20.509 --> 02:14:23.291]  Cyber security is already in place, now they just want to legalize it.
[02:14:24.751 --> 02:14:26.332]  They clearly set this guy up.
[02:14:26.393 --> 02:14:27.693]  I mean, he fits the M.O.
[02:14:28.314 --> 02:14:31.035]  of somebody and his lawyers told him to go turn themselves in.
[02:14:31.356 --> 02:14:32.857]  They're the ones Soros connected.
[02:14:32.877 --> 02:14:37.560]  I think he's going to be pretty freaked out when he realizes they're hanging him out to dry.
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:38.740]  He should be released.
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:39.321]  I mean, Wayne
[02:14:39.941 --> 02:14:51.006]  I mean, what, probably half the males in America or Europe would be going to jail if, I mean, I'd say half the men out there or more, you know, said, come on, baby, I don't want to wear a prophylactic.
[02:14:51.346 --> 02:14:52.387]  And then she's like, OK.
[02:14:52.707 --> 02:14:55.228]  And then now that's that's called molestation and rape.
[02:14:55.308 --> 02:14:57.089]  But of course it is.
[02:14:57.149 --> 02:14:59.570]  That's what the hardcore CIA feminists teach.
[02:15:00.552 --> 02:15:02.534]  Well, I kind of feel sorry for Saj.
[02:15:02.634 --> 02:15:12.302]  I mean, here's a guy, you know, he had his aviator sunglasses, he had all the different haircuts, and now, you know, now he's a guest of Scotland Yard.
[02:15:12.903 --> 02:15:15.785]  And now that he's in that system, he may not come out.
[02:15:15.805 --> 02:15:22.071]  You know, and I'm sure the Brits are now allowing the Americans to have access to him.
[02:15:22.451 --> 02:15:24.333]  I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case.
[02:15:25.173 --> 02:15:27.616]  Uh, but I think, you know, we have to look at the bigger picture.
[02:15:27.656 --> 02:15:33.302]  Like, one of these bills in Congress is, it has an earlier name called the SHIELD Law.
[02:15:33.683 --> 02:15:37.267]  That's not the kind of SHIELD Law we need to protect journalist sources.
[02:15:37.707 --> 02:15:40.090]  This is to shield, uh, U.S.
[02:15:40.190 --> 02:15:43.654]  intelligence contacts abroad from being named in the press.
[02:15:44.375 --> 02:16:05.446]  That would essentially shut me down because, you know, if there's a nasty player in Costa Rica where they're planning to launch another contra war against Nicaragua, I've named some of these characters in Costa Rica and Honduras as CIA operatives that I would go to jail if this law is signed.
[02:16:05.646 --> 02:16:11.969]  And I believe that President Obama has every intention of signing such legislation into law.
[02:16:12.702 --> 02:16:14.683]  So this is the Internet's 9-11.
[02:16:14.744 --> 02:16:19.787]  The Israelis admittedly launched the Stuxnet against Iran.
[02:16:19.847 --> 02:16:21.648]  Now we've got to give up our Internet because of that.
[02:16:22.489 --> 02:16:25.771]  The government runs the underwear bomber, and we're all lucky.
[02:16:25.831 --> 02:16:27.633]  I mean, they're just staging it right out in the open.
[02:16:27.973 --> 02:16:29.294]  Wayne, shifting gears briefly,
[02:16:29.634 --> 02:16:42.665]  What do you think of TSA now all over the streets of America sticking their hands in pants and groping, and now telescreens to be in Mall of America, 800 Walmarts, basically everywhere when they're done, with constant government messages.
[02:16:42.985 --> 02:16:45.467]  This is directly out of Stephen King's The Running Man.
[02:16:45.688 --> 02:16:46.809]  This is directly out of 1984.
[02:16:46.929 --> 02:16:56.917]  I mean, is Napolitano going to start wearing knee-high jackboots and walking around with a riding crop and maybe have a hot blonde
[02:16:57.217 --> 02:17:00.881]  Yeah, I don't know what Napolitano does with her girlfriend these days.
[02:17:00.901 --> 02:17:01.982]  But anyway, no, you're right.
[02:17:02.022 --> 02:17:06.707]  I think what we're seeing here, we all got suckered in on this open change nonsense.
[02:17:14.012 --> 02:17:18.578]  Um, which, you know, Obama was sold like a new form of Pepsi Cola.
[02:17:18.618 --> 02:17:21.862]  They even used the same logo as Pepsi.
[02:17:22.262 --> 02:17:24.565]  And now we're suffering the consequences.
[02:17:25.005 --> 02:17:31.493]  I think, look, I'm looking at the potential for maybe having to get out of here at some point.
[02:17:31.853 --> 02:17:33.154]  Wow, it's funny you say that.
[02:17:33.214 --> 02:17:49.004]  I was on 590 AM yesterday and I just had to talk to my wife on the phone and, you know, I've said I'll go down with the ship, but at a certain point, I mean, other countries are horrible, that's why I wouldn't leave, because it's a global government, but at a certain point, I mean, if they, telescreens and black uniforms, I mean...
[02:17:49.884 --> 02:17:51.666]  I mean, we may have to get out of here, Wayne.
[02:17:51.686 --> 02:17:54.069]  I mean, this sucker is going down faster than I thought.
[02:17:54.089 --> 02:17:55.931]  Yeah, I know.
[02:17:56.772 --> 02:18:01.718]  I mean, I thought at this point in my life I'd be looking at, you know, planning for retirement.
[02:18:01.778 --> 02:18:07.165]  Now, looking at political exile abroad, I mean, that's how bad it's got in this country.
[02:18:07.885 --> 02:18:12.066]  You know, I've seen it just go downhill and it's disgusting.
[02:18:12.486 --> 02:18:28.208]  And this new Congress, by the way, is not going to change anything because I understand that... Oh no, it's all going to be real conservative and O'Reilly's like, execute anybody that leaks anything and let's arrest anybody that videotapes cops.
[02:18:28.269 --> 02:18:30.989]  And the Republicans are like, yeah, get rid of the internet.
[02:18:31.109 --> 02:18:31.669]  I like it.
[02:18:31.909 --> 02:18:33.069]  Get rid of free speech.
[02:18:33.089 --> 02:18:36.790]  That's how we get tough on that fancy pants Assange.
[02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:43.680]  You know, the freshman Republican class has already been taken to the Heritage Foundation to be given their marching orders.
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:52.112]  So they're going to be caught up in that Republican crunching machine, and they're not going to... Whatever they said during the campaign, that's not what they're going to do when they're in...
[02:18:52.412 --> 02:18:55.273]  Just like Obama, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[02:18:55.313 --> 02:19:03.357]  And meanwhile, Boehner, excuse me, Boehner is trying to block Ron Paul from the committee chairmanship on that banking committee.
[02:19:03.717 --> 02:19:04.837]  I mean, it's just the budget.
[02:19:05.137 --> 02:19:07.538]  I mean, and Republicans are like, I like Boehner.
[02:19:07.558 --> 02:19:08.219]  I mean, they're just...
[02:19:08.939 --> 02:19:10.380]  Folks, you're going to get hurt real bad.
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:15.723]  For those of you out there that are still giggling and, you know, picking your nose and everything, you better get it through your head.
[02:19:15.983 --> 02:19:17.804]  This is real bona fide tyranny.
[02:19:17.824 --> 02:19:18.244]  You got it?
[02:19:18.545 --> 02:19:21.526]  And tyranny is aimed at the average schmo.
[02:19:21.846 --> 02:19:22.987]  They want your property.
[02:19:23.027 --> 02:19:23.888]  They want your money.
[02:19:23.928 --> 02:19:24.808]  They're going to take it all.
[02:19:25.028 --> 02:19:34.134]  I mean, Wayne, what do you make of the New York Times telling us how great it is that they're going to cut veterans' pay and pensions and make veterans get their own insurance?
[02:19:34.194 --> 02:19:35.374]  You're a veteran of the Navy.
[02:19:35.634 --> 02:19:38.076]  I mean, how brazen is that?
[02:19:38.576 --> 02:19:43.418]  Well, this is how they're gonna stick the veterans into the Obamacare myth.
[02:19:43.438 --> 02:19:44.618]  That's what I see, you know?
[02:19:45.099 --> 02:19:53.722]  And, you know, the veterans are gonna, basically, if every veteran applied for their benefits, it would break the Veterans Administration.
[02:19:53.742 --> 02:19:54.202]  Well, stay there.
[02:19:54.242 --> 02:19:55.403]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[02:19:55.423 --> 02:19:57.363]  Get more into WikiLeaks, where you see this going.
[02:19:57.903 --> 02:19:58.764]  This is disgusting.
[02:20:00.538 --> 02:20:01.479]  Go solar for cheap!
[02:20:01.719 --> 02:20:03.860]  Want to use solar power but the price is too high?

[02:20:19.769 --> 02:20:22.351]  Reduce your foreign oil dependency when you go green with 123cheapsolar.com.
[02:20:29.915 --> 02:20:39.181]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:39.241 --> 02:20:46.186]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:46.326 --> 02:20:47.147]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:20:47.187 --> 02:20:50.289]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:20:50.449 --> 02:20:51.209]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:20:51.229 --> 02:20:52.290]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:20:52.450 --> 02:20:52.930]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:52.970 --> 02:20:53.251]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:00.215 --> 02:21:05.100]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:05.980]  What have we got?
[02:21:06.201 --> 02:21:08.322]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:08.643 --> 02:21:09.383]  A republic.
[02:21:09.644 --> 02:21:12.226]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:12.306 --> 02:21:14.208]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:14.568 --> 02:21:16.490]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:17.871]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:18.271 --> 02:21:19.392]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:19.592 --> 02:21:19.993]  Children?
[02:21:20.193 --> 02:21:20.994]  Our education?
[02:21:21.314 --> 02:21:21.954]  Our money?
[02:21:22.155 --> 02:21:25.798]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:26.158 --> 02:21:30.784]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:31.124 --> 02:21:31.945]  We have the facts.
[02:21:32.145 --> 02:21:33.266]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:33.327 --> 02:21:34.188]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:34.228 --> 02:21:35.069]  We have common law.
[02:21:35.109 --> 02:21:37.371]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:37.632 --> 02:21:41.416]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:41.516 --> 02:21:46.299]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:47.861]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:47.961 --> 02:21:48.801]  Don't tread on me.
[02:21:49.061 --> 02:21:55.466]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:22:00.549 --> 02:22:03.672]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[02:22:03.893 --> 02:22:11.141]  When all hell breaks loose, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[02:22:11.881 --> 02:22:14.604]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[02:22:14.985 --> 02:22:17.227]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[02:22:17.527 --> 02:22:20.631]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.

[02:22:34.602 --> 02:22:37.985]  The Survival Sprout Bank is a complete kit with nothing else to buy.
[02:22:38.205 --> 02:22:42.488]  And with sprouts so easy to grow, even children can grow emergency food.

[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:02.662]  Calling all manufacturers from across the United States.
[02:23:03.063 --> 02:23:09.127]  Are you eager to have people buy your products right here at home instead of having them buy competing products made on the other side of the world?
[02:23:09.368 --> 02:23:13.551]  Do you want to build your business while helping boost our nation's economy at the same time?

[02:24:11.853 --> 02:24:13.294]  Is it getting better?
[02:24:16.717 --> 02:24:18.459]  Or do you feel the same?
[02:24:19.162 --> 02:24:21.565]  I said cops at the FCC was the chairman.
[02:24:21.845 --> 02:24:22.566]  I know it's not.
[02:24:22.586 --> 02:24:24.428]  He's the commissioner.
[02:24:26.370 --> 02:24:27.311]  He is a commissioner.
[02:24:27.771 --> 02:24:28.152]  Whatever.
[02:24:28.212 --> 02:24:31.035]  One of the heads of the FCC openly saying shut down our free speech.
[02:24:31.075 --> 02:24:31.776]  I've had enough of it.
[02:24:32.116 --> 02:24:33.457]  Going back to Wayne Madsen.
[02:24:34.619 --> 02:24:37.622]  Wayne, in closing, other thoughts on WikiLeaks?
[02:24:38.888 --> 02:24:41.951]  Drudge is reporting that he's going to be man of the year, person of the year.
[02:24:42.732 --> 02:24:45.854]  And they're going to really use him, I guess, as the Internet Bin Laden.
[02:24:46.275 --> 02:24:48.417]  But he has a face like, I guess, the West.
[02:24:48.937 --> 02:24:50.219]  And so here we go.
[02:24:50.259 --> 02:24:51.500]  I mean, this is horrible.
[02:24:52.253 --> 02:25:02.618]  Well, you know, the other thing I find interesting is that we've got a leak of State Department cables that have shown up on a Lebanese newspaper's website, Al-Akbar, that apparently are not public e-leaks.
[02:25:02.658 --> 02:25:09.822]  But we may have another source, which I think tends to take the attention off of this Private First Class Manning.
[02:25:09.862 --> 02:25:11.223]  I don't think he was the guy.
[02:25:11.243 --> 02:25:13.224]  If we've got another source,
[02:25:14.065 --> 02:25:18.609]  Outside of WikiLeaks, as far as I'm concerned, I think that exonerates them.
[02:25:18.629 --> 02:25:19.430]  Well, there's no way.
[02:25:19.450 --> 02:25:23.415]  I mean, you worked at the NSA and of course in the Naval Data Command as well.
[02:25:23.735 --> 02:25:26.258]  You know they don't just have everything in one spot like this.
[02:25:26.858 --> 02:25:27.379]  No, no.
[02:25:27.419 --> 02:25:35.588]  And it would trigger all kinds of audit alarms if that much information was being accessed, but then on top of that being copied.
[02:25:36.553 --> 02:25:46.535]  Okay, expanding on that, he's talking about this doomsday code that he's got to release, the motherlode that will reportedly dwarf what we've even seen so far.
[02:25:47.276 --> 02:25:56.318]  But you said six months ago or more that he would start going after George Soros' enemies, and now, sure enough, he's going after financial institutions.
[02:25:56.909 --> 02:25:59.772]  Yeah, Bank of America, apparently, maybe a couple other banks.
[02:25:59.832 --> 02:26:04.357]  The first one was a Swiss bank called Julius Baer.
[02:26:04.477 --> 02:26:12.905]  Even after then, their stock plummeted and it became like a hostile takeover by none other than Mr. Soros.
[02:26:13.005 --> 02:26:16.369]  So, we've seen him play games with Soros before.
[02:26:17.229 --> 02:26:27.553]  I really think Assange was in this way over his head and now he's found out the hard way what it's like to deal with these kinds of people.
[02:26:28.053 --> 02:26:46.060]  Apparently he was co-opted after the work he did with the Chaos Computer Club in the early 90s and he's been working with these people ever since and now he's found out that sometimes they don't let the spies come in from the cold, they leave them out there to dry.
[02:26:46.485 --> 02:26:49.827]  Well, they always pick a type like him to flush down the toilet.
[02:26:50.747 --> 02:26:57.711]  I mean, people that work for this system, it's just like Bush admits in all these books and stuff that he ordered torture.
[02:26:58.131 --> 02:27:06.216]  But when it all came out about the torture, we had the White House memos ordering it, saying it's not illegal when the President orders it from John Yoo and Alberto Gonzalez.
[02:27:07.677 --> 02:27:15.546]  They sent a bunch of people to prison that followed orders who were still in prison, Wayne, as you know, but Bush can hop around admitting he ordered it.
[02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:18.670]  I mean, it's the same thing with Assange.
[02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:24.237]  People who work for this group need to under... Why do the globalists love to flush their own people down the toilet?
[02:27:24.913 --> 02:27:25.674]  Oh, they're useful.
[02:27:25.694 --> 02:27:27.575]  They're just, they're throwaway items.
[02:27:27.615 --> 02:27:29.056]  We've seen it time and time again.
[02:27:29.496 --> 02:27:33.780]  Whether there's a guy like Assange, or there's somebody like Manuel Noriega, or Saddam Hussein.
[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:41.045]  They're just, you know, rolled up like an old piece of toilet paper and put aside.
[02:27:41.085 --> 02:27:42.946]  That's what we've seen it time and time again.
[02:27:43.166 --> 02:27:45.748]  What do the globalists think of somebody like you or I?
[02:27:46.289 --> 02:27:49.771]  People that really are legitimately fighting the global corrupt system.
[02:27:49.791 --> 02:27:50.712]  I mean, what do they think of us?
[02:27:51.229 --> 02:27:51.730]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:27:51.770 --> 02:27:56.935]  I guess, you know, when you go from being an annoyance to being a problem, I guess they left the ante on you.
[02:27:56.995 --> 02:28:01.060]  So, that's why I'm always looking behind me.
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:04.524]  I look both ways before I cross the street.
[02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:09.401]  Well, I'm seeing America really start to wake up.
[02:28:09.421 --> 02:28:17.123]  I mean, I talked about the YouTube videos put out by Homeland Security and every comment, and I've spent a lot of time reading hundreds of them last night and today.
[02:28:17.664 --> 02:28:29.948]  I couldn't find anybody that agreed with telescreens at Walmart, and they were all very thought-provoking and showed a full-spectrum understanding of the public of what's really happening here.
[02:28:29.968 --> 02:28:31.028]  I mean, is that not encouraging?
[02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:39.056]  Well, we've got Janet Napolitano doing audio messages on DC subway and Metrobus.
[02:28:39.196 --> 02:28:44.620]  Basically said, if you see something suspicious, report it immediately.
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:46.862]  So we've already had a taste of that here in Washington.
[02:28:46.902 --> 02:28:49.164]  So they're turning all of America into one big airport?
[02:28:49.824 --> 02:28:50.485]  Absolutely.
[02:28:51.245 --> 02:28:54.188]  But I mean, the good news is that no one's buying it that I've talked to.
[02:28:55.494 --> 02:28:56.415]  Uh, I hope not.
[02:28:56.535 --> 02:29:02.820]  I mean, you know, the question of when was it the proper time to get out of Nazi Germany?
[02:29:02.881 --> 02:29:03.941]  Was it 34, 35, 36?
[02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:06.704]  It was too long.
[02:29:07.044 --> 02:29:07.745]  It was too late.
[02:29:07.765 --> 02:29:10.807]  So I think that's the... So you're really... I mean, sure, you're walking around.
[02:29:10.847 --> 02:29:13.009]  There's announcements of watch out for terrorists.
[02:29:13.329 --> 02:29:15.491]  This message is brought to you by Homeland Security.
[02:29:15.811 --> 02:29:22.237]  I mean, it is super... It's like they watched a B-movie about a nightmare police state and are copying it.
[02:29:22.978 --> 02:29:28.503]  Ray, it's like Gattaca rolled a blade and a few of those other enemies of the state all rolled up in the run.
[02:29:28.543 --> 02:29:28.783]  You bet.
[02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:53.550]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.493 --> 02:29:57.161]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:59.639 --> 02:32:03.602]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:03.842 --> 02:32:09.866]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:10.246 --> 02:32:17.331]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:17.632 --> 02:32:22.175]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:32:31.169 --> 02:32:34.896]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:35.410 --> 02:32:41.592]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:42.172 --> 02:32:45.593]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:32:52.434 --> 02:32:53.235]  Thank you.
[02:33:03.325 --> 02:33:04.026]  Big Brother.
[02:33:04.327 --> 02:33:05.588]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:05.989 --> 02:33:07.131]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:07.371 --> 02:33:08.333]  You want answers?
[02:33:08.633 --> 02:33:09.735]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:10.716 --> 02:33:14.462]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:18.697 --> 02:33:22.638]  You know, you can cut the benefits and the health care of veterans all day.
[02:33:22.698 --> 02:33:24.999]  You can freeze Social Security.
[02:33:25.019 --> 02:33:26.039]  You can raise taxes.
[02:33:26.739 --> 02:33:31.020]  We're never going to get out of debt, because the bankers don't want us to get out of debt, until they go to prison.
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:32.741]  The big mega banks, not your local bank.
[02:33:33.261 --> 02:33:39.883]  Until we write off the thousands of trillions of made-up, made-off type scam money.
[02:33:40.805 --> 02:33:41.665]  And that's the issue.
[02:33:41.705 --> 02:33:44.206]  This is designed to destroy our economy.
[02:33:44.646 --> 02:33:51.608]  I want to get into the economy and Obama's little press release in the press conference he's giving right now about tax cuts.
[02:33:53.008 --> 02:33:54.109]  That is coming up.
[02:33:55.049 --> 02:34:00.250]  But first, I wanted to play a short little video that was made three months ago.
[02:34:00.991 --> 02:34:04.271]  And you'll notice when the video was made, silver was $22 an ounce.
[02:34:04.672 --> 02:34:05.372]  Now it's above $30.
[02:34:07.281 --> 02:34:13.562]  They'll probably go back down a few dollars, but then surge back up even more if you follow the trends, if you follow the graphs.
[02:34:13.982 --> 02:34:16.483]  Overall, it's going straight up because of dollar devaluation.
[02:34:17.583 --> 02:34:24.384]  But I wanted to play this video that I think really illustrates what's happening and what's unfolding.
[02:34:24.424 --> 02:34:26.705]  It's called the Silver Perspective.
[02:34:27.105 --> 02:34:33.246]  But remember, the equations they're giving you here in this little three-minute video is dealing with silver at about $22 an ounce.
[02:34:33.606 --> 02:34:34.767]  It's already above $30.
[02:34:34.807 --> 02:34:36.387]  So here it is.
[02:34:42.538 --> 02:34:51.700]  There is great excitement in the precious metals world as the mainstream media trumpets gold's rise to an all-time high and silver's vault to a 30-year high.
[02:34:52.141 --> 02:34:58.282]  So as excitement and public awareness of precious metals builds, how do we keep perspective on our own holdings?
[02:34:58.822 --> 02:35:05.884]  And how can a new silver investor make an informed decision to buy physical silver for the first time at today's prices?
[02:35:06.604 --> 02:35:08.945]  How valuable is one ounce of silver?
[02:35:11.363 --> 02:35:20.789]  The mainstream media constantly touts silver's all-time high as being $50 an ounce, which was reached in 1980 when the Hunt brothers cornered the silver market.
[02:35:21.210 --> 02:35:24.212]  So, how much money was $50 in 1980?
[02:35:24.932 --> 02:35:36.100]  Well, a movie ticket cost about $2.50, a first-class stamp cost $0.15, and a gallon of gas was $1.25, while the median household income in the United States was $17,700.
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:37.520]  So, inflation means everything.
[02:35:41.523 --> 02:35:45.287]  Accounting for inflation is key when discussing silver.
[02:35:45.687 --> 02:35:50.893]  With that perspective, let's go back to the much-discussed $50 all-time high for silver.
[02:35:51.273 --> 02:35:58.841]  In today's dollars, the real all-time high for silver when adjusting for inflation is $138 an ounce.
[02:35:59.161 --> 02:36:02.985]  This, according to Eric King and esteemed economist John Williams.
[02:36:03.545 --> 02:36:09.208]  Just as a movie ticket in 1980 was $2.50, today a movie ticket is pushing $10.
[02:36:10.348 --> 02:36:16.751]  So, too, the inflation-adjusted all-time high in silver is much higher than the oft-reported $50 an ounce.
[02:36:17.092 --> 02:36:19.173]  At today's silver price of approximately $21.50,
[02:36:20.413 --> 02:36:24.837]  Silver is 57% below its 1980 high of $50.
[02:36:25.277 --> 02:36:34.764]  However, at $21.50 an ounce, silver is 85.5% below its inflation-adjusted all-time high of $138 an ounce.
[02:36:35.045 --> 02:36:41.410]  No wonder billionaire investor Jim Rogers often states that silver is still 85% below its high.
[02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:46.594]  To keep our perspective on the tremendous opportunity silver currently offers investors,
[02:36:47.014 --> 02:36:53.038]  We must remember, in 1980, when silver reached $50 per ounce, there was no derivatives bubble.
[02:36:53.338 --> 02:36:56.340]  There was no concern of fiat dollars flooding the world.
[02:36:56.580 --> 02:36:59.842]  There was no multi-trillion dollar bailouts of Wall Street banks.
[02:37:00.282 --> 02:37:06.486]  And most importantly, there was no proven 100-to-1 paper manipulation of gold and silver markets.
[02:37:06.846 --> 02:37:15.492]  Precious metals are financial assets, and like currencies and T-bills and T-bonds, they trade in the multiples of a hundred times the underlying physical.
[02:37:15.772 --> 02:37:19.534]  They trade in the multiples of a hundred times the underlying physical.
[02:37:19.935 --> 02:37:23.297]  Silver is such an undervalued bargain, it defies belief.
[02:37:23.617 --> 02:37:28.580]  Until you come to understand that the banks have suppressed the price with paper shorts and paper silver.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.142]  Then, it makes perfect sense.
[02:37:31.662 --> 02:37:35.704]  At this very moment, we are living through dramatic historical events.
[02:37:36.085 --> 02:37:41.287]  Both gold and silver are now breaking the bonds of the manipulation that has long suppressed them.
[02:37:41.688 --> 02:37:48.011]  And silver trading in lockstep with gold is returning to its 5,000-year history as a monetary metal.
[02:37:48.471 --> 02:37:51.333]  The gains investors have made to date have been stunning.
[02:37:51.673 --> 02:38:04.153]  But as the bankers are forced to cover their short positions and the true value of these precious metals is once again rediscovered, the pricing moves for gold and silver that lie in the years ahead will be talked about for generations.
[02:38:08.044 --> 02:38:13.267]  All right, that's the Silver Perspective by SGTBolo7 on YouTube.
[02:38:13.428 --> 02:38:15.349]  Excellent videos on that channel.
[02:38:15.409 --> 02:38:20.292]  Max Keiser's coming up in about three minutes because silver has risen again.
[02:38:20.312 --> 02:38:26.016]  And I've had major newspapers, magazines, TV networks calling me.
[02:38:26.756 --> 02:38:31.999]  Saying so, you and Max Keiser did this, and I certainly don't deserve much of the credit.
[02:38:32.039 --> 02:38:34.460]  My audience does, to a certain extent.
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:38.642]  Keiser jumped on a bandwagon already going by grassroots people.
[02:38:38.682 --> 02:38:39.483]  He pointed that out.
[02:38:39.743 --> 02:38:40.924]  He did supercharge it.
[02:38:41.864 --> 02:38:47.007]  But I'm not even sure we're having the overall or even a minority effect on silver going up.
[02:38:47.387 --> 02:38:49.048]  It's the dollar devaluation.
[02:38:49.068 --> 02:38:56.732]  It's the Chinese upping their holdings of gold fivefold, according to the Financial Times, doubling their acceleration of purchasing silver.
[02:38:57.693 --> 02:38:58.253]  You know, we hear about
[02:38:58.653 --> 02:38:59.954]  Euro down, dollar up.
[02:39:00.014 --> 02:39:02.295]  Now today, euro up, dollar down.
[02:39:02.736 --> 02:39:04.477]  It's all the same big global banks.
[02:39:04.877 --> 02:39:06.738]  They just run one up, one run down.
[02:39:06.778 --> 02:39:10.381]  But overall, the currencies are being devalued and commodities are going up.
[02:39:10.461 --> 02:39:12.422]  I mean, it's a very simple equation.
[02:39:12.462 --> 02:39:13.322]  Here's Market Watch.
[02:39:13.783 --> 02:39:14.103]  U.S.
[02:39:14.143 --> 02:39:16.945]  dollar slips versus euro as uncertainties ease.
[02:39:17.485 --> 02:39:18.446]  And then it'll be the U.S.
[02:39:18.466 --> 02:39:19.106]  that goes down.
[02:39:19.126 --> 02:39:20.387]  Then it'll be the euro that goes down.
[02:39:20.667 --> 02:39:23.129]  Then they'll both go back up a little and then down even more.
[02:39:23.769 --> 02:39:25.210]  They're going down incrementally.
[02:39:25.371 --> 02:39:26.932]  Gold and silver going up incrementally.
[02:39:27.472 --> 02:39:31.977]  Look at the long-term ten-year, five-year, one-year graphs, not the weekly graphs.
[02:39:32.017 --> 02:39:33.658]  Gold's down a few bucks today.
[02:39:33.738 --> 02:39:37.982]  Silver, last time I checked, is still up to near record highs, over 30 bucks.
[02:39:38.002 --> 02:39:40.585]  But we'll get the latest from Ted Anderson here briefly.
[02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:42.667]  Comics, gold is higher.
[02:39:42.687 --> 02:39:44.969]  Hits new record high on solid investor demand.
[02:39:46.030 --> 02:39:47.651]  So that's ongoing today where the
[02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:52.226]  Futures are up, but the goal a few hours ago was down.
[02:39:52.246 --> 02:39:53.368]  I've got to talk to Ted in a minute.
[02:39:54.029 --> 02:39:55.391]  So we've got some of that news here.
[02:39:56.745 --> 02:40:05.267]  Also, oil surges above $90 a barrel, and they're talking about over $3 an average soon in the country.
[02:40:05.667 --> 02:40:07.408]  So that inflation is starting to kick back in.
[02:40:07.448 --> 02:40:12.449]  And notice, gas is $1.50 a gallon five, six, seven years ago.
[02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:17.071]  It goes up to $3, you get angry, goes down to $2, you feel like you're getting a good deal, goes to $3.50, goes back to $2.50.
[02:40:19.079 --> 02:40:20.440]  That's psychological warfare.
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:22.362]  Then it goes to $5 and it goes down to $3.
[02:40:23.043 --> 02:40:25.084]  Then it goes to $6 and it goes down to $5.
[02:40:25.445 --> 02:40:29.168]  And you're incrementally accepting the inflation.
[02:40:29.588 --> 02:40:32.611]  Let's briefly go to Ted Anderson and then to Max Keiser.
[02:40:33.312 --> 02:40:37.956]  Ted, give us the latest on gold and silver prices right now and what you're watching in the market.
[02:40:38.888 --> 02:40:43.271]  Well, right now, silver had gone up just incredibly today, Alex.
[02:40:43.331 --> 02:40:46.293]  I mean, $30.73 at the peak.
[02:40:46.473 --> 02:40:46.733]  Wow.
[02:40:47.454 --> 02:40:53.978]  I mean, when I seen silver hit $30.10, I was like, whoa, just like broke through $30 like nobody's business.
[02:40:54.298 --> 02:40:56.240]  Now we're almost at $31 an ounce.
[02:40:56.580 --> 02:41:00.022]  Gold hit a high today, too, of $1,432.50.
[02:41:00.522 --> 02:41:04.225]  A little bit of profit-taking later on in the day, but the markets aren't closed yet.
[02:41:04.605 --> 02:41:08.108]  But if you want to be getting in on silver or gold, man, I tell you, Alex,
[02:41:09.128 --> 02:41:15.149]  At $97 for three-a-year videos and three silver dollars, that isn't going to last very long.
[02:41:15.169 --> 02:41:17.910]  Man, I cannot hold it at that price.
[02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:21.971]  That price has got to go up over $100 for that same deal.
[02:41:22.471 --> 02:41:25.291]  And I'm holding it because I want people to get your videos.
[02:41:25.771 --> 02:41:29.652]  And what an attractive buy now, three silver dollars like that.
[02:41:30.112 --> 02:41:33.113]  I mean, you just can't, I don't think you can beat that anywhere.
[02:41:33.733 --> 02:42:00.742]  uh... and not at ninety seven dollars and this is delivered to with your videos i mean that the the the the other thing that i'm holding back in price which is also going to increase and it's just a matter of time and i have to go out and buy the darn stuff uh... are those walking liberty haves at twelve eighty four i mean that is such a great buy and and and the other thing that i added to the mix we're talking about less than twenty six dollars for an ounce of silver when silver is at
[02:42:01.682 --> 02:42:05.566]  Over 30, so folks cannot find that anywhere else at that price.
[02:42:06.468 --> 02:42:10.890]  Yeah, right now at this particular time, that Walking Liberty is going to increase in price.
[02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:14.191]  So is this the last day because you've been holding it over?
[02:42:14.531 --> 02:42:17.893]  Well, you know Alex, I want people to get silver, honestly.
[02:42:17.973 --> 02:42:20.734]  I mean, that's why I have that video priced down too.
[02:42:20.894 --> 02:42:26.476]  We also have what I call the Survival Pack, which is 1,000 dimes.
[02:42:26.536 --> 02:42:31.898]  I mean, a dime is a small fraction of silver, and you can use that to spend anywhere you need to.
[02:42:31.998 --> 02:42:33.379]  Yeah, these are the pre-what, 66 dimes?
[02:42:33.399 --> 02:42:33.619]  No, pre-1964.
[02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:37.481]  Yeah.
[02:42:37.501 --> 02:42:40.464]  And that is also just another reason, another buy.
[02:42:40.664 --> 02:42:42.626]  And how much can you cash one of those in for?
[02:42:42.966 --> 02:42:45.508]  Well, the dimes are worth about 21 cents a piece.
[02:42:45.528 --> 02:42:49.412]  So, I mean, that gives you an idea of what the value is there.
[02:42:49.452 --> 02:42:54.396]  I mean, it's just a great way to be getting involved in the silver market.
[02:42:54.416 --> 02:42:56.358]  And you can find them right on your website.
[02:42:56.578 --> 02:42:57.178]  We're almost out of time.
[02:42:57.198 --> 02:42:58.259]  I've got to go to Max Keiser.
[02:42:58.299 --> 02:43:02.921]  Ted and Ted, the owner of Genesis and Minus Resources, the best deals out there.
[02:43:02.941 --> 02:43:07.122]  You're going to find these radio... I mean, his regular deals are great, but these radio specials... I mean, just do the math.
[02:43:07.162 --> 02:43:11.304]  These are absolutely incredible deals, and he's got it there on hand.
[02:43:11.344 --> 02:43:15.165]  Almost everybody else has run out weeks ago or has huge premiums.
[02:43:15.506 --> 02:43:17.366]  Ted's got great deals on gold and silver.
[02:43:17.406 --> 02:43:20.748]  Just ask them for the list of radio specials in gold and silver.
[02:43:20.768 --> 02:43:21.088]  800-686-2237.
[02:43:21.108 --> 02:43:21.148]  800-686-2237.
[02:43:28.571 --> 02:43:36.657]  Yeah, thanks a lot for having me up, Alex.
[02:43:36.737 --> 02:43:37.037]  You bet.
[02:43:37.077 --> 02:43:37.458]  Amazing.
[02:43:37.838 --> 02:43:46.724]  I wanted to briefly today bring up Max Keiser because Max has really been promoting the fact, of course, the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange System.
[02:43:49.326 --> 02:43:54.069]  Journalist with the BBC and RT, you name it, MaxKaiser.com.
[02:43:54.670 --> 02:44:01.574]  Obviously, for those that don't know, I just want to let you in on the fact he's been flogging the idea of buy silver, crash JP Morgan.
[02:44:01.914 --> 02:44:09.940]  I know he's a big supporter of the Gold Antitrust Committee, but Gata's treasurer put out a little article a few days ago saying, look, what Max is doing is positive.
[02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:11.141]  It'll show that
[02:44:11.741 --> 02:44:18.043]  They're manipulating the silver market down, it'll probably drive it up, but JP Morgan can cover this.
[02:44:18.423 --> 02:44:23.225]  So I wanted to get your response to that article and see if you disagree with them.
[02:44:24.446 --> 02:44:26.727]  Yeah, cover it with what?
[02:44:27.567 --> 02:44:28.807]  What are they going to cover that with?
[02:44:29.227 --> 02:44:31.368]  Well, most of the market they say is covered in cash.
[02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:38.611]  Yeah, so if they increase the cash supply to cover their liabilities, what happens to the value of the cash?
[02:44:39.417 --> 02:44:44.178]  Yeah, but we're talking about trillions of cash being pumped out a month, so $3.5 billion pumped out.
[02:44:44.198 --> 02:44:45.679]  I mean, I'm not poo-pooing what you're saying.
[02:44:46.019 --> 02:44:48.139]  I'm just throwing it out there that overall it's positive.
[02:44:48.159 --> 02:44:49.240]  No, I'm not talking about $3.5 billion.
[02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:57.662]  Listen, look, the over-the-counter silver market published by the Bank of International Settlements is $200 billion.
[02:44:58.102 --> 02:45:00.983]  It's dedicated over-the-counter short silver contracts.
[02:45:01.323 --> 02:45:01.723]  J.P.
[02:45:01.763 --> 02:45:02.904]  Morgan is half of that.
[02:45:03.084 --> 02:45:04.184]  That's $100 billion.
[02:45:04.224 --> 02:45:06.425]  That's 3.3 billion ounces of silver.
[02:45:06.465 --> 02:45:07.165]  They are short.
[02:45:07.865 --> 02:45:09.608]  Every dollar, silver goes up.
[02:45:09.628 --> 02:45:10.629]  Every dollar, silver goes up.
[02:45:10.649 --> 02:45:11.811]  Every dollar, silver goes up.
[02:45:24.574 --> 02:45:25.775]  Every dollar for silver.
[02:45:26.135 --> 02:45:28.037]  Silver goes up $10.
[02:45:28.317 --> 02:45:30.419]  That's $33 billion to JPMorgan.
[02:45:30.579 --> 02:45:32.800]  Their whole market cap's $150 billion.
[02:45:32.981 --> 02:45:40.046]  Okay, so you're saying, and I guess that would mean that that Gata article is wrong because they're only looking at the $3 billion or so.
[02:45:40.586 --> 02:45:41.267]  Please continue.
[02:45:41.823 --> 02:45:50.525]  Well, I talked with Chris Powell of GATA about this, and a couple of other people have made a comment that JP Morgan would bail out.
[02:45:50.885 --> 02:45:51.745]  They bailed out with what?
[02:45:51.845 --> 02:45:52.065]  U.S.
[02:45:52.105 --> 02:45:52.546]  dollars!
[02:45:53.126 --> 02:45:57.787]  If you keep bailing, what's happening to this, to the dollars becoming diluted?
[02:45:57.807 --> 02:45:59.327]  Why are people buying gold and silver?
[02:45:59.567 --> 02:46:00.287]  Because the U.S.
[02:46:00.327 --> 02:46:01.948]  keeps bailing out banks.
[02:46:02.028 --> 02:46:06.829]  Well, just to be clear, Max, I had you on to promote this, and I think you're a great guy.
[02:46:06.849 --> 02:46:09.910]  I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just injecting debate into this.
[02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:10.510]  Please continue.
[02:46:11.365 --> 02:46:14.250]  No, I'm just pointing out the obvious.
[02:46:14.370 --> 02:46:23.263]  If you cover your short with paper money, the value of that money is debased even more.
[02:46:23.544 --> 02:46:26.629]  Well, it certainly exposes that they're suppressing the price of silver.
[02:46:29.614 --> 02:46:30.755]  Why is the price going up?
[02:46:30.795 --> 02:46:35.616]  Because everybody around the world is buying gold and silver, in particular silver.
[02:46:35.856 --> 02:46:40.898]  Since I was on your show when we started this Google bomb three and a half weeks ago, it's up 11%.
[02:46:40.938 --> 02:46:42.259]  That's an annualized return of over 100%.
[02:46:42.499 --> 02:46:43.939]  It was up earlier today 13% from when I was on your show.
[02:46:50.237 --> 02:47:09.422]  So, this idea that you've got GATT, a gold anti-trust action committee, simultaneously working to expose the short to the civil market, and then kind of hedging themselves a bit, saying that, well, we are trying to, you know, JPMorgan and HSBC are now the subject of an investigation for manipulating the market.
[02:47:09.862 --> 02:47:13.865]  As part of a lot of the work from Gata and Ted Butler and all the work that's been done.
[02:47:14.225 --> 02:47:19.068]  And now there's an open investigation for manipulating the silver market.
[02:47:19.628 --> 02:47:24.251]  And so he, I think, is fearful of a collapsed banking system.
[02:47:24.531 --> 02:47:30.415]  He's expressed to me privately that he's afraid that if this thing takes off that banks around the world will collapse.
[02:47:30.755 --> 02:47:31.876]  He's fearful of that.
[02:47:32.176 --> 02:47:36.159]  And my point is... Well, the banks are collapsing our society, so you know what?
[02:47:36.199 --> 02:47:37.219]  They want to take me down?
[02:47:37.279 --> 02:47:38.340]  I'll take them down with me.
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:39.561]  Well, that's my point.
[02:47:39.701 --> 02:47:41.122]  We're going to go down anyway.
[02:47:41.482 --> 02:47:45.445]  So, I mean, so, Chris Powell at GATT is trying to have his, you know, cake and eat it too.
[02:47:45.485 --> 02:47:49.548]  He wants to expose the fraudsters, but he doesn't want too much damage to the banking system.
[02:47:49.848 --> 02:47:56.853]  My point is that we've got to take down these banking cartels because they are holding us hostage.
[02:47:56.873 --> 02:48:00.295]  Yeah, we've got to get on the offense, and you know what?
[02:48:00.355 --> 02:48:01.856]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:48:03.357 --> 02:48:05.278]  And the people are buying this thing all over the world.
[02:48:05.358 --> 02:48:06.859]  As you see, the thing has gone viral.
[02:48:06.879 --> 02:48:10.461]  We launched it on your show with the Google bomb on the 11th of November.
[02:48:10.862 --> 02:48:12.062]  The silver is climbing.
[02:48:13.223 --> 02:48:15.585]  I'll do a press release with you.
[02:48:15.605 --> 02:48:17.226]  The company hasn't released it yet.
[02:48:17.466 --> 02:48:21.248]  There's a company in the Pacific Northwest that's going to market.
[02:48:21.789 --> 02:48:24.330]  They put an initial order in for 10,000 pure silver coins.
[02:48:27.272 --> 02:48:32.476]  Well, you should just tell all the silver coin stampers to go with, buy silver, crash JP Morgan.
[02:48:55.230 --> 02:48:55.510]  I have.
[02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:58.972]  I've released my name and image for anyone to go forward with a campaign like this.
[02:48:59.052 --> 02:49:05.175]  I just got an email from a group in Poland that's now using this campaign as part of their thing.
[02:49:05.215 --> 02:49:11.459]  And I said, look, we've all got to be in this together, but I have no tie to these things at all economically.
[02:49:11.479 --> 02:49:24.606]  Well, if this is successful, which it looks like it's starting to be, nothing succeeds like success, it's pretty scary that this radio show would be the Cape Canaveral launch pad to fire Max Keiser into the heart of the New World Order.
[02:49:25.347 --> 02:49:50.077]  Right, and to crush JP Morgan, and I want to bring up an interesting point, actually, Stacey, who's got really good contacts in London, where Julian Assange is currently located, she was talking to her contacts over there, she's very close with the people over at the Frontline Club, which is the premier journalist club in London, and they know Julian very well, they know what's going on, she has great contacts, and she was pointing out to me something very, very interesting.
[02:49:50.297 --> 02:49:53.438]  You know, basically, the banks lynched
[02:49:54.085 --> 02:50:01.528]  Julian Assange, when they cut off his Visa card, his MasterCard, his PayPal account, we've seen here the first example of an electronic banking lynching.
[02:50:01.888 --> 02:50:02.489]  They lynched him.
[02:50:02.509 --> 02:50:03.709]  They pushed him completely off the grid.
[02:50:03.729 --> 02:50:05.790]  No, it shows the global control grid.
[02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:07.511]  Please continue.
[02:50:07.951 --> 02:50:09.592]  Yeah, that's exactly what it does show.
[02:50:10.332 --> 02:50:14.874]  Any of these credit card companies, they don't have to go through the rule of law or legal system at all.
[02:50:14.914 --> 02:50:16.274]  They just take you off the grid.
[02:50:16.554 --> 02:50:20.076]  MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, they simply said, you're no longer on the grid.
[02:50:20.860 --> 02:50:26.425]  And this is why today, and this is what the talk in London is today, today we're seeing relative strength in the dollar.
[02:50:26.726 --> 02:50:37.536]  Because today, for the paper cartel, for the plastic pushers, the Visa, the MasterCard, the debt pushers, this was a victory today, to put Julian Assange in front of the Magistrate.
[02:50:37.576 --> 02:50:43.841]  And he's going to jail because a feminist didn't like the fact that he had sex with her afterwards because she was jilted.
[02:50:44.602 --> 02:50:52.089]  I mean, so now in Europe, you go to jail if a woman has consensual sex with you and she's a feminist because they consider all sex rape.
[02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:53.650]  Boy, I tell you.
[02:50:54.751 --> 02:50:55.512]  These are liberals.
[02:50:55.552 --> 02:50:56.393]  Keep me away from them.
[02:50:57.334 --> 02:50:58.375]  Max Keiser, stay there.
[02:51:00.404 --> 02:51:02.725]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:51:02.785 --> 02:51:05.006]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:51:05.106 --> 02:51:08.288]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:51:08.328 --> 02:51:13.071]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:51:13.431 --> 02:51:17.613]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:51:17.933 --> 02:51:20.277]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:51:20.297 --> 02:51:22.821]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:51:23.161 --> 02:51:25.745]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:51:26.085 --> 02:51:33.697]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:51:34.011 --> 02:51:39.276]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:51:39.416 --> 02:51:42.219]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:51:42.259 --> 02:51:45.702]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:51:45.943 --> 02:51:46.864]  And I got news for you.
[02:51:47.024 --> 02:51:48.325]  You're everyone else.
[02:51:48.365 --> 02:51:49.346]  Invisible Empire.

[02:51:59.645 --> 02:52:02.926]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?

[02:52:14.391 --> 02:52:16.532]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:52:16.812 --> 02:52:22.775]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.

[02:52:26.319 --> 02:52:28.021]  There is no other program of its kind.

[02:53:47.418 --> 02:53:50.100]  All right, I want to get the rest of Max Keiser's take on the Internet 9-11.
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:53.041]  They're openly saying they want a Patriot Act for the Internet, the end of freedom.
[02:54:16.514 --> 02:54:21.536]  The end of mainstream radio TV being able to have your own opinion.
[02:54:21.576 --> 02:54:22.957]  It's all being announced.
[02:54:22.977 --> 02:54:24.358]  They're really trying to sell it to us.
[02:54:24.958 --> 02:54:29.040]  We've got these other key videos up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:34.762]  Walmart invasion, part of larger DHS takeover of America.
[02:54:35.282 --> 02:54:38.664]  We've got the accompanying article on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:38.804 --> 02:54:41.045]  Very important you get this out to everyone you know.
[02:54:41.445 --> 02:54:42.546]  They're ready to hear the truth.
[02:54:43.506 --> 02:54:49.192]  There's another longer video that Aaron just put together of an after-show rant I did yesterday.
[02:54:49.233 --> 02:54:50.033]  I was so upset.
[02:54:50.534 --> 02:54:51.975]  It's Alex Jones' rant.
[02:54:52.336 --> 02:54:55.339]  DHS and TSA invading America.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:59.784]  And so that video's up on InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[02:55:00.264 --> 02:55:01.265]  All right, Max Keiser.
[02:55:01.886 --> 02:55:02.086]  Yeah.
[02:55:02.146 --> 02:55:05.290]  What's your overall view of who's really behind WikiLeaks?
[02:55:05.430 --> 02:55:07.452]  I think he's been hung out to dry.
[02:55:07.472 --> 02:55:17.883]  I mean, regardless of who you believe he really works for, they have now leaked him a bunch of cables that are just internal propaganda for the government.
[02:55:18.504 --> 02:55:23.329]  And now it looks like they're going to use him as the kind of new Internet Bin Laden to take our free speech.
[02:55:23.988 --> 02:55:25.128]  He's an info-warrior.
[02:55:25.829 --> 02:55:26.549]  He's a hacker.
[02:55:27.309 --> 02:55:28.970]  And the hackers are uniting.
[02:55:29.010 --> 02:55:34.512]  You know, the hackers are getting together and they're going to shut down PayPal, shut down the bank in Switzerland that denied him his account.
[02:55:34.552 --> 02:55:35.613]  The hackers are organizing.
[02:55:35.673 --> 02:55:36.513]  It's an info-war.
[02:55:36.693 --> 02:55:38.574]  You know, you started the info-war, Alex Jones.
[02:55:38.954 --> 02:55:41.275]  Now it's being taken to a new level.
[02:55:41.315 --> 02:55:42.616]  You've got an army of hackers.
[02:55:43.016 --> 02:55:45.497]  And Julian Assange is basically... He's a hacker.
[02:55:45.537 --> 02:55:47.218]  That's where his background is in hacking.
[02:55:47.798 --> 02:55:49.919]  And, you know, he's hacked his way into the truth.
[02:55:50.459 --> 02:55:54.381]  And now the truth is being displayed through WikiLeaks, and it's embarrassing.
[02:55:54.421 --> 02:56:02.065]  People like Hillary Clinton and people in the Justice Department who don't like to see their dirty laundry aired in public, and it's made a mockery of their so-called diplomatic effort.
[02:56:02.545 --> 02:56:03.806]  And of course they want to shut them down.
[02:56:04.106 --> 02:56:11.810]  But it doesn't matter what they do, because all these things are hidden in the web, in these Easter eggs that are going to pop open at any time.
[02:56:12.470 --> 02:56:15.171]  If they go after them, then the mother load of information hits.
[02:56:15.191 --> 02:56:16.832]  They haven't even gone through one percent!
[02:56:17.392 --> 02:56:29.560]  So you think it's spin that he's hooked in with Soros and this is a global destabilization program?
[02:56:32.122 --> 02:56:45.110]  Well I know this, he doesn't deserve to be held with no bail for admittedly having sex with a consensual woman with no condom even though, I mean this is insane.
[02:56:45.530 --> 02:56:53.593]  Alex, Alex, look, the Icelandic government has a warrant for the arrest of their bankers hiding out in London who stole billions of dollars.
[02:56:53.633 --> 02:56:54.533]  Was there any action on them?
[02:56:54.553 --> 02:56:56.414]  Well, how come those guys aren't before the head of state?
[02:56:56.434 --> 02:56:57.214]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:56:57.574 --> 02:57:00.716]  I put out leaked stuff all the time that people have a right to know.
[02:57:00.736 --> 02:57:02.936]  I don't deserve to be held without bail.
[02:57:03.216 --> 02:57:07.258]  Look, if we don't stand with Assange, I don't care who he is or what's really going on.
[02:57:07.498 --> 02:57:08.598]  We all hang separate.
[02:57:08.958 --> 02:57:12.880]  And so I want to say here, I've had guests on with every view of him, good and bad and ugly.
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:16.544]  I want to say I'm standing with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.
[02:57:16.664 --> 02:57:22.230]  Even if they're a disinfo op, the globalists have built them as a straw man to destroy our free speech.
[02:57:22.490 --> 02:57:24.012]  We must stand with Assange.
[02:57:25.114 --> 02:57:26.755]  Look at the information itself.
[02:57:27.155 --> 02:57:35.978]  What is it actually in the information that you could point to that smells or looks like what you're suggesting in terms of a disinformation?
[02:57:36.358 --> 02:57:42.580]  All the information that's coming out is just embarrassing the powers that you always talk about.
[02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:47.542]  You know, the New World Order powers are extremely embarrassed by these revelations.
[02:57:47.622 --> 02:57:54.004]  I haven't seen a single piece of the communique come out in any of this that would suggest that it's a, you know, a reverse
[02:57:54.484 --> 02:57:56.585]  Psychological op or anything of that nature.
[02:57:56.785 --> 02:58:04.728]  He's just a guy who's an info warrior who realizes that information is the weapon of the 21st century.
[02:58:04.768 --> 02:58:15.732]  Well he's being persecuted regardless and we can't let him use Assange to shut down our web freedom like the Israelis launching the Stuxnet and then our media using that to try to shut down freedom.
[02:58:16.172 --> 02:58:19.913]  That may be true because, okay, again, Stacey just sent me an email.
[02:58:20.193 --> 02:58:25.435]  Joe Lieberman is calling for the New York Times to be investigated for espionage.
[02:58:25.635 --> 02:58:26.295]  I'll tell you what.
[02:58:27.015 --> 02:58:29.156]  We're just going to do a little bit of overdrive right now.
[02:58:29.176 --> 02:58:31.516]  I know I'm giving the guys a notice right here at the end.
[02:58:31.536 --> 02:58:32.037]  Can we do that?
[02:58:32.837 --> 02:58:34.697]  We're going into the fourth hour right now.
[02:58:35.338 --> 02:58:38.679]  And coming up later, I called Homeland Security today.
[02:58:41.719 --> 02:58:43.440]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.256 --> 02:58:47.405]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:50.250 --> 02:58:54.473]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:54.793 --> 02:58:55.073]  Number 1.
[02:58:55.714 --> 02:58:58.856]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:59.136 --> 02:58:59.696]  Number 2.
[02:58:59.997 --> 02:59:04.540]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:04.880 --> 02:59:05.320]  It's true.
[02:59:05.620 --> 02:59:10.183]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:10.504 --> 02:59:11.044]  Number 3.
[02:59:11.324 --> 02:59:14.606]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:14.906 --> 02:59:18.629]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:18.809 --> 02:59:19.370]  Number 4.
[02:59:19.610 --> 02:59:21.972]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.373 --> 02:59:25.756]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.057 --> 02:59:26.597]  Number 5.
[02:59:26.837 --> 02:59:30.762]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.002 --> 02:59:35.747]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.027 --> 02:59:40.071]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.211 --> 02:59:41.792]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.992 --> 02:59:44.094]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:44.234 --> 02:59:46.836]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:46.856 --> 02:59:52.281]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:52.661 --> 02:59:54.083]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.703 --> 02:59:57.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.974 --> 03:00:07.662]  Ahhhhhhh!
[03:00:18.284 --> 03:00:21.005]  Okay, we're in overdrive right now with Max Keiser.
[03:00:21.805 --> 03:00:29.368]  And yes, the neocons are all out in force, calling for espionage charges against the media, including the New York Times.
[03:00:30.268 --> 03:00:33.750]  Government is putting telescreens in the Walmarts, Mall of America.
[03:00:34.250 --> 03:00:37.611]  We are literally, it's like they're using 1984 as a playbook.
[03:00:38.051 --> 03:00:39.872]  Max Keiser, your take on the TSA?
[03:00:40.792 --> 03:00:42.954]  And invading the countryside now.
[03:00:43.354 --> 03:00:46.177]  The telescreens that are in London and now the U.S.
[03:00:46.897 --> 03:00:51.541]  And the point you were making about how this is their Internet Media 9-11.
[03:00:51.582 --> 03:00:52.302]  Please continue.
[03:00:52.903 --> 03:00:56.606]  Well, Alex, you live in a penal colony called the United States of America.
[03:00:58.385 --> 03:00:59.565]  You know, it's a penal colony.
[03:00:59.585 --> 03:01:01.546]  The citizens there live in prison.
[03:01:01.626 --> 03:01:02.467]  It's a penal colony.
[03:01:02.527 --> 03:01:03.247]  I would never visit.
[03:01:03.327 --> 03:01:04.607]  I haven't been there in 10 years.
[03:01:04.647 --> 03:01:05.688]  People say, come on, visit.
[03:01:05.948 --> 03:01:06.248]  Come back.
[03:01:06.568 --> 03:01:08.109]  I say, why would I visit a penal colony?
[03:01:08.129 --> 03:01:12.410]  It's like going to Devil's Island or some, you know, lockdown prison.
[03:01:12.610 --> 03:01:14.431]  That's not my idea of fun.
[03:01:14.931 --> 03:01:16.912]  I mean, it's become a joke.
[03:01:17.172 --> 03:01:21.574]  People who live outside of the America now refer to America and laugh out loud.
[03:01:21.594 --> 03:01:22.234]  What do you mean, Devin?
[03:01:22.274 --> 03:01:23.054]  Hold on, Max.
[03:01:23.074 --> 03:01:24.235]  Max, I mean, let's be fair.
[03:01:25.535 --> 03:01:27.837]  You're losing your freedoms in Europe, England.
[03:01:27.877 --> 03:01:29.198]  This is a worldwide tyranny.
[03:01:29.538 --> 03:01:33.960]  After all, Devil's Island was a French prison outfit.
[03:01:34.020 --> 03:01:34.881]  I mean, come on.
[03:01:34.941 --> 03:01:43.105]  Yeah, but you don't see this Walmart thing with people asking you to tattletale on your shopper.
[03:01:44.386 --> 03:01:46.067]  You might be a terrorist.
[03:01:46.207 --> 03:01:48.949]  Imagine, imagine Homeland Security.
[03:01:49.209 --> 03:01:54.692]  Information technology companies, the defense contracting companies, they ran out of third world countries to corrupt.
[03:01:54.732 --> 03:01:56.033]  They bankrupted the rest of the world.
[03:01:56.133 --> 03:01:57.614]  Now they're going to bankrupt America.
[03:01:57.634 --> 03:02:05.678]  And it's a big joke that they've got all these Americans stampeding on themselves to go shopping on Black Friday, killing themselves to be a spectacle for network TV.
[03:02:05.818 --> 03:02:10.581]  They have utter contempt on Americans and treat them like performing stunt pigs.
[03:02:11.041 --> 03:02:13.363]  And look at these pigs killing themselves for a deal.
[03:02:14.298 --> 03:02:15.898]  Food and milk, isn't that hilarious?
[03:02:16.259 --> 03:02:17.339]  It's a joke!
[03:02:17.359 --> 03:02:20.680]  Food is still living there and not migrating out of there.
[03:02:21.140 --> 03:02:23.441]  It's the same thing back in Nazi Germany.
[03:02:23.661 --> 03:02:25.041]  Why did the Jews stay behind?
[03:02:25.081 --> 03:02:31.043]  They said it couldn't happen to us, it could never happen to us, that we were citizens of this country, it's a democracy, they'll never put us in jail.
[03:02:31.323 --> 03:02:32.343]  They got burned to death!
[03:02:32.483 --> 03:02:34.004]  What do you think is going to be happening in America?
[03:02:34.024 --> 03:02:35.385]  It's going to be the final solution.
[03:02:35.645 --> 03:02:37.887]  People have no ability to make money.
[03:02:38.067 --> 03:02:39.468]  There's no benefit to these people.
[03:02:39.788 --> 03:02:43.130]  Like, Joe Lieberman is now investigating the New York Times for espionage.
[03:02:43.150 --> 03:02:45.572]  He'll come out and say, I believe in the final solution.
[03:02:45.592 --> 03:02:46.613]  I'm Joe Lieberman.
[03:02:46.653 --> 03:02:53.478]  We need to incinerate poor Americans today, or we're going to be overcome by our poverty.
[03:02:54.198 --> 03:02:55.379]  That's where they're headed.
[03:02:55.399 --> 03:03:01.043]  If you're still there in two years' time, there's a risk you'll be burnt to death in a government-owned oven.
[03:03:01.503 --> 03:03:02.064]  Get out!
[03:03:02.304 --> 03:03:03.224]  Get out now!
[03:03:04.906 --> 03:03:10.971]  Well, it is true that we have more people in our prisons than dozens of other major nations combined.
[03:03:10.991 --> 03:03:14.694]  We have four times what China... ...incarceration rate of America.
[03:03:14.714 --> 03:03:21.539]  It's the number one, it's the biggest growth population in America, the prison population, and increasingly that's where they're getting all their cheap labor.
[03:03:21.759 --> 03:03:23.340]  It's a prison labor population.
[03:03:23.521 --> 03:03:27.544]  Who do you think is manufacturing all the license plates and trotskies that they're selling overseas?
[03:03:27.604 --> 03:03:30.326]  It's the prisoners that they put in prison with those three-strike-you're-out rules.
[03:03:30.646 --> 03:03:36.450]  All the private prison operators, like Prison Corps of America, all the restaurants and the hotels, you go to prison and you end up eating in the restaurant there.
[03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:39.091]  The profit centers are, you'd be in prison.
[03:03:39.432 --> 03:03:40.692]  That's the most profitable business.
[03:03:40.992 --> 03:03:42.053]  Prisons and casinos.
[03:03:42.473 --> 03:03:50.618]  You see now that they want to, this guy, the head of the Democrats wants to legalize gambling in America, online poker, of course, because they want everyone to be, uh, digital.
[03:03:50.658 --> 03:03:51.859]  Yeah, you predicted that.
[03:03:52.159 --> 03:03:54.461]  It's, it's, yeah, no, I mean, it's hellish.
[03:03:55.802 --> 03:03:56.523]  Well, you live in there.
[03:03:56.683 --> 03:03:57.404]  You gotta get out of there.
[03:03:57.424 --> 03:04:03.532]  I don't think there's any nobility in being a guy, the last guy into the incinerator.
[03:04:03.692 --> 03:04:05.074]  I don't think there's anything noble about it.
[03:04:05.234 --> 03:04:08.999]  I think anyone should get out to protect yourself and your family.
[03:04:09.239 --> 03:04:10.200]  Go to another country.
[03:04:10.621 --> 03:04:14.686]  There's plenty of opportunities elsewhere in the world, and it's not that hard to expatriate.
[03:04:15.146 --> 03:04:16.406]  And say to hell with you.
[03:04:16.466 --> 03:04:19.127]  I'm not going to participate in your gulag casino nightmare.
[03:04:19.407 --> 03:04:20.668]  I'm going to go to some other country.
[03:04:20.708 --> 03:04:21.308]  Go to Chile.
[03:04:21.328 --> 03:04:23.049]  Chile's a fantastic country these days.
[03:04:23.089 --> 03:04:23.889]  Go to South America.
[03:04:23.929 --> 03:04:24.669]  Go to Central America.
[03:04:24.689 --> 03:04:27.630]  There's plenty of opportunities around the world.
[03:04:27.670 --> 03:04:27.990]  The U.S.
[03:04:28.010 --> 03:04:29.451]  has become a penal colony.
[03:04:29.491 --> 03:04:31.431]  Why would you voluntarily go to a penal colony?
[03:04:31.471 --> 03:04:32.051]  Makes no sense.
[03:04:32.292 --> 03:04:33.372]  Have you expatriated?
[03:04:36.148 --> 03:04:37.629]  It's in the process.
[03:04:37.769 --> 03:04:42.310]  It's very, very difficult to sever ties with the U.S.
[03:04:42.490 --> 03:04:43.050]  completely.
[03:04:43.450 --> 03:04:45.650]  It's a very long, drawn-out process.
[03:04:47.071 --> 03:04:47.311]  Yeah.
[03:04:47.831 --> 03:04:49.411]  Max, we'll talk to you again very soon.
[03:04:49.451 --> 03:04:51.232]  Big success with the silver move there.
[03:04:51.752 --> 03:04:52.292]  God bless you.
[03:04:52.312 --> 03:04:53.292]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:04:53.712 --> 03:04:59.974]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with retransmission when I call Homeland Security live on air and report the real terrorists.
[03:04:59.994 --> 03:05:00.994]  That's coming up next.
[03:05:01.314 --> 03:05:01.694]  Stay with us.
