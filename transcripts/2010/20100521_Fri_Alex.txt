[00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.250]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.011]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:09.772]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.772 --> 00:00:11.352]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:12.913]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:17.094]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:21.156]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.014]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:26.935]  It is May 21st, Friday, 2010.
[00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:32.417]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.438]  Let's get to the headlines.
[00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:39.060]  The two biggest stories today, in my opinion, are the media attacks
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.480]  on Rand Paul.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.261]  Now he's against civil liberties, folks.
[00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:47.423]  He wants to repeal the Civil Liberties Act, if you're listening to the mainstream media.
[00:00:47.423 --> 00:01:06.709]  And of course, President Calderon getting a standing O, a standing ovation in front of our Congress after he sits on the White House lawn with our betrayer, our supposed President, Barry Sotero, better known to the American public as Barack H. Obama.
[00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.301]  As they go against the wishes...
[00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:10.627]  I think?
[00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.850]  See, this isn't just about a North American Union.
[00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.854]  It's about building a one world government.
[00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:47.937]  Let's read this from the Huffington Post.
[00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:58.230]  Mexican President Felipe Calderon spoke before a joint session of Congress Thursday and received resounding applause after condemning Arizona's controversial immigration law.
[00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.692]  And this isn't new to the United States anymore.
[00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:04.436]  We had Gordon Brown get up in front of our Congress and say, you know what?
[00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:07.179]  We need a global new deal.
[00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:19.330]  As he was promoting a new world order, getting ready for the G20, where they announced their new world order, their consolidation of power, their IMF, World Bank, Federal Reserve power grab.
[00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:25.979]  I am convinced that a comprehensive immigration reform is also crucial to securing our common border.
[00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.664]  However, I strongly disagree with the recently adopted law in Arizona.
[00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:32.387]  It's like, we love you Calderon!
[00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:34.370]  We love Mexico so much!
[00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:39.295]  Folks, do you realize what Mexico is gearing up to do?
[00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:47.604]  They are gearing up to have their general populace give up all of their information and their fingerprints to have what?
[00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:48.565]  A cell phone.
[00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:50.106]  Not even a license to drive.
[00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:51.287]  If you don't have your cell phone...
[00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:58.151]  Or if you don't have these things done, they're about to shut off 30 million cell phones in Mexico.
[00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:00.052]  I have that headline here.
[00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:01.273]  That's being ignored.
[00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:06.776]  So maybe we should become a part of Mexico where everybody has to be track traced and database to have a cell phone.
[00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:07.396]  Openly.
[00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:10.178]  With your biometric thumb scan.
[00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:11.378]  That's why we should go with them.
[00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:12.219]  That's a good idea.
[00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:14.813]  People need to wake up.
[00:03:14.813 --> 00:03:17.113]  They need to get beyond race.
[00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:23.696]  And later on, we're going to play this video of Wolf Blitzer trying to put Rand Paul into a corner and basically call him a racist.
[00:03:23.696 --> 00:03:31.239]  But Rand Paul handles himself excellently and says, look, there were parts of the Civil Rights Act that I don't necessarily agree with.
[00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.021]  And look, when I'm talking about the Disabilities Act, I'm saying, hey,
[00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:52.367]  If you're a small business you have a two-story building and somebody happens to work with you has a wheelchair maybe you offer them an office on the first floor instead of installing a hundred thousand dollar elevator system just for that one person because you may very well put that small business
[00:03:53.382 --> 00:03:58.446]  out on the streets and no longer to give capital to other citizens of the United States.
[00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.687]  Very well spoken.
[00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:01.189]  Lays it directly out.
[00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:11.257]  But that doesn't stop the LA Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, all these people trying to make him out to be a racist because he is a threat to the establishment.
[00:04:11.257 --> 00:04:15.220]  He is going to go up against these globalists.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.021]  And that's what this is about.
[00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:17.642]  It's about globalization.
[00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:21.406]  It's about the establishment having these people in their pockets.
[00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:25.007]  And that's why you're not seeing Arlen Specter out there anymore.
[00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:29.608]  So when we come back, we're going to have Alex Jones talk about this situation with Calderon.
[00:04:29.608 --> 00:04:42.012]  Again, standing ovations for the President of Mexico, who's condemning, condemning Arizona citizens for basically standing up and saying, look, we've had enough.
[00:04:42.012 --> 00:04:43.193]  Our economy's in shambles.
[00:04:43.193 --> 00:04:45.673]  We're taking back our state and hopefully this country.
[00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:46.654]  We'll be back after this.
[00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:50.275]  It's the Alex Jones Show, only at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:04.292]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:09.634]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:11.675]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:16.676]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:17.857]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.857 --> 00:05:18.597]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:20.859]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:21.941]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:24.143]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:24.143 --> 00:05:25.485]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.485 --> 00:05:27.007]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:27.007 --> 00:05:32.273]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:32.273 --> 00:05:35.417]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.857 --> 00:05:39.680]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.900]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.801]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:42.922]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.922 --> 00:05:43.842]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:44.943]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:47.985]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:50.187]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:51.187]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.301]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:06.562]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.562 --> 00:06:10.283]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.283 --> 00:06:12.724]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.724 --> 00:06:18.586]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:24.809]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:31.211]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:35.412]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.412 --> 00:06:39.693]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.693 --> 00:06:45.655]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:49.196]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:49.196 --> 00:06:51.177]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:51.617]  It's here.
[00:06:52.257 --> 00:07:00.703]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:01.383]  Attention!
[00:07:01.383 --> 00:07:16.753]  An important product from HempUSA.org, MicroPlant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[00:07:16.753 --> 00:07:19.314]  MicroPlant Powder is 89% silica and packed with a
[00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:20.715]  I think so.
[00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:45.759]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.322 --> 00:08:16.263]  Folks, we are back.
[00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:17.284]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:17.284 --> 00:08:19.185]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:08:19.185 --> 00:08:30.455]  And I want to give a short introduction to this piece by Alex about Calderon not only being on the White House lawn, but now getting a standing ovation in front of Congress.
[00:08:30.455 --> 00:08:31.896]  That's what foreign leaders do now.
[00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:37.762]  They come to this country and get standing ovations when they condemn freedom and sovereignty of
[00:08:38.402 --> 00:08:39.424]  The American people.
[00:08:39.424 --> 00:08:42.230]  That's the reality of the situation.
[00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.101]  You have Barack Obama up there talking about this Arizona law and he says, well, I think it has the potential.
[00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:50.072]  to be racially motivated.
[00:08:50.072 --> 00:08:57.655]  And then his wife, if you haven't seen it yet, she's sitting there with all these young students and this poor little girl says, my mommy doesn't have papers.
[00:08:57.655 --> 00:08:59.255]  Is she going to be taken away?
[00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:00.416]  No, we need to fix that.
[00:09:00.416 --> 00:09:02.756]  We need to find a way to fix that.
[00:09:02.756 --> 00:09:09.939]  Which basically means blanket amnesty for anybody who's in this country while they leave the borders wide open.
[00:09:09.939 --> 00:09:10.239]  Why?
[00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:14.241]  Because they are demanding a North American Union.
[00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:17.502]  So let's get to this video right now over at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:26.090]  And PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.254]  Everybody needs to get angry and let these people know that we are not their slaves.
[00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:31.956]  You hear that, Colerone?
[00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:40.965]  But believe me, many of these guns are not going to honest American hands.
[00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:47.504]  Instead, thousands are ending up in the hands of criminals.
[00:09:47.504 --> 00:10:02.492]  With all due respect, if you do not regulate the sale of these weapons in the right way, nothing guarantees that criminals here in the United States with access to the same power of weapons
[00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:28.329]  We'll not decided to challenge American authorities and civilians, but I will ask Congress to help us with respect and to understand how important it is for us that you enforce current laws to stem the supply of these weapons to criminals and consider restating the assault weapons ban.
[00:10:31.584 --> 00:10:38.233]  Just when I think I can't get any more outrage, something new happens that makes my temperature rise, my blood boil.
[00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:47.004]  Felipe Calderon, who clearly stole the election to become Mexican President, who's connected to all sorts of corrupt organizations down in Mexico,
[00:10:47.885 --> 00:11:02.098]  is in the United States traveling around lecturing us about states' rights and telling us that police when they have first contact with an illegal alien for say drunk driving or some other suspected crime can ask for their ID.
[00:11:02.098 --> 00:11:02.598]  Okay?
[00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:14.689]  While the American people are having our rights trampled on a daily basis and John McCain and Lieberman are trying to pass legislation where US citizens can be secretly arrested by the Pentagon or Justice Department and have our rights stripped.
[00:11:15.189 --> 00:11:20.191]  Have you had a chance to review the new law that was passed by the state of Arizona?
[00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:21.192]  I've not reviewed it in detail.
[00:11:21.192 --> 00:11:22.972]  I certainly know of it, Senator.
[00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:50.358]  Let me just say this, as you know and are well aware, that's not the kind of law I would have signed.
[00:11:51.365 --> 00:11:54.407]  Because if you've read the bill, you know this is all a giant hoax.
[00:11:54.407 --> 00:11:56.108]  It isn't violating anybody's right.
[00:11:56.108 --> 00:12:03.613]  And Mexico has some of the most draconian laws against people that come into their country out of Guatemala from Central and South America.
[00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:05.474]  Some of the most draconian in the world.
[00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:06.995]  But that's not why I'm outraged.
[00:12:06.995 --> 00:12:18.262]  Okay, that's bad enough to have a foreign president who's illegitimate, who runs a failed, collapsed state with 20-plus thousand deaths the last two years, and crime pouring across our borders, ranchers being murdered.
[00:12:18.262 --> 00:12:19.423]  That's not what's got me mad.
[00:12:20.492 --> 00:12:27.919]  Can you imagine if an American president, say, went to Germany or China and told them what to do?
[00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:35.305]  Can you imagine if the British Prime Minister came here and said, you need to pass anti-Second Amendment legislation.
[00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:38.889]  You need to ban assault weapons, all semi-automatic rifles and handguns.
[00:12:39.656 --> 00:12:40.536]  That's what he did!
[00:12:40.536 --> 00:12:43.238]  That's what he said today!
[00:12:43.238 --> 00:12:44.438]  To the Congress!
[00:12:44.438 --> 00:12:45.899]  In fact, here's the Reuters headline.
[00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:47.039]  Calderon urges U.S.
[00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:52.661]  to reinstate assault weapons ban and blames us for what's happening in Mexico.
[00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:55.863]  You do not regulate the sale of these weapons in the right way.
[00:12:57.239 --> 00:13:00.121]  Mexico has a total gun ban for their citizens.
[00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:08.026]  So all these different gangs, some government backed, others that aren't, can have these big wars with each other and they have kidnappings and people being shaken down.
[00:13:08.026 --> 00:13:12.249]  Every time villagers try to stand up against tyranny, they get machine gunned.
[00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:20.914]  I mean, Mexico is a nightmare police state that is a black hole of corruption that is now sucking the United States into it.
[00:13:20.914 --> 00:13:22.796]  And Felipe Calderon, this gangster,
[00:13:23.496 --> 00:13:28.180]  He comes to the United States and in effect says, I want the American people's guns.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.443]  I want you to be peon slaves like the people of Mexico are.
[00:13:32.443 --> 00:13:34.265]  I want to be your el jefe.
[00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:35.285]  I'm going to run your life.
[00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:37.527]  And Obama went further on the White House lawn.
[00:13:37.527 --> 00:13:44.172]  He said that our nations are not defined by their borders and that we're all one people.
[00:13:44.172 --> 00:13:49.016]  In the 21st century we are defined not by our borders, but by our bonds.
[00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:52.339]  So I say to you and to the Mexican people, let us stand together.
[00:13:53.407 --> 00:13:55.448]  This is all about the North American Union.
[00:13:55.448 --> 00:13:58.028]  This is all about global government.
[00:13:58.028 --> 00:13:59.609]  Alright folks, we're going to cut it right there.
[00:13:59.609 --> 00:14:05.090]  If you want to see the full video, that's about half of it, you can go to InfoWars.com right now.
[00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.411]  Let me read you the article.
[00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:09.111]  Mexican president wants to disarm Americans.
[00:14:09.111 --> 00:14:14.953]  See, it's okay when Calderon and his gang of thugs have assault weapons.
[00:14:14.953 --> 00:14:18.214]  When they run the military, they're allowed to have those things.
[00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:19.875]  We're not.
[00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:21.877]  We can't defend ourselves.
[00:14:21.877 --> 00:14:32.565]  And it is absolutely ludicrous to say that criminal elements in Mexico and the United States on the borders are getting out of control because there's no assault weapons ban.
[00:14:32.565 --> 00:14:36.489]  No, the violence, in most cases, is caused by who?
[00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:40.972]  Well, black ops and special forces running the drugs, in most cases.
[00:14:40.972 --> 00:14:42.834]  And you know what happens in Mexico.
[00:14:42.834 --> 00:14:47.257]  Folks, the drug dealers there are the multimillionaires and the billionaires.
[00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:57.524]  And again, that's why they want to create this corporate entity of a North American Union merging Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
[00:14:57.524 --> 00:15:05.890]  That's why we go over the securities and prosperity documents, the SPP documents, in Invisible Empire, a new world order defined.
[00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.150]  And they want your guns, folks.
[00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.771]  Let's be real about it.
[00:15:08.771 --> 00:15:15.456]  Let's admit to ourselves this isn't to protect anybody except for the elitists and their agendas.
[00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:27.354]  Mexican President Felipe Calderon called upon the United States Congress to reenact the assault weapons ban in a bid to disarm the American people as they are integrated into the North American Union system.
[00:15:27.354 --> 00:15:36.042]  Further, he placed blame for fueling drug cartels and gang violence squarely on the United States and their supply of the firearms.
[00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:39.845]  Oh yes, it's our fault because we're not regulating the slaves' firearms.
[00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:46.050]  Calderon made these outrageous and anti-American remarks from the floor of the U.S.
[00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:46.470]  Congress.
[00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:53.975]  We just give these people the largest venue possible and then we parrot it on every major media station.
[00:15:53.975 --> 00:15:54.956]  It's unbelievable.
[00:15:56.544 --> 00:16:03.790]  During an official visit and also renewed attacks on the immigration legislation passed by Arizona, President Obama joined in his cause.
[00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.013]  President Obama is the quintessential globalist.
[00:16:07.013 --> 00:16:17.583]  He is the guy that sat as the head of the UN Security Council as he told people, no world order can rise above another.
[00:16:18.163 --> 00:16:22.585]  And then he talked about some Johnny nonsense that no nation should try to dominate another.
[00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:32.469]  Meanwhile, we're in Eurasia trying to create a Eurasian Union with our dominance over Afghanistan, Iraq, and let's be real, Pakistan as well.
[00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:33.150]  That's the reality.
[00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:41.313]  It's okay when we do it, when it's a globalist agenda, but it's not okay when the slaves want to say, we want states' rights.
[00:16:41.313 --> 00:16:42.754]  We want our guns.
[00:16:44.198 --> 00:16:47.860]  Alex Jones responds to these radical statements in a video address which we just played.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.422]  So please, people, get the video.
[00:16:50.422 --> 00:16:51.583]  Get it out to folks.
[00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:54.365]  It is so important you realize where we are.
[00:16:54.365 --> 00:17:00.209]  This is, again, a society that is willing to shut off 30 million cell phones.
[00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:07.293]  30 million cell phones in Mexico if they don't bow down and give up their biometric information.
[00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:09.095]  Is that what we need in this country?
[00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:13.878]  Is that how we should merge with other nations under a slave grid of tyranny?
[00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:22.722]  A slave grid of tyranny and we're having that cashless society control grid put right here by corporate entities in front of our very own eyes.
[00:17:22.722 --> 00:17:31.026]  I was shocked, shocked, shocked to learn this week that you can't even buy one of those crappy iPads, which I think are total junk by the way.
[00:17:31.026 --> 00:17:35.428]  Wait for some kind of an open source PC replacement before you get one of those.
[00:17:35.428 --> 00:17:37.489]  Especially because they won't take cash!
[00:17:38.632 --> 00:17:41.394]  Cash is no longer really legal tender in this country.
[00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:42.714]  They can turn you away.
[00:17:42.714 --> 00:17:49.759]  Isn't there a law somewhere that a business has to take legal tender, government-issued currency?
[00:17:49.759 --> 00:17:50.619]  But they just refuse.
[00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:54.561]  They say, no, no, no, you have to have a slave card, a.k.a.
[00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:59.845]  a credit card or a debit card to buy this because we're worried about piracy.
[00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:06.609]  What they're really worried about is not being able to track, trace and database everything you do on this thing to a registered user.
[00:18:07.409 --> 00:18:15.535]  To a registered user, everything is already being tracked, traced and databased on the internet through companies like AT&T.
[00:18:15.535 --> 00:18:18.957]  And as you know, AT&T still has the exclusive on the iPhone.
[00:18:18.957 --> 00:18:19.697]  Don't believe me?
[00:18:19.697 --> 00:18:22.339]  Go check out Hepting vs AT&T.
[00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:26.002]  Twice, twice, twice thrown out of the Supreme Court.
[00:18:26.542 --> 00:18:28.163]  What is Hepting vs. AT&T?
[00:18:28.163 --> 00:18:41.194]  Well, it was over 80 tech specialists from all the major telecommunication companies coming clean and saying, yes, they do have secret NSA rooms where we basically split the internet and divide them off so they're all held... Everything you do...
[00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:42.054]  I think so.
[00:18:58.996 --> 00:19:03.558]  And they're not just going after the bad guys, folks, because you are the bad guy.
[00:19:03.558 --> 00:19:07.139]  Read the recent Homeland Security documents that aren't even recent anymore.
[00:19:07.139 --> 00:19:12.021]  They're over a year old, coming out in March, where you are the terrorist.
[00:19:12.021 --> 00:19:14.022]  Where the American people are the problem.
[00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:20.285]  Where people with Ron Paul bumper stickers are an issue of national security.
[00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.846]  Don't have that don't tread on me flag.
[00:19:22.846 --> 00:19:24.747]  Don't hand out videos to other people.
[00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:26.507]  Don't have a Christian identity.
[00:19:26.507 --> 00:19:27.528]  And God forbid,
[00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:35.134]  You speak of the New World Order, which these people are openly trying to erect in a negative manner.
[00:19:35.134 --> 00:19:41.100]  So when we come back, we're going to have Senator McClintock talk about these statements by Calderon and so much more.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.221]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:42.221 --> 00:19:43.482]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:46.324]  Check us out over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:01.346 --> 00:20:01.927]  Fact.

[00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:05.932]  Fact.
[00:20:05.932 --> 00:20:09.617]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.617 --> 00:20:10.238]  Fact.
[00:20:10.238 --> 00:20:15.745]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.745 --> 00:20:16.026]  Fact.
[00:20:16.366 --> 00:20:20.548]  One in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.548 --> 00:20:25.110]  Fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:14.064]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:19.807]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:21:19.807 --> 00:21:22.768]  Starve or surrender.
[00:21:22.768 --> 00:21:26.570]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.451]  What then?

[00:22:00.325 --> 00:22:03.286]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:22:03.286 --> 00:22:07.428]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:22:07.428 --> 00:22:09.709]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:09.709 --> 00:22:14.871]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:22:14.871 --> 00:22:16.691]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:18.232]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:22:18.232 --> 00:22:19.733]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:23.094]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:22:23.094 --> 00:22:28.116]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:22:28.456 --> 00:22:37.802]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[00:22:42.985 --> 00:22:46.468]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[00:22:58.635 --> 00:23:00.116]  It's 2237.
[00:23:00.116 --> 00:23:01.036]  You worry.
[00:23:01.036 --> 00:23:03.056]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:23:03.056 --> 00:23:05.597]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:23:05.597 --> 00:23:07.677]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:09.298]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:23:09.298 --> 00:23:12.899]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:23:12.899 --> 00:23:18.120]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.421]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:23:21.923 --> 00:23:23.624]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:23:23.624 --> 00:23:26.467]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[00:23:26.467 --> 00:23:29.789]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:38.236]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:23:38.236 --> 00:23:42.920]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:23:46.943 --> 00:23:50.406]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-9.
[00:24:07.918 --> 00:24:09.039]  We are back live.
[00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:10.039]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:13.801]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for Alex.
[00:24:13.801 --> 00:24:19.664]  Congresswoman McClintock really breaks this down better than I could, but we're not going to have time in this segment, so we're going to go to it
[00:24:20.504 --> 00:24:22.145]  At the top of the next segment.
[00:24:22.145 --> 00:24:24.645]  But let's review why this is so important.
[00:24:24.645 --> 00:24:31.247]  For years and years and years the establishment line was we are not working towards a North American Union.
[00:24:31.247 --> 00:24:32.508]  We don't want to merge.
[00:24:32.508 --> 00:24:34.908]  We would never go for global government.
[00:24:34.908 --> 00:24:47.512]  But that has really changed in its outward appearance with people even like Lou Dobbs reporting on this in 2004 and 2005 when the SPP documents, the Security and Prosperity documents,
[00:24:48.012 --> 00:24:49.073]  We're good to go.
[00:25:12.165 --> 00:25:18.246]  But now with the media fervor, with the issue in Arizona, they are going to raise the issue yet again.
[00:25:18.246 --> 00:25:31.289]  They give the excuse to Calderón, the new president of Mexico, to stand before our Congress and tell us how to run our country under a North American Union system.
[00:25:31.289 --> 00:25:33.529]  One where assault weapons are banned!
[00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:34.750]  Where Mexico is good!
[00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.130]  Where there is no crime in Mexico, there's no degradation.
[00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:38.910]  No, no, no.
[00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.751]  They're not ruining the economy here!
[00:25:41.531 --> 00:25:44.777]  And folks, again, if I was a Mexican citizen, I'd do the same thing.
[00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:45.659]  I would come over the border.
[00:25:45.659 --> 00:25:47.162]  I would look for a better life.
[00:25:47.162 --> 00:25:51.190]  But, if we're going to have them here, number one, let's secure our borders.
[00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.711]  Number two...
[00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:55.152]  If they're doing something illegal, we need to deport them!
[00:25:55.152 --> 00:25:58.254]  We need to have a real path to citizenship.
[00:25:58.254 --> 00:25:58.654]  Okay?
[00:25:58.654 --> 00:26:07.119]  Not one of these phony paths to citizenship where you've got a consular matricula card, and it's blanket amnesty, and the borders are left wide open, because that's what they want!
[00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:15.243]  Because they've de-industrialized this nation, and if they have enough people come in working for six, seven, eight, nine, ten dollars an hour under the table, guess what?
[00:26:15.243 --> 00:26:19.986]  Those jobs you used to have, and you've been seeing it the last five to ten years, where you had benefits,
[00:26:20.566 --> 00:26:28.576]  Where you had a decent wage, where you could make a living, where you could raise a family, where you could buy a house, are now gone.
[00:26:28.576 --> 00:26:30.639]  And the people in Arizona are fed up with it.
[00:26:30.639 --> 00:26:31.200]  They're done.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.965]  They're saying, look, we need to stop this.
[00:26:34.965 --> 00:26:37.187]  If the federales will not enforce the law,
[00:26:38.283 --> 00:26:41.225]  Let's have our police officers do it.
[00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:46.529]  If they pull somebody over who happens to be drunk and an illegal immigrant, they should be sent back.
[00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:47.870]  Isn't that the thing?
[00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:55.416]  I've been pulled over on the side of my street in New York, not drinking, not in a car, and demanded my ID.
[00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:57.217]  My ID was demanded of me.
[00:26:57.217 --> 00:26:59.259]  When I said, hey, do you know about the Fourth Amendment?
[00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.293]  You know, the right to be secure in your persons and properties.
[00:27:03.293 --> 00:27:14.626]  The guys literally went to their mace and pulled their mace out and were going to mace me for walking down the street with a cup of coffee at 7.30 in the evening.
[00:27:14.626 --> 00:27:19.971]  Because I supposedly fit the profile of a suspect in a robbery.
[00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:20.071]  Me.
[00:27:20.632 --> 00:27:34.056]  Me, in a small town where I graduated with 50 other kids, okay, a population of an astounding 1,112 people, I fit the description of somebody who robbed somebody.
[00:27:34.056 --> 00:27:39.338]  Totally made up, totally nonsense, but I have to show my ID.
[00:27:39.338 --> 00:27:45.820]  I've been denied for tobacco and alcohol in the state of Texas when I showed my ID card.
[00:27:47.025 --> 00:27:56.610]  But yet it's not okay for Arizona to demand somebody's identification to find out if they're an illegal immigrant or not when they break the law.
[00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:58.311]  No, we're just going to keep them in the country.
[00:27:58.311 --> 00:27:59.531]  It's absolutely ludicrous.
[00:27:59.531 --> 00:28:01.212]  It's absolutely insane.
[00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:09.816]  And Alex has also made the point that look at all this anti-American legislation that's being passed, including the Enemy Belligerent Act.
[00:28:09.816 --> 00:28:12.578]  Forget about being an enemy combatant.
[00:28:13.198 --> 00:28:23.101]  Now if you speak your mind, if you stand up to the system, if you get out in the streets and scream from the mountaintops, you may be an enemy belligerent!
[00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:25.482]  The First Amendment apparently means nothing!
[00:28:25.482 --> 00:28:27.742]  You're aiding and abetting the terrorists!
[00:28:27.742 --> 00:28:29.463]  The terrorists they've created!
[00:28:30.143 --> 00:28:31.604]  And it's on record.
[00:28:31.604 --> 00:28:35.825]  How many headlines do we need in the past week for people to understand?
[00:28:35.825 --> 00:28:37.265]  We run the opium!
[00:28:37.265 --> 00:28:39.766]  We work with Karzai's warlord brother.
[00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:44.388]  Not only under the Obama administration, but under the Bush administration as well.
[00:28:44.388 --> 00:28:47.389]  This is par for the course.
[00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:48.249]  Par for the course.
[00:28:48.249 --> 00:28:53.771]  And they're trying to bring that tyranny, that police state type occupation here to this country.
[00:28:54.557 --> 00:28:55.658]  to this country.
[00:28:55.658 --> 00:28:58.841]  That's why they want to establish a North American Union.
[00:28:58.841 --> 00:29:02.124]  They'd love to have United Nations troops on the streets.
[00:29:02.124 --> 00:29:06.007]  They'd love to have Mexican troops patrol our streets.
[00:29:06.007 --> 00:29:13.674]  Because they're going to have a lot less of a hard time confiscating guns and shooting your kids in the back than American soldiers are.
[00:29:13.674 --> 00:29:17.917]  And even our American soldiers, in some cases, have really lost their way.
[00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:27.425]  I don't think it's a good thing when I watch videos of children getting gunned down and our soldiers laughing and high-fiving about it.
[00:29:27.425 --> 00:29:29.047]  The moral degradation is unbelievable.
[00:29:29.047 --> 00:29:38.954]  So on the other side, we're going to have Congressman McClintock talk about Calderon betraying us Americans, and really his own people, in front of Congress.
[00:29:38.954 --> 00:29:40.555]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:42.617]  Check us out at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.663]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.663 --> 00:30:00.168]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.168 --> 00:30:01.469]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.469 --> 00:30:07.054]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:07.054 --> 00:30:12.078]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:12.078 --> 00:30:17.103]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:17.623 --> 00:30:22.847]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:22.847 --> 00:30:29.973]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:29.973 --> 00:30:31.094]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:31.094 --> 00:30:37.459]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:40.961]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:40.961 --> 00:30:43.183]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:30:44.123 --> 00:30:44.523]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:44.523 --> 00:30:47.765]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:47.765 --> 00:30:49.527]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:01.670]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:05.033]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:31:05.033 --> 00:31:10.256]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:31:10.256 --> 00:31:13.699]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[00:31:13.699 --> 00:31:15.720]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:20.202]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[00:31:20.202 --> 00:31:21.322]  Take my word for it.
[00:31:21.322 --> 00:31:23.983]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:31:23.983 --> 00:31:30.505]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:31:30.505 --> 00:31:32.006]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:31:35.687 --> 00:31:37.027]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[00:31:40.327 --> 00:31:48.252]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed or double your dirt back!
[00:31:48.252 --> 00:31:52.395]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[00:31:52.395 --> 00:31:53.195]  Thank you!
[00:31:59.727 --> 00:32:02.029]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:04.312]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:32:04.312 --> 00:32:07.635]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:32:07.635 --> 00:32:12.740]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.945]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:32:17.245 --> 00:32:19.586]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:32:19.586 --> 00:32:22.127]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:32:22.127 --> 00:32:25.388]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:32:25.388 --> 00:32:32.991]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:32:33.331 --> 00:32:38.716]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:32:38.716 --> 00:32:41.559]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:45.263]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:46.324]  And I got news for you.
[00:32:46.324 --> 00:32:47.665]  You're everyone else.
[00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.166]  Invisible Empire.

[00:33:05.663 --> 00:33:08.067]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:33:08.067 --> 00:33:10.812]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:22.415]  Calderon gets a standing ovation in front of our Congress, just like when Gordon Brown came down and announced his global new deal.
[00:33:22.415 --> 00:33:27.178]  And folks, it is so disgusting that we are embracing this.
[00:33:27.178 --> 00:33:27.918]  Where?
[00:33:27.918 --> 00:33:29.499]  In the mainstream media.
[00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:31.160]  In the establishment mindset.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.421]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:34.602]  I am Jason Vermas sitting in.
[00:33:34.602 --> 00:33:38.725]  So we're going to go to this video right now of Congressman McClintock.
[00:33:39.605 --> 00:33:44.888]  And of course he has nowhere near the audience that Calderon did, telling it like it is.
[00:33:44.888 --> 00:33:46.109]  So let's hit the clip.
[00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:54.133]  Speaker, I rise to take strong exception to the speech by the President of Mexico here in this chamber today.
[00:33:54.133 --> 00:34:07.360]  The Mexican government has made it very clear for many years that it holds American sovereignty in contempt, and President Calderon's behavior as a guest of the Congress today confirms and underscores this attitude.
[00:34:08.445 --> 00:34:20.992]  It is highly inappropriate for the President of Mexico to lecture Americans on American immigration law just as it would be for Americans to lecture Mexico on its own laws.
[00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:28.556]  It is obvious that President Calderon does not understand the nature of America or the purpose of our immigration law.
[00:34:28.556 --> 00:34:32.818]  Unlike Mexico's immigration law, which is brutally exclusionary,
[00:34:33.607 --> 00:34:36.750]  The purpose of America's law is not to keep people out.
[00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:47.599]  It is to assure that as people come to the United States, they do so with the intention of becoming Americans and of raising their children as Americans.
[00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:52.043]  Unlike Mexico, our nation embraces legal immigration.
[00:34:52.043 --> 00:34:56.247]  And what makes that possible is assimilation.
[00:34:56.247 --> 00:34:58.949]  A century ago, President Teddy Roosevelt put it this way.
[00:34:58.949 --> 00:34:59.650]  He said, quote,
[00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:12.518]  In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American, assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else.
[00:35:12.518 --> 00:35:20.403]  For it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin.
[00:35:20.403 --> 00:35:27.488]  But this is predicated upon this person's becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American.
[00:35:28.146 --> 00:35:31.227]  There can be no divided allegiance here.
[00:35:31.227 --> 00:35:36.428]  Any man who says he's an American, but something else also isn't an American at all.
[00:35:36.428 --> 00:35:40.730]  We have room but for one flag, the American flag.
[00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:45.471]  We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language.
[00:35:45.471 --> 00:35:51.512]  And we have room for but one sole loyalty, and that is a loyalty to the American people.
[00:35:51.512 --> 00:35:52.933]  End of quote.
[00:35:52.933 --> 00:35:56.734]  That's how we've created one great nation from all the nations of the world.
[00:35:57.754 --> 00:36:01.056]  The largest group of immigrants now comes from Mexico.
[00:36:01.056 --> 00:36:19.587]  A recent RAND study discovered that during the 20th century, while our immigration laws were actually enforced, assimilation worked, and it made possible the swift attainment of the American dream for millions of immigrants seeking to escape the conditions of Mexico.
[00:36:19.587 --> 00:36:26.811]  That is the broader meaning of our nation's motto, E Pluribus Unum, from many people, one people, the American people.
[00:36:27.782 --> 00:36:33.986]  But there's now an element in our political structure that seeks to undermine that concept of E Pluribus Unum.
[00:36:33.986 --> 00:36:53.437]  It seeks to hyphenate Americans, to develop linguistic divisions, to assign rights and preferences based on race and ethnicity, and to elevate devotion to foreign ideologies and traditions, while at the same time denigrating American culture, American values, and American founding principles.
[00:36:54.097 --> 00:36:58.441]  In order to do so, they know that they have to stop the process of assimilation.
[00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:03.004]  And in order to do that, they have to undermine our immigration laws.
[00:37:03.004 --> 00:37:09.409]  It is an outrage that a foreign head of state would appear in Denver and actively seek to do so.
[00:37:09.409 --> 00:37:16.455]  And it is a disgrace that he would be cheered on from the left wing of the White House and from many Democrats here in Congress.
[00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:20.596]  Arizona has not adopted a new immigration law.
[00:37:20.596 --> 00:37:26.618]  All it has done is to enforce existing law that this president refuses to enforce.
[00:37:26.618 --> 00:37:40.182]  It's hardly a radical policy to suggest that if an officer on a routine traffic stop encounters a driver with no driver's license, no passport, and who doesn't speak English, that maybe that individual might be here illegally.
[00:37:41.207 --> 00:37:50.013]  And to those who say we must reform our immigration laws, I reply, we don't need to reform them, we need to enforce them.
[00:37:50.013 --> 00:37:55.737]  Just as every other government does, just as Mexico does.
[00:37:55.737 --> 00:37:59.260]  Above all, this is a debate of, by, and for the American people.
[00:37:59.895 --> 00:38:21.809]  If President Calderon wishes to participate in that debate, I invite him to obey our immigration laws, apply for citizenship, do what 600,000 legal immigrants to our nation are doing right now, learn our history and our customs, and become an American, and then he will have every right to participate in that debate.
[00:38:21.809 --> 00:38:27.112]  Until then, I would politely invite him to have the courtesy, while a guest of this Congress,
[00:38:27.904 --> 00:38:33.326]  And if you missed any of that video, you can go see it right now over at Infowars.com.
[00:38:33.326 --> 00:38:37.088]  That's the Congressman out of California, McClintock, and he said it
[00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:47.592]  Very, very well.
[00:38:47.592 --> 00:38:53.518]  He said, look, we had immigration that worked in the vast majority of the 20th century.
[00:38:53.518 --> 00:38:56.221]  When people came here, they learned the language.
[00:38:56.221 --> 00:39:01.406]  They were assimilated into our constitutional republic.
[00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:07.612]  And right now, they're trying to demonize us for saying, look, these people aren't coming in the right way.
[00:39:07.612 --> 00:39:09.794]  They're not applying for citizenship.
[00:39:09.794 --> 00:39:10.775]  My favorite neighbor,
[00:39:11.798 --> 00:39:13.179]  In New York.
[00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:14.559]  My only neighbor, really.
[00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:15.840]  She's Vietnamese.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.041]  She struggled for over a decade, a decade to become a citizen.
[00:39:20.041 --> 00:39:22.422]  She went through the proper channels.
[00:39:22.422 --> 00:39:32.706]  Now, what the mainstream media is going to do is they're going to show some horror stories like the one I have in my hand right here and say, look how they're trying to go after these good illegal immigrants.
[00:39:32.706 --> 00:39:34.887]  This young girl, she's 21 years old.
[00:39:34.887 --> 00:39:36.148]  She's attending college.
[00:39:36.148 --> 00:39:38.529]  Her name is Jessica Collado.
[00:39:39.537 --> 00:39:42.639]  And she was basically taken out and now they might deport her.
[00:39:42.639 --> 00:39:44.520]  Now, this is a girl that's worked very hard.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.801]  She does want to become a citizen of the United States.
[00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:48.502]  She is in college.
[00:39:48.502 --> 00:40:01.769]  And what they're just trying to do in Arizona is say, look, if you pull somebody over and they're drunk, or if somebody's breaking the law, or if somebody's robbing an apartment, or somebody assaults somebody, and they happen to be an illegal immigrant, they don't get to stay!
[00:40:01.769 --> 00:40:02.570]  They have to go!
[00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.752]  That's the way it should be.
[00:40:04.752 --> 00:40:09.239]  They're just enforcing the law that's already on the books.
[00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:17.072]  But there is such a push to get rid of that law, that now the establishment is saying, no, no, no, that's racism!
[00:40:18.092 --> 00:40:22.434]  If you win a Senate primary like Rand Paul, you're a racist, you're against civil rights.
[00:40:22.434 --> 00:40:29.077]  We're going to go into that in detail with Paul Joseph Watson coming up at the top of the next hour.
[00:40:29.077 --> 00:40:33.640]  We're going to also take your calls in the next five or ten minutes, but I want to hit some of the other headlines here.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.862]  That I haven't been able to.
[00:40:36.862 --> 00:40:46.652]  Especially this 7-7 headline where they're now going to probe, believe it or not, they're going to probe MI5's role in the 7-7 attacks.
[00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:50.396]  Of course, MI5 is one of these spying agencies over in
[00:40:51.337 --> 00:40:52.818]  The United Kingdom!
[00:40:52.818 --> 00:40:57.480]  And for years we have documented what really took place on 7-7.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:03.582]  In fact, I want to play this video, I don't know if we have it queued up yet, of Peter Powers talking in front of Sky News.
[00:41:03.582 --> 00:41:06.503]  I know that one of the guys has it, so we're going to go to that later.
[00:41:06.503 --> 00:41:11.645]  But Peter Powers is in front of Sky News admitting that he's running a private drill.
[00:41:11.645 --> 00:41:13.306]  A private drill!
[00:41:13.306 --> 00:41:15.627]  And he won't say who he's running the drill for.
[00:41:17.165 --> 00:41:21.786]  Of the same exact train stations being bombed at the same exact time.
[00:41:21.786 --> 00:41:31.989]  And this didn't really get covered, of course, anywhere in the mainstream press, but years later, it was 7-7-0-5, it's on the headlines of The Guardian.
[00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:38.691]  July 7th inquest to investigate role of MI5 and police coroner says hearings into deaths of bombers and victims will be heard separately.
[00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:41.632]  A bus destroyed in the July 7th, 2005 attacks in London.
[00:41:45.228 --> 00:41:51.253]  ...are now asking about the role of MI5 in police prior to the 2005 terrorist attacks, a coroner said.
[00:41:51.253 --> 00:41:59.779]  Lady Justice Hollett told the Royal Courts of Justice in central London that the hearings into the deaths of the four bombers would not be heard at the same time of those of their 52 victims.
[00:41:59.779 --> 00:42:09.787]  However, some survivors of the blast were disappointed, and much more than disappointed, folks, I can assure you that, when the coroner refused their request to be able to cross-examine witnesses.
[00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:17.369]  How it had been asked to decide what the forum inquest would take ahead of the hearings later this year.
[00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:19.330]  So I'm wondering if we have that clip ready.
[00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.211]  We still don't have that clip ready.
[00:42:21.211 --> 00:42:22.251]  One second.
[00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:24.652]  I really want to play this because a lot of you are new listeners.
[00:42:24.652 --> 00:42:27.253]  You don't understand how false flag terror works.
[00:42:27.873 --> 00:42:29.674]  And this is how it works.
[00:42:29.674 --> 00:42:33.776]  Private organizations run drills mirroring the actual attacks.
[00:42:33.776 --> 00:42:40.799]  They set up their patsies who have run these drills, you know, four, five, six, sometimes a dozen times, and nothing's happened.
[00:42:40.799 --> 00:42:45.380]  And then, all of a sudden, a train blows up, and radical Islam is to blame.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.381]  So let's hit that clip.
[00:42:47.256 --> 00:43:04.441]  Today we were running an exercise for a company, bearing in mind I'm now in the private sector, and we sat everybody down in the city, a thousand people involved in the whole organisation, but the crisis team, and the most peculiar thing was, we based our scenario on the simultaneous attacks from the London Ground and Main Line station.
[00:43:04.441 --> 00:43:08.702]  So we had to suddenly switch an exercise from fictional to real.
[00:43:08.702 --> 00:43:13.484]  And one of the first things is, get that bureau number, when you have a list of people missing, tell them.
[00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:22.829]  Just to get this right, you are actually working today on an exercise that envisioned virtually this scenario?
[00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:23.549]  Almost precisely.
[00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:28.972]  I was up until 2 o'clock this morning because it's our job, my own company, Pfizer Consultants, we specialize in helping people
[00:43:29.392 --> 00:43:31.013]  ...to get their crisis management response.
[00:43:31.013 --> 00:43:34.034]  How do you jump from slow time thinking to quick time doing?
[00:43:34.034 --> 00:43:42.178]  And we chose a scenario with their assistance which is based on a terrorist attack because they're very close to a property occupied by Jewish businessmen.
[00:43:42.178 --> 00:43:46.640]  They're in the city and there are more American banks in the city than there are in the whole of New York.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.060]  A logical thing to do.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.803]  And it... I've still got the... How extraordinary today must feel for you as it unfolds.
[00:43:53.803 --> 00:43:55.604]  You mentioned a few moments ago there...
[00:43:56.653 --> 00:44:14.890]  Folks, again, this guy is admitting on Fox-owned, Rupert Murdoch-owned Sky News, and he did so on BBC Radio, that visor consultants, his firm, are running drills of blowing up trains at the same exact time, at the same exact place, and this is why
[00:44:16.078 --> 00:44:21.644]  They want to regulate the internet so bad because, you know, that's just a clip that somebody's going to forget a week later.
[00:44:21.644 --> 00:44:23.926]  It's not going to be put into the mainstream media.
[00:44:23.926 --> 00:44:31.494]  But once it's on YouTube, oh wow, all of a sudden hundreds of thousands and millions of people are seeing that and they're waking up to the system.
[00:44:32.034 --> 00:44:37.076]  And that's why they're pushing the Cybersecurity Act here, the Cyberbullying Act, and abroad.
[00:44:37.076 --> 00:44:38.296]  This one's out of the mail online.
[00:44:38.296 --> 00:44:39.976]  Schoolboy15 hangs himself.
[00:44:39.976 --> 00:44:40.236]  Why?
[00:44:40.236 --> 00:44:43.477]  Because of being plagued by online bullies.
[00:44:43.477 --> 00:44:46.618]  And we've seen the same thing going on with MySpace.
[00:44:46.618 --> 00:44:48.779]  And now you're not allowed to have freedom of speech on the Internet.
[00:44:49.159 --> 00:44:59.626]  Miley Cyrus, aka Hannah Montana, says she doesn't like being called fat on her Twitter, so we need to pass rules so Miley Cyrus can feel safe on the Internet.
[00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:00.687]  It's for the children.
[00:45:00.687 --> 00:45:04.830]  Alright, I promised I would go to your calls, so let's go to Annette in West Virginia.
[00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.572]  Annette, what's on your mind?
[00:45:07.572 --> 00:45:09.133]  Good morning.
[00:45:09.133 --> 00:45:11.334]  Actually, good afternoon.
[00:45:11.334 --> 00:45:13.736]  I do have an interesting
[00:45:15.572 --> 00:45:19.674]  A comment with regard to this situation about immigration.
[00:45:19.674 --> 00:45:32.700]  Our nation was founded by a group of people that were homogeneously of one race and they constructed a form of government that was suitable to that race.
[00:45:33.553 --> 00:45:37.296]  I understand that... Woah, woah, woah, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop.
[00:45:37.296 --> 00:45:40.278]  It had nothing to do with race.
[00:45:40.278 --> 00:45:47.604]  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights, after the Civil Rights Act has been passed, I'm not saying that slavery wasn't an abhorrent thing, but it had been taking place across the world.
[00:45:48.905 --> 00:45:51.567]  The Constitution Bill of Rights is for everybody, ma'am.
[00:45:51.567 --> 00:45:54.769]  I, you know, I'm not totally and completely Anglo-American.
[00:45:54.769 --> 00:45:56.110]  It still works for me.
[00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.612]  They didn't set up a system to exclude others.
[00:45:59.612 --> 00:46:07.678]  They set up a system where everybody had the right to pursuit of happiness, to freedom of speech, to being a part of the system.
[00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:11.881]  And again, I would love to see that come to Mexico, but that's not the case.
[00:46:11.881 --> 00:46:17.326]  I would love to see them adopt our Constitution and Bill of Rights, but that's not what happens.
[00:46:17.326 --> 00:46:19.247]  We become more corrupt.
[00:46:19.247 --> 00:46:23.951]  Our economy goes more towards a third world and second world nation when we merge with these.
[00:46:23.951 --> 00:46:25.893]  So that's just a completely ludicrous statement.
[00:46:25.893 --> 00:46:26.914]  Jeremy in California.
[00:46:26.914 --> 00:46:29.736]  Jeremy, you're on the line.
[00:46:29.736 --> 00:46:32.518]  Hey, I actually wanted to make two comments.
[00:46:32.518 --> 00:46:36.281]  The first one was actually a guest request.
[00:46:36.281 --> 00:46:36.582]  It would be
[00:46:37.332 --> 00:46:41.715]  Pretty cool if you guys would interview Dr. Judy Wood sometime about her theory on 9-11.
[00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:43.056]  Alright, sir, I thank you for the call.
[00:46:43.056 --> 00:46:44.677]  Let's go to Carolyn in Florida.
[00:46:44.677 --> 00:46:45.738]  It's unbelievable, man.
[00:46:45.738 --> 00:46:52.603]  We're talking about real issues here, and people want to talk about the most Johnny-nonsense stuff you can possibly imagine.
[00:46:52.603 --> 00:46:55.184]  I'm not even going to get into what that caller wanted to talk about.
[00:46:55.184 --> 00:46:57.586]  Carolyn, Florida, you're on the line.
[00:46:57.586 --> 00:46:57.926]  Hi.
[00:46:57.926 --> 00:46:58.366]  Yes.
[00:46:58.366 --> 00:47:03.390]  I just have a message to the President of Mexico and to our President.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.380]  I always did volunteer work.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:10.841]  I was head of Project Self-Esteem in Southern California School.
[00:47:10.841 --> 00:47:11.802]  Mm-hmm.
[00:47:11.802 --> 00:47:14.282]  I had a young boy come to me, a Mexican boy.
[00:47:14.282 --> 00:47:19.503]  He said he was living with his family, a lot of people, in one apartment.
[00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:19.923]  Mm-hmm.
[00:47:19.923 --> 00:47:21.424]  And they were drug dealers.
[00:47:21.424 --> 00:47:22.224]  Mm-hmm.
[00:47:22.224 --> 00:47:23.504]  And he even carried a gun.
[00:47:23.504 --> 00:47:24.864]  Mm-hmm.
[00:47:24.864 --> 00:47:27.725]  That boy came to me and asked for help.
[00:47:27.725 --> 00:47:28.085]  Mm-hmm.
[00:47:28.085 --> 00:47:29.705]  He was afraid.
[00:47:29.705 --> 00:47:31.366]  He gave me the gun.
[00:47:31.366 --> 00:47:32.246]  I broke it down.
[00:47:33.404 --> 00:47:33.824]  I don't know.
[00:47:59.522 --> 00:48:02.104]  No, I absolutely agree, ma'am, and that's what we need to do.
[00:48:02.104 --> 00:48:03.564]  We do need to help our neighbors.
[00:48:03.564 --> 00:48:07.227]  Look, the majority of my neighbors right now are illegal immigrants.
[00:48:07.227 --> 00:48:08.147]  That's just a fact.
[00:48:08.147 --> 00:48:09.428]  They don't speak English.
[00:48:09.428 --> 00:48:12.089]  I don't hold any ill will towards these people.
[00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:25.537]  When the President of Mexico comes into my country, stands before my Congress, says that we need an assault weapons ban and what people in Arizona are doing is wrong, I find that just unbelievable and incomprehensible.
[00:48:25.537 --> 00:48:28.279]  I think we should be reaching out to our fellow man.
[00:48:28.499 --> 00:48:30.421]  Our fellow human beings out there.
[00:48:30.421 --> 00:48:33.163]  And just because somebody's an illegal Mexican kid, you shouldn't shun them.
[00:48:33.163 --> 00:48:34.885]  I think what you did is great.
[00:48:34.885 --> 00:48:41.831]  And not everybody who comes from Mexico wants to be a gang member, or a thug, or a drug dealer, or take advantage of the system.
[00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:44.333]  But a lot of people do see it as a free ride.
[00:48:44.333 --> 00:48:46.936]  It has nothing to do with their color or their race.
[00:48:46.936 --> 00:48:50.659]  It has everything to do with their economic and political situations.
[00:48:50.659 --> 00:48:51.660]  I appreciate the call.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.181]  Let's go to Shane in Virginia.
[00:48:53.181 --> 00:48:53.842]  Shane, you're on the line.
[00:48:56.365 --> 00:48:57.806]  Yes, Shane.
[00:48:57.806 --> 00:48:58.247]  Hello?
[00:48:58.247 --> 00:48:59.468]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:59.468 --> 00:49:00.349]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:02.050]  Good, what's on your mind?
[00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.332]  Is this the Alex Jones Show?
[00:49:04.332 --> 00:49:05.413]  Yes, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:05.413 --> 00:49:06.574]  What's on your mind, man?
[00:49:06.574 --> 00:49:08.937]  Oh, cool.
[00:49:08.937 --> 00:49:10.138]  You know the red list and the blue list?
[00:49:11.291 --> 00:49:12.432]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[00:49:12.432 --> 00:49:24.600]  Let's go to... Folks, if you want a call about real issues, things that are in the news, if you want a call about patriot mythology and holograms and butterplanes, please go to another show.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.082]  Martin in California, you're on the line.
[00:49:27.082 --> 00:49:28.023]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:28.023 --> 00:49:39.251]  That was an excellent speech by McClintock, but I just want... I had to point out, it's kind of ironic coming from commerceman McClintock, someone he endorsed, CFR Fred Thompson,
[00:49:39.687 --> 00:49:39.967]  Uh huh.
[00:49:39.967 --> 00:49:40.127]  Uh huh.
[00:50:06.847 --> 00:50:11.629]  After Schwarzenegger signed anti-gun bills and numerous other horrible things.
[00:50:11.629 --> 00:50:14.510]  So the Klinot gives great speeches.
[00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.812]  He's an establishment man and a phony and I don't trust him and I don't like him.
[00:50:17.812 --> 00:50:21.253]  And this is coming from a steadfast supporter of the Klinot for many years.
[00:50:21.673 --> 00:50:22.494]  No, I hear you.
[00:50:22.494 --> 00:50:24.236]  Look, I'm going to say this right now.
[00:50:24.236 --> 00:50:29.702]  I don't know enough about his policies, especially over the last 10 years, to say whether or not this guy is a good guy.
[00:50:29.702 --> 00:50:36.771]  But what he put down in that speech, the one we're showing right now at InfoWars.com about Calderon's visit,
[00:50:37.111 --> 00:50:49.188]  was spot on and you know sometimes I have to take issue with things say Michelle Bachman does on the war but she's good on other issues so again we have to look for these bits of truth to show other people what's really going on.
[00:50:49.188 --> 00:50:50.389]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:50.389 --> 00:50:51.311]  We'll be back after this.
[00:50:51.311 --> 00:50:53.173]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:51:01.428 --> 00:51:02.669]  Global meltdowns.
[00:51:02.669 --> 00:51:04.090]  Massive unemployment.
[00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.290]  Endless wars.
[00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:06.932]  A new currency crisis.
[00:51:06.932 --> 00:51:09.033]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:51:09.033 --> 00:51:11.174]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:51:11.174 --> 00:51:13.075]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:51:13.075 --> 00:51:15.157]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[00:51:15.157 --> 00:51:17.138]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[00:51:17.138 --> 00:51:23.282]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:51:23.622 --> 00:51:28.905]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.

[00:52:00.782 --> 00:52:05.764]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.764 --> 00:52:06.744]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.744 --> 00:52:09.205]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.205 --> 00:52:10.205]  A republic.
[00:52:10.205 --> 00:52:12.846]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.846 --> 00:52:15.126]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.126 --> 00:52:17.147]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.147 --> 00:52:18.828]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.828 --> 00:52:20.148]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.148 --> 00:52:20.748]  Children?
[00:52:20.748 --> 00:52:21.869]  Our education?
[00:52:21.869 --> 00:52:22.689]  Our money?
[00:52:22.689 --> 00:52:26.350]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.716 --> 00:52:30.419]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.419 --> 00:52:31.700]  You are being warned.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:32.720]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.881]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.881 --> 00:52:34.782]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.782 --> 00:52:35.662]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.662 --> 00:52:37.924]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.183 --> 00:52:38.623]  Let's talk tough.
[00:52:38.623 --> 00:52:39.164]  Let's talk comfort.
[00:53:04.813 --> 00:53:07.195]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[00:53:07.195 --> 00:53:10.118]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[00:53:10.118 --> 00:53:12.139]  Like you wore as a kid.
[00:53:12.139 --> 00:53:13.020]  Remember?
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:27.893]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sow pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:53:30.072 --> 00:53:40.839]  We're good old-fashioned comfort.
[00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:42.580]  Get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.101]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:47.344]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.
[00:53:47.344 --> 00:53:48.164]  See them at gusset.com.
[00:53:48.164 --> 00:53:49.325]  That's gusset.com.
[00:53:49.325 --> 00:53:49.885]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[00:53:49.885 --> 00:53:50.186]  That's 888-848-7738.
[00:53:50.186 --> 00:53:51.086]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:53:51.086 --> 00:53:51.446]  Others don't.
[00:53:59.872 --> 00:53:59.957]  Yeah.
[00:54:12.915 --> 00:54:13.675]  We are back!
[00:54:13.675 --> 00:54:14.496]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:14.496 --> 00:54:22.980]  I am Jason Vermas, sitting in May 21st, Friday, 2010, and we are taking your calls.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:27.122]  Before we do that, I want to go back to this Rand Paul situation.
[00:54:27.122 --> 00:54:30.463]  He dominates this Senate primary.
[00:54:30.463 --> 00:54:38.147]  He is the face, the face of a constitutional republic, the face of hope for this patriot movement.
[00:54:39.434 --> 00:54:40.094]  And what do they say?
[00:54:40.094 --> 00:54:41.275]  Oh, he's a racist.
[00:54:41.275 --> 00:54:42.635]  He's against civil rights.
[00:54:42.635 --> 00:54:50.018]  And we're going to play this clip of Wolf Blitzer talking to Rand Paul, really grilling him, trying to get him to admit his guilt.
[00:54:50.018 --> 00:54:51.818]  Oh, you're a bad person, Rand.
[00:54:51.818 --> 00:54:52.539]  Just admit it.
[00:54:52.539 --> 00:54:55.280]  And we're going to discuss that with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.880]  But you can see the headlines.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.122]  Tea Party candidate faces civil rights controversy.
[00:55:01.122 --> 00:55:03.623]  Ooh, he's a civil rights controversy.
[00:55:03.623 --> 00:55:04.423]  He's just saying, look,
[00:55:05.143 --> 00:55:07.724]  People have the right to their private establishments.
[00:55:07.724 --> 00:55:10.966]  After all, the Bohemian Grove doesn't let women in do it.
[00:55:10.966 --> 00:55:11.826]  No, it doesn't.
[00:55:11.826 --> 00:55:13.507]  That's very odd.
[00:55:13.507 --> 00:55:19.210]  Their membership is mainly white and it's 3,000 people around the world that really make global decisions.
[00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:19.850]  How odd.
[00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:24.372]  They're allowed to have their private organizations, but others are not.
[00:55:24.372 --> 00:55:29.034]  Alright, let's take a couple more callers before Paul Joseph Watson comes in at the top of the hour.
[00:55:29.034 --> 00:55:29.995]  Bill in New York.
[00:55:29.995 --> 00:55:31.996]  Bill, you're on the line.
[00:55:31.996 --> 00:55:33.717]  Let's go to Jack in San Diego.
[00:55:33.717 --> 00:55:34.337]  Jack, you're on the line.
[00:55:35.197 --> 00:55:44.090]  I wanted to disagree with something about Machete that's been put out by you guys over the last few days and that is that the film got
[00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:49.152]  Okay, let's stop you.
[00:55:49.152 --> 00:55:49.992]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:55:49.992 --> 00:55:59.960]  I'm going to let you talk, but I'm going to tell you straight up that Rob Due called their office, said he was a filmmaker, was looking for funding, asked how he could apply for funding.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.202]  She asked him, well, what type of a movie is it?
[00:56:02.202 --> 00:56:04.303]  He said it was an action-adventure film.
[00:56:04.303 --> 00:56:08.226]  She then asked him, well, could you give me an example of perhaps a film that's shot in Austin?
[00:56:08.226 --> 00:56:09.467]  I can give you a better idea.
[00:56:09.467 --> 00:56:10.788]  And he said Machete.
[00:56:10.788 --> 00:56:11.569]  And she said, oh yeah.
[00:56:11.849 --> 00:56:12.990]  They're part of our program.
[00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:14.530]  I forget what the program was called.
[00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:17.612]  And she admitted on the phone that they had received funds.
[00:56:17.612 --> 00:56:29.997]  And then basically our story went viral on Drudge and all of a sudden, her supervisor called us up and we put his comments at the bottom of the article saying, hey, this guy is denying what's going on, but they got the funding, man.
[00:56:29.997 --> 00:56:34.679]  You're going to tell me these people didn't apply for the Austin credits?
[00:56:34.679 --> 00:56:36.620]  What I'm saying is you're being disingenuous.
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.622]  Every state in the Southwest has a big film commission.
[00:56:41.087 --> 00:56:43.269]  They're competing to take production out of Hollywood.
[00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:44.669]  I work in film.
[00:56:44.669 --> 00:56:45.730]  And that's what this is about.
[00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:48.752]  This is about giving tax credits to bring production into a local community.
[00:56:48.752 --> 00:56:49.673]  But that's the point, sir!
[00:56:49.673 --> 00:56:54.116]  They're getting tax credits to promote an agenda which is racist!
[00:56:54.116 --> 00:56:56.738]  It's a racist... Listen, I like Robert Rodriguez.
[00:56:56.738 --> 00:56:59.840]  I'm a fan of the Desperado films, no matter how ridiculous they are.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.441]  I'm a huge fan of the Sin City movies.
[00:57:02.441 --> 00:57:09.082]  I'm sure that this one is probably going to be a fun romp once you can get past all the racist connotations out there.
[00:57:09.082 --> 00:57:13.724]  But the fact of the matter is, this movie was made in Austin and it did receive tax credits.
[00:57:13.724 --> 00:57:14.944]  That's what we're saying.
[00:57:14.944 --> 00:57:16.304]  Why are we being disingenuous, man?
[00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:21.386]  Yeah, um... I was wondering if anybody's heard about the...
[00:57:50.058 --> 00:57:58.764]  Uh, re-implemented, uh, re-implementation of the Glass-Steagall Act?
[00:57:58.764 --> 00:57:59.945]  Uh, I am not sure.
[00:57:59.945 --> 00:58:02.947]  Uh, you know, you'd probably have to ask Alex Jones about that one.
[00:58:02.947 --> 00:58:04.709]  I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.
[00:58:04.709 --> 00:58:06.450]  Tommy in Scotland.
[00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:12.054]  Tommy, you're on the line.
[00:58:12.054 --> 00:58:12.454]  Good, good.
[00:58:12.454 --> 00:58:13.275]  What's on your mind, Tommy?
[00:58:13.275 --> 00:58:13.455]  Quick.
[00:58:14.929 --> 00:58:15.849]  Yeah, mate.
[00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:17.170]  Thanks a lot for taking my call.
[00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:22.492]  Regarding what you said there about Peter Power, I spoke to him just earlier on this week, actually.
[00:58:22.492 --> 00:58:26.433]  I've got his number to invite him on my radio show.
[00:58:26.433 --> 00:58:29.434]  He refused to go on it, but I spoke to him a few weeks ago.
[00:58:29.434 --> 00:58:30.654]  Tommy, Tommy, hold over!
[00:58:30.654 --> 00:58:31.955]  I'm gonna hold you over.
[00:58:31.955 --> 00:58:37.817]  We're gonna have you in the first part of the segment with Watson coming up to discuss the 7-7 bombings and Peter Power very quickly.
[00:58:37.817 --> 00:58:40.518]  It's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:58:42.401 --> 00:58:45.028]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.028 --> 00:58:48.195]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:53.973]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:53.973 --> 00:58:59.298]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.298 --> 00:59:01.340]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:06.345]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.345 --> 00:59:07.547]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.547 --> 00:59:08.668]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.668 --> 00:59:10.549]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:11.631]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.631 --> 00:59:13.833]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.833 --> 00:59:14.874]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:16.675]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.675 --> 00:59:21.937]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:21.937 --> 00:59:25.518]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.518 --> 00:59:29.340]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:30.580]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.481]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.481 --> 00:59:32.581]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.581 --> 00:59:33.522]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.522 --> 00:59:34.322]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.602 --> 00:59:37.643]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.643 --> 00:59:39.844]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.844 --> 00:59:40.865]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:40.865 --> 00:59:42.065]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:42.065 --> 00:59:43.886]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.171 --> 01:00:10.012]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.012 --> 01:00:11.593]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.593 --> 01:00:13.133]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.133 --> 01:00:17.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.334 --> 01:00:21.976]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.976 --> 01:00:22.576]  We are back.
[01:00:22.576 --> 01:00:23.496]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.496 --> 01:00:24.676]  I am Jason Vermas sitting in.
[01:00:24.676 --> 01:00:29.658]  We're going to have Paul Joseph Watson up in just a moment, but on the line with me is Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.658 --> 01:00:29.838]  Alex?
[01:00:31.058 --> 01:00:33.900]  Hey, yeah, Watson's coming up with key news and info.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:39.623]  I'm taking off today, and Jason, the reason you're getting so many crazy calls is what I've tried to explain to you.
[01:00:39.623 --> 01:00:46.107]  We don't screen phone calls unless it's on a particular subject, and we say we want callers on that subject, so people take advantage of that.
[01:00:46.107 --> 01:00:59.915]  That's why I'm pretty much moving to topic-based calls and specific issues, because we now reach so many millions of people that the haters are the ones that are always going to call in first.
[01:01:00.795 --> 01:01:03.478]  And what that does is then distort what we're covering.
[01:01:03.478 --> 01:01:05.139]  They're going to call in about chupacabras.
[01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:06.820]  They're going to call in about space beams.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:13.886]  They're going to call in about saying we're racist, whatever, to throw us off the issue.
[01:01:13.886 --> 01:01:17.529]  And that's why we mainly just focus on guests and then callers on certain topics.
[01:01:17.529 --> 01:01:25.656]  But the last guy on the whole machete film for stations that just joined us, Robert Rodriguez, has now given an Ain't It Cool News interview.
[01:01:26.818 --> 01:01:32.702]  And it's spun very well, but in the middle of the article he goes ahead and says, you know what?
[01:01:32.702 --> 01:01:41.987]  I have cut a lot of the film out now because it is too real to reality and it's going to be on the DVD extra because it could cause some problems.
[01:01:41.987 --> 01:01:51.713]  And we do have the script and it is a race war film and does paint Hispanics as savages and as white people as a bunch of racists.
[01:01:51.713 --> 01:01:53.915]  It was Hispanic members of his crew that were concerned.
[01:01:54.463 --> 01:01:56.144]  We called the Texas Film Commission.
[01:01:56.144 --> 01:01:57.925]  They said they're funding it.
[01:01:57.925 --> 01:02:00.566]  I live here in Austin, okay, and I've met Rodriguez.
[01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:04.409]  You know, I'm friends with the people in the Film Commission.
[01:02:04.409 --> 01:02:07.050]  I know all about it, and I know he is the darling.
[01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:09.291]  They have different tiers of funding.
[01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:17.176]  That's why when they were going to produce Waco, that's coming out this year, a big film, it didn't get the funding because the state commission said no.
[01:02:17.176 --> 01:02:21.218]  So it's disingenuous to call in and say everyone gets funding.
[01:02:21.218 --> 01:02:23.019]  This is getting multi-tiers.
[01:02:23.837 --> 01:02:24.157]  I don't
[01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:43.827]  We're good to go.
[01:03:02.597 --> 01:03:07.040]  We put the Governor's statement saying, well, we haven't decided whether to fund it.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.201]  We'll decide that at the end.
[01:03:09.201 --> 01:03:10.682]  And we went and showed how that's a lie.
[01:03:10.682 --> 01:03:13.844]  They begin authorizing funding at the beginning.
[01:03:13.844 --> 01:03:22.068]  And so, no, they refuse fully 30 plus percent, according to the Associated Press, of Film Commission money in Texas.
[01:03:22.068 --> 01:03:28.412]  So to say that everybody gets it is a lie and is disingenuous.
[01:03:28.412 --> 01:03:29.573]  And again, you lose
[01:03:30.017 --> 01:03:31.358]  You fail, caller.
[01:03:31.358 --> 01:03:33.319]  We're not the ones being disingenuous.
[01:03:33.319 --> 01:03:36.801]  You're the one that's either ignorant or being disingenuous.
[01:03:36.801 --> 01:03:41.584]  And, you know, quite frankly, I don't want to influence this film.
[01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.385]  I was contacted by people that were concerned.
[01:03:43.385 --> 01:03:52.750]  And if you go read his new Ain't It Cool News interview I'm going to be covering this Sunday, he admits that he's now going to cut these parts and put it in the DVD extra.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.783]  Because it is too real to life.
[01:03:56.783 --> 01:04:15.096]  This film has race war in it, at a time when this country is on its edge, and at a time we have the Mexican president telling us to ban semi-automatic rifles, and telling us to open our borders up, and the president is a traitor, saying that we don't have borders anymore in America.
[01:04:15.096 --> 01:04:16.437]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:04:16.437 --> 01:04:19.459]  America is being swallowed by the New World Order.
[01:04:19.864 --> 01:04:26.769]  By globalist offshore, we've all got to come together against this and expose this situation.
[01:04:26.769 --> 01:04:28.530]  And Jason, you're doing a great job.
[01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:29.991]  Paul Watson is coming up.
[01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:31.352]  Then, of course, Bob Chapman.
[01:04:31.352 --> 01:04:37.416]  And I'll be back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., right before you do your Sunday three hours, Jason.
[01:04:38.052 --> 01:04:39.193]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:04:39.193 --> 01:04:40.314]  We're going to come back.
[01:04:40.314 --> 01:04:47.460]  We're going to talk about Rand Paul's victory and the vicious media attacks against him with Paul Joseph Watson and so much more.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:51.664]  It's the Alex Jones Show only at Infowars.com and streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.342 --> 01:05:05.305]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:05:05.305 --> 01:05:06.306]  What have we got?
[01:05:06.306 --> 01:05:08.747]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:05:08.747 --> 01:05:09.748]  A republic.
[01:05:09.748 --> 01:05:12.410]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:14.671]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:16.692]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:05:16.692 --> 01:05:18.373]  So they think they own our land?
[01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:19.694]  They think they own our water?
[01:05:19.694 --> 01:05:20.294]  Children?
[01:05:20.294 --> 01:05:21.415]  Our education?
[01:05:21.415 --> 01:05:22.256]  Our money?
[01:05:22.256 --> 01:05:25.898]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:05:26.258 --> 01:05:31.245]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:05:31.245 --> 01:05:32.266]  We have the facts.
[01:05:32.266 --> 01:05:33.427]  We have the Constitution.
[01:05:33.427 --> 01:05:34.329]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:05:34.329 --> 01:05:35.210]  We have common law.
[01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:37.753]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:37.753 --> 01:05:41.518]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:05:41.618 --> 01:05:46.580]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.081]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:05:48.081 --> 01:05:49.161]  Don't tread on me.
[01:05:49.161 --> 01:05:56.044]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:04.437]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:06:04.437 --> 01:06:10.840]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:18.222]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[01:06:18.222 --> 01:06:23.104]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:25.225]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-625-7000.
[01:06:25.885 --> 01:06:28.349]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:46.671]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:58.999]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:06:58.999 --> 01:06:59.379]  Thank you.
[01:07:01.294 --> 01:07:09.758]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:07:09.758 --> 01:07:20.662]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:26.085]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:07:26.645 --> 01:07:31.528]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:07:31.528 --> 01:07:40.614]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:07:40.614 --> 01:07:50.721]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:07:50.721 --> 01:07:54.404]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:55.424]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:06.971]  Big Brother.
[01:08:06.971 --> 01:08:08.752]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:10.514]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.514 --> 01:08:12.095]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:13.637]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.637 --> 01:08:17.841]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.841 --> 01:08:21.884]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:23.686]  We are back.
[01:08:23.686 --> 01:08:24.567]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.388]  I am Jason Burmess sitting in.
[01:08:26.388 --> 01:08:28.830]  We have Paul Joseph Watson on hold.
[01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:33.354]  We're going to go to him about Rand Paul's victory and now the vicious media attacks in just a moment.
[01:08:33.354 --> 01:08:39.739]  We also have Tommy Inscollin who I briefly want to go to about the seven attacks, but just finishing up on the machete point.
[01:08:40.299 --> 01:08:51.087]  Okay, in my hands, and hopefully we're going to go to the document camp for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, I have Rodriguez with the guy signing his incentives program.
[01:08:51.087 --> 01:08:53.148]  Look, here's the incentives bill signing.
[01:08:53.148 --> 01:08:57.231]  Robert Rodriguez reveals his next project as film incentives bill signing.
[01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:59.293]  He is the model!
[01:08:59.293 --> 01:09:00.434]  Machete was the model!
[01:09:00.754 --> 01:09:01.974]  For this program.
[01:09:01.974 --> 01:09:06.516]  And if you don't believe me, here's the other headline out of San Antonio News.
[01:09:06.516 --> 01:09:11.158]  Austin was also the site of the production for Robert Rodriguez's directed movie, Machete.
[01:09:11.158 --> 01:09:15.760]  The project was announced shortly after the film, Incentives Were Creative.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.020]  Oh!
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.341]  It was announced right after these film, Incentives Were Creative.
[01:09:18.341 --> 01:09:23.603]  And Hudgens, the head of it, said the announcement was symbolic for the incentive program.
[01:09:24.463 --> 01:09:26.704]  So again, he is the model.
[01:09:26.704 --> 01:09:28.125]  There is no debating.
[01:09:28.125 --> 01:09:30.246]  We're not being disingenuous.
[01:09:30.246 --> 01:09:33.568]  I understand it's about the bottom line, but we're not distorting anything, sir.
[01:09:33.568 --> 01:09:36.770]  So let's go back to Tommy and Scotland very, very quickly.
[01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:38.091]  And you talked to Peter Power.
[01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:51.319]  We played the clip in the last hour of Peter Power's talking about the drills that visor consultants were running for private organizations of the same exact train stations blowing up and buses blowing up at the same exact time.
[01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:51.799]  Go ahead, Tommy.
[01:09:53.021 --> 01:10:01.107]  Yeah, when I spoke to him, I was trying to get another interview with him, but when I did that a few weeks ago, and he said, oh, you're a bit late, are you not?
[01:10:01.107 --> 01:10:01.907]  I said, excuse me?
[01:10:01.907 --> 01:10:03.788]  He said, well, it was five years ago.
[01:10:03.788 --> 01:10:06.090]  And then I said, well, look, it's just I've got certain concerns.
[01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.852]  He said, oh, you're not one of these mad conspiracy theorists.
[01:10:08.852 --> 01:10:10.073]  I said, look, I'm a journalist.
[01:10:11.242 --> 01:10:13.663]  And then later on he questioned me and I was asking him a few more things.
[01:10:13.663 --> 01:10:16.405]  He said, you know, I'm getting really worried, I don't think you really are a journalist.
[01:10:16.405 --> 01:10:34.513]  I said, well look, I've got my own website, I say, in alternative media, and I've got my own radio station, and I quizzed him on it, and I said, well can you tell me, I said, because it's one hell of a coincidence that you could be pulling off drills at the same time when, you know, these things happened.
[01:10:34.513 --> 01:10:36.694]  And he said, well look, do you think I would seriously
[01:10:37.074 --> 01:10:37.454]  We're good to go.
[01:10:58.613 --> 01:11:06.620]  He's part of the Illegitimate Illuminati, so he's part of the inside job that happened on that day, and real questions should be answered.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:11.804]  Tommy, Tommy, let me stop you, let me just, let me just stop you and hopefully you can call into my Sunday show and maybe we can do a half an hour on it.
[01:11:11.804 --> 01:11:12.665]  I should schedule that.
[01:11:12.665 --> 01:11:17.168]  So maybe we can have you on my Sunday show so we can discuss this, because this is the headline out of The Guardian today.
[01:11:17.168 --> 01:11:21.792]  July 7th inquest to investigate role of MI5 and police.
[01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:24.274]  I now want to go to Paul Joseph Watts.
[01:11:24.274 --> 01:11:25.996]  We may discuss this later, but
[01:11:26.536 --> 01:11:29.719]  Paul, I really want to start off with the media attacks.
[01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:37.244]  Now that Rand Paul has won, and it looks like he's going to take that Senate seat, now he's against civil rights, now he's a racist.
[01:11:37.244 --> 01:11:37.985]  Let's talk about it.
[01:11:37.985 --> 01:11:51.716]  Yeah, well, it's kind of all summed up by a Politico article headline, which I read yesterday, called Activist Seize Control of Politics, and that describes how
[01:11:52.472 --> 01:12:06.304]  Establishment office holders in these recent elections have basically been ejected in a kind of retching convulsion at the status quo, you know, as this popular sentiment continues to rise.
[01:12:06.304 --> 01:12:14.411]  Now, the establishment is in a blind, complete stupor and panic about what to do over Rand Paul's success.
[01:12:15.223 --> 01:12:23.285]  Even though, you know, he's not even Senator yet, he's still got to beat his Democratic opponent, Jack Conway, in November.
[01:12:23.285 --> 01:12:32.847]  But now we see Rand Paul being feathered and tarred about ten times more, about a hundred times more than Elaine Kagan.
[01:12:32.847 --> 01:12:44.069]  I mean, on the one hand you have Kagan, who, you know, her every view on the Second Amendment, free speech, you know, her office argued to ban books, ban political pamphlets,
[01:12:45.191 --> 01:12:49.695]  She wants Americans held without trial, detained without trial.
[01:12:49.695 --> 01:12:52.557]  Her every view is completely abhorrent to the U.S.
[01:12:52.557 --> 01:13:03.887]  Constitution, and yet the corporate media is giving her such a soft ride, compared to Rand Paul, who goes on MSNBC with Rachel Maddow a couple of days ago.
[01:13:04.784 --> 01:13:15.693]  He intellectually disagrees with one out of the ten titles of the Civil Rights Act about preventing the government from regulating the First Amendment's private businesses.
[01:13:15.693 --> 01:13:21.198]  He's not saying he's going to revoke the Civil Rights Act, as the debunkers have all claimed.
[01:13:21.198 --> 01:13:28.324]  So, Maddow tried to back him into a corner for 20 minutes on this issue, and then the day after,
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:57.551]  Just about the entire corporate media and today the LA Times front page purely devoted to attacking Rand Paul and of course followed by all the neo-lib George Soros blogs launch into him and try to insinuate that Rand Paul is some kind of Klan member because he holds a position which as an article we posted about half an hour ago on PrisonPlanet.com proves
[01:13:58.348 --> 01:14:04.709]  is the mainstream libertarian position on the Civil Rights Act.
[01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:18.532]  They've interviewed professors and top scholars at universities who have all said that Rand Paul's position is part of a mainstream libertarian viewpoint on this issue.
[01:14:18.532 --> 01:14:20.652]  So you've got that going on.
[01:14:20.652 --> 01:14:27.133]  MSNBC yesterday aired no less than eight different segments with guests
[01:14:27.662 --> 01:14:34.184]  Such as, uh, Jesse Jackson, James Clyburn, and all these Democratic operatives.
[01:14:34.184 --> 01:14:37.825]  Eight different segments, all attacking Ron Paul.
[01:14:37.825 --> 01:14:43.627]  Not one person did the interview who defended Ron Paul, or was even neutral.
[01:14:43.627 --> 01:14:55.750]  But, the fact is that all these smear tactics are not having much success because, as we've posted also on PrisonPointer.com, Rasmussen reports, the big polling agency,
[01:14:56.929 --> 01:15:04.752]  That Rand Paul is 25 points ahead of his Democratic Parliament Jack Conway in this early stage.
[01:15:04.752 --> 01:15:16.737]  Obviously there's still many months to go until the November election but he's 25 points ahead even in the aftermath of all these racist smears.
[01:15:16.737 --> 01:15:24.160]  So it proves once again that the establishment media and their operatives are coming out with this stuff from a
[01:15:25.046 --> 01:15:25.266]  I'm good.
[01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:50.765]  And they did similar things to his father while he was running for president saying, you know, he hated Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:15:50.765 --> 01:15:57.730]  and they pointed to a couple newsletters that other people had written and his father was a racist and now Rand Paul is a racist.
[01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:03.233]  Let me read what Jack Conway, his Senate opponent, had to say in the LA Times.
[01:16:03.233 --> 01:16:09.197]  Promoting a narrow and rigid ideology and has repeatedly rejected a fundamental provision of the Civil Rights Act.
[01:16:09.597 --> 01:16:15.842]  No matter how he tries to spin to the contrary the fact that Paul's ideology has dangerous consequences for who?
[01:16:15.842 --> 01:16:22.466]  Working families, veterans, students, the disabled, and those without a voice in the halls of power.
[01:16:22.466 --> 01:16:30.572]  It seems to me we're the ones without a voice in the halls of power because our Congress and our Senate no longer represent the people.
[01:16:30.572 --> 01:16:32.593]  We do not have a government for and by the people.
[01:16:32.593 --> 01:16:37.497]  We do not have checks and balances in our system and we certainly don't have a lot of people
[01:16:37.717 --> 01:16:39.519]  No, and that's why the establishment hates his guts.
[01:16:45.859 --> 01:16:51.520]  And I mean, the quote you just read from Conway is, you know, it echoes the rhetoric coming out.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:58.282]  People are basically insinuating that Rand Paul wants to create restaurants where black people aren't allowed in them.
[01:16:58.282 --> 01:17:06.963]  They're saying he wants to throw out the Civil Rights Act and reinforce segregation, which of course is complete and up to baloney.
[01:17:06.963 --> 01:17:14.125]  If anyone tried to set up a business or a restaurant that wouldn't serve black people, it'd get picketed, shut down, and
[01:17:14.605 --> 01:17:17.747]  You know, people wouldn't patronize it in an instant.
[01:17:17.747 --> 01:17:29.436]  So, the attacks are completely made up, but the fact that they're being echoed across every corporate media rag just shows you how desperate they are to smear Ron Paul.
[01:17:29.436 --> 01:17:39.544]  And you can tell that this was contrived because in the very hours after his victory, his crushing victory over the neocon stooge that ran against him,
[01:17:40.515 --> 01:17:50.962]  They tried to attack Ron Paul because he held his victory celebration in a country club and they said that this was some kind of racist, elitist thing to do.
[01:17:50.962 --> 01:17:59.388]  So right from the very start they were trying to contrive race baiting and attack him on these racial angles.
[01:17:59.388 --> 01:18:02.850]  The country club thing was pathetic, it didn't work.
[01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:03.631]  So now you had
[01:18:04.088 --> 01:18:07.849]  Maddow, try and push him into a corner on this civil rights thing.
[01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:21.012]  And despite the fact that Ron Rand Paul has eloquently defended his position, which again is backed up by mainstream libertarians, the libertarian icon, the late Harry Brown, held the same position.
[01:18:21.012 --> 01:18:25.213]  You have Ron Rand Paul eloquently defending himself, but they're still going with it.
[01:18:25.213 --> 01:18:30.274]  But just like the country club, Mia, I think it'll wash away very quickly.
[01:18:30.274 --> 01:18:31.034]  But what I find
[01:18:32.265 --> 01:18:40.013]  Amazingly hypocritical is the fact that this originated from Rachel Maddow of MSNBC.
[01:18:40.013 --> 01:18:48.401]  And this is a woman who 80% of her paycheck comes from the owners of NBCUniversal, General Electric.
[01:18:49.522 --> 01:18:56.127]  Who's primary business activity is manufacturing bombs to be dropped on brown people in the Middle East and the Third World.
[01:18:56.127 --> 01:19:06.834]  So, she's paid by a contractor whose business is to slaughter brown people and yet Rand Paul is the big racist because he thinks government shouldn't stick its nose into private business.
[01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:09.316]  A little bit hypocritical there, I might say.
[01:19:09.941 --> 01:19:32.618]  I would say so as well, and unfortunately the establishment media over at MSNBC, it was okay to criticize the war when it was under the Bush administration, and it was okay to point out all these infractions in civil liberties and our privacy and our freedom, but now that Barack Obama's in, it's okay to be in the Middle East, and we need to attack anybody who may oppose democratic power, Paul.
[01:19:32.618 --> 01:19:33.159]  Well, that's right.
[01:19:34.082 --> 01:19:35.923]  I mean, you see it from every angle.
[01:19:35.923 --> 01:19:37.865]  I mean, Olbermann is terrible now.
[01:19:37.865 --> 01:19:48.253]  He was really good when Bush was in power, but as soon as Obama got in, as we predicted before what happened, they just switched straight away, and they start supporting whoever's in power.
[01:19:48.253 --> 01:19:49.434]  We'll be back after this.
[01:19:49.434 --> 01:19:50.555]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:50.555 --> 01:19:51.836]  I'm Jason Burmess, sitting in.
[01:19:51.836 --> 01:19:53.137]  We're with Paul Joseph Watson.

[01:21:59.781 --> 01:22:00.342]  Good day.
[01:22:00.342 --> 01:22:02.204]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:02.204 --> 01:22:02.525]  May 21st, 2010.
[01:22:02.525 --> 01:22:03.586]  Gold opened this morning at $11.8280.
[01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:06.790]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.1462, $6.0731 for a half-ounce, or $3.0365 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:07.591]  That's $12.1462, $6.0731, and $3.0365.
[01:22:19.406 --> 01:22:22.330]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:26.555]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[01:22:26.555 --> 01:22:31.441]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:31.441 --> 01:22:37.528]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[01:22:37.768 --> 01:22:38.028]  I think so.
[01:23:00.117 --> 01:23:03.119]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:23:03.119 --> 01:23:05.181]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:23:05.181 --> 01:23:07.943]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:23:07.943 --> 01:23:10.165]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:23:10.165 --> 01:23:11.586]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.487]  But first, the facts.
[01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:17.410]  67 other products merely treat symptoms and not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:21.093]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:23:21.093 --> 01:23:28.838]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:29.459]  Sinofresh.

[01:23:50.386 --> 01:23:50.646]  It works!
[01:24:01.856 --> 01:24:04.597]  Man thinks, cause he rules it up
[01:24:07.714 --> 01:24:09.315]  We are back!
[01:24:09.315 --> 01:24:10.175]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:10.175 --> 01:24:12.716]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting for Alex Jones.
[01:24:12.716 --> 01:24:14.236]  We have Paul Joseph Watson on the line.
[01:24:14.236 --> 01:24:19.779]  We're going to go back to him in just a moment, but I want to thank some of our great sponsors that make this show today possible.
[01:24:19.779 --> 01:24:21.259]  Ecoloblue.com.
[01:24:21.259 --> 01:24:24.160]  That's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.141]  You can call them at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:24:25.141 --> 01:24:25.821]  That's right.
[01:24:25.821 --> 01:24:27.741]  It's fresh drinking water made from thin,
[01:24:32.063 --> 01:24:55.641]  air almost ever it's up to seven and a half gallons of fresh water per day per day this is not a water filtration system well it is because it's got seven to twelve filters inside of it but it pulls the water from the air you do not have to hook it to a source it's the best tasting water I've ever drank in my life we drink it on the reg here in the office the cola blue.com 1-800-691-6868
[01:24:57.742 --> 01:25:23.644]  zero four three and I want to tell you guys about weapons universe dot com hey folks we have a new sponsor that you're just gonna love these folks have everything you can imagine for your self-defense needs that you need to get whether you need knives or stun guns blowguns collapsible batons they have it at weapons universe dot com so go check it for all your security needs all right now going back
[01:25:24.616 --> 01:25:25.637]  Indeed he did, and then
[01:25:52.594 --> 01:25:58.216]  The people who started to criticize him, they were called racist for using the word socialism.
[01:25:58.216 --> 01:26:02.077]  So, they only choose to race-bait when it suits their cause.
[01:26:02.077 --> 01:26:04.218]  And you're right, I mean it's everywhere.
[01:26:04.218 --> 01:26:13.021]  The LA Times front page, like you said, um, MSNBC, no less than eight different segments yesterday on it, all attacking him.
[01:26:13.021 --> 01:26:19.123]  And also, the Obama campaign group, Organizing for America, has, um,
[01:26:19.628 --> 01:26:43.668]  He sent out a mass email saying that Rand Paul supports segregation and that this should cause a quote massive public outcry which then provoked Rand Paul to have to issue a statement saying he doesn't want to repeal the Civil Rights Act just because he intellectually disagrees with the scope of one out of the ten titles of it.
[01:26:43.668 --> 01:26:45.009]  I mean it's ridiculous.
[01:26:45.009 --> 01:26:48.452]  It's transparently a contrived attack.
[01:26:49.082 --> 01:26:57.306]  And I'm sure that once this comes to light, as it already is being brought to light, that they'll move on to something else.
[01:26:57.306 --> 01:27:09.011]  And they've already floated that with this David Corn character, which I'm sure that you've come across in the course of your 9-11 research.
[01:27:09.011 --> 01:27:14.294]  And this is an ultimate neoliberal establishment insider who
[01:27:15.209 --> 01:27:20.353]  Every major juncture acts as an apologist for the establishment.
[01:27:20.353 --> 01:27:29.318]  He denied that there was any warning prior to 9-11 about pre-attack intelligence, something which has been proven in Triplicate.
[01:27:29.318 --> 01:27:34.562]  You know, he attacked Gary Webb for exposing CIA drug running.
[01:27:34.562 --> 01:27:38.644]  He poses as a liberal, and yet he's a neocon lie.
[01:27:38.644 --> 01:27:39.785]  He's a statist.
[01:27:39.785 --> 01:27:42.627]  Again, he supports whoever's in power and what they do.
[01:27:43.447 --> 01:27:56.329]  So now he's come out with this article out of the nation saying that basically Rand Paul's paranoid, delusional, and dangerous because he's made some appearances on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:56.329 --> 01:28:04.651]  And because, like, six of the ten actual 9-11 commissioners, we talk about, you know, 9-11 being a cover-up.
[01:28:04.651 --> 01:28:11.592]  Which supposedly, in Korn's worldview, which is about five or six years past its sell-by date,
[01:28:12.205 --> 01:28:18.846]  Makes Rand Paul, this paranoid nutcase conspiracy theorist, unfit to be a senator.
[01:28:18.846 --> 01:28:21.807]  Well, we know that's absolutely unbelievable.
[01:28:21.807 --> 01:28:22.767]  You look at the evidence.
[01:28:22.767 --> 01:28:28.968]  They're running drills of planes being hijacked and driven into buildings at the same exact time, just like the 7-7 bombings.
[01:28:28.968 --> 01:28:34.229]  And again, the inquest into the 7-7 bombings is now going to look at the MI5 role.
[01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:35.409]  Expect a whitewash.
[01:28:35.409 --> 01:28:38.170]  The bottom line is, the establishment out there has about
[01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:39.371]  I don't know.
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:29:11.712]  Paul, over the next five to six months, I think they're going to keep pounding the pavement, pounding the pavement, asking the same question again and again and again until they get a response that they can distort in a manner that they can blow it up all over the mainstream like when Howard Dean went, yeah!
[01:29:11.712 --> 01:29:14.014]  And they said, wow, look at this crazy person.
[01:29:14.014 --> 01:29:15.515]  He can't be the president.
[01:29:15.515 --> 01:29:16.636]  I'm not a fan of Howard Dean.
[01:29:16.636 --> 01:29:20.319]  I just saw the media turn on somebody with one act and they're going to be
[01:29:21.019 --> 01:29:22.880]  Waiting fervently for that act.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.980]  So when we come back, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:32.983]  We're going to play the clip of Wolf Blitzer basically saying, you're guilty, you don't like civil rights, you're bad, aren't you Rand Paul?
[01:29:32.983 --> 01:29:36.143]  And Rand Paul handles himself impeccably.
[01:29:36.143 --> 01:29:37.964]  We've got Paul Joseph Watson on the line.
[01:29:37.964 --> 01:29:44.186]  It's the Alex Jones Show only at InfoWars.com and streaming via TV live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:51.041 --> 01:29:54.962]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.962 --> 01:30:00.424]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.424 --> 01:30:01.725]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.725 --> 01:30:07.306]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:07.306 --> 01:30:12.328]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:12.328 --> 01:30:17.370]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:23.114]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:23.114 --> 01:30:25.435]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:30:25.435 --> 01:30:30.238]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:30.238 --> 01:30:31.359]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.421]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:30:34.421 --> 01:30:38.044]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.044 --> 01:30:41.246]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:41.246 --> 01:30:43.467]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:50.993]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:50.993 --> 01:30:57.098]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:57.098 --> 01:31:00.461]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:00.461 --> 01:31:07.127]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:07.127 --> 01:31:12.272]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:12.272 --> 01:31:13.733]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:31:16.334 --> 01:31:27.001]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit

[01:31:37.901 --> 01:31:39.122]  Others don't.

[01:31:57.655 --> 01:31:58.516]  Others don't.
[01:32:04.139 --> 01:32:05.400]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:09.122]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.122 --> 01:32:11.564]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.564 --> 01:32:17.427]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.427 --> 01:32:23.671]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.091 --> 01:32:30.072]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.072 --> 01:32:34.253]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.253 --> 01:32:38.534]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.534 --> 01:32:44.475]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:48.035]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.035 --> 01:32:50.016]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.016 --> 01:32:50.436]  It's here.

[01:33:08.772 --> 01:33:11.433]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:11.433 --> 01:33:24.179]  We're going to be going to a clip of Wolf Blitzer grilling Rand Paul, guilty until proven innocent, of course, when you're part of the establishment media, about his racism and he doesn't like civil rights.
[01:33:24.179 --> 01:33:30.323]  But first I want to tell you about my latest and greatest film, Invisible Empire, a new world order defined.
[01:33:30.323 --> 01:33:30.543]  Folks,
[01:33:31.503 --> 01:33:35.646]  This is something I had worked on over the last five years doing research.
[01:33:35.646 --> 01:33:40.389]  Alex Jones was good enough to have me out here in the last year and a half to put this together.
[01:33:40.389 --> 01:33:44.371]  Graphically, I feel it is the best New World Order film out there.
[01:33:44.371 --> 01:33:50.515]  It has hundreds of quotes from the elite establishment, hacks themselves, promoting what?
[01:33:50.515 --> 01:33:51.356]  Global government.
[01:33:51.916 --> 01:34:00.243]  And a new world order, so please get the DVD over at InfoWars.com or become a PrisonPlanet.TV subscriber and watch it in the highest of quality.
[01:34:00.243 --> 01:34:03.066]  Alright, I am going to go to this clip right now.
[01:34:03.066 --> 01:34:08.711]  Here is Blitzer going after Rand Paul, towing the establishment line.
[01:34:10.012 --> 01:34:16.876]  I want to give you a chance to explain because there's a lot of confusion right now about precisely where you stand.
[01:34:16.876 --> 01:34:18.817]  I'll ask you a simple question.
[01:34:18.817 --> 01:34:26.782]  If you had been a member of the Senate or the House back in 1964, would you have voted yay or nay for the Civil Rights Act?
[01:34:28.464 --> 01:34:30.487]  Yes, I would have voted yes.
[01:34:30.487 --> 01:34:34.152]  So why is there all this confusion emerging right now?
[01:34:34.152 --> 01:34:41.962]  Give me your analysis because you've had to issue a statement today, there have been interviews on NPR yesterday and MSNBC.
[01:34:41.962 --> 01:34:43.284]  Tell us what's going on.
[01:34:44.918 --> 01:34:50.961]  Well, first of all, well if I thought I was supposed to get a honeymoon, when does my honeymoon start, you know, after my victory?
[01:34:50.961 --> 01:34:53.282]  No such thing in politics, Dr. Obama.
[01:34:53.282 --> 01:34:54.162]  No such thing.
[01:34:54.162 --> 01:34:55.223]  I think you're right.
[01:34:55.223 --> 01:34:59.965]  I think what troubles me is that the news cycle's gotten out of control.
[01:34:59.965 --> 01:35:08.869]  I mean, for several hours on a major news network yesterday, they reported repeatedly that I was for repealing the Civil Rights Act.
[01:35:09.429 --> 01:35:17.393]  That is not only not true, never been my position, but is an out-and-out lie, and they repeated it all day long.
[01:35:17.393 --> 01:35:22.316]  It started with my Democrat opponent asserting this, but has never been my position.
[01:35:23.348 --> 01:35:48.016]  You support that, because the argument was made that you support the Civil Rights Act in terms of federal, in terms of government responsibilities, there should be no racism or segregation, but if there's a private club or a restaurant where they don't want to serve African Americans, as abhorrent as that is, you think that they have a, you suggested, correct me if I'm wrong, they would have a right to do that.
[01:35:49.858 --> 01:36:00.185]  Well, what I did suggest was that it was a stain on the history of the South and of our country that, you know, we desegregated in 1840 in Boston.
[01:36:00.185 --> 01:36:08.030]  William Lloyd Garrison was up there with Frederick Douglass being thrown off trains and going through what happened in the 1960s in 1840 in Boston.
[01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:19.338]  So I think it is a stain on our history and something that I am sad for and something that, if I had been alive at the time, would hope that I would have been there marching with Martin Luther King.
[01:36:20.098 --> 01:36:35.709]  One of our biggest county coordinators was there with Martin Luther King, attended the rallies in D.C., and considers himself to be a civil rights activist, and he takes it as a personal insult that people will say that our movement doesn't believe in civil rights.
[01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:39.672]  But I just want to be precise on this, Dr. Pollack, I just want to be precise.
[01:36:39.672 --> 01:36:46.557]  Did Woolworth, the department store, have a right at their lunch counters to segregate blacks and whites?
[01:36:48.464 --> 01:37:07.157]  I think that there was an overriding problem in the South that was so big that it did require federal intervention in the 60s, and it stemmed from things that I said, you know, had been going on really 120 years too long, and the southern states weren't correcting it, and I think there was a need for federal intervention.
[01:37:07.157 --> 01:37:13.422]  Alright, so you've clarified, you would have voted yay, you would have voted yes in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
[01:37:13.422 --> 01:37:13.982]  Yes.
[01:37:13.982 --> 01:37:17.224]  Would you also have voted for the Americans with Disabilities Act?
[01:37:19.807 --> 01:37:21.648]  Well, I have some questions about it.
[01:37:21.648 --> 01:37:37.336]  I mean, the one question that comes to mind, to my thinking is, let's say you have a local office and you have a two-story office and one of your workers is handicapped, should you not be allowed maybe to offer them an office on the first floor?
[01:37:37.336 --> 01:37:41.037]  Or should you be forced to put in a $100,000 elevator?
[01:37:41.037 --> 01:37:45.800]  I think that sounds like common sense that you should be allowed maybe to give them a first floor office.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:38:02.348]  I think sometimes when we have a federal solution, we make it one size fits all, and that we recognize the problem, which I do also, of someone who's handicapped, but then we don't take into consideration at all the business owner or the property owner.
[01:38:02.348 --> 01:38:07.871]  So I think it's a balancing act, and I'd have to look at that legislation to see how they balanced it.
[01:38:07.871 --> 01:38:12.894]  But my understanding is, is that small business owners were often forced to put in elevators
[01:38:13.394 --> 01:38:21.206]  And I think you ought to at least be given the choice of can you provide an opportunity without maybe having to pay for an elevator.
[01:38:21.206 --> 01:38:26.594]  So the answer is you don't know for sure if you would have voted yes or no on that Americans for Disabilities Act.
[01:38:27.867 --> 01:38:29.748]  Yeah, I mean, I'd have to look at it and see.
[01:38:29.748 --> 01:38:34.930]  I think you do, it's a balancing act, and I am in favor of trying to have the workplace open.
[01:38:34.930 --> 01:38:37.411]  My office is open to the handicapped.
[01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:42.233]  We try very hard, but it's been open to the handicapped for decades.
[01:38:43.513 --> 01:38:47.396]  You know, it doesn't always take government for people to do the right thing.
[01:38:47.396 --> 01:38:59.945]  Sometimes government has to step in in extraordinary circumstances, but I think a lot of times that the private world can step up and do the right things, or we can find local solutions over federal solutions.
[01:38:59.945 --> 01:39:08.551]  So it's not always whether you oppose something, it's about where the solution should arrive, whether it arrives at the federal government or the local government.
[01:39:09.111 --> 01:39:16.077]  I do think, though, that there is a big civil rights issue out there, and I think the Democrats avoid it, and that's school choice.
[01:39:16.077 --> 01:39:33.630]  I think the biggest thing holding down our inner-city communities is a lack of good education, and I say give them a choice, let them choose to go to a school anywhere in the city or outside the city, and so I think school choice is the civil rights issue of our era, and many people are saying that.
[01:39:34.551 --> 01:39:39.153]  There he is, Rand Paul, taking the grilling from Wolf Blitzer and really breaking it down.
[01:39:39.153 --> 01:39:41.335]  Paul, your thoughts?
[01:39:41.335 --> 01:39:51.960]  Well, people like Wolf Blitzer know that to forward an intellectual argument about something like the Civil Rights Act would take hours.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.141]  You know, it's an academic debate.
[01:39:54.141 --> 01:40:01.265]  He knows that he's got three or four minutes on there, and that in Wolf Blitzer's case, he needs to dumb it down.
[01:40:01.866 --> 01:40:15.031]  And the overall implication that they're trying to heap on Rand Paul is that he hates black people, he's going to repeal the Civil Rights Act, he's going to discriminate against minorities and disabled people.
[01:40:15.031 --> 01:40:17.291]  And that's what they want to put out there.
[01:40:17.291 --> 01:40:27.615]  I mean, you can go and read the fathers of the libertarian movement and professors in universities today who carefully explain where Rand Paul is coming from on this.
[01:40:28.129 --> 01:40:35.079]  But they know that the majority of people watching a three or four minute CNN news segment aren't going to do that.
[01:40:35.079 --> 01:40:39.424]  So they boil it down, they dumb it down, and they throw it out as a smear.
[01:40:39.424 --> 01:40:41.848]  And that's exactly what's happened over the past few days.
[01:40:42.608 --> 01:40:50.150]  And if you listen to what he says, especially at the end, he's actually for minorities being able to pick their own schooling.
[01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:55.391]  If anybody's ever been into the inner city of New York, of course, it's largely minority-based.
[01:40:55.391 --> 01:41:00.372]  And he's saying, well, those kids should have a choice at a real education, and the majority do not.
[01:41:00.372 --> 01:41:04.313]  And talking about that as a real civil rights issue, that's not on the headlines, Paul.
[01:41:05.731 --> 01:41:09.553]  Well, exactly, and I mean, he's got nothing to defend himself against.
[01:41:09.553 --> 01:41:16.275]  That's what Ron Paul said, and it's exactly right, because this has been contrived by the corporate media.
[01:41:16.275 --> 01:41:23.918]  They tried it with, you know, calling him a racist country club elitist just because he had his victory celebration there.
[01:41:23.918 --> 01:41:27.279]  That didn't work, so now they're going at it from this angle.
[01:41:27.279 --> 01:41:30.981]  And the corporate media has lost most of its credibility.
[01:41:31.687 --> 01:41:40.155]  So, these kind of smears don't work anymore, which is what they need to understand, which is why they're flip-flopping from one to another.
[01:41:40.155 --> 01:41:48.443]  And now, it seems to have moved on to this Rand Paul went on the Alex Jones Show a few times, and that supposedly makes him evil now.
[01:41:48.443 --> 01:41:55.070]  So, it looks like they're gonna try and run with that one next, but again, it's like, it's like flogging a dead horse.
[01:41:55.538 --> 01:42:12.505]  Rand Paul and his father Ron Paul have repeatedly said that a significant amount of their supporters are Alex Jones listeners, or at least they're familiar and embrace the same ideals and the information that Alex talks about every day on his show.
[01:42:12.505 --> 01:42:25.110]  So to try and, you know, undermine Rand Paul's support base by associating him with Alex Jones and the information that Alex Jones puts out when most of Rand Paul's supporters
[01:42:25.831 --> 01:42:27.977]  I have similar beliefs.
[01:42:27.977 --> 01:42:30.484]  It's just completely asinine and it won't work.
[01:42:30.484 --> 01:42:31.847]  It'll fall flat on its face.
[01:42:33.001 --> 01:42:35.883]  Well, absolutely, but that won't stop them from trying.
[01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:41.585]  I want to shift gears and talk a little bit about what's happening with Google.
[01:42:41.585 --> 01:42:43.346]  This one is out of The Guardian.
[01:42:43.346 --> 01:42:48.349]  Google keeps Street View UK Wi-Fi data as privacy group seeks legal action.
[01:42:48.349 --> 01:43:01.516]  If you were listening on Wednesday, I stood in for Alex for about an hour and went over the fact that Google, over the past several years, they're not saying how many years, were using their Street View camera devices, their little cars there,
[01:43:02.096 --> 01:43:05.158]  To take all the wireless data and store it.
[01:43:05.158 --> 01:43:09.540]  Oh, they were taking open source information and storing it in their data mining operation.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.481]  But then they said it was an accident, Paul.
[01:43:11.481 --> 01:43:12.982]  It was all accidental.
[01:43:12.982 --> 01:43:19.205]  But anybody who knows anything about computers knows to take information and to store it requires hardware and software.
[01:43:19.205 --> 01:43:22.767]  And I've had people email me and say, those are just cameras on the top of the car.
[01:43:22.767 --> 01:43:26.169]  Yeah, they're cameras, but they're also admitting to data mining.
[01:43:26.289 --> 01:43:29.971]  So this article right here, a Google Street View car on Coronation Street.
[01:43:29.971 --> 01:43:33.733]  It's not clear whether the Rover's return has Wi-Fi.
[01:43:33.733 --> 01:43:34.514]  Of course it does.
[01:43:34.514 --> 01:43:45.620]  Google is to retain data captured from the UK wireless home networks for carrying out its Street View mapping until it receives more specific instructions from the UK Information Commissioner, it said today.
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:49.822]  But if you were listening on Wednesday, they said they told them to destroy the data immediately.
[01:43:49.822 --> 01:43:51.783]  They're not going to do so.
[01:43:51.783 --> 01:43:53.324]  Regulation of investigative
[01:43:53.644 --> 01:44:08.401]  Torrey Powers Act RIPA for unlawful interception of users data and the group may try to go to the police to investigate the situation it absolutely should be a criminal investigation into why Google is taking everybody's information without their permission
[01:44:08.681 --> 01:44:22.785]  Google is already facing criminal investigations in Germany over its capture of the data from open Wi-Fi networks and faces further investigations from a number of European countries for possible breaches of data protection laws and possibly computer hacking.
[01:44:22.785 --> 01:44:30.288]  It has deleted, it says it has deleted, the data that was collected in Ireland, Denmark and Austria according to those countries wishes.
[01:44:30.288 --> 01:44:34.889]  That means there cannot be any threat of prosecution to those countries as any evidence for the court case.
[01:44:35.449 --> 01:44:58.853]  Unavailable so they saw that they might be prosecuted in those countries and apparently dumped the data in a statement released on Friday The company said following requests from the Irish Danish and Austrian data protection authorities We can confirm that we have deleted payload data identified as coming in from those countries They're also saying that they got rid of their Belgium France Italy Spain Germany Switzerland and Czech Republic information notice the United States is
[01:44:58.993 --> 01:44:59.473]  Isn't there?
[01:44:59.473 --> 01:45:13.101]  And if you read the headline yesterday, it was the CEO, Eric Schmidt, who we have in Visible Empire, talking about a new world order saying no harm, no foul, as if this is a basketball game.
[01:45:13.101 --> 01:45:14.701]  No, it's a data mining issue.
[01:45:14.701 --> 01:45:15.562]  And I'm going to close it with this.
[01:45:15.562 --> 01:45:22.706]  German prosecutors have requested access to one of the hard drives used in the data gathering, though Google has so far refused.
[01:45:22.706 --> 01:45:25.547]  See, they won't tell you what they're taking.
[01:45:25.547 --> 01:45:26.788]  Paul, what's your view on this?
[01:45:26.788 --> 01:45:28.729]  And why isn't this a huge story in the United
[01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:53.698]  It isn't a huge story because Google's reputation as a respecter of privacy, which of course is a misnomer, they worked with, it was announced in 2008, more than two years ago, that Google was working with the CIA to gather intelligence inside the US.
[01:45:53.698 --> 01:45:56.839]  You know that Google was founded with the aid of CIA money.
[01:45:57.495 --> 01:46:04.620]  So of course Google is a mass depository of data about Americans and about anyone that uses it.
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:09.864]  And the government's gonna use that data and the government's working with Google to use that data.
[01:46:09.864 --> 01:46:11.225]  It's like Facebook.
[01:46:11.225 --> 01:46:14.328]  Again, it's just a mass government depository.
[01:46:14.328 --> 01:46:21.934]  Anyone who still has a Facebook profile that they keep any personal information whatsoever on is out of their mind.
[01:46:21.934 --> 01:46:25.016]  You had the instant messages come out last week.
[01:46:25.894 --> 01:46:49.267]  Um, from the founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, where he's talking to someone about people on Facebook, people using Facebook, and he said, quote, I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS, and this is just after it started, and his friend responds, what, how did you manage that one?
[01:46:49.267 --> 01:46:51.328]  Zuckerberg, people just submitted it.
[01:46:51.328 --> 01:46:52.289]  I don't know why.
[01:46:52.289 --> 01:46:53.609]  They trust me.
[01:46:53.609 --> 01:46:54.490]  Dumb effers.
[01:46:55.359 --> 01:47:07.490]  So that's the CEO and founder of Facebook laughing about and swearing at people who submit their personal information, which he now has control of.
[01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:18.400]  And now we learn that, again, like Google, Facebook is openly working with the CIA with all this information about people's personal lives right at their fingertips.
[01:47:19.542 --> 01:47:38.444]  Exactly it's going to create a system where they can really database and profile people on another level and then sell those databases and profiles to private companies so you won't even have to go on Facebook to see the little ad on the side they're going to match your IP address with your Facebook account and you'll literally go to any search engine or
[01:47:38.564 --> 01:47:38.704]  We're
[01:47:55.279 --> 01:47:57.600]  Well, exactly, and it's not just a privacy issue.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.580]  It's a harassment issue because
[01:48:22.091 --> 01:48:38.484]  As we're moving towards this minority report style world where advertising and promotional media becomes more and more invasive, you know, now they have magazines that play videos when you're opening and reading just a standard magazine.
[01:48:38.484 --> 01:48:43.047]  They have systems whereby if you drive by certain
[01:48:44.645 --> 01:48:56.435]  Places on the highway where they have transmitters, they can sense what radio station you're listening to and display ads based on those tastes in music or preferences.
[01:48:56.435 --> 01:49:06.664]  When you list the bands that you like on your Facebook page, targeted advertising based on that information that you submitted is then directed towards you.
[01:49:06.664 --> 01:49:11.729]  So it's not just a question of your personal life being exposed and being known.
[01:49:12.421 --> 01:49:23.549]  It's the harassment that will follow as a result of this minority report style invasive advertising, which will all run off the information that you gave them in the first place.
[01:49:23.549 --> 01:49:24.849]  And it's not just that.
[01:49:24.849 --> 01:49:34.276]  Years ago, the FBI announced they would be trolling MySpace and Facebook with fake profiles to basically entrap people.
[01:49:34.276 --> 01:49:39.780]  For instance, I remember the story last year at a high school prom party in New Jersey.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:40.360]  They had some
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:41.481]  Well, exactly.
[01:49:41.481 --> 01:49:44.682]  I mean, it's no surprise because the entire internet was an NSA database.
[01:49:44.682 --> 01:49:45.703]  That's how it began.
[01:49:45.703 --> 01:49:47.104]  And it hasn't really changed from that in 2010.
[01:50:06.874 --> 01:50:12.356]  So, people need to be more aware than ever about personal information.
[01:50:12.356 --> 01:50:24.961]  I still find it amazing that people will post photographs of their own children and, you know, photographs of their own personal life completely openly on the internet for everyone in the world to view.
[01:50:24.961 --> 01:50:32.824]  I mean, if they value their privacy so little, then, you know, they shouldn't be surprised when all these scandals emerged about
[01:50:33.450 --> 01:50:38.235]  How their data was being sold by the government and between different corporations.
[01:50:38.235 --> 01:50:40.817]  So it's a two-way street.
[01:50:40.817 --> 01:50:42.038]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:42.038 --> 01:50:43.380]  I am Jason Burmess sitting in.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:48.705]  We're going to come back with one final segment with Paul Joseph Watson of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:48.705 --> 01:50:52.448]  We're streaming live over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:01.195 --> 01:51:02.496]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.496 --> 01:51:08.102]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.102 --> 01:51:13.127]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.127 --> 01:51:18.692]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.692 --> 01:51:23.917]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.917 --> 01:51:25.799]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.212 --> 01:51:31.015]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.015 --> 01:51:32.136]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.136 --> 01:51:35.198]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.198 --> 01:51:38.840]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:51:55.305 --> 01:51:57.866]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.866 --> 01:52:01.267]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.267 --> 01:52:04.628]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.628 --> 01:52:08.549]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.549 --> 01:52:12.250]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:12.250 --> 01:52:18.572]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine
[01:52:21.263 --> 01:52:27.432]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[01:53:02.017 --> 01:53:02.757]  The problem.
[01:53:02.757 --> 01:53:05.339]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:53:05.339 --> 01:53:08.040]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.741]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:53:10.741 --> 01:53:12.302]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:53:13.226 --> 01:53:22.229]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from Kero Stove.

[01:53:56.885 --> 01:53:59.967]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[01:54:08.467 --> 01:54:24.381]  Paul, before you go, I want to get your take on Calderon earlier in the week getting in front of the White House lawn with President Barack Obama denouncing the Arizona law.
[01:54:24.381 --> 01:54:28.565]  President Barack Obama getting up there saying, well I think the law has the potential
[01:54:29.165 --> 01:54:41.111]  Yeah, I wrote an article this morning about Congressman McClintock's response to what Calderon said and how he was cheered on by the Democrats in Congress.
[01:54:59.378 --> 01:55:14.861]  And he basically quoted President Teddy Roosevelt from about a hundred years ago on how immigration was originally defined and how immigrants should emigrate into the United States and how it should be done.
[01:55:14.861 --> 01:55:26.763]  And the full quotes in the article, and Teddy Roosevelt basically said, we only have room for one flag, the American flag, we only have room for one language, and that is the English language.
[01:55:27.395 --> 01:55:50.086]  And yet, we were forced to witness a few days ago, Michelle Obama, the First Lady, who visited a school in New Hampshire, dancing around with these children, a Mexican flag inside a US school, while the children told her about how their parents were illegal aliens.
[01:55:50.086 --> 01:55:53.888]  So I find it absolutely abhorrent that you've got these
[01:55:55.453 --> 01:56:03.138]  radical racial liberation theology people who are hyped up with this La Raza coming into the U.S.
[01:56:03.138 --> 01:56:07.861]  illegally flying the Mexican flag tearing down the U.S.
[01:56:07.861 --> 01:56:21.751]  flag and now even you have students on campuses getting kicked off wearing t-shirts with the American flag on and it's completely 180 to what the original scope and purpose of what
[01:56:22.287 --> 01:56:22.527]  I don't
[01:56:37.999 --> 01:56:55.717]  Um, so an unelected dictator lecturing the United States Congress and the American people about their own domestic laws and then going further and attacking the Second Amendment and calling for the assault weapons ban to be reinstated.
[01:56:55.717 --> 01:56:59.982]  Um, and McClintock called it an outrage and that's exactly what it is.
[01:57:01.448 --> 01:57:16.012]  Absolutely an outrage, and to go back to what Michelle Obama did, they are playing on the dumbed-down masses' heartstrings by showing you this cute little girl and, my mommy says we don't have papers, does that mean I'm going to get taken away?
[01:57:16.012 --> 01:57:22.973]  And then Michelle Obama says, don't worry sweetie, that's one of the things we have to fix and we're going to fix that, don't worry.
[01:57:22.973 --> 01:57:28.755]  I was blown away and you're seeing this all over the news.
[01:57:28.755 --> 01:57:28.995]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.488 --> 01:57:32.930]  But then look at what happens if you don't have papers in Mexico.
[01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:34.491]  You know, you get thrown in jail.
[01:57:34.491 --> 01:57:40.035]  I mean, just look at the picture at the top of my article today.
[01:57:40.035 --> 01:57:55.624]  People who visit Mexico say, and we quoted another one who was a resident of Arizona in the article yesterday, that basically you can't travel for 20 minutes without getting stopped and searched by goons in military outfits with guns.
[01:57:55.624 --> 01:57:56.905]  So that's how
[01:57:57.889 --> 01:58:10.415]  Mexico treats visitors to Mexico, whereas, you know, you just walk straight across the border into the United States and you can get a welfare, you can get a job, you can get all these civil rights.
[01:58:10.415 --> 01:58:20.340]  And just for enforcing an immigration policy that's already on the books in Arizona, suddenly, you know, everybody's in outrage about it.
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:23.161]  And again, it's a contrived media spectacle.
[01:58:23.161 --> 01:58:24.222]  The key thing about it is
[01:58:25.169 --> 01:58:43.301]  According to all the polls, and I linked to one in the article yesterday, the majority of Hispanic, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans support enforcing the current immigration laws that are on the books.
[01:58:43.301 --> 01:58:45.782]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.782 --> 01:58:48.104]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.294 --> 01:58:54.297]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.297 --> 01:58:59.624]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.624 --> 01:59:01.686]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.686 --> 01:59:06.692]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.692 --> 01:59:07.873]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.873 --> 01:59:08.594]  When do you want it?
[01:59:08.974 --> 01:59:10.855]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.855 --> 01:59:11.935]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.935 --> 01:59:14.136]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.136 --> 01:59:15.477]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.477 --> 01:59:16.997]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:16.997 --> 01:59:22.279]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:22.279 --> 01:59:25.861]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:25.861 --> 01:59:29.322]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.682 --> 01:59:30.882]  How much will you need?
[01:59:30.882 --> 01:59:31.803]  We don't know.
[01:59:31.803 --> 01:59:32.903]  How much do you want?
[01:59:32.903 --> 01:59:33.823]  All you can get.
[01:59:33.823 --> 01:59:34.924]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.924 --> 01:59:37.985]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:37.985 --> 01:59:38.505]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[01:59:40.165 --> 01:59:41.165]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:41.165 --> 01:59:42.346]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:42.346 --> 01:59:44.206]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.475 --> 02:00:10.317]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[02:00:10.317 --> 02:00:11.898]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.898 --> 02:00:13.458]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.458 --> 02:00:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:21.701]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.302 --> 02:00:23.882]  We're back!
[02:00:23.882 --> 02:00:24.643]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:24.643 --> 02:00:30.845]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting, and Paul Joseph Watson just left us, and we've got Bob Chapman on the line.
[02:00:30.845 --> 02:00:38.288]  We're going to be getting into the economy and so much more with Mr. Chapman, but first I want to thank a couple of the sponsors that have made this radio broadcast possible.
[02:00:38.908 --> 02:00:42.691]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:00:42.691 --> 02:00:47.874]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water go visit purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:00:47.874 --> 02:00:50.716]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.

[02:00:54.679 --> 02:00:57.201]  With a whole house fluoride system.
[02:00:57.201 --> 02:01:01.644]  So go check them out right now at purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:01:01.644 --> 02:01:09.590]  And of course our oldest sponsor out there survivalseedbank.com 877-327-0365.
[02:01:09.590 --> 02:01:17.677]  In a real crisis having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[02:01:17.677 --> 02:01:20.639]  You want a small victory against the new world order?
[02:01:20.959 --> 02:01:22.040]  Grow that victory garden!
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:24.762]  Go to survivalseedbank.com or check them out at 1-877-327-0365.
[02:01:24.762 --> 02:01:35.070]  Alright, we're joined by Bob Chapman and I have a couple of questions for Bob myself.
[02:01:35.070 --> 02:01:37.952]  I was only able to scan over the news for about an hour today.
[02:01:37.952 --> 02:01:41.034]  I was out of town last night.
[02:01:41.034 --> 02:01:44.316]  So there are a couple headlines that I'd like to go over including
[02:01:45.277 --> 02:01:54.864]  This one right here, FDIC problem banks at 775, a total of 775 banks or one-tenth of all U.S.
[02:01:54.864 --> 02:02:05.352]  banks were on the FDIC's list of problem institutions in the first quarter as bad loans in the commercial real estate market weighed on bank balance sheets.
[02:02:05.352 --> 02:02:13.739]  And it's probably much worse than that, but of course, the one-tenth, the 10% they're talking about are the smaller banks that will be consolidated
[02:02:14.199 --> 02:02:18.883]  Consolidated into the big boys, what's your take, Bob?
[02:02:18.883 --> 02:02:20.404]  Well, first of all, the figure's over 2,000.
[02:02:20.404 --> 02:02:22.926]  The real figure.
[02:02:22.926 --> 02:02:28.230]  I know that because I have somebody who attends those meetings who leaks the stuff to me.
[02:02:28.230 --> 02:02:36.636]  Second of all, there's 2,000 banks that the Comptroller of the Currencies Office has their employees in, and they're actually running the banks.
[02:02:36.636 --> 02:02:39.438]  And eventually, all of those banks will probably go under.
[02:02:40.606 --> 02:02:47.499]  Uh, 72 banks officially have gone under this year, but they don't count how many branches I had, and many of them have 50 or 300 or whatever it is, branches.
[02:02:50.054 --> 02:02:54.656]  So it's been fairly extensive as far as job loss is concerned.
[02:02:54.656 --> 02:03:00.919]  And I think that there's a good possibility that two to three hundred will go under this year.
[02:03:00.919 --> 02:03:08.443]  It's hard to tell which way they're going to go on it as far as whether they're going to have some merges.
[02:03:08.443 --> 02:03:11.865]  And very often they don't even announce some merges.
[02:03:13.217 --> 02:03:21.919]  The FDIC probably has about 90 billion dollars, including the three years that the banks have paid ahead on their dues.
[02:03:21.919 --> 02:03:29.720]  That probably will last them until the end of the year, maybe into the first quarter of next year, and they're going to be broke again.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:33.020]  And so it's not very good, but those are the numbers on that.
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:34.561]  So what are we going to see?
[02:03:34.561 --> 02:03:36.921]  More revolving bailouts once this comes out?
[02:03:36.921 --> 02:03:38.361]  Once we have a couple banks go under?
[02:03:38.361 --> 02:03:39.742]  Some more consolidation of power?
[02:03:39.742 --> 02:03:41.842]  They'll say the FDIC is broke and needs more help?
[02:03:44.059 --> 02:04:09.108]  Well, under the bill that was just passed in the Senate, which must go to conference in the House, the Federal Reserve, instead of being audited like they should be, is going to have one audit, and it's going to be restricted to just one certain area, and that's it.
[02:04:09.108 --> 02:04:12.029]  And so what they're doing is throwing the public a bone.
[02:04:13.757 --> 02:04:34.006]  It was in that bill, the FDIC is supposed to take over the control of the currency, the FDIC, the SEC, the CFTC, and a new group called Consumer something or other to protect consumers.
[02:04:34.006 --> 02:04:35.207]  And then they also have
[02:04:36.094 --> 02:04:38.899]  Another group that they've formed under that.
[02:04:38.899 --> 02:04:39.820]  Hold right there, Bob.
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:41.382]  We're gonna come back to you on the other side.
[02:04:41.382 --> 02:04:42.364]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:42.364 --> 02:04:50.656]  We're gonna go over this new Senate bill that passed 59 to 39 just yesterday with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:05:00.816 --> 02:05:04.918]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[02:05:54.267 --> 02:05:57.150]  H-O-M-E G-A-I-N.com.
[02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:57.891]  Check them out today.
[02:06:00.273 --> 02:06:02.675]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:06:02.675 --> 02:06:04.997]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:06:04.997 --> 02:06:08.200]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:13.304]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:06:13.304 --> 02:06:17.508]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:06:17.808 --> 02:06:20.152]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:06:20.152 --> 02:06:23.056]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:06:23.056 --> 02:06:25.960]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:33.572]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:06:33.894 --> 02:06:39.277]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:06:39.277 --> 02:06:42.138]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:06:42.138 --> 02:06:45.820]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:46.901]  And I got news for you.
[02:06:46.901 --> 02:06:48.242]  You're everyone else.
[02:06:48.242 --> 02:06:49.742]  Invisible Empire.

[02:07:24.277 --> 02:07:30.802]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:07:52.812 --> 02:07:53.493]  Thank you!
[02:08:02.563 --> 02:08:09.217]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.217 --> 02:08:12.183]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.992 --> 02:08:18.973]  We are back!
[02:08:18.973 --> 02:08:19.814]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:19.814 --> 02:08:22.796]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting and we've got Bob Chapman on the line.
[02:08:22.796 --> 02:08:23.817]  I want to read some of this article.
[02:08:23.817 --> 02:08:26.540]  Senate passes financial reform bill.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:29.883]  Vote represents a major policy victory for President Obama.
[02:08:29.883 --> 02:08:33.326]  And I was out of town last night so I was kind of late coming in.
[02:08:33.326 --> 02:08:33.626]  I didn't get
[02:08:33.626 --> 02:08:34.086]  Let's get to it.
[02:09:03.593 --> 02:09:10.377]  It makes a monopoly out of the Federal Reserve, a private corporation.
[02:09:10.377 --> 02:09:28.346]  And it will include, as I pointed out earlier, really escape from audit for all intents and purposes, and the absorption of the control over the currency, and the FDIC, the SEC, the CFTC,
[02:09:29.654 --> 02:09:38.536]  And this new Consumer Protection Agency and a stability board that they'll have or something to that effect.
[02:09:38.536 --> 02:09:52.559]  And also they want reporting on derivatives that are trading over the counter market to be transparent like other kinds of derivatives that are now traded on exchanges and have been since 1972.
[02:09:55.916 --> 02:09:58.398]  Wall Street doesn't like that.
[02:09:58.398 --> 02:10:14.070]  They didn't say anything and there was no discussion about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their problems and a possible takeover or something to be done with them.
[02:10:14.070 --> 02:10:20.175]  They discussed Glass-Steagall reintroduction and that went by the wayside.
[02:10:20.984 --> 02:10:22.805]  Now let's talk about Glass-Steagall for a moment.
[02:10:22.805 --> 02:10:28.408]  What would have happened if they had reintroduced Glass-Steagall, in your opinion?
[02:10:28.408 --> 02:10:31.911]  I think it would have solved a great many of the problems that we have today.
[02:10:31.911 --> 02:10:41.416]  It was probably one of the most brilliant pieces of legislation at the right time, 1931, and it stood up all those years.
[02:10:41.416 --> 02:10:48.941]  And what it is, essentially, is a wall between the banks and the brokerage firms and the insurance companies.
[02:10:49.758 --> 02:10:50.038]  I don't know.
[02:11:08.892 --> 02:11:10.493]  And they wanted to do that again.
[02:11:10.493 --> 02:11:13.854]  They also wanted to address the too-big-to-fail.
[02:11:13.854 --> 02:11:16.334]  They didn't do anything about that.
[02:11:16.334 --> 02:11:21.475]  And the people in the House are very disturbed that H.R.
[02:11:21.475 --> 02:11:31.618]  1207, which was the House bill, 326 members voted for it, that was decimated in the Senate committee.
[02:11:31.618 --> 02:11:35.459]  And so this bill is not going to easily go through the House.
[02:11:36.218 --> 02:11:39.500]  Whether there's a lot of Democrats in there or not.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:44.122]  And because some of the Democrats are fiscally conservative.
[02:11:44.122 --> 02:11:49.785]  And so we haven't heard the end of the show, but I want to add something here that you didn't expect.
[02:11:49.785 --> 02:11:55.007]  And that is, on May 6th, we saw the market drop a thousand points.
[02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:59.229]  And I explained in the forecaster why that happened.
[02:11:59.229 --> 02:12:01.370]  And it was these black box traders
[02:12:03.311 --> 02:12:10.175]  Using the algorithms and hedge funds that deliberately knocked the market down.
[02:12:10.175 --> 02:12:16.558]  And they were trying to tell the Senate, if you don't do what we want you to do, we're going to destroy this market.
[02:12:16.558 --> 02:12:32.166]  Now, they've done it again in the last five or six days because they wanted to, again, get the Senate to do as little as possible about the things that the Senate was supposed to do and what Wall Street and banking didn't want.
[02:12:33.090 --> 02:12:34.691]  Now it's going to the House.
[02:12:34.691 --> 02:12:38.372]  And that's why you see what you're seeing going on.
[02:12:38.372 --> 02:12:40.233]  They're rigging the market.
[02:12:40.233 --> 02:12:41.273]  Let me stop you right there.
[02:12:41.273 --> 02:12:44.414]  We've got Alex Jones on the line to throw in his two cents.
[02:12:44.414 --> 02:12:46.155]  Alex?
[02:12:46.155 --> 02:12:49.716]  Yeah, how could I miss a day with Bob Chapman?
[02:12:49.716 --> 02:12:51.097]  And I was just listening to the show.
[02:12:51.097 --> 02:12:51.577]  Absolutely.
[02:12:51.577 --> 02:12:53.618]  They've got to pass this in the House.
[02:12:53.618 --> 02:12:55.978]  This isn't just Alex Jones or Bob Chapman telling you this.
[02:12:55.978 --> 02:12:57.919]  This has been on the Associated Press.
[02:12:57.919 --> 02:12:59.600]  But they're reporting it like it's a good thing.
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:02.701]  In the bill, it allows the federal government
[02:13:03.772 --> 02:13:13.699]  ...to live-time track every credit card purchase, everything you're doing in your bank account, you know, before they could just randomly dial in or have the banks spy on you.
[02:13:13.699 --> 02:13:28.569]  This is now everything you do transparent to the government, and it gives all these Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan regulators that are in all the regulation positions the power to come in and take over regional banks, local banks, healthy banks.
[02:13:28.569 --> 02:13:31.211]  And that's why the head of the Texas Banking Association a month ago
[02:13:32.049 --> 02:13:37.413]  Basically, you know, wrote a big editorial saying this is a takeover of healthy banks that aren't involved in the derivatives.
[02:13:37.413 --> 02:13:39.235]  So what Bob said is absolutely right.
[02:13:39.235 --> 02:13:44.358]  This is an expansion, a monopoly of the Federal Reserve offshore power.
[02:13:44.358 --> 02:13:45.699]  This is what the bankers always do.
[02:13:45.699 --> 02:14:00.110]  They create the crisis, and then they sell something to the public that, oh, this will get the big bankers, this will... Just like 1913 takeover was passed as a supposed way to bring the bankers
[02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:06.135]  To justice when when they were the ones that were engineering it so it's problem reaction solution.
[02:14:06.135 --> 02:14:27.525]  We've got to beat this in the house It's just a giant power grab and so I want Bob to speak to that and I'm gonna let you guys go But I also want Bob to talk about what's happening in the global markets right now and what he sees with the serious chance of a financial meltdown Robini and others are saying is
[02:14:27.884 --> 02:14:31.390]  At least a 20% drop in the next month in the stock market.
[02:14:31.390 --> 02:14:35.396]  Fobbers saying a 90% chance China's going to implode, which will bring us down.
[02:14:35.396 --> 02:14:38.401]  I mean, these are crazy times to be alive.
[02:14:38.401 --> 02:14:39.563]  And, Jason, great job.
[02:14:39.563 --> 02:14:41.086]  Bob Chapman, good hearing it.
[02:14:41.086 --> 02:14:42.508]  Go ahead, and you guys take it back over.
[02:14:43.561 --> 02:14:47.286]  We had Senator Tom Harkin discussing this legislation.
[02:14:47.286 --> 02:14:54.555]  Now he voted for it, and then he said, but I wish we could have gotten the proposal to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act through.
[02:14:54.555 --> 02:14:59.120]  Is he being genuine, or is he really just playing both sides of the field, do you think, Bob?
[02:15:00.391 --> 02:15:01.512]  It's hard for me to say.
[02:15:01.512 --> 02:15:08.196]  This is a subjective answer, but knowing he's a politician, he's playing both sides.
[02:15:08.196 --> 02:15:10.798]  He did one thing and says another.
[02:15:10.798 --> 02:15:13.959]  Watch what they do, not what they say.
[02:15:13.959 --> 02:15:19.503]  But just generally speaking, I think we're on our way, and this is aside.
[02:15:20.183 --> 02:15:21.504]  No.
[02:15:21.504 --> 02:15:29.771]  With the elections that are being held, the primaries particularly, are very positive in our direction.
[02:15:29.771 --> 02:15:40.420]  And I just hope in November that people stampede to the polls and vote out every incumbent, with the exception of a handful.
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:43.183]  And if we can do that, we get a shot within the system.
[02:15:44.163 --> 02:15:48.226]  Of changing things and changing them dramatically.
[02:15:48.226 --> 02:15:49.667]  That doesn't happen.
[02:15:49.667 --> 02:15:52.289]  It's not going to be easy.
[02:15:52.289 --> 02:15:59.653]  Getting back to the financial experience that we're going through right now.
[02:15:59.653 --> 02:16:10.140]  Most people won't come out and say what I and Max Keiser in particular say because we've both been market people so to speak for many years.
[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:12.422]  And the truth about what these people are up to
[02:16:13.451 --> 02:16:24.514]  And it is amazing that the power and the pressure that Wall Street and banking are bringing upon the Senate.
[02:16:24.514 --> 02:16:27.775]  You saw they did virtually nothing.
[02:16:27.775 --> 02:16:31.176]  And they're going to try to apply the same pressure to the House.
[02:16:31.176 --> 02:16:34.197]  And they're telling these people now, you see the market?
[02:16:34.197 --> 02:16:36.278]  You want it a couple of thousand points lower?
[02:16:36.278 --> 02:16:38.198]  We'll put it there.
[02:16:38.198 --> 02:16:39.339]  If you don't, we'll do what we do.
[02:16:39.339 --> 02:16:40.039]  It's extortion.
[02:16:41.465 --> 02:16:44.307]  And you think they're just going to continue to do this again and again and again?
[02:16:44.307 --> 02:16:45.948]  I mean, where's the endgame?
[02:16:45.948 --> 02:16:47.549]  When is enough power enough?
[02:16:47.549 --> 02:16:52.672]  As Alex talked about, this is yet more consolidation of power for the Federal Reserve.
[02:16:52.672 --> 02:17:01.417]  We saw that consolidation of power over a year ago at the G20, when all of a sudden the Federal Reserve, the SEC were under the IMF and World Bank.
[02:17:01.417 --> 02:17:03.318]  I mean, how much further can they take this, Bob?
[02:17:03.318 --> 02:17:09.502]  Well, they're going to take it as far as they can because they want a one world dictatorial government.
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:12.061]  They want to enslave everybody.
[02:17:12.061 --> 02:17:14.863]  And they wanted to do this for a thousand years.
[02:17:14.863 --> 02:17:16.284]  And so they're going to keep on doing it.
[02:17:16.284 --> 02:17:29.091]  And that's why, if we can go in and take over Congress, so to speak, for the people, instead of these vested interests, then we can stop them from doing what they're doing.
[02:17:29.091 --> 02:17:32.633]  I mean, flash trading, which is front running,
[02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:53.220]  Has always been illegal and the SEC stands there and allows 17 major firms with black boxes with algorithms to beat the public to death in nanosecond trading right in the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:55.082]  It's incredible.
[02:17:55.082 --> 02:18:02.247]  Second of all, they allow naked shorting and it's illegal, but they still do it.
[02:18:02.247 --> 02:18:03.008]  And derivatives
[02:18:03.604 --> 02:18:05.685]  Or a disaster waiting to happen.
[02:18:05.685 --> 02:18:10.827]  There shouldn't be any derivatives unless they're on a listed exchange.
[02:18:10.827 --> 02:18:23.533]  There shouldn't be the ChaiX exchange, which most of you have never even heard of, which is doing these deep... I forget what they call them.
[02:18:23.533 --> 02:18:25.954]  I write about it all the time, but I can't remember.
[02:18:25.954 --> 02:18:28.855]  Deep pools, as they're called.
[02:18:28.855 --> 02:18:30.916]  And they don't report to anybody.
[02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:33.635]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:18:33.635 --> 02:18:40.494]  They're trading billions of dollars of shares every day in these dark pools, and nobody knows what they're doing.
[02:18:42.202 --> 02:18:53.793]  Well, I think that's why it's so important that we need to get ourselves into a position where we can take care of ourselves financially if the stock market completely dies, if the dollar is devalued further.
[02:18:53.793 --> 02:18:57.997]  On the other side, I want to talk about China revaluation would hurt U.S.
[02:18:57.997 --> 02:19:06.224]  World Banks, and that is the, I believe, chief economist of the World Bank actually admitting if they revalue China's currency it's going to hurt us big time.
[02:19:06.224 --> 02:19:06.885]  I want to get your take
[02:19:07.466 --> 02:19:07.746]  I think?
[02:19:27.988 --> 02:19:34.972]  segment, but it is completely incredible to me the way the media spins the passages of these bills.
[02:19:34.972 --> 02:19:37.414]  Oh, they're going after the banksters.
[02:19:37.414 --> 02:19:47.100]  We're getting hard on Wall Street when in fact all they're doing is consolidating power into a world dictatorial banker-run government.
[02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:48.261]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:48.261 --> 02:19:49.621]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[02:19:49.621 --> 02:19:51.082]  Bob Chapman on the line.
[02:19:51.082 --> 02:19:52.023]  We'll be back after this.
[02:20:01.345 --> 02:20:02.506]  Fatigue.
[02:20:02.506 --> 02:20:03.606]  Headaches.
[02:20:03.606 --> 02:20:04.947]  Allergies and asthma.
[02:20:04.947 --> 02:20:06.367]  Chronic disease.
[02:20:06.367 --> 02:20:08.228]  Is your home making you sick?
[02:20:08.228 --> 02:20:09.149]  Here's a fact.
[02:20:09.149 --> 02:20:17.132]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[02:20:17.132 --> 02:20:24.336]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.
[02:20:24.336 --> 02:20:29.138]  Our air purifiers are specialized to fit your needs, from allergy sufferers to the sleep-deprived.
[02:20:38.746 --> 02:20:39.166]  I think so.
[02:21:00.936 --> 02:21:05.899]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:05.899 --> 02:21:06.900]  What have we got?
[02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:09.342]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:09.342 --> 02:21:10.342]  A republic.
[02:21:10.342 --> 02:21:13.004]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:13.004 --> 02:21:17.287]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:17.287 --> 02:21:22.851]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:21:22.851 --> 02:21:26.493]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:26.869 --> 02:21:30.591]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:30.591 --> 02:21:31.831]  You're being warned!
[02:21:31.831 --> 02:21:32.851]  We have the facts.
[02:21:32.851 --> 02:21:34.012]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:34.012 --> 02:21:34.932]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:34.932 --> 02:21:35.813]  We have common law.
[02:21:35.813 --> 02:21:38.334]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:38.334 --> 02:21:41.275]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:21:41.275 --> 02:21:42.215]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:42.215 --> 02:21:47.177]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:47.177 --> 02:21:48.678]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:48.678 --> 02:21:49.758]  Don't Tread on Me.
[02:21:49.758 --> 02:21:50.979]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:22:04.345]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:04.345 --> 02:22:10.408]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:22:10.408 --> 02:22:11.209]  That's right.
[02:22:11.209 --> 02:22:14.050]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:22:14.050 --> 02:22:20.974]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:22:21.534 --> 02:22:29.677]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:29.677 --> 02:22:35.160]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:40.962]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:40.962 --> 02:22:45.484]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:22:45.484 --> 02:22:45.744]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:45.744 --> 02:22:47.585]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:22:50.826 --> 02:22:53.308]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.308 --> 02:22:55.030]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.030 --> 02:23:02.495]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:02.495 --> 02:23:08.080]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:13.104]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:23:13.104 --> 02:23:18.128]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:23:18.655 --> 02:23:23.879]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:23:23.879 --> 02:23:26.201]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:23:26.201 --> 02:23:31.005]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:23:31.005 --> 02:23:32.126]  And here's the best part.
[02:23:32.126 --> 02:23:35.208]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:23:35.208 --> 02:23:38.811]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:23:38.811 --> 02:23:42.014]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:23:42.014 --> 02:23:44.236]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:23:44.236 --> 02:23:45.156]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:53.022]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:23:53.022 --> 02:23:57.844]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:23:57.844 --> 02:24:01.525]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:24:01.525 --> 02:24:04.287]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:24:04.287 --> 02:24:07.088]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:10.201]  We are back live.
[02:24:10.201 --> 02:24:11.061]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:11.061 --> 02:24:12.342]  I am Jason Verma sitting in.
[02:24:12.342 --> 02:24:16.004]  We've got Bob Chapman on the line.
[02:24:16.004 --> 02:24:19.826]  And before I get into China revaluation would hurt U.S.
[02:24:19.826 --> 02:24:28.431]  World Bank's Lin, that's the chief economist for the World Bank, actually admitting if they revalue China's currency it is going to hurt us here at home.
[02:24:28.431 --> 02:24:34.314]  I want to talk about solutions and how people can really protect themselves from this very faltering
[02:24:35.394 --> 02:24:44.376]  Some of the other headlines out there are Dow dips below 10,000 points today, and I'm sorry, it's stocks wobble after Dow dips below 10,000.
[02:24:44.376 --> 02:24:50.798]  Europe's debt woes raise concerns that global recovery could still be far away.
[02:24:50.798 --> 02:25:00.120]  And remember, we were already supposed to have this global recovery, and oh, the recession is over, but now it's a double-dip recession, and we dare not talk depression.
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:01.640]  Bob, how can people protect themselves?
[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:08.782]  Well, I think the most important thing is your job.
[02:25:08.782 --> 02:25:18.586]  And most people in the families today that are employed have the wife and the husband working, and you should diligently try your best to keep your job.
[02:25:18.586 --> 02:25:27.470]  And in the meantime, you should see to having freeze-dried and dehydrated food, because if you lose your job, at least you can eat.
[02:25:27.470 --> 02:25:30.411]  And if there's emergencies, you'll have them on hand.
[02:25:30.411 --> 02:25:32.852]  A water filter, if eventually we have
[02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:34.431]  I don't know.
[02:25:57.995 --> 02:26:04.000]  Out of the commodity market, because most people don't, really shouldn't be there unless they're professionals.
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:10.206]  Because 95% of the people who go into the foreign exchange market and the commodity market lose money.
[02:26:10.206 --> 02:26:22.057]  And you should only have in the bank three years supply of operating funds, three months supply of operating funds for a business, six months.
[02:26:22.057 --> 02:26:23.238]  You should have no CDs.
[02:26:24.643 --> 02:26:27.904]  You should have no cash value life insurance policies.
[02:26:27.904 --> 02:26:33.325]  You should have term policies and you should not have annuities.
[02:26:33.325 --> 02:26:35.966]  They're all invested in the market and in bonds.
[02:26:35.966 --> 02:26:38.867]  Interest rates are definitely going to go up sooner or later.
[02:26:38.867 --> 02:26:40.927]  So the value of bonds will go down.
[02:26:40.927 --> 02:26:46.869]  So it cancels out all of those kinds of investments in this kind of an atmosphere.
[02:26:46.869 --> 02:26:52.210]  The only place to go to is gold and silver related assets and that's really the
[02:26:53.010 --> 02:26:53.571]  Absolutely.
[02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:58.434]  Why don't you tell people about some of the great deals over at Midas Resources right now?
[02:26:58.434 --> 02:27:04.779]  Well, Midas has been offering off and on a special where if you purchase one French or Swiss franc, usually the coin,
[02:27:21.705 --> 02:27:28.207]  The last price I think I got was $256.62, something like that.
[02:27:28.207 --> 02:27:36.930]  And if you buy that coin, you get a free one-year subscription to the International Forecaster, either by email or surface mail.
[02:27:38.314 --> 02:27:40.915]  And it's the best deal I've ever heard of.
[02:27:40.915 --> 02:27:45.197]  Ted pays me for the publication.
[02:27:45.197 --> 02:27:48.799]  And so this is a real deal.
[02:27:48.799 --> 02:27:51.460]  And a lot of people are taking advantage of it.
[02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:56.983]  And I think if you don't, I think you're sure changing yourself.
[02:27:56.983 --> 02:28:01.125]  This publication tells you everything that you need to know every week.
[02:28:02.745 --> 02:28:05.586]  Well, not quite everything.
[02:28:05.586 --> 02:28:07.988]  Alex tells you the rest.
[02:28:07.988 --> 02:28:11.870]  But anyway, it's a great offering and you should take advantage of it.
[02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:14.231]  Do you have a phone number there for them?
[02:28:18.473 --> 02:28:19.994]  They haven't, even though the markets have come down.
[02:28:41.562 --> 02:28:50.208]  I'm telling my subscribers the correction, I think, is almost over in the gold and silver area, because I'm seeing short coverings starting yesterday.
[02:28:50.208 --> 02:28:51.949]  I'm seeing more of it today.
[02:28:51.949 --> 02:28:58.433]  My gold's down about $11 right now, and the gold stocks are either even or up a little or down a little.
[02:28:58.433 --> 02:29:04.977]  And that's an indication you've got, on a short term and intermediate term, probably a sold-out market.
[02:29:04.977 --> 02:29:06.458]  But that market was attacked.
[02:29:07.262 --> 02:29:09.444]  In the same way the other markets were.
[02:29:09.444 --> 02:29:13.067]  I mean, they couldn't have gold going up while they had the market going down.
[02:29:13.067 --> 02:29:14.969]  So they bopped it for the last few days.
[02:29:14.969 --> 02:29:21.475]  Another thing is the long gold options expire on Tuesday.
[02:29:21.475 --> 02:29:29.422]  And the writers of those options, the commercials, which are banks, they don't want them, the options to expire in the money.
[02:29:29.422 --> 02:29:31.904]  And so they're knocking the market down too.
[02:29:31.904 --> 02:29:33.266]  So it'll be over by Tuesday.
[02:29:34.255 --> 02:29:35.516]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:35.516 --> 02:29:37.397]  I am Jason Burmess sitting in.
[02:29:37.397 --> 02:29:39.618]  We're sitting with Bob Chapman.
[02:29:39.618 --> 02:29:43.861]  Go check out Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:29:43.861 --> 02:29:51.506]  We'll be back after this.
[02:29:51.506 --> 02:29:52.907]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.907 --> 02:29:55.428]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.428 --> 02:29:58.110]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.765 --> 02:30:05.749]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:05.749 --> 02:30:06.729]  What have we got?
[02:30:06.729 --> 02:30:09.191]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:09.191 --> 02:30:10.192]  A republic.
[02:30:10.192 --> 02:30:12.834]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:12.834 --> 02:30:15.116]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:30:15.116 --> 02:30:17.137]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:17.137 --> 02:30:18.798]  So they think they own our land?
[02:30:18.798 --> 02:30:20.119]  They think they own our water?
[02:30:20.119 --> 02:30:20.740]  Children?
[02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:21.861]  Our education?
[02:30:21.861 --> 02:30:22.681]  Our money?
[02:30:22.681 --> 02:30:26.344]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:26.704 --> 02:30:31.671]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:30:31.671 --> 02:30:32.692]  We have the facts.
[02:30:32.692 --> 02:30:33.874]  We have the Constitution.
[02:30:33.874 --> 02:30:34.775]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:34.775 --> 02:30:35.656]  We have common law.
[02:30:35.656 --> 02:30:38.180]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:41.965]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:30:42.045 --> 02:30:47.009]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:30:47.009 --> 02:30:48.510]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:49.590]  Don't tread on me.
[02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:56.015]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:31:00.663 --> 02:31:01.964]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:01.964 --> 02:31:07.550]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:12.575]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.575 --> 02:31:17.601]  It's true, seeds did not perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:31:18.141 --> 02:31:23.365]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:31:23.365 --> 02:31:25.666]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:31:25.666 --> 02:31:30.469]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:31.590]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:34.672]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:31:34.672 --> 02:31:38.295]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.295 --> 02:31:41.477]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:31:41.477 --> 02:31:43.698]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:31:43.698 --> 02:31:44.619]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:48.262 --> 02:31:51.227]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:51.227 --> 02:31:57.338]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:57.338 --> 02:31:59.722]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:00.970 --> 02:32:03.974]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:03.974 --> 02:32:09.321]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:09.321 --> 02:32:11.364]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:11.364 --> 02:32:16.370]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:17.552]  How much do you want?
[02:32:17.552 --> 02:32:18.293]  When do you want it?
[02:32:18.653 --> 02:32:20.535]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:32:20.535 --> 02:32:21.616]  When will you need it?
[02:32:21.616 --> 02:32:23.819]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:32:23.819 --> 02:32:25.160]  Will there be any food?
[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:26.682]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:32:26.682 --> 02:32:31.947]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:32:31.947 --> 02:32:35.551]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:32:35.551 --> 02:32:39.015]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:39.355 --> 02:32:40.576]  How much will you need?
[02:32:40.576 --> 02:32:41.478]  We don't know.
[02:32:41.478 --> 02:32:42.579]  How much do you want?
[02:32:42.579 --> 02:32:43.520]  All you can get.
[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:44.601]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:44.601 --> 02:32:47.665]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:47.665 --> 02:32:49.867]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:49.867 --> 02:32:50.868]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:11.508 --> 02:33:13.610]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.610 --> 02:33:14.451]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[02:33:14.451 --> 02:33:19.195]  We're talking to Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:33:19.195 --> 02:33:22.919]  And we're going to take your calls on the topic of the economy.
[02:33:22.919 --> 02:33:27.022]  No chupacabras, no spacemen, no Johnny Nonsense.
[02:33:27.022 --> 02:33:28.344]  Let's keep it to topic.
[02:33:28.344 --> 02:33:33.648]  But before that, I want to get your take on the Chief Economist for the World Bank.
[02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:36.872]  Well, since the mid-1990s, the preferred method
[02:33:51.781 --> 02:33:52.161]  I think?
[02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:07.270]  We're good to go.
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:30.786]  But the point here is that the Chinese currency is way undervalued.
[02:34:30.786 --> 02:34:35.850]  And if they raise it, the exports to the United States will be more expensive.
[02:34:35.850 --> 02:34:43.417]  And that's coming at a time when the dollar is expensive, and the dollar shouldn't be trading where it's at.
[02:34:43.417 --> 02:34:48.722]  Whether the euro should be where it's at is up to debate, but the point is the dollar
[02:34:49.503 --> 02:34:53.746]  Doesn't deserve to be as strong as it is on the USDX index.
[02:34:53.746 --> 02:35:00.551]  It just went from 74 up to 85 in a four month period, which is really insanity.
[02:35:00.551 --> 02:35:16.101]  And that means that the balance of payments deficit in the United States is going to skyrocket because they're not going to be able to sell very easily in foreign countries because their currency has gone up in value.
[02:35:16.101 --> 02:35:17.462]  So you put the two of them together,
[02:35:18.172 --> 02:35:27.717]  And the United States is going to pay dearly for a revaluation or a stronger Chinese currency.
[02:35:27.717 --> 02:35:29.017]  Now, what are we talking about here?
[02:35:29.017 --> 02:35:34.180]  I mean, how much of our dollars purchasing power is going to be lost?
[02:35:34.180 --> 02:35:40.703]  Are we going to see things raised by 25 percent, 30 percent, perhaps double in price in this country?
[02:35:40.703 --> 02:35:41.663]  No.
[02:35:41.663 --> 02:35:43.404]  No, I don't think so.
[02:35:43.404 --> 02:35:44.845]  I would say 5 to 10 percent.
[02:35:46.539 --> 02:35:47.540]  So it'll be gradual.
[02:35:47.540 --> 02:35:51.043]  They'll hit us up for 5 to 10 percent right now and then maybe 5 to 10 percent.
[02:35:51.043 --> 02:35:52.824]  They really don't want to do that.
[02:35:52.824 --> 02:35:53.324]  Okay.
[02:35:53.324 --> 02:36:02.472]  Because they would rather imprison the slaves and try to make them work for the same amount of money or less and keep the market.
[02:36:02.472 --> 02:36:03.793]  That's really what they're all about.
[02:36:04.837 --> 02:36:12.243]  It's a command economy, it's a communist economy, and it's a totalitarian economy, which everybody seems to forget.
[02:36:12.243 --> 02:36:18.148]  I mean, these are the people that we used to chase all over the world and spy on and kill them.
[02:36:18.148 --> 02:36:19.529]  And we don't do that anymore.
[02:36:19.529 --> 02:36:20.910]  We play ball with them.
[02:36:20.910 --> 02:36:21.991]  I mean, what insanity.
[02:36:22.728 --> 02:36:27.110]  But anyway, China has got terrible problems.
[02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:34.153]  They have a stock market that's fallen 25% since last September, which incidentally we predicted on this program.
[02:36:34.153 --> 02:36:38.856]  And the housing market is a bubble that's about to blow up.
[02:36:38.856 --> 02:36:42.878]  And they still have 30 million unemployed.
[02:36:42.878 --> 02:36:51.742]  The only thing I can see that's good that's happened in China is people are taking their foreign exchange and they're trading it in for gold and silver.
[02:36:52.859 --> 02:36:57.743]  However, the working conditions in China are completely deplorable.
[02:36:57.743 --> 02:36:58.824]  Go check out Walmart.
[02:36:58.824 --> 02:37:00.546]  The high cost, the low price is just to see that.
[02:37:00.546 --> 02:37:06.931]  But we also have new death at iPhone factory as Chinese worker becomes eighth fatality this year.
[02:37:06.931 --> 02:37:08.593]  And they always keep this hush-hush.
[02:37:08.593 --> 02:37:11.135]  They say the people that die are often committing suicide.
[02:37:11.135 --> 02:37:18.321]  But just a month ago, we ran the story in which Microsoft's subsidiary company there, everybody was asleep.
[02:37:18.321 --> 02:37:18.742]  There was about
[02:37:19.102 --> 02:37:19.362]  I don't know.
[02:37:38.644 --> 02:37:40.686]  I just can't tell you how deplorable it is there.
[02:37:40.686 --> 02:37:44.869]  And then you have people promoting China like it's the best thing since breakfast, Bob.
[02:37:44.869 --> 02:37:51.335]  And like you said, we've been trading with them now openly for 20 plus years and really encouraging this behavior.
[02:37:51.335 --> 02:37:52.916]  That's right.
[02:37:52.916 --> 02:37:54.958]  And so what does it say about our government?
[02:37:54.958 --> 02:37:57.320]  I think we could call it corporatist fascist.
[02:37:58.559 --> 02:38:02.622]  It's just two types of socialism and they seem to be getting along fine.
[02:38:02.622 --> 02:38:14.973]  As long as it lines the pockets of the wealthy transnational conglomerates and the members of Congress and the elites who give orders to our government and most governments in the world.
[02:38:15.526 --> 02:38:25.829]  Yeah, and I briefly cover this in my latest film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, when I'm going over the Bush senior era of a quote-unquote New World Order.
[02:38:25.829 --> 02:38:35.012]  We go to a Senate hearing where Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, and others are asking James Baker about China and its role in what?
[02:38:35.012 --> 02:38:38.633]  Oh, the New World Order, because that's what George Bush was talking about.
[02:38:38.633 --> 02:38:41.794]  He was talking about China's role in the New World Order, and James Baker says, look,
[02:38:42.154 --> 02:38:47.497]  This is a nation we're going to have to work with because of their size and because of their economy.
[02:38:47.497 --> 02:38:49.438]  We just don't have a choice.
[02:38:49.438 --> 02:38:54.641]  We're going to go to some calls for Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.com right now.
[02:38:54.641 --> 02:38:55.842]  Ron, in Illinois.
[02:38:55.842 --> 02:38:57.283]  Ron, you're online.
[02:38:57.283 --> 02:38:58.344]  Hey, how's it going, guys?
[02:38:58.344 --> 02:38:58.964]  Good.
[02:38:58.964 --> 02:39:01.345]  Invisible Empire, awesome film.
[02:39:01.345 --> 02:39:03.486]  Just wanted to throw that out there for you guys.
[02:39:03.486 --> 02:39:03.907]  Thank you.
[02:39:03.907 --> 02:39:11.151]  Before I get into my question for Bob, I wanted to also say for any of you guys out there in Florida, there's a guy by the name of Bruce Ray Riggs.
[02:39:11.784 --> 02:39:13.125]  You can find him at 30 Uncle Sam.
[02:39:13.125 --> 02:39:14.226]  He's running for Senate.
[02:39:14.226 --> 02:39:15.287]  Good constitutionalist guy.
[02:39:15.287 --> 02:39:15.988]  You should check him out.
[02:39:15.988 --> 02:39:17.029]  Okay.
[02:39:17.029 --> 02:39:38.287]  Bob, my question is, do you guys, do you know of any rumors circling around about the possibility of, you know, if everybody's finding out about what the Federal Reserve's doing and wanting to end the Fed, that there could be a shift into a possible split paradigm, like something under, like a corporate treasury under the government itself, and then just shifting power into
[02:39:41.704 --> 02:39:44.465]  I haven't heard that.
[02:39:44.465 --> 02:39:54.168]  I don't think they're attempting to do that as far as I know, although it would be something that they would consider, I would think.
[02:39:54.168 --> 02:40:08.592]  One of the things that I didn't mention today is my sources in New York City tell me that a class action suit, one of many, is coming against JPMorgan Chase for rigging the silver market.
[02:40:09.435 --> 02:40:14.919]  And that ought to be quite interesting, because that's exactly what they've been doing.
[02:40:14.919 --> 02:40:18.462]  And I think the defense is going to be, we did it for the U.S.
[02:40:18.462 --> 02:40:26.789]  government under the Working Group for Financial Markets, and maybe they'll get off the hook on it, but they're going to have to stop it.
[02:40:26.789 --> 02:40:28.910]  So it's going to be a big plus for us.
[02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:38.858]  And there are an awful lot of other lawsuits against them and other big firms of different kinds related to fraud.
[02:40:39.622 --> 02:40:42.224]  Alright, let's go to our next caller, Chris in Florida.
[02:40:42.224 --> 02:40:45.246]  You're on the line with Bob Chapman.
[02:40:45.246 --> 02:40:52.252]  Oh yeah, Jason, you're talking about the iPad where they're not accepting cash anymore and I wanted to run this by Bob and have another question.
[02:40:52.871 --> 02:40:53.232]  All right.
[02:41:15.555 --> 02:41:22.196]  Now, the definition of lawful money I noticed recently was repealed back in January 2009.
[02:41:22.196 --> 02:41:32.598]  It was in Title 12, Section 152 that says that the terms lawful money and lawful money of the United States shall be construed to mean the gold and silver coin of the United States.
[02:41:32.598 --> 02:41:40.160]  And I was wondering if Bob had any news on that because it seems like it had something to do with the FDR's replacing lawful money.
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:40.320]  Bob?
[02:41:40.765 --> 02:41:51.609]  Well, I think they'd like to do that, but I don't, under the circumstances in the world right now, I don't see anybody accepting anything that doesn't have some goal backing.
[02:41:51.609 --> 02:41:54.110]  And the SDRs have no goal backing.
[02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:56.670]  They tried them in the late 60s, they didn't work.
[02:41:56.670 --> 02:42:00.632]  They've been trying them again recently, they're never going to work.
[02:42:00.632 --> 02:42:09.495]  The only thing I can see that's workable is the G20 has a meeting, they index all the currencies into a giant index,
[02:42:10.222 --> 02:42:10.662]  I don't think so.
[02:42:34.104 --> 02:42:42.247]  Before I go to Chris in Boston, Bob, I want to get your take on the fact that Apple is refusing cash for their iPads, saying it's for security reasons.
[02:42:42.247 --> 02:42:52.091]  So in order to buy one of these devices, you have to have a credit or debit card further, you know, promoting this cashless society control grid.
[02:42:52.091 --> 02:42:52.952]  Of course.
[02:42:52.952 --> 02:42:56.573]  And the idea is don't buy their products.
[02:42:56.573 --> 02:42:56.993]  I'm with you 110%.
[02:42:56.993 --> 02:42:57.914]  And I am a big fan of Apple computers.
[02:43:01.633 --> 02:43:06.918]  We've got them published with and I'll tell ya, if that's the game they want to play, we'll play it.
[02:43:06.918 --> 02:43:09.120]  Don't anybody buy them.
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:12.062]  And maybe they might get the message.
[02:43:12.062 --> 02:43:12.783]  Hey Jason, how are ya?
[02:43:18.106 --> 02:43:18.346]  What's up?
[02:43:48.046 --> 02:43:49.486]  How are you doing, Jason?
[02:43:49.486 --> 02:43:55.628]  First of all, thank you to you and Alex for all you guys do, and all your movies, everything you guys are doing are great.
[02:43:55.628 --> 02:43:56.909]  Bob, how are you doing?
[02:43:56.909 --> 02:43:57.369]  This is Chris.
[02:43:57.369 --> 02:44:01.730]  I was on the Ralph Evans show with you from Boston a couple weeks ago.
[02:44:01.730 --> 02:44:03.151]  Well, no, it's Watertown, isn't it?
[02:44:04.462 --> 02:44:09.863]  Yeah, but basically Boston, right?
[02:44:09.863 --> 02:44:11.284]  Maybe Vermont next?
[02:44:11.284 --> 02:44:12.104]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:12.104 --> 02:44:16.905]  Too bad for our Bruins, but who cares about sports anyway?
[02:44:16.905 --> 02:44:23.426]  My question, Bob, recently I had a chance to come up with some bonus money from work.
[02:44:23.426 --> 02:44:32.268]  Initially I was thinking about buying a gold coin or two, but when you think of everything going down, I mean, how much sense does it make to
[02:44:33.089 --> 02:44:34.210]  Where else you gonna go?
[02:44:41.948 --> 02:44:44.330]  Where else are you gonna go with your money that's safe?
[02:45:11.408 --> 02:45:12.949]  We're good to go.
[02:45:33.319 --> 02:45:34.621]  Oh, it might fall a little bit.
[02:45:34.621 --> 02:45:36.243]  Oh, it might be manipulated.
[02:45:36.243 --> 02:45:41.071]  The bottom line is it's a hard currency and it has intrinsic value for thousands of years.
[02:45:41.071 --> 02:45:42.032]  Appreciate the call.
[02:45:42.032 --> 02:45:42.933]  Gotta jump.
[02:45:42.933 --> 02:45:45.197]  George in Connecticut, I believe.
[02:45:45.197 --> 02:45:45.798]  George on the line.
[02:45:46.721 --> 02:45:49.944]  So, a sort of similar question, but not quite exactly the same.
[02:45:49.944 --> 02:45:53.086]  I'm wondering, I mean, you can't put everything into gold bullion.
[02:45:53.086 --> 02:46:02.114]  Is there any fund that has a combination of bullion and maybe Barrick Gold or Montgold Mines and things like that?
[02:46:02.114 --> 02:46:06.598]  But I have a back-end question about that flash trading.
[02:46:07.034 --> 02:46:10.997]  How can we hit them with some sort of RICO Act or something like this?
[02:46:10.997 --> 02:46:12.257]  Because this is criminal.
[02:46:12.257 --> 02:46:22.104]  If they finally are being hit from all sides, maybe not just in this country, but in other countries with similar laws, maybe we can stop them doing this and then stop this up in the tracks, basically.
[02:46:22.104 --> 02:46:32.950]  But going back to my original question, is there anything beyond... Well, I would say this, before Bob answers the second part as part of the original question, and maybe there's some other funds out there too, I say silver.
[02:46:34.830 --> 02:46:35.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:37.811]  Midas also has gold in IRAs.
[02:46:37.811 --> 02:46:42.712]  But silver, for instance, you know, I can get the coin that says $20 on it, that's an ounce.
[02:46:42.712 --> 02:46:45.832]  I can get the one that says $10 on it, that's half an ounce.
[02:46:45.832 --> 02:46:50.453]  That could be used in any kind of daily trading as a $10 bill, a $20 bill.
[02:46:50.453 --> 02:46:52.514]  So have a few thousand in that, Bob.
[02:46:52.514 --> 02:47:01.976]  Well, as far as the SEC and their non-execution of the rules, it's simple.
[02:47:02.506 --> 02:47:05.929]  You file a class action federal suit.
[02:47:05.929 --> 02:47:08.331]  That leaves everything out.
[02:47:08.331 --> 02:47:17.758]  And when you have hundreds of thousands of people filing this suit, or maybe a multiplicity of suits, they have to answer.
[02:47:17.758 --> 02:47:18.999]  That's number one.
[02:47:18.999 --> 02:47:21.741]  That's the way to go after them, to stop them.
[02:47:21.741 --> 02:47:25.004]  And that's what is happening to JPMorgan Chase right now.
[02:47:25.004 --> 02:47:27.846]  They're going after them, class action for rigging silver.
[02:47:28.729 --> 02:47:31.752]  As far as the fund is concerned, you don't have to do that.
[02:47:31.752 --> 02:47:34.554]  You buy gold and silver, bullion and coins.
[02:47:34.554 --> 02:47:37.257]  If you want stocks, all you have to do is email me.
[02:47:37.257 --> 02:47:38.218]  I'll tell you what to buy.
[02:47:38.218 --> 02:47:39.979]  It doesn't cost you anything.
[02:47:39.979 --> 02:47:45.284]  And I've been doing this for over 50 years, and I used to be the largest gold source stockbroker in the world.
[02:47:45.284 --> 02:47:48.127]  All right, let's go to our next caller, Don in New York.
[02:47:48.127 --> 02:47:49.849]  Don, you're on the line.
[02:47:49.849 --> 02:47:50.729]  Hey, how are you?
[02:47:50.729 --> 02:47:52.431]  Good.
[02:47:52.431 --> 02:47:53.852]  Two things, actually.
[02:47:53.852 --> 02:47:54.133]  First,
[02:47:54.997 --> 02:47:58.940]  I just wanted to make the example right off the bat before my question.
[02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:12.531]  You know, I applied for a mortgage from JPMorgan Chase and everything went through, everything was fine, and then they started getting into some very personal questions.
[02:48:12.531 --> 02:48:19.476]  They wanted to copy my divorce agreement, they asked me personal questions, and I said, there's absolutely no bearing.
[02:48:20.774 --> 02:48:28.856]  On my personal life, you know, what happened with my family or whatever, that has anything to do with the bank, you know, with a mortgage.
[02:48:28.856 --> 02:48:30.717]  And then, uh, and then I was denied.
[02:48:30.717 --> 02:48:33.438]  So, you know, I think they're crooks, but I don't know.
[02:48:33.438 --> 02:48:36.739]  Well, they're data collectors and they don't want to make the loans.
[02:48:36.739 --> 02:48:38.219]  Well, that, that's probably right.
[02:48:38.219 --> 02:48:47.022]  Uh, the question is... And the data, the data that they collect is being turned over to the United States government and they get a dossier on you just like they have everybody else.
[02:48:47.648 --> 02:49:01.831]  Yeah, they're going crazy in my area, too, with the... I actually live in a suburb of Manhattan in New Jersey, and they're going crazy with the census, too, like asking ridiculous questions, you know, even if you filled in the paperwork.
[02:49:01.831 --> 02:49:06.392]  Oh, we just want to double-check, you know, and they're going door-to-door.
[02:49:06.392 --> 02:49:13.014]  The financial question I had for you was, you know, everybody... I understand that
[02:49:13.786 --> 02:49:20.491]  Gold is probably your best bet if you can get money together and invest in something.
[02:49:20.491 --> 02:49:26.995]  With the devaluation of currency, how does that relate to people who have debt?
[02:49:26.995 --> 02:49:31.398]  If you own a mortgage and it devalues, is that a good thing?
[02:49:31.398 --> 02:49:32.179]  Is that a bad thing?
[02:49:32.179 --> 02:49:33.660]  What can possibly happen?
[02:49:34.574 --> 02:49:46.912]  Well, it's a bad thing because logically you would say if you owe $100,000 and the dollar is devalued by two-thirds and so you would only have to pay back $32,500 on a $100,000 loan.
[02:49:51.664 --> 02:49:54.165]  Well, the government is not interested in that.
[02:49:54.165 --> 02:49:56.566]  They're interested in breaking you.
[02:49:56.566 --> 02:50:02.629]  They want everybody financially and economically on their knees, so they're going to tell you, you're going to pay the old mortgage back.
[02:50:02.629 --> 02:50:04.270]  I don't know how you're going to do it, but do it.
[02:50:04.270 --> 02:50:06.271]  If you don't, we own your house.
[02:50:06.271 --> 02:50:08.472]  All right, let's take one more caller before the break.
[02:50:08.472 --> 02:50:11.493]  Eddie in New Hampshire, quickly.
[02:50:11.493 --> 02:50:12.694]  Hi, Bob Peterson?
[02:50:12.694 --> 02:50:13.795]  Yes.
[02:50:13.795 --> 02:50:14.515]  Hi, good afternoon.
[02:50:15.205 --> 02:50:16.205]  I just had a quick question.
[02:50:16.205 --> 02:50:21.707]  Bob, a couple weeks ago I heard you mention that you believe at some point that the stock market could go down as little as $2,500 to $3,000.
[02:50:21.707 --> 02:50:27.629]  I just wanted to know if you have... $2,832 is the number, but that's close enough.
[02:50:27.629 --> 02:50:28.909]  Okay.
[02:50:28.909 --> 02:50:33.991]  If you had to guess, do you believe that decline is going to be gradual, or do you expect one major event?
[02:50:33.991 --> 02:50:35.311]  I just said that, Bob.
[02:50:35.311 --> 02:50:37.132]  I think it'll be gradual because of the...
[02:50:39.455 --> 02:50:45.920]  We're going to come back after this.
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:49.443]  It's the Alex Jones Show final segment with Bob Chapman.
[02:50:49.443 --> 02:50:52.285]  Infowars.com and streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:51:52.864 --> 02:51:53.244]  MyPillow.

[02:52:01.215 --> 02:52:03.618]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.618 --> 02:52:05.921]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.921 --> 02:52:09.124]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.124 --> 02:52:14.250]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.250 --> 02:52:18.435]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.735 --> 02:52:21.198]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.198 --> 02:52:23.640]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.640 --> 02:52:26.883]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.883 --> 02:52:34.471]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.824 --> 02:52:40.228]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.228 --> 02:52:43.069]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.069 --> 02:52:46.752]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.752 --> 02:52:47.833]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.833 --> 02:52:49.173]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.173 --> 02:52:50.674]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:05.942]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[02:53:05.942 --> 02:53:06.642]  Listen.
[02:53:06.642 --> 02:53:10.904]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[02:53:10.904 --> 02:53:14.305]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[02:53:14.305 --> 02:53:17.346]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[02:53:17.346 --> 02:53:20.727]  They wanted me to go on Plavix but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[02:53:21.129 --> 02:53:29.534]  Heart and Body Extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[02:53:29.534 --> 02:53:32.096]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[02:53:32.096 --> 02:53:36.699]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[02:53:36.699 --> 02:53:40.922]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.

[02:54:05.846 --> 02:54:08.147]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:08.147 --> 02:54:10.189]  I am Jason Burrus, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:54:10.189 --> 02:54:11.890]  We're joined by Bob Chapman.
[02:54:11.890 --> 02:54:14.512]  We've got Alex coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:14.512 --> 02:54:17.694]  Bob's going to hang over until the 5 after marker with us.
[02:54:17.694 --> 02:54:28.861]  And you were just finishing up how you don't think that the stock market collapse, and you said it could collapse to 2800 to 3500 points, will be a gradual one, Bob.
[02:54:28.861 --> 02:54:30.282]  Well, probably.
[02:54:30.282 --> 02:54:31.143]  What is gradual?
[02:54:32.095 --> 02:54:37.538]  We might have it drop three or four thousand points and rally and then go down again and so on.
[02:54:37.538 --> 02:54:38.898]  It's hard to say.
[02:54:38.898 --> 02:54:41.820]  Nobody can predict that, but it is going lower.
[02:54:41.820 --> 02:54:43.380]  And there's a lot of reasons why.
[02:54:43.380 --> 02:54:49.963]  I mean, part of the reason for the whole world economy to be in the state it's in is because it was planned that way.
[02:54:49.963 --> 02:54:56.046]  And if you can accept that, you can see why they want the market down eventually.
[02:54:56.046 --> 02:54:57.827]  And that's because they want to destroy
[02:54:58.547 --> 02:54:59.027]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:59.027 --> 02:54:59.487]  Good afternoon.
[02:55:29.175 --> 02:55:40.925]  First of all, I want to say congratulations on being more relevant and focused every day, bringing us the most concise boil down of all the information we're not finding anywhere else.
[02:55:40.925 --> 02:55:51.654]  And also, obviously, Bob Chapman is a great example of all of the informed and really insightful people who we need to be listening to right now.
[02:55:52.636 --> 02:55:57.078]  First of all, I want to give a shout out to Justin, or whatever was his name yesterday.
[02:55:57.078 --> 02:56:00.079]  That was the most refreshing thing to hear, that call.
[02:56:00.079 --> 02:56:01.359]  Alright, thank you so much, sir.
[02:56:01.359 --> 02:56:04.220]  Let's go to Ricky in Florida.
[02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:05.801]  Ricky, you're on the line.
[02:56:05.801 --> 02:56:06.281]  Man.
[02:56:06.281 --> 02:56:07.941]  Yeah, hi, my name is Richard Keene.
[02:56:07.941 --> 02:56:13.123]  I'm a narrator for the movie about naked short-selling called Stark Shark.
[02:56:13.123 --> 02:56:15.244]  And I had a question.
[02:56:15.244 --> 02:56:21.506]  As far as Goldman Sachs, the FBI put out a report about Sergei Lenikoff.
[02:56:22.557 --> 02:56:26.881]  Transferring a thousand secret codes and files to a German website?
[02:56:26.881 --> 02:56:31.906]  Is there some kind of connection to Germany?
[02:56:31.906 --> 02:56:38.532]  I really don't know because, you know, right after that happened, we got no further information.
[02:56:38.532 --> 02:56:40.494]  Nothing.
[02:56:40.494 --> 02:56:42.856]  Bob, to be honest, I don't even know what this is.
[02:56:42.856 --> 02:56:45.778]  Could you go over basically what the caller's talking about here quickly?
[02:56:45.778 --> 02:56:47.220]  Because I'm not sure what the topic is.
[02:56:47.628 --> 02:57:03.798]  Well, the caller said that a gentleman worked for Goldman Sachs, stopped working for them, and before he did that, these algorithms which he created, he transferred it to a German company.
[02:57:03.798 --> 02:57:11.203]  And Goldman was saying, well, you can't do that, and we're bringing criminal charges against you rather than the civil.
[02:57:11.203 --> 02:57:17.067]  And the FBI came and picked him up, and then he was released, and we heard nothing further about it.
[02:57:17.648 --> 02:57:24.071]  Which tells me, probably, that Goldman didn't have a case, otherwise we would have heard about it.
[02:57:24.071 --> 02:57:26.852]  Alright, let's go to our next caller, Jeff in Michigan.
[02:57:26.852 --> 02:57:28.993]  Jeff, you're on the line.
[02:57:28.993 --> 02:57:30.034]  Hey guys, how are you doing?
[02:57:30.034 --> 02:57:31.515]  Good.
[02:57:31.515 --> 02:57:40.019]  I wanted to see if you, Bob, if you agree with my interpretation of the situation.
[02:57:40.019 --> 02:57:46.982]  I believe that we can best find a solution to what the situation we're in by studying
[02:57:47.826 --> 02:57:52.947]  The root source of where, the pivot point, where it all happened.
[02:57:52.947 --> 02:58:00.249]  I agree with what a previous caller was talking about the UCC law and how a debt, if refused, should be discharged.
[02:58:00.249 --> 02:58:05.590]  Because the pivot point for me is House Joint Resolution 192.
[02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:10.411]  Because when you take away gold and silver as money, you take away the Constitution.
[02:58:10.411 --> 02:58:11.411]  It's a contract.
[02:58:11.411 --> 02:58:12.371]  It's one piece.
[02:58:12.371 --> 02:58:16.712]  We can't just take away a section of the Constitution and expect the rest to be there.
[02:58:17.355 --> 02:58:25.479]  When they set aside the Constitution, took away gold and silver as money, they took away legitimate government as well as legitimate law.
[02:58:25.479 --> 02:58:27.761]  All law now is commerce.
[02:58:27.761 --> 02:58:32.183]  I started learning about this because of that movie you were in, Jason.
[02:58:32.183 --> 02:58:34.404]  Hijacking Humanity, Paul Verge.
[02:58:34.404 --> 02:58:34.964]  Great film.
[02:58:34.964 --> 02:58:38.406]  We're going to come back and get Bob Chapman's take and continue to take your calls.
[02:58:38.406 --> 02:58:39.287]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:41.558 --> 02:58:47.222]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.222 --> 02:58:50.945]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:50.945 --> 02:58:52.246]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.246 --> 02:58:57.830]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:57.830 --> 02:59:02.853]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:02.853 --> 02:59:03.334]  It's true.
[02:59:03.334 --> 02:59:06.136]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:59:06.136 --> 02:59:07.877]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:08.417 --> 02:59:13.641]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:13.641 --> 02:59:15.942]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:59:15.942 --> 02:59:20.745]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:20.745 --> 02:59:21.866]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:21.866 --> 02:59:24.948]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:59:24.948 --> 02:59:28.571]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:28.571 --> 02:59:31.753]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:31.753 --> 02:59:33.974]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:33.974 --> 02:59:34.895]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:38.617 --> 02:59:41.500]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:47.604]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:47.604 --> 02:59:54.129]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseabank.com.
[02:59:54.129 --> 02:59:56.531]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.531 --> 02:59:59.293]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:05.623 --> 03:00:07.504]  We are back live.
[03:00:07.504 --> 03:00:08.745]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:08.745 --> 03:00:10.386]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in.
[03:00:10.386 --> 03:00:12.548]  We've got Bob Chapman on the line.
[03:00:12.548 --> 03:00:15.529]  Alex coming up at the eight after.
[03:00:15.529 --> 03:00:17.331]  Uh, let's continue to take your calls.
[03:00:17.331 --> 03:00:19.792]  I believe we're on Jeff in Michigan.
[03:00:19.792 --> 03:00:22.674]  Jeff, you're online.
[03:00:22.674 --> 03:00:23.435]  Or did we just go to Jeff?
[03:00:23.435 --> 03:00:23.995]  Yeah, we're stuck in a...
[03:00:25.063 --> 03:00:33.706]  Yeah, I was talking about the House Joint Resolution 192 and the removal of money, lawful money, and how it removes the Constitution.
[03:00:33.706 --> 03:00:34.966]  Let's get Bob's take on that.
[03:00:34.966 --> 03:00:38.947]  Bob, are we ever going to reinstitute a gold or silver standard?
[03:00:38.947 --> 03:00:39.848]  Is that what we need?
[03:00:39.848 --> 03:00:47.890]  The privately owned Fed and Congress don't care what the law says.
[03:00:47.890 --> 03:00:49.751]  You heard what the last president said about
[03:00:50.885 --> 03:00:58.710]  But don't worry, Jim Cramer will tell you that the Bavarian Illuminati and Goldman Sachs and the Queen of England aren't all that bad, Bob.
[03:01:19.176 --> 03:01:20.476]  I know that.
[03:01:20.476 --> 03:01:22.137]  And he gets paid to do that.
[03:01:22.137 --> 03:01:24.117]  I don't get paid to do anything.
[03:01:24.117 --> 03:01:24.577]  Absolutely.
[03:01:24.577 --> 03:01:26.878]  Let's jam in a couple more callers.
[03:01:26.878 --> 03:01:28.278]  Seth in California.
[03:01:28.278 --> 03:01:30.638]  Seth, you're on the line.
[03:01:30.638 --> 03:01:33.919]  Hey, first off, I want to say, Jason, Invisible Empire was awesome.
[03:01:33.919 --> 03:01:35.299]  Oh, thank you.
[03:01:35.299 --> 03:01:36.440]  Thank you.
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:38.620]  I just had a quick question about a couple of days ago.
[03:01:38.620 --> 03:01:43.541]  It came out that Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JP Morgan and Citigroup made money.
[03:01:43.541 --> 03:01:47.502]  They made profit every single day of the first quarter on the stock market.
[03:01:48.363 --> 03:01:49.884]  And I mean, I haven't heard too much about it.
[03:01:49.884 --> 03:01:52.727]  It came out of Bloomberg, but why isn't there?
[03:01:52.727 --> 03:01:54.709]  I'll answer that for you.
[03:01:54.709 --> 03:01:56.990]  I was a professional trader for 25 years.
[03:01:56.990 --> 03:01:58.972]  I own my own firm.
[03:01:58.972 --> 03:02:04.537]  And if you can make trades where you're right, 55% of the time, you're really a big winner.
[03:02:04.537 --> 03:02:11.583]  So in order to have a net at the end of every day for four major banks for three months,
[03:02:12.654 --> 03:02:15.877]  Is absolutely impossible.
[03:02:15.877 --> 03:02:19.221]  They had to be running on inside information.
[03:02:19.221 --> 03:02:25.807]  And they are doing everything that they want to do at these major banking institutions.
[03:02:25.807 --> 03:02:28.310]  Used to be called brokerage houses too.
[03:02:28.310 --> 03:02:29.691]  And I'll tell you why.
[03:02:29.691 --> 03:02:36.398]  I just got a letter today from a friend of mine who attends the Fed meetings.
[03:02:37.859 --> 03:02:48.282]  And he says that by the end of the year, maybe as early as November, that the banking system is going to come down.
[03:02:48.282 --> 03:03:01.185]  And he says that they believe that all of the banks will be wrapped up in those five or six major banks in the United States, and they will control everything from a banking viewpoint.
[03:03:01.185 --> 03:03:02.165]  And that's what they're after.
[03:03:02.952 --> 03:03:13.337]  TheInternationalForecaster.com is the website, or you can call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237 and get their latest and greatest deals on gold and silver.
[03:03:13.337 --> 03:03:15.798]  Final caller, Blue in Tennessee.
[03:03:15.798 --> 03:03:17.699]  Blue, you're on the line.
[03:03:17.699 --> 03:03:18.419]  Hello, thank you gentlemen.
[03:03:18.419 --> 03:03:27.283]  One of my big questions, what about the possibility of collecting copper for those of us that do not have enough money to invest in silver and gold?
[03:03:28.837 --> 03:03:35.242]  Well, a government, if you collect pennies, the government says that it's illegal to destroy them.
[03:03:35.242 --> 03:03:41.526]  But if you go out and collect copper, you've got to remember that it's a commodity, and it can range anywhere from $62 a pound to $4.20 a pound.
[03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:56.831]  So there's a risk factor in there and if we eventually have a deflationary depression, the value of commodities would eventually fall.
[03:03:56.831 --> 03:03:57.772]  And Bob, let me say this.
[03:03:57.772 --> 03:04:02.597]  I refuse to believe that anybody out there can't get involved in silver.
[03:04:02.597 --> 03:04:07.162]  If you go to McDonald's, you're going to spend more money on feeding.
[03:04:07.782 --> 03:04:16.413]  Yourself and your wife and your kid on a bet on a few value meals than you would on one silver ounce coin That's the reality anybody can get into silver Bob.
[03:04:16.413 --> 03:04:17.154]  I just don't believe it
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:19.980]  Well, you're right.
[03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:22.021]  And it's much easier than copper, that's for sure.
[03:04:22.021 --> 03:04:24.922]  Yeah, I mean, copper is $62 by the pound at the best.
[03:04:24.922 --> 03:04:25.942]  Is that a joke?
[03:04:25.942 --> 03:04:27.563]  Can you even imagine it?
[03:04:27.563 --> 03:04:29.163]  Folks, we had a great show.
[03:04:29.163 --> 03:04:32.244]  We got Alex Jones coming up in about five minutes.
[03:04:32.244 --> 03:04:33.605]  Some of the things we couldn't cover.
[03:04:33.605 --> 03:04:36.786]  Obama's top intelligence advisor resigns.
[03:04:36.786 --> 03:04:38.826]  Again, Apple has changed their tune.
[03:04:38.826 --> 03:04:41.347]  They're now accepting cash for the iPad.

[03:06:11.254 --> 03:06:18.640]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:06:18.640 --> 03:06:23.523]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:06:32.209 --> 03:06:34.510]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[03:06:53.462 --> 03:06:54.463]  Thank you!
[03:07:04.611 --> 03:07:05.852]  Tyranny is here.
[03:07:05.852 --> 03:07:09.416]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:07:09.416 --> 03:07:12.199]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:07:12.199 --> 03:07:17.905]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:07:17.905 --> 03:07:24.152]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:07:24.552 --> 03:07:30.513]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:07:30.513 --> 03:07:34.714]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:07:34.714 --> 03:07:38.995]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:07:38.995 --> 03:07:44.936]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:07:44.936 --> 03:07:48.496]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:07:48.496 --> 03:07:50.477]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:07:50.477 --> 03:07:50.897]  It's here.

[03:08:11.802 --> 03:08:12.723]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:12.723 --> 03:08:17.549]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.549 --> 03:08:22.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:22.435 --> 03:08:24.899]  We're live, 8 minutes into the third hour.
[03:08:25.539 --> 03:08:28.442]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[03:08:28.442 --> 03:08:35.388]  That television program is on BBC, Al Jazeera, RT, being picked up for its second highly rated season.
[03:08:35.388 --> 03:08:36.369]  He is with us.
[03:08:36.369 --> 03:08:37.330]  He's normally here once a month.
[03:08:37.330 --> 03:08:42.695]  This is his scheduled monthly visit, but I had him on last week because of the quickening and his predictions coming true.
[03:08:43.235 --> 03:09:03.988]  After he was on, what, last Monday, breaking down the fact that there was clear evidence that this was financial terrorism with a thousand point plunge, and that the financial wolves, or hyenas, the wolf packs, were bringing down Europe, the very same central banks controlled by the big brokerage firms and investment banks like J.P.
[03:09:03.988 --> 03:09:05.589]  Morgan, Chase, Goldman Sachs,
[03:09:06.249 --> 03:09:07.490]  Yeah man, great to be back with you Alex!
[03:09:34.417 --> 03:09:37.419]  Alright my friend, you've got the floor for the balance of this segment.
[03:09:37.419 --> 03:09:50.570]  Lay out where we are, what's happening, what's going on in Europe, what's going on with Brown stepping down, Merkel in trouble, saying the banks are criminal, what's happening in the markets, a trillion's not enough, they need more, what is happening right now?
[03:09:51.894 --> 03:09:55.095]  Alrighty, well, let's talk first about Greece.
[03:09:55.095 --> 03:10:10.461]  Now, George Papandreou, the leader in Greece, he made a statement yesterday, over the weekend, that he's now going to investigate what role the Wall Street banks played in destabilizing his country, his economy.
[03:10:10.461 --> 03:10:15.943]  And this is through some back-channel communication between myself and folks in Greece.
[03:10:16.623 --> 03:10:27.346]  And I've been trying to steer them in the right direction, telling them this isn't a market problem, it's not a market failure, but it's fraud that's been perpetrated primarily by Wall Street banks.
[03:10:27.346 --> 03:10:38.850]  And my message got through, and he said yesterday that he hears words like a need for transparency, and there's fraud, and now he's going to take a stand against the bankers.
[03:10:38.850 --> 03:10:39.990]  Now, historically,
[03:10:40.410 --> 03:10:47.915]  When anybody has taken, anyone in politics, has taken a stand against the bankers, they immediately put themselves into, you know, quite a bit of danger.
[03:10:47.915 --> 03:10:59.262]  Because the track record, if you go, you know, even if you read John Perkins' book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, whenever somebody, a leader of a country, steps up against the bankers, they put themselves into grave danger.
[03:10:59.262 --> 03:11:04.325]  Now, this would be the first time, really, that a major Western economy is taking on the Wall Street banks.
[03:11:04.905 --> 03:11:09.766]  But the people in Greece are out in the streets, and the leadership is responding.
[03:11:09.766 --> 03:11:11.487]  So he's making a statement.
[03:11:11.487 --> 03:11:21.890]  So we're going to see, because there's ample proof that the Wall Street banks purposefully crashed the Greek economy for short-term capital gains.
[03:11:21.890 --> 03:11:24.591]  So that's the first thing that's happening.
[03:11:24.591 --> 03:11:25.451]  What's happening in Iceland,
[03:11:26.855 --> 03:11:35.903]  You know, we made a film in Iceland about the collapse of the corona, the collapse of the Icelandic economy, and I've gotten pretty friendly with a lot of the legislators up in Iceland.
[03:11:35.903 --> 03:11:41.788]  I'm proposing to them that they introduce some new economic citizenship.
[03:11:42.208 --> 03:11:46.009]  So that anyone in the world who wants to escape, for example a U.S.
[03:11:46.009 --> 03:11:48.910]  citizen who wants to escape the tyranny of the U.S.
[03:11:48.910 --> 03:11:53.131]  can buy a passport for Iceland and to make it competitive.
[03:11:53.131 --> 03:11:55.051]  So it only costs $20,000.
[03:11:55.051 --> 03:11:59.712]  Right now there's only two territories or countries that offer economic citizenship, Nevis, St.
[03:11:59.712 --> 03:12:01.613]  Kitts and Dominica.
[03:12:01.613 --> 03:12:01.993]  They're both
[03:12:02.774 --> 03:12:03.695]  I don't think so.
[03:12:17.657 --> 03:12:18.397]  Alright, let me stop you!
[03:12:45.135 --> 03:12:45.796]  I don't know.
[03:12:57.509 --> 03:12:58.850]  Okay, the global insurrection is on.
[03:12:58.850 --> 03:13:04.755]  I want to interject this and get your take on it, and I want to back you up here and have you continue.
[03:13:04.755 --> 03:13:06.096]  This is French news agency.
[03:13:06.096 --> 03:13:11.179]  Bankers jailed, sued as Iceland seeks culprits for crisis.
[03:13:11.179 --> 03:13:19.105]  Then a week ago we saw the Merkel headline where she called, you know, it criminal banks causing this, though she's bought and paid for by them.
[03:13:19.105 --> 03:13:24.890]  So isn't that the danger with the Greek leader and others, is that they see the headlights
[03:13:25.430 --> 03:13:25.650]  I think?
[03:13:42.682 --> 03:13:44.004]  I mean, isn't there a danger of that?
[03:13:44.004 --> 03:13:50.753]  Because I've been all over Greek radio and newspapers as well saying, arrest the bankers, arrest Goldman Sachs.
[03:13:50.753 --> 03:13:54.218]  And so you've been putting the pressure on, many others have been putting the pressure on.
[03:13:54.218 --> 03:13:56.822]  So that's a great idea.
[03:13:56.822 --> 03:13:58.304]  Secondarily, how you brought up
[03:13:58.844 --> 03:13:59.645]  Expatriates!
[03:13:59.645 --> 03:14:07.532]  We have the New York Times saying record numbers of wealthy people who aren't globalists leaving because they say this is the last year to get your money out.
[03:14:07.532 --> 03:14:08.753]  Just fleeing en masse.
[03:14:08.753 --> 03:14:12.476]  I'd rather flee to somewhere like Iceland, but I don't even have enough money, I don't think.
[03:14:12.476 --> 03:14:15.799]  Like you said, if it was $200,000, I think I'm going to stay here and go down with the ship.
[03:14:15.799 --> 03:14:19.803]  But for people that do want to escape and be around like-minded people.
[03:14:19.803 --> 03:14:23.386]  But what about the arrests that they're reporting in Iceland?
[03:14:24.485 --> 03:14:25.366]  That's right.
[03:14:25.366 --> 03:14:37.553]  One of the bankers in London, who they say, and rightfully so, was responsible for pilfering $2 billion from the economy, is now being prosecuted.
[03:14:37.553 --> 03:14:47.619]  It's funny because London is where a lot of these guys go to get, because the hedge fund industry and the banking industry laws are very lenient there, and you end up with
[03:14:47.619 --> 03:15:04.833]  A lot of the international banking crooks end up in London, which is one of the reasons why the real estate market in London, on the high end, the very expensive residencies, hasn't crashed so much because they're supported by all these billionaires from these territories that they've absconded with all the wealth.
[03:15:04.833 --> 03:15:13.360]  So Iceland is actively going after this guy, and it's funny because in the indictment they use a very interesting word, Alex.
[03:15:13.360 --> 03:15:15.022]  They use the word counterfeiting.
[03:15:15.922 --> 03:15:29.110]  Now, this is fascinating because counterfeiting in the context of financial crime and financial terrorism, it points to what people know as naked short selling.
[03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:32.312]  Naked short selling is really one of the most common
[03:15:32.312 --> 03:15:38.933]  Common incendiary financial devices used to blow up an economy and to blow up a country, to blow up a company.
[03:15:38.933 --> 03:15:41.914]  We saw it with Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, naked short selling.
[03:15:41.914 --> 03:15:47.975]  You're selling something, you're selling a security that doesn't exist, which is the same as counterfeiting.
[03:15:47.975 --> 03:15:58.517]  So now if they bring this whole naked short selling scam to the surface and they call it what it is, counterfeiting, that would point the finger at a lot of the criminality that's going on in the last five to ten years.
[03:15:58.877 --> 03:16:04.164]  And really bring in all the banks because they're all guilty of this naked short selling to a huge degree.
[03:16:04.164 --> 03:16:11.834]  Now getting back to your question about, well, the leaders, once they take on Wall Street, are they going to be pressured to back down?
[03:16:11.834 --> 03:16:13.996]  And what we saw last Thursday on May 6th,
[03:16:15.305 --> 03:16:18.268]  Was the first unequivocal domestic financial terrorist attack in America.
[03:16:18.268 --> 03:16:22.712]  You know, there was a bill in Washington to break up the big banks.
[03:16:22.712 --> 03:16:26.095]  They dropped the market by a thousand points.
[03:16:26.095 --> 03:16:27.596]  The lawmakers pulled away.
[03:16:27.596 --> 03:16:29.898]  They decided not to pass that law to break up the big banks.
[03:16:29.898 --> 03:16:33.702]  They also dropped the real law at the Fed and put a fake one in according to Ron Paul.
[03:16:34.422 --> 03:16:38.843]  Yeah, so they've got this weapon, which is they can crash a market.
[03:16:38.843 --> 03:16:49.286]  And I'm looking at today's news, and you see now that the financial terrorists are not shy about threatening to blow up people's economies and markets.
[03:16:49.286 --> 03:16:52.987]  For example, if this is in today's news, Morgan Stanley said that
[03:16:54.208 --> 03:17:08.667]  If Europe doesn't engage in full-blown quantitative easing, which means that they would buy back their own bonds, which basically would mean to destroy the euro, then Morgan Stanley threatens Europe with a 1987 crash.
[03:17:10.869 --> 03:17:11.410]  Look this up.
[03:17:11.410 --> 03:17:17.820]  Morgan Stanley, full-blown quantitative easing may be needed to save Europe, or else we'll see a 1987-style crash.
[03:17:17.820 --> 03:17:20.103]  So they're threatening Europe with a 1987 crash.
[03:17:20.103 --> 03:17:21.565]  That's Morgan Stanley.
[03:17:21.565 --> 03:17:25.071]  A Wall Street bank is threatening the entire Eurozone.
[03:17:27.173 --> 03:17:39.307]  Here's another headline about KPMG and PricewaterhouseCooper are now considering whether or not they should get back into the business of the rating agencies.
[03:17:39.307 --> 03:17:47.317]  You know, the Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, those rating agencies that gave their blessing to all the structured products and collateralized debt obligations that turned out to be phony?
[03:17:47.817 --> 03:17:57.559]  Well, now all these consulting firms, who are also equally culpable in this nightmarish collapse of the economy, say, well, you know, those guys aren't good enough at it.
[03:17:57.559 --> 03:17:58.919]  We're going to get into business.
[03:17:58.919 --> 03:18:03.520]  So this is, like, really just exactly the same thing.
[03:18:03.520 --> 03:18:11.681]  The fact that they can, with a straight face, say that they're going to get into the rating agency business when they themselves are some of the most crooked organizations in the U.S.
[03:18:11.681 --> 03:18:14.822]  economy, KPMG and Pricewaterhouse, is quite laughable.
[03:18:15.602 --> 03:18:25.450]  Here we have General Motors today saying that they want to get back into the financing business because of the shortage of subprime lending is holding back sales.
[03:18:25.450 --> 03:18:34.416]  Now, General Motors getting into the financing business is exactly how the economy crashed to begin with, because they got out of selling cars and they got into the loan sharking business.
[03:18:34.416 --> 03:18:44.404]  Then the economy crashed, then the government gave them billions, and as a thank you to the taxpayer for getting them out of the hole, they're saying, now we want to get back into the loan sharking business.
[03:18:44.804 --> 03:18:45.764]  That only took 12 months!
[03:18:59.148 --> 03:19:04.415]  At usurious rates, as a loan shark, and we're trying to get you deeper into debt as we possibly can.
[03:19:04.415 --> 03:19:14.368]  And so they're trying to restart the entire cycle again until they blow up and then they'll require more of a bailout.
[03:19:14.368 --> 03:19:16.711]  And of course this just perpetuates this move.
[03:19:17.431 --> 03:19:29.094]  Down into what we would call the casino gulag state, where the value of the purchasing power, the wages and the savings, and the purchasing power of everybody in the U.S.
[03:19:29.094 --> 03:19:32.494]  keeps continuously degrades and drops and disintegrates.
[03:19:32.494 --> 03:19:39.416]  And you have just an enormous cesspool where once a fine country used to reside.
[03:19:42.256 --> 03:19:43.016]  Well said.
[03:19:43.016 --> 03:19:49.439]  I've got a bunch of questions for you in the next short segment, then we're going to get into other issues you think are important to cover, and then take phone calls.
[03:19:49.439 --> 03:19:52.080]  One of my questions is, will the U.S.
[03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:53.560]  market collapse?
[03:19:53.560 --> 03:19:54.561]  When will it collapse?
[03:19:54.561 --> 03:19:56.582]  If it does, and how will it collapse?
[03:19:56.582 --> 03:19:58.342]  That's all coming up with Max Keiser.
[03:19:58.342 --> 03:20:00.223]  I'm Alex Jones at FoalWars.com.
[03:20:01.681 --> 03:20:04.063]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:20:04.063 --> 03:20:06.384]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:20:06.384 --> 03:20:09.607]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:20:09.607 --> 03:20:14.710]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:20:14.710 --> 03:20:18.893]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:20:19.213 --> 03:20:21.556]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:20:21.556 --> 03:20:24.440]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:20:24.440 --> 03:20:27.364]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:20:27.364 --> 03:20:34.974]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:20:35.294 --> 03:20:40.699]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:20:40.699 --> 03:20:43.542]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:20:43.542 --> 03:20:47.225]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:20:47.225 --> 03:20:48.306]  And I got news for you.
[03:20:48.306 --> 03:20:49.647]  You're everyone else.
[03:20:49.647 --> 03:20:51.149]  Invisible Empire.

[03:24:08.645 --> 03:24:10.365]  MaxKeiser.com.
[03:24:10.365 --> 03:24:12.726]  Your call is coming up in the next segment.
[03:24:12.726 --> 03:24:14.927]  Max, I talked to one of my neighbors.
[03:24:14.927 --> 03:24:19.229]  I talked to other people that are somewhat successful in business in Austin.
[03:24:19.229 --> 03:24:22.771]  And they say, well, I'm not in the stock market, so I don't care what these big banks are doing.
[03:24:24.502 --> 03:24:40.091]  And I don't understand this yuppie pre-programmed arrogance where you try to warn people that you know and they act like it's weak to even care or even be involved in society as long as they think they're doing okay.
[03:24:40.911 --> 03:24:43.032]  I mean, everyone is connected to the stock market.
[03:24:43.032 --> 03:24:44.593]  Everyone is connected to the currencies.
[03:24:44.593 --> 03:24:50.975]  Everyone is connected through taxes with these trillions of dollars of, quote, bailouts used for bonuses.
[03:24:50.975 --> 03:25:01.059]  I mean, what do you call that mindset where people don't understand the incredible magnitude of what's happening in global markets right now and where this is leading us?
[03:25:02.743 --> 03:25:06.568]  Well, you can explain it in the following way.
[03:25:06.568 --> 03:25:19.363]  The average experience of the average American is masked to a large degree by the fact that most people in America are unaware of the benefits accrued to them.
[03:25:20.064 --> 03:25:23.845]  Because the world reserve currency is the US dollar.
[03:25:23.845 --> 03:25:31.487]  So there is no radical currency risk that you see in other countries, and the currency collapses that you see in other countries.
[03:25:31.487 --> 03:25:38.088]  And it also means that things like gasoline are incredibly cheap in America relative to other countries.
[03:25:38.088 --> 03:25:45.670]  Now what is going to happen, what people on your show are talking about, and what I've been talking about, and what I see over here in Europe,
[03:25:46.230 --> 03:25:46.370]  Yes.
[03:26:04.435 --> 03:26:05.456]  I don't know.
[03:26:21.128 --> 03:26:32.857]  You know, it's happening right now because the special drawing rights that are being used right now as part of this huge reconfiguration of the European banking system and the trillion dollar that the U.S.
[03:26:32.857 --> 03:26:38.160]  gave Europe to unwind their banks' risky positions.
[03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:42.564]  Part of that is the introduction of another $300 billion in special drawing rights.
[03:26:42.564 --> 03:26:48.248]  So the special drawing rights are creeping into the global currency system.
[03:26:48.248 --> 03:26:49.629]  At some point they will
[03:26:50.249 --> 03:26:57.455]  Be comparable to other major currencies in terms of the amount traded, and the scope, and the influence.
[03:26:57.455 --> 03:27:03.200]  And then you'll start to see things quoted in special drawing rights, and they'll normalize the special drawing right.
[03:27:03.200 --> 03:27:10.325]  And then it'll be announced that, as part of Brennan Woods 2, they're going to reconfigure the global currency grid.
[03:27:10.325 --> 03:27:10.746]  The U.S.
[03:27:10.746 --> 03:27:14.769]  dollar will be devalued by 50%, like it was in the 30s.
[03:27:14.769 --> 03:27:17.231]  Gold will be upwardly valued to $5,000 or $10,000 an ounce.
[03:27:18.952 --> 03:27:20.714]  And then people in the U.S.
[03:27:20.714 --> 03:27:23.898]  will have a deferred awakening.
[03:27:23.898 --> 03:27:31.927]  Because since World War II, they've really had the benefit of, they've had the World War II dividend, which has stretched out for 60, 65 years.
[03:27:33.609 --> 03:27:33.889]  I think so.
[03:27:52.669 --> 03:28:00.197]  Now, as soon as that situation ends, as it is happening right now, you'll have this incredible, you know, shock.
[03:28:00.197 --> 03:28:04.301]  And then it'll be way, way, way too late to do anything about it.
[03:28:04.301 --> 03:28:06.984]  So, I can understand why people are in a coma.
[03:28:07.882 --> 03:28:11.563]  When it comes to understanding the position of the U.S.
[03:28:11.563 --> 03:28:23.988]  relative to the rest of the world, and I can also anticipate that when this thing finally makes the break, there's going to be an incredible gasp of horror that'll just go from coast to coast.
[03:28:23.988 --> 03:28:25.969]  There will be absolute shock.
[03:28:25.969 --> 03:28:27.329]  How did this happen?
[03:28:32.132 --> 03:28:59.134]  And the banks will say, the big mega banks will say, don't worry, we're going to save you again with SDRs, we're transcending national currencies and we'll just make up to the power of infinity whatever amount of fiat money we want and you're going to pay us taxes on the right to use this new global cashless society system and they'll just bypass the three global regional currencies that the Trilateral Commission talked about in the 1970s, correct?
[03:29:01.682 --> 03:29:04.004]  That is basically correct.
[03:29:04.004 --> 03:29:13.751]  In other words, with the introduction of the Special Drawing Right, they will have another way to add another layer to this global Ponzi scheme, where all of the U.S.
[03:29:13.751 --> 03:29:18.635]  dollar-denominated debts will be re-securitized.
[03:29:18.635 --> 03:29:21.397]  Most of the debt will be off the balance sheet.
[03:29:21.397 --> 03:29:27.962]  Some of it will be included in the new SDR, but the SDR will be loaded up with more debt than even the U.S.
[03:29:27.962 --> 03:29:30.684]  dollar, and the result will be this
[03:29:31.144 --> 03:29:37.027]  Constant downward pressure from above where no wages ever go up.
[03:29:37.027 --> 03:29:42.791]  No savers ever get a return greater than .0001% on their savings.
[03:29:42.791 --> 03:29:49.134]  And you end up in this casino gulag state where the only way anyone can make any more money than subsistence... Stay there!
[03:29:49.134 --> 03:29:49.775]  Got a break!
[03:29:49.775 --> 03:29:51.776]  Stay there!
[03:29:51.776 --> 03:29:53.177]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.177 --> 03:29:55.698]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.698 --> 03:29:58.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.499 --> 03:30:08.162]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:30:08.162 --> 03:30:13.305]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:30:13.305 --> 03:30:22.029]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:30:22.029 --> 03:30:26.091]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[03:30:26.091 --> 03:30:28.432]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[03:30:30.530 --> 03:30:35.111]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:30:35.111 --> 03:30:38.952]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[03:30:38.952 --> 03:30:40.172]  Others don't.

[03:32:01.428 --> 03:32:05.971]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:32:05.971 --> 03:32:06.891]  Number one.
[03:32:06.891 --> 03:32:10.313]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:32:10.313 --> 03:32:11.173]  Number two.
[03:32:11.173 --> 03:32:16.056]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:32:16.056 --> 03:32:16.816]  It's true.
[03:32:16.816 --> 03:32:21.359]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:32:21.679 --> 03:32:22.500]  Number 3.
[03:32:22.500 --> 03:32:26.082]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:32:26.082 --> 03:32:30.005]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:32:30.005 --> 03:32:30.806]  Number 4.
[03:32:30.806 --> 03:32:33.568]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:32:33.568 --> 03:32:37.251]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:32:37.251 --> 03:32:38.031]  Number 5.
[03:32:38.031 --> 03:32:41.914]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:32:42.174 --> 03:32:47.219]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:32:47.219 --> 03:32:51.403]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:51.403 --> 03:32:53.185]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:53.185 --> 03:32:57.790]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:33:05.629 --> 03:33:12.956]  We're going back to Max Keiser with a few other questions I've got, and then I promise you, in probably five, six minutes, we're going to start going to your calls.
[03:33:12.956 --> 03:33:17.020]  Tom, Rachel, Steven, Ian, Steve, and others.
[03:33:17.020 --> 03:33:20.003]  Again, we're live on this Monday, 17th day of May 2010 edition.
[03:33:20.003 --> 03:33:27.650]  Before we go any further, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast possible.
[03:33:28.717 --> 03:33:30.498]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:33:30.498 --> 03:33:35.141]  He has a free handgun and five days of world-class firearms training waiting for you.
[03:33:35.141 --> 03:33:37.082]  It's not enough to just own guns.
[03:33:37.082 --> 03:33:38.943]  You gotta know how to use them, and this is the place to go.
[03:33:38.943 --> 03:33:47.267]  You're gonna get five days of world-class gun training at Frontside Firearms Training Institute, secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[03:33:47.267 --> 03:33:53.371]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:33:54.091 --> 03:33:56.072]  I believe now is the time to get trained and ready.
[03:33:56.072 --> 03:33:59.535]  There's no drill instructor or boot camp tough guy mentality.
[03:33:59.535 --> 03:34:01.376]  It's got all the training you need.
[03:34:01.376 --> 03:34:03.157]  Two day, four day, five day courses.
[03:34:03.157 --> 03:34:05.578]  Go to Front Sight, like the front of your rifle.
[03:34:05.578 --> 03:34:07.400]  FrontSight.com.
[03:34:07.400 --> 03:34:08.080]  FrontSight.com.
[03:34:10.487 --> 03:34:16.150]  Also, a lot of you are thinking about getting into solar power in your home or your workshop or for camping.
[03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:21.633]  This is a great unit we've been putting out through our sponsors, Lizards from Science, for three years.
[03:34:21.633 --> 03:34:22.893]  I've got nothing but rave reviews.
[03:34:22.893 --> 03:34:26.275]  It's a solar panel system, a control panel, the battery system.
[03:34:26.275 --> 03:34:27.436]  It'll run quite a bit in your house.
[03:34:27.436 --> 03:34:29.356]  You get a bunch of these to run your whole house.
[03:34:29.356 --> 03:34:32.038]  It's a great way to stick more than just your toe, but your foot in.
[03:34:32.718 --> 03:34:36.900]  And it's very affordable, very inexpensive compared to a lot of the systems we've seen.
[03:34:36.900 --> 03:34:40.062]  So you can simply go to MySolarBackup.com.
[03:34:40.062 --> 03:34:40.922]  That's one word.
[03:34:40.922 --> 03:34:45.424]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:34:45.424 --> 03:34:49.086]  Or you can simply call toll-free to get a free information package.
[03:34:49.086 --> 03:34:49.486]  877-327-0365.
[03:34:49.486 --> 03:34:49.567]  877-327-0365.
[03:34:49.567 --> 03:34:50.247]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:34:50.247 --> 03:34:51.007]  And then finally, here,
[03:35:02.367 --> 03:35:06.651]  Invisible Empire, a new world order defined.
[03:35:06.651 --> 03:35:08.733]  Filmed by Jason Burmess, we put out in the last month.
[03:35:08.733 --> 03:35:10.875]  Very, very important material to wake people up.
[03:35:10.875 --> 03:35:13.758]  Folks are waking up, but they don't have all the info.
[03:35:13.758 --> 03:35:15.219]  These films will give it to them.
[03:35:15.219 --> 03:35:17.981]  And of course, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, that I'm in.
[03:35:17.981 --> 03:35:21.164]  Gary Franchi coming up next hour, maybe William Lewis.
[03:35:21.164 --> 03:35:24.888]  Gets into Tenth Amendment, states' rights, grand juries, Second Amendment.
[03:35:25.488 --> 03:35:29.370]  You basically answered my next question in the last segment, but in layman's simple terms.
[03:35:46.858 --> 03:35:47.539]  Yeah.
[03:35:47.539 --> 03:35:50.581]  Do you see Asia plunging next or how far will Europe plunge?
[03:35:50.581 --> 03:35:52.302]  Do you think the Eurozone is going to break up?
[03:35:52.302 --> 03:36:03.030]  The Germans are saying that major German newspapers are calling for a Deutsch Reich zone that only has the richest countries in Europe that are part of it.
[03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:04.911]  So what do you see happening with the Euro?
[03:36:04.911 --> 03:36:09.254]  I mean, I know you can't guess this exactly, but you've been very accurate in the past.
[03:36:09.254 --> 03:36:10.735]  How do you see this unfolding?
[03:36:10.735 --> 03:36:12.957]  Who do you see going down next?
[03:36:12.957 --> 03:36:15.419]  When does this really start to hit the U.S.? ?
[03:36:17.262 --> 03:36:17.743]  Right.
[03:36:17.743 --> 03:36:26.289]  Well, as you say, I've been pretty good at framing this and predicting this.
[03:36:26.289 --> 03:36:31.714]  What you have to understand is you've got a multi-trillion dollar hedge fund business.
[03:36:31.714 --> 03:36:41.622]  You know, a hedge fund is just a fund that is not bound by any restrictions in terms of the types of bets that they can make and the leverage that they have at their disposal.
[03:36:42.362 --> 03:36:43.823]  Availability.
[03:36:43.823 --> 03:36:51.286]  And what they do is they go from currency to currency and they ferret out which ones are the weakest.
[03:36:51.286 --> 03:36:54.047]  They then scare the bejesus out of the folks.
[03:36:54.047 --> 03:36:57.248]  They float rumors about the economic collapse.
[03:36:57.248 --> 03:36:58.508]  They crash the economy.
[03:36:58.508 --> 03:37:01.649]  They make a quick hundred billion dollars or so.
[03:37:01.649 --> 03:37:03.250]  And then they move on.
[03:37:03.250 --> 03:37:05.311]  And from the Eurozone to
[03:37:06.291 --> 03:37:11.095]  I think that they've beat up the Euro pretty good here in the last few weeks.
[03:37:11.095 --> 03:37:13.956]  I think the next stop is the British Pound.
[03:37:13.956 --> 03:37:16.658]  The British Pound, they've got a new government in Britain.
[03:37:16.658 --> 03:37:19.280]  They're trying to bring in some reforms.
[03:37:19.280 --> 03:37:21.922]  They're talking about bringing in banking reform.
[03:37:21.922 --> 03:37:29.787]  So I think that next time we talk, we'll be talking about the tragic fall of the British Pound.
[03:37:29.787 --> 03:37:31.068]  They'll beat that up for a while.
[03:37:32.336 --> 03:37:39.938]  And then they either will go back to Eurozone and attack the Euro, or they may, you know, come back to the U.S.
[03:37:39.938 --> 03:37:40.878]  because the U.S.
[03:37:40.878 --> 03:37:44.299]  is always the currency that these guys know best.
[03:37:44.299 --> 03:37:50.961]  They know how to crash it in the most efficient manner, and it's always in their pocket.
[03:37:50.961 --> 03:37:52.602]  They could always crash the dollar.
[03:37:52.602 --> 03:37:56.663]  That's something they could always do for a quick buck, but you can't do it 100% of the time.
[03:37:56.663 --> 03:38:00.164]  You've got to take turns crashing different currencies at different times.
[03:38:00.604 --> 03:38:06.391]  So I think, the way I see it, the next is the British Pound.
[03:38:06.391 --> 03:38:11.097]  The Japanese Yen is kind of a possibility at some point.
[03:38:11.097 --> 03:38:17.385]  Their economy has gone now 20 straight years of deflation, and it's still highly problematic.
[03:38:17.905 --> 03:38:21.267]  They import something like, you know, 100% of their energy.
[03:38:21.267 --> 03:38:26.571]  So it's really at the mercies of the global economic system.
[03:38:26.571 --> 03:38:30.013]  So that's always a nice one to go in there occasionally.
[03:38:30.013 --> 03:38:33.575]  But they use really the yen, really, as what's called a funding currency.
[03:38:33.575 --> 03:38:34.576]  In other words, they borrow.
[03:38:35.436 --> 03:38:41.862]  In the end, because it's so cheap, and they use that to go attack a country like the UK or the Eurozone.
[03:38:41.862 --> 03:38:47.948]  So it depends on which country has a really weak currency, they use that to borrow, and they go attack another country.
[03:38:47.948 --> 03:39:00.259]  When I was in Reykjavik, right before that economy collapsed, I sat in the 101 Hotel and the sushi bar, and I talked to some bankers from Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and they said,
[03:39:01.620 --> 03:39:07.624]  In about six months, we're going to attack Iceland, and we're going to crash the Icelandic Krona.
[03:39:07.624 --> 03:39:12.427]  And they weren't shy about talking about it, and this is exactly what they did.
[03:39:12.427 --> 03:39:21.353]  Now, a few years later, they're finally getting around to putting some people in jail for counterfeiting and securities fraud, and all kinds of other crimes.
[03:39:21.353 --> 03:39:27.717]  And hopefully they'll put somebody in jail to sit next to Bernie Madoff, and hopefully Lloyd Blankfein will be there shortly.
[03:39:29.770 --> 03:39:38.032]  And if we just continue to point out the Emperor's butt naked and wearing any golden outfit, like the little three-year-old in the Emperor's New Clothes parable...
[03:39:38.632 --> 03:39:40.833]  In fact, guys, print me the Emperor's New Closed Parable.
[03:39:40.833 --> 03:39:42.553]  I want to read that next hour on air.
[03:39:42.553 --> 03:39:45.294]  If we just point out the obvious, it's going to implode.
[03:39:45.294 --> 03:39:58.678]  Max, did you see Fox News, the New York Times, AFP, Reuters, in the last month all come out with a psy-op and say, yes, the troops are helping grow the opium, because if we don't grow it, Al-Qaeda will get the money.
[03:39:58.678 --> 03:40:06.300]  I mean, this had been coming out that our government was there for the opium, $500 billion a year, and shipping it in, and the Russians had said this, but now
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:09.261]  They're so arrogant they hide it in plain view.
[03:40:09.261 --> 03:40:15.244]  It's like... It'd be like President Obama being naked at the podium and saying he wasn't naked.
[03:40:15.244 --> 03:40:17.305]  And we're not supposed to point out he's naked.
[03:40:17.305 --> 03:40:22.608]  So it's some kind of mind control thing where they just come out and say, yeah, we grow the opium.
[03:40:22.608 --> 03:40:25.489]  Have you ever talked to Catherine Austin Fitz about this?
[03:40:25.489 --> 03:40:26.390]  Yeah, the big red button.
[03:40:27.579 --> 03:40:39.383]  She's got an excellent, a lot of work on the CIA, Afghani opium crops, and also, you know, a lot of these hedge funds that you read about, this came out during the savings and loan collapse.
[03:40:39.383 --> 03:40:45.265]  They discovered that many of the hedge funds were actually backed by the government and CIA and other organizations.
[03:40:46.326 --> 03:40:58.016]  And back in the 2008 crash, when Hank Paulson put the gun to Congress' head and said, give us $700 billion or we're going to crash the economy, a lot of people in Congress were actually short bank stocks.
[03:40:58.016 --> 03:41:02.700]  They used an exchange-traded fund, which was making negative bets against bank stocks.
[03:41:02.700 --> 03:41:06.884]  So those congressmen were actually making money as those bank stocks were collapsing.
[03:41:07.544 --> 03:41:12.485]  So these guys are just fully invested in the collapse, and that's why I call them suicide bankers.
[03:41:12.485 --> 03:41:24.027]  Because they have a fundamentalist belief in capitalism as their religion, and they're willing to blow themselves up in the name of their religious belief in fanatical capitalism.
[03:41:24.027 --> 03:41:33.149]  Today, before I forget, Meredith Whitney, who's a very popular analyst now, she's the one who called out Citibank a few years ago, right before the crash.
[03:41:33.149 --> 03:41:36.170]  She said this, quote, financial reform
[03:41:37.355 --> 03:41:43.799]  Will cause, quote, tragic unemployment levels for an extended period of time.
[03:41:43.799 --> 03:41:46.460]  You see what she's saying?
[03:41:46.460 --> 03:41:53.164]  If you try to reform us, then unemployment levels will be tragic for an extended period of time.
[03:41:53.164 --> 03:41:54.725]  That's an outright threat!
[03:41:54.725 --> 03:41:57.327]  That's just an outright threat coming from Wall Street.
[03:41:57.327 --> 03:42:00.468]  If you try to reform us, you're never going to get a job again.
[03:42:00.468 --> 03:42:04.050]  You know, that's just outright tyranny, I mean.
[03:42:04.050 --> 03:42:04.911]  What else can you call it?
[03:42:05.782 --> 03:42:07.303]  You're absolutely right.
[03:42:07.303 --> 03:42:10.205]  Well said, Max Keiser, and they just continue to threaten.
[03:42:10.205 --> 03:42:11.666]  Let's talk to Tom in Connecticut.
[03:42:11.666 --> 03:42:12.326]  You're on the air.
[03:42:12.326 --> 03:42:16.769]  Hi, yeah, this is perfect what you're talking about.
[03:42:16.769 --> 03:42:19.591]  I did want to comment on something you said yesterday, Alex.
[03:42:20.419 --> 03:42:32.445]  And that was, you said that it was good that they were arresting the bankers in Iceland, but then you said it's okay, you know, we have the great local bankers down the street where you can get a loan for a car.
[03:42:32.445 --> 03:42:43.291]  But private bankers are private bankers are private banker no matter how small they are, how big they are, they have the power through factional reserve lending to create money out of nothing.
[03:42:43.291 --> 03:42:45.712]  And what we need is a public
[03:42:47.373 --> 03:42:52.356]  Well, let me say this.
[03:42:52.356 --> 03:42:54.438]  I mean, I'm all for state banks.
[03:42:54.438 --> 03:42:56.039]  But that's still a bank.
[03:42:56.039 --> 03:42:59.582]  And it's not going to be able to compete if it doesn't have the fractional system.
[03:42:59.582 --> 03:43:01.743]  And this is a very complex issue.
[03:43:01.743 --> 03:43:04.245]  But local banks, some are good, some are bad.
[03:43:04.245 --> 03:43:11.750]  The point is, we don't want the mega six banks in the U.S., several others globally, but there's no more than ten, any way you slice it.
[03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:14.753]  So just for simplicity, we don't want the mega ten banks.
[03:43:15.433 --> 03:43:20.497]  To have the regulatory power to scoop up the smaller banks, because then we're really in trouble.
[03:43:20.497 --> 03:43:22.458]  Max Keiser.
[03:43:22.458 --> 03:43:31.785]  In North Dakota, they have a banking system which is sound, because they passed some laws to get rid of a lot of the abuses.
[03:43:31.785 --> 03:43:36.109]  And Ellen Brown, who's a very fine journalist, has done a lot of work.
[03:43:36.109 --> 03:43:40.192]  If you type in Ellen Brown in the search engine, and search North Dakota banks,
[03:43:40.812 --> 03:43:59.361]  It is possible to run banks in an equitable, fair way and North Dakota, surprisingly, people probably don't know about this, they actually have some pretty decent banks because they have decided to not try to run with the wolves and to simply get in the very simple business of
[03:43:59.821 --> 03:44:01.902]  But it's the same thing with Texas banks.
[03:44:01.902 --> 03:44:04.063]  They're some of the wealthiest in the country.
[03:44:04.063 --> 03:44:08.525]  And the Texas Banking Association has come out and said, we're not selling derivatives.
[03:44:08.525 --> 03:44:09.966]  We're not the big mega banks.
[03:44:09.966 --> 03:44:11.287]  They are dangerous.
[03:44:11.287 --> 03:44:18.450]  And so that's important to be friendly with regional banks to be able to defeat the big banks.
[03:44:18.450 --> 03:44:23.472]  And then later, if we want to change something at that level and fix abuses at the local level, I think it's great.
[03:44:23.472 --> 03:44:24.393]  But Tom, finish your point.
[03:44:25.253 --> 03:44:31.597]  Yeah, well, that is excellent that Max brought up Ellen Brown in her book, The Web of Debt, in the Bank of North Dakota.
[03:44:31.597 --> 03:44:35.000]  No, the Bank of North Dakota is a state-owned and operated bank.
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:37.261]  It is true sovereign money.
[03:44:37.261 --> 03:44:44.606]  We need a sovereign monetary system, not a private debt money system, what we have now, where they have the power to create money.
[03:44:44.606 --> 03:44:46.027]  They are like a mafia.
[03:44:46.027 --> 03:44:55.213]  We have to realize that the private bankers of the world are like a global mafia, and we have to stand up to them like the people of a village stand up to the mafia and run them out of town.
[03:44:55.233 --> 03:44:56.334]  I agree.
[03:44:56.334 --> 03:44:57.635]  Tom, well said.
[03:44:57.635 --> 03:44:58.636]  Absolutely.
[03:44:58.636 --> 03:45:03.681]  Currency should be a symbol of exchange, not the actual energy.
[03:45:03.681 --> 03:45:04.862]  It doesn't have the value.
[03:45:04.862 --> 03:45:07.965]  It's an agreed upon mode of exchange.
[03:45:07.965 --> 03:45:10.307]  And we need to get back to what we had pre-1913.
[03:45:10.307 --> 03:45:12.990]  Let's talk to Rachel in New York.
[03:45:12.990 --> 03:45:13.531]  You're on the air.
[03:45:14.936 --> 03:45:26.531]  Hi, I just wanted to let you know that one of the things that has been going on lately that is not being reported is that many people up here in New York on Wall Street are withdrawing their 401k's.
[03:45:29.005 --> 03:45:31.987]  Actually, I have seen that in the news.
[03:45:31.987 --> 03:45:43.092]  The word is getting out, but it's not a big national story because of Bloomberg and other reports that the federal government is ordering private pension funds to, quote, invest in failed banks.
[03:45:43.092 --> 03:45:48.475]  I mean, since when can the government order because they have regulatory threats if they don't?
[03:45:48.475 --> 03:45:50.436]  See, they can selectively enforce.
[03:45:50.436 --> 03:45:51.617]  Max Keiser, break that down.
[03:45:52.734 --> 03:45:52.994]  Right.
[03:45:52.994 --> 03:45:55.697]  Well, 401k accounts are the retirement accounts.
[03:45:55.697 --> 03:45:58.099]  People squirrel away money every month with their employer.
[03:45:58.099 --> 03:46:20.918]  Now, if they're liquidating those accounts, what's not being clear here is either it's because of duress and they need that money because they're going bankrupt and they have to draw down on their savings, or two, they fear tax hikes coming and the tax advantages of the 401k evaporate, so why not take that money out and put it somewhere in another institution that you don't have the same kind of risk?
[03:46:21.338 --> 03:46:44.483]  Now, I think what the caller is referring to is that people are removing money from their 401Ks as an offensive measure, not a defensive measure, as a way to understand that they need to take more control of their financial well-being and to put what they thought was money safely put away into other alternative investments, possibly other currencies, other countries, into gold, etc.
[03:46:46.178 --> 03:46:47.939]  Well said, Max Keiser.
[03:46:47.939 --> 03:46:49.599]  Anything else, Rachel?
[03:46:49.599 --> 03:46:50.100]  No, that's all.
[03:46:50.100 --> 03:46:58.243]  I just wanted to say many of the people we're speaking to say they'd rather have their money now than wait until they're 58 years old when it won't be there anymore.
[03:46:58.243 --> 03:47:00.384]  They'll take the tax hit now.
[03:47:00.384 --> 03:47:00.764]  Yeah, I know.
[03:47:00.764 --> 03:47:01.745]  That's accelerating.
[03:47:01.745 --> 03:47:02.625]  Good point.
[03:47:02.625 --> 03:47:05.846]  Let's talk to Stephen in California.
[03:47:05.846 --> 03:47:07.547]  You're on the air.
[03:47:07.547 --> 03:47:08.407]  Mr. Jones?
[03:47:08.407 --> 03:47:10.028]  Yes, sir.
[03:47:10.028 --> 03:47:10.868]  Pleasure to be on your show.
[03:47:10.868 --> 03:47:13.369]  I'm a first-time caller and kind of a first-time listener.
[03:47:14.995 --> 03:47:23.863]  As a young person living in today, I become educated on your show and you instill the passion slash interest in government.
[03:47:23.863 --> 03:47:30.988]  And I was wondering, you know, how a person in my position, my family has no legacy and all that, how do I get into that sort of thing?
[03:47:30.988 --> 03:47:36.133]  Well, look, in high school, in college, they make it boring, it's government, it's like
[03:47:38.271 --> 03:47:42.475]  Alcatraz or something, or it's like some, you know, island of Dr. Maru.
[03:47:42.475 --> 03:47:45.118]  It's some imaginary thing far off.
[03:47:45.118 --> 03:47:55.909]  You've got to be involved in government, because if you don't, it's going to get taken over by shysters, and they're going to rob the hell out of you, and hire a bunch of uniformed thugs to enforce their corruption.
[03:47:55.909 --> 03:47:56.710]  It's called tyranny!
[03:47:57.310 --> 03:48:07.235]  And so we've became the wealthiest country in the world because we had a small government and we were on top of things and we allowed people to keep most their wealth because it was their God-given right.
[03:48:07.235 --> 03:48:20.442]  Now we're becoming the center of evil because our wealth has been used to dominate the globe and build an empire and no one is as enslaved as people inside the empire and so people are waking up and deciding I better get involved in government.
[03:48:20.442 --> 03:48:22.744]  Then they go get involved in government and they find
[03:48:23.504 --> 03:48:30.531]  That for those that did get involved, there's a fake left-right choice, which is meant to further confuse them, okay?
[03:48:30.531 --> 03:48:46.828]  They've followed the yellow brick road, they've gotten to the Emerald Palace, they've gone in and there's this big flaming head telling them, I am a great Oz, and the next level is going, no Republicans and Democrats, you're not, Toto pulls the curtain back,
[03:48:47.168 --> 03:48:53.712]  Well, if you go back, this is a very interesting question because it's a very interesting inflection point and especially for a young person.
[03:48:53.712 --> 03:48:54.273]  Now, if you remember,
[03:49:13.047 --> 03:49:23.994]  Ronald Reagan said, government is the problem, and he said this under the influence of thinkers like Milton Friedman, who believed that the market could solve all problems.
[03:49:23.994 --> 03:49:33.600]  Now in 2010, people are saying, you know what, the market is actually the problem, and it's creating an incredible amount of problems, on top of problems.
[03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:35.201]  So if that's true, then
[03:49:36.221 --> 03:49:44.944]  Does that mean we're going to ask ourselves or look at the possibility that there might be some saving grace in the idea of having a government?
[03:49:44.944 --> 03:49:46.344]  But here's the next problem, Max.
[03:49:46.344 --> 03:49:46.824]  Let me comment.
[03:49:46.824 --> 03:49:49.585]  The fathers of the United States created a government.
[03:49:49.585 --> 03:49:51.486]  That's what they got this country started on.
[03:49:51.486 --> 03:49:53.066]  They didn't start with a hedge fund.
[03:49:53.066 --> 03:49:54.347]  They started with a constitution.
[03:49:54.813 --> 03:50:03.956]  No, I agree with you, but again, to expand on that, under the Constitution, Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit, not private bankers.
[03:50:03.956 --> 03:50:05.997]  So the confusion is going to be with the public.
[03:50:05.997 --> 03:50:12.839]  You're going to have the private bankers pose as the solution with a type of regulation that is only going to empower them even more.
[03:50:12.839 --> 03:50:14.040]  So, how do you get past that?
[03:50:14.440 --> 03:50:27.232]  Well, first of all, my question is, there's a lot of rhetoric, and especially in the libertarian camp, that government has nothing to offer, and I think that that is a self-defeating position.
[03:50:27.232 --> 03:50:33.317]  There has to be some role of government, first of all, so government does not become a dirty word.
[03:50:33.317 --> 03:50:34.238]  There is a role for
[03:50:34.678 --> 03:50:35.699]  That's step number one.
[03:50:35.699 --> 03:50:39.540]  Step number two is, as you say, yeah, well, it's all in the Constitution.
[03:50:39.540 --> 03:50:44.702]  They recognize gold and silver as the only constitutionally recognized form of money and currency.
[03:50:44.702 --> 03:50:52.205]  If that's true, then all of the fiat currency, fractional reserve, derivative market scamming that's going on has to be taken completely out of the Constitution.
[03:50:52.205 --> 03:50:54.406]  Yeah, we've got to go back to the Constitution.
[03:50:54.406 --> 03:50:55.006]  That's right.
[03:50:55.006 --> 03:50:55.506]  Stay there.
[03:50:55.506 --> 03:50:55.806]  Stay there.
[03:50:55.806 --> 03:50:58.927]  We're going to talk to Ian, Steve, Kevin, and others.
[03:50:58.927 --> 03:51:00.448]  And, Stephen, I'm going to try to answer your question.
[03:51:02.372 --> 03:51:05.396]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:51:05.396 --> 03:51:10.723]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:51:10.723 --> 03:51:12.766]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:51:12.766 --> 03:51:17.312]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:51:17.312 --> 03:51:17.852]  I don't know.
[03:51:38.166 --> 03:51:38.406]  We're good.
[03:52:03.597 --> 03:52:06.099]  And you're subject to public police action.
[03:52:06.099 --> 03:52:07.360]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:07.360 --> 03:52:11.123]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:11.123 --> 03:52:13.525]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.525 --> 03:52:18.929]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.389 --> 03:52:26.056]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:26.056 --> 03:52:32.043]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:32.043 --> 03:52:35.747]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:52:36.207 --> 03:52:40.491]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:40.491 --> 03:52:46.457]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:46.457 --> 03:52:50.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:51.982]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:51.982 --> 03:52:53.103]  It's here.

[03:53:54.188 --> 03:53:54.408]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:53:54.408 --> 03:53:56.709]  What if I say I'm not one of your slaves?
[03:53:56.709 --> 03:53:57.770]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[03:54:14.983 --> 03:54:17.345]  We're going to continue with calls in this segment and the next.
[03:54:17.345 --> 03:54:22.228]  And then, Gary Francium, Restore the Republic, with Don't Tread on Me is coming on.
[03:54:22.228 --> 03:54:27.952]  I want to play Miss Arizona, or Miss Oklahoma, talking about Arizona.
[03:54:27.952 --> 03:54:29.574]  Says she supports Arizona law.
[03:54:29.574 --> 03:54:32.496]  We're going to talk about states' rights coming up.
[03:54:33.749 --> 03:54:40.293]  But before I go any further with Max Keiser, I want to simplify this because this gets confusing for people because it is so simple.
[03:54:40.293 --> 03:54:42.595]  Sometimes the simplest things are confusing.
[03:54:42.595 --> 03:54:55.223]  I'm against anything big and monolithic, whether it's government or hedge funds that are bigger than any government, money-wise, because they just created themselves, as Thomas Jefferson warned they would, a blank check to take over the planet.
[03:54:55.223 --> 03:54:56.744]  You know, to paraphrase Jefferson, he said,
[03:54:57.304 --> 03:55:05.145]  Yeah, you could take out private central bankers, but if you ever let them back in within one day, they'll buy up the whole world with fake credit they produce.
[03:55:05.145 --> 03:55:05.305]  So...
[03:55:06.297 --> 03:55:18.425]  The problem is with a quote free market is it's not free market when the CIA with a inner coterie of private banks gives themselves unlimited trillions and uses their own regulatory power to shut down their competition.
[03:55:18.425 --> 03:55:26.189]  And so we need government to protect the true free market and to have rules against counterfeiting as Max Keiser said.
[03:55:26.189 --> 03:55:27.550]  Counterfeiting is illegal.
[03:55:27.550 --> 03:55:33.494]  If I opened up a fake company, started selling stock, claiming it was in gold mines I didn't own, it would be a fraud.
[03:55:33.934 --> 03:55:43.518]  Well, it's a step past that, with the fractional reserve banking, with the derivatives, with these fake insurance companies certifying it, and then taxpayers having to bail it out.
[03:55:43.518 --> 03:55:45.378]  So, that is the issue.
[03:55:45.378 --> 03:55:51.781]  The, quote, free market's being demonized by the bankers themselves, because they want a global controlled market that they control.
[03:55:51.781 --> 03:55:54.582]  And so, it's... until the public becomes educated on this...
[03:55:55.422 --> 03:55:56.663]  It's just going to get worse.
[03:55:56.663 --> 03:55:58.885]  Again, MaxKaiser.com is his website.
[03:55:58.885 --> 03:55:59.806]  Very informative stuff.
[03:55:59.806 --> 03:56:08.474]  You can watch him on RT, as well as Press TV does weekly television shows that are some of the most popular on those channels.
[03:56:08.474 --> 03:56:12.298]  But let's go back to your phone calls.
[03:56:12.298 --> 03:56:15.981]  Briefly answering Steve's question, Steven, I don't know how you get involved, quote, in government.
[03:56:16.181 --> 03:56:23.128]  Start fighting tyranny, form your own group, go to city council, speak out, start a blog, and you'll learn and get better as you go.
[03:56:23.128 --> 03:56:28.413]  Ian in England, you're on the air with questions for Max Keiser.
[03:56:28.413 --> 03:56:29.674]  Hi there.
[03:56:29.674 --> 03:56:33.397]  Hello all beyond, this is Airstrip 2 calling, over, go ahead.
[03:56:33.397 --> 03:56:36.140]  How are you doing Alex?
[03:56:36.140 --> 03:56:36.360]  Good.
[03:56:37.755 --> 03:56:38.975]  Good to be on.
[03:56:38.975 --> 03:56:40.736]  Yeah, it's good to hear Max Kaiser.
[03:56:40.736 --> 03:56:47.198]  I've always been an interested listener to his opinions, and of course your own.
[03:56:47.198 --> 03:57:00.562]  With regards to the British parliamentary catastrophe that's been going on, I mean, people think that they can't make a difference, but we've demonstrated that we've effectively created a constitutional crisis here.
[03:57:00.562 --> 03:57:04.643]  There was nobody who was willing to back up the parliamentary process.
[03:57:05.836 --> 03:57:13.960]  And I think that that's certainly a statement which people can take a little bit of pleasure from, if not a great deal of influence from.
[03:57:13.960 --> 03:57:22.425]  So, it demonstrates the fact that these people don't have any kind of mandate to operate the way they have been doing.
[03:57:22.425 --> 03:57:24.586]  That's right, all three of the big parties are hated.
[03:57:24.586 --> 03:57:26.327]  Your take on what's happening in England, Max?
[03:57:27.302 --> 03:57:28.083]  Yeah, they did.
[03:57:28.083 --> 03:57:33.227]  They triggered a crisis, a constitutional crisis, as your caller calls it.
[03:57:33.227 --> 03:57:47.517]  And because in the UK, they've become very adept at strategic voting, so everybody on the web kind of shares information to try to swing local elections in a strategic way.
[03:57:47.517 --> 03:57:51.961]  So they might vote for somebody they don't really want, if it's strategic, toward a bigger goal.
[03:57:52.601 --> 03:57:54.903]  And the people have really organized themselves in this way.
[03:57:54.903 --> 03:58:04.850]  Now it's interesting, when the new coalition started, this Tory-Liberal-Democrat coalition, it was very interesting because they were the coalition government, they didn't have a majority.
[03:58:04.850 --> 03:58:10.214]  They had a problem because in the House of Lords they didn't have enough Lords to back up their proposals.
[03:58:10.214 --> 03:58:16.358]  So what they did yesterday is they simply, with a stroke of a pen, increased the number of Lords in the House of Lords by 100.
[03:58:17.459 --> 03:58:21.123]  Now, for anyone in the U.S., that would send a chill down your spine.
[03:58:21.123 --> 03:58:27.829]  Because, of course, we fought a war to get rid of... to get rid... to, you know, escape the Lords in the House of Lords.
[03:58:27.829 --> 03:58:31.493]  But they're still active, and they're still part of a major government, the U.S.
[03:58:31.493 --> 03:58:31.913]  ally.
[03:58:31.913 --> 03:58:36.418]  That's where the Bank of England was established in 1694, which is... Plus, they're not hereditary Lords.
[03:58:36.418 --> 03:58:37.439]  They're not hereditary.
[03:58:37.439 --> 03:58:38.860]  Five more minutes with Max Geyser.
