[00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:10.280]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.881]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.421]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:17.603]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.603 --> 00:00:21.705]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:30.416]  It is Wednesday, the 20th day of October 2010.
[00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:34.219]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:44.588]  In hour number three and four, one of the leading experts out there on the full spectrum mortgage fraud and what it means not just to the United States, but the entire globe.
[00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:48.331]  What it means to confidence, common law, private property.
[00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:54.676]  Randy Kelton will be joining us in studio in the third and fourth hour today as we go into overdrive.
[00:00:56.218 --> 00:01:00.662]  You know, I've been talking a lot in the last few years about Pentagon's admitted plans.
[00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:16.017]  We knew about it, of course, before it was public and talked about it because of the secret training we were able to infiltrate and cover back in the mid and late 1990s that there was a program and an operation to shut down our economy, bring us to our knees financially to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:22.523]  And of course the China, the biggest holder of debt, the Federal Reserve, the second largest holder of debt.
[00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:29.548]  You gotta love it, they're engineering the financial system in a collapse and they hold the second amount, largest amount of our debt.
[00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:39.956]  That they were preparing the society for full military occupation in the name of quelling social unrest that they had on record engineered the
[00:01:41.357 --> 00:01:49.022]  Sociological, financial, national, global climate to induce civil unrest.
[00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:51.043]  And we wrote a story yesterday.
[00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:54.065]  I saw the story by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:54.065 --> 00:02:00.009]  I mentioned it on air and I sent Paul an IM and I said, this is the type of story the Drudge Report will pick up.
[00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.910]  And it's not just getting picked up by the Drudge Report.
[00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.973]  It's that the Drudge Report is a bellwether of what other media is going to pay attention to.
[00:02:06.673 --> 00:02:14.863]  And no sooner had we put that article out, and the previous articles last week about this, will Americans follow French example of mass civil unrest?
[00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:20.089]  The Drudge Report picked it up yesterday and today, and guess what came out this morning?
[00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:24.274]  Time Magazine, will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war?
[00:02:26.778 --> 00:02:28.559]  And here's our newest story out on today.
[00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.082]  Time Magazine, prospect of civil war in U.S.
[00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:34.924]  doesn't seem that far-fetched.
[00:02:34.924 --> 00:02:36.946]  Meanwhile, rioters rampage.
[00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:44.111]  Protesters block French airports as day number eight now accelerates and Sarkozy begs for calm.
[00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:45.953]  Here's the London Guardian headline.
[00:02:45.953 --> 00:02:50.997]  Nicholas Sarkozy calls for calm as French pension protests gather pace.
[00:02:52.383 --> 00:03:01.066]  Cars burned, shop windows smashed, as 4,000 petrol stations awaiting supplies on 6th day of French protest.
[00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:01.886]  They say the 6th day.
[00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:04.246]  It's actually day 8 or 9, depending on how you look at it.
[00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:07.727]  But I guess day 6 or 7 of shutting down the gas stations.
[00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:16.370]  Overall, the millions of people taken to the streets from Spain to Greece to, of course, the epicenter, Paris, and all over France, has been going on for about a month.
[00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.751]  As they're told, we're raising your taxes, cutting your pension funds, and raising retirement age.
[00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:27.792]  And the French, you can say what you want about them, because it's a national sport to bash them and make fun of them.
[00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:39.634]  But the French have said, look, we paid into this socialist system, and they know the vast majority of their tax money now goes to service on debt, not to actual services.
[00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:42.155]  And they understand the banks are a bunch of fraudsters.
[00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.555]  And this was all done by design.
[00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:47.998]  Uh, and so, uh, now the question's being asked, will this happen here?
[00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:57.484]  And I've got a big stack of political news in my politics stack right here with town halls getting violent, getting feverish, people getting angry.
[00:03:57.484 --> 00:04:01.366]  Uh, Democrats are in all out retreat right now.
[00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:06.650]  There's a ridiculous headline that Nancy Pelosi isn't going to seek the speakership next year.
[00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.431]  Well, of course she's not going to run for speaker.
[00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:10.332]  The Democrats aren't going to have the House.
[00:04:10.332 --> 00:04:11.613]  That's a foregone conclusion.
[00:04:11.613 --> 00:04:14.055]  Uh, but will the Republicans get the Senate?
[00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:35.411]  The media is in a full court press to regurgitate discredited ridiculous fairy tale lies about Rand Paul and the final disinfo against him with just a week and a half or almost two weeks going into the election is fake polls put out by CBS and others not predicted this claiming oh it's now neck and neck but
[00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:40.432]  But the full index of polls show Rand Paul 7 to 15 points ahead, depending on which poll.
[00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:41.893]  7, 8 points, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:44.414]  You can find them all across that spectrum.
[00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:53.716]  But it doesn't mean he's going to win, because Kentucky, like many states, is famous for chicanery and election bamboozling by whatever party is in power.
[00:04:53.716 --> 00:04:56.577]  And of course, the guy he's running against is the Attorney General there.
[00:04:56.577 --> 00:04:57.758]  Has a lot of strings he can pull.
[00:04:57.758 --> 00:04:58.458]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:58.458 --> 00:04:58.858]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:05.118]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:06.038]  Number 1.
[00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:09.461]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:10.321]  Number 2.
[00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:15.204]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.204 --> 00:05:15.965]  It's true.
[00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:20.828]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:21.648]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.648 --> 00:05:25.251]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:28.933]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:29.933]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:32.694]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:36.376]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:37.176]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.176 --> 00:05:41.318]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.318 --> 00:05:46.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:11.066]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:18.452]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:18.452 --> 00:06:23.336]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:08:00.774 --> 00:08:06.135]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.135 --> 00:08:08.436]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:14.414 --> 00:08:15.135]  We are live.
[00:08:15.135 --> 00:08:18.039]  It is Wednesday, the 20th day of October 2010.
[00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:27.511]  We're going to go over the political news, the economic news, the rioting going on all over the Western world.
[00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:32.638]  The mainstream corporate media here saying, is it coming to the shores of the United States?
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.582]  Will Americans get mad at having their pension funds taken and taxed?
[00:08:37.582 --> 00:08:40.944]  Will they get mad at their dollar being devalued?
[00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:45.007]  That is all coming up, and I wanna just go ahead now and throw the toll-free number out.
[00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:47.809]  We're gonna take a lot of calls throughout the full four hours today.
[00:08:47.809 --> 00:08:50.150]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the air.
[00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.791]  I particularly wanna hear from military,
[00:09:00.356 --> 00:09:06.238]  And police currently who are serving police officers or military or veterans.
[00:09:06.238 --> 00:09:11.159]  I know there's been military training going back 100 years for riot control.
[00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:16.480]  We know about the bonus strikers in front of the White House from World War One wanting to get their bonus money.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.342]  They were promised under law being ridden down by Patton and MacArthur when they were young colonels.
[00:09:22.342 --> 00:09:23.442]  They got promoted for that.
[00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:36.910]  But this is a systemic, creeping death, a quiet, covert operation of massive scale to take over every town and city and to take over every local government, and that is now publicly admitted.
[00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:48.778]  We were able to decipher the intelligence information we had back in the mid-1990s and correctly forecast exactly what we're facing, not just what the military is being trained to do and openly being announced now,
[00:09:49.198 --> 00:09:58.229]  But what the cause and the cover trigger for that would be a banking crisis engineered by the globalists.
[00:09:58.229 --> 00:10:02.875]  And so here we are today and it's now getting a lot of attention.
[00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:03.676]  I told you last week
[00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:23.233]  How the reports in local news around the country that we boiled down and put in a PrisonPlanet.com article got a lot of attention, nationally and even locally, because reporters and talk show hosts could just read Paul Watson's article and see where the Army admitted they're preparing to take over every town and city during the economic collapse.
[00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:35.937]  And in the latest articles written by Paul Watson, we have links to the Army's own memorandum where they believe there is going to be a total collapse, but of course they don't point out that their banker masters are the ones that engineered it.
[00:10:35.937 --> 00:10:41.959]  The Drudge Report, of course, picked up our Will Americans Follow French example of mass civil unrest.
[00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:48.502]  Yesterday and today, Time Magazine headline, Will the Federal Reserve Cause a Civil War?
[00:10:49.844 --> 00:10:49.904]  Yes.
[00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:12.361]  Unbelievably off the chart, naked banking mortgage fraud by the Big Six.
[00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:20.889]  Any small bank trying to engage in this fraud, of course, their directors are hauled up before a federal grand jury and they're sent to prison.
[00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:27.375]  But that is not the case by the big megabanks that have engineered this situation.
[00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:34.899]  We'll also be looking at the latest developments headed into the November election, less than two weeks away as well.
[00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:40.882]  So let's go ahead and get into that right now, then we'll open the phones up on this subject and a lot more.
[00:11:40.882 --> 00:11:42.663]  Here we go.
[00:11:42.663 --> 00:11:50.387]  Will Americans follow French example of mass civil unrest, or will the sleeping middle class continue
[00:11:51.874 --> 00:11:57.178]  to scratch their hind ends and watch Dancing with the Stars.
[00:11:57.178 --> 00:12:03.002]  That's a nice headline by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:12:03.002 --> 00:12:07.024]  I shouldn't laugh about this.
[00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:09.566]  Watson has a little penchant for throwing things in like that.
[00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:10.307]  I've told him not to.
[00:12:12.301 --> 00:12:14.803]  Judge Report's picking it up, he must know what he's doing.
[00:12:14.803 --> 00:12:20.047]  Time Magazine is a related story, posted up in the top of the article.
[00:12:20.047 --> 00:12:23.570]  Time Magazine, prospect of civil war in U.S.
[00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.872]  doesn't seem that far-fetched.
[00:12:26.872 --> 00:12:28.393]  That's our newest article on it.
[00:12:28.393 --> 00:12:37.140]  How will Americans react when the government begins to impose the same austerity measures that are causing riots, street battles, fuel blockades, and other assorted chaos in France?
[00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:47.363]  Will we witness mass civil unrest or will the sleeping middle class continue to watch Dancing with the Stars?
[00:12:48.672 --> 00:13:15.500]  It goes on, back in June we forecast that the imminent onset of so-called austerity measures, which in reality represent nothing more than an elevated phase of government-run looting on the taxpayer, would herald an age of rage, leading to riots and revolutions as people react with fury in response to their jobs, savings, basic public services, pensions and welfare money being seized by financial terrorists who caused the economic collapse in the first place.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.701]  That's what we forecast in June.
[00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:36.983]  Four months later, and citizens of one of the most prosperous countries in the world, with the highest standard of living, have shut down France, after six plus days of strikes and protests, in response to the government plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62, and the full state pension age from 65 to 67.
[00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:42.087]  And if they get away with that, they'll raise it to 75, as Boehner was proposing last week.
[00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.009]  John Boehner of Michigan.
[00:13:45.675 --> 00:13:48.837]  Undoubtedly, there are two different protests occurring in France.
[00:13:48.837 --> 00:14:01.625]  The more violent scenes are the work of Renamob anarchist youths, who could care less about pensions, but will waste no opportunity to don black hoods and pointlessly smash up shop windows in demonstrations against capitalism.
[00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.387]  Of course, they caught them last year in Greece.
[00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:08.530]  Mainstream news admitted the police dressed up like anarchists knocking out shop windows to make the protesters look bad.
[00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.871]  But we ought to pull that back up.
[00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:11.252]  Watson ought to add that to this article.
[00:14:12.369 --> 00:14:22.071]  Well, in reality, government seizure of pensions has all the hallmarks of a command-and-control socialism and nothing to do with true free market capitalism.
[00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:34.354]  Three youths, or these youths, are also more concerned about their welfare checks being cut, but they won't garner sympathy of the rest of the French people by taking baseball bats to Starbucks forecourts.
[00:14:35.729 --> 00:14:54.164]  In mocked up media stunts, the legitimate protests and the ones that are generally hurt by the establishment and put the idiot anarchists to shame are being run by French workers, truck drivers and union leaders and enjoy the support of around 70 percent, some polls say 80 plus percent, of the population.
[00:14:54.164 --> 00:15:01.290]  Over a thousand gas stations have now run out of fuel across France, with strategic reserves set to run out in just a few weeks.
[00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.412]  Flights and trains have been disrupted.
[00:15:03.412 --> 00:15:06.434]  Organized slowdowns have snarled highway traffic.
[00:15:06.434 --> 00:15:09.296]  The French are showing Americans how it should be done.
[00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:12.799]  But uniting peacefully to shut down an entire country.
[00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:14.721]  This is genuine people power.
[00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:20.946]  The French are sending a message to the establishment that they will no longer play ball until the looting stops.
[00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.471]  And it continues.
[00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:29.054]  Will the rent-a-mob anarchists stage similar violent riots in America?
[00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:34.980]  Or will the middle class embrace a much more legitimate backlash in the same vein of the union protesters in France?
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.805]  Will the Obama administration set to seize 401k pensions and turn them over to the Social Security Administration?
[00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:48.812]  How long will it be before Americans stir from their slumber and realize that their economic future and also that of their children is in immediate peril?
[00:15:49.392 --> 00:15:58.054]  When will Americans begin to understand that the onset of another government bailout in the form of quantitative easing 2 represents the biggest bank robbery in history?
[00:15:58.054 --> 00:16:05.956]  Just how distracted, dumbed down, fat, lazy has the American middle class become to prevent them from realizing a threat when they see it?
[00:16:05.956 --> 00:16:16.678]  British historian Simon Scama predicts not only will widespread civil unrest in America, but even a potential revolution if the elite allow the situation to spiral out of control.
[00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:35.716]  He notes that Obama will have to ditch misplaced obligations of civility and become an authoritarian enforcer in order to emerge successfully against the rising tide of constitutionalist rage that will be directed against the coming austerity fascism.
[00:16:35.716 --> 00:16:37.097]  And it continues here.
[00:16:38.371 --> 00:16:50.243]  As we documented in our article, the kind of public spending cuts, tax increases, salary caps, and retirement crackdowns that are now about to be implemented outstrip anything we've witnessed before in modern history.
[00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:51.784]  A lot of it's already been implemented, actually.
[00:16:52.805 --> 00:17:03.692]  If the American middle class reacts to the total banker takeover by collectively scratching their hind ends and flipping the TV channel, the country as we know it is probably gone for good.
[00:17:03.692 --> 00:17:17.001]  However, if Americans follow the example of the French and send a clear signal to the elite that they will refuse to participate in rigged game, the true revolution that will restore both political and economic freedom and prosperity will be set in motion.
[00:17:19.363 --> 00:17:24.809]  Will Americans buying silver to protect their savings and guns to protect themselves in record numbers?
[00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:40.766]  It seems that the message is at least getting through to some of the people, but until we see mass walkouts, blockades, and other acts of nonviolent mass protest, disobedience, the establishment will continue to move forward with an onslaught after onslaught of financial pillaging.
[00:17:41.306 --> 00:17:49.577]  Numerous forecasters, governments, spy agencies and international bodies are predicting mass riots and unrest in response to the worsening economic picture.
[00:17:49.577 --> 00:17:54.243]  In November of 2008, right as the economic implosion was unraveling, the U.S.
[00:17:54.243 --> 00:17:56.045]  Army War College released a white paper
[00:17:56.946 --> 00:17:57.707]  Yes, unforeseen.
[00:17:57.707 --> 00:17:59.469]  Their bosses engineered it.
[00:18:13.444 --> 00:18:23.076]  Purposefully domestic resistance, purposeful domestic resistance, pervasive public health emergencies, or loss of functioning political and legal order.
[00:18:23.076 --> 00:18:29.123]  The widespread civil disobedience, the document said, would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities.
[00:18:30.154 --> 00:18:30.434]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:50.905 --> 00:19:17.814]  It goes on, a British Ministry of Defence report struck a similar tone when it predicted, this was three years ago, that within 30 years the growing gap between the rich and the middle class along with the urban underclass threatening social order would mean the world's middle class might unite using access to knowledge, resources and skills to shape transnational process in their own class interest and in the classes could become a revolutionary class.
[00:19:18.976 --> 00:19:22.158]  Again, the middle class could become a revolutionary class.
[00:19:22.158 --> 00:19:24.500]  And then we have some videos posted under that.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.082]  Now, that's Watson's article about it yesterday.
[00:19:28.082 --> 00:19:33.986]  Here is Time Magazine today, and we're going to cover this when we come back.
[00:19:33.986 --> 00:19:37.309]  Will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war?
[00:19:38.564 --> 00:19:42.226]  Will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war?
[00:19:42.226 --> 00:19:52.030]  And then an even more detailed article than what Paul wrote yesterday, dealing with this latest headline, Time Magazine, prospect of civil war in U.S.
[00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.891]  doesn't seem that far-fetched.
[00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:56.632]  This is a very complex issue.
[00:19:56.632 --> 00:19:59.393]  We're going to break it down on the other side, but they're getting us ready for it.
[00:20:00.982 --> 00:20:10.507]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how heart and body extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:20:10.507 --> 00:20:11.807]  My name is Crystal.
[00:20:11.807 --> 00:20:14.749]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:18.711]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:20:18.711 --> 00:20:22.693]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:20:22.853 --> 00:20:23.694]  What did Crystal do?
[00:20:23.694 --> 00:20:27.639]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:20:27.639 --> 00:20:34.066]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.

[00:21:13.332 --> 00:21:18.634]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[00:21:18.634 --> 00:21:21.636]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.381]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:35.944]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.944 --> 00:21:41.748]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.748 --> 00:21:45.390]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.212]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.212 --> 00:21:53.155]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:21:53.155 --> 00:21:53.496]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.496 --> 00:21:54.817]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:01.841]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:01.841 --> 00:22:07.366]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:07.366 --> 00:22:07.906]  I get it.
[00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:17.533]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:17.533 --> 00:22:18.954]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:18.954 --> 00:22:27.421]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:28.662]  If all looks rosy to you,
[00:22:28.882 --> 00:22:30.803]  Then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:30.803 --> 00:22:35.066]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:36.667]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:40.630]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.453]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:44.453 --> 00:22:45.354]  You should too.
[00:22:45.354 --> 00:22:46.494]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:46.494 --> 00:22:49.817]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:49.817 --> 00:22:49.877]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.877 --> 00:22:50.217]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.217 --> 00:22:50.397]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.983 --> 00:23:03.604]  Soon we'll be shutting our doors and windows, shutting out fresh air for months.
[00:23:03.604 --> 00:23:08.505]  Did you know you're also keeping in allergens, bacteria, and germs that cause colds and flu?
[00:23:08.505 --> 00:23:12.245]  What if there was a low-cost way of blanketing your home with clean air?
[00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:13.105]  There is!
[00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:16.286]  Introducing the AeroAces 3000 Air Purifier.
[00:23:16.286 --> 00:23:24.047]  It utilizes new patent-pending nanotechnology, producing a blanket of oxidizers that cleans the air and sanitizes the surfaces.
[00:23:24.047 --> 00:23:27.548]  Imagine not spreading the cold or flu bug to everyone around you.
[00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:31.352]  AeroAces 3000 air purifiers are made in the USA.

[00:24:04.394 --> 00:24:05.295]  We're back live.
[00:24:05.295 --> 00:24:07.998]  Paul Watson has another story on today.
[00:24:07.998 --> 00:24:10.280]  He's on fire at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:23.713 --> 00:24:42.907]  Shot the protest movement in the foot and that's the new government talking point and clearly we have videos of the police Not arresting the thuggish youth but going after mainline Protesters and we've caught them all over the world in Italy in Greece in Spain in England in Denver, Colorado in in
[00:24:46.872 --> 00:24:56.018]  What happened in Seattle in 99, up in Canada, in Montebello a few years ago, they just do it over and over and over again.
[00:24:56.018 --> 00:25:01.221]  So here is the headline, violent anarchists help French authorities crush pension protests.
[00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:06.665]  And this dovetails with exactly what I was about to cover.
[00:25:06.665 --> 00:25:09.186]  We know, in fact this happened to myself in 1999 when the
[00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:18.285]  Fortune 500 had their meeting in Austin, and there were clearly police dressed up like anarchists trying to start fights.
[00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:27.370]  And we identified them as police, and uniformed police ran over and basically removed them from the crowd, and I was in their face shouting at them that we knew that they were cops.
[00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.111]  And so this is how they demonize the protest.
[00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:32.253]  It's one thing to shut down the government.
[00:25:32.253 --> 00:25:37.696]  It's another thing to burn private vehicles and to knock out windows of private shops.
[00:25:37.696 --> 00:25:39.497]  In fact, guys, search the term
[00:25:41.689 --> 00:26:07.185]  Greek television, police caught smashing shops, or police caught provocateur-ing in Greece, and national television, their biggest national TV network, you know, had piece after piece, what, last year, where the police were caught dressed up, smashing out windows, smashing out car windows, setting things on fire, as a pretext
[00:26:07.785 --> 00:26:12.810]  And the evidence is clear that people affiliated with the police also shot police officers.
[00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.592]  That way you get the rest of the cops against the protesters.
[00:26:15.592 --> 00:26:27.884]  Because the last thing you want is what's happening in Greece, Spain, France, and many other nations, where the police are now joining with the protesters because they're having their pay cut, they're having their pensions stolen.
[00:26:27.884 --> 00:26:30.946]  I mean, in France, they take over 80% on average of your money.
[00:26:31.627 --> 00:26:35.710]  And so the people paid for all this socialism, but that's the scam with socialism.
[00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.132]  It always gets stolen by the elites.
[00:26:39.132 --> 00:26:44.435]  No one's going to take your paycheck and take your money for decades and then give all of it back to you.
[00:26:44.435 --> 00:26:45.916]  You'll be lucky if you get any of it back.
[00:26:45.916 --> 00:26:47.216]  Do you understand that?
[00:26:47.216 --> 00:26:48.037]  It doesn't work.
[00:26:48.037 --> 00:26:50.659]  You're better off keeping it for yourself.
[00:26:50.659 --> 00:26:52.820]  Investing it as you see fit.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.922]  But the government grows these giant welfare groups
[00:26:57.173 --> 00:27:11.219]  And then uses them as a political army to checkmate the working middle class and the nouveau riche and others to where anytime somebody wants to cut taxes or cut welfare, this mob comes out and says, don't do it.
[00:27:11.219 --> 00:27:20.203]  But remember, the media and fake conservatives always point their fingers predominantly at welfare mobs and people.
[00:27:20.203 --> 00:27:24.025]  They are a tiny part of the overall budget in every major nation.
[00:27:25.146 --> 00:27:34.732]  Upwards of two-thirds of our discretionary spending now, and of the overall tax money you pay, goes to interest on the debt.
[00:27:34.732 --> 00:27:35.993]  And who holds the debt?
[00:27:35.993 --> 00:27:42.177]  The Communist Chinese, and then number two, the private Federal Reserve that has engineered this situation.
[00:27:42.177 --> 00:27:43.598]  But here's the issue.
[00:27:43.598 --> 00:27:49.923]  We're now at the point where it's not Alex Jones 15 years ago talking about the quiet, slow preparations for martial law.
[00:27:50.743 --> 00:28:04.776]  And as I said 15 years ago, it could be next year or it could be 20 years from now, all we know is the Pentagon is admittedly federalizing everything, spying on the citizens, and getting ready for a total takeover of society and door-to-door gun confiscations.
[00:28:04.776 --> 00:28:05.917]  I've been to the drills.
[00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:07.278]  I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[00:28:07.518 --> 00:28:27.256]  I've had countless videos in Alabama and Tennessee and Maryland and Florida and Louisiana and I've been to California and I've been to South Texas and we've been to Chicago this year to cover the military with foreign troops training to put role players who play the part of Americans in FEMA camps.
[00:28:28.084 --> 00:28:29.285]  At the sports stadiums.
[00:28:29.285 --> 00:28:30.685]  Those are the relocation centers.
[00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:33.106]  They take you there and then decide where to send you.
[00:28:33.106 --> 00:28:34.107]  Jaron found the article.
[00:28:34.107 --> 00:28:35.667]  We'll put it up on screen.
[00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:38.929]  Did Greek anarchist agents provocateurs torch police?
[00:28:38.929 --> 00:28:39.369]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:28:39.369 --> 00:28:41.990]  I thought you'd found the Greek stuff.
[00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:43.111]  If you have to, call Watson.
[00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:48.754]  He's answering when you dial him on this phone with the phone number that's the first number in it.
[00:28:48.754 --> 00:28:53.976]  And because I want that for the next segment, he can find it because he wrote articles about it.
[00:28:53.976 --> 00:29:00.760]  But the search would be against something like Greek police caught vandalizing businesses and cars.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:09.304]  And then there's Greek television showing police in uniforms directing groups of people in black masks to do this.
[00:29:09.304 --> 00:29:10.785]  And it came out they were police.
[00:29:10.785 --> 00:29:12.746]  That is key to show people.
[00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:15.746]  Okay, I'm now ranting.
[00:29:15.746 --> 00:29:19.047]  The point is, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:29:19.047 --> 00:29:23.748]  When we come back from break, I'm going to get into this article and then your phone calls.
[00:29:23.748 --> 00:29:29.289]  Time Magazine, will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war?
[00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:34.550]  And we have the story that really kicked off this debate yesterday from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.511]  Will Americans follow French example of mass civil unrest?
[00:29:38.511 --> 00:29:42.772]  So why is Time Magazine hyping civil war over the private Federal Reserve?
[00:29:43.712 --> 00:29:47.338]  We'll break that down and give you my take on it and then get your take on it.
[00:29:47.338 --> 00:29:51.183]  On the other side of this quick break, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:51.183 --> 00:29:52.586]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.586 --> 00:29:55.109]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.109 --> 00:29:57.793]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.098 --> 00:30:04.682]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:30:04.682 --> 00:30:05.983]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:30:05.983 --> 00:30:10.388]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:30:10.388 --> 00:30:16.335]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:30:16.335 --> 00:30:18.477]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:30:18.477 --> 00:30:21.160]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:28.003]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:30:28.003 --> 00:30:30.204]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:30:30.204 --> 00:30:35.546]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:30:35.546 --> 00:30:40.828]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:30:40.828 --> 00:30:46.191]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:30:46.191 --> 00:30:49.132]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:30:49.392 --> 00:30:55.177]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:30:55.177 --> 00:31:00.901]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:31:00.901 --> 00:31:07.567]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:31:07.567 --> 00:31:12.711]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:12.711 --> 00:31:14.192]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:31:16.772 --> 00:31:27.650]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:34.513]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:31:34.513 --> 00:31:39.577]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:31:39.577 --> 00:31:41.718]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.718 --> 00:31:43.520]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.402]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:46.402 --> 00:31:53.026]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:31:53.026 --> 00:31:55.728]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:31:55.728 --> 00:31:58.971]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:32:00.114 --> 00:32:04.657]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.657 --> 00:32:05.578]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.578 --> 00:32:09.001]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.001 --> 00:32:09.861]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:14.745]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.745 --> 00:32:15.485]  It's true.
[00:32:15.485 --> 00:32:20.369]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.369 --> 00:32:21.190]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.772]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.772 --> 00:32:28.475]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.675 --> 00:32:29.476]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:32.238]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.238 --> 00:32:35.921]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:36.701]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:40.844]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.844 --> 00:32:45.608]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.908 --> 00:32:50.072]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.072 --> 00:32:51.853]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.853 --> 00:32:56.738]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:56.738 --> 00:33:09.930]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:21.675]  Bob, Mark, Matt, Joel, Austin, your calls are all coming up.
[00:33:21.675 --> 00:33:27.700]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.162]  So, we're now at that point.
[00:33:29.162 --> 00:33:31.984]  We're now descending into the global tyranny.
[00:33:31.984 --> 00:33:36.848]  Everything we told you was brought off their own documents, so of course, it's happened exactly as we told you.
[00:33:38.038 --> 00:33:49.108]  It wasn't any big secret, it's just the mainstream media wouldn't cover it for decades, as patriots worldwide, as lovers of freedom and dignity tried to warn the general public we were laughed at.
[00:33:49.108 --> 00:33:55.093]  But because we planted the seeds, now we have incredible credibility and people are listening to us.
[00:33:55.093 --> 00:33:58.916]  Open world government's been announced, run by the very banks that have engineered the crisis.
[00:33:59.577 --> 00:34:14.034]  They are hiring provocateurs worldwide to burn down buildings, to attack vehicles, to attack shops, as a way to demonize normal protest, so microwave guns, sound cannons, and other weaponry can be used against the population.
[00:34:14.034 --> 00:34:17.277]  Now the globalists know people are going to get angry about this.
[00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:21.079]  They are going to come in with provocateurs to demonize everybody.
[00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:28.343]  They are no doubt, as this gets worse and worse for the next few years, going to stage terror events to demonize all opposition to this.
[00:34:28.343 --> 00:34:36.346]  But it's not going to work because we have been on the job exposing their system of control.
[00:34:36.346 --> 00:34:41.869]  But think how far we've come that now there are scores of news articles today
[00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:52.728]  Today, that sound like it was written by PrisonPlanet.com, or InfoWars.com, that sound like Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, Aaron Dykes, or our other great writers.
[00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:57.311]  It's really happening.
[00:34:57.311 --> 00:35:00.512]  And more and more Americans are having to face the facts.
[00:35:00.512 --> 00:35:01.753]  More and more French.
[00:35:01.753 --> 00:35:02.953]  More and more Brits.
[00:35:02.953 --> 00:35:04.734]  More and more Australians.
[00:35:04.734 --> 00:35:05.774]  More and more Russians.
[00:35:05.774 --> 00:35:09.176]  We are all under the same global corporate government.
[00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:11.717]  They have different management teams over each country.
[00:35:11.717 --> 00:35:14.958]  The management teams fight with each other at certain levels.
[00:35:14.958 --> 00:35:22.822]  China is now announcing they're going to cut off all major key rare minerals that are used in our semiconductor industries and computer development.
[00:35:23.562 --> 00:35:26.123]  They are the majority holder of the debt.
[00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:28.924]  They were set up for this to be the Chinese century.
[00:35:28.924 --> 00:35:31.025]  This was all pre-deployed.
[00:35:31.025 --> 00:35:32.685]  They were given the Panama Canal.
[00:35:32.685 --> 00:35:35.106]  They were given the old military bases in the Caribbean.
[00:35:35.106 --> 00:35:37.287]  They were given the Long Beach Naval Facility.
[00:35:37.287 --> 00:35:40.648]  They were given hundreds of other of our ports, in many cases for free.
[00:35:41.448 --> 00:35:54.840]  To encircle us because the global crime syndicate, the bankers that run our military, that run our police, that run our federal government, they also are in league with the communist Chinese against the American people.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.482]  That doesn't mean the people of China are bad.
[00:35:57.482 --> 00:36:06.489]  But the leadership of the globe has allied, the global corporate Fortune 100 banking cartel has allied itself
[00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:12.451]  With the Communist Chinese as the industrial and military muscle.
[00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:13.111]  The U.S.
[00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:21.032]  funds the global government, then tax incentives are put in place to move our jobs overseas with NAFTA and GATT and globalism.
[00:36:21.032 --> 00:36:25.353]  And now as we go into depression, we are being set up to be fully imploded.
[00:36:25.353 --> 00:36:35.155]  So there's an even bigger fire sale to take over what's left of our society and fully re-engineer our society and make us totally dependent on the globalist.
[00:36:38.081 --> 00:36:40.504]  And I was on Man Cow, big syndicated radio show.
[00:36:40.504 --> 00:36:42.225]  It's on WABC, you name it.
[00:36:42.225 --> 00:36:44.648]  It's on hundreds of stations around the country.
[00:36:44.648 --> 00:36:47.511]  And he was telling me on the show, oh, it's so wonderful.
[00:36:47.511 --> 00:36:51.495]  I was at a banquet last night for friends of the IDF.
[00:36:51.495 --> 00:36:54.478]  And he's like, you know, we know our government's corrupt, but what about Israel?
[00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:55.799]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:36:55.799 --> 00:36:57.440]  All these nations are run by crooks.
[00:36:58.121 --> 00:36:58.721]  Okay?
[00:36:58.721 --> 00:37:00.522]  And they feed on every population.
[00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:01.963]  The Chinese government's bad.
[00:37:01.963 --> 00:37:04.644]  The Chinese people aren't bad, by and large.
[00:37:04.644 --> 00:37:06.746]  The Israeli government, totally corrupt.
[00:37:06.746 --> 00:37:08.727]  Are the Israeli people bad, by and large?
[00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:09.207]  No.
[00:37:09.207 --> 00:37:12.669]  The Saudi Arabians, totally corrupt and decadent, the leadership.
[00:37:12.669 --> 00:37:14.269]  Are the average Saudis bad?
[00:37:14.269 --> 00:37:15.530]  No.
[00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.231]  The American people aren't bad, on average.
[00:37:18.231 --> 00:37:21.033]  Is our government totally run by crooks at the highest levels?
[00:37:21.033 --> 00:37:21.313]  Yes.
[00:37:21.313 --> 00:37:22.874]  That top strata, completely criminal.
[00:37:24.417 --> 00:37:30.442]  And when people who aren't crooks try to get into the power structure, like Rand Paul, they come out and say he's kidnapping women.
[00:37:30.442 --> 00:37:32.043]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:37:32.043 --> 00:37:46.073]  When they start saying somebody's kidnapping women, even when it's admitted to not be true, or they're not a medical doctor when it's admitted to not be true, or that, you know, he's got racists at his tea parties, and they've caught these people being Democratic Party operatives on record, they don't care!
[00:37:46.073 --> 00:37:47.655]  They still go with it!
[00:37:47.655 --> 00:37:50.417]  When somebody's under full attack, you know they're good.
[00:37:50.417 --> 00:37:51.938]  But continuing here.
[00:37:53.376 --> 00:37:59.264]  Then Mankow goes on to say, yeah, isn't Israel cool how they launched the worm attack on the Iranians?
[00:37:59.264 --> 00:38:07.174]  And I said, Mankow, that thing had the secret codes to the core operating system that nobody's got, except for Microsoft.
[00:38:07.174 --> 00:38:07.996]  Two Microsoft.
[00:38:09.603 --> 00:38:21.708]  And I said, you notice they're now announcing that they're going to use this new mega worm as a pretext to pass homeland security takeover of the internet and the Obama kill switch, known as cyber security, started under Bush.
[00:38:21.708 --> 00:38:29.531]  And he said, oh actually at the banquet they were saying that, that they'd have to take over the internet to protect it from the worm that Israel basically admits they created.
[00:38:30.231 --> 00:38:36.277]  And Israel's just as complicit, but you better believe our own government's involved in it as well, and so is Microsoft.
[00:38:36.277 --> 00:38:54.154]  So, so, this is an example of industrial cyber false flag attack, out in the open, no debate, out in the open that the West has launched this attack, it's ultra-sophisticated, against Iran, and that if it blows back to the US, and you know they've got the fixes for it, but they'll never tell you that,
[00:38:54.892 --> 00:38:57.794]  They've got the fixes for their systems, their key infrastructure.
[00:38:57.794 --> 00:39:12.844]  If it blows back, which it looks like it's starting to do, with this mega high-tech 21st century super worm, then the government says, we need to take over web freedom and control everything you're doing to protect you from a worm that we created.
[00:39:12.844 --> 00:39:16.106]  I mean, that's false flag out in the open.
[00:39:16.106 --> 00:39:24.111]  Just like the banks engineering the financial collapse on record came out in the emails from Goldman Sachs and the rest of it, and then their solution is give them more power.
[00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:38.096]  I mean, this is so bald-faced, this is so naked, this is so open, uncloaked, this is so in-your-face, this is so inside job, out in the open.
[00:39:38.096 --> 00:39:43.278]  And I know I'm ranting, it's just... Do you know where all this leads?
[00:39:43.278 --> 00:39:49.140]  It does lead to total, decade-long depression, collapse of society by design.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.501]  I mean, the economy...
[00:39:51.604 --> 00:39:53.946]  The so-called stimulus is just to enrich the banks.
[00:39:53.946 --> 00:39:55.908]  The bailouts are to enrich the insiders.
[00:39:55.908 --> 00:39:56.949]  And now that's running out.
[00:39:56.949 --> 00:39:59.591]  And now they've announced they're going to hyperinflate the currency.
[00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:02.434]  It'll destroy any savings you've got in 401Ks.
[00:40:02.434 --> 00:40:03.275]  You name it.
[00:40:03.275 --> 00:40:04.236]  Stocks, bonds.
[00:40:04.236 --> 00:40:06.178]  I mean, this is unspeakable!
[00:40:07.335 --> 00:40:08.715]  And the globalists are going for broke.
[00:40:08.715 --> 00:40:10.796]  They're bringing in an authoritarian system.
[00:40:10.796 --> 00:40:17.639]  I read to you mainstream news articles saying Obama may need to implement total authoritarian control to save us.
[00:40:17.639 --> 00:40:19.019]  They're now pitching that.
[00:40:19.019 --> 00:40:21.560]  Oh, you yuppies want to keep some of your pension fund?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:28.062]  Let us take control of it, and let us have basically martial law for your security, or things are going to get worse.
[00:40:28.062 --> 00:40:36.085]  And then you give in to them, hoping things are going to get better, and then they make the crisis even worse, and they say, give us more control, and we'll make it better.
[00:40:40.552 --> 00:40:42.614]  It's just exhausting.
[00:40:42.614 --> 00:40:50.721]  It's totally exhausting to know the truth and to realize how horrible it is.
[00:40:50.721 --> 00:40:52.342]  It really does give me a headache.
[00:40:52.342 --> 00:40:54.083]  Okay, let me go over this report.
[00:40:54.083 --> 00:40:56.766]  So now here it is out in the open, Time Magazine.
[00:40:58.109 --> 00:41:09.033]  Oh, that Alex Jones says they're going to collapse the economy and that there's going to be a rebellion against the Federal Reserve as people learn that it's the real government illegitimately running things into the ground for their own consolidation of power.
[00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:10.293]  Oh, that guy's crazy.
[00:41:10.293 --> 00:41:12.394]  He says they're training troops to be on the streets of America.
[00:41:12.394 --> 00:41:13.774]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:41:13.774 --> 00:41:16.735]  They didn't just build this domestic army overnight.
[00:41:16.735 --> 00:41:19.176]  They didn't just put in threat fusion centers overnight.
[00:41:19.176 --> 00:41:22.397]  They didn't just put up face scanning and license plate reading cameras overnight.
[00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:27.359]  They didn't just federalize your public school and put biometrics in to train your kids for casual society overnight.
[00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:30.600]  They didn't just gear up or force inoculations overnight.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.022]  They didn't just put sodium fluoride in the water overnight.
[00:41:34.022 --> 00:41:38.925]  This is all part of an overall scientific dictatorship.
[00:41:38.925 --> 00:41:40.065]  Now, continuing.
[00:41:40.065 --> 00:41:43.087]  Will the Federal Reserve cause a civil war?
[00:41:43.087 --> 00:41:45.708]  What is the most likely cause of civil unrest?
[00:41:45.708 --> 00:41:47.889]  Immigration?
[00:41:47.889 --> 00:41:48.590]  Gay marriage?
[00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.530]  Abortion?
[00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.011]  The result of Election Day?
[00:41:51.011 --> 00:41:52.472]  The mosque at Ground Zero?
[00:41:52.472 --> 00:41:52.632]  No.
[00:41:53.922 --> 00:41:56.443]  Try the Federal Reserve.
[00:41:56.443 --> 00:42:00.185]  November 3rd is when the Federal Reserve's next policy committee meeting ends.
[00:42:00.185 --> 00:42:03.847]  And if you thought this was just another boring money meeting, you would be wrong.
[00:42:03.847 --> 00:42:06.328]  It could be the most important meeting in Fed history.
[00:42:06.328 --> 00:42:07.128]  Maybe the U.S.
[00:42:07.128 --> 00:42:12.611]  Central Bank is expected to announce in the next move to boost the faltering economic recovery.
[00:42:12.611 --> 00:42:13.351]  There's the lie.
[00:42:13.351 --> 00:42:14.512]  Oh, they want to fix it.
[00:42:14.512 --> 00:42:16.393]  Oh, they want to help you.
[00:42:16.393 --> 00:42:18.614]  In their next move to try to fix the faltering economy,
[00:42:19.634 --> 00:42:29.218]  Uh, and recovery to say that there has been considerable debate and anxiety among Fed watchers about what the central bank should do would be an understatement.
[00:42:29.218 --> 00:42:38.341]  Chairman Ben Bernanke has indicated in recent speeches that the central bank plans to try to drive down already low interest rates by buying up long-term bonds.
[00:42:38.341 --> 00:42:43.223]  A number of people both inside the Fed and out believe that this is the wrong move.
[00:42:43.223 --> 00:42:48.005]  But one website seems to believe that Ben's plan might actually lead to armed conflict.
[00:42:50.302 --> 00:42:51.663]  And I didn't click on that link.
[00:42:51.663 --> 00:42:55.784]  Will you guys click on that link there in the second paragraph and see what website they're talking about?
[00:42:55.784 --> 00:42:57.625]  I think they're talking about Zero Hedge.
[00:42:57.625 --> 00:43:07.209]  Last week, the blog Zero Hedge wrote, paraphrasing a top economic forecaster, David Rosenberg, that it believes the Fed's plan is not only moronic, but positions U.S.
[00:43:07.209 --> 00:43:10.410]  solely one step closer to civil war, if not worse.
[00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.771]  We just read British economist saying the same thing.
[00:43:14.318 --> 00:43:19.082]  I'm not sure what if not worse means is supposed to mean.
[00:43:19.082 --> 00:43:20.623]  If not worse than civil war.
[00:43:20.623 --> 00:43:28.810]  But with the Tea Party gaining followers, the idea of civil war over economic issues doesn't seem that far-fetched these days, and Ron Paul definitely thinks the Fed should be ended.
[00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:36.397]  In Time's recent cover story on the militia movement, many said these groups are powder kegs looking for a catalyst.
[00:43:36.397 --> 00:43:39.719]  Oh, so see, it's not the bankers' fault doing this to us.
[00:43:39.719 --> 00:43:43.102]  It's the militias and its tea parties and its gun owners.
[00:43:43.102 --> 00:43:44.964]  They are the threats, see?
[00:43:44.964 --> 00:43:48.947]  But don't worry, the army's waiting and been quietly training for that.
[00:43:48.947 --> 00:43:52.910]  They'll make sure the bankers can really take over.
[00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:53.110]  So...
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.742]  Why not a Fed Policy Committee meeting?
[00:43:56.742 --> 00:44:00.486]  Still, I'm not convinced we're headed towards Fedmageddon.
[00:44:00.486 --> 00:44:04.049]  That being said, the Fed's early November meeting is an important one.
[00:44:04.049 --> 00:44:05.170]  Here's why.
[00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.594]  Usually, there is generally a consensus about what the Federal Reserve should do.
[00:44:08.594 --> 00:44:13.739]  When the economy is weak, the Fed cuts short-term interest rates to spur borrowing economic activity.
[00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:17.162]  When the economy is strong and inflation is rising, it does the opposite.
[00:44:17.162 --> 00:44:27.370]  But nearly two years after the Fed cut short-term interest rates basically to zero, well, for the banks it's zero, for you it's 30%, more and more economists are questioning whether the U.S.
[00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.011]  Central Bank is making the right moves.
[00:44:29.011 --> 00:44:33.155]  It's making the right moves to destroy the economy and consolidate power and hyperinflate the currency.
[00:44:33.155 --> 00:44:35.416]  I mean, right move for them, record bonuses.
[00:44:35.416 --> 00:44:36.738]  Stock market down, banks up.
[00:44:37.611 --> 00:44:38.912]  That was the Bloomberg headline yesterday.
[00:44:38.912 --> 00:44:39.513]  How about 22?
[00:44:39.513 --> 00:44:39.973]  Time magazine.
[00:44:39.973 --> 00:44:43.617]  That's why Ben Bernanke has been recently talking about something called quantitative easing.
[00:44:58.231 --> 00:45:00.132]  That's when they monetize the debt.
[00:45:00.132 --> 00:45:08.719]  That's when the Fed basically creates money to buy the long-term bonds that it does directly, doesn't directly control, and drive down those interest rates as well.
[00:45:08.719 --> 00:45:12.281]  That should further reduce the cost of borrowing for large companies and homeowners.
[00:45:12.281 --> 00:45:13.102]  Uh-uh.
[00:45:13.102 --> 00:45:14.363]  The banks aren't loaning.
[00:45:14.363 --> 00:45:21.648]  Some people are calling it QE2 because the Fed made a similar move during the height of the financial crisis when it bought mortgage bonds.
[00:45:22.523 --> 00:45:24.085]  Not everybody agrees with this move.
[00:45:24.085 --> 00:45:31.995]  In fact, a number of presidents of regional Fed banks, not all of which get to vote on Fed policy meetings, have recently come out against Bernanke's plans.
[00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:33.497]  Some say it sets bad policy.
[00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:34.038]  Others think it will...
[00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:39.817]  Stoke inflation, which might be the point.
[00:45:39.817 --> 00:45:43.541]  Well, yeah, the Fed said they want to use inflation to pay off the debt.
[00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:46.184]  Few, though, have warned of armed conflict.
[00:45:46.184 --> 00:45:52.431]  Here's how Zero Heads justifies its prediction of how the Fed's November 3rd meeting will lead to violence.
[00:45:52.431 --> 00:45:53.352]  And they have a link to that.
[00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:54.845]  And it goes on...
[00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:24.124]  And in a just nation, where the rule of law controlled, instead of being abused by kleptocrats, that's thieving politicians, he would be facing charges of seditious conspiracy as his policies will inevitably lead to the destruction of our republic.
[00:46:24.705 --> 00:46:25.546]  I agree.
[00:46:25.546 --> 00:46:36.114]  Okay, the idea that Bernanke will kill large swaths of low-income neighborhoods or Florida by his plan to further lower interest rates is a little ridiculous.
[00:46:36.114 --> 00:46:40.798]  Hyperinflation won't hurt people already on the verge of starving, you mean?
[00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.599]  You don't know about that, Time magazine?
[00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:45.942]  But there is a point in Zero Hedge's craze.
[00:46:45.942 --> 00:46:48.664]  Lower rates do tend to favor borrowers over savers.
[00:46:49.935 --> 00:46:54.017]  And the largest borrowers in the country are banks, speculators, and large corporations.
[00:46:54.017 --> 00:46:55.558]  Yeah, they get it for close to zero.
[00:46:55.558 --> 00:46:58.600]  The largest spenders in the country, though, tend to be individuals.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:04.343]  Consumer spending makes up 70% of the economy, and the vast majority of consumers are on the low end of income scale.
[00:47:04.343 --> 00:47:13.007]  So I think it's a valid question to ask whether the Feds desire to drive down interest rates at all cost.
[00:47:13.007 --> 00:47:13.688]  And it goes on.
[00:47:13.688 --> 00:47:16.089]  Companies are already borrowing at low rates.
[00:47:16.089 --> 00:47:17.330]  They are just not spending.
[00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:21.392]  That being said, civil war, probably not.
[00:47:21.392 --> 00:47:28.155]  It is a gross exaggeration, says Alan Meltzer, who is a top Fed historian at Carnegie Mellon.
[00:47:28.155 --> 00:47:34.737]  I cannot recall ever learning about riots or civil war, even when the Fed made other mistakes.
[00:47:34.737 --> 00:47:35.838]  Not a mistake.
[00:47:35.838 --> 00:47:46.662]  When I called David Rosenberg, he was traveling and couldn't talk, but he did send me a quick email to stress that he never, ever suggested that any moves the Fed makes will lead to militia uprising.
[00:47:46.662 --> 00:47:47.442]  No, he talked about
[00:47:48.993 --> 00:47:52.914]  Protesting and disintegration of society.
[00:47:52.914 --> 00:48:03.217]  Some smart people, though, including Metzler, it appears, and Rosenberg, do think the path of quantitative easing that the Fed looks likely to embark on is the wrong move.
[00:48:03.217 --> 00:48:09.719]  John Taylor, a top Fed scholar at Stanford, says eventually you will have to pull the support out.
[00:48:09.719 --> 00:48:16.801]  And when you do it, a year from now, and when the economy is recovering, he thinks it could be quantitatively disruptive.
[00:48:17.639 --> 00:48:17.859]  Thank you.
[00:48:32.211 --> 00:48:42.414]  And it goes through some more economists who has become famous for warning about the possibility of financial crisis back in 05, believes low interest rates could be creating new bubbles in say gold and other commodities.
[00:48:42.414 --> 00:48:45.895]  So, it seems clear that the Fed is likely to do.
[00:48:45.895 --> 00:48:49.936]  How the economy, the militias, and the rest of us react is up in the air.
[00:48:49.936 --> 00:48:51.116]  The countdown is on.
[00:48:51.116 --> 00:48:53.957]  T-minus 15 days to Fedmageddon.
[00:48:53.957 --> 00:48:55.097]  See you there, hopefully.
[00:48:55.757 --> 00:49:02.638]  So I'm not a newsreader, but I babbled through that entire article, and it's just a bunch of tripe, basically.
[00:49:02.638 --> 00:49:06.539]  But there is Time Magazine.
[00:49:06.539 --> 00:49:09.979]  Will the Federal Reserve cause civil war?
[00:49:09.979 --> 00:49:12.520]  Well, look at what's happening over in Europe.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:18.421]  Nicolas Sarkozy calls for calm as French pension protests gather pace.
[00:49:18.421 --> 00:49:24.742]  Cars burn, shop windows smash, and 4,000 petrol stations awaiting supplies on sixth day of French protest.
[00:49:25.382 --> 00:49:30.985]  And it goes on to report that the strikes and giant protests are now accelerating.
[00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:33.586]  The country is now grinding to a halt.
[00:49:33.586 --> 00:49:39.789]  France 24 TV reports violent protests have weakened unions in retirement battle.
[00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:43.250]  And that's the Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:51.294]  Basically breaks that down in more detail, showing that clearly many of these anarchists are working with the police.
[00:49:52.674 --> 00:49:53.374]  Here's another one.
[00:49:53.374 --> 00:49:54.695]  Rioters rampage.
[00:49:54.695 --> 00:49:56.997]  Protesters block French airports.
[00:49:56.997 --> 00:50:09.324]  Workers, opposed to higher retirement age, blocked access to airports in Paris and around the country on Wednesday as hooded youths smashed door windows amid clouds of tear gas outside the Capitol.
[00:50:09.324 --> 00:50:12.426]  So the real protesters are blocking airports and petrol stations.
[00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:16.769]  All you gotta do is, you know, 20 of you get together and park your cars and take the keys out.
[00:50:16.769 --> 00:50:17.729]  Others join you.
[00:50:17.729 --> 00:50:21.732]  You get 100 cars blocking the road, then 1,000 cars blocking the road.
[00:50:21.732 --> 00:50:22.152]  It's over.
[00:50:23.533 --> 00:50:25.534]  You just leave and your car's there.
[00:50:25.534 --> 00:50:28.897]  There's no way they can even get to it to tow it out of there.
[00:50:28.897 --> 00:50:29.957]  That ends it right there.
[00:50:29.957 --> 00:50:31.718]  You just walk off.
[00:50:31.718 --> 00:50:39.904]  But, having the little anarchists, run by the big foundations on record, smashing store windows, setting private cars on fire, beating up people.
[00:50:41.348 --> 00:50:43.129]  That is government-funded.
[00:50:43.129 --> 00:50:51.916]  And all they gotta do is get the first vanguard doing it, who are government-funded, then other useful idiots and ne'er-do-wells, uh, they join in with the overall operation.
[00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:52.756]  Okay.
[00:50:52.756 --> 00:50:59.101]  I'm gonna take calls and cover other economic and political news, uh, throughout the next hour and ten minutes, and we got a guest in studio.
[00:50:59.101 --> 00:50:59.481]  Stay with us.

[00:52:03.468 --> 00:52:05.688]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.688 --> 00:52:09.010]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:14.111]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.111 --> 00:52:18.293]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.613 --> 00:52:20.977]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.977 --> 00:52:23.861]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.861 --> 00:52:26.765]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.765 --> 00:52:34.377]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.713 --> 00:52:40.098]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.098 --> 00:52:42.940]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:46.623]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.623 --> 00:52:47.704]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.704 --> 00:52:49.045]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:26.964]  We've got a global group of crooks already running a banking dictatorship.
[00:54:26.964 --> 00:54:29.626]  And everything's working like a charm for them.
[00:54:29.626 --> 00:54:31.187]  Oops, they keep causing depressions.
[00:54:31.187 --> 00:54:33.008]  Oops, they keep getting record bonuses.
[00:54:33.008 --> 00:54:36.130]  Oops, they keep bankrupting societies.
[00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:40.754]  But don't worry, they've got some more money they made up out of nothing to loan you.
[00:54:40.754 --> 00:54:41.054]  At 30% interest.
[00:54:43.519 --> 00:54:46.762]  Aren't we lucky we've got the banking cartels?
[00:54:46.762 --> 00:54:49.505]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls for at least the next 30-40 minutes.
[00:54:49.505 --> 00:55:03.078]  I got a bunch of other news I'm gonna cover later in the next hour on the politics of what's happening in this country and how the government's pre-positioning the media now to demonize anybody that doesn't like the Federal Reserve raping us financially.
[00:55:03.078 --> 00:55:05.540]  I also just want to briefly add
[00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:11.971]  That we've got two new videos that are set to ship in the next four or five days.
[00:55:11.971 --> 00:55:15.492]  We're just now getting them in, and that is, What in the World Do They Spring?
[00:55:15.492 --> 00:55:18.053]  Dealing with Geoengineering and Chemtrails, G.E.B.
[00:55:18.053 --> 00:55:34.938]  Griffin's new film, and the part two of Camp FEMA, Enemy of the State, that I'm a big part of, and really has a lot of well-documented information in it dealing with how the government's preparing for a martial law cover story dealing with the flu, other biological release,
[00:55:36.246 --> 00:55:41.649]  And it's got eyewitnesses that have worked in government and in security dealing with that and how they've been preparing for it.
[00:55:41.649 --> 00:55:43.589]  That's just one facet of Enemy of the State.
[00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:48.192]  They're all available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:55:48.192 --> 00:55:58.797]  So if you want to get them first to get your order in because Enemy of the State is set to ship in the next few days and so is the amazing film
[00:55:59.577 --> 00:56:01.899]  Of course, what in the world are they spraying?
[00:56:01.899 --> 00:56:07.124]  888-253-3139 or Infowars.com to order online.
[00:56:07.124 --> 00:56:10.807]  Let's go to Bob in Texas and then Mark, Matt, Joel and Austin and others.
[00:56:10.807 --> 00:56:25.820]  So Bob, I've just spent 55 minutes roughly talking about now open discussion of, oh, there might be financial collapse and riots, but don't worry, the army just now is getting on standby just now to fix it, Bob.
[00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:30.053]  Hey, thank you Alex, first time caller.
[00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:43.923]  I started to say something else, but hearing you say what you just said, this reminds me of what you said before I met you at the Austin Gun Show, when you described yourself, Alex, at 3 o'clock in the morning calling out to God concerning
[00:56:44.984 --> 00:56:56.266]  This InfoWars revolution, and I told those God show people, I want you to read this Hebrews 9 passage and learn about God's sovereignty that you've got in your Constitution, people!
[00:56:56.266 --> 00:56:57.126]  Did you hear?
[00:56:57.126 --> 00:56:57.787]  Did you hear?
[00:56:57.787 --> 00:57:00.227]  Alex, not too many of them heard you.
[00:57:00.227 --> 00:57:08.169]  Alex, this reminds me, Monday, boy, you conveyed your, and this morning, you've described your headache.
[00:57:08.169 --> 00:57:10.189]  Let me tell you something, my fellow listeners.
[00:57:11.049 --> 00:57:17.911]  Are we admitting to ourselves that we're seeing the real Alex here?
[00:57:17.911 --> 00:57:21.593]  That he's not covering anything up?
[00:57:21.593 --> 00:57:26.894]  And he's not hesitating to make me mad and make you mad and make me think he's insane?
[00:57:29.889 --> 00:57:34.531]  Because he's really honest and sincere about how sincere this is.
[00:57:34.531 --> 00:57:39.094]  Lizard, we need to ask ourselves a question about this whole thing.
[00:57:39.094 --> 00:57:42.315]  We've ignored Jesus and his will and testament.
[00:57:42.315 --> 00:57:46.497]  You people have heard a lot of times on this program about Hebrews 9.
[00:57:46.497 --> 00:57:49.719]  Thank you, Alex, for letting it be said several times.
[00:57:49.719 --> 00:57:51.480]  People, are we reading it?
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:58.303]  Are we reading what God has to... By the way, Red Beckman called this constitution the forefather's will and testament.
[00:57:58.884 --> 00:58:04.877]  My question is, hey Red Beckman, did you say that because of Hebrews 9 and the will of the Testament Jesus?
[00:58:04.877 --> 00:58:06.822]  Jesus unfolded, Alex, in Acts 2.
[00:58:08.041 --> 00:58:18.689]  Through those 12 miles of those microphones down there on Earth, his rule as king started right there in Acts 2, 53 days after they killed him.
[00:58:18.689 --> 00:58:21.751]  And that's what you read in Revelation, Alex.
[00:58:21.751 --> 00:58:29.437]  Anyway, I don't know what this sounds like to you people, but I get more and more riled up about this revolution, about these devils.
[00:58:30.552 --> 00:58:35.779]  Serpents, dogs, enemies of our Creator, and us!
[00:58:35.779 --> 00:58:37.581]  Bob, I can tell you're a preacher.
[00:58:37.581 --> 00:58:38.442]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:38.442 --> 00:58:42.467]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[00:58:42.467 --> 00:58:45.992]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:59:56.322 --> 00:59:59.125]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:10.645]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.645 --> 01:00:12.228]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.228 --> 01:00:13.770]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:17.975]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.975 --> 01:00:22.021]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:25.457]  Well, we're now into hour number two.
[01:00:25.457 --> 01:00:26.817]  Wide open telephones.
[01:00:26.817 --> 01:00:29.938]  I'm going to get more into all the mainstream media reporting.
[01:00:29.938 --> 01:00:34.400]  Oh, martial law might be coming to keep you safe from the economic collapse.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:40.902]  Aren't we glad the bankers set up this police state a decade plus ago ahead of them thieving us?
[01:00:40.902 --> 01:00:44.883]  That's all coming up with the latest economic news, a bunch of police state news.
[01:00:44.883 --> 01:00:47.564]  Also, with the superconducting supercollider in Switzerland.
[01:00:48.735 --> 01:00:49.676]  Morning, Alex.
[01:00:49.676 --> 01:00:50.216]  Hey, buddy.
[01:01:14.244 --> 01:01:19.389]  Hey Alex, about six weeks ago on your show you spontaneously prayed a prayer of repentance.
[01:01:19.389 --> 01:01:21.070]  Do you remember that?
[01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:34.041]  Yes, I said we need to pray to God for all of us have been corrupt and decadent and mindless and we need to get ourselves right with God because, folks, this is just the beginning of everything you're seeing.
[01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:41.848]  You, in particular, at that time, prayed a prayer for the abominable sin of abortion, repenting against that, basically.
[01:01:42.646 --> 01:01:59.957]  And I just wanted you to know, Alex, that your sincere and heartfelt prayer of repentance inspired me to begin a movement of the True Church of God to publicly and sincerely repent unto our God for the sins of America, that is, the sins of commission and the sins of omission.
[01:01:59.957 --> 01:02:11.524]  This is what Almighty God expects and requires of His True Church in America, and until His True Church truly repents for the multitude of abominable sins of the evildoers and its own sins of omission,
[01:02:11.986 --> 01:02:17.613]  And not standing up, combating and resisting the flood of evil which is coming to our country.
[01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:21.210]  God's mighty hand of protection and guidance will not come back.
[01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:31.312]  Well, I mean, even if you don't, and I agree with you, but even if you don't believe in God, if you rationalize killing 50 plus million babies and saying they're not human, well then of course Bill Gates is going to come out and say kill old people.
[01:02:31.312 --> 01:02:35.674]  I mean, of course they're going to have Newsweek saying the case for killing Granny.
[01:02:35.674 --> 01:02:38.734]  Abortion comes from the modern eugenics movement.
[01:02:38.734 --> 01:02:39.775]  They admit it.
[01:02:39.775 --> 01:02:43.956]  And now Scientific American says more abortions, more, kill more babies.
[01:02:43.956 --> 01:02:44.716]  It's for the earth.
[01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:50.130]  This is their religion of anti-human, okay?
[01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:57.693]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy, and we all need to repent for not doing more to stop this evil.
[01:02:57.693 --> 01:02:59.753]  But of course, you know, more evil's gonna come.
[01:02:59.753 --> 01:03:06.215]  If we lie to ourselves, by the way, women, it doubles your chance of cervical and uterine and ovarian cancer.
[01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.996]  Just search that term, you'll get mainstream scientific reports.
[01:03:08.996 --> 01:03:12.077]  You have one abortion, it doubles your chances of cancer.
[01:03:12.597 --> 01:03:18.260]  And it affects breast as well, because it manipulates the hormones, but it doesn't quite double it.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.741]  You pull up the statistics, but it's around a 20% increase.
[01:03:20.741 --> 01:03:24.042]  Each abortion you get is a death sentence for yourself.
[01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:26.223]  Now, they don't tell you that.
[01:03:26.223 --> 01:03:32.866]  See, if the baby needs to die, your body knows that and turns the lights out.
[01:03:32.866 --> 01:03:35.787]  It's a sad thing, but your body knows what to do 99% of the time.
[01:03:37.169 --> 01:03:43.988]  Okay, but when you go in there and have them destroy a new life in you and cut that whole process off, the body...
[01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:50.160]  Basically hits a self-destruct button, and the countdown to your early death has begun.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:04:00.402]  And I'm sorry for women to have to tell you this, but all the numbers show, you might as well drink Jack Daniels every day and smoke two packs of Marlboro Reds, because it's a lot better for you to do that than to kill babies.
[01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:09.243]  I mean, your body says, well, this doesn't make sense, and it fries all your hormonal connections, you know, the endocrine channels, everything.
[01:04:09.243 --> 01:04:12.544]  But I'm, we're going to break, but give us 30 seconds more, Mark.
[01:04:13.055 --> 01:04:19.921]  Yes, Alex, I'm calling for a day of national public repentance all across this country on December 11th of this year.
[01:04:19.921 --> 01:04:22.283]  A little less than two months from now.
[01:04:22.283 --> 01:04:24.905]  And I'd like to give out the website to some people.
[01:04:24.905 --> 01:04:32.011]  My name and phone number is on the website, and you can call me to come on as a small-time guest to basically go over this day.
[01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:32.832]  Okay, give us the website, Mark.
[01:04:32.832 --> 01:04:34.313]  It's AmericanDayOfRepentance.net.
[01:04:34.313 --> 01:04:37.816]  That's AmericanDayOfRepentance.net.
[01:04:39.998 --> 01:04:45.343]  Yeah, we need to repent.
[01:04:45.343 --> 01:04:50.428]  I mean, all of us about not being serious minded, not facing down evil when we see it.
[01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:51.949]  I mean, folks, don't deny it.
[01:04:51.949 --> 01:04:55.132]  We're one wicked, degenerate country on average.
[01:04:55.132 --> 01:04:56.393]  And look where we're headed.
[01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:57.254]  We're headed to Hades.
[01:05:02.293 --> 01:05:06.317]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:06.317 --> 01:05:09.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:14.725]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:14.725 --> 01:05:20.750]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.993]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:23.533 --> 01:05:23.833]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:24.333]  Bernanke?
[01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:25.014]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:25.014 --> 01:05:26.294]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:26.294 --> 01:05:28.536]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:42.423 --> 01:05:46.807]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:05:46.807 --> 01:05:49.709]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:05:49.709 --> 01:05:59.056]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:01.235 --> 01:06:04.818]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:06:04.818 --> 01:06:06.119]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:06:06.119 --> 01:06:10.523]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:06:10.523 --> 01:06:16.469]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:06:16.469 --> 01:06:18.610]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:21.293]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:06:21.633 --> 01:06:28.138]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:28.138 --> 01:06:30.339]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:06:30.339 --> 01:06:35.683]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:06:35.683 --> 01:06:40.967]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:06:40.967 --> 01:06:46.131]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:06:46.331 --> 01:06:49.533]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[01:06:49.533 --> 01:06:52.535]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:52.535 --> 01:06:53.296]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:04.717 --> 01:07:05.958]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:05.958 --> 01:07:09.902]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.902 --> 01:07:12.145]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:12.145 --> 01:07:18.011]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:18.011 --> 01:07:24.217]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:24.657 --> 01:07:30.642]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:30.642 --> 01:07:34.825]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.825 --> 01:07:39.109]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:45.054]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:45.054 --> 01:07:48.617]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:48.617 --> 01:07:50.598]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:50.598 --> 01:07:51.019]  It's here.

[01:08:02.139 --> 01:08:04.361]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:08.223]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.223 --> 01:08:11.806]  It is the 20th day of October on this live Wednesday edition.
[01:08:11.806 --> 01:08:13.267]  We're going four hours today.
[01:08:13.267 --> 01:08:18.010]  Expert on the mortgage fraud and how to counter it will be in studio with us.
[01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:20.852]  Coming up in T-Minute, 52 minutes from now.
[01:08:20.852 --> 01:08:22.073]  We're taking your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:08:22.073 --> 01:08:23.694]  Matt in Florida, thanks for holding here on the air.
[01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:28.958]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:30.878]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[01:08:30.878 --> 01:08:35.880]  To comment on what you said right before the last break about the country headed to Hades, you're absolutely right.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.402]  And we deserve everything we're getting for the decadence we've put on ourselves.
[01:08:40.402 --> 01:08:47.345]  But luckily for us, we have a forgiving God who will, if we repent to Him, He'll take us back into His arms and hopefully bless us.
[01:08:48.405 --> 01:08:53.548]  Matt, we don't screen calls unless I have a special guest on and it's on a certain topic.
[01:08:53.548 --> 01:09:01.813]  Or, you know, once a month I'll say only military callers, or only doctors if it's on a specific issue, or only veterans who are exposed to DU.
[01:09:01.813 --> 01:09:03.854]  But we didn't screen your calls.
[01:09:03.854 --> 01:09:05.575]  We just asked where you were calling from.
[01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:11.198]  And notice the last three callers are bringing up repentance, and I find that interesting, don't you?
[01:09:13.376 --> 01:09:18.860]  We're staring at that as almost the last hope that we have, but I did have a point I wanted to bring up to you.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:27.866]  I don't know if you're aware, here in Florida we have a media cover-up and actual manipulation of the elections going on here.
[01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:29.578]  In the U.S.
[01:09:29.578 --> 01:09:34.144]  Senate race, you would think we only have three people running for Senator.
[01:09:34.144 --> 01:09:45.019]  There's actually nine, with one of them being a Libertarian candidate that has been excluded from every debate, and we've even protested at the locations where they were holding them.
[01:09:45.239 --> 01:09:56.405]  Well, if people want reform, that's one of the big ones, is to demand that all the major candidates, you know, be allowed in the debates, and that people need to stop voting for who they think the winner is.
[01:09:56.405 --> 01:10:01.088]  Well, the lesser of two evils, I'll vote for... No, vote for who stands on principle.
[01:10:04.707 --> 01:10:19.616]  Their explanation for him not being incorporated in the debates is that he's not polling above 10%, but when you look at the polls, they only list the three main candidates, the Independent, Democrat, and Republican, and then give a fourth choice of other.
[01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:26.801]  He's not even included on the poll to then look at the poll and then say, okay, you can participate in the debate.
[01:10:26.801 --> 01:10:29.222]  Most of the real polls have been showing him at about 15%.
[01:10:31.064 --> 01:10:43.897]  Uh, and you can see where we've protested and been met by, uh, armed police officers and security guards at the, uh, locations, um, at SNIT, as in Tom, K-E-R-2-0-1-0-dot-com.
[01:10:43.897 --> 01:10:47.922]  You can find the video of how we've protested every debate.
[01:10:47.922 --> 01:10:49.343]  Um, they've not let us in.
[01:10:49.343 --> 01:10:52.567]  They've actually held us, you know, from even getting near the, uh,
[01:10:53.187 --> 01:10:54.007]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:10:54.007 --> 01:10:55.248]  Very interesting points, Matt.
[01:10:55.248 --> 01:10:56.768]  I'm going to go to Joel Austin.
[01:10:56.768 --> 01:10:57.508]  I'm going to go to Candace.
[01:11:20.334 --> 01:11:20.635]  I'm going to
[01:11:38.214 --> 01:11:46.926]  People say, oh, I just want you to respond, and then you respond a hundred times, and then people just want attention, and they want you to respond, respond, respond, respond.
[01:11:46.926 --> 01:11:54.797]  But this guy sounded a little bit more, you know, friendly and reasonable, and I only watched part of it because I was so busy and had to move on.
[01:11:55.598 --> 01:11:59.421]  And a lot of times I don't respond to this type of stuff because it's so ridiculous.
[01:11:59.421 --> 01:12:00.221]  I know I'm good.
[01:12:00.221 --> 01:12:01.722]  I know I'm real.
[01:12:01.722 --> 01:12:04.244]  Look at the fruits of what this radio show has done.
[01:12:04.244 --> 01:12:05.985]  You will know them by their works.
[01:12:05.985 --> 01:12:08.907]  And it doesn't matter even if I was a bad guy.
[01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:10.909]  The issues we're covering are real.
[01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:13.891]  What are you going to do about hyperinflation that the Fed's announcing they're going to do?
[01:12:14.551 --> 01:12:20.060]  What are you going to do about the fact that they're openly announcing putting troops on the streets to control the American people?
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.502]  They told you it was for Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:21.502 --> 01:12:26.450]  What are we going to do about them pushing the deadly H1N1 flu shot combined with the seasonal flu again?
[01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:29.414]  You know, I stay on issue, I stay on topic, but...
[01:12:31.069 --> 01:12:36.592]  This is an example of things being hidden in plain view and folks not being able to understand what it is.
[01:12:36.592 --> 01:12:43.075]  So I want to put the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com website up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:43.075 --> 01:12:51.060]  This guy, who I've even interviewed before, he's an author, put a video out asking me to respond to what this is at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:55.362]  Well, what this is is a 30-second conversation with Phil, our graphics guy.
[01:12:55.362 --> 01:12:56.483]  We've got two graphics people.
[01:12:57.483 --> 01:13:00.445]  And he said about two months ago, what type of money bomb website?
[01:13:00.445 --> 01:13:08.269]  And I said, I want an American flag background with a, an American flag motif with a radio tower on it.
[01:13:08.269 --> 01:13:14.613]  And so he went to ClipArt on Google, you know, free public images, and he said, what radio towers do you like?
[01:13:14.613 --> 01:13:16.914]  And I said, I like that old 40s design.
[01:13:16.914 --> 01:13:23.678]  And I said, as the money comes in, instead of having a thermometer like we had last time, it'll be a radio tower.
[01:13:23.678 --> 01:13:25.319]  And that's what he made.
[01:13:25.319 --> 01:13:26.500]  Now, put it back on screen.
[01:13:27.631 --> 01:13:28.532]  Okay?
[01:13:28.532 --> 01:13:34.835]  And I saw this video with, like, 5,000 views, going, it's the proof he's Illuminati, saying that's a pyramid.
[01:13:34.835 --> 01:13:36.236]  That is not a pyramid.
[01:13:36.236 --> 01:13:38.017]  That is a radio tower.
[01:13:38.017 --> 01:13:40.658]  Then they say, what are the lightning bolts?
[01:13:40.658 --> 01:13:44.460]  That's the radio tower symbols, a tower with waves coming out of it.
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.461]  I'm a radio host.
[01:13:45.461 --> 01:13:46.482]  Come on!
[01:13:46.482 --> 01:13:48.163]  That's not a pyramid.
[01:13:48.163 --> 01:13:49.944]  Then they say, what's the star?
[01:13:49.944 --> 01:13:51.404]  It's the lone star of Texas.
[01:13:51.404 --> 01:13:52.725]  Now, I didn't design that part.
[01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:54.846]  I said a Stars and Stripes motif.
[01:13:54.846 --> 01:13:55.687]  You got blue,
[01:13:56.787 --> 01:13:58.008]  Red, white, and blue's the colors.
[01:13:58.008 --> 01:14:03.150]  You got, you know, straight up stars on the blue, and you got a star in the middle.
[01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:03.750]  Okay?
[01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:04.931]  Now, that's what that is.
[01:14:04.931 --> 01:14:05.571]  That's what that is.
[01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:06.732]  That is not a pyramid.
[01:14:06.732 --> 01:14:08.272]  That is not Illuminati.
[01:14:08.272 --> 01:14:09.553]  That is not New World Order.
[01:14:09.553 --> 01:14:11.654]  Give me a stinking break!
[01:14:11.654 --> 01:14:14.735]  And, oh, here's another question I get about this, and I'm going back to your calls.
[01:14:14.735 --> 01:14:18.697]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com and just go to the top.
[01:14:18.697 --> 01:14:22.059]  I asked Janae, our great graphics lady, she lives out in California,
[01:14:23.695 --> 01:14:24.840]  Go over to the side, actually.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.145]  I don't know where that logo is.
[01:14:28.437 --> 01:14:31.178]  Somewhere, oh, there it is, there it is, on the right-hand corner.
[01:14:31.178 --> 01:14:33.839]  See the blue prisonplanet.tv banner?
[01:14:33.839 --> 01:14:38.460]  I get emails all the time saying that's a swastika, or that's an occult symbol.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:40.801]  That's PP, prison planet.
[01:14:40.801 --> 01:14:41.922]  PP.
[01:14:41.922 --> 01:14:43.202]  PP.
[01:14:43.202 --> 01:14:44.443]  Okay?
[01:14:44.443 --> 01:14:45.783]  That's what that is.
[01:14:45.783 --> 01:14:50.304]  I mean, people don't know what a radio tower is, they don't know what two Ps are.
[01:14:50.304 --> 01:14:57.387]  And another thing, the globalists create similar symbols because they're archetypal symbols that communicate with us at our deepest levels.
[01:14:58.684 --> 01:15:04.369]  Obviously, a pinwheel, or a flower, or a sun symbol is powerful and evocative.
[01:15:04.369 --> 01:15:05.530]  Those are our symbols.
[01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:09.433]  The globalists just use archetypal symbols to control people.
[01:15:09.433 --> 01:15:12.296]  So, I say, give me logos.
[01:15:12.296 --> 01:15:16.540]  They send me 10, 15 different ideas, and I literally spend 10 seconds and go, I like that one.
[01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:25.608]  Or I say, give me an American flag background and a radio tower, because Phil's like, do you want to have a thermometer like last year with the money bomb?
[01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:28.072]  And I said, no, everybody uses a thermometer.
[01:15:28.072 --> 01:15:29.375]  Let's have a radio tower.
[01:15:31.343 --> 01:15:36.184]  You know, as the donations go up, it'll show that we're going to be able to transmit out.
[01:15:36.184 --> 01:15:39.025]  Then the money stopped at $400,000.
[01:15:39.025 --> 01:15:40.586]  I saw comments on there.
[01:15:40.586 --> 01:15:42.786]  I was reading these marveling at it.
[01:15:42.786 --> 01:15:43.866]  Put it back up.
[01:15:43.866 --> 01:15:44.247]  Thank you.
[01:15:44.247 --> 01:15:46.827]  On Friday, the money stopped at $400,000, $100,000 short.
[01:15:49.728 --> 01:15:54.649]  And so then they said, look, it made a capstone on the pyramid.
[01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:57.190]  I mean, it just there's no end to this.
[01:15:57.190 --> 01:15:58.910]  That's a radio tower.
[01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:01.511]  And no one got that it was a radio tower.
[01:16:01.511 --> 01:16:04.151]  It's a radio tower from clip art.
[01:16:04.151 --> 01:16:05.651]  It's the American flag.
[01:16:05.651 --> 01:16:07.312]  Look at the stripes.
[01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:08.752]  I guess you could argue it's a cultic.
[01:16:08.752 --> 01:16:12.333]  I guess everything is.
[01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:15.033]  In fact, Phil, I wasn't going to cover this because I thought about it last night.
[01:16:15.033 --> 01:16:16.774]  I just remembered it while the caller was talking.
[01:16:17.952 --> 01:16:20.614]  I remember you showing me different towers and asking which one I wanted.
[01:16:20.614 --> 01:16:21.594]  Oh, that's the other thing.
[01:16:21.594 --> 01:16:25.336]  They think those are upside down crosses in there and pentagrams.
[01:16:25.336 --> 01:16:32.261]  So, will you go search the original clip art you got that from and even, we'll put it on screen and show people when you find it.
[01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:33.421]  You drew that tower.
[01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:34.702]  Okay, well, I saw similar ones.
[01:16:34.702 --> 01:16:37.064]  Oh, so you are the agent.
[01:16:37.064 --> 01:16:39.105]  You are in here.
[01:16:39.105 --> 01:16:40.766]  Oh my gosh.
[01:16:40.766 --> 01:16:42.167]  Phil is so evil.
[01:16:42.167 --> 01:16:43.567]  Ah, there you go, an infiltrator.
[01:16:43.567 --> 01:16:44.148]  I'm joking, Phil.
[01:16:45.492 --> 01:16:48.614]  I remember him showing me different towers, I'm like, I like this one, I like that one.
[01:16:48.614 --> 01:16:54.336]  But the point is, so there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, pure, absolute proof of our evil.
[01:16:54.336 --> 01:16:57.678]  No, it's not a pyramid, it's a radio tower.
[01:16:57.678 --> 01:17:01.020]  And the symbol is, it's broadcasting across the world.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.001]  Now show some more of these devil towers, look.
[01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.955]  Yeah, click on that black one over there on the right-hand corner.
[01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:07.216]  It's a good one.
[01:17:07.216 --> 01:17:09.178]  Oh, look, it has Nazi symbols.
[01:17:09.178 --> 01:17:11.161]  Everyone has Nazi symbols on their towers.
[01:17:11.161 --> 01:17:18.309]  No, the symbol of electricity coming out of a tower has always been the symbol for electricity.
[01:17:18.309 --> 01:17:20.131]  It's always been the symbol for broadcasting.
[01:17:20.131 --> 01:17:20.732]  Click on that one.
[01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:25.724]  That's somebody else's, I guess that's what you're saying you designed it off of, it just wasn't big enough.
[01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:33.649]  So Phil took that, it wasn't a big enough image, so he remade it, and oh my gosh, you could say there's crosses on it!
[01:17:35.305 --> 01:17:37.126]  And an all-seeing eye at the top!
[01:17:37.126 --> 01:17:38.827]  And look, Nazi lightning bolts!
[01:17:38.827 --> 01:17:39.388]  It's the proof!
[01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:40.028]  No!
[01:17:40.028 --> 01:17:42.630]  It's the symbol of a radio tower!
[01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:44.931]  How could anyone look at this?
[01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:46.672]  And here's the other issue.
[01:17:46.672 --> 01:17:49.273]  I've now responded to it, which I don't care.
[01:17:49.273 --> 01:17:49.834]  I don't mind.
[01:17:49.834 --> 01:17:52.635]  More fake controversy actually just sends us more listeners.
[01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:54.016]  That's God's little secret.
[01:17:54.016 --> 01:17:58.298]  All the false attacks, all the misunderstandings, all the COINTELPRO, all the jealousy.
[01:17:58.298 --> 01:18:00.059]  I'm not saying this guy's like that.
[01:18:00.059 --> 01:18:00.500]  It only
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.421]  Listen, we're completely out of everybody else's league.
[01:18:04.421 --> 01:18:09.383]  We're in the same league in overall reaching numbers of people as Glenn Beck, okay?
[01:18:09.383 --> 01:18:12.165]  But we are truly alternative media, and people know that.
[01:18:12.165 --> 01:18:17.267]  So there is just outrageous, just complete jealousy.
[01:18:17.267 --> 01:18:24.330]  I was also reading the comments last night while I was watching the video or listening to it, and they were saying, why hasn't he responded?
[01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.991]  Why hasn't, it was just over, why hasn't he responded yet?
[01:18:26.991 --> 01:18:28.772]  You're lucky I even happened to see it!
[01:18:29.673 --> 01:18:35.177]  There are probably a thousand YouTube videos a day, conservatively, about Alex Jones, separate from what we do.
[01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.317]  Literally.
[01:18:36.317 --> 01:18:40.620]  If you go search YouTube for how many Alex Jones movies, it's something like 55 million.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.942]  I mean, I forget the number, last time I searched it.
[01:18:42.942 --> 01:18:44.403]  You know, searches that come up for it.
[01:18:44.403 --> 01:18:49.786]  I mean, you think, but luckily I happened to see this, and it's like, why hasn't he responded?
[01:18:49.786 --> 01:18:50.327]  Oh my God!
[01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:55.611]  Yeah, that's why I exposed Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[01:18:55.611 --> 01:18:58.794]  But let's just say I was Illuminati, okay?
[01:18:58.794 --> 01:19:00.596]  Let's just say I was.
[01:19:00.596 --> 01:19:04.340]  That's a distraction from what are you gonna do about this?
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.022]  I tell you, you have power.
[01:19:06.022 --> 01:19:07.764]  I tell you, you can affect change.
[01:19:07.764 --> 01:19:10.688]  I tell you, don't abort your babies, how great babies are.
[01:19:10.688 --> 01:19:12.850]  I tell you, don't drink poison water.
[01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:13.511]  Do you?
[01:19:13.511 --> 01:19:13.631]  No.
[01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:17.632]  I'll tell you who's Illuminati, or fellow travelers, or useful idiots of them.
[01:19:17.632 --> 01:19:27.233]  It's all the people whose websites and radio shows spend all day critiquing everybody else who's at the grassroots, instead of dealing with the New World Order.
[01:19:27.233 --> 01:19:41.036]  Instead of reaching new people, it becomes like a junior high free-for-all, with everyone arguing and gossiping about, you know, the captain of the football team, Alex Jones, and how bad he is, and how he cheated on Becky.
[01:19:41.636 --> 01:19:45.860]  Or how Alex, the captain of the football team, got seen, you know, drinking a beer.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.882]  You know, I mean, I mean, it's insane.
[01:19:47.882 --> 01:19:49.844]  Folks, this tyranny's real.
[01:19:49.844 --> 01:19:54.548]  We've got to unify against the globalists and the real Illuminati, the Luciferians.
[01:19:54.548 --> 01:19:55.609]  You understand that?
[01:19:55.609 --> 01:19:56.290]  We'll be right back.

[01:20:57.026 --> 01:20:57.787]  Check them out today.
[01:21:00.413 --> 01:21:04.517]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:21:04.517 --> 01:21:09.022]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:21:09.022 --> 01:21:15.188]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:21:15.188 --> 01:21:17.611]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:23.557]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:21:23.697 --> 01:21:27.101]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:21:27.101 --> 01:21:28.983]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:21:28.983 --> 01:21:31.166]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:21:31.166 --> 01:21:36.052]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[01:21:47.122 --> 01:21:47.823]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:02.650]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:04.692]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[01:22:04.692 --> 01:22:05.592]  debt crises.
[01:22:05.592 --> 01:22:06.633]  You heard me right.
[01:22:06.633 --> 01:22:09.096]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:12.759]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:12.759 --> 01:22:19.626]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:22:20.126 --> 01:22:21.387]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:21.387 --> 01:22:28.570]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:35.994]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:22:36.394 --> 01:22:40.356]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:22:40.356 --> 01:22:46.239]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:22:46.239 --> 01:22:52.542]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:22:52.542 --> 01:22:54.963]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[01:22:54.963 --> 01:22:55.243]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.628 --> 01:23:03.532]  I'm concerned about food for my family in the event of an emergency.
[01:23:03.532 --> 01:23:05.474]  And I know you are too.
[01:23:05.474 --> 01:23:06.515]  Are you ready?
[01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:08.476]  Don't wait for an emergency to happen.
[01:23:08.476 --> 01:23:13.081]  Put a plan together now with quality dehydrated food from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:23:13.081 --> 01:23:19.627]  For nearly 40 years, Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation canning the finest in dehydrated foods.
[01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:21.649]  Other companies just broker canned foods.

[01:23:48.676 --> 01:23:49.517]  Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:23:49.517 --> 01:23:50.217]  Factory Direct.
[01:23:50.217 --> 01:23:50.677]  Wholesale Pricing.
[01:24:04.369 --> 01:24:12.654]  Okay, let's get back into your calls and Time Magazine talks about the prospect of civil war doesn't seem that far-fetched in the U.S.
[01:24:12.654 --> 01:24:14.234]  They are really hyping this.
[01:24:14.234 --> 01:24:16.896]  They've been gearing up to crush a civil war.
[01:24:16.896 --> 01:24:17.836]  That's their plan.
[01:24:17.836 --> 01:24:21.078]  So the question is, how do we take our country back without that happening?
[01:24:21.078 --> 01:24:23.900]  We peacefully take the legislatures, the towns, the counties back.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:32.745]  We take the Congress back, we have criminal investigations of the bankers, we expose them, and we continue to expose provocateurs and stage terror.
[01:24:32.745 --> 01:24:33.846]  That's one way to do it.
[01:24:33.846 --> 01:24:35.947]  That's the basic solution right there.
[01:24:35.947 --> 01:24:39.449]  Joel and PA, then Austin, Roger, Mortis, and others.
[01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:41.511]  Joel, you're on the air.
[01:24:41.511 --> 01:24:44.132]  Hey Alex, I'm a long-time listener and full-time Infowarrior.
[01:24:44.132 --> 01:24:46.654]  It's been a few months since I last called in.
[01:24:46.654 --> 01:24:49.636]  I just got one comment and one question.
[01:24:49.636 --> 01:24:49.916]  Go ahead.
[01:24:50.791 --> 01:24:57.075]  I see a lot of people who are awake and trying to awaken others come down with battle fatigue and the info war.
[01:24:57.075 --> 01:25:00.578]  They get discouraged because they can't seem to get through to some people.
[01:25:00.578 --> 01:25:01.739]  They start to get pessimistic.
[01:25:01.739 --> 01:25:02.439]  Move on!
[01:25:02.439 --> 01:25:03.000]  Move on!
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.921]  Don't waste your time with laughing zombies.
[01:25:04.921 --> 01:25:05.541]  Plant the seed.
[01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:06.722]  Move on.
[01:25:06.722 --> 01:25:13.967]  Yeah, they get this defeatist attitude like the globals are invincible, but we gotta stay optimistic and look at all the victories we're having.
[01:25:13.967 --> 01:25:17.670]  I mean, as we all know, there's a huge global awakening taking place.
[01:25:18.288 --> 01:25:22.309]  Everywhere, and people are starting to resist this oppression, and it's accelerating.
[01:25:22.309 --> 01:25:29.191]  The majority of Americans now know that the Federal Reserve is a private holding company for offshore banks.
[01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:31.852]  We had a major victory with the Climategate emails.
[01:25:31.852 --> 01:25:39.133]  You and Ron Paul are becoming more and more mainstream every day because you guys were telling the truth all these years, and now you're being proven right.
[01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:45.135]  So I think it's important for everyone to stay optimistic and to keep the winning attitude because we're going to win this in the end.
[01:25:45.865 --> 01:25:54.227]  Well, I agree with you, Joel, and even more important, we need to explain to everybody who works for the system, look, you're going to be hurt in this as well.
[01:25:54.227 --> 01:25:55.747]  You're not immune from this.
[01:25:55.747 --> 01:26:03.489]  And it's we the people, 99% of us, against a tiny ruling class who is completely criminal and illegitimate.
[01:26:03.489 --> 01:26:06.029]  And we've got to come together and keep getting the word out.
[01:26:06.029 --> 01:26:07.569]  Now's the time to get the word out.
[01:26:07.569 --> 01:26:10.250]  What does Cass Sunstein at the White House say in public memos?
[01:26:11.294 --> 01:26:16.579]  That they send out fake conspiracy theorists on the web to get us in fighting with each other.
[01:26:16.579 --> 01:26:24.187]  Because as long as we're fighting with each other and debating mindless garbage, we're not going to move forward in waking new people up.
[01:26:24.187 --> 01:26:27.890]  The system is scared, as Zbigniew Brzezinski said four months ago, and I appreciate your call.
[01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:32.755]  He said this is the first time in human history ever that the entire of humanity
[01:26:33.723 --> 01:26:39.726]  And that means generally, you know, the entire of humanity is awake and staring at the elite, and is politically aware.
[01:26:39.726 --> 01:26:46.949]  Okay, people know it's the private banks that run the planet, not puppet Obama, not puppet Bush, and that ain't gonna work anymore.
[01:26:46.949 --> 01:26:50.050]  They know Nicolas Sarkozy's a pimp.
[01:26:50.050 --> 01:26:54.192]  They know that all these leaders are just frontmen, they're pimps.
[01:26:55.259 --> 01:26:56.379]  Okay?
[01:26:56.379 --> 01:27:01.000]  And they're pimping us out, and people know that now, and that's a big problem for the globalists.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.721]  We see them now.
[01:27:02.721 --> 01:27:05.881]  Their denial doesn't work anymore.
[01:27:05.881 --> 01:27:07.462]  Let's talk to Austin in Ohio.
[01:27:07.462 --> 01:27:09.982]  Austin, you're on the air.
[01:27:09.982 --> 01:27:11.142]  Hello, Alex.
[01:27:11.142 --> 01:27:12.383]  Welcome.
[01:27:12.383 --> 01:27:14.103]  Great to talk to you.
[01:27:14.103 --> 01:27:18.404]  I have what I would call an info nuke to drop on you, okay?
[01:27:18.404 --> 01:27:20.605]  Okay.
[01:27:20.605 --> 01:27:20.985]  All right.
[01:27:23.243 --> 01:27:27.164]  The story about what happened in the Gulf is not over, that's what I would say.
[01:27:27.164 --> 01:27:35.307]  Oh, we've been posting videos of just thousands of dead fish, koregs everywhere, but Obama says koregs isn't bad for him.
[01:27:35.307 --> 01:27:52.272]  Anybody that eats Gulf seafood might end up dead, and it's all on BP's... Anyway, I will... I hope that this will be like the new search term for the day, and millions and millions of people will see the truth about what happened there.
[01:27:53.243 --> 01:28:05.848]  So, I want to point everyone's attention to MarineLog.com and an article that they posted on September 2nd, 2009.
[01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:11.510]  So, seven months before the horrible thing on 4-20-2010.
[01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:21.935]  The headline is, again, this is MarineLog Docs and News Mix or something.
[01:28:21.935 --> 01:28:22.775]  Okay, I'm just going to read it.
[01:28:23.945 --> 01:28:25.706]  September 2nd, 2009.
[01:28:25.706 --> 01:28:30.428]  TransOcean Submersible sets drilling depth record.
[01:28:30.428 --> 01:28:31.708]  That's the headline.
[01:28:31.708 --> 01:28:51.876]  Then, underneath it, it says, TransOcean Limited today announced that its Ultra Deep Water Submersible Rig, Deep Water Horizon, we've all heard of that, recently drilled the deepest oil and gas well ever while working for BP and its co-owners
[01:28:52.421 --> 01:28:54.243]  On the Tiber Well in the U.S.
[01:28:54.243 --> 01:28:55.463]  Gulf of Mexico.
[01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:59.687]  This is the one that we all have heard about that we saw gushing and gushing and gushing.
[01:28:59.687 --> 01:29:01.208]  Okay.
[01:29:01.208 --> 01:29:12.657]  Okay, anyway, from there it says, um, uh, the trans-ocean crews on the Deepwater Horizon drilled the well to 35,050 feet vertical depth.
[01:29:16.152 --> 01:29:17.073]  Okay, so what's the big news?
[01:29:17.073 --> 01:29:17.994]  I mean, I know about that.
[01:29:37.409 --> 01:29:38.810]  I mean, that just didn't make sense.
[01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:42.654]  I mean, when was there for... Yeah, it's... it's... it's... abiotic.
[01:29:42.654 --> 01:29:43.194]  Stay there.
[01:29:43.194 --> 01:29:45.496]  Briefly finish up with your bombshell info.
[01:29:45.496 --> 01:29:47.398]  I wanna see where this is going, Austin.
[01:29:47.398 --> 01:29:51.501]  And then we're gonna talk to a lot of other callers.
[01:29:51.501 --> 01:29:52.902]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.902 --> 01:29:55.424]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.424 --> 01:29:58.107]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.212 --> 01:30:05.414]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:05.414 --> 01:30:11.817]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:11.817 --> 01:30:19.200]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.742]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:30:24.062 --> 01:30:32.736]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:30:32.736 --> 01:30:36.462]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:43.766]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:30:43.766 --> 01:30:47.669]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:54.034]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:30:54.034 --> 01:30:54.815]  Thank you.
[01:31:01.872 --> 01:31:17.349]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:17.349 --> 01:31:21.033]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:22.031 --> 01:31:34.803]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:34.803 --> 01:31:42.070]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:42.751 --> 01:31:53.116]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:31:53.116 --> 01:31:57.038]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:31:57.038 --> 01:32:00.160]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:05.281]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.281 --> 01:32:06.181]  Number one.
[01:32:06.181 --> 01:32:09.602]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.602 --> 01:32:10.462]  Number two.
[01:32:10.462 --> 01:32:15.363]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.103]  It's true.
[01:32:16.103 --> 01:32:20.964]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.964 --> 01:32:21.804]  Number three.
[01:32:21.804 --> 01:32:25.385]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.385 --> 01:32:29.086]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.286 --> 01:32:30.086]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:32.848]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.848 --> 01:32:36.529]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.529 --> 01:32:37.329]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.329 --> 01:32:41.471]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.471 --> 01:32:46.513]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.513 --> 01:32:50.695]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.695 --> 01:32:52.476]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.476 --> 01:32:57.078]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:59.819 --> 01:33:10.882]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:10.882 --> 01:33:12.242]  Alright, I want to try to race through your calls.
[01:33:12.242 --> 01:33:14.443]  We've got a guest coming up for two hours in studio.
[01:33:18.263 --> 01:33:19.983]  And I'm going on RT right at the end of the show.
[01:33:19.983 --> 01:33:21.644]  It never ends.
[01:33:21.644 --> 01:33:39.867]  Yes, Austin, there's a lot of evidence and many more scientists and petroleum geologists are saying that most oil is not produced by dead plant and animal matter, or the oil, the essence of dead dinos, but that it's being produced down on the earth.
[01:33:39.867 --> 01:33:42.928]  And they've seen this all over the world with even hundred-year-old oil wells.
[01:33:44.155 --> 01:33:48.496]  Okay, um, well, the point is, so I go and I look to see, I mean, six miles underneath the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:33:48.496 --> 01:33:49.576]  So this is continental crust.
[01:33:49.576 --> 01:33:49.896]  This is not
[01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:20.359]  Um, you know, this is not normal crust, like if you'd go underneath, um, a high mountain or something.
[01:34:20.359 --> 01:34:22.120]  Yeah, this is not alluvial crust.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.782]  We're getting now, you know, down to close to the mantle.
[01:34:24.782 --> 01:34:25.222]  Go ahead.
[01:34:25.222 --> 01:34:27.904]  So what's your big, incredible bombshell info?
[01:34:27.904 --> 01:34:29.845]  That's exactly the point, Alex.
[01:34:29.845 --> 01:34:36.790]  The reason it just kept gushing and gushing is because the mantle is liquid and they drill down six feet.
[01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:39.112]  If you look up the continental crust, meaning
[01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:46.535]  You know, under ocean, they say that the average continental cross-section is three to six miles.
[01:34:46.535 --> 01:34:49.757]  So what they did is they just drilled all the way down.
[01:34:49.757 --> 01:34:52.778]  I mean, this was criminal, right?
[01:34:52.778 --> 01:35:00.983]  They drilled all the way down into the liquid mantle, which, because the Earth spins, it goes through centrifugal force.
[01:35:01.596 --> 01:35:06.820]  And therefore, that's why the liquid stuff was just gushing and gushing and gushing.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:17.167]  Well, to be specific, they think the, they believe the core may spin, but not the mantle, but though there is a lot of molten stuff going on in the mantle.
[01:35:17.167 --> 01:35:19.189]  I mean, the Earth spins every day.
[01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.589]  We see it.
[01:35:19.589 --> 01:35:23.492]  I mean, you know, that's why the sun rises and falls is because the Earth spins.
[01:35:23.914 --> 01:35:30.437]  And it doesn't make a difference to us, but when you're a liquid in the center and around it.
[01:35:30.437 --> 01:35:34.159]  So what is the huge breaking news?
[01:35:34.159 --> 01:35:35.240]  Well, that's it.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.300]  They all they did.
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:50.507]  I mean, the reason that it gushed for months was because it was just they drilled into the mantle and then took all the oil that was coming out of it or whatever you want to call the stuff that is the mantle.
[01:35:50.507 --> 01:35:52.508]  They were taking it for about seven months.
[01:35:52.904 --> 01:36:00.510]  And then they destroyed their own well to create a huge catastrophe that would kill millions of people.
[01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:03.313]  Well, to be specific, they were working on completing the well.
[01:36:03.313 --> 01:36:05.635]  Just because they drilled down didn't mean it was completed.
[01:36:05.635 --> 01:36:08.677]  They have to case it and go through a bunch of different activities.
[01:36:08.677 --> 01:36:11.380]  They were having a lot of trouble doing it for months.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:13.822]  But that is important and we have actually covered that, Austin.
[01:36:13.822 --> 01:36:14.702]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:19.110 --> 01:36:22.751]  That's the issue of science going crazy.
[01:36:22.751 --> 01:36:28.832]  They're telling you, we need to tax you because your carbon dioxide that plants respirate from is deadly poison.
[01:36:28.832 --> 01:36:35.393]  But then they're not worried about genetic engineering or antimatter weapons or the CERN superconducting supercollider.
[01:36:35.393 --> 01:36:39.534]  They're not worried about, you know, all these other super weapons they're developing.
[01:36:39.534 --> 01:36:43.635]  And they've just got thousands of giant research government, private and university facilities
[01:36:45.066 --> 01:36:55.119]  Doing pure research just to see what's going to happen and they admit their own permutations with the case with CERN that it could create a strangelet or a black hole.
[01:36:55.119 --> 01:37:03.770]  A whole bunch of different permutations and equations show it could cause something that could destroy the planet or even blow the whole solar system to kingdom come or suck it into a black hole.
[01:37:05.418 --> 01:37:15.844]  You want to see a movie example of it, it'd be like the last Star Trek, you know, where the bad guys go and, you know, drop a bit of this antimatter into the core of the planet and it sucks into a black hole.
[01:37:15.844 --> 01:37:19.647]  That's basically what a strangelet would do.
[01:37:19.647 --> 01:37:29.013]  But, I mean, here is Reuters today, CERN scientist, eye parallel universe breakthrough, and they're looking for this magic particle.
[01:37:30.123 --> 01:37:41.269]  And so they're accelerating now, not just uranium into blocks of lead, they're accelerating uranium, plutonium, and other things at each other at light speed, running them into each other.
[01:37:41.269 --> 01:37:48.073]  They're not running particles they spin up into a block of lead or whatever they're testing to find out about the nature of the universe.
[01:37:48.073 --> 01:37:51.896]  They're taking particles themselves and accelerating them at each other.
[01:37:51.896 --> 01:37:55.738]  Now, what makes an atomic explosion or a hydrogen explosion?
[01:37:57.153 --> 01:38:04.017]  They're taking those atoms and jamming them together and causing a chain reaction.
[01:38:04.017 --> 01:38:05.839]  And I read what these physicists at CERN say.
[01:38:05.839 --> 01:38:08.320]  They say, yeah, there's a small chance we'll destroy the Earth.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.101]  I mean, it goes back to the Manhattan Project.
[01:38:10.101 --> 01:38:18.746]  When they first tested the A-bomb, the majority of the scientists, wrongly, thought it was going to ignite the atmosphere and burn the atmosphere of the planet up.
[01:38:18.746 --> 01:38:19.607]  But they went ahead with it.
[01:38:21.525 --> 01:38:29.711]  So, the more of these experiments they do, in the thousands a year now, in all these different facilities, the more chances there are.
[01:38:29.711 --> 01:38:42.481]  And if they created what they call a strangelet, it would create a particle that would sink to the center of the Earth, and it would take years before it reached critical mass.
[01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:50.507]  And the way they describe it is, you'd have earthquakes for about two minutes by the time you figured out it was happening, and by the time it expanded to the next level, the whole planet would just be
[01:38:52.239 --> 01:38:56.300]  Sucked into a... You can pull up all the different types of things it can do.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:00.062]  I'm just giving over-generalizations here.
[01:39:00.062 --> 01:39:12.566]  Physicists probing the origins of the cosmos hope that next year there will be a turn up, the first proofs of existence of concepts long dear to science fiction writers, such as hidden worlds and extra dimensions, which the mathematics show are there.
[01:39:12.566 --> 01:39:14.687]  I mean, what's gonna happen?
[01:39:14.687 --> 01:39:15.587]  A gate's gonna open up?
[01:39:15.587 --> 01:39:17.128]  A hellraiser?
[01:39:17.128 --> 01:39:19.668]  Or an army of who knows what?
[01:39:19.668 --> 01:39:20.909]  I mean, who knows what's gonna happen?
[01:39:22.438 --> 01:39:25.041]  Or just another dimension opens up and swallows up our planet.
[01:39:25.041 --> 01:39:29.766]  That's what a lot of physicists think black holes are.
[01:39:29.766 --> 01:39:38.096]  And as their Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at CERN near Geneva moves into high gear, they are taking increasingly of the new physics.
[01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:43.851]  On the horizon that could totally change current views of the universe and how it works.
[01:39:43.851 --> 01:39:48.412]  Parallel universes, unknown forms of matter, extra dimensions.
[01:39:48.412 --> 01:39:56.414]  These are not the stuff of cheap science fiction, but the very concrete physics theories that scientists are trying to confirm with the LHC and other experiments.
[01:39:56.414 --> 01:40:02.956]  Now remember, the theory of atomic theorem, the atomic theory,
[01:40:04.127 --> 01:40:11.671]  The theory of atomic science was crystallized in 1900, 110 years ago, by physicist Max Planck.
[01:40:11.671 --> 01:40:19.115]  And the equations he drew on chalkboards, he predicted atomic weapons.
[01:40:19.115 --> 01:40:31.442]  Now, these guys with supercomputers and all this system, all these powerful systems, they are predicting and showing with their algorithms that they are going to open dimensional gates, the equivalent of Stargate.
[01:40:32.165 --> 01:40:35.068]  This is not science fiction, okay?
[01:40:35.068 --> 01:40:42.394]  Now, these people will end up destroying us if we don't get control of the situation.
[01:40:42.394 --> 01:40:49.500]  And the globalists are always saying, oh, we want world government to stop a nuclear war, to stop problems, meanwhile they hand out the weapons to everybody.
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:53.164]  Oh, we need a global government to stop bioweapons being developed that'll kill everybody.
[01:40:53.164 --> 01:40:56.166]  They built 36 level four bioweapons labs all over the U.S.
[01:40:56.166 --> 01:40:58.789]  in areas with level two containment in the middle of major cities.
[01:41:00.427 --> 01:41:02.950]  It's as if they want to destroy life.
[01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:07.194]  It's as if they're looking for a way to nihilistically annihilate our planet.
[01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:11.759]  And when you read the writings of some of the top futurists and transhumanists, that's all they talk about.
[01:41:11.759 --> 01:41:17.345]  They go, we're going to go on willing and go on building and go on exploring until we're gods or we're going to die trying.
[01:41:18.624 --> 01:41:22.705]  Life extension, super high-tech physics, all of this.
[01:41:22.705 --> 01:41:26.386]  That's why they're on power trips, acting like we don't count.
[01:41:26.386 --> 01:41:28.466]  Oh, let's go ahead and take everybody's pension funds.
[01:41:28.466 --> 01:41:32.027]  Let's go ahead and take six million dead and dying veterans' death benefits.
[01:41:32.027 --> 01:41:35.928]  Oh, let's go ahead and just, you know, flu shots are hurting people.
[01:41:35.928 --> 01:41:38.608]  They admit they are, but that's just the way.
[01:41:38.608 --> 01:41:41.309]  Used to, 20 years ago, they told troops, don't use DU.
[01:41:41.309 --> 01:41:43.289]  Now they say, here it is, it's great for you.
[01:41:43.289 --> 01:41:46.010]  It's like they know something we don't know.
[01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:46.810]  They don't care.
[01:41:49.437 --> 01:42:13.139]  It's like somebody running around a fireworks factory with giant piles of white and black gunpowder everywhere with huge torches with embers falling and they're just like laughing like a combination of Daffy Duck and Woody Woodpecker going, just insanely running around in the fireworks factory with these burning torches, embers falling right by the dynamite.
[01:42:18.915 --> 01:42:26.376]  And these people are completely insane, but they're crazy like a fox.
[01:42:26.376 --> 01:42:35.018]  And in their mad competition for technocratic godhood, let's say they discover many of these things that are seen by many as godlike powers.
[01:42:35.018 --> 01:42:44.619]  Somebody 10,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago, you showed them a hydrogen bomb going off at Bikini or out at Trinity, you better believe they'd think that was God.
[01:42:44.619 --> 01:42:47.180]  A cell phone is magic compared to people 100 years ago.
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.041]  Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:42:51.041 --> 01:42:53.563]  Not to mention the stuff they've already discovered and they're keeping from us.
[01:42:53.563 --> 01:42:55.484]  We know they keep most of it from us.
[01:42:55.484 --> 01:42:58.126]  So, they're running around on wild power trips.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:04.844]  The Vatican and the UN have appointed ambassadors for the alien landings they say are coming.
[01:43:04.844 --> 01:43:06.285]  I'm not the one covering this.
[01:43:06.285 --> 01:43:07.626]  They're the ones doing it.
[01:43:07.626 --> 01:43:09.327]  I'm not the weirdo talking about this.
[01:43:09.327 --> 01:43:11.528]  I'm reading you Reuters.
[01:43:11.528 --> 01:43:12.969]  Reuters!
[01:43:12.969 --> 01:43:14.870]  Reuters!
[01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:16.952]  And this is the stuff that keeps me up at night.
[01:43:16.952 --> 01:43:17.952]  I want to go on living.
[01:43:17.952 --> 01:43:19.634]  I like human society.
[01:43:19.634 --> 01:43:22.515]  I want my children to have great-great-grandchildren.
[01:43:22.515 --> 01:43:24.076]  I want to go to the stars.
[01:43:24.076 --> 01:43:29.120]  But we've got a bunch of crazy inbred nutcases on power trips running everything.
[01:43:34.636 --> 01:43:37.217]  This caller's called Aerosol Spring in Illinois.
[01:43:37.217 --> 01:43:39.118]  That's an inventive name.
[01:43:39.118 --> 01:43:43.380]  Go ahead, Aerosol, you're on the air.
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:50.464]  Quickly, before I get to that, people, InTouch.org, 20-week prayer to get back our country from repentance.
[01:43:50.464 --> 01:44:02.310]  Talks about great chapters in the Bible, books, talking about the war against Jesus, terrorism, the financial crisis, increasing taxation, Charlie Stanley, great preacher of the Lord.
[01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:03.111]  People look that up.
[01:44:04.392 --> 01:44:11.338]  Yeah, I'm here in Macomb and I'm sick and tired of seeing this aerosol, indirect and semi-direct aerosol campaign going on.
[01:44:11.338 --> 01:44:14.781]  If you look that up in Google, you'll find tremendous documents.
[01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:21.788]  Hundreds of thousands of universities, Department of Energy, foreign governments, a giant weather modification program going on.
[01:44:23.188 --> 01:44:33.543]  If you're in Illinois and you want to talk to someone about this, Greg McFarquhar from the University of Illinois, he's funded by the Department of Energy.
[01:44:33.543 --> 01:44:34.745]  This is disgusting.
[01:44:34.745 --> 01:44:37.710]  One of the CFR documents has a Boeing plane
[01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:41.251]  Uh, showing, uh, you know, exactly examples.
[01:44:41.251 --> 01:44:55.397]  They're mentioning it's not... No, no, the old-timers 15 years ago did the test and said they're spraying aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and sulfur, and now the government comes out and says, we've been testing it, but now we want to go operational and block out the sun for your safety.
[01:44:55.397 --> 01:45:01.559]  Barium salts, aluminum dioxide, and sulfur particles, exactly what the test showed.
[01:45:01.559 --> 01:45:03.740]  We just magically, 15 years ago,
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:10.358]  With so many great activists and researchers said exactly what it was and then magically it is that.
[01:45:11.232 --> 01:45:12.173]  One last thing, Alex.
[01:45:12.173 --> 01:45:13.593]  You're going on RT today.
[01:45:13.593 --> 01:45:19.337]  Can you plug the birth certificate march in Washington, D.C.?
[01:45:19.337 --> 01:45:20.917]  People, Google Obama crimes.
[01:45:20.917 --> 01:45:22.878]  It'll take you to Phil J. Berg's website.
[01:45:22.878 --> 01:45:24.119]  Let's get that number one.
[01:45:24.119 --> 01:45:24.559]  Yeah, I know.
[01:45:24.559 --> 01:45:25.940]  I mean, we're trying as hard as we can.
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:26.841]  We had him on yesterday.
[01:45:26.841 --> 01:45:27.841]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:27.841 --> 01:45:39.768]  You know, national media and international media doesn't tell me what to say, but they call up and they say, we're having you on about the fact that you say corporate governance is the new world order.
[01:45:41.508 --> 01:45:57.680]  And so, then if I start going on any shows and talk about something completely separate to what I've agreed to come on about, then they're not going to have me back on because it's kind of like if I had a guest on about superconducting super colliders.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.661]  And they came on and talked about Philberg's March.
[01:46:00.661 --> 01:46:02.021]  I mean, we plugged Philberg's March.
[01:46:02.021 --> 01:46:02.621]  We did it.
[01:46:02.621 --> 01:46:11.143]  I don't know if I could interject that in there, but I mean, I've been on our team many times exposing Obama as Barry Sotero, but I appreciate your call.
[01:46:11.143 --> 01:46:12.423]  Roger in New Hampshire.
[01:46:12.423 --> 01:46:14.383]  Roger, you're on the air.
[01:46:14.383 --> 01:46:15.284]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:15.284 --> 01:46:15.984]  Can you hear me?
[01:46:15.984 --> 01:46:17.424]  Yes, I can.
[01:46:17.424 --> 01:46:17.844]  Okay.
[01:46:17.844 --> 01:46:22.745]  I know you covered, like, the pension stuff, and this is a similar situation.
[01:46:22.745 --> 01:46:27.086]  You know, I got laid off recently, and I tried to be responsible.
[01:46:27.642 --> 01:46:29.604]  Put some money away in an FSA.
[01:46:29.604 --> 01:46:31.646]  You know what that is, right?
[01:46:31.646 --> 01:46:34.688]  Tax Savings Account?
[01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:49.001]  Well, they're telling me that, um, I can't touch the money because I'm no longer an employee, but I had no... I had no reason to... Yeah, I can tell you're upset.
[01:46:49.001 --> 01:46:50.282]  This is happening everywhere.
[01:46:50.282 --> 01:46:54.726]  Uh, they lay you off, and then for five, ten years, how long has you worked there?
[01:46:55.896 --> 01:46:58.498]  I worked with this company for about seven years.
[01:47:25.776 --> 01:47:26.416]  Yeah.
[01:47:26.416 --> 01:47:28.718]  So, so what are these people telling you?
[01:47:28.718 --> 01:47:39.924]  Um, they're saying that if I, you know, if I'd been to the doctor earlier before my layoff date, I could file a claim against that, but I had no reason to think that I would be laid off.
[01:47:39.924 --> 01:47:42.046]  They were, all this company was pretty busy.
[01:47:42.046 --> 01:47:50.531]  But wait a minute, you're saying you, they took money out of your check for the pension and many companies make you do this and then they're not giving you your money.
[01:47:50.531 --> 01:47:52.752]  It was for a flex savings account and granted,
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.365]  Yes, I signed up for it and I feel like a chump.
[01:47:56.365 --> 01:48:03.455]  But, you know, I signed up for it with the expectation that if I went to a doctor and whatever, whatever it was...
[01:48:04.059 --> 01:48:06.580]  No, I just wanted to say that it's not just the pensions that they're stealing.
[01:48:32.665 --> 01:48:35.507]  Similar, but it's not just the pensions that these companies are stealing.
[01:48:35.507 --> 01:48:38.990]  So they told you this was a medical care account?
[01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:44.015]  Right, a flax savings account for things that aren't covered by this high-priced, stupid policy, you know?
[01:48:44.015 --> 01:48:49.079]  And it was a savings account with your money, and they say, sorry, it's ours now!
[01:48:49.079 --> 01:48:51.461]  You pretty much.
[01:48:51.461 --> 01:48:58.227]  You know, I'm just angry, I just wanted to... I know it's partly my greed, because I tried to... by putting it in an FSA, it's...
[01:48:58.786 --> 01:49:00.967]  It's basically a tax shelter for the working poor.
[01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:03.508]  So it's partly... Yeah, but this is theft!
[01:49:03.508 --> 01:49:04.488]  I mean, this is theft!
[01:49:04.488 --> 01:49:14.352]  You put it in a medical savings account, and that's just like an education savings account or anything else, and this, you know, that company probably already, you know, took that money as bonuses out the back door.
[01:49:14.352 --> 01:49:17.833]  Don't just listen to them tell you, oh, we're taking your house.
[01:49:17.833 --> 01:49:19.654]  You're like, but I'm not behind in payments.
[01:49:19.654 --> 01:49:21.015]  You don't even have the deed.
[01:49:21.015 --> 01:49:22.035]  Shut up!
[01:49:22.035 --> 01:49:23.856]  You know, you need to learn how to counter them.
[01:49:23.856 --> 01:49:26.917]  I've got a sneaking suspicion that this is all basically a bluff.
[01:49:27.517 --> 01:49:28.257]  Well, well...
[01:49:44.881 --> 01:49:48.563]  Well, it's only from year to year, so like January 1st, you have to start over again.
[01:50:14.981 --> 01:50:24.284]  I mean, you know, certainly you've been robbed a bit, but that's nothing compared to the Frenchies and, you know, others being told, oh, we got 80% taxes.
[01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:28.626]  Oh, you've been paying into that pension fund your whole life, you know, most of your paycheck.
[01:50:28.626 --> 01:50:29.566]  Guess what?
[01:50:29.566 --> 01:50:33.808]  We're going to cut that money massively.
[01:50:33.808 --> 01:50:36.849]  It's all going to the private central bank's interest.
[01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:38.770]  Oh, you don't like it?
[01:50:38.770 --> 01:50:39.771]  You're gonna protest?
[01:50:39.771 --> 01:50:42.512]  Uh, and they whistle and bring over some young thugs.
[01:50:42.512 --> 01:50:46.234]  Break a few things for the news cameras so we can sick the police on this old man.
[01:50:46.234 --> 01:50:49.435]  The old man's like, but I'm just here protesting.
[01:50:49.435 --> 01:50:51.296]  We're gonna break your skull, old man.
[01:50:51.296 --> 01:50:52.416]  We work for the bankers.
[01:50:52.416 --> 01:50:54.057]  We murdered a million Iraqis.
[01:50:54.057 --> 01:50:55.357]  We're ruthless killers.
[01:50:55.357 --> 01:50:57.078]  We put poisons in vaccines.
[01:50:57.078 --> 01:50:58.299]  What do you expect from us?
[01:50:58.299 --> 01:50:59.419]  We're taking your money.
[01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:00.580]  Stick them up, old man!
[01:51:01.428 --> 01:51:02.729]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.729 --> 01:51:08.333]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.333 --> 01:51:13.336]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.336 --> 01:51:13.816]  It's true.
[01:51:13.816 --> 01:51:18.920]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:20.741]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:21.001 --> 01:51:21.521]  We're good to go!
[01:51:49.045 --> 01:51:52.007]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:52.007 --> 01:51:58.111]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.111 --> 01:52:01.092]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.092 --> 01:52:04.474]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.474 --> 01:52:08.377]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.377 --> 01:52:12.099]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:12.099 --> 01:52:17.022]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[01:52:17.302 --> 01:52:17.542]  I think?

[01:53:51.185 --> 01:53:51.885]  That's 1-800-875-4254 today!
[01:54:16.397 --> 01:54:28.083]  See, when they talk about rioting all over the country that's already going on all over Europe, they're saying in Time Magazine, because the militias, because the Tea Parties are bad,
[01:54:29.181 --> 01:54:30.101]  It's their fault.
[01:54:30.101 --> 01:54:32.963]  It's their fault you're losing your Social Security COLA.
[01:54:32.963 --> 01:54:41.687]  It's their fault the White House Commission and Congress are proposing raising the retirement age and taking part of your private pension funds.
[01:54:41.687 --> 01:54:45.609]  It's those of us that are angry at the banks for doing this.
[01:54:45.609 --> 01:54:46.549]  It's our fault.
[01:54:46.549 --> 01:54:54.653]  And Time Magazine and others say, thank goodness the Army is standing by, standing by to protect us from all of this.
[01:54:55.934 --> 01:54:59.558]  Oh, the army just came up with a plan to suppress civil unrest.
[01:54:59.558 --> 01:55:00.979]  They just did it this week.
[01:55:00.979 --> 01:55:06.885]  They haven't been secretly training for decades for this, setting all this up.
[01:55:06.885 --> 01:55:10.529]  This is the world government takeover taking place right now.
[01:55:10.529 --> 01:55:13.652]  And it's all covered in endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:55:13.652 --> 01:55:14.373]  It's all covered.
[01:55:16.644 --> 01:55:20.425]  In fall of the Republic, people are ready to see this information.
[01:55:20.425 --> 01:55:26.126]  And not only do the books and videos and materials wake others up, it also supports our operation.
[01:55:26.126 --> 01:55:40.850]  And we couldn't have done any of this without you, so I want to thank everybody that does visit the online video bookstore with all the t-shirts and the wristbands and all the material we've got to spread the word, the Citizen Rule books, all of your purchases of the books, the tapes, the videos.
[01:55:40.850 --> 01:55:42.290]  It makes this radio show possible.
[01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:44.312]  And we're going to be shipping very, very soon.
[01:55:44.312 --> 01:55:45.674]  It's about to be released.
[01:55:45.674 --> 01:55:46.895]  What in the world are they spraying?
[01:55:46.895 --> 01:55:48.638]  Dealing with the chemtrails.
[01:55:48.638 --> 01:55:49.379]  Enemy of the state.
[01:55:49.379 --> 01:55:50.700]  Dealing with their martial law.
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:51.742]  Smokescreen plans.
[01:55:51.742 --> 01:55:52.803]  How they plan to implement it.
[01:55:52.803 --> 01:55:54.065]  Some of the different scenarios there.
[01:55:54.065 --> 01:55:57.229]  And how this whole homeland security system is for you, the American people.
[01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:58.490]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[01:55:58.490 --> 01:56:00.493]  Same exact continuity of agenda.
[01:56:01.434 --> 01:56:03.675]  Those two new films about to come out this week.
[01:56:03.675 --> 01:56:05.556]  Shipping them to you on DVD.
[01:56:05.556 --> 01:56:08.877]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:08.877 --> 01:56:13.699]  We're going to ship them out in the order that they are received.
[01:56:13.699 --> 01:56:14.819]  888-253-3139.
[01:56:14.819 --> 01:56:21.402]  And I sure would like to fill up that whole radio tower at Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:56:21.402 --> 01:56:22.422]  I sure would like to get up
[01:56:22.802 --> 01:56:22.882]  Yeah.
[01:56:44.543 --> 01:56:56.613]  And to be able to expand and at least finish the TV production studios and the films we're making in the face of this, because what we're doing is reaching hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people.
[01:56:56.613 --> 01:57:04.539]  One YouTube channel we've got, of about, I think about eight, has 70 million views in two years.
[01:57:04.539 --> 01:57:06.080]  One channel, 70 million views.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:09.023]  This radio show, 2 million live listeners a day, conservatively.
[01:57:10.014 --> 01:57:12.436]  The websites, millions of visitors a day.
[01:57:12.436 --> 01:57:16.580]  Our information is breaking out and being covered by the Drudge Report.
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:18.562]  You know, the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[01:57:18.562 --> 01:57:20.184]  Drudge links to us, we appreciate that.
[01:57:20.184 --> 01:57:25.169]  The others are attacking us, but that also sends new people to find what we're actually covering and talking about.
[01:57:26.041 --> 01:57:29.024]  We are fearlessly going into uncharted waters.
[01:57:29.024 --> 01:57:36.170]  There is no one in our league, no one even close but Ron Paul, when it comes to getting information out on the international level.
[01:57:36.170 --> 01:57:38.212]  I talked to business people and people in the military.
[01:57:38.212 --> 01:57:45.519]  They said they can be in Japan, they can be in Germany, they can be in the Czech Republic, they can be in Venezuela, they can be in Brazil.
[01:57:45.519 --> 01:57:50.723]  Everywhere people know who Alex Jones is and that isn't, oh look, people know who I am, oh boy.
[01:57:50.723 --> 01:57:52.325]  No, that's scary, I actually don't like it.
[01:57:53.612 --> 01:57:57.874]  Physically, individually, but it is a signifier.
[01:57:57.874 --> 01:57:58.774]  It is a signet.
[01:57:58.774 --> 01:57:59.695]  It is an indicator.
[01:57:59.695 --> 01:58:02.356]  It is a huge, flashing, neon sign.
[01:58:02.356 --> 01:58:03.377]  You're on the right track.
[01:58:03.377 --> 01:58:04.537]  You're on the right track.
[01:58:04.537 --> 01:58:06.218]  You're having a big effect.
[01:58:06.218 --> 01:58:10.940]  It's a sonar ping that we are having a giant effect.
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:12.001]  People say, how do you do it every day?
[01:58:12.001 --> 01:58:16.243]  How do you do interviews in three hours, four hours on the radio, six days a week on the air?
[01:58:16.243 --> 01:58:17.183]  How do you make films?
[01:58:17.183 --> 01:58:18.484]  How do you do it all?
[01:58:18.484 --> 01:58:20.805]  Self-built, self-funded by you.
[01:58:21.525 --> 01:58:22.566]  Working with us.
[01:58:22.566 --> 01:58:24.807]  Because I know it's real!
[01:58:24.807 --> 01:58:27.868]  I don't just say they're poisoning the water to sterilize us and give us cancer.
[01:58:27.868 --> 01:58:29.109]  I have their documents.
[01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:31.410]  I don't just say they're adding sterilize to vaccines.
[01:58:31.410 --> 01:58:32.951]  I have the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:58:32.951 --> 01:58:34.392]  This is a nightmare!
[01:58:34.392 --> 01:58:36.733]  All I could do is stand up and fight this.
[01:58:36.733 --> 01:58:37.774]  I think I'm sane.
[01:58:37.774 --> 01:58:39.274]  A lot of other folks are nuts.
[01:58:39.274 --> 01:58:44.277]  How could you not fight this?
[01:58:44.277 --> 01:58:45.658]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.658 --> 01:58:48.439]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.576 --> 01:58:55.159]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:58:55.159 --> 01:58:56.460]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:59:00.864]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:59:00.864 --> 01:59:06.810]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:59:06.810 --> 01:59:08.951]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:11.634]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:59:11.974 --> 01:59:18.479]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:59:18.479 --> 01:59:20.681]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:59:20.681 --> 01:59:26.025]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:59:26.025 --> 01:59:31.309]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:59:31.309 --> 01:59:36.493]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:59:36.673 --> 01:59:39.855]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[01:59:43.877 --> 01:59:45.118]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.118 --> 01:59:47.039]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.141 --> 02:00:10.964]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.964 --> 02:00:12.564]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.564 --> 02:00:14.105]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.105 --> 02:00:18.287]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.287 --> 02:00:22.349]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.174 --> 02:00:38.470]  Okay, I had told Randy Kelton that I was going to have him in for three hours, that I was going to do two hours of overdrive today, but we're just going to be able to do two hours because I can't turn down RT that reaches at least five million people in total.
[02:00:39.591 --> 02:00:47.839]  So I'm gonna be on that at three, but I'm gonna invite Randy back in the next few weeks to do another two hours with us because this is so important.
[02:00:47.839 --> 02:00:51.962]  He'll be with us in here in the next segment and he's been out of town.
[02:00:51.962 --> 02:00:56.286]  He lives in Austin at big seminars and teaching lawyers this information.
[02:00:56.286 --> 02:00:59.089]  So he's come to town just especially to talk to us.
[02:00:59.089 --> 02:01:02.112]  We're gonna get into all things the mortgages, the economy, the military,
[02:01:02.492 --> 02:01:02.832]  We're good to go.
[02:01:25.805 --> 02:01:26.486]  We're good to go!
[02:01:49.158 --> 02:01:49.499]  I don't know.
[02:02:02.017 --> 02:02:04.238]  I just can't keep it all in my head anymore.
[02:02:04.238 --> 02:02:07.640]  Did I get the radio station right, KSCO?
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:09.480]  Good, I'm glad I got that right.
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:12.782]  All the time I've got just all this other stuff going on in my brain.
[02:02:12.782 --> 02:02:15.843]  I'm going to be talking about mortgages, the banks, martial law.
[02:02:15.843 --> 02:02:16.764]  I've got all this other stuff.
[02:02:16.764 --> 02:02:19.385]  I'm dealing with trying to get this social network launched.
[02:02:19.385 --> 02:02:20.765]  All that's going on during the breaks.
[02:02:20.765 --> 02:02:24.087]  I'm talking to people and I get in here and I've got to kind of reset to be focused.
[02:02:24.767 --> 02:02:27.289]  Point is, KSCO.com.
[02:02:27.289 --> 02:02:30.152]  KSCO.com.
[02:02:30.152 --> 02:02:35.276]  If you want to get tickets, they're about to sell out to the second showing on that Monday evening.
[02:02:35.276 --> 02:02:37.278]  I'll speak for two hours, take questions for 30 minutes.
[02:02:37.278 --> 02:02:40.741]  It's $10.80 for 10.80 a.m.
[02:02:40.741 --> 02:02:46.306]  And Michael Zwirling, known as MZ the Great Guy, he has me on two stations there, and both of them are just blowtorches.
[02:02:46.306 --> 02:02:47.267]  One of them especially covers
[02:02:48.007 --> 02:02:54.730]  You know, the Bay Area, not just Santa Cruz, and we've had a huge response off those great folks, and I always enjoy talking to him.
[02:02:54.730 --> 02:02:59.673]  So KSCO.com, if you want to get tickets, they're almost gone.
[02:02:59.673 --> 02:03:01.934]  And MZ was very excited in the emails he's gotten.
[02:03:01.934 --> 02:03:03.654]  People are coming from three, four states away.
[02:03:03.654 --> 02:03:14.980]  They're coming from Oregon, they're coming from Idaho, they're coming from Utah, they're coming from Colorado, they're coming from New Mexico, they're coming from Arizona, they're coming from all over California.
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:27.741]  And I didn't we could have gotten a place for 2000 and if I would have hammered it I'm sure we could have sold out the second showing of 2000 but you know I like speaking and people say I'm best in person but
[02:03:30.635 --> 02:03:30.875]  I don't
[02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:52.110]  We really should do more of these.
[02:03:52.110 --> 02:03:59.335]  At least once a month or so I should do a speaking engagement around the country because it gets local news attention to show people how strong the patriot movement is.
[02:03:59.335 --> 02:04:07.180]  It also, we can then shoot video of the speech, put it on YouTube and then reach millions of people digitally that way.
[02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:13.604]  So I'm really glad that MZ prodded me because listeners prodded him to come out there and speak and I look forward to seeing him in person.
[02:04:13.604 --> 02:04:17.426]  He's actually come to Austin and seen me and I've had a chance to meet him and his mother who he brought along.
[02:04:17.426 --> 02:04:17.967]  He was here at a
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:21.023]  Seminar on vitamins and stuff.
[02:04:21.023 --> 02:04:21.925]  He's big into that.
[02:04:21.925 --> 02:04:22.866]  Great guy.
[02:04:22.866 --> 02:04:25.311]  So I look forward to seeing you all out there Sunday and Monday.
[02:04:25.311 --> 02:04:28.297]  And I'm also killing two birds with one stone while I'm out in California.
[02:04:28.297 --> 02:04:29.599]  I'm out there on a secret mission.
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:33.342]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[02:04:33.342 --> 02:04:35.783]  But that's all coming up.
[02:04:35.783 --> 02:04:39.026]  Randy Kelton in studio with some of the most important information ever.
[02:04:39.026 --> 02:04:48.232]  And even if you don't have a mortgage in foreclosure or in trouble, this affects you because the mega banks are saying they can take your house even if it's paid for and they don't have the note, they don't have the deed.
[02:04:48.232 --> 02:04:53.775]  And this goes to the confidence of the entire system and just how out of control and ruthless these criminals are.
[02:04:53.775 --> 02:04:58.559]  So, two hours of this information coming up straight ahead with Randy Kelton in studio.
[02:04:58.559 --> 02:05:00.000]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:08.462]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:08.462 --> 02:05:13.603]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.603 --> 02:05:22.325]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:22.325 --> 02:05:26.406]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:26.406 --> 02:05:28.347]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.694 --> 02:05:35.417]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:35.417 --> 02:05:39.260]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:40.480]  Others don't.
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:42.622]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.622 --> 02:05:44.423]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:44.423 --> 02:05:47.305]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:47.305 --> 02:05:51.547]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[02:05:56.631 --> 02:05:58.992]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:05:58.992 --> 02:05:59.833]  Others don't.
[02:06:01.314 --> 02:06:05.395]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[02:08:12.652 --> 02:08:14.194]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.194 --> 02:08:18.398]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.398 --> 02:08:22.702]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.702 --> 02:08:28.888]  Alright, with us, into the...
[02:08:30.329 --> 02:08:33.391]  Overdrive fourth hour today is Randy Kelton.
[02:08:33.391 --> 02:08:43.436]  I remember 10 years ago researching mortgage fraud and hearing about how they were selling the mortgages over and over again at different institutions as derivatives.
[02:08:43.436 --> 02:08:49.560]  This all really kicked off 11 years ago with the end of Glass-Steagall that Bill Clinton honchoed through with the Republicans as well in 1999.
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:58.745]  So it allows them to go away from fractional reserve banking where a bank can loan out $10 for every dollar it's got in holdings to just unlimited and they've now created one point
[02:08:59.025 --> 02:08:59.405]  I think?
[02:09:20.283 --> 02:09:21.704]  And now it's confirmed.
[02:09:21.704 --> 02:09:22.704]  CNN's reported it.
[02:09:22.704 --> 02:09:23.985]  We've played the clips.
[02:09:23.985 --> 02:09:27.486]  People's homes who were paid for are being taken.
[02:09:27.486 --> 02:09:30.288]  Multiple banks are trying to foreclose on the same house.
[02:09:30.288 --> 02:09:33.989]  Or Obama claimed he had this plan to let people renegotiate.
[02:09:33.989 --> 02:09:37.491]  They go in to renegotiate, sign papers, then they take the house.
[02:09:37.491 --> 02:09:39.792]  Just every form of criminality going on.
[02:09:39.792 --> 02:09:41.273]  So, a few months ago it's like...
[02:09:41.713 --> 02:09:42.734]  Conspiracy theorist.
[02:09:42.734 --> 02:09:43.654]  I saw headlines.
[02:09:43.654 --> 02:09:52.379]  Conspiracy theorist and, you know, patriots are filing paper terrorism and lying and saying that banks are taking homes without the deeds.
[02:09:52.379 --> 02:09:53.640]  This is a lie.
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:54.901]  That's just two months ago.
[02:09:54.901 --> 02:09:56.221]  Now, everywhere.
[02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:57.922]  AP, Reuters, you know, headlines.
[02:09:57.922 --> 02:10:00.584]  Bank of America suspends all foreclosures.
[02:10:00.584 --> 02:10:03.366]  The other four big banks suspend as well.
[02:10:03.366 --> 02:10:06.247]  Government, you know, Harry Reid calls on Obama to suspend it.
[02:10:06.247 --> 02:10:07.028]  Mortgage fraud.
[02:10:07.028 --> 02:10:08.208]  BBC headline.
[02:10:08.208 --> 02:10:08.589]  Obama
[02:10:09.369 --> 02:10:19.036]  To allow banks to continue mortgage fraud, but to quantify this and to cover a wide spectrum of it is Randy Kelton, because I've been studying this for 10 years since I learned about it.
[02:10:19.036 --> 02:10:25.521]  I mean, people were talking about this 10 years ago, and I've done research and don't want to give advice about mortgages because it's very complex.
[02:10:25.521 --> 02:10:26.822]  But over time, I've learned quite a bit.
[02:10:27.162 --> 02:10:29.903]  And I like Randy because he's a pro se litigant and researcher.
[02:10:29.903 --> 02:10:31.304]  It means he's not a lawyer.
[02:10:31.304 --> 02:10:32.905]  But he does advise lawyers and many others.
[02:10:32.905 --> 02:10:36.226]  He has his own radio show on RuleOfLawRadio.com.
[02:10:36.226 --> 02:10:37.547]  And Randy's an Austinite.
[02:10:37.547 --> 02:10:39.468]  I've interviewed him many years ago before.
[02:10:39.468 --> 02:10:43.530]  And he stood up against corrupt police and that's where he started was in the trenches.
[02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:49.994]  He's just dealing with the Bill of Rights and Common Law, and this mortgage situation over the last five years gets brought to him so much.
[02:10:49.994 --> 02:10:54.377]  He's researched it, and he's researched the cases that have been won, the cases that have been lost.
[02:10:54.377 --> 02:11:00.862]  They've had a, I'd say, 90 plus percent success rate blocking foreclosures with just simple things they do.
[02:11:00.862 --> 02:11:03.364]  But he will tell you there's no silver bullet.
[02:11:03.364 --> 02:11:05.065]  The courts are incredibly corrupt.
[02:11:05.065 --> 02:11:07.507]  Anybody, and I hear this all over talk radio.
[02:11:07.507 --> 02:11:08.368]  I hear it everywhere.
[02:11:08.948 --> 02:11:14.610]  And I hear it on other shows on this network, you know, saying, and I'm not trying to attack people, maybe it's going to work.
[02:11:14.610 --> 02:11:19.251]  But the point is, when they say, 100%, we can fix it, send us $10,000.
[02:11:19.251 --> 02:11:24.413]  In my opinion, don't walk, don't run, sprint away from that, okay?
[02:11:24.413 --> 02:11:31.615]  I like Randy because he just goes off the facts, and he's so busy, he won't even usually even take more people to help because he's overwhelmed.
[02:11:31.615 --> 02:11:32.956]  That's the mark of somebody real.
[02:11:34.036 --> 02:11:34.176]  Yes.
[02:11:49.622 --> 02:11:57.745]  CNBC on Monday said, had the headline, CNBC analyst predicts that Obama will legalize mortgage fraud.
[02:11:57.745 --> 02:12:00.846]  Well, they already passed the law two weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago.
[02:12:00.846 --> 02:12:02.507]  Obama has pocket vetoed.
[02:12:02.507 --> 02:12:03.487]  He didn't get rid of it.
[02:12:03.487 --> 02:12:06.268]  He just set it aside till after the election.
[02:12:06.268 --> 02:12:13.631]  So, just like Bush got caught with warrantless wiretapping on Americans and lied about it, they then had Congress pass a law retroactively making it legal.
[02:12:13.631 --> 02:12:17.412]  But if they do this, there's no confidence in mortgages, private property.
[02:12:17.412 --> 02:12:18.313]  This is so big.
[02:12:19.033 --> 02:12:19.193]  Well, I
[02:12:39.227 --> 02:12:43.210]  The Chinese, the Europeans, individual pension funds, you're hearing they're in trouble now.
[02:12:43.210 --> 02:12:45.132]  They've all been sold this.
[02:12:45.132 --> 02:12:49.776]  So Randy, let's go over how a mortgage really works, what this does to the fundamentals of land ownership in this country.
[02:12:49.776 --> 02:12:56.201]  One of the things that made it so great, you could get clearer title here than anywhere else in the world.
[02:12:56.201 --> 02:13:00.044]  And what this means, this total shift and where you see it going.
[02:13:00.044 --> 02:13:05.068]  So let's go over mortgages and then just of the cornucopia, some of the biggest scams they're running.
[02:13:05.068 --> 02:13:06.489]  Yes.
[02:13:06.489 --> 02:13:08.571]  Quickly, I'll go through how the mortgages work.
[02:13:11.734 --> 02:13:29.204]  In the late 80s, early 90s, first Clinton and then Bush, under the guise of making housing available to the poor, removed two primary protections that lenders had that restricted the actions of the lenders to protect the borrowers.
[02:13:33.283 --> 02:13:46.190]  Instead of making houses available to the poor, what they did was went to people in good, stable loans, building equity in their houses, and convinced them to do the one thing that had always been taboo.
[02:13:46.190 --> 02:13:49.272]  To speculate with your home.
[02:13:49.272 --> 02:13:52.674]  Oh yeah, look at this, the market is going straight up.
[02:13:52.674 --> 02:13:58.978]  You sell this crummy old house you're in, buy this real expense when you can't afford, eh, don't worry about it, a couple years, price will go up.
[02:13:59.926 --> 02:14:07.430]  You'll be inverted, you can get a new loan on it, you'll have so much equity in it, you'll owe almost nothing.
[02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:08.911]  People bought this story, they thought.
[02:14:09.864 --> 02:14:11.925]  That the mortgage industry was increasing.
[02:14:11.925 --> 02:14:16.467]  That the demand for property was increasing.
[02:14:16.467 --> 02:14:18.788]  It wasn't an increase in demand.
[02:14:18.788 --> 02:14:22.229]  It talked all these people into getting out of the houses they were in and moving into another one.
[02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:24.030]  So it was a movement.
[02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:25.491]  And the movement created a bubble.
[02:14:25.491 --> 02:14:28.272]  They knew full well it was creating a bubble.
[02:14:28.272 --> 02:14:33.294]  At about the same time, somebody come up with this great idea.
[02:14:33.294 --> 02:14:34.275]  We have all of these
[02:14:36.542 --> 02:14:38.602]  Investment funds.
[02:14:38.602 --> 02:14:44.243]  Primarily your retirement and my retirement.
[02:14:44.243 --> 02:14:49.984]  All of this money building up in these long-term funds that need a place to invest.
[02:14:49.984 --> 02:14:53.785]  And they come up with a great idea how to strip all of it.
[02:14:53.785 --> 02:15:05.607]  First we strip the equity from the property owner by getting him to sell his property and commit his equity to a new purchase that the lender intends they cannot pay.
[02:15:07.130 --> 02:15:23.601]  And then, we sell this as a security into an investment pool, and get the borrowers' employers to invest their retirement fund in the investment pool, and in the endgame, we'll steal it all, and that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:15:23.601 --> 02:15:34.088]  And we saw them in those seven, the very financial publications that have promoted this fraud, we saw them start to bash the housing system, and purposefully cause the bubble to pop.
[02:15:34.508 --> 02:15:50.415]  Then we saw in October of 2008, Paulson and others, the head of the Treasury, the head of the Federal Reserve, come out in bad mouth and say we're going into a depression to further destroy confidence because there was so much irrational exuberance that they'd injected into us that people weren't popping the bubble.
[02:15:50.415 --> 02:15:52.816]  And so they came in and popped it themselves.
[02:15:52.816 --> 02:15:53.856]  Precisely.
[02:15:53.856 --> 02:15:57.178]  And there was one other thing that occurred that allowed this to happen.
[02:15:58.158 --> 02:16:00.440]  In 1907, there was a major stock market crash.
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:05.523]  This crash was caused because people were allowed to invest in a stock without owning it.
[02:16:05.523 --> 02:16:07.584]  They could go into what they called a bucket shop.
[02:16:07.584 --> 02:16:14.268]  You can look on the internet and do a search for financial weapons of mass destruction.
[02:16:14.268 --> 02:16:16.009]  It's kind of like naked shorting.
[02:16:16.009 --> 02:16:20.452]  Yeah, and 60 Minutes did a little section on this.
[02:16:20.452 --> 02:16:24.595]  After the crash of 1907, the legislature said, no more of that, it's felony to do it.
[02:16:25.879 --> 02:16:31.644]  The last thing the legislature did in the year 2000 was remove that restriction.
[02:16:31.644 --> 02:16:35.627]  Then the banksters could start selling derivatives again.
[02:16:36.772 --> 02:16:40.295]  This is absolutely unregulated speculation.
[02:16:40.295 --> 02:16:47.821]  So, a lender goes to you and induces you into a loan that you cannot pay.
[02:16:47.821 --> 02:16:50.343]  And it is his intent that you cannot pay it.
[02:16:50.343 --> 02:17:03.735]  Most people, when they hear that, they think of a mortgage company like we think of It's a Wonderful Life, where a bank gathers funds from the neighborhood, loans out those funds, collects them back over time at a profit.
[02:17:04.776 --> 02:17:09.279]  After these changes in the late nineties, that's not what happened anymore.
[02:17:09.279 --> 02:17:15.344]  Now there was an opportunity for a lender, for someone to go into business as a mortgage company.
[02:17:15.344 --> 02:17:24.970]  Go to a large lender, Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, get a large loan, convert that loan into twenty, thirty year mortgages.
[02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:29.173]  Problem they had, is they had to pay that loan back within six to nine months.
[02:17:29.173 --> 02:17:32.476]  So they never had any intention of keeping the loan.
[02:17:32.476 --> 02:17:33.777]  They go to the seller,
[02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:39.034]  Extract a loan from their credit line.
[02:17:39.034 --> 02:17:43.698]  Give the seller a promissory note with instant value, present value.
[02:17:43.698 --> 02:17:45.119]  Check.
[02:17:45.119 --> 02:17:53.707]  They, in return for the title, they take the title, they trade it to the buyer for a promissory note with no present value, but with increased future value.
[02:17:53.707 --> 02:17:55.529]  Well, they need present value.
[02:17:55.529 --> 02:17:56.890]  Pay back the bank.
[02:17:56.890 --> 02:17:59.913]  So they take that and sell it to an investment pool.
[02:18:00.993 --> 02:18:02.515]  Special purpose vehicle.
[02:18:02.515 --> 02:18:14.266]  A special purpose vehicle set, created for the purpose of gathering together a bunch of loans into a single pool and then they file it with the IRS as a real estate mortgage investment conduit.
[02:18:14.266 --> 02:18:16.368]  And they filed it as derivatives with no deed.
[02:18:16.368 --> 02:18:19.071]  Yeah, well they get it there.
[02:18:19.071 --> 02:18:22.093]  And the problem with it, that would have been bad enough
[02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:27.985]  But they didn't just sell it to a special purpose vehicle.
[02:18:27.985 --> 02:18:31.529]  They sold it to lots of special purpose vehicles.
[02:18:31.529 --> 02:18:32.850]  Selling the same note 20 to 30 times.
[02:18:34.887 --> 02:18:37.928]  It was just an unregulated glut on the market.
[02:18:37.928 --> 02:18:40.848]  And that's what the media is just now getting around to admitting.
[02:18:40.848 --> 02:18:48.790]  That's why you'll have two, three, four, five banks trying to foreclose on the same apartment house, or the same home, or the same golf course, because there's an even bigger swindle.
[02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:53.012]  They didn't just AAA rate bad mortgages to people that couldn't pay it back.
[02:18:53.012 --> 02:18:57.653]  That was just the vector point of the epicenter.
[02:18:57.653 --> 02:19:02.914]  The real fraud is they've sold these over and over again in literal counterfeiting.
[02:19:03.274 --> 02:19:04.555]  Exactly.
[02:19:04.555 --> 02:19:07.518]  Most people think that the banks defrauded them.
[02:19:07.518 --> 02:19:10.240]  What they did to you is chump change.
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:13.383]  The one they're really after is the backside investor.
[02:19:13.383 --> 02:19:20.129]  That's the one they really defrauded and they created your note as a vehicle to perpetrate the further fraud.
[02:19:21.246 --> 02:19:31.509]  And in the process of doing it, the more expensive they could create, more expensive a loan product they could create, the more profit they made immediately when they sold it to the investor.
[02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:35.751]  Because all these different investment vehicles, as they pass it on the line, they're getting fees.
[02:19:36.448 --> 02:19:38.770]  Yes, and they do more than that.
[02:19:38.770 --> 02:19:43.412]  They gather these together, and they monitor the income streams.
[02:19:43.412 --> 02:19:46.114]  What they guarantee to the investor is an income stream.
[02:19:46.114 --> 02:19:51.177]  So if one's producing well, the other one's not, they do credit default swaps.
[02:19:51.177 --> 02:19:52.398]  All right, well, stay there.
[02:19:52.398 --> 02:19:57.061]  Let's continue, and they have fake insurance put on it, and that's something else.
[02:19:57.061 --> 02:19:57.421]  They sell.
[02:19:57.421 --> 02:19:58.042]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.564 --> 02:20:06.127]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.127 --> 02:20:07.028]  Number 1.
[02:20:07.028 --> 02:20:10.450]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.450 --> 02:20:11.311]  Number 2.
[02:20:11.311 --> 02:20:16.214]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:16.214 --> 02:20:16.954]  It's true.
[02:20:16.954 --> 02:20:21.818]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.818 --> 02:20:22.638]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.638 --> 02:20:26.240]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:29.923]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.123 --> 02:20:30.924]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.924 --> 02:20:33.686]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.686 --> 02:20:37.368]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.368 --> 02:20:38.169]  Number 5.
[02:20:38.169 --> 02:20:42.312]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.312 --> 02:20:47.075]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:21:03.769 --> 02:21:05.951]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:21:05.951 --> 02:21:09.294]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:14.018]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.378 --> 02:21:18.881]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.881 --> 02:21:21.343]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.343 --> 02:21:24.125]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:24.125 --> 02:21:27.027]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:27.027 --> 02:21:34.633]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.969 --> 02:21:40.353]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.353 --> 02:21:43.214]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:43.214 --> 02:21:46.897]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.897 --> 02:21:47.977]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.977 --> 02:21:49.318]  You're everyone else.

[02:22:03.303 --> 02:22:07.445]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:22:07.445 --> 02:22:09.726]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:09.726 --> 02:22:14.888]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:22:14.888 --> 02:22:16.689]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:22:16.689 --> 02:22:18.250]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:22:18.250 --> 02:22:19.731]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:22.772]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:22:23.092 --> 02:22:28.456]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.

[02:24:08.092 --> 02:24:17.318]  Randy Kelton, 57-year-old father, grandfather, Vietnam veteran, crusader against corrupt courts, really researching the mortgage situation.
[02:24:17.318 --> 02:24:30.747]  So, Randy, they've sold all these derivatives now, China, the EU, pension funds, and they told us back in October two years ago, they said, oh, we're going to need these billions, these trillions of unfreezed mortgages.
[02:24:30.747 --> 02:24:35.871]  But the day after October 4th, Paulson said, we're going to spend it on something else, we're not going to tell you.
[02:24:36.511 --> 02:24:37.391]  One of the first things they do
[02:25:05.851 --> 02:25:27.025]  Is they convince the loan broker, the person who brings the customer to the lender, they convince him to breach his fiduciary duty to the borrower by lying to him and telling him that the property is worth a whole lot more than it is.
[02:25:28.289 --> 02:25:33.193]  And you tend to believe that because the appraiser will appraise it for a whole lot more than it's worth.
[02:25:33.193 --> 02:25:34.394]  So there's systemic fraud.
[02:25:34.394 --> 02:25:42.520]  Yeah, and the appraiser will appraise it for a whole lot more than it's worth because only the banks can hire appraisers by the bank's rules.
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:53.569]  This way they get to increase the initial amount of the value of the property, they get to increase the initial amount of the loan, and they collect fees at closing.
[02:25:54.864 --> 02:25:58.988]  If anybody has a loan here, you look at your HUD-1 Settlement Statement and list all the fees they charged you.
[02:25:58.988 --> 02:26:03.051]  A good portion of those are forbidden to be charged to you.
[02:26:03.051 --> 02:26:08.656]  They charge those to you, then take those fees, give them to the broker under the table.
[02:26:08.656 --> 02:26:16.223]  The broker who brings you the loan is only allowed to receive 1% of the principal of the note as a commission.
[02:26:16.223 --> 02:26:20.987]  That's so that everywhere the broker looks, everybody's going to pay him the same.
[02:26:20.987 --> 02:26:21.407]  However,
[02:26:22.403 --> 02:26:31.408]  The lenders are sliding the money under the table to get him to lie to the borrower and bring him a more expensive loan product.
[02:26:31.408 --> 02:26:35.050]  When they do that, then the lender can take the loan.
[02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:39.453]  As soon as you sign it, he's going to take it and sell it.
[02:26:39.453 --> 02:26:46.136]  He will receive consideration from the investor, but he keeps the lien.
[02:26:46.136 --> 02:26:46.997]  He'll sell the note.
[02:26:46.997 --> 02:26:48.378]  The note is like a check.
[02:26:49.281 --> 02:26:51.823]  You write a check, that's a security instrument.
[02:26:51.823 --> 02:27:00.368]  You write a note, that's a security instrument that doesn't get collected all in one moment, it gets collected monthly over a period of years.
[02:27:00.368 --> 02:27:02.169]  Essentially it's the same thing.
[02:27:02.169 --> 02:27:08.072]  So he takes that check and he sells it to the investor, but he doesn't give them the lien document.
[02:27:08.072 --> 02:27:11.995]  The document that is there to protect him in case you don't pay.
[02:27:13.126 --> 02:27:41.091]  And it took a long time to figure that out because the Supreme Court of Kansas addressed this issue and they said, while you can separate these two, it's legal, but if you do that, then you've created a fatal flaw in that the guy who purchased the security instrument, he has a claim against the property, but no, I'm sorry, he has a claim against the signator on the note, the guy who signed it, but no claim against the property.
[02:27:42.366 --> 02:27:49.169]  The lender holding the lien, he has a claim against the property, but he received consideration he can't be armed.
[02:27:49.169 --> 02:27:50.090]  So the lien's void.
[02:27:50.090 --> 02:27:53.031]  So that's how you have multiple banks coming after the same property?
[02:27:53.031 --> 02:28:05.737]  No, what the lender then did, the special purpose vehicle that purchased the note, he combined it into a whole bunch of different pools instead of one
[02:28:07.253 --> 02:28:13.595]  Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit, he combined it in a whole bunch of them and sold them over and over again.
[02:28:13.595 --> 02:28:18.177]  So, he got multiple consideration for the note.
[02:28:18.177 --> 02:28:28.060]  What we're saying is, even if you didn't pay the note, and even if the payment is owed, the question becomes, who's it owed to?
[02:28:29.482 --> 02:28:30.583]  Who actually owns it?
[02:28:30.583 --> 02:28:37.787]  So that's how they're taking houses that are completely paid for because it doesn't matter because somebody else can claim they have some type of ownership to it.
[02:28:37.787 --> 02:28:38.247]  Exactly.
[02:28:38.247 --> 02:28:42.990]  We have a guy in California that Bank of America came and took his house.
[02:28:42.990 --> 02:28:46.352]  Two months later, Chase came and tried to take his house.
[02:28:46.352 --> 02:28:47.392]  They all think they own it.
[02:28:47.392 --> 02:28:49.514]  They've sold it to everybody.
[02:28:49.514 --> 02:28:57.018]  But the question I had was why would the lender keep the security, keep the lien, if it causes much of a problem?
[02:28:58.308 --> 02:29:07.933]  He kept it because he'll hold it for three years, file a trustee IRS Form 1099-A, write it all off his capital gains tax as abandoned funds.
[02:29:07.933 --> 02:29:10.254]  He gets consideration a second time.
[02:29:10.254 --> 02:29:15.416]  And then once he sells the note to the investor, he becomes the servicer of the note.
[02:29:15.416 --> 02:29:19.138]  If you pay the note on time, he gets three percent of the payment.
[02:29:19.138 --> 02:29:21.539]  Pay it late, he gets an extra five.
[02:29:21.539 --> 02:29:27.442]  It is in his best interest to create a loan the borrower has to struggle to pay and regularly
[02:29:28.735 --> 02:29:31.117]  We're on the march.
[02:29:31.117 --> 02:29:32.337]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.767 --> 02:29:58.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:05.903]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.903 --> 02:30:06.823]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.823 --> 02:30:10.246]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.246 --> 02:30:11.106]  Number 2.
[02:30:11.106 --> 02:30:16.009]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:16.009 --> 02:30:16.750]  It's true.
[02:30:16.750 --> 02:30:21.613]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.613 --> 02:30:22.453]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.453 --> 02:30:26.036]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:26.036 --> 02:30:29.738]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.938 --> 02:30:30.718]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.718 --> 02:30:33.479]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.479 --> 02:30:37.161]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.161 --> 02:30:37.961]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.961 --> 02:30:42.103]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.103 --> 02:30:47.165]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.165 --> 02:30:51.326]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.326 --> 02:30:53.107]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:01.531 --> 02:31:05.112]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:05.112 --> 02:31:06.413]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:06.413 --> 02:31:10.815]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:10.815 --> 02:31:16.758]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:16.758 --> 02:31:18.899]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:18.899 --> 02:31:21.580]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:28.426]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:31:28.426 --> 02:31:30.648]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:31:30.648 --> 02:31:35.992]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:31:35.992 --> 02:31:41.277]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:31:41.277 --> 02:31:46.441]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.

[02:31:52.824 --> 02:31:53.584]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:32:04.995 --> 02:32:06.255]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:06.255 --> 02:32:09.816]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.816 --> 02:32:12.437]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.437 --> 02:32:18.298]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:18.298 --> 02:32:24.959]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.959 --> 02:32:30.940]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:34.641]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:32:35.121 --> 02:32:39.403]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:39.403 --> 02:32:45.346]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:45.346 --> 02:32:48.908]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.908 --> 02:32:50.889]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.889 --> 02:32:52.009]  It's here.

[02:33:07.655 --> 02:33:12.060]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:17.788]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:22.074 --> 02:33:24.795]  It's 1.33 Central Standard Time.
[02:33:24.795 --> 02:33:31.059]  We're going to be going into overdrive the full fourth hour at InfoWars.com and carried by all of our wonderful affiliates.
[02:33:31.059 --> 02:33:34.741]  Randy Kelton, pro se litigant researcher, is here with us.
[02:33:34.741 --> 02:33:38.763]  So we're going through what these derivatives are, how this is working.
[02:33:38.763 --> 02:33:42.965]  We were talking during the break, clearly engineered by design.
[02:33:42.965 --> 02:33:50.269]  Then we're not going to just look at the fraud, you know, at the home buyer level and what this is going to do to society, but also the international fraud, the real fraud.
[02:33:50.689 --> 02:33:50.829]  Yes.
[02:33:50.829 --> 02:33:55.653]  I hear that might happen, but somehow I think it won't.
[02:33:55.653 --> 02:33:57.375]  I think it's worse than we... than I would imagine.
[02:33:57.375 --> 02:33:57.635]  I'm not...
[02:34:19.958 --> 02:34:22.562]  I tend not to like conspiracy theories.
[02:34:22.562 --> 02:34:24.744]  I don't want it to be that way.
[02:34:24.744 --> 02:34:27.448]  But this one was forced down my throat.
[02:34:27.448 --> 02:34:31.794]  All of these things are too well engineered to have happened by mistake.
[02:34:31.794 --> 02:34:33.396]  They just all fit together.
[02:34:33.396 --> 02:34:35.539]  The biggest problem I'll get to in a moment.
[02:34:36.738 --> 02:34:40.461]  The lender, he's the sharp point of the spear.
[02:34:40.461 --> 02:34:52.590]  He's the one that convinced the individual to go into a loan product he could not afford, and he did it because he profited at every turn.
[02:34:52.590 --> 02:35:04.600]  He profited when he sold the note, he profited when he filed the 1099-A, he profited when you paid late, he profited when you default, and all of that was chump change.
[02:35:05.828 --> 02:35:12.070]  The real profit he got, the credit default swaps, are essentially a form of insurance.
[02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:17.811]  If you look at your HUD-1 Settlement Statement, you'll see mortgage MPI, mortgage insurance protection.
[02:35:17.811 --> 02:35:24.633]  If you default on the note, the insurance company will pay him 80% of the principal, based on that insurance premium.
[02:35:24.633 --> 02:35:31.375]  What you don't know is on the derivatives market, you'll get another 8 to 10 of those.
[02:35:32.808 --> 02:35:38.090]  Anybody who thinks your lender is going to give you a modification, you are dreaming!
[02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:40.871]  That's coming out in the news now, that they do these bait-and-switches.
[02:35:40.871 --> 02:35:46.552]  Oh, there's a federal program, and people are going in to modify, and then they're baiting and switching, and then grabbing the house right there.
[02:35:46.552 --> 02:35:49.853]  Yes, I have a quick story.
[02:35:49.853 --> 02:35:54.775]  It happened to a friend of mine, and I've read exactly the same story three times.
[02:35:54.775 --> 02:35:55.715]  We're going to modify.
[02:35:55.715 --> 02:35:57.016]  I said, they're not going to modify, Ken.
[02:35:57.016 --> 02:35:57.936]  Oh, yeah, they're going to modify.
[02:35:57.936 --> 02:35:58.836]  Sue them, Ken.
[02:35:58.836 --> 02:35:59.416]  No, they're going to modify.
[02:35:59.416 --> 02:36:00.017]  They're going to help me.
[02:36:00.017 --> 02:36:00.657]  No, they're going to screw you.
[02:36:01.638 --> 02:36:02.821]  So he's going to modify it.
[02:36:02.821 --> 02:36:07.214]  They tell him there's two documents that we need, but we don't know what they are.
[02:36:07.214 --> 02:36:09.099]  He spent six weeks trying to find out what they were.
[02:36:10.279 --> 02:36:18.861]  On a Tuesday morning at nine o'clock, they called him and told him, you didn't get us those two documents, so we denied your modification.
[02:36:18.861 --> 02:36:21.002]  They sold his house within minutes.
[02:36:21.002 --> 02:36:23.383]  I've read this in three separate lawsuits.
[02:36:23.383 --> 02:36:25.143]  They set you up.
[02:36:25.143 --> 02:36:30.805]  Once you go in and try to go into modification, they tell you you don't qualify unless you're at least two payments behind.
[02:36:31.545 --> 02:36:35.147]  You're in modification and you get this notice of acceleration of the note.
[02:36:35.147 --> 02:36:36.508]  You say, wait, wait, wait, what is this?
[02:36:36.508 --> 02:36:37.669]  Oh, don't worry about that.
[02:36:37.669 --> 02:36:41.491]  They induce you to give them the two payments behind to trigger the foreclosure.
[02:36:41.491 --> 02:36:42.151]  Exactly.
[02:36:42.151 --> 02:36:46.094]  And then they run the foreclosure while they're doing the pre-ten modification.
[02:36:46.094 --> 02:36:48.955]  Well, that's like CPS in every state in the union.
[02:36:48.955 --> 02:36:50.016]  They also do this overseas.
[02:36:50.016 --> 02:36:52.938]  It's the same, you know, unified continuity of agenda.
[02:36:53.638 --> 02:36:57.462]  They say, just sign these forms and agree to go to counseling and you'll get your baby back.
[02:36:57.462 --> 02:37:07.231]  And while they've got their own hired psychiatrist lying about you who worked for them, they are already going to the court behind your back to terminate permanently parental rights.
[02:37:07.231 --> 02:37:17.121]  So they put you into a process to get you to sign more forms, and the whole thing is to create false hope, and it's sold to the public as a way to help your mortgage, and the whole thing is to induce more fraud.
[02:37:17.489 --> 02:37:23.074]  Yeah, and even if you do get a modification, the modifications they give are designed to fail.
[02:37:23.074 --> 02:37:27.998]  The modification is supposed to give you a lower payment for a period of time, and then go back to the original.
[02:37:27.998 --> 02:37:30.040]  And the modifications have accelerated foreclosure!
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:38.567]  Yeah, and if you... What actually happens is it's a lower payment for a period of time, and then it shoots way up to where it's impossible to pay.
[02:37:38.567 --> 02:37:41.489]  After modification, miss one payment, you're history.
[02:37:41.489 --> 02:37:44.592]  They can foreclose immediately, and they set you up for that.
[02:37:46.457 --> 02:37:47.558]  Think about it.
[02:37:47.558 --> 02:37:52.965]  They're going to make 8 to 10 times the amount of the principal on your note if they foreclose.
[02:37:52.965 --> 02:37:55.228]  That's all they care about.
[02:37:55.228 --> 02:37:57.471]  And they will force you into foreclosure.
[02:37:57.471 --> 02:37:59.433]  What we did is worked on remedy.
[02:38:00.376 --> 02:38:01.777]  This is all we do is remedies.
[02:38:01.777 --> 02:38:06.959]  It's not polite to tell somebody you have a big problem unless you show them how to fix it.
[02:38:06.959 --> 02:38:15.383]  And we worked on a remedy because it became so clear if we don't do something... Yeah, let's talk about the remedies you've done that are working well.
[02:38:15.383 --> 02:38:20.766]  Let's talk about the other cases that are being won against these crooks that are bringing them to their knees.
[02:38:20.766 --> 02:38:23.127]  You know, why they're freezing the foreclosures.
[02:38:23.487 --> 02:38:26.409]  Just got a call from one of our people today.
[02:38:26.409 --> 02:38:28.871]  The attorney called him.
[02:38:28.871 --> 02:38:31.013]  Let's make a deal.
[02:38:31.013 --> 02:38:32.434]  The heat is on the lender.
[02:38:32.434 --> 02:38:34.075]  We've been saying for a long time.
[02:38:34.075 --> 02:38:45.243]  When the Feds gave, when the legislature allotted $200 million to the Feds to investigate a financial crime, I told my co-host then, watch.
[02:38:45.243 --> 02:38:46.884]  June and July they'll start indicting.
[02:38:47.771 --> 02:38:54.634]  September, October, they'll start prosecuting so they can say to the voter, oh, look at us.
[02:38:54.634 --> 02:38:58.576]  Oh yeah, we voted for that bailout, but we got tricked into it.
[02:38:58.576 --> 02:39:00.417]  But they're burning some low-level people.
[02:39:00.417 --> 02:39:01.817]  And we're helping you.
[02:39:01.817 --> 02:39:03.838]  They needed a scapegoat.
[02:39:03.838 --> 02:39:06.699]  And they have thrown the lender to the wolves.
[02:39:06.699 --> 02:39:11.682]  Frankly, they've done it much worse than I expected, and that scares me.
[02:39:11.682 --> 02:39:14.403]  Because there's something more sinister underneath all of this.
[02:39:15.595 --> 02:39:21.376]  Because of the way the note has been sold around to different places?
[02:39:21.376 --> 02:39:23.577]  Who owns the note?
[02:39:23.577 --> 02:39:27.297]  That is an incredibly major problem.
[02:39:27.297 --> 02:39:38.460]  This country became a mecca for foreign investment because in this country, if you purchase a piece of property, you can trace the ownership of that property back to the original land grant.
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:44.381]  That gave foreign countries confidence that they could invest and not have their investment taken away from them.
[02:39:45.689 --> 02:39:50.294]  Now, with what's happening, no one knows who owns what.
[02:39:51.266 --> 02:40:02.674]  This will create a problem that will haunt this country for generations and plunge us into the worst depression that we've ever seen, and I suspect worse than we even imagined.
[02:40:02.674 --> 02:40:18.985]  What they're doing is they are clouding property rights and property deeds in this country to have government, as they're now announcing, come in and change fundamental property law in this nation in the name of fixing it.
[02:40:18.985 --> 02:40:20.886]  Yes, they're going to bring us to third world status.
[02:40:22.045 --> 02:40:25.486]  They will plunge us into a depression that we have no way to get out of.
[02:40:25.486 --> 02:40:34.107]  And China today said they're mad about this, and the New York Times is reporting they're freezing all rare earth mineral shipments to the United States.
[02:40:34.107 --> 02:40:35.108]  I'm not surprised.
[02:40:35.108 --> 02:40:37.528]  China really got hoodwinked on this one.
[02:40:37.528 --> 02:40:45.950]  And a lot of the pressure that's on Bank of America is because China's suing them and the egg for selling them the same notes 20 and 30 times over.
[02:40:47.799 --> 02:41:10.846]  Okay, so let's get into, before we cover all that, because there's so much to get into here, because there's what's happening locally and then there's the big international scheme, but go over the successes you and many others and lawyers are having in court by going in and showing the corruption, the fraud of the lenders, of the brokers and others, and the fact that when you just sue them or kick it into criminal, that immediately checkmates them.
[02:41:10.846 --> 02:41:13.827]  Yes, and that's why I say there's no magic here.
[02:41:13.827 --> 02:41:15.028]  There's no magic bullet.
[02:41:15.828 --> 02:41:18.809]  The courts are absolutely corrupt.
[02:41:18.809 --> 02:41:24.231]  If you go into court, you can expect the court to rule against you out of hand at every turn.
[02:41:24.231 --> 02:41:25.392]  Just expect that.
[02:41:25.392 --> 02:41:29.073]  If you hire an attorney, he'll take your money and he'll screw you royal.
[02:41:29.073 --> 02:41:34.775]  You can't screw any more with the attorney because he's your attorney and he speaks for you so you have no objection.
[02:41:34.775 --> 02:41:39.497]  If you go in pro se, the courts are going to rule against you because you're pro se.
[02:41:39.497 --> 02:41:41.638]  However, as pro ses,
[02:41:42.523 --> 02:41:47.126]  We have powers and abilities beyond those of mortal attorneys.
[02:41:47.126 --> 02:41:50.849]  As pro ses, there are tools we have we can use.
[02:41:50.849 --> 02:41:54.591]  And we've put together a program to take advantage of that.
[02:41:54.591 --> 02:42:00.195]  I suggest people go into the federal court, sue in the federal court pro se.
[02:42:00.195 --> 02:42:06.459]  Now, we know the court's going to rule against us, whether we have an attorney or not an attorney, so having one or not is not going to help us.
[02:42:06.459 --> 02:42:10.122]  But as pro ses, there are things we can do.
[02:42:10.122 --> 02:42:11.163]  The courts hate pro ses.
[02:42:12.298 --> 02:42:15.860]  They don't hate pro se's because pro se's write stupid pleadings.
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:22.083]  They hate pro se's because every once in a while they come across the pro se from hell.
[02:42:22.083 --> 02:42:26.325]  The pro se who knows the power he has.
[02:42:26.325 --> 02:42:33.309]  The pro se can go after the judge and go after the other attorneys with relative impunity.
[02:42:33.309 --> 02:42:37.731]  And there's only one way the judge has of influencing anyone in the case.
[02:42:38.649 --> 02:42:44.473]  He has to influence the attorney on the other side to your benefit to get you off of his case.
[02:42:44.473 --> 02:42:53.079]  But in order to get there, we have to give tools to the judge that he can use.
[02:42:53.079 --> 02:42:59.603]  Frankly, we seem to be getting far better opinions from the judges than I had expected.
[02:43:00.968 --> 02:43:03.749]  Okay, but let's just quantify this before we get into some of the things you're doing.
[02:43:03.749 --> 02:43:11.111]  Some of the cases that are being won, the successes you're having in blocking them, but, I mean, there's been a lot of these big cases where the banks are losing.
[02:43:11.111 --> 02:43:12.272]  Yeah, and that's what I'm saying.
[02:43:12.272 --> 02:43:16.893]  The judges, they're being, I've always said, it's not about law, it's about politics.
[02:43:16.893 --> 02:43:22.435]  Sure, exactly, but I mean, what specifically is successful in court so far against them?
[02:43:22.435 --> 02:43:25.056]  Who holds the note?
[02:43:25.056 --> 02:43:28.977]  First, whoever's doing the foreclosure, who are you?
[02:43:30.731 --> 02:43:34.053]  How do you have agency to represent the principal?
[02:43:34.053 --> 02:43:41.416]  And if you do have agency, even if you can prove it, most of these attorneys who are doing foreclosures don't have a contract with the principal.
[02:43:41.416 --> 02:43:47.279]  They just find out which loans are in foreclosure and they just pick them up and run with them.
[02:43:47.279 --> 02:43:48.860]  So they don't have real standing?
[02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:50.841]  Have no standing at all.
[02:43:50.841 --> 02:43:55.283]  And the trick of agency, agency cannot be proven out of the mouth of the agent.
[02:43:55.283 --> 02:43:59.085]  It must be proven out of the mouth of the principal, so who the heck is the principal?
[02:44:00.063 --> 02:44:03.947]  For the most part, the one doing the foreclosure has no clue.
[02:44:03.947 --> 02:44:07.171]  And that's why the banks admit they've frozen the foreclosures.
[02:44:07.171 --> 02:44:14.700]  Most of the big ones have, Bank of America and the other four big ones, is because they're trying to find out who is the principal who has standing in court.
[02:44:14.700 --> 02:44:18.204]  Yes, and their problem is there's no way to do that.
[02:44:19.650 --> 02:44:20.850]  It's lost.
[02:44:20.850 --> 02:44:23.451]  Forty percent of all of the notes have been destroyed.
[02:44:23.451 --> 02:44:30.574]  So the solution is, Congress passes a law, Obama hasn't signed it yet, saying megabanks can take anything they want.
[02:44:30.574 --> 02:44:32.174]  They are now godlike.
[02:44:32.174 --> 02:44:41.538]  But then politically, to try that, that's going to cause a revolution, even with brain-dead fluoride heads, hence Time Magazine headline, Prospect for Civil War in U.S.
[02:44:41.538 --> 02:44:43.238]  doesn't seem that far-fetched.
[02:44:43.238 --> 02:44:44.719]  Exactly.
[02:44:44.719 --> 02:44:47.160]  In looking at this, there may be another agenda.
[02:44:48.334 --> 02:44:54.058]  It may be that we're simply pawns and to them we're not that important.
[02:44:54.058 --> 02:45:02.623]  I don't see that they have, that the real money people, the Bilderbergs and the other ones behind all of these, they don't care if they sacrifice the lender.
[02:45:02.623 --> 02:45:17.032]  And right now, the one thing they could do to stabilize this country and still keep their money is forbid the payment of the credit default swaps, derivatives.
[02:45:18.544 --> 02:45:28.252]  If the insurer can no longer pay the derivative, then the bank doesn't have that motivation to foreclose.
[02:45:28.252 --> 02:45:31.875]  Now it has to foreclose based on the property itself.
[02:45:31.875 --> 02:45:38.540]  That's why the banks haven't cared about depressing the economy by all of this and destroying their original investment, because they're getting paid to the derivative.
[02:45:38.786 --> 02:45:41.390]  They're getting paid through the nose.
[02:45:41.390 --> 02:45:42.431]  Big time.
[02:45:42.431 --> 02:45:46.477]  We stop that, we stop a lot of their incentive.
[02:45:46.477 --> 02:45:49.621]  But what we're looking at is first thing we create remedy.
[02:45:49.621 --> 02:45:51.123]  And we're stopping them.
[02:45:51.123 --> 02:45:52.225]  We've stopped over 200 so far.
[02:45:54.172 --> 02:46:01.137]  It takes a couple of years to get through a suit, and we've only been doing it since last November, so we haven't had any go all the way through yet.
[02:46:01.137 --> 02:46:15.328]  But almost everyone is still in their house, and the only ones that aren't are the ones that were so close to... And we're going to talk about what you've done with over 200 cases, specifically, with much better results than almost everybody else out there, but let's go to the people that did start this two years ago.
[02:46:15.328 --> 02:46:20.272]  We're now seeing success, success, success by pro ses, by lawyers, by law firms.
[02:46:20.752 --> 02:46:22.693]  And you talk about being a plagiarist.
[02:46:22.693 --> 02:46:25.013]  Well, it's not plagiarism in law.
[02:46:25.013 --> 02:46:27.574]  It's called precedent.
[02:46:27.574 --> 02:46:29.494]  So they're going in and saying, show us the note.
[02:46:29.494 --> 02:46:30.475]  What else are they doing?
[02:46:30.475 --> 02:46:39.097]  Yes, and I say I'm a plagiarist, and that's because I'm not going out and trying to find something new, some magic trick that we can pull.
[02:46:39.097 --> 02:46:42.158]  I'm just looking at what people have been winning.
[02:46:42.158 --> 02:46:48.720]  We had two recent decisions in San Diego, California, where the guy filed bankruptcy
[02:46:49.784 --> 02:46:53.608]  And claimed that the lender had an unsecured note.
[02:46:53.608 --> 02:46:55.490]  And he said, oh no, no, I've got a secured note.
[02:46:55.490 --> 02:46:58.432]  He said, well, show it to me.
[02:46:58.432 --> 02:47:02.016]  Prove that you have, that you're the holder of this note.
[02:47:02.016 --> 02:47:04.639]  And they made no attempt to.
[02:47:04.639 --> 02:47:05.459]  Because couldn't.
[02:47:05.459 --> 02:47:06.861]  They knew they couldn't.
[02:47:06.861 --> 02:47:13.167]  The real question, the only question, who is the true holder of the note?
[02:47:15.017 --> 02:47:22.020]  The holder of the note can only be the holder of the note if somebody who held it legally put it in his hand.
[02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:27.302]  And that person must have got it from somebody who held it legally, all the way back to the original lender.
[02:47:27.302 --> 02:47:37.186]  And because of the glut on Wall Street, the glut of profit-taking, that it was too much trouble to keep track of all of these notes, when you put 10,000 notes in one pool,
[02:47:39.281 --> 02:47:42.744]  And then you sell that pool to different investors.
[02:47:42.744 --> 02:47:47.149]  And then you transfer, swap part of the pool to another pool, another one back.
[02:47:47.149 --> 02:47:56.297]  The law says that the sale of a security instrument based on real property must be filed with the county recorder's office.
[02:47:56.297 --> 02:47:58.740]  It must be a public sale.
[02:47:58.740 --> 02:48:02.763]  So even if he comes to the court and says, well, I've got this note.
[02:48:04.136 --> 02:48:05.477]  I'm the holder of it.
[02:48:05.477 --> 02:48:10.280]  We go look in the county recorder's office and say, well, I don't see your name in there.
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:26.230]  So either you hold this note illegally, that you don't hold it at all, or if you do hold it, then you hold it in consequence of an ongoing criminal conspiracy to trade in illegal securities.
[02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:32.234]  You come to the court with dirty hands, and the court has no authority to let you profit from this illegal scheme.
[02:48:32.234 --> 02:48:33.035]  So either way they go.
[02:48:33.988 --> 02:48:34.749]  They got a problem.
[02:48:34.749 --> 02:48:53.150]  Well, studying property law a little bit myself, correct me if I'm wrong, but let's say properties change hands three or four times to a piece of ranch property, but you go back to the original contract, if there was any fraud in that contract or fraud in the way the payments were done, everything is null and void and it reverts back to whatever happened before that contract.
[02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:56.171]  That's exactly where we're trying to take it.
[02:48:56.171 --> 02:48:58.132]  Precisely.
[02:48:58.132 --> 02:49:01.173]  What we do is demonstrate the fraud.
[02:49:01.173 --> 02:49:14.899]  And in one of my seminars, an attorney came to me and she said, when I listened to you, it sounded like you were sitting in the courtroom listening to the judge chew me out because I could only claim that they didn't have standing.
[02:49:14.899 --> 02:49:18.621]  You didn't bring me anything specific to this note.
[02:49:18.621 --> 02:49:21.102]  What we do is look at the numbers.
[02:49:22.190 --> 02:49:27.774]  Look at the numbers they charged, the amounts they charged you at closing.
[02:49:27.774 --> 02:49:36.101]  When you sat down to closing, do you remember the lender bringing in documentation to prove that all the fees he charged you were authorized by law?
[02:49:37.108 --> 02:49:39.609]  Were necessary?
[02:49:39.609 --> 02:49:41.630]  The amounts charged were reasonable?
[02:49:41.630 --> 02:49:44.091]  And that he didn't take an undisclosed markup on those fees?
[02:49:44.091 --> 02:49:47.072]  Because if they did that, it breaks the law, and now the whole thing's going void.
[02:49:47.072 --> 02:49:48.572]  Yeah, there's a whole bunch of them.
[02:49:48.572 --> 02:49:58.476]  What we do in developing the fraud, the first thing we want to do is look at the note and your HUD-1 settle... I'm sorry, your truth in lending statement.
[02:49:58.476 --> 02:50:02.577]  Truth in lending statement has the amount you actually pay on it.
[02:50:02.577 --> 02:50:04.438]  The note has what you agreed to pay.
[02:50:05.620 --> 02:50:07.963]  So, one of the first ones I looked at, $115,900 note, 6%.
[02:50:07.963 --> 02:50:14.110]  Truth in Lending Statement called $113,900 at $6.5.
[02:50:14.110 --> 02:50:18.235]  Well, I asked Steve about that.
[02:50:18.235 --> 02:50:23.742]  He said, well, I saw that, but I read all these documents, my brain was dead, it looked like it would balance out.
[02:50:25.350 --> 02:50:36.874]  In fact, if they paid, if Steve had paid what the Truth in Lending Statement called for over the life of the note, he would have overpaid the note $44,000.
[02:50:36.874 --> 02:50:37.994]  We ran a calculation.
[02:50:37.994 --> 02:50:41.835]  When I first ran it, I looked at it and thought, that can't be right.
[02:50:41.835 --> 02:50:44.336]  I re-ran it.
[02:50:44.336 --> 02:50:46.617]  $47 overpayment every month.
[02:50:46.617 --> 02:50:48.017]  He would have overpaid $44,000 on a $115,000 note.
[02:50:51.641 --> 02:50:58.534]  So it's just not just the fraud of the interest, it's the fraud compounded through all the extra fees they add on that is patently illegal.
[02:50:58.534 --> 02:50:59.436]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[02:51:01.986 --> 02:51:06.070]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:10.574]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.574 --> 02:51:16.739]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.739 --> 02:51:19.162]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[02:52:05.757 --> 02:52:07.017]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:07.017 --> 02:52:10.939]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.939 --> 02:52:13.179]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:13.179 --> 02:52:19.041]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:19.041 --> 02:52:25.283]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.703 --> 02:52:31.686]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.686 --> 02:52:35.867]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:35.867 --> 02:52:40.149]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:40.149 --> 02:52:46.111]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:46.111 --> 02:52:49.653]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.653 --> 02:52:51.634]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.634 --> 02:52:52.074]  It's here.

[02:53:02.261 --> 02:53:04.022]  What is a wind generator?
[02:53:04.022 --> 02:53:06.404]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:53:06.404 --> 02:53:09.786]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:53:09.786 --> 02:53:11.728]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?
[02:53:12.435 --> 02:53:16.338]  For answers to questions about wind power, visit windbluepower.com.
[02:53:16.338 --> 02:53:19.360]  Did you know the wind can provide your family with emergency power?

[02:53:41.716 --> 02:53:44.318]  The globalists know this is all very complex, but it goes back to basic
[02:54:11.141 --> 02:54:14.187]  Common law, property law in this country and worldwide.
[02:54:14.187 --> 02:54:17.554]  We haven't even gotten into the people that were sold the derivatives.
[02:54:17.554 --> 02:54:19.598]  That's the real, you know, $1,500 trillion.
[02:54:21.607 --> 02:54:26.650]  And so people having their houses stolen, that's just the bottom feeders that are involved in that.
[02:54:26.650 --> 02:54:28.332]  This scam transcends that.
[02:54:28.332 --> 02:54:30.113]  That's like with fractional reserve banking.
[02:54:30.113 --> 02:54:34.396]  You deposit your $100, they can now loan out $1,000 fiat.
[02:54:34.396 --> 02:54:39.699]  Well, this is, you know, they sell a $100,000 house and they leverage it out to hundreds of millions.
[02:54:39.699 --> 02:54:41.801]  Randy, this is a short segment, but continuing.
[02:54:42.661 --> 02:54:45.443]  They're in deep trouble to start freezing the mortgages en masse.
[02:54:45.443 --> 02:54:50.807]  They know that, and they're trying to figure out some type of political remedy for this.
[02:54:50.807 --> 02:54:56.431]  But continuing with some of the other victories that are being had against these criminals, continue.
[02:54:56.431 --> 02:55:00.834]  Okay, what we do is we create a tool you can go into court with.
[02:55:01.744 --> 02:55:07.928]  A tool that's very specific to your loan that sorts out the fraud in your note.
[02:55:07.928 --> 02:55:09.509]  And we're getting a lot of experience.
[02:55:09.509 --> 02:55:11.310]  We've got a couple hundred out there.
[02:55:11.310 --> 02:55:14.732]  We're getting a lot of responses from the court.
[02:55:14.732 --> 02:55:18.995]  And frankly, the responses from the court are surprising me.
[02:55:18.995 --> 02:55:21.977]  Initially, the courts would just blow us off.
[02:55:21.977 --> 02:55:23.578]  Our pros say they pay no attention.
[02:55:23.578 --> 02:55:25.279]  They just deny it out of hand.
[02:55:25.279 --> 02:55:26.520]  They're not doing that anymore.
[02:55:27.759 --> 02:55:34.973]  Whenever we get a denial, we tend to get a four or five page brief telling us precisely
[02:55:35.836 --> 02:55:41.800]  Why they denied it, what exactly you have to give us so we can give you the ruling we want.
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:57.529]  The indication is that the politicians are turning against the lenders in order to try to buy favor with you and I. They're going into this election with an 11% approval rating.
[02:55:57.529 --> 02:56:01.632]  Every member of the House is up for re-election and they can hear the toilet flushing.
[02:56:02.773 --> 02:56:07.957]  So the courts are asking us to give them things they can use, and that's exactly what we're doing.
[02:56:07.957 --> 02:56:19.466]  Generally, if you have a $300,000 note, I can generally find between 1 and 1.2 million in fraud claim against the lender.
[02:56:19.466 --> 02:56:26.112]  In the process of trying the case, the other side will whittle that number down, but we don't care.
[02:56:26.112 --> 02:56:27.313]  Because we know and they know.
[02:56:28.433 --> 02:56:35.376]  On the front end, if they ask where we got that number, we can take them to that number to the penny.
[02:56:35.376 --> 02:56:38.637]  Show them exactly how we got that by law.
[02:56:38.637 --> 02:56:43.099]  And in the end, there's only one number the lender's going to remember.
[02:56:43.099 --> 02:56:46.600]  I'm sorry, there's only one number the jury's going to remember.
[02:56:47.537 --> 02:56:49.578]  And that's the number we walked in the door with.
[02:56:49.578 --> 02:56:52.939]  So to be clear, the best defense is a good offense.
[02:56:52.939 --> 02:57:06.383]  I mean, you stall their foreclosures, you show all the procedural error and fraud, but you also countersue on their issues of fraud to basically create a new case, and now you can depose them.
[02:57:06.383 --> 02:57:08.683]  Now you can force them to bring in lawyers.
[02:57:08.683 --> 02:57:13.665]  Now they're not just engaged in a predator action against you, now you're fighting back.
[02:57:13.665 --> 02:57:14.225]  Exactly.
[02:57:14.985 --> 02:57:29.431]  And we're going to go after the attorney firm, and we're going to want him to tell us who the principal is, because we want that principal deposed, and then we're going to be taking criminal charges against him to the grand jury.
[02:57:29.431 --> 02:57:30.972]  We'll get their attention.
[02:57:30.972 --> 02:57:34.793]  But first we'll take it to the district attorney, and he'll refuse to act.
[02:57:34.793 --> 02:57:36.534]  At least we hope he does.
[02:57:36.534 --> 02:57:40.436]  And then we'll take it to the highest judge we can find, and he'll refuse to act.
[02:57:41.294 --> 02:57:42.975]  At least we hope he does.
[02:57:42.975 --> 02:57:54.320]  And then we'll go to the grand jury with criminal charges against the judge, accusing the judge of shielding the prosecutor from prosecution because the judge shielded his buddy Linder from prosecution.
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:56.001]  And by the way, this is all blustering fraud.
[02:57:56.001 --> 02:58:00.023]  It's like when you try to go file a complaint on a police officer, they'll tell you, get out of here, we won't let you.
[02:58:00.023 --> 02:58:03.204]  By law, they have to take it.
[02:58:03.204 --> 02:58:03.725]  Exactly.
[02:58:03.725 --> 02:58:06.466]  What we do is we turn their procedures on their head.
[02:58:07.475 --> 02:58:14.040]  There are procedures in place to get you to help the police detect crime.
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:16.842]  They want you to come in and report crime.
[02:58:16.842 --> 02:58:19.865]  If you report crime, they'll protect you.
[02:58:19.865 --> 02:58:28.732]  Problem is, we start reporting crime against them, then you get these policemen doing this little chicken dance because they don't know what to do.
[02:58:28.732 --> 02:58:34.537]  And everybody that says anything to us that is the least bit threatening, we file against them immediately.
[02:58:35.270 --> 02:58:39.596]  Back in 70 seconds with Randy Kelton, the fourth hour in overdrive.
[02:58:39.596 --> 02:58:43.141]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:58:52.639 --> 02:59:08.127]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:59:08.127 --> 02:59:11.789]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:12.816 --> 02:59:25.590]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:59:25.590 --> 02:59:32.858]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:59:33.539 --> 02:59:43.903]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[02:59:52.506 --> 02:59:54.047]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:54.047 --> 02:59:56.087]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.087 --> 02:59:59.309]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:21.010 --> 03:00:21.771]  We're back live.
[03:00:21.771 --> 03:00:22.732]  Hour number four.
[03:00:22.732 --> 03:00:25.034]  Randy Kelton will be back in with us again next week.
[03:00:25.034 --> 03:00:26.295]  We're going to open the phones up.
[03:00:26.295 --> 03:00:27.876]  You've got to clear the phone lines.
[03:00:27.876 --> 03:00:29.918]  Sorry to those of you who haven't gotten to another subject.
[03:00:29.918 --> 03:00:36.904]  If you're being foreclosed on, or your house was paid off and they took it, or multiple banks are trying to take it, you have quick, simple questions for Randy Kelton.
[03:00:36.904 --> 03:00:37.044]  800-259-9231.
[03:00:37.044 --> 03:00:37.184]  800-259-9231.
[03:00:37.184 --> 03:00:40.107]  But, Randy, during the one-minute break you were saying, I need to make the point that
[03:00:46.032 --> 03:00:48.993]  Right now, if you bought a home in, say, 2007 for $300,000, try to get $200,000 for it now.
[03:00:48.993 --> 03:00:51.074]  You'll get more for it here in Austin than anywhere else.
[03:01:11.311 --> 03:01:13.073]  New York, Detroit.
[03:01:13.073 --> 03:01:15.255]  Detroit, you couldn't sell it at all.
[03:01:15.255 --> 03:01:18.277]  California, you might get a hundred.
[03:01:18.277 --> 03:01:25.764]  Within a year and a half to two years, property values will drop to a third of their bubble prices.
[03:01:25.764 --> 03:01:28.607]  So, time is on your side.
[03:01:28.607 --> 03:01:34.793]  And the one thing everybody complains about in civil litigation is it takes forever!
[03:01:35.996 --> 03:01:40.157]  And as you can see, we've been talking about this for a while, but it's beginning to happen.
[03:01:40.157 --> 03:01:46.159]  The longer time goes on, the more pressure is put on the lender.
[03:01:46.159 --> 03:01:49.240]  The more the property values drop.
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:54.262]  You file suit against the lender, you've got a $300,000 property, you stop paying the lender.
[03:01:54.262 --> 03:01:57.283]  Take that money and put it in gold, silver, something hard.
[03:01:57.283 --> 03:02:02.284]  Then in a year and a half to two years, you go to the lender and say, yo, pay you what?
[03:02:02.284 --> 03:02:03.845]  Either make me a deal I can't pass up,
[03:02:04.676 --> 03:02:11.001]  Or take this property, I'll go buy the one out across the street, with the money I didn't pay you.
[03:02:11.001 --> 03:02:18.206]  So, time is on our side, and as anyone watching the news can see, pressure's on the lender.
[03:02:18.206 --> 03:02:19.007]  The heat is on.
[03:02:19.007 --> 03:02:23.510]  Yeah, they were invincible, and now Bank of America, all foreclosures halted.
[03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:25.672]  The other four major banks, all halted.
[03:02:25.672 --> 03:02:27.554]  And it's happening in Europe, too.
[03:02:27.554 --> 03:02:33.178]  Yes, and rather you use what I do, use what somebody else's does, sue them.
[03:02:33.178 --> 03:02:34.019]  Go on the internet,
[03:02:34.970 --> 03:02:36.310]  Use my favorite skill.
[03:02:36.310 --> 03:02:37.511]  Plagiarize.
[03:02:37.511 --> 03:02:40.472]  Go find suits that have been filed.
[03:02:40.472 --> 03:02:42.312]  Find the elements that match what you're doing.
[03:02:42.312 --> 03:02:46.154]  Put together a suit and sue them, but stop them.
[03:02:46.154 --> 03:02:52.095]  If you don't stop them, your children and your grandchildren are going to suffer the result of it.
[03:02:52.095 --> 03:02:59.778]  The more people we can keep in their properties, the less severe this depression is going to be and the shorter it's going to be.
[03:03:00.632 --> 03:03:06.897]  We're trying to do everything we can to stop everyone we can as fast as we can.
[03:03:06.897 --> 03:03:10.680]  So, however you do it, sue them.
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:12.162]  Good suit, bad suit.
[03:03:12.162 --> 03:03:15.705]  In the end, it matters some, but not a whole lot.
[03:03:15.705 --> 03:03:16.986]  It'll get everything stopped.
[03:03:17.731 --> 03:03:28.276]  And if you're in foreclosure, if right up the edge, if they're about to go to the courthouse steps and sell your property, go get your red manila folder, stick it full of papers, run down and around the courthouse steps.
[03:03:28.276 --> 03:03:33.198]  When they call your property, step up and wave that folder at them, tell them there's a claim against the property.
[03:03:33.198 --> 03:03:34.699]  You buy the property, you buy the claim.
[03:03:35.578 --> 03:03:40.481]  And it's been on the news, the problem with buying the property right now.
[03:03:40.481 --> 03:03:44.063]  That will stop the bank from selling to a third party.
[03:03:44.063 --> 03:03:46.685]  You do not want it to go to a third party.
[03:03:46.685 --> 03:03:49.647]  Stop that, force the bank to buy it back, sue the bank.
[03:03:49.647 --> 03:03:51.187]  Now you've stopped him.
[03:03:51.187 --> 03:03:56.070]  It doesn't statutorily stop the bank, but it realistically does.
[03:03:56.070 --> 03:03:57.671]  Because he has it now.
[03:03:57.671 --> 03:04:01.354]  If he forces you out, the property becomes empty.
[03:04:01.354 --> 03:04:03.215]  And he's responsible for maintaining it.
[03:04:04.181 --> 03:04:05.622]  And you can't insure an empty property.
[03:04:05.622 --> 03:04:08.003]  That's what's keeping everyone in the houses.
[03:04:08.003 --> 03:04:09.303]  That's the reality.
[03:04:09.303 --> 03:04:11.564]  Sue them quickly.
[03:04:11.564 --> 03:04:21.008]  As these new issues come out, the likelihood of the banks coming to the table and making a deal increase dramatically.
[03:04:21.008 --> 03:04:23.469]  And we need to stop as many as we can.
[03:04:23.469 --> 03:04:29.151]  We have about 200 in the works right now, and all but about four or five are still in their houses.
[03:04:30.655 --> 03:04:33.439]  One of my Bain people lost their house.
[03:04:33.439 --> 03:04:35.101]  But it was incredibly illegal.
[03:04:35.101 --> 03:04:36.583]  Colorado's been the worst.
[03:04:36.583 --> 03:04:38.706]  They don't care what the law says, or at least they didn't.
[03:04:39.824 --> 03:04:41.025]  They did whatever they wanted to.
[03:04:41.025 --> 03:04:47.188]  Now all of a sudden... Well, by people gumming up the courts, it is forcing this fraud out in the open.
[03:04:47.188 --> 03:05:00.256]  And instead of people just rolling over and going, okay, take my house, and the fact that banks are taking houses that are totally paid for, and they don't have the note, the fact that they were so greedy that they aren't just taking some guy who's really upside down, they're taking people where they have no claim.
[03:05:00.256 --> 03:05:01.817]  We'll be right back in a few minutes.
[03:05:02.967 --> 03:05:06.951]  You may not be thinking of lead and brass as precious metal investments.
[03:05:06.951 --> 03:05:10.474]  And you may not be thinking about ammo when we say battery station.
[03:05:10.474 --> 03:05:11.575]  But you should!
[03:05:11.575 --> 03:05:15.459]  Because battery station has a large inventory of the most popular calibers.
[03:05:15.459 --> 03:05:18.802]  Just go to batterystation.com and click on ammunition.
[03:05:18.802 --> 03:05:22.526]  There, you'll see where Second Amendment patriots invest in precious metals for .380 9mm.
[03:05:24.467 --> 03:05:32.329]  40 Cal, 45 ACP, 38 Special, .357 Magnum, .223, .30-06, .308, and more!
[03:05:32.329 --> 03:05:37.531]  Be sure to look for the October GCN Specials in blue boxes, too, at BatteryStation.com.

[03:06:01.598 --> 03:06:06.582]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:06:06.582 --> 03:06:07.563]  What have we got?
[03:06:07.563 --> 03:06:10.026]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:06:10.026 --> 03:06:11.026]  A republic.
[03:06:11.026 --> 03:06:13.669]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:06:13.669 --> 03:06:15.931]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:06:15.931 --> 03:06:17.953]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:06:17.953 --> 03:06:19.654]  So they think they own our land?
[03:06:19.654 --> 03:06:20.955]  They think they own our water?
[03:06:20.955 --> 03:06:21.576]  Children?
[03:06:21.576 --> 03:06:22.697]  Our education?
[03:06:22.697 --> 03:06:23.518]  Our money?
[03:06:23.518 --> 03:06:27.181]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:06:27.521 --> 03:06:32.508]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:06:32.508 --> 03:06:33.529]  We have the facts.
[03:06:33.529 --> 03:06:34.690]  We have the Constitution.
[03:06:34.690 --> 03:06:35.592]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:06:35.592 --> 03:06:36.473]  We have common law.
[03:06:36.473 --> 03:06:39.016]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:39.016 --> 03:06:41.960]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[03:06:41.960 --> 03:06:42.781]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:06:42.881 --> 03:06:47.843]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:06:47.843 --> 03:06:49.344]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:06:49.344 --> 03:06:50.424]  Don't tread on me.
[03:06:50.424 --> 03:06:57.287]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:07:01.417 --> 03:07:04.782]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:07:04.782 --> 03:07:08.707]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:07:08.707 --> 03:07:12.433]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:07:12.433 --> 03:07:17.360]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[03:07:17.580 --> 03:07:21.424]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.

[03:08:03.143 --> 03:08:09.776]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.776 --> 03:08:12.762]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:22.526 --> 03:08:26.808]  Now, Randy's been traveling all over the country, battling these people, doing seminars.
[03:08:26.808 --> 03:08:34.913]  He's got his own radio show, but he's developing and working on it for years, you know, a system to try to quantify all this, but it's changing so fast.
[03:08:34.913 --> 03:08:38.315]  But in the next few days, there's going to be more information up on the site.
[03:08:38.315 --> 03:08:42.377]  It's a great URL, and give people the URL to find out more.
[03:08:45.216 --> 03:08:46.017]  Mortgage Crimes.
[03:08:46.017 --> 03:08:48.078]  MortgageCrime.com.
[03:08:48.078 --> 03:08:49.839]  You guys just launched it a few days ago.
[03:08:49.839 --> 03:08:51.961]  We just launched this one.
[03:08:51.961 --> 03:08:56.103]  Go to MortgageCrime.com if you're interested in more information.
[03:08:56.103 --> 03:08:58.725]  You can put in email and some contact information.
[03:08:58.725 --> 03:09:01.387]  We'll get back to you, get you all the information you need.
[03:09:01.607 --> 03:09:02.889]  Sorry I just sprung that on you.
[03:09:02.889 --> 03:09:04.631]  You weren't ready to talk about it until next week.
[03:09:04.631 --> 03:09:04.972]  Yes.
[03:09:04.972 --> 03:09:08.236]  Yeah, but mortgagecrimes.com to find out more.
[03:09:08.236 --> 03:09:10.639]  And again, you're dealing with criminal courts.
[03:09:10.639 --> 03:09:11.841]  You're dealing with a corrupt system.
[03:09:11.841 --> 03:09:15.546]  I go back to Bloomberg two months ago and again two weeks ago.
[03:09:15.546 --> 03:09:18.870]  Reports were prudential admitted in court, which is another variant of these banks.
[03:09:19.651 --> 03:09:35.596]  That they and many other major insurance companies made a deal 11 years ago, right when they got rid of Glass-Steagall, to have contracts that they're allowed to break with the 6,000 dead and dying veterans from World War II up to today, and they just take their insurance money.
[03:09:35.596 --> 03:09:38.337]  Just like they're announcing, oh, we fired you from this job.
[03:09:38.337 --> 03:09:40.637]  You've been here 7 years, 10 years, 20 years.
[03:09:40.637 --> 03:09:43.238]  We're not going to give you your pension money now.
[03:09:43.238 --> 03:09:45.099]  You didn't read the fine print we changed.
[03:09:45.099 --> 03:09:48.980]  And I've seen them in the last 6 years changing all these rules, but they're not laws.
[03:09:49.660 --> 03:09:55.983]  And so the courts are there, these are politicians, they're just there to ram through whatever they're told to do.
[03:09:55.983 --> 03:09:58.084]  People are standing up and saying no.
[03:09:58.084 --> 03:10:16.213]  Now give me an example, because you're talking about just any suit to block them for a while, but it varies case to case, but a few case point examples of an average mortgage with what they're doing, they've lied in the fees, they've lied in how they sold the note to others, they don't have the original note, they don't have standing.
[03:10:16.213 --> 03:10:17.514]  Let's say Randy Kelton owned a $300,000 house.
[03:10:19.535 --> 03:10:23.238]  And you were three months behind and they were starting procedures to foreclose.
[03:10:23.238 --> 03:10:24.419]  What would you do?
[03:10:24.419 --> 03:10:30.423]  First thing I would do is determine the fraud they committed when they created the note.
[03:10:30.423 --> 03:10:34.866]  Get you a good dollar figure to come into court with.
[03:10:34.866 --> 03:10:38.369]  And then look on the internet.
[03:10:38.369 --> 03:10:42.372]  There's plenty of information on how to make an argument that
[03:10:43.453 --> 03:10:47.914]  You have not proven that you have authority to raise this issue.
[03:10:47.914 --> 03:10:58.117]  And again, you've got all this on your computer, and we were going to show it today, but we're going to do it next week because it's so complex, because I want to load it as exhibits into our computers so we can just pull it up on screen, not just aim a camera at the screen.
[03:10:58.117 --> 03:10:59.498]  Yes.
[03:10:59.498 --> 03:11:08.340]  I have a very large spreadsheet that I use to work out the fraud claim against the lender.
[03:11:08.340 --> 03:11:10.081]  And frankly, in using it,
[03:11:11.243 --> 03:11:15.467]  We use every stinking, rotten, low-down lawyer trick we can find.
[03:11:15.467 --> 03:11:19.531]  There's something real satisfying about turning this back on these guys.
[03:11:19.531 --> 03:11:23.014]  And they seem to be very accommodating.
[03:11:23.014 --> 03:11:26.678]  They seem to go out of their way to see how stupid they can be.
[03:11:26.678 --> 03:11:29.441]  And we greatly appreciate that, and I want to thank them for it.
[03:11:30.373 --> 03:11:33.416]  Well, they've been getting away with murder for so long, they're arrogant.
[03:11:33.416 --> 03:11:35.038]  They're arrogant and they're accustomed to it.
[03:11:35.038 --> 03:11:37.361]  Now all of a sudden, the tide is changing.
[03:11:37.361 --> 03:11:38.742]  We have an opportunity.
[03:11:38.742 --> 03:11:41.766]  Yeah, people have just begun to fight and it's frozen them.
[03:11:41.766 --> 03:11:47.692]  Originally, when I first started this, 95% of all mortgages went uncontested.
[03:11:47.692 --> 03:11:48.974]  The last figure I saw was 53%.
[03:11:51.175 --> 03:11:54.518]  The courts are getting flooded with suits.
[03:11:54.518 --> 03:12:01.464]  And that's the best thing to help us because the courts are going to be going to these lenders and say, you gotta do something to get these out of my court.
[03:12:01.464 --> 03:12:08.391]  And that's going to develop more test cases to find out what's the real Achilles heel.
[03:12:08.391 --> 03:12:14.016]  Yes, and part of the difficulty were the judges.
[03:12:14.016 --> 03:12:17.259]  The judges were accustomed to ruling a certain way.
[03:12:18.573 --> 03:12:21.754]  And judges are terrified about making precedent.
[03:12:21.754 --> 03:12:26.134]  They don't want to be the one that the Supreme Court overrules.
[03:12:26.134 --> 03:12:29.995]  So they would tend to rule the way other judges have ruled.
[03:12:29.995 --> 03:12:31.815]  Well now that tide is changing.
[03:12:31.815 --> 03:12:34.136]  We have more and more ruling in our favor.
[03:12:34.136 --> 03:12:36.096]  And there's precedence against the banks now.
[03:12:36.096 --> 03:12:37.096]  Exactly.
[03:12:37.096 --> 03:12:38.456]  And it's building.
[03:12:38.456 --> 03:12:42.357]  Every week we have more judges ruling against the lenders.
[03:12:42.357 --> 03:12:44.417]  This is a tide that's building.
[03:12:44.417 --> 03:12:45.818]  And we have an opportunity here.
[03:12:47.598 --> 03:12:51.961]  I'm here because I want everybody to stop their mortgage, stop their foreclosure.
[03:12:51.961 --> 03:12:54.123]  Whether you use me, somebody else, I don't care.
[03:12:54.123 --> 03:12:57.485]  I got more business than I can do, but do something.
[03:12:57.485 --> 03:13:00.467]  Do not let these people steal your property.
[03:13:00.467 --> 03:13:01.668]  So, I mean, quantify it simply.
[03:13:01.668 --> 03:13:07.672]  I know each case is different, but, but, uh, so they've, you know, they've lied on the, uh, where they sold the mortgage.
[03:13:07.672 --> 03:13:09.553]  They've lied that they, that they have standing.
[03:13:09.553 --> 03:13:12.455]  They've lied that they, uh, you know, have that chain of title.
[03:13:12.455 --> 03:13:15.277]  Uh, they've lied in the fines and fees and broken the law.
[03:13:15.277 --> 03:13:15.778]  What do you do?
[03:13:16.946 --> 03:13:23.052]  We charged him initially with civil fraud on a number of counts.
[03:13:23.052 --> 03:13:26.035]  It's just too complex to get in all the issues.
[03:13:26.035 --> 03:13:34.322]  You have the Truth in Lending Act, which is generally too late to claim after three years, but we can still go back after them for common law fraud.
[03:13:35.273 --> 03:13:43.941]  For fraud by non-disclosure, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of good faith and fair dealing.
[03:13:43.941 --> 03:13:49.466]  In each of the states there are... There's a whole family of fraud with brokerage firms, banks, assessors and others.
[03:13:49.466 --> 03:13:54.130]  They're held to a higher standard when they use your ignorance against you.
[03:13:54.130 --> 03:13:55.371]  Absolutely.
[03:13:55.371 --> 03:14:01.276]  Most people, when they go into a foreclosure issue or a mortgage issue, they only deal with licensed professionals.
[03:14:02.276 --> 03:14:05.639]  You deal with licensed professionals who are licensed by the government.
[03:14:05.639 --> 03:14:19.709]  You have a reasonable expectation of good faith and fair dealing from those people, and they turned out our government's supervisory role was just non-existent.
[03:14:19.709 --> 03:14:23.952]  They allowed them to do anything they wanted, but that's changing now.
[03:14:24.907 --> 03:14:27.789]  Now we can actually get these adjudicated.
[03:14:27.789 --> 03:14:50.143]  We actually had one case thrown out here in Austin by a certain judge, federal judge, whose name starts with an S, ends with a K, but ends with an S, but I won't mention his name, threatened a client with sanctions if he didn't take out every reference to criminal acts by the defendants.
[03:14:50.143 --> 03:14:52.905]  I was astounded.
[03:14:52.905 --> 03:14:53.886]  We're going to prepare
[03:14:55.578 --> 03:14:59.821]  Tampering with a witness, obstruction of justice against the judge.
[03:14:59.821 --> 03:15:01.463]  So you want to dance?
[03:15:01.463 --> 03:15:03.624]  Well, now we get to lead.
[03:15:03.624 --> 03:15:07.207]  But there are a few judges who haven't got it yet.
[03:15:07.207 --> 03:15:14.633]  But most of them around the country are beginning to realize that the political tide is changing.
[03:15:14.633 --> 03:15:17.615]  That the lenders have committed fraud on every case.
[03:15:17.615 --> 03:15:20.337]  And primarily what you've got, fraud on the front end,
[03:15:21.223 --> 03:15:24.409]  They lied to you in every case.
[03:15:24.409 --> 03:15:27.194]  The broker who brought the loan to you lied to you.
[03:15:27.194 --> 03:15:30.459]  That's enough to get the whole contract thrown out.
[03:15:30.459 --> 03:15:31.641]  The lender lied to you.
[03:15:33.052 --> 03:15:34.452]  The appraiser lied to you.
[03:15:34.452 --> 03:15:36.413]  The trustee lied to you.
[03:15:36.413 --> 03:15:37.433]  Everybody lied to you.
[03:15:37.433 --> 03:15:46.656]  People should have known when the appraiser and the broker and the bank comes and says, lie honey, put this house is worth more, put on here you make more.
[03:15:46.656 --> 03:15:50.057]  You should know if they're telling you to lie, they're lying to you.
[03:15:50.057 --> 03:15:55.859]  And when the bank told you, oh you can't hire an appraiser, we have to do that.
[03:15:55.859 --> 03:15:57.359]  Only the banks can hire appraisers.
[03:15:57.359 --> 03:15:59.380]  That should be a great red flag.
[03:16:00.595 --> 03:16:05.426]  And it's worse than we've had time to produce here.
[03:16:05.426 --> 03:16:08.995]  They produced that overinflated appraisal
[03:16:11.613 --> 03:16:17.814]  So that they could defraud the bankruptcy courts and the IRS on the back end.
[03:16:17.814 --> 03:16:21.635]  You ever notice how all of these mortgage companies are going out of business?
[03:16:21.635 --> 03:16:25.616]  They're creating a fortune in illegal income and they keep bankrupting.
[03:16:25.616 --> 03:16:28.717]  They move it out the back door.
[03:16:28.717 --> 03:16:33.098]  We had a rich dad poor dad on and he explained that's how this is all done.
[03:16:33.098 --> 03:16:36.778]  They just keep rolling the debt while the profit goes out the back door.
[03:16:36.778 --> 03:16:39.779]  They get this overinflated appraisal
[03:16:40.919 --> 03:16:48.242]  And then they take the product and when the mortgage company sells the security instrument to the special purpose vehicle...
[03:16:49.181 --> 03:16:55.966]  It's not an arm's length transaction as is generally the special purpose vehicle actually owns the mortgage company.
[03:16:55.966 --> 03:17:07.094]  And the mortgage company then reduces the value of the property to the proper value and shows a great loss on it when he sells it to the security, to the special purpose vehicle.
[03:17:07.094 --> 03:17:11.237]  He takes a loss on every transaction and he goes out of business.
[03:17:11.237 --> 03:17:12.899]  And he hides all this extra profit.
[03:17:13.806 --> 03:17:24.313]  He uses the bankruptcy courts to go out of business and lose all his debt and thereby defrauds the IRS in the process.
[03:17:24.313 --> 03:17:30.076]  Every single step that I've looked at... Well, I mean, but that's what our guest was saying.
[03:17:30.076 --> 03:17:36.280]  He's saying the elite have written these rules for themselves and then they control the regulators so they're always allowed to get away with it.
[03:17:36.280 --> 03:17:40.283]  We had a judge in California tell a litigant
[03:17:41.388 --> 03:17:51.711]  You need to get this to the federal court, because the banks have so arranged the laws in California, you have absolutely no chance.
[03:17:51.711 --> 03:17:52.452]  That's another issue.
[03:17:52.452 --> 03:17:53.872]  You go right to federal court.
[03:17:53.872 --> 03:17:55.313]  Yes, we go right to federal court.
[03:17:55.313 --> 03:17:59.814]  Primary reason is, people are terrified of the courts.
[03:17:59.814 --> 03:18:02.095]  They're terrified of the banks.
[03:18:02.095 --> 03:18:04.896]  And when you walk into a federal court, pro se,
[03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:12.032]  People come away amazed at how professional, how polite, and how helpful they are.
[03:18:12.032 --> 03:18:17.173]  It actually gives you some confidence that there is something you can do.
[03:18:17.173 --> 03:18:18.914]  Because there is!
[03:18:18.914 --> 03:18:22.595]  Helps you get over the propaganda.
[03:18:22.595 --> 03:18:26.816]  The more we go after them, the more the courts will start ruling in our favor.
[03:18:26.816 --> 03:18:27.536]  And it's happening.
[03:18:27.536 --> 03:18:32.538]  We're up to almost 50% of all the foreclosures are being resisted.
[03:18:33.553 --> 03:18:35.216]  All this easy profit's going away.
[03:18:35.216 --> 03:18:39.783]  Now if we can get people to start filing criminal charges against these lenders...
[03:18:40.803 --> 03:18:42.485]  That will bring them to the table.
[03:18:42.485 --> 03:18:44.246]  Well, that's what Ron Paul and many others have said.
[03:18:44.246 --> 03:18:47.069]  He said he's talking about the state grand juries and others.
[03:18:47.069 --> 03:18:52.733]  It's up to us, we the people, to politically demand that the law be enforced and that these crooks go to jail.
[03:18:52.733 --> 03:18:54.935]  That would end this all out of hand very quickly.
[03:18:54.935 --> 03:18:58.038]  Yes, and we have a plan to get that done.
[03:18:58.038 --> 03:19:05.905]  The judges and the prosecutors don't want to go after the banks because the banks invest a lot of money in their campaign funds.
[03:19:07.031 --> 03:19:18.636]  However, if we can put the judge on a legal dime... You know, I tell people in my seminars, when I do process seminars, when I walk into a courthouse, I'm the baddest motor scooter in the building.
[03:19:18.636 --> 03:19:21.297]  And there's only one reason I am.
[03:19:21.297 --> 03:19:23.138]  Because I'm nobody.
[03:19:23.138 --> 03:19:31.042]  I'm not a prosecutor, a lawyer, a clerk, a... Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.
[03:19:31.042 --> 03:19:31.302]  Well...
[03:19:32.296 --> 03:19:34.136]  I'm the citizen.
[03:19:34.136 --> 03:19:39.918]  The highest guy in the place, the judge, has no claim on me whatsoever.
[03:19:39.918 --> 03:19:45.079]  As a citizen walking into the courthouse, I'm the only one that can climb right down his throat.
[03:19:45.079 --> 03:19:50.960]  I can drag him in front of a grand jury and there's nothing he can do about it, and they do not want you to know that.
[03:19:50.960 --> 03:19:54.381]  That's right, the lawyers are all part of the bar and inside baseball.
[03:19:54.381 --> 03:19:56.242]  They're all playing golf together.
[03:19:56.242 --> 03:19:56.462]  Exactly.
[03:19:56.462 --> 03:19:57.782]  All right, we'll be right back, Randy.
[03:19:57.782 --> 03:19:58.002]  Stay there.
[03:19:58.002 --> 03:19:59.362]  We're going to take phone calls when we come back.
[03:19:59.362 --> 03:20:00.623]  We'll do part two next week.
[03:20:00.623 --> 03:20:01.603]  This is all powerful info.
[03:20:02.173 --> 03:20:05.757]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[03:20:05.757 --> 03:20:06.878]  It ended on June of 2009.
[03:20:06.878 --> 03:20:11.443]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[03:20:11.443 --> 03:20:17.390]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[03:20:17.390 --> 03:20:19.552]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[03:20:19.552 --> 03:20:22.215]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[03:20:22.555 --> 03:20:29.060]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[03:20:29.060 --> 03:20:31.281]  They both make fabulous investments.
[03:20:31.281 --> 03:20:36.605]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[03:20:36.605 --> 03:20:41.909]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[03:20:41.909 --> 03:20:47.053]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[03:20:47.253 --> 03:20:50.455]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[03:20:50.455 --> 03:20:53.457]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[03:20:53.457 --> 03:20:54.218]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[03:21:01.522 --> 03:21:05.425]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[03:21:05.425 --> 03:21:09.248]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[03:21:47.162 --> 03:21:48.003]  We're good to go.
[03:22:05.737 --> 03:22:06.998]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:06.998 --> 03:22:10.923]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:10.923 --> 03:22:13.165]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:13.165 --> 03:22:19.031]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:22:19.031 --> 03:22:25.278]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:25.698 --> 03:22:31.679]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:22:31.679 --> 03:22:35.840]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:40.141]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:22:40.141 --> 03:22:46.082]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:46.082 --> 03:22:49.642]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:49.642 --> 03:22:51.603]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:51.603 --> 03:22:52.043]  It's here.

[03:24:15.389 --> 03:24:19.554]  Randy, next week's going to have, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and radio listeners, it'll be archived as well.
[03:24:19.554 --> 03:24:22.197]  It's going to be back in with us next, I think Thursday.
[03:24:22.697 --> 03:24:24.179]  Thursday's a good day.
[03:24:24.179 --> 03:24:26.120]  One to three again, we'll do two hours.
[03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:28.282]  Because there's just so much of this to cover.
[03:24:28.282 --> 03:24:38.672]  But to quantify it, and correct me if I'm wrong, if people go in and beg the lender, or beg the mortgage broker, or just call the police, that doesn't do anything because they know you're ignorant.
[03:24:38.672 --> 03:24:40.373]  And most of them are ignorant too.
[03:24:40.373 --> 03:24:41.995]  It's just a system of ignorance.
[03:24:41.995 --> 03:24:44.958]  It's at the top that it's all been thought out.
[03:24:45.518 --> 03:24:54.201]  But by suing, or by filing motions, you now put it into a whole other arena where they actually have to at least address the law at certain levels.
[03:24:54.201 --> 03:25:04.185]  And so there's a record, and that stalls them, so at least you're not having to pay your rent while you're in there, and the market's going down, so they're losing in the end.
[03:25:04.185 --> 03:25:05.485]  Precisely.
[03:25:05.485 --> 03:25:09.567]  Once you take them on, there are a lot of different supposed
[03:25:10.629 --> 03:25:11.671]  Ways of dealing with it.
[03:25:11.671 --> 03:25:16.838]  One of the things that a lot of people are doing are administrative procedures.
[03:25:16.838 --> 03:25:23.907]  Administrative procedures look great on paper, but the lender will just ignore them because they have no legal teeth.
[03:25:24.949 --> 03:25:28.993]  Until you drag them into court with a summons, you don't have their attention.
[03:25:28.993 --> 03:25:30.715]  You're physically taking their time now.
[03:25:30.715 --> 03:25:31.315]  Exactly.
[03:25:31.315 --> 03:25:36.681]  And now, especially, we're taking an approach that normally isn't taken.
[03:25:36.681 --> 03:25:40.324]  We're taking on the criminal side as well as the civil.
[03:25:41.689 --> 03:25:46.073]  This judge here in Austin who saw it, really didn't like it the first time he saw it.
[03:25:46.073 --> 03:25:49.597]  Well, sorry Bubba, that ain't gonna get better.
[03:25:49.597 --> 03:25:52.339]  We're gonna introduce him to the criminal side.
[03:25:52.339 --> 03:25:56.423]  You know the cigarette companies, the government sued them three times.
[03:25:56.423 --> 03:26:03.249]  The cigarette companies had bottomless pockets and beat them three times until they came back with Rico.
[03:26:04.226 --> 03:26:09.115]  And then the executives said, whoa, hold on here.
[03:26:09.115 --> 03:26:10.658]  We can go to jail over this one.
[03:26:10.658 --> 03:26:12.181]  Now all of a sudden they come to the table.
[03:26:13.320 --> 03:26:17.403]  And we intend to start bringing them to the table by bringing them before Greg.
[03:26:17.403 --> 03:26:25.430]  Because if they broke the law on the fees, and they broke the law on trying to come to take your house when they don't have the note, and the list just goes on, you've got them.
[03:26:25.430 --> 03:26:26.531]  Resistance is victory.
[03:26:26.531 --> 03:26:28.412]  It doesn't mean everybody's going to win.
[03:26:28.412 --> 03:26:32.535]  It means everybody standing up, or even a big percentage, I'll bring them to their knees.
[03:26:32.535 --> 03:26:36.819]  They're already near their knees right now, suspending most foreclosures.
[03:26:36.819 --> 03:26:40.282]  Yes, and this has only happened because people were resisting.
[03:26:40.922 --> 03:26:43.983]  People were fighting them, people were bringing them to court and making them angry.
[03:26:43.983 --> 03:26:48.526]  And because you're following the law, they've got to go to Congress to try to get the law changed.
[03:26:48.526 --> 03:26:53.648]  But is Congress going to make the decision to say, okay, fraud's the limit, you can do anything you want?
[03:26:53.648 --> 03:26:55.289]  That will destroy the entire system.
[03:26:55.289 --> 03:26:57.630]  So that's, it's really... You've got a problem.
[03:26:57.630 --> 03:27:00.531]  A while back I was in North Carolina.
[03:27:00.531 --> 03:27:03.993]  There was a primary runoff, two incumbents in the runoff.
[03:27:04.924 --> 03:27:11.806]  It was clear the only reason they made the runoff was because so many people ran against them, they split the vote against them.
[03:27:11.806 --> 03:27:16.348]  They lost terribly in the runoff and the exit polls all said the same thing.
[03:27:16.348 --> 03:27:19.089]  They voted for the bailout.
[03:27:19.089 --> 03:27:21.570]  Congress can hear the toilet flushing.
[03:27:21.570 --> 03:27:24.831]  We have an incredible opportunity right now.
[03:27:24.831 --> 03:27:27.612]  And with them turning on the lenders,
[03:27:28.840 --> 03:27:35.461]  Once we get a new set of representatives in, this could be the one where everybody gets flushed.
[03:27:35.461 --> 03:27:42.282]  Now, I understand we'll elect more politicians and they're corrupt, but it takes them a while to get organized.
[03:27:42.282 --> 03:27:46.323]  And in that period in between, we have opportunity for some great change.
[03:27:46.323 --> 03:27:50.464]  Our ancestors have whooped tyranny over and over again because they had a fighting spirit.
[03:27:50.464 --> 03:27:52.344]  And when you got right on your side, you can't be stopped.
[03:27:52.344 --> 03:27:54.525]  Let's take a first call before we get a break here.
[03:27:54.525 --> 03:27:56.345]  Bill in Florida, you're on the air with Randy Kelton.
[03:27:56.345 --> 03:27:56.665]  Go ahead.
[03:27:57.506 --> 03:27:58.627]  Hi, how are you doing?
[03:27:58.627 --> 03:27:59.148]  Good.
[03:27:59.148 --> 03:28:00.189]  You know, it's amazing.
[03:28:00.189 --> 03:28:05.574]  Everywhere you turn, you just see more and more and more.
[03:28:05.574 --> 03:28:18.788]  My concern, though, is, in all sincerity, when this gets to the level of the water rising so much, and it creates the backlog, because don't forget, when the economic thing came to a halt in September 2008,
[03:28:20.689 --> 03:28:25.133]  It was Hank Paulson that marched over to the White House and said, Mr. President, we have a problem.
[03:28:25.133 --> 03:28:28.156]  Oh, he said we're going to have martial law and blood in the streets.
[03:28:28.156 --> 03:28:29.217]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[03:28:29.217 --> 03:28:39.186]  And then on that original TARP note that was submitted, the very language that was used on the TARP note was picked up out of one of the last executive orders.
[03:28:39.186 --> 03:28:46.933]  And if you go to Google and just type in FEMA and executive orders and read... Yeah, during any emergency, including financial, they can suspend the Congress.
[03:28:48.047 --> 03:28:48.488]  Exactly.
[03:28:48.488 --> 03:28:51.673]  Congress isn't even allowed to review it for six months.
[03:28:51.673 --> 03:28:52.896]  Yep.
[03:28:52.896 --> 03:28:55.340]  Okay, so at that point in time...
[03:28:56.312 --> 03:28:58.794]  What, what actually transpires?
[03:28:58.794 --> 03:29:02.718]  Well, we're forcing them to come out with total naked tyranny.
[03:29:02.718 --> 03:29:04.359]  See, I mean, look, they're tyrants.
[03:29:04.359 --> 03:29:05.560]  They're coming down on us.
[03:29:05.560 --> 03:29:10.445]  We can lay down or we can get up and say, I don't know who's going to win this, but I'm, I'm opening a can.
[03:29:10.445 --> 03:29:11.365]  Let's go.
[03:29:11.365 --> 03:29:13.387]  I mean, you know, I mean, that's what it comes down to.
[03:29:13.387 --> 03:29:16.690]  I'm going to force you to come right out in the open.
[03:29:16.690 --> 03:29:22.155]  All my point is when it, when it, when it backs up to the point that that panic has come about,
[03:29:22.904 --> 03:29:23.784]  Bill, stay there!
[03:29:23.784 --> 03:29:26.885]  This is exactly how we opened this interview an hour and a half ago.
[03:29:26.885 --> 03:29:31.386]  And you're absolutely right about this, but they were going to do that anyway.
[03:29:31.386 --> 03:29:34.407]  But let's talk to you more on the other side and get Randy's take on what you're talking about.
[03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:56.075]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.075 --> 03:29:58.739]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.966 --> 03:30:05.447]  In confusing times, would a simple outlook on health and beauty make sense?
[03:30:05.447 --> 03:30:11.670]  If you're tired of taking dry vitamins without noticing any results, then the Bogdana Nutritional Formula is for you.
[03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:13.071]  Easy to take and absorb.
[03:30:13.071 --> 03:30:18.093]  The absorption of liquids is 98% in comparison to only 20% for dry vitamins.
[03:30:18.093 --> 03:30:23.535]  For the past 25 years, Bogdana Rejuvenating Nutritional Formula has been proven to get results.
[03:30:23.535 --> 03:30:23.915]  Detox.

[03:30:31.520 --> 03:30:34.162]  And a one-month supply is less than a dollar per day.

[03:31:01.536 --> 03:31:03.918]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:03.918 --> 03:31:06.240]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:06.240 --> 03:31:09.363]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:09.363 --> 03:31:14.567]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:14.567 --> 03:31:18.751]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:19.071 --> 03:31:21.414]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:21.414 --> 03:31:24.297]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:24.297 --> 03:31:27.220]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:27.220 --> 03:31:34.829]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:35.149 --> 03:31:40.534]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:40.534 --> 03:31:42.857]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:42.857 --> 03:31:47.081]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:47.081 --> 03:31:48.162]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:48.162 --> 03:31:49.503]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:49.503 --> 03:31:50.984]  Invisible Empire.

[03:33:05.642 --> 03:33:13.343]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:25.913 --> 03:33:27.334]  They're going to build more onto the site.
[03:33:27.334 --> 03:33:33.978]  He's got some other sites that deal with other legal issues he's had for years, and it's Radio Show, but they're going to be adding and building the next week.
[03:33:33.978 --> 03:33:41.503]  They weren't going to launch it until next week, but you can sign on to a mailing list, or if you've got any questions or want to talk to Randy, give folks that website.
[03:33:42.113 --> 03:33:45.776]  Yes, that's mortgagecrime.com.
[03:33:45.776 --> 03:33:47.557]  Mortgagecrime.com.
[03:33:47.557 --> 03:33:49.558]  Mortgagecrime.com.
[03:33:49.558 --> 03:33:59.005]  Now, I want to go back to the calls to Bill, Steve, Ben, Kathy, and many others that are patiently holding there with specific questions for you, but what he raises is central.
[03:33:59.005 --> 03:34:03.408]  That's how we started the interview, was they're already going to Congress trying to get a blank check
[03:34:03.928 --> 03:34:06.951]  Just like with the bailout money, they could do whatever they wanted with it and it was all secret.
[03:34:06.951 --> 03:34:13.777]  Now the SEC and the banker reorganization of this year has more secrecy, can't get in trouble for protecting Madoff.
[03:34:13.777 --> 03:34:16.299]  But again, that's open more fraud.
[03:34:16.299 --> 03:34:17.960]  That's open tyranny.
[03:34:17.960 --> 03:34:20.282]  And so yes, they have sold this.
[03:34:20.282 --> 03:34:22.044]  They've meant to make it unravel.
[03:34:22.044 --> 03:34:24.546]  They were going to do it regardless.
[03:34:24.546 --> 03:34:26.728]  And so, I mean, what do you say to what Bill was stating?
[03:34:27.418 --> 03:34:31.822]  Well, if it's gonna come out, we need it to come out now.
[03:34:31.822 --> 03:34:40.189]  I've been doing a radio show for several years, and I see the individual's perspective changing.
[03:34:40.189 --> 03:34:43.552]  There used to be a lot of talk about people who are asleep, people who are awake.
[03:34:43.552 --> 03:34:45.233]  I never hear that anymore.
[03:34:45.233 --> 03:34:48.175]  This sleeping giant's waking up, and he is not happy.
[03:34:48.175 --> 03:34:49.557]  The question is, how awake are they?
[03:34:50.477 --> 03:34:51.778]  It's degrees.
[03:34:51.778 --> 03:34:58.162]  But with the kind of publicity we've been getting lately, this is going to be waking everyone up.
[03:34:58.162 --> 03:35:01.764]  And there was one report I found most comforting.
[03:35:01.764 --> 03:35:16.273]  There was a report that they were concerned that the United States, in the last year, had purchased more weapons than all three of the largest armies in the world combined.
[03:35:17.878 --> 03:35:18.739]  Good news.
[03:35:39.736 --> 03:35:40.176]  Well, you know, the
[03:36:02.757 --> 03:36:14.406]  If you look back, and in my troubles, by the way, I sent an email to Jaron, your producer there yesterday, and I also left a phone number, because I'd love to talk to you after the fact.
[03:36:14.406 --> 03:36:18.929]  I left a phone number with Janet over there at GCN.
[03:36:18.929 --> 03:36:31.598]  My concern, and I really say this genuinely, I grew up in Manhattan, and I'm aware of a lot of things that transpired there, and their Trojan horse was the fact of the
[03:36:32.730 --> 03:36:39.454]  535 four-color covered, published books that were put on all of Congress.
[03:36:39.454 --> 03:36:41.635]  And that was the Patriot Act.
[03:36:41.635 --> 03:36:43.997]  And that was their Trojan horse.
[03:36:43.997 --> 03:36:50.100]  And they were told, don't read it, don't debate it, don't review it, sign it.
[03:36:50.100 --> 03:36:57.624]  Now those books were put on their desk two weeks after 9-1-1.
[03:36:57.624 --> 03:36:59.906]  And the average person doesn't even think about that.
[03:36:59.906 --> 03:37:00.386]  Two weeks!
[03:37:00.865 --> 03:37:04.266]  No, it had already been written, yeah.
[03:37:04.266 --> 03:37:08.168]  But I mean, so from your view, what would you do, Bill?
[03:37:08.168 --> 03:37:11.149]  Do people just let them take houses that are even paid for?
[03:37:11.149 --> 03:37:12.350]  I mean, just give them everything?
[03:37:12.350 --> 03:37:13.570]  No, no.
[03:37:13.570 --> 03:37:17.492]  I think what needs to be dealt with is to stop the Trojan Horse.
[03:37:17.492 --> 03:37:22.814]  They attempted this back, and they approved it for a period of a while, and then it got rescinded.
[03:37:22.814 --> 03:37:29.937]  And McCarran did the Internal Security Act, and he was a senator that was good buddies with McCarthy.
[03:37:31.256 --> 03:37:38.701]  And, you know, here they've still kept the name at the airport in Las Vegas, named after him, McCarran International.
[03:37:38.701 --> 03:37:41.803]  And that act was repealed within a year later.
[03:37:41.803 --> 03:37:44.125]  The majority, probably 95-98% of it, was based... it was unconstitutional.
[03:37:48.604 --> 03:37:54.988]  Sure, you're saying they're going to try to use the martial law, secret police system to enforce this and there's no way they're going to get away with it.
[03:37:54.988 --> 03:38:00.672]  I mean, they're not going to be able to blow stuff up and say people that don't want to hand over their houses are the terrorists.
[03:38:00.672 --> 03:38:03.514]  I mean, they politically don't have the will.
[03:38:03.514 --> 03:38:05.515]  We know we're going down this road.
[03:38:05.515 --> 03:38:08.257]  We can lay down to them or we can stand up and expose their fraud.
[03:38:08.257 --> 03:38:10.138]  But I see what you're saying.
[03:38:10.138 --> 03:38:11.118]  Any comments on that, Randy?
[03:38:11.118 --> 03:38:11.959]  Then we're going back to calls.
[03:38:12.383 --> 03:38:16.745]  Well, I'm as afraid of the Military Commissions Act as anybody else is.
[03:38:16.745 --> 03:38:19.447]  When I read it, it terrified me.
[03:38:19.447 --> 03:38:22.368]  And what else do we do?
[03:38:22.368 --> 03:38:25.230]  Do we stand by and watch it go by?
[03:38:25.230 --> 03:38:29.192]  Or do we stand up and give them reason not to try to... Hey, we're the good guys!
[03:38:29.192 --> 03:38:33.515]  And if I'm here exposing tyranny and they come shoot me in the head, that's just the way it is!
[03:38:33.515 --> 03:38:39.218]  I mean, at a certain point, you just gotta man up and say, look, you're a bunch of criminal nutcases, and it's over!
[03:38:40.018 --> 03:38:42.560]  I mean, they're so arrogant, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:51.488]  They're so arrogant that they're taking the death benefits, the insurance of six million veterans, and signed a secret deal, now public, and that's not a big issue?
[03:38:51.488 --> 03:38:54.290]  I mean, none of us are safe with these people.
[03:38:54.290 --> 03:38:56.112]  These are madmen.
[03:38:56.112 --> 03:38:58.534]  They're just full of arrogance.
[03:38:58.534 --> 03:39:00.795]  Yes, and I see the political
[03:39:02.092 --> 03:39:03.712]  Nature of the public changing.
[03:39:03.712 --> 03:39:05.513]  People are getting upset.
[03:39:05.513 --> 03:39:13.595]  And I'm a veteran, and I've dealt with veteran groups, and I felt like the veterans seemed to be the most whipped group in the country.
[03:39:13.595 --> 03:39:17.996]  But when I've talked to veterans lately, they are really getting P.O.'d.
[03:39:17.996 --> 03:39:24.577]  And I suspect when you get all the veterans groups up and active, that they will change a lot themselves.
[03:39:24.577 --> 03:39:30.899]  There are a lot of pressures moving to neutralize the kinds of injustices these people are trying to do.
[03:39:32.508 --> 03:39:36.751]  For the first time in a long time, I'm beginning to have some confidence.
[03:39:36.751 --> 03:39:38.553]  Well, look at New Hampshire.
[03:39:38.553 --> 03:39:41.075]  They put out a false report that he was a convicted person.
[03:39:41.075 --> 03:39:42.456]  Wasn't true.
[03:39:42.456 --> 03:39:45.798]  Everybody thought he wasn't going to get the baby back, and the Irish has got the baby back.
[03:39:45.798 --> 03:39:47.859]  Because the system's getting scared.
[03:39:47.859 --> 03:39:51.042]  Also, a lot of judges are looking around and going, am I on the right side of this?
[03:39:51.843 --> 03:40:06.654]  Yes, and the Supreme Court in Connecticut is hearing a case where the Attorney General threw out the ballots for the Libertarian Party candidates.
[03:40:06.654 --> 03:40:10.237]  A week before the final date, they claimed they lost everything.
[03:40:10.237 --> 03:40:13.079]  They've been throwing the overseas military ballots out everywhere.
[03:40:13.599 --> 03:40:20.290]  And Dan Real went after him, pro se, filed his pleadings with the court.
[03:40:20.290 --> 03:40:23.034]  The Attorney General didn't answer.
[03:40:23.034 --> 03:40:25.017]  So he's going before the Supreme Court.
[03:40:25.017 --> 03:40:25.979]  They answered with a...
[03:40:28.095 --> 03:40:31.257]  Memorandum of law, but no affidavit of fact.
[03:40:31.257 --> 03:40:34.319]  They have no fact to go before the court.
[03:40:34.319 --> 03:40:35.459]  They were afraid.
[03:40:35.459 --> 03:40:42.764]  They didn't produce a lot of garbage because they were clearly afraid that if they lied to this court, this court would come back and get them.
[03:40:43.684 --> 03:40:45.926]  And he may beat them hands down.
[03:40:45.926 --> 03:40:48.648]  This was absolutely totally unexpected.
[03:40:48.648 --> 03:40:51.190]  The point is they've been getting away with murder forever.
[03:40:51.190 --> 03:40:55.153]  We just gotta stand up and even if we don't win every time, we're pointing out the fraud.
[03:40:55.153 --> 03:40:56.234]  Let's go to another call here.
[03:40:56.234 --> 03:40:57.454]  Let's talk to Steve in Pennsylvania.
[03:40:57.454 --> 03:40:58.355]  We gotta hurry now.
[03:40:58.355 --> 03:41:00.857]  Steve, thanks for holding her on the air with Randy Kelton.
[03:41:00.857 --> 03:41:01.698]  Hey, hi.
[03:41:01.698 --> 03:41:03.239]  What's going on over there?
[03:41:03.239 --> 03:41:04.520]  Good, welcome.
[03:41:04.520 --> 03:41:11.965]  Hey, I have a question here for Randy and I'd really appreciate it if he'd give me an honest answer here.
[03:41:11.965 --> 03:41:12.846]  I have a sister
[03:41:13.621 --> 03:41:28.646]  That lives up in New York City and she had a home worth $300,000 and it was paid for and one day they received a note in the mail saying that they were going to foreclose on a property.
[03:41:28.646 --> 03:41:39.309]  Now it came out in court that a private attorney which was forged by somebody else that they refinanced
[03:41:40.197 --> 03:41:42.579]  And took loans out, not once, but twice.
[03:41:42.579 --> 03:41:43.700]  Oh yeah, I read about this.
[03:41:43.700 --> 03:41:44.780]  I get calls and read about this.
[03:41:44.780 --> 03:41:46.262]  This is constant.
[03:41:46.262 --> 03:41:48.443]  About three times, and then they foreclosed.
[03:41:48.443 --> 03:42:00.212]  And when I went to court and everything, the other person involved also was getting Section 8 money for three or four different tenants supposedly living in the property.
[03:42:00.212 --> 03:42:04.635]  And when it came to court, she took the fifth
[03:42:05.345 --> 03:42:11.709]  You know, saying she's not going to testify in court because she doesn't want to incriminate herself.
[03:42:11.709 --> 03:42:14.690]  My sister went to the FBI, went to district attorneys.
[03:42:14.690 --> 03:42:15.731]  So let me ask you, what happened?
[03:42:15.731 --> 03:42:17.532]  They ended up taking the house?
[03:42:17.532 --> 03:42:18.712]  Yeah, she lost the house.
[03:42:18.712 --> 03:42:26.377]  In fact, when they moved, well, when the other people that was living, it was like a duplex, lived in the other house.
[03:42:26.377 --> 03:42:28.298]  I understand, but what's the honest answer you want?
[03:42:28.298 --> 03:42:30.079]  What's the question?
[03:42:30.079 --> 03:42:33.981]  Well, my sister has a handicapped child.
[03:42:34.978 --> 03:42:45.262]  And she lost everything, and in fact they even put her in jail for, on her property, taking pictures as they were moving out the other people living in the house.
[03:42:45.262 --> 03:42:46.062]  Yeah, that's standard.
[03:42:46.062 --> 03:42:48.863]  So what's the question?
[03:42:48.863 --> 03:42:50.223]  Where does she go from here?
[03:42:50.223 --> 03:42:51.764]  I mean, nobody would help her?
[03:42:51.764 --> 03:42:54.025]  The FBI?
[03:42:54.025 --> 03:42:54.945]  How long has this been?
[03:42:56.159 --> 03:42:57.901]  Uh, about a year and a half ago.
[03:42:57.901 --> 03:43:06.492]  Okay, first thing you need to do is your homework and it's hard for me to give you a pat answer because this has been through court.
[03:43:06.492 --> 03:43:12.019]  So I would need to see what has actually been filed in the court.
[03:43:12.019 --> 03:43:15.383]  Primarily what I would want to look at doing is going after the court itself.
[03:43:16.581 --> 03:43:19.403]  The court has two duties as a trial court.
[03:43:19.403 --> 03:43:26.649]  He must determine the facts in accordance with the rules of evidence, and then he must apply the law as it comes to him to the facts in the case.
[03:43:26.649 --> 03:43:29.872]  If he fails to do so, you can go for the judge itself.
[03:43:29.872 --> 03:43:33.355]  If this is as improper as it sounds,
[03:43:34.465 --> 03:43:40.109]  Probably the best place to go initially is after the judge, but it's hard to give you an answer one way.
[03:43:40.109 --> 03:43:54.458]  Yeah, because it's like diagnosing somebody over the telephone, but this is kind of a microcosm of what the derivatives are, where they sell it to all these different banks, and even though you've already paid off one bank, the other comes to get it, because they think they own your house, and now the derivatives have gone down, they're not getting their money.
[03:43:54.458 --> 03:43:55.358]  It's the same thing here.
[03:43:55.358 --> 03:44:02.023]  Some scammer, and I keep reading about these in the news, goes and says they have your house, they get loans on the house, that's very common.
[03:44:02.563 --> 03:44:04.263]  And then they default on those.
[03:44:04.263 --> 03:44:05.784]  And you're like, no, I'm the real person.
[03:44:05.784 --> 03:44:06.304]  I live here.
[03:44:06.304 --> 03:44:07.284]  This is wrong.
[03:44:07.284 --> 03:44:07.944]  They don't care.
[03:44:07.944 --> 03:44:09.225]  The court says doesn't matter.
[03:44:09.225 --> 03:44:11.025]  Boom, we're giving it to the bank.
[03:44:11.025 --> 03:44:17.147]  Yes, they're going to say it goes to the person who has a right to possession.
[03:44:17.147 --> 03:44:21.568]  And if you have a problem with how he got possession, you'll have to deal with that somewhere else.
[03:44:21.568 --> 03:44:22.948]  And that's kind of how they sidestep it.
[03:44:24.039 --> 03:44:27.222]  And we're working on ways to go after the judges themselves.
[03:44:27.222 --> 03:44:28.864]  But it just shows what a mess it is.
[03:44:28.864 --> 03:44:37.712]  I mean, if they're so confident they'll take the death benefits that people paid for in insurance of six million veterans, they'll do anything!
[03:44:37.712 --> 03:44:42.956]  I mean, they made a deal with the Veterans Affairs to allow them to do it.
[03:44:42.956 --> 03:44:45.559]  I mean, because they're making campaign contributions.
[03:44:45.919 --> 03:44:48.781]  And the corrupt government said, go ahead and rob the vets.
[03:44:48.781 --> 03:44:50.283]  I'm sorry to hear about that story, Steve.
[03:44:50.283 --> 03:44:51.724]  I get those calls all the time.
[03:44:51.724 --> 03:44:53.305]  Let's talk to Ben in North Carolina.
[03:44:53.305 --> 03:44:55.167]  Ben, you're on the air.
[03:44:55.167 --> 03:44:56.047]  Hey, Alex.
[03:44:56.047 --> 03:44:57.589]  I'm a regular listener.
[03:44:57.589 --> 03:45:08.818]  My question for Randy is, Randy, how can we hire you to help us fight our foreclosure, or who do you recommend that we could contact to obtain help?
[03:45:08.818 --> 03:45:10.699]  Go to mortgagecrime.com.
[03:45:13.209 --> 03:45:17.453]  And just put in some information there so we can get back to you.
[03:45:17.453 --> 03:45:19.695]  And we will show you how to go after these people.
[03:45:19.695 --> 03:45:22.278]  But to be clear, I mean, again, there's no silver bullet.
[03:45:22.278 --> 03:45:23.819]  Randy can't completely hold your hand.
[03:45:23.819 --> 03:45:25.260]  He can show you cases.
[03:45:25.260 --> 03:45:26.882]  He can look at your numbers, right?
[03:45:26.882 --> 03:45:27.202]  Right.
[03:45:27.202 --> 03:45:29.004]  But I mean, your problem is you're completely overwhelmed.
[03:45:29.204 --> 03:45:33.289]  Yes, we're going to try to teach you how to protect yourself.
[03:45:33.289 --> 03:45:37.414]  We could spoon feed you all the documentation, wouldn't help a bit.
[03:45:37.414 --> 03:45:46.745]  Once you understand what's wrong and get an idea of how you can fight this yourself, you will be a part of the fix to the problem.
[03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:49.661]  We don't have to have the whole country rise up.
[03:45:49.661 --> 03:45:53.223]  But you said of 200 cases, you've only had five in the last year get thrown out.
[03:45:53.223 --> 03:45:55.544]  I mean, it's a bottom line you're able to stall them.
[03:45:55.544 --> 03:45:56.624]  And those cases aren't done.
[03:45:56.624 --> 03:46:01.386]  It's just those are the only people that are out of their property and only because we got them too late.
[03:46:01.386 --> 03:46:02.787]  We're still after them.
[03:46:02.787 --> 03:46:08.790]  We have a lot of cases where we got them after the person had already been out of the house, the house sold.
[03:46:08.790 --> 03:46:10.991]  We go back after them, sue them anyway.
[03:46:10.991 --> 03:46:14.092]  We have people that are up to date on their mortgage.
[03:46:14.092 --> 03:46:15.533]  Those are the ones that are getting the best deals.
[03:46:16.863 --> 03:46:23.584]  One of them filed suit and in seven days got an offer to modify from six and a half percent to two.
[03:46:24.355 --> 03:46:25.856]  Oh, that's a good point.
[03:46:25.856 --> 03:46:30.978]  Don't just go after them criminally or civilly once they're already foreclosing.
[03:46:30.978 --> 03:46:33.479]  There's fraud in the truth in lending.
[03:46:33.479 --> 03:46:34.700]  There's fraud in the fees.
[03:46:34.700 --> 03:46:36.720]  There's fraud in how they sold it.
[03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:38.941]  You can go after them even if you don't have a problem.
[03:46:38.941 --> 03:46:41.563]  This is only secondarily about foreclosure.
[03:46:41.563 --> 03:46:47.525]  Primarily, this is about stinking lying thieves and going after the stinking lying thieves.
[03:46:47.525 --> 03:46:51.507]  So what specifically, real quick there, Ben, what happened with you?
[03:46:51.507 --> 03:46:53.748]  We have a rental property and
[03:46:54.386 --> 03:47:02.068]  We've been trying to do a loan modification over quite a bit of time, and I'm listening to Randy, and I appreciate you guys providing the information.
[03:47:02.068 --> 03:47:05.369]  And they just finally filed a foreclosure notice.
[03:47:05.369 --> 03:47:07.389]  We have some good tenants there.
[03:47:07.389 --> 03:47:09.330]  They've had a rough time because of the economy.
[03:47:09.330 --> 03:47:10.410]  He's a contractor.
[03:47:10.410 --> 03:47:14.131]  He hasn't been making his payment on a regular basis.
[03:47:14.131 --> 03:47:16.331]  My business has dried up a little bit.
[03:47:16.331 --> 03:47:17.491]  We haven't been able to afford it.
[03:47:17.491 --> 03:47:21.432]  So when all this came about, we said, you know what?
[03:47:21.432 --> 03:47:22.593]  We're tired of the bankers.
[03:47:22.593 --> 03:47:23.793]  We're tired of the corruption.
[03:47:24.181 --> 03:47:27.802]  And my wife and I have no problem going pro se to the federal court.
[03:47:27.802 --> 03:47:31.604]  We just need to be trained so we can go fight this fight.
[03:47:31.604 --> 03:47:41.508]  But to be specific, they are, I mean, is it like Randy said, they claim, oh, we'll do a modification and they try to get you in to trick you?
[03:47:41.508 --> 03:47:47.270]  They hadn't tricked us, but you know, every case is different, but I wouldn't put it past them.
[03:47:47.270 --> 03:47:49.191]  I've sort of been playing them because
[03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:58.420]  You know, I've been playing nice guy because I'm aware that all this is corrupt anyway, and the foreclosure process is corrupt, and the criminal bank.
[03:47:58.420 --> 03:48:01.724]  So, it just now has come to a head.
[03:48:01.724 --> 03:48:03.366]  We don't want to lose the property.
[03:48:06.072 --> 03:48:22.821]  I mean, what you would do personally is, because you're not really giving advice, you're talking about what's worked here, is you're saying you would then file suit on, they would have to analyze the fines and fees or the profits they made fraudulently when they did the loan and that's how he'd go after them to make, to then bring them to the table?
[03:48:22.821 --> 03:48:23.342]  Exactly.
[03:48:23.342 --> 03:48:26.243]  You claim fraud against them for everything they did wrong.
[03:48:26.243 --> 03:48:29.005]  They're used to being able to do things wrong and nobody pays attention to it.
[03:48:29.685 --> 03:48:34.347]  So you start bringing them to the table and everything's about the money.
[03:48:34.347 --> 03:48:36.048]  This is a calculation.
[03:48:36.048 --> 03:48:39.810]  Today I just got a call just before I came here from a guy.
[03:48:39.810 --> 03:48:44.212]  Yours is a commercial loan and not a consumer.
[03:48:44.212 --> 03:48:45.433]  His was a commercial.
[03:48:45.433 --> 03:48:46.894]  He filed suit.
[03:48:46.894 --> 03:48:48.455]  The attorney called him.
[03:48:48.455 --> 03:48:48.855]  He said,
[03:48:50.309 --> 03:48:52.090]  That he wanted to do a modification.
[03:48:52.090 --> 03:48:53.851]  The guy said, no modification.
[03:48:53.851 --> 03:48:56.852]  He said, look, I got $20,000 left on this note.
[03:48:56.852 --> 03:48:59.633]  It's going to cost you more than that and attorneys to fight me.
[03:48:59.633 --> 03:49:02.735]  And the attorney actually said, yes, it would.
[03:49:02.735 --> 03:49:05.916]  And then when you get into court with me, I'll sue you for over a million dollars.
[03:49:05.916 --> 03:49:06.736]  Good chance.
[03:49:06.736 --> 03:49:10.698]  When you get in front of a jury, jury's going to give me anything I want.
[03:49:10.698 --> 03:49:13.859]  And the attorney said, yeah, that's possible.
[03:49:13.859 --> 03:49:15.480]  And he talked to his client.
[03:49:15.480 --> 03:49:17.881]  They're coming to the table to make a deal.
[03:49:17.881 --> 03:49:19.162]  It's all about the money.
[03:49:20.219 --> 03:49:24.622]  So it's not whether you're going to win or lose at the end.
[03:49:24.622 --> 03:49:35.428]  It's about bringing them to the table to make... Yeah, they're going to make a deal with you because they've got other gazelles, they're like big lions, that they're going to go gobble up that, you know, you're acting like a grizzly bear.
[03:49:35.428 --> 03:49:38.110]  Are they going to attack a grizzly bear or a gazelle?
[03:49:38.110 --> 03:49:44.293]  So you don't want to be a gazelle, you want to be the grizzly bear that somebody dumped from a helicopter out in the middle of the African savannah.
[03:49:44.293 --> 03:49:45.954]  Believe me, nothing's messing with that.
[03:49:45.954 --> 03:49:46.655]  Exactly.
[03:49:46.655 --> 03:49:48.596]  They're going to be looking for gazelles.
[03:49:49.096 --> 03:49:50.217]  I don't know.
[03:50:12.051 --> 03:50:18.274]  And in this overdrive transmission, Randy's back next Thursday, and we'll really get into nitty gritty and just show you his actual cases.
[03:50:18.274 --> 03:50:25.518]  And again, this isn't advice to you, this is what he's done, this is pro se, and Randy's got all the nomenclature for that if he talks to you.
[03:50:25.518 --> 03:50:40.647]  He's just talking about what's worked, what people have done, and understand it's totally corrupt, so nothing's a silver bullet, but you see the mortgages being frozen, you see this happening nationwide, you see people waking up, and you know laying down isn't gonna be good.
[03:50:41.307 --> 03:50:45.328]  So at least stand up and it's having a big effect because it's coming out.
[03:50:45.328 --> 03:50:46.428]  Let's talk real fast.
[03:50:46.428 --> 03:50:49.269]  Kathy in North Carolina, in South Carolina.
[03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:52.329]  Excuse me, you're on the air, Kathy.
[03:50:52.329 --> 03:50:54.329]  Hi, I'm actually from South Carolina.
[03:50:54.329 --> 03:50:55.070]  Yeah, I got it wrong.
[03:50:55.070 --> 03:50:56.670]  I said South Carolina the second time.
[03:50:56.670 --> 03:50:56.970]  Go ahead.
[03:50:56.970 --> 03:50:58.510]  That's alright.
[03:50:58.510 --> 03:51:02.351]  My question is similar to the previous caller.
[03:51:02.351 --> 03:51:04.031]  We are not behind in our mortgage.
[03:51:04.031 --> 03:51:07.752]  However, we're extremely upside down because within the last couple years,
[03:51:08.877 --> 03:51:13.761]  Our home is now not even close to what our loan is.
[03:51:13.761 --> 03:51:16.583]  So you sue to get a... I mean, this is what I would do.
[03:51:16.583 --> 03:51:17.524]  Again, I'm not giving any advice.
[03:51:17.524 --> 03:51:18.144]  I'm not a lawyer.
[03:51:18.144 --> 03:51:19.505]  I'm not out here doing this like Randy is.
[03:51:19.505 --> 03:51:22.468]  We're just debating and discussing this.
[03:51:22.468 --> 03:51:28.572]  Then you sue them for violations in the Truth in Lending Act to then bring them to the table to truly reduce it.
[03:51:28.572 --> 03:51:29.093]  Go ahead.
[03:51:29.093 --> 03:51:29.293]  Yes.
[03:51:29.293 --> 03:51:30.133]  I mean, is that a good idea?
[03:51:30.133 --> 03:51:31.054]  Yeah.
[03:51:31.054 --> 03:51:35.057]  Put them in a position to where they have to do a monetary calculation.
[03:51:35.057 --> 03:51:35.758]  Once you sue them,
[03:51:37.165 --> 03:51:45.810]  Then, they're going to be in court with you, year and a half to two years, and they know precisely what's happening to the real estate market.
[03:51:45.810 --> 03:51:52.173]  In 2008, it drove off a cliff, and real estate prices are dropping like a... And now commercial's going off a cliff.
[03:51:52.173 --> 03:51:54.274]  And commercial is falling behind.
[03:51:54.274 --> 03:51:57.156]  We will see cascading failures.
[03:51:57.156 --> 03:51:58.076]  It's going to get worse.
[03:51:58.076 --> 03:51:59.157]  It's going to get worse fast.
[03:51:59.157 --> 03:52:00.658]  So what's your specific question, Kathy?
[03:52:00.658 --> 03:52:01.458]  I'm sorry.
[03:52:01.458 --> 03:52:06.441]  Yeah, that's basically what I, you know, do I proceed in court, because my husband feels like
[03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:10.042]  If we do the right thing, then things aren't going to happen to us.
[03:52:10.042 --> 03:52:15.805]  But we're not, like you said, we're up against the psychopaths who are doing this to us.
[03:52:15.805 --> 03:52:17.326]  Well, go with what your gut is.
[03:52:17.326 --> 03:52:20.689]  I mean, I'm upside down in my mortgage and I'm not doing this.
[03:52:20.689 --> 03:52:22.290]  And I've gone and looked at the fees and things.
[03:52:22.290 --> 03:52:23.610]  It's not as bad in some cases.
[03:52:23.610 --> 03:52:25.472]  And I like where I live.
[03:52:25.472 --> 03:52:31.956]  But I mean, the point is, if it ever comes down to the total economy melting down or they try some weird chicanery, I'll, I mean, I'll sue them.
[03:52:32.998 --> 03:52:35.360]  Yeah, and it's not that hard.
[03:52:35.360 --> 03:52:38.362]  People aren't accustomed to suits.
[03:52:38.362 --> 03:52:43.826]  We have people that we help get suits filed in court, and they're amazed at how easy it is.
[03:52:43.826 --> 03:52:53.152]  It's not near as daunting as it appears, and you're a pro se, so it doesn't cost you- And by the way, this isn't just us here saying there's a bunch of fraud.
[03:52:53.152 --> 03:52:54.193]  It's admitted.
[03:52:54.193 --> 03:52:57.395]  So all we're doing is citizens going, how do we help people?
[03:52:57.395 --> 03:52:58.376]  How do we help ourselves?
[03:52:58.376 --> 03:52:59.677]  What do we do about these crooks?
[03:53:00.595 --> 03:53:03.698]  Yeah, and you get them into court, the whole dynamic changes.
[03:53:03.698 --> 03:53:05.780]  They have to make a monetary consideration.
[03:53:05.780 --> 03:53:11.747]  Because normally they just lie to you, install you, and pat you on the head, and then just, I mean, at least you're putting up a fight.
[03:53:12.386 --> 03:53:16.249]  If they start lying to you in court, now you've got somebody else looking over their shoulder.
[03:53:16.249 --> 03:53:20.192]  But they notice your husband's saying, do the right thing.
[03:53:20.192 --> 03:53:21.073]  And I understand that.
[03:53:21.073 --> 03:53:22.594]  You know, pay back a debt.
[03:53:22.594 --> 03:53:25.156]  But these banks just made all this up.
[03:53:25.156 --> 03:53:26.737]  They induced the bubble.
[03:53:26.737 --> 03:53:30.921]  And sure, people are dumb, like myself, to be upside down or whatever.
[03:53:30.921 --> 03:53:33.363]  But the point is, we didn't engineer this fraud.
[03:53:33.363 --> 03:53:36.205]  You know, we're not out there taking houses that are paid for.
[03:53:36.465 --> 03:53:38.966]  We're not out there taking houses when we don't have a note.
[03:53:38.966 --> 03:53:41.107]  And besides, it's not about you.
[03:53:41.107 --> 03:53:42.928]  It's not about your husband.
[03:53:42.928 --> 03:53:44.369]  It's about your children.
[03:53:44.369 --> 03:53:44.989]  My children.
[03:53:44.989 --> 03:53:45.789]  My grandchildren.
[03:53:45.789 --> 03:53:46.230]  Exactly.
[03:53:46.230 --> 03:53:47.270]  Randy, we are out of time.
[03:53:47.270 --> 03:53:48.010]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:53:48.010 --> 03:53:51.292]  We'll be back next Thursday from 1 to 3, maybe even longer.
[03:53:51.292 --> 03:53:51.812]  God bless you.
[03:53:51.812 --> 03:53:53.493]  Appreciate you coming in.
[03:53:53.493 --> 03:53:55.514]  And again, that website one more time.
[03:53:55.514 --> 03:53:58.095]  It's mortgagecrime.com.
[03:53:58.095 --> 03:54:00.877]  Mortgagecrime.com as we explore this as citizens.
[03:54:00.877 --> 03:54:01.537]  God bless you all.
[03:54:12.403 --> 03:54:16.186]  You gotta love, uh, you gotta love computer systems sometimes.
[03:54:16.186 --> 03:54:18.887]  We're gonna play as much of this trailer people have been asking us to play.
[03:54:18.887 --> 03:54:22.290]  There have been two more H1N1 related deaths in Rhode Island.
[03:54:22.290 --> 03:54:24.751]  36 children have died from the virus.
[03:54:24.751 --> 03:54:27.673]  76 children have died from the H1N1 virus since April.
[03:54:27.673 --> 03:54:31.376]  The government now believes roughly 8 million children have come down with the virus.
[03:54:31.516 --> 03:54:32.996]  The infection is spreading.
[03:54:32.996 --> 03:54:37.698]  We're stockpiling vaccines, closing schools, and letting government employees work from home.
[03:54:37.698 --> 03:54:39.438]  Prepare, don't panic.
[03:54:39.438 --> 03:54:42.900]  They say the best way to prepare is to have your family vaccinated.
[03:54:42.900 --> 03:54:44.440]  The vaccine appears to be safe.
[03:54:44.440 --> 03:54:49.222]  The Obama administration is considering implementing a new fall vaccination program against the flu.
[03:54:49.222 --> 03:54:55.544]  Composed of mercury, and it's been proven to cause not only Guillain-Barre syndrome, but also autism.
[03:54:55.544 --> 03:54:59.325]  Where schools across the United States, from Kentucky to New York,
[03:55:00.585 --> 03:55:07.890]  ...are forcibly inoculating children with the H1N1 flu vaccine, even when their parents have instructed them not to do so.
[03:55:07.890 --> 03:55:11.872]  And again, when the schools get caught, they say, oops, we made a mistake.
[03:55:11.872 --> 03:55:18.496]  President Obama has now declared the H1N1 virus to be a national emergency.
[03:55:18.496 --> 03:55:21.458]  The White House says the President signed this proclamation last night.
[03:55:21.458 --> 03:55:25.621]  It will allow medical officials to bypass certain federal requirements.
[03:55:26.061 --> 03:55:36.273]  And so because there is this big backlash, they're hyping the H1N1 really as an excuse to try to set the precedent to forcibly inoculate the population.
[03:55:36.273 --> 03:55:38.736]  I was working for one of the local hospitals.
[03:55:38.736 --> 03:55:42.761]  The security officer and my supervisor notified me that there was a training opportunity.
[03:55:43.482 --> 03:55:46.003]  A team was being formed with Homeland Security.
[03:55:46.003 --> 03:56:02.428]  Primarily our job as law enforcement would be to remove the people from their homes, school buses would be brought into the neighborhoods, we would go door to door in teams, and we would evacuate the people from their homes and take them to a decontamination area.
[03:56:02.428 --> 03:56:04.989]  And then sending them to secure facilities.
[03:56:04.989 --> 03:56:10.831]  I mean, that whole description is exactly what they did to the Jews during the Holocaust.
[03:56:11.651 --> 03:56:20.233]  If you've been diagnosed with probable or presumed 2009 H1N1 or swine flu in recent months, you may be surprised to know this.
[03:56:20.233 --> 03:56:23.074]  The odds are you didn't have H1N1 flu.
[03:56:23.074 --> 03:56:26.235]  In fact, you probably didn't have flu at all.
[03:56:26.235 --> 03:56:30.236]  We were told that takedown tactics would be necessary.
[03:56:30.236 --> 03:56:32.276]  Some of these people will not go willingly.
[03:56:32.276 --> 03:56:33.556]  We must take them down.
[03:56:33.556 --> 03:56:36.357]  And they warned us about that, that there's going to be homeowners that may
[03:56:36.357 --> 03:56:36.898]  Police Department!
[03:56:36.898 --> 03:56:37.979]  Well, I don't want you in here.
[03:56:37.979 --> 03:56:38.059]  Well?
[03:56:59.452 --> 03:57:07.076]  The flu virus, or any type of biological threat, is the perfect cover for martial law and control.
[03:57:07.076 --> 03:57:09.917]  Because it's something that makes everyone a potential threat.
[03:57:09.917 --> 03:57:12.498]  It makes everyone a potential carrier.
[03:57:12.498 --> 03:57:13.459]  Everyone a potential
[03:57:13.999 --> 03:57:19.541]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[03:57:43.467 --> 03:57:46.830]  Evacuees are flooding this embarkation center.
[03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:51.733]  Now despite the large number of people and pets, things are running very smoothly.
[03:57:51.733 --> 03:57:57.998]  Now this efficiency can be attributed to a technology solution brought on by Radiant RFID.
[03:57:57.998 --> 03:58:04.803]  The jurisdiction is able to get an accurate manifest on every single person getting on the bus just by walking them through this simple portal.
[03:58:05.185 --> 03:58:08.948]  Well, the Lucid Technology Building is located in western Oklahoma City.
[03:58:08.948 --> 03:58:11.189]  It's a huge, huge building.
[03:58:11.189 --> 03:58:12.910]  Lots of open warehouse space.
[03:58:12.910 --> 03:58:18.534]  Almost completely surrounded by barbed wire fence with secured gates and guard shacks inside of it.
[03:58:18.534 --> 03:58:25.599]  And in the back, there's rail access, which meets the criteria of what people call a FEMA concentration camp.
[03:58:25.599 --> 03:58:28.841]  I mean, there's no sign out front that says FEMA concentration camp.
[03:58:29.241 --> 03:58:35.869]  But it's one of these stills where, you know, it's a spray area, but, you know, immediately when they wanted to utilize it, it could be put into effect.
