[00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:10.488]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:12.089]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:13.010]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.832]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:21.894]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.404 --> 00:00:29.044]  What do you think of this?
[00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:36.830]  The parents of four Montgomery County children under arrest for failing to register their homeschooled children with the school district seven years ago.
[00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.911]  How is this allowed to happen?
[00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:39.132]  Who should be held accountable?
[00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:43.135]  FactFinder Marcia Natal went and got some answers.
[00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:46.497]  Is it fair to say that these four children fell through the cracks?
[00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:52.142]  Well, from what I can gather, it sounds like there was education going on, so I don't know if they really slipped through the cracks.
[00:00:52.142 --> 00:00:57.125]  They didn't fulfill their legal responsibilities to file with the school district to be homeschooled.
[00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.026]  Dr. Richard Hawkins,
[00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.567]  How did you not know that these four kids were not being educated or schooled?
[00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:26.936]  Well, school districts, as a rule, do not have detectives out to see who is and who isn't.
[00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:32.958]  We count on parents to follow the law, which is that all students between the ages of 6 and 16 need to be educated.
[00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.538]  That's enough of this.
[00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:38.139]  We're going to play more of the newscast and break it down later.
[00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.620]  You know, in Germany, they arrest you for homeschooling.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.964]  Two years ago, the state of California declared in court, it later got overturned, that the state owns your children.
[00:01:46.964 --> 00:01:52.869]  It actually said it in the ruling, and that homeschooling was not allowed.
[00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.132]  The state believes it owns your children.
[00:01:57.132 --> 00:01:59.434]  The state believes it owns your children.
[00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:04.118]  In the land of the free, in the home of the brave, I want that to
[00:02:05.547 --> 00:02:16.380]  Sink in to everyone that from Illinois to California, from Connecticut to Florida, they are persecuting homeschoolers.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.268]  I've seen countless news reports where CPS gets called on families, even well to do families,
[00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:42.323]  They persecute the poor even more because neighbors will see their children out playing in the backyard or front yard during the recess time as homeschoolers and the dumbed-down public believes it's illegal and calls the police and the CPS comes.
[00:02:42.323 --> 00:02:43.624]  It's all color of law.
[00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:45.304]  It's all fraud.
[00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:47.806]  I've pulled up the code in New York.
[00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:52.808]  It's one of the more strict, unconstitutional states on homeschooling, but still
[00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.152]  It is a civil matter.
[00:02:57.152 --> 00:02:59.313]  And they never attempted to contact the parents.
[00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:02.795]  They made an example out of them and came and arrested them.
[00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:07.437]  And they have the police on there talking about what evil criminals they are.
[00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:16.221]  You move into a town, you don't register your children for homeschooling, and the police come.
[00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:22.404]  How do they arrest you for not giving your children inoculations when there's no law to take inoculations in any state?
[00:03:22.404 --> 00:03:23.725]  New Jersey's trying to pass a law.
[00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:29.940]  They use contract fraud, they use color of law, they use racketeering.
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:40.344]  The school kicks you out for not taking the shots under policy, never telling you there's a waiver by law, and then triggers truancy laws, and that's how they arrest you.
[00:03:40.344 --> 00:03:43.266]  Then the media, nationwide, engages in a hoax.
[00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.226]  So does Canada and England.
[00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:45.627]  They have the same system of fraud.
[00:03:45.627 --> 00:03:47.888]  It's all globally standardized.
[00:03:47.888 --> 00:03:52.850]  And they tell you it's the law that you've got to have the shots, but then arrest you for the truancy.
[00:03:53.717 --> 00:04:02.622]  And the average parent is so unknowledgeable, so jellyfish-like, that they end up going to jail.
[00:04:02.622 --> 00:04:12.048]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I saw this news report last night, I became beside myself in anger and rage.
[00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:13.869]  I am sick with disgust.
[00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:38.366]  And my mind raced last night and this morning with all the different facets and angles of this and how it ties into the naked body scanners and how the body scanners going in nationwide that the UK government admits violates child porn laws are a total act of submission, an act of domination in the religion of tyranny.
[00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:40.267]  The government is a cult.
[00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:44.446]  It wants to force you to be part of its cult.
[00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:47.129]  And I'm going to break this down and explain it today.
[00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.692]  Then Alan Watts joining us for two hours.
[00:04:49.692 --> 00:04:59.342]  We're going to have completely open phones in the second hour today on all the news I'm about to cover.
[00:04:59.342 --> 00:05:00.203]  We shall return.
[00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:06.121]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:09.362]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:14.164]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:14.164 --> 00:05:20.567]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:22.808]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:23.648]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:24.149]  Bernanke?
[00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.829]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:26.110]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.351]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:49.502]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:06:02.521 --> 00:06:06.544]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:09.786]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:14.588]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:18.431]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.953]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:26.156]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:29.419]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:36.263]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:38.625]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.206]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:40.206 --> 00:06:42.428]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:47.032]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:49.934]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.934 --> 00:06:59.041]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:05.920]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.181]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:16.985]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:17.765]  We're good to go.
[00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.832]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.893 --> 00:08:14.115]  It is Wednesday, the 6th day of January 2010.
[00:08:14.115 --> 00:08:20.317]  We're going to be live here for the next 3 hours and 52 minutes.
[00:08:20.317 --> 00:08:30.922]  Alan Watt of Cutting Through the Matrix to break down the conditioning mind control grid will be joining us in the 3rd and 4th hour today.
[00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:35.023]  We will also have open phones with our guest.
[00:08:35.023 --> 00:08:37.024]  I will have open phones in the next hour.
[00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:38.705]  I have developed some ideas
[00:08:39.705 --> 00:08:47.791]  For the boycott of the government of the airlines with their naked body scanners and what this is really all about.
[00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:58.158]  How it is meant to condition us and sell us to be humiliated, to be a broken nation, to fully submit to their tyranny.
[00:08:59.377 --> 00:09:21.962]  Of course you know about all the countless confirmed reports of TSA groping good-looking women, strip-searching people in public, beating people up, killing people, letting babies that are being flown in inside the United States, inter-country, not from outside the country, for emergency heart surgery, dying as the family begs for hour after hour.
[00:09:23.018 --> 00:09:25.780]  Just a hellish system is being set up.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:35.327]  The economy is being converted to a complete police state grid, where the only jobs you'll be able to get out of college or high school are running the grid.
[00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:38.750]  More than half the public is now working for the government or on welfare.
[00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:47.356]  The criminal government is now sharpening this mass of people into a weapon to rob those of us that are not dependent parasites.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.981]  This is social engineering.
[00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:54.722]  This is the scientific dictatorship.
[00:09:54.722 --> 00:10:05.206]  Now, there's many different facets to the war on individuality, the war on the family, war on self-sufficiency and independence.
[00:10:14.144 --> 00:10:18.965]  And there is a massive war being waged against homeschooling in this country.
[00:10:18.965 --> 00:10:43.311]  Countless dramas and TV shows and cop shows and newspaper reports, in fiction and non-fiction, cast homeschoolers as abusing, racist, dumbed-down scum, when all the statistics, all the numbers, the government's own numbers they like to hide, show that the smartest, most intelligent
[00:10:44.298 --> 00:10:51.260]  Highest test scoring people in America are homeschoolers.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:58.422]  They win more than 90% of national and international spelling bees.
[00:10:58.422 --> 00:11:01.703]  They win the vast majority of geography bees.
[00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:10.105]  They win the vast majority of science, open public science fair, county fair, city fair, science fair competitions.
[00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:20.796]  They are coveted by corporations.
[00:11:20.796 --> 00:11:33.386]  I have homeschoolers in my family, cousins and people, who out of college are snatched up and put in executive grooming positions with Fortune 10 companies.
[00:11:37.287 --> 00:11:51.526]  My father was sent by a corporation he was consulting for to the Four Seasons in Austin to hear a top consultant, two consultants, and he openly three years ago, my dad called me from the
[00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:53.886]  We're good to go.
[00:12:22.245 --> 00:12:32.580]  on their team once they're out of college.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.003]  And the evidence goes on and on and on.
[00:12:35.003 --> 00:12:37.426]  In fact, let's get Charlotte Isserby on next week about this.
[00:12:38.649 --> 00:12:43.672]  Charlotte Isserby, number two, Department of Education, head of policy.
[00:12:43.672 --> 00:12:49.875]  Number two in the entire Department of Education, 1981 to 1985, under Ronald Reagan.
[00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:55.458]  Her father, skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, powerful, blue blood, East Coast family.
[00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:56.659]  She decided to blow the whistle.
[00:12:58.592 --> 00:12:59.854]  This was when Reagan was in.
[00:12:59.854 --> 00:13:03.942]  And of course, Reagan was just reading off cue cards and no idea what was going on.
[00:13:03.942 --> 00:13:11.215]  She was in meetings and she published these secret documents where they openly said, we're going to destroy the language where children can't even talk.
[00:13:12.332 --> 00:13:15.735]  We're going to break down the family entirely.
[00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:18.357]  We are going to program everyone.
[00:13:18.357 --> 00:13:24.482]  We're going to have all curriculum done in the next two decades on computers, so the government has it in databases.
[00:13:24.482 --> 00:13:28.025]  We are going to destroy the family for the New World Order.
[00:13:28.025 --> 00:13:31.487]  And she published the book, Deliberate Dumbing Down, the size of a phone book.
[00:13:31.487 --> 00:13:33.289]  We sell it at Infowars.com.
[00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:45.506]  And more than half of the giant textbook she wrote is government documents, scans of them.
[00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:50.050]  I challenge you to read it and to not throw up.
[00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.412]  I physically got nauseous last night.
[00:13:53.412 --> 00:13:59.497]  I physically had to control myself to not pound holes in the walls at the office this morning.
[00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:11.143]  Because at an instinctive, primitive, natural, healthy level, I know what slavery is, and that's what we're going into.
[00:14:11.143 --> 00:14:14.904]  Real, hardcore slavery.
[00:14:14.904 --> 00:14:23.306]  Social engineering, run by Madison Avenue, run by the think tanks, run by the psychiatrists and psychologists, they know what they're doing.
[00:14:25.103 --> 00:14:28.105]  The outlandishness of the news now.
[00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:40.134]  Every time I watch it, it's, put your hat and mittens on, it's going to be cold in Austin like we're children, and the state and media is our mommy and daddy, our big daddy.
[00:14:40.134 --> 00:14:43.656]  They talk to us like children.
[00:14:43.656 --> 00:14:48.299]  Government study shows mercury is actually good for your brain.
[00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:53.623]  Oh, lead and poison in toys is good for our economy, MSNBC.
[00:14:53.623 --> 00:14:54.484]  I've played these clips.
[00:14:57.202 --> 00:14:58.323]  Newscast!
[00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:00.204]  How could this be allowed to happen?
[00:15:00.204 --> 00:15:03.007]  Let's find out how this happened.
[00:15:03.007 --> 00:15:06.750]  How these children for seven years were homeschooled and no one knew.
[00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:16.057]  Um... It's like being in kindergarten again when the person tattles.
[00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:19.440]  Um... I thought for a minute they were going to say,
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:27.647]  How on earth did this family SWAT team get arrested at their house, their children grabbed, CPS involved?
[00:15:27.647 --> 00:15:34.674]  Because at the start of the newscast he says, how did this happen?
[00:15:34.674 --> 00:15:35.815]  We're going to find out!
[00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:39.582]  And then they are all freaked out.
[00:15:39.582 --> 00:15:40.962]  It's scary.
[00:15:40.962 --> 00:15:48.084]  I don't know how for seven years in a rural area, hard-working family, and then they go on to admit, well, they were actually educated.
[00:15:48.084 --> 00:15:49.424]  But see, the state is there.
[00:15:49.424 --> 00:15:51.565]  The cult is there.
[00:15:51.565 --> 00:15:53.745]  You've got to be part of the cult.
[00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:57.366]  You've got to register with the government.
[00:15:57.366 --> 00:15:59.887]  You've got to file forms in New York.
[00:15:59.887 --> 00:16:01.327]  Now, it's a civil matter.
[00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:07.671]  And then if you don't comply, it can become a truancy matter.
[00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:08.892]  But they didn't send them a letter.
[00:16:08.892 --> 00:16:10.134]  They didn't send them a notice.
[00:16:10.134 --> 00:16:14.517]  They made an example of them.
[00:16:14.517 --> 00:16:16.859]  I have seen more than a hundred reports.
[00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:17.540]  Guaranteed.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.422]  I see them every couple weeks for the last six, seven years.
[00:16:20.422 --> 00:16:32.493]  The federal government passes not a law, but a regulation if states want their Farm Bureau money, their agriculture money,
[00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:43.232]  And the government's come in and taken over all the local activist groups and turned them into government bodies and non-governmental organizations.
[00:16:43.232 --> 00:16:47.794]  If the states want their money, they've got to put in animal ID, premises ID, and I've read it.
[00:16:47.794 --> 00:16:51.276]  For our ranch and farm, we got one, we refused to sign it.
[00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:54.438]  And it said, you waive your rights.
[00:16:54.438 --> 00:16:58.360]  You are now a steward of the land, the government controls it, that's what the legalese says.
[00:17:00.526 --> 00:17:07.111]  And there's $1,000 a day or higher fines if a cow or a chicken dies and you don't tell us.
[00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:14.497]  Or if it doesn't have an RFID bracelet on it costing more than the chicken or what you can sell it for.
[00:17:14.497 --> 00:17:17.939]  And they'll be federal and local state inspections.
[00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:20.021]  Premises ID, animal ID.
[00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:24.644]  Now, there's no law, but then they use color of law regulations.
[00:17:24.644 --> 00:17:27.867]  And they did this as a spot test all over the country
[00:17:28.786 --> 00:17:44.150]  They will check and see if the person, part of the 4-H club or the Ag club, at the county fair or city fair, they will check and they will see who didn't sign the animal ID, premises ID.
[00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.250]  Because you have to have that to then be part of the 4-H club now.
[00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.631]  It has nothing to do with your home or your farm or your ranch.
[00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:52.132]  They just say, oh, it's a policy.
[00:17:52.132 --> 00:17:53.992]  Just like it's a policy, you've got to take inoculations.
[00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:19.484]  And then they fraudulently rig it with the judges, this is on record, to where they give the award to someone that hasn't, they give the first place blue ribbon, it's a stunt, for the hog, or for the cow, or for the sheep, or for the goat, or for the goose, or for the chicken, they give it
[00:18:21.147 --> 00:18:26.323]  In one of the categories to someone and then they put them in handcuffs on the stage.
[00:18:26.323 --> 00:18:27.206]  They bring them to the stage.
[00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.430]  This has been in the news hundreds of times.
[00:18:29.522 --> 00:18:32.063]  And they say, oh, we're sorry, you can't win now.
[00:18:32.063 --> 00:18:36.245]  And they either put them in handcuffs and say, you violated a law, but then let them go, there's no law.
[00:18:36.245 --> 00:18:41.687]  Or they make them cry and escort them out with police security, off the grounds, crying.
[00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:42.907]  And everyone says, what happened?
[00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:43.728]  What happened?
[00:18:43.728 --> 00:18:46.129]  They didn't do the Animal ID, Premise Society.
[00:18:46.129 --> 00:18:52.772]  This is the psych warfare operations in America.
[00:18:52.772 --> 00:18:58.474]  So that you will sign on to the Animal ID, Premise Society and waive your rights that big agriculture has waivers from.
[00:18:59.909 --> 00:19:09.833]  Tyson Chicken gets one RFID for over 10,000 chickens, depending on the type of ID they get.
[00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:15.755]  You have to get one $10 to $14 tag per chicken.
[00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:19.537]  And the only state to actually pass a law with the feds was Texas.
[00:19:21.408 --> 00:19:23.169]  And it goes on and on.
[00:19:23.169 --> 00:19:25.371]  Remember the Associated Press out of Michigan?
[00:19:25.371 --> 00:19:27.892]  And then it came out in California and then Texas?
[00:19:27.892 --> 00:19:36.238]  Where they do unannounced police drills, running into elementary schools, screaming, we're homeschoolers against public education, we're going to kill you.
[00:19:36.238 --> 00:19:41.721]  They take them out in the parking lot and set a bus on fire as the children urinate on themselves.
[00:19:41.721 --> 00:19:44.023]  This is hardcore Soviet re-education.
[00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:53.256]  That is in the news, and the locals say, well, we were paid in the grant to go off this script, to demonize homeschooling and the Second Amendment.
[00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:57.699]  We have a completely criminal psych warfare government.
[00:19:57.699 --> 00:19:59.501]  You are under PSYOP attack!
[00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:03.840]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.262]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[00:20:06.262 --> 00:20:09.805]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[00:20:09.805 --> 00:20:14.589]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:19.753]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:24.838]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[00:20:24.838 --> 00:20:31.284]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[00:20:31.284 --> 00:20:32.926]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[00:20:32.926 --> 00:20:39.412]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[00:20:39.412 --> 00:20:41.054]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[00:20:41.294 --> 00:20:41.714]  I think so.
[00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:03.371]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:04.232]  Spy on me?
[00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:04.552]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.552 --> 00:21:09.597]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.597 --> 00:21:11.219]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:11.219 --> 00:21:11.979]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:12.380]  Yeah.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.481]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.443]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:20.327]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:23.190]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.071]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:27.652]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.652 --> 00:21:27.952]  Right!
[00:21:27.952 --> 00:21:31.274]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:31.274 --> 00:21:31.855]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:33.195]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:33.195 --> 00:21:37.057]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:37.057 --> 00:21:40.839]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:45.982]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:45.982 --> 00:21:48.904]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:21:49.384 --> 00:21:51.129]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:21:51.129 --> 00:21:55.442]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:21:55.442 --> 00:21:57.026]  That's StartPage.com
[00:22:01.098 --> 00:22:11.127]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:11.127 --> 00:22:17.573]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:17.573 --> 00:22:26.421]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:35.966]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:35.966 --> 00:22:40.569]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:40.569 --> 00:22:42.370]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.871]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:46.192]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.192 --> 00:22:52.655]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:56.237]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.237 --> 00:22:59.598]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.598 --> 00:23:01.599]  Hello.
[00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:06.362]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:23:06.362 --> 00:23:10.764]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:20.895]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:23:20.895 --> 00:23:25.119]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:29.482]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:23:29.482 --> 00:23:34.046]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:23:34.046 --> 00:23:35.948]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:23:36.288 --> 00:23:38.269]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:40.169]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:45.891]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:49.312]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:23:49.312 --> 00:23:52.894]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:23:52.894 --> 00:23:56.895]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:13.061]  You can go on for a long time, you social engineering criminals, you parasites.
[00:24:13.061 --> 00:24:15.524]  Run on for a long time.
[00:24:15.524 --> 00:24:17.366]  I was sent a color scan.
[00:24:29.588 --> 00:24:33.371]  of the Boston Herald that clearly has U.S.
[00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:36.933]  Army searching house to house for a bank robber.
[00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:38.835]  Remember my film Road to Tyranny, 2002?
[00:24:38.835 --> 00:24:58.549]  We interviewed a retired Marine Corps captain, owns a computer company now in Austin, who ran into a warrantless Army checkpoint in Kyle, south of Austin, got mad about it, and showed me photos, documents, all of it, now it's declassified since then, of how in the late 1980s, regular Marines were secretly raiding
[00:24:59.309 --> 00:25:02.150]  Gun owners' homes in Virginia.
[00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:09.272]  This has been a long-term secret criminal program, totally illegal, and now they're just doing it out in the open.
[00:25:09.272 --> 00:25:11.253]  We are being hit from every side.
[00:25:11.253 --> 00:25:14.634]  This government is so stinking and so wicked.
[00:25:14.634 --> 00:25:20.955]  It's robbed 28-plus trill since the banker takeover of October 2008 in the last year and a month.
[00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:24.497]  Year in three months.
[00:25:24.497 --> 00:25:26.057]  Man, how time flies.
[00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:28.698]  We're being raped by government on every side.
[00:25:28.698 --> 00:25:31.279]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:43.903]  Look at what the king did, creating swarms of new agencies and sending forth swarms of agents to eat out our substance, like locusts coming down on a wheat field and clearing it in minutes.
[00:25:46.249 --> 00:25:53.391]  I saw some statistics last night about TxDOT here in Texas and how they're still going ahead with the North American Union Trans-Texas Corridors.
[00:25:55.199 --> 00:26:01.804]  They told the idiot public ten years ago they were going to build this I-30 loop around Austin to make the trucks go around it.
[00:26:01.804 --> 00:26:03.265]  Then they made it a toll road.
[00:26:03.265 --> 00:26:04.726]  You drive on it, it's a ghost town.
[00:26:04.726 --> 00:26:08.909]  Nobody can pay the seven to eight dollars, depending on how far you ride on it.
[00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:09.950]  I've ridden it a few times.
[00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.572]  It's literally empty at rush hour.
[00:26:12.572 --> 00:26:14.613]  You might see a car every ten minutes or something.
[00:26:14.613 --> 00:26:17.755]  I mean, it's just off the charts insane.
[00:26:17.755 --> 00:26:21.258]  Capital Metro, the bus system that one percent of Austin's
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.802]  Citizens Ride cost an average of $37.
[00:26:25.802 --> 00:26:29.685]  That's in the Statesman Today.
[00:26:29.685 --> 00:26:31.426]  $37 for a person to ride it.
[00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:35.469]  They pay $2 on average.
[00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:40.853]  They get $150 million a year to run it in Austin.
[00:26:40.853 --> 00:26:44.395]  Guess what the roads in Austin get?
[00:26:44.395 --> 00:26:48.258]  $70 million!
[00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:51.060]  They get double and $10 million extra.
[00:26:55.373 --> 00:26:57.874]  Two times 70 million is 140 mil.
[00:26:57.874 --> 00:27:08.999]  They get $150 million and they're getting ready to raise the sales tax even more in Austin for the stupid buses that nobody rides.
[00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:11.340]  The city isn't designed for buses.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.040]  1% of the city rides them.
[00:27:13.058 --> 00:27:39.973]  And they get $150 million, and I was listening to news stations this morning, flipping through the local news stations, and they were all announcing on the news, good little dutiful servants of the government, simultaneously reading off the scripts the government gives them, the PR scripts they're given, of how great it's going to be that we're going to have extra taxes in Austin for trains that nobody can ride or get to, because the city isn't set up for that.
[00:27:41.912 --> 00:27:59.757]  And how, don't worry, the state, who's getting record gas tax money by the way, and all the federal money, that they are going to tax you by the mile, and you don't even have to have a satellite tracker box in your car, it's going to read your license plate mile to mile and send you a bill.
[00:28:01.064 --> 00:28:04.506]  And if you don't pay the bill, they're going to come and arrest you.
[00:28:04.506 --> 00:28:07.348]  And they have these radio and TV ads going, Roundup!
[00:28:07.348 --> 00:28:07.888]  Roundup!
[00:28:07.888 --> 00:28:08.409]  Roundup!
[00:28:08.409 --> 00:28:09.069]  Texas!
[00:28:09.069 --> 00:28:09.629]  Roundup!
[00:28:09.629 --> 00:28:10.110]  Austin!
[00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.230]  You'll be rounded up!
[00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.732]  So when there's a real roundup, people are used to hearing the word roundup.
[00:28:13.732 --> 00:28:14.252]  Roundup!
[00:28:14.252 --> 00:28:16.834]  Over 10% of Texas has warrants out for their arrest.
[00:28:16.834 --> 00:28:18.895]  It'll be 50 by the time they're done.
[00:28:18.895 --> 00:28:20.276]  And they're going to squeeze and squeeze.
[00:28:20.276 --> 00:28:21.657]  They want you to go bankrupt.
[00:28:21.657 --> 00:28:23.538]  They want you to lose your kids.
[00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:27.641]  When you go bankrupt, CPS is going to come and they're going to take your children.
[00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:30.291]  And then they're going to have one-child policy.
[00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:34.975]  Then they're going to tell you, we'll let you have your kids back, but sterilize your daughters.
[00:28:34.975 --> 00:28:36.196]  That's now being announced in the news.
[00:28:36.196 --> 00:28:37.258]  They're now introducing it.
[00:28:37.258 --> 00:28:42.463]  And hey, we're going to naked body scan you and your family and record their naked bodies in your face.
[00:28:42.463 --> 00:28:48.809]  And hey, we're going to arrest homeschoolers' parents through color of law.
[00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:50.491]  I've looked at the New York law and statute.
[00:28:54.147 --> 00:28:55.648]  It's a civil penalty.
[00:28:55.648 --> 00:29:04.150]  They were supposed to call them, write them, say, oh, you didn't register as a homeschooler, so we know your kids are, see that's how, oh, we gotta know if kids are being educated.
[00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:09.712]  They come and arrest you as a stunt all over the country, all over Europe, the same social engineering.
[00:29:09.712 --> 00:29:20.596]  I'm gonna break it down after the break, and Kurt Nemo's gonna do an article on this today on the key points I make and the points he adds that I need to get out to everybody, because people need to understand the full,
[00:29:21.756 --> 00:29:25.219]  I just saw another article in France.
[00:29:25.219 --> 00:29:31.825]  If you shout at your wife or someone on the street, forget racist terms, you will be arrested.
[00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:35.913]  France to criminalize shouting at your wife or husband.
[00:29:35.913 --> 00:29:37.994]  Everything is being made illegal.
[00:29:37.994 --> 00:29:40.035]  Everything to catch us in a net.
[00:29:40.035 --> 00:29:44.616]  That's how they enslave you, is they make laws for things that aren't criminal.
[00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.317]  This is new slavery.
[00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:48.138]  The new slavery is here.
[00:29:48.138 --> 00:29:49.158]  It's global.
[00:29:49.158 --> 00:29:50.539]  It's engineered.
[00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:51.939]  Revolt!
[00:29:51.939 --> 00:29:53.340]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.881]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.881 --> 00:29:58.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.618 --> 00:30:04.620]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.945]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.945 --> 00:30:12.006]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:12.006 --> 00:30:17.010]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:17.931]  How much do you want?
[00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:19.292]  When do you want it?
[00:30:19.292 --> 00:30:21.193]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:21.193 --> 00:30:22.254]  When will you need it?
[00:30:22.254 --> 00:30:24.455]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:25.796]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.796 --> 00:30:27.337]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:27.337 --> 00:30:32.601]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.601 --> 00:30:36.183]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:36.183 --> 00:30:39.646]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:40.006 --> 00:30:41.227]  How much will you need?
[00:30:41.227 --> 00:30:42.128]  We don't know.
[00:30:42.128 --> 00:30:43.228]  How much do you want?
[00:30:43.228 --> 00:30:44.149]  All you can get.
[00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:45.250]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.312]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:48.312 --> 00:30:50.513]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:50.513 --> 00:30:51.514]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:03.084 --> 00:31:07.114]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:07.114 --> 00:31:10.341]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:10.341 --> 00:31:11.764]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:31:12.463 --> 00:31:15.146]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:15.146 --> 00:31:21.532]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:21.532 --> 00:31:26.596]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.596 --> 00:31:36.726]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:36.826 --> 00:31:39.168]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:39.168 --> 00:31:40.749]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:40.749 --> 00:31:43.210]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.332]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:45.332 --> 00:31:50.495]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:50.495 --> 00:31:59.601]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:02.988]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.988 --> 00:32:08.571]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:32:08.571 --> 00:32:13.593]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:13.593 --> 00:32:19.176]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:32:19.176 --> 00:32:23.859]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:31.504]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:31.504 --> 00:32:32.624]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:32.624 --> 00:32:35.686]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:39.308]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:39.308 --> 00:32:42.510]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.511]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:45.511 --> 00:32:45.772]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:45.772 --> 00:32:46.012]  Remember,
[00:32:54.451 --> 00:32:58.354]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:58.354 --> 00:33:07.240]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.443]  We are being baptized into slavery.
[00:33:11.443 --> 00:33:15.006]  We are being initiated into total tyranny.
[00:33:15.006 --> 00:33:21.190]  A psychiatric slash police state grid where if you're seen yelling at your children, they're taken.
[00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.891]  Not even the law.
[00:33:22.816 --> 00:33:25.501]  Not even real courts set up under the eugenics courts.
[00:33:25.501 --> 00:33:32.073]  What courts do you think issued orders to have people sterilized in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s?
[00:33:32.073 --> 00:33:33.675]  Over half a million women in the U.S.
[00:33:34.858 --> 00:33:45.426]  The eugenics courts, you know them as the family courts, you know them as that system where the judge and the CPS, no jury, to protect the children, there's no jury.
[00:33:45.426 --> 00:33:47.047]  Can't trust the citizens.
[00:33:47.047 --> 00:33:49.749]  They say we decide yelling at your children.
[00:33:49.749 --> 00:33:52.611]  Now, yelling at your wife.
[00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:56.153]  London Telegraph, France to criminalize shouting at your wife.
[00:33:56.153 --> 00:34:03.619]  Married couples could be arrested and charged for insulting each other under new law in France banning psychological violence.
[00:34:05.762 --> 00:34:15.690]  But if police dogs want to bite old ladies coming out of a shopping mall with bags in their hands and hit crowds with sound cannons, that's okay.
[00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.811]  The violence intensifies on television.
[00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:21.434]  The murder, the tyranny, the corruption, the images, the dehumanization.
[00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:32.563]  But then if a child in art class is asked to draw a picture of their parents, they draw a picture of their father who's a police officer with a gun, the child is arrested and put under psychiatric care.
[00:34:32.563 --> 00:34:33.784]  That's in the news every week!
[00:34:35.452 --> 00:34:46.576]  Again, they put out these messages and then when people buy into it... Oh, you can play video games where you're slaughtering and killing and butchering people.
[00:34:46.576 --> 00:34:53.958]  Where you run false flag attacks.
[00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:56.099]  Like the new number one video game on store shelves.
[00:34:57.895 --> 00:35:00.177]  That's all okay.
[00:35:00.177 --> 00:35:05.042]  You can love Jack Bauer on TV when he tortures someone's child to get answers and stops L.A.
[00:35:05.042 --> 00:35:05.682]  from being nuked.
[00:35:05.682 --> 00:35:11.788]  You can love the Army's report where they admit they raped children in front of their parents in camps all over the world.
[00:35:11.788 --> 00:35:13.109]  That's good!
[00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:20.176]  They can body scan your little children and your wife and save their naked images and use the biometric body scan however they want.
[00:35:20.176 --> 00:35:20.837]  That's good!
[00:35:22.011 --> 00:35:24.632]  But don't you raise your voice!
[00:35:24.632 --> 00:35:32.494]  I told you, everything going on in the public schools is what is being rolled out worldwide for adults.
[00:35:32.494 --> 00:35:39.556]  More than 15 years ago, the federal government began, in grants and studies and training, to tell schools to ban.
[00:35:39.556 --> 00:35:47.378]  And the insurance companies that gave them insurance said, ban running, ban dodgeball, ban catch, ban tag, ban you're it.
[00:35:48.226 --> 00:35:49.791]  Ban talking!
[00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:50.834]  Ban hugging!
[00:35:50.834 --> 00:35:52.619]  Ban shaking hands!
[00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:53.783]  Ban everything!
[00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.891]  Put them on Prozac!
[00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:57.211]  Put them on Ritalin!
[00:35:57.211 --> 00:36:00.073]  But you don't want to put your children in the government training camps?
[00:36:00.073 --> 00:36:04.455]  You don't want them to be taught all these bizarre sexual practices at age 7?
[00:36:04.455 --> 00:36:08.658]  You don't want them to be questioned about what's in mommy and daddy's medicine cabinet?
[00:36:08.658 --> 00:36:10.559]  Do mommy and daddy raise their voice?
[00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:15.962]  You don't want them to be shown cartoons that show polar bears and penguins drowning?
[00:36:15.962 --> 00:36:20.465]  And to come home with little mock ticket books writing you tickets?
[00:36:20.465 --> 00:36:22.466]  Mock tickets for the offenses?
[00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:27.972]  Of taking a hot bath or leaving the sink water on while you brush your teeth?
[00:36:27.972 --> 00:36:32.556]  That's in the news every day, the media praising children all over the U.S.
[00:36:32.556 --> 00:36:40.983]  coming home with federally written programs to tattle and they're training to be the spies!
[00:36:40.983 --> 00:36:49.091]  I told you six years ago the feds had taken over the Boy Scouts with the Explorer Scouts for training them for gun confiscation and part of AmeriCorps, SecureCorps,
[00:36:50.748 --> 00:36:52.408]  I told you that eight years ago, actually.
[00:36:52.408 --> 00:36:56.930]  It was first in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.050]  How great it was.
[00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:06.692]  Then the New York Times shows Explorer Scouts training with guns, and it showed photos, scores of colored photos of the dead U.S.
[00:37:06.692 --> 00:37:09.013]  veterans who refused to turn their guns in.
[00:37:09.013 --> 00:37:11.173]  They put it in the newspaper!
[00:37:11.173 --> 00:37:12.154]  It's hellish!
[00:37:12.154 --> 00:37:13.274]  In your face!
[00:37:13.274 --> 00:37:14.354]  They're going for broke.
[00:37:14.354 --> 00:37:16.355]  They're dropping the bomb on us right now.
[00:37:16.355 --> 00:37:17.615]  They're moving in right now.
[00:37:19.025 --> 00:37:19.746]  And then the L.A.
[00:37:19.746 --> 00:37:22.629]  Times reports two weeks ago, oh, the L.A.
[00:37:22.629 --> 00:37:27.454]  Police Department and other departments around the country, they're running with the Pentagon.
[00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:33.561]  Public schools will now be Pentagon centers run by the Army and police.
[00:37:33.561 --> 00:37:35.823]  And we want the troubled youth, yes, the thugs.
[00:37:36.735 --> 00:37:40.056]  That's what the Nazis did, and the Soviets, and the Maoists did.
[00:37:40.056 --> 00:37:43.756]  And it says, oh, the police departments are taking over the Boy Scouts.
[00:37:43.756 --> 00:37:45.237]  They no longer will even run it.
[00:37:45.237 --> 00:37:58.179]  The police departments will openly run these divisions with children training as literal Hitlerjugend.
[00:37:58.179 --> 00:38:00.600]  And so you don't want to put your children in school.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.321]  Folks, if I knew what I knew now, of course I wouldn't have been in public school.
[00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:05.221]  I went to public school.
[00:38:10.618 --> 00:38:17.003]  I went to public school in kindergarten in the first grade, in a bad part of Dallas.
[00:38:17.003 --> 00:38:19.946]  Then, I remember them bringing in the fluoride pills we all had to eat.
[00:38:19.946 --> 00:38:23.449]  I remember getting a huge headache and throwing up every time they did it.
[00:38:23.449 --> 00:38:24.750]  Every month.
[00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.272]  It wasn't placebo, it wasn't psychosomatic.
[00:38:27.272 --> 00:38:28.053]  I thought it was candy.
[00:38:28.053 --> 00:38:28.413]  I wanted it.
[00:38:28.413 --> 00:38:31.455]  I remember getting sick with those red pills.
[00:38:31.455 --> 00:38:34.338]  A dose that they admit is incredibly toxic.
[00:38:34.338 --> 00:38:36.700]  Thousands of times what's in a pitcher of water.
[00:38:39.292 --> 00:39:02.311]  And then I remember my parents putting me in a Christian school until the sixth grade and they put me back in public school and I got off that school bus and I walked into that public school and kids with mustaches in the sixth grade, kids who were 13, 14 years old, who'd flunked four or five times began beating me up and the teachers wouldn't do anything.
[00:39:02.311 --> 00:39:03.352]  And sure, it made me tough.
[00:39:07.165 --> 00:39:17.611]  And I remember the vicious social behavior, and the kids competing for the shoes and clothes they wore, and the vicious social engineering.
[00:39:17.611 --> 00:39:23.795]  And it's a lot worse now, you know that, hundreds of times worse, conservatively.
[00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:31.020]  And I remember I didn't use drugs, and I remember in the 8th grade,
[00:39:32.768 --> 00:39:41.608]  in the football field house over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:52.202]  It turned out this football player's brother in high school had been caught with drugs.
[00:39:52.202 --> 00:39:57.064]  And so they told him, go get us a bunch of people, rat out a bunch of people and we'll let you off.
[00:39:57.064 --> 00:40:04.847]  And they even got his little brother in a separate school to go around and beg everyone to bring him marijuana.
[00:40:04.847 --> 00:40:06.128]  To sell him marijuana.
[00:40:07.352 --> 00:40:17.095]  And then months later, they had a big bust, and it turned out several kids had gone to their big brothers and said, please, my buddy, the cool kid on the football team, it was the cool kid.
[00:40:17.095 --> 00:40:18.456]  See how they know how to prey on everybody?
[00:40:18.456 --> 00:40:29.399]  They got the cool, one of the cool kids on the football team, to go around to all the kids that wanted to be cool, and it took him months to get them to bring him small amounts of marijuana.
[00:40:29.399 --> 00:40:34.461]  That's your stinking degenerate government, while the Pentagon openly runs the opium out of Afghanistan.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:42.686]  Openly ships the cocaine in, in the 1980s, when I was in school.
[00:40:42.686 --> 00:40:45.649]  It's a predator-criminal government.
[00:40:45.649 --> 00:40:53.057]  Most of them know full well what they are doing.
[00:40:53.057 --> 00:40:58.102]  Now, if someone gets caught with an aspirin, they get charged with felonies in schools.
[00:40:59.795 --> 00:41:03.377]  If someone doesn't put their Ritalin in a proper container, they get charged with felonies.
[00:41:03.377 --> 00:41:10.660]  They push the drugs illegal and legal on you, and then when they catch you with them, I see reports every couple days of old ladies pulled over.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:18.023]  And the cops in these predatory towns all over the country, New Jersey, Texas, or some of the ones that pop up the most, Michigan, California.
[00:41:18.703 --> 00:41:23.785]  With these predatory small towns, models, just microcosms of the towns above them.
[00:41:23.785 --> 00:41:26.286]  And the states, and the corruption that runs rampant above them.
[00:41:35.009 --> 00:41:35.969]  You do, sonny.
[00:41:35.969 --> 00:41:48.332]  And old ladies like to put their little pills, their heart medication, and if any of it's prescription, they don't care, they go to jail and they take their car and take their money because you had drugs.
[00:41:48.332 --> 00:41:50.733]  Doesn't matter if you had a prescription at home.
[00:41:50.733 --> 00:41:51.893]  The letter of the law!
[00:41:51.893 --> 00:41:54.134]  We're gonna throw the book at you, you old lady!
[00:41:59.298 --> 00:42:05.021]  They are passing regulations and laws that are completely unconstitutional and preying on everyone.
[00:42:05.021 --> 00:42:20.770]  And all over Austin, and I've seen other cities similar, they have these magazines and newspapers called Busted, and they put all the people's mugshots, and everybody buys them, and it's become a gladiatorial sport and enjoyment to see all the poor people that have been arrested and picked up.
[00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:25.673]  And you read in there, all the families arrested because a neighbor saw them spank their child.
[00:42:28.134 --> 00:42:38.144]  Your kids are in the backyard, your 10-year-old slugs their 4-year-old brother in the face, you come out and you spank him, the neighbor's looking out their window, they call the police.
[00:42:38.144 --> 00:42:46.191]  It's not illegal under the law, but the CPS is above the law, they decide it's abuse, and then that's illegal.
[00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:52.678]  It's all color of law, and then your child that very night, your children are in there in the CPS rape rooms.
[00:42:55.330 --> 00:43:01.997]  I see reports every day without looking of CPS caught running child porn rings and child rape rings.
[00:43:01.997 --> 00:43:06.761]  You see CPS on the news, always big Nelly pedophiles.
[00:43:06.761 --> 00:43:10.204]  Always sicko women that like little girls.
[00:43:10.204 --> 00:43:14.629]  Just running everything, doing whatever they want, getting away with everything.
[00:43:14.629 --> 00:43:17.311]  Raping everyone, enjoying themselves.
[00:43:17.311 --> 00:43:18.713]  A huge hell house.
[00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:29.757]  Of torture and pain and misery just having their way and just spreading like a cancer, like testicizing all over the body.
[00:43:29.757 --> 00:43:35.101]  The country collapsing financially, the GDP shrinking, the joblessness exploding.
[00:43:37.208 --> 00:43:38.189]  Everything a lie!
[00:43:38.189 --> 00:43:41.891]  22% real unemployment of all the real indexes.
[00:43:41.891 --> 00:43:44.053]  The government says 10.2.
[00:43:44.053 --> 00:43:45.394]  Everything's a lie!
[00:43:45.394 --> 00:43:46.714]  The money's a lie!
[00:43:46.714 --> 00:43:48.776]  No silver, no copper in it now.
[00:43:48.776 --> 00:43:52.818]  Just like Mexico 20 years ago took all the real metal out of their money.
[00:43:52.818 --> 00:43:54.580]  We're just like Mexico now.
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.161]  We're just like North Korea.
[00:43:56.161 --> 00:43:57.261]  We're just like Mexico.
[00:43:57.261 --> 00:43:59.303]  It's gonna get worse and worse and worse.
[00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:03.946]  There's no doubt this is a virulent, aggressive, predatory power cult!
[00:44:07.052 --> 00:44:16.818]  All the criminals, all the control freaks, all the pedophiles, all the sickos, all the bullies, all the tyrants, all the power-tripping people.
[00:44:16.818 --> 00:44:17.979]  Who's hiring?
[00:44:17.979 --> 00:44:22.082]  The local government, the state government, the federal, the international.
[00:44:22.082 --> 00:44:30.067]  It's exploding, growing, tripled under Bush, quadrupled in the first year, less than the first year of Obama, the first eight months.
[00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:52.421]  Just growing like cancer in every organ, cancer all over your skin, cancer in your brain, and they're just cramming more tumors in as fast as they can, laughing and smiling and giggling and licking their filthy, degenerate, scum-filled, maggot-head lips.
[00:44:52.421 --> 00:44:53.922]  And it hit me this morning.
[00:44:53.922 --> 00:44:56.563]  It hit me as I was charging down that treadmill jogging.
[00:45:00.191 --> 00:45:02.752]  It hit me that I knew this was a cult.
[00:45:02.752 --> 00:45:08.413]  I knew the government in the New World Order was a cult system, but I didn't consciously get it.
[00:45:08.413 --> 00:45:13.855]  They don't want you outside of their government training centers where your children are trained to be prisoners.
[00:45:13.855 --> 00:45:19.996]  And I want Kurt and Emma, I want you to find those Michigan articles where they did drills, where they didn't tell the kids they were attacked.
[00:45:19.996 --> 00:45:25.958]  They've got them all over the country, where they come in and announce, we're gonna kill you, we're homeschoolers, and blow up a bus in the parking lot and everybody starts crying.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.141]  I interviewed families involved.
[00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:29.222]  I want to add that.
[00:45:29.222 --> 00:45:37.431]  The famous Minnesota case where we interviewed the lady, where they came into the portable buildings, the SWAT team, and said, we're going to kill you.
[00:45:37.431 --> 00:45:39.793]  Went on for an hour.
[00:45:39.793 --> 00:45:46.700]  They're setting the precedent to march in, unannounced, and say, we're going to kill you, just to test their drills, and to get away with that psychological, hardcore abuse.
[00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:56.635]  To take you into body scanners and scan you and save your naked image of you and your children and your family and let everybody know they're doing it and they don't care what you do.
[00:45:56.635 --> 00:46:12.481]  And letting you know, hey, the banks took 28 trillion the last year, they're going to take even more and to have the head of the Treasury and the head of the private Federal Reserve get up before Congress, the House and Senate over and over and over again and say, we're not going to tell you where the money is!
[00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:14.022]  We run this country now!
[00:46:17.076 --> 00:46:23.142]  We're gonna take it and you're gonna like it!
[00:46:23.142 --> 00:46:27.326]  And we're gonna put you in prison if you don't buy healthcare that you can't afford.
[00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:31.289]  And then if you can't afford it, we're gonna say you're destitute and the CPS is gonna come take your kids.
[00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:34.472]  That's what's going on.
[00:46:34.472 --> 00:46:35.013]  It's a cult.
[00:46:36.328 --> 00:46:38.288]  They want you in their public schools.
[00:46:38.288 --> 00:46:39.689]  They want you in their corporate system.
[00:46:39.689 --> 00:46:44.150]  If they can't get you on welfare or get you in the criminal justice system, they've passed a million laws.
[00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:45.750]  There's over a million in this country, you know that?
[00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.230]  All the state laws and the rest of it.
[00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.271]  Over a million.
[00:46:50.271 --> 00:46:54.332]  What is there, four hundred and something thousand federal laws and regulations?
[00:46:54.332 --> 00:46:55.972]  Ignorance of that's no excuse.
[00:46:55.972 --> 00:46:58.153]  They're all color of law and enforceable garbage.
[00:47:03.584 --> 00:47:06.806]  And they come in and they say, you're going to put your children in our schools.
[00:47:06.806 --> 00:47:11.850]  All over the nation, state courts in California and others are ruling, we own your children.
[00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:16.594]  Actually says, the state is the guardian, the state runs the children, we allow parents to raise them.
[00:47:17.728 --> 00:47:31.819]  And they're waging war and demonizing homeschoolers all over TV, all over the media, implying they're pedophiles, implying they're criminals, implying they're abusers, implying they dumb their kids down, when it's the opposite compared to the rest of the government, the state, and the media.
[00:47:31.819 --> 00:47:37.284]  They're the best group out there in every statistic.
[00:47:37.284 --> 00:47:41.247]  And how dare a family move to New York, move to that town,
[00:47:47.148 --> 00:47:58.580]  How dare a family move there, think they're in a free country, think they can raise their children, they put their mugshots all over television, and then the police come and arrest them.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.963]  The school didn't send a letter, they came and arrested them.
[00:48:01.963 --> 00:48:04.706]  How dare you think you are going to raise your children?
[00:48:04.706 --> 00:48:05.707]  How dare you not?
[00:48:06.721 --> 00:48:07.541]  Be our slaves.
[00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:08.042]  That's what this is.
[00:48:08.042 --> 00:48:08.742]  This is slavery.
[00:48:08.742 --> 00:48:15.304]  The federal government in its own documents states that they are going to use the schools to take over the community and the society.
[00:48:15.304 --> 00:48:20.206]  And that's where they train your children how to be prisoners, how to thumb scan to get their food.
[00:48:20.206 --> 00:48:25.448]  Remember 10 years ago people got mad at kids at school lunches having a thumb print, people knew it was Big Brother?
[00:48:25.448 --> 00:48:28.029]  Now it's full body scans.
[00:48:28.029 --> 00:48:32.191]  Now it's warrantless blood sampling on the sides of the highways nationwide.
[00:48:32.191 --> 00:48:34.291]  Now it's troops openly on the streets.
[00:48:34.291 --> 00:48:35.172]  And you know what comes next?
[00:48:35.172 --> 00:48:35.672]  The arrest.
[00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:38.731]  The arrest for your political views.
[00:48:38.731 --> 00:48:46.958]  And every few days I see articles where a neighbor sees an old man, it's almost always in his garage, working on guns at his bench before he goes hunting or shooting.
[00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:48.620]  And the neighbor gets scared and calls the police.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:53.084]  The police go, yeah, he had 11 guns and 2,000 rounds of ammo.
[00:48:53.084 --> 00:48:54.405]  That's nothing.
[00:48:54.405 --> 00:48:55.426]  It's an arsenal.
[00:48:55.426 --> 00:49:02.532]  And then I go look up the state law in Vermont or Massachusetts or Texas or California when I see these newscasts.
[00:49:02.532 --> 00:49:03.332]  And to my horror,
[00:49:04.232 --> 00:49:05.313]  I already knew what I was going to find.
[00:49:05.313 --> 00:49:07.034]  There was no law!
[00:49:07.034 --> 00:49:11.397]  They're arresting people when there's not even a law!
[00:49:11.397 --> 00:49:12.718]  They're predators!
[00:49:12.718 --> 00:49:13.999]  They want your guns!
[00:49:13.999 --> 00:49:15.380]  They're criminal!
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.420]  They're rogue!
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:20.023]  They're outrageously filthy!
[00:49:20.023 --> 00:49:22.244]  CBS News 6.
[00:49:22.244 --> 00:49:25.867]  Parents arrested for failing to register homeschool kids.
[00:49:25.867 --> 00:49:31.671]  A Montgomery County couple has been arrested on child endangerment charges for failing to register their children with the school district.
[00:49:33.123 --> 00:49:49.486]  As they were homeschooled, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said Monday, Richard Cressy, 47, and Margie Cressy, 41, both of the town of Glen, never registered their four children or their homeschooling curriculum with the local school district and the Sheriff's Office.
[00:49:49.486 --> 00:50:00.148]  The superintendent of the Fonda Fulton Central School District confirmed that the four children, ranging in age from 8 to 14, had not been registered with the school district for the last seven years.
[00:50:01.357 --> 00:50:07.019]  The Crassies were issued appearance tickets to appear in the town of Glen Court at a later date.
[00:50:07.019 --> 00:50:12.221]  The case was turned over to the Montgomery County Child District Attorney and Child Protective Services.
[00:50:12.221 --> 00:50:15.942]  So they were arrested and then issued with summons.
[00:50:15.942 --> 00:50:20.203]  Arrested!
[00:50:20.203 --> 00:50:22.404]  And they do this on everything with color of law.
[00:50:22.404 --> 00:50:25.465]  There's no law you gotta take vaccines, they still arrest you.
[00:50:25.465 --> 00:50:30.067]  There's no law you gotta register your kids for homeschooling, it's all color of law, they still arrest you.
[00:50:31.946 --> 00:50:34.067]  And think of all the other instances they do this.
[00:50:34.067 --> 00:50:38.429]  When we come back, I'm going to play this clip and break it down.
[00:50:38.429 --> 00:50:42.131]  Notice how the news report is, oh, how did this happen?
[00:50:42.131 --> 00:50:43.232]  We're going to investigate.
[00:50:43.232 --> 00:50:44.332]  It's so horrible.
[00:50:44.332 --> 00:50:47.974]  There were wild humans living off the government cult.
[00:50:47.974 --> 00:50:50.635]  Not living in the government cult compound.
[00:50:50.635 --> 00:50:57.419]  It's a predatory parasite cult that doesn't want wild humans, like wild cows, living outside the fences.
[00:50:58.908 --> 00:51:02.269]  You, the law-abiding, are the target of the parasites!
[00:51:02.269 --> 00:51:05.031]  They are criminals!
[00:51:05.031 --> 00:51:07.912]  Our economy is in great distress.
[00:51:07.912 --> 00:51:11.453]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[00:51:11.453 --> 00:51:16.975]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[00:51:16.975 --> 00:51:19.637]  You have auto and home insurance.
[00:51:19.637 --> 00:51:22.838]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[00:51:22.838 --> 00:51:27.920]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term because it might take years to recover?
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:35.326]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[00:51:35.326 --> 00:51:42.672]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[00:51:42.672 --> 00:51:50.779]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.

[00:52:04.746 --> 00:52:08.769]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:08.769 --> 00:52:12.011]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:12.011 --> 00:52:13.432]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:14.136 --> 00:52:16.817]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:16.817 --> 00:52:23.198]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:23.198 --> 00:52:28.380]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:38.362]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:38.502 --> 00:52:40.843]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:40.843 --> 00:52:42.424]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:42.424 --> 00:52:44.885]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:44.885 --> 00:52:47.006]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:47.006 --> 00:52:52.148]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:07.951]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:09.732]  Don't ignore your prostate health.

[00:54:03.609 --> 00:54:04.250]  Well, what do you think of this?
[00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:11.737]  The parents of four Montgomery County children under arrest for failing to register their homeschooled children in the school district seven years ago.
[00:54:11.737 --> 00:54:12.278]  Oh my gosh!
[00:54:12.278 --> 00:54:13.099]  How is this allowed to happen?
[00:54:13.099 --> 00:54:14.340]  Who should be held accountable?
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.123]  Fact finder Marcia Tao went and got some answers.
[00:54:17.123 --> 00:54:18.344]  Throw them to the wolves!
[00:54:18.344 --> 00:54:21.247]  Is it fair to say that these four children fell through the cracks?
[00:54:21.667 --> 00:54:27.332]  Well, from what I can gather, it sounds like there was education going on, so I don't know if they really slipped through the cracks.
[00:54:27.332 --> 00:54:31.095]  They didn't fulfill their legal responsibilities to file with the school district.
[00:54:31.095 --> 00:54:32.116]  To the filthy state!
[00:54:32.116 --> 00:54:32.656]  Hit pause!
[00:54:32.656 --> 00:54:35.919]  Dr. Richard Hoffman... That's taken over our society!
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:40.522]  Just 50, 60 years ago it was, oh, we invite your children to come to school.
[00:54:40.522 --> 00:54:41.223]  We invite them.
[00:54:41.223 --> 00:54:43.944]  We built this country without these parasites.
[00:54:43.944 --> 00:54:52.289]  You know the socialists and social engineers and robber barons over 100 years ago publicly said they were going to take over America through public education.
[00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:52.949]  You know that.
[00:54:52.949 --> 00:54:53.890]  You know that's on record.
[00:54:56.809 --> 00:55:12.295]  And now we've gotten to the point of, we're gonna naked body scan you, we're gonna thumbprint you to get school lunches, we're gonna control your life, you're not allowed to pay with cash, we're gonna have you write dossiers and report on your parents, we're gonna train your kids to take on gun owners.
[00:55:12.295 --> 00:55:16.677]  This guy needs to be sued, they all need to be sued.
[00:55:16.677 --> 00:55:18.598]  For unlawful arrest, for abuse, for
[00:55:19.793 --> 00:55:20.915]  This just goes on and on.
[00:55:20.915 --> 00:55:22.437]  These people make me so sick.
[00:55:22.437 --> 00:55:27.525]  And the media, all these idiots that work for the media, they just love the system.
[00:55:27.525 --> 00:55:28.207]  Continue with it.
[00:55:29.704 --> 00:55:45.369]  The superintendent of Fonda Fultonville Schools didn't become aware until mid-December that four children ages 8 to 14 who lived in the town of Glenn for seven years were never registered with the district, but were being homeschooled by their parents, Richard and Margie Cressy.
[00:55:45.369 --> 00:55:51.411]  How did you not know that these four kids were not being educated or schooled?
[00:55:52.331 --> 00:55:58.215]  Well, school districts, as a rule, do not have detectives out to see who is and who isn't.
[00:55:58.215 --> 00:56:04.059]  We count on parents to follow the law, which is that all students... Oh, see, there's the message.
[00:56:04.059 --> 00:56:07.522]  We need to go out and do home inspections, which is now starting.
[00:56:07.522 --> 00:56:09.083]  They fool all these women and men.
[00:56:09.083 --> 00:56:10.724]  Oh, put your kids in Head Start.
[00:56:10.724 --> 00:56:11.845]  It's free education.
[00:56:11.845 --> 00:56:13.366]  Then you get three CPS visits a year.
[00:56:15.731 --> 00:56:20.515]  By the way, all over the state of New York, they're calling for martial law and schenectady in other cities.
[00:56:20.515 --> 00:56:21.676]  Oh, we want army here.
[00:56:21.676 --> 00:56:23.578]  Oh, look, the army's here.
[00:56:23.578 --> 00:56:25.119]  Oh, they'll do door-to-door.
[00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:28.202]  And I have that in the Boston Herald yesterday.
[00:56:28.202 --> 00:56:29.723]  Oh, look, the army's going door-to-door.
[00:56:29.723 --> 00:56:31.525]  How nice of them.
[00:56:31.525 --> 00:56:32.946]  Oh, it's freedom.
[00:56:32.946 --> 00:56:33.466]  Continue.
[00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:37.230]  Between the ages of 6 and 16, you need to be educated.
[00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:40.712]  The Cressy's were arrested on charges of child endangerment.
[00:56:40.712 --> 00:56:45.214]  Police began investigating after an anonymous... Child endangerment!
[00:56:45.214 --> 00:56:52.698]  See, they don't have anything they can charge him with for not filing the policy.
[00:56:52.698 --> 00:56:55.839]  So, child endangerment!
[00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:58.701]  I've got the law, there's nothing about child endangerment in here!
[00:56:58.701 --> 00:57:02.743]  See, when they arrest you for not inoculating, they don't arrest you for that, because there's no law!
[00:57:05.043 --> 00:57:05.804]  It's the same thing!
[00:57:05.804 --> 00:57:07.486]  It's just, it's unbelievable!
[00:57:07.486 --> 00:57:08.688]  They're hunting us!
[00:57:08.688 --> 00:57:13.715]  They're hunting, like Planet of the Apes, wild humans that aren't living in their slave pit!
[00:57:13.715 --> 00:57:14.256]  Continue!
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.382]  Under state law, a superintendent must approve a homeschooling curriculum.
[00:57:20.382 --> 00:57:26.025]  But according to investigators, the Cressy's never submitted one in the seven years they lived in the district.
[00:57:26.025 --> 00:57:27.106]  Oh my, they didn't submit it?
[00:57:27.106 --> 00:57:28.626]  So who should be held accountable here?
[00:57:28.626 --> 00:57:29.827]  Well, the parents.
[00:57:29.827 --> 00:57:30.927]  It's not the school's fault.
[00:57:30.927 --> 00:57:33.408]  The schools are doing the right thing.
[00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:38.091]  So see, this whole article, this whole piece is about how, oh, the government's not doing enough.
[00:57:38.091 --> 00:57:40.532]  They've got to track down more of these people that want to live free.
[00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:42.771]  And the cops are up there.
[00:57:42.771 --> 00:57:44.072]  Oh, this is very serious.
[00:57:44.072 --> 00:57:45.633]  These parents are very bad.
[00:57:45.633 --> 00:57:47.935]  We keep counting on the parents to do the right thing.
[00:57:47.935 --> 00:57:49.396]  Let me tell them something, though.
[00:57:49.396 --> 00:57:58.803]  Since last night, when I saw this article in the comments on the CBS News page, even before we linked to it and all our listeners went on there, it said, this is martial law.
[00:57:58.803 --> 00:58:00.964]  This is Nazi Germany.
[00:58:00.964 --> 00:58:02.325]  This story is baloney.
[00:58:02.325 --> 00:58:04.147]  These parents should not have been arrested for this.
[00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.648]  There's no abuse here.
[00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:08.250]  I'm sick and tired of our freedoms being stripped.
[00:58:12.714 --> 00:58:15.175]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:58:15.175 --> 00:58:19.557]  Every single commenter I see on here sees right through you.
[00:58:19.557 --> 00:58:22.339]  So keep shoveling your cult garbage.
[00:58:22.339 --> 00:58:25.480]  We don't want to be part of your parasite cult!
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.602]  You've already ruined and de-industrialized America.
[00:58:28.602 --> 00:58:33.604]  You spike our water with over 150 deadly chemicals known to sterilize and brain damage.
[00:58:33.604 --> 00:58:34.685]  But that isn't enough!
[00:58:35.663 --> 00:58:39.306]  We've got to give our children to you, just like in Egypt and Rome.
[00:58:39.306 --> 00:58:41.248]  The government wants your children.
[00:58:41.248 --> 00:58:42.369]  It's called slavery.

[01:00:20.165 --> 01:00:24.211]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.315 --> 01:00:32.020]  We are opening the phones in this hour before Alan Watt joins us in the next.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:38.206]  Specifically on your ideas to protest and boycott and stop the naked body scanners.
[01:00:38.206 --> 01:00:43.311]  This ritualization of submission to the pimp government.
[01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:45.033]  I'm gonna break that down.
[01:00:45.033 --> 01:00:49.618]  The attacks on homeschooling, arresting homeschooling parents across the country and in Europe.
[01:00:51.477 --> 01:01:04.904]  I specifically want to hear your take on how we're being domesticated and taken over on the homeschooling, on the animal ID, premises ID, and on the naked body scanners.
[01:01:04.904 --> 01:01:06.025]  That's the subjects.
[01:01:06.025 --> 01:01:06.945]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:06.945 --> 01:01:09.486]  I know some stations just joined us.
[01:01:09.486 --> 01:01:13.228]  CBS News out of a rural area of New York State.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:32.166]  In Glen Town, as it's called, this family, upstanding members of the community, homeschooling their children, they came and arrested them for homeschooling.
[01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:34.707]  Not registering their children with them.
[01:01:34.707 --> 01:01:36.628]  And states start this slow.
[01:01:36.628 --> 01:01:39.970]  Oh, just with the health department, that's the eugenics department,
[01:01:41.989 --> 01:01:43.290]  That's what CPS is under.
[01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.331]  Just send us a form so we know they're in school.
[01:01:45.331 --> 01:01:47.592]  And then it's, oh, comply with our curriculum.
[01:01:47.592 --> 01:01:49.053]  And, oh, we're banning that.
[01:01:49.053 --> 01:01:51.294]  California's already tried that and got beaten in court.
[01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:57.176]  They... The City of Austin policy is to get rid of roads and make you take trains and buses.
[01:01:57.176 --> 01:01:59.017]  That's the official policy.
[01:01:59.017 --> 01:01:59.758]  Same thing nationwide.
[01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:01.319]  They want you out of your cars.
[01:02:01.319 --> 01:02:02.539]  They want you bankrupt.
[01:02:02.539 --> 01:02:04.440]  They want your children in their schools.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.421]  They are a slave cult.
[01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:09.142]  We are becoming slaves.
[01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.243]  Finish up with the cop.
[01:02:11.837 --> 01:02:13.318]  ...be held accountable here.
[01:02:13.318 --> 01:02:14.518]  Well, the parents.
[01:02:14.518 --> 01:02:15.618]  It's not the school's fault.
[01:02:15.618 --> 01:02:21.460]  The schools are doing the right thing, trying to get the parents to file the proper paperwork, which they have now.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:25.262]  According to Hoffman, the Cresses have now submitted... Rewind it!
[01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:27.042]  File the proper paperwork!
[01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:29.803]  They didn't call them and say, hey, this is a little civil matter.
[01:02:29.803 --> 01:02:35.085]  No, they went and charged them with child endangerment because the CPS swore out an order.
[01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.266]  The CPS are now judge, jury, and executioner.
[01:02:37.266 --> 01:02:40.047]  They're little, petty, commissar, Stalin dictators.
[01:02:42.452 --> 01:02:47.734]  And then there's the media pushing the police, pushing, pushing the school, pushing the superintendent.
[01:02:47.734 --> 01:02:50.014]  You better arrest more people!
[01:02:50.014 --> 01:02:51.915]  See, that's how they create the false dichotomy.
[01:02:51.915 --> 01:03:00.918]  Now every person commenting on the CBS site says this is outrageous, this is Nazi Germany, this is police state, you people need to be sued, you're criminals.
[01:03:00.918 --> 01:03:03.559]  And they did misapply child endangerment to this.
[01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:07.033]  They made an example.
[01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:10.275]  But every person reading it and seeing it sees through it.
[01:03:10.275 --> 01:03:11.515]  Every person!
[01:03:11.515 --> 01:03:14.477]  I read the comments last night, hundreds of more today.
[01:03:14.477 --> 01:03:18.680]  Every one of them sees through you people!
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.561]  I think they've gone too far too fast.
[01:03:21.561 --> 01:03:25.944]  But see, the media creates the false dichotomy as if the police and school haven't done enough.
[01:03:25.944 --> 01:03:29.486]  Because people psychologically like to have a choice.
[01:03:29.486 --> 01:03:30.887]  And so the false choices put out
[01:03:31.826 --> 01:03:34.008]  You know, do we arrest them or do we take their children?
[01:03:34.008 --> 01:03:36.089]  You know, we arrested them, but is that enough?
[01:03:36.089 --> 01:03:40.192]  And what can we do more to hunt down these slaves?
[01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:42.133]  Instead of, was this right to do?
[01:03:42.133 --> 01:03:43.814]  How has America turned into this?
[01:03:43.814 --> 01:03:45.876]  Finish up the clip as this witch!
[01:03:47.177 --> 01:03:49.298]  This woman will be hurt by the government in her life.
[01:03:49.298 --> 01:03:49.878]  She will.
[01:03:49.878 --> 01:03:51.459]  She's drinking fluoride water.
[01:03:51.459 --> 01:03:52.819]  She's taking vaccines.
[01:03:52.819 --> 01:03:58.581]  When she gets cancer when she's 42 years old, she'll wonder why she's burning up with pain as she dies.
[01:03:58.581 --> 01:04:00.802]  And you will because you're scum, lady!
[01:04:00.802 --> 01:04:02.202]  You love evil, that's why!
[01:04:02.202 --> 01:04:06.424]  You love your nanny state that wants to slit your big fat throat.
[01:04:06.424 --> 01:04:07.264]  Go back to her!
[01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:10.311]  And he has approved it.
[01:04:10.311 --> 01:04:19.254]  Will anything be done differently from the school's point of view to make sure that schools or kids are being homeschooled correctly or?
[01:04:19.254 --> 01:04:24.275]  Well, we follow the law and the law requires us to make sure that certain steps are followed.
[01:04:24.275 --> 01:04:27.917]  Marcy Natal, CBS 6 News, Fonda.
[01:04:27.917 --> 01:04:30.557]  Totally disgusting!
[01:04:30.557 --> 01:04:33.058]  Totally sick!
[01:04:33.058 --> 01:04:37.000]  And listen to me, you slack-jawed, cowardly people.

[01:04:38.433 --> 01:04:51.803]  You may sit there in your comfortable little news job and laugh at me warning you about 150 plus chemicals Bare Venom are putting in your water, or how they're putting lithium in the water, or how they're putting cancer viruses and mercury in those shots, but I'm telling you the truth.

[01:06:02.998 --> 01:06:07.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.461]  Number one.
[01:06:08.461 --> 01:06:11.882]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:11.882 --> 01:06:12.743]  Number two.
[01:06:12.743 --> 01:06:17.645]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:17.645 --> 01:06:18.386]  It's true.
[01:06:18.386 --> 01:06:22.928]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:23.248 --> 01:06:24.069]  Number 3.
[01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:27.652]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:27.652 --> 01:06:31.576]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:31.576 --> 01:06:32.377]  Number 4.
[01:06:32.377 --> 01:06:35.139]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:35.139 --> 01:06:38.823]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:38.823 --> 01:06:39.623]  Number 5.
[01:06:39.623 --> 01:06:43.767]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:48.512]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:09.175]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:09.175 --> 01:08:14.319]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:14.319 --> 01:08:16.421]  Have you read the Declaration of Independence?
[01:08:16.421 --> 01:08:18.403]  What King George III was doing in our country?
[01:08:19.784 --> 01:08:25.528]  It wasn't one-tenth of the abuse and corruption that we're now under.
[01:08:25.528 --> 01:08:41.400]  By any yardstick, by any measurement, by any gauge, we are living in a science fiction-esque, satirical, over-the-top, ridiculous level of tyranny.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.442]  I mean, it's a joke it's so ridiculous.
[01:08:44.442 --> 01:08:45.163]  It's worse
[01:08:46.428 --> 01:08:53.674]  Than any Kurt Vonnegut novel about a futuristic police state on Titan.
[01:08:53.674 --> 01:08:54.814]  I mean, it is a joke.
[01:08:54.814 --> 01:09:01.960]  We are being inducted by a bunch of psychiatrists and psych warfare experts into a hellhole.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.864]  You know, when I get up here on air and I mention the Associated Press from, what was it, three, four years ago?
[01:09:06.864 --> 01:09:10.026]  And I've seen it all over the country, from Michigan, what was the headline?
[01:09:10.026 --> 01:09:13.669]  I know World and Net Daily did a story, we did a story at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:15.550]  That guy, search this right now for people.
[01:09:20.046 --> 01:09:26.111]  Michigan school drill demonizes homeschoolers.
[01:09:26.111 --> 01:09:27.032]  Or something like that.
[01:09:27.032 --> 01:09:33.718]  And I think the AP headline was, parents angry about police safety drill at school.
[01:09:33.718 --> 01:09:34.559]  Michigan.
[01:09:34.559 --> 01:09:35.760]  AP.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.064]  And then it says, and I've been to these drills.
[01:09:40.064 --> 01:09:41.645]  But I've been to announced ones.
[01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:44.728]  Once they get you trained to the announced ones.
[01:09:44.728 --> 01:09:46.710]  I went to one in Belton.
[01:09:47.722 --> 01:09:50.143]  Where they have regular army checkpoint drills.
[01:09:50.143 --> 01:09:52.444]  We have that in police state too, the takeover.
[01:09:52.444 --> 01:09:57.226]  The police come over with the military and say, turn your cameras off to Mike Hanson.
[01:09:57.226 --> 01:10:04.390]  Well, I'm up there in 2000, right before 9-11, and the mayor gets up and announced terrorists have hit Belton.
[01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:06.311]  We have video of this.
[01:10:06.311 --> 01:10:07.992]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:10:07.992 --> 01:10:12.374]  He says, terrorists have hit Belton.
[01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:13.014]  They attacked.
[01:10:14.753 --> 01:10:15.974]  But the Army responded.
[01:10:15.974 --> 01:10:18.395]  They had Army, Marine Corps, all of them out there.
[01:10:18.395 --> 01:10:19.816]  A robot with a shotgun.
[01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:23.338]  I have video of all of it.
[01:10:23.338 --> 01:10:27.500]  The Army tried to walk over and tell me to turn my cameras off and I didn't do the friendly thing.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:31.222]  I said, how dare you in America try to tell me what I can do!
[01:10:31.222 --> 01:10:34.063]  And they backed off real quick.
[01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:37.045]  Other people, when they come up and do that on the streets of America, coward.
[01:10:37.045 --> 01:10:40.066]  You saw me in Endgame.
[01:10:40.066 --> 01:10:42.808]  I had Army soldiers with 45 sidearms on.
[01:10:44.668 --> 01:10:50.593]  And I said, you get out of my face right now!
[01:10:50.593 --> 01:10:56.397]  This is America, scumbag!
[01:10:56.397 --> 01:10:57.798]  Don't you understand?
[01:10:57.798 --> 01:11:03.082]  They was never this bad in Russia.
[01:11:03.082 --> 01:11:06.705]  Russia would have never put naked body scanners in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:19.735]  I have had troops over and over again come up to me with firearms in America and tell me to turn my camera off!
[01:11:19.735 --> 01:11:22.515]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[01:11:22.515 --> 01:11:29.737]  I'm looking for peace and I want the people to revolt in the Info War, to get aggressive, to put flyers up for whatever issue you're concerned about.
[01:11:29.737 --> 01:11:33.397]  Vaccines, naked body scanners, whatever the case is.
[01:11:33.397 --> 01:11:35.918]  I want you to get aggressive calling to talk radio.
[01:11:35.918 --> 01:11:37.358]  I want people to get aggressive
[01:11:38.226 --> 01:11:42.868]  With legal micro-AM and FM.
[01:11:42.868 --> 01:11:47.829]  You can spread those out in your neighborhood, get a bunch of people to put them in your town, the small ones, and they're legal and lawful.
[01:11:47.829 --> 01:11:51.390]  Check your local and national laws on that.
[01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:55.231]  But it's time to get aggressive with these people.
[01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:57.312]  It's time to go to city councils.
[01:11:57.312 --> 01:12:03.354]  I'll guarantee you, no matter what town or city you live in, they're kidnapping kids quietly.
[01:12:03.354 --> 01:12:05.875]  I'll guarantee you, this evil's going on everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:07.987 --> 01:12:14.770]  And so, they have the city hall cordoned off with sawhorses.
[01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:18.531]  There's marines, there's army.
[01:12:18.531 --> 01:12:23.473]  There's people that say special forces patches on their arms that remove the patches when I started walking up.
[01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:27.755]  There's video of all this.
[01:12:27.755 --> 01:12:32.017]  Green berets.
[01:12:32.017 --> 01:12:33.817]  Some of them in plainclothes.
[01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:37.299]  And they were running a takeover op, getting to know Belton, taking it over.
[01:12:39.141 --> 01:12:41.922]  Running drills on the highways.
[01:12:41.922 --> 01:12:43.282]  And these troops walk over.
[01:12:43.282 --> 01:12:44.802]  And then more come over and get in my face.
[01:12:44.802 --> 01:12:46.642]  And I get in their face.
[01:12:46.642 --> 01:12:51.823]  One of them says, how dare you show my face at that checkpoint from two years before?
[01:12:51.823 --> 01:12:55.584]  And I'll say, we'll do whatever we want!
[01:12:55.584 --> 01:12:58.305]  So the Army's listed me as a terrorist and has them watching me.
[01:12:58.305 --> 01:13:02.045]  Because they are criminals and enemies of this country!
[01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.066]  Just like Hitler was an enemy of Germany.
[01:13:04.066 --> 01:13:05.706]  Can't you get that through your heads?
[01:13:07.193 --> 01:13:09.656]  I'M NOT THE ONE ENGAGED IN KILLING AMERICA!
[01:13:09.656 --> 01:13:14.080]  I REALLY DO LOVE GEORGE WASHINGTON!
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.082]  I REALLY DO LOVE THE RED, WHITE, AND BLUE!
[01:13:16.082 --> 01:13:17.704]  I KNOW WHAT AMERICA IS!
[01:13:17.704 --> 01:13:25.232]  AND YOU EITHER FORGOT WHAT IT WAS, OR YOU WERE NEVER TAUGHT, BOY!
[01:13:25.232 --> 01:13:27.655]  Watching this country die is killing me, man!
[01:13:27.655 --> 01:13:28.495]  It's killing me!
[01:13:30.436 --> 01:13:31.977]  I wish I was wrong about all this.
[01:13:31.977 --> 01:13:33.438]  I wish all years ago I was wrong.
[01:13:33.438 --> 01:13:35.499]  I was right about everything because I'd studied history.
[01:13:35.499 --> 01:13:39.021]  I knew how they took over other countries.
[01:13:39.021 --> 01:13:40.101]  I got three children.
[01:13:40.101 --> 01:13:41.102]  I have a family.
[01:13:41.102 --> 01:13:42.342]  I love this country so much.
[01:13:42.342 --> 01:13:47.365]  I got roots all the way into its founding, from before its founding.
[01:13:47.365 --> 01:13:49.566]  And I know you do too.
[01:13:49.566 --> 01:13:54.789]  And it just hurts me because you know when America goes tyranny, it's going to go worse than anything ever went.
[01:13:55.939 --> 01:13:58.401]  The bigger the sun, the bigger it goes supernova.
[01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:00.983]  The bigger the volcano, the bigger it blows.
[01:14:00.983 --> 01:14:05.325]  The bigger they are, the bigger they fall.
[01:14:05.325 --> 01:14:08.187]  And America is so horrible.
[01:14:08.187 --> 01:14:09.048]  It's so evil.
[01:14:09.048 --> 01:14:12.330]  It's the worst, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:17.474]  You know, in the last eight years, tourism is down close to 40% in the U.S.
[01:14:17.474 --> 01:14:18.855]  No one wants to come here.
[01:14:20.151 --> 01:14:26.613]  People from other countries know when they see police in black masks, man, this is North Korea or Mexico, I better get out of here.
[01:14:26.613 --> 01:14:31.394]  When people see cameras everywhere, tourism's down in England, they say, this isn't freedom, I'm out of here.
[01:14:31.394 --> 01:14:40.596]  When people, I mean, I've got mainstream news articles today where pro-war neocons assigned
[01:14:43.717 --> 01:15:00.701]  To the Pentagon as in bed reporters come back and have their laptops taken, have their email passcodes taken, the TSA sits there and reads your email in front of you, they ask how much money do you make and the guy wouldn't tell them after 20 questions or more and so they arrested him?
[01:15:00.701 --> 01:15:05.483]  That's on PrisonPlanet.com?
[01:15:05.483 --> 01:15:07.183]  And that's how it is now in Europe and Canada.
[01:15:12.896 --> 01:15:24.023]  I have been in rooms with Canadian police while they are laughing and smiling and saying, we're going to put you in prison and literally getting off on trying to scare me.
[01:15:24.023 --> 01:15:37.712]  I have seen them feeding in pure Soviet Nazi evil, screaming at me off and on for 15 hours, laughing at me, telling me I was going to go to a Canadian prison for no reason.
[01:15:42.034 --> 01:15:52.223]  In Rockwall, Texas, I had a school police officer before we moved here when I was a sophomore.
[01:15:52.223 --> 01:16:03.213]  I had him call me in and say, we know you're stealing stereo systems from Happy Country Homes, a trailer park 10 miles from where I lived.
[01:16:03.213 --> 01:16:06.475]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[01:16:06.475 --> 01:16:07.536]  Happy Country Homes?
[01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:15.255]  I think I'd been there one time to fly a remote control airplane with a friend years before.
[01:16:15.255 --> 01:16:15.856]  I told him that.
[01:16:15.856 --> 01:16:17.657]  He said, don't lie to me.
[01:16:17.657 --> 01:16:19.278]  I know you're stealing stereos.
[01:16:19.278 --> 01:16:25.383]  And ladies and gentlemen, I never stole anything but beer out of ice chest on the back of golf carts.
[01:16:25.383 --> 01:16:28.245]  I lived in the middle class golf cart neighborhood.
[01:16:28.245 --> 01:16:33.889]  By the time I was 14, a few times we'd be at the lake house or the country club and we'd laugh and reach in and get, I told him that.
[01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:35.010]  I said, I was taking beer.
[01:16:36.834 --> 01:16:43.159]  And he said, well, I know you really didn't steal that, but I'm going to charge you with it unless you start reporting to me on crime.
[01:16:43.159 --> 01:16:44.079]  And I said, crime?
[01:16:44.079 --> 01:16:51.044]  I mean, I was a jock, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:51.044 --> 01:16:54.127]  I was chasing cheerleaders.
[01:16:54.127 --> 01:16:59.611]  My only crime was when somebody punched me in the face, I'd punch them back a little too hard.
[01:17:00.694 --> 01:17:02.295]  And this was being done to everybody in the school.
[01:17:02.295 --> 01:17:04.856]  It was a giant brainwashing re-education center.
[01:17:04.856 --> 01:17:06.897]  What do you think goes on in a Soviet re-education center?
[01:17:06.897 --> 01:17:10.058]  Everything we're talking about here today.
[01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:14.700]  The traumatization, the threats, the telling people to report on folks, breaking everybody down.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.522]  And I knew that cop was involved in narcotics trafficking.
[01:17:18.522 --> 01:17:19.762]  Everybody knew.
[01:17:19.762 --> 01:17:25.044]  The sheriff had gone to jail for flying in cocaine.
[01:17:25.044 --> 01:17:26.785]  That guy owned businesses in town.
[01:17:26.785 --> 01:17:28.566]  That guy drove a brand new Corvette.
[01:17:33.558 --> 01:17:37.700]  I mean, this government is pure evil!
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.101]  I'm good!
[01:17:39.101 --> 01:17:40.122]  I'm straight!
[01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:41.163]  I'm strong!
[01:17:41.163 --> 01:17:42.163]  I'm not bad!
[01:17:42.163 --> 01:17:43.104]  You are!
[01:17:43.104 --> 01:17:47.406]  And you're not going to tell the American people they're bad anymore.
[01:17:47.406 --> 01:17:51.469]  And so in Belton, the mayor got up and announced they'd been hit by terrorists, and I instantly knew.
[01:17:52.571 --> 01:17:56.914]  That at the end of his 10-minute press conference he would then say, this is just a drill.
[01:17:56.914 --> 01:18:06.840]  They announced we've been hit, they announced terrorists have hit, and I instantly knew it would be in the newspaper the next day that they would write a whole article about how terrorists hit and then only at the end say it was just a drill.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:13.124]  To create and elicit the fear and to create the perception that terrorism was real.
[01:18:13.124 --> 01:18:17.707]  So that local communities could be fully federalized and accept covert Pentagon operations.
[01:18:17.707 --> 01:18:19.348]  From narcotics trafficking to you name it.
[01:18:22.099 --> 01:18:26.983]  And I went outside and more troops came over and threatened us and then they blew up a car.
[01:18:26.983 --> 01:18:30.245]  Fire shooting out.
[01:18:30.245 --> 01:18:37.750]  And then they had the local middle school drama team put fake blood all over them and roll around on the ground for news cameras.
[01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.612]  And that's all in Road to Tyranny.
[01:18:39.612 --> 01:18:41.053]  Now!
[01:18:41.053 --> 01:18:41.253]  Now!
[01:18:43.874 --> 01:18:45.635]  What do they do nationwide now?
[01:18:45.635 --> 01:18:53.479]  They go into public schools, children as young as five years of age, come in with men screaming, I'm going to kill you.
[01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:54.620]  I'm a homeschooler.
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.341]  I'm a gun owner.
[01:18:56.341 --> 01:18:59.763]  I'm a homeschooler against public education.
[01:18:59.763 --> 01:19:02.744]  That was in the federal script in Michigan.
[01:19:02.744 --> 01:19:03.645]  Done all over the state.
[01:19:05.205 --> 01:19:11.009]  And they take the kids out and blow up a bus and then throw buckets of fake blood on them.
[01:19:11.009 --> 01:19:12.870]  And the children scream and cry.
[01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:15.531]  We have video of it in Road to Tyranny from other schools.
[01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:16.852]  As little girls cry.
[01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:20.895]  Little 5, 6, 7 year olds with police dogs.
[01:19:20.895 --> 01:19:22.576]  This is the pure evil.
[01:19:22.576 --> 01:19:24.077]  The pure brainwashing.
[01:19:24.077 --> 01:19:26.318]  The pure scientific death.
[01:19:26.318 --> 01:19:28.940]  Oozing and creeping through every facet of our lives.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:31.041]  And I can see it!
[01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:32.442]  You can see it!
[01:19:32.442 --> 01:19:33.943]  You know what's going on!
[01:19:35.029 --> 01:19:42.334]  You take over your local towns, you can do it peaceably, if you get aggressive and serious and knock on every door.
[01:19:42.334 --> 01:19:56.064]  If our forefathers could walk in the snow until their feet bled, until there were trails of blood, the least you can do is bang on doors and warn people and go absolutely ape and expose these criminals.
[01:19:56.064 --> 01:20:02.709]  Your calls are straight ahead on the rape scanners and all the other engineering, psych warfare going on.
[01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:08.867]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[01:21:04.858 --> 01:21:08.887]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:08.887 --> 01:21:12.134]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:12.134 --> 01:21:13.536]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:14.241 --> 01:21:17.284]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:17.284 --> 01:21:23.309]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:23.309 --> 01:21:28.513]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:28.513 --> 01:21:38.501]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:38.601 --> 01:21:40.943]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:40.943 --> 01:21:42.544]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:42.544 --> 01:21:45.007]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:45.007 --> 01:21:47.128]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:47.128 --> 01:21:52.273]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:52.273 --> 01:22:01.401]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:03.393 --> 01:22:03.994]  Good day.
[01:22:03.994 --> 01:22:05.635]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:05.635 --> 01:22:06.116]  January 6, 2010.
[01:22:06.116 --> 01:22:07.017]  Gold open this morning at $11.2670.
[01:22:07.017 --> 01:22:10.400]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.5739, $5.7870 for a half-ounce, or $2.8935 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.021]  That's $11.5739, $5.7870, and $2.8935.
[01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:37.044]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:22:37.044 --> 01:22:38.284]  Is this capitalism?
[01:22:38.284 --> 01:22:45.887]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:45.887 --> 01:22:46.987]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:46.987 --> 01:22:51.129]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:22:51.329 --> 01:22:52.431]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.431 --> 01:22:53.694]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:22:53.694 --> 01:22:54.094]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:54.515]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:04.088 --> 01:23:06.269]  Is your computer running slowly?
[01:23:06.269 --> 01:23:08.029]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[01:23:08.029 --> 01:23:09.230]  Don't waste your money!
[01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:15.532]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:17.232]  You don't need to buy a new computer.
[01:23:17.232 --> 01:23:21.634]  Just go to DoubleMySpeed.com and find out what's slowing your computer down.

[01:23:29.496 --> 01:23:31.477]  My computer was on its last legs.
[01:23:31.477 --> 01:23:32.417]  Now it's like new again.

[01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:24.794]  The government knows what it's doing as the people arm themselves in mass and prepare for war.
[01:24:24.794 --> 01:24:27.096]  They want conflict.
[01:24:27.096 --> 01:24:34.502]  They want to baptize their paramilitary police in the fire of war.
[01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:37.024]  They want to plunge this country into civil war.
[01:24:38.766 --> 01:24:44.651]  They back the people into a corner.
[01:24:44.651 --> 01:25:01.505]  Each new outrage worse than the previous try to break our will and wed us to the blackest form of tyranny this planet has ever seen.
[01:25:01.505 --> 01:25:05.689]  We all need to prepare ourselves and to work as hard as we can
[01:25:07.805 --> 01:25:14.587]  To alert the people to the true enemy of humanity, the social engineers of the New World Order.
[01:25:14.587 --> 01:25:16.247]  Ron in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:25:16.247 --> 01:25:19.748]  Welcome.
[01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:22.449]  I see that the spirit of Crazy Horse has got you charged up again.
[01:25:22.449 --> 01:25:24.950]  That's great.
[01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:29.711]  First off, I want to make a quick comment in reference to the last bit of yesterday's transmission.
[01:25:31.502 --> 01:25:32.183]  Okay.
[01:25:32.183 --> 01:25:33.824]  You are not a bad person.
[01:25:33.824 --> 01:25:36.185]  You are doing everything you possibly can.
[01:25:36.185 --> 01:25:41.069]  I was being sarcastic when the guy called in griping, saying we didn't have MP3 files when we did.
[01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:42.110]  Yeah, I know.
[01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.910]  I know.
[01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:46.773]  But what has to be off is people like that.
[01:25:46.773 --> 01:25:55.800]  And like I called you once before, in reference to Ted Nugent and the apathy thing he mentioned, that is the example of what he was saying.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.142]  It is up to us to take what you give us and spread that out.
[01:26:01.115 --> 01:26:05.377]  There was a challenge that was given to me by a certain young lady to start up a website, and I did.
[01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:07.979]  Rytlesnakespit.com is just that.
[01:26:07.979 --> 01:26:15.943]  Now, as far as this scanning thing, I was using the same technology in Iraq at ECP-3.
[01:26:15.943 --> 01:26:18.844]  Our directive was not to scan females.
[01:26:18.844 --> 01:26:21.326]  Our directive was only to scan males.
[01:26:21.326 --> 01:26:27.449]  I was confronted by a CIA operative as to why we weren't doing the females.
[01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:29.310]  I said, it is immorally wrong.
[01:26:29.946 --> 01:26:32.187]  For one, and it was not my directive.
[01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.228]  He got mad.
[01:26:33.228 --> 01:26:40.971]  Now let's be clear, when you lock down a city or a town and are issuing people ID cards, correct me if I'm wrong, but I've seen it in person in military drills here in the U.S.
[01:26:40.971 --> 01:26:41.331]  and U.S.
[01:26:41.331 --> 01:26:45.133]  cities, they biometrically scan you and then give you an ID card.
[01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:49.015]  People don't know that this is really being used as a biometric scan.
[01:26:49.015 --> 01:26:51.376]  You may not have even been told.
[01:26:51.376 --> 01:26:57.039]  But let's point that out, that even in Iraq, and I'd also read that, that they weren't scanning females.
[01:26:57.759 --> 01:27:00.181]  So you were in Iraq and didn't want to scan females.
[01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:01.382]  What happened?
[01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:05.666]  Okay, I was confronted because I was the NCOIC of that operation at that time.
[01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:10.750]  The unit we took over for was having a memorial service for one of their fallen.
[01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:16.795]  And the unit we took over for even specifically told us they do not do the face scanning of the females.
[01:27:16.795 --> 01:27:19.598]  So we were following the same standard of operation policy.
[01:27:21.306 --> 01:27:29.989]  Now this particular person, I don't know if he was nude at that point or he was just getting fed up and not getting that information or what, confronted me about it.
[01:27:29.989 --> 01:27:32.910]  And I told him, no, I am not going to do it.
[01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:35.491]  That is immorally wrong on my behalf.
[01:27:35.491 --> 01:27:37.072]  You know how I would view it.
[01:27:41.383 --> 01:28:06.500]  Remember two years ago, the head of the Air Force, the civilian head of the Air Force, I forget his title, the Director of the Air Force, I believe, it was in the Associated Press, the headline was, Director of Air Force says, use sound and microwave weapons on citizens first, because under Geneva Convention, they couldn't use them on Iraqis, but then by deploying them in the U.S., they could then list it as not a weapon of war, and so now they've done that.
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:07.901]  It's the same thing with the scanners.
[01:28:07.901 --> 01:28:09.282]  We are the most enslaved.
[01:28:09.282 --> 01:28:09.602]  Go ahead.
[01:28:12.423 --> 01:28:20.346]  So, an alternative that they were doing was using the wands, all the females, and only the female interpreters we had were the only ones that were doing it.
[01:28:20.346 --> 01:28:22.867]  Anyway, in the confrontation, he said, well, I'm gonna go to your commander.
[01:28:22.867 --> 01:28:23.748]  Who's your commander?
[01:28:23.748 --> 01:28:25.508]  I said, I'm not gonna tell you.
[01:28:25.508 --> 01:28:26.569]  You find that out for yourself.
[01:28:29.955 --> 01:28:31.495]  How long were you in Iraq?
[01:28:31.495 --> 01:28:35.577]  When I talk about the military being turned against us, I know the military is really waking up.
[01:28:35.577 --> 01:28:37.378]  The police are waking up.
[01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:38.078]  Are you still in?
[01:28:38.078 --> 01:28:38.599]  Are you out?
[01:28:38.599 --> 01:28:40.559]  Do you talk to your buddies?
[01:28:40.559 --> 01:28:44.801]  I recently was medically retired just past October.
[01:28:44.801 --> 01:28:48.103]  Were people waking up to this insanity that's going on?
[01:28:48.103 --> 01:28:50.544]  There are quite a few, believe it or not, that are.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:58.424]  And there are quite a few, believe it or not, that know that there are these things that are going on that don't sit well in their gut.
[01:28:58.424 --> 01:28:59.405]  Well, here's an example.
[01:28:59.405 --> 01:29:02.287]  I have a lot of family in the military, a lot of them officers.
[01:29:03.363 --> 01:29:09.029]  And they've told me at barbecues and family events, they say, I don't even want anyone to know you're my family.
[01:29:09.029 --> 01:29:10.971]  I wouldn't get promoted if it was known.
[01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:13.553]  And they said, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:29:13.553 --> 01:29:15.395]  We are doing takeover drills.
[01:29:15.395 --> 01:29:18.298]  One of them is in logistics, not even in combat.
[01:29:18.298 --> 01:29:21.901]  He was in combat brigades before, but now he's over logistics.
[01:29:21.901 --> 01:29:25.224]  He said all of us are being trained for riot control.
[01:29:25.224 --> 01:29:27.387]  And the officers were told it's for America.
[01:29:27.867 --> 01:29:33.108]  They're training all units to take on the American people because the banks have robbed us blind.
[01:29:33.108 --> 01:29:33.749]  Stay there, Ron.
[01:29:33.749 --> 01:29:38.070]  I want you to finish up with your take on how we boycott these scanners, how we expose it.
[01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:39.650]  I got some of my own ideas coming up.
[01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:42.911]  And Virgil, Jason, John, John and others, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:50.113]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network trying to save the Republic.
[01:29:50.113 --> 01:29:54.174]  She is on live support right now.
[01:29:54.174 --> 01:29:55.575]  We're on the march.
[01:29:55.575 --> 01:29:57.095]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:58.090 --> 01:30:03.892]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.892 --> 01:30:06.893]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:06.893 --> 01:30:12.235]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:12.235 --> 01:30:14.276]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:14.276 --> 01:30:19.278]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:19.278 --> 01:30:20.198]  How much do you want?
[01:30:20.458 --> 01:30:21.579]  When do you want it?
[01:30:21.579 --> 01:30:23.461]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:23.461 --> 01:30:24.541]  When will you need it?
[01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:26.743]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:26.743 --> 01:30:28.084]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:28.084 --> 01:30:29.606]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:29.606 --> 01:30:34.870]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:38.453]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:38.453 --> 01:30:41.936]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:42.276 --> 01:30:43.497]  How much will you need?
[01:30:43.497 --> 01:30:44.398]  We don't know.
[01:30:44.398 --> 01:30:45.499]  How much do you want?
[01:30:45.499 --> 01:30:46.440]  All you can get.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.540]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:31:02.893 --> 01:31:09.878]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:31:09.878 --> 01:31:11.979]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:07.161]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:07.161 --> 01:32:11.505]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:11.505 --> 01:32:17.251]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:17.251 --> 01:32:22.556]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:22.856 --> 01:32:23.697]  Number 3.
[01:32:23.697 --> 01:32:27.280]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:31.203]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:31.203 --> 01:32:31.983]  Number 4.
[01:32:31.983 --> 01:32:34.745]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:34.745 --> 01:32:38.428]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:38.428 --> 01:32:39.229]  Number 5.
[01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:43.372]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:43.372 --> 01:32:48.136]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:48.416 --> 01:32:52.583]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.583 --> 01:32:54.386]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:54.386 --> 01:32:56.630]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:56.630 --> 01:32:58.974]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:19.492 --> 01:33:28.660]  Ron, anything else you wanted to add about body scanners in Iraq, not scanning women?
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:35.466]  I've seen blurbs, can't place when, years ago about the controversy of scanning Iraqi women.
[01:33:35.466 --> 01:33:38.909]  But again, American women and children, naked bodies, scan them.
[01:33:38.909 --> 01:33:41.031]  We're the home of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[01:33:42.529 --> 01:33:43.189]  Or are we?
[01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:49.672]  I have some ideas of ways to protest this, ways to boycott this, ways to educate people.
[01:33:49.672 --> 01:33:52.252]  And we're going to do that.
[01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:55.534]  But going back to Ron and then Virgil, Jason, John, John and others.
[01:33:55.534 --> 01:33:56.974]  Finish up, Ron.
[01:33:56.974 --> 01:33:58.014]  Here's the thing.
[01:33:58.014 --> 01:34:04.197]  Like I said, you know, I protested that, and of course I was only there just for that one time, just to fill in.
[01:34:04.197 --> 01:34:09.038]  And unfortunately I couldn't say, all I know is that when we were there, we didn't do it.
[01:34:09.038 --> 01:34:10.739]  You know, I told my guys, we're not going to do it.
[01:34:11.727 --> 01:34:14.568]  And I didn't care if I lost my rank or what.
[01:34:14.568 --> 01:34:17.649]  Because morally, I did not like the idea.
[01:34:17.649 --> 01:34:18.629]  You know.
[01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:27.151]  Now, as far as here, before I went in the Army, I had the fortunate ability to study law a little bit before I went into active duty.
[01:34:27.151 --> 01:34:39.234]  And I do know, and I kinda got the idea from Dr. Horowitz, in relation to the H1N1 vaccine, where people were filing injunctions in regards to
[01:34:40.325 --> 01:34:44.466]  Preventing being forced to take the vaccine.
[01:34:44.466 --> 01:34:45.626]  It is possible.
[01:34:45.626 --> 01:34:47.527]  I'm trying to look it up now for sure.
[01:34:47.527 --> 01:34:49.927]  We're going through the Code of Federal Regulations.
[01:34:49.927 --> 01:34:53.488]  In other cases, I haven't seen anything where it hasn't been done yet.
[01:34:53.488 --> 01:35:01.310]  But it is possible that we could all, as a people, file federal injunctions to keep us from being scanned.
[01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:06.836]  Because it is not a federally mandated law.
[01:35:06.836 --> 01:35:07.436]  Exactly.
[01:35:07.436 --> 01:35:08.358]  It's a regulation.
[01:35:08.358 --> 01:35:11.822]  It's a policy of TSA and Homeland Security and ICE.
[01:35:11.822 --> 01:35:19.311]  What they do is they come into a governmental system, an airport, public-private.
[01:35:19.311 --> 01:35:20.773]  They make deals with the airlines.
[01:35:21.892 --> 01:35:36.736]  The commercial aviation does it, nobody has to do it there to fly their Cessna or their private jet, or to charter a jet, and then everyone is herded through and indoctrinated, and now TSA says they're going nationwide with body scanners, random vans, checkpoints, it's already happening.
[01:35:36.736 --> 01:35:38.117]  This is so incredible.
[01:35:38.117 --> 01:35:41.197]  Yes, we need people to file injunctions.
[01:35:41.197 --> 01:35:50.380]  I was just talking to my IT guy a month ago, going through Houston, which I will not fly through, and I appreciate your call, Ron, I will not fly through George Herbert Walker Bush Airport.
[01:35:52.093 --> 01:36:06.060]  Because I've flown internationally through there twice, and literally, literally, they scream and yell at you and say, hustle, hustle, hustle, and they freak out and panic and they wave their arms.
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.042]  I mean, it's like animals or something.
[01:36:09.042 --> 01:36:12.624]  At the TSA.
[01:36:12.624 --> 01:36:16.446]  And my parents went to a wedding for one of my cousins in
[01:36:17.947 --> 01:36:32.036]  Mexico she got married down there one of those resort weddings and my poor grandmother who had polio in the 50s is on crutches 85 86 years old today I said what was it like when you went through Houston and they said it was hell
[01:36:33.283 --> 01:36:35.344]  Screaming at her to hurry up.
[01:36:35.344 --> 01:36:37.206]  I mean, it's shit, folks.
[01:36:37.206 --> 01:36:40.388]  They might as well just put us in loincloths and slave pits.
[01:36:40.388 --> 01:36:45.291]  Oh, but it's to keep us safe, because the government cares so much about us.
[01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:46.852]  Oh, yes.
[01:36:46.852 --> 01:36:49.814]  Everyone knows that's a fraud.
[01:36:49.814 --> 01:36:51.295]  The Pentagon conquered the world.
[01:36:51.295 --> 01:36:53.956]  They're now conquering us.
[01:36:53.956 --> 01:36:55.097]  And they mean to hurt us bad.
[01:36:55.097 --> 01:36:56.758]  And the average person in the military means well.
[01:36:56.758 --> 01:36:58.239]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:36:58.239 --> 01:37:02.382]  I've seen these new National Guard TV ads where they play all this crazy, creepy music.
[01:37:04.008 --> 01:37:07.751]  And it says mission comes first.
[01:37:07.751 --> 01:37:10.693]  Even above the Constitution is the message.
[01:37:10.693 --> 01:37:12.334]  Let's talk to Virgil in Oklahoma.
[01:37:12.334 --> 01:37:13.915]  Virgil, you're on the air.
[01:37:13.915 --> 01:37:15.997]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:18.318]  I'm just sick with anger and disgust.
[01:37:18.318 --> 01:37:19.479]  I mean, how obvious.
[01:37:19.479 --> 01:37:31.387]  How much more criminal is the government arresting homeschooler parents, naked body scanners spiking the water with poison, the media openly saying they want to put lithium in the water to make us feel better?
[01:37:31.387 --> 01:37:33.329]  Just wall-to-wall government tyranny.
[01:37:34.583 --> 01:37:36.064]  Oh man, keep up the fight.
[01:37:36.064 --> 01:37:42.308]  I wanted to let you know, sometimes you have a habit of answering my questions while I'm on hold.
[01:37:42.308 --> 01:37:52.055]  I've hung up on you a couple times, but I heard you mention earlier that your bloodline goes all the way back to the early American pre-revolution, and I wanted to let you know mine does as well.
[01:37:52.859 --> 01:37:58.370]  And also, here's an idea for stopping the whole subverting of human culture.
[01:37:58.370 --> 01:38:01.536]  Some hacker out there needs to turn off all the TVs.
[01:38:01.536 --> 01:38:03.119]  Just upload a virus to a satellite.
[01:38:03.119 --> 01:38:03.880]  Boom!
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:04.461]  Thanks all.
[01:38:04.461 --> 01:38:05.002]  Have a nice day.
[01:38:06.158 --> 01:38:14.462]  Well, Virgil, the issue is the government's already attacked their own satellites as a pretext to then bring in more controls.
[01:38:14.462 --> 01:38:17.283]  And that's not how the system's set up.
[01:38:17.283 --> 01:38:17.823]  Okay?
[01:38:17.823 --> 01:38:24.266]  You need to reach out and show people how they've been indoctrinated incrementally into total enslavement.
[01:38:24.266 --> 01:38:29.368]  And how the curtain's falling, the doors are shutting on freedom.
[01:38:29.368 --> 01:38:30.929]  Okay?
[01:38:30.929 --> 01:38:34.851]  And how it's their destiny and their responsibility to stand up against tyranny.
[01:38:38.686 --> 01:38:41.148]  John in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:43.129]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:48.793]  I just got a quick thing about the body scanning in the airport and stuff like that.
[01:38:48.793 --> 01:38:53.996]  Over the Christmas break here, I had a really good friend of mine travel in.
[01:38:53.996 --> 01:38:56.438]  He went to New Jersey and then came back.
[01:38:56.438 --> 01:39:00.640]  He had no problems getting there to New Jersey.
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.684]  And then they had the whole scare of the supposed bomber on Christmas Day.
[01:39:06.365 --> 01:39:08.166]  He returned three days ago.
[01:39:08.166 --> 01:39:09.346]  Um, he's on oxygen.
[01:39:09.346 --> 01:39:11.287]  He's got a COPD.
[01:39:11.287 --> 01:39:14.108]  He has to have oxygen to breathe.
[01:39:14.108 --> 01:39:25.853]  He has himself one of the portable, uh, portable concentrators that is FAA approved, weighs about 17 pounds, uh, flashing lights in the tubes and wires and stuff coming out of it.
[01:39:25.853 --> 01:39:28.614]  And they, uh, they gave him a hard time trying to get it through security.
[01:39:28.614 --> 01:39:31.576]  So they had him take it apart and they looked at it.
[01:39:31.576 --> 01:39:34.457]  Look, I've had GSA ask me what a video camera is.
[01:39:35.384 --> 01:39:42.229]  I mean, they take your laptops now and just keep them and take everything off of them, no warrant.
[01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:44.410]  It's just, it's total criminality.
[01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:53.296]  It's the Feds taking over the airports, now openly expanding all over the nation to warrantless checkpoints everywhere, with the Army and Marines.
[01:39:53.296 --> 01:39:59.520]  Well, so they, he gets on the plane and they tell him, they tell him he can't, he can't have it running.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:02.982]  And when this thing's not running, it's not pumping out oxygen, i.e.
[01:40:02.982 --> 01:40:03.643]  he can't breathe.
[01:40:04.389 --> 01:40:13.692]  So they let him, they were on the tarmac for about 15 minutes before they finally took off, and about a half hour later when they got to cruising altitude, okay, you can turn it on.
[01:40:13.692 --> 01:40:17.953]  The whole time the guy's having trouble trying to breathe and everything, he could have possibly died.
[01:40:17.953 --> 01:40:20.513]  But see, it's an act of submission.
[01:40:20.513 --> 01:40:22.334]  You will keep your face forward.
[01:40:22.334 --> 01:40:24.034]  You will not get up in the last hour.
[01:40:24.034 --> 01:40:25.775]  You will not cover your lap.
[01:40:25.775 --> 01:40:27.295]  You will wear a taser bracelet.
[01:40:27.295 --> 01:40:28.756]  We will scan your naked body.
[01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:30.056]  You will take your shoes off.
[01:40:30.316 --> 01:40:30.856]  Absolutely.
[01:40:30.856 --> 01:40:34.518]  So when I was talking to him about this yesterday, a lady overheard our conversation.
[01:40:59.392 --> 01:41:07.735]  She was all for the body scanners and this and that, and I was trying to explain to her why the body scanners were not cool.
[01:41:07.735 --> 01:41:11.676]  My whole point, I was trying to make... Well, see, notice, they say, Underwear Bomber, we're all in danger!
[01:41:11.676 --> 01:41:20.359]  By the way, we just so happen to just, you know, we're gonna put these scanners in next week, and now it's all over the news that they ordered the scanners a year before, just like I told you.
[01:41:20.359 --> 01:41:24.480]  It was all a staged event, ladies and gentlemen, all scripted to a T.
[01:41:25.615 --> 01:41:33.478]  My whole point I was trying to make to her that she, she couldn't understand is the fact that standing in the scanner is like standing inside of a microwave.
[01:41:33.478 --> 01:41:39.921]  So I took the, uh, I, I asked her if she would stand out in public naked with no clothes on, no bra, no underwear.
[01:41:39.921 --> 01:41:40.921]  Well, absolutely not.
[01:41:40.921 --> 01:41:42.462]  No, I wouldn't do that.
[01:41:42.462 --> 01:41:45.183]  And then I explained to her what the body scanners do.
[01:41:45.183 --> 01:41:51.606]  They, you sit there and they look at your naked body without your, basically with your consent and they record it.
[01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:54.293]  And she still didn't want to understand it.
[01:41:54.293 --> 01:42:01.344]  And she was trying to tell me it's prejudice to try to pick and choose who you can scan, and I mean... Oh yeah, that's part of the fake liberal religion.
[01:42:01.344 --> 01:42:06.071]  You know, even if you believe these Muslim extremists are trying to get us, in every case they're funded.
[01:42:06.929 --> 01:42:08.310]  And it's all staged.
[01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:10.091]  They go, well, we're liberal.
[01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:12.713]  Everyone gets body scanned, including the women.
[01:42:12.713 --> 01:42:15.195]  And that's all part of breaking up the family.
[01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:18.758]  Many colleges now have coed bathrooms.
[01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:22.520]  I mean, I don't like going in a bathroom and sitting on the commode next to a guy in the next stall.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.982]  I'll kind of wait till people are out of there.
[01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:30.786]  All over the country and in the military, you've got to sit there on a commode right next to a woman.
[01:42:30.786 --> 01:42:31.887]  Imagine what she thinks.
[01:42:31.887 --> 01:42:35.190]  Again, it's destroying all the existing order.
[01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:36.771]  Normal human activity.
[01:42:36.771 --> 01:42:40.834]  Because normal human instincts will make you stand up against being a slave.
[01:42:40.834 --> 01:42:42.835]  Family will make you stick up for your family.
[01:42:42.835 --> 01:42:48.399]  They are on record wanting to turn us into a bunch of drug zombies serving them.
[01:42:48.399 --> 01:42:49.200]  I appreciate your call.
[01:42:51.778 --> 01:42:56.239]  I've come up with some of my own ideas to stand up against this.
[01:42:56.239 --> 01:43:01.840]  And we're going to go back to John in England, Joe in Texas, and Ryan in Alaska, and then Alan Watts coming up.
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:05.980]  We're going to continue to have open phones with him.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:07.721]  But I want to give you some of my ideas right now.
[01:43:07.721 --> 01:43:11.401]  I'm formulating these and completing them by next week.
[01:43:11.401 --> 01:43:14.702]  And we'll launch the official operation.
[01:43:14.702 --> 01:43:16.302]  You're welcome to start your own operation.
[01:43:16.302 --> 01:43:19.543]  You're welcome to use our ideas and don't give us credit.
[01:43:19.543 --> 01:43:20.163]  I don't care.
[01:43:21.497 --> 01:43:25.919]  I want to win this mission.
[01:43:25.919 --> 01:43:30.201]  The costs are too high, ladies and gentlemen, if we let them win.
[01:43:30.201 --> 01:43:31.402]  The penalties are too high.
[01:43:31.402 --> 01:43:33.022]  There is no choice.
[01:43:33.022 --> 01:43:35.764]  This scum must be identified.
[01:43:35.764 --> 01:43:37.945]  The public must be given the basic information.
[01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:40.966]  Once they're given it, they'll start seeing it all for themselves.
[01:43:40.966 --> 01:43:45.168]  See, the enemy has to reapply lies every day.
[01:43:45.168 --> 01:43:47.809]  It's like a coat of paint that peels off every five minutes.
[01:43:47.809 --> 01:43:49.650]  The truth is a coat of paint that never peels off.
[01:43:51.567 --> 01:43:55.548]  We apply the truth, show somebody how to think, how they've been manipulated.
[01:43:55.548 --> 01:44:05.870]  One time, you get them to finally unlock, open their mind, and we're not filling people's minds with stuff.
[01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:08.911]  We're just saying, you folks, we've studied history.
[01:44:08.911 --> 01:44:10.331]  This is hardcore tyranny.
[01:44:10.331 --> 01:44:11.171]  Red alert.
[01:44:11.171 --> 01:44:12.871]  Please look around you.
[01:44:12.871 --> 01:44:20.073]  It's like having, you're out in the wilderness with a couple people and a bunch of wolves come to the rest of the hill and, uh,
[01:44:23.186 --> 01:44:27.187]  They're like blind.
[01:44:27.187 --> 01:44:32.468]  The best analogy is like having... There's ten people and nine of them are blind.
[01:44:32.468 --> 01:44:34.328]  And you hear the wolves howling and they're in denial.
[01:44:34.328 --> 01:44:35.189]  Oh, that's not wolves.
[01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:37.349]  You don't have any weapons and the wolves surround you.
[01:44:37.349 --> 01:44:39.210]  There's twenty, thirty wolves.
[01:44:39.210 --> 01:44:45.211]  And finally, when one of the people gets grabbed and dragged off and you hear them screaming and yelling in pain,
[01:44:46.964 --> 01:44:50.147]  And I'm not attacking blind people here, this is just an analogy.
[01:44:50.147 --> 01:44:56.033]  And the blind folks have been so conditioned that they look at you and say, are you hurting Bob to prove to us there are wolves?
[01:44:56.033 --> 01:44:59.977]  Are you doing that?
[01:44:59.977 --> 01:45:06.664]  That's how the basic psychology works.
[01:45:06.664 --> 01:45:09.226]  But the people are finally seeing the wolves for what they are.
[01:45:10.199 --> 01:45:18.185]  But the wolves have their own propaganda system of how they're not wolves, and how those of us trying to warn you are the wolves.
[01:45:18.185 --> 01:45:19.606]  Use your common sense, people.
[01:45:19.606 --> 01:45:20.727]  Have respect for yourselves.
[01:45:20.727 --> 01:45:22.368]  Now, I'll go ahead and throw these ideas out.
[01:45:22.368 --> 01:45:27.852]  Yes, we said yesterday, I'm getting a lot of emails about it, thinking it's a good idea.
[01:45:27.852 --> 01:45:36.559]  I'm not made out of money here, but we're going to have a $5,000 contest for the best naked body scanner poster.
[01:45:37.327 --> 01:45:40.388]  And follow your local laws, what's applicable.
[01:45:40.388 --> 01:45:48.652]  But I think if they're gonna naked body scan everybody, I personally am gonna put up some posters that show the image of the naked woman that we posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:45:48.652 --> 01:45:58.876]  People have a right to know what is really being seen.
[01:45:58.876 --> 01:46:04.859]  We're gonna have a boycott of the airlines and a boycott of the scanners poster contest.
[01:46:06.323 --> 01:46:10.845]  My wife had the idea of what we've seen PETA do.
[01:46:10.845 --> 01:46:17.168]  Couple good-looking PETA girls go to Tokyo, take their tops off, walk down Main Street.
[01:46:17.168 --> 01:46:20.869]  It's on the cover of USA Today and hundreds of newspapers and magazines.
[01:46:20.869 --> 01:46:26.452]  Now, most cities, and you can get them on discrimination if they arrest you.
[01:46:27.759 --> 01:46:32.001]  They've had the artist things with everybody by the thousands naked out in the town square.
[01:46:32.001 --> 01:46:38.205]  They've had the demonstrations where people are, you know, better go naked than fur for stupid issues.
[01:46:38.205 --> 01:46:45.949]  It's up to you to do this and it's, you know, your issue.
[01:46:45.949 --> 01:46:52.773]  You know there's tyrants out there, but don't get on the airport property, do it on the edge of the highway, on the sidewalk, wear panties.
[01:46:52.773 --> 01:46:55.715]  I don't think you should go completely naked, but you get
[01:46:56.897 --> 01:46:58.818]  A bunch of women.
[01:46:58.818 --> 01:47:00.398]  This is where women can save the Republic.
[01:47:00.398 --> 01:47:03.759]  I mean, you're going to be recorded anyways and put in a government database.
[01:47:03.759 --> 01:47:21.565]  You get a bunch of women, naked, to go to federal courthouses and TSA facilities and the outside of airports, and you stand out there with your placards and you call the media beforehand, and you come out there, ladies and gentlemen, it will devastate them.
[01:47:21.565 --> 01:47:23.426]  And you point out that
[01:47:25.529 --> 01:47:28.330]  That I don't want to be recorded naked in your database.
[01:47:28.330 --> 01:47:33.172]  This is what it... So the idiot public can get it.
[01:47:33.172 --> 01:47:40.636]  If we can beat these naked body scanners, where they want to set the precedent and make people do this, to where you submit to them, it's all about breaking your will.
[01:47:40.636 --> 01:47:44.678]  Breaking your soul.
[01:47:44.678 --> 01:47:46.158]  I don't want to horrify people.
[01:47:46.158 --> 01:47:47.799]  I actually don't look that bad naked.
[01:47:47.799 --> 01:47:51.981]  I've been told I look better naked than... But, for the country, I'll...
[01:47:54.321 --> 01:47:56.622]  I'll go out there and speed us.
[01:47:56.622 --> 01:47:59.663]  I just cannot do the whole deal.
[01:47:59.663 --> 01:48:19.871]  But, the stunt can save the Republic, and so we need to pick a date in the next month for simultaneously nationwide people to strip bare and go out and educate the moron population.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:26.964]  And you might get arrested, but then in court they'll have to drop it because it's all been held in the court cases.
[01:48:26.964 --> 01:48:34.210]  If it's free speech or it's done for art, they can't stop you.
[01:48:34.210 --> 01:48:42.397]  But ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, we have to do this.
[01:48:42.397 --> 01:48:45.200]  Desperate times mean desperate measures.
[01:48:47.392 --> 01:49:04.811]  nationwide naked protest to shock the public to bring it to a crisis point so people realize and call the local media national media will have a blackout on this but your local media will run with it and you can educate people about what's happening and say hey you think it's shocking to have adults out here naked
[01:49:05.632 --> 01:49:07.293]  Are in thongs.
[01:49:07.293 --> 01:49:10.115]  What about children being recorded by the TSA?
[01:49:10.115 --> 01:49:16.319]  You can hand out flyers with that image of the naked woman with her breast and her privates bare.
[01:49:16.319 --> 01:49:18.120]  We're going to make flyers.
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:23.584]  We'll take the winner of the contest.
[01:49:23.584 --> 01:49:25.745]  And I want to see people hit the ground running with this.
[01:49:25.745 --> 01:49:28.227]  We'll post the flyers that I think are the best.
[01:49:32.318 --> 01:49:34.239]  Maybe we have an InfoWars poll.
[01:49:34.239 --> 01:49:38.343]  Maybe we'll take the two or three best posters that I think are the best and let you vote.
[01:49:38.343 --> 01:49:39.643]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[01:49:39.643 --> 01:49:41.545]  We'll have them posted on a page of the poll.
[01:49:41.545 --> 01:49:44.027]  You can only vote once.
[01:49:44.027 --> 01:49:48.290]  And vote for what we think the winner is.
[01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:48.870]  $5,000.
[01:49:48.870 --> 01:50:01.500]  And then the best YouTube video made of the naked protest, the best video made of the bare-chested protest,
[01:50:03.288 --> 01:50:04.889]  We'll have that protest in a month.
[01:50:04.889 --> 01:50:06.150]  We'll set the dates next week.
[01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:07.590]  Simultaneous nationwide.
[01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:14.575]  Then a month after that, the best video on YouTube, you will get $10,000.
[01:50:14.575 --> 01:50:21.058]  That's $15,000 in prize money.
[01:50:21.058 --> 01:50:30.364]  Now, we're also going to launch pages with documents and issues about how this is all color of law and boycotting travel agencies.
[01:50:31.311 --> 01:50:32.472]  Boycotting the airlines.
[01:50:32.472 --> 01:50:34.192]  They've got the pressure points.
[01:50:34.192 --> 01:50:36.293]  They can stop it.
[01:50:36.293 --> 01:50:40.255]  To get the lobby, the defense lobby, that put these naked body scanners in.
[01:50:40.255 --> 01:50:41.636]  These are going in in the next three months.
[01:50:41.636 --> 01:50:43.376]  They're phasing them in right now.
[01:50:43.376 --> 01:50:49.659]  And here's the CBC, or CTV News, out of Canada.
[01:50:49.659 --> 01:50:52.360]  Ottawa ordered airline scanners months ago.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.601]  Well, of course.
[01:50:53.601 --> 01:50:54.461]  Same thing in the U.S.
[01:50:54.461 --> 01:50:55.742]  It's all staged.
[01:50:55.742 --> 01:50:58.043]  We're gonna fight back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:58.043 --> 01:50:58.523]  Be right back.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.201]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:51:06.201 --> 01:51:08.081]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:51:08.081 --> 01:51:09.941]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[01:51:09.941 --> 01:51:11.382]  We paid off all of our bills.
[01:51:11.382 --> 01:51:14.162]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[01:51:14.162 --> 01:51:19.804]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[01:51:19.804 --> 01:51:21.484]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:51:21.484 --> 01:51:24.085]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:51:24.085 --> 01:51:24.545]  NoMoreMortgage.
[01:51:26.585 --> 01:51:27.866]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:51:27.866 --> 01:51:30.368]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:51:30.368 --> 01:51:34.270]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:36.432]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[01:52:11.248 --> 01:52:14.969]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:23.250]  I think so.

[01:53:03.911 --> 01:53:05.232]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:05.232 --> 01:53:10.816]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:10.816 --> 01:53:15.840]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:21.404]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:53:21.404 --> 01:53:26.088]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:26.618 --> 01:53:33.744]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:33.744 --> 01:53:34.865]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:34.865 --> 01:53:41.551]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:41.551 --> 01:53:44.733]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:44.733 --> 01:53:46.955]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:46.955 --> 01:53:47.916]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:47.916 --> 01:53:48.116]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:55.754 --> 01:54:00.598]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:54:00.598 --> 01:54:15.290]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:18.352]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[01:54:18.352 --> 01:54:22.295]  It was back when the country was strong.
[01:54:27.582 --> 01:54:42.825]  We're gonna go to, uh, John, Joe, Ryan, and John, and we got Alan Watt coming up.
[01:54:42.825 --> 01:54:48.266]  So there, I'm putting $15,000 on the line.
[01:54:48.266 --> 01:54:49.706]  I'm putting $15,000 on the line.
[01:54:49.706 --> 01:54:53.807]  $5,000 for the poster contest that needs to start now.
[01:54:53.807 --> 01:54:56.127]  I'll tell ya that the contest will end a month from now.
[01:54:57.352 --> 01:54:59.753]  And we'll get rules up the next few days, but it's simple.
[01:54:59.753 --> 01:55:05.116]  The best way to educate people about the naked body scanners.
[01:55:05.116 --> 01:55:09.998]  And... You know what?
[01:55:09.998 --> 01:55:10.458]  5,000 more!
[01:55:10.458 --> 01:55:11.139]  I'll do another.
[01:55:11.139 --> 01:55:11.639]  I don't care.
[01:55:11.639 --> 01:55:14.080]  I'll blow all the money we've got to stop these scanners.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.121]  This is the key issue.
[01:55:17.121 --> 01:55:20.263]  5,000 for the best legal stunt.
[01:55:20.263 --> 01:55:22.004]  The best stunt you can pull.
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:26.563]  On TV, radio, there's a lot of things you can do.
[01:55:26.563 --> 01:55:28.664]  Banner hangs.
[01:55:28.664 --> 01:55:30.946]  $5,000 for the best stunt video.
[01:55:30.946 --> 01:55:32.707]  You gotta shoot it.
[01:55:32.707 --> 01:55:33.187]  Post it.
[01:55:33.187 --> 01:55:35.669]  $5,000 for the best stunt video.
[01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:38.171]  Paid in one month and announced.
[01:55:38.171 --> 01:55:39.092]  Hundreds will make videos.
[01:55:39.092 --> 01:55:41.033]  We all win in the fight.
[01:55:41.033 --> 01:55:45.417]  $5,000 for the best poster and the best video of that poster.
[01:55:45.417 --> 01:55:48.819]  And $10,000 for the naked protest.
[01:55:48.819 --> 01:55:49.720]  Follow local laws.
[01:55:52.507 --> 01:55:52.527]  $20,000!
[01:55:52.527 --> 01:56:02.854]  $20,000 and all the prudes will say, oh my gosh, naked bodies.
[01:56:02.854 --> 01:56:04.115]  That's so immoral.
[01:56:04.115 --> 01:56:06.617]  But guarantee that they're the fake Republican types.
[01:56:06.617 --> 01:56:10.180]  They're like, oh, videotaping four-year-old girls and boys.
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:12.341]  Wonderful!
[01:56:12.341 --> 01:56:13.662]  In the government centers.
[01:56:13.662 --> 01:56:15.744]  I'm sick of it!
[01:56:15.744 --> 01:56:17.225]  You heard the officer earlier.
[01:56:18.885 --> 01:56:23.609]  They wouldn't naked body scan women in Iraq, only men at the prisons.
[01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:31.435]  But they will, American slaves!
[01:56:31.435 --> 01:56:34.918]  $20,000 in prize money.
[01:56:34.918 --> 01:56:39.401]  Three different contests.
[01:56:39.401 --> 01:56:46.347]  And hey, donors out there, listeners out there, if you've got an idea for a contest, and I think it's kosher,
[01:56:49.161 --> 01:56:52.123]  You want to give me the money, put the money up for the contest?
[01:56:52.123 --> 01:56:55.525]  I'll run the contest on something else!
[01:56:55.525 --> 01:56:56.805]  It's hard to judge all these, though.
[01:56:56.805 --> 01:57:00.728]  It takes up so much time, but I don't care.
[01:57:00.728 --> 01:57:01.948]  They're very successful.
[01:57:01.948 --> 01:57:04.069]  Look at the Obama Joker poster contest.
[01:57:04.069 --> 01:57:10.313]  Speaking of that, we've sold out of some of the sizes, but we still have a lot of the sizes for the Obama Joker shirt.
[01:57:10.313 --> 01:57:11.253]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[01:57:11.253 --> 01:57:14.195]  I'm never printing any more of these.
[01:57:14.195 --> 01:57:14.976]  You can get a free
[01:57:16.377 --> 01:57:18.238]  By the way, add that George Bush t-shirt on there.
[01:57:18.238 --> 01:57:19.538]  Two-minute of a George Bush t-shirt.
[01:57:19.538 --> 01:57:21.399]  Have Tim add that.
[01:57:21.399 --> 01:57:24.180]  You get one of those free when you order Fall of the Republic in-game.
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:25.461]  You can also get Reflections and Warnings.
[01:57:25.461 --> 01:57:28.722]  They're in-game free when you get Fall of the Republic.
[01:57:28.722 --> 01:57:30.683]  And just get to film and make copies and give it to everybody.
[01:57:30.683 --> 01:57:33.024]  It's having such a giant effect.
[01:57:33.024 --> 01:57:38.226]  Infowars.com, the secure online video bookstore, shopping cart, the apparel area, the bumper stickers.
[01:57:38.226 --> 01:57:41.027]  It's all about getting the word out and supporting this broadcast.
[01:57:41.027 --> 01:57:42.628]  And we take the money that comes in here,
[01:57:43.635 --> 01:57:45.897]  And we put 90% of it back.
[01:57:45.897 --> 01:57:50.001]  I take about 10% to run my own life and operation.
[01:57:50.001 --> 01:57:58.648]  Or actually less, but the point is, funding our operation, funding what we do here.
[01:57:58.648 --> 01:58:01.631]  Purchase the books, purchase the videos, they're incredibly discounted.
[01:58:02.711 --> 01:58:04.952]  Five-plus months free until next Friday.
[01:58:04.952 --> 01:58:06.133]  It's the last day.
[01:58:06.133 --> 01:58:10.035]  We do it every December into January at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:10.035 --> 01:58:12.596]  We're going live at the 8 after, by the way, for the last hour and 52 minutes.
[01:58:12.596 --> 01:58:14.637]  Some days we do the whole four hours, some days three hours.
[01:58:14.637 --> 01:58:16.898]  We always do at least most of the last two hours.
[01:58:16.898 --> 01:58:20.180]  PrisonPlanet.tv, streamed to you, archives of it.
[01:58:21.209 --> 01:58:22.330]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:22.330 --> 01:58:23.550]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:55.319 --> 01:58:59.280]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:08.141]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:59:08.141 --> 01:59:12.762]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:59:12.762 --> 01:59:23.584]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:59:24.224 --> 01:59:33.726]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:33.726 --> 01:59:39.168]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:59:39.168 --> 01:59:46.649]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:46.649 --> 01:59:49.390]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:59:56.528 --> 01:59:58.909]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:58.909 --> 02:00:08.252]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:08.252 --> 02:00:09.553]  Big Brother.
[02:00:09.553 --> 02:00:11.313]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:11.313 --> 02:00:13.074]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:13.074 --> 02:00:14.654]  You want answers?
[02:00:14.654 --> 02:00:15.575]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:15.575 --> 02:00:20.396]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:20.396 --> 02:00:24.458]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.684 --> 02:00:27.665]  I love liberty.
[02:00:27.665 --> 02:00:28.465]  I love life.
[02:00:28.465 --> 02:00:29.426]  I love gusto.
[02:00:29.426 --> 02:00:30.187]  I love freedom.
[02:00:30.187 --> 02:00:31.728]  I love honor.
[02:00:31.728 --> 02:00:36.772]  And I'm not letting a bunch of pot-bellied, demonic, psych-warfare experts take over our society.
[02:00:36.772 --> 02:00:40.815]  And I know you're not as well.
[02:00:40.815 --> 02:00:42.496]  John in England, you're on the air.
[02:00:42.496 --> 02:00:45.298]  We're steaming towards Alan Watt in T-minus seven minutes.
[02:00:45.298 --> 02:00:46.759]  Go ahead, John.
[02:00:46.759 --> 02:00:47.820]  Can you hear me?
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.341]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:49.341 --> 02:00:54.385]  Right, um... You know, one of the biggest tricks of the New World Order, the scientific dictatorship,
[02:00:54.949 --> 02:00:56.873]  Yeah, and I feel powerful!
[02:01:02.275 --> 02:01:13.399]  In order to beat these people, what we have to do is we have to take our power back and take inspiration from Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Henry Thoreau, and become civil rights leaders.
[02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:17.901]  We can't sit there on our asses getting fat, waiting for someone else to go out and change the world for us.
[02:01:17.901 --> 02:01:22.842]  But I agree with you, but the system, it tells us who the new civil rights activists are.
[02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:27.284]  You know, the new civil rights is the government being able to teach seven-year-olds how to fist.
[02:01:28.418 --> 02:01:34.281]  And the new civil right is having your children body scanned by the pervert government that sexually tortures everybody worldwide.
[02:01:34.281 --> 02:01:35.821]  That's their favorite.
[02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:39.122]  We need to define that it's liberty and freedom in the Constitution.
[02:01:39.122 --> 02:01:40.383]  Go ahead.
[02:01:40.383 --> 02:01:41.083]  Exactly.
[02:01:41.083 --> 02:01:49.307]  What they've done is they've co-opted all these wonderful causes such as freedom and liberty and libertarianism, and they've perverted them.
[02:01:50.971 --> 02:01:53.834]  Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve claiming to be a libertarian.
[02:01:53.834 --> 02:01:55.715]  It's just complete rubbish.
[02:01:55.715 --> 02:01:57.997]  They've taken all these noble causes and they've perverted them.
[02:01:57.997 --> 02:01:59.298]  We have to take them back.
[02:01:59.298 --> 02:02:01.840]  We have to take them back ourselves as civil rights leaders.
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:05.684]  And we have to identify the system as criminal and lying scum.
[02:02:07.361 --> 02:02:08.542]  Absolutely.
[02:02:08.542 --> 02:02:09.563]  Absolutely.
[02:02:09.563 --> 02:02:14.308]  Look, look, 50 years ago everybody knew not to trust the government and to keep it small.
[02:02:14.308 --> 02:02:15.530]  Okay, it's common sense.
[02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:25.300]  We're going to get hurt real bad by it and learn the lesson, but the globalists have studied revolutions and resistance and peaceful renaissance and they are scientifically trying to block it.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:27.380]  Exactly.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:30.161]  And they take it from the left and they take it from the right.
[02:02:30.161 --> 02:02:32.542]  That's the false left-right paradigm.
[02:02:32.542 --> 02:02:37.163]  They co-opt everything and they pervert everything and they twist everything.
[02:02:37.163 --> 02:02:43.565]  But we have to take back these wonderful ideas from Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
[02:02:43.565 --> 02:02:45.925]  And be civil rights leaders ourselves and get out there.
[02:02:45.925 --> 02:02:47.846]  And that's what groups like We Are Change are trying to do.
[02:02:47.846 --> 02:02:50.027]  That's what I'm trying to do as an individual.
[02:02:50.027 --> 02:02:52.247]  And that's what I believe you're trying to do, Alex.
[02:02:52.247 --> 02:02:54.868]  And I really appreciate the help that you've given to
[02:02:56.507 --> 02:02:58.429]  Well, thank you, my friend.
[02:02:58.429 --> 02:02:59.410]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:59.410 --> 02:03:03.533]  Good to hear from you, John, in England.
[02:03:03.533 --> 02:03:07.376]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Texas.
[02:03:07.376 --> 02:03:12.761]  You're on the air, Joe.
[02:03:12.761 --> 02:03:16.004]  Yeah, you gave me a fresh list, but then... Let me see.
[02:03:16.004 --> 02:03:16.964]  Ryan in Alaska.
[02:03:16.964 --> 02:03:17.325]  Go ahead.
[02:03:17.325 --> 02:03:19.787]  Hey, am I there?
[02:03:19.787 --> 02:03:20.027]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:20.802 --> 02:03:33.659]  Yeah, Alex, I know you don't like bothering celebrities with this kind of stuff, but a couple articles on Prison Planet mentioned that they're going to be bothered with this stuff, too, and people are going to be paying for naked images of them.
[02:03:33.659 --> 02:03:34.841]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:03:34.841 --> 02:03:37.965]  I may have woken up
[02:03:39.063 --> 02:03:45.387]  A lot of people and may have talked to this person a couple times or had this person call me a few times.
[02:03:45.387 --> 02:03:51.931]  I may know that Bruce Willis was woken up by myself and that's on record.
[02:03:51.931 --> 02:03:54.893]  I may have woken up Keanu Reeves.
[02:03:54.893 --> 02:03:56.714]  I may have woken up Charlie Sheen.
[02:03:56.714 --> 02:03:59.096]  I may have woken up Brad Pitt, but good luck
[02:03:59.736 --> 02:04:05.060]  Getting anybody but Charlie Sheen, because he's a wild man, he's a real person, to go out and do something public.
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:10.263]  I've talked to a lot of these people, a lot of other names, some of them even bigger than the ones I just listed.
[02:04:10.263 --> 02:04:13.045]  If it's actually possible, yes, it is.
[02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:16.047]  You know, icons of Hollywood know what's going on.
[02:04:16.047 --> 02:04:20.710]  And they all know Hollywood's almost completely dominated by CIA and Justice Department.
[02:04:20.710 --> 02:04:22.051]  They know they'll be destroyed.
[02:04:22.051 --> 02:04:25.534]  I mean, you heard on air, or did he say it on air?
[02:04:26.394 --> 02:04:31.186]  Yeah, Braverman, big TV producer, he talked about how Spielberg basically runs Hollywood.
[02:04:31.186 --> 02:04:32.750]  If he doesn't like it, he gets it shut down.
[02:04:33.373 --> 02:04:38.774]  You know, because they know if they lose Hollywood, they lose everything.
[02:04:38.774 --> 02:04:43.755]  They either have to be fake right-wing like Tom Selleck or a fake liberal like Barbra Streisand.
[02:04:43.755 --> 02:04:55.178]  Everybody's on a reservation in this mind cult, this government cult, that tells us what we can do, how we can do it, how we must behave, how we must act, how we must think.
[02:04:55.178 --> 02:04:56.558]  Anything else, Brian?
[02:04:57.418 --> 02:04:57.918]  Uh, no, that's it.
[02:04:57.918 --> 02:04:58.739]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:04:58.739 --> 02:04:59.680]  God bless you, sir.
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:04.703]  Yes, I... I may know a lot of these people, but I can't get them to do anything.
[02:05:04.703 --> 02:05:08.725]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:08.725 --> 02:05:11.967]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:11.967 --> 02:05:16.770]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:23.154]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:23.154 --> 02:05:25.396]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:25.896 --> 02:05:26.236]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:26.236 --> 02:05:26.737]  Bernanke?
[02:05:26.737 --> 02:05:27.317]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:27.317 --> 02:05:28.078]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:28.078 --> 02:05:30.200]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:44.833 --> 02:05:46.674]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:05:46.674 --> 02:05:52.097]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:52.097 --> 02:06:01.222]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:03.919 --> 02:06:06.940]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:12.263]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:12.263 --> 02:06:14.304]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:14.304 --> 02:06:19.306]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:19.306 --> 02:06:20.486]  How much do you want?
[02:06:20.486 --> 02:06:21.627]  When do you want it?
[02:06:21.627 --> 02:06:23.508]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:23.508 --> 02:06:24.588]  When will you need it?
[02:06:24.588 --> 02:06:26.789]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:26.789 --> 02:06:28.130]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:28.130 --> 02:06:29.650]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:29.650 --> 02:06:30.711]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:06:30.851 --> 02:06:32.173]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:06:32.173 --> 02:06:34.896]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:34.896 --> 02:06:38.501]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:38.501 --> 02:06:42.326]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:42.326 --> 02:06:43.547]  How much will you need?
[02:06:43.547 --> 02:06:44.448]  We don't know.
[02:06:44.448 --> 02:06:45.550]  How much do you want?
[02:06:45.550 --> 02:06:46.291]  All you can get.
[02:06:46.291 --> 02:06:47.292]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:47.552 --> 02:06:50.616]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:06:52.398 --> 02:06:53.319]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:04.420]  What's your home worth?
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:06.521]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:07:06.521 --> 02:07:09.562]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:07:09.562 --> 02:07:17.284]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[02:08:05.019 --> 02:08:15.647]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.647 --> 02:08:16.728]  In the next two days,
[02:08:19.082 --> 02:08:30.826]  I am going to write up the rules for the contest we're launching to expose the naked body scanners that the London Guardian reports, according to British law, is child pornography.
[02:08:30.826 --> 02:08:36.208]  It's going in Europe, England, the United States and Canada simultaneously from two major companies.
[02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:39.589]  Billions of dollars of these were ordered in the last year
[02:08:40.209 --> 02:08:41.430]  Set to go in this year.
[02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:45.111]  They have the underwear bomber clearly staged to fear monger everyone.
[02:08:45.111 --> 02:08:47.633]  To go, oh, I guess we've got a naked body scan.
[02:08:47.633 --> 02:08:52.955]  The troops in Iraq in the prisons and at checkpoints wouldn't even body scan women.
[02:08:52.955 --> 02:08:56.777]  In fact, pull up the photo from yesterday for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:08:56.777 --> 02:08:58.818]  The news shows you blurred out images.
[02:08:58.818 --> 02:09:01.059]  This is what's really being recorded.
[02:09:01.059 --> 02:09:02.860]  And the people have a right to know.
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:05.821]  Full genitalia, full breast, everything.
[02:09:07.486 --> 02:09:10.067]  And they're going to do this to your children, your wife, everyone.
[02:09:10.067 --> 02:09:12.368]  They're going in everywhere.
[02:09:12.368 --> 02:09:13.948]  We need lawsuits to be filed.
[02:09:13.948 --> 02:09:15.689]  We need injunctions to be filed.
[02:09:15.689 --> 02:09:17.950]  We need protests of the stock of these companies.
[02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:23.792]  Find out if your 401k has a mutual fund or something in it, or in your money market that owns these companies.
[02:09:23.792 --> 02:09:26.393]  We're going to be cataloging.
[02:09:26.393 --> 02:09:28.313]  I need people out there to catalog all this.
[02:09:28.313 --> 02:09:32.355]  We have limited staff, but we're going to launch that to boycott and protest that.
[02:09:33.410 --> 02:09:35.231]  To educate the public?
[02:09:35.231 --> 02:09:41.732]  Because if they can break our will with naked body scanners and let you be publicly humiliated and break your spirit, they can get away with anything.
[02:09:41.732 --> 02:09:44.353]  First, it's thumbprinting and face scanning to get driver's license.
[02:09:44.353 --> 02:09:50.455]  Then it's take your shoes off, your belt off, answer questions, not being able to have a blanket in your lap on a plane.
[02:09:50.455 --> 02:09:54.856]  If you're in the toilet more than 10 minutes, they land the plane, it's national news.
[02:09:54.856 --> 02:09:58.437]  All these acts of submission, all these acts of supplication,
[02:09:59.687 --> 02:10:00.628]  We're going to hit them hard.
[02:10:00.628 --> 02:10:03.869]  We have a listenership of millions of people.
[02:10:03.869 --> 02:10:05.750]  Hundreds of newspapers.
[02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:07.031]  I didn't even count it.
[02:10:07.031 --> 02:10:08.212]  30, 40, 50 more.
[02:10:08.212 --> 02:10:11.494]  Japanese TV, British TV, Canadian TV, U.S.
[02:10:11.494 --> 02:10:14.055]  TV, national TV, local TV.
[02:10:14.055 --> 02:10:14.955]  Hundreds of papers.
[02:10:14.955 --> 02:10:16.256]  The local paper's in Austin.
[02:10:16.256 --> 02:10:18.097]  The paper's south of me.
[02:10:18.097 --> 02:10:21.459]  Front page, the Obama Joker poster.
[02:10:21.459 --> 02:10:23.860]  We make the Obama Joker poster.
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:25.801]  We have a contest.
[02:10:25.801 --> 02:10:26.742]  What, folks won $5,000 for that?
[02:10:29.622 --> 02:10:31.725]  They tried to intimidate people and said they couldn't do it.
[02:10:31.725 --> 02:10:33.226]  People resisted the intimidation.
[02:10:33.226 --> 02:10:35.569]  They posted them everywhere.
[02:10:35.569 --> 02:10:41.016]  And it took this image of this God Obama and showed him for what he really is, a criminal thug.
[02:10:41.016 --> 02:10:44.059]  We defiled their God, their big daddy figure.
[02:10:45.137 --> 02:10:50.622]  And it was also an exercise in showing the people the power of just pamphleteering.
[02:10:50.622 --> 02:10:56.428]  Just posting posters in your local area where other people post them where it's legal and lawful or common law and lawful.
[02:10:56.428 --> 02:11:01.052]  They can't selectively enforce and say, oh, we've got some old county rule that you can't.
[02:11:01.052 --> 02:11:06.438]  We'll have everybody else post up, but you can't.
[02:11:06.438 --> 02:11:09.401]  $5,000 starting now, in one month, for the best video
[02:11:10.711 --> 02:11:17.373]  And I'd like it to be posted to YouTube, because that's where over half the video views are going on, but you ought to dopplegang it and post it somewhere else as well.
[02:11:17.373 --> 02:11:19.754]  We're going to create the contest pages.
[02:11:19.754 --> 02:11:22.695]  $5,000 for that.
[02:11:22.695 --> 02:11:30.897]  $10,000 for the best naked protest.
[02:11:30.897 --> 02:11:37.419]  Now, follow your local laws, but all over the country, the courts have found for art or for protest, people are allowed to be nude.
[02:11:37.419 --> 02:11:39.460]  I suggest you wear Speedos or something.
[02:11:40.296 --> 02:11:43.698]  And obviously, attractive women, you want to fight the new world order?
[02:11:43.698 --> 02:11:45.718]  This is a way to smash them.
[02:11:45.718 --> 02:11:48.580]  You're going to be recorded naked and kept by the government.
[02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:50.120]  They're going to then make your children do it.
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:52.562]  To save the children, we have to do this.
[02:11:52.562 --> 02:11:57.124]  Look at this beautiful, young, 20-something-year-old woman, completely naked.
[02:11:57.124 --> 02:11:58.984]  Look at her breast.
[02:11:58.984 --> 02:12:00.005]  Look at her body.
[02:12:00.005 --> 02:12:00.805]  Look at her.
[02:12:00.805 --> 02:12:01.966]  That is what they're seeing.
[02:12:03.058 --> 02:12:11.296]  And I told you, Homeland Security is now saying, and the former head of British security, in fact, I forgot to print that article.
[02:12:11.296 --> 02:12:12.138]  It's on Prison Planet.
[02:12:13.004 --> 02:12:27.255]  I told people on Monday, came out yesterday, they're now proposing even more high-powered scanners that see into the body for hidden bombs under the skin because they could sew up a bomb under their skin and un-sew it in the bathroom.
[02:12:27.255 --> 02:12:30.697]  Oh, we need to wear taser bracelets, they're now saying, or maybe Al-Qaeda will get us.
[02:12:30.697 --> 02:12:32.138]  See, I was just always more, more, more.
[02:12:32.138 --> 02:12:36.722]  We're going to Alan Watt for the balance of the two-hour broadcast here in just a moment.
[02:12:36.722 --> 02:12:41.926]  We're now, again, 12 minutes into the third hour today, four-hour transmission Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:12:41.926 --> 02:12:42.186]  Eastern.
[02:12:43.786 --> 02:12:44.046]  11 a.m.
[02:12:44.046 --> 02:12:44.766]  to 3 p.m.
[02:12:44.766 --> 02:12:48.407]  Central.
[02:12:48.407 --> 02:12:51.788]  $5,000 for the protest of the body scanners.
[02:12:51.788 --> 02:12:52.608]  Launching now.
[02:12:52.608 --> 02:12:54.949]  One month from now, the videos will all be posted.
[02:12:54.949 --> 02:12:57.370]  We'll post them as they come in.
[02:12:57.370 --> 02:13:01.050]  And you'll win $5,000.
[02:13:01.050 --> 02:13:07.712]  $10,000 for the best video shot.
[02:13:07.712 --> 02:13:10.373]  Can you imagine the level of views these are going to get?
[02:13:11.311 --> 02:13:18.644]  People will then learn and you ought to incorporate the images of what the body scans show and then point out we're doing this because this is what's really happening to you.
[02:13:19.687 --> 02:13:25.010]  And if we're going to have to bear it in here, we're going to bear it out there, to show the public, to shock them.
[02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:27.371]  This is the kind of thing I'll make the government come after me, folks.
[02:13:27.371 --> 02:13:29.233]  This is really effective, peaceful stuff.
[02:13:29.233 --> 02:13:30.393]  This is what I'm really all about.
[02:13:30.393 --> 02:13:31.474]  We're taking a big risk doing this.
[02:13:31.474 --> 02:13:32.474]  I think you obviously know that.
[02:13:32.474 --> 02:13:33.875]  This is where the tip of the spear.
[02:13:33.875 --> 02:13:35.336]  We come up with these ideas.
[02:13:35.336 --> 02:13:40.259]  We came up with the idea to have the states and the cities swear to the Bill of Rights.
[02:13:40.259 --> 02:13:46.863]  Eight hundred plus cities, five states passed laws against the Patriot Act saying their police wouldn't comply with unconstitutional orders.
[02:13:47.583 --> 02:13:51.065]  That got picked up by everybody, that was very successful.
[02:13:51.065 --> 02:13:53.287]  I mean, how many things have we launched?
[02:13:53.287 --> 02:13:56.709]  The going to press conferences confronting politicians, we launched that.
[02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:59.971]  Code Pink, everybody yells, we are change, we've implemented it.
[02:13:59.971 --> 02:14:04.434]  We are change for good, Code Pink, more often than not, not for good.
[02:14:04.434 --> 02:14:06.755]  My wife had this idea.
[02:14:06.755 --> 02:14:08.276]  Why?
[02:14:08.276 --> 02:14:12.259]  My wife, only for a year, worked for PETA, very pretty.
[02:14:13.487 --> 02:14:22.811]  And she went to Tokyo and a few other places and just took her top off and it was the cover of hundreds of newspapers and magazines against killing whales.
[02:14:22.811 --> 02:14:24.972]  Okay?
[02:14:24.972 --> 02:14:26.953]  She painted herself up like a cheetah and everything.
[02:14:26.953 --> 02:14:30.094]  And went out there, fluted.
[02:14:30.094 --> 02:14:34.236]  She got arrested too in Japan, but they dropped the charges.
[02:14:34.236 --> 02:14:37.297]  Again, everywhere in the country it's legal and lawful.
[02:14:38.792 --> 02:14:45.133]  In Austin, they've had a bunch of court cases where women at protest have been naked, and what was it, 15 years ago, more?
[02:14:45.133 --> 02:14:51.215]  They lost the court case, so now women, you'll be on the hike and bike trail and they walk by naked, you know, as part of their feminism or whatever.
[02:14:51.215 --> 02:14:59.616]  The point is, this is, and we were on the Greenbelt the other day, I took Aaron and Rob for a five mile hike, little hike.
[02:14:59.616 --> 02:15:01.717]  This woman comes walking by with her top off.
[02:15:01.717 --> 02:15:06.338]  I mean, the point is, she wasn't very attractive, I'll tell you, but that's fine.
[02:15:06.338 --> 02:15:07.378]  I mean, the issue was,
[02:15:08.178 --> 02:15:10.340]  Is that, but this can't wait.
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:14.423]  So we're going to have a big protest date where everybody does it.
[02:15:14.423 --> 02:15:16.145]  I say we can't wait long.
[02:15:16.145 --> 02:15:19.067]  We'll set that out in about two weeks from now.
[02:15:19.067 --> 02:15:31.538]  Where everybody who wants to do it at the same date, federal courthouses, where they're implementing this tyranny, off the property of airports, on the side of the highway, at the entrances.
[02:15:31.538 --> 02:15:33.359]  $10,000 for the best video, that'll be judged in a month.
[02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:34.040]  But I wouldn't wait.
[02:15:35.529 --> 02:15:44.294]  And again, obviously the number of hits will be important, how effective it is, what you have to say.
[02:15:44.294 --> 02:15:46.416]  It needs to be ten minutes long or shorter.
[02:15:47.247 --> 02:15:48.227]  All right, I'm going to go to Alan Watt.
[02:15:48.227 --> 02:15:49.788]  We're going to do that.
[02:15:49.788 --> 02:15:52.229]  I'm talking to lawyers and other experts, looking at the U.S.
[02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:53.029]  Code.
[02:15:53.029 --> 02:15:54.450]  These are federal reservations.
[02:15:54.450 --> 02:15:56.871]  The airports have been illegally taken over by the feds.
[02:15:56.871 --> 02:15:57.931]  They're off their jurisdiction.
[02:15:57.931 --> 02:16:00.792]  They're now metastasizing out with the TSA teams.
[02:16:00.792 --> 02:16:03.853]  It's checkpoints all over the country, as we told you seven years ago they would do.
[02:16:03.853 --> 02:16:09.256]  Searching everyone from Dallas to New York, from Los Angeles to Miami.
[02:16:09.256 --> 02:16:11.336]  Wanding everyone, troops on the streets.
[02:16:11.336 --> 02:16:12.677]  I've got more articles today.
[02:16:14.712 --> 02:16:19.957]  We've got color scans of this up on InfoWars.com and here's the black and white color copy.
[02:16:19.957 --> 02:16:20.718]  Clear U.S.
[02:16:20.718 --> 02:16:25.202]  Army troops involved in house-to-house searches in Massachusetts.
[02:16:25.202 --> 02:16:26.163]  That's all going on.
[02:16:26.163 --> 02:16:35.372]  I mean, we're just being hit from every side, but these body scanners are the key with, like, these different psychological syndromes where people serve the abuser.
[02:16:38.851 --> 02:16:40.592]  The Stockholm Syndrome and others.
[02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:42.413]  We've got to stand up and say, you know what?
[02:16:42.413 --> 02:16:52.037]  We're going to use you trying to humiliate us naked to make us submit to you with these strip searches with these men looking at the women and children and men being scanned and laughing.
[02:16:52.037 --> 02:16:55.418]  All these photos of them smiling as the naked woman is in the scanner.
[02:16:55.418 --> 02:16:56.378]  This is a strip search.
[02:16:56.378 --> 02:16:57.999]  We've got to show the public that.
[02:16:57.999 --> 02:17:01.160]  Alan Watt, what do you think of my idea?
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:02.221]  My wife's idea.
[02:17:02.221 --> 02:17:06.503]  It's um... It could go either way actually.
[02:17:08.095 --> 02:17:14.160]  I was thinking of someone who did that over the last few years as a big art publicity stunt.
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:17.543]  Yeah, they do it in major cities from New York to Madrid.
[02:17:17.543 --> 02:17:18.143]  Yeah.
[02:17:18.143 --> 02:17:21.566]  And so, in a sense, it becomes almost acceptable.
[02:17:21.566 --> 02:17:28.592]  And we're also living in a culture that's been promoting this, again, from certain quarters for certain purposes.
[02:17:28.592 --> 02:17:33.836]  Well, Alan, I understand that the globalists at certain levels have been desensitizing, but this is using their own system against them.
[02:17:35.393 --> 02:17:40.558]  I think people should all turn up fully clothed and just put the protest out there.
[02:17:40.558 --> 02:17:42.880]  That's how I want it to stay.
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:47.905]  But personally, I don't want... The question to get pushed here is the fact that they're going to have... No, no, no, no.
[02:17:47.905 --> 02:17:50.107]  Alan, this is why I disagree with you and I rarely do.
[02:17:50.107 --> 02:17:53.630]  They're making you take your clothes off in the scanner.
[02:17:53.630 --> 02:17:57.153]  We are saying, look at what you want us to do.
[02:17:57.153 --> 02:17:59.976]  I think it's going to be devastating to them.
[02:18:00.598 --> 02:18:01.999]  I'll tell you what I would do.
[02:18:01.999 --> 02:18:03.780]  I'll tell you what I would do personally.
[02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:11.446]  I would just take photographs of all the mass graves of World War II and the Soviet Union.
[02:18:11.446 --> 02:18:17.511]  Of all the naked bodies and having placards of that and saying we're not going to end up like this.
[02:18:18.749 --> 02:18:19.349]  Exactly!
[02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:22.891]  Being unclothed, taking your shoes off, then all your clothes.
[02:18:22.891 --> 02:18:24.872]  It's a supplication.
[02:18:24.872 --> 02:18:29.134]  It's like herding people in to be shot in pits, stripping them down naked.
[02:18:29.134 --> 02:18:32.056]  Oh man, that's another great thought right there.
[02:18:32.056 --> 02:18:33.176]  That'd be a good poster.
[02:18:33.176 --> 02:18:37.659]  Dead bodies with the image of the naked woman from the scanner saying, we've seen this before.
[02:18:37.659 --> 02:18:38.679]  Don't airport scan.
[02:18:38.679 --> 02:18:39.580]  Go ahead.
[02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:42.641]  Yeah, because that's where you have to get in as to where this is going.
[02:18:42.641 --> 02:18:43.582]  It's not fun.
[02:18:43.582 --> 02:18:44.762]  It's not fun.
[02:18:44.762 --> 02:18:45.863]  It's degradation.
[02:18:45.863 --> 02:18:48.284]  It's dehumanization of the individual.
[02:18:49.065 --> 02:18:54.487]  And the people in general, human beings in general.
[02:18:54.487 --> 02:18:59.848]  Training us we have no dignity, no privacy, all the big government making us do it.
[02:18:59.848 --> 02:19:04.309]  Yes, and they've already said that they're going to keep these files forever.
[02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:12.371]  And they can also project how you're going to look in 10, 20, 30 years time according to all your profile and your genetic history and yadda yadda.
[02:19:12.371 --> 02:19:14.752]  And they'll be able to spot you wherever you are in the world.
[02:19:14.974 --> 02:19:16.635]  It's a biometric body scan.
[02:19:16.635 --> 02:19:18.096]  Absolutely, Alan.
[02:19:18.096 --> 02:19:22.939]  So really, what they're telling you is not only do you not own your body, you own nothing.
[02:19:22.939 --> 02:19:25.461]  You don't even own the patents to your own genes.
[02:19:25.461 --> 02:19:27.942]  They're telling you you're a piece of property.
[02:19:27.942 --> 02:19:30.384]  And they're telling us that they take all our babies' blood at birth.
[02:19:30.384 --> 02:19:31.505]  That's now admitted.
[02:19:31.505 --> 02:19:35.727]  Oh yes, and Australia came out through the fact that they've been doing it for 30 years.
[02:19:35.727 --> 02:19:37.909]  One of the listeners went to get it back from them.
[02:19:37.909 --> 02:19:40.490]  They have them stored up in certain quarters.
[02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:42.272]  He wasn't allowed to get a hold of it.
[02:19:43.317 --> 02:19:46.280]  Globally implemented 37 years ago.
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:48.001]  Yep.
[02:19:48.001 --> 02:19:48.802]  Absolutely, Alan.
[02:19:48.802 --> 02:19:49.142]  Stay there.
[02:19:49.142 --> 02:19:53.046]  Let's go over the body scanners, the humiliation a lot more, and we want more ideas.
[02:19:53.046 --> 02:19:54.687]  You know, everybody take action.
[02:19:54.687 --> 02:20:01.654]  We're going to expose the naked body scanners, shocking the public into seeing how much we're being made to reveal.
[02:20:03.905 --> 02:20:05.787]  How would you feel with normal blood pressure?
[02:20:05.787 --> 02:20:09.030]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:10.912]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[02:20:10.912 --> 02:20:13.254]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[02:20:13.254 --> 02:20:14.976]  To have a sex life again?
[02:20:14.976 --> 02:20:20.361]  All these benefits and more can be yours when your body heals itself with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:20:20.361 --> 02:20:22.242]  But please, don't take our word for it.

[02:21:03.922 --> 02:21:11.665]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:21:11.665 --> 02:21:17.748]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:21:17.748 --> 02:21:20.369]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.

[02:21:36.681 --> 02:21:38.742]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:21:38.742 --> 02:21:40.502]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:21:40.502 --> 02:21:43.023]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:21:43.023 --> 02:21:47.765]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:21:47.765 --> 02:21:51.466]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.

[02:21:54.587 --> 02:21:56.488]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:21:56.488 --> 02:21:58.609]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:22:03.612 --> 02:22:05.853]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:05.853 --> 02:22:07.614]  January 6th, 2010.
[02:22:07.614 --> 02:22:08.935]  Gold open this morning at $11.2670.
[02:22:08.935 --> 02:22:13.137]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.5739, $5.7870 for a half ounce, or $2.8935 for the quarter ounce.
[02:22:13.137 --> 02:22:13.718]  That's $11.5739, $5.7870, and $2.8935.
[02:22:23.644 --> 02:22:37.274]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:22:37.274 --> 02:22:38.515]  Is this capitalism?
[02:22:38.515 --> 02:22:45.861]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:46.101 --> 02:22:47.202]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:47.202 --> 02:22:51.547]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[02:22:51.547 --> 02:22:52.508]  Call for your copy.
[02:22:52.508 --> 02:22:52.649]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.649 --> 02:22:53.910]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:54.290]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:54.731]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:03.641 --> 02:23:07.203]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:23:07.203 --> 02:23:09.484]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:23:09.484 --> 02:23:10.365]  Don't!
[02:23:10.365 --> 02:23:13.807]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:23:13.807 --> 02:23:20.931]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:23:20.911 --> 02:23:22.892]  's number one debt secret.
[02:23:22.892 --> 02:23:26.554]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:23:26.954 --> 02:23:30.096]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:23:30.096 --> 02:23:37.482]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:23:37.482 --> 02:23:38.662]  Herb K was right.
[02:23:38.662 --> 02:23:41.845]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:23:41.845 --> 02:23:43.206]  What have you got to lose?
[02:23:43.206 --> 02:23:46.908]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:23:46.908 --> 02:23:50.851]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:23:50.851 --> 02:23:51.211]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:23:55.294 --> 02:23:55.794]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:23:55.794 --> 02:23:55.855]  888-352-7726.
[02:23:55.855 --> 02:24:01.158]  There's an article up on PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson with a headline, Breaking the Will of the People.
[02:24:18.612 --> 02:24:26.858]  The real purpose of body scanners, and you scroll down, it shows the Nazis and others strip-searching women in World War II.
[02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:28.939]  And that's what this is really all about.
[02:24:28.939 --> 02:24:33.802]  Going back to Alan Watt, great idea pointing out that they always strip you down before they kill you.
[02:24:33.802 --> 02:24:35.804]  I mean, it's a real act of submission.
[02:24:35.804 --> 02:24:43.369]  Do you agree with me that this, telling everyone you will be naked body scanned, is a key point in our conditioning and we must resist it?
[02:24:43.971 --> 02:24:45.492]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[02:24:45.492 --> 02:24:53.097]  It's a definite one, because Blair was talking about this long before this happened, this latest farcical incident.
[02:24:53.097 --> 02:25:04.305]  And it's an ongoing process of depersonalization, dehumanization, and getting the public to accept the fact that they're nothing but cattle, literally nothing but cattle.
[02:25:04.305 --> 02:25:08.468]  And you feel small, you start to obey and submit.
[02:25:08.468 --> 02:25:11.450]  Submission is what they're after for what's coming after this.
[02:25:12.682 --> 02:25:18.324]  But if I was going to have a demonstration, I'd also have them wear those fake tattoos on their forearms as well.
[02:25:18.324 --> 02:25:20.886]  Or barcodes, and all the rest of it as well.
[02:25:20.886 --> 02:25:27.528]  Just to prove a point, this was all done before, and this is where it ends up, in these pits of bulldozers pushing bodies into pits.
[02:25:27.528 --> 02:25:28.249]  That's what I'd say.
[02:25:30.782 --> 02:25:31.822]  That's a great idea.
[02:25:31.822 --> 02:25:37.184]  Hand out images of the women in the naked body scanners with barcodes on their heads.
[02:25:37.184 --> 02:25:38.105]  Add that.
[02:25:38.105 --> 02:25:45.027]  Or women and men can put barcodes on their heads, on their bodies, paint themselves with barcodes as some type of covering.
[02:25:45.027 --> 02:25:47.588]  Now that's another excellent idea, Alan.
[02:25:47.588 --> 02:25:51.450]  Of course, what comes next here is medicalizing all this.
[02:25:51.450 --> 02:25:53.891]  Taking blood and urine at the checkpoints.
[02:25:53.891 --> 02:25:55.731]  That's already happening under federal grants.
[02:25:55.731 --> 02:25:57.832]  Warrantless taking of blood.
[02:25:57.832 --> 02:25:59.593]  They're also implementing
[02:26:00.273 --> 02:26:08.235]  Well, they decided a long time ago that a stage would come where they'd have to gradually eradicate most of humanity so that a million people could live in high luxury.
[02:26:08.235 --> 02:26:11.296]  That's a statement still put out by the United Nations today.
[02:26:27.441 --> 02:26:37.786]  They say that we can either live as 7 or 8 billion peasants in a low state of living, or 1 million people can live in a high state.
[02:26:37.786 --> 02:26:49.411]  So they're bringing us down through sterilization, through the total destruction of the family, they don't have children, and it's an ongoing, long-term project, but in the meantime, they must further dehumiliate us.
[02:26:51.878 --> 02:26:52.819]  And modesty!
[02:26:52.819 --> 02:26:53.219]  And modesty!
[02:26:53.219 --> 02:26:56.681]  Everybody knows the most evil governments strip you.
[02:26:56.681 --> 02:27:00.304]  What do they do when you first come into a prison?
[02:27:00.304 --> 02:27:03.246]  They strip you and do a medical exam to humiliate you?
[02:27:23.447 --> 02:27:29.171]  They hold you down in front of other prisoners and they laugh at you, make jokes about you, and that's all part of it.
[02:27:29.171 --> 02:27:32.654]  So do you humiliate the people?
[02:27:32.654 --> 02:27:44.342]  And when they arrested the protesters and my camera guy, they tortured Luke Radowski and others, made fun of them when they went to the bathroom, strung them up naked, and had troops there running it.
[02:27:44.342 --> 02:27:45.063]  Yes.
[02:27:45.063 --> 02:27:46.283]  Oh yeah.
[02:27:46.283 --> 02:27:49.566]  And they joke away and laugh away, whether you're male or female.
[02:27:49.566 --> 02:27:52.228]  And of course that's really dehumanizing the soldiers as well.
[02:27:52.904 --> 02:27:53.565]  It does.
[02:27:53.565 --> 02:27:54.906]  It actually brutalises them.
[02:27:54.906 --> 02:27:58.769]  It teaches them to be more brutal because it's an odd thing that happens.
[02:27:58.769 --> 02:28:06.255]  It's been tested many times with different experiments that they get into their roles.
[02:28:06.255 --> 02:28:11.580]  They begin to despise the meek and humble, grovelling prisoners and they become brutal.
[02:28:11.580 --> 02:28:12.981]  It's a standard fare.
[02:28:15.885 --> 02:28:21.450]  Then they have their project, Hostile Intent, with their face scanning your facial expression saying, oh, you were frowning.
[02:28:21.450 --> 02:28:23.671]  That's my probable cause that you're a terrorist.
[02:28:23.671 --> 02:28:24.272]  Exactly.
[02:28:24.272 --> 02:28:26.514]  In fact, they don't like any possible comeback.
[02:28:26.514 --> 02:28:29.116]  They take it personally when you look them in the eye.
[02:28:29.116 --> 02:28:33.419]  And they actually teach special forces what to do when you're in prison.
[02:28:33.419 --> 02:28:36.702]  Be humble, always look at the floor, never look in the eye.
[02:28:36.702 --> 02:28:41.726]  And remember 1984 when Winston said you had to watch the look on your face?
[02:28:41.726 --> 02:28:42.327]  We're now here.
[02:28:42.327 --> 02:28:43.588]  Yeah, this is an old technique.
[02:28:44.535 --> 02:28:48.677]  Even with the movie, a very good movie, it's called The Madness of King George.
[02:28:48.677 --> 02:28:49.777]  King George was mad.
[02:28:49.777 --> 02:28:52.718]  He had manic-depressive bouts.
[02:28:52.718 --> 02:28:53.559]  Look at Bilderberg!
[02:28:53.559 --> 02:28:55.079]  They're not allowed to look at him in the face there.
[02:28:55.079 --> 02:28:55.760]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:56.700]  King George.
[02:28:56.700 --> 02:28:59.101]  Back then, people realized that it was a crime.
[02:28:59.101 --> 02:29:02.282]  It was a crime to look the king in the eye.
[02:29:02.282 --> 02:29:02.883]  An absolute crime.
[02:29:02.883 --> 02:29:04.783]  You were locked up in prison for it.
[02:29:04.783 --> 02:29:06.824]  And that was in the 1800s.
[02:29:06.824 --> 02:29:10.246]  And right up into the 1900s, you were not allowed to look him in the eye.
[02:29:10.246 --> 02:29:13.187]  Hillary Clinton did the same thing when she was in the White House.
[02:29:14.005 --> 02:29:15.526]  None of the staff could look her in the eye.
[02:29:15.526 --> 02:29:17.567]  It was a major offence.
[02:29:17.567 --> 02:29:27.152]  And this is the standard technique of the psychopath at the top, who's utterly brutal and wants total subservience from all the meek and humble beneath him.
[02:29:27.152 --> 02:29:31.814]  And the more you comply and be meek and humble, the more they despise you for being so weak.
[02:29:32.915 --> 02:29:37.296]  And then that legitimizes their abuse of you in their sadomasochistic minds.
[02:29:37.296 --> 02:29:40.537]  And notice all the torture in Iraq and the secret bases in Europe.
[02:29:40.537 --> 02:29:42.838]  It's all sexual that's been declassified.
[02:29:42.838 --> 02:29:48.600]  Raping children, using battery acid, Jeffrey Dahmer hellraiser stuff is now good.
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:54.562]  The psychopaths are turning the whole world's psychological atmosphere into hell.
[02:29:54.562 --> 02:29:55.962]  We're on the march.
[02:29:55.962 --> 02:29:58.503]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:58.503 --> 02:30:01.164]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.629 --> 02:30:07.731]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:30:07.731 --> 02:30:10.593]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:10.593 --> 02:30:11.873]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:11.873 --> 02:30:12.694]  It's very real.
[02:30:12.694 --> 02:30:14.935]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:30:14.935 --> 02:30:16.596]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:30:16.596 --> 02:30:21.058]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:30:21.058 --> 02:30:23.640]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[02:30:34.424 --> 02:30:37.265]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:30:37.265 --> 02:30:39.986]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:39.986 --> 02:30:47.149]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:51.430]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:51.430 --> 02:30:53.351]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:31:03.334 --> 02:31:07.895]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:07.895 --> 02:31:08.795]  Number one.
[02:31:08.795 --> 02:31:12.216]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:12.216 --> 02:31:13.076]  Number two.
[02:31:13.076 --> 02:31:17.977]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:17.977 --> 02:31:18.717]  It's true.
[02:31:18.717 --> 02:31:23.578]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:23.578 --> 02:31:24.418]  Number three.
[02:31:24.418 --> 02:31:27.999]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:27.999 --> 02:31:31.700]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:32.701]  Number 4.
[02:31:32.701 --> 02:31:35.463]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:35.463 --> 02:31:39.147]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:39.147 --> 02:31:39.948]  Number 5.
[02:31:39.948 --> 02:31:44.091]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:44.091 --> 02:31:48.856]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:49.136 --> 02:31:53.300]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:55.102]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:55.102 --> 02:31:57.344]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:57.344 --> 02:31:59.686]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:03.834 --> 02:32:06.856]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:06.856 --> 02:32:12.178]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:12.178 --> 02:32:14.219]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:14.219 --> 02:32:19.222]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:19.222 --> 02:32:20.403]  How much do you want?
[02:32:20.403 --> 02:32:21.543]  When do you want it?
[02:32:21.543 --> 02:32:23.424]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:32:23.424 --> 02:32:24.485]  When will you need it?
[02:32:24.485 --> 02:32:26.706]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:32:26.706 --> 02:32:28.047]  Will there be any food?
[02:32:28.047 --> 02:32:29.567]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:32:29.567 --> 02:32:30.608]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:32:30.768 --> 02:32:32.089]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:32:32.089 --> 02:32:34.812]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:38.416]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:32:38.416 --> 02:32:42.220]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:43.462]  How much will you need?
[02:32:43.462 --> 02:32:44.363]  We don't know.
[02:32:44.363 --> 02:32:45.464]  How much do you want?
[02:32:45.464 --> 02:32:46.405]  All you can get.
[02:32:46.405 --> 02:32:47.206]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:47.486 --> 02:32:50.528]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:50.528 --> 02:32:53.669]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:53.669 --> 02:32:54.950]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:55.890]  Get up, stand up.
[02:32:55.890 --> 02:32:57.171]  Stand up for your right.
[02:33:18.138 --> 02:33:32.430]  In the next few days, we'll post all the details at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:32.430 --> 02:33:34.472]  Three new contests.
[02:33:42.909 --> 02:33:45.617]  $10,000 for the best protest video and it can be whatever you want.
[02:33:49.967 --> 02:33:56.849]  I think that the topless thing, bare minimum, because the public doesn't fully understand, you are naked being recorded.
[02:33:56.849 --> 02:33:59.629]  I think it's going to devastate them to use their own tools against them.
[02:33:59.629 --> 02:34:02.610]  Because that's an act that you willfully do instead of them forcing you.
[02:34:02.610 --> 02:34:06.631]  You are taking that like judo and using it against them.
[02:34:06.631 --> 02:34:12.492]  $5,000 for the best poster against airport scanning and whoever puts up the most and does the best job.
[02:34:12.492 --> 02:34:13.892]  Okay?
[02:34:13.892 --> 02:34:15.392]  You will win $5,000.
[02:34:15.392 --> 02:34:17.273]  And then what was the other one I came up with?
[02:34:18.821 --> 02:34:20.802]  It was another $5,000 for something?
[02:34:20.802 --> 02:34:21.683]  I'll have to go back and listen.
[02:34:21.683 --> 02:34:24.324]  I was spontaneously thinking of that on air.
[02:34:24.324 --> 02:34:28.927]  I said $5,000 for something else?
[02:34:28.927 --> 02:34:33.709]  There was another form of protest that I said was another $5,000?
[02:34:33.709 --> 02:34:35.650]  I'm gonna have to go listen to that.
[02:34:35.650 --> 02:34:36.891]  Did we write notes on that?
[02:34:36.891 --> 02:34:39.752]  My third?
[02:34:39.752 --> 02:34:40.653]  No.
[02:34:40.653 --> 02:34:41.073]  No.
[02:34:41.073 --> 02:34:43.194]  There's three contests.
[02:34:43.194 --> 02:34:45.515]  $10,000 for the protest.
[02:34:45.515 --> 02:34:46.096]  Best video.
[02:34:48.108 --> 02:34:51.390]  Preferably topless.
[02:34:51.390 --> 02:34:53.051]  Oh, $5,000 for the best political stunt.
[02:34:53.051 --> 02:34:53.872]  That's right.
[02:34:53.872 --> 02:34:56.013]  Good job, dude.
[02:34:56.013 --> 02:34:59.715]  $5,000 for the best political stunt.
[02:34:59.715 --> 02:35:00.976]  Legal banner hangs.
[02:35:00.976 --> 02:35:03.938]  Of course, he'll selectively enforce that.
[02:35:03.938 --> 02:35:04.719]  Events.
[02:35:04.719 --> 02:35:06.920]  Stuff on TV.
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:07.780]  Whatever you can do.
[02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:11.703]  Best stunt that you videotape and post to YouTube.
[02:35:11.703 --> 02:35:13.264]  Best legal stunt.
[02:35:15.495 --> 02:35:27.759]  I mean, that could be in your county where it's legal, putting on a $5,000 free fireworks contest and getting people there and handing out to 5,000 people body scanners and telling them, let's go protest next week.
[02:35:27.759 --> 02:35:31.561]  I don't know what the stunts are.
[02:35:31.561 --> 02:35:33.762]  I mean, let's see what you come up with.
[02:35:33.762 --> 02:35:36.363]  That's $20,000 in prize money.
[02:35:36.363 --> 02:35:37.083]  How do I pay for that?
[02:35:38.254 --> 02:35:41.380]  You, the listeners, purchased the books and videos from Infowars.com.
[02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:43.303]  We've slashed all the prices because of the economy.
[02:35:43.303 --> 02:35:45.347]  My mission is to get the materials out.
[02:35:46.391 --> 02:35:50.214]  When you get Fall of the Republic for $19.95, my latest and most powerful film.
[02:35:50.214 --> 02:35:52.896]  It's got Alan Watt in it, Max Keiser.
[02:35:52.896 --> 02:35:55.278]  It's got Webster Tarbley.
[02:35:55.278 --> 02:35:59.961]  It's got Economist in there, of course, George Humphrey.
[02:35:59.961 --> 02:36:02.363]  It's got Gerald Cilente.
[02:36:02.363 --> 02:36:04.185]  The list just goes on and on.
[02:36:04.185 --> 02:36:06.767]  Myself in the film, it just documents their whole agenda.
[02:36:06.767 --> 02:36:08.408]  And we're having victories against them.
[02:36:08.408 --> 02:36:11.570]  They're not invincible because we know their game plan.
[02:36:11.570 --> 02:36:13.132]  Get a free t-shirt of your choice.
[02:36:14.474 --> 02:36:15.294]  Or get a free video.
[02:36:15.294 --> 02:36:19.456]  We have a bunch of special combo deals right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:19.456 --> 02:36:22.898]  And when you purchase books and videos, you support what we're doing.
[02:36:22.898 --> 02:36:24.719]  We're not funded by George Soros.
[02:36:24.719 --> 02:36:28.060]  We're not funded by the government like all these globalists, right-wing, left-wing groups.
[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:30.421]  We are patriots standing up.
[02:36:30.421 --> 02:36:34.863]  And the globalists hate the example we've made of leadership and strength and honor.
[02:36:34.863 --> 02:36:36.784]  They don't want you to know that you have power.
[02:36:36.784 --> 02:36:38.605]  They don't want you to know you can stand up.
[02:36:38.605 --> 02:36:40.226]  They want to make you hopeless.
[02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:43.572]  But we're standing up and showing people the power of the people.
[02:36:43.572 --> 02:36:44.773]  Look what happened in Copenhagen.
[02:36:44.773 --> 02:36:45.633]  That was annihilated.
[02:36:45.633 --> 02:36:47.595]  We'll get Alan Watts' take on that.
[02:36:47.595 --> 02:36:48.715]  Infowars.com.
[02:36:48.715 --> 02:36:52.037]  Take advantage of the deals, the free videos and t-shirts, or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:52.037 --> 02:36:53.698]  You can also write to me at P.O.
[02:36:53.698 --> 02:36:54.378]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:36:54.378 --> 02:36:54.879]  That's P.O.
[02:36:54.879 --> 02:36:55.979]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:37:06.605 --> 02:37:12.086]  And five plus months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv until next Friday and then that deal is gone until next year.
[02:37:12.086 --> 02:37:14.247]  The New Year's Special, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:14.247 --> 02:37:15.767]  Okay, Alan, I'm gonna try to shut up now.
[02:37:15.767 --> 02:37:26.230]  I'm just so wound up about what's happening because I have never let my family, my children have never flown because I won't have them strip searched or beat up or they're always killing people in the TSA and I won't...
[02:37:26.730 --> 02:37:36.980]  I can't watch them humiliated, taking their shoes off and being indoctrinated to be slaves for the next phase of being naked body scanned, and they use the instrumentality of a machine like that makes it okay.
[02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:41.424]  Be like instead of a cop shooting you in the head, he had a robot shoot you in the head, so it's okay.
[02:37:41.424 --> 02:37:43.946]  It's men looking at a screen of your naked body and saving it.
[02:37:43.946 --> 02:37:45.227]  It's even worse than a strip search.
[02:37:45.227 --> 02:37:48.050]  It'd be like if they led you in and stripped you and videotaped it and laughed at you.
[02:37:49.406 --> 02:37:50.506]  How do we beat this?
[02:37:50.506 --> 02:37:51.386]  How do we resist it?
[02:37:51.386 --> 02:37:58.848]  How do we not just contribute to the Stockholm Syndrome of covering all of this and then people just get hopeless?
[02:37:58.848 --> 02:38:00.168]  How do we fight back?
[02:38:00.168 --> 02:38:01.388]  How do we defeat these people?
[02:38:01.388 --> 02:38:10.610]  Then I want to get into how worldwide, from Germany to New York State, they're arresting homeschooling parents for no reason in big public raids, trumping up fake charges.
[02:38:10.610 --> 02:38:14.271]  I'm going to give the number out to that county coming up, folks, for people to call later.
[02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:18.931]  They are moving on us on every front.
[02:38:18.931 --> 02:38:25.294]  Copenhagen was mainly a defeat, but Gordon Brown said, I don't care if you didn't sign on, we're still going to implement it.
[02:38:25.294 --> 02:38:26.954]  Alan, what?
[02:38:26.954 --> 02:38:28.195]  Yes.
[02:38:28.195 --> 02:38:32.337]  Again, people have to realize that they're not a nobody.
[02:38:32.337 --> 02:38:33.757]  No one is a nobody.
[02:38:33.757 --> 02:38:39.540]  And that's been the technique that's been used for so long is to make us all think we're nobodies.
[02:38:39.540 --> 02:38:45.963]  And that special people that come out of special wombs are up there to guide you and to manage your life for you.
[02:38:46.764 --> 02:38:51.065]  We have been taught since the 60s onwards to be children, perpetual children.
[02:38:51.065 --> 02:38:55.767]  Don't get involved in politics, ignore it, just have a good time and play.
[02:38:55.767 --> 02:39:02.709]  And now it's all called coming home because you have people now who are at that stage of mentality but have never matured.
[02:39:02.709 --> 02:39:05.010]  A lot of people out there have never matured.
[02:39:05.010 --> 02:39:11.032]  They're living now as they did when they were 18 years of age, even if they're 40.
[02:39:11.032 --> 02:39:15.173]  So we're aiming at the people who can still think, who still have a sense of self-respect,
[02:39:15.954 --> 02:39:19.558]  And know how to give it back to people who have lost it along the way.
[02:39:19.558 --> 02:39:21.800]  Their own self-respect.
[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:25.364]  Government exists by the will of the people.
[02:39:25.364 --> 02:39:27.125]  Government is only an idea.
[02:39:27.125 --> 02:39:29.608]  That's all it is.
[02:39:29.608 --> 02:39:30.649]  And it only gets away with it.
[02:39:30.649 --> 02:39:31.310]  It's like money.
[02:39:31.310 --> 02:39:35.594]  If you have faith that that money works and someone will accept it, then things will work.
[02:39:36.594 --> 02:39:39.837]  If you have faith in the government, it will work.
[02:39:39.837 --> 02:39:45.402]  But if you give complete faith in the government, it will work in its own way and not for your benefit.
[02:39:45.402 --> 02:39:49.126]  However, it still only exists because you allow it to exist.
[02:39:49.944 --> 02:39:52.505]  And that's got to get pushed home to these boys at the top.
[02:39:52.505 --> 02:39:53.265]  They know this, too.
[02:39:53.265 --> 02:39:56.926]  They're preparing for all kinds of possible scenarios.
[02:39:56.926 --> 02:40:04.348]  They've thought through the whole next 50 years agenda and they're preparing for all possible outcomes.
[02:40:04.348 --> 02:40:17.132]  But what they don't want is a passive, yet such an aggressive push and mass demonstrations for people to take back their rights and to put the government back in its place.
[02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:27.137]  Every government in the world has got to start putting down on its books the recall of people who do not fulfill their promises in elections.
[02:40:27.137 --> 02:40:31.320]  When they go off on some strange tangent as soon as they're in office, they should be out the door
[02:40:33.047 --> 02:40:38.551]  Instead of in England, the left and right, the US left and right, most people are still caught up.
[02:40:38.551 --> 02:40:39.992]  They hate the party that's in power.
[02:40:39.992 --> 02:40:41.433]  They vote for the party out of power.
[02:40:41.433 --> 02:40:42.373]  Then they hate that party.
[02:40:42.373 --> 02:40:43.734]  They vote for the next party.
[02:40:43.734 --> 02:40:44.855]  It's all staged.
[02:40:44.855 --> 02:40:50.899]  We have to have a paradigm shift and stop looking at the low-level puppets and see the real architecture of enslavement.
[02:40:50.899 --> 02:40:56.123]  Yes, and we've got to get the big foundations and the CFR
[02:40:57.356 --> 02:41:01.499]  The Royal Institute of International Affairs is totally out of politics.
[02:41:01.499 --> 02:41:15.968]  In fact, they should be outlawed, to be honest with you, because they've been behind the last 100 years of guiding this whole world and every country in it into this mandated global society of a socialist type formula.
[02:41:16.799 --> 02:41:17.860]  We're good to go.
[02:41:36.383 --> 02:41:42.050]  And they are parasites, and they love the fact that they're in the process of disarming us, as is happening in Canada right now.
[02:41:42.050 --> 02:41:48.539]  Alan, you talk a lot about how they, and this is in their own documents, again, Charlotte Isabeau's books full of the documents,
[02:41:50.259 --> 02:41:58.941]  About how they're turning man against woman, woman against man, black against white, Muslim against Jew, Catholic against Protestant, Northerner against Southerner.
[02:41:58.941 --> 02:42:01.182]  Always balkanizing everyone.
[02:42:01.182 --> 02:42:05.143]  Here's an article, and give me a document Cam, shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:42:05.143 --> 02:42:07.804]  France decriminalized shouting at your wife.
[02:42:07.804 --> 02:42:14.866]  Married couples could be arrested and charged for insulting each other under a new law in France banning psychological violence.
[02:42:14.866 --> 02:42:19.207]  And in the US, they're starting to take people's kids if they're seen yelling at them, even if it isn't against the law.
[02:42:20.473 --> 02:42:28.560]  And then it says right here that it's going to be implemented with a ticket the first time, and then jail time, and then huge fines.
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:32.563]  And it says that they're encouraging men and women to tattle on each other.
[02:42:32.563 --> 02:42:35.405]  And women are being taught, your husband's arguing with you?
[02:42:35.405 --> 02:42:36.125]  Call the police.
[02:42:37.049 --> 02:42:41.852]  And so again, they are literally moving forward with this agenda.
[02:42:41.852 --> 02:42:43.213]  I wanted to read one part.
[02:42:43.213 --> 02:42:53.838]  Police are being urged to issue a caution in the first instance of a reported crime of raising their voice, but repeated offenses could face a fine or electronic tagging or jail.
[02:42:53.838 --> 02:42:58.321]  See, all these petty things that aren't even crimes, everybody's got to be tagged.
[02:43:01.496 --> 02:43:05.659]  Yeah, well, I tell you, people have to stop being politically correct.
[02:43:05.659 --> 02:43:13.765]  This is all training people to be politically correct, and they keep updating it off, because they know where they're going with it all, into a robotic society.
[02:43:13.765 --> 02:43:20.230]  But it's also to make sure that you cannot live outside the government's control.
[02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:24.834]  In other words, if you're going to have an argument, you must have a professional counsellor there to have it.
[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:39.184]  Well now they're saying out of 60 million or 50 million French, whatever it is, pull up the population number of France, they're saying 157 French men and women killed each other in 2008 and we can't allow that.
[02:43:39.184 --> 02:43:53.609]  Like one underwear bomber, all our rights leave, they naked scan us and now we may have to ban marriage and make everybody live in dormitories because every once in a while people kill each other and oh my gosh sometimes parents abuse babies so 20,000 homes in England now
[02:43:55.129 --> 02:44:00.174]  At birth, cameras go in your home until the kids leave when they're 18, and the government watches you!
[02:44:00.174 --> 02:44:01.015]  That's right.
[02:44:01.015 --> 02:44:01.496]  See?
[02:44:01.496 --> 02:44:05.500]  Oh, well, my God, sometimes people fight, so we've just got to ban this institution!
[02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:07.322]  They're actually talking about it!
[02:44:07.322 --> 02:44:09.484]  It was back in the 1960s.
[02:44:09.484 --> 02:44:18.213]  An American psychological association's own magazine, they said that in the 60s, eventually, they will put cameras in every citizen's homes.
[02:44:19.316 --> 02:44:28.921]  And it will pick up any signs of aggression, such as your mouth going down, the eyes narrowing, and they will have an intervention team.
[02:44:28.921 --> 02:44:31.562]  They'll come in straight away before anything happens.
[02:44:31.562 --> 02:44:34.964]  Now, we've got to understand, we're simply following through a script here.
[02:44:34.964 --> 02:44:37.865]  It's an intergenerational script.
[02:44:37.865 --> 02:44:40.347]  It's updated for each generation.
[02:44:40.347 --> 02:44:42.648]  And it's not happening by the moment.
[02:44:42.648 --> 02:44:46.810]  It happens with some strange new idea that came out of Parliament or Congress.
[02:44:47.418 --> 02:44:51.071]  It was implemented and written into UN various constitutions 40, 50, 60...
[02:44:54.031 --> 02:44:56.132]  And now they're announcing their world government.
[02:44:56.132 --> 02:44:59.134]  By the way, France has 61.5 million people.
[02:44:59.134 --> 02:45:08.720]  And now, Ellen, why are they now coming right out and saying, Von Ruppe, the head of the EU, Gore, Gordon Brown, they're all saying global governance is here.
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:21.228]  They announced at the conference, yes, we want it to be a global one-child policy, yes, we want to shut down the money so you can't afford to have children, and then we'll CPS them if you're poor, and yes,
[02:45:23.169 --> 02:45:28.773]  This is really all about population reduction, and now Austin has announced the city.
[02:45:28.773 --> 02:45:30.814]  Yes, we don't want to build new roads.
[02:45:30.814 --> 02:45:32.795]  We're going to force you to take buses.
[02:45:32.795 --> 02:45:34.396]  We are your social engineers.
[02:45:34.396 --> 02:45:37.098]  We own your butt.
[02:45:37.098 --> 02:45:37.779]  Yeah.
[02:45:37.779 --> 02:45:39.160]  Again, a very old agenda.
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:50.187]  They were written years ago of how they would do this in fact, and how they would implement it by stages as they gradually altered the perceptions of each generation.
[02:45:50.580 --> 02:45:52.082]  So why are they now announcing it?
[02:45:52.082 --> 02:45:53.463]  Why are they getting so bold?
[02:45:53.463 --> 02:45:56.166]  Why is everything moving ten times faster?
[02:45:56.166 --> 02:45:58.188]  They really believe now it's time.
[02:45:58.188 --> 02:46:00.030]  They believe now it's time.
[02:46:00.030 --> 02:46:07.157]  See, a long time ago they said that 2012 was when the UN would come up to its full power and be accepted by the world.
[02:46:07.157 --> 02:46:12.123]  They think it's now ready to be accepted by the various populaces of the world.
[02:46:13.959 --> 02:46:14.959]  They're almost right.
[02:46:14.959 --> 02:46:18.721]  Most countries will go along because they're so beaten down by everything.
[02:46:18.721 --> 02:46:20.782]  They probably will just go along with it.
[02:46:20.782 --> 02:46:22.082]  In fact, they'll think, what can we do?
[02:46:22.082 --> 02:46:25.003]  We haven't protested anything for years.
[02:46:25.003 --> 02:46:28.865]  Most countries have not protested anything for years.
[02:46:28.865 --> 02:46:32.606]  And so they've been trained to comply and comply and comply.
[02:46:32.606 --> 02:46:36.128]  So at the top, they do believe they're ready to accept
[02:46:37.617 --> 02:46:57.653]  You're right, and Alan, now suddenly, as you know, on CNN, Fox, they're going, the Japanese are looking at putting lithium in the water, an anti-psychotic, and the lady on the show says, I think it's a good idea, and suddenly they're going, yeah, we are going to put statins in the water in Prozac, and yeah, Prozac is in water supplies that don't have runoff that it shouldn't be.
[02:46:57.653 --> 02:46:59.935]  Yes, it's going to make you feel better, they're just
[02:47:00.515 --> 02:47:04.596]  They're just titrating the dose, for those that don't know, to get used to, say, cobra bites.
[02:47:04.596 --> 02:47:07.537]  They give people small amounts of the venom and build it up.
[02:47:07.537 --> 02:47:10.098]  And I believe that's why they let Ventura have the TV show.
[02:47:10.098 --> 02:47:11.598]  He means well, I mean well.
[02:47:11.598 --> 02:47:13.859]  But they believe it's now time to throw it in your face.
[02:47:13.859 --> 02:47:17.580]  That's why they're not too worried about me, because they believe it's now time to throw it in your face.
[02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:24.062]  I just want to ask the controllers and the bureaucrats that get petty power out of this, who are compartmentalized, do you like giving your kids
[02:47:24.522 --> 02:47:29.624]  Tap water, in some cases over 300 deadly chemicals, but on average 150 plus.
[02:47:29.624 --> 02:47:35.127]  Do you like the fact that your boys are effeminate, and a lot of them don't even have a sperm count by the time they're 20?
[02:47:35.127 --> 02:47:37.227]  Do you like the fact that everybody's dying of cancer?
[02:47:37.227 --> 02:47:38.568]  I mean, do you really like this?
[02:47:38.568 --> 02:47:40.469]  But see, it's a psychological trick.
[02:47:40.469 --> 02:47:44.511]  They get off on the fact that they feel like they're part of it.
[02:47:44.511 --> 02:47:46.952]  And also, most people go into denial.
[02:47:46.952 --> 02:47:47.792]  They cannot believe.
[02:47:48.601 --> 02:47:54.624]  That the masters above them would be so bad as to actually do this deliberately.
[02:47:54.624 --> 02:47:59.727]  In fact, the masters count on the public saying, well, they're always screwing up.
[02:47:59.727 --> 02:48:01.208]  It's got to be a mistake.
[02:48:01.208 --> 02:48:03.570]  They wouldn't have meant to do that.
[02:48:03.570 --> 02:48:16.657]  And of course, they did mean to do that because Julian Huxley said in the 1950s, and he was the first CEO of UNESCO, he said, we shall use all kinds of pharma in drinking water, food and inoculations.
[02:48:17.466 --> 02:48:19.411]  You've created a compliant fireball.
[02:48:20.538 --> 02:48:39.424]  At an endgame 1.5, we have Dr. Michael Kaufman reading from official Pentagon sanctioned studies of what they would do by the year 2000 from the 60s, and these are major universities saying, we will hype the sports up for everybody, we will start drugging everyone with the Soma-type drugs we're developing.
[02:48:39.424 --> 02:48:48.426]  They said we will then start breaking up the families, and everyone will be literally like childlike people, and then we can start reducing their numbers.
[02:48:48.426 --> 02:48:49.647]  So they're just getting everyone ready.
[02:48:50.487 --> 02:48:52.787]  To where, oh yeah, everybody on the block's dying of cancer.
[02:48:52.787 --> 02:48:53.888]  Well, I guess I'm dying.
[02:48:53.888 --> 02:48:55.308]  I love the government.
[02:48:55.308 --> 02:48:58.669]  And the newscasters are, cold is coming tomorrow.
[02:48:58.669 --> 02:49:01.769]  Be sure and wear your mittens and your hat.
[02:49:01.769 --> 02:49:05.910]  And they talk to you, I heard it on the news this morning, like you're a baby.
[02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:09.331]  And the average person kind of, oh, I like the government.
[02:49:09.331 --> 02:49:15.052]  And everybody kind of ninnies and is real soft and loves tattling and loves, oh, I got cancer.
[02:49:15.052 --> 02:49:16.512]  Oh good, I love the government.
[02:49:16.512 --> 02:49:18.173]  I mean, it's just so sick!
[02:49:18.173 --> 02:49:19.053]  It's so sick!
[02:49:19.833 --> 02:49:25.637]  And it was all planned this way and implemented by scientific means.
[02:49:25.637 --> 02:49:27.639]  Oh, Alan, what do we do, man?
[02:49:27.639 --> 02:49:31.021]  I mean, I am never going to be able to take my kids on a flight, which is what they want.
[02:49:31.021 --> 02:49:34.224]  They want to stop traveling, but I can't let a naked body scan my children.
[02:49:34.224 --> 02:49:35.665]  Well, they even want to do it coming in.
[02:49:35.665 --> 02:49:37.606]  Now they say they're going to have checkpoints on the highways.
[02:49:37.606 --> 02:49:38.947]  You won't be able to run from it.
[02:49:38.947 --> 02:49:39.508]  I'm sorry.
[02:49:39.508 --> 02:49:40.789]  Go ahead.
[02:49:40.789 --> 02:49:41.249]  Yes, right.
[02:49:41.249 --> 02:49:46.813]  They're talking about moving in at the major crossovers of the Canadian borders.
[02:49:46.813 --> 02:49:49.015]  So you can't even drive across now without going through the
[02:49:50.231 --> 02:49:51.932]  They interrogate my people.
[02:49:51.932 --> 02:49:56.376]  They make them have proof of the cameras they have with purchases, purchase proof.
[02:49:56.376 --> 02:49:57.536]  They harass everyone.
[02:49:57.536 --> 02:49:58.757]  They take your laptops.
[02:49:58.757 --> 02:50:00.318]  I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable!
[02:50:00.318 --> 02:50:01.619]  Yeah.
[02:50:01.619 --> 02:50:05.002]  This is what totalitarian society happens to be.
[02:50:05.002 --> 02:50:05.842]  We're in it.
[02:50:05.842 --> 02:50:09.505]  See, people have to realize we're in a totalitarian society.
[02:50:09.505 --> 02:50:10.686]  Didn't happen by chance.
[02:50:10.686 --> 02:50:11.927]  It was planned a long time ago.
[02:50:12.831 --> 02:50:19.276]  Well, the total proof of that is their own documents, but look how it's the same system worldwide, run by the same companies.
[02:50:19.276 --> 02:50:21.318]  And what they did, though, is they were smart here.
[02:50:21.318 --> 02:50:23.980]  They built the grid, and now they're launching it.
[02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:28.403]  They lined up all their cannons and weapons aimed at us, got us ready, and then just started blasting.
[02:50:28.403 --> 02:50:29.224]  What, about a year ago?
[02:50:32.365 --> 02:50:34.426]  And it's coming down so quickly now.
[02:50:34.426 --> 02:50:39.488]  And we've got to get the youngsters, they're getting the bulk of the scientific indoctrination.
[02:50:39.488 --> 02:50:41.049]  They're going to grow up accepting it.
[02:50:41.049 --> 02:50:46.432]  They already trained them first going through their school scanners to make sure they're getting used to the idea.
[02:50:46.432 --> 02:50:48.533]  And I said years ago, this is ongoing for life.
[02:50:48.533 --> 02:50:51.114]  They're getting trained for their livelihoods.
[02:50:52.202 --> 02:50:54.466]  And that brings me to the next thing.
[02:50:54.466 --> 02:51:02.419]  By the time I left high school, they would bring you in under a federal program and have you answer all these psychological questions so the feds could decide what type of worker bee you should be.

[02:51:20.826 --> 02:51:25.588]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[02:51:25.588 --> 02:51:29.509]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[02:51:29.509 --> 02:51:33.651]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[02:51:33.931 --> 02:51:34.491]  We're good.
[02:52:05.746 --> 02:52:09.774]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:09.774 --> 02:52:13.021]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:13.021 --> 02:52:14.423]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:15.126 --> 02:52:17.809]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:17.809 --> 02:52:24.194]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:24.194 --> 02:52:29.259]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:29.259 --> 02:52:32.662]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:32.662 --> 02:52:39.388]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:39.488 --> 02:52:41.830]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:41.830 --> 02:52:43.431]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:43.431 --> 02:52:45.893]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:45.893 --> 02:52:48.014]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:48.014 --> 02:52:53.158]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:53.158 --> 02:52:58.162]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:53:04.301 --> 02:53:13.004]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:53:13.004 --> 02:53:18.986]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[02:53:18.986 --> 02:53:25.528]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:53:26.088 --> 02:53:29.491]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:53:29.491 --> 02:53:31.933]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:54:02.412 --> 02:54:04.974]  What do you think of this?
[02:54:04.974 --> 02:54:12.738]  The parents of four Montgomery County children under arrest for failing to register their homeschooled children with the school district seven years ago.
[02:54:12.738 --> 02:54:13.799]  How is this allowed to happen?
[02:54:13.799 --> 02:54:15.059]  Who should be held accountable?
[02:54:15.059 --> 02:54:17.501]  Fact finder Marci Natal went and got some answers.
[02:54:19.036 --> 02:54:22.378]  Is it fair to say that these four children fell through the cracks?
[02:54:22.378 --> 02:54:28.042]  Well, from what I can gather, it sounds like there was education going on, so I don't know if they really slipped through the cracks.
[02:54:28.042 --> 02:54:33.066]  They didn't fulfill their legal responsibilities to file with the school district to be homeschooled.
[02:54:33.066 --> 02:54:38.430]  And then they go to the police and talk about how horrible the parents are, and how, why don't we have home inspections of all homes, and...
[02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:41.351]  It's not even illegal to not register your kids.
[02:54:41.351 --> 02:54:42.372]  It's a legalese.
[02:54:42.372 --> 02:54:50.076]  They used the CPS to swear out that they believed it was child endangerment, meaning you have a kid playing with dynamite or something, which they didn't.
[02:54:50.076 --> 02:54:54.299]  So they come and arrest them for a big event, and the media's like, more needs to be done!
[02:54:54.299 --> 02:55:04.584]  You have this Soviet outrage of grabbing the kids and arresting the parents, and showing their mugshots on TV, and then the message from the media is, that's not enough.
[02:55:04.584 --> 02:55:06.445]  Remember, the media is so evil now,
[02:55:07.506 --> 02:55:10.887]  That nationwide they tell you mercury is good for your brain.
[02:55:10.887 --> 02:55:14.589]  I've played that clip probably 150 times.
[02:55:14.589 --> 02:55:17.350]  Go to YouTube, type news says mercury is good for brain.
[02:55:17.350 --> 02:55:17.930]  We'll play it again.
[02:55:17.930 --> 02:55:19.471]  It's only 10 seconds.
[02:55:19.471 --> 02:55:27.554]  I mean, Alan, they are practicing insanity and craziness and we're gonna naked body scan you and we're gonna do this and that to just break our will?
[02:55:27.554 --> 02:55:34.177]  Or is it that people have been raised now with really no will or no mooring and so whatever they're told is good?
[02:55:35.148 --> 02:55:35.508]  You're right.
[02:55:35.508 --> 02:55:36.248]  There's no mooring.
[02:55:36.248 --> 02:55:39.329]  There's no cultural mooring anymore.
[02:55:39.329 --> 02:55:42.929]  That's why the first big attacks were to destroy all religions.
[02:55:42.929 --> 02:55:46.110]  They give you self-respect.
[02:55:46.110 --> 02:55:46.630]  Destroy that.
[02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:47.750]  They've been very successful.
[02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:50.771]  But then told to play during the 70s, the 60s and 70s.
[02:55:50.771 --> 02:55:51.311]  Just play.
[02:55:51.311 --> 02:55:52.731]  Be eternal children forever.
[02:55:52.731 --> 02:55:54.191]  Don't worry about the big problems.
[02:55:54.191 --> 02:55:56.212]  Just go out and have fun.
[02:55:56.212 --> 02:55:58.472]  And of course now we've been trained that way.
[02:55:58.472 --> 02:56:01.512]  We believe we're perpetual children.
[02:56:01.512 --> 02:56:04.593]  Most folk who are adults today think of themselves
[02:56:06.144 --> 02:56:07.584]  Well, it's an illusion, Alan.
[02:56:07.584 --> 02:56:11.305]  People drive around in their cars, they pay their taxes, they question nothing.
[02:56:11.305 --> 02:56:21.048]  They think the world is a wonderland, and they're just passively going... And every time the cops arrest somebody for no reason, or take their kids, or kill somebody, the victims make excuses for them.
[02:56:21.048 --> 02:56:21.988]  That's right.
[02:56:21.988 --> 02:56:31.131]  But they do know that through all their studies, over the last hundred years, 87% of the public will always believe what they're told by the major media.
[02:56:31.131 --> 02:56:34.712]  They can't hold more than two major crises in their head at the same time.
[02:56:35.752 --> 02:56:40.837]  And then now they're about to pass government controlled health care, but we're all talking about body scanners.
[02:56:55.851 --> 02:56:57.232]  And so that's how it works.
[02:56:57.232 --> 02:57:01.456]  87% of the public can only hold two major things in their head at once.
[02:57:01.456 --> 02:57:05.981]  And when the third one comes along, they delay the last one and forget it even happened.
[02:57:05.981 --> 02:57:07.562]  So this way you can keep it going from crisis to crisis.
[02:57:07.562 --> 02:57:10.465]  And I want police and military from crisis to crisis.
[02:57:10.465 --> 02:57:15.049]  When you're being brainwashed, now that you've learned these techniques, notice your commanders are doing it.
[02:57:15.049 --> 02:57:20.755]  They're taught this stuff and they think it's neat to be able to shutter minds and control people.
[02:57:20.755 --> 02:57:20.855]  Yes.
[02:57:22.785 --> 02:57:23.165]  Absolutely.
[02:57:23.165 --> 02:57:29.649]  So people really have lost a sense of dignity and self-respect and definitely a common culture.
[02:57:29.649 --> 02:57:35.072]  That was part of the big massive communist move for multiculturalism.
[02:57:35.072 --> 02:57:40.675]  It wasn't to be nice to other cultures, it was to help you destroy your own cohesive majority.
[02:57:40.675 --> 02:57:45.418]  Get rid of all other cultures and replace it with a corporate Borg-Prozac culture.
[02:57:45.418 --> 02:57:45.978]  That's correct.
[02:57:47.137 --> 02:57:49.580]  The culture now is men making jokes about sex and acting tough.
[02:58:09.175 --> 02:58:14.378]  Well, Alan, I am so alive, I burn with passion and life and love of liberty and decency and honor.
[02:58:14.378 --> 02:58:24.783]  And Madison Avenue first teaches you, as you said, to feel inadequate, to feel pathetic, so then the system can say, this is what makes you adequate, and that's all the slavery and weakness.
[02:58:24.783 --> 02:58:29.346]  But then the men feel even weaker, so they dive into weakness even more and are never quenched.
[02:58:30.126 --> 02:58:35.929]  And I just wish people knew the burning, animating fire of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[02:58:35.929 --> 02:58:40.532]  I wish they could feel it flowing in them and through them.
[02:58:40.532 --> 02:58:44.273]  I just want that spirit to rise.
[02:58:44.273 --> 02:58:49.036]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:53.733 --> 02:59:00.714]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:59:00.714 --> 02:59:02.795]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:59:02.795 --> 02:59:05.035]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:59:05.035 --> 02:59:06.696]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:59:06.696 --> 02:59:11.177]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:59:46.337 --> 02:59:56.942]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:59:56.942 --> 02:59:59.323]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:59.323 --> 03:00:02.105]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:18.470 --> 03:00:21.192]  Alan, I've analyzed Copenhagen in depth.
[03:00:21.192 --> 03:00:23.994]  It was a 95% failure.
[03:00:23.994 --> 03:00:32.481]  And we forced Gordon Brown, the real ringleader of this, kind of the current head of the circus, to then just come out when it failed.
[03:00:32.481 --> 03:00:35.223]  They couldn't get countries to sign on to the global taxes and controls.
[03:00:36.533 --> 03:00:41.458]  He just said, well, we'll just have the Western world go ahead and start levying the taxes and giving it to the IMF and World Bank.
[03:00:41.458 --> 03:00:45.622]  And we'll go ahead and start monitoring the third world and cutting off their funds if they don't do it.
[03:00:45.622 --> 03:00:47.424]  So openly showing he's a tyrant.
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:50.320]  But I am optimistic.
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:52.241]  They are drugging people in the water and food.
[03:00:52.241 --> 03:00:53.681]  They are dumbing people down.
[03:00:53.681 --> 03:00:56.882]  They are playing us off against each other, those of us that are awake.
[03:00:56.882 --> 03:01:01.222]  But I do see them... Things are not going as well as they wanted.
[03:01:01.222 --> 03:01:02.083]  Now, they readjust.
[03:01:02.083 --> 03:01:03.863]  They never give up.
[03:01:03.863 --> 03:01:07.044]  But I think humanity has a chance of beating this.
[03:01:07.044 --> 03:01:11.885]  Everything they've done is study us to know how to stop us from ever defeating them.
[03:01:11.885 --> 03:01:13.705]  But I really have some hope, Alan.
[03:01:15.134 --> 03:01:19.338]  There's always hope, and it's a matter of, again, never giving up either.
[03:01:19.338 --> 03:01:22.561]  They never give up, so we must never give up.
[03:01:22.561 --> 03:01:27.946]  And every day, new folk turn to tune in to radio shows and listen.
[03:01:27.946 --> 03:01:28.347]  Every day.
[03:01:28.347 --> 03:01:30.789]  And young ones do, too.
[03:01:30.789 --> 03:01:37.035]  And they're the ones who are going to have to take up the brunt and take the cudgel off eventually down the road.
[03:01:37.685 --> 03:01:40.347]  To make sure they have their rights back.
[03:01:40.347 --> 03:01:44.569]  We're only starting off the process and keeping the information alive at the moment.
[03:01:44.569 --> 03:01:47.391]  They'd love to kill the information altogether, but they can't.
[03:01:47.391 --> 03:01:47.751]  Not yet.
[03:01:47.751 --> 03:01:52.674]  For those that don't know, isn't Ocadio a Scottish name for a war club?
[03:01:52.674 --> 03:01:53.334]  Yeah.
[03:01:53.334 --> 03:01:54.335]  Okay, I want to make sure.
[03:01:54.335 --> 03:01:55.595]  Pick up the club.
[03:01:55.595 --> 03:02:05.181]  Yeah, that's what we've got to do, because we're dealing with, as you say yourself, the most ruthless people at the top that's ever existed.
[03:02:05.819 --> 03:02:13.866]  Who are so cocksure themselves now, they believe they can do whatever they wish to the general population of an entire planet.
[03:02:13.866 --> 03:02:18.770]  To the point of, hey, we're drugging your water and we're going to start testing your blood to make sure you're drinking it.
[03:02:18.770 --> 03:02:19.871]  Yes, and we're already doing it.
[03:02:19.871 --> 03:02:25.276]  We're already drugging most of the young boys out there that can think and have leadership qualities.
[03:02:25.276 --> 03:02:28.419]  I mean, this is full-scale war.
[03:02:28.419 --> 03:02:31.822]  Thought out a long time ago, as Julian Huxley said, we'll use pharma.
[03:02:33.035 --> 03:02:43.283]  And so did Bertrand Russell, he said, we shall look for those with leadership qualities, and if we can't bring them in through scholarships into our system, we'll have to eliminate them.
[03:02:43.283 --> 03:02:44.925]  That's what he said.
[03:02:44.925 --> 03:02:53.191]  Because they couldn't allow people who could convey what's happening to the rest of the people and become leaders to have to drug them or annihilate them.
[03:02:55.660 --> 03:03:23.627]  You know, I look at old photographs and old film footage of just, like, my grandfathers and people before them, and their eyes, especially their parents, you know, back in the 40s and 50s, they were coming out with small little reel tapes, and we found some and watched them, and just normal people in photos, I mean, their eyes were just burning with luminance and intelligence, and people looked so good, even if they were poor, or dressed scrap, I mean, they were, I mean, people just radiated power.
[03:03:23.627 --> 03:03:24.467]  There is no doubt,
[03:03:24.867 --> 03:03:32.950]  I mean, they admit the fluoride alone is a deadly toxic chemical that brain damages, makes you obese, attacks all the glands, but they are drugging us en masse.
[03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:33.771]  Yes.
[03:03:33.771 --> 03:03:35.351]  And that was always a big part of it.
[03:03:35.351 --> 03:03:41.514]  The combination of pharma working with the government was written about 60, 70 years ago.
[03:03:41.514 --> 03:03:43.095]  That was always their goal.
[03:03:43.095 --> 03:03:45.476]  A compliant, obedient population.
[03:03:45.476 --> 03:03:46.236]  Absolutely.
[03:03:46.236 --> 03:03:48.117]  Remember that movie, THX?
[03:03:48.117 --> 03:03:49.858]  The 700, they called it.
[03:03:49.858 --> 03:03:50.438]  THX 1138, which is a...
[03:03:54.488 --> 03:03:55.948]  That's what they're actually planning.
[03:03:55.948 --> 03:04:07.932]  That's by George Lucas, his thesis film, with Robert Duvall, based, for those that don't know, based on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, which is actually the plan.
[03:04:07.932 --> 03:04:09.573]  It is the plan.
[03:04:09.573 --> 03:04:18.896]  It absolutely is the plan, because Aldous Huxley was in on the big think tank meetings with his brother Julian Huxley, both descended from the Darwin clan, by the way.
[03:04:19.924 --> 03:04:23.187]  He gave his last speech before they probably killed him in 62.
[03:04:23.187 --> 03:04:24.729]  He just laid it all out at Berkeley.
[03:04:24.729 --> 03:04:26.070]  So this is all the plan.
[03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:27.171]  This is real.
[03:04:27.171 --> 03:04:31.976]  And he said, because we're so smart, you listening in the audience won't even be able to stop him.
[03:04:31.976 --> 03:04:32.356]  That's right.
[03:04:32.356 --> 03:04:43.307]  And it's just a small group of men, very powerful, rich, powerful men with the use of pharmacology and a good plan could literally take over and rule the entire planet to their satisfaction.
[03:04:43.683 --> 03:04:48.429]  Why do you think over 30% of police officers admit that they're on steroids?
[03:04:48.429 --> 03:04:50.792]  They actually need it because they've been gelded.
[03:04:50.792 --> 03:04:56.018]  I want the police who serve this to know, you are being chemically attacked.
[03:04:56.018 --> 03:04:57.721]  Chemically lobotomized.
[03:04:57.721 --> 03:05:00.124]  Why do you serve the New World Order?
[03:05:00.124 --> 03:05:02.607]  Because you're drugged right now and under a trance from television.
[03:05:03.700 --> 03:05:08.242]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:08.242 --> 03:05:09.162]  Number one.
[03:05:09.162 --> 03:05:12.584]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:12.584 --> 03:05:13.444]  Number two.
[03:05:13.444 --> 03:05:18.326]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:18.326 --> 03:05:19.066]  It's true.
[03:05:19.066 --> 03:05:23.628]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:23.948 --> 03:05:24.768]  Number 3.
[03:05:24.768 --> 03:05:28.349]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:28.349 --> 03:05:32.270]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:32.270 --> 03:05:33.070]  Number 4.
[03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:35.831]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:35.831 --> 03:05:39.512]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:39.512 --> 03:05:40.292]  Number 5.
[03:05:40.292 --> 03:05:44.433]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:44.433 --> 03:05:49.194]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:05:49.494 --> 03:05:53.660]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:06:05.936 --> 03:06:09.957]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:09.957 --> 03:06:13.198]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:13.198 --> 03:06:17.980]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:06:17.980 --> 03:06:21.841]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:06:22.501 --> 03:06:24.382]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:24.382 --> 03:06:29.366]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:06:39.693 --> 03:06:40.533]  Tim Geithner?
[03:06:40.533 --> 03:06:41.034]  Bernanke?
[03:06:41.034 --> 03:06:42.034]  They're arsonists!
[03:06:42.034 --> 03:06:43.615]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:43.615 --> 03:06:46.076]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:46.076 --> 03:06:48.197]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:06:48.197 --> 03:06:53.339]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:06:53.339 --> 03:06:58.361]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:07:04.352 --> 03:07:06.213]  Hi everyone, Andy Anderson here.
[03:07:06.213 --> 03:07:10.614]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:07:10.614 --> 03:07:16.415]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:07:16.415 --> 03:07:20.757]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[03:07:20.757 --> 03:07:22.457]  No more protection till you use it again.
[03:07:22.597 --> 03:07:23.958]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[03:07:23.958 --> 03:07:28.343]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.

[03:08:09.031 --> 03:08:13.876]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:13.876 --> 03:08:15.457]  You want answers?
[03:08:15.457 --> 03:08:16.378]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:16.378 --> 03:08:21.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:21.203 --> 03:08:25.267]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.614 --> 03:08:35.255]  Alright, I said I'd take calls today when Alan Watt was on with us.
[03:08:35.255 --> 03:08:41.098]  We're going to open the phones up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:08:41.098 --> 03:08:45.160]  Dustin in PA, Justin in Montana, Mark in Maui.
[03:08:45.160 --> 03:08:46.901]  Wish I was there, but I can't ever fly there.
[03:08:46.901 --> 03:08:48.902]  I'm not going to be naked body scanned.
[03:08:48.902 --> 03:08:51.703]  No, I'm going to still fly, but I'm not going to let them scan me.
[03:08:51.703 --> 03:08:53.384]  Ken in Mass and others.
[03:08:53.384 --> 03:08:54.685]  What do you think you're doing?
[03:08:54.685 --> 03:08:56.105]  Because you're giving authority and a tin badge?
[03:08:56.105 --> 03:08:59.427]  You're going to put me in a naked body scanner they wouldn't even scan Iraqis with?
[03:09:01.687 --> 03:09:04.071]  And I was talking to a man, Kyle Muller, on his syndicated show.
[03:09:04.071 --> 03:09:08.658]  They tried to do a bunch of stuff to him.
[03:09:08.658 --> 03:09:12.885]  The TSA guy marched up and started going, mm, mm, mm, with his wife and children.
[03:09:12.885 --> 03:09:14.127]  And he said, talk to me.
[03:09:14.127 --> 03:09:14.828]  The guy said, mm.
[03:09:16.022 --> 03:09:17.183]  And he said, talk to me.
[03:09:17.183 --> 03:09:19.185]  And the guy said, that's it, you're missing your flight.
[03:09:19.185 --> 03:09:25.010]  I want you to put that book, he had Atlas shrugged in his hand, on the scanner, through the thing.
[03:09:25.010 --> 03:09:28.093]  And he said, put him in the box, put him in there, and they were like, you're missing your flight.
[03:09:28.093 --> 03:09:31.316]  So he started yelling, this is a police state, this is wrong, this is a fraud.
[03:09:31.316 --> 03:09:32.758]  And they said, get out of here, get out of here.
[03:09:32.758 --> 03:09:34.399]  They didn't want to scare the other slaves.
[03:09:34.399 --> 03:09:37.922]  They want to see you dominated, but not see you stand up.
[03:09:37.922 --> 03:09:38.363]  Allen what?
[03:09:39.155 --> 03:09:40.935]  Oh, that's absolutely true.
[03:09:40.935 --> 03:09:50.118]  The last thing you want is to make a coherent, accurate statement and shouting out to the rest of the public what's actually happening.
[03:09:50.118 --> 03:09:59.981]  You've got to shout out sometimes and break the spell and tell them what is actually happening here and make them indignant and afraid.
[03:09:59.981 --> 03:10:03.302]  I've also noticed, and I want your comment on this, at Disneyland or at
[03:10:05.672 --> 03:10:10.415]  At all the other major theme parks, things like SeaWorld.
[03:10:10.415 --> 03:10:16.278]  You pay for your ticket, and then you walk up and they go, oh, you have to hand print with that ticket you bought.
[03:10:16.278 --> 03:10:19.900]  And then I refuse and they let me through as soon as I start yelling.
[03:10:19.900 --> 03:10:22.261]  And everyone else, it's the same thing at the airport.
[03:10:22.261 --> 03:10:26.844]  You buy your ticket, you go through, and they go, body scanner, put your kids in there.
[03:10:26.844 --> 03:10:34.148]  And all these photos on the news, we were showing them yesterday, when they put these women in the scanners, it shows the guys smiling, looking at their naked bodies.
[03:10:36.374 --> 03:10:39.476]  Because that humiliation is important.
[03:10:39.476 --> 03:10:40.596]  Yes.
[03:10:40.596 --> 03:10:41.437]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:10:41.437 --> 03:10:42.697]  And there's no doubt about it.
[03:10:42.697 --> 03:10:44.458]  They already see themselves.
[03:10:44.458 --> 03:10:47.660]  They can't keep anything secret that's on the net.
[03:10:47.660 --> 03:10:55.524]  They've had so many scandals in Britain with social security numbers being sold by the millions from the government to private companies.
[03:10:55.524 --> 03:10:56.224]  You can believe you me.
[03:10:56.224 --> 03:11:04.428]  They're going to have the next big thing that's going to be porn, or new porn, across the internet worldwide of everybody's body scanner silhouette.
[03:11:06.641 --> 03:11:07.082]  Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.
[03:11:07.082 --> 03:11:07.162]  Yeah.
[03:11:21.778 --> 03:11:25.881]  Or any rationale meaning of sex itself.
[03:11:25.881 --> 03:11:32.966]  Or even the fact that sexual bonding between two people used to mean a good healthy family would come out of it.
[03:11:32.966 --> 03:11:40.872]  Now, not the promiscuity you have today, and it's all taken so lightly on television with the reality shows, which is all about that.
[03:11:40.872 --> 03:11:43.214]  No bonding at all, just have sex.
[03:11:43.214 --> 03:11:46.056]  So that's why they're hitting the public now with this.
[03:11:46.056 --> 03:11:47.797]  They've degraded the public from the last
[03:11:48.217 --> 03:11:48.477]  Absolutely.
[03:11:48.477 --> 03:11:51.920]  And that's again what they said it has to do a long time ago.
[03:11:51.920 --> 03:11:58.806]  If we can get the children separated from the parents with scientific indoctrination from kindergarten onwards, that their minds are ours.
[03:12:13.479 --> 03:12:19.241]  But then if you try to homeschool your kids, they come and arrest you now with trumped-up, made-up stuff.
[03:12:19.241 --> 03:12:28.804]  Well, in the Italian newspapers a few months ago, the Prime Minister of Italy said there's an outright ban now on all homeschooling.
[03:12:28.804 --> 03:12:34.146]  He said the reason is, he says, every child must have the exact same indoctrination.
[03:12:34.146 --> 03:12:36.007]  Those were the words.
[03:12:36.007 --> 03:12:38.268]  Yeah, here they call it socialization.
[03:12:44.865 --> 03:13:04.371]  And anyone that doubts that, that standardized programming they're being given so they can have their social control, California two years ago had their court rule, it got overturned in a federal court, and we read it here on air, it said the state actually owns your children, you're not allowed to homeschool.
[03:13:05.950 --> 03:13:06.511]  That's right.
[03:13:06.511 --> 03:13:26.248]  And Hillary Clinton, too, ran on that ticket as well, that she would abolish all homeschooling, as there must be for all the big top communists, I'll loosely call them communists, for the world, to bring in this system of standardized... It would be better that your children get no education at all than to be put in public schools.
[03:13:26.248 --> 03:13:26.549]  Go ahead.
[03:13:27.068 --> 03:13:44.477]  Absolutely, because, again, for the wonderful utopia of socialism and a passive society, the children all must parrot the same things, all believe the same things, or having sex with an animal is good, and all this is coming up.
[03:13:44.477 --> 03:13:45.957]  And take three years ago.
[03:13:45.957 --> 03:13:48.439]  The New Freedom Initiative got leaked.
[03:13:49.139 --> 03:13:51.140]  Bush signed it four years ago.
[03:13:51.140 --> 03:13:54.061]  The internal documents from the federal board came out.
[03:13:54.061 --> 03:14:00.863]  This was in the Associated Press, but like it was a good thing, they said, we've got 20% of kids on government-issued drugs now.
[03:14:00.863 --> 03:14:01.723]  By 2015, we want 50%.
[03:14:01.723 --> 03:14:03.904]  And then in the decade after that, 100% on drugs.
[03:14:03.904 --> 03:14:05.304]  100% with forced inoculations.
[03:14:05.304 --> 03:14:05.804]  100% on the drugs.
[03:14:14.312 --> 03:14:14.773]  I don't know.
[03:14:37.113 --> 03:14:52.167]  And what's sick about it is you read UN and government documents that we've covered in detail here, there's literally thousands of them, and then everybody kept saying I should see the movie Equilibrium, and I saw it, and that's actually what they're setting up!
[03:14:52.167 --> 03:14:56.150]  They just throw in our faces what they're doing!
[03:14:56.150 --> 03:14:58.733]  Yeah, it's also predictive programming because
[03:15:00.172 --> 03:15:15.457]  Predictive programming is a strange thing, because when you're being entertained, you don't realize you're also being indoctrinated with an idea, and you're not passing judgment while you're watching entertainment, because the sensor part of your brain is not involved.
[03:15:15.457 --> 03:15:25.981]  So therefore it stays in your subconscious, and then when you hear it's coming out into reality, they're actually going to do this, it's familiar to you, and therefore it's not such a big deal that you go along with it.
[03:15:25.981 --> 03:15:26.681]  That's the predictive
[03:15:28.359 --> 03:15:33.901]  We know 40 years ago they had these passive MRI body scanners and now they're saying we've got to scan into your body.
[03:15:33.901 --> 03:15:38.022]  It took them two days to do that after I said they would because that's their program.
[03:15:38.022 --> 03:15:51.426]  Remember Total Recall with Schwarzenegger and all these other science fiction movies where when you go to the airport men in black ski masks run you through a system that scans your naked body.
[03:15:51.426 --> 03:15:52.086]  Oh yeah.
[03:15:52.086 --> 03:15:54.287]  And the book that it came from was written in 1966.
[03:15:58.115 --> 03:15:59.156]  I just can't believe.
[03:15:59.156 --> 03:16:02.258]  I mean, I knew it was going to happen.
[03:16:02.258 --> 03:16:03.619]  I knew it would start accelerating.
[03:16:03.619 --> 03:16:10.545]  But, Alan, do you ever just pinch yourself to witness it and to know this is just the beginning?
[03:16:10.545 --> 03:16:12.526]  I'm never shocked, to be honest with you.
[03:16:12.526 --> 03:16:14.088]  I know what's to come up.
[03:16:14.088 --> 03:16:19.472]  I know the next 50 stages as they come up for the next 20 years.
[03:16:19.472 --> 03:16:20.573]  So I'm never shocked.
[03:16:20.573 --> 03:16:22.654]  I read their books.
[03:16:22.654 --> 03:16:23.435]  I know how they work.
[03:16:24.062 --> 03:16:25.824]  I just can't believe how pathetic the public are.
[03:16:42.272 --> 03:16:45.834]  87% never really disbelieve the major media.
[03:16:45.834 --> 03:16:47.755]  They never question the whys.
[03:16:47.755 --> 03:16:49.876]  They believe government's telling them the truth.
[03:16:49.876 --> 03:16:53.919]  They can't believe that big lies are told to get us into wars and stuff.
[03:16:53.919 --> 03:16:55.380]  That's just too big a lie.
[03:16:55.380 --> 03:16:57.761]  So it must be true.
[03:16:57.761 --> 03:16:59.922]  And those are the ones they concentrate on.
[03:16:59.922 --> 03:17:02.484]  That's why they picked, by the way, democracy.
[03:17:02.484 --> 03:17:04.645]  Democracy is not ruled by the mob.
[03:17:04.645 --> 03:17:09.548]  It's that the mob will always be easily conditioned by the minority who rules
[03:17:11.613 --> 03:17:15.876]  Alan, go over the next several phases.
[03:17:15.876 --> 03:17:21.400]  Well, the Copenhagen Agreement, what they agreed to was the most important thing of all.
[03:17:21.400 --> 03:17:23.181]  And I knew that they would, and I mentioned it.
[03:17:23.181 --> 03:17:29.886]  I said they'll agree to agree to the next phases of the upgraded Copenhagen Agreement.
[03:17:29.886 --> 03:17:32.147]  And then leave it nebulous so they can do whatever they wanted?
[03:17:32.147 --> 03:17:33.568]  It's a blank board.
[03:17:33.568 --> 03:17:38.192]  They can go in there now and they've all agreed to sign on to whatever is put on that.
[03:17:38.192 --> 03:17:38.852]  And they will.
[03:17:38.852 --> 03:17:40.133]  That's what it's about, yeah.
[03:17:45.259 --> 03:18:02.244]  Yes, as long as it's noted somewhere in the history books that there are protesters with another view on all of this, and who can cohesively put their view over in a good format, then that goes
[03:18:03.656 --> 03:18:07.038]  Notice how, with the Green Tyranny, they always try to make it unified.
[03:18:07.038 --> 03:18:08.459]  Everyone agrees.
[03:18:08.459 --> 03:18:09.839]  No one disagreed.
[03:18:09.839 --> 03:18:11.580]  Not one scientist disagreed.
[03:18:11.580 --> 03:18:14.361]  And it's just an all-or-nothing lie.
[03:18:14.361 --> 03:18:26.828]  Yeah, the science is settled, said Al Gore, which is the most unscientific statement you could make, because science must always go over the previous findings and constantly dissect it, retry it.
[03:18:26.828 --> 03:18:32.671]  So it's all a political communist ploy, using the excuse to get communism through.
[03:18:32.671 --> 03:18:33.131]  That's what it is.
[03:18:35.939 --> 03:18:42.354]  Remember at the Reeves Commission they said their job was for the foundations with all their thousands of NGOs was to
[03:18:43.510 --> 03:18:50.476]  All through the culture so drastically in the Western world, they blend it seamlessly with that of the Soviet Union.
[03:18:50.476 --> 03:18:54.940]  Well, that's what it's all about, but they can't see we're going along with communism now.
[03:18:54.940 --> 03:19:07.772]  So they use different names for different parts of it, but it's the same agenda, a socialist system worldwide with experts running the world and all the lesser ones doing what they're told, with obedience.
[03:19:07.772 --> 03:19:08.733]  That's what they're bringing in.
[03:19:10.507 --> 03:19:23.192]  Oh, it's unbelievable, Alan.
[03:19:23.192 --> 03:19:29.695]  I'm going to come back and take calls for the balance of the 40 minutes we have left with you.
[03:19:29.695 --> 03:19:38.279]  It just hurts me at a primitive level, because I have this defense mechanism for innocence, to watch them arresting homeschooling parents now for no reason in America.
[03:19:43.487 --> 03:19:44.047]  Yeah.
[03:19:44.047 --> 03:19:45.108]  We have fallen so far.
[03:19:45.108 --> 03:19:47.271]  The U.S.
[03:19:47.271 --> 03:19:54.279]  was the last country in the world that had strong family units, and they're demolishing it right now.
[03:19:54.279 --> 03:19:59.045]  They're outlawing it, and they take the rebellion of the children and turn it against the parents?
[03:19:59.045 --> 03:19:59.666]  Unbelievable.
[03:20:04.744 --> 03:20:06.506]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:20:06.506 --> 03:20:08.909]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[03:20:08.909 --> 03:20:12.473]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[03:20:12.473 --> 03:20:17.238]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[03:20:17.238 --> 03:20:22.404]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[03:20:22.984 --> 03:20:27.486]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[03:20:27.486 --> 03:20:33.929]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[03:20:33.929 --> 03:20:35.569]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[03:20:35.569 --> 03:20:42.052]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[03:20:42.052 --> 03:20:43.693]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[03:20:44.113 --> 03:20:49.437]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[03:20:49.437 --> 03:20:52.339]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[03:20:52.339 --> 03:20:54.761]  Call 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[03:20:54.761 --> 03:20:57.143]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[03:20:57.143 --> 03:21:03.147]  Or visit zeolife.net and oxysilver.net and order your free report and package special.
[03:21:05.114 --> 03:21:09.157]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:09.157 --> 03:21:12.380]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:12.380 --> 03:21:13.801]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:14.514 --> 03:21:17.217]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:17.217 --> 03:21:23.583]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:23.583 --> 03:21:29.128]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:29.128 --> 03:21:32.051]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:21:32.051 --> 03:21:38.757]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:38.877 --> 03:21:41.219]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:41.219 --> 03:21:42.801]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:42.801 --> 03:21:45.263]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:45.263 --> 03:21:47.406]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:47.406 --> 03:21:52.551]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:52.551 --> 03:21:57.576]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:21:57.576 --> 03:22:01.660]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:03.544 --> 03:22:05.805]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:05.805 --> 03:22:06.385]  January 6th, 2010.
[03:22:06.385 --> 03:22:07.165]  Gold open this morning at $11.2670.
[03:22:07.165 --> 03:22:10.546]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.5739, $5.7870 for a half ounce, or $2.8935 for the quarter ounce.
[03:22:10.546 --> 03:22:11.166]  That's $11.5739, $5.7870, and $2.8935.
[03:22:23.573 --> 03:22:37.202]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:22:37.202 --> 03:22:45.787]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:22:46.047 --> 03:22:47.129]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:47.129 --> 03:22:51.494]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:22:51.494 --> 03:22:52.576]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:52.576 --> 03:22:54.438]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:22:54.438 --> 03:22:54.678]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:54.678 --> 03:22:54.979]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:03.710 --> 03:23:10.719]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:23:10.719 --> 03:23:12.802]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:23:12.802 --> 03:23:15.044]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:23:15.044 --> 03:23:16.706]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:23:16.706 --> 03:23:21.012]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:23:21.172 --> 03:23:23.733]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[03:23:34.536 --> 03:23:37.356]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:23:37.356 --> 03:23:39.977]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:23:40.077 --> 03:23:47.542]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:23:47.542 --> 03:23:51.264]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:23:51.264 --> 03:23:51.524]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:23:51.524 --> 03:23:53.446]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:24:06.849 --> 03:24:13.491]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:24:13.491 --> 03:24:17.673]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:17.673 --> 03:24:25.236]  We're going to Dustin, Justin, Mark, Ken, and others in just one moment, for the balance of the hour, taking your phone calls, hitting some other news.
[03:24:25.236 --> 03:24:28.397]  But I want to lay it out there.
[03:24:28.397 --> 03:24:31.198]  Joseph McCarthy, the Russians have now declassified it.
[03:24:31.980 --> 03:24:37.984]  A decade ago, was absolutely right about everything, to a certain point.
[03:24:37.984 --> 03:24:46.068]  As soon as he found out the Pentagon was running the Communists, which has now been declassified, funding them, he was destroyed.
[03:24:46.068 --> 03:24:50.551]  As soon as he found out big financiers were running it to consolidate power, to socialize our wealth.
[03:24:51.809 --> 03:25:03.620]  We need to realize we are up against a conspiracy of parasites and control freaks and compartmentalized crooks that the social engineers hire and roll out their programs through Federal Reserve money worldwide.
[03:25:03.620 --> 03:25:05.222]  They have unlimited money.
[03:25:05.222 --> 03:25:11.328]  And really start recognizing when somebody wants to interrogate your kids, they're a hardcore anti-American piece of trash.
[03:25:11.328 --> 03:25:14.311]  When somebody wants to force drug you, they're your enemy!
[03:25:14.311 --> 03:25:15.872]  Not just, oh, the government's out of control.
[03:25:16.809 --> 03:25:23.054]  We need to gut up and start letting these people know, we know you're criminals, and let their minions know they're criminals.
[03:25:23.054 --> 03:25:25.536]  And they're all engaged in crime.
[03:25:25.536 --> 03:25:27.538]  They all are immoral.
[03:25:27.538 --> 03:25:31.141]  You track a corrupt mayor, a corrupt judge, you're going to find them doing crimes.
[03:25:31.141 --> 03:25:33.403]  Put it on YouTube, burn them!
[03:25:33.403 --> 03:25:38.187]  I mean, folks, if you activate a secret operative against the New World Order, there's no orders.
[03:25:38.187 --> 03:25:40.549]  You know evil, you know corruption, engage them!
[03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:43.712]  Turn yourselves loose!
[03:25:43.712 --> 03:25:45.654]  Look what I've done in 14 years.
[03:25:45.654 --> 03:25:47.255]  Devastating the enemy!
[03:25:47.255 --> 03:25:48.697]  Devastating the enemy!
[03:25:48.697 --> 03:25:50.999]  And I'm only one person with one operation.
[03:25:50.999 --> 03:25:54.182]  You can all activate and do things untold.
[03:25:54.182 --> 03:25:54.702]  The enemy
[03:25:55.954 --> 03:25:57.675]  Operates covertly.
[03:25:57.675 --> 03:26:01.318]  You can operate overtly, covertly, there's so many ways to beat them.
[03:26:01.318 --> 03:26:11.365]  But when you realize you're in a scientific dictatorship, you're fighting for your very future, they're already poisoning people en masse, we're in the middle of just absolute war, as Alan Watt was saying.
[03:26:11.365 --> 03:26:12.546]  Alan?
[03:26:12.546 --> 03:26:24.075]  Yes, and hopefully one day down the road, the biggest Nuremberg trial ever, ever put on in history, where all these characters will pay for their crimes against humanity.
[03:26:25.959 --> 03:26:34.404]  And public service announcements will be educating people in sophisticated propaganda so they know how to recognize scumbag lying and manipulation.
[03:26:34.404 --> 03:26:41.308]  I really think the signs and symptoms of the psychopath should be taught in school.
[03:26:41.308 --> 03:26:43.489]  Because these are the type who go up into these positions.
[03:26:43.489 --> 03:26:44.970]  They get into the Pentagon.
[03:26:44.970 --> 03:26:46.711]  They get the ranks of business.
[03:26:46.711 --> 03:26:49.152]  They get the ranks of politics.
[03:26:49.152 --> 03:26:53.355]  They're an insatiable craving for utter, complete power.
[03:26:54.116 --> 03:26:56.678]  And they are definite signs and symptoms with them.
[03:26:56.678 --> 03:27:00.221]  They're totally corruptible because they have no right or wrongs within them.
[03:27:00.221 --> 03:27:04.164]  Whatever is right simply benefits them.
[03:27:04.164 --> 03:27:06.345]  But we've got to expose them for who they are.
[03:27:06.345 --> 03:27:11.469]  And they're obsessed with the science of control that they spend trillions studying.
[03:27:11.469 --> 03:27:12.570]  Yes.
[03:27:12.570 --> 03:27:17.034]  And you're quite correct though when you say that they want to drug your children and so on.
[03:27:17.034 --> 03:27:20.436]  It's the same as coming to kill your children.
[03:27:20.436 --> 03:27:22.578]  They're coming to destroy the brain of your child.
[03:27:24.425 --> 03:27:26.766]  Their soul, their destiny, their will.
[03:27:26.766 --> 03:27:27.847]  Yeah.
[03:27:27.847 --> 03:27:32.110]  Then you're dealing with murderers here, and they must be treated as murderers.
[03:27:32.110 --> 03:27:36.653]  Don't lose what they're really doing through scientific... Exactly.
[03:27:36.653 --> 03:27:41.436]  I think the biggest awakening, Alan, is realizing... I mean, I'm a normal person.
[03:27:41.436 --> 03:27:51.203]  I'm a normal, red-blooded, aggressive person who isn't stupid, but I'm not that smart, and when I read scientific manuals on how they're attacking everyone, I start warning people, what are you supposed to do?
[03:27:54.006 --> 03:27:56.028]  And there's got to be a mass movement.
[03:27:56.028 --> 03:27:57.709]  There's got to be a mass movement in grassroots.
[03:28:13.271 --> 03:28:14.673]  Oh yeah, lots of them are out of the loop.
[03:28:14.673 --> 03:28:19.938]  They don't have to be in the loop and a lot of them prefer to be out of the loop because they've got plausible deniability.
[03:28:19.938 --> 03:28:24.123]  Their own pockets are getting well feathered and nested.
[03:28:24.123 --> 03:28:28.668]  So they don't care how things are done as long as their name is kept out of it.
[03:28:28.668 --> 03:28:33.233]  But technically one day shall come and they will all answer for their crimes, their massive crimes.
[03:28:33.868 --> 03:28:35.610]  But that's the sick part about the New World Order.
[03:28:35.610 --> 03:28:47.162]  They have this sick logic, dark logic is what I call it, of where they have to warn us about what they're doing, and then they love, statistically, they attack their own mid-level and low-level minions.
[03:28:48.575 --> 03:28:53.079]  Well, you've got to understand the psychopath lives on pure ego, their own ego.
[03:28:53.079 --> 03:28:55.541]  And outside of that ego, nothing really exists.
[03:29:15.626 --> 03:29:19.529]  I've also been told by top globalists that they enjoy hearing about how evil they are.
[03:29:46.704 --> 03:29:47.465]  They love it.
[03:29:47.465 --> 03:29:50.309]  This show is one of their favorite entertainments.
[03:29:50.309 --> 03:29:52.532]  And the public's just like, kill me, I love it.
[03:29:52.532 --> 03:29:54.495]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[03:29:54.495 --> 03:29:55.896]  We're on the march.
[03:29:55.896 --> 03:29:58.420]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:58.420 --> 03:30:01.123]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:05.765 --> 03:30:09.728]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:09.728 --> 03:30:18.595]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:30:18.595 --> 03:30:23.219]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:30:23.219 --> 03:30:34.048]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:30:34.668 --> 03:30:44.171]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[03:31:05.763 --> 03:31:09.786]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:09.786 --> 03:31:13.028]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:13.028 --> 03:31:18.191]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:31:18.191 --> 03:31:24.215]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:24.215 --> 03:31:26.457]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:31:27.037 --> 03:31:29.418]  ...as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:29.418 --> 03:31:32.660]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:32.660 --> 03:31:39.524]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:39.524 --> 03:31:41.866]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:41.866 --> 03:31:43.447]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:43.447 --> 03:31:45.908]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:45.908 --> 03:31:48.029]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:48.029 --> 03:31:52.712]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:32:04.961 --> 03:32:07.963]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:32:07.963 --> 03:32:13.307]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:32:13.307 --> 03:32:15.348]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:32:15.348 --> 03:32:19.531]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only
[03:32:22.031 --> 03:32:22.851]  I think so.
[03:32:38.339 --> 03:32:38.759]  We're good to go!
[03:33:06.460 --> 03:33:08.124]  Out of approval by the FDA.
[03:33:08.124 --> 03:33:10.248]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[03:33:10.248 --> 03:33:12.953]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[03:33:12.953 --> 03:33:16.160]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[03:33:18.988 --> 03:33:25.452]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[03:33:25.452 --> 03:33:31.877]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[03:33:31.877 --> 03:33:39.242]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[03:33:41.321 --> 03:33:43.062]  That was aired nationwide.
[03:33:43.062 --> 03:33:49.044]  That was the local Austin version saying, Mercury's good for your children.
[03:33:49.044 --> 03:33:52.065]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[03:33:52.065 --> 03:33:52.485]  They are
[03:34:04.963 --> 03:34:06.444]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:34:06.444 --> 03:34:07.404]  Long time, first time.
[03:34:22.683 --> 03:34:28.505]  Um, I was calling in regards to a, uh, well first, I live in a small town in Lancaster, PA, of 55,000.
[03:34:28.505 --> 03:34:35.208]  Um, we, uh, recently had over 160 surveillance cameras put into our city.
[03:34:35.208 --> 03:34:49.654]  Um, the LA Times on the June 21st of 09 issue, uh, did an article on us, little old Lancaster and LA, and how, uh, we have public, uh, private companies watching us with our surveillance system.
[03:34:49.654 --> 03:34:52.115]  Um, I do work for the city of Lancaster and, um,
[03:34:52.688 --> 03:35:04.410]  I expected that we would be in charge and ask some questions and nobody knows nothing, but yet the government is federally funding over 170 surveillance cameras in our little old city.
[03:35:04.410 --> 03:35:17.572]  And that's to track everybody, every town's getting them, private groups get it, the government then in revolving doors, the private people in government make money as consultants and working for those companies and so of course it's all privatized.
[03:35:17.572 --> 03:35:20.773]  They take your tax money and then turn your town into a prison.
[03:35:20.773 --> 03:35:21.253]  Alan Watt?
[03:35:22.176 --> 03:35:23.096]  Oh, there's no doubt about it.
[03:35:23.096 --> 03:35:26.738]  A lot of big bucks are passed to the Feds as well to pass it.
[03:35:26.738 --> 03:35:32.461]  It's generally a company or companies from Israel that get the contract.
[03:35:32.461 --> 03:35:35.742]  So they're heavy lobbyists for the variant company.
[03:35:35.742 --> 03:35:39.163]  They're the ones that put them all throughout Britain as well.
[03:35:39.163 --> 03:35:41.084]  And you're quite right.
[03:35:41.084 --> 03:35:49.348]  The whole idea is to, again, it's got more than, it's not just to track you, it's to get you used to being watched, to alter your behavior.
[03:35:50.100 --> 03:35:53.081]  You're not spontaneous anymore walking down a street.
[03:35:53.081 --> 03:35:56.322]  Even in company, you don't laugh the same, you don't joke the same.
[03:35:56.322 --> 03:35:58.763]  You're always aware you're being watched.
[03:35:58.763 --> 03:35:59.983]  They're above you!
[03:35:59.983 --> 03:36:01.104]  They're the government!
[03:36:01.104 --> 03:36:03.385]  They're the all-seeing God!
[03:36:03.385 --> 03:36:09.427]  Yes, but it actually encourages you to alter your own behavior until you become Sovietized.
[03:36:09.427 --> 03:36:12.147]  In the Soviet Union, you didn't look left or right.
[03:36:12.147 --> 03:36:19.310]  If you walked down the road, you stared at the sidewalk and didn't make eye contact with anyone because it could be dangerous.
[03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:21.731]  By the way, that's been in the news.
[03:36:21.731 --> 03:36:24.913]  A lot of cops now, if you look at them, they pull over.
[03:36:24.913 --> 03:36:27.014]  You don't look at me, boy!
[03:36:27.014 --> 03:36:28.175]  You think this is America?
[03:36:28.175 --> 03:36:29.636]  Yep.
[03:36:29.636 --> 03:36:30.236]  That's right.
[03:36:30.236 --> 03:36:33.038]  And all the cops, as you know, have been completely militarized.
[03:36:33.038 --> 03:36:35.379]  Same military training.
[03:36:35.379 --> 03:36:39.021]  They're one big brotherhood now on the winning side.
[03:36:39.021 --> 03:36:40.842]  You're now called civilians.
[03:36:40.842 --> 03:36:43.083]  You're not the general public anymore.
[03:36:43.083 --> 03:36:43.904]  You're civilians.
[03:36:44.782 --> 03:36:49.043]  And you're threatening them when you look at them, or stare at them, or even ask them a question.
[03:36:49.043 --> 03:36:50.584]  You're very threatening them.
[03:36:50.584 --> 03:36:52.024]  Yeah, a lot of police around the country.
[03:36:52.024 --> 03:36:52.824]  Oh, excuse me, officer.
[03:36:52.824 --> 03:36:55.525]  And it's like, do I look like a travel agency?
[03:36:55.525 --> 03:36:56.625]  Get moving!
[03:36:56.625 --> 03:36:57.546]  Pay the taxes!
[03:36:57.546 --> 03:37:01.847]  I mean, it's just like... Oh, God.
[03:37:01.847 --> 03:37:03.547]  It's so humiliating.
[03:37:03.547 --> 03:37:05.088]  That's what tyranny is, you see.
[03:37:05.088 --> 03:37:08.089]  We're living through tyranny.
[03:37:08.089 --> 03:37:10.549]  Living through tyranny.
[03:37:10.549 --> 03:37:12.610]  And then the cops that aren't like that get made fun of.
[03:37:13.695 --> 03:37:15.596]  Yes, and he'll be out.
[03:37:15.596 --> 03:37:17.817]  If he can't fit in, he'll be out.
[03:37:17.817 --> 03:37:18.797]  Anything else, Dustin?
[03:37:18.797 --> 03:37:23.179]  I mean, why didn't the townspeople vote out the government and remove the stinking cameras?
[03:37:23.179 --> 03:37:24.540]  Yeah, well, that's the thing.
[03:37:24.540 --> 03:37:28.161]  A lot of these people here, now we're in a very diverse city.
[03:37:28.161 --> 03:37:32.763]  They said we were a study for the government, federal government.
[03:37:32.763 --> 03:37:34.424]  They always say it's a study.
[03:37:35.120 --> 03:37:38.702]  Well, they said we're a study to see how effective these cameras are.
[03:37:38.702 --> 03:37:41.524]  Now, there's, uh, these cameras are out there.
[03:37:41.524 --> 03:37:49.510]  The cameras were at an intersection where a female was beaten to death by her boyfriend, but yet they happened to not catch that part on the camera.
[03:37:49.510 --> 03:37:50.010]  Oh, no, no, no.
[03:37:50.010 --> 03:37:54.193]  They never prosecute any crime with it, because they like the crime.
[03:37:54.193 --> 03:37:59.736]  It's all to suck off the sheep, and they're going to start nationwide taxing you by the miles, sir.
[03:37:59.736 --> 03:38:04.940]  It scans your license plate point to point, and will ticket you, give you speed from point to point.
[03:38:05.921 --> 03:38:20.132]  The guy that they have, I met the guy that's monitoring us in a back room somewhere that's not even on government property and he looks like one of the slummiest men that you would ever see.
[03:38:20.132 --> 03:38:22.254]  Now who do you think they are?
[03:38:22.254 --> 03:38:33.763]  It's very scary and people around here feel like they're being safe but they don't realize that their whole civil liberties are being ripped out from underneath of them with the blink of an eye.
[03:38:33.763 --> 03:38:34.284]  Guys, go to...
[03:38:35.660 --> 03:38:37.301]  Go ahead.
[03:38:37.301 --> 03:38:39.182]  Actually, the eye doesn't blink, does it, Alex?
[03:38:39.182 --> 03:38:40.563]  It's always on us.
[03:38:40.563 --> 03:38:41.944]  No, the all-seeing eye doesn't blink.
[03:38:41.944 --> 03:38:43.365]  I appreciate your call.
[03:38:43.365 --> 03:38:48.469]  But then every time there's a hijacker or a bomber, the cameras don't work.
[03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:49.970]  That's right, Alan, isn't it?
[03:38:49.970 --> 03:38:54.453]  Yeah, the main purpose of this day is to make us alter our behavior.
[03:38:54.453 --> 03:38:58.816]  We have a term at the United Nations for how we start to alter.
[03:38:58.816 --> 03:39:00.497]  I think they call it self-policing.
[03:39:01.437 --> 03:39:11.408]  We police ourselves because we're always being watched and it's almost a subconscious thing that creeps into you and takes over the way that you behave personally.
[03:39:11.408 --> 03:39:13.711]  It's a behavior modification project.
[03:39:17.026 --> 03:39:18.067]  Unbelievable.
[03:39:18.067 --> 03:39:19.749]  Alright, I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:39:19.749 --> 03:39:33.183]  You should gorilla shoot video of that, and then of course, in your free society, we'll see if you're allowed to in America, but shoot video of the cameras, interview people, start a YouTube channel, you don't even have to use your name if you don't want, and
[03:39:35.020 --> 03:39:40.881]  I would just come out in the open, and you're right, and start protesting these and try to get the town educated about what's happening.
[03:39:40.881 --> 03:39:50.763]  We sent to Kurt Nimmo today, it's in color, this is just a scan of it, the army out searching houses, Lexington homes searched in hunt for bank robber.
[03:39:50.763 --> 03:39:55.844]  And they use any excuse to lock down cities, randomly search all the homes.
[03:39:55.844 --> 03:40:00.825]  Someone can be seen with a gun, or they hear a backfire and they lock down parts of the towns.
[03:40:00.825 --> 03:40:03.906]  They're training us that they're the boss to protect us, of course, Alan.
[03:40:04.420 --> 03:40:05.061]  Absolutely.
[03:40:05.061 --> 03:40:05.601]  I know.
[03:40:05.601 --> 03:40:06.602]  I know.
[03:40:06.602 --> 03:40:19.676]  I've seen it happen in Canada, in fact, where a hunter who fired off three rowings every year, just siding in for the hunting season, fired off on his own land in the country.
[03:40:19.676 --> 03:40:21.618]  He was opposite me at the time.
[03:40:21.618 --> 03:40:23.900]  And a whole squad of carriages flew in there.
[03:40:23.900 --> 03:40:27.044]  A woman over the hill who'd moved in, a yuppie from the city,
[03:40:27.674 --> 03:40:28.034]  I think so.
[03:40:48.672 --> 03:40:50.354]  Oh, that happens out in Travis County.
[03:40:50.354 --> 03:40:52.056]  People have their own 30-40 acres.
[03:40:52.056 --> 03:40:56.921]  They shoot a shotgun and all these people move in from big cities and they start panicking.
[03:40:56.921 --> 03:40:57.381]  Guns!
[03:40:57.381 --> 03:40:57.781]  Guns!
[03:40:57.781 --> 03:41:00.564]  But when they hear police with guns, they feel safe.
[03:41:02.122 --> 03:41:14.531]  They're brainwashed by television and that's the purpose of all the cop shows and television.
[03:41:14.531 --> 03:41:16.352]  They're not shows, they're not entertainment.
[03:41:16.352 --> 03:41:23.917]  It's propaganda to make you think they're all powerful, always correct, always above board, and they have your interest at heart.
[03:41:23.917 --> 03:41:27.399]  They're in charge of all, over all the bad things.
[03:41:27.399 --> 03:41:30.161]  And that's what all television dramas are.
[03:41:30.161 --> 03:41:31.442]  They're actually propaganda.
[03:41:33.244 --> 03:41:33.924]  It's unbelievable.
[03:41:33.924 --> 03:41:35.266]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[03:41:35.266 --> 03:41:37.408]  I'm trying to hurry through them now.
[03:41:37.408 --> 03:41:39.990]  Let's talk to Justin in Montana, then Mark in Maui.
[03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:41.892]  Go ahead, Justin.
[03:41:41.892 --> 03:41:44.855]  Alex, Alan, thanks for everything you guys do.
[03:41:44.855 --> 03:41:46.637]  I called about two reasons.
[03:41:46.637 --> 03:41:47.137]  One about
[03:41:48.601 --> 03:41:59.365]  The gunpowder and anybody who hunts or owns guns that they should start thinking about reloading and buying powder before they start making it expire.
[03:41:59.365 --> 03:42:17.652]  There's some talk about some powder that... No, the federal government does want to do that and they're openly buying up or shutting down the big gun manufacturers and ammo manufacturers and at the same time they're now teaching realtors that reloading equipment is terrorism and people get the police called on them.
[03:42:19.213 --> 03:42:28.306]  Absolutely, and the second thing was, I was following the story a couple days ago about this unmanned drone that the Houston Police Department is going to be using.
[03:42:28.306 --> 03:42:32.112]  And that they just tested here, I don't know if it was yesterday or the day before yesterday.
[03:42:33.711 --> 03:42:38.275]  Unmanned drones for spying on citizens with high-powered cameras on them.
[03:42:38.275 --> 03:42:42.638]  I think the headline is Unmanned UAV.
[03:42:42.638 --> 03:42:44.680]  Houston using unmanned UAV.
[03:42:44.680 --> 03:42:47.563]  Oh yeah, two years ago they got an FAA approval.
[03:42:47.563 --> 03:42:49.324]  That's nationwide.
[03:42:49.324 --> 03:42:52.847]  And they're using CIA spy satellites for the environmentalists now.
[03:42:52.847 --> 03:42:56.711]  If you build a tiny shed on your property, I mean it's just hell's being released.
[03:42:58.652 --> 03:43:00.053]  Well, it sure sounds like it, Alex.
[03:43:00.053 --> 03:43:01.614]  I just wanted to update you guys about that.
[03:43:01.614 --> 03:43:04.096]  Thanks again for everything you guys do.
[03:43:04.096 --> 03:43:04.696]  Thank you.
[03:43:04.696 --> 03:43:06.657]  And again, they want to bankrupt the economy.
[03:43:06.657 --> 03:43:08.078]  The economic numbers have come in.
[03:43:08.078 --> 03:43:10.680]  Everything is accelerating in its implosion.
[03:43:10.680 --> 03:43:15.843]  And they're just hiring more police, more bureaucrats, more controllers, more harassment, more in-your-face.
[03:43:15.843 --> 03:43:17.404]  I mean, it's incredible, Alan.
[03:43:17.404 --> 03:43:18.485]  Yes.
[03:43:18.485 --> 03:43:22.768]  And now you have all the eco-fees to come on top of every purchase.
[03:43:23.682 --> 03:43:25.763]  Uh, that you buy, basically.
[03:43:25.763 --> 03:43:28.804]  And that's what it floated to the United Nations over 12 years ago.
[03:43:28.804 --> 03:43:35.946]  They said they bring in a general world taxation for the, uh, for ecology, ecological reasons.
[03:43:35.946 --> 03:43:37.387]  And they're getting what they want.
[03:43:37.387 --> 03:43:41.948]  They're adding eco fees to your tires when you buy tires, when you take them back.
[03:43:41.948 --> 03:43:43.269]  Uh, batteries for cars.
[03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:45.670]  Now it's batteries now for your flashlights.
[03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:48.470]  You're going to have paid disposal eco fees.
[03:43:48.470 --> 03:43:49.951]  So you're going to have all this
[03:43:50.492 --> 03:43:52.274]  While shutting down new power plants in the U.S.
[03:43:52.274 --> 03:43:53.855]  and moving into China and India?
[03:44:09.008 --> 03:44:21.236]  Yes, and what gets me too is when Maurice Strong, one of the big players of the United Nations in the 1980s, he came in to privatize the electrical system for all of Ontario that was owned supposedly by the public.
[03:44:21.236 --> 03:44:22.477]  He did privatize it.
[03:44:22.477 --> 03:44:27.921]  He said at the time, we're not going to update the can-do reactors that are built in Canada.
[03:44:27.921 --> 03:44:36.386]  He said we're going to let them fall apart and only major corporations will have all these super devices to give them energy for the future.
[03:44:36.386 --> 03:44:38.528]  For the rest of the public, it's just too bad.
[03:44:38.528 --> 03:44:38.948]  We're taking
[03:44:39.569 --> 03:44:54.301]  It's high-tech reservations, government and corporate grids, and all of us literally living in total, absolute complete poverty, with new social services laws where if you're poor they're going to take your kids, and it's all being announced.
[03:44:54.301 --> 03:44:57.083]  And also the can-do reactor.
[03:44:57.083 --> 03:44:58.504]  Canada still builds them.
[03:44:58.504 --> 03:45:00.026]  We've bought a whole bunch.
[03:45:00.026 --> 03:45:02.128]  We're building them for China.
[03:45:02.128 --> 03:45:06.011]  We're building them for India and elsewhere, but we can't build any for Canada.
[03:45:08.334 --> 03:45:09.114]  Unbelievable.
[03:45:09.114 --> 03:45:10.515]  Let's take another call here.
[03:45:10.515 --> 03:45:11.275]  Thank you, caller.
[03:45:11.275 --> 03:45:13.856]  Let's talk to the caller from Maui.
[03:45:13.856 --> 03:45:14.716]  Mark in Maui.
[03:45:14.716 --> 03:45:16.916]  Welcome.
[03:45:16.916 --> 03:45:23.558]  In times of change, a patriot is a scarce man, brave, hated, and scorned.
[03:45:23.558 --> 03:45:32.381]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, however, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[03:45:32.381 --> 03:45:33.241]  Put your flag down.
[03:45:33.241 --> 03:45:33.581]  Come on!
[03:45:33.581 --> 03:45:35.822]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:45:35.822 --> 03:45:36.242]  Hey, buddy.
[03:45:36.242 --> 03:45:36.742]  How you doing?
[03:45:38.480 --> 03:45:41.662]  I got a lot of great gifts.
[03:45:41.662 --> 03:45:50.108]  What were the shirts?
[03:45:50.108 --> 03:45:53.690]  I believe we did get some shirts like that.
[03:45:53.690 --> 03:45:58.393]  We got a lot of stuff, but the guys in there are shaking their heads, but I do think I saw those.
[03:45:58.393 --> 03:45:59.114]  What color are they?
[03:46:00.491 --> 03:46:04.834]  It's a white shirt with blue and red print, and I sent you 12 of them, too, for gifts.
[03:46:04.834 --> 03:46:07.356]  And Ken, you can carry on your store online if you'd like.
[03:46:07.356 --> 03:46:08.236]  Yes, I got it.
[03:46:08.236 --> 03:46:08.816]  Thank you.
[03:46:08.816 --> 03:46:09.117]  Thank you.
[03:46:09.117 --> 03:46:10.217]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[03:46:10.217 --> 03:46:15.561]  President Obama was over here in Hawaii, and they stopped chemtrailing.
[03:46:15.561 --> 03:46:18.062]  And then he left, and they started chemtrailing again.
[03:46:18.062 --> 03:46:18.783]  I can't take it.
[03:46:18.783 --> 03:46:23.546]  We live in the wettest spot in the world, and they're drying up.
[03:46:23.546 --> 03:46:25.207]  Well, Obama loves you.
[03:46:25.207 --> 03:46:26.187]  He's a good man.
[03:46:26.187 --> 03:46:28.889]  He's really our president, and everything's fine.
[03:46:32.324 --> 03:46:34.826]  I appreciate your call, man.
[03:46:34.826 --> 03:46:37.168]  I tell you, he's fired up.
[03:46:37.168 --> 03:46:38.630]  I tell you.
[03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:43.354]  Let me go ahead and go to the next caller here, calling up my call list.
[03:46:43.354 --> 03:46:44.855]  Let's talk to Ken and Mass.
[03:46:44.855 --> 03:46:46.317]  Ken, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[03:46:46.317 --> 03:46:46.697]  Go ahead.
[03:46:46.697 --> 03:46:49.179]  Hey, Alex.
[03:46:49.179 --> 03:46:52.742]  I'm a first-time caller.
[03:46:52.742 --> 03:46:57.186]  I started listening to your show about a month ago, and I'm calling about the body
[03:46:58.658 --> 03:47:07.808]  I have a compromised immune system because I worked for years in hospitals and universities in Boston and got large doses of radiation without knowing it.
[03:47:07.808 --> 03:47:10.451]  It came down with mild lymphoma about 10 years ago.
[03:47:11.305 --> 03:47:13.026]  But that's what I meant by the New World Order.
[03:47:13.026 --> 03:47:14.927]  We have CBS News.
[03:47:14.927 --> 03:47:22.612]  Mainstream tells you that these scanners and similar systems do hurt people and do radiate you.
[03:47:22.612 --> 03:47:26.134]  And the TSA guys, they're all going to love getting testicular cancer.
[03:47:26.134 --> 03:47:29.716]  They're going to love getting cataracts from the radiation.
[03:47:29.716 --> 03:47:33.779]  I mean, that's the sick part is the system always hurts its minions worse.
[03:47:33.779 --> 03:47:35.080]  Go ahead.
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:40.503]  Well, what I did 10 years ago when I got the lymphomas, I went to Dana-Farber, supposedly one of the best hospitals in the world.
[03:47:41.092 --> 03:47:45.774]  And they told me that if I took the chemo every three months, they'd try to keep me alive for five years.
[03:47:45.774 --> 03:47:48.495]  So, uh, I said, I don't want to be sick for five years and die.
[03:47:48.495 --> 03:47:49.395]  I'll skip the chemo.
[03:47:49.395 --> 03:47:50.355]  And now this is ten years.
[03:47:50.355 --> 03:47:52.136]  I'm still doing pretty good.
[03:47:52.136 --> 03:47:54.437]  Oh yeah, they would have sucked all the money out of you and killed you.
[03:47:54.437 --> 03:47:55.577]  Yeah, they would have drained me.
[03:47:55.577 --> 03:47:56.057]  Yep.
[03:47:56.057 --> 03:48:03.159]  And, uh, so now I'm concerned about these, uh, scanners at the, uh, airports because I really can't afford any more radiation.
[03:48:03.159 --> 03:48:10.562]  So what I did this morning is I called Logan Airport and I, security, and I told them that because they have a compromised immune system,
[03:48:11.115 --> 03:48:13.658]  I really don't think I can go through these scanners.
[03:48:13.658 --> 03:48:22.546]  And all that they suggested, maybe this isn't a bad idea, they said if I get a note from my doctor saying I can't go through the scanner, that they would just pat me down instead.
[03:48:22.546 --> 03:48:27.251]  So I was thinking, you know, if the listeners would go to their doctors and just get a note from their doctors?
[03:48:28.035 --> 03:48:30.036]  Yeah, but let me expand on that.
[03:48:30.036 --> 03:48:31.256]  Let me expand on that.
[03:48:31.256 --> 03:48:39.418]  Then, it's not saying it's bad to begin with and violates our privacy and doesn't protect us, and that the Amsterdam airport had the stupid scanners.
[03:48:39.418 --> 03:48:41.058]  That gives into it, though.
[03:48:41.058 --> 03:48:42.079]  But it's an interesting idea.
[03:48:42.079 --> 03:48:44.880]  Alan Watt comments on that.
[03:48:44.880 --> 03:48:46.240]  It's a weird around it.
[03:48:46.240 --> 03:48:49.301]  They did say that anyone who doesn't take it will get patted down.
[03:48:51.094 --> 03:49:01.402]  This also has the added function, when you're scanned, of going along with another part of the agenda, which is complete sterilization of whatever fertility you still have left.
[03:49:01.752 --> 03:49:03.633]  Yeah, we've got 85% or more down.
[03:49:03.633 --> 03:49:04.614]  They've got to get that last 15%.
[03:49:04.614 --> 03:49:05.054]  Yeah.
[03:49:05.054 --> 03:49:08.116]  And of course, that's not a big crisis.
[03:49:08.116 --> 03:49:09.496]  In fact, I have a magazine in here.
[03:49:09.496 --> 03:49:10.817]  Where did it go?
[03:49:10.817 --> 03:49:12.518]  I see this everywhere.
[03:49:12.518 --> 03:49:13.679]  Falling Fertility.
[03:49:13.679 --> 03:49:14.980]  Give me a close shot, guys.
[03:49:14.980 --> 03:49:15.980]  Falling Fertility.
[03:49:15.980 --> 03:49:21.403]  How the population problem is solving itself from The Economist magazine.
[03:49:21.403 --> 03:49:24.625]  And then you open it up and it says, oh,
[03:49:26.551 --> 03:49:27.492]  Isn't it wonderful?
[03:49:27.492 --> 03:49:32.796]  Fertility is falling astonishingly fast and that's bringing big benefits.
[03:49:32.796 --> 03:49:37.879]  So they never say why suddenly people can't have kids or how the West is dying.
[03:49:37.879 --> 03:49:39.760]  They say this is wonderful.
[03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:43.843]  A dead, dying culture in the West is good.
[03:49:43.843 --> 03:49:46.205]  Just like shooting yourself in the head is good.
[03:49:46.205 --> 03:49:48.086]  The agenda is working.
[03:49:48.086 --> 03:49:50.248]  But the elites are all obsessed with having 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 children.
[03:49:55.267 --> 03:49:55.907]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:50:24.679 --> 03:50:29.064]  Good, glad to hear you're on the air, airwaves doing your thing.
[03:50:29.064 --> 03:50:33.408]  I've been listening for about six months now.
[03:50:33.408 --> 03:50:40.716]  Yesterday there was a major development in the Canadian news up here, that they're putting in 44 of these body scanners across the country.
[03:50:41.876 --> 03:50:45.118]  Uh, effective as of, I believe, the first of March.
[03:50:45.118 --> 03:50:46.899]  And they'd already pre-ordered them last year.
[03:50:46.899 --> 03:50:48.359]  I have the CTV on that.
[03:50:48.359 --> 03:50:50.240]  Stay there, we'll come back to you briefly, Steve.
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:51.841]  Jam in John and Douglas.
[03:50:51.841 --> 03:50:55.183]  Our guest website is cuttingthematrix.com.
[03:50:55.183 --> 03:50:58.204]  He's also a big part of Fall of the Republic, my film.
[03:50:58.204 --> 03:51:06.888]  You can order it at infowars.com and get a free t-shirt, but that deal is ending soon.
[03:51:06.888 --> 03:51:08.109]  This is not a drill.
[03:51:08.109 --> 03:51:10.030]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:51:12.056 --> 03:51:13.077]  We're good to go.
[03:51:35.114 --> 03:51:36.254]  Any circumstance.
[03:51:36.254 --> 03:51:43.477]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[03:51:43.477 --> 03:51:44.197]  But listen up.
[03:51:44.197 --> 03:51:50.419]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.

[03:51:54.441 --> 03:51:55.181]  Or call 877-327-0365.

[03:52:05.948 --> 03:52:09.973]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:09.973 --> 03:52:13.218]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:13.218 --> 03:52:14.640]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:15.550 --> 03:52:18.013]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:18.013 --> 03:52:24.419]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:24.419 --> 03:52:29.604]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:29.604 --> 03:52:39.593]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:39.713 --> 03:52:42.055]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:42.055 --> 03:52:43.636]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:43.636 --> 03:52:46.098]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:46.098 --> 03:52:48.219]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:48.219 --> 03:52:53.383]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:53:07.339 --> 03:53:09.080]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[03:53:09.080 --> 03:53:10.301]  Don't waste your money!

[03:54:11.683 --> 03:54:16.567]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:54:16.567 --> 03:54:19.209]  Final segment with Alan Watt, cutting to the Matrix.com.
[03:54:19.209 --> 03:54:25.695]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:25.695 --> 03:54:27.076]  Steve in Canada.
[03:54:27.076 --> 03:54:30.599]  I have the article here in my stack.
[03:54:30.599 --> 03:54:32.320]  In fact, I forgot to dig around for it during the break.
[03:54:33.268 --> 03:54:33.888]  Uh, here it is.
[03:54:33.888 --> 03:54:37.390]  Give me a close shot of this, guys, for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[03:54:37.390 --> 03:54:51.495]  Uh, the headline from CTV, that's the big TV station in Canada, for those that don't know, Ottawa ordered airline scanners months ago, so the Transportation Minister Barrett said, uh, he said, see, we were trying to protect you.
[03:54:51.495 --> 03:54:57.617]  Notice how this all coincided, Alan, with the underwear bomber.
[03:54:57.617 --> 03:54:59.318]  Anything else, Steve?
[03:54:59.318 --> 03:55:01.159]  Yeah, I just had a quick question.
[03:55:02.335 --> 03:55:11.159]  They said that if you didn't want to do it, you could opt out for the pat-down, which I think is a little bit of a... Yeah, so then they're going to phase that out.
[03:55:11.159 --> 03:55:13.480]  Gordon Brown even admitted what we already knew.
[03:55:13.480 --> 03:55:18.942]  First it's a few airports, then all airports, then well you can opt out, then you can't opt out.
[03:55:18.942 --> 03:55:22.344]  And then you get all these sheep by the millions in the database.
[03:55:22.344 --> 03:55:23.704]  Yeah.
[03:55:23.704 --> 03:55:29.487]  Everything starts almost semi-voluntarily, and then it becomes mandatory because everyone else was along with it.
[03:55:31.152 --> 03:55:34.654]  Everyone must biometrically scan to get their driver's license now.
[03:55:34.654 --> 03:55:35.395]  Thank you, Steve.
[03:55:35.395 --> 03:55:36.196]  John in Florida.
[03:55:36.196 --> 03:55:36.436]  Go ahead.
[03:55:36.436 --> 03:55:38.377]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[03:55:38.377 --> 03:55:40.659]  It's a pleasure speaking with you.
[03:55:40.659 --> 03:55:41.739]  Can you hear me?
[03:55:41.739 --> 03:55:43.480]  Yes, sir.
[03:55:43.480 --> 03:55:49.785]  I've been following the news vigorously for about two years now, and just some things want to get off my head real fast.
[03:55:49.785 --> 03:55:58.231]  I know you don't have much time, but I witnessed Bill O'Reilly here do what seems to be a complete 180 recently.
[03:55:59.326 --> 03:56:03.469]  Even Glenn Beck seems to be softening up.
[03:56:03.469 --> 03:56:08.953]  Yeah, they get the audience, like I warned you, and then they call for taxes.
[03:56:08.953 --> 03:56:13.696]  You're not a true conservative if you don't want to give the money to the banks.
[03:56:13.696 --> 03:56:16.818]  This is something that might enlighten people here.
[03:56:16.818 --> 03:56:22.662]  Honestly, I never heard of Alex Jones up until I did something.
[03:56:22.662 --> 03:56:25.924]  I connected my computer to my flat screen television.
[03:56:27.330 --> 03:56:27.550]  I don't
[03:56:43.899 --> 03:56:46.581]  You know, by going on YouTube and things like that.
[03:56:46.581 --> 03:56:50.384]  I gotta jump, you can call me back tomorrow if you want, but this is a big revolution.
[03:56:50.384 --> 03:56:59.031]  What's gonna kill mainline TV, which is why they're moving to censor the web right now, is people plugging it into their television sets and stop tuning into mainline TV.
[03:56:59.031 --> 03:57:06.997]  That's why they're putting stuff like myself and Jesse Ventura, the big show I was in last week, I'm in multiple shows, but it's re-airing tonight, 8 o'clock,
[03:57:07.697 --> 03:57:17.385]  Central, the new one premieres at 9 o'clock, but that World Extermination Death Plot episode airs tonight at 8 again on TruTV Central, 9 o'clock Eastern.
[03:57:17.385 --> 03:57:25.331]  But yes, they're moving to censor the web while also mainlining some of this info to kind of titrate the dose.
[03:57:25.331 --> 03:57:26.452]  Alan Watt comments on that.
[03:57:27.538 --> 03:57:29.218]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:57:29.218 --> 03:57:30.179]  That's all coming down.
[03:57:30.179 --> 03:57:45.923]  But the last part I'd like to say on this body scanner is they've also floated quite a few years ago when they first floated the idea of body scanners, sedation, total sedation of every passenger from takeoff to landing by paramount means as well.
[03:57:45.923 --> 03:57:55.085]  And the next thing they're going to float after this, how to drug you through the entire flight, along with the bracelet where they can shock you if they notice you get out
[03:57:56.254 --> 03:57:56.654]  That's right.
[03:57:56.654 --> 03:57:56.934]  That's right.
[03:57:56.934 --> 03:57:57.094]  It is.
[03:57:57.094 --> 03:57:57.334]  Pavlovian.
[03:57:57.334 --> 03:57:57.394]  Yup.
[03:58:15.114 --> 03:58:18.515]  Alan, incredible job, incredible contribution to Fall of the Republic.
[03:58:18.515 --> 03:58:22.156]  You're also going to be in Fall of the Republic Part 2 we're working on.
[03:58:22.156 --> 03:58:23.856]  I just commend you for all you're doing.
[03:58:23.856 --> 03:58:25.897]  People should support you at CutIntoTheMatrix.com.
[03:58:25.897 --> 03:58:27.517]  Find more of your great work there.
[03:58:27.517 --> 03:58:29.037]  We'll talk to you again soon, my friend.
[03:58:29.037 --> 03:58:30.778]  It's been a pleasure, Alan.
[03:58:30.778 --> 03:58:31.738]  Take care, Alan Watt.
[03:58:31.738 --> 03:58:33.698]  Now, I really broke down.
[03:58:33.698 --> 03:58:35.679]  They're breaking up the family and all the details.
[03:58:35.679 --> 03:58:38.380]  I meant to give the phone number out.
[03:58:38.380 --> 03:58:41.020]  We'll do it tomorrow for this family in trouble in New York.
[03:58:41.020 --> 03:58:42.321]  Ron Paul's on tomorrow.
[03:58:42.321 --> 03:58:43.261]  Ron Paul tomorrow.
[03:58:43.261 --> 03:58:43.901]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:45.939 --> 03:58:49.187]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:49.187 --> 03:58:51.393]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[03:58:55.365 --> 03:58:59.387]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:58:59.387 --> 03:59:02.629]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:59:02.629 --> 03:59:07.411]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:59:07.411 --> 03:59:13.815]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:59:13.815 --> 03:59:16.056]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:59:16.596 --> 03:59:16.896]  Tim Geithner?
[03:59:16.896 --> 03:59:17.397]  Bernanke?
[03:59:17.397 --> 03:59:18.078]  They're arsonists!
[03:59:18.078 --> 03:59:19.359]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:59:19.359 --> 03:59:21.602]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:59:35.498 --> 03:59:37.620]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:59:37.620 --> 03:59:42.783]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[03:59:42.783 --> 03:59:54.832]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
