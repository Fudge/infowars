[00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:09.541]  In the next two days, I am going to write up the rules.
[00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:19.218]  For the contest we're launching to expose the naked body scanners that the London Guardian reports, according to British law, is child pornography.
[00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.940]  It's going in Europe, England, the United States and Canada simultaneously from two major companies.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.242]  Billions of dollars of these were ordered in the last year, set to go in this year.
[00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:36.263]  They have the underwear bomber clearly staged to fear monger everyone to go, oh, I guess we've got a naked body scan.
[00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:38.304]  The troops in Iraq in the prisons
[00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:41.045]  And at checkpoints, wouldn't even body scan women.
[00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:45.005]  In fact, pull up the photo from yesterday for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.326]  The news shows you blurred out images.
[00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.366]  This is what's really being recorded.
[00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:51.367]  And the people have a right to know.
[00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:54.708]  Full genitalia, full breast, everything.
[00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:58.909]  And they're going to do this to your children, your wife, everyone.
[00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.129]  They're going in everywhere.
[00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:02.704]  We need lawsuits to be filed.
[00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:04.284]  We need injunctions to be filed.
[00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.745]  We need protest of the stock of these companies.
[00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:12.368]  Find out if your 401k has a mutual fund or something in it or in your money market that owns these companies.
[00:01:12.668 --> 00:01:14.729]  We're going to be cataloging.
[00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:16.990]  I need people out there to catalog all this.
[00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.212]  We have limited staff, but we're going to launch that to boycott and protest that.
[00:01:22.284 --> 00:01:23.384]  To educate the public?
[00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:30.567]  Because if they can break our will with naked body scanners and let you be publicly humiliated and break your spirit, they can get away with anything.
[00:01:30.607 --> 00:01:33.028]  First it's thumbprinting and face scanning to get driver's license.
[00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:38.991]  Then it's take your shoes off, your belt off, answer questions, not being able to have a blanket in your lap on a plane.
[00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:43.052]  If you're in the toilet more than 10 minutes, they land the plane, it's national news.
[00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:47.294]  All these acts of submission, all these acts of supplication,
[00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:49.421]  We're going to hit them hard.
[00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:51.863]  We have a listenership of millions of people.
[00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:53.984]  Hundreds of newspapers.
[00:01:54.604 --> 00:01:55.625]  I didn't even count it.
[00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:56.645]  30, 40, 50 more.
[00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.328]  Japanese TV, British TV, Canadian TV, U.S.
[00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:02.529]  TV, national TV, local TV.
[00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.769]  Hundreds of papers.
[00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:05.110]  The local papers in Austin.
[00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.211]  The papers south of me.
[00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:09.393]  Front page, the Obama Joker poster.
[00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:11.774]  We make the Obama Joker poster.
[00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:13.715]  We have a contest.
[00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:15.576]  What, folks won $5,000 for that?
[00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.542]  They tried to intimidate people and said they couldn't do it.
[00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:22.044]  People resisted the intimidation.
[00:02:22.084 --> 00:02:23.105]  They posted them everywhere.
[00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:28.773]  And it took this image of this God Obama and showed him for what he really is, a criminal thug.
[00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:32.918]  We defiled their God, their Big Daddy figure.
[00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:38.712]  And it was also an exercise in showing the people the power of just pamphleteering.
[00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:44.714]  Just posting posters in your local area where other people post them where it's legal and lawful or common law lawful.
[00:02:45.274 --> 00:02:49.895]  They can't selectively enforce and say, oh, we've got some old county rule that you can't.
[00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:54.816]  We'll have everybody else post up, but you can't.
[00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:58.237]  $5,000 starting now, in one month, for the best video.
[00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:05.714]  And I'd like it to be posted to YouTube, because that's where over half the video views are going on, but you ought to dopplegang it and post it somewhere else as well.
[00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:07.715]  We're going to create the contest pages.
[00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:10.216]  $5,000 for that.
[00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:18.541]  $10,000 for the best naked protest.
[00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:26.125]  Now, follow your local laws, but all over the country, the courts have found, for art or for protest, people are allowed to be nude.
[00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:28.326]  I suggest you wear Speedos or something.
[00:03:29.153 --> 00:03:32.515]  And obviously, attractive women, you want to fight the new world order?
[00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:34.156]  This is a way to smash them.
[00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:36.637]  You're going to be recorded naked and kept by the government.
[00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:38.939]  They're going to then make your children do it.
[00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.060]  To save the children, we have to do this.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.943]  Look at this beautiful, young, 20-something-year-old woman, completely naked.
[00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:46.683]  Look at her breast.
[00:03:47.824 --> 00:03:48.645]  Look at her body.
[00:03:48.865 --> 00:03:49.505]  Look at her.
[00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:50.826]  That is what they're seeing.
[00:03:51.914 --> 00:03:59.329]  And I told you, Homeland Security is now saying, and the former head of British Security, in fact, I forgot to print that article.
[00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.992]  It's on Prison Planet.
[00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:09.788]  I told people on Monday, came out yesterday, they're now proposing even more high-powered scanners that see into the body for hidden bombs under the skin.
[00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:15.072]  Because they could sew up a bomb under their skin and un-sew it in the bathroom.
[00:04:16.093 --> 00:04:18.254]  Oh, we need to wear taser bracelets, they're now saying.
[00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:20.976]  Or maybe Al-Qaeda will get a C. I was just always more, more, more.
[00:04:20.996 --> 00:04:24.038]  We're going to Alan Watt for the balance of the two-hour broadcast here in just a moment.
[00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.981]  We're now, again, 12 minutes into the third hour today.
[00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:30.723]  Four-hour transmission, Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:31.023]  Eastern.
[00:04:32.723 --> 00:04:32.883]  11 a.m.
[00:04:32.903 --> 00:04:33.443]  to 3 p.m.
[00:04:33.603 --> 00:04:37.224]  Central.
[00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.625]  $5,000 for the protest of the body scanners.
[00:04:40.645 --> 00:04:41.285]  Launching now.
[00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.666]  One month from now, the videos will all be posted.
[00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:44.866]  We'll post them as they come in.
[00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:48.907]  And you'll win $5,000.
[00:04:49.887 --> 00:04:53.508]  $10,000 for the best video shot.
[00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.210]  Can you imagine the level of views these are going to get?
[00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:07.483]  People will then learn and you ought to incorporate the images of what the body scans show and then point out we're doing this because this is what's really happening to you.
[00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:13.127]  And if we're going to have to bear it in here, we're going to bear it out there, to show the public, to shock them.
[00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:16.189]  This is the kind of thing that will make the government come after me, folks.
[00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:17.850]  This is really effective, peaceful stuff.
[00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:19.211]  This is what I'm really all about.
[00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.272]  We're taking a big risk doing this.
[00:05:20.332 --> 00:05:21.293]  I think you obviously know that.
[00:05:21.313 --> 00:05:22.674]  We're at the tip of the spear.
[00:05:22.714 --> 00:05:23.794]  We've come up with these ideas.
[00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:28.778]  We came up with the idea to have the states and the cities swear to the Bill of Rights.
[00:05:29.098 --> 00:05:35.703]  Eight hundred plus cities, five states passed laws against the Patriot Act saying their police wouldn't comply with unconstitutional orders.
[00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:38.784]  That got picked up by everybody, that was very successful.
[00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:41.226]  I mean, how many things have we launched?
[00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:45.027]  The going to press conferences confronting politicians, we launched that.
[00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:47.829]  Code Pink, everybody yells, we are change, we've implemented it.
[00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.371]  We are change for good, Code Pink, more often than not, not for good.
[00:05:53.272 --> 00:05:54.452]  My wife had this idea.
[00:05:55.593 --> 00:05:55.893]  Why?
[00:05:57.114 --> 00:06:01.096]  My wife, only for a year, worked for PETA, very pretty.
[00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:09.190]  And she went to Tokyo and a few other places and just took her top off and it was the cover of hundreds of newspapers and magazines against killing whales.
[00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:11.971]  Okay?
[00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:15.772]  She painted herself up like a cheetah and everything.
[00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.173]  And went out there.
[00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:21.394]  She got arrested too in Japan, but they dropped the charges.
[00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:26.136]  Again, everywhere in the country it's legal and lawful.
[00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:33.715]  In Austin, they've had a bunch of court cases where women that protest have been naked, and what was it, 15 years ago, more?
[00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:39.839]  They lost the court case, so now women, you'll be on the hike and bike trail and they walk by naked, you know, as part of their feminism or whatever.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.243]  The point is, this is, and we were on the Greenbelt the other day, I took a...
[00:06:45.123 --> 00:06:47.144]  Aaron and Rob for a five-mile hike.
[00:06:47.164 --> 00:06:47.924]  A little hike.
[00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:50.504]  This woman comes walking by with her top off.
[00:06:50.524 --> 00:06:54.865]  I mean, the point is, she wasn't very attractive, I'll tell you, but that's fine.
[00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:59.186]  I mean, the issue was, is that, but this can't wait.
[00:06:59.206 --> 00:07:02.127]  So we're gonna have a big protest date where everybody does it.
[00:07:03.267 --> 00:07:04.267]  I say we can't wait long.
[00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:06.728]  We'll set that out in about two weeks from now.
[00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:19.917]  Where everybody who wants to do it at the same date, federal courthouses, where they're implementing this tyranny, off the property of airports, on the side of the highway, at the entrances.
[00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.138]  $10,000 for the best video, that'll be judged in a month.
[00:07:22.178 --> 00:07:22.918]  But I wouldn't wait.
[00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:27.241]  And again, obviously, the number of hits will be important.
[00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.090]  How effective it is, what you have to say.
[00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.251]  It needs to be ten minutes long or shorter.
[00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:37.051]  Alright, I'm going to go to Alan Watt.
[00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:38.191]  We're going to do that.
[00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:41.012]  I'm talking to lawyers and other experts, looking at the U.S.
[00:07:41.072 --> 00:07:41.392]  Code.
[00:07:41.872 --> 00:07:43.232]  These are federal reservations.
[00:07:43.272 --> 00:07:45.293]  The airports have been illegally taken over by the feds.
[00:07:45.713 --> 00:07:46.753]  They're off their jurisdiction.
[00:07:46.773 --> 00:07:52.334]  They're now metastasizing out with the TSA teams at checkpoints all over the country, as we told you seven years ago they would do.
[00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:57.015]  Searching everyone from Dallas to New York, from Los Angeles to Miami.
[00:07:58.075 --> 00:07:59.696]  Wanding everyone, troops on the streets.
[00:08:00.156 --> 00:08:01.597]  I've got more articles today.
[00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:06.759]  We've got color scans of this up on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:08.699]  Here's the black and white color copy.
[00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:09.420]  Clear U.S.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.241]  Army troops involved in house-to-house searches in Massachusetts.
[00:08:13.942 --> 00:08:14.882]  That's all going on.
[00:08:14.922 --> 00:08:16.363]  I mean, we're just being hit from every side.
[00:08:16.383 --> 00:08:24.126]  But these body scanners are the key with, like, these different psychological syndromes where people serve the abuser.
[00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:28.846]  It could go either way, actually.
[00:08:56.849 --> 00:09:01.994]  I was thinking of someone who did that over the last few years as a big art publicity stunt.
[00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:06.018]  Yeah, they do it in major cities from New York to Madrid.
[00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:06.458]  Yeah.
[00:09:06.918 --> 00:09:09.581]  And so, in a sense, it becomes almost acceptable.
[00:09:10.322 --> 00:09:16.968]  And we're also living in a culture that's been promoting this, again, from certain quarters for certain purposes.
[00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:22.593]  Well, Alan, I understand that the globalists at certain levels have been desensitizing, but this is using their own system against them.
[00:09:24.136 --> 00:09:29.278]  I think people should all turn up fully clothed and just put the protest out there.
[00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:31.758]  That's how I want it to stay, you know.
[00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:38.561]  Personally, I don't want... The first thing to get pushed here is the fact that they're going to have... No, no, no, no, Alan, this is why I disagree with you and I rarely do.
[00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:41.662]  They're making you take your clothes off in the scanner.
[00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:45.563]  We are saying, look at what you want us to do.
[00:09:47.143 --> 00:09:48.704]  I think it's going to be devastating to them.
[00:09:49.332 --> 00:09:50.353]  I'll tell you what I would do.
[00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:51.935]  I'll tell you what I would do personally.
[00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:59.523]  I would just take photographs of all the mass graves of World War II and the Soviet Union.
[00:10:00.204 --> 00:10:04.028]  Of all the naked bodies and have big placards of that.
[00:10:04.489 --> 00:10:06.271]  And saying we're not going to end up like this.
[00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:08.021]  Exactly!
[00:10:08.102 --> 00:10:11.264]  Being unclothed, taking your shoes off, then all your clothes.
[00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:13.226]  It's a supplication.
[00:10:13.626 --> 00:10:17.869]  It's like herding people in to be shot in pits, stripping them down naked.
[00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:20.791]  Oh man, that's another great thought right there.
[00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:21.652]  That'd be a good poster.
[00:10:21.932 --> 00:10:26.135]  Dead bodies with the image of the naked woman from the scanner saying, we've seen this before.
[00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:27.416]  Don't airport scan.
[00:10:27.436 --> 00:10:27.797]  Go ahead.
[00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:31.339]  Yeah, because that's where you have to get in as to where this is going.
[00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:32.060]  It's not fun.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:32.961]  It's not fun.
[00:10:33.521 --> 00:10:34.462]  It's degradation.
[00:10:34.482 --> 00:10:37.044]  It's the dehumanization of the individual.
[00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:40.500]  Training us we have no dignity, no privacy, all the big government making us do it.
[00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:53.484]  I think so.
[00:11:16.687 --> 00:11:19.090]  And they're telling us that they take all our baby's blood at birth.
[00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.891]  That's now admitted.
[00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:24.396]  Oh yes, and Australia came out through the fact that they've been doing it for 30 years.
[00:11:24.456 --> 00:11:26.579]  One of the listeners went to get it back from them.
[00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:28.741]  They have them stored up in certain quarters.
[00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:31.905]  He wasn't allowed to get a hold of it 30 years ago.
[00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:33.687]  Globally implemented 37 years ago.
[00:11:36.733 --> 00:11:37.514]  Absolutely, Alan.
[00:11:37.534 --> 00:11:37.855]  Stay there.
[00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:40.238]  Let's go over the body scanners, the humiliation a lot more.
[00:11:40.718 --> 00:11:41.760]  And we want more ideas.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.382]  Everybody take action.
[00:11:43.422 --> 00:11:46.325]  We're going to expose the naked body scanners.
[00:11:46.686 --> 00:11:50.391]  Shocking the public into seeing how much we're being made to reveal.
[00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.306]  How would you feel with normal blood pressure?
[00:11:54.527 --> 00:11:57.509]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.511]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.973]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[00:12:01.993 --> 00:12:03.414]  To have a sex life again?

[00:13:06.476 --> 00:13:09.158]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:15.365]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:17.147]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:13:17.307 --> 00:13:19.589]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:25.176]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:27.198]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:13:27.478 --> 00:13:28.879]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:31.481]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:36.124]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:13:36.484 --> 00:13:39.866]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:13:40.207 --> 00:13:42.828]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:44.750]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.332]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:13:52.338 --> 00:13:52.719]  Good day.
[00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:54.441]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:54.981]  January 6, 2010.
[00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:55.942]  Gold open this morning at $11.2670.
[00:13:55.982 --> 00:13:59.326]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.5739, $5.7870 for a half-ounce, or $2.8935 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:13:59.346 --> 00:13:59.947]  That's $11.5739, $5.7870, and $2.8935.
[00:14:12.381 --> 00:14:25.889]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:34.575]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:14:34.815 --> 00:14:35.796]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:40.061]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:14:40.282 --> 00:14:41.303]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.

[00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:43.766]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:14:52.376 --> 00:14:55.559]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:57.761]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:14:58.221 --> 00:14:58.641]  Don't!
[00:14:59.082 --> 00:15:02.104]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:15:02.524 --> 00:15:09.650]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.292]  's number one debt secret.
[00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:15.295]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:15:15.675 --> 00:15:18.416]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:25.860]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.181]  Herb K was right.
[00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:30.363]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:15:30.503 --> 00:15:31.503]  What have you got to lose?
[00:15:31.843 --> 00:15:34.985]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.

[00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:39.910]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:15:40.151 --> 00:15:40.351]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:40.411]  888-352-7726.
[00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:05.559]  There's an article up on PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson with the headline, Breaking the Will of the People.
[00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:08.983]  The Real Purpose of Body Scanners.
[00:16:09.003 --> 00:16:13.327]  And you scroll down, it shows the Nazis and others strip-searching women in World War II.
[00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:17.530]  And that's what this is really all about.
[00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.751]  Going back to Alan Watt.
[00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:22.433]  Great idea, pointing out that they always strip you down before they kill you.
[00:16:22.453 --> 00:16:24.014]  I mean, it's a real act of submission.
[00:16:24.454 --> 00:16:32.019]  Do you agree with me that this, telling everyone you will be naked body scanned, is a key point in our conditioning and we must resist it?
[00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:33.299]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:34.140]  Absolutely.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.623]  It's a definite one, because Blair was talking about this long before this happened.
[00:16:39.343 --> 00:16:40.964]  This latest farcical incident.
[00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:52.222]  And it's an ongoing process of depersonalization, dehumanization, and getting the public to accept the fact they're nothing but cattle, literally nothing but cattle.
[00:16:52.942 --> 00:16:56.744]  And you feel small, you start to obey and submit.
[00:16:57.104 --> 00:17:00.166]  Submission is what they're after for what's coming after this.
[00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:06.009]  But if I was going to have a demonstration, I'd also have them wear those fake tattoos on their forearms as well.
[00:17:07.034 --> 00:17:07.535]  I think so.
[00:17:19.417 --> 00:17:20.437]  That's a great idea.
[00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:25.598]  Hand out images of the women in the naked body scanners with barcodes on their heads.
[00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:26.318]  Add that.
[00:17:26.738 --> 00:17:33.739]  Or women and men can put barcodes on their heads, on their bodies, paint themselves with barcodes as some type of covering.
[00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:36.200]  That's another excellent idea, Alan.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.040]  Of course, what comes next here is medicalizing all this.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.141]  Taking blood and urine at the checkpoints.
[00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:44.301]  That's already happening under federal grants.
[00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:45.561]  Warrantless taking of blood.
[00:17:46.462 --> 00:17:48.222]  They're also implementing
[00:17:49.082 --> 00:17:56.845]  Well, they decided a long time ago that a stage would come where they'd have to gradually eradicate most of humanity so that a million people could live in high luxury.
[00:17:56.885 --> 00:17:59.966]  That's a statement still put out by the United Nations today.
[00:18:16.075 --> 00:18:25.979]  They say that we can either live as 7 or 8 billion peasants in a low state of living, or 1 million people can live in a high state.
[00:18:26.419 --> 00:18:39.464]  So they're bringing us down through sterilisation, through the total destruction of the family, they don't have children, and it's an ongoing, long-term project, but in the meantime they must further de-humiliate us, because it humiliated
[00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:41.357]  And modesty.
[00:18:41.457 --> 00:18:41.797]  And modesty.
[00:18:41.857 --> 00:18:44.759]  Everybody knows the most evil governments strip you.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.923]  What do they do when you first come into a prison?
[00:18:48.943 --> 00:18:51.885]  They strip you and do a medical exam to humiliate you?
[00:19:12.062 --> 00:19:15.665]  They hold you down in front of the other prisoners, and they laugh at you, make jokes about you.
[00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:20.709]  And that's all part of it, to dehumanize, to humiliate the people.
[00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:32.539]  And when they arrested the protesters and my camera guy, they tortured Luke Radowski and others, made fun of them when they went to the bathroom, strung them up naked, and had troops there running it.
[00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:33.199]  Yes.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:33.900]  Oh yeah.
[00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:37.643]  And they joke away and laugh away, whether you're male or female.
[00:19:38.184 --> 00:19:40.806]  And of course, that's really dehumanizing the soldiers as well.
[00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:41.899]  It does.
[00:19:42.199 --> 00:20:00.190]  It actually brutalises them, it teaches them to be more brutal, because as an odd thing happens, it's been tested many times with different experiments, that they get into their roles, they begin to despise the meek and humble, grovelling prisoners, and they become brutal.
[00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.391]  It's a standard affair, standard affair.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.702]  Then they have their project, Hostile Intent, with their face scanning or facial expression saying, oh, you were frowning.
[00:20:10.062 --> 00:20:12.283]  That's my probable cause that you're a terrorist.
[00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:12.743]  Exactly.
[00:20:12.903 --> 00:20:16.825]  In fact, I don't like any possible comeback that you personally, when you look them in the eye.
[00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:20.908]  And they actually teach special forces what to do when you're in prison.
[00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:24.972]  Be humble, always look at the floor, never look in the eye.
[00:20:25.292 --> 00:20:29.415]  And remember 1984 when Winston said you had to watch the look on your face?
[00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:30.917]  We're now here.
[00:20:30.937 --> 00:20:32.398]  Yeah, this is an old technique.
[00:20:32.438 --> 00:20:37.182]  You see, even with the movie, a very good movie, it's called The Madness of King George.
[00:20:37.322 --> 00:20:38.343]  King George was mad.
[00:20:38.423 --> 00:20:39.805]  He had manic depressive bouts.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.161]  Look at Bilderberg!
[00:20:42.181 --> 00:20:43.662]  They're not allowed to look at him in the face there.
[00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:45.043]  I'm sorry, go ahead, King George.
[00:20:45.323 --> 00:20:47.585]  Back then, people don't realize that it was a crime.
[00:20:47.605 --> 00:20:49.706]  It was a crime to look the king in the eye.
[00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:51.467]  An absolute crime.
[00:20:51.507 --> 00:20:52.908]  You were locked up in prison for it.
[00:20:53.409 --> 00:20:55.610]  And that was in the 1800s.
[00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.532]  And right up into the 1900s, you were not allowed to look him in the eye.
[00:20:58.872 --> 00:21:01.854]  Hillary Clinton did the same thing when she was in the White House.
[00:21:02.655 --> 00:21:04.156]  None of the staff could look her in the eye.
[00:21:04.176 --> 00:21:05.177]  It was a major offense.
[00:21:06.197 --> 00:21:09.760]  And this is the standard technique of the psychopath at the top.
[00:21:10.608 --> 00:21:15.458]  Uh, who's utterly brutal and wants total subservience from all the meek and humble beneath them.
[00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:20.449]  And the more you comply and be meek and humble, the more they despise you for being so weak.
[00:21:21.553 --> 00:21:25.875]  And then that legitimizes their abuse of you in their sadomasochistic minds.
[00:21:25.915 --> 00:21:28.856]  And notice all the torture in Iraq and the secret bases in Europe.
[00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:30.117]  It's all sexual.
[00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:31.117]  That's been declassified.
[00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:33.578]  Raping children, using battery acid.
[00:21:33.878 --> 00:21:36.839]  Jeffrey Dahmer hellraiser stuff is now good.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.381]  The psychopaths are turning the whole world's psychological atmosphere into hell.
[00:21:43.162 --> 00:21:44.142]  We're on the march.
[00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:46.183]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:47.104 --> 00:21:49.785]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:59.093]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:21:59.214 --> 00:22:00.454]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[00:22:51.952 --> 00:22:56.197]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:56.497 --> 00:23:00.581]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:00.841 --> 00:23:06.247]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:06.587 --> 00:23:07.048]  It's true.
[00:23:07.328 --> 00:23:11.893]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:12.193 --> 00:23:12.734]  Number 3.
[00:23:13.014 --> 00:23:16.296]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:16.597 --> 00:23:20.340]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.080]  Number 4.
[00:23:21.321 --> 00:23:23.683]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:24.083 --> 00:23:27.466]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:27.766 --> 00:23:27.966]  Number 5.
[00:23:28.547 --> 00:23:32.470]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:37.454]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:23:37.734 --> 00:23:41.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.482]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:43.702 --> 00:23:45.785]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:23:45.965 --> 00:23:48.309]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:55.055]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:23:55.456 --> 00:24:00.416]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:24:00.777 --> 00:24:02.517]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:24:02.817 --> 00:24:07.638]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:24:07.818 --> 00:24:08.798]  How much do you want?
[00:24:09.018 --> 00:24:09.758]  When do you want it?
[00:24:10.138 --> 00:24:11.739]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:12.839]  When will you need it?
[00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:15.159]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:16.399]  Will there be any food?
[00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:17.980]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.220]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.540]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:24:20.701 --> 00:24:23.222]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:24:23.422 --> 00:24:26.623]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:24:27.003 --> 00:24:30.505]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:24:30.825 --> 00:24:31.805]  How much will you need?
[00:24:32.065 --> 00:24:32.666]  We don't know.
[00:24:32.946 --> 00:24:33.866]  How much do you want?
[00:24:34.046 --> 00:24:34.787]  All you can get.
[00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:35.807]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:36.087 --> 00:24:38.848]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:24:39.128 --> 00:24:39.488]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:24:39.648 --> 00:24:40.888]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:40.908 --> 00:24:42.109]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.769]  Get up, stand up.
[00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:43.829]  Stand up for your right.
[00:25:06.648 --> 00:25:09.573]  Get up, stand up.
[00:25:09.733 --> 00:25:11.495]  Stand up for your rights.
[00:25:11.716 --> 00:25:13.438]  Get up, stand up.
[00:25:13.598 --> 00:25:15.160]  Stand up for your rights.
[00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:16.382]  Get up, stand up.
[00:25:23.659 --> 00:25:29.186]  In the next few days, we'll post all the details at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:29.226 --> 00:25:32.210]  Three new contests.
[00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.694]  $10,000 for the best protest video.
[00:25:36.515 --> 00:25:37.616]  And it can be whatever you want.
[00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:45.072]  I think that the topless thing, bare minimum, because the public doesn't fully understand, you are naked being recorded.
[00:25:45.452 --> 00:25:47.473]  I think it's going to devastate them to use their own tools against them.
[00:25:48.233 --> 00:25:51.154]  Because that's an act that you willfully do instead of them forcing you.
[00:25:51.194 --> 00:25:54.815]  You are taking that like judo and using it against them.
[00:25:55.215 --> 00:26:00.577]  $5,000 for the best poster against airport scanning and whoever puts up the most and does the best job.
[00:26:01.097 --> 00:26:01.377]  Okay?
[00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:03.158]  You will win $5,000.
[00:26:03.998 --> 00:26:05.859]  And then what was the other one I came up with?
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.961]  It was another $5,000 for something?
[00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.262]  I'll have to go back and listen.
[00:26:10.282 --> 00:26:12.123]  I was spontaneously thinking of that on air.
[00:26:12.924 --> 00:26:14.865]  I said $5,000 for something else?
[00:26:17.507 --> 00:26:22.171]  There was another form of protest that I said was another $5,000?
[00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:23.852]  I'm gonna have to go listen to that.
[00:26:24.232 --> 00:26:25.233]  Did we write notes on that?
[00:26:25.473 --> 00:26:25.873]  My third?
[00:26:28.355 --> 00:26:28.515]  No.
[00:26:29.236 --> 00:26:29.396]  No.
[00:26:29.676 --> 00:26:31.778]  There's three contests.
[00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:33.759]  $10,000 for the protest.
[00:26:34.119 --> 00:26:34.680]  Best video.
[00:26:36.688 --> 00:26:38.869]  Preferably topless.
[00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.611]  Oh, 5,000 for the best political stunt.
[00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:42.031]  That's right.
[00:26:42.471 --> 00:26:44.452]  Good job, Dew.
[00:26:44.613 --> 00:26:46.574]  5,000 for the best political stunt.
[00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:49.535]  Legal banner hangs.
[00:26:49.555 --> 00:26:51.136]  Of course, he'll selectively enforce that.
[00:26:52.537 --> 00:26:52.977]  Events.
[00:26:53.317 --> 00:26:54.318]  Stuff on TV.
[00:26:55.498 --> 00:26:56.259]  Whatever you can do.
[00:26:56.379 --> 00:26:59.721]  Best stunt that you videotape and post to YouTube.
[00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:01.862]  Best legal stunt.
[00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:15.189]  I mean, that could be in your county where it's legal, putting on a $5,000 free fireworks contest and getting people there and handing out to 5,000 people body scanners and telling them, let's go protest next week.
[00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.611]  I don't know what the stunts are.
[00:27:20.153 --> 00:27:22.315]  I mean, let's see what you come up with.
[00:27:22.355 --> 00:27:24.917]  That's $20,000 in prize money.
[00:27:24.957 --> 00:27:25.678]  How do I pay for that?
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.944]  You the listeners, purchase the books and videos from InfoWars.com.
[00:27:29.964 --> 00:27:31.846]  We've slashed all the prices because of the economy.
[00:27:31.886 --> 00:27:33.929]  My mission is to get the materials out.
[00:27:34.974 --> 00:27:38.777]  When you get Fall of the Republic for $19.95, my latest and most powerful film.
[00:27:38.797 --> 00:27:40.558]  It's got Alan Watt in it, Max Keiser.
[00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:42.980]  It's got Webster Tarpley.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.783]  It's got Economist in there, of course, George Humphrey.
[00:27:48.543 --> 00:27:50.185]  It's got Gerald Cilente.
[00:27:50.945 --> 00:27:52.126]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:55.328]  Myself in the film, it just documents their whole agenda.
[00:27:55.348 --> 00:27:56.969]  And we're having victories against them.
[00:27:56.989 --> 00:27:59.731]  They're not invincible because we know their game plan.
[00:28:00.132 --> 00:28:01.713]  Get a free t-shirt of your choice.
[00:28:03.038 --> 00:28:03.838]  Or get a free video.
[00:28:03.858 --> 00:28:07.941]  We have a bunch of special combo deals right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:11.463]  And when you purchase books and videos, you support what we're doing.
[00:28:11.483 --> 00:28:13.284]  We're not funded by George Soros.
[00:28:13.304 --> 00:28:16.305]  We're not funded by the government like all these globalists, right-wing, left-wing groups.
[00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:18.786]  We are patriots standing up.
[00:28:18.987 --> 00:28:23.029]  And the globalists hate the example we've made of leadership and strength and honor.
[00:28:23.449 --> 00:28:25.350]  They don't want you to know that you have power.
[00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.911]  They don't want you to know you can stand up.
[00:28:27.191 --> 00:28:28.792]  They want to make you hopeless.
[00:28:29.878 --> 00:28:32.140]  But we're standing up and showing people the power of the people.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.141]  Look what happened in Copenhagen.
[00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:34.202]  That was annihilated.
[00:28:34.222 --> 00:28:35.443]  We'll get Alan Watts' take on that.
[00:28:36.184 --> 00:28:37.265]  Infowars.com.
[00:28:37.285 --> 00:28:40.227]  Take advantage of the deals, the free videos and t-shirts, or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:40.347 --> 00:28:42.149]  You can also write to me at P.O.
[00:28:42.209 --> 00:28:42.849]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:28:42.889 --> 00:28:43.350]  That's P.O.
[00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.471]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.341]  And five plus months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv until next Friday and then that deal is gone until next year.
[00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:02.522]  The New Year's Special, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:02.782 --> 00:29:04.262]  Okay, Alan, I'm gonna try to shut up now.
[00:29:04.282 --> 00:29:14.745]  I'm just so wound up about what's happening because I have never let my family, my children have never flown because I won't have them strip searched or beat up or they're always killing people in the TSA and I won't...
[00:29:15.245 --> 00:29:25.035]  I can't watch them humiliated, taking their shoes off, and being indoctrinated to be slaves for the next phase of being naked body scanned, and they use the instrumentality of a machine like that makes it okay.
[00:29:25.495 --> 00:29:29.018]  Be like instead of a cop shooting you in the head, he had a robot shoot you in the head, so it's okay.
[00:29:29.939 --> 00:29:32.422]  It's men looking at a screen of your naked body and saving it.
[00:29:32.442 --> 00:29:33.703]  It's even worse than a strip search.
[00:29:33.743 --> 00:29:36.546]  It'd be like if they led you in and stripped you and videotaped it and laughed at you.
[00:29:37.904 --> 00:29:38.905]  How do we beat this?
[00:29:39.005 --> 00:29:39.825]  How do we resist it?
[00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:47.309]  How do we not just contribute to the Stockholm Syndrome of covering all of this, and then people just get hopeless?
[00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:48.329]  How do we fight back?
[00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:49.870]  How do we defeat these people?
[00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:59.095]  Then I want to get into how worldwide, from Germany to New York State, they're arresting homeschooling parents for no reason, in big public rage, trumping up fake charges.
[00:29:59.115 --> 00:30:02.777]  I'm going to give the number out to that county coming up, folks, for people to call later.
[00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:07.387]  They are moving on us on every front.
[00:30:07.427 --> 00:30:12.229]  Copenhagen was mainly a defeat, but Gordon Brown said, I don't care if you didn't sign on.
[00:30:12.249 --> 00:30:13.269]  We're still going to implement it.
[00:30:13.809 --> 00:30:14.290]  Alan, what?
[00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:15.710]  Yes.
[00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:18.711]  Again, people have to realize that they're not.
[00:30:19.832 --> 00:30:20.572]  You're not a nobody.
[00:30:20.832 --> 00:30:21.873]  No one is a nobody.
[00:30:22.273 --> 00:30:27.275]  And that's been the technique that's been used for so long is to make us all think we're nobodies.
[00:30:28.035 --> 00:30:34.458]  And that special people that come out of special wombs are up there to guide you and to manage your life for you.
[00:30:35.262 --> 00:30:39.244]  We have been taught since the 60s, in other words, to be children, perpetual children.
[00:30:39.564 --> 00:30:43.546]  Don't get involved in politics, ignore it, just have a good time and play.
[00:30:44.266 --> 00:30:50.810]  And now it's all coming home because you have people now who are at that stage of mentality but have never matured.
[00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.151]  A lot of people out there have never matured.
[00:30:53.511 --> 00:30:57.873]  They're living now as they did when they were 18 years of age, even if they're 40.
[00:30:59.534 --> 00:31:03.676]  So we're aiming at the people who can still think, who still have a sense of self-respect.
[00:31:04.452 --> 00:31:07.956]  And know how to give it back to people who have lost it along the way.
[00:31:07.976 --> 00:31:09.238]  Their own self-respect.
[00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:13.463]  Government exists by the will of the people.
[00:31:13.863 --> 00:31:15.605]  Government is only an idea.
[00:31:15.625 --> 00:31:17.167]  That's all it is.
[00:31:18.108 --> 00:31:19.129]  And it only gets away with it.
[00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:19.790]  It's like money.
[00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:24.095]  If you think that money works and someone will accept it, then things will work.
[00:31:25.095 --> 00:31:27.358]  If you have faith in the government, it will work.
[00:31:28.339 --> 00:31:33.625]  But if you give complete faith in the government, it will work in its own way and not for your benefit.
[00:31:33.906 --> 00:31:37.610]  However, it still only exists because you allow it to exist.
[00:31:38.422 --> 00:31:40.963]  And that's got to get pushed home to these boys at the top.
[00:31:40.983 --> 00:31:41.763]  They know this, too.
[00:31:41.803 --> 00:31:45.404]  They're preparing for all kinds of possible scenarios.
[00:31:45.424 --> 00:31:52.426]  They've thought through the whole next 50 years agenda, and they're preparing for all possible outcomes.
[00:31:52.846 --> 00:32:05.630]  But what they don't want is a passive, yet subtly aggressive push and mass demonstrations for people to take back their rights and to put the government back in its place.
[00:32:07.128 --> 00:32:15.243]  Every government in the world has got to start putting down on its folks the recall of people who do not fulfill their promises in elections.
[00:32:15.643 --> 00:32:19.931]  When they go off on some strange tangent as soon as they're in office, they should be out the door and
[00:32:21.545 --> 00:32:28.411]  Instead of in England the left and right in the US left and right most people are still caught up They hate the party that's in power.
[00:32:28.491 --> 00:32:29.852]  They vote for the party out of power.
[00:32:29.912 --> 00:32:31.873]  Then they hate that party They vote for the next party.
[00:32:32.214 --> 00:32:44.324]  It's all staged We have to have a paradigm shift and stop looking at the low-level puppets and see the real architecture of enslavement Yes, and we got to get the big foundations and the CFR
[00:32:45.794 --> 00:32:46.134]  I think?
[00:33:05.157 --> 00:33:05.998]  I don't know.
[00:33:24.867 --> 00:33:30.372]  And they are parasites, and they love the fact that they're in the process of disarming us, as is happening in Canada right now.
[00:33:30.512 --> 00:33:37.018]  Alan, you talk a lot about how they, and this is in their own documents, again, Charlotte Izzybee's books full of the documents,
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:46.842]  About how they're turning man against woman, woman against man, black against white, muslim against jew, catholic against protestant, northerner against southerner.
[00:33:47.422 --> 00:33:49.623]  Always balkanizing everyone.
[00:33:49.663 --> 00:33:53.164]  Here's an article, and give me a document cam, shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:33:53.624 --> 00:33:55.825]  France to criminalize shouting at your wife.
[00:33:56.285 --> 00:34:02.767]  Married couples could be arrested and charged for insulting each other under a new law in France banning psychological violence.
[00:34:03.347 --> 00:34:04.047]  And in the U.S.
[00:34:04.067 --> 00:34:07.688]  they're starting to take people's kids if they're seen yelling at them, even if it isn't against the law.
[00:34:08.955 --> 00:34:17.001]  And then it says right here that it's going to be implemented with a ticket the first time, and then jail time, and then huge fines.
[00:34:17.041 --> 00:34:21.024]  And it says that they're encouraging men and women to tattle on each other.
[00:34:21.044 --> 00:34:23.606]  And women are being taught, your husband's arguing with you?
[00:34:23.886 --> 00:34:24.607]  Call the police.
[00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:30.292]  And so again, they are literally moving forward with this agenda.
[00:34:30.332 --> 00:34:31.393]  I wanted to read one part.
[00:34:31.693 --> 00:34:42.277]  Police are being urged to issue a caution in the first instance of a reported crime of raising their voice, but repeated offenses could face a fine or electronic tagging or jail.
[00:34:42.317 --> 00:34:46.799]  See, all these petty things that aren't even crimes, everybody's got to be tagged.
[00:34:49.977 --> 00:34:54.121]  Yeah, well, I tell you, people have to stop being politically correct.
[00:34:54.141 --> 00:35:01.848]  This is all training people to be politically correct and to keep updating it off, because they know where they're going with it all, into a robotic society.
[00:35:02.249 --> 00:35:07.774]  But it's also to make sure that you cannot live outside the government's control.
[00:35:08.715 --> 00:35:13.319]  In other words, if you're going to have an argument, you must have a professional counsellor there to have it.
[00:35:14.062 --> 00:35:27.607]  Well now they're saying out of 60 million or 50 million French, whatever it is, pull up the population number of France, they're saying 157 French men and women killed each other in 2008, and we can't allow that.
[00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:42.091]  Like one underwear bomber, all our rights leave, they naked scan us, and now we may have to ban marriage and make everybody live in dormitories because every once in a while people kill each other, and oh my gosh, sometimes parents abuse babies, so 20,000 homes in England, now
[00:35:43.592 --> 00:35:48.437]  At birth, cameras go in your home until the kids leave when they're 18, and the government watches you!
[00:35:48.457 --> 00:35:48.997]  That's right.
[00:35:49.478 --> 00:35:49.698]  See?
[00:35:49.958 --> 00:35:53.662]  Oh, well, my God, sometimes people fight, so we've just got to ban this institution!
[00:35:53.982 --> 00:35:55.583]  They're actually talking about it!
[00:35:55.784 --> 00:35:57.365]  It was back in the 1960s.
[00:35:57.946 --> 00:36:06.674]  An American Psychological Association's own magazine, they said that in the 60s, eventually, they'll go put cameras in every citizen's homes.
[00:36:07.778 --> 00:36:17.285]  And it will pick up any signs of aggression, such as your mouth going down, eyes narrowing, and they will have an intervention team.
[00:36:17.385 --> 00:36:19.587]  They'll come in straight away before anything happens.
[00:36:20.027 --> 00:36:23.409]  Now, you've got to understand, we're simply following through a script here.
[00:36:23.429 --> 00:36:25.851]  It's an intergenerational script.
[00:36:26.332 --> 00:36:28.133]  It's updated for each generation.
[00:36:28.813 --> 00:36:31.115]  And it's not happening by the moment.
[00:36:31.135 --> 00:36:35.278]  It happens down to some strange new idea that came out of Parliament or Congress.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.475]  It was implemented and written into UN various constitutions 40, 50, 60,
[00:36:42.515 --> 00:36:44.577]  And now they're announcing their world government.
[00:36:44.597 --> 00:36:47.078]  By the way, France has 61.5 million people.
[00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:56.405]  And now, Ellen, why are they now coming right out and saying, Von Rumpy, the head of the EU, Gore, Gordon Brown, they're all saying global governance is here.
[00:36:57.186 --> 00:37:00.508]  They announced at the conference, yes, we want it to be a global one-child policy.
[00:37:00.568 --> 00:37:05.592]  Yes, we want to shut down the money so you can't afford to have children.
[00:37:05.972 --> 00:37:07.773]  And then we'll CPS them if you're poor.
[00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:09.695]  And yes,
[00:37:11.636 --> 00:37:16.858]  This is really all about population reduction, and now Austin has announced the city.
[00:37:17.218 --> 00:37:18.879]  Yes, we don't want to build new roads.
[00:37:19.259 --> 00:37:20.899]  We're going to force you to take buses.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.720]  We are your social engineers.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.801]  We own your butt.
[00:37:25.561 --> 00:37:27.582]  Yeah, again, a very old agenda.
[00:37:27.602 --> 00:37:38.646]  They've written years ago of how they would do this, in fact, and how they would implement it by stages as they gradually altered the perceptions of each generation.
[00:37:39.025 --> 00:37:40.486]  So why are they now announcing it?
[00:37:40.546 --> 00:37:41.826]  Why are they getting so bold?
[00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:44.388]  Why is everything moving ten times faster?
[00:37:44.628 --> 00:37:46.589]  They really believe now it's time.
[00:37:46.649 --> 00:37:47.889]  They believe now it's time.
[00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:55.573]  See, a long time ago they said that 2012 was when the UN would come up to its full power and be accepted by the world.
[00:37:55.613 --> 00:38:00.555]  They think it's now ready to be accepted by the various populaces of the world.
[00:38:02.426 --> 00:38:03.366]  They're almost right.
[00:38:03.426 --> 00:38:06.747]  Most countries will go along because they're so beaten down by everything.
[00:38:07.167 --> 00:38:08.988]  They probably will just go along with it.
[00:38:09.228 --> 00:38:10.508]  In fact, they'll think, what can we do?
[00:38:10.548 --> 00:38:12.749]  We haven't protested anything for years.
[00:38:13.449 --> 00:38:16.590]  Most countries have not protested anything for years.
[00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:21.011]  So they've been trained to comply and comply and comply.
[00:38:21.071 --> 00:38:24.572]  So at the top, they do believe they're ready to accept.
[00:38:26.064 --> 00:38:26.544]  You're right.
[00:38:26.625 --> 00:38:33.910]  And Alan, now suddenly, as you know, on CNN, Fox, they're going, the Japanese are looking at putting lithium in the water, an anti-psychotic.
[00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.793]  And the lady on the show says, I think it's a good idea.
[00:38:37.173 --> 00:38:41.516]  And suddenly they're going, yeah, we are going to put statins in the water in Prozac.
[00:38:41.576 --> 00:38:45.619]  And yeah, Prozac is in water supplies that don't have runoff that it shouldn't be.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.461]  Yes, it's going to make you feel better.
[00:38:47.821 --> 00:38:48.382]  They're just
[00:38:48.962 --> 00:38:52.703]  They're just titrating the does, for those that don't know, to get used to, say, cobra bites.
[00:38:53.043 --> 00:38:55.443]  They give people small amounts of the venom and build it up.
[00:38:56.003 --> 00:38:58.504]  And I believe that's why they let Ventura have the TV show.
[00:38:58.564 --> 00:38:59.824]  He means well, I mean well.
[00:39:00.044 --> 00:39:01.865]  But they believe it's now time to throw it in your face.
[00:39:02.305 --> 00:39:05.545]  That's why they're not too worried about me, because they believe it's now time to throw it in your face.
[00:39:06.026 --> 00:39:12.507]  I just want to ask the controllers and the bureaucrats that get petty power out of this, who are compartmentalized, do you like giving your kids
[00:39:12.987 --> 00:39:17.609]  Tap water, in some cases over 300 deadly chemicals, but on average 150 plus.
[00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:23.311]  Do you like the fact that your boys are effeminate, and a lot of them don't even have a sperm count by the time they're 20?
[00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:25.632]  Do you like the fact that everybody's dying of cancer?
[00:39:25.692 --> 00:39:26.972]  I mean, do you really like this?
[00:39:27.012 --> 00:39:28.673]  But see, it's a psychological trick.
[00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:31.554]  They get off on the fact that they feel like they're part of it.
[00:39:32.955 --> 00:39:35.396]  And they also, most people, go into denial.
[00:39:35.436 --> 00:39:36.236]  They cannot believe.
[00:39:37.051 --> 00:39:42.494]  That the masters above them would be so bad as to actually do this deliberately.
[00:39:43.074 --> 00:39:48.097]  In fact, the masters count on the public saying, well, they're always screwing up.
[00:39:48.177 --> 00:39:49.257]  It's got to be a mistake.
[00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:51.518]  They wouldn't have meant to do that.
[00:39:52.018 --> 00:40:05.105]  And of course, they did mean to do that, because Julian Huxley said in the 1950s, and he was the first CEO of UNESCO, he said, we shall use all kinds of pharma in drinking water, food and in inoculations.
[00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.875]  You've created a compliant pliable.
[00:40:08.971 --> 00:40:27.175]  At an endgame 1.5, we have Dr. Michael Kaufman reading from official Pentagon sanctioned studies of what they would do by the year 2000 from the 60s, and these are major universities saying, we will hype the sports up for everybody, we will start drugging everyone with the Soma-type drugs we're developing.
[00:40:27.855 --> 00:40:36.837]  They said we will then start breaking up the families, and everyone will be literally like childlike people, and then we can start reducing their numbers.
[00:40:36.857 --> 00:40:38.097]  So they're just getting everyone ready,
[00:40:38.917 --> 00:40:41.198]  To where, oh yeah, everybody on the block's dying of cancer.
[00:40:41.218 --> 00:40:42.278]  Well, I guess I'm dying.
[00:40:42.318 --> 00:40:43.378]  I love the government.
[00:40:43.759 --> 00:40:46.699]  And the newscasters are, cold is coming tomorrow.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.580]  Be sure and wear your mittens and your hat.
[00:40:50.221 --> 00:40:54.062]  And they talk to you, I heard it on the news this morning, like you're a baby.
[00:40:54.362 --> 00:40:57.143]  And the average person kind of, oh, I like the government.
[00:40:57.783 --> 00:41:03.425]  And everybody kind of ninnies and is real soft and loves tattling and loves, oh, I got cancer.
[00:41:03.505 --> 00:41:04.705]  Oh, good, I love the government.
[00:41:04.965 --> 00:41:06.185]  I mean, it's just so sick!
[00:41:06.606 --> 00:41:07.486]  It's so sick!
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.082]  And it's all planned this way, and implemented by scientific means, yeah.
[00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:15.984]  Oh, Alan, what do we do, man?
[00:41:16.084 --> 00:41:19.445]  I mean, I am never going to be able to take my kids on a flight, which is what they want.
[00:41:19.465 --> 00:41:22.427]  They want us to stop traveling, but I can't let a naked body scan my children.
[00:41:22.667 --> 00:41:24.068]  Well, they even want to do it, coming in.
[00:41:24.108 --> 00:41:26.008]  Now they say they're going to have checkpoints on the highways!
[00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:27.109]  You won't be able to run from it!
[00:41:27.389 --> 00:41:27.909]  I'm sorry!
[00:41:27.929 --> 00:41:28.650]  Go ahead!
[00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:29.650]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:37.534]  They're talking about coming in at the major crossovers of the Canadian borders, so you can't even drive across now without going through the checkpoints.
[00:41:38.675 --> 00:41:40.256]  They interrogate my people.
[00:41:40.296 --> 00:41:44.397]  They make them have proof of the cameras they have with purchases, purchase proof.
[00:41:44.817 --> 00:41:45.937]  They harass everyone.
[00:41:45.977 --> 00:41:47.138]  They take your laptops.
[00:41:47.178 --> 00:41:48.718]  I mean, it's just, it's, it's unbelievable.
[00:41:48.738 --> 00:41:49.158]  Yeah.
[00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:53.380]  This is what totalitarian society happens to be.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:53.960]  We're in it.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.661]  See, people got to realize we're in a totalitarian society.
[00:41:57.941 --> 00:41:59.041]  Didn't happen by chance.
[00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:00.362]  It was planned a long time ago.
[00:42:01.281 --> 00:42:07.106]  Well, the total proof of that is their own documents, but look how it's the same system worldwide, run by the same companies.
[00:42:07.706 --> 00:42:09.728]  And what they did, though, is they were smart here.
[00:42:09.768 --> 00:42:12.210]  They built the grid, and now they're launching it.
[00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:16.833]  They lined up all their cannons and weapons aimed at us, got us ready, and then just started blasting.
[00:42:16.853 --> 00:42:17.674]  What, about a year ago?
[00:42:20.512 --> 00:42:20.992]  I don't
[00:42:40.618 --> 00:42:42.219]  And that brings me to the next thing.
[00:42:42.899 --> 00:42:50.804]  By the time I left high school, they would bring you in under a federal program and have you answer all these psychological questions so the feds could decide what type of worker bee you should be.
[00:42:50.844 --> 00:42:51.204]  Stay there.
[00:42:52.933 --> 00:43:00.417]  Aaron Aqua dot com is your one stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:43:00.437 --> 00:43:04.739]  Aaron Aqua dot com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water.
[00:43:04.959 --> 00:43:08.941]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:13.803]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:43:14.023 --> 00:43:17.685]  Aaron Aqua dot com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:43:17.705 --> 00:43:22.087]  Aaron Aqua dot com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:22.947]  We're good to go!
[00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:57.807]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:43:58.207 --> 00:44:01.193]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:01.434 --> 00:44:02.857]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:03.556 --> 00:44:06.237]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:06.697 --> 00:44:12.419]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:17.661]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:18.161 --> 00:44:27.784]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:27.904 --> 00:44:30.025]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:30.265 --> 00:44:31.586]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:31.846 --> 00:44:34.127]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:34.307 --> 00:44:36.148]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:36.428 --> 00:44:41.231]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:41.591 --> 00:44:50.695]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:52.714 --> 00:45:01.121]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:45:14.512 --> 00:45:17.776]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:45:17.916 --> 00:45:20.158]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:45:26.945 --> 00:45:30.268]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[00:45:52.767 --> 00:45:53.367]  What do you think of this?
[00:45:53.387 --> 00:46:00.633]  The parents of four Montgomery County children under arrest for failing to register their homeschooled children with the school district seven years ago.
[00:46:01.153 --> 00:46:02.194]  How is this allowed to happen?
[00:46:02.234 --> 00:46:03.135]  Who should be held accountable?
[00:46:03.475 --> 00:46:05.917]  FactFinder Marcin Natal went and got some answers.
[00:46:07.449 --> 00:46:10.371]  Is it fair to say that these four children fell through the cracks?
[00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:16.075]  Well, from what I can gather, it sounds like there was education going on, so I don't know if they really slipped through the cracks.
[00:46:16.455 --> 00:46:21.019]  They didn't fulfill their legal responsibilities to file with the school district to be homeschooled.
[00:46:21.479 --> 00:46:26.843]  And then they go to the police and talk about how horrible the parents are and how, why don't we have home inspections of all homes and...
[00:46:27.603 --> 00:46:29.684]  It's not even illegal to not register your kids.
[00:46:29.764 --> 00:46:30.724]  It's a legalese.
[00:46:30.785 --> 00:46:37.768]  They used the CPS to swear out that they believed it was child endangerment, meaning you have a kid playing with dynamite or something, which they didn't.
[00:46:38.488 --> 00:46:42.390]  So they come and arrest them for a big event, and the media's like, more needs to be done!
[00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:52.975]  You have this Soviet outrage of grabbing the kids and arresting the parents, and showing their mugshots on TV, and then the message from the media is, that's not enough.
[00:46:52.995 --> 00:46:54.856]  Remember, the media is so evil now,
[00:46:55.916 --> 00:46:59.039]  That nationwide they tell you mercury is good for your brain.
[00:46:59.299 --> 00:47:01.841]  I've played that clip probably 150 times.
[00:47:03.002 --> 00:47:05.744]  Go to YouTube, type news says mercury is good for brain.
[00:47:05.764 --> 00:47:06.325]  We'll play it again.
[00:47:06.345 --> 00:47:07.325]  It's only 10 seconds.
[00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:15.592]  I mean, Alan, they are practicing insanity and craziness and we're gonna naked body scan you and we're gonna do this and that to just break our will?
[00:47:15.952 --> 00:47:22.578]  Or is it that people have been raised now with really no will or no mooring and so whatever they're told is good?
[00:47:23.567 --> 00:47:23.887]  You're right.
[00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:24.628]  There's no mooring.
[00:47:24.648 --> 00:47:26.829]  There's no cultural mooring anymore.
[00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.872]  That's why the first big attacks were to destroy all religions.
[00:47:31.352 --> 00:47:32.953]  They give you self-respect.
[00:47:34.534 --> 00:47:35.014]  Destroy that.
[00:47:35.034 --> 00:47:36.135]  They've been very successful.
[00:47:36.175 --> 00:47:39.137]  But then told to play during the 70s, the 60s and 70s.
[00:47:39.177 --> 00:47:39.677]  Just play.
[00:47:39.717 --> 00:47:41.098]  Be eternal children forever.
[00:47:41.138 --> 00:47:42.419]  Don't worry about the big problems.
[00:47:42.439 --> 00:47:43.520]  Just go out and have fun.
[00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:46.862]  And of course now we've been trained that way.
[00:47:46.882 --> 00:47:49.224]  We believe we're perpetual children.
[00:47:49.924 --> 00:47:53.006]  Most folk who are adults today think of themselves
[00:47:54.557 --> 00:47:55.757]  Well, it's an illusion, Alan.
[00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:59.419]  People drive around in their cars, they pay their taxes, they question nothing.
[00:47:59.719 --> 00:48:09.043]  They think the world is a wonderland, and they're just passively going... And every time the cops arrest somebody for no reason, or take their kids, or kill somebody, the victims make excuses for them.
[00:48:09.463 --> 00:48:09.843]  That's right.
[00:48:10.383 --> 00:48:18.966]  But they do know that through all their studies, over the last hundred years, 87% of the public will always believe what they're told by the major media.
[00:48:19.547 --> 00:48:23.108]  They can't hold more than two major crises in their head at the same time.
[00:48:24.148 --> 00:48:29.232]  And then now they're about to pass government controlled health care, but we're all talking about body scanners.
[00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.611]  And so that's how it works.
[00:48:45.631 --> 00:48:49.393]  87% of the public can only hold two major things in their head at once.
[00:48:49.853 --> 00:48:54.055]  And when the third one comes along, they delay the last one and forget it even happened.
[00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:55.896]  So this way you can keep it going from crisis to crisis.
[00:48:55.956 --> 00:48:58.837]  And I want police and military from crisis to crisis.
[00:48:58.857 --> 00:49:03.159]  When you're being brainwashed, now that you've learned these techniques, notice your commanders are doing it.
[00:49:03.439 --> 00:49:08.782]  They're taught this stuff and they think it's neat to be able to shudder minds and control people.
[00:49:09.142 --> 00:49:09.242]  Yes.
[00:49:11.184 --> 00:49:11.504]  Absolutely.
[00:49:11.544 --> 00:49:18.011]  So people really have lost a sense of dignity and self-respect and definitely a common culture.
[00:49:18.051 --> 00:49:23.076]  That was part of the big massive communist move for multiculturalism.
[00:49:23.457 --> 00:49:29.022]  It wasn't to be nice to other cultures, it was to help you destroy your own cohesive majority.
[00:49:29.062 --> 00:49:33.807]  Get rid of all other cultures and replace it with a corporate Borg-Prozac culture.
[00:49:33.827 --> 00:49:34.388]  That's correct.
[00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:38.594]  See, men tend to stand up for their culture.
[00:49:38.615 --> 00:49:40.217]  They stand up for their family.
[00:49:40.697 --> 00:49:45.684]  When you destroy the culture, the traditions, and their family, they have nothing left to stand up for.
[00:49:45.704 --> 00:49:46.785]  They won't fight for anything.
[00:49:47.206 --> 00:49:48.948]  And watching sports and guzzling beer.
[00:49:57.571 --> 00:50:02.674]  Well, Alan, I am so alive, I burn with passion and life and love of liberty and decency and honor.
[00:50:02.774 --> 00:50:12.780]  And Madison Avenue first teaches you, as you said, to feel inadequate, to feel pathetic, so then the system can say, this is what makes you adequate, and that's all the slavery and weakness.
[00:50:13.161 --> 00:50:17.744]  But then the men feel even weaker, so they dive into weakness even more, and are never quenched.
[00:50:18.524 --> 00:50:24.269]  And I just wish people knew the burning, animating fire of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:28.112]  I wish they could feel it flowing in them and through them.
[00:50:28.932 --> 00:50:30.654]  I just want that spirit to rise.
[00:50:32.635 --> 00:50:37.499]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:50:39.761 --> 00:50:41.522]  We're good to go.
[00:50:59.633 --> 00:51:01.934]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:51:34.735 --> 00:51:41.300]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:51:45.323 --> 00:51:47.224]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:47.705 --> 00:51:50.387]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.361]  Ellen, I've analyzed Copenhagen in depth.
[00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:11.882]  It was a 95% failure.
[00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:20.826]  And we forced Gordon Brown, the real ringleader of this, kind of the current head of the circus, to then just come out when it failed.
[00:52:20.846 --> 00:52:23.588]  They couldn't get countries to sign on to the global taxes and controls.
[00:52:24.912 --> 00:52:29.456]  He just said, well, we'll just have the Western world go ahead and start levying the taxes and giving it to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:52:29.476 --> 00:52:33.420]  And we'll go ahead and start monitoring the third world and cutting off their funds if they don't do it.
[00:52:34.001 --> 00:52:35.803]  So openly showing he's a tyrant.
[00:52:37.179 --> 00:52:38.299]  But I am optimistic.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.600]  They are drugging people in the water and food.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.021]  They are dumbing people down.
[00:52:42.061 --> 00:52:44.622]  They are playing us off against each other, those of us that are awake.
[00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:49.564]  But I do see them... Things are not going as well as they wanted.
[00:52:49.604 --> 00:52:50.424]  Now, they readjust.
[00:52:50.464 --> 00:52:51.225]  They never give up.
[00:52:52.245 --> 00:52:55.226]  But I think humanity has a chance of beating this.
[00:52:55.426 --> 00:52:59.668]  Everything they've done is study us to know how to stop us from ever defeating them.
[00:53:00.268 --> 00:53:02.089]  But I really have some hope, Alan.
[00:53:03.496 --> 00:53:07.701]  There's always hope, and it's a matter of, again, never giving up either.
[00:53:07.721 --> 00:53:10.924]  They never give up, so we must never give up.
[00:53:10.944 --> 00:53:15.929]  And every day, new folk tune in to radio shows and listen.
[00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:16.730]  Every day.
[00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:18.672]  And young ones do, too.
[00:53:19.173 --> 00:53:25.420]  And they're the ones who are going to have to take up the brunt and take the cudgel off eventually down the road.
[00:53:26.064 --> 00:53:28.045]  To make sure they have their rights back.
[00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:32.626]  We're only starting off the process and keeping the information alive at the moment.
[00:53:32.947 --> 00:53:35.527]  They'd love to kill the information altogether, but they can't.
[00:53:35.748 --> 00:53:36.108]  Not yet.
[00:53:37.008 --> 00:53:40.609]  For those that don't know, isn't Ocadio a Scottish name for a war club?
[00:53:41.029 --> 00:53:41.229]  Yeah.
[00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:42.430]  Okay, I want to make sure.
[00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.630]  Pick up the club.
[00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:53.534]  Yeah, that's what we've got to do, because we're dealing with, as you say yourself, the most ruthless people at the top that's ever existed.
[00:53:54.201 --> 00:54:01.047]  Who are so cocksure themselves now, they believe they can do whatever they wish to the general population of an entire planet.
[00:54:02.368 --> 00:54:06.872]  To the point of, hey, we're drugging your water and we're going to start testing your blood to make sure you're drinking it.
[00:54:07.132 --> 00:54:13.298]  Yes, and we're already drugging most of the young boys out there that can think and have leadership qualities.
[00:54:13.658 --> 00:54:15.340]  I mean, this is full-scale war.
[00:54:16.781 --> 00:54:20.184]  Thought out a long time ago, as C. Julian Huxley said, we'll use pharma.
[00:54:21.396 --> 00:54:31.583]  And so did Bertrand Russell, he said, we shall look for those with leadership qualities, and if we can't bring them in through scholarships into our system, we'll have to eliminate them.
[00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:32.404]  That's what he said.
[00:54:33.284 --> 00:54:39.368]  Because they couldn't allow people who could convey what's happening to the rest of the people and become leaders.
[00:54:39.429 --> 00:54:41.550]  They'd have to drug them or annihilate them.
[00:54:44.022 --> 00:55:09.296]  You know, I look at old photographs and old film footage of just, like, my grandfathers and people before them, and their eyes, especially their parents, you know, back in the 40s and 50s, they were coming out with small little reel tapes, and we found some and watched them, and just normal people in photos, I mean, their eyes were just burning with luminance and intelligence, and people looked so good, even if they were poor, or dressed scra- I mean, they were
[00:55:09.656 --> 00:55:11.597]  I mean, people just radiated power!
[00:55:11.978 --> 00:55:20.964]  There is no doubt... I mean, they admit the fluoride alone is a deadly toxic chemical that brain damages, makes you obese, attacks all the glands, but they are drugging us en masse.
[00:55:21.324 --> 00:55:21.484]  Yes.
[00:55:22.124 --> 00:55:23.686]  And that was always a big part of it.
[00:55:23.706 --> 00:55:29.209]  The combination of pharma working with the government was written about 60, 70 years ago.
[00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:30.910]  That was always their goal.
[00:55:31.451 --> 00:55:33.392]  A compliant, obedient population.
[00:55:33.832 --> 00:55:34.273]  Absolutely.
[00:55:34.553 --> 00:55:35.594]  Remember that movie THX?
[00:55:39.083 --> 00:55:42.705]  THX 1138, which is a fantastic portrayal.
[00:55:42.725 --> 00:55:43.925]  That's what they're actually planning.
[00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:55.710]  That's by George Lucas, his thesis film with Robert Duvall, based, for those that don't know, based on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, which is actually the plan.
[00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.831]  It is the plan.
[00:55:57.831 --> 00:56:07.155]  It absolutely is the plan, because Aldous Huxley was in on the big think tank meetings with his brother Julian Huxley, both descended from the Darwin clan, by the way.
[00:56:08.007 --> 00:56:11.148]  Well, he gave his last speech before they probably killed him in 62.
[00:56:11.449 --> 00:56:12.909]  He just laid it all out at Berkeley.
[00:56:12.929 --> 00:56:14.030]  He said, this is all the plan.
[00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:14.970]  This is real.
[00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:19.672]  And he said, because we're so smart, you listening in the audience won't even be able to stop him.
[00:56:20.213 --> 00:56:20.573]  That's right.
[00:56:20.613 --> 00:56:31.618]  And it's just a small group of men, very powerful, rich, powerful men with the use of pharmacology and a good plan could literally take over and rule the entire planet to their satisfaction.
[00:56:31.946 --> 00:56:35.970]  Why do you think over 30% of police officers admit that they're on steroids?
[00:56:36.671 --> 00:56:39.013]  They actually need it because they've been gelded.
[00:56:39.033 --> 00:56:43.758]  I want the police who serve this to know, you are being chemically attacked.
[00:56:44.259 --> 00:56:45.580]  Chemically lobotomized.
[00:56:45.961 --> 00:56:47.963]  Why do you serve the New World Order?
[00:56:48.383 --> 00:56:50.866]  Because you're drugged right now and under a trance from television.
[00:56:51.943 --> 00:56:56.184]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:56:56.505 --> 00:56:57.105]  Number one.
[00:56:57.405 --> 00:57:00.566]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:00.826 --> 00:57:01.386]  Number two.
[00:57:01.686 --> 00:57:06.228]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:06.588 --> 00:57:07.028]  It's true.
[00:57:07.328 --> 00:57:11.870]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.730]  Number 3.
[00:57:13.011 --> 00:57:16.292]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:16.593 --> 00:57:20.335]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:20.515 --> 00:57:21.075]  Number 4.
[00:57:21.315 --> 00:57:23.677]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:24.077 --> 00:57:27.459]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:27.759 --> 00:57:27.959]  Number 5.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.462]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:37.385]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:57:54.117 --> 00:57:57.799]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:01.162]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:01.382 --> 00:58:02.803]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:58:03.507 --> 00:58:06.190]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:12.395]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:58:12.576 --> 00:58:17.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:58:17.761 --> 00:58:27.750]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:29.952]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:58:30.212 --> 00:58:31.533]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:58:31.793 --> 00:58:34.075]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:58:34.256 --> 00:58:36.117]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:58:36.377 --> 00:58:41.182]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:53.150]  Hi, everyone.
[00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:54.191]  Andy Anderson here.
[00:58:54.391 --> 00:58:58.636]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:58:58.797 --> 00:59:04.463]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:59:04.584 --> 00:59:08.849]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[00:59:08.949 --> 00:59:10.631]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:59:10.771 --> 00:59:11.952]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:16.476]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.

[00:59:57.208 --> 00:59:57.848]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.509 --> 00:59:59.549]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.390]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.851]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.631 --> 01:00:04.552]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.192 --> 01:00:08.834]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.374 --> 01:00:13.416]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:23.392]  Alright, I said I'd take calls today when Alan Watt was on with us.
[01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:29.233]  We're going to open the phones up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:29.273 --> 01:00:32.594]  Dustin in PA, Justin in Montana, Mark in Maui.
[01:00:33.334 --> 01:00:35.055]  Wish I was there, but I can't ever fly there.
[01:00:35.075 --> 01:00:36.335]  I'm not going to be naked body scanned.
[01:00:36.355 --> 01:00:39.396]  No, I'm going to still fly, but I'm not going to let them scan me.
[01:00:39.876 --> 01:00:41.176]  Ken in Mass and others.
[01:00:41.536 --> 01:00:42.597]  What do you think you're doing?
[01:00:42.837 --> 01:00:44.477]  Because you're giving authority and a tin badge?
[01:00:44.497 --> 01:00:45.917]  You're going to put me in a naked body scanner?
[01:00:46.098 --> 01:00:47.598]  They wouldn't even scan Iraqis with?
[01:00:49.841 --> 01:00:52.165]  And I was talking to a man, Kyle Muller, on his syndicated show.
[01:00:52.245 --> 01:00:54.288]  They tried to do a bunch of stuff to him.
[01:00:56.832 --> 01:01:01.019]  The TSA guy marched up and started going, mm, mm, mm, with his wife and children.
[01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:02.221]  And he said, talk to me.
[01:01:02.281 --> 01:01:02.982]  The guy said, mm.
[01:01:04.179 --> 01:01:05.260]  And he said, talk to me.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.122]  And the guy said, that's it, you're missing your flight.
[01:01:07.342 --> 01:01:12.646]  I want you to put that book, he had Atlas shrugged in his hand, on the scanner, through the thing.
[01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:15.968]  And he said, put him in the box, put him in there, and they were like, you're missing your flight.
[01:01:16.249 --> 01:01:19.251]  So he started yelling, this is a police state, this is wrong, this is a fraud.
[01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:20.652]  And they said, get out of here, get out of here.
[01:01:20.912 --> 01:01:22.534]  They didn't want to scare the other slaves.
[01:01:22.574 --> 01:01:25.736]  They want to see you dominated, but not see you stand up.
[01:01:25.996 --> 01:01:26.517]  How and what?
[01:01:27.295 --> 01:01:28.376]  Oh, that's absolutely true.
[01:01:29.097 --> 01:01:37.665]  The last thing you want is to make a coherent, accurate statement and shouting out to the rest of the public what's actually happening.
[01:01:38.285 --> 01:01:43.751]  You've got to shout out sometimes and break the spell and tell them what is actually happening here.
[01:01:45.212 --> 01:01:47.714]  And make them indignant and afraid.
[01:01:48.155 --> 01:01:51.478]  I've also noticed, I want your comment on this, at Disneyland or at
[01:01:53.849 --> 01:01:57.852]  At all the other major theme parks, things like SeaWorld.
[01:01:58.572 --> 01:02:04.196]  You pay for your ticket, and then you walk up and they go, oh, you have to hand print with that ticket you bought.
[01:02:04.436 --> 01:02:06.978]  And then I refuse and they let me through as soon as I start yelling.
[01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.400]  And everyone else, it's the same thing at the airport.
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.682]  You buy your ticket, you go through and they go, body scanner, put your kids in there.
[01:02:15.463 --> 01:02:22.308]  And all these photos on the news, we were showing them yesterday, when they put these women in the scanners, it shows the guys smiling, looking at their naked bodies.
[01:02:24.531 --> 01:02:26.552]  Because that humiliation is important.
[01:02:27.632 --> 01:02:27.812]  Yes.
[01:02:28.873 --> 01:02:29.293]  Absolutely.
[01:02:29.573 --> 01:02:30.773]  And there's no doubt about it.
[01:02:30.853 --> 01:02:32.574]  They already see themselves.
[01:02:32.614 --> 01:02:34.955]  They can't keep anything secret that's on the net.
[01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:43.278]  They've had so many scandals in Britain with social security numbers being sold by the millions from the government to private companies.
[01:02:43.658 --> 01:02:44.358]  You can believe you me.
[01:02:44.378 --> 01:02:51.961]  They're going to have the next big thing that's going to be porn or new porn across the internet worldwide of everybody's body scanner
[01:02:53.277 --> 01:02:53.397]  Yeah.
[01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:53.717]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:53.797 --> 01:02:54.058]  Yeah.
[01:03:10.067 --> 01:03:20.534]  Any rationale meaning of sex itself, or even the fact that sexual bonding between two people used to mean a good, healthy family would come out of it.
[01:03:20.594 --> 01:03:28.879]  Now, not the promiscuity you have today, and it's all taken so lightly on television with the reality shows, which is all about that.
[01:03:28.959 --> 01:03:30.780]  No bonding at all, just have sex.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.842]  So that's why they're hitting the public now with this.
[01:03:34.142 --> 01:03:35.883]  They've degraded the public from the last
[01:03:36.243 --> 01:03:36.523]  Absolutely.
[01:03:36.543 --> 01:03:39.805]  And that's again what they said it has to do a long time ago.
[01:03:39.845 --> 01:03:46.308]  If we can get the children separated from the parents through scientific indoctrination from kindergarten onwards, that their minds are ours.
[01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:06.852]  But then if you try to homeschool your kids, they come and arrest you now with trumped-up, made-up stuff.
[01:04:07.312 --> 01:04:16.496]  Well, in the Italian newspapers a few months ago, the Prime Minister of Italy said there's an outright ban now on all homeschooling.
[01:04:16.876 --> 01:04:21.998]  He said the reason is, he says, every child must have the exact same indoctrination.
[01:04:22.218 --> 01:04:22.918]  Those were the words.
[01:04:24.079 --> 01:04:26.340]  Yeah, here they call it socialization.
[01:04:28.356 --> 01:04:52.443]  And anyone that doubts that, that standardized programming they're being given so they can have their social control, California two years ago had their court rule, it got overturned in a federal court, and we read it here on air, it said the state actually owns your children, you're not allowed to homeschool.
[01:04:54.025 --> 01:04:54.325]  That's right.
[01:04:54.585 --> 01:05:02.450]  And Hillary Clinton, too, ran on that ticket as well, that she would abolish all homeschooling, as there must be for all the big top communists.
[01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:14.178]  I'll loosely call them communists for the world, to bring in the system of standardized... It would be better that your children get no education at all than to be put in public schools.
[01:05:14.218 --> 01:05:14.518]  Go ahead.
[01:05:15.054 --> 01:05:31.805]  Absolutely, because again, for the wonderful utopia of socialism and a passive society, the children all must parrot the same things, all believe the same things, or having sex with an animal is good, and all this is coming up.
[01:05:32.445 --> 01:05:33.906]  And take three years ago.
[01:05:33.926 --> 01:05:36.408]  The New Freedom Initiative got leaked.
[01:05:37.108 --> 01:05:38.608]  Bush signed it four years ago.
[01:05:39.108 --> 01:05:41.749]  The internal documents from the federal board came out.
[01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:48.290]  This was in the Associated Press, but like it was a good thing, they said, we've got 20% of kids on government-issued drugs now.
[01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:51.491]  By 2015, we want 50% and then in the decade after that, 100% on drugs.
[01:05:51.511 --> 01:05:52.491]  100% with forced inoculations.
[01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:53.252]  100% on the drugs.
[01:05:53.272 --> 01:05:54.112]  And those drugs will be for life.
[01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:11.726]  So you have a whole generation on drugs for life, just like the movie we mentioned, the THX movie, just like that.
[01:06:12.226 --> 01:06:21.092]  And you'll get put into a workplace, you'll be tested for your urine all day long, you'll get blood tests to make sure you've taken all your proper drugs and medications, there'll be punishments if you haven't.
[01:06:21.632 --> 01:06:22.873]  And that will become normal.
[01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:38.767]  And what's sick about it is you read UN and government documents that we've covered in detail here, there's literally thousands of them, and then everybody kept saying I should see the movie Equilibrium, and I saw it, and that's actually what they're setting up!
[01:06:40.048 --> 01:06:43.051]  They just throw in our faces what they're doing!
[01:06:43.071 --> 01:06:46.634]  Yeah, it's also predictive programming because
[01:06:48.056 --> 01:07:02.599]  Predictive programming is a strange thing because when you're being entertained you don't realize you're also being indoctrinated with an idea and you're not passing judgment while you're watching entertainment because the sensor part of your brain is not involved.
[01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:13.822]  So therefore it stays in your subconscious and then when you hear it's coming out into reality they're actually going to do this, it's familiar to you and therefore it's not such a big deal that you go along with it.
[01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:14.562]  That's the predictive
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:21.782]  We know 40 years ago they had these passive MRI body scanners and now they're saying we've got to scan into your body.
[01:07:21.802 --> 01:07:25.564]  It took them two days to do that after I said they would because that's their program.
[01:07:25.924 --> 01:07:36.968]  Remember Total Recall with Schwarzenegger and all these other science fiction movies where when you go to the airport men in black ski masks run you through a system that scans your naked body.
[01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.449]  Yeah.
[01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.890]  Oh yeah.
[01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:42.131]  And the book that it came from was written in 1966.
[01:07:45.996 --> 01:07:47.036]  I just can't believe.
[01:07:47.056 --> 01:07:50.098]  I mean, I knew it was going to happen.
[01:07:50.158 --> 01:07:51.478]  I knew it would start accelerating.
[01:07:51.498 --> 01:07:56.541]  But, Alan, do you ever just pinch yourself to witness it and to know this is just the beginning?
[01:07:57.821 --> 01:08:00.042]  I'm never shocked, to be honest with you.
[01:08:00.402 --> 01:08:01.923]  I know what's to come up.
[01:08:01.983 --> 01:08:06.205]  I know the next 50 stages is to come up in the next 20 years.
[01:08:07.365 --> 01:08:08.386]  So I'm never shocked.
[01:08:08.466 --> 01:08:10.447]  I read their books.
[01:08:10.547 --> 01:08:11.327]  I know how they work.
[01:08:12.006 --> 01:08:13.709]  I just can't believe how pathetic the public are.
[01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:33.689]  87% never really disbelieve the major media.
[01:08:33.729 --> 01:08:35.130]  They never question the whys.
[01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:37.252]  They believe government's telling them the truth.
[01:08:37.772 --> 01:08:41.775]  They can't believe that big lies are told to get us into wars and stuff.
[01:08:41.795 --> 01:08:43.076]  That's just too big a lie.
[01:08:43.256 --> 01:08:44.117]  So it must be true.
[01:08:45.658 --> 01:08:47.759]  And those are the ones they concentrate on.
[01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:49.881]  That's why they picked, by the way, democracy.
[01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:52.162]  Democracy is not ruled by the mob.
[01:08:52.182 --> 01:08:57.446]  It's that the mob will always be easily conditioned by the minority who rule.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.602]  Alan, go over the next several phases.
[01:09:03.763 --> 01:09:08.866]  Well, the Copenhagen Agreement, what they agreed to was the most important thing of all.
[01:09:09.286 --> 01:09:10.967]  And I knew that they would, and I mentioned it.
[01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:17.731]  I said they'll agree to agree to the next phases of the upgraded Copenhagen Agreement.
[01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:19.712]  And then leave it nebulous so they can do whatever they wanted?
[01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:21.413]  It's a blank board.
[01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:25.656]  They can go in there and now, and they've all agreed to sign on to whatever is put on that.
[01:09:26.076 --> 01:09:26.556]  And they will.
[01:09:26.736 --> 01:09:28.017]  That's what it's about, yeah.
[01:09:30.342 --> 01:09:35.989]  But we are forcing them to not have everybody sign on to it so it's illustrated that it's pure tyranny.
[01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:50.265]  Yes, as long as it's noted somewhere in the history books there are protesters with another view on all of this and you can cohesively put their view over in a good format, then that goes down
[01:09:51.543 --> 01:09:54.724]  Notice how with the Green Tyranny, they always try to make it unified.
[01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:55.905]  Everyone agrees.
[01:09:56.345 --> 01:09:57.445]  No one disagreed.
[01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.466]  Not one scientist disagreed.
[01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:01.847]  And it's just an all-or-nothing lie.
[01:10:02.247 --> 01:10:14.032]  Yeah, the science is settled, said Al Gore, which is the most unscientific statement you could make, because science must always go over the previous findings and constantly dissect it, retry it.
[01:10:14.712 --> 01:10:19.995]  So it's all a political communist ploy, using an excuse to get communism through.
[01:10:20.535 --> 01:10:21.015]  That's what it is.
[01:10:23.806 --> 01:10:30.221]  Remember at the Reeves Commission they said their job was for the foundations with all their thousands of NGOs was to
[01:10:31.334 --> 01:10:37.916]  They've altered the culture so drastically in the Western world, they've blended seamlessly with that of the Soviet Union.
[01:10:38.357 --> 01:10:42.358]  Well, that's what it's all about, but they can't see we're going along with communism now.
[01:10:42.818 --> 01:10:55.302]  So they use different names for different parts of it, but it's the same agenda, a socialist system worldwide, with experts running the world, and all the lesser ones doing what they're told, with obedience.
[01:10:55.643 --> 01:10:56.603]  That's what they're bringing in.
[01:10:58.394 --> 01:11:06.917]  Oh, it's unbelievable, Alan.
[01:11:11.079 --> 01:11:15.981]  I'm going to come back and take calls for the balance of the 40 minutes we have left with you.
[01:11:17.562 --> 01:11:26.146]  It just hurts me at a primitive level, because I have this defense mechanism for innocence, to watch them arresting homeschooling parents now for no reason in America.
[01:11:31.355 --> 01:11:31.535]  Yeah.
[01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:32.956]  We have fallen so far.
[01:11:32.976 --> 01:11:35.058]  The U.S.
[01:11:35.138 --> 01:11:41.082]  was the last country in the world that had strong family units, and they're demolishing it right now.
[01:11:42.143 --> 01:11:45.785]  They're outlawing it, and they take the rebellion of the children and turn it against the parents?
[01:11:46.906 --> 01:11:47.527]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:52.614 --> 01:11:53.835]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.438]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:11:56.778 --> 01:11:59.801]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:12:00.341 --> 01:12:04.565]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:12:05.106 --> 01:12:10.271]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:12:10.851 --> 01:12:15.094]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[01:12:15.354 --> 01:12:21.377]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[01:12:21.797 --> 01:12:23.038]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[01:12:23.438 --> 01:12:29.542]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[01:12:29.922 --> 01:12:31.563]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[01:12:31.963 --> 01:12:36.987]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[01:12:37.307 --> 01:12:39.909]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[01:12:40.209 --> 01:12:42.331]  Call 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:12:42.631 --> 01:12:44.672]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:12:45.013 --> 01:12:50.997]  Or visit zeolife.net and oxysilver.net and order your free report and package special.
[01:12:52.987 --> 01:12:56.634]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:12:57.014 --> 01:13:00.020]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.683]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:13:02.392 --> 01:13:05.033]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:05.053 --> 01:13:11.275]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:11.435 --> 01:13:16.477]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:26.621]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:26.721 --> 01:13:28.843]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:29.083 --> 01:13:30.405]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:30.665 --> 01:13:32.967]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:33.127 --> 01:13:34.989]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:35.249 --> 01:13:40.054]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:13:40.414 --> 01:13:45.199]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:13:45.419 --> 01:13:49.523]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:51.411 --> 01:13:51.771]  Good day.
[01:13:51.991 --> 01:13:53.492]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:13:53.652 --> 01:13:54.053]  January 6, 2010.
[01:13:54.113 --> 01:13:54.973]  Gold opened this morning at $1126.70.
[01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:58.395]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1157.39, $578.70 for a half-ounce, or $289.35 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:13:58.415 --> 01:13:59.015]  That's $1157.39, $578.70, and $289.35.
[01:14:11.443 --> 01:14:24.935]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:14:25.055 --> 01:14:33.643]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:14:33.883 --> 01:14:34.864]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:14:34.984 --> 01:14:39.127]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:14:39.347 --> 01:14:40.348]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:40.428 --> 01:14:42.249]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:14:42.289 --> 01:14:42.509]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:42.529 --> 01:14:42.829]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:14:51.573 --> 01:14:58.419]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:14:58.559 --> 01:14:59.801]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:14:59.821 --> 01:15:00.501]  It's very real.
[01:15:00.641 --> 01:15:04.405]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:15:04.545 --> 01:15:08.889]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:15:09.009 --> 01:15:11.411]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:17.337]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:15:17.637 --> 01:15:22.319]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:15:22.379 --> 01:15:25.120]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.822]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:15:27.922 --> 01:15:35.105]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:15:35.385 --> 01:15:39.107]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:15:39.127 --> 01:15:39.327]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:15:43.829 --> 01:15:50.131]  We're going to Dustin, Justin, Mark, Ken, and others in just one moment.
[01:15:50.151 --> 01:15:57.592]  For the balance of the hour, taking your phone calls and getting some other news.
[01:16:13.086 --> 01:16:15.707]  But I want to lay it out there.
[01:16:16.248 --> 01:16:24.792]  Joseph McCarthy, the Russians have now declassified it a decade ago, was absolutely right about everything, to a certain point.
[01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:33.017]  As soon as he found out the Pentagon was running the Communists, which has now been declassified, funding them, he was destroyed.
[01:16:33.897 --> 01:16:38.400]  As soon as he found out big financiers were running it to consolidate power, to socialize our wealth.
[01:16:39.639 --> 01:16:51.085]  We need to realize we are up against a conspiracy of parasites and control freaks and compartmentalized crooks that the social engineers hire and roll out their programs through Federal Reserve money worldwide.
[01:16:51.465 --> 01:16:52.225]  They have unlimited money.
[01:16:53.046 --> 01:16:58.488]  And really start recognizing when somebody wants to interrogate your kids, they're a hardcore anti-American piece of trash.
[01:16:59.168 --> 01:17:01.570]  When somebody wants to force drug you, they're your enemy!
[01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:03.711]  Not just, oh, the government's out of control.
[01:17:04.642 --> 01:17:09.486]  We need to gut up and start letting these people know, we know you're criminals, and let their minions know they're criminals.
[01:17:10.907 --> 01:17:13.189]  And they're all engaged in crime.
[01:17:13.369 --> 01:17:14.750]  They all are immoral.
[01:17:15.371 --> 01:17:18.894]  You track a corrupt mayor, a corrupt judge, you're going to find them doing crimes.
[01:17:18.974 --> 01:17:20.415]  Put it on YouTube, burn them!
[01:17:21.256 --> 01:17:25.900]  I mean, folks, if you activate a secret operative against the New World Order, there's no orders.
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.382]  You know evil, you know corruption, engage them!
[01:17:29.502 --> 01:17:30.704]  Turn yourselves loose!
[01:17:31.545 --> 01:17:33.107]  Look what I've done in 14 years.
[01:17:33.488 --> 01:17:34.629]  Devastating the enemy!
[01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:36.212]  Devastating the enemy!
[01:17:36.532 --> 01:17:38.515]  And I'm only one person with one operation.
[01:17:38.836 --> 01:17:41.179]  You can all activate and do things untold.
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:42.541]  The enemy
[01:17:43.786 --> 01:17:44.987]  Operates covertly.
[01:17:45.507 --> 01:17:48.990]  You can operate overtly, covertly, there's so many ways to beat them.
[01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:59.118]  But when you realize you're in a scientific dictatorship, you're fighting for your very future, they're already poisoning people en masse, we're in the middle of just absolute war, as Alan Watt was saying.
[01:17:59.198 --> 01:17:59.438]  Alan?
[01:18:00.379 --> 01:18:11.908]  Yes, and hopefully one day down the road, the biggest Nuremberg trial ever, ever put on in history, where all these characters will pay for their crimes against humanity.
[01:18:13.792 --> 01:18:21.177]  And public service announcements will be educating people in sophisticated propaganda so they know how to recognize scumbag lying and manipulation.
[01:18:22.258 --> 01:18:26.901]  I really think the signs and symptoms of the psychopath should be taught in school.
[01:18:29.143 --> 01:18:31.284]  Because these are the type who go up into these positions.
[01:18:31.324 --> 01:18:32.405]  They get into the Pentagon.
[01:18:32.805 --> 01:18:34.446]  They get up the ranks of business.
[01:18:34.526 --> 01:18:36.007]  They get up the ranks of politics.
[01:18:36.668 --> 01:18:41.191]  They have an insatiable craving for utter, complete power.
[01:18:41.932 --> 01:18:44.472]  And there are definite signs and symptoms with them.
[01:18:44.512 --> 01:18:47.393]  They're totally corruptible because they have no right or wrongs within them.
[01:18:48.053 --> 01:18:50.754]  Whatever is right simply benefits them.
[01:18:51.994 --> 01:18:53.794]  But we've got to expose them for who they are.
[01:18:54.154 --> 01:18:58.935]  And they're obsessed with the science of control that they spend trillions studying.
[01:18:59.295 --> 01:19:00.255]  Yes.
[01:19:00.395 --> 01:19:04.856]  And you're quite correct though when you say that they want to drug your children and so on.
[01:19:05.376 --> 01:19:08.197]  It's the same as coming to kill your children.
[01:19:08.237 --> 01:19:10.317]  They're coming to destroy the brain of your child.
[01:19:12.254 --> 01:19:14.495]  Their soul, their destiny, their will.
[01:19:14.595 --> 01:19:15.555]  Yeah.
[01:19:15.675 --> 01:19:19.896]  Then you're dealing with murderers here, and they must be treated as murderers.
[01:19:19.936 --> 01:19:23.956]  Don't lose what they're really doing through scientific... Exactly.
[01:19:24.496 --> 01:19:28.897]  I think the biggest awakening, Alan, is realizing, I mean, I'm a normal person.
[01:19:29.257 --> 01:19:39.019]  I'm a normal, red-blooded, aggressive person who isn't stupid, but I'm not that smart, and when I read scientific manuals on how they're attacking everyone, I start warning people, what are you supposed to do?
[01:19:41.838 --> 01:19:43.841]  And it's got to be a mass movement.
[01:19:43.861 --> 01:19:45.543]  It's got to be a mass movement, grassroots.
[01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:02.489]  Oh yeah, lots of them are out of the loop.
[01:20:02.509 --> 01:20:07.714]  They don't have to be in the loop and a lot of them prefer to be out of the loop because they've got plausible deniability.
[01:20:07.754 --> 01:20:11.398]  Their own pockets are getting well feathered and nested.
[01:20:11.959 --> 01:20:16.083]  So they don't care how things are done as long as their name is kept out of it.
[01:20:16.483 --> 01:20:20.748]  But technically one day shall come and they will all answer for their crimes, their massive crimes.
[01:20:21.684 --> 01:20:23.405]  But that's the sick part about the New World Order.
[01:20:23.425 --> 01:20:34.968]  They have this sick logic, dark logic is what I call it, of where they have to warn us about what they're doing, and then they love, statistically, they attack their own mid-level and low-level minions.
[01:20:36.849 --> 01:20:40.752]  Well, you've got to understand the psychopath lives on pure ego, their own ego.
[01:20:40.892 --> 01:20:43.354]  And outside of that ego, nothing really exists.
[01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:06.963]  I've also been told by top globalists that they enjoy hearing about how evil they are.
[01:21:34.451 --> 01:21:35.152]  They love it.
[01:21:35.212 --> 01:21:36.934]  This show is one of their favorite entertainments.
[01:21:38.055 --> 01:21:39.617]  And the public's just, ugh, kill me.
[01:21:39.717 --> 01:21:40.178]  I love it.
[01:21:40.198 --> 01:21:41.800]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:21:42.241 --> 01:21:43.162]  We're on the march.
[01:21:43.642 --> 01:21:45.244]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:46.185 --> 01:21:48.869]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:53.513 --> 01:21:57.134]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:21:57.474 --> 01:22:05.595]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:22:06.335 --> 01:22:10.376]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:22:10.956 --> 01:22:21.778]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:22:22.398 --> 01:22:31.420]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:36.961]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:22:37.342 --> 01:22:44.523]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:22:44.843 --> 01:22:47.584]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:22:53.496 --> 01:22:57.141]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:57.522 --> 01:23:00.526]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:02.189]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:23:02.893 --> 01:23:05.556]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:05.576 --> 01:23:11.761]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:11.962 --> 01:23:16.986]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:23:17.147 --> 01:23:20.310]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:27.136]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:23:27.256 --> 01:23:29.358]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:29.598 --> 01:23:30.919]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:31.179 --> 01:23:33.441]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:35.503]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:35.783 --> 01:23:40.568]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:40.928 --> 01:23:45.692]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:23:52.685 --> 01:23:55.287]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:55.687 --> 01:24:00.671]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:24:01.032 --> 01:24:02.773]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:24:03.073 --> 01:24:07.517]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:24:09.804 --> 01:24:10.705]  We're good.
[01:24:26.243 --> 01:24:26.843]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:55.556]  Out of approval by the FDA.
[01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.901]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[01:24:57.981 --> 01:25:00.646]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:03.953]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[01:25:06.718 --> 01:25:12.679]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:19.581]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:25:19.601 --> 01:25:26.883]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:25:28.641 --> 01:25:30.623]  That was aired nationwide.
[01:25:30.723 --> 01:25:36.669]  That was the local Austin version saying, Mercury's good for your children.
[01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:39.672]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:25:39.732 --> 01:25:40.272]  They are
[01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:54.046]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:25:54.086 --> 01:25:55.047]  Long time, first time.
[01:26:10.348 --> 01:26:15.590]  Um, I was calling in regards to a, uh, well first, I live in a small town in Lancaster, PA of 55,000.
[01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:22.853]  Um, we, uh, recently had over 160 surveillance cameras put into our city.
[01:26:22.873 --> 01:26:37.019]  Um, the LA Times on the June 21st of 09 issue, uh, did an article on us, little old Lancaster and LA, and how, uh, we have public, uh, private companies watching us with our surveillance system.
[01:26:37.319 --> 01:26:39.780]  Um, I do work for the city of Lancaster and, um,
[01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:51.094]  I expected that we would be in charge and ask some questions and nobody knows nothing but yet the government is federally funding over 170 surveillance cameras in our little old city.
[01:26:52.075 --> 01:27:05.200]  And that's to track everybody, every town's getting them, private groups get it, the government then in revolving doors, the private people in government make money as consultants and working for those companies and so of course it's all privatized.
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.301]  They take your tax money and then turn your town into a prison.
[01:27:08.421 --> 01:27:08.901]  Alan Watt.
[01:27:09.855 --> 01:27:10.736]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:27:10.756 --> 01:27:14.318]  A lot of big bucks are passed to the Feds as well to pass it.
[01:27:14.378 --> 01:27:20.082]  It's generally a company or companies from Israel that gets the contract.
[01:27:20.102 --> 01:27:23.384]  So they're heavy lobbyists for the variant company.
[01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:26.046]  They're the ones that put them all throughout Britain as well.
[01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:28.687]  And you're quite right.
[01:27:28.727 --> 01:27:35.312]  The whole idea is to, again, it's got more than, it's not just to track you, it's to get you used to being watched.
[01:27:35.332 --> 01:27:37.013]  It's to alter your behavior.
[01:27:37.748 --> 01:27:40.170]  You're not spontaneous anymore walking down a street.
[01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:43.692]  Even in company, you don't laugh the same, you don't joke the same.
[01:27:43.972 --> 01:27:45.754]  You're always aware you're being watched.
[01:27:46.414 --> 01:27:47.535]  They're above you!
[01:27:47.635 --> 01:27:48.696]  They're the government!
[01:27:48.736 --> 01:27:50.657]  They're the all-seeing God!
[01:27:51.037 --> 01:27:57.042]  Yes, but it actually encourages you to alter your own behavior until you become sovietized.
[01:27:57.082 --> 01:28:01.665]  In the Soviet Union, you didn't look left or right if you walked down the road.
[01:28:01.805 --> 01:28:06.969]  You stared at the sidewalk and didn't make eye contact with anyone because it could be dangerous.
[01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:09.071]  By the way, that's been in the news.
[01:28:09.371 --> 01:28:11.953]  A lot of cops now, if you look at them, they pull over.
[01:28:12.574 --> 01:28:14.015]  You don't look at me, boy!
[01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:15.817]  You think this is America?
[01:28:15.837 --> 01:28:15.897]  Yep.
[01:28:17.278 --> 01:28:17.659]  That's right.
[01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:20.662]  And all the cops, as you know, have been completely militarized.
[01:28:20.682 --> 01:28:21.943]  Same military training.
[01:28:23.024 --> 01:28:26.047]  They're one big brotherhood now on the winning side.
[01:28:26.667 --> 01:28:28.169]  You're now called civilians.
[01:28:28.489 --> 01:28:30.691]  You're not the general public anymore.
[01:28:30.731 --> 01:28:31.552]  You're civilians.
[01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:37.612]  And you're threatening them when you look at them, or stare at them, or even ask them a question, you're very threatening them.
[01:28:38.232 --> 01:28:42.773]  Yeah, a lot of police around the country, oh, excuse me officer, and he's like, do I look like a travel agency?
[01:28:43.173 --> 01:28:43.873]  Get moving!
[01:28:44.253 --> 01:28:45.174]  Pay the taxes!
[01:28:45.194 --> 01:28:51.135]  I mean, it's just like... Oh God, it's so humiliating.
[01:28:51.195 --> 01:28:53.936]  This is what tyranny is, you see, we're living through tyranny.
[01:28:55.737 --> 01:28:56.537]  Living through tyranny.
[01:28:58.197 --> 01:29:00.258]  And then the cops that aren't like that get made fun of.
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:02.701]  Yes, and he'll be out.
[01:29:03.241 --> 01:29:04.562]  If he can't fit in, he'll be out.
[01:29:05.462 --> 01:29:06.423]  Anything else, Dustin?
[01:29:06.443 --> 01:29:10.065]  I mean, why didn't the townspeople vote out the government and remove the stinking cameras?
[01:29:10.825 --> 01:29:11.986]  Yeah, well, that's the thing.
[01:29:12.166 --> 01:29:15.768]  A lot of these people here, now we're in a very diverse city.
[01:29:15.788 --> 01:29:20.371]  They said we were a study for the government, federal government.
[01:29:20.411 --> 01:29:22.052]  They always say it's a study.
[01:29:22.748 --> 01:29:26.230]  Well, they said we're a study to see how effective these cameras are.
[01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:29.092]  Now, there's, uh, these cameras are out there.
[01:29:29.172 --> 01:29:37.098]  The cameras were at an intersection where a female was beaten to death by her boyfriend, but yet they happened to not catch that part on the camera.
[01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:37.598]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:41.140]  They never prosecute any crime with it, because they like the crime.
[01:29:41.821 --> 01:29:46.764]  It's all to suck off the sheep, and they're going to start nationwide taxing you by the miles, sir.
[01:29:47.364 --> 01:29:52.568]  It scans your license plate point to point, and will ticket you, give you speed from point to point.
[01:29:53.589 --> 01:30:05.597]  The guy that they have, I met the guy that's monitoring us in a back room somewhere that's not even on government property, and he looks like one of the slummiest men that you would ever see.
[01:30:07.779 --> 01:30:08.979]  Now who do you think they are?
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:20.648]  It's very scary, and people around here feel like they're being safe, but they don't realize that their whole civil liberties are being ripped out from underneath of them with the blink of an eye.
[01:30:23.308 --> 01:30:23.608]  Go ahead.
[01:30:24.949 --> 01:30:26.790]  Actually, the eye doesn't blink, does it, Alex?
[01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:27.711]  It's always on us.
[01:30:28.191 --> 01:30:29.532]  No, the all-seeing eye doesn't blink.
[01:30:29.572 --> 01:30:30.573]  I appreciate your call.
[01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:34.956]  But then, every time there's a hijacker or a bomber, the cameras don't work.
[01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.097]  That's right, Alan, isn't it?
[01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:41.981]  Yeah, the main purpose, as I say, is to make us alter our behavior.
[01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:46.424]  We have a term at the United Nations for how we start to alter.
[01:30:46.444 --> 01:30:48.125]  I think they call it self-policing.
[01:30:49.065 --> 01:30:59.001]  We police ourselves because we're always being watched and it's almost a subconscious thing that creeps into you and takes over the way that you behave personally.
[01:30:59.021 --> 01:31:01.325]  It's a behavior modification project.
[01:31:04.651 --> 01:31:05.272]  Unbelievable.
[01:31:05.692 --> 01:31:07.293]  Alright, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:31:07.373 --> 01:31:09.775]  You should gorilla shoot video of that.
[01:31:09.795 --> 01:31:14.258]  And then, of course, in your free society, we'll see if you're allowed to in America.
[01:31:14.898 --> 01:31:18.421]  But shoot video of the cameras, interview people, start a YouTube channel.
[01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:20.722]  You don't even have to use your name if you don't want.
[01:31:22.668 --> 01:31:27.869]  I would just come out in the open, and you're right, and start protesting these and try to get the town educated about what's happening.
[01:31:28.489 --> 01:31:37.951]  We sent to Curt Nemo today, it's in color, this is just a scan of it, the army out searching houses, Lexington homes searched in hunt for bank robber.
[01:31:38.391 --> 01:31:42.192]  And they use any excuse to lock down cities, randomly search all the homes.
[01:31:43.472 --> 01:31:47.993]  Someone can be seen with a gun, or they hear a backfire and they lock down parts of the towns.
[01:31:48.453 --> 01:31:51.534]  They're training us that they're the boss to protect us, of course, Alan.
[01:31:52.051 --> 01:31:52.531]  Absolutely.
[01:31:52.671 --> 01:31:52.912]  I know.
[01:31:53.232 --> 01:31:53.452]  I know.
[01:31:54.232 --> 01:32:06.599]  I've seen it happen in Canada, in fact, where a hunter who fired off three rounds every year, just siding in for the hunting season, fired off on his own land in the country.
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.521]  He was opposite me at the time.
[01:32:09.221 --> 01:32:11.202]  And a whole squad of cars just flew in there.
[01:32:11.522 --> 01:32:16.165]  A woman over the hill who'd moved in, a yuppie from the city, had heard the shots.
[01:32:16.485 --> 01:32:19.367]  And in comes the SWAT teams because they heard shots.
[01:32:19.995 --> 01:32:22.797]  And he was firing against a hill, which was his own hill.
[01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:24.158]  He owned it from backstops.
[01:32:24.178 --> 01:32:25.559]  There was no danger to anyone.
[01:32:26.079 --> 01:32:26.959]  Miles from anywhere.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:32.363]  And he went to hell trying to clear himself.
[01:32:32.743 --> 01:32:34.444]  He almost got shot by the SWAT team.
[01:32:36.285 --> 01:32:37.946]  Oh, that happens out in Travis County.
[01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:39.647]  People have their own 30, 40 acres.
[01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:44.490]  They shoot a shotgun and all these people move in from big cities and they start panicking.
[01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.931]  Guns!
[01:32:45.011 --> 01:32:45.351]  Guns!
[01:32:45.411 --> 01:32:48.173]  But when they hear police with guns, they feel safe.
[01:32:49.731 --> 01:33:01.901]  They're brainwashed by television and that's the purpose of all the cop shows and television.
[01:33:02.161 --> 01:33:03.662]  They're not shows, they're not entertainment.
[01:33:03.982 --> 01:33:09.367]  It's propaganda to make you think they're all powerful, always correct, always above board.
[01:33:10.548 --> 01:33:19.756]  It's unbelievable.
[01:33:21.237 --> 01:33:22.858]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[01:33:22.878 --> 01:33:25.000]  I'm trying to hurry through them now.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.582]  Let's talk to Justin in Montana, then Mark in Maui.
[01:33:27.622 --> 01:33:28.243]  Go ahead, Justin.
[01:33:29.364 --> 01:33:29.784]  Hey, Alex.
[01:33:30.124 --> 01:33:32.406]  Allen, thanks for everything you guys do.
[01:33:32.486 --> 01:33:33.768]  I called about two reasons.
[01:33:34.268 --> 01:33:34.768]  One about
[01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:46.915]  The gunpowder and anybody who hunts or owns guns that they should start thinking about reloading and buying powder before they start making it expire.
[01:33:46.995 --> 01:34:05.266]  There's some talk about some powder that... No, the federal government does want to do that and they're openly buying up or shutting down the big gun manufacturers and ammo manufacturers and at the same time they're now teaching realtors that reloading equipment is terrorism and people get the police called on them.
[01:34:06.824 --> 01:34:15.457]  Absolutely, and the second thing was, I was following the story a couple days ago about this unmanned drone that the Houston Police Department is going to be using.
[01:34:15.917 --> 01:34:19.723]  And that they just tested here, I don't know if it was yesterday or the day before yesterday.
[01:34:21.319 --> 01:34:25.083]  Unmanned drones for spying on citizens with high-powered cameras on them.
[01:34:25.883 --> 01:34:32.190]  I think the headline is Unmanned UAV, Houston using unmanned UAV.
[01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:35.133]  Oh yeah, two years ago they got an FAA approval.
[01:34:35.193 --> 01:34:36.614]  That's nationwide.
[01:34:36.934 --> 01:34:40.118]  And they're using CIA spy satellites for the environmentalists now.
[01:34:40.458 --> 01:34:44.322]  If you build a tiny shed on your property, I mean, it's just hell's being released.
[01:34:46.263 --> 01:34:47.564]  Well, it sure sounds like it, Alex.
[01:34:47.664 --> 01:34:49.184]  I just wanted to update you guys about that.
[01:34:49.224 --> 01:34:50.805]  Thanks again for everything you guys do.
[01:34:51.705 --> 01:34:52.206]  Thank you.
[01:34:52.306 --> 01:34:54.227]  And again, they want to bankrupt the economy.
[01:34:54.267 --> 01:34:55.607]  The economic numbers have come in.
[01:34:55.687 --> 01:34:57.848]  Everything is accelerating in its implosion.
[01:34:58.288 --> 01:35:03.031]  And they're just hiring more police, more bureaucrats, more controllers, more harassment, more in-your-face.
[01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:04.611]  I mean, it's incredible, Alan.
[01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:05.171]  Yes.
[01:35:06.072 --> 01:35:10.374]  And now you have all the eco-fees to come on top of every purchase.
[01:35:11.255 --> 01:35:12.275]  We're good to go.
[01:35:38.114 --> 01:35:39.835]  While shutting down new power plants in the U.S.
[01:35:39.875 --> 01:35:41.455]  and moving into China and India?
[01:35:56.601 --> 01:36:08.489]  Yes, and what gets me too is when Maurice Strong, one of the big players of the United Nations in the 1980s, he came in to privatize the electrical system for all of Ontario that was owned supposedly by the public.
[01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:09.810]  He did privatize it.
[01:36:10.090 --> 01:36:15.534]  He said at the time, we're not going to update the can-do reactors that are built in Canada.
[01:36:15.554 --> 01:36:23.739]  He said we're going to let them fall apart and only major corporations will have all these super devices to give them energy for the future.
[01:36:23.979 --> 01:36:26.081]  For the rest of the public, it's just too bad.
[01:36:26.121 --> 01:36:26.561]  We're taking
[01:36:27.161 --> 01:36:41.385]  It's high-tech reservations, government and corporate grids and all of us literally living in total absolute complete poverty with new social services laws where if you're poor they're going to take your kids and it's all being announced.
[01:36:41.745 --> 01:36:44.466]  And also the can-do reactor.
[01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:45.846]  Canada still builds them.
[01:36:46.286 --> 01:36:47.526]  We've bought a whole bunch.
[01:36:47.566 --> 01:36:48.887]  We're building them for China.
[01:36:48.907 --> 01:36:53.588]  We're building them for India and elsewhere but we can't build any for Canada.
[01:36:55.928 --> 01:36:56.688]  Unbelievable.
[01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:58.069]  Let's take another call here.
[01:36:58.109 --> 01:36:58.829]  Thank you, caller.
[01:36:58.869 --> 01:37:01.090]  Let's talk to the caller from Maui.
[01:37:01.450 --> 01:37:02.270]  Mark in Maui.
[01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.690]  Welcome.
[01:37:04.531 --> 01:37:10.793]  In times of change, a patriot is a scarce man, brave, hated, and scorned.
[01:37:11.153 --> 01:37:19.736]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, however, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:37:19.976 --> 01:37:20.757]  Put your flag down.
[01:37:20.837 --> 01:37:20.957]  Come!
[01:37:20.977 --> 01:37:22.817]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:37:23.418 --> 01:37:23.798]  Hey, buddy.
[01:37:23.838 --> 01:37:24.338]  How you doing?
[01:37:25.313 --> 01:37:26.214]  I'm going to keep my shirts.
[01:37:26.294 --> 01:37:27.115]  I thank you for Christmas.
[01:37:27.995 --> 01:37:29.196]  I got a lot of great gifts.
[01:37:29.256 --> 01:37:30.377]  What were the shirts?
[01:37:31.638 --> 01:37:37.863]  My Upside Down, Mayday, Mayday, World Citizen Distress Order, Flip Your Flag for Freedom, Patriots in Distress, Mayday shirt.
[01:37:39.665 --> 01:37:41.266]  I believe we did get some shirts like that.
[01:37:41.286 --> 01:37:45.310]  We got a lot of stuff, but the guys in there are shaking their heads, but I do think I saw those.
[01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.711]  What color are they?
[01:37:48.085 --> 01:37:52.347]  It's a white shirt with blue and red print, and I sent you 12 of them, too, for gifts.
[01:37:52.427 --> 01:37:54.929]  And Ken, you can carry on your story online if you'd like.
[01:37:54.949 --> 01:37:55.789]  Yes, I got it.
[01:37:55.829 --> 01:37:56.189]  Thank you.
[01:37:56.410 --> 01:37:56.690]  Thank you.
[01:37:56.710 --> 01:37:57.790]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:02.993]  President Obama was over here in Hawaii, and they stopped chemtrailing.
[01:38:03.153 --> 01:38:05.394]  And then he left, and they started chemtrailing again.
[01:38:05.414 --> 01:38:06.295]  I can't take it.
[01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:09.096]  We live in the wettest spot in the world, and they're drying up.
[01:38:11.137 --> 01:38:12.578]  Well, Obama loves you.
[01:38:12.798 --> 01:38:13.538]  He's a good man.
[01:38:13.778 --> 01:38:16.480]  He's really our president, and everything's fine.
[01:38:19.898 --> 01:38:21.239]  I appreciate your call, man.
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:23.541]  I tell you, he's fired up.
[01:38:24.762 --> 01:38:25.263]  I tell you.
[01:38:26.224 --> 01:38:30.488]  Let me go ahead and go to the next caller here, calling up my call list.
[01:38:30.948 --> 01:38:32.409]  Let's talk to Ken and Mass.
[01:38:32.429 --> 01:38:33.871]  Ken, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:38:33.891 --> 01:38:34.271]  Go ahead.
[01:38:35.732 --> 01:38:36.553]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:36.773 --> 01:38:37.774]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:38:40.316 --> 01:38:42.078]  I started listening to your show about a month ago.
[01:38:42.098 --> 01:38:45.201]  I'm calling about the body scanners.
[01:38:46.232 --> 01:38:54.841]  I have a compromised immune system because I worked for years in hospitals and universities in Boston and got large doses of radiation without knowing it.
[01:38:55.381 --> 01:38:58.024]  It came down with mild lymphoma about ten years ago.
[01:38:58.902 --> 01:39:00.583]  But that's what I meant by the New World Order.
[01:39:00.603 --> 01:39:02.064]  We have CBS News.
[01:39:02.524 --> 01:39:09.849]  Mainstream tells you that these scanners and similar systems do hurt people and do radiate you.
[01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:13.531]  And the TSA guys, they're all going to love getting testicular cancer.
[01:39:13.711 --> 01:39:16.993]  They're going to love getting cataracts from the radiation.
[01:39:17.293 --> 01:39:21.316]  I mean, that's the sick part, is the system always hurts its minions worse.
[01:39:21.356 --> 01:39:21.736]  Go ahead.
[01:39:22.657 --> 01:39:28.080]  Well, what I did 10 years ago when I got the lymphomas, I went to Dana-Farber, supposedly one of the best hospitals in the world.
[01:39:28.686 --> 01:39:32.608]  And they told me that if I took the chemo every three months, they'd try to keep me alive for five years.
[01:39:33.369 --> 01:39:36.070]  So, uh, I said, I don't want to be sick for five years and die.
[01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:36.890]  I'll skip the chemo.
[01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:37.911]  And now this is 10 years.
[01:39:37.931 --> 01:39:39.272]  I'm still doing pretty good.
[01:39:39.732 --> 01:39:39.932]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:39.952 --> 01:39:41.973]  They would have sucked all the money out of you and killed you.
[01:39:42.013 --> 01:39:42.794]  Yeah, they would, right?
[01:39:42.814 --> 01:39:43.334]  Yep.
[01:39:43.654 --> 01:39:50.678]  And, uh, so now I'm concerned about these, uh, scanners at the, uh, airports because I really can't afford any more radiation.
[01:39:50.738 --> 01:39:58.142]  So what I did this morning is I called Logan Airport and I, security, I called them that because they have a compromised immune system.
[01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:00.314]  I really don't think I can go through these scanners.
[01:40:01.236 --> 01:40:09.707]  And all that they suggested, maybe this is a bad idea, they said if I get a note from my doctor saying I can't go through the scanner, that they would just pat me down instead.
[01:40:10.127 --> 01:40:14.834]  So I said, you know, if the listeners would go to their doctors and just get a note from their doctors,
[01:40:15.692 --> 01:40:17.553]  Yeah, but let me expand on that.
[01:40:17.613 --> 01:40:18.433]  Let me expand on that.
[01:40:18.833 --> 01:40:26.396]  Then, it's not saying it's bad to begin with and violates our privacy and doesn't protect us, and that the Amsterdam airport had the stupid scanners.
[01:40:26.997 --> 01:40:28.617]  That gives into it, though.
[01:40:28.637 --> 01:40:29.638]  But it's an interesting idea.
[01:40:29.658 --> 01:40:31.298]  Alan Watt comments on that.
[01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:33.799]  It's a weird around it.
[01:40:33.819 --> 01:40:36.861]  They did say that anyone who doesn't take it will get patted down.
[01:40:38.653 --> 01:40:48.987]  This also has the added function, when you're scanned, of going along with another part of the agenda, which is complete sterilization of whatever fertility you still have left.
[01:40:49.329 --> 01:40:51.191]  Yeah, we've got 85% or more down.
[01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.051]  They've got to get that last 15%.
[01:40:52.191 --> 01:40:52.632]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.652 --> 01:40:55.114]  And of course, that's not a big crisis.
[01:40:55.674 --> 01:40:57.035]  In fact, I have a magazine in here.
[01:40:57.075 --> 01:40:57.716]  Where did it go?
[01:40:58.376 --> 01:40:59.698]  I see this everywhere.
[01:41:00.098 --> 01:41:01.239]  Falling Fertility.
[01:41:01.259 --> 01:41:02.260]  Give me a close shot, guys.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.521]  Falling Fertility.
[01:41:03.561 --> 01:41:08.365]  How the population problem is solving itself from The Economist magazine.
[01:41:08.985 --> 01:41:12.208]  And then you open it up and it says, oh,
[01:41:14.128 --> 01:41:15.029]  Isn't it wonderful?
[01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:19.653]  Fertility is falling astonishingly fast and that's bringing big benefits.
[01:41:20.354 --> 01:41:25.398]  So they never say why suddenly people can't have kids or how the West is dying.
[01:41:25.438 --> 01:41:26.900]  They say this is wonderful.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:30.643]  A dead, dying culture in the West is good.
[01:41:31.424 --> 01:41:33.466]  Just like shooting yourself in the head is good.
[01:41:33.646 --> 01:41:34.927]  The agenda is working.
[01:41:35.648 --> 01:41:37.830]  But the elites are all obsessed with having 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 children.
[01:41:42.844 --> 01:41:43.444]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:42:12.256 --> 01:42:16.601]  Good, glad to hear you're on the air, airwaves, doing your thing.
[01:42:16.621 --> 01:42:19.203]  I've been listening for about six months now.
[01:42:20.985 --> 01:42:28.293]  Yesterday there was a major development in the Canadian news up here, that they're putting in 44 of these body scanners across the country.
[01:42:29.575 --> 01:42:32.577]  Effective as of, I believe, the 1st of March.
[01:42:32.677 --> 01:42:34.379]  And they'd already pre-ordered them last year.
[01:42:34.459 --> 01:42:35.880]  I have the CTV on that.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.501]  Stay there, we'll come back to you briefly, Steve.
[01:42:37.801 --> 01:42:38.902]  Jam in John and Douglas.
[01:42:39.402 --> 01:42:42.304]  Our guest website is cuttingthemetrix.com.
[01:42:42.744 --> 01:42:45.787]  He's also a big part of Fall of the Republic, my film.
[01:42:45.807 --> 01:42:50.190]  You can order it at infowars.com and get a free t-shirt, but that deal is ending soon.
[01:42:54.453 --> 01:42:55.593]  This is not a drill.
[01:42:55.673 --> 01:42:57.615]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[01:43:00.067 --> 01:43:07.195]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[01:43:07.295 --> 01:43:11.639]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:22.050]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[01:43:22.211 --> 01:43:22.671]  Under any
[01:43:22.691 --> 01:43:23.732]  Any circumstance.
[01:43:23.812 --> 01:43:30.696]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[01:43:31.036 --> 01:43:31.696]  But listen up.
[01:43:31.756 --> 01:43:37.920]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:39.781]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[01:43:39.821 --> 01:43:41.922]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[01:43:42.002 --> 01:43:42.482]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:43:42.502 --> 01:43:45.564]  Before they come for your guns, hideyourguns.com right now.
[01:43:53.524 --> 01:43:57.146]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:57.526 --> 01:44:00.528]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:00.768 --> 01:44:02.189]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:44:02.893 --> 01:44:05.575]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:05.595 --> 01:44:11.800]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:11.961 --> 01:44:17.005]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:17.145 --> 01:44:27.153]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:27.253 --> 01:44:27.914]  Tim Geithner?
[01:44:28.114 --> 01:44:28.574]  Bernanke?
[01:44:28.594 --> 01:44:29.355]  They're arsonists!
[01:44:29.595 --> 01:44:30.936]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:31.196 --> 01:44:33.478]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:33.659 --> 01:44:35.500]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:40.585]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:40.925 --> 01:44:45.709]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:44:52.702 --> 01:44:54.623]  Is your computer running slowly?
[01:44:54.883 --> 01:44:56.304]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[01:44:56.645 --> 01:44:57.685]  Don't waste your money!

[01:45:59.229 --> 01:46:02.031]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:46:04.092 --> 01:46:06.754]  Final segment with Alan Watt, CuttingOfTheMatrix.com.
[01:46:06.814 --> 01:46:10.156]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:46:13.238 --> 01:46:14.039]  Steve in Canada.
[01:46:14.619 --> 01:46:15.140]  I have the
[01:46:16.425 --> 01:46:18.106]  I've got an article here in my stack.
[01:46:18.126 --> 01:46:20.887]  In fact, I forgot to dig around for it during the break.
[01:46:20.927 --> 01:46:21.347]  Here it is.
[01:46:21.407 --> 01:46:24.449]  Give me a close shot of this, guys, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:46:25.029 --> 01:46:29.031]  The headline from CTV, that's the big TV station in Canada, for those that don't know.
[01:46:29.511 --> 01:46:35.633]  Ottawa ordered airline scanners months ago, says the Transportation Minister Barrett said.
[01:46:35.653 --> 01:46:38.975]  And he said, see, we were trying to protect you.
[01:46:39.035 --> 01:46:42.476]  Notice how this all coincided, Alan, with the underwear bomber.
[01:46:45.178 --> 01:46:45.938]  Anything else, Steve?
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.741]  Yeah, I just had a quick question.
[01:46:48.861 --> 01:46:58.346]  Oh, also, they said that if you didn't want to do it, you could opt out for the pat-down, which I think is a little bit of a... Yeah, so then they're going to phase that out.
[01:46:58.727 --> 01:47:00.548]  Gordon Brown even admitted what we already knew.
[01:47:01.028 --> 01:47:05.110]  First it's a few airports, then all airports, then well you can opt out, then you can't opt out.
[01:47:06.471 --> 01:47:09.192]  And then you get all these sheep by the millions in the database.
[01:47:09.893 --> 01:47:10.033]  Yeah.
[01:47:11.232 --> 01:47:17.115]  Everything starts almost semi-voluntarily, and then it becomes mandatory because everyone else was along with it.
[01:47:18.696 --> 01:47:21.857]  Everyone must biometrically scan to get their driver's license now.
[01:47:22.197 --> 01:47:22.857]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:47:22.938 --> 01:47:24.938]  John in Florida, go ahead, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:47:25.919 --> 01:47:28.180]  It's a pleasure speaking with you.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:28.860]  Can you hear me?
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.941]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:37.284]  I've been following the news vigorously for about two years now, and just, you know, some things want to get off my head real fast.
[01:47:37.324 --> 01:47:38.565]  I know you don't have much time, but
[01:47:40.127 --> 01:47:46.369]  I witnessed Bill O'Reilly here do what seems to be a complete 180 recently.
[01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:49.030]  Even Glenn Beck seems to be softening up.
[01:47:51.011 --> 01:47:55.613]  Yeah, they get the audience, like I warned you, and then they call for taxes.
[01:47:56.473 --> 01:47:59.754]  You're not a true conservative if you don't want to give the money to the banks.
[01:48:01.235 --> 01:48:03.716]  This is something that might enlighten people here.
[01:48:04.336 --> 01:48:07.297]  Honestly, I never heard of Alex Jones up until I
[01:48:09.307 --> 01:48:10.027]  I did something.
[01:48:10.187 --> 01:48:20.257]  I connected my computer and my flat screen television and I started getting into other media that was out there and that's where I discovered you.
[01:48:20.917 --> 01:48:30.526]  Since then I've been trying to spread the word and have people connect their computers to their flat screen TVs and
[01:48:31.462 --> 01:48:33.684]  You know, by going on YouTube and things like that.
[01:48:34.124 --> 01:48:37.507]  I gotta jump, you can call me back tomorrow if you want, but this is a big revolution.
[01:48:37.907 --> 01:48:46.113]  What's gonna kill Mainline TV, which is why they're moving to censor the web right now, is people plugging it into their television sets and stop tuning into Mainline TV.
[01:48:46.554 --> 01:48:54.540]  That's why they're putting stuff like myself and Jesse Ventura, the big show I was in last week, I'm in multiple shows, but it's re-airing tonight, 8 o'clock,
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:04.570]  Central, the new one premieres at 9 o'clock, but that World Extermination Death Plot episode airs tonight at 8 again on TruTV Central, 9 o'clock Eastern.
[01:49:04.911 --> 01:49:12.739]  But yes, they're moving to censor the web while also mainlining some of this info to kind of titrate the dose.
[01:49:12.859 --> 01:49:13.981]  Alan Watt comments on that.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.380]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:17.680]  That's all coming down.
[01:49:17.721 --> 01:49:32.943]  But the last part I'd like to say on this body scanner is they've also floated quite a few years ago, when they first floated the idea of body scanners, sedation, total sedation of every passenger from takeoff to landing by paramount means as well.
[01:49:33.443 --> 01:49:42.605]  And the next thing they're going to float after this, how to drug you through the entire flight, along with the bracelet where they can shock you if they notice you get out
[01:49:43.823 --> 01:49:48.608]  And notice they're already turning the lights off, even during daytime flights, already telling you to sit down.
[01:49:48.628 --> 01:49:50.309]  Of course, the stewardesses don't know.
[01:49:50.349 --> 01:49:51.110]  It's incremental.
[01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:53.072]  Now, keep your hands in your lap.
[01:49:53.112 --> 01:49:53.832]  You're a prisoner.
[01:49:54.113 --> 01:49:54.493]  That's right.
[01:49:54.733 --> 01:49:55.174]  That's right.
[01:49:56.935 --> 01:49:58.797]  I mean, this is dog training, is it not?
[01:49:58.817 --> 01:49:59.218]  It is.
[01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:06.001]  Alan, incredible job, incredible contribution to Fall of the Republic.
[01:50:06.021 --> 01:50:08.722]  You're also going to be in Fall of the Republic Part 2 we're working on.
[01:50:08.742 --> 01:50:11.343]  I just commend you for all you're doing.
[01:50:11.363 --> 01:50:13.364]  People should support you at CutIntoTheMatrix.com.
[01:50:13.424 --> 01:50:14.644]  Find more of your great work there.
[01:50:15.024 --> 01:50:16.545]  We'll talk to you again soon, my friend.
[01:50:16.845 --> 01:50:17.745]  It's been a pleasure, Alec.
[01:50:18.305 --> 01:50:19.246]  Take care, Alan Watt.
[01:50:19.786 --> 01:50:21.066]  Now, I really broke down.
[01:50:21.226 --> 01:50:23.167]  They're breaking up the family and all the details.
[01:50:23.187 --> 01:50:24.808]  I meant to give the phone number out.
[01:50:25.908 --> 01:50:28.449]  We'll do it tomorrow for this family in trouble in New York.
[01:50:28.549 --> 01:50:29.629]  Ron Paul's on tomorrow.
[01:50:29.849 --> 01:50:30.750]  Ron Paul tomorrow.
[01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:31.430]  Great job, crew.
[01:50:33.444 --> 01:50:34.654]  Thank you for listening to G...
