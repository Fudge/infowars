[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.753]  From the Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:09.395]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:17.941]  It is Sunday, my friends, the 21st day of November 2010.
[00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.844]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours, as we are every Sunday.
[00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:24.725]  And we're back weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:25.506]  to 2 p.m.
[00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.447]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:38.119]  This TSA story is a lot bigger than just the public saying no to having the government minimum wage minions stick their hands down your pants.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.066]  It's about the people getting angry and saying no to being domesticated and saying no to having their will broken.
[00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:55.294]  And now the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, hundreds of publications are pointing out this is a rebellion against tyranny.
[00:00:56.607 --> 00:01:13.374]  And a manifestation of the public's distrust of the government and the rejection of the hoax that is the false flag stage terror that has been used as the pretext to sell us on living in this authoritarian nightmare.
[00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:17.016]  The developments on this front are obviously off the charts.
[00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.557]  They're coming up first on the other side.
[00:01:19.637 --> 00:01:24.719]  Both the resistance is amazing, but also the brazen arrogance
[00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:32.754]  And hubris that we're seeing from the TSA, from the federal government, and all of their fear-mongering.
[00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:39.019]  And now the public is videotaping five-year-olds being strip-searched in public view.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.484]  Women having their fake breasts, who've had them amputated, removed in public.
[00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:47.967]  People that have colostomy bags or urine bags.
[00:01:49.148 --> 00:01:50.129]  They are being removed.
[00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.151]  It's spilling everywhere.
[00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.833]  The TSA is laughing with pleasure.
[00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:58.621]  I mean, this is the total dehumanization and it mirrors Nazi Germany.
[00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:03.398]  We have a report up at Infowars.com where Curt Nemo covers this.
[00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.521]  Later I'm going to show photos for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:08.962]  We're going to link to it in Curt's article.
[00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.463]  I have found more of the videos.
[00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:12.684]  I'm going to get added to his article.
[00:02:13.604 --> 00:02:23.831]  Warning, this shows, it's video of women with children, small toddlers, stripped down naked and being marched into pits to be shot in the back of the head.
[00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:28.615]  It's all part of the final humiliation, the final domination.
[00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:37.498]  Other animals don't recognize their nakedness, but humans do, because we're not animals, basically, is what Christians would say.
[00:02:37.518 --> 00:02:42.700]  And it's an act of total domination by the cult of power.
[00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:47.442]  It's an act of humiliation and mind control.
[00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:55.142]  And a lot of people like to put out the disinfo that Hitler didn't kill anybody and Hitler was a nice person.
[00:02:55.202 --> 00:02:56.363]  No, Hitler was a bad guy.
[00:02:57.104 --> 00:03:01.248]  They have this footage shot by the Nazis themselves of shooting women and babies.
[00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:08.475]  This has all been shown on PBS and everywhere else and we're going to show it here today.
[00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:13.750]  We're going to link in Kurt Nemo's article to more of this.
[00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:18.573]  I guess he was trying to spare the public and didn't link to some of the more hardcore stuff, but we are.
[00:03:19.193 --> 00:03:27.357]  But the issue of the government putting its hands on you, then down your pants, then stripping you down, it's an act of total domination.
[00:03:27.377 --> 00:03:30.459]  We're going to be discussing it and we're not going to be putting up with it here.
[00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.621]  They're also reporting that there are
[00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:40.474]  Huge lines in Chicago and other areas because of people opting out.
[00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:45.457]  A lot of people, even Drudge Report points out, you know, is this the TSA?
[00:03:46.037 --> 00:03:53.021]  Also dragging their feet, taking their time to try to demonize those that are protesting against them.
[00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.003]  Remember, it's the airports today, but it's the streets
[00:03:56.563 --> 00:04:01.364]  It's the shopping malls, it's the public events tomorrow, and they've already been phasing that in.
[00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:03.625]  So that is coming up.
[00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:13.868]  When we come back from break, though, I first want to go over some of the news we'll be getting into in the second hour today, and then we'll dive into the whole TSA situation.
[00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:24.331]  On the other side of this quick break, the websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, and JonesReport.com.
[00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:35.177]  But a lot of publications are now rightly pointing out that it's been this radio show that first pushed this out really over the edge with the help of the Drudge Report.
[00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:41.642]  And so I salute the Drudge Report again for continuing to track what's happening.
[00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:51.608]  A lot of the big corporate media is now apologizing for the TSA, telling us, look, minimum wage, people that couldn't get jobs at McDonald's, grab into your genitals.
[00:04:51.648 --> 00:04:53.850]  This is what Land of the Free, Home of the Brave is all about.
[00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.091]  Nobody's buying it.
[00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:55.491]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:03.136]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:09.139]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.284]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:18.225 --> 00:05:20.706]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:22.307 --> 00:05:24.249]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.584]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:34.467]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:05:35.148 --> 00:05:35.969]  Others don't.
[00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.270]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:40.032]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:40.312 --> 00:05:42.874]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:49.459]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.042]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:54.564]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:05:54.904 --> 00:05:55.765]  Others don't.
[00:05:58.052 --> 00:06:03.096]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:05.798]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:12.243 --> 00:06:18.749]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday transmission against tyranny in the defense of our constitutional republic.
[00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:20.951]  We don't have liberty, we have nothing.
[00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:27.035]  Americans should only be scared of losing their freedoms and their liberties, not scared of the cave dwelling
[00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:33.142]  Central Asian boogeyman that the government is using as a pretext to enslave the American people.
[00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:46.717]  The good news on the number one story worldwide right now, the naked body scanners, the fondling going on at the airports, is that more and more congressmen and others that I've seen on the news are pointing out
[00:06:47.498 --> 00:06:56.384]  That Homeland Security is targeted at the American people, not at the open borders, not at the illegal aliens that can rent aircraft, as ABC News has reported.
[00:06:56.944 --> 00:06:58.945]  They are using the threat of terrorism.
[00:06:58.965 --> 00:07:04.609]  You've got a better chance of drowning or dying of a honeybee sting or a wasp sting every year.
[00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:06.090]  More people die of that than terrorism.
[00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.252]  But they just hype it like, we've got to protect you.
[00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:10.853]  It's so scary.
[00:07:11.293 --> 00:07:16.136]  Somebody, you know, might try to hurt someone, so we've got to enslave you.
[00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:21.275]  And this is the excuse for the federal government to totally take over society.
[00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:24.762]  Big developments on that front coming up in just a moment.
[00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.250]  But first, some of the other news coming up in the second hour today.
[00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.051]  Senate Bill 510, vote delayed until after Thanksgiving.
[00:07:33.492 --> 00:07:35.672]  Take action now to oppose food tyranny.
[00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:38.133]  I have read the subsections of the bill.
[00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:41.854]  It's written by big agribusiness to shut down local farms and ranches.
[00:07:42.235 --> 00:07:43.735]  It makes you go under federal control.
[00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:50.537]  You can't even can, you know, grapes or olives or pickles without a government license.
[00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:51.518]  You can't slice up
[00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.225]  Uh, something out of the garden and give it to your neighbors under this.
[00:07:56.806 --> 00:07:59.511]  And it also has in it a provision.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:08.424]  Where if you buy anything more than $600, you've got to fill out a 1099 form, so it also tracks everything you're doing.
[00:08:09.124 --> 00:08:22.310]  Also, and I can confirm Wire Magazine is accurate here, they've got a web censorship bill, sales to the Senate committee, set to pass in the next few weeks in the lame duck session, allows the Obama administration to shut down any websites
[00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.573]  They wish, without a judge, a jury, they just have total dictatorial power.
[00:08:27.014 --> 00:08:32.758]  And Senator Jay Rockefeller, who heads up the Key Committee, did say last week, quote, he wants to shut down
[00:08:33.908 --> 00:08:37.712]  And quote, take off the air Fox News and MSNBC.
[00:08:38.293 --> 00:08:41.977]  So they want to go after some of the biggest targets first and have total government control.
[00:08:42.017 --> 00:08:44.660]  He went on to say the government will decide what you see.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.543]  The criminals in government know you're aware of them.
[00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:49.305]  They are bringing in tyranny.
[00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:50.766]  It's happened everywhere else.
[00:08:50.866 --> 00:08:51.647]  It's happening here.
[00:08:51.687 --> 00:08:54.791]  People better grow up and realize how dire our straits are.
[00:08:56.713 --> 00:08:59.174]  Quote, face the dangers or be slaves.
[00:08:59.534 --> 00:09:01.215]  And the dangers are hyped and made up.
[00:09:01.555 --> 00:09:03.096]  The real danger is the government.
[00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:06.118]  Also, we've passed the one-year anniversary of Climategate.
[00:09:06.498 --> 00:09:09.780]  All those internal UN documents, how they engage in fraud.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.280]  They know the earth isn't getting warmer.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.301]  They know it's not a threat.
[00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:13.682]  They just want to tax you.
[00:09:14.702 --> 00:09:24.132]  One year anniversary of their Copenhagen world government program going down in flames, but they're meeting next week again down in Cancun to try to ram it back through.
[00:09:24.593 --> 00:09:29.037]  Also, scientists says North Korea has stunning nuke facility, AP reports.
[00:09:29.498 --> 00:09:32.301]  But again, who gave North Korea in the mid-90s
[00:09:33.642 --> 00:09:36.003]  Uh, the nuclear reactors that can build A-bombs.
[00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:37.143]  Bill Clinton.
[00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:39.004]  But it's bipartisan treason.
[00:09:39.524 --> 00:09:44.426]  The head of the Swiss company at the time, ABB, was none other than Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:48.307]  So they give the enemies the weapon systems.
[00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:49.307]  Who's built up China?
[00:09:49.327 --> 00:09:50.588]  Who's given them the Panama Canal?
[00:09:50.968 --> 00:09:53.328]  Who's set up deals to give them most of our industry?
[00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:54.749]  Our own criminal government.
[00:09:56.042 --> 00:09:59.665]  And it's the same story yet again with Anwar al-Awlaki.
[00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:01.547]  We're going to be talking more about later.
[00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:07.231]  The government admits that he is behind the Christmas Day attack.
[00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:09.493]  They admit he's behind the underwear bombing.
[00:10:09.633 --> 00:10:11.395]  They admit he's behind the Fort Hood shooting.
[00:10:12.536 --> 00:10:13.556]  The Times Square attack.
[00:10:13.857 --> 00:10:17.820]  They also admit he works for the Pentagon and the CIA and is being protected.
[00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:21.006]  Yeah, they're making trillions a year.
[00:10:21.046 --> 00:10:23.348]  You think these big corporations are going to stage some terror?
[00:10:24.028 --> 00:10:26.610]  And going to have some patsy Muslim extremists under their control?
[00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:36.237]  And I go on big conservative talk shows and they don't deny that Anwar al-Awlaki, now the number one in Al-Qaeda, works for our government.
[00:10:36.277 --> 00:10:40.800]  They just move on and say, shouldn't we give up all our rights or the Muslims will get us?
[00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:42.742]  Don't you get it?
[00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.103]  It's staged!
[00:10:46.397 --> 00:10:54.308]  They made the military people that videotaped multiple shooters last year at Fort Hood in the shooting erase their cell phone cams.
[00:10:55.169 --> 00:11:02.419]  The Pentagon and the CIA are blocking Hassan being given the surveillance footage in the trial.
[00:11:03.328 --> 00:11:04.329]  Why are they doing that?
[00:11:04.409 --> 00:11:06.151]  Because it was a staged event.
[00:11:06.812 --> 00:11:13.018]  I was told that by members of Army Intelligence and others that are our sources on Hood at the time.
[00:11:13.098 --> 00:11:14.599]  I live right here in Central Texas.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.582]  They're listening to us at Fort Hood right now on 590 AM and on 1330.
[00:11:21.613 --> 00:11:23.334]  We're on two stations they can listen to.
[00:11:23.714 --> 00:11:26.855]  They can listen to us on KILF at Fort Hood.
[00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:28.196]  Out of Dallas.
[00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:29.116]  And they do.
[00:11:29.777 --> 00:11:33.799]  And if you're a new listener and you heard me just talk about that, don't say this guy's a liar.
[00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.561]  In your mind, bet me a million bucks, hypothetically.
[00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:44.621]  And then go search the term, Anwar al-Awlaki met at the Pentagon after 9-11.
[00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:47.322]  He's on the news as the number three in Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:47.662 --> 00:11:49.843]  Today, he's number one on the killer capture list.
[00:11:50.383 --> 00:11:51.303]  He was number three at the time.
[00:11:51.843 --> 00:11:53.964]  Meanwhile, he's hanging out secretly at the Pentagon.
[00:11:54.624 --> 00:11:56.605]  He runs all of these guys.
[00:11:58.268 --> 00:11:59.209]  They protected him.
[00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:01.990]  They're using it to take your rights.
[00:12:02.551 --> 00:12:07.694]  Homeland Security was set up for the American people.
[00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:13.778]  The Patriot Act, Section 802, says that it's for the American people and for any misdemeanor.
[00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:18.581]  It's being used to abolish our Bill of Rights and our Constitution.
[00:12:19.182 --> 00:12:25.006]  We have criminal, offshore, swindling banks that have seized control of the federal government.
[00:12:25.606 --> 00:12:28.147]  They need an excuse to set up a police state in the U.S.
[00:12:28.507 --> 00:12:42.371]  so they can get away with taking your pension funds, getting rid of your cost of living expense on your social security, raising your taxes, engaging in all sorts of insider trading, not telling Congress where the trillions of dollars have gone.
[00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:51.574]  They need a police state in place so they tell you it's for foreign men with big scary beards and turbans on their heads.
[00:12:56.428 --> 00:13:02.993]  But really, the whole thing is pointed at you and I. And the American people are beginning to get this and understand this.
[00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:10.940]  Here's some of the latest TSA headlines, and we're coming back and getting to the really big bombshell developments that play in the video and the audio of this.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.144]  MSNBC, TSA pat down leaves traveler covered in urine.
[00:13:16.644 --> 00:13:19.787]  I was absolutely humiliated, said bladder cancer victim.
[00:13:20.657 --> 00:13:21.478]  There's another report.
[00:13:21.518 --> 00:13:23.580]  They're ripping colostomy bags out of people.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.185]  And their excrement is spraying out and the TSA thinks it's funny and makes them clean it up in front of everyone.
[00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:33.907]  They're making people who can't walk be picked up by other passengers out of their chairs.
[00:13:34.807 --> 00:13:36.608]  They are there to humiliate you.
[00:13:36.668 --> 00:13:38.188]  They are there to dominate you.
[00:13:38.628 --> 00:13:40.349]  They are there to train you to be a slave.
[00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:54.373]  This guy had the type of surgery where you have a bag on the outside of your body, a urstotomy bag, and he told them, they made him take his shirt off, and then they said, what is that?
[00:13:54.393 --> 00:13:57.314]  Again, there's over 200,000 Americans that have these.
[00:13:58.735 --> 00:14:01.177]  And they just, the guy said, please don't do that.
[00:14:01.197 --> 00:14:02.158]  They just ripped it out of him.
[00:14:02.178 --> 00:14:03.579]  Just, you know, this is what we do.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.341]  So that's MSNBC.
[00:14:07.522 --> 00:14:17.730]  Women are forced, there's a bunch of reports of this, to in front of everyone remove their fake breasts when they've had their breasts removed from mastectomies.
[00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.031]  All part of humiliation.
[00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:20.252]  Nothing to do with Al Qaeda.
[00:14:20.272 --> 00:14:22.174]  Remember the borders are still wide open.
[00:14:22.814 --> 00:14:26.978]  And now there's this latest video shot just two days ago.
[00:14:28.137 --> 00:14:30.199]  Now, remember the denial of the American people.
[00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:34.363]  Just three weeks ago, my employee, Michelle, flew back from Denver.
[00:14:34.563 --> 00:14:37.265]  Her 20-month-old baby was fondled in the genital area.
[00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:42.270]  Her eight-year-old daughter, a man, searched Michelle, grabbed her breast, grabbed her genitals.
[00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:48.996]  Drudge Report linked to the video of that testimony, and people said it wasn't true, even when the TSA admits they do this.
[00:14:49.016 --> 00:14:53.440]  Well, now, because we forced this out into the mainstream along with the Drudge Report working together,
[00:14:55.165 --> 00:15:00.968]  Now because we've rammed this out to be the biggest story in America and worldwide right now, no one denies that.
[00:15:01.608 --> 00:15:04.509]  Now that this is being debated, the TSA goes, yeah we do.
[00:15:04.569 --> 00:15:07.030]  In fact, you don't like us doing it on the outside?
[00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:17.055]  Now it's confirmed, Associated Press, Wall Street Journal, two weeks after we told you, they now stick their hands in your pants and grab your genitals if they see fit.
[00:15:17.895 --> 00:15:20.936]  This is a religious sacrament of tyranny.
[00:15:22.217 --> 00:15:24.278]  What they do in Nazi Germany, their favorite thing,
[00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:32.520]  Was to strip you down before they herded you into a pit to be shot.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:42.784]  And I got photos for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're linking these up at InfoWars.com, of women with their little babies and the video shot by the Nazis of their heads being blown off.
[00:15:43.703 --> 00:15:44.643]  Why do they strip them down?
[00:15:44.663 --> 00:15:47.405]  Because they like to humiliate them before they kill them.
[00:15:47.665 --> 00:15:49.325]  Tyrants like to strip you in public.
[00:15:49.606 --> 00:15:51.326]  It's the ultimate form of humiliation.
[00:15:51.686 --> 00:15:55.808]  We're going to come back and show the young boy in full public being strip searched.
[00:15:55.868 --> 00:15:57.149]  It's the top link on Drudge Report.
[00:15:58.151 --> 00:16:02.394]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:03.315]  Number one.
[00:16:03.615 --> 00:16:06.778]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:16:07.038 --> 00:16:07.618]  Number two.
[00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:12.462]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:16:12.802 --> 00:16:13.243]  It's true.
[00:16:13.543 --> 00:16:18.106]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:16:18.407 --> 00:16:18.967]  Number three.
[00:16:19.247 --> 00:16:22.530]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.513]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:16:26.713 --> 00:16:27.273]  Number 4.
[00:16:27.514 --> 00:16:29.875]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:16:30.276 --> 00:16:33.658]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:34.498]  Number 5.
[00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:38.661]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:16:38.902 --> 00:16:43.665]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:16:43.945 --> 00:16:47.969]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:49.691]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:51.993]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:16:52.153 --> 00:16:54.496]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:16:58.902 --> 00:17:13.376]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:17:14.377 --> 00:17:18.061]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:17:19.065 --> 00:17:31.054]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:17:31.815 --> 00:17:39.081]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:49.370]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.413]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:57.197]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:01.810]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:08.095]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:15.561]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:20.425]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.867]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:29.191]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:18:29.411 --> 00:18:31.672]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:18:31.712 --> 00:18:32.033]  Call us!
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.360]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[00:18:51.727 --> 00:18:52.187]  Thank you.
[00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:02.682]  Tyranny is here.
[00:19:03.022 --> 00:19:06.584]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:19:06.644 --> 00:19:09.166]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:14.649]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:21.293]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:19:21.713 --> 00:19:27.257]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:19:27.677 --> 00:19:31.379]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.882]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:19:36.162 --> 00:19:41.666]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:19:42.106 --> 00:19:45.068]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:19:45.668 --> 00:19:47.089]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:48.070]  It's here.
[00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:55.772]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:00.254]  Coast to Coast.
[00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:02.014]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:02.675 --> 00:20:05.876]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.054 --> 00:20:22.419]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.961]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:20:30.164 --> 00:20:32.865]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:36.748 --> 00:20:38.809]  Look at the huge effect we're having right now.
[00:20:38.829 --> 00:20:43.392]  Driving this TSA story in the last three and a half weeks to number one.
[00:20:45.128 --> 00:21:01.491]  More than 15 of our articles posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, reposted to Drudge Report, literally igniting the awakening as the people come out of their trance and realize the dehumanizing degradation they're under.
[00:21:03.112 --> 00:21:09.513]  Now what's being done here is the system knows that if they can destroy Americans and Europeans' dignity,
[00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:22.466]  And train us to go into radiation bathing machines, train them to let untrained minimum-wage goons stick their hands in our pants now, and strip-search old people in wheelchairs and small children.
[00:21:22.766 --> 00:21:25.628]  They can export it to the streets, and that's already happening.
[00:21:25.668 --> 00:21:28.911]  The TSA has hundreds of giant mobile 18-wheelers.
[00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:30.492]  They're already being deployed.
[00:21:32.033 --> 00:21:35.035]  Total federal power grab, but the borders are wide open.
[00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:36.616]  This is for us.
[00:21:37.577 --> 00:21:39.418]  This is our journey to tyranny.
[00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:44.175]  Now, if you're a PrisonPlanet.TV viewer, we'll archive this as well.
[00:21:44.535 --> 00:22:04.163]  If you just type Jewish women stripped naked, you will see National Archives websites and other areas, this stuff's been on PBS, of women by the hundreds with babies in their arms, and if you blow that up you can see the toddlers in their arms, being marched in at Nazi death camps to be shot along with their babies.
[00:22:04.963 --> 00:22:09.244]  Now, this all started with just asking for the papers, please, in the 1930s.
[00:22:11.092 --> 00:22:13.613]  And oh, you've got to go through the security checkpoints in the cities.
[00:22:14.574 --> 00:22:15.674]  And it ended with this.
[00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.015]  And we also have video.
[00:22:18.316 --> 00:22:20.297]  In fact, I found the video online.
[00:22:20.317 --> 00:22:24.219]  If you ask Phil, there's YouTubes of the women being shot as well.
[00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:25.579]  And the men.
[00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:32.403]  And I just want to point out, as we go towards this and down this direction,
[00:22:33.703 --> 00:22:36.365]  I'm not going to go and get stripped down and then run down into a pit.
[00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:39.967]  And if I was stripped down running into a pit, I'm going to fight.
[00:22:40.427 --> 00:22:41.948]  I'm not going to just run off into a pit.
[00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:48.172]  And by the way, in my film Police State 2000, I have footage.
[00:22:52.415 --> 00:22:53.535]  Let's show them real footage.
[00:22:53.856 --> 00:22:55.016]  I mean, we have plenty of that.
[00:22:55.877 --> 00:22:56.697]  They've got it right over there.
[00:23:01.408 --> 00:23:08.429]  I'm not going to be marched into a pit and be shot in the back of the head.
[00:23:08.569 --> 00:23:17.151]  And in my film, Police Day 2000, I'm at an urban warfare drill in California with the Marines, and they, in front of the news, say, now you're going to watch an execution.
[00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:19.911]  And they put a role player, playing the part of a U.S.
[00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:23.032]  citizen, on his knees, and they practice shooting him in the back of the head.
[00:23:23.732 --> 00:23:27.852]  So, our military has been turned into an engine of these offshore banks that run our country.
[00:23:28.813 --> 00:23:30.573]  Now, let's go ahead and go to this first video.
[00:23:32.173 --> 00:23:35.516]  Again, this story's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:23:35.877 --> 00:23:38.519]  Young boys strip search by TSA in public.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.863]  And they pull down blouses, they pull out bras.
[00:23:42.503 --> 00:23:44.766]  Now there's lawsuits over it right here in Texas.
[00:23:45.246 --> 00:23:48.469]  And then they make fun of the women's breasts, then they come up and ask for dates.
[00:23:50.591 --> 00:23:54.855]  They start beating their chest, CBS reports, and say, I have power, I have power.
[00:23:55.255 --> 00:23:57.877]  Or they plant drugs on women and demand sex.
[00:23:58.638 --> 00:24:05.884]  I mean, this is the type of $10 an hour lunatics the feds have hired, and they've gone out and profiled who they want.
[00:24:06.284 --> 00:24:07.044]  Who will do this?
[00:24:08.174 --> 00:24:12.438]  You know, a sworn police officer can't do this, but federal goons they can.
[00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:24.770]  Now this happened two days ago and listen to the crowd getting angry watching a five-year-old boy having his shirt pulled off and then the TSA rubbing over his skin and rubbing their hands through his hair.
[00:24:26.129 --> 00:24:27.790]  Again, a total act of submission.
[00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.150]  I'm putting my hands on your body.
[00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.091]  The little boy has a crew cut.
[00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:33.811]  They run their hands through his hair.
[00:24:34.171 --> 00:24:35.572]  This is prisoner training.
[00:24:35.812 --> 00:24:38.273]  You notice they call torture enhanced interrogation?
[00:24:38.493 --> 00:24:39.953]  This is called enhanced pat-down.
[00:24:40.533 --> 00:24:41.453]  You are prisoners.
[00:24:41.794 --> 00:24:42.734]  You are terrorists.
[00:24:42.994 --> 00:24:44.694]  This is your baptism of slavery.
[00:24:45.015 --> 00:24:46.415]  Here is the video and audio.
[00:24:52.644 --> 00:24:55.386]  So they got the little boy's shirt off.
[00:24:55.406 --> 00:24:57.667]  There it is, searching his little body.
[00:24:57.727 --> 00:24:58.868]  Grabbing his crotch.
[00:24:58.888 --> 00:25:00.069]  Are they harassing a kid?
[00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:02.331]  Yep.
[00:25:02.351 --> 00:25:02.591]  Nice.
[00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:03.352]  Ridiculous.
[00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:04.352]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:23.432]  Now let's leave the child away.
[00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:28.335]  No, they are not doing something ridiculous.
[00:25:28.695 --> 00:25:31.997]  Oh, the ADIQ goons don't know why they're doing it.
[00:25:32.318 --> 00:25:35.800]  They believe they're doing it because the citizens may all have underwear bombs on them.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.644]  Because, you know, the guy that hangs out at the Pentagon, Anwar al-Awlaki, ran the underwear bomber.
[00:25:42.304 --> 00:25:43.305]  That's a Pentagon op.
[00:25:43.825 --> 00:25:46.507]  It's on record the State Department was ordered to help him get on the plane.
[00:25:47.227 --> 00:25:51.189]  But then we have all the photos, all the videos of the Nazis.
[00:25:51.549 --> 00:26:00.515]  The first thing they do before they killed you was strip you down as part of an act of humiliation and dehumanization before they blow your head off.
[00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:05.678]  Land of the free, home of the brave, doing what the Nazis did.
[00:26:07.637 --> 00:26:17.281]  And gullible people in denial just three weeks ago were accusing us of lying about the TSA now touching people's genitals through their clothes.
[00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:23.323]  Well, now, in the last two weeks, they have announced, we've got super enhanced.
[00:26:24.144 --> 00:26:30.446]  We're now sticking our hands, this is AP, you name it, inside and grabbing your genitals.
[00:26:30.926 --> 00:26:32.367]  They actually grab them.
[00:26:33.445 --> 00:26:36.526]  And on countless newscasts, it's now the biggest story, I know you've seen it.
[00:26:36.826 --> 00:26:39.427]  We've posted it all on InfowarsandPrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:40.748 --> 00:26:43.009]  They go between your legs and lift you up.
[00:26:44.189 --> 00:26:46.390]  People describe it as almost being lifted off the floor.
[00:26:48.051 --> 00:26:51.472]  They press to make sure that your genitals aren't bombs.
[00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:52.852]  Uh, what's this bag?
[00:26:53.093 --> 00:26:54.233]  Sir, I have a medical card.
[00:26:54.653 --> 00:26:55.754]  That's my artificial bladder.
[00:26:55.794 --> 00:26:57.094]  Please don't, please don't pull on it.
[00:26:57.134 --> 00:26:57.994]  This is MSNBC.
[00:26:58.214 --> 00:26:59.835]  Please, no, don't, no!
[00:26:59.955 --> 00:27:01.856]  They just, ah, ripping it out of your body.
[00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:05.545]  This is how they roll.
[00:27:06.146 --> 00:27:08.546]  You know, your doctor has to ask permission to touch you.
[00:27:11.247 --> 00:27:12.207]  I've had medical exams.
[00:27:12.227 --> 00:27:13.308]  They say, now I'm going to touch you.
[00:27:13.788 --> 00:27:23.771]  Your doctor, a trained person, you know, six, eight years in college, but now minimum wage people are ripping colostomy bags and urine bags out of the sides of people.
[00:27:24.031 --> 00:27:25.971]  That's land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:29.212]  Now five-year-old boys are having their shirts pulled off in public.
[00:27:29.452 --> 00:27:31.113]  Women are having their bras pulled down.
[00:27:32.895 --> 00:27:34.856]  And they tell you it's to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:27:36.056 --> 00:27:54.223]  Well, those of you that love your official story of 9-11 and want to cling to it, okay, let's say there's real men in caves that made NORAD stand down, and let's ignore the fact that the number one in Al-Qaeda is working for the CIA on record, and let's ignore the fact that our government's declassified, that they staged the Gulf of Tonkin and other events to start wars, and that they admit they staged terror.
[00:27:55.023 --> 00:27:56.345]  Let's just ignore all those facts.
[00:27:57.006 --> 00:28:09.481]  You have a better chance, according to major actuaries that have been done, and news reports that have been written up about it, of dying from a honeybee sting, or drowning in your bathtub, or in your pool.
[00:28:10.062 --> 00:28:11.223]  Many times better chance!
[00:28:11.704 --> 00:28:13.446]  Or being struck by a bolt of lightning!
[00:28:14.261 --> 00:28:22.068]  But the media creates this almost psychological compulsion to just be shaking in fear and watching your neighbors.
[00:28:22.088 --> 00:28:28.053]  And they've got signs up all over the airport, help us watch everyone, announcements about terrorists everywhere.
[00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.772]  Meanwhile, they never built the border fence.
[00:28:32.153 --> 00:28:32.973]  It's wide open.
[00:28:33.734 --> 00:28:37.657]  They report that in San Diego, hundreds of boats a night land.
[00:28:37.977 --> 00:28:42.581]  There's no police there to stop illegals pouring in from China, Mexico, you name it.
[00:28:43.101 --> 00:28:44.943]  It's all wide open, the Middle East.
[00:28:45.503 --> 00:28:46.584]  It's all a joke.
[00:28:47.245 --> 00:28:48.486]  This is here to train you.
[00:28:48.506 --> 00:28:56.332]  Now when we get back, we're going to cover how the revolt is in full swing, the opt-out day, the other abuse, and what's really going on.
[00:28:56.372 --> 00:28:56.833]  Stay with us.
[00:28:58.339 --> 00:29:04.809]  Hello, Alex Jones has told you about the delicious, safe, easy to fix, and very storable food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:29:04.969 --> 00:29:08.515]  He's also told you that eFoodsDirect has the best food on the planet.

[00:29:10.338 --> 00:29:13.483]  It's that time of year, and their holiday special is here.
[00:29:13.643 --> 00:29:14.103]  I think so.
[00:29:36.633 --> 00:29:38.554]  Free shipping on the entire order.
[00:29:38.774 --> 00:29:44.097]  These holiday packs are always special combinations of food that are not available at any other time of the year.
[00:29:44.298 --> 00:29:44.518]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:29:44.538 --> 00:29:46.959]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:29:46.999 --> 00:29:47.319]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:50.301]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:03.019]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:03.399 --> 00:30:06.422]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:06.642 --> 00:30:11.426]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:11.446 --> 00:30:17.692]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:17.832 --> 00:30:20.075]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:20.615 --> 00:30:20.895]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:20.915 --> 00:30:21.336]  Bernanke?
[00:30:21.436 --> 00:30:21.996]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:22.016 --> 00:30:22.857]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:23.197 --> 00:30:25.618]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:39.508 --> 00:30:46.452]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:46.793 --> 00:30:55.898]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:28.234]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:31:50.097 --> 00:31:50.617]  Thank you!
[00:31:57.571 --> 00:32:01.794]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:02.114 --> 00:32:02.715]  Number 1.
[00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:06.177]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:07.018]  Number 2.
[00:32:07.318 --> 00:32:11.882]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:12.202 --> 00:32:12.642]  It's true.
[00:32:12.942 --> 00:32:17.506]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:17.826 --> 00:32:18.366]  Number 3.
[00:32:18.647 --> 00:32:21.929]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:22.229 --> 00:32:25.932]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:26.132 --> 00:32:26.693]  Number 4.
[00:32:26.933 --> 00:32:29.295]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:29.695 --> 00:32:33.079]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:33.899]  Number 5.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.083]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:38.303 --> 00:32:43.068]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:43.348 --> 00:32:47.390]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.090]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.411]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:51.571 --> 00:32:54.152]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:54.172 --> 00:33:00.275]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:00.655 --> 00:33:02.055]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:02.696 --> 00:33:05.897]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:09.008 --> 00:33:10.489]  I think this song says it all.
[00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.251]  Our little message of the TSA.
[00:33:18.075 --> 00:33:21.358]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[00:33:21.398 --> 00:33:22.879]  I don't want a TSA!
[00:33:22.899 --> 00:33:26.742]  Something you call love, but confess.
[00:33:26.802 --> 00:33:28.123]  You've been messing in our pants.
[00:33:29.164 --> 00:33:30.165]  You've been a messer.
[00:33:30.705 --> 00:33:32.647]  Well, you shouldn't have been a messer.
[00:33:32.667 --> 00:33:34.348]  Sticking your hands in surgery points.
[00:33:34.448 --> 00:33:37.831]  And now someone else is getting all your best.
[00:33:50.135 --> 00:33:52.596]  That's right, we know your bosses staged the terror attacks.
[00:33:55.097 --> 00:33:56.258]  We're taking our country back.
[00:34:03.262 --> 00:34:05.783]  You say there's no radiation?
[00:34:05.823 --> 00:34:06.844]  You say you don't save the images?
[00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:10.759]  That's right.
[00:34:12.521 --> 00:34:13.742]  Bunch of liars.
[00:34:34.288 --> 00:34:34.808]  And guess what?
[00:34:34.828 --> 00:34:36.589]  I got a brand new pack of matches.
[00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:38.810]  I struck it three and a half weeks ago with my listeners.
[00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:41.191]  We're now driving the media agenda.
[00:34:44.012 --> 00:34:44.632]  Back to Nancy.
[00:34:48.093 --> 00:34:48.814]  In our pants.
[00:34:50.328 --> 00:34:53.649]  And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned.
[00:34:53.709 --> 00:34:55.690]  You're not allowed to rip colostomy bags off.
[00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:59.271]  I just found me a brand new box of matches.
[00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:00.731]  It's called the Sleeping Giant!
[00:35:00.811 --> 00:35:01.192]  Ha ha!
[00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:04.553]  But he knows you ain't had time to learn.
[00:35:04.653 --> 00:35:07.173]  But the Sleeping Giant knows you ain't had time to learn.
[00:35:07.193 --> 00:35:09.034]  Boots are made for walking.
[00:35:09.994 --> 00:35:11.755]  And that's just what they'll do.
[00:35:12.995 --> 00:35:17.317]  One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.
[00:35:19.585 --> 00:35:20.366]  Oh, here we go!
[00:35:20.406 --> 00:35:21.887]  Start walking, America!
[00:35:22.228 --> 00:35:24.069]  You leave our borders wide open!
[00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.731]  You don't profile anybody!
[00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:27.653]  Because you know we're the enemy!
[00:35:28.273 --> 00:35:30.215]  We're the people you wanna suck off of!
[00:35:30.776 --> 00:35:32.698]  We're the people you parasites wanna break!
[00:35:33.318 --> 00:35:35.380]  Like we're a prostitute and you're our pimp!
[00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:37.142]  We see right through ya!
[00:35:38.423 --> 00:35:41.646]  Well done there, Nancy Sinatra, helping us out.
[00:35:43.127 --> 00:35:44.469]  Dealing with the TSA.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.161]  Now, the arrogant TSA.
[00:35:48.521 --> 00:36:01.764]  CNN reports since 2006 they've lost nine billion dollars a year from foreigners alone in tourism who mark the different surveys saying they don't come here because of what the TSA does.
[00:36:02.184 --> 00:36:11.127]  They've been doing these rape downs and these body scans to most of the foreigners coming in from Western Europe and other areas in the last six years.
[00:36:13.163 --> 00:36:14.744]  Now they're doing it to the general public.
[00:36:14.784 --> 00:36:15.804]  And I got news for you.
[00:36:16.064 --> 00:36:19.526]  They've announced that they're going to do pat-downs on top of the scanners.
[00:36:19.686 --> 00:36:35.113]  And they told the Chicago Tribune, the TSA did, which stands for Total Sexual Assault, the Federal Bureau of Total Sexual Assault, or TSA, and that's what this is, Total Sexual Assault and Federal Slave Training for us, their cattle.
[00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:45.489]  They have told the Chicago Tribune that yes, everyone will be body scanned by next year when they have machines in everywhere.
[00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:53.215]  Meanwhile, general aviation is wide open, illegals, ABC News reports can rent planes, the illegal aliens can pour in.
[00:36:53.676 --> 00:36:54.597]  It's a joke!
[00:36:55.557 --> 00:36:56.438]  It's a joke!
[00:36:58.039 --> 00:36:59.881]  This has all been done by design.
[00:37:00.582 --> 00:37:05.086]  Now continuing, TSA tells Wall Street Journal security pat-downs are here to stay.
[00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:08.280]  And they went on to say that if you don't like it, don't fly.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:19.627]  Well, Governor Jesse Ventura, even though they're offering him a third season of his hit TV show, Conspiracy Theory, that I consult on, he exclusively told us Friday, and it was top story on Drudge for two days, that he's not going to fly.
[00:37:20.128 --> 00:37:23.070]  Hillary Clinton has come out and said she's not going to fly.
[00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:27.313]  We're going to play a clip from that interview with the governor in a few minutes, but first, I want to play a clip.
[00:37:28.357 --> 00:37:37.680]  of TSA stripping an elderly man down, they get him out of his wheelchair, they pull his pants down, and they say, why are you doing this?
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.500]  And they start saying, I have power, I have power.
[00:37:40.701 --> 00:37:48.903]  Then we have another clip of another TSA group in San Diego saying that they are God and going crazy.
[00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:59.956]  Look, you take somebody who couldn't get a job at McDonald's, and you make them do humiliating things that a normal person... I've seen all these police groups coming out against this, saying, look, this is crazy.
[00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:07.721]  I've had multiple DAs that we've talked to, one on air last week from San Mateo County, where the San Francisco airport's at.
[00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:11.544]  He's got people staking the airport out, and is going to arrest them.
[00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:13.450]  By the TSA workers.
[00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:21.397]  Who died and made the Feds God because they say somebody might get hurt by a terrorist and meanwhile in every case they're protecting the terrorist?
[00:38:21.737 --> 00:38:24.560]  Whether it's Hassan or the underwear bomber.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.322]  Oh, these are real Muslim lunatic extremists.
[00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:29.004]  But they're being protected!
[00:38:29.384 --> 00:38:33.988]  They're being handled by US government agents that pose as Muslim mastermind leaders.
[00:38:34.268 --> 00:38:35.109]  That's on record!
[00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:36.070]  Don't you get it?
[00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.111]  You're the target!
[00:38:37.611 --> 00:38:38.332]  Alright, I'm ranting.
[00:38:38.352 --> 00:38:39.954]  I want to get into the other news than your phone calls.
[00:38:40.214 --> 00:38:44.479]  Let's go ahead and get to this clip of I Have Power, I Have Power.
[00:38:44.799 --> 00:38:50.625]  These are the army of minimum wage goons that are now on the streets of America.
[00:38:50.725 --> 00:38:51.847]  Oh yes, here it is.
[00:38:53.362 --> 00:38:54.063]  Humiliation.
[00:38:54.083 --> 00:39:02.850]  71-year-old Robert Perry was also taken to a room like this by a TSA agent when his artificial knee set off the metal detector.
[00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:05.713]  He yelled at me, no, get the belt off.
[00:39:05.793 --> 00:39:07.114]  I told you to get the belt off.
[00:39:07.875 --> 00:39:08.955]  So I took the belt off.
[00:39:09.256 --> 00:39:11.438]  He ran his hands down over and pulled the pants down.
[00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:12.959]  They went down around my ankles.
[00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:17.343]  At that point, Perry was standing in his underwear in public view.
[00:39:17.683 --> 00:39:19.164]  He asked to see a supervisor.
[00:39:19.424 --> 00:39:20.565]  That made things worse.
[00:39:21.466 --> 00:39:23.608]  She was yelling, I have power!
[00:39:23.969 --> 00:39:24.729]  I have power!
[00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.910]  I have power!
[00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:32.537]  The power to stop him from flying to Florida with his wife that day to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.
[00:39:33.077 --> 00:39:35.900]  Make you feel like you have no rights.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.783]  Perry says he always alerts TSA agents.
[00:39:38.863 --> 00:39:41.125]  And it doesn't matter if you have a medical card.
[00:39:41.165 --> 00:39:41.806]  They ignore that.
[00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.647]  These are mindless goons.
[00:39:44.727 --> 00:39:50.653]  And I hear local talk show hosts groveling and licking boots and having fetishes about being slaves.
[00:39:51.752 --> 00:39:55.533]  Do you understand foreign banks are now stealing all the major pension funds?
[00:39:55.553 --> 00:39:59.894]  Do you understand they've stolen six million veterans' death benefits, Bloomberg?
[00:39:59.914 --> 00:40:03.876]  Do you understand the Federal Reserve won't tell Congress where the trillions went?
[00:40:03.896 --> 00:40:09.737]  Do you understand that we're being gang-raped by corrupt people and they're training us to be slaves?
[00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:12.438]  Stop being gullible idiots!
[00:40:12.918 --> 00:40:14.899]  Read what the founding fathers said!
[00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:16.899]  A lot of these people are not Americans.
[00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:19.220]  America has become riddled
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.501]  With cowardly, sheep-like people that worship tyranny.
[00:40:23.001 --> 00:40:25.061]  Now, there are a lot of us left that are real Americans.
[00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:35.204]  But it's time for us to stand up to the bootlickers and the armies of minimum-wage bureaucrats who couldn't get a job cleaning toilets, and tell them, we're done, scum!
[00:40:36.184 --> 00:40:40.965]  We got 28,000 dead people on the U.S.-Mexican border in the last two years.
[00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:42.586]  That's more than died every year in Vietnam.
[00:40:44.686 --> 00:40:46.227]  It's around, what, 8,000-9,000 a year in Vietnam.
[00:40:48.598 --> 00:40:53.104]  That's, that's, what, 14, 15,000 dead a year?
[00:40:53.424 --> 00:40:56.929]  You never hear about that because they want to merge our countries under the SPP.
[00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.531]  Now let's go to this next clip.
[00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:02.496]  Here's a TSA agent going crazy saying they're God.
[00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:13.832]  Well, you can only get somebody who's a delusional, little pot-bellied wimp, now given incredible power to violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:41:14.192 --> 00:41:16.013]  You can only get them to violate people.
[00:41:16.033 --> 00:41:24.577]  I mean, I wonder how eight hours a day you walk up to TSA, and they've got these power trips, and they've got their hands behind their back, and they're staring at you.
[00:41:24.817 --> 00:41:30.300]  And I've seen them see a hot woman, and they'll run over and grab her like flies on you-know-what.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.941]  Just crawling all over them, getting off on it.
[00:41:33.341 --> 00:41:36.503]  Because these are people who can't get a woman.
[00:41:36.863 --> 00:41:38.024]  They don't have power.
[00:41:38.524 --> 00:41:40.185]  And the globalists know how to go higher.
[00:41:40.485 --> 00:41:43.367]  Powerless scum to rule over us.
[00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:45.488]  Don't you get it?
[00:41:45.748 --> 00:41:46.928]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:41:47.229 --> 00:41:51.451]  The big tyrants hire a bunch of monkeys to rule over us.
[00:41:51.851 --> 00:41:56.874]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip of one of these troglodytes saying they're God.
[00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:57.334]  Here it is.
[00:41:57.944 --> 00:42:00.585]  Colleen, let me set the scene for you for the latest incident.
[00:42:00.665 --> 00:42:10.109]  It was this past Sunday night here at LAX, about 7.30, probably crowded because a lot of people were coming home for the New Year's holiday, when suddenly a man starts acting strangely.
[00:42:10.169 --> 00:42:12.510]  He starts saying, I'm God, I'm in charge.
[00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:17.352]  LAX police and arrest that man, and he turns out to be a TSA agent.
[00:42:17.572 --> 00:42:18.353]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:42:19.193 --> 00:42:20.874]  So, he is God?
[00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:23.132]  He is God.
[00:42:23.632 --> 00:42:27.035]  When we come back, I'm going to play a clip from Friday with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:42:27.476 --> 00:42:32.200]  I was getting him on about his TV show, and he said, Alex, I want to make an announcement when we go live.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.521]  This is the end.
[00:42:34.082 --> 00:42:35.843]  I'm not going to be in the U.S., you know, anymore.
[00:42:35.903 --> 00:42:37.765]  I'm not going to be part of this.
[00:42:38.405 --> 00:42:39.767]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:40.868]  He goes, I'll say on air.
[00:42:40.888 --> 00:42:46.472]  And then he came on air and said, I can't do it anymore, Alex.
[00:42:47.847 --> 00:42:50.108]  I'm a governor, a former mayor, a Navy veteran.
[00:42:50.128 --> 00:42:52.329]  I can't have them do it to me anymore.
[00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:54.109]  I'm not flying anymore.
[00:42:54.469 --> 00:42:55.650]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.130]  Stay with us.
[00:42:58.711 --> 00:43:04.133]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:43:05.354 --> 00:43:10.115]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:43:10.495 --> 00:43:16.798]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:21.436]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:43:21.456 --> 00:43:25.668]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:31.614]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:43:32.314 --> 00:43:35.417]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:43:36.137 --> 00:43:36.958]  Others don't.
[00:43:37.378 --> 00:43:39.259]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:41.021]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:43:41.321 --> 00:43:43.883]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:43:44.203 --> 00:43:50.447]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:43:53.529 --> 00:43:55.571]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:43:55.891 --> 00:43:56.391]  Others don't.
[00:43:58.001 --> 00:44:04.470]  Hello, Alex Jones has told you about the delicious, safe, easy to fix, and very storable food from eFoods Direct.

[00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:15.116]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:46:15.417 --> 00:46:20.001]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:46:56.182 --> 00:46:56.642]  Thank you.
[00:46:59.104 --> 00:47:00.244]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:01.946]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:05.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:13.533 --> 00:47:14.534]  Big Brother.
[00:47:14.574 --> 00:47:17.317]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:17.337 --> 00:47:19.539]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.982]  You want answers?
[00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:24.824]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:24.885 --> 00:47:30.750]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:38.732 --> 00:47:44.794]  I believe that police state episode was so far the best that conspiracy theories ever put on air.
[00:47:45.534 --> 00:47:47.735]  Oh, I won't be that judgmental.
[00:47:47.815 --> 00:47:50.196]  I'm proud of all of them that we're putting on the air.
[00:47:50.256 --> 00:47:51.756]  You know, they're all different topics.
[00:47:51.776 --> 00:47:53.777]  They're all extremely interesting.
[00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:58.498]  And when you delve and get into them, they get even more interesting to do them.
[00:47:58.558 --> 00:48:02.219]  But Alex, I'm going to drop a bombshell on you today.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:03.640]  Okay.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.820]  And that is this.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.721]  It all may be coming to an end for me.
[00:48:10.777 --> 00:48:12.420]  And I haven't gone public with this.
[00:48:12.781 --> 00:48:13.883]  I saved it for you.
[00:48:15.245 --> 00:48:20.315]  Because of my respect for you, but it deals directly with what's going on with our airlines.
[00:48:20.455 --> 00:48:22.860]  As you know, I've had hip resurfacing done.
[00:48:24.022 --> 00:48:27.443]  So that every time I get on a plane, the buzzer goes off.
[00:48:28.184 --> 00:48:33.826]  Well now they've gone to this enhanced interrogation, or whatever they want to call it, enhanced searching.
[00:48:34.606 --> 00:48:37.848]  Alex, that guy in San Diego is completely correct.
[00:48:38.508 --> 00:48:43.550]  If they did this to you on the street, it would be considered a sexual attack.
[00:48:46.491 --> 00:48:47.111]  Absolutely.
[00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:50.693]  So I am refusing to fly commercial airlines anymore.
[00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:55.626]  I will not subject myself to this.
[00:48:55.786 --> 00:48:59.671]  I'm a governor, I'm a mayor, I'm a United States Navy veteran.
[00:49:00.372 --> 00:49:06.580]  I don't feel that I need to prove that I'm not a murderer and that I would hijack a plane or any such nonsense.
[00:49:08.055 --> 00:49:10.096]  And I will not subject myself.
[00:49:10.616 --> 00:49:19.538]  And the head of Homeland Security, Janet, or Napolitano, whatever her name was, her big quote yesterday was on this enhanced searching.
[00:49:20.418 --> 00:49:22.579]  She said, if you don't like it, don't fly.
[00:49:22.599 --> 00:49:27.000]  Well, that's the ultimatum she's given me, and I'm exercising it.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.481]  I will not fly on a commercial airliner again unless I change my mind.
[00:49:31.841 --> 00:49:32.101]  Wow.
[00:49:32.121 --> 00:49:32.821]  You know me.
[00:49:33.201 --> 00:49:34.982]  I don't change my mind too often.
[00:49:35.382 --> 00:49:39.765]  No you don't, and Governor, some stations don't carry this first segment.
[00:49:39.785 --> 00:49:42.687]  I want to come back and recap all this because that was on my list.
[00:49:42.727 --> 00:49:48.811]  I wanted to talk about the breaking, seriously historical transmission that we hope makes it on air tonight.
[00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:53.274]  Alright folks, that's part of my hour-long discussion with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:49:53.314 --> 00:49:58.898]  Hillary Clinton has told the Associated Press she doesn't want to go through pat-downs or the naked body scanners.
[00:50:00.162 --> 00:50:01.003]  Well, she doesn't have to.
[00:50:01.023 --> 00:50:03.645]  She flies around on government diplomatic jets.
[00:50:03.685 --> 00:50:09.351]  And that's another big issue that I've got Paul Watson riding on tomorrow at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:10.833 --> 00:50:19.201]  Federal employees, members of Congress, tens of thousands of U.N.
[00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:24.006]  diplomats and their staff are all exempt, even when they fly commercial.
[00:50:25.049 --> 00:50:26.470]  And that's how asinine it is.
[00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:43.998]  They have been grabbing the genitals of pilots now in the last month with these enhanced rape downs, this enhanced interrogation rape down, grope down, with the grope stopo, that's a word I just invented, instead of gestapo, it's the grope stopo, with the grope infurers.
[00:50:45.138 --> 00:50:46.078]  All of this is going on.
[00:50:46.579 --> 00:50:51.381]  You're going to trust a pilot and a co-pilot to have guns in the cockpit, to fly this giant
[00:50:52.739 --> 00:50:54.221]  You know, multi-thousand pound.
[00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:55.923]  How much does a 747 weigh?
[00:50:55.943 --> 00:50:56.904]  Look it up for me guys.
[00:50:57.364 --> 00:50:58.906]  The weight of a 747 or 777.
[00:50:59.407 --> 00:51:02.630]  I know it's something like 15, 20 tons or something.
[00:51:03.051 --> 00:51:06.995]  You're gonna trust them to fly this giant missile.
[00:51:09.138 --> 00:51:09.458]  But...
[00:51:10.427 --> 00:51:10.988]  They can't.
[00:51:11.528 --> 00:51:12.969]  They have to have their genitals grabbed.
[00:51:13.049 --> 00:51:13.950]  Come on, folks!
[00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:16.873]  We're not Land of the Cowards, Home of the Slaves!
[00:51:17.853 --> 00:51:19.074]  Whatever happened to America?
[00:51:19.095 --> 00:51:20.516]  You know, they say down the road.
[00:51:20.676 --> 00:51:24.940]  Oh, well, a few people tried to blow up planes, so they turned everything into a police state.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.642]  975,000 pounds.
[00:51:27.702 --> 00:51:28.322]  More than I thought.
[00:51:28.362 --> 00:51:29.063]  Is that a 747 or a 777?
[00:51:29.103 --> 00:51:30.404]  747 weighs 900 and what?
[00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:41.311]  975,000 pounds.
[00:51:41.771 --> 00:51:47.514]  So they're flying a 900,000 plus pound weapon.
[00:51:48.115 --> 00:51:49.656]  But their genitals have got to be grabbed.
[00:51:50.116 --> 00:51:51.196]  And that's in the news.
[00:51:51.717 --> 00:51:55.959]  And again, we were telling people this with our listeners calling in three, four weeks ago and people didn't believe it.
[00:51:56.319 --> 00:52:01.882]  Now these pilots are on mainstream news saying, yeah, they stick their hands in our pants and we're not flying.
[00:52:02.242 --> 00:52:05.044]  They tried to fire the first pilot a few months ago that said no.
[00:52:06.107 --> 00:52:09.909]  They tried to suspend others, and they all just said, you know what?
[00:52:09.949 --> 00:52:10.529]  We're done.
[00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:11.249]  We're done.
[00:52:11.289 --> 00:52:11.549]  Fine.
[00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:12.049]  We quit.
[00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.450]  And the government went, no, we're parasites.
[00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:16.011]  We want to just train you to be slaves.
[00:52:16.411 --> 00:52:17.171]  Don't rebel.
[00:52:17.872 --> 00:52:18.892]  We'll make it all better.
[00:52:19.112 --> 00:52:20.153]  You don't have to now.
[00:52:20.553 --> 00:52:21.833]  We'll just check your ID.
[00:52:22.213 --> 00:52:23.334]  That's totally reasonable.
[00:52:23.634 --> 00:52:25.075]  Check the ticket with the ID.
[00:52:25.515 --> 00:52:25.855]  Great.
[00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:32.872]  And again, if you really believe Muslim extremists did this, why aren't they being profiled?
[00:52:33.552 --> 00:52:38.555]  Because the government knows that most of these events are provocative or totally staged.
[00:52:38.995 --> 00:52:39.935]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:52:43.357 --> 00:52:48.799]  Two days before it was confirmed, I said, watch this German airliner with a dummy bomb on it.
[00:52:48.859 --> 00:52:50.160]  I said, A, it's going to be a dummy.
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:51.700]  B, it's going to be a drill.
[00:52:54.429 --> 00:53:03.216]  I happen to have the mainstream news articles right here in front of me dealing with this.
[00:53:04.237 --> 00:53:18.567]  And in those articles it states, Daily Mail and Associated Press, fake bomb aboard German passenger jet was made by US firm to test airport security.
[00:53:18.587 --> 00:53:21.870]  The US government was doing it.
[00:53:23.772 --> 00:53:27.134]  Remember a month ago to kick off this new round of dehumanization?
[00:53:29.155 --> 00:53:47.385]  Obama gets warned on the Thursday night that there's cartridge bombs coming from Anwar al-Awlaki, which is admitted to be CIA and protected, and now in the Major Hassan trial, the CIA is blocking the trial from getting that evidence.
[00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:53.866]  Because Hassan wants to use that in his trial, as lawyers do, that he was being handled by Anwar al-Awlaki.
[00:53:55.227 --> 00:53:55.788]  Out of Yemen.
[00:53:56.989 --> 00:53:58.370]  Just like the underwear bomber was.
[00:54:01.093 --> 00:54:08.260]  But going back to the printer cartridge bombs that kicked off the latest level of tyranny.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.321]  It's always more, more, more.
[00:54:09.361 --> 00:54:09.882]  More, more, more.
[00:54:10.657 --> 00:54:12.418]  I mean, what happens if terrorists bomb a mall?
[00:54:12.438 --> 00:54:14.339]  Well, the Feds have already said they want checkpoints in malls.
[00:54:14.639 --> 00:54:15.659]  What happens if they bomb a highway?
[00:54:15.699 --> 00:54:16.179]  Checkpoints.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.201]  This is the Feds' excuse to just take over everything.
[00:54:19.401 --> 00:54:26.764]  They're already training every local police department to, quote, fight local terrorists and roadside devices, but the script didn't, we're going to fight Muslims.
[00:54:27.044 --> 00:54:31.486]  The script is local returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:54:31.787 --> 00:54:33.287]  You see how this is being set up?
[00:54:33.847 --> 00:54:35.868]  Are you smart enough to get this, new listeners?
[00:54:36.188 --> 00:54:36.989]  I think you are.
[00:54:39.847 --> 00:54:46.193]  You are the target because they know you're not going to go along with Obamacare and open borders and this corporate global government.
[00:54:47.594 --> 00:54:49.576]  It's not socialist, it's fascist.
[00:54:50.016 --> 00:54:54.420]  They socialize your wealth to make you controllable, so you're under their control.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:01.746]  But going back to a month ago, the British test the cartridge bombs that the U.S.
[00:55:01.786 --> 00:55:02.367]  warns them about.
[00:55:02.407 --> 00:55:03.187]  They're not bombs.
[00:55:04.397 --> 00:55:06.039]  They come out and say they're not explosive.
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.565]  And Obama comes out and gives a press conference and says, yes, they are bombs.
[00:55:10.706 --> 00:55:11.508]  Check them again.
[00:55:12.429 --> 00:55:13.170]  How did he know?
[00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.635]  The British go and check and go, okay, you're the president, you say so.
[00:55:18.295 --> 00:55:18.995]  They are bombs.
[00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:19.656]  We were wrong.
[00:55:19.996 --> 00:55:23.419]  I mean, they can't even get their scripting right on this.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:30.426]  And so, I'm here to tell you, they're getting ready to stage terror attacks to blame it on the Tea Party and patriots in this country.
[00:55:30.806 --> 00:55:32.728]  And it's not just Alex Jones saying that now.
[00:55:33.108 --> 00:55:35.210]  A lot of big national radio hosts are saying it.
[00:55:35.651 --> 00:55:38.213]  Beck and Savage.
[00:55:38.473 --> 00:55:40.595]  And you know why they're finally forced to tell the truth?
[00:55:40.755 --> 00:55:42.297]  Because this time they're going to be blamed.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:51.125]  Yeah, how do you like it, conservative talk show host, when the feds blew Oklahoma City sky high when they blamed it on Rush Limbaugh on talk radio?
[00:55:53.186 --> 00:55:59.351]  But this time they've got the FCC, and I've got the FCC in the news today saying they want to shut down free speech on talk radio.
[00:55:59.651 --> 00:56:01.252]  These people aren't playing games!
[00:56:03.594 --> 00:56:04.635]  It's time to grow up!
[00:56:08.769 --> 00:56:13.051]  So I'm here to tell you, they're going to pull some staged stuff on airplanes to say, see, we told you so.
[00:56:13.331 --> 00:56:15.712]  And we've got to respond by saying, you're staging this.
[00:56:16.192 --> 00:56:20.193]  Anwar al-Awlaki behind all of this is secretly hanging out at the Pentagon.
[00:56:20.233 --> 00:56:21.414]  Source Fox News AP.
[00:56:23.211 --> 00:56:32.854]  And over and over again, government stage events, from Hitler firebombing as Reichstag, to what the Soviets did, to what our own government did, Gulf of Tonkin, and Operation Northwoods and Operation Ajax.
[00:56:33.234 --> 00:56:35.134]  If you don't know what those are, check them out.
[00:56:35.454 --> 00:56:36.875]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:56:37.155 --> 00:56:38.775]  Buy the high-quality DVDs.

[00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:47.618]  Films like Terror Storm, history government-sponsored terrorism, Truth Rising,
[00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:52.414]  Follow The Republic, The Obama Deception, Infowars.com.
[00:56:52.494 --> 00:56:53.756]  Show them to your friends and family.
[00:56:54.516 --> 00:56:55.077]  Educate them.
[00:56:55.357 --> 00:56:56.678]  People are ready to hear the truth.
[00:56:56.979 --> 00:56:57.419]  Check it now.
[00:56:57.439 --> 00:56:57.939]  We're coming up.
[00:56:57.959 --> 00:56:58.900]  We're going to open the phones up.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:56:58.960]  888-201-2244.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.020]  888-201-2244.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:56:59.921]  But how much do we got to take?
[00:57:06.212 --> 00:57:24.792]  Women having their breasts fondled, having their artificial breasts pulled out, people having their colostomy bags ripped out of them, humiliating them, TSA laughing, planting cocaine on women they want to have sex with, TSA fondling children, grabbing babies' genitals, naked body scanning, recording people.
[00:57:25.112 --> 00:57:26.594]  They claim they're not saving the images.
[00:57:26.634 --> 00:57:28.136]  They got caught lying about that.
[00:57:28.536 --> 00:57:29.517]  Come on, folks!
[00:57:29.737 --> 00:57:32.380]  We got a government that shoots people up in the U.S.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.744]  and overseas with live syphilis, telling them it's a vaccine.
[00:57:36.164 --> 00:57:39.448]  It came out last week, the government puts uranium in your drinking water.
[00:57:40.209 --> 00:57:41.691]  Stop trusting the government!
[00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:45.635]  They're run by a bunch of psycho, control freak, scumbag, parasite trash!
[00:57:45.835 --> 00:57:46.276]  Stay with us!
[00:57:48.166 --> 00:57:52.410]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:53.330]  Number one.
[00:57:53.631 --> 00:57:56.793]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:57.053 --> 00:57:57.634]  Number two.
[00:57:57.914 --> 00:58:02.478]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:02.818 --> 00:58:03.259]  It's true.
[00:58:03.559 --> 00:58:08.123]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:08.423 --> 00:58:08.984]  Number three.
[00:58:09.264 --> 00:58:12.547]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:12.847 --> 00:58:16.550]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:17.290]  Number 4.
[00:58:17.531 --> 00:58:19.892]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:20.293 --> 00:58:23.675]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:23.975 --> 00:58:24.515]  Number 5.
[00:58:24.756 --> 00:58:28.678]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:28.919 --> 00:58:33.682]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:58:33.962 --> 00:58:37.987]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:38.127 --> 00:58:39.689]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:39.929 --> 00:58:41.992]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:58:42.172 --> 00:58:44.535]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:58:49.238 --> 00:58:52.902]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:53.262 --> 00:58:56.266]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:56.506 --> 00:59:01.291]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:59:01.311 --> 00:59:07.578]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:07.698 --> 00:59:09.941]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:10.461 --> 00:59:10.761]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:11.201]  Bernanke?
[00:59:11.282 --> 00:59:11.922]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:11.962 --> 00:59:13.223]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:13.243 --> 00:59:15.484]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:29.372 --> 00:59:31.213]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:31.493 --> 00:59:36.315]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:36.656 --> 00:59:46.580]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:49.162 --> 00:59:52.123]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:52.743 --> 00:59:55.945]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:59:58.655 --> 01:00:00.836]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:04.259]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.305 --> 01:00:17.927]  Okay, your phone calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:18.327 --> 01:00:19.468]  The phone lines are open.
[01:00:19.488 --> 01:00:19.548]  888-201-2244.
[01:00:19.568 --> 01:00:19.708]  888-201-2244.
[01:00:19.808 --> 01:00:22.650]  And we'll get you up and on air.
[01:00:29.702 --> 01:00:35.287]  Later in the hour, I'm going to get into web censorship bill sales through the Senate.
[01:00:37.249 --> 01:00:42.714]  We've got the fact that it's the one-year anniversary this week of the Climategate situation.
[01:00:43.735 --> 01:00:54.444]  We've got about a week and a half, because they're waiting until after next week with Thanksgiving, to try to pass the full food safety bill.
[01:00:55.438 --> 01:01:01.043]  You gotta love these Orwellian names, written by big agribusiness, where most of the food safety issues come from.
[01:01:01.063 --> 01:01:10.913]  I mean, you've got big pharma with over 350,000 deaths a year from bad drug interactions or their drugs killing people.
[01:01:11.453 --> 01:01:13.315]  Put that 350,000 on a problem.
[01:01:13.756 --> 01:01:16.418]  The issue is, men with turbans, they might get us.
[01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:18.460]  Uh, so it's just amazing.
[01:01:19.101 --> 01:01:24.447]  Talking about medical malpractice, maybe we need the TSA there to protect us from our doctors.
[01:01:25.007 --> 01:01:27.009]  Well, the doctors at least have high IQs.
[01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:32.976]  Now we have TSA, you know, again, messing with people's medical sutures, demanding bandages be taken off.
[01:01:33.376 --> 01:01:34.838]  I mean, this is just insane, folks.
[01:01:34.898 --> 01:01:36.560]  It's like living in a Supermax prison.
[01:01:37.512 --> 01:01:41.896]  Minor procedure turns into double amputation for New York City woman.
[01:01:42.376 --> 01:01:44.778]  She went in to have her stomach worked on.
[01:01:44.799 --> 01:01:46.100]  They cut off both her legs.
[01:01:47.201 --> 01:01:49.363]  So that's the government for you.
[01:01:50.944 --> 01:01:52.025]  Government-run health care.
[01:01:53.066 --> 01:01:56.749]  So that's just some of what is coming up today.
[01:01:56.769 --> 01:02:00.052]  I also have some financial news that we're going to be discussing.
[01:02:00.152 --> 01:02:04.216]  Geithner warns Republicans against politicizing the Fed.
[01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:08.056]  Politicizing the Fed?
[01:02:08.096 --> 01:02:09.703]  I mean, you've gotta love...
[01:02:10.734 --> 01:02:26.503]  In fact, let's try to pull that clip up for later in the hour, where former head of the private Federal Reserve, Greenspan, tells Laird NewsHour that the Fed is above the law and outside government, and government has no authority over it.
[01:02:27.263 --> 01:02:28.244]  That's just made up!
[01:02:28.264 --> 01:02:33.787]  You've got private bank consortium creating tens of trillions of dollars for themselves at our expense.
[01:02:34.067 --> 01:02:36.509]  We've got to pay our tax money into the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.484]  The President's not above the law.
[01:02:39.886 --> 01:02:41.732]  The Congress isn't above the law.
[01:02:42.896 --> 01:02:48.419]  Nothing is above the law, but the Federal Reserve claims that it is above the law.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.120]  And again, we're going to get your calls.
[01:02:50.741 --> 01:02:53.562]  We're going to get your calls up and on the board and ready.
[01:02:54.063 --> 01:02:58.605]  The number is 888-201-2244 because I really want to go to those.
[01:02:58.665 --> 01:03:00.586]  And we open the phones up and we're going to get to those.
[01:03:00.607 --> 01:03:07.911]  If you've been trying to call in, we've got the phone system open for you right there so you can get up and on the air.
[01:03:09.522 --> 01:03:11.203]  Our phone system was down until just now.
[01:03:11.243 --> 01:03:13.524]  That's why I'm saying that you can now call in 888-201-2244.
[01:03:15.305 --> 01:03:16.366]  I didn't know it was turned off.
[01:03:16.386 --> 01:03:25.471]  We've got it turned on now if you want to try to get on air with us here coming up after this quick break.
[01:03:25.511 --> 01:03:26.712]  So that's just some of what's coming up.
[01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:34.752]  The reason I've been covering this TSA situation at nauseam is, going back almost a month ago now, I saw a chink in their armor.
[01:03:35.372 --> 01:03:39.433]  I knew that we could have a major effect on the globalists.
[01:03:40.013 --> 01:03:42.094]  I knew that we could resist them.
[01:03:42.894 --> 01:03:50.096]  I knew that what they were doing was outrageous and that the TSA takeover was very important for their psychological warfare program.
[01:03:50.496 --> 01:03:55.518]  That they had to break our will, to train us that we have no dignity, no rights, and that if we could
[01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:02.014]  Give that anger a place to erupt, it would spread like wildfire everywhere, and it has.
[01:04:02.675 --> 01:04:08.279]  Most of the polls in Reuters and other places show over 90% against the TSA and what they're doing.
[01:04:08.299 --> 01:04:09.900]  People just say, look, I don't want any security.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.901]  I'll take the risk.
[01:04:11.321 --> 01:04:14.383]  They've got a CBS poll, classic disinfo outfit.
[01:04:14.423 --> 01:04:17.566]  It's CBS that tells you that mercury is good for your child's brain.
[01:04:17.586 --> 01:04:18.566]  Remember that clip we played?
[01:04:18.987 --> 01:04:20.067]  Mercury's now nutritious.
[01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:23.110]  They say, oh, 82% of Americans love it.
[01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:24.475]  They love the scanners.
[01:04:24.516 --> 01:04:25.400]  They love Chertoff.
[01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.170]  They, you know, they love all of this.
[01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:36.621]  So I want to get your take on this, the economy, and so many other issues after this quick break when we come back at 888-201-2244.
[01:04:37.262 --> 01:04:43.526]  And we will continue with the other important things that are developing while we're busy watching this TSA.
[01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:49.211]  But the TSA is not a diversion because it's about us coming together and saying no.
[01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:53.554]  And once we have a victory on one front, people then learn they can have victories on many fronts.
[01:04:53.794 --> 01:04:56.016]  We're learning how to win right now together.
[01:04:58.973 --> 01:05:02.596]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:02.936 --> 01:05:11.063]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:11.803 --> 01:05:15.846]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:16.427 --> 01:05:27.256]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:27.876 --> 01:05:36.879]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:37.379 --> 01:05:42.441]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:42.801 --> 01:05:49.984]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:50.304 --> 01:05:53.045]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:09.971]  This is our land.
[01:06:12.832 --> 01:06:14.393]  These are our people.
[01:06:16.154 --> 01:06:16.895]  The workers.
[01:06:16.995 --> 01:06:19.936]  The strivers.
[01:06:20.016 --> 01:06:22.618]  The builders.
[01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:26.100]  These are our people.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.221]  Who are they?
[01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:31.588]  They are the Dark Armies.
[01:06:32.308 --> 01:06:36.292]  The Dark Murdering Armies, whose only honor is atrocity.
[01:06:36.332 --> 01:06:36.992]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:37.192 --> 01:06:39.394]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:56.141 --> 01:06:59.563]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Sunday transmission.
[01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:02.385]  Your phone calls are coming up here in just moments.
[01:07:03.426 --> 01:07:10.030]  I want to get into the economy, the web censorship bill, the federal government putting fake bombs on German planes.
[01:07:10.391 --> 01:07:11.511]  They got to make us submit.
[01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:12.712]  Caught red-handed there.
[01:07:13.573 --> 01:07:17.135]  It's all coming up, but I want to explain something.
[01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:19.597]  No one in government has immunity.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:35.787]  They tell you they have immunity, but I had the DA on from San Mateo County, and that's the county where the San Francisco airport's at, and I said, sir, correct me if I'm wrong, but police don't really have immunity, and feds don't have immunity.
[01:07:36.468 --> 01:07:39.509]  The claim of immunity is when they're doing their duties properly.
[01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:43.371]  They have immunity under law, because they're in the right.
[01:07:43.691 --> 01:07:44.832]  He said, you're absolutely right.
[01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:46.693]  I said, here's another analogy.
[01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:48.694]  If somebody's breaking in my house,
[01:07:49.801 --> 01:07:52.343]  At 3 a.m., endangering my family.
[01:07:52.404 --> 01:07:53.585]  I have a right to blow him away.
[01:07:54.465 --> 01:07:55.446]  That's not immunity.
[01:07:55.867 --> 01:07:56.808]  It's that I'm in the right.
[01:07:56.868 --> 01:07:58.609]  He says, you are absolutely correct.
[01:07:59.891 --> 01:08:05.396]  Because over the last 15 years on air, I've probably interviewed constitutional scholars and common law scholars hundreds of times.
[01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:05.896]  I know this.
[01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:06.557]  I've studied the law.
[01:08:08.018 --> 01:08:10.759]  But they tell these bureaucrats you're above the law.
[01:08:10.859 --> 01:08:12.179]  You are not above the law!
[01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:22.222]  Tell that to the cop that shot the handcuffed black man last year in the back and then lied about it and said the guy attacked him but video caught it in San Francisco.
[01:08:22.282 --> 01:08:23.522]  That cop just went to jail.
[01:08:23.862 --> 01:08:24.703]  Does he have immunity?
[01:08:25.003 --> 01:08:25.563]  No he doesn't.
[01:08:27.063 --> 01:08:29.504]  Now a sworn police officer who's had training
[01:08:31.365 --> 01:08:36.751]  Unless there's an emergency situation, an arrest situation, they're not allowed to stick their hands down your pants.
[01:08:37.511 --> 01:08:44.559]  And if they have a chance, they are by law and by code, federal and state, they've got to get a same gender to do it.
[01:08:46.941 --> 01:08:47.742]  Not in this case.
[01:08:47.962 --> 01:08:50.044]  And let me explain something for those of you that are in denial.
[01:08:51.005 --> 01:08:53.388]  They are now sticking their hands down your pants.
[01:08:54.673 --> 01:08:57.595]  And they admit they're doing it to intimidate you to go through the scanners.
[01:08:57.876 --> 01:08:58.957]  But they say that doesn't matter.
[01:08:59.337 --> 01:09:01.799]  Next, they're going to pat you down on top of the scanners.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.542]  And some people are like, get over it, man.
[01:09:05.902 --> 01:09:06.943]  What do you have to hide?
[01:09:07.223 --> 01:09:08.084]  Oh, what's next?
[01:09:08.965 --> 01:09:14.670]  Can I stick my hand down the minimum wage McDonald's worker, now TSA federal god?
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:16.471]  Can I stick my hands down their pants?
[01:09:16.711 --> 01:09:17.452]  Not that I want to.
[01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:19.654]  No, I'd be sent to prison for five years.
[01:09:21.641 --> 01:09:25.851]  If a cop was randomly in a park shaking his hands down people's pants, he'd go to prison.
[01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:31.311]  Police now staking out California airports to catch TSA goons.
[01:09:31.331 --> 01:09:35.233]  Appearing on the Alex Jones Show, current Chief Deputy D.A.
[01:09:35.273 --> 01:09:36.013]  and incoming D.A.
[01:09:36.053 --> 01:09:49.838]  of San Mateo County, Steve Wagstaff, said his office will prosecute TSA employees who engage in lewd or lavacious behavior while conducting homeland security mandated pat-downs at the San Francisco International Airport in San Mateo County.
[01:09:50.298 --> 01:09:51.118]  And it went on from there.
[01:09:51.138 --> 01:09:52.399]  He says they're sending their deputies in.
[01:09:54.605 --> 01:10:01.310]  See, these little toilet attendants, these little TSA workers who couldn't get a job anywhere else, they can't even engage in an arrest.
[01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:08.735]  They are literally the equivalent of Walmart greeters that can stick their hands down your pants or pull your colostomy bag out of your side.
[01:10:09.721 --> 01:10:10.541]  This is in the news.
[01:10:10.901 --> 01:10:13.562]  And when they do it, it's in the news.
[01:10:13.582 --> 01:10:14.602]  People say, please don't pull that.
[01:10:14.622 --> 01:10:15.463]  It's a colostomy bag.
[01:10:15.483 --> 01:10:16.823]  They're like, what's that?
[01:10:17.183 --> 01:10:19.104]  They're like, listen, I have a medical card.
[01:10:19.404 --> 01:10:20.564]  That's a colostomy bag.
[01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:21.305]  Do you understand?
[01:10:22.045 --> 01:10:24.405]  That's the feces from inside me.
[01:10:26.426 --> 01:10:26.986]  They just pull it.
[01:10:27.446 --> 01:10:28.647]  Look, poopy!
[01:10:29.147 --> 01:10:30.927]  I mean, I'm sorry, but that's what they do.
[01:10:31.007 --> 01:10:32.188]  Same thing with the urine bags.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.041]  What's this?
[01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:35.022]  That's a catheter.
[01:10:35.602 --> 01:10:37.364]  I have bladder cancer.
[01:10:37.844 --> 01:10:38.825]  Catheter!
[01:10:39.766 --> 01:10:43.510]  I mean, literally with the blood and everything.
[01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:46.112]  Like a demonic monkey pulling it out of you.
[01:10:46.413 --> 01:10:49.556]  And they're like, our TSA people are professionals.
[01:10:49.876 --> 01:10:51.998]  We do pull the catheters out.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.862]  I mean, there's a bag with urine in it.
[01:10:56.122 --> 01:10:56.822]  What that?
[01:10:57.847 --> 01:11:03.473]  How many times do you see it in the news where a woman has her pump breast milk and they go, cannot bring liquid then?
[01:11:05.074 --> 01:11:06.936]  And you're like, but it's for my baby.
[01:11:07.436 --> 01:11:08.798]  Maybe I can't though.
[01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:13.702]  And you're like, well, I understand that, but... Drink it then!
[01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:14.924]  Drink it!
[01:11:15.284 --> 01:11:16.005]  Drink the milk!
[01:11:18.132 --> 01:11:18.953]  I have power!
[01:11:19.673 --> 01:11:20.354]  I have power!
[01:11:20.374 --> 01:11:21.195]  In fact, cue that back up.
[01:11:21.655 --> 01:11:22.556]  I have power!
[01:11:23.277 --> 01:11:31.864]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, an army of low IQ people on power trips, and you're like, don't talk bad about them, don't make fun of them like they're stupid.
[01:11:32.385 --> 01:11:35.968]  It's okay that they're harassing old people and pulling colostomy bags and catheters out.
[01:11:37.489 --> 01:11:39.931]  It's okay if they're going into medical sutures.
[01:11:40.031 --> 01:11:41.112]  It's to keep us safe!
[01:11:41.433 --> 01:11:42.974]  The Muslims are so scary!
[01:11:43.034 --> 01:11:45.016]  That's why the borders are wide open for them.
[01:11:46.755 --> 01:11:47.876]  That's all a big sick joke.
[01:11:47.896 --> 01:11:51.980]  You're being trained how to be a slave so they can take your pension fund and everything you got.
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.542]  But you'll laugh now, you won't laugh later.
[01:11:54.802 --> 01:11:58.686]  That's why so many people listen to the show now, because they used to laugh, now they don't.
[01:11:59.006 --> 01:12:06.132]  And the most gullible in society, still toady and get off on licking boots and love going along with the system.
[01:12:06.392 --> 01:12:06.873]  Great!
[01:12:07.193 --> 01:12:09.055]  You're going to lose everything you got, cowards!
[01:12:09.295 --> 01:12:10.316]  You killed America!
[01:12:10.716 --> 01:12:12.558]  Ryan in South Dakota, you're on the air.
[01:12:15.334 --> 01:12:16.135]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:12:16.175 --> 01:12:16.716]  Can you hear me?
[01:12:16.736 --> 01:12:17.196]  Yes, I can.
[01:12:17.216 --> 01:12:17.897]  Go ahead, Ryan.
[01:12:19.218 --> 01:12:23.021]  Yeah, hey, you're doing a heck of a job there, my friend.
[01:12:24.483 --> 01:12:31.750]  I've been listening to you for about two years, and actually I just got on the internet here about two and a half years ago, so...
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.482]  I'm finally getting woke up just a little bit.
[01:12:35.662 --> 01:12:37.263]  Well, we won't be there long.
[01:12:37.303 --> 01:12:43.747]  Cass Sunstein, publicly the head of the White House regulations, says he wants to shut down free speech and ban criticism of government.
[01:12:44.308 --> 01:12:45.749]  But I guess that's to fight Al Qaeda.
[01:12:45.769 --> 01:12:46.729]  What's wrong with that, Ryan?
[01:12:49.891 --> 01:12:50.452]  Right on.
[01:12:53.173 --> 01:12:56.616]  You know, speaking of these here travelers and these airlines and stuff,
[01:12:57.421 --> 01:13:00.223]  You know, I haven't flown for about 22 years.
[01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:05.808]  It's been since I was in the National Guard, Army National Guard, and the Navy, of course, back in the 60s.
[01:13:05.828 --> 01:13:06.889]  Hold on, you were in the Guard?
[01:13:06.929 --> 01:13:09.952]  According to the Homeland Security Mike reports, you're the number one enemy of America.
[01:13:09.972 --> 01:13:10.572]  I'm not joking.
[01:13:10.792 --> 01:13:12.074]  The government says you're a terrorist.
[01:13:12.094 --> 01:13:13.735]  Of course, I think that makes them the terrorists.
[01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:16.818]  I guess they are the terrorists, but I'm sorry, Ryan, go ahead.
[01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:18.719]  Yeah, right.
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.642]  At the time, I don't even own a weapon.
[01:13:21.682 --> 01:13:23.724]  I got me a baseball bat, and that's about it.
[01:13:24.992 --> 01:13:26.238]  So what's on your mind today, Ryan?
[01:13:31.437 --> 01:13:33.318]  Well, I just wanted to make a comment.
[01:13:33.338 --> 01:13:40.502]  You know, what is the big deal that all these people have got to be traveling so much?
[01:13:40.863 --> 01:13:46.686]  Why can't they just stay home for the holidays and boycott these airlines for a couple of days?
[01:13:46.726 --> 01:13:49.288]  Well, here's the problem, and I appreciate your call.
[01:13:49.328 --> 01:13:50.048]  Great points, Ryan.
[01:13:50.068 --> 01:13:50.688]  Good to hear from you.
[01:13:50.969 --> 01:13:57.552]  I want to go to Charles, Donna, Don, Tom, Ronnie, and others, and I'm going to try to shut up and actually get to your calls after this break coming up in a minute.
[01:13:58.613 --> 01:14:00.554]  But since he brought that point, I want to cover it now.
[01:14:00.874 --> 01:14:06.676]  I am not just supporting National Opt Out Day, where you say I'm not going to be radiated.
[01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:14.060]  They're now trying to intimidate people and threaten to arrest them if you don't let them grab your genitals.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.921]  But when they do that, they're going to lose in court.
[01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:21.493]  So let them try to threaten you with $11,000 civil fines.
[01:14:21.553 --> 01:14:22.313]  It's all bluster.
[01:14:22.934 --> 01:14:23.394]  Opt out.
[01:14:23.554 --> 01:14:24.094]  That's good.
[01:14:24.274 --> 01:14:25.495]  Be polite, but point out.
[01:14:26.135 --> 01:14:31.178]  Look, district attorneys have said you're going to be charged if you touch my genitals.
[01:14:31.238 --> 01:14:33.879]  It's misdemeanor through the pants, felony inside the pants.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.622]  So I'm telling you not to do it, but if you do it, I'm going to file charges.
[01:14:39.362 --> 01:14:40.223]  And it's already beginning.
[01:14:41.445 --> 01:14:48.067]  Now the Feds will just put a bomb on a plane, but that's why we... See, they've got us checkmated if we don't expose the fact that they're really the one stage in this.
[01:14:48.707 --> 01:14:51.248]  Or they'll keep doing it as the pretext to take over our lives.
[01:14:52.528 --> 01:14:58.650]  But for the airlines, the head of British Airways a month and a half ago came out and said, get the naked body scanners out.
[01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:00.551]  The Italian government said, get them out.
[01:15:01.051 --> 01:15:04.452]  And so, the globalists mailed a few printer cartridges out to scare everybody.
[01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:08.967]  They've had major airline heads here say, get it out, it's killing tourism.
[01:15:09.827 --> 01:15:24.414]  They have, last Friday, not this Friday, but last Friday, about eight, nine days ago, the heads of the biggest tourism lobbies, the head of the Airline Pilots Association, they went and said, look, don't do this.
[01:15:25.055 --> 01:15:26.215]  This is killing theme parks.
[01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:28.136]  This is losing billions of dollars a month.
[01:15:28.216 --> 01:15:29.497]  It was $9 billion a year.
[01:15:29.917 --> 01:15:31.998]  Now they're estimating it's going to be over $40 billion a year.
[01:15:32.718 --> 01:15:33.259]  Reuters is.
[01:15:34.315 --> 01:15:34.976]  They don't care.
[01:15:35.076 --> 01:15:36.898]  The Feds don't care if you don't fly.
[01:15:36.998 --> 01:15:40.782]  Actually, the environmentalists say they want all travel non-essential banned.
[01:15:41.823 --> 01:15:43.905]  They want to bankrupt the airlines and nationalize them.
[01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:46.047]  So we don't want them to do this slowly.
[01:15:46.067 --> 01:15:51.092]  We want to face them down now, panic them, to make industry force them to stop it.
[01:15:51.473 --> 01:15:53.675]  We'll be right back with Charles and others.
[01:15:53.695 --> 01:15:54.175]  Stay with us.
[01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:55.136]  But good idea.
[01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.438]  Boycott flying.
[01:15:56.498 --> 01:15:57.299]  I'm not flying anywhere.
[01:16:01.773 --> 01:16:02.354]  Action!
[01:16:02.374 --> 01:16:03.315]  Tyranny is here.
[01:16:03.655 --> 01:16:07.219]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:16:07.519 --> 01:16:09.801]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:16:09.821 --> 01:16:15.266]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:16:15.687 --> 01:16:21.913]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:27.877]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:31.979]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.502]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:16:36.782 --> 01:16:42.306]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:16:42.726 --> 01:16:45.888]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:16:46.288 --> 01:16:47.689]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:16:48.269 --> 01:16:48.690]  It's here.

[01:17:47.339 --> 01:17:50.121]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:17:57.844 --> 01:18:02.067]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:02.387 --> 01:18:02.668]  Number 1.
[01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:06.470]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:06.731 --> 01:18:07.291]  Number 2.
[01:18:07.591 --> 01:18:12.135]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:18:12.475 --> 01:18:12.935]  It's true.
[01:18:13.215 --> 01:18:17.799]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:18:18.099 --> 01:18:18.639]  Number 3.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.202]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:22.502 --> 01:18:26.205]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:18:26.405 --> 01:18:26.965]  Number four.
[01:18:27.205 --> 01:18:29.566]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:18:29.966 --> 01:18:33.347]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:18:33.647 --> 01:18:34.188]  Number five.
[01:18:34.428 --> 01:18:38.349]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:18:38.569 --> 01:18:43.350]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:18:43.631 --> 01:18:47.672]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:19:56.078 --> 01:19:56.518]  Thank you.
[01:19:59.079 --> 01:20:00.240]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.060]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.862]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:15.051 --> 01:20:16.952]  He's yelling, I have power!
[01:20:17.293 --> 01:20:18.053]  I have power!
[01:20:18.453 --> 01:20:19.214]  I have power!
[01:20:19.794 --> 01:20:25.818]  The power to stop him from flying to Florida with his wife that day to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.
[01:20:26.378 --> 01:20:29.140]  Make you feel like you have no rights.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:34.283]  Perry says he always alerts TSA agents about... No more Mr. Nice Guy from the TSA!
[01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:42.506]  Meanwhile, the federal government admits 350 plus thousand bad drug interactions, killing people a year.
[01:20:43.346 --> 01:20:48.688]  Over 300,000 botched surgeries, like this one from CBS News.
[01:20:49.508 --> 01:20:53.509]  Woman went in for a minor gynecological procedure.
[01:20:54.009 --> 01:20:56.170]  Young woman, they chopped off both her legs.
[01:20:58.493 --> 01:20:59.573]  But that's not a problem.
[01:20:59.653 --> 01:21:02.974]  Hundreds of thousands dying in botched surgeries and bad drugs.
[01:21:03.574 --> 01:21:03.874]  No!
[01:21:04.754 --> 01:21:05.074]  No!
[01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:08.155]  A few people die a year from terrorists.
[01:21:08.355 --> 01:21:09.255]  Oh my gosh!
[01:21:09.295 --> 01:21:10.475]  Let's give up all our rights.
[01:21:10.535 --> 01:21:11.276]  It's so scary.
[01:21:11.736 --> 01:21:13.676]  And during the break they had television on.
[01:21:13.696 --> 01:21:15.276]  I was seeing ads for TV shows.
[01:21:16.117 --> 01:21:21.798]  And it was all about terrorist attacking and all the different television programs and the cops keeping us safe.
[01:21:21.838 --> 01:21:22.558]  Give me a break!
[01:21:23.928 --> 01:21:24.909]  It's elementary!
[01:21:24.949 --> 01:21:26.329]  The government's run by criminals!
[01:21:26.349 --> 01:21:27.550]  They're staging the terror!
[01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:28.830]  Come on!
[01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:29.891]  Wake up, people!
[01:21:30.711 --> 01:21:31.652]  You're the target!
[01:21:31.672 --> 01:21:33.973]  And the good news is, people are starting to get that.
[01:21:34.013 --> 01:21:35.414]  They know the borders are wide open.
[01:21:35.894 --> 01:21:37.555]  They know the government ships in the drugs.
[01:21:37.595 --> 01:21:38.755]  They know the government's corrupt.
[01:21:39.195 --> 01:21:41.897]  Charles in Louisiana, what's your view on all this?
[01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:43.558]  How you doing, my friend?
[01:21:43.578 --> 01:21:44.058]  Let me say hello.
[01:21:44.138 --> 01:21:44.959]  It's been a while.
[01:21:45.079 --> 01:21:46.100]  It's hard to get in.
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:47.621]  My view is this.
[01:21:47.781 --> 01:21:56.167]  I've been through all this for years, and I don't know how parents could let their kids be molested in plain sight for an airplane ticket.
[01:21:56.727 --> 01:21:58.969]  You've got to really want to fly bad.
[01:21:59.269 --> 01:22:02.692]  It's a form of prostitution, what it is, for an airplane ticket, to me.
[01:22:03.112 --> 01:22:13.158]  Well, I gotta tell you, watching this video of this TSA guy with this five-year-old boy, they pull his shirt off and then squeeze his body and then run their hands over his head.
[01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:20.683]  I mean, let me tell you, you couldn't pay me a million bucks to do that, and that TSA worker looks like he's having a good time.
[01:22:21.483 --> 01:22:28.007]  I don't know about the rest of the American people, but I wouldn't put my hand... I know there's gonna be a fight right there, I'd probably go to jail.
[01:22:28.288 --> 01:22:31.450]  But everybody wants a pirate... No, no, no!
[01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:36.733]  Last week they tried to pull a guy's colostomy bag out of him, and he punched the guy, and he's going to jail!
[01:22:37.033 --> 01:22:38.414]  Remember earlier this year?
[01:22:38.794 --> 01:22:42.437]  The other TSA worker, they kept making fun of the size of his body part every day?
[01:22:42.777 --> 01:22:44.358]  So he punched his boss in the nose?
[01:22:44.638 --> 01:22:45.519]  He went to prison!
[01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:52.766]  One little girl up here come from Texas and she yelled in the airport, I'm being touched, don't touch me, I'm being touched.
[01:22:53.066 --> 01:22:57.067]  And then when she come home, the little girl, it took her five hours to calm down.
[01:22:57.087 --> 01:22:58.708]  She was 11 years old.
[01:22:58.788 --> 01:23:00.209]  She knows she was being touched.
[01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:03.570]  My God, the child was raked in plain view in a parish.
[01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:04.571]  What do you got to do there?
[01:23:04.851 --> 01:23:08.092]  I said, no, I wouldn't, you know, get a train, get a plane.
[01:23:08.112 --> 01:23:12.174]  Well, Charles, the feds are setting a precedent.
[01:23:13.086 --> 01:23:17.591]  To do what even sworn law enforcement officers who are bonded can't do.
[01:23:18.032 --> 01:23:19.514]  The feds are setting the precedent.
[01:23:19.554 --> 01:23:20.755]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:23:21.176 --> 01:23:26.782]  And Chertoff can make millions of dollars as the head of Homeland Security ordering the machines and now the head of the company.
[01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:28.284]  But for those that don't know Charles...
[01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:30.966]  Charles has been listening about 13 years.
[01:23:31.726 --> 01:23:38.450]  Charles was the first person as a rescue worker in Katrina to tell us the police machine-gunned all those people on that bridge.
[01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:44.433]  He saw it happen and it came out years later that it was true and the cops went to jail.
[01:23:45.033 --> 01:23:52.918]  But the point is, Charles, you described the feds and the police demanding a little sugar from the women to be rescued.
[01:23:53.858 --> 01:23:57.340]  If you were thirsty and you showed a brawl, you got one bottle of water.
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:00.702]  And if you lift the brawl up, you got two bottles, Mr. Jones.
[01:24:00.782 --> 01:24:05.945]  What type of man with a woman in desperate need of help could demand to see her breast?
[01:24:06.325 --> 01:24:07.826]  This is who our government's hired.
[01:24:08.026 --> 01:24:13.610]  They have hired an army of scum and goons, and they've almost kicked all the good people out of government.
[01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:14.810]  It's called tyranny.
[01:24:15.811 --> 01:24:16.751]  So you witnessed that.
[01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.252]  Tell folks what you witnessed.
[01:24:18.712 --> 01:24:21.074]  Who did you see making women show their breasts for water?
[01:24:22.426 --> 01:24:23.567]  Uh, there's a national guard.
[01:24:24.088 --> 01:24:25.249]  Yep, there's America.
[01:24:25.409 --> 01:24:26.631]  Well, it was almost policemen.
[01:24:26.851 --> 01:24:28.112]  It was, uh, camouflaged.
[01:24:28.152 --> 01:24:28.713]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:29.414 --> 01:24:30.495]  Some of them had signatures.
[01:24:30.635 --> 01:24:34.299]  Well, we have all the video of the cops robbing pawn shops and Wal-Mart for goods.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.142]  Well, down on Canal Street, yes, we've seen that too.
[01:24:37.183 --> 01:24:38.484]  Who watches the government?
[01:24:38.744 --> 01:24:41.848]  You give the government the power of God, you get tyranny.
[01:24:43.095 --> 01:24:46.117]  And look, they were dressing old women and they really got off on it.
[01:24:46.437 --> 01:24:49.439]  And most of the men stayed inside and sent their wife for the water.
[01:24:49.739 --> 01:24:50.740]  That's what got me.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:51.601]  I'm disgusted.
[01:25:13.556 --> 01:25:14.737]  Worship being weak.
[01:25:15.137 --> 01:25:16.379]  I hear them on the radio.
[01:25:16.619 --> 01:25:17.380]  They love it!
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.522]  They are... This country's going down.
[01:25:19.762 --> 01:25:21.204]  You just better know that right now.
[01:25:21.544 --> 01:25:28.431]  All I'm trying to do is save as much as we can, warn as many people as we can, Charles, but the average American male wants to be a slave.
[01:25:28.492 --> 01:25:29.332]  They enjoy it.
[01:25:30.153 --> 01:25:30.874]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:25:32.135 --> 01:25:33.697]  The man wants to see the man.
[01:25:33.997 --> 01:25:37.220]  Men want to see men run with the ball, Mr. Jones.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.601]  Our country's going down.
[01:25:38.621 --> 01:25:39.942]  These kids can't read and write.
[01:25:40.183 --> 01:25:44.907]  He ain't got no money, but he wants to see the man run with the ball.
[01:25:46.152 --> 01:25:46.652]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:46.832 --> 01:25:48.053]  They want to see the ball.
[01:25:48.093 --> 01:25:50.913]  They want to see the football, because that's manly.
[01:25:51.053 --> 01:25:52.434]  Coke McCoy!
[01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:54.854]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:25:54.914 --> 01:25:56.635]  Thank God for what you've done, my friend.
[01:25:57.575 --> 01:25:59.836]  You've been right all along for 13 years.
[01:26:00.156 --> 01:26:02.096]  No one could prove you wrong I ever met.
[01:26:02.356 --> 01:26:03.577]  And I thank God for you.
[01:26:03.797 --> 01:26:05.577]  I don't care what people think I'm blowing smoke.
[01:26:05.917 --> 01:26:07.578]  Thank God for you standing up.
[01:26:07.598 --> 01:26:08.958]  At least you are a man.
[01:26:09.318 --> 01:26:10.399]  Nobody can laugh at you.
[01:26:10.739 --> 01:26:11.799]  The rest of them wouldn't do it.
[01:26:12.259 --> 01:26:15.021]  Well, Charles, I love you, and I appreciate all the great work you've done.
[01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:15.521]  God bless.
[01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:17.563]  Charles has sent us so much good intel over the years.
[01:26:17.983 --> 01:26:19.064]  Donna in New Hampshire.
[01:26:19.084 --> 01:26:19.744]  Go ahead, Donna.
[01:26:20.885 --> 01:26:21.285]  Hi.
[01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:22.666]  I agree with him.
[01:26:22.766 --> 01:26:26.589]  I'm an 11-year listener, and I totally agree, Alex.
[01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:29.151]  You've been, you know, spearheading the whole movement.
[01:26:30.192 --> 01:26:32.033]  I see two things happening here.
[01:26:32.193 --> 01:26:40.559]  I see that they want us to stop moving about freely, and I also see that their main goal is to start implementing biometrics.
[01:26:41.656 --> 01:26:52.370]  And what did I say a year ago, only because I had the documents, they're saving the biometric scans for biometrics and now Market Watch last week, they are biometrically scanning.
[01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:53.471]  I absolutely agree.
[01:26:53.771 --> 01:26:57.516]  But they don't want us protesting all at once and bringing it to a head.
[01:26:57.817 --> 01:27:00.180]  They want to slowly shut down commerce and travel.
[01:27:01.417 --> 01:27:17.499]  Well that's why I'm a little upset with Jesse Ventura because the way I look at it is we need leaderless resistance right now and we need everybody to not stop flying but to stand up and say we're not going to take this anymore and no you're not going to fondle me and no you're not going to molest me.
[01:27:17.619 --> 01:27:18.099]  Sure, sure.
[01:27:18.119 --> 01:27:20.360]  It's just that imagine him flying four or five times a week.
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:21.881]  I've flown with him multiple times.
[01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:23.362]  And you're watching him.
[01:27:23.862 --> 01:27:25.403]  And here's the former governor of Minnesota.
[01:27:25.423 --> 01:27:26.343]  They all know who he is.
[01:27:26.403 --> 01:27:28.004]  The TSA is taking photos of him.
[01:27:28.384 --> 01:27:31.626]  And they're running their hands all the way up his legs, in his groin area.
[01:27:32.326 --> 01:27:33.467]  You heard him Friday.
[01:27:34.107 --> 01:27:37.469]  They actually touched his hind end in the crack.
[01:27:37.909 --> 01:27:40.590]  And he's standing there going, it's East Germany, Alex.
[01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:42.411]  I'm going to leave this country, Alex.
[01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:45.913]  And you've got some goon doing this.
[01:27:46.854 --> 01:27:49.139]  And notice, just a year ago, it was wanding.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.187]  It's always more, more, more, more, more, more.
[01:27:52.427 --> 01:27:54.152]  Get your stinking hands off me!
[01:27:54.453 --> 01:27:55.114]  It's training us.
[01:27:55.154 --> 01:27:55.856]  We're prisoners!
[01:27:57.529 --> 01:27:58.630]  I absolutely agree.
[01:27:58.710 --> 01:28:00.372]  My husband flies every two weeks.
[01:28:00.472 --> 01:28:02.615]  I understand exactly what Jesse's saying.
[01:28:03.095 --> 01:28:10.964]  And, you know, you had Russell Means on a few weeks ago, and he said, and I quote, Americans are proof that history is repeating itself.
[01:28:11.525 --> 01:28:13.347]  And no truer words have been said.
[01:28:13.527 --> 01:28:17.231]  Well, I mean, he went on to say we're one giant Indian reservation.
[01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:24.976]  Listen, Hitler wrote that he used the Indian Reservation model for his camps.
[01:28:25.877 --> 01:28:29.939]  The British used that model that they developed here before the U.S.
[01:28:29.979 --> 01:28:31.340]  got set up.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:36.103]  We're all being trained to be slaves and to have minimum wage goons ruling over us.
[01:28:36.363 --> 01:28:38.605]  Powerless, empty people that want the power.
[01:28:38.985 --> 01:28:40.006]  Donna, anything else?
[01:28:41.147 --> 01:28:45.569]  Nope, just none are so hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe they're free.
[01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:47.270]  Yep, the Bible's got it right.
[01:28:47.290 --> 01:28:53.032]  We'll be right back after this break with Don, Tom, Ronnie, Jim, Ben, Mike, Ruthie, Brad and others.
[01:28:53.112 --> 01:28:55.093]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[01:31:55.278 --> 01:31:56.158]  Others don't.
[01:31:57.315 --> 01:32:01.558]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:01.858 --> 01:32:02.138]  Number 1.
[01:32:02.779 --> 01:32:05.921]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:06.201 --> 01:32:06.761]  Number 2.
[01:32:07.062 --> 01:32:11.625]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:11.965 --> 01:32:12.405]  It's true.
[01:32:12.705 --> 01:32:17.268]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:17.569 --> 01:32:18.109]  Number 3.
[01:32:18.409 --> 01:32:21.691]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:21.991 --> 01:32:25.694]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:25.894 --> 01:32:26.435]  Number 4.
[01:32:26.675 --> 01:32:29.037]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:29.437 --> 01:32:32.820]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:33.341]  Number 5.
[01:32:33.921 --> 01:32:37.824]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:38.065 --> 01:32:42.829]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:47.132]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:47.272 --> 01:32:48.853]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.073 --> 01:32:51.154]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:51.315 --> 01:32:53.916]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:53.936 --> 01:32:59.680]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:00.681 --> 01:33:02.102]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:02.722 --> 01:33:05.944]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:14.491 --> 01:33:20.077]  Nobody else in the world pats people's genitals at checkpoints or sticks their hand down their pants.
[01:33:20.617 --> 01:33:22.159]  But we do here, because we're free!
[01:33:22.219 --> 01:33:23.100]  We're America!
[01:33:24.801 --> 01:33:34.231]  Nobody else in the world has private bankers sit up in front of Congress and say, or their legislature, their parliaments, and say, we won't tell you where trillions of dollars went that we took.
[01:33:35.832 --> 01:33:38.475]  But see, we think we're free here, so we put up with anything.
[01:33:41.246 --> 01:33:46.987]  Now, the good news is, for everybody, the sleeping giant that is free humanity is waking up.
[01:33:47.707 --> 01:33:50.188]  But this country is going into a depression.
[01:33:50.228 --> 01:33:51.808]  We have been financially set up.
[01:33:52.388 --> 01:33:53.849]  World government is being announced.
[01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:56.889]  And if we don't say no to this, the globalists are going to win.
[01:33:58.850 --> 01:34:01.710]  But the good news is, people are starting to show fight.
[01:34:02.231 --> 01:34:05.171]  And the system has begun to pay attention to it.
[01:34:06.311 --> 01:34:08.072]  Let's go ahead and go to Don in Michigan.
[01:34:08.112 --> 01:34:08.812]  Don, you're on the air.
[01:34:10.267 --> 01:34:11.047]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:34:11.167 --> 01:34:11.428]  Good.
[01:34:12.468 --> 01:34:26.355]  Okay, I micro-rattled through a bunch of stuff, and absolutely, PresidentPlanet.tv member, and passed out, I think, like 600 DVDs, and proud to do that, and happy to do that.
[01:34:26.716 --> 01:34:27.756]  You're awesome.
[01:34:28.417 --> 01:34:29.877]  I would like to thank the tyrants.
[01:34:31.601 --> 01:34:41.006]  For giving us the TSA, because that's opened so many people's eyes and let people know that, oh my God, you know, really, what can they do?
[01:34:41.667 --> 01:34:43.048]  And why are they doing it?
[01:34:44.288 --> 01:34:50.872]  As far as Glenn Beck, I like to watch him to pick the pepper out of the fly crap.
[01:34:53.093 --> 01:34:59.237]  You know, he's on his way, but Glenn, if you're listening, my God, you know, be real.
[01:35:00.503 --> 01:35:23.495]  uh... become real and and if you if you want to say this i want to say this i mean i told back months ago cover poison in the water supply cover eugenics he has been last week he was talking about rockefeller not just soros being part of the new world order so he's moving in the right direction and uh... so i would look for him to be destroyed uh... or they'll attempt to destroy him uh... very very soon
[01:35:24.275 --> 01:35:27.678]  And a little bird told me something like that might be coming down the pike in December.
[01:35:28.058 --> 01:35:30.900]  So he better brace for impact, but I'm going to shut my mouth now.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.341]  Don, I got a bunch of callers.
[01:35:32.401 --> 01:35:32.921]  Please continue.
[01:35:32.941 --> 01:35:33.682]  What else is on your mind?
[01:35:34.643 --> 01:35:42.068]  Oh, no, just like you just said, the poisoning, the sodium fluoride, the BPA and TSA.
[01:35:42.508 --> 01:35:43.649]  You know, come on, Glenn.
[01:35:43.769 --> 01:35:45.971]  If you want to get on board, address this.
[01:35:46.331 --> 01:35:46.631]  Do it.
[01:35:46.852 --> 01:35:47.312]  Go with it.
[01:35:48.082 --> 01:35:48.943]  Don't stop now.
[01:35:49.423 --> 01:35:57.650]  I got a sister flying out of Pittsburgh today, and I wanted to hear her story before I called your show, because I wanted to hear what she went through.
[01:35:58.050 --> 01:35:59.371]  And she was oblivious.
[01:35:59.812 --> 01:36:01.373]  She's the smartest person I know.
[01:36:01.473 --> 01:36:16.005]  She's into college, into education, but when I asked her, I said, well, are you going to go with the radiation or are you going to go with the molestation?
[01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:17.591]  She had no idea.
[01:36:17.611 --> 01:36:19.654]  She had no idea what I was talking about.
[01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:27.202]  They're saving the biometric scan, so that for me is the big issue.
[01:36:27.222 --> 01:36:28.083]  So what did she say, Don?
[01:36:29.481 --> 01:36:30.002]  I didn't.
[01:36:30.202 --> 01:36:31.103]  I haven't heard from her.
[01:36:31.123 --> 01:36:32.944]  She's just now getting home tonight.
[01:36:33.405 --> 01:36:35.387]  And I'm looking forward to hearing what she had to say.
[01:36:35.787 --> 01:36:43.714]  And, you know, in a rude way, I'm hoping that she let them pat her down, because I think that would be the biggest thing to wake her up.
[01:36:43.934 --> 01:36:44.655]  I hear you, Don.
[01:36:45.055 --> 01:36:45.896]  Don, great points.
[01:36:46.396 --> 01:36:48.258]  Again, though, they know how to dog train us.
[01:36:48.979 --> 01:36:50.140]  They do this incrementally.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.022]  Not all the airports have the naked body scanners.
[01:36:53.783 --> 01:37:02.107]  Not all the airports are doing the pat-downs, but they admit all of them will be doing it, and everyone will get a pat-down on top of the scanner.
[01:37:03.968 --> 01:37:06.169]  You didn't understand that, and that's what I was trying to tell her.
[01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:12.713]  And I didn't want to scare her, I didn't want to freak her out, but I knew, you know, she said, well, I'm hoping I get neither.
[01:37:13.293 --> 01:37:14.994]  And I'm like, well, you're getting one or the other.
[01:37:15.014 --> 01:37:19.456]  You know, if you don't, if you don't submit... Absolutely, Don, I appreciate your call.
[01:37:19.516 --> 01:37:20.997]  Tom in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:37:22.796 --> 01:37:24.897]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:37:25.297 --> 01:37:49.091]  The big point that I wanted to make today is not to call people to violence, but to say that the only real way that we're going to stop these thugs from having their way with us is what the people in the ghettos in Germany and in Soviet Russia should have done when they knew that the secret police were making their visits.
[01:37:49.491 --> 01:37:50.131]  Well, I know this.
[01:37:50.271 --> 01:37:58.854]  I was looking at photos and videos of men, women, and children marching into pits and being shot in the head, and they are two feet from German soldiers.
[01:37:59.694 --> 01:38:01.374]  I would be grabbing those machine guns.
[01:38:01.495 --> 01:38:02.295]  I'd be fighting.
[01:38:02.895 --> 01:38:04.956]  I mean, look, I am not going.
[01:38:05.276 --> 01:38:08.256]  And of course, it may not be being marched into pits to be shot in the head.
[01:38:08.577 --> 01:38:13.138]  It'll be the government raising your taxes, taking your bank account, feeding on you.
[01:38:14.158 --> 01:38:15.079]  Again, I'm done.
[01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:18.880]  We've got to start saying no, not just on the TSA, but on all of it.
[01:38:19.121 --> 01:38:20.181]  Government's too big.
[01:38:20.441 --> 01:38:21.362]  It's out of control.
[01:38:21.642 --> 01:38:22.782]  This ain't America!
[01:38:23.242 --> 01:38:29.745]  And people better grow up and read what Thomas Jefferson said and decide whether they like tyranny or liberty.
[01:38:30.446 --> 01:38:34.187]  You know, so many yuppies send me emails and say, I don't care if they spy on me.
[01:38:34.467 --> 01:38:35.548]  What about the government?
[01:38:35.588 --> 01:38:36.588]  Who watches them?
[01:38:36.949 --> 01:38:37.649]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:38:39.352 --> 01:38:45.976]  Well, what I also wanted to say is perhaps what we should start out with is maybe a little slap on the hand when they get a little too close.
[01:38:46.096 --> 01:38:51.699]  Or when you say, you're not going to touch me, and they go to touch you, just give them a little slap on the hand and say no.
[01:38:52.019 --> 01:38:53.720]  Treat them like they're children.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.042]  They will take you in the back room and break your neck.
[01:38:56.542 --> 01:38:57.943]  They kill people all the time.
[01:38:58.223 --> 01:39:00.605]  People get killed all the time in airports and back rooms.
[01:39:00.645 --> 01:39:02.086]  They claim you fall down and hit your head.
[01:39:02.687 --> 01:39:04.648]  The problem is, you're scum, you're trash.
[01:39:04.909 --> 01:39:06.250]  They're looking for an excuse.
[01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:08.531]  They don't want to just stick their hands down your pants.
[01:39:08.552 --> 01:39:09.893]  They want to billy club you to death.
[01:39:10.573 --> 01:39:14.656]  And I guarantee you, sir, they're grabbing catheters out of men and women.
[01:39:14.696 --> 01:39:16.157]  They're grabbing colostomy bags.
[01:39:16.438 --> 01:39:18.780]  They're taking sutures off of surgery patients.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.362]  And if somebody just shoves them, they're charging them.
[01:39:21.702 --> 01:39:22.502]  They're God.
[01:39:22.863 --> 01:39:23.643]  You're scum.
[01:39:23.964 --> 01:39:24.884]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:25.925 --> 01:39:27.165]  I don't know if I want to advise that.
[01:39:27.485 --> 01:39:33.066]  No, you let them abuse you, and then you sue them, and you go to the DA, and you file charges for sexual assault.
[01:39:33.566 --> 01:39:34.807]  That's what you do to the scum.
[01:39:35.167 --> 01:39:36.347]  I appreciate your call, Tom.
[01:39:36.747 --> 01:39:37.747]  But they want to murder you.
[01:39:37.847 --> 01:39:40.028]  I mean, they like power, so I wouldn't do that.
[01:39:40.328 --> 01:39:42.368]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Texas.
[01:39:42.788 --> 01:39:43.708]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:39:43.788 --> 01:39:44.128]  Welcome.
[01:39:46.109 --> 01:39:46.689]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:47.229]  How are you doing?
[01:39:47.389 --> 01:39:47.669]  Good.
[01:39:47.909 --> 01:39:53.230]  I was listening earlier, and you were talking about them bringing up the false flag.
[01:39:56.064 --> 01:40:04.309]  False flag events again in order to usher in and justify... Oh yeah, you better believe they're going to blow stuff up and pose as our mommy and our daddy and tell us how great they are.
[01:40:04.329 --> 01:40:05.170]  Yeah, they're a bunch of criminals.
[01:40:05.190 --> 01:40:05.530]  Go ahead.
[01:40:07.111 --> 01:40:13.515]  Well, I called in here a couple of weeks ago and I'm the one that was talking about having a planned response in place.
[01:40:14.156 --> 01:40:18.218]  You know, get people to fire these, you know, we've got to fire them somehow.
[01:40:18.238 --> 01:40:19.419]  We've got to get them out of where they're at.
[01:40:20.283 --> 01:40:23.810]  The impeachment of officials that are allowing this to take place.
[01:40:25.112 --> 01:40:25.633]  That's right.
[01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:30.962]  Let the feds stage their terror attack, but then day one we create a huge grassroots movement.
[01:40:31.263 --> 01:40:32.445]  Why aren't you fired?
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:36.743]  You know, groping two-year-olds wasn't enough for you and that couldn't keep us safe?
[01:40:37.163 --> 01:40:39.304]  Don't get promoted and pose as our savior.
[01:40:40.005 --> 01:40:40.926]  Be fired!
[01:40:41.366 --> 01:40:43.748]  Fired for letting the terrorist, i.e.
[01:40:43.788 --> 01:40:45.469]  the government, stage the event.
[01:40:45.489 --> 01:40:47.070]  So at least fire the terrorist.
[01:40:48.892 --> 01:40:49.372]  Absolutely.
[01:40:49.412 --> 01:40:50.152]  Great point, Jim.
[01:40:51.874 --> 01:40:58.679]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the Supreme Court come out at some point in time and say that the police were not obligated to protect you?
[01:40:59.488 --> 01:41:01.410]  Yes, because they can't protect you.
[01:41:01.730 --> 01:41:09.456]  They are there to respond once a crime has been committed, to bring you to justice, to the people's court, empowered by the state legislature.
[01:41:09.996 --> 01:41:14.560]  And so they're there to bring you into jail, so that justice can be done by the people's court.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:16.962]  We're the jurors and grand jurors.
[01:41:17.603 --> 01:41:26.530]  And now they need to try to fight crime, and that's one of their main missions, but it's not their responsibility, because the cops, the average 911 calls 12 minutes.
[01:41:28.211 --> 01:41:30.393]  You know, and the cops can't protect you.
[01:41:31.153 --> 01:41:33.115]  Look, the world isn't perfect.
[01:41:33.595 --> 01:41:36.037]  There's hundreds of thousands of car accident deaths.
[01:41:37.238 --> 01:41:40.220]  Hundreds of thousands of bad drug interactions with legal drugs.
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:43.062]  Honey bees kill hundreds a year.
[01:41:43.983 --> 01:41:46.505]  You can't ban honey bees because they're killing people.
[01:41:46.785 --> 01:41:48.226]  And you can't ban terrorists.
[01:41:48.526 --> 01:41:49.627]  Let's just grow up!
[01:41:50.327 --> 01:41:51.648]  Good points, Jim.
[01:41:52.289 --> 01:41:53.650]  Let's talk to Ben in Indiana.
[01:41:53.690 --> 01:41:54.471]  Ben, you're on the air.
[01:41:54.511 --> 01:41:54.831]  Welcome.
[01:41:57.671 --> 01:41:58.491]  Come on, come on, Ben!
[01:41:58.511 --> 01:41:59.052]  Can you hear me Alex?
[01:41:59.092 --> 01:41:59.532]  Yes, I can.
[01:41:59.552 --> 01:42:01.753]  Go ahead.
[01:42:02.894 --> 01:42:05.315]  I'm a huge InfoWars supporter, Prison Planet TV member.
[01:42:05.335 --> 01:42:08.476]  I just want to say great job in waking people up to the TSA and the body scanners.
[01:42:08.516 --> 01:42:11.798]  I've got some info that only you and InfoWars can cover.
[01:42:12.318 --> 01:42:12.598]  Okay.
[01:42:13.219 --> 01:42:18.261]  The article is, Around the World, a Race Against Time Bombs in Air.
[01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:19.182]  It's out of the AP.
[01:42:20.282 --> 01:42:25.145]  And about middle way down through the section labeled Tracking, it says that the FBI
[01:42:26.317 --> 01:42:36.768]  Called FedEx and UPS, which had participated in a government terrorism drill in August, the exercise, a homemade bomb, slipped onto a cargo plane.
[01:42:37.782 --> 01:42:39.184]  No, they always run drills.
[01:42:39.244 --> 01:42:42.308]  It's like this German bomb turned out to be the U.S.
[01:42:42.328 --> 01:42:46.973]  government last week, but because the Germans confirmed it wasn't real, Obama couldn't grandstand.
[01:42:47.454 --> 01:42:48.936]  But I didn't know they were running a drill.
[01:42:49.316 --> 01:42:50.578]  Oh, this is huge.
[01:42:50.938 --> 01:42:51.359]  Stay there.
[01:42:51.619 --> 01:42:52.801]  They always run a drill.
[01:42:53.161 --> 01:42:55.284]  Well, that's incredible.
[01:42:55.524 --> 01:42:56.085]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:59.073 --> 01:43:13.540]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:43:14.541 --> 01:43:18.223]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:43:19.232 --> 01:43:31.244]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:43:32.004 --> 01:43:39.271]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:43:39.952 --> 01:43:49.558]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:43:50.319 --> 01:43:53.601]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:43:54.262 --> 01:43:57.364]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:43:58.052 --> 01:44:02.015]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:44:02.255 --> 01:44:08.300]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:15.766]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:44:16.046 --> 01:44:20.650]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:44:29.578 --> 01:44:33.303]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:44:33.843 --> 01:44:40.027]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:44.049]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:44:44.489 --> 01:44:45.650]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091.

[01:44:52.273 --> 01:44:52.774]  Thank you.
[01:44:52.874 --> 01:44:55.835]  You may be arrested and or subject to
[01:45:01.969 --> 01:45:02.890]  Tyranny is here.
[01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:06.873]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:45:07.153 --> 01:45:09.395]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:45:09.575 --> 01:45:14.839]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:45:15.259 --> 01:45:21.524]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:45:21.924 --> 01:45:27.489]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:45:27.929 --> 01:45:31.612]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:45:32.072 --> 01:45:36.074]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:45:36.354 --> 01:45:41.877]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:45:42.318 --> 01:45:45.279]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:45:45.859 --> 01:45:47.300]  The police state isn't coming.

[01:46:45.033 --> 01:46:49.734]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:46:49.994 --> 01:46:50.734]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:46:51.314 --> 01:46:55.975]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:46:59.136 --> 01:47:00.276]  Coast to Coast.
[01:47:00.676 --> 01:47:01.916]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:05.917]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:11.687 --> 01:47:12.387]  Big Brother.
[01:47:12.668 --> 01:47:13.948]  Mainstream media.
[01:47:14.349 --> 01:47:15.489]  Government cover-ups.
[01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:16.710]  You want answers?
[01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:18.071]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:19.072 --> 01:47:23.595]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:31.144]  All these TV shows about terrorism, all these drills in towns all over the place.
[01:47:31.904 --> 01:47:35.106]  It's meant to create the perception that terror is everywhere.
[01:47:35.787 --> 01:47:40.730]  Small towns getting $300,000 robots to disarm bombs.
[01:47:42.191 --> 01:47:44.333]  A McDonald's bag on the side of the street.
[01:47:44.393 --> 01:47:45.634]  The SWAT team comes out.
[01:47:45.674 --> 01:47:47.175]  Everybody's afraid.
[01:47:48.296 --> 01:47:51.378]  It's about government posing as our saviors.
[01:47:51.478 --> 01:47:52.399]  They're the heroes.
[01:47:53.578 --> 01:47:57.022]  How many times have they caught firefighters burning down buildings to be heroes?
[01:47:57.563 --> 01:47:59.906]  How many times have they caught cops planting pipe bombs?
[01:48:00.847 --> 01:48:01.288]  A lot.
[01:48:01.989 --> 01:48:03.290]  It's basic criminology.
[01:48:04.031 --> 01:48:06.795]  And the caller... Who are we talking to?
[01:48:06.835 --> 01:48:07.335]  What's his name?
[01:48:08.437 --> 01:48:08.557]  Who?
[01:48:09.994 --> 01:48:13.498]  Ben in Indiana brought up this MSNBC story.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:18.143]  Around the world, a race against time bombs in the air.
[01:48:18.824 --> 01:48:22.048]  Details emerge of a plot to blow up cargo planes inside the US.
[01:48:22.509 --> 01:48:23.890]  This is back from early November.
[01:48:26.273 --> 01:48:28.075]  And sure enough, it says,
[01:48:29.353 --> 01:48:36.901]  Uh, that the FBI had called FedEx UPS, which had participated in a government terror drill in August.
[01:48:37.321 --> 01:48:41.245]  The exercise, a homemade bomb, slipped onto a cargo plane.
[01:48:41.766 --> 01:48:45.129]  Now the British then tested it and said it was a dud.
[01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:46.110]  It wasn't a real bomb.
[01:48:46.631 --> 01:48:48.993]  Obama still gave a speech and said, no, it was real.
[01:48:49.533 --> 01:48:51.515]  The British came out and said, okay, we checked again.
[01:48:51.555 --> 01:48:52.817]  It is now.
[01:48:53.993 --> 01:48:56.957]  What's in AP in the Daily Mail today?
[01:48:57.538 --> 01:49:00.863]  Fake bomb aboard German passenger jet was made by U.S.
[01:49:00.903 --> 01:49:03.187]  security firm Airport Security.
[01:49:05.842 --> 01:49:08.945]  So, again, these are drills, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:09.365 --> 01:49:12.968]  And we ought to be glad that they're not actually blowing up real planes, just doing duds.
[01:49:13.649 --> 01:49:16.551]  But see, if a real plane blows up, then there has to be an investigation.
[01:49:16.912 --> 01:49:18.333]  Finishing up with Ben in Indiana.
[01:49:18.853 --> 01:49:20.895]  Very interesting tidbit, Ben.
[01:49:21.195 --> 01:49:23.657]  So we had a drill going on right when all this went on.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:26.520]  Exactly.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.461]  Same as on 9-11.
[01:49:30.589 --> 01:49:30.849]  7-7.
[01:49:30.909 --> 01:49:32.770]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:37.874]  Every time we have a terrorist attack, it seems like there's drills at Fort Hood.
[01:49:38.174 --> 01:49:46.460]  It's on record that the federal government helped get the underwear bomber on the plane, and he was commanded by a Lockheed who's admittedly works for the Pentagon.
[01:49:48.221 --> 01:49:48.741]  Absolutely.
[01:49:48.821 --> 01:49:50.562]  I mean, they think we're so stupid, Ben.
[01:49:52.984 --> 01:49:56.246]  I think people are waking up with your help.
[01:49:56.266 --> 01:49:59.548]  You know, I learned how to scan news, and now I can see this stuff.
[01:50:01.064 --> 01:50:02.485]  Help to contribute to the InfoWarp.
[01:50:02.705 --> 01:50:03.526]  Well, Ben, you're awesome.
[01:50:03.566 --> 01:50:04.346]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:04.366 --> 01:50:06.507]  We'll get the writers and researchers on this right now.
[01:50:06.527 --> 01:50:13.711]  Just one more piece of evidence confirming the same paradigm, the same footprint, the same fingerprints, the same M.O.
[01:50:14.212 --> 01:50:15.573]  It's always the same signature.
[01:50:15.593 --> 01:50:18.834]  I want to be clear.
[01:50:18.915 --> 01:50:24.298]  The reason this radio show is now in many cases able to set the news agenda
[01:50:25.046 --> 01:50:27.027]  And that's not Alex Jones tootin' his horn.
[01:50:27.427 --> 01:50:29.107]  There's a lot of news articles right now.
[01:50:29.127 --> 01:50:30.748]  You can just type Alex Jones into Google.
[01:50:31.188 --> 01:50:35.229]  Mainstream news pointing out, we pushed this TSA thing over the edge.
[01:50:36.529 --> 01:50:37.710]  With the help of the Drudge Report.
[01:50:40.011 --> 01:50:42.411]  We're able to do this because of you, the activist listeners.
[01:50:42.651 --> 01:50:44.552]  Mike in Maryland, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:50:46.761 --> 01:50:47.521]  Hey, am I on the air now?
[01:50:47.681 --> 01:50:48.222]  Yes, you are.
[01:50:48.522 --> 01:50:49.382]  Hey, thanks.
[01:50:49.402 --> 01:50:50.223]  I didn't hear the little noise.
[01:50:50.523 --> 01:50:52.144]  It's a pleasure and an honor to talk to you.
[01:50:52.184 --> 01:50:55.305]  I'm at the DC911truth.org and... Honor to have you, Mike.
[01:50:55.345 --> 01:50:55.985]  What's on your mind?
[01:50:56.406 --> 01:50:56.906]  Hey, listen.
[01:50:57.166 --> 01:50:59.347]  Before I talk about the... Can I say anything?
[01:50:59.887 --> 01:51:01.288]  May I be so bold to make a request?
[01:51:01.946 --> 01:51:12.189]  There's this one woman journalist, Deborah Dupree, from www.examiner.com, and I read her news stories on the internet, and it's almost like going to your website.
[01:51:12.509 --> 01:51:16.191]  She's got ads, and the stories about Camp FEMA, and other things.
[01:51:16.371 --> 01:51:17.391]  She would make a great guest.
[01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:19.253]  There's millions of great guests.
[01:51:19.273 --> 01:51:25.098]  You know, Geraldo Rivera last week came out and said that the towers could have been blown up, including 7.
[01:51:25.318 --> 01:51:32.606]  And then he got questioned on another Fox show about it, and he said, yeah, there's evidence they blew up Building 7.
[01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:33.967]  It should be investigated.
[01:51:34.527 --> 01:51:36.629]  So incredible things happening right now.
[01:51:37.610 --> 01:51:38.411]  Anything else, Mike?
[01:51:38.832 --> 01:51:40.934]  Well, you basically, you know, I'm...
[01:51:41.534 --> 01:51:45.936]  Maybe not the activist I should be, but I try my best to help out whenever I can.
[01:51:46.256 --> 01:51:47.736]  We've all got to fight the terrorists.
[01:51:47.776 --> 01:51:49.957]  We've all got to come together against the corporate terrorists.
[01:51:50.397 --> 01:51:55.259]  Let me just say that a number of years ago I used to dabble in art and I came across this one book.
[01:51:55.299 --> 01:52:02.041]  It had this interesting Jewish fellow with this long beard and I copied, I sketched his picture.
[01:52:02.461 --> 01:52:02.662]  I think?
[01:52:15.988 --> 01:52:16.508]  Exactly.
[01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:18.350]  First it was, may I see your papers?
[01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:20.331]  Then it was, I'm going to search your pants.
[01:52:20.651 --> 01:52:23.493]  We found photos of the Germans sticking their hands in their pants.
[01:52:24.053 --> 01:52:25.194]  This is how this happens.
[01:52:25.234 --> 01:52:25.734]  Great point.
[01:52:25.775 --> 01:52:26.235]  Anything else?
[01:52:26.855 --> 01:52:36.301]  No, I just say we have to stand up to tyranny and evil and confront it whenever we face it because we can't back down.
[01:52:36.341 --> 01:52:37.902]  Yes, tyranny is growing.
[01:52:37.963 --> 01:52:39.263]  Look at it on every front.
[01:52:39.363 --> 01:52:41.505]  Wake up, folks who are new listeners.
[01:52:42.085 --> 01:52:43.566]  Let's talk to Ruthie in Florida.
[01:52:43.626 --> 01:52:44.427]  Ruthie, you're on the air.
[01:52:46.119 --> 01:52:49.241]  Hi, I talked to you about a little over a year ago.
[01:52:49.261 --> 01:52:51.161]  I just got two things.
[01:52:51.241 --> 01:52:57.164]  First, I'm thinking they're making things so ugly at the airport because the next step for them will be government approved travel.
[01:52:57.204 --> 01:52:58.865]  You'll have to have papers sponsored.
[01:52:59.366 --> 01:53:04.108]  You know, the government will check you out and say, yeah, it's okay if you travel and you can't go anywhere.
[01:53:04.148 --> 01:53:04.488]  No, no, no!
[01:53:04.668 --> 01:53:10.891]  They admit you're going to go through a background check and then have your ID card where they approve you to fly.
[01:53:10.911 --> 01:53:13.532]  Well, that's called your driver's license.
[01:53:13.552 --> 01:53:18.274]  You know, people were against the driver's license saying it would turn into this, and now it has.
[01:53:18.334 --> 01:53:26.057]  But again, the borders are wide open, but then we've got to have hands stuck down our pants, and that is the next move, is the trusted traveler.
[01:53:26.357 --> 01:53:27.638]  They want to force you onto this.
[01:53:28.877 --> 01:53:32.641]  Yeah, you'll have to get pre-approval and put it all in your business and stuff.
[01:53:33.082 --> 01:53:36.525]  The second thing was, my front happens to be my donut shop.
[01:53:36.585 --> 01:53:38.868]  I don't know if you remember, I taught you a little over a year ago.
[01:53:39.769 --> 01:53:42.872]  And like the guy before, I keep doing my thing too.
[01:53:42.932 --> 01:53:45.495]  I post good stories that I see lots of them.
[01:53:45.535 --> 01:53:47.477]  Thank you very much on my Facebook.
[01:53:47.997 --> 01:53:49.479]  Hoping my friends are reading them.
[01:53:49.519 --> 01:53:50.240]  Some of them are.
[01:53:51.085 --> 01:53:59.967]  More and more in the donut shop every time I see an opportunity apparently I can't lie So when a subject subject comes up, and I know something about it, and thanks to you.
[01:54:00.007 --> 01:54:10.589]  I'm knowing a lot I'm able to say stuff about it and just the other day a young man came in and he People want to talk about this and he brought it up, and we had a nice conversation about it.
[01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:12.649]  Yes, people are now awoken!
[01:54:13.169 --> 01:54:14.969]  People are now ready to hear the truth.
[01:54:14.989 --> 01:54:17.470]  Such a change in the past year
[01:54:18.123 --> 01:54:21.367]  To where, you know, it was really scary to put it out there for a few people.
[01:54:21.407 --> 01:54:25.872]  But it's easy, like, sometimes they'll say, oh, I never do anything without my debit card.
[01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.654]  And I go, oh, I never use that anymore.
[01:54:27.714 --> 01:54:30.537]  I don't let the banks have any more of my money than they absolutely need.
[01:54:30.557 --> 01:54:33.040]  Well, Ruthie, Ruthie, Ruthie, you're awesome.
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:36.124]  We've got to jump to other callers and get everybody in, or at least some of the callers.
[01:54:36.524 --> 01:54:37.866]  But what did Mark Twain say?
[01:54:39.488 --> 01:54:43.109]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared.
[01:54:43.789 --> 01:54:50.271]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:54:50.832 --> 01:54:52.512]  We're learning how to say no.
[01:54:52.932 --> 01:54:54.233]  We're gaining momentum.
[01:54:55.553 --> 01:54:58.014]  The tyrants are illustrating how corrupt they are.
[01:54:58.514 --> 01:54:59.474]  Brad in Michigan.
[01:54:59.875 --> 01:55:00.435]  You're on the air.
[01:55:00.455 --> 01:55:00.855]  Go ahead.
[01:55:00.875 --> 01:55:02.375]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:02.435 --> 01:55:02.855]  Thank you.
[01:55:04.056 --> 01:55:06.597]  Short-time listener and been awakened thanks to you.
[01:55:07.952 --> 01:55:09.093]  I just want to say a couple things.
[01:55:09.633 --> 01:55:21.023]  First of all, to all the patriots out there, the people trying to spread the message, just ask yourself, where would we be if our forefathers stopped when people told them they were crazy?
[01:55:21.403 --> 01:55:24.545]  Or they stopped when people called them a nutjob or a conspiracy theorist?
[01:55:25.146 --> 01:55:29.289]  We would not be anywhere near the freedom that we somewhat have today.
[01:55:31.296 --> 01:55:34.278]  On the other hand, Alex, I wanted to ask you a couple, well, at least one question.
[01:55:34.358 --> 01:55:35.059]  Go ahead.
[01:55:35.299 --> 01:55:39.502]  I found a thing on a site called dailypaul.com.
[01:55:40.062 --> 01:55:42.184]  It is a Rand Paul website.
[01:55:43.265 --> 01:55:46.067]  It has an article in there talking about Bill S-510.
[01:55:46.227 --> 01:55:46.627]  Yes.
[01:55:47.528 --> 01:55:55.073]  And it says in there that there's $10 million supporting this bill and only like $2 million opposing it.
[01:55:56.594 --> 01:55:59.136]  So basically, from my understanding, what this is is big business.
[01:55:59.813 --> 01:56:01.454]  Being allowed to persuade the government?
[01:56:01.474 --> 01:56:06.859]  Yes, Big Mega Agra openly wants to shut down local farms and ranches, their competition.
[01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:12.204]  And so this bill will outlaw, if the government wants to, it gives them unlimited power.
[01:56:13.004 --> 01:56:20.010]  Look, it's kind of like this piece of legislation, and again it's not my words, this is Wired Magazine.
[01:56:20.976 --> 01:56:23.598]  Web censorship bill sails through Senate committee.
[01:56:24.098 --> 01:56:27.681]  It allows the government to just shut down anybody's site, no judge, no jury.
[01:56:28.522 --> 01:56:30.003]  Same thing with S-510.
[01:56:30.463 --> 01:56:40.951]  Doesn't let you make preserves grow, apples, nothing, and it's all written by big agribusiness to shut down their competition.
[01:56:41.732 --> 01:56:42.633]  One last caller.
[01:56:42.673 --> 01:56:43.533]  Kevin in Texas.
[01:56:43.553 --> 01:56:44.414]  You're our tail gunner.
[01:56:44.454 --> 01:56:44.854]  Go ahead.
[01:56:44.875 --> 01:56:46.996]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:56:47.176 --> 01:56:47.356]  Good.
[01:56:47.396 --> 01:56:47.977]  Got about a minute.
[01:56:49.128 --> 01:56:59.671]  Okay, I was just calling because it's the first time I've called in, and I heard about you from friends a while ago, and I have you as a friend on my like page for Facebook.
[01:56:59.871 --> 01:57:00.711]  Good to have you on board.
[01:57:00.751 --> 01:57:01.691]  What's on your mind, Kevin?
[01:57:03.112 --> 01:57:09.533]  I was wondering, why do you think the government's giving out free converter boxes for the community?
[01:57:10.513 --> 01:57:11.454]  Like digital TV.
[01:57:11.494 --> 01:57:12.294]  For television?
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:13.500]  Yeah.
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:27.044]  Because it's just a payoff to the corporation that manufactured them, and they want to phase out all local community TV, and it just sets the precedent for government to say what type of light bulb you've got, what type of toilet, you know, what type of car.
[01:57:27.385 --> 01:57:28.185]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:28.205 --> 01:57:28.785]  We're out of time.
[01:57:28.825 --> 01:57:30.886]  Rashid, Nick, others, I'm sorry.
[01:57:30.906 --> 01:57:32.926]  I'll be back tomorrow, live 11 a.m.
[01:57:32.966 --> 01:57:36.047]  Central, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:36.487 --> 01:57:39.629]  We'll continue to track the economy, everything else that's happening.
[01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:40.629]  Great job with the crew.
[01:57:41.269 --> 01:57:45.034]  Look, if we don't say no to the TSA now, what's coming next?
[01:57:45.114 --> 01:57:46.616]  Proctology exams?
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:53.125]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:57:53.486 --> 01:57:56.049]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
