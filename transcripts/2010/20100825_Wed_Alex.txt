[00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:09.691]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:11.293]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:12.835]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:17.041]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:21.086]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:29.169]  We have another important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.831]  It is Wednesday, the 25th day of August, 2010.
[00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:40.337]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we don't have any guests scheduled.
[00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:52.385]  I may have a few people popping in with some key info later in the broadcast, but no full guest interviews, 30-minute or hour-long interviews coming up today.
[00:00:54.107 --> 00:00:59.149]  Let me just give you a rundown of some of the amazing news that's coming up.
[00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:19.297]  In the weird stack, Hitler had Jewish and African roots, London Telegraph, DNA Test Show, by testing his known relatives here in the United States and Europe, taken from 39 relatives of the Nazi leader showing African and Jewish roots.
[00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:28.068]  It is a fact that his father, Adolf Hitler, was the illegitimate son of a servant girl in the Rothschild household.
[00:01:28.068 --> 00:01:29.309]  I've researched it.
[00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:31.671]  It's in mainline history.
[00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:37.695]  Also, of course, his third wife, Hitler's mother, was also his niece.
[00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:51.664]  And was reportedly also related because the wealthy and the royal of Europe constantly had illegitimate children and Hitler even had a lot of people killed to try to cover this up.
[00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:57.107]  This was a big scandal for Adolf Hitler, but now the DNA tests have come in.
[00:01:57.107 --> 00:02:06.132]  A lot of times I don't believe mainstream media and I don't really know what to make of this, but we do know that where there's smoke there's fire and that this is an interesting issue.
[00:02:06.852 --> 00:02:11.498]  So we'll be talking some about that today, but it's obviously not our top story.
[00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:19.308]  A report I meant to get to yesterday that I will cover during this hour is a very credible retired FBI agent.
[00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:28.207]  Who specifically discovered plans to kill Kennedy in the months before the operation has gone public.
[00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:40.612]  And now they've declassified, because we're 40 plus years later, the original FBI reports where they knew who some of the shooters were and what was being planned in Chicago and Dallas.
[00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:47.535]  He was meant to be killed a week before in Chicago, as other Secret Service agents and FBI agents have also gone public with.
[00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:55.296]  So this is a very credible FBI agent who worked the case before and after, including in Dallas.
[00:02:55.296 --> 00:03:00.737]  He wasn't from Dallas, he was sent to Dallas, and I'm going to work on getting him on the broadcast.
[00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:03.638]  I'm going to play a news clip of this and cover it.
[00:03:03.638 --> 00:03:08.439]  Paul Watson posted it yesterday at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.379]  The economic stack is absolutely frightening.
[00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.500]  We're going to be going over that as things deteriorate even faster.
[00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:34.095]  Last year I sent Rob Dew and Jason Douglas to Northern California, to Sacramento, the capital, where at night they basically lock up the homeless people and they don't let them sleep on the street or in tents or on city or state land.
[00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.976]  They basically arrest them.
[00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:39.678]  And the same thing is being rolled out in Hawaii.
[00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:49.103]  Well now, this is out of News 1, New York Republican candidate says prison dorms for welfare recipients.
[00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:52.384]  And this is also being proposed in England in the last few months.
[00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:58.168]  We've seen a lot of reports about, let's lock up the poor and let's make them work to pay for their room and board.
[00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:05.552]  And this is a very, very dangerous trend, so we'll be breaking that down today.
[00:04:05.552 --> 00:04:11.936]  Also, yesterday, I covered the fact that Carver's Bay enlists entire 9th grade.
[00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:15.158]  Welcome to high school, now drop and give me 20.
[00:04:15.158 --> 00:04:21.902]  They were forcibly put into the Junior ROTC, then they try to force them to sign commitment papers to join the military.
[00:04:22.998 --> 00:04:24.820]  This is going on all over the country.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.501]  But here's another one.
[00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:31.846]  Creeping Militarism Invades Alaska Grade High School by Kurt Nemo.
[00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:34.509]  But actually the link here is to the Alaska Star.
[00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.370]  Will you guys print me that link?
[00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.332]  I want to read from the Alaska Star itself.
[00:04:39.373 --> 00:04:43.334]  Uh, where the army is now training the kindergartners.
[00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:48.136]  This is part of full-spectrum dominance, complete takeover of our society.
[00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:58.780]  As the states and counties go bankrupt, the federal government and the army will run all of society with their top-secret USA million-man private spy team as well.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.420]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:05.662]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:05.662 --> 00:05:14.523]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:19.144]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:29.966]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:40.108]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:45.550]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:53.031]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:55.792]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:04.081]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.
[00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:11.572]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute into a concise, readily accessible form.
[00:06:11.572 --> 00:06:15.017]  By tracking 300 separately defined domestic and international trends,
[00:06:15.618 --> 00:06:20.140]  The Trends Journal establishes the connections that others fail to see or misinterpret.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:28.004]  Gerald Salente's Trends Journal allows you to anticipate change, recognize the implications, and take protective strategies.
[00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:32.707]  Individual readers from every walk of life can put the Trends Journal Trends Forecast
[00:06:33.007 --> 00:06:33.367]  I'm good.
[00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:03.892]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:03.892 --> 00:07:04.812]  Number 1.
[00:07:04.812 --> 00:07:08.235]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:09.095]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:13.978]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:13.978 --> 00:07:14.719]  It's true.
[00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:19.602]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.602 --> 00:07:20.422]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.422 --> 00:07:24.005]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:27.707]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:27.907 --> 00:07:28.707]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.707 --> 00:07:31.468]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.468 --> 00:07:35.148]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.148 --> 00:07:35.928]  Number 5.
[00:07:35.928 --> 00:07:40.089]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:45.130]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.311]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:51.091]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:55.692]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:07:56.032 --> 00:07:56.292]  877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:57.433]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:06.416]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:21.462 --> 00:08:27.025]  It is Wednesday, 25th day of August, 2010.
[00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:28.906]  Wide open phones today.
[00:08:28.906 --> 00:08:36.930]  On any of the news items I raise, any questions or comments or points you want to make, you are welcome to join us live on the air, worldwide.

[00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.702]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:51.702 --> 00:09:07.369]  Thank you for joining us, no matter how you're listening, whether it's watching us on YouTube or PrisonPlanet.tv or on the free iPhone app or the 300 plus thousand people a day that download the MP3 podcast that is free at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:07.369 --> 00:09:09.130]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.390]  Okay.
[00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:13.545]  Incredible new developments on military fronts.
[00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:19.089]  Wall Street Journal reports that the Pentagon is weighing a full-scale air war in Yemen.
[00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:22.832]  They're already moving into Pakistan, expanding the war in Afghanistan.
[00:09:22.832 --> 00:09:25.314]  They have renamed the combat brigades in Iraq.
[00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:26.955]  Combat is still going on.
[00:09:26.955 --> 00:09:30.718]  Pentagon says they'll be there until at least 2020, another decade.
[00:09:30.718 --> 00:09:34.301]  They're putting a private mercenary spy force, secret teams.
[00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:38.422]  Hit squads, snatch and grab torture squads.
[00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:43.024]  The same system being set up in Iraq is being set up in the United States.
[00:09:43.024 --> 00:09:48.386]  The exact same control grid and the Pentagon and MIT have even bragged about this.
[00:09:48.386 --> 00:10:01.231]  The face scanning cameras, the surveillance blimps, the license plate reading cameras, the retina scanning to buy and sell, the retina scanning and biometric scanning to get driver's license, the biometric scanning to
[00:10:02.091 --> 00:10:03.272]  Make purchases.
[00:10:03.272 --> 00:10:04.012]  It's all happening.
[00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:05.413]  We're going to be getting into that.
[00:10:05.413 --> 00:10:10.657]  Also on the economic front, Morgan Stanley says government defaults inevitable.
[00:10:10.657 --> 00:10:12.478]  Default on the debt.
[00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:13.019]  U.S.
[00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:16.822]  new home sales sunk to lowest pace on record.
[00:10:16.822 --> 00:10:17.962]  That's new home sales.
[00:10:17.962 --> 00:10:22.386]  Existing home sales as low as they've been since 1968.
[00:10:22.386 --> 00:10:26.548]  Durable goods orders rose far less than expected.
[00:10:26.548 --> 00:10:29.511]  Dow reclaims $10,000 after stocks plunged this morning.
[00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:34.775]  Again, Dow faces a bouncy ride to 5,000 says top strategist.
[00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:37.157]  Economy caught in depression, not recession.
[00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:38.758]  CNBC.
[00:10:38.758 --> 00:10:43.842]  Bancor, the name of the global currency that a shocking IMF report is proposing.
[00:10:43.842 --> 00:10:47.125]  Again, this is all public now on the IMF's website.
[00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:51.328]  The new global currency backed up with your carbon taxes.
[00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:54.591]  Continuing, Ron Paul calls for audit of US gold reserves.
[00:10:55.031 --> 00:10:59.353]  If you can't get the audit of the private secret of Federal Reserve, look at an audit of the gold reserves.
[00:10:59.353 --> 00:11:06.837]  We haven't had one in more than 60 years, and there's a lot of evidence that the gold has been stolen, given to the private banks.
[00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:08.458]  Huge news on that front.
[00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:16.462]  An incredible story about time to ditch the 20 billion plastic bags, and it goes on to say the government wants to pass laws in England and the U.S.
[00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:22.505]  to not let you wash your clothes, and to line underwear and clothes with colloidal silver, so that
[00:11:23.565 --> 00:11:27.610]  So that there's no infection problem and you'll just have to stink in your clothes.
[00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.791]  You cannot make this up.
[00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:30.513]  I'll be covering that later.
[00:11:30.513 --> 00:11:33.896]  Also, Woody Allen says New York too expensive for shooting films.
[00:11:33.896 --> 00:11:37.020]  But he's a big socialist that loves big government and taxes.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.123]  There's a new bagels tax in New York.
[00:11:40.123 --> 00:11:42.485]  Literally more than 80 plus new taxes passed.
[00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:49.588]  It continues with just all these incredible announcements of taxation and regulation.
[00:11:49.588 --> 00:11:58.031]  I'll mine back through the economic stack coming up after I get into some of the other news.
[00:11:58.031 --> 00:12:01.292]  Now, this is very important when I'm about to cover.
[00:12:01.292 --> 00:12:04.913]  And I want to preface it with this statement right now.
[00:12:06.462 --> 00:12:11.667]  We reverse engineered in the last 15 years everything that was being covertly built.
[00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:21.716]  The private spy networks, the merger of the military, National Guard, local police, under CIA control in the fusion centers.
[00:12:21.716 --> 00:12:25.759]  It's now all admitted, Washington Post, New York Times, but they say how great it is.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:40.812]  The face scanning cameras, the license plate reading cameras, the control grids, the automatic kill switches being put in all the new cars that the government can just activate, cell phones tracking you in real time, Google being an NSA front.
[00:12:40.812 --> 00:12:43.595]  It is now all admitted.
[00:12:43.595 --> 00:12:44.776]  There's no more denial.
[00:12:44.776 --> 00:12:49.660]  World government, world taxes, unelected, unaccountable, total tyranny.
[00:12:50.945 --> 00:13:08.857]  I remember back in 1998, all over the nation, in literally thousands of school districts, a multi-billion dollar program where they would take local police or local sheriff's deputies and deputize them to teach a law enforcement class to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders in a three-year program.
[00:13:09.457 --> 00:13:19.665]  And then they would federally deputize and pay with a grant to multiple officers to be ATF in the school, having the children write dossiers on their parents.
[00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:25.210]  I have copies of it in my film Police State 2 The Takeover from 2000.
[00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.593]  Actual school memos.
[00:13:28.593 --> 00:13:30.775]  Training them to spy on their parents.
[00:13:30.775 --> 00:13:34.518]  It says they get access on the recess, access at lunch.
[00:13:36.403 --> 00:13:38.605]  Turning them into confidential informants.
[00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:44.469]  I have local newscasts in Austin and ads on TV saying you get 200 bucks when you turn your parents in.
[00:13:44.469 --> 00:13:49.292]  Here's your tattletale card and your identifying number with the children smiling.
[00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:51.033]  That's in Road to Tyranny, 2002.
[00:13:51.033 --> 00:13:57.197]  This is a full corporate takeover of everything.
[00:13:58.257 --> 00:14:07.703]  Auto industry, banking, agriculture, only mega corporations are allowed to have businesses and operate under this system.
[00:14:07.703 --> 00:14:12.867]  This is a total mafia takeover of society.
[00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:24.135]  Then in the last decade, I've seen reports out of Chicago, LA, and many other major big cities, where entire public schools, if you're in that district, you go to a military academy.
[00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:33.602]  And at these military academies, they train them in every news article to take on gun owners, militias, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:14:33.602 --> 00:14:35.964]  We were reporting this 12 years ago.
[00:14:35.964 --> 00:14:38.186]  We were getting internal memos then.
[00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:48.114]  It only caught national attention in 2009 when we got the MIAC and Homeland Security reports stating the same thing from Homeland Security.
[00:14:48.114 --> 00:14:49.936]  Exposing the Homeland Security operation.
[00:14:51.738 --> 00:14:53.959]  So this is 100% confirmed.
[00:14:53.959 --> 00:14:57.901]  They've got over 50,000 preachers with a clergy response team.
[00:14:57.901 --> 00:14:59.061]  Total tyranny.
[00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:06.845]  Trained to teach their flocks that turning in your guns is good, that going to FEMA camps are good, that taking inoculations are good.
[00:15:06.845 --> 00:15:10.066]  We posted the hundreds of pages of secret documents.
[00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:14.868]  Two years later, national and local news came out and said, yes, it's great.
[00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:16.549]  We're training for martial law.
[00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:19.190]  And they showed images from the movie, The Siege,
[00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.017]  With Bruce Willis of Americans in a Camp.
[00:15:22.017 --> 00:15:23.722]  And they said, this is good.
[00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:25.547]  The preachers will help put you in the camp.
[00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:39.039]  Now, I mean, this is a giant, covert, criminal operation, but it's compartmentalized where even the average police officer or military person, unless they're in intelligence, knows almost nothing about it.
[00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:46.765]  They're always given cover stories and cover reasons for what this program is really about, the program that they're involved in.
[00:15:46.765 --> 00:15:49.287]  I mean, here's the analogy.
[00:15:50.507 --> 00:15:50.827]  of that.
[00:16:13.894 --> 00:16:21.716]  He knows exactly what he's doing, he knows where they're going, and he has all the information about what's happening on that ship.
[00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:30.197]  And the corporation, based back on the mainland, it has all the full info about all the ships and everything they're doing.
[00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:38.479]  So all I've done in 17 years, 15 years on air, is analyze all their admitted operations and put the pieces together.
[00:16:39.179 --> 00:17:00.219]  Then, more and more, the globalists in the CFR, Club of Rome, UN, at the highest management levels, are so arrogant, they've put out hundreds and hundreds that I've seen, there's no doubt thousands, of actual full-spectrum dominance briefings to their highest-level minions about the plan.
[00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:02.961]  And so we know exactly what it is.
[00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:04.382]  So, you're a police officer.
[00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:07.786]  You're like a cook on the ship.
[00:17:07.786 --> 00:17:09.947]  You're a bureaucrat.
[00:17:09.947 --> 00:17:12.629]  You're like somebody in the engine room.
[00:17:12.629 --> 00:17:15.710]  You aren't bad.
[00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:21.313]  But the captain is very bad, and the company that owns the ship is the devil.
[00:17:22.762 --> 00:17:43.660]  If you want to boil it down to what's at the end of the rabbit hole, pure evil, pure eugenics, total full spectrum dominance to take over the planet, shut off your resources, bankrupt you, end the family, fully change the human species, and exterminate the majority of the population.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.464]  This is the stated operation.
[00:17:47.464 --> 00:17:47.584]  Now,
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:54.406]  Just in the last 48 hours, they have decided to go full-bore public.
[00:17:54.406 --> 00:18:03.656]  They have now admitted all over the news, we've got pre-crime systems, it's total quackery, where you're not guilty until proven innocent, you're guilty when you've done nothing wrong.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.722]  It's going in everywhere.
[00:18:06.722 --> 00:18:08.623]  It's already in place.
[00:18:08.623 --> 00:18:12.827]  It's in literally hundreds and hundreds of newspapers.
[00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:14.949]  They are now making the announcement.
[00:18:14.949 --> 00:18:16.370]  And they're making other announcements.
[00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.673]  Look at this Time Magazine article.
[00:18:19.673 --> 00:18:23.377]  The government's new right to track your every move with GPS.
[00:18:23.377 --> 00:18:25.979]  It says the government has rights now.
[00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:27.401]  You don't have rights.
[00:18:27.401 --> 00:18:28.662]  The government has a right.
[00:18:29.082 --> 00:18:32.844]  And it goes on to say they can track your cell phone in real time without warrants.
[00:18:32.844 --> 00:18:37.066]  They can trespass on your property and put GPS on your car.
[00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:38.206]  No warrant.
[00:18:38.206 --> 00:18:39.887]  You have no Fourth Amendment.
[00:18:39.887 --> 00:18:42.088]  That's their new right!
[00:18:43.143 --> 00:18:51.189]  See, the global corporations are lawless, and they write the rules now, and they exempt themselves from all the rules they write for us.
[00:18:51.189 --> 00:18:56.712]  Government agents can sneak onto your property in the middle of the night, put a GPS device on the bottom of your car and keep track of everywhere you go.
[00:18:56.712 --> 00:19:02.576]  This doesn't violate your Fourth Amendment rights because you do not have any reasonable expectation of privacy in your own driveway.
[00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:05.939]  Your own private property has privacy in all the other court rulings.
[00:19:05.939 --> 00:19:10.462]  But see, they're now changing the precedence, the controlling circuit courts.
[00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:14.483]  I mean, this is pure treason.
[00:19:14.483 --> 00:19:15.963]  Hey, we are allowed to torture.
[00:19:15.963 --> 00:19:17.944]  We're allowed to secretly arrest you.
[00:19:17.944 --> 00:19:22.847]  Twelve states will arrest you if you videotape cops from a half mile away.
[00:19:22.847 --> 00:19:25.789]  They say, oh, it's wiretapping, when the statute doesn't even say that.
[00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:28.230]  There's no perception of privacy in public.
[00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.971]  They're going to videotape you.
[00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:31.512]  They're going to come on your property.
[00:19:32.622 --> 00:19:34.824]  But you have no rights.
[00:19:34.824 --> 00:19:39.727]  That is the bizarre and scary rule that now applies in California and eight other western states.
[00:19:39.727 --> 00:19:40.008]  The U.S.
[00:19:40.008 --> 00:19:49.595]  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers the vast jurisdiction recently decided the government, can monitor you in this way virtually any time at once with no need for a search warrant.
[00:19:49.595 --> 00:19:55.500]  Now when we come back, nationwide the military has taken over the public schools.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500]  This is hardcore.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:56.901]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:03.196]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[00:20:03.196 --> 00:20:12.000]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:24.485]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[00:20:24.485 --> 00:20:25.386]  But don't wait!
[00:20:25.386 --> 00:20:28.367]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:29.108]  I think so.
[00:20:45.626 --> 00:20:48.148]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[00:20:48.148 --> 00:20:50.029]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.129]  800-876-2966.
[00:20:50.129 --> 00:20:50.310]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[00:21:00.936 --> 00:21:05.617]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:52.844 --> 00:22:08.194]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:22:08.194 --> 00:22:19.262]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on prisonplanet.com.
[00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:28.518]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:22:28.518 --> 00:22:33.079]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:48.283]  Now I'm offering 50 all-organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds, so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:22:49.264 --> 00:22:51.986]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:22:51.986 --> 00:23:00.432]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb, and my company is SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:23:00.432 --> 00:23:01.653]  Attention to all U.S.
[00:23:01.653 --> 00:23:09.618]  drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles with an auto warranty about to expire or no warranty coverage at all.
[00:23:09.618 --> 00:23:15.682]  Due to our country's economic crisis and auto repair costs on the rise, if your vehicle has less than 130,000 miles, as of today,
[00:23:18.004 --> 00:23:28.293]  You could be one of the millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle covered under United Repair Plans and have 100% of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you.
[00:23:28.293 --> 00:23:32.977]  This low-cost vehicle service contract has been established under United Repair Plans.
[00:23:33.197 --> 00:23:40.242]  And is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession.

[00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:50.270]  Again, that's 800-809-4491.
[00:24:01.317 --> 00:24:07.141]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.141 --> 00:24:11.745]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.745 --> 00:24:14.447]  So now they come out and throw the gauntlet down.
[00:24:14.447 --> 00:24:16.368]  Yeah, there's a world government.
[00:24:16.368 --> 00:24:18.670]  We want a world one child.
[00:24:19.986 --> 00:24:21.848]  Tax.
[00:24:21.848 --> 00:24:25.211]  We're gonna ban you having bathtubs or showers.
[00:24:25.211 --> 00:24:33.180]  We've already told you what type of toilet you can have or dishwasher or clothes washer or how your house has to be built.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:39.926]  Now we're gonna tell you that you're not allowed to wash your underwear and that they all have to be lined with colloidal silver so that it disinfects.
[00:24:39.926 --> 00:24:40.887]  That's CNBC.
[00:24:42.196 --> 00:24:44.297]  Prince Charles says you can't have a shower.
[00:24:44.297 --> 00:24:56.482]  The New York Times comes out and says children are writing fake tickets as part of a public school program funded by the UN and they go home and tell mommy you're not allowed to take a bath or keep the water running while you brush your teeth.
[00:24:56.482 --> 00:24:59.523]  Training the children to be the enforcers for the state.
[00:24:59.523 --> 00:25:06.526]  And now they come out in Time Magazine and say the government's new right to track your every move with GPS.
[00:25:08.427 --> 00:25:14.192]  And they're also ruling on every other type of nightmare because they are a rogue criminal group.
[00:25:14.192 --> 00:25:20.537]  If they could steal $28 trillion and counting in the last two years and get away with it and tell Congress, we're not going to tell you where the money went.
[00:25:20.537 --> 00:25:24.100]  If they can tell Congress, we're not going to tell you where all the gold at Fort Knox went.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.962]  Ron Paul's going to try to introduce a bill to find out.
[00:25:26.962 --> 00:25:27.903]  They can get away with anything!
[00:25:29.906 --> 00:25:32.687]  They lied to you and said they weren't keeping the naked body scanner images.
[00:25:32.687 --> 00:25:34.888]  Now they admit they were lying on purpose.
[00:25:34.888 --> 00:25:37.149]  They lied and said they weren't taking your baby's blood at birth.
[00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:45.432]  Now they admit they did and put it in a Pentagon database, like I told you 12, 13 years ago, because I have the secret documents given to me by a nurse.
[00:25:45.432 --> 00:25:46.852]  This isn't a game!
[00:25:46.852 --> 00:25:50.054]  You understand how creepy that is, to have over 50,000 preachers?
[00:25:50.054 --> 00:25:52.134]  That's the last time we got numbers three years ago.
[00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:55.075]  It was set to double each year, so it should be 150,000 by now, or more.
[00:25:58.373 --> 00:26:09.284]  I mean, imagine these preachers, they get called in and say, we want you to be a secret FEMA officer, we're going to give you secret federal funding, and here's the training manuals, teach them to submit to government, and here's examples.
[00:26:09.284 --> 00:26:12.187]  Take the shots, go to the camp, give us their property.
[00:26:12.187 --> 00:26:13.348]  It's of the Lord.
[00:26:13.348 --> 00:26:18.554]  And suddenly there's preachers all over TV, it's of the Lord to do whatever government tells you.
[00:26:18.554 --> 00:26:21.417]  I mean, don't these preachers know that they're living in a secret police
[00:26:21.957 --> 00:26:23.479]  Horrifying system.
[00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:25.322]  They should run out warning everyone.
[00:26:25.322 --> 00:26:29.367]  They should run down the streets going, secret police are trying to hire preachers.
[00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:30.649]  It's totally evil.
[00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:34.013]  It's a total authoritarian secret police takeover.
[00:26:35.779 --> 00:26:36.779]  Warn everyone!
[00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:37.760]  We're in danger!
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.740]  History shows it!
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.200]  Emergency!
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.021]  There's a million plus.
[00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:44.682]  Washington Post says 854,000.
[00:26:44.682 --> 00:26:46.162]  But it's much more.
[00:26:46.162 --> 00:26:49.303]  Private spies with the highest level security clearance.
[00:26:49.303 --> 00:26:51.143]  They're hiring private mercenaries.
[00:26:51.143 --> 00:26:52.704]  They're building FEMA camps.
[00:26:52.704 --> 00:26:56.145]  The National Centers, National Emergency Centers Act.
[00:26:56.145 --> 00:26:57.785]  We've got to warn people.
[00:26:57.785 --> 00:26:59.566]  Instead it's like, absolutely.
[00:27:00.266 --> 00:27:08.113]  I mean, they put preachers on TV going, we are part of a plan to help people go to the camps, to help the government deal with its main threat, the people.
[00:27:08.113 --> 00:27:09.034]  That's a quote.
[00:27:09.034 --> 00:27:10.595]  The newscast goes, that's right.
[00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:13.818]  The number one threat is the American people to the government.
[00:27:13.818 --> 00:27:18.622]  It's all about the government and what it needs and the government's new rights.
[00:27:18.622 --> 00:27:19.743]  That you have no rights.
[00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:24.368]  That we'll film you in public, but if you film us, we'll arrest you.
[00:27:24.368 --> 00:27:26.090]  How does that sound, slave?
[00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.374]  We'll scan your little naked children and save the images.
[00:27:29.374 --> 00:27:31.476]  We'll steal their blood at birth.
[00:27:31.476 --> 00:27:35.661]  We'll give the bankers all the money they want and won't let Congress find out where it went.
[00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:41.504]  We'll launch all these new wars, we'll put deadly poison in the water, and we're gonna add lithium.
[00:27:41.504 --> 00:27:46.746]  We'll shoot your kids up with stuff that gives them a tenfold increase in brain disorders and convulsions.
[00:27:46.746 --> 00:27:50.128]  We'll give little girls Gardasil shots, killing them en masse.
[00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:58.412]  And we'll test the soft kill publicly, and watch the people become maimed and die, and you'll do nothing about it, because we're acclimating you for total death!
[00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:09.175]  And we'll call people kooks and nuts and crazies that are upset by it and have strong instincts for liberty and say no.
[00:28:09.175 --> 00:28:09.916]  Here it is.
[00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:14.939]  The government's new right to track your every move with GPS.
[00:28:14.939 --> 00:28:17.561]  And it says the Ninth Circuit has ruled there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:28:18.976 --> 00:28:22.780]  Contravening all other rulings in history in this country.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.803]  It's completely backwards and they just say, that's how it is.
[00:28:26.803 --> 00:28:28.305]  It's a new time.
[00:28:28.305 --> 00:28:31.988]  We've got to stop the drugs that the government ships in.
[00:28:31.988 --> 00:28:34.270]  Here's another one.
[00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.831]  It's in Forbes.
[00:28:35.831 --> 00:28:39.094]  Paul Watson wrote a detailed article giving you the full spectrum history of it.
[00:28:39.094 --> 00:28:42.658]  Fourth Amendment violating mobile x-ray scanners hit the streets.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.781]  And it says hundreds of these are being ordered by the government.
[00:28:47.781 --> 00:28:52.002]  They're super high-powered x-ray machines.
[00:28:52.002 --> 00:28:54.703]  Thousands, not hundreds.
[00:28:54.703 --> 00:28:56.023]  I've read the specs.
[00:28:56.023 --> 00:28:56.804]  Thousands.
[00:28:56.804 --> 00:29:00.225]  There's different variants, but they're all many, many times more powerful.
[00:29:00.225 --> 00:29:01.825]  Many of them, thousands of times.
[00:29:01.825 --> 00:29:06.867]  They can passively, the super high-powered scanners, they've got to roll the car through them.
[00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:07.607]  No, no, no, no.
[00:29:07.607 --> 00:29:13.489]  These are so powerful that they drive by your house and look through metal walls.
[00:29:14.403 --> 00:29:15.365]  Brick walls.
[00:29:15.365 --> 00:29:16.707]  They look right through your car.
[00:29:16.707 --> 00:29:18.209]  Go to Forbes.
[00:29:18.209 --> 00:29:23.918]  It shows the trucks, and they're looking through a Ryder truck, through houses, and it shows everything you're doing.
[00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:27.117]  Blasting!
[00:29:27.117 --> 00:29:30.058]  Do you have any idea what this is going to do to the people sitting in the trucks?
[00:29:30.058 --> 00:29:34.520]  But just like DU, they know it's killing everybody that comes in contact with it.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.461]  When you die, they'll just have a media cover-up.
[00:29:36.461 --> 00:29:40.382]  This is the absolute key information when we come back.
[00:29:40.382 --> 00:29:43.163]  Because it shows the philosophy of the globalists.
[00:29:43.163 --> 00:29:44.744]  This information is so vital.
[00:29:44.744 --> 00:29:50.486]  I'm going to give you the absolute key to everything understanding their mindset straight ahead.
[00:29:50.486 --> 00:29:51.886]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.886 --> 00:29:53.407]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.398 --> 00:30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.202]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:10.605]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:10.605 --> 00:30:17.988]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:17.988 --> 00:30:22.530]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:30:35.774 --> 00:30:41.476]  As partner and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:30:42.556 --> 00:30:46.440]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:06.174]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:09.057]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:32:09.057 --> 00:32:14.443]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:33:01.903 --> 00:33:03.825]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:03.825 --> 00:33:05.206]  A lie!
[00:33:05.206 --> 00:33:07.207]  No man is obsolete!
[00:33:07.207 --> 00:33:09.089]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:12.312]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:33:12.312 --> 00:33:17.776]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:33:17.776 --> 00:33:19.458]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:20.539]  A crawling insect!
[00:33:21.219 --> 00:33:25.623]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:33:25.623 --> 00:33:27.124]  I am a human being!
[00:33:27.124 --> 00:33:34.869]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[00:33:34.869 --> 00:33:36.010]  I don't care!
[00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.031]  I tell you, I don't care!
[00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:38.412]  I'm a human being!
[00:33:38.412 --> 00:33:39.113]  I exist!
[00:33:40.191 --> 00:33:46.313]  If I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[00:33:46.313 --> 00:33:49.474]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:33:49.474 --> 00:33:57.156]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[00:33:57.156 --> 00:34:02.518]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the strength has no use for your pride!
[00:34:04.204 --> 00:34:08.306]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:08.306 --> 00:34:10.607]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:10.607 --> 00:34:15.149]  We're gonna open the phones up throughout the full transmission.
[00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:17.429]  1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 Alright, here's the key.
[00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.530]  We are psychologically being trained to accept death.
[00:34:34.807 --> 00:34:42.209]  The average life expectancy is 51 for Exxon Valdez workers, when the average life expectancy is over 75 in this country.
[00:34:42.209 --> 00:34:46.389]  74 for men, 76, 77 for women.
[00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:49.590]  Almost all the Exxon Valdez workers are dead.
[00:34:49.590 --> 00:35:00.793]  Obama and the EPA come out and say, there's no health problems in the Gulf, even though they've used hundreds of times the dispersant, 40 plus million gallons, all the crude oil.
[00:35:00.793 --> 00:35:02.433]  They told them, don't wear mask,
[00:35:03.763 --> 00:35:08.284]  You'll scare the public, there's no problem as you collapse, and many have already died.
[00:35:08.284 --> 00:35:18.247]  That's mainstream news, but Obama and the media say it's fine, the government says it's fine, but then other newspapers tell the truth and talk about the illnesses and the deaths.
[00:35:18.247 --> 00:35:24.148]  And even BP doctors have gone public and come out and said people are getting sick and dying and there's a cover-up going on.
[00:35:25.563 --> 00:35:27.665]  It's the same thing with depleted uranium.
[00:35:27.665 --> 00:35:37.374]  There was a report in 1946 dealing with radioactive gas weapons using DU gas bombs against the Soviets.
[00:35:37.374 --> 00:35:41.277]  And the Pentagon, the newly built Pentagon, decided we will not use this.
[00:35:41.277 --> 00:35:41.938]  It's too deadly.
[00:35:41.938 --> 00:35:42.979]  It's a blowback.
[00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:45.921]  And the half-life of DU is billions of years.
[00:35:45.921 --> 00:35:46.281]  What is it?
[00:35:46.281 --> 00:35:47.082]  Four and a half billion?
[00:35:47.082 --> 00:35:47.763]  I'm going from memory.
[00:35:47.763 --> 00:35:49.244]  I know it's over four billion years.
[00:35:49.244 --> 00:35:50.045]  The half-life.
[00:35:51.303 --> 00:35:52.565]  Okay?
[00:35:52.565 --> 00:35:57.451]  It is fresh and has the maximum effect for billions of years.
[00:35:57.451 --> 00:35:59.193]  For all intents and purposes, forever!
[00:36:01.875 --> 00:36:09.397]  And now they're not just using it in Abrams Sabo rounds or in Warthog Vulcan machine gun cannons.
[00:36:09.397 --> 00:36:13.538]  They're serving it out to .50 calibers to .223s.
[00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:20.559]  You name it, it's being used in proving grounds all over the U.S., all over Hawaii, all over Puerto Rico.
[00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:21.680]  The people complain.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.820]  They say, shut up!
[00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.791]  Shut up!
[00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:38.717]  And when you fire DU, it aerosolizes when it hits the targets, it turns into powder, it ignites because the friction is so great, and burns, and turns into a powder that's radioactive and poisonous.
[00:36:38.717 --> 00:36:52.564]  We've had the former head of the Pentagon's DU program, Dr. Doug Rockey, PhD, and now scientists are reporting, there's reports in the US, England, and Iraq, a four-fold increase in cancers in cities where this was used.
[00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:56.305]  Mainly Republican Guard bases were bombed with it.
[00:36:56.305 --> 00:36:57.666]  And where did our troops move in?
[00:36:57.666 --> 00:37:00.887]  The Republican Guard bases, with the blast holes, bombed out.
[00:37:00.887 --> 00:37:06.369]  They would dump sand on top of the blast holes, supposedly containing the DU.
[00:37:06.369 --> 00:37:13.731]  A dump truck, a sand on a blast hole, on a crater, and then of course the desert winds, the sand blowing around.
[00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:19.633]  You're seeing massive increases in lung cancer, in skin cancer, in organ failure.
[00:37:19.633 --> 00:37:22.034]  Again, we've had the medical doctors on about this in our troops.
[00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.411]  Now, I said this is the key to everything.
[00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:30.134]  This is the key.
[00:37:30.134 --> 00:37:36.177]  First, they put cars at the border through high-powered x-ray machines where you drive under it and it scans.
[00:37:37.148 --> 00:37:50.536]  Then they put naked body scanners in and lie about the radiation and scores of top scientists are now, LA Times, New York Times, saying it's incredibly deadly, there's two different machines, 20 to 50 times the radiation.
[00:37:50.536 --> 00:37:53.038]  They lie and say we're not recording the images.
[00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:54.378]  Now they admit they are.
[00:37:54.378 --> 00:37:56.580]  So they're training you to be bathed in radiation.
[00:37:58.066 --> 00:38:06.990]  And by the time you get angry by that, they've already jumped on to the next thing, so you're fighting that, and the old tyranny now doesn't seem as bad.
[00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:16.774]  So they take you a million miles down the road of despotism and dehumanization and scientific poisoning and death and radiation.
[00:38:17.714 --> 00:38:25.497]  And you push back 500,000 miles with everything you've got, they've still got you 500,000 miles down the road to tyranny.
[00:38:25.497 --> 00:38:27.698]  Then they bring you another million miles.
[00:38:27.698 --> 00:38:31.220]  You battle back another 600,000 miles.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.441]  You're still 900,000 miles down the rat hole.
[00:38:34.441 --> 00:38:36.802]  Then they take you 10 million miles.
[00:38:36.802 --> 00:38:39.083]  You battle back 9 million miles.
[00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:43.225]  Now you're 1,900,000 miles down the rat hole to hell.
[00:38:43.225 --> 00:38:45.886]  Then they take you a trillion miles into tyranny.
[00:38:45.886 --> 00:38:46.767]  You battle back
[00:38:47.347 --> 00:38:49.751]  Hundreds of millions of miles!
[00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:50.452]  It's over.
[00:38:50.452 --> 00:38:52.435]  It's too late.
[00:38:52.435 --> 00:38:53.095]  That's their plan.
[00:38:54.451 --> 00:38:57.853]  And they're now not jumping hundreds of miles or thousands of miles.
[00:38:57.853 --> 00:39:00.234]  They're now jumping millions of miles.
[00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:03.536]  We've got to run screaming through the streets, metaphorically.
[00:39:03.536 --> 00:39:05.157]  We've got to pull our hair out.
[00:39:05.157 --> 00:39:09.059]  We've got to stand there in grocery store lines and start yelling about the New World Order.
[00:39:09.059 --> 00:39:10.960]  We've got to do banner hangs everywhere.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.681]  We've got to call in to talk radio.
[00:39:12.681 --> 00:39:14.662]  We've got to email everybody we know every day.
[00:39:14.662 --> 00:39:16.183]  We've got to get self-sufficient.
[00:39:16.183 --> 00:39:19.624]  We've got to warn everyone because they're trying to break our will.
[00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:22.026]  Now, again, here's the key.
[00:39:23.286 --> 00:39:24.967]  In England, this already started five years ago.
[00:39:24.967 --> 00:39:26.308]  That's how I knew it would come here.
[00:39:26.308 --> 00:39:28.329]  Naked body, mobile vans.
[00:39:28.329 --> 00:39:30.471]  I told you it'd go in the courthouses, federal and state.
[00:39:30.471 --> 00:39:31.291]  Now it's happened.
[00:39:31.291 --> 00:39:33.373]  They're saving every image.
[00:39:33.373 --> 00:39:37.856]  34,000 images in one city, Orlando alone, at the federal courthouse.
[00:39:37.856 --> 00:39:40.457]  Of your children, of your wife, saving it all.
[00:39:40.457 --> 00:39:41.878]  At the airport, saving it all.
[00:39:41.878 --> 00:39:44.000]  Bathing you in radiation.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.084]  Now, if it isn't enough to have the Border Patrol in checkpoints up to 100 miles in, in this Constitution-free zone,
[00:39:52.145 --> 00:40:00.132]  The Border Patrol, all the research shows, are being backscattered with more power than chest x-rays every day.
[00:40:00.132 --> 00:40:08.879]  And when you get sick, like the troops that breathe DU, they're just going to keep it quiet in the news, or it'll even come out and they'll block you getting any aid.
[00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:12.783]  Just like they told the 9-11 workers, hey, you're breathing asbestos, it's not bad for you.
[00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:14.526]  Many of them are dead.
[00:40:14.526 --> 00:40:16.147]  What, 3,000 plus?
[00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:18.987]  All the dogs died within five years that breathed it.
[00:40:18.987 --> 00:40:21.108]  Nasal cancer, lung cancer.
[00:40:21.108 --> 00:40:28.169]  The major university medical centers do the lung scans, say they're full of asbestos, full of all these chemicals.
[00:40:28.169 --> 00:40:28.850]  They're dying.
[00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:33.811]  Government, almost nine years later, says, you don't get any health care.
[00:40:33.811 --> 00:40:37.932]  Oh, Bush stands up there on the rubble and poses as a patriot.
[00:40:37.932 --> 00:40:42.193]  Glenn Beck, who said he detests 9-11 victims, stands on the rubble.
[00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:45.861]  Now, you know, goes to ground zero in grandstands.
[00:40:45.861 --> 00:40:48.903]  It's only on the surface of their patriotism.
[00:40:48.903 --> 00:40:55.427]  So they're setting the precedent to give you Gardasil and it causes autoimmune disorders, brain damage, death.
[00:40:55.427 --> 00:40:56.989]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:40:56.989 --> 00:40:59.290]  They come out with the H1N1 shot.
[00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.731]  Hundreds of thousands get sick.
[00:41:00.731 --> 00:41:04.774]  Guillain-Barré, tenfold increase in seizures, neurological disorders.
[00:41:04.774 --> 00:41:05.975]  It's all admitted.
[00:41:05.975 --> 00:41:07.216]  British Medical Journal.
[00:41:07.216 --> 00:41:07.876]  They don't care.
[00:41:07.876 --> 00:41:09.798]  They keep rolling it out with it again this year.
[00:41:10.498 --> 00:41:12.398]  They're just setting the precedent.
[00:41:12.398 --> 00:41:15.419]  They're charging up the hill on us, firing and attacking.
[00:41:15.419 --> 00:41:16.900]  They're not backing down.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:23.541]  And they got loudspeakers blaring, we're your friends, we're the government, we love you, we care about you, we're doing this for your own good.
[00:41:23.541 --> 00:41:29.363]  They got billboards up everywhere, tattle on your parents, tattle on your boss, turn in your neighbor, get some cash.
[00:41:29.363 --> 00:41:32.463]  That's all off the charts.
[00:41:32.463 --> 00:41:34.444]  They're turning us against each other at every level.
[00:41:37.839 --> 00:41:48.602]  And now they come out and say, we've got super high powered mobile trucks that are gonna roll around America with super high powered x-rays, so powerful.
[00:41:48.602 --> 00:41:58.144]  I mean, it's a super dose to be chest x-rayed, just to shoot through some meat at point blank range from a foot away.
[00:41:58.144 --> 00:42:03.926]  They've got statistics that if you get more than a handful of chest x-rays, your cancer levels just go off the chart.
[00:42:06.155 --> 00:42:16.623]  These are systems conservatively thousands of times stronger, and the people in the trucks are getting backscatter splatter when they're aiming this thing.
[00:42:16.623 --> 00:42:22.748]  You're in your house, you're on the highway, and they're driving around hitting you with high-powered radiation.
[00:42:22.748 --> 00:42:30.675]  I mean, they found out 20-plus years ago that cops were sticking radar guns between their legs on their motorcycles or squad cars.
[00:42:30.675 --> 00:42:34.418]  I drive down 290 every day, almost every day, and see motorcycle cops
[00:42:36.966 --> 00:42:42.727]  Sitting there on their motorcycles, and when they're done aiming their radar gun at me, they stick it between their legs.
[00:42:42.727 --> 00:42:44.208]  Even though they tell them don't do that.
[00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:47.649]  And have you seen the statistics on police officers' testicular cancer?
[00:42:47.649 --> 00:42:54.150]  Because even though they're not firing the ray, that device is broadcasting some of it.
[00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.711]  And it's cooking their genitalia.
[00:42:56.584 --> 00:43:13.855]  How many thousands of studies about cell phones with the microwave scrambler relay heating the brain at least one degree after five minutes of average cell phone use, and it varies cell phone to cell phone, admitting it's gonna give you cancer, and they even let you know it's gonna give you cancer.
[00:43:13.855 --> 00:43:16.296]  But we're just like wild deer.
[00:43:16.296 --> 00:43:18.097]  This is the key.
[00:43:18.097 --> 00:43:25.562]  Wild deer, and they've done studies in North America, they've done it in Africa, they've done it in Asia, as well as Europe,
[00:43:26.772 --> 00:43:37.396]  You can put poison in a water supply, in a pool, in a pond, the deer will come and drink it, even though they see other deer dying from it, they can't make the connection.
[00:43:37.396 --> 00:43:41.638]  Just like rats can't make the connection.
[00:43:41.638 --> 00:43:51.521]  And so, even though you know bisphenol A is giving you cancer and hurting you, and I was sent an email, I'm mispronouncing it, is it bisphenol?
[00:43:51.521 --> 00:43:55.203]  Bisphenol A. Admittedly, bisphenol A.
[00:43:56.716 --> 00:44:05.740]  Even though that's happening, they put it out there before us, and I catch myself, like a little monkey, reaching up to get the little juice drink I want.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:11.862]  I catch myself, you know, my kids are begging for the corn syrup lifesavers, I catch myself still giving it to them.
[00:44:13.223 --> 00:44:24.977]  Because the force of habit is so powerful that I grew up eating lifesavers and they look colorful and they look like fruit to my primitive brain, my hardwiring.
[00:44:24.977 --> 00:44:28.822]  I still have to fight to not give it to them when they're asking lovingly.
[00:44:32.478 --> 00:44:33.818]  And it's the same thing.
[00:44:33.818 --> 00:44:36.779]  These guys work for these body scanner companies.
[00:44:36.779 --> 00:44:38.080]  They work for the TSA.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:38.800]  It's their job.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.360]  They do it.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.061]  Killing themselves to live.
[00:44:41.061 --> 00:44:47.463]  The people rolling out with these companies with these high-powered x-rays, they're just like the troops.
[00:44:47.463 --> 00:44:49.003]  They're gonna go breathe the DU.
[00:44:49.003 --> 00:44:51.964]  They're gonna go bathe in the radiation.
[00:44:51.964 --> 00:44:54.885]  Fourth Amendment violating mobile x-ray scanners hit the streets.
[00:44:56.337 --> 00:45:15.246]  As we warned at the beginning of this year, x-ray body scanners currently being used and abused in airports across the world are set to hit the streets as American science and engineering reveals that more than 500 batch scatter x-ray scanners mounted in vans that can be driven past neighborhoods vehicles to see their contents have been sold to government agencies.
[00:45:15.246 --> 00:45:23.090]  More than 500 mobile vans so powerful that they shoot through metal and brick
[00:45:28.547 --> 00:45:30.428]  If you try to go, I mean, they're assaulting you.
[00:45:30.428 --> 00:45:32.850]  They drive by and hit your car, your house with this.
[00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.672]  You're being assaulted.
[00:45:34.672 --> 00:45:39.335]  But you try to pull them over, you try to stop them, they'll call a SWAT team and say terrorists are attacking.
[00:45:39.335 --> 00:45:45.480]  And those SWAT team guys drinking bisphenol A, drinking sodium fluoride, shooting themselves up.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.241]  They have no idea.
[00:45:46.241 --> 00:45:50.144]  They'll, they'll, they will get in a gun battle with you and kill you faster than you can imagine.
[00:45:53.626 --> 00:46:08.473]  They're now rolling out worldwide, the governments are admitting, within 10 years they want you to retina scan to buy and sell, and major banks and governments are continually the number one source of people getting your personal data for identity theft.
[00:46:08.473 --> 00:46:10.554]  They create the crisis, offer the solution.
[00:46:13.254 --> 00:46:16.455]  They are assaulting you and your family when they put you in a body scanner.
[00:46:16.455 --> 00:46:19.076]  They are assaulting your privacy and your DNA.
[00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.237]  It wrecks your DNA.
[00:46:20.237 --> 00:46:21.617]  It hurts the next generation.
[00:46:21.617 --> 00:46:24.778]  That's New York Times admitting it, but saying it's good.
[00:46:24.778 --> 00:46:26.679]  It's good we're wrecking your DNA.
[00:46:26.679 --> 00:46:27.999]  It's good!
[00:46:27.999 --> 00:46:36.222]  And now we're gonna hit you with something thousands of times more powerful, and they got 500 of these things already driving around, looking in your house.
[00:46:36.222 --> 00:46:38.743]  And you can go watch the video newscast about this.
[00:46:38.743 --> 00:46:40.764]  It shows people inside Ryder trucks.
[00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.966]  Of course, it's always in a simulation of terror.
[00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.008]  See, we need these.
[00:46:45.008 --> 00:46:47.510]  There's people inside the car.
[00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.132]  There's people hiding in that Ryder truck.
[00:46:50.132 --> 00:46:57.999]  They're driving around with a high-powered radiation beam of high-powered x-ray, blasting.
[00:46:57.999 --> 00:47:01.042]  The guy in the car is being fried!
[00:47:01.042 --> 00:47:04.845]  He'll love that big, fat, juicy brain tumor he gets.
[00:47:04.845 --> 00:47:05.485]  He'll love it!
[00:47:06.343 --> 00:47:09.104]  Have you noticed how they've taken our survival instinct away?
[00:47:09.104 --> 00:47:14.346]  I see the statistics of more and more yuppies don't even visit their parents for many, many years.
[00:47:14.346 --> 00:47:18.428]  They just stick them in these nursing homes.
[00:47:18.428 --> 00:47:26.752]  That's how the nursing homes get away with them, with worms and maggots and bedsores and living in their own feces and urine for weeks at a time.
[00:47:26.752 --> 00:47:31.334]  Same thing coming out of England and their hospitals, because nobody comes to see mama and papa.
[00:47:31.914 --> 00:47:38.117]  These yuppies are so busy getting drunk and partying and watching porn and betting on football games.
[00:47:38.117 --> 00:47:45.640]  Hey, daddy's over in another state, rotting right now, sitting there begging for death, rotting slow.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.362]  And as soon as his insurance runs out, they're gonna quietly give him morphine and hospice till he dies.
[00:47:51.636 --> 00:47:53.677]  You don't care if you're breathing DU.
[00:47:53.677 --> 00:47:55.557]  You don't care if you're getting radiated.
[00:47:55.557 --> 00:47:58.418]  You don't care if you're drinking poison in the food and water.
[00:47:58.418 --> 00:47:59.899]  You don't care.
[00:47:59.899 --> 00:48:05.201]  And so now, up until 1990, the military would not use DU.
[00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:06.241]  And a decision was made.
[00:48:06.241 --> 00:48:07.702]  We're going to use this all over America.
[00:48:08.482 --> 00:48:10.163]  The shooting ranges and proving grounds.
[00:48:10.163 --> 00:48:12.185]  We're going to use it all over the world.
[00:48:12.185 --> 00:48:14.866]  We're going to have our troops move into areas we've bombed.
[00:48:14.866 --> 00:48:19.330]  We're going to have people clean up the World Trade Center and say they don't need breathing apparatus.
[00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:27.015]  We're going to tell the people in the Gulf they don't need it because we'll have to admit it's dangerous and admit claims later.
[00:48:27.015 --> 00:48:32.479]  We're going to bomb nuclear reactors in Iran that have been loaded with uranium and cost Chernobyl's.
[00:48:32.479 --> 00:48:33.980]  Chernobyl's aren't bad anymore.
[00:48:35.506 --> 00:48:36.967]  This is the big secret.
[00:48:36.967 --> 00:48:42.770]  We're all just being acclimated to mass death, mass cancer, mass poisoning.
[00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:52.236]  I showed the National Guard a few months ago off local news in New York, showing them making citizens, they said they made over 2,000 arrests, drive under a radiation machine.
[00:48:52.236 --> 00:49:02.182]  It's so high powered, it's not as high powered as the ones that broadcast at a distance and shoot through walls in cars, that it's a wand, a big wand, they make you drive under it, and the families are driving under it.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:09.224]  And the military's going, yeah, we've made a lot of illegal gun seizures out here.
[00:49:09.224 --> 00:49:12.607]  We've made 2,000 arrests.
[00:49:12.607 --> 00:49:14.168]  And they cut to the mayor.
[00:49:14.168 --> 00:49:17.211]  Yeah, I think the army could stop crime here in Schenectady.
[00:49:17.211 --> 00:49:19.673]  I don't want them just running radiation machines.
[00:49:19.673 --> 00:49:21.474]  I want them searching everybody.
[00:49:21.474 --> 00:49:22.935]  Same thing in Illinois.
[00:49:22.935 --> 00:49:25.978]  I mean, this is so far past 1984.
[00:49:25.978 --> 00:49:29.961]  And they think you're so enslaved, they don't even care if you know.
[00:49:29.961 --> 00:49:31.883]  They don't even care if you're hearing me right now.
[00:49:32.847 --> 00:49:34.348]  They don't even care.
[00:49:34.348 --> 00:49:35.969]  They just think you're going to take it.
[00:49:35.969 --> 00:49:37.850]  They think you're going to go along with it.
[00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:45.274]  They think you're going to accept the new global currency that they've now named specifically and are rolling out.
[00:49:45.274 --> 00:49:52.618]  Can you imagine these cops and National Guard out there standing right at the side of the truck with a giant wand blasting down into the car?
[00:49:52.618 --> 00:49:58.922]  And if they've got full spectrum analysis systems, special spectrographs that can see
[00:50:00.353 --> 00:50:12.003]  The bouncing x-rays, you can look at those at university websites, and you can just see the cops and the troops, I mean it's just blasting light, shooting all over, just radiating them.
[00:50:12.003 --> 00:50:18.188]  And what's on the outside of a man is testicles, shooting right through, right through, right through, and they're just...
[00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:20.730]  I mean, what is wrong with you?
[00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.752]  What is wrong with you people?
[00:50:40.117 --> 00:50:44.641]  Cops, you think a radar gun's going to give you testicle cancer?
[00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:46.642]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:50:46.642 --> 00:50:50.686]  And there's epidemics of brain tumors, epidemics just from the cell phones.
[00:50:50.686 --> 00:50:52.767]  People are just like, that's how it is.
[00:50:52.767 --> 00:50:55.509]  I got a big fat brain tumor at 41.
[00:50:55.509 --> 00:50:56.650]  I'm going to die.
[00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.112]  That's just how it is.
[00:50:58.112 --> 00:51:02.195]  Football's coming up in a minute.
[00:51:02.195 --> 00:51:04.216]  Remain in your houses.
[00:51:04.216 --> 00:51:08.060]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.327]  Will they do it?
[00:51:11.327 --> 00:51:13.928]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:51:13.928 --> 00:51:20.390]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:22.591]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:51:22.591 --> 00:51:24.552]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:51:26.873 --> 00:51:31.755]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:36.657]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:51:36.657 --> 00:51:42.419]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:51:42.419 --> 00:51:50.823]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[00:51:50.823 --> 00:51:53.324]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.
[00:51:53.324 --> 00:51:56.105]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[00:51:56.425 --> 00:52:00.628]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:52:00.628 --> 00:52:05.611]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.611 --> 00:52:06.592]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.592 --> 00:52:09.053]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.053 --> 00:52:10.074]  A republic.
[00:52:10.074 --> 00:52:12.716]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.716 --> 00:52:14.977]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.977 --> 00:52:16.999]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.999 --> 00:52:18.680]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.001]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.001 --> 00:52:20.601]  Children?
[00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:21.722]  Our education?
[00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:22.562]  Our money?
[00:52:22.562 --> 00:52:26.205]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.565 --> 00:52:30.271]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.271 --> 00:52:31.533]  You're being warned.
[00:52:31.533 --> 00:52:32.575]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.575 --> 00:52:33.736]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.736 --> 00:52:34.638]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.638 --> 00:52:35.519]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:38.043]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.043 --> 00:52:41.829]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.909 --> 00:52:46.873]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.873 --> 00:52:48.375]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:49.456]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.456 --> 00:52:55.901]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:01.190]  Attention!
[00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:06.194]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[00:53:06.194 --> 00:53:11.879]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[00:53:11.879 --> 00:53:19.045]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[00:53:19.045 --> 00:53:27.812]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[00:53:28.993 --> 00:53:32.134]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[00:53:32.134 --> 00:53:38.976]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[00:53:38.976 --> 00:53:47.758]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[00:53:47.918 --> 00:53:52.580]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:52.640]  800-902-6969.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:52.760]  800-902-6969.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:52.960]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.361]  Okay, continue in that I'm going to your phone calls and a ton of other news.
[00:53:55.361 --> 00:53:57.061]  I haven't even gotten through two stacks yet here.
[00:54:10.017 --> 00:54:16.563]  So they come out and they say, the government's new right, track your every move with GPS without asking you.
[00:54:16.563 --> 00:54:19.887]  That was designed into the phones by law in 96.
[00:54:19.887 --> 00:54:24.251]  Now they're just telling the slaves 14 years later.
[00:54:24.251 --> 00:54:27.214]  Fourth Amendment violating mobile x-ray scanners hit the streets.
[00:54:27.214 --> 00:54:29.816]  Well my issue is the health situation.
[00:54:29.816 --> 00:54:33.400]  And here it is, full body scanning technology deployed in street roving vans.
[00:54:36.411 --> 00:54:37.091]  Here's another one.
[00:54:37.091 --> 00:54:39.672]  Pre-crime reaches number one Google trend spot.
[00:54:39.672 --> 00:54:41.893]  Good job doing that yesterday, folks.
[00:54:41.893 --> 00:54:45.754]  And our story dealing with it is still linked on the Drudge Report.
[00:54:45.754 --> 00:54:52.196]  Megalomaniacs push for Orwellian safe city controlled by internet where you must retina scan to buy and sell.
[00:54:52.196 --> 00:54:54.036]  They're testing it out in a Mexican city.
[00:54:54.036 --> 00:54:57.397]  And they're also testing it in a European city.
[00:54:57.397 --> 00:54:59.698]  And the Pentagon says they want it for the U.S.
[00:54:59.698 --> 00:55:02.139]  where everything you do is tracked and traced and controlled.
[00:55:03.356 --> 00:55:09.318]  Following an epic lawsuit by the Electronic Privacy Group, U.S.
[00:55:09.318 --> 00:55:14.359]  Senators raised questions about retention of body scanner images.
[00:55:14.359 --> 00:55:21.802]  And here's the article that went mega viral yesterday, pre-crime technology to be used in Washington, D.C., PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:21.802 --> 00:55:25.343]  Here's ABC News, software predicts criminal behavior, no it doesn't.
[00:55:25.343 --> 00:55:31.524]  It took us decades to get the fake lie detector test thrown out that put hundreds of thousands of innocent people in prison.
[00:55:31.524 --> 00:55:32.925]  Now they're up with new quackery.
[00:55:35.259 --> 00:55:36.380]  And it just continues.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:45.547]  And then we have the report of prisons and jails getting high-powered microwave guns that they're not allowed to use on firing enemies against the American people.
[00:55:45.547 --> 00:55:48.910]  Remember six, seven years ago, I said it'd be used domestically?
[00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:52.072]  And now they roll these out at tea party events with the sound cannons?
[00:55:52.072 --> 00:55:53.653]  You are the enemy.
[00:55:53.653 --> 00:55:57.896]  And the only jobs are gonna be being in prison or being an enforcer for this.
[00:55:57.896 --> 00:56:01.439]  And as an enforcer, they tell you, go ahead and breathe that dust, Bob.
[00:56:01.439 --> 00:56:03.160]  It's good for you at World Trade Center.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.802]  Go ahead and clean up that Gulf spill.
[00:56:06.082 --> 00:56:06.923]  You're collapsing.
[00:56:06.923 --> 00:56:08.624]  You don't need a respirator.
[00:56:08.624 --> 00:56:09.224]  It's healthy.
[00:56:09.224 --> 00:56:13.366]  Corexit's good for you.
[00:56:13.366 --> 00:56:15.027]  See, that's the big issue.
[00:56:15.027 --> 00:56:18.989]  They're just coming out in plain view and going, DU's good for you.
[00:56:18.989 --> 00:56:21.030]  Radiation's good for you.
[00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:23.151]  Besphenol A's good for you.
[00:56:23.151 --> 00:56:24.312]  Fluoride's good for you.
[00:56:24.312 --> 00:56:26.273]  We're going to put lithium in your water.
[00:56:26.273 --> 00:56:27.293]  It's good for you.
[00:56:27.293 --> 00:56:29.875]  Gardasil kills a lot of people, but it's good for you.
[00:56:31.045 --> 00:56:35.068]  H1N1, tenfold increase in convulsions, brain damage, good for you!
[00:56:35.068 --> 00:56:38.230]  It's all admitted, but it's good for you!
[00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:41.472]  They think you're so stupid, you're going to go along with this.
[00:56:41.472 --> 00:56:43.354]  Well, are you?
[00:56:43.354 --> 00:56:45.055]  Are you going to go along with it?
[00:56:45.055 --> 00:56:48.437]  Are you going to put up with it?
[00:56:48.437 --> 00:56:52.220]  And then I've got these reports.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.401]  Here.
[00:56:54.401 --> 00:56:57.523]  And I'll cover this after I take some phone calls.
[00:56:57.523 --> 00:56:59.845]  I'll cover it coming up at the next bottom of the hour.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:13.824]  They're turning public schools everywhere into full Army recruitment centers, Pentagon recruitment centers, and telling the kids on record, you'll be arrested if you don't sign papers to join the military, including kindergarten.
[00:57:13.824 --> 00:57:16.604]  That is Anchorage Daily News.
[00:57:16.604 --> 00:57:19.745]  Soldiers deployed to Anchorage schools to lend a hand.
[00:57:19.745 --> 00:57:24.447]  About 180 troops will spend time in classrooms.
[00:57:24.447 --> 00:57:27.047]  And it says, training them to have a military presence.
[00:57:27.047 --> 00:57:28.928]  Remember what happened in
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:35.404]  Florida in 1998, Hobbs Middle School.
[00:57:35.404 --> 00:57:43.910]  It was in the Pensacola newspaper.
[00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:45.091]  I had the reporter on.
[00:57:45.091 --> 00:57:46.072]  The reporter was there.
[00:57:46.892 --> 00:57:49.634]  You can read the articles, they're archived at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:49.634 --> 00:57:51.015]  Nobody ever believes this until you see it.
[00:57:51.015 --> 00:57:54.198]  We've now caught them all over the country doing it since then.
[00:57:54.198 --> 00:57:57.640]  The Marines bust in, take over the school, point M-16s at them.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.582]  The children begin defecating and urinating on themselves.
[00:58:00.582 --> 00:58:04.605]  This has happened nationwide now, and they say, this is martial law.
[00:58:04.605 --> 00:58:07.408]  Bill Clinton wants you to know what martial law is like.
[00:58:07.408 --> 00:58:08.909]  These are quotes from the newspaper.
[00:58:09.816 --> 00:58:15.038]  They have other drills where troops show up with SWAT teams and announce we're homeschoolers here to kill you.
[00:58:15.038 --> 00:58:17.278]  To teach the kids to hate homeschoolers.
[00:58:17.278 --> 00:58:20.259]  You've seen those cases in Michigan, made it in the AP.
[00:58:20.259 --> 00:58:24.080]  This is hardcore re-education camp brainwashing.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:33.103]  And then they've been caught tricking the kids to sign commitment forms which aren't even legal until they're 18 and then lying to them and saying you'll go to jail if you don't join the military.
[00:58:33.809 --> 00:58:37.694]  It's full spectrum, total tyranny, taking over our entire society.
[00:58:37.694 --> 00:58:38.555]  It's a black op.
[00:58:38.555 --> 00:58:42.000]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.525]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.525 --> 00:58:47.367]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.202 --> 00:58:55.185]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:58:55.185 --> 00:58:56.166]  What have we got?
[00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:58.607]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:58:58.607 --> 00:58:59.608]  A republic.
[00:58:59.608 --> 00:59:02.269]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:59:02.269 --> 00:59:04.531]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:59:04.531 --> 00:59:06.552]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:59:06.552 --> 00:59:08.233]  So they think they own our land?
[00:59:08.233 --> 00:59:09.554]  They think they own our water?
[00:59:09.554 --> 00:59:10.154]  Children?
[00:59:10.154 --> 00:59:11.295]  Our education?
[00:59:11.295 --> 00:59:12.116]  Our money?
[00:59:12.116 --> 00:59:15.758]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:59:16.138 --> 00:59:21.101]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:59:21.101 --> 00:59:22.122]  We have the facts.
[00:59:22.122 --> 00:59:23.282]  We have the Constitution.
[00:59:23.282 --> 00:59:24.183]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:59:24.183 --> 00:59:25.083]  We have common law.
[00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:27.605]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:31.387]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:59:31.527 --> 00:59:36.429]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:59:36.429 --> 00:59:37.929]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:59:37.929 --> 00:59:39.030]  Don't tread on me.

[00:59:53.175 --> 00:59:55.556]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.556 --> 00:59:58.337]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:10.046]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:11.627]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.627 --> 01:00:13.188]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.188 --> 01:00:17.371]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.371 --> 01:00:21.414]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:28.754]  Okay, I want to talk to Jim, Steve, Tim, Rashid, Jay, and many others.
[01:00:28.754 --> 01:00:39.157]  I've got a bunch of news on the economy, on public schools, including kindergarten being taken over by full Pentagon brainwashing, taking the children away from their parents psychologically.
[01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:41.837]  They can't CPS them all.
[01:00:41.837 --> 01:00:43.038]  They're imploding the states.
[01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:51.300]  All that will be left is the Pentagon and social workers, the threat fusion centers, total Pentagon takeover.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.180]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:53.434 --> 01:00:57.055]  Hey Alex, I called you about the Floor Nation and the water.
[01:00:57.055 --> 01:00:59.075]  My father retired for the county water here in St.
[01:00:59.075 --> 01:00:59.215]  Louis.
[01:00:59.215 --> 01:01:01.896]  I also had talked to you prior with Craig Roberts about Yaman, and now you're
[01:01:23.257 --> 01:01:25.118]  Back to Yamin again.
[01:01:25.118 --> 01:01:28.799]  Yamin's situation has not changed.
[01:01:28.799 --> 01:01:34.242]  Without going into great detail, I really appreciate
[01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:41.230]  What you and your staff have been doing, but I think you're being distracted to a certain degree.
[01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:46.412]  Sir, sir, you called a few months ago and said that you worked for a long time in Yemen.
[01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:50.433]  All I did was read a Wall Street Journal headline, U.S.
[01:01:50.433 --> 01:01:56.374]  Waves Expanding Strikes in Yemen, and that was all I read was the headline that they're expanding these wars.
[01:01:56.374 --> 01:01:58.054]  You're saying I'm being steered wrong.
[01:01:58.054 --> 01:02:00.075]  I'm reading what the State Department and Pentagon said.
[01:02:01.656 --> 01:02:03.037]  I never said I work for Yemen.
[01:02:03.037 --> 01:02:03.977]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:02:03.977 --> 01:02:04.137]  Good.
[01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:04.497]  Two points.
[01:02:21.847 --> 01:02:31.951]  All this stuff that you've been talking about regarding the insidious attack on the people, okay, of this country, all the countries that are being divided... Well, it's not just the attack.
[01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:33.191]  It's not just the attack.
[01:02:33.191 --> 01:02:35.512]  They're doing it in the open now.
[01:02:35.512 --> 01:02:44.196]  We're going to drive by and blast your house with incredibly high-powered x-rays that are off the charts compared to a chest x-ray, and we're just going to do it.
[01:02:44.196 --> 01:02:47.297]  And the government's got 500 of them, and they're already driving around with them.
[01:02:48.024 --> 01:02:50.886]  Alex, let me just tell you real quick, okay?
[01:02:50.886 --> 01:02:54.249]  This had its origin when we won the war in Germany.
[01:02:54.249 --> 01:03:00.614]  They were working on all this stuff, okay, that we perfected because we absorbed those people, okay?
[01:03:00.614 --> 01:03:03.597]  Their science, their scientists, all the stuff they were working on.
[01:03:03.977 --> 01:03:07.959]  You're talking about the rat line, but it's more than that.
[01:03:07.959 --> 01:03:14.101]  Eugenics and this worldview of total tyranny came from England and the U.S., Hitler picked up on it, they developed it further, then we merged.
[01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:14.621]  It was like
[01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:35.731]  Two people that are peas in a pod getting back together, really.
[01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:37.532]  I want to make a second point real quick.
[01:03:37.532 --> 01:03:50.879]  So what it is, is what you said earlier about the preachers, you know, and these people go and listen to the preachers and they're going to tell them to get rid of your guns and all this stuff that's going to end them up in camps, right?
[01:03:50.879 --> 01:03:53.520]  Well, I've got to say this, and it's a biblical thing.
[01:03:54.119 --> 01:03:58.723]  Um, it's even in the Bible regarding the Laodiceans.
[01:03:58.723 --> 01:03:59.984]  You know what I'm talking about?
[01:03:59.984 --> 01:04:01.125]  That name, Laodiceans?
[01:04:03.118 --> 01:04:03.879]  That's him, Bob.
[01:04:03.879 --> 01:04:04.699]  You can actually see it.
[01:04:04.699 --> 01:04:05.340]  I understand.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.441]  Go ahead, tell us what it is.
[01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:08.462]  Well, the whole point goes to this.
[01:04:08.462 --> 01:04:11.625]  Right now, there's a marriage and what's going on in Europe.
[01:04:11.625 --> 01:04:19.491]  And just like Bernanke did with the secret numbers so they can just print money, well, Germany's going to bail out all these other people, okay?
[01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:27.157]  And the thing that's scary to me is this guy, his name is Baron Karl Theodore Gutenberg.
[01:04:27.157 --> 01:04:27.758]  You ever heard of him?
[01:04:28.362 --> 01:04:28.602]  Go ahead.
[01:04:28.602 --> 01:04:30.003]  He's out of the fifth, mister.
[01:04:30.003 --> 01:04:30.684]  Okay?
[01:04:30.684 --> 01:04:35.047]  And now they, that country last year made a union with the Vatican.
[01:04:35.047 --> 01:04:43.413]  So, I'm reading into, I may be wrong, but there's something so insidious that goes back several thousand... Well, no, no.
[01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:50.238]  I mean, I mean, the Vatican basically helped found the EU and is at the heart of this whole world government system.
[01:04:50.238 --> 01:04:52.079]  All these major power groups are.
[01:04:52.079 --> 01:04:53.460]  They're all on a team.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.761]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:54.761 --> 01:04:56.022]  More calls, a ton of news.
[01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:56.582]  Straight ahead.
[01:04:56.582 --> 01:04:57.043]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.182 --> 01:05:04.725]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.725 --> 01:05:05.646]  Number 1.
[01:05:05.646 --> 01:05:09.069]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.929]  Number 2.
[01:05:09.929 --> 01:05:14.813]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.813 --> 01:05:15.573]  It's true.
[01:05:15.573 --> 01:05:20.437]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.437 --> 01:05:21.258]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.258 --> 01:05:24.840]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.563]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.743 --> 01:05:29.544]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.544 --> 01:05:32.306]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.306 --> 01:05:35.990]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.771]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.771 --> 01:05:40.934]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.934 --> 01:05:45.679]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:52.537]  Thank you!
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.662]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:07:02.662 --> 01:07:06.464]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:07:06.464 --> 01:07:09.345]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:07:09.345 --> 01:07:14.268]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:14.708 --> 01:07:20.653]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:07:20.653 --> 01:07:26.337]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:07:26.337 --> 01:07:30.861]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:07:30.861 --> 01:07:39.367]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:07:39.367 --> 01:07:41.569]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:43.551]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:43.931 --> 01:07:51.754]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:51.754 --> 01:08:00.277]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:07.259]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[01:08:07.259 --> 01:08:10.240]  Some men you just can't reach.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:16.543]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[01:08:16.543 --> 01:08:17.724]  Well, he is.
[01:08:17.724 --> 01:08:26.790]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:29.392]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:29.392 --> 01:08:31.793]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:31.793 --> 01:08:35.736]  Alright, I'm gonna get to your calls.
[01:08:35.736 --> 01:08:37.097]  I got a bunch of other news coming up.
[01:08:37.097 --> 01:08:38.898]  Let me get some of that news now.
[01:08:42.677 --> 01:08:45.038]  Carver's Bay enlists 9th grade.
[01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:47.300]  This is in South Carolina.
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:52.302]  Entire 9th grade class forced to sign up for Junior ROTC.
[01:08:53.308 --> 01:09:01.475]  Then, and this happened in Houston, Denver, it's happened over and over again, you saw it on the news, became big scandals and they promoted the recruiters that did this.
[01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:08.422]  They'd call them up at home and the kids' parents would record them going, you were part of Junior ROTC!
[01:09:08.422 --> 01:09:10.183]  That means you're signed up.
[01:09:10.183 --> 01:09:11.664]  You're now graduating.
[01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:13.066]  You will be arrested.
[01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.167]  Do you understand?
[01:09:14.167 --> 01:09:17.470]  Boy, if you don't get over here now,
[01:09:18.786 --> 01:09:20.248]  And it was all color of law.
[01:09:20.248 --> 01:09:21.529]  It wasn't true.
[01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:24.072]  They trick them into signing, but it's not legal until they're 18.
[01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:26.975]  Then they try to make them re-sign.
[01:09:26.975 --> 01:09:29.218]  I will arrest you!
[01:09:29.218 --> 01:09:35.244]  It's a press gang, like the British used to go into towns and grab young people and throw them onto ships and use them as slave labor.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:39.102]  And it's all back, and it's totally immoral and evil.
[01:09:39.102 --> 01:09:41.464]  But hey, you gotta get them while they're young, huh?
[01:09:41.464 --> 01:09:42.805]  This is coming up.
[01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:44.266]  This is out of the Anchorage Daily News.
[01:09:44.266 --> 01:09:45.927]  We have a key breakdown article.
[01:09:45.927 --> 01:09:48.710]  Creeping militarism invades an Alaska school.
[01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:51.972]  At Infowars.com, here's the Anchorage Daily News.
[01:09:51.972 --> 01:09:56.916]  Soldiers deployed to Anchorage schools to lend a hand.
[01:09:56.916 --> 01:10:02.240]  180 troops will spend time with the kindergartners right up through 12th grade.
[01:10:04.706 --> 01:10:10.388]  180, just in this one school district, to teach them about a military presence.
[01:10:10.388 --> 01:10:15.890]  And this is acclimating them, and they dress them up in uniforms and everything, and train them, this is your family.
[01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:20.712]  First the state pays to not have women have husbands in the home.
[01:10:20.712 --> 01:10:23.673]  Society breaks down, and now the army is your daddy.
[01:10:23.673 --> 01:10:25.694]  It's going to be your gang leader.
[01:10:25.694 --> 01:10:29.615]  You think some gang can go recruit kids that don't have daddies?
[01:10:29.615 --> 01:10:30.755]  Well, this is the state.
[01:10:30.755 --> 01:10:32.316]  This is the end of the family.
[01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:34.225]  It's all coming up.
[01:10:34.225 --> 01:10:39.987]  Also, cutbacks force police to curtail some calls, curtail calls for some crimes.
[01:10:39.987 --> 01:10:45.109]  All over the country, half the police, two-thirds of the police, 25% of the police.
[01:10:45.109 --> 01:10:46.630]  We're not going to respond to armed robbery.
[01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:48.330]  We're not going to respond to car theft.
[01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:51.832]  But we're going to go out and write you tickets and raise money.
[01:10:51.832 --> 01:10:56.194]  This is, everything's collapsing at the state level as taxes go up.
[01:10:56.194 --> 01:11:01.876]  I was in a convenience store this morning and saw both papers, Dallas and Austin, talking about tax increases.
[01:11:03.558 --> 01:11:05.459]  But the army gets more money.
[01:11:05.459 --> 01:11:12.382]  It's going to be in your local town at DUI checkpoints and at the county fair, helping the police and with your children.
[01:11:12.382 --> 01:11:18.184]  And they're going to have x-ray machines searching your cars.
[01:11:18.184 --> 01:11:19.885]  This is the insanity.
[01:11:19.885 --> 01:11:24.487]  Continuing with financial news, Morgan Stanley says government defaults inevitable.
[01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:28.863]  Stock market, all of this stuff.
[01:11:28.863 --> 01:11:29.904]  It's insane, folks.
[01:11:29.904 --> 01:11:31.686]  They're destroying our economy by design.
[01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:41.156]  That's why I wanted to bring Steve Schenck of efoodsdirect.com up for the rest of this segment, because they have the best, high-quality, fresh, storable foods at the best prices anywhere.
[01:11:41.156 --> 01:11:43.898]  You heard Catherine Austin Fitch, former head of HUD on yesterday.
[01:11:44.944 --> 01:11:49.526]  Saying you gotta get storable food, you gotta start a garden, they're gonna implode society.
[01:11:49.526 --> 01:11:52.107]  She worked for them, this is their plan.
[01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:58.649]  And yes, they're a great sponsor and they helped fund this show, but I got them as a sponsor because I bought a lot of storable food and it was crud.
[01:11:58.649 --> 01:12:01.070]  Their food was high quality.
[01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:03.111]  And so you need to get it.
[01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:08.455]  But Steve also is one of the biggest producers and manufacturers of storable food, so he understands.
[01:12:08.455 --> 01:12:13.879]  And now the news is reporting prices going up, dollar in trouble, depression on the horizon.
[01:12:13.879 --> 01:12:17.762]  With all of these reasons, you need to get storable food that lasts more than 10 years.
[01:12:17.762 --> 01:12:20.764]  Steve, tell folks about your great food line.
[01:12:20.764 --> 01:12:23.807]  Well, Alex, what we've run into, is my sound okay for you?
[01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:25.108]  Yes, sir!
[01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:28.050]  Okay, what we've run into is for the last two and a half years,
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:42.935]  Suppliers have been just jacking prices up because they've had to and we've held it off and at this point we can't do it anymore with this big Russian thing with the wheat drought and everything and they've stopped exporting wheat.
[01:12:42.935 --> 01:12:43.636]  All exports!
[01:12:45.618 --> 01:12:48.119]  That's come right down the line.
[01:12:48.119 --> 01:12:52.541]  And now they're doing the same thing that you and I talked about before.
[01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:57.224]  Big Salmonella scare with regard to eggs.
[01:12:57.224 --> 01:13:01.386]  Half a billion eggs recalled in three states.
[01:13:01.386 --> 01:13:04.287]  We've got E. coli.
[01:13:04.287 --> 01:13:07.029]  A million pounds of ground beef again.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:20.853]  Right as they introduce and are trying to pass the bill, where if you read it, they could potentially ban having a farm without a government license, the Animal ID, Premises ID expanding.
[01:13:20.853 --> 01:13:22.735]  I mean, they are really staging this.
[01:13:22.735 --> 01:13:23.516]  The evidence is clear.
[01:13:24.056 --> 01:13:36.744]  Oh absolutely, and what they're going to do is, you can not only not have a farm, but you can't trade any homegrown stuff with each other, or give it away, or do anything with it.
[01:13:36.744 --> 01:13:48.370]  Total food control... And they won't send inspectors, this is also in the news, to the big factories, but they're harassing people selling pumpkins, and grapes, and watermelons, and eggs, and cheese, and milk.
[01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:50.572]  They're SWAT teaming people nationwide.
[01:13:51.371 --> 01:13:54.152]  And this is the only clean food you can get.
[01:13:54.152 --> 01:14:02.877]  We're really concerned about that because what's happened is the prices from our suppliers are just absolutely skyrocketing.
[01:14:02.877 --> 01:14:09.140]  And what we did when we saw this happen, we're not going to be able to hold off price increases.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.921]  We're going to have to have a huge price increase.
[01:14:11.921 --> 01:14:13.602]  We can't do a stinking thing about it.
[01:14:13.602 --> 01:14:19.885]  We've held it off for two and a half years, Alex, and it's been going downhill in terms of our margins and everything since.
[01:14:20.585 --> 01:14:33.580]  But what we did was we put together some assets and got in touch with our suppliers and we made a huge buy at the existing prices.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:40.869]  And rather than just raise the price when we have to and take in the extra margin, we're going to sell all of this out.
[01:14:41.589 --> 01:14:48.291]  And that we've gone back to something that everybody loved and was just a tremendous possibility for folks.
[01:14:48.291 --> 01:14:59.895]  While we have this supply that we just ordered in there and processing right now available, while it's still lasting, we're going to go back to the buy three, get one free on the selected items.
[01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:10.058]  So, if folks want to get stocked up for the last chance on the pricing that we've had right now, and I'm telling you, this isn't any playing games.
[01:15:11.378 --> 01:15:17.325]  We've been struggling with this, Alex, for the last month and a half, trying to figure out how to avoid it.
[01:15:17.325 --> 01:15:19.166]  We just can't.
[01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:32.380]  If we don't increase the prices, we can't even afford to buy from our suppliers the quality of products that we've been able to put together so that people can have safe and clean food.
[01:15:34.082 --> 01:15:37.023]  What we're doing right now is we're announcing this.
[01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:41.084]  We're going to send out emails to people that we have email addresses for.
[01:15:41.084 --> 01:15:52.548]  But the reason that we scheduled this interview and discussion with you is so that you can get out to your listeners the fact that we are going to have a deadly serious price increase.
[01:15:52.548 --> 01:16:02.652]  But what we've done is we've put in enough stock so that we should be able to supply quite a few folks with this product.
[01:16:03.423 --> 01:16:06.286]  At buy three, get one free on the selected items.
[01:16:06.286 --> 01:16:14.393]  So get to the website, efoodsdirect.com, and you'll see a little notice up there.
[01:16:14.393 --> 01:16:29.487]  And also, if you work with Alex's show, get on efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, and either way, it'll get you to this landing page that'll tell you exactly what's going on.
[01:16:30.473 --> 01:16:37.017]  So, Alex, this is just absolutely absurd what's happening with the prices on food right now.
[01:16:37.017 --> 01:16:37.937]  And you're right.
[01:16:37.937 --> 01:16:39.458]  They're staging this whole thing.
[01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:43.400]  The egg prices went up 38% as a result of that mess.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:49.163]  Veggie prices have gone up like 49%.
[01:16:49.163 --> 01:16:54.246]  Vegetables, Alex, 49% at the wholesale level.
[01:16:54.246 --> 01:16:55.727]  And it's just absolutely insane.
[01:16:56.792 --> 01:17:08.460]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt they bring in this draconian bill that's part of Codex Alimentarius, and the UN says they'll use food as a weapon, and they're harassing all the little people while leaving the big, corrupt Tysons and others alone.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:15.565]  It's like they leave BP alone, having more violations than all the oil companies combined every year, just in the Houston refining area alone.
[01:17:15.565 --> 01:17:17.146]  It's the same thing on this issue.
[01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:30.974]  And my reason to have storable food is with the wars and the deepening depression, even if there's a 10% chance this is going to happen, you've got to have storable food to be self-sufficient or you're under government control.
[01:17:30.974 --> 01:17:36.137]  And unfortunately, I've said it's more than a 70% chance that we're going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:17:36.137 --> 01:17:38.178]  And I've got stacks of news.
[01:17:38.178 --> 01:17:38.839]  U.S.
[01:17:38.839 --> 01:17:43.261]  new home sales sinks to lowest pace in history on record.
[01:17:43.261 --> 01:17:46.143]  Durable goods orders rose far less than expected.
[01:17:47.085 --> 01:17:49.405]  It continues with headlines here.
[01:17:49.405 --> 01:17:51.886]  Economy caught in depression, not recession.
[01:17:51.886 --> 01:17:53.026]  CNBC.
[01:17:53.026 --> 01:17:54.687]  I mean, we know this is by design.
[01:17:54.687 --> 01:17:59.888]  I read their own documents, so I say firearms, food, move to the country if you can.
[01:17:59.888 --> 01:18:01.868]  Get out of their control grid cities.
[01:18:01.868 --> 01:18:03.248]  Warn everyone you know.
[01:18:03.248 --> 01:18:05.229]  They mean business.
[01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:09.590]  And you had 90% of people being self-sufficient in the Great Depression over 10 years.
[01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:10.930]  7 million starving to death.
[01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:14.731]  Now 90% are urban, not rural, and aren't self-sufficient.
[01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:16.131]  It's completely flipped.
[01:18:16.131 --> 01:18:16.491]  Folks,
[01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:18.892]  You've got to get prepared.
[01:18:18.892 --> 01:18:20.332]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:18:20.332 --> 01:18:22.593]  We'll also put it back up on the TV screen there.
[01:18:22.593 --> 01:18:24.854]  Your website, a bunch of different great food lines.
[01:18:24.854 --> 01:18:26.895]  This is the best food, the best prices.
[01:18:26.895 --> 01:18:29.096]  Do the buy three, get one free.
[01:18:29.096 --> 01:18:34.758]  Now folks, before it runs out, a bunch of different great food lines, non-GMO, non-hybrid, 800-409-5633.
[01:18:38.119 --> 01:18:46.803]  800-409-5633, or E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[01:18:46.803 --> 01:18:53.346]  We're preparing for the worst, hoping for the best, and unfortunately everything we've talked about is coming true.
[01:18:53.346 --> 01:18:55.167]  Every day I wish I was wrong.
[01:18:55.167 --> 01:18:58.529]  Every day I wish I wasn't actually reading globalist documents, but
[01:18:59.329 --> 01:19:07.737]  It is such a good feeling to have food that lasts like 15 years in air conditioning, 10 years guaranteed in your garage, because I don't have room, like at my house, in my attic.
[01:19:07.737 --> 01:19:10.680]  You need to call them, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:17.707]  Steve, Shank, I want to thank you for coming on, and how long can you run this buy three, get one free?
[01:19:17.707 --> 01:19:23.193]  Well, we're going to run it as long as we have supplies, but one of the things I suggest
[01:19:24.143 --> 01:19:28.067]  Uh, we're going to, we're trying to do it at least four weeks.
[01:19:28.067 --> 01:19:34.412]  Uh, one of the things that I would suggest to folks is that everybody kind of waits till the last minute.
[01:19:34.412 --> 01:19:43.119]  And so that's going to run into some real problems because at the rate that we have experienced orders before when we did this.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:44.801]  Not even with the price increase.
[01:19:44.801 --> 01:19:45.221]  We'll run out.
[01:19:45.221 --> 01:19:45.281]  800-409-5633.
[01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:45.521]  800-409-5633.
[01:19:45.521 --> 01:19:46.162]  God bless you, Steve.
[01:19:46.162 --> 01:19:46.542]  Take care, Alex.

[01:21:07.952 --> 01:21:11.675]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:21:19.482 --> 01:21:19.682]  I think?

[01:23:00.014 --> 01:23:03.016]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:23:03.016 --> 01:23:05.097]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.

[01:24:21.495 --> 01:24:22.576]  Alright, I'm gonna take calls.
[01:24:23.624 --> 01:24:24.805]  The rest of the hour.
[01:24:24.805 --> 01:24:31.610]  And then the entire last hour, I'm taking calls and blitzing through all of this amazing news.
[01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:36.433]  It's so incredible how it's now all out in the open, but they're spinning it like it's good.
[01:24:36.433 --> 01:24:40.236]  Steve in Texas had questions, then Tim, Rashid, Don, Jake, and others.
[01:24:40.236 --> 01:24:41.076]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:41.657]  Thanks for holding.
[01:24:42.383 --> 01:24:44.526]  Hey Alex, yeah, um, it's just coming to mind.
[01:24:44.526 --> 01:24:52.957]  All this time that you've been talking about, all this stuff, all this time, it feels like now, just this recently, we're actually in the belly of the dragon already.
[01:24:52.957 --> 01:24:55.100]  It's like, this is it.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:58.404]  Yeah, no, no, they're driving around with 500 trucks radiating our houses.
[01:24:58.824 --> 01:25:05.728]  Well, I've already mailed off a bunch of stuff, but I wanted to ask you if you've gotten any recent documentaries, you know, what are the documentaries?
[01:25:27.241 --> 01:25:27.801]  We're good.
[01:25:35.492 --> 01:25:37.693]  We don't have any time left.
[01:25:37.693 --> 01:25:38.233]  You said it.
[01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:41.434]  We're in the belly of the beast now, and it's digesting us.
[01:25:41.434 --> 01:25:55.097]  We're in the dragon's belly, and we've got the sword of truth on our side, and the acid's burning through our skin collectively, and we've got to pull out the dagger, hold our breath, and just cut our way out of this sucker.
[01:25:55.097 --> 01:25:57.438]  But we've got to admit we're in the dragon's belly.
[01:25:58.138 --> 01:26:01.081]  And most Christians are like, it's the end of the world.
[01:26:01.081 --> 01:26:02.222]  Jesus is coming.
[01:26:02.222 --> 01:26:06.045]  Well, regardless, you've got to go out and warn people and say no.
[01:26:06.045 --> 01:26:13.232]  They're coming out with the body scanning and the driver's license that are biometric and all the control and the poison in the food.
[01:26:13.232 --> 01:26:14.273]  I mean, it's here.
[01:26:14.273 --> 01:26:18.597]  And if your church isn't talking about it, you are in a government-controlled whorehouse.
[01:26:18.597 --> 01:26:20.519]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:20.519 --> 01:26:21.840]  Let's talk to Tim in Michigan.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.601]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:26:23.632 --> 01:26:25.073]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:26:25.073 --> 01:26:26.054]  Hey, buddy.
[01:26:26.054 --> 01:26:26.955]  How you doing, man?
[01:26:26.955 --> 01:26:27.515]  Good.
[01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:28.255]  Been a little while.
[01:26:28.255 --> 01:26:31.958]  Me and my girlfriend, well, I'd like to thank you.
[01:26:31.958 --> 01:26:41.726]  You know, I didn't think I would set off such a giant light bulb in your head when I started talking about the trending and how you've been putting out the search term
[01:26:42.566 --> 01:26:52.088]  That's right, you called about two months ago and said you ought to put out search terms, and now we've done it 18 for 18.
[01:26:52.088 --> 01:26:55.409]  Our search term pre-crime yesterday was numero uno.
[01:26:55.409 --> 01:26:57.009]  They've always been number one.
[01:26:57.009 --> 01:27:07.112]  And hey, I just wanted to thank you because, and I also talked to you about, you know, how this was taking an emotional kind of a lie out of me emotionally.
[01:27:07.112 --> 01:27:08.532]  You know, I'm retired, I'm almost 50.
[01:27:09.646 --> 01:27:15.462]  And I'm on disability, and I have a lot of time on my hands, and I'm glad I took the time.
[01:27:15.462 --> 01:27:17.387]  I can sum this all up in five words.
[01:27:17.836 --> 01:27:20.757]  Brave New World, Science Dictatorship.
[01:27:20.757 --> 01:27:22.877]  That is what is going on.
[01:27:22.877 --> 01:27:29.719]  The guy that wrote Brave New World was part of a five-family secret breeding program to create a superhuman.
[01:27:29.719 --> 01:27:32.120]  That's now declassified.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:42.143]  Aldous Huxley, his brother Julian Huxley, ran the UN Eugenics UNESCO program, and before he died he gave a speech and said, it's all real, we're gonna totally kill your butt.
[01:27:42.403 --> 01:27:43.483]  Ha ha ha!
[01:27:43.483 --> 01:27:44.984]  And there's nothing you're going to do.
[01:27:44.984 --> 01:27:46.624]  He said you're going to love your servitude.
[01:27:46.624 --> 01:27:48.245]  You're going to love your death.
[01:27:48.245 --> 01:27:50.585]  We're going to break up the family.
[01:27:50.585 --> 01:27:53.746]  That's just a means to the end and we're going to kill you.
[01:27:53.746 --> 01:27:57.307]  And we're going to kill you publicly and you're going to love it!
[01:27:57.307 --> 01:27:57.887]  Right.
[01:27:57.887 --> 01:28:06.869]  And what I was talking about, after having all this information, I watched Endgame again yesterday, me and my girlfriend, and I made her listen to that speech with me.
[01:28:06.869 --> 01:28:09.430]  And it absolutely is pure evil.
[01:28:09.895 --> 01:28:11.476]  There's no other way to describe it.
[01:28:11.476 --> 01:28:12.897]  It is pure evil.
[01:28:12.897 --> 01:28:15.058]  These people have lost their minds.
[01:28:15.058 --> 01:28:16.219]  They tried their air-breathing.
[01:28:16.219 --> 01:28:17.600]  What, four generations it took?
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.741]  Then they start having mongoloid children.
[01:28:19.741 --> 01:28:20.241]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:20.241 --> 01:28:22.622]  You're talking about the five families.
[01:28:22.622 --> 01:28:26.625]  The Wedgwoods, the Huxleys, the Darwins, the Galtans, and there was one other.
[01:28:26.625 --> 01:28:29.046]  And they all interbred to create the superhuman starting in 1855.
[01:28:29.046 --> 01:28:29.386]  And by the 20s,
[01:28:32.208 --> 01:28:34.629]  Over 90% of the children died at birth.
[01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:37.371]  Almost all the others were completely mentally retarded.
[01:28:37.371 --> 01:28:42.433]  But a few were 200 IQ super geniuses, but were very weird.
[01:28:42.433 --> 01:28:47.896]  I mean, Huxley was like, you know, an old glassy eyed and weird, but he was really smart.
[01:28:47.896 --> 01:28:49.796]  So was his brother.
[01:28:49.796 --> 01:28:53.738]  And they just took the smartest people in England and super bred them.
[01:28:53.738 --> 01:28:54.999]  And it's incredible.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.421]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking about.
[01:28:58.421 --> 01:28:59.981]  And I just wanted to share this with you, too.
[01:28:59.981 --> 01:29:00.481]  I got a couple.
[01:29:00.481 --> 01:29:05.582]  I hope you let me get through this today, man, because I'm, like, hitting on all eight cylinders living in the Motor City here.
[01:29:05.582 --> 01:29:14.545]  Now, listen, they rolled out on Channel 4 News Local News here that they have something that will absolutely protect your child.
[01:29:14.545 --> 01:29:17.846]  It's the best thing in the world, and it has to do with satellites.
[01:29:17.846 --> 01:29:20.666]  So I run in the bedroom, and I tell my girlfriend, you got to come out and see this.
[01:29:20.666 --> 01:29:23.027]  They're going to talk about chipping the kids at birth.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.742]  So that they don't get kidnapped!
[01:29:25.742 --> 01:29:28.846]  And I asked my girlfriend, how many people you know that had their kids kidnapped?
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.541]  I said I'm almost 50.
[01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:35.802]  Most of the time it's the CPS that kidnaps them legally.
[01:29:35.802 --> 01:29:37.262]  Stay there, finish up your point.
[01:29:37.262 --> 01:29:43.784]  Then we're going to Rashid, Don in Hawaii, Jake and others.
[01:29:43.784 --> 01:29:44.124]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:44.124 --> 01:29:46.804]  You are in the belly of the old dragon.
[01:29:46.804 --> 01:29:48.265]  Are we going to cut our way out of this?
[01:29:48.265 --> 01:29:49.525]  Or be dissolved?
[01:29:49.525 --> 01:29:50.845]  Be digested?
[01:29:50.845 --> 01:29:52.246]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.246 --> 01:29:54.766]  The empire's on the run.

[01:31:04.153 --> 01:31:05.413]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.413 --> 01:31:09.355]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.355 --> 01:31:11.596]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:11.596 --> 01:31:17.459]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:31:17.459 --> 01:31:23.702]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.102 --> 01:31:30.065]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.065 --> 01:31:34.267]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.267 --> 01:31:38.570]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:44.513]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.513 --> 01:31:48.075]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.075 --> 01:31:50.056]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.056 --> 01:31:50.476]  It's here.

[01:31:59.861 --> 01:32:04.064]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:32:04.064 --> 01:32:10.489]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:32:10.489 --> 01:32:17.875]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:32:17.875 --> 01:32:22.738]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:32:31.385 --> 01:32:35.109]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:32:35.652 --> 01:32:42.416]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:32:42.416 --> 01:32:46.298]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:33:03.788 --> 01:33:10.048]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.525 --> 01:33:22.768]  Okay, we're gonna go back to Tim, but I just want to point out, you've slowly been acclimated, like the frog in the boiling pot.
[01:33:22.768 --> 01:33:27.269]  They turned it up slowly, and now we're in a full boiling pot here.
[01:33:27.269 --> 01:33:28.890]  And everybody's under attack.
[01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:36.612]  Bureaucrats, police, CIA, FBI, all the enforcers are under as much attack as we are.
[01:33:36.612 --> 01:33:40.873]  You're on our side, whether you make the conscious or spiritual decision.
[01:33:40.873 --> 01:33:41.854]  You are under attack.
[01:33:42.796 --> 01:33:47.738]  Coming up, mainstream news admitting the new global currency.
[01:33:47.738 --> 01:33:49.339]  I'm going to be covering that.
[01:33:49.339 --> 01:33:51.159]  I mean, it's here.
[01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:53.880]  And it gives total tyrants even more power.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.442]  They create the crisis, they offer the solution, even more power for themselves.
[01:33:59.993 --> 01:34:02.314]  It's so incredible what's happening.
[01:34:02.314 --> 01:34:10.015]  And when I talk about, metaphorically, running down the street, screaming, pulling our hair out, that would really probably actually wake people up.
[01:34:10.015 --> 01:34:14.256]  Opening the window, screaming, I'm as mad as you know what, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:34:14.256 --> 01:34:22.498]  Getting aggressive, speaking out, going and speaking at city council, going and speaking at county commissioners, going and signing up to speak at the state house in committee hearings.
[01:34:23.058 --> 01:34:34.162]  Calling talk radio, setting up blogs, doing your own radio show, getting my films, making copies of them, putting flyers up, saying no to the naked body scanners.
[01:34:34.162 --> 01:34:37.664]  We have got to point all this out.
[01:34:37.664 --> 01:34:46.707]  And I'm so buoyed by the fact that we've gotten countless calls and confirmations that literally everywhere people are now
[01:34:50.731 --> 01:34:57.540]  Calling Congress, and families are calling the military saying, why is it on the news that our troops grow the opium, but it's illegal in the U.S.?
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:59.462]  See, they think you're so stupid now.
[01:34:59.462 --> 01:35:00.483]  Yes, we grow the opium!
[01:35:01.243 --> 01:35:02.424]  Yes, we're radiating you.
[01:35:02.424 --> 01:35:04.986]  Yes, we naked body scan you and save the images.
[01:35:04.986 --> 01:35:06.587]  Yes, we've stolen trillions.
[01:35:06.587 --> 01:35:09.749]  Yes, the CIA's taking over your local school with the Pentagon.
[01:35:09.749 --> 01:35:14.132]  Yes, the Army's running checkpoints in Tennessee, even when the governor says don't do it.
[01:35:14.132 --> 01:35:17.955]  Yes, the kindergarten's being taken over by the Pentagon and brainwashing the kids.
[01:35:17.955 --> 01:35:22.638]  Yes, we've covertly taken over 50,000 plus preachers to have them train you to submit to tyranny.
[01:35:22.638 --> 01:35:23.999]  I mean, it's here!
[01:35:23.999 --> 01:35:24.960]  It's illegal!
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:25.601]  It's wrong!
[01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:29.796]  And I'm so angry that John McCain won by a healthy margin.
[01:35:29.796 --> 01:35:33.263]  All the polls showed it was a dead heat or he was going to lose by a few points.
[01:35:33.263 --> 01:35:35.527]  And he won by a large margin.
[01:35:35.527 --> 01:35:38.192]  I am very, very suspicious.
[01:35:41.596 --> 01:35:41.936]  Exactly.
[01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:43.518]  That's what they're trying to sell it as.
[01:35:43.518 --> 01:35:45.160]  They're rolling it out as an absolute
[01:36:05.723 --> 01:36:06.644]  I don't know.
[01:36:27.091 --> 01:36:29.014]  Okay, um, what night was that?
[01:36:29.014 --> 01:36:31.799]  Was that like, uh, Monday night?
[01:36:31.799 --> 01:36:32.881]  Monday night.
[01:36:32.881 --> 01:36:38.390]  Listen, the first thing they say in the newscast is normally the name of the piece.
[01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:39.252]  What was it called?
[01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:40.855]  Protect your children from kidnapping?
[01:36:41.673 --> 01:36:47.795]  Yeah, actually they emphasized more on how satellites can protect your children.
[01:36:47.795 --> 01:36:53.237]  Okay guys, search Channel 4 News Detroit, satellites to protect your children.
[01:36:53.237 --> 01:36:58.939]  Here's the deal, Germany's rolling out with RFID in the driver's license and passports.
[01:36:58.939 --> 01:37:02.280]  The US is doing it with Federal Standardization Real ID Act.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.762]  They admit it actually increases identity theft and stalking and control.
[01:37:07.122 --> 01:37:13.007]  Because hackers or government or anybody can get your name by driving by with scanners and reading it.
[01:37:13.007 --> 01:37:17.831]  Now we know Google is out with the NSA already doing this, capturing things illegally.
[01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:21.594]  But the government lets them do it because they are a quasi-government front group.
[01:37:21.594 --> 01:37:23.375]  But I will search that term.
[01:37:23.375 --> 01:37:24.576]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:24.576 --> 01:37:26.457]  Channel 4 News, Detroit.
[01:37:26.457 --> 01:37:29.740]  Satellites to protect your children from kidnapping.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:31.041]  That should bring it up.
[01:37:31.041 --> 01:37:33.843]  Okay, let's go to Rasheed in Maryland.
[01:37:33.843 --> 01:37:34.484]  You're on the air.
[01:37:35.779 --> 01:37:37.885]  Good day, Mr. Jones, how you doing?
[01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:40.732]  I tell you, they're moving faster than I thought.
[01:37:40.732 --> 01:37:41.374]  It's getting bad.
[01:37:42.199 --> 01:37:43.600]  I could dig it up.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.540]  I'm going to be quick.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.881]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:37:45.881 --> 01:37:55.005]  I called about a week or two ago, and I just want to point out a couple of things, and then maybe if you can answer a few of them or just respond to them, I'd greatly appreciate it.
[01:37:55.005 --> 01:38:08.731]  Just to let every Wallet Info Warrior out there know what I do, I order a couple hundred of pocket-sized Constitution Bill of Rights, and I hand them out just like business cards, along with DVDs every now and then.
[01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:10.372]  And I've gotten a good response from it.
[01:38:10.822 --> 01:38:12.342]  A couple of things that happened to me.
[01:38:12.342 --> 01:38:22.784]  A buddy of mine, he had recently, due to the school opening up now, he had to take his daughter to get immunized.
[01:38:22.784 --> 01:38:23.964]  But you don't have to.
[01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:28.525]  They lie and say it's the law, when it's only a regulation by law.
[01:38:28.525 --> 01:38:32.326]  In all 50 states, they've got to give you a waiver form.
[01:38:32.326 --> 01:38:33.526]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:38:33.526 --> 01:38:34.586]  And he didn't know about it.
[01:38:34.586 --> 01:38:39.127]  I tried to tell him that, but him and his wife, they said, you know, we're going to do it.
[01:38:39.127 --> 01:38:39.587]  They did it.
[01:38:40.286 --> 01:38:48.890]  Uh, that very night, uh, she woke up with violent itching and, uh, had a, uh, a high fever and vomiting.
[01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:53.672]  They then called the doctor and all his response was, well, this is normal.
[01:38:53.672 --> 01:38:55.793]  You know, you're supposed to wake up violent.
[01:38:55.793 --> 01:39:00.456]  Yeah, ten times the convulsions, autoimmune diseases, death, reduced fertility.
[01:39:00.456 --> 01:39:01.316]  It's loving.
[01:39:01.316 --> 01:39:04.117]  It's normal to have the troops dying from DU.
[01:39:04.117 --> 01:39:05.538]  It's normal to be radiated.
[01:39:05.538 --> 01:39:06.358]  It's normal.
[01:39:06.358 --> 01:39:07.339]  It's just all normal.
[01:39:08.234 --> 01:39:18.839]  Exactly, and so I did some research, and lo and behold, there are waivers of, you can claim either religious or philosophical issues with it.
[01:39:18.839 --> 01:39:21.100]  But it's a waiver to a non-law!
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:29.564]  They're trying to pass laws to make it mandatory, but they hoax and say it's the law in Texas, every girl must take Gardasil.
[01:39:29.564 --> 01:39:31.625]  It's all lies, it's just how crooked they are!
[01:39:32.665 --> 01:39:36.308]  And here's another surprising issue that happened to me.
[01:39:36.308 --> 01:39:38.309]  Yesterday, I was picking my son up.
[01:39:38.309 --> 01:39:40.671]  He goes to school in Pikesville, Maryland.
[01:39:40.671 --> 01:39:42.072]  High school in Pikesville, Maryland.
[01:39:42.072 --> 01:39:43.793]  He plays football there.
[01:39:43.793 --> 01:39:49.377]  Picking him up after a football practice, roughly around 8 o'clock at night or what have you.
[01:39:49.377 --> 01:39:51.899]  The sun was just basically going down around that time.
[01:39:52.738 --> 01:39:58.061]  And they were helicopters just flying everywhere throughout the area beaming down on the neighborhood.
[01:39:58.061 --> 01:39:58.901]  Yeah, I know.
[01:39:58.901 --> 01:40:01.542]  They don't just have 500 trucks looking through your house.
[01:40:01.542 --> 01:40:07.625]  They have hundreds of units we know about where they radiate and x-ray your house while you're in it.
[01:40:07.625 --> 01:40:10.227]  And the guys inside the helicopter are being radiated.
[01:40:10.227 --> 01:40:11.127]  You're being radiated.
[01:40:11.127 --> 01:40:12.067]  And they just love it.
[01:40:12.067 --> 01:40:12.568]  They love it.
[01:40:12.568 --> 01:40:13.808]  They won't say no.
[01:40:13.808 --> 01:40:14.969]  They love their job.
[01:40:14.969 --> 01:40:15.949]  And they love cancer.
[01:40:15.949 --> 01:40:16.710]  And they love death.
[01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:17.870]  Go ahead.
[01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:18.951]  Well, guess what?
[01:40:20.203 --> 01:40:21.284]  I'm asking my son.
[01:40:21.284 --> 01:40:22.944]  I said, man, have you seen this before?
[01:40:22.944 --> 01:40:25.946]  He says, well dad, because unfortunately he doesn't live with me.
[01:40:25.946 --> 01:40:26.866]  He stays with his mother.
[01:40:26.866 --> 01:40:30.628]  I'm dropping him off at his mother's house in Randallstown, Maryland.
[01:40:31.164 --> 01:40:40.131]  He says, well, Dad, they have this new curfew thing going on right now, and after 11, you're not supposed to be in the streets.
[01:40:40.131 --> 01:40:49.257]  They already have curfews all over the country where you're not allowed out in the day in places like Arkansas and Oklahoma, where they search you on the streets during the day.
[01:40:49.257 --> 01:40:50.658]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:40:50.658 --> 01:40:51.839]  Well, no, no problem.
[01:40:51.839 --> 01:41:00.185]  And just so, as I'm driving through his neighborhood, now this is Randallstown, Maryland, nowhere near the city, they have unmarked black vans in these
[01:41:00.672 --> 01:41:08.677]  Guys jump out in black uniforms with shotguns literally like just basically parading around the neighborhood.
[01:41:08.677 --> 01:41:22.086]  No, it's full acclamation for total martial law because they're publicly getting ready to devalue the dollar and take your pension funds and social security and they're taking the main police forces and giving them SWAT training and it's pure evil.
[01:41:23.117 --> 01:41:28.424]  And if you go to WJZ, it's Channel 13 News.
[01:41:28.424 --> 01:41:30.146]  It's local news here.
[01:41:30.146 --> 01:41:35.093]  They actually talk about it, 11 o'clock curfew, and they claim it's just to get the children off the street.
[01:41:35.838 --> 01:41:38.360]  No, no, no.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:50.268]  Now listen, they're going to have checkpoints on all the streets with naked body scanners, bathing you every week at least in radiation.
[01:41:50.268 --> 01:41:53.750]  They're going to pull up through every neighborhood, fry you with radiation every day.
[01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:56.432]  I mean, this is all being announced.
[01:41:56.432 --> 01:41:58.533]  Military checkpoints, everything.
[01:41:58.533 --> 01:42:03.277]  You've got mayors from California to New York asking for martial law.
[01:42:06.198 --> 01:42:13.061]  And lastly, I just wanted to get your insight or what have you.
[01:42:13.061 --> 01:42:18.604]  What do you think about this Chinese with their new carrier killer missile?
[01:42:18.604 --> 01:42:20.005]  Where do you think that will go?
[01:42:20.005 --> 01:42:21.865]  Where are they going with that advertisement?
[01:42:23.556 --> 01:42:28.519]  They claim it's going to reshape sea combat and all, so I just wanted to get your input on that as well.
[01:42:28.519 --> 01:42:36.403]  Well, the Chinese are good eugenicist globalists that murder their people and dehumanize them en masse, so they're a big part of the team, and the New World Order plans to suck the U.S.
[01:42:36.403 --> 01:42:47.548]  dry and move to China, and so they're going to be the new power, and they'll play us off against each other, and we buy toasters and DVD players from them, and they take the money and buy
[01:42:48.749 --> 01:42:49.449]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:42:49.449 --> 01:42:49.990]  I got two things.
[01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:51.750]  I hope you'll let me get to it.
[01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:54.571]  First, I just finished reading William Shirer's book about the Third Reich.
[01:43:17.748 --> 01:43:19.969]  Right, that's a great book.
[01:43:19.969 --> 01:43:36.532]  I've heard you talk many times on the show about, uh, mention something about at Dunkirk, when the, at the evacuation of Dunkirk, and then, uh, later... Albert, uh, Rudolph Hess.
[01:43:36.532 --> 01:43:40.073]  Yeah, Hess, and then Hitler deciding to attack, uh,
[01:43:40.775 --> 01:44:00.151]  Russia and I've heard you say that there was come cut there was a secret deal or something Yeah, I know that's even come out in the British newspapers in the last few years But I've read so many books about World War two no exaggeration probably more than a hundred I was kind of on that kick when I was 12 13 14 15 and
[01:44:02.273 --> 01:44:04.915]  And since then I've probably read 10 or 15 books.
[01:44:04.915 --> 01:44:07.477]  It's well over 100 total.
[01:44:07.477 --> 01:44:10.999]  So it all becomes foggy, which books and where, but I've seen news articles.
[01:44:10.999 --> 01:44:16.503]  In fact, guys, search engine, Hitler's secret treaty with England.
[01:44:16.503 --> 01:44:21.066]  And Rudolf Hess had the treaty, the deputy fuhrer.
[01:44:21.066 --> 01:44:22.427]  And remember, he was a pilot.
[01:44:22.427 --> 01:44:25.329]  He flew in to England right at the start of the Blitz.
[01:44:25.329 --> 01:44:26.309]  He parachuted in.
[01:44:27.230 --> 01:44:32.151]  And they locked him up in the tower for the rest of his life with the treaty.
[01:44:32.151 --> 01:44:33.071]  And they had a deal.
[01:44:33.071 --> 01:44:36.072]  Of course, the King of England, Edward VIII, was a Nazi.
[01:44:36.072 --> 01:44:37.913]  There's photos of him hailing Hitler.
[01:44:37.913 --> 01:44:40.873]  Once the war started, he had to run to Spain to get out.
[01:44:40.873 --> 01:44:41.653]  And they'd made a deal.
[01:44:41.653 --> 01:44:43.554]  He was German himself.
[01:44:43.554 --> 01:44:46.975]  And Lord Milner Group, others said, we'll set up a dictator.
[01:44:46.975 --> 01:44:47.975]  This was decades before.
[01:44:48.815 --> 01:44:55.999]  Then we'll have a war with them and Hitler allowed most of them and said we won't let the military kill them all.
[01:44:55.999 --> 01:45:04.363]  We'll do some target practice on some of the ships with the Luftwaffe headed up by Hermann Goering, a World War I ace himself, had the Luftwaffe.
[01:45:05.243 --> 01:45:09.865]  Uh, and they let most of them escape at Dunkirk from France to England.
[01:45:09.865 --> 01:45:12.807]  And then Hitler wouldn't target the major British cities.
[01:45:12.807 --> 01:45:14.707]  He would only target military bases.
[01:45:14.707 --> 01:45:25.792]  So the British launched a giant Lancaster attack to bomb Berlin to psychologically manipulate Hitler to retaliate to bomb London and other British cities to get British resolve behind the war.
[01:45:25.792 --> 01:45:27.933]  And I've even seen that on the History Channel.
[01:45:27.933 --> 01:45:29.034]  Uh, but yes, that's all there.
[01:45:31.243 --> 01:45:40.173]  I thought maybe it had something to do with his decision to turn around and attack Stalin, Russia.
[01:45:40.173 --> 01:45:49.123]  I thought he meant maybe England had manipulated him and said, well, why don't you attack Russia and then we'll make peace with you later or something.
[01:45:50.358 --> 01:45:58.183]  No, there were overtures and that's why Heinrich Himmler and others turned themselves into the Allies and then were murdered, committed suicide.
[01:45:58.183 --> 01:46:09.809]  You know, they would show up and that's why the British, just like the globalists set up Saddam Hussein so he was easy to defeat because most of his top generals were double agents, it was the same thing with the Germans.
[01:46:09.809 --> 01:46:11.190]  They were British intelligence.
[01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:13.291]  And so Hitler never had a chance.
[01:46:13.291 --> 01:46:15.372]  It was all a massive setup.
[01:46:15.372 --> 01:46:19.935]  And that's in all the major mainline history, if you really mine down deep.
[01:46:19.935 --> 01:46:27.360]  No, but then Hitler figured out he'd been double-crossed and there was a deal with Stalin to take over Germany and divide up Europe.
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.964]  And so he turned, saying if I can rush in with Barbarossa, Operation Barbarossa, and take over
[01:46:34.827 --> 01:46:39.649]  Yeah, he had been planning Barbarossa and planning to attack Russia for quite a long time and just finally did it.
[01:47:01.558 --> 01:47:09.563]  It did seem like there was a lot of things that they didn't explain, or there were so many things that seemed like they were an accident, or, oh, that was just a slip-up.
[01:47:09.563 --> 01:47:11.664]  Yeah, no, Scherer's book's good for an overview.
[01:47:11.664 --> 01:47:24.292]  If you want to hear about the secret societies and all the intrigue and how they set up the SS along Jesuit lines, it's Order of the Death's Head by Heinz Hobel, but they all have disinformation.
[01:47:24.292 --> 01:47:30.516]  You've got to read hundreds of books and then study original history and declassified documents to get a full-spectrum breakdown.
[01:47:31.701 --> 01:47:50.095]  What did you think about how Hitler used to talk all the time about or a lot about international financiers and you know he usually said Jewish, international Jewish financiers manipulating the countries into war and stuff.
[01:47:50.095 --> 01:47:59.181]  That's what he would talk, he talked about them and the Jewish financiers around, grouped around Roosevelt that wanted to get him into war and stuff.
[01:47:59.181 --> 01:48:00.563]  Why do you think he talked about that?
[01:48:00.563 --> 01:48:01.063]  Was he like
[01:48:02.473 --> 01:48:06.297]  Uh, being disingenuous, or was he a dupe that didn't realize?
[01:48:06.297 --> 01:48:19.531]  Well, no, I mean, of course there was the Rothschilds, and the Rothschilds, it's been in Anthony Sutton's books off of Congressional Senate hearings, that they would always fund both sides.
[01:48:19.531 --> 01:48:24.517]  And so, you know, there were those financiers involved in the larger system.
[01:48:25.057 --> 01:48:29.198]  I mean, World War I was financed by different financiers, including the Rothschilds.
[01:48:29.198 --> 01:48:37.379]  That's what globalism is, is these corporations play groups off against each other.
[01:48:37.379 --> 01:48:52.882]  But Hitler had a brand of eugenics that was going to focus in on mainly the Jews and others, Slavs, because they wanted to kill most of the Slavs for, what is it, Lebensraum, if that's the proper pronunciation, living space.
[01:48:53.522 --> 01:48:57.269]  And so it was really just a racial way to get people hyped up.
[01:48:57.269 --> 01:49:01.737]  But I mean always, you know, there's some sliver of reality within that.
[01:49:01.737 --> 01:49:04.723]  But Hitler also thought that England was more Aryan.
[01:49:05.598 --> 01:49:14.865]  Then Germany, because England hadn't been overrun by some of the Eastern European groups and also the Arabs.
[01:49:14.865 --> 01:49:19.949]  And so that's why he didn't want to bomb England or bomb the cities because of the precious Aryan blood.
[01:49:19.949 --> 01:49:24.552]  I mean, it's all really a bunch of convoluted stuff, but you can read about that in My Struggle, Mein Kampf.
[01:49:24.552 --> 01:49:25.353]  Of course, I read that.
[01:49:25.353 --> 01:49:27.574]  I remember I was about 13 at the bookstore.
[01:49:27.574 --> 01:49:31.517]  My mom dropped me off at the mall, and I walked over and bought Mein Kampf.
[01:49:31.517 --> 01:49:34.380]  And I went up to buy it, and the black lady behind the counter freaked out.
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:39.961]  And it was like thinking I was a Nazi and I said, lady, you're selling this book.
[01:49:39.961 --> 01:49:42.902]  Just because I'm reading something doesn't mean I'm that.
[01:49:42.902 --> 01:49:46.863]  I mean, at 13 years old, I knew that.
[01:49:46.863 --> 01:49:49.844]  And it was, you know, it's just insane.
[01:49:49.844 --> 01:49:54.305]  But again, they go in and pick nationalistic groups.
[01:49:56.758 --> 01:49:59.059]  It's high-powered psychological warfare.
[01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:00.360]  They build it up.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.682]  They financed Hitler's ideology.
[01:50:02.682 --> 01:50:04.963]  He was given Rockefeller Awards.
[01:50:04.963 --> 01:50:08.985]  He was given all this funding and then told he was a big hero.
[01:50:08.985 --> 01:50:12.908]  Up until about 37, 38, he was a rock star in the U.S.
[01:50:12.908 --> 01:50:14.969]  Time Magazine Man of the Year.
[01:50:14.969 --> 01:50:16.730]  He was in gardening magazines.
[01:50:16.730 --> 01:50:18.611]  He was all over radio.
[01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:20.372]  He was being praised.
[01:50:20.372 --> 01:50:20.733]  And so,
[01:50:21.826 --> 01:50:32.513]  He was encouraged by IBM and encouraged by a lot of these big, powerful groups to do what he did.
[01:50:32.513 --> 01:50:43.200]  So there were other factions, and there was a pro-Hitler faction with the Bushes, and this came out in the McCormick-Dickstein Committee, and Spendley Butler exposed it.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:49.825]  They tried to hire him, the Marine Corps general, to stage a coup against Roosevelt, saying he was a Jewish communist.
[01:50:52.810 --> 01:50:54.492]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:54.492 --> 01:51:02.222]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:02.222 --> 01:51:03.403]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:09.631 --> 01:51:12.812]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:51:12.812 --> 01:51:18.395]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.

[01:53:06.427 --> 01:53:12.129]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[01:53:12.129 --> 01:53:19.272]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[01:53:19.272 --> 01:53:28.035]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.

[01:53:32.379 --> 01:53:39.227]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[01:53:39.227 --> 01:53:48.017]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[01:53:48.157 --> 01:53:52.819]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.

[01:53:52.999 --> 01:53:53.219]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[01:53:53.219 --> 01:53:54.619]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:53:54.619 --> 01:53:56.020]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:09.701 --> 01:54:12.441]  We're back live, continuing with your phone call.
[01:54:12.441 --> 01:54:21.863]  Since the caller mentioned Hitler, I want to tell you next hour, Hitler had Jewish and African roots, DNA test of 39 living relatives show conclusively.
[01:54:21.863 --> 01:54:31.025]  Well, anybody in Europe, all the DNA studies have shown the original mitochondrial DNA is African.
[01:54:31.025 --> 01:54:37.126]  I mean, mitochondrial DNA never changes and is basically
[01:54:38.888 --> 01:54:46.641]  The original core doesn't change according to what I've seen the geneticists report on and it's passed on and by the mother.
[01:54:47.466 --> 01:54:49.247]  There's two kinds of DNA.
[01:54:49.247 --> 01:54:54.412]  And so, but they're testing the non-mitochondrial and finding it as well.
[01:54:54.412 --> 01:54:57.454]  I mean, Europe has been overrun over and over again.
[01:54:57.454 --> 01:54:59.175]  They've studied people in India.
[01:54:59.175 --> 01:55:01.097]  They're full of Nordic blood.
[01:55:01.097 --> 01:55:02.418]  They've studied people in China.
[01:55:02.418 --> 01:55:07.102]  They've dug up thousands of graves with people that still have hair.
[01:55:07.102 --> 01:55:10.825]  I've seen it in National Geographic, blonde hair, six foot tall.
[01:55:10.825 --> 01:55:13.927]  I mean, humans have been traveling everywhere.
[01:55:13.927 --> 01:55:15.769]  What do you think Hispanics are?
[01:55:17.222 --> 01:55:19.343]  They're European.
[01:55:19.343 --> 01:55:22.425]  Whenever they have these illegal alien rallies, they're saying, go home to Europe, pilgrim.
[01:55:22.425 --> 01:55:28.148]  Go home to Europe, you're European and Asian.
[01:55:28.148 --> 01:55:44.998]  The genetics of the pure tribal Indians of Central South America who haven't intermarried with Spanish and Portuguese folks that moved in and other ethnic groups to a certain extent, Austrian, German, there's a lot of that, French in the Caribbean, Central South America.
[01:55:46.391 --> 01:55:50.772]  I said I'd cover it next hour, I'm already covering it here.
[01:55:50.772 --> 01:55:53.973]  They are Asian.
[01:55:53.973 --> 01:55:59.075]  They are basically closely akin to Chinese and Japanese.
[01:55:59.075 --> 01:56:06.757]  If you study their genetics, going back to groups that were in Northern East Asia, because where's Japan?
[01:56:06.757 --> 01:56:10.758]  Japan is right up by Russia in the Pacific Ocean.
[01:56:11.769 --> 01:56:13.030]  The North Pacific.
[01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:15.352]  And it's just miles away from Russia.
[01:56:15.352 --> 01:56:19.215]  What color do you think the people are that live in Far Eastern Russia?
[01:56:19.215 --> 01:56:20.216]  They're Asians!
[01:56:20.216 --> 01:56:21.036]  They look Chinese!
[01:56:22.267 --> 01:56:29.770]  Well, those are the people that migrated 30,000 plus years ago, the DNA shows, into the Americas.
[01:56:29.770 --> 01:56:31.330]  And now I saw this on the news.
[01:56:31.330 --> 01:56:35.112]  I'd already seen previous reports where they've dug up Norse all over North America.
[01:56:35.112 --> 01:56:40.614]  They've done all this DNA testing on pure Indian tribes, Native Americans.
[01:56:40.614 --> 01:56:42.894]  They've even dug up graves of people that were known to be 100% pure.
[01:56:42.894 --> 01:56:44.395]  And it's 100% because they can go back
[01:56:48.049 --> 01:56:58.777]  They can go back and tell how far back in the DNA it goes and it goes back 5,000 years or more to Nordic people.
[01:56:58.777 --> 01:57:04.622]  So no one is pure Chinese or pure German or pure Jewish or pure Brit.
[01:57:04.622 --> 01:57:09.886]  I mean, Britain was constantly invaded over and over again by different tribes.
[01:57:09.886 --> 01:57:17.592]  The Brits themselves were Germanic and Visigoth groups that invaded and took over Northern England.
[01:57:18.834 --> 01:57:29.217]  And then you had the Celtic people, Celtic, Celtic, whatever you want to call it, tomato, tomato, that moved up into the North and were driven out into other areas.
[01:57:29.217 --> 01:57:32.258]  And you had Vikings always invading.
[01:57:32.258 --> 01:57:36.039]  So of course Hitler has Semitic blood.
[01:57:36.039 --> 01:57:39.099]  Of course he had African blood.
[01:57:39.099 --> 01:57:40.940]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:57:42.136 --> 01:57:47.678]  All these people that's, I mean, you know, I've seen black groups that say, if you have one drop of white blood, you're a devil.
[01:57:47.678 --> 01:57:55.801]  And I see groups say, if you have one drop of, you know, if you're an Aryan and you have one drop of somebody else's blood, you know, that you're a devil and it's the devil seed.
[01:57:55.801 --> 01:57:57.942]  Well, then you're all going to hell folks.
[01:57:57.942 --> 01:58:01.223]  Cause we all come from the same mitochondrial DNA.
[01:58:03.186 --> 01:58:05.628]  Continuing, Hitler had Jewish and African roots.
[01:58:05.628 --> 01:58:09.250]  London Telegraph, Adolf Hitler is likely to have had Jewish and African roots.
[01:58:09.250 --> 01:58:10.911]  DNA tests have shown.
[01:58:10.911 --> 01:58:20.738]  Saliva samples taken from 39 relatives of the Nazi leader show he may have biological links to sub-human races, that's in quotes, that he tried to exterminate during the Holocaust.
[01:58:20.738 --> 01:58:28.323]  Jean-Paul Mulders, a Belgian journalist, and Mark Verman, a historian, tracked down the Fuhrer's relatives, including an Austrian farmer,
[01:58:28.823 --> 01:58:30.485]  Who was his cousin earlier this year.
[01:58:30.485 --> 01:58:32.246]  It all shows the same thing.
[01:58:32.246 --> 01:58:36.370]  The chromosome called E1B1B1.
[01:58:36.370 --> 01:58:37.251]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:37.251 --> 01:58:43.337]  Stay with us.

[01:59:53.556 --> 01:59:55.957]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.957 --> 02:00:05.441]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:06.762]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.762 --> 02:00:08.522]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.522 --> 02:00:10.283]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.283 --> 02:00:11.864]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.864 --> 02:00:13.424]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.424 --> 02:00:17.606]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.606 --> 02:00:21.668]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.035 --> 02:00:43.339]  We are now into our number three wide open phones and a bunch of really insane financial news.
[02:00:43.339 --> 02:00:46.181]  It gets more murderous by the minute.
[02:00:46.181 --> 02:00:48.422]  Major cutbacks to police forces all over the country.
[02:00:48.422 --> 02:00:50.404]  We've been talking about that the last year.
[02:00:50.404 --> 02:00:52.705]  Here it is in USA Today.
[02:00:52.705 --> 02:00:56.467]  The Pentagon is openly taking over our towns and cities covertly.
[02:00:56.467 --> 02:00:57.768]  It's so illegal.
[02:00:57.768 --> 02:00:59.829]  It's why we have Posse Comitatus.
[02:00:59.829 --> 02:01:00.770]  Look at the third world.
[02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:02.091]  The military is always taking over.
[02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:05.564]  And that doesn't mean the average military man or woman.
[02:01:05.564 --> 02:01:08.124]  The people running the system are crooks.
[02:01:08.124 --> 02:01:11.305]  Just like the Germans weren't bad people, but Hitler was bad.
[02:01:11.305 --> 02:01:12.225]  They're commanders.
[02:01:12.225 --> 02:01:13.826]  The Russians weren't bad people.
[02:01:13.826 --> 02:01:16.066]  Lenin and Stalin were bad.
[02:01:16.066 --> 02:01:20.147]  Henry, you know, the 8th was a bad guy, but the Brits weren't bad people.
[02:01:20.147 --> 02:01:21.788]  I mean, it's so elementary.
[02:01:21.788 --> 02:01:25.189]  Let's go to Jake and PA, then Nathan, Tony, Michael, Joe and others.
[02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:27.289]  Jake, you're on the air.
[02:01:27.289 --> 02:01:28.290]  Hey, what's up?
[02:01:28.290 --> 02:01:29.350]  Worldwide transmission.
[02:01:30.882 --> 02:01:37.071]  Alright, well, uh, basically I wanted to make a point about the mosque at Ground Zero.
[02:01:37.071 --> 02:01:40.616]  I do believe people are misinterpreting what's going on there.
[02:01:41.428 --> 02:01:43.169]  You want to hear my take on it?
[02:01:43.169 --> 02:01:44.770]  Well, I have the absolute take.
[02:01:44.770 --> 02:02:00.457]  By the way, did you guys print that link that I was telling you about from the Mosque's website itself, where they said their number one funder is actually not the Fox News owner, he's a big one, but that it's the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:02:00.457 --> 02:02:03.018]  So we 100% now know what this is, and that's a big story.
[02:02:03.018 --> 02:02:03.639]  I meant to get to it.
[02:02:03.639 --> 02:02:05.019]  Go ahead.
[02:02:05.019 --> 02:02:06.900]  Well, that's a part of it.
[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:10.682]  The people funding it is a part of the situation, but actually I do believe
[02:02:11.670 --> 02:02:20.435]  They're setting that up because they're engineering an assassination attempt on Obama so that, you know, they can implement their martial law.
[02:02:20.435 --> 02:02:20.915]  I agree.
[02:02:20.915 --> 02:02:28.139]  I said nine months ago, I said nine months ago, I concur with you that Obama is one of the false flag cards they've got in their hip pocket.
[02:02:28.139 --> 02:02:29.480]  Go ahead.
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:30.101]  Exactly.
[02:02:30.101 --> 02:02:39.086]  And I believe that's why you're having all this Muslim, anti-Muslim fervor and conflict and tension rising.
[02:02:39.086 --> 02:02:41.407]  You know, you have Fox coming out with a poll that
[02:02:42.433 --> 02:02:44.914]  20% of people think, you know, U.S.
[02:02:44.914 --> 02:02:47.914]  citizens think Obama's a Muslim.
[02:02:47.914 --> 02:02:50.055]  He was born in a Muslim country.
[02:02:50.055 --> 02:03:02.598]  They're basically painting him, as you know, your poster boy Muslim, so that when they have a CIA front militia group, you know, try to assassinate him.
[02:03:02.598 --> 02:03:03.158]  Bingo!
[02:03:03.158 --> 02:03:06.719]  Yeah, they could pin it on a militia group and then
[02:03:07.748 --> 02:03:11.710]  You know, they could implement their martial law, try to confiscate guns and whatnot.
[02:03:11.710 --> 02:03:12.351]  Well, hold on!
[02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:14.472]  I'm going to hold you over and give you the floor.
[02:03:14.472 --> 02:03:16.553]  I'm going to put you on hold because I want to cover this now.
[02:03:16.553 --> 02:03:21.816]  I don't want people to get this video out to everyone off of PrisonPlanet.tv or the Radio Simulcast.
[02:03:21.816 --> 02:03:25.678]  I want you to recap everything you're saying when we come back, but I don't want to cut you short now.
[02:03:25.678 --> 02:03:26.898]  We'll put it back on screen.
[02:03:26.898 --> 02:03:32.842]  There is the Emam's International Philanthropic Organization.
[02:03:33.928 --> 02:03:36.510]  Number one funder, Carnegie Corporation of New York.
[02:03:36.510 --> 02:03:38.312]  Number two, Rockefeller Brothers.
[02:03:38.312 --> 02:03:41.234]  Number three, Rockefeller Philanthropy.
[02:03:41.234 --> 02:03:43.716]  Number four, Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
[02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:48.180]  Now, I went and looked at that last night and added up the amounts they say they've given.
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:54.845]  So when I say Rockefeller's number one, if you add the three together, it's bigger than the Carnegie Corporation for New York.
[02:03:54.845 --> 02:03:59.348]  And in the 40s and 70s, they had congressional hearings that we've read the quotes from here.
[02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:01.750]  of the tax-free foundations.
[02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:06.111]  Just search the term Congressional and Senate investigations of tax-free foundations.
[02:04:06.111 --> 02:04:06.992]  They got their minutes.
[02:04:06.992 --> 02:04:08.993]  They said we're going to set up a world government.
[02:04:08.993 --> 02:04:11.554]  We're going to finance World War I and World War II.
[02:04:11.554 --> 02:04:14.455]  We're going to buy off the churches with the World Council of Churches.
[02:04:14.455 --> 02:04:16.095]  We're going to buy off the Muslims.
[02:04:16.095 --> 02:04:18.016]  We're going to buy off the Hindus.
[02:04:18.016 --> 02:04:21.377]  And we're going to secretly finance them murdering each other.
[02:04:21.377 --> 02:04:23.298]  And then we'll be the arbiter.
[02:04:23.298 --> 02:04:24.239]  We'll be the
[02:04:25.359 --> 02:04:30.081]  Referee of all of this, posing as the people that are liberal and want peace.
[02:04:30.081 --> 02:04:40.465]  And the Carnegie Endowment said, contrary to stopping war, our endowment for peace, we will be the progenitors of war, because war is the health of the state.
[02:04:40.465 --> 02:04:44.927]  This is our full spectrum dominance control system by playing all sides.
[02:04:44.927 --> 02:04:45.648]  And so, yes.
[02:04:46.568 --> 02:04:48.711]  And this EMOM may not even know how he's being played.
[02:04:48.711 --> 02:04:53.556]  He's CFR, Trilateral Commission, New World Order, Fox News is involved.
[02:04:53.556 --> 02:04:54.658]  Playing all sides.
[02:04:54.658 --> 02:04:55.759]  Stay there, Jake.
[02:04:55.759 --> 02:04:56.780]  We're coming back to you.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.943]  Then Nathan, Tony, Michael, Joe, and others.
[02:04:58.943 --> 02:04:59.504]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.504 --> 02:05:00.525]  Key intel.
[02:05:00.525 --> 02:05:05.070]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:05:05.070 --> 02:05:05.651]  Number one.
[02:05:05.971 --> 02:05:10.254]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:10.254 --> 02:05:15.138]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.138 --> 02:05:15.878]  It's true.
[02:05:15.878 --> 02:05:21.583]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.583 --> 02:05:25.165]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.165 --> 02:05:28.868]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.068 --> 02:05:29.868]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.868 --> 02:05:32.629]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:36.310]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:37.090]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.090 --> 02:05:41.231]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.231 --> 02:05:46.293]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.293 --> 02:05:50.474]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.474 --> 02:05:52.255]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:52.255 --> 02:05:56.856]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:05:57.356 --> 02:05:57.556]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:57.556 --> 02:06:03.382]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:06:03.382 --> 02:06:07.165]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.

[02:07:00.203 --> 02:07:05.187]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:05.187 --> 02:07:06.167]  What have we got?
[02:07:06.167 --> 02:07:08.609]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:08.609 --> 02:07:09.610]  A republic.
[02:07:09.610 --> 02:07:12.271]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:12.271 --> 02:07:14.533]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:14.533 --> 02:07:16.554]  Two wolves in a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:16.554 --> 02:07:18.236]  So they think they own our land?
[02:07:18.236 --> 02:07:19.557]  They think they own our water?
[02:07:19.557 --> 02:07:20.157]  Children?
[02:07:20.157 --> 02:07:21.278]  Our education?
[02:07:21.278 --> 02:07:22.118]  Our money?
[02:07:22.118 --> 02:07:25.781]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:26.121 --> 02:07:31.109]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:32.131]  We have the facts.
[02:07:32.131 --> 02:07:33.292]  We have the Constitution.
[02:07:33.292 --> 02:07:34.194]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:07:34.194 --> 02:07:35.095]  We have common law.
[02:07:35.095 --> 02:07:37.619]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:37.619 --> 02:07:41.385]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:07:41.485 --> 02:07:46.449]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:07:46.449 --> 02:07:47.931]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:07:47.931 --> 02:07:49.032]  Don't tread on me.
[02:07:49.032 --> 02:07:55.898]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:08:07.617 --> 02:08:22.711]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:08:22.711 --> 02:08:25.354]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:29.383 --> 02:08:34.469]  Big News Blitz and Key Video Clip Blitz coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:34.469 --> 02:08:37.091]  Let's continue with Jake and PA.
[02:08:37.091 --> 02:08:50.886]  If you just joined us, there's so much happening in this full-spectrum dominance, scientific dictatorship, central banking warfare model that we're fighting that I love taking calls because they bring up key issues, they bring up key ideas.
[02:08:51.887 --> 02:08:52.067]  I don't
[02:09:11.423 --> 02:09:19.647]  You can experience it and live this ongoing education and awakening that I'm going through, that my crew's going through, that you're going through.
[02:09:19.647 --> 02:09:29.411]  It's a group experience and is symbiotic and is multifaceted, multivariate, and is interactive with us together.
[02:09:29.411 --> 02:09:36.954]  Now, he brought up something that I noticed going back two years ago before he even got elected, right before he got elected going into the election.
[02:09:36.954 --> 02:09:39.435]  It's almost two years in November, a couple months.
[02:09:40.794 --> 02:09:45.696]  That they were building him up as a messianic god who would save everyone and end racism.
[02:09:45.696 --> 02:09:50.237]  But I knew the big tax-free foundations fund racism and social division.
[02:09:50.237 --> 02:09:55.059]  Tribalism is what the sociologists and anthropologists actually call it, the psych warfare chiefs.
[02:09:56.232 --> 02:09:57.754]  And that he would not deliver.
[02:09:57.754 --> 02:09:59.696]  He had the very same advisors.
[02:09:59.696 --> 02:10:01.978]  That he would actually accelerate the tyranny.
[02:10:01.978 --> 02:10:03.981]  Every president it gets worse since Kennedy.
[02:10:03.981 --> 02:10:05.863]  Since the full spectrum coup happened.
[02:10:05.863 --> 02:10:08.165]  They were already in control but they really took control then.
[02:10:08.165 --> 02:10:11.509]  They had their beachhead 1913 Federal Reserve Act.
[02:10:11.509 --> 02:10:15.573]  And that they would build him up then destroy him politically.
[02:10:16.494 --> 02:10:23.780]  Anytime you criticize government-run healthcare, wars, torture, secret police, anything they're doing, you're a racist.
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:25.802]  They would invoke that.
[02:10:25.802 --> 02:10:34.089]  Anytime you disagree with any of his policies, and he's just a front man, a Harvard teleprompter reading lawyer, though, you know, smarter than Bush, the last puppet.
[02:10:36.087 --> 02:10:59.926]  And that they were building up to re-invoke Oklahoma City and the Patriot Movement, and stage terror attacks to be blamed on us, including in that spectrum, and claiming we're all white Al Qaeda, and saying if you don't like corrupt government, you're... I saw a CNN piece with POTOC, and he was saying, a lot of black groups are becoming sovereign citizens and refusing to go through the system.
[02:10:59.926 --> 02:11:02.748]  Little do they know they're following a white supremacist ideology.
[02:11:02.748 --> 02:11:03.789]  Well, what does that have to do with it?
[02:11:04.522 --> 02:11:07.543]  This is, oh my gosh, black people are getting into this.
[02:11:07.543 --> 02:11:10.043]  And of course, there's a spectrum of sovereign citizen groups.
[02:11:10.043 --> 02:11:15.725]  There's people that are hardcore accurate, and then kooks out there that are filing fake papers.
[02:11:15.725 --> 02:11:21.206]  But on this piece, they go, this one family filed paperwork and stole a house.
[02:11:21.206 --> 02:11:24.287]  And then it went on to say, their house.
[02:11:24.287 --> 02:11:27.788]  I always hear, a woman has kidnapped a child, Amber Alerts.
[02:11:27.788 --> 02:11:32.069]  Then it says, CPS ordered the woman to turn her child in, and she's disappeared.
[02:11:34.528 --> 02:11:50.437]  So, they are always invoking this, and yes, Obama better know that either an attempted assassination, they've already primed the pump with some of these, or a real op, where they kill him deader than a hammer, and it is gonna be hellish.
[02:11:50.437 --> 02:12:01.863]  And it will cause race riots, no doubt, it will cause total false flag demonization of anybody that criticizes government, and they'll use him as the sacrificial lamb to ram through their entire agenda.
[02:12:01.863 --> 02:12:03.984]  So, pray for Obama's safety.
[02:12:05.663 --> 02:12:07.585]  Okay, well basically, I don't believe
[02:12:35.422 --> 02:12:36.665]  Obama is a Muslim.
[02:12:36.665 --> 02:12:38.728]  I don't believe that he believes in God.
[02:12:38.728 --> 02:12:41.614]  I think he's one of these Illuminati, you know, shape-shifting...
[02:12:42.656 --> 02:12:50.738]  He's a nihilistic front man who loves to party and use drugs.
[02:12:50.738 --> 02:12:54.939]  He admits it and is bisexual and reads off teleprompters.
[02:12:54.939 --> 02:12:57.179]  I mean, they're just worldly scum.
[02:12:57.179 --> 02:13:09.642]  When you look at actual globalists at the top, they are very pious and cult-like and focused and all of them give money to Luciferian groups and they hate humanity and want to kill people.
[02:13:10.902 --> 02:13:12.943]  And Obama doesn't have those characteristics.
[02:13:12.943 --> 02:13:17.366]  He's a literal front man.
[02:13:17.366 --> 02:13:25.630]  Well, basically my point is, they're starting to really focus on, you know, people's opinion of him being a Muslim.
[02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:36.896]  And with all this tension that they've raised between the Muslim and non-Muslim communities, they're setting up the perfect scenario to pull this type of staged event and, you know, blame it on a
[02:13:37.443 --> 02:13:39.965]  Militia group that's nothing but a CIA front.
[02:13:39.965 --> 02:13:54.979]  Let's be clear, if you're in a poker game with a card shark and he's got ten cards in there, ace of spades, you name it, it doesn't mean he's going to play the queen of diamonds, you know, this Manchurian candidate.
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:14:08.330]  It doesn't mean that, or the Queen of Hearts, it doesn't mean that just because it's in the sleeve, just remember it's in the arsenal, and it does clearly look like they are preparing that and are looking at green lighting it.
[02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:10.792]  Go ahead.
[02:14:10.792 --> 02:14:21.540]  Well, that's basically my point with that, and then, you know, if they did actually go through with it, you know, that would be the perfect excuse to have their martial law and confiscate guns and whatnot.
[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:23.822]  Now, the second point that I did want to make
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:48.955]  Another thing that I kind of see that the globalists did, and actually Jesse Ventura did a conspiracy show on this on the HAARP Weather Radio Transmitter, and basically with Pakistan, now you had that general on a couple weeks ago and he explained how, you know, the intel that, you know, many people are reporting was in the WikiLeaks exposure, you know, was
[02:14:49.761 --> 02:14:56.762]  We're basically exposing the fact that our government has been working inside Pakistan to, you know, destabilize the country.
[02:14:56.762 --> 02:14:59.643]  And you burn Russia, you flood Pakistan.
[02:14:59.643 --> 02:15:03.343]  They can do it with the jet streams over the pole.
[02:15:03.343 --> 02:15:08.964]  The 1997 Army briefing with the Secretary of Defense William Cohen, April 28, 1997.
[02:15:08.964 --> 02:15:13.945]  He said, we have weather weapons and tectonic weapons.
[02:15:13.945 --> 02:15:15.585]  They have HAARP facilities everywhere.
[02:15:15.585 --> 02:15:17.446]  I have the director of HAARP on.
[02:15:17.446 --> 02:15:19.206]  He admitted they can even ignite the atmosphere.
[02:15:20.686 --> 02:15:27.388]  Correct.
[02:15:27.388 --> 02:15:38.211]  Well, I do feel that, you know, it is kind of too much of a coincidence that right after the WikiLeaks exposure, you do have the massive flooding in Pakistan.
[02:15:38.211 --> 02:15:39.671]  And why would they do that?
[02:15:39.671 --> 02:15:40.631]  Why would they do that?
[02:15:40.631 --> 02:15:46.673]  To bankrupt them further to be under the control of the IMF and World Bank.
[02:15:46.673 --> 02:15:47.193]  Exactly.
[02:15:47.193 --> 02:15:48.193]  And not only that, but
[02:15:49.222 --> 02:16:03.917]  It furthers help in destabilizing the country, which makes it easier for them to try to overtake and take control of, because obviously they know... And by the way, they don't need HAARP to cause flooding.
[02:16:03.917 --> 02:16:10.523]  I've had the father of weather weapons on, declassified, Ben Livingston, with eight modern aircraft, he can make
[02:16:11.644 --> 02:16:20.190]  You know, during the hurricane season, a mega hurricane, or kill it, or weaken it, with aircraft, they can go in during the monsoon and hit them and hit them hard.
[02:16:20.190 --> 02:16:27.416]  They can do it outside their airspace, but we have aircraft all over their airspace, so they don't need to use their high-tech weapons.
[02:16:27.416 --> 02:16:30.838]  They've got low-tech cloud seating.
[02:16:30.838 --> 02:16:31.819]  Well, that may be true.
[02:16:31.819 --> 02:16:37.042]  Well, in either way, I do feel, you know, these floods are being man-manipulated.
[02:16:37.042 --> 02:16:40.125]  I don't believe it's just a natural course of reality.
[02:16:41.445 --> 02:16:59.576]  In my experience with these New World Order people, because I have had direct experience with it and I do know exactly what they're trying to do, I realize there's no such thing as coincidences and I definitely think because their covert operations were exposed, well now they gotta hit them with an environmental operation.
[02:16:59.576 --> 02:17:04.019]  I hear ya, I gotta jump though, I need to get to the caller's good points.
[02:17:04.019 --> 02:17:07.822]  I understand their full spectrum dominance so well from years of deep research.
[02:17:08.666 --> 02:17:23.533]  That, I can lay there in bed at about midnight, think of something horrible, because I know their mind, like Hamid Gul said, I read their mind, because I literally, that's what a good general does, is you put yourself in their place, you think like them.
[02:17:23.533 --> 02:17:33.678]  I can think of something horrible, go in and search it and find mainstream news, and it's almost always brand new, it's almost like because it's gone to the ether, because it's now being done,
[02:17:36.263 --> 02:17:43.348]  It's like four or five guys invented radio the same week and rolled it out in different parts of the world.
[02:17:43.348 --> 02:17:49.131]  Europe, the United States, other areas, because it's just that level of understanding.
[02:17:49.131 --> 02:17:50.552]  And it's the same thing.
[02:17:50.552 --> 02:17:53.354]  The most horrible things you can imagine, they're doing it.
[02:17:53.354 --> 02:17:55.235]  If you can think of it, they're doing it.
[02:17:55.235 --> 02:17:57.817]  And if they've got a weapon system, they're going to use it.
[02:17:58.885 --> 02:18:03.066]  These people are brazen, they're bold, they're aggressive, they're hyper-dominant.
[02:18:03.066 --> 02:18:06.167]  The most hyper-dominant thing you can do is kill your enemies.
[02:18:06.167 --> 02:18:07.147]  Wipe them out.
[02:18:07.147 --> 02:18:08.427]  Exterminate.
[02:18:08.427 --> 02:18:10.168]  Let's go to Nathan in Oklahoma.
[02:18:10.168 --> 02:18:11.848]  Thanks for holding.
[02:18:11.848 --> 02:18:14.028]  Thanks, Alex, for taking me.
[02:18:14.028 --> 02:18:16.469]  I have a couple, I'll get right to the point.
[02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:17.569]  I have a couple things.
[02:18:17.569 --> 02:18:20.230]  First thing, I'll tell you about the history of my town.
[02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:24.771]  I live in Catoosa, Oklahoma, and within the past couple of months,
[02:18:25.619 --> 02:18:39.752]  We have had a couple of police officers get caught for pushing drugs through the town and also the county clerk or city hall clerk that you know deals with the tickets.
[02:18:39.752 --> 02:18:41.313]  And is that the feds that caught them?
[02:18:41.313 --> 02:18:49.900]  Because when they do that they'll send good feds in to bust them and then bring bad feds in later to consolidate and make sure all the money goes to them.
[02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:53.544]  Right and so that had happened and
[02:18:54.827 --> 02:19:04.452]  So in the Catoosa paper on Wednesday, August 11, 2010, we have a new police chief that is going to be in office on the 28th.
[02:19:04.452 --> 02:19:07.974]  And our mayor, of course, appoints the chief.
[02:19:07.974 --> 02:19:15.717]  And in the paper, our mayor also tells the paper pretty much what they're going to say.
[02:19:15.717 --> 02:19:22.721]  And so in the paper, Mayor Rita Lampkin, she said about this new police chief, he is very qualified.
[02:19:23.630 --> 02:19:34.576]  Um, and then in the paper it says, uh, Nietzsche comes to the position from the Cherokee Nation Enterprises, where he has worked 10 years with security, internal investigation, and audits.
[02:19:34.576 --> 02:19:42.801]  And now, Mayor Schenier has the training and ability to spot illegal activity because he's been watching Alfred on a day-to-day basis at the casino.
[02:19:43.564 --> 02:19:47.510]  And, uh, previously she had wanted nothing to do with the casino.
[02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:51.235]  Yeah, so now you're gonna have casino security heads as your police chief.
[02:19:51.235 --> 02:19:52.857]  The casino gulag economy.
[02:19:52.857 --> 02:19:54.800]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:55.120]  Yes.
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:56.602]  Well, the key word is... Stay there and finish.
[02:19:56.602 --> 02:19:57.003]  Stay there.
[02:19:57.003 --> 02:19:59.907]  We'll be right back with Nathan, Tony, Michael, Joe and others.
[02:19:59.907 --> 02:20:00.307]  We'll be back.
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:03.962]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[02:20:03.962 --> 02:20:12.787]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[02:20:12.787 --> 02:20:25.255]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[02:20:25.255 --> 02:20:26.156]  But don't wait!
[02:20:26.156 --> 02:20:29.138]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[02:20:29.258 --> 02:20:29.578]  I think so.
[02:20:46.414 --> 02:20:48.918]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[02:20:48.918 --> 02:20:50.820]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:50.920]  800-876-2966.
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:51.101]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[02:21:01.089 --> 02:21:02.390]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.390 --> 02:21:07.972]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:21:07.972 --> 02:21:12.994]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:21:12.994 --> 02:21:13.474]  It's true.
[02:21:13.474 --> 02:21:18.016]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:21:18.556 --> 02:21:23.777]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:21:23.777 --> 02:21:30.899]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:21:30.899 --> 02:21:32.019]  And here's the best part.
[02:21:32.019 --> 02:21:38.381]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:21:38.701 --> 02:21:41.882]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:21:41.882 --> 02:21:44.103]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:21:44.103 --> 02:21:45.044]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:21:45.044 --> 02:21:45.244]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:45.244 --> 02:21:48.685]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:21:48.685 --> 02:21:50.426]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:22:08.615 --> 02:22:13.841]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing, and what you can do to prepare.
[02:22:13.841 --> 02:22:27.437]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[02:22:28.178 --> 02:22:33.202]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[02:22:47.134 --> 02:22:48.155]  Or call 800-655-1577.
[02:22:48.155 --> 02:22:50.276]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[02:22:50.276 --> 02:22:50.797]  Fallofamerica.net.
[02:23:00.808 --> 02:23:02.029]  Attention to all U.S.
[02:23:02.029 --> 02:23:09.994]  drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles with an auto warranty about to expire or no warranty coverage at all.
[02:23:09.994 --> 02:23:16.118]  Due to our country's economic crisis and auto repair costs on the rise, if your vehicle has less than 130,000 miles, as of today,
[02:23:18.399 --> 02:23:28.664]  You could be one of the millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle covered under United Repair Plans and have 100% of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you.
[02:23:28.664 --> 02:23:33.347]  This low-cost vehicle service contract has been established under United Repair Plans.
[02:23:33.587 --> 02:23:40.652]  And is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession.
[02:23:40.652 --> 02:23:49.358]  If you own a vehicle with less than 130,000 miles, you may now call to see if your vehicle qualifies and for a free 5-minute quote.
[02:23:49.358 --> 02:23:50.279]  Number to call is 800-809-4491.
[02:23:50.279 --> 02:23:50.339]  800-809-4491.
[02:23:50.339 --> 02:23:50.679]  Again, that's 800-809-4491.
[02:24:16.041 --> 02:24:33.735]  If you look at England, they have many, many more private corporate police that wear police uniforms, but don't have the same powers that go around intimidating people, putting you in databases, asking where you're going.
[02:24:33.735 --> 02:24:35.776]  It's all about training you.
[02:24:35.776 --> 02:24:39.199]  And more and more, they're hiring private security people to be police chiefs.
[02:24:39.199 --> 02:24:40.100]  I've seen this trend.
[02:24:42.208 --> 02:24:48.950]  And so basically they're going to run society, like Max Keiser has said, like a casino.
[02:24:48.950 --> 02:25:02.075]  So you're saying in your town, you're going to have now basically a security pit boss as your police chief keeping you in line and making sure that the house, the government, the parasite system, gets all that juicy blood.
[02:25:03.809 --> 02:25:10.571]  Right, well, like I was reading in the paper, though, it said the key word would be where he works 10 years with security.
[02:25:10.571 --> 02:25:13.331]  Now, anyone in a casino can work with security.
[02:25:13.331 --> 02:25:22.333]  What he actually did in the casino was where he had to go through security to get to the lost and found, which is where he was working, apparently.
[02:25:22.333 --> 02:25:29.155]  And so now, in the detail of the paper, though, this new chief, he says, I have training in homicide and major crime investigations.
[02:25:29.659 --> 02:25:41.249]  Terrorism and street gangs through the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training and also received extensive training through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[02:25:41.249 --> 02:25:53.501]  Yeah, no, the feds are putting anybody in that's a FEMA minion and most of these new police chiefs are sent by this federal council where they promise more federal funds if they appoint who they want.
[02:25:53.501 --> 02:25:54.862]  Almost every police chief
[02:25:56.383 --> 02:25:56.543]  Yes.
[02:26:12.864 --> 02:26:20.289]  And he said that most of the CPS heads and CPS agents are now former Eastern Bloc.
[02:26:20.289 --> 02:26:22.350]  They grew up having government take kids.
[02:26:22.350 --> 02:26:24.011]  They don't even hardly speak English.
[02:26:24.011 --> 02:26:26.393]  They just want the money and they get bonuses for more kids.
[02:26:26.393 --> 02:26:27.894]  So they just come take your kids.
[02:26:27.894 --> 02:26:29.094]  It's foreigners.
[02:26:29.094 --> 02:26:32.677]  I mean, our military's biggest recruiting center is now in Mexico City.
[02:26:33.397 --> 02:26:36.520]  And it's like, here's machine guns, you want to push evil Americans around?
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:37.901]  Have your way with them.
[02:26:37.901 --> 02:26:41.123]  And so the whole thing is being converted over to this.
[02:26:41.123 --> 02:26:42.544]  What's the headline on that article?
[02:26:42.544 --> 02:26:44.406]  I'd like to see it.
[02:26:44.406 --> 02:26:51.011]  The headline on that article is Arneetscher, I think is how you pronounce his name, named police chief.
[02:26:51.011 --> 02:26:52.812]  Arneetscher named police chief.
[02:26:52.812 --> 02:26:54.093]  All right, thank you.
[02:26:54.093 --> 02:26:54.853]  We'll look that up.
[02:26:54.853 --> 02:26:57.055]  What's the name of the paper?
[02:26:57.055 --> 02:26:58.156]  Catoosa Times.
[02:26:58.156 --> 02:26:59.117]  Catoosa Times.
[02:26:59.918 --> 02:27:02.919]  Yeah, Wednesday, August 11th, volume 8, number 18.
[02:27:02.919 --> 02:27:04.560]  Alright, Nathan, thank you.
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:06.040]  Interesting info.
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:08.781]  Hey, you don't like a casino pit boss running your life?
[02:27:08.781 --> 02:27:09.922]  Shut up!
[02:27:09.922 --> 02:27:12.162]  We've got a radiation scanner for you.
[02:27:12.162 --> 02:27:12.883]  It's good for you.
[02:27:12.883 --> 02:27:13.863]  DU's good for you.
[02:27:13.863 --> 02:27:14.663]  Mercury's good.
[02:27:14.663 --> 02:27:15.744]  Shut up and die.
[02:27:15.744 --> 02:27:17.384]  Shut up and lick boots!
[02:27:17.384 --> 02:27:18.144]  You're dominated.
[02:27:18.144 --> 02:27:19.685]  We're pimp slapping you.
[02:27:19.685 --> 02:27:21.126]  Let's talk to Tony in Illinois.
[02:27:21.126 --> 02:27:21.746]  You're on the air.
[02:27:21.746 --> 02:27:23.806]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[02:27:23.806 --> 02:27:25.067]  Hey, I got two comments for you, Alex.
[02:27:25.666 --> 02:27:33.027]  I live downtown Chicago and when Barry Satoro came to Chicago for his birthday or whatever, I had seen a Chicago cop on State Street.
[02:27:33.027 --> 02:27:36.328]  I was walking down State Street and I had my Barry Satoro shirt on and he stopped me.
[02:27:36.328 --> 02:27:39.168]  He said, he shook my hand and said, keep up the good work.
[02:27:39.168 --> 02:27:40.209]  We know what you guys are doing.
[02:27:40.209 --> 02:27:41.989]  We're behind you.
[02:27:41.989 --> 02:27:52.131]  And another thing is, I was watching WGN News on July 14th and they had put something on TV in the health section about drinking fluoridated water with tea and brushing your teeth.
[02:27:52.131 --> 02:27:54.331]  It's good for your teeth and that just like,
[02:27:54.966 --> 02:27:55.847]  I really couldn't take it with that.
[02:27:55.847 --> 02:27:57.788]  When I seen that, I went to City Hall.
[02:27:57.788 --> 02:28:02.272]  Some of my friends tried to go there, you know, try to talk to them, but they weren't trying to hear it.
[02:28:02.272 --> 02:28:05.975]  So, they gave me Alderman's phone number, Alderman's phone number for Chicago.
[02:28:05.975 --> 02:28:07.757]  The Chicago Club gave it to me.
[02:28:07.757 --> 02:28:10.019]  And I've been printing all this stuff out.
[02:28:10.019 --> 02:28:13.842]  We're out handing them out, downtown Chicago, to everybody, the floor, deception.
[02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:15.393]  I got the ultimate numbers.
[02:28:15.393 --> 02:28:19.635]  We got flyers about how poisonous it is, how Berta doesn't help you.
[02:28:19.635 --> 02:28:21.155]  Well, I want to commend listeners.
[02:28:21.155 --> 02:28:33.081]  We've gotten reports all over the country, newscasts, news articles about the flyers we made that people took and posted or they made their own flyers and it's causing a huge debate and just keep doing it forever.
[02:28:33.081 --> 02:28:39.424]  Never stop and know that you are literally going to rip their arm out of their socket like Beowulf to Grendel.
[02:28:39.424 --> 02:28:40.705]  You are just going to will it.
[02:28:40.705 --> 02:28:42.305]  Just go, I've got you by the arm.
[02:28:43.866 --> 02:28:44.386]  We're good to go.
[02:29:05.509 --> 02:29:06.950]  You know, they're bearing down on us.
[02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:08.510]  We're starting to resist, and they're getting scared.
[02:29:08.510 --> 02:29:09.891]  They're going, whoa!
[02:29:09.891 --> 02:29:14.533]  And now they're trying to get out the door, and we've got to grab them by the arm and go, you're not going anywhere.
[02:29:14.533 --> 02:29:17.634]  Just rip their arm out of the socket.
[02:29:17.634 --> 02:29:22.616]  I mean, you've just got to have that just bare knuckles focus and total determination.
[02:29:22.616 --> 02:29:27.339]  You've got to turn your will loose and just feel the will of Infowar.
[02:29:27.339 --> 02:29:27.799]  Banners!
[02:29:28.519 --> 02:29:29.339]  We're on the march.
[02:29:29.339 --> 02:29:30.159]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:31:59.838 --> 02:32:04.401]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.401 --> 02:32:05.322]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.322 --> 02:32:08.745]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:08.745 --> 02:32:09.605]  Number 2.
[02:32:09.605 --> 02:32:14.489]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.489 --> 02:32:15.229]  It's true.
[02:32:15.229 --> 02:32:20.113]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.113 --> 02:32:20.934]  Number 3.
[02:32:20.934 --> 02:32:24.516]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.516 --> 02:32:28.219]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.419 --> 02:32:29.220]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.220 --> 02:32:31.982]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:31.982 --> 02:32:35.666]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:35.666 --> 02:32:36.447]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.447 --> 02:32:40.590]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:45.355]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:45.635 --> 02:32:49.817]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:49.817 --> 02:32:51.598]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.598 --> 02:32:53.840]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:56.481]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:56.481 --> 02:33:08.508]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:08.508 --> 02:33:10.089]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:13.707 --> 02:33:17.650]  All right, I got some key news on the economy coming up.
[02:33:17.650 --> 02:33:21.172]  We're going to get this retired FBI agent on very, very soon.
[02:33:21.172 --> 02:33:24.454]  I've never seen in a four-minute clip somebody boil it all down.
[02:33:24.454 --> 02:33:26.895]  He was there inside the cover-up.
[02:33:26.895 --> 02:33:31.358]  It's now been declassified of one of the hitmen photographed there.
[02:33:31.358 --> 02:33:35.200]  It fits in with E. Howard Hunt's deathbed confession.
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:37.902]  I mean, this guy worked it in Dallas.
[02:33:37.902 --> 02:33:41.684]  This is amazing intel from WJW-TV.
[02:33:42.905 --> 02:33:46.506]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I want to hit on that.
[02:33:46.506 --> 02:33:48.127]  Finish up your points, Tony.
[02:33:48.127 --> 02:33:49.367]  I love to hear your spirit.
[02:33:49.367 --> 02:33:50.868]  It gets me fired up.
[02:33:50.868 --> 02:33:52.709]  Take that action.
[02:33:52.709 --> 02:33:56.630]  Yeah, I'm part of We Are Change Chicago, and this is something that we feel we have to do.
[02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:57.411]  We ain't going to stop.
[02:33:57.411 --> 02:33:59.091]  We're never going to stop, no matter what.
[02:33:59.091 --> 02:34:04.153]  Like, when Barry Tutorial came to Chicago to interview one of my friends, a Fox News reporter, but they didn't play it on TV.
[02:34:04.153 --> 02:34:08.115]  We knew they weren't going to, because he put it out there, basically.
[02:34:08.115 --> 02:34:09.895]  He put it out there that Barry Tutorial was abroad.
[02:34:12.409 --> 02:34:14.090]  It's just like, that point is kind of mutant.
[02:34:14.090 --> 02:34:16.072]  On Google, on Yahoo, that's all up there.
[02:34:16.072 --> 02:34:17.233]  Barry Satoru is all over there.
[02:34:17.233 --> 02:34:21.317]  Even their cell phone search engine, KGB, they even tell you who Barry Satoru is.
[02:34:21.317 --> 02:34:26.421]  So, I am thinking they're going to try to kill him because there's like, pretty much lost effort with him.
[02:34:26.421 --> 02:34:30.604]  But, the sodium fluoride in the water, that's something that we're not going to stop doing.
[02:34:30.604 --> 02:34:32.326]  We're going to keep on doing it no matter what.
[02:34:32.326 --> 02:34:35.388]  No matter what, even if it's only two or three of us, we'll still be standing on the corners.
[02:34:35.388 --> 02:34:35.949]  It doesn't matter.
[02:34:36.553 --> 02:34:37.354]  We're all over downtown.
[02:34:37.354 --> 02:34:42.078]  Anybody in Chicago you want to know about the sodium chloride, you want to do something, I got the Alderman's numbers.
[02:34:42.078 --> 02:34:42.999]  You can call your Alderman.
[02:34:42.999 --> 02:34:45.161]  We're about to have a petition out there.
[02:34:45.161 --> 02:34:45.601]  We'll be out there.
[02:34:45.601 --> 02:34:48.564]  Yeah, give us the We Are Change Chicago point.
[02:34:48.564 --> 02:34:56.050]  Everybody there should join, you know, and you guys are confronting Al Gore, making international news, millions of viewers.
[02:34:56.050 --> 02:35:01.415]  You are kicking hind end of the globalist, so folks should go to the website.
[02:35:02.352 --> 02:35:03.993]  Yeah, we are Change Chicago.
[02:35:03.993 --> 02:35:05.454]  We are Change Chicago meetup page.
[02:35:05.454 --> 02:35:08.116]  You can go there, join up with us, help us out.
[02:35:08.116 --> 02:35:09.116]  We need all your help.
[02:35:09.116 --> 02:35:12.578]  To the Chicago cop that listened to me on Alex Jones Show, we need your help.
[02:35:12.578 --> 02:35:13.759]  Wake your buddies up and tell them that...
[02:35:14.451 --> 02:35:15.732]  They're gonna get you guys, too.
[02:35:15.732 --> 02:35:17.173]  Don't think that you're gonna be safe.
[02:35:17.173 --> 02:35:18.354]  They're gonna get you, too.
[02:35:18.354 --> 02:35:22.436]  They're already getting them with all the poison and getting... It was in the Chicago Tribune.
[02:35:22.436 --> 02:35:24.018]  They're gonna take part of their pension.
[02:35:24.018 --> 02:35:25.879]  They're not gonna stop, people!
[02:35:25.879 --> 02:35:26.759]  It's us or them!
[02:35:26.759 --> 02:35:28.661]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:28.661 --> 02:35:28.761]  Ah!
[02:35:28.761 --> 02:35:30.102]  I love it!
[02:35:30.102 --> 02:35:34.224]  Michael in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:35:34.224 --> 02:35:34.845]  Hello?
[02:35:34.845 --> 02:35:35.445]  Or Michelle.
[02:35:35.445 --> 02:35:40.529]  I keep calling... I keep looking at screens, and every time I see the name Michelle, I call it Michael.
[02:35:40.529 --> 02:35:42.470]  Michelle, go ahead.
[02:35:42.470 --> 02:35:43.030]  Hi, Alex.
[02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.351]  Love you.
[02:35:44.545 --> 02:35:46.405]  I just wanted to touch on a few things.
[02:35:46.405 --> 02:35:48.386]  AmeriCorps.
[02:35:48.386 --> 02:35:50.806]  How much do you know about AmeriCorps?
[02:35:50.806 --> 02:35:59.608]  That is the base, admittedly, of the forced compulsory service they now have in legislation to have giant youth corps, also part of cyber security.
[02:35:59.608 --> 02:36:06.069]  So it's the government bankrupting everything and then forcing most of the youth into government-controlled jobs.
[02:36:06.069 --> 02:36:06.489]  Right.
[02:36:06.489 --> 02:36:09.630]  And I have been online and I've looked at this in my state.
[02:36:10.390 --> 02:36:18.413]  And listed under South Carolina in AmeriCorps, we already have a 10-month full-time residential program for men and women between the ages of 18 and 24.
[02:36:18.413 --> 02:36:26.915]  In exchange for their services, AmeriCorps members earn an education award that can be used to pay for college or to pay back qualified student loans.
[02:36:26.915 --> 02:36:36.218]  And they've got a subdivision called SecureCorps, which going back even 11 years ago, trains them to take on the American people as spies.
[02:36:36.218 --> 02:36:38.079]  It's a CIA recruiting front.
[02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:43.133]  I went in to sign up for this.
[02:36:43.133 --> 02:36:49.417]  It asked me for my social security number, my age, and whether or not I was a veteran.
[02:36:49.417 --> 02:36:57.664]  I am a veteran, and I also fell for this entire 9-11 thing, the H1N1 scare.
[02:36:57.664 --> 02:37:02.247]  I just woke up within the last couple of months, and I am so P.O.'d.
[02:37:02.247 --> 02:37:03.588]  I joined the regulators.
[02:37:03.588 --> 02:37:05.529]  I joined the Tea Party movement.
[02:37:05.529 --> 02:37:07.371]  I've joined the patriotic resistance.
[02:37:07.757 --> 02:37:16.117]  I've been spending my full time on this because I had them shoot up my daughter with poison and when that happened, this was personal.
[02:37:16.721 --> 02:37:18.843]  This became personal for me.
[02:37:18.843 --> 02:37:20.424]  And now I'm checking into this.
[02:37:20.424 --> 02:37:24.647]  What do you think about... Now, I've been asking... Well, Michelle, that's the way.
[02:37:24.647 --> 02:37:34.134]  When they want to microwave you at the checkpoints and the naked body scanners, when they want to put deadly poison in your daughter, they are assaulting you and you're having a normal response.
[02:37:34.134 --> 02:37:38.157]  You're angry, you're focused, and nothing can stop an angry mama.
[02:37:38.157 --> 02:37:41.299]  And I'm telling you, all of us are in this fight together.
[02:37:41.299 --> 02:37:43.661]  But what was your final question?
[02:37:43.661 --> 02:37:44.702]  My final question is,
[02:37:45.799 --> 02:37:48.922]  First of all, I think they're going to put Rick Perry in there.
[02:37:48.922 --> 02:37:53.507]  He's a builder burger and now they've got him fighting Obama in the news as far as the Mexicans go.
[02:37:53.507 --> 02:38:01.214]  But anyway, with UFOs, I've been going on looking at UFOs since about July of this year.
[02:38:01.214 --> 02:38:06.779]  Just really looking at them and they've got the most spectacular pictures we've ever seen in the past 60 years.
[02:38:06.779 --> 02:38:09.322]  I really think that perhaps, I don't know, in 2012,
[02:38:10.731 --> 02:38:25.622]  When the Zion Olympics occur in London, we might have a big UFO thing, but I just want everybody to be really aware that that technology that they've been keeping hidden from us at Area 51 for the past 60 years is going to be coming into use for this false flag technology.
[02:38:25.622 --> 02:38:26.403]  I hear you, Michelle.
[02:38:26.403 --> 02:38:28.925]  I gotta jump, but that's actually declassified.
[02:38:28.925 --> 02:38:30.286]  Project Blue Beam.
[02:38:30.286 --> 02:38:32.167]  Fake alien invasions.
[02:38:32.167 --> 02:38:35.409]  And now mainstream news says Churchill says they're real.
[02:38:35.409 --> 02:38:37.071]  The aliens are coming.
[02:38:37.071 --> 02:38:38.852]  And I believe it's a fraud.
[02:38:40.598 --> 02:38:44.461]  I'm going to get to Joe, Ronnie, Andrew, Delta.
[02:38:44.461 --> 02:38:53.048]  I'll try to get to all of you before the show ends, but I've got a bunch of news I've got to hit on now, and the first thing is the financial news.
[02:38:53.048 --> 02:38:57.792]  Okay?
[02:38:57.792 --> 02:38:59.994]  Let me go ahead and get into this news here.
[02:38:59.994 --> 02:39:03.277]  Morgan Stanley says government defaults inevitable.
[02:39:04.286 --> 02:39:12.132]  Investors will face defaults on government bonds, given the burden of aging populations and the difficulty of securing more tax revenue, according to Morgan Stanley.
[02:39:12.132 --> 02:39:18.097]  The Communist Chinese government saying the same thing.
[02:39:18.097 --> 02:39:18.497]  U.S.
[02:39:18.497 --> 02:39:21.920]  new home sales sink to lowest pace on record.
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:23.821]  New home sales lowest on record.
[02:39:23.821 --> 02:39:27.945]  Existing homes lowest level since 1968.
[02:39:27.945 --> 02:39:30.387]  Durable goods orders rose far less than expected.
[02:39:31.368 --> 02:39:36.110]  Stock market plunged and the Plunge Protection Team came up, pumped it back up to 10,000 a day.
[02:39:36.110 --> 02:39:37.951]  Heck, let's check where it is right now, guys.
[02:39:37.951 --> 02:39:43.254]  Dow faces bouncy ride to 5,000, top strategist tells CNBC.
[02:39:43.254 --> 02:39:45.835]  Economy caught in depression, not recession.
[02:39:45.835 --> 02:39:46.496]  CNBC.
[02:39:48.410 --> 02:39:50.892]  Now, here's a key article from the Economic Collapse.
[02:39:50.892 --> 02:39:51.673]  Excellent blog.
[02:39:51.673 --> 02:39:58.539]  You can link through to the Reserve Accumulation International Monetary Stability Act directly on the IMF's own website.
[02:39:58.539 --> 02:40:00.820]  Understand, this is them saying it.
[02:40:00.820 --> 02:40:02.522]  Now, we told you years ago they're going to be called SDRs.
[02:40:02.522 --> 02:40:05.384]  They're going to be based on SDRs.
[02:40:05.384 --> 02:40:16.594]  This is the global private banks issuing their own fiat, peer-to-peer, computer-to-computer, bank-to-bank digital currency that will be backed up with your carbon taxes.
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:19.741]  Go read this.
[02:40:19.741 --> 02:40:26.145]  A global tax to these private crooks, and they don't care what you think, they're doing it.
[02:40:26.145 --> 02:40:33.789]  And the article goes on, sometimes there are things that are so shocking that you just do not want to report them unless they're completely and totally documented.
[02:40:33.789 --> 02:40:40.493]  Over the past few years, there have been many rumors, no, not rumors, documented fact, about a coming global currency.
[02:40:40.493 --> 02:40:46.396]  But at times, it has been difficult to pin down evidence that plans for such a currency are actually in the works, because you're not going to get a physical one.
[02:40:46.596 --> 02:40:53.258]  You're still going to have your regional currency, just like RealIDx, a global ID card, but it has its local packaging.
[02:40:53.258 --> 02:40:54.658]  It says Texas on it.
[02:40:54.658 --> 02:40:56.158]  It says Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[02:40:56.158 --> 02:40:58.199]  You know, it says New York on it.
[02:40:58.199 --> 02:41:02.200]  They even have it down to the city you live in now, but it's globally standardized.
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:05.800]  It's like they got 12 different versions of Sports Illustrated.
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:08.561]  It's still Sports Illustrated, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:08.561 --> 02:41:12.362]  Okay, so they control your currency and have this global currency above it.
[02:41:14.804 --> 02:41:17.946]  Over the past years, there have been many rumors about a coming global currency.
[02:41:17.946 --> 02:41:22.829]  But at times, it has been difficult to pin down evidence that plans for such a currency are actually in the works.
[02:41:22.829 --> 02:41:23.850]  Not anymore.
[02:41:23.850 --> 02:41:33.677]  A paper entitled, Reserve Accumulation and International Monetary Stability, by the Strategy Policy Review Department of the IMF, recommends that the world adopt a global currency called the Bancor.
[02:41:34.477 --> 02:41:39.761]  Or the Bancor, B-A-N-C-O-R, and that the Global Central Bank be established to administer the currency.
[02:41:39.761 --> 02:41:42.103]  It's already been set up, they've been trading these for years.
[02:41:42.103 --> 02:41:46.487]  The report is dated April 13th, 2010, and a full copy can be read here.
[02:41:46.487 --> 02:41:49.489]  Unfortunately, this is not hype and it's not rumor.
[02:41:49.489 --> 02:41:58.036]  This is very, it's a serious proposal and it's an official document from one of the mega-powerful institutions that is actually running the world economy.
[02:41:58.036 --> 02:41:58.537]  And it goes on.
[02:41:59.653 --> 02:42:00.994]  Continuing here.
[02:42:00.994 --> 02:42:02.956]  Ron Paul calls for audit of U.S.
[02:42:02.956 --> 02:42:03.656]  gold reserves.
[02:42:03.656 --> 02:42:05.198]  Kitco exclusive.
[02:42:05.198 --> 02:42:06.499]  He did an interview with them and said...
[02:42:07.813 --> 02:42:08.974]  The gold is missing.
[02:42:08.974 --> 02:42:10.115]  They won't say where it is.
[02:42:10.115 --> 02:42:15.620]  He's going to call for Congress to demand an audit and then watch the bankers say, oh, we don't want to look at the gold.
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:16.801]  Don't look at the gold.
[02:42:16.801 --> 02:42:18.263]  That'll further expose them.
[02:42:18.263 --> 02:42:24.729]  Even though their puppet Congress won't pass the audit, if they tried to, they'd probably detonate a nuke or something and say, Ron Paul done it.
[02:42:24.729 --> 02:42:25.830]  I mean, you know, I'm not kidding.
[02:42:25.830 --> 02:42:26.450]  These are criminals.
[02:42:26.450 --> 02:42:33.437]  These are hardcore crooks who are relying on completing their swindle by putting in a hardcore police state to suppress you.
[02:42:34.884 --> 02:42:45.272]  All right, I want to get into JFK and a few other key tidbits, but I wanted to briefly, for about four minutes, bring Ted Anderson up, because gold rocketed 50-plus dollars.
[02:42:45.272 --> 02:42:46.973]  The globalists tried to drive it down.
[02:42:46.973 --> 02:42:49.315]  It rocketed right back up this week.
[02:42:49.315 --> 02:42:51.797]  And I haven't even asked Ted, but I wanted to get him on and ask him on air.
[02:42:51.797 --> 02:42:53.478]  I sent him a text message.
[02:42:53.478 --> 02:42:54.719]  He said, sure, he'd come on.
[02:42:54.719 --> 02:42:58.622]  The owner of Genesis, the owner of Midas Resources, the most trusted name in precious metals.
[02:43:00.267 --> 02:43:01.708]  He's got the best deals out there.
[02:43:01.708 --> 02:43:10.692]  I don't even know if he can still offer that smoking deal he had last week or if he ran out, but all his deals are always very, very competitive, and he can deliver it right to you.
[02:43:10.692 --> 02:43:15.034]  Most other companies aren't even 30 years in the business, so they can't even hold on to good deals.
[02:43:15.034 --> 02:43:18.616]  You're paying major premiums, not with Ted, with these radio specials.
[02:43:18.616 --> 02:43:20.457]  I can guarantee you these are smoking deals.
[02:43:20.457 --> 02:43:28.641]  Ted, with all this happening in the economy, give us your breakdown with the stock market gyrating wildly on a roller coaster ride, and tell us about today's offers.
[02:43:29.522 --> 02:43:30.062]  Yeah, sure.
[02:43:30.062 --> 02:43:38.285]  Well, that Morgan Stanley article that you brought up was one of the ones that I had highlighted for me to talk about, so I'm glad you took the wind out of my sails on that one.
[02:43:38.285 --> 02:43:45.387]  They're just talking about the United States defaulting on the government debt, and they're not saying it like it could happen.
[02:43:45.387 --> 02:43:47.548]  They're saying that the defaults are inevitable.
[02:43:48.268 --> 02:44:00.411]  And that means that the interest rates here in the United States are going to go up, we're going to lose our AAA rating and our bonds, and it's just going to be incredibly crushing to the budget at Congress.
[02:44:00.411 --> 02:44:09.294]  And that's exactly what that CBO document that I was talking about, Alex, that Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document, if people don't have that,
[02:44:09.714 --> 02:44:11.415]  They need to read this document.
[02:44:11.415 --> 02:44:13.035]  They can't avoid reading it.
[02:44:13.035 --> 02:44:14.076]  They have to.
[02:44:14.076 --> 02:44:17.117]  And you have to give it to every family member that you have.
[02:44:17.117 --> 02:44:25.039]  And if you haven't picked it up on the internet yet, call us right here at 800-686-2237 because we'll send it out.
[02:44:25.039 --> 02:44:28.060]  And Ted, let me interrupt.
[02:44:28.060 --> 02:44:34.982]  You've been a sponsor and supporter of this radio show for now almost 14 years, or it is 14 years.
[02:44:34.982 --> 02:44:36.223]  I mean, I got syndicated with you.
[02:44:37.430 --> 02:44:45.572]  And everything you talked about, everything Ron Paul talked about, everything our experts talked about, everything I talked about, because we were diagnosing it.
[02:44:45.572 --> 02:44:48.593]  The derivatives were designed to do this.
[02:44:48.593 --> 02:44:51.193]  It's a black hole, impossible to pay off.
[02:44:51.193 --> 02:44:53.514]  It gives them all the power, us nothing.
[02:44:53.514 --> 02:45:02.516]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if you ever let private banks control the issuance of currency and credit, your children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[02:45:02.516 --> 02:45:03.656]  We are now here.
[02:45:04.176 --> 02:45:09.360]  We must get out of this system, not pay this foreign false debt, or we're dead.
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:11.061]  It's designed to roll us.
[02:45:11.061 --> 02:45:12.923]  It's designed to rob us.
[02:45:12.923 --> 02:45:14.063]  We're being shanghaied.
[02:45:14.063 --> 02:45:15.705]  We're being robbed.
[02:45:15.705 --> 02:45:21.629]  We're being bamboozled, hoodwinked, financially raped, going into financial bondage.
[02:45:21.629 --> 02:45:23.010]  I want to say it again.
[02:45:23.010 --> 02:45:25.412]  We told you eight years ago gold was going to go up.
[02:45:25.852 --> 02:45:30.395]  It's gone up over $1,000 from where it was, or right at $1,000 from where it was.
[02:45:30.395 --> 02:45:35.699]  We told you all of this, and now exactly what we told you is all over the news!
[02:45:35.699 --> 02:45:37.540]  It's all over the news!
[02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:41.383]  And I'm telling you, people need to get into gold and silver.
[02:45:41.383 --> 02:45:47.267]  It's not perfect, but it's the best thing there is, ladies and gentlemen, and you're nuts if you don't take advantage of this.
[02:45:47.267 --> 02:45:48.068]  Ted, tell them the offer.
[02:45:48.368 --> 02:45:50.690]  Yeah, I mean, right now we do have the Franks.
[02:45:50.690 --> 02:45:52.572]  They're sitting at 270.
[02:45:52.572 --> 02:45:54.093]  We have the British Sovereigns.
[02:45:54.093 --> 02:45:55.594]  They're at 340.
[02:45:55.594 --> 02:46:02.940]  I still have, even though silver has gone up almost to $19 an ounce now, I still have the walking Liberty Halves at 924.
[02:46:04.201 --> 02:46:07.003]  That is just an absolute steal.
[02:46:07.003 --> 02:46:11.906]  On the internet, the francs have gone up to $274 right now.
[02:46:11.906 --> 02:46:13.807]  I have them at $270.
[02:46:13.807 --> 02:46:19.912]  And I'm still giving away that full year subscription to Bob Chapman's International Forecaster newsletter.
[02:46:19.912 --> 02:46:23.154]  But if you're not looking for gold and silver, fine.
[02:46:23.154 --> 02:46:28.177]  At least get a copy of that Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document.
[02:46:28.177 --> 02:46:30.599]  It came out of Congress, for God's sakes.
[02:46:30.599 --> 02:46:33.941]  And they're the ones who are saying that we're going to run into this crash.
[02:46:34.321 --> 02:46:34.941]  Absolutely.
[02:46:34.941 --> 02:46:38.823]  Ted, can you still offer last week's deal or do you run out of those francs?
[02:46:38.823 --> 02:46:41.424]  I don't have that on the franc.
[02:46:41.424 --> 02:46:45.445]  Alex, they're only $5 more, but they're $10 more in the marketplace.
[02:46:45.445 --> 02:46:48.667]  So I still have them reduced in price.
[02:46:48.667 --> 02:46:51.848]  But people need to get motivated and they need to take...
[02:46:52.248 --> 02:46:56.770]  Take action at this point.
[02:46:56.770 --> 02:46:57.710]  800-686-2237.
[02:46:57.710 --> 02:46:58.350]  800-686-2237.
[02:46:58.350 --> 02:46:59.811]  Here's the article.
[02:46:59.811 --> 02:47:03.192]  Morgan Stanley says government default is inevitable.
[02:47:03.192 --> 02:47:04.392]  This was designed.
[02:47:04.392 --> 02:47:11.935]  Now the very globalists that engineered this are posing as the saviors, forecasting what they themselves have engineered.
[02:47:11.935 --> 02:47:11.995]  800-686-2237.
[02:47:11.995 --> 02:47:12.035]  800-686-2237.
[02:47:17.697 --> 02:47:18.878]  Yeah, thanks for having me up Alex.
[02:47:39.403 --> 02:47:44.408]  Now, we're getting him on very, very soon, and we won't have time to play the whole clip.
[02:47:44.408 --> 02:47:45.569]  It's just so amazing.
[02:47:45.569 --> 02:47:47.311]  It's a four and a half minute clip.
[02:47:47.311 --> 02:47:50.314]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:47:50.314 --> 02:47:53.978]  This guy was in the inside, witnessed it all, the first part of the newscast.
[02:47:53.978 --> 02:47:57.141]  They don't even cover that.
[02:47:57.141 --> 02:48:02.206]  He also talks about the common sense of how it was impossible the way he say he got assassinated.
[02:48:03.922 --> 02:48:05.183]  The cover-up he witnessed.
[02:48:05.183 --> 02:48:06.804]  I mean, this is bombshell.
[02:48:06.804 --> 02:48:09.525]  This is bombshell what this FBI agent is saying.
[02:48:09.525 --> 02:48:12.106]  Let's play part of this clip going to break, and I'll come back and comment on it.
[02:48:12.106 --> 02:48:16.529]  Here it is.
[02:48:16.529 --> 02:48:16.869]  63.
[02:48:16.869 --> 02:48:20.070]  President John F. Kennedy is gunned down in Dallas.
[02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:25.253]  Officially, Lee Harvey Oswald fired the fatal shots from the Texas Book Depository.
[02:48:25.253 --> 02:48:28.455]  But now, a local man's got history in the crosshairs.
[02:48:30.660 --> 02:48:34.182]  Did Lee Harvey Oswald kill President John F. Kennedy?
[02:48:34.182 --> 02:48:35.462]  No.
[02:48:35.462 --> 02:48:36.983]  Had nothing to do with it.
[02:48:36.983 --> 02:48:46.287]  Former FBI agent Don Adams from Summit County says thousands of national archives prove... The Warren Commission was nothing but a bunch of liars.
[02:48:46.287 --> 02:48:50.449]  The Korean War veteran entered the FBI September 1962.
[02:48:50.449 --> 02:48:55.911]  He was assigned to Thomasville, Georgia, where he began investigating a man named Joseph Adams Miltier.
[02:48:56.662 --> 02:48:59.443]  He was reported to be one of the most violent men in the country.
[02:48:59.443 --> 02:49:06.205]  A friend of Miltier's, William Somerset, who was also an FBI informant, said Miltier was threatening JFK.
[02:49:06.205 --> 02:49:12.607]  And Somerset was telling him that he was really radical, and he was saying bad things about what they wanted to do to Kennedy.
[02:49:12.607 --> 02:49:19.369]  Agent Adams completed the Miltier investigation, and a week later, shots rang out in Dallas.
[02:49:19.369 --> 02:49:22.510]  There appears to have been something has happened in the motorcade booth.
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:27.661]  It devastated me and I thought to myself, what did I do wrong?
[02:49:27.661 --> 02:49:30.041]  His boss said, find Miltier.
[02:49:30.041 --> 02:49:31.622]  I said goodbye to my partner.
[02:49:31.622 --> 02:49:36.403]  He never said a word to me about anything about Miltier that he knew him or anything.
[02:49:36.403 --> 02:49:45.004]  Many years later, Don learned that agents contacted his partner who told them Miltier was in Georgia, essentially eliminating him as a suspect.
[02:49:45.004 --> 02:49:48.605]  And that shocked me when I saw that document because I knew it was an outright lie.
[02:49:49.312 --> 02:49:57.935]  Then, when Adams finally captured Miltier days later, he says his supervisor prohibited him from conducting a proper interrogation.
[02:49:57.935 --> 02:50:01.756]  Miltier was released, and Agent Adams transferred.
[02:50:01.756 --> 02:50:03.457]  And where did I go but to Dallas, Texas?
[02:50:04.881 --> 02:50:08.123]  He remembers seeing this Obruder film for the very first time.
[02:50:08.123 --> 02:50:11.926]  And all of a sudden I saw the President go like this with his hands.
[02:50:11.926 --> 02:50:12.806]  And I said, how?
[02:50:12.806 --> 02:50:15.088]  And I said, he was shot in the throat.
[02:50:15.088 --> 02:50:18.751]  The minute that you have a frontal shot, Oswald can't be the shooter.
[02:50:18.751 --> 02:50:21.252]  Because this came from the grassy knoll.
[02:50:21.252 --> 02:50:23.574]  And Oswald was in Texas School Book Depository.
[02:50:24.195 --> 02:50:29.700]  The Warrant Commission said three shots were fired, but Don counted 11.
[02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:43.574]  The agent said to me, Don, be careful what you say and how you say it because the Warrant Commission is here and they've already ruled that Oswald is the shooter and there were no shots from the front.
[02:50:44.246 --> 02:50:49.328]  The Army veteran wondered how Oswald fired three shots in seven and a half seconds with a bolt-action rifle.
[02:50:49.328 --> 02:50:50.789]  Alright folks, we're about to come back.
[02:50:50.789 --> 02:50:52.169]  The key part is coming up.
[02:50:52.169 --> 02:50:54.951]  We're gonna finish this clip when we come back.
[02:50:54.951 --> 02:50:57.172]  Because it really gets amazing on the other side.
[02:50:57.172 --> 02:50:59.553]  This all concurs with our research.
[02:50:59.553 --> 02:50:59.933]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.221 --> 02:51:01.801]  Attention!
[02:51:01.801 --> 02:51:06.803]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[02:51:06.803 --> 02:51:12.505]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[02:51:12.505 --> 02:51:19.648]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:51:19.648 --> 02:51:28.411]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:51:29.611 --> 02:51:32.754]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:51:32.754 --> 02:51:39.601]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:51:39.601 --> 02:51:48.390]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:53.232]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.

[02:51:53.312 --> 02:51:53.372]  800-902-6969.
[02:51:53.372 --> 02:51:53.552]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[02:52:05.672 --> 02:52:06.933]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:06.933 --> 02:52:10.634]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.634 --> 02:52:13.076]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:13.076 --> 02:52:18.958]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:18.958 --> 02:52:25.641]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.641 --> 02:52:31.624]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.624 --> 02:52:35.326]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:52:35.786 --> 02:52:40.070]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:46.034]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:46.034 --> 02:52:49.577]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.577 --> 02:52:51.558]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.558 --> 02:52:52.679]  It's here.

[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:52.741]  Okay, final segment, ladies and gentlemen, for this hour.
[02:54:08.370 --> 02:54:10.371]  We got some very surprising guests tomorrow.
[02:54:10.371 --> 02:54:12.051]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:54:12.051 --> 02:54:15.092]  Retired FBI agent says Oswald didn't kill Kennedy.
[02:54:15.092 --> 02:54:16.713]  WJW television.
[02:54:16.713 --> 02:54:21.214]  A retired FBI agent from Summit County is making claims regarding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
[02:54:21.214 --> 02:54:23.315]  They go beyond conspiracy theories.
[02:54:23.315 --> 02:54:24.395]  It's not been conspiracy.
[02:54:24.395 --> 02:54:25.556]  It's been fact.
[02:54:25.556 --> 02:54:29.417]  Congress found in 79 that it was a conspiracy.
[02:54:30.410 --> 02:54:42.773]  Don Adams speaking clearly and concisely when describing the events of November 22nd, 1963, the day President Kennedy was killed, and he doesn't waver from his position that Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill President John F. Kennedy in Dallas.
[02:54:42.773 --> 02:54:46.614]  In fact, says Adams, he says he has the FBI documents to prove it.
[02:54:46.614 --> 02:54:47.854]  Let's finish up with this clip.
[02:54:47.854 --> 02:54:52.075]  Here it is.
[02:54:52.075 --> 02:54:59.237]  Because the Warrant Commission is here, and they've already ruled that Oswald is the shooter, and there were no shots from the front.
[02:54:59.909 --> 02:55:07.098]  The Army veteran wondered how Oswald fired three shots in seven and a half seconds from a bolt-action rifle.
[02:55:07.098 --> 02:55:08.880]  I'm gonna tell you something right now, guys.
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:13.526]  There's no way in the world Oswald shot that weapon, and boy, I mean, I was really cautioned then.
[02:55:13.976 --> 02:55:26.182]  Don eventually retired from the FBI never thinking twice about Miltier until 1992 when he saw a picture in this book which he says positively places Miltier in Dallas the day of the shooting.
[02:55:26.182 --> 02:55:31.725]  Joseph Adams Miltier looking at the presidential car moments before the president was killed.
[02:55:32.145 --> 02:55:40.748]  At the National Archives and Records Administration, Don found many reports missing or manipulated, including his file on Miltier from 1963.
[02:55:40.748 --> 02:55:43.149]  Everything that I had done was gone.
[02:55:43.149 --> 02:55:44.370]  Everything was gone.
[02:55:44.370 --> 02:55:56.115]  But the most startling discovery was a tape recording, captured by Miami intelligence officers, November 9th, 1963, just weeks before Dallas.
[02:55:56.115 --> 02:55:59.236]  Miltier is talking to the informant, William Somerset.
[02:56:11.572 --> 02:56:15.915]  The FBI headquarters and Secret Service both had that tape within days.
[02:56:15.915 --> 02:56:18.617]  I should have stopped the President from traveling instantly.
[02:56:19.212 --> 02:56:20.473]  But they didn't.
[02:56:20.473 --> 02:56:22.495]  And he says he was jubilant.
[02:56:22.495 --> 02:56:23.936]  Bragging to Somerset.
[02:56:23.936 --> 02:56:28.540]  You thought I was kidding when I said he would be killed from a window with a high-powered rifle.
[02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:34.165]  Despite all of that, Miltier was never even mentioned in the Warren Commission report.
[02:56:34.165 --> 02:56:40.671]  When Hoover set up the propaganda in the FBI, don't embarrass the FBI, that was his rules.
[02:56:40.671 --> 02:56:41.552]  And you didn't.
[02:56:41.552 --> 02:56:45.215]  So they ordered everything put into the archives and to be forgotten about it.
[02:56:45.515 --> 02:56:50.757]  But Don can't forget, and hopes something is done before the truth is buried forever.
[02:56:50.757 --> 02:56:56.480]  I mean, when we die off, when we're gone, there's not gonna be anybody who's gonna sit here and tell you these things.
[02:56:56.480 --> 02:56:59.381]  I hope the truth gets told, whatever it is.
[02:57:02.071 --> 02:57:03.452]  All right, folks.
[02:57:03.452 --> 02:57:17.683]  We're going to be interviewing him very soon, but the issue is we have the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt, CIA Black Op commander, for assassination of leaders worldwide.
[02:57:17.683 --> 02:57:22.307]  And he had come out in court hearings before, was involved in Dallas.
[02:57:22.307 --> 02:57:23.848]  He denied it.
[02:57:23.848 --> 02:57:24.769]  But when he went public,
[02:57:26.209 --> 02:57:28.010]  It was planned in Miami.
[02:57:28.010 --> 02:57:30.130]  They were going to kill him in Chicago.
[02:57:30.130 --> 02:57:33.411]  A black Secret Service agent blew the whistle so they couldn't do it.
[02:57:33.411 --> 02:57:35.372]  They killed him in Dallas.
[02:57:35.372 --> 02:57:50.156]  And I've interviewed the widow, the, well, they were all basically common law married, but the mistress, longtime mistress of LBJ, who was on record to be her, his,
[02:57:52.884 --> 02:57:53.884]  Mistress?
[02:57:53.884 --> 02:58:00.607]  Point is, I always at the end of the show try to frustratedly get all this data out and then I kind of seize up because there's so much of it.
[02:58:00.607 --> 02:58:04.088]  The point is, they killed him dead in a hammer.
[02:58:04.088 --> 02:58:05.269]  They did it in plain view.
[02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:07.409]  I mean, they shot him from the front.
[02:58:07.409 --> 02:58:09.190]  You can see the blood and him shot in the neck.
[02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:11.371]  Then they blow the top of his head off.
[02:58:11.371 --> 02:58:13.812]  And the Dallas doctor said he'd been shot in the neck.
[02:58:16.038 --> 02:58:18.500]  And all the witnesses saw the plumes of smoke.
[02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:21.741]  And they killed the witnesses that saw the men at the grassy knoll with the rifles.
[02:58:21.741 --> 02:58:24.123]  Boom, boom, boom!
[02:58:24.123 --> 02:58:28.425]  We even know who all the assassins were that were there.
[02:58:28.425 --> 02:58:30.187]  Corsican hitmen, you name it.
[02:58:30.187 --> 02:58:32.428]  Because the CIA likes to be able to deny.
[02:58:32.428 --> 02:58:33.248]  They had hitmen.
[02:58:33.248 --> 02:58:34.149]  They had mafia.
[02:58:34.149 --> 02:58:35.450]  They had white supremacists.
[02:58:35.450 --> 02:58:36.831]  They had anti-communists.
[02:58:36.831 --> 02:58:38.091]  They had hit teams everywhere.
[02:58:38.091 --> 02:58:38.672]  And the U.S.
[02:58:38.672 --> 02:58:40.673]  Army down the street ready to kill Kennedy if he got away.
