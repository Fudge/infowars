[00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:07.113]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:10.719]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:22.993]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:26.255]  It is Sunday, the fifth day of September 2010.
[00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:36.338]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast in full living video color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:46.442]  Today I am going to open a first salvo in an investigation
[00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:59.086]  of the neocons and the Republican Party who are set to be sweeped back into the House and probably the Senate in November of this year in only two months.
[00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:15.056]  We're also going to look at the falling fortunes of the Democrats who have shown themselves to be cohorts with the globalists yet again in their attempt to collectivize this nation.
[00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:36.078]  Now, about two weeks ago, I started getting calls and seeing reviews saying that Glenn Beck's new New York Times bestselling book, The Overton Window, was important for me to read, and I've now had a chance to read it.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.402]  And Glenn Beck is even more dangerous than I had first thought.
[00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:44.384]  This is extremely sophisticated.
[00:01:46.645 --> 00:02:04.610]  And is the equivalent of O'Brien, the inner party torture master, in 1984 telling Winston Smith, one of the inner party propagandists, giving him a book revealing the entire program of enslavement and dehumanization.
[00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.011]  And then arresting Winston and torturing him for reading the book that they gave him.
[00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.532]  This is a revelation of the method
[00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:17.585]  And I'm going to be covering that later in this hour.
[00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:22.547]  Now, it integrates into Machete.
[00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:30.749]  Robert Rodriguez's new film, number two at the box office this weekend, opened on Friday.
[00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.612]  And it was even worse than what the initial script stated.
[00:02:37.012 --> 00:02:39.372]  It is that script, word for word and more.
[00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:43.434]  Robert Rodriguez is a liar.
[00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:50.757]  He lied and said the Arizona trailer for the movie three months ago had nothing to do with the film, wasn't in the film.
[00:02:51.057 --> 00:02:51.778]  That's not true.
[00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:55.079]  He said that they'd cut the race war stuff.
[00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.400]  No, they even added more.
[00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:06.524]  And it deals with how the globalists are controlling our society by manipulating both sides in the false debate.
[00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:13.307]  News Corp, that owns Fox News, produced this movie and has released it.
[00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.851]  On the other end, they've got Glenn Beck.
[00:03:18.572 --> 00:03:20.754]  This is how they control the system.
[00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:22.655]  They control both ends of the spectrum.
[00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:26.318]  And Glenn Beck, in his book, goes as far as to admit that.
[00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:36.727]  This is mind control so sophisticated that it even staggers my mind.
[00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:39.269]  I study this 24-7 and I understand it.
[00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:43.175]  It's hard to articulate, though.
[00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:50.199]  The most sophisticated propaganda PR minds in the world have developed this system, and Beck admits it all.
[00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:57.823]  Carol Quigley, Bernays, Goebbels.
[00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:04.867]  When you've studied propaganda, it's horrifying to watch it unfold.
[00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:08.549]  The Democratic and Republican parties work for the exact same groups.
[00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:18.769]  And it's the globalists playing different populations off against each other in divide and conquer.
[00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.031]  But divide and conquer is just a term.
[00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:24.193]  It goes so much further than just that.
[00:04:24.213 --> 00:04:25.855]  So this is going to be a very important broadcast.
[00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:29.798]  I'm going to hit on a bunch of other news first, and then also get into machete.
[00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.865]  And then we will get into Beck.
[00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:40.588]  Because the Republicans are going to take power.
[00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:54.002]  And if you hold your breath and look for things to really change, you're gonna exfisciate.
[00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:56.966]  You're going to be smothered.
[00:04:57.647 --> 00:04:58.509]  Exfixiate.
[00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:13.754]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:18.419]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:19.437 --> 00:05:31.430]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:39.479]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:49.748]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:05:50.528 --> 00:05:53.791]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:57.654]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:04.439]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.062]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:18.251 --> 00:06:19.972]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:22.796]  It is Sunday, the 5th day of September, 2010.
[00:06:23.336 --> 00:06:31.366]  We're gonna go over the latest economic news, world news, police state news.
[00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:48.615]  Google is being investigated for antitrust by the state of Texas for reportedly manipulating their search function towards their sponsors, which the state of Texas claims is a violation of the Antitrust Act.
[00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:51.679]  Well, of course they manipulate their search functions.
[00:06:51.699 --> 00:07:02.495]  They routinely, in one of our stories at the top, search, delete it, and admit that they're deleting it, and block entire articles we write at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:04.357]  Of course Google is doing this.
[00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:13.631]  There's also a new campaign out with television ads pointing out the fact that Google is a CIA NSA front.
[00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:18.814]  They now admit that, violating your 4th and 5th Amendment, spying on everything.
[00:07:19.434 --> 00:07:22.536]  So we're going to be discussing that as well today.
[00:07:22.956 --> 00:07:26.558]  The cynical term, don't be evil, is a joke.
[00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:34.783]  Their slogan, their maxim of don't be evil is a stinking joke.
[00:07:37.052 --> 00:07:42.175]  I'm not going to really talk about Machete anymore after today.
[00:07:44.156 --> 00:08:02.705]  The reason I've discussed it is I was contacted, it's the number two film at the box office right now, I was contacted three months ago by Hispanic members of Texas filmmaker Robert Rodriguez's crew, who said they were afraid it would reflect badly on Hispanic Americans.
[00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:25.378]  I was then sent the script, because I went on television and the radio, and I said, this Arizona trailer says we have a message to Arizona, and then it shows Hispanic gunmen shooting Texas politicians at the Texas Capitol, shot in front of the Texas Capitol, with state of Texas funding.
[00:08:30.154 --> 00:08:35.238]  Then, Rodriguez and others came out and said, this is ridiculous, none of that's in the movie.
[00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:39.421]  So then I got the actual script from one of our Hollywood sources.
[00:08:40.931 --> 00:09:01.215]  And Rodriguez's ex-wife, who's also the producer on the film, she came out in the Austin American Statesman, UPI, Reuters, literally hundreds of publications in the last two weeks and said that Mr. Jones does not have the script, and it's not true, and he's just saying he has it, and none of what he says is in the movie is in it.
[00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:07.236]  Well, I took six of the crew Friday night to see it, and it is the exact script
[00:09:07.896 --> 00:09:10.619]  It had the name of his agent on it.
[00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:17.885]  I got it from a Hollywood source, who I know, and it was confirmed.
[00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:21.348]  I also got it from other anonymous sources, so I got it from multiple sources.
[00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:27.914]  But I got it from a source I know in Hollywood, and I went to the movie and it was word for word the script.
[00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:34.219]  So, Robert Rodriguez and his ex-wife have played everybody for fools.
[00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:41.186]  Because they don't want the 18% of the budget.
[00:09:42.226 --> 00:09:43.486]  That's what Texas is going to pay them.
[00:09:43.526 --> 00:09:49.809]  Rick Perry, we have the video clip, called it a few months ago, the model of the Texas Film Commission program.
[00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.930]  The governor, Rick Perry.
[00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:58.072]  Now, there's a state law that the films can't get these incentives if it, quote, puts Texas in a bad light.
[00:09:58.373 --> 00:09:58.793]  Let me see.
[00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:03.195]  The movie opens, and the script opens, and the film's now out there.
[00:10:03.215 --> 00:10:04.015]  Anybody can go see it.
[00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:06.379]  I don't recommend you do.
[00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:09.141]  It's one of the worst movies production-wise I've ever seen.
[00:10:09.161 --> 00:10:12.303]  I know that's the style, but I felt dirty when I left.
[00:10:14.184 --> 00:10:17.887]  Like my brain had been hacked on with a machete.
[00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:28.044]  The film opens with Don Johnson playing the part of the Minutemen.
[00:10:28.104 --> 00:10:29.945]  Now, the Minutemen have never killed anybody.
[00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:33.067]  The Minutemen have never killed any Hispanic children.
[00:10:33.107 --> 00:10:34.508]  It's actually the Mexican Coyotes.
[00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:42.233]  Last week, they killed 72 people, many times including children, mainly Central and South American immigrants that come in.
[00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:44.815]  If they don't have extra money at the Texas border, they're murdered.
[00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:46.256]  They're tortured.
[00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:48.998]  Their heads are chopped off with machetes.
[00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:50.579]  And Rodriguez knows that.
[00:10:52.108 --> 00:10:59.104]  This is a whole drug culture, radical Mexican supremacist culture dealing with these machetes.
[00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:16.628]  And so, a week and a half ago, 72 men, women, and children had their heads chopped off in Mexico, 80 miles from the Texas border, not by Minutemen, but by the Mexican cartels that are in complete control of many of the regional governments.
[00:11:17.188 --> 00:11:20.849]  The news admitted it was Los Zetas, quote, former Mexican military.
[00:11:20.869 --> 00:11:22.729]  It's kind of like former CIA.
[00:11:23.089 --> 00:11:23.830]  No such animal.
[00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:30.231]  The movie opens with a group of about 25 illegals dumped out near the border.
[00:11:31.465 --> 00:11:53.151]  Texans pull up in cowboy hats, so if you wear a cowboy hat you're evil, and the Mexicans get on their knees, they blow the heads off of Mexican children one after the other, while a state senator, wearing the cowboy hat and the suit, basically looks like Rick Perry, makes a pregnant Mexican illegal get on her knees,
[00:11:54.349 --> 00:12:00.212]  And she says, I'm pregnant, and they go, good, we want to kill your little, evil, stinking, and they use racial terms, baby.
[00:12:00.692 --> 00:12:03.613]  And they shoot her in the guts, blowing the baby out onto the ground.
[00:12:04.193 --> 00:12:07.495]  And then they go, oh my gosh, this is wonderful, we've killed another one of their babies.
[00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:17.179]  Now, in World War I, the British ran propaganda ads in newspapers showing Germans bayonetting babies.
[00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:17.999]  It wasn't true.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.320]  With a dead baby on the end of a bayonet.
[00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:23.582]  And in history class,
[00:12:25.097 --> 00:12:29.713]  Just basic college history, I was taught about this being the most base form of propaganda.
[00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:34.322]  And the entire movie is Mexican children being murdered.
[00:12:35.062 --> 00:12:40.643]  The entire movie is Catholic priests being crucified by white people screaming racist things.
[00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:44.784]  You couldn't have a film that puts Texas in a worse light.
[00:12:45.084 --> 00:12:57.527]  And anybody who doesn't want a wide open border with crime pouring across it, with Mexico in full collapse, with our country going bankrupt, Bloomberg reporting 46 states on the verge of bankruptcy are already bankrupt,
[00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:04.486]  If you want any border control, you want to murder pregnant women.
[00:13:04.986 --> 00:13:07.169]  The worst thing you can do, societally.
[00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.831]  None of it's true.
[00:13:10.553 --> 00:13:14.798]  And it shows the Coyotes as good guys in the movie, part of a secret network.
[00:13:14.838 --> 00:13:15.599]  And let me tell you something.
[00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:21.476]  My old office was down off of Mary Street and First Street, where the real network is based in Austin.
[00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:40.168]  With the coyotes, with the law firms that help the illegals, Vicente Fox came to Texas five years ago and gave the state of Texas, Austin Police Department, and Wells Fargo an award for violating federal and state law and for not arresting illegals who don't have IDs.
[00:13:41.048 --> 00:13:42.069]  Illegals are above the law.
[00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:51.892]  So there is a network of this, and it's the coyotes, it's the money launderers, it's the banks.
[00:13:52.273 --> 00:14:00.502]  That was also in Reuters in Bloomberg last week, where major banks have pled guilty to actually financing the coyotes and the drug lords.
[00:14:02.773 --> 00:14:10.682]  But in this movie, there's a secret network that's basically going to overthrow Texas and quote, resettle the Southwest.
[00:14:10.722 --> 00:14:13.245]  So it's La Reconquista, Reconquer.
[00:14:14.126 --> 00:14:19.413]  And Fox News had a headline, the La Reconquista is on.
[00:14:21.314 --> 00:14:29.416]  I searched the term machete last night and saw a Fox News piece about a TV piece they did called the Lurie Conquista is here.
[00:14:29.656 --> 00:14:31.156]  Guys, Google that for me under news.
[00:14:31.176 --> 00:14:35.617]  I want to show it to folks who are watching our radio show simulcast at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:14:36.537 --> 00:14:42.159]  But what Fox didn't tell you in the piece is News Corp is putting this movie out.
[00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:47.840]  So of course Rick Perry is going to pay for 18% of the budget with taxpayer money.
[00:14:49.707 --> 00:14:51.189]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:14:53.672 --> 00:14:55.875]  I want to live in peace with everybody.
[00:14:57.797 --> 00:15:00.400]  I want to get along with everyone.
[00:15:02.923 --> 00:15:03.824]  I want to live in peace.
[00:15:04.525 --> 00:15:07.809]  But the big mega-corporations that control and run this nation
[00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:13.071]  They want to divide and conquer our country, and we have the North American Union documents.
[00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.992]  We have the SPP documents.
[00:15:15.272 --> 00:15:26.338]  Judicial Watch sued three years ago and got them, where they've had meetings in Canada, in Banff, and in Waco, with the corporate leaders behind closed doors, setting up the end of borders.
[00:15:27.439 --> 00:15:28.519]  There's the Fox News article.
[00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:29.680]  The Larry Conquista is here.
[00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:40.064]  And they want to break down the borders, drive down the wages, and use the illegal alien voting bloc as a political weapon.
[00:15:40.324 --> 00:15:41.865]  And both parties are involved.
[00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:46.628]  So, Robert Rodriguez is a liar.
[00:15:46.948 --> 00:15:48.169]  We did have the real script.
[00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:50.891]  The Arizona trailer is the film and more.
[00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:54.173]  And they even call it Helter Skelter, which means race war.
[00:15:54.473 --> 00:15:56.174]  Charlie Manson quotes in the film.
[00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:57.695]  This is pure evil.

[00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.351]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:03.501]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:17:03.821 --> 00:17:04.442]  Number one.
[00:17:04.742 --> 00:17:07.884]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:08.745]  Number two.
[00:17:09.025 --> 00:17:13.569]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:14.369]  It's true.
[00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:19.233]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:20.093]  Number three.
[00:17:20.354 --> 00:17:23.656]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:17:23.956 --> 00:17:27.639]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.400]  Number 4.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.002]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:17:31.402 --> 00:17:34.785]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:35.085 --> 00:17:35.626]  Number 5.
[00:17:35.886 --> 00:17:39.789]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.794]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:17:45.074 --> 00:17:49.075]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.776]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:51.016 --> 00:17:53.097]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:17:56.097 --> 00:18:03.100]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:09.362]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:13.623]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[00:18:13.803 --> 00:18:16.805]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:18:17.105 --> 00:18:21.668]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:30.473]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:34.375]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:18:34.895 --> 00:18:41.078]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:18:41.658 --> 00:18:45.060]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:20:00.471 --> 00:20:01.631]  Coast to Coast.
[00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:03.432]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.072 --> 00:20:07.273]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:12.068 --> 00:20:15.030]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:19.834]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:23.597]  Okay, so let's cut right to the chase.
[00:20:24.698 --> 00:20:30.322]  George W. Bush tried four times to legalize at least 30 million illegal aliens in this country.
[00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:32.543]  They lied and said it was 14 million.
[00:20:33.604 --> 00:20:36.006]  But all the major think tanks say between 25 and 35 million.
[00:20:38.632 --> 00:20:42.313]  Now Obama has tried to pass the exact same legislation.
[00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:44.514]  Remember the last time Bush did it in 2008?
[00:20:44.594 --> 00:20:47.454]  The Republicans with the Democrats?
[00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:52.376]  They said, we're not going to let the legislation be public, but we promise you it's not amnesty.
[00:20:52.696 --> 00:20:58.417]  Then Senator Sessions, a good senator, said, I don't care if I get sanctioned by the Senate.
[00:20:58.937 --> 00:20:59.938]  He played chicken with them.
[00:20:59.978 --> 00:21:00.838]  They didn't sanction him.
[00:21:01.478 --> 00:21:02.819]  But he broke their orders.
[00:21:02.879 --> 00:21:05.159]  They shouldn't be able to order an elected representative around.
[00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:06.520]  He has free speech.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.780]  He released the bill.
[00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:10.702]  And it was worse than amnesty.
[00:21:10.742 --> 00:21:15.804]  It said aggravated felons could sign a pledge and be given citizenship.
[00:21:17.585 --> 00:21:23.688]  We have a key article up at Infowars.com titled, Bill and Linda Gates Foundation gave millions to La Raza.
[00:21:24.068 --> 00:21:25.049]  What does Raza mean?
[00:21:25.109 --> 00:21:26.189]  It means the race.
[00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.290]  What is their public slogan?
[00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:31.372]  For those inside the race, everything.
[00:21:31.632 --> 00:21:33.193]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:21:35.282 --> 00:21:36.704]  Billions of dollars.
[00:21:37.044 --> 00:21:40.449]  Over two billion dollars in the last decade.
[00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.473]  It's billions before that, given by the Ford Foundation.
[00:21:43.493 --> 00:21:44.795]  It has more than 40 billion total.
[00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:52.266]  To Mecha and La Raza and others to teach Hispanic children in Mexico, in Latin America, where this movie is now airing.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.562]  With bloody posters of a machete that says everybody for machete.
[00:21:57.342 --> 00:22:01.984]  To hate the United States, the Republicans and the Democrats, the big foundations.
[00:22:02.124 --> 00:22:03.145]  Why do they want this?
[00:22:03.545 --> 00:22:17.733]  They want to bring in a group of people who are hard-working and good, but fill them full of racial hatred and turn them into a political arm, and then Republicans stand back and go, oh my gosh, it's the Democrats that are running Mecha and La Raza.
[00:22:18.493 --> 00:22:21.154]  Oh my gosh, it's the Democrats that want carbon taxes!
[00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:22.274]  Oh really?
[00:22:22.314 --> 00:22:29.716]  Coming up, I'm going to play a News Corp internal video release that was shown to all News Corp employees.
[00:22:30.337 --> 00:22:43.081]  This is an internal News Corp promotional that they then later themselves put out publicly where the CEO of Fox Entertainment brags and shows all the pro-man-made global warming stuff they're pushing.
[00:22:43.321 --> 00:22:44.401]  And who's funding Machete?
[00:22:45.418 --> 00:22:50.824]  Well, go pull it up on IMDB, News Corp, Fox.
[00:22:52.386 --> 00:22:57.832]  See, master corporations control both ends of the political spectrum.
[00:22:58.012 --> 00:23:00.255]  And that way, no matter where you run, they control you.
[00:23:00.876 --> 00:23:01.637]  You think they want
[00:23:02.745 --> 00:23:07.169]  Caucasians and Hispanics, who by the way are European, do you think they want us getting along?
[00:23:07.189 --> 00:23:12.974]  Do you think they want Hispanics coming here and becoming pro-George Washington, pro-Second Amendment, pro-free market?
[00:23:13.054 --> 00:23:13.295]  No.
[00:23:13.895 --> 00:23:17.298]  They force-feed them in the colleges and the public schools.
[00:23:17.579 --> 00:23:18.680]  La Reconquista.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.622]  And then the state of Texas funds up to 18%
[00:23:23.584 --> 00:23:37.147]  Of the funding of this movie, Machete, with your taxpayer money, when it shows Texas politicians as murdering, drug-dealing criminals, murdering pregnant Hispanic women.
[00:23:37.647 --> 00:23:38.568]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:23:38.808 --> 00:23:51.691]  When the state of Texas denies funding to films like Waco, because they said it put Texas in a bad light, last year they denied and said, don't make your film in our state, you won't get tax incentives, so they went to Louisiana.
[00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:56.684]  And Rick Perry's office three months ago, we called them.
[00:23:56.724 --> 00:23:57.925]  No, actually, they contacted us.
[00:23:57.965 --> 00:24:02.430]  His press secretary contacted us and said, Mr. Jones, we're not funding that film.
[00:24:02.851 --> 00:24:05.073]  We'd already called their office and they said, yes, we are funding it.
[00:24:05.273 --> 00:24:12.982]  Then we found the video clip of Rick Perry saying, Robert Rodriguez and his film Machete is the model of the Texas Film Commission.
[00:24:13.282 --> 00:24:14.484]  He is the model.
[00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:22.045]  See, Rick Perry's all hat and no cattle, and I'm not saying vote for white folks.
[00:24:22.346 --> 00:24:23.668]  He's just as bad or worse.
[00:24:24.068 --> 00:24:29.097]  The point is, let me read to you from Glenn Beck's new book, Glenn Beck, The Overton Window.
[00:24:31.063 --> 00:24:32.924]  15 years ago on air I read this quote.
[00:24:33.024 --> 00:24:37.046]  I've read this quote every month on air for my 15 years on air.
[00:24:37.287 --> 00:24:39.828]  It's in a 900 page book called Tragedy and Hope.
[00:24:40.328 --> 00:24:44.510]  He was allowed into the CIA State Department archives in 1962 to 1967.
[00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:48.773]  He published the book a year later, Tragedy and Hope.
[00:24:49.273 --> 00:24:53.095]  And Glenn Beck quotes it right here in his faction book.
[00:24:53.115 --> 00:24:55.036]  He calls it fiction that's fact.
[00:24:57.142 --> 00:24:59.544]  This is Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor.
[00:24:59.884 --> 00:25:06.749]  The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideas and policies is a foolish idea.
[00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:17.117]  Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy.
[00:25:17.417 --> 00:25:22.481]  Then it should be possible to replace it every four years if necessary by the other party, which will be none other
[00:25:23.843 --> 00:25:25.885]  of the things but still pursue.
[00:25:26.425 --> 00:25:26.705]  Again.
[00:25:27.506 --> 00:25:38.415]  Then it should be possible to replace it every four years if necessary by the other party which will be none of these things but will still pursue with new vigor approximately the same basic policies.
[00:25:38.756 --> 00:25:39.556]  Tragedy and hope. 1968.
[00:25:41.929 --> 00:25:57.203]  This was commissioned, 1,000 copies were commissioned by the CIA about themselves to give to their highest level operatives to be able to understand the takedown of America.
[00:25:57.403 --> 00:26:04.469]  Because the CIA openly works for offshore banks, the ones that have stolen $28 trillion in bailout money.
[00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.072]  Again, Bloomberg AP, not $887 billion.
[00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.730]  And what is this book?
[00:26:11.251 --> 00:26:15.953]  This book literally shook me to my core, the Overton window.
[00:26:18.014 --> 00:26:31.120]  Beck in this book admits the government stages terror attacks, wants to set off nukes for martial law, and the character that represents him is this evil operative who poses as a patriot.
[00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:43.476]  And then when he finally becomes a real patriot, they grab him, the CIA grabs him, and gives him electroshock therapy, and then put him back out on television to control conservatives and patriots.
[00:26:43.897 --> 00:26:45.518]  I mean, they just throw it in your face.
[00:26:46.374 --> 00:26:47.394]  In a faction book.
[00:26:48.075 --> 00:26:53.757]  Meanwhile, Beck says you're the scum of the earth if you question the Gulf of Tonkin, which they admit was staged to get us into Vietnam.
[00:26:54.077 --> 00:26:56.058]  You're the scum of the earth if you question 7-7.
[00:26:56.618 --> 00:26:57.658]  And you're dangerous.
[00:26:58.178 --> 00:27:05.441]  And you may be violent if you point out the government-ran drills at the exact same time, at the exact same places, of the bombings.
[00:27:05.721 --> 00:27:07.182]  We had an actuary done.
[00:27:07.422 --> 00:27:12.464]  It was, what was it, one chance out of twenty-three trechtigillion?
[00:27:13.524 --> 00:27:17.288]  That's tens of trillions of times more than all the sand in all the world?
[00:27:17.708 --> 00:27:18.469]  Impossible!
[00:27:18.709 --> 00:27:19.530]  Why do they run drills?
[00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:27.097]  Because if one government group gets caught planting the bombs, they tell the other government group that's good, the white side, oh, we were just part of the drill.
[00:27:27.698 --> 00:27:30.140]  They ran drills, a bomb in the World Trade Center in 93.
[00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:34.564]  New York Times admitted the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, let it go forward.
[00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:37.848]  That's in this book, but it's nukes bombing L.A.
[00:27:39.642 --> 00:27:43.924]  And then he gives newspaper articles about government-staged terror in the end.
[00:27:45.124 --> 00:27:50.866]  While on the air, he says you're a piece of un-American garbage if you talk about it.
[00:27:51.607 --> 00:27:56.168]  I mean, you talk about mind control, ladies and gentlemen, I don't even know what to think of this.
[00:27:57.249 --> 00:28:02.191]  You think I'm happy to get up on the air and talk about government-sponsored terror?
[00:28:03.834 --> 00:28:10.597]  Ten years ago, I was offered Glenn Beck's job before Glenn Beck existed.
[00:28:10.817 --> 00:28:13.218]  He's only been a Patriot radio host for eight years.
[00:28:13.618 --> 00:28:15.619]  I was told, you'll be the next Rush Limbaugh!
[00:28:16.979 --> 00:28:18.720]  You'll be on national television!
[00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:21.601]  You're more powerful than Limbaugh!
[00:28:22.061 --> 00:28:23.502]  People say, well why don't you say who told you that?
[00:28:23.522 --> 00:28:28.244]  When people say in confidence, you agree, you don't violate that confidence.
[00:28:32.042 --> 00:28:34.964]  I mean, you do notice they're doing nightline perspectives on me.
[00:28:35.224 --> 00:28:43.169]  You do notice that they admitted my websites, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, on Alexa and all the other trackers, Dwarf Limbaugh and Beck.
[00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:43.790]  They know this.
[00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.631]  So they are the counterfeits.
[00:28:46.272 --> 00:28:49.033]  Beck was developed to counter Alex Jones.
[00:28:49.053 --> 00:28:49.654]  We'll be back.
[00:28:59.554 --> 00:29:02.316]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:29:02.696 --> 00:29:06.219]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:29:06.499 --> 00:29:09.141]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:29:09.381 --> 00:29:14.305]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:29:14.745 --> 00:29:20.368]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:29:20.688 --> 00:29:26.031]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.

[00:30:59.241 --> 00:31:03.484]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:03.804 --> 00:31:04.065]  Number 1.
[00:31:04.705 --> 00:31:07.867]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.128 --> 00:31:08.708]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.008 --> 00:31:13.552]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:13.892 --> 00:31:14.332]  It's true.
[00:31:14.632 --> 00:31:19.196]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.516 --> 00:31:20.036]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.337 --> 00:31:23.619]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:27.622]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:27.822 --> 00:31:28.363]  Number 4.
[00:31:28.623 --> 00:31:30.985]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.386 --> 00:31:34.769]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:35.270]  Number 5.
[00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.775]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:39.995 --> 00:31:44.760]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:57.950]  Thank you.
[00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:01.672]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:02.032 --> 00:33:03.473]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.093 --> 00:33:07.294]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:10.691 --> 00:33:14.673]  Welcome back to quantify what I was getting into earlier.
[00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:45.143]  On two separate occasions, and on several other lesser occasions, smaller networks, I was approached, and I was told, yes, there's a global government forming, but it's for the good of the planet to redistribute wealth, and I pointed out, no, it's not.
[00:33:45.163 --> 00:33:47.064]  That's what low-level people are told.
[00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:51.068]  We want you to have the biggest national show in the country.
[00:33:52.449 --> 00:34:11.174]  Again, I was approached by the number one and number two consecutive largest syndicators at the time, and they said, look, you come out of the radio, you grab people, you have an intellect, you've studied history, we've done focus groups on you, you will be the next Rush Limbaugh.
[00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:19.655]  I said, well, where do I sign on the dotted line?
[00:34:19.695 --> 00:34:20.915]  They said, well, here's the problem.
[00:34:21.575 --> 00:34:26.156]  No more black helicopters, no more private Federal Reserve, no more world government.
[00:34:26.296 --> 00:34:32.618]  We want you to be a conservative libertarian host, a little more cutting edge than Rush Limbaugh, but there will be editorial control.
[00:34:32.978 --> 00:34:35.039]  You will cover what we say.
[00:34:37.499 --> 00:34:38.499]  And I said, no, thank you.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.260]  And at the time, it was
[00:34:43.076 --> 00:34:45.097]  10, 15 times what I was making money-wise.
[00:34:45.357 --> 00:34:47.417]  The next offer was probably 30 times.
[00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:49.458]  I don't remember all the exact ratios.
[00:34:49.498 --> 00:34:54.560]  The point is, it was a lot of money, a lot of power, the book deals, everything.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.481]  And, of course, they probably had 15, 20 people they were looking at developing.
[00:35:00.642 --> 00:35:06.684]  You know, they tell all those beautiful young women out West or in Connecticut or wherever, come out to California and you'll be a movie star.
[00:35:07.124 --> 00:35:10.225]  And five years later, they're a crack-addicted, you know, porn star.
[00:35:11.272 --> 00:35:16.654]  So, they had a lot of people they were out there farming and looking for to be Glenn Beck.
[00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:18.835]  Somebody they could control.
[00:35:19.556 --> 00:35:26.679]  So, you got News Corp, and I'm going to play this clip coming up, admitting that they promote the global warming fraud.
[00:35:26.719 --> 00:35:28.079]  They've got O'Reilly doing it.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.661]  They've got the big globalist Newt Gingrich promoting global warming taxes.
[00:35:32.021 --> 00:35:34.002]  They've got Pat Robertson out promoting it.
[00:35:34.982 --> 00:35:37.484]  Now that it's imploded, thanks to the
[00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:46.955]  Information being leaked internally, how it was a fraud, and this show and others, and Ron Paul, and the Climate Depot, and many others, it's in a lot of trouble now.
[00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:48.716]  And Al Gore's been discredited.
[00:35:49.756 --> 00:35:57.660]  But just a year ago, you saw a neoconservative push, along with Barack H. Obama, to give you the global tax.
[00:36:02.383 --> 00:36:07.746]  And only a few of the Fox hosts were even allowed to talk about it, but most of them were pushing it like it was real.
[00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.573]  But what did Glenn Beck write just a week and a half ago?
[00:36:12.833 --> 00:36:16.618]  Glenn Beck, key Obama ally, works with socialists for global tax.
[00:36:17.158 --> 00:36:21.804]  Well why doesn't, and this is from glennbeck.com, why doesn't Glenn talk about Rupert Murdoch?
[00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:24.588]  Why doesn't Glenn discuss that?
[00:36:24.648 --> 00:36:28.753]  No, see, what they're doing is, when the Democrats were out of power,
[00:36:32.998 --> 00:36:41.620]  When the Democrats weren't in office, Keith Olbermann and others played the part of anti-Patriot Act, anti-police state, anti-surveillance.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.381]  Now they're in power, they're all for it.
[00:36:43.961 --> 00:36:45.481]  Now Republicans are out of power.
[00:36:45.801 --> 00:36:49.842]  Oh, they're against the tyranny, they're against the corruption, they're against all the problems.
[00:36:50.242 --> 00:36:56.224]  Oh, when law enforcement last year sent this radio show, We Broke It, the MIAC report and Homeland Security reports,
[00:36:57.639 --> 00:37:00.340]  The media picked up on it and said Obama had issued that.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.241]  Well, yes, Obama had reissued it.
[00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:12.165]  Turned out a year before, George W. Bush had issued those reports, saying that homeland security was really for conservatives, gun owners, libertarians.
[00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:27.564]  And we've gotten similar reports during those years, but it never made national news because, oh no, the neocon TV and radio, they didn't want to talk about Bush and the people that controlled him setting up homeland security for the American people.
[00:37:27.785 --> 00:37:31.746]  Remember, it was the Republicans that were for the banker bailouts, along with the Democrats.
[00:37:32.206 --> 00:37:40.890]  It was Bill Clinton, with the help of Republican votes, in 1990s, who got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999.
[00:37:44.312 --> 00:37:48.393]  And it was the same Bush advisors that went into the Obama administration.
[00:37:48.854 --> 00:37:56.696]  So, all that's happening is the Republicans are playing the part of the anti-establishment right now.
[00:37:57.397 --> 00:38:05.819]  And I do agree with Republicans' views and their state platforms, like the state of Texas, and I tend to side with them more.
[00:38:05.879 --> 00:38:07.140]  The grassroots are great people.
[00:38:08.151 --> 00:38:13.513]  But the leadership is in bed with the very same people.
[00:38:14.434 --> 00:38:16.594]  And that's the issue that you have to understand.
[00:38:16.775 --> 00:38:20.036]  I mean, how can Glenn Beck write a book he calls faction?
[00:38:20.936 --> 00:38:21.937]  Fiction that's fact.
[00:38:22.977 --> 00:38:29.460]  Say this book is real, at the beginning, and at the end have a 30-something page glossary.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.041]  Give me a document cam shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:38:33.462 --> 00:38:52.185]  He has a big lengthy thing of news articles and quotes by Edward Bernays, Carol Quigley, he's got all the articles about drills on 7-7 with the London bombings at the exact same time, exact same place, eugenics, how they want to sterilize you, one-child policies, it's all there!
[00:38:55.416 --> 00:39:03.419]  It's all there, but it's a fiction book, and then I've got clips of him saying, there's no one I hate more than 9-11 victims' families.
[00:39:03.859 --> 00:39:08.401]  They're a bunch of scum, because a bunch of them think we've been lied to about 9-11.
[00:39:08.421 --> 00:39:09.741]  Well, we know!
[00:39:10.021 --> 00:39:12.242]  The Commission said the official story's a lie!
[00:39:13.769 --> 00:39:21.836]  Beck talks about how it's private global corporations that have infiltrated the CIA and FBI that staged the terror and that most of the agents don't know.
[00:39:22.036 --> 00:39:22.737]  That's true too.
[00:39:23.377 --> 00:39:27.581]  I'm not even really saying our government staged these attacks or allowed these attacks to take place.
[00:39:29.022 --> 00:39:36.466]  The point is that we have newscasts with them saying, getting back, we're going to blow up Building 7, that 47-story building.
[00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.908]  And I'm supposed to just see that and not talk about it?
[00:39:39.728 --> 00:39:45.752]  Or CIA drills of the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon being attacked by airplanes that morning?
[00:39:46.312 --> 00:39:49.154]  And the NORAD tapes and the FAA tapes where they're saying,
[00:39:51.857 --> 00:39:53.758]  Why are all these blips being put on my screens?
[00:39:53.838 --> 00:39:59.382]  Why are there drills of the same thing happening while it's happening so that the Pentagon got confused and stood down?
[00:40:00.583 --> 00:40:01.664]  Just like 7-7.
[00:40:02.204 --> 00:40:06.267]  Just like 1993, Bill Clinton bombing the World Trade Centers.
[00:40:06.887 --> 00:40:07.828]  Bill Clinton's controllers.
[00:40:09.636 --> 00:40:12.818]  Bill Clinton, I mean, it's in the New York Times and CBS News.
[00:40:13.098 --> 00:40:21.582]  It came out in federal court that the FBI hired Ahmad Salam, had him build a real bomb, and then he said, now run the sting and bust them, they're gonna do it in three days, the bomb's built.
[00:40:21.802 --> 00:40:23.784]  And they said, no, we're letting it go forward.
[00:40:23.984 --> 00:40:30.547]  And Ahmad Salam, who worked for the CIA, knew they were setting him up and recorded more than 10 hours of it.
[00:40:32.068 --> 00:40:33.529]  Because they were gonna set him up!
[00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:35.590]  He gave a press conference with the tape!
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.601]  The tape's now been released by the federal government.
[00:40:39.841 --> 00:40:42.762]  It's in the latest film we produced, Invisible Empire.
[00:40:42.982 --> 00:40:45.943]  The clips of him with the FBI!
[00:40:46.904 --> 00:40:48.605]  And Glenn Beck writes a book about it!
[00:40:49.585 --> 00:40:54.467]  And says it's all real, but then I'm bad because I'm talking about it.
[00:40:55.867 --> 00:40:57.288]  Now, why is this being done?
[00:40:58.746 --> 00:41:08.074]  Do you remember 10, 15, 20 years ago, national talk show host would say the CFR, the Council on Foreign Relations, doesn't even exist.
[00:41:08.814 --> 00:41:09.915]  It was totally secret then.
[00:41:10.216 --> 00:41:11.477]  Now it's public all over TV.
[00:41:12.077 --> 00:41:15.540]  It once opened borders, North American Union, NAFTAGAT, all this stuff.
[00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:17.422]  They wrote the Homeland Security Act.
[00:41:17.462 --> 00:41:21.085]  They write the major legislation that deals with the takeover.
[00:41:22.665 --> 00:41:24.025]  And it's a kook detector!
[00:41:24.085 --> 00:41:24.826]  You're a nut!
[00:41:24.926 --> 00:41:27.186]  You're a lunatic if you've read Carol Quigley's book!
[00:41:27.446 --> 00:41:30.327]  You're a lunatic if you've read CIA declassified documents!
[00:41:30.587 --> 00:41:36.469]  You're a lunatic if you've read the declassified REX 84 FEMA camp plans, which Beck admits in this book!
[00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:42.951]  He said they don't exist, and then in the book he admits it, and then has... I mean, this is insane.
[00:41:43.871 --> 00:41:44.631]  Why are they doing this?
[00:41:44.651 --> 00:41:45.691]  Because they've caved in.
[00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:47.552]  And this is the best news I could bring you.
[00:41:48.715 --> 00:41:57.902]  For decades, they tried to pacify libertarians, conservatives, researchers, Americans that were smart enough to not be controlled by the mind control, the disinformation, and the propaganda.
[00:41:58.142 --> 00:41:59.503]  They told you it didn't exist.
[00:41:59.823 --> 00:42:01.805]  And the last three years, that stopped working.
[00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:07.326]  And they had to admit they're setting up a bank of the world, carbon taxes to finance it.
[00:42:07.386 --> 00:42:11.189]  IMF two weeks ago said the new Bancor will be the new global digital currency.
[00:42:11.389 --> 00:42:15.572]  You'll still have your local currency, but it'll be pegged and controlled by that global currency.
[00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.494]  They can't deny this anymore.
[00:42:17.714 --> 00:42:18.574]  We're now here.
[00:42:19.055 --> 00:42:26.200]  They've now bankrupted us, as the IMF and World Bank plans from the mid-90s stated they would do, leaked in 2002, given to the BBC.
[00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:31.650]  How did I know they were going to bankrupt us years before they did it?
[00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:32.590]  Using derivatives?
[00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:33.911]  I had their battle plan!
[00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:36.512]  Good people in government leaked this stuff!
[00:42:36.712 --> 00:42:38.952]  People always say, well, if all this was true, we'd know.
[00:42:39.673 --> 00:42:40.253]  Well, we do!
[00:42:40.693 --> 00:42:42.334]  Just the media would never cover it here.
[00:42:42.934 --> 00:42:46.635]  So, all these years they tried to pacify you and said it didn't exist.
[00:42:47.275 --> 00:42:56.679]  Now, because it's out in the open, they've got to pose as the patriots, come in and admit a little bit of it, till they get back into power, sharing power with the Democrats.
[00:42:59.502 --> 00:43:02.245]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:43:02.626 --> 00:43:06.150]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.074]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:43:09.314 --> 00:43:14.240]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:43:30.833 --> 00:43:38.960]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.

[00:44:56.537 --> 00:44:58.278]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:45:01.007 --> 00:45:02.649]  And you're subject to public police action.
[00:45:03.489 --> 00:45:04.410]  Tyranny is here.
[00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.294]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:45:08.534 --> 00:45:10.896]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:45:10.916 --> 00:45:16.301]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:45:16.761 --> 00:45:23.044]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:45:23.445 --> 00:45:28.988]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:45:29.408 --> 00:45:33.110]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:37.572]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:45:37.873 --> 00:45:43.796]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:45:43.816 --> 00:45:46.978]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:45:47.378 --> 00:45:48.799]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:49.839]  It's here.

[00:45:59.164 --> 00:46:03.107]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:46:03.367 --> 00:46:09.391]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:46:09.772 --> 00:46:16.857]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:46:17.157 --> 00:46:21.740]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.563]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at
[00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:29.086]  We're good to go.
[00:47:00.507 --> 00:47:01.668]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:02.028 --> 00:47:03.409]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:07.393]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:07.413 --> 00:47:19.864]  This is our land.
[00:47:20.284 --> 00:47:24.728]  These are our people.
[00:47:27.537 --> 00:47:28.278]  The workers.
[00:47:28.298 --> 00:47:31.340]  The strivers.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.121]  The builders.
[00:47:34.082 --> 00:47:37.505]  These are our people.
[00:47:37.565 --> 00:47:38.606]  Who are they?
[00:47:40.908 --> 00:47:42.810]  They are the Dark Armies.
[00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.533]  The dark, murdering armies whose only honour
[00:47:47.389 --> 00:47:48.389]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:50.470]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:06.795 --> 00:48:11.056]  I want to give the phone number out and take calls and cover other important news in the next hour.
[00:48:11.116 --> 00:48:13.277]  The toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2244.
[00:48:13.297 --> 00:48:13.397]  888-201-2244.
[00:48:13.477 --> 00:48:16.858]  Gets you up and on the air on this live September 5th, Sunday edition.
[00:48:22.256 --> 00:48:32.709]  Now, before I go any further, I want to finish up with what I was talking about with Machete and Fox News Corp funding this race war division film.
[00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:37.715]  At the same time, Fox is criticizing it basically to hype it and to promote it.
[00:48:38.637 --> 00:48:39.257]  It's incredible.
[00:48:40.103 --> 00:48:42.024]  And they need to tell their viewers that they're doing this.
[00:48:42.744 --> 00:48:52.388]  But separately, you've got News Corp, one of the biggest pushers in their movies, their TV shows, their radio shows, of global carbon taxes.
[00:48:52.749 --> 00:48:56.610]  Bill O'Reilly, all of these people pushing it.
[00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.352]  But at the same time, they then control the movement against it.
[00:49:01.332 --> 00:49:04.174]  That way they can defeat it at key junctures.
[00:49:04.654 --> 00:49:06.835]  And notice, Glenn Beck supported the banker bailout bill.
[00:49:07.625 --> 00:49:14.874]  Glenn Beck, of course, over and over again, has supported the Patriot Act, now being used against citizens in non-terror-related cases.
[00:49:15.094 --> 00:49:23.604]  He now controls a value-added tax, something the globalists want, something that got introduced right now, but they're going to keep that along with the income tax.
[00:49:24.165 --> 00:49:26.848]  And so my issue is, they get your confidence,
[00:49:28.167 --> 00:49:33.294]  And then they basically sell you down the river, just like Obama did on the controlled left.
[00:49:33.915 --> 00:49:34.996]  And Beck understands this.
[00:49:35.537 --> 00:49:42.246]  He put Carol Quigley in his book, his new book, The Overton Window, the argument that the two political parties
[00:49:42.927 --> 00:49:42.987]  Yes.
[00:50:03.712 --> 00:50:09.878]  You know, getting rid of the tyranny, but will still pursue with the new vigor approximately the very same basic policies.
[00:50:10.538 --> 00:50:13.601]  So Beck is telling you that he's an insider.
[00:50:13.821 --> 00:50:14.422]  He goes on.
[00:50:15.082 --> 00:50:17.545]  The popular will cannot be taken for granted.
[00:50:17.565 --> 00:50:18.826]  It must be created.
[00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:21.008]  It must be manufactured.
[00:50:23.433 --> 00:50:28.176]  A year and a half ago, Republicans were being booed at public events along with the Democrats.
[00:50:28.516 --> 00:50:37.901]  So they made rebellion only about the Tea Party, then had the Republicans come in with the Tea Party Express and Dick Armey and finance the whole thing and take that over.
[00:50:38.561 --> 00:50:40.342]  The same rhetoric.
[00:50:40.382 --> 00:50:41.683]  A lot of truth is being told.
[00:50:42.143 --> 00:50:49.727]  But as soon as they get in power, they're going to sabotage it just like Mr. Global Warming Tax, Newt Gingrich, who wants that globalist tax.
[00:50:50.796 --> 00:50:53.579]  Just like he took over the 1994 revolution.
[00:50:54.339 --> 00:50:58.343]  There are a lot of good candidates running as Republicans all over this country.
[00:50:58.924 --> 00:51:08.113]  And when they are good, like Rand Paul, you see the Republican establishment and Dick Cheney come after Rand Paul when he was running against the establishment Republican.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.301]  In the primaries.
[00:51:11.021 --> 00:51:23.071]  So I'm telling you folks, we're in a fight for the heart and soul of this country, and we've got to hold Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and others' feet to the fire and say, look, Alex Jones and Ron Paul and others were right.
[00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:24.372]  There is a global government.
[00:51:24.572 --> 00:51:25.553]  It is run by banks.
[00:51:25.573 --> 00:51:26.753]  There are carbon taxes.
[00:51:27.134 --> 00:51:28.275]  All of this is being set up.
[00:51:28.575 --> 00:51:37.502]  They denied that for all those years, and now that they couldn't suppress you learning the truth because of my work and many others' work and my listeners' work,
[00:51:37.982 --> 00:51:40.104]  Now they're coming out going, okay, some of it's real.
[00:51:40.124 --> 00:51:44.007]  I mean, there's quotes in here about the Bilderberg Group, world government, everything.
[00:51:44.547 --> 00:51:47.109]  But then on their shows, they make fun of it.
[00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:52.531]  But they're being forced to tell the truth more and more.
[00:51:52.992 --> 00:52:03.998]  We are winning, ladies and gentlemen, but remember that when the Republicans get back in power, don't be so in love with them and hating the Democrats so much that you don't hold their feet to the fire.
[00:52:04.658 --> 00:52:13.604]  Don't be so in love with their propaganda, just like Bill Clinton supporters wouldn't wake up when I try to talk to them and talk sense into them about him being a liar and corrupt.
[00:52:14.304 --> 00:52:20.588]  Because they had invested in him as being their daddy, their friend, their master, their helper.
[00:52:21.969 --> 00:52:26.712]  And now you've invested in George W. Bush, and you find out he's just a puppet.
[00:52:26.933 --> 00:52:31.736]  So then people invest in Obama, and they won't wake up when he's conning them and pimping them.
[00:52:33.257 --> 00:52:42.764]  Now, I got a lot of evidence on this front, but if you want to find the video of this, just search the term Fox admits to planting political brainwashing in popular TV shows.
[00:52:43.124 --> 00:52:50.850]  This is News Corp showing clips of TV and movies where they promote global warming and global taxes to the population.
[00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:54.332]  But then separately, they've got Fox News where they're fighting it.
[00:52:54.613 --> 00:52:57.595]  It's all part of their business model to control the opposition.
[00:52:58.706 --> 00:52:59.046]  Okay?
[00:52:59.806 --> 00:53:01.327]  Now, let's go ahead and play this short clip.
[00:53:01.527 --> 00:53:07.549]  Here is News Corp with one of their executives telling you that they're promoting global carbon taxes.
[00:53:07.569 --> 00:53:07.949]  Here it is.
[00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:25.674]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[00:53:28.157 --> 00:53:28.937]  Global warming.
[00:53:29.218 --> 00:53:29.758]  Probably.
[00:53:30.058 --> 00:53:34.380]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[00:53:36.321 --> 00:53:38.922]  Three years is a long ways away.
[00:53:39.022 --> 00:53:43.224]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[00:53:43.984 --> 00:53:44.885]  Just had another thought.
[00:53:46.207 --> 00:53:49.408]  What if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to it?
[00:53:49.568 --> 00:53:57.491]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content.
[00:53:57.731 --> 00:53:58.351]  I don't follow.
[00:53:59.011 --> 00:53:59.532]  Green!
[00:53:59.612 --> 00:54:01.352]  It means environmentally friendly.
[00:54:01.412 --> 00:54:08.755]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows and we would accomplish nothing if we compromised that quality.
[00:54:08.875 --> 00:54:11.736]  Going green doesn't fit with the rest of the show.
[00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:13.177]  It worked in magic.
[00:54:13.197 --> 00:54:13.678]  Make a test.
[00:54:13.918 --> 00:54:14.479]  Hey, Brian!
[00:54:14.759 --> 00:54:16.441]  I'm not gonna recycle this aluminum can.
[00:54:16.461 --> 00:54:17.743]  I'm just gonna throw it in the trash.
[00:54:21.611 --> 00:54:43.171]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production, as well as work in a message about global warming, about environmental changes, and about empowering people to take responsibility.
[00:54:43.451 --> 00:54:45.453]  Why are your wedding programs bumpy?
[00:54:47.429 --> 00:54:54.813]  We're having a green wedding, so after the reception, our guests can plant the programs real loud.
[00:54:55.474 --> 00:55:00.056]  I could live in the sea and make friends with a whale, and we'd live in a sunken pirate ship.
[00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:01.857]  That'd show global warming!
[00:55:02.317 --> 00:55:06.640]  We've come up with, you know, all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:11.883]  Everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles on our production.
[00:55:12.343 --> 00:55:13.444]  Look at all these Hummers.
[00:55:13.704 --> 00:55:15.345]  What kind of jerk would drive one of those?
[00:55:17.168 --> 00:55:22.791]  Dude, this car kicks ass!
[00:55:22.971 --> 00:55:27.774]  We're using biodiesel fuel in our generators instead of regular diesel.
[00:55:27.914 --> 00:55:29.615]  No car, no electricity.
[00:55:29.895 --> 00:55:31.156]  Alright, stop.
[00:55:32.236 --> 00:55:33.217]  I can't watch anymore.
[00:55:33.557 --> 00:55:33.977]  Stop it.
[00:55:34.037 --> 00:55:34.858]  She goes on and on.
[00:55:35.658 --> 00:55:37.220]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.462]  And there's another level of lies.
[00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:43.846]  They show reasonable things like recycling, but then tie it to the Green Agenda.
[00:55:44.247 --> 00:55:49.331]  The Green Agenda is global taxes to the private banks, now openly announced.
[00:55:50.129 --> 00:55:51.972]  It's having home inspections.
[00:55:52.052 --> 00:55:53.474]  It's not having state control.
[00:55:53.734 --> 00:55:54.896]  It's not having local control.
[00:55:55.236 --> 00:55:56.578]  So here's my issue.
[00:55:56.979 --> 00:56:05.852]  There's Fox TV making fun of George Bush with their executives so they own both sides of the market, the liberal and the conservative.
[00:56:06.872 --> 00:56:13.597]  But they always move the agenda of more collectivism and control and, quote, progressivism forward.
[00:56:14.017 --> 00:56:17.159]  And at key points, Glenn Beck's four VAT taxes.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:18.640]  He's four.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.401]  I've even seen him before the carbon taxes.
[00:56:20.462 --> 00:56:21.402]  Now lately he's been against it.
[00:56:21.862 --> 00:56:23.504]  Now that he knows he wasn't able to sucker people.
[00:56:23.884 --> 00:56:25.225]  Bill O'Reilly, the same thing.
[00:56:26.226 --> 00:56:28.307]  Saying Ron Paul supporters might be terrorists.
[00:56:28.327 --> 00:56:29.368]  Remember that three years ago?
[00:56:29.728 --> 00:56:30.529]  During the primaries?
[00:56:31.269 --> 00:56:34.210]  That the money bomb might mean they were going to blow something up and nothing to do with that?
[00:56:34.711 --> 00:56:36.512]  Saying we need to use the army against these people?
[00:56:36.712 --> 00:56:37.872]  There's no FEMA camps?
[00:56:40.233 --> 00:56:41.494]  The banker bailout's good?
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.601]  All of this is being done.
[00:56:45.182 --> 00:56:49.064]  Oh yeah, he'll expose ACORN and other little slimy groups and that's good.
[00:56:49.645 --> 00:56:51.486]  But at the end of the day, here's another one.
[00:56:51.506 --> 00:56:54.489]  He had a documentary last week about Mao being the greatest mass murderer in history.
[00:56:54.869 --> 00:56:55.790]  I've made a film about that.
[00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:58.231]  But he didn't tell you it's declassified.
[00:56:58.251 --> 00:57:01.234]  The CIA in 49 admits they put Mao in.
[00:57:01.834 --> 00:57:08.019]  Our government sent the Bolsheviks over in 1917 to overthrow the Russian government.
[00:57:09.195 --> 00:57:20.386]  The banks that run America run the communism, because big mega-corporations use communism as a way to destroy the middle class, steal their wealth, and give it to them.
[00:57:20.887 --> 00:57:24.390]  As the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said, competition is a sin.
[00:57:25.111 --> 00:57:27.252]  They founded the Modern Environmental Movement.
[00:57:27.772 --> 00:57:29.493]  They're funding Mecha and La Raza.
[00:57:29.993 --> 00:57:36.235]  The state of Texas is funding Machete, the race war anti-Anglo movie.
[00:57:37.015 --> 00:57:38.016]  Do you understand?
[00:57:38.116 --> 00:57:43.058]  They are running both sides of it to divide and conquer and bring down this republic.
[00:57:43.458 --> 00:57:46.719]  Obama works for the same people as Beck.
[00:57:50.421 --> 00:58:04.910]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:09.593]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:22.592]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:58:23.352 --> 00:58:30.619]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:40.913]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:58:41.694 --> 00:58:44.958]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:58:45.619 --> 00:58:48.723]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:58:49.304 --> 00:58:53.525]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:58:53.845 --> 00:58:54.466]  Number one.
[00:58:54.766 --> 00:58:57.907]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.187 --> 00:58:58.747]  Number two.
[00:58:59.047 --> 00:59:03.589]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:03.929 --> 00:59:04.369]  It's true.
[00:59:04.669 --> 00:59:09.230]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:10.091]  Number three.
[00:59:10.371 --> 00:59:13.652]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:13.952 --> 00:59:17.653]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:17.853 --> 00:59:18.414]  Number 4.
[00:59:18.654 --> 00:59:21.017]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:21.417 --> 00:59:24.802]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.102 --> 00:59:25.322]  Number 5.
[00:59:25.903 --> 00:59:29.828]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.048 --> 00:59:34.814]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.094 --> 00:59:39.117]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:39.257 --> 00:59:40.838]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.038 --> 00:59:43.140]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.881]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:45.901 --> 00:59:51.705]  Coast to coast.
[00:59:52.066 --> 00:59:53.467]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:54.107 --> 00:59:57.329]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:02.324]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:02.884 --> 01:00:05.725]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.065 --> 01:00:10.186]  All right, we're going to open the phones up for the next segment.
[01:00:10.246 --> 01:00:12.307]  In fact, the phone lines are open right now.
[01:00:12.327 --> 01:00:13.888]  We tried to call, but you had them closed.
[01:00:13.968 --> 01:00:14.648]  It's open now.
[01:00:14.668 --> 01:00:14.708]  888-201-2244.
[01:00:14.728 --> 01:00:14.928]  888-201-2244.
[01:00:14.988 --> 01:00:16.788]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[01:00:25.572 --> 01:00:28.374]  888-201-2244 is the number to join us.
[01:00:28.794 --> 01:00:33.498]  In this short segment, I'm going to finish up the points I was making, then come back, hit some news, and take your calls.
[01:00:33.798 --> 01:00:37.641]  But I want to hear from you specifically on, is my message getting out?
[01:00:37.681 --> 01:00:38.462]  I mean, is it clear?
[01:00:38.762 --> 01:00:39.622]  Does it make sense?
[01:00:39.642 --> 01:00:43.686]  Do you understand, basically, what I'm trying to get across?
[01:00:44.166 --> 01:00:45.827]  What I'm trying to say here?
[01:00:46.548 --> 01:00:49.130]  You've got Fox News Corp.
[01:00:50.322 --> 01:00:55.423]  Promoting the global carbon tax, while Glenn Beck exposes that commies are behind it and trying to get us.
[01:00:56.023 --> 01:00:59.384]  While his other little co-host buddy, Bill O'Reilly, is saying how good it is.
[01:01:00.604 --> 01:01:06.045]  You understand he's for all the banker bailouts, and the police state, and the MIAC report that's aimed and designed at you.
[01:01:06.365 --> 01:01:07.786]  Do you see where this is going?
[01:01:08.386 --> 01:01:15.207]  He laughs at you publicly, putting quotes in there, written for the CIA, about how they control both parties in the 60s.
[01:01:15.247 --> 01:01:17.848]  Do you understand that?
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.540]  I'd like to get your take on it.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.141]  And what about Robert Rodriguez lying?
[01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:28.382]  His ex-wife, the producer, in the news saying Alex doesn't have the script.
[01:01:28.662 --> 01:01:29.482]  They say they have it.
[01:01:29.522 --> 01:01:30.142]  They don't have it.
[01:01:30.382 --> 01:01:31.382]  None of this is in the movie.
[01:01:31.602 --> 01:01:33.522]  None of what's in the Arizona trailer's in the movie.
[01:01:33.762 --> 01:01:38.763]  It's all in the movie.
[01:01:38.783 --> 01:01:39.083]  888-201-2244.
[01:01:39.103 --> 01:01:40.844]  888-201-2244.
[01:01:41.184 --> 01:01:43.984]  And we will get you up and on the air with us.
[01:01:44.384 --> 01:01:48.105]  And you can call today if you want, but call tomorrow while they're there.
[01:01:50.027 --> 01:01:55.357]  I have said that I'm all for tax incentives, but this is even more where they're even giving money to make these films.
[01:01:58.001 --> 01:02:02.383]  They are discriminating against other films for almost no reason and not letting them have tax incentives.
[01:02:02.623 --> 01:02:10.106]  So we need to call and say you give everybody tax incentives and you never be involved in the content of a film or you get rid of these tax incentives.
[01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:11.627]  You do not discriminate.
[01:02:12.067 --> 01:02:13.248]  Here's the governor's office.
[01:02:13.308 --> 01:02:16.009]  He runs the Texas Film Commission with taxpayer money.
[01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.429]  512-463-9200.
[01:02:16.449 --> 01:02:16.549]  512-463-9200.
[01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:17.249]  Or fax them 512-463-9200.
[01:02:31.803 --> 01:02:38.429]  Call the governor and say, look, you can never bar any other film again if you give this movie funding.
[01:02:38.869 --> 01:02:41.592]  Because it's a race war movie all the way.
[01:02:42.432 --> 01:02:43.273]  And it's outrageous.
[01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:43.453]  512-463-9200.
[01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:49.418]  Governor Rick Perry, no matter where you live in the world, give him a call.
[01:02:49.659 --> 01:02:50.820]  But especially in Texas.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:55.163]  Let's play a short clip going out to break of Rick Perry saying that
[01:02:56.124 --> 01:02:59.485]  Robert Rodriguez and his films are the model of this program.
[01:03:00.145 --> 01:03:04.826]  And then later he tried to deny that they were even involved with Rodriguez and now they admit they are.
[01:03:04.886 --> 01:03:05.266]  Here it is.
[01:03:06.066 --> 01:03:07.687]  Actors love shooting in Texas.
[01:03:07.707 --> 01:03:12.428]  So do the filmmakers and other... Thank you for having faith.
[01:03:13.428 --> 01:03:17.869]  Thank you for having faith in this state and staying here knowing that we were going to get this done.
[01:03:25.643 --> 01:03:33.166]  Bobby Jindal was in town yesterday doing a little run-through, and I told him, I said, Bobby, guess what?
[01:03:34.507 --> 01:03:40.189]  All those movies you've been having over there in Louisiana, they're gonna be coming to Texas.
[01:03:42.205 --> 01:03:49.814]  And folks, just, the clip's a lot longer, it's up on Infowars.com and the articles that Aaron Dykes and Kurt Nemmo have written if you want to see the whole thing.
[01:03:50.275 --> 01:03:56.483]  But the quote in the Statesman out of that video is, you know, that Rodriguez is the model of this entire program.
[01:03:57.864 --> 01:04:00.247]  And this is like...
[01:04:01.124 --> 01:04:12.434]  The movie, The Lives of Others, a true story about the Stasi spying on people, spying on artists and writers and actors in East Germany, and how the government controlled what could and couldn't be made.
[01:04:13.355 --> 01:04:17.478]  The Pentagon is already in control of many Hollywood films, so there's nothing to do with the military in it.
[01:04:17.878 --> 01:04:19.360]  There's already this product placement.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.422]  There's already this brainwashing, this agenda.
[01:04:21.442 --> 01:04:28.408]  You just saw Fox admitting they put messages in every TV show pushing carbon taxes and global government, basically.
[01:04:29.096 --> 01:04:29.276]  What?
[01:04:29.316 --> 01:04:30.817]  Glenn Beck's over here exposing.
[01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:35.359]  Glenn Beck, key Obama ally, works with socialists for global carbon taxes.
[01:04:35.479 --> 01:04:36.099]  No, really.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.581]  Alright, your calls are coming up after this break.
[01:04:39.621 --> 01:04:41.621]  I want to get your take on this and a lot more.
[01:04:41.641 --> 01:04:45.603]  We'll also get into the economy and a lot of other news.
[01:04:45.643 --> 01:04:50.045]  But first, your phone call straight ahead on the other side of this quick break.
[01:04:50.125 --> 01:04:50.945]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:52.786]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:54.267]  The website is GCNLive.com.
[01:04:58.632 --> 01:05:01.395]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:05:01.775 --> 01:05:05.298]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:05:05.579 --> 01:05:08.221]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:05:08.461 --> 01:05:13.386]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:19.448]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:05:19.768 --> 01:05:25.109]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:05:25.429 --> 01:05:29.711]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:05:29.971 --> 01:05:38.073]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:05:38.453 --> 01:05:40.295]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:05:40.655 --> 01:05:42.697]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:43.038 --> 01:05:50.505]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:55.930]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[01:06:00.822 --> 01:06:06.847]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:07.447 --> 01:06:10.430]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:14.793]  Okay, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:06:14.913 --> 01:06:16.955]  I want to get your view on the last hour.
[01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:32.689]  The statements I made about the Republican political talk show host always being partisan, now saying they're not partisan, but claiming they want to fight the world government when the Republican leadership is bought and paid for by the very same people.
[01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:37.734]  And what do you think about Robert Rodriguez with Taxpayer Money, 18% of his film, he's set to get?
[01:06:38.851 --> 01:06:41.133]  They decide the next month, but he's been set and cued.
[01:06:41.153 --> 01:06:43.275]  When we first called him months ago, they said, yes, he's getting the money.
[01:06:45.536 --> 01:06:55.284]  When he's made a film that is about a race war and shows anybody who's against illegal immigration, murdering Catholic Hispanic priests, crucifying them, murdering pregnant Hispanic women.
[01:06:55.885 --> 01:06:56.685]  Total theater.
[01:06:57.006 --> 01:07:05.753]  Minuteman's never killed or hurt anybody, but you do have the Mexican coyotes on that side, killing the Central and South American immigrants that come in and robbing them.
[01:07:05.773 --> 01:07:07.194]  You hear about the massacres every week.
[01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:09.779]  I mean, it is hellish.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.062]  So what is your view on all this?
[01:07:12.442 --> 01:07:15.085]  Then I'm going to get into a bunch of other economic and world news.
[01:07:15.546 --> 01:07:22.634]  News on Google getting in more and more trouble for spying on private individuals are now being investigated by the Texas Attorney General.
[01:07:23.515 --> 01:07:25.097]  European governments are going after him.
[01:07:25.678 --> 01:07:28.100]  That is all coming up today.
[01:07:28.621 --> 01:07:32.403]  But I do want to throw a search term out to make it the number one Google search term, my wonderful audience.
[01:07:32.723 --> 01:07:34.584]  You did this Friday very successfully.
[01:07:34.964 --> 01:07:39.046]  We made Alex Jones demonized the number one search term in the world Friday.
[01:07:39.066 --> 01:07:51.052]  And that linked to an article by Paul Watson and another one by Kurt Nemo, the same headline, similar headline, so it would pick up in the search engine, pointing out how ABC News Nightline
[01:07:51.832 --> 01:07:52.232]  Hey Alex.
[01:07:52.252 --> 01:07:52.532]  Hey Mark.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:21.720]  Go ahead.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:27.363]  Alex, so much of what you do every day is pointing out the fruits of their labors.
[01:08:28.284 --> 01:08:29.884]  The fruits of the opposition's labors.
[01:08:30.185 --> 01:08:33.066]  They are countless.
[01:08:33.086 --> 01:08:35.107]  They're in your stacks every day.
[01:08:36.428 --> 01:08:41.530]  And what I'm looking for is a way to get to an if-then.
[01:08:43.151 --> 01:08:49.855]  If the most significant events in the last 60 years, JFK and 9-11,
[01:08:51.576 --> 01:08:57.602]  If something can be proven a lie, then look at the whole picture.
[01:08:57.982 --> 01:08:59.664]  They can take your president from you.
[01:09:01.446 --> 01:09:02.627]  They can pull down the buildings.
[01:09:03.001 --> 01:09:03.802]  No, I agree with you.
[01:09:03.822 --> 01:09:05.623]  In fact, that's what Glenn Beck's book is.
[01:09:06.884 --> 01:09:08.866]  It's a multi-faceted thing.
[01:09:08.926 --> 01:09:10.667]  For people in the know, it's a threat.
[01:09:10.947 --> 01:09:13.449]  My father read it, and I wanted to get his views.
[01:09:13.489 --> 01:09:16.632]  We had a meeting this morning, and I said, Dad, what's your view on this book?
[01:09:16.672 --> 01:09:17.692]  Before I tell people my view.
[01:09:18.013 --> 01:09:18.853]  He said, exactly.
[01:09:18.873 --> 01:09:19.834]  He said, this is a threat.
[01:09:20.374 --> 01:09:22.896]  This is Glenn Beck saying, I'm the bad guy in this book.
[01:09:23.297 --> 01:09:24.858]  I'm the guy posing as a patriot.
[01:09:25.298 --> 01:09:26.319]  You can't beat us.
[01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:27.800]  We're going to take over.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.642]  We can do anything we want to you.
[01:09:31.183 --> 01:09:34.905]  But for his brain-dead fans, it's like, that's a great fiction book!
[01:09:35.185 --> 01:09:37.607]  When he's telling you, this isn't fiction.
[01:09:37.647 --> 01:09:39.588]  He tells you in the book, this is real.
[01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:41.470]  The names have just been changed.
[01:09:43.151 --> 01:09:43.531]  Go ahead.
[01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:48.114]  You have a strong following.
[01:09:48.134 --> 01:09:52.297]  You can move search terms, you can direct information flow, you are at the
[01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:57.596]  You know, the center of quite a bit of this with the research, and the research is the key for your listeners.
[01:09:57.696 --> 01:09:59.777]  If you want to know, you can find out.
[01:09:59.937 --> 01:10:00.537]  It's all there.
[01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:01.957]  Well, I mean, listen, listen.
[01:10:02.017 --> 01:10:18.622]  This week, we've posted in the last seven days four different Rockefeller Foundation documents from their own website admitting they developed vaccines, things mixed with vaccines to sterilize the population, but only selectively.
[01:10:18.642 --> 01:10:19.902]  I mean, it's all admitted.
[01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.903]  Mark, I appreciate your call and I hear what you're saying.
[01:10:22.543 --> 01:10:25.827]  By the way, I'd forgotten to give you the new search term if you choose to make it number one.
[01:10:26.067 --> 01:10:26.728]  We're 20 for 20.
[01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:34.756]  We've never failed, and it's having a big effect because then hundreds of newspapers and publications then link through to our articles and write about it.
[01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.379]  It's a key weapon in the info war, so I'm using it.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:54.594]  we're going to put out the term machete race war machete race war machete m-a-c-h-e-t-e machete m-a-c-h-e-t-e machete race war so that folks will go actually hear what this film is really about.
[01:10:54.654 --> 01:11:04.082]  In fact give me a document cam shot this is a world war one propaganda showing a german soldier bayoneting a baby and that's basically what
[01:11:05.134 --> 01:11:11.699]  I was looking again at that Red Beckman book that he wrote a while back ago talking about
[01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:35.292]  Will and Testament of our forefathers being the Constitution.
[01:11:35.952 --> 01:11:42.575]  And that's what I've been kind of talking about a couple times regarding the Hebrew Nine as Will and Testament of Jesus.
[01:11:43.236 --> 01:11:47.037]  And, you know, but being ignored by all these churches and everything.
[01:11:47.057 --> 01:11:51.900]  Well, if my nation will get down on its knees, repent, I will heal their land.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:52.980]  I appreciate your call, Mark.
[01:11:53.421 --> 01:11:54.121]  Absolutely.
[01:11:54.421 --> 01:11:58.863]  We've got to repent and realize the mind control we're under.
[01:11:59.164 --> 01:12:01.625]  Sean, in Utah, you're on the air.
[01:12:03.188 --> 01:12:06.433]  Hi Alex, yeah I just wanted to say your message is getting out there.
[01:12:07.194 --> 01:12:14.686]  I talked to people about Glenn Beck a year ago or more I guess when he was doing the debunking the FEMA camps.
[01:12:15.584 --> 01:12:23.569]  And they were telling me I was crazy, and now people are coming around here, and I live in a pretty strong Mormon, you know, Mormon area.
[01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:26.931]  They've got the Emergency Centers Act admitting the camps they've built.
[01:12:27.071 --> 01:12:29.772]  I sent Glenn back two months before he did his show.
[01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:30.753]  Binders.
[01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:43.420]  We had our listeners emailing the civilian inmate labor camp program, Rex 84, and he admits it's all real in his book, but won't go on the radio or TV and tell folks that he was wrong, that there are FEMA camps.
[01:12:45.265 --> 01:12:49.689]  Right, and people I talk to, they say, I see a lot of flip-flopping from this guy, they tell me.
[01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:59.157]  And also, Joel Skousen, that was an amazing interview you had with him, and I use him to get into the Mormon population because he's a member as well.
[01:12:59.778 --> 01:13:02.860]  So I just want to thank you for that, and can I throw out a t-shirt idea?
[01:13:03.741 --> 01:13:03.961]  Sure.
[01:13:05.863 --> 01:13:10.207]  Watch out for stage terror, like the street sign, watch out for falling rocks.
[01:13:14.369 --> 01:13:15.070]  Sean, awesome.
[01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:15.810]  Good to hear from you.
[01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:16.871]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:20.514]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dina in Arizona.
[01:13:20.554 --> 01:13:21.395]  Dina, you're on the air.
[01:13:21.415 --> 01:13:23.297]  Hi, Alex.
[01:13:24.078 --> 01:13:28.862]  I appreciate you, and I have a bit of information I found was interesting that I wanted to bring up to you.
[01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:34.707]  I had met a gentleman a few years ago who said he was doing construction work in the Pentagon while the attacks happened.
[01:13:35.054 --> 01:13:39.495]  And he said the section that got hit with the plane, or whatever hit it, was completely empty.
[01:13:39.736 --> 01:13:45.938]  There were no documents, no people, and coincidentally... No, no, no, I interviewed a woman who was admittedly one of the victims in it.
[01:13:46.798 --> 01:13:53.100]  And, uh, again... It's just, it's all a complete lie, but go ahead, ma'am.
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:59.702]  Oh, but he was just saying that they had sprayed some type of microfiber on that part of the Pentagon.
[01:14:00.082 --> 01:14:02.883]  And also, when I was traveling through Mexico, I noticed that
[01:14:03.248 --> 01:14:13.883]  All of the pyramids that I visited, there was a strange, like, Masonic or, you know, that eye symbol at every pyramid, and they were doing excavations, so I know that they're looking for something.
[01:14:13.903 --> 01:14:15.986]  I'm just trying to take in all this information.
[01:14:16.006 --> 01:14:17.368]  It seems like it all goes together.
[01:14:18.561 --> 01:14:21.223]  Well, it certainly does, Dina, and I appreciate your call.
[01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:28.608]  I mean, there's no doubt that the Aztecs were into hardcore occult, what we'd call Satanism, chopping children's hearts out.
[01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:31.650]  But we're told, be politically correct, don't criticize a culture.
[01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:38.595]  Well, I'm against the Nazi culture, I'm against the Communist culture, and I'm against the Mesoamerican blood-drinking culture.
[01:14:38.616 --> 01:14:41.097]  You know, I'm allowed to choose what I think's good.
[01:14:41.618 --> 01:14:42.698]  You know, Coke or Pepsi.
[01:14:42.738 --> 01:14:44.019]  Well, it goes a lot deeper than that.
[01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.362]  Shawna in Mississippi, you're on the air.
[01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:51.366]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:51.946]  Yes.
[01:14:53.367 --> 01:14:54.367]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:14:54.427 --> 01:15:10.752]  I just want to talk about Glenn Beck's book, and I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but I wanted to get on the point about PNAC, Project for a New American Century, and for Obama to have a disaster to make him look good so the Republicans and Democrats can fight some more.
[01:15:12.389 --> 01:15:12.889]  No, that's it.
[01:15:12.929 --> 01:15:21.133]  They want to keep you within the left-right paradigm while claiming now... I mean, notice, five years ago, you never heard the term left-right paradigm that I coined 14 years ago.
[01:15:21.593 --> 01:15:22.794]  Now, they use it.
[01:15:22.814 --> 01:15:24.455]  They go, this isn't right-wing or left-wing.
[01:15:24.475 --> 01:15:26.275]  You know, it's not just communist governments.
[01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:28.056]  It's any big, bad government that's bad.
[01:15:28.336 --> 01:15:29.297]  And I want to be clear.
[01:15:30.077 --> 01:15:34.219]  We have forced Beck and Limbaugh and others to admit they're corrupt elites.
[01:15:34.679 --> 01:15:37.201]  We have forced them to start telling some of the truth.
[01:15:37.921 --> 01:15:39.362]  And they're doing some good now.
[01:15:40.482 --> 01:15:41.583]  Because of it.
[01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:42.864]  So, overall, it's positive.
[01:15:42.884 --> 01:15:44.165]  And I'm sorry I called you Shauna.
[01:15:44.185 --> 01:15:46.206]  I need to move my screen over here closer.
[01:15:46.487 --> 01:15:47.047]  It's Shannon.
[01:15:47.287 --> 01:15:48.068]  Anything else, Shannon?
[01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:50.149]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:51.110]  Well, stay there.
[01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:52.051]  I'm gonna come back to you.
[01:15:52.071 --> 01:15:53.512]  I'm gonna come back to you after the break.
[01:15:53.772 --> 01:15:54.412]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:15:54.432 --> 01:15:55.133]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:16:00.103 --> 01:16:06.307]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:16:06.767 --> 01:16:11.511]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:16:11.911 --> 01:16:18.695]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:16:20.637 --> 01:16:22.918]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:16:24.699 --> 01:16:27.021]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:16:29.131 --> 01:16:32.993]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:36.836]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:16:37.536 --> 01:16:38.377]  Others don't.
[01:16:38.777 --> 01:16:40.658]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:16:40.918 --> 01:16:42.419]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:45.261]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:51.845]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:18:52.493 --> 01:18:52.934]  Thank you!
[01:18:58.697 --> 01:19:02.920]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:19:03.241 --> 01:19:03.841]  Number 1.
[01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:07.304]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:19:07.584 --> 01:19:08.144]  Number 2.
[01:19:08.445 --> 01:19:12.988]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:19:13.328 --> 01:19:13.789]  It's true.
[01:19:14.069 --> 01:19:18.632]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:19:18.953 --> 01:19:19.493]  Number 3.
[01:19:19.773 --> 01:19:23.056]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:19:23.356 --> 01:19:27.059]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:19:27.259 --> 01:19:27.820]  Number 4.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:30.422]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:19:30.822 --> 01:19:34.205]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:19:34.505 --> 01:19:34.706]  Number 5.
[01:19:35.286 --> 01:19:39.209]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:44.194]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:19:44.474 --> 01:19:48.496]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:19:48.656 --> 01:19:50.237]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:19:50.437 --> 01:19:52.538]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:19:52.698 --> 01:19:55.280]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:01.643]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:02.024 --> 01:20:03.424]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:07.286]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:13.573 --> 01:20:19.900]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.704 --> 01:20:31.513]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have decided to basically make the Glenn Beck Deception, but I'm not going to probably call it the Glenn Beck Deception.
[01:20:31.533 --> 01:20:32.394]  I'm not sure yet.
[01:20:34.113 --> 01:20:42.677]  Just like I made the Obama deception when he had an 85% approval rating and it was out a month and a half after he was in office, I knew he would go back on every promise he'd made.
[01:20:43.377 --> 01:20:46.118]  And I exposed how both parties are controlled by the very same people.
[01:20:46.699 --> 01:20:47.719]  And that's what I'm going to do here.
[01:20:47.739 --> 01:20:49.380]  But it's not just going to be about Glenn Beck.
[01:20:50.191 --> 01:20:53.154]  The entire Republican establishment.
[01:20:53.714 --> 01:21:00.280]  So that you can say I'm wrong when it comes out, and then later, once they're in office, you'll say, man, he's right again.
[01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:07.247]  And that's why our stock goes up and up and up, and fewer and fewer people doubt us, because they understand we know what we're talking about.
[01:21:07.547 --> 01:21:09.369]  But I'm not even saying Glenn Beck's a bad guy.
[01:21:09.889 --> 01:21:12.351]  I've talked to two people, high-level, at Fox News.
[01:21:13.132 --> 01:21:20.337]  One of them's a household name who say Glenn Beck is scared to death and knows this is all real now and has bodyguards and didn't know what he got into.
[01:21:21.538 --> 01:21:24.360]  And that he is actually a good guy and has woken up.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:34.247]  But that he doesn't like Alex Jones and did wake up from listening to this show and has five people that listen every day and he rips off everything we do.
[01:21:35.512 --> 01:21:42.997]  And in his book, he's got this Patriot character who gets leaked the MIAC and Homeland Security reports demonizing conservatives, but doesn't say it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:43.697 --> 01:21:49.421]  So, I mean, every time I tune in, it's like he calls public schools re-education camps.
[01:21:50.041 --> 01:21:50.722]  That my term.
[01:21:51.582 --> 01:21:56.105]  It just feels weird because I love Ron Paul and his success.
[01:21:56.205 --> 01:21:58.506]  I love Judge Andrew Napolitano on Fox.
[01:21:58.887 --> 01:22:01.228]  Number one show on Fox Business only a few months in.
[01:22:01.768 --> 01:22:03.289]  Guaranteed to get higher ratings than Beck.
[01:22:03.549 --> 01:22:11.614]  He's never been a double talker, never flip-flopped, was against the banker bailout, is a real constitutionalist, was against the Patriot Act under Bush.
[01:22:12.755 --> 01:22:13.616]  Beck was for it.
[01:22:15.037 --> 01:22:18.319]  It's just that Beck is being set up as a major icon
[01:22:19.451 --> 01:22:24.675]  to be the symbol of the patriot movement and so he can stab us in the back.
[01:22:24.735 --> 01:22:31.260]  I mean, I just showed you last hour News Corp that owns Fox promoting global warming with messages in TV.
[01:22:32.728 --> 01:22:35.910]  And they've got most their News Corp people on Fox News pushing it.
[01:22:36.371 --> 01:22:44.477]  So, my point is, Rupert Murdoch is a globalist pushing world government and world taxes, and we need to hold Beck and others' feet to the fire.
[01:22:44.797 --> 01:22:50.001]  They know America's waking up, they know the world's waking up, so they're creating counterfeits to take control of it.
[01:22:50.321 --> 01:22:54.064]  But the fact that they're having to do this shows you how far we've come.
[01:22:54.484 --> 01:22:55.685]  So pray for Glenn Beck.
[01:22:56.005 --> 01:22:57.126]  Pray for Barack Obama.
[01:22:58.174 --> 01:23:07.479]  It's just watching his show, it's getting so slick, and his whole new book is about mind control, and semantical manipulation, and how to control people, and how the left and right's controlled.
[01:23:07.979 --> 01:23:09.300]  I mean, he knows what he's doing.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.601]  And of course, he didn't really write this book, it's ghost-written.
[01:23:11.901 --> 01:23:14.782]  This is high-tech information.
[01:23:15.963 --> 01:23:21.006]  And the system is trying to take over our movement, the Tea Party, and everything else.
[01:23:21.046 --> 01:23:23.407]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up now, I wanna get to your calls and then some news.
[01:23:23.907 --> 01:23:25.488]  Shannon in Mississippi, finish your point.
[01:23:27.546 --> 01:23:34.711]  Well anyway, talking about Glenn Beck, how he's got the mind control and he manipulates everybody and he's slick on TV, which he is.
[01:23:34.731 --> 01:23:37.673]  This is something I try to do and try to wake people up.
[01:23:38.133 --> 01:23:41.716]  And if these American people don't wake up, we're gonna be done.
[01:23:41.836 --> 01:23:42.676]  We're gonna be through.
[01:23:43.036 --> 01:23:44.497]  But I try to tell people about 9-11.
[01:23:46.323 --> 01:23:49.184]  And these cell phone calls that they made from those airplanes.
[01:23:49.264 --> 01:23:50.864]  Now, everybody think about it.
[01:23:50.944 --> 01:23:52.765]  This was the year 2001 now.
[01:23:53.505 --> 01:23:54.125]  Now it's the year 2000.
[01:23:54.165 --> 01:23:55.926]  These were non-air phones.
[01:23:56.386 --> 01:23:59.187]  Dozens of phone calls made from 30,000 feet or above.
[01:23:59.267 --> 01:23:59.807]  Impossible.
[01:24:00.067 --> 01:24:05.728]  And now the FBI, with the Solicitor General's wife two years ago, admitted those phone calls were never made.
[01:24:06.249 --> 01:24:07.249]  That wasn't true!
[01:24:07.889 --> 01:24:09.189]  There was no let's roll.
[01:24:09.529 --> 01:24:09.990]  None of it.
[01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:11.050]  It was all lies!
[01:24:12.452 --> 01:24:13.552]  It was all a lie.
[01:24:13.792 --> 01:24:30.358]  In fact, Alex, in the year 2006 now, I called Boeing Airlines, and I talked to some individuals there, some personnel there, and they stated that they had put new cell phone antennas or new cell phone towers in the tail sections of every cargo Airbus in the year 2006.
[01:24:31.479 --> 01:24:32.319]  Now, what did I do?
[01:24:32.679 --> 01:24:37.161]  I asked them, if they weren't so good in the year 2001, why are you doing it now in the year 2006?
[01:24:37.621 --> 01:24:39.442]  And they all stuttered.
[01:24:39.502 --> 01:24:39.962]  They couldn't
[01:24:42.895 --> 01:24:44.476]  Well, I mean, it's not your opinion.
[01:24:44.576 --> 01:24:48.638]  The FBI admits that those phone calls were not made.
[01:24:49.158 --> 01:24:50.038]  It's not true!
[01:24:51.359 --> 01:24:51.939]  It's admitted!
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.761]  And they just hide it in the Washington Post.
[01:24:57.282 --> 01:24:58.622]  But not just in the Washington Post.
[01:24:58.682 --> 01:25:02.384]  On that issue, remember two months ago, the Washington Post spy talk, the weekly column?
[01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:07.807]  They had the CIA officers bragging how they created fake bin Laden videos for U.S.
[01:25:07.827 --> 01:25:08.307]  television.
[01:25:09.707 --> 01:25:18.531]  I mean, they think we're so dumb, they go on Fox and CNN, I've played the clips here, and say, yes, our troops grow the opium and help ship it out.
[01:25:19.691 --> 01:25:20.272]  But it's good.
[01:25:21.112 --> 01:25:22.673]  And then we arrest you if you're caught with it.
[01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:26.875]  Or Limbaugh gets in trouble if he's got the hillbilly pills.
[01:25:27.415 --> 01:25:29.035]  The Oxycontin, the hillbilly heroin.
[01:25:30.236 --> 01:25:33.297]  They think you're so dumb, they just come around and go, yeah, we're growing the opium.
[01:25:33.597 --> 01:25:35.959]  Yeah, we make fake Bin Laden videos.
[01:25:36.259 --> 01:25:37.139]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:37.239 --> 01:25:39.060]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:42.672]  AK-47 in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:25:42.692 --> 01:25:45.093]  Yeah, how you doing, Jones?
[01:25:45.393 --> 01:25:47.054]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:25:47.615 --> 01:25:50.237]  I have a comment and a question.
[01:25:50.837 --> 01:25:58.622]  First, my comment is, just to get the infowar out there and wake people up, I'm a private business owner, small business owner, and at the end of every job I clean carpets.
[01:25:58.682 --> 01:26:03.485]  At the end of every job, I hand them out one of your DVDs, and I can call them back months down the road.
[01:26:03.866 --> 01:26:06.407]  And it's like killing two birds with one stone.
[01:26:06.788 --> 01:26:08.329]  I ask them, hey, how's your carpets doing?
[01:26:08.369 --> 01:26:09.910]  And by the way, what'd you think of that DVD?
[01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:14.573]  And I, ten times out of ten, go, wow, you know, it really woke me up to things I didn't know.
[01:26:14.913 --> 01:26:22.278]  So for anybody who's got a business, if you're a waiter, if you're a plumber, if you're an electrician, you know, you build up that customer relationship with that client.
[01:26:22.578 --> 01:26:25.820]  At the end of your job, you do good work, you hand it, like you said, it's free knowledge.
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:34.606]  You know, give it to them, say, watch it, and then you can call back and talk about your work, and also the DVD, it's a good way to get your foot in the door to generate more business.
[01:26:35.186 --> 01:26:36.467]  Second, my question is for you.
[01:26:36.627 --> 01:26:44.870]  Me and a couple of my friends were having a few drinks last night, and we got to thinking, you have a lot of listeners, and what about a citizen's arrest?
[01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:57.334]  I mean, if everybody got together and signed a citizen's arrest for these jokers that are in the White House and running our federal government, couldn't we find an attorney to prosecute all our millions of signatures for a citizen's arrest?
[01:26:57.799 --> 01:26:59.040]  Well, that could be done.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.642]  The problem is the courts are so corrupt they would throw it out.
[01:27:01.723 --> 01:27:03.504]  But there is the court of public opinion.
[01:27:03.924 --> 01:27:09.930]  And if the people wake up and can't be led along with this corruption, the globalists will fail.
[01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:16.516]  That's why the system has to lead false opposition or controlled opposition to control people.
[01:27:17.714 --> 01:27:22.698]  And that's why the system's panicking and having to more and more go, OK, there is a world government.
[01:27:23.198 --> 01:27:24.599]  There is a eugenics plan.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:31.425]  But in this new Glenn Beck book, he shows both sides and kind of says, maybe it's a good idea.
[01:27:31.485 --> 01:27:34.387]  Later in the week, I'm going to actually go through and read passage after passage.
[01:27:34.808 --> 01:27:41.373]  But it's actually like a sick sales job where he admits the government sponsoring terror, but maybe they're doing it for order.
[01:27:41.873 --> 01:27:46.076]  And he admits that the CIA is mind controlling, but maybe it's OK.
[01:27:47.017 --> 01:27:51.368]  And he admits that they're doing all this tyranny, but maybe they've got to do it.
[01:27:53.979 --> 01:27:55.400]  I appreciate your call, A.K.
[01:27:56.221 --> 01:28:06.610]  By the way, speaking of films, I wasn't going to plug this because they're almost all sold out and there's really no need to, but we're offering five of my documentary films, or films I produced, for $9.95.
[01:28:08.711 --> 01:28:20.401]  Full-length feature documentary, high quality, with expanded extras, Fabled Enemies, Terror Storm, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, Reflections and Warnings, How Weed Won the West, Exposing the Phony Drug War, they're almost all sold out.
[01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:21.983]  I did this just because
[01:28:23.496 --> 01:28:24.538]  I'm slashing everything.
[01:28:24.558 --> 01:28:26.461]  I mean, I'm losing money on this.
[01:28:27.242 --> 01:28:27.763]  And by the way...
[01:28:28.769 --> 01:28:30.670]  We've never had more viewers, listeners, supporters.
[01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:32.730]  I just want to get the material out.
[01:28:33.231 --> 01:28:35.311]  These specials are on InfoWars.com.

[01:29:02.574 --> 01:29:06.097]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:29:06.377 --> 01:29:09.020]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:14.185]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:30:03.613 --> 01:30:04.553]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:04.873 --> 01:30:08.374]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:08.755 --> 01:30:11.035]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:11.195 --> 01:30:16.497]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:16.897 --> 01:30:23.119]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:23.559 --> 01:30:29.123]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:29.523 --> 01:30:33.205]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:33.726 --> 01:30:37.728]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:38.008 --> 01:30:43.572]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:43.952 --> 01:30:46.914]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:47.514 --> 01:30:48.955]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:49.495 --> 01:30:49.936]  It's here.

[01:33:04.015 --> 01:33:07.238]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.604]  ABC News Nightline, Thursday night.
[01:33:22.864 --> 01:33:24.006]  Hit us and hit us hard.
[01:33:24.706 --> 01:33:26.769]  With a feature on Yours Truly.
[01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:30.573]  And they never let me talk for more than five seconds.
[01:33:30.593 --> 01:33:32.436]  They cut everything I said out of context.
[01:33:33.943 --> 01:33:34.944]  And they made jokes.
[01:33:35.104 --> 01:33:37.685]  Alex Jones says the government's putting poisons in the water.
[01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:43.648]  When they were here, I gave them government documents where they talked about putting sodium fluoride in the water to reduce fertility.
[01:33:43.908 --> 01:33:50.411]  I gave them government documents from the Rockefeller Foundation for the government and others talking about vaccines to sterilize you.
[01:33:51.271 --> 01:33:54.853]  Mainstream news promoting putting lithium in the water to make you passive.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.262]  You know, I'm forced to cover hardcore news here.
[01:33:59.602 --> 01:34:09.449]  It's kind of like in the last six, seven, eight years or even longer, I'd play clips of congressional hearings where DynCorp and Halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:34:09.969 --> 01:34:16.054]  By the way, DynCorp in the state of Texas and many other areas is the main CPS contractors taking kids.
[01:34:16.474 --> 01:34:16.994]  That's admitted.
[01:34:19.656 --> 01:34:21.397]  I mean, that's the type of issues we cover.
[01:34:21.597 --> 01:34:23.238]  Here's CNN today.
[01:34:23.639 --> 01:34:25.640]  Tens of millions of missing girls.
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:26.981]  That's the headline.
[01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:30.183]  Give me a document cam shot for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[01:34:30.563 --> 01:34:32.565]  Tens of millions of missing girls.
[01:34:33.646 --> 01:34:42.952]  And it goes on to say that in the last decade, there are 30 million missing girls.
[01:34:43.672 --> 01:34:48.496]  Now, a lot of them go to other countries to be prostitutes or to work in sweatshops, but millions
[01:34:49.597 --> 01:34:59.963]  are sex slaves and major nations are doing this on record i remember two years ago it came out in the dutch news that israel was selling
[01:35:01.257 --> 01:35:04.059]  Palestinians organs after they killed them in their presence.
[01:35:04.679 --> 01:35:10.863]  And Israel was going to go after the newspaper, and then it came out in AP a few months later.
[01:35:11.144 --> 01:35:13.105]  Israeli doctors came out and said, yeah, we're doing it.
[01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:14.486]  And China does it.
[01:35:14.526 --> 01:35:15.827]  The US has been caught doing it.
[01:35:16.207 --> 01:35:21.671]  I mean, folks, when you let corruption grow and grow and grow and deny it's there, it's going to run rampant.
[01:35:21.971 --> 01:35:26.234]  And now here's CNN, but they don't tell you who's doing it or why.
[01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:31.601]  What do you think they do in these countries they occupy in Eastern Europe, or Africa, or Asia?
[01:35:31.841 --> 01:35:33.983]  Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest countries doing it.
[01:35:34.603 --> 01:35:36.224]  Tens of millions of missing girls.
[01:35:36.904 --> 01:35:43.248]  But I thought I would then give you a few Prison Planet articles from the last six, seven years that link to mainstream news.
[01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:44.448]  These are boildowns.
[01:35:45.749 --> 01:35:48.570]  Dinecore and Halliburton sex slave scandal won't go away.
[01:35:49.071 --> 01:35:50.732]  Chicago Tribune reported on it.
[01:35:51.312 --> 01:35:53.113]  I mean, that's not Alex Jones saying that!
[01:35:54.722 --> 01:35:55.882]  I have trouble believing this.
[01:35:55.982 --> 01:35:57.563]  It's so incredible, but it's real.
[01:35:58.043 --> 01:35:59.143]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:36:01.463 --> 01:36:06.084]  And it just goes on and on and on, my friends.
[01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:09.625]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[01:36:10.565 --> 01:36:13.245]  Let's go to Francis in Germany, then Steven Pittsburgh.
[01:36:13.305 --> 01:36:14.326]  Francis, you're on the air.
[01:36:14.346 --> 01:36:15.766]  Hello, Alex.
[01:36:16.366 --> 01:36:17.226]  How are you doing?
[01:36:17.446 --> 01:36:17.826]  Welcome.
[01:36:18.986 --> 01:36:20.167]  I have some information for you.
[01:36:20.327 --> 01:36:21.487]  I'd like to read it out on to you.
[01:36:24.048 --> 01:36:24.668]  Inception.
[01:36:24.688 --> 01:36:25.789]  25-10-07.
[01:36:25.849 --> 01:36:36.954]  The same system is used in the film Star Wars, where Dartmouth is changed to Frankfurt.
[01:36:38.875 --> 01:36:39.875]  That's it.
[01:36:39.895 --> 01:36:41.916]  Alright, I don't understand you, but I appreciate your call.
[01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:43.577]  Send me an email, I'll try to explain it.
[01:36:43.917 --> 01:36:44.637]  That was interesting.
[01:36:45.497 --> 01:36:47.839]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steven in Pittsburgh.
[01:36:47.879 --> 01:36:48.619]  Steven, you're on the air.
[01:36:52.759 --> 01:36:53.961]  Yeah, he's listening to his radio.
[01:36:53.981 --> 01:36:54.803]  We're going to let him go.
[01:36:54.823 --> 01:36:56.886]  Let's go to JJ in Texas.
[01:36:56.926 --> 01:36:57.988]  JJ, you're on the air.
[01:36:58.008 --> 01:37:00.372]  Hi Alex.
[01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:07.532]  Ever since Friday when you played this hit piece from Nightline, I've been absolutely fuming.
[01:37:07.872 --> 01:37:08.672]  Foaming at the mouth.
[01:37:08.812 --> 01:37:09.173]  Fuming.
[01:37:09.753 --> 01:37:12.074]  I can't believe... I've had to write just a few points down.
[01:37:12.734 --> 01:37:17.536]  I can't believe Dan Harris has not only insulted you, but insulted everyone.
[01:37:17.596 --> 01:37:19.757]  Not only your audience, but everyone.
[01:37:19.778 --> 01:37:23.619]  They sent the host of the ABC Nightly News down here.
[01:37:23.659 --> 01:37:24.360]  That's Dan Harris.
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:24.740]  Go ahead.
[01:37:26.297 --> 01:37:34.362]  He said the language he used to you was just so unbelievable for a journalist to even just even contemplate using.
[01:37:34.643 --> 01:37:37.044]  But that's why they're hemorrhaging all their viewers.
[01:37:37.124 --> 01:37:38.525]  People don't buy their baloney.
[01:37:38.725 --> 01:37:40.226]  People say, why would you let them come here?
[01:37:40.527 --> 01:37:41.587]  They're so arrogant.
[01:37:41.868 --> 01:37:45.410]  I knew they'd make a hit piece and then it would only wake people up more.
[01:37:45.730 --> 01:37:46.631]  So bring it on!
[01:37:48.177 --> 01:37:48.437]  Right.
[01:37:48.777 --> 01:38:01.802]  Well, when he talked about you overstate your case to expose your more sinister theory, I think you should send him a copy of Machete to expose him to someone really sinister like Robert Rodriguez, who is really dangerous.
[01:38:02.672 --> 01:38:11.616]  And when you talked about your vociferous critics from the Southern Poverty Law Center, please, you're floating highly charged ideas.
[01:38:11.876 --> 01:38:18.798]  I mean, they said Alex Jones really concerns them and his millions of listeners and his growing power.
[01:38:19.199 --> 01:38:22.120]  And oh my gosh, he's exponentially growing.
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.640]  What are we going to do?
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:30.183]  But again, by letting them come here and produce that hit piece, we illustrate who they are.
[01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:36.034]  Right, the thing that got me the most was when he said, and your son knows the word propaganda?
[01:38:36.335 --> 01:38:47.405]  Well let me tell you Alex, I have listened to you since the days of public access, when I lived over by where your old offices were, and you were the only news source I let my children listen to.
[01:38:48.286 --> 01:38:52.971]  They did not watch CNN, they did not watch anything else except you, and they have grown up, they're like,
[01:38:54.151 --> 01:38:57.732]  23 and 21 now and they are wonderful like renaissance people.
[01:38:58.173 --> 01:39:03.234]  They're multi-talented, they're not cheap people because I didn't let them listen to that propaganda.
[01:39:04.214 --> 01:39:04.915]  God bless you.
[01:39:06.895 --> 01:39:07.776]  Anything else JJ?
[01:39:09.476 --> 01:39:10.676]  That's it, you go Alex.
[01:39:11.097 --> 01:39:11.537]  Thank you JJ.
[01:39:13.021 --> 01:39:20.945]  Look, they were here for a whole day and edited it down to a six and a half minute piece and he said to me, he said, do you ever overstate your case?
[01:39:20.985 --> 01:39:27.129]  Well, I'd be a liar if I said, no, I never, I never overstate my case.
[01:39:27.209 --> 01:39:32.692]  I said, no, I overstate my case sometimes, but most of the time it's worse than I even thought.
[01:39:33.988 --> 01:39:49.295]  And his issue there was, that day, I made the point that without even looking for it, it was just all over the news, four different news articles saying, we need a one-child policy in the United States, or a one-child policy would be good like Communist China has.
[01:39:49.855 --> 01:39:54.517]  And he took one of the four articles and said, well, this CNN piece is jokey.
[01:39:54.597 --> 01:39:55.438]  It wasn't jokey.
[01:39:55.938 --> 01:39:58.639]  It said, this is good green sex, only have one child.
[01:39:59.439 --> 01:40:01.240]  And then he said, well, don't you ever overstate your case.
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:02.681]  And I said, yeah, I do.
[01:40:04.124 --> 01:40:05.445]  Maybe 5% of the time out of 100.
[01:40:07.107 --> 01:40:23.122]  But, I mean, look, we were on air 10 years ago saying the end of the Glass-Steagall Act, with Top Economist on this show, was going to create tens of trillions in debt and bankrupt us by design, and that the answer would be a global bank with carbon taxes.
[01:40:23.503 --> 01:40:24.784]  Exactly that happened.
[01:40:25.244 --> 01:40:26.426]  Not because I'm smart!
[01:40:27.006 --> 01:40:31.148]  The Club of Rome, the UN, our own government said that was the plan.
[01:40:31.468 --> 01:40:38.010]  I had the articles from 1996 with Ken Lay of Enron and others with Al Gore setting it up.
[01:40:38.871 --> 01:40:44.093]  They said after we bring out the derivatives bubble, we'll have a new one with carbon taxes.
[01:40:44.133 --> 01:40:46.314]  They told us what they were going to do!
[01:40:47.970 --> 01:41:00.152]  And these neocon talk show hosts get up on the air for decades and tell you there's no world government, there's no international banks, there's no move for any of this, so you'd sit there on your butts instead of fighting it!
[01:41:02.293 --> 01:41:04.513]  We know the Democrats are out there supporting it.
[01:41:04.933 --> 01:41:09.314]  They've got a bunch of domesticated, bleeding-heart, well-meaning morons that follow them.
[01:41:10.074 --> 01:41:15.715]  But the system is worried about conservatives because they're more constitutional individually.
[01:41:17.068 --> 01:41:19.269]  And so the Republicans are going to be swept into office.
[01:41:19.289 --> 01:41:20.609]  The Democrats are in free fall.
[01:41:20.809 --> 01:41:21.830]  That wasn't hard to predict.
[01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:23.310]  Everybody's victorious.
[01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:24.491]  Oh, we're defeating Obama.
[01:41:24.731 --> 01:41:25.531]  He's a puppet!
[01:41:25.831 --> 01:41:27.592]  Now they're going to give you a right-wing puppet.
[01:41:27.972 --> 01:41:29.232]  Right-wing in name only.
[01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:31.533]  Wake up to the control system!
[01:41:31.933 --> 01:41:40.076]  What did I read from Glenn Beck's book where he quotes the CIA-financed publication, Tragedy and Hope?
[01:41:42.361 --> 01:41:49.664]  Only a thousand of these were printed, but the plates for the book got out, and that's why the public knows about this.
[01:41:49.684 --> 01:41:51.985]  This was written because it's so complex.
[01:41:52.445 --> 01:41:58.127]  Government high-level operatives, this is what Quigley wrote, needed to understand the real system.
[01:41:59.218 --> 01:42:01.119]  And he admits we're setting up a world government.
[01:42:01.139 --> 01:42:03.539]  It controls the left, the right, fascist, communist.
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.340]  They're going to have a one-child policy.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.941]  They're going to totally take over.
[01:42:07.081 --> 01:42:08.901]  I work for them, is what he said.
[01:42:09.962 --> 01:42:08.901]  1968.
[01:42:11.202 --> 01:42:13.683]  And Beck puts it in his book, laughing at you.
[01:42:14.183 --> 01:42:19.705]  The argument that the two parties should represent opposing ideals and policies is a foolish idea.
[01:42:20.265 --> 01:42:29.936]  Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts of policy.
[01:42:31.518 --> 01:42:33.320]  And then he goes on to say we control both parties.
[01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:35.891]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:42:36.491 --> 01:42:49.663]  Glenn Beck will give you all the rhetoric that's true, but then at key points, he'll support value-added taxes, banker bailouts, the Patriot Act, wars that are illegal and bankrupting us, government-sponsored terror.
[01:42:49.943 --> 01:42:53.106]  In his new book, he admits the government stages terror.
[01:42:53.386 --> 01:42:56.869]  But on his show, he says you should be arrested if you say it.
[01:42:57.089 --> 01:42:57.590]  You got it?
[01:42:59.514 --> 01:43:03.758]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:43:04.078 --> 01:43:04.678]  Number 1.
[01:43:04.999 --> 01:43:08.141]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:43:08.422 --> 01:43:08.962]  Number 2.
[01:43:09.282 --> 01:43:13.826]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:43:14.166 --> 01:43:14.607]  It's true.
[01:43:14.907 --> 01:43:19.471]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:43:19.791 --> 01:43:20.332]  Number 3.
[01:43:20.612 --> 01:43:23.895]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:43:24.195 --> 01:43:27.878]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:43:28.098 --> 01:43:28.638]  Number 4.
[01:43:28.879 --> 01:43:31.260]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:43:31.641 --> 01:43:35.043]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:43:35.323 --> 01:43:35.543]  Number 5.
[01:43:36.124 --> 01:43:40.046]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:43:40.267 --> 01:43:45.030]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:44:03.544 --> 01:44:09.588]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:44:09.969 --> 01:44:14.292]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much
[01:44:14.292 --> 01:44:14.692]  I think so.
[01:44:35.117 --> 01:44:41.300]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:45.302]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:47:00.441 --> 01:47:07.243]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:27.222]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:47:31.403 --> 01:47:34.143]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:38.344 --> 01:47:45.225]  The globalists, the social engineers have created many counterfeits of true patriots
[01:47:46.266 --> 01:47:49.469]  In the last century to try to control and manipulate populations.
[01:47:49.829 --> 01:47:52.291]  But you know that you are for real.
[01:47:52.731 --> 01:47:55.594]  You know that you have the fires of liberty burning in your heart.
[01:47:56.494 --> 01:48:03.560]  And you have had such a effect on the system that they're having to come out and admit more and more of the truth.
[01:48:04.421 --> 01:48:05.602]  To even stay relevant.
[01:48:06.926 --> 01:48:10.548]  We are funded by our sponsors and by you, the listeners.
[01:48:11.449 --> 01:48:15.271]  And I am so proud of the fact that I never sold out.
[01:48:15.592 --> 01:48:21.836]  That I said no to being given Glenn Beck's job ten years ago before he was even on the radar.
[01:48:23.305 --> 01:48:29.131]  Because my integrity is what matters at the end of the day, and I know this new world order is pure evil.
[01:48:29.852 --> 01:48:31.614]  I know they're poisoning the water supply.
[01:48:32.035 --> 01:48:37.200]  I knew those flu shots were going to kill people, and now they admit they are, and are pulling them off the shelves worldwide.
[01:48:38.482 --> 01:48:41.785]  I knew the truth, and that's what matters in history.
[01:48:42.574 --> 01:48:52.931]  And that's why your support of this broadcast and spreading the word and googling the keywords we put out so that hundreds of newspapers report on what we're putting out is so important in the search term today.
[01:48:53.945 --> 01:48:55.887]  Of course, it deals with the movie Machete.
[01:48:55.927 --> 01:48:58.109]  The search term is Machete Race War.
[01:48:58.629 --> 01:49:02.372]  Enter those three words, Machete Race War, and it will be the top search term.
[01:49:02.712 --> 01:49:08.157]  I have no doubt it will fail because of your great activism on this holiday weekend, and I'm in here live.
[01:49:08.497 --> 01:49:11.180]  Now, I'm going to race through as many calls as possible.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.782]  Steve, Cody, Ben, Josh, Chuck, Roger, Swan.
[01:49:14.242 --> 01:49:14.943]  One minute apiece.
[01:49:15.323 --> 01:49:16.324]  Steve in Canada.
[01:49:16.564 --> 01:49:17.885]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:49:18.846 --> 01:49:19.687]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:49:19.847 --> 01:49:20.187]  Good, sir.
[01:49:20.808 --> 01:49:21.128]  Good.
[01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:22.189]  Big fan of yours.
[01:49:23.362 --> 01:49:26.965]  Just wanted to give you a quick update on the police state up here in Canada.
[01:49:28.166 --> 01:49:43.096]  I live in a decent neighborhood in downtown Edmonton and one of my neighbors was out back cleaning out his car and the cops rolled up and asked him for license and registration while he was cleaning out his car.
[01:49:44.297 --> 01:49:48.240]  It's the same thing in England, same thing here, but the illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:52.103]  It's about training you to line up and produce your papers.
[01:49:53.888 --> 01:49:55.269]  Yeah, I just, I couldn't believe it.
[01:49:55.289 --> 01:49:56.970]  I was sitting here and I looked over.
[01:49:57.030 --> 01:50:10.278]  Hey, there are articles every few weeks I see out of Canada where, you only hear about it when it's a TV host or a newspaper writer because they're mad and write about it, where they get police at their door over a shotgun their daddy gave them 50 years ago.
[01:50:10.678 --> 01:50:12.880]  And they say, that's not registered, turn it in.
[01:50:14.096 --> 01:50:21.978]  They're talking about scrapping the long gun registry up here, because they've already wasted a billion dollars on it, and they said it was only supposed to be a three or four million dollar thing.
[01:50:22.398 --> 01:50:32.140]  Yeah, my parents were in Canada two weeks ago, my dad brought me a newspaper back, I never brought it to the studio to cover it, and it talked about the major city, how they threw out the police chief, and the whole government.
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:36.321]  Canadians, the sleeping giant, is rising over that gun issue.
[01:50:36.982 --> 01:50:42.963]  Oh yeah, like especially out here, out west in Alberta, like I grew up in a farming community, and everybody had guns.
[01:50:43.672 --> 01:50:48.295]  You know, I mean, you go hunting, you go eat deer, you go eat moose, you know, shoot coyotes.
[01:50:48.415 --> 01:50:49.616]  Oh, hey, hey, hey!
[01:50:49.956 --> 01:50:57.761]  In 2000, the real Crocodile Dundee, the guy that Hogan made that movie about, wouldn't turn his guns in.
[01:50:57.981 --> 01:51:01.583]  They came to his house, they had a shootout, he killed and wounded a couple cops.
[01:51:01.623 --> 01:51:04.385]  They killed him to come take his hunting rifle.
[01:51:04.565 --> 01:51:07.027]  They killed the real Crocodile Dundee.
[01:51:07.348 --> 01:51:13.334]  Now the guy that made the movie about it isn't allowed to leave Australia because he quote didn't pay all of his taxes.
[01:51:13.374 --> 01:51:14.295]  I appreciate your call.
[01:51:14.715 --> 01:51:15.576]  It's just amazing.
[01:51:15.896 --> 01:51:17.678]  Cody in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:51:17.698 --> 01:51:21.702]  Hey Alex, I've got a really good fluoride story for you.
[01:51:22.303 --> 01:51:24.965]  A couple years back I'm taking a
[01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:32.002]  Environmental science class at a junior college, and the discussion came up with water quality.
[01:51:32.602 --> 01:51:35.143]  I pulled a class that they've been putting fluoride in our water.
[01:51:35.163 --> 01:51:39.405]  So the teacher, you know, turned it into a heated debate.
[01:51:39.445 --> 01:51:51.170]  The teacher storms out, grabs the water quality report from the town I live in, which I had mentioned that I had a copy, goes through it, looks in, and sure enough, she finds it.
[01:51:51.872 --> 01:52:07.105]  So fast forward two years, I'm training this new girl at work and she's talking about some teacher that is very adamant about fluoride in the water and making all of her kids do these assignments about fluoride in the water.
[01:52:07.125 --> 01:52:09.167]  So you're saying you woke that person up?
[01:52:11.511 --> 01:52:15.514]  I woke that person up and every student that she's had ever since then.
[01:52:15.574 --> 01:52:18.557]  And it shows the power... Let me stop you.
[01:52:18.877 --> 01:52:20.338]  That's why my brain is spinning.
[01:52:20.378 --> 01:52:21.679]  I finally read his new book.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.682]  He says, drink tap water, it's good for you.
[01:52:25.943 --> 01:52:29.465]  Bex tells his listeners, drink it, trust the government.
[01:52:30.927 --> 01:52:32.308]  I mean... Exactly, Alex.
[01:52:33.369 --> 01:52:38.293]  This is just amazing and it just shows that we can wake people up one by one.
[01:52:38.353 --> 01:52:39.894]  It's very hard, but we can do it.
[01:52:41.226 --> 01:52:51.894]  Cody, again, Hollywood puts this image of a hero like Schwarzenegger, the archetype of Hercules, defeating the dragon or defeating the Hydra.
[01:52:52.194 --> 01:52:54.455]  No, it's little things that will defeat them.
[01:52:54.695 --> 01:52:58.538]  It's little things that build up and are an unstoppable force.
[01:52:58.878 --> 01:52:59.779]  God bless you, Cody.
[01:53:00.079 --> 01:53:00.940]  Beautiful story.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.821]  Ben in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:53:02.841 --> 01:53:07.024]  Ben, a TV member, huge supporter of InfoWars.
[01:53:07.064 --> 01:53:09.786]  I just wanted to mention that the National Security Strategy, May 2010,
[01:53:11.539 --> 01:53:16.361]  Tons of talk of global governance and international orders.
[01:53:16.381 --> 01:53:19.642]  I just wanted to see maybe an analysis by you or one of your writers.
[01:53:19.682 --> 01:53:21.022]  Well, I haven't looked at it.
[01:53:21.202 --> 01:53:26.364]  Did you say that was the 2010 National Security Strategy by the National Security Council run by General Jones?
[01:53:27.284 --> 01:53:28.705]  Yes, well it's out, it's on the White House.
[01:53:29.286 --> 01:53:31.869]  Dog, uh, that's the one, and uh, just came out.
[01:53:45.006 --> 01:53:53.792]  Listen, the Pentagon six years ago put out a report admitting they work for world government, and they had Thomas Barnett before that.
[01:53:54.212 --> 01:53:56.754]  Naval War College professors say the same thing.
[01:53:56.994 --> 01:53:58.475]  But no, I haven't seen this new one.
[01:53:58.695 --> 01:54:00.836]  So you're saying they just come right out with global government?
[01:54:01.777 --> 01:54:03.538]  International order all over the place.
[01:54:03.578 --> 01:54:05.660]  Subsections, big sections devoted to it.
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:10.323]  They use the IMF and the United Nations as examples of the order that they're setting up.
[01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:12.084]  It's pretty clear.
[01:54:12.304 --> 01:54:13.545]  And they say global governance?
[01:54:15.086 --> 01:54:18.729]  Sure they use that in there somewhere, but international order is all over the place.
[01:54:19.650 --> 01:54:21.211]  Well, it's standard operating procedure.
[01:54:21.231 --> 01:54:28.997]  That's why they can't deny it, but they'll have their controlled operatives come out and lead the opposition to it, so at key points they can go along with it.
[01:54:29.217 --> 01:54:30.839]  Good points, we'll look into it immediately.
[01:54:31.079 --> 01:54:31.900]  Who's up next, guys?
[01:54:34.622 --> 01:54:36.603]  Josh in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:54:38.045 --> 01:54:38.525]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:39.005 --> 01:54:39.406]  How's it going?
[01:54:39.866 --> 01:54:40.427]  Welcome, sir.
[01:54:40.487 --> 01:54:40.687]  Good.
[01:54:41.730 --> 01:54:41.990]  Excellent.
[01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:43.852]  Two points I wanted to touch on.
[01:54:44.072 --> 01:54:53.502]  One, I didn't hear you talk about it yet, but tomorrow night, 9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time on National Geographic, Giuliani is going to be talking.
[01:54:53.542 --> 01:54:54.623]  Giuliani's 9-11.
[01:54:54.723 --> 01:54:59.248]  He's going to say in his own words, I guess, his recounts of
[01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:03.829]  Of the events of that day, so it'd be interesting just to watch and see.
[01:55:03.929 --> 01:55:10.233]  Really, I wonder if he'll talk about how they ran a drill to attack the World Trade Centers that morning called Tripod 2.
[01:55:10.853 --> 01:55:23.742]  He'd admitted it on 9-11, on ABC and CBS, then he denied it till the videos were produced, or the new NIST footage the feds were sued to release, where it confirms Barry Jennings and others in the building with bombs going off in Building 7.
[01:55:23.782 --> 01:55:25.163]  Hmm, wonder if he'll talk about that.
[01:55:26.807 --> 01:55:27.388]  Exactly.
[01:55:27.548 --> 01:55:30.550]  We'll see if he brings up his emergency command center that he had in Building 7.
[01:55:32.011 --> 01:55:32.872]  I wonder if he will.
[01:55:32.912 --> 01:55:33.673]  We'll look into it.
[01:55:33.713 --> 01:55:34.193]  Thank you.
[01:55:34.914 --> 01:55:37.035]  Let's talk to Sean in Arizona.
[01:55:37.436 --> 01:55:38.457]  Sean, you're on the air.
[01:55:38.517 --> 01:55:38.877]  Welcome.
[01:55:41.839 --> 01:55:48.425]  Patriot Alex, I've talked to you a couple times in the past and giving up your Labor Day weekend, you know as all of us listening that
[01:55:49.724 --> 01:55:56.107]  We may not have Labor Day weekends to be free and party and get drunk and all these crazy things that people do anymore.
[01:55:56.267 --> 01:56:02.769]  The most important thing is to talk about freedom because freedom is in its waning hours in America.
[01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:04.710]  A couple of salient points.
[01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:09.952]  I called twice before because I was there around Reagan at the convention and you started mentioning this today.
[01:56:09.992 --> 01:56:15.054]  The most important thing is we know now that Republicans really are poised to make
[01:56:16.107 --> 01:56:16.987]  A big score here.
[01:56:17.387 --> 01:56:20.068]  Maybe gain back both houses here in the fall.
[01:56:20.508 --> 01:56:22.568]  But it's not a victory for freedom.
[01:56:22.588 --> 01:56:24.229]  And I saw that when I worked for Reagan.
[01:56:24.249 --> 01:56:24.969]  I was very young.
[01:56:25.509 --> 01:56:26.229]  He was a great guy.
[01:56:26.269 --> 01:56:27.169]  I liked him personally.
[01:56:27.549 --> 01:56:36.631]  But the week of the platform hearings in Detroit, which is the week before the televised convention... They came in and said, you will put George W. Bush in.
[01:56:36.651 --> 01:56:41.012]  George Herbert Walker Bush, who Reagan had exposed as a Trilateral Commission globalist.
[01:56:41.753 --> 01:56:42.433]  ...in Rockefeller.
[01:56:42.473 --> 01:56:43.873]  I was 19 years old at the time.
[01:56:44.614 --> 01:56:45.975]  And I was picking up these people.
[01:56:46.015 --> 01:56:47.377]  They were surrounding him then.
[01:56:48.037 --> 01:56:49.759]  And, you know, they've got their Stooges.
[01:56:49.779 --> 01:56:51.060]  We know Glenn Beck is one of them.
[01:56:51.341 --> 01:56:55.985]  The big disappointment, though, is, as a Westerner, this Sarah Palin.
[01:56:57.206 --> 01:57:00.750]  You know, I guess they've thrown a lot of money at her, but what a disappointment.
[01:57:01.571 --> 01:57:04.313]  Yes, she's the reason you got open border John McCain.
[01:57:05.373 --> 01:57:14.059]  Absolutely, and you know McCain, I hate to say, McCain's wife's father was tied to some very tough things.
[01:57:14.279 --> 01:57:15.520]  McCain's completely false.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:20.463]  But the thing about Palin is, you know, her husband, as Pat Buchanan noted,
[01:57:21.239 --> 01:57:37.662]  Quickly, on that first day that she was announced to the world in August, a couple of August ago, two years ago now, you know, her husband was part of the Sagebrush Rebellion in Alaska, the separation movement, and she apparently has just completely swung over, and I thought... Brother, I'm out of time!
[01:57:37.682 --> 01:57:40.483]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:40.643 --> 01:57:43.803]  If you missed any of the first hour, I covered key intel.

[01:57:45.584 --> 01:57:46.464]  Have a great weekend.
[01:57:46.504 --> 01:57:47.004]  Be safe.

[01:58:10.582 --> 01:58:12.862]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:58:14.642 --> 01:58:16.603]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
