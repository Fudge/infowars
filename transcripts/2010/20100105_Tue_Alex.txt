[00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:08.861]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:10.342]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:12.043]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:16.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:20.908]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:37.610]  Here is the London Guardian headline story today.
[00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:43.072]  New Scanners Break Child Porn Laws.
[00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:55.058]  And we have a detailed breakdown of this and show you what the news isn't showing you when they show you blurred and derezzed images on the news of the naked body scanners.
[00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:58.939]  They always show you someone with a gun to create the image and the idea that
[00:01:02.176 --> 00:01:04.077]  Everyone going through the scanners is guilty.
[00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:05.418]  That's the subconscious image.
[00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:06.779]  And they blur it.
[00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:14.503]  But we've gone to the company websites to show what they actually show, and it is down to the pores on your skin.
[00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:25.009]  And up on screen, we will put you, post for you, some of these images throughout the next hour with Mike Rivera.
[00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.273]  We also have articles up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that I'm asking everyone
[00:01:33.618 --> 00:01:34.018]  To get.
[00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:40.500]  This is so important, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.842]  It is so absolutely vital that everyone go to PrisonPlanet.com and get these headline articles.
[00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:51.943]  Airports set to become primary peddlers of child porn.
[00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:56.064]  Alex Jones calls for mass resistance implementation of body scanners.
[00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:02.586]  Why this is being done, this act of supplication, this act of submission, if they can train you to accept this,
[00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:13.129]  If they can train you to go along with this and biometrically scan your body and have a biometric image of your body that they can then use with passive scanners on the streets to scan through and get your identity.
[00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.410]  Similar to face scanning.
[00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:16.572]  This is globally being done.
[00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:19.755]  Also, other headlines at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.398]  Military industrial complex set to make killing from body scanners.
[00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:25.940]  Chertoff, Ridge, all of them making money.
[00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:29.028]  Obama pushing it.
[00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:30.510]  All of this being introduced.
[00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.191]  They ordered the scanners a year ago.
[00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:36.335]  They're going in this year to all the major airports in the world, in the Western world.
[00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:37.336]  214 in the U.S.
[00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:39.018]  They want to make everyone go through them.
[00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.060]  They admit they're going to do it incrementally.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.902]  They say so you don't revolt.
[00:02:43.302 --> 00:02:47.286]  They even talk about how they're managing you like animals, using psychology on you.
[00:02:51.952 --> 00:02:53.673]  It is just unbelievable.
[00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:55.153]  Has nothing to do with security.
[00:02:55.173 --> 00:03:01.256]  With us for the rest of the hour, joining us from Hawaii, is the man that heads up WhatReallyHappened.com, Mike Rivero.
[00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:08.079]  And obviously, Mike, I want to talk about all the different facets of the body scanners first, then we'll get into all the news on the economy.
[00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:13.181]  As it implodes and all the numbers come out, it's just devastating, all by design by the banks.
[00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:16.097]  We're going to get into government takeover of healthcare.
[00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:19.578]  Big developments there as they plan to try to pass it in secret in conference.
[00:03:20.058 --> 00:03:20.518]  That's U.S.
[00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:21.438]  News and World Report.
[00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:31.701]  Mike Rivera, does it make your blood boil to know that your wife, your children, your family will all be put in a database just like they've now declassified everyone for 37 years?
[00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:34.461]  They said their blood taken at birth and put in a DNA database.
[00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:37.822]  I mean, this is a lawless criminal state, Mike Rivera.
[00:03:38.755 --> 00:03:43.196]  Well, more than that is an indication that this is a government that is definitely afraid of its own population.
[00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:50.358]  And you were mentioning earlier that they're trying to manage the public perception of these body scanners in order to avoid a revolt.
[00:03:50.658 --> 00:03:52.378]  And that is clearly what they're afraid of.
[00:03:52.618 --> 00:03:54.279]  They're not worried about airline bombers.
[00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.679]  They're not worried about any of this stuff.
[00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.400]  They are worried that as they push the American people
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.501]  Further and further, at some point there's going to be a revolt.
[00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:10.343]  So all of this body scanning and all of this database, it is an attempt by the government to reassure itself that it is still in control of the population of the United States of America.
[00:04:10.823 --> 00:04:13.344]  I think they may be spinning a self-destructive fantasy.
[00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:15.765]  I think there's simply too much data for them to manage.
[00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:23.287]  I mean, this whole crotch bomber with his Fruit of the Boom underwear proves they've got the data, but they can't get anything meaningful out of it.
[00:04:23.327 --> 00:04:27.888]  Everybody's saying, oh yes, we knew he was out there, there was indications this and all this, now there's a
[00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:33.271]  A fight between Great Britain and the United States over who had the information and who dropped the ball.
[00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:36.413]  And basically, they're drowning in the wealth of all of this data.
[00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:38.234]  Now, I don't like being put in databases.
[00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:39.495]  I don't like being scanned.
[00:04:39.895 --> 00:04:44.858]  But I think the bottom line is, they're collecting so much data on everybody, they can't manage it.
[00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.279]  They've got a huge data management problem.
[00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:46.719]  Mike, stay there.
[00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:56.725]  Well, clearly they staged the event to begin with, to simultaneously launch their new war against Yemen, as well as North Africa, and to sell their body scanners that they announced that day.
[00:05:00.137 --> 00:05:01.118]  What's your home worth?
[00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:03.221]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:06.165]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:13.974]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:17.619]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.342]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:06:06.483 --> 00:06:07.723]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:06:07.743 --> 00:06:08.423]  It's very real.
[00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:12.345]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:16.786]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:49.227]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:04.456]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:07:04.576 --> 00:07:06.539]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.962]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:10.965]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:07:11.405 --> 00:07:12.767]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:07:13.027 --> 00:07:14.069]  There is a solution.
[00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:22.296]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:08:01.227 --> 00:08:03.428]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:09.632]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.672 --> 00:08:16.796]  Now remember, general aviation, people that own their own Cessna, or people that charter jets, they don't have to go through the body scanners.
[00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:19.918]  They don't have to take their shoes off, pull their shirts out.
[00:08:20.498 --> 00:08:24.180]  Go through these acts of submission, and notice how it's ratcheted up incrementally.
[00:08:24.781 --> 00:08:26.882]  The government admits they're doing this to train you.
[00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:34.156]  And if they can get you to put up with this, then they believe you'll go along with literally anything.
[00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:37.817]  In the last hour today, I'm going to break down the legalese of all this.
[00:08:37.877 --> 00:08:39.358]  It is not a privilege to fly.
[00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:41.059]  It is not a privilege to drive.
[00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:42.680]  It is not a privilege to travel.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.021]  It is not a privilege to own a gun.
[00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:46.862]  It is not a privilege to own property.
[00:08:47.202 --> 00:08:51.464]  But all of these basic rights are being abridged and eroded and basically abolished.
[00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:53.085]  Okay?
[00:08:53.145 --> 00:08:54.645]  It is not a privilege.
[00:08:54.705 --> 00:08:56.006]  They tell you it's a privilege.
[00:08:56.066 --> 00:08:57.327]  It's not a privilege.
[00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:59.559]  They're doing this through color of law.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.865]  Private airports, but they're not, they use taxpayer money, could do this.
[00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:14.980]  Private aircraft companies could do this that ferry people and goods, but they're using government to order it in front of their private operation in agreements.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.560]  It's a fraud.
[00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:17.843]  And it has nothing to do with keeping you safe.
[00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:25.254]  Mike Rivero joins us with his one-month visit from Hawaii, streaming video, not just audio, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:25.534 --> 00:09:28.778]  Mike, continuing with the fact that they want to break our spirits.
[00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:29.720]  They want to break our back.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.901]  They want us to capitulate.
[00:09:31.642 --> 00:09:31.802]  I think?
[00:09:51.849 --> 00:09:52.950]  They are in the U.S.
[00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.351]  putting children through these.
[00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:55.251]  They are recording it.
[00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:56.052]  They are saving it.
[00:09:56.492 --> 00:10:00.095]  I mean, this is outrageous, and I'll talk later about what comes next.
[00:10:00.695 --> 00:10:04.057]  And I also want your ideas, Mike, on how we boycott this, how we fight it.
[00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:09.121]  Then we'll get into the latest hype to attack Yemen, happening right before the underwear bomber.
[00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:13.383]  The latest hype for scanners coming out within minutes of the underwear bomber on Christmas Day.
[00:10:13.764 --> 00:10:21.049]  Clearly, all of this is concerted for the rollout of the next level, the tightening of the control grid noose around our necks.
[00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:30.578]  You're absolutely correct and this has got nothing to do with security because as you know the Amsterdam airport already had these full-body scanners.
[00:10:30.618 --> 00:10:32.920]  Now we've gotten two stories from this crotch bomber.
[00:10:33.281 --> 00:10:38.005]  The first one they said he went through the scanner but he hid the explosive behind his testicles.
[00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:42.188]  And then everybody said, well, that proves the body scanners don't work.
[00:10:42.248 --> 00:10:47.550]  So then they changed the story and said, oh, well, he was allowed to get on board the plane without going through the scanner.
[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.711]  So they're still trying to sell you that these scanners are going to help.
[00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:57.255]  But the bottom line is that all of the security is a waste of time and money if the people running it just let anybody on the plane.
[00:10:57.275 --> 00:10:59.596]  We know this guy was allowed on the plane without a passport.
[00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:00.896]  There was an intervention.
[00:11:01.196 --> 00:11:06.079]  We know that security at the Amsterdam airport is run by the same company that ran security at all the 9-11 airports.
[00:11:07.219 --> 00:11:10.562]  We know that the shoe bomber went through Amsterdam Airport.
[00:11:10.742 --> 00:11:12.044]  He got past security.
[00:11:12.364 --> 00:11:15.567]  It's all a big joke and a big scam.
[00:11:15.707 --> 00:11:18.629]  Again, the goal is to make money selling these scanners.
[00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:24.535]  The goal is to condition the American people into thinking they have no right of privacy whatsoever.
[00:11:25.545 --> 00:11:28.466]  The government can look at your naked body whenever they feel like it.
[00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:32.848]  The next step will be making us fly naked on the airplane and saying you can't use the restroom.
[00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:34.908]  They're talking about these shock bracelets.
[00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:36.489]  It's completely out of control.
[00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:44.011]  By the way, Mike, they're already saying in the last hour, keep your hands in your lap, put nothing on your lap, no electronics, period, on any flight.
[00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:46.392]  They are literally training us to be prisoners.
[00:11:46.432 --> 00:11:50.894]  And I'm showing photos on PrisonPlanet.tv right now for TV viewers.
[00:11:51.214 --> 00:11:54.235]  Radio listeners can go read the articles at PrisonPlanet.com and see them.
[00:11:54.855 --> 00:11:59.799]  Where it shows the woman completely naked, men completely naked, their genitalia hanging.
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:11.449]  It shows it all and then we show another photo of the TSA with a woman in the scanner as the man looks at another woman's naked body on the screen with a smile on his face.
[00:12:12.745 --> 00:12:17.827]  Well, it's definitely, it's a complete, it's almost dehumanizing the American people.
[00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:19.128]  It's not almost, it is!
[00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:24.550]  We're being turned into objects, we're run through the scanners, we're sent off to war, we're sent off to the tax farms.
[00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:32.473]  You know, we're being objectified in a way that, you know, men's magazines never even dreamt of doing to people.
[00:12:32.673 --> 00:12:34.454]  Now you want to know how we're going to stop this thing?
[00:12:34.534 --> 00:12:39.656]  I think it's going to destroy itself because we're already seeing that tourism in the United States has
[00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:41.477]  Just absolutely plummeted.
[00:12:41.517 --> 00:12:42.958]  We're dying out here in Hawaii.
[00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:47.442]  California's on the verge of bankruptcy and their loss of tourism is a big part of it.
[00:12:47.742 --> 00:12:50.204]  The way that we stop this is we stop using the airlines.
[00:12:50.544 --> 00:12:51.565]  We stop traveling.
[00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:54.707]  You know, we travel only when we have to.
[00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:59.790]  But at a higher level, that's what Maurice Strong and the U.N.
[00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:00.110]  admit.
[00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.570]  They want to shut down air travel.
[00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.251]  They want an international tax on travel.
[00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:05.211]  But go back.
[00:13:05.271 --> 00:13:05.911]  I mean, you're right.
[00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:07.372]  I've seen the statistics.
[00:13:07.652 --> 00:13:16.034]  Since 9-11, and it's not happening in the rest of the world, people aren't coming to America because people that come from freer countries know this is a police state.
[00:13:16.334 --> 00:13:19.735]  I talk to Russians that come here, and they can't believe what a police state.
[00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:22.396]  They say, when I was a little kid in Russia, it was like this.
[00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:24.302]  Yeah, very much.
[00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:26.163]  We have become the evil empire here.
[00:13:26.203 --> 00:13:28.184]  We had some very good friends who lived in Great Britain.
[00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:30.206]  They would come out here to Hawaii once a year.
[00:13:30.526 --> 00:13:36.590]  They stopped years ago and they said, we can't relax in Hawaii when we're treated like POWs everywhere we go at the airport.
[00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.272]  And they're absolutely correct.
[00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:39.512]  It's completely out of control.
[00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.454]  I've offered to fly the Watsons here.
[00:13:41.894 --> 00:13:43.856]  The Watsons, I've flown to England to meet them.
[00:13:43.896 --> 00:13:45.036]  They've flown here before.
[00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.579]  I've offered, it's been four years since they were here, to fly
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.382]  Steve Watson and Paul Watson to the U.S.
[00:13:52.442 --> 00:13:53.763]  and they don't even want to come.
[00:13:54.683 --> 00:13:56.805]  But they're living in a police state there as well.
[00:13:58.186 --> 00:14:04.471]  It's just absolutely amazing and the thing is we're going to destroy our airline industry, we're going to destroy our tourism industry.
[00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:15.399]  What is this government thinking that they're so eager to just put profits in the pockets of their cronies that they're willing to completely destroy what little remains of the private economy in the United States?
[00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:17.730]  Well, it's incredible.
[00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:42.853]  Mike Rivero, as the public goes online to the security company's own sites and actually sees the 360 naked image, and as the public learns that the feds are already proposing for people that might actually hide bombs in their stomachs or drugs, they're talking about high-powered MRIs, and we just printed, in fact, bring it in to me, the CBS News stories where they admit
[00:14:43.453 --> 00:14:45.914]  That these MRIs are cancer-causing.
[00:14:45.974 --> 00:14:47.314]  These are high-powered.
[00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.614]  These fire waves into your body.
[00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:56.216]  Well, even the full-body scanners, it's now being discovered, they are able to damage DNA.
[00:14:56.516 --> 00:15:07.798]  Now, they're not powerful enough to break molecules completely apart, but that center of the DNA helix is intentionally weak because it has to unzip in order to replicate the DNA during cell division.
[00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:10.600]  And so it's a very, very delicate chemical bond.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:16.685]  And they're discovering that these terahertz waves in these full-body scanners are ripping these DNA strands apart in your body.
[00:15:16.705 --> 00:15:18.546]  So they're sort of flopping loose.
[00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:25.772]  And that means the enzymes that have to travel down the DNA to copy off protein manufacturing instructions, they're getting bad information.
[00:15:25.872 --> 00:15:29.415]  And that's mainline universities in Europe, China, the U.S.
[00:15:29.455 --> 00:15:30.136]  are finding this.
[00:15:30.436 --> 00:15:32.037]  Here's another article, CBS News.
[00:15:32.358 --> 00:15:34.499]  New focus on dangers of CT scans.
[00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:36.361]  They know it's hurting people.
[00:15:37.489 --> 00:15:41.072]  And they're going to start just zapping everybody at every airport with these things.
[00:15:41.393 --> 00:15:47.238]  We're going to wait about four or five years and there's going to be an explosive epidemic of skin cancers and all these other problems.
[00:15:47.598 --> 00:15:49.760]  And the government won't care because they've made their money.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.862]  They've sold us another pig in a poke.
[00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:54.464]  You know, they weren't able to sell us a global carbon tax.
[00:15:54.645 --> 00:15:56.046]  They weren't able to sell us vaccines.
[00:15:56.226 --> 00:15:57.667]  They're going to sell us these security machines.
[00:15:57.687 --> 00:16:00.690]  They don't care what they sell us as long as they're getting their money.
[00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.813]  And they don't care what damage it does to us as long as they get their money.
[00:16:04.153 --> 00:16:05.754]  And it sets the precedent they can get away with anything.
[00:16:05.794 --> 00:16:15.877]  Remember in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s, radiation tests on foster children and other millimeter wave tests, they've done all this already to troops and foster children.
[00:16:16.137 --> 00:16:17.157]  They know what it does.
[00:16:17.797 --> 00:16:22.779]  They absolutely do and they've shown a complete disregard for the victims of these experiments in these systems.
[00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:31.782]  The goal is to make money and to establish their agenda and the personal harm to individual citizens is just considered a cost of achieving
[00:16:32.402 --> 00:16:32.963]  Uh, the goal.
[00:16:33.043 --> 00:16:34.605]  We're, we're being, we're, we're objects.
[00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:35.686]  They don't care what happens to us.
[00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:36.727]  They don't care if we're getting sick.
[00:16:37.008 --> 00:16:38.449]  Look at all the food additives.
[00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:39.130]  They love it!
[00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.570]  They love it.
[00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.491]  In fact, stop right there.
[00:16:40.531 --> 00:16:41.412]  You bring up food additives.
[00:16:41.813 --> 00:16:44.936]  I ordered a pizza a few weeks ago for the guys up here late night working on a film.
[00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.038]  Papa John's.
[00:16:46.298 --> 00:16:46.318]  I...
[00:16:47.359 --> 00:17:09.884]  Uh, rip open the package of pepper, dump it on my pizza, and then read, crushed peppers treated with radiation, which again, 100% conclusive, at bare minimum, it kills the food value of it, and in every major study in lab animals, causes all sorts of illnesses, and now, literally, Crohn's disease didn't exist, autoimmune disease of the intestines, 50 years ago.
[00:17:09.984 --> 00:17:13.485]  Now, I've got two people in my office with Crohn's disease.
[00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:19.894]  I've got an employee who's out today because his mother is in great danger of dying from Crohn's.
[00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:22.161]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:26.162]  We know that there's a link between vaccines and autism.
[00:17:26.482 --> 00:17:29.662]  We know that there's all kinds of these problems between food additives.
[00:17:30.623 --> 00:17:33.123]  My wife went through that with joint pain and formaldehyde.
[00:17:33.583 --> 00:17:44.505]  And we're just finding out now that 20% of the 84,000 chemicals in common commercial usage in the United States are kept secret because they're treated as proprietary secrets of the company.
[00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:46.565]  Nobody knows what is in these products.
[00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:49.626]  Nobody knows if they've ever been tested for safety and toxicity.
[00:17:50.286 --> 00:17:50.546]  There's a
[00:17:50.646 --> 00:18:06.030]  That's why it says natural and unnatural flavors or artificial flavors is and that's now declassified 18,500 chemicals plus that are secret and these big companies are eugenicists.
[00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.570]  They're doing it on purpose, Mike.
[00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.371]  That's why the public's so passive.
[00:18:09.591 --> 00:18:12.852]  Can you imagine a hundred years ago they tried to put naked body scanners in?
[00:18:13.312 --> 00:18:14.312]  No one would put up with that.
[00:18:15.137 --> 00:18:16.538]  Yeah, it is a mystery to me.
[00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:33.596]  I was expecting the American people to start really getting angry, even back during the exposure of Climategate, when it became unavoidable that government and media and academic institutions were all working together to sell us this hoax of human-caused global warming, to impose a global carbon tax and a global government.
[00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:36.599]  Now we're in the middle of one of the harshest winters in the last 60 years,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.246]  And the global warming cultists are still out there saying, oh no, global warming causes cold weather.
[00:18:42.506 --> 00:18:44.649]  This is all evidence of our agenda is correct.
[00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.935]  They, you know, they're standing there with their hairs on fire and telling us they don't smell any smoke.
[00:18:49.836 --> 00:18:51.057]  And they're caught red-handed.
[00:18:51.738 --> 00:18:52.780]  Or blue-handed in this case.
[00:18:55.012 --> 00:18:55.893]  Absolutely, Mike.
[00:18:55.933 --> 00:19:00.536]  Again, we have another story up at PrisonPlanet.com from No World System.
[00:19:00.816 --> 00:19:08.321]  Full-body scanners to fry travelers with radiation that it has links to all the mainstream government and university documents of how deadly this is.
[00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:13.124]  I mean, this is... I just can't even believe... Imagine, Mike, if you and I had made, say, a
[00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:30.077]  A futuristic sci-fi movie 20 years ago, where the government records naked Americans in 2010, and where they put any food additives to sterilize they want in the food, and where mainstream TV calls for putting lithium, anti-psychotics, in the water, and where the public just takes it.
[00:19:30.438 --> 00:19:35.223]  People would laugh at that and say, that movie's unbelievable, nobody would ever put up with that.
[00:19:36.227 --> 00:19:39.168]  It's just like Brave New World, it would be considered science fiction.
[00:19:39.508 --> 00:19:40.208]  But here we are.
[00:19:40.808 --> 00:19:50.231]  Mike, we're going to come right back to you after the break, continue with what really happened with the underwear bomber, and a lot more, and your ideas of boycotting the airlines and the government.
[00:19:50.451 --> 00:19:52.071]  It's the airlines going along with this.
[00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:54.212]  They're the target we've got to go after politically.
[00:19:54.712 --> 00:19:56.572]  This is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:57.372 --> 00:19:59.333]  It's our second weekday show of the new year.
[00:20:00.939 --> 00:20:05.220]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:13.102]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[00:20:13.342 --> 00:20:28.145]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.
[00:20:28.445 --> 00:20:33.067]  Order the Berkey light system today, complete with two black Berkey elements for only two hundred and nine dollars.
[00:20:33.127 --> 00:20:37.749]  And the Berkey guy will include three sport Berkey water bottles and ship everything to you free of charge.
[00:20:37.969 --> 00:20:38.429]  That's right.
[00:20:38.629 --> 00:20:42.270]  Three sport Berkey water bottles and free shipping and eighty seven dollar value.
[00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.631]  Yours free, but only for a limited time.
[00:20:44.891 --> 00:20:46.952]  Just call the Berkey guy at 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53 now to order.
[00:20:46.972 --> 00:20:48.032]  That's 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53 or order online now at
[00:21:01.013 --> 00:21:01.854]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:02.035 --> 00:21:07.382]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:08.003]  I get it.
[00:21:08.123 --> 00:21:17.477]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:21:17.717 --> 00:21:18.918]  That's not what's happening.
[00:21:19.138 --> 00:21:27.402]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:21:27.602 --> 00:21:30.884]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:21:31.004 --> 00:21:35.086]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:21:35.266 --> 00:21:36.847]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:21:36.887 --> 00:21:40.109]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:21:40.829 --> 00:21:44.431]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:21:44.631 --> 00:21:45.332]  You should, too.
[00:21:45.532 --> 00:21:46.513]  Find out what they know.
[00:21:46.673 --> 00:21:49.915]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:49.975]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.995 --> 00:21:50.035]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.055 --> 00:21:50.536]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.556 --> 00:21:53.118]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:53.138 --> 00:21:54.839]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:54.879 --> 00:21:56.300]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:22:11.224 --> 00:22:13.726]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.746 --> 00:22:19.970]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:25.153]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.653 --> 00:22:35.279]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.399 --> 00:22:37.501]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.741 --> 00:22:39.083]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.343 --> 00:22:41.605]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:43.647]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.907 --> 00:22:48.692]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:49.072 --> 00:22:53.837]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:54.077 --> 00:22:58.181]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:02.533]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[00:23:02.653 --> 00:23:04.374]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[00:23:04.554 --> 00:23:06.316]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[00:23:06.396 --> 00:23:07.737]  We paid off all of our bills.
[00:23:07.837 --> 00:23:10.579]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[00:23:10.619 --> 00:23:16.203]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[00:23:16.263 --> 00:23:17.864]  Even have more money left over each month?
[00:23:17.944 --> 00:23:20.506]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[00:23:20.546 --> 00:23:21.007]  No More Mortgage.
[00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:24.289]  Where have they been all of our life?
[00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:26.771]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.

[00:24:31.335 --> 00:24:38.914]  I swear on the altar of God, eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds and bodies of humanity!
[00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:43.291]  This is the great challenge.
[00:24:43.612 --> 00:24:46.155]  This is a technological enslavement system.
[00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:50.340]  They figured out with Hitler and others that military isn't enough to take over.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.882]  You've got to stage terror attacks.
[00:24:52.202 --> 00:24:53.264]  You've got to scare people.
[00:24:53.304 --> 00:24:54.505]  You've got to bankrupt people.
[00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:56.207]  You've got to pose as their savior.
[00:24:56.447 --> 00:24:57.849]  You've got to get your grit in place.
[00:24:58.009 --> 00:25:01.514]  Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com joins us, Mike.
[00:25:02.677 --> 00:25:06.500]  Continuing, finishing up in this segment with the naked body scanners.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.741]  Admittedly causing DNA damage.
[00:25:09.101 --> 00:25:11.563]  Recording your naked children, your wife, your husband.
[00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:14.965]  Again, acts of submission, making us submit.
[00:25:15.386 --> 00:25:20.049]  Now in England they've put random body scanners in vans driving around.
[00:25:20.629 --> 00:25:23.771]  They go to bars, make people walk through them, guilty until proven innocent.
[00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:27.814]  TSA says everything that goes on in airports will now go on the streets of America.
[00:25:28.074 --> 00:25:29.275]  They said that seven years ago.
[00:25:29.315 --> 00:25:30.316]  That's now rolling out.
[00:25:30.956 --> 00:25:38.488]  With random searches in L.A., in New York, in Boston on New Year's with the police out randomly searching people.
[00:25:38.768 --> 00:25:39.990]  This is hellish, Mike!
[00:25:40.231 --> 00:25:44.457]  This is our way of life being totally overturned because of some underwear bomber.
[00:25:44.537 --> 00:25:45.619]  It's a total fraud!
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.222]  It is absolutely a total fraud.
[00:25:48.342 --> 00:26:00.171]  One little aspect to the case I'm starting to look into right now, supposedly he, whatever happened on that airplane, whether it was an exploding laptop battery or it was really, you know, he's sitting on his own bomb, which makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:26:00.612 --> 00:26:11.841]  I mean, if you really think about it, if he had really wanted to blow up the plane, he would have gone to the laboratory, where he had some privacy, you know, start digging around in his crotch, put it against the wall of the plane and set it up.
[00:26:12.381 --> 00:26:15.823]  He did what he did in the cabin so that he would be seen.
[00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:18.384]  He was there to create a media incident.
[00:26:18.424 --> 00:26:22.085]  Same thing with the shoe bomber doing what he did on the airplane.
[00:26:22.366 --> 00:26:30.109]  They could have gone to the laboratory and accomplished whatever they were doing there if their goal was to really bring down the airplane as opposed to being another hoax.
[00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:33.411]  But here's another circumstance about this situation.
[00:26:34.471 --> 00:26:40.314]  I've been looking back at all the incidents where people have died in the airports because of being tasered by TSA.
[00:26:41.238 --> 00:26:52.406]  We had a very tragic situation here at the Honolulu Airport where a family coming in from another island because they needed to bring their child to the airport.
[00:26:52.446 --> 00:26:56.029]  They came in from Samoa and nobody at the TSA could speak Samoan.
[00:26:56.309 --> 00:27:02.034]  So they locked this family in a room while they try and find a translator and the baby died before they were allowed out.
[00:27:02.334 --> 00:27:07.398]  And I'm thinking about it, more people are dying from TSA than they are from these crotch and shoe bombers.
[00:27:08.398 --> 00:27:10.680]  And nobody seems to really be all that upset about it.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:22.929]  If the goal is to keep Americans safe, who's keeping us safe from all these fast food restaurant rejects who are given a taser and a uniform and rubber gloves and said, go have fun at the airports?
[00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.091]  Yeah, it's an army of fast food minions.
[00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:26.872]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:35.121]  When I've flown in L.A., when I've flown in Austin and other cities, almost every time I fly now, they go, hey Alex, I like your show.
[00:27:35.141 --> 00:27:36.142]  A lot of us are awake.
[00:27:36.162 --> 00:27:36.923]  We know what's going on.
[00:27:36.983 --> 00:27:37.723]  It's just a job.
[00:27:38.224 --> 00:27:39.825]  That has happened over and over again.
[00:27:39.885 --> 00:27:47.092]  So a lot of these are former military or they're people that have lost their job or they're people that worked at the post office, but there are a lot of menial
[00:27:47.853 --> 00:27:48.513]  Thug types.
[00:27:48.613 --> 00:27:53.474]  And how many reports have we seen where they make women drink their own breast milk to prove it's not a liquid bomb?
[00:27:53.834 --> 00:27:59.155]  How many cases have we seen where they arrest people for knitting needles or for a tiny pocket knife?
[00:27:59.776 --> 00:28:10.398]  I had them yell and scream at me in Billings, Montana, flying out from the Hardin situation because I said, oh, I'll just take this tiny bottle of free shampoo at the hotel.
[00:28:11.198 --> 00:28:14.139]  And I went, I said, lady, I said, it's actually on the wall that that's legal.
[00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.859]  And she said, OK, whatever, just get through here.
[00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:20.522]  So, again, it's training us to be abused, that we're criminals.
[00:28:20.962 --> 00:28:22.003]  That's what a tyranny is.
[00:28:22.063 --> 00:28:23.784]  It makes law-abiding people criminals.
[00:28:25.011 --> 00:28:31.633]  Well, there have been a lot of experiments that show that when people are given a little bit of authority, they can become real monsters.
[00:28:31.653 --> 00:28:34.314]  Their dark side comes out, and we're seeing that in all of our airports.
[00:28:34.674 --> 00:28:36.414]  And you're asking, what are we going to do about this?
[00:28:37.355 --> 00:28:48.518]  On the lighter side, I'm trying to find a radio-opaque ink that we can put on t-shirts, so there's a message that only shows up in the scanners that says things like, pervert, or, I told you my dick was bigger than your dick.
[00:28:48.818 --> 00:28:50.979]  Mike, Mike, we have a family audience.
[00:28:50.999 --> 00:28:51.639]  Let's be careful.
[00:28:51.659 --> 00:28:51.879]  Sorry.
[00:28:52.239 --> 00:28:52.859]  Sorry about that.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.500]  Sorry about that.
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:29:05.508]  But no, seriously, we can either do it humorously, but in the long run, I think that we're going to see the airlines just start going out of business because people are not going to want to travel.
[00:29:05.588 --> 00:29:07.249]  And maybe that's somebody's big agenda.
[00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:16.817]  But I think the owners and stockholders in the airline companies are going to realize they're taking in the teeth, as much as the tourism industry is, from all of this abusive behavior at the airport.
[00:29:17.157 --> 00:29:29.287]  And as more and more people realize it is just a hoax to try and train us into accepting that we have no more privacy whatsoever, and they'll begin to understand that what the government is really worried about is a revolution in this country.
[00:29:29.347 --> 00:29:36.313]  And as long as they can keep us stripped naked, and they can read our emails and listen to our phone calls, that we can't plan and organize to do anything
[00:29:36.533 --> 00:29:39.774]  They're trying to domesticate us right now.
[00:29:40.535 --> 00:29:44.516]  Coming up, let's get into the Yemen bombing, the Yemen bomber, the underwear bomber.
[00:29:44.717 --> 00:29:46.157]  Let's get into the economy and a lot more.
[00:29:46.197 --> 00:29:47.178]  Max Keiser coming up.
[00:29:50.699 --> 00:29:51.599]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.680]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.621 --> 00:29:57.322]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.892]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.212 --> 00:30:08.295]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.555 --> 00:30:13.958]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.298 --> 00:30:14.738]  It's true.
[00:30:15.038 --> 00:30:19.601]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:20.442]  Number 3.
[00:30:20.722 --> 00:30:24.025]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:28.068]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.228 --> 00:30:28.789]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:31.411]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:31.791 --> 00:30:35.194]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.474 --> 00:30:35.695]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.255 --> 00:30:40.178]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.398 --> 00:30:45.161]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:49.484]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:00.114 --> 00:31:02.716]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.136 --> 00:31:08.100]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.202]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:10.502 --> 00:31:15.326]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:16.467]  How much do you want?
[00:31:16.687 --> 00:31:17.447]  When do you want it?
[00:31:17.808 --> 00:31:19.409]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:19.709 --> 00:31:20.530]  When will you need it?
[00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.831]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:22.971 --> 00:31:24.092]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.313 --> 00:31:25.654]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:25.854 --> 00:31:26.214]  If there's a
[00:31:26.254 --> 00:31:28.216]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:31:28.376 --> 00:31:30.899]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.099 --> 00:31:34.303]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:34.683 --> 00:31:38.187]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:38.508 --> 00:31:39.489]  How much will you need?
[00:31:39.729 --> 00:31:40.350]  We don't know.
[00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.551]  How much do you want?
[00:31:41.731 --> 00:31:42.472]  All you can get.
[00:31:42.672 --> 00:31:43.333]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:43.754 --> 00:31:44.174]  I think so.
[00:31:59.116 --> 00:32:04.283]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:06.406]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:32:06.506 --> 00:32:08.809]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:32:08.949 --> 00:32:10.812]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:32:11.232 --> 00:32:12.594]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:32:12.854 --> 00:32:13.896]  There is a solution.
[00:32:14.116 --> 00:32:22.139]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:29.602]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:34:18.075 --> 00:34:18.275]  We're good
[00:34:39.813 --> 00:34:41.694]  I'd like to get first-time callers in today.
[00:34:41.714 --> 00:34:43.535]  Head of the line, but we'll take anybody's call.
[00:34:43.575 --> 00:34:47.277]  We're happy to hear from all of you.
[00:34:47.297 --> 00:34:47.537]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:47.838 --> 00:34:49.218]  We're talking with Mike Rivero.
[00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:55.902]  Mike, anything else you want to add about the naked body scanners and what's happening with this and how to boycott it?
[00:34:55.922 --> 00:34:59.764]  Then I want to get into the economy, government-run health care, and a lot more with you today.
[00:34:59.804 --> 00:35:00.345]  Mike Rivero.
[00:35:01.155 --> 00:35:03.697]  Well, I think people are going to boycott these scanners anyway.
[00:35:03.717 --> 00:35:10.321]  I mean, the media is trying to tell us it's no big deal, but there's a lot of very shy people out there who don't like this kind of intrusion.
[00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:11.061]  Shy?
[00:35:11.762 --> 00:35:14.123]  I don't want the government videotaping my genitals!
[00:35:15.164 --> 00:35:16.525]  No, that's exactly my point.
[00:35:16.625 --> 00:35:18.246]  I think people are going to reject this thing.
[00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:20.067]  They're going to avoid going to the airport.
[00:35:20.407 --> 00:35:26.390]  We don't all look like that very attractive young lady that's on that story on your website, and we're like you.
[00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.891]  We don't want the government looking at our body.
[00:35:28.951 --> 00:35:31.232]  It's none of their business if we have not done anything wrong.
[00:35:31.672 --> 00:35:33.713]  I think this is going to be a disaster for air travel.
[00:35:33.913 --> 00:35:35.434]  It's already a disaster for tourism.
[00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:41.897]  I think we're going to see another segment of our economy come crashing down, all to make another few political insiders
[00:35:41.957 --> 00:35:48.399]  Shouldn't there be a criminal investigation of Chertoff and other government officials that are making money off this and the revolving door?
[00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:51.639]  The fact that they're out there pushing it when they're making money from it?
[00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:53.720]  There should be an investigation.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.400]  There should be a prosecution and a trial.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.661]  I don't think we're going to see it under this particular government.
[00:35:58.001 --> 00:36:04.702]  Somewhere down the road we got to look at war crime trials against the last couple of presidents that we've had for all this lying about Iraq.
[00:36:05.423 --> 00:36:06.663]  You know, they're talking about taking...
[00:36:07.363 --> 00:36:10.687]  They're lying three times in the last month about Iran with fake nuke documents.
[00:36:10.948 --> 00:36:14.692]  I mean, all they've done is change the last letter in Iraq to Iran.
[00:36:14.733 --> 00:36:17.116]  They've changed it from a Q to an N.
[00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.051]  Yeah, and you know what's really insulting?
[00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:26.113]  They actually think we, the American people, are going to be dumb enough to fall for the same trick twice in a row.
[00:36:26.433 --> 00:36:28.855]  And it's, you know, it's almost an arrogant insult.
[00:36:29.115 --> 00:36:39.239]  They're sitting up there in their ivory towers in control of the corporate media, and they're saying, we can play the same card again, and they're too afraid to stand up and say, you know, that we know you're lying this time.
[00:36:39.459 --> 00:36:40.760]  They're really counting on that.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:47.803]  But on the other hand, I really think that all of this security scanner and naked body scanners and the rest of it, they're not afraid of some terrorist coming in
[00:36:48.203 --> 00:36:49.704]  Wearing Fruit of the Boom underwear.
[00:36:49.924 --> 00:36:51.925]  They're afraid of we the American people.
[00:36:52.265 --> 00:36:53.686]  This is the symptom I'm seeing.
[00:36:53.746 --> 00:37:02.911]  This is a government that is deathly afraid of the American people even as it continues to need us to provide tax dollars and soldiers for their globalist agenda.
[00:37:04.159 --> 00:37:04.680]  I agree.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.402]  I want to go to calls now quickly with each caller.
[00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:11.466]  Then I want to get into, by the way, here's that MSNBC article you mentioned.
[00:37:12.247 --> 00:37:14.850]  Baby detained dies in Honolulu Airport.
[00:37:16.151 --> 00:37:18.933]  Child had been flown in for emergency heart surgery, officials say.
[00:37:19.494 --> 00:37:27.161]  And all the stories of somebody who can't speak English or argues with them, they taser them to death or they stomp on their head until their neck breaks.
[00:37:27.962 --> 00:37:30.884]  And, I mean, the government is the threat to the people.
[00:37:31.184 --> 00:37:33.826]  Government killed 200 million people in the last century.
[00:37:34.126 --> 00:37:38.309]  The threat is not underwear bombers, and that's staged as well.
[00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:48.516]  But before we go to calls, briefly, you know, Tarpley, Madsen, myself, everybody who's looked at this, this is clearly a false flag drill they conducted.
[00:37:48.536 --> 00:37:55.060]  You've got the sharp-dressed man bringing him on the plane in Amsterdam with no passport, past the body scanners.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.301]  Great point you made.
[00:37:56.901 --> 00:37:57.602]  Uh, about that.
[00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:59.583]  You've got some other man reportedly with a bomb.
[00:38:00.083 --> 00:38:01.664]  Once they got to Detroit, they covered that up.
[00:38:01.684 --> 00:38:03.725]  They've now admitted they covered it up, but won't say why.
[00:38:03.745 --> 00:38:09.048]  Uh, you've got the fact that this happened right as they introduced the scanners, right as they introduced Yemen as the new enemy.
[00:38:09.268 --> 00:38:10.349]  Your take briefly on that.
[00:38:11.164 --> 00:38:12.065]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:14.206]  We've been in Yemen covertly for about a year.
[00:38:14.486 --> 00:38:18.208]  We started actually actively bombing there two, three weeks ago.
[00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:26.213]  Then all of a sudden, right when Obama needs it to justify making the war in Yemen overt, we get the staged terror incident.
[00:38:26.293 --> 00:38:31.056]  It's the same stunt all over again, and it's obvious what he's doing.
[00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:34.038]  I think most Americans understand that this is another hoax.
[00:38:34.058 --> 00:38:38.601]  I think most Americans don't believe that this is authentically an attempted terror attack.
[00:38:39.537 --> 00:38:44.081]  Well, I agree with you that the establishment has bitten off more than they can chew, but they don't care.
[00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:46.123]  They don't care if we're against open borders.
[00:38:46.143 --> 00:38:47.845]  They don't care if we don't want more gun control.
[00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:50.427]  They don't care if we don't want the banks to loot us and rob us.
[00:38:50.667 --> 00:38:51.208]  They don't care.
[00:38:51.288 --> 00:38:52.069]  They just do it!
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.421]  They do it because it's making them money.
[00:38:55.521 --> 00:38:56.641]  It's getting them more power.
[00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.842]  They're thinking very, very short term.
[00:38:58.922 --> 00:39:02.484]  I think most of the insiders understand it's not going to go on much longer.
[00:39:02.804 --> 00:39:11.027]  So they're doing whatever they can do to suck as much money out of the population and put it in their pocket before they skedaddle down to the Caymans as everything starts to fall apart.
[00:39:11.067 --> 00:39:13.669]  I think we're seeing almost an economic bug out.
[00:39:13.869 --> 00:39:16.850]  They're grabbing the money and the silverware and they're heading for the border.
[00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:19.351]  I think we're in that loot the nation phase right now.
[00:39:19.491 --> 00:39:26.112]  Oh, there's no doubt of that, and leaving a vanguard, rearguard of paramilitary police to run around and feed on us.
[00:39:26.752 --> 00:39:28.673]  Let's talk to Andy in California.
[00:39:28.793 --> 00:39:29.653]  Andy, you're on the air.
[00:39:30.813 --> 00:39:39.694]  Hello, this is Andy out in California, and I just want to talk to you about the American Disabilities Act and the lack of access for people with dyslexia and attention deficit disorder.
[00:39:39.894 --> 00:39:48.616]  And just by us using our auxiliary aid of a tape recorder, it makes us an enemy of the county, state, and federal government because it returns a quarter record to the people.
[00:39:49.957 --> 00:39:55.662]  That's right, the government tries to say people can't record government, but then they can all record and surveil us.
[00:39:55.702 --> 00:40:00.666]  They get rid of our basic rights, criminally, and then declare unconstitutional powers for themselves.
[00:40:00.726 --> 00:40:03.128]  Andy, I appreciate your call, but we're not on the Disabilities Act.
[00:40:03.188 --> 00:40:06.731]  I mean, it's kind of open phones, but I just can't, I've got to move on.
[00:40:07.051 --> 00:40:09.473]  Geronimo in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:40:11.144 --> 00:40:11.704]  How's it going?
[00:40:11.744 --> 00:40:15.047]  I just got a call this morning from a contractor that I know.
[00:40:15.067 --> 00:40:17.428]  He poured cement out of Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:17.488 --> 00:40:24.452]  They've just been given the okay to go ahead and take down a bunch of redwood trees and start building helipads.
[00:40:24.553 --> 00:40:25.713]  I saw that in the news!
[00:40:25.773 --> 00:40:32.217]  So the elites can land in Santa Rosa and fly by helicopter out there to have their homosexual conservative orgies.
[00:40:32.998 --> 00:40:33.938]  That's right, Alex.
[00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:36.580]  It looks like now they're not going to have to listen to us.
[00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:38.794]  See us?
[00:40:38.814 --> 00:40:39.795]  See our ugly face?
[00:40:39.835 --> 00:40:44.718]  We'll just fly right in and go ahead and do their rituals and their little homosexual toys.
[00:40:45.018 --> 00:40:46.459]  So, I just wanted to put that out to you.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.040]  Thank you for waking me up.
[00:40:48.481 --> 00:40:52.483]  I am Oathkeeper, and I'm here in Northern California trying to spread the word.
[00:40:52.603 --> 00:40:53.264]  Thank you, my man.
[00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:53.984]  Great.
[00:40:54.165 --> 00:40:58.028]  A lot of police officers and military becoming Oath Keepers and Three Percenters.
[00:40:58.969 --> 00:41:00.891]  And again, I'm not bashing gay people.
[00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:12.882]  The point I'm making is, Bohemian Grove is where your mainline Christian conservative leaders go, on record, to have top gay porn stars flown in to have drug-induced orgies.
[00:41:13.262 --> 00:41:14.123]  And it's on record.
[00:41:14.463 --> 00:41:18.867]  Again, it's a group of lawless lunatics who now want to record your children.
[00:41:19.568 --> 00:41:21.910]  And remember, they told us torture was good.
[00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.951]  I want to make that point for the last hour when I go over it.
[00:41:24.932 --> 00:41:28.294]  That torture's good, and Jack Bauer is our hero.
[00:41:29.114 --> 00:41:32.256]  And then now, videotaping, body scanning your children is good.
[00:41:32.517 --> 00:41:35.358]  And remember, the White House reviewed the torture videos and photo.
[00:41:35.639 --> 00:41:37.260]  So did Congress, but didn't release them.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.142]  I'm sure they enjoyed that, Mike Rivera.
[00:41:41.002 --> 00:41:46.690]  Well, did you see Wayne Madsen's new report on Russia today where they're talking about U.S.
[00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:56.905]  diplomats and congressmen going on these fact-finding missions to Thailand and they're engaging in child sex over there and it's just completely out of control and normally I would
[00:41:57.305 --> 00:42:26.705]  Hold off on a story like that, but I remember I was living in Seattle when there was this huge scandal over the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference where the FBI was bugging the conference attendees stealing business secrets to give to cronies and there were children underage children being provided to some of the conference attendees for sexual purposes and it turned out there was actually a fund at the State Department for this kind of stuff and you know so it's like this we've got this one set of rules that we're all supposed to live by and you know think about the
[00:42:27.005 --> 00:42:27.365]  We're good to go.
[00:42:45.734 --> 00:42:50.317]  Child porn, they've just gotten the kids out, and the government shut that investigation down.
[00:42:50.437 --> 00:42:54.079]  I mean, these people are the most sinister, murdering criminals.
[00:42:54.419 --> 00:43:15.132]  Look at how Halliburton, DynCorp, the UN have all been caught running giant child kidnapping operations, and now they have expanded diplomatic immunity through Interpol in the U.S., and so the Justice Department just went under Interpol, so all their records are secret, and they have diplomatic immunity, and how many times has the UN been caught under diplomatic immunity trafficking in children?
[00:43:15.982 --> 00:43:18.145]  It really is completely out of control.
[00:43:18.205 --> 00:43:19.947]  It just seems like the wrong sort of people.
[00:43:19.987 --> 00:43:21.068]  See, they bypass all the scanners.
[00:43:21.269 --> 00:43:22.751]  They just drive right on to the airports.
[00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:24.201]  Yeah, they do.
[00:43:24.241 --> 00:43:25.442]  They've got their own jets.
[00:43:25.482 --> 00:43:26.943]  They've got all their private airplanes.
[00:43:26.963 --> 00:43:29.584]  They've got the private terminals that they go through.
[00:43:29.604 --> 00:43:31.045]  They don't go through any of this stuff.
[00:43:31.325 --> 00:43:32.946]  And they're carrying drugs with them.
[00:43:33.766 --> 00:43:34.907]  Think Iran-Contra.
[00:43:35.207 --> 00:43:37.068]  It's open season on the American people.
[00:43:37.168 --> 00:43:45.292]  We're all being controlled and enslaved so that the government, with their special access and their private access and their private security, they can come and go as they will.
[00:43:45.352 --> 00:43:46.413]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:43:46.753 --> 00:43:51.694]  I don't know if you saw this story where this mayor got caught on videotape stealing ladies undies.
[00:43:52.074 --> 00:43:56.815]  The problem with power, with political power, is it's going to attract the wrong kind of people.
[00:43:57.075 --> 00:44:00.176]  It attracts the people who shouldn't have it, and we allow it to happen.
[00:44:00.216 --> 00:44:11.438]  How many scumbags in business and life have you ran into who just want to do bad, who just want to steal, who just want to cheat, who enjoy lying, who enjoy playing the victim, who enjoy manipulating people?
[00:44:11.798 --> 00:44:12.098]  That's
[00:44:12.498 --> 00:44:20.777]  What we've got is a competition of the greatest scum to get into positions of power with each other so the very worst get into control.
[00:44:21.877 --> 00:44:31.002]  Well, the problem is that, you know, all of the rules and all of the morality is just something they see as being used to control the masses, and they never believe that it applies to them.
[00:44:31.363 --> 00:44:39.387]  They answer to a higher authority, or they think Adam Smith was absolutely right, that you can be a total greedy person, and somehow you're benefiting the system as a whole.
[00:44:39.768 --> 00:44:46.511]  Obviously, looking at our current economy, that was completely false, but they still want to subscribe to that theory, just as they're still clinging to global warming.
[00:44:46.571 --> 00:44:47.172]  And it's all lies!
[00:44:47.472 --> 00:44:49.573]  They keep telling us that the economy's great.
[00:44:49.973 --> 00:44:51.194]  I have a stack right here.
[00:44:51.534 --> 00:44:51.974]  Reuters.
[00:44:52.134 --> 00:44:52.454]  U.S.
[00:44:52.794 --> 00:44:55.476]  growth prospects deemed bleak in new decade.
[00:44:55.496 --> 00:44:57.156]  Our GDP plunges.
[00:44:57.497 --> 00:45:00.478]  Personal bankruptcy filings rising fast to record level.
[00:45:00.498 --> 00:45:01.338]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:45:01.759 --> 00:45:02.939]  Economic Policy Journal.
[00:45:02.999 --> 00:45:04.580]  Robert Rubin, the main culprit.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.141]  All hell could break loose because of huge government debt.
[00:45:07.381 --> 00:45:08.902]  They want a new excise tax.
[00:45:09.242 --> 00:45:10.803]  They want a new value-added tax.
[00:45:10.823 --> 00:45:13.284]  They have Glenn Beck calling for it, calling it conservative.
[00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:18.407]  We've got American job satisfaction falls to record low, to only 45%.
[00:45:20.208 --> 00:45:24.230]  We've got editorial hiding health bills behind closed doors.
[00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.691]  Washington Times, U.S.
[00:45:25.731 --> 00:45:29.653]  News & World Report, Democratic leaders plan secret health care reform deliberations.
[00:45:30.013 --> 00:45:30.874]  Everything's secret.
[00:45:31.354 --> 00:45:32.294]  Everything's criminal.
[00:45:32.555 --> 00:45:34.576]  They just do whatever they want!
[00:45:35.546 --> 00:45:44.519]  And they're telling us the economy's wonderful, as everyone I know is losing their job, getting pay cuts, everything's falling apart, and the media's saying, we're gonna naked body scan you!
[00:45:45.816 --> 00:45:53.642]  What we have right now, the only part of the economy that looks good is the Dow Industrial Averages, and we're seeing more and more indications that that is being manipulated.
[00:45:53.682 --> 00:45:55.124]  The Plunge Protection Team is in there.
[00:45:55.364 --> 00:45:55.804]  The U.S.
[00:45:55.924 --> 00:46:01.529]  government is buying stocks in order to drive up their value so they can use the Dow as a political banner.
[00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:02.129]  See?
[00:46:02.169 --> 00:46:03.090]  The economy's good.
[00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.851]  The Dow is up.
[00:46:04.191 --> 00:46:06.473]  If you're not doing well, it's your own fault.
[00:46:06.733 --> 00:46:09.375]  But they popped 28-plus trill.
[00:46:09.415 --> 00:46:11.377]  They just admitted 4 trillion more on top of the 23.7 trill.
[00:46:12.918 --> 00:46:14.986]  So it comes up to right at 28 Trill.
[00:46:15.207 --> 00:46:18.379]  They've pumped 28 Trill of our money into their own investments!
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.861]  That's absolutely true.
[00:46:22.463 --> 00:46:24.204]  Goldman Sachs is keeping the bonuses.
[00:46:24.284 --> 00:46:26.005]  Obama promised he was going to get those back.
[00:46:26.025 --> 00:46:26.446]  Record profits!
[00:46:26.486 --> 00:46:29.788]  We get their internal documents, how they engineered the whole thing.
[00:46:29.808 --> 00:46:31.430]  McClatchy Newspapers admits it.
[00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:33.171]  I mean, this is hell on earth!
[00:46:33.872 --> 00:46:38.015]  They made a huge fortune helping to destroy the American economy.
[00:46:38.676 --> 00:46:40.117]  What is the goal here of the government?
[00:46:40.177 --> 00:46:42.198]  Are they trying to crash the U.S.
[00:46:42.218 --> 00:46:42.419]  economy?
[00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:43.079]  Yes, look at the U.N.
[00:46:43.139 --> 00:46:48.363]  saying they want to deindustrialize, paying to move steel mills and power plants out of the U.S.
[00:46:48.403 --> 00:46:48.844]  to India.
[00:46:50.149 --> 00:46:53.171]  And we're left out without any manufacturing.
[00:46:53.271 --> 00:46:56.152]  We're left with SWAT teams running around urinating on us.
[00:46:57.373 --> 00:46:59.113]  What are we supposed to do to pay our bills?
[00:46:59.153 --> 00:47:02.955]  That's the part that really makes it look like the government wanted the economy to crash.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:03.716]  They want a rebellion.
[00:47:03.776 --> 00:47:04.836]  They want a rebellion.
[00:47:04.876 --> 00:47:05.757]  They want violence.
[00:47:05.777 --> 00:47:06.497]  They're gonna get it.
[00:47:06.597 --> 00:47:07.317]  They're gonna get it.
[00:47:07.698 --> 00:47:10.499]  I don't like violence, but it does seem like we're headed in that direction.
[00:47:11.399 --> 00:47:12.760]  It's a master plan, Kurt.
[00:47:13.661 --> 00:47:18.043]  I'm telling you, man, I can't... Somebody just popped in my ear.
[00:47:18.083 --> 00:47:18.383]  What's that?
[00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:22.407]  I was just thinking about sending a story to Kurt Nemo.
[00:47:22.447 --> 00:47:23.227]  That's why I called him Kurt.
[00:47:23.247 --> 00:47:24.368]  Yeah, I know he's Mike Rivero.
[00:47:25.348 --> 00:47:28.729]  Well, I'm here telling my few writers I've got post this, post that.
[00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:31.390]  Whenever you're talking, I'm hitting the button saying post this, give me that.
[00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.811]  I mean, the problem is we've got so much evidence, Mike.
[00:47:34.492 --> 00:47:34.732]  Yes.
[00:47:35.712 --> 00:47:39.554]  What we need is anger in the people, and I'm still amazed that we're not getting it.
[00:47:40.774 --> 00:47:42.435]  I just don't even know what to do anymore, Mike.
[00:47:42.635 --> 00:47:47.237]  I just... Let's talk to who's up next here.
[00:47:49.136 --> 00:47:51.279]  Mark in California, you're on the air with Mike Rivero.
[00:47:51.299 --> 00:47:51.700]  Go ahead.
[00:47:53.282 --> 00:47:53.543]  Alex.
[00:47:54.103 --> 00:47:54.464]  Hey, buddy.
[00:47:55.225 --> 00:47:55.726]  Hey, man.
[00:47:55.826 --> 00:47:57.208]  Thanks so much for all you're doing.
[00:47:57.989 --> 00:48:05.440]  I was thinking of what to say, you know, as I heard a few moments before I came on the air, but seriously, this is all so far gone.
[00:48:06.582 --> 00:48:11.547]  Uh, I just, I can't even, um, I can't even react to any of these things anymore.
[00:48:11.567 --> 00:48:14.730]  Well, they hope we just get that far gone and just kind of give up.
[00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.294]  No, we have to stand up and go, this is the moment when they really come out in the open.
[00:48:18.514 --> 00:48:20.376]  We gotta go, you're criminal degenerates!
[00:48:20.616 --> 00:48:21.337]  You're criminals!
[00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:22.038]  You're criminals!
[00:48:22.058 --> 00:48:23.079]  You're, just chant it!
[00:48:23.319 --> 00:48:24.240]  You are criminals!
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.221]  You are illegitimate!
[00:48:25.461 --> 00:48:26.563]  You are tyrannous!
[00:48:26.623 --> 00:48:27.604]  You are tyrannical!
[00:48:27.924 --> 00:48:29.165]  We do not recognize you.
[00:48:29.205 --> 00:48:29.965]  You are criminals.
[00:48:30.005 --> 00:48:31.485]  You are staging the terror attacks.
[00:48:31.766 --> 00:48:33.306]  You engineered the economic collapse.
[00:48:33.346 --> 00:48:36.187]  You threatened martial law if the banks weren't given total power.
[00:48:36.427 --> 00:48:37.248]  You are criminals.
[00:48:37.268 --> 00:48:38.028]  You are criminals.
[00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:38.788]  You are criminals.
[00:48:38.808 --> 00:48:39.469]  You are criminals.
[00:48:39.749 --> 00:48:42.450]  Until everybody starts chanting, you are criminals.
[00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.051]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:48:44.751 --> 00:48:51.113]  My class is here at the university, so I just read an article calling this last decade the lost decade.
[00:48:51.674 --> 00:48:53.614]  And I completely disagree with that.
[00:48:53.674 --> 00:48:57.596]  I think the next one coming, the one we just entered, is going to be the lost decade for sure.
[00:48:58.328 --> 00:49:03.111]  And we're starting to see all the signs of the mobilization towards this world government.
[00:49:03.992 --> 00:49:07.414]  You've been covering, it's all coming together right now.
[00:49:08.869 --> 00:49:17.572]  World government is out in the open and I'll be at the park with my kids and some yuppie will walk over and start laughing at me saying you're a kook.
[00:49:17.952 --> 00:49:21.353]  These fools have no idea what's happening to them.
[00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:33.636]  Mike Rivera, what do you call this sick psychology where people making $100,000 a year think they're part of the elite and think if they just psychologically buddy up to the tyranny and make a joke out of it that it's somehow funny and cute?
[00:49:34.926 --> 00:49:37.008]  Well, I call it the Good German Syndrome.
[00:49:37.308 --> 00:49:42.232]  And, you know, because there were people in Germany who wanted to be cozy and buddy-buddy with Hitler.
[00:49:42.252 --> 00:49:43.053]  That didn't work out.
[00:49:43.353 --> 00:49:45.755]  Stalin used to call people like that useful idiots.
[00:49:46.155 --> 00:49:47.456]  Every society has them.
[00:49:47.736 --> 00:49:49.698]  They're in denial about what's going on.
[00:49:49.978 --> 00:49:55.143]  They're like abused children, where they think, if I just go along with the abuse, maybe it won't get any worse.
[00:49:55.183 --> 00:50:02.989]  And, of course, history shows that, yeah, when you go along with being abused, it is going to get worse, because abusers don't know how to control themselves.
[00:50:07.932 --> 00:50:08.912]  You know what that is, Mike?
[00:50:09.553 --> 00:50:10.193]  Absolutely.
[00:50:10.213 --> 00:50:17.518]  Well, it's abuse child syndrome, where abused children will work to protect the abusing parent and to defend them and to justify them.
[00:50:17.718 --> 00:50:21.240]  And that's exactly where we are, with a huge segment of the American population.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.802]  And I think the government planners are relying on that.
[00:50:25.202 --> 00:50:29.345]  And they're figuring that if they start to abuse us more and more and more, that people will just say,
[00:50:30.305 --> 00:50:31.686]  You know, I'm being a good American.
[00:50:31.726 --> 00:50:32.646]  Don't abuse me anymore.
[00:50:32.686 --> 00:50:33.447]  I won't say anything.
[00:50:33.467 --> 00:50:34.227]  I won't complain.
[00:50:34.707 --> 00:50:35.187]  And it is.
[00:50:35.227 --> 00:50:36.908]  It's a classic abuse child pattern.
[00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:42.051]  Well, it's like kids, I would see, getting beat up when they got off the school bus, putting up with it.
[00:50:42.131 --> 00:50:43.792]  And the bullies came like flies.
[00:50:44.432 --> 00:50:44.932]  Not me.
[00:50:44.992 --> 00:50:47.874]  Bullies ran when they saw me, because I'm like, hey, you may be bigger than me.
[00:50:47.894 --> 00:50:48.554]  You want some?
[00:50:48.974 --> 00:50:52.796]  I mean, I don't understand the love of cowardice, the love of rolling over.
[00:50:53.096 --> 00:50:53.977]  I don't have courage.
[00:50:54.537 --> 00:50:55.637]  I am just not a slave.
[00:50:55.737 --> 00:50:56.678]  I'm a real human.
[00:50:56.898 --> 00:50:58.539]  I'm ready to stand up.
[00:51:00.256 --> 00:51:01.497]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.537 --> 00:51:06.903]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.144 --> 00:51:11.769]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.149 --> 00:51:12.550]  It's true.
[00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.213]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:51:15.453 --> 00:51:17.195]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:17.715 --> 00:51:22.420]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:29.867]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:30.067 --> 00:51:30.968]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:37.494]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.941]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:51:44.222 --> 00:51:44.422]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:44.462 --> 00:51:47.343]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:47.843 --> 00:51:49.584]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[00:52:59.847 --> 00:53:03.448]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:53:03.628 --> 00:53:13.632]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.

[00:54:05.822 --> 00:54:12.044]  My websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:12.844 --> 00:54:26.067]  And we have bibliographies online at FallTheRepublic.net, TheObamaDeception.com, WhatIsTheEndGame.com, where we document everything we claim.
[00:54:28.339 --> 00:54:30.560]  We have to stop rolling over to this tyranny.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:33.202]  Stop capitulating to it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:34.062 --> 00:54:35.283]  And I do see people waking up.
[00:54:35.343 --> 00:54:36.423]  I do see people getting angry.
[00:54:37.024 --> 00:54:43.627]  And Chertoff and others already made the deals to some numbers that are as high as $9 billion for these scanners and other systems.
[00:54:44.367 --> 00:54:50.951]  I mean, this is just outrageous to see them out in the open doing this, making money, enslaving us, Mike.
[00:54:52.102 --> 00:54:52.402]  It is.
[00:54:52.542 --> 00:54:55.384]  It's just absolutely, it's very depressing to see.
[00:54:55.664 --> 00:55:01.206]  But you were talking in the last segment about standing up and saying, I'm not going to be a slave anymore.
[00:55:01.566 --> 00:55:09.790]  And I keep thinking about what is the institution that we have in our society that is always teaching us to be on our knees and to turn the other cheek and not fight back.
[00:55:10.131 --> 00:55:14.633]  And it seems to be organized religion, which may explain why they get all these tax breaks from the government.
[00:55:15.053 --> 00:55:17.194]  And it almost seems sometimes like religion
[00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:25.119]  Organized commercial religion is definitely on the side of the government where they're working to try and talk us out of fighting back against our president.
[00:55:25.139 --> 00:55:32.984]  Oh yeah, clergy response teams, faith-based initiative in the last nine years has completely taken over all the denominations and we got the secret documents.
[00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:34.285]  Now mainstream media admits it.
[00:55:34.526 --> 00:55:37.868]  The preachers are training their flocks quote for martial law.
[00:55:38.683 --> 00:55:41.604]  Yeah, render unto Caesar and all the rest of that.
[00:55:42.004 --> 00:55:45.204]  So we need to recognize that those churches, they're part of the problem.
[00:55:45.524 --> 00:55:47.465]  They are not working for the freedom of the people.
[00:55:47.485 --> 00:55:56.467]  I think one of the Popes once said, there never should have been a Bill of Rights because God does not grant to man rights of freedom of speech and freedom of movement.
[00:55:57.527 --> 00:55:58.227]  Unbelievable.
[00:55:58.347 --> 00:56:01.448]  And now the Pope's calling for a global tax for the environment.
[00:56:02.408 --> 00:56:05.328]  It's just world governments being openly called for.
[00:56:05.348 --> 00:56:07.609]  I mean, this is just outrageous.
[00:56:08.777 --> 00:56:09.757]  It really, really is.
[00:56:09.817 --> 00:56:24.561]  The only good news is that the failure of the When Pigs Fly flu to become the scourge that it was promised, the failure of the human-caused global warming agenda, those were two of the three pillars on which the foundation for global government was being built.
[00:56:24.801 --> 00:56:29.282]  So they're in serious trouble right now, because the credibility of global government
[00:56:29.562 --> 00:56:30.062]  We're good to go!
[00:56:54.856 --> 00:56:59.479]  Is going to give you the energy and enthusiasm to do what needs to be done to secure your freedoms.
[00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:00.840]  Government never makes you free.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.122]  You have to take your freedom from the government.
[00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:05.432]  Well, expanding on that, you're right.
[00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:09.236]  They've tried the fake global warming, they're still moving forward on that, but they're damaged.
[00:57:09.736 --> 00:57:14.361]  They tried the fake swine flu, that blew up in their face, a big disaster for them.
[00:57:14.621 --> 00:57:19.605]  All this news in Europe of indictments and corruption at the UN, fear-mongering it with companies to make money.
[00:57:20.366 --> 00:57:26.031]  And so they're falling back on terror, but it's come out that Ridge, the last Homeland Security head, admitted
[00:57:26.852 --> 00:57:29.134]  That it was all fake and done for political purposes.
[00:57:29.274 --> 00:57:30.475]  We have the facts.
[00:57:30.895 --> 00:57:31.996]  We have the proof.
[00:57:32.477 --> 00:57:38.822]  And for all of you yuppies and people that haven't spoken up or people that are awake who haven't gotten involved, you better do it quick, folks.
[00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:41.484]  This is serious tyranny we're dealing with.
[00:57:41.944 --> 00:57:43.246]  This isn't your mama's tyranny.
[00:57:43.546 --> 00:57:45.948]  This is a high-tech, really vicious tyranny.
[00:57:46.268 --> 00:57:47.489]  And don't say you weren't warned.
[00:57:47.509 --> 00:57:54.275]  You know, in the end, we're going to win, Mike, even though things are going to get a lot worse, because you and I and countless others have planted the seeds
[00:57:54.875 --> 00:57:58.636]  Absolutely true and the main thing is people are recognizing the government is lying.
[00:57:58.716 --> 00:58:03.637]  They're looking for somebody to tell them what's really going on and of course they're coming to our radio shows and our websites.
[00:58:23.874 --> 00:58:24.835]  Mike, you're awesome.

[00:58:26.797 --> 00:58:38.528]  Keep up the great work and it's good to be working with you and exposing and developing this boycott of the airlines and others to stop these naked body scanners like we stopped the global warming fraud and the flu fraud.

[00:59:55.282 --> 00:59:58.064]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.597 --> 01:00:05.238]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.898 --> 01:00:06.939]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:08.780]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.241]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.002 --> 01:00:11.962]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.563 --> 01:00:16.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:20.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.679 --> 01:00:33.127]  Well, he invented the Hollywood Stock Exchange and a lot of the systems used on modern stock markets today.
[01:00:33.148 --> 01:00:39.337]  He's a very successful broker, TV host on British television, Russian television.
[01:00:39.978 --> 01:00:41.500]  The list goes on and on.
[01:00:42.121 --> 01:00:42.382]  Author.
[01:00:43.343 --> 01:00:46.446]  Researcher, filmmaker, Max Keiser.
[01:00:46.466 --> 01:00:47.707]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:54.052]  We're going to talk about the whole new launch of an operation in Yemen that they were launching the last few months.
[01:00:54.092 --> 01:00:56.614]  Kicking off with the underwear bomber, the naked body scanners.
[01:00:57.655 --> 01:00:59.717]  We're going to get into what's really happening with the economy.
[01:00:59.817 --> 01:01:06.923]  Robert Rubin, one of the chief architects of the economic implosion by design, saying we need new taxes or we're all sunk.
[01:01:07.023 --> 01:01:09.765]  Taxes pay to the banks in interest on money we gave them.
[01:01:10.746 --> 01:01:14.689]  We're going to talk about the government takeover of healthcare that even Howard Dean says is a rip-off.
[01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.971]  It's all coming up with Max Keiser.
[01:01:17.912 --> 01:01:22.015]  But Max, I've been talking the last two hours about the capitulation to tyranny.
[01:01:22.035 --> 01:01:23.096]  The naked body scanners.
[01:01:23.376 --> 01:01:27.659]  The London Guardian saying new scanners break child porn laws.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.541]  The articles we have up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:30.942 --> 01:01:32.663]  A call to action to boycott this.
[01:01:33.484 --> 01:01:34.885]  Max Keiser, good to have you with us.
[01:01:35.603 --> 01:01:37.844]  Yeah, Alex Jones, Happy New Year!
[01:01:38.124 --> 01:01:45.527]  You know, this is a continuation of what I've been talking about, what I call the casino gulag model.
[01:01:46.127 --> 01:01:59.292]  The casino part, of course, is that the stocks in all these body scanning machines have skyrocketed, a couple of them up 25% recently, and that's the whole casino aspect of the economy.
[01:01:59.352 --> 01:02:03.173]  And the people who are behind these attacks, of course, are
[01:02:04.013 --> 01:02:12.441]  Professional speculators, gamblers, stock market players, and this goes all the way back to 2001 and the 9-11 incident.
[01:02:12.461 --> 01:02:20.048]  We've got professional speculators who are involved in all these incidents, and they're making big, big, big, big bucks.
[01:02:20.629 --> 01:02:25.213]  And the legislation is always about making it easier for speculators.
[01:02:26.147 --> 01:02:26.748]  I don't know.
[01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:50.603]  So the casino economy is eating the final remnants of the real economy and they're making all their profits in the run-up to total control of society.
[01:03:08.393 --> 01:03:09.273]  Pretty much.
[01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:16.917]  You know, they want to make 100% on their money in five weeks instead of five months or a year or two years.
[01:03:17.317 --> 01:03:20.579]  You know, it's always faster to make money on crashes.
[01:03:21.372 --> 01:03:22.973]  Then it is to make money on the way up.
[01:03:22.993 --> 01:03:29.218]  You know, markets tend to crash faster than they build up over time because fear is a lot more powerful than faith.
[01:03:29.698 --> 01:03:32.940]  And when people get frightened, they sell indiscriminately.
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.942]  And you see market crashes are huge opportunities to make money.
[01:03:36.282 --> 01:03:47.030]  But now we're seeing kind of a new play where the fear this time is driving money into these scanning machines and this whole infrastructure of the gulag.
[01:03:48.099 --> 01:03:51.662]  Which you've seen dramatically on Wall Street, there's huge profits being made.
[01:03:52.423 --> 01:04:16.922]  And on the comment to the scanning machines and this idea that they violate child porn laws and this type of thing, you know, I hearken back to a piece that was written by Naomi Wolf back in July of 2008, where she talks about the whole Abu Ghraib prison scandal was in part driven by the Bush White House
[01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:18.130]  I think so.
[01:04:41.967 --> 01:04:43.227]  It's an act of submission.
[01:04:43.268 --> 01:04:48.109]  If you can make people hurt their kids through, openly be scanned naked, you can get anything you want.
[01:04:48.189 --> 01:04:49.149]  Max Keiser, stay there.
[01:04:49.209 --> 01:04:49.870]  Let's continue.
[01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.490]  Calls coming up and a lot more.
[01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:53.871]  Your Financial Look into 2010.
[01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:56.832]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[01:04:59.653 --> 01:05:03.635]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:05:03.755 --> 01:05:06.497]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:05:06.617 --> 01:05:08.578]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[01:05:10.959 --> 01:05:12.480]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:16.942]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:05:59.434 --> 01:06:03.656]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:03.976 --> 01:06:08.059]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:13.722]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.062 --> 01:06:14.522]  It's true.
[01:06:14.802 --> 01:06:19.365]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:19.665 --> 01:06:20.206]  Number 3.
[01:06:20.486 --> 01:06:23.789]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:27.814]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:27.994 --> 01:06:28.254]  Number 4.
[01:06:28.795 --> 01:06:31.177]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.558 --> 01:06:34.961]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:35.442]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.022 --> 01:06:39.945]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.145 --> 01:06:44.929]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:49.252]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:07:01.087 --> 01:07:04.728]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:05.048 --> 01:07:13.190]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:07:13.911 --> 01:07:17.952]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:18.532 --> 01:07:29.355]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:07:29.995 --> 01:07:38.998]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:08:04.972 --> 01:08:09.133]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[01:08:09.793 --> 01:08:10.613]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.373 --> 01:08:12.313]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.333 --> 01:08:16.534]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.134 --> 01:08:21.235]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.716 --> 01:08:29.697]  At PrisonPlanet.com, in the Featured News section,
[01:08:32.665 --> 01:08:36.589]  Are several of the most important articles I have ever posted.
[01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:37.810]  Written by Paul Watson.
[01:08:39.471 --> 01:08:42.494]  Airports set to become primary peddlers of child porn.
[01:08:42.834 --> 01:08:46.157]  If you doubt me, here is the London Guardian today.
[01:08:46.658 --> 01:08:48.760]  New scanners break child porn laws.
[01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:57.208]  Now, every day, without even looking, because there's so many thousands of people being charged under this, at the public schools they confiscate
[01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:09.073]  Teenagers cameras, their phones that are cameras, and they look through them and how many 16, 17, 15 year old girls send a topless picture to their boyfriend?
[01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:11.514]  How many?
[01:09:13.474 --> 01:09:13.834]  A lot.
[01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:18.435]  And they charge her and the boyfriend they send it to for child pornography.
[01:09:19.116 --> 01:09:20.116]  But then the government
[01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:24.160]  videotapes this and saves it and it's A-OK.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.785]  But in England they're saying we gotta change the laws for child porn to allow this.
[01:09:28.406 --> 01:09:31.970]  That article needs to get out to everyone virally so everyone knows what's happening.
[01:09:33.027 --> 01:09:35.871]  Another big story written today where I break it all down.
[01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:40.276]  Alex Jones calls for massive resistance to implementation of body scanners.
[01:09:40.316 --> 01:09:45.842]  Next hour I'm going to break all this down, open the phones only on this subject for your ideas of the boycott.
[01:09:46.363 --> 01:09:51.689]  I've got a good idea because I know the legal system and how these airports are set up and how they're doing this, their color of law.
[01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:54.863]  If Max Keiser's got an idea, he's welcome to tell us.
[01:09:54.883 --> 01:09:56.585]  Do we go after the stock peddlers of this?
[01:09:57.645 --> 01:09:59.226]  Do we go after the companies?
[01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:02.969]  Do people sue Chertoff, who makes money off this, running around promoting it?
[01:10:03.349 --> 01:10:03.809]  What do we do?
[01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:08.332]  Then we're going to look at the economy and take your phone calls and get into government-run health care.
[01:10:08.732 --> 01:10:10.033]  Max Keiser, continuing.
[01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:18.679]  Oh yeah, well I had Dr. Bruce Levine on my show last week and he talked about something called the abuse syndrome.
[01:10:19.552 --> 01:10:41.159]  And what this means, basically, is that as people sit back and watch their government sexually humiliate them in public, without any recourse, without anyone doing anything, it creates a feedback loop of continued depression and a feeling of helplessness, and that's the same kind of mentality you find in any abusive situation.
[01:10:42.519 --> 01:10:43.240]  We're good.
[01:10:58.053 --> 01:11:03.997]  On a wholesale level, to satisfy some sick sexual tendencies.
[01:11:04.057 --> 01:11:19.966]  Again, from paragraph 4 of this Naomi Wolf article, she says the sexualization of torture from the top in Washington basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay into an organized sex crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were U.S.
[01:11:19.986 --> 01:11:20.787]  held prisoners.
[01:11:21.752 --> 01:11:23.253]  So that was the U.S.
[01:11:23.293 --> 01:11:23.974]  getting a taste.
[01:11:24.474 --> 01:11:26.856]  And notice, Max, Max, we're all on the same page.
[01:11:27.036 --> 01:11:29.098]  I said all this in the first hour.
[01:11:29.378 --> 01:11:30.659]  Hadn't heard what you had to say.
[01:11:30.739 --> 01:11:32.300]  Hadn't read Naomi Wolf's article.
[01:11:34.202 --> 01:11:36.183]  Mike Rivera hadn't heard what I had to say.
[01:11:36.203 --> 01:11:38.205]  He said the exact same thing.
[01:11:38.265 --> 01:11:39.526]  The Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:11:40.346 --> 01:11:41.987]  Now, you're saying the exact same thing.
[01:11:42.007 --> 01:11:48.690]  The expert you interviewed, tell us more about him, and perhaps we'll play a clip of that video if you tell us the name of the video at MaxKaiser.com.
[01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:52.271]  You've got so many TV shows on so many networks, it's hard to know which one to pull up.
[01:11:52.571 --> 01:11:54.032]  But here's the Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:11:54.812 --> 01:12:06.477]  Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response sometimes seen in abducted hostages, and that's what these pimps literally have these women as slaves, in which the hostage shows signs of loyalty to the hostage taker.
[01:12:07.017 --> 01:12:09.881]  Regardless of the danger or risk in which they have been placed.
[01:12:10.341 --> 01:12:12.504]  The syndrome is named after and it goes into it.
[01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:14.927]  And this is what we see over and over again.
[01:12:14.967 --> 01:12:17.130]  Well, I'm not a mentally ill person.
[01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:19.413]  I'm angry and I'm enraged.
[01:12:19.673 --> 01:12:22.597]  And no more, you criminal scum running the government.
[01:12:22.697 --> 01:12:24.139]  And this is going in globally.
[01:12:24.179 --> 01:12:24.720]  Max, go ahead.
[01:12:25.339 --> 01:12:29.223]  Yeah, well, it's part three of the video on maxgeiger.com.
[01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:30.565]  On the right-hand side, you scroll down.
[01:12:30.865 --> 01:12:34.629]  There's four parts for my recent show, On the Edge.
[01:12:34.789 --> 01:12:37.612]  Starting in part three is the interview with Dr. Levine.
[01:12:38.253 --> 01:12:41.376]  What's the name of that particular video of On the Edge, though, part three?
[01:12:41.396 --> 01:12:45.000]  Yeah, and I brought up the... But videos always have a name, Max.
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:45.801]  What's the name of it?
[01:12:47.065 --> 01:12:51.248]  Well, if you just go, it's on the Edge, on the Edge Bar 3, I think.
[01:12:51.288 --> 01:12:53.289]  It's on my MaxKaiser.com site.
[01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:54.230]  Okay, they found it.
[01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.031]  We're going to play that clip before you leave us.
[01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:56.391]  Go ahead.
[01:12:56.891 --> 01:13:00.834]  Okay, well, it's a 10-minute interview, so I don't know if you have time for that.
[01:13:01.914 --> 01:13:08.879]  I brought up the Stockholm Syndrome as well with Dr. Bruce Levine, and his work goes into something a little bit more comprehensive.
[01:13:08.899 --> 01:13:15.403]  He really gets into it and talks specifically about the policies today that are coming out of the White House.
[01:13:15.843 --> 01:13:23.449]  To foster this abuse syndrome in the population as a way to keep them depressed and to make them malleable.
[01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:35.459]  And this whole body scanning, sexual torture is just part and parcel of this whole model that I've been aware of for a while, which I call the casino gulag model.
[01:13:35.639 --> 01:13:42.525]  And one of the reasons why people allow themselves to be subjected to this type of humiliation
[01:13:44.051 --> 01:13:50.933]  You know, the casino part of the equation is very good at holding out a carrot and making people believe that they're going to win the lotto.
[01:13:50.953 --> 01:13:52.253]  They're going to win the casino job.
[01:13:52.273 --> 01:13:53.794]  They're going to get a job at Goldman Sachs.
[01:13:53.814 --> 01:13:58.875]  They're going to become a huge beneficiary somehow of all of the insider trading and market manipulation.
[01:13:59.095 --> 01:14:01.976]  And that's the hope that people think in the back of their mind.
[01:14:01.996 --> 01:14:03.416]  They're willing to put up with anything.
[01:14:03.616 --> 01:14:09.098]  They're willing to put up with strip searches at the airport if they think that by some chance they're going to have the winning lotto ticket.
[01:14:09.398 --> 01:14:12.919]  And that's what the media, particularly outlets like CNBC,
[01:14:13.519 --> 01:14:17.480]  Which has the ticker tape running 24-7, and Jim Cramer, he's pounding the table.
[01:14:17.761 --> 01:14:18.641]  You can be a winner!
[01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.702]  You can make a fortune in this stock!
[01:14:21.002 --> 01:14:24.283]  But all he's doing is he's unloading stocks that institutions don't own.
[01:14:24.303 --> 01:14:30.965]  He's laundering stocks for the banks, which are laundering all of their TARP money vis-a-vis Jim Cramer on CNBC.
[01:14:31.265 --> 01:14:38.668]  And it's just like going into any casino, which is surrounded by slot machines where the odds of winning are definitely against you, and hookers.
[01:14:39.028 --> 01:14:46.070]  Well, I think that there's, I'll put something on the table here for you to consider, which is that the country that was the first into the meat grinder of this huge, globalized, syndicated fraud, it was Iceland.
[01:15:09.111 --> 01:15:12.533]  And Iceland, the Icelandic population, the bankers on Wall Street.
[01:15:12.573 --> 01:15:15.796]  Now I was in Iceland, as you know I made a film about this.
[01:15:16.176 --> 01:15:25.362]  I was in Iceland and a year before it collapsed, it's a film on YouTube called Money Geyser, I sat down with bankers in Iceland and I said, your krona and your economy is about to collapse.
[01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:27.043]  They said, no, no it's not.
[01:15:27.664 --> 01:15:37.030]  That night I was in a sushi restaurant in a hotel, Hotel 101 in Reykjavik, and there were these Lehman Brothers brokers
[01:15:37.589 --> 01:15:40.453]  And of course, I worked on Wall Street for many years, so I struck up a conversation.
[01:15:40.773 --> 01:15:45.800]  And they were telling me that they were plotting to crash the corona to make a huge score.
[01:15:46.461 --> 01:15:50.566]  And I said, yeah, but the banker here just told me that, you know, this economy is in great shape.
[01:15:50.626 --> 01:15:51.588]  You know, it sounds risky.
[01:15:51.628 --> 01:15:53.150]  They're like, no, no, no, you don't understand.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.881]  They've leveraged themselves 10 to 1.
[01:15:55.921 --> 01:15:57.922]  The entire GDP has been leveraged 10 to 1.
[01:15:58.142 --> 01:16:02.043]  And we've got this global syndicate of short sellers and all of our regular crew.
[01:16:02.263 --> 01:16:06.125]  And we're going to take this economy down and we're going to score huge.
[01:16:06.525 --> 01:16:07.885]  And that's exactly what they did.
[01:16:08.066 --> 01:16:13.468]  And Goldman Sachs pilots the entire banking system and policy and has their people at all levels of government.
[01:16:13.868 --> 01:16:17.549]  Instead of them being arrested and the nightmare ending, it isn't going to end.
[01:16:17.609 --> 01:16:19.110]  It's going to get more and more hellish.
[01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:23.533]  And Jack Bauer tortures people to get answers, and tortures children.
[01:16:23.974 --> 01:16:25.975]  Everybody fantasizes to be a torturer.
[01:16:26.295 --> 01:16:33.982]  Now they all get to be tortured, or you go get a job as a humiliator and an abuser, and it just gets sicker and sicker and sicker.
[01:16:35.723 --> 01:16:46.793]  Well, now in Iceland, they are voting on whether or not to reimburse the UK government for millions of dollars that were
[01:16:47.941 --> 01:16:59.784]  Guaranteed by the bankers on UK savers, five and a half billion dollars of savings that were used to fuel the speculative run-up in Reykjavik.
[01:17:00.364 --> 01:17:12.647]  And now the UK government classified Iceland as a terrorist for not paying back, for not allowing the citizens to be forced to pay back the speculative money that was lost by the bankers.
[01:17:13.419 --> 01:17:20.709]  And now they want the citizens to fork over billions of dollars for restitution to the bankers and the speculators.
[01:17:21.149 --> 01:17:27.758]  And if they don't do that, they're threatening all kinds of draconian measures and destitution in Iceland.
[01:17:28.179 --> 01:17:30.562]  And the people have been out there rioting in the streets.
[01:17:31.218 --> 01:17:36.061]  Because they're being forced to riot in the streets because the bankers are putting them out of their homes.
[01:17:36.081 --> 01:17:36.842]  Let me stop you.
[01:17:36.882 --> 01:17:37.582]  This is so key.
[01:17:37.602 --> 01:17:45.927]  They've been rioting for more than 10 months, taking over government buildings, a very highly educated, low crime rate, some of the most professional people in the world.
[01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:48.949]  They have been rioting for coming up on a year.
[01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:54.033]  And I remember seeing that at least eight months ago on the London Guardian like it was normal.
[01:17:54.773 --> 01:18:06.222]  That Brown used anti-terror legislation to seize the bank accounts of Icelanders that had their money in British banks inside Iceland and without.
[01:18:06.342 --> 01:18:17.711]  So, for those that want to know, just like the homeland security documents that we got that we leaked last year say the real threat to homeland security is conservatives, libertarians, anti-war people, gun owners, veterans.
[01:18:18.232 --> 01:18:21.474]  This whole thing is to rob your bank account!
[01:18:21.554 --> 01:18:22.155]  Max Keiser.
[01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:46.260]  Well, on that front, there was a great piece in ZeroEdge.com website about a little legislation that was just sneaked in a couple of weeks ago, which now makes it possible for the banks to declare that they are not going to honor money market funds, that they can seize money market funds at any time for any reason.
[01:18:47.321 --> 01:18:51.263]  Which means, so anyone who's got money in a money market fund in any of the banks
[01:18:52.390 --> 01:19:05.056]  And that's just the standard savings account for most people.
[01:19:05.396 --> 01:19:10.958]  I mean, the little bit of money I've got in the bank, because I don't trust the banks, but to run the business, it's in money markets.
[01:19:11.018 --> 01:19:13.039]  Well, you just dropped a bomb on me, Max.
[01:19:13.079 --> 01:19:14.040]  What's the headline on that?
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:14.680]  I want to look it up.
[01:19:15.754 --> 01:19:25.421]  It's on zeroedge.com is the site, and it's, um, let's see, if you just put money market seizure, money market seizing, it should pop up.
[01:19:25.441 --> 01:19:25.801]  Unbelievable.
[01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:29.944]  I mean, it just gets, Max, it's clear, they're getting ready to really drop the hammer, aren't they?
[01:19:31.805 --> 01:19:34.367]  Well, again, it's just, you have to understand the model.
[01:19:34.427 --> 01:19:41.672]  The business model, you know, I'm primarily a stockbroker and a businessman, you know, I look at this from the money side of the equation.
[01:19:42.464 --> 01:19:58.243]  And you just have to understand, you know, for example, from the money side of the equation, going back to when they declared the so-called War on Terror, at the exact same time, John Poindexter, who was Assistant Treasury to the Defense Department... Tell us about that when we come back.
[01:19:58.764 --> 01:19:58.964]  Alright.
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:03.281]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:20:03.641 --> 01:20:05.482]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:20:05.922 --> 01:20:06.362]  Don't!
[01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:09.823]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:20:10.244 --> 01:20:17.366]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[01:20:19.327 --> 01:20:22.988]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[01:20:26.150 --> 01:20:33.576]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:34.897]  Herb K was right.
[01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:38.139]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:20:38.279 --> 01:20:39.300]  What have you got to lose?
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.783]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:20:43.323 --> 01:20:46.425]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[01:20:46.665 --> 01:20:47.025]  Call 888-352-7726.

[01:20:47.785 --> 01:20:47.825]  888-352-7726.
[01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:51.107]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:20:51.727 --> 01:20:53.868]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:20:53.888 --> 01:20:56.149]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:10.655 --> 01:21:13.336]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:13.356 --> 01:21:19.558]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:19.718 --> 01:21:24.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:34.903]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:37.125]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:37.365 --> 01:21:38.686]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:38.946 --> 01:21:41.228]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:41.408 --> 01:21:43.249]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:43.269 --> 01:21:48.353]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:48.693 --> 01:21:57.800]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:59.645 --> 01:22:05.526]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[01:22:05.967 --> 01:22:10.628]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[01:22:10.908 --> 01:22:14.709]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[01:22:14.989 --> 01:22:16.149]  Let's put this another way.
[01:22:16.329 --> 01:22:21.510]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:24.311]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[01:22:24.591 --> 01:22:26.951]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[01:22:27.232 --> 01:22:28.612]  You can possess it in your hand.
[01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:29.912]  Take it with you.
[01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:31.292]  Gold is real money.
[01:22:31.692 --> 01:22:32.793]  Gold is honest money.
[01:22:33.053 --> 01:22:35.293]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.

[01:24:12.468 --> 01:24:17.632]  Our country is descending into the most horrible sci-fi tyranny you can imagine.
[01:24:17.672 --> 01:24:26.799]  The planet is falling to the terrorists that stage the terror attacks and then fund themselves off of all the security measures they put in.
[01:24:40.839 --> 01:24:42.480]  Max Keiser calls coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.042]  We're going to look at the economy and what's happening there.
[01:24:45.102 --> 01:24:49.906]  But continuing, we're bringing up Poindexter wanting to create, this was in the Washington Post.
[01:24:50.787 --> 01:24:52.108]  He, in fact, they tried to launch it.
[01:24:52.848 --> 01:24:54.610]  Well, for those that don't know, tell people about it.
[01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:57.252]  Literally making terrorism part of the economy.
[01:24:57.272 --> 01:25:02.556]  And then I have another question that dovetails with that, because we know about the insider trading on American and United before 9-11.
[01:25:04.017 --> 01:25:09.621]  Did you look at the stocks, I haven't done this, of the body scanner companies in the days before Christmas?
[01:25:09.961 --> 01:25:14.304]  Let me guess, I bet some bets were made that the stock was going to go way up.
[01:25:15.905 --> 01:25:18.066]  I haven't looked at the numbers on that.
[01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:21.628]  Let's get back to John Poindexter for a second.
[01:25:21.648 --> 01:25:28.813]  John Poindexter was higher up in the Department of Justice in the military in the U.S.
[01:25:29.093 --> 01:25:32.215]  and during the launch of the War on Terror
[01:25:33.107 --> 01:25:46.832]  He launched the so-called Policy Analysis Market, or PAM, which was going to be an online virtual exchange where people can speculate on the next terror attack.
[01:25:47.612 --> 01:25:53.634]  And John Poindexter was saying, well, you know, the point of this is to use the markets, which are efficient.
[01:25:53.654 --> 01:25:55.975]  You know, the sole mantra that markets are efficient.
[01:25:57.004 --> 01:25:57.904]  I don't think so.
[01:26:17.791 --> 01:26:26.879]  Yes, if we only turn terror into an online tradable market, then we would know in advance where the next strike is going to be, and we would prepare accordingly.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:34.927]  But of course, all it does is it gives yet the insiders another way to profit on the terror that they themselves are stoking.
[01:26:34.947 --> 01:26:42.534]  As Ron Paul has said recently, they are terrorists because we're occupiers, end quote.
[01:26:43.619 --> 01:26:54.108]  And so if you're an occupying force and you're causing terror, and you're already making billions, well why not add another layer on top of this called the policy analysis market?
[01:26:54.148 --> 01:27:00.694]  Sell to the public as if you're going to help figure out the next attack, but all it is is you're just making more money on the attacks that you're already creating.
[01:27:00.914 --> 01:27:08.961]  Because they always, it comes out, know beforehand and let real attacks take place, but more often than not, they're staging the attack to begin with.
[01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:11.429]  Absolutely.
[01:27:11.449 --> 01:27:18.992]  I mean, it's about making money much faster than waiting around and clipping coupons.
[01:27:19.032 --> 01:27:20.993]  They're 5% or 6% on your money.
[01:27:21.013 --> 01:27:24.954]  If you had a chance to make 100% in five weeks, then you'd go ahead and do it.
[01:27:25.456 --> 01:27:29.279]  And that's what's behind all the policies.
[01:27:29.319 --> 01:27:32.021]  All the policies in Washington are created by speculators.
[01:27:32.382 --> 01:27:35.404]  The energy policies are created by the oil speculators.
[01:27:35.444 --> 01:27:39.387]  The health policies are created by the health and insurance industry, which are speculators.
[01:27:39.407 --> 01:27:43.891]  They're all basically speculating on the global markets one way or another.
[01:27:44.171 --> 01:27:48.074]  The banking industry, certainly all the policies there are created by the banking industry.
[01:27:48.314 --> 01:27:49.155]  It's like Enron.
[01:27:49.195 --> 01:27:51.877]  Remember Enron created the energy policies under Bush?
[01:27:51.897 --> 01:27:52.998]  That's continued.
[01:27:53.318 --> 01:27:54.379]  All these speculators
[01:27:54.799 --> 01:27:58.801]  Write the policies in Washington in ways that make it easier for them to speculate.
[01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:05.205]  They've access to cheap money at the Federal Reserve at near zero percent interest rate, and there's no regulatory framework.
[01:28:05.225 --> 01:28:06.225]  There's no Glass-Steagall.
[01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:07.286]  There's nothing holding them back.
[01:28:07.546 --> 01:28:09.587]  They can make all the crazy bets they want.
[01:28:09.807 --> 01:28:14.530]  They can invade countries that they know are going to cost certain stocks and commodities to go in certain ways.
[01:28:14.770 --> 01:28:15.591]  Bank the profits.
[01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:16.391]  Book the profits.
[01:28:16.531 --> 01:28:21.634]  Oh, and whenever they make a mistake, they claim, oh, it's terrorist, and we need to go to the taxpayer to bail us out.
[01:28:21.934 --> 01:28:24.335]  So it's heads we win, tails everybody else loses.
[01:28:24.355 --> 01:28:28.556]  They've been doing it now for years, and that's why the wealth and income gap in America is so huge.
[01:28:28.616 --> 01:28:29.396]  It's never been higher.
[01:28:29.477 --> 01:28:34.418]  Even during the robber baron period in American history, it never had a wealth and income gap as high as it is now.
[01:28:34.658 --> 01:28:36.439]  It's never been as high as it is right now.
[01:28:36.659 --> 01:28:43.081]  This is exactly the situation that existed pre-American War for Independence.
[01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:49.103]  America didn't want to be under the thumb of an aristocratic occupying royalty.
[01:28:50.007 --> 01:28:52.650]  But this is exactly the situation today.
[01:28:52.951 --> 01:29:00.940]  The bankers are an occupying force of aristocrats that are simply engaging in this casino gulag model where it's heads they win, tails they lose.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:07.928]  And to keep us stupid and in line, they bring in these airport scanners, which are humiliating.
[01:29:08.502 --> 01:29:09.522]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:29:09.542 --> 01:29:17.785]  We're going to get into his outlook for 2010 and the economy as things are consolidated and vertically integrated through the Homeland Security global dictatorship.
[01:29:17.805 --> 01:29:18.485]  It's planetary.
[01:29:35.762 --> 01:29:38.544]  We are also going to open the phones up and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:38.584 --> 01:29:42.166]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:42.206 --> 01:29:47.528]  Our websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and JonesReport.com.
[01:29:47.568 --> 01:29:48.009]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.710 --> 01:29:51.611]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.111 --> 01:29:53.712]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.632 --> 01:29:57.354]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.965 --> 01:30:04.607]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:04.967 --> 01:30:07.989]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:12.991]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:13.011 --> 01:30:19.255]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:21.656]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:22.176 --> 01:30:23.597]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:30:23.657 --> 01:30:24.938]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:27.200]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:41.092 --> 01:30:42.914]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:30:42.934 --> 01:30:48.021]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:48.382 --> 01:30:57.493]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:00.199 --> 01:31:02.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.221 --> 01:31:08.183]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:08.543 --> 01:31:10.284]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:10.604 --> 01:31:15.407]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:15.587 --> 01:31:16.567]  How much do you want?
[01:31:16.787 --> 01:31:17.528]  When do you want it?
[01:31:17.908 --> 01:31:19.509]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:19.789 --> 01:31:20.609]  When will you need it?
[01:31:20.869 --> 01:31:22.930]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.071 --> 01:31:24.171]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:24.411 --> 01:31:25.712]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.032 --> 01:31:28.313]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:31:28.453 --> 01:31:30.995]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.175 --> 01:31:34.376]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:34.776 --> 01:31:38.278]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:38.578 --> 01:31:39.579]  How much will you need?
[01:31:39.819 --> 01:31:40.419]  We don't know.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.640]  How much do you want?
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.560]  All you can get.
[01:31:42.761 --> 01:31:43.441]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:43.841 --> 01:31:44.061]  I think.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.501]  What's your home worth?
[01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.604]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:32:02.784 --> 01:32:05.528]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:32:05.828 --> 01:32:13.357]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:32:13.558 --> 01:32:17.002]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[01:33:17.812 --> 01:33:25.498]  All right, I'm going to play a clip from Max Keiser's television show, but I want to set this up first, because Max makes a good point.
[01:33:26.159 --> 01:33:40.591]  You know, shows like Alex Jones, they're telling you the problem, but what Dr. Levine is saying on his show is that with the Stockholm Syndrome, with this abused person syndrome, that if we don't then have solutions, it makes people depressed.
[01:33:40.611 --> 01:33:42.392]  Well, we are coming forward with the solutions.
[01:33:42.412 --> 01:33:42.893]  We're saying
[01:33:43.991 --> 01:33:55.335]  We are talking to listeners the next few days, developing the boycott strategy, just like we exposed Copenhagen as a fraud, the swine flu as a fraud, the banker bailout as a fraud, to empower people.
[01:33:55.855 --> 01:34:03.498]  Because if the mainstream media is just saying, we're going to body scan you, which 90 plus percent of Americans are against in polls, some polls are 80, the point is most people are against it.
[01:34:04.078 --> 01:34:07.239]  They just put it out like it's a foregone conclusion, that makes people depressed.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:07.920]  I'm here
[01:34:09.261 --> 01:34:13.882]  Showing people we can win, showing people we can take action, but that people need to be upset.
[01:34:14.242 --> 01:34:28.985]  They need to be, instead of depressed, angry, and get out of their comfort zones, and get angry enough to stand there with a sandwich board about how we're in a police state, or to call in to talk radio, or set up a website, or go to city council, or call their congressman, or dump their stock in these body scanning companies.
[01:34:29.025 --> 01:34:34.926]  I bet a lot of you own stock in these through 401ks and mutual funds that don't even know it.
[01:34:35.726 --> 01:34:38.448]  That we're not going to put up with these body scanners.
[01:34:38.488 --> 01:34:39.389]  That we're going to say no.
[01:34:39.449 --> 01:34:44.433]  That we know their strategy of incrementally rolling them out so we understand the conditioning.
[01:34:44.453 --> 01:34:45.494]  We need to say no now.
[01:34:46.135 --> 01:34:46.495]  Okay?
[01:34:46.555 --> 01:34:49.237]  But Max, make your point about this.
[01:34:50.338 --> 01:34:50.578]  Right.
[01:34:51.199 --> 01:34:52.159]  It's an excellent interview.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.380]  He makes some great points.
[01:34:54.081 --> 01:34:58.665]  And it's a great stepping off place for discussion.
[01:34:58.745 --> 01:35:02.408]  And let me just add one quick comment to what you're saying.
[01:35:02.708 --> 01:35:05.070]  You know, this whole idea of boycotts that you've mentioned.
[01:35:05.598 --> 01:35:14.701]  You know, I have always believed that the best way to fight the speculators and the rogue capitalists is to come up with a way to beat them at their own game.
[01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:25.604]  And in the area of boycotts, if you look at all those companies out there, there's actually a way to figure out which one is the most vulnerable to a boycott and then take that approach.
[01:35:25.824 --> 01:35:32.166]  In other words, instead of trying to finesse it, you take the approach of, you want to win.
[01:35:32.608 --> 01:35:32.928]  I think so.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:50.222]  Well, here's the issue, and I'm not saying that isn't a good plan, but we need multifaceted plans.
[01:35:50.242 --> 01:35:53.424]  A lot of people don't have the money to go try to short these people.
[01:35:54.204 --> 01:35:58.846]  Or, the system has the tens of trillions that the central banks give them.
[01:35:59.206 --> 01:36:01.167]  That's how they're able to leverage and manipulate.
[01:36:01.247 --> 01:36:02.287]  Though, look at gold.
[01:36:02.668 --> 01:36:05.829]  They've been trying to suppress it, but they've been largely unsuccessful.
[01:36:06.529 --> 01:36:12.395]  So I think a general knowledge, a general understanding of this, that things are going to get worse if we don't stand up.
[01:36:12.455 --> 01:36:15.097]  I mean, I don't think it's... Hold on just a second, Max.
[01:36:15.117 --> 01:36:16.438]  Max, let me finish my statement here.
[01:36:16.458 --> 01:36:17.179]  This is important.
[01:36:17.739 --> 01:36:27.008]  There is a certain percentage of the population, 25-30% from what I've researched on the Stockholm Syndrome and other similar syndromes, that when they're being abused, they roll over.
[01:36:27.873 --> 01:36:27.953]  And
[01:36:43.974 --> 01:36:59.118]  Loving the flames, saying, I'll hug the flames, I'll love it, that will make the fire go away, or, oh, I'm gonna roast weenies, it's okay, because they decide to play the mental trick of Crimestop that Orwell talked about, and they decide to just submit to it, and to just go along with it.
[01:36:59.338 --> 01:37:01.719]  That's their fault if 25-30% do that.
[01:37:01.979 --> 01:37:06.700]  I'm not looking for the cowardly jellyfish that hear this and just go, aw, shucks, I'm gonna accept it.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.502]  I'm here telling people we have a duty to our children to say no to this, Max!
[01:37:12.282 --> 01:37:12.462]  Okay.
[01:37:13.294 --> 01:37:20.978]  The problem, as I see it, with a multiple front attack is that you needlessly dilute
[01:37:21.539 --> 01:37:23.040]  Your impact.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.603]  Well, Max, I don't think that's a bad idea.
[01:37:57.623 --> 01:37:58.923]  I think it's great.
[01:37:58.943 --> 01:38:14.953]  I think educating people about the types of stocks and bonds they own and to really morally do research and not immorally invest in biometrics and body scanners and police state implements and to invest in organic food, true local sustainability,
[01:38:15.373 --> 01:38:18.014]  You know, that the system creates fake counterfeits for.
[01:38:18.394 --> 01:38:37.618]  I think that as a process is good, but the system has said they're not going to let their four or five big powerhouses go down too big to fail, but we'll hear your one-inch punch idea or solution after we play this video clip with the doctor you were interviewing about this victimhood psychology.
[01:38:37.838 --> 01:38:38.779]  Here it is, we'll be right back.
[01:38:40.743 --> 01:38:48.507]  Alright, now Dr. Levine, your latest article for Alternet.org is titled, Are Americans a Broken People?
[01:38:49.868 --> 01:38:53.790]  Why We've Stopped Fighting Back Against the Forces of Oppression.
[01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:56.651]  Now, explain this a little bit.
[01:38:56.711 --> 01:39:06.336]  Why are, in this piece, explain what it means to be a broken people, and can you go through the signs of a broken people, and what would a nation of broken people look like?
[01:39:07.352 --> 01:39:13.178]  I think one sign would be that when people actually know a lot of the truths about how they're being oppressed.
[01:39:13.238 --> 01:39:14.880]  So, for example, when you have
[01:39:15.532 --> 01:39:28.440]  You know, a society, an American society that, it's not the majority, depending on what polls you're looking at, but certainly a significant, many millions, and probably a majority, who don't understand why the heck we're even in these wars that we're in.
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:38.506]  A majority of people who want a much more humane health coverage system, if not single-payer, at least some healthy public option.
[01:39:38.706 --> 01:39:44.430]  I mean, you have huge numbers of people out there who know the truth, how they're being oppressed, victimized.
[01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:45.571]  I don't know.
[01:40:01.408 --> 01:40:04.849]  But they can't, they feel helpless and hopeless to do something about that.
[01:40:05.129 --> 01:40:27.314]  So I think, you know, the hallmark sign of when you're seeing somebody in whatever you would want to call it, we don't need to use psychology jargon, you could call it, you could just call it a beaten, broken people, we don't want to call it abuse syndrome, you can call it whatever the heck you want, but there's a certain kind of thing that happens when people are completely dispirited that, you know, that more truths about how they're getting oppressed really are not going to free them up.
[01:40:27.682 --> 01:40:32.989]  Okay, so abuse syndrome is, uh, I mean it sounds a little bit like Stockholm Syndrome, if you will.
[01:40:33.209 --> 01:40:42.602]  You know, famously, uh, a situation where the captor falls in love with the person who's keeping them hostage, uh, Patty, uh, what's her name, Patty Hearst, being a famous
[01:40:42.622 --> 01:40:44.023]  Well, let me give you a famous example of this.
[01:40:44.043 --> 01:41:02.670]  So you're saying the entire country of the United States is suffering from abuse syndrome, and that the people in charge, like Obama and the rest of his crew, are like the abusive pimps, or the abusive spouse, who are just beating the poor victim, who then becomes completely demoralized, and there's a self-feeding phenomenon.
[01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:05.391]  And there's an aspect to this which is very, very interesting.
[01:41:05.411 --> 01:41:11.434]  You say in a recent piece here, can people become so broken that the truths of how they are being screwed
[01:41:12.034 --> 01:41:16.578]  Do not, quote, set them free, but instead further demoralize them.
[01:41:16.618 --> 01:41:27.528]  And the reason I bring this up is that in the U.S., there are media outlets, let's say Alex Jones, who does a job in exposing how Americans are getting screwed.
[01:41:27.588 --> 01:41:29.430]  He does, on his side, brilliantly.
[01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:35.275]  But according to the abuse syndrome, you're saying that this is actually making the situation worse because every time
[01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:41.941]  More abuse is exposed and nothing happens, it causes further demoralization as part of a feedback loop.
[01:41:41.961 --> 01:41:42.782]  Am I getting this correct?
[01:41:43.444 --> 01:41:44.565]  Yeah, I mean, a couple of things there.
[01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:49.369]  One is just like, you know, the Stockholm Syndrome that you mentioned is, I don't think that's happening for all Americans.
[01:41:49.429 --> 01:41:52.992]  I mean, in that syndrome, people actually fall in love with their abusers.
[01:41:53.292 --> 01:42:04.461]  I don't think, you know, that there's a lot of people on the left who have fallen in love with Dick Cheney and George W. Bush, although, you know, some... No, no, no, sorry to interrupt, but I mean, Obama has a cult-worshipping crowd.
[01:42:04.501 --> 01:42:05.602]  They are in love with Obama.
[01:42:05.622 --> 01:42:06.302]  He can do no wrong.
[01:42:06.343 --> 01:42:07.343]  It's like the Daily Kos.
[01:42:07.363 --> 01:42:07.684]  Right, right.
[01:42:07.884 --> 01:42:09.845]  The Daily Kos, he can't do any wrong.
[01:42:10.045 --> 01:42:12.788]  But you're saying that they could be victims of abuse syndrome.
[01:42:13.482 --> 01:42:27.316]  Right, I mean, I think the hallmark of it is that if, you know, somebody is, you know, giving, you know, one of the classic things of somebody who's an abusive pimp or an abusive spouse is that they don't always, you know, beat the heck out of somebody.
[01:42:27.356 --> 01:42:34.843]  Sometimes they bring you flowers, you know, but at bottom, if you're being, not who you are is not being taken seriously,
[01:42:35.103 --> 01:42:35.443]  We're good.
[01:42:59.958 --> 01:43:15.958]  Anything going on in our government here in the last 30 years is that people are in that kind of a syndrome where they're really getting nothing for their taxes here except these militaries that are fighting wars all over the world that many, many Americans don't even understand why they're doing it.
[01:43:16.218 --> 01:43:27.668]  Okay, you say bringing flowers can be a form of abuse, but to be more specific, I think this plays into your thought about the medicalization of the abuse syndrome.
[01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:30.650]  So instead of getting flowers, people are getting meds.
[01:43:30.891 --> 01:43:32.112]  Can you speak about this a little bit?
[01:43:32.952 --> 01:43:47.705]  Yeah, I mean I think my industry, I'm in the mental health profession here in the U.S., I'm a psychologist and I spent a good part of that article confronting what my business, which is not so much a professional business these days, and what they've done to contribute.
[01:43:47.745 --> 01:43:50.948]  And I think they've contributed to the abuse syndrome in many ways.
[01:43:50.988 --> 01:43:57.334]  They've taken a lot of our most potentially rebellious and non-compliant young people out there
[01:43:57.694 --> 01:43:57.854]  How odd!
[01:44:12.591 --> 01:44:14.292]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not being facetious here.
[01:44:14.312 --> 01:44:15.592]  I'm not joking about that.
[01:44:15.672 --> 01:44:16.452]  That's going on.
[01:44:16.672 --> 01:44:21.174]  And they're increasingly subject to Medicaid drugs and behavior modifications.
[01:44:21.394 --> 01:44:29.617]  But there's even a larger group of, I think, folks who are being described as mentally ill who are engaged in what I would call more of a passive rebellion.
[01:44:29.897 --> 01:44:35.759]  So there's millions of kids out there who are bored in boring schools who just don't pay attention because it's not interesting for them.
[01:44:35.779 --> 01:44:36.979]  They're not getting anything out of it.
[01:44:37.119 --> 01:44:37.259]  Okay.
[01:44:56.311 --> 01:44:59.212]  That's the first part of the clip, the second part's up on MaxKaiser.com.
[01:44:59.992 --> 01:45:08.975]  Max, my issue is, I'm going after, as the doctor, I hadn't even seen the clip, I just wanted to play it, as he said that everybody isn't under this.
[01:45:09.195 --> 01:45:17.998]  I'm after the people who didn't know, or who were slowly brought into denial, who never really paid attention to the world, that kind of just accept what's put in front of them.
[01:45:18.498 --> 01:45:23.360]  I'm trying to wake them up, or get them to see what's happening, and all we talk about here
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:24.000]  Yes.
[01:45:42.302 --> 01:45:45.603]  And so they just get deeper into submitting to their pimp.
[01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:52.124]  And when he talks about giving them flowers, that's like John Gotti, the Teflon Don, a couple times a year would buy pizzas for the whole neighborhood.
[01:45:52.384 --> 01:45:53.465]  Fireworks displays.
[01:45:54.125 --> 01:45:55.845]  He would pay for a funeral for somebody.
[01:45:56.245 --> 01:46:05.007]  Just like the government puts all these billboards up and TV ads and radio ads of how they're helping us, and they're our daddy, and they're the authority, and they're going to keep us safe.
[01:46:05.367 --> 01:46:07.208]  That is the carrot of the stick.
[01:46:07.488 --> 01:46:08.068]  Max Keiser.
[01:46:09.042 --> 01:46:19.255]  Well, the doctor is saying that at some point in the cycle, the truth, the truth, the people recognize what is the truth is making them feel even sicker.
[01:46:19.275 --> 01:46:21.378]  So we don't tell them the truth?
[01:46:22.239 --> 01:46:22.620]  Excuse me?
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.202]  So we don't tell people what's happening?
[01:46:25.605 --> 01:46:37.178]  Well, that's the paradox, and that's... No, they want to make you depressed and go that direction so you are broke back, broken as he said, and just submit to it.
[01:46:37.458 --> 01:46:39.481]  I'm saying end the mind control.
[01:46:39.901 --> 01:46:45.548]  End the literal hoax we're under, the spell, the trance we're in.
[01:46:46.687 --> 01:46:47.849]  Well, I mean, let's think of it.
[01:46:47.909 --> 01:46:54.257]  In your case, for example, your film, The Obama Deception, I was one of those people that was reluctant to accept it.
[01:46:54.357 --> 01:46:55.118]  Then I saw it.
[01:46:55.479 --> 01:46:57.221]  At some point, I saw it as the truth.
[01:46:58.178 --> 01:46:59.679]  I made that transition.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:06.264]  And in your shows, you're now at a point now where it's no longer so-called conspiracy theories.
[01:47:06.544 --> 01:47:14.870]  A lot of what you're talking, the majority of what you're talking about now, which was dismissed even a year or two ago as conspiracy theory, is now becoming the truth.
[01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:16.931]  This is not a conspiracy theory anymore.
[01:47:16.971 --> 01:47:17.352]  We're winning!
[01:47:17.452 --> 01:47:18.032]  We're winning!
[01:47:19.073 --> 01:47:20.954]  Well, it's being recognized as the truth.
[01:47:21.054 --> 01:47:21.414]  Okay.
[01:47:21.535 --> 01:47:24.797]  So that brings us up to the present, which is, now what is the action?
[01:47:27.421 --> 01:47:28.702]  We beat Copenhagen.
[01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:29.163]  Hold on.
[01:47:29.663 --> 01:47:30.764]  We exposed the flu.
[01:47:30.824 --> 01:47:32.026]  Most people don't take the shot.
[01:47:32.426 --> 01:47:33.207]  It's a huge fraud.
[01:47:33.247 --> 01:47:33.867]  Most people know.
[01:47:33.887 --> 01:47:34.968]  We exposed Copenhagen.
[01:47:35.329 --> 01:47:37.591]  We exposed... We're winning.
[01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:39.193]  I mean, the strategy is working.
[01:47:39.833 --> 01:47:41.415]  Well, the truth is being revealed.
[01:47:41.875 --> 01:47:49.022]  And now the question is, as far as action goes, you're saying that a multi-faceted attack is what you're thinking about?
[01:47:49.342 --> 01:47:51.765]  Because we're being hit by a multi-faceted attack.
[01:47:52.375 --> 01:48:01.321]  Okay, and my thought is that I fall into this category, let's call it a one-inch punch, or a single thrust, and that's my thought.
[01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:04.403]  Tell us, tell us what the one-inch punch is.
[01:48:05.223 --> 01:48:09.646]  Well, the one-inch punch, in other words, you want to drop somebody with one punch.
[01:48:09.906 --> 01:48:12.087]  You don't want to be getting into a fight with that.
[01:48:12.107 --> 01:48:14.149]  Yeah, you want to tear their nose off with the first punch.
[01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:15.350]  So what is the one-inch punch?
[01:48:16.090 --> 01:48:19.232]  Okay, well after looking at every single company in the United States,
[01:48:20.155 --> 01:48:36.370]  And if you think about boycotts as the cheap way to engage activism, the only company that is the most vulnerable to a mass boycott, which would cause the one-inch punch effect and destroy that company within a matter of three months, is Coca-Cola.
[01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:41.833]  Now, you may tell me that, well, I've got no beef with Coca-Cola, and I've got no problem with Coca-Cola.
[01:48:41.873 --> 01:48:51.401]  But I state to you that the activist community, or the community of listeners to your show and my show... They would learn that victory, then they could do it to others.
[01:48:51.521 --> 01:48:53.082]  I say go after the airlines, but go ahead.
[01:48:53.749 --> 01:48:57.991]  Well, the problem with the airlines is that they're not vulnerable to a boycott.
[01:48:58.092 --> 01:49:02.074]  I did a study and I looked at every single company on the stock exchange and I looked at it from two ways.
[01:49:02.314 --> 01:49:07.717]  Vulnerability to a boycott, which I determined as the stock price over the sales.
[01:49:08.097 --> 01:49:14.101]  So for every dollar of sales that you withhold from the company, it would have the biggest impact on the price of the stock.
[01:49:14.488 --> 01:49:18.674]  The airlines do not have a huge vulnerability to- Really?
[01:49:18.694 --> 01:49:23.060]  They've already lost a lot of money from people not engaged in terrorism because of all the garbage.
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:25.163]  But I mean, okay, you're the expert on this, I'll believe you.
[01:49:25.423 --> 01:49:27.206]  So you go after Coca-Cola, how do you go after them?
[01:49:28.123 --> 01:49:52.545]  Well, instead of spreading your bet and saying, I'm going to be a part of this group and that group and this boycott and that boycott, every single person who is feeling like the abuse syndrome is kicking them right now and they're being treated like chattel in the banker's meat grinder of speculation, if everything in that includes probably 100 million Americans or more, I would think, anybody who's trying to work for a living,
[01:49:53.257 --> 01:50:00.868]  Uh, if you simply do not drink Coca-Cola for three to six to nine months, and you see, and you take the stock price down to zero, and that's key.
[01:50:01.369 --> 01:50:05.354]  You know if you're winning because every single day the Wall Street Journal publishes the stock price.
[01:50:05.695 --> 01:50:07.818]  If the stock price is going down, you're winning.
[01:50:08.317 --> 01:50:11.418]  And the goal is to simply take the price of the stock to zero.
[01:50:11.678 --> 01:50:14.278]  Now, of course, people will say, well, what about all the people who work at that company?
[01:50:14.298 --> 01:50:15.138]  They're going to lose their job.
[01:50:15.158 --> 01:50:15.999]  I have news for you.
[01:50:16.019 --> 01:50:17.359]  They're going to lose your job anyway.
[01:50:17.379 --> 01:50:20.019]  Or you're going to be different to me out of existence anyway.
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:23.600]  It's beyond trying to finesse the situation now.
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:28.681]  We have to show them that we can drop them to the mat with a single punch.
[01:50:29.041 --> 01:50:30.302]  Coke is the most vulnerable.
[01:50:30.382 --> 01:50:31.902]  It's the most vulnerable to a boycott.
[01:50:32.402 --> 01:50:45.365]  And I've done the study on this, and this is the company that is the one... Well, you've got to have a reason to boycott them on the surface, and that would be putting aspartame, the feces of bacteria, in the Coke.
[01:50:45.445 --> 01:50:47.426]  And for those who don't know, that's how they make aspartame.
[01:50:47.726 --> 01:50:50.407]  They feed toxic waste to genetically engineered E. coli.
[01:50:51.127 --> 01:50:56.248]  They feed toxic waste to genetically engineered E. coli, and they put it in your drinks and food, and it brain damages you.
[01:50:56.548 --> 01:50:58.869]  All right, Max, we'll come back and take calls and get into other issues.

[01:52:08.638 --> 01:52:10.059]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:13.401]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:13.421 --> 01:52:19.642]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.822 --> 01:52:24.843]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:25.004 --> 01:52:34.986]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:35.106 --> 01:52:37.207]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:37.448 --> 01:52:38.789]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:39.049 --> 01:52:41.330]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:43.332]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:43.352 --> 01:52:48.435]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:54:09.697 --> 01:54:18.006]  Then I'm going to spend the rest of the show opening the phones up and going over the full overview of the naked body scanners and what this really means.
[01:54:19.367 --> 01:54:24.032]  Before I go back to Max Keiser, I want to thank a few of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[01:54:25.077 --> 01:54:35.260]  One of them is fighting Big Brother with Big Brother, and that's the Diginet.net group of camera sunglasses, camera pens, very inexpensive, high quality.
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:37.181]  This is how you fight Big Brother.
[01:54:37.221 --> 01:54:42.583]  This is how you record government bureaucrats and others when they're trying to oppress you and then later lie about you.
[01:54:43.003 --> 01:54:45.003]  It is important for everyone to have these units.
[01:54:45.043 --> 01:54:46.084]  They're very inexpensive.
[01:54:46.124 --> 01:54:47.164]  Diginet.net.
[01:54:47.484 --> 01:54:49.905]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:54:50.345 --> 01:54:53.266]  Diginet.net, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:53.826 --> 01:54:54.227]  I don't know.
[01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:16.773]  And they have a great little solar generator control unit and battery system.
[01:55:16.813 --> 01:55:22.898]  Very easy to store, very easy to use at mysolarbackup.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:55:22.918 --> 01:55:27.422]  That's 877-327-0365 to check out this awesome unit from the great folks at Solutions from Science.
[01:55:36.309 --> 01:55:37.129]  A great little unit.
[01:55:37.149 --> 01:55:42.351]  You get multiple units and start running your whole house off of these.
[01:55:42.371 --> 01:55:45.332]  877-327-0365 or MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:45.352 --> 01:55:45.952]  That's one word.
[01:55:46.292 --> 01:55:47.353]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:47.373 --> 01:55:52.955]  We have links on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:53.955 --> 01:56:00.737]  Again, the government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so let's take advantage of this today at MySolarBackup.com.
[01:56:01.117 --> 01:56:02.858]  All right, going back to Max Keiser.
[01:56:03.698 --> 01:56:16.484]  Max, on the economy overall, we have the economic numbers coming in, as you've been saying several years on this show and many years on your own television shows, that the banks are vertically integrating the economy.
[01:56:16.504 --> 01:56:17.804]  This is a criminal operation.
[01:56:17.824 --> 01:56:18.865]  You talk about Goldman Sachs.
[01:56:19.685 --> 01:56:20.266]  We're good.
[01:56:39.427 --> 01:56:40.368]  That's now confirmed.
[01:56:40.828 --> 01:56:41.149]  U.S.
[01:56:41.209 --> 01:56:43.591]  growth prospects deemed bleak in new decade.
[01:56:43.611 --> 01:56:47.336]  Reuters, personal bankruptcy filings rising fast for record levels.
[01:56:47.676 --> 01:56:53.582]  Robert Rubin now posing as the saver when he's one of the grand architects saying all hell could break loose if we don't fix our government debt.
[01:56:53.803 --> 01:56:54.964]  They want all these new taxes.
[01:56:54.984 --> 01:56:56.185]  They have Glenn Beck calling for it.
[01:56:56.906 --> 01:56:59.228]  You're a liberal commie if you're not for more taxes.
[01:56:59.889 --> 01:57:04.933]  Again, they can only have Obama launch wars as a liberal and only have fake conservatives call for new taxes.
[01:57:05.313 --> 01:57:07.315]  That's how this song and dance works.
[01:57:07.595 --> 01:57:10.017]  American job satisfaction falls a record low.
[01:57:10.338 --> 01:57:12.179]  Worst Christmas since 1979.
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.042]  Your comments on that quickly, Max Keiser.
[01:57:16.158 --> 01:57:26.205]  Well, the decade of the 1930s, the Depression, at the end of the decade, the market still managed to make 10%, including reinvestment of all dividends.
[01:57:26.685 --> 01:57:30.868]  The decade that just ended, the total return was a whopping zero.
[01:57:32.449 --> 01:57:35.772]  Now, the problem is that you can't have capitalism without capital.
[01:57:36.392 --> 01:57:39.574]  And you can't have capital unless people are saving money.
[01:57:39.895 --> 01:57:44.478]  And people can't save money unless they have jobs that pay them enough to save money.
[01:57:45.183 --> 01:57:52.149]  So unless that happens, which is not going to happen, because all the policies are geared toward making it easier for the banks to speculate.
[01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:54.291]  And speculating is not a job.
[01:57:54.652 --> 01:57:56.073]  Speculating is a vice.
[01:57:56.433 --> 01:58:01.498]  What is done on the level is being done on Wall Street, and is being helped along by Washington.
[01:58:01.758 --> 01:58:04.140]  So the business model of America is vice.
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:05.021]  It's speculation.
[01:58:05.061 --> 01:58:05.682]  It's castino.
[01:58:05.942 --> 01:58:09.645]  And the people getting victimized are being put into this American gulag.
[01:58:09.986 --> 01:58:11.507]  And whether you're being—how about this one?
[01:58:11.887 --> 01:58:14.508]  Prisoners use the shovel snowbound U.S.
[01:58:14.568 --> 01:58:15.008]  Capitol.
[01:58:15.648 --> 01:58:16.148]  The U.S.
[01:58:16.188 --> 01:58:19.428]  Capitol is paying prisoner inmates to shovel the sidewalks.
[01:58:19.928 --> 01:58:22.989]  Washington Post, you can't hire Americans to do it.
[01:58:23.729 --> 01:58:27.190]  They said they paid them $7 an hour, but 80% of that was given to the prison.
[01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:29.410]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:30.250]  It's slave labor.
[01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:31.110]  They're in the gulag.
[01:58:31.531 --> 01:58:34.911]  So they let the gulag people out for a few hours to shovel snow.
[01:58:36.211 --> 01:58:36.611]  Stay there.
[01:58:36.631 --> 01:58:38.492]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[01:58:38.512 --> 01:58:39.172]  Stay there, Max.
[01:58:39.212 --> 01:58:39.632]  Good point.

[01:58:56.599 --> 01:58:57.859]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:58:57.879 --> 01:58:58.560]  It's very real.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:00.841]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:59:00.941 --> 01:59:02.461]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:59:52.768 --> 01:59:54.688]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:57.830]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.187 --> 02:00:22.209]  Max Keiser does a show with the BBC, does a show on Russia Today.
[02:00:22.269 --> 02:00:24.010]  We're going to your calls here in just a moment.
[02:00:25.110 --> 02:00:28.212]  But Max, I noticed that a Russia Today ad
[02:00:29.494 --> 02:00:32.038]  A video ad on those big video screens for the airports.
[02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:35.022]  It's okay to have the global warming ads and the gun control ads.
[02:00:36.685 --> 02:00:37.105]  Simply...
[02:00:38.817 --> 02:00:40.718]  You know, said things, what's a more powerful weapon?
[02:00:40.758 --> 02:00:42.519]  A machine gun or a video camera?
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:43.740]  Russia Today.
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.621]  And that was censored, that wasn't allowed.
[02:00:45.641 --> 02:00:46.722]  And I watched Russia Today.
[02:00:47.262 --> 02:00:50.184]  They have video about their police being corrupt in Russia.
[02:00:50.645 --> 02:00:52.246]  They have video about eugenics.
[02:00:52.686 --> 02:00:54.647]  They have videos about world government.
[02:00:54.867 --> 02:00:57.149]  They have videos about climate change being a fraud.
[02:00:57.169 --> 02:01:01.572]  And it's like Russian TV is the free television.
[02:01:02.452 --> 02:01:05.397]  I mean, I can't believe the stuff that's on Russia today, exposing their own government.
[02:01:06.298 --> 02:01:09.464]  And then meanwhile, it's censored here and Bill O'Reilly is attacking it.
[02:01:10.276 --> 02:01:14.019]  Look, Russia Today is a fantastic network.
[02:01:14.079 --> 02:01:23.885]  They are doing to the English-speaking news world what Al Jazeera was supposed to do but was too timid and never stepped up to the plate, Al Jazeera English.
[02:01:24.105 --> 02:01:26.907]  They never did what they thought they would do.
[02:01:27.267 --> 02:01:28.448]  Russia Today is doing it.
[02:01:28.708 --> 02:01:30.890]  They're taking on the monopolists in the U.S.
[02:01:30.930 --> 02:01:34.092]  media space and they're going with the top stories.
[02:01:34.372 --> 02:01:35.853]  They're getting the great reporters.
[02:01:36.273 --> 02:01:38.035]  I'm doing a show on Russia Today, of course.
[02:01:38.835 --> 02:01:41.258]  Got to be considering that group of great reporters.
[02:01:41.938 --> 02:01:44.281]  But their ratings are skyrocketing.
[02:01:44.361 --> 02:01:45.682]  Their marketing is brilliant.
[02:01:46.262 --> 02:01:49.185]  And if you haven't seen Russia Today yet, they're brilliant on the web.
[02:01:49.205 --> 02:01:50.326]  They put everything on the web.
[02:01:50.627 --> 02:01:55.291]  On my show on Russia Today last week, they did a story on Bill O'Reilly.
[02:01:55.311 --> 02:01:57.954]  They said Bill O'Reilly was dissing Russia Today.
[02:01:58.374 --> 02:02:00.917]  And on my show, I slammed O'Reilly.
[02:02:01.437 --> 02:02:06.422]  You know, in a way that I thought he would have responded to, but I guess he's too much of a chicken.
[02:02:06.882 --> 02:02:18.792]  I called him a coprophagist, which your listening audience can look up on dictionary.com, and basically he's eating the product of his own spew, and I haven't heard yet from O'Reilly.
[02:02:18.852 --> 02:02:21.194]  I challenged him to come on my show, but he's such a chicken.
[02:02:21.234 --> 02:02:26.419]  He's such a Murdoch creation guy, little boy, hiding in his room, playing with his
[02:02:26.639 --> 02:02:34.365]  Well, he now gets up almost every night and calls for sales taxes and excise taxes as the conservative thing to do to pay the bankers.
[02:02:35.006 --> 02:02:37.628]  You've got Iceland being seized by the bankers.
[02:02:37.988 --> 02:02:40.870]  I mean, this guy is a, he poses as a populist.
[02:02:41.211 --> 02:02:42.331]  This guy is a nightmare.
[02:02:43.512 --> 02:02:45.494]  Well, you know, he's also, he's a coward.
[02:02:45.794 --> 02:02:51.479]  In other words, if I went on his show, I would reduce him to a puddle of tears in about 15 seconds.
[02:02:52.481 --> 02:02:56.062]  But Murdoch's never going to let me go on Bill O'Reilly's show on Fox News Show.
[02:02:56.082 --> 02:03:01.164]  You know, I've been offered to be on ABC, Fox and others in debates, but they always want to tape it.
[02:03:01.804 --> 02:03:03.905]  They always want to tape it so they can edit it out.
[02:03:06.726 --> 02:03:12.448]  So I've decided I won't travel for the taping, but I will travel, I mean I will sit here and let them come here.
[02:03:12.768 --> 02:03:19.490]  So I do have one of the big three cable networks coming in two weeks, and I'm sure it's going to be a disaster, but these people are amazing.
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:23.622]  Well, they are protected just like the banks.
[02:03:24.482 --> 02:03:27.884]  Nobody can really go on their show and deal with them one-on-one.
[02:03:28.104 --> 02:03:31.526]  They're sending one of the biggest TV hosts in the country here to interview me.
[02:03:33.143 --> 02:03:34.244]  Well, it's fantastic.
[02:03:34.284 --> 02:03:38.746]  Like I said, you know, I have what I call Alex in Wonderland.
[02:03:38.846 --> 02:03:40.828]  Everything that you say is becoming true.
[02:03:41.208 --> 02:03:46.871]  You know, and two years ago, a year ago, things that were dismissed as conspiracy theory are becoming true.
[02:03:46.891 --> 02:03:51.554]  So you're waking up into your own dream of everything you've been saying is true.
[02:03:52.334 --> 02:03:54.956]  Didn't you say you're making a film called Alex in Wonderland?
[02:03:55.603 --> 02:03:59.406]  Yeah, it's listed on my site, PirateMyFilm.com.
[02:03:59.446 --> 02:04:05.151]  I also have a film on there called Broker Zero, about 9-11, which is kind of interesting.
[02:04:05.912 --> 02:04:08.834]  Yeah, but I want you to take this from the market of speculation, too.
[02:04:08.874 --> 02:04:10.556]  I'd like to see Alex in Wonderland.
[02:04:12.037 --> 02:04:16.541]  Well, it's on PirateMyFilm.com, so anybody who's a listserv can go to PirateMyFilm.com.
[02:04:16.581 --> 02:04:17.362]  They can sign up.
[02:04:17.662 --> 02:04:22.306]  They can indicate that when we achieve 100% of our financing needs,
[02:04:23.044 --> 02:04:32.790]  That they will be debited five bucks and then we'll go out and make the film and then we'll deliver to them a download plus I'll give them a cut of any of the ad revenues going forward.
[02:04:33.191 --> 02:04:45.639]  So worst case scenario is you get a great download uh then a better case scenario is you end up you end up getting five dollars back and then the best case scenario is that you get five dollars back plus you get a huge bonus.
[02:04:45.659 --> 02:04:48.781]  So it's up to the listeners to go to piratemyfilm.com and make
[02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:51.350]  Alex Jones in Wonderland.
[02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:52.711]  Alex in Wonderland in reality.
[02:04:53.512 --> 02:04:55.714]  We are not in Kansas anymore, as they say.
[02:04:56.114 --> 02:04:58.176]  Max Keiser, your phone call straight ahead.
[02:04:58.196 --> 02:04:58.737]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.598 --> 02:05:04.782]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:05:04.902 --> 02:05:06.884]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:05:06.984 --> 02:05:09.266]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:05:09.426 --> 02:05:11.288]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:05:11.708 --> 02:05:13.070]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:05:13.330 --> 02:05:14.371]  There is a solution.
[02:05:14.591 --> 02:05:22.596]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:05:59.517 --> 02:06:03.759]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.059 --> 02:06:08.141]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:08.401 --> 02:06:13.824]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:14.144 --> 02:06:14.604]  It's true.
[02:06:14.905 --> 02:06:19.447]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:19.767 --> 02:06:20.308]  Number 3.
[02:06:20.588 --> 02:06:23.871]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:24.172 --> 02:06:27.916]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.096 --> 02:06:28.636]  Number 4.
[02:06:28.897 --> 02:06:31.259]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:35.043]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:35.343 --> 02:06:35.544]  Number 5.
[02:06:36.104 --> 02:06:40.026]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:40.247 --> 02:06:45.029]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:49.352]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:49.492 --> 02:06:51.053]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.273 --> 02:06:55.876]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:59.997 --> 02:07:02.599]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:02.999 --> 02:07:07.962]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:08.322 --> 02:07:10.063]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:10.383 --> 02:07:15.206]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:15.386 --> 02:07:16.346]  How much do you want?
[02:07:16.567 --> 02:07:17.307]  When do you want it?
[02:07:17.687 --> 02:07:19.288]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:19.568 --> 02:07:20.389]  When will you need it?
[02:07:20.649 --> 02:07:22.710]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:23.951]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:24.191 --> 02:07:25.492]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.152 --> 02:07:28.094]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[02:07:28.234 --> 02:07:30.777]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:30.957 --> 02:07:34.160]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:34.561 --> 02:07:38.044]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:38.385 --> 02:07:39.366]  How much will you need?
[02:07:39.606 --> 02:07:40.227]  We don't know.
[02:07:40.507 --> 02:07:41.428]  How much do you want?
[02:07:41.608 --> 02:07:42.349]  All you can get.
[02:07:42.369 --> 02:07:43.350]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:43.630 --> 02:07:46.391]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:46.671 --> 02:07:47.792]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:48.772 --> 02:07:53.955]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:54.215 --> 02:07:56.876]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:57.016 --> 02:08:07.301]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:07.901 --> 02:08:10.883]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.219 --> 02:08:24.541]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to break down the full view of what's happening with the body scanners and why this is such an important issue and why we're going to develop a boycott in the next few days and launch it.
[02:08:25.242 --> 02:08:28.742]  All the details are at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:08:28.802 --> 02:08:33.243]  While I'm talking to Max and taking calls, let's put the images of what the scanners really show.
[02:08:33.283 --> 02:08:34.643]  The mainstream media is blurring these.
[02:08:34.983 --> 02:08:35.744]  This is your wife.
[02:08:35.904 --> 02:08:36.644]  This is your daughter.
[02:08:36.664 --> 02:08:37.404]  This is you.
[02:08:38.024 --> 02:08:39.305]  This is what they're going to be showing.
[02:08:39.325 --> 02:08:43.028]  This is of a, looks like a 25-year-old woman, completely naked in the scanners.
[02:08:43.428 --> 02:08:44.709]  This is what they really show.
[02:08:45.009 --> 02:08:48.172]  We have other photos from the scanners at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:48.812 --> 02:08:49.172]  Okay?
[02:08:50.774 --> 02:08:51.875]  Going back to Max Keiser.
[02:08:51.915 --> 02:08:53.236]  Max, let's take some calls quickly.
[02:08:53.396 --> 02:08:55.197]  Marvin in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:08:55.237 --> 02:08:55.677]  Go ahead.
[02:08:57.018 --> 02:08:59.240]  Alex Jones, you are the man.
[02:09:00.281 --> 02:09:05.465]  You know, I've been listening to your show probably about three or four months now.
[02:09:06.307 --> 02:09:10.771]  And it's confirmation of information that I got like 15 years ago.
[02:09:11.551 --> 02:09:13.253]  And I agree with Max.
[02:09:13.353 --> 02:09:15.254]  It's like Alex in Wonderland.
[02:09:15.435 --> 02:09:16.635]  Everything is coming true.
[02:09:17.016 --> 02:09:26.984]  Now my question to you is, is your program on the radio here anywhere in North Carolina, particularly Greensboro, High Point, Winston-Salem area?
[02:09:28.115 --> 02:09:30.897]  I believe I'm only on one station in North Carolina.
[02:09:32.419 --> 02:09:34.601]  We're on over 70 stations now.
[02:09:34.641 --> 02:09:35.481]  That sounds like a lot.
[02:09:35.521 --> 02:09:36.062]  It's really not.
[02:09:36.082 --> 02:09:37.343]  We're number one on the internet.
[02:09:37.743 --> 02:09:39.125]  We're also on WWCR.
[02:09:39.165 --> 02:09:42.407]  But no, the best place to get it for everybody is the free podcast.
[02:09:42.427 --> 02:09:44.069]  We deliver one hour after the show every day.
[02:09:44.129 --> 02:09:45.670]  All four hours free and high quality.
[02:09:46.090 --> 02:09:48.052]  Just go to the listen section of InfoWars.com.
[02:09:49.113 --> 02:09:50.514]  You can always listen to Global Shortwave.
[02:09:50.694 --> 02:09:54.777]  WWCR carries all four hours live, then re-airs at 9 p.m.
[02:09:54.817 --> 02:09:55.937]  Central to 1 a.m.
[02:09:55.977 --> 02:09:58.119]  Central on WWCR as well.
[02:09:58.519 --> 02:10:05.183]  Saturdays, they re-air four hours of the Friday Show on XM Radio, and that's a test they've been doing for a year.
[02:10:05.283 --> 02:10:07.104]  They know it gets high ratings, but they're scared of it.
[02:10:08.165 --> 02:10:09.746]  But anything else, Marvin?
[02:10:11.212 --> 02:10:21.301]  Yeah, I have a female friend that is an Obama lover in conjunction with the fact that I think she's actually suffering from Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:10:21.341 --> 02:10:22.942]  I learned about that in the military.
[02:10:23.643 --> 02:10:34.593]  And, you know, I've been told by some constituents of mine where if you're going to deal with it, you're going to have to help wake her up or otherwise, you know, you're not doing your job.
[02:10:35.273 --> 02:10:37.035]  So, any recommendations?
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:40.345]  Marvin, let me get a recommendation from Max Keiser.
[02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:43.352]  What's the best way to wake somebody up that doesn't want to be awake?
[02:10:44.916 --> 02:10:47.882]  Obama is to violence what Tiger Woods is to sex.
[02:10:51.061 --> 02:10:55.423]  Yeah, well, I think the Tiger Woods thing, that's mostly a smear campaign.
[02:10:55.443 --> 02:10:56.323]  It's a distraction.
[02:10:56.663 --> 02:11:00.685]  No, but I mean, he's saying Tiger Woods is to sex what Obama is to violence.
[02:11:01.185 --> 02:11:06.287]  I mean, Obama is there to con liberals, just like Bush was there to con conservatives.
[02:11:06.608 --> 02:11:10.269]  These are Madison Avenue produced creatures who have no power.
[02:11:10.649 --> 02:11:13.170]  And so point out to her that he broke all his promises.
[02:11:14.131 --> 02:11:15.151]  Marvin, I appreciate your call.
[02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:19.553]  Go through some of the promises, Max, from your own view that Obama has broken royally.
[02:11:20.925 --> 02:11:23.727]  Well, it's just the repeal of a lot of the things that Bush did.
[02:11:23.747 --> 02:11:33.114]  I thought when he got into office, he was going to repeal a lot of those policies that Bush put into place in terms of extraordinary rendition, torture, kidnapping.
[02:11:33.514 --> 02:11:34.395]  I thought he would repeal them.
[02:11:34.695 --> 02:11:38.798]  But not only has he not repealed them, but he's made them more onerous and more restrictive.
[02:11:38.858 --> 02:11:40.539]  So he's actually doing a lot worse.
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:43.762]  He's just taken the ball and run with it and made it a lot worse.
[02:11:45.629 --> 02:11:50.691]  Yeah, things have gotten worse, and they'll get worse under the Republican savior coming in three years.
[02:11:52.052 --> 02:12:06.078]  Well, because the, all the policy, you know, you've got a government that's been captured by the professional speculators on Wall Street, and they wanted, their objective, the business model, is to get cheap money, and not have to pay for any of their losing bets.
[02:12:06.558 --> 02:12:07.819]  Marvin, what you do is,
[02:12:08.973 --> 02:12:13.674]  You explained to her that Obama works for the very same bankers that ran Clinton, that ran Bush.
[02:12:13.694 --> 02:12:14.655]  You can give them the names.
[02:12:15.575 --> 02:12:22.297]  And that it's the same system and that she needs to get past the puppets and to the real power behind the throne.
[02:12:22.737 --> 02:12:23.677]  It's that simple.
[02:12:23.697 --> 02:12:27.599]  Take her behind the stage, behind the curtain, behind the movie screen.
[02:12:27.959 --> 02:12:29.559]  Omar in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:32.980]  Hey Alex, thanks for all your hard work.
[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:33.921]  I'm a first time caller.
[02:12:34.861 --> 02:12:35.321]  Welcome.
[02:12:36.243 --> 02:12:38.824]  Thanks for infiltrating Bohemian Grove.
[02:12:38.864 --> 02:12:40.905]  That woke my brother up to the New World Order, by the way.
[02:12:41.866 --> 02:12:42.166]  Awesome.
[02:12:43.087 --> 02:12:46.068]  And thanks to you, Max Keiser, for all your hard work.
[02:12:47.349 --> 02:12:51.291]  I heard you say that our dollar was going to become like toilet paper.
[02:12:51.671 --> 02:12:57.894]  For the everyday man, what would you advise, like if you only had a couple thousand to work with, what would you advise me to do?
[02:12:57.955 --> 02:13:01.296]  Because I'm worried about the economic collapse and all this hyperinflation.
[02:13:01.636 --> 02:13:02.477]  What do you advise?
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:13.702]  Well, okay, I'm not giving investment advice, but I will tell you that the obvious play here is that everything, all the currencies, including the U.S.
[02:13:13.742 --> 02:13:23.223]  dollar, are going to be deflating against gold bullion, and I would buy gold bullion outside of the United States.
[02:13:23.603 --> 02:13:32.605]  Goldmoney.com is the only place that I know of, the best place that I know of, where you can actually buy gold bullion and have it being held outside of the United States.
[02:13:33.525 --> 02:13:37.967]  Well, Max, my issue is that I don't hold paper certificates in gold.
[02:13:38.087 --> 02:13:41.008]  I don't put my gold in some faraway vault in another country.
[02:13:41.028 --> 02:13:48.670]  I know you think it's safe to not be grabbed overseas, but look what's happening to the Swiss and all those bank accounts and things being grabbed.
[02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:52.712]  I'll tell you where I get my gold, physically hold it, it's MidasResources.com.
[02:13:52.732 --> 02:13:56.913]  But regardless, I agree with you, gold is the place for people to invest.
[02:13:56.953 --> 02:13:59.094]  Thank you so much, Omar in Illinois.
[02:13:59.414 --> 02:14:08.706]  But briefly, what will it look like as the dollar, which they've gone from debating should we get rid of it, to how will we get rid of it?
[02:14:09.006 --> 02:14:13.352]  How do you see that process of the slow death of the dollar, or will it be a fast death?
[02:14:13.432 --> 02:14:15.575]  It's been a slow death, but steadily down.
[02:14:15.915 --> 02:14:17.558]  How do you see that taking place?
[02:14:18.885 --> 02:14:31.378]  Well, I think we're seeing it happen right now with the IMF is very active in Europe right now with the special drawing rights, which are a composite or a currency that's really an accounting entry in book form.
[02:14:31.398 --> 02:14:39.587]  And they are getting ready to do a recalibration of the global currency grid and everything will be exchanged into the special drawing rights.
[02:14:40.047 --> 02:14:40.768]  I think so.
[02:15:00.379 --> 02:15:08.962]  Which means that all the major fiat currencies are going to be thrown into a special drawing right and then spilled back out at a ratio that will quote unquote rebalance the economy.
[02:15:09.202 --> 02:15:12.224]  The biggest loser in that scenario is the U.S.
[02:15:12.304 --> 02:15:12.644]  dollar.
[02:15:12.804 --> 02:15:19.707]  By far, it's going to take a haircut of between 30 and 40 percent, similar to the haircut it took under FDR.
[02:15:19.847 --> 02:15:25.129]  It took a 40 percent haircut as a way to revalue the dollar.
[02:15:25.209 --> 02:15:28.070]  And I would anticipate something like that again and coming soon.
[02:15:31.081 --> 02:15:33.222]  All right, let's quickly take another call here.
[02:15:33.282 --> 02:15:34.944]  Let's talk to David in Washington.
[02:15:34.964 --> 02:15:36.164]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:15:36.204 --> 02:15:36.565]  Go ahead.
[02:15:37.365 --> 02:15:37.946]  Hey, Alex.
[02:15:38.486 --> 02:15:39.026]  How are you?
[02:15:39.386 --> 02:15:39.627]  Good.
[02:15:40.347 --> 02:15:40.547]  Good.
[02:15:41.648 --> 02:15:46.871]  You know, you were talking about Russia today and, you know, how it covers news that American media won't cover.
[02:15:47.472 --> 02:15:51.735]  And, you know, I was talking to my parents and they, you know, they came from Russia, too.
[02:15:52.175 --> 02:15:53.296]  And they say, you know,
[02:15:55.187 --> 02:15:56.728]  They understand what is happening.
[02:15:57.388 --> 02:16:00.589]  They went through the same exact thing with the communists.
[02:16:00.609 --> 02:16:10.532]  You know, my mom was just laughing the other day saying, you know, we came here, we ran away from the system, and we just, we came back to the system here in America.
[02:16:13.573 --> 02:16:15.153]  But it's a more high-tech version.
[02:16:15.213 --> 02:16:16.233]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:16.834 --> 02:16:17.794]  Comments on that, Max?
[02:16:18.655 --> 02:16:24.861]  Well, it's amazing that America seems that they have to censor ads from Russia today.
[02:16:24.881 --> 02:16:34.251]  They don't have enough faith in their own population to be able to sort through what they feel is material that is not in their interest.
[02:16:34.611 --> 02:16:39.493]  And so the federal government is saying, you know, we don't even want you to be exposed to anything.
[02:16:39.994 --> 02:16:46.837]  We want total control over the total global media footprint, which is, of course, the hallmark of an empire.
[02:16:47.317 --> 02:16:49.158]  And let's get down to brass tacks, Al.
[02:16:49.338 --> 02:16:59.743]  The reason why Al Jazeera English and Russia Today are not, you know, they're seen by the Fox News and the CNBC as competition, and just like the banks on Wall Street,
[02:17:00.524 --> 02:17:01.525]  In other parts of the economy.
[02:17:01.545 --> 02:17:02.566]  They don't want competition.
[02:17:02.866 --> 02:17:03.787]  And they don't want Russia Today.
[02:17:03.967 --> 02:17:04.928]  They don't want Al Jazeera English.
[02:17:04.948 --> 02:17:06.109]  They don't want to compete with anybody.
[02:17:06.129 --> 02:17:06.950]  They want a monopoly.
[02:17:07.130 --> 02:17:08.011]  They want all the viewers.
[02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:11.695]  They want to say what they want to say without getting challenged in any way over there at Fox News.
[02:17:11.715 --> 02:17:12.556]  And let me say this.
[02:17:12.716 --> 02:17:16.539]  Al Jazeera got big by being a little more open.
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:21.684]  But once they got big, they've gotten as mainline as Fox News in my opinion now.
[02:17:22.245 --> 02:17:22.545]  And CNN.
[02:17:23.806 --> 02:17:27.749]  Russia today is being super radical, exposing their own government, our government.
[02:17:27.829 --> 02:17:29.490]  I can't believe the stuff that's on there.
[02:17:30.350 --> 02:17:32.172]  It's as if I'm programming it or something.
[02:17:32.232 --> 02:17:33.292]  It's just amazing.
[02:17:34.954 --> 02:17:40.898]  And let's hope that once they get the giant market share, because they're smart, that they continue with what they've been doing.
[02:17:40.918 --> 02:17:51.425]  Because I remember Bill O'Reilly, ten years ago, he was having Tony Brown on, of Tony Brown's journal, talking about the Illuminati and the New World Order.
[02:17:51.705 --> 02:17:53.166]  So he built his audience
[02:17:53.806 --> 02:17:55.787]  I mean, did you see O'Reilly 10, 12 years ago?
[02:17:55.807 --> 02:17:57.148]  It was like anti-New World Order.
[02:17:57.368 --> 02:18:08.575]  He built that giant audience, giving people what they want, the truth, and then, but he only did it for two years, and then flip-flopped, and then just gets worse and worse, and now he says you're a dirty communist if you don't want more taxes.
[02:18:08.675 --> 02:18:09.676]  I mean, you know, it's sick.
[02:18:10.316 --> 02:18:16.620]  I'll give you another huge flip-flop, which is, you know, amazing, is, you know, Bono from the group U2.
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:18.641]  He wants total internet police state.
[02:18:19.101 --> 02:18:19.782]  Yeah, like China.
[02:18:19.942 --> 02:18:21.603]  He holds China up as an example.
[02:18:23.143 --> 02:18:33.391]  You know, and this is like My Side Pirate My Film is meant to challenge this whole Bono thought that, you know, the copyright needs to be protected for perpetuity.
[02:18:33.631 --> 02:18:37.314]  That is, that's like giving the population an intellectual
[02:18:38.715 --> 02:18:39.896]  Max, we're out of time.
[02:18:58.246 --> 02:18:59.047]  Max, we're out of time.
[02:18:59.087 --> 02:18:59.948]  Incredible interview.
[02:19:00.248 --> 02:19:04.131]  Look forward to talking to you again soon, being on your Russia Today TV show.
[02:19:04.471 --> 02:19:06.053]  It was good being on the British show and others.
[02:19:06.813 --> 02:19:11.077]  And in the last 30 seconds, I hope everybody gets Fall of the Republic on DVD.
[02:19:11.117 --> 02:19:12.178]  You're a big part of the film.
[02:19:12.198 --> 02:19:14.600]  A lot of people think you're the most powerful part.
[02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:16.081]  What do you think of Fall of the Republic?
[02:19:17.022 --> 02:19:22.326]  I think the people who consider me to be the most powerful part of the film are absolutely right.
[02:19:23.387 --> 02:19:24.929]  But what do you think of the documentary itself?
[02:19:26.181 --> 02:19:28.303]  I think it's a great follow-up to the Obama Deception.
[02:19:28.343 --> 02:19:40.832]  You know, if you watch those two films together, if you have the time to sit down and watch Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, it's the one-two punch, that's all you need to know to see things in the light you need to, you know, survive this next ten years.
[02:19:40.892 --> 02:19:43.994]  Yeah, Marvin needs to show this to his girlfriend that won't wake up.
[02:19:44.354 --> 02:19:45.916]  Max, it was great having you on with us.
[02:19:45.956 --> 02:19:47.877]  Thank you so much for joining us early in the new year.
[02:19:48.417 --> 02:19:48.938]  Alright, thanks buddy.
[02:19:50.379 --> 02:19:52.001]  2010, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:52.242 --> 02:19:55.226]  The year we're going to really start moving towards bringing down the New World Order.
[02:19:55.506 --> 02:19:57.068]  We're going to have even more victories this year.
[02:19:57.088 --> 02:19:59.371]  We'll be right back with the Body Scanners.

[02:21:01.206 --> 02:21:04.868]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:05.208 --> 02:21:08.230]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:08.470 --> 02:21:09.891]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:10.569 --> 02:21:13.252]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:13.272 --> 02:21:19.437]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:19.638 --> 02:21:24.682]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:24.843 --> 02:21:34.832]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:34.932 --> 02:21:35.572]  Tim Geithner?
[02:21:35.793 --> 02:21:36.233]  Bernanke?
[02:21:36.273 --> 02:21:37.033]  They're arsonists!
[02:21:37.273 --> 02:21:38.614]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:38.874 --> 02:21:41.216]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:41.336 --> 02:21:43.177]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:43.437 --> 02:21:48.240]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:48.601 --> 02:21:53.383]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:53.604 --> 02:21:57.726]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:01.659 --> 02:22:02.700]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:08.582]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:22:09.143 --> 02:22:09.643]  That's right.
[02:22:09.963 --> 02:22:12.244]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:22:12.564 --> 02:22:19.728]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:22:20.288 --> 02:22:27.972]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:28.433 --> 02:22:33.275]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:22:33.916 --> 02:22:36.937]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:39.719 --> 02:22:43.841]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:22:44.222 --> 02:22:44.482]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:44.502 --> 02:22:46.403]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:22:46.483 --> 02:22:46.803]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.083 --> 02:22:47.363]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:12.077 --> 02:23:13.398]  PureBulk.com.

[02:24:22.315 --> 02:24:23.455]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:23.535 --> 02:24:24.515]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:24:24.555 --> 02:24:28.736]  We have 40 minutes left in the syndicated radio transmission.
[02:24:29.837 --> 02:24:31.237]  I am now going to give you the complete
[02:24:32.373 --> 02:24:40.377]  Overview on the basics of the airport naked body scanners and exactly why this is being done.
[02:24:42.418 --> 02:24:52.123]  We are being incrementally taught that what goes on in the airports will then happen on the streets and schools and shopping malls and bus terminals and train terminals of America.
[02:24:53.603 --> 02:25:01.107]  Seven years ago Homeland Security newly sworn in director Governor Ridge had a two-hour symposium on C-SPAN that I happened to cross at home
[02:25:02.622 --> 02:25:09.543]  And I've done, of course, countless amounts of research after that, where he said, the no-fly will be a no-buy, a no-work.
[02:25:09.723 --> 02:25:11.484]  Everyone will have a national ID card.
[02:25:11.804 --> 02:25:16.344]  If you haven't paid taxes or have bad credit, you won't be able to fly or have jobs.
[02:25:16.384 --> 02:25:27.526]  You'll go to the government to be put on a form of probation outside of law, outside of the courts, to be able to go get your job and do community service for them, like prisoners snuggling snow in D.C.
[02:25:28.186 --> 02:25:29.447]  Citizens can't have those jobs.
[02:25:30.507 --> 02:25:30.927]  Slavery.
[02:25:33.035 --> 02:25:56.429]  And they started out, and Napolitano's on record now, saying we're gonna incrementally, Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister of England's on record saying, we're putting the body scanners in at every airport, Europe's putting them in, all at the same time, right on cue, they start putting them in, in the weeks before the underwear bomber strikes, they hype it right on time, and they are saying,
[02:25:57.725 --> 02:25:59.447]  That they are going to put them in every airport.
[02:25:59.467 --> 02:26:00.268]  They're going in Austin.
[02:26:00.288 --> 02:26:01.129]  They're going in everywhere.
[02:26:01.149 --> 02:26:02.351]  They're going in where I live.
[02:26:02.991 --> 02:26:07.877]  And the next year they're going to phase in where everyone has to go through them.
[02:26:07.897 --> 02:26:09.579]  They 360 body scan you.
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:14.024]  They have serious health effects according to scientific reports we're going to go over.
[02:26:14.926 --> 02:26:19.408]  They record a digital biometric image of your body, just like your thumbprint or your face scan.
[02:26:19.648 --> 02:26:34.615]  It's even more accurate to have your body 360 scanned than they keep that in a database, just like they've now declassified, 14 years after I first broke it, that all babies for 37 years in the Western world under a secret UN genome project have had their blood taken at birth.
[02:26:36.852 --> 02:26:39.755]  In fact, Google that article out of the Austin American Statesman.
[02:26:39.855 --> 02:26:41.997]  State destroys 4 million blood samples of babies.
[02:26:42.317 --> 02:26:45.400]  Just starting that because people are finally waking up from this show and suing.
[02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:46.501]  People won't believe that.
[02:26:46.521 --> 02:26:47.142]  I want them to see it.
[02:26:47.562 --> 02:26:52.227]  We'll also put on screen what is really seen with these scanners.
[02:26:52.267 --> 02:26:53.868]  The media is showing you blurred images.
[02:26:53.888 --> 02:26:54.929]  There's so many facets.
[02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:57.111]  I'm going to try to cover it.
[02:26:57.151 --> 02:27:00.715]  But first, how many reports have you seen on the news?
[02:27:02.429 --> 02:27:06.911]  Of women being forced to drink their own breast milk when it's in a baby bottle for them.
[02:27:07.892 --> 02:27:12.694]  First, you're not supposed to breastfeed on a plane because it freaks people out, but the naked body scanners are good.
[02:27:13.035 --> 02:27:16.076]  Everything natural is bad, everything unnatural and evil is good.
[02:27:18.998 --> 02:27:21.939]  How many people do they beat to death and taser to death in airports?
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:26.602]  In Hawaii, baby detained dies in Honolulu Airport.
[02:27:27.102 --> 02:27:30.784]  Associated Press, MSNBC, I'll show PrisonPlanet.tv viewers a close shot.
[02:27:32.591 --> 02:27:35.892]  They came in, they had their IDs, they had everything, they just decided to hold them.
[02:27:36.132 --> 02:27:37.332]  The baby died.
[02:27:38.952 --> 02:27:40.072]  So there's all of that abuse.
[02:27:41.573 --> 02:27:43.573]  Notice how they've cycled up the abuse.
[02:27:43.633 --> 02:27:45.913]  First, after 9-11, they start questioning you.
[02:27:45.933 --> 02:27:47.033]  They create a no-fly list.
[02:27:47.073 --> 02:27:56.975]  Now they have bills to make it a no-buy list, where they secretly put you on a list, over a million Americans, $25,000 a month put on it, but every time there's a real terrorist who's even on it, they let them in.
[02:28:00.176 --> 02:28:01.336]  So we have that going on.
[02:28:03.464 --> 02:28:10.386]  And then they start having you take your shoes off and your belt off and untuck your shirt and open up your laptop and tell them what's on your computer.
[02:28:10.666 --> 02:28:16.407]  TSA announced two years ago they would start seizing computers randomly and downloading their contents without warrants.
[02:28:17.927 --> 02:28:20.968]  Charging people for tax offenses that they found in the computers.
[02:28:22.729 --> 02:28:26.950]  If you fly internationally, mainline porn is illegal to transport it.
[02:28:27.250 --> 02:28:32.271]  You know, of two 30-year-old people having sex, a man and a woman, that's illegal.
[02:28:34.417 --> 02:28:37.841]  They are using this to go after everybody and catch them in this web.
[02:28:37.881 --> 02:28:45.409]  Then you have all the huge profits being made by Chertoff, the head of Homeland Security, who owns a bunch of stock in the main companies, out promoting it.
[02:28:45.709 --> 02:28:46.870]  Total conflicts of interest.
[02:28:46.890 --> 02:28:50.334]  Billions and billions a year spent on these systems.
[02:28:50.794 --> 02:28:52.356]  Since I mentioned it, put it on screen.
[02:28:52.396 --> 02:28:54.839]  Texas to destroy baby blood taken without consent.
[02:28:55.930 --> 02:28:57.051]  And that's out of the AP.
[02:28:57.391 --> 02:28:58.712]  Your state's destroyed blood samples.
[02:28:58.752 --> 02:28:59.993]  That's the Austin American Statesman.
[02:29:00.314 --> 02:29:01.635]  San Antonio Express News.
[02:29:01.935 --> 02:29:04.637]  Again, this is the type of secret stuff that's been going on forever.
[02:29:06.979 --> 02:29:09.601]  My point is, is that they're in the business of violating your rights.
[02:29:09.741 --> 02:29:10.682]  It's all illegal.
[02:29:13.364 --> 02:29:14.305]  On top of that,
[02:29:15.856 --> 02:29:18.959]  The Amsterdam airport had the body scanners.
[02:29:19.019 --> 02:29:20.221]  He wasn't put through them.
[02:29:20.521 --> 02:29:21.762]  He didn't have a passport.
[02:29:21.782 --> 02:29:25.026]  The underwear bomber was led by a sharp-dressed man on board the plane.
[02:29:25.346 --> 02:29:26.988]  Someone videotaped the whole event.
[02:29:27.729 --> 02:29:30.352]  Then once they got off the plane, someone was reportedly found with a bomb.
[02:29:30.392 --> 02:29:31.072]  That was covered up.
[02:29:31.112 --> 02:29:33.115]  The FBI has not admitted they lied, but won't say why.
[02:29:34.997 --> 02:29:36.859]  Within minutes of that story breaking Sunday,
[02:29:38.928 --> 02:29:45.614]  On that Christmas, on that Friday, they had the body scanners on the news saying this is the solution to coincide with the release.
[02:29:45.975 --> 02:29:48.077]  We'll come back over all of it on the other side.
[02:29:48.097 --> 02:29:48.977]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.058 --> 02:29:50.959]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:53.061]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.002 --> 02:29:56.685]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:04.727]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:30:04.847 --> 02:30:06.790]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:30:06.930 --> 02:30:09.233]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:30:09.393 --> 02:30:11.236]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:30:11.656 --> 02:30:13.038]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:30:13.278 --> 02:30:14.340]  There is a solution.
[02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:22.565]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:01.227 --> 02:31:04.871]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:05.251 --> 02:31:08.274]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:08.494 --> 02:31:13.299]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:13.679 --> 02:31:19.525]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:19.685 --> 02:31:24.726]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:24.886 --> 02:31:28.007]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:31:28.147 --> 02:31:34.869]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:34.969 --> 02:31:37.090]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:37.330 --> 02:31:38.670]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:38.910 --> 02:31:41.211]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.371 --> 02:31:43.212]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:43.492 --> 02:31:48.173]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:49.133 --> 02:32:02.000]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:05.862]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[02:32:06.342 --> 02:32:13.026]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together, and food is always the expression of our
[02:32:17.691 --> 02:32:25.938]  Has the two things that you've asked for most easy to make prepared meals that taste great and a smaller than one year supply for greater affordability.
[02:32:26.159 --> 02:32:35.047]  I don't have to tell you that the troubled times and loss of freedoms that we only anticipated in 2008 have arrived in our lives with a vengeance.
[02:32:35.527 --> 02:32:44.470]  This holiday special is designed to bring peace and security to you and yours, and comes with a free 7-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate.
[02:32:44.690 --> 02:32:46.411]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:32:46.431 --> 02:32:47.111]  That's 800-409-5633.
[02:32:47.231 --> 02:32:50.812]  We here at eFoodsDirect wish you peace, security, and plenty this holiday season.
[02:33:06.403 --> 02:33:07.504]  Okay, we're back live.
[02:33:07.564 --> 02:33:08.925]  I'm clearing the phone lines.
[02:33:08.945 --> 02:33:25.215]  I'm going to do about a 10-minute analysis and breakdown of the body scanners that I want to hear specifically from callers on their ideas to boycott the airlines, the government, ways to stop this, what you're doing to expose it, to warn people, until the end of the transmission.
[02:33:28.601 --> 02:33:38.564]  Now, the London Independent reported, and they've had top security experts on, the headline is, Are Planned Airport Scanners Just a Scam?
[02:33:40.184 --> 02:33:46.126]  New technology that Gordon Brown relies on for his response to the Christmas Day bomb attack has been tested and found wanting.
[02:33:46.766 --> 02:33:56.449]  The explosive device smuggled in the clothing of the Detroit bomb suspect would not have been detected by body scanners set to be introduced in British airports, an expert on the technology warned last night.
[02:33:58.277 --> 02:33:59.578]  And again, I will state the key.
[02:34:00.318 --> 02:34:04.201]  Mainstream television and newspapers cannot show you the real images.
[02:34:04.501 --> 02:34:07.383]  There are thousands of them online, put out by the security companies.
[02:34:08.304 --> 02:34:13.608]  You can see every hair, every freckle, every fold of the male and female genitalia.
[02:34:13.648 --> 02:34:15.029]  Put it back on screen for people.
[02:34:15.729 --> 02:34:21.553]  And we have two key articles written by Paul Watson today that are up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:21.694 --> 02:34:24.836]  Alex Jones calls for mass resistance to implementation of body scanners.
[02:34:26.539 --> 02:34:30.960]  And of course, airports set to become primary peddlers of child porn.
[02:34:32.641 --> 02:34:34.581]  And we show you what the scanners really do.
[02:34:34.841 --> 02:34:36.201]  And you need to show everybody you know.
[02:34:36.662 --> 02:34:38.162]  It's one thing that you know about this.
[02:34:38.222 --> 02:34:41.343]  Taking action is what empowers you and what gives us victories.
[02:34:41.583 --> 02:34:44.383]  Just like we had over the global governance formation in Copenhagen.
[02:34:44.703 --> 02:34:45.964]  Just like we had over the flu.
[02:34:46.364 --> 02:34:50.505]  That whole fear-mongering event has been a complete defeat for the enemy.
[02:34:51.525 --> 02:34:54.686]  All the evidence and lawsuits and their attempts in New York and
[02:34:56.300 --> 02:34:59.042]  Massachusetts to make it law to make you take the shot failed.
[02:34:59.083 --> 02:35:00.224]  They tried to set that precedent.
[02:35:00.484 --> 02:35:01.164]  They failed!
[02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:03.767]  And if you take action, they will fail again!
[02:35:03.787 --> 02:35:12.534]  Now there's another key story we posted at PrisonPlanet.com and I've seen countless reports the last two years from universities and top scientists.
[02:35:12.755 --> 02:35:14.376]  We're lining a bunch of them up for the show.
[02:35:14.836 --> 02:35:17.339]  Full body scanners to fry travelers with radiation.
[02:35:18.629 --> 02:35:27.313]  The studies show that the x-ray type radiation is high-powered and can break up the DNA strands in the body.
[02:35:27.513 --> 02:35:27.973]  No kidding.
[02:35:28.033 --> 02:35:31.114]  It's also dangerous for the operators that run these systems.
[02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:34.436]  But again, I just showed you that photo of a naked woman in the body scanner.
[02:35:34.716 --> 02:35:38.318]  They always show the images on the news of someone with a gun or a knife.
[02:35:38.598 --> 02:35:41.699]  With these scans, the image is everyone that's scanned is guilty.
[02:35:42.139 --> 02:35:45.601]  That's the subconscious image that is put out there.
[02:35:47.068 --> 02:35:53.375]  I also want to add that the new body scanners break child porn laws in England and clearly in the U.S.
[02:35:53.415 --> 02:35:55.477]  and the London Guardian and the government admits that.
[02:35:55.778 --> 02:35:57.419]  Here's the article from the Guardian.
[02:35:58.504 --> 02:36:00.385]  New scanners break child porn laws.
[02:36:00.445 --> 02:36:03.206]  Now, remember this article I covered on Sunday's show?
[02:36:03.726 --> 02:36:15.291]  Microsoft seeks patent for office spy software where everyone will wear a bracelet that tracks their heart rate, their mood, an earpiece that tracks their brainwaves.
[02:36:15.711 --> 02:36:20.033]  This is medicalizing everything, making everyone be medically listed for something.
[02:36:20.673 --> 02:36:21.854]  They want to make all new cars.
[02:36:21.894 --> 02:36:29.399]  I saw this six years ago, GM, Toyota, with a digital camera scanner that picks up signs in the face if you're tired.
[02:36:29.699 --> 02:36:33.702]  It will dial the cell phone in the OnStar system and call police to come arrest you.
[02:36:34.082 --> 02:36:38.745]  I know people arrest and charged with DWI-like crimes all over the country.
[02:36:38.785 --> 02:36:41.587]  I know people personally in Austin for the cops saying they're tired.
[02:36:41.907 --> 02:36:44.108]  You get off work at 4 a.m., they say, hey, you tired?
[02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:44.849]  Yeah, I'm tired.
[02:36:45.229 --> 02:36:46.150]  Boom, handcuffs.
[02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:47.871]  Making everybody a criminal.
[02:36:51.289 --> 02:36:54.752]  Also, these are similar radiation to CT scans, CAT scans.
[02:36:55.012 --> 02:37:00.016]  They're putting in airports passive brain scanners at a distance that pick up your brain waves.
[02:37:00.657 --> 02:37:02.838]  That's been done in multiple airports around the U.S.
[02:37:02.878 --> 02:37:03.659]  and Europe since 2002.
[02:37:03.879 --> 02:37:09.284]  CBS News also reports new focus on danger of CT scans.
[02:37:10.379 --> 02:37:24.910]  Again, we mentioned how Chertoff and others are making millions of dollars apiece, billions total, off of, as the head of Homeland Security and the new head of Homeland Security, ordering these when they're also invested in the companies that's in the Boston Globe as well.
[02:37:26.251 --> 02:37:28.053]  Meanwhile, the TSA is countering.
[02:37:28.393 --> 02:37:32.416]  Washington Post tries to assuage privacy concerns about full-body scans.
[02:37:33.217 --> 02:37:35.758]  Already shoeless, beltless, it has come to this.
[02:37:36.864 --> 02:37:42.326]  And so they're now trying to say, oh, we're protecting you, oh, we're taking care of you, oh, we've enslaved you for your own good.
[02:38:07.921 --> 02:38:12.907]  Obama's playing the part of the big daddy out there saving us, doing this for all our own good.
[02:38:12.927 --> 02:38:16.130]  Gee, he doesn't want it to happen, but they've got top U.S.
[02:38:16.170 --> 02:38:16.551]  generals.
[02:38:16.591 --> 02:38:22.397]  I've got two articles on that on the news the last two days saying an airliner will be blown up in the next hundred days.
[02:38:22.877 --> 02:38:24.199]  We will be hit by terrorists.
[02:38:24.219 --> 02:38:25.801]  You better give up all your rights.
[02:38:29.929 --> 02:38:40.200]  Continuing here, I'm going to keep putting that image of the naked woman in the scanner, cutting to another TSA photo of a woman in the scanner with the man looking at the scanner of her naked body with a smile on his face.
[02:38:40.841 --> 02:38:43.384]  A picture does tell a million words, not a thousand.
[02:38:46.167 --> 02:38:46.788]  Continuing.
[02:38:48.171 --> 02:38:49.552]  They are isolating us all.
[02:38:49.572 --> 02:38:51.213]  They are training us to be hopeless.
[02:38:51.233 --> 02:38:52.934]  They are training us to submit to them.
[02:38:53.214 --> 02:38:54.675]  They are training us incrementally.
[02:38:55.175 --> 02:38:55.776]  No water.
[02:38:55.916 --> 02:38:56.496]  No milk.
[02:38:56.696 --> 02:38:57.597]  No baby food.
[02:38:58.197 --> 02:38:59.138]  No shampoo.
[02:38:59.438 --> 02:39:00.359]  Take your belt off.
[02:39:00.419 --> 02:39:01.399]  Take your shoes off.
[02:39:01.599 --> 02:39:03.240]  All acts of submission.
[02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:05.322]  Now you have to put your hands on your lap on the flight.
[02:39:05.562 --> 02:39:06.923]  Can't put a blanket over your lap.
[02:39:08.744 --> 02:39:12.806]  There's national events if somebody has diarrhea in the head on the airplanes.
[02:39:12.886 --> 02:39:15.807]  Obama's notified of a man in there for 20 minutes defecating.
[02:39:16.447 --> 02:39:21.270]  Again, just this culture of fear and everybody's scared and only Big Brother can save us.
[02:39:22.901 --> 02:39:37.990]  As they profit off of the control systems, not only at the top, but all these blue-collar workers that can't get jobs, now can get jobs in the TSA, which admits they're rolling out nationwide and in England as well, with mobile body scanners pulling up to bars, forcing everyone through it.
[02:39:38.890 --> 02:39:40.812]  Uh, arresting people for no reason.
[02:39:40.832 --> 02:39:47.597]  Uh, there was an Austin case a few years ago, and it goes all over Texas, where they come into, in one case, the Radisson Hotel.
[02:39:47.657 --> 02:39:48.858]  The guy was a business traveler.
[02:39:49.059 --> 02:39:50.800]  They watched him drink three beers at the counter.
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:54.683]  They arrested him for intoxication when he was at a hotel, didn't even have a car.
[02:39:55.003 --> 02:39:57.946]  Again, all about getting us in the system, making everyone a criminal.
[02:40:01.604 --> 02:40:04.146]  Conditioning us to accept all of this abuse.
[02:40:04.226 --> 02:40:05.847]  Setting up the face scanning cameras.
[02:40:05.927 --> 02:40:07.328]  The license plate reading cameras.
[02:40:07.548 --> 02:40:10.249]  They biometrically scan you with this body scanning system.
[02:40:10.289 --> 02:40:20.376]  Now they can, with passive scanners on the streets, already going in, shoot through your clothes and get your true identity because they match the scan with your personal ID when you go through the plane.
[02:40:21.036 --> 02:40:22.257]  When you go through the checkpoint.
[02:40:23.615 --> 02:40:26.576]  So again, mass humiliation, mass public humiliation.
[02:40:26.596 --> 02:40:36.140]  The TSA employees themselves, unless they hired the most horrible criminals like Homeland Security has for their private prisons, and like the Pentagon hired jail guards with histories of rape and abuse.
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:41.763]  That came out to run Abu Ghraib and hundreds of other camps around the world who like to rape people.
[02:40:42.403 --> 02:40:44.884]  The sexualization of torture, that all came out.
[02:40:45.024 --> 02:40:47.925]  All the torture based around raping people's children in front of them.
[02:40:48.166 --> 02:40:49.206]  The Army's own report.
[02:40:49.246 --> 02:40:50.386]  General Togumba's own report.
[02:40:50.406 --> 02:40:51.227]  In fact, pull up
[02:40:52.027 --> 02:40:56.090]  Army's report on torture, MSNBC, General Togumbo, put that on screen, people won't believe it.
[02:40:56.410 --> 02:40:59.152]  Raping children with battery acid, raping children in front of their parents.
[02:40:59.372 --> 02:41:00.633]  You go read the Army's own report.
[02:41:03.074 --> 02:41:04.775]  Okay, so we have all of that going on.
[02:41:04.815 --> 02:41:09.258]  We need to discuss how we boycott them, the most successful and focused way to do it.
[02:41:09.678 --> 02:41:13.061]  I will not be taking any pleasure flights, I never do anyways.
[02:41:13.481 --> 02:41:16.223]  I never allowed my children to fly, because stuff like this could happen.
[02:41:17.842 --> 02:41:19.765]  Uh, they could be tasered, they could be killed, anything.
[02:41:20.045 --> 02:41:22.109]  But you need to cut back on business.
[02:41:22.209 --> 02:41:23.871]  Do more teleconferencing.
[02:41:24.312 --> 02:41:27.457]  Let the airlines know every time you don't fly, you did it because of this.
[02:41:27.938 --> 02:41:29.961]  Because here's the key to the legalese.
[02:41:30.442 --> 02:41:32.144]  They say it's a privilege to drive a car.
[02:41:33.342 --> 02:41:35.743]  They say it's a privilege to fly, a privilege to own a gun.
[02:41:35.983 --> 02:41:37.484]  All of that is a lie.
[02:41:37.564 --> 02:41:39.945]  In the 1920s, heavy trucks began to drive on the roads.
[02:41:40.685 --> 02:41:46.548]  So they went to people in New Jersey and New York State and said, don't you want to tax on these truckers making all this money?
[02:41:46.828 --> 02:41:49.289]  The public said, oh yes, we don't want them making money, we're greedy.
[02:41:50.109 --> 02:41:55.034]  You know, they played that psychological divide-and-conquer tactic, and so they made truckers get a license.
[02:41:55.515 --> 02:41:58.178]  Then, by the 50s, everybody had to get a paper license.
[02:41:58.538 --> 02:41:59.599]  Now they put points on it.
[02:41:59.639 --> 02:42:00.980]  Now they restrict it.
[02:42:01.181 --> 02:42:03.503]  Now it's a national ID card through the Real ID Act.
[02:42:03.743 --> 02:42:08.168]  Now they have a hemispheric North American Union ID card you can get to travel in North America.
[02:42:08.548 --> 02:42:10.050]  We're already going into this system.
[02:42:11.587 --> 02:42:20.416]  Commerce on the roads, they've passed laws, is a privilege to go get a commercial driver's license, not to get the regular license.
[02:42:20.476 --> 02:42:21.678]  But, same thing with the airports.
[02:42:22.499 --> 02:42:25.302]  They go into the big airport companies,
[02:42:26.618 --> 02:42:27.559]  Government paid for.
[02:42:27.619 --> 02:42:29.420]  Government facilities with private contracts.
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:30.841]  They go to the big private airlines.
[02:42:31.421 --> 02:42:37.345]  Notice private aviation, general aviation, private jets, private Cessnas, Lear jets.
[02:42:37.365 --> 02:42:38.126]  They don't have to do this.
[02:42:38.786 --> 02:42:41.148]  It's because of deals made with the private corporations.
[02:42:41.188 --> 02:42:45.631]  They gave the airlines $25 billion in 2002 as the payoff to agree to all of this.
[02:42:45.871 --> 02:42:47.111]  They give them billions more each year.
[02:42:48.012 --> 02:42:52.254]  They pay them to lobby and to accept, saying it's our policy.
[02:42:52.554 --> 02:43:03.299]  And the feds come in, out of their jurisdiction, taking over the airports as their jurisdiction, unlawfully, and make you go through all these different screening procedures and naked body scanners now.
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:06.360]  Do you see how they're operating?
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:08.141]  Do you see how they're getting away with this?
[02:43:09.656 --> 02:43:13.457]  Because they make the deal with the airlines to force you to do it.
[02:43:13.817 --> 02:43:18.038]  Then the TSA expands to the trains, to the malls, to the streets.
[02:43:18.358 --> 02:43:26.820]  They have TSA Viper teams in Houston running checkpoints in Miami, Florida, in New York City, suddenly at New Year's Eve events in LA and New York and all over the place.
[02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:29.240]  Troops, regular troops, are out there.
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:32.481]  Troop checkpoints, National Guard searching people, wanting them.
[02:43:33.081 --> 02:43:36.062]  Just more and more conditioning, more and more bringing you into this.
[02:43:38.908 --> 02:43:41.370]  And remember, the Amsterdam airport had the body scanners.
[02:43:44.093 --> 02:43:56.805]  Until we have a broken people, through the Stockholm Syndrome, that submit to this, and if you'll submit to naked body scanners, and knowing your family's being recorded, and knowing you're being biometrically scanned, you'll put up with anything.
[02:43:58.362 --> 02:44:09.867]  Meanwhile, we have all the billboards and all the TV ads and radio ads and propaganda placement in the dramas on television and these news programs about how torture's good, secret arrest is good, sexual abuse is good.
[02:44:09.887 --> 02:44:13.449]  Did you guys find the MSNBC Army's report on torture, General Togumbo?
[02:44:15.290 --> 02:44:15.910]  Yeah, I want it up.
[02:44:16.010 --> 02:44:16.510]  I want to show people.
[02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:17.351]  I don't want to just say something.
[02:44:17.371 --> 02:44:17.951]  I want them to see it.
[02:44:18.671 --> 02:44:20.332]  I know it's real, but they need to be faced with it.
[02:44:22.884 --> 02:44:25.125]  So all of this is how the government's our big daddy.
[02:44:25.145 --> 02:44:26.166]  They're going to take care of us.
[02:44:26.206 --> 02:44:26.846]  They're the boss.
[02:44:27.167 --> 02:44:33.390]  Literally half the billboards when I drove to Dallas to interview Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, half the billboards were report illegal guns, report child abuse.
[02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:34.711]  The government cares about you.
[02:44:34.751 --> 02:44:37.973]  Flashing billboards about a grandma who's got Alzheimer's.
[02:44:38.313 --> 02:44:39.714]  Always meant to sound reasonable.
[02:44:39.954 --> 02:44:43.196]  Now suddenly the billboards are saying report terrorists, report illegal guns.
[02:44:43.697 --> 02:44:47.399]  Now they're putting out the Orwellian running man type messages.
[02:44:49.079 --> 02:44:56.584]  So again, if they tried to make TSA people actually take women, children, in and strip them, people would physically realize how abusive this is.
[02:44:56.604 --> 02:45:12.155]  But by having the instrumentality of a machine, a quackery, it has this scientific glow to it, like it's okay if the man is looking at a scan of your wife's most detailed body parts on her breasts and genitals and caboose.
[02:45:13.015 --> 02:45:14.977]  It doesn't matter if all of that's going on.
[02:45:15.017 --> 02:45:18.159]  It doesn't matter if your five-year-old son or daughter are being put through it and they're being recorded.
[02:45:18.519 --> 02:45:19.160]  It's okay.
[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:28.646]  And public schools from Tennessee, Missouri, and California have all been caught in mainstream news recording girls in the showers, putting it on police databases, sharing it.
[02:45:30.368 --> 02:45:32.809]  So all of this government data they always grab gets leaked.
[02:45:32.889 --> 02:45:33.850]  We know this will be leaked.
[02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:35.411]  Of Hollywood stars and others.
[02:45:37.112 --> 02:45:38.774]  So it's literally a strip search.
[02:45:39.454 --> 02:45:41.876]  People need to realize that that is what it's doing.
[02:45:43.407 --> 02:45:45.509]  And again, we have the sexualization of torture.
[02:45:45.869 --> 02:45:47.290]  We have the White House pushing it.
[02:45:47.610 --> 02:45:49.972]  We have it continuing, expanding under Obama.
[02:45:53.495 --> 02:46:08.346]  And the biggest group, the number one body of scholarships for college and community college now, especially intercity youth, they have Homeland Security through the police departments taking over the Boy Scouts Explorer program.
[02:46:08.726 --> 02:46:10.288]  3,000 graduates in LA alone this year.
[02:46:10.928 --> 02:46:11.168]  I think?
[02:46:26.886 --> 02:46:30.587]  So that's another way to go after this, is with the insider payoffs, the graft, the corruption.
[02:46:30.847 --> 02:46:31.887]  And that is the basic rundown.
[02:46:56.401 --> 02:46:57.202]  On all of this.
[02:46:57.222 --> 02:46:59.023]  There's a lot of other facets.
[02:46:59.043 --> 02:46:59.984]  Here's the Boston Globe.
[02:47:00.024 --> 02:47:05.308]  Group slams Chert off on scanner promotion because he's making money off of it with his security consulting.
[02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:06.309]  Here's the Boston Globe.
[02:47:06.569 --> 02:47:07.350]  Close shot of that.
[02:47:07.650 --> 02:47:09.191]  There's the Army report right there.
[02:47:09.611 --> 02:47:09.832]  U.S.
[02:47:09.872 --> 02:47:11.533]  Army report on Iraqi prisoner abuse.
[02:47:11.573 --> 02:47:12.934]  The actual report, 2004.
[02:47:13.695 --> 02:47:17.758]  Raping children with battery acid.
[02:47:19.321 --> 02:47:20.322]  In front of their parents.
[02:47:21.103 --> 02:47:22.184]  That's who runs things.
[02:47:22.424 --> 02:47:24.826]  This is psychopaths setting up their wonderland.
[02:47:25.146 --> 02:47:26.507]  Setting up their psychology.
[02:47:26.908 --> 02:47:28.890]  Selling you with all the TV and movie heroes.
[02:47:28.930 --> 02:47:30.751]  Torturing people's children to get the answers.
[02:47:31.012 --> 02:47:32.293]  And the real world is going on.
[02:47:32.473 --> 02:47:35.636]  Homeland Security had a C-SPAN party when Governor Ridge was in.
[02:47:35.936 --> 02:47:38.058]  Praising Jack Bauer as their mascot.
[02:47:38.518 --> 02:47:39.819]  Totally sick!
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:42.502]  Frank in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:47:45.754 --> 02:47:47.195]  You guys bring up Frank in New York, please?
[02:47:47.735 --> 02:47:47.996]  Thanks.
[02:47:48.396 --> 02:47:49.136]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:47:49.396 --> 02:47:50.237]  Happy New Year.
[02:47:50.257 --> 02:47:55.621]  Yeah, you've done a tremendous job alerting people to the dangers of this.
[02:47:55.741 --> 02:48:03.486]  What I think is going to have to be done, Alex, is people are going to have to charge the people operating the machines with
[02:48:04.408 --> 02:48:06.210]  Uh, you know, creating pornography.
[02:48:06.730 --> 02:48:17.557]  And they're going to have to, uh... Well, they're going to claim federal immunity, but they don't have immunity because they do it in this federal power grab on the airport reservations that are now metastasizing out.
[02:48:18.118 --> 02:48:25.062]  But the point is, people are going to have to bring the cases before the court, and also, they're going to have to... You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[02:48:25.082 --> 02:48:25.543]  Sorry, Alex, go ahead.
[02:48:26.043 --> 02:48:28.004]  No, no, you can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[02:48:28.044 --> 02:48:28.585]  I agree with you.
[02:48:29.173 --> 02:48:31.394]  And this is an important issue, too.
[02:48:31.955 --> 02:48:38.659]  This is really an unlawful search and seizure, because there's no probable cause.
[02:48:39.319 --> 02:48:58.011]  Ultimately, that is what has to be brought in the lawsuit, and also the fact that the insiders, in violation of laws that were passed in the 1970s, have a conflict of interest in the government with their private investments that are not put in blind trust.
[02:48:58.704 --> 02:49:02.447]  And the law has to come down on them using RICO to do that.
[02:49:02.708 --> 02:49:14.798]  And it means everyone from George Bush's father, former President Bush 41, Bill Clinton, numerous senators, and the neocons that were in, you know, both administrations.
[02:49:14.938 --> 02:49:15.519]  I agree with you.
[02:49:15.559 --> 02:49:15.839]  Great points.
[02:49:15.859 --> 02:49:18.021]  All of those have to be... Great point, Frank.
[02:49:18.061 --> 02:49:19.142]  I appreciate your call.
[02:49:19.782 --> 02:49:21.204]  Eric in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[02:49:22.694 --> 02:49:24.275]  Hello, Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:49:24.315 --> 02:49:25.656]  Pleasure to speak to you once again.
[02:49:25.676 --> 02:49:26.296]  Welcome.
[02:49:27.137 --> 02:49:29.058]  Alright, so I have a solution here.
[02:49:29.318 --> 02:49:40.045]  If I was Alex Jones, what I would do is I would put a downloadable MP3 file on my website, like InfoWars.com, along with the flyer.
[02:49:40.085 --> 02:49:45.189]  The flyer can have pictures of, like, the woman getting her body scanned, the naked picture.
[02:49:45.209 --> 02:49:47.030]  I would put the naked picture right on the flyer.
[02:49:47.726 --> 02:49:48.386]  Yeah.
[02:49:48.847 --> 02:49:50.808]  And then, uh, you can have 78 minutes of audio on an mp3.
[02:50:04.966 --> 02:50:15.156]  You know, Alex, I don't understand why you don't have any MP3 files on your website, because what I do is I record... Sir, we do have MP3 files, or at least we had them up there.
[02:50:15.177 --> 02:50:17.419]  I mean, we post that too, don't we?
[02:50:19.261 --> 02:50:24.086]  We have MP3 files on the site and the listen page, sir, and right underneath the player on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:24.386 --> 02:50:26.008]  You can't download that onto a CD.
[02:50:27.779 --> 02:50:28.940]  Well, I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:30.420]  We try to make it as easy as we can.
[02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:31.081]  Send it to us.
[02:50:31.441 --> 02:50:33.182]  I have thought about my boycott plan.
[02:50:33.442 --> 02:50:35.103]  Having another flyer contest.
[02:50:35.623 --> 02:50:37.884]  That is a small part of my overall operation.
[02:50:38.224 --> 02:50:40.125]  I like to give folks lots of different ideas to take action.
[02:50:40.145 --> 02:50:40.906]  Great points, Eric.
[02:50:40.926 --> 02:50:41.506]  I appreciate it.
[02:50:41.786 --> 02:50:42.006]  Hey!
[02:50:42.466 --> 02:50:43.767]  We're trying to get more employees.
[02:50:43.787 --> 02:50:44.908]  We're trying to do a better job.
[02:50:45.088 --> 02:50:46.709]  I'm not the only one here fighting this.
[02:50:47.529 --> 02:50:55.672]  We're going to post this on YouTube, PrisonPlanet.TV, spread these files out to everyone, but instead it's a complaint about how I'm not doing enough.
[02:50:55.792 --> 02:50:56.312]  I'm sorry.
[02:50:56.632 --> 02:50:57.032]  I'm bad.
[02:50:57.312 --> 02:50:57.713]  I'm bad.
[02:50:58.073 --> 02:50:58.473]  I'm bad.
[02:51:00.013 --> 02:51:03.275]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[02:51:03.595 --> 02:51:09.837]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[02:51:10.057 --> 02:51:10.317]  Why?
[02:51:10.537 --> 02:51:12.378]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[02:51:12.558 --> 02:51:15.579]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[02:51:15.859 --> 02:51:20.063]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[02:51:20.283 --> 02:51:23.726]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[02:51:23.946 --> 02:51:29.531]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[02:51:29.692 --> 02:51:36.658]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers, business promotions,
[02:51:36.778 --> 02:51:37.158]  We're good.
[02:52:01.121 --> 02:52:04.789]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:05.130 --> 02:52:08.156]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:08.397 --> 02:52:09.819]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:10.501 --> 02:52:13.162]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:13.182 --> 02:52:19.384]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:19.564 --> 02:52:24.606]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:24.766 --> 02:52:27.907]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:28.028 --> 02:52:34.750]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:36.971]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:37.212 --> 02:52:38.553]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:38.793 --> 02:52:41.074]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:41.254 --> 02:52:43.096]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:43.116 --> 02:52:48.199]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:48.539 --> 02:52:53.322]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:53.523 --> 02:52:57.645]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.792 --> 02:53:02.913]  This is not a drill.
[02:53:03.013 --> 02:53:04.994]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:53:05.514 --> 02:53:07.135]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:53:07.415 --> 02:53:14.539]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:53:14.639 --> 02:53:18.981]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:53:19.021 --> 02:53:21.583]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[02:53:21.663 --> 02:53:24.424]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[02:53:24.464 --> 02:53:25.625]  How to create the perfect
[02:53:25.745 --> 02:53:26.045]  I think so.
[02:53:49.162 --> 02:53:49.903]  We will continue...
[02:54:05.660 --> 02:54:08.583]  With the big issue, what comes after the naked body scanners?
[02:54:08.823 --> 02:54:09.283]  Well, we know.
[02:54:09.323 --> 02:54:12.306]  Implantable microchips, shot bracelets, all of it.
[02:54:12.826 --> 02:54:14.367]  We'll continue tomorrow discussing this.
[02:54:14.928 --> 02:54:16.709]  We have, what, Alan Watt coming up tomorrow?
[02:54:17.390 --> 02:54:19.232]  A bunch of other very informative guests.
[02:54:19.592 --> 02:54:22.655]  I want to jam in a few final calls from Mark, Aaron, Nathan, and Doug if we can.
[02:54:22.675 --> 02:54:25.177]  We'll continue tomorrow with listeners about your ideas.
[02:54:25.537 --> 02:54:29.781]  Let that percolate, marinate about how we boycott, how we take action.
[02:54:29.821 --> 02:54:30.962]  We're developing this program.
[02:54:31.002 --> 02:54:32.083]  First, we warn the public.
[02:54:33.211 --> 02:54:35.152]  About just how serious these body scanners are.
[02:54:35.512 --> 02:54:38.914]  Before I take a few final calls, I want to let you know about some sponsors who made today's show possible.
[02:54:39.314 --> 02:54:40.895]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:54:41.535 --> 02:54:43.276]  Everybody needs to get back to the land.
[02:54:43.296 --> 02:54:44.577]  The globalists want us off the land.
[02:54:44.637 --> 02:54:46.938]  Even if you have a little backyard, you can grow an incredible garden.
[02:54:47.378 --> 02:54:52.781]  The Survival Seed Bank has non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds of a wide variety and super high quality of great value.
[02:54:53.061 --> 02:54:55.142]  SurvivalSeedBank.com is the website.
[02:54:55.342 --> 02:54:58.864]  www.SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:55:02.526 --> 02:55:04.128]  Plus, gardening is just so much fun.
[02:55:04.148 --> 02:55:04.969]  Your children will love it.
[02:55:04.990 --> 02:55:06.692]  We need to start getting back to our humanity.
[02:55:07.233 --> 02:55:09.275]  Plus, it's good to store a few of these or give them as gifts.
[02:55:09.556 --> 02:55:11.679]  SurvivalSeedBank.com, 877-327-0365 or SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:55:11.919 --> 02:55:12.600]  Take action today.
[02:55:19.051 --> 02:55:20.592]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:55:20.672 --> 02:55:26.877]  If some of you just want to bug out or look into places in Central or South America, down in South America, Ecuador, a lot of people I know are moving there.
[02:55:26.898 --> 02:55:31.601]  EcuadorCentral.com believes we all have a duty to protect our families and our wealth.
[02:55:32.002 --> 02:55:38.427]  If you're considering a new life somewhere else, want a second home outside the U.S., or if you want to invest in a growing economy, EcuadorCentral.com can help you.
[02:55:38.567 --> 02:55:38.847]  Yes, Alex.
[02:55:38.867 --> 02:55:39.428]  Great work, great work.
[02:55:39.448 --> 02:55:39.568]  Listen,
[02:56:03.021 --> 02:56:06.064]  For the evildoers behind all of this, it's not about the money.
[02:56:06.124 --> 02:56:07.345]  They own the printing press.
[02:56:07.705 --> 02:56:13.730]  But for everybody in between you and I... It's about the power making us submit and making other people do evil things for money.
[02:56:13.770 --> 02:56:14.110]  Go ahead.
[02:56:14.871 --> 02:56:22.377]  So they will use, being that they have unlimited resources with the printing press, they will use money to control the rest of us.
[02:56:22.577 --> 02:56:30.184]  I say we call everybody, every company that's involved in the travel business, the airlines, the airports, resorts,
[02:56:30.734 --> 02:56:39.923]  Carnival Cruise Lines, all these companies, call them, call them, call them, and tell them you're not going to fly, you're not going to come and see them, you're not going to do business with them, because it's ridiculous.
[02:56:40.243 --> 02:56:55.417]  And stay angry, and when you go through the airport and they try to put you in it, say absolutely not, record it with your iPhone like the Ron Paul supporter did, to show how they abuse you, they'll lie about you, you'll catch them in lies, and do not let them put you through the scanner.
[02:56:56.380 --> 02:56:57.321]  That's exactly right.
[02:56:57.481 --> 02:57:01.604]  In 2005, I got a ticket from the TSA for a bunch of crazy baloney.
[02:57:02.305 --> 02:57:03.646]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:57:03.986 --> 02:57:07.629]  This is an assault on our privacy.
[02:57:07.649 --> 02:57:14.915]  They're now charging people for tweezers and small scissors in women's makeup bags with felonies.
[02:57:14.935 --> 02:57:15.515]  They hate us.
[02:57:15.575 --> 02:57:16.156]  They want us.
[02:57:16.376 --> 02:57:17.537]  They want to put us in prison.
[02:57:17.557 --> 02:57:18.638]  They want to make us slaves.
[02:57:18.898 --> 02:57:20.519]  So how do tyrants make people slaves?
[02:57:20.779 --> 02:57:22.681]  They pass laws to make everyone criminal.
[02:57:24.172 --> 02:57:25.713]  It's all about control, Alex.
[02:57:25.773 --> 02:57:27.214]  It's control, control, control.
[02:57:27.234 --> 02:57:28.114]  They want to control us.
[02:57:28.154 --> 02:57:32.497]  They want us to reel us in, rein us in, to be a part of their control system.
[02:57:32.777 --> 02:57:33.277]  And that's it.
[02:57:33.357 --> 02:57:34.718]  And I'm not participating.
[02:57:34.738 --> 02:57:35.658]  I don't know about the rest of you.
[02:57:35.779 --> 02:57:36.999]  I am not participating.
[02:57:37.059 --> 02:57:38.340]  I am calling these people now.
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:40.041]  When I get off the phone here, I'm making calls.
[02:57:40.081 --> 02:57:41.522]  You got me inspired again, Alex.
[02:57:41.542 --> 02:57:41.962]  Thank you.
[02:57:42.482 --> 02:57:42.822]  Thank you.
[02:57:42.862 --> 02:57:43.883]  God bless you, Mark.
[02:57:43.903 --> 02:57:45.224]  Aaron in Canada.
[02:57:45.244 --> 02:57:45.884]  You're on the air.
[02:57:45.944 --> 02:57:47.125]  Same stuff going on in Canada.
[02:57:47.145 --> 02:57:47.545]  Go ahead.
[02:57:47.565 --> 02:57:50.887]  Aaron.
[02:57:51.889 --> 02:58:00.891]  Hey Alex, I just want to point out, I think there's a big opportunity to make a global statement here with the Olympics coming up in Vancouver.
[02:58:01.271 --> 02:58:01.871]  Boycott them!
[02:58:03.491 --> 02:58:13.313]  Well, yeah, I mean the world stage is going to be on Vancouver mid-February, so I think there's a big opportunity there to put something together.
[02:58:13.474 --> 02:58:20.235]  And that's why they're saying no signs allowed even in the streets of the city, no free speech, your own media is calling it martial law.
[02:58:21.294 --> 02:58:22.635]  Well, it is good that you stayed here.
[02:58:23.915 --> 02:58:26.676]  Everybody needs to be out there with flyers, banners, you name it.
[02:58:26.996 --> 02:58:29.517]  We have got to make a big deal out of the body scanners.
[02:58:29.797 --> 02:58:31.718]  However we can get publicity to expose it.
[02:58:32.098 --> 02:58:32.798]  Great point.
[02:58:33.198 --> 02:58:35.019]  It films your entire naked body.
[02:58:35.099 --> 02:58:37.600]  Mainstream media admits it's child pornography.
[02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:38.400]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:39.681]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:58:39.721 --> 02:58:43.102]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
