[00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:13.373]  Okay, coming up at the bottom of the next hour, we're going to get into what's happening with the economy, Obama's Supreme Court picks, he's looking at Napolitano of Homeland Security and others.
[00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:22.979]  We're also going to get into provocateurs openly announce plans to stage Tea Party violence to demonize the Tea Parties and claim that they're violent.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.145]  We have a full court press claiming that I'm calling for violence on every major news channel out there, Southern Poverty Law Center, you name it.
[00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:33.386]  Why is that happening?
[00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:35.527]  But until the bottom of the hour, Lt.
[00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:35.827]  Col.
[00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:38.588]  Anthony Schaefer joins us via video Skype from Ireland.
[00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:39.469]  Lt.
[00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:39.689]  Col.
[00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:47.712]  Anthony Schaefer is a Bronze Star recipient with more than 25 years of experience in the intelligence community, including directing the Defense Intelligence Agency Task Force Stratus IV.
[00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:59.898]  Under his lead, Stratus IV conducted some of the most daring and innovative human intelligence collection and information operation ever undertaken by the Department of Defense, as well as providing information to support the SOCOM program AbleDanger.
[00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:08.786]  And currently he is a senior fellow at the External Communications Director of Special Lecturer at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington, D.C.
[00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:17.875]  He instructs classes in psychology of terrorism and intelligence analysts, and he's also a contributor to many mainstream television programs out there.
[00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:19.256]  Good to have you on.
[00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:25.222]  Now, Colonel Schaffer, can you tell us why you're in Ireland, or is that classified?
[00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:27.735]  No, it's just vacation.
[00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:33.536]  Getting a few days away before the build-up for the book is probably the best way of describing what I'm doing.
[00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:40.778]  Well, you're nice to spend time with us on your vacation there on the Emerald Isle.
[00:01:40.978 --> 00:01:52.062]  Let's start off, there's a lot of subjects to cover with the WikiLeaks video coming out last week with the video of the Apaches and the kids in the van and the Reuters reporter.
[00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:53.022]  Right.
[00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:55.396]  Well, what do you want?
[00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:58.919]  You want me to talk about my assessment of it, or do you want to talk about your assessment of it?
[00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.200]  Your assessment of it.
[00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:13.113]  Well, first off, I think that the fact that there was a FOIA in on that video by Reuters, and the Army had resisted releasing it, that was indicative, I think, of what was on the video.
[00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.375]  I don't think people really want to have it out there.
[00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:18.058]  As I understand it now, the video's been confirmed as authentic.
[00:02:18.698 --> 00:02:19.939]  And that's the second problem with it.
[00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.062]  I think that it's not so much a problem that the Weekly Leaks folks got it.
[00:02:24.162 --> 00:02:29.546]  I think it's a fact that the Army didn't stand up at the time this happened and said, hey, some mistakes were made here.
[00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:31.288]  And let me be clear on why I'm saying that.
[00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:35.291]  And I'm going to say this clearly as an academic, not as an Army Reserve officer.
[00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:36.792]  I'm saying this clearly as an academic.
[00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:41.476]  There are, from my background and experience from having been in combat,
[00:02:42.156 --> 00:02:55.385]  My understanding of the rules of warfare, especially in this case, the ROE, the specific rules of engagement for this specific period, which I understand are essentially the ones you can find on the internet.
[00:02:55.425 --> 00:03:00.648]  The 2006 rules of engagement are still valid for the most part, and this incident occurred in 2007.
[00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:09.414]  Based on those two factors plus the video, what is seen on the video, there are two clear rules of engagement violations
[00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:10.815]  That I can see.
[00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:17.402]  First, the first clear violation comes right after the attack begins.
[00:03:18.043 --> 00:03:21.047]  And I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the Apache drivers here.
[00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:29.036]  I mean Alex, there's a lot of things going on and I've been told by both former Bush White House executives and folks who were in Iraq.
[00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:34.102]  There are things happening before and after that video regarding combat operations.
[00:03:34.843 --> 00:03:37.827]  Essentially the fog of warfare, the heat of battle, whatever you want to call it.
[00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:44.617]  Yeah, later in the full video they do find some guys with guns going in a building and they fire a Hellfire missile into it.
[00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:53.265]  Well, and I've got to say, I've not seen that part of the video, but I'm just trying to make sure that people understand that there were things going on before and after this video.
[00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:59.147]  So there was essentially an adrenaline rush going on, and I think everybody who was there on the scene.
[00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:01.087]  So you can't discount that I've been there.
[00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:03.907]  I understand the fact that you get so focused on what's going on.
[00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:08.608]  It's hard to take a step back and look hard at what's going on.
[00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:11.709]  So giving the benefit of the doubt, Alex, to the Apache drivers,
[00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.733]  They misidentified the Reuters journalists with their cameras.
[00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:22.717]  So that's the first mistake, and I think that's forgivable by the fact that it was the heat of battle.
[00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:24.839]  All right, Colonel Schaefer, we got a break.
[00:04:24.859 --> 00:04:26.640]  We're back in one minute with the next hour.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.701]  We'll be with us for 30 minutes.
[00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:31.404]  We'll continue where you left off at that point.
[00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:33.086]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.508]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:37.289]  Back in one minute.
[00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:41.693]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:04:43.712 --> 00:04:45.919]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:51.388]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.753]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:04:57.114 --> 00:04:58.855]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:03.980]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.121]  How much do you want?
[00:05:05.361 --> 00:05:06.102]  When do you want it?
[00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:08.083]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:08.364 --> 00:05:09.184]  When will you need it?
[00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:11.506]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:12.748]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:14.269]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:19.551]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.933]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:26.834]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:27.154 --> 00:05:28.135]  How much will you need?
[00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:29.015]  We don't know.
[00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.196]  How much do you want?
[00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:31.136]  All you can get.
[00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:32.157]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:35.098]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:37.579]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:43.941]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.582]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:52.224]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:06:02.941 --> 00:06:03.602]  Big Brother.
[00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:05.304]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:07.147]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:08.609]  You want answers?
[00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.311]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:10.932 --> 00:06:14.537]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:15.118 --> 00:06:19.203]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:06:22.901 --> 00:06:26.924]  Well, a lot of the footage is comparable to video games.
[00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:28.605]  But this isn't a video game.
[00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:29.586]  This is life and death.
[00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:35.030]  And some said, well, hey, these people were in a war zone, these Reuters reporters, this van full of kids.
[00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.052]  You know, that's their problem.
[00:06:38.072 --> 00:06:43.356]  But the war zone is a urban built-up area in a major city in Iraq.
[00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:49.980]  And the Pentagon blocked this being released, and this is the type of stuff that happens in war, in modern war.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.762]  So then you have to ask, is this then a just war?
[00:06:53.302 --> 00:06:59.486]  And before you go invade a country, and knowing there's going to be this type of collateral damage, you better make sure your nation is under threat.
[00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:06.571]  We know they lied about WMDs and everything else, but Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, goes by Tony Schaefer, is our guest.
[00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:07.952]  Very nice to be joining us.
[00:07:07.972 --> 00:07:09.153]  You got cut off by the break.
[00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:10.794]  This is a short segment as well.
[00:07:11.394 --> 00:07:13.516]  Continue with the points you were making.
[00:07:14.356 --> 00:07:17.918]  I agree with your point on the whole justification of the war thing, Alex.
[00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.018]  You and I have talked about it a little bit.
[00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:24.161]  I think, frankly, you and I have talked about this, and I'll say it for the benefit of your listeners.
[00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:28.203]  I think there's other ways we could have taken care of Iraq without a full-blown invasion.
[00:07:28.243 --> 00:07:30.084]  With that said, though, I think that's a topic for another day.
[00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:45.579]  Back to this specific video, giving the benefit of the doubt to the Apache drivers in the heat of the moment, I think there could have been justification regarding the misidentification of the bags as either weapons or RPGs, maybe.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.442]  I'm pretty dubious, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
[00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:54.208]  The mistakes I saw, which were the clear violations, Alex, were first off, right after they got clearance to fire.
[00:07:54.808 --> 00:08:00.493]  Once they fired, they should have essentially stopped then and paused and tried to figure out what was going on.
[00:08:00.993 --> 00:08:06.598]  And one of the things, one of the clear rules that were broken is it says once someone is down, you quit shooting.
[00:08:06.938 --> 00:08:09.160]  They didn't quit shooting, they made sure these guys were dead.
[00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:12.063]  Now as an intelligence officer, I said this on the air, that's stupid.
[00:08:12.643 --> 00:08:17.290]  As an intelligence officer, you want to capture people to find out what their affiliation is, why they were doing what they were doing.
[00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.673]  Clearly, this was not good common sense.
[00:08:19.693 --> 00:08:28.565]  This is not something... and frankly, if I were the commander and I saw this on the battlefield, I would have stopped those soldiers right there and either... and done something, because that's not the way you should conduct yourself.
[00:08:29.386 --> 00:08:30.807]  Now, let's fast forward to the ban.
[00:08:30.827 --> 00:08:40.911]  And this is something I think has become a very big point of contention, which I frankly think is a huge mistake both for the PR war and another clear violation of the rules of engagement.
[00:08:41.452 --> 00:08:47.955]  When the Reuters reporter was on the ground crawling away, they were waiting, they were trying to egg him on, hoping he'd pick up a weapon.
[00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:55.198]  As I said before, once a person's down, you're obligated to go in there and render aid and try to capture them and find out what's going on.
[00:08:55.858 --> 00:09:02.304]  When the van shows up to give him aid, and Alex, I've watched the video at least three times to make sure I understood it correctly.
[00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:13.034]  First off, if you look at the video carefully, you see people are in the van, and there is no indication from the van at any point in time that it was a threat.
[00:09:13.394 --> 00:09:19.400]  And this is where it clearly states that you have to have a clearly defined threat before you fire and use deadly force.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.861]  In this case, it was very clear there was no threat from that van.
[00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:26.862]  That van was there to render aid for that individual.
[00:09:27.362 --> 00:09:28.682]  Now, there's reports out on this.
[00:09:28.722 --> 00:09:30.103]  I'm not sure if you found copies yet or not.
[00:09:30.123 --> 00:09:31.263]  I've been able to read the reports.
[00:09:31.303 --> 00:09:32.203]  I don't have a copy of them.
[00:09:32.783 --> 00:09:44.186]  Something called AR-15-6, Army Regulation 15-6 Investigative Reports, which are essentially a fact-finding investigation directed by the commander to go through and assess what happened.
[00:09:44.446 --> 00:09:46.247]  Within the reports relating to this incident,
[00:09:46.767 --> 00:09:53.430]  It talks about the fact that there were vehicles out that day, four-door sedans, running weapons to insurgents.
[00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:56.272]  Well, it's very clear from the video that that was not a four-door sedan.
[00:09:56.312 --> 00:09:57.032]  It was fired on.
[00:09:57.092 --> 00:10:01.795]  So, apparently in the investigation, they tried to say, well, we misidentified the van.
[00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.118]  I don't think that's possible.
[00:10:04.158 --> 00:10:07.283]  I think the ban is very clearly identified as a ban, not as a four-door sedan.
[00:10:07.844 --> 00:10:16.016]  So, in my professional judgment, both on my experience in Afghanistan, having been in urban warfare, having to make no-shoot decisions,
[00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:23.122]  And on the rules of engagement, the two clear violations were continuing to fire once the individuals were down.
[00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:28.445]  And of course, firing on the van when there was no hostile threat indicated, as a matter of fact, it was the contrary.
[00:10:28.825 --> 00:10:33.688]  It indicated, for the most part, that those people were trying to render aid to that individual.
[00:10:33.768 --> 00:10:40.212]  Which, again, as an intelligence officer, they could have monitored that van, they could have followed it, and as you see in the video,
[00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:40.853]  U.S.
[00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:44.379]  forces show up within minutes of the incident to secure the area.
[00:10:44.739 --> 00:10:46.002]  Colonel Schaefer, stay there.
[00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:47.244]  Long segment coming up.
[00:10:47.264 --> 00:10:51.551]  Let's get your conclusion on this and then talk about the nature of modern warfare.
[00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:52.052]  Period.
[00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:52.853]  Straight ahead.
[00:10:58.203 --> 00:10:59.465]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:04.851]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:09.717]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:11:10.118 --> 00:11:10.518]  It's true.
[00:11:10.598 --> 00:11:15.164]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:20.387]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:11:20.908 --> 00:11:22.829]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:27.832]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:11:28.032 --> 00:11:28.933]  And here's the best part.
[00:11:29.153 --> 00:11:31.915]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:11:32.215 --> 00:11:35.517]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:11:35.838 --> 00:11:38.680]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.921]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:42.182]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:49.512]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:11:50.053 --> 00:11:54.562]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:11:54.883 --> 00:11:57.267]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:03.342]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:11.825]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:16.586]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:12:17.166 --> 00:12:27.990]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:37.632]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:43.193]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[00:13:01.784 --> 00:13:02.704]  Tyranny is here.
[00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:06.766]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:09.227]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:14.670]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:21.313]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:27.314]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:13:27.734 --> 00:13:31.415]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:35.896]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:13:36.196 --> 00:13:41.697]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:13:42.138 --> 00:13:45.038]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:13:45.698 --> 00:13:47.139]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:48.099]  It's here.

[00:14:03.624 --> 00:14:04.265]  Big Brother.
[00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:05.967]  Mainstream media.
[00:14:06.707 --> 00:14:07.849]  Government cover-ups.
[00:14:08.469 --> 00:14:09.290]  You want answers?
[00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:10.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:14:11.593 --> 00:14:15.237]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:15.797 --> 00:14:19.842]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:14:20.602 --> 00:14:28.493]  Well, our trusted Bilderberg sleuth, Jim Tucker, has discovered and confirmed the city it is to be in in Spain.
[00:14:28.513 --> 00:14:31.578]  He'll be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:14:31.598 --> 00:14:36.945]  For the next 25 minutes, Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer is our guest.
[00:14:37.546 --> 00:14:41.947]  And you can check out the website c4ads.org.
[00:14:42.027 --> 00:14:53.071]  He's got a new book coming out very soon that's going to have a lot of new revealing information about how the army was stopped from killing bin Laden and other senior leadership of al-Qaeda in the months and weeks before 9-11.
[00:14:54.798 --> 00:15:01.405]  Of course, when he tried to testify in closed session to Congress about this, he later got persecuted for it, but that was proven to be a fraud.
[00:15:01.986 --> 00:15:03.047]  And so he's with us today.
[00:15:03.787 --> 00:15:08.372]  Look, Colonel, they can say that this is the rules of war.
[00:15:08.452 --> 00:15:09.273]  People get killed.
[00:15:09.313 --> 00:15:10.174]  It's a war zone.
[00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:12.377]  You talk about adrenaline.
[00:15:12.417 --> 00:15:13.698]  It's something more than that.
[00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:18.163]  Because I've seen old gun pod footage of fighter pilots in Vietnam.
[00:15:18.203 --> 00:15:22.388]  They weren't giggling and snickering and this bloodlust.
[00:15:22.408 --> 00:15:24.470]  And we see footage of some of the troops.
[00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:29.236]  It's a minority getting off on shooting dogs or throwing dogs off cliffs.
[00:15:29.276 --> 00:15:30.758]  They've two, three, four tours.
[00:15:31.258 --> 00:15:31.418]  Right.
[00:15:31.438 --> 00:15:31.558]  Right.
[00:15:31.578 --> 00:15:31.839]  Right.
[00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:05.023]  The helicopter pilot and the gunner say, ah, shouldn't be in a war zone.
[00:16:06.105 --> 00:16:12.633]  So we see not just the people on the ground being dehumanized, but we see the people in the helicopters being dehumanized.
[00:16:13.652 --> 00:16:23.058]  Well, I agree with you, and this is one of those things where, again, if I were the commander and I witnessed that, those soldiers would have been relieved on the spot because, like I said, that is exactly the point.
[00:16:23.638 --> 00:16:28.642]  All combat, especially the people I've been in combat with, do not conduct themselves in that manner.
[00:16:29.442 --> 00:16:35.246]  Anytime you have to take a life, you need to be reverent in the fact that you are doing it.
[00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:41.431]  And, as you mentioned in my book, The Dark Side of the Force is coming out later this year, last day of August.
[00:16:42.232 --> 00:16:57.486]  And, you know, one of the first incidents in that book I talk about, my first combat convoy, I have to make a choice about shooting or not shooting an eight-year-old kid who throws a Sun Juice empty box in front of the vehicle in front of me.
[00:16:57.506 --> 00:17:01.650]  And I would have been right to shoot the kid by the rules of engagement, but I didn't.
[00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.911]  And this is one of those things that was a win-win for the Taliban.
[00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:09.573]  If I shot the kid, that's good because, you know, we shot a kid and that's a score for them.
[00:17:09.933 --> 00:17:15.095]  And if I didn't shoot him, that makes me less likely to shoot a kid next time if he does have a bomb in his hand.
[00:17:15.135 --> 00:17:17.296]  So this is the nature of modern warfare.
[00:17:17.576 --> 00:17:21.158]  It's one of those things where there's no right answers, but if you pick the right
[00:17:21.758 --> 00:17:24.319]  If you pick the wrong answer, it's going to be hurtful no matter what.
[00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:25.719]  And let's not kid ourselves.
[00:17:26.139 --> 00:17:28.040]  This is a war of images.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.140]  A war of information.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.861]  And you know, you have InfoWars.com.
[00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:36.442]  That is a brilliant way of displaying information relating to what is really going on.
[00:17:36.982 --> 00:17:40.263]  This is one of those things, Alex, we have to be better than the adversary.
[00:17:40.803 --> 00:17:54.593]  If you recall, the Taliban came out with a 29-point code of conduct last year done by al-Baghdadar, who was actually wrapped up recently because he became too pro-negotiating for his own good with the Pakistanis.
[00:17:56.394 --> 00:18:05.080]  We will never see the Taliban actually execute their operations in conjunction with that 69 point code of conduct.
[00:18:05.441 --> 00:18:06.721]  This is where we're better than they are.
[00:18:06.822 --> 00:18:09.123]  And frankly, this is one of the points I'd like to say.
[00:18:09.143 --> 00:18:14.787]  I'm not speaking for the Army, but the Army and the DOD is actually going to relook this now because it's the right thing to do.
[00:18:15.147 --> 00:18:19.911]  We need to look at the circumstance of why was it the soldiers were so apt to shoot that day?
[00:18:20.231 --> 00:18:23.773]  Clearly, it's not only a training issue, it's a psychological issue.
[00:18:24.093 --> 00:18:29.416]  And let's not forget, Alex, that we have record number of suicides from post-traumatic stress.
[00:18:30.156 --> 00:18:34.198]  I think this is why you're seeing such a great number of post-traumatic stress issues.
[00:18:34.578 --> 00:18:37.460]  Because people are not doing the right thing, necessarily.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.142]  Commanders are obligated to train and equip their soldiers to win.
[00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.763]  But then also, they're responsible for holding them back.
[00:18:44.863 --> 00:18:45.824]  Because, as you point out,
[00:18:46.364 --> 00:18:48.406]  Through our history, we have been better than this.
[00:18:49.006 --> 00:18:51.188]  We're obligated to try to pull people back.
[00:18:51.668 --> 00:18:52.709]  We also had Vietnam.
[00:18:52.749 --> 00:18:55.331]  We had the Malay Massacre.
[00:18:55.751 --> 00:18:58.833]  So we have had a record of people going off the reservation.
[00:18:59.194 --> 00:19:07.680]  I'd like to believe that's an exception, but we've got to be better about the way we conduct modern warfare because things like this do matter, and it shapes the Al-Qaeda battle space.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.383]  This video will help Al-Qaeda recruit, and we both know that.
[00:19:12.165 --> 00:19:13.747]  Okay, let's expand on this though.
[00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:23.640]  Take a movie like Apocalypse Now with Colonel Kurtz, who's gone completely insane, and so the military sends out a special operator to kill him.
[00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:37.509]  But now I read John Yoo memos, I read Alberto Gonzalez memos, guys that have never been in the military, never been in combat, and they're saying we can crush children's genitals, we can torture children.
[00:19:37.889 --> 00:19:39.370]  The military's given this.
[00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:45.412]  The Pentagon hires jail guards and people who've been fired from federal jails for abuse.
[00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:51.215]  General Togumbo's own report says raping children, raping people with acid.
[00:19:51.275 --> 00:19:52.516]  I mean, this is in the Army report.
[00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:54.077]  Far worse than those images.
[00:19:54.537 --> 00:20:09.907]  Why on earth would the Pentagon accept directives from the Bush White House knowing that once this was implemented, this would absolutely destroy morale and turn us into the Nazis in the eyes of the world?
[00:20:10.902 --> 00:20:12.102]  Well, I think that's the answer.
[00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:15.204]  The answer to your question is within your question.
[00:20:16.124 --> 00:20:19.925]  I think a lot of those policies were established for retribution more than actual intelligence collection.
[00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:25.007]  The Army put out a policy a few years ago saying we will follow a very strict regimen of
[00:20:27.188 --> 00:20:31.731]  Basically, techniques, non-intrusive, non-violent techniques to break people.
[00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:40.535]  Again, I cited in my book, there's two chapters about an FBI special agent and I working to interrogate and break.
[00:20:40.655 --> 00:20:43.497]  I mean, we didn't touch him once, but within three days we were able to break him.
[00:20:44.357 --> 00:20:48.340]  By use of really good investigative and interrogation techniques.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.023]  And I think, based on my experience, you can get people to talk.
[00:20:53.123 --> 00:20:54.324]  You don't have to touch them.
[00:20:54.364 --> 00:20:55.685]  You don't have to torture them.
[00:20:56.225 --> 00:21:04.031]  But a lot of times, as you know, their mind becomes their own worst enemy because of the imagery of their own fears.
[00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:06.432]  You can touch on people's fears without touching them.
[00:21:06.852 --> 00:21:07.933]  And that's the idea here.
[00:21:07.953 --> 00:21:11.936]  We need to be better and more instructive in how we have people do that.
[00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:13.517]  Take Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[00:21:13.597 --> 00:21:16.159]  He confessed after 100 plus water boardings.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.861]  They finally threatened his family.
[00:21:17.881 --> 00:21:21.183]  They finally said something bad is going to happen to your kids and wife if you don't.
[00:21:21.484 --> 00:21:26.288]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built until four years after he was arrested.
[00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:30.731]  He almost confessed to sinking the Titanic or killing Kennedy.
[00:21:30.751 --> 00:21:32.233]  I mean this is ridiculous.
[00:21:33.103 --> 00:21:38.848]  Well, I think this brings up an excellent problem for the prosecutions we're now going to face for the 9-11 terrorists.
[00:21:39.249 --> 00:21:41.791]  I mean, I'm sorry, the detainees at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:47.356]  Which is similar to anybody who has something to do with 9-11 regarding the techniques you just mentioned.
[00:21:48.497 --> 00:21:51.480]  Anytime you torture someone, Alex, the fact is this.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.943]  They're going to tell you whatever you want to know to make the pain stop.
[00:21:55.463 --> 00:21:56.925]  And that's been proven over and over again.
[00:21:57.265 --> 00:22:00.987]  So again, it's one of those things where I think there are some other very vast techniques.
[00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:09.652]  One of the 9-11 conspirators were broken by very complex techniques relating to the fact that he was a pedophile.
[00:22:10.232 --> 00:22:15.215]  So, in this one instance, they used the idea that his personal conduct
[00:22:15.735 --> 00:22:22.139]  Was directly in contrast and contradiction to his personal beliefs relating to Allah and his faith.
[00:22:22.499 --> 00:22:32.906]  So enough of hitting him on that, not hitting him literally, but hitting him with the idea of the disconnect between his personal conduct and his personal beliefs is what broke him eventually.
[00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:34.346]  And this is the idea.
[00:22:34.406 --> 00:22:38.767]  You need to get inside these people's heads, these individuals' heads, and break them without touching them.
[00:22:39.187 --> 00:22:46.428]  So, when you look at the interrogation program, I personally turned down a seat in that program.
[00:22:46.468 --> 00:22:53.149]  I talk about that a little bit in my book, about being given a tour of one of the secret prisons and then saying, you know, being asked, what do you think?
[00:22:53.169 --> 00:22:57.510]  It's like, look, I basically said just to read ahead in the book here, I want nothing to do with this.
[00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.611]  And, frankly, that's the problem.
[00:23:01.111 --> 00:23:02.151]  I think when you have
[00:23:03.231 --> 00:23:07.872]  A policy set up by an administration, Alex, the Army or the military is obligated to follow it.
[00:23:08.373 --> 00:23:15.155]  And that's one of those things where you have lawyers, hopefully lawyers who are smart enough to understand that you can't arbitrarily decide to start breaking U.S.
[00:23:15.195 --> 00:23:15.455]  laws.
[00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:23.317]  And I frankly read the memos done by the Bush White House lawyers as being illegal, approving illegal activities.
[00:23:23.937 --> 00:23:29.841]  Which, frankly, you know, we as soldiers are obligated to try to resist illegal orders.
[00:23:30.502 --> 00:23:32.043]  And you were told that in your training.
[00:23:32.123 --> 00:23:35.385]  It is your obligation to not follow illegal orders.
[00:23:35.745 --> 00:23:47.954]  It becomes a very fine line between following orders which are given by lawful authority, which we're trained to do, or trying to find a way to not follow or disabuse yourself of illegal orders.
[00:23:48.194 --> 00:23:52.898]  Well, I mean, you just talked about it being illegal, and clearly it is illegal on the face of it, and immoral.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:00.466]  But now we have Obama continuing snatch and grab, more black sites have been exposed all over Europe and Asia.
[00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:08.473]  We know this is intensifying, not subsiding, and so I guess they got away with it, so now it's secret policy in the CIA.
[00:24:09.594 --> 00:24:16.820]  Speaking as an academic, every administration who comes in tends to take on the tools which the previous administration used and were successful in using.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:25.647]  So frankly, you know, I don't believe there's going to be any great difference between the Bush White House and the Obama administration on a number of these policy issues.
[00:24:26.068 --> 00:24:29.671]  And let's cite, for example, Alex, the Kill Capture program.
[00:24:30.431 --> 00:24:37.397]  I've said on Fox News a couple different times recently that the Obama administration's been, their default position is killing people.
[00:24:37.677 --> 00:24:41.801]  And that's something I find totally idiotic as an intelligence officer.
[00:24:42.162 --> 00:24:45.165]  The idea is you need to capture people and find out what they know.
[00:24:45.585 --> 00:24:50.310]  So because they don't want to deal with the issues relating to what do we do with detainees?
[00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.233]  Do we put them on trial in a civilian court?
[00:24:53.253 --> 00:24:54.574]  Do we do military tribunals?
[00:24:54.875 --> 00:25:00.721]  Because they don't want to deal with that, now the default position is killing people, which you've read about recently with the issue of Al-Awlaki.
[00:25:01.621 --> 00:25:09.643]  Apparently, according to the news reports over the past two weeks, there is now essentially a death warrant been issued for him to be killed, if possible, by U.S.
[00:25:10.344 --> 00:25:12.164]  or Yemeni forces on site.
[00:25:12.404 --> 00:25:17.565]  So this is something, clearly, that I think we should be defaulting.
[00:25:17.606 --> 00:25:19.766]  Our default position should be capturing these individuals.
[00:25:20.286 --> 00:25:22.447]  And if we really can't, then I think we need to look at it.
[00:25:22.767 --> 00:25:24.487]  But we should be capturing them.
[00:25:25.008 --> 00:25:29.829]  And frankly, the other problem with this is that, in the extremist belief, Alex,
[00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:32.170]  Being a martyr is a great thing.
[00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.613]  I think we need to avoid giving them that opportunity to be a martyr.
[00:25:35.973 --> 00:25:39.115]  This includes Al-Awlaki and this includes Bin Laden, if he's still alive.
[00:25:40.816 --> 00:25:43.298]  Well, Osama Bin Laden, let's cut right to the chase.
[00:25:43.778 --> 00:25:46.440]  He trained in the 80s, worked with the CIA.
[00:25:47.021 --> 00:25:51.544]  We know the Muslim brigades have been used to destabilize countries the West doesn't like.
[00:25:51.564 --> 00:25:54.366]  They were used against the Soviets, they're being used against the Russians.
[00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:57.848]  Today, it's a convenient boogeyman out there.
[00:25:59.229 --> 00:26:06.472]  We know the underwear bomber was allowed on the plane, protected, given a visa by the U.S., an unnamed intelligence agency told the State Department this.
[00:26:07.012 --> 00:26:08.032]  This is on record.
[00:26:08.453 --> 00:26:10.753]  And then we get the internal Homeland Security documents.
[00:26:10.913 --> 00:26:17.076]  Most of Homeland Security now and NORTHCOM is set up for the American people, returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives.
[00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:19.557]  Law enforcement gave us those documents last year.
[00:26:19.917 --> 00:26:21.237]  They were confirmed to be accurate.
[00:26:21.697 --> 00:26:23.278]  And the Pentagon was hopping mad.
[00:26:23.318 --> 00:26:25.619]  And so was Homeland Security that we got them.
[00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:27.920]  But when we really look at this,
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.922]  This is a system that's been set up for the American people.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.901]  We know the Russians have staged terror.
[00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:03.363]  We know our own government has Operation Northwoods.
[00:27:03.723 --> 00:27:08.685]  What can you say about government actually being behind some of the terrorism in history?
[00:27:10.386 --> 00:27:13.808]  Well, Alex, I've got to stick with what I know to be the fact.
[00:27:13.848 --> 00:27:17.810]  I mean, some of these references you've mentioned I have not read.
[00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.511]  I can't speak to things I don't know.
[00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:20.552]  Do you know about Northwoods?
[00:27:21.328 --> 00:27:23.009]  Well, I don't know much about that.
[00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:24.070]  I've not studied that.
[00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:32.456]  But what I will say is that there's clearly, as of late, a tendency to start looking at internal threats more than external.
[00:27:32.516 --> 00:27:38.300]  Now, I cut my teeth as a lieutenant doing counterterrorism stuff in Germany back in the mid-80s.
[00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:42.263]  And it was very clear then, and I'm not sure what changed between then and now.
[00:27:42.983 --> 00:27:48.848]  In many aspects, but I know back then we were very much concerned about the Soviets funding radical groups within Germany.
[00:27:49.028 --> 00:27:56.213]  As a matter of fact, my first counter-terrorism operations were focused on the RAF sports group Hoffman and things like that.
[00:27:56.733 --> 00:28:02.558]  Whereas very clearly a third party, a third organization being the Soviet Union, was funding a lot of that activity.
[00:28:03.218 --> 00:28:07.922]  As noted by the fact that once the Cold War ended, a lot of these groups faded off into the distance and never came back.
[00:28:08.622 --> 00:28:17.027]  I think that we have to be very cognizant of the fact that there is some real energy being given now to our government looking internally.
[00:28:17.128 --> 00:28:23.852]  And I think in some cases it is not warranted by the fact that yes, you're going to have veterans coming back who have clear psychological problems.
[00:28:24.212 --> 00:28:26.734]  More than that, what are your Pentagon associates saying about the fact that
[00:28:41.148 --> 00:28:44.012]  I mean, as you admit, more of this is being swung around internally.
[00:28:44.372 --> 00:28:46.294]  From my research, I mean, here's an example.
[00:28:46.314 --> 00:28:55.345]  It came out in the Baltimore Sun that Ron Paul and myself and others, and we ended up getting the secret army document, which they confirmed was real, so those good guys in the military sent it to us.
[00:28:55.765 --> 00:28:55.905]  Wow.
[00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:21.394]  There's a number of legal problems with that, and one of the things I came up against during Able Danger, which was the issue of posse comitatus, and I think it's a very good law for a number of reasons.
[00:29:21.454 --> 00:29:29.458]  First off, as you just mentioned, it is illegal for the Army to be augmenting directly civil law enforcement operations.
[00:29:29.558 --> 00:29:30.799]  That is clearly illegal.
[00:29:30.879 --> 00:29:40.804]  So that's one of those things that I know people like Senator Arlen Specter were very much against the idea of allowing folks to be used for purposes of law enforcement, and there's good reasons for it.
[00:29:41.444 --> 00:29:51.090]  And this is something that harkens back to the 1960s, where it was equally a bad idea then to use military intelligence folks for civil law enforcement, and I think it's the same thing now, if this is going on.
[00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:57.354]  Now, I don't know of anyone within my circle of associates and friends who have been involved in that.
[00:29:57.894 --> 00:29:59.575]  It's not to say I don't know what's happening.
[00:29:59.895 --> 00:30:00.795]  I personally don't know.
[00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:01.695]  I've not been involved.
[00:30:01.755 --> 00:30:04.376]  I don't know of anyone of my intelligence friends who have been involved.
[00:30:04.396 --> 00:30:14.580]  But I know there's been contingency planning done to look at how the military could be brought in to support civil unrest, support the civil authorities during times of civil unrest.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.081]  Now, that's something that I know has been kicked around a lot over the past 30 years, frankly.
[00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:23.102]  The idea of coming in at a time of crisis to actually... Rex 84.
[00:30:23.382 --> 00:30:24.563]  Well, let me ask you this.
[00:30:25.303 --> 00:30:34.349]  I mean, I literally, in the last 10 years, have had guys get out, they're obviously military in plain clothes, and even threaten me in parking lots.
[00:30:34.769 --> 00:30:37.951]  I have national news everywhere saying I'm calling for violence when I'm not.
[00:30:37.971 --> 00:30:41.454]  Does it sound to you, Colonel, like they're trying to set me up for something?
[00:30:42.202 --> 00:30:44.643]  Well, it sounds like any other whisper campaign.
[00:30:44.703 --> 00:30:49.444]  I mean, Alex, as you know, I was victimized by a whisper campaign by the Pentagon as well when I first broke ranks.
[00:30:50.325 --> 00:30:56.527]  I think there's something else that you need to look at here regarding the fact that when, you know, there's something called CEPA.
[00:30:56.547 --> 00:30:57.367]  Are you familiar with CEPA?
[00:30:57.907 --> 00:30:59.928]  The counterintelligence force?
[00:31:00.508 --> 00:31:06.710]  Everything that I've heard about that was, and I hate to use this as a term, but it was like Darth Vader's Vanguard.
[00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.771]  By the fact that those people were, they had no interest in counterintelligence.
[00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:15.072]  They were essentially, as I understand it, Steve Cambone's Dirty Tricks folks.
[00:31:15.252 --> 00:31:25.415]  And they, in one case, they were surveilling a Secret Service special agent whose father was speaking out against the Bush administration.
[00:31:25.655 --> 00:31:27.836]  I mean, no, I have no doubt that this sort of thing has happened.
[00:31:27.956 --> 00:31:29.597]  So is this just harassment then?
[00:31:29.657 --> 00:31:34.180]  Because, I mean, it's like a no way out when he's walking along, and who are these guys?
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:41.164]  Well, they're formerly associated with special forces, and I'm just like a regular guy with a family who has a big talk show, but I mean, it's getting really creepy.
[00:31:42.485 --> 00:31:52.157]  And that's one of those things I think that this is why I spoke out against the use of blackwater contractors as some form of mercenary.
[00:31:52.678 --> 00:31:58.645]  And this is where there's been a real gray area, Alec, that we have to look at by the fact that I think that there's some real
[00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:05.868]  Uh, loopholes that have been used by the military and by the intelligence organizations to hire folks who serve in these roles.
[00:32:06.128 --> 00:32:07.609]  It's a very murky gray area.
[00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.372]  And for example, in Afghanistan, the CIA, Babatel recently denied it.
[00:32:12.732 --> 00:32:17.894]  I was there to handle two of the KIAs from CIA who were there as Blackwater back in 2003.
[00:32:18.615 --> 00:32:26.979]  So there's, this is a loophole that a number of organizations have used to hire people off the street who have military background to do things which I think
[00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:31.042]  If they were shown to be, in the light of day, they would be shown to be illegal.
[00:32:31.202 --> 00:32:37.727]  And this is where people have tried to get around posse comitatus, ways of trying to influence the thinking of adversaries.
[00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:42.831]  You know, and frankly, some people just don't appreciate people like you and others who speak out.
[00:32:42.891 --> 00:32:44.593]  And I think that's... But Colonel, now we're learning...
[00:32:44.793 --> 00:32:53.002]  Well, now we're learning the adversaries are somebody like you or me who just speak out for the Constitution and Bill of Rights as some type of Darth Vader Praetorian Guard.
[00:32:53.663 --> 00:32:58.148]  And I know a lot of JAG officers who are retired law professors we've had on.
[00:32:58.669 --> 00:33:04.055]  They're very, very concerned, you know, Atticott from San Antonio and others, but I mean,
[00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:15.018]  It's just for the general public out there, I don't think they realize that this whole black op or slash contractor, they may be contractors, are just out there really intimidating people, surveilling people.
[00:33:15.218 --> 00:33:16.258]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[00:33:16.298 --> 00:33:25.220]  I can't wait till August to have you on to really, really go over the book in detail and I hope people will order it because I know I'm going to read it and it's going to be extremely informative, Colonel Schaefer, but in closing,
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.403]  Shifting gears out to what happened in Poland.
[00:33:28.704 --> 00:33:35.612]  Do you think it's suspicious that the almost entire leadership of the Polish government's aircraft went down?
[00:33:36.732 --> 00:33:37.493]  Well, I get it.
[00:33:37.713 --> 00:33:38.573]  There's two parts to it.
[00:33:38.613 --> 00:33:45.058]  First, you know, it's like the old, whenever someone had a cold in Soviet leadership, you know, that was a bad sign.
[00:33:45.098 --> 00:33:49.381]  I think, you know, a cold is not a cold when it comes to Soviets.
[00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:51.342]  This may be something that people need to look at as well.
[00:33:52.223 --> 00:34:03.371]  From what I understand, the Polish president was very independent, and I think that the fact that everybody went down together in these questionable circumstances, you've got to look at that very hard.
[00:34:06.192 --> 00:34:10.113]  The Tupelov, which crashed, frankly, has a horrible, horrible record.
[00:34:11.114 --> 00:34:18.636]  When I flew back from Afghanistan, I flew through Tashkent, and the airline that I was supposed to fly back on flew a lot of those.
[00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:23.877]  Fortunately for me, they had pretty much grounded all the Tupelovs, and were now using Boeing aircraft.
[00:34:23.897 --> 00:34:27.898]  So that aircraft by itself has had a hugely poor safety record.
[00:34:27.918 --> 00:34:30.399]  But it is stupid to put that much leadership in one aircraft.
[00:34:30.999 --> 00:34:31.780]  Well, you never do it.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.062]  I mean, I think that's a mistake that you just shouldn't make.
[00:34:35.082 --> 00:34:36.663]  That's an amateur mistake, Alex.
[00:34:36.884 --> 00:34:38.124]  You should never make that mistake.
[00:34:38.505 --> 00:34:46.231]  Especially when you have basically the entire military general staff, pretty much every major officer within the government and the civilian side.
[00:34:47.071 --> 00:34:49.473]  You've got to ask yourself, why would they do that?
[00:34:49.493 --> 00:34:53.416]  Especially with an aircraft, as I mentioned, with that kind of poor safety record.
[00:34:53.816 --> 00:34:55.297]  Colonel, we've only got one minute left.
[00:34:55.317 --> 00:34:57.319]  You wanted to make a comment on the bombing in Ireland.
[00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:58.140]  What's your take on that?
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:07.485]  Well, you know, I think it's, frankly, from what I've seen from being here just a little bit of time, is that there's still a great deal of dissension within Northern Ireland.
[00:35:08.006 --> 00:35:09.547]  I think there's some chaos there.
[00:35:09.647 --> 00:35:13.269]  I think that as things settle in, you're going to see a few things like this.
[00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:17.732]  But I think the good news is, if there's any good news, is the fact that I think things have been reduced.
[00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:19.033]  You don't have these mass bombings.
[00:35:19.633 --> 00:35:21.874]  If nothing else, there was no casualties in this.
[00:35:22.435 --> 00:35:23.916]  I think it was meant to send a message.
[00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:27.538]  So, at least here, I believe, I think they're on a downhill run of
[00:35:28.058 --> 00:35:29.599]  Terrorism being an effective tool.
[00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:34.381]  I'm hoping that people understand that, you know, that things here are pretty much settled, I think.
[00:35:34.421 --> 00:35:35.982]  But in other places, they're not.
[00:35:36.162 --> 00:35:40.764]  I think that, you know, anytime we look at terrorism, we have to look realistically at long-term threats.
[00:35:41.525 --> 00:35:44.466]  Another thing that I'd like to bring up briefly, we can talk about another time, is Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:44.766 --> 00:35:47.948]  President Obama made a statement which I think is very accurate about Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:47.968 --> 00:35:48.608]  Hold on, Colonel!
[00:35:48.648 --> 00:35:50.169]  Hold on, let me at least say bye to him!
[00:35:50.229 --> 00:35:51.830]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:58.524 --> 00:36:03.867]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:36:05.168 --> 00:36:09.931]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:17.115]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:36:19.016 --> 00:36:21.498]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:25.480]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:36:27.369 --> 00:36:31.392]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:36:32.113 --> 00:36:35.235]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:36:35.936 --> 00:36:36.777]  Others don't.
[00:36:37.177 --> 00:36:39.078]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:36:39.319 --> 00:36:40.840]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.702]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:36:44.002 --> 00:36:50.268]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:36:50.628 --> 00:36:52.850]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.372]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:36:55.692 --> 00:36:56.573]  Others don't.
[00:36:58.598 --> 00:37:01.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.564]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:08.666]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:37:08.986 --> 00:37:13.810]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.950]  How much do you want?
[00:37:15.171 --> 00:37:15.911]  When do you want it?
[00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:17.893]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:37:18.173 --> 00:37:18.994]  When will you need it?
[00:37:19.254 --> 00:37:21.315]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:37:21.455 --> 00:37:22.576]  Will there be any food?
[00:37:22.796 --> 00:37:24.097]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:37:24.838 --> 00:37:26.680]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.362]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:37:29.582 --> 00:37:32.765]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:37:33.165 --> 00:37:36.648]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:37.969]  How much will you need?
[00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.810]  We don't know.
[00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.031]  How much do you want?
[00:37:40.211 --> 00:37:40.932]  All you can get.
[00:37:40.952 --> 00:37:41.993]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:37:42.253 --> 00:37:44.995]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:47.477]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:37:52.802 --> 00:37:56.704]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:37:57.965 --> 00:37:58.946]  What's your home worth?
[00:37:59.106 --> 00:38:01.067]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:38:01.227 --> 00:38:03.968]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:38:04.269 --> 00:38:11.793]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:38:11.993 --> 00:38:15.395]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[00:38:15.635 --> 00:38:17.757]  It's so easy, and best of all, it's free.
[00:38:18.098 --> 00:38:26.127]  At HomeGain.com, you can compare realtors anonymously, receive customized proposals, see consumer reviews, then select the best realtor for you.
[00:38:26.367 --> 00:38:29.371]  Go to HomeGain.com and get an instant home value estimate.
[00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:30.532]  View comparable homes.
[00:38:30.752 --> 00:38:31.132]  I think so.
[00:39:01.701 --> 00:39:04.722]  Colonel Tony Schaffer has been really nice giving us his time.
[00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:06.282]  He's on vacation in Ireland.
[00:39:06.302 --> 00:39:09.363]  We're letting him go here just a few minutes, but putting bookends on this.
[00:39:10.343 --> 00:39:13.364]  Get into your Al-Qaeda point, but what is Al-Qaeda?
[00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:18.506]  We know it's a Brzezinski computer file of the CIA in 1979.
[00:39:19.206 --> 00:39:26.128]  We know it's a term used to try to simplistically label, I guess, Wahhabist sects out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:39:26.168 --> 00:39:27.268]  We know those do exist.
[00:39:27.768 --> 00:39:35.089]  We know there's different factions in Saudi Arabia and Princeton, where you've got different princes fighting with each other.
[00:39:35.369 --> 00:39:44.231]  So we know there's a lot of different groups and organizations, but it just came out last week in federal documents that one of the ringleaders of the Mumbai attack was a, quote, U.S.
[00:39:44.271 --> 00:39:47.752]  government agent and helped lead the attack.
[00:39:47.832 --> 00:39:51.913]  And so I keep going back to that over and over again.
[00:39:51.953 --> 00:39:53.673]  I mean, what is al-Qaeda today?
[00:39:55.046 --> 00:40:05.531]  Well, I think we have to look at this realistically because if the intelligence community is doing its job, Alex, they're going to have people who will hopefully have access to the organization.
[00:40:05.571 --> 00:40:14.295]  The problem is, and this is what's happened with Cap Chapman, I think a lot of the CIA's activities lately have been focused on wishful thinking.
[00:40:14.355 --> 00:40:17.577]  I think they recruit people thinking they're going to work for the U.S.
[00:40:17.797 --> 00:40:19.377]  and they're true believers.
[00:40:19.878 --> 00:40:21.358]  There's really no level of
[00:40:23.229 --> 00:40:26.554]  Of benefit you can give them to make them walk away from what they believe.
[00:40:26.574 --> 00:40:27.816]  So I think that's what we're seeing here.
[00:40:27.996 --> 00:40:29.919]  You're saying double, double and triple agents?
[00:40:29.939 --> 00:40:30.199]  Yes.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.361]  Absolutely.
[00:40:31.581 --> 00:40:32.142]  Absolutely.
[00:40:32.202 --> 00:40:39.072]  I think that's what we're seeing here where I think it's almost a policy of wishful thinking hoping these guys will really come over and support us.
[00:40:39.412 --> 00:40:41.514]  And then they get triple-crossed back, essentially.
[00:40:41.794 --> 00:40:45.436]  Peter Lance did a great book on this called Triple Cross, where it talks about Ali Mohammed.
[00:40:45.957 --> 00:40:50.220]  That very thing happened there, where the guy was doubled and tripled back against us.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.161]  And I think that's what we're seeing here a lot of.
[00:40:52.201 --> 00:40:55.383]  And we're not being smart as we should to detect when they've been double-crossed.
[00:40:55.403 --> 00:40:57.105]  Well, the Arabs are running short on time.
[00:40:57.145 --> 00:41:02.028]  A few months ago, that CIA base in Central Asia getting blown up, was that a double-cross?
[00:41:03.009 --> 00:41:03.989]  Oh, a triple-cross, absolutely.
[00:41:04.009 --> 00:41:07.432]  That guy never left his true belief in al-Qaeda.
[00:41:07.692 --> 00:41:08.733]  And that's why those people died.
[00:41:09.932 --> 00:41:10.933]  So what is Al-Qaeda?
[00:41:12.133 --> 00:41:22.219]  Well, I think Al-Qaeda is essentially a franchise of terrorism that the radicals within the Muslim community have been able to use to sustain themselves and try and tie together.
[00:41:22.299 --> 00:41:26.941]  I think, for example, al-Awlaki is really the primary operational leader right now.
[00:41:27.001 --> 00:41:28.622]  He's the one who's actually able to plan things.
[00:41:29.242 --> 00:41:33.285]  So I think that he is realistically kind of the lead guy right now in Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:35.626]  I think that's why the focus is so heavy on him.
[00:41:35.686 --> 00:41:38.848]  He's been able to pick up his franchise and do a lot with it.
[00:41:39.548 --> 00:41:42.230]  What about Obama saying he's worried about Al Qaeda getting nukes?
[00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:45.714]  I mean, that sounds as ridiculous as saying Saddam Hussein had nukes.
[00:41:46.533 --> 00:41:50.896]  Well, I can tell you that there's a great deal of effort going on to look at this issue realistically right now, Alex.
[00:41:50.956 --> 00:41:55.999]  I think that there's a good potential that that's where they want to go for their next big attack.
[00:41:56.179 --> 00:41:57.400]  And I don't think they've let down.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.322]  So I know this may be hard for you and your listeners to accept.
[00:42:01.722 --> 00:42:03.884]  I believe that they are going in that direction.
[00:42:03.924 --> 00:42:05.084]  I believe that's where they're going next.
[00:42:07.146 --> 00:42:10.408]  Could the Russians, like Alexander Leavitt say, actually sell nukes?
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.367]  I believe there's people within the infrastructure who'd be willing to sell the nuclear weapon based on personal gain.
[00:42:16.387 --> 00:42:17.189]  Yeah, I do believe that.
[00:42:19.284 --> 00:42:21.325]  So that's something to be cognizant of.
[00:42:21.545 --> 00:42:22.406]  I'm not saying it would happen.
[00:42:22.446 --> 00:42:24.607]  I think that that's something we need to be realistically looking at.
[00:42:24.627 --> 00:42:31.411]  Well, you're going to be able to talk about a lot more of this coming up in August when the book The Dark Side of the Force comes out.
[00:42:31.712 --> 00:42:33.092]  We look forward to speaking to you then.
[00:42:33.333 --> 00:42:33.973]  Thanks for the time.
[00:42:34.513 --> 00:42:34.894]  Thank you.
[00:42:35.634 --> 00:42:35.894]  All right.
[00:42:35.914 --> 00:42:38.256]  There goes Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer.
[00:42:38.696 --> 00:42:39.897]  Very interesting interview.
[00:42:39.997 --> 00:42:42.938]  Very interesting individual joining us from Ireland.
[00:42:44.179 --> 00:42:45.100]  OK, here's the deal.
[00:42:46.189 --> 00:43:01.101]  We got Jim Tucker coming up for 30 minutes in the next hour, and then I want to do a video game review, because more and more of these video games have a pro-New World Order or anti-New World Order message, and video games in many cases are bigger than the biggest Hollywood films.
[00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:04.904]  Some of these video game franchises have made over a billion bucks in the last two years.
[00:43:05.805 --> 00:43:09.828]  Things like Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, things like that.
[00:43:11.974 --> 00:43:15.877]  There's an InfoWars.com review of Half-Life 2 that's been out for a few years.
[00:43:16.418 --> 00:43:23.364]  But in this video game, they have DARPA control towers that mesmerize the public and people are microchipped.
[00:43:23.824 --> 00:43:26.326]  All of this is what is actually being promoted.
[00:43:26.346 --> 00:43:28.027]  I mean, that's mainstream information.
[00:43:28.468 --> 00:43:31.891]  You tell somebody, hey, the government can put up mine control towers.
[00:43:31.931 --> 00:43:34.273]  Well, DARPA has been talking about that in newspapers.
[00:43:34.313 --> 00:43:38.917]  I mean, they're openly talking about drugging the water supply on Fox News to make us
[00:43:39.657 --> 00:43:40.277]  We're passive.
[00:43:40.377 --> 00:43:41.398]  It's already going on.
[00:43:41.438 --> 00:43:42.798]  That's why we are so passive.
[00:43:43.038 --> 00:43:52.982]  The most aggressive, rebellious people ever in the history of the world, maybe some of the Greeks were more aggressive, but definitely some of the most aggressive people ever, will suddenly put up with anything.
[00:43:53.002 --> 00:43:55.643]  Because your food, your water, and other things are being spiked.
[00:43:56.623 --> 00:44:02.446]  It doesn't matter if you're Colonel Schaeffer, or a cop down the street, or Alex Jones, we're all under attack by this.
[00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:08.188]  And he wasn't even shocked by the fact that I talk about the Pentagon following us around.
[00:44:09.403 --> 00:44:19.967]  And going to end the Fed rallies, and then when I go to a Bilderberg meeting, I'm at my hotel five miles away, and the Feds waddle in and say, Jones, let's attack the State Department tonight together.
[00:44:20.668 --> 00:44:23.669]  I mean, the Feds know full well I'm not going to attack the State Department.
[00:44:23.969 --> 00:44:26.010]  They know full well I'm not going to attack the police.
[00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:38.715]  They know full well I'm trying to keep people from getting violent here, and that's what's making them mad, and that's why multiple major publications per day are lying and saying I'm calling for violence.
[00:44:40.715 --> 00:44:45.117]  And I'm going to get to that in a moment after we take some more of your phone calls.
[00:44:45.177 --> 00:44:49.439]  It's just driving me crazy to see this happening.
[00:44:49.739 --> 00:44:54.822]  They changed my computer around where my IMs are under a different icon.
[00:44:55.362 --> 00:44:56.303]  So I can see the call list.
[00:44:56.423 --> 00:44:57.183]  How do I pull that up?
[00:44:58.644 --> 00:45:02.025]  Somehow that got minimized in here because I won't be able to pull it up in there.
[00:45:03.486 --> 00:45:04.667]  I need to be able to pull it up here.
[00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:06.046]  Okay, good.
[00:45:06.066 --> 00:45:07.127]  You're in control of my computer.
[00:45:07.768 --> 00:45:08.248]  That's good.
[00:45:09.289 --> 00:45:10.449]  Okay, fresh list here.
[00:45:10.529 --> 00:45:13.031]  John Wyoming, Tom, Jim, Jimmy, Ryan, and others.
[00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:14.512]  Let's race through your calls.
[00:45:15.753 --> 00:45:17.114]  Let's talk to John in Wyoming.
[00:45:17.134 --> 00:45:17.955]  You're on the air, John.
[00:45:19.296 --> 00:45:19.836]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:45:20.336 --> 00:45:20.657]  Welcome.
[00:45:20.697 --> 00:45:21.377]  Can you hear me?
[00:45:21.397 --> 00:45:21.657]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:21.717 --> 00:45:21.918]  Alex?
[00:45:22.638 --> 00:45:22.958]  Okay.
[00:45:23.439 --> 00:45:28.262]  A couple of years ago, I saw a great documentary on TV about post-World War II Europe.
[00:45:29.163 --> 00:45:35.167]  And Poland's leader at the time was a very patriotic man, just as this man who died the other day.
[00:45:36.062 --> 00:45:43.866]  And he was vehemently opposed to the Allies turning over Poland as well as all of Eastern Europe to Joseph Stalin after the end of the war.
[00:45:44.907 --> 00:45:55.353]  And mysteriously one day he got aboard his plane, which had been tampered with not by the Russians but by the Allies, and it crashed on the island of Malta, killing this man.
[00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:59.435]  It's now been declassified, uh, that, um,
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.541]  That our own government killed Patton because he didn't want to hand stuff over to the commies.
[00:46:05.982 --> 00:46:20.207]  And that's what Jesse Ventura was talking about from Fletcher Prouty, the head of Black Ops, in the book The Secret Team, that our government made a deal with the Soviets to divide up the world and have third world intractable wars to build up their own power bases.
[00:46:20.267 --> 00:46:21.107]  It's all staged.
[00:46:21.148 --> 00:46:24.829]  Now, there does appear to be a real split now between Russia
[00:46:25.189 --> 00:46:25.389]  I think?
[00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:50.434]  They have come out, for those who just joined us, I covered it earlier, and said, we're not going along with the European Union, we may get out of it.
[00:46:50.794 --> 00:46:56.076]  In fact, here's the headline, New York Times, Kaczynski often at a source of tension with the EU.
[00:46:56.497 --> 00:46:56.717]  And see,
[00:46:58.317 --> 00:46:59.919]  Iceland has said no to the takeover.
[00:47:00.039 --> 00:47:02.501]  Greece is going along with it, only partially.
[00:47:02.841 --> 00:47:11.527]  But if Poland says no to the banks taking them over and looting them, and this program of austerity, the whole European Union could implode.
[00:47:11.547 --> 00:47:14.529]  And that's not Alex Jones saying that, that's George Soros.
[00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:19.373]  So, this is leaning towards it being a blackout by NATO.
[00:47:19.413 --> 00:47:21.775]  But it could be the Russians as well, or it could be natural.
[00:47:21.815 --> 00:47:22.115]  Go ahead.
[00:47:22.793 --> 00:47:34.380]  Well, I think that our people did him in much as they did the Polish leader in in 1945, who wasn't going to go along with that giveaway of Poland and all of Eastern Europe to Joseph Stalin.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.681]  I mean, we spent 150,000 American lives
[00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:40.059]  No, I remember reading about that.
[00:47:40.119 --> 00:47:40.739]  Anything else, John?
[00:48:04.178 --> 00:48:06.539]  No sir, that'll do it, and hope you have a great day.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.640]  You too, my friend.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.002]  Yeah, I mean, people ask, why is Alex Jones still alive?
[00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:16.165]  Well, if they kill me, it just makes all my information and material that much more popular.
[00:48:16.185 --> 00:48:17.706]  It kind of highlights everything I've done.
[00:48:19.787 --> 00:48:31.954]  But somebody like a Polish president, who says, I don't like the Russians, but I'm starting to not like NATO and the EU, and you've destroyed our economy with globalization, and we're going to get out of this.
[00:48:32.898 --> 00:48:37.159]  And they announced that they were going to do that last week, and five days later he's deader than a hammer.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:48.061]  And as soon as we get a hold of Tarpley in the next few days, we'll get him on to give us his take because he really is an expert in this whole area.
[00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:50.462]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Texas.
[00:48:50.482 --> 00:48:51.182]  Tom, you're on the air.
[00:48:52.382 --> 00:48:52.922]  Hello, Alex.
[00:48:52.962 --> 00:48:53.602]  How are you doing today?
[00:48:53.822 --> 00:48:54.142]  Good, sir.
[00:48:55.603 --> 00:48:56.783]  Had a good vacation, I hope.
[00:48:58.563 --> 00:49:00.724]  April 9th of this year,
[00:49:02.156 --> 00:49:09.721]  Sheriff Arvin West of Hudspeth County told citizens to arm themselves because we can no longer protect them from spillover of border violence.
[00:49:10.441 --> 00:49:12.923]  That's the third largest county in the state of Texas.
[00:49:13.243 --> 00:49:19.687]  Let me stop you because we have an Ohio County doing it and a Michigan County saying arm yourselves.
[00:49:20.928 --> 00:49:28.533]  But a sheriff, and we've had a lot of South Texas sheriffs on, give me the name of the sheriff because I want to pull an article on this right now and I also want to get the sheriff on.
[00:49:28.953 --> 00:49:29.534]  Give me the name.
[00:49:30.609 --> 00:49:37.755]  Arvin, A-R-V-I-N, West of Hudspeth County, Texas.
[00:49:37.835 --> 00:49:38.895]  It borders El Paso.
[00:49:40.056 --> 00:49:40.797]  What's his name again?
[00:49:41.838 --> 00:49:43.239]  Arvin West.
[00:49:43.259 --> 00:49:47.222]  Okay, I thought you said Arvin West of... Okay, Arvin West, and where is he?
[00:49:48.303 --> 00:49:52.146]  Hudspeth County, H-U-D-S-P-E-T-H.
[00:49:52.566 --> 00:49:53.947]  It borders El Paso County.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.764]  So what we should say is South Texas Sheriff says arm yourselves to protect yourselves?
[00:50:01.785 --> 00:50:03.906]  Well, it's more of a West Texas.
[00:50:04.007 --> 00:50:09.231]  It's the county that you go through before you get to El Paso County.
[00:50:09.771 --> 00:50:13.914]  Yeah, I just see that as South because it's down there by the border, but sure.
[00:50:14.174 --> 00:50:15.455]  Yeah, Southwest.
[00:50:15.956 --> 00:50:17.257]  Texas is on the border.
[00:50:18.178 --> 00:50:23.782]  Anyway, what I'm saying is he's telling people in that county to arm themselves because you can't protect them anymore.
[00:50:24.818 --> 00:50:36.445]  Also in the statement he said that Rick Perry had activated the Texas border violence spillover contingency plan in which he requested federal aid.
[00:50:37.645 --> 00:50:42.328]  Is that all that our government and our governor and the state of Texas is going to do?
[00:50:42.348 --> 00:50:44.149]  They're just going to let this continue?
[00:50:46.946 --> 00:50:50.967]  Well, I remember last year, what was the Texas State Senator we had on?
[00:50:51.007 --> 00:50:52.767]  We need to get him back on, I forget his name.
[00:50:53.208 --> 00:51:02.270]  He said martial law had secretly been declared last year on the Texas border because they believe Mexico will fully collapse into anarchy because of the drug war.
[00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.411]  If they decriminalize drugs, it would all end, like a storm blowing over.
[00:51:07.651 --> 00:51:11.692]  The drug war is meant, just like China was brought down with the drug war, it's meant to bring us down.
[00:51:12.013 --> 00:51:13.453]  And so there's no way they're going to stop.
[00:51:14.093 --> 00:51:25.457]  But I did get the article, it's a Sheriff Arvin West of Hudspeth County, Texas tells citizens to arm themselves as you can no longer protect them from spillover border violence.
[00:51:26.958 --> 00:51:30.559]  So absolutely, and that's over on the border in West Texas by El Paso.
[00:51:34.778 --> 00:51:35.538]  Michael Burgess.
[00:51:35.678 --> 00:51:38.319]  Get Michael Burgess back on about this situation.
[00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:39.739]  Uh, good points.
[00:51:39.779 --> 00:51:41.060]  Anything else you want to add, Caller?
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:53.623]  Well, all I wanted to say was, uh, maybe the rest of us start thinking along these lines also because the obvious Rick Perry is not going to do anything and it's obvious that, uh, Barry Satoro is not going to do anything.
[00:51:53.663 --> 00:51:58.924]  I think he's going to let it get to a critical boiling point and then declare martial law and take our rights away.
[00:51:59.565 --> 00:52:09.555]  I agree with you, but again, martial law was covertly declared over a year ago, and that was even in some of the El Paso and other west and south Texas papers.
[00:52:09.975 --> 00:52:16.462]  And I remember six, seven years ago talking about rocket attacks, hand grenade attacks, 17,000 dead this year just on the border.
[00:52:16.922 --> 00:52:22.868]  I mean, it is just, I mean, once beautiful towns are just boarded up, high rises, totaled, and now
[00:52:23.729 --> 00:52:25.890]  It's getting like that in other cities in the state.
[00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:31.652]  But when there's a car bombing with the Mexican Mafia killing somebody in Dallas, it's a footnote to the Dallas Morning News.
[00:52:32.173 --> 00:52:35.414]  Meanwhile, I'm here calling for nonviolence in the medias.
[00:52:35.714 --> 00:52:36.975]  Alex Jones is deadly!
[00:52:36.995 --> 00:52:38.935]  He wants to kill the government!
[00:52:39.176 --> 00:52:40.256]  Government, get him!
[00:52:40.536 --> 00:52:41.016]  Get him!
[00:52:41.336 --> 00:52:43.517]  Because we're here exposing their whole scam.
[00:52:43.537 --> 00:52:44.658]  I appreciate your call, Tom.
[00:52:45.398 --> 00:52:48.039]  Man, how many articles have I seen just the last few days?
[00:52:48.059 --> 00:52:51.501]  I'm looking for my stack here.
[00:52:52.866 --> 00:52:54.247]  Oh, it's in my economy stack.
[00:52:54.847 --> 00:52:57.488]  Where finally the truth is coming out.
[00:52:58.848 --> 00:53:01.409]  The police are saying all money goes to the banks now.
[00:53:01.749 --> 00:53:03.290]  They're firing more than half of us.
[00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:04.050]  Buy guns!
[00:53:06.091 --> 00:53:08.932]  But, I mean, you could have, look at New York, look at Chicago.
[00:53:08.992 --> 00:53:10.712]  More cops than the other cities per capita.
[00:53:10.992 --> 00:53:11.813]  Highest crime rate.
[00:53:12.233 --> 00:53:15.454]  The cops, if they wanted to protect you, can't protect you.
[00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:18.704]  You can't have a cop in every house.
[00:53:19.644 --> 00:53:20.704]  You can disarm everyone.
[00:53:20.744 --> 00:53:22.005]  The criminals are still going to have guns.
[00:53:22.065 --> 00:53:23.325]  It's so elementary.
[00:53:24.165 --> 00:53:25.086]  It's so elementary.
[00:53:25.506 --> 00:53:34.268]  And on the YouTube videos of these local newscasts where the sheriffs are saying, arm yourselves, I see comments going, if we ban all guns, this would just end.
[00:53:34.448 --> 00:53:35.249]  Oh yes, ban all.
[00:53:35.609 --> 00:53:39.390]  Then the murderers would use pickaxes and daggers and clubs.
[00:53:41.113 --> 00:53:42.814]  I mean, it's asinine.
[00:53:42.854 --> 00:53:47.055]  The answer is more guns, more guns, more guns, more guns.
[00:53:47.435 --> 00:53:49.656]  And the American people have known this for over a year.
[00:53:49.676 --> 00:53:52.097]  What was it?
[00:53:52.657 --> 00:53:57.118]  14 million guns sold last year, another 3.5 million sold last time.
[00:53:57.298 --> 00:54:00.799]  That's almost 18 million guns in the last year and three months.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:02.980]  18 million guns sold?
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.041]  The people know what's going on.
[00:54:07.651 --> 00:54:13.514]  I don't think some of the general public realizes just how bad it is and how crazy the times are and what we're going into.
[00:54:13.874 --> 00:54:15.115]  We're in a depression, folks.
[00:54:15.135 --> 00:54:17.176]  We've had a recession going for at least three years.
[00:54:18.397 --> 00:54:19.938]  Three quarters of a recession.
[00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.921]  With unemployment above 20% is a depression.
[00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:27.542]  Unemployment is not 10% like the news says.
[00:54:28.042 --> 00:54:29.623]  Every major private firm says 22%.
[00:54:32.205 --> 00:54:32.945]  Makes me dizzy.
[00:54:33.045 --> 00:54:33.966]  It really gives me a headache.
[00:54:34.366 --> 00:54:36.087]  Jim in Illinois, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:54:37.142 --> 00:54:38.202]  Alex, can you hear me?
[00:54:38.562 --> 00:54:38.983]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:40.063 --> 00:54:40.523]  All right.
[00:54:41.343 --> 00:54:48.965]  I'm from the People's Republic of Illinois, and I have one comment and one question.
[00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:51.466]  First, I want to give you a little background.
[00:54:52.126 --> 00:54:58.068]  I have a family member in federal law enforcement, but I'll tell you a bottom line.
[00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:02.889]  My wife got me a Romanian AK-47 for Valentine's Day.
[00:55:03.129 --> 00:55:05.550]  Nothing says love like an assault rifle.
[00:55:06.425 --> 00:55:10.929]  My comment is about this Polish, um, crash.
[00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:12.650]  You there?
[00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:13.811]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:14.912 --> 00:55:15.292]  All right.
[00:55:15.432 --> 00:55:17.073]  It seems a little suspicious to me.
[00:55:17.093 --> 00:55:28.222]  This is supposed to be the anniversary of essentially a Russian genocide of Polish, um, intelligence officers and whatever they are.
[00:55:28.983 --> 00:55:30.164]  And all of a sudden it crashes.
[00:55:30.204 --> 00:55:31.785]  That seems just a little, you know,
[00:55:33.248 --> 00:55:34.329]  It doesn't fit with me, right?
[00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:39.653]  No, no, I had thought that as well, but is it meant to be blamed on the Russians, or did the Russians do it?
[00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:40.213]  I don't know.
[00:55:40.233 --> 00:55:42.074]  I don't know either.
[00:55:42.094 --> 00:55:43.496]  I'm just putting out the question.
[00:55:44.656 --> 00:55:47.438]  And, by the way, I want to hear you on Coastmore.
[00:55:48.139 --> 00:55:51.421]  And WLS here in Chicago cuts it off after two hours.
[00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:52.702]  It's just pretty crappy.
[00:55:53.303 --> 00:55:54.604]  Okay, here's my question.
[00:55:55.624 --> 00:56:00.388]  I'm a little scared about Obama's latest statement
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:10.707]  About how he is concerned about these, uh, he didn't say suitcase, but essentially suitcase nukes in the hands of terrorists.
[00:56:10.727 --> 00:56:11.948]  No, I brought that up with Schaefer.
[00:56:12.008 --> 00:56:14.090]  He's saying the main threat is now nukes.
[00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:18.393]  And how many times have I said that's the way for revolutionaries to take over?
[00:56:18.433 --> 00:56:19.474]  Michael Savage agrees.
[00:56:19.814 --> 00:56:23.597]  Limbaugh has said there's no way Obama is going to get re-elected.
[00:56:23.617 --> 00:56:25.919]  The Democrats are going to have to stage a crisis.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.300]  Let's just come out with it.
[00:56:27.781 --> 00:56:28.942]  The globalist banks
[00:56:29.602 --> 00:56:31.743]  ...are looking at setting off a nuke in this country.
[00:56:32.123 --> 00:56:42.307]  They will even go that far to get everybody scared, to bow down to Obama and do whatever they say, to then go off and launch new wars to try to get the economy going again.
[00:56:42.647 --> 00:56:44.267]  And I think this is a serious issue.
[00:56:44.307 --> 00:56:46.168]  In fact, it's in my stack, but I may not find it.
[00:56:46.488 --> 00:56:48.609]  Reprint, Obama worried about nuclear terrorism.
[00:56:48.669 --> 00:56:49.149]  It's AP.
[00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:50.930]  We'll come back, comment on that.
[00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:52.850]  Jim Tucker inside the Bilderberg Group.
[00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:57.472]  We know the location of the real enemies of humanity, the real illegitimate government straight ahead.
[00:57:00.467 --> 00:57:03.849]  If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem go away by yourself.
[00:57:04.049 --> 00:57:07.632]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved once and for all.

[00:57:29.125 --> 00:57:30.886]  Sometimes even completely eliminated.

[00:57:50.295 --> 00:57:51.115]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:51.515]  That's 800-34, no tax.
[00:57:58.789 --> 00:58:01.091]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:01.111 --> 00:58:03.373]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:03.493 --> 00:58:06.336]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:06.696 --> 00:58:11.460]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:16.004]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:58:16.324 --> 00:58:18.646]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:58:18.666 --> 00:58:21.208]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:58:21.548 --> 00:58:24.130]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:32.076]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:58:32.396 --> 00:58:37.699]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:58:37.799 --> 00:58:40.060]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:44.082]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:58:44.322 --> 00:58:45.243]  And I got news for you.
[00:58:45.403 --> 00:58:46.704]  You're everyone else.
[00:58:46.744 --> 00:58:47.844]  Invisible Empire.

[00:59:00.374 --> 00:59:02.176]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:59:02.497 --> 00:59:02.817]  Fact.
[00:59:03.037 --> 00:59:06.382]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:59:06.722 --> 00:59:07.043]  Fact.
[00:59:07.323 --> 00:59:12.650]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:13.111]  Fact.
[00:59:13.471 --> 00:59:17.312]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.

[00:59:18.233 --> 00:59:21.994]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:14.932]  Here's the headline, Obama, nuclear terrorism is the single biggest threat to U.S.
[01:00:15.472 --> 01:00:21.053]  But you get the internal homeland security documents, it's gun-owning, libertarian, constitutionalist Americans.
[01:00:21.533 --> 01:00:23.973]  You're the big threat to the bankers.
[01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:29.754]  You are the legitimate American people that are the power, that are the sovereigns in this country.
[01:00:29.814 --> 01:00:31.215]  Hence, you are the enemy of the bankers.
[01:00:34.635 --> 01:00:38.696]  And, well, we'll cover this in a moment.
[01:00:40.592 --> 01:00:50.847]  Then I'm going to continue with your calls and Jim Tucker and I promise to get into all these attacks on free speech and what's happening with the economy and a lot more.
[01:00:50.907 --> 01:00:54.592]  Before we go there, I'm very excited
[01:00:55.663 --> 01:01:01.465]  to see the big response in pre-orders for Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA and Invisible Empire, A New Order Defined.
[01:01:02.165 --> 01:01:05.906]  Both of these films are designed to wake up people that don't know what's going on.
[01:01:05.946 --> 01:01:15.129]  You watch the two hour, twenty-something minute Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA, you will know about the shadow government, the FEMA camps are proven without a shadow of a doubt, how the COG
[01:01:16.369 --> 01:01:23.553]  System Works, the Executive Orders, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the riot police and military attacking people at G20.
[01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.494]  It's an amazing film.
[01:01:25.574 --> 01:01:26.554]  Pre-order it today.
[01:01:26.594 --> 01:01:27.995]  It starts shipping out next week.
[01:01:29.216 --> 01:01:34.138]  If you order Invisible Empire, it arrived today.
[01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:39.381]  We have thousands and thousands of the DVDs, and we're going to start shipping them out tomorrow.
[01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:43.103]  So many people will get them on or before the 15th.
[01:01:43.323 --> 01:01:44.583]  UPS ships anywhere in the U.S.
[01:01:44.623 --> 01:01:45.144]  in four days.
[01:01:46.645 --> 01:01:48.547]  And I think it's five days all over Europe.
[01:01:48.988 --> 01:02:04.746]  The point is, if you want to order Invisible Empire, that's the history of the New World Order, their money laundering, their drug dealing, their white slavery, their pervert rings, how they use the roundtable groups to control, how they openly want to world government, this is a two-hour, 15-minute
[01:02:06.748 --> 01:02:07.989]  And they have expanded extras.

[01:03:25.266 --> 01:03:26.266]  We can't afford the bandwidth.
[01:03:26.686 --> 01:03:32.568]  But I did turn it up to six a year ago or so, instead of three, so that you could share it with friends and family.
[01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:33.868]  Give them your username, passcode.

[01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:50.955]  It's now six years up and running.
[01:03:51.055 --> 01:03:53.657]  We launched it in early April, six years ago.
[01:03:54.678 --> 01:04:01.483]  In 2004, we are now six years of PrisonPlanet.TV, and we're adding more to it, upgrading it.
[01:04:01.503 --> 01:04:08.088]  We did an upgrade last year, we're doing another upgrade in the next few months, making PrisonPlanet.TV better and better and better.
[01:04:08.128 --> 01:04:14.714]  It's an armory of info weapon resistance, and it is the... it is the...
[01:04:17.608 --> 01:04:19.389]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:04:19.409 --> 01:04:21.551]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:04:48.123 --> 01:04:50.444]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:04:50.464 --> 01:04:52.746]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:04:52.826 --> 01:04:55.587]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:04:56.027 --> 01:05:00.810]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:05.372]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:05:05.673 --> 01:05:07.914]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:05:08.114 --> 01:05:10.535]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:05:10.896 --> 01:05:13.457]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:05:13.797 --> 01:05:21.422]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:05:21.742 --> 01:05:27.065]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:29.427]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:33.389]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:05:33.669 --> 01:05:34.589]  And I got news for you.
[01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.050]  You're everyone else.
[01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:37.191]  Invisible Empire.

[01:05:51.317 --> 01:05:53.278]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:05:53.678 --> 01:05:56.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:12.488 --> 01:06:13.969]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:13.989 --> 01:06:15.490]  We're getting Jim Tucker on the line.
[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:21.512]  After working for various newspapers, Tucker started writing for the Spotlight in the 70s.
[01:06:23.052 --> 01:06:25.994]  He now works for American Free Press, the reincarnation of that paper.
[01:06:26.014 --> 01:06:34.882]  Tucker's efforts to infiltrate the 99 Bilderberg meeting at the hotel in Parque Centro, Portugal, were chronicled by British reporter John Ronson in his book Them.
[01:06:35.682 --> 01:06:37.844]  He's also been in Channel 4's Secret Rulers of the World.
[01:06:38.725 --> 01:06:40.907]  He published Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary.
[01:06:41.307 --> 01:06:47.092]  Tucker is featured prominently in the film made by paleoconservative Alex Jones, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:06:49.011 --> 01:06:52.653]  And of course, we are honored to have him with us today.
[01:06:52.713 --> 01:06:58.476]  He's also featured in the documentary film New World Order 2009.
[01:06:59.817 --> 01:07:08.141]  And Jim has identified, and he's always been accurate in the past, Jim has identified
[01:07:10.529 --> 01:07:12.932]  Builderberg meeting in Spain.
[01:07:13.052 --> 01:07:19.339]  Now I saw people commenting on Infowars.com last week when some were speculating that it was going to be in England or Spain.
[01:07:19.399 --> 01:07:22.262]  Now Jim confirmed it's Spain and he's always been right in the past.
[01:07:22.923 --> 01:07:27.167]  And the Bilderbergs sometimes will rent multiple hotels, put out this info to find out what moles they've got.
[01:07:30.216 --> 01:07:32.118]  People are commenting, well, why don't they just have it in Japan?
[01:07:32.138 --> 01:07:33.719]  Why don't they just have it in Africa?
[01:07:34.139 --> 01:07:38.763]  No, they only have it in Western Europe, the Caribbean, or Canada or the U.S.
[01:07:39.124 --> 01:07:41.606]  They do three years in Europe, one year in the U.S.
[01:07:41.646 --> 01:07:43.648]  Three years in Europe, one year in the U.S.
[01:07:43.688 --> 01:07:48.532]  That's how it's been done since the 50s, and this is the group that set up the European Union.
[01:07:48.972 --> 01:07:51.935]  This is the group that set up this entire system.
[01:07:53.413 --> 01:08:00.857]  And so we're working on getting Jim on, and that'll be coming up in the next segment, hopefully.
[01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:06.621]  I also want to continue with news, but right now let's go back to your calls.
[01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:09.623]  Let's talk to Jimmy in Michigan.
[01:08:09.663 --> 01:08:10.523]  Jimmy, you're on the air.
[01:08:10.543 --> 01:08:12.484]  How you doing today, Alex?
[01:08:12.604 --> 01:08:12.924]  Good, sir.
[01:08:16.438 --> 01:08:20.801]  I talked to Michael Savage, and I finally made it on your show, on your website.
[01:08:20.821 --> 01:08:21.561]  It was amazing.
[01:08:22.702 --> 01:08:28.185]  You're the guy that called in and talked about how they set up the Hattari militia, and now they've released their best evidence.
[01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:29.966]  The guy's like, yeah, the government keeps pushing.
[01:08:30.266 --> 01:08:31.647]  We'll have to fight them someday.
[01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:34.168]  I mean, most Americans have talked like that.
[01:08:34.248 --> 01:08:35.229]  Boom, you go to prison.
[01:08:36.089 --> 01:08:37.750]  Right, I understand that.
[01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:42.393]  And I also would like to point out that Mike Meeks,
[01:08:43.314 --> 01:08:49.319]  Michael David Meeks is one of the guys... I can speak for him because I've known him for over 30 years.
[01:08:49.919 --> 01:08:51.480]  I've broken bread with his family.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:53.061]  He was welcome in my home.
[01:08:53.081 --> 01:08:56.124]  He was going to be best man at my wedding on the 8th of May.
[01:08:57.385 --> 01:08:58.445]  This is my friend.
[01:08:58.505 --> 01:08:59.526]  I've known him forever.
[01:09:00.367 --> 01:09:04.890]  There's no way that he would have ever been involved in any kind of conspiracy like this.
[01:09:05.591 --> 01:09:09.754]  He is the kind of guy that wanted to change things
[01:09:10.424 --> 01:09:12.885]  But he was always doing it in a civil way.
[01:09:13.285 --> 01:09:18.287]  He ran for Republican precinct delegate and became one.
[01:09:18.828 --> 01:09:23.910]  And we've been talking about Ann Norlander for Secretary of State.
[01:09:24.777 --> 01:09:27.319]  Michael Bishop for Attorney General.
[01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:31.602]  We just started digging into the guys that are running... Well look, look, look, look!
[01:09:31.662 --> 01:09:39.227]  The media is saying I'm calling for insurrection and violence when I'm not, as a way to make us the bad guys and let the system have the moral high ground.
[01:09:40.248 --> 01:09:46.592]  And the best evidence they've got is the supposed leader, Stone, and he doesn't say anything you should go to prison for.
[01:09:46.612 --> 01:09:50.355]  I mean, talk show hosts say much more extreme things every day.
[01:09:51.155 --> 01:09:56.357]  And so clearly this whole thing is a setup to create the illusion there's all these violent militias out there.
[01:09:57.178 --> 01:09:57.738]  Exactly.
[01:09:58.238 --> 01:10:06.762]  And Mr. Potok, who's certainly welcome to his opinion, why doesn't he come and talk to one of us?
[01:10:07.643 --> 01:10:10.644]  I'll debate him anytime, anywhere, no problem.
[01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:30.293]  Well obviously they don't want the truth getting out and they want to continue with the illusion that anybody that criticizes the government is a terrorist that wants to murder people while the government uses more and more force against the citizens every day in this country and gets more and more oppressive and sells us on the idea of police dogs attacking old women at the G20.
[01:10:31.334 --> 01:10:45.199]  But I'd like to get your name and number and perhaps have you on as a guest to talk more about the Hattari and maybe get some of the other locals on with you that knew some of these people so we can dispel the propaganda.
[01:10:45.219 --> 01:10:52.922]  But I saw them being set up when that pale horse guy, Sickles, and they admit one of the members is a Fed.
[01:10:52.942 --> 01:10:55.023]  And I don't know who it is, but I've had my suspicions.
[01:10:55.603 --> 01:10:56.023]  Stay with us.
[01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.396]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:10:59.436 --> 01:11:04.783]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:11:05.023 --> 01:11:09.649]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:11:10.049 --> 01:11:15.096]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:11:15.616 --> 01:11:20.300]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:27.766]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:11:27.946 --> 01:11:28.867]  And here's the best part.
[01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:35.432]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:11:35.752 --> 01:11:38.595]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:11:38.935 --> 01:11:40.837]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:11:41.158 --> 01:11:42.078]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:11:42.099 --> 01:11:42.279]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:45.262]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:11:45.742 --> 01:11:47.484]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:03.300]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:06.064]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:12:06.084 --> 01:12:11.750]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:12:12.771 --> 01:12:15.873]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[01:12:15.893 --> 01:12:20.417]  We also have some specials where you get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:23.959]  A new level in production quality and in information.
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:31.905]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:12:32.066 --> 01:12:33.627]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:12:33.907 --> 01:12:34.828]  Everybody needs to get it.

[01:12:45.854 --> 01:12:46.595]  Shadow Government.

[01:12:58.442 --> 01:13:01.065]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:13:01.466 --> 01:13:06.432]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:13:06.792 --> 01:13:08.535]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:13:08.835 --> 01:13:13.661]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:13:13.841 --> 01:13:14.823]  How much do you want?
[01:13:15.043 --> 01:13:15.764]  When do you want it?
[01:13:16.144 --> 01:13:17.745]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:13:18.025 --> 01:13:18.845]  When will you need it?
[01:13:19.085 --> 01:13:21.146]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:13:21.306 --> 01:13:22.406]  Will there be any food?
[01:13:22.626 --> 01:13:23.967]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:29.229]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:13:29.429 --> 01:13:32.550]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:36.511]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:13:36.831 --> 01:13:37.811]  How much will you need?
[01:13:38.052 --> 01:13:38.672]  We don't know.
[01:13:38.952 --> 01:13:39.872]  How much do you want?
[01:13:40.072 --> 01:13:40.792]  All you can get.
[01:13:40.812 --> 01:13:41.833]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:13:42.093 --> 01:13:44.854]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:13:45.134 --> 01:13:46.894]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:13:46.914 --> 01:13:47.834]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:14:00.094 --> 01:14:06.121]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:14:06.722 --> 01:14:09.706]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:14:14.525 --> 01:14:18.028]  Jim Tucker is our guest, definitely under government surveillance.
[01:14:18.068 --> 01:14:19.849]  He's been shot at before.
[01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:21.931]  Shot at at Bilderberg.
[01:14:22.612 --> 01:14:26.515]  I've had the feds come into my hotel and try to set me up for wanting to attack the State Department.
[01:14:27.276 --> 01:14:31.339]  In 2008 it did turn out that Hillary and Obama were at that meeting.
[01:14:31.879 --> 01:14:36.483]  His phone always works great at home, until we call him for an interview and his phone line was unintelligible.
[01:14:36.843 --> 01:14:38.124]  We've got him via cell phone.
[01:14:39.082 --> 01:14:42.706]  Jim Tucker is our guest now.
[01:14:42.746 --> 01:14:45.389]  We really appreciate him coming on with us.
[01:14:45.429 --> 01:14:49.753]  He's always been accurate in the past, but many others haven't been.
[01:14:50.574 --> 01:14:54.338]  But now we have identified where Bilderberg is.
[01:14:55.379 --> 01:14:56.460]  It's a lot of fun as usual.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.702]  The trilateral meeting comes first.
[01:14:58.722 --> 01:15:00.503]  That's Thursday, May 6th to Monday morning, May 10th.
[01:15:25.237 --> 01:15:27.918]  And that will be in Dublin, Ireland.
[01:15:27.938 --> 01:15:32.320]  The jury is in.
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:36.321]  They're staying at Four Seasons Resort, which is a big spa place.
[01:15:37.141 --> 01:15:48.005]  And Bilderberg's meeting is a month later, as a typical fashion, from Thursday, June 3 until Monday morning, June 7.
[01:15:52.959 --> 01:15:53.640]  We're good to go.
[01:16:22.514 --> 01:16:35.283]  The heavy on their agenda this year, which is not at all unusual, unfortunately, is their intentions for Europeans and Americans to pay higher income taxes.
[01:16:36.965 --> 01:16:47.152]  Significantly higher income taxes because of their plan to level the world so that the third world countries' federal living rises.
[01:16:49.389 --> 01:17:13.596]  And so this is what you're getting from your inside sources, and for those that just joined us, Jim Tucker, for more than 30 years has been exposing the highest level of the World Government Crime Council, the Bilderberg Group, 125 of the most powerful people in the world from Western Europe and North America,
[01:17:14.136 --> 01:17:28.457]  Meeting in secret and the information he's released years before things even happen from Bilderberg Proves the fact that they are governing and controlling our planet to a very great extent now
[01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:40.882]  A week ago, you revealed that they are going to push for raising our taxes to the level of France, basically, but to also suppress the third world, but lower us.
[01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:48.786]  And now that's mirrored by Bernanke saying we've all got to pay more taxes, Volcker saying we've got to have value added and carbon taxes.
[01:17:50.246 --> 01:18:02.976]  And all the services are being cut, some police departments are firing half their cops, some sheriff's departments more than half, but the taxes go up like a third world nation, everything goes to the bankers.
[01:18:03.016 --> 01:18:12.363]  Yes, they manipulated the worldwide depression and now they're exploiting it for their own selfish reasons.
[01:18:12.843 --> 01:18:18.047]  They intend to keep it going for at least until late in the year 2011, late next year.
[01:18:19.052 --> 01:18:19.692]  I think so.
[01:18:42.839 --> 01:18:50.303]  He said that to a group of businessmen in Dallas, and their job is being little messenger boys and go out and tell everybody in the world that we need to accept it.
[01:18:50.883 --> 01:18:54.565]  America gets so hungry and so desperate, they'll accept anything.
[01:18:55.065 --> 01:19:06.370]  But yet, he engineered, he and the other boys, engineered the very financial crisis that they're exploiting, and everything's going according to their plan at this point.
[01:19:07.099 --> 01:19:25.089]  Jim, what's it like for you to be laughed at for 20 years with the media saying Bilderberg didn't exist, and now the last 10 of that 30, now they admit open news every day, world government, global constitution, private banks to rule the planet with a global banking constitution.
[01:19:25.429 --> 01:19:27.150]  I mean, now it's right out in the open.
[01:19:28.891 --> 01:19:33.994]  Well, more so in Europe than the United States because the blackout remains
[01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:44.258]  With the major newspapers like the Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, Associated Press, and the broadcast networks.
[01:19:44.818 --> 01:19:57.448]  Now there's been more exposure, as you've observed when you attended the meetings, about independent broadcast outlets like yourself, independent radio, TV stations, independent newspapers, not chain newspapers.
[01:19:58.243 --> 01:20:03.484]  And we had a lot of those reporters out in Chantilly and also a lot in Pitt area.
[01:20:04.184 --> 01:20:20.748]  Anytime they're in the Western Hemisphere, that is Canada or the United States, we get a great deal of reporting from these independent, not from the
[01:20:21.852 --> 01:20:22.293]  We're good to go.
[01:20:36.394 --> 01:20:46.582]  Well, Jim, we're seeing a lot of top globalists now calling for censoring the web, ending net neutrality, and basically restricting free speech.
[01:20:46.742 --> 01:20:47.943]  England just passed a law.
[01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.686]  A lot of other nations are passing laws.
[01:20:50.766 --> 01:20:52.207]  Australia, Italy.
[01:20:53.067 --> 01:20:54.248]  Is that on their agenda?
[01:20:54.268 --> 01:20:59.152]  Because we see globalist spokesmen at Davos, kind of a public Bilderberg meeting, calling for this.
[01:20:59.633 --> 01:21:04.917]  What other intel are you getting from your sources is going to be on the agenda at Bilderberg 2010?
[01:21:08.192 --> 01:21:13.335]  Well, as far as free speech is concerned, they've never had a First Amendment in Europe.
[01:21:13.775 --> 01:21:17.078]  And, in fact, it's a crime to hurt somebody's feelings.
[01:21:19.759 --> 01:21:32.588]  Let's see, in the Netherlands and in England and in France and in Germany and other countries, it is a crime to hurt somebody's feelings.
[01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:54.619]  Of course, in our own country under the First Amendment, I can say the most horrible things about you to you, but if it's not published by, if I'm not saying it to a third party or writing it to a third party, it's not libelous, it's not flatterous, because I've said it only to you.
[01:21:55.179 --> 01:21:59.862]  But they don't have that kind of, never have had that kind of pre-thought.
[01:22:03.383 --> 01:22:05.284]  But you were asking more about the agenda this year.
[01:22:06.224 --> 01:22:06.805]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:22:12.106 --> 01:22:13.347]  What else is on their agenda?
[01:22:13.447 --> 01:22:25.071]  Even as we speak, the International Monetary Fund, as we've reported for it, is still devolved into the World Treasury Department.
[01:22:29.614 --> 01:22:31.015]  They're laying down propaganda already.
[01:22:31.035 --> 01:22:48.266]  Unless we do something to fix our fiscal path, policies that will tilt the curve downward, you'll see these problems come forward, says Ford or Fed economist Michael Mussa, to the Peterson on April 8th, to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in calling for a tax hike here in Europe.
[01:22:49.747 --> 01:22:55.671]  And we're hearing from a lot of characters.
[01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:58.113]  I'm stumbling with my notes here as we speak.
[01:22:59.804 --> 01:23:08.390]  Well, while you dig around in your notes there, and again, Jim's been fighting these people forever, I mean, it's all over the BBC, London Guardian, Times of London.
[01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:16.236]  They say, a planetary government with the IMF and World Bank as the global treasury, and the private banks will govern the planet.
[01:23:16.256 --> 01:23:25.904]  I mean, this is openly being announced, and they say, we're going to raise all your taxes and cut your services, and now Bloomberg reports they're going to take everybody's pension funds and give it to the bankers.
[01:23:26.384 --> 01:23:28.926]  And if you don't like it, they'll just turn Northcom loose on you.
[01:23:31.242 --> 01:23:37.584]  Yes, as I said, in Europe there's a great deal of attention to major newspapers for a lot of years.
[01:23:38.104 --> 01:23:52.908]  In fact, I think I've mentioned so many times before, it was about Helsinki, about 1980-something, and we had in the spotlight the Band-Aid of American Free Press.
[01:23:53.488 --> 01:23:55.929]  We had the story earlier that year, their exact location.
[01:23:56.599 --> 01:24:10.107]  And we got letters from Europe saying, of course our circulation is hardly wall-to-wall in Europe, but it costs so much to send it by mail, so one person could share his paper with 10 other people to help out at a subscription.
[01:24:10.967 --> 01:24:14.529]  So we got letters from leaders saying, should we alert the local media?
[01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:15.930]  And I said, yes.
[01:24:19.028 --> 01:24:31.418]  When Kissinger and the other kids got off the airplane at Helsinki Airport and headed for their limousines, they were stunned to see all those cameras and reporters yelling questions.
[01:24:32.159 --> 01:24:39.986]  And the major newspapers in London and Paris and throughout Europe give heavy page-one attention.
[01:24:40.026 --> 01:24:43.469]  Photographs, stories, raising the same questions we always raise.
[01:24:44.335 --> 01:24:44.976]  I think so.
[01:24:56.636 --> 01:25:17.080]  And again, before they would deny this, but you would get in there, steal their membership list, expose that a global government group is meeting in secret, and the decisions they make there are implemented, and you were saying on the agenda is to continue the global depression so they can consolidate power.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:18.260]  Yes.
[01:25:19.016 --> 01:25:22.598]  We're not going to come out of this until late 2011.
[01:25:24.219 --> 01:25:27.320]  There might be a little perk here and there, as far as digging out.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:27.880]  Nope.
[01:25:28.201 --> 01:25:28.661]  Not at all.
[01:25:29.721 --> 01:25:31.582]  But they do plan to bring us out of it, though.
[01:25:33.563 --> 01:25:35.624]  As soon as they're convenient.
[01:25:36.124 --> 01:25:42.728]  Now, you remember, it was not so many years ago that they decided that we should have a little bit more prosperity.
[01:25:43.948 --> 01:25:44.929]  Stay there, stay there Jim.
[01:25:44.949 --> 01:25:48.572]  We're going to break and come back and talk about how they control gas prices.
[01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:04.711]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:26:05.171 --> 01:26:12.936]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:26:13.277 --> 01:26:21.162]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:26.205]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:26:26.525 --> 01:26:31.248]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:26:31.749 --> 01:26:35.611]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:26:36.111 --> 01:26:37.112]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:28:07.162 --> 01:28:09.383]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:28:09.403 --> 01:28:14.846]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:28:15.267 --> 01:28:21.490]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:27.492]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[01:28:45.858 --> 01:28:47.279]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.360]  It's here.

[01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:27.038]  Again, Jim Tucker has been working for major newspapers since the 40s and 50s, and he travels to these events, he climbs through gutters when he was younger, steals their membership list, proved this group exists, it's the most elite on the planet, now BBC and others have gotten their documents from the 50s when they planned to set up the European Union by stealth, and Jim has sources inside Bilderberg, and absolutely, he said in 2008, when gas was
[01:30:31.636 --> 01:30:32.636]  Okay, more bad news.
[01:30:32.896 --> 01:30:36.738]  Gas prices are going up, possibly over the next two years for $7 a gallon, like they pay in Europe.
[01:30:36.778 --> 01:30:38.558]  And they say so many times, Europeans pay $7 a gallon.
[01:31:00.422 --> 01:31:05.325]  Now, observe that there's a plentiful supply of oil.
[01:31:06.145 --> 01:31:11.568]  We've got more than enough oil coming out of everywhere.
[01:31:12.369 --> 01:31:20.133]  So, there's no rationalization with this supply of oil to raise prices, other than their arbitrary decision to raise prices.
[01:31:20.653 --> 01:31:26.477]  So, sadly, your oil prices are going to be going up.
[01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:29.772]  Uh, quite high in the next year.
[01:31:29.832 --> 01:31:34.775]  And that's from Bilderberg and Queen Beatrix, one of the owners of Dutch Rochelle and BP.
[01:31:34.795 --> 01:31:36.916]  She's one of the chief owners of the Queen of England.
[01:31:37.156 --> 01:31:38.197]  She's the Queen of the Netherlands.
[01:31:38.557 --> 01:31:39.718]  She wants more of our money.
[01:31:40.678 --> 01:31:40.938]  Yes.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.101]  Uh, you'll notice it.
[01:31:45.141 --> 01:31:51.325]  They had the power to do that a few years ago when gas prices were about $5 a gallon.
[01:31:52.583 --> 01:32:13.620]  The, uh, Bill Burkitt said it's time to, uh, bring down the price of gasoline because Joe Sixpack may not get off of his scooter or his small car, uh, if we don't bring prices down right away because once he gets used to that small car or to his bicycle or motorbike, we may not get him back.
[01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:20.446]  And they were able to, uh, bring down the, uh, at that time the price of oil was, oh, something like 140-some dollars.
[01:32:22.316 --> 01:32:24.497]  So what else is on the agenda?
[01:32:45.839 --> 01:32:47.079]  Okay, and that's from your source.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.280]  What other tidbits are on the agenda?
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.461]  What are they concerned about?
[01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:52.101]  What about war with Iran?
[01:32:54.342 --> 01:32:57.283]  Again, they're divided on that.
[01:32:57.363 --> 01:33:06.547]  The Americans and Israelis want to get a war to attack Iran.
[01:33:09.268 --> 01:33:13.911]  Uh, most European Bilderbergs, not all of them, are opposed to invasion.
[01:33:13.991 --> 01:33:15.152]  They want to talk some more.
[01:33:15.172 --> 01:33:23.258]  So, this was a few times they've been, uh, did not speak with a united voice on a single issue.
[01:33:23.278 --> 01:33:30.663]  That dates back to Bilderberg and Trilateral opposing the, uh, U.S.
[01:33:30.723 --> 01:33:33.905]  invasion of, uh, of Iraq in 2000.
[01:33:38.422 --> 01:33:52.534]  Let's see, in 2001, and the Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld, of course of Bilderberg, promised the Bilderberg that it would not invade this year.
[01:33:53.155 --> 01:34:04.965]  So, the other newspapers reporting the wars, including the Martian Post, reporting that the United States would invade Iraq in late summer or early fall, at the latest, of 2001.
[01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:15.783]  We were reporting the oil start until 2002, probably about March.
[01:34:15.823 --> 01:34:16.983]  I read your paper at the time.
[01:34:17.023 --> 01:34:18.943]  It was 2002 they said it was going to happen.
[01:34:18.963 --> 01:34:20.344]  You said no, 2003.
[01:34:20.724 --> 01:34:22.484]  You had to follow the Berlin Wall.
[01:34:23.064 --> 01:34:26.625]  Hundreds of accurate predictions because you've infiltrated and have sources.
[01:34:27.125 --> 01:34:29.665]  We don't get into those modes of getting those sources.
[01:34:30.365 --> 01:34:32.686]  Continuing, what else are they planning?
[01:34:34.741 --> 01:34:38.683]  Well, that's about all the information I have now on the actual agenda.
[01:34:40.324 --> 01:34:43.025]  Of course, we'll be getting more as we work this story down the road.
[01:34:43.825 --> 01:34:51.569]  And a lot of this will be appearing in American Free Press as the next edition goes in next Friday.
[01:34:51.589 --> 01:34:58.051]  Let's see, you kept asking me how people subscribe.
[01:34:59.875 --> 01:35:00.756]  And this is a weekly newspaper.
[01:35:19.574 --> 01:35:21.375]  Yes, please everybody.
[01:35:21.815 --> 01:35:23.196]  Jim, I have one or two other questions.
[01:35:23.216 --> 01:35:25.577]  We're going to come back and give that number out one more time.
[01:35:25.597 --> 01:35:27.819]  We're AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:35:28.219 --> 01:35:29.640]  Jim Tucker is our guest.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.162]  We'll give you that subscription for the hard copy paper.
[01:35:33.342 --> 01:35:35.703]  It's an interesting little paper, a lot of key information in there.
[01:35:36.423 --> 01:35:41.026]  It's been published for decades under another name, and now it's American Free Press.
[01:35:41.066 --> 01:35:45.528]  Jim Tucker is our guest, and I'll try to wring more information out of him straight ahead.
[01:35:45.548 --> 01:35:46.669]  Then to the news.
[01:35:48.711 --> 01:35:51.698]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:55.307]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:58.083 --> 01:35:59.344]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:35:59.384 --> 01:36:04.727]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:36:04.987 --> 01:36:09.590]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:15.073]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:36:15.574 --> 01:36:20.276]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:36:20.797 --> 01:36:22.678]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:36:23.058 --> 01:36:23.458]  We're good to go.
[01:36:45.678 --> 01:36:49.403]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:36:49.923 --> 01:36:54.448]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:36:54.749 --> 01:36:56.851]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:36:58.630 --> 01:37:00.952]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:37:00.972 --> 01:37:03.213]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:37:03.353 --> 01:37:06.135]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:37:06.555 --> 01:37:11.318]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:37:11.658 --> 01:37:15.861]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:37:16.161 --> 01:37:18.524]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:37:18.624 --> 01:37:21.048]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:37:21.408 --> 01:37:23.971]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:37:24.312 --> 01:37:31.922]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:37:32.242 --> 01:37:37.544]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:37:37.644 --> 01:37:40.444]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:37:40.484 --> 01:37:43.925]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:37:44.185 --> 01:37:45.086]  And I got news for you.
[01:37:45.266 --> 01:37:46.566]  You're everyone else.
[01:37:46.586 --> 01:37:47.586]  Invisible Empire.

[01:37:57.913 --> 01:37:59.815]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke, Food Direct.
[01:38:00.035 --> 01:38:05.260]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:06.481]  Congratulations!
[01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:12.866]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[01:38:13.227 --> 01:38:17.991]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[01:38:18.291 --> 01:38:19.172]  Now something fun.
[01:38:19.412 --> 01:38:20.153]  It's springtime.
[01:38:20.353 --> 01:38:28.057]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[01:38:28.277 --> 01:38:29.017]  Here's the plan.
[01:38:29.177 --> 01:38:37.741]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-high bred seeds absolutely free.
[01:38:38.081 --> 01:38:39.962]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[01:38:40.402 --> 01:38:40.582]  Call 800-409-5111.
[01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:43.044]  We're good to go.
[01:39:03.201 --> 01:39:06.045]  We're talking to an icon in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:39:06.065 --> 01:39:16.677]  You have these kings, these queens, the top 30 richest families, all meeting and he's snuck in, he's stolen their minutes.
[01:39:17.018 --> 01:39:18.520]  I've infiltrated, I've covered it.
[01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:21.730]  And it's world government.
[01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.971]  This is the group.
[01:39:23.011 --> 01:39:23.871]  And they tried to deny.
[01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.091]  Oh, there's no secret group.
[01:39:25.131 --> 01:39:26.151]  There's no new world order.
[01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:32.052]  And now, they openly announce, OK, we're going to have a global treasury run by the private banks.
[01:39:32.412 --> 01:39:33.553]  We will levy the taxes.
[01:39:33.573 --> 01:39:38.534]  They've got all their banker spokesmen from England to Europe to Iceland to Greece to the U.S.
[01:39:38.574 --> 01:39:42.334]  saying, we've got to raise your taxes and we're going to cut your services.
[01:39:42.494 --> 01:39:43.775]  Everything goes to the banks.
[01:39:44.315 --> 01:39:49.736]  Remember, they made all this money up out of nothing through the private Federal Reserve System and similar central banks.
[01:39:51.574 --> 01:39:55.800]  They had an article a month ago in all the major papers in Australia.
[01:39:56.681 --> 01:39:59.004]  And the headlines were, in fact pull it up and put it on screen,
[01:40:00.936 --> 01:40:02.978]  Bank heads meet in secret in Australia.
[01:40:03.178 --> 01:40:05.460]  And you list the names, it's all Bilderberg group members.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.641]  So they have other meetings.
[01:40:07.061 --> 01:40:10.884]  But this is their central mafia godfather commission meeting.
[01:40:11.425 --> 01:40:14.647]  I don't want to glaze over this, Jim, and then we're going to let you go, because I know you're a busy guy.
[01:40:16.449 --> 01:40:24.075]  You mentioned on their agenda is the IMF, from your source, this is also now in the news, as the world treasury.
[01:40:24.495 --> 01:40:27.318]  And how angry are they about their Copenhagen treaty?
[01:40:27.958 --> 01:40:32.779]  Were the private banks would levy taxes on us and run our lives being exposed by Climategate?
[01:40:34.219 --> 01:40:41.781]  They're angry if you ever see, hear one word spoken or see one word printed about Bill O'Brien, they're angry.
[01:40:42.181 --> 01:40:45.662]  They're used to, for 20 years, they're used to absolute secrecy.
[01:40:46.082 --> 01:40:53.924]  But their commitment to turning the International Monetary Fund into a World Treasury Department is unabated.
[01:40:55.915 --> 01:41:11.761]  A year ago, in Greece, they came up with that plan to exploit the economic stress around the world to get the world to accept a World Treasury Department, of which the IMF was to evolve.
[01:41:12.261 --> 01:41:17.224]  And they're still committed to that, even though they were frustrated in their efforts to impose it right away.
[01:41:17.244 --> 01:41:20.385]  So, we still have that one to fight.
[01:41:20.825 --> 01:41:21.885]  We're winning it so far.
[01:41:23.764 --> 01:41:24.905]  Let's never stop fighting.
[01:41:47.374 --> 01:41:50.556]  No, I've exhausted the preliminary information I have.
[01:41:50.616 --> 01:42:06.146]  Of course, I'll have a lot more when I get there, because now I'm getting a lot of help not only from European newspapers, but from some of the high officials themselves who have come forward privately to provide information.
[01:42:06.166 --> 01:42:09.488]  So we'll have a lot more as time goes by.
[01:42:13.769 --> 01:42:17.111]  I've just got exhausted the preliminary information I now have.
[01:42:17.611 --> 01:42:18.731]  And you're going again.
[01:42:19.572 --> 01:42:23.854]  So this is 30 plus Bilderberg Group meetings that you have covered.
[01:42:24.594 --> 01:42:24.814]  Yes.
[01:42:26.535 --> 01:42:32.237]  It's gotta be satisfying to go from people laughing at you to now Bilderberg being in hundreds of publications a year.
[01:42:32.257 --> 01:42:35.339]  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
[01:42:36.019 --> 01:42:39.741]  It's gotta be satisfying, Jim, to have worked on this so long.
[01:42:39.761 --> 01:42:40.341]  I couldn't hear you.
[01:42:41.662 --> 01:42:41.862]  Jim?
[01:42:43.744 --> 01:42:44.425]  I can't hear you.
[01:42:45.687 --> 01:42:46.067]  Okay.
[01:42:46.087 --> 01:42:47.629]  Can you hear me?
[01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:48.931]  Jim, we can hear you.
[01:42:48.951 --> 01:42:49.772]  Can you hear us?
[01:42:52.736 --> 01:42:53.757]  I think we have to give up.
[01:42:53.837 --> 01:42:54.498]  I can't hear you.
[01:42:54.518 --> 01:42:55.900]  Alright, let him go.
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:56.641]  Let him go.
[01:42:56.741 --> 01:42:57.382]  Thank you, Jim.
[01:43:00.425 --> 01:43:05.968]  Yeah, Jim's regular phone line, you couldn't even hear him, and then his cell phone, you know cell phones sometimes drop.
[01:43:06.828 --> 01:43:10.911]  I want to say bye to him, but I don't know how he keeps doing it.
[01:43:10.931 --> 01:43:17.815]  I mean I saw him a few years ago at Bilderberg in
[01:43:19.045 --> 01:43:34.481]  Virginia and he'd be trying to get up out of a chair and his hips were hurting him so bad He's a he's a tough old bird, but that guy that guy just keeps going and he has a lot more energy once he gets to Bilderberg, you know, he Didn't chased around by secret police in Greece.
[01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:41.729]  That's some amazing footage That's all covered in in-game blueprint for global enslavement and
[01:43:45.114 --> 01:43:49.518]  Well actually that part, that's Canada and then Istanbul, Turkey.
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.386]  I guess we've got clips of what he's doing in the Obama deception from one of the other Bilderberg group meetings.
[01:43:58.867 --> 01:44:01.549]  Okay, let me now go through a bunch of news that's important.
[01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:09.817]  For those out there that don't understand what net neutrality is, net neutrality is the internet as you know it.
[01:44:11.863 --> 01:44:22.530]  Net neutrality is being able to visit any website you want, you go by internet subscription, and you can visit MSNBC, you can visit InfoWars.com, you can visit BBC, you can visit the Drudge Report.
[01:44:23.791 --> 01:44:34.478]  You can visit your Little League football team website, you can visit a parks and recreation website, you can visit a dentist website, or a doctor's website, or the Easter Bunny's website if you so choose.
[01:44:35.539 --> 01:44:37.040]  Now, here is an article
[01:44:38.354 --> 01:44:44.015]  Out of executive and management briefing, Comcast's win over FCC reignites net neutrality debate.
[01:44:44.556 --> 01:44:54.218]  The most immediate ramification of Comcast's net neutrality victory over the Federal Communications Commission this week is that ISPs might feel less inclined not to interfere in the traffic running over their networks.
[01:44:54.258 --> 01:44:59.779]  However, the implications range well beyond that, coloring every aspect of broadband marketplace.
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:01.600]  Now, this is what
[01:45:03.806 --> 01:45:10.457]  China does, but the government is the big ISP basically, over the ISPs, and it decides what you can visit, what you can't.
[01:45:10.798 --> 01:45:12.040]  And they just put you in a blacklist.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.082]  Australia's doing this.
[01:45:13.903 --> 01:45:14.965]  England's moving to do this.
[01:45:16.246 --> 01:45:20.428]  In fact, here is an article on that front out of cnetnews.uk.
[01:45:21.228 --> 01:45:22.749]  This is a CBS outfit.
[01:45:23.209 --> 01:45:26.151]  Digital economy bill, nine things you can't do anymore.
[01:45:26.971 --> 01:45:28.972]  And it says, download from us.
[01:45:29.052 --> 01:45:31.594]  Download.com is part of the big happy CNET family.
[01:45:32.234 --> 01:45:41.959]  Among the available software and peer-to-peer share filing tools, the bill specifically states that websites such as Download.com can be blocked if they're providing tools that infringe copyrights.
[01:45:42.819 --> 01:45:51.708]  Even legal sites run by CBS that have nothing but legal stuff on there, and they give you tools to download, that isn't allowed in England.
[01:45:54.131 --> 01:45:54.951]  Use WikiLeaks!
[01:45:56.149 --> 01:46:03.052]  Most worrying is that the same clause also specifically allows for blocking sites deemed likely to infringe on copyright.
[01:46:03.092 --> 01:46:10.675]  So, you expose a government document, doesn't matter if the government hasn't challenged it, they say that's government copyright, you won't be able to see WikiLeaks.
[01:46:11.636 --> 01:46:13.637]  And this is all stated, and it goes on and on.
[01:46:14.157 --> 01:46:16.818]  So people need to stop living in denial.
[01:46:16.938 --> 01:46:19.319]  Meanwhile, here's Fox News' Glenn Beck last week.
[01:46:19.579 --> 01:46:20.840]  This is from foxnews.com.
[01:46:23.024 --> 01:46:26.386]  And it says, net neutrality pits free speech against free press.
[01:46:26.466 --> 01:46:36.291]  And he used, in a strawman argument in this article, hundreds of people that have filed with the FCC in briefs for and against ending net neutrality.
[01:46:36.991 --> 01:46:38.012]  Ending the internet as we know it.
[01:46:38.612 --> 01:46:45.636]  And he used one group out of hundreds that's a Marxist, and says Marxists are running this and that we need to get rid of net neutrality.
[01:46:48.917 --> 01:46:49.998]  Meanwhile, Fox News,
[01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:58.155]  Writes articles and calls Homeland Security on me a week and a half ago because somebody made violent comments on one of my message boards.
[01:46:58.436 --> 01:47:06.523]  We went to Fox News and found their own pundits calling for violence against Obama and more violent talk all over Fox Nation.
[01:47:06.803 --> 01:47:08.725]  Needless to say, we did not call the feds on them.
[01:47:09.485 --> 01:47:11.807]  But, look, they want to shut me down.
[01:47:11.847 --> 01:47:12.847]  They want to shut you down.
[01:47:13.127 --> 01:47:14.888]  They want to shut the alternative media down.
[01:47:15.288 --> 01:47:18.610]  Mainstream media is getting their butt kicked by the alternative media.
[01:47:19.211 --> 01:47:20.651]  And Rupert Murdoch has said this.
[01:47:20.771 --> 01:47:23.093]  And they all want to shut down free speech.
[01:47:23.533 --> 01:47:24.814]  They can't deal with it.
[01:47:27.335 --> 01:47:27.895]  Here's another one.
[01:47:27.955 --> 01:47:32.558]  Court rules against FCC net neutrality arrangements and arguments.
[01:47:36.587 --> 01:47:43.110]  Now, meanwhile, while we have all of this going on, here's the Wall Street Journal.
[01:47:45.011 --> 01:47:47.311]  Now remember, I call it propaganda placement.
[01:47:47.352 --> 01:47:50.593]  It's not just Coca-Cola and Pepsi and
[01:47:53.447 --> 01:47:59.150]  Worville Redenbacher popcorn ads that are woven into TV shows themselves and into movies.
[01:48:00.511 --> 01:48:08.315]  When you're watching a movie and you see National Guard billboards everywhere and Spider-Man or whatever, millions were paid for that.
[01:48:08.836 --> 01:48:14.719]  Or on The Apprentice, millions were paid per episode to show Virgin Atlantic signs.
[01:48:16.476 --> 01:48:19.463]  It's not just ads during the ads, it's ads during the show.
[01:48:19.504 --> 01:48:22.651]  That's how all media is now, because people glaze over a lot of the breaks.
[01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:36.219]  Now, tens of billions a year are spent on this, and I've been telling people about it, and Congress has ruled it's illegal, and then the General Accounting Office has said it's illegal, but they don't care.
[01:48:36.259 --> 01:48:41.444]  But now they admit the government is going to be the main advertiser with U.S.
[01:48:41.484 --> 01:48:42.065]  tax money.
[01:48:42.265 --> 01:48:47.550]  They're moving away from product placement, NBC says, to pure behavior placement.
[01:48:48.231 --> 01:48:49.853]  Now, I'd never seen this term referenced.
[01:48:49.913 --> 01:48:51.254]  I called it propaganda placement.
[01:48:51.694 --> 01:48:54.917]  They call it behavior, or I would call it brainwashing placement.
[01:48:55.618 --> 01:48:57.980]  And it says, what your TV is telling you to do.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.184]  And of course, they introduce the fact that you're being propagandized with something that sounds reasonable.
[01:49:02.605 --> 01:49:04.446]  Recycle, exercise, eat right.
[01:49:05.587 --> 01:49:13.295]  But really, it's anti-family, pro-CPS, anti-Second Amendment, pro-torture, pro-surveillance, pro-corruption.
[01:49:14.301 --> 01:49:15.603]  You watch any show, you'll see it.
[01:49:15.623 --> 01:49:17.686]  They're being paid your tax money.
[01:49:18.247 --> 01:49:20.430]  Those shows are financed to brainwash you.
[01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:27.914]  In just one... And that's mainly because people for the last decade or so don't trust mainstream TV.
[01:49:27.954 --> 01:49:31.317]  And all the polls and studies show people trust alternative media even more.
[01:49:31.837 --> 01:49:32.918]  Sometimes I don't know why.
[01:49:32.938 --> 01:49:35.200]  I mean, there's a lot of garbage in alternative media.
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:36.361]  The government's infiltrated that.
[01:49:36.761 --> 01:49:38.122]  They have provocateurs out there.
[01:49:38.762 --> 01:49:42.505]  But the point is, you should be suspect of everything, folks, and do research.
[01:49:42.525 --> 01:49:44.907]  That doesn't mean just be suspect if someone makes a claim.
[01:49:45.267 --> 01:49:46.108]  Go look into it.
[01:49:47.776 --> 01:49:53.639]  But because they know you're not really suspect of TV shows and movies, that's where the real messages are.
[01:50:00.042 --> 01:50:00.742]  And it goes on.
[01:50:00.883 --> 01:50:07.566]  In just one week on NBC, the directives, the detectives on Law & Order investigated a cash for clunkers scam.
[01:50:08.847 --> 01:50:09.347]  A nurse on
[01:50:10.842 --> 01:50:22.969]  Mercy organized a group bike ride, Al Gore made a guest appearance on 30 Rock, and the office turned Dwight into a cape-wearing superhero obsessed with recycling.
[01:50:22.989 --> 01:50:27.012]  See, it's just all brainwashing for peer-pressure-run airheads that watch.
[01:50:27.892 --> 01:50:28.532]  Coincidence?
[01:50:28.773 --> 01:50:29.173]  Hardly.
[01:50:29.193 --> 01:50:36.097]  Now see, we aired the Al Gore stuff at the time a few months ago, and I said on air, I said, that is staged.
[01:50:36.497 --> 01:50:37.658]  That is paid for.
[01:50:37.918 --> 01:50:39.379]  Turns out it is paid for by the government.
[01:50:41.186 --> 01:50:41.866]  It's all paid for.
[01:50:42.887 --> 01:50:49.911]  But now they're saying, oh, we're going to pretty much, except for pharmacy ads and drug ads, we're just even abandoning corporations.
[01:50:49.971 --> 01:50:51.331]  The government is going to fund this.
[01:50:51.371 --> 01:50:58.835]  And remember the FCC head a few weeks ago said, we're going to have government messages and government broadcast systems and government messages and TV.
[01:50:59.256 --> 01:51:00.136]  They've always had it.
[01:51:00.196 --> 01:51:01.497]  Now they're just going full scale.
[01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:03.930]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:05.891]  The tactic, General Electric Co.'
[01:51:05.871 --> 01:51:08.432]  's NBCUniversal calls it, behavior placement.
[01:51:08.852 --> 01:51:15.214]  You wonder why every time in football or basketball they make a goal, at that moment of heightened enjoyment, they cut the troops?
[01:51:16.594 --> 01:51:17.075]  Clapping?
[01:51:17.795 --> 01:51:20.256]  That's meant to say, you like touchdowns?
[01:51:20.276 --> 01:51:21.216]  You like a basket?
[01:51:21.256 --> 01:51:22.436]  You like a hole-in-one?
[01:51:22.817 --> 01:51:23.637]  Troops did it!
[01:51:26.558 --> 01:51:28.458]  Miss America says, I just want to thank the troops?
[01:51:29.379 --> 01:51:29.959]  That's paid!
[01:51:32.179 --> 01:51:34.361]  You wonder why Miss America always praises the UN?
[01:51:34.381 --> 01:51:36.404]  That's been paid for for 50 years.
[01:51:36.864 --> 01:51:38.646]  It's all brainwashing.
[01:51:38.827 --> 01:51:40.128]  And they hand them their talking points.
[01:51:41.590 --> 01:51:43.532]  I heard radio ads for Austin Air Force.
[01:51:43.572 --> 01:51:44.574]  Nothing to do with the military.
[01:51:46.329 --> 01:51:47.469]  This is like 11 years ago.
[01:51:47.509 --> 01:51:48.610]  We have an AXS TV show.
[01:51:48.650 --> 01:51:49.290]  We did Mike Hanson.
[01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:50.630]  I'll dig that out and put it on YouTube.
[01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:55.051]  And they were saying, free emissions testing for your cars in all these locations!
[01:51:55.491 --> 01:51:59.652]  And if you come to get the emissions testing, you know, $10 or whatever it was off your oil change.
[01:52:00.172 --> 01:52:00.872]  So I show up.
[01:52:00.932 --> 01:52:02.573]  I walk over to the head of the Austin Air Force.
[01:52:02.953 --> 01:52:03.713]  And I said, let me guess.
[01:52:03.753 --> 01:52:09.774]  You have a federal government grant, and this is conditioning to prepare the public for new taxes and new emissions testing.
[01:52:10.634 --> 01:52:11.895]  And he said, absolutely, Alex.
[01:52:11.915 --> 01:52:12.495]  That's the plan.
[01:52:13.837 --> 01:52:14.537]  He just laughed.
[01:52:14.577 --> 01:52:28.926]  See, it's this culture of enjoyment that the publishers blind and mindless and mercury's good for me, fluoride's good for me, government my friend, fellow reserve my friend, TV show says so.
[01:52:29.306 --> 01:52:35.429]  I see these cartoons, countless ones, where the kids have microchips, where world government's good, where the UN's the savior.
[01:52:35.970 --> 01:52:36.710]  All paid for!
[01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:39.552]  Going back to Captain Planet.
[01:52:40.332 --> 01:52:41.293]  Ted Turner admits that.
[01:52:43.188 --> 01:52:45.530]  And of course, anybody who has a factory is the bad guy.
[01:52:46.171 --> 01:52:49.174]  That's because the government's going to shut down anybody's factories that they don't control.
[01:52:49.674 --> 01:52:50.455]  This is mafia.
[01:52:50.575 --> 01:52:51.316]  This is a takeover.
[01:52:52.745 --> 01:52:54.307]  The tactic General Electric Co.'
[01:52:54.287 --> 01:53:08.502]  's NBCUniversal calls it behavior placement is designed to sway viewers to adopt actions they see modeled in their favorite shows and it helps sell ads to marketers who want to associate their brands with feel-good, societally aware show.
[01:53:08.622 --> 01:53:11.285]  No, see this article itself is deceptive.
[01:53:11.305 --> 01:53:13.628]  This is all paid for and that's been admitted in congressional reports.
[01:53:13.648 --> 01:53:14.669]  In fact, Google
[01:53:21.052 --> 01:53:23.509]  Government-paid-for news ruled illegal.
[01:53:25.541 --> 01:53:35.246]  I mean, when you see a newscast locally, but it airs in every local affiliate in the country, that mercury is now good for children's brains and has been found to be nutritious.
[01:53:35.286 --> 01:53:39.448]  I mean, that's a real thing that went out from the CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan.
[01:53:39.828 --> 01:53:41.769]  I went and looked it up and it turned out that was a government grant.
[01:53:42.210 --> 01:53:52.035]  CBS was paid money, and this is the big secret with radio and TV stations, the big local marquee station that can put everybody out of business and can't be stopped and has all the power.
[01:53:54.016 --> 01:53:58.081]  When you listen to their news, and even their newsreaders don't know this, it's all given to them.
[01:53:59.263 --> 01:54:00.524]  It's all product placement.
[01:54:01.686 --> 01:54:05.130]  But when it's government, it's propaganda placement or behavior placement.
[01:54:10.134 --> 01:54:13.155]  And on all the shows, the cool woman's on Prozac.
[01:54:13.235 --> 01:54:18.698]  And on all the shows, the cool woman reports the homeschoolers next door.
[01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:19.878]  Why aren't they in school?
[01:54:19.958 --> 01:54:21.579]  The message is homeschooling's illegal.
[01:54:21.799 --> 01:54:23.720]  And then always the homeschoolers are bad.
[01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:24.940]  That's another thing.
[01:54:25.921 --> 01:54:27.762]  Another form of propaganda is on cops.
[01:54:27.782 --> 01:54:28.862]  They only show you the guilty.
[01:54:29.082 --> 01:54:30.763]  They only show you white trash scum.
[01:54:31.043 --> 01:54:33.684]  And the message is cops good and clean, public all evil.
[01:54:33.704 --> 01:54:36.685]  All right, I said I'd get to all this other news.
[01:54:36.705 --> 01:54:37.666]  We're running out of time here.
[01:54:38.641 --> 01:54:54.680]  It's it we live in a total and complete propaganda state and we're one of the few outfits that's gained any prominence that is effective and so the federal government is coming in demonizing
[01:54:57.045 --> 01:55:01.828]  The internet, myself and many others to prepare to curtail it and to shut it down.
[01:55:02.509 --> 01:55:08.313]  And my message to all of you out there is the time to wake up and to realize what's happening.
[01:55:11.745 --> 01:55:17.388]  You're never safe when the government's got police in black uniforms and black masks and there's cameras on street corners.
[01:55:17.668 --> 01:55:20.269]  You're never safe when they're secretly arresting people and torturing them.
[01:55:20.529 --> 01:55:24.030]  You're never safe when foreign banks are looting trillions of dollars a month.
[01:55:24.471 --> 01:55:29.633]  You're never safe when most of the news and TV is paid for government propaganda and they don't even tell you that.
[01:55:29.973 --> 01:55:31.434]  That's not a free society.
[01:55:31.714 --> 01:55:33.114]  It's not cute and funny.
[01:55:33.675 --> 01:55:35.515]  It's danger, Will Robinson.
[01:55:35.916 --> 01:55:36.336]  Danger!
[01:55:37.561 --> 01:55:38.603]  What's Robbie the Robot say?
[01:55:38.903 --> 01:55:40.105]  Danger, Will Robertson.
[01:55:40.185 --> 01:55:40.646]  Danger.
[01:55:40.766 --> 01:55:41.247]  Danger.
[01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:44.812]  This is danger that we're in.
[01:55:45.113 --> 01:55:46.194]  This isn't funny.
[01:55:46.535 --> 01:55:47.696]  This isn't cute.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:58.030]  They're not running drills all over the country with military running real checkpoints in every state in the union because they want to play patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.
[01:55:58.911 --> 01:56:01.073]  Roll him up, roll him up, put him in the pan.
[01:56:01.474 --> 01:56:05.358]  Mark him, prick him, mark him with a B, put it in the oven for baby and me.
[01:56:05.838 --> 01:56:08.081]  Or however that nursery rhyme goes, you know.
[01:56:08.701 --> 01:56:10.764]  This is a fallen republic.
[01:56:12.810 --> 01:56:15.431]  This is a society imploding into evil.
[01:56:16.291 --> 01:56:17.672]  They're getting rid of our borders.
[01:56:17.712 --> 01:56:19.193]  They're staging terror attacks.
[01:56:19.213 --> 01:56:20.313]  I mean, I didn't even get into this.
[01:56:22.974 --> 01:56:23.354]  Here it is.
[01:56:23.514 --> 01:56:28.236]  FCC advisor advocates state-run propaganda megaphone to counter alternative media.
[01:56:28.717 --> 01:56:30.817]  See, we're the enemy of the alternative media.
[01:56:32.018 --> 01:56:34.239]  I want to come back and get into this Half-Life review.
[01:56:36.698 --> 01:56:37.859]  You can see it two ways.
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:40.001]  We're going to play this video for viewers.
[01:56:40.882 --> 01:56:45.426]  It is posted up at InfoWars.com, the video and the text written by Matt Ryan.
[01:56:46.247 --> 01:56:50.310]  It's all up on InfoWars.com right now.

[01:58:03.964 --> 01:58:07.627]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:07.887 --> 01:58:10.109]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:58:10.190 --> 01:58:15.555]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:58:15.995 --> 01:58:22.201]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:58:22.641 --> 01:58:28.184]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[01:59:03.597 --> 01:59:04.017]  Don't!
[01:59:04.457 --> 01:59:07.480]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:59:07.901 --> 01:59:15.027]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:59:15.007 --> 01:59:16.669]  's number one debt secret.
[01:59:16.989 --> 01:59:20.653]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:23.795]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:59:24.195 --> 01:59:31.220]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:32.541]  Herb K. was right.
[01:59:32.741 --> 01:59:35.823]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:59:35.963 --> 01:59:37.004]  What have you got to lose?
[01:59:37.404 --> 01:59:40.386]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:59:40.687 --> 01:59:41.387]  Get Herb K.'
[01:59:41.367 --> 01:59:44.269]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:59:44.589 --> 01:59:44.870]  Call 800-822-1000.
[01:59:47.151 --> 01:59:47.352]  That's 800-822-1291.
[01:59:47.372 --> 01:59:47.412]  800-822-1291.
[02:00:07.062 --> 02:00:11.665]  The Naked Body Scanner Contest has been an incredible success.
[02:00:11.685 --> 02:00:19.710]  We're going to be posting hordes of videos starting today and throughout the week at InfoWars.com of the different entries.
[02:00:19.730 --> 02:00:20.571]  It's just incredible.
[02:00:21.271 --> 02:00:25.294]  We'll be playing some of those throughout the week as well.
[02:00:28.835 --> 02:00:35.240]  More and more, we like to analyze propaganda here on this radio slash TV show multimedia transmission.
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:44.266]  And we know there's product placement and propaganda placement, behavior placement as the insiders call it, going on in video games.
[02:00:44.326 --> 02:00:47.628]  Video games are now bigger than movies, bigger than TV, profit-wise.
[02:00:48.769 --> 02:00:53.413]  And you have some games, tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of people playing simultaneously.
[02:00:53.733 --> 02:00:57.796]  The government's tracking what you do, tracking your psychology, the choices you make.
[02:00:58.436 --> 02:01:03.391]  This is a psychological warfare dictatorship that we live in.
[02:01:05.438 --> 02:01:29.225]  But Half-Life 2 came out a few years ago, and I don't play video games, but people kept sending me emails saying, your show's like Half-Life 2, or it's like Metal Gear Solid, or it's like, and I've gone and looked at all these video games now, and it's all, the government's gonna microchip you, they're putting stuff in the water, they're brainwashing you, they're drugging you, a world government's coming, and people say, oh good, they're fighting the New World Order.
[02:01:31.328 --> 02:01:35.192]  I've talked to some of the game developers now and at the grassroots, they're fans of the show.
[02:01:35.232 --> 02:01:37.614]  In fact, I've been woven into quite a few major video games.
[02:01:38.535 --> 02:01:42.338]  I've even licensed it where they can use clips of my voice in some popular games.
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:46.822]  But the issue is that
[02:01:48.632 --> 02:02:01.297]  This still just serves to condition everybody, so when I then talk about what's being set up in their plan, this Brave New World, this THX 1138 type society, people say, oh, that's just Metal Gear Solid, or that's just Half-Life 2.
[02:02:01.957 --> 02:02:04.598]  We've got a video, Infowars.com reviews Half-Life 2.
[02:02:05.778 --> 02:02:08.580]  By Matt Ryan up on Infowars.com.
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:19.606]  But here's a two-minute video he put together, kind of boiling down Half-Life 2, and everything you see in this video is what the UN and the globalist social engineers say they're planning to set up.
[02:02:19.766 --> 02:02:25.529]  This is how you will live, if they even allow you to live, once their world government is in place.
[02:02:25.769 --> 02:02:31.152]  This isn't fiction, this is reality, covered in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:02:31.333 --> 02:02:31.693]  Here it is.
[02:02:32.756 --> 02:02:34.077]  I don't know how many times I've been relocated.
[02:02:34.137 --> 02:02:36.058]  I never get used to it.
[02:02:37.419 --> 02:02:37.939]  Welcome.
[02:02:38.819 --> 02:02:40.060]  Welcome to City 17.
[02:02:41.801 --> 02:02:47.884]  You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.
[02:02:48.925 --> 02:02:59.891]  I thought so much of City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here, in the citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors.
[02:03:00.686 --> 02:03:03.627]  I've been proud to call City 17 my home.
[02:03:04.727 --> 02:03:13.069]  And so, whether you are here to stay or passing through on your way to parts unknown, welcome to City 17.
[02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:18.310]  It's safer here.
[02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:21.711]  But this stuff, it's all I have left.
[02:03:22.291 --> 02:03:23.031]  All right, I'm moving.
[02:03:23.091 --> 02:03:23.431]  Jeez.
[02:03:24.712 --> 02:03:25.212]  Police brutality.
[02:03:25.232 --> 02:03:26.492]  You're the only ones on that train?
[02:03:32.822 --> 02:03:36.565]  Overwatch stopped our train of thoughts and took my husband for questioning.
[02:03:36.586 --> 02:03:38.647]  They said he'd be on the next train.
[02:03:38.707 --> 02:03:41.210]  I'm not sure when that was.
[02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:45.654]  Did there be nice enough letting me wait for him?
[02:03:45.674 --> 02:03:48.196]  Don't drink the water.
[02:03:48.877 --> 02:03:50.538]  They put something in it to make you forget.
[02:03:50.558 --> 02:03:52.940]  I don't even remember how I got here.
[02:03:55.943 --> 02:03:57.204]  I see they took your suitcase too.
[02:03:57.625 --> 02:03:58.966]  They can't get away with this much longer.
[02:04:00.024 --> 02:04:01.565]  I'm working up the nerve to go on.
[02:04:02.385 --> 02:04:03.345]  Cabreen again?
[02:04:03.365 --> 02:04:06.406]  I was hoping I'd seen the last of him in City 14.
[02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.447]  I wouldn't say that too loud.
[02:04:08.467 --> 02:04:10.087]  This is his base of operations.
[02:04:11.008 --> 02:04:11.528]  Welcome.
[02:04:12.408 --> 02:04:13.668]  Welcome to City 17.
[02:04:32.406 --> 02:04:33.687]  That's what the airports are.
[02:04:33.727 --> 02:04:36.248]  They're training you to live as a slave and training your children.
[02:04:36.288 --> 02:04:37.129]  God bless you all.
[02:04:37.329 --> 02:04:37.849]  Fight back!
