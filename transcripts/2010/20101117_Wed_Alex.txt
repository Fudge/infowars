[00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:09.699]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:11.299]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.840]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.021]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:21.081]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:34.961]  It is Wednesday, the 17th day of November 2010.
[00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:46.191]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast on the economy,
[00:00:46.892 --> 00:00:53.438]  The exploding TSA tyranny and the revolt against it.
[00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:57.942]  We're going to be breaking down what's happening in the Middle East, politics around the world.
[00:00:57.942 --> 00:01:02.305]  Ron Paul's golden opportunity, reports the Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:09.193]  Who better to host the debate over sound money in Congress than the Fed's most persistent critic?
[00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:14.280]  In the next two days, they're going to choose the new leadership for the committees.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.044]  I think he ought to be Speaker of the House, but that's going to go to Boehner.
[00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.469]  But they're talking about Ron Paul being Chairman of the Banking Committee.
[00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:27.587]  So that is obviously a very, very important news and information.
[00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.834]  We're going to be going over that today.
[00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.818]  Also, we reported a few weeks ago...
[00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:38.884]  About USA Today and their breakdown that more federal workers pay tops $150,000.
[00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:51.128]  Under Obama, in just less than two years, they've more than doubled the amount of federal employees that are making over $150,000 a year.
[00:01:51.128 --> 00:01:51.428]  Just incredible.
[00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:09.659]  Compliments this report, members of US Congress get richer despite sour economy.
[00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.060]  See, who's getting richer here?
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.164]  The government and the big private central banks and that's it.
[00:02:17.164 --> 00:02:20.986]  Those are the only divisions in this country getting wealthier.
[00:02:20.986 --> 00:02:23.108]  And what are the two parasitic groups?
[00:02:23.108 --> 00:02:26.370]  Government, and who was big government financed by?
[00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.591]  Who was big government created by?
[00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:32.074]  It wasn't by the welfare mom down the street, as the corporate media likes to tell you.
[00:02:32.634 --> 00:02:36.656]  No, it was by the big mega-banks who own the military-industrial complex.
[00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.758]  That's where most of the money goes.
[00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:41.439]  That's where most of your taxes go now.
[00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.961]  State, local, federal is servicing the debt.
[00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:50.204]  You notice your taxes go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, but your services go down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:53.326]  We're entering the final phase now.
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.401]  of the parasites fully gutting this society.
[00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.623]  So members of Congress get richer despite sour economy.
[00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:08.045]  Federal workers double in the last year and a half.
[00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:11.267]  The number of people getting $150,000 or more a year.
[00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:15.949]  And of course, that's the only major growth sector in the country is the federal government.
[00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.510]  State governments are getting smaller now.
[00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.311]  They're being sucked away.
[00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:25.834]  And after they've bankrupted the nation fully, they're going to get rid of most of the federal government, and it'll just be the international bureaucracy.
[00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:36.754]  See, the global bankers, we've seen them do this in other third world countries, they come in and use big government as their tool of control up front, then they phase it out and leave a broken down,
[00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:55.041]  Society that they can more easily control they use poverty as a tool of control where you've got to be a TSA worker Grabbing grandma's crotch to get your $10 an hour because there's no other jobs You've got to join the military and go fight for the Empire.
[00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:56.822]  This has all been written up in textbooks.
[00:03:56.822 --> 00:04:06.546]  This is all social engineering Imagine the most cold-blooded evil you can and then double that and you've gotten somewhere near the mind of the New World Order
[00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.390]  In fact, I've engaged in an exercise.
[00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.353]  I will imagine the most horrible, wicked thing I can, then search engine it, and I'll find governments doing it out in the open.
[00:04:17.353 --> 00:04:19.394]  Or major corporations are.
[00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:21.175]  They invent evil.
[00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.036]  If you can think of it, they're doing it.
[00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:23.556]  And then some.
[00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:25.421]  Here's another one.
[00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:28.222]  Government employees owe billions in delinquent taxes.
[00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:34.784]  Yeah, I've seen those reports over the years where in some cases half of Congress isn't paying their taxes or is late.
[00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:37.725]  Government employees owe billions in delinquent taxes.
[00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:40.186]  But don't worry, nobody's going to prosecute them.
[00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:44.227]  But BBC, more US households short on food.
[00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:49.573]  Efforts to extend Bush-era tax cuts falter as talks are delayed.
[00:04:49.573 --> 00:04:50.594]  Bloomberg.
[00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:51.836]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:54.639]  The latest on the TSA and a lot more.
[00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.080]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.944]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:04.509]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.070]  Number one.
[00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.673]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.673 --> 00:05:14.576]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:15.316]  It's true.
[00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:21.020]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.602]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:28.304]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:29.304]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.304 --> 00:05:32.066]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:35.747]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:36.527]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:40.669]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.731]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:49.913]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.913 --> 00:05:51.694]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:56.296]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:06:00.078 --> 00:06:03.660]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.961]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:09.364]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:06:09.364 --> 00:06:15.287]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:06:15.287 --> 00:06:17.448]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:06:17.448 --> 00:06:20.130]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.976]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:26.976 --> 00:06:29.177]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:06:29.177 --> 00:06:34.522]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:39.807]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:06:39.807 --> 00:06:44.971]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.352]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[00:06:54.153 --> 00:06:59.914]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:06:59.914 --> 00:07:06.575]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:07:06.575 --> 00:07:11.716]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:07:11.716 --> 00:07:13.837]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:07:15.822 --> 00:07:26.641]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:07:28.803 --> 00:07:33.525]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:37.366]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:07:37.366 --> 00:07:38.586]  Others don't.
[00:07:38.586 --> 00:07:40.747]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:07:40.747 --> 00:07:42.528]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:45.409]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:49.650]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.031]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:07:54.732 --> 00:07:57.113]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:07:57.113 --> 00:07:57.893]  Others don't.
[00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:08.144]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.144 --> 00:08:12.787]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.787 --> 00:08:24.856]  We're going to take a lot of your phone calls today on any issue, any question, any comment you've got, your TSA horror story, what you think about this huge backlash of resistance.
[00:08:26.067 --> 00:08:29.249]  I believe you're going to see this on more and more fronts.
[00:08:29.249 --> 00:08:49.980]  We're seeing protests all over California and many other states as citizens are having their taxes raised, their property taxes increased, their sales taxes increased, they're losing their homes, they're losing their jobs, or they're getting their pay cut, or they're getting their social security cost of living increase cut, and then they find out in small towns
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:59.046]  400, 500, 600, 800, or more thousand dollars a year to city managers.
[00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:01.868]  They're finding out about the fraud.
[00:09:01.868 --> 00:09:14.836]  They're finding out about the double set of books that water districts, school districts, counties, they will tell you about their budget, but that's only the money they're spending as expenses.
[00:09:14.836 --> 00:09:18.579]  They don't tell you about the annual comprehensive financial reports.
[00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:26.580]  Or the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, where they take most of the money and invest it in derivatives.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:39.145]  And that's why CalPERS, the retirement fund out in California, is going bankrupt, because they invested in derivatives and now that money's been stolen.
[00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:47.048]  And so what you have is government bureaucracy, with their pensions going up and their pay going up,
[00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:55.707]  At the federal and state level, some states are actually again starting to implode, and that's a lesson to all these government bureaucrats.
[00:09:55.707 --> 00:10:06.972]  They're going to be fleeced as well, but it's at the expense of everybody else's pension, everybody else's Social Security, everyone else's dollar value.
[00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:12.714]  Everything must be sacrificed on this altar of government.
[00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:21.120]  But only while government is useful to the offshore corporations that are sucking dry or essanguinating.
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.723]  The wealth that is in this country.
[00:10:26.723 --> 00:10:28.644]  The globalists don't just want to fleece you.
[00:10:28.644 --> 00:10:36.931]  They want to render you down to be helpless, domesticated, bankrupt, vassal serfs.
[00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:39.033]  This is the road to tyranny.
[00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:44.778]  This is the road to neo-feudalistic serfdom in this high-tech feudal system.
[00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:47.561]  This technocratic feudal system.
[00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:50.276]  This is their master plan.
[00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:32.543]  Carol Quigley quote just put Carol Quigley quote in talks about controlling both parties but the pair that should pull it up but to paraphrase him and he was allowed into the elites own internal annals to write a unofficial history for them to give to high-level CIA officers and others so they could actually understand what they were doing.
[00:11:33.343 --> 00:11:34.423]  And how it worked.
[00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:39.384]  And he said, look, we want to continue to have two parties, but there's really no difference in them.
[00:11:39.384 --> 00:11:57.208]  There's just a rhetorical rhetoric difference in the different ways they arrange the deck chairs on the Titanic so that people think they're rebelling every election cycle, but our agenda can continue.
[00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:59.429]  And it's that simple.
[00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:01.189]  You know, I talk a lot about the left-right paradigm.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:02.780]  As
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.502]  The argument that the two parties should represent
[00:12:50.433 --> 00:13:01.042]  Opposed to ideas and policies, one, perhaps on the right and the other on the left, is a foolish idea accepted only to doctorine and academic thinkers.
[00:13:01.042 --> 00:13:02.423]  Yeah, but that's only part of the quote.
[00:13:02.423 --> 00:13:08.388]  What you can do is put that full quote in to the search engine and then it's a whole page out of the book.
[00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:11.811]  The book's actually, no, I gave that book to a newspaper writer.
[00:13:11.811 --> 00:13:12.672]  He never gave it back.
[00:13:12.672 --> 00:13:15.314]  We need to buy a new Tragedy and Hope.
[00:13:15.314 --> 00:13:16.815]  I gave that away a few months ago.
[00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:18.076]  I didn't give it away, I said give it back.
[00:13:19.224 --> 00:13:21.045]  Actually, about six months ago, and I haven't gotten it back yet.
[00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:26.108]  I need to call that guy up and say, look here, knucklehead, give me my $50 book back.
[00:13:26.108 --> 00:13:34.653]  Okay, I'm continuing here with this information.
[00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:39.256]  This is all a big joke for these people, and they can find plenty of mercenaries.
[00:13:40.714 --> 00:13:42.839]  Who will just buy into it?
[00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:51.518]  Look, most of these professors and media hitmen and mercenaries that are out there, they all know what's going on.
[00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:56.579]  I mean, don't think that we're smart because we've all figured this out.
[00:13:56.579 --> 00:14:06.089]  They all figured out a long time ago and they said, you mean I get money and power by playing along and I can choose to be part of the left-wing version or the right-wing version?
[00:14:06.089 --> 00:14:07.550]  Where do I sign up?
[00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.314]  You mean I get a big house and a trophy wife with fake breast?
[00:14:11.314 --> 00:14:13.376]  I'm ready to go.
[00:14:13.376 --> 00:14:14.498]  And that's the end of it.
[00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:20.811]  And then once they've sold out, once they're in the system, the wife wants a bigger house, not a smaller house.
[00:14:20.811 --> 00:14:23.155]  And so they start whoring out even faster.
[00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:25.739]  They start selling out even more.
[00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:28.003]  And then they're competing with all the other prostitutes.
[00:14:30.031 --> 00:14:39.777]  And so you get a nation of intellectual reprobate prostitutes, and the race of the bottom is now greased.
[00:14:39.777 --> 00:14:46.400]  The skids to Hitlerian, Stalinistic hell are now complete.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.521]  You're guaranteed.
[00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:57.367]  Once you accept evil and corruption, once you don't have any values, except dollar signs, and the bankers create that out of nothing, they get the whole world for nothing, as Thomas Jefferson said,
[00:14:57.847 --> 00:15:02.172]  You ever let the private banks take over the issuance of currency and credit?
[00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:06.237]  Our children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[00:15:06.237 --> 00:15:16.850]  It's a very simple equation, but we let a Madoff-Kenlay type scam, just through pure fraud, take everything over because the guys are bald-headed and wearing suits and they must know more than we do.
[00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:18.742]  They found the quote.
[00:15:18.742 --> 00:15:20.723]  Let's put it back up on screen.
[00:15:20.723 --> 00:15:34.175]  The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideas and policies, one perhaps of the right and the other of the left, is a foolish idea acceptable only by doctorine and academic thinkers.
[00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:35.376]  Or is it doctinarian?
[00:15:35.376 --> 00:15:36.877]  I can't read from here.
[00:15:36.877 --> 00:15:37.958]  And academic thinkers.
[00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:45.664]  Instead, the two parties should be almost identical so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any
[00:15:46.764 --> 00:15:51.166]  Election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy.
[00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:54.348]  Carol Quigley mentored a Bill Clinton.
[00:15:54.348 --> 00:15:55.569]  And that is a real quote.
[00:15:55.569 --> 00:15:56.349]  Next I'll get emails.
[00:15:56.349 --> 00:15:57.390]  That's not a real quote.
[00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.371]  You could just go buy the book then.
[00:15:59.371 --> 00:16:00.712]  Find out if I'm a liar, okay?
[00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:13.801]  But as I said, we're going to open the phones up here today to Justin Kristol, Wilson, Matt, Chris, and many others on any of these issues.
[00:16:13.801 --> 00:16:30.484]  Obviously, we have not been covering as much financial news, as much police state news, or Middle East news, border news, health news, as I should have often on the last few weeks because this TSA story is so big.
[00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:40.012]  But I think overall that's healthy because if this was a big story like OJ Simpson, I would be ashamed to be involved in it.
[00:16:40.012 --> 00:16:51.083]  Or if this was a big major news cycle story, you know, dealing with Prince Twitley over in England and the, you know, Bimbo, he's now been
[00:16:53.462 --> 00:16:54.423]  We're good to go.
[00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:21.097]  There's no doubt right now it is dominating all of the news cycles.
[00:17:21.097 --> 00:17:24.584]  It is an issue they did not want to be on the front burner.
[00:17:24.584 --> 00:17:25.065]  You've got
[00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:55.809]  From the New York Times, to the Wall Street Journal, to Atlantic Monthly, to Forbes, to the London Guardian, to Mother Jones, left, right, libertarian, populist, you name it, saying it's wrong, it's humiliation, it's slave training, it doesn't protect us from terrorists, it's a fraud, it needs to end, and by the way, the TSA's been lying, saying they don't squeeze our junk, and saying this has always been done, and by the way, they're lying about the radiation dangers, and by the way, they're lying about it being discreet,
[00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.492]  And by the way, I mean, that's all over the news today.
[00:17:59.492 --> 00:18:01.814]  The media is catching them in lies.
[00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:04.216]  Just three days ago in USA Today...
[00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:24.968]  And in other speeches she gave, the head of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who talks like the Godfather, it's not enough that she's a creepy jackboot, you know, weird archetypal jackboot lady, but at the same time she gives these speeches and is like, oh, let me tell you about it.
[00:18:24.968 --> 00:18:29.433]  Never once did you come to my office and have a cup of coffee with me.
[00:18:30.615 --> 00:18:37.503]  Never once did you come to any of our family events.
[00:18:37.503 --> 00:18:39.846]  You never wanted to be involved with us.
[00:18:39.846 --> 00:18:44.472]  You came to this country, you found a paradise, and you didn't think you needed people like me.
[00:18:44.472 --> 00:18:46.254]  But now you do.
[00:18:46.254 --> 00:18:47.355]  Now you do.
[00:18:47.355 --> 00:18:49.678]  We are doing this for your own safety.
[00:18:50.802 --> 00:19:05.457]  We are sticking our hands down your pants and grabbing your testicles and your female parts and your breasts, and we're fondling your 10-month-old to stop men in caves that, well, that took down those towers that day.
[00:19:05.457 --> 00:19:11.222]  I am, and by the way, I'm going to be out of here in a few years, and I got to protect Chertoff.
[00:19:11.222 --> 00:19:13.124]  He's the one that made the order for the machines.
[00:19:14.065 --> 00:19:16.966]  Which people like Alex Jones believe is illegal.
[00:19:16.966 --> 00:19:18.047]  But hey, we run the show.
[00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:18.787]  What are they going to do?
[00:19:18.787 --> 00:19:21.308]  We control the FBI and the Justice Department.
[00:19:21.308 --> 00:19:28.311]  He made the initial orders for the body scanners and now he heads up the company making the money off of them.
[00:19:28.311 --> 00:19:30.452]  But that's not a problem.
[00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:32.133]  That's not a problem here.
[00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:37.896]  So listen, we're going to let illegal aliens rent airplanes and we're going to do whatever we want.
[00:19:38.717 --> 00:19:44.961]  And then we're going to train you like a pimp makes a horse submit.
[00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:45.981]  We're going to do whatever we want.
[00:19:45.981 --> 00:19:48.863]  If we want to put cigarettes out on your necks, we're going to do it.
[00:19:48.863 --> 00:19:50.904]  If we want to do cavity searches, we're going to do it.
[00:19:50.904 --> 00:19:52.145]  Have you figured it out?
[00:19:52.145 --> 00:19:54.466]  We're getting ready to take your pension funds.
[00:19:54.466 --> 00:19:56.127]  We're slapping you around.
[00:19:56.127 --> 00:19:58.908]  We're teaching you that you work for Don Corleone now.
[00:19:58.908 --> 00:19:59.609]  You understand?
[00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:02.877]  Do you have pain from a soft tissue injury?
[00:20:02.877 --> 00:20:05.539]  Would you like to alleviate that pain in 10 minutes?
[00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:10.862]  Science has now figured out how to put healing sound frequencies into a kaolin clay and polymer gel.
[00:20:10.862 --> 00:20:18.227]  Once applied to the area of pain, frequency signals are transmitted to the area of injury that activates the release of prostaglandin hormones.
[00:20:18.227 --> 00:20:23.310]  Your body's own prostaglandin hormones eliminate inflammation and the pain that it is causing.
[00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.453]  The result is the elimination of pain in 10 minutes for 90% of users.
[00:20:27.453 --> 00:20:30.135]  We have thermography pictures to prove its effectiveness.
[00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:40.361]  The only alternatives on the market are topical cooling agents that for many are poor performers, often smell bad, may be oily, and do not activate the body's innate response system.
[00:20:40.361 --> 00:20:46.946]  If you'd like a superior alternative to alleviating soft tissue trauma pain in as little as 10 minutes, please call 888-988-3325.
[00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:47.146]  That's 888-988-3325.

[00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:01.748]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[00:21:01.748 --> 00:21:04.150]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?

[00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:03.816]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:05.257]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:09.241]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:11.984]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:11.984 --> 00:22:13.967]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:16.269]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:26.320]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.563]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:29.563 --> 00:22:32.667]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:22:32.867 --> 00:22:34.788]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[00:22:59.445 --> 00:23:00.487]  Pure water.
[00:23:00.487 --> 00:23:03.211]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?

[00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:12.064]  We're good to go!
[00:23:40.964 --> 00:23:41.444]  I think so.
[00:24:29.187 --> 00:24:31.868]  So I shot him!
[00:24:31.868 --> 00:24:32.789]  Shot him down!
[00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:35.730]  We're going to your phone calls coming up later in the hour.
[00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.250]  I've got to get to this.
[00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:44.153]  Senate Bill S-510, Food Safety Modernization Act, vote imminent, would outlaw gardening and saving seeds.
[00:24:44.153 --> 00:24:46.735]  Now, people are like, oh, they'd never do that.
[00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:47.495]  I've read the bill.
[00:24:47.495 --> 00:24:48.675]  I've read the subsections.
[00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:51.296]  We've had lawyers on, members of Congress.
[00:24:51.296 --> 00:24:54.318]  The way it's written, if they try to interpret it like
[00:24:55.199 --> 00:24:55.459]  I don't know.
[00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:21.029]  And earlier this week, Mr. Pistol and Ms.
[00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:29.370]  Don Carleone Napolitano came out and said openly that we're not doing anything we haven't done for years.
[00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.831]  And technically that was true in lawyer speak.
[00:25:31.831 --> 00:25:39.472]  They've selectively done these strip searches and these rape downs for eight, nine years that I know of, but very selectively.
[00:25:39.472 --> 00:25:40.212]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:25:40.212 --> 00:25:44.473]  Now they do it out in public, lifting dresses, pulling down blouses in public.
[00:25:46.112 --> 00:25:55.208]  And now, I mean this is happening to comedians, to news people, it's happening to women.
[00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:58.895]  They stick their hand completely in your pants and grab your testicles.
[00:26:00.387 --> 00:26:01.788]  And it gets worse.
[00:26:01.788 --> 00:26:04.750]  They aren't even changing the gloves.
[00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:11.213]  So you literally could get venereal diseases like herpes or crabs or gonorrhea from this.
[00:26:11.213 --> 00:26:11.674]  Syphilis.
[00:26:11.674 --> 00:26:13.755]  You're probably not gonna get HIV.
[00:26:13.755 --> 00:26:15.536]  But it just shows they don't care about you.
[00:26:15.536 --> 00:26:21.059]  See, you gotta take your shoes off and walk through where thousands of other people have walked through.
[00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:27.603]  I've seen people walking through leaving wet spots with their infested, sweaty, you know,
[00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:29.075]  Feet.
[00:26:46.853 --> 00:26:51.497]  Oh, last week we were just squeezing through your pants to make sure it's not a bomb.
[00:26:51.497 --> 00:26:52.418]  They put pressure on it.
[00:26:52.418 --> 00:26:53.539]  Let me see.
[00:26:53.539 --> 00:27:00.405]  Now, the hand's got to go in the pants and they put it in the crack in your gluteus maximus.
[00:27:00.405 --> 00:27:02.987]  Let me check that a little bit.
[00:27:02.987 --> 00:27:12.876]  Believe me, if people don't say no now, they're going to have one of their drugged up patsies that the State Department helps get on the plane like the underwear bomber on Christmas Day.
[00:27:12.876 --> 00:27:13.497]  That's confirmed.
[00:27:14.955 --> 00:27:16.435]  On record.
[00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:19.456]  And they're gonna put a hand grenade up there and it's over.
[00:27:19.456 --> 00:27:23.558]  They're gonna say, sorry proctology exams or chest x-rays.
[00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:25.058]  You think I'm joking?
[00:27:25.058 --> 00:27:26.718]  No, I'm not joking.
[00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:29.299]  The sky is the limit with these people.
[00:27:29.299 --> 00:27:31.600]  It's a total act of domination.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.101]  And see, that's why it's so important people are angry.
[00:27:34.101 --> 00:27:37.782]  Because if we have victory on this, we're gonna have victory on every other issue.
[00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:38.582]  Now make no mistake,
[00:27:40.188 --> 00:28:02.853]  I'll guarantee you Homeland Security and these defense contractors that make all this money off this, they're in Yemen right now loading up a fake bomb and a printer cartridge, and if the British like last time test it and say it's not a bomb, Obama will just go out on TV and say, yes it was a bomb, get it straight, and England will go back and go, okay Mr. President, we tested it a second time, it does have explosive material.
[00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:11.118]  And then he can sit up there and grandstand as our daddy, like George Bush did, or like Hitler did after he blew up his own Reichstag.
[00:28:11.118 --> 00:28:24.887]  And if you don't know why governments do this, read Operation Northwoods, or Operation Gladio, or Operation Ajax, or the Army Field Manual that WikiLeaks put out a few years ago, where the Army teaches their Black Op captains and above how to stage terror attacks.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.422]  How to carry out false flags.
[00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:30.024]  You know, you're having trouble in a village.
[00:28:30.024 --> 00:28:32.026]  You want to get the village on your side?
[00:28:32.026 --> 00:28:38.551]  Well, you just get one of the kids and hang them, and then put enemy paraphernalia there, and the village will be on your side, you know?
[00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:41.234]  And look, you're going to save a lot more kids by killing a couple.
[00:28:41.234 --> 00:28:42.115]  Come on.
[00:28:42.115 --> 00:28:43.636]  Do you want all the kids to die?
[00:28:43.636 --> 00:28:45.678]  Or do you want to just kill a few?
[00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:56.135]  See, this is how the end justifies the means, and this is how... Of course, the Army Field Manual just vaguely says how to carry out false flag operations.
[00:28:57.523 --> 00:29:02.406]  But then we've interviewed the special forces officers and others and we know the little tricks they do.
[00:29:02.406 --> 00:29:10.212]  In fact, the former Italian president, who was also the head of intelligence at the time in 1980 at the Bologna bombing, he went public and he said U.S.
[00:29:10.212 --> 00:29:18.257]  special forces commanding subcontractors staged hundreds of attacks, including the Bologna bombing that killed, I think it's 70
[00:29:20.589 --> 00:29:24.312]  Pull up the bologna bombing deaths, because I don't want to get this wrong.
[00:29:24.312 --> 00:29:25.333]  I forget the number of deaths.
[00:29:25.333 --> 00:29:28.535]  I want to say 79 or something, but we'll see if I'm right.
[00:29:28.535 --> 00:29:30.377]  I'm going from memory.
[00:29:30.377 --> 00:29:36.802]  I'm under the weather, so my memory isn't operating at full capacity, full skill, but full power, I guess they'd say.
[00:29:39.178 --> 00:29:42.362]  They said that our government's favorite is blowing up school buses.
[00:29:42.362 --> 00:29:44.264]  Oh, that works so good!
[00:29:44.264 --> 00:29:45.306]  Blow a school bus up?

[00:31:53.242 --> 00:31:53.682]  Thank you!
[00:31:59.394 --> 00:32:03.957]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:03.957 --> 00:32:04.858]  Number 1.
[00:32:04.858 --> 00:32:08.301]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:09.161]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:14.045]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.045 --> 00:32:14.785]  It's true.
[00:32:14.785 --> 00:32:19.669]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:20.490]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:24.072]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.072 --> 00:32:27.775]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:27.975 --> 00:32:28.775]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.775 --> 00:32:31.537]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.537 --> 00:32:35.218]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.218 --> 00:32:35.998]  Number 5.
[00:32:35.998 --> 00:32:40.140]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.202]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.202 --> 00:32:49.384]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:51.165]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.165 --> 00:32:55.767]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:32:56.067 --> 00:32:57.007]  This is our land.
[00:32:57.007 --> 00:32:57.828]  These are our people.
[00:32:57.828 --> 00:32:58.128]  The workers.
[00:32:58.128 --> 00:33:00.889]  The strivers.
[00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:02.409]  The builders.
[00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:28.197]  These are our people.
[00:33:28.197 --> 00:33:31.538]  Who are they?
[00:33:31.538 --> 00:33:34.379]  They are the dark armies.
[00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:38.720]  The dark murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.661]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:39.661 --> 00:33:41.161]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:59.019 --> 00:34:01.001]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:34:01.001 --> 00:34:03.022]  You're also watching at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:03.022 --> 00:34:06.625]  Alright, I'm going to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:34:06.625 --> 00:34:15.411]  I just want to remind folks that you can give the gift of truth and awakening this holiday season, this Christmas season that we're now entering and support
[00:34:16.292 --> 00:34:17.753]  This transmission.
[00:34:17.753 --> 00:34:22.956]  So much of what we're able to do is thanks to your support at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:22.956 --> 00:34:28.539]  You can get a one-month trial membership for $5.95 and read my book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:34:28.539 --> 00:34:29.779]  They're both out of print.
[00:34:29.779 --> 00:34:32.721]  See all of my films in super high quality.
[00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:35.462]  See expanded extras that were not in the films.
[00:34:35.462 --> 00:34:37.684]  See exclusive interviews that we're now posting.
[00:34:38.644 --> 00:35:03.087]  Multiple times, weekly, with my teams traveling all over the country, with people like economist Webster Griffin Tarpley, economist Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a new interview with Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura just this week, Dr. Russell Blaylock going up this week, both of my speeches that I gave a few weeks ago out in Santa Cruz, those are going up right now in the next few days, all at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:03.087 --> 00:35:03.667]  And here's the deal.
[00:35:04.508 --> 00:35:17.214]  It takes about a minute to sign up and create your own username and passcode, and then six people can log in simultaneously with that same username and passcode.
[00:35:17.214 --> 00:35:21.976]  I'd love to give it free to everybody, but the point is you can share this with others.
[00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:33.021]  And so what I suggest you do is give yourself the gift of a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, and give us the gift of financial support, and then give a few of your friends and family the username and passcode.
[00:35:34.163 --> 00:35:39.365]  You don't want to probably have a goofy passcode and username like King Donkey or something.
[00:35:39.365 --> 00:35:41.385]  You probably want to create something simple.
[00:35:41.385 --> 00:35:51.489]  I say that because somebody created as a beta test on a social network we're building, the master administrator King Donkey, and I said,
[00:35:52.469 --> 00:35:54.492]  Once we launch this, you're not going to want to have that name.
[00:35:54.492 --> 00:35:56.555]  I know it's funny, but it doesn't make sense.
[00:35:56.555 --> 00:36:07.429]  The point is, I'm now digressing, you can get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, create your own username and passcode, and then give it in an e-card to some friends and family and say, hey, check this site out.
[00:36:07.429 --> 00:36:09.732]  You can watch this daily radio slash TV show.
[00:36:10.613 --> 00:36:12.334]  You can see all the other films.
[00:36:12.334 --> 00:36:17.018]  You can read these books, scores of other films we've been authorized to post up there.
[00:36:17.018 --> 00:36:19.680]  It's all at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:30.728]  And we're running a special through Christmas where you can buy any of our top best-selling, most informative titles, Endgame, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Invisible Empire that I produced, made by Jason Burmess.
[00:36:30.728 --> 00:36:31.349]  Excellent film.
[00:36:32.634 --> 00:36:41.377]  It's all available at InfoWars.com or simply by calling toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:36:41.377 --> 00:36:48.839]  And it is your purchasing of the books and videos and materials that supports us.
[00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:55.902]  We're not supported by George Soros or News Corp or the Pentagon or product placement or propaganda placement.
[00:36:55.902 --> 00:36:58.903]  We are supported by you, the listeners, and our sponsors.
[00:36:58.903 --> 00:36:59.183]  Okay.
[00:37:00.563 --> 00:37:09.025]  That said, I want to get into the TSA, because this soap opera, this is a soap opera that actually matters, but there's new developments every day.
[00:37:09.025 --> 00:37:17.507]  So I guess that does qualify it as a soap opera, kind of like space opera or something, science fiction tyranny opera, but we're now living through it.
[00:37:17.507 --> 00:37:21.448]  I want to get into the nightmare bill that we thought a few months ago was going to get beaten.
[00:37:22.108 --> 00:37:24.390]  I was listening to NPR this morning.
[00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:37.180]  My wife was making breakfast at 630 in the morning and they were announcing with extreme pleasure that it has a very good chance of passing because they're liberal and they want to protect us from the evil food.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:43.685]  That's why the GMO is all being approved when it's been proven in every major study to be causing organ failure, you name it.
[00:37:43.685 --> 00:37:51.371]  That's why they're not worried about them mining the phosphate derivatives, the plutonium and
[00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:55.673]  Radium isotopes and putting it in our water.
[00:37:55.673 --> 00:38:02.817]  They're all over the news going, oh, the government covered up uranium in the water for decades and other isotopes.
[00:38:02.817 --> 00:38:05.018]  But there's no discussion of why is it in the water.
[00:38:05.018 --> 00:38:08.940]  Because they're dumping it in the stinking water.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:14.003]  As you tell the average yuppie that, they're so cowardly they engage in Orwellian crime stop.
[00:38:14.003 --> 00:38:15.304]  You know crime stop.
[00:38:15.304 --> 00:38:17.245]  Orwell explains it isn't stupid people.
[00:38:18.643 --> 00:38:22.926]  You know, the proletariat, they only care about lotteries and acting cool.
[00:38:22.926 --> 00:38:26.188]  You know, if we're ever going to save society, it lies in the proles.
[00:38:26.188 --> 00:38:29.309]  I tend to agree with Orwell, Eric Blair.
[00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:33.352]  But the inner party and outer party members, the smarter, the more they deny everything.
[00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:36.474]  It doesn't matter if Big Brother says they're always at war with East Asia.
[00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:44.305]  It doesn't matter if the next day they say we've never been at war with East Asia and then back at war the next day.
[00:38:44.305 --> 00:38:53.392]  They take pleasure and energetic enjoyment in not being able to see real issues.
[00:38:53.392 --> 00:38:54.734]  They love it.
[00:38:54.734 --> 00:38:57.336]  And so you try to explain to them
[00:38:59.127 --> 00:39:05.393]  We told you years ago that there's different radioactive isotopes in the water, and it's not natural.
[00:39:05.393 --> 00:39:14.881]  They take the toxic waste from phosphate mining, and that's what they call fluoride, but there's hundreds of chemicals they add, and they just go, uh-huh, the space alien gonna get me?
[00:39:14.881 --> 00:39:16.803]  Little paranoid there, pal?
[00:39:16.803 --> 00:39:18.625]  I'm like, no, no, here's all the documents.
[00:39:18.625 --> 00:39:22.608]  Uh-huh, did you get them from a little green man?
[00:39:22.608 --> 00:39:24.210]  Kind of like Jesse Ventura last week.
[00:39:25.267 --> 00:39:27.468]  Well, I think it's the most important show he's ever done.
[00:39:27.468 --> 00:39:37.012]  By the way, he's scheduled Friday, but the network's setting it up, so I can just call him up at home and get him on right away, but Time Warner's scheduling him on the show, so we'll see if that happens.
[00:39:37.012 --> 00:39:43.095]  But to talk about this groundbreaking JFK episode, that by the way, we got him in contact with E. Howard Hunt's
[00:39:45.114 --> 00:39:46.095]  Son.
[00:39:46.095 --> 00:39:50.838]  Rolling Stone first did the report about, oh, deathbed confession and went with the letter.
[00:39:50.838 --> 00:39:56.302]  Of course, Rolling Stone had also been given the audio and offered the video of E. Howard Hunt.
[00:39:56.302 --> 00:40:02.046]  But I guess that was too convincing, admitting how he ran the operation to kill Kennedy.
[00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:06.909]  But we then broke the audio and video here months after that.
[00:40:06.909 --> 00:40:13.173]  But that's going to be on national TV for the first time ever coming up, amongst other breaking news.
[00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:26.095]  This Friday, 9 o'clock Central, and the hour leading into it will be the re-airing of the FEMA Camp Police Stage Special.
[00:40:26.095 --> 00:40:29.618]  That'll air 8 Central, before the new episode.
[00:40:29.618 --> 00:40:32.159]  And I don't think even the JFK can top it.
[00:40:32.159 --> 00:40:38.144]  I will tell you that, but... Oh, how did I get off into Ventura?
[00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:39.425]  We played this clip a few days ago.
[00:40:39.425 --> 00:40:43.148]  It's up on InfoWars.com if you want to see it.
[00:40:43.148 --> 00:40:45.890]  They go into this congressman and they go, okay, we have this bill.
[00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:49.370]  And HR 645.
[00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:52.172]  And the bill deals... In fact, that's in my stack.
[00:40:52.172 --> 00:40:53.753]  Will you guys pull that from the stack from two days ago?
[00:40:53.753 --> 00:40:55.633]  I want to show it to people.
[00:40:55.633 --> 00:41:00.256]  The Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:41:00.256 --> 00:41:04.718]  And the guy just says, huh, did a space monster come out of a big machine?
[00:41:04.718 --> 00:41:06.139]  Green men?
[00:41:06.139 --> 00:41:10.861]  And he says, well, no, this... And then we have the police doing urban warfare training.
[00:41:10.861 --> 00:41:15.123]  We have the military on video training to put Americans in camps.
[00:41:15.123 --> 00:41:16.364]  I mean, this is all on record.
[00:41:17.816 --> 00:41:18.016]  I don't
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:42:03.276]  and radium and they just they will not listen a little green men gonna get me okay i'ma stop pontificating uh... here and i got your phone calls but but but that's where my frustration comes from is america has gotten disconnected from reality mainly from the age of six months in our crap filled diapers being set in front of the television set and being educated by toucan sam
[00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:12.624]  You know, telling us about Froot Loops and Yogi Bear and all this other stuff.
[00:42:12.624 --> 00:42:14.384]  And so kids don't know what reality is.
[00:42:14.384 --> 00:42:15.624]  They don't know what it's not.
[00:42:15.624 --> 00:42:18.965]  People see millions of simulated murders and acts of violence.
[00:42:18.965 --> 00:42:21.386]  So people now laugh at violence.
[00:42:21.386 --> 00:42:26.207]  People now, I see the reports all the time, will see someone run over and cut in half and they laugh.
[00:42:26.207 --> 00:42:30.808]  Just like if you go to a horror movie and a child's being murdered, people laugh.
[00:42:31.701 --> 00:42:40.485]  You know, old-timers, you know, my grandfathers, if they saw in a Western somebody get shot and blood come out of their mouth, they didn't get upset because they were wimps.
[00:42:40.485 --> 00:42:43.426]  They got upset because they'd seen that in World War II.
[00:42:43.426 --> 00:42:50.369]  They got upset because growing up, if they saw blood pouring out of somebody's mouth, it was real and they had humanity.
[00:42:50.369 --> 00:42:59.333]  And I guarantee you, one of those men could beat up the average tough guy yuppie today who thinks he's tough and could sit there and, you know, watch violence all day and laugh at it.
[00:43:00.219 --> 00:43:08.141]  We've got feelings of empathy when we see a child being hurt, or we see somebody run over in the street, because we understand that could be happening to us.
[00:43:08.141 --> 00:43:11.081]  We have a tribal bond with our fellow humans.
[00:43:11.081 --> 00:43:16.403]  But the system tries to disconnect that.
[00:43:16.403 --> 00:43:23.204]  They try to disconnect that family connection, that human connection, that tribal connection, so we're all isolated.
[00:43:23.204 --> 00:43:27.385]  And so we're all alone, and can be picked off by the scientific corporate board.
[00:43:28.646 --> 00:43:33.030]  We're being domesticated and trained.
[00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:37.395]  You think a farmer wants a breed of chicken that'll attack you and is vicious?
[00:43:37.395 --> 00:43:40.618]  You think a farmer wants a breed of cow that's vicious and will attack you?
[00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:42.099]  No, they breed that out.
[00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:46.483]  Well, we're being socially engineered and having that bred out.
[00:43:46.483 --> 00:43:49.967]  Or we're given fictitious, ceremonial, vestigial,
[00:43:53.476 --> 00:43:59.318]  Unworking, prosthetic sports to put our manhood into and our tribalism.
[00:43:59.318 --> 00:44:06.299]  You know, you get all angry and jump up and down about your team winning or losing and paint yourself up in your team's colors and act like a clown.
[00:44:06.299 --> 00:44:08.680]  That's manly, that's healthy, that's good.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.981]  But you raise your voice about government corruption.
[00:44:11.981 --> 00:44:14.161]  You get upset about tyranny.
[00:44:14.161 --> 00:44:15.642]  Man, that's weird!
[00:44:15.642 --> 00:44:16.242]  That's sick!
[00:44:17.352 --> 00:44:21.413]  This fruitcake gets on the air and reads that we're drinking uranium?
[00:44:21.413 --> 00:44:23.274]  It is so bad that he gets upset about it.
[00:44:23.274 --> 00:44:25.255]  That is sick!
[00:44:25.255 --> 00:44:29.996]  Oh, but look at that young man painted up blue with his belly hanging out, acting like a fool.
[00:44:29.996 --> 00:44:32.337]  That is so healthy.
[00:44:32.337 --> 00:44:34.418]  Mm-hmm.
[00:44:34.418 --> 00:44:36.639]  Mm-hmm.
[00:44:36.639 --> 00:44:39.800]  By the way, it was 85 killed at the Bologna bombing.
[00:44:40.836 --> 00:44:41.816]  By our loving U.S.
[00:44:41.816 --> 00:44:42.517]  government.
[00:44:42.517 --> 00:44:46.338]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Justin in Kansas.
[00:44:46.338 --> 00:44:48.218]  Justin, you're on the air.
[00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:49.459]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[00:44:49.459 --> 00:44:49.999]  I'm good, sir.
[00:44:49.999 --> 00:44:51.579]  What's on your mind today?
[00:44:51.579 --> 00:44:54.220]  A couple things I'd like to talk to you about quickly.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:45:00.062]  I'm from Manhattan, Kansas, where they're building the biocenter, the national biocenter, the one that's replacing Plum Island.
[00:45:00.062 --> 00:45:01.483]  Level four.
[00:45:01.483 --> 00:45:05.784]  Yeah, well, we've already got one here, which made me really curious as to why they're getting another one here.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.123]  Uh, the one we have here is a level 3 already and apparently they're wanting to build something even bigger.
[00:45:36.937 --> 00:45:38.237]  I'm just getting ready to read you that article.
[00:45:38.237 --> 00:45:40.298]  It's here in the Manhattan Mercury, our local paper.
[00:45:40.298 --> 00:45:42.058]  Oh, tell me about it.
[00:45:42.058 --> 00:45:44.899]  The headline here is, Report Won't Hurt Funding.
[00:45:44.899 --> 00:45:46.779]  Labs still have strong support in Congress.
[00:45:46.779 --> 00:45:59.382]  The headline grabbing nature of Monday's National Research Committee report estimating the prospect of foot and mouth disease release from a facility built in Manhattan at 70% will not necessarily impact funding for the facility, sources say.
[00:45:59.382 --> 00:46:01.922]  That's wonderful.
[00:46:01.922 --> 00:46:02.702]  It is wonderful.
[00:46:02.702 --> 00:46:03.983]  It is wonderful.
[00:46:03.983 --> 00:46:04.983]  Please continue with the article.
[00:46:06.371 --> 00:46:16.514]  It goes on to say that basically no matter what happens here, the funding isn't going to be stopped here, and they're building the facility no matter what, so people just better get used to it.
[00:46:16.514 --> 00:46:23.517]  Yeah, we're going to grab your wife's privates and your privates and we're going to build 36 level 4 bio-weapons labs and stick them right in the middle of cities.
[00:46:23.517 --> 00:46:29.899]  Oh, we're going to mail out weaponized flu and 50,000 shipments and have a FedEx truck crash with it.
[00:46:30.539 --> 00:46:35.401]  And we're going to have Baxter Pharmaceutical mix weaponized bird flu with the vaccines.
[00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:38.101]  Thank God somebody caught it before it caused devastation.
[00:46:38.101 --> 00:46:39.482]  That's not the threat though.
[00:46:39.482 --> 00:46:43.763]  GMO corn directly linked in German studies to killing the honeybees.
[00:46:43.763 --> 00:46:44.623]  That's not a problem.
[00:46:44.623 --> 00:46:47.044]  No, no, none of that's a problem.
[00:46:47.044 --> 00:46:54.106]  Releasing genetically engineered salmon that major university studies show will extinct natural sea salmon within 40 generations.
[00:46:54.106 --> 00:46:55.687]  It's a chimera salmon.
[00:46:56.627 --> 00:46:56.847]  I think?
[00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:32.607]  And even if you don't want to believe that Ammar al-Awlaki's CIA, even though he's hanging out at the Pentagon and protected and all the attackers are protected and they're run by al-Awlaki on record, even if you believe all of the official garbage and don't know it's all government-run and that bin Laden's admitted CIA, Tim Osman, codename,
[00:47:33.368 --> 00:47:51.625]  The point is, 36 level 4 bioweapons labs being built in major cities and towns all over the country, and the government admitting there's a good chance the bioweapons are going to get out, and then you find out the government's history of secret chemical and biological testing on the American people, you understand what they're doing.
[00:47:51.625 --> 00:47:54.248]  And yes, they don't care whether we like it or not.
[00:47:54.248 --> 00:47:55.609]  They are training us.
[00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:56.930]  They're trying to break our will.
[00:47:57.631 --> 00:48:01.215]  Where they get to engage in any absurdity they want.
[00:48:01.215 --> 00:48:02.496]  I appreciate your call, Justin.
[00:48:02.496 --> 00:48:03.877]  Here's the article.
[00:48:03.877 --> 00:48:06.299]  This is out of the Global Security Newswire.
[00:48:06.299 --> 00:48:10.003]  He was mentioning another news article locally in his paper.
[00:48:10.003 --> 00:48:15.749]  DHS says 70% chance diseases would escape from mainland Plum Island Biodefense Lab.
[00:48:15.749 --> 00:48:16.870]  Well, what's wrong with that?
[00:48:18.083 --> 00:48:19.224]  You know what a level four is?
[00:48:19.224 --> 00:48:24.327]  It's taking something like smallpox, Ebola, and aerosolizing and making it airborne.
[00:48:24.327 --> 00:48:36.035]  Oh, but what is Dr. Eric Pianca, who's helped graduate so many biologists, who've sent me threatening emails, and I pull up their names, and they're working in bioweapons labs.
[00:48:36.035 --> 00:48:46.781]  Dr. Pianca's a genius, and unlike him, a liberal, who only wants 90% dead, we look forward to the day when the human parasite is removed, signed, and you look the woman up and,
[00:48:47.742 --> 00:48:49.604]  She's in bioweapons and she's smiling!
[00:48:49.604 --> 00:48:54.788]  I got the power!
[00:48:54.788 --> 00:49:00.512]  Airborne Ebola!
[00:49:00.512 --> 00:49:03.334]  Twelve monkeys coming your way!
[00:49:03.334 --> 00:49:05.216]  Enjoy it, yuppies!
[00:49:05.216 --> 00:49:06.297]  They can't wait!
[00:49:06.297 --> 00:49:09.980]  They've got the underground bases and the biggest power trip of all!
[00:49:11.075 --> 00:49:16.759]  It ain't havin' mistresses, it ain't startin' wars, it ain't usin' drugs, it ain't gettin' away with crime.
[00:49:16.759 --> 00:49:24.465]  It's killin' lots of people and playin' God, and they've got a lot of eugenics, fake liberals who just can't wait.
[00:49:24.465 --> 00:49:28.268]  They hate their fellow man, and they want you and your family dead.
[00:49:28.268 --> 00:49:38.236]  And makin' you drink uranium and sodium fluoride, and runnin' disdainful TV ads, and tellin' you mercury's good for your children, cause they think you're such idiots.
[00:49:38.236 --> 00:49:39.617]  Mercury's good for you, honey.
[00:49:41.189 --> 00:49:43.830]  Should I play that for the 300th time here today?
[00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:44.830]  We have a news reporter here.
[00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:49.832]  They probably don't believe me that I have multiple newscasts saying lead and mercury is good for children.
[00:49:49.832 --> 00:49:51.432]  And again, I'm the kook!
[00:49:51.432 --> 00:49:56.273]  I think mercury's bad, because I've seen mercury under electron microscopes in mammal brains.
[00:49:56.273 --> 00:50:00.535]  It's the most deadly heavy metal in the brain, because it causes an electrochemical short circuit.
[00:50:00.535 --> 00:50:03.015]  It doesn't just kill the cells it comes in contact with.
[00:50:03.015 --> 00:50:08.037]  It causes a chain reaction in the electrochemical membranes of the
[00:50:09.432 --> 00:50:14.597]  Salt, water, cholesterol-based conduits of the neuron substructures.
[00:50:14.597 --> 00:50:22.064]  Now, DHS, 70% chance disease would escape from mainland Plum Island Biodefense.
[00:50:22.064 --> 00:50:27.650]  My gosh, if there's a 70% chance it's gonna escape from one outfit, why not build 36?
[00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.232]  I mean, this is wonderful!
[00:50:30.232 --> 00:50:32.474]  Don't be paranoid, there's no problem with this!
[00:50:34.713 --> 00:50:36.554]  An expert panel yesterday said the U.S.
[00:50:36.554 --> 00:50:45.237]  Homeland Security Department has not adequately gauged the potential risks associated with proposed multi-billion dollar infectious disease research laboratory in Kansas.
[00:50:45.237 --> 00:50:51.720]  There are several major shortcomings in the department risk assessment of its planned national bio-agro-defense facility.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.040]  Yeah, agro-defense.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.521]  That's learning how to kill everybody's crops.
[00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:57.902]  Kind of like the CIA's been caught doing over and over again.
[00:50:57.902 --> 00:50:59.183]  We'll be right back with more Your Call.
[00:50:59.183 --> 00:50:59.563]  Stay with us.

[00:51:59.878 --> 00:52:04.841]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:04.841 --> 00:52:05.842]  What have we got?
[00:52:05.842 --> 00:52:08.304]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:08.304 --> 00:52:09.305]  A republic.
[00:52:09.305 --> 00:52:11.947]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:11.947 --> 00:52:14.208]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.208 --> 00:52:16.230]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:17.911]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:17.911 --> 00:52:19.232]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:19.232 --> 00:52:19.833]  Children?
[00:52:19.833 --> 00:52:20.973]  Our education?
[00:52:20.973 --> 00:52:21.814]  Our money?
[00:52:21.814 --> 00:52:25.457]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:25.797 --> 00:52:30.763]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.763 --> 00:52:31.804]  We have the facts.
[00:52:31.804 --> 00:52:32.965]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:32.965 --> 00:52:33.867]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:34.748]  We have common law.
[00:52:34.748 --> 00:52:37.291]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:37.291 --> 00:52:40.234]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.

[00:52:46.116 --> 00:52:47.617]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:47.617 --> 00:52:48.697]  Don't tread on me.

[00:54:00.101 --> 00:54:02.783]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[00:54:02.783 --> 00:54:06.405]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[00:54:06.405 --> 00:54:08.526]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[00:54:08.526 --> 00:54:11.227]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[00:54:11.227 --> 00:54:14.429]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Suma Mathur.
[00:54:17.262 --> 00:54:23.724]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:54:23.724 --> 00:54:30.627]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:54:30.627 --> 00:54:37.429]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:54:46.033 --> 00:54:54.661]  It's completely normal to stick your hands down people's pants so Al-Qaeda doesn't get us and grab people's genitals.
[00:54:54.661 --> 00:55:06.251]  It is completely normal to tell people on the news that mercury is good for their children's brains.
[00:55:06.251 --> 00:55:09.974]  See, they're just testing to see what they can get away with.
[00:55:09.974 --> 00:55:11.696]  And I have other clips where they say, listen,
[00:55:12.895 --> 00:55:15.697]  There's nothing wrong with lead from China and toys.
[00:55:15.697 --> 00:55:16.957]  It's good for children.
[00:55:16.957 --> 00:55:19.079]  And they go, yeah.
[00:55:19.079 --> 00:55:22.341]  And the public just kind of goes, okay.
[00:55:22.341 --> 00:55:28.664]  It's normal for Prudential to steal the death benefits of six million dead and dying vets and to sign a secret deal to do it.
[00:55:28.664 --> 00:55:29.825]  Yeah, that's patriotism.
[00:55:29.825 --> 00:55:35.548]  And if you're not for stealing the vets' money, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:35.548 --> 00:55:39.771]  What, you don't like the Federal Reserve being private and running everything and not telling people where the money went?
[00:55:41.516 --> 00:55:45.858]  You don't want them establishing a world government you pay carbon taxes to?
[00:55:45.858 --> 00:55:50.041]  Well, you must be an evil right-winger.
[00:55:50.041 --> 00:55:52.002]  This is the insanity of these people.
[00:55:52.002 --> 00:55:55.644]  So, hey, what's wrong with some uranium in your tap water?
[00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:58.966]  Everybody knows uranium fortifies bones and teeth.
[00:55:58.966 --> 00:56:01.187]  Of course, it actually gives you cancer.
[00:56:04.096 --> 00:56:08.217]  State of Texas and other states, they're not just covering up that it's there, they put it there.
[00:56:08.217 --> 00:56:10.317]  Of course they've been covering it up.
[00:56:10.317 --> 00:56:12.558]  Why won't the media go the rest of the way?
[00:56:12.558 --> 00:56:16.078]  Because they can't fathom the pure evil.
[00:56:16.078 --> 00:56:20.959]  They're not just covering it up, they're doing it because they like it!
[00:56:20.959 --> 00:56:25.800]  Horrible, ignorant, wicked control freaks only know how to hurt people.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:28.160]  They like it!
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:32.081]  They're the kid in school who likes to pull the chair out from under somebody when they're about to sit down.
[00:56:33.766 --> 00:56:39.188]  They're the people that see someone doing well and gets angry by it.
[00:56:39.188 --> 00:56:41.489]  And good people are blind to this.
[00:56:41.489 --> 00:56:43.449]  So it's time to stop being blind.
[00:56:43.449 --> 00:56:44.670]  It's time to grow up.
[00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:46.870]  Crystal in Tennessee, then I'm gonna hurry through calls.
[00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.671]  Then Wilson, Matt, Chris, Bob, and others.
[00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:51.392]  Crystal, you're on the air worldwide, welcome.
[00:56:51.392 --> 00:56:52.332]  Hi, how are you?
[00:56:52.332 --> 00:56:54.053]  I'm good, welcome.
[00:56:54.053 --> 00:56:57.454]  I have a question concerning the airport.
[00:56:57.454 --> 00:57:00.735]  Have you heard of the vaccine nanotechnology?
[00:57:02.691 --> 00:57:11.499]  Well, I know that they're coming out with pills, pharmaceuticals that have RFID in them to track it through your gastrointestinal tract.
[00:57:11.499 --> 00:57:21.048]  I know that they have developed nanotech tracking and that there's a lot of evidence that they are putting it in vaccines, but not specifically with the airports.
[00:57:22.265 --> 00:57:27.287]  Well, actually, there's an article on Natural News about Bill Gates funding nanotechnology.
[00:57:27.287 --> 00:57:31.748]  Right, and they're saying they're going to spray it in airports so it goes through your system and you don't even know.
[00:57:39.434 --> 00:57:43.777]  Well, I did know that Bill G- and Natural News is a very credible publication.
[00:57:43.777 --> 00:58:04.569]  I know of the 28 things he just funded, it's mosquitoes that forcibly inoculate you, you know, it's all for your own good, and it's UN programs, but he is, of course, part of Planned Parenthood, and his daddy is, and he does say there's too many of us, and we've got to cut the carbon footprint by cutting people, but I knew he talked about releasing vaccines forcibly in the air,
[00:58:05.149 --> 00:58:10.233]  Whether you like it or not, because, you know, fluoride and uranium in the water, whether you like it or not, it's for your own good.
[00:58:10.233 --> 00:58:12.014]  It's for your teeth.
[00:58:12.014 --> 00:58:13.435]  But what's the headline on that?
[00:58:13.435 --> 00:58:15.777]  I didn't know he said in airports.
[00:58:15.777 --> 00:58:19.360]  Well, they're going to learn you, Crystal.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.024]  But, Crystal, what's the headline so I can pull it up?
[00:58:29.316 --> 00:58:29.677]  It is.
[00:58:29.677 --> 00:58:31.338]  I just posted on your Facebook.
[00:58:31.338 --> 00:58:38.244]  It says, um, Gil Gates funds Colbert vaccine and I'll just... Alright, stay there, Crystal.
[00:58:38.244 --> 00:58:39.285]  Get me that article, please.
[00:58:39.285 --> 00:58:43.168]  Gil Gates funds... You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.603 --> 00:58:54.186]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:54.186 --> 00:58:55.488]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:55.488 --> 00:58:59.892]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:58:59.892 --> 00:59:05.837]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:05.837 --> 00:59:07.979]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:07.979 --> 00:59:10.662]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:59:11.002 --> 00:59:17.507]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:59:17.507 --> 00:59:19.708]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:59:19.708 --> 00:59:25.052]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:59:25.052 --> 00:59:30.336]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:59:30.336 --> 00:59:35.500]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.882]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[00:59:41.864 --> 00:59:42.985]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.985 --> 00:59:44.006]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:44.006 --> 00:59:45.967]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:10.011]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:11.613]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.613 --> 01:00:13.155]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:17.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:21.424]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.298 --> 01:00:26.039]  Yeah, Crystal, we've got your article here.
[01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:29.041]  Bill Gates funds covert vaccine nanotechnology.
[01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.303]  I was aware of the program, but it's an interesting article.
[01:00:31.303 --> 01:00:32.624]  So you're saying that concerns you.
[01:00:32.624 --> 01:00:33.464]  Well, yeah.
[01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:39.668]  I mean, they're not going to let you escape the poison water and the poison air and the poison GMO crops.
[01:00:39.668 --> 01:00:41.390]  That's why they've got the new bill.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.982]  Which they openly admit is designed to shut down small family farms and ranches.
[01:00:48.982 --> 01:00:49.603]  S-510.
[01:00:49.603 --> 01:01:00.547]  They've got to make sure that you eat the food and breathe the air they've got for you, because that's why they injected those kids down in Guatemala with syphilis and told them it was vaccines, because the government's good.
[01:01:00.547 --> 01:01:02.748]  Mercury's good and syphilis helps children.
[01:01:02.748 --> 01:01:05.889]  I mean, these are good people.
[01:01:05.889 --> 01:01:07.490]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Crystal.
[01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:08.811]  I mean, why are you upset about this?
[01:01:08.811 --> 01:01:09.691]  Don't you love Bill Gates?
[01:01:12.216 --> 01:01:14.701]  Did Crystal leave us?
[01:01:14.701 --> 01:01:15.342]  No, I'm here.
[01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:17.065]  Okay, Crystal, do you have any other comments?
[01:01:17.065 --> 01:01:18.107]  You said you were concerned about this.
[01:01:19.046 --> 01:01:22.468]  I'm just, you know, it's just really scary because what do us parents do?
[01:01:22.468 --> 01:01:29.213]  I mean, what, you know, we try everything we can do to protect our families and our children and it's just everywhere we turn.
[01:01:29.213 --> 01:01:41.081]  Yeah, what do you do when there's arrogant control freaks that have built a scientific dictatorship and think they're God and walk around smiling at us with their self-fulfilled demonic Cheshire Cat looks?
[01:01:41.081 --> 01:01:42.262]  What do you do about Bill Gates?
[01:01:42.802 --> 01:01:45.743]  When the average yuppie says, oh, isn't he a great humanitarian?
[01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:57.389]  They don't know that he put his money tax-free into the Robber Baron Sherman Antitrust Act written by the bankers, like the Federal Reserve was written to get the bankers and was written by them at Jekyll Island 100 years ago last week.
[01:01:58.109 --> 01:01:59.809]  I mean, how do you explain that to them?
[01:01:59.809 --> 01:02:00.250]  They don't.
[01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.310]  They want to be hurt.
[01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:02.750]  So they will be hurt.
[01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:11.592]  And most yuppies won't know why their kid dies of cancer, or why their hair is falling out at 25, or why they're getting diabetes when they exercise all the time.
[01:02:11.592 --> 01:02:12.813]  They don't want to know.
[01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:17.254]  They want to paint themselves up orange and go to a football game and act like idiots.
[01:02:17.254 --> 01:02:18.534]  So we don't need them.
[01:02:18.914 --> 01:02:28.966]  We are reaching out to the people that do care and are concerned, and we're going to take our government over through the proper means, and we're going to bring the murdering Nazi eugenicists to justice, Crystal.
[01:02:28.966 --> 01:02:29.727]  That's what we're going to do.
[01:02:29.727 --> 01:02:32.990]  We get angry and we warn people, Crystal.
[01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.451]  Right.
[01:02:33.451 --> 01:02:35.193]  And I do, and that's another thing.
[01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.043]  You know, people don't want to listen.
[01:02:37.043 --> 01:02:38.464]  They think, you know, we're crazy.
[01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:43.005]  They think we're... And it just, it just, it just breaks my heart because I want to help people.
[01:02:43.005 --> 01:02:44.426]  I post stuff on Facebook.
[01:02:44.426 --> 01:02:45.846]  I email friends stuff.
[01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:48.847]  And they really just think, you know... We're getting headway though, Crystal.
[01:02:48.847 --> 01:02:51.388]  Just a month ago, you would be laughed at.
[01:02:51.388 --> 01:02:56.510]  And the media said everyone knows that everybody loves the body scanners and pat-downs.
[01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:57.390]  Everyone knows...
[01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:01.833]  Did you hear Napolitano this morning and last night in her speeches?
[01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:04.435]  Everyone is involved to keep the homeland safe.
[01:03:04.435 --> 01:03:05.736]  We're all partners.
[01:03:05.736 --> 01:03:08.237]  Everyone understands this is good.
[01:03:08.237 --> 01:03:09.618]  Everyone understands.
[01:03:09.618 --> 01:03:11.099]  It's a lie.
[01:03:11.099 --> 01:03:13.521]  And so that's meant to target the average weak-minded person.
[01:03:13.521 --> 01:03:14.902]  Well, everyone knows.
[01:03:14.902 --> 01:03:18.184]  Well, everyone knows running off a cliff is fun.
[01:03:18.184 --> 01:03:21.146]  I'm a lemming, you know, off the cliff.
[01:03:21.146 --> 01:03:23.408]  So it's perception management.
[01:03:23.408 --> 01:03:24.489]  It's lies.
[01:03:24.489 --> 01:03:26.971]  Everyone knows Mercury's good for children.
[01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:31.260]  Everyone knows sodium fluoride's wonderful.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.541]  Don't mind all those studies.
[01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:36.143]  Doubling bone cancer and IQ reduction.
[01:03:36.143 --> 01:03:38.744]  Let's not worry about that.
[01:03:38.744 --> 01:03:39.724]  Sweep that under the rug.
[01:03:39.724 --> 01:03:41.105]  Look, Crystal, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:41.105 --> 01:03:42.166]  Don't feel bad, Crystal.
[01:03:43.905 --> 01:03:46.167]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:47.688]  What did Mahatma Gandhi say?
[01:03:47.688 --> 01:03:54.114]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:03:54.114 --> 01:03:59.319]  And so just a month ago, they had all their fake push polls out and stuff.
[01:03:59.319 --> 01:04:08.067]  The way they asked these polls is, would you rather be blown out of the air by Al Qaeda bombs, or be body scanned or be patted down?
[01:04:10.247 --> 01:04:18.652]  There's no... Anwar al-Awlaki, the head of all these bombings, hangs out secretly at the Pentagon, source AP Fox News.
[01:04:18.652 --> 01:04:20.012]  Many think this is staged.
[01:04:20.012 --> 01:04:27.557]  Do you believe we should remove, you know, all of the national security controls so the CIA can't operate in secrecy for over 60 years?
[01:04:27.557 --> 01:04:30.098]  Or do you want to give up all your rights and be radiated?
[01:04:30.098 --> 01:04:33.540]  Or do you want someone sticking their hands down your pants for no reason?
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.701]  See, they don't give you real choices.
[01:04:34.701 --> 01:04:38.443]  It's like, do you want to be murdered or have somebody stick their hands down your pants?
[01:04:39.833 --> 01:04:40.674]  See?
[01:04:40.674 --> 01:04:49.502]  So, they've gone from a month ago, everybody loves it, you're a kook if you don't like it, to now, everybody angry saying, I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it.
[01:04:49.502 --> 01:04:50.723]  No one likes it!
[01:04:50.723 --> 01:04:52.985]  It's like Ceausescu in Romania.
[01:04:52.985 --> 01:04:58.810]  One minute he's God, ten minutes later, him and his ugly wife are machine-gunned up against a wall.
[01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:00.252]  We'll be right back, stay with us!
[01:05:04.528 --> 01:05:05.789]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:05.789 --> 01:05:09.713]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.713 --> 01:05:11.955]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:11.955 --> 01:05:17.820]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:24.046]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:30.447]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.447 --> 01:05:34.628]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.628 --> 01:05:38.909]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:38.909 --> 01:05:44.870]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:48.410]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:50.391]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.391 --> 01:05:50.831]  It's here.

[01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:05.952]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:05.952 --> 01:06:14.813]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:14.813 --> 01:06:19.454]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.454 --> 01:06:30.256]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:30.896 --> 01:06:40.399]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.399 --> 01:06:45.841]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:45.841 --> 01:06:53.324]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.324 --> 01:06:56.085]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:01.286 --> 01:07:05.310]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:08.554]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:08.554 --> 01:07:13.339]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.339 --> 01:07:19.746]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.746 --> 01:07:21.989]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.529 --> 01:07:22.829]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:23.329]  Bernanke?
[01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.710]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:24.450]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:26.091]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.417 --> 01:07:43.559]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:48.704]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:07:48.704 --> 01:08:00.795]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:00.795 --> 01:08:03.557]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.557 --> 01:08:06.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.769 --> 01:08:15.570]  There's a reporter visiting with us.
[01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:16.631]  He's here until next week.
[01:08:16.631 --> 01:08:19.954]  Maybe I'll get him in studio next week if he wants to do it.
[01:08:19.954 --> 01:08:21.976]  Or maybe it's just better to leave it alone.
[01:08:21.976 --> 01:08:26.539]  The powers that be might try to stop the story from being published.
[01:08:26.539 --> 01:08:28.141]  Not that it matters in the final equation.
[01:08:28.141 --> 01:08:29.241]  They can't stop the signal.
[01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:32.324]  Not as long as the signal's transmitting the truth.
[01:08:32.324 --> 01:08:33.945]  But he was telling me a Ceaușescu story.
[01:08:33.945 --> 01:08:36.327]  And I actually heard about his bowling alley.
[01:08:36.327 --> 01:08:40.030]  But that... And the reporter spent a lot of time over there in Romania.
[01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:41.571]  That when Ceaușescu would flip on
[01:08:42.517 --> 01:08:42.838]  Is that true?
[01:08:51.172 --> 01:08:55.134]  in his palace that half of Bucharest would lose its power.
[01:08:55.134 --> 01:08:57.076]  And it's the same way in North Korea.
[01:08:57.076 --> 01:08:58.857]  Have you seen the satellite images?
[01:08:58.857 --> 01:09:01.998]  Guys, pull up the satellite images of North Korea.
[01:09:01.998 --> 01:09:05.761]  Satellite images, North Korea versus South Korea at night.
[01:09:05.761 --> 01:09:09.163]  North Korea, South Korea, satellite images at night.
[01:09:09.163 --> 01:09:14.226]  And here's South Korea just ablaze with energy and life and dynamic freedom.
[01:09:14.226 --> 01:09:16.367]  And the North, there's barely any light.
[01:09:18.513 --> 01:09:21.234]  North Korea could have provided an industrial system.
[01:09:21.234 --> 01:09:25.556]  They made the choice not to as a mode of control.
[01:09:25.556 --> 01:09:34.860]  Folks that have gotten out of North Korea alive have confirmed that most of the public are kept in animal stalls as slave labor.
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:44.664]  And they'll bring a man and a woman together a few nights out of the year, and they even monitor this with doctors, to have sex and produce a child.
[01:09:49.562 --> 01:09:55.167]  Once they've done that, they send the woman to another camp, the man to another camp, and the child to another camp.
[01:09:55.167 --> 01:09:56.488]  Destroying the family.
[01:09:56.488 --> 01:09:58.149]  What did 1984 talk about?
[01:09:58.149 --> 01:10:00.971]  Taking children like you take eggs from a hen.
[01:10:00.971 --> 01:10:02.353]  Yeah, blow it up.
[01:10:02.353 --> 01:10:05.355]  South Korea's right there, dead center in the middle.
[01:10:05.355 --> 01:10:07.917]  That's Japan off to the right there.
[01:10:07.917 --> 01:10:13.222]  China to the north, and Russia is right there as well.
[01:10:13.222 --> 01:10:14.042]  There's North Korea.
[01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:14.743]  Blow it up even more.
[01:10:15.762 --> 01:10:19.083]  Thank you, for presentplanet.tv viewers.
[01:10:19.083 --> 01:10:27.686]  Now, again, look at the lights in South Korea, and then look at the lights in North Korea.
[01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:34.108]  There's maybe six, seven little lights in North Korea, and hundreds and hundreds of lights in South Korea.
[01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:37.411]  Oh, there's people all over that country.
[01:10:37.411 --> 01:10:39.711]  But most of them are living in slave pits.
[01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:41.192]  And that is the globalist model.
[01:10:41.192 --> 01:10:42.992]  That's what they like.
[01:10:42.992 --> 01:10:44.893]  Because that's what they enjoy.
[01:10:44.893 --> 01:10:46.993]  Always pressing on the nerve of power.
[01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:48.354]  Being trampled on.
[01:10:48.354 --> 01:10:51.454]  Trampling and being trampled upon.
[01:10:51.454 --> 01:10:53.215]  That's their religion.
[01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:54.955]  It's their enjoyment.
[01:10:54.955 --> 01:11:03.878]  The collectivist aren't some little, you know, dirty hippie wearing sandals taking mescaline or peyote or PCP or LSD.
[01:11:05.899 --> 01:11:08.541]  That's their little useful idiots.
[01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:11.042]  The collectivist is the George Soros.
[01:11:11.042 --> 01:11:11.922]  It's the Rothschild.
[01:11:11.922 --> 01:11:13.043]  It's the Rockefeller.
[01:11:13.043 --> 01:11:17.366]  They collectivize your wealth to make you dependent.
[01:11:17.366 --> 01:11:19.047]  Let's talk to Wilson in Florida.
[01:11:19.047 --> 01:11:19.887]  Wilson, you're on the air.
[01:11:19.887 --> 01:11:21.988]  Thanks for holding.
[01:11:21.988 --> 01:11:22.409]  Hey, Alex.
[01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:24.470]  It's always great to talk to you.
[01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:26.771]  Good to talk to you, Wilson.
[01:11:26.771 --> 01:11:28.592]  I just want to ask you two quick questions.
[01:11:28.592 --> 01:11:31.754]  The first one is, what's your view on Ayn Rand?
[01:11:34.209 --> 01:11:36.029]  You know, I'm going to be quite frank.
[01:11:36.029 --> 01:11:37.590]  I could never get through her books.
[01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:43.471]  And I could read the encyclopedia and be entertained for an entire weekend.
[01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:45.991]  Literally, I love the encyclopedia.
[01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:47.451]  I just can't read it.
[01:11:47.451 --> 01:11:50.152]  And I don't mean to turn off fans of that.
[01:11:50.152 --> 01:11:58.313]  I'm just not a big fiction person, A. And I'm not really an atheist either.
[01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:02.154]  I mean, I think it has some good ideas, but
[01:12:03.622 --> 01:12:07.165]  It really hasn't shaped much of what I believe or what I stand for.
[01:12:07.165 --> 01:12:12.890]  Now, her idea of the individual being where the real power is at, I totally agree and resonate with that.
[01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:19.555]  I'm more of a Thomas Jefferson type guy, or a Victor Hugo, or a George Washington.
[01:12:19.555 --> 01:12:24.540]  I mean, that's more the philosophy that I hold with.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.500]  What's your view on her?
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:32.146]  I was just intrigued by how well spoken she is and how intellectually
[01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:35.881]  Why she is, but I don't agree with everything she said.
[01:12:35.881 --> 01:12:41.145]  I just think she's good to at least learn from or at least look at.
[01:12:41.145 --> 01:12:43.467]  You know, she shaped some of my views a little bit.
[01:12:43.467 --> 01:12:50.211]  And my final question was, always growing up, I always thought Nelson Mandela was good, like learning in school.
[01:12:50.211 --> 01:12:54.595]  And then I see he's been doing speeches at the United Nations since the 90s.
[01:12:54.595 --> 01:12:56.276]  So I just wanted to ask you,
[01:12:56.883 --> 01:13:00.626]  Why was he doing these speeches at the United Nations if I was supposedly told he was good?
[01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:05.070]  And also, Shea Guerrero, I've seen him do a couple of speeches there and people think he's good.
[01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.992]  So I just want to know why these people, you know?
[01:13:06.992 --> 01:13:10.134]  Alright, let me break that down.
[01:13:10.134 --> 01:13:13.797]  Very complex questions, very complex issue.
[01:13:13.797 --> 01:13:20.383]  Nelson Mandela was in prison for decades, in solitary confinement.
[01:13:20.383 --> 01:13:21.304]  And that will change you.
[01:13:23.229 --> 01:13:33.236]  And the revolution that he'd been involved in when they locked him up in prison, that revolution became successful while he was in prison.
[01:13:33.236 --> 01:13:39.901]  And so they brought him out as a figurehead to kind of lead that transition from the clerk and others.
[01:13:41.892 --> 01:13:48.142]  But the very same financial interests that ran that country before run it now.
[01:13:48.142 --> 01:13:55.433]  They've just removed some of the middle class Afrikaners, you know the Dutch and the British.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:13.308]  The middle class people, they're having their minds taken, they're having their farms taken, and certainly there were abusive things that went on in that system, but it's removed that patronage.
[01:14:13.308 --> 01:14:21.252]  Where, sure, it was an unfair class system, but a lot of those black folks had better standards of living than they do now because there isn't a middle class.
[01:14:22.426 --> 01:14:30.509]  So in the name of revolution, they brought in a communist socialist movement, but the big mega companies for diamonds and gold, they're still there.
[01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:33.490]  They've just cut out the middlemen.
[01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:38.831]  They've just cut out the people that originally colonized it.
[01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:46.474]  And another way to look at it is, Westerners came over here, made deals with natives,
[01:14:47.571 --> 01:14:47.871]  I don't know.
[01:15:09.895 --> 01:15:24.857]  After the settlers are done, and this even happened with the robber barons and the railroads, after the settlers are done killing the Indians to take the land, then the railroads would roll in behind them with Pinkerton men with guns, and they'd say, now you're gonna give us your property or you're gonna die.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:39.183]  See, in the 1880s, 90s, 1900, 1910, 1920, the Rockefellers would send Pinkerton men out to whole towns, and they'd just ride in and burn it down and just shoot everybody in the back while they're running.
[01:15:39.183 --> 01:15:43.163]  There were famous massacres in Colorado, you name it.
[01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:50.465]  So that's all that's happened in South Africa, is they just gave them black puppets instead of white puppets.
[01:15:56.677 --> 01:16:03.344]  And it's just a terrible thing, but no one will deny South Africa is even worse off than it was.
[01:16:03.344 --> 01:16:12.452]  The white middle class that was there should have made a real deal with the actual African people and tried to bring real freedom there, but they didn't do that.
[01:16:12.452 --> 01:16:16.296]  The upper middle classes made deals with the elite and of course got cheated.
[01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:21.273]  And then you were also asking me about Che Guevara.
[01:16:21.273 --> 01:16:25.382]  The fact that Che Guevara got killed tells you that he was legitimate.
[01:16:26.786 --> 01:16:28.607]  That doesn't mean I think he was a good guy.
[01:16:28.607 --> 01:16:30.067]  He was a murderer.
[01:16:30.067 --> 01:16:32.908]  He did a lot of cold-blooded killing in the name of the greater good.
[01:16:32.908 --> 01:16:49.733]  Kind of like our special forces will torture or murder or false flag, because if they don't, well, the commies do it, well, the Nazis do it, well, the Nazis are dealing drugs out of Cyprus, and if we don't deal drugs out of Cyprus, when we take Cyprus over, they're gonna rebel.
[01:16:49.733 --> 01:16:52.234]  Oh, we better help the Taliban grow opium.
[01:16:53.615 --> 01:16:55.557]  Or somebody else will!
[01:16:55.557 --> 01:16:58.239]  See, this is how you give in to evil.
[01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:07.547]  But the fact that they killed Che Guevara once they got a hold of him shows that he was certainly outside of their control system.
[01:17:07.547 --> 01:17:11.971]  Just because somebody speaks at the United Nations, though, does not mean they're bad.
[01:17:11.971 --> 01:17:15.474]  I mean, if they invited me to speak at the UN, I'd go do it.
[01:17:15.474 --> 01:17:18.196]  I've actually been invited to speak at smaller conferences.
[01:17:18.196 --> 01:17:19.057]  They invite everybody.
[01:17:19.912 --> 01:17:25.156]  To try, of any influence, to try to co-opt you.
[01:17:25.156 --> 01:17:32.841]  So, of course, the General Assembly of the UN is nothing but a debating society.
[01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:36.484]  It's not totally useless because you can at least get issues out.
[01:17:36.484 --> 01:17:36.964]  It's the heart
[01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:47.341]  of the UN, the Security Council, that has all the real power and has the veto power.
[01:17:47.341 --> 01:17:49.382]  I mean, who created the UN?
[01:17:49.382 --> 01:18:02.753]  You gotta love Glenn Beck talking about, the UN wants to get us the liberal commies and some little Tides Foundation, oh my gosh, they're the master puppets of it all.
[01:18:02.753 --> 01:18:09.037]  And then meanwhile, the Pentagon created the Department of Defense
[01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:10.771]  We're good.
[01:18:27.256 --> 01:18:39.700]  The General Assembly, if you've ever been to a cattle auction, a stockyards auction, the old-fashioned ones, they've kind of phased that out now, where big agribusiness just sets the price, but back even 10 years ago, we still had, you know, real, real
[01:18:41.869 --> 01:18:43.370]  We're good to go.
[01:19:06.957 --> 01:19:15.082]  And the Asian, the African, the Latin American, the Eastern European leaders, they say, absolutely sounds like a good deal.
[01:19:15.082 --> 01:19:17.764]  And then the UN says, one more little catch.
[01:19:17.764 --> 01:19:20.425]  We want you to make sure you vaccinate everybody.
[01:19:20.425 --> 01:19:22.547]  We've got some special shots.
[01:19:22.547 --> 01:19:26.049]  And it comes out, oh, there was some HIV in that.
[01:19:26.049 --> 01:19:27.310]  Oh, there was some polio.
[01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:29.171]  Oh, there was some syphilis.
[01:19:29.171 --> 01:19:30.412]  It's always an accident.
[01:19:31.903 --> 01:19:32.663]  Even though the U.N.'
[01:19:32.623 --> 01:19:36.144]  's stated goal is forced population reduction.
[01:19:36.144 --> 01:19:37.425]  So, that's what the U.N.
[01:19:37.425 --> 01:19:37.605]  is.
[01:19:37.605 --> 01:19:44.487]  It's a giant whorehouse set up by our criminal government, which is really a model of the British Empire.
[01:19:44.487 --> 01:19:47.748]  The same model of management.
[01:19:47.748 --> 01:19:56.850]  Matt, Chris, Bob, Noah, your calls are coming up that I've got to get into this food safety takeover bill, the TSA information, the latest economic news, and a lot more.

[01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:29.703]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:29.703 --> 01:23:34.266]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:23:34.266 --> 01:23:40.070]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:43.712]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:43.712 --> 01:23:46.434]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:46.434 --> 01:23:51.497]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:23:51.497 --> 01:23:51.798]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:51.798 --> 01:23:53.139]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:14.334 --> 01:24:16.536]  We've got to find our fighting spirit.
[01:24:16.536 --> 01:24:20.559]  We've got to learn to not be bossed around and pushed around and told what to do.
[01:24:20.559 --> 01:24:33.709]  The number one threat in human history is always governments and the power-hungry scum that get control of them and want to use us like we're their little toys, as Bob Dylan said.
[01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:37.011]  You play with my life like it's your little toy.
[01:24:37.011 --> 01:24:37.712]  I'm sick of it.
[01:24:39.079 --> 01:24:41.261]  It's like the Black Sabbath song.
[01:24:41.261 --> 01:24:47.726]  See the generals gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses.
[01:24:47.726 --> 01:24:53.470]  Evil minds at blood destruction, sorcerers of death's construction.
[01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:55.391]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:24:55.391 --> 01:25:02.777]  The worst people get into these positions, as many philosophers and historians have noted, because they want the power.
[01:25:04.013 --> 01:25:19.011]  And once they get it, they start competing with each other and it's a survival of the fittest or survival of the most psychopathic that then gravitates towards the ultimate paramount positions and we get a Nazi Germany.
[01:25:19.011 --> 01:25:20.893]  We get a Maoist China.
[01:25:20.893 --> 01:25:22.174]  And that's where we're going.
[01:25:22.174 --> 01:25:22.895]  Guaranteed!
[01:25:23.803 --> 01:25:26.184]  History is 100%.
[01:25:26.184 --> 01:25:27.744]  Humans don't change.
[01:25:27.744 --> 01:25:30.005]  We do the same things over and over again.
[01:25:30.005 --> 01:25:32.986]  We've got to get off this train now.
[01:25:32.986 --> 01:25:38.668]  And we've got to get angry and focused and dig our heels in and say, no!
[01:25:38.668 --> 01:25:40.769]  I know you're a bunch of terrorist criminals.
[01:25:40.769 --> 01:25:42.710]  I know the Federal Reserve are a bunch of thieves.
[01:25:42.710 --> 01:25:44.770]  It's over.
[01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:46.451]  I don't care what you say about me.
[01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:47.631]  I don't care what you make up.
[01:25:47.631 --> 01:25:48.932]  I don't care what you do.
[01:25:48.932 --> 01:25:49.732]  I know I'm right.
[01:25:49.732 --> 01:25:51.112]  That's the end of it.
[01:25:51.112 --> 01:25:52.173]  And then there's nothing they can do.
[01:25:53.317 --> 01:25:56.081]  Already they're not as arrogant as they used to be.
[01:25:56.081 --> 01:25:58.725]  You can tell the establishment's starting to get scared, which is dangerous.
[01:25:58.725 --> 01:26:01.549]  I'd rather them be full of hubris.
[01:26:01.549 --> 01:26:03.492]  Now they're starting to realize they're not invincible.
[01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:05.234]  That makes them more dangerous.
[01:26:05.234 --> 01:26:07.037]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Florida.
[01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:07.818]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:26:07.818 --> 01:26:08.119]  Welcome.
[01:26:09.045 --> 01:26:09.665]  How's it going?
[01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:10.685]  That was awesome.
[01:26:10.685 --> 01:26:14.706]  I'd like to add to that, the only person that masters over my mind is God.
[01:26:14.706 --> 01:26:18.607]  But you mentioned Glenn Beck a second ago.
[01:26:18.607 --> 01:26:24.529]  I wanted to say I like to think of him as domestic policy and you as foreign policy in this info war.
[01:26:24.529 --> 01:26:27.529]  I don't know, it's just a way of looking at it.
[01:26:27.529 --> 01:26:31.070]  But I wanted to bring your attention.
[01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:33.591]  We are Change Tampa confronted George Bush at
[01:26:34.677 --> 01:26:36.538]  I had his little book tour thing.
[01:26:36.538 --> 01:26:37.799]  Pretty good video to look up.
[01:26:37.799 --> 01:26:42.123]  George Bush confronted on 9-11 truth and war crimes in Florida.
[01:26:42.123 --> 01:26:44.364]  You can find that on YouTube.
[01:26:44.364 --> 01:26:49.408]  Also, give a call to action to all the Info Warriors and We Are Truth people.
[01:26:49.408 --> 01:26:53.511]  You know, get out in these airports and hand out literature and let people know.
[01:26:53.511 --> 01:27:01.797]  Airports are awesome places to, you know, start brush fires on small people and have them spread to all the corners of the world because wherever they're going, they'll take that
[01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:07.300]  That's what's so important about this TSA rebellion is it shows people they have power.
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:08.901]  Look at the effect we're having.
[01:27:08.901 --> 01:27:20.868]  A real issue for weeks is now the number one news item, not the regular baloney that they force-feed us, that they vomit on us, that they regurgitate like parrots onto us.
[01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.689]  But going back to this George Bush thing,
[01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:25.992]  I know, I recognize your voice from calling a few months ago.
[01:27:25.992 --> 01:27:34.242]  You're the guys that have confronted Al Gore and many others, and I love the fact that We Are Change confronts the entire spectrum of these scallywags.
[01:27:34.242 --> 01:27:42.752]  What did Bush, who's trying to rehabilitate himself now that he thinks Obama's so unpopular, Cheney openly said?
[01:27:43.598 --> 01:27:43.758]  That's
[01:28:01.636 --> 01:28:06.238]  On the surface, but at the meat and potatoes level, it's the exact same thing.
[01:28:06.238 --> 01:28:11.360]  And here's Dick Cheney, who I've always called Darth Vader, now literally Darth Vader.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.001]  He has an artificial heart on the outside of him.
[01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:15.362]  Guys, pull up.
[01:28:15.362 --> 01:28:18.903]  Dick Cheney has no pulse from Gizmodo, or maybe it was wired.
[01:28:18.903 --> 01:28:23.165]  And it actually shows this heart pump is a big artificial heart attached to the bottom.
[01:28:23.165 --> 01:28:24.685]  He doesn't even have a pulse.
[01:28:24.685 --> 01:28:26.726]  It's just blood flowing continually.
[01:28:26.726 --> 01:28:30.828]  You've got a ringwraith, Nazgul, undead,
[01:28:32.526 --> 01:28:33.786]  He's so full of evil.
[01:28:33.786 --> 01:28:39.588]  You know, they've tried these on other people and they usually die very quickly because they get depressed over not having a pulse.
[01:28:39.588 --> 01:28:40.708]  The body freaks out.
[01:28:40.708 --> 01:28:42.589]  You don't have a pulse when you're asleep at night.
[01:28:42.589 --> 01:28:47.350]  But they say Dick Cheney's doing great with it because he's such a hateful demon.
[01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:50.391]  Bionic Dick Cheney technically has no pulse.
[01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:53.852]  Scroll down and show this artificial heart he's got.
[01:28:55.819 --> 01:28:59.261]  Okay, then that's not the article that has it.
[01:28:59.261 --> 01:29:00.441]  Show the Gizmodo one then.
[01:29:00.441 --> 01:29:02.522]  I want to show people this artificial heart he's got.
[01:29:02.522 --> 01:29:02.922]  I'm sorry.
[01:29:02.922 --> 01:29:03.663]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:29:03.663 --> 01:29:04.483]  What else?
[01:29:04.483 --> 01:29:05.384]  Tell us about the George Bush.
[01:29:05.384 --> 01:29:05.784]  What happened?
[01:29:06.724 --> 01:29:15.727]  Oh, well, I wasn't there, but I'm a member of the group, but the video shows that, you know, we just started yelling out 9-11 is a job, and he was a war criminal.
[01:29:15.727 --> 01:29:26.890]  They were escorted by police officers who, when told that their job was to uphold the Constitution, they replied that no, that was not their job, which is, you know, kind of ironic.
[01:29:26.890 --> 01:29:28.130]  Yeah, they swore an oath to it!
[01:29:29.107 --> 01:29:29.987]  Yeah.
[01:29:29.987 --> 01:29:35.588]  They were met with special agents who obviously wanted to know who they were.
[01:29:35.588 --> 01:29:38.469]  They said it was funny that they were interested in you.
[01:29:38.469 --> 01:29:41.109]  And they were like, yeah, I'll bet you guys are.
[01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:43.329]  I'd say we're interested in you.
[01:29:43.329 --> 01:29:47.670]  We're interested in how the Secret Service helped kill Kennedy that day.
[01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:50.771]  Good job, my friend.
[01:29:50.771 --> 01:29:52.171]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.171 --> 01:29:54.691]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.691 --> 01:29:57.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.336 --> 01:30:04.879]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:30:04.879 --> 01:30:05.799]  Number one.
[01:30:05.799 --> 01:30:09.222]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.222 --> 01:30:10.082]  Number two.
[01:30:10.082 --> 01:30:14.985]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.985 --> 01:30:15.726]  It's true.
[01:30:15.726 --> 01:30:20.589]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.589 --> 01:30:21.429]  Number three.
[01:30:21.429 --> 01:30:25.012]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.012 --> 01:30:28.714]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.914 --> 01:30:29.714]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.714 --> 01:30:32.455]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.455 --> 01:30:36.157]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.157 --> 01:30:36.937]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.937 --> 01:30:41.079]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.079 --> 01:30:46.141]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:50.302]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.302 --> 01:30:52.103]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:30:57.965 --> 01:31:04.288]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:31:04.288 --> 01:31:10.690]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:18.093]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:18.093 --> 01:31:22.635]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:31:22.955 --> 01:31:31.618]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:31:31.618 --> 01:31:35.360]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:31:35.871 --> 01:31:42.632]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:42.632 --> 01:31:46.533]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:31:46.533 --> 01:31:52.895]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:31:52.895 --> 01:31:54.135]  Thank you.
[01:31:59.966 --> 01:32:04.050]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:33:03.695 --> 01:33:05.597]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:05.597 --> 01:33:06.978]  A lie!
[01:33:06.978 --> 01:33:08.960]  No man is obsolete!
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.842]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:10.842 --> 01:33:14.106]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:33:14.106 --> 01:33:19.551]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:33:19.551 --> 01:33:21.233]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:21.233 --> 01:33:22.734]  A crawling insect!
[01:33:22.734 --> 01:33:26.799]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:33:27.399 --> 01:33:28.901]  I am a human being.
[01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:36.649]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind.
[01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:37.790]  I don't care.
[01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:38.851]  I tell you, I don't care.
[01:33:38.851 --> 01:33:40.392]  I'm a human being.
[01:33:40.392 --> 01:33:41.033]  I exist.
[01:33:41.033 --> 01:33:43.556]  And if I speak one thought aloud,
[01:33:44.366 --> 01:33:48.087]  That thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:33:48.087 --> 01:33:51.229]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:58.952]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:33:58.952 --> 01:34:05.994]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and mistake has no use for your kind!
[01:34:05.994 --> 01:34:10.076]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:10.076 --> 01:34:11.797]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:15.805 --> 01:34:22.650]  We are back live, continuing with your phone calls, and I'm going to start hammering into the news here in just a few minutes.
[01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:31.497]  But you notice they always tell you, yeah, we're going to build 36 level 4 bioweapons labs, yeah, there's a 70% chance it's going to get out and kill you, we're doing it anyways.
[01:34:31.497 --> 01:34:34.899]  Yeah, we're going to stick our hands down your pants.
[01:34:34.899 --> 01:34:37.361]  Oh, you don't like us feeling through your pants?
[01:34:37.361 --> 01:34:39.963]  How about down your pants?
[01:34:39.963 --> 01:34:42.465]  Always more, more, more.
[01:34:42.465 --> 01:34:44.606]  Every time you give in, they want more, more, more.
[01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:47.879]  Well, I want more freedom.
[01:34:47.879 --> 01:34:48.840]  I want more liberty.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.222]  I want you out of my life.
[01:34:51.222 --> 01:34:57.787]  And we're pushing back and we're having victories against the control freak armies.
[01:34:57.787 --> 01:34:58.948]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:34:58.948 --> 01:35:08.096]  Well, since we mentioned it for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and radio listeners, you can just type in Dick Cheney has no pulse and look at it, but let's put that graphic back up of the heart pump.
[01:35:11.004 --> 01:35:13.664]  Yeah, I was gonna do heart pump first and then the video.
[01:35:13.664 --> 01:35:14.645]  There's the heart pump.
[01:35:14.645 --> 01:35:17.605]  Dick Cheney has no pulse, literally.
[01:35:17.605 --> 01:35:21.066]  Once you have this, they found that artificial hearts don't work as well.
[01:35:21.066 --> 01:35:25.066]  It's just still using the old heart kind of as the bag.
[01:35:25.066 --> 01:35:36.068]  And then they have a high-powered pump, and you got a battery on the outside like a cyborg, and a pump that's mounted down in your guts with plugs coming out of your side.
[01:35:36.068 --> 01:35:37.709]  I mean, literally Darth Vader.
[01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:40.209]  Dick Cheney is a full-bore cyborg.
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:45.831]  You know, they got these scientists that'll attach a microchip to their finger, put one in their brain.
[01:35:45.831 --> 01:35:47.074]  That's not a cyborg.
[01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:48.899]  When you are literally living...
[01:35:49.775 --> 01:35:58.339]  Because core parts of your body are electropowered by machines, and you've got a pump in your heart.
[01:35:58.339 --> 01:35:59.320]  You're a cyborg.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.441]  I mean, this is 21st century.
[01:36:01.441 --> 01:36:15.608]  We've got a crazy vice president hobbling around, talking about how wonderful George W. Bush is and how real he is, when he's well known for disdaining his employees, disdaining people around him as minions.
[01:36:16.468 --> 01:36:26.872]  On countless TV shows, he'll lean over when somebody isn't looking and clean his glasses on their shirt, or on Bill Clinton's coat, cleaning his glasses in Haiti.
[01:36:26.872 --> 01:36:33.734]  He has nicknames for everyone that they're human feces.
[01:36:33.734 --> 01:36:38.036]  I mean, he's a monster, who says, you bet I ordered torture!
[01:36:38.036 --> 01:36:42.697]  Meanwhile, the people that got caught following his orders are in prison.
[01:36:42.697 --> 01:36:43.478]  I mean, this guy is...
[01:36:46.223 --> 01:36:47.904]  He's horrible.
[01:36:47.904 --> 01:36:50.606]  And meanwhile, Dick Cheney's saying how great he is.
[01:36:50.606 --> 01:36:54.688]  A corpse, a undead zombie.
[01:36:54.688 --> 01:36:57.550]  We have a former vice president.
[01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:58.110]  We are in 2010.
[01:36:58.110 --> 01:37:03.773]  We now have undead zombies giving speeches on television.
[01:37:03.773 --> 01:37:05.494]  I mean, look at Cheney.
[01:37:05.494 --> 01:37:07.055]  His latest speech, I watched it.
[01:37:07.055 --> 01:37:08.496]  He looks like an undead zombie.
[01:37:08.496 --> 01:37:09.817]  He is an undead zombie.
[01:37:11.394 --> 01:37:20.539]  They admit everywhere Cheney goes, they have at least two ambulances and two heart surgeons and experts driving around behind him.
[01:37:20.539 --> 01:37:23.921]  That's the elite in this country.
[01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:32.425]  You talk about Ceausescu having a palace that took so much power that when he flipped the lights on at night, half of the capital city would lose power.
[01:37:32.425 --> 01:37:33.586]  What about Cheney?
[01:37:33.586 --> 01:37:37.428]  In some cases, he has four ambulances following him around.
[01:37:37.428 --> 01:37:38.669]  He's got a robot heart.
[01:37:39.827 --> 01:37:41.207]  I mean, this is all crazy!
[01:37:41.207 --> 01:37:44.308]  We're living in la-la land here!
[01:37:44.308 --> 01:37:59.451]  And the globalists are destroying their own nest with all these open-air, cross-species, genetically engineered... I remember 10 years ago talking about how they're engineering mice with human brains, how they're engineering goats that create body armor.
[01:37:59.451 --> 01:38:01.812]  I actually covered that 15 years ago in their utters.
[01:38:02.692 --> 01:38:05.554]  How they're creating all these crops that have insect genes.
[01:38:05.554 --> 01:38:07.456]  It's now jumping into other crops.
[01:38:07.456 --> 01:38:09.517]  It's causing unbelievable devastation.
[01:38:09.517 --> 01:38:14.581]  When you eat these foods, it then triggers allergies to normal things.
[01:38:14.581 --> 01:38:15.882]  We're killing ourselves!
[01:38:15.882 --> 01:38:19.124]  The elites are killing themselves!
[01:38:19.124 --> 01:38:26.250]  What type of elite uses depleted uranium in every continent of the planet and uses them in four different wars?
[01:38:29.451 --> 01:38:36.375]  I mean, what type of group does this when it encircles the globe and the atmosphere and we're breathing it?
[01:38:36.375 --> 01:38:41.857]  When they know in their own reports it kills anybody that ingests it.
[01:38:41.857 --> 01:38:46.240]  It may take 10 years to do it, but it's going to kill you.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.641]  These people are psychopaths.
[01:38:49.713 --> 01:38:52.374]  All right, I'm going to shut up and go to your calls.
[01:38:52.374 --> 01:38:58.077]  Oh, the last point was here's We Are Change and I guess Federal Jack, I'm not quite sure who, they just found the clip.
[01:38:58.077 --> 01:39:06.542]  Great folks down in Florida confronting Bush at a public rally and the police throw him out.
[01:39:06.542 --> 01:39:09.003]  And then even after they're leaving, they say, you want to go to jail?
[01:39:09.003 --> 01:39:10.024]  You want to go to jail?
[01:39:10.024 --> 01:39:10.884]  We're not going to play the whole clip.
[01:39:10.884 --> 01:39:12.145]  You can watch it online, but here it is.
[01:39:12.145 --> 01:39:17.928]  September the 11th will come to feel more like Pearl Harbor Day.
[01:39:18.917 --> 01:39:21.182]  An honor date on the calendar.
[01:39:21.182 --> 01:39:23.827]  And an important moment in history.
[01:39:23.827 --> 01:39:25.971]  But not a scar on the heart.
[01:39:25.971 --> 01:39:26.973]  Not a reason to fight on.
[01:39:28.576 --> 01:39:34.320]  9-1-1 was an inside job!
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:34.460]  9-1-1!
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:37.642]  9-1-1 was an inside job!
[01:39:37.642 --> 01:39:40.404]  Talk about that, boys!
[01:39:40.404 --> 01:39:42.065]  You supported torture!
[01:39:42.065 --> 01:39:44.026]  Hey, don't rip on me, sir.
[01:39:44.026 --> 01:39:44.967]  I got you all on camera.
[01:39:44.967 --> 01:39:46.048]  I hope you know that.
[01:39:46.048 --> 01:39:48.269]  You're a criminal!
[01:39:48.269 --> 01:39:50.551]  War criminal!
[01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:51.932]  War criminal!
[01:39:51.932 --> 01:39:53.873]  We know you was going.
[01:39:53.873 --> 01:39:55.234]  Hey, I have the camera on you, sir.
[01:39:56.967 --> 01:39:58.208]  Don't twist my arm, sir.
[01:39:58.208 --> 01:40:00.089]  I'm not resisting you.
[01:40:00.089 --> 01:40:01.430]  How am I resisting you?
[01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:03.591]  I'm just standing here and you're twisting my arm.
[01:40:03.591 --> 01:40:04.491]  Yeah, that's America.
[01:40:04.491 --> 01:40:10.014]  You ask our Lord and Savior, according to some neocons, George W. Bush, a question.
[01:40:10.014 --> 01:40:13.056]  You know, I still roll over at 3 a.m.
[01:40:13.056 --> 01:40:23.562]  and have shooting pain in my right shoulder because for about three or four minutes they twisted my arm up and put my fist way in the middle of my back and tore my rotator cuff.
[01:40:23.562 --> 01:40:26.003]  I've been told I need surgery on it, but I don't like surgery.
[01:40:28.131 --> 01:40:34.834]  Because the one time they did surgery on my leg when I broke it, it took nine times the stuff to keep me under.
[01:40:34.834 --> 01:40:36.375]  I kept waking up during the surgery.
[01:40:36.375 --> 01:40:47.181]  It's probably because they said I have some Native American blood and they have different physiology, but... Point is, I still have an injury from 12 years ago when he was getting ready to run for president.
[01:40:47.181 --> 01:40:50.623]  In fact, YouTube Alex Jones arrested for asking George Bush a question.
[01:40:50.623 --> 01:40:52.564]  Let's show that, an oldie but a goodie.
[01:40:52.564 --> 01:40:53.024]  Same thing.
[01:40:54.141 --> 01:40:56.142]  But he'd been given the same speech over and over again.
[01:40:56.142 --> 01:40:57.663]  He was supposed to have a press conference.
[01:40:57.663 --> 01:40:59.645]  He said, and that's what I want to do for Texas.
[01:40:59.645 --> 01:41:00.845]  I knew he was done.
[01:41:00.845 --> 01:41:03.487]  The press was all there.
[01:41:03.487 --> 01:41:07.029]  They saw I was there, so they didn't go to questions.
[01:41:07.029 --> 01:41:09.291]  And so I said, well, what about the New World Order?
[01:41:09.291 --> 01:41:10.752]  What about the CFR?
[01:41:10.752 --> 01:41:12.473]  Isn't that what's important, Governor?
[01:41:12.473 --> 01:41:18.377]  And they got my arm, twisted it, kidnapped me for an hour, and then threw me out on the side of the highway without charges.
[01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:25.314]  And I've got a tear in my shoulder from that today.
[01:41:25.314 --> 01:41:26.995]  Because I'm not a human.
[01:41:26.995 --> 01:41:28.476]  And the cops doing the same thing here.
[01:41:28.476 --> 01:41:30.378]  Twisting his arm, they're not resisting.
[01:41:30.378 --> 01:41:32.940]  Then they threaten to arrest him, they want to arrest him.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:41.427]  Because how dare an American speak up at a public event?
[01:41:41.427 --> 01:41:44.609]  It's incredible.
[01:41:44.609 --> 01:41:45.911]  People love the tyranny.
[01:41:45.911 --> 01:41:49.854]  Did you find the YouTube of Alex Jones arrested for asking Bush a question?
[01:41:52.785 --> 01:41:53.645]  It's all over the place.
[01:41:53.645 --> 01:41:57.447]  Alex Jones arrested by Bush, it's all over.
[01:41:57.447 --> 01:42:00.749]  While they're finding that, let's go ahead and take another phone call.
[01:42:00.749 --> 01:42:05.011]  Let's go ahead and talk to, by the way, those guys confronting him are heroes.
[01:42:05.011 --> 01:42:08.072]  It's that act of resistance.
[01:42:08.072 --> 01:42:13.114]  And just like a month ago, nobody dislikes the body scanners, nobody dislikes the pat-downs.
[01:42:13.114 --> 01:42:17.756]  A month later, Reuters poll, 96% are against it, won't fly.
[01:42:17.756 --> 01:42:19.337]  You are always angry.
[01:42:19.337 --> 01:42:21.258]  We're not the minority, we're the majority.
[01:42:24.859 --> 01:42:26.119]  Let's talk to Chris in Canada.
[01:42:26.119 --> 01:42:27.780]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:30.741]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[01:42:30.741 --> 01:42:36.683]  I wanted to tell a story about when I lived in South Korea, actually, and it ties into the body scanner thing.
[01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:53.270]  My fiancée at the time, now my wife, we started a blog, and it was called the Anti-NWO Blog in Korean, and we used to take InfoWars stories and translate it to Korean, and other stories, especially related to the body scanners, and translate that into Korean.
[01:42:54.110 --> 01:43:07.557]  So after about two weeks of having our blog up, we got a knock on the door and it was from the Korean police and they were saying that they were going to take my wife basically, or my fiance at the time.
[01:43:07.557 --> 01:43:12.399]  And because they found a post that she made like two years ago about smoking marijuana.
[01:43:14.345 --> 01:43:18.369]  Yeah, South Korea has a lot of its own tyranny as well.
[01:43:18.369 --> 01:43:24.676]  When I said free, I mean free compared to the North, but it's got a lot of oppressive stuff, but good people in Korea.
[01:43:24.676 --> 01:43:31.324]  We have, according to Alexa and other rating systems, we're very, very popular in Korea.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:44.809]  Yeah, and I just really wanted to talk about what's going to come down the pipe, especially if they make us post with our real IDs and stuff like that, and ID numbers or whatever it is, because that's exactly what... Yeah, that's the Microsoft plan.
[01:43:44.809 --> 01:43:49.532]  That's one of the ways they plan on killing the web, is make you do it with IDs.
[01:43:49.532 --> 01:43:51.914]  Then they can ID spoof you and set you up.
[01:43:51.914 --> 01:43:54.236]  That's one of their favorites.
[01:43:54.236 --> 01:43:55.657]  Anyway, the police just wouldn't stop.
[01:43:55.657 --> 01:43:58.139]  They basically harassed us, saying that even if
[01:43:58.769 --> 01:44:01.991]  Her hair test that they're going to make her do comes back not showing anything.
[01:44:01.991 --> 01:44:03.132]  They're going to find something else.
[01:44:03.132 --> 01:44:05.493]  So we ended up just leaving the country.
[01:44:05.493 --> 01:44:06.974]  We're living in Canada now.
[01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:10.015]  So they didn't like you talking bad about Big Brother?
[01:44:10.015 --> 01:44:12.957]  No, especially about the body scanners, which were just put in.
[01:44:12.957 --> 01:44:20.321]  So anyway, we get on the plane, fly back here, and it was just the trip from hell, basically, going through the Vancouver airport.
[01:44:20.321 --> 01:44:21.982]  Like, they searched my dog twice.
[01:44:21.982 --> 01:44:24.504]  I missed a couple of flights because I had to transfer planes.
[01:44:25.441 --> 01:44:31.183]  By the way, the UN and others have said they want to make travel almost impossible and they want to ban non-
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:49.221]  And the kicker of the whole thing was when I got through all the other security, you know, metal detector, I'm fine.
[01:44:49.221 --> 01:44:52.622]  They pulled me aside and said that they're going to body search me this time.
[01:45:11.329 --> 01:45:20.896]  And, uh, they had this big guy, just seemed like a real pervert, using the palms of his hands, going really slow, saying, I'm just going to put my hands on the small of your back now.
[01:45:20.896 --> 01:45:22.297]  And he's like, oh, do you have any pain?
[01:45:22.297 --> 01:45:23.378]  Do you have any pain?
[01:45:23.378 --> 01:45:25.340]  He's like, you're awfully tense.
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:29.623]  So I ended up just, I swore at the guy and said, basically, what the F do you think?
[01:45:29.623 --> 01:45:32.225]  I've been on a plane for, you know, 10 hours.
[01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:35.507]  I haven't, uh, I've missed, you know, three or four planes here.
[01:45:35.507 --> 01:45:40.551]  And, uh, then he tells me I've got to go bend over and he bends me over on the, uh, conveyor belt.
[01:45:41.055 --> 01:45:42.396]  Well, the answer is don't back down.
[01:45:42.396 --> 01:45:44.618]  Fight back ten times more, Chris.
[01:45:44.618 --> 01:45:45.319]  God bless you.
[01:45:45.319 --> 01:45:47.641]  I'm getting a lot of emails, people saying, I'll just move to Canada.
[01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:48.522]  I'll just move to Europe.
[01:45:48.522 --> 01:45:49.763]  Canada is even worse.
[01:45:49.763 --> 01:45:51.365]  Canada is the model of this.
[01:46:05.322 --> 01:46:08.484]  I mean, that's one place I will not go back to.
[01:46:08.484 --> 01:46:17.788]  I mean, they literally kept me for 15 hours, screamed at me, said they were going to put me in prison, felt me up.
[01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:19.109]  But here's the issue.
[01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:23.511]  TSAA now admits they do have men searching women.
[01:46:23.511 --> 01:46:26.293]  They were trying to deny that a week ago on the TSA blog.
[01:46:26.293 --> 01:46:27.453]  We have video of it.
[01:46:27.453 --> 01:46:28.574]  The news has video of it.
[01:46:29.653 --> 01:46:33.294]  They also admit, okay, we are doing more invasive pat-downs now.
[01:46:33.294 --> 01:46:38.875]  They announced more invasive three weeks ago, that they'd already been beta testing, but they're doing it widespread.
[01:46:38.875 --> 01:46:41.096]  Then they said, no, we're not touching genitals.
[01:46:41.096 --> 01:46:46.357]  Now they come out today and say, yeah, we're sticking our hand in your pants.
[01:46:46.357 --> 01:46:49.858]  Now, that's exactly what they do.
[01:46:49.858 --> 01:46:58.180]  And I can't, every time you see a super gorgeous woman in line, because that's who wants to work, there's perverts, they pull her out, and literally,
[01:46:59.187 --> 01:47:00.568]  It's perving.
[01:47:00.568 --> 01:47:04.051]  You watch the men and they go, I'm just gonna touch your hair.
[01:47:04.051 --> 01:47:06.172]  I'm just gonna go through your hair now.
[01:47:06.172 --> 01:47:07.673]  I'm just gonna touch your face now.
[01:47:07.673 --> 01:47:10.416]  I'm just gonna touch the, and they just, oh, I'm gonna touch these now.
[01:47:10.416 --> 01:47:14.078]  Okay, now I'm just gonna, and then they stick their hand in their pants.
[01:47:14.078 --> 01:47:19.522]  They're like, oh, I'm just gonna, and then they, and that's actually in the newspapers today.
[01:47:19.522 --> 01:47:21.024]  Even Mother Jones is reporting on it.
[01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:47.924]  That's what I've got in front of witnesses this young 22 year old you know hot blonde college students in Amarillo and they pulled her blouse down they say on accident with her breast and then all laughed and came up and wanted her number and said oh I'm gonna I'm gonna go back and watch the video of that because she was they can't even control themselves they just think it's normal because they've got the power there's like baby baby and
[01:47:48.772 --> 01:47:52.714]  She started crying, not when they were grabbing her breast or her crotch, when they got in her hair.
[01:47:52.714 --> 01:47:54.854]  They were just like, oh baby, oh.
[01:47:54.854 --> 01:47:58.476]  Let me make sure that, just like you said, oh, is that hurting your back?
[01:47:58.476 --> 01:48:00.336]  Bend over right here.
[01:48:00.336 --> 01:48:02.177]  Oh, let me, oh yeah.
[01:48:02.177 --> 01:48:04.538]  And I mean, these are people that like it.
[01:48:04.538 --> 01:48:07.919]  A normal man wants a woman to be into it.
[01:48:07.919 --> 01:48:10.420]  I mean, if my wife isn't excited, I'm not excited.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:12.681]  But see, I'm normal, I'm a real man.
[01:48:12.681 --> 01:48:14.982]  I don't want to exercise power over weak people.
[01:48:16.764 --> 01:48:21.106]  I want to exercise power over a bully who's stupid enough to swing first.
[01:48:21.106 --> 01:48:26.048]  And just make sure it's on a surveillance camera so I can stomp you royal.
[01:48:26.048 --> 01:48:26.308]  Okay?
[01:48:26.308 --> 01:48:28.949]  I mean, I don't, and I don't even want to fight them until they do that.
[01:48:28.949 --> 01:48:36.453]  The point is, is that somebody who's centered and strong and wholesome wants to fight tyranny, wants to fight bullies.
[01:48:36.453 --> 01:48:39.094]  A real warrior wants to fight other warriors.
[01:48:39.094 --> 01:48:44.116]  A real man or a real woman, they want somebody who's into it.
[01:48:44.116 --> 01:48:46.017]  The greatest pleasure is giving pleasure.
[01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:53.372]  Whether it's cooking a meal for friends or buying buddies a drink, that's the real pleasure in life.
[01:48:53.372 --> 01:48:55.953]  But these people get off on it, and I've watched them.
[01:48:55.953 --> 01:49:01.475]  I was in San Jose three weeks ago, and we went through, and I said, Aaron, wait, let's get coffee right here.
[01:49:01.475 --> 01:49:05.377]  And I told the story, but I'll tell it again, but I'll tell the full story.
[01:49:05.377 --> 01:49:08.278]  I was like, Aaron, there's coffee, let's get some coffee.
[01:49:08.278 --> 01:49:10.700]  Let's sit here, because our plane's not for 45 minutes.
[01:49:12.532 --> 01:49:17.764]  Let's watch because look there's four lines and it's only women and children being sent through the scanners.
[01:49:17.764 --> 01:49:22.275]  And for 20 minutes we sat there drinking coffee and we're like, it was only women and children.
[01:49:24.465 --> 01:49:26.406]  Because they know they'll submit.
[01:49:26.406 --> 01:49:30.489]  And there's the Amarillo Globe News lawsuit airport search incident.
[01:49:30.489 --> 01:49:33.111]  And these women talk about they can't handle it.
[01:49:33.111 --> 01:49:35.773]  Mother Jones has the best article about it.
[01:49:35.773 --> 01:49:37.053]  I forget the headline.
[01:49:37.053 --> 01:49:39.675]  Just type Alex Jones into Google, because I'm in there too.
[01:49:39.675 --> 01:49:40.556]  You'll find it.
[01:49:40.556 --> 01:49:45.119]  It's got the Michelle incident with one of our crew here at the office and her 20-month-old daughter.
[01:49:45.119 --> 01:49:45.659]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:49:45.659 --> 01:49:46.720]  Dues to TSA.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:48.401]  Don't touch that junk.
[01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:53.644]  And Mother Jones does point out something I hadn't remembered, but they spurred my memory on this.
[01:49:54.685 --> 01:50:01.930]  It's been women freaking out about this for six, seven, eight years because it is mainly women that the pervs pull out.
[01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:05.612]  Now they're just trying to do it to basically everybody as they phase it in.
[01:50:05.612 --> 01:50:11.616]  And they go through that now it's men fighting back, but then they mention a bunch of stories of women I didn't know about like this Amarillo one.
[01:50:12.768 --> 01:50:25.443]  And there's another woman in the story of Memory Serves, it's when they get to the hair, they're like, and they report that the men get that quiet sex voice going, like, oh baby, I'm just gonna check this now, I'm just gonna.
[01:50:25.443 --> 01:50:31.430]  The female staffer for Alex Jones' radio show described how she was given the ridiculously thorough pat down by a male screener.
[01:50:32.071 --> 01:50:38.016]  When he moved on to do the same thing to a woman's 20-month-old and 8-year-old daughter, she had to step in.
[01:50:38.016 --> 01:50:43.661]  In Amarillo, a woman sued the TSA after an agent pulled down her blouse, revealing her breast during a pat-down.
[01:50:43.661 --> 01:50:48.325]  The TSA employees laughed and joked about the incident, even after the woman started crying.
[01:50:48.325 --> 01:50:54.390]  A Minnesota woman who's a rape survivor got an enhanced pat-down from a male TSA agent after opting out.
[01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:57.373]  She says she couldn't handle it once he started rubbing through her hair.
[01:50:57.373 --> 01:50:59.515]  He also grabbed the breast and the junk.
[01:51:00.762 --> 01:51:02.082]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.082 --> 01:51:07.664]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.664 --> 01:51:12.686]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.686 --> 01:51:17.708]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.248 --> 01:51:23.470]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:30.594]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.594 --> 01:51:31.714]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.714 --> 01:51:38.057]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:51:45.142 --> 01:51:48.384]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.384 --> 01:51:50.105]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.851 --> 01:52:01.934]  Pure water.
[01:52:01.934 --> 01:52:04.663]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[01:52:04.663 --> 01:52:08.615]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday season than Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:13.910]  We're good to go!
[01:52:42.449 --> 01:52:49.631]  9 years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:53:09.275 --> 01:53:10.576]  My name is Crystal.
[01:53:10.576 --> 01:53:13.519]  I'm a 45 year old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:53:13.519 --> 01:53:17.482]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:53:17.482 --> 01:53:21.625]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:53:21.625 --> 01:53:22.466]  What did Crystal do?
[01:53:22.466 --> 01:53:24.908]  I ordered heart and body extract in August 2006.
[01:53:26.409 --> 01:53:32.811]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.

[01:54:25.962 --> 01:54:32.865]  I'm taking fight, I said I'll never give it up!
[01:54:32.865 --> 01:54:37.007]  And tall, baby!
[01:54:37.007 --> 01:54:39.729]  All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:39.729 --> 01:54:44.011]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:54:44.011 --> 01:54:50.534]  You know, I love it because I know that you're not going to sit around as the world goes by letting these globalists rape you.
[01:54:51.508 --> 01:54:58.393]  You're going to stand up and we're going to take humanity back and point our direction to the stars and the next level in our development.
[01:54:58.393 --> 01:55:01.535]  The New World Order and the globalists are going down.
[01:55:01.535 --> 01:55:01.955]  Look at this.
[01:55:01.955 --> 01:55:05.638]  Senators and TSA defend Love Pats at airports.
[01:55:05.638 --> 01:55:08.180]  Now they're calling it Love Pats.
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:11.822]  That's like Bush calling his plan to drug half of U.S.
[01:55:11.822 --> 01:55:14.704]  schoolchildren the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:55:14.704 --> 01:55:20.949]  Or that's like Bush's people calling the Patriot Act the Patriot Act.
[01:55:22.170 --> 01:55:28.092]  CBS News calls the pats love pats?
[01:55:28.092 --> 01:55:30.893]  I mean, I can't handle it anymore!
[01:55:30.893 --> 01:55:35.875]  Mercury's good for you, torture's good, love pats are good.
[01:55:35.875 --> 01:55:47.880]  Oh yeah, it's real loving with these women, with guys touching their genitals, touching their breasts, inside their pants, and then rubbing through their hair.
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:50.061]  I can't handle it anymore, this is just getting too insane.
[01:55:51.581 --> 01:55:53.483]  They just keep bringing me in crazy articles.
[01:55:53.483 --> 01:55:59.591]  Duncan, blast TSA pat-downs, body scanners, Congressman John J. Duncan.
[01:55:59.591 --> 01:56:03.976]  But see, the globalists will just blow up an airplane and say, see, we told you.
[01:56:03.976 --> 01:56:07.220]  Now we've got to do cavity searches, order with Al Qaeda.
[01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:11.004]  See how when you give in to the fake terror card, the sky's the limit, literally?
[01:56:13.342 --> 01:56:18.386]  All right, here's the George Bush clip that I'm going to Bob, Noah, Adam, Jen, and Gator, and then I've got to get to the news.
[01:56:18.386 --> 01:56:18.967]  I've got to do it.
[01:56:18.967 --> 01:56:21.529]  I'm taking a lot of calls today, though, and it's a lot of fun.
[01:56:21.529 --> 01:56:24.111]  Let's go ahead, and it's fun to fight tyranny.
[01:56:24.111 --> 01:56:30.216]  Let's go ahead and play this clip, though, of where the same thing happened to yours truly, but I even got kidnapped, not arrested.
[01:56:30.216 --> 01:56:38.483]  It was official oppression, and then thrown out on the side of the highway because they knew they had no reason to manhandle me and do this.
[01:56:38.483 --> 01:56:38.964]  Here's the clip.
[01:56:40.694 --> 01:56:46.458]  ...is going to be good for Texas, and that's the most important thing about the campaign.
[01:56:46.458 --> 01:56:49.660]  Sir, shouldn't we abolish the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.701]  That's the real reality that none of you will talk about.
[01:56:51.701 --> 01:56:53.322]  Most of you are members.
[01:56:53.322 --> 01:56:57.185]  That's what's destroying this country, Governor.
[01:56:57.185 --> 01:56:59.246]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[01:56:59.246 --> 01:57:02.548]  What about the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[01:57:02.548 --> 01:57:03.809]  You people are being lied to.
[01:57:03.809 --> 01:57:05.750]  This country's been taken over by Europe.
[01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:06.751]  And I'm being drugged out.
[01:57:06.751 --> 01:57:07.291]  Laugh at it!
[01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:23.253]  Maybe 1% knew about the Federal Reserve 12 years ago when I did that?
[01:57:23.253 --> 01:57:25.374]  Let's trap them up against the wall.
[01:57:25.374 --> 01:57:27.756]  Yeah, don't you love it?
[01:57:27.756 --> 01:57:31.298]  Don't you just love what they're doing and what they're up to?
[01:57:33.462 --> 01:57:34.123]  Look at him, boy.
[01:57:34.123 --> 01:57:36.184]  He's got my fist all the way up the middle of my back.
[01:57:36.184 --> 01:57:37.005]  He's gonna show me.
[01:57:37.005 --> 01:57:38.547]  He's gonna hurt me.
[01:57:38.547 --> 01:57:40.628]  He's gonna hurt me for the rest of my life!
[01:57:40.628 --> 01:57:42.050]  Because I dare have a First Amendment.
[01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:42.590]  Well, don't worry.
[01:57:42.590 --> 01:57:44.672]  The bankers are gonna take your pension fund, buddy.
[01:57:44.672 --> 01:57:48.555]  They're gonna put uranium and fluoride and mercury in your water.
[01:57:48.555 --> 01:57:48.956]  Don't worry.
[01:57:48.956 --> 01:57:52.199]  They're gonna give you GMO and they're gonna murder you.
[01:57:52.199 --> 01:57:55.902]  You know, you're a microcosm of what you do to me.
[01:57:55.902 --> 01:57:59.005]  You think they could give you this unlawful power just to hurt people?
[01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:00.346]  They do it because they're criminal.
[01:58:01.889 --> 01:58:07.818]  And look, you got the Texas Ranger right there, making sure this evil person gets in trouble.
[01:58:07.818 --> 01:58:11.684]  They told me, you're getting charged with this, you're getting charged with that, and I said, good.
[01:58:11.684 --> 01:58:13.687]  I can't wait to sue all of you.
[01:58:13.687 --> 01:58:15.249]  Well, then we'll just kidnap you then.
[01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:20.759]  All right, I'm coming back and going to your phone calls quickly.
[01:58:20.759 --> 01:58:24.040]  I'm going to try to be quick now.
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:24.580]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.601]  Then I'm getting into the news.
[01:58:26.601 --> 01:58:28.041]  Some days I get to it all up front.
[01:58:28.041 --> 01:58:29.262]  Some days I won't get to it all.
[01:58:29.262 --> 01:58:30.942]  Some days I cover nothing but news.
[01:58:30.942 --> 01:58:32.543]  Or some days nothing but guests.
[01:58:32.543 --> 01:58:39.185]  But whatever we do, it's hardcore, it's focused, it's unflinching, and it's all done for the love of liberty.
[01:58:39.185 --> 01:58:45.007]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.718 --> 01:58:50.981]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.981 --> 01:58:54.564]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:58:54.564 --> 01:58:55.685]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:58:55.685 --> 01:59:00.269]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:59:00.269 --> 01:59:06.213]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:59:06.213 --> 01:59:08.355]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:59:08.355 --> 01:59:11.037]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:59:11.377 --> 01:59:17.881]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:59:17.881 --> 01:59:20.082]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:59:20.082 --> 01:59:25.425]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:59:25.425 --> 01:59:30.707]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:59:30.707 --> 01:59:36.090]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:59:36.090 --> 01:59:39.012]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:59:39.252 --> 01:59:42.273]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:59:42.273 --> 01:59:43.273]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:59:43.273 --> 01:59:44.514]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:44.514 --> 01:59:46.335]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:10.284]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.284 --> 02:00:11.864]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.864 --> 02:00:13.405]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.405 --> 02:00:17.607]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.607 --> 02:00:21.670]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.974 --> 02:00:34.575]  We're now into our number three, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:34.575 --> 02:00:40.077]  I'm going to cover the latest TSA legislative and financial news, but I want to continue with your calls.
[02:00:40.077 --> 02:00:42.017]  Love the directions you're taking us in.
[02:00:42.017 --> 02:00:43.778]  Bob in Idaho, you're on the air.
[02:00:43.778 --> 02:00:45.398]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:45.398 --> 02:00:46.619]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:00:46.619 --> 02:00:47.719]  Hey, buddy.
[02:00:47.719 --> 02:00:49.040]  How are you doing today?
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:49.700]  I'm doing wonderful.
[02:00:50.427 --> 02:00:50.827]  Good.
[02:00:50.827 --> 02:00:52.148]  I'm angry.
[02:00:52.148 --> 02:00:55.651]  Um, I have my own TSA horror story from two days ago.
[02:00:55.651 --> 02:00:58.353]  Use your aggressive feelings, boy.
[02:00:58.353 --> 02:00:59.133]  Tell me about it.
[02:00:59.133 --> 02:01:11.322]  Yeah, we, um, we were scheduled to fly out of Spokane, Washington and lo and behold, they had just installed one of those full body scanners on Saturday, which we did not know about.
[02:01:11.322 --> 02:01:13.244]  And, um, when we got to the airport,
[02:01:14.371 --> 02:01:22.838]  Um, you know, take off our shoes and all that other crap and go up and they were running everybody through the full body scanner.
[02:01:22.838 --> 02:01:24.780]  They were not giving them an option.
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:25.501]  Let me stop you.
[02:01:25.501 --> 02:01:27.702]  I want to hear your story, but I want to explain something.
[02:01:27.702 --> 02:01:29.564]  This is all Pavlovian dog training.
[02:01:29.564 --> 02:01:30.064]  They admit it.
[02:01:30.885 --> 02:01:37.012]  First, it's only a few airports to train the cadres of people to learn how folks resist it.
[02:01:37.012 --> 02:01:39.555]  Then it goes into 2030, then 100.
[02:01:39.555 --> 02:01:45.822]  They plan to have these in over 200, all the major airports, then in the shopping malls, then in the schools.
[02:01:45.822 --> 02:01:46.643]  It's all been announced.
[02:01:47.364 --> 02:01:47.704]  That's okay.
[02:01:47.704 --> 02:01:48.165]  In my opinion,
[02:02:12.638 --> 02:02:17.724]  It's the same Nazi dehumanization program that the Nazi used on the Jews.
[02:02:17.724 --> 02:02:19.907]  And they're doing it to us, the general public.
[02:02:19.907 --> 02:02:24.011]  But they were telling everybody to go through the body scanner.
[02:02:24.011 --> 02:02:25.753]  My wife and I opted out.
[02:02:25.753 --> 02:02:30.158]  Actually, when we opted out, there was about 40% of the people that said, no, we won't do it.
[02:02:30.919 --> 02:02:32.539]  They took us over... Ah, that's key!
[02:02:32.539 --> 02:02:37.221]  So you were the first person to trigger, because people were just in that sheep mode.
[02:02:37.221 --> 02:02:42.042]  Imagine if somebody going into the gas chambers all naked, stripped down, would have said no.
[02:02:42.042 --> 02:02:44.582]  Or going into the pits to be shot in the back of the head.
[02:02:44.582 --> 02:02:48.363]  So as soon as you say no, suddenly others find courage.
[02:02:48.363 --> 02:02:48.784]  You bet.
[02:02:48.784 --> 02:02:52.825]  Well, they sent us over to this little gate.
[02:02:52.825 --> 02:02:58.466]  An agent, the TSA, I feel the TSA stands for Too Stupid for Arby's.
[02:02:59.529 --> 02:03:06.956]  Um, the agent was explaining what he was going to do and I asked him, I says, how does it feel to be violating the fourth amendment of the Constitution?
[02:03:06.956 --> 02:03:11.080]  And one of those, one of their clowns was right behind me and he says,
[02:03:11.641 --> 02:03:17.726]  Well, you know, as soon as you walked through that gate and came to our secure area, you lost some of your constitutional rights.
[02:03:17.726 --> 02:03:21.869]  And all I did, I turned around and I said, F you.
[02:03:21.869 --> 02:03:23.410]  You and I don't have a conversation.
[02:03:23.410 --> 02:03:24.971]  Turned my back on him.
[02:03:24.971 --> 02:03:26.692]  Well, let me expand on that.
[02:03:26.692 --> 02:03:31.496]  We actually have the law, and I knew it was civil because I read it years ago.
[02:03:31.496 --> 02:03:36.239]  In 2002, they just seized the airports and the airports agreed to it.
[02:03:36.239 --> 02:03:37.961]  But see, it's quasi-public.
[02:03:38.701 --> 02:03:40.982]  So people call them officers.
[02:03:40.982 --> 02:03:42.643]  They're not sworn officers.
[02:03:42.643 --> 02:03:50.427]  They're hired agents who are creating a precedence for overturning the entire rule of law.
[02:03:50.427 --> 02:03:53.728]  Airports don't even have to have the TSA there.
[02:03:53.728 --> 02:03:55.189]  So it's all made up.
[02:03:55.189 --> 02:04:01.392]  So their argument is you don't have to use this, but the lawsuits need to be launched and no one's done this yet.
[02:04:02.685 --> 02:04:18.550]  In that taxpayer money is used to build those airports, so once taxpayer money is used for a facility, and there's hundreds of federal and state cases on this, they can no longer restrict constitutional rights or free speech on those facilities.
[02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:30.353]  I'm sure you've heard about government buildings or sports stadiums where people get arrested out front handing out political literature or wearing t-shirts, and then they lose the lawsuit because taxpayer funds were used in the building of it.
[02:04:31.113 --> 02:04:33.635]  So, this is all a color of law fraud.
[02:04:33.635 --> 02:04:35.397]  How did this end, Bob?
[02:04:35.397 --> 02:04:39.421]  Well, we went to the enhanced pat-down area.
[02:04:39.421 --> 02:04:40.602]  It's in public.
[02:04:40.602 --> 02:04:47.368]  The guy explained what he was going to do, and I told him, if you do anything that I feel is wrong, I'm stepping back, we're leaving.
[02:04:47.368 --> 02:04:49.329]  He was very careful with me.
[02:04:49.329 --> 02:04:51.592]  The woman was not very careful with my wife.
[02:04:51.592 --> 02:04:52.072]  Stay there!
[02:04:52.072 --> 02:04:52.412]  Stay there!
[02:04:52.412 --> 02:04:56.256]  I want to hear about the rape down on the other side here in Airstrip One.
[02:05:01.124 --> 02:05:07.788]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:07.788 --> 02:05:12.932]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:12.932 --> 02:05:21.658]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:21.658 --> 02:05:25.720]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:27.842]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.134 --> 02:05:34.735]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:05:34.735 --> 02:05:39.796]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[02:05:39.796 --> 02:05:41.937]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:41.937 --> 02:05:43.737]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:43.737 --> 02:05:46.618]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.618 --> 02:05:53.239]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.239 --> 02:05:55.940]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:59.181]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[02:06:00.370 --> 02:06:04.913]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.913 --> 02:06:05.833]  Number 1.
[02:06:05.833 --> 02:06:09.256]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.256 --> 02:06:10.116]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.116 --> 02:06:15.019]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.019 --> 02:06:15.760]  It's true.
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:20.623]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.623 --> 02:06:21.463]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.463 --> 02:06:25.046]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.046 --> 02:06:28.748]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:29.749]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.749 --> 02:06:32.491]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.491 --> 02:06:36.175]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.175 --> 02:06:36.976]  Number 5.
[02:06:36.976 --> 02:06:41.119]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.119 --> 02:06:45.884]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:06.103]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.103 --> 02:08:08.365]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:16.934]  We're already into hour number three, and that's why I don't take a lot of calls, because once I start, I can't stop.
[02:08:16.934 --> 02:08:19.997]  It's like bonbons or potato chips.
[02:08:19.997 --> 02:08:20.958]  I love talking to you.
[02:08:20.958 --> 02:08:21.778]  You're so great.
[02:08:21.778 --> 02:08:23.620]  I don't get into all the info, but it doesn't matter.
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:26.383]  Callers just bring up other info that's just as important.
[02:08:26.383 --> 02:08:27.303]  I got a clip coming up.
[02:08:27.303 --> 02:08:31.927]  Representative John Duncan, former chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee.
[02:08:32.728 --> 02:08:37.572]  He's about to become that again, or maybe even higher level, because the Republicans are coming back in.
[02:08:37.572 --> 02:08:44.278]  He really blasts them and points out, Chertoff, somebody in his own party, has got a sweetheart deal.
[02:08:44.278 --> 02:08:51.263]  This is what I like seeing, people getting out of their partisanship, attacking corruption wherever you see it.
[02:08:51.263 --> 02:08:53.765]  I mean, that's not hard to do.
[02:08:53.765 --> 02:08:57.769]  Just start attacking corruption like Ron Paul does, no matter where you see it.
[02:09:01.616 --> 02:09:12.486]  When you're not lying and when you're just doing what's right, life is a lot easier than having to be a scallywag and having to remember all the different lies and having to keep it all together.
[02:09:12.486 --> 02:09:13.767]  So that's coming up in a minute.
[02:09:13.767 --> 02:09:22.976]  Okay, so Bob in Idaho, you were talking about your wife and you were going through the new body scanner, you refused.
[02:09:24.366 --> 02:09:29.308]  So they gave you the grope down, which they admit is designed to make you do the scanner, the radiation bather.
[02:09:29.308 --> 02:09:30.409]  And they do record your naked body.
[02:09:30.409 --> 02:09:32.349]  They've been caught lying about that.
[02:09:32.349 --> 02:09:34.370]  But you said they were not as careful with your wife.
[02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:35.071]  Tell us about that.
[02:09:35.071 --> 02:09:37.151]  Right.
[02:09:37.151 --> 02:09:44.935]  The woman that was patting her down, I'll say, touched her groin four times.
[02:09:44.935 --> 02:09:46.876]  Not once, not twice, four times.
[02:09:46.876 --> 02:09:48.416]  Why do you think that woman works there?
[02:09:48.416 --> 02:09:49.177]  She likes it.
[02:09:49.177 --> 02:09:50.817]  Oh, I understand.
[02:09:50.817 --> 02:09:52.178]  My wife is a normal
[02:09:52.782 --> 02:10:00.950]  She's normally a quiet woman, but she cussed that woman out more than once.
[02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:07.195]  And it basically traumatized my wife, and she was finally able to settle down today.
[02:10:08.052 --> 02:10:16.239]  Well think how it's traumatizing the TSA, but we know from internal TSA reports that they call them in and they say, do you mind grabbing genitals?
[02:10:16.239 --> 02:10:17.780]  Do you mind sticking your hand in?
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:20.343]  Do you mind putting people through the radiation systems?
[02:10:20.343 --> 02:10:23.585]  And if they have any qualms, they go, thank you, your review is finished.
[02:10:23.585 --> 02:10:27.809]  And then when they get their paycheck a week later, pink slip, you're laid off.
[02:10:27.809 --> 02:10:29.551]  So they're building an army.
[02:10:30.779 --> 02:10:37.163]  That's why the government does these secret bio-tests and chemical tests, killing foster children, troops, and others.
[02:10:37.163 --> 02:10:39.805]  It's not to test the weapons, they know what they do.
[02:10:39.805 --> 02:10:41.927]  It's to create these cadres.
[02:10:41.927 --> 02:10:46.230]  Can you imagine the sizes of these armies of death that they've got?
[02:10:46.230 --> 02:10:49.172]  I mean, these armies of goons at every level?
[02:10:49.172 --> 02:10:51.493]  That's why we're in so much trouble!
[02:10:51.493 --> 02:10:56.317]  And we are, currently we are looking for a class action suit to join.
[02:10:57.775 --> 02:11:03.197]  Well, I think they've kicked off some of those class action suits, and the ACLU's talking about one, so let's do it.
[02:11:03.197 --> 02:11:05.598]  Well, I'm sorry your wife's upset.
[02:11:05.598 --> 02:11:15.521]  Just start fighting the New World Order full-time, and Bob, this is a big wake-up call for everybody, and sometimes you gotta make dictators act like dictators before folks finally wake up.
[02:11:15.521 --> 02:11:16.701]  God bless you.
[02:11:16.701 --> 02:11:20.823]  Let's play this Representative John J. Duncan talking about
[02:11:22.023 --> 02:11:24.724]  He's the former head of the Aviation Subcommittee.
[02:11:24.724 --> 02:11:28.125]  He's about to be the head again now that the Republicans are back in.
[02:11:28.125 --> 02:11:35.867]  Here he is blasting Chertoff, who makes money off the machines that he ordered while he was in power.
[02:11:35.867 --> 02:11:37.828]  Now, if that isn't illegal, I don't know what is.
[02:11:37.828 --> 02:11:40.769]  That's kind of like Henry Paulson getting
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:52.268]  Tens of millions of dollars of bonus money out of Goldman Sachs, which he headed up, but as Treasury Secretary, he gave it to himself.
[02:11:52.268 --> 02:11:55.712]  And they said, Congressman Stern said, where did you get the waiver for that?
[02:11:55.712 --> 02:11:57.974]  And he said, oh, I got it from the Treasury.
[02:11:57.974 --> 02:11:59.355]  And they said, who was the head of the Treasury?
[02:11:59.355 --> 02:11:59.856]  Well, I am.
[02:12:01.135 --> 02:12:06.036]  That'd be like if a bank president said, I gave myself a waiver to have an armed robbery of the bank.
[02:12:06.036 --> 02:12:07.257]  But they just do it.
[02:12:07.257 --> 02:12:10.498]  But this is all starting to come out, the absurdity.
[02:12:10.498 --> 02:12:14.099]  And they do it all with the name of authority and, well, we're the bosses.
[02:12:14.099 --> 02:12:15.539]  No, you're not the bosses.
[02:12:15.539 --> 02:12:17.100]  You're a bunch of slimy scum.
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:19.120]  It's over.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:20.381]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[02:12:20.381 --> 02:12:20.721]  Here it is.
[02:12:21.516 --> 02:12:26.898]  Mr. Speaker, a nationwide revolt is developing over the body scanners at the airports and it should.
[02:12:26.898 --> 02:12:33.300]  Hundreds of thousands of frequent flyers who fly each week are upset about getting these frequent doses of radiation.
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:39.462]  Parents are upset about being forced to have their children radiated or being touched inappropriately by an unrelated adult.
[02:12:40.562 --> 02:12:48.468]  There's already plenty of security at the airport, but now we are going to spend up to $300 million to install 1,000 scanners.
[02:12:48.468 --> 02:12:52.011]  This is much more about money than it is about security.
[02:12:52.011 --> 02:12:59.517]  The former Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, represents RapaScan, the company which is selling these scanners to his former department.
[02:13:00.057 --> 02:13:04.481]  Far too many federal contracts are sweetheart insider deals.
[02:13:04.481 --> 02:13:12.408]  Companies hire former high-ranking federal officials and then, magically, those companies get hugely profitable federal contracts.
[02:13:12.408 --> 02:13:22.057]  The American people should not have to choose between having full-body radiation or a very embarrassing intrusive pat-down every time they fly as if they were criminals.
[02:13:22.057 --> 02:13:24.620]  We need a little more balance and common sense on this.
[02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:27.318]  But I thought we liked a police state.
[02:13:27.318 --> 02:13:29.938]  We liked this fetish of being scared of the Muslims.
[02:13:29.938 --> 02:13:33.580]  I mean, let's say 9-11 was really a Muslim job.
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:38.061]  15 of the 19 come from Saudi Arabia.
[02:13:38.061 --> 02:13:41.942]  We invade Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:13:41.942 --> 02:13:43.003]  There's no WMDs.
[02:13:43.003 --> 02:13:44.143]  They lied about that.
[02:13:44.143 --> 02:13:50.425]  Came out in the White House memos that Bush wanted to shoot down a US airplane or have it shot down to blame it on Saddam.
[02:13:53.752 --> 02:14:07.064]  We know they staged these events, but even if it was real terror, you got a better chance of being struck by lightning, a better chance of drowning, a better chance of dying in a car wreck, a better chance of getting rare cancer.
[02:14:07.064 --> 02:14:10.427]  But it's so scary and the media hypes it!
[02:14:10.427 --> 02:14:13.090]  It's this perception!
[02:14:13.090 --> 02:14:15.872]  And we're sacrificing all of our liberties on the altar of it.
[02:14:15.872 --> 02:14:17.294]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:14:19.172 --> 02:14:24.193]  And there's more than one way to skin a Nazi-like thug.
[02:14:24.193 --> 02:14:34.015]  And the way to go after Chertoff, Herr Chertoff, is to point out that, A, he's a dual citizen of Israel.
[02:14:34.015 --> 02:14:37.296]  His parents were Mossad spies.
[02:14:37.296 --> 02:14:38.056]  That's a big issue.
[02:14:38.056 --> 02:14:41.517]  You shouldn't have somebody head of Homeland Security that's a known spy.
[02:14:41.517 --> 02:14:45.578]  Kind of like, oh, what's his name, now running for mayor.
[02:14:47.142 --> 02:14:48.863]  Up in Chicago.
[02:14:48.863 --> 02:14:49.663]  Yeah, Rahm Emanuel.
[02:14:49.663 --> 02:14:54.466]  I mean, his mommy and daddy were eargun commanders staging terror attacks.
[02:14:54.466 --> 02:15:00.389]  I mean, the point is, that's one way to go after these guys, because it's wrong what they've done.
[02:15:00.389 --> 02:15:05.491]  But, I mean, we shouldn't have former KGB bosses running our country, or Chinese spies running it.
[02:15:05.491 --> 02:15:07.292]  I mean, I'm into sovereignty.
[02:15:07.292 --> 02:15:12.815]  But the bigger issue is you go after them for these sweetheart deal insider contracts.
[02:15:12.815 --> 02:15:16.597]  You know, they're sending Rangel up the river for pretty petty stuff like
[02:15:17.964 --> 02:15:19.985]  Trying to avoid some taxes.
[02:15:19.985 --> 02:15:23.406]  And I'm not saying that's good, because he's a big tax expender.
[02:15:23.406 --> 02:15:28.209]  Or, you know, using funds out of an account to pay for lawyers.
[02:15:28.209 --> 02:15:29.749]  I mean, big deal.
[02:15:29.749 --> 02:15:30.830]  I'm not saying Rangel's good.
[02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:33.791]  The point is, why don't we go after Chertoff?
[02:15:33.791 --> 02:15:35.712]  Why don't we go after Halliburton and all its corruption?
[02:15:35.712 --> 02:15:37.153]  Why don't we go after Dyncor?
[02:15:37.153 --> 02:15:38.673]  Why don't we go after the Federal Reserve?
[02:15:38.673 --> 02:15:40.254]  Why don't we go after the real crooks?
[02:15:40.254 --> 02:15:40.934]  Why, for 11 years,
[02:15:42.489 --> 02:15:47.192]  Did the Securities and Exchange Commission know exactly what Bernie Madoff was doing and protecting?
[02:15:47.192 --> 02:15:51.334]  Because the big crooks are protected.
[02:15:51.334 --> 02:15:53.676]  And I'll say it, Chertoff is a crook.
[02:15:55.436 --> 02:15:58.218]  He's violating our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:15:58.218 --> 02:16:00.079]  He went along with tyranny.
[02:16:00.079 --> 02:16:01.420]  He went along with corruption.
[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:04.962]  He covered up the truth about 9-11 as Homeland Security head.
[02:16:04.962 --> 02:16:09.105]  Ridge admitted that their agency routinely issued fake terror alerts.
[02:16:09.105 --> 02:16:10.566]  We know that continued under Chertoff.
[02:16:10.566 --> 02:16:13.628]  That's a violation of the Patriot Act, issuing fake terror alerts.
[02:16:13.628 --> 02:16:22.314]  And he began the lobbying and the orders for the first naked scanners that went in before he even left office, and now he heads the company up.
[02:16:25.359 --> 02:16:26.500]  So let's go after him.
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:29.242]  Let's start talking about Herr Chertoff.
[02:16:29.242 --> 02:16:30.964]  We've been talking about this for years.
[02:16:30.964 --> 02:16:32.685]  Now it's all over the news.
[02:16:32.685 --> 02:16:36.588]  Now it's the top link on the Drudge Report.
[02:16:36.588 --> 02:16:37.509]  This is more like it.
[02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:39.611]  The Drudge Report going after Chertoff.
[02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:41.152]  That's what I like!
[02:16:41.152 --> 02:16:45.435]  I like seeing Matt Drudge not be just a Republican and be a real populist.
[02:16:45.435 --> 02:16:46.996]  Let's go after all of them together!
[02:16:47.793 --> 02:16:48.994]  Let's go after Hillary!
[02:16:48.994 --> 02:16:50.234]  Let's go after Obama!
[02:16:50.234 --> 02:16:51.355]  Let's go after Bush!
[02:16:51.355 --> 02:16:52.516]  Let's go after Cheney!
[02:16:52.516 --> 02:16:53.736]  Let's go after Chertoff!
[02:16:53.736 --> 02:16:55.497]  Let's go after Bloomberg!
[02:16:55.497 --> 02:16:59.379]  Bloomberg, give me a break with all his offshore corporations and the rest of it.
[02:16:59.379 --> 02:17:00.940]  Let's go after all of them.
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:03.922]  Let's go after all the hypocrites.
[02:17:03.922 --> 02:17:08.324]  Bloomberg hadn't found a tax he didn't love, meanwhile he's got most of his money offshore.
[02:17:08.324 --> 02:17:12.266]  Google pays 2.4% tax.
[02:17:12.266 --> 02:17:13.467]  Middle class companies pay 40%.
[02:17:13.467 --> 02:17:15.308]  I pay 40% corporate tax.
[02:17:18.584 --> 02:17:21.005]  I pay supposedly 35% personal.
[02:17:21.005 --> 02:17:23.867]  It's more like 45.
[02:17:23.867 --> 02:17:25.588]  There's nothing enough for these people.
[02:17:25.588 --> 02:17:28.250]  If I made more money, it'd go to these employees.
[02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:30.411]  It'd go to hiring more people.
[02:17:30.411 --> 02:17:34.454]  I don't get 111 waivers like Jack in the Box at McDonald's.
[02:17:34.454 --> 02:17:38.016]  If I want to start a hamburger place, I'm not going to get the waivers on insurance.
[02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:43.267]  So I'm not going to be able to pay the people a good wage and get them insurance.
[02:17:43.267 --> 02:17:44.589]  I'm going to go out of business.
[02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:49.199]  But McDonald's and Walmart, they're going to be able to lower prices and put me out of business!
[02:17:49.199 --> 02:17:50.501]  That's how this tyranny works!
[02:17:53.029 --> 02:17:56.532]  It's all about the big megacorporations being above the law.
[02:17:56.532 --> 02:17:58.894]  And Google being government run.
[02:17:58.894 --> 02:18:00.596]  Google's a criminal organization.
[02:18:00.596 --> 02:18:02.418]  Indict them for all their admitted crimes.
[02:18:02.418 --> 02:18:03.919]  Illegal spying.
[02:18:03.919 --> 02:18:06.361]  Bloomberg's got illegal offshore corporations.
[02:18:06.361 --> 02:18:07.242]  Indict him!
[02:18:07.242 --> 02:18:08.283]  Chertoff's illegal.
[02:18:08.283 --> 02:18:09.144]  Indict him!
[02:18:09.144 --> 02:18:09.704]  Indict!
[02:18:09.704 --> 02:18:10.225]  Indict!
[02:18:10.225 --> 02:18:10.725]  Indict!
[02:18:10.725 --> 02:18:11.145]  Indict!
[02:18:12.170 --> 02:18:13.811]  I don't want a lawless revolution.
[02:18:13.811 --> 02:18:17.174]  I want to take our governments back, our state legislatures back.
[02:18:17.174 --> 02:18:28.243]  I want to indict all these people and let a jury see the evidence and then we'll take all the marijuana smokers out of the prisons who've done nothing wrong but are good at making license plates and furniture and driving down wages.
[02:18:28.243 --> 02:18:29.964]  They work for average 25 cents an hour.
[02:18:29.964 --> 02:18:32.466]  All you idiots that say make prisoners work.
[02:18:32.466 --> 02:18:33.147]  Fools.
[02:18:33.147 --> 02:18:34.508]  You watch Shawshank Redemption.
[02:18:34.508 --> 02:18:36.570]  That's how the real world works even though it's fiction.
[02:18:36.570 --> 02:18:38.051]  That's the truth hiding in fiction.
[02:18:40.885 --> 02:18:43.126]  And let's stick all these people in the prisons.
[02:18:43.126 --> 02:18:46.147]  Let's give them trials, juries, everything.
[02:18:46.147 --> 02:18:47.908]  We got plenty of room for them.
[02:18:47.908 --> 02:18:49.468]  You want a nice prison?
[02:18:49.468 --> 02:18:50.148]  Here it is!
[02:18:50.148 --> 02:19:00.112]  Let me tell you, you start busting 10, 15, 20, they're gonna start rolling over on each other, and you'll see a huge rout.
[02:19:00.112 --> 02:19:01.833]  The whole house of cards will just fall down.
[02:19:03.288 --> 02:19:05.048]  Does that mean we'll be in Valhalla?
[02:19:05.048 --> 02:19:06.649]  Some type of heavenly utopia?
[02:19:06.649 --> 02:19:07.369]  No!
[02:19:07.369 --> 02:19:09.669]  The corruption will start right back over.
[02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:11.830]  And we've all got an appetite for corruption.
[02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:14.730]  And there's a lot of people in the system that make money out of the corruption.
[02:19:14.730 --> 02:19:15.530]  You've got to decide.
[02:19:15.530 --> 02:19:18.151]  Do you want total tyranny?
[02:19:18.151 --> 02:19:19.351]  Or do you want to have liberty?
[02:19:19.351 --> 02:19:25.392]  And you've got to decide what type of country and world you want to live in.
[02:19:25.392 --> 02:19:28.253]  These people are committing crimes right out in the open.
[02:19:31.286 --> 02:19:41.493]  If you try to set up an offshore corporation and pay 2.4% corporate tax, you're going to prison.
[02:19:41.493 --> 02:19:42.894]  Let's say you're making a million dollars a year.
[02:19:42.894 --> 02:19:44.174]  That's mainly who they bust.
[02:19:44.174 --> 02:19:48.097]  Those thousands of Swiss bank accounts they grabbed, on average they were a little over a million.
[02:19:48.097 --> 02:19:50.118]  They're not grabbing the billions.
[02:19:50.118 --> 02:19:51.479]  They're not grabbing the U.S.
[02:19:51.479 --> 02:19:53.540]  generals with all their accounts.
[02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:54.921]  No.
[02:19:54.921 --> 02:19:59.024]  They're not investigating the 4 trillion now missing from the Pentagon in the last 10 years.
[02:19:59.024 --> 02:20:00.405]  They're investigating little guys.
[02:20:00.805 --> 02:20:05.366]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.366 --> 02:20:06.266]  Number 1.
[02:20:06.266 --> 02:20:09.687]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:09.687 --> 02:20:10.567]  Number 2.
[02:20:10.567 --> 02:20:15.449]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.449 --> 02:20:16.189]  It's true.
[02:20:16.189 --> 02:20:21.070]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.070 --> 02:20:21.890]  Number 3.
[02:20:21.890 --> 02:20:25.471]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.471 --> 02:20:29.172]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.372 --> 02:20:30.173]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.173 --> 02:20:32.936]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:32.936 --> 02:20:36.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:37.400]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:41.565]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.565 --> 02:20:46.330]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.610 --> 02:20:50.773]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:50.773 --> 02:20:52.554]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.554 --> 02:20:54.816]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:20:54.816 --> 02:20:57.158]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.047 --> 02:21:05.251]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:21:05.251 --> 02:21:06.672]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:21:06.672 --> 02:21:10.676]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:21:10.676 --> 02:21:13.418]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[02:21:13.418 --> 02:21:15.400]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:17.702]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:21:18.723 --> 02:21:27.495]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:21:27.495 --> 02:21:31.000]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.104]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:21:34.304 --> 02:21:36.225]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[02:21:40.086 --> 02:21:40.866]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:21:40.866 --> 02:21:43.887]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:21:43.887 --> 02:21:44.347]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:22:00.492 --> 02:22:05.456]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:05.456 --> 02:22:06.437]  What have we got?
[02:22:06.437 --> 02:22:08.899]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:08.899 --> 02:22:09.900]  A republic.
[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:12.542]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:12.542 --> 02:22:14.804]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:14.804 --> 02:22:16.846]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:16.846 --> 02:22:18.527]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:18.527 --> 02:22:19.849]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:19.849 --> 02:22:20.449]  Children?
[02:22:20.449 --> 02:22:21.570]  Our education?
[02:22:21.570 --> 02:22:22.391]  Our money?
[02:22:22.391 --> 02:22:26.054]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:26.414 --> 02:22:30.098]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:30.098 --> 02:22:31.380]  You are being warned.
[02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:32.401]  We have the facts.
[02:22:32.401 --> 02:22:33.562]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:33.562 --> 02:22:34.484]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:34.484 --> 02:22:35.365]  We have common law.
[02:22:35.365 --> 02:22:37.888]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:37.888 --> 02:22:40.831]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:22:40.831 --> 02:22:41.672]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:41.772 --> 02:22:46.718]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:46.718 --> 02:22:48.220]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:48.220 --> 02:22:49.301]  Don't tread on me.
[02:22:49.301 --> 02:22:55.749]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:23:00.555 --> 02:23:05.382]  Hurricanes, ice storms, blackouts, and the prospect of civil unrest.
[02:23:05.382 --> 02:23:08.446]  When the unexpected happens, will you be ready?
[02:23:08.446 --> 02:23:15.516]  Hundreds of concerned citizens across America have already installed wind generators to help protect their families in the event of a disaster.

[02:23:43.844 --> 02:23:44.184]  We're good.
[02:24:23.789 --> 02:24:27.532]  Alright, I better get moving or I'll never get to this news, and it's all off the charts.
[02:24:27.532 --> 02:24:32.797]  Paul Watson's got a new article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:36.281]  Who knows if it's destined to the Drudge Report?
[02:24:36.281 --> 02:24:37.261]  I think it's important.
[02:24:37.261 --> 02:24:43.727]  DHS source, TSA infuriated with coverage of national backlash.
[02:24:44.693 --> 02:24:51.415]  Because if they fail here, their federal goon takeover beachhead, they will fail on every front.
[02:24:51.415 --> 02:24:55.857]  This is like Hitler in Leningrad.
[02:24:55.857 --> 02:24:58.258]  That year and a half battle.
[02:24:58.258 --> 02:25:03.019]  And the Russians knew, and the Nazis knew, whoever won that battle would win the war.
[02:25:03.019 --> 02:25:07.481]  And the tide is turning at Leningrad against the Nazis.
[02:25:07.481 --> 02:25:09.962]  And I'm not in this analogy saying the Soviets were good, but
[02:25:11.391 --> 02:25:14.974]  The point is, you get what I'm saying.
[02:25:14.974 --> 02:25:22.441]  Let's go ahead and, it was two evil groups fighting each other, but I do use the analogy of Hitler's Barbara Rosa.
[02:25:22.441 --> 02:25:27.965]  You know, the TSA is Hitler, and if they win here, it's gonna be a harder fight.
[02:25:27.965 --> 02:25:34.991]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[02:25:34.991 --> 02:25:36.753]  Let's talk to Noah in Oklahoma.
[02:25:36.753 --> 02:25:37.774]  You're on the air, welcome.
[02:25:38.612 --> 02:25:52.067]  Hi Alex, I've got a friend here in Oklahoma, he's an Oklahoma Highway Patrolman and he kind of keeps me informed of what's going on and he lets me have his old editions of a magazine called Law Officer.
[02:25:53.058 --> 02:25:56.122]  And he said, you know, just read some of these articles in here and you'll see.
[02:25:56.122 --> 02:25:58.204]  And he actually is the one that turned me on to you.
[02:25:58.204 --> 02:26:00.847]  And so I said, man, at least I got one Patriot out here.
[02:26:00.847 --> 02:26:08.576]  But he gave me the November issue with the, let's see here, volume six of Law Officer.
[02:26:08.576 --> 02:26:09.657]  And I think it's Law Officer.
[02:26:11.113 --> 02:26:19.515]  And it's all about how in Pennsylvania, FEMA has just trained a big group of law enforcement agents.
[02:26:19.515 --> 02:26:24.336]  I don't have time to go through the whole article, but that's just for your information.
[02:26:24.336 --> 02:26:28.797]  And then I wanted to tell you about something else that he's kind of turned me on to.
[02:26:28.797 --> 02:26:35.139]  Well, it came out in Pennsylvania they were using an Israeli company illegally to even spy on the legislature.
[02:26:35.982 --> 02:26:45.332]  So, I mean, it's just off-the-chart secret spy grids with these fusion centers who aren't even federal-run, they're foreign government-run.
[02:26:45.332 --> 02:26:54.082]  But no, I mean, get into this law enforcement publication, because I remember right before 9-11 reading the law enforcement publications off the shelf.
[02:26:55.896 --> 02:26:59.578]  Well, basically, he gave it to me and I haven't had time to read the entire thing.
[02:26:59.578 --> 02:27:00.458]  I'm still at work right now.
[02:27:00.458 --> 02:27:02.219]  The name of it is... and I have one more thing to tell you.
[02:27:26.042 --> 02:27:30.825]  It's on page 10, and it's called Getting Ready.
[02:27:30.825 --> 02:27:39.109]  And what I just kind of skimmed through it, kind of sped through it, but what I got out of it was they're getting ready not for men in turbans, but they're getting ready
[02:27:39.700 --> 02:27:43.162]  Oh, political get-togethers and the right to assemble.
[02:27:43.162 --> 02:27:44.263]  It's all about... No, no, no!
[02:27:44.263 --> 02:27:47.025]  That's the... Of course, that's the bait-and-switch.
[02:27:47.025 --> 02:27:49.406]  They tell you it's for turban men.
[02:27:49.406 --> 02:27:57.451]  The whole time, even back under Bush, it's all about gun owners, conservatives, land rights people, because they got rid of Glass-Steagall, the Republicans and Democrats together.
[02:27:57.451 --> 02:28:00.133]  They know they're getting ready to get rid of Social Security.
[02:28:00.133 --> 02:28:02.234]  They know they're getting ready to take your pension funds.
[02:28:02.234 --> 02:28:04.556]  They know they're getting ready to devalue your money.
[02:28:04.556 --> 02:28:06.457]  They're bringing us into economic slavery.
[02:28:06.957 --> 02:28:11.139]  And so they're getting you ready for the cops to mow you down on the streets.
[02:28:11.139 --> 02:28:13.440]  And so of course they're training the cops.
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:16.021]  Look, you have this hatred of the Muslim.
[02:28:16.021 --> 02:28:16.901]  They're going to get you.
[02:28:16.901 --> 02:28:21.403]  And they go, now you've been trained as an attack dog to attack the Muslim dummy.
[02:28:21.403 --> 02:28:25.345]  Now we're going to take the turban off and put a John Deere cap on the dummy.
[02:28:25.345 --> 02:28:28.186]  Well, the dog is still going to attack the guy with the John Deere hat.
[02:28:28.999 --> 02:28:29.902]  Okay?
[02:28:29.902 --> 02:28:31.165]  And so that's it, period.
[02:28:31.165 --> 02:28:36.800]  The police are now being turned into literal NKVD ringwraiths of hell.
[02:28:38.257 --> 02:28:41.640]  And then I have one more thing for you.
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:47.084]  This guy that I'm talking about, he told me that he actually had a home birth.
[02:28:47.084 --> 02:28:49.806]  His wife has had their child at home.
[02:28:49.806 --> 02:29:03.576]  And he said that to avoid all this blood taking and everything, find you a trusted midwife who you just absolutely trust and you can have your baby at home if you're physically fit and you got the financial means.
[02:29:03.576 --> 02:29:04.637]  But that is a way
[02:29:05.077 --> 02:29:07.097]  Absolutely, and stop giving your money to the Fortune 100.
[02:29:07.097 --> 02:29:08.198]  Great points, appreciate that call.
[02:29:08.198 --> 02:29:08.998]  That guy was very evil.
[02:29:08.998 --> 02:29:12.559]  Did you hear him talking about freedom and he's got a law enforcement publication?
[02:29:12.559 --> 02:29:13.579]  It's called Getting Ready?
[02:29:13.579 --> 02:29:14.099]  Is he still there?
[02:29:14.099 --> 02:29:15.619]  What was the name of the publication?
[02:29:34.206 --> 02:29:35.067]  Did he ever give us the name?
[02:29:35.067 --> 02:29:37.108]  I think he did briefly at the start.
[02:29:37.108 --> 02:29:38.829]  It doesn't matter, I read it everywhere.
[02:29:38.829 --> 02:29:40.770]  Yeah, no, no, this whole thing's for us.
[02:29:40.770 --> 02:29:42.291]  As you notice at the airport.
[02:29:42.291 --> 02:29:45.873]  And they're now saying the Muslims will be exempt, of course, from all the searches.
[02:29:45.873 --> 02:29:46.493]  Of course!
[02:29:46.493 --> 02:29:51.076]  I mean, come on!
[02:29:51.076 --> 02:29:52.477]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.477 --> 02:29:54.998]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.998 --> 02:29:57.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.020 --> 02:30:06.044]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.044 --> 02:30:09.288]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.288 --> 02:30:14.073]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.073 --> 02:30:20.480]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:22.723]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.243 --> 02:30:23.543]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.543 --> 02:30:23.823]  Bernanke?
[02:30:23.823 --> 02:30:24.423]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.423 --> 02:30:25.184]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:25.184 --> 02:30:26.864]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:49.440]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:58.551]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:31:00.894 --> 02:31:04.477]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:04.477 --> 02:31:05.778]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:05.778 --> 02:31:10.182]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:10.182 --> 02:31:16.128]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:16.128 --> 02:31:18.269]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:20.952]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.

[02:32:04.392 --> 02:32:05.653]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.653 --> 02:32:09.236]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.236 --> 02:32:11.819]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:11.819 --> 02:32:17.684]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:17.684 --> 02:32:23.950]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.350 --> 02:32:30.294]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.294 --> 02:32:34.516]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.516 --> 02:32:38.799]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:38.799 --> 02:32:44.742]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.742 --> 02:32:48.304]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.304 --> 02:32:50.265]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.265 --> 02:32:50.706]  It's here.

[02:33:08.618 --> 02:33:14.963]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.359 --> 02:33:25.603]  Hey, I've got some really good news for everybody.
[02:33:25.603 --> 02:33:31.127]  I've heard the state police in Texas criticizing the naked body scanners because they don't like their genitals being grabbed.
[02:33:31.127 --> 02:33:34.029]  Well, here's one out of ABC News.
[02:33:34.029 --> 02:33:37.551]  DA promises to prosecute overly touchy pat-downs.
[02:33:37.551 --> 02:33:38.772]  Yeah.
[02:33:38.772 --> 02:33:44.216]  You got a bunch of federal security guards now saying they're going to stick your hands in the pants.
[02:33:44.216 --> 02:33:46.678]  See, that way, oh, you don't like us patting on the outside?
[02:33:46.678 --> 02:33:48.119]  We're going inside your pants.
[02:33:49.284 --> 02:33:51.225]  See how this works?
[02:33:51.225 --> 02:33:52.606]  See how it's always more, more, more?
[02:33:52.606 --> 02:33:57.169]  That way, okay, we won't go in your pants, just the outside.
[02:33:57.169 --> 02:33:59.110]  And then it's, we're gonna do a proctology exam.
[02:33:59.110 --> 02:34:03.293]  Okay, we won't do that.
[02:34:03.293 --> 02:34:07.796]  We're just gonna do the pat inside the pants.
[02:34:07.796 --> 02:34:13.980]  The San Mato District Attorney's Office has a warning to all TSA personnel.
[02:34:15.865 --> 02:34:24.231]  That the SFO, anyone inappropriately touching a passenger during a security pat-down will be prosecuted.
[02:34:24.231 --> 02:34:37.141]  That's the incoming DA, Steve Wagstaff, says any complaints of inappropriate touching during an airport screening pat-down will land on his desk.
[02:34:37.141 --> 02:34:39.302]  And they go on to say they will prosecute.
[02:34:39.302 --> 02:34:43.566]  See, just because the feds hire a bunch of minimum wage 7-11 clerks and
[02:34:45.990 --> 02:34:50.313]  Tell them that they're allowed to grab our junk doesn't mean they just get to do it.
[02:34:50.313 --> 02:34:52.755]  And I don't care if you claim there might be a crime.
[02:34:52.755 --> 02:34:58.639]  There are muggings and murders almost every day in the town I live in of a million people.
[02:34:58.639 --> 02:35:01.161]  Do we have checkpoints at every corner to stop it?
[02:35:01.161 --> 02:35:02.181]  No!
[02:35:02.181 --> 02:35:02.942]  Life is dangerous.
[02:35:03.462 --> 02:35:06.746]  I've seen the statistics that more people die every year in the U.S.
[02:35:06.746 --> 02:35:10.049]  from honeybee stings than they do from terrorism.
[02:35:10.049 --> 02:35:14.794]  Do we have checkpoints at every field and little body scanners for the bees to fly through?
[02:35:14.794 --> 02:35:24.285]  And FBI most wanted with honeybees photos and everyone's scared and, oh my gosh, we've got to federalize everything or the honeybees will get us?
[02:35:26.437 --> 02:35:34.623]  It's a psychological fetish or mental illness to just obsess on the Arabs and how they're gonna get us.
[02:35:34.623 --> 02:35:37.665]  Arm the pilots!
[02:35:37.665 --> 02:35:39.526]  We can't do that, they might shoot somebody.
[02:35:39.526 --> 02:35:42.188]  Oh, they can fly the big plane?
[02:35:42.188 --> 02:35:43.829]  That they could crash?
[02:35:43.829 --> 02:35:46.711]  But what if a pilot goes crazy?
[02:35:46.711 --> 02:35:48.092]  That's life!
[02:35:48.092 --> 02:35:51.615]  Maybe we should put a brain chip in the pilot to make sure he can't do that.
[02:35:51.615 --> 02:35:53.156]  I mean, where does this end?
[02:35:56.974 --> 02:35:59.255]  Where does this level of oppression end?
[02:36:03.137 --> 02:36:10.000]  So our big story up on Drudge today, DrudgeReport.com, TSA hit with lawsuits as revolt explodes, goes over all that.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.702]  TSA chief defends new pat-down procedure.
[02:36:13.702 --> 02:36:18.744]  They go on and admit that yes, it is more invasive.
[02:36:18.744 --> 02:36:22.626]  Here's Associated Press, TSA boss, new pat-downs are more invasive.
[02:36:22.626 --> 02:36:24.747]  She just said Monday that they weren't.
[02:36:24.747 --> 02:36:27.308]  She said, we've always been doing these.
[02:36:27.308 --> 02:36:28.289]  George Soros,
[02:36:29.574 --> 02:36:33.496]  Is profiting off the new controversial TSA scanners owns a big part of the company.
[02:36:33.496 --> 02:36:35.497]  Of course he does.
[02:36:35.497 --> 02:36:41.860]  It's all part of the inside fun.
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:45.662]  So we've got all of those key reports.
[02:36:45.662 --> 02:36:50.084]  They also admit now they want to save the TSA scans to use them for biometrics.
[02:36:50.084 --> 02:36:51.865]  We told you that a long time ago.
[02:36:51.865 --> 02:36:52.726]  I mean the pushback
[02:36:55.011 --> 02:37:01.654]  Penn Jillette is talking about them trying to put their hands in his pants, and the cop at the airport wanted to arrest them.
[02:37:01.654 --> 02:37:03.755]  So see, this is all about common law.
[02:37:03.755 --> 02:37:11.598]  They're just trying to, with precedent, normalize all of these activities.
[02:37:11.598 --> 02:37:16.460]  Okay, continuing here, the German Interior Minister,
[02:37:19.096 --> 02:37:28.300]  Thomas de Mesurier on Wednesday warned that government had indications Islamists were planning terror attacks in Germany later this month.
[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:35.224]  Germany's being asked to give tens of billions more to the private banks in the name of bailing out Greece and Portugal, which always just makes it worse.
[02:37:35.224 --> 02:37:38.505]  It's mathematically impossible to pay back through fractional reserve banking.
[02:37:38.505 --> 02:37:39.966]  It's made up money.
[02:37:39.966 --> 02:37:43.988]  It's meant to leave the banks, the private super banks owning everything.
[02:37:43.988 --> 02:37:46.469]  And so, oh my gosh, they need to pass this bailout.
[02:37:47.109 --> 02:37:49.352]  And, uh, oh, Al-Qaeda!
[02:37:49.352 --> 02:37:50.494]  Al-Qaeda's gonna hit!
[02:37:50.494 --> 02:38:01.587]  It's always when the naked body scanners are going in, or right when the head of British Airways says, remove them, that the toner cartridges get mailed by Anwar al-Awlaki, the admitted guy hanging out at the Pentagon.
[02:38:03.015 --> 02:38:07.779]  We've got all these former Clinton people saying, Obama needs a terror attack so he can act strong.
[02:38:07.779 --> 02:38:10.681]  I mean, they're just out in the open, like we're stupid.
[02:38:30.677 --> 02:38:41.526]  There is information from our foreign partners that planned attacks are allegedly to be carried out at the end of November, he said in Berlin, describing a new situation.
[02:38:41.526 --> 02:38:43.288]  They have burned our rice dog!
[02:38:43.288 --> 02:38:44.929]  We must take your rights now!
[02:38:44.929 --> 02:38:49.193]  They have burned the... Oh, excuse me, that was an 80-year-old script.
[02:38:49.906 --> 02:38:52.408]  77-year-old script.
[02:38:52.408 --> 02:38:53.529]  Let me go back.
[02:38:53.529 --> 02:39:07.999]  There is information from our foreign partners that blind attacks are allegedly to be carried out at the end of November, he said in Berlin, describing a new situation regarding the Islamists' threat towards the nation.
[02:39:09.468 --> 02:39:12.891]  There is reason to be worried, but no reason to panic.
[02:39:12.891 --> 02:39:14.573]  Don't worry, we are in control.
[02:39:14.573 --> 02:39:19.157]  He said, mentioning concrete leads being followed by the authorities.
[02:39:19.157 --> 02:39:28.425]  Is that like the London Guardian and Der Spiegel have reported that every white supremacist group that has carried out firebombings and attacks is commanded and run by German secret police?
[02:39:28.425 --> 02:39:34.430]  Kind of like Hal Turner, the top FBI secret agent, confirmed that I told you 10 years ago it was the Fed attacking me every day.
[02:39:35.291 --> 02:39:37.814]  Sticking all the mindless Nazis on me?
[02:39:37.814 --> 02:39:38.776]  I told you he was FBI!
[02:39:38.776 --> 02:39:39.096]  He is!
[02:39:42.608 --> 02:39:48.712]  The same Germans who run the white supremacists so they have an excuse to take all the free speech in Deutschland!
[02:39:48.712 --> 02:39:50.473]  Aha, they know what they're doing!
[02:39:50.473 --> 02:39:59.938]  But then when Kurt Waldheim, the SS officer out of Austria, when he becomes UN head, they defend it, because real Nazis are no problem!
[02:39:59.938 --> 02:40:08.263]  Even the New York Times has had to now admit that the rat line in Paperclip was much bigger and that Joseph Mingler was protected!
[02:40:09.502 --> 02:40:12.343]  You see, we don't care about real Nazis.
[02:40:12.343 --> 02:40:17.525]  But if you don't want government-run eugenics care, we're gonna call you one.
[02:40:17.525 --> 02:40:23.066]  If you don't want to give us all your money, we're gonna call you one and you are politically correct.
[02:40:23.066 --> 02:40:28.508]  So you will rule over and do what we say!
[02:40:28.508 --> 02:40:30.089]  It's so much fun to do it!
[02:40:30.089 --> 02:40:31.549]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[02:40:31.549 --> 02:40:36.571]  It's transforming from a German accent to a Mexican accent.
[02:40:44.383 --> 02:40:54.466]  You gotta laugh at this stuff or you'd cry.
[02:40:54.466 --> 02:40:56.707]  I told you this a long time ago.
[02:40:56.707 --> 02:41:00.088]  The Pentagon official reports say they're never leaving Iraq.
[02:41:00.088 --> 02:41:05.489]  The last troops will leave except for embassies in 2024.
[02:41:05.489 --> 02:41:08.950]  Obama invoice secretly promised to keep troops in Iraq after 2011 till at least 2014.
[02:41:11.738 --> 02:41:12.638]  No, we told you that.
[02:41:12.638 --> 02:41:13.538]  It's all fake.
[02:41:13.538 --> 02:41:16.579]  Hey, it feels good to be a fake liberal, so enjoy it.
[02:41:16.579 --> 02:41:24.221]  Continuing here with some of the other news, Bloomberg is shilling for carbon tax to fight terror.
[02:41:24.221 --> 02:41:25.921]  Oh, Mayor Bloomberg, I like him.
[02:41:25.921 --> 02:41:29.302]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:29.302 --> 02:41:33.623]  He knows how to treat the little people, tell them what to do and how to behave.
[02:41:33.623 --> 02:41:40.745]  I always dreamed of being a dictator, being worshipped like Hitler and Nuremberg or even Jesus, remember, for thousands of years.
[02:41:41.493 --> 02:41:43.033]  Remember that Rolling Stone interview?
[02:41:43.033 --> 02:41:44.394]  ADL gives him awards.
[02:41:44.394 --> 02:41:45.474]  Oh, you like Hitler?
[02:41:45.474 --> 02:41:48.995]  Here's an award.
[02:41:48.995 --> 02:41:53.777]  Mayo Bloomberg claims he doesn't like either party.
[02:41:53.777 --> 02:41:59.199]  Give me a break.
[02:41:59.199 --> 02:42:05.001]  NATO chief says there's no alternative to staying in Afghanistan, even though the CFR says we better get out of there.
[02:42:05.001 --> 02:42:08.842]  Just like General Hamid Gul has told you on this show, just like Lieutenant Colonel
[02:42:09.873 --> 02:42:23.420]  Anthony Schaffer's told you here on this show, this is an operation to produce drugs, black hole to pump money into, and so the bankers don't care, they're gonna keep our troops there, but they're going to get routed.
[02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:24.961]  Nothing can stop that.
[02:42:24.961 --> 02:42:33.426]  So, a lot of empires go to Afghanistan to die, and I guess that's where this empire's going to die.
[02:42:33.426 --> 02:42:37.328]  I guess this Afghan-Pakistan thing is our Barbarossa.
[02:42:38.439 --> 02:42:39.299]  But I say are.
[02:42:39.299 --> 02:42:41.080]  This isn't our military, our government.
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:43.522]  I care about the average troops.
[02:42:43.522 --> 02:42:47.084]  But supporting the troops means not putting them into fake false wars.
[02:42:47.084 --> 02:42:51.746]  But nowadays, it's this fake patriotism of, oh, send them a phone card.
[02:42:51.746 --> 02:42:54.408]  You know, don't get mad about them having to pay for their own medical care.
[02:42:54.408 --> 02:42:57.269]  Don't get mad about the government stealing their death benefits.
[02:42:57.269 --> 02:43:05.754]  Or don't get mad about, no, just feel good and run a flag up on your front yard.
[02:43:05.754 --> 02:43:06.875]  I got a bunch of other news.
[02:43:08.647 --> 02:43:13.432]  I hear that I haven't even gotten into yet.
[02:43:13.432 --> 02:43:16.335]  Get your hands off me, TSA!
[02:43:16.335 --> 02:43:22.182]  These airport so-called security measures amount to state-sponsored sexual harassment.
[02:43:22.182 --> 02:43:24.404]  And that's an article out of the London Guardian.
[02:43:26.667 --> 02:43:27.867]  Very informative.
[02:43:27.867 --> 02:43:30.108]  Let me get into this bill.
[02:43:30.108 --> 02:43:37.851]  A few months ago, we thought we'd beaten it, and the problem is they're trying to ram the DREAM Act through to legalize more illegal aliens.
[02:43:37.851 --> 02:43:44.073]  They already get in-state tuition, all part of the bankrupting of the country, out in California and other states.
[02:43:44.073 --> 02:43:52.436]  And again, it wouldn't even be so bad if we weren't going bankrupt, and if Mexico hadn't lost wars with us, and if they didn't teach the people in Mexico that the U.S.
[02:43:52.436 --> 02:43:53.257]  belongs to them.
[02:43:54.189 --> 02:44:03.963]  I mean, that's why kids in California, even Hispanic kids, can't have American flags on their backpacks or they get sent home from school because the illegal aliens are so offended by it, it's like a vampire seeing a cross!
[02:44:05.034 --> 02:44:09.876]  I mean, why would Mexicans from Mexico want to be Americans instead of Mexicans?
[02:44:09.876 --> 02:44:17.159]  Nothing against the, quote, culture of being Latino or whatever, but, I mean, Mexico is a failed joke.
[02:44:17.159 --> 02:44:21.201]  But, again, political correctness, oh, I'm sorry, I won't wear my American flag.
[02:44:21.201 --> 02:44:32.386]  Here, jerk American flags down at post offices all over the country and run up Mexican flags and kidnap a bunch of us and do whatever you want and then, yes, sir, I'll do whatever you say.
[02:44:33.459 --> 02:44:35.502]  How did I just get off into that?
[02:44:35.502 --> 02:44:42.711]  The point is, Senate Bill S-510, Food Safety Modernization Act vote imminent.
[02:44:42.711 --> 02:44:50.841]  And I saw this from Natural News yesterday, and I thought, hopefully this isn't right, even though Mike Adams is, you know, paramount research, and I totally respect him.
[02:44:51.676 --> 02:45:00.261]  And then I heard the celebrations by the Wicked Ones on NPR today, by the Rockefeller-George Soros operation, about how they're gonna protect our food.
[02:45:00.261 --> 02:45:02.222]  Yeah, they authorize all the GMO.
[02:45:02.222 --> 02:45:05.484]  No studies on the salmon, they just authorize it.
[02:45:05.484 --> 02:45:11.307]  They authorize corn, that in all the studies, the GMO corn varieties cause organ failure in all the rodents.
[02:45:11.307 --> 02:45:14.109]  I mean, that's just confirmed, and they just don't care.
[02:45:14.109 --> 02:45:16.791]  But, you know, they have some big mega agribusiness.
[02:45:16.791 --> 02:45:18.992]  Almost all the problems are from big mega agri.
[02:45:20.930 --> 02:45:26.234]  I mean, I saw reports back in the late 90s of Tyson Chicken would have thousands of violations at one plant.
[02:45:26.234 --> 02:45:29.996]  And then their competition would have one violation and be shut down.
[02:45:29.996 --> 02:45:32.138]  That's how this works.
[02:45:32.138 --> 02:45:33.519]  And this, if you read the bill...
[02:45:34.827 --> 02:45:36.068]  We've done it on air.
[02:45:36.068 --> 02:45:44.997]  You can go read S-510, Senate Bill 510, and it says right there in it that it just gives them unlimited authority to do whatever they want.
[02:45:44.997 --> 02:45:47.540]  They go, well don't worry, we're not going to enforce this on everybody.
[02:45:47.540 --> 02:45:52.425]  It says any preparation, including slicing a tomato, you're not allowed to do it.
[02:45:53.883 --> 02:45:56.323]  And remember what happened in Tulsa, Oklahoma?
[02:45:56.323 --> 02:45:58.504]  They said, you might be growing marijuana in your backyard.
[02:45:58.504 --> 02:46:03.725]  We want license or inspections to make sure preemptively you're not growing marijuana.
[02:46:03.725 --> 02:46:09.326]  And there's all these moves, oh, let's arrest kids or send police out that are selling cupcakes or lemonade.
[02:46:09.326 --> 02:46:12.186]  Or let's give million dollar fines for garage sales.
[02:46:12.186 --> 02:46:14.267]  They don't want any underground economy.
[02:46:14.267 --> 02:46:15.707]  Let's raid a health food store.
[02:46:15.707 --> 02:46:19.327]  Let's raid a farmer's market with cops saying, get your hands up.
[02:46:19.327 --> 02:46:20.708]  All those videos we've shown.
[02:46:20.708 --> 02:46:22.008]  Just, oh my God, these people are,
[02:46:22.788 --> 02:46:28.994]  These people, I mean, we've got to do it.
[02:46:28.994 --> 02:46:34.920]  And so Senate Bill 510, but look, even if they pass this, don't put up with it.
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:36.321]  Ignore them.
[02:46:36.321 --> 02:46:43.428]  But it's designed, I mean, even the FDA tells the farmers, get big or get out.
[02:46:43.428 --> 02:46:47.632]  Get into big agribusiness, consolidate, work for the big agribusiness or get out.
[02:46:49.229 --> 02:46:53.773]  The IRS is getting rid of exemptions for hobby farmers.
[02:46:53.773 --> 02:47:07.783]  Most people that are still farmers in the US that are small, like my family, have a few cows for the tax exemption to keep the property, the agri-exemption, and grow a few crops to just try to get the money to pay the property taxes.
[02:47:07.783 --> 02:47:09.084]  And you still lose money.
[02:47:09.084 --> 02:47:18.272]  So everybody in my family that still lives on the farm or the ranch, we've got your different family pieces all in the same area, they all work at the gas station or at the power plant.
[02:47:19.346 --> 02:47:21.847]  We've gotten rid of hobby farms.
[02:47:42.281 --> 02:47:44.963]  You're not allowed to write off any money you spend on this.
[02:47:44.963 --> 02:47:48.786]  If you don't make money on it, you gotta pay us money on all this.
[02:47:48.786 --> 02:47:51.729]  And so the farms are all just shutting down, the government's just laughing.
[02:47:51.729 --> 02:47:52.990]  Ha ha ha!
[02:47:52.990 --> 02:48:00.276]  Yes, oh yes, we're domesticating them so well.
[02:48:00.276 --> 02:48:00.817]  So people,
[02:48:02.076 --> 02:48:26.352]  People just try to keep having a few cows, try to grow some peas, or some pumpkins, or some squash, or some... The only way to make any money at it is you go out on the weekends, you work seven days a week, you set up on the highway and sell peaches, and I see the articles every few days, SWAT team pulls up, they have an undercover walkover, you sell them peaches in a brown bag, and they get you on the ground, slam your head in the ground, and, you didn't have a license for this!
[02:48:26.352 --> 02:48:31.736]  You didn't pay the fines or fees for the county, and now it's gonna be federal fees and fines.
[02:48:32.716 --> 02:48:36.899]  Did you have a safety inspection of these peaches?
[02:48:36.899 --> 02:48:42.523]  Don't worry if you gas the peaches like they do with pesticides or their GMO.
[02:48:42.523 --> 02:48:43.984]  You know, you can have whatever you want.
[02:48:43.984 --> 02:48:45.425]  It's going to be fine.
[02:48:45.425 --> 02:48:47.386]  But, and hey, you want it?
[02:48:47.386 --> 02:48:48.427]  You want to be slaves?
[02:48:48.427 --> 02:48:48.907]  You got it.
[02:48:48.907 --> 02:48:51.329]  You want government sticking their hands down your pants?
[02:48:51.329 --> 02:48:54.171]  You want government SWAT teaming Amish?
[02:48:54.171 --> 02:48:56.492]  You got it.
[02:48:56.492 --> 02:48:57.473]  You want to be slaves?
[02:49:02.717 --> 02:49:11.243]  It is just, it is just amazing to have all of this going on.
[02:49:11.243 --> 02:49:12.064]  This is bondage.
[02:49:12.064 --> 02:49:17.108]  I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to sit up here and explain to people that this is bondage.
[02:49:17.108 --> 02:49:18.049]  This is tyranny.
[02:49:18.049 --> 02:49:19.390]  This is high-tech tyranny.
[02:49:19.390 --> 02:49:20.510]  This is lunacy.
[02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:23.613]  And they get everybody to just play along with it like it's normal.
[02:49:26.397 --> 02:49:36.125]  I mean, they ship food in from Mexico, where the people are defecating in the fields, and then people get salmonella and e-cola from it.
[02:49:36.125 --> 02:49:41.449]  I've looked into these outbreaks in the school lunch program, the hepatitis and the berries, remember that?
[02:49:41.449 --> 02:49:43.991]  And it's all out of Mexico.
[02:49:43.991 --> 02:49:47.114]  Did you know the beef and food out of Mexico doesn't even really get inspected?
[02:49:47.114 --> 02:49:50.877]  All the inspections are on us, just like the small companies
[02:49:53.294 --> 02:49:59.578]  Have to get the insurance for their employees, but all the big agribusiness and Walmart and McDonald's, they're exempt.
[02:49:59.578 --> 02:50:01.119]  Don't you get it?
[02:50:01.119 --> 02:50:04.961]  You're having financial war waged against you!
[02:50:06.124 --> 02:50:08.605]  You think the rich people that fly on private jets get searched?
[02:50:08.605 --> 02:50:12.147]  They drive right on the airport, no security, right on the plane.
[02:50:12.147 --> 02:50:14.769]  They got mistresses on board to service them.
[02:50:14.769 --> 02:50:17.230]  Literally, I've been at the airport, watched the private jets.
[02:50:17.230 --> 02:50:21.773]  They're running the 20-year-old prostitutes right on the plane.
[02:50:21.773 --> 02:50:23.213]  The execs are piling on.
[02:50:23.213 --> 02:50:25.735]  They're going to have a good time in Chicago or New York tonight.
[02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:30.681]  Meanwhile, you're there with your family, people sticking their hands down your pants.
[02:50:30.681 --> 02:50:33.302]  The executives are robbing everybody, you're just taking off.
[02:50:33.302 --> 02:50:37.424]  They're paying 2.4% tax, you're paying 40%.
[02:50:37.424 --> 02:50:41.545]  They're exempt from the healthcare, they wrote it to bankrupt you.
[02:50:41.545 --> 02:50:43.406]  It's all a big joke, they're mafia.
[02:50:43.646 --> 02:50:44.467]  They're hardcore.
[02:50:44.467 --> 02:50:46.188]  They own both political parties.
[02:50:46.188 --> 02:50:47.029]  They love it.
[02:50:47.029 --> 02:50:48.210]  And they're not going to stop.
[02:50:48.210 --> 02:50:50.993]  They're going to keep driving and driving and driving.
[02:50:50.993 --> 02:50:52.755]  They hope the economy falls apart.
[02:50:52.755 --> 02:50:56.498]  That's in the IMF documents, released 2002, BBC, Greg Palast.
[02:50:56.498 --> 02:50:57.740]  They want to bankrupt it.
[02:50:57.740 --> 02:50:59.461]  They can suck it up even faster then.
[02:50:59.461 --> 02:51:00.783]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.343 --> 02:51:02.664]  Who is Sam Andy?
[02:51:02.664 --> 02:51:05.185]  Sam Andy Foods is life insurance in a can.
[02:51:05.185 --> 02:51:06.826]  Life insurance you can eat.

[02:51:11.348 --> 02:51:12.389]  Why so long?

[02:51:16.751 --> 02:51:19.412]  Foods that last 15 to 25 years.
[02:51:19.412 --> 02:51:24.175]  And that's made us an industry leader among families, sportsmen, outdoorsmen, churches, schools,
[02:51:24.295 --> 02:51:26.136]  People living in remote areas, U.S.
[02:51:26.136 --> 02:51:28.278]  troops in wartime, and many others.

[02:51:57.155 --> 02:51:58.435]  Sam Andy Foods.
[02:51:58.435 --> 02:51:59.636]  Life insurance.
[02:51:59.636 --> 02:52:00.756]  In a can.
[02:52:00.756 --> 02:52:03.137]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:52:03.137 --> 02:52:05.457]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:52:05.457 --> 02:52:08.678]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.678 --> 02:52:13.400]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:18.283]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.283 --> 02:52:20.624]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.624 --> 02:52:23.186]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.186 --> 02:52:26.427]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.427 --> 02:52:34.032]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.372 --> 02:52:39.757]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.757 --> 02:52:42.620]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:46.304]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.304 --> 02:52:47.385]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.385 --> 02:52:48.726]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.726 --> 02:52:50.207]  Invisible Empire.

[02:52:59.952 --> 02:53:04.033]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:53:04.033 --> 02:53:08.535]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:53:08.535 --> 02:53:14.697]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:53:14.697 --> 02:53:17.118]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:53:17.118 --> 02:53:23.100]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:26.643]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:53:26.643 --> 02:53:28.504]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:53:28.504 --> 02:53:30.686]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:53:30.686 --> 02:53:35.570]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:53:35.570 --> 02:53:36.391]  Guaranteed.

[02:53:49.441 --> 02:53:50.261]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[02:54:18.747 --> 02:54:26.795]  Well, there's a bunch of other news here.
[02:54:26.795 --> 02:54:27.716]  I'm gonna hit some of it now.
[02:54:27.716 --> 02:54:29.057]  We won't have time for any other calls.
[02:54:29.057 --> 02:54:32.321]  I apologize, but I'll be back live tomorrow and on Friday.
[02:54:32.321 --> 02:54:35.464]  We got some big guests lined up tomorrow and on Friday.
[02:54:35.464 --> 02:54:39.228]  Be sure and join us and continue to spread the word about the transmission.
[02:54:39.228 --> 02:54:40.989]  We're really starting to have a big effect.
[02:54:40.989 --> 02:54:42.191]  Thanks to everybody taking action.
[02:54:43.612 --> 02:54:46.754]  Here's that article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:46.754 --> 02:54:53.599]  Rockefeller insider vowed in 1969, travel will be more difficult.
[02:54:53.599 --> 02:54:57.782]  And related to it's our article, Homeland Security trying to shut down air travel.
[02:54:57.782 --> 02:55:01.644]  Yeah, the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:55:01.644 --> 02:55:03.826]  Just like Rome controlled the roads and commerce.
[02:55:04.841 --> 02:55:06.582]  This is a big precedent-setting event.
[02:55:06.582 --> 02:55:10.085]  The Feds are saying, we're going to hire minimum-wage security guards that can do whatever they want.
[02:55:10.085 --> 02:55:11.706]  Something police can't do.
[02:55:11.706 --> 02:55:13.928]  Police can't randomly stick their hands down your pants.
[02:55:13.928 --> 02:55:14.569]  Nobody can.
[02:55:14.569 --> 02:55:15.389]  It's a crime.
[02:55:15.389 --> 02:55:17.511]  That's why a DA's vowed to prosecute.
[02:55:17.511 --> 02:55:18.932]  Congress is moving against it.
[02:55:18.932 --> 02:55:23.475]  And yes, the private corporations will load up more bombs and blow up a few planes.
[02:55:23.475 --> 02:55:29.220]  And either you wake up to stage terror, and finance provocateur terror, or you give in to them.
[02:55:31.997 --> 02:55:38.479]  Like sheep, humanity had better adjust to constant harassment as long as it tolerates globalist control.
[02:55:38.479 --> 02:55:48.483]  In 1969, the Rockefeller insider Richard Day predicted, in the future, in these terms, travel would become very restricted, people would need permission to travel, and they would need a good reason to travel.
[02:55:48.483 --> 02:55:53.385]  If they didn't have a good reason for your travel, you would not be allowed to travel, and everyone would need an ID.
[02:55:53.385 --> 02:56:00.328]  Later on, some sort of device would be developed to be implanted under the skin that would be called specifically encoded to identify that individual.
[02:56:00.328 --> 02:56:00.828]  What it done,
[02:56:01.408 --> 02:56:03.690]  Rockefeller tell Aaron Russo.
[02:56:03.690 --> 02:56:08.914]  He told him, everybody's going to have a chip, but the elite's chip is going to say, kiss my rumpus.
[02:56:08.914 --> 02:56:12.736]  It's going to say, I'm above the law.
[02:56:12.736 --> 02:56:18.561]  By the way, Napolitano and Pistol, the head of the TSA, have now said that they go through pat-downs.
[02:56:18.561 --> 02:56:20.842]  I look this up and that's a lie.
[02:56:20.842 --> 02:56:24.385]  They both fly on private government jets.
[02:56:24.385 --> 02:56:26.847]  They pull in in black SUVs and get on board.
[02:56:28.103 --> 02:56:31.426]  Just like all the rest of General Aviation, what liars!
[02:56:31.426 --> 02:56:35.069]  They just lie, lie, lie!
[02:56:35.069 --> 02:56:37.831]  If your neighbor lied like this, you wouldn't associate with them.
[02:56:37.831 --> 02:56:40.573]  If your boss lied like this, you would quit.
[02:56:40.573 --> 02:56:44.036]  If your wife lied to you, your husband, you'd divorce them!
[02:56:44.036 --> 02:56:45.177]  I mean, they just vomit lies on us!
[02:56:49.088 --> 02:56:50.849]  These people are crooks!
[02:56:50.849 --> 02:56:51.929]  These people are scum!
[02:56:51.929 --> 02:56:53.950]  They're abusive thugs!
[02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:59.232]  Pelosi, that painted trollop, has now been elected minority leader again.
[02:56:59.232 --> 02:57:00.072]  Good!
[02:57:00.072 --> 02:57:06.194]  She's super unpopular and a great sign of Marie Antoinette arrogance.
[02:57:06.194 --> 02:57:06.995]  So that's good.
[02:57:06.995 --> 02:57:07.655]  Keep her in there.
[02:57:07.655 --> 02:57:09.295]  That's excellent.
[02:57:09.295 --> 02:57:10.936]  That's excellent.
[02:57:10.936 --> 02:57:13.577]  She'll be just as big a wake-up as Obama and Bush were.
[02:57:18.388 --> 02:57:22.431]  Sweet drinks, national sales tax cut.
[02:57:22.431 --> 02:57:31.278]  Now, they always start with something that's seen as unpopular, like, oh, let's ban free speech in Europe just for Nazis, and then it's for everybody.
[02:57:31.278 --> 02:57:34.461]  Oh, let's just put a national tax on bad things.
[02:57:36.553 --> 02:57:39.795]  And then once that precedent's set, they can do it to everything.
[02:57:39.795 --> 02:57:43.357]  Soda pop sales, tax target to cut deficit.
[02:57:43.357 --> 02:57:45.479]  What has the IMF and World Bank called for?
[02:57:45.479 --> 02:57:54.985]  They've said, you will, Barbaroso, you will, and Von Ruppe, who says nation states are dead earlier this week.
[02:57:54.985 --> 02:57:55.865]  What have they said?
[02:57:55.865 --> 02:57:58.107]  They said, we need VAT.
[02:57:58.107 --> 02:58:01.349]  We need sales taxes to fund this new world government.
[02:58:01.349 --> 02:58:02.609]  Now out in the open.
[02:58:02.609 --> 02:58:04.811]  And so they're going to start with something that everybody knows is bad.
[02:58:06.872 --> 02:58:08.520]  Corn syrup's bad.
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:09.605]  Soda pop's bad.
[02:58:09.605 --> 02:58:11.052]  But where does it end?
[02:58:12.091 --> 02:58:14.672]  Warning of a death spiral without drastic changes.
[02:58:14.672 --> 02:58:15.932]  A group of experts in the U.S.
[02:58:15.932 --> 02:58:24.414]  federal deficit on Wednesday called for a 2011 Social Security tax holiday, a soft drink tax, and government spending freezes.
[02:58:24.414 --> 02:58:25.134]  Oh, see?
[02:58:25.134 --> 02:58:30.415]  Oh, we're gonna give you a little tax cut on the income tax, but start up a parallel sales tax.
[02:58:30.415 --> 02:58:32.376]  How many years have I told you?
[02:58:32.376 --> 02:58:33.436]  Over a decade.
[02:58:33.436 --> 02:58:36.477]  They're going to have an income tax and a sales tax.
[02:58:36.477 --> 02:58:37.337]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:37.337 --> 02:58:39.497]  Retransmission starts now with key info.
[02:58:39.497 --> 02:58:40.758]  See you back live tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[02:58:40.758 --> 02:58:41.598]  InfoWars.com.
