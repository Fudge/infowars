[00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:02.741]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:06.065]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:20.457]  We are now simulcasting the last few hours at PrisonPlanet.TV for radio listeners that want the added dimension of seeing the documents, the articles, the video clips visually that we play here.
[00:00:20.977 --> 00:00:22.457]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:33.200]  Webster Carpley coming up in 52 minutes with a host of key issues including his prediction he believes are getting ready to launch some type of false flag internet terror attack.
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.621]  As a pretext to pass the cybersecurity takeover bill.
[00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:38.202]  It's now been declassified.
[00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:38.562]  U.S.
[00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:46.785]  plans to fight the net revealed, including in the U.S., attacking anyone that criticizes the Internet, anybody that exposes government corruption.
[00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:48.866]  I mean, we already knew this, but now it's out in the open.
[00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:53.687]  BBC, Politico, Infowars.com wrote an article about it.
[00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:54.888]  The Register.
[00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.168]  So that's all coming up.
[00:00:56.188 --> 00:01:02.591]  It's just part of what Tarpley, one of our resident experts, economist, doctor of history,
[00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:04.192]  We'll be discussing with us.
[00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:06.975]  Also, don't forget, we're selling out of this quick.
[00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:09.778]  The first printing already sold out, but we bought a bunch knowing that would happen.
[00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:15.263]  The second printing, as of two days ago, it already sold 70 plus percent of what they had.
[00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:19.628]  So we're getting an order in for the third printing.
[00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:20.909]  It'll be done in about three weeks.
[00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.331]  We should be out by then.
[00:01:24.142 --> 00:01:29.263]  Nowhere can you get a deal on Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell, American Conspiracy's book.
[00:01:29.803 --> 00:01:32.124]  Hard-hitting, already a bestseller, one weekend.
[00:01:32.144 --> 00:01:34.184]  It's in the top ten of all the charts.
[00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:35.885]  Went as high as number two on Amazon.
[00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:38.425]  American Conspiracy, $19.95.
[00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.166]  It's $24.95 in bookstores.
[00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:45.147]  But we also add, it's like a Ginsu knife ad, but it's true.
[00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:47.807]  Buy one set of Ginsu knives, get another free.
[00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:50.468]  You get two different films.
[00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:57.834]  You can choose from two different films, Loose Change Final Cut, an excellent 9-11 film, or Reflections and Warnings, my interview with Aaron Russo documentary.
[00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:01.518]  Get one of those films free with the book and the books discounted by $5.
[00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:02.579]  That's a $44.95 value for $19.95.
[00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.199]  That is more than 50% off.
[00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:10.585]  How do you divide that?
[00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:11.646]  I know it's more than 50.
[00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:12.386]  What is that?
[00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:12.846]  60% off?
[00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:13.346]  Or 55% off?
[00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:27.269]  If it's $44.95 and we're selling it for $19.95, that value, then yeah, we're talking about over 50% off on the book at InfoWars.com and your purchase of the books and videos is how we fund the websites, the films.
[00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.490]  Plus, you can read the book, give it to somebody.
[00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.232]  You may know all about 9-11 or Aaron Russo and the Federal Reserve.
[00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:35.353]  Give them the film.
[00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:40.196]  Infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:02:40.336 --> 00:02:40.756]  Okay.
[00:02:42.897 --> 00:02:45.479]  Kevin Booth, four or five years in the making.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.340]  Great filmmaker.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.462]  He made the documentary American Drug War.
[00:02:51.658 --> 00:02:56.259]  And it aired on Showtime, one of their most popular shows of the year, they reported.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.480]  Got high ratings.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.461]  And he really made part two of American Drug War.
[00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:02.982]  It's called How Weed Won the West.
[00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:07.623]  Fourteen states passed laws saying this is decriminalized, the feds don't care.
[00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:13.225]  Obama says he's going to go ahead and legalize, then he comes in and orders 90 plus percent of the dispensaries.
[00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:24.362]  in uh... major cities in california shut down so that's how they operate they lie to you and stab you in the back but here's the issue i've smoked pot in high school and college i don't really like it
[00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:29.250]  But I know that it impairs you a lot less than alcohol and doesn't eat your liver.
[00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.553]  I know it has hundreds of documented glaucoma, cancer, eating disorders.
[00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:42.138]  Studies show that Prozac isn't as good for depression as placebo, but marijuana is much better than placebo.
[00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:43.338]  And I'm not saying smoke it.
[00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.221]  I know a lot of lazy people who are probably already lazy, not even lazy, are smoking pot.
[00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:53.907]  The reason we're talking about this is the fake drug war is the way the system takes control of our society.
[00:03:53.947 --> 00:04:00.430]  It's the foundation of the snitches, the spies, the federalized police, the warrantless searches, the checkpoints.
[00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.955]  When you make alcohol illegal in the 20s, it tripled the amount of alcohol poisoning and alcoholism.
[00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:10.937]  It empowered the mafia, corrupted the police.
[00:04:11.057 --> 00:04:11.937]  No one debates this.
[00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:12.738]  This is admitted fact.
[00:04:14.642 --> 00:04:16.603]  Some European countries have decriminalized drugs.
[00:04:16.984 --> 00:04:18.885]  Drug use drops on average by more than half.
[00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:20.747]  The crime goes down.
[00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:26.691]  Because now you just go to a government facility or a clinic and they treat you like a sick person.
[00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:27.932]  You get your heroin or whatever.
[00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:30.634]  Or they get you on methadone or whatever.
[00:04:30.674 --> 00:04:33.956]  And now you're not robbing people's stereos or mugging them to get your heroin.
[00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:37.079]  So across the board I say decriminalize.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.883]  Again, 80 plus years ago when you could buy cocaine, Coca-Cola,
[00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.051]  Opium, laudanum, heroin.
[00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:51.353]  You had much fewer people, and this is admitted in mainline history, using illegal drugs.
[00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:52.514]  You make it illegal.
[00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:54.034]  Hollywood makes it glamorous.
[00:04:54.074 --> 00:04:55.315]  People get involved in it.
[00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:56.395]  They use it.
[00:04:57.016 --> 00:04:58.636]  It empowers the drug gangs.
[00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:01.698]  Mexico is collapsing because of drug prohibition.
[00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:03.939]  No one's debating that.
[00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.940]  19,000 people killed the last three years.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.640]  That's the State Department's own numbers.
[00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:08.561]  U.S.
[00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.162]  Embassy staff, what, four people killed two days ago.
[00:05:11.862 --> 00:05:13.323]  They're killing cops in the U.S.
[00:05:15.527 --> 00:05:20.291]  None of the drug rings that are government-run and some that aren't government-run, they all want to keep it illegal.
[00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:21.872]  So it's a no-brainer.
[00:05:22.373 --> 00:05:23.334]  De-criminalize.
[00:05:23.354 --> 00:05:25.315]  That doesn't mean you sell it at 7-Eleven.
[00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:31.180]  I remember in high school, I didn't even really like pot, but it was easier to get than beer.
[00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:32.922]  Beer was what I liked.
[00:05:33.977 --> 00:05:36.079]  And because there was such controls over alcohol.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.000]  It's the same thing.
[00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:41.265]  You treat marijuana like alcohol, there's going to be less of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:42.766]  But I'm done ranting about that.
[00:05:43.187 --> 00:05:46.410]  The point is, people need to get How Weed Won the West.
[00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.095]  You can get it in a combo deal with americadrugwardiscountedatinfowars.com.
[00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:53.878]  But I wanted to go to Kevin Booth, and look, I know we've got
[00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:58.143]  Thinker, Bill, Curtis, Matt, Robert, and others.
[00:05:58.663 --> 00:06:01.985]  I'll give you each about a minute, because I know you're probably not on subject when we go to you.
[00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:07.067]  But then after that, only calls about the fake drug war, or do you agree with us, do you disagree?
[00:06:07.087 --> 00:06:08.128]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:06:08.988 --> 00:06:15.911]  And I want to talk about a host of issues here today with Kevin Booth.
[00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.392]  Kevin, good to have you on with us.
[00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:18.972]  Thanks again, Alex.
[00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:20.113]  Thanks so much for having me on.
[00:06:20.153 --> 00:06:21.394]  And I'd just like to back that up.
[00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:24.575]  It's funny, when I think back to my days back in high school,
[00:06:25.434 --> 00:06:39.399]  Uh, I didn't like marijuana at all, but I smoked it anyways, uh, just because you almost had to if you wanted to be considered cool or to be accepted into any of, like, the cool in-groups of kids.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.462]  Yeah, let's say you're over, you know, you're 17, you're at the cheerleader's house, and she pulls out some marijuana.
[00:06:46.522 --> 00:06:48.543]  She's not gonna think you're cool unless you smoke it with her.
[00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.280]  No, you absolutely have to.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.084]  I'm sure if you go to Amsterdam right now, there's no way that that kind of behavior is taking place.
[00:06:55.204 --> 00:07:00.708]  I mean, the point is, is that kids and people are always going to do exactly what you tell them not to do.
[00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:02.710]  And in a way, the government knows that also.
[00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.833]  So, I mean, they're playing this thing on so many different levels.
[00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:11.137]  But just to back up to something else you're talking about, you know, I truly believe that there's no way
[00:07:11.937 --> 00:07:15.999]  In the world, they could have pulled off this New World Order agenda without the drug war.
[00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:19.420]  I mean, they had to dumb everybody down.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:26.803]  They had to make this more about than just going to wars with other countries and economics.
[00:07:26.843 --> 00:07:30.704]  They had to actually start fiddling with society's brain chemistry.
[00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:31.745]  And that's what they've done.
[00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:38.247]  I mean, the government is basically controlling a huge percentage of our brain chemistry.
[00:07:40.202 --> 00:07:44.003]  Well, I've had countless medical doctors and toxicologists and neurologists on.
[00:07:44.404 --> 00:07:46.885]  Ritalin, Prozac, all those different classes of drugs.
[00:07:47.445 --> 00:07:49.526]  The molecules are incredibly deadly.
[00:07:49.566 --> 00:07:50.366]  They're toxic.
[00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:56.508]  I mean, you know, the heart swelling, brain shrinking, brain damage, suicide.
[00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:01.810]  And then meanwhile, marijuana has a lot more attributes than some of the negatives that I've seen.
[00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:07.673]  And the point is, it's an excuse to put everybody... I mean, I remember back in the 60s and 70s reading stories from then.
[00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:14.415]  Wasn't around in the 60s, but reading about it, where people get 50 years in prison for an ounce of marijuana?
[00:08:15.215 --> 00:08:20.157]  Oh yeah, I mean, I think the first guy went to jail for almost life for a joint or something like that.
[00:08:20.197 --> 00:08:23.338]  I forget his name, but he was like the first marijuana prisoner ever.
[00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:24.018]  You could look it up.
[00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:32.212]  Well, look, they know humans for tens of thousands of years have been taking drugs, taking mushrooms, fermenting grapes.
[00:08:32.552 --> 00:08:34.013]  People like to mess with their brain.
[00:08:34.553 --> 00:08:36.334]  We're a very addictive species.
[00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:37.535]  And they know that.
[00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:39.295]  And how do they make people slaves?
[00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:40.676]  Governments have always wanted slavery.
[00:08:40.996 --> 00:08:44.618]  But they can't just say we have slavery now without giving it an excuse.
[00:08:44.638 --> 00:08:46.199]  So they put out all these chemicals.
[00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:48.880]  The CIA introduced LSD.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.741]  The CIA introduced cocaine into the illegal market.
[00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:53.402]  That's been admitted.
[00:08:54.182 --> 00:08:58.123]  Knowing people will get it, they will get addicted, and now they've got an excuse to put you in a slave camp.
[00:08:59.224 --> 00:09:04.966]  Well, I think it's an interesting point, too, that you make in the film, where you're talking about the thing that they can't stand about marijuana.
[00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:10.827]  Even with cocaine and heroin, the government and the CIA can control those things because they're very centralized.
[00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:18.830]  Cocaine can only be grown in only a handful of places on the entire planet, mostly in, you know, South America, Peru, Colombia, etc.
[00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.771]  It has to be an exact type of condition
[00:09:22.335 --> 00:09:29.317]  Poppies will grow everywhere, but the kind of poppies that I understand will grow, that will grow actual heroin, will only grow in very specific places.
[00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:31.358]  Marijuana grows everywhere.
[00:09:31.378 --> 00:09:32.899]  It grows in almost every country.
[00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:36.840]  It grows everywhere, and that's why they can't stand it.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.181]  And that's why it's still Schedule 1 when things like heroin and cocaine are Schedule 2.
[00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:46.123]  I mean, the government actually is telling us that heroin and cocaine are safer than marijuana.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.041]  Well, let's expand on that.
[00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:50.803]  I saw the statistic in the Statesman two days ago.
[00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:55.326]  100 million Americans are admitted marijuana smokers.
[00:09:56.006 --> 00:10:00.890]  Now, if you look at the statistics of who's tried it, they report it's over 200 million.
[00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.032]  So, two-thirds of people, every cop listening out there is younger than 50.
[00:10:05.173 --> 00:10:07.694]  I'll bet you a million bucks that
[00:10:09.713 --> 00:10:11.676]  That they have smoked marijuana.
[00:10:12.116 --> 00:10:18.324]  You know, my grandfather, when he was dying of cancer and real nauseated with chemo, his buddy, the sheriff,
[00:10:19.358 --> 00:10:21.539]  Showed up and said, Jerry, smoke some of this.
[00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:23.059]  I hear it makes you be able to eat food.
[00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:24.620]  He said, no, I just want to die.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.480]  You know, it was about a month before he died.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.701]  No, no, no, this is too painful.
[00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:31.102]  I'm not going to smoke that devil weed, basically.
[00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:36.943]  But, you know, the issue here is, is that the cops knew this stuff 20, 30 years ago.
[00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:39.244]  They know, they know what's going on.
[00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:48.187]  And if you've got 86 percent of illegal drug users only use marijuana, where's the drug war going to go if they don't have that 86 percent to put in prison?
[00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:56.343]  What's interesting about it, too, is that they've tried to demonize the medical use of marijuana by saying, well, smoking anything is bad for you.
[00:10:56.363 --> 00:11:00.286]  Meanwhile, there's still ads for Camel and Rolling Stone Magazine everywhere.
[00:11:01.706 --> 00:11:02.767]  Cigarettes are still legal.
[00:11:03.347 --> 00:11:14.734]  But the point is that more and more people are coming out and saying they want to have the health benefits of cannabinoids and things that come from taking cannabis without getting high.
[00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:20.355]  You know, in the medical marijuana movement, don't really want to walk around getting high.
[00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:22.137]  It's really not about getting high.
[00:11:22.157 --> 00:11:25.659]  It's about enjoying the health benefits from this plant.
[00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:28.160]  And now they're discovering new ways of ingesting it.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.624]  There's this thing called CDCs, where you actually eat the lower water leaves off the plant every day.
[00:11:33.704 --> 00:11:34.945]  Put them in your salad or whatever.
[00:11:34.965 --> 00:11:38.947]  It has incredible, incredible health benefits with inflammation.
[00:11:38.967 --> 00:11:40.268]  Look it up, CDCs.
[00:11:42.296 --> 00:11:49.481]  No, I mean, there's no doubt that cannabis is one of God's gifts, and it can certainly be abused.
[00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:52.743]  I mean, you could eat 20 heads of lettuce and bust your gut.
[00:11:52.783 --> 00:11:55.665]  I mean, you could drink 10 gallons of water and hurt yourself.
[00:11:56.005 --> 00:11:57.766]  We'll be right back with Kevin Booth.
[00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:03.320]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.522]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:06.382]  Don't!
[00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:09.865]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:12:10.286 --> 00:12:19.053]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[00:12:19.373 --> 00:12:23.076]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:03.047]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[00:13:03.287 --> 00:13:08.489]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:16.272]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion, the value of the U.S.
[00:13:16.312 --> 00:13:18.193]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[00:13:18.373 --> 00:13:22.855]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need to act today.

[00:13:37.102 --> 00:13:40.525]  There's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[00:13:40.746 --> 00:13:51.536]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.

[00:14:00.902 --> 00:14:04.569]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:14:04.909 --> 00:14:07.935]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:14:08.175 --> 00:14:09.598]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:14:10.296 --> 00:14:12.957]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:19.158]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:24.379]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:34.542]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:14:34.642 --> 00:14:36.764]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:14:37.004 --> 00:14:38.325]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:14:38.585 --> 00:14:40.867]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:42.909]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:14:43.169 --> 00:14:47.994]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:10.246]  Yeah, here's the New York Times article.
[00:16:10.286 --> 00:16:12.086]  We always document what we claim here.
[00:16:13.046 --> 00:16:13.286]  March 11, 2007.
[00:16:13.426 --> 00:16:15.787]  Give me a document, Kim.
[00:16:16.127 --> 00:16:17.647]  Shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:21.968]  A man sentenced to life in prison 17 years ago.
[00:16:22.408 --> 00:16:23.348]  Just 17 years ago.
[00:16:23.368 --> 00:16:24.908]  This was 20 years ago now.
[00:16:25.808 --> 00:16:26.469]  This is from 2007.
[00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:34.330]  A man sentenced to life in prison 17 years ago after smoking marijuana while on probation for his part in an armed robbery is set to be free.
[00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:38.057]  So, smoking marijuana.
[00:16:38.657 --> 00:16:41.319]  But that's a more modern case, and that's for breaking parole.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.623]  The bigger issue here is, I've seen cases for just the marijuana 50 years in prison.
[00:16:48.063 --> 00:16:48.603]  Kevin Booth.
[00:16:49.684 --> 00:16:53.867]  The point is, is that I doubt he did the robbery while he was high.
[00:16:54.147 --> 00:17:03.873]  And I know that's an old cliché, and there's several clichés that have to be said over and over again, because they're so ridiculous, but you have to keep repeating it about the death statistics.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:14.224]  But first of all, when the police talk about people committing violent crimes while high, most likely they're also extremely drunk at the same time, and they just found some THC in their blood.
[00:17:15.144 --> 00:17:26.289]  And, you know, when the DEA and the Narcotics Task Force survey, they talk about the statistic about how marijuana is by far the most harmful and destructive drug out there.
[00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.549]  Well, I figured out how they come about that number.
[00:17:28.609 --> 00:17:29.250]  It's real easy.
[00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.511]  If you go to any kind of like treatment center, jail, or anything like that,
[00:17:32.932 --> 00:17:33.512]  We're good to go.
[00:17:51.638 --> 00:18:05.406]  Well, it's a gateway drug because they make it illegal and lump it in with cocaine and heroin, so people then get into the circles that are already doing illegal things.
[00:18:06.066 --> 00:18:09.509]  No, exactly, and that's what this whole dispensary thing is all about right now.
[00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:15.252]  Whether people think this whole medical marijuana is just a front to get high or whatever, at least it's a way
[00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:18.368]  of taking marijuana out of the criminal's hands.
[00:18:37.796 --> 00:18:40.517]  Well, I mean, maybe that's what the government wants us to do.
[00:18:40.637 --> 00:18:44.857]  Maybe the government wants us to buy products that they can tax and then kill ourselves.
[00:18:44.977 --> 00:18:45.337]  I don't know.
[00:18:45.577 --> 00:18:49.978]  I was talking to a lobbyist a few weeks ago, works at the Texas Capitol, and he was saying, oh, no, it's true.
[00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:55.579]  The alcohol lobby and the cigarette lobby are some of the biggest donors to keep marijuana illegal.
[00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:56.380]  Why is that, Kevin?
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.160]  Of course, because they, you know, because they would lose so much.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.941]  I mean, if marijuana were legal across the board,
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:11.061]  So many people would smoke pot instead of drinking beer, or smoke a little weed instead of smoking cigarettes.
[00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:12.122]  It's just obvious.
[00:19:12.282 --> 00:19:13.022]  Painfully obvious.
[00:19:13.682 --> 00:19:28.125]  Well, on the National Archives, you can pull up notes to George Washington's care for his toothaches, and they're telling him, smoke this variety of hemp, which is the variety that has the THC.
[00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:30.386]  So, George Washington was smoking it.
[00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:32.046]  I guess he deserves life in prison.
[00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:42.706]  Well, and that alone should be the only reason if some people out there who are still thinking, you know, like, oh, it makes people dumb, makes people hide, used to say illegal.
[00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:42.966]  No.
[00:19:42.986 --> 00:19:47.711]  I mean, if the founding father did it and wrote about it, that's case closed.
[00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:48.732]  It's argument over.
[00:19:49.353 --> 00:19:50.354]  And they know that.
[00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:51.615]  Either that or go live somewhere else.
[00:19:51.655 --> 00:19:53.617]  If the founding father of our country
[00:19:58.184 --> 00:19:58.784]  He grew it!
[00:19:58.844 --> 00:20:01.747]  He grew the type of marijuana, not just hemp.
[00:20:01.987 --> 00:20:02.527]  And that's another thing.
[00:20:02.707 --> 00:20:06.450]  They banned in the country all the hemp that has no THC, that's better than cotton.
[00:20:07.391 --> 00:20:09.092]  I mean, it's something farmers can grow anywhere.
[00:20:09.372 --> 00:20:15.917]  The cotton lobbies lobbied to have it banned because they then had machines that could remove and strip and use it.
[00:20:16.177 --> 00:20:18.139]  So they said, oh my God, let's ban this.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.480]  No, of course not.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.661]  Why don't they at least legalize the hemp?
[00:20:22.281 --> 00:20:29.083]  Well, because I think they feel like if they legalize hemp, then everybody can grow marijuana and no one's going to know the difference.
[00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:37.745]  But also then, hemp will, you know, I think when they came out with polyester, I think that was another big lobby against it.
[00:20:37.785 --> 00:20:39.305]  You know, the big polyester movement.
[00:20:39.425 --> 00:20:41.566]  You know, maybe a little bit before your time.
[00:20:42.516 --> 00:20:46.577]  When I was growing up, all of a sudden, everyone wanted to wear polyester clothing.
[00:20:46.597 --> 00:20:50.938]  That was the thing, and supposedly that had a lot to do with wanting to keep hemp out of the market.
[00:20:51.659 --> 00:20:56.640]  Yeah, Dow Chemical and DuPont lobbied in the 30s to get the drug laws passed.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:10.244]  I want to talk about how we'd want the West to take some phone calls, Kevin, when we come back, because the film covers a whole host of issues and is a lot more hardcore on government drug dealing and everything else than even American drug war, though the name...
[00:21:11.204 --> 00:21:11.404]  Is it?
[00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:42.746]  Prescription fish oil prescription and they want to use the same type marijuana laws to do it So folks they've built up this grid and they're gonna try to use it to keep you from getting your vitamins and minerals So they're not gonna stop there big pharma wants to knock out its competition.
[00:21:43.126 --> 00:21:47.027]  It's following the drug war paradigm Playbook to get that job done.
[00:21:47.048 --> 00:21:48.288]  We'll be right back with Kevin Booth.
[00:21:48.388 --> 00:21:56.992]  I'm Alex Jones We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:03.655]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:12.117]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.

[00:22:57.895 --> 00:23:02.118]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:23:02.438 --> 00:23:03.059]  Number one.
[00:23:03.359 --> 00:23:06.521]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:07.342]  Number two.
[00:23:07.642 --> 00:23:12.205]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:12.985]  It's true.
[00:23:13.286 --> 00:23:17.829]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:18.129 --> 00:23:18.669]  Number 3.
[00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.252]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:22.552 --> 00:23:26.295]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:27.015]  Number 4.
[00:23:27.255 --> 00:23:29.637]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:33.419]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:33.900]  Number 5.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.403]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:38.623 --> 00:23:43.407]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:24:21.556 --> 00:24:23.517]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:24:23.717 --> 00:24:26.439]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:24:26.619 --> 00:24:34.185]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.

[00:24:48.068 --> 00:24:49.129]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:14.071]  Well, this is fitting music.
[00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:16.574]  Folks, it's a joke.
[00:25:18.756 --> 00:25:24.503]  They just demonize everything as a pretext to get regular people in the criminal justice system.
[00:25:24.803 --> 00:25:28.267]  And when they made marijuana illegal, a lot more people started using it.
[00:25:29.335 --> 00:25:33.858]  If you go back into the 30s, and before that the 20s, it was very few people.
[00:25:34.498 --> 00:25:39.281]  Some Hispanics in the Southwest, black communities smoked it some.
[00:25:39.301 --> 00:25:40.222]  It was called reefer.
[00:25:41.022 --> 00:25:45.445]  That's the term they used for reefer madness, where it shows people murdering everybody when they smoke marijuana.
[00:25:45.465 --> 00:25:49.988]  And then they made it illegal, and now it's one of the most popular drugs in use.
[00:25:50.168 --> 00:25:51.789]  Now, it has a lot of medical uses.
[00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.512]  There's no other plant we know of that has this many uses.
[00:25:55.572 --> 00:25:57.513]  I mean, it's really an incredible plant.
[00:25:59.565 --> 00:26:07.295]  But I want to go to some of your phone calls here from Anti-Federalists Ruth and others that are patiently holding the toll-free number 1-800-259-9231.
[00:26:07.335 --> 00:26:11.380]  I have some other callers that we're holding from earlier.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.120]  We'll go to them too.
[00:26:12.981 --> 00:26:16.085]  But Kevin, other points you want to make about how we won the West.
[00:26:16.105 --> 00:26:17.667]  I mean, this is also a Tenth Amendment.
[00:26:18.464 --> 00:26:23.006]  No, I mean, it's completely almost like medieval, like the old days of having people come from the kingdom to tax you.
[00:26:47.486 --> 00:26:51.309]  People out here in California are thousands of miles away from Washington, D.C.
[00:26:52.590 --> 00:27:10.843]  just trying to live their lives and survive economically any way that they can, and treat their illnesses the best that they know how, and having the feds come in over and over again, and even regardless of what Obama said, the DEA has just been in town just within the last week or so busting people again.
[00:27:11.323 --> 00:27:13.225]  They're said to be trying to shut down over 900 of the 1,000 dispensaries right now.
[00:27:17.176 --> 00:27:19.097]  It is a war out here right now.
[00:27:19.217 --> 00:27:22.239]  I mean, there's war on the streets right now with what these people are doing.
[00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:31.605]  You know, and what's funny, too, when you're talking about how Reaper was unknown, you know, you always talk about how the New World Order plan, it like backfires on them.
[00:27:32.005 --> 00:27:42.551]  Well, the whole marijuana thing has backfired on them, too, because what they've done, you know, by putting it into mainstream culture and demonizing it and making it cool and all those things you talk about,
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:53.909]  Is they've also created an entire society of people, a whole generation of people that have become expert growers and have now cultivated marijuana up into new heights.
[00:27:54.049 --> 00:28:04.237]  And you know, and we compare marijuana now to like the fine wine vineyards of Northern California where you have all these different strains and these people that all take pride in their strains.
[00:28:04.317 --> 00:28:09.181]  And you know, you could go to the different ranches up there in the Emerald Triangle and everybody has their own little way of doing things.
[00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:15.643]  You know, and this is all a result from them trying to outlaw it and demonize it.
[00:28:15.663 --> 00:28:23.745]  So, you know, I think history repeats itself, and anytime you try to squash people like this, it's just gonna rise up.
[00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:33.188]  And the DEA still comes out and they'll say, well, the marijuana today is 70% stronger than it was back in the 60s, you know, and that's another reason why it should be so bad.
[00:28:33.268 --> 00:28:37.829]  Yeah, but now the pot smokers I know, they just take one or two hits instead of smoking three joints.
[00:28:38.248 --> 00:28:40.850]  Exactly, because it's the smoke that's bad for you, okay?
[00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.811]  Smoking anything is bad for you, you know?
[00:28:43.071 --> 00:28:47.494]  I mean, uh, you know, because anything like this dust, you know, breathing dust is bad for you.
[00:28:47.534 --> 00:28:50.356]  Putting anything in your lungs is bad for you, yeah.
[00:28:50.416 --> 00:28:59.743]  So the whole thing is that the new marijuana is cleaned, if you get the good stuff, it's organic, it's not grown with chemicals, and you just take one or two hits.
[00:28:59.763 --> 00:29:01.364]  A lot of people use vaporizers now.
[00:29:02.126 --> 00:29:09.029]  And, uh, you know, it's not anything, you know, you'd have to smoke a hundred joints probably to equal a pack of cigarettes.
[00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.350]  As far as just lung damage goes.
[00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.512]  Well, regardless, the government is laundering the hard drug money.
[00:29:15.552 --> 00:29:16.953]  They're on record dealing it.
[00:29:17.733 --> 00:29:19.654]  And it's time for everybody to come out.
[00:29:19.934 --> 00:29:21.275]  Ventura's doing it in his book.
[00:29:21.575 --> 00:29:22.455]  You're doing it in your film.
[00:29:22.495 --> 00:29:23.576]  And just say, stop it.
[00:29:24.156 --> 00:29:24.756]  We know.
[00:29:24.776 --> 00:29:30.579]  But also, it's also proven, too, that when they come out here and they're raiding these dispensaries, that they keep the money.
[00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:33.692]  And they keep the pot, and then they resell the pot.
[00:29:34.813 --> 00:29:34.973]  Yeah.
[00:29:50.231 --> 00:30:10.497]  I mean my point is that the cops are incredibly corrupt all over the country and we know they're making payoffs and what are they going to do though as 60, 70, 80, now in some polls 90% want drug decriminalization across the board but the drug dealers and the police and the government want to keep it illegal because they're making all the money.
[00:30:11.078 --> 00:30:15.719]  You know and they always try to like say well what's next, crystal meth, if we legalize this?
[00:30:16.249 --> 00:30:23.174]  When's the last time you're ever going to, you know, when are you ever going to see them having like a big Freedom March or a Freedom F March?
[00:30:23.214 --> 00:30:25.036]  People love marijuana.
[00:30:25.116 --> 00:30:26.297]  It's on a different level.
[00:30:26.877 --> 00:30:37.525]  And you know, and that just reminds me that we have like 420 day coming up and you know, not that I'm into any kind of numerology or anything like that, but as you know, April 20th is like the big day for marijuana smokers.
[00:30:38.266 --> 00:30:43.350]  And we're trying to get screenings going all over the country, including we're going to be at the Toronto Freedom Festival.
[00:30:43.883 --> 00:30:44.284]  Up there on 420.
[00:30:44.324 --> 00:30:49.630]  So I just wanted to shout out to everybody who wants to set up a 420 screening to get a hold of us.
[00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:50.251]  It'd be great.
[00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:51.352]  Absolutely.
[00:30:51.432 --> 00:31:00.343]  Now Kevin, separately though, and I want to go to some calls in a moment, dealing with marijuana
[00:31:01.684 --> 00:31:03.665]  The establishment is clearly losing the war.
[00:31:03.765 --> 00:31:10.948]  So what Obama has done is they're going to the states saying, fine, you can have some dispensaries, but you can't have a thousand dispensaries in your city.
[00:31:10.968 --> 00:31:12.229]  You can only have 75.
[00:31:12.589 --> 00:31:15.750]  And then select people get to have those dispensaries.
[00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.891]  So it's another monopoly being set up.
[00:31:18.351 --> 00:31:18.911]  No, exactly.
[00:31:18.931 --> 00:31:27.155]  I mean, and it's probably who all is going to, you know, I mean, I don't, I don't know for a fact, but you know, the people that are going to be left standing.
[00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:30.940]  You know, they're going to be the ones that are going to have to be buddying up to these people.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.961]  And then that will drive up the price of marijuana again and keep the illegal market going.
[00:31:36.241 --> 00:31:37.721]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:50.564]  I mean, all the street dealers, I know a handful of street dealers, especially the ones I've interviewed, they are happy, happy, happy, happy about all these dispensaries being shut down because they have lost all their business.
[00:31:51.411 --> 00:31:57.413]  You know, going to the corner to buy your marijuana from the crack dealer was the norm in the 80s and the 90s.
[00:31:57.693 --> 00:31:58.113]  No more.
[00:31:58.653 --> 00:32:07.216]  Why would you go to the corner to buy marijuana from some creepy guy when you know you can get the best of the best at some store with well-lit security guards out front?
[00:32:09.276 --> 00:32:14.038]  Well, the globalists want to keep everything in the shadows so they can control it and get the money out of it.
[00:32:14.238 --> 00:32:16.299]  Let's talk to anti-federalists from Georgia.
[00:32:16.319 --> 00:32:16.859]  You're on the air.
[00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:17.259]  Go ahead.
[00:32:18.427 --> 00:32:23.089]  Hey guys, I wanted to make a comment first about the film, American Drug War.
[00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:27.670]  I wanted to say that it's one of the, if not the only film I've ever seen on the drug war.
[00:32:28.171 --> 00:32:38.314]  It wasn't apologetic, it didn't really go after the medical marijuana, but actually went after the real issues about the actual drug war and the government's involvement.
[00:32:38.554 --> 00:32:45.197]  But my question is, you had mentioned before when you were on the show about some of the dispensaries being, having
[00:32:46.078 --> 00:32:49.719]  Oh yeah, the big cigarette makers have gone into California and are buying up all the key growing area.
[00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:52.500]  They're clearly getting ready to have it where the cigarette makers have it.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.981]  They can manipulate the genetics.
[00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:57.002]  They can add chemicals to it.
[00:33:16.104 --> 00:33:35.748]  Well, there's a lot of word out amongst the growers that I know that there's probably only going to be a small gap of time for all these people that have spent their whole lives creating all these drains and all that, from the time that it's legalized to the time that major corporations take it all over.
[00:33:36.408 --> 00:33:43.189]  There's probably going to be about a one-year slot in there for all these people to basically cash in on the last 20 years of their work.
[00:33:44.504 --> 00:33:48.265]  Um, and that's sad, but that's what everybody thinks is really going to happen.
[00:33:48.285 --> 00:33:52.427]  You know, giant corporations will swoop down and take over this whole thing.
[00:33:52.787 --> 00:33:54.488]  And so it's still really going to be illegal.
[00:33:54.588 --> 00:33:59.309]  Select corporations will be able to do it, and they're still going to put your kids in jail if they catch them with it.
[00:33:59.569 --> 00:34:04.351]  We've got to have real decriminalization, not the corporatization of this.
[00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:06.292]  A lot to do with strains, too.
[00:34:06.312 --> 00:34:12.934]  There's a lot of word out saying that, you know, the government will now have certain strains that you're allowed to have, and if you're caught using
[00:34:13.482 --> 00:34:22.586]  You know, it'll be the kind of thing where, you know, they'll confiscate your marijuana and test it, and if it's not the right kind of marijuana, you can get in trouble.
[00:34:22.966 --> 00:34:24.867]  If it's not the government-approved strain.
[00:34:24.947 --> 00:34:31.910]  Like, the government will own the patents on, like, you know, a certain amount of... And you know Monsanto's gonna come out with a Prozac strain or something.
[00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.970]  I mean... Of course.
[00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.811]  I'm sure they're working on it right now.
[00:34:34.871 --> 00:34:37.192]  There's no telling what all... You know, they're gonna...
[00:34:37.831 --> 00:34:38.911]  Exactly.
[00:34:39.031 --> 00:34:43.633]  It'll have the same exact effect, but they'll get all the pot smokers to take Prozac anyways, right?
[00:34:44.293 --> 00:34:45.893]  Let's talk to Ruth in Louisiana.
[00:34:45.913 --> 00:34:46.793]  You're on the air, Ruth.
[00:34:48.434 --> 00:34:48.994]  Yes.
[00:34:49.214 --> 00:34:50.174]  Hello, Alex.
[00:34:50.294 --> 00:34:52.475]  I've been praying for you every day.
[00:34:52.495 --> 00:34:53.215]  Thank you.
[00:34:55.316 --> 00:34:58.397]  I will tell... Well, I have two comments.
[00:34:58.617 --> 00:34:59.397]  One's personal.
[00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:06.079]  But the first one is, if it wasn't for marijuana in 2000,
[00:35:07.566 --> 00:35:08.447]  I would be dead.
[00:35:09.288 --> 00:35:09.588]  Really?
[00:35:09.868 --> 00:35:16.254]  I got a condition called cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is migraine in the stomach.
[00:35:17.055 --> 00:35:26.843]  I already had migraines all my life, but I went down to 85 pounds, couldn't eat, couldn't do anything.
[00:35:26.863 --> 00:35:32.869]  I just finally told my husband, you gotta go find me some, which he did.
[00:35:33.814 --> 00:35:36.676]  I did it late at night because the children were small at the time.
[00:35:36.756 --> 00:35:39.278]  I didn't want them to know what I was up to.
[00:35:40.479 --> 00:35:41.440]  And it saved my life.
[00:35:43.942 --> 00:35:59.414]  I was able to eat, keep my food down, got my weight back, but now I have to take morphine for the rest of my life and unfortunately I have to be tested every month.
[00:36:00.735 --> 00:36:01.936]  Let me expand on that.
[00:36:03.865 --> 00:36:04.465]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:36:04.846 --> 00:36:06.187]  I said move to California.
[00:36:06.207 --> 00:36:07.148]  Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:07.668]  It's real sad.
[00:36:07.688 --> 00:36:13.753]  I just went back to Texas not too long ago, and I have some extremely sick family members and relatives there.
[00:36:13.793 --> 00:36:16.976]  It just breaks my heart where I'm just like, oh my God, you guys.
[00:36:17.676 --> 00:36:27.484]  You know, first of all, yeah, smoking is not good for you, but for certain things like nausea, you've ever woken up in the middle of the night with like heartburn or really horrible stomachache?
[00:36:27.504 --> 00:36:29.886]  Taking a pill or putting anything like that, smoking,
[00:36:30.729 --> 00:36:37.275]  It is a really good way, or vaporizing, is a really good way of taking a drug for nausea.
[00:36:37.375 --> 00:36:39.337]  It bypasses... Well, Ruth, I appreciate your call.
[00:36:39.357 --> 00:36:40.097]  Let me just say this.
[00:36:41.759 --> 00:36:53.368]  Dealing with the nausea, that is the medically approved, the feds even admit, that marijuana is amazing for people that have chemo, that can't hold food down, and I don't have a lot of migraines.
[00:36:53.489 --> 00:36:54.609]  I think they're triggered by
[00:36:55.885 --> 00:37:22.877]  Pollen, because the only times I have them was when five, six years ago, four years ago or so, I started having them a couple times a year because I would go on these long bike rides when the cedar was dropping two or three times a year, and I'm allergic to the cedar pollen, and I would breathe so much of it that one time I got totally dizzy, it was a migraine, pulled over, I was vomiting on the side of the road, you know where you can't, I mean just hellish, and
[00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:33.048]  So those are the type of migraines I have where you're just vomiting and vomiting and vomiting and it's a level of pain I've never experienced and that's a good idea.
[00:37:33.088 --> 00:37:33.529]  Maybe I should...
[00:37:34.298 --> 00:37:38.100]  But luckily it hardly ever happens because I don't ride bikes when the cedar's out anymore.
[00:37:38.681 --> 00:37:49.388]  Because I figured out every time I would do that in heavy cedar, I would just breathe so much of it, it would literally just make my brain have an autoimmune response to all that pollen in my sinus and felt like I was dying.
[00:37:50.308 --> 00:37:52.290]  But maybe that's the answer.
[00:37:52.310 --> 00:38:00.735]  They have vaporizers now where you can actually use these things in a movie theater and no one will even know they're using it.
[00:38:00.895 --> 00:38:02.036]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:38:02.925 --> 00:38:06.487]  Uh, some of the new little gadgets they have out to be able to use marijuana.
[00:38:06.507 --> 00:38:08.928]  Well, let me tell you, the worst pain I've ever felt is a migraine.
[00:38:08.948 --> 00:38:10.169]  You ever had a migraine headache, Kevin?
[00:38:10.249 --> 00:38:10.629]  Oh, yeah.
[00:38:10.729 --> 00:38:11.670]  Yeah, I get them all the time.
[00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.830]  Oh, really?
[00:38:13.911 --> 00:38:16.372]  Not all the time, but yeah, I know what a migraine is.
[00:38:16.592 --> 00:38:17.393]  Oh, my God.
[00:38:18.233 --> 00:38:18.593]  I'm sure.
[00:38:18.653 --> 00:38:20.914]  God, how could Alex Jones not get migraines?
[00:38:20.994 --> 00:38:23.396]  Unless you're just built out of steel or something like that.
[00:38:23.496 --> 00:38:24.336]  I can't.
[00:38:24.356 --> 00:38:26.057]  Listening to you gives me a migraine someday.
[00:38:26.097 --> 00:38:27.258]  I can't imagine all the stress.
[00:38:29.779 --> 00:38:31.140]  No, I mean that a good way.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.782]  Listening to Alex Jones will guarantee give you a migraine.
[00:38:34.882 --> 00:38:38.884]  No, no, you're out there fighting a fight so all of us lazy slobs can lay around.
[00:38:39.844 --> 00:38:48.268]  Yeah, but the first time I had a migraine I was about 25 and my girlfriend was over, now my wife.
[00:38:49.048 --> 00:38:50.829]  I was 26 and I thought I was dying.
[00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:56.432]  And I called my dad and I said, I'm dizzy, blurred vision, I'm throwing up, this is the worst pain of my life.
[00:38:56.712 --> 00:38:57.933]  He said, you got a migraine, son.
[00:38:59.264 --> 00:39:04.708]  And, uh, he was right, but, uh, my, whoo, people that have migraines every day, I don't know how they deal with it.
[00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:10.552]  Does the medical evidence show that it helps, that marijuana helps migraines?
[00:39:10.573 --> 00:39:11.193]  Because I've read that.
[00:39:11.793 --> 00:39:15.816]  For some people, uh, you know, um, yeah, definitely.
[00:39:16.097 --> 00:39:20.480]  It, it, there are different strains for different people, all different types of ways of doing it.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:26.204]  I think, uh, for some people, for headaches, actually ingesting it might work better than smoking it.
[00:39:26.244 --> 00:39:27.545]  I mean, it's just, it's just different.
[00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:28.586]  I mean, it's the kind of thing where,
[00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:31.843]  You have to kind of find out, like, what works for you.
[00:39:32.283 --> 00:39:40.469]  But the good thing is that you can just safely experiment without really risking anything to kind of find out, like, you know, do you want to be high?
[00:39:40.509 --> 00:39:41.209]  You don't want to be high.
[00:39:41.229 --> 00:39:42.050]  Do you want to be sleepy?
[00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:42.931]  Do you want to be awake?
[00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:50.376]  You know, just all the different things that you can kind of feel your way around to, like, finding what works for you in a very safe fashion.
[00:39:50.416 --> 00:39:55.960]  And that's, like, the main thing that doctors and all these people that don't want to see all these
[00:39:56.946 --> 00:40:03.254]  You know, they don't want cures, they just want the pharmaceutical companies to be able to just treat everybody's symptoms, you know?
[00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:07.960]  And they don't want to cure anything, and that's, you know, going back to that Codex Alimentarius you were talking about.
[00:40:09.462 --> 00:40:10.903]  We're going to take some more calls, folks.
[00:40:10.963 --> 00:40:14.306]  I want to encourage you to get the DVD, How Weed Won the West.
[00:40:14.387 --> 00:40:15.528]  It's even more hardcore.
[00:40:15.548 --> 00:40:20.232]  It exposes government drug dealing, how they want to come after vitamins and minerals, the state's rights violation.
[00:40:20.492 --> 00:40:28.580]  How Weed Won the West, available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.682]  Let's go to David in California.
[00:40:30.722 --> 00:40:31.442]  David, you're on the air.
[00:40:32.523 --> 00:40:33.404]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:40:34.225 --> 00:40:34.405]  Good.
[00:40:35.629 --> 00:40:39.452]  Hey, I just wanted to share a little bit of some of my family's struggles.
[00:40:40.393 --> 00:40:44.236]  One of my cousins, actually, from a little kid, was just this immense rage.
[00:40:44.937 --> 00:40:47.959]  And they went to the doctors, and the doctors gave them all sorts of drugs.
[00:40:47.999 --> 00:40:49.440]  He was on Ritalin, Prozac.
[00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:55.725]  I mean, there was probably half a dozen to a dozen of adult-strength drugs, given this five- and six-year-old.
[00:40:56.326 --> 00:41:02.371]  And it wasn't until they got a prescription for marijuana that he basically said the trash jam in his head just cleared away.
[00:41:03.012 --> 00:41:09.895]  I mean, and when he was on these drugs, he actually woke up in the middle of the night with a knife, telling his mom that, you know, he heard these voices, and they're telling him to kill her.
[00:41:10.115 --> 00:41:31.463]  Oh no, yeah, Prozac and all that makes you go crazy, and the Ritalin and the other speed drugs are very similar to the methamphetamine, but the cops are, oh, methamphetamine's very bad, but let's make your kids take methamphetamine pills, which on the insert says causes delusions and psychopathic behavior, and yeah, a lot of these kids are on Ritalin, Prozac, they stack five or six drugs,
[00:41:32.183 --> 00:41:39.869]  The average foster child, more than two-thirds of foster children are on psychotropics, and the average child who's on them is on seven.
[00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:43.631]  Go ahead.
[00:41:43.831 --> 00:41:48.615]  Yeah, he was about, like I said, from the time he was five to six, all because he was angry.
[00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:52.557]  And it wasn't until he got the weed, but then they started going public with it.
[00:41:52.577 --> 00:41:57.981]  They were on Montel Williams, they had a CBS $48 thing, and all of a sudden their dispensary got raided.
[00:41:58.422 --> 00:42:00.343]  And they were no longer able to get the marijuana.
[00:42:00.856 --> 00:42:03.217]  Oh yeah, and you know, and since our first
[00:42:27.948 --> 00:42:31.551]  And by the way, he followed the state law, it was a big nice store, open, but then they say it's illegal.
[00:42:32.191 --> 00:42:33.412]  They just, it's incredible.
[00:42:33.432 --> 00:42:34.293]  This is Obama.
[00:42:56.636 --> 00:42:59.182]  You know, he inhaled and he's gonna put you in prison.
[00:43:03.553 --> 00:43:05.238]  Healthy Hearts Club presents...

[00:44:01.602 --> 00:44:05.287]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:05.628 --> 00:44:08.652]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:08.893 --> 00:44:10.295]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:10.996 --> 00:44:13.657]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:13.677 --> 00:44:19.899]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:20.059 --> 00:44:25.101]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:25.241 --> 00:44:35.225]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:35.365 --> 00:44:37.466]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:37.706 --> 00:44:39.027]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:39.307 --> 00:44:41.568]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:41.748 --> 00:44:43.608]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:48.710]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:49.031 --> 00:44:53.813]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:44:59.975 --> 00:45:00.856]  Spring is here.
[00:45:01.096 --> 00:45:01.876]  Growing season.
[00:45:02.057 --> 00:45:04.038]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:45:04.258 --> 00:45:05.659]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:45:05.959 --> 00:45:06.640]  Think about it.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.802]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:45:11.043 --> 00:45:14.525]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:45:14.785 --> 00:45:16.406]  The country is running out of food.
[00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:19.248]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:45:19.508 --> 00:45:29.715]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you,
[00:45:29.735 --> 00:45:30.215]  We're good.
[00:46:05.535 --> 00:46:09.016]  Khalid won the West, persecuting people that appeared in the film.
[00:46:09.176 --> 00:46:11.617]  The First Amendment, I guess, is evil, too, and needs to be banned.
[00:46:12.337 --> 00:46:14.277]  That's coming up in the next hour with Webster Tarpley.
[00:46:14.297 --> 00:46:20.899]  The Pentagon openly targeting websites in the United States and around the world as the enemy.
[00:46:20.919 --> 00:46:23.639]  Kevin Booth is our guest.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.900]  Kevin can't come to South by Southwest.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.380]  He's got a movie screening coming up.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.101]  What, in Vermont?
[00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:31.321]  They got a big Bill Hicks film premiering.
[00:46:31.341 --> 00:46:32.162]  What do you know about that?
[00:46:32.202 --> 00:46:33.802]  I know you were invited, Kevin, but you can't come.
[00:46:34.284 --> 00:46:36.645]  Yeah, it's already played twice there at South by Southwest.
[00:46:36.725 --> 00:46:38.225]  It's a great new film.
[00:46:38.305 --> 00:46:39.166]  Everybody should check it out.
[00:46:39.186 --> 00:46:41.347]  It's called American, the Bill Hicks story.
[00:46:41.407 --> 00:46:49.490]  These guys from England, Matt Harlock, Paul Thomas have been working on this thing for years and years.
[00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.010]  They put everything they have into it.
[00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:55.052]  Please go to the Paramount Theater this Saturday night, 9 o'clock.
[00:46:55.192 --> 00:46:55.632]  Check it out.
[00:46:55.652 --> 00:46:58.293]  It'll be the only time to see it in Texas for quite a while.
[00:46:59.389 --> 00:47:02.310]  An incredible movie, the way they did all this animation and everything like that.
[00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:04.471]  But Kevin, they should have just interviewed me!
[00:47:04.671 --> 00:47:06.432]  After all, I am Bill Hicks!
[00:47:06.792 --> 00:47:07.493]  That's true too.
[00:47:07.573 --> 00:47:08.873]  Well, maybe you can be part two.
[00:47:10.374 --> 00:47:14.095]  Have you seen the thousands of webpages that say I'm Bill Hicks?
[00:47:14.656 --> 00:47:15.476]  I get it every day.
[00:47:15.496 --> 00:47:17.277]  I get it every day.
[00:47:17.297 --> 00:47:21.218]  I mean, that is a ridiculous conspiracy theory.
[00:47:22.779 --> 00:47:24.660]  I'm some sort of a Svengali, remember?
[00:47:25.899 --> 00:47:29.760]  Well, yeah, because you were friends with Bill Hicks, and then we were friends.
[00:47:30.441 --> 00:47:32.981]  I mean, this is absolutely asinine.
[00:47:33.222 --> 00:47:36.203]  It's like that Steve Martin movie, The Man with Two Brains, or something like that.
[00:47:38.483 --> 00:47:39.904]  But it's not funny to the family.
[00:47:40.304 --> 00:47:41.264]  We shouldn't laugh, folks.
[00:47:41.284 --> 00:47:42.165]  That's very hurtful.
[00:47:43.525 --> 00:47:45.946]  Because it's gotten pretty big on the web, Kevin.
[00:47:46.246 --> 00:47:47.666]  Yeah, I know, it's crazy.
[00:47:48.187 --> 00:47:51.228]  I mean, I have to just laugh about crazy stuff like that, but it's not real.
[00:47:51.448 --> 00:47:52.868]  It's not cool.
[00:47:53.268 --> 00:47:54.749]  Kevin, you're involved in the cover-up now.
[00:47:56.556 --> 00:48:06.062]  Hey, real quick though, once again, because I'm not sure if anybody knows about this, but I'll be in Vermont at the Linden State College Thursday night, showing how we'd won the West.
[00:48:06.142 --> 00:48:10.545]  If anybody lives in Vermont, please come.
[00:48:10.565 --> 00:48:12.286]  And I, Bill Hicks, will be here in Austin.
[00:48:12.686 --> 00:48:13.187]  That's right.
[00:48:13.527 --> 00:48:14.968]  You should go to the screening Saturday.
[00:48:15.568 --> 00:48:15.788]  Ha!
[00:48:15.988 --> 00:48:16.228]  Yeah.
[00:48:17.089 --> 00:48:18.050]  Oh man, I tell ya.
[00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:24.874]  People love baloney conspiracy theories, but real stuff, a lot of folks seem to want to ignore it, Kevin.
[00:48:26.127 --> 00:48:29.452]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, it just depends on the people.
[00:48:29.953 --> 00:48:34.039]  You know, I mean, uh, I guess people try to have fun with conspiracy, too.
[00:48:34.259 --> 00:48:36.663]  You know, and that's what gives conspiracy a bad name, right?
[00:48:37.691 --> 00:48:40.432]  Well, yeah, because I'm not really a conspiracy theorist.
[00:48:40.452 --> 00:48:42.774]  I mean, we told people the Pentagon was coming after websites.
[00:48:43.174 --> 00:48:45.215]  It's now mainstream news, BBC.
[00:48:45.895 --> 00:48:46.696]  And that's real.
[00:48:46.956 --> 00:48:48.456]  The banks robbing us are real.
[00:48:50.417 --> 00:48:52.939]  And people want to talk about chupacabras and I'm Bill Hicks.
[00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:55.880]  I mean, you know, that's their issue.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.742]  But our denial of this, Kevin, is just more proof.
[00:48:58.762 --> 00:48:59.302]  You understand?
[00:48:59.682 --> 00:48:59.942]  Yeah.
[00:49:00.482 --> 00:49:01.563]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:49:04.064 --> 00:49:04.444]  Okay.
[00:49:04.665 --> 00:49:05.205]  Well, listen.
[00:49:05.585 --> 00:49:06.085]  Oh, the pelican.
[00:49:06.265 --> 00:49:07.206]  Look at the pelican fly.
[00:49:09.278 --> 00:49:11.499]  That's a little inside joke when we watch Scarface.
[00:49:13.279 --> 00:49:14.960]  Maybe I'm really Al Pacino, too.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.340]  That's it.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:17.680]  Alex is a gangster.
[00:49:19.861 --> 00:49:20.801]  Who put this together?
[00:49:20.901 --> 00:49:21.181]  Me!
[00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:22.022]  Who do I trust?
[00:49:22.162 --> 00:49:22.442]  Me!
[00:49:23.862 --> 00:49:24.382]  That's who.
[00:49:25.443 --> 00:49:28.363]  Yeah, I get some space cadet do it 50 bucks.
[00:49:28.824 --> 00:49:30.024]  And why don't you?
[00:49:34.325 --> 00:49:34.825]  Oh, man.
[00:49:36.446 --> 00:49:37.146]  That's a good movie.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.162]  I've only seen it 5,000 times.
[00:49:40.222 --> 00:49:42.685]  I watched it every day while I was editing American Drug War.
[00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:50.015]  When you used to live in Austin the last few years, before you moved to L.A., why you'd want to move to that place?
[00:49:50.215 --> 00:49:53.159]  The mudslides, the fires, the everything.
[00:49:53.179 --> 00:49:54.501]  When are you coming back to Texas, Kevin?
[00:49:55.613 --> 00:49:56.755]  Uh, hopefully over the summer.
[00:49:56.775 --> 00:49:59.057]  I always wanted to come back for South by Southwest.
[00:49:59.458 --> 00:50:01.400]  No, when are you coming back to live here?
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.000]  To live?
[00:50:02.641 --> 00:50:03.883]  Get out of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:50:04.103 --> 00:50:07.787]  As soon as my neighborhood explodes, I'm gonna, like, I have, like, a cannon.
[00:50:07.807 --> 00:50:10.170]  I have, like, a rocket, like, built around my house.
[00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:12.132]  I'm gonna catapult myself back to Austin.
[00:50:13.228 --> 00:50:13.829]  All right, buddy.
[00:50:14.229 --> 00:50:15.290]  How Weed Won the West.

[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.302]  Now they want to come after the vitamins and the government drug dealing.
[00:50:28.342 --> 00:50:28.902]  It's all covered.

[00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.530]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:38.351]  I'll talk to you soon.

[00:50:53.527 --> 00:50:56.228]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:50:56.268 --> 00:51:00.610]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[00:52:12.727 --> 00:52:14.848]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:14.908 --> 00:52:16.209]  Hour number four.
[00:52:16.249 --> 00:52:19.770]  Your phone calls coming up on a host of issues.
[00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:26.912]  I want to get into how going green may make you mean.
[00:52:27.112 --> 00:52:32.214]  Ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to steal.
[00:52:32.734 --> 00:52:34.195]  Major study finds.
[00:52:35.935 --> 00:52:40.297]  And that dovetails with this piece of a London Guardian.
[00:52:43.064 --> 00:52:45.986]  Oh yes, they found that they are many times more likely to steal.
[00:52:47.487 --> 00:52:48.008]  You name it.
[00:52:50.129 --> 00:52:58.995]  I also want to get into an important report about public schools around the world, where they're reporting that they're basically like prisons now.
[00:53:00.056 --> 00:53:01.577]  And that is the entire point.
[00:53:01.817 --> 00:53:02.698]  That's what's going on here.
[00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:10.724]  Also, we've got Webster Griffin Tarpley coming up here in just a moment.
[00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:15.710]  He's written a story we've got up on InfoWars.com.
[00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.831]  In fact, will you guys go ahead and pull that up for me?
[00:53:20.291 --> 00:53:22.211]  It's one of the InfoWars.com headlines.
[00:53:22.251 --> 00:53:23.051]  I forgot to print it.
[00:53:23.972 --> 00:53:25.932]  Where he talks about false flag, likely.
[00:53:26.612 --> 00:53:30.553]  Because I want to go over that report and for some reason... Oh no, I found it!
[00:53:31.353 --> 00:53:31.473]  U.S.
[00:53:31.533 --> 00:53:35.334]  Ready Cyberwar Virtual Flag Terrorism.
[00:53:36.995 --> 00:53:38.335]  And that ties in...
[00:53:40.011 --> 00:53:47.616]  With this Infowars.com report, we first picked it up on WikiLeaks, then it was picked up by The Register and the BBC.
[00:53:49.257 --> 00:53:54.080]  And, in fact, here is the BBC headline, U.S.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:57.442]  Plans to Fight the Net Revealed.
[00:53:58.323 --> 00:54:04.787]  And they talk about how the Internet is an enemy weapons system, and that their big enemy is WikiLeaks.
[00:54:05.827 --> 00:54:09.390]  Because WikiLeaks got a secret document a few months ago where the Army
[00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:14.191]  Was illegally spying on Americans in non-terror related cases.
[00:54:15.491 --> 00:54:21.414]  They got another document where an Army Intelligence Chief was using spies for his own private operations.
[00:54:23.215 --> 00:54:24.475]  In fact, I forgot to print that.
[00:54:25.075 --> 00:54:27.216]  I ended it this morning, but I didn't see it in my stack, guys.
[00:54:28.017 --> 00:54:29.557]  It was out in mainstream news yesterday.
[00:54:29.998 --> 00:54:35.200]  Army Intel Chief used operatives for his own private business, I think is the headline.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.501]  I want to get that story as well.
[00:54:38.972 --> 00:54:41.313]  To cover that coming up.
[00:54:41.873 --> 00:54:46.815]  And we're also going to talk to Tarbly about US-UK move closer to losing rating.
[00:54:47.455 --> 00:55:01.460]  Moody's says, open discussion of dollar default or devaluation or our credit line, our bonds being rated more like Mexico or Argentina or something.
[00:55:02.739 --> 00:55:07.244]  We'll also talk to Tarpley about the exciting news from Iceland, saying no to the banker takeover.
[00:55:07.284 --> 00:55:08.305]  What's happening in Greece?
[00:55:09.146 --> 00:55:11.909]  What nations Tarpley believes are the next dominoes to fall?
[00:55:12.269 --> 00:55:14.812]  How successful will the international banking cartel be?
[00:55:15.453 --> 00:55:18.096]  The communist Chinese are saying they may dump the dollar now.
[00:55:20.481 --> 00:55:22.302]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:55:22.342 --> 00:55:24.884]  In fact, that was a London Telegraph article I sent you.
[00:55:24.904 --> 00:55:26.065]  And again, I didn't see that in the stack.
[00:55:26.085 --> 00:55:26.725]  Maybe it's here.
[00:55:27.626 --> 00:55:30.428]  It was the London Telegraph story.
[00:55:30.448 --> 00:55:31.589]  I meant to get it earlier.
[00:55:31.669 --> 00:55:33.630]  Now it's time for Tarpley and I need to have it in front of me.
[00:55:35.191 --> 00:55:43.477]  Talking about the hubris of China and their statements and how all this incredible stuff is about to happen.
[00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:59.827]  And how China is threatening the United States and they likened it to what Tarpley compared it to a few months ago here, how England saw Germany as this rising power in World War I, started World War I with them.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:10.584]  And they similarly, by taking the British position, say China is bad like Germany before World War I and the United States is going to be getting in their face.
[00:56:11.405 --> 00:56:18.608]  So that is coming up as well here today with Webster Griffin Tarbley in this final hour when we come back.
[00:56:19.368 --> 00:56:25.833]  After this quick break, a host of issues to be discussed here with our guest.
[00:56:26.053 --> 00:56:27.894]  And I know we had a bunch of callers on the last subject.
[00:56:27.914 --> 00:56:30.416]  I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys go now who are on topic.
[00:56:30.436 --> 00:56:31.437]  I'm sorry we didn't get to some of you.
[00:56:32.628 --> 00:56:46.477]  I want to now clear the phone lines for anybody that wants to talk specifically to Tarpley about dollar default, about false flag terror, fake cyber false flag terror as a pretext to pass the Cybersecurity Act, what's happening with China.
[00:56:46.957 --> 00:56:51.820]  It is all coming up today in the last 52 minutes with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:56:52.141 --> 00:56:52.801]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:52.841 --> 00:56:56.403]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:56.484 --> 00:56:56.964]  Stay with us.
[00:56:58.177 --> 00:57:02.401]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:02.722 --> 00:57:03.342]  Number one.
[00:57:03.643 --> 00:57:06.805]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:07.066 --> 00:57:07.646]  Number two.
[00:57:07.926 --> 00:57:12.491]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:12.811 --> 00:57:13.271]  It's true.
[00:57:13.572 --> 00:57:18.116]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:18.416 --> 00:57:18.957]  Number 3.
[00:57:19.237 --> 00:57:22.540]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:26.585]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:26.745 --> 00:57:27.005]  Number 4.
[00:57:27.546 --> 00:57:29.928]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:30.308 --> 00:57:33.712]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:33.992 --> 00:57:34.193]  Number 5.
[00:57:34.773 --> 00:57:38.694]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:38.914 --> 00:57:43.675]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:57:43.955 --> 00:57:47.996]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:48.136 --> 00:57:49.696]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:57:58.345 --> 00:57:59.345]  What's your home worth?
[00:57:59.505 --> 00:58:01.426]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:58:01.626 --> 00:58:04.367]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:58:04.667 --> 00:58:12.169]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:58:12.369 --> 00:58:15.810]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:58:29.783 --> 00:58:30.924]  View comparable homes.
[00:58:31.284 --> 00:58:31.604]  We're good.
[00:59:00.202 --> 00:59:02.923]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[00:59:23.876 --> 00:59:25.838]  That's Buy 3, Get 1 Free.
[00:59:26.038 --> 00:59:28.741]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:35.508]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this Buy 3, Get 1 Free program.

[01:00:00.009 --> 01:00:05.015]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:07.698]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:34.972 --> 01:00:38.374]  The guys are in there joking and laughing so much I can barely focus on the show.
[01:00:38.774 --> 01:00:39.694]  Stop it, guys.
[01:00:41.935 --> 01:00:43.856]  Stuff behind the scenes here is so crazy.
[01:00:43.876 --> 01:00:47.338]  Alright, let me get my serious mindset on here.
[01:00:47.358 --> 01:00:51.179]  Here's what we're going to cover in the next 51 minutes with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:52.900]  The banking.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:56.902]  US-UK move closer to losing rating, Moody says.
[01:00:57.903 --> 01:01:00.684]  Dr. Tarpley is an economist, also a doctorate of history.
[01:01:01.926 --> 01:01:03.887]  I always enjoy his perspectives.
[01:01:04.868 --> 01:01:05.989]  Also, we're going to get into U.S.
[01:01:06.469 --> 01:01:08.891]  plans to fight the net revealed.
[01:01:10.114 --> 01:01:22.461]  Now they've admitted this the last two years, that cyber security is taking over, the Pentagon is taking over the infrastructure, they're going to restrict, they're going to hire provocateurs, Cass Sunstein, tax conspiracy theories, i.e.
[01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:32.607]  questioning government, anthropogenic global warming, everything is to be illegal, just incredible things happening, open talk of more war with Iran,
[01:01:33.507 --> 01:01:34.887]  News reports of more U.S.
[01:01:34.947 --> 01:01:38.589]  forces moving into Diego Garcia and other areas.
[01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:49.692]  And then separately, this article is China's Politburo spoiling for a showdown with America.
[01:01:50.092 --> 01:01:52.153]  This is the London Telegraph today.
[01:01:52.193 --> 01:01:55.274]  In fact, can I have a document cam shot of this, boys, for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers?
[01:01:56.431 --> 01:02:02.113]  The long-simmering clash between the world's two great powers is coming to a head with dangerous implications.
[01:02:02.133 --> 01:02:04.354]  I want to cover this first with Tarpley before the internet stuff.
[01:02:04.374 --> 01:02:05.754]  Because it all ties together.
[01:02:06.234 --> 01:02:08.895]  Because all these governments are getting themselves ready for war.
[01:02:09.295 --> 01:02:10.195]  Economic, you name it.
[01:02:10.816 --> 01:02:14.257]  Is China's Politburo spoiling for a showdown with America?
[01:02:15.117 --> 01:02:18.558]  Of course, Tarpley will say, no, it's the West trying to encircle China.
[01:02:18.978 --> 01:02:21.299]  They're all a bunch of thugs, government scum run.
[01:02:21.319 --> 01:02:24.220]  But the point is, there's no doubt that
[01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.116]  This is happening.
[01:02:26.616 --> 01:02:33.621]  The long-simmering clash between the world's two great powers is coming to a head, with dangerous implications for the international system.
[01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:35.863]  Now, the last six months this has been simmering.
[01:02:35.903 --> 01:02:45.410]  We've been talking about it with our expert guests, all agreeing that there's major battle lines, that the Iran situation in Pakistan is just set pieces into China.
[01:02:46.391 --> 01:02:47.552]  Now listen to this article.
[01:02:48.312 --> 01:02:50.314]  China has succumbed to hubris.
[01:02:52.449 --> 01:02:58.892]  It has mistaken the soft diplomacy of Barack Obama for weakness, mistaken the U.S.
[01:02:58.932 --> 01:03:07.536]  credit crisis for decline, and mistaken its own mercantilist bubble for ascendancy.
[01:03:07.736 --> 01:03:10.478]  Aw, they admit it's mercantilism how we've been de-industrialized.
[01:03:10.798 --> 01:03:12.959]  It was our big banking cartels that set the deal up.
[01:03:13.439 --> 01:03:14.960]  Mercantilism, by design!
[01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:19.219]  Not free trade, to ruin all their competition.
[01:03:19.519 --> 01:03:23.162]  I've never seen such an honest article by Ambrose Evans Pritchard, but it's not honest.
[01:03:23.202 --> 01:03:27.465]  It's twisted to say that it's all China, but the information is somewhat accurate.
[01:03:28.766 --> 01:03:32.229]  It has mistaken the soft diplomacy of Barack Obama for weakness, mistaken the U.S.
[01:03:32.249 --> 01:03:37.413]  credit crisis for decline, and mistaken its own mercantilist bubble for ascendancy.
[01:03:37.854 --> 01:03:41.757]  There are echoes of the Anglo-German spats before the First World War, when
[01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:47.842]  Wilhelm Berlin so badly misjudged the strategic balance of power and overplayed its hand.
[01:03:48.803 --> 01:03:57.471]  It's going to be really hard for them, yet again, to fudge on the obvious fact that China is manipulating without a credible threat.
[01:03:57.731 --> 01:04:03.437]  We're not going to get anywhere, said Paul Krugman, this year's Nobel Economist.
[01:04:04.514 --> 01:04:05.415]  And then it continues.
[01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:10.721]  China's Premier Wen Jiabao, I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong, is defiant.
[01:04:11.242 --> 01:04:12.964]  I don't think the yuan is undervalued.
[01:04:12.984 --> 01:04:19.211]  We oppose countries pointing fingers at each other and even forcing a country to appreciate its currency, he said yesterday.
[01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:20.832]  Once again, he demanded the U.S.
[01:04:20.872 --> 01:04:23.415]  takes concrete steps to reverse
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.722]  And reassure investors over the safety of U.S.
[01:04:26.842 --> 01:04:27.222]  assets.
[01:04:27.823 --> 01:04:30.125]  And then it goes on with them saying we're a police state.
[01:04:30.165 --> 01:04:32.026]  How dare you say we're a police state in China?
[01:04:32.527 --> 01:04:35.109]  And we've got Venezuela calling for Internet controls.
[01:04:35.169 --> 01:04:35.869]  That's wrong.
[01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:38.331]  But our government's actually putting it in place.
[01:04:38.892 --> 01:04:40.053]  And the article goes on and on.
[01:04:40.093 --> 01:04:41.214]  It's a very chilling story.
[01:04:41.434 --> 01:04:44.116]  But it's not just China saying the banks are looting us.
[01:04:44.576 --> 01:04:46.478]  It's Bloomberg and Moody saying
[01:04:46.858 --> 01:04:50.460]  We basically have already really lost our AAA rating, but it's still officially there.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:05:03.146]  So to talk about the geopolitical state of the world, what we're steaming into, echoes of World War I, World War II, all the pieces lining up, the domestic police state clamping down ahead of the war.
[01:05:04.407 --> 01:05:05.647]  What type of war is this?
[01:05:05.747 --> 01:05:07.168]  Economic, military, a mix?
[01:05:07.688 --> 01:05:10.690]  Webster, I mean this is an amazing story from the London Telegraph.
[01:05:11.499 --> 01:05:17.321]  Well, Ambrose Evans Pritchard, of course, is the voice of MI6 and British intelligence.
[01:05:18.061 --> 01:05:24.964]  And that newspaper, that rag over there, the London Daily Telegraph, were, of course, pro-Hitler all through the 1930s.
[01:05:25.224 --> 01:05:28.285]  They stuck with Hitler as long as they dared.
[01:05:28.906 --> 01:05:36.709]  So, it's good that you remembered this, or recalled this question about the British rivalry with Germany before 1914.
[01:05:38.382 --> 01:05:52.688]  When the British saw a rising industrial challenger, and of course their response to it was to attempt to play Russia and France against Germany, and the result of that is World War I, and the British found themselves dragged into it.
[01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:59.211]  Now, the current situation of Britain is that they are bankrupt six ways to Sunday.
[01:05:59.271 --> 01:06:01.372]  They are more bankrupt than Greece.
[01:06:02.312 --> 01:06:06.474]  One of the reasons for attacking Greece is to relieve pressure not just on the dollar,
[01:06:07.014 --> 01:06:10.935]  But also on the British pound and the city of London in general.
[01:06:11.155 --> 01:06:12.596]  And the metrics all show that.
[01:06:12.656 --> 01:06:16.838]  They are much more debt per capita per citizen and the government than Greece.
[01:06:17.078 --> 01:06:21.619]  And the rate of growth of British debt is also quicker.
[01:06:21.679 --> 01:06:24.680]  So we're dealing now with the British establishment.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:32.063]  So their response to this kind of a crisis is to attempt to create tensions between Russia and the United States.
[01:06:32.603 --> 01:06:39.228]  But also, as you see, to attempt to get in between the United States and China, and attempt to make that into a crisis.
[01:06:39.288 --> 01:06:45.412]  Because the British right now are so desperate, and I'm referring now to the ruling elite, because there are other forces that I'd like to refer to.
[01:06:46.129 --> 01:06:53.096]  But they're so desperate that they feel the only way they can hang on is by the simultaneous ruin of all the other contenders.
[01:06:53.156 --> 01:06:55.318]  And everybody needs to know this, right?
[01:06:55.338 --> 01:07:02.164]  The instinct of the British Foreign Office is divide and conquer, provoke conflict, get everybody else at each other's throats.
[01:07:02.665 --> 01:07:02.845]  Right?
[01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:03.645]  The BBC.
[01:07:03.766 --> 01:07:05.347]  Bed, breakfast, and conflict.
[01:07:05.487 --> 01:07:07.089]  They deal in conflict.
[01:07:07.129 --> 01:07:08.090]  And here they're trying to do it.
[01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:15.458]  The idea that there's a group in the Chinese Politburo that wants conflict is absolutely fantastic.
[01:07:15.919 --> 01:07:18.722]  These people are meek bureaucrats.
[01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:23.238]  Uh, relatively speaking, who are attempting to avoid conflict.
[01:07:23.318 --> 01:07:39.770]  And right now, that group of bureaucrats in the Politburo is paying the price for their bad decisions of the last 20 years, essentially opening up to free trade to a significant degree, although they've tried to use other people's free trade rather than their own.
[01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:42.612]  Let's say their big crime is to pay lip service.
[01:07:43.129 --> 01:07:48.933]  That's what they're doing, but let me stop you before we digress off into economics and what you think China should do.
[01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:13.931]  What is the larger, from your perspective, program?
[01:08:13.991 --> 01:08:26.756]  Why did the West invest almost everything in China, build them up, and then now double back and attack China for all the power they've got, when the CFR and others have said this century is the Chinese century?
[01:08:26.776 --> 01:08:27.196]  I mean, is that...
[01:08:27.836 --> 01:08:43.256]  I mean we know the British great game is to play powers off against each other and we know that they control a lot of our policy here and that we're joined at the hip of the Anglo-American Dutch system but I mean pulling away before we go off into light pebble reactors and monorail and I mean that's all
[01:08:43.556 --> 01:08:45.857]  Right, which is where they should go and where we should too.
[01:08:45.877 --> 01:08:47.759]  That's where they're going, and we're not.
[01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:50.120]  But the point here is, the larger picture.
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:57.184]  What was the method in the madness of moving the industrial base to China and now running around like chickens with their heads cut off about it?
[01:08:57.424 --> 01:09:02.988]  The problem with this is that the finance oligarchy of London and Wall Street cannot plan the world.
[01:09:03.408 --> 01:09:08.711]  They have no plan, and they think they have a plan, but their plan contains boomerangs.
[01:09:09.456 --> 01:09:11.320]  Uh, unintended consequences.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.226]  For example, the reason that they sent U.S.
[01:09:14.286 --> 01:09:17.152]  industry to China is simple greed.
[01:09:17.705 --> 01:09:18.086]  Of course.
[01:09:39.628 --> 01:09:42.270]  That the power of China is actually relative.
[01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:49.856]  It has to do with the industrial collapse of the United States, the relative de-industrialization of the European Union, and so forth.
[01:09:49.896 --> 01:09:54.360]  This makes the Chinese look like a big frog, you might say, in a small pond.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.662]  In reality, they have tremendous weaknesses.
[01:09:56.702 --> 01:09:59.384]  They've got about, you know, one half of the country.
[01:10:00.605 --> 01:10:09.390]  600 million, two-thirds of the country, perhaps, are essentially poverty-stricken peasants in the interior, feeling very, very resentful about what their government is doing.
[01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:26.660]  But nevertheless, now, the Anglo-Americans, these wonderful guys who live from hand to mouth and are constantly obsessed with short-term speculative gain, they now realize that they're confronting a serious problem with China, that after all the era of the neocons and now the Obama-bots,
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:32.562]  The Chinese are getting thoroughly riled up, especially by this latest arrogance with Google.
[01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:36.284]  Google is essentially an arm of the National Security Agency, right?
[01:10:36.304 --> 01:10:40.505]  When Google attacks you, it's the National Security Agency, it's the U.S.
[01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:41.626]  intelligence community.
[01:10:41.686 --> 01:10:42.206]  It is them.
[01:10:42.286 --> 01:10:44.807]  It's the rogue network running the show there.
[01:10:45.247 --> 01:10:49.529]  So, Google is saying to China, we refuse to obey your laws.
[01:10:49.589 --> 01:10:53.530]  Now, for the Chinese, this goes back to what are called the unequal treaties, right?
[01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.991]  Since the British Opium Wars,
[01:10:55.627 --> 01:11:03.631]  In 1840 to 1860, you had this stuff with treaty ports, in other words, foreigners had more rights in China than the Chinese did themselves.
[01:11:04.111 --> 01:11:07.013]  And the Chinese society went through a tremendous breakdown crisis.
[01:11:07.093 --> 01:11:19.118]  Now you get NSA, Google, acting in the way of a 19th century imperialist saying, we demand immunity from your laws, we demand extraterritorial treatment, how dare you attack us?
[01:11:19.158 --> 01:11:20.299]  And of course, the hypocrisy is
[01:11:20.419 --> 01:11:24.082]  Which is the same thing that the global corporations do in the West.
[01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:30.507]  They're all above the law, and we're being colonized and broken up into 10, 12 parts, just like China was.
[01:11:30.668 --> 01:11:32.069]  These are corporate fiefdoms.
[01:11:32.349 --> 01:11:39.435]  But the Chinese have the advantage of seeing this as a foreign attack, and there's a huge nationalist movement in China, which is a problem for the government.
[01:11:39.455 --> 01:11:44.819]  Now I know, anti-New World Order stuff's really hot there, the best-selling books are about the banking cartel, the New World Order.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:50.302]  So, are the communists turning against the people that put them in power?
[01:11:50.802 --> 01:11:51.803]  Are they even communists?
[01:11:51.823 --> 01:11:53.263]  We'll be right back with Webster Tarpley.
[01:11:53.524 --> 01:11:54.184]  We'll be right back.
[01:11:54.224 --> 01:11:55.825]  We know the banks are the ultimate communists.
[01:12:00.026 --> 01:12:02.207]  RFID chips are becoming more and more common.
[01:12:02.548 --> 01:12:07.750]  Right now, there are hundreds of millions of new credit cards and passports that contain these tiny radios.
[01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:10.431]  How can you keep them from transmitting your information?
[01:12:10.651 --> 01:12:12.512]  Turn them off with ID Stronghold.
[01:12:12.732 --> 01:12:14.653]  Secure wallets and secure sleeves
[01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:17.074]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:12:17.214 --> 01:12:21.654]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[01:12:21.695 --> 01:12:23.975]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman.
[01:12:37.898 --> 01:12:38.078]  Thank you.
[01:13:00.695 --> 01:13:04.363]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:04.723 --> 01:13:07.729]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:09.393]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:13:10.291 --> 01:13:12.753]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:12.773 --> 01:13:18.977]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:19.157 --> 01:13:24.161]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:24.341 --> 01:13:34.388]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:34.468 --> 01:13:36.589]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:36.809 --> 01:13:38.150]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:39.271]  And the Congress is saying,
[01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:40.651]  Who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:42.692]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:47.694]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:15:49.495 --> 01:15:54.118]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:16:02.446 --> 01:16:08.487]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:16:09.087 --> 01:16:12.068]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:12.588 --> 01:16:16.129]  Alright, we got phone calls coming up in the next segment with Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:17.269]  I'm Alex Jones, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:16:17.309 --> 01:16:23.690]  Ladies and gentlemen, here is the secret.
[01:16:24.851 --> 01:16:25.371]  Documents.
[01:16:26.971 --> 01:16:28.751]  You can go up to Infowars.com.
[01:16:28.811 --> 01:16:31.472]  We have links to this document.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:33.640]  U.S.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:42.588]  intelligence planned to destroy WikiLeaks and they were sent the secret NOFORN 32-page U.S.
[01:16:42.628 --> 01:16:48.894]  counterintelligence manual and this is from February 2008.
[01:16:50.919 --> 01:16:58.152]  And they describe the internet as an enemy weapons platform, as WikiLeaks, a terrorist group, insurgents.
[01:16:58.873 --> 01:17:04.062]  It says an online reference to foreign intelligence services insurgents or terror groups.
[01:17:06.107 --> 01:17:07.769]  And this is up on WikiLeaks.
[01:17:08.449 --> 01:17:10.391]  Now, what has WikiLeaks been releasing?
[01:17:10.491 --> 01:17:15.195]  Two weeks ago it came out in Utah that the Pentagon was watching U.S.
[01:17:15.255 --> 01:17:17.277]  citizens in non-terror-related cases.
[01:17:17.698 --> 01:17:18.118]  Illegal!
[01:17:19.119 --> 01:17:21.281]  WikiLeaks got documents, they confirmed they're real.
[01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:32.091]  WikiLeaks put out the White House memo, the Downing Street memo, that was released by MI6 where Bush was, you know, in there, we've got to fix the intelligence, we've got to lie about WMDs.
[01:17:33.583 --> 01:17:36.545]  It's come out that Dick Cheney wanted to blow up U.S.
[01:17:36.585 --> 01:17:38.226]  ships and blame it on Iran.
[01:17:38.886 --> 01:17:39.807]  They hate this site.
[01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:41.228]  There's a lot of others that are doing it as well.
[01:17:41.468 --> 01:17:48.572]  But I noticed in New Zealand, when they started banning sites until people screamed bloody murder, it was InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, WikiLeaks.
[01:17:49.072 --> 01:17:50.453]  We don't even post these documents.
[01:17:50.553 --> 01:17:52.274]  I'm not getting into those waters.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.962]  Well, we support those that do if it's exposing crime.
[01:17:58.582 --> 01:18:01.444]  And they're now saying that it's a weapons system.
[01:18:01.484 --> 01:18:02.225]  Here's the BBC.
[01:18:02.305 --> 01:18:02.545]  U.S.
[01:18:02.565 --> 01:18:04.126]  plans to fight the net revealed.
[01:18:04.426 --> 01:18:11.191]  And they're openly saying that they're building all these NSA centers to spy on everything the American people do without warrants.
[01:18:11.671 --> 01:18:14.493]  And we've got Cass Sunstein saying, get rid of the free internet.
[01:18:14.713 --> 01:18:17.835]  We have Wired Magazine headlines, cyber security ends open internet.
[01:18:18.295 --> 01:18:21.077]  Webster, I think people need to realize this is really happening.
[01:18:21.097 --> 01:18:23.259]  They're really preparing to censor the web.
[01:18:23.359 --> 01:18:23.599]  Why?
[01:18:26.618 --> 01:18:35.024]  ...desire of totalitarian figures like Cass Sunstein to impose what used to be called prior restraint.
[01:18:35.084 --> 01:18:39.327]  In other words, they would like to censor what you put up there before you can put it up.
[01:18:39.367 --> 01:18:45.531]  And of course, prior restraint is totally alien to the American tradition.
[01:18:45.571 --> 01:18:48.213]  But the other side of it, of course, is cyber warfare.
[01:18:48.253 --> 01:18:49.994]  And I think this is maybe worth pointing out.
[01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:54.997]  You covered, of course, the CNN two-hour special featuring all these 9-11
[01:18:56.825 --> 01:19:10.774]  Uh, heavyweights and plug uglies, uh, a couple of weeks ago, which was the simulation of this big attack on the United States coming from Russia, China, and Sudan that eventually shut down the entire electrical system.
[01:19:11.034 --> 01:19:26.083]  Uh, I think there's a, there's a group in the, in the Pentagon and the think tanks, and I'm looking especially at Yoda, Andrew Marshall at the Office of Net Assessment in the Pentagon, the guy who actually controls the Pentagon Defense Science Board from, from behind the scenes.
[01:19:26.505 --> 01:19:31.864]  And they're gearing up for cyber hysteria, cyber warfare, and I think they have four things in mind.
[01:19:32.253 --> 01:19:35.655]  The first is total exaggeration of what can be done, right?
[01:19:35.696 --> 01:19:43.781]  They say, oh, a telephone virus can shut down the telephone system, you can shut down the airports, you can shut down the trains, you can shut down the power systems.
[01:19:44.182 --> 01:19:47.004]  As far as I can see, this is baloney, malarkey.
[01:19:47.144 --> 01:19:48.205]  It has never been done.
[01:19:48.645 --> 01:19:54.629]  And the sources for the idea that it could be done are the CIA on one side and the Wall Street Journal on the other.
[01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:58.392]  So the worst of the rogue network and the worst of the Wall Street gang.
[01:19:58.792 --> 01:20:15.292]  So I think people have got to realize this idea that you can, you know, sabotage a nuclear reactor from afar with a virus through a computer is probably in the same league with Saddam's weapons of mass destruction or Tony Blair saying Iraq can strike London within 45 minutes.
[01:20:15.332 --> 01:20:17.595]  We remember all of this fantastic stuff.
[01:20:18.075 --> 01:20:28.402]  The other thing they try to do is to take the language of the Cold War and the language of nuclear confrontation and translate that into this new cyber jargon, right, of the computer age.
[01:20:28.442 --> 01:20:38.549]  Remember, deterrence, retaliation, first strike, second strike, counter value, counter force, all this stuff, they now translate that into computer talk.
[01:20:39.059 --> 01:20:40.621]  So that you can think about this, right?
[01:20:40.701 --> 01:20:46.929]  And they're attempting to educate the public in the idea that this is possible, which again, I think it's actually not.
[01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:51.074]  And again, why would regional power grids be hooked to the internet?
[01:20:51.875 --> 01:20:54.218]  Why would nuclear reactors be hooked to the internet?
[01:20:54.258 --> 01:20:56.481]  I mean, obviously it's made up, it's exaggerated.
[01:20:57.122 --> 01:20:59.644]  That's admitted for anyone that knows any basics of computers.
[01:20:59.684 --> 01:21:01.625]  My IT guys say this is a complete joke.
[01:21:01.925 --> 01:21:02.305]  Right.
[01:21:02.345 --> 01:21:11.871]  But why would they, and clearly they're gearing up to launch a false flag against themselves right as they're trying to pass the cyber security takeover in the Senate.
[01:21:12.732 --> 01:21:15.534]  I would actually call this virtual flag terrorism.
[01:21:15.574 --> 01:21:17.395]  This is the expression that I've tried to coin.
[01:21:17.795 --> 01:21:18.956]  Virtual flag terrorism.
[01:21:18.976 --> 01:21:20.497]  Because look at this wonderful advantage.
[01:21:21.272 --> 01:21:28.334]  Something happens, you can blame Russia and China, and how is anybody going to say, no, it's a lie, no, it's not true?
[01:21:28.374 --> 01:21:47.520]  They'll say, the NSA has determined that this crash in the DC subway was actually caused from Beijing, or Moscow, or... They can take a regular train derailment, or a regular power outage, and say that Americans did it, or communists did it, or the Keebler elves did it, or the brain bug did it.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.360]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:50.103 --> 01:21:53.085]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.026 --> 01:21:56.788]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.009 --> 01:22:00.751]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[01:22:01.031 --> 01:22:06.796]  Well here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:14.902]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[01:22:15.302 --> 01:22:21.424]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[01:22:21.664 --> 01:22:23.645]  That's buy three, get one free.
[01:22:23.825 --> 01:22:26.546]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[01:22:26.746 --> 01:22:34.288]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[01:22:34.708 --> 01:22:37.609]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[01:22:37.969 --> 01:22:38.829]  Another example?
[01:22:39.029 --> 01:22:42.090]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:47.371]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[01:22:47.391 --> 01:22:48.131]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[01:22:48.191 --> 01:22:49.251]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[01:23:00.899 --> 01:23:04.568]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:23:04.909 --> 01:23:07.936]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:08.177 --> 01:23:09.580]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:23:10.279 --> 01:23:12.940]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:19.162]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:19.342 --> 01:23:24.364]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:23:24.884 --> 01:23:34.508]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:23:34.628 --> 01:23:36.749]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:36.989 --> 01:23:38.309]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:38.569 --> 01:23:40.850]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:42.891]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:47.972]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:48.293 --> 01:23:53.094]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:23:53.314 --> 01:23:57.416]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:59.136 --> 01:23:59.777]  Hi, everyone.
[01:23:59.937 --> 01:24:00.798]  Andy Anderson here.
[01:24:00.998 --> 01:24:05.242]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[01:24:05.403 --> 01:24:11.069]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:15.453]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[01:24:15.553 --> 01:24:17.235]  No more protection till you use it again.
[01:24:17.395 --> 01:24:18.556]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[01:24:18.736 --> 01:24:23.079]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.

[01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:28.250]  Get it first.
[01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:32.192]  We'll go back to Webster here in just a moment and to some of your phone calls.
[01:25:32.493 --> 01:25:34.094]  First, I want to thank some of the sponsors.
[01:25:35.094 --> 01:25:35.754]  We're good to go.
[01:25:57.828 --> 01:25:59.129]  It grabs the water out of the air.
[01:25:59.429 --> 01:26:04.753]  The best, cleanest water you're going to find.
[01:26:05.013 --> 01:26:08.776]  Ecolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:09.176]  800-691-6043.
[01:26:09.216 --> 01:26:10.778]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:26:11.158 --> 01:26:12.098]  Check out the website.
[01:26:12.759 --> 01:26:14.981]  Also, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:26:15.121 --> 01:26:16.682]  One word, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:26:16.702 --> 01:26:18.983]  There's banners for all these sponsors up on InfoWars, by the way.
[01:26:19.784 --> 01:26:23.107]  Have you ever lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:26:23.167 --> 01:26:24.808]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com.
[01:26:24.828 --> 01:26:29.632]  There's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electricity.
[01:26:29.672 --> 01:26:32.474]  It's the solar power unit, the controller, the battery system.

[01:26:56.243 --> 01:26:59.346]  Webster, this is not just you saying this.
[01:26:59.406 --> 01:27:00.447]  It's Wall Street Journal.
[01:27:00.527 --> 01:27:01.608]  It's Wired Magazine.
[01:27:01.628 --> 01:27:02.529]  We've got the bill.
[01:27:02.929 --> 01:27:05.171]  We've got the White House saying they want to censor the Internet.
[01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:06.312]  Attack U.S.
[01:27:06.372 --> 01:27:06.953]  websites.
[01:27:07.393 --> 01:27:08.214]  Censor people.
[01:27:09.235 --> 01:27:21.566]  Force everybody onto a new Internet, too, where, according to the new rules, it's a private corporate system that the government pays for with tax money, and they say, oh, you can have the old Internet that doesn't work anymore, but if you're on the new Web, well,
[01:27:22.307 --> 01:27:23.268]  There's all these rules.
[01:27:23.288 --> 01:27:26.229]  You've got to have a sub-website on a larger domain.
[01:27:27.049 --> 01:27:31.932]  Continuing, clearly I've been saying I believe there's going to be a virtual flag attack.
[01:27:31.972 --> 01:27:34.013]  I've called it a fake false flag internet attack.
[01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:35.374]  Great term you've coined.
[01:27:35.934 --> 01:27:37.695]  A virtual flag attack.
[01:27:38.735 --> 01:27:39.776]  And it looks like they're really
[01:27:40.805 --> 01:27:55.074]  Again, going hard and heavy with the pre-conditioning that they're the good guys, it's gonna come, they've gotta take all your rights, everybody who has a website's gotta be certified, anybody in IT's gotta be certified.
[01:27:55.334 --> 01:28:01.798]  It talks about youth corps in high school and college recruiting them to just have hundreds of thousands working for the feds.
[01:28:02.158 --> 01:28:04.119]  I mean, this is declaring war on the internet.
[01:28:04.139 --> 01:28:05.280]  We've been saying that for years.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.641]  But here's the BBC.
[01:28:06.801 --> 01:28:07.121]  U.S.
[01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:09.562]  plans to fight the net revealed.
[01:28:09.622 --> 01:28:10.283]  Webster Tarpley.
[01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:11.764]  Bottom line, where's this going?
[01:28:12.505 --> 01:28:25.796]  Well, if you notice, the cast of characters, the cast of enemies and targets that come with this whole new thing, is very different in that CNN special, somebody at some point brings up the question, is this Bin Laden, is this Al Qaeda?
[01:28:26.317 --> 01:28:28.218]  And they practically laugh him out of the room.
[01:28:28.579 --> 01:28:29.420]  They respond with,
[01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:30.271]  Yes.
[01:28:47.208 --> 01:28:50.689]  And so we've got to take your web freedom to save you from shadowy Ruskies.
[01:29:07.529 --> 01:29:10.812]  Right, but they're also looking for conflict.
[01:29:10.872 --> 01:29:15.396]  In other words, it's an area of confrontation which they think they can do.
[01:29:15.456 --> 01:29:18.139]  In other words, with nuclear war, of course, it's unthinkable.
[01:29:18.479 --> 01:29:19.700]  You can get your head blown off.
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:25.085]  But I think the idea of spreading it, Booz Allen Hamilton and the National Security Agency,
[01:29:25.623 --> 01:29:32.909]  And in this Defense Science Board and the Office of Net Assessment of Yoda in the Pentagon, this is something you can do.
[01:29:32.969 --> 01:29:33.850]  It's not unthinkable.
[01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:35.051]  It's going on all the time.
[01:29:35.471 --> 01:29:37.273]  And you can blame anybody you want, right?
[01:29:37.353 --> 01:29:38.554]  Google blames China.
[01:29:38.814 --> 01:29:39.615]  Where's the proof?
[01:29:39.795 --> 01:29:40.676]  There is no proof.
[01:29:41.016 --> 01:29:41.917]  China denies it.
[01:29:42.197 --> 01:29:43.138]  So how do we know?
[01:29:43.498 --> 01:29:46.260]  So you can essentially attack yourself.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:51.885]  You can shut down your own nuclear reactor or airport and then say, oh, that was Moscow.
[01:29:52.245 --> 01:29:52.966]  That was Beijing.
[01:29:52.986 --> 01:29:56.749]  And again, Bush's cyber security bill two years ago that Obama's ramming through.
[01:29:57.069 --> 01:29:59.291]  Headline, should Obama control the net?
[01:29:59.331 --> 01:30:00.071]  Mother Jones.
[01:30:00.552 --> 01:30:10.360]  It's designed for them to shut the web off and they're saying we may have to shut the internet down to save you right at the time when the internet is fully unmasking the bankers.
[01:30:10.788 --> 01:30:24.436]  Right, and Obama personally kicked this off last May with a speech where he said, I haven't revealed this yet, but my own websites, my campaign websites, were attacked by hackers during the election campaign.
[01:30:24.796 --> 01:30:27.638]  And I had to go to the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA.
[01:30:27.718 --> 01:30:33.722]  So, in a certain sense, you can say the Obama websites, right, all of those famous websites that he has.
[01:30:34.182 --> 01:30:34.603]  We're good to go.
[01:30:54.079 --> 01:31:00.646]  I would say more broadly, the impetus towards police states and dictatorships comes from the economic realm.
[01:31:00.686 --> 01:31:09.176]  In other words, it's the economic breakdown crisis that allows governments to think that they can take people's rights away.
[01:31:09.196 --> 01:31:11.298]  Okay, Webster, that's my next issue.
[01:31:11.358 --> 01:31:14.481]  I want to get in with you before we...
[01:31:15.322 --> 01:31:15.743]  Leave.
[01:31:16.183 --> 01:31:18.565]  I want to have you cover that before the show's over here.
[01:31:19.126 --> 01:31:22.909]  But I want to go to some calls now, because I always forget and never go to them.
[01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:29.075]  So we're going to take five calls quickly, and then we're going to look at the economic realm.
[01:31:29.176 --> 01:31:31.097]  Everything you talked about now coming true.
[01:31:31.718 --> 01:31:34.040]  In spades, U.S., U.K.
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:36.463]  move closer to losing rating.
[01:31:36.863 --> 01:31:38.645]  Moody's says Bloomberg.
[01:31:39.085 --> 01:31:42.387]  Now, what does that mean for a lay person out there?
[01:31:42.467 --> 01:31:44.828]  What does the death of the dollar mean?
[01:31:45.209 --> 01:31:53.954]  But the globalists are saying they're going to have a coordinated G20, G24, there's really 24 members at these meetings, devaluation of currencies
[01:31:54.494 --> 01:31:56.014]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:31:56.034 --> 01:31:58.535]  My question has to do specifically with the current status of the dollar bill.
[01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:00.575]  We were informed by alleged moles of the Bilderberg Group back in 08.
[01:32:23.755 --> 01:32:32.480]  That they were not going to drop a dollar until the GDP and the economy rose to the same levels of a decade prior.
[01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:36.542]  We know now that we're well above that.
[01:32:37.163 --> 01:32:40.785]  We're well 2% over where we were a decade ago.
[01:32:41.485 --> 01:32:41.946]  Excuse me.
[01:32:43.827 --> 01:32:46.108]  Now, do you believe that they're just tooting their own horn?
[01:32:46.128 --> 01:32:51.231]  Or are they waiting for more people to try and invest and waste their money?
[01:32:51.747 --> 01:32:55.109]  Okay, so this question goes to the bigger issue.
[01:32:55.489 --> 01:32:58.531]  Webster, bottom line, what is their plan?
[01:32:58.891 --> 01:33:02.593]  We see about a new global constitution of the banks.
[01:33:02.653 --> 01:33:04.334]  They're going to save us from the crisis.
[01:33:04.594 --> 01:33:10.657]  They've created now MSNBC saying double dip recession, double dip housing market.
[01:33:11.318 --> 01:33:13.619]  The banks need more money, more power to save us.
[01:33:14.534 --> 01:33:18.015]  What's actually going on is this attack on the euro.
[01:33:18.075 --> 01:33:25.717]  In other words, people, they don't seem to be giving up on the dollar in the sense that this Bilderberg plan, whatever this was, might suggest.
[01:33:25.777 --> 01:33:43.901]  What you see is Soros, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, the market, in other words, the main finance oligarchs of Wall Street, attacking the euro by means of Greece, the Greek government bond, by means of Spain, Portugal, Ireland, ultimately Italy.
[01:33:44.412 --> 01:33:48.836]  And this is an attack really on Germany, which is the heart of the European Union.
[01:33:48.876 --> 01:34:03.768]  So the reason they're doing that, of course, is they've got a situation where they can make it look like the euro is collapsing faster than the dollar in this general context of a world economic depression of unimaginable proportions and a bottomless
[01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:04.628]  Crisis.
[01:34:04.648 --> 01:34:05.828]  So they don't seem to give up.
[01:34:06.208 --> 01:34:19.431]  And in the meantime, they're making money by speculating against the euro, and they're attempting again to prop up the dollar, and prop up the pound, because the pound is also the thickest currency in Europe.
[01:34:19.471 --> 01:34:33.273]  Now, there is a backlash against some of this stuff, and you have people inside the European Union who are saying, ban hedge funds, and also in a very interesting move, ban credit default swaps.
[01:34:33.795 --> 01:34:34.095]  We're good.
[01:34:47.321 --> 01:34:48.382]  Credit default swap.
[01:34:48.462 --> 01:35:00.474]  So there are some people who are trying to go from economic self-defense, and that will take a protectionist or mercantilist form compared to the free trade which has been practiced so far.
[01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:02.095]  The fact is we're in a depression.
[01:35:02.175 --> 01:35:02.856]  It's getting worse.
[01:35:03.216 --> 01:35:10.263]  The second round of the depression, the second wave of the depression, I think is likely to arrive this year, and that's going to have to do with these
[01:35:11.163 --> 01:35:12.663]  Sovereign bankruptcies, right?
[01:35:12.703 --> 01:35:16.184]  That certain countries can be driven into bankruptcy.
[01:35:16.224 --> 01:35:17.964]  But remember, who's doing this?
[01:35:18.525 --> 01:35:21.125]  Soros, hedge funds, and banks.
[01:35:21.265 --> 01:35:26.986]  In other words, it's a situation where the financial community has declared war on the nation-state.
[01:35:27.366 --> 01:35:32.987]  And I think the nation-state is a better deal than the hedge funds and the bankers.
[01:35:33.047 --> 01:35:36.808]  So I would say it's better for the nation-state to put
[01:35:37.449 --> 01:35:37.909]  J.P.
[01:35:37.949 --> 01:35:42.050]  Morgan Goldman Sachs into bankruptcy than to let them bankrupt the U.S.
[01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:44.911]  government, because that's what it comes down to.
[01:35:47.112 --> 01:35:47.652]  Absolutely.
[01:35:47.692 --> 01:35:49.012]  Let's take another call here.
[01:35:49.472 --> 01:35:51.733]  Let's talk to Rocco in North Carolina.
[01:35:51.753 --> 01:35:52.333]  You're on the air.
[01:35:53.633 --> 01:35:54.894]  Hey, two questions.
[01:35:55.654 --> 01:36:03.056]  When we talk about China, my impression was that China was under the complete control, direct control of the New World Order.
[01:36:03.296 --> 01:36:05.617]  That's why they had a secret security council.
[01:36:07.754 --> 01:36:09.336]  I think this is always an illusion.
[01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:15.926]  The idea that Russia and China are integral parts of something called the New World Order, I think is simply wrong.
[01:36:15.946 --> 01:36:20.692]  It comes from, I think, from not knowing much about these countries.
[01:36:21.053 --> 01:36:22.615]  Well, let me stop you for a minute, Webster.
[01:36:22.635 --> 01:36:24.398]  I want to hear what you have to say on this, but let me be clear.
[01:36:26.175 --> 01:36:32.357]  The West, the British and others, clearly, it's part of the historical record, funded a lot of the Bolsheviks.
[01:36:32.917 --> 01:36:38.299]  Then once Lenin got out of there, Stalin ran Trotsky out, so the West turned against him.
[01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:44.081]  We know Putin did arrest a bunch of the oligarchs when he was vice president and then president.
[01:36:44.761 --> 01:36:47.842]  And it was all over the news that Rothschilds and Rockefellers were the real owners.
[01:36:47.862 --> 01:36:49.342]  That came out in like the Times of London.
[01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:54.392]  We know China did sign deals with the U.S.
[01:36:54.432 --> 01:36:58.276]  in the 70s to set up the eugenics, one-child policy and all this.
[01:36:58.557 --> 01:37:00.138]  So we know they did deals with them.
[01:37:00.519 --> 01:37:05.143]  But still, in any mafia situation, you're going to have different families in the system fighting with each other.
[01:37:05.163 --> 01:37:08.927]  We've had Russia and China call for their own New World Order.
[01:37:09.648 --> 01:37:14.131]  And I'm sure if they were in the position of the British, they would have tried some of the same systems.
[01:37:14.271 --> 01:37:20.335]  So there's certainly collusion at points, but it's like a group of pirate ships in an armada out robbing people.
[01:37:20.676 --> 01:37:23.638]  You are going to have different historical shifts and changes.
[01:37:23.698 --> 01:37:31.703]  But no, this whole system isn't one monolith, but the management system of the technocracy is the same art form.
[01:37:32.444 --> 01:37:33.464]  You go through phases.
[01:37:33.524 --> 01:37:38.488]  You can say in the 1990s, when you had Yeltsin in Moscow, he was a U.S.
[01:37:38.588 --> 01:37:38.888]  puppet.
[01:37:39.301 --> 01:37:45.610]  When you had Jiang Zemin in Beijing, this is somebody who wants globalization, he wants to work with the U.S.
[01:37:45.670 --> 01:37:46.170]  and the British.
[01:37:46.591 --> 01:37:56.304]  Now you have Putin, I think behind the scenes still, who is a Russian nationalist who says, no, we are not the colony in the plantation of the U.S.
[01:37:56.364 --> 01:37:56.865]  and the British.
[01:37:57.438 --> 01:38:00.080]  And you've got this Youth League faction in China.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:12.707]  Well let me stop you again, that's key, because Putin's got a lot of problems, and Russia does all sorts of serious things that I don't agree with, but the Russian government pays people to have children because their population is dying.
[01:38:12.747 --> 01:38:16.369]  It's the only Western country trying to reverse the death of the West.
[01:38:16.749 --> 01:38:19.891]  So it's clear that Russia is breaking with the eugenicist.
[01:38:21.325 --> 01:38:24.347]  Yes, and of course, the question is, there are factions.
[01:38:24.367 --> 01:38:29.652]  There's a pro-British faction, there's a monetarist faction inside Russia, and similarly in China.
[01:38:29.952 --> 01:38:37.998]  The Shanghai Mafia, the Jiang Zemin faction, thinks they're going to take over the presidency with this guy Xi, that's X-I, right?
[01:38:38.018 --> 01:38:39.820]  That's the guy who's supposed to be the next
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.561]  So the Russian-Chinese split is baloney?
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.904]  Well, again, you've got the British in there, and of course the U.S.
[01:39:07.944 --> 01:39:12.688]  and the CIA are trying to do everything they can to divide and conquer, and that's the first place.
[01:39:12.889 --> 01:39:18.735]  The dream scenario for Brzezinski is that you could have a war between Russia and China.
[01:39:18.775 --> 01:39:24.761]  That would be the acme of Brzezinski's achievement, and that's very widely shared.
[01:39:26.062 --> 01:39:36.447]  A report from the Office of Net Assessment in the Pentagon through the Hudson Institute which talks about the Great Siberian War of the year 2030, which is precisely that.
[01:39:36.527 --> 01:39:37.828]  Russia against China.
[01:39:37.868 --> 01:39:43.631]  So there's a whole crew of kooks in the Pentagon and the Foreign Office who think that that's possible.
[01:39:43.931 --> 01:39:45.932]  But I would warn people, the idea
[01:39:46.468 --> 01:39:54.726]  That there's an integral sort of seamless integration of Russia and China into the US-British banking system is wrong.
[01:39:54.886 --> 01:39:56.490]  You're saying that's more of a...
[01:39:57.876 --> 01:40:11.806]  Long-term integration fantasy of Brzezinski and Kissinger, but certainly China has adopted the centralization of the UN and the whole eugenical system.
[01:40:11.986 --> 01:40:16.949]  Russia, more than China, has been rebuking and exposing global warming as a fraud.
[01:40:16.969 --> 01:40:20.772]  Wait, if you look at the Copenhagen conference,
[01:40:21.212 --> 01:40:25.294]  The resistance against global warming was led by Premier Wen.
[01:40:25.755 --> 01:40:27.916]  Now, he did it in a typical Chinese way.
[01:40:27.996 --> 01:40:32.839]  He did it in this indirect, you could call it an inscrutable strategy.
[01:40:33.279 --> 01:40:43.725]  But using Sudan and using some third world countries, it was essentially in Copenhagen, it was Obama against Wen to see if they could impose this carbon dictatorship.
[01:40:44.119 --> 01:40:45.280]  And the answer was no.
[01:40:45.621 --> 01:40:51.946]  In other words, Wen came out on top, the Prime Minister of China, vanquished Obama, and he did a service to the world.
[01:40:52.007 --> 01:40:54.929]  So, they are not included in this planning.
[01:40:55.029 --> 01:40:58.332]  Unfortunately, they pay lip service to a lot of these things.
[01:40:58.373 --> 01:41:02.797]  The Chinese pay lip service to free trade, even though they don't practice it, they have good sense.
[01:41:03.237 --> 01:41:07.141]  They pay lip service to this carbon global warming stuff.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:12.665]  They're not in a strong ideological position, but they're still fighting.
[01:41:12.705 --> 01:41:12.986]  Yeah, hello?
[01:41:24.127 --> 01:41:38.432]  Yeah, I just wondered what Webster had to say about state banks, like the one in North Dakota, and initiatives right now to establish them in Oregon, Vermont, and especially in Florida, where Dr. Fareed Khabari has this idea of a zero-cost economy.
[01:41:39.025 --> 01:41:49.570]  Yeah, that's a good idea I've seen with state banks, some real state banks set up in the last hundred years that give people really low-cost credit and aren't part of the private banking cartel.
[01:41:49.610 --> 01:41:49.951]  Webster?
[01:41:50.311 --> 01:41:53.312]  Look, the state bank is a fine thing, but it's a little thing.
[01:41:53.392 --> 01:41:55.313]  It's a marginal difference.
[01:41:55.454 --> 01:41:56.194]  North Dakota
[01:41:57.272 --> 01:42:01.234]  I just have low unemployment, because if you're unemployed in North Dakota, you leave.
[01:42:01.354 --> 01:42:03.735]  There are very few people left in North Dakota.
[01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:05.796]  So North Dakota is a very bad example.
[01:42:06.196 --> 01:42:11.678]  But on the other hand, it's fine if you're going to do this along the way, but don't think this is going to cause an economic recovery.
[01:42:12.078 --> 01:42:17.001]  Much better in my view, and right now the subject of a big world movement is the Tobin Tax.
[01:42:17.341 --> 01:42:20.082]  It's called the Robin Hood Tax now, in Britain.
[01:42:20.522 --> 01:42:27.770]  In the Labour Party and the Trade Union, there are a bunch of people who realize that they're doomed unless they get some left populist cover.
[01:42:28.211 --> 01:42:30.453]  Webster, we gotta go to break, but I gotta say this.
[01:42:30.974 --> 01:42:36.079]  Webster, the UN's been pushing the Tobin tanks, the bigger... Hold on!
[01:42:36.119 --> 01:42:36.700]  Which kind?
[01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:46.145]  The Tobin tax of the UN and Sarkozy is let's have a tax globally run by the UN and the money goes to the International Monetary Fund.
[01:42:46.305 --> 01:42:47.046]  Obviously not.
[01:42:47.466 --> 01:42:51.948]  But inside Europe, you've got people going with the Robin Hood tax, the financial transaction tax.
[01:42:51.968 --> 01:42:53.029]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:42:53.049 --> 01:42:53.589]  Okay, stay there.
[01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:56.111]  We're going to come back after the break with Webster Griffin.
[01:42:56.131 --> 01:42:58.512]  Tar, please, we cover a wide range of subjects.
[01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:07.795]  If you owe the IRS money you can't pay, then listen carefully because you already know that the problem won't go away by itself.
[01:43:08.255 --> 01:43:12.159]  You can get help today from the leading tax expert in the country, Dan Pilla.
[01:43:12.459 --> 01:43:13.440]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.461]  The IRS isn't going to just forget about you.
[01:43:15.922 --> 01:43:20.665]  Right now, the IRS is hiring thousands of tax collectors to go after delinquent accounts just like yours.
[01:43:21.126 --> 01:43:23.808]  That's why you need to take action today and I can help.
[01:43:24.368 --> 01:43:27.451]  I take a simple but proven approach to solving your tax debt problem.
[01:43:27.911 --> 01:43:31.254]  First, I stabilize collections so you don't have to worry about wage and bank levies.
[01:43:31.775 --> 01:43:37.160]  Next, I build a detailed plan to get your debt reduced to the fullest extent possible, sometimes even eliminated.

[01:44:08.055 --> 01:44:09.478]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:12.839]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:12.859 --> 01:44:19.063]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:19.243 --> 01:44:24.266]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:24.446 --> 01:44:27.588]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:44:27.708 --> 01:44:34.473]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:34.553 --> 01:44:36.674]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:36.914 --> 01:44:38.235]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:38.495 --> 01:44:39.356]  And the Congress is saying,
[01:44:39.716 --> 01:44:40.757]  Who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:40.917 --> 01:44:42.759]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:43.059 --> 01:44:47.883]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:45:28.564 --> 01:45:37.850]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:45:37.890 --> 01:45:44.835]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:45:44.955 --> 01:45:45.776]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:45:45.836 --> 01:45:48.918]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:45:49.078 --> 01:45:49.858]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:45:51.619 --> 01:45:51.900]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:46:04.588 --> 01:46:06.510]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:09.812]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:46:10.292 --> 01:46:12.894]  I've been listening to Bloomberg Radio and watching CNBC.
[01:46:12.914 --> 01:46:15.936]  They go, oh, there's calls for attacks on banks.
[01:46:16.097 --> 01:46:18.879]  And what it is is attacks on all banks.
[01:46:19.899 --> 01:46:21.260]  That's then passed on to customers.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:21.520]  No.
[01:46:22.836 --> 01:46:27.417]  You have a tax on Goldman Sachs, others, the top predatory class.
[01:46:27.757 --> 01:46:30.698]  How about we just remove the Federal Reserve, give it back to Congress?
[01:46:31.338 --> 01:46:32.739]  How about we slash taxes?
[01:46:32.779 --> 01:46:38.320]  That increases the receipts that come in, the tax money.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:39.361]  The system knows this.
[01:46:39.401 --> 01:46:40.621]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50%.
[01:46:42.842 --> 01:46:43.662]  And guess what happened?
[01:46:44.775 --> 01:46:46.036]  Tax money coming in doubled.
[01:46:46.256 --> 01:46:47.237]  The banks don't want that.
[01:46:47.297 --> 01:46:48.297]  They want stagnation.
[01:46:48.317 --> 01:46:49.158]  They want austerity.
[01:46:49.398 --> 01:46:50.379]  They want you bankrupt.
[01:46:50.419 --> 01:46:51.500]  They want the land.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:52.780]  They want the companies.
[01:46:53.301 --> 01:46:59.045]  They openly have financed the phony Green Revolution to destroy our industrialized society.
[01:46:59.085 --> 01:47:05.209]  It's the fake banking parasite system waging war on the real economy and Main Street.
[01:47:05.269 --> 01:47:09.892]  So, Webster, you're saying have nationalist taxes on the banks.
[01:47:10.272 --> 01:47:14.515]  The problem is if you don't remove them as criminals, they'll just engage in economic terrorism.
[01:47:15.415 --> 01:47:17.115]  I say, tax Goldman Sachs.
[01:47:17.596 --> 01:47:19.416]  Slap a tax on Goldman Sachs.
[01:47:20.196 --> 01:47:27.498]  Call it a Tobin tax, a Wall Street sales tax, securities transfer tax, sales tax on them, whatever you want to call it.
[01:47:28.158 --> 01:47:36.199]  If you're in California, or New York, or Illinois, or New Jersey, or Virginia, you've got to advocate a state-level Wall Street sales tax.
[01:47:36.739 --> 01:47:39.140]  For example, if California doesn't do this,
[01:47:39.622 --> 01:47:45.916]  They're going to be bankrupt this year and Goldman Sachs will be attacking them and Soros and all of those hedge funds.
[01:47:46.257 --> 01:47:50.466]  So the only question now is, will you tax Goldman?
[01:47:50.934 --> 01:47:51.974]  And JPMorgan.
[01:47:52.294 --> 01:47:54.255]  And it's on their speculative turnover.
[01:47:54.295 --> 01:47:56.196]  It's not on banks per se.
[01:47:56.556 --> 01:47:58.977]  It's on speculative turnover, mainly derivatives.
[01:47:59.117 --> 01:47:59.557]  No, I know.
[01:47:59.737 --> 01:48:04.879]  I was talking about their proposing a tax that the government grabs that they then give themselves.
[01:48:05.239 --> 01:48:06.359]  And I totally agree with you.
[01:48:06.399 --> 01:48:07.700]  We've got to bring them to justice.
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:10.160]  There's going to be a tax on financial turnover.
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:13.201]  It's the only flow of money in the world that's not taxed.
[01:48:13.722 --> 01:48:17.803]  People pay between 6 and 11 percent on shoes for their kid.
[01:48:18.402 --> 01:48:22.363]  But the bankers, they do flash trading thousands of times a second.
[01:48:22.603 --> 01:48:23.684]  They pay zero.
[01:48:24.084 --> 01:48:31.546]  And now all these states... And now all these states are starting to pass sales taxes on food.
[01:48:31.566 --> 01:48:33.787]  I mean, we can't have milk for... That's awful.
[01:48:33.827 --> 01:48:35.288]  That's regressive taxation.
[01:48:35.328 --> 01:48:36.628]  This is what you cannot have.
[01:48:37.088 --> 01:48:39.809]  Anyway, you have to break the power of Wall Street somehow.
[01:48:40.049 --> 01:48:41.049]  And here's what it's going to be.
[01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:44.811]  Everybody thought the British Labour Party under Gordon Brown was dead, right?
[01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:45.371]  New Labour.
[01:48:45.914 --> 01:48:51.179]  Now you've got this bunch of people, the Labour left in effect, is going for the Robin Hood tax.
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:49:01.009]  If the Conservatives, the Tories in Britain, are going to get defeated in an election that's going to be held now in four, six, eight weeks at the most, this spring,
[01:49:01.573 --> 01:49:16.145]  Then that will kick over into the United States, and all the desperate Democrats and other desperados will say, alright, I gotta get some populist street creds, I'm gonna go with the tax the banks, Tobin tax, and that will bring the issue into the United States.
[01:49:16.486 --> 01:49:17.867]  See, they have what we don't have.
[01:49:17.927 --> 01:49:19.028]  They have organizations.
[01:49:19.408 --> 01:49:21.129]  They have the Trade Union Congress, right?
[01:49:21.170 --> 01:49:23.932]  The Germans have the DGB trade unions.
[01:49:23.972 --> 01:49:24.813]  We don't have any of that.
[01:49:24.833 --> 01:49:25.974]  We're completely atomized.
[01:49:26.274 --> 01:49:28.616]  So the only way this kind of thing could come into the U.S.
[01:49:29.036 --> 01:49:30.177]  But Webster, here's the reason they're for it.
[01:49:50.895 --> 01:49:56.539]  We don't need to call it a Tobin tax because they're going to end up with the global and regional Tobin tax bait-and-switch.
[01:49:56.999 --> 01:49:59.520]  They'll have the banks come out and say they're not for it when they're for it.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:03.102]  We won't get a national tax on them, we'll get their global system.
[01:50:03.122 --> 01:50:05.163]  So we've got to watch out for that happening.
[01:50:06.404 --> 01:50:12.150]  Take a look at the article on my website, tarpley.net, and then take a look at this Robin Hood tax.
[01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:21.981]  There's this British actor, Bill Nye, and they have a dramatization of this fat cat in the city of London who has to admit that there's no reason why... Okay, Webster, we're out of time.
[01:50:22.001 --> 01:50:22.641]  The show's over.
[01:50:22.681 --> 01:50:24.543]  I want to say bye to you, though, so don't hang up.
[01:50:24.583 --> 01:50:25.684]  I want to talk to you about a couple of things.
[01:50:26.425 --> 01:50:27.867]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:27.987 --> 01:50:30.330]  Jam-packed key info on the InfoWars streams.
[01:50:30.691 --> 01:50:32.734]  Re-aired on the MNFM out there.
[01:50:32.794 --> 01:50:33.655]  God bless you all.
[01:50:33.715 --> 01:50:34.496]  Great job to the crew.
