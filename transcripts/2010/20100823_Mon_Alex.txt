[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:09.636]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:11.237]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:12.778]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:16.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:21.024]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:25.623]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:29.485]  You have found the front lines of the information war.
[00:00:29.485 --> 00:00:32.266]  The global awakening is accelerating.
[00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.307]  It is Monday, the 23rd day of August, 2010.
[00:00:35.307 --> 00:00:46.053]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, economist and historian, will be joining us to talk about the massive intensification of preparations for war.
[00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:49.031]  We're good to go.
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.007]  Off the charts increases in cancers and deformities from depleted uranium.
[00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:26.800]  The Army's own reports from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s admit this is deadly, not just to the people it's used on, but for the troops that use the weapons as well.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.143]  So this just goes to the mindset of the globalist.
[00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:32.448]  Iraqi Bishop says U.S.
[00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:33.729]  betrayed country.
[00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.333]  Christians suffer the most.
[00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:44.704]  And so we'll look at the fake withdrawal as well with Webster Griffin Tarpley coming up in the next hour as well.
[00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:48.414]  Listeners did it again last Friday.
[00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:52.035]  This time we had three Bilderberg Group-associated search terms.
[00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:54.156]  All three made it into the top slots.
[00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.697]  Number one, number two, and number three.
[00:01:56.697 --> 00:02:08.701]  And then literally hundreds of blogs, scores of newspapers, then wrote reports about Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, The Obama Deception, both films that exposed the Bilderberg Group and the shadow government.
[00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:15.163]  And so hundreds of thousands of people have been exposed to the truth with one failed swoop, with one powerful blow,
[00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:19.464]  Good job to everyone taking action on that front.
[00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:27.286]  Continuing with other news, there's a PrisonPlanet.com report today.
[00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:37.668]  Not only did John P. Holdren in the 70s, the White House science czar, call for sterilization chemicals to be put in the water, forced world population reduction, global government to enforce it.
[00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:47.769]  He also in 2006 wrote about similar things four years ago and now we have a new 1992 document that's been discovered.
[00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.731]  A publication reaffirms devotion to population control through global effort.
[00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:55.632]  And of course there's another report here from the BBC.
[00:02:55.632 --> 00:02:59.854]  They're going to have a series of broadcasts promoting
[00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:15.638]  Forced sterilization of people who are just mentally ill or who are handicapped, but also those that have shown a history of being criminal, morally unfit, or drinking alcohol.
[00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:20.041]  Good enough for Hitler, good enough for England.
[00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:23.484]  So a similar system being promoted there as if it's a wonderful thing.
[00:03:23.484 --> 00:03:24.985]  The BBC is now promoting that.
[00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:31.830]  And of course another InfoWars.com article from two weeks ago that integrates in with this.
[00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:40.937]  Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass-scale fertility reproduction sterilization compounds added to the vaccines.
[00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:42.959]  We know that that is ongoing now.
[00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.942]  So that is coming up.
[00:03:46.942 --> 00:03:50.886]  Also, new Logan Searches blasted TSA test.
[00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.291]  Uh, frisky, frisking policy.
[00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:57.592]  And they always roll it out in a test airport.
[00:03:57.592 --> 00:04:02.913]  Normally, Boston Logan, for some reason, they put body scanners in there, what, five years ago.
[00:04:02.913 --> 00:04:06.895]  Now they're going nationwide last year and this year into every major airport.
[00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:09.195]  First they say, well, you can do a pat-down if you want.
[00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:11.956]  Now they're saying, well, it's going to be mandatory to be body scanned.
[00:04:11.956 --> 00:04:13.757]  And they admit they are saving the images now.
[00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:29.273]  In this report, people are getting mad because they now squeeze the breasts, squeeze the genitals, and they don't just lightly frisk, they now train you to have government in your personal space.
[00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:35.457]  And I don't know why people are complaining about jail guards getting in trouble for squeezing women's breasts.
[00:04:35.457 --> 00:04:36.597]  Actually, I know why they're complaining.
[00:04:36.597 --> 00:04:37.478]  They should be.
[00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:39.299]  But why are they complaining if this is going on?
[00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:43.741]  We have the newscast showing where they grab women's breasts and actually squeeze them.
[00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:52.226]  So now, not only will they record you and your wife and your children naked in the scanners, they'll also squeeze your breasts and genitals, training you to submit to tyranny.
[00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:54.307]  This is all promoting, of course, forced
[00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:04.017]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.017 --> 00:05:08.362]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:13.748]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:14.829]  It's true.
[00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:20.535]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:24.119]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:28.843]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:31.606]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:31.606 --> 00:05:34.950]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.212]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:45.255]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.255 --> 00:05:49.437]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:51.217]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:03.501]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:09.926]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:09.926 --> 00:06:17.312]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:17.312 --> 00:06:22.175]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:06:30.282 --> 00:06:32.865]  I'm happy to say, our business is going down the drain.

[00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.422]  Thank you.

[00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:47.709]  Big Brother.
[00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:48.369]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:49.010]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:14.726]  You want answers?
[00:08:14.726 --> 00:08:16.646]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:25.109]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:26.409]  We are live!
[00:08:26.409 --> 00:08:29.990]  It is Monday, 23rd day of August, 2010.
[00:08:32.907 --> 00:08:47.175]  Let's dive straight into the news ahead of a deep breakdown of what's happening with the economy worldwide and the massive acceleration with the Israeli Knesset mirroring their propaganda arm Atlantic Monthly.
[00:08:47.175 --> 00:08:51.578]  Last week, they now came out over the weekend and said, we are preparing to strike Iran.
[00:08:51.578 --> 00:08:53.399]  We are going to strike Iran.
[00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:56.961]  They've now fueled the reactor at Bashir.
[00:08:56.961 --> 00:09:00.723]  If it is hit, it could cause a Chernobyl-type reaction.
[00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:01.824]  But the system doesn't care.
[00:09:02.364 --> 00:09:12.789]  Just 15 years ago, the Pentagon admitted that DU was deadly for our troops that use it, deadly for the areas for billions of years where the DU is used.
[00:09:12.789 --> 00:09:25.615]  It's now used in hundreds of different types of munitions, not just two or three different types of munitions like bunker busters and anti-tank weapons fired from Vulcan cannons and A-10 war dogs or SABOs in Abrams
[00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.297]  I don't think so.
[00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:56.788]  And just like the 9-11 workers, or just like the Exxon Valdez workers, or now the Gulf oil spill workers, when they get sick and start dying, they say, look, no health care for you, go crawl in a hole and die.
[00:09:56.788 --> 00:10:01.231]  We only want to wrap you in the American flag when we bury your butt.
[00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:02.972]  We're here to use you.
[00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:06.875]  We are the global New World Order takeover system.
[00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:09.837]  And that's the bottom line of what's happening here.
[00:10:09.837 --> 00:10:11.298]  We're going to be going over that today.
[00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:21.848]  I also want to get into Obama's poll numbers continuing to collapse and the headline out of the Telegraph, does Barack Obama want to be re-elected in 2010?
[00:10:21.848 --> 00:10:39.197]  Meanwhile, he's got the Mexican president here again running around saying he wants semi-automatics banned in America and it's also being reported by New York newspapers that Mexican police are to patrol New York City making sure Mexicans aren't discriminated against.
[00:10:39.197 --> 00:10:39.678]  Meanwhile,
[00:10:40.698 --> 00:10:47.745]  All over the country in Mexico, the police will come to the mayor, or to a governor's house, or to a U.S.
[00:10:47.745 --> 00:10:52.169]  consulate, and they'll walk Mexican government people out, U.S.
[00:10:52.169 --> 00:10:54.492]  government people out, and they'll kill you in the street.
[00:10:54.492 --> 00:10:56.534]  They'll even rape you and cut your head off.
[00:10:57.154 --> 00:10:57.654]  I don't know.
[00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:28.875]  I mean, it's just amazing to see this going on.
[00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:33.400]  So I want to go back over some of the latest developments on that front today.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.146]  And then obviously I talked about some of this yesterday on the Sunday broadcast from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:11:38.146 --> 00:11:39.087]  Central.
[00:11:39.087 --> 00:11:40.388]  It's all over the media.
[00:11:40.388 --> 00:11:42.271]  It's in my local paper every day.
[00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:43.792]  It's all over TV.
[00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:45.554]  They're saying part of back to school.
[00:11:46.175 --> 00:11:49.856]  But every American needs it, is your H1N1 shot.
[00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:54.277]  And they've got tens of millions of dosages that they couldn't get people to take last year.
[00:11:54.277 --> 00:11:58.759]  They're just going to push last year's H1N1, an admitted hoax by the British Medical Journal.
[00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.019]  They admit it's a hoax.
[00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:03.220]  The European Union Medical Commission admits it's a hoax.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.361]  They admit it's a tenfold increase in convulsions if you take it.
[00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:07.762]  That's mainstream news.
[00:12:07.762 --> 00:12:12.163]  And they're just going to run the whole hoax again, and hype it up, and scare everybody.
[00:12:12.603 --> 00:12:17.785]  And find a few people that have compromised immune systems or who've got cancer, who die of the flu.
[00:12:17.785 --> 00:12:19.826]  They're gonna hype it and tell you you gotta take it.
[00:12:19.826 --> 00:12:26.988]  And there's no doubt that in these vaccines, we're seeing massive increases in infertility or full-born sterilization.
[00:12:26.988 --> 00:12:29.929]  We're seeing massive increases in cancer.
[00:12:29.929 --> 00:12:33.210]  And it's all on the drug insert that it can cause this and do this.
[00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.091]  And they don't care!
[00:12:35.091 --> 00:12:36.572]  They don't care!
[00:12:36.572 --> 00:12:37.432]  That's just the way it is!
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.140]  Gardasil, you take it, it kills you.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.501]  Prozac, you take it.
[00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:45.381]  Absolutely attacks every organ in your body, including the brain.
[00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:48.702]  Massively increases suicide, violent tendencies.
[00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:49.302]  They don't care.
[00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:52.183]  They put it on the insert and push it on you.
[00:12:52.183 --> 00:12:53.343]  Just all admitted.
[00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:54.723]  It's like all these drug ads I hear.
[00:12:54.723 --> 00:12:56.344]  It goes, oh, you're having trouble sleeping?
[00:12:56.344 --> 00:12:56.764]  Take this.
[00:12:56.764 --> 00:12:58.984]  It may make you have a heart attack or go crazy.
[00:12:58.984 --> 00:13:01.005]  Oh, you have to urinate every few hours?
[00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:02.285]  Well, that's not normal.
[00:13:02.285 --> 00:13:02.825]  Take this.
[00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:06.386]  It may make you a psychopathic killer or give you a heart attack or brain cancer, but so what?
[00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:10.712]  On and on and on.
[00:13:10.712 --> 00:13:14.854]  We are in a pharmacological dictatorship.
[00:13:14.854 --> 00:13:17.214]  And I was thinking about it this weekend.
[00:13:17.214 --> 00:13:23.796]  I was looking at my wife's SUV, and it's got a big key down the side of it that she got at a grocery store parking lot.
[00:13:23.796 --> 00:13:24.796]  And it happened about a year ago.
[00:13:24.796 --> 00:13:26.317]  We haven't fixed it.
[00:13:26.317 --> 00:13:26.977]  We don't really care.
[00:13:27.714 --> 00:13:32.816]  You know, once the car really gets banged up enough over the next four or five years, we'll probably, you know, get it repainted or something.
[00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:37.258]  But we're not, you know, too much, you know, into aesthetics, long as the vehicle runs well.
[00:13:37.258 --> 00:13:44.241]  But it just struck me that the ultimate form of control is drugging people and poisoning people.
[00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:49.304]  That's the ultimate form of domination, is controlling who can have children.
[00:13:49.304 --> 00:13:52.045]  It's putting things in the water to lower your IQ.
[00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:54.286]  That's the ultimate stealth assault.
[00:13:55.006 --> 00:14:01.131]  And the globalists in a thousand different ways or more key our brains.
[00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:07.375]  It's like a dog that goes over and urinates on somebody's fence post to mark this is my territory.
[00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:10.438]  This is all part of this territorial domination.
[00:14:10.438 --> 00:14:11.418]  That's what all of this
[00:14:13.456 --> 00:14:16.077]  Forced inoculation is about.
[00:14:16.077 --> 00:14:24.980]  It's what the TSA, naked body scanning, you and your family, your wife, your children, yourself, your brother, your sister, your mother, your father.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:36.504]  Now, they're enhancing the frisk, where, and this is in the mainstream news, where they grab your breast and squeeze them to make sure they're not bombs, and they grab your genitals and squeeze them.
[00:14:36.504 --> 00:14:38.125]  I'd already seen this on the news.
[00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:41.946]  It would show the enhanced pat-down, and they go around the woman's breast.
[00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:42.647]  Men do this.
[00:14:43.547 --> 00:14:45.568]  Women frisk men.
[00:14:45.568 --> 00:14:46.508]  Men frisk women.
[00:14:46.508 --> 00:14:48.629]  It's all about breaking taboos.
[00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:56.053]  That's why the Pentagon admits they now have joint showers for men and women at many bases and joint sleeping quarters.
[00:14:56.053 --> 00:15:06.018]  You know, it's enough to get your personal space broken down to be in the military and to have to sit there on the head using the bathroom right next to dozens of other men.
[00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:19.977]  But imagine, you've got to sit there right next to a woman, and she's sitting on the commode, and you're sitting on the commode, and the social engineers over a hundred years ago, the eugenicists said, they would break down the distinction of family.
[00:15:19.977 --> 00:15:21.139]  Men and women.
[00:15:21.139 --> 00:15:23.862]  They would divide the different racial groups against each other.
[00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:28.186]  This is their tool of total control.
[00:15:28.186 --> 00:15:37.572]  It's savage social engineering of, we're going to have police take your blood at warrantless nighttime checkpoints on the side of the road to get in your comfort space.
[00:15:37.572 --> 00:15:40.955]  We're going to take your baby's blood at birth and put it in a DNA database.
[00:15:40.955 --> 00:15:43.817]  And we lied to you for decades, but now we admit what it's really for.
[00:15:44.477 --> 00:15:52.986]  And we're gonna naked scan you at the courthouses, and the shopping malls, and the federal courthouses, and the airports, and at the public schools.
[00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:53.947]  Folks, I didn't even know this.
[00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:55.608]  It's actually going in public schools.
[00:15:55.608 --> 00:15:56.870]  It's going in colleges.
[00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.352]  All federal courthouses are now getting it.
[00:15:59.352 --> 00:16:02.455]  They store all the images, just total control.
[00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:07.521]  Naked body scanners three years ago on the streets of London, just randomly making people go through them.
[00:16:08.561 --> 00:16:12.482]  Cops walk up randomly, line citizens up, say, show me your ID.
[00:16:12.482 --> 00:16:13.923]  It's happened to me in England.
[00:16:13.923 --> 00:16:16.144]  It's happened to Steve Watson.
[00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:17.024]  He's with his girlfriend.
[00:16:17.024 --> 00:16:18.664]  They're jealous because she's good looking.
[00:16:18.664 --> 00:16:21.045]  He's walking around 8 o'clock at night in a nice neighborhood.
[00:16:21.045 --> 00:16:21.745]  They line up.
[00:16:21.745 --> 00:16:22.466]  Give me your papers.
[00:16:22.466 --> 00:16:23.646]  You may be a terrorist.
[00:16:23.646 --> 00:16:27.427]  It's all about the government telling you when to jump.
[00:16:27.427 --> 00:16:29.408]  And you say, yes, sir, master.
[00:16:29.408 --> 00:16:30.408]  Yes, sir, boss.
[00:16:30.408 --> 00:16:31.769]  How high?
[00:16:31.769 --> 00:16:32.729]  I said, jump.
[00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:33.489]  Yes, sir, boss.
[00:16:33.489 --> 00:16:34.910]  How high?
[00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.271]  I said, get out there and pick that cotton boy.
[00:16:37.271 --> 00:16:37.611]  Yes, sir.
[00:16:38.743 --> 00:16:41.424]  I don't like how you said it!
[00:16:41.424 --> 00:16:45.545]  Drop to the ground and give me 25, scumbag!
[00:16:45.545 --> 00:16:46.826]  It's all brainwashing.
[00:16:46.826 --> 00:16:49.407]  It's all induction into slavery.
[00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:52.448]  You and your family, everything going into bondage.
[00:16:52.448 --> 00:16:54.549]  Now they're getting you ready to take your pension funds.
[00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:57.910]  Getting you ready to take part of your social security and raise the retirement age.
[00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.690]  Getting you ready to lose your property.
[00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:03.352]  Getting you ready to have big agribusiness take over your farm and ranch.
[00:17:03.352 --> 00:17:05.732]  Getting you ready for total enslavement.
[00:17:05.732 --> 00:17:06.933]  Just setting the precedence.
[00:17:08.052 --> 00:17:21.220]  Now, I saw two articles yesterday, and I've been investigating the Tidon-Hutto FEMA Center, because it's also not just for foreigners, but for citizens as well, this residential FEMA camp.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:34.748]  And I noticed in the news that a jail guard is set, he's been arrested, he's now gonna be indicted, because picking up people at the airport to be taken to the immigration facility, the FEMA camp,
[00:17:35.782 --> 00:17:45.150]  He would reportedly frisk them, and he was trained in enhanced search, and he would do rings around their breasts, reportedly, and pat their buttocks.
[00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:56.799]  Well, I mean, it's on the news that you line up with your wife and children, and it's on the news them taking six-year-old girls and boys and squeezing them, training them good how to be in Nazi Germany.
[00:17:56.799 --> 00:18:03.565]  So, my issue is, you notice that they'll indict their own minions for doing it at a prison,
[00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:14.132]  But they won't indict their own people because they're trained to do it now at Boston Logan and other airports where they're beta testing this.
[00:18:14.132 --> 00:18:15.213]  So here's the article.
[00:18:15.213 --> 00:18:18.838]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:18.838 --> 00:18:21.761]  There's actually several articles up there about this subject.
[00:18:21.761 --> 00:18:23.864]  New Logan searches blasted.
[00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:30.187]  TSA test frisky, frisking policy.
[00:18:30.187 --> 00:18:34.130]  And it says now, before they lightly touch, now they squeeze.
[00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.812]  You can see it on the news.
[00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:39.014]  They get around the breast and they go, mm, mm, mm.
[00:18:39.014 --> 00:18:43.017]  And if a woman has a piercing, they take pliers, they make them take it out.
[00:18:43.017 --> 00:18:45.720]  They have men frisking women, women frisking men.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.723]  It's all about getting through your comfort zones, okay?
[00:18:51.511 --> 00:19:03.501]  And it goes through this whole article to say, and the ACLU says, oh, we agree there needs to be searches because, you know, there are terrorists and they do need to pat you down and naked body scan you, but what about squeezing the breast?
[00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:04.822]  You know, is this okay?
[00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:06.083]  What about grabbing the genitals?
[00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:06.763]  Is this okay?
[00:19:06.763 --> 00:19:08.645]  Well, here's the article.
[00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:12.448]  Eight victims ID'd in Huddo Guard Case.
[00:19:12.448 --> 00:19:14.710]  Tensions mounting between facility and the county.
[00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:20.315]  And Williamson County's wanting to search the place and go after him and boy, they're gonna stop this.
[00:19:20.315 --> 00:19:23.157]  Why don't you go to your own airport up there?
[00:19:23.157 --> 00:19:28.462]  Where is the Sheriff's Department in Travis County for children and pedophile laws being broken?
[00:19:28.462 --> 00:19:33.988]  In fact, even the Associated Press admits, as well as London Telegraph, same thing in England, it breaks pedophilia laws.
[00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:45.508]  In fact, that's how they got him to stop scanning under 18-year-olds at the Denver State Courthouse, the county courthouse, because they pointed out in lawsuits that this violates pedophilia laws.
[00:19:45.508 --> 00:19:51.733]  So, hey, why don't you raid the federal-controlled airports where they've just seized this new jurisdiction?
[00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:52.433]  Why don't you go there?
[00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:56.437]  And it says he patted their breast as part of a search.
[00:19:56.437 --> 00:19:58.118]  Well, that's what they're trained to do!
[00:19:58.118 --> 00:20:00.420]  They're trained to grab your woman's breast!
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.022]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?

[00:24:12.867 --> 00:24:33.901]  So finishing up on this story, you've got this T. Don Hutto Federal Family Center, residential center, where they hold citizens, not just non-citizens, we've confirmed, it's even been in the local papers, at this facility, that this gentleman who's being charged
[00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:39.269]  There's a big federal investigation and a county investigation.
[00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:54.557]  He would pick them up at the airport and then frisk them, and because he touched their buttocks, reportedly, allegedly, and frisked around their breast, that they're now going after him criminally, and there's a federal investigation.
[00:24:54.557 --> 00:24:57.858]  What do you think those women went through to get on the plane?
[00:24:57.858 --> 00:25:00.440]  But see, it's this helter-skelter
[00:25:01.827 --> 00:25:20.700]  Oxymoron, hypocritical system, where on the Federal Reservations, where they've just seized the airports, outside of the Constitution, outside of the Bill of Rights, and have put these security measures in place, everything that's done at the airports is training for the streets of America, the schools of America.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:31.262]  The courthouses of America, and I saw Governor Ridge eight years ago admit this before Homeland Security even got congressional funding and became a cabinet position.
[00:25:31.262 --> 00:25:34.023]  And now they're rolling it out against the population.
[00:25:34.023 --> 00:25:34.863]  It goes on.
[00:25:34.863 --> 00:25:37.804]  Eight victims ID'd in a Hutto guard case.
[00:25:37.804 --> 00:25:40.544]  Tensions mounting between facility and county.
[00:25:40.544 --> 00:25:47.406]  Williamson County authorities said that eight victims had been identified in connection with a former
[00:25:48.146 --> 00:25:58.870]  Transport officer at the Tidon-Hutto Immigration Detention Facility who police say groped several women he was supposed to be talking, taking to the airports and bus stations.
[00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:04.753]  No sexual assault charges have been filed, however, although Williamson County officials said they may later on.
[00:26:05.762 --> 00:26:18.225]  Currently, Donald Charles Dunn, 30, faces three charges of official oppression and two charges of unlawful restraint in connection with five victims police said were molested in Williamson County.
[00:26:18.225 --> 00:26:21.186]  And they go on to say he touched their breasts reportedly.
[00:26:21.186 --> 00:26:26.827]  Well, what do I have right here in this article out of the Boston Herald?
[00:26:26.827 --> 00:26:28.608]  New Logan searches blasted.
[00:26:29.773 --> 00:26:44.084]  TSA test frisky frisking policy and they admit in the AP and in the London Telegraph that it violates, as well as the Guardian, it violates US and British child porn laws.
[00:26:44.084 --> 00:26:47.406]  They are recording children as young as one year.
[00:26:47.406 --> 00:26:54.972]  They put babies in these body scanners and record them and their genitals and then they save the images
[00:26:55.712 --> 00:26:56.932]  And got caught lying about it.
[00:26:56.932 --> 00:27:12.097]  Remember all the cases of fistfights where they make TSA workers go through and every day that was what Reuters made fun of the man's genitals until he punched his supervisor in the face and they went on to admit yes they were making fun of him and other women.
[00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:15.458]  Hey baby you got a nice nice rack.
[00:27:15.458 --> 00:27:20.140]  I mean these are this is in the newspaper and we just put up with this.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.902]  I will not have my wife and children go through these.
[00:27:23.902 --> 00:27:26.523]  And they're now saying, well, we're going to make everybody do it now.
[00:27:26.523 --> 00:27:27.504]  No, you're not.
[00:27:27.504 --> 00:27:30.686]  And they'll take me in the back at the airport and probably beat the daylights out of me.
[00:27:30.686 --> 00:27:31.886]  It's what they do.
[00:27:31.886 --> 00:27:33.127]  They kill people all the time.
[00:27:33.127 --> 00:27:35.769]  They beat them to death and say, we don't know why they died.
[00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:50.119]  Logan Airport security just got more up close and personal as federal screeners launched a more aggressive palms-first slide-down body search technique that has renewed the debate over privacy versus safety.
[00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:51.541]  Oh, as if it's to keep you safe.
[00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:55.504]  Who's going to keep us safe from this tyrannical government that's training us to let them do this?
[00:27:56.044 --> 00:28:05.107]  The new procedure already being questioned by the ACLU replaces the Transportation Administration's former back-of-the-hands palm-down, as if that's okay.
[00:28:05.107 --> 00:28:11.949]  Folks, I've got the newscast, we've played them here, where it shows the women's breasts through their shirt, and they touch around them.
[00:28:12.569 --> 00:28:16.671]  I've talked to women, people's wives and girlfriends that work here.
[00:28:16.671 --> 00:28:21.432]  I've talked to friends who talk about, women have called in, it's been on the news.
[00:28:21.432 --> 00:28:35.658]  There's video where they grab your breast and then rub the inside of your legs, and then they take you behind closed doors and make you take your shirt and pants off sometimes, or they put you in glass areas in front of everyone and make you take your pants off.
[00:28:35.658 --> 00:28:37.218]  This has all been on record.
[00:28:37.218 --> 00:28:38.979]  What will we put up with next?
[00:28:39.841 --> 00:28:40.782]  Well, I'll tell you.
[00:28:40.782 --> 00:28:41.862]  It's in the Executive Order 1994.
[00:28:41.862 --> 00:28:46.305]  And it was never implemented.
[00:28:46.305 --> 00:28:47.226]  But now they're trying.
[00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:52.209]  Bill Clinton's Executive Order covered my first film, made 13-plus years ago, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:28:52.209 --> 00:28:55.532]  I read the Executive Order in the DPS, Driver's License Facility.
[00:28:55.532 --> 00:28:56.332]  They then arrest me.
[00:28:56.332 --> 00:28:57.373]  I read it to the crowd there.
[00:28:58.516 --> 00:29:02.278]  Or it says, blood and urine testing to get a driver's license.
[00:29:02.278 --> 00:29:12.444]  And now I have news articles in the last few months saying, oh, Arizona and other states are looking at urine and blood testing or DNA swabs to get a driver's license.
[00:29:12.444 --> 00:29:18.447]  Or, anyone pulled over will, England's already started this, will have a swab from the inside of the cheek.
[00:29:18.447 --> 00:29:23.750]  It takes the cells off the side, some of the largest cells in the body, very easy to scrape off, to put in a DNA database.
[00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:29.242]  And they're already taking your baby's blood at birth for 38 years, secretly, now admitted.
[00:29:29.242 --> 00:29:36.006]  This is how criminal and how sneaky they are and how they get away with all of this garbage.
[00:29:36.006 --> 00:29:43.331]  Go read how they're grabbing your breasts and genitals now and saying it's for your own safety to stop Al-Ci-Ada, I mean Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:47.073]  All right, we're gonna come back, get into a bunch of other key news straight ahead.
[00:29:47.073 --> 00:29:50.536]  Webster Tarpley's coming up and your phone calls.
[00:29:50.536 --> 00:29:53.438]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.449 --> 00:29:59.675]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:02.798]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:30:02.798 --> 00:30:06.602]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:30:06.602 --> 00:30:09.485]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:30:09.485 --> 00:30:14.410]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:20.792]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:30:20.792 --> 00:30:23.133]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[00:30:23.133 --> 00:30:26.455]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:30:26.455 --> 00:30:30.997]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:30:30.997 --> 00:30:39.480]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.281]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:30:41.701 --> 00:30:44.063]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:44.063 --> 00:30:51.910]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.

[00:30:59.617 --> 00:31:04.602]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:31:04.602 --> 00:31:05.603]  What have we got?
[00:31:05.603 --> 00:31:08.045]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:31:08.045 --> 00:31:09.066]  A republic.
[00:31:09.066 --> 00:31:11.708]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:31:11.708 --> 00:31:13.970]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.992]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:31:15.992 --> 00:31:17.674]  So they think they own our land?
[00:31:17.674 --> 00:31:18.995]  They think they own our water?
[00:31:18.995 --> 00:31:19.596]  Children?
[00:31:19.596 --> 00:31:20.717]  Our education?
[00:31:20.717 --> 00:31:21.557]  Our money?
[00:31:21.557 --> 00:31:25.201]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:31:25.561 --> 00:31:30.527]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:31:30.527 --> 00:31:31.548]  We have the facts.
[00:31:31.548 --> 00:31:32.730]  We have the Constitution.
[00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.631]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:31:33.631 --> 00:31:34.512]  We have common law.
[00:31:34.512 --> 00:31:37.035]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:37.035 --> 00:31:40.819]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:45.864]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:31:45.864 --> 00:31:47.365]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:31:47.365 --> 00:31:48.466]  Don't tread on me.
[00:31:48.466 --> 00:31:55.333]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:31:59.437 --> 00:32:03.979]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:03.979 --> 00:32:04.899]  Number 1.
[00:32:04.899 --> 00:32:08.320]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.180]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:14.082]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.082 --> 00:32:14.822]  It's true.
[00:32:14.822 --> 00:32:19.684]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.684 --> 00:32:20.524]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.524 --> 00:32:24.106]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:27.807]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.007 --> 00:32:28.808]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:31.571]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:35.256]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.256 --> 00:32:36.037]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:40.202]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.202 --> 00:32:44.948]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.228 --> 00:32:49.409]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.409 --> 00:32:51.190]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.431]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.431 --> 00:32:55.732]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:55.732 --> 00:33:04.354]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.408 --> 00:33:32.469]  We are back live.
[00:33:32.469 --> 00:33:38.954]  I'm going to continue rolling through the key news on a host of subjects.
[00:33:38.954 --> 00:33:40.335]  Then Webster Carpley joins us.
[00:33:40.335 --> 00:33:42.717]  We'll have open phones while Webster's on with us.
[00:33:42.717 --> 00:33:45.299]  And, of course, with a full third hour, open phones.
[00:33:45.299 --> 00:33:47.361]  I'll go ahead and give that number out now.
[00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:48.642]  I may even get to some this hour.
[00:33:48.642 --> 00:33:48.682]  1-800-259.
[00:33:52.325 --> 00:33:54.849]  9231 and we will get you up and on the air.
[00:33:54.849 --> 00:33:56.251]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:18.039]  Now I want to get into eugenics, I want to get into the economy, I want to get into Philly requiring bloggers to pay $300 for a business license.
[00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:25.666]  Anyone who has any type of website, including Facebook blogs, they want $300 a year.
[00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:29.669]  They're saying you have no right to free speech, you must pay the government for the privilege.
[00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:31.531]  They actually use the word privilege.
[00:34:32.071 --> 00:34:35.913]  They say free speech is a privilege.
[00:34:35.913 --> 00:34:37.013]  This is out of the Examiner.
[00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:41.276]  It's one of the top stories on Drugs Report, and it should be.
[00:34:41.276 --> 00:34:44.097]  So we'll be going over all of that today.
[00:34:44.097 --> 00:34:48.139]  We've also got some new national polls showing Obama continuing to slip.
[00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:53.722]  And the question is, does Barack Obama want to be re-elected in 2012?
[00:34:53.722 --> 00:34:55.763]  But I want to get to another issue first.
[00:34:55.763 --> 00:35:00.085]  Glenn Beck channels Alex Jones in New York Times best-selling book.
[00:35:01.078 --> 00:35:03.580]  And I got a copy of the book that was sent to me about a week ago.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.721]  I've only had a chance to scan over it.
[00:35:05.721 --> 00:35:08.684]  I haven't finished it, but listeners have read it.
[00:35:08.684 --> 00:35:14.148]  Watson has read the reviews of it and has scanned over some of the sections that are online and confirmed.
[00:35:15.319 --> 00:35:21.902]  But the main character is yours truly in the faction book, as Beck calls it.
[00:35:21.902 --> 00:35:25.203]  Part fiction, part non-fiction.
[00:35:25.203 --> 00:35:27.344]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[00:35:27.344 --> 00:35:30.345]  And I'm the hero in the book.
[00:35:30.345 --> 00:35:34.967]  And so we'll discuss why is he doing something like that in just a moment.
[00:35:36.561 --> 00:35:41.566]  But before I do that, don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, this broadcast is listener-supported.
[00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:50.234]  When you buy a high-quality Patriot t-shirt, you not only get a walking billboard to get the word out and meet like-minded people, you fund our operation.
[00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:52.837]  When you support the sponsors, you fund our operation.
[00:35:52.837 --> 00:35:55.860]  When you get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, you fund our operation.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:06.127]  When you buy the books and videos, not just the books I've written or the films I've produced or directed or the other films I carry, you make this whole radio show possible.
[00:36:06.127 --> 00:36:16.333]  Plus, the very best videos and books that I read or that I watch, we go out, we buy them in bulk, we discount them, we sell them to you to then show them to your friends and family.
[00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:25.960]  But all of my films, you are encouraged to make copies of them for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes, to air them on AXS Television, to give them to everyone you know in your area.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.182]  And the awakening is now here.
[00:36:29.182 --> 00:36:31.965]  In fact, I'm about to talk about that dealing with Glenn Beck in a moment.
[00:36:31.965 --> 00:36:34.046]  The awakening is turbocharged.
[00:36:34.046 --> 00:36:43.454]  We need to super turbocharge this to the next level because we don't know how long we're going to have the free internet before they launch a false flag attack on it.
[00:36:43.454 --> 00:36:52.162]  We don't know how long we have before they stage major terror attacks here or abroad to really clamp down this brigade homeland.
[00:36:53.513 --> 00:36:57.178]  Top Secret USA spy grid that they've set up.
[00:36:57.178 --> 00:37:01.183]  They've got their system set up and infiltrating every facet of society.
[00:37:01.183 --> 00:37:10.155]  Now is the time to intensify the wake-up call for everyone across this country and worldwide, and I'm begging you.
[00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:30.220]  To spread the word about the radio broadcast, to send links to the free podcast, or to the free iPhone app to everyone you know, to get my films, to make copies of them, and the special ends today where you can buy one copy of Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, excellent new documentary exposing the whole globalist system and their crimes.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.221]  Buy one copy, get three copies free.
[00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:33.962]  Buy two copies, get eight copies free.
[00:37:34.542 --> 00:37:39.486]  You can buy one copy of Fall of the Republic, and you get three copies free.
[00:37:39.486 --> 00:37:42.368]  Buy two copies of Fall of the Republic, get eight free.
[00:37:42.368 --> 00:37:45.190]  You can do the same thing for Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.651]  Buy one copy, get three free.
[00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:49.012]  Buy two copies, get eight free.
[00:37:49.012 --> 00:37:52.955]  And finish your Christmas shopping early, before the whole season starts.
[00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:54.276]  Don't fight the traffic.
[00:37:54.276 --> 00:37:56.798]  And give people the gift of reality.
[00:37:56.798 --> 00:37:58.039]  The gift of understanding.
[00:37:58.039 --> 00:38:02.042]  These films are well produced, they have all the information in them, and
[00:38:02.842 --> 00:38:09.407]  So many listeners that call in, I'd say over 90%, got woken up by someone giving them a copy of one of my films.
[00:38:09.407 --> 00:38:10.888]  Please get them today.
[00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:13.809]  InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:38:13.809 --> 00:38:13.950]  888-253-3139.
[00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.711]  You can also write to me at P.O.
[00:38:15.711 --> 00:38:16.631]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:38:16.631 --> 00:38:18.993]  And your purchase, again, makes the entire transmission possible.
[00:38:33.022 --> 00:38:41.148]  All right, let's get into the next subject, and this is really, really important.
[00:38:41.148 --> 00:38:43.950]  I'm 36 years old.
[00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:53.777]  I learn more every single year than what I had learned in the previous decades.
[00:38:55.034 --> 00:38:58.175]  My understanding is accelerating and is expanding.
[00:38:58.175 --> 00:39:02.137]  You're not the only people who are learning.
[00:39:02.137 --> 00:39:06.019]  You're not the only people out there that are having epiphanies.
[00:39:06.019 --> 00:39:07.020]  I'm having them as well.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:19.946]  We're all learning together and doing many hours of radio every day and radio interviews and reading documents and reading legislation and truly immersing myself in this information for 17 years on air for 15.
[00:39:25.222 --> 00:39:28.743]  And before that, I was a big student of history because I found it to be entertaining.
[00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:38.646]  I mean, I liked Louis L'Amour novels when I was 12 years old, because my dad was reading them and reading science fiction, and I'd pick them up and read them.
[00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:43.588]  But as soon as I found history, I was done with fiction, because it was much more entertaining.
[00:39:43.588 --> 00:39:52.331]  And that's really how I got my education, my foundational understanding, because my parents read a lot of history as well, and those books were laying around the house.
[00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:59.779]  And we didn't have cable TV because my parents weren't big TV heads.
[00:39:59.779 --> 00:40:06.463]  And so I learned to read and entertain myself with reading instead of watching television.
[00:40:06.463 --> 00:40:09.325]  And I still watch some TV growing up, went to movies and things.
[00:40:09.325 --> 00:40:13.088]  It's just that, well, I love going to my neighbor's house because they would have cable.
[00:40:13.088 --> 00:40:15.629]  I didn't have it, so I didn't watch a lot of television.
[00:40:15.629 --> 00:40:21.353]  If I did, I watched mainly PBS and documentaries about war and history and Shakespearean plays and things.
[00:40:21.353 --> 00:40:23.074]  So I got a good base,
[00:40:25.576 --> 00:40:29.359]  Classical education from just studying history.
[00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:44.213]  Now, since then, interacting with the public, interacting with other media people, interacting with celebrities, I have gained a much greater understanding about human nature.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.162]  You know, I've been married for nine years.
[00:40:47.162 --> 00:40:48.784]  I've got three children.
[00:40:48.784 --> 00:40:51.987]  I've had all those experiences that other parents have had.
[00:40:51.987 --> 00:40:58.174]  I've had experiences now in business, and taxes, and how other people operate in business.
[00:40:58.174 --> 00:41:03.819]  And I've really learned how good humanity is, but also how bad humanity is.
[00:41:03.819 --> 00:41:06.962]  And I never really understood what good parents I had.
[00:41:07.623 --> 00:41:12.404]  I thought everybody had great, loving, strong, dedicated parents.
[00:41:12.404 --> 00:41:19.186]  I didn't realize how good my family was, how good my grandparents were on both sides.
[00:41:19.186 --> 00:41:26.848]  Real Christian families, you know, going back hundreds of years to the Mayflower and to Europe, I never realized how good I had it.
[00:41:26.848 --> 00:41:35.991]  And now I really feel sad for people who don't understand love, who don't understand honor, that don't understand strength, who don't understand decency.
[00:41:38.157 --> 00:41:39.441]  And it really makes me sad.
[00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:43.512]  And I realize that good people are blind to evil.
[00:41:44.304 --> 00:41:48.706]  I've never been perfect, and I've had my own dark side, but at least I could recognize it.
[00:41:48.706 --> 00:42:00.811]  A lot of people can't recognize it, and they're driven by envy, and by jealousy, and by hyper-competitiveness, and they're so unhappy, and they feel unfulfilled, and they're angry at others.
[00:42:00.811 --> 00:42:03.052]  They don't like seeing other people do well.
[00:42:03.052 --> 00:42:07.213]  They don't admire success that's been gained through hard work.
[00:42:07.213 --> 00:42:09.094]  They don't admire beauty.
[00:42:09.094 --> 00:42:12.996]  They don't admire power that's good and wholesome.
[00:42:14.113 --> 00:42:22.161]  And when you understand the globalist mindset, it's the ultimate expression of oppression.
[00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:29.728]  It's the ultimate expression of greediness and envy and control freakism.
[00:42:29.728 --> 00:42:31.310]  And now I understand a lot more.
[00:42:32.944 --> 00:42:34.884]  So many people I've tried to build up.
[00:42:34.884 --> 00:42:37.105]  So many people I've tried to lift up.
[00:42:37.105 --> 00:42:42.606]  So many people that I've seen that have been articulate and well-spoken and intelligent that I've tried to build up.
[00:42:42.606 --> 00:42:49.547]  I'd say over 80% of the time end up stabbing me in the back, lying about us, doing horrible things.
[00:42:49.547 --> 00:42:57.409]  And it's because they realize just how effective and far-reaching we are.
[00:42:57.409 --> 00:42:59.289]  I have always been humble.
[00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:04.654]  And in the last decade, I've really underestimated our reach.
[00:43:04.654 --> 00:43:10.197]  I've really tried to lie to myself because I don't want fame and fortune.
[00:43:10.197 --> 00:43:12.859]  It's one of the few things that I'm actually afraid of.
[00:43:12.859 --> 00:43:15.661]  I understand the dangers of it historically.
[00:43:15.661 --> 00:43:19.263]  I'm a humble person, a private person.
[00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:22.245]  And I've been public.
[00:43:22.245 --> 00:43:24.046]  I've been involved against tyranny.
[00:43:26.308 --> 00:43:31.910]  Because I want freedom for my family, and I want freedom for others, and I want others to not be under bondage.
[00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:37.712]  When I see someone else being oppressed, when I see someone else being abused, I empathize with them.
[00:43:37.712 --> 00:43:40.273]  I feel their pain, to use a Bill Clinton line.
[00:43:40.273 --> 00:43:48.756]  At a primitive level, I understand what's happening to other innocents will then end up happening to my family, and I'm threatened by it.
[00:43:50.674 --> 00:44:20.176]  But I have to tell you that I have not really announced to the listenership of this radio broadcast our analysis and our breakdown, and it's such a weight, of just how big this radio show is, just how big our films are, just how effective and trailblazing and exponentially viral InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are.
[00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:25.761]  It's indescribable.
[00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:52.880]  Everyone I talk to, family in other cities and other countries, people I've known over the years that work in television and in Hollywood, producers, directors, graphics people, you name it, they say now that not only are people talking about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, everyone I talk to in Hollywood, in government, in media, at Fox News, you name it, all tell me the same thing.
[00:44:54.788 --> 00:44:58.311]  All they're talking about is this show.
[00:44:58.311 --> 00:45:08.198]  Of course all the other so-called patriots are pulling their hair out in anger and jealousy and disgust because all they hear about is Alex Jones.
[00:45:08.198 --> 00:45:14.002]  All they hear about is InfoWars.com and they think that it's a detriment to them.
[00:45:14.002 --> 00:45:19.526]  They think it's somehow holding them back from some type of celebrity that they want.
[00:45:20.629 --> 00:45:24.492]  They haven't gotten celebrity because they weren't pure of heart.
[00:45:24.492 --> 00:45:26.794]  I don't want it, so I got it.
[00:45:26.794 --> 00:45:28.095]  I wanted to fight tyranny.
[00:45:29.278 --> 00:45:31.179]  I wanted to affect change.
[00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:38.241]  I wanted to stop the CPS taking over a million innocent children and abusing them and doing horrible things every year without due process.
[00:45:38.241 --> 00:45:42.803]  I want to stop people being brain damaged and killed from the next round of flu shots.
[00:45:42.803 --> 00:45:44.944]  I want to bring the Federal Reserve to justice.
[00:45:44.944 --> 00:45:47.004]  I want to stop these illegal wars.
[00:45:47.004 --> 00:45:51.486]  I got into this because they were trying to take our guns in Texas.
[00:45:51.486 --> 00:45:54.447]  I never intended to do what we've done together.
[00:45:57.571 --> 00:45:59.111]  We're all in great danger.
[00:45:59.111 --> 00:46:04.753]  We need to not let the COINTELPRO manipulators get us to infight with each other.
[00:46:04.753 --> 00:46:15.295]  We need to grow up and transcend this and all the people that are so incredibly jealous of me and the work we do here.
[00:46:15.295 --> 00:46:17.255]  It's so pointless.
[00:46:17.255 --> 00:46:21.036]  Don't they understand that even if they're just in this for the wrong reasons,
[00:46:22.284 --> 00:46:27.946]  That we are, if you look at it from a business perspective, building the market.
[00:46:27.946 --> 00:46:29.227]  We are waking people up.
[00:46:29.227 --> 00:46:31.008]  We are creating the liberty movement.
[00:46:31.008 --> 00:46:33.689]  Myself, my crew, and the listeners.
[00:46:33.689 --> 00:46:35.670]  That's our real power.
[00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:41.612]  Don't you understand that it's not a some set game?
[00:46:41.612 --> 00:46:46.334]  That we need to wake people up to the paradigm of liberty versus tyranny.
[00:46:46.334 --> 00:46:47.615]  And this is about survival.
[00:46:49.099 --> 00:47:01.129]  And that you look at it from a business perspective and that's not what it is, but even if you look at it from that perspective, we are building the entire market for you.
[00:47:01.129 --> 00:47:11.677]  Don't you understand that if I hadn't been here and done the things I've done and reached out to people, that you wouldn't have one-tenth of the viewers or listeners or readers that you have now?
[00:47:11.677 --> 00:47:15.300]  Most of these people admit that I woke them up or I inspired them.
[00:47:23.183 --> 00:47:25.246]  They still attack me.
[00:47:25.246 --> 00:47:28.531]  And they do it, and it doesn't hurt us, it actually only makes us bigger.
[00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:35.381]  But it actually taints the overall transmission that the Liberty Movement's sending out to make it all about Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:36.984]  That's destructive.
[00:47:36.984 --> 00:47:37.945]  This is serious.
[00:47:39.102 --> 00:47:52.693]  Even if I was the worst guy in the world, which isn't true, you should be spending your time warning people about the vaccines, about the fluoride, about the mercury, about the GMO, about the new wars that the system wants to push.
[00:47:52.693 --> 00:47:59.799]  We don't want the entire Liberty Movement to be about people defending Alex Jones or people attacking Alex Jones.
[00:47:59.799 --> 00:48:03.742]  At the end of the day, at a worldly level, it's good for me.
[00:48:03.742 --> 00:48:04.583]  Do you understand that?
[00:48:05.811 --> 00:48:07.612]  You know, what was the famous saying?
[00:48:07.612 --> 00:48:10.873]  I don't care what you say about me, just get my name spelled right.
[00:48:10.873 --> 00:48:18.437]  Well, yeah, if I was coming at this from a worldly perspective, I would be for what you're doing.
[00:48:18.437 --> 00:48:21.138]  But I'm not, because I want you to be more.
[00:48:21.138 --> 00:48:21.999]  I want to be more.
[00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:24.980]  I'm not perfect, but I want you to be pure of heart.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.941]  I want you to be strong.
[00:48:26.941 --> 00:48:28.102]  I want you to be winners.
[00:48:28.102 --> 00:48:29.222]  I want you to be effective.
[00:48:29.222 --> 00:48:32.684]  I don't want you to get manipulated by Hal Turner and hundreds of other operatives.
[00:48:34.969 --> 00:48:36.769]  I want you to be leaders.
[00:48:36.769 --> 00:48:39.770]  I want you to be what you really were born to be.
[00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:41.070]  Not a loser.
[00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:44.591]  Not a pathetic, jealous, envious person.
[00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:55.514]  You know, it was pointed out to me last night that Mr. Bellamy of Muse, one of the top three bands in the world right now, everything they put out comes out triple platinum.
[00:48:58.137 --> 00:49:01.018]  And the globalists are trying to co-op them right now.
[00:49:01.018 --> 00:49:26.046]  Mr. Bellamy's been on the show before, that on their main official site, they say website, websites that are the red pill, and the links on their official sites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and Propaganda Matrix, Paul Watson's mirror of Prison Planet.
[00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:26.626]  It's amazing.
[00:49:28.672 --> 00:49:31.574]  It's amazing.
[00:49:31.574 --> 00:49:35.636]  And I salute their music and their call to stand up against tyranny.
[00:49:35.636 --> 00:49:36.777]  It's powerful.
[00:49:36.777 --> 00:49:40.038]  I salute the Foo Fighters, who we know are patriots.
[00:49:40.038 --> 00:49:42.079]  I salute this indicator.
[00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:42.800]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.081]  A week and a half ago,
[00:49:46.038 --> 00:50:10.196]  Jesse Ventura, who I was instrumental in waking up to a great extent, he came to town to visit with me, as part of an investigation we're doing, and he said in the car, with Aaron and I riding around, going to a place we were investigating, he said, Alex, you know, I get a bigger response on your show than I get anywhere else, including Larry King Live.
[00:50:10.196 --> 00:50:10.917]  What does that say?
[00:50:12.037 --> 00:50:13.498]  It says we're effective.
[00:50:13.498 --> 00:50:20.340]  It says that we're bigger than when he goes on Good Morning America, Fox News, CNN.
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:26.683]  He gets a bigger response on the streets wherever he is in the world from this show.
[00:50:26.683 --> 00:50:29.284]  That tells you how important this broadcast is.
[00:50:29.284 --> 00:50:35.026]  And that tells you why the Southern Poverty Law Center put out three reports viciously attacking me last Friday.
[00:50:35.646 --> 00:50:41.071]  That tells you why the National News is attacking me and claiming I'm promoting cop killing when I'm doing the opposite.
[00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:44.555]  That tells you why they've got COINTELPRO at the grassroots attacking us.
[00:50:44.555 --> 00:50:48.679]  Because I'm the best thing going.
[00:50:48.679 --> 00:50:52.423]  And that is a humbling thing, because I'm human and aren't perfect.
[00:50:52.423 --> 00:50:53.584]  Far from it.
[00:50:53.584 --> 00:50:54.945]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:50:54.945 --> 00:50:58.649]  I'm now a Patriot Liberty Institution.
[00:50:58.649 --> 00:50:59.290]  You understand that?
[00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.071]  Attention!
[00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:06.075]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[00:51:06.075 --> 00:51:11.760]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:18.906]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[00:51:18.906 --> 00:51:27.693]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[00:51:28.874 --> 00:51:32.015]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[00:51:32.015 --> 00:51:38.857]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[00:51:38.857 --> 00:51:47.639]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[00:51:47.799 --> 00:51:52.487]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[00:51:52.487 --> 00:51:52.547]  800-902-6969.
[00:51:52.547 --> 00:51:52.647]  800-902-6969.
[00:51:52.647 --> 00:51:52.807]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[00:52:04.972 --> 00:52:06.233]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.233 --> 00:52:10.174]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:10.174 --> 00:52:12.395]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:18.258]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.258 --> 00:52:24.521]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:30.906]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.906 --> 00:52:35.090]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:39.374]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.374 --> 00:52:45.339]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.339 --> 00:52:48.882]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.882 --> 00:52:50.863]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.863 --> 00:52:51.304]  It's here.

[00:53:01.567 --> 00:53:03.587]  Remain in your houses.
[00:53:03.587 --> 00:53:07.428]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:10.711]  Will they do it?
[00:53:10.711 --> 00:53:13.335]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:13.335 --> 00:53:19.783]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:19.783 --> 00:53:21.986]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:21.986 --> 00:53:24.009]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:53:26.252 --> 00:53:31.134]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:31.134 --> 00:53:36.056]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:36.056 --> 00:53:40.878]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:53:41.798 --> 00:53:50.224]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:53:50.224 --> 00:53:52.726]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:53:52.726 --> 00:53:55.788]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[00:53:55.788 --> 00:54:05.254]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:54:05.254 --> 00:54:07.656]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:07.656 --> 00:54:10.378]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:54:13.968 --> 00:54:16.809]  Again, I don't like to talk about myself.
[00:54:16.809 --> 00:54:25.053]  The real power is about educating more Americans and people worldwide about the nature of global governance and the eugenics cult that controls it.
[00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:28.034]  It is a life and death situation.
[00:54:28.034 --> 00:54:33.277]  They're coming out with vaccines that literally attack your brain and reprogram it to where you can't get
[00:54:33.977 --> 00:54:34.817]  We're good to go.
[00:54:57.199 --> 00:55:07.108]  And so the main focus needs to be waking more people up and organizing the local governments and the counties and the states to say no to the New World Order.
[00:55:07.108 --> 00:55:10.591]  But dealing with the huge awakening on every front
[00:55:11.317 --> 00:55:19.042]  I mean, we put out special PrisonPlanet.tv videos every week that then get posted to YouTube, and on average they get about a half million views.
[00:55:19.042 --> 00:55:23.265]  We're getting over a million views on one YouTube channel a week, and it's growing.
[00:55:23.265 --> 00:55:24.746]  We have eight YouTube channels.
[00:55:24.746 --> 00:55:29.269]  There are hundreds of others, and hundreds of other websites carrying it, and video sites.
[00:55:29.269 --> 00:55:34.512]  We are reaching millions of new people every single week on the web alone.
[00:55:34.512 --> 00:55:38.915]  We reach tens of millions a week through the radio show, and through the interviews I do.
[00:55:39.455 --> 00:55:42.956]  And the message is strong, and it's scaring the establishment.
[00:55:42.956 --> 00:55:48.277]  Now there's a sophisticated article that covers a lot of facets that Paul Watson and I wrote this morning.
[00:55:48.277 --> 00:55:50.198]  He called me, said, what do you want me to do about this?
[00:55:50.198 --> 00:55:51.818]  I said, yes, I was aware of it.
[00:55:51.818 --> 00:55:53.498]  I'd forgotten to talk about it.
[00:55:53.498 --> 00:55:57.579]  I confirmed, because I do have the book, I haven't read it all, that this is what it deals with.
[00:55:57.579 --> 00:55:59.800]  And early on in the book,
[00:56:01.167 --> 00:56:14.315]  A patriot leader who has videos on YouTube and has an internet radio show gets a MIAC report from the police and exposes that the government is trying to destroy the country from within and staging terror attacks.
[00:56:14.315 --> 00:56:18.678]  Now remember, Beck attacks everybody that talks about government-sponsored terror.
[00:56:18.678 --> 00:56:27.684]  But he has the number one New York Times best-selling book, The Overton Window, where the hero of the book is Daniel Bailey.
[00:56:29.295 --> 00:56:35.540]  Who is a internet video person who gets the MIAC report from Missouri.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:41.185]  And he goes on to say this is really non-fiction wrapped in a fiction.
[00:56:41.185 --> 00:56:44.908]  And he coins a term to deal with that.
[00:56:44.908 --> 00:56:50.793]  And my issue here is I haven't talked about this because I don't want to reveal our sources.
[00:56:50.793 --> 00:56:55.878]  But I have two sources deep inside Fox News at the highest levels.
[00:56:58.154 --> 00:57:04.678]  And I have another source who talked about how Rick Perry privately at a meeting said, you don't need to go on his show.
[00:57:04.678 --> 00:57:09.561]  We're worried about him taking over the Republican Party, as if I'm going to take over the Republican Party.
[00:57:09.561 --> 00:57:12.863]  Well, they mean the ideas I'm putting out.
[00:57:12.863 --> 00:57:15.044]  And that's in Newsmax today.
[00:57:15.044 --> 00:57:21.088]  If true patriots can take over the Republican Party and the Democrats, there's no way the globalists can win.
[00:57:21.088 --> 00:57:24.610]  Real anti-incumbency is now happening.
[00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:25.991]  And that's my bottom line on Beck.
[00:57:27.099 --> 00:57:38.044]  What he's doing is, he's coming in as the counterfeit Alex Jones, and I have this from people in Fox News, he has five people who listen to the show every day.
[00:57:39.372 --> 00:57:40.553]  Track everything we do.
[00:57:40.553 --> 00:57:45.416]  That's why when you hear us with a guest, you hear it there two weeks later or a topic, but he puts a spin on it.
[00:57:45.416 --> 00:57:46.857]  And that's fine.
[00:57:46.857 --> 00:57:51.441]  But the problem is Beck has shown that he gets people's confidence and then dashes it.
[00:57:51.441 --> 00:57:52.581]  There are no FEMA camps.
[00:57:52.581 --> 00:57:55.183]  There's no government sponsored terror.
[00:57:55.183 --> 00:57:57.305]  You know, the Mike report's not that bad.
[00:57:57.305 --> 00:57:59.907]  But then he writes a book about government sponsored terror.
[00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:07.215]  In which I get killed stopping the government from detonating a hydrogen bomb in Los Angeles.
[00:58:07.215 --> 00:58:12.359]  There's a private global corporation, Bilderberg Group, manipulating things in the book.
[00:58:12.359 --> 00:58:16.802]  I'm going to finish up with this in the next segment, then we're going to go to Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:58:16.802 --> 00:58:19.304]  But the point is, well the article breaks it down.
[00:58:19.304 --> 00:58:23.207]  I'll try to read much of the article when we come back after the 72nd break.
[00:58:23.207 --> 00:58:26.010]  It's just that we are having a huge cultural effect
[00:58:26.912 --> 00:58:27.853]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:59:52.988 --> 00:59:55.370]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:58.152]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.966 --> 01:00:09.807]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:11.387]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.387 --> 01:00:12.948]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.948 --> 01:00:17.129]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.129 --> 01:00:23.090]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:29.151]  Webster Griffin Tarpley's coming up in the next segment to talk about the Iran situation, the economy, and a lot more.
[01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:31.512]  And later in the third hour, I'll talk more about this, but
[01:00:32.978 --> 01:00:35.200]  I've now had a chance to read part of it.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.001]  Watson scanned over it.
[01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:46.488]  We've confirmed his number one New York Times best-selling book, The Overton Window, is basically about yours truly.
[01:00:46.488 --> 01:00:48.329]  And it just details it all.
[01:00:48.329 --> 01:00:53.933]  Government-sponsored terror, world government, America destroyed by design.
[01:00:53.933 --> 01:00:54.974]  I've separately confirmed
[01:00:55.973 --> 01:01:04.785]  That top Fox News personalities have been told by Glenn Beck, do not go on Alex Jones' show.
[01:01:04.785 --> 01:01:06.487]  Same thing with Rick Perry.
[01:01:06.487 --> 01:01:08.109]  This is from two different people.
[01:01:09.318 --> 01:01:22.842]  And that they have a team of five people, they're listening right now, that listen and record every word I'm saying at Fox Center in New York, and they take everything I do and then twist it to be a Republicanoid version.
[01:01:22.842 --> 01:01:25.383]  See, I'm popular with the false left and the right.
[01:01:25.383 --> 01:01:27.004]  We're shattering those paradigms.
[01:01:27.004 --> 01:01:30.545]  And they claim they're doing some of that as they then re-invoke it.
[01:01:32.611 --> 01:01:35.093]  And so literally, Glenn Beck is the counterfeit.
[01:01:35.093 --> 01:01:37.494]  Now, I hope Glenn Beck's a good person deep down.
[01:01:37.494 --> 01:01:40.997]  He's a talented, smart guy, and I'm not even trying to attack him.
[01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:45.600]  But Paul Watson and I this morning put this article together.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.842]  It's very well written by Watson.
[01:01:48.842 --> 01:01:54.926]  We conferred while he was writing it over the phone, so it has his thoughts and my thoughts in it, but I concur with his views.
[01:01:54.926 --> 01:01:55.847]  And it's very important.
[01:01:55.847 --> 01:02:00.030]  It says, Glenn Beck channels Alex Jones in New York Times best-selling book.
[01:02:01.496 --> 01:02:16.279]  And he goes on to say, uh, one of the primary, uh, characters in Glenn Beck's New York Times bestseller novel, The Overton Window, is blatantly a caricature of our own Alex Jones, according to a reader, and we've also confirmed this, who sent us his book review.
[01:02:16.279 --> 01:02:21.221]  Jones is fictionalized as Daniel Bailey, and of course Beck is having all these ghosts written.
[01:02:21.221 --> 01:02:27.042]  I mean, you know, doing a radio show and TV show every day, uh, these are all, you know, a new book every six months, they're being ghostwritten.
[01:02:27.662 --> 01:02:31.107]  I mean, he's putting input into it, but it's got ghostwriters.
[01:02:31.107 --> 01:02:37.136]  According to a reader who sent us the review of the book, Jones is fictionalized as Daniel Bailey.
[01:02:37.136 --> 01:02:38.918]  I'm sure the ghostwriter's a fan.
[01:02:39.753 --> 01:02:41.754]  Because I mean, I'm in a great light in the book.
[01:02:41.754 --> 01:02:44.015]  The patriot movement leader who tries to prevent the U.S.
[01:02:44.015 --> 01:02:47.937]  government from carrying out false flag terror attacks on Los Angeles.
[01:02:47.937 --> 01:02:50.639]  Now, remember, Beck says none of this exists.
[01:02:50.639 --> 01:02:54.141]  And at the end of the book, he says, well, I said this really wasn't fiction.
[01:02:54.141 --> 01:02:57.683]  It was fiction, you know, covering up for real things.
[01:02:57.683 --> 01:03:01.305]  But there is no false flag terror and there are no FEMA camps.
[01:03:02.188 --> 01:03:06.272]  So Beck read it, what his ghostwriter wrote, and said, you better add this at the end.
[01:03:06.272 --> 01:03:12.999]  So they're going after our audience of awake people, but they're giving them a fictionalized version of it.
[01:03:12.999 --> 01:03:14.840]  Beck describes his book as a work of fiction.
[01:03:15.899 --> 01:03:18.261]  Faction, as he calls it.
[01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:24.665]  Fiction based on facts and accordingly many of the characters in the novel are people plucked from the real world with only their names changed.
[01:03:24.665 --> 01:03:32.470]  The novel's plot centers around an evil public relations firm that works with Homeland Security and the CIA to collapse America from within.
[01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:35.532]  Beck has put a book out about the truth, but it's fiction.
[01:03:35.532 --> 01:03:41.336]  An unprecedented attack, this is a quote, on US soil shakes the country to the core and puts in motion a frightening plan
[01:03:42.216 --> 01:04:08.400]  Decades in the making to transform America and demonize all those who stand in its way Amidst the chaos many don't know the difference between conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact are more important the side of the fight and which side they're fighting for States the amazon.com promo for the book the character of Daniel Bailey could merely be considered to be a construct of different people Alex Jones amongst them unless
[01:04:09.884 --> 01:04:19.750]  It was for a very specific detail contained in the plot that is a giveaway as of the fact that Beck based the character on Jones.
[01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:28.915]  The book begins, this is from Amazon, with a meeting between PR firm and members of Homeland Security trying to squash the leak of a MIAC report that we released.
[01:04:28.915 --> 01:04:31.737]  On record, major newspapers admit that.
[01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:36.520]  The PR firm boasts that they have successfully prevented the Washington Post from publishing the story.
[01:04:37.757 --> 01:04:49.106]  Unbeknownst to the PR firm, there is a patriot mole amongst them, and she leaks the MIAC report to Bailey, Alex Jones, and he exposes it widely, attended Patriot meeting.
[01:04:49.106 --> 01:04:59.914]  The MIAC report was a real document put out by the Missouri Information Analysis Center and Public Safety Partnership consisting of local, state, and federal agencies that characterize gun owners, Ron Paul supporters, libertarians, constitutionalists,
[01:04:59.974 --> 01:05:03.098]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:05:03.098 --> 01:05:06.902]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:09.785]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.

[01:07:03.871 --> 01:07:05.132]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:05.132 --> 01:07:09.013]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.013 --> 01:07:11.314]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:11.314 --> 01:07:17.156]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:17.156 --> 01:07:23.398]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:23.818 --> 01:07:29.800]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.981]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:33.981 --> 01:07:38.262]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:38.262 --> 01:07:44.224]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:44.224 --> 01:07:47.765]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:47.765 --> 01:07:49.746]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:49.746 --> 01:07:50.166]  It's here.

[01:08:07.253 --> 01:08:15.536]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.116 --> 01:08:23.340]  Just a few minutes, we're going to Webster Griffin Tarpley for the balance of the hour, historian and economist.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:30.985]  Talk about the situation with Iran, all the new developments on that front with the Knesset coming out this weekend and saying they are preparing to strike Iran.
[01:08:30.985 --> 01:08:36.389]  But finishing up with this article, Glenn Beck channels Alex Jones in New York Times bestselling book.
[01:08:36.389 --> 01:08:42.113]  We have the book, haven't finished it yet, but it's confirmed what the Amazon review and other reviews are saying.
[01:08:42.113 --> 01:08:46.636]  That's basically channeling yours truly with this Patriot
[01:08:47.376 --> 01:08:57.503]  YouTube host who gets the MIAC report and releases it to the public that patriots, conservatives, gun owners, returning veterans are being targeted by Homeland Security.
[01:08:57.503 --> 01:09:05.209]  There's a secret government plan to stage terror attacks, to set up a police state, and to economically implode the country by design.
[01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:13.235]  But then at the end of the book, which was clearly ghostwritten for Beck, he then goes on to say, oh, whereas I said this was faction,
[01:09:14.938 --> 01:09:17.660]  Non-fiction, hidden in fiction.
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:21.524]  Still, I don't believe in FEMA camps or the government staging terror.
[01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:26.048]  So we see the schizophrenia of Beck through this.
[01:09:26.048 --> 01:09:27.009]  It goes on.
[01:09:27.009 --> 01:09:31.493]  The Mike report was originally leaked to Alex Jones by an anonymous Missouri police officer.
[01:09:31.493 --> 01:09:34.695]  And the book mirrors that, just changes my name to Bailey.
[01:09:35.589 --> 01:09:42.837]  Alex Jones was the source of the story, after he had obtained the document from a whistleblower, mirroring almost precisely the plot in Beck's book.
[01:09:42.837 --> 01:09:52.787]  This allied with almost every other fact and facet of the character's involvement in the story, including the fact that Bailey is depicted as the father of the Radical Patriot Movement.
[01:09:53.308 --> 01:09:59.850]  While a wide following of his videos on the internet strongly indicates that Daniel Bailey is none other than Alex Jones.
[01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:14.774]  According to Clarkson, the Patriot movement along with Daniel Bailey are portrayed by Beck in a positive light throughout the book, and indeed Bailey becomes the hero of the story when he sacrifices himself to prevent the government from setting off a nuclear device in Los Angeles by detonating the bomb in the desert.
[01:10:14.774 --> 01:10:18.855]  So is Beck trying to wink-wink tell people he's really a Patriot and is for real?
[01:10:20.029 --> 01:10:26.413]  This also borrows heavily from a plot focused around the character of Jack Bauer in the TV drama series 24.
[01:10:26.413 --> 01:10:38.059]  However, perhaps the biggest twist contained in the book does not occur during the course of the actual story itself, but is an afterword in which Beck completely distances himself from the notion that any of the material is accurate.
[01:10:38.059 --> 01:10:45.223]  But at the first of the book, he says it's faction, which is real fiction, despite him describing the book as a work of faction.
[01:10:46.741 --> 01:10:55.505]  In the afterword of the book, he makes a feeble attempt to discredit some of the damning info in the book, like 7-7 being staged, and the drill they were running that day.
[01:10:55.505 --> 01:10:58.447]  He dismisses the 7-7 war games as a coincidence.
[01:10:58.447 --> 01:11:10.333]  He also dismisses the Army's advertisement for internment and resettlement specialists by citing our armed forces' mission of bringing democracy to foreign lands, but they admit it's also for domestic, such as Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:14.695]  He dismisses the fact that such policies will be used here and in our homeland.
[01:11:15.515 --> 01:11:17.057]  Continuing and we're going to Tarpley.
[01:11:17.057 --> 01:11:23.006]  So why does it matter that a caricature of Alex Jones is one of the many players in Glenn Beck's new book?
[01:11:23.006 --> 01:11:27.252]  Primarily it goes to show that Alex and his message via your activism
[01:11:28.334 --> 01:11:31.697]  is now firmly woven in the fabric of American political discourse.
[01:11:31.697 --> 01:11:39.323]  Beck has an audience of millions and wields a significant, albeit somewhat declining, influence on the body politics, according to his ratings numbers.
[01:11:39.323 --> 01:11:53.094]  Secondarily, it again highlights the baffling disconnect between Beck's own accurate and compelling message that a new world order is trying to destroy America from within, and his contradictory debunking of the issues that form that assessment.
[01:11:53.094 --> 01:11:57.398]  FEMA camps, false flag terror, and a multitude of other facets of the new world order agenda.
[01:11:58.018 --> 01:12:05.204]  Is Beck a genuinely concerned patriot who is just afraid of losing his media platform if he goes all the way?
[01:12:05.204 --> 01:12:12.690]  Is he merely an opportunist out to make money from paranoia and the obvious and real collapse of America?
[01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:19.155]  Or is he a Pied Piper gaining trust from the patriot movement by putting out a good message only to later lead them astray?
[01:12:20.066 --> 01:12:31.350]  We have been told by several highly placed and credible sources at Fox News that Beck has a team of researchers whose primary role is to listen to Alex and read Alex's material from his radio shows and websites.
[01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:44.055]  This obviously suggests that Beck and Fox News are obsessed with Jones' material because they are trying to gain the trust of Jones' growing audience in an effort to exalt Beck as a Jones counterfeit and misdirect the Patriot movement.
[01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:52.509]  The fact that Beck is constantly attacked by the establishment left only increases his credibility amongst conservatives.
[01:12:52.509 --> 01:12:57.095]  Just like right-wing attacks on Obama is the only thing that bolsters him.
[01:12:57.095 --> 01:12:57.596]  Continuing...
[01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:09.166]  As the economy goes into meltdown, Americans are waking up to the New World Order agenda in droves, thanks in part to Alex Jones and the work of his Infowarriors worldwide.
[01:13:09.166 --> 01:13:15.130]  The only way Glenn Beck can stay relevant is to identify with these people by mixing in some truth with his message.
[01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:25.997]  Beck puts out the information in a fictional context and then adds a disclaimer at the end in order to psychologically inoculate people against the fact that everything he talks about in the book is really happening.
[01:13:25.997 --> 01:13:27.658]  This revelation of the method technique
[01:13:28.078 --> 01:13:29.218]  We all choose sides in life.
[01:13:29.218 --> 01:13:29.758]  This is the key.
[01:13:29.758 --> 01:13:31.299]  We all choose sides in life and whatever
[01:13:58.203 --> 01:14:00.524]  The truth really is surrounding Beck's motivations.
[01:14:00.524 --> 01:14:04.805]  We hope for his sake that he has chosen the right side.
[01:14:04.805 --> 01:14:11.066]  And then we have a review, another review of the book by someone else underneath that.
[01:14:11.066 --> 01:14:12.927]  We appreciate them giving us that tip.
[01:14:12.927 --> 01:14:24.750]  I got the book in a bookstore a few weeks ago and hadn't, I've scanned over it and seen what you're talking about and just couldn't believe it and threw it on the desk at my house and never really got into it on air.
[01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:25.610]  It's just too bizarre.
[01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:28.991]  But we're seeing this everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:39.634]  And before we get into Iran, before we get into the economy of Webster Tarpley, I want to get his view on the article I just read and why he thinks Glenn Beck is doing this.
[01:14:39.634 --> 01:14:40.815]  What do you think's going on, Webster?
[01:14:41.656 --> 01:14:50.858]  Well Alex, I haven't really seen this article that you're talking about, but I can tell you a few things about Glenn Beck in general, and maybe draw some historical parallels.
[01:14:50.858 --> 01:15:02.661]  I think the most important thing you have to say about Glenn Beck is that he's a scoundrel, and I don't normally start off with insults, but that's... If you don't establish the fact that he's an unprincipled scoundrel,
[01:15:03.864 --> 01:15:09.629]  Uh, and, uh, really, this is really deplorable what this guy does on television.
[01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:12.691]  He's obviously a creature of Rupert Murdoch.
[01:15:12.691 --> 01:15:25.260]  In other words, this reactionary, uh, quasi-fascist Australian millionaire who's taken over this, you know, Fox News empire, and his friend there, Roger Ailes, who has credentials going back to the
[01:15:26.213 --> 01:15:32.318]  The Nixon campaign and even to the campaigns of Bush the Elder in Texas and elsewhere.
[01:15:32.318 --> 01:15:35.841]  They're the ones who put Glenn Beck on the air.
[01:15:36.545 --> 01:15:40.227]  Now, if you go back to the 1930s, you had similar figures, right?
[01:15:40.227 --> 01:15:49.934]  You had this guy, Father Coghlan, the radio priest, and the message from Father Coghlan, the radio priest, was that basically Hitler was not as bad as you thought.
[01:15:49.934 --> 01:15:51.815]  Hitler was really a good guy.
[01:15:51.815 --> 01:15:56.878]  The main enemy was Stalin, so he had a whole demagogic thing around this.
[01:15:58.079 --> 01:15:59.940]  Glenn Beck is an eclectic.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:06.983]  In other words, what he's looking for is what I would call a demagogic synthesis of a whole bunch of elements.
[01:16:06.983 --> 01:16:12.345]  And you're very right to say, in my terminology, his job is to co-opt.
[01:16:12.345 --> 01:16:19.148]  In other words, he's got to take forms of political ferment, you know, people in motion, people who are upset about Obama.
[01:16:19.688 --> 01:16:23.232]  He's got to convoy them back, ultimately, to the Republican Party.
[01:16:23.232 --> 01:16:24.593]  That's his task.
[01:16:24.593 --> 01:16:26.095]  He's got to co-opt them.
[01:16:26.095 --> 01:16:27.196]  He's got to dupe them.
[01:16:27.196 --> 01:16:28.957]  He's got to manipulate them.
[01:16:28.957 --> 01:16:37.286]  And then you look at what he offers, this whole format with the chalkboard and the professorial lecture and all these things.
[01:16:37.286 --> 01:16:39.268]  The guy is profoundly ignorant.
[01:16:39.268 --> 01:16:40.769]  He doesn't know anything.
[01:16:40.769 --> 01:16:42.291]  He's basically an alcoholic.
[01:16:42.771 --> 01:16:44.972]  With intellectual pretension, right?
[01:16:44.972 --> 01:16:47.854]  A dry drunk, in many ways similar to Bush the Younger.
[01:16:47.854 --> 01:16:49.975]  Same kind of personality.
[01:16:49.975 --> 01:16:51.336]  He's obviously a narcissist.
[01:16:51.336 --> 01:16:54.838]  He's got a lot in common with Obama from that point of view.
[01:16:54.838 --> 01:16:58.920]  But it's interesting that somebody in this kind of a slot, right?
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.401]  Daytime television, 4 or 5 o'clock.
[01:17:01.361 --> 01:17:12.226]  Would normally not be offering you opinions about Woodrow Wilson, or William McKinley, or... They had a program lately in praise of Calvin Coolidge, of all people.
[01:17:12.226 --> 01:17:19.749]  With an activist from the Council on Foreign Relations, this Calamity Slays, was there to tell you how great Calvin Coolidge was.
[01:17:19.749 --> 01:17:29.973]  Normally these are topics that you don't get on daytime television, but he feels the need to go into this, and you see that this is a departure from normal American politics.
[01:17:30.213 --> 01:17:43.663]  Just because the internet and this show is raising all of these real issues and putting it in a proper historical perspective and so they're now forced to basically cover this and they're getting top ratings by doing it.
[01:17:43.663 --> 01:17:46.886]  So, I mean, bottom line, Rupert Murdoch wants to steer and control this.
[01:17:46.886 --> 01:17:50.168]  He sees it as a lucrative market.
[01:17:50.168 --> 01:17:57.154]  But, I mean, to have Beck write a book about false flag terror, 7-7 being staged, the MIAC report, an Alex Jones character.
[01:17:58.134 --> 01:18:04.379]  And then to say none of this is real at the end, but to say it's real at the first, very bizarre.
[01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:07.561]  I think it's simply designed to confuse people.
[01:18:07.561 --> 01:18:15.427]  It's to make people think that they've learned something when, again, I haven't read this book and I don't know the article you're referring to, to confuse them.
[01:18:15.427 --> 01:18:18.709]  Hey, listen, Alex, I have some stuff going on with me too.
[01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:25.394]  If you listen to Rush Limbaugh these days, he says, regime, regime, regime, the Obama regime, the Obama regime.
[01:18:25.854 --> 01:18:29.156]  This is more or less the language I've been using for three or four years.
[01:18:29.156 --> 01:18:34.440]  And today I heard Limbaugh came out with one of my signature terms, which is reactionary.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.162]  This is something you don't usually hear in the United States.
[01:18:38.162 --> 01:18:40.784]  Normally these people, they call themselves conservatives.
[01:18:40.784 --> 01:18:42.765]  They're not conservatives, they're reactionaries.
[01:18:42.765 --> 01:18:43.986]  That would be Glenn Beck.
[01:18:43.986 --> 01:18:47.469]  But Limbaugh says there are reactionary leftists.
[01:18:47.469 --> 01:18:49.290]  So leftist reactionaries running around.
[01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:50.531]  It's very interesting.
[01:18:50.531 --> 01:18:52.592]  He takes kind of a trope, right?
[01:18:52.592 --> 01:18:55.314]  He takes an element of rhetoric and he
[01:18:57.975 --> 01:19:06.277]  No, we know Limbaugh uses PrisonPlanet.com articles all the time and now the Drudge Report is linking to our Dr. Paul Craig Roberts articles.
[01:19:06.277 --> 01:19:20.702]  I mean, it's just our information is everywhere and so the system is trying to gauge it and trying to color themselves like us, camouflage themselves so they can pose as anti-establishment to keep the power structure in power.
[01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:27.166]  Right, and this is really dangerous demagogy because, again, you can't get around looking at somebody like Mussolini or Hitler.
[01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:35.130]  If we just take Mussolini, the fascist movement at the beginning was considered to be radical leftist in many ways, right?
[01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:46.056]  They had socialists in there, they had very militant trade unionists, then they had war veterans, they had intellectuals, and you have to bring them together around this kind of stew, right?
[01:19:46.056 --> 01:19:47.357]  This salad of different
[01:19:47.857 --> 01:19:50.918]  Pieces of analysis drawn from here, there, and everywhere.
[01:19:50.918 --> 01:19:52.379]  Stay there, Tarpley.
[01:19:52.379 --> 01:19:53.279]  We got a break.
[01:19:53.279 --> 01:20:00.002]  This is how they bind all the groups together and they've got anti-establishment leftists when Bush was in power posing as patriots.
[01:20:00.002 --> 01:20:00.362]  We'll be back.
[01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:05.265]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:24:05.777 --> 01:24:07.999]  Everything is divide and conquer.
[01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:18.767]  Coming up in the next hour, there's a key article that Matt Ryan's written that just went up at Infowars.com, where a black construction worker wasn't even a Muslim.
[01:24:18.767 --> 01:24:22.870]  He was working at Ground Zero, and this crowd saw him and chased him, screaming, get out of here, Muslim!
[01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:24.452]  He's like, I'm not a Muslim!
[01:24:24.452 --> 01:24:32.017]  He was even wearing an American flag, and they chased him, getting very close to something out of Nazi Germany, where they first wouldn't let Jews have businesses and would
[01:24:33.058 --> 01:24:34.999]  Chase them off the streets.
[01:24:34.999 --> 01:24:39.261]  And they're hyping all this up now, right at the time.
[01:24:39.261 --> 01:24:49.326]  Oh, Matt Ryan, add to your story Steve Watson's article about Muslim imam is globalist stooge, trilateral commission, CFR, top globalist.
[01:24:49.326 --> 01:24:56.710]  It turns out the co-owner of Fox News, this is Associated Press, and Yahoo is, this is so incredible.
[01:24:57.410 --> 01:25:08.996]  Is actually the main contributor to the mosque and now some black guy wearing an American flag shirt comes walking out of Ground Zero where he's working and they see him and start chasing him around.
[01:25:08.996 --> 01:25:11.597]  I mean this is incredible what they're doing.
[01:25:11.597 --> 01:25:17.520]  Webster, I want to get into Iran but clearly this builds up towards that hysteria.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.963]  We've got this key article by Steve Watson that I covered some Friday and Sunday.
[01:25:21.963 --> 01:25:22.923]  Guys, reprint that for me.
[01:25:22.923 --> 01:25:23.884]  I know it's in the stack but
[01:25:25.024 --> 01:25:30.485]  Even more directly, this is a Imam Faisal Rauf, and it turns out that he's from the FBI.
[01:25:30.485 --> 01:25:33.706]  He works for the FBI, he's a trainer for the FBI, he's an advisor for the FBI.
[01:25:47.089 --> 01:25:49.991]  He has worked for Bush the Younger in that administration.
[01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:52.152]  He's a current employee of the State Department.
[01:25:52.152 --> 01:25:56.575]  Now, this is what we would call, in very poor terms, a government agent.
[01:25:56.575 --> 01:26:01.458]  And he's out there as an FBI provocateur doing his job, which is to provoke.
[01:26:01.458 --> 01:26:13.506]  And now, instead of having, we could have about 95% of this population marching against Wall Street and saying, down with the banks, claw back the bailouts, you know, stop, you know, lower the credit card rates.
[01:26:14.226 --> 01:26:15.927]  Uh, no more payday loans.
[01:26:15.927 --> 01:26:18.628]  You could get about 95% of the American people for that.
[01:26:18.628 --> 01:26:22.310]  Instead, we've got these, you know, 60, 40, 70, 30 things.
[01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:23.850]  We've got the New York mosque.
[01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:27.312]  We've got the Arizona, uh, illegal alien situation.
[01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:34.014]  And of course, gay marriage in California coming right on the heels of the Shirley Sherrod doctor, uh, tape.
[01:26:34.014 --> 01:26:35.215]  So what does this mean?
[01:26:35.215 --> 01:26:42.578]  That no serious economic issue, none of the life or death economic questions of jobs, uh, employment, wages,
[01:26:43.218 --> 01:26:45.860]  Uh, the thing is that people really live or die by.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.541]  That is all swept aside.
[01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:50.864]  So we're having a summer of total programmed insanity, right?
[01:26:50.864 --> 01:26:55.127]  Of MKUltra running wild, if you will, through all the mass media.
[01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:58.910]  And I urge people, when you see a dog and pony show like this,
[01:26:59.290 --> 01:27:02.173]  Have the brains not to choose sides.
[01:27:02.173 --> 01:27:12.183]  You know, when you see the Yankees playing the other team in the World Series, it's hard not to get sucked in.
[01:27:12.183 --> 01:27:15.006]  You want to choose sides and become a fan for one side.
[01:27:15.006 --> 01:27:19.851]  In this case, don't do it because this is simply a way to prepare these elections.
[01:27:19.851 --> 01:27:20.712]  I think it shows that
[01:27:21.232 --> 01:27:31.098]  The ruling elite is in the process of switching their bets from the sinking ship of Obama to some demagogic reactionary Republican.
[01:27:31.098 --> 01:27:42.365]  Maybe it's Mitt Romney, but I think much more likely General Petraeus waiting in the wings as the new version of, you know, whatever oppression is coming down.
[01:27:42.365 --> 01:27:45.166]  And notice we now have the ADL saying no to the mosque.
[01:27:45.166 --> 01:27:48.168]  I mean, this is like right out of Nazi Germany what they're doing.
[01:27:48.328 --> 01:27:53.350]  Yeah, the thing with the mosque is obviously, if you want to make a gesture of reconciliation, that's a wonderful thing.
[01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:57.331]  But unfortunately, this is not turning out to be a gesture of reconciliation.
[01:27:57.331 --> 01:28:00.932]  So I would think that it's time, really, to de-emphasize this.
[01:28:00.932 --> 01:28:05.113]  Plus, everybody's arguing about something that, strictly speaking, doesn't exist.
[01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:06.734]  There is no mosque.
[01:28:06.734 --> 01:28:07.914]  There really is.
[01:28:07.914 --> 01:28:10.295]  Even one more building has to be bought.
[01:28:10.515 --> 01:28:22.998]  Well, it's a First Amendment issue, and it's a property right issue, and the fact that this guy's hooked in with the FBI, State Department, Trilateral Commission, CFR, and being funded by the owner of Fox News, I mean, that's incredible!
[01:28:22.998 --> 01:28:25.319]  Yeah, but again, it doesn't exist.
[01:28:25.319 --> 01:28:26.959]  They don't have the money to do this.
[01:28:26.959 --> 01:28:30.140]  They have to buy another piece of property, then they have to build it.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:33.381]  This thing is years and years in the future, if at all.
[01:28:33.381 --> 01:28:37.942]  It's a perfect psychological distraction to create the primitive...
[01:28:40.143 --> 01:28:51.011]  You know, animal brainstem threat that, oh my gosh, the foreigners that did 9-11, they've now come to plant their flag at ground zero.
[01:28:51.011 --> 01:28:56.455]  It's a propaganda image like Iwo Jima with the troops raising the flag.
[01:28:56.455 --> 01:28:57.936]  It's that snapshot image.
[01:28:58.476 --> 01:28:59.237]  Something like that.
[01:28:59.237 --> 01:29:02.220]  And remember, these are the wedge issues, right?
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.805]  The hot-button social issues that pit one significant part of the U.S.
[01:29:06.805 --> 01:29:08.747]  population against another part, right?
[01:29:08.747 --> 01:29:18.037]  The gays against the straights, the Islamic population against the rest of them, or the leftists joining in on the side of the mosque.
[01:29:18.617 --> 01:29:19.778]  And so on and so on.
[01:29:19.778 --> 01:29:21.099]  It never ends, right?
[01:29:21.099 --> 01:29:31.707]  The nativists against the Hispanic immigrants and Wall Street laughs all the way to the bank because no attacks on Wall Street have been heard for the last 30 or 60 days.
[01:29:31.707 --> 01:29:32.467]  Alright, stay there.
[01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:34.269]  I want to come back and get into Iran, Webster.
[01:29:34.269 --> 01:29:34.989]  That's why you're here.
[01:29:34.989 --> 01:29:36.570]  And then the economy.
[01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:38.251]  Where you see this going.
[01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:41.814]  The Knesset coming out over the weekend and saying they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[01:29:41.814 --> 01:29:42.595]  It's all coming up.
[01:29:42.595 --> 01:29:43.275]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:43.275 --> 01:29:46.497]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:46.497 --> 01:29:47.118]  Please stay with us.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.602]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.602 --> 01:30:00.025]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.025 --> 01:30:04.228]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:04.228 --> 01:30:10.632]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:10.632 --> 01:30:14.974]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much
[01:30:14.974 --> 01:30:17.997]  Of course they love these products for bath, hair, laundry and dishes.
[01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:22.882]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:30:22.882 --> 01:30:31.551]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:35.295]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:42.567]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:30:42.567 --> 01:30:46.448]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:30:46.448 --> 01:30:52.549]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:30:52.549 --> 01:30:52.969]  Thank you.
[01:31:01.584 --> 01:31:05.547]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:05.547 --> 01:31:14.414]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:14.414 --> 01:31:19.038]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.038 --> 01:31:29.867]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:30.487 --> 01:31:39.989]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:39.989 --> 01:31:45.411]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:45.411 --> 01:31:52.912]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:52.912 --> 01:31:55.653]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:31:59.465 --> 01:32:04.008]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.008 --> 01:32:04.929]  Number 1.
[01:32:04.929 --> 01:32:08.351]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:09.212]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.212 --> 01:32:14.095]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:14.835]  It's true.
[01:32:14.835 --> 01:32:19.719]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.719 --> 01:32:20.539]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.539 --> 01:32:24.121]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.121 --> 01:32:27.824]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.024 --> 01:32:31.585]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.585 --> 01:32:35.267]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.267 --> 01:32:40.209]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.209 --> 01:32:45.251]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.251 --> 01:32:49.432]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.432 --> 01:32:51.213]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.213 --> 01:32:56.035]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call one
[01:32:56.135 --> 01:33:04.666]  877-327-0365.
[01:33:04.666 --> 01:33:10.693]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:10.693 --> 01:33:13.236]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:26.848]  Okay, we're going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley in just a moment.
[01:33:26.848 --> 01:33:30.376]  There is no doubt that the system is now in full gear.
[01:33:31.482 --> 01:33:36.564]  To promote an attack on Iran, they fueled the Bashir Peaceful Reactor.
[01:33:36.564 --> 01:33:39.625]  It would take them five years, according to the U.N.
[01:33:39.625 --> 01:33:43.786]  itself, to get enough uranium out of these rods to build a weapon.
[01:33:43.786 --> 01:33:52.729]  But under contract, the Russians are running the facility and are going to take those spent fuel rods and the waste from the plant away.
[01:33:52.729 --> 01:33:54.669]  The Iranians last week offered the U.S.
[01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:56.590]  to come build it and run it.
[01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:59.011]  They offered for Turkey and Brazil to do it.
[01:33:59.711 --> 01:34:09.521]  It's all coming up because now Israeli Knesset member declares we are preparing for war and we're seeing similar statements out of one of the globalist favorite organs.
[01:34:09.521 --> 01:34:15.667]  It came out last week in declassified Senate documents that one of the main newspapers, magazines, paid off
[01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:29.979]  Illegally by the Israelis, paid cash, was Atlantic Monthly decades ago, and it's now Atlantic Monthly again putting out the latest, you know, why Israel's preparing to attack Iran and what it means to you.
[01:34:29.979 --> 01:34:32.961]  So that's coming up with Webster here in just a moment.
[01:34:32.961 --> 01:34:39.866]  Before we go any further, I want to tell you about efoodsdirect.com, the highest quality storable foods out there.
[01:34:39.866 --> 01:34:41.648]  This is where I get my storable foods.
[01:34:41.648 --> 01:34:43.049]  It's all fresh made.
[01:34:43.854 --> 01:34:44.014]  Yeah.
[01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:09.451]  Everything detailed on it.
[01:35:09.451 --> 01:35:12.832]  efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:15.673]  That's efoodsdirect.com.
[01:35:15.673 --> 01:35:17.113]  Don't be dependent on the system.
[01:35:17.113 --> 01:35:22.455]  Get prepared now as we go into World War III and the Depression and everything else.
[01:35:22.455 --> 01:35:25.016]  Let's hope for the best, but prepare for the worst, as they've said.
[01:35:25.016 --> 01:35:29.038]  And continuing along that line, mysolarbackup.com.
[01:35:29.038 --> 01:35:32.019]  Have you lost your power and want to simply flip a switch on to get the lights back on?

[01:36:14.427 --> 01:36:16.868]  One word, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:36:16.868 --> 01:36:20.689]  Okay, powerfully, I'm going to try to shut up now and give you the floor.
[01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:33.172]  Who the interests are, you know, this new fake Iraq pulldown where they admit they've just renamed the names of the battle brigades, increased the private security firms in a model of control they want in the U.S.
[01:36:33.172 --> 01:36:35.693]  with a top-secret USA system.
[01:36:35.693 --> 01:36:39.914]  We've got them building towards an Iran strike, saying they've got to do it.
[01:36:39.914 --> 01:36:42.795]  They said two weeks ago, or a week and a half ago, they had to hit Iran.
[01:36:43.175 --> 01:36:49.501]  Before they fuel the reactor, because if they hit it once the rods are in, it could cause a Chernobyl.
[01:36:49.501 --> 01:36:53.144]  All of this on the heels of toxic legacy of U.S.
[01:36:53.144 --> 01:36:56.227]  assault on Fallujah, worse than Hiroshima.
[01:36:56.227 --> 01:37:02.392]  Top scientists admit off the charts increases of deformities and deaths from the DUUs in Fallujah.
[01:37:02.392 --> 01:37:07.217]  Our troops that rolled in after the assault, they're dying and having massive health problems.
[01:37:07.717 --> 01:37:11.038]  Now this is just incredible and now they want a whole new war.
[01:37:11.038 --> 01:37:16.139]  So Webster, break it all down for us and where your intel and research shows we're going.
[01:37:16.139 --> 01:37:23.621]  Well I guess first of all that we've now got the third anniversary of the Rogue B-52.
[01:37:23.621 --> 01:37:30.983]  Remember this, a Rogue B-52 strategic bomber with six nuclear-armed cruise missiles was essentially hijacked
[01:37:31.563 --> 01:37:34.685]  By the Cheney faction, this rogue network.
[01:37:34.685 --> 01:37:35.725]  Again, it's not the U.S.
[01:37:35.725 --> 01:37:36.125]  government.
[01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:37.626]  It's out of the control of the U.S.
[01:37:37.626 --> 01:37:45.110]  government and into a Wall Street-controlled network, the one that Cheney happened to be the spokesman for there for a while.
[01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:47.772]  Cheney may be gone, but this thing goes on and on.
[01:37:47.772 --> 01:37:52.234]  And you remember, it went from North Dakota to Louisiana, and then it was going to go on to the Middle East.
[01:37:53.074 --> 01:38:00.981]  This was right before the September 7th Israeli air raid on Syria, which, according to the Israelis, at least destroyed a nuclear reactor.
[01:38:00.981 --> 01:38:04.444]  I'm still skeptical about that, but you've got to think about this.
[01:38:04.444 --> 01:38:10.289]  The rogue B-52, and there never was a congressional investigation, there's never been an accounting about this.
[01:38:10.849 --> 01:38:22.994]  It was never an issue in the presidential election and I had called attention to this actually before the fact with that Kenny Bunkport warning which was issued about three years ago this month.
[01:38:22.994 --> 01:38:25.955]  So that was the last time we were on the brink of war.
[01:38:25.955 --> 01:38:31.997]  After that we had the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate which said, and this is the CIA,
[01:38:32.897 --> 01:38:39.081]  We state with great confidence that Iran has no nuclear weapons program.
[01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:42.523]  They had one up until 2003, but not anymore.
[01:38:42.523 --> 01:38:51.849]  Now, all of that has changed, and I would point to, in particular, the increased financial desperation of London and New York, right?
[01:38:51.849 --> 01:38:54.851]  They had been attempting now for the last year or so
[01:38:55.655 --> 01:38:58.096]  To stage a speculative attack on the Euro.
[01:38:58.096 --> 01:39:04.879]  They were attacking through the Greek bonds, the Spanish, Portuguese, and other government bonds.
[01:39:04.879 --> 01:39:09.340]  And they got a significant crisis going on that in April and May.
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:13.222]  But then, that attack has now broken down.
[01:39:13.222 --> 01:39:16.663]  Partly because of the German self-defense measures, right?
[01:39:16.663 --> 01:39:20.985]  Germany came forward and said, we're banning naked credit default swaps.
[01:39:20.985 --> 01:39:23.866]  We're banning naked shorts against German stocks.
[01:39:24.646 --> 01:39:28.288]  And I think very important, China supported the Euro.
[01:39:28.288 --> 01:39:31.429]  The Chinese were not prepared to see the U.S.
[01:39:31.429 --> 01:39:33.150]  and the British destroy the Euro.
[01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:39.473]  So China came in and began buying up Eurozone assets and that had the effect of supporting the Euro.
[01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:46.496]  So what we've had is an attempted blitzkrieg by the Anglo-Americans against the Euro, which has now broken down.
[01:39:46.496 --> 01:39:49.597]  The high point of this was around the flash crash.
[01:39:49.597 --> 01:39:51.358]  Remember the May 6th event?
[01:39:51.878 --> 01:39:56.041]  When the Dow lost 1,000 points in about 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:39:56.041 --> 01:40:07.928]  Take a look at that because if you look at what was happening in the currency world on the afternoon of the flash crash, you'll see that the Euro lost about 12 American cents compared to a Yen.
[01:40:08.852 --> 01:40:11.513]  And that's a big dip.
[01:40:11.513 --> 01:40:22.418]  It looks to me like the flash crash had something to do with a program trading, high-frequency trading attack on the euro, but somehow boomerang.
[01:40:22.418 --> 01:40:24.899]  They found that they were successfully driving down the euro.
[01:40:25.439 --> 01:40:31.624]  But it was also destroying the New York Stock Market, so they had to pull back as this thing exploded in their face.
[01:40:31.624 --> 01:40:41.252]  So now, it's essentially the blitzkrieg by the Anglo-Americans has failed, and really for the last three months everything has been drifting sideways.
[01:40:41.252 --> 01:40:48.738]  There's a possibility that it may now be the pound and the dollar that go down, and the euro survives.
[01:40:48.738 --> 01:40:53.422]  There's certain strength in the euro that has been displayed over the last nine, ten weeks.
[01:40:55.323 --> 01:40:58.126]  But it's also possible that the Yen will be the big winner.
[01:40:58.126 --> 01:41:09.736]  We may wake up one morning and find that the Yen and the Chinese Renminbi are standing, and that the Dollar and the Euro have been locked in this conflict, and they both go down together.
[01:41:09.736 --> 01:41:12.098]  Probably together with the Pound, anyway.
[01:41:12.658 --> 01:41:19.240]  Apart from the details, this is the kind of situation that drives a financier ruling class absolutely berserk.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:20.201]  They go bonkers.
[01:41:20.201 --> 01:41:21.401]  They freak out.
[01:41:21.401 --> 01:41:23.762]  They go into these flight-forward things.
[01:41:23.762 --> 01:41:31.164]  And the idea is, of course, if you could start a war in the Middle East, you can get the Iranians to block the Straits of Hormuz and the Gulf.
[01:41:31.164 --> 01:41:34.945]  And at that point, the price of oil goes to $300 or $500 a barrel or even higher.
[01:41:37.206 --> 01:41:43.388]  And at that point, the problem of the dollar for the moment is solved because there's huge demand for dollars.
[01:41:43.388 --> 01:41:53.952]  If you multiply the price of oil by 5 or 10, then you've multiplied demand for dollars by 5 or 10, as long as the dollar is the posted price currency for oil, which it still is.
[01:41:53.952 --> 01:41:55.172]  So that's a really big thing.
[01:41:55.672 --> 01:42:00.736]  The other things we've got going are the coming of Petraeus and the increased power of the neocons.
[01:42:00.736 --> 01:42:10.324]  There's a big freakout in the U.S.-British diplomatic circles about what you just mentioned, that Brazil and Turkey attempted to mediate the crisis.
[01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:19.011]  There's also the fact that the weaponry that's being accumulated by Iran, by Syria, by Hezbollah, and maybe even by Hamas is also building up.
[01:42:20.132 --> 01:42:25.294]  So a conjuncture of, you know, five or ten different things coming together.
[01:42:25.294 --> 01:42:28.775]  So we now have to say that there is a very acute danger.
[01:42:28.775 --> 01:42:35.837]  And I would point to this statement about two weeks ago from Fidel Castro, right, the dictator of Cuba.
[01:42:35.837 --> 01:42:37.477]  He's really the head of state.
[01:42:37.477 --> 01:42:39.738]  He's the comandante en jefe.
[01:42:39.738 --> 01:42:42.259]  He's not officially the head of state, but really he is.
[01:42:42.259 --> 01:42:45.740]  He runs Cuba even if it's from his sickbed.
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:48.901]  So he called an emergency session to the Cuban parliament and said,
[01:42:49.893 --> 01:42:53.594]  We're facing a situation of imminent nuclear war.
[01:42:53.594 --> 01:43:00.816]  Now, some people would say, well, he's crazy or he's a communist, but you have to think about the resources that he brings to the table.
[01:43:00.816 --> 01:43:02.657]  He has an intelligence agency, right?
[01:43:02.657 --> 01:43:07.878]  It's the DGI, the Dirección General de Informaciones, and they have spies.
[01:43:07.878 --> 01:43:15.720]  We just had a guy in the State Department and his wife who was put away, I think, for life after spending decades and decades spying for Cuba.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.181]  So Castro draws on
[01:43:18.041 --> 01:43:21.742]  But you don't even need that!
[01:43:21.742 --> 01:43:41.528]  They've turned the propaganda back on and are testing the public market testing for the attack saying they've got to do it and they've been building up the military forces and now he comes out and talks about a criminal global government and endorses a book saying it's a eugenics empire that controls the planet.
[01:43:41.528 --> 01:43:42.268]  This is amazing!
[01:43:42.861 --> 01:43:54.910]  Yeah, and remember, what goes on in public, in other words, when you get a member of the Likud who visits the United States and pops off in some warmonger, bellicose vein, that may just be propaganda.
[01:43:54.910 --> 01:44:00.895]  That just may be an attempt to keep support going and to keep the Middle East conflict in the public eye.
[01:44:01.335 --> 01:44:14.084]  And all that, but again, I think Castro is basing this on things that are from behind the scenes, not just propaganda, not just psi-war, not just the attempt to blackmail people with threats of war, but real war preparations.
[01:44:14.084 --> 01:44:30.235]  Now, just in the past weekend, people may be disoriented because Hillary Clinton came out and announced that we've got the resumption for the first time in nine years of the direct talks between the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority of Abu Abbas, Abu Mazen.
[01:44:30.855 --> 01:44:38.242]  But of course, this is probably the weakest attempt at negotiations we've ever seen.
[01:44:38.242 --> 01:44:42.345]  Well, they always try a negotiation before a new war to say, see, we tried.
[01:44:42.345 --> 01:44:43.386]  Quite possibly.
[01:44:43.386 --> 01:44:52.093]  And the thing is, the Israelis did a tank thrust into Gaza this past weekend, so it's a very strange combination.
[01:44:52.093 --> 01:44:57.298]  And they also sent fighter aircraft into Lebanon and other areas over the weekend.
[01:44:57.478 --> 01:45:01.181]  Right, so this doesn't look like it's very serious.
[01:45:01.181 --> 01:45:08.385]  And if Netanyahu says he's going to start building settlements again, and if he does, then these talks will come to a very quick end.
[01:45:08.385 --> 01:45:11.167]  Now, on the Iranian side, we've had all sorts of things, right?
[01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:18.952]  They had a photo op where they displayed all these graves in the desert saying, here, Americans, Israelis, these are the graves for your soldiers.
[01:45:18.952 --> 01:45:22.735]  They're now showing these attack drones, the ambassador of death.
[01:45:22.995 --> 01:45:25.618]  What is the message that they've put the messenger of death in Lebanon?
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:54.169]  They may well be, because what they've put there for sure are these M600 short-range ballistic missiles with guidance systems, which actually can be used to target specific military targets.
[01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:57.332]  So, no longer counter-value for Hezbollah.
[01:45:57.332 --> 01:45:59.674]  No longer terror attacks on Israeli cities.
[01:46:00.294 --> 01:46:07.361]  But now, counter-force attacks on the air bases where the Israeli Air Force operates inside Israel.
[01:46:07.361 --> 01:46:09.042]  That is very, very scary.
[01:46:09.042 --> 01:46:15.268]  That's the kind of thing that pushes the situation towards this desperation.
[01:46:15.268 --> 01:46:18.812]  Now, the Bushehr reactor, this has gotten a lot of attention.
[01:46:19.824 --> 01:46:24.172]  There's a reactor, interestingly, that was begun about 30 years ago.
[01:46:24.172 --> 01:46:28.539]  It was actually begun before Ayatollah Khomeini took over Iran.
[01:46:28.539 --> 01:46:30.343]  And when Ayatollah Khomeini came in,
[01:46:31.101 --> 01:46:35.625]  He shut down the entire nuclear program of Iran.
[01:46:35.625 --> 01:46:42.472]  They would have had, without Khomeini, they would have had 10 or 15 functioning nuclear reactors, plenty of nuclear power.
[01:46:42.472 --> 01:46:44.454]  This whole thing would be a non-issue.
[01:46:44.454 --> 01:46:53.503]  But Khomeini, who was of course favored by Carter and Brzezinski, right, as their Islamic card against the Soviets, as it turned out to be,
[01:46:54.392 --> 01:46:54.912]  Thank you very much.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:26.563]  Technicians we had Bolton this the former UN ambassador of the neocons right of the bush regime the younger Saying that if you want to attack you've got to do that now in the next well when he said it seven or eight days it would basically be now in the next
[01:47:27.659 --> 01:47:27.999]  I think so.
[01:47:44.489 --> 01:47:47.291]  You're always going to be spreading nuclear debris.
[01:47:47.291 --> 01:47:55.056]  Any attack on any nuclear facility, be it centrifuges or uranium enrichment or whatever it is, that's going to spread radioactive debris.
[01:47:55.056 --> 01:48:00.659]  So there really is no basis to say, even from these guys' points of view, that it has to be done now.
[01:48:00.659 --> 01:48:07.743]  So what Bolton was trying to do was to get a new wave of hysteria and perhaps even act as a cover for an attack.
[01:48:07.743 --> 01:48:09.525]  But that may not happen.
[01:48:09.525 --> 01:48:11.486]  But his deadline was always a fake deadline.
[01:48:11.486 --> 01:48:13.167]  The deadlines go on and on.
[01:48:14.428 --> 01:48:16.151]  It doesn't change.
[01:48:16.151 --> 01:48:27.129]  So, we've then got this military situation and I think if you look back to the Lebanon War of four years ago,
[01:48:27.924 --> 01:48:46.912]  Remember that the Israelis fared very, very badly in that war because they were confronting, in those days, Hezbollah, armed with some fairly modern Soviet block and Russian equipment, which was sufficient to destroy the vaunted Merkava tank that the Israelis had built up.
[01:48:47.872 --> 01:48:51.414]  We're parading as an invincible war machine.
[01:48:51.414 --> 01:48:52.575]  That certainly didn't happen.
[01:48:52.575 --> 01:49:00.578]  And now, this time around, you'd have to say Hezbollah has actually increased its armament with the help of Iran and with the help of Syria.
[01:49:00.578 --> 01:49:09.743]  They have got, in addition to these old-fashioned World War II-style rockets, the Grad or the Katyusha or whatever they are,
[01:49:10.263 --> 01:49:13.924]  They've also got these handheld anti-aircraft missiles, right?
[01:49:13.924 --> 01:49:16.425]  The Grail, the Gremlin, and the Grouse.
[01:49:16.425 --> 01:49:17.465]  These are like the U.S.
[01:49:17.465 --> 01:49:18.205]  Stinger.
[01:49:18.205 --> 01:49:23.427]  They can be used to shoot down airplanes and helicopters, you know, flying at fairly low levels.
[01:49:23.427 --> 01:49:27.008]  Well, Webster, so the odds are being evened out here.
[01:49:27.008 --> 01:49:30.149]  But I have a question, you know, geopolitically, from your research of the region.
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:32.001]  I don't
[01:49:46.923 --> 01:49:48.924]  It just means which side do you take?
[01:49:48.924 --> 01:49:51.005]  Israel wants to knock out Iran.
[01:49:51.005 --> 01:49:53.806]  Iran wants to knock them out.
[01:49:53.806 --> 01:49:57.868]  And so from the Israeli perspective, do they have any choice?
[01:49:57.868 --> 01:50:00.069]  Because I'm against these wars, against World War III.
[01:50:00.069 --> 01:50:01.290]  I don't like what Israel's doing.
[01:50:01.290 --> 01:50:02.330]  I'm against it.
[01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:07.773]  But I mean, what is Israel's choice then if they back down?
[01:50:07.773 --> 01:50:09.634]  Is there any chance the Arabs will back down?
[01:50:10.325 --> 01:50:26.047]  I think the choice is a regional peace conference involving all states in the region and also certain non-state actors like Hezbollah or Hamas or others that act as a strategic force.
[01:50:27.269 --> 01:50:32.533]  You mentioned this article in the Atlantic Monthly by Jeffrey Goldberg, right?
[01:50:32.533 --> 01:50:40.741]  The idea that the Israeli attack on Iran is inevitable because Iran poses this existential life-or-death threat
[01:50:41.348 --> 01:50:41.829]  Stay there.
[01:50:41.829 --> 01:50:43.070]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:43.431]  Webster Darby.
[01:51:00.816 --> 01:51:02.117]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.117 --> 01:51:07.699]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.699 --> 01:51:12.721]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.721 --> 01:51:13.201]  It's true.
[01:51:13.201 --> 01:51:17.743]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.283 --> 01:51:23.507]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.507 --> 01:51:25.828]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:25.828 --> 01:51:30.631]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.631 --> 01:51:31.752]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.752 --> 01:51:34.814]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.814 --> 01:51:38.437]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.437 --> 01:51:41.639]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:41.639 --> 01:51:43.860]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:44.781]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:49.784 --> 01:51:52.646]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:52.646 --> 01:51:57.488]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.488 --> 01:51:59.870]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.879 --> 01:52:01.479]  Attention!
[01:52:01.479 --> 01:52:06.480]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:12.161]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[01:52:12.161 --> 01:52:19.302]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[01:52:19.302 --> 01:52:28.064]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[01:52:29.264 --> 01:52:32.425]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[01:52:32.425 --> 01:52:39.249]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[01:52:39.249 --> 01:52:48.213]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[01:52:48.213 --> 01:52:52.815]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[01:52:53.155 --> 01:52:54.155]  800-902-6969.
[01:52:54.155 --> 01:52:57.476]  800-902-6969.
[01:52:57.476 --> 01:53:01.178]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[01:53:01.178 --> 01:53:06.259]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website, yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:06.259 --> 01:53:09.020]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.921]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:11.221 --> 01:53:12.642]  Okay, here it comes.

[01:53:14.543 --> 01:53:18.466]  67 other products merely treat symptoms and not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:18.466 --> 01:53:22.149]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:29.894]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:53:29.894 --> 01:53:30.775]  Sinofresh.

[01:53:52.083 --> 01:53:52.483]  It works!
[01:54:07.443 --> 01:54:09.605]  Okay, I got a lot of key news coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:09.605 --> 01:54:15.208]  First your calls, Dan, Virgil, Will, Ron, Ronnie, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:54:15.208 --> 01:54:23.514]  But finishing up with Webster, you were getting into Jeffrey Goldberg, the Israeli asset, and he's been all over NPR, you name it, promoting.
[01:54:23.514 --> 01:54:25.876]  It's sad, but it's a foregone conclusion.
[01:54:25.876 --> 01:54:32.680]  We've got to do it, because they're going to nuke us if we don't, and Israel's going to do it, but you're saying that that's just talk.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:33.361]  What's behind that?
[01:54:33.681 --> 01:54:34.823]  I think it's propaganda.
[01:54:34.823 --> 01:54:37.826]  It's the kind of talk that can lead to tragic consequences.
[01:54:37.826 --> 01:54:41.631]  You have this guy, Trita Parsi, who is a fairly mainline academic.
[01:54:41.631 --> 01:54:44.214]  He's obviously of Iranian background.
[01:54:44.214 --> 01:54:51.123]  So he essentially has assembled a book about secret negotiations among Iran, Israel, the United States.
[01:54:52.114 --> 01:55:11.612]  And he points to the fact that Ehud Barak, the former, well, the current Defense Minister of Israel, tells the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aranoth, September 2009, so less than a year ago, quote, I am not among those who believe that Iran is an existential issue for Israel.
[01:55:11.612 --> 01:55:16.116]  Then we have the foreign minister of Israel in the previous government, Tzipi Livni,
[01:55:16.696 --> 01:55:25.683]  He argues, according to Haaretz, in private, that a nuclear Iran is not an existential threat to Israel.
[01:55:25.683 --> 01:55:41.676]  This guy himself, Trita Parsi, says he talked to the former head of the Mossad, Efraim Halevi, and Halevi says the idea that Iran can destroy Israel creates the dangerous impression, the false impression, that Israel is helpless and vulnerable.
[01:55:41.676 --> 01:55:44.438]  And Halevi said something like that in public.
[01:55:44.438 --> 01:55:45.379]  So I think there's a...
[01:55:46.019 --> 01:55:54.665]  There's actually a greater strategic sobriety, awareness of the realities in the Israeli leadership than what they're putting on.
[01:55:54.665 --> 01:56:04.652]  And I think it is, in some ways, the desire to code the United States into some aggressive actions by using this kind of rhetoric.
[01:56:04.652 --> 01:56:07.394]  And to code Iran into more aggressive rhetoric.
[01:56:07.774 --> 01:56:10.375]  Let me just point to one thing.
[01:56:10.375 --> 01:56:14.556]  So far, we don't have any evidence that there's an Iranian nuclear program.
[01:56:14.556 --> 01:56:17.437]  We're still operating under the NIE of December 2007.
[01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:21.718]  Now, all the neocons are saying that's because of this guy Amiri.
[01:56:21.718 --> 01:56:26.339]  This is the famous Amiri, who was all over the internet, and now he went back to Iran.
[01:56:26.339 --> 01:56:27.419]  He was a double agent.
[01:56:27.419 --> 01:56:32.561]  He lied to us, and that's why we came to the wrong conclusion almost three years ago.
[01:56:32.561 --> 01:56:36.162]  There's no proof, and we have Flint Leverett, one of the
[01:56:36.882 --> 01:56:38.523]  We're good to go.
[01:56:54.028 --> 01:57:06.404]  Just one last thing is this John Mearsheimer, right, the professor of political science at the University of Chicago, who says if he had to give advice to Ahmadinejad, he would acquire a nuclear deterrent.
[01:57:07.125 --> 01:57:08.705]  Deterrent means deterrent.
[01:57:08.705 --> 01:57:10.586]  It's not a first strike force.
[01:57:10.586 --> 01:57:15.047]  It would be a modest nuclear deterrent that would simply guarantee that nobody's going to attack.
[01:57:15.047 --> 01:57:15.567]  No, I understand.
[01:57:15.567 --> 01:57:17.548]  Israel has hundreds of nukes.
[01:57:17.548 --> 01:57:18.028]  Certainly.
[01:57:18.028 --> 01:57:22.089]  And of course, Pakistan has hundreds of, well, at least a significant number.
[01:57:22.089 --> 01:57:25.430]  Pakistan is actually an example of a country that the U.S.
[01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:29.531]  might like to attack but does not attack because they do have nuclear weapons.
[01:57:30.971 --> 01:57:36.193]  There's a lot of fakery, but the answer to this would be a regional peace conference.
[01:57:36.193 --> 01:57:37.733]  The Israelis feel threatened?
[01:57:37.733 --> 01:57:38.213]  Yeah, fine.
[01:57:38.213 --> 01:57:39.834]  The Iranians feel more threatened.
[01:57:39.834 --> 01:57:41.994]  So, go to the table.
[01:57:41.994 --> 01:57:44.895]  Webster, we're out of time and I have one more question.
[01:57:44.895 --> 01:57:47.716]  What do you think of Hamid Gul, former head of Pakistani intelligence?
[01:57:47.716 --> 01:57:56.358]  He came on this show and said that the West is staging events to stir up the Muslims in Central Asia as a pretext to expand war.
[01:57:56.954 --> 01:57:57.835]  Absolutely.
[01:57:57.835 --> 01:58:00.356]  Anything coming from him, I would take very seriously.
[01:58:00.356 --> 01:58:05.119]  He's obviously been widely demonized, but I don't think there's too much basis for that.
[01:58:05.119 --> 01:58:10.803]  So, again, the main guy going after him is Assange, right, of WikiLeaks.
[01:58:10.803 --> 01:58:12.944]  And we just saw Assange over the weekend.
[01:58:12.944 --> 01:58:15.545]  He dyed his hair, Alex.
[01:58:15.545 --> 01:58:16.146]  Did you see?
[01:58:16.146 --> 01:58:17.867]  Assange is no longer a blonde.
[01:58:17.867 --> 01:58:22.730]  Yeah, but doesn't that... I mean, that looks like they're trying to set him up, claiming he was molesting people, and it's not true.
[01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:27.131]  I think he's essentially had the charges dropped.
[01:58:27.131 --> 01:58:35.274]  The reason the blonde stuff is interesting is this cult that his family's associated with, the Anne Hamilton Byrne cult, where they gave kids LSD.
[01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.715]  All the kids in that cult had to be dyed blonde.
[01:58:37.715 --> 01:58:43.036]  So maybe he's trying to show us that he's... Yeah.
[01:58:43.036 --> 01:58:46.477]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:55.710 --> 01:59:58.473]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.444 --> 02:00:10.286]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.286 --> 02:00:11.867]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.867 --> 02:00:13.427]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.427 --> 02:00:17.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.609 --> 02:00:21.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:42.493]  All right, a lot of incredibly important news coming up in this hour.
[02:00:42.493 --> 02:00:49.339]  Philly is requiring bloggers to pay $300 for a business license, saying free speech is a privilege.
[02:00:49.339 --> 02:00:51.501]  You cannot make this up.
[02:00:51.501 --> 02:00:54.503]  Also, I want to get into toxic legacy of U.S.
[02:00:54.503 --> 02:00:56.265]  assault on Fallujah.
[02:00:56.265 --> 02:01:02.390]  There's a four-fold increase in cancer and a 12-fold increase in childhood cancers in that city alone.
[02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:06.934]  We're seeing a doubling and a tripling, depending on the study, in cancers in the troops.
[02:01:07.674 --> 02:01:08.014]  U.S.
[02:01:08.014 --> 02:01:12.857]  troops and contractors, because they use this DU all over the country.
[02:01:12.857 --> 02:01:18.581]  Also, a key article written by Matt Ryan up at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:18.581 --> 02:01:19.562]  Amazing video.
[02:01:19.562 --> 02:01:21.383]  I'm going to play this later in the hour.
[02:01:21.383 --> 02:01:27.106]  Black construction worker chased away from Ground Zero by crazed mob.
[02:01:27.106 --> 02:01:28.287]  It's hot in New York.
[02:01:28.287 --> 02:01:30.529]  The guy's wearing a cap to stop sweat.
[02:01:32.002 --> 02:01:35.063]  He's got an American flag around his neck, necklace.
[02:01:35.063 --> 02:01:36.303]  He tells them I'm not a Muslim.
[02:01:36.303 --> 02:01:41.104]  But even if he was, why should they be chasing him, screaming at him and running after him?
[02:01:41.104 --> 02:01:42.924]  That is all coming up.
[02:01:42.924 --> 02:01:50.146]  Also, Obama gains foreign support against the Second Amendment, more on what's happening in Mexico.
[02:01:50.146 --> 02:01:56.067]  But right now, I want to go to your phone calls, as promised, and I appreciate you holding
[02:01:56.767 --> 02:02:10.857]  But I'm not only going to cover this report about Obama against foreign support against Second Amendment, there's another report on InfoWars.com about 100,000 American-made rifles that are not allowed to be sold in the United States.
[02:02:10.857 --> 02:02:13.779]  So we're going to talk about that report as well.
[02:02:13.779 --> 02:02:18.422]  The headline is 100,000 American-made rifles not allowed to be sold in the United States.
[02:02:18.422 --> 02:02:21.744]  One of the tiles up on InfoWars.com.
[02:02:21.744 --> 02:02:23.125]  Dan in Wisconsin.
[02:02:23.125 --> 02:02:23.966]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:02:24.727 --> 02:02:26.368]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[02:02:26.368 --> 02:02:28.329]  I'm an Army veteran.
[02:02:28.329 --> 02:02:30.950]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:33.892]  I've been listening to your show for about three months now.
[02:02:33.892 --> 02:02:36.353]  I actually just woke up.
[02:02:36.353 --> 02:02:37.994]  Pretty much everything that's going on.
[02:02:37.994 --> 02:02:43.757]  Actually, when I was in the Army about 20 years ago, I read the book N.D.C.C., Don't Dare Call It Conspiracy.
[02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:47.371]  I kind of woke me up, but I fell asleep for a long time.
[02:02:47.371 --> 02:02:48.953]  Became a neocon pretty much.
[02:02:48.953 --> 02:02:51.215]  Well, that's why it's important to reach out to people.
[02:02:51.215 --> 02:02:55.139]  Seeds get planted that don't sprout sometimes for decades.
[02:02:55.139 --> 02:03:00.043]  And now, those millions of seeds that patriots have planted, they're now starting to sprout.
[02:03:00.043 --> 02:03:05.569]  So you've got to plant more seeds, and it may take years, but others will then sprout.
[02:03:05.569 --> 02:03:09.993]  Yeah, you know, I've been talking to guys, too, you know, in my area that have heard of you.
[02:03:10.595 --> 02:03:14.217]  But they're just kind of still, like, you know, just kind of waiting for whatever.
[02:03:14.217 --> 02:03:32.946]  I don't know what they're waiting for, but I'm trying to... You know, I purchased a couple of years ago the Obama deception, and, uh... and brought it to the Republic, and I've been trying to show that to as many people as I can, and, uh... But I've got a question for you regarding the Cybersecurity Act, protecting cybersecurity as a national asset.
[02:03:32.946 --> 02:03:33.406]  I've been on
[02:03:35.015 --> 02:03:41.898]  I've been communicating with my Senator, one of my Senators here in Wisconsin, Herb Kohl, regarding this issue.
[02:03:41.898 --> 02:03:51.962]  And basically, you know, last time, last email, last email I sent him, I asked him some, I thought they were pretty legitimate questions.
[02:03:51.962 --> 02:03:54.703]  I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.
[02:03:54.703 --> 02:03:57.964]  But I thought they were legitimate questions, like, you know, define a cyber attack.
[02:04:00.017 --> 02:04:04.860]  You know, mentioning Rockefeller as one of the major proponents.
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:06.641]  Jay Rockefeller.
[02:04:06.641 --> 02:04:15.527]  Yeah, and basically all I get back from the Senator is basically what they've already done.
[02:04:15.527 --> 02:04:20.571]  Well, even mainstream media admits it gives the government a kill switch and starts taking over the internet.
[02:04:21.897 --> 02:04:22.458]  Right, right.
[02:04:22.458 --> 02:04:28.569]  So, you know, what do you guys, I guess, I don't like to say alternative media, I like to say true media.
[02:04:28.569 --> 02:04:31.774]  You guys in the true media, mostly on the internet, I guess.
[02:04:33.317 --> 02:04:34.318]  Is there a plan B?
[02:04:34.318 --> 02:04:37.099]  I don't want to sound like a defeatist.
[02:04:37.099 --> 02:04:41.802]  Well, we've got to fight for this internet, the free internet, and use it while we've got it.
[02:04:41.802 --> 02:04:43.143]  But there will be plan Bs.
[02:04:43.143 --> 02:04:45.584]  There will be alternate systems that are developed.
[02:04:45.584 --> 02:04:48.086]  But let's not give them the field.
[02:04:48.086 --> 02:04:49.347]  Let's fight.
[02:04:49.347 --> 02:04:53.409]  And if we expose their admitted plan, there's no way they'll get it done.
[02:04:53.409 --> 02:04:54.830]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:56.651]  Then more of your calls.
[02:04:56.651 --> 02:04:57.852]  Some other key info.
[02:04:57.852 --> 02:04:59.733]  They're trying to enlist all high schoolers in ROTC.
[02:05:00.424 --> 02:05:05.408]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:05:05.408 --> 02:05:06.388]  What have we got?
[02:05:06.388 --> 02:05:08.850]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:05:08.850 --> 02:05:09.851]  A republic.
[02:05:09.851 --> 02:05:12.493]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:05:12.493 --> 02:05:14.755]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:05:14.755 --> 02:05:16.776]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:05:16.776 --> 02:05:18.457]  So they think they own our land?
[02:05:18.457 --> 02:05:19.778]  They think they own our water?
[02:05:19.778 --> 02:05:20.399]  Children?
[02:05:20.399 --> 02:05:21.520]  Our education?
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.340]  Our money?
[02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:26.003]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:05:26.363 --> 02:05:31.329]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:05:31.329 --> 02:05:32.350]  We have the facts.
[02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:33.532]  We have the Constitution.
[02:05:33.532 --> 02:05:34.413]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:05:34.413 --> 02:05:35.314]  We have common law.
[02:05:35.314 --> 02:05:37.837]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:37.837 --> 02:05:41.621]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[02:07:52.447 --> 02:07:53.268]  Thank you!
[02:08:03.738 --> 02:08:08.700]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:14.364]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:14.364 --> 02:08:20.247]  We had a caller who just joined us in the last segment who was saying, how do we stop the cyber security takeover?
[02:08:20.247 --> 02:08:25.490]  Well, I made a Google video over the weekend that we need to go mega viral.
[02:08:28.527 --> 02:08:42.719]  Google's plans to take over the internet exposed, and it shows how Google is the main vehicle of Internet 2, in their own words, to take over the web, surveil the web, track everything we're doing, and gatekeep.
[02:08:42.719 --> 02:08:47.123]  So it's key to get that video out if you're talking about solutions.
[02:08:47.123 --> 02:08:55.310]  But also, there is a report out of the Examiner, Philly requiring bloggers to pay $300 for a business license.
[02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:56.711]  And they say, for the privilege.
[02:08:58.427 --> 02:08:59.787]  It's not a privilege to travel.
[02:08:59.787 --> 02:09:00.507]  They tell you it is.
[02:09:00.507 --> 02:09:01.708]  It's not a privilege to own a gun.
[02:09:01.708 --> 02:09:03.168]  Now they tell you it is.
[02:09:03.168 --> 02:09:14.030]  We've been brainwashed about this and I tell you the good news is last night after the Sunday show I took the guys from the Sunday crew to dinner.
[02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:23.152]  We were downtown and I walk outside about to leave and two police officers are there on their bikes and this happened the last time I was downtown about a month ago.
[02:09:23.973 --> 02:09:26.475]  They came over and were both listeners and supporters.
[02:09:26.475 --> 02:09:41.305]  This fella comes over and he goes, listen, I'm an Oath Keeper and I've been listening to your show for years and a lot of us are waking up and my partner's awake and they were genuine and shook my hand and said, you know, we're ready to do whatever it takes, you know, to fight this new world order.
[02:09:41.305 --> 02:09:43.426]  And we know how real all this is.
[02:09:43.426 --> 02:09:51.111]  And they went on to talk about how the system is collapsing things by design and also making the public immoral so that the state
[02:09:52.051 --> 02:09:55.492]  comes in with more control and the public will actually beg for it.
[02:09:55.492 --> 02:09:58.072]  They understood everything.
[02:09:58.072 --> 02:10:05.154]  So, I mean, now every time I talk to Austin cops, every time they're listeners, every time they're aware of what's going on.
[02:10:05.154 --> 02:10:07.075]  So it's very positive.
[02:10:07.075 --> 02:10:12.436]  And that's why the media shows police in Denver beating a guy up, walking his dog for no reason.
[02:10:12.436 --> 02:10:13.996]  And it's wrong they're doing that.
[02:10:13.996 --> 02:10:18.877]  And then they don't ever prosecute them to put out the image that it's okay for bad cops to act like that.
[02:10:18.877 --> 02:10:20.678]  And then they promote the bad cops.
[02:10:21.957 --> 02:10:31.723]  But they want you to know about it so you start hating police, so they then implode into their own gang mentality of us against them.
[02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:33.163]  But that was very positive.
[02:10:33.163 --> 02:10:34.984]  But look at this story.
[02:10:34.984 --> 02:10:39.967]  Philly requiring bloggers to pay $300 for a business license.
[02:10:39.967 --> 02:10:45.070]  It looks like cash-hungry local governments are getting awfully rapacious these days.
[02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:49.633]  Between her blog and infrequent contributions to ehow.com,
[02:10:50.856 --> 02:10:53.317]  Over the last few years, she has made about $50.
[02:10:53.317 --> 02:10:56.919]  To Marilyn Bess, her website is a hobby.
[02:10:56.919 --> 02:11:01.400]  To the city of Philadelphia, it's a potential moneymaker, and the city wants its cut.
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:06.723]  What an incredible precedent for cities to start demanding money for you to be able to have a blog.
[02:11:07.915 --> 02:11:08.855]  And this is how they want to do it.
[02:11:08.855 --> 02:11:10.796]  They want to come in with taxes, regulations.
[02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:13.277]  That's how they're going to kill the Internet as we know it.
[02:11:13.277 --> 02:11:19.919]  In May, the city sent Bess a letter demanding that she pay $300, the price of a business privilege license.
[02:11:19.919 --> 02:11:25.982]  See, her First Amendment, they're now saying, is a privilege.
[02:11:25.982 --> 02:11:32.184]  In May, the city sent Bess a letter demanding that she pay $300, the price of a business privilege license.
[02:11:33.055 --> 02:11:40.463]  The real kick in the pants is I don't even have a full-time job, so the city to tell me to pony up $300 for a business privilege.
[02:11:40.463 --> 02:11:41.685]  It's a privilege!
[02:11:41.685 --> 02:11:42.406]  They love using that.
[02:11:42.406 --> 02:11:44.208]  No, it's not a privilege.
[02:11:44.208 --> 02:11:50.194]  Pay wage tax, business privilege tax, net profits tax, and a handful of money is outrageous.
[02:11:50.194 --> 02:11:51.055]  See, they'll send out...
[02:11:52.114 --> 02:11:54.098]  IRS over 4 cents at a car wash.
[02:11:54.098 --> 02:11:58.306]  Or they'll send state people out to seize your bank account over 25 cents.
[02:11:58.306 --> 02:12:01.331]  But they're not going to go after Goldman Sachs and others that have stolen $23.7 trillion.
[02:12:01.331 --> 02:12:02.453]  It's now $28 trillion plus.
[02:12:05.559 --> 02:12:11.641]  All the regulators are to target you, and they can use zoning and business taxes to destroy whatever they want.
[02:12:11.641 --> 02:12:14.142]  And if you think this is bad, you ain't seen nothing yet with the carbon tax.
[02:12:14.142 --> 02:12:19.144]  I got a bunch of other news, but I said I'd go to your calls and I want to hear from you, but that listener brought that up.
[02:12:19.144 --> 02:12:21.705]  They want to kill freedom by a thousand cuts.
[02:12:21.705 --> 02:12:26.207]  We're going to beat them, and there's millions of us, with a million cuts right back to them.
[02:12:27.614 --> 02:12:33.838]  If you have this image of you gotta have this big tectonic final battle with tyranny, that's not how it works.
[02:12:33.838 --> 02:12:40.702]  It's a philosophy of resistance, a philosophy of strength, a philosophy of will, a philosophy of the truth.
[02:12:40.702 --> 02:12:43.724]  Our truth is more powerful than their lies.
[02:12:43.724 --> 02:12:45.205]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:12:45.205 --> 02:12:46.786]  Virgil in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[02:12:47.526 --> 02:12:50.289]  Hey Alex, thanks for all the work you've been doing.
[02:12:50.289 --> 02:12:52.151]  Woke up a lot of people.
[02:12:52.151 --> 02:12:53.112]  I had a question.
[02:12:53.112 --> 02:13:05.166]  Back in, I want to say March, maybe April, you said something about doing a show on where we, the public, listening public, draw our lines in the sand.
[02:13:05.166 --> 02:13:05.966]  Have you done that yet?
[02:13:06.991 --> 02:13:09.693]  Well, we've had guests on and taken calls about it.
[02:13:09.693 --> 02:13:11.094]  Where do you draw your line in the sand?
[02:13:11.094 --> 02:13:12.756]  But no, we should do that.
[02:13:12.756 --> 02:13:19.841]  In fact, tomorrow, for at least an hour or two of the broadcast, we'll ask that question, what's your line in the sand?
[02:13:19.841 --> 02:13:23.084]  On the Sunday show, I said, what's the biggest government lie?
[02:13:23.084 --> 02:13:30.389]  And how many lies will we put up with until we realize this is a criminal, bankrupt group run by a bunch of scum, you know, at the highest levels.
[02:13:30.389 --> 02:13:33.592]  They're trying to corrupt the lower levels to have full tyranny.
[02:13:33.592 --> 02:13:34.953]  But, I mean, you're live now.
[02:13:34.953 --> 02:13:35.854]  What's your line in the sand?
[02:13:36.494 --> 02:13:37.575]  Ah, Second Amendment, man.
[02:13:37.575 --> 02:13:38.555]  They come from my gun.
[02:13:38.555 --> 02:13:42.458]  That's self-defense right there.
[02:13:42.458 --> 02:13:51.443]  Well, they're trying to pass all sorts of taxation regulations as, oh, you didn't pay all the taxes or you didn't refile your form every year in Illinois.
[02:13:51.443 --> 02:13:52.644]  We're sending a SWAT team.
[02:13:52.644 --> 02:13:56.887]  They always create little legalese excuses for their infringements of our liberty.
[02:13:57.639 --> 02:14:00.261]  Well, they can come and take it if they want.
[02:14:00.261 --> 02:14:02.002]  They think they can try.
[02:14:02.002 --> 02:14:02.943]  So you're ready to die.
[02:14:02.943 --> 02:14:05.044]  I mean, that's a commendable attitude to have.
[02:14:05.044 --> 02:14:07.426]  If we all had that attitude, we'd have total liberty.
[02:14:07.426 --> 02:14:12.410]  And that's the big ace in the hole we have against tyranny, is that we are armed.
[02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:15.812]  This is not the Soviet Union, where the people were already serfs under the Tsar.
[02:14:15.812 --> 02:14:19.715]  This is not Communist China, where they were already serfs before Mao Zedong.
[02:14:19.715 --> 02:14:20.816]  This is the United States.
[02:14:20.816 --> 02:14:23.778]  And we may be fat, dunnum, and happy, but we're starting to wake up.
[02:14:24.776 --> 02:14:25.536]  Amen, sir.
[02:14:25.536 --> 02:14:26.717]  You have a nice day.
[02:14:26.717 --> 02:14:28.378]  Alright, good to hear from you, Virgil.
[02:14:28.378 --> 02:14:29.378]  Will in Ohio.
[02:14:29.378 --> 02:14:30.719]  Will, you're on the air.
[02:14:30.719 --> 02:14:31.579]  Hello, Alex.
[02:14:31.579 --> 02:14:32.859]  Hey, buddy.
[02:14:32.859 --> 02:14:40.943]  I was reading this morning from one of the Yahoo groups that I belong to, and they've got the UN wants a bill, I guess, to take all the
[02:14:42.787 --> 02:14:48.953]  Yeah, and then they tell the kids at school, do they make you go to church?
[02:14:48.953 --> 02:14:50.815]  And the nine-year-old goes, yeah, I don't like it.
[02:14:50.815 --> 02:14:52.776]  And then CPS comes and takes them.
[02:14:52.776 --> 02:14:55.519]  That's already being done for decades in the U.S.
[02:14:55.519 --> 02:15:00.444]  And so the schools are already saying, chattel on mommy if she isn't using the right light bulbs.
[02:15:00.444 --> 02:15:02.506]  Tell mommy not to take hot baths.
[02:15:02.506 --> 02:15:05.428]  And Prince Charles is traveling around telling the kids.
[02:15:06.349 --> 02:15:10.392]  Al Gore, two years ago, told kids, you tell your parents what to do.
[02:15:10.392 --> 02:15:20.480]  Well, now it's going to be, my child wants to have sex at 10, and I don't want to let them, and so the school taught them how to do it, and so CPS is going to take them.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:28.946]  Or my child, you know, the school told them that they could convert to some other religion, and I don't want them to be that, or an atheist, or whatever, and so they come and take it.
[02:15:28.946 --> 02:15:32.869]  Or, you know, your child, you don't want them taught all of this.
[02:15:32.869 --> 02:15:34.751]  They are turning your children against you.
[02:15:35.469 --> 02:15:36.710]  That's right, Alex.
[02:15:36.710 --> 02:15:40.053]  Well, the only way we can win this is by unity.
[02:15:40.053 --> 02:15:42.515]  We have to come together.
[02:15:42.515 --> 02:15:49.100]  When we had those power searches and stuff, you know, they had to acknowledge our voices.
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.862]  We are the majority.
[02:15:50.862 --> 02:15:51.862]  All the polls show that.
[02:15:51.862 --> 02:15:53.083]  We have the Constitution.
[02:15:53.083 --> 02:15:54.424]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:15:54.424 --> 02:15:55.325]  We know the truth.
[02:15:55.325 --> 02:15:57.107]  The system is scared.
[02:15:57.107 --> 02:15:59.589]  And that's why they're trying to co-op things with Glenn Beck and others.
[02:15:59.589 --> 02:16:00.810]  But it's not going to work.
[02:16:00.810 --> 02:16:02.191]  Just continue to get the word out, Will.
[02:16:02.847 --> 02:16:03.167]  All right.
[02:16:03.167 --> 02:16:03.828]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:03.828 --> 02:16:04.648]  God bless you, Will.
[02:16:04.648 --> 02:16:05.208]  Thank you.
[02:16:05.208 --> 02:16:06.309]  Don't thank me.
[02:16:06.309 --> 02:16:10.211]  Listen, again, we're all in this together, folks.
[02:16:10.211 --> 02:16:11.631]  I want to thank you.
[02:16:11.631 --> 02:16:13.112]  Let's talk to Ron in Texas.
[02:16:13.112 --> 02:16:14.993]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:16:14.993 --> 02:16:16.794]  Alex, pleasure to speak with you.
[02:16:16.794 --> 02:16:22.497]  I am a newly awakened patriot, thanks to several others out there in my own investigations.
[02:16:22.497 --> 02:16:25.558]  I'm ticked off, to be honest with you.
[02:16:25.558 --> 02:16:31.181]  Where, like the loud caller says, we're only going to survive.
[02:16:31.181 --> 02:16:32.542]  You've been doing a great job.
[02:16:33.188 --> 02:16:37.632]  Well, I've listened to you for about six months now.
[02:16:37.632 --> 02:16:41.715]  I've listened to other people like you, Mr. Newman, etc.
[02:16:41.715 --> 02:16:44.998]  But are we just going to continue talking about it?
[02:16:44.998 --> 02:16:48.440]  I mean, you can get all the information out there to everybody.
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:51.583]  And I know you don't want an armed revolution in this country.
[02:16:51.583 --> 02:16:53.564]  God forbid that that ever happens.
[02:16:53.564 --> 02:16:59.189]  But at the same time, we're on the brink of a third world war that could possibly wipe us all out.
[02:16:59.676 --> 02:17:07.964]  And if we're going to put people in the local government that's going to stop this tyranny, if we're going to put people into the county government, etc., that's going to take years.
[02:17:07.964 --> 02:17:08.985]  We don't have years.
[02:17:08.985 --> 02:17:10.446]  What are we supposed to do?
[02:17:10.446 --> 02:17:15.210]  Well, again, a very important question, and let me try to be as simple as possible.
[02:17:15.911 --> 02:17:29.798]  We always spend our time and energy, upwards of 60% turnouts, and more money spent than all the states combined, on these presidential elections, and we have on average about an 8.2 turnout at the county and city level.
[02:17:29.798 --> 02:17:35.581]  And the feds and the globalists and the offshore corporations, they're spending most of their money actually now in lobbying.
[02:17:35.581 --> 02:17:41.044]  They've shifted it to the states to block us, and they're demonizing the states' rights movement.
[02:17:41.044 --> 02:17:43.385]  It could only take three or four years, or
[02:17:44.105 --> 02:17:49.126]  The next two election cycles to really checkmate the globalists at the state level.
[02:17:49.126 --> 02:17:51.427]  So we fight on all fronts.
[02:17:51.427 --> 02:17:54.888]  But when you talk about, you know, we don't have time, what do we do?
[02:17:54.888 --> 02:18:00.690]  They had the lowest level of flu last year, flu deaths, because we had the lowest level of inoculations.
[02:18:00.690 --> 02:18:04.471]  It's the inoculations all the studies show that are actually killing people and making most of them sick.
[02:18:05.971 --> 02:18:08.612]  Hardly anybody took the H1N1 shot.
[02:18:08.612 --> 02:18:10.553]  It's come out now that it's a hoax.
[02:18:10.553 --> 02:18:12.734]  We've got to expose it again this year.
[02:18:12.734 --> 02:18:16.076]  They're just brazenly coming out saying you got to take H1N1 again.
[02:18:16.076 --> 02:18:18.297]  We're going to combine it with a regular flu shot.
[02:18:18.297 --> 02:18:19.578]  They're going to hype the fear again.
[02:18:19.578 --> 02:18:25.141]  We've got to expose the tenfold increase in seizures, brain damage, give people the mainstream news articles.
[02:18:26.161 --> 02:18:33.030]  The British Medical Journal, the EU Commission's admissions, how the big pharma is paying off, the politicians.
[02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:42.541]  You know, we're not gonna beat this overnight, but when we actually got involved and people put up flyers all over the world exposing the dead relief flu shots, we
[02:18:43.402 --> 02:18:45.163]  Kick their butt in this battle.
[02:18:45.163 --> 02:18:54.328]  And if we just keep battling, battling, battling, battling, battling, and realize that it's an incremental fight, we're going to climb this hill, take the machine gun nest, and defeat the enemy.
[02:18:54.328 --> 02:18:57.669]  We've already gone over the whole major mountain range.
[02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:59.590]  We're up to the big final mountain.
[02:18:59.590 --> 02:19:08.115]  The enemy's got its guns up at the top shooting at us, and it's going to be hell going up that mountain, but we don't have a magic helicopter to take us up to the top.
[02:19:08.675 --> 02:19:21.980]  We've got to fix things by fixing ourselves, by not being decadent, by not being evil, by not being corrupt, by dedicating time and energy, not looking for silver bullets, but simply putting one foot in front of the other.
[02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:24.961]  And it's that process that's going to fix this.
[02:19:24.961 --> 02:19:28.143]  Look, I mean, they're trying to push an Iran strike.
[02:19:28.143 --> 02:19:29.323]  People are exposing it.
[02:19:29.323 --> 02:19:30.424]  They may not get away with it.
[02:19:31.864 --> 02:19:35.765]  All the polls are against the wars, so they've had to lie and claim the war is over.
[02:19:35.765 --> 02:19:37.806]  We've got to point out that's a lie now.
[02:19:37.806 --> 02:19:41.987]  They're always going to come back, but we're gaining ground now.
[02:19:41.987 --> 02:19:45.288]  The establishment is losing ground.
[02:19:45.288 --> 02:19:50.070]  And so every time the people get motivated and take action, we have victory.
[02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:58.512]  The system stonewalls like we have no power, but more and more we see them finally collapse right at the moment that they look like they're invincible.
[02:19:58.512 --> 02:20:00.013]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you.
[02:20:01.036 --> 02:20:03.658]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[02:20:03.658 --> 02:20:12.464]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.

[02:20:50.769 --> 02:20:51.529]  What is a wind generator?
[02:20:51.529 --> 02:20:53.890]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:20:53.890 --> 02:20:56.011]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:20:56.011 --> 02:20:57.352]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[02:23:00.367 --> 02:23:00.947]  Attention!
[02:23:00.947 --> 02:23:05.949]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[02:23:05.949 --> 02:23:11.651]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[02:23:11.651 --> 02:23:18.794]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:23:18.794 --> 02:23:27.557]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:23:28.757 --> 02:23:31.901]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:23:31.901 --> 02:23:38.729]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:23:38.729 --> 02:23:47.519]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[02:23:47.679 --> 02:23:52.322]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[02:23:52.322 --> 02:23:54.803]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again, 800-902-6969 Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss
[02:24:15.155 --> 02:24:18.536]  Okay, I got a big news blitz coming up, and I want to continue with your calls.
[02:24:18.536 --> 02:24:30.880]  Ron, we have to fight on all fronts, but the big blind spot of the globalists, the founding fathers built into the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, is states' rights, and that's why they're demonizing it.
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:32.480]  And so we are in trouble.
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.881]  We're in trouble because we let these criminals take over.
[02:24:35.621 --> 02:24:37.763]  Uh, but everybody's always looking for a silver bullet.
[02:24:37.763 --> 02:24:40.764]  I mean, if you've got one, you're welcome to tell me what it is.
[02:24:40.764 --> 02:24:47.389]  If people get violent, that's the excuse that they've been, uh, hoping for to really try to clamp down.
[02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:53.032]  And we might end up winning that way, but it's going to be very dangerous, very disastrous.
[02:24:53.032 --> 02:24:58.376]  And generally in history, violent revolutions end up with something even worse than what you were fighting against.
[02:24:58.376 --> 02:25:00.117]  Go ahead.
[02:25:00.117 --> 02:25:03.519]  Well, just two quick questions and I'll get off and let you answer them.
[02:25:03.519 --> 02:25:04.960]  Uh, first of all, case in point,
[02:25:05.416 --> 02:25:08.658]  Mr. Perry Treason Sotaro, we know he's illegal.
[02:25:08.658 --> 02:25:10.260]  Why is he still there?
[02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:11.661]  Isn't there something that we can do?
[02:25:11.661 --> 02:25:18.526]  Like you see in movies all the time where they sit there and they take a person out of power because of whatever the case is.
[02:25:18.526 --> 02:25:20.427]  When they take over a submarine, for example.
[02:25:20.427 --> 02:25:21.928]  Hey, you need to step down.
[02:25:21.928 --> 02:25:22.909]  You're not doing it right.
[02:25:22.909 --> 02:25:24.290]  What can we do about that?
[02:25:24.290 --> 02:25:25.811]  Why is he still in there?
[02:25:25.811 --> 02:25:27.152]  Second question, Alex.
[02:25:27.152 --> 02:25:28.473]  It's been a pleasure to speak with you.
[02:25:28.473 --> 02:25:30.574]  I just rolled through Austin.
[02:25:30.574 --> 02:25:34.357]  I do twice a week from Laredo to Michigan twice a week.
[02:25:34.693 --> 02:25:36.154]  You got a building right off the highway.
[02:25:36.154 --> 02:25:39.116]  It looks like it's got crystal palaces growing up out of the top of it.
[02:25:39.116 --> 02:25:40.477]  What is that?
[02:25:40.477 --> 02:25:44.840]  You're talking about the big Frost Owl building?
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:45.200]  I guess.
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:46.641]  It looks like something out of Superman.
[02:25:46.641 --> 02:25:48.503]  There's a crystal palace up at the top.
[02:25:48.503 --> 02:25:49.523]  Very beautiful building.
[02:25:49.523 --> 02:25:51.405]  Well, that's the big owl building.
[02:25:51.405 --> 02:25:52.425]  I appreciate your call.
[02:25:52.425 --> 02:25:58.770]  Look, Obama is a puppet who's meant to be politically destroyed just like
[02:26:00.714 --> 02:26:05.035]  George W. Bush was, and then they will remove the puppet and give us a new puppet.
[02:26:05.035 --> 02:26:08.297]  And that goes back to why do we obsess over presidents?
[02:26:08.297 --> 02:26:13.758]  It's our Congress that's given up control over trade, given up control over the monetary system to private banks.
[02:26:13.758 --> 02:26:16.299]  We have to even get our government back.
[02:26:16.299 --> 02:26:19.580]  This government we have is out of control.
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:21.241]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:26:21.241 --> 02:26:23.382]  Let's talk to Tim in Virginia.
[02:26:23.382 --> 02:26:24.182]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:26:26.872 --> 02:26:27.772]  Greetings, Alex.
[02:26:27.772 --> 02:26:30.013]  I must commend you for your efforts.
[02:26:30.013 --> 02:26:30.753]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:26:30.753 --> 02:26:31.934]  I commend you for your efforts.
[02:26:31.934 --> 02:26:32.734]  Go ahead.
[02:26:32.734 --> 02:26:34.715]  Yeah, well, I'm like most Americans.
[02:26:34.715 --> 02:26:38.176]  We're not happy with the economy.
[02:26:38.176 --> 02:26:40.697]  We're not happy the way things got rammed through.
[02:26:40.697 --> 02:26:45.019]  And, you know, Iran.
[02:26:45.019 --> 02:26:47.460]  What is going to be our priorities?
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:55.983]  What are states going to do to create jobs by furnishing economic incentives for, like, automotive companies to come to their state
[02:26:56.713 --> 02:26:58.094]  Like a 30-year tax break?
[02:26:58.094 --> 02:27:00.376]  Well, they're globalist.
[02:27:00.376 --> 02:27:06.740]  They use the automaker bailout to move them to Brazil and China and Eastern Europe.
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.922]  So we have to, again, get rid of the traders.
[02:27:08.922 --> 02:27:10.683]  They want to destroy the middle class.
[02:27:10.683 --> 02:27:12.585]  They want to de-industrialize.
[02:27:12.585 --> 02:27:14.426]  They're doing this by design.
[02:27:14.426 --> 02:27:17.768]  So, again, we have to remove the criminals or we have no future.
[02:27:17.768 --> 02:27:18.829]  It's that simple.
[02:27:18.829 --> 02:27:20.791]  And any solution they give us
[02:27:22.085 --> 02:27:23.766]  Is always a lie.
[02:27:23.766 --> 02:27:25.827]  It's only about giving them more power.
[02:27:25.827 --> 02:27:30.889]  They've already committed so many crimes, so much looting, they're not going to stop.
[02:27:30.889 --> 02:27:39.832]  Well, Alex, I can only see that if the federal government start taxing these American corporations that are doing business outside of the U.S.
[02:27:39.832 --> 02:27:45.535]  with a 50% tax rate, they're going to have to decide, is it worth it?
[02:27:45.535 --> 02:27:47.075]  And that's the bottom line.
[02:27:47.075 --> 02:27:48.876]  But the bottom line is this, Alex.
[02:27:49.861 --> 02:27:56.624]  Our economy is a service economy, which basically means we're a prostitute economy.
[02:27:56.624 --> 02:27:59.366]  Our industrial manufacturing base is gone.
[02:27:59.366 --> 02:28:03.347]  Yeah, we're a client to China, which is the globalist model, absolutely.
[02:28:03.347 --> 02:28:13.532]  And the problem is that when you talk about Iran and all that masturbation rhetoric about the saber rattling, the bottom line is the U.S.
[02:28:13.532 --> 02:28:14.933]  can do the shock and awe.
[02:28:15.458 --> 02:28:21.100]  But when it comes to anything long-sustaining, our manufacturing base is not there.
[02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:28.542]  And if Israel is going to attack Iran, it's going to be using all 200 of their small tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:28:28.542 --> 02:28:30.923]  Well, they have some weapons that aren't tactical.
[02:28:30.923 --> 02:28:33.964]  They have larger nukes, but I appreciate your call.
[02:28:33.964 --> 02:28:36.085]  Because we all... Here's the problem.
[02:28:36.085 --> 02:28:38.486]  We keep looking at this as Americans.
[02:28:38.486 --> 02:28:42.287]  We keep looking at this as if our government cares about us.
[02:28:42.287 --> 02:28:44.508]  Our government is an offshore corporate group.
[02:28:45.208 --> 02:28:49.291]  That uses our tax money, our wealth, everything to enrich themselves.
[02:28:49.291 --> 02:28:56.737]  And if they're offshore globalists, of course they're going to have laws passed with tax incentives for them to move offshore.
[02:28:56.737 --> 02:28:59.459]  They're dealing in short-term profits.
[02:28:59.459 --> 02:29:09.487]  But in the wider scheme, it's short-term profits that empower them to be the only financial group left standing at the end of this situation.
[02:29:11.328 --> 02:29:13.310]  And that's not my opinion.
[02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:18.334]  Everything we talked about 13, 14, 15 years ago has now happened.
[02:29:18.334 --> 02:29:20.757]  Not because I'm a psychic.
[02:29:20.757 --> 02:29:26.562]  Not because I'm a gypsy with a traveling roadshow here or reading tarot cards.
[02:29:26.562 --> 02:29:28.884]  It's a globalist blueprint.
[02:29:28.884 --> 02:29:35.670]  When I get up here and tell you they're putting sterilants and vaccines, I have the Rockefeller Foundation documents linked to them on the website.
[02:29:36.351 --> 02:29:44.436]  When I tell you the government knows that sodium fluoride brain damages you, reduces IQ, causes cancer, they had studies in the 20s on that.
[02:29:44.436 --> 02:29:46.738]  They know what they're doing.
[02:29:46.738 --> 02:29:48.319]  They're pure evil.
[02:29:48.319 --> 02:29:51.120]  Nothing's going to get better until we remove these crooks.
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:52.521]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.521 --> 02:29:55.043]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.043 --> 02:29:57.725]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.353 --> 02:30:04.896]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.896 --> 02:30:05.817]  Number 1.
[02:30:05.817 --> 02:30:09.240]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.240 --> 02:30:10.100]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:14.984]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:14.984 --> 02:30:15.724]  It's true.
[02:30:15.724 --> 02:30:20.608]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.608 --> 02:30:21.429]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:25.011]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.011 --> 02:30:28.734]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:28.914 --> 02:30:29.714]  Number 4.
[02:30:29.714 --> 02:30:32.475]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.475 --> 02:30:36.155]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.155 --> 02:30:36.935]  Number 5.
[02:30:36.935 --> 02:30:41.096]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.096 --> 02:30:46.137]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.137 --> 02:30:50.318]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:03.163 --> 02:31:06.946]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:31:06.946 --> 02:31:09.828]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:31:09.828 --> 02:31:14.751]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[02:32:04.156 --> 02:32:05.417]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.417 --> 02:32:09.339]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.339 --> 02:32:11.741]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:11.741 --> 02:32:17.444]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:17.444 --> 02:32:23.688]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.108 --> 02:32:30.092]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.092 --> 02:32:34.255]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.255 --> 02:32:38.558]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:38.558 --> 02:32:44.502]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.502 --> 02:32:48.065]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.065 --> 02:32:50.046]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.046 --> 02:32:50.487]  It's here.
[02:32:51.127 --> 02:32:57.609]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com, or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:57.609 --> 02:33:16.154]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to land.
[02:33:16.154 --> 02:33:20.515]  You win some, lose some, and do the same to me.
[02:33:31.524 --> 02:33:33.465]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:33.465 --> 02:33:37.347]  Remember, this radio broadcast is funded by you.
[02:33:37.347 --> 02:33:40.148]  Spreading the word about the broadcast, that's the main mission.
[02:33:40.148 --> 02:33:43.469]  Reaching new people, shattering the left-right paradigm.
[02:33:43.469 --> 02:33:46.411]  People are in the controlled left or controlled right.
[02:33:46.411 --> 02:33:55.095]  Once they really hear the truth historically, once they see the globalist-owned statements, once they see the information covered in my films, in my books,
[02:33:55.635 --> 02:34:08.546]  They awaken the power of the Obama deception being seen now more than 30 million times in the last year and a half shattering the left-right paradigm is everywhere.
[02:34:08.546 --> 02:34:12.869]  The power of all the Republic being seen close to 10 million times for free.
[02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:19.115]  And that's just on the web, not counting the hundreds of thousands of people that have been given hard copies.
[02:34:19.115 --> 02:34:24.639]  Please buy Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined.
[02:34:24.639 --> 02:34:25.820]  Make copies of them.
[02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:27.181]  Give them to everyone you know.
[02:34:27.181 --> 02:34:29.704]  And when they see it, they will know the truth.
[02:34:29.704 --> 02:34:34.407]  They will see the globalist's own documents, their own statements, where they explain their program.
[02:34:34.407 --> 02:34:35.869]  They think you're stupid.
[02:34:35.869 --> 02:34:39.532]  They think you won't go research their own statements, so they communicate with each other in public.
[02:34:39.972 --> 02:34:42.477]  Like Brzezinski saying, look, we're in trouble.
[02:34:42.477 --> 02:34:46.525]  The New World Order now has global resistance like it's never had.
[02:34:46.525 --> 02:34:48.008]  There is a worldwide awakening.
[02:34:49.602 --> 02:34:50.662]  But they're counter-striking.
[02:34:50.662 --> 02:34:52.023]  We've got to accelerate that.
[02:34:52.023 --> 02:35:02.265]  I mean, here's a clip from Fox News yesterday, or actually this morning, where they're talking to two former Obama supporters, and they say, I've shattered the left-right paradigm.
[02:35:02.265 --> 02:35:03.685]  I've woken up to this.
[02:35:03.685 --> 02:35:06.986]  The same bankers that ran Bush run Obama.
[02:35:06.986 --> 02:35:08.687]  This is a takeover.
[02:35:08.687 --> 02:35:12.968]  They finally are getting it everywhere, and the system doesn't know what to do.
[02:35:12.968 --> 02:35:18.429]  And so, Gallup and others have major reports out this week that just came out over the weekend saying, look,
[02:35:19.721 --> 02:35:21.602]  And the Republican Party leadership's talking about this.
[02:35:21.602 --> 02:35:30.567]  They said, look, Republicans are going to get into power, but they're going to instantly be removed if they don't stop all the banker bailouts and all the corruption.
[02:35:30.567 --> 02:35:33.749]  And the people are awake.
[02:35:34.864 --> 02:35:38.207]  And so anti-incumbent Democrats are winning in primaries.
[02:35:38.207 --> 02:35:45.615]  Anti-incumbent Republicans are beating all the Republicans, in every case but Rick Perry, in scores of cases.
[02:35:45.615 --> 02:35:47.797]  The system is in deep trouble.
[02:35:47.797 --> 02:35:49.199]  That's why they want to start World War III.
[02:35:49.199 --> 02:35:56.366]  I want to get into a bunch of news, but first, here is a short clip from Fox Television today.
[02:35:56.366 --> 02:35:57.527]  What kind of hope and change?
[02:35:58.496 --> 02:35:58.876]  Go ahead.
[02:35:58.876 --> 02:36:02.259]  With regard to the job market, Tatiana, did you expect?
[02:36:02.259 --> 02:36:08.604]  I expected way more change, but now doing the research I realize that Obama is an illusion of change.
[02:36:08.604 --> 02:36:15.090]  He's a lot like Bush in many ways, and he's a lot like Bush in many ways.
[02:36:15.090 --> 02:36:15.750]  In what way?
[02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:18.573]  It's a fallacy to actually believe that he cares.
[02:36:21.072 --> 02:36:21.212]  I don't
[02:36:39.245 --> 02:36:41.987]  For the poor and the working class of this nation.
[02:36:41.987 --> 02:36:49.553]  But I'm not so much disappointed in Obama, I'm also disappointed with the Republicans and the American citizens.
[02:36:49.553 --> 02:36:59.480]  Far too many Americans keep falling for this left-right paradigm when the power structure at the top of both parties is corrupt.
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:03.523]  They're both sold to the bankers and the corporate interests.
[02:37:03.643 --> 02:37:10.708]  Okay, Mike, I know that one thing that really troubled you was that it started to dawn on you that maybe the young people actually will be in pain.
[02:37:10.708 --> 02:37:12.069]  So it's everywhere.
[02:37:12.069 --> 02:37:13.990]  The awakening is just massive.
[02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:15.672]  By the way, we didn't edit that video.
[02:37:15.672 --> 02:37:19.294]  We were streaming it live from Fox's website and it was cutting out.
[02:37:19.294 --> 02:37:20.916]  But it's just everywhere.
[02:37:21.756 --> 02:37:26.821]  It's everywhere that this awakening is taking place and it's game over.
[02:37:26.821 --> 02:37:44.959]  When you realize there's an ultra powerful criminal cartel of private corporations that don't like the free market, that don't like you owning your own business, that don't like you owning your own restaurant or your own farm or ranch, that don't want you owning your own record label, that don't want you owning your own
[02:37:45.399 --> 02:37:46.760]  Firearms company.
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:55.287]  When you realize they're monopoly men and that competition is a sin to them, as the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said, it's game over.
[02:37:55.287 --> 02:38:05.115]  The moment people actually get it and realize we have this shadowy corporate elite, represented by the Bilderbergs, the CFR, and others, it's over!
[02:38:05.115 --> 02:38:09.759]  And that's what Ron Paul has said, and I agree with him, that once you identify the Federal Reserve,
[02:38:10.757 --> 02:38:17.392]  As a private criminal group, they can get their kept Congress that they own.
[02:38:17.392 --> 02:38:20.498]  They can have them give them more power, but it's short-lived.
[02:38:22.108 --> 02:38:25.310]  As they try to pass laws saying they're allowed to steal money.
[02:38:25.310 --> 02:38:30.173]  Well, they pass laws saying black people weren't humans, but folks stood up against that.
[02:38:30.173 --> 02:38:37.937]  They can pass a law saying I've got to worship the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, but it doesn't mean I have to worship the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
[02:38:37.937 --> 02:38:43.140]  There are innate, organic, common sense laws to the universe, and innate
[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:44.301]  We're good to go.
[02:38:59.824 --> 02:39:02.346]  She's got it, and we're seeing this everywhere.
[02:39:02.346 --> 02:39:05.268]  It's explosive, and the system has the NSA.
[02:39:05.268 --> 02:39:07.169]  They have the tracking and surveillance.
[02:39:07.169 --> 02:39:14.114]  They knew the effect this radio show, my films, and the websites were having years ago before we even realized it.
[02:39:14.114 --> 02:39:18.557]  I mean, I knew we were having a big effect, but folks, now I literally can't walk my dog.
[02:39:18.557 --> 02:39:19.878]  I can't go in a restaurant.
[02:39:19.878 --> 02:39:21.139]  I can fly anywhere in the country.
[02:39:21.619 --> 02:39:27.181]  I can go anywhere and cars stop on the road and two, three or four of them will back up.
[02:39:27.181 --> 02:39:31.883]  Every time I see police in Austin, they run over and say, we're awake, we know it's all true.
[02:39:31.883 --> 02:39:35.505]  You told us about world government and now it's admitted.
[02:39:35.505 --> 02:39:43.468]  All because I stood for the truth and I continued to just lay out the facts.
[02:39:43.468 --> 02:39:46.389]  I continued to tell the truth and didn't care if people made fun of me.
[02:39:47.222 --> 02:39:48.723]  And then it came true.
[02:39:48.723 --> 02:39:52.384]  Everything we talked about began to unfold.
[02:39:52.384 --> 02:40:04.168]  And black people, Democrats, cops, Hispanics, white folks, farmers, it doesn't matter, they're all starting to really figure out how the world really works.
[02:40:04.168 --> 02:40:06.449]  The hoax, the illusion is disappearing.
[02:40:06.449 --> 02:40:07.330]  I'm nothing special.
[02:40:07.330 --> 02:40:10.011]  It's like the emperor's new clothes.
[02:40:10.011 --> 02:40:12.091]  The emperor, if you read the fable, it's fiction.
[02:40:14.815 --> 02:40:16.877]  It's a allegory for life.
[02:40:16.877 --> 02:40:21.661]  For those that don't know the story, I'll briefly tell it, and then I'm gonna get into the news and your calls.
[02:40:21.661 --> 02:40:38.216]  The emperor had these con artists come to town, and they said, we're going to weave you a beautiful cloak of gold, but it's so beautiful that only the upright and intelligent and genius can see the cloak.
[02:40:40.632 --> 02:40:46.917]  And the emperor got called in, he paid all this money, all these jewels for it, and they said, here is your cloak.
[02:40:46.917 --> 02:40:57.226]  And he didn't see anything, but he didn't want to admit that he was profane, that he was dumb, that he wasn't enlightened, because only the enlightened could see the beautiful coat.
[02:40:57.226 --> 02:40:58.387]  And I'm paraphrasing the story.
[02:40:58.387 --> 02:41:02.350]  Guys, will you pull up the actual parable of the emperor's new clothes?
[02:41:02.350 --> 02:41:04.712]  Maybe we should link to it on InfoWars.com.
[02:41:04.712 --> 02:41:06.394]  The point is, is that
[02:41:07.489 --> 02:41:15.638]  Then they sold him several other cloaks, underwear, pants, his undershirt, and then he had a parade a few months later totally naked.
[02:41:15.638 --> 02:41:18.962]  But none of his advisors wanted to admit he was naked and get in trouble.
[02:41:18.962 --> 02:41:22.686]  Nobody wanted to be the first person to wonder why he was naked.
[02:41:22.686 --> 02:41:23.667]  So in plain view,
[02:41:24.548 --> 02:41:32.451]  He was walking through the city square at a parade and a two-year-old boy stepped forward and laughed and said, the emperor is naked.
[02:41:32.451 --> 02:41:34.412]  The emperor is wearing no clothes.
[02:41:34.412 --> 02:41:36.452]  And then everyone else started laughing.
[02:41:36.452 --> 02:41:37.953]  Everyone else started pointing.
[02:41:37.953 --> 02:41:40.974]  And he turned red and got embarrassed and ran back inside.
[02:41:40.974 --> 02:41:42.855]  And I'm like the two-year-old.
[02:41:42.855 --> 02:41:45.256]  They're in the news telling us torture's good.
[02:41:45.256 --> 02:41:46.816]  Then they get caught doing it.
[02:41:46.816 --> 02:41:49.177]  Then they indict the people they ordered to do it.
[02:41:49.177 --> 02:41:51.998]  Then Bush comes out and says he ordered it and would order it again.
[02:41:51.998 --> 02:41:53.559]  But they sent people to prison that did it.
[02:41:54.773 --> 02:42:00.321]  They're giving people vaccines that are causing convulsions and brain damage admittedly everywhere, a tenfold increase.
[02:42:00.321 --> 02:42:04.687]  It's an admitted fraud, but they're back with the emperor's clothes again.
[02:42:04.687 --> 02:42:06.930]  And more of us are pointing out it's a fraud.
[02:42:06.930 --> 02:42:09.153]  They lied about WMDs.
[02:42:09.153 --> 02:42:10.915]  They're back lying about Iran again.
[02:42:11.576 --> 02:42:15.780]  They lied to us about GMO food being good for us when every study shows it's deadly.
[02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:20.405]  They told us Prozac stops suicide when they now admitted increases suicide.
[02:42:20.405 --> 02:42:22.727]  They lied to us and said big government was good.
[02:42:22.727 --> 02:42:26.571]  They lied to us and said they weren't taking baby's blood at birth 38 years ago.
[02:42:26.571 --> 02:42:28.213]  Now it's admitted they have been secretly.
[02:42:29.551 --> 02:42:37.357]  They told us getting rid of Glass-Steagall Act wouldn't hurt the economy, and that the banks wouldn't sell derivatives, and they did, and destroyed the economy.
[02:42:37.357 --> 02:42:39.899]  They told us NAFTA and GATT was going to be great.
[02:42:39.899 --> 02:42:44.142]  It's so simple when you have a historical context.
[02:42:44.142 --> 02:42:53.769]  If you are as informed about history and society, then it's incredibly entertaining, incredibly addictive, incredibly riveting.
[02:42:53.769 --> 02:42:57.932]  The real world's... Truth is stranger than fiction, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:57.932 --> 02:42:58.613]  It's a lot more
[02:43:00.717 --> 02:43:04.204]  It's a lot more interesting.
[02:43:04.204 --> 02:43:05.366]  Gosh, can somebody get me a water?
[02:43:05.366 --> 02:43:06.488]  My throat's really dry, thank you.
[02:43:08.385 --> 02:43:21.509]  It is, thank you, it is a lot more interesting to truly be involved and informed, and have your knowledge exponentially increase, and know how things work, and know how people work, and know how society operates.
[02:43:21.509 --> 02:43:27.551]  Because once you do, you realize most people are still completely blind, unconscious, don't know what's going on.
[02:43:27.551 --> 02:43:36.154]  And then, instead of being like the globalists, using the fact that they're in the dark to control them, and to manipulate them for your own gain, that's what evil does,
[02:43:36.894 --> 02:43:39.896]  To take blinders off people's eyes, off their souls.
[02:43:39.896 --> 02:43:49.462]  To see them expand their awakening and understanding like a seed sprouting and growing into a mighty oak tree.
[02:43:49.462 --> 02:43:54.466]  To see the effect I've had in 15 years and the effect that others that came before me had.
[02:43:54.466 --> 02:44:00.530]  To realize the innate power of the individual is so wondrous and a blessing from God.
[02:44:00.530 --> 02:44:02.191]  All right, I'm done.
[02:44:02.191 --> 02:44:03.432]  I've gotta hurry now.
[02:44:03.432 --> 02:44:04.673]  Giant stack of news.
[02:44:05.666 --> 02:44:10.748]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, when I get to this mosque news, we'll be playing the video in the background.
[02:44:10.748 --> 02:44:13.309]  If not, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:13.309 --> 02:44:14.089]  But let me go through the news.
[02:44:14.089 --> 02:44:15.250]  Some of this I've already covered.
[02:44:15.250 --> 02:44:16.350]  Much of it I haven't.
[02:44:16.350 --> 02:44:19.651]  Philly requiring bloggers to pay $300 for a business license.
[02:44:19.651 --> 02:44:21.632]  They say it's a privilege to have a website.
[02:44:21.632 --> 02:44:23.733]  You've got to pay $300 for the right to your free speech.
[02:44:25.575 --> 02:44:26.635]  Talk about arrogance.
[02:44:26.635 --> 02:44:28.076]  Emperor's New Clothes.
[02:44:28.076 --> 02:44:29.717]  Naked bodies scanning our children.
[02:44:29.717 --> 02:44:31.478]  Lying about saving the images.
[02:44:31.478 --> 02:44:33.518]  The Emperor's New Clothes.
[02:44:33.518 --> 02:44:34.799]  It's asinine.
[02:44:34.799 --> 02:44:36.320]  Toxic legacy of U.S.
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:37.400]  assault on Fallujah.
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:38.741]  Worse than Hiroshima.
[02:44:38.741 --> 02:44:39.841]  London independent.
[02:44:39.841 --> 02:44:43.383]  The shocking rates of infant mortality and cancer in Iraqi city.
[02:44:43.383 --> 02:44:44.903]  This is just one city they studied.
[02:44:44.903 --> 02:44:46.284]  Raise new questions about battle.
[02:44:47.537 --> 02:44:58.292]  And it goes on to say the major study has been conducted and they found a four-fold increase in all cancers and a 12-fold increase in childhood cancers in under 14s.
[02:44:58.292 --> 02:45:00.114]  A 12-fold increase.
[02:45:00.114 --> 02:45:03.739]  Dramatic increases in infant mortality, cancer, leukemia in the Iraqi city of Fallujah.
[02:45:04.909 --> 02:45:12.615]  Which was bombarded by Marines in 04, exceed those reports by survivors of the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 45.
[02:45:12.615 --> 02:45:21.962]  According to a new study, Iraqi doctors in Fallujah have compiled, since 2005, we have other US studies by the way, of being overwhelmed by the number of babies with serious birth defects.
[02:45:21.962 --> 02:45:23.764]  And they've put them on the news.
[02:45:23.764 --> 02:45:27.227]  Ranging from a girl born with two heads to paralysis of the lower limbs.
[02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:33.704]  They said that they were also seeing far worse cancers than they did before the Battle of Fallujah between U.S.
[02:45:33.704 --> 02:45:36.386]  troops and insurgents.
[02:45:36.386 --> 02:45:46.774]  Dr. Chris Busby, visiting professor of University of Ulster, and one of the authors of the survey of 4,100 individuals in Fallujah, said it's difficult to pin down the exact cause of the cancers and birth defects.
[02:45:46.774 --> 02:45:55.341]  He added that to produce effects like this, some maryvager mutagenic exposure must have occurred in 04 when the attacks happened.
[02:45:55.341 --> 02:45:58.023]  And then it goes into all the DU that was used.
[02:46:00.382 --> 02:46:01.482]  Okay, continuing here.
[02:46:01.482 --> 02:46:09.166]  I think the AC is off in this office.
[02:46:09.166 --> 02:46:10.346]  Let me get into this report.
[02:46:10.346 --> 02:46:17.089]  I'm going to do a larger YouTube video on this today, but Adderall may have unhinged Lindsay Lohan.
[02:46:17.089 --> 02:46:19.870]  And in every one of these different cases that I've seen,
[02:46:22.318 --> 02:46:35.986]  Time and time again, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Britney Spears or mass shooters, they're always on serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are in the hallucinogen psychotropic class.
[02:46:35.986 --> 02:46:38.407]  And it makes people do crazy things.
[02:46:38.407 --> 02:46:40.588]  That's admitted what it does.
[02:46:40.588 --> 02:46:42.769]  And it destroys inhibition.
[02:46:42.769 --> 02:46:44.970]  It makes people much more promiscuous.
[02:46:44.970 --> 02:46:47.112]  It makes people much more reckless.
[02:46:47.112 --> 02:46:51.034]  And in every case we look at, these people are hopped up on pharmacological drugs.
[02:46:53.055 --> 02:47:08.378]  As we first reported, the docs at the UCLA Rehab Facility believe Lindsey was misdiagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and was prescribed Adderall, that's a type of speed, to treat the phantom affliction, which again, speed also makes you nuts.
[02:47:08.378 --> 02:47:20.120]  Dr. Joe Harazi, a prominent LA addiction specialist, tells TMZ people who take Adderall when they don't need it can experience similar effects to people who use cocaine or methamphetamine.
[02:47:21.226 --> 02:47:29.050]  Bottom line, a bad medical diagnosis may have set the ball rolling that unhinged Lindsay Lohan's life.
[02:47:29.050 --> 02:47:31.832]  The wreckage of these synthetic drugs they push.
[02:47:31.832 --> 02:47:34.874]  I mean, you take hillbilly heroin that Rush Limbaugh was on.
[02:47:34.874 --> 02:47:37.996]  Every study shows far worse than real heroin.
[02:47:37.996 --> 02:47:38.976]  But they push it.
[02:47:38.976 --> 02:47:41.077]  You have a sprained leg, got a hurt back?
[02:47:41.077 --> 02:47:43.719]  Oh, here, have some pills that totally addict you.
[02:47:46.101 --> 02:47:49.402]  Here's another one out of the Deccan Herald.
[02:47:49.402 --> 02:47:52.643]  Five out of six new drugs don't work.
[02:47:52.643 --> 02:47:58.545]  Five out of six approved prescription drugs seldom benefit patients, says a critic of the pharmacological industry.
[02:47:58.545 --> 02:48:10.069]  And then it breaks down all these major university heads, University of Medicine, New Jersey, going over all the information about statins attacking the liver, not lowering cholesterol, all these other bad drugs.
[02:48:11.749 --> 02:48:13.310]  Here's another one on the similar study.
[02:48:13.310 --> 02:48:19.572]  A new study, 85% of big pharma's new drugs are lemons and pose health risk to users, just like the swine flu shot.
[02:48:19.572 --> 02:48:22.073]  But they don't care, they're back pushing it again this year.
[02:48:22.073 --> 02:48:23.753]  They have no shame.
[02:48:23.753 --> 02:48:25.874]  They just operate in plain view.
[02:48:25.874 --> 02:48:32.317]  For years, natural health proponents have been sounding the alarms about the dangers of the new drugs that were pushed on consumers.
[02:48:32.317 --> 02:48:35.598]  But is that one-sided, inaccurate view?
[02:48:35.598 --> 02:48:37.139]  Not at all.
[02:48:37.139 --> 02:48:38.079]  And it goes on to say,
[02:48:39.781 --> 02:48:43.024]  In fact, far worse than most people have ever dreamed.
[02:48:43.024 --> 02:48:51.172]  Independent reviewers found that about 85% of new drugs offer few, if any, benefits, but carry the risk of causing serious harm to users.
[02:48:51.172 --> 02:49:03.523]  According to Donald Light, Ph.D., Professor of Comparative Health, Policy, University of Medicine, New Jersey, who authored the study, Pharmacological Industry is a Market for Lemons, and it goes over all of that.
[02:49:03.523 --> 02:49:04.564]  But the issue here
[02:49:05.712 --> 02:49:06.993]  Is that it's worse than that.
[02:49:06.993 --> 02:49:07.953]  They're not just lemons.
[02:49:07.953 --> 02:49:10.215]  They know it's hurting you.
[02:49:10.215 --> 02:49:18.319]  They know, on the insert for Gardasil, that it doesn't protect you from human papillomavirus that reportedly can cause cervical cancer.
[02:49:18.319 --> 02:49:20.761]  They admit it doesn't help you.
[02:49:20.761 --> 02:49:24.423]  They admit and know that fluoride doesn't make your teeth stronger.
[02:49:24.423 --> 02:49:28.025]  The American Dental Association now admitted that five years ago.
[02:49:28.025 --> 02:49:30.126]  They know all of this.
[02:49:32.145 --> 02:49:34.586]  They knew H1N1 was a hoax.
[02:49:34.586 --> 02:49:38.049]  They understand it.
[02:49:38.049 --> 02:49:40.170]  Now we're going to break, but I want to start getting into this now.
[02:49:40.170 --> 02:49:42.251]  Key article, and I'll show some of the video.
[02:49:42.251 --> 02:49:47.134]  Black construction worker chased away from Ground Zero by craved mob.
[02:49:47.134 --> 02:49:48.595]  The guy was not even a Muslim.
[02:49:48.595 --> 02:49:52.317]  He told them, we can't play the video, there's so many cuss words, them cussing at him.
[02:49:52.317 --> 02:49:55.119]  And this crowd is screaming at him.
[02:49:55.119 --> 02:49:56.460]  And he's saying, I'm not even a Muslim.
[02:49:56.460 --> 02:49:58.841]  He's wearing an American flag pendant around his neck.
[02:49:58.841 --> 02:50:00.422]  They said, well, you got that white hat on.
[02:50:00.422 --> 02:50:01.483]  He says, well,
[02:50:02.481 --> 02:50:03.422]  It's hot out here.
[02:50:03.422 --> 02:50:07.404]  This is so sweat doesn't drip in my eye when I'm welding.
[02:50:07.404 --> 02:50:18.291]  So he comes walking off Ground Zero as a construction worker, and by the end of it, they end up screaming and yelling and basically chasing him out of there, saying, get out of here, Muslim, get out of here, Muslim.
[02:50:18.291 --> 02:50:19.792]  Well, so what if he was a Muslim?
[02:50:19.792 --> 02:50:22.734]  Is this what America has become?
[02:50:22.734 --> 02:50:27.237]  Where, oh, you're black, and you're wearing an American flag necklace, you must be a Muslim?
[02:50:27.237 --> 02:50:28.638]  We're gonna chase you out of here?
[02:50:30.256 --> 02:50:33.757]  And my note on Matt Ryan's article boils it down.
[02:50:33.757 --> 02:50:35.237]  This is an important issue.
[02:50:35.237 --> 02:50:43.420]  It has now come out that the co-owner of the mosque project is a co-owner of Fox News.
[02:50:43.420 --> 02:50:44.440]  Again, this is an important issue.
[02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:49.581]  It has now come out that the co-owner of Fox News is the main financier of the proposed mosque.
[02:50:49.581 --> 02:50:53.242]  The mosque imam is hooked in with the CFR and other top global organizations.
[02:50:53.242 --> 02:50:54.563]  The evidence is conclusive.
[02:50:54.563 --> 02:50:56.703]  This is a divide and conquer operation.
[02:50:56.703 --> 02:50:59.404]  We'll be right back with more news blitz straight ahead.
[02:51:03.243 --> 02:51:04.464]  This is not a drill.
[02:51:04.464 --> 02:51:06.966]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:51:06.966 --> 02:51:08.868]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:51:08.868 --> 02:51:16.093]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:51:16.093 --> 02:51:20.477]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:51:20.477 --> 02:51:30.745]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:51:30.965 --> 02:51:32.606]  Under any circumstance.
[02:51:32.606 --> 02:51:39.828]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:51:39.828 --> 02:51:40.549]  But listen up.
[02:51:40.549 --> 02:51:46.771]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:51:46.771 --> 02:51:48.612]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:51:48.612 --> 02:51:50.773]  That's hideyourguns.com.

[02:52:09.002 --> 02:52:14.108]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.108 --> 02:52:18.313]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.613 --> 02:52:20.976]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.976 --> 02:52:23.860]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.860 --> 02:52:26.764]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.764 --> 02:52:34.374]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.693 --> 02:52:40.098]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.098 --> 02:52:42.960]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:46.643]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.643 --> 02:52:47.704]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.704 --> 02:52:49.045]  You're everyone else.

[02:53:48.408 --> 02:53:49.689]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[02:53:49.689 --> 02:53:50.490]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:53:50.490 --> 02:53:51.431]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:24.909 --> 02:54:31.496]  So, integrated in with this story, black construction worker chased away from Ground Zero by crazed mob.
[02:54:31.496 --> 02:54:33.438]  We have the other report by Steve Watson.
[02:54:33.438 --> 02:54:36.701]  Ground Zero mosque imam is globalist stooge.
[02:54:36.701 --> 02:54:45.670]  And one of his biggest funders, giving him $305,000, the imam running this whole thing, funding this imam, is the second biggest owner of News Corp.
[02:54:46.431 --> 02:54:47.512]  Amazing.
[02:54:47.512 --> 02:54:49.754]  Continuing, Calderon says U.S.
[02:54:49.754 --> 02:54:52.857]  arms drive is driving drug violence.
[02:54:52.857 --> 02:54:57.281]  Meanwhile, their own police just kidnapped and killed a mayor in a major city down there.
[02:54:57.281 --> 02:55:08.511]  So their government's totally corrupt, telling us what to do, and now they're reporting that they are going to send Mexican consulate and police to stop hate crimes against Mexicans in New York City.
[02:55:09.051 --> 02:55:11.374]  Are we going to send our police down there when U.S.
[02:55:11.374 --> 02:55:14.979]  citizens are getting kidnapped by the Mexican police and shaken down?
[02:55:14.979 --> 02:55:16.081]  Here's another one.
[02:55:16.081 --> 02:55:22.490]  Arizona Sheriff, Border Patrol has retreated from parts of the border because it's too dangerous.
[02:55:22.490 --> 02:55:23.431]  Cyber News Service.
[02:55:24.412 --> 02:55:27.274]  We can't even have our border patrol on some areas of the border.
[02:55:27.274 --> 02:55:30.916]  They're telling citizens don't go in certain national parks or down certain roads.
[02:55:30.916 --> 02:55:32.677]  They've got big signs up about it.
[02:55:32.677 --> 02:55:38.541]  But we've got the Mexican government telling us what to do here in the United States with our Second Amendment.
[02:55:38.541 --> 02:55:39.242]  Absolutely...
[02:55:40.771 --> 02:55:42.513]  Incredible on that front.
[02:55:42.513 --> 02:55:46.696]  On another Second Amendment issue, Opposing Views has this story.
[02:55:46.696 --> 02:55:50.059]  Obama bans more than 100,000 American-made rifles.
[02:55:50.059 --> 02:55:56.044]  You know that program of decommissioned rifles used in World War II and Korea?
[02:55:56.044 --> 02:55:57.685]  They've already tried to ban those.
[02:55:57.685 --> 02:56:03.490]  Well now, according to the Korea Times, the Obama administration has blocked efforts by the South Korean government to sell over 100,000 surplus N1 gram
[02:56:06.232 --> 02:56:07.233]  We're good to go.
[02:56:32.503 --> 02:56:34.063]  Look at this whole group of reports.
[02:56:34.063 --> 02:56:40.805]  In 1992, John Holdren publication reaffirms devotion to population control through global effort.
[02:56:40.805 --> 02:56:43.546]  So he said it in 2006.
[02:56:43.546 --> 02:56:51.248]  1992, he said, oh, ignore that stuff I wrote in Ecoscience from the 70s, calling for a global government and putting stuff in the water to sterilize you.
[02:56:51.248 --> 02:56:52.389]  But he's back promoting it.
[02:56:53.229 --> 02:57:02.576]  Also, BBC is having a special they're promoting where they're looking at sterilizing, quote, people who are morally unfit.
[02:57:02.576 --> 02:57:07.419]  If you've had a history of crime, mental illness or handicap, they now want to sterilize you.
[02:57:07.419 --> 02:57:14.464]  The headline is, good enough for Hitler, professors to debate sterilizing mentally and morally unfit on BBC radio.
[02:57:14.464 --> 02:57:17.327]  And that integrates in with this InfoWars.com article.
[02:57:18.007 --> 02:57:24.028]  Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction to have steroids added to vaccines.
[02:57:24.028 --> 02:57:25.968]  This was in the mid-1960s.
[02:57:25.968 --> 02:57:27.469]  You'll want to read that report.
[02:57:27.469 --> 02:57:29.909]  Here's another one, Mail Online.
[02:57:29.909 --> 02:57:35.350]  The facial recognition software that will put a name to every photograph in the internet.
[02:57:35.350 --> 02:57:47.572]  They plan to scour the web for all photographs of individuals and do face scan databases of where you are and what you've been doing to control everybody and track everyone on the social networks.
[02:57:50.365 --> 02:57:50.785]  Amazing.
[02:57:50.785 --> 02:57:51.386]  Here's another one.
[02:57:51.386 --> 02:57:56.650]  Officials unveil high-tech ray to be installed in county jail.
[02:57:56.650 --> 02:58:06.718]  A high-tech ray gun built to the military that fires an invisible heat beam capable of causing unbearable pain will be tested on unruly inmates in the sheriff's detention facility.
[02:58:06.718 --> 02:58:08.920]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:10.501]  Gosh, I gotta cover that more tomorrow.
[02:58:10.501 --> 02:58:11.402]  That is so incredible.
[02:58:11.402 --> 02:58:12.783]  I hadn't even seen this.
[02:58:12.783 --> 02:58:14.544]  Somebody just put this in my stack.
[02:58:14.544 --> 02:58:15.945]  And here's another one I meant to get to.
[02:58:15.945 --> 02:58:18.507]  I'll cover this more tomorrow in the first hour.
[02:58:19.608 --> 02:58:24.953]  It says, uh, Carver's Bay Enlist 9th Grade.
[02:58:24.953 --> 02:58:28.575]  Freshmen all put in ROTC.
[02:58:28.575 --> 02:58:36.222]  All of the children are to be put in the military as part of the recruiting, and they're going in and recruiting them and trying to trick them to sign enlistment.
[02:58:36.222 --> 02:58:38.864]  The entire school, this is spreading nationwide.
[02:58:38.864 --> 02:58:39.785]  It's unbelievable.
