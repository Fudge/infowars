[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:02.330]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:11.194]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.757]  Max Kaiser is our guest.
[00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:27.340]  He has two different international television programs on RT and Press TV.
[00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:34.516]  He is a TV presenter, radio host, entrepreneur, broadcaster, and journalist.
[00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:40.438]  He is the inventor of the virtual specialist technology, prediction markets, Hollywood Stock Exchange, and much more.
[00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:49.121]  He is the presenter of Oracle, BBC, Al Jazeera, Huffington Post, you name it.
[00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:53.626]  And we appreciate him joining us, former Wall Street broker.
[00:00:53.666 --> 00:01:00.508]  You know, he's been saying for years that Goldman Sachs is engineering financial collapse to consolidate and destroy their competition.
[00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:03.728]  Now that is mainstream news.
[00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:04.709]  Here's the London Guardian.
[00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.009]  Now we know the truth.
[00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.430]  The financial meltdown wasn't a mistake.
[00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.850]  It was a con.
[00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:18.715]  And we have record bonuses now to be paid to Goldman Sachs, just in England, 3.5 billion pounds.
[00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:30.038]  And of course you notice the inner group, JPMorgan Chase and other groups that own the private Federal Reserve holding company, they're all making record profits while hoarding all the bailout money.
[00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.980]  And why has the SEC indicted Goldman Sachs, some of their members,
[00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:36.581]  Civilly.
[00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:42.423]  Well, they'll probably give him a $5 million fine and slap him on the wrist and give somebody probation for the trillions that have been stolen.
[00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:45.344]  But joining us is Max Keiser to discuss this.
[00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:49.646]  We'll also get into the FBI saying the number one threat is us, the American people.
[00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:57.469]  Bill Clinton says, you know, if the Tea Parties don't shut up, people don't criticize Wall Street, that a terror attack is going to happen and it's our fault.
[00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.970]  I mean, they're out in the open, folks, getting ready to stage terror attacks here.
[00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:03.451]  And we'll take your calls on that subject.
[00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.052]  Max Keiser, good to have you here with us.
[00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:08.455]  Yeah, Alex Jones, it's always a pleasure.
[00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:11.276]  Well, I tell you, things are getting crazy.
[00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:14.497]  Let's get into Goldman Sachs and financial terrorism.
[00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:16.517]  Right.
[00:02:16.697 --> 00:02:20.778]  Well, as you point out, I've been talking about this for a number of years.
[00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:33.941]  Basically, they have been involved, as have other Wall Street banks, in setting up banks to fail because they can profit on the failure.
[00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:45.257]  So, just like we've talked about before about Building 7, during the 9-11 incident, there were many options traders that made a lot of money because the Building 7 collapsed.
[00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:47.837]  Now, here's Goldman Sachs, same thing.
[00:02:48.157 --> 00:02:59.039]  They create a fund, they create bonds that they build to collapse, that they rig with financial dynamite so that it collapses, and they make money on the collapse.
[00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.099]  It's financial terrorism.
[00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.520]  It's a controlled demolition.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.300]  That's how they make a lot of their money.
[00:03:07.612 --> 00:03:08.844]  That's how they make most of their money.
[00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:15.907]  Well, there's no doubt that the stimulus has run out and now they're saying, OK, maybe it is a depression.
[00:03:15.947 --> 00:03:16.848]  We need more money.
[00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:33.879]  Obama's new regulation package allows the top banks and brokerage firms to, through their regulators that they control, to basically feed other smaller regional healthy banks into their maw and a tax on smaller institutions that's paid through bailout money to them.
[00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.923]  I mean, this is, we've got Gordon Brown calling for a world government of and for and by the banks.
[00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:40.764]  I mean, it's just getting crazy.
[00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:49.449]  Well, you know, it's interesting because Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, of course, famously said that he was doing God's work.
[00:03:50.938 --> 00:04:07.635]  When he and his cohorts are creating all of these problems for everybody and creating blackmail situations and extortion to get their buddy Hank Paulson to extort $700 billion, if you recall, back there at the end of 2008 in front of Congress.
[00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:13.040]  But apparently he's angered the gods because now in Iceland the volcano is blowing up.
[00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:21.601]  And what's remarkable, Alex, is that this is similar to almost exactly what happened during the French Revolution.
[00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:25.186]  Actually, the French Revolution started when a volcano in Iceland blew up.
[00:04:25.727 --> 00:04:28.370]  It caused global problems with agriculture.
[00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:31.754]  And this was the... You know what?
[00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:32.295]  You know what?
[00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.818]  I mean, it's like a comet being a portent of doom.
[00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:42.286]  It's like God was showing people the Earth freezing solid, basically, right as they tried to pass their global warming takeover.
[00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:43.527]  Now you're right.
[00:04:43.587 --> 00:04:44.929]  I'd forgotten that historically.
[00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:48.633]  Mega volcano shrouding Europe in dust.
[00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:49.074]  Stay there.
[00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:51.888]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:57.274]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:04:57.514 --> 00:05:02.140]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:07.587]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:12.811]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:20.257]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:20.437 --> 00:05:21.338]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:21.558 --> 00:05:27.923]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:31.085]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:33.306]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:34.566]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:34.766]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:37.748]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:38.228 --> 00:05:39.969]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.820]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:04.281]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:09.062]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:20.444]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:21.084 --> 00:06:30.107]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:30.607 --> 00:06:35.649]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:43.212]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:43.512 --> 00:06:46.273]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:54.264 --> 00:06:55.184]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:59.006]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:59.446 --> 00:07:01.687]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:01.868 --> 00:07:07.130]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:13.793]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:19.797]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:20.217 --> 00:07:23.899]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.342]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:34.606]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:37.528]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:38.188 --> 00:07:39.609]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.590]  It's here.

[00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:56.159]  Big Brother.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.861]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:58.601 --> 00:07:59.743]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:59.763 --> 00:08:01.184]  You want answers?
[00:08:01.945 --> 00:08:03.427]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:03.487 --> 00:08:07.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:11.756]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:39.791]  Well, the first two hours were dedicated to the fact that it's 100% the military-industrial complex that controls both parties is going to stage a terror attack to blame it on people that want to end the Fed, people that want to audit the Fed, that want to arrest the people that run Goldman Sachs, that controlled all the regulatory positions, and aren't just ripping our country off, they're ripping off countries from Chile to New Zealand to Greece to Iceland.
[00:08:41.078 --> 00:08:42.900]  And they've been building this propaganda up.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.882]  They claim the Tea Parties are right-wing.
[00:08:45.123 --> 00:08:47.565]  It becomes a self-fulfilling Republican prophecy.
[00:08:48.126 --> 00:08:53.992]  Then they began demonizing those when polls show 40% of the Tea Parties are Democrats and Independents.
[00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:55.554]  It's divide and conquer.
[00:08:55.654 --> 00:08:57.677]  Oh, you want a populist movement against what we're doing?
[00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:01.020]  We'll tell black people not to go because you hate them.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.141]  Invoking that.
[00:09:03.197 --> 00:09:13.721]  Instead of talking about the real issues, now the Democrats have been caught sending people in Nazi outfits with Nazi signs, this is even in the AP, to events all over the country, and it blew up in their face.
[00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:20.464]  And now Clinton's on television saying there will be a terror attack if the Tea Parties don't shut up, they're gonna cause it.
[00:09:21.224 --> 00:09:22.665]  Now, I've seen this before.
[00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.226]  I'm telling you again, this is what's happening.
[00:09:25.246 --> 00:09:26.147]  This is what's going on.
[00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:27.547]  We're in grave danger.
[00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:28.508]  This is a PSYOP.
[00:09:29.108 --> 00:09:49.839]  Now, looking at the real enemy, the criminals, the top groups on Wall Street, not your local bank, not your local broker, but the people that run it, Max Keiser for years, top broker, stock market inventor, TV shows on BBC, Al Jazeera, Press TV, RT, you name it.
[00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:51.258]  Yes.
[00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:13.764]  That they got the documents on that they were betting against the housing market while telling people it was good and paying for insurance to have a triple A rated.
[00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:16.005]  Then the looting of AIG.
[00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:19.226]  That was the big payout kitty they used to pay the criminals.
[00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:21.007]  Now they want more.
[00:10:21.047 --> 00:10:28.510]  They're calling it banking reform, but it gives the same group power over other financial institutions that they want to wreck their competition.
[00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.970]  Max Keiser, you've got the floor.
[00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:34.512]  Tell us about financial terrorism and how it works and what we're facing.
[00:10:35.982 --> 00:10:41.270]  Well, I have been doing many reports about this and films for a number of years.
[00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:49.743]  I mean, you mentioned that these attacks are coming, but they're here now and they're happening now and they've been happening for the past two years.
[00:10:49.763 --> 00:10:51.085]  These are financial attacks.
[00:10:51.605 --> 00:10:59.028]  When the crisis hit in 2008, people were saying, wow, this is a 100-year phenomenon.
[00:10:59.068 --> 00:10:59.989]  Nobody saw it coming.
[00:11:00.249 --> 00:11:16.316]  Now we know that Lehman Brothers had a bank right down the street where they had this huge slush fund that they parked $50 billion worth of cash and debt so that at the end of the quarter, when they needed to report to the SEC what their cash holding was, they could play counting games with their little
[00:11:16.836 --> 00:11:18.256]  A fake bank down the street.
[00:11:18.517 --> 00:11:34.201]  We know that Goldman Sachs now, according to the SEC, allegedly involved in fraud in terms of selling tainted bonds to investors all over the world, including in Europe, where now you see problems with the Greek economy blowing up and other countries' economies are blowing up.
[00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:39.622]  And of course, Iceland went through this already two years ago, as I made that film about it, in 2007-2008.
[00:11:39.642 --> 00:11:46.324]  The Icelandic corona collapsed, the Icelandic economy collapsed.
[00:11:46.844 --> 00:12:10.803]  And now, in an ironic fitting fit of poetic justice, the volcanoes are erupting in Iceland, and they're sending out this toxic cloud of ash to the UK, who wanted to extract even another five billion from Iceland to appease the financial terrorists, but the gods, the volcanoes in Iceland, are taking on the fake
[00:12:11.623 --> 00:12:12.504]  We're good to go.
[00:12:26.992 --> 00:12:31.134]  You know, right before the French Revolution, there was a huge volcano in Iceland.
[00:12:31.534 --> 00:12:33.434]  It blanketed the globe in dust and ash.
[00:12:33.494 --> 00:12:42.438]  The agriculture failed, which led to the government of France failing on its financial obligations, which gave rise to the French Revolution.
[00:12:42.538 --> 00:12:44.258]  It started with a volcano in Iceland.
[00:12:44.278 --> 00:12:45.499]  There's a direct parallel.
[00:12:47.222 --> 00:12:50.465]  History only repeats itself in these cycles.
[00:12:50.485 --> 00:12:54.329]  There's a lot of things going on that aren't in our books.
[00:12:54.369 --> 00:12:55.470]  There's a lot of things going on.
[00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:02.036]  Look, obviously, Alex, look, obviously, the volcano is demanding that we sacrifice some bankers to the volcano.
[00:13:02.477 --> 00:13:07.501]  I say let's get Blankfein, let's get Jamie Dimon, let's get Dick Fuld and throw them into the volcano.
[00:13:07.702 --> 00:13:09.523]  That's the only way we can stop the nightmare.
[00:13:09.904 --> 00:13:11.946]  Sacrifice bankers to the volcano.
[00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:17.289]  Well, let's get serious here for a moment, but that is an intriguing idea there, Doctor.
[00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:30.957]  We're back to pre-Industrial Revolution days of feudalism, because what they want to do is they want to pursue an economy of lords and serfs.
[00:13:31.357 --> 00:13:33.318]  They want us to be free-range slaves.
[00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:40.525]  Uh, tied into our, uh, you know, our, uh, the reason we don't see bread lines in America is because they throw out all these swipe cards.
[00:13:40.545 --> 00:13:43.968]  They're getting food stamps, vis-a-vis, uh, and, and swipe cards.
[00:13:43.988 --> 00:13:44.849]  They're getting food stamps.
[00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:47.811]  Now what is it, 30-something million now on food stamps?
[00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:49.373]  Bread lines in America, just like in the Depression!
[00:13:50.822 --> 00:13:52.003]  Let's go back to volcanoes.
[00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:54.725]  Later in the next hour after you leave us, I will get into the AP.
[00:13:55.085 --> 00:14:02.890]  Top volcanologists are warning that the super caldera, that's four states in size, centered in and around Yellowstone, could blow.
[00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.372]  I mean, I mean, this is becoming biblical.
[00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:10.095]  All these earthquakes hitting major cities and volcanoes blowing up and tsunamis.
[00:14:10.555 --> 00:14:17.780]  And now they're saying, now they're saying that the super volcano, thousands of times bigger than what Iceland has, could blow up.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.502]  I mean, hell, it could be the end of the world, Kaiser.
[00:14:21.683 --> 00:14:24.644]  Well, I mean, everyone understands the crisis happening now.
[00:14:25.025 --> 00:14:36.992]  Finally, the SEC, they finally have charged Goldman with fraud, and now this is going to unleash a wave of lawsuits for all the activity that's been going on for the past five to ten years, ever since the
[00:14:37.933 --> 00:14:46.541]  The passage of the Futures Commodity Futures Modernization Act back in the year 2000, which swept in a wave of all this fraud.
[00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:49.744]  But I can tell you right now what the fraud is going to be.
[00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:56.291]  Two years from today, you're going to be doing a show talking about how Hollywood blew up because of derivatives.
[00:14:57.094 --> 00:14:58.596]  And this is just happening right now.
[00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:04.723]  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has just approved derivative trading for boxed office futures contracts.
[00:15:04.783 --> 00:15:05.824]  And that's the next bubble.
[00:15:05.844 --> 00:15:07.025]  I want to get into that later.
[00:15:07.045 --> 00:15:10.950]  And I want to get into testimony two weeks ago in Congress.
[00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:11.971]  100 to 1 leverage.
[00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:14.073]  World's largest fraud exposed.
[00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:17.137]  JPMorgan Chase caught manipulating gold and silver.
[00:15:17.557 --> 00:15:20.258]  And they've now got whistleblowers testifying before Congress.
[00:15:20.278 --> 00:15:31.665]  But the next big bubble, being Hollywood, but going back, you've been on your TV show, British radio, Russian radio, national French TV, you're everywhere.
[00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.026]  Global force out there, Max Keiser.
[00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:35.787]  Play the Moscow clip!
[00:15:35.927 --> 00:15:37.047]  Play the Moscow clip!
[00:15:37.087 --> 00:15:37.748]  Tell the people!
[00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:42.913]  Okay, guys, do you have that clip queued up of him on Moscow Radio and TV?
[00:15:43.153 --> 00:15:45.516]  Okay, let's go ahead and play this clip from Max Keiser.
[00:15:45.636 --> 00:15:45.977]  Here it is.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.604]  Before we leave this idea of financial terrorism, let me just elaborate on that a little bit.
[00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:52.325]  Because...
[00:15:57.031 --> 00:16:03.419]  Typically, people associate terrorists with fanatics who are associated with an ideology.
[00:16:03.439 --> 00:16:10.468]  That they're willing to kill themselves and others for that ideology.
[00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:11.970]  Including innocent victims.
[00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:17.097]  Now let's talk about Hank Paulson for a second.
[00:16:17.217 --> 00:16:29.090]  He believes in an ideology called market fundamentalism, which is as pernicious as any ideological, theocratic, fundamentalist fanaticism in the world today.
[00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.792]  So it's a kind of religion?
[00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:42.084]  Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, recently said he's doing God's work!
[00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:43.626]  He's a fanatic!
[00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:44.367]  He's a market fanatic!
[00:16:52.957 --> 00:17:01.746]  And in the case of Lehman Brothers, you had bankers, suicide bankers, blowing themselves up in the name of market fundamentalism, and people in Iceland die!
[00:17:01.966 --> 00:17:03.388]  People in Iceland were rioting!
[00:17:03.528 --> 00:17:08.333]  People around the world are starving because of these suicide bankers and financial terrorists!
[00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:13.258]  Okay, now, Max, separately,
[00:17:16.542 --> 00:17:17.503]  It's now... Yes?
[00:17:18.364 --> 00:17:21.506]  Now I have a video clip of Kramer on Frontline in 1996.
[00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:23.728]  Oh, Kramer!
[00:17:23.768 --> 00:17:24.509]  Not Kramer!
[00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.491]  Don't abuse your audience like that!
[00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:27.611]  No, no, Kramer.
[00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:28.532]  We're going to play it later.
[00:17:29.013 --> 00:17:35.198]  Kramer saying it's a religion, a social Darwinistic religion, and that it's natural and fair and reasonable.
[00:17:35.458 --> 00:17:40.983]  Then we have a later clip of him two years ago admitting that he would rig markets when he shorted them.
[00:17:41.687 --> 00:17:45.748]  Well, he's talked about the way he rigs markets all the time.
[00:17:46.048 --> 00:18:00.773]  Kramer's a market rigger, he's a market manipulator, and he works for the market fundamentalists who believe that when they make money, it's the work of God, and everyone else can lose money because they're not down with God like they are.
[00:18:02.223 --> 00:18:12.554]  As I said, it's as ridiculous and it's as obscene as what's happening, you know, with these priests.
[00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:15.834]  You know, these pedophile priests who are betraying the church.
[00:18:16.134 --> 00:18:18.315]  Here you've got Jim Cramer, who's supposed to be a capitalist.
[00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:27.600]  He's betraying capitalism by performing essentially the same thing on markets, by fiddling with markets in a most unholy manner.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.822]  And he will be damned, and he will go to hell as a result.
[00:18:31.982 --> 00:18:38.606]  And then always telling us that no matter how much money they steal in government bailouts, that it's the free market, when it's the opposite.
[00:18:38.646 --> 00:18:40.707]  As Ron Paul has said, it's corporatism.
[00:18:41.027 --> 00:18:41.848]  It's fascism.
[00:18:42.719 --> 00:18:48.762]  It's rigged market capitalism, and the next chapter in rigged market capitalism is going to be rigged Hollywood.
[00:18:49.123 --> 00:18:59.108]  And they're rigging Hollywood right now, and two years from today, I'll be on your show, and I'll say, wow, the Hollywood industry blew up because of all the derivatives trading, and nobody saw it coming.
[00:18:59.268 --> 00:19:01.270]  Who could have seen this happen?
[00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.471]  And I'm telling you right now exactly what's going to happen.
[00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:04.651]  We're good to go.
[00:19:19.957 --> 00:19:22.398]  Max Keiser's stay there, which is what the bankers like.
[00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:25.379]  Then they'll come in with taxpayer money and take it over.
[00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:56.338]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:19:56.438 --> 00:20:01.483]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:20:01.663 --> 00:20:04.326]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:10.292]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[00:20:10.492 --> 00:20:19.358]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[00:20:19.658 --> 00:20:27.164]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.

[00:20:47.498 --> 00:20:52.942]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:20:52.962 --> 00:20:55.163]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:20:55.283 --> 00:20:58.045]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:20:58.486 --> 00:21:03.249]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:03.609 --> 00:21:07.792]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:10.435]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:10.555 --> 00:21:12.959]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:12.979 --> 00:21:15.902]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:23.853]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:24.193 --> 00:21:29.456]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:29.556 --> 00:21:32.358]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:32.418 --> 00:21:35.860]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.021]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:38.502]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:38.542 --> 00:21:39.642]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:49.898 --> 00:21:53.159]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:58.581]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[00:21:58.801 --> 00:22:04.203]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[00:22:05.563 --> 00:22:06.404]  The value of the U.S.
[00:22:06.424 --> 00:22:08.346]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:12.971]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need to act today.

[00:22:22.361 --> 00:22:30.646]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[00:22:30.866 --> 00:22:41.932]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.
[00:22:41.952 --> 00:22:49.236]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a lifetime to establish.

[00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.640]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.

[00:23:53.758 --> 00:24:03.501]  Coming up in the next hour, Luke Rudowsky got to have a talk with Stephen Colbert about the Moldenberg Group threatening to kill independent journalists, and Colbert talked about it on his TV show.
[00:24:04.241 --> 00:24:07.762]  It's been about 20-30 minutes with Luke, then I'm going to get back into government-staged terror.
[00:24:08.222 --> 00:24:10.863]  This article up at InfoWars.com is so important.
[00:24:11.223 --> 00:24:14.184]  Government preparing to stage domestic terror attack.
[00:24:14.604 --> 00:24:16.785]  Now, if you think the Iceland-Earth
[00:24:18.151 --> 00:24:18.611]  Problems.
[00:24:18.671 --> 00:24:19.691]  Earth changes are bad.
[00:24:19.771 --> 00:24:20.932]  The volcano.
[00:24:21.352 --> 00:24:23.212]  Look at this French news agency report.
[00:24:23.332 --> 00:24:26.693]  Rare Yellowstone volcano eruption would be deadly.
[00:24:27.253 --> 00:24:29.633]  The biggest known volcano in the world.
[00:24:29.653 --> 00:24:34.074]  We're going to be talking about that towards the end of the next hour.
[00:24:34.894 --> 00:24:38.975]  And look, scientists have always said that asteroids didn't hit the Earth but every few million years.
[00:24:39.575 --> 00:24:43.296]  But Shoemaker-Levy comet that broke up in five pieces and hit Saturn
[00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:50.810]  Proved, because now they can look at the solar system, that planets are being hit every few decades by big asteroids.
[00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.331]  And Earth, about every hundred years, gets hit by one.
[00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:59.633]  And so we are looking right now, statistically, for that to happen.
[00:25:00.133 --> 00:25:02.234]  Volcanoes, they thought, didn't erupt that much.
[00:25:02.514 --> 00:25:05.014]  Look at all the eruptions, look at all the earthquakes we're now having.
[00:25:05.595 --> 00:25:06.995]  We live in a very volatile Earth.
[00:25:07.015 --> 00:25:09.736]  But don't worry, there's another religion, not just the fake Wall Street people.
[00:25:10.336 --> 00:25:16.361]  There's the derivatives with the greenhouse gas taxes, where you pay an indulgence to the church, i.e.
[00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:29.731]  Al Gore, he waves a wand, and Max Keiser, if we paid taxes to Al Gore and Barack Obama, and to George Soros and others, would they wave a wand and stop the earthquakes and volcanoes?
[00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:35.396]  Because they are in the news today, and the UN is saying, this is global warming that caused the volcano.
[00:25:37.153 --> 00:25:49.766]  Well, carbon trading, which is an offshoot of global warming, as I pointed out on your show before, is just another derivative nightmare being cooked up by the folks on Wall Street.
[00:25:49.786 --> 00:25:57.655]  And once they bust out the real estate market, and they bust out the dot-com market, or the savings alone, or the long-term capital management, you know, they need fresh
[00:25:58.255 --> 00:26:04.118]  Markets to blow up and carbon trading and box office futures clearly are going to be those markets.
[00:26:04.418 --> 00:26:06.979]  Canterford's Gerald, by the way, is big in both of those markets.
[00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:10.320]  You know, Canterford's Gerald is a firm that you don't hear a lot about.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.003]  It's not as big as the other firms, except they did lose the most bankers of any firm on 9-11.
[00:26:16.023 --> 00:26:18.244]  That's probably their most notoriety.
[00:26:18.684 --> 00:26:25.127]  But they are involved in both of these markets, and carbon trading is just another way to create derivatives
[00:26:25.808 --> 00:26:27.890]  So they make money on the way up?
[00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:51.416]  And then they make money on the way down with a bailout, and then it always is a selective bailout, destroying their competition.
[00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:55.019]  Shifting gears into another subject, your take on gold and silver?
[00:26:55.039 --> 00:27:05.888]  I mean, the numbers we see from mainline groups is that gold should be $2,500 or so, silver $50, balanced from the 1980s numbers with inflation, and now there's been congressional testimony
[00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:18.173]  With insiders and the head of GATA, the Gold Antitrust Group, documenting that JP Morgan and others are manipulating gold and the ways they're doing that.
[00:27:18.213 --> 00:27:19.133]  What's your take on that?
[00:27:19.614 --> 00:27:20.474]  Oh yeah, okay.
[00:27:20.554 --> 00:27:21.915]  Let's get into that in a second.
[00:27:22.235 --> 00:27:34.060]  But first, I wanted to mention, because I made a prediction on your show a couple of months ago, maybe three or four months ago, and I laid it out in no uncertain terms, and a lot of people really thought that I was
[00:27:34.847 --> 00:27:40.050]  Making a very kind of off-the-wall prediction, but listen to this out.
[00:27:41.751 --> 00:27:48.736]  I said on your show a few months ago that Facebook, with their virtual currency game Farmville,
[00:27:49.446 --> 00:27:57.653]  We're gonna end up as a way to just basically push debt onto unsuspecting users using their virtual currency.
[00:27:58.034 --> 00:28:05.380]  Now here's the, if you look this up as a headline on Guardian, FarmVille user runs up a 900 pound debt, roughly $1,200.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:16.470]  A 12 year old boy spent 625 pounds on his mother's credit card and another 288 pounds of his own savings on the Facebook game FarmVille.
[00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.031]  Now, this is the beginning.
[00:28:19.091 --> 00:28:23.314]  This is the start of virtual enslavement and virtual currencies.
[00:28:23.654 --> 00:28:32.800]  Get these kids hooked on what looks like innocent games on the internet and through Facebook, and before you know it, they owe real money to these people.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:41.546]  They've got real credit card debts, of course, of being charged extortionary rates, and now they're under the gun to pay back these debts using these so-called innocent games.
[00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:44.768]  And you're going to see this become an explosion over the next two or three years.
[00:28:44.788 --> 00:28:48.712]  The virtual currency business right now... Well, what about Second Life?
[00:28:48.732 --> 00:28:50.393]  What about Second Life?
[00:28:50.573 --> 00:28:57.359]  Where people are paying thousands of dollars for a fictitious Ferrari and they spend all their time on it like it's the real world.
[00:28:57.959 --> 00:29:00.842]  But they go into debt to pay for the fictitious Ferrari.
[00:29:01.183 --> 00:29:07.850]  So, it's similar, it's like 12-year-olds doing exactly what the people in Germany did when they bought fictitious bonds from Goldman Sachs.
[00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.553]  They wake up one day and they say, wait a minute, this was a fictitious bond.
[00:29:10.793 --> 00:29:12.755]  But Goldman says, wait, you still owe us $10 billion.
[00:29:13.716 --> 00:29:14.697]  Yeah, we've- we've- Max.
[00:29:14.717 --> 00:29:14.777]  Max.
[00:29:14.797 --> 00:29:15.258]  We got a break.
[00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:31.659]  Max, we got a break.
[00:29:31.699 --> 00:29:32.720]  When we come back, let's get into this.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.081]  We found the London Guardian article.
[00:29:34.381 --> 00:29:36.042]  We'll put it up on screen during the break.
[00:29:36.582 --> 00:29:40.204]  And with Half-Life and all these other, uh, uh, Second Life, it's incredible.
[00:29:40.724 --> 00:29:41.625]  We're on the march.
[00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:43.726]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:44.646 --> 00:29:47.348]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:50.433 --> 00:29:55.797]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:29:57.077 --> 00:30:01.841]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:02.221 --> 00:30:09.025]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:10.947 --> 00:30:13.468]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:17.291]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:30:19.444 --> 00:30:30.993]  We turned jeans inside out.
[00:30:31.253 --> 00:30:32.754]  Diamond Gusset jeans.
[00:30:33.035 --> 00:30:35.597]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:42.162]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:30:42.542 --> 00:30:44.744]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:30:45.244 --> 00:30:47.286]  Diamond Gusset jeans got it.
[00:30:47.606 --> 00:30:48.426]  Others don't.
[00:30:50.171 --> 00:30:51.152]  What's your home worth?
[00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:53.275]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:30:53.455 --> 00:30:56.199]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:30:56.499 --> 00:31:03.968]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:31:22.975 --> 00:31:23.355]  I think so.
[00:31:50.267 --> 00:31:52.888]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:53.288 --> 00:31:58.249]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:58.609 --> 00:32:00.349]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:05.470]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:06.610]  How much do you want?
[00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.591]  When do you want it?
[00:32:07.971 --> 00:32:09.571]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:09.851 --> 00:32:10.671]  When will you need it?
[00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:12.992]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:13.132 --> 00:32:14.172]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:14.452 --> 00:32:18.375]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:32:18.535 --> 00:32:21.057]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:21.257 --> 00:32:24.439]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:24.839 --> 00:32:28.341]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:28.662 --> 00:32:29.642]  How much will you need?
[00:32:29.882 --> 00:32:30.503]  We don't know.
[00:32:30.803 --> 00:32:31.704]  How much do you want?
[00:32:31.904 --> 00:32:32.624]  All you can get.
[00:32:32.824 --> 00:32:33.685]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:33.925 --> 00:32:36.687]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:36.967 --> 00:32:38.728]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[00:32:44.772 --> 00:32:58.076]  Alright, we're going back to Max Keiser.
[00:32:58.396 --> 00:33:00.457]  Your phone call is coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:02.057 --> 00:33:03.818]  A bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:33:05.469 --> 00:33:08.912]  But I want to talk about a host of issues and the gold situation with Max Keiser.
[00:33:09.052 --> 00:33:09.632]  We went to break.
[00:33:09.672 --> 00:33:10.933]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[00:33:11.414 --> 00:33:18.959]  I want to finish up with virtual currencies, scamming people that don't know they're getting involved in virtual currencies that actually cost real currency.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.963]  But before we do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[00:33:23.363 --> 00:33:24.444]  One of them is the Kola Blue.
[00:33:25.612 --> 00:33:27.093]  The Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:33:27.874 --> 00:33:30.376]  It looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[00:33:30.436 --> 00:33:35.700]  It grabs water out of the atmosphere and then puts it through 7 to 12 filters depending on which unit you buy.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.961]  It's the best, cleanest water you're going to find anywhere.
[00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:38.762]  I love Ecola Blue.
[00:33:38.782 --> 00:33:39.903]  I use it in my office and home.
[00:33:40.323 --> 00:33:42.545]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[00:33:42.845 --> 00:33:45.968]  Ecolablue.com or give them a call for an information packet.
[00:33:45.988 --> 00:33:46.028]  800-691-6043.
[00:33:46.048 --> 00:33:46.088]  800-691-6043.
[00:33:46.128 --> 00:33:48.690]  Or you can drink the government tap water because they care so much about you.
[00:33:54.834 --> 00:33:57.296]  Also, FrontSight.com, like the front of your rifle.
[00:33:57.356 --> 00:33:58.536]  FrontSight.com.
[00:33:59.757 --> 00:34:01.938]  They've got two-day, four-day, five-day training.
[00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:05.380]  It's the biggest private facility in the country for firearms training.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.220]  They're great folks.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:15.085]  And if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot at Dr. Ignatius Piazza will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:34:15.105 --> 00:34:20.227]  It's incredibly affordable and inexpensive to go take training there in handguns, rifles, or shotguns.
[00:34:21.288 --> 00:34:29.250]  You can get five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute, secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar, and get a free firearm.
[00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:32.531]  That's frontsight.com.
[00:34:32.551 --> 00:34:44.935]  And lastly, don't forget the online video bookstore at infowars.com, where you can get Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, our newest film just released last week to rave reviews, really is a powerful tool, and premiering
[00:34:45.555 --> 00:34:49.338]  In 48 hours at PrisonPlanet.tv, Police State, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:53.141]  It's been eight years since I've made, or right at eight years since I've made a Police State film.
[00:34:53.202 --> 00:34:56.905]  It covers the FEMA camps, the globalist takeover, false flag terror, everything.
[00:34:57.245 --> 00:34:59.006]  This film will wake people up.
[00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:01.809]  So you can order the DVD at InfoWars.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:02.049]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.850]  Or again, InfoWars.com.
[00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.031]  Okay, Max Keiser finishing up.
[00:35:13.198 --> 00:35:33.224]  We'll throw that London Guardian article back up on screen where it says that this game Farmville Farmville user runs up 900 pound or basically a $1,500 debt 12 year old boy didn't know basically what he was part of and you said this is something new that the manipulators are gonna do.
[00:35:33.304 --> 00:35:38.125]  I remember you probably four or five months ago talking about it here on the show.
[00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:39.446]  Listeners remember it as well.
[00:35:39.866 --> 00:35:40.946]  Why is this so important?
[00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:47.345]  Because Facebook has over 400 million users, and they're going to start to roll out a new virtual currency.
[00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:53.091]  And this virtual currency is a new currency that is going to have no collateral whatsoever.
[00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:57.516]  They can just issue all the currency they want, but it does have interest-bearing attached to it.
[00:35:57.916 --> 00:36:11.524]  So you'll be looking at your account and say, here's 10,000 more Facebook dollars, and you'll start spending it, and you'll start playing with it on FarmVille, or you'll start interacting on these various virtual platforms, and at the end of the month, you'll say, well, the interest on your virtual currency is due!
[00:36:11.584 --> 00:36:12.465]  You owe us 20 bucks!
[00:36:12.685 --> 00:36:13.105]  Real money!
[00:36:13.946 --> 00:36:22.616]  And I'm looking at a story that you post on your site on March 20 called, it says, a German central bank admits that credit is created out of thin air.
[00:36:22.856 --> 00:36:24.959]  This is on Infowars.com.
[00:36:25.019 --> 00:36:28.503]  It talks about most people think that banks lend solely on deposits.
[00:36:30.145 --> 00:36:35.151]  Uh, but in fact, the German Central Bank admits that they lend without any deposit at all.
[00:36:35.511 --> 00:36:37.354]  That's the definition of a virtual currency.
[00:36:37.574 --> 00:36:39.637]  They just lend, they have no deposit.
[00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:47.667]  Now, Facebook, which has 400 million users, turned out 500 million users, are going to just lend virtual currency to people with an interest attached to it.
[00:36:47.947 --> 00:37:02.103]  They're going to be interacting with it, and at the end of the month, they'll owe real dollars interest, which of course, if they can't pay it, then it kicks up to the federal government, then they start to garnish your pay, then they start to try to get the cash from you, and you're right back at that casino gulag that I've talked about so many times.
[00:37:02.864 --> 00:37:04.165]  Well, let's go one further.
[00:37:04.245 --> 00:37:06.706]  I remember when I was in college and had absolutely no money.
[00:37:07.506 --> 00:37:10.507]  Literally two, three, four credit cards a week were coming to me.
[00:37:10.527 --> 00:37:17.950]  And now that I have decent credit and I'm not in debt that much, I don't get but a few credit cards a year sent to me in the mail.
[00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:25.753]  So they send you credit cards backed up with nothing, 20, 30 percent interest, and literally make you a debt slave.
[00:37:25.853 --> 00:37:27.374]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[00:37:28.581 --> 00:37:29.141]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:29.161 --> 00:37:33.482]  You're dealing with the same thing, except it's more insidious than that.
[00:37:35.103 --> 00:37:38.564]  Because online, it's in a game environment.
[00:37:38.684 --> 00:37:40.405]  And here's another story you should look at.
[00:37:40.445 --> 00:37:41.525]  It's on the Financial Times.
[00:37:41.605 --> 00:37:45.206]  It's called Games Prey on Your Mind by Christopher Caldwell.
[00:37:45.746 --> 00:37:56.530]  It talks about how these environments, like on Facebook and other places, are designed by behavioral economists and casino operators to get you addicted, as you would in any casino.
[00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.690]  So it's not even economics at this point.
[00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:05.093]  It's just predatory lending by casino operators using these virtual currencies.
[00:38:05.153 --> 00:38:05.913]  It's a great story.
[00:38:06.273 --> 00:38:09.194]  It talks about in detail this new trend.
[00:38:09.674 --> 00:38:12.996]  And let's be clear, that's what the New World Order is, and they define themselves this way now.
[00:38:13.016 --> 00:38:19.381]  It's global private central banks who are Ponzi scheme operators, but instead of the Ponzi scheme going bust and they've got to hightail with the money,
[00:38:35.211 --> 00:38:52.686]  Now, they take over your society after each bust that they create, and everything is literally like a Matrix-like system where you take the game Second Life and others with tens of millions of users, they're spending 10, 20 hours a day in some cases.
[00:38:52.906 --> 00:38:59.972]  In fact, I've read articles of people dying after three, four days playing these games, not even getting up from their chair, and they're spending real money.
[00:39:01.854 --> 00:39:04.960]  A couple was raising a virtual child on an online game.
[00:39:05.361 --> 00:39:08.127]  They were in the video parlor for 12 hours.
[00:39:08.187 --> 00:39:12.356]  They neglected their real child, who died of starvation.
[00:39:15.124 --> 00:39:22.430]  And so when we talk about not being able to wake the public up, that they're under mind control, now they admit what we already knew over a decade ago, propaganda placement.
[00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:32.578]  The corporations call it behavior placement, where the government and corporations are paying for ads that brainwash us inside of the television program.
[00:39:32.598 --> 00:39:38.263]  So when you're talking to your neighbor and you can't get through to them about real issues, it's because they're literally under mind control.
[00:39:41.128 --> 00:39:47.832]  Economically speaking, what banks know and what politicians know is that everybody will
[00:39:49.224 --> 00:39:49.524]  Take.
[00:39:49.864 --> 00:39:50.264]  Free.
[00:39:50.525 --> 00:39:51.005]  Loans.
[00:39:51.325 --> 00:40:01.869]  And it goes back to the days when General Motors Acceptance Corporation, or GMAC, figured out that they could lend money to people to buy cars, and that's how they became number one over Ford Motor.
[00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:08.272]  And that's why GMAC became much bigger to Ford Motor, the lending to buy cars, than the actual car manufacturing.
[00:40:08.432 --> 00:40:10.973]  That's why they allowed cars manufactured to go to Japan.
[00:40:11.374 --> 00:40:14.415]  Because they made more money on lending and not on car manufacture.
[00:40:14.775 --> 00:40:16.696]  And that was a trend that's been in place for
[00:40:17.556 --> 00:40:32.181]  30 years where lending and financialization of the economy has taken precedence over all other aspects of the economy and has created a society that only looks at interest rates to determine their own self-worth and how much money they owe at the end of the month.
[00:40:32.461 --> 00:40:37.903]  And they're constantly willing to gamble at any given moment to try to get that debt level down.
[00:40:37.923 --> 00:40:45.986]  And of course they're always going to lose because the economy is operated by casino operators whose business it is to create losing gambles.
[00:40:46.346 --> 00:41:00.874]  And so we have this false economy waging war against the real economy, another reason for the fake environmental movement, that allows the casino operators to go in and selectively shut down any business or corporation that doesn't play ball with them.
[00:41:00.914 --> 00:41:13.221]  I mean, this is a psychological warfare system run by a bunch of criminals, and the public is almost defenseless because they've been conditioned by the mind control that it's cool to not care.
[00:41:14.383 --> 00:41:25.269]  Well, because these games and currencies are attached to basic technologies like the use of a phone or other basic utilities like electricity, it's unavoidable.
[00:41:25.689 --> 00:41:26.990]  Or like television.
[00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:35.054]  And so people come into contact with this, whether they like it or not, they are forced to come into contact with this and they're forced to become hooked on this.
[00:41:35.414 --> 00:41:37.195]  So it's just like a ghetto environment.
[00:41:37.215 --> 00:41:39.296]  People in the ghetto get hooked on drugs because
[00:41:39.896 --> 00:41:40.898]  It's all around them.
[00:41:41.218 --> 00:41:54.999]  And this new gulag casino ghetto of virtual currencies preys on the fact that people are unable to escape from this digital casino gulag envelopment of their lives by bankers and technologists and virtual currency lenders.
[00:41:55.692 --> 00:42:11.565]  And now, doctors are all over the place saying the 3D televisions literally put people into a dream state, even more than regular TV, and that it's causing seizures, it's causing people to pass out, it's causing mental illness, and all of television is about to convert to 3D.
[00:42:11.945 --> 00:42:14.347]  We are being inserted into this mental illness.
[00:42:15.928 --> 00:42:21.833]  Well, that's just part and parcel of a trend which is to
[00:42:22.682 --> 00:42:31.268]  To negate the reality of the real world, the natural forces of reality, and to accept the digital reality as being real.
[00:42:31.328 --> 00:42:33.989]  And that's what's so fantastic about this volcano in Iceland.
[00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.612]  That it's forcing people to understand that there is a real world.
[00:42:38.192 --> 00:42:42.837]  That there is an Earth that can do things that will change people's lives.
[00:42:42.897 --> 00:42:48.742]  And for this reason, this volcano in Iceland is quite important for people to understand that it's not a digital event.
[00:42:49.043 --> 00:42:50.124]  It's not a Hollywood event.
[00:42:50.404 --> 00:42:55.128]  This is an actual volcano affecting the actual planet Earth that we live in.
[00:42:55.649 --> 00:43:02.035]  And maybe this, you know, if it can shut down the grid and get people to understand that they are human,
[00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:06.818]  For at least a brief moment, then maybe there's a moment of sanity.
[00:43:07.298 --> 00:43:13.081]  And we see the UN coming in and saying, pay us taxes and we'll stop the volcano.
[00:43:13.121 --> 00:43:14.802]  That's actually in the news.
[00:43:15.162 --> 00:43:25.909]  So you have the establishment waging war, literally, against reality and trying to force everyone into this matrix.
[00:43:25.929 --> 00:43:27.630]  I mean, almost every adult male I know
[00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:36.498]  Doesn't research, isn't involved, doesn't care about their future, but they play fantasy football and really care, believing they own sports teams.
[00:43:37.537 --> 00:43:39.357]  Well, this is what I said is happening now.
[00:43:39.898 --> 00:43:46.779]  The fraudsters of the virtual currency and the prediction market operators are moving into this box office space of box office futures contracts.
[00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:48.600]  It's going to be a huge wave.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.720]  It's going to wash over.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:57.101]  You're going to have Jim Cramer talking about Scarlett Johansson moving up and down on the Canter Exchange and Iron Man Part 2 and Iron Man Part 3.
[00:43:57.362 --> 00:43:58.262]  It's going to go global.
[00:43:58.522 --> 00:44:03.643]  People won't be able to resist it because you're mixing the fraud of Wall Street with the fantasy of Hollywood.
[00:44:13.249 --> 00:44:16.210]  Literally, we are being inserted into a matrix right now.
[00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:17.431]  This is how it's happening.
[00:44:17.471 --> 00:44:24.075]  We're being sucked into the computers, sucked into the television, sucked into the false reality so fast.
[00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:28.998]  Now let's get into gold, because I want to get into gold and then back into the civil indictment
[00:44:29.798 --> 00:44:33.200]  Of Goldman Sachs and where you think that's going and what's being charged there.
[00:44:33.521 --> 00:44:37.903]  Your specific view, is this a red herring, a slap on the wrist, or is this the beginning of something new?
[00:44:37.923 --> 00:44:45.568]  Because we know Goldman Sachs literally runs the government, along with JPMorgan and others, so what does Max Keiser think is going on here?
[00:44:45.628 --> 00:44:46.469]  What's your intel?
[00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:54.354]  But back to the manipulation of the gold market, you have them pumping up fake things that aren't real into bubbles while suppressing
[00:44:55.134 --> 00:45:00.075]  A true commodity like silver or gold, with more and more evidence coming out of how they're manipulating it.
[00:45:00.875 --> 00:45:01.795]  Yes, excellent point.
[00:45:02.335 --> 00:45:04.016]  Gold and silver are real.
[00:45:04.476 --> 00:45:13.318]  And for that reason, it's a threat to the Ponzi schemes, the pyramid operators, and the Goldman Sachs derivative terrorist-wielding psychopaths on Wall Street.
[00:45:13.338 --> 00:45:15.158]  It's real, so it's a threat.
[00:45:15.438 --> 00:45:21.639]  And for this reason, they've kept the price down for years, and this is covered extensively by groups like Gold's Antitrust Action Committee.
[00:45:21.899 --> 00:45:24.160]  Now, a couple of weeks ago, there was testimony in London
[00:45:24.898 --> 00:45:25.198]  I think so.
[00:45:42.697 --> 00:45:51.807]  Just completely and utterly manipulated, and the CFTC now has this irrefutable evidence before them that they haven't acted on it yet.
[00:45:51.887 --> 00:45:59.936]  I wouldn't expect them to act on it, but essentially the goal here is to keep the price of gold and silver low because if it were to rise, it would be
[00:46:00.729 --> 00:46:11.937]  Reality rearing its ugly head and then money would start to flow into something real and out of the complete fake digital synthesized airsoft world of derivative trading and casino gulagism.
[00:46:12.398 --> 00:46:14.419]  And that's why the price has been kept as low.
[00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:24.387]  But there are people out there who have a lot of money who are forcing the exchanges like the London Bullying Market Association and Comex who are short
[00:46:25.067 --> 00:46:26.048]  A hundred times.
[00:46:27.009 --> 00:46:31.192]  They have a hundred times more orders than they have actual gold in the vault.
[00:46:31.593 --> 00:46:35.056]  So if these guys demand physical delivery of their silver,
[00:46:35.743 --> 00:46:40.285]  And it's proven and it's shown that they don't have the silver to deliver.
[00:46:40.325 --> 00:46:50.811]  You have what's called a short squeeze, so the market has to go out there and actually buy physical silver to deliver, and then you have this ramp up in the price of gold and silver.
[00:46:51.111 --> 00:46:55.073]  And that's kind of what people are waiting for right now, is they're waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[00:46:55.093 --> 00:46:57.054]  They're waiting for some major hedge fund to say,
[00:46:57.834 --> 00:47:00.536]  We want physical delivery of our gold and silver.
[00:47:00.576 --> 00:47:01.437]  We want it this month.
[00:47:01.737 --> 00:47:03.319]  I talked about this on your show last year.
[00:47:03.659 --> 00:47:07.963]  I thought that this was going to happen on the COMEX last December, that they were going to bust the COMEX.
[00:47:08.403 --> 00:47:09.924]  And it looked like they were going to do that.
[00:47:09.964 --> 00:47:16.490]  There was a guy up in Canada who was suggesting that he was going to bust the COMEX by demanding physical delivery of his gold.
[00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.571]  And it never materialized at that time.
[00:47:18.791 --> 00:47:20.973]  But the pressure has just been building ever since.
[00:47:22.719 --> 00:47:28.464]  Profit opportunities are dwindling because now the FTC and other regulators are shutting down the Ponzi scheme.
[00:47:28.844 --> 00:47:37.111]  The guys with the big money, they realize that the last game in town, even George Soros said that gold bullion will be the last bubble.
[00:47:37.351 --> 00:47:39.492]  It'll be the last hurrah.
[00:47:39.533 --> 00:47:40.373]  Prices won't go to $2,500.
[00:47:41.574 --> 00:47:43.436]  Prices will go to $10,000 to $15,000.
[00:47:43.576 --> 00:47:46.038]  It'll be a huge bubble.
[00:47:46.078 --> 00:47:47.299]  It'll be the last bubble.
[00:47:48.087 --> 00:47:49.308]  And, uh, it's not too late.
[00:47:49.348 --> 00:47:59.796]  People gotta own this thing now, because ultimately, when it's all exposed, and it all comes crashing down, only those with the gold are gonna be able to survive another day.
[00:47:59.976 --> 00:48:03.538]  And it won't matter if you bought gold at $1,000 and it goes up to $15,000.
[00:48:03.799 --> 00:48:06.060]  When it busts, it goes back down to $6,000.
[00:48:06.421 --> 00:48:07.141]  It won't matter.
[00:48:07.501 --> 00:48:09.943]  The suckers are gonna be the ones that are buying it when it's $10,000 an ounce.
[00:48:12.873 --> 00:48:22.178]  The general rule of thumb is just every single month put some savings into gold bullion and just do it religiously every month.
[00:48:22.798 --> 00:48:28.921]  And this way you're always going to get an average price that's good and you're going to be protected now.
[00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:36.258]  That's just, it's not going to shoot up 300% in a week like some dot-com stock.
[00:48:36.618 --> 00:48:43.362]  It's not going to be like Goldman Sachs crashing in a day that if you're short, you know, it's not a day trade.
[00:48:43.522 --> 00:48:47.945]  It's something you've got to do and think about intelligently and take an approach that works over time.
[00:48:47.965 --> 00:48:51.327]  I have been buying gold every month for eight years.
[00:48:53.444 --> 00:48:53.844]  Me too.
[00:48:54.505 --> 00:48:55.406]  A little bit every month.
[00:48:55.486 --> 00:48:57.307]  Now, let's get into Goldman Sachs.
[00:48:57.407 --> 00:49:00.870]  What does this SEC civil indictment mean?
[00:49:03.352 --> 00:49:22.988]  Well, it's really fascinating because they came out swinging last Friday with a very strong civil indictment and they laid out the case for alleged fraud and they've opened the door now to others
[00:49:23.308 --> 00:49:26.751]  For a criminal indictment, and there's going to be a lot of lawsuits.
[00:49:26.991 --> 00:49:29.173]  I'm looking for Andrew Cuomo in New York City.
[00:49:29.853 --> 00:49:39.441]  I think he could make a huge political gain if he did to Goldman what Rudy Giuliani did to Drexel Burnham back in the 1980s.
[00:49:39.461 --> 00:49:45.846]  If you remember, Drexel Burnham was the Goldman Sachs of his day before the stock market crash of 1987 with Mike Milken.
[00:49:46.406 --> 00:49:47.087]  And that crowd.
[00:49:47.367 --> 00:49:55.854]  Rudy Giuliani rode into town and busted up Drexel and it launched a huge political career for Rudy Giuliani.
[00:49:55.934 --> 00:50:00.178]  But this is much bigger and Goldman Sachs is running the looting globally.
[00:50:00.478 --> 00:50:02.620]  They're at the top, as you know, of almost every government.
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.242]  I mean, I don't see them allowing this to be brought down.
[00:50:05.262 --> 00:50:06.663]  Or are they getting ready to implode it?
[00:50:07.224 --> 00:50:09.626]  And are they already moving their assets out into a new shell?
[00:50:10.196 --> 00:50:22.360]  Well, remember, the busting of Drexel and Ivan Boski and Dennis Levine and that whole period resulted in a 22% drop in the Dow Jones in one day on October 19, 1987.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.181]  To put that into context, you'd have to have roughly a 2,500 point drop on the Dow in one day.
[00:50:25.221 --> 00:50:26.341]  So it was big news at the time.
[00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:34.786]  And it was really a seismic.
[00:50:34.966 --> 00:50:36.708]  It was the biggest crash in history at the time.
[00:50:36.948 --> 00:50:43.476]  So, although we've seen really some pain in the last couple of years... Well, stay there, stay there.
[00:50:43.516 --> 00:50:44.637]  Gotta break Max Keiser.
[00:50:44.677 --> 00:50:45.779]  MaxKeiser.com.
[00:50:46.219 --> 00:50:48.162]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:50:48.182 --> 00:50:48.822]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:50.555 --> 00:50:53.457]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've got to try MyPillow.

[00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:42.392]  MyPillow.

[00:51:55.144 --> 00:51:57.928]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:51:58.348 --> 00:52:03.115]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:03.475 --> 00:52:07.661]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:07.961 --> 00:52:10.303]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:10.423 --> 00:52:12.824]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:12.844 --> 00:52:15.766]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:16.106 --> 00:52:23.711]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:24.031 --> 00:52:29.314]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:29.414 --> 00:52:31.695]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:31.755 --> 00:52:35.717]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:35.977 --> 00:52:36.877]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:37.057 --> 00:52:38.358]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:38.378 --> 00:52:39.419]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:52.904 --> 00:53:58.928]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:53:59.529 --> 00:54:02.591]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:04.192 --> 00:54:12.738]  Max is with us five minutes into the next hour, and we got Luke Rodowski popping in with a big coup with Stephen Colbert.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.940]  But this is a big deal.
[00:54:17.242 --> 00:54:22.389]  Is the SEC basically run by Goldman Sachs being forced to do this because of the political pressure?
[00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:24.231]  Is it just a slap on the wrist?
[00:54:24.251 --> 00:54:26.474]  Will the investigation be used to cover all this up?
[00:54:27.355 --> 00:54:29.158]  But absolutely what Max said is true.
[00:54:29.919 --> 00:54:31.561]  This will open up more investigations.
[00:54:31.881 --> 00:54:32.602]  Are they trying to beat
[00:54:33.667 --> 00:54:39.649]  States that have been filing civil charges against Goldman Sachs.
[00:54:39.749 --> 00:54:40.670]  That happened two weeks ago.
[00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.050]  Two different states in the last two weeks.
[00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:44.171]  We're going to find out here.
[00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:52.675]  But if they get away with committing these crimes out in the open with their own documents proving this was premeditated with the housing market, the sky is the limit.
[00:54:52.695 --> 00:54:53.235]  Max Keiser.
[00:54:54.161 --> 00:54:57.704]  Well, the costs are facing students in Greece, Germany, and the UK.
[00:54:58.124 --> 00:55:05.389]  Remember in Greece in the year 2000, Goldman engineered a swap that allowed Greece to hide debt that made them eligible for the Euro.
[00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:07.631]  Now Greece is in deep financial trouble.
[00:55:07.651 --> 00:55:09.392]  The IMF is imposing austerity measures.
[00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:16.998]  I've been on Greek radio many times and telling them that they should not even consider paying back the debt because it was fraudulently induced by Goldman back in 2000.
[00:55:17.218 --> 00:55:19.420]  So they have no obligation to pay the debt.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.200]  Don't pay the debt.
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.682]  Germany is saying, wait a minute, wait a minute, what about our banks?
[00:55:22.882 --> 00:55:25.931]  How devastating was it that Iceland said no last month?
[00:55:30.111 --> 00:55:42.576]  Iceland said no to the $5 billion Ice Age bill that the UK and the Netherlands wanted to try to extract from them based on the behavior of some, you know, banking crooks, and they voted 93% said no.
[00:55:42.956 --> 00:55:50.559]  So the Icelandic people have taken a stand, and the Icelandic people, and now I talked to journalists in Greece, and the people in Greece are going to join with the people of Iceland.
[00:55:50.839 --> 00:55:54.421]  This is becoming a global insurrection against banker occupation.
[00:55:55.091 --> 00:55:56.172]  Okay, you just said it.
[00:55:56.572 --> 00:55:57.153]  Let me stop you.
[00:55:57.213 --> 00:56:00.415]  A global insurrection against banker occupation.
[00:56:00.835 --> 00:56:04.558]  So they're trying to sew it up now with a global government run by them to shut us down.
[00:56:05.058 --> 00:56:11.903]  And I've seen a year-long buildup to staged terror attacks and the Feds now hyping nuke attacks in the U.S.
[00:56:12.404 --> 00:56:14.986]  and trying to tie it into Iran and domestic groups.
[00:56:15.026 --> 00:56:22.591]  The only card I see them being able to play to launch new wars, Max, and to have a domestic clampdown is staged terror.
[00:56:22.611 --> 00:56:23.452]  What's your take on that?
[00:56:24.378 --> 00:56:30.000]  Well, my stage is that this problem is happening all over the world in these other countries.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.581]  And what we're seeing is this global insurrection against banking occupation.
[00:56:33.881 --> 00:56:45.344]  And through the Internet and other means, people are getting together to figure out how to push back against the occupying force, the neo-colonial, neo-imperial force of these banking oligarchs on Wall Street and around the world.
[00:56:45.624 --> 00:56:47.365]  They're coming up with strategies to do that.
[00:56:47.945 --> 00:56:52.909]  And it's gonna happen in pockets of resistance in countries and communities all over the world.
[00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:54.690]  This is not just an American problem.
[00:56:54.951 --> 00:56:57.152]  It's not just a UK problem or a Greek problem.
[00:56:57.472 --> 00:57:00.315]  This is happening for everyone in countries all over the world.
[00:57:00.335 --> 00:57:01.415]  Have they overreached?
[00:57:01.475 --> 00:57:02.436]  Have they overreached?
[00:57:02.476 --> 00:57:03.657]  Because they look scared now.
[00:57:03.697 --> 00:57:04.558]  They're acting scared.
[00:57:05.535 --> 00:57:14.298]  I think the problem they have is that for 25 years, every time they made a mistake, they would get bailed out by a rise in bond prices.
[00:57:14.598 --> 00:57:25.662]  As long as interest rates were cheap, they could always repackage, resell, and extend the maturity of the bonds that they were using to perpetrate all of their insidious little insider games.
[00:57:25.962 --> 00:57:35.365]  But now that that market has reached the end of a 25-year bull market, there's no more opportunity to repackage these bonds anymore, and they're collapsing.
[00:57:35.705 --> 00:57:41.687]  And it's causing what The Economist calls a disruption in the Cohesion Index.
[00:57:42.147 --> 00:57:44.928]  They have identified what they call the Cohesion Index.
[00:57:45.008 --> 00:57:50.630]  That is the index to determine at what stage are different countries about to insurrect.
[00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.271]  The United States is relatively high.
[00:57:53.551 --> 00:57:55.072]  The UK is relatively high.
[00:57:55.733 --> 00:58:02.076]  But we have on a cohesion index, you've got countries like Iceland is already revolting and other countries are already revolting.
[00:58:02.156 --> 00:58:09.620]  So The Economist magazine is already setting up an index around this revolt, this global insurrection, and they're already putting numbers attached to it.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.341]  They're already, you know, quantifying it.
[00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:16.063]  Well, that's what the Ministry of British Defense, the British Defense Ministry said three years ago.
[00:58:16.403 --> 00:58:17.763]  They predicted this in and around 2010, 11, 12.
[00:58:19.144 --> 00:58:24.345]  We're going to be back for five minutes as we start the fourth hour with Max Keiser.
[00:58:24.865 --> 00:58:28.527]  My question to him is, how does he see all this unwinding?
[00:58:31.888 --> 00:58:33.728]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:35.169 --> 00:58:36.709]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.341]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:41.381 --> 00:58:46.727]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:46.967 --> 00:58:51.612]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:58:51.992 --> 00:58:57.038]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:58:57.558 --> 00:59:02.261]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:02.782 --> 00:59:04.703]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:05.103 --> 00:59:09.706]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:09.906 --> 00:59:10.807]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:11.027 --> 00:59:13.789]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:17.391]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:17.712 --> 00:59:20.553]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:20.894 --> 00:59:22.795]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:23.115 --> 00:59:24.056]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:27.758 --> 00:59:31.402]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:31.923 --> 00:59:36.427]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:36.748 --> 00:59:39.210]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:43.114 --> 00:59:45.016]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:45.497 --> 00:59:48.259]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:02.708]  I was talking to Max during the break about stage terrors.
[01:00:02.788 --> 01:00:04.129]  I see them prepping everybody for it.
[01:00:04.729 --> 01:00:05.990]  And he said, look, it's global.
[01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:07.491]  You've got to see the strategic system.
[01:00:07.531 --> 01:00:08.911]  They want financial takeover.
[01:00:09.352 --> 01:00:11.092]  Well, I see that going on simultaneously.
[01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:12.793]  Max, we've got four and a half minutes left.
[01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:14.094]  You've got the floor.
[01:00:14.834 --> 01:00:15.375]  Enlighten us.
[01:00:15.415 --> 01:00:17.936]  Give us your breakdown on what's happening.
[01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:25.721]  Okay, Alex, as we were just saying, we know what the game is.
[01:00:25.781 --> 01:00:27.722]  It's no big secret anymore.
[01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:33.284]  There's a group of bankers who are seeking to reinstate feudalism.
[01:00:33.324 --> 01:00:42.508]  They were upset that they had to give any of their power away during the rise of what's called the Enlightenment and the last 200 years.
[01:00:42.908 --> 01:00:45.429]  Now, your show reaches out to millions.
[01:00:46.152 --> 01:00:46.252]  Yes.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.180]  A win in your column.
[01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:06.961]  You need to take a scalp here.
[01:01:07.181 --> 01:01:08.361]  You need to have a win.
[01:01:08.801 --> 01:01:15.723]  And the easiest thing that your listeners can do, that you and your listeners can do, is to take down a Fortune 100 company.
[01:01:16.024 --> 01:01:17.764]  Take down a Dow Jones company.
[01:01:18.164 --> 01:01:25.106]  And the easiest company to take down, one who's got a huge investor in Warren Buffett, one who's known... Is Coca-Cola.
[01:01:25.146 --> 01:01:28.067]  We go back to your obsession with Coca-Cola.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.740]  It's not an obsession.
[01:01:30.581 --> 01:01:37.002]  It's just a practical application of the only thing you have, which is a no-cost resistance.
[01:01:37.022 --> 01:01:37.782]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:01:37.802 --> 01:01:40.423]  We've taken plenty of scalps, Max.
[01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.684]  I mean, look at the Copenhagen thing.
[01:01:42.724 --> 01:01:43.824]  We all did that together.
[01:01:43.844 --> 01:01:45.404]  Look at all the other victories we're having.
[01:01:45.625 --> 01:01:49.686]  Look at how we exposed Democratic operatives dressed up like Nazis at tea parties.
[01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:50.946]  I mean, what are you saying, take a scalp?
[01:01:51.428 --> 01:01:57.991]  Well, I'm saying that the measure of wealth and income in America is getting wider and wider.
[01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:01.373]  The poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer.
[01:02:01.413 --> 01:02:04.934]  That's how I determine if the scalps are being taken and who's winning.
[01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:08.176]  And my suggestion is to marshal your forces.
[01:02:08.756 --> 01:02:12.439]  And boycott Coca-Cola until that stock price goes to zero.
[01:02:12.759 --> 01:02:25.468]  You wipe out Coke, you punch Warren Buffett in the nose, because he's one of the biggest shareholders of Coke, you demonstrate that you've got the power to take on a Fortune 100 company, and now suddenly you're in the driver's seat.
[01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:28.810]  You have to look at what's dear to these people.
[01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:29.811]  It's their stock price.
[01:02:30.131 --> 01:02:31.793]  They have no morals, no ethics.
[01:02:32.033 --> 01:02:38.278]  They've got no compunction about destroying themselves and their society and their country.
[01:02:38.318 --> 01:02:40.000]  They only care about their stock price.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.763]  Therefore, the only way you can fight back is to take their stock price down.
[01:02:44.024 --> 01:02:47.106]  And the boycott is the cheapest, easiest, no-cost solution.
[01:02:47.427 --> 01:02:48.568]  And just look at the stock price.
[01:02:48.648 --> 01:02:49.969]  If it's going down, you're winning.
[01:02:50.289 --> 01:02:52.211]  And take it down to zero.
[01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:54.313]  Okay, let me throw something in here.
[01:02:55.350 --> 01:03:03.753]  There's more than one way to skin a cat, and we're going on all fronts because that's most effective, in my opinion, is just to expose the fraud, and then the people will do the rest.
[01:03:03.833 --> 01:03:06.454]  But look at Washington.
[01:03:06.935 --> 01:03:18.159]  It's illegitimate, it's owned by foreign banks, we take the states back, then the offshore banks and brokerage firms won't have the federal government funding them with all our tax money.
[01:03:20.515 --> 01:03:30.586]  Yeah, but that's great if you run a multi-billion dollar hedge fund and you have a seat at the table and you can have a big swinging, you know, I don't want to say the word, but you don't.
[01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:39.536]  All you have are a lot of people who are angry who have not of the same amount of money and who are being victimized by these consumer product
[01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:42.153]  Predatory lending psychopath.
[01:03:42.714 --> 01:03:48.860]  And you have to also be aware that a single metric, which is a stock price, can work both ways.
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:56.088]  Not only does it show how much money the bad guys are making, but it can also show how effective your campaign is against
[01:03:56.588 --> 01:04:02.870]  So you know when you go on the air every week and you say, Coca-Cola stock price is down another 10% this week.
[01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:04.330]  We have won.
[01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.411]  It's right there in black and white in the pages of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:04:07.751 --> 01:04:13.032]  And before you know it, they're going to be coming to you begging you to call off your forces.
[01:04:13.192 --> 01:04:14.813]  They're going to be coming to you begging you.
[01:04:14.833 --> 01:04:19.694]  But won't the bankers then just, won't the Plunge Protection Team just quietly buy Coca-Cola stock?
[01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:22.992]  Anything that'll cost them money.
[01:04:23.213 --> 01:04:24.453]  And they hate to spend money.
[01:04:25.114 --> 01:04:27.055]  Because you're killing them where it hurts.
[01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:28.296]  They can buy the stock.
[01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:29.617]  They can increase the dividend.
[01:04:29.977 --> 01:04:31.518]  They can spend money on marketing.
[01:04:31.758 --> 01:04:32.839]  But they don't want to spend money.
[01:04:32.859 --> 01:04:34.080]  They want to take the money.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.141]  They hate spending money.
[01:04:35.521 --> 01:04:38.223]  If they start spending money to buy back their own stock, you're winning.
[01:04:38.243 --> 01:04:40.544]  All right, look, we're going to have you back up soon.
[01:04:40.564 --> 01:04:43.146]  And we'll spend 30 minutes of an hour on that.
[01:04:43.206 --> 01:04:44.567]  Max Keiser, MaxKeiser.com.
[01:04:44.587 --> 01:04:46.068]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:04:46.088 --> 01:04:46.989]  All right, buddy.
[01:04:50.006 --> 01:04:52.287]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:04:52.387 --> 01:04:54.608]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:04:54.708 --> 01:04:57.509]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:04:57.909 --> 01:05:02.671]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:07.233]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:05:07.533 --> 01:05:09.794]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:05:09.994 --> 01:05:12.395]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:05:12.415 --> 01:05:15.317]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:05:15.677 --> 01:05:23.302]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:05:23.622 --> 01:05:28.905]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:05:29.005 --> 01:05:31.307]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:35.269]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:05:35.529 --> 01:05:36.469]  And I got news for you.
[01:05:36.629 --> 01:05:37.910]  You're everyone else.
[01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:38.970]  Invisible Empire.

[01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.530]  Okay.

[01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:08.478]  Wow!

[01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:57.981]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:58.581 --> 01:08:01.543]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:17.723]  Okay, for stations that just joined us, coming up, we've discovered a secret FEMA document, confirmed to be real.
[01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:25.927]  They've been telling major newspapers to remove it, like the Christian Science Monitor and others, and publicintelligence.com.
[01:08:26.647 --> 01:08:35.011]  And you've got Obama saying we're going to be nuked, the FBI director saying domestic groups are the number one threat now, or as bad as Al Qaeda.
[01:08:35.552 --> 01:08:40.114]  You've got this crescendo of the media saying the Tea Parties aren't just racist,
[01:08:40.754 --> 01:08:43.896]  Which they've been caught with Democratic operatives dressed up like Nazis.
[01:08:44.677 --> 01:08:48.800]  Red-handed now, something we broke three weeks ago that's now become mainstream news.
[01:08:50.401 --> 01:08:56.005]  But Bill Clinton's saying, gee, he hopes there doesn't have to be a terror attack to make the Tea Party shut up.
[01:08:56.205 --> 01:08:58.127]  Well, who stands to gain from that terror attack?
[01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.828]  See, he's saying, this will discredit you.
[01:09:00.489 --> 01:09:01.930]  And he's saying this on Wolf Blitzer.
[01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:06.713]  Oklahoma City, 15 years ago today, was a staged event.
[01:09:07.134 --> 01:09:08.895]  We go over the evidence in Road to Tyranny.
[01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:15.751]  Ladies and gentlemen, the American people are standing up against the criminality in Washington.
[01:09:16.172 --> 01:09:18.173]  And the oldest trick in the book is to stage events.
[01:09:18.213 --> 01:09:23.896]  We see all this media hype, all this prep for this in the near future.
[01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:27.538]  I'll be breaking that down coming up after Luke Rodowski leaves us.
[01:09:27.918 --> 01:09:33.181]  But I wanted to get Luke on because last week he got into the Stephen Colbert report.
[01:09:34.688 --> 01:09:45.671]  And he stood up in the crowd and talked to him about the New World Order, and Colbert thought he was talking about Bohemian Grove, which is one of the secret societies, but more of their party arm.
[01:09:47.031 --> 01:09:48.291]  He said, no Bilderberg group.
[01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.332]  And then when Colbert went live, he talked about it.
[01:09:51.352 --> 01:09:54.073]  But that's just one of the reasons we have Luke on today.
[01:09:54.453 --> 01:09:55.513]  So much is happening.
[01:09:56.994 --> 01:10:00.316]  The momentum is intensifying for liberty and freedom.
[01:10:00.757 --> 01:10:02.458]  The awakening is accelerating.
[01:10:02.858 --> 01:10:06.200]  Greece, Iceland and others are saying no to the banker takeovers.
[01:10:06.781 --> 01:10:16.127]  And that's why we know they're going to stage terror attacks, possibly even nuclear, as a pretext to bring in total police state control.
[01:10:16.167 --> 01:10:22.011]  And that's why this NLE 010, 2010 FEMA document is so important.
[01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:26.774]  Luke, your take on false flag terrorism on the 15th anniversary of Oklahoma City.
[01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:30.298]  I mean, it's been something that governments have been doing throughout history.
[01:10:30.318 --> 01:10:37.386]  It wouldn't surprise us if they would use it against people who are demanding righteousness and truth from our government and accountability.
[01:10:37.646 --> 01:10:39.668]  So we have to keep an eye on provocateurs.
[01:10:39.688 --> 01:10:42.431]  We have to keep an eye on all these false flags that are going on.
[01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:46.356]  At the same time, we have to resend our message saying we are against
[01:10:46.956 --> 01:11:00.103]  Uh, you know, violence against provocateurs and expose false flag attacks because as soon as we expose 9-11, Oklahoma City and the 93 World Trade Center bombings, the less likely chances there is of another false flag.
[01:11:00.143 --> 01:11:06.367]  The more we expose 9-11, the more chances we have of saving this republic and stopping another false flag from tapping.
[01:11:07.421 --> 01:11:14.222]  Well, I mean, let's talk about just We Are Change that you founded two and a half years ago, hundreds of chapters around the world, because it is decentralized.
[01:11:14.242 --> 01:11:15.082]  It's just an idea.
[01:11:15.362 --> 01:11:16.783]  Be the change you want to see in the world.
[01:11:16.823 --> 01:11:17.663]  Be nonviolent.
[01:11:21.244 --> 01:11:21.744]  Absolutely.
[01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:25.764]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:11:26.424 --> 01:11:29.265]  But Luke, look at the false flags you've been through.
[01:11:29.305 --> 01:11:33.546]  In Truth Rising, we have the video of New York City police when you're protesting.
[01:11:36.363 --> 01:11:41.566]  We're losing your, uh, we lost audio with Luke, because everybody has to do these interviews on cell phones.
[01:11:42.107 --> 01:11:43.688]  He just came out of his college class.
[01:11:45.569 --> 01:11:54.694]  Luke is there, and the police come over, and they're protesting peacefully and legally, and they say, you've got a bomb in your bag.
[01:11:55.155 --> 01:11:57.396]  They say, your camera is a gun.
[01:11:57.456 --> 01:11:59.657]  We know you don't have a bomb, but we're going to frame you.
[01:12:00.198 --> 01:12:01.759]  And they do this on video!
[01:12:02.219 --> 01:12:02.939]  And then we had the...
[01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:09.272]  German Tallis is in the New York Post and all over Fox News.
[01:12:09.332 --> 01:12:18.455]  A man comes out of a dark corner, an alley, with his daughter in a wheelchair, ramming it into Mr. Tallis, saying, don't attack her, don't attack her.
[01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:20.196]  They arrest Mr. Tallis.
[01:12:20.676 --> 01:12:22.977]  They throw the book at him, try to get him to plea bargain.
[01:12:23.777 --> 01:12:28.720]  But then it came out that it was all staged in court and the New York Post had to retract.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:41.267]  So, if they're going into tea parties dressed up like Nazis to discredit us, or anybody that wants to audit the Fed, if they're provocateuring and trying to say you have bombs, I mean, this is what they do on the local scale.
[01:12:41.527 --> 01:12:43.248]  But think about the international scale.
[01:12:43.288 --> 01:12:43.869]  Luke Radowsky.
[01:12:44.684 --> 01:12:47.646]  Yes, they definitely are doing false flag attacks.
[01:12:47.666 --> 01:12:49.026]  They've been doing it throughout history.
[01:12:49.307 --> 01:12:56.631]  But we have to expose 9-11, Oklahoma City, the 93 World Trade Center bombings, to tell everybody that these are false flags.
[01:12:56.711 --> 01:13:03.395]  And the more we expose false flags, the less likelihood of another false flag happening here in America is going to happen.
[01:13:03.655 --> 01:13:07.477]  And we have to reiterate, you know, we are peaceful, non-violent protesters.
[01:13:07.877 --> 01:13:16.520]  Separately, the Southern Poverty Law Center, who was running Elohim City that McVeigh was at, that's come out in federal documents, they are listing you and I in their most wanted list.
[01:13:36.636 --> 01:13:42.639]  The headline for me is, Telling Tall Tales, Alex Jones 36, he's out to save the world.
[01:13:42.939 --> 01:13:44.060]  I'm telling tall tales.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.001]  I read the New York Times when they indict Goldman Sachs.
[01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:55.106]  And then it says, The Patriot Journalist, Luke Rudowsky 23, and they've got us in here as these deadly dangerous demons.
[01:13:56.207 --> 01:13:58.950]  They call us right wingers, but we're not right at all.
[01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:06.577]  I don't even understand why Glenn Beck was in there when Glenn Beck is pretty much a spokesperson for the establishment only doing it for his money.
[01:14:06.998 --> 01:14:10.161]  And we're out here fighting for freedom, liberty, sovereignty.
[01:14:10.781 --> 01:14:15.926]  And we're doing what the founding fathers did in this country, and they're calling us extremists, enablers.
[01:14:15.966 --> 01:14:17.888]  I mean, we are here fighting for freedom.
[01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:19.390]  We are here standing up.
[01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:20.611]  And to have
[01:14:20.991 --> 01:14:21.472]  I don't know.
[01:14:36.516 --> 01:14:39.118]  Alright, let's shift gears now into Colbert.
[01:14:39.158 --> 01:14:57.752]  This is an example of how anybody can go to Bill Maher's TV show, or Colbert's show, or David Letterman's show, or anywhere where there's media cameras, when NBC's live on the streets, whatever, and reach out to millions of people.
[01:14:58.073 --> 01:14:59.694]  Tell folks what happened with Stephen Colbert.
[01:15:00.342 --> 01:15:04.603]  I mean, we went to the show before, and he does a little question and answer, so you know I had my hand up.
[01:15:04.683 --> 01:15:09.304]  I talked to him, and the video that you guys see on YouTube is actually half of the conversation.
[01:15:09.904 --> 01:15:13.325]  They wouldn't let us film, so we filmed as much as we could of the conversation.
[01:15:13.585 --> 01:15:17.767]  We talked to him, and I'm telling you, I talked to other people in the mainstream media.
[01:15:17.827 --> 01:15:24.028]  I mean, chief editors of the New York Times, Brian Williams, Lou Dobbs, Paul Zahn, and so on and so on.
[01:15:24.288 --> 01:15:27.249]  And whenever we bring up Bilderberg, they hide and they run away from it.
[01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.911]  But Stephen, you know, he said, yeah, he knows about it.
[01:15:29.931 --> 01:15:35.817]  He actually even talked about the Bohemian Grove, how billionaires, you know, run around naked and worship stone owls.
[01:15:35.917 --> 01:15:37.439]  He even talked about that with us.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.601]  And then he actually shouted out, he did.
[01:15:39.921 --> 01:15:44.106]  When's the last time somebody in mainstream media ever brought up the Bilderberg Rule?
[01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.068]  Well, he did it just a couple days ago.
[01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.209]  Millions and millions of viewers.
[01:15:48.289 --> 01:15:51.250]  Many people who have never heard of the subject will look it up on Google.
[01:15:51.310 --> 01:16:03.494]  It's a huge success for InfoWars and it's amazing seeing somebody from the mainstream actually get it and actually know what's going on and actually mention it on his TV show because the issues we're talking about is serious.
[01:16:03.814 --> 01:16:06.335]  You get harassed, I get harassed.
[01:16:06.455 --> 01:16:10.796]  And all these other journalists who have the cojones to actually go after and talk about these elites.
[01:16:11.889 --> 01:16:12.670]  We are targeted.
[01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:13.372]  We are harassed.
[01:16:13.752 --> 01:16:18.281]  And to have somebody like Stephen Colbert just send out that message to millions of people is an amazing thing.
[01:16:18.817 --> 01:16:19.718]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:16:20.338 --> 01:16:26.324]  Just ten years ago, the news would write headlines saying, it's a conspiracy theory, Bilderberg doesn't exist.
[01:16:26.444 --> 01:16:41.797]  Now, Financial Times of London, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, hundreds of publications a month say, yeah, world government's real, it needs to be authoritarian to save the planet, and we have been building it in secret, and it's a good thing.
[01:16:43.178 --> 01:16:50.301]  So they've gone from denying it existed to saying, yeah, it exists, but it's tyrannical for your own good.
[01:16:50.562 --> 01:17:00.266]  But then separately, the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center will write articles saying you're dangerous and violent when you've never said that, just because you're saying, I don't want to be a global corporate slave.
[01:17:01.479 --> 01:17:04.421]  We're standing up for humanity right now.
[01:17:34.003 --> 01:17:38.289]  Absolutely, and I say this a lot and I'll say it again, the denial is over!
[01:17:39.212 --> 01:17:47.114]  I mean, I'm here scanning over the Southern Poverty Law Center article demonizing us and others, and they just keep saying we're kooks that believe in a world government.
[01:17:47.574 --> 01:17:49.634]  I mean, world government's being announced everywhere.
[01:17:49.674 --> 01:17:51.214]  The banks are robbing everyone.
[01:17:51.494 --> 01:17:53.215]  This isn't going to work.
[01:17:53.255 --> 01:18:03.697]  When they stage a new Oklahoma City, which clearly they're programming the public to blame us when it happens, when they stage it, it's not going to go the way it went last time when the feds blew up OKC.
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:13.702]  It's definitely not because there's so many people waking up every single day because of your documentaries, because of our work as well, that we're not going to stand for it.
[01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:14.963]  It's not going to work.
[01:18:15.043 --> 01:18:19.764]  And the more we expose it, the less likely it is of them doing it is going to happen.
[01:18:19.784 --> 01:18:21.285]  So we have to fight for our freedoms.
[01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:29.627]  Remember 9-11, we're going to be out there this year on the 9th anniversary building towards the 10th anniversary of 9-11 standing at ground zero with death.
[01:18:29.927 --> 01:18:30.087]  Yeah.
[01:19:00.808 --> 01:19:10.257]  And again, if people just take my films, and if they just make copies of them, and if they just hold public viewings, it'll pack out.
[01:19:10.377 --> 01:19:11.959]  I mean, you build it, they will come.
[01:19:11.979 --> 01:19:15.462]  I mean, look, look at you, three, four years ago, getting involved.
[01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:20.225]  We Are Change two and a half, three years ago, and look at the effect you've had.
[01:19:20.745 --> 01:19:24.047]  Everyone can do that if they have the truth and have the passion.
[01:19:24.487 --> 01:19:30.330]  If folks go up to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, they can watch the Stephen Colbert video in full.
[01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:32.772]  You can also go to WeAreChange.org.
[01:19:32.852 --> 01:19:34.553]  WeAreChange.org.
[01:19:34.593 --> 01:19:42.917]  When we come back, we're going to play some excerpts of Luke's talk with Stephen Colbert and then Colbert's live response once he went on television.
[01:19:43.177 --> 01:19:47.251]  We'll be right back with Luke Hradowski, then coming up, the false flag nuke attack.
[01:19:47.311 --> 01:19:48.053]  It's in the pike.
[01:19:48.073 --> 01:19:49.799]  They're going to try to blame it on the American people.
[01:19:52.193 --> 01:19:54.635]  And you're subject to public police action.
[01:19:54.715 --> 01:19:55.636]  Tyranny is here.
[01:19:55.997 --> 01:19:59.600]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.122]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:20:02.142 --> 01:20:07.588]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:20:08.008 --> 01:20:14.234]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:20:14.654 --> 01:20:20.239]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:20:20.659 --> 01:20:24.342]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic is falling.
[01:20:24.823 --> 01:20:28.946]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:20:29.107 --> 01:20:34.671]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:20:35.072 --> 01:20:38.034]  It's only the beginning of the Mural of Order's hellish plan.
[01:20:38.615 --> 01:20:40.076]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:20:40.596 --> 01:20:41.017]  It's here.

[01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:52.666]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[01:21:52.906 --> 01:21:58.069]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[01:21:58.309 --> 01:22:03.673]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:05.875]  The value of the U.S.
[01:22:05.915 --> 01:22:07.838]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[01:22:08.018 --> 01:22:11.062]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals.
[01:22:11.202 --> 01:22:12.463]  But you need to act today.

[01:22:21.855 --> 01:22:30.119]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[01:22:30.339 --> 01:22:41.404]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.
[01:22:41.424 --> 01:22:48.707]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a lifetime to establish.
[01:22:49.507 --> 01:22:56.593]  UtopiaSilver.com believes, as the Declaration of Independence states, that our rights come from God, not from government.
[01:22:56.794 --> 01:23:05.701]  The only lawful purpose of any government is to protect and secure the rights of the people, and no man or government has the authority to take what has been given to us by God.
[01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:09.144]  Among these rights are life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:23:09.424 --> 01:23:14.327]  And America's government has ceased to be the protector of liberty and of the people's God-given rights.
[01:23:14.547 --> 01:23:21.311]  But we the people can return America to greatness if we are willing to stand up and reassert our stolen rights.
[01:23:21.751 --> 01:23:25.613]  We ask that you join Utopia Silver in changing America's course in history.

[01:23:43.427 --> 01:23:43.607]  That's 888-213-4338.
[01:23:55.987 --> 01:23:59.030]  Everybody knows, ladies and gentlemen, the dice are loaded.
[01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:02.072]  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.
[01:24:02.713 --> 01:24:06.856]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:24:09.389 --> 01:24:10.830]  The war is over.
[01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:12.550]  The good guy's lost.
[01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:17.692]  But if we can identify the New World Order, we can defeat them and bring them down.
[01:24:17.712 --> 01:24:21.073]  Okay, so Luke's girlfriend started taping this about halfway in.
[01:24:21.113 --> 01:24:22.974]  This is him warming up the studio audience.
[01:24:23.514 --> 01:24:24.694]  He has a discussion with him.
[01:24:24.734 --> 01:24:28.916]  Colbert thinks he's talking about Bohemian Grove, which he has covered before.
[01:24:29.756 --> 01:24:34.397]  Making fun of the Republicans, running around naked, having gay sex, which is what they do.
[01:24:34.457 --> 01:24:36.238]  That's how crazy our elites are.
[01:24:37.658 --> 01:24:42.839]  And generally, the Republicans like men at the leadership levels, and the Democrats like women.
[01:24:43.099 --> 01:24:47.461]  That's not a total rule, like with Barney Frank, but it's very strange.
[01:24:48.281 --> 01:24:49.261]  But this is separate.
[01:24:49.281 --> 01:24:51.041]  This is an elite political meeting.
[01:24:51.402 --> 01:24:52.662]  Bilderberg, here it is.
[01:24:53.442 --> 01:25:00.846]  Sonia Sotomayor, uh, the wise Latina herself, um, complained that she wasn't allowed to be in, uh, two years, uh, last year.
[01:25:01.286 --> 01:25:01.526]  Yeah.
[01:25:01.646 --> 01:25:02.347]  That's the Bushy Mean Grove.
[01:25:02.367 --> 01:25:02.747]  Do you remember?
[01:25:03.267 --> 01:25:03.848]  You get me in?
[01:25:03.948 --> 01:25:04.968]  I'm actually a journalist.
[01:25:05.068 --> 01:25:06.489]  I get death threats for covering it.
[01:25:06.929 --> 01:25:07.710]  You get death threats?
[01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:08.030]  Yes.
[01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.910]  Do you have letters or anything?
[01:25:09.111 --> 01:25:09.851]  The mainstream media.
[01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:10.671]  Do you have letters?
[01:25:10.851 --> 01:25:11.632]  I have phone calls.
[01:25:11.672 --> 01:25:12.672]  You have phone calls?
[01:25:12.692 --> 01:25:12.813]  Yes.
[01:25:12.853 --> 01:25:14.593]  You have your recordings of these phone calls?
[01:25:14.674 --> 01:25:15.894]  I record some of them, yes.
[01:25:16.775 --> 01:25:17.655]  What do they say?
[01:25:17.675 --> 01:25:19.976]  What do you think they're going to say?
[01:25:20.036 --> 01:25:22.678]  And you remain secret by killing a journalist.
[01:25:24.093 --> 01:25:25.934]  Why would they kill a journalist?
[01:25:25.974 --> 01:25:30.717]  We actually confront Bilderberg members like Bill Clinton, the IMF had, the World Bank had.
[01:25:30.757 --> 01:25:32.498]  We actually confront them on video cameras.
[01:25:32.718 --> 01:25:34.599]  And we tell them, what do you do at these meetings?
[01:25:34.679 --> 01:25:35.400]  And they run away.
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:36.861]  Like we have everything on video.
[01:25:37.301 --> 01:25:38.602]  And it's the world's elites.
[01:25:40.333 --> 01:25:43.514]  If I was a billionaire one of these days, I'd just be naked all the time.
[01:25:43.534 --> 01:25:44.955]  They worship a big stone owl.
[01:25:44.995 --> 01:25:46.156]  That's the Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:46.216 --> 01:25:49.437]  The Bilderberg Group is different than the Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:49.857 --> 01:25:51.458]  The Bilderberg Group is more secret.
[01:25:51.498 --> 01:25:53.179]  It's not a little vacation.
[01:25:53.579 --> 01:25:54.499]  It's the one group.
[01:25:58.526 --> 01:26:11.021]  Now, we weren't allowed to film, so I'm sorry for the video quality, but we have to condescendingly film in the middle of our conversation.
[01:26:11.962 --> 01:26:15.727]  But, you know, after the conversation I had with Steven,
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.502]  He goes and sits down and he does his news segment.
[01:26:19.562 --> 01:26:24.166]  And in the middle of his news segment, he just goes off and says... Everybody, thank you for joining us.
[01:26:24.286 --> 01:26:26.308]  I just want to thank you for the welcome you just gave me.
[01:26:26.328 --> 01:26:43.302]  And I just want to say that anybody out there watching, that if you're in the secret Bilderberg group... Please don't assassinate freelance reporters.
[01:26:44.514 --> 01:26:45.696]  It's just not nice, guys.
[01:26:45.736 --> 01:26:46.557]  It's not nice.
[01:26:48.139 --> 01:26:49.120]  And please call me.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:49.660]  Call me.
[01:26:51.222 --> 01:26:52.023]  The only one, buddy.
[01:26:52.123 --> 01:26:52.584]  Okay.
[01:26:53.465 --> 01:26:54.286]  Ha ha ha.
[01:26:54.827 --> 01:26:56.449]  He seems like a pretty nice guy, doesn't he?
[01:26:57.503 --> 01:27:02.766]  Very good, a good guy, and he mentioned, you know, Skull and Bones and the Bohemian Grove before on his show.
[01:27:03.227 --> 01:27:06.249]  So I think just anybody going out there, anybody could do it.
[01:27:06.289 --> 01:27:14.274]  You just have to go out there, talk to these people like they're human beings, and having that conversation, having that dialogue, and not being afraid to speak truth.
[01:27:14.754 --> 01:27:17.576]  It's so important, and it just shows that anybody could do this.
[01:27:17.916 --> 01:27:22.699]  The power we have to reach out to millions is within you, and we can do anything, and nothing is impossible.
[01:27:22.879 --> 01:27:29.802]  And importantly, We Are Change and myself going back over more than a decade, I always am nice.
[01:27:29.902 --> 01:27:37.946]  Like when I asked George Bush a question and he had me arrested when he was governor at a press conference, I was very polite until they started grabbing me and dragging me out.
[01:27:37.966 --> 01:27:40.607]  And I was still polite so they wouldn't have an excuse to beat me up.
[01:27:41.107 --> 01:27:48.290]  But like with Al Gore when Chicago We Are Change, they were nice at first, and then when they started dragging him out, then they got the info out and were loud.
[01:27:48.791 --> 01:27:50.151]  And so it's just very important.
[01:27:50.171 --> 01:27:51.252]  It's like Karl Rove
[01:27:51.992 --> 01:27:52.172]  I think?
[01:28:11.505 --> 01:28:11.945]  I don't
[01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:45.702]  It is the most single important thing somebody could do because we not only send them a message that we as the people are waking up we know and we will tolerate this, but also showing the world how
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.763]  These people are not as powerful as they seem.
[01:28:56.983 --> 01:29:06.534]  They're not as strong, because when you come up to them, when you talk to them, when you look them in their eyes, and you tell them about their crimes and their wrongs that they committed against the people, they cower.
[01:29:06.594 --> 01:29:07.375]  They run away.
[01:29:07.395 --> 01:29:10.319]  It's like cockroaches running away when you turn on the light.
[01:29:10.619 --> 01:29:14.604]  And I'm telling you, we confronted Karl Rove before, and we were very nice to him in the beginning.
[01:29:15.044 --> 01:29:25.929]  And as soon as you ignore me and don't want to answer questions about how he met with the financer of Osama bin Laden before and after President Bush's election, we're going to go after you.
[01:29:25.949 --> 01:29:31.471]  And that's what we did in our YouTube video that's gotten thousands and thousands of hits on YouTube.
[01:29:32.051 --> 01:29:33.852]  Look, look, look, stay there, stay there.
[01:29:33.912 --> 01:29:35.352]  Let's finish up on the other side.
[01:29:36.533 --> 01:29:39.714]  Also up on InfoWars.com, we've got some key info.
[01:29:40.595 --> 01:29:41.495]  We're on the march.
[01:29:41.975 --> 01:29:43.516]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.506 --> 01:29:47.289]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:53.274]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:29:53.675 --> 01:29:58.639]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.721]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:00.741 --> 01:30:05.866]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:06.066 --> 01:30:07.027]  How much do you want?
[01:30:07.247 --> 01:30:07.968]  When do you want it?
[01:30:08.348 --> 01:30:09.950]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:10.231 --> 01:30:11.052]  When will you need it?
[01:30:11.312 --> 01:30:13.375]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:13.515 --> 01:30:14.616]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:14.856 --> 01:30:16.178]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:16.378 --> 01:30:21.445]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:21.645 --> 01:30:24.769]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:25.209 --> 01:30:28.711]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:29.032 --> 01:30:30.012]  How much will you need?
[01:30:30.272 --> 01:30:30.893]  We don't know.
[01:30:31.173 --> 01:30:32.073]  How much do you want?
[01:30:32.274 --> 01:30:33.014]  All you can get.
[01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.055]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:37.057]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:37.357 --> 01:30:39.518]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:39.538 --> 01:30:40.559]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:50.965 --> 01:30:59.067]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:30:59.427 --> 01:31:09.870]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:15.752]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:31:16.312 --> 01:31:20.795]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:31:21.215 --> 01:31:29.961]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:31:30.281 --> 01:31:40.108]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:31:40.388 --> 01:31:43.590]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:44.071 --> 01:31:45.091]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:31:46.032 --> 01:31:46.128]  Yeah.
[01:31:50.317 --> 01:31:51.978]  Oh, my sinuses!
[01:31:52.038 --> 01:31:53.938]  They feel like they'll explode!
[01:31:53.978 --> 01:31:54.659]  Sinus pressure.
[01:31:54.799 --> 01:31:56.479]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[01:31:56.579 --> 01:31:57.720]  You've struggled for years.
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:03.482]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[01:32:03.682 --> 01:32:04.282]  Sound familiar?
[01:32:04.422 --> 01:32:05.242]  Well, you're not alone.
[01:32:05.482 --> 01:32:08.943]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:13.965]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[01:32:14.165 --> 01:32:16.606]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor-recommended.
[01:32:16.826 --> 01:32:19.327]  Sinofresh homeopathic antiseptic nasal spray.
[01:32:19.487 --> 01:32:19.787]  It's the only
[01:32:19.827 --> 01:32:24.528]  Only patent-protected nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of your sinusitis.
[01:32:24.808 --> 01:32:28.929]  No alcohol, no rebound congestion, no drug interactions, and easy to use.
[01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:31.069]  Don't go another day just treating symptoms.
[01:32:31.269 --> 01:32:35.910]  Take control of your sinus health now and get Sinofresh Homeopathic Antiseptic Nasal Spray.

[01:32:55.632 --> 01:32:57.534]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:58.014 --> 01:33:00.796]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:02.117 --> 01:33:05.520]  You know I'm pretty good friends with Jesse Ventura and I never even call him.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.043]  Generally he ends up calling up asking how I'm doing or his crew does.
[01:33:09.624 --> 01:33:15.328]  I'm gonna be a consultant on his second season of Conspiracy Theory and also I'm gonna appear in more episodes.
[01:33:16.553 --> 01:33:20.415]  And I need to reach out to these people because I get so busy, years just flash by.
[01:33:20.455 --> 01:33:21.155]  It happens to everybody.
[01:33:21.555 --> 01:33:24.517]  Willie Nelson, I haven't talked to Willie probably about a year on the phone.
[01:33:24.957 --> 01:33:28.179]  He called me about, I don't know, two and a half years ago.
[01:33:28.399 --> 01:33:30.740]  They said, Willie Nelson's calling here at the office.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:32.821]  He lives here in Austin.
[01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:35.682]  And I'd met him once at one of my film screenings.
[01:33:36.683 --> 01:33:37.963]  Here comes Willie Nelson walking up.
[01:33:38.524 --> 01:33:39.904]  And I said, I'd like to interview you sometime.
[01:33:39.944 --> 01:33:41.705]  He said, yeah, sometime we'll do that.
[01:33:41.725 --> 01:33:43.066]  I just gave him my number.
[01:33:43.546 --> 01:33:44.927]  Then about six months later, he called me.
[01:33:47.776 --> 01:33:48.996]  That was at an in-game screening.
[01:33:49.016 --> 01:33:50.156]  That's how long ago that was.
[01:33:51.237 --> 01:33:54.317]  And then of course he came on the show and went public for 9-11 truth.
[01:33:54.437 --> 01:33:56.778]  I didn't even intend for him to do that.
[01:33:57.678 --> 01:33:59.138]  I guess that's why he wanted to come on.
[01:33:59.678 --> 01:34:01.459]  Well, he was on Larry King Friday night.
[01:34:01.519 --> 01:34:02.159]  I just learned this.
[01:34:02.219 --> 01:34:03.759]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:04.899 --> 01:34:09.520]  And I want to play this after Luke leaves because Larry King says, well, the buildings fell because they were hit by a jet.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.801]  And Willie had just said building 7 wasn't hit by a jet.
[01:34:15.678 --> 01:34:17.839]  And the government now admits it did fall at free fall.
[01:34:17.859 --> 01:34:19.540]  You can see the blast points.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.441]  It's so incredible, folks.
[01:34:22.481 --> 01:34:24.162]  I mean, they blew up Oklahoma City.
[01:34:24.442 --> 01:34:26.543]  The former head of Air Force Weapons Development went there.
[01:34:26.743 --> 01:34:30.584]  There were columns further back in the building blown out with blast points on them.
[01:34:30.825 --> 01:34:34.606]  And Parton went over and showed from the photos the perfect blast points.
[01:34:35.487 --> 01:34:37.768]  I mean, it had demolition blast points on it.
[01:34:38.508 --> 01:34:43.150]  And they used Controlled Demolition Incorporated to come in and destroy the wreckage and haul it off under guard.
[01:34:44.656 --> 01:34:46.577]  And the same thing was done with the wreckage of 9-11.
[01:34:47.257 --> 01:34:48.537]  Going back to Luke Radowsky.
[01:34:48.617 --> 01:34:59.261]  Folks, if we let them kill Kennedy in broad daylight in front of us, if we let them carry out 9-11 in broad daylight in front of us, this private global corporate group that runs our country, they're going to steal our pension funds.
[01:34:59.281 --> 01:35:00.861]  Now they're saying that's what they want to do.
[01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:04.003]  I read documents six years ago where they were getting ready to do it.
[01:35:04.283 --> 01:35:05.883]  Now they're saying they're getting ready to do it.
[01:35:06.123 --> 01:35:07.784]  They're not going to give us any quarter.
[01:35:07.984 --> 01:35:13.206]  They're not going to back off until we finally grow up and admit just how evil this elite is.
[01:35:13.246 --> 01:35:13.826]  Luke Radowsky.
[01:35:14.676 --> 01:35:19.981]  I mean, the future that we want for this country and for ourselves and for our lives is in our hands.
[01:35:20.301 --> 01:35:22.143]  There's nothing stopping us but ourselves.
[01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:23.584]  But we have to believe in ourselves.
[01:35:23.604 --> 01:35:24.765]  We have to fight for ourselves.
[01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:31.392]  Holding little community town hall meetings like we do here in New York City every Saturday is very critical in reaching out to the community.
[01:35:31.632 --> 01:35:34.394]  We're also raising food for the homeless.
[01:35:34.414 --> 01:35:35.495]  We're going to be feeding the homeless.
[01:35:35.515 --> 01:35:40.380]  So anybody coming to the premiere of Police Day 4 this Saturday, please bring food here in New York City.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.902]  It's about being the change that you want to see in this world and actually doing it.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:16.043]  And if there's any doubt this government stages terror attacks, it's not our government, it's illegitimate.
[01:36:16.703 --> 01:36:29.329]  Look at how they're framing the Patriot movement saying we're calling for violence and that we don't like black people with no evidence and then we catch them posing as Nazis at our rallies to make us look bad.
[01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:32.211]  That's only a microcosm of the bigger picture.
[01:36:32.611 --> 01:36:36.153]  They're the bad guys, they have to frame us as the bad guys.
[01:36:37.213 --> 01:36:38.695]  Exactly, and that's what criminals do.
[01:36:38.975 --> 01:36:51.347]  They cover up their crimes and they try to point somebody else as the evil villain, when in all reality, the people who are spawning and doing all these false flags and doing all these provocateur attacks, they're the ones who are covering something up.
[01:36:51.648 --> 01:36:57.113]  So we have to see it for what it is, call out provocateurs, and make sure people know what we stand for, and keep telling them.
[01:36:57.373 --> 01:36:57.934]  This is about
[01:36:58.558 --> 01:37:00.859]  Okay, here's an example of what you can do.
[01:37:20.845 --> 01:37:22.186]  Here's an example of what you can do.
[01:37:22.526 --> 01:37:26.028]  Luke, in the film Truth Rising, the DVD available at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:26.048 --> 01:37:26.808]  People need to see this.
[01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:29.129]  It's all about We Are Change at 9-11 Truth.
[01:37:29.549 --> 01:37:36.653]  Just one example of the Hart-Rubin Commission head, Gary Hart, top globalist,
[01:37:38.024 --> 01:37:42.548]  And he wrote a letter to Iran saying, our government will stage terror attacks and blame it on you.
[01:37:42.588 --> 01:37:43.709]  You better do what we're saying.
[01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:51.696]  And then when you went to him, we are changed with the letter, he tried to deny that he'd written it till you gave it to him.
[01:37:51.716 --> 01:37:53.978]  And he said, OK, I did write it and then admitted it.
[01:37:54.238 --> 01:37:59.440]  See, if you can't even address them as an adult to an adult, they won't even take you seriously.
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:03.062]  They automatically lie to you until you say, look, I know who you are.
[01:38:03.382 --> 01:38:04.762]  Then they'll have a real discussion.
[01:38:05.022 --> 01:38:06.923]  I mean, that's how dumb they think we are.
[01:38:06.963 --> 01:38:15.546]  He wrote a public letter basically admitting they staged 9-11 and that they'll stage more events to Iran, thinking we're so dumb.
[01:38:16.847 --> 01:38:19.028]  That's what Bill Clinton did Friday on Larry King Live.
[01:38:19.898 --> 01:38:22.961]  Or was, not Larry King live, it was on CNN with Wolf Blitzer.
[01:38:23.381 --> 01:38:28.506]  He basically said, gee I hope there doesn't have to be another tower attack to shut up the tea parties.
[01:38:28.827 --> 01:38:29.988]  That's an open threat.
[01:38:30.028 --> 01:38:31.549]  They're going to do this and blame it on us.
[01:38:31.569 --> 01:38:34.032]  Luke Rudowsky, tell folks about the Gary Hart incident.
[01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:40.733]  Gary Hart was a beautiful confrontation where he actually lied and denied saying that the U.S.
[01:38:40.753 --> 01:38:43.717]  government would do a false flag to get into a war with Iran.
[01:38:43.757 --> 01:38:45.058]  He said he never wrote a letter.
[01:38:45.498 --> 01:38:49.523]  And then Brian Kenney, we are changed here, brought out the letter and read it to him.
[01:38:49.903 --> 01:38:54.228]  Actually read the letter to him when he denied that that letter even existed.
[01:38:54.588 --> 01:38:56.389]  People can go see that video on YouTube now.
[01:38:56.749 --> 01:39:01.012]  And then he just pretty much admitted and said, yeah, I'm pretty much saying that the U.S.
[01:39:01.052 --> 01:39:04.594]  government would do something like a false flag to get an award with Iran.
[01:39:04.855 --> 01:39:06.456]  Those are his own words.
[01:39:07.096 --> 01:39:08.677]  And he tried to lie about it.
[01:39:08.717 --> 01:39:10.938]  He tried to lie about his New World Order comments.
[01:39:10.958 --> 01:39:11.919]  We asked him what it meant.
[01:39:12.439 --> 01:39:14.701]  And we said that he said it a couple times.
[01:39:15.201 --> 01:39:18.423]  He just went off on a tangent saying, no, I only said it once.
[01:39:18.823 --> 01:39:19.604]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:39:19.824 --> 01:39:26.405]  And then he started stammering and stuttering and profusely sweating, because it's just like the movie, They Live.
[01:39:27.485 --> 01:39:31.106]  He almost got his watch and said, I got one that can see.
[01:39:31.166 --> 01:39:32.586]  I got a bunch of them that can see.
[01:39:33.426 --> 01:39:34.687]  He suddenly got scared.
[01:39:35.167 --> 01:39:39.928]  He was in a room of people, because for those that don't know, he helped plan some of the 9-11 stuff.
[01:39:40.388 --> 01:39:45.309]  He wrote the Heart Rubbin Commission, calling for a big event that would bring in a new world order.
[01:39:45.349 --> 01:39:47.309]  We need to use this disaster for a new world order.
[01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:56.614]  And he wrote this public letter, posted it on the Huffington Post, and then tried to deny to you, but once you gave him the letter, he said, okay, I did write the letter.
[01:39:57.035 --> 01:39:58.175]  And then he started sweating.
[01:39:58.756 --> 01:40:01.197]  I mean, again, they think we're all dumb.
[01:40:01.657 --> 01:40:10.203]  And it's not because we're dumb, it's because we're focused on petty issues, or we're cowardly, and won't stand up to these maggots and let them know that we're aware of what they're doing.
[01:40:10.942 --> 01:40:14.644]  And we're here to make everybody know there's no reason to fear anything.
[01:40:14.964 --> 01:40:15.845]  It's our courage.
[01:40:16.145 --> 01:40:18.887]  It's our love and persistence that will change things.
[01:40:19.167 --> 01:40:29.373]  And sending a message out to the world in a YouTube video showing how these people lie to us is critically important, but also sending them a message face-to-face, eye-to-eye, that we know your game.
[01:40:29.613 --> 01:40:30.513]  We're not stupid.
[01:40:30.713 --> 01:40:31.974]  We're not going to go along with it.
[01:40:32.234 --> 01:40:38.398]  Send them a message, and they will have to think twice before they ever even plan or say anything publicly.
[01:40:38.738 --> 01:40:45.382]  Because they know that the people of this country, the people of this world are waking up to that bull crap and they're seeing it for what it is.
[01:40:45.703 --> 01:40:52.087]  We can see we're not stupid, we're not animals, we are human beings and our lives are just as important as their lives are.
[01:40:52.327 --> 01:41:00.672]  And we have to make everybody understand that because that is the true success of humanity is knowing that we are all equal, we are all human beings and nobody should rule over us.
[01:41:01.012 --> 01:41:07.957]  We are the true people of this world and we shall live our lives without being intruded and bothered by these global elites who
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:19.965]  Exactly, they can't plan world events unless we sit on our butts and aren't involved in the world.
[01:41:20.245 --> 01:41:25.149]  We have to take the world back with little actions, but together it can move mountains.
[01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:28.870]  And again, your video's only been up about a day and a half, 24,000 views.
[01:41:29.490 --> 01:41:30.951]  It's up at WeAreChange.org.
[01:41:31.011 --> 01:41:32.872]  It's also up at Infowars.com.
[01:41:33.312 --> 01:41:35.273]  It's also up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:35.653 --> 01:41:45.336]  It is so important to get this Colbert video out because all these Colbert listeners and viewers will now go look in the Bilderberg Group and find our information.
[01:41:45.636 --> 01:41:47.017]  Luke, keep up the great work.
[01:41:47.037 --> 01:41:48.398]  Appreciate you joining us today.
[01:41:48.958 --> 01:41:49.518]  God bless you.
[01:41:49.558 --> 01:41:50.578]  Thank you, Alex, so much.
[01:41:50.658 --> 01:41:51.419]  And we're going to win this.
[01:41:51.539 --> 01:41:52.159]  I know we will.
[01:41:52.659 --> 01:41:52.979]  We are.
[01:41:53.039 --> 01:41:53.980]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:59.251]  Now, Luke is another testament.
[01:42:00.211 --> 01:42:03.612]  I remember three years ago, 9-11 Truth, New York.
[01:42:04.272 --> 01:42:06.453]  Pretty good folks, but some questionable things.
[01:42:06.473 --> 01:42:07.993]  They didn't want us fighting the New World Order.
[01:42:08.073 --> 01:42:10.934]  They didn't want to talk about the CFR eugenics.
[01:42:11.854 --> 01:42:13.975]  And Luke got basically kicked out of the group.
[01:42:14.375 --> 01:42:15.615]  And he was the guy that was really building it.
[01:42:15.955 --> 01:42:17.796]  And I told Luke, I said, Luke, don't quit.
[01:42:18.717 --> 01:42:19.478]  Get a good name.
[01:42:19.918 --> 01:42:21.019]  Start a new organization.
[01:42:21.099 --> 01:42:22.000]  I'll have you on the air.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.042]  I'll support you, just like I support all the other real activists.
[01:42:25.483 --> 01:42:29.066]  If you don't see us promoting somebody, word of the wise is sufficient.
[01:42:30.207 --> 01:42:32.509]  And you live, you learn.
[01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:37.293]  But Luke, just with an idea, I said, don't be centralized.
[01:42:38.414 --> 01:42:40.155]  Luke woke up watching my Police State films.
[01:42:41.038 --> 01:42:46.519]  And then see, he's waking up people, and then they're becoming leaders, and then they're gonna wake up people who become leaders, who wake up people.
[01:42:46.819 --> 01:42:50.040]  This is how we take the planet back from the clutches of the globalists.
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:52.800]  This is how we do it.
[01:42:55.141 --> 01:43:05.663]  And God will open doors for you if you just have the faith, take action, are confident, and tell the truth, and stand in the face of evil, stand up against the New World Order.
[01:43:06.623 --> 01:43:07.223]  It's incredible.
[01:43:08.467 --> 01:43:20.797]  And I told Luke, I said, have it be decentralized, just a code of ideas to go out and confront politicians, and to go out and expose 9-11, and expose global warming, and expose the New World Order, because that was what he wanted to do.
[01:43:21.497 --> 01:43:24.520]  And now, it's We Are Change that taught the world.
[01:43:25.697 --> 01:43:27.417]  How to go out and confront Al Gore.
[01:43:27.457 --> 01:43:28.758]  Now the Tea Parties are copying it.
[01:43:29.138 --> 01:43:36.100]  See, and now there's all these other groups and organizations that go to these public events and shout down the New World Order.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.200]  Something I was doing 14 years ago.
[01:43:40.621 --> 01:43:41.801]  Everybody can do this.
[01:43:41.901 --> 01:43:43.942]  You know, Karl Rove's coming into town tonight.
[01:43:43.982 --> 01:43:44.802]  People need to be there.
[01:43:46.103 --> 01:43:49.463]  I've confronted Bill Clinton and Janet Reno and everybody at UT.
[01:43:49.884 --> 01:43:51.344]  You need to go down there and confront them.
[01:43:52.495 --> 01:43:56.337]  I've gone and been physically attacked confronting MSNBC and Chris Matthews.
[01:43:58.478 --> 01:44:12.046]  I wouldn't stop bullhorning, that's why, but I took over the whole hour of TV and then when they broke my bullhorn with a knife, cut the wire, Luke showed up even bigger and we put him on top of this huge guy's shoulders, so Luke was about nine and a half feet in the air.
[01:44:17.242 --> 01:44:17.963]  Oh, it's amazing.
[01:44:18.943 --> 01:44:20.945]  Okay, I want to go to this Willie Nelson clip.
[01:44:20.965 --> 01:44:27.851]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and notice how Larry King brings up 9-11 Truth to him because it was in a Twitter.
[01:44:28.171 --> 01:44:29.192]  He's reading Twitters to him.
[01:44:32.608 --> 01:44:39.033]  Willie talks about Building 7 not hit by a plane, not hit by the debris of Tower 1 or 2, falling in its own footprint.
[01:44:39.053 --> 01:44:44.337]  And we have the CNN footage of firefighters and police saying, get back, they're bringing it down.
[01:44:44.357 --> 01:44:46.338]  And we're not saying they were involved.
[01:44:46.378 --> 01:44:47.679]  They were told, get back, they're bringing it down.
[01:44:47.699 --> 01:44:50.421]  We've had police officers on the show who heard the countdown.
[01:44:50.441 --> 01:44:50.421]  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:51.422]  Boom!
[01:44:51.442 --> 01:44:52.042]  This is the reality.
[01:45:00.618 --> 01:45:10.284]  And we have, before she even had her national TV show, Amy Goodman was down there, and she's there when the same cops who we've interviewed, and we've interviewed the people that are on the video, we went and found them.
[01:45:11.325 --> 01:45:15.887]  And you see her, and they're telling her to get out of there, and she runs, and then boom!
[01:45:15.927 --> 01:45:17.468]  Building 7 comes down.
[01:45:17.488 --> 01:45:19.930]  I don't have to go through all the evidence of 9-11.
[01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:27.895]  If you have been told to hate 9-11 truth, also, he says, well there was also an investigation, Larry King says, well there was also an investigation of 9-11 truth.
[01:45:31.755 --> 01:45:36.779]  Yes, and six of the ten commission members appointed by Bush have said it's a criminal cover-up.
[01:45:37.059 --> 01:45:38.901]  So has Farmer, the head lawyer.
[01:45:40.342 --> 01:45:46.066]  I mean, it just came out three weeks ago, the ACLU sued and got it, where Dick Cheney ordered the commission to not look at the attacks.
[01:45:46.086 --> 01:45:47.668]  In fact, let's pull that up.
[01:45:47.968 --> 01:45:50.750]  White House ordered commission not to look at 9-11 attacks.
[01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:52.351]  They weren't allowed to look at the evidence.
[01:45:53.793 --> 01:45:54.773]  It was a whitewash.
[01:45:55.414 --> 01:45:57.556]  We must have a new independent investigation.
[01:45:57.896 --> 01:45:59.177]  But here is Willie Nelson.
[01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:08.231]  Okay, hey, I don't know why it's always in this fourth hour.
[01:46:08.271 --> 01:46:13.054]  It's like a jinx or a genie or a gremlin in the equipment.
[01:46:13.394 --> 01:46:14.995]  But we're going to start it over this time.
[01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:15.835]  Here it is, folks.
[01:46:17.096 --> 01:46:18.817]  But he's questioned the official story.
[01:46:19.237 --> 01:46:23.019]  What prompted you to look into this from another angle?
[01:46:23.639 --> 01:46:25.300]  Well, just logic.
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:28.221]  I've seen buildings implode before.
[01:46:28.261 --> 01:46:31.563]  I just saw the Texas Stadium implode just a couple of days ago.
[01:46:33.144 --> 01:46:34.585]  And these two buildings imploded.
[01:46:35.874 --> 01:46:42.760]  And the one next to it, where nothing hit it, no plane hit the one next to it, it just decided to fall on its own.
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:44.922]  So naturally, I have questions about how that happened.
[01:46:44.942 --> 01:46:46.463]  You think something was done inside?
[01:46:46.543 --> 01:46:46.763]  Yes.
[01:46:46.783 --> 01:46:47.064]  Right.
[01:46:47.584 --> 01:46:56.411]  But I'm told that the reason it imploded was so much heat from above and so much fuel on the jets that that caused it to go down rather than go over.
[01:46:56.952 --> 01:47:01.876]  Never before has a building collapsed because it was hit by an airplane, a steel building.
[01:47:02.016 --> 01:47:03.077]  Never before.
[01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:06.636]  Has any building been hit by 747 though?
[01:47:09.116 --> 01:47:09.937]  I'm sure they have.
[01:47:10.517 --> 01:47:14.060]  So you think there was something going on inside the building?
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:16.342]  Well, I just questioned the whole thing.
[01:47:16.362 --> 01:47:18.524]  I questioned the story.
[01:47:18.624 --> 01:47:20.525]  I questioned the implosions.
[01:47:21.466 --> 01:47:24.168]  It just looks too simple, you know?
[01:47:24.809 --> 01:47:27.751]  Well, others have questioned it, too, although there was an investigation.
[01:47:28.172 --> 01:47:30.594]  There was an investigation, and I think there should be more.
[01:47:31.274 --> 01:47:33.716]  Willie Nelson, another tweet to King Things.
[01:47:34.197 --> 01:47:34.697]  King Things.
[01:47:34.757 --> 01:47:35.618]  How many guitars?
[01:47:36.755 --> 01:47:37.615]  So there you have it.
[01:47:37.796 --> 01:47:38.696]  Here's raw story.
[01:47:38.716 --> 01:47:42.218]  It was also in the Associated Press but never became national news on television.
[01:47:42.598 --> 01:47:43.218]  Revealed!
[01:47:43.398 --> 01:47:48.681]  Ashcroft tenant Rumsfeld warned 9-11 Commission about line it should not cross.
[01:47:49.061 --> 01:47:59.586]  Senior Bush administration officials sternly cautioned the 9-11 Commission against probing too deeply into terror attacks of September 11, 2001, according to a document recently obtained by the ACLU.
[01:48:00.586 --> 01:48:01.787]  What, I'm just supposed to ignore this?
[01:48:02.307 --> 01:48:12.311]  The notification came in a letter dated January 6, 2004, addressed by Attorney General John Ashcroft, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and CIA Director George J. Tenet.
[01:48:12.931 --> 01:48:14.232]  And it's an order from the White House.
[01:48:14.392 --> 01:48:15.513]  You can read the actual document.
[01:48:15.873 --> 01:48:22.636]  The ACLU described it as a fax sent by David Addington, then counsel, to former Vice President Dick Cheney.
[01:48:22.976 --> 01:48:24.376]  And you can link through and read the document.
[01:48:24.396 --> 01:48:25.697]  In fact, we ought to pull the document up.
[01:48:26.758 --> 01:48:27.478]  That's LinkedIn here.
[01:48:28.992 --> 01:48:44.420]  And it continues, and the message, the officials denied the Bipartisan Commission's request to question terrorist detainees, informing its two senior most members that it would cross a line and obstruct the administration's ability to protect the nation.
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:52.784]  And I remember Cheney, I think it was on Meet the Press or Face the, yeah it was Meet the Press, when Congress was investigating, separately from the Commission,
[01:48:53.877 --> 01:49:00.680]  And Cheney said, look, you better not investigate all this, or you're going to frustrate our protecting you, and we'll be nuked.
[01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:16.788]  And now Obama's saying, you better not criticize, and his surrogate Bill Clinton is saying, you better not criticize our health care, or the banker bailout, or anything else, the carbon taxes, because the hate you're creating is going to make federal buildings get blown up.
[01:49:19.028 --> 01:49:20.229]  I mean, use common sense.
[01:49:20.329 --> 01:49:20.889]  Use your head.
[01:49:21.029 --> 01:49:21.670]  Use your gut.
[01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:23.371]  Use your street smarts, folks.
[01:49:23.851 --> 01:49:32.157]  You've seen all this demonization leading up to this, and now they're saying we're all racist, totally made up, and setting us up, posing as racist at tea parties.
[01:49:33.211 --> 01:49:42.979]  And then Clinton's out saying, gee, I hope we don't need another terror attack in America by domestic groups before this type of rhetoric isn't used anymore about the government being treasonous.
[01:49:43.419 --> 01:49:50.965]  The government is treasonous by every measurement in the universe, by every measurement in the world.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:50:20.479]  If you just tuned in, you gotta tune into the restreams when the show ends here in about 10 minutes at InfoWars.com, because in the first and second hour, I non-stop went over NLE 010, 2010, the nuke detonations in these drills, and it says in this FEMA document that they're ordering newspapers to take down, no court order, they just are mafia and tell you to do it, that it says two no-notice
[01:50:24.432 --> 01:50:28.755]  Near simultaneous improvised nuclear device detonations.
[01:50:30.737 --> 01:50:34.359]  Can you imagine what the banks raping this country could do if they set off a nuke?
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:36.901]  The excuse they'd have to crack down on everybody.
[01:50:37.121 --> 01:50:39.363]  People wouldn't be worried about having their pension funds taken then.
[01:50:39.884 --> 01:50:41.725]  This is how we're going to go into 1984.
[01:50:42.005 --> 01:50:45.868]  This is how we're going to go into hardcore Stalinist, Nazi-type tyranny.
[01:50:46.068 --> 01:50:49.050]  We're inches away, and they're going to blame it on the American people.
[01:50:50.842 --> 01:50:52.724]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke, Foods Direct.
[01:50:52.964 --> 01:50:58.188]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[01:50:58.368 --> 01:50:59.409]  Congratulations!
[01:50:59.709 --> 01:51:05.814]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[01:51:06.154 --> 01:51:10.918]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[01:51:11.198 --> 01:51:12.099]  Now something fun.
[01:51:12.339 --> 01:51:13.080]  It's springtime!
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:20.984]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[01:51:21.205 --> 01:51:21.925]  Here's the plan.
[01:51:22.085 --> 01:51:30.650]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:32.891]  Order now while the free seeds last.

[01:51:39.935 --> 01:51:43.840]  Get a real supply of food to eat while you wait for your supplemental garden to grow.
[01:51:43.981 --> 01:51:45.443]  Call 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[01:51:52.389 --> 01:51:54.691]  And we're subject to other police action.
[01:51:54.871 --> 01:51:55.791]  Tyranny is here.
[01:51:56.152 --> 01:51:59.914]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:52:00.055 --> 01:52:02.276]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:52:02.296 --> 01:52:07.740]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:14.385]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:52:14.825 --> 01:52:20.466]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:52:20.806 --> 01:52:24.547]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:52:24.967 --> 01:52:28.968]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:52:29.268 --> 01:52:34.789]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:38.189]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:52:38.769 --> 01:52:40.190]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:52:40.730 --> 01:52:41.170]  It's here.

[01:53:43.012 --> 01:53:43.192]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:54:04.215 --> 01:54:08.038]  How naive is the general public to trust government?
[01:54:08.698 --> 01:54:17.063]  If you've studied history, the number one cause of death, of unnatural death, natural death would be heart attack, cancer, old age.
[01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:19.885]  It's not drowning.
[01:54:21.727 --> 01:54:25.069]  It's not things like that.
[01:54:26.275 --> 01:54:27.116]  It's governments.
[01:54:27.756 --> 01:54:32.320]  Governments are the number one cause of death worldwide.
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:33.120]  Governments.
[01:54:33.701 --> 01:54:36.283]  Governments killing and enslaving people.
[01:54:38.685 --> 01:54:42.988]  The number two cause of unnatural death is automobiles.
[01:54:43.749 --> 01:54:45.790]  What, do they kill almost 300,000 people a year?
[01:54:47.692 --> 01:54:50.114]  So, I'm actually scared of things that matter.
[01:54:51.007 --> 01:54:54.288]  You know, every time my wife's leaving with the kids in the car, I go, please watch out for other drivers.
[01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:55.689]  Please drive super safe.
[01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:57.230]  And I drive real safe when they're with me.
[01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:58.870]  I don't tend to by myself.
[01:54:59.811 --> 01:55:02.452]  But, uh, you know, I realize what's a real threat.
[01:55:02.512 --> 01:55:03.572]  I'm concerned about government.
[01:55:03.933 --> 01:55:05.093]  I'm concerned about cars.
[01:55:06.334 --> 01:55:07.854]  But see, cops haven't been taught.
[01:55:07.874 --> 01:55:10.675]  They're like the general public to be afraid of what they should really be afraid of.
[01:55:10.695 --> 01:55:11.556]  I've seen the statistics.
[01:55:12.691 --> 01:55:14.692]  I think it's something like eight times you can pull it up.
[01:55:15.132 --> 01:55:21.713]  More likely that a cop will die in a car wreck or being hit while they're writing tickets than they will be by a citizen.
[01:55:21.953 --> 01:55:24.154]  But I see cops when they pull even old ladies over now.
[01:55:24.214 --> 01:55:24.834]  They're shaking.
[01:55:25.134 --> 01:55:26.275]  They got their hand on their gun.
[01:55:26.295 --> 01:55:29.455]  You know, they're scared of the citizens because they tell them every day to be scared of us.
[01:55:29.676 --> 01:55:30.636]  That's mind controlled.
[01:55:31.936 --> 01:55:42.319]  But then I'll see a cop out on 360 or I-35 with their butt literally wagging out with cars about three inches away leaning on a car writing a ticket.
[01:55:43.626 --> 01:56:00.773]  I mean, they got these cops for $200 fines risking their lives on the side of the highway and all it takes is some lady on her cell phone or somebody drops coffee in their lap to swerve out of the lane and boom!
[01:56:01.553 --> 01:56:03.834]  70 miles an hour, that cop is Sloppy Joe's.
[01:56:05.315 --> 01:56:08.536]  And again, I'm just talking about perception here.
[01:56:08.556 --> 01:56:10.997]  I... Here's an example.
[01:56:12.321 --> 01:56:14.043]  My kids will leave the doors open.
[01:56:15.064 --> 01:56:15.464]  Unlocked.
[01:56:15.504 --> 01:56:17.446]  And I explain to them, there are bad men out there.
[01:56:17.526 --> 01:56:18.787]  There are bad people out there.
[01:56:19.708 --> 01:56:22.510]  And it's not that we're living in fear, we're protecting ourselves.
[01:56:22.631 --> 01:56:24.853]  You must lock the doors.
[01:56:25.771 --> 01:56:29.694]  And then I make them where they're the security chiefs and make a game out of it so now they keep the doors locked.
[01:56:30.195 --> 01:56:32.297]  But then they'll go, you know, to their room at night.
[01:56:32.877 --> 01:56:34.138]  Come in and turn the light on.
[01:56:34.198 --> 01:56:34.799]  I'm scared.
[01:56:34.819 --> 01:56:35.619]  Look under the bed.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:37.721]  There's nothing under your bed.
[01:56:37.801 --> 01:56:40.043]  But their instincts are of a little primate.
[01:56:40.924 --> 01:56:42.025]  You're in the woods at night.
[01:56:42.165 --> 01:56:44.327]  That's when big cats might eat you.
[01:56:44.347 --> 01:56:45.228]  So that's an instinct.
[01:56:46.052 --> 01:56:51.095]  Because one of the number one causes of death, you know, thousands of years ago, would be a cat eating you.
[01:56:51.356 --> 01:56:52.436]  Or a bear eating you.
[01:56:52.717 --> 01:56:53.457]  Or a snake.
[01:56:53.837 --> 01:56:55.218]  Why are people scared of snakes?
[01:56:55.238 --> 01:56:56.739]  Why are people have arachnophobia?
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:00.362]  Because there's quite a few species of spiders that'll kill you deader than a hammer.
[01:57:01.603 --> 01:57:02.683]  Those are instincts.
[01:57:03.524 --> 01:57:04.465]  You're scared of the dark?
[01:57:04.845 --> 01:57:06.466]  Because big cats hunt at night.
[01:57:06.946 --> 01:57:09.268]  And our ancestors were preyed on by big cats.
[01:57:09.908 --> 01:57:11.109]  Me, I'm not scared of the dark.
[01:57:11.449 --> 01:57:13.311]  Because I'm in conscious control of my brain.
[01:57:14.301 --> 01:57:25.727]  I know grown men, I'll take out our family ranch and we'll say we're going hog hunting at night with a spotlight battery powered and most grown men in the woods will get scared once you've been walking a few hundred yards out in the woods.
[01:57:27.725 --> 01:57:33.590]  But they get in their car and aren't paying attention flying down the highway with huge 18 wheelers all around them.
[01:57:34.110 --> 01:57:36.553]  I mean, life and death situation.
[01:57:36.953 --> 01:57:38.574]  You'll drive by people dead.
[01:57:38.935 --> 01:57:42.277]  Every year I drive by a fatality injury.
[01:57:42.317 --> 01:57:45.740]  I've seen guts, heads on the ground, blood everywhere right after an accident.
[01:57:46.101 --> 01:57:51.665]  I pulled over and helped people one time when the guy had his head almost completely severed, blood shooting all over the place.
[01:57:52.727 --> 01:57:54.292]  I'm really worried about real things.
[01:57:54.553 --> 01:57:56.058]  Governments and cars.
[01:57:56.078 --> 01:57:57.442]  Let me say it again.
[01:57:58.044 --> 01:57:59.369]  Governments and cars.
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:02.882]  But they got you scared of Bin Laden underneath your bed.
[01:58:03.242 --> 01:58:05.564]  Let me tell you, government and cars.
[01:58:06.565 --> 01:58:09.228]  The number one cause of death is government and cars.
[01:58:10.389 --> 01:58:11.650]  Government and cars.
[01:58:12.631 --> 01:58:14.272]  Our founding fathers knew it was the government.
[01:58:14.392 --> 01:58:15.213]  They didn't have cars.
[01:58:16.294 --> 01:58:17.775]  They also knew not to stand behind a horse.
[01:58:18.276 --> 01:58:19.237]  Horse will kick you to death.
