[00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:08.356]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:11.997]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:24.763]  The entire police state control grid being set up across the world by multinational corporations that control the United Nations, the U.S., England, Europe.
[00:00:26.132 --> 00:00:31.415]  Is being set up for patriots, for libertarians, conservatives, gun owners, returning veterans.
[00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:36.498]  That's in the Homeland Security reports that we got from law enforcement sources and broke last year.
[00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:44.522]  But I want to go over some articles coming up in this news blitz where even the Border Patrol is being used on citizens, not the illegals.
[00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:50.145]  And tie that in with the 800 plus sanctuary cities to illustrate this for people.
[00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:54.240]  And how even the supposed smart fence was never built by Bush.
[00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:58.127]  They built 50-something miles of it on the 2,300 mile border.
[00:00:58.568 --> 00:00:59.609]  And it was all for show.
[00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:04.798]  And ABC News reported illegal aliens were hired by Homeland Security to build the fence.
[00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:14.109]  The Associated Press reported that when they do bust illegals, ICE takes them from Homeland Security and gives them green cards and gives them jobs in the government.
[00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:16.451]  I mean, look, the government wants the illegals here.
[00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:25.117]  And what this illustrates, among a lot of things, is that the government could care less about real security.
[00:01:25.777 --> 00:01:32.842]  And that they only tell us they're setting up this police state to keep us safe from men in caves in Central Asia and the Middle East and from illegals.
[00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.745]  And that it's all selectively enforced and completely rogue and criminal.
[00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:40.767]  So that's coming up amongst other important news today.
[00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:48.012]  Now look, I spontaneously yesterday got really mad at Debra Medina, who we've supported.
[00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:49.934]  I'm tired of being betrayed by politicians.
[00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.076]  I don't think she's an evil or bad person.
[00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:56.812]  But for those that don't know, she's running for governor in Texas.
[00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:58.113]  Why is this important nationwide?
[00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:06.256]  Because her strong showing is getting other people to file to run for governor and statehouse and mayor and county commissioner all over the country.
[00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:08.577]  You got 30, almost 40 states now.
[00:02:08.597 --> 00:02:09.237]  It is 37, 38.
[00:02:10.158 --> 00:02:11.838]  Moving to declare 9th and 10th Amendment.
[00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.041]  Very exciting things happening all over the country to block the unconstitutional activities of the federal government.
[00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:21.703]  So, that's the very good news on that front.
[00:02:22.857 --> 00:02:41.373]  But to have her go on Glenn Beck and say, well I'm not a 9-11 truther, but I think people have a right to speak out, and then she gave a bunch of TV interviews on Houston and Dallas TV, we played clips of that here, where she said that, I think it's, what's the quote, very healthy.
[00:02:42.937 --> 00:02:44.418]  And good that people are questioning.
[00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:47.999]  And that the towers did fall strangely, how the buildings fell.
[00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.420]  And I was like, man, this lady really does stick to her guns, she's great.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.243]  Then, I hear the audio of her on a radio show a few days ago, Mark Davis in Dallas, very big show, a lot of listeners, fills in for Rush Limbaugh.
[00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:06.564]  He says, we're despicable, we're a cult, we're bad, we're evil, we're horrible.
[00:03:06.984 --> 00:03:09.145]  And she says, I agree, absolutely, they're terrible.
[00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.312]  And I get mad about it and say, she better explain herself, and you notice that hasn't happened.
[00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:17.353]  Okay?
[00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:27.578]  Instead, we've gotten hundreds of calls and emails, it's the same thing from listeners, that their people tell them, oh, well, we're, you know, we're going to clarify, and she didn't say exactly that, it's taken out of context.
[00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:28.118]  No, it's not.
[00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:31.519]  And so, it's getting worse by the minute.
[00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:38.482]  Now, this is a national, international show, people listening in Canada, Germany, you know, Russia, Brazil.
[00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:39.723]  And so,
[00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:43.845]  It's wide open phones today.
[00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:44.967]  You can call them about whatever you want.
[00:03:45.648 --> 00:03:48.112]  And I think we've probably had 10 callers or so on Medina.
[00:03:48.593 --> 00:03:49.875]  One of them disagreed with me.
[00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:52.920]  The other people agreed.
[00:03:54.505 --> 00:04:02.911]  And as soon as we put the guy on hold, because they weren't sure I was going back to him, he got real mad, off air, and was saying, shill, shill, shill, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a shill.
[00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:04.011]  Sure.
[00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.634]  I'm an Easter Bunny, too, and a Chinese jet pilot from Pluto.
[00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:10.796]  I'm the king of planet Pop-Tart.
[00:04:11.717 --> 00:04:11.937]  No!
[00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:19.642]  Deborah Medina did what she did, throwing us under the bus, and I'm not going to play politics and roll over to that.
[00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:22.924]  I want to hear, is she going to roll over on every other issue?
[00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:23.945]  That's what we want to hear.
[00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:25.165]  Okay?
[00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:26.706]  We were her biggest support.
[00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:27.786]  That is 9-11 truthers.
[00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:30.186]  I mean, again, the lowest national polls, 36%.
[00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:32.167]  The highest scientific poll, 84%.
[00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:34.507]  Angus and Reed, New York Times.
[00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:37.828]  I mean, we're not despicable people.
[00:04:38.448 --> 00:04:38.848]  Okay?
[00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:40.609]  I was called despicable.
[00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:41.969]  You were called despicable.
[00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:44.870]  I want that clarified.
[00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:49.977]  And if there's a cult following a few people out there that, you know, don't like that, so what?
[00:04:50.517 --> 00:04:51.798]  Go listen to Glenn Beck.
[00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:52.658]  Go listen to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:54.459]  Go support Barack Obama.
[00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:56.739]  We're not trying to win popularity contests.
[00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.621]  If I was doing that, I would have done like a lot of Republican and other talk show hosts and supported Obama early on.
[00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:06.904]  Pat Robertson said he's of God, socialism is good, he is unstoppable.
[00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:08.726]  Pull up Pat Robertson for later.
[00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:13.590]  Pat Robertson says Obama invincible, or Obama's agenda of God.
[00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.111]  Watson wrote an article about it.
[00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:16.612]  I mean, it's a really disgusting video.
[00:05:17.773 --> 00:05:25.840]  I mean, I remember when Pat Robertson, in 2000, and I was on a lot of Christian stations, Christian stations like the show.
[00:05:26.886 --> 00:05:27.847]  Christian News Stations.
[00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:29.167]  And a bunch of them got mad.
[00:05:29.207 --> 00:05:34.671]  He was on CNN and said, we've got to have stronger Planned Parenthood and more abortion in China.
[00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:42.155]  And I said, my God, that's horrible from the supposed pro-life kingpin, except for maybe Dr. Dobson, maybe bigger when it comes to pro-life.
[00:05:42.195 --> 00:05:42.856]  I said, that's horrible.
[00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:43.976]  A bunch of them got mad.
[00:05:44.036 --> 00:05:45.177]  I said, good, get mad.
[00:05:45.197 --> 00:05:47.078]  I mean, he said it.
[00:05:47.378 --> 00:05:48.619]  He's the one that said it.
[00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.220]  He's the one that did it.
[00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:52.722]  Not out of context, on Wolf Blitzer.
[00:05:55.403 --> 00:05:55.764]  Okay?
[00:05:56.806 --> 00:05:59.767]  Glenn Beck's running around saying global warming's real all of a sudden.
[00:06:00.687 --> 00:06:03.288]  So is Sarah Palin, right as it's crashing and burning.
[00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:05.389]  I'm not the one saying that.
[00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:08.810]  I have to call these people out, okay?
[00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.090]  That's what I do.
[00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.252]  I call myself out when I've made mistakes, but this isn't them saying we made a mistake, this is, hey,
[00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:22.573]  I mean, we got a bunch of emails and you heard a call earlier on air going, well, they're saying this is edited video or edited audio.
[00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:23.013]  Yeah.
[00:06:23.473 --> 00:06:25.634]  Well, that, I'd like to see that officially said.
[00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:28.515]  That is outrageous if that is the case.
[00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:33.317]  In fact, we need to just go ahead and make a data page on Medina.
[00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:37.558]  I mean, I mean, here's the, here's the ABC.
[00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:42.120]  Give me a document cam shot on this for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.380]  ABC13.com.
[00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:50.898]  In fact, pull up the actual video page on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:06:51.758 --> 00:06:52.138]  Pull it up.
[00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:59.163]  I mean, I know you guys already captured the video, but have Jaron that found the original clip this morning from their site.
[00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:01.364]  Get that IM over and pull it up on screen.
[00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:02.685]  We'll play this for you.
[00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:06.207]  We won't have time to go to calls and cover news, but I can play the whole 11-minute clip.
[00:07:06.628 --> 00:07:08.249]  We can just play the whole thing for you.
[00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:09.169]  It's unedited.
[00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:13.632]  You know, it's healthy.
[00:07:13.692 --> 00:07:14.253]  It's good.
[00:07:14.273 --> 00:07:15.714]  The towers fell suspiciously.
[00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:18.728]  Week and a half later, we're despicable.
[00:07:18.748 --> 00:07:20.170]  And I'm like, what is this?
[00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.211]  What is this double talk?
[00:07:21.451 --> 00:07:22.833]  Don't you ask questions!
[00:07:23.974 --> 00:07:24.435]  No!
[00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:29.781]  Alright, going back to, who was I talking to last?
[00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:32.565]  Frank in North Carolina.
[00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:33.526]  Frank, finish up your point.
[00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:42.420]  Yeah, you know, a lot of your critics, they criticize us as being these mind-numbed robots, like, you know, Rush Limbaugh listeners or whatnot.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.141]  But yet, when we think for ourselves, you didn't tell me what to think on this.
[00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:49.502]  As soon as I heard that clip, I smelled a red flag.
[00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:51.423]  I mean, something didn't seem right about it.
[00:07:51.463 --> 00:07:53.424]  Well, that's a COINTELPRO talking point.
[00:07:53.444 --> 00:08:02.167]  We've actually seen CENTCOM operators from CENTCOM IP say that, oh, you're just an Alex Jones drone, because they're really worried about what we do here.
[00:08:02.207 --> 00:08:02.487]  Go ahead.
[00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:07.884]  I understand that politicians have to compromise in an environment like we're in right now.
[00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.966]  Speaking the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:10.627]  I understand that.
[00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:12.829]  But she handled that wrongly.
[00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.953]  She certainly could have handled that better.
[00:08:15.973 --> 00:08:17.675]  I don't trust her.
[00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:19.256]  I cannot trust her after that.
[00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:21.419]  I disavow any support I had for her.
[00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.380]  I'm a liberty-loving
[00:08:22.944 --> 00:08:26.987]  American who believes, you know, in the ideals of this country.
[00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:27.688]  I'm a veteran.
[00:08:27.968 --> 00:08:28.848]  I'm a conservative.
[00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:29.529]  Always have been.
[00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:31.530]  I'm a 9-11 trooper and I'm proud of it.
[00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.652]  I voted for Ron Paul in the primary.
[00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:36.054]  He's not my favorite guy in the world, to be honest with you.
[00:08:37.195 --> 00:08:39.957]  I don't agree with you on everything, but you know what?
[00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:41.838]  Something's not right about that.
[00:08:41.978 --> 00:08:44.840]  And also, I just want to say... Frank, Frank, Frank.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.902]  I mean, it's not that we'd even disagree with her.
[00:08:46.982 --> 00:08:47.803]  It's that it's a total 180.
[00:08:49.984 --> 00:08:51.986]  And that's the big concern here.
[00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:56.209]  And what, if she does other 180s, we're not supposed to criticize her or be concerned?
[00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:58.551]  Exactly.
[00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:07.318]  Do you remember the pilot, Chesley B. Sully-Sullenberger, who heroically crashed the plane into the water?
[00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:08.659]  I think it was the Hudson River, wasn't it?
[00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:11.201]  Say it again?
[00:09:12.582 --> 00:09:13.183]  The pilot.
[00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:16.185]  Supposedly heroic pilot, and he may well be.
[00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:17.406]  His name was Sullenberger.
[00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:17.486]  Yes.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.060]  Yeah.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.281]  Well, I wanted to bring this up on your radar.
[00:09:22.301 --> 00:09:25.182]  I know you don't have time to look into it, but maybe someone else can.
[00:09:25.603 --> 00:09:37.047]  He is going around the neocon talk show circuit now, promoting full-body scanners, and he says everything that can be done should be done, and all this, and they're making a big hero out of him.
[00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:41.849]  Apparently, he's quit his pilot career, and he's going around making these speeches and everything.
[00:09:41.989 --> 00:09:47.531]  I don't know if he was necessarily a bad person to begin with, a neocon, but they've gotten a hold of him, and they're using him.
[00:09:47.952 --> 00:09:55.516]  to promote all this stuff, and it's very diabolical to listen to the questions, and he answers just the way they want him to.
[00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:01.979]  Oh yeah, the naked body scanners taking our baby's blood at birth without warrants, secretly.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.501]  Video cams in the computers watching everybody.
[00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:07.242]  This is the issue.
[00:10:07.342 --> 00:10:08.483]  This is the threat.
[00:10:08.863 --> 00:10:10.063]  This is the New World Order.
[00:10:10.123 --> 00:10:11.164]  I appreciate your call.
[00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:13.525]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Texas.
[00:10:13.565 --> 00:10:14.306]  Bob, you're on the air.
[00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:14.726]  Go ahead.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.841]  Mr. Jones, it is a pleasure.
[00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:19.822]  This is Bob with the Funkmaster5 channel on YouTube.
[00:10:20.262 --> 00:10:29.306]  I was able to get through to Glenn Beck's show this morning and confront him about supporting Sarah Palin even though she supported a new investigation in 2008.
[00:10:29.426 --> 00:10:34.028]  I was able to get the question out on his show and it's probably one of my best calls yet.
[00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:35.208]  He acts like a complete idiot.
[00:10:36.108 --> 00:10:37.229]  Is it up on YouTube yet?
[00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.048]  I'm working on the video right now.
[00:10:39.108 --> 00:10:41.030]  I should have it later today, tomorrow.
[00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.231]  That is sensational.
[00:10:42.531 --> 00:10:46.694]  So what did he say when you pointed out that Palin was more of a 9-11 truther than Medina?
[00:10:47.535 --> 00:10:57.063]  Well, he interrupted me, like he usually does, and then he went on to say that he supports people asking more questions, and then he started making some sound effects because I kept talking.
[00:10:57.103 --> 00:10:58.464]  He tried to voice me over.
[00:10:58.484 --> 00:11:04.469]  I was trying to tell people to YouTube search Palin 9-11, but he cut me off there.
[00:11:04.569 --> 00:11:06.571]  I was able to squeeze a little bit out.
[00:11:07.543 --> 00:11:13.386]  Him and his guys just went on for about five more minutes after they hung up on me about it.
[00:11:13.526 --> 00:11:18.868]  So it's a little bit of stuff to work on, but I should be able to have the video up by tomorrow morning at the latest.
[00:11:19.228 --> 00:11:20.789]  Well, we'll play clips of it tomorrow then.
[00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:22.470]  I appreciate your call.
[00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:31.173]  Funkmaster5 has a great YouTube channel, and he calls into big syndicated shows, talks to millions of people, and then points out how ridiculously deceptive they are.
[00:11:31.874 --> 00:11:36.696]  And again, I tried my best when she was sticking to her guns to put that video out.
[00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:48.270]  We first reported a year and a half ago that Sarah Palin had called for more 9-11 truth than Debra Medina had to point out the hypocrisy of it.
[00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:51.891]  Just working tirelessly to the bone, telling my listeners to send her money.
[00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:54.032]  But now I am not allowed to have an opinion.
[00:11:54.052 --> 00:11:57.072]  I am to sit down and shut up because I'm despicable.
[00:11:57.392 --> 00:11:59.173]  I'm a despicable 9-11 truther.
[00:11:59.333 --> 00:11:59.973]  I am trash.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.980]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.

[00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:47.361]  Isn't that what
[00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:50.843]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:12:50.923 --> 00:12:53.925]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:55.866]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:14.517]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:13:15.258 --> 00:13:20.722]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:25.927]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:13:26.087 --> 00:13:36.075]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:38.296]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:13:38.537 --> 00:13:39.877]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:13:40.118 --> 00:13:42.399]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:44.421]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:49.504]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:05.492]  Is garlic the absolute best defense against the threat of bacterial and viral pandemics?
[00:14:05.832 --> 00:14:06.053]  No.
[00:14:06.273 --> 00:14:09.115]  The answer is Ali C. From your Ali store dot com.

[00:14:30.568 --> 00:14:31.650]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:36.214]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:14:36.374 --> 00:14:42.120]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.583]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:14:45.803 --> 00:14:48.426]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:48.526 --> 00:14:53.452]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:15:01.059 --> 00:15:04.320]  Money talks, and it sounds just like Jim Cramer.
[00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:05.381]  I'm Cramer.
[00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:10.463]  Money talks, and sometimes it shouts when the results speak for themselves.
[00:15:10.803 --> 00:15:17.346]  Investors worldwide follow Jim Cramer's advice on TV, in books, and on websites like thestreet.com.
[00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:21.847]  And whether the market's up, down, or sideways, Jim's always hunting down a bull market.

[00:15:56.866 --> 00:15:58.467]  Go to get Kramer dot com.
[00:16:09.557 --> 00:16:16.160]  You know, we get calls every day about that Kramer ad that runs.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.802]  Genesis has its radio ads.
[00:16:19.942 --> 00:16:22.103]  I have a few ads an hour.
[00:16:22.463 --> 00:16:23.724]  You hear my ads.
[00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:36.890]  And I'm going to have to talk to Ted, because I never get involved in what advertising they run.
[00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.352]  I know they have ad agencies that come to them, and what's Ted supposed to do?
[00:16:40.712 --> 00:16:42.453]  They want to run an ad for Kramer's newsletter.
[00:16:42.473 --> 00:16:44.495]  You know, that's Ted's issue.
[00:16:45.555 --> 00:16:47.536]  But no, I don't work with Kramer.
[00:16:48.077 --> 00:16:51.459]  That's the new conspiracy theory going on out there.
[00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.661]  I wouldn't take an ad from Kramer.
[00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:58.403]  I don't think we've been, because I don't think what he does is moral.
[00:16:59.003 --> 00:16:59.604]  I don't like him.
[00:17:00.504 --> 00:17:00.784]  I don't know.
[00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:23.559]  Bongs and adult bookstores and sexual aids.
[00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.219]  I know they turned down Viagra ads.
[00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:26.879]  Everybody else takes them.
[00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:38.002]  I mean, we have a super high standard here at my office, and I think Ted's got a pretty high standard, but I can't... I've already addressed the Kramer thing repeatedly, and I can't just continue to address it.
[00:17:38.422 --> 00:17:41.482]  I'm not putting body scanners in the airports to naked body scan your family.
[00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:45.123]  I'm not sending the IRS after you with liens to take your property.
[00:17:46.044 --> 00:17:48.507]  I'm not secretly taking your baby's blood at birth.
[00:17:48.907 --> 00:17:51.791]  I'm not putting spy cams in the laptops and giving them to your kids.
[00:17:51.851 --> 00:17:52.852]  I'm fighting all of that.
[00:17:53.352 --> 00:17:54.694]  I can be responsible for me.
[00:17:55.055 --> 00:17:56.596]  Not other Genesis talk show hosts, too.
[00:17:56.636 --> 00:17:57.357]  That's another thing they do.
[00:17:57.718 --> 00:18:00.221]  Because he's got mainly libertarian and conservative hosts.
[00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:01.102]  He's got a few liberal hosts.
[00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.043]  You can say, what are you doing with this?
[00:18:03.084 --> 00:18:04.847]  I can barely run my own life, okay?
[00:18:05.942 --> 00:18:13.906]  I can barely sit here, and that's what the whole system's about in this country, is turning it around about anybody that's criticizing the system.
[00:18:14.286 --> 00:18:14.546]  Okay?
[00:18:14.947 --> 00:18:17.328]  Geithner doesn't even pay his taxes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:18.468]  That's the enemy.
[00:18:18.829 --> 00:18:19.729]  That's the problem.
[00:18:20.069 --> 00:18:21.290]  That's what has to be dealt with.
[00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:22.190]  Okay?
[00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:24.592]  And that's what we're focusing on.
[00:18:25.874 --> 00:18:26.955]  It is driving me up the wall.
[00:18:27.056 --> 00:18:28.838]  Just his voice is enough to drive me up the wall.
[00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:36.067]  It's kind of cool in a way, if you look at it from that perspective though, that Ted is using their New World Order money against him.
[00:18:37.209 --> 00:18:41.894]  I also get these emails going, why did Ted Anderson run ads for your fall The Republic on Rush Limbaugh?
[00:18:42.395 --> 00:18:43.596]  What, we're not supposed to?
[00:18:43.616 --> 00:18:48.020]  I mean, if Rush Limbaugh wanted to have me on his show, should I go on his show?
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.482]  I didn't have the money to run those ads.
[00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:52.643]  Ted tried it out, really didn't make his money back.
[00:18:52.743 --> 00:18:54.024]  You don't hear those ads anymore.
[00:18:54.385 --> 00:18:58.788]  He runs them on some smaller networks, and on XM he is getting a good response there, of all places.
[00:18:58.868 --> 00:19:00.750]  I mean, I would go on Nightline.
[00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.151]  I would go on CNN.
[00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.393]  What matters is what I say.
[00:19:05.635 --> 00:19:07.455]  At the end of the day, it's what I say.
[00:19:07.956 --> 00:19:09.316]  That's what I should be judged by.
[00:19:09.576 --> 00:19:11.296]  What I say, what I do.
[00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:12.036]  Okay?
[00:19:12.076 --> 00:19:12.677]  It's that simple.
[00:19:12.717 --> 00:19:17.218]  And I salute Ted for taking the gamble to run those expensive ads.
[00:19:17.518 --> 00:19:20.038]  And didn't really break even.
[00:19:20.098 --> 00:19:24.379]  Came close, so he's not doing them right now, as I'm sure a lot of people noticed.
[00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:27.240]  I wish it would have been successful to Ted.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.201]  His margin of profit was so small, I sold him the DVDs and almost nothing.
[00:19:32.448 --> 00:19:34.450]  Because the advertising was so much and I wanted to get them out.
[00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:58.109]  You know, I make the films, I make the DVDs, Fall of the Republic costs close to $200,000, Obama Deception $100,000, Endgame over $100,000, Terror Storm about $100,000, Truth Rising about $100,000, and then I say, buy the DVDs if you want to support us, and the trolls say, no!
[00:19:58.589 --> 00:20:00.050]  You're not allowed to sell your own films!
[00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.711]  That's bad!
[00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:07.689]  And I'm the only person I know of, I pioneered this, a few people I think have imitated it, saying make copies of my film.
[00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:08.410]  Get it?
[00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.371]  Give it to everybody.
[00:20:10.372 --> 00:20:12.335]  Because my mission is to get the word out.
[00:20:12.435 --> 00:20:19.143]  Obviously, I also want to be comfortable, be able to take care of myself, and be strong enough to defend myself, if God forbid we ever have a lawsuit or anything like that.
[00:20:20.077 --> 00:20:24.361]  Again, but I can't spend all day, because my crew was saying, there's the Kramer thing again!
[00:20:24.521 --> 00:20:25.081]  Oh, we hate it!
[00:20:25.722 --> 00:20:27.623]  And I'm like, I know.
[00:20:28.104 --> 00:20:30.746]  But most other talk shows wouldn't even say anything about it.
[00:20:31.226 --> 00:20:33.908]  I would think criticizing it would be enough to get it off my show.
[00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:37.772]  But I've been so busy, I haven't called Ted in the last month it's been running.
[00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:39.933]  I need to call him.
[00:20:39.953 --> 00:20:41.835]  In fact, I'll just do it live right now here on air.
[00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:43.316]  I'll call Ted right now.
[00:20:46.499 --> 00:20:47.540]  Hopefully I dialed that right.
[00:20:48.877 --> 00:20:52.439]  Sitting here calling Ted, I'm going to ask him about it.
[00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:54.219]  Have a little bit of fun here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.560]  Jaren is laughing in there.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.122]  I dialed it wrong.
[00:20:59.222 --> 00:21:00.722]  I knew I felt like I hit a button wrong.
[00:21:01.443 --> 00:21:02.203]  We're going to break here.
[00:21:02.723 --> 00:21:03.143]  Let me see.
[00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:15.889]  Anyways, the point is, when I come back, I'm going to news blitz and try to get us focused on issue-oriented things instead of chasing our tails, because I've got all these giant stats.
[00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:17.410]  I saw a Washington Times article today.
[00:21:18.956 --> 00:21:21.097]  Hey, Ted, I keep getting a lot of calls about that crank.
[00:21:21.718 --> 00:21:22.498]  Hey, Ted, can you hear me?
[00:21:27.061 --> 00:21:27.841]  You can't hear me, Ted.
[00:21:27.861 --> 00:21:32.084]  Do you guys have this phone line directed into here?
[00:21:32.104 --> 00:21:32.824]  Because Ted can't hear me.
[00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:34.525]  Oh, whatever.
[00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:35.446]  I'll figure it out.
[00:21:36.726 --> 00:21:38.507]  First I couldn't dial the phone, then he couldn't even hear me.
[00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:40.849]  It just goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:42.537 --> 00:21:44.458]  But I thought I printed that article, but I don't see it.
[00:21:44.518 --> 00:21:47.961]  Washington Times did a fair article looking at the collapse of the towers.
[00:21:48.802 --> 00:21:51.384]  But I guess according to certain people in Texas, that's despicable.
[00:21:51.404 --> 00:21:52.264]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.765 --> 00:21:54.346]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.287 --> 00:21:57.969]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:02.554 --> 00:22:06.195]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:06.515 --> 00:22:14.657]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:19.418]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:22:19.998 --> 00:22:30.820]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:40.463]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:40.963 --> 00:22:46.005]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:22:46.405 --> 00:22:53.588]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:53.888 --> 00:22:56.309]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:05.439]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:08.820]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.821]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:20.083]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:23:20.243 --> 00:23:22.484]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:23:23.024 --> 00:23:23.304]  Tim Geithner?
[00:23:23.324 --> 00:23:23.744]  Bernanke?
[00:23:23.824 --> 00:23:24.445]  They're arsonists!
[00:23:24.505 --> 00:23:25.785]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:23:25.805 --> 00:23:28.026]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:23:41.912 --> 00:23:43.753]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:23:43.773 --> 00:23:48.877]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:23:49.197 --> 00:23:58.323]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:00.516 --> 00:24:05.781]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:24:05.821 --> 00:24:08.523]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:24:08.563 --> 00:24:13.027]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:24:13.908 --> 00:24:18.372]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:22.936]  We also have some specials when you get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[00:24:23.396 --> 00:24:24.077]  A new level
[00:24:24.397 --> 00:24:24.818]  We're good.
[00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:45.677]  Shadow government, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:49.080]  Shadow government.

[00:24:51.982 --> 00:24:57.066]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:24:57.807 --> 00:25:07.955]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:25:08.435 --> 00:25:11.158]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:12.426 --> 00:25:14.107]  Okay, here's what's gonna happen.
[00:25:14.927 --> 00:25:18.329]  We're gonna go through a ton of news, then continue with your calls in the next hour.
[00:25:18.949 --> 00:25:22.331]  For the 20-something people on hold, if you want to hang up, you can, or you can call back.
[00:25:22.651 --> 00:25:25.112]  When I open the phones up again in the next hour, at 1-800-259-9231, or 888-201-2244.
[00:25:30.922 --> 00:25:34.926]  I've got this Washington Times article inside the BeltWave.
[00:25:35.907 --> 00:25:39.351]  It says, Jennifer Harper, explosive news.
[00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:50.442]  And 1,000 architects and engineers earlier in the week, Richard Gage leading them, had an international simulcast from different areas of the world all into this big conference.
[00:25:50.822 --> 00:25:52.223]  Australia, England, Germany.
[00:25:52.924 --> 00:26:00.550]  There's German, former German defense ministers, a number two in the Japanese government, all of these people coming out saying it looks like inside job.
[00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:07.895]  And that's why the system keeps attacking 9-11 truth, because the public is learning that we were lied to about 9-11.
[00:26:08.156 --> 00:26:11.078]  And it's coming out the underwear bombing situation with Stage.
[00:26:11.098 --> 00:26:13.179]  I got a big stack, like where's my file?
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:19.264]  Big developments on the Joe Stack kamikaze attack, looking more and more like a Stage deal as well on that front, and that's coming up.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.661]  We're going to cover that in a moment.
[00:26:24.121 --> 00:26:25.242]  I did get a hold of Ted.
[00:26:26.163 --> 00:26:27.444]  He's been out of town.
[00:26:27.484 --> 00:26:28.665]  He's actually back in the office.
[00:26:29.065 --> 00:26:31.107]  So he's going to be in studio with us in just a minute.
[00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:35.210]  He's getting in there right now at the Genesis Studios up in Minneapolis, St.
[00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:35.870]  Paul area.
[00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.772]  I guess they're in Burnsville, to be precise.
[00:26:38.252 --> 00:26:48.400]  But since I said I would play this Pat Robertson clip where he was saying Obama is unstoppable, he is of the Lord, I'm starting to like him now, and all these other things.
[00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:54.152]  All the neocons, everybody was saying he was unstoppable, his agenda will go through.
[00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:55.772]  They wanted it to go through.
[00:26:56.032 --> 00:26:57.413]  The people stood up and said no.
[00:26:58.013 --> 00:27:00.614]  So now he's using executive orders to go around the Congress.
[00:27:01.295 --> 00:27:01.635]  Okay?
[00:27:02.375 --> 00:27:05.596]  But let's go ahead and play this Pat Robertson video slash audio clip.
[00:27:05.616 --> 00:27:07.737]  Here he is, right after Obama got elected.
[00:27:08.658 --> 00:27:13.359]  The Lord said, the economy of your nation will recover.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.082]  The steps taken will lead to a dramatic increase in the power of government.
[00:27:20.296 --> 00:27:25.238]  The people will welcome socialism in order to relieve their pain.
[00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:36.223]  Nothing will stand in the way of a plan by Obama to restructure the economy in the same fashion as the New Deal in the 30s.
[00:27:36.844 --> 00:27:41.786]  America will never again have the power in the world that it has enjoyed since World War II.
[00:27:42.546 --> 00:27:47.509]  With no strong leadership, dangerous dictators will arise in various parts of the world.
[00:27:48.329 --> 00:27:52.613]  And then he goes on to say, Obama's of the Lord, and he's good.
[00:27:53.594 --> 00:27:57.097]  In fact, here are some of the quotes.
[00:27:58.037 --> 00:28:04.403]  Obama's middle-of-the-road cabinet consisted of people hailing from the Council on Foreign Relations, Rhode Island Commission, and the Secret of Bilderberg Group.
[00:28:04.423 --> 00:28:05.524]  Let me find the quote.
[00:28:06.104 --> 00:28:07.886]  I am remarkably pleased with Obama.
[00:28:08.426 --> 00:28:13.230]  I had grave misgivings about him, but so help me, he's come in forcefully, intelligently,
[00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:19.893]  He's picked a middle-of-the-road cabinet, and so far, if he continues down this course, he has the makings of a great president, Pat Robertson.
[00:28:20.233 --> 00:28:24.314]  He's saying socialism will save you, it's a good thing, the economy's going to get better.
[00:28:24.594 --> 00:28:26.495]  Really, nothing's going to stand in the way of Obama?
[00:28:27.515 --> 00:28:29.736]  And that was back when they were all supporting the banker bailout.
[00:28:30.076 --> 00:28:38.519]  Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Pat Robertson, the left, because it was an establishment move.
[00:28:39.474 --> 00:28:42.415]  At the top of the food chain, the establishment supported it.
[00:28:42.815 --> 00:28:45.135]  And now Glenn Beck and others hope you don't remember that.
[00:28:45.795 --> 00:28:46.556]  That's my point.
[00:28:48.076 --> 00:28:49.176]  So it's pretty disgusting.
[00:28:49.296 --> 00:28:54.838]  Alright, I want to get into all this news, but I thought I'd bring Ted Anderson up, because I had never talked to Ted in the last month with his Kramer ad running.
[00:28:55.658 --> 00:28:59.559]  And Ted was telling me off-air, yeah, I kind of wish he'd have dropped, but they just re-upped again.
[00:28:59.579 --> 00:29:04.800]  You know, the issue, and Ted said it eloquently during the break, I said, why don't you come on air and say that?
[00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:15.704]  They didn't refuse the ad for your videos on Michael Savage and George Norrie and Limbaugh.
[00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:24.521]  Why are we going to refuse their ads?
[00:29:24.561 --> 00:29:28.524]  This is a... I mean, that would be, I guess, a form of censorship to them.
[00:29:30.346 --> 00:29:32.167]  But again, anything we do is going to be criticized.
[00:29:32.928 --> 00:29:34.189]  I'm not getting any money from this.
[00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:35.430]  It's a stupid newsletter.
[00:29:36.351 --> 00:29:39.014]  The point is, I mean, I guess we should... I guess censor Kramer?
[00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:41.976]  He's obviously getting a big response.
[00:29:41.996 --> 00:29:46.580]  What does that say for advertising that Kramer's coming to us for advertising?
[00:29:47.161 --> 00:29:48.122]  I mean, I guess Ted...
[00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:52.430]  Who turns down most of the ads that come into him.
[00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.532]  I mean, I guess you just can't do anything right, Ted Canyon.
[00:29:56.293 --> 00:30:00.236]  No, it's always a crapshoot as to how the audience will respond.
[00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:10.884]  But this one is really kind of has me baffled because here you have, I mean, first of all, I did see video footage of him supporting Ron Paul, which has me puzzled.
[00:30:11.317 --> 00:30:21.700]  I know he's on mainstream television, and why does mainstream television need to come to us for our audience to buy newsletters from Kramer?
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:27.582]  I mean, it doesn't make sense to me, but the whole point is that, you know, where do you draw the line?
[00:30:27.622 --> 00:30:30.683]  Where does censorship start, and when does it stop?
[00:30:31.123 --> 00:30:34.004]  How far down that slippery slope do I want to go?
[00:30:35.925 --> 00:30:47.235]  Quite honestly, Alex, when we have, you know, media buyers that are, you know, wanting to support the movement that we're doing, I mean, they used to avoid us like the plague.
[00:30:47.395 --> 00:30:48.115]  I still haven't.
[00:30:48.356 --> 00:30:58.464]  I mean, you should see the email response I have back from KSTP AM 1500 here in Minneapolis, a 50,000 watt clear channel station blowtorch.
[00:30:58.884 --> 00:31:02.828]  I mean, they simply flat out refused to pick up your show.
[00:31:03.588 --> 00:31:07.915]  And, uh, you know, and the reason why they did it is because they don't like your content.
[00:31:08.536 --> 00:31:11.840]  And, you know, I just, I get so sick and tired of the censorship.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.322]  It drives me crazy.
[00:31:13.362 --> 00:31:19.271]  I mean, if I, if I canceled all the shows that I've had requests to cancel on my network,
[00:31:19.591 --> 00:31:22.514]  I wouldn't have even one single show running on this network.
[00:31:22.854 --> 00:31:24.676]  I mean, people want me to stop your show.
[00:31:24.956 --> 00:31:26.457]  They want me to start other shows.
[00:31:26.477 --> 00:31:28.599]  I mean, the whole thing's crazy.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.283]  And, you know, this Kramer thing, they came in, it was a media buyer they bought.
[00:31:32.643 --> 00:31:33.844]  They're getting great results.
[00:31:33.904 --> 00:31:38.048]  That just tells me that the Alex Jones Show is smoking out there.
[00:31:38.468 --> 00:31:45.275]  And by the way, by the way, these ad agencies, they want to get a response for their buyers so they get the ad money again.
[00:31:45.959 --> 00:31:47.661]  That's exactly what that's about.
[00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:54.666]  And so obviously, there's a lot of people calling them up and wanting to see what this newsletter is about.
[00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:58.290]  And it also tells, it's a great, you know,
[00:32:03.582 --> 00:32:06.824]  It just tells you how big your audience has grown.
[00:32:06.844 --> 00:32:07.904]  I mean, you take a look.
[00:32:08.304 --> 00:32:17.710]  If you go to Alexa.com and you type in InfoWars, and then you compare it to what would be the next largest site that you'd think of, or maybe even bigger,
[00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:22.007]  How about RushLimbaugh.com and do a comparison and see who's doing better.
[00:32:22.608 --> 00:32:28.551]  Alex, your audience on the internet is bigger than anything else out there on radio, bar none.
[00:32:29.192 --> 00:32:31.373]  And the world is seeing that now.
[00:32:31.933 --> 00:32:38.437]  And as far as I'm concerned, this is carrying the message into a camp that normally wouldn't take this message.
[00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:42.200]  I mean, it's kind of like, you can take the example of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.365]  He didn't sit there and hang out with all of his followers.
[00:32:45.405 --> 00:32:46.767]  He never talked to the crowd.
[00:32:47.788 --> 00:32:49.611]  He wasn't preaching to the choir.
[00:32:50.012 --> 00:32:51.594]  He went out and found the wicked.
[00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:55.010]  Isn't that what this is about?
[00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:59.732]  Don't we want to carry the Alex Jones Show and make a bigger impression?
[00:32:59.772 --> 00:33:18.623]  I keep on getting accused of trying to support these people, but how are we ever going to be able to mold this nation back to its founding fathers with the roots of the Constitution and what this great nation stands for if we're not going to be welcoming
[00:33:19.557 --> 00:33:22.040]  You know, people to listen to this type of a message.
[00:33:22.241 --> 00:33:24.964]  Well, let's expand on that and then I want to get into news, Ted.
[00:33:25.005 --> 00:33:34.798]  Speaking of a newsletter that I do endorse and think is great, you are offering still, free, Bob Chapman's International Forecaster comes out twice a week and you can get it in hard copy or digital.
[00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:35.579]  Free!
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:42.926]  Well, Bob Chapman's International Forecaster is hands down the best newsletter that you can get your hands on.
[00:34:02.443 --> 00:34:15.454]  I mean, 40, 50, 60 pages, and it's the people that are in the know, the people that have taken the time to educate themselves, are going to be the people that are going to survive what's coming to us.
[00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:26.583]  I mean, I don't know if people really have a good grasp about what's really happening to this country right now and the economic situation that we're in, but you really need to be educated
[00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:31.906]  You know, information is the key to survival in this environment.
[00:34:32.186 --> 00:34:35.027]  There's hands down, that's what you need to have.
[00:34:35.307 --> 00:34:36.647]  That's why I'm making this offer.
[00:34:36.947 --> 00:34:41.769]  I mean, you're going to have a fifth of an ounce of gold that's yours to keep, to use wherever you want to sell it.
[00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:42.369]  I don't care.
[00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.429]  You don't even have to sell it to Midas.
[00:34:44.689 --> 00:34:46.250]  It holds value across the world.
[00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.190]  And there are 249.61.
[00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:55.792]  And then we turn around and we pay for that subscription for Bob's newsletter, The International Forecaster.
[00:34:56.332 --> 00:34:58.934]  And he's going to send it to you for a year for free.
[00:34:58.974 --> 00:35:04.179]  Either you can have it emailed to you, or you can have it sent right through the United States Post Office.
[00:35:04.239 --> 00:35:05.239]  Either way, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:08.582]  And it's 40-something pages or more on average.
[00:35:09.303 --> 00:35:10.224]  Folks, here's the number.
[00:35:10.244 --> 00:35:10.284]  800-686-2237.
[00:35:10.304 --> 00:35:10.364]  800-686-2237.
[00:35:10.384 --> 00:35:10.584]  Again, 800-686-2237.
[00:35:10.624 --> 00:35:14.847]  And briefly, Ted, some of the other great deals you've got on silver and other gold coins.
[00:35:24.275 --> 00:35:25.076]  Yeah, of course.
[00:35:25.136 --> 00:35:28.179]  I mean, we currently right now have the Lakota coin at $20.91.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.443]  We have the Montana coin at $18.73.
[00:35:33.063 --> 00:35:42.132]  A great coin to be getting into if you want to really throw your nose up at the face of the Fed and these currency laws that we have here in the United States.
[00:35:42.532 --> 00:35:44.733]  British Sovereigns right now at $308.76.
[00:35:45.453 --> 00:35:47.073]  All that stuff is at a great buy.
[00:35:47.313 --> 00:35:52.035]  We have some old $20 Liberties and $10 Liberties if you're interested in that kind of thing.
[00:35:52.395 --> 00:35:55.876]  We also have the US Eagle at a real good price.
[00:35:57.456 --> 00:36:01.137]  Call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:36:01.157 --> 00:36:07.479]  When gold was down there at $1,050 an ounce, I was able to accumulate some things and I'm passing on the savings to you.
[00:36:07.859 --> 00:36:15.926]  But that, Frank, hands down, I mean, that's like turning the clock back up into the middle of the 90s, where you could buy gold between $400 and $500 an ounce.
[00:36:16.447 --> 00:36:17.067]  Absolutely!
[00:36:17.087 --> 00:36:17.267]  800-686-2237.
[00:36:17.447 --> 00:36:21.391]  Ted, thanks for the great job you're doing.
[00:36:21.671 --> 00:36:21.931]  You bet.
[00:36:21.951 --> 00:36:22.552]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:36:22.932 --> 00:36:23.292]  You bet.
[00:36:24.473 --> 00:36:28.357]  Okay, let me get into a bunch of news here, and then your phone calls, because there is so much to cover.
[00:36:29.097 --> 00:36:29.998]  Look at this article.
[00:36:30.078 --> 00:36:32.981]  Give me a document cam shot on this, guys, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:36:33.321 --> 00:36:34.782]  The Washington Times.
[00:36:36.158 --> 00:36:37.399]  February 22nd.
[00:36:37.459 --> 00:36:39.059]  So this came out two days ago.
[00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:42.061]  I saw it this morning and I couldn't believe it.
[00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:45.943]  This is the Neocon Washington Times.
[00:36:47.303 --> 00:36:49.224]  But they do throw some curveballs occasionally.
[00:36:49.264 --> 00:36:51.385]  This is the popular Inside the Beltway column.
[00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:54.126]  Explosive News is the headline.
[00:36:54.486 --> 00:36:56.808]  We have this linked up on our websites if you want to find it.
[00:36:58.528 --> 00:37:04.131]  And it is a positive, fair article about the towers being blown up.
[00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.012]  I mean, I cannot believe this.
[00:37:08.433 --> 00:37:11.416]  And that's why you see the attack on 9-11 Truth everywhere.
[00:37:11.836 --> 00:37:13.818]  Because it's so mainstream.
[00:37:13.878 --> 00:37:16.440]  The polls, on average, are over 50%.
[00:37:17.421 --> 00:37:18.983]  Some are even higher.
[00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:21.826]  You can't ignore these numbers.
[00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.087]  People are finding out.
[00:37:23.447 --> 00:37:25.069]  People are looking at the collapse of Building 7.
[00:37:25.249 --> 00:37:27.491]  And that's what this article talks about.
[00:37:30.162 --> 00:37:35.608]  The mainstream media can ignore this only so long, and then they are not even relevant if they don't start focusing on it.
[00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:37.971]  And their debunking exercises haven't worked.
[00:37:39.252 --> 00:37:44.658]  A lingering technical question about September 11th terror attack still haunts some, and it has political implications.
[00:37:44.718 --> 00:37:50.365]  How did 200,000 tons of steel disintegrate and drop in 11 seconds?
[00:37:51.826 --> 00:37:53.889]  A thousand architects and engineers want to know.
[00:37:53.909 --> 00:37:54.770]  Talk about solutions.
[00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.112]  They're doing such a great job.
[00:37:56.552 --> 00:37:57.814]  Architects and engineers found love and truth.
[00:37:58.215 --> 00:38:07.848]  And are calling on Congress to order a new investigation into the destruction of the Twin Tower Building 7 at the World Trade Center.
[00:38:08.168 --> 00:38:09.390]  I mean, that is incredible!
[00:38:10.993 --> 00:38:21.662]  In order to bring down this kind of mass in such a short period of time, the material must have been artificially exploded outwards, says Richard Gage, a San Francisco architect and founder of the non-profit Architects Engineering Shrine of Love and Truth.
[00:38:22.422 --> 00:38:33.672]  Mr. Gage, who is a member of the American Institute of Architects, managed to persuade more than 1,000 of his peers to sign a new petition requesting a formal inquiry.
[00:38:34.485 --> 00:38:45.112]  The official Federal Emergency Management Agency and National Institute of Standards and Technology report provide insufficient, contradictory, and fraudulent accounts of the circumstances of the tower's destruction.
[00:38:45.613 --> 00:38:49.335]  We are therefore calling for a grand jury investigation of NIST officials.
[00:38:49.636 --> 00:38:51.857]  Mr. Gage adds, this is powerful!
[00:38:52.277 --> 00:38:58.382]  They're actually reporting, like journalists, a serious issue and what serious people are saying!
[00:38:59.623 --> 00:39:01.364]  And it continues and gets even better!
[00:39:03.325 --> 00:39:07.329]  The technical issues surrounding the collapse of the towers has prompted years of debate, rebuttal, and ridicule.
[00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:15.798]  He is particularly disturbed by Building 7, a 47-story skyscraper, which was not hit by an aircraft, yet came down in pure free-fall acceleration.
[00:39:16.419 --> 00:39:20.903]  He also says more than 100 first responders reported explosives and flashes.
[00:39:21.963 --> 00:39:34.001]  As the town explosions and flashes of the towers were falling and cited evidence of a multi-ton steel sections ejected literally 600 feet at 60 miles an hour and the midair pulverization of 900,000
[00:39:38.035 --> 00:39:40.737]  Or is it 90,000 tons of concrete and metal decking?
[00:39:41.397 --> 00:39:49.682]  There is also evidence of advanced explosive nanothermitic composite material found in the World Trade Center dust, Mr. Gage says.
[00:39:50.022 --> 00:39:55.246]  The group's petition at AE911Truth.org is already on its way to members of Congress.
[00:39:55.566 --> 00:39:57.927]  Government officials will be notified that the
[00:39:59.108 --> 00:40:00.289]  Misprision of treason.
[00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.809]  U.S.
[00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:09.215]  Code 18 Section 2382 is a serious federal offense which requires those with evidence of treason to act, Mr. Gage says.
[00:40:09.655 --> 00:40:14.558]  Implications are enormous and may have profound impact on the forthcoming Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial.
[00:40:15.159 --> 00:40:17.360]  Stay tuned for more in this space.
[00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:20.142]  And they cover some other issues.
[00:40:20.883 --> 00:40:21.403]  Other stories.
[00:40:22.444 --> 00:40:23.264]  I mean, come on!
[00:40:23.965 --> 00:40:24.225]  That
[00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:28.351]  I commend Jennifer Harper.
[00:40:28.371 --> 00:40:29.553]  I wonder what's going to happen to her now.
[00:40:30.373 --> 00:40:32.035]  I mean, this is powerful stuff here.
[00:40:33.056 --> 00:40:33.937]  This is exciting.
[00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:35.519]  This is positive.
[00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:44.128]  And people ridiculed Gage and others when he had 20 members, then 100, then 500, then peer-reviewed journals, now 1,000, and growing, and they're not going to stop.
[00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:47.781]  And we've already won in the court of public opinion.
[00:40:48.181 --> 00:40:51.465]  That's why they're saying we're despicable, evil, horrible, un-American people.
[00:40:51.745 --> 00:40:54.788]  Look, Bill Clinton, his handlers carried out Oklahoma City.
[00:40:54.808 --> 00:40:55.509]  That's been proven.
[00:40:55.769 --> 00:40:57.191]  Covered all my film Road to Tyranny.
[00:40:58.399 --> 00:41:02.762]  Michael Savage comes out and says he's sure Obama's going to stage terror attacks, a Reichstag event.
[00:41:02.822 --> 00:41:03.423]  Is he bad?
[00:41:03.963 --> 00:41:05.804]  This is something governments do!
[00:41:06.345 --> 00:41:08.286]  Now, do we know in every case this is what they've done?
[00:41:08.306 --> 00:41:08.687]  No!
[00:41:09.387 --> 00:41:18.574]  But if they've done it over and over again, and it's declassified that they've admitted they've engaged in many staged terror attacks over the years, we must cover it!
[00:41:20.115 --> 00:41:26.240]  Oh, and it was unpopular day one, before 9-11, and on day one when I came out and said it was an inside job with the evidence, sure!
[00:41:27.352 --> 00:41:30.673]  But I'm not here to win in a popularity contest, and today it's very popular.
[00:41:31.473 --> 00:41:36.954]  I'm here to tell the truth, let the chips fall where they may, take the risk, because liberty is worth it.
[00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:40.174]  My children's future, your children's future, is worth it.
[00:41:40.655 --> 00:41:43.375]  And that's why we're trailblazing and doing what we're doing.
[00:41:43.655 --> 00:41:45.295]  And that's why we've had so much success.
[00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:52.197]  And that's why those that want to prop up the system, and those that are just jealous of somebody who's number one, are coming after us.
[00:41:52.237 --> 00:41:52.757]  And I love it.
[00:41:53.277 --> 00:42:07.188]  Because they, you know, no weapon formed against us shall prosper, Christ said, and everything they do against us backfires and only sends us more listeners and gives us a higher level of visibility.
[00:42:08.008 --> 00:42:15.414]  So that people can come and actually see my films, hear the radio show, watch the TV show, find out what we really stand for.
[00:42:16.624 --> 00:42:17.965]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:42:18.105 --> 00:42:22.007]  And again, I'll say to you out there, don't think you've got to save the world by yourself or overnight.
[00:42:22.387 --> 00:42:23.208]  Wake somebody up.
[00:42:23.288 --> 00:42:23.808]  Show them a film.
[00:42:23.848 --> 00:42:24.969]  Tell them about this radio show.
[00:42:25.229 --> 00:42:27.310]  Go speak out against water fluoridation or city council.
[00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:33.334]  Go speak out against the amnesty program and how 800 plus cities let illegal aliens be above the law.
[00:42:33.714 --> 00:42:34.735]  Talk about the injustice.
[00:42:34.755 --> 00:42:36.316]  Talk about Geithner not paying his taxes.
[00:42:36.816 --> 00:42:39.337]  You expose this fraud one person at a time.
[00:42:39.838 --> 00:42:41.959]  There's no way it's going to stand.
[00:42:42.579 --> 00:42:43.120]  No way!
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:56.930]  So just continue, and don't end fight, and don't get distracted, and don't get diverted, and just continue to hammer away, because you've got the truth, you know you've got a pure heart, and so it's up to you, because you do, to be that leader you are.
[00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.612]  And that's what we're here doing, is waking people up to be leaders.
[00:43:03.755 --> 00:43:09.379]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[00:43:10.043 --> 00:43:11.884]  The world is changing fast.
[00:43:12.244 --> 00:43:13.725]  Are you fully prepared?
[00:43:14.505 --> 00:43:17.167]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[00:43:17.687 --> 00:43:27.973]  At patriotfood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[00:43:28.433 --> 00:43:31.975]  And at survivalistseeds.com, we now offer
[00:43:33.116 --> 00:43:39.081]  50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[00:43:39.762 --> 00:43:44.025]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[00:43:44.626 --> 00:43:48.950]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.592]  Food insurance, just in case.
[00:43:52.173 --> 00:43:56.817]  Owned by me, Big John Lipston, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:44:02.455 --> 00:44:06.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:06.481 --> 00:44:09.485]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:09.725 --> 00:44:14.491]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:18.317]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[00:44:33.877 --> 00:44:36.178]  And on its ashes, constructing world government.
[00:44:36.259 --> 00:44:38.380]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:39.961]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:42.502]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:42.663 --> 00:44:44.504]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:44.804 --> 00:44:49.647]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:49.947 --> 00:44:54.730]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:59.053]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.409]  Hello.
[00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:06.155]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:11.001]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:45:11.322 --> 00:45:16.108]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:45:16.448 --> 00:45:20.371]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:45:20.531 --> 00:45:24.474]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:45:24.574 --> 00:45:27.115]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:28.296]  It was empowering.
[00:45:28.416 --> 00:45:32.319]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:45:32.399 --> 00:45:35.201]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:37.963]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:45:37.983 --> 00:45:38.823]  Thank you so much.
[00:45:39.083 --> 00:45:41.825]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:45:41.925 --> 00:45:42.486]  Thanks again.
[00:45:42.666 --> 00:45:45.288]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:45:46.027 --> 00:45:49.030]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[00:46:15.066 --> 00:46:15.912]  Monday through Friday.
[00:46:17.142 --> 00:46:17.762]  From 11 a.m.
[00:46:17.902 --> 00:46:18.603]  to 3 p.m.
[00:46:18.643 --> 00:46:20.604]  Central Standard Time, we are here live.
[00:46:20.624 --> 00:46:23.786]  We talked to the iPhone app developer.
[00:46:24.146 --> 00:46:32.811]  We've had right up, it's almost about to be 20,000 free downloads of the iTunes free app.
[00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:40.755]  It's free, and we're adding, I think they're already there, it's now linked to a web page that can launch up on your cell phone.
[00:46:41.075 --> 00:46:44.037]  Not just the live stream, but the rebroadcast stream,
[00:46:46.667 --> 00:46:47.788]  Podcast is there.
[00:46:48.128 --> 00:46:51.409]  There's big banners on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:53.791]  We launched this app, what, two weeks ago?
[00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.192]  Two and a half weeks ago, and it's got right at...
[00:46:57.673 --> 00:47:06.335]  20,000 subscribers now who went and downloaded the free app and it's in the top 10 news free apps of the iTunes Store.
[00:47:06.835 --> 00:47:08.216]  And so please send your friend and family.
[00:47:08.236 --> 00:47:16.738]  I mean, you may not have an iPhone, you may not have an Apple, but to the Apple heads, you know, as Apple head chihuahuas, I like apples.
[00:47:17.298 --> 00:47:17.918]  I like PCs.
[00:47:17.958 --> 00:47:18.598]  I like computers.
[00:47:18.638 --> 00:47:21.759]  The point is, just ridiculous puns here.
[00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:23.159]  Not even a pun.
[00:47:23.199 --> 00:47:24.080]  It's nonsensical.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:24.660]  The point is,
[00:47:26.693 --> 00:47:31.616]  It's free, continue to send that link to your friends, family, and neighbors, and turn them on to the truth.
[00:47:31.676 --> 00:47:33.296]  Turn them on to the radio show.
[00:47:33.316 --> 00:47:36.658]  I want to thank everybody that has been doing that out there.
[00:47:37.519 --> 00:47:47.884]  Okay, getting into some of the other news, and I'm going to continue breaking this down into the next hour, and then we're going to go to your calls here in about 15 minutes, for everybody that's patiently holding.
[00:47:51.206 --> 00:47:53.067]  Total lawlessness from the government.
[00:47:53.834 --> 00:47:58.358]  There's complete and total lawlessness, and what do you do when you have a lawless government?
[00:47:59.018 --> 00:48:06.424]  Obama can't get his greenhouse gas taxes passed, and so he just comes out and says, hmm, we'll use the EPA to do that.
[00:48:06.464 --> 00:48:16.613]  Now, he's always said he was going to do this, but the states are getting ready to sue, attorney generals are suing, companies are already suing, but Time Magazine says it's a great thing and that's what he should do.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.541]  Give me your take on that.
[00:48:19.502 --> 00:48:21.904]  Also, an interesting story here out of Business Insider.
[00:48:22.004 --> 00:48:27.649]  America just declared the recovery over, so you better get ready for the double dip.
[00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:42.862]  And this story continues here, saying today's bleak consumer confidence, also housing prices are down, new home starts are down, today's bleak consumer confidence number is undoubtedly bad news for the economy.
[00:48:43.803 --> 00:48:51.606]  The bigger-than-expected drop suggests that consumers have lost confidence in the recovery, which will drive down home prices and consumer spending.
[00:48:52.126 --> 00:48:55.928]  Consumer confidence is typically our first look at the state of the economy.
[00:48:56.268 --> 00:49:05.672]  While most government aggregated data comes out of the two-month lag or more, consumer confidence has been hit with just a one-month lag.
[00:49:05.712 --> 00:49:10.674]  Studies have shown that consumer confidence is a good predictor of consumer spending numbers.
[00:49:11.354 --> 00:49:24.687]  Basically, people surveyed seemed to be good at accurately regarding their own economic situation, and those surveyed reflected the broader economy accurately.
[00:49:25.167 --> 00:49:34.496]  When consumer confidence drops to such deep, unexpected levels, today we're the worst in 27 years, then it is a red flashing light about the economy.
[00:49:35.447 --> 00:49:37.108]  And then it goes through all those numbers.
[00:49:37.588 --> 00:49:40.949]  And the government more and more is saying, oh, we may need another stimulus now.
[00:49:40.969 --> 00:49:45.290]  Remember a year and a half, three months ago, with the banker bailout?
[00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:46.891]  Or I guess more.
[00:49:46.951 --> 00:49:49.892]  That was in October, October, November, December.
[00:49:50.872 --> 00:49:52.493]  And then 12, and then two more months.
[00:49:52.513 --> 00:49:54.154]  That's 15, 16 months ago.
[00:49:54.874 --> 00:49:57.755]  That, oh no, this is the only stimulus we need.
[00:49:57.795 --> 00:49:58.735]  It wasn't a stimulus.
[00:49:59.676 --> 00:50:00.736]  It wasn't a banker bailout.
[00:50:00.756 --> 00:50:02.176]  It was just a mass robbery.
[00:50:02.917 --> 00:50:03.277]  And now,
[00:50:04.585 --> 00:50:13.608]  We had all these economists on the last year and a half saying that by 2010 they would want another stimulus or another looting.
[00:50:13.968 --> 00:50:16.769]  And we have all these top bankers on the news saying austerity.
[00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:18.630]  You'll never get your way of life back.
[00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:24.812]  Most of your taxes have to be raised so you can pay the banks more money on interest that's just all made up.
[00:50:27.645 --> 00:50:38.832]  It's as if Thomas Jefferson's predictions are coming true, that if we ever let private central banks take over the issuance of currency and credit, our children would wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:39.993]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:40.013 --> 00:50:46.017]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:46.057 --> 00:50:48.098]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:51.308 --> 00:50:53.910]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:59.273]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:50:59.654 --> 00:51:01.395]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:51:01.695 --> 00:51:06.518]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:51:06.698 --> 00:51:07.659]  How much do you want?
[00:51:07.879 --> 00:51:08.639]  When do you want it?
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.601]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:11.721]  When will you need it?
[00:51:11.962 --> 00:51:14.023]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:51:14.163 --> 00:51:15.284]  Will there be any food?
[00:51:15.504 --> 00:51:16.825]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:51:17.125 --> 00:51:19.406]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:51:19.566 --> 00:51:22.107]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:25.509]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:51:25.869 --> 00:51:29.371]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:51:29.691 --> 00:51:30.671]  How much will you need?
[00:51:30.851 --> 00:51:31.452]  We don't know.
[00:51:31.752 --> 00:51:32.672]  How much do you want?
[00:51:32.852 --> 00:51:33.592]  All you can get.
[00:51:33.612 --> 00:51:34.593]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:34.873 --> 00:51:37.654]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:51:37.934 --> 00:51:40.554]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:40.774 --> 00:51:41.574]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:41.594 --> 00:51:42.835]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:42.855 --> 00:51:44.875]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:14.324 --> 00:52:15.925]  Okay, we are back live.
[00:52:16.225 --> 00:52:21.589]  I'm going to go ahead and just go to your calls now, and then at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to have news blitz for the rest of the broadcast.
[00:52:21.909 --> 00:52:26.492]  Coming up, DHS may scrap Border Patrol project.
[00:52:27.313 --> 00:52:29.454]  They never really built anything to begin with.
[00:52:30.235 --> 00:52:31.796]  Then I have an LA Times article.
[00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:33.076]  This is out of Information Week.
[00:52:33.637 --> 00:52:38.240]  I have an LA Times article, What American Border Agents Search and Seize.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.222]  And it's citizens they're harassing.
[00:52:43.646 --> 00:52:46.928]  They were using Border Patrol up in Pittsburgh for the G20.
[00:52:48.209 --> 00:52:50.391]  They're doing anything but stopping illegal aliens.
[00:52:51.091 --> 00:52:59.177]  Which again illustrates how they build up these grids to fight Al Qaeda or illegal aliens and it's always for the American people.
[00:52:59.497 --> 00:53:00.478]  I'm going to break that down.
[00:53:01.818 --> 00:53:10.805]  Also over in England, it came out six years ago that Tony Blair was secretly legalizing all the illegals and had a deal with the EU to bring in unlimited numbers.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:21.310]  Mainly so they have a domestic client group that can be politically active for the globalists and that will take welfare to further bankrupt the country to the bankers.
[00:53:21.871 --> 00:53:28.779]  Secret labor plan to increase immigration for social reasons dismisses public opposition as racist.
[00:53:28.799 --> 00:53:30.561]  You don't want to pay for all the taxes for these people?
[00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:36.593]  Because they bring the foreigners in and just cram a welfare bottle in their mouth.
[00:53:37.574 --> 00:53:38.354]  That's coming up.
[00:53:39.135 --> 00:53:41.176]  Meanwhile, they're throwing the book at the American people.
[00:53:41.276 --> 00:53:48.681]  Queens girl, Alexa Gonzalez, hauled out of school in handcuffs after caught drawing on desks saying, I love my friends.
[00:53:49.281 --> 00:53:50.582]  I love my friends Abby and Faith.
[00:53:52.603 --> 00:53:53.224]  Lex was here.
[00:53:55.421 --> 00:53:58.042]  I mean, I see articles where they're arresting people for no seatbelts now.
[00:53:58.422 --> 00:54:03.203]  Just throwing the book at citizens, but illegals are above the law and Geithners above the law.
[00:54:03.483 --> 00:54:05.164]  The highest levels of government, they're above the law.
[00:54:05.404 --> 00:54:06.764]  At the lowest levels, they're above the law.
[00:54:07.324 --> 00:54:12.026]  Only the milk cow Americans are being crushed and squeezed.
[00:54:12.866 --> 00:54:15.287]  Let's go to the phone system here at our studio.
[00:54:16.867 --> 00:54:18.988]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jonathan in Washington.
[00:54:19.028 --> 00:54:19.888]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[00:54:20.441 --> 00:54:21.321]  Hey, how's it going, Al?
[00:54:21.741 --> 00:54:22.022]  Good.
[00:54:22.562 --> 00:54:23.122]  Good.
[00:54:23.342 --> 00:54:37.507]  I was calling, me and my girlfriend are making the movement here in Spokane, Washington, and Gonzaga Private School up here, and we were wondering if you, we don't know if you do this, but if you could come down and give a talk.
[00:54:38.331 --> 00:54:42.375]  We're going door-to-door to tell people about you and trying to get the word out.
[00:54:42.395 --> 00:54:48.059]  I also have a website called FindingTruth509.com that should be up and running by Friday.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.481]  Let me say this.
[00:54:49.701 --> 00:54:55.926]  I would love to... I've been invited to speak in the Fed rallies with Ron Paul.
[00:54:55.946 --> 00:55:00.310]  I've been invited to speak in England, everywhere.
[00:55:01.611 --> 00:55:04.654]  I've been invited to go on national television, different places, but they want me to fly.
[00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:19.720]  I'm so busy doing radio, TV, films, and building my TV studio, and trying to spend some time with my family, that if I choose to go with the model of traveling around, I couldn't do what I'm doing here.
[00:55:19.841 --> 00:55:25.525]  And digitally, and through media, I can reach hundreds of times the people.
[00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:27.947]  I mean, I've already done several radio interviews today.
[00:55:28.488 --> 00:55:29.509]  I'm doing more tomorrow.
[00:55:32.446 --> 00:55:35.187]  Or I can fly somewhere and talk to 500 people, 1,000, even 20,000.
[00:55:35.347 --> 00:55:38.528]  It just doesn't work.
[00:55:39.809 --> 00:55:44.271]  I've only come out recently to demonstration to try to defend the Second Amendment.
[00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:46.832]  And I went to the gun show to try to support it.
[00:55:49.247 --> 00:55:50.268]  Oh, definitely.
[00:55:50.489 --> 00:55:55.074]  And I was also wondering if you had any advice on how to make it, you know, how to get out to people in a bigger, I guess, audience.
[00:56:08.712 --> 00:56:14.858]  Because I mean, I have a website that I'm getting at, but, you know, that doesn't even reach, you know, enough people, I don't think, so.
[00:56:15.079 --> 00:56:15.519]  Oh yeah!
[00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:26.570]  If you launch a website, and then say, hand out a thousand flyers in the town, like, key info, and then the name of your website, and put it on telephone poles and things, you'll get a massive response.
[00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:28.272]  And then if you update it, it'll take time.
[00:56:28.292 --> 00:56:30.534]  A lot of people expect instant results.
[00:56:30.615 --> 00:56:31.455]  No, it takes time.
[00:56:32.225 --> 00:56:34.047]  Okay, put one foot in front of the other.
[00:56:34.888 --> 00:56:48.520]  You can start an organization, go on the local meetup groups, start organizing, and pick local goals, but also educate people about the international and national scope as well.
[00:56:48.561 --> 00:56:49.842]  But great question, Jonathan.
[00:56:50.282 --> 00:56:52.544]  Dylan, Ron, John, Wade, Neil.
[00:56:53.365 --> 00:56:56.607]  Harold, Tyler, Jerry, and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[00:56:56.667 --> 00:56:57.507]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:57.527 --> 00:56:58.047]  You found it.
[00:56:58.067 --> 00:56:59.868]  The front lines of the info war.
[00:56:59.888 --> 00:57:00.549]  The tip of the spear.
[00:57:00.969 --> 00:57:01.949]  What's your home worth?
[00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.071]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:57:04.231 --> 00:57:06.972]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:57:07.272 --> 00:57:14.796]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:58:00.421 --> 00:58:07.285]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:58:07.385 --> 00:58:08.646]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:58:08.666 --> 00:58:09.367]  It's very real.
[00:58:09.487 --> 00:58:11.628]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:58:11.728 --> 00:58:13.269]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:59:01.136 --> 00:59:06.220]  George Washington said, government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force, like fire.
[00:59:06.735 --> 00:59:07.275]  We're good to go.
[00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:27.670]  We're good to go.
[00:59:57.150 --> 01:00:01.173]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:01.193 --> 01:00:02.994]  It is Wednesday, the 24th day of February 2010.
[01:00:03.054 --> 01:00:05.156]  Big News Blitz coming up.
[01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:23.750]  Hi Alex.
[01:00:52.989 --> 01:00:56.331]  First off, I enjoyed yesterday's piece on the drug war.
[01:00:56.712 --> 01:00:57.592]  Very interesting.
[01:00:58.293 --> 01:01:03.096]  But what I wanted to speak with you today was something you mentioned earlier on the show.
[01:01:03.116 --> 01:01:12.101]  Talking about them killing 80% or 90% of the population is what I believe.
[01:01:12.742 --> 01:01:15.323]  Basically the New World Orders agenda.
[01:01:15.503 --> 01:01:19.626]  Now I saw a video of you on YouTube where you were walking around in Georgia
[01:01:20.296 --> 01:01:23.777]  Building the coffins that FEMA purchased for its American citizens.
[01:01:24.118 --> 01:01:31.020]  With that said, I can personally acknowledge that they do have a very large controlled grid in Georgia.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:44.766]  I used to work for a very large corporation and they're literally the phones, computers, air conditioning, everything, lights, everything was controlled by a grid in Georgia.
[01:01:46.949 --> 01:01:57.517]  Basically my main question is, with all of this and what FEMA is doing, what will we be able to tell when martial law will be instated?
[01:01:57.877 --> 01:02:01.981]  Alright Dylan, let me clarify and answer your question.
[01:02:02.361 --> 01:02:05.383]  Number one, I never went to Georgia and walked around in the coffins.
[01:02:05.423 --> 01:02:08.346]  That's somebody else with a southern sounding accent.
[01:02:09.383 --> 01:02:27.090]  I guess they sound a little bit like me, but yes, those are coffin liners and we did confirm last year with the Bureau of Cemeteries from New York and other states that they are preparing for mass death during a bio-attack or a natural plague of some type.
[01:02:28.091 --> 01:02:36.934]  And clearly one big rail of tyranny and bringing in possible martial law or full-born martial law would be a staged bio-attack.
[01:02:37.935 --> 01:02:38.635]  Now that said,
[01:02:41.448 --> 01:03:01.376]  When you are put through naked body scanners, when they're having TSA checkpoints in Miami and Dallas, Texas and New York and Boston, Massachusetts, randomly searching people, or you go downtown Austin and they randomly wan people now, or you try to go to a fireworks display and they're searching you and your bags, or having regular army out, or marines.
[01:03:02.515 --> 01:03:03.757]  This is martial law.
[01:03:03.877 --> 01:03:09.644]  Or when the governor last year in Tennessee says you can't have military checkpoints in all these towns, the military just went ahead and did it.
[01:03:09.705 --> 01:03:10.626]  That is martial law.
[01:03:11.146 --> 01:03:12.368]  It's just not declared.
[01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:18.176]  They are training us that a martial law type atmosphere is normal and acceptable.
[01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:20.235]  How are you doing Alex?
[01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:20.535]  Pretty good.
[01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:48.651]  It's been great to talk to you.
[01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:56.695]  I haven't been able to talk to you since Friday before the gun show, but I mentioned to you about a change in tactic relating to this Mr. Stack's bombing thing.
[01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:13.882]  Yesterday, with the article that you had with Mr. Du about his interrelations with those L3s, in his letter that he wrote, I'm not going to call it a manifesto because Karl Marx wrote a manifesto.
[01:04:13.902 --> 01:04:14.662]  That's a manifesto.
[01:04:14.762 --> 01:04:17.063]  I understand, but in his letter, go ahead.
[01:04:17.711 --> 01:04:32.314]  Yeah, in his letter, he makes a reference to when he was working in Southern California, and at that time frame that he's mentioning in it, L3 was doing a lot of work in involving with the Global Hawk and everything else.
[01:04:35.115 --> 01:04:35.955]  I look at it like this.
[01:04:37.595 --> 01:04:40.296]  You ever want to know where we see the state of the country going?
[01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:44.257]  I see it heading slowly as a probing tactic.
[01:04:45.054 --> 01:04:47.616]  Well, you get one of the most secretive
[01:05:12.261 --> 01:05:18.902]  One of the most secretive companies involved in all sorts of remote control aircraft activity.
[01:05:19.503 --> 01:05:26.744]  And you've got one of their top Homeland Security people that's tied in with L3, owning the hangar his plane was in.
[01:05:26.764 --> 01:05:29.565]  And by the way, I'm going to get to that towards the end of the show.
[01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:34.406]  We now have the statesman reporting he got to the hangar two hours before.
[01:05:34.526 --> 01:05:36.466]  So how did he set the fire at his house?
[01:05:36.526 --> 01:05:39.507]  I guess he could have time-delayed it, but they say the house was on fire about 8.45.
[01:05:41.247 --> 01:05:45.168]  Two hours before that, he's already at the hangar, 25 miles away.
[01:05:45.949 --> 01:05:49.490]  So, the whole thing, it's more and more suspicious.
[01:05:49.530 --> 01:06:01.994]  You have all these witnesses saying they saw no one in the cockpit, they could see into it, that the emergency workers from all over Travis County and the city of Austin were there across the street for a drill, that the FBI was on the ground.
[01:06:02.814 --> 01:06:14.278]  Before, and other reports, seconds after the plane hit and the explosion was heard, you add the fact that they did send Geithner down here to grandstand and try to look like a victim for himself and the IRS.
[01:06:15.279 --> 01:06:18.600]  The fact that it did happen in Austin, you add all this together, it's getting very suspicious.
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:25.883]  And I'll go over that towards the end of the show, because the file on Joe Stack is getting thicker, just on the whole L3 situation we're investigating.
[01:06:27.163 --> 01:06:28.904]  Let's go back to the Genesis phone lines.
[01:06:29.304 --> 01:06:30.925]  Wade in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:06:32.142 --> 01:06:32.722]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:06:33.063 --> 01:06:33.303]  Good.
[01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:36.706]  You know, thanks for everything that you're doing.
[01:06:36.786 --> 01:06:37.566]  It's awesome.
[01:06:37.907 --> 01:06:39.928]  You know, I've been listening to you for about six months now.
[01:06:39.988 --> 01:06:40.629]  It's just amazing.
[01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:43.331]  I just want to speak about the Deborah Medina thing.
[01:06:44.132 --> 01:06:48.475]  Some people are saying that she's getting blackmailed, but even if she is, like, she should stand up for herself, you know?
[01:06:48.515 --> 01:06:51.718]  Like, if she did something at college or whatever, people make mistakes.
[01:06:51.738 --> 01:06:53.599]  Stand up, tell the truth, you know, get it out there.
[01:06:53.619 --> 01:06:54.620]  Well, I want to be clear.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.022]  There's no evidence that she's being blackmailed.
[01:06:57.062 --> 01:07:00.305]  A couple callers have said that, and I've said there's no evidence of that.
[01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:04.891]  And, again, new listeners are tuning in every millisecond.
[01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:07.472]  That's Lady Running for Governor here in Texas that we've been supporting.
[01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:11.933]  And the whole Glenn Beck thing happened, where he said she was a 9-11 truther.
[01:07:11.953 --> 01:07:13.613]  She said, no, I support people's right.
[01:07:13.913 --> 01:07:15.074]  She said it's, quote, healthy.
[01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:17.034]  Those towers did fall in a strange way.
[01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:25.737]  And then she said, days later, it's despicable and horrible and agreed that we're this dangerous cult.
[01:07:26.497 --> 01:07:28.477]  And I'm saying, man, that's quite a flip-flop.
[01:07:28.517 --> 01:07:29.418]  That hurts my feelings.
[01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:30.598]  I didn't know I was despicable.
[01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:35.490]  Uh, and so I'm saying, what are they going to say about this?
[01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:36.470]  I'm angry about this.
[01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:38.271]  And most people agree and are angry.
[01:07:38.331 --> 01:07:40.192]  If you say no, she is God.
[01:07:40.492 --> 01:07:41.773]  You don't question Obama.
[01:07:41.973 --> 01:07:42.893]  You don't question her.
[01:07:43.173 --> 01:07:44.314]  You don't question Glenn Beck.
[01:07:44.654 --> 01:07:49.896]  You know, just everybody has their own little camp followers where it's just worship, worship, worship.
[01:07:49.936 --> 01:07:51.057]  And that's not who I am.
[01:07:52.597 --> 01:07:52.817]  Good.
[01:07:52.957 --> 01:07:53.558]  You got to stand up.
[01:07:53.858 --> 01:07:57.499]  You know, lots of people died for you guys to have the freedom of speech and you know, you got to fight for that.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:58.560]  Um,
[01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:06.476]  You know, and it's another thing about Glenn Beck, you know, you could tell he's a phony because he goes there and he calls 9-11 truthers morons and idiots and stuff like that.
[01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:11.139]  But if he's actually a real American, he'd actually be like, good, question your government.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.741]  No, he says a lot more.
[01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:15.903]  He says we're going to stage terror attacks and murder Obama.
[01:08:16.964 --> 01:08:20.006]  Yeah, but it's him pushing everybody towards violence though, right?
[01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:21.329]  Absolutely.
[01:08:21.369 --> 01:08:22.270]  I appreciate your call.
[01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:36.459]  Days before the attack last Thursday in Austin, he was saying that these Tea Party people who are birthers are only 5% when the polls show it's more than half of Republicans question the birth certificate.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.101]  And he was saying 9-11 Truth is 5% of the population.
[01:08:40.322 --> 01:08:40.922]  Another lie.
[01:08:41.182 --> 01:08:43.944]  And that we're all dangerous anti-Americans and violent.
[01:08:45.384 --> 01:08:53.550]  And then he put Debra Medina's picture up on the blackboard next to Van Jones and said, these people hate America.
[01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:55.711]  And I came to her defense and said, this is horrible.
[01:08:56.652 --> 01:09:01.435]  And instead, her response is just to grovel, prostrate herself before Glenn Beck.
[01:09:02.676 --> 01:09:04.497]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:09:05.498 --> 01:09:06.599]  And throw us under the bus.
[01:09:06.619 --> 01:09:09.421]  But I guess I'm supposed to say, that's alright, that's good.
[01:09:12.435 --> 01:09:17.480]  But again, it only seems to be, from what I've seen, a few people that are even in her campaign think they're going to get a job or something.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.601]  It's like we're big city politics or something.
[01:09:19.621 --> 01:09:21.443]  They're like, no, it doesn't matter what she does.
[01:09:21.643 --> 01:09:22.724]  We've got to do this to win.
[01:09:22.744 --> 01:09:25.106]  You know, we've got to be deceptive.
[01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:26.067]  What?
[01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.770]  And some people are like, Alex is very Machiavellian.
[01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:32.613]  He's trying to make it look like she's not a lot of a non-liberal truther to save her.
[01:09:32.873 --> 01:09:33.054]  What?
[01:09:33.774 --> 01:09:34.195]  Save her?
[01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:36.116]  What Beck did to her really hurt her.
[01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:38.417]  Set again in 5 points a week.
[01:09:38.557 --> 01:09:40.918]  Two weeks after, she's lost 5 points.
[01:09:40.958 --> 01:09:42.278]  That's 15 she's lost.
[01:09:42.978 --> 01:09:44.858]  10 she should have gotten on track, and the 5.
[01:09:45.259 --> 01:09:46.479]  She's got a 20 point now.
[01:09:48.379 --> 01:09:55.140]  And by her going into a tailspin and retracting, like she's bad or something, people don't like that.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.181]  No one likes that.
[01:09:56.881 --> 01:09:58.681]  But, whatever.
[01:09:59.061 --> 01:09:59.681]  It's too bad.
[01:10:00.641 --> 01:10:02.922]  Let's go ahead and talk to Neil in Jersey.
[01:10:02.982 --> 01:10:03.702]  Neil, you're on the air.
[01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:06.836]  Neil?
[01:10:06.856 --> 01:10:10.179]  Okay, let's move on to Harold in Florida.
[01:10:10.199 --> 01:10:10.960]  Harold, you're on the air.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:11.440]  Go ahead.
[01:10:13.402 --> 01:10:13.642]  Alex?
[01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:14.483]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:16.604 --> 01:10:17.345]  This is Harold.
[01:10:18.406 --> 01:10:20.007]  I haven't called you in a number of years.
[01:10:20.067 --> 01:10:21.428]  I listen on shortwave.
[01:10:21.729 --> 01:10:23.630]  I'm a senior citizen.
[01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:30.155]  It's getting a little non-articulate, I'll say, but I do have...
[01:10:32.364 --> 01:10:35.885]  All about 99% agreement on everything you say.
[01:10:37.005 --> 01:10:45.826]  Medina, the stack thing, the 9-11 truth, Oklahoma City, Glenn Beck, Ruby Ridge, Waco, the whole thing.
[01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:57.228]  When you go off the air on shortwave, I guess the switch will get cut off on my receiver, like it has on my television.
[01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:01.529]  You always say you choose your battles.
[01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:03.642]  I agree with that.
[01:11:04.082 --> 01:11:10.544]  You make tactical decisions, some I can't quite comprehend, perhaps.
[01:11:11.784 --> 01:11:21.026]  But there is a question I'd like to ask, and I'm sure your friends out here, and me included, would like to hear.
[01:11:22.247 --> 01:11:31.549]  What's the difference, and I'm going to use the buzzwords, of not being a truther, or in your case,
[01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:35.643]  Not being a birther, okay?
[01:11:36.524 --> 01:11:44.668]  I'd like to hear a comprehensive explanation from both you and Deborah Medina.
[01:11:46.569 --> 01:11:53.674]  Well, I tell you what, I don't even know her position on the birther thing, but the guys were in there watching a video of her on national TV getting slapped around by CNN.
[01:11:53.754 --> 01:11:55.795]  I don't know why people keep putting her on there.
[01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:57.236]  Stay there.
[01:11:57.276 --> 01:11:59.097]  I want to understand your question when we come back.
[01:12:01.038 --> 01:12:06.402]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[01:12:06.502 --> 01:12:08.524]  Do you care as much about your air and water?
[01:12:08.804 --> 01:12:12.427]  Lock out harmful poisons from entering your body with Air and Aqua dot com.

[01:12:30.561 --> 01:12:39.847]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:12:39.887 --> 01:12:40.628]  This capitalism?
[01:12:40.668 --> 01:12:46.812]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:12:46.932 --> 01:12:47.773]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:12:47.813 --> 01:12:50.915]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:51.855]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:52.916]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:53.556]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:53.596 --> 01:12:53.877]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:13:02.882 --> 01:13:03.922]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:13:04.322 --> 01:13:09.804]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:13:10.384 --> 01:13:10.885]  That's right.
[01:13:11.205 --> 01:13:13.485]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:13:14.046 --> 01:13:20.968]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:13:21.528 --> 01:13:29.214]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:34.518]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:13:35.159 --> 01:13:40.143]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:40.964 --> 01:13:45.067]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:47.649]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:48.329 --> 01:13:50.511]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:13:50.811 --> 01:13:53.133]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:53.293 --> 01:13:58.298]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:02.381 --> 01:14:06.024]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:14:06.384 --> 01:14:09.406]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:14:09.627 --> 01:14:11.048]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:14.391]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:20.652]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:14:20.792 --> 01:14:25.833]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:14:25.993 --> 01:14:35.975]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:14:36.095 --> 01:14:38.196]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:14:38.437 --> 01:14:39.778]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:14:40.038 --> 01:14:42.319]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:44.321]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:14:44.621 --> 01:14:49.404]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:15:57.449 --> 01:15:59.870]  Okay, Harold, from Florida, specifically.
[01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:06.694]  You're saying, what's the difference between a birther and a truther?
[01:16:06.914 --> 01:16:09.535]  Explain that question for me.
[01:16:26.519 --> 01:16:27.839]  That was not the question.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:42.023]  The question was, uh, I understand what Debra Medina said on her, uh, on the Limbaugh show about her stand there.
[01:16:42.183 --> 01:16:46.145]  And I considered that her stand was despicable.
[01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:47.565]  Okay.
[01:16:47.745 --> 01:16:54.487]  But as far as being, whether she was a truth or not, and to use those words,
[01:16:55.689 --> 01:17:10.793]  I don't understand, however, and this is your program, you can throw me off, you pay the bill, but I don't understand your position on your stand where you said, I am not a burglar.
[01:17:11.473 --> 01:17:23.036]  I believe the Barack Obama presidency is a total fraud and I see a comparison here between her not being a truther
[01:17:24.102 --> 01:17:25.643]  And you not being a birther.
[01:17:27.264 --> 01:17:28.065]  Hold just a second.
[01:17:28.445 --> 01:17:37.712]  Article 2 of our Republic Constitution, Section 1, says that the President has to be a natural born citizen.
[01:17:38.172 --> 01:17:38.812]  Let me stop you.
[01:17:38.872 --> 01:17:39.953]  I understand the question now.
[01:17:41.014 --> 01:17:41.915]  And it's a good question.
[01:17:43.376 --> 01:17:46.938]  Number one, we've had Phil Berg on here repeatedly.
[01:17:47.018 --> 01:17:50.341]  We had him on back when this wasn't even on the radar screen during the campaign.
[01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:54.533]  Okay, and I do think there's a cover-up going on.
[01:17:54.673 --> 01:18:03.677]  I've said I don't know, and I've said I think it's legitimate, but I can't call myself a complete birther because I don't know.
[01:18:04.497 --> 01:18:11.940]  Something like 9-11, I have so much evidence, and it does appear that he's not... We know his real name was Barry Zitaro.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:19.523]  We know he did go to these Muslim schools in foreign countries, and the media would pooh-pooh that a year ago, right after he got in office.
[01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:25.605]  And so, one of the first places people heard about the birth certificate issue was here.
[01:18:26.445 --> 01:18:26.805]  Okay?
[01:18:26.865 --> 01:18:33.768]  And I also had... Oh, who's the guy that wrote The Late Great USA on over and over again about it?
[01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:36.789]  I'm having one of those moments.
[01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:39.610]  Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:44.912]  I have had constant... I just don't hammer it because I can prove
[01:18:46.038 --> 01:18:52.361]  He's lying about torture, that he wouldn't do it, or hiring lobbyists, or new wars, or the Patriot Act that he would get rid of.
[01:18:52.761 --> 01:19:00.924]  And so, in fall of the republic, and in Obama deception, we don't get into that, because I wanted it to be things that were 100%.
[01:19:01.984 --> 01:19:04.605]  Now, you're missing the boat here.
[01:19:05.986 --> 01:19:12.288]  I am not criticizing Debra Medina for saying that 9-11 truthers are despicable.
[01:19:12.509 --> 01:19:13.309]  That's pretty bad.
[01:19:14.505 --> 01:19:19.488]  The issue is, she said that we're good, healthy people, asking serious questions.
[01:19:19.528 --> 01:19:21.009]  She has questions about the Towers.
[01:19:21.349 --> 01:19:27.413]  We have a right, over and over and over and over again, daring back after back, and then flip-flopped.
[01:19:27.553 --> 01:19:28.513]  It's flip-flopping!
[01:19:29.034 --> 01:19:31.095]  I've always said I don't know about the birth certificate.
[01:19:31.115 --> 01:19:34.437]  There's a lot of evidence, but they're covering it up, that he isn't a citizen.
[01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:39.080]  So, if I wasn't clear on that, I'm sorry.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.221]  But it's a totally different issue.
[01:19:41.261 --> 01:19:42.362]  Now, what do you say to that, Harold?
[01:19:43.135 --> 01:19:48.318]  Okay, you had Rick Perry for 14 years, and you know where he stands.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.661]  Debra Medina, I agree.
[01:19:53.342 --> 01:19:56.244]  I was very disappointed to hear her say what she said.
[01:19:56.944 --> 01:20:00.486]  I was very disappointed to hear you say you were not a birther.
[01:20:00.586 --> 01:20:01.967]  She said she's not a truther.
[01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:11.253]  No, I don't... You know, what I'm saying here is, I would like to hear a real comprehensive airing of both of these stands, personally.
[01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.254]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[01:20:13.947 --> 01:20:23.954]  When did you hear me say, I've said I wouldn't call myself, I remember saying that, a complete birther saying a birther believes he wasn't born here.
[01:20:24.315 --> 01:20:27.717]  I'm saying there's a cover up and it may be true and we've investigated.
[01:20:28.177 --> 01:20:29.698]  I've only said I'm investigating.
[01:20:32.716 --> 01:20:35.118]  And I just don't think you even heard what I just said to you.
[01:20:36.019 --> 01:20:42.963]  It's the saying 9-11 truth is a legitimate research position and then saying it's despicable a week and a half later.
[01:20:43.303 --> 01:20:44.584]  That's my issue, sir.
[01:20:45.105 --> 01:20:47.206]  And I've been saying that since yesterday.
[01:20:47.586 --> 01:20:49.067]  That's why I'm concerned.
[01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:49.908]  But you know what?
[01:20:49.928 --> 01:20:50.808]  I've already meant to do this.
[01:20:50.848 --> 01:20:52.249]  I want to get Phil Berg back on.
[01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:56.032]  We have a video interview we've done that I want to put up for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:20:56.332 --> 01:20:58.514]  Just we're bogged down trying to finish up Vermus's film.
[01:20:59.194 --> 01:21:00.155]  It's an excellent film.
[01:21:00.775 --> 01:21:01.936]  We're just on that.
[01:21:03.138 --> 01:21:05.284]  And I have actually been doing research.
[01:21:05.304 --> 01:21:08.412]  See, I'm not sure about Joseph Stack.
[01:21:09.318 --> 01:21:13.140]  But a lot of evidence points towards it being an inside job with the kamikaze attack.
[01:21:13.481 --> 01:21:14.521]  So we're looking at that.
[01:21:15.122 --> 01:21:18.344]  I wasn't sure for a week or so about the underwear bomber.
[01:21:18.544 --> 01:21:20.725]  That doesn't mean I'm not saying it couldn't be an inside job.
[01:21:21.065 --> 01:21:22.566]  We're here collating the information.
[01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:24.668]  But I appreciate your question, Harold.
[01:21:25.168 --> 01:21:35.114]  And you're specifically saying you'd like to hear Debra Medina on our website or on this show or some other show give a complex, detailed answer like I just gave on the birther issue.
[01:21:35.154 --> 01:21:36.375]  I think that's totally legitimate.
[01:21:36.943 --> 01:21:41.385]  But, uh, you're missing the forest for the trees, though, on why I'm concerned.
[01:21:41.405 --> 01:21:44.046]  And nothing to do with whether she's a 9-11 truther or not.
[01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.907]  And I've been saying that since yesterday when I broached this subject.
[01:21:46.927 --> 01:21:49.068]  More calls, tons of news, straight ahead.
[01:21:51.168 --> 01:21:52.069]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.549 --> 01:21:54.170]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:57.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.407 --> 01:22:04.649]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:22:04.949 --> 01:22:05.570]  Number one.
[01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:09.032]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:09.852]  Number two.
[01:22:10.152 --> 01:22:14.715]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:22:15.035 --> 01:22:15.495]  It's true.
[01:22:15.795 --> 01:22:20.338]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:22:20.658 --> 01:22:21.199]  Number 3.
[01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:24.761]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:22:25.062 --> 01:22:28.784]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:29.525]  Number 4.
[01:22:29.785 --> 01:22:32.147]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:22:32.527 --> 01:22:35.930]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:36.430]  Number 5.
[01:22:37.011 --> 01:22:40.934]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:22:41.154 --> 01:22:45.918]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:22:46.198 --> 01:22:50.221]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:22:50.361 --> 01:22:51.922]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:23:02.348 --> 01:23:05.991]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:09.393]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:09.613 --> 01:23:11.014]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:23:11.713 --> 01:23:14.374]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:14.394 --> 01:23:20.596]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:20.776 --> 01:23:25.818]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:23:26.158 --> 01:23:35.941]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:23:36.081 --> 01:23:38.181]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:38.422 --> 01:23:39.742]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:40.002 --> 01:23:42.282]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:23:42.462 --> 01:23:44.303]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:49.404]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:49.744 --> 01:23:54.505]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:24:05.518 --> 01:24:06.538]  Afraid to answer it?
[01:24:07.479 --> 01:24:08.959]  Afraid to answer your door?
[01:24:09.379 --> 01:24:16.402]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[01:24:16.682 --> 01:24:18.723]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[01:24:18.903 --> 01:24:20.663]  They are expensive payment plans.
[01:24:20.924 --> 01:24:25.425]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?
[01:24:25.765 --> 01:24:29.907]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.

[01:25:00.896 --> 01:25:18.789]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss, another flash.
[01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:26.115]  Rasmussen over the last three days, before this latest gaffe came out, and no one likes indecision or flip-flopping,
[01:25:27.335 --> 01:25:30.756]  They conducted a poll on Monday and Tuesday over a two-day period.
[01:25:31.236 --> 01:25:36.618]  It came out this morning, Dallas Morning News, that Medina is now at 16 points.
[01:25:36.658 --> 01:25:44.440]  She was at 24, slid to 20 in the last two weeks, slid to 16, and other polls are showing similar.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.421]  Hutchinson is slipping, and Perry is
[01:25:49.005 --> 01:25:52.827]  I mean, Republican voters, mainline, want to feel like they're winners.
[01:25:53.287 --> 01:25:58.390]  And see, when Beck said, you're not a winner, you can't win, they said, well, we don't want to vote for somebody who isn't a winner.
[01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:03.753]  And then I guess the Medina people just panicked and said, we hate the truthers.
[01:26:04.633 --> 01:26:06.674]  In fact, the guys are in there watching her on CNN.
[01:26:06.974 --> 01:26:11.497]  Did you guys ever find out in that transcript whether she went after birthers?
[01:26:13.717 --> 01:26:14.998]  Because that'll be another example.
[01:26:15.378 --> 01:26:18.781]  I believe I brought birther stuff up to her before and she said people have a right to investigate.
[01:26:19.561 --> 01:26:21.523]  I mean, will they be despicable like Glenn Beck says?
[01:26:21.803 --> 01:26:24.265]  Glenn Beck says you're despicable and bad if you're a birther.
[01:26:24.885 --> 01:26:25.966]  I say more power to you.
[01:26:26.006 --> 01:26:27.107]  It's your right to research it.
[01:26:27.427 --> 01:26:28.628]  Looks like there's something there.
[01:26:29.949 --> 01:26:31.010]  But here it is.
[01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:32.451]  Latest Rasmussen poem.
[01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:34.092]  Perry, 48.
[01:26:34.172 --> 01:26:34.832]  Hutchinson, 27.
[01:26:35.993 --> 01:26:36.374]  Medina, 16.
[01:26:42.028 --> 01:26:44.370]  If he gains another two points, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:50.877]  In fact, go to the Dallas Morning News and click on the Rasmussen itself.
[01:26:51.878 --> 01:26:53.680]  I want to put the actual Rasmussen up on.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.943]  Yeah, it's right here.
[01:26:56.983 --> 01:27:00.307]  It says, latest Rasmussen poll, Perry 48, Hutchinson 27, Medina 16.
[01:27:03.119 --> 01:27:20.851]  Uh, by Mike Hashimoto, and it says the Rasmussen poll in the Texas gubernatorial primary is out, and the news appears pretty good for Governor Rick Perry, who has picked up four points to 48% since the start of the month, compared to the last two Rasmussen polls.
[01:27:22.231 --> 01:27:31.537]  Kay Bailey Hutchinson is down two points from 29-27, but interestingly, Deborah Medina is polling at the same 16% as she was before she briefly lost her mind on Glenn Beck's 9-1-1
[01:27:33.277 --> 01:27:34.238]  Truth or Inquisition?
[01:27:34.258 --> 01:27:34.998]  Well, that's not right.
[01:27:35.038 --> 01:27:36.099]  She was above 20 then.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:42.684]  With early voting underway, Rasmussen asked those who voted already which way they went.
[01:27:43.045 --> 01:27:45.647]  The answer, Perry 49, Hutchinson 24, Medina 20.
[01:27:45.687 --> 01:27:47.969]  See, she was at 20 or above before.
[01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:49.990]  It's too bad.
[01:27:50.751 --> 01:27:58.217]  Perry is very close to avoiding a runoff, which could save his campaign a fair bit of money that could also apply to the general.
[01:27:59.284 --> 01:28:00.544]  Election against Bill White.
[01:28:01.125 --> 01:28:13.569]  That said, it will be interesting to see if any Democrats take Paul Bucca's suggestion and cross over to vote for Hutchinson, thereby increasing chances of a Perry weakening runoff.
[01:28:16.192 --> 01:28:22.735]  Take on the primaries and a couple of out-of-state representatives visit, and it's got the link to that.
[01:28:22.775 --> 01:28:25.696]  Isn't Mark Davis the radio talk show host?
[01:28:25.716 --> 01:28:26.557]  Yeah, he writes for them.
[01:28:26.977 --> 01:28:30.779]  He's the one that threw Medina under the bus again in the last few days.
[01:28:31.559 --> 01:28:38.202]  Even after she denied anything decent with 9-11 Truth, he then attacked her again and said, well, that just shows you don't have good judgment.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.382]  And again, this is a great example for people in other states.
[01:28:43.003 --> 01:28:47.566]  When you run for governor or run for state legislature, don't end up this way.
[01:28:48.106 --> 01:28:49.167]  Don't flip-flop.
[01:28:49.527 --> 01:28:50.247]  Don't do this.
[01:28:50.488 --> 01:28:54.390]  Look, if she would have said, look, the commission says investigate.
[01:28:54.490 --> 01:28:58.013]  I'm only questioning the majority of Americans in this poll do, Glenn.
[01:28:58.393 --> 01:28:59.654]  What are you afraid of questions?
[01:29:00.234 --> 01:29:03.957]  She wouldn't then have lost all the 9-11 truth or votes.
[01:29:04.017 --> 01:29:05.098]  People got mad at her.
[01:29:07.486 --> 01:29:12.569]  Press release she put out that day, two weeks ago, and the rest of it, and I defended her and said, that's okay.
[01:29:13.089 --> 01:29:14.110]  That's alright.
[01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:16.271]  You know, we still need to support her.
[01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:20.013]  You know, she can still win if you get out there and do it.
[01:29:20.894 --> 01:29:24.976]  And no one likes flip-flopping.
[01:29:26.937 --> 01:29:33.541]  And we can now know in other races around the country, they're going to try this again in the future.
[01:29:33.561 --> 01:29:39.764]  Okay, I want to get into this DHS news that I've been talking about all day, but first let's jam in some more calls.
[01:29:40.344 --> 01:29:41.645]  Really fast now.
[01:29:41.665 --> 01:29:43.166]  I am giving people one minute.
[01:29:43.566 --> 01:29:44.606]  Tyler in Canada.
[01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:45.347]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:29:45.927 --> 01:29:49.049]  Hey Alex, I'm 17, been listening for like a year and a half.
[01:29:49.329 --> 01:29:50.289]  I listen every day.
[01:29:50.329 --> 01:29:51.290]  Got two quick questions.
[01:29:51.874 --> 01:29:55.017]  What are the chances that herb could be used to fake global warming effects?
[01:29:55.197 --> 01:30:01.122]  And what about the possibility of the flipping of the Earth's magnetic polarity, thus freezing the people in the lower hemisphere?
[01:30:02.435 --> 01:30:04.676]  Well, that's an excellent group of questions.
[01:30:05.836 --> 01:30:08.517]  The Pentagon admits they have weather weapons since the 60s.
[01:30:09.177 --> 01:30:13.719]  The Secretary of Defense in 97 gave a speech, Cohen did, admitting they have it.
[01:30:14.259 --> 01:30:22.222]  Tectonic weapons, weather weapons, and yes, they can engage in weather weapon operations to scare people into submission.
[01:30:23.042 --> 01:30:42.610]  Or, scare you with regular weather and say it's abnormal and Bill Gates, the Pentagon, they're all in the news, the White House science czars saying, we're already been practicing terraforming, spraying chemicals in the air, that's the chemtrailing, and now we want to go even more massive and do this publicly to save the Earth from global warming.
[01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:46.971]  So it's also a cover for all their weather modification, manipulation that's going on.
[01:30:47.412 --> 01:30:47.912]  Just like
[01:30:48.792 --> 01:30:51.414]  Laptops are spying on you with the cameras and microphones.
[01:30:51.794 --> 01:30:52.615]  And people didn't believe it.
[01:30:52.655 --> 01:30:53.555]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:30:54.056 --> 01:30:56.297]  Just like they're taking baby's blood at birth.
[01:30:56.337 --> 01:30:57.999]  People didn't believe me even when I had the documents.
[01:30:58.019 --> 01:30:58.859]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:30:58.879 --> 01:30:59.440]  They do believe it.
[01:31:00.302 --> 01:31:02.604]  It's all documented they're manipulating the weather.
[01:31:02.904 --> 01:31:05.066]  That they could create, control, steer hurricanes.
[01:31:05.566 --> 01:31:10.009]  Stanford Research Institute, Naval Weapons Lab, Ben Livingston, 1967, certified.
[01:31:10.289 --> 01:31:12.791]  They've been doing it since the early 60s, but certified in the 60s.
[01:31:13.391 --> 01:31:17.895]  It isn't real because people don't see it all over the news, but it's been declassified.
[01:31:18.515 --> 01:31:19.716]  And so, excellent question.
[01:31:19.736 --> 01:31:21.057]  The other one was about pole shifts.
[01:31:21.337 --> 01:31:23.219]  The pole has been moving an unusual amount.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:37.648]  In the North and the South, and it does flip around, and the planet does move around and do things, and it... I mean, all the continents were once together in Pangaea.
[01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:40.090]  I mean, who knows what could happen?
[01:31:40.130 --> 01:31:41.331]  Giant meteors hit us.
[01:31:41.711 --> 01:31:44.613]  The point is, the only thing that's constant is change.
[01:31:45.654 --> 01:31:52.318]  Okay, let's go to... Let's go to Jerry in Florida.
[01:31:52.358 --> 01:31:53.179]  Jerry, you're on the air.
[01:31:54.147 --> 01:31:57.349]  Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure to get through.
[01:31:57.709 --> 01:32:06.693]  I just, real quick, wanted to compliment you on your impeccable Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonation.
[01:32:06.753 --> 01:32:10.315]  I listen to you all the time and when you kick into one of your rants,
[01:32:10.737 --> 01:32:12.217]  Can you get going on that, dude?
[01:32:12.298 --> 01:32:13.138]  I'd just die.
[01:32:13.158 --> 01:32:16.499]  The Tea Party people are nothing!
[01:32:16.539 --> 01:32:17.179]  They're all weak!
[01:32:17.559 --> 01:32:19.620]  We would ignore them, roll over them.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.300]  Stop it.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.380]  Stop it, you.
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:22.021]  No.
[01:32:22.081 --> 01:32:22.621]  Hey, listen.
[01:32:22.801 --> 01:32:23.221]  No.
[01:32:24.061 --> 01:32:25.062]  Steroids.
[01:32:25.902 --> 01:32:35.065]  Yeah, what I wanted to comment on was the clip that you were playing with the Medina being interviewed by that guy who was
[01:32:36.482 --> 01:32:43.608]  Basically, in a nutshell, I think we've all pretty much heard it, saying that truthers, oh, well, that's good, you're not a truther.
[01:32:43.648 --> 01:32:52.976]  Well, my question to him would have been, well, if I'm not a truther, then what am I supposed to be?
[01:32:53.156 --> 01:32:53.897]  A liar?
[01:32:54.137 --> 01:32:54.678]  A liar?
[01:32:55.598 --> 01:33:00.363]  No thanks, I think I'll stick with truth, because regardless of what the truth is, it's the truth.
[01:33:00.403 --> 01:33:01.844]  That doesn't make you a bad person.
[01:33:02.164 --> 01:33:04.246]  If we all turn out to be lunatics,
[01:33:04.685 --> 01:33:15.012]  And the buildings really did fall under the circumstances that we've all been led to believe, then okay, we're wrong, but all we were seeking was the truth that doesn't make us bad people.
[01:33:15.193 --> 01:33:29.182]  No, no, I mean everything today, and I appreciate your call, it's a great point, it's got to move on though so everybody gets on, is that the government has declassified that they've staged many terror attacks and proposed staged terror attacks in the past.
[01:33:29.823 --> 01:33:33.766]  So questioning that, questioning an event when government stands to gain,
[01:33:35.799 --> 01:33:38.901]  Like we did on the flu, or WMDs, or anything.
[01:33:39.181 --> 01:33:40.743]  That's the only position to have.
[01:33:40.763 --> 01:33:49.569]  I mean, if you've got a neighbor that's robbed you two or three times, and you come home and your house is robbed again, you're gonna look at the neighbor who's done it before.
[01:33:50.269 --> 01:33:54.853]  And then, the neighbor comes out and says, it's despicable of you to question me.
[01:33:56.715 --> 01:33:57.295]  It's incredible.
[01:33:58.095 --> 01:34:07.798]  So they're trying to create this illusion that it's not proper to ask questions, and it's evil, and it's violent, and it's horrible, and it's a cult, and it's, oh, because they're mad we won't shut up and go away.
[01:34:07.818 --> 01:34:12.079]  We have internal White House documents from Cass Sunstein that we're their big enemy.
[01:34:12.879 --> 01:34:14.459]  And look at Beck and look at the White House.
[01:34:14.479 --> 01:34:16.720]  They're together on this, attacking us.
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:19.841]  What are they so afraid of if it's so ridiculous?
[01:34:19.861 --> 01:34:22.541]  All right, let's go back to our phone system.
[01:34:22.601 --> 01:34:23.562]  John in Michigan.
[01:34:23.582 --> 01:34:24.202]  You're on the air.
[01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:24.822]  Go ahead, John.
[01:34:25.819 --> 01:34:26.759]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:27.520]  Pretty good.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:32.602]  Hey, I got two quick questions, but I wanted to make a comment about people attacking you.
[01:34:33.402 --> 01:34:34.183]  Yes, I love it.
[01:34:35.663 --> 01:34:46.068]  I just want to say your actions speak for themselves, and that's the only thing they can do to slow you down is to distract you and try and get you off your game.
[01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:49.069]  And for every attack, they're just introducing
[01:34:50.792 --> 01:34:59.700]  People who never would have heard of you anyhow, they're introducing you to people who would have never heard of you, and unintentionally planting seeds for us.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.742]  No, that's the big dirty secret.
[01:35:03.043 --> 01:35:06.305]  And no matter how nasty the lies, how elaborately ridiculous,
[01:35:07.086 --> 01:35:09.907]  In the end, it only helps us reach new people.
[01:35:10.887 --> 01:35:16.248]  I mean, people attacking us is a small stream of new listeners, but it's still substantive.
[01:35:16.648 --> 01:35:23.910]  Every person we're able to really reach out to and really wake up is invaluable.
[01:35:24.791 --> 01:35:30.152]  The attacks from mainstream media don't even send us that many people because
[01:35:31.724 --> 01:35:33.606]  Mainstream media doesn't have that many viewers anymore.
[01:35:34.166 --> 01:35:35.287]  I mean, that's the big illusion.
[01:35:35.367 --> 01:35:41.152]  People will spend all this money on big mainstream TV, radio, print, and it doesn't get you a good response.
[01:35:41.833 --> 01:35:43.294]  Because people aren't listening.
[01:35:43.674 --> 01:35:50.901]  And mainstream media is so discredited now, that when they attack me, it only makes people go, well, I better check this guy out.
[01:35:50.921 --> 01:35:52.322]  I mean, take Texas Monthly.
[01:35:53.496 --> 01:35:54.316]  Cover story on me.
[01:35:54.957 --> 01:35:55.637]  This month's issue.
[01:35:55.777 --> 01:35:56.997]  I wouldn't call it a hit piece.
[01:35:57.618 --> 01:36:02.039]  It's got website names wrong, dates of key things wrong, even though I told them.
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:08.222]  It's got distortions like, oh, there's really no plan to exterminate the majority of the population.
[01:36:08.622 --> 01:36:11.483]  Alex sent me one document and it said a little bit of that.
[01:36:11.603 --> 01:36:12.704]  No, I sent him a whole bunch.
[01:36:13.544 --> 01:36:13.884]  Okay?
[01:36:15.405 --> 01:36:20.727]  And so almost every comment on the article agrees with me and is giving them sources of where I said things.
[01:36:21.367 --> 01:36:22.428]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:36:22.468 --> 01:36:22.868]  Anything else?
[01:36:23.934 --> 01:36:25.556]  Go ahead.
[01:36:26.277 --> 01:36:28.459]  Are you kidding?
[01:36:28.479 --> 01:36:29.520]  90% of what I get is love!
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:29.740]  I love it!
[01:36:43.050 --> 01:36:43.330]  Yes.
[01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:44.791]  Thank you.
[01:36:44.951 --> 01:36:46.631]  Real fast, the question, because I've got to get to others.
[01:36:47.571 --> 01:36:48.691]  Both Bin Laden related.
[01:36:49.251 --> 01:36:51.032]  One is just really short.
[01:36:51.312 --> 01:36:52.732]  What is the BCCI Bank?
[01:36:52.852 --> 01:37:01.593]  And the other one is Sudan offered Bill, better relations with the U.S., Sudan offered Bin Laden to Bill Clinton.
[01:37:01.893 --> 01:37:04.194]  What was Bill Clinton's response to Sudan?
[01:37:05.734 --> 01:37:10.755]  That was in 1996, and he said, we don't want him.
[01:37:12.745 --> 01:37:13.546]  Did he blow up?
[01:37:13.606 --> 01:37:15.727]  Did he attack them?
[01:37:15.867 --> 01:37:18.189]  Did he bomb their pharmaceutical plant?
[01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:20.511]  Yes, he did.
[01:37:20.551 --> 01:37:21.531]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:22.552 --> 01:37:23.252]  Let's go ahead.
[01:37:23.292 --> 01:37:24.313]  Yeah, they cruise-missiled it.
[01:37:24.974 --> 01:37:27.315]  Let's go ahead and talk to Isaac in Texas.
[01:37:27.455 --> 01:37:28.256]  Isaac, you're on the air.
[01:37:29.657 --> 01:37:29.897]  Yes.
[01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:31.738]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:37:32.119 --> 01:37:32.339]  Good.
[01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:39.289]  Personal question, uh, what do you think we ought to go ahead and vote for?
[01:37:39.389 --> 01:37:45.552]  And is there any hope for Texas to do the stage terror, uh, the body scanners and Debra Medina flip-flopping?
[01:37:46.772 --> 01:37:49.333]  Well, I mean, look, I think you should still vote for Debra Medina.
[01:37:49.374 --> 01:37:51.434]  I don't think people who voted for her wasted a vote.
[01:37:52.195 --> 01:37:57.097]  I just, being called despicable and watching her flip-flop is very painful and hurt me.
[01:37:57.697 --> 01:37:59.217]  And so that's why I'm upset about it.
[01:37:59.277 --> 01:38:04.580]  And now some of the responses I'm seeing from the campaign, I mean, for now I'm saying go ahead and vote for her.
[01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:11.963]  I just... I mean, go to her website.
[01:38:13.143 --> 01:38:15.624]  Have we gotten any response yet from these people?
[01:38:16.144 --> 01:38:17.144]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:17.944 --> 01:38:20.365]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in California.
[01:38:20.405 --> 01:38:21.165]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:38:21.205 --> 01:38:21.605]  Go ahead.
[01:38:22.385 --> 01:38:23.286]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:38:23.726 --> 01:38:23.986]  Good.
[01:38:25.546 --> 01:38:27.287]  I got a couple comments on Debra Medina.
[01:38:27.647 --> 01:38:28.487]  One real quick one here.
[01:38:28.847 --> 01:38:33.088]  You know, one of the things that bothered me the most about it was calling people despicable.
[01:38:33.108 --> 01:38:36.429]  She's basically stomping on free speech at that point in time.
[01:38:37.165 --> 01:38:39.626]  Yeah, but hey, don't criticize her.
[01:38:39.646 --> 01:38:40.166]  You're evil.
[01:38:40.186 --> 01:38:42.147]  I mean, you don't have your free speech now.
[01:38:43.107 --> 01:38:43.747]  Oh, I understand.
[01:38:44.187 --> 01:38:44.907]  I understand that.
[01:38:45.387 --> 01:38:47.828]  And here's a couple other points for you real quick.
[01:38:48.488 --> 01:38:56.451]  Twenty-six years ago, Frank Zappa, you can see the video on Musicians for Freedom, was talking about, in 1984, race-specific bioweapons.
[01:38:57.851 --> 01:38:58.932]  I've had his wife on.
[01:38:58.952 --> 01:39:00.232]  I've had his wife on.
[01:39:02.552 --> 01:39:07.881]  The last point is, I thought you might find this an interesting link between the Rothschilds and Al Gore.
[01:39:09.163 --> 01:39:14.392]  Jacob Schiff, his grandson, Andrew Schiff, is married to Al Gore's daughter Katrina.
[01:39:14.973 --> 01:39:15.915]  Yes, I've seen that.
[01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:29.458]  I find that there's no small bit of irony, in particular regarding David de Rothschild's mouthpiece for Europe regarding global warming, and then you've got Al Gore over here, and then we see some type of loose blood relationship that they've formed.
[01:39:29.998 --> 01:39:34.440]  It's like Kerry and Bush being cousins on every side of their family.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.421]  It's like a breed of dog.
[01:39:35.441 --> 01:39:36.221]  They're all related.
[01:39:36.621 --> 01:39:38.202]  Like French bulldogs or beagles.
[01:39:38.262 --> 01:39:41.263]  It's all basically one family tree.
[01:39:42.344 --> 01:39:44.345]  It's Obama's related closely to Cheney.
[01:39:46.525 --> 01:39:47.446]  It's just amazing.
[01:39:47.646 --> 01:39:50.247]  You know, people start to really look at that aspect of it.
[01:39:50.768 --> 01:39:53.289]  It's no surprise why we're at where we're at today.
[01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:54.310]  I hear you.
[01:39:54.650 --> 01:39:56.231]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:39:57.452 --> 01:40:01.034]  Okay, there's so many phone calls here.
[01:40:01.214 --> 01:40:04.416]  Who's been holding the longest on our phone system?
[01:40:06.818 --> 01:40:08.339]  Paul in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:40:08.399 --> 01:40:08.779]  Go ahead.
[01:40:12.677 --> 01:40:14.198]  Yes, he's been holding so long he's gone.
[01:40:15.498 --> 01:40:17.619]  Chris in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:40:18.539 --> 01:40:26.623]  Yeah, Alex, Jack McLam, Dr. Sam Antif, Keith, Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Jerome Corsi, Larry Pratt.
[01:40:27.463 --> 01:40:39.208]  I heard you, these are all members of the Council for National Policy that we never hear talked about on the show and there's constantly guests who are involved in rub shoulders with people like
[01:40:39.935 --> 01:41:05.104]  You know, George Bush and Alan Keyes and, you know, Alberto Gonzalez, Pat Robertson, I heard you just attacking him earlier, Dr. Dobson, and that the group for Council for National Policy is an ultra-secret right group, and I heard you talking with Peter Dale Scott about this, and you actually said, and this is a quote from you, the CNP
[01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:09.789]  He's a junior CFR.
[01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:12.931]  Well, let me be clear, and I appreciate your call.
[01:41:13.531 --> 01:41:19.615]  Look, what people do is they invent new special conspiracies that are theirs.
[01:41:20.715 --> 01:41:25.218]  Okay, and by the way, I had Peter Del Scott on ten years ago talking about the CMP.
[01:41:27.299 --> 01:41:29.420]  And for you to say I never talk about it isn't true.
[01:41:29.661 --> 01:41:31.962]  I brought it up with him when he was on, I think, the show last time.
[01:41:32.262 --> 01:41:34.263]  Burma's asked him about it for the film he's making.
[01:41:34.303 --> 01:41:34.884]  He's in there.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.061]  So, I don't work for the Republican Party.
[01:41:40.103 --> 01:41:41.463]  I have different guests on.
[01:41:41.523 --> 01:41:42.684]  I mean, I had Rothschild on.
[01:41:42.704 --> 01:41:43.825]  People say, I most like him.
[01:41:44.125 --> 01:41:45.266]  No, I had him on in security.
[01:41:45.286 --> 01:41:48.568]  In fact, we're going to skip this last break because I want to have time to look at these other two articles.
[01:41:48.628 --> 01:41:49.348]  I swear I'd get to it.
[01:41:51.549 --> 01:42:04.157]  But on this subject, that was the Hunt brothers, and they wanted to take over politics, and they were big anti-Kennedy people, and that is a right-wing thing.
[01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:10.014]  But people send me emails saying, there's proof, you're a CNP and all this.
[01:42:11.215 --> 01:42:11.716]  I'm not.
[01:42:12.336 --> 01:42:13.938]  I don't even go to Republican meetings.
[01:42:17.458 --> 01:42:19.300]  I mean, I don't go to anything.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:20.881]  It's like an inquisition.
[01:42:21.321 --> 01:42:28.987]  I'm talking about naked body scanners, cameras in your computer watching you, the IRS out of control, banks stealing trillions, bring them to justice.
[01:42:29.488 --> 01:42:32.370]  I'm interviewing Peter Dell Scott over and over again.
[01:42:32.690 --> 01:42:34.472]  He can talk about whatever he wants on this show.
[01:42:34.492 --> 01:42:39.636]  And then it's like, ooh, Alex Jones won't talk about CMP, Council on National Policy.
[01:42:40.136 --> 01:42:40.557]  Is that right?
[01:42:40.617 --> 01:42:41.658]  Council on National Policy?
[01:42:42.138 --> 01:42:46.061]  I mean, it's a group, I think back in the 80s, where
[01:42:48.908 --> 01:42:54.732]  Whether it was co-opting the anti-New World Order movement or was good and then got bad, I haven't really studied it that much.
[01:42:55.453 --> 01:42:58.395]  I just know there's all sorts of groups and interchanging organizations.
[01:42:58.415 --> 01:43:00.376]  I mean, I'm criticizing Pat Robertson.
[01:43:00.957 --> 01:43:03.058]  You're discrediting yourself with what you're saying.
[01:43:03.098 --> 01:43:04.679]  I was just talking bad about Robertson.
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:08.302]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts admits he used to be a big Republican.
[01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:09.703]  Now he comes out against him.
[01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:12.165]  I mean, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:43:13.823 --> 01:43:15.063]  I'll bring CMP up.
[01:43:15.863 --> 01:43:18.504]  Remind me guys, next time Roberts is on with us, he'll talk about it.
[01:43:19.284 --> 01:43:23.785]  I mean, I think they get together and have meetings and talk about how they want to take over the Republican Party.
[01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:25.586]  I mean, that stuff goes on everywhere.
[01:43:25.626 --> 01:43:30.987]  It's like a... There's a camp that says I work for the Jews, which I don't.
[01:43:31.267 --> 01:43:33.188]  There's a camp that says I work for the Catholics, which I don't.
[01:43:33.488 --> 01:43:35.888]  There's a camp that says I'm a Scientologist, which I'm not.
[01:43:36.328 --> 01:43:40.729]  Never been to their meeting, know nothing about it other than pretty goofy stuff from L. Ron Hubbard.
[01:43:40.749 --> 01:43:42.950]  It looks like they've done some bad things in the past.
[01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:50.640]  I mean, I'm here doing what I do.
[01:43:50.941 --> 01:43:53.166]  I'm here covering issues.
[01:43:54.758 --> 01:43:58.079]  And this is why, as a society, we are so screwed up.
[01:43:58.359 --> 01:44:00.780]  I mean, I've got people saying I work for oil companies.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.501]  That's what David Rothschild said on this show.
[01:44:02.521 --> 01:44:05.342]  You know, you work for oil companies.
[01:44:05.942 --> 01:44:08.923]  I get zero money from oil companies.
[01:44:08.943 --> 01:44:10.464]  I actually have family in East Texas.
[01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:14.805]  You know, in those areas, an oil well might bring in like 500 bucks a month or something.
[01:44:14.825 --> 01:44:16.206]  They're little teeny things.
[01:44:16.606 --> 01:44:19.187]  I think my grandma said she gets about 100 bucks a month from some
[01:44:20.247 --> 01:44:26.252]  Because the way oil wells work is somebody will have an oil well on their property, but it's like a pool, and the people with the adjoining property have got some family land in West Texas.
[01:44:26.292 --> 01:44:29.134]  I think decades ago the well wasn't played out.
[01:44:29.154 --> 01:44:30.795]  I think she got a couple hundred bucks a month off that.
[01:44:31.156 --> 01:44:32.957]  So I mean, I guess in a way it's actually true.
[01:44:33.338 --> 01:44:34.418]  I mean, I'm in Texas.
[01:44:35.359 --> 01:44:43.326]  But I mean, I'm not here saying global warming isn't real because I work for oil companies.
[01:44:44.146 --> 01:44:44.967]  Oil companies
[01:44:48.709 --> 01:45:01.592]  Most of the big ones, including Dutch Royal Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, and in Google right now, ExxonMobil in favor of carbon tax and endorses global warming.
[01:45:04.873 --> 01:45:07.353]  I mean, ClimateGate is real.
[01:45:07.753 --> 01:45:13.015]  I'm covering this because I don't want a $2.6 billion tax on my electricity in the next three years.
[01:45:13.375 --> 01:45:13.875]  In Austin,
[01:45:15.202 --> 01:45:17.423]  But no, no, I work for the oil companies.
[01:45:17.483 --> 01:45:18.864]  No, I work for me.
[01:45:19.524 --> 01:45:21.625]  I don't own any stocks, any bonds.
[01:45:22.105 --> 01:45:24.086]  I work for Alex Jones and freedom.
[01:45:24.426 --> 01:45:29.088]  And notice that we open the phones up and it's just got to be about Alex Jones.
[01:45:29.528 --> 01:45:33.069]  And that's why we can't go anywhere, because here's the deal.
[01:45:34.530 --> 01:45:41.973]  People are waking up, we're making giant strides, but people who are caught in this infighting paradigm, they can't make any strides.
[01:45:45.578 --> 01:45:47.744]  Because I don't know, it's a form of illness or something.
[01:45:48.948 --> 01:45:49.710]  I've always noticed...
[01:45:52.185 --> 01:45:55.608]  We'll have FEMA camp documents and we post them and nobody wants to read them.
[01:45:55.768 --> 01:45:56.529]  They're not popular.
[01:45:57.070 --> 01:46:03.496]  But if I post a photo of something people might think is a camp, there'll be a thousand comments and it'll go viral on the internet.
[01:46:03.896 --> 01:46:06.538]  It's like speculation is always king.
[01:46:06.598 --> 01:46:07.900]  Is this guy a reptoid?
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:10.142]  Or are chubacabras real?
[01:46:10.422 --> 01:46:12.504]  Or things like this.
[01:46:12.624 --> 01:46:15.547]  And I'm here covering real news.
[01:46:17.012 --> 01:46:18.633]  I'm here breaking news.
[01:46:18.873 --> 01:46:20.493]  I'm here documenting.
[01:46:20.973 --> 01:46:25.075]  I'm here making award-winning films and giving them to you for free.
[01:46:25.095 --> 01:46:28.456]  I hope you'll buy them on DVD at InfoWars.com and support us.
[01:46:31.137 --> 01:46:31.997]  And it's just crazy.
[01:46:32.037 --> 01:46:35.278]  You never talk about this organization, but on this show you said this about it.
[01:46:37.372 --> 01:46:39.514]  I mean, it looks like a lot of its activities are bad.
[01:46:40.274 --> 01:46:41.996]  And I said, looks like it's a junior CFR.
[01:46:42.136 --> 01:46:51.464]  I mean, hell, the CFR actually writes many of the laws, like Homeland Security and others, and immigration policy, that are implemented word for word in law.
[01:46:51.784 --> 01:46:53.826]  And I'm not saying the CFR runs everything.
[01:46:53.866 --> 01:46:57.989]  It's this mental illness about, well, you know, mainstream media every day attacks me.
[01:46:58.049 --> 01:47:04.094]  Every day there's an article saying, Jones says it's the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, CFR, Club of Rome, UN.
[01:47:04.255 --> 01:47:05.215]  Which is it, Alex?
[01:47:06.204 --> 01:47:07.085]  I didn't say that!
[01:47:09.307 --> 01:47:25.681]  If you look at who heads up all those groups, including the CMP and all these scores of groups, it's literally like a hundred people that head up all the groups and that's how they control money and power and other politically active groups, diverse groups.
[01:47:26.061 --> 01:47:27.863]  Everybody in the CFR isn't bad.
[01:47:28.544 --> 01:47:29.324]  Most of them are
[01:47:30.342 --> 01:47:34.264]  Like porch masons who were on the outside of the thing.
[01:47:34.284 --> 01:47:38.906]  And this is the management... I mean, read Carol Quigley's book, An Insider.
[01:47:39.226 --> 01:47:41.647]  He explains how all of this operates.
[01:47:42.647 --> 01:47:45.069]  And so, I'm here saying, no.
[01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:54.136]  The major Protestant groups, the major Jewish groups, the major Catholic groups, most of the major Arab countries are all part of this power alliance.
[01:47:54.436 --> 01:47:56.577]  The globalists have got deals with the Chinese rulers.
[01:47:56.717 --> 01:48:02.620]  It's the ruling class using systems of control to dominate the population.
[01:48:03.732 --> 01:48:13.016]  And the ruling class uses big government and the threat of terror and other hoaxes like phony environmentalism as an excuse to get you to give up your life, give up your freedom.
[01:48:13.276 --> 01:48:15.497]  I mean, I meant to get to this more today, but here it is at the end.
[01:48:15.537 --> 01:48:16.177]  Here's an example.
[01:48:16.798 --> 01:48:17.658]  Information Week.
[01:48:17.718 --> 01:48:21.080]  DHS may scrap border patrol project.
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:31.304]  The Department of Homeland Security is reevaluating a plan to add security cameras, radar, and sensors to patrol efforts along the U.S.-Mexican border.
[01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:36.611]  Well, they only built 50-something miles of the 2,000-plus mile fence.
[01:48:36.831 --> 01:48:37.972]  They used illegals to do that.
[01:48:38.572 --> 01:48:43.434]  But, meanwhile, all over the country, they've got checkpoints 10 miles, 20 miles, 100 miles deep.
[01:48:43.874 --> 01:48:45.514]  The Border Patrol's searching citizens.
[01:48:46.014 --> 01:48:49.396]  And here's an LA Times article about that today.
[01:48:49.736 --> 01:48:52.597]  What American border agents search and seize.
[01:48:52.617 --> 01:48:53.937]  It's the same thing as the TSA.
[01:48:54.297 --> 01:48:57.639]  They take your cell phone, they take your computer, sometimes keep it two, three months.
[01:48:58.699 --> 01:49:01.620]  Take their sweet time downloading everything off of it without a warrant.
[01:49:03.499 --> 01:49:06.464]  And giving it to law enforcement if they find anything they think is criminal.
[01:49:06.704 --> 01:49:11.892]  They just grab your electronics and just do this, and it says here they're going after citizens.
[01:49:12.713 --> 01:49:16.699]  The Border Patrol was used up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the G20.
[01:49:18.991 --> 01:49:24.694]  In the last half, in the last year and a half, civil liberties groups and businesses travel leaders have complained about U.S.
[01:49:24.714 --> 01:49:31.056]  border patrol agents, broad authority to search and seize laptops, other electronic gadgets carried by international travelers.
[01:49:31.476 --> 01:49:34.478]  The new information details the extent to which this has happened.
[01:49:35.518 --> 01:49:41.301]  And it's just a hellish article about how they're just grabbing thousands and thousands and thousands.
[01:49:45.062 --> 01:49:46.043]  In one county,
[01:49:47.807 --> 01:49:54.149]  The one that borders San Diego and Mexico.
[01:49:54.169 --> 01:49:59.450]  1,644 devices from travelers entering and leaving the country, according to data of the American Civil Liberties Union.
[01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:07.252]  And they took cell phones, laptops, digital cameras, MP3 players, flash drives, hard drives, DVDs.
[01:50:07.272 --> 01:50:09.652]  I mean, they just seize whatever they want like they're drugs.
[01:50:09.992 --> 01:50:11.353]  And now they want to do this to vitamins.
[01:50:11.393 --> 01:50:12.673]  I didn't get to John McCain.
[01:50:12.913 --> 01:50:15.754]  He's got a bill to make us like Canada to start restricting vitamins.
[01:50:16.514 --> 01:50:19.156]  See, you're being attacked by the power elite.
[01:50:19.476 --> 01:50:25.521]  You've got to get them back under the Constitution, get that hedge of protection back around us, and start slashing government.
[01:50:25.941 --> 01:50:30.524]  Instead, they're raising taxes, growing government, the whole economy's falling apart.
[01:50:30.804 --> 01:50:32.746]  The enemy is the New World Order.
[01:50:33.326 --> 01:50:38.430]  That's what we've got to get focused on, and remove these systems, instead of arguing all day about who runs it.
[01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.591]  See you back tomorrow.
[01:50:39.611 --> 01:50:40.371]  Retransmission starts now.
