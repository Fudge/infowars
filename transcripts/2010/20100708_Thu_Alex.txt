[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:01.251]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:01.972 --> 00:00:03.094]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:04.556]  You want answers?
[00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:06.239]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.566]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:14.692]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:29.836]  Well, he's the former head of the Green Party and England Championship goalie, international BBC presenter, multi-time best-selling author, and somebody who's really expanded people's paradigms and gotten them to look into a lot of very interesting places.
[00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:34.897]  And so much of what David Icke predicted more than 15 years ago, unfortunately, has unfolded.
[00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:39.378]  I agree with him that we're on the verge of a world transformation, an awakening.
[00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:42.100]  The system is panicking with Divide and Conquer.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.062]  There's no doubt they blew the oil well.
[00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:47.925]  There's no doubt they're now admitting we're going into a depression, trying to start World War III.
[00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:50.568]  They know they're losing control.
[00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:54.511]  And let me tell you, this is the most important time in human history up to this point.
[00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:55.913]  He's with us for the next hour.
[00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.215]  David Icke, thank you for being on with us.
[00:00:58.555 --> 00:00:59.035]  Pleasure, Alex.
[00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:08.822]  Well, we were just talking during that one-minute break, and you were saying that you do believe this is the quickening or the beginning of the acceleration of a real paradigm shift.
[00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:14.826]  There's a lot of issues I want to go over, but what's on David Icke's radar screen that you think is most important right now?
[00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:24.413]  Well, I think, you know, what we're seeing on the surface, horrendous as it is, is a manifestation of something that's actually much, much deeper than this.
[00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:27.139]  There's no doubt whatsoever.
[00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:32.101]  I mean, I've seen it so blatantly over the last 20 years, gathering pace and gathering pace.
[00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:34.042]  There is an awakening going on.
[00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:37.004]  It's not the majority yet, but minds are opening.
[00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:41.446]  Now, as minds are opening, they're seeing what they couldn't see before.
[00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:44.868]  And what the Cabal wants to do is keep those minds shut.
[00:01:44.888 --> 00:01:47.990]  And one of the most effective ways of doing this
[00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.496]  This is why we've got to stay really strong and focused in this period we're going through now.
[00:01:52.516 --> 00:01:55.360]  There's going to be a number of years of major challenges.
[00:01:56.255 --> 00:01:56.816]  I think
[00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:27.336]  We're good to go.
[00:02:53.779 --> 00:03:19.933]  It may seem like it's just another manufactured catastrophe in the Gulf, another war in Iran, another economic collapse, but all these things are orchestrated to fire at our minds, and our minds are the target, because from our state of perception of self and the world comes our behavior and our actions.
[00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:37.188]  That's right, I've noticed the globalists dominate by just getting our attention and always creating new crisis so we watch the mainstream television, so we pay attention to them and they dominate how we dress and what we think and what we eat and just literally get us...
[00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:52.174]  sucked into this false tapestry, this false reality that they are projecting, and now they're openly saying they want to start shutting off the web, which shows that they realize they wanted to use it as a tool of domination, but that it's backfiring against them.
[00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:53.912]  That's the word, Alex.
[00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:54.733]  Attention.
[00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:57.293]  It's a battle for our attention.
[00:03:57.913 --> 00:04:11.077]  Because the idea is to hold humanity in a state where we are filtering and seeing ourselves in the world only through the five senses.
[00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:15.578]  We are multi-dimensional consciousness awareness.
[00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:17.359]  We are far, far greater
[00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:39.071]  What we appear to be when we look in the mirror and say that's David Icke or that's Alex Jones or that's Ethel Smith and what they want us to do is keep our attention on the five senses and that's what we do when we are in fear, when we are in anxiety, when we're worrying about the future, when we have this sense of
[00:04:40.131 --> 00:04:41.212]  Fear of not surviving.
[00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:44.674]  That pulls us into the five senses, and that's what they're trying to do.
[00:04:44.814 --> 00:04:49.516]  And then the system poses as the saviors and says, we'll keep you safe, just let us run your life.
[00:04:49.877 --> 00:04:51.638]  Stay there, David Icke, back in three minutes.
[00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:53.359]  A lot of key info straight ahead.

[00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:57.391]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:57.692 --> 00:05:58.312]  Number 1.
[00:05:58.612 --> 00:06:01.775]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:02.595]  Number 2.
[00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:07.459]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:07.799 --> 00:06:08.240]  It's true.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.103]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:13.404 --> 00:06:13.964]  Number 3.
[00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:17.527]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:17.827 --> 00:06:21.530]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.271]  Number 4.
[00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:24.874]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:25.274 --> 00:06:28.659]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:29.179]  Number 5.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.685]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:33.905 --> 00:06:38.671]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.978]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:43.118 --> 00:06:44.680]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:56.984]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:06:57.204 --> 00:07:03.249]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:10.714]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:15.598]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:28.252]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:34.972]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:35.552 --> 00:07:38.974]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:46.757]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:07:46.877 --> 00:07:47.338]  Thank you.
[00:07:55.157 --> 00:08:01.180]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.861]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:07.763]  Well, we've got David Icke with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:18.308]  He just joined us, former head of the UK Green Party, champion goalie, BBC presenter, best-selling author, and always interesting to get his perspective on things.
[00:08:18.328 --> 00:08:19.648]  I always find it thought-provoking.
[00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.693]  Very apropos of what's happening in our world, we always find his perspective to be enlightening.
[00:08:28.514 --> 00:08:45.304]  David, instead of us getting into generalities or myself getting into long diatribes about my view of what's happening, today I really want to try to sit back, we'll see if I can do it, because you bring up so many points that make me want to chime in, and just throw out questions and get your take on it.
[00:08:46.104 --> 00:08:46.945]  The globalist
[00:08:48.247 --> 00:08:51.435]  ...are overrunning the West with third world populations.
[00:08:52.438 --> 00:08:54.263]  Why are they doing this?
[00:08:55.891 --> 00:09:06.377]  Well, two things we need to know to get a perspective on the world is where this cabal wants to take the world and then the methods they use to take us there.
[00:09:07.177 --> 00:09:25.388]  And where they want to take the world, of course, as we well know, is to a global fascist dictatorship with the end of countries, the end of borders, where basically you just have the world government dictating to massive regional blocs and anything below that is just irrelevant.
[00:09:26.248 --> 00:09:26.428]  I don't
[00:09:42.308 --> 00:10:04.552]  If they have a real sense of country, and I'm not saying that I'm into all this, but a lot of people are, and this is the point from the Cabal's point of view, they will resist giving that power away, say from the United States to the North American Union, in Britain to the European Union, and so the idea is to break down
[00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:13.595]  That sense of culture by basically breaking down the culture and you do that by opening borders to other cultures.
[00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.535]  Now, I'm not saying one culture is better than another.
[00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:32.359]  I'm just trying to explain here what they're doing from their perspective and that you let different cultures pour into the same area and suddenly it becomes a cocktail and there is no single culture anymore that people can identify with and that is all the time
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:46.322]  Loosening and weakening people's sense of need to resist the giving away of sovereignty to unions and to a world government because they've lost the sense of culture that they had before.
[00:10:46.982 --> 00:10:53.543]  This is why what we're talking about here is happening all over the world because of course it's a global agenda.
[00:10:53.884 --> 00:11:02.005]  In Europe the European Union has brought down the borders all over Europe and every time another country comes into the European Union their borders come down and their
[00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:03.546]  We're good to go.
[00:11:20.893 --> 00:11:23.054]  That is something people can identify with.
[00:11:50.612 --> 00:11:51.633]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:51.653 --> 00:11:57.155]  And this is a very, very interesting point, a very important point about playing one off against the other.
[00:11:57.635 --> 00:12:15.923]  You know, the people that pour from the poorer countries into the richer countries through the borders coming down are just as much pawns in this game as those in the countries of the indigenous population that are affected by that.
[00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:16.844]  It's not
[00:12:17.624 --> 00:12:20.086]  Good guys and bad guys we're talking about here.
[00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:26.150]  It's different aspects of the human race being used as pawns in the same game.
[00:12:26.211 --> 00:12:39.540]  This is why, instead of fighting each other, we need to start looking at what unites us all, which is the fact that we're all the target of this cabal, this global fascist dictatorship in the making, in the very first making.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.622]  I mean, we have proof in this country
[00:12:42.407 --> 00:12:43.188]  I don't know.
[00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:11.673]  ...have so much immigration into Britain that it would, this is the quote, change British society forever.
[00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:17.318]  And in that one quote, we have the prime reason for bringing the borders down.
[00:13:17.358 --> 00:13:18.960]  This is what they've done in Europe.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:26.668]  I mean, the government here now, the new government of Cameron, saying, oh, we must slow down immigration into Britain, but they don't say immigration.
[00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:43.964]  They say non-EU immigration because they have absolutely no power whatsoever because of the European Union laws now and the giving away of sovereignty to stop anybody coming in from the European Union into Britain.
[00:13:43.984 --> 00:13:45.785]  And that's exactly the position they want.
[00:13:45.805 --> 00:13:47.487]  They're doing the same in America, of course.
[00:13:48.167 --> 00:14:06.213]  Listeners to this program will well know, and so anyone that challenges this, in America for instance, they're called racist and they're targeted by the federal government, as we're seeing in some states of America have tried to make a stand on this, and it's all orchestrated to break down and destroy
[00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:13.176]  A sense of what is America, of what is Britain, of what is all these countries that are targeted.
[00:14:13.256 --> 00:14:16.097]  And like I say, this is not an attack on what we call immigrants.
[00:14:16.117 --> 00:14:17.118]  It's absolutely not.
[00:14:17.498 --> 00:14:21.860]  Because they are as much pawns in this game as anybody else.
[00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:25.722]  Absolutely.
[00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:26.482]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:31.565]  Whatever the globalists are for, whatever they're really promoting in their councils, we've got to be against.
[00:14:31.885 --> 00:14:36.668]  If they're against disarming us, it doesn't mean there aren't some accidents and problems with having an armed society.
[00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:37.989]  We've still got to be for it.
[00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.232]  If they're trying to socialize health care, you get the legislation.
[00:14:43.152 --> 00:14:46.275]  It's a eugenics takeover, lowering the quality, raising taxes.
[00:14:46.315 --> 00:14:47.215]  We've got to be against it.
[00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:49.117]  They want to launch a new war.
[00:14:49.217 --> 00:14:50.138]  We've got to be against it.
[00:14:50.418 --> 00:14:51.399]  They want open borders.
[00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:52.359]  We've got to be against it.
[00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:53.400]  I mean, it's very simple.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:01.126]  We know these are evil, anti-human, anti-freedom people, and we must stand against everything they stand for.
[00:15:01.347 --> 00:15:08.852]  Now, we can intellectualize and then always go down the road and look at why that's the case, but their interests are not the interest of free humanity.
[00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:10.414]  So it's very elementary for me.
[00:15:11.515 --> 00:15:12.816]  That's a very, very good point.
[00:15:14.697 --> 00:15:15.658]  Let's get it real straight.
[00:15:15.918 --> 00:15:22.562]  These people not only don't care about us, they are antagonistic towards us.
[00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:28.586]  They want to destroy the human race and bring it under the heel of their global fascist dictatorship.
[00:15:28.826 --> 00:15:38.091]  They want to irrevocably change what humans are in our society, the family, everything, to we are just empty biological androids and their words that they program.
[00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:39.832]  This is the end of humanity.
[00:15:40.032 --> 00:15:46.615]  This is the extinction of humanity is their stated goal in every document I've got by their transhumanist futurist.
[00:15:46.856 --> 00:15:49.097]  These are human hating scum.
[00:15:50.752 --> 00:15:51.953]  This is what we're dealing with.
[00:15:52.153 --> 00:15:56.856]  And therefore, as you quite rightly say, if they're for it, then it's bad for the human race.
[00:15:56.876 --> 00:16:02.940]  And we've got to be a bit more kind of streetwise about this and not see everything.
[00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:04.121]  I don't know.
[00:16:24.652 --> 00:16:26.793]  That's at the heart of what's happening now.
[00:16:27.113 --> 00:16:36.915]  The question should be, why do the people who have a deep hatred for humanity, why do they want to disarm the American population?
[00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:39.116]  Now, that's the key thing we ought to be looking at.
[00:16:39.556 --> 00:16:42.657]  We can have these debates about this and immigration.
[00:16:42.697 --> 00:16:46.278]  The question is, why does the cabal want to do it?
[00:16:47.578 --> 00:17:05.472]  And the answer is always because it advances their agenda towards the global fascist dictatorship in which, as you rightly say, it won't just be an economic dictatorship, a political dictatorship, we're talking about a genetic dictatorship where they will not only own our bodies and have
[00:17:07.533 --> 00:17:09.794]  Literally lawful ownership on our bodies.
[00:17:09.834 --> 00:17:10.774]  That's where they're going.
[00:17:11.214 --> 00:17:14.535]  But they will genetically control us and control us through microchips.
[00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:15.675]  That's where they want to go.
[00:17:16.096 --> 00:17:24.258]  And if we're going to get pulled away into diversions of debates about this and debates about that, there's one debate at the moment until we've sorted this.
[00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.619]  Why do they want to do A, B, C and D?
[00:17:27.899 --> 00:17:33.080]  And that's the question we need to keep asking all the time to keep on top of where we're going.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.201]  And we know what they want.
[00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:41.165]  They're so arrogant that they all write white papers on government health care, on the environment movement, on cap-and-trade.
[00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:52.491]  They admit it's to shut down industry, bankrupt everyone, have a huge state that's the only thing that's funded, that literally absorbs humanity, and begins accelerating their soft-kill operations.
[00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:55.313]  We know they've already been introducing poisons into our environment.
[00:17:56.053 --> 00:17:57.335]  And into the vaccines and foods.
[00:17:57.635 --> 00:17:58.136]  We've caught them.
[00:17:58.156 --> 00:18:00.199]  We've got countless documents where they admit they're doing it.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.807]  Now they want to accelerate that up to a hot kill level like we've seen in areas of Africa.
[00:18:06.288 --> 00:18:08.912]  And thank God you're out there exposing these people.
[00:18:09.693 --> 00:18:13.214]  Well, you know, there are people that know there's a conspiracy.
[00:18:13.874 --> 00:18:19.356]  There's people that know that there is a ridiculously few people who are pulling the strings of the world.
[00:18:19.936 --> 00:18:27.859]  But we've still got a long way to go with a lot of people to fully understand the scale of what we're dealing with.
[00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:31.940]  The rabbit hole goes so deep, it's staggering.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.721]  And we're not even
[00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:35.842]  Well, David, I'll say this...
[00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:10.524]  Well, no, I agree with you because I've studied the elite and they believe they're in contact with entities.
[00:19:11.064 --> 00:19:15.087]  I've been to Bohemian Grove, I've covered Skull and Bones, I've read the Pentagon's own writings.
[00:19:15.567 --> 00:19:23.791]  They believe they're being given, every one of them, it says they're channeling things, that they're being directed at the highest levels.
[00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:27.653]  At the mid-levels, it's hedonists, it's satanists, it's people that want money and power.
[00:19:28.013 --> 00:19:30.654]  At the top, these are very focused
[00:19:31.775 --> 00:19:39.180]  People working 18 hours a day and they believe they're working for an entity that I can only describe as the devil.
[00:19:39.981 --> 00:19:41.182]  People can call it whatever they want.
[00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:41.842]  David, stay there.
[00:19:41.862 --> 00:19:48.307]  Let's look at some other contemporary issues and from that window expand and go down the rabbit hole from different angles.
[00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:49.688]  We'll be back with David Icke.
[00:19:49.748 --> 00:19:51.289]  DavidIcke.com is his website.
[00:19:51.309 --> 00:19:53.491]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:56.830]  Remain in your houses.
[00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:02.692]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:20:03.293 --> 00:20:04.273]  Will they do it?
[00:20:04.653 --> 00:20:06.594]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:20:07.274 --> 00:20:13.277]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:20:13.297 --> 00:20:15.038]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:20:15.918 --> 00:20:17.979]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.483]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:29.346]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:20:29.986 --> 00:20:34.869]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:43.874]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:46.456]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.
[00:20:46.656 --> 00:20:49.418]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[00:20:49.718 --> 00:20:52.640]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:20:55.581 --> 00:20:56.622]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:57.042 --> 00:21:02.505]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:03.586]  That's right.
[00:21:03.906 --> 00:21:06.187]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:06.748 --> 00:21:13.672]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:21.914]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:22.354 --> 00:21:27.215]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:27.835 --> 00:21:33.257]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:33.657 --> 00:21:37.778]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:38.158 --> 00:21:38.398]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:38.418 --> 00:21:40.258]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:43.499 --> 00:21:43.780]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.001]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.735 --> 00:21:58.618]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:58.718 --> 00:21:59.479]  What have we got?
[00:21:59.699 --> 00:22:01.820]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:02.901]  A republic.
[00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:05.742]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:05.802 --> 00:22:07.724]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:08.064 --> 00:22:09.985]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:10.105 --> 00:22:11.366]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:11.786 --> 00:22:12.887]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:13.107 --> 00:22:13.507]  Children?
[00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:14.488]  Our education?
[00:22:14.828 --> 00:22:15.448]  Our money?
[00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:19.311]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:23.337]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:23.377 --> 00:22:24.338]  You're being warned.
[00:22:24.639 --> 00:22:25.480]  We have the facts.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.782]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:26.842 --> 00:22:27.703]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:27.743 --> 00:22:28.564]  We have common law.
[00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:30.888]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:31.148 --> 00:22:34.914]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:22:35.014 --> 00:22:39.818]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:22:39.979 --> 00:22:41.360]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.321]  Don't tread on me.
[00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:53.091]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:22:54.452 --> 00:22:57.655]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:58.781]  Think again.
[00:22:59.522 --> 00:23:06.992]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:14.101]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:23:14.401 --> 00:23:22.611]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf Cleanup.
[00:23:22.952 --> 00:23:23.873]  Do what NOAA did.

[00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:00.428]  I was a highway man.
[00:24:01.408 --> 00:24:03.689]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:24:04.069 --> 00:24:05.670]  David Icke is our guest.
[00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:13.154]  So we got into the border issue and how they're overrunning sovereign nations because the globalists want to remake the world in their system.
[00:24:13.714 --> 00:24:16.836]  So any culture, whether it's good or bad, they want it out of the way.
[00:24:17.296 --> 00:24:18.456]  Or the corporate culture.
[00:24:18.476 --> 00:24:19.737]  This is a short segment.
[00:24:19.757 --> 00:24:21.318]  Let's get into the oil spill.
[00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:24.039]  David Icke, the oil spill.
[00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:25.240]  What's your research on that?
[00:24:26.147 --> 00:24:45.028]  Well, the appalling things happening in the Gulf of Mexico now are a classic example of the way the web, the Illuminati web, interfaces with different aspects of itself to create a coordinated policy and a coordinated agenda.
[00:24:45.468 --> 00:24:46.029]  I mean, you've got
[00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:53.297]  Someone, for instance, like Peter D. Sutherland, who was non-executive chairman of BP until a few months ago.
[00:24:53.697 --> 00:24:56.581]  He's also non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
[00:24:56.941 --> 00:24:59.204]  He was the director of the World Trade Organization.
[00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:04.811]  He was the director of, actually, the director general of the World Trade Organization.
[00:25:05.231 --> 00:25:12.720]  He was a director of the Bank of Scotland in the run-up to the period where it crashed in 2008 and had to be bailed out by the taxpayer.
[00:25:13.021 --> 00:25:15.644]  He's been on the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:25:15.664 --> 00:25:17.366]  He's a chairman of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:25:17.726 --> 00:25:19.528]  He's a chairman of the London School of Economics.
[00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:20.389]  I think so.
[00:25:39.532 --> 00:25:48.035]  Non-executive chairman of BP, you had a guy called Lord Brown, who got out before the stuff hit the fan over the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:25:48.716 --> 00:25:58.040]  He was so appalling as chief executive of BP that Tony Blair described him as his favorite businessman, so you can see how bad he was.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:06.303]  And it was Lord Brown who instigated the policy of BP of cutting safety and cutting all
[00:26:07.083 --> 00:26:09.405]  Yeah, they've got more violations in Houston alone.
[00:26:09.445 --> 00:26:20.452]  I saw the number, it's like over a hundred times what other oil companies have combined, and they're the top fake environmentalist company that, with Enron, created the carbon tax scam with Al Gore.
[00:26:20.872 --> 00:26:22.973]  Exactly, and this is how it all interfaces.
[00:26:23.013 --> 00:26:24.634]  This is how the web works.
[00:26:25.095 --> 00:26:27.316]  You see BP, but it's not just BP.
[00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:28.977]  BP's connected to Goldman Sachs.
[00:26:29.017 --> 00:26:31.559]  Goldman Sachs is connected to Halliburton, and so it goes on.
[00:26:32.199 --> 00:26:34.421]  And don't forget Queenie, she owns a big part of it.
[00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:52.919]  Let's go
[00:27:15.379 --> 00:27:15.900]  Yeah, over a third.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.842]  Obama dumped his Vanguard stocks in it.
[00:27:17.862 --> 00:27:18.423]  They all dumped.
[00:27:34.165 --> 00:27:37.846]  So many mysteries kind of fade away when you know the story and what the goal is.
[00:27:37.866 --> 00:27:40.786]  So the next mystery in all this is why do you
[00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:00.770]  We're good to go.
[00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:23.644]  ...offer solutions like the carbon tax and all the rest of it.
[00:28:23.704 --> 00:28:27.388]  Now their climate change scam has been falling apart.
[00:28:27.689 --> 00:28:32.054]  But also there is a war by this cabal against the United States.
[00:28:32.094 --> 00:28:34.617]  They want to destroy the United States militarily.
[00:28:34.998 --> 00:28:35.579]  Destroy it.
[00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:37.040]  I think so.
[00:28:52.009 --> 00:28:56.710]  Now you've got the 10 regions, as the UN says, with the 10 global directors.
[00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.431]  This has been on record since the 60s, which they're now moving towards.
[00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:00.631]  And that's what's so amazing.
[00:29:00.671 --> 00:29:08.973]  They use the US as their henchman, as their funding mechanism, while the US gets all the blame for the global imperial takeover.
[00:29:09.253 --> 00:29:13.134]  And now as they get ready to destroy us, they're moving towards devaluing the dollar.
[00:29:13.454 --> 00:29:16.415]  The IMF, World Bank are criticizing our monetary systems.
[00:29:16.875 --> 00:29:19.236]  The UN is posing as the savior with the global
[00:29:19.696 --> 00:29:20.397]  We're on the march.
[00:29:20.437 --> 00:29:21.778]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.967 --> 00:29:50.728]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.672]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:29:57.472 --> 00:29:58.392]  Tyranny is here.
[00:29:58.733 --> 00:30:02.434]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:02.595 --> 00:30:04.876]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:04.896 --> 00:30:10.339]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:17.002]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:17.422 --> 00:30:22.966]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:23.406 --> 00:30:27.069]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:27.569 --> 00:30:31.552]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:31.872 --> 00:30:37.396]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:37.816 --> 00:30:40.779]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:41.379 --> 00:30:42.800]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:43.781]  It's here.

[00:33:01.966 --> 00:33:18.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, Fox News in New York, we're going to talk to David about this later in the hour, reported that they've got body scanners, car scanners, showed people being forced to drive through x-rays that shoot through cars with gamma rays.
[00:33:18.551 --> 00:33:19.191]  I mean, this makes
[00:33:21.343 --> 00:33:24.326]  This makes chest x-rays look tame in comparison.
[00:33:24.766 --> 00:33:27.048]  Some of the units, the car is driven up, and then it's scanned.
[00:33:27.168 --> 00:33:32.413]  Others, they drive the car through it, and I guess they tell the foolish troops to do it.
[00:33:32.473 --> 00:33:33.174]  Oh, it's okay.
[00:33:33.214 --> 00:33:33.914]  Go ahead and do it.
[00:33:34.315 --> 00:33:38.318]  They're setting the precedent to literally microwave us in front of everyone.
[00:33:39.179 --> 00:33:45.621]  Well, Watson did research, and he's got an amazing article here, New York National Guard involved in mass arrest of U.S.
[00:33:45.661 --> 00:33:46.181]  citizens.
[00:33:46.921 --> 00:33:56.803]  And we got links now to mainstream news in part two, how great it is that the Guard has arrested 2,000 citizens for petty crimes, including gun possession.
[00:33:57.463 --> 00:33:59.024]  I mean, this is martial law.
[00:33:59.944 --> 00:34:02.507]  New York National Guard involved in mass arrest of U.S.
[00:34:02.527 --> 00:34:03.047]  citizens.
[00:34:03.728 --> 00:34:08.153]  Troops assist in over 2,000 arrests last year alone as America sinks in a total martial law.
[00:34:08.593 --> 00:34:15.681]  And the same thing's happening all over the country, and that's why we saw the mayor of Schenectady a few months ago call for martial law in that little sleepy town.
[00:34:16.802 --> 00:34:18.564]  So we're going back to David Eichen a minute.
[00:34:18.644 --> 00:34:22.067]  Don't forget, we have made films like Endgame,
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:32.003]  Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, and of course the Obama Deception that go into who these bankers are, how they're controlling society, and what their plan is.
[00:34:32.143 --> 00:34:34.524]  And this film, Endgame, gets into the extermination plan.
[00:34:34.864 --> 00:34:41.207]  This film is free at Infowars.com when you order it with Invisible Empire or several other of our newest films.
[00:34:41.747 --> 00:34:46.349]  And I'm doing that because Endgame, I believe, is probably my most important film and it's got to be seen quickly.
[00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:51.450]  So InfoWars.com, there's a link at the top of two different shopping carts that have basically the same specials.
[00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:55.932]  We've got a deal where you can get a free ball cap as well up at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:56.252 --> 00:34:58.412]  Or ask about the free deals and combos when you call.
[00:34:58.652 --> 00:35:00.173]  When you buy a DVD, you get a free hat.
[00:35:00.233 --> 00:35:01.633]  Buy some t-shirts, get a free hat.
[00:35:02.113 --> 00:35:04.054]  And your purchase also makes this show possible.
[00:35:05.014 --> 00:35:07.735]  The toll-free number is 888-253-3139.
[00:35:07.755 --> 00:35:10.096]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:11.436 --> 00:35:12.177]  We'll get into this.
[00:35:12.577 --> 00:35:15.158]  Martial law, police state, cyber security.
[00:35:15.438 --> 00:35:18.079]  Now they're admitting censorship of the internet with David in a moment.
[00:35:18.399 --> 00:35:21.400]  But David, segwaying from the oil, where do you think that's going?
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.921]  A. And B. The media has now shifted in Europe, as you know, England and the U.S.
[00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:27.982]  to saying, OK, it is a depression.
[00:35:28.522 --> 00:35:31.465]  After telling us we were in a recovery, now it's a depression.
[00:35:31.725 --> 00:35:36.450]  What do you see unfolding with that leading into a possible strike on Iran?
[00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:43.517]  What do you see from studying the globalist behavior in the past, which is psychopathic and they do it in patterns.
[00:35:43.537 --> 00:35:44.458]  What do you see unfolding?
[00:35:44.878 --> 00:35:53.043]  Well, on the Gulf, they wanted to get as bad as possible so they can exploit it as much as possible with solutions to the problem they've created.
[00:35:53.623 --> 00:35:59.587]  In terms of the economic situation, I've been saying since 2008 that there's a three-point plan here.
[00:36:00.307 --> 00:36:05.070]  One was to crash the economy in 2008 so people could see there was a major problem.
[00:36:05.651 --> 00:36:05.791]  This
[00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:07.450]  I don't think so.
[00:36:28.203 --> 00:36:28.743]  We're good to go.
[00:36:52.912 --> 00:36:57.094]  Nothing like the actual financial state of that bank.
[00:36:57.554 --> 00:37:10.400]  But the second point in this three-stage plan that I was talking about since 2008 was to empty the coffers of governments in terms of reacting to the economic situation.
[00:37:10.881 --> 00:37:12.321]  And we have reached that now.
[00:37:12.381 --> 00:37:13.802]  I mean, what we're having in Britain
[00:37:15.914 --> 00:37:26.120]  But the taxes go up, so a larger percentage of the taxes goes directly to the bankers, who were the ones that created the $600 trillion, conservatively, in fake assets.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.142]  And they won't tell Congress or Parliament where the money went.
[00:37:44.193 --> 00:37:44.553]  Exactly.
[00:37:44.593 --> 00:37:47.736]  The same is happening over here in Europe.
[00:37:48.137 --> 00:38:03.830]  In Britain, during the Brown Labour government that was replaced recently, this amazing transfer of wealth went from taxpayers to the banking system and to the cabal network in general.
[00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:04.651]  And now
[00:38:05.191 --> 00:38:13.941]  Unbelievable levels of cuts in public expenditure are being instigated because they say we're in so much trouble because of the debt.
[00:38:13.981 --> 00:38:15.183]  Now, wait for this, mate.
[00:38:15.363 --> 00:38:19.127]  I talked about earlier about everything connecting to everything else.
[00:38:19.708 --> 00:38:21.190]  The David Cameron government...
[00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:37.880]  That has replaced the Brown Labour government, has appointed someone to oversee where these savage cuts of billions and billions of pounds are going to be made that are going to fundamentally affect the lives of everyone in this country.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.541]  Guess who they've appointed?
[00:38:40.021 --> 00:38:48.746]  Lord Brown, former chief executive of BP, who was responsible for the decisions that led up eventually to the Gulf oil
[00:38:49.607 --> 00:39:02.515]  Well, that's like having all these former Goldman Sachs people running every position in the federal government, getting the bailout money and then giving it to Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
[00:39:02.916 --> 00:39:04.657]  I mean, it is a new level of crime.
[00:39:04.897 --> 00:39:05.878]  And now in the U.S.
[00:39:05.898 --> 00:39:11.782]  under the Federal Reserve expansion in powers, they're being given a new secret office
[00:39:12.242 --> 00:39:16.685]  With unlimited funds to quote take over any area of the economy they wish.
[00:39:16.745 --> 00:39:22.668]  So they're being given dictatorial power right now and the same thing's being done in Greece and everywhere else.
[00:39:22.748 --> 00:39:24.589]  This is their global coup d'etat.
[00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:34.835]  They're going for it all and then that segues into the UN and the IMF announcing we need to start phasing out all the currencies and going to an SDR.
[00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:41.200]  And we need a global government that you pay your carbon taxes to to finance this.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.143]  And who are the biggest investors in carbon credits?
[00:39:44.563 --> 00:39:48.587]  Well, it's Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, BP and a handful of others.
[00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:50.629]  It's always the same inner cabal.
[00:39:51.209 --> 00:40:03.636]  Exactly, and you've got this guy in America who was the great new messiah, Obama, who, if anything, is worse than Bush in that whole period because it's speeding up now.
[00:40:03.676 --> 00:40:06.617]  I mean, this man is not even subtle.
[00:40:06.657 --> 00:40:13.541]  He's just agreeing to everything necessary to allow this to speed up and speed up and speed up.
[00:40:13.581 --> 00:40:14.762]  And I say this to people, you know,
[00:40:15.894 --> 00:40:20.458]  All that's happening now was predicted a long, long time ago.
[00:40:21.099 --> 00:40:35.891]  Not because of people sitting in darkened rooms, smoking something and coming to some conclusions, but from hard research, from documents, from written material saying what these people were planning to do and it's unfolding now.
[00:40:35.991 --> 00:40:38.213]  It wasn't prophecy, it was research.
[00:40:38.553 --> 00:40:39.995]  Now we have to then decide
[00:40:40.755 --> 00:40:42.216]  Where do we draw the line here?
[00:40:43.077 --> 00:40:47.259]  We didn't draw it when it was first pointed out, because, oh, it's just conspiracy theorists.
[00:40:47.539 --> 00:40:48.840]  Well, are we going to draw it now?
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:53.282]  Or are we going to draw it a few months down the road when it's even worse?
[00:40:53.302 --> 00:40:58.626]  A year or two down the road when what's happening today will be nothing compared with then?
[00:40:59.006 --> 00:41:00.266]  When are we going to draw the line?
[00:41:00.507 --> 00:41:09.592]  There's nothing, nothing in anybody's life, I don't care who they are, I don't care where they are, there's nothing more important in anybody's life
[00:41:10.232 --> 00:41:22.207]  I'm focusing on what is going on and we coming together as a population irrespective of race, religion, color, creed, income bracket and saying what are we going to do together to stop this?
[00:41:22.227 --> 00:41:29.155]  Because at the moment we have got a tail, actually at the core, a tiny tail wagging a massive dog.
[00:41:30.536 --> 00:41:39.024]  Unless we start focusing on this and cut out the diversions that are designed to stop us focusing on this, then it's just going to get worse.
[00:41:39.244 --> 00:41:41.226]  But the power is still in our hands.
[00:41:41.626 --> 00:41:47.812]  There are so many of us and so few of those in full knowledge who are actually manipulating us.
[00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:49.053]  Come on, wake up!
[00:41:49.733 --> 00:41:50.474]  Do something!
[00:41:50.494 --> 00:41:53.657]  There's never nothing that we can do.
[00:41:53.917 --> 00:41:54.698]  What can I do?
[00:41:56.617 --> 00:41:57.058]  Sit down!
[00:41:57.078 --> 00:41:58.820]  How can you make a contribution to this?
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.562]  How can you communicate this information?
[00:42:01.282 --> 00:42:11.293]  Even if it's calling into a radio show in the mainstream or something and just saying this is going on, go to this website, go to this radio program, they'll tell you what's going on.
[00:42:11.313 --> 00:42:12.635]  There's nothing but...
[00:42:13.095 --> 00:42:15.376]  There's already a huge awakening happening.
[00:42:15.436 --> 00:42:26.322]  We've got to accelerate it because not only is that little tail wagging this giant dog, they're going to pose with their false solutions to the crisis they created.
[00:42:26.362 --> 00:42:28.443]  That's their methodology, as you know.
[00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:31.705]  Problem, reaction, solution to bring us deeper under their control.
[00:42:32.165 --> 00:42:39.412]  Unless we're there every step of the way going, you're the crooks, you're the social engineers, you're the controllers, you're the one that did this.
[00:42:39.692 --> 00:42:43.416]  How asinine to give the fellow reserve that engineered this even more power.
[00:42:43.636 --> 00:42:47.340]  How asinine to give the Bank of England who engineered this on record more power.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.701]  Look at your connections.
[00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:50.242]  Look at how you're involved in this.
[00:42:50.603 --> 00:42:51.624]  Look at what you've done.
[00:42:51.864 --> 00:42:52.885]  We've got to be there.
[00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:55.968]  That's why they want to shut down the internet, because they're panicked.
[00:42:56.008 --> 00:42:56.888]  Now let's talk about that.
[00:42:57.209 --> 00:43:02.574]  Chinese net style censorship now coming to Australia, coming to New Zealand, coming to Italy, coming to France.
[00:43:02.774 --> 00:43:11.862]  Open announcements in our news that yes, it's going to be more draconian, but to keep you safe, because Al Qaeda is about to shut the internet down, so we've got to have the power to shut it down to save it.
[00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:13.504]  We're going to track everything you do.
[00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.346]  We're going to block what websites you can visit.
[00:43:15.706 --> 00:43:22.653]  Alreadyinfowars.com, prisonplanet.com are already censored on the free broadband in many cities in Europe.
[00:43:22.914 --> 00:43:23.895]  We've confirmed that.
[00:43:24.255 --> 00:43:26.838]  The government here, the FCC, saying they're going to take it over.
[00:43:27.098 --> 00:43:28.860]  Cass Sunstein saying he's going to censor it.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.362]  There's no doubt that line in the sand.
[00:43:32.972 --> 00:43:38.914]  If we don't stand up against tyrants, is whatever we'll put up with, as Thomas Jefferson said, they aren't going to push it to the limit.
[00:43:39.395 --> 00:43:51.119]  And so, again, showing that we have power, David, doesn't that indicate that now they are moving against the web, even though that exposes them, because they realize that there is an accelerated awakening happening?
[00:43:51.639 --> 00:43:59.782]  Well, let me give you an example, just a simple example, which is an example that can be expressed globally.
[00:44:00.882 --> 00:44:18.852]  One of the appalling horrific things that's going on in the world again part of the agenda is for social services and police to steal children from their parents in extraordinary numbers now in America all over the world in Britain on the basis of fake
[00:44:21.093 --> 00:44:30.324]  And it's now mainstream news in England, I mean for those that just tuned in, that they've actually got quotas before a baby's even born and they admit they Trump it up.
[00:44:30.384 --> 00:44:32.206]  These are children snatchers.
[00:44:33.007 --> 00:44:34.368]  They are, they're stealing children.
[00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:46.514]  At least in parts of America, like California, I think it's all over America, there are federal financial incentives for social services to take more and more children from their parents.
[00:44:46.834 --> 00:45:00.320]  But the point I'm making here is that there's a lady named Maureen Spallack in Liverpool in England, and she had her children stolen, three of them, years ago now, and they were given away to foster parents by the social services.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:09.165]  And in the years since, the Liverpool Police and Social Services have run a vendetta against this woman as she tries to get her children back.
[00:45:09.425 --> 00:45:10.726]  She was actually arrested.
[00:45:11.506 --> 00:45:15.608]  Just one example, I could list a number of outrageous things that happened.
[00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:24.093]  She was arrested and taken to court for sending a birthday card to one of the children that the state stole.
[00:45:24.533 --> 00:45:25.974]  The other day, a few days ago,
[00:45:27.192 --> 00:45:31.656]  The Liverpool Police picked her up again for sending a text message to someone.
[00:45:32.337 --> 00:45:36.200]  They put her in jail in Liverpool.
[00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:51.634]  And the reason that the family courts that decide all this are held in secret is not to protect the children, as they claim, it's to protect the system and the Satanists and the pedophiles from stealing the children through social services.
[00:45:52.695 --> 00:45:54.878]  The point I'm leading to, however, is this.
[00:45:54.898 --> 00:46:09.135]  I put on my website, when I heard about this, how gutless, disgusting and pathetic the Liverpool Police were, and a number for Liverpool Police to let people say what they thought about what they were doing to this woman.
[00:46:09.155 --> 00:46:10.296]  She was in custody at the time.
[00:46:12.148 --> 00:46:18.969]  A few hours later they let this lady go and they dropped the charges because their phone system crashed.
[00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:25.071]  So many people rang in to complain of what they were doing to this lady that their whole phone system crashed.
[00:46:25.311 --> 00:46:34.273]  They couldn't keep their child kidnapping going so they said open the phones up we got more kids to grab but it's actually come out in the Telegraph and it's actually come out here in the U.S.
[00:46:34.293 --> 00:46:34.953]  that they have
[00:46:35.753 --> 00:46:50.856]  Quotas on what color hair, eyes, that before a mother has a child they're already planning the fake charges, and it's come out over and over again that so many of the CPS workers are pedophiles because they can get away with everything.
[00:46:51.116 --> 00:46:52.656]  They're pedophiles and they're Satanists.
[00:46:52.716 --> 00:46:56.377]  Not all of them, nothing like all of them, but the people that run the show invariably are.
[00:46:56.597 --> 00:46:58.057]  I've been researching this for decades.
[00:46:58.097 --> 00:47:01.858]  No, I mean, it's in the newspaper every day that they catch top, top CPS workers.
[00:47:02.898 --> 00:47:11.501]  The point is, though, Alex, that when people, the public, phoned this police station in large numbers and said, this is disgusting, we're not having it.
[00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:18.364]  In other words, the secrecy and the shadow level that they do this on was taken away.
[00:47:18.724 --> 00:47:22.045]  This lady was released and the charges were dropped.
[00:47:22.446 --> 00:47:23.826]  We have the power.
[00:47:23.886 --> 00:47:25.727]  They're terrified of the
[00:47:26.547 --> 00:47:28.028]  That's why they're arming against us.
[00:47:28.068 --> 00:47:29.308]  That's why they're surveilling.
[00:47:29.348 --> 00:47:36.271]  That's why they're admitting they're surveilling now, because they know they've committed crimes, they know they're run by crooks, and they are scared.
[00:47:37.051 --> 00:47:42.533]  Yes, but what we have to do is understand our power to change this.
[00:47:43.153 --> 00:47:48.815]  You know, we're talking about a handful of people in full knowledge, manipulating the lives of billions.
[00:47:49.135 --> 00:47:50.716]  What are we doing?
[00:47:50.736 --> 00:47:54.197]  Well, that's why you've written the new book, uh, Mankind Get Off Your Knees.
[00:47:54.517 --> 00:47:56.479]  Yeah, Human Race Get Off Your Knees it's called.
[00:47:56.499 --> 00:48:04.145]  It's just out and the subtitle is The Lion Sleeps No More because within us is a lion.
[00:48:04.185 --> 00:48:14.593]  It is the real human being being suppressed by the human being that has been programmed to think it has no power.
[00:48:14.633 --> 00:48:16.175]  The human being to feel
[00:48:16.735 --> 00:48:17.095]  We're good to go.
[00:48:31.792 --> 00:48:32.032]  Yes.
[00:48:51.203 --> 00:48:55.724]  They've seen all A, that they're putting in the plastic products that does sterilize men.
[00:48:56.084 --> 00:48:58.685]  I mean, the White House science czar admits they're doing this.
[00:48:59.025 --> 00:49:00.425]  You are under attack, too.
[00:49:00.825 --> 00:49:03.186]  And David, you've talked about compartmentalization.
[00:49:03.466 --> 00:49:11.968]  We need to get the police and military to realize, even if they consciously see themselves as on the winning team and part of the New World Order, they're not.
[00:49:12.288 --> 00:49:18.810]  They are seen by the New World Order as an even bigger enemy than the general public in the globalist documents we've gotten.
[00:49:20.299 --> 00:49:31.086]  That's a point I think is very important to stress to those in uniform and to those in the dark suits in government who are serving this system while not actually instigating it.
[00:49:31.106 --> 00:49:31.767]  They're serving it.
[00:49:32.327 --> 00:49:34.228]  You have no power.
[00:49:34.629 --> 00:49:36.930]  I don't care if you're in the military.
[00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:42.274]  I don't care if you've got how many stars on your uniform.
[00:49:42.594 --> 00:49:45.536]  I don't care what level of the police force you're in.
[00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:47.417]  I don't care if you're doing roadblocks.
[00:49:48.598 --> 00:49:50.099]  I'm pulling people off the street.
[00:49:50.159 --> 00:49:51.840]  I don't care what you're doing.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.602]  You have no power.
[00:49:55.082 --> 00:49:57.864]  Your uniform has the power.
[00:49:58.384 --> 00:50:00.305]  Take your uniform off, okay?
[00:50:00.385 --> 00:50:01.446]  Put it in the wardrobe.
[00:50:01.706 --> 00:50:02.606]  Where's your power?
[00:50:02.626 --> 00:50:05.768]  Go and get another job without that uniform.
[00:50:05.788 --> 00:50:06.869]  Where's your power?
[00:50:07.249 --> 00:50:09.230]  You have no power.
[00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:14.714]  You are employed to animate that uniform, which is an extension of the state,
[00:50:15.547 --> 00:50:18.949]  And that's all you are, and therefore you are expendable.
[00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:34.499]  While you give your soul away, while you give your mind away, while you give your morals and decency away, advancing this fascist dictatorship, you will be okay with the fascists that you're serving.
[00:50:34.779 --> 00:50:40.223]  But your children and your grandchildren have to live in the world you are creating.
[00:50:40.883 --> 00:50:41.344]  I think so.
[00:50:56.684 --> 00:50:59.845]  Yeah, you're not going to have to wait now for your kids to be destroyed.
[00:51:21.375 --> 00:51:21.976]  I don't know.
[00:51:36.292 --> 00:51:36.732]  I don't know.
[00:51:57.757 --> 00:52:02.301]  Resistance is victory, and it's understanding the enemy, and it's everybody speaking out.
[00:52:02.321 --> 00:52:14.671]  You know, one little cricket isn't very loud, but you get a field of those, it is a deafening roar, and we're a lot bigger and more powerful than a cricket, and we've all just got to do little things every day,
[00:52:15.271 --> 00:52:32.755]  And realize what's going on and this system will come to a halt and they know that and they are desperate to throw us into a crisis to make themselves matter, to make us beach ourselves on their government, on their corporate structure and so many people within their system are starting to defect.
[00:52:33.175 --> 00:52:39.557]  So many people that have become powerful off their system call me, contact me, talk to me off record, and they say, I wish I would have known this.
[00:52:39.677 --> 00:52:51.681]  I wish I... So many people that even work for the system are compartmentalized, and now through my broadcast, your work, and others, they can finally see the larger paradigm around them from the cog that they filled.
[00:52:52.122 --> 00:52:58.764]  And so by getting that full-spectrum analysis, they can then see the full-spectrum dominance that the globalists have built.
[00:52:59.124 --> 00:53:01.725]  I mean, Rothkopf, who we had on the show who wrote Superclass,
[00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:08.612]  Says there's less than 6,000 people that rule the world and only 20 families that they serve.
[00:53:08.812 --> 00:53:11.014]  So this is now admitted publicly.
[00:53:11.314 --> 00:53:13.597]  And we can defeat these people.
[00:53:13.837 --> 00:53:15.178]  We must defeat these people.
[00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:17.380]  I've got two words to say.
[00:53:17.641 --> 00:53:18.782]  Kindra Arneson.
[00:53:19.494 --> 00:53:34.719]  Who's come out and done so much great work exposing what BP are doing in the Gulf of Mexico and how the whole clean-up stuff is a sham, how the fishermen and other people are being exploited and treated appallingly.
[00:53:35.019 --> 00:53:36.980]  Now they've lost their way of life.
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.760]  They have to serve BP.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.401]  And BP's not sending them checks.
[00:53:42.768 --> 00:53:45.410]  She is a shining light of what can be done.
[00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:49.892]  A few days ago, a week or so ago, she was a mother.
[00:53:50.373 --> 00:53:53.895]  And now, she's standing up to these people and doing a magnificent job.
[00:53:54.215 --> 00:53:55.696]  And anybody can do it.
[00:53:55.776 --> 00:53:56.396]  It's just a matter of time.
[00:53:56.676 --> 00:53:58.958]  And if they arrest her, it's going to backfire.
[00:53:58.998 --> 00:54:01.139]  And if they arrest her, it's going to backfire.
[00:54:01.704 --> 00:54:05.385]  Yeah, of course, and you know, no one said it was going to be easy.
[00:54:05.465 --> 00:54:06.846]  I mean, this is the question.
[00:54:07.406 --> 00:54:15.109]  Are we going to draw the line now, Alex, and take the challenges and sacrifices that that takes to say here and no further?
[00:54:15.129 --> 00:54:24.953]  Or are we going to wait a bit longer until they get more and more control and try to do it then, when this agenda is further down the road than it is now?
[00:54:25.553 --> 00:54:29.114]  Then a bit further, when are we actually going to say enough?
[00:54:29.454 --> 00:54:39.817]  Because it's like that famous phrase by the Christian pastor after Nazi Germany, first they came for the Jews and I was not a Jew so I did nothing.
[00:54:40.137 --> 00:54:42.958]  Then they came for the trade unionists, I was not a trade unionist so I did nothing.
[00:54:43.058 --> 00:54:46.319]  Then they came for the communists, I was not a communist so I did nothing.
[00:54:46.959 --> 00:54:53.241]  This is about all of us, it's not about one group of people, one income bracket, one race, one religion.
[00:54:54.321 --> 00:54:54.541]  No more!
[00:55:22.025 --> 00:55:27.627]  Well, the human race is getting up off its knees and that's why the system is howling with anger.
[00:55:28.887 --> 00:55:33.669]  Let's get into the police state and the minutes we've got left, David, and I want to hold you five over if you can do it.
[00:55:33.689 --> 00:55:34.509]  Okay.
[00:55:34.629 --> 00:55:39.571]  But, I mean, the police state, it's even shocking me how fast they're moving.
[00:55:39.611 --> 00:55:43.032]  We have now discovered just today, this is unbelievably important news,
[00:55:43.652 --> 00:55:53.778]  That all over the country, not just New York, but Illinois, you name it, the military, Marines, Army, National Guard are arresting citizens nationwide with police.
[00:55:54.178 --> 00:55:57.320]  And this has been going on for several years and I wasn't even aware.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.921]  Now they're putting it out on TV like it's a good thing.
[00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:03.603]  I mean, again, I didn't even know the magnitude, David.
[00:56:03.643 --> 00:56:04.504]  This is incredible.
[00:56:05.484 --> 00:56:16.820]  Yeah, and it is what I call over the years the totalitarian tiptoe, where you're at A and you know you're going to Z, but if you go in too big a leap, then people look up and say, what's going on?
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:21.947]  Because the change in your society is so blatantly obvious.
[00:56:22.407 --> 00:56:24.009]  So they do it in steps.
[00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:28.913]  But of course, the nearer they get to the goal, the steps get quicker and quicker because it's a simple equation.
[00:56:29.393 --> 00:56:33.777]  The more you centralize power, the more power you then have to centralize even quicker.
[00:56:33.837 --> 00:56:39.862]  And that's why the momentum of centralization and dictatorship gets faster and faster.
[00:56:40.443 --> 00:56:42.865]  Because the more power you have, the quicker you can push it on.
[00:56:43.165 --> 00:56:45.347]  The more power you have, the quicker you can push it on.
[00:56:45.707 --> 00:56:47.829]  And this is why we've reached the point now where they've
[00:56:50.027 --> 00:57:13.235]  And they use every new crisis as a way to say, no media, no local officials, no one's allowed, you're not getting your checks for the fishing we've shut down, you're not allowed to have a gun, you're not allowed to protect yourself, and we're like, where's the law?
[00:57:13.275 --> 00:57:14.856]  And they said, we don't need any stinking law.
[00:57:15.976 --> 00:57:24.023]  Yeah, what they've done in a series of steps, getting faster and faster, is take away the checks and balances, the checks and balances, the checks and balances.
[00:57:24.304 --> 00:57:34.433]  They did it most blatantly with the checks and balances they took away to stop the free-for-all in the financial markets, the financial industry, and look what that led to.
[00:57:34.913 --> 00:57:49.329]  And every single time one of these checks and balances has been suggested to be taken away, every time the people that could have stood up to that and thought, well, you know, I'm not even, can't be bothered all this, I have no power to do that, what can I do?
[00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:52.413]  Then they have played a part in where we've reached now.
[00:57:52.873 --> 00:57:54.535]  So can we learn from that, please?
[00:57:55.823 --> 00:58:00.988]  Say, OK, we've made mistakes in the past when we didn't stand up to what we should have stood up to.
[00:58:01.368 --> 00:58:04.791]  And so we better learn from those mistakes now and start standing up here.
[00:58:05.032 --> 00:58:08.315]  Because if we don't, then it's going to be a lot more difficult down the road.
[00:58:10.523 --> 00:58:11.683]  David Icke is our guest.
[00:58:11.723 --> 00:58:19.986]  We're going to do five more minutes with him, and then Sheriff Richard Mack's coming on, and I've got a few other key quick questions for David, but the time with him has sure gone fast.
[00:58:20.006 --> 00:58:23.807]  The new book is, of course, available at DavidIcke.com.
[00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:31.509]  Our books, videos, materials are all available at InfoWars.com, and supporting the type of work we're doing is so vital.
[00:58:31.529 --> 00:58:32.889]  You don't need to be told that, do you?
[00:58:36.651 --> 00:58:37.991]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:46.354 --> 00:59:48.259]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.507]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:03.403]  All right, we're in the final hour.
[01:00:03.563 --> 01:00:09.229]  We've got Sheriff Richard Mack coming up after this break, but David Icke is our guest for another five minutes.
[01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:11.991]  During the break I said, what do you think is most important to finish off with?
[01:00:12.031 --> 01:00:13.933]  And he said, Albert Pike's letter.
[01:00:14.434 --> 01:00:17.076]  And I've read his book, Morals and Dogma.
[01:00:17.657 --> 01:00:21.200]  Of course, this letter is reported to be at the British Naval Museum.
[01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:24.043]  He was a Confederate general, the founder of the Klan.
[01:00:25.066 --> 01:00:27.286]  A British agent trying to break up the U.S.
[01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:30.007]  with the Civil War, and all of that's been confirmed.
[01:00:30.287 --> 01:00:33.268]  But this letter is just amazing, the way it predicted everything they've done.
[01:00:33.468 --> 01:00:36.468]  So go over some of that letter, the three phases, in the last five minutes, David.
[01:00:36.488 --> 01:00:36.768]  Go ahead.
[01:00:37.248 --> 01:00:44.910]  Well, Albert Pike, who of course was a massive, massive Freemason, an absolute Freemasonic god.
[01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:50.571]  Of course, his statue is in Washington, D.C., right next to Washington, D.C.
[01:00:50.671 --> 01:00:53.372]  police headquarters, which is quite appropriate, I would say.
[01:00:53.412 --> 01:00:54.512]  We're dealing with Freemasonry.
[01:00:55.072 --> 01:01:05.737]  And it's alleged that he wrote this letter to a guy called Mazzini, a very infamous Illuminati operative, and he predicted in this letter three world wars that were coming.
[01:01:05.757 --> 01:01:09.299]  It was alleged to have been sent or written in 1871.
[01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:22.307]  And the First World War, he talks about the overthrow of the Tsars in Russia and making the country a fortress of atheist communism, etc.
[01:01:22.727 --> 01:01:28.229]  He talks about bringing the British and Germanic empires into the war.
[01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:39.578]  The Second World War must be fermented by taking advantage of the differences between the fascists and the political Zionists, and talks about things that happened then.
[01:01:39.618 --> 01:01:48.105]  But the point that it leads to is the Third World War, which really, I mean, I've been saying for years that's the plan, which it is.
[01:01:48.346 --> 01:01:55.672]  And the description in the letter of the Third World War is absolutely describing the period we're going through now.
[01:01:56.192 --> 01:01:56.753]  He says this.
[01:01:57.646 --> 01:02:08.371]  The Third World War must be fermented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the agenteur of the Illuminati between the political Zionists and the leaders of the Islamic world.
[01:02:08.832 --> 01:02:16.475]  The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam, the Muslim-Arabic world, and political Zionism, the State of Israel, mutually destroy each other.
[01:02:17.076 --> 01:02:25.180]  Meanwhile, the other nations, once more divided on this issue, will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual, and economic exhaustion.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.264]  We shall unleash the nihilists and atheists.
[01:02:28.585 --> 01:02:39.441]  We shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm, which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil.
[01:02:40.002 --> 01:02:41.384]  Then everywhere the citizens
[01:02:41.844 --> 01:02:42.744]  Thanks for watching!
[01:02:59.589 --> 01:03:06.533]  ...will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out into the public view.
[01:03:06.553 --> 01:03:14.897]  This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement, which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.
[01:03:15.237 --> 01:03:24.182]  And he talks about the fact that they're going to make, in effect, the global society so full of turmoil, so full of upheaval,
[01:03:24.682 --> 01:03:30.284]  That the people will turn to the few, the cabal, and say, save us from it.
[01:03:30.344 --> 01:03:34.025]  And the cabal will then say, well, to do that, we must do this.
[01:03:34.266 --> 01:03:41.208]  And we know in 1919, these are confirmed, Lord Milner repeated it about creating a Germanic super state to start a new war.
[01:03:41.508 --> 01:03:44.049]  And we know they used World War I for the League of Nations.
[01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:47.470]  We have the Carnegie documents about World War II being engineered.
[01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:49.011]  I mean, this is real.
[01:03:49.611 --> 01:04:01.019]  Yeah, I mean, Milner was the head of a secret society in London called the Round Table, which spawned the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:05.342]  It spawned, of course, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group eventually.
[01:04:05.922 --> 01:04:07.724]  And David, we're almost out of time.
[01:04:07.964 --> 01:04:09.345]  Do you agree?
[01:04:09.485 --> 01:04:15.289]  House of Rothschild is at the absolute center of this in the human world, if you like.
[01:04:16.431 --> 01:04:17.471]  And David, we're almost out of time.
[01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:19.552]  You've agreed to come back on sooner rather than later.
[01:04:19.592 --> 01:04:22.152]  I'd like to get you on the next month because a quickening is happening.
[01:04:22.172 --> 01:04:25.873]  But do you agree, briefly, we are on the cusp of what could be World War III?
[01:04:25.893 --> 01:04:27.654]  They are pushing us in that direction.
[01:04:27.914 --> 01:04:28.534]  Oh, exactly.
[01:04:28.554 --> 01:04:30.854]  That's always been the plan.
[01:04:30.874 --> 01:04:35.816]  Three world wars to change the world to a global fascist dictatorship.
[01:04:36.116 --> 01:04:38.376]  We do not have to play their game.
[01:04:38.476 --> 01:04:40.297]  It's time to say no.
[01:04:40.697 --> 01:04:41.057]  No more.
[01:04:41.437 --> 01:04:42.380]  David, amazing.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.924]  I look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[01:04:43.944 --> 01:04:45.207]  Let me say bye to you during this break.
[01:04:45.468 --> 01:04:48.616]  Sheriff Richard Mack with solutions on taking back our county.
[01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:49.198]  Straight ahead.
[01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:49.639]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.353 --> 01:04:57.596]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:04:57.916 --> 01:04:58.517]  Number 1.
[01:04:58.817 --> 01:05:01.979]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:02.800]  Number 2.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.664]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:08.444]  It's true.
[01:05:08.744 --> 01:05:13.308]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:13.608 --> 01:05:14.148]  Number 3.
[01:05:14.449 --> 01:05:17.731]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:18.031 --> 01:05:21.734]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:21.934 --> 01:05:22.475]  Number 4.
[01:05:22.715 --> 01:05:25.078]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:25.478 --> 01:05:28.862]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:29.162 --> 01:05:29.382]  Number 5.
[01:05:29.963 --> 01:05:33.887]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:34.108 --> 01:05:38.873]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:05:54.892 --> 01:05:57.715]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:16.911]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:06:17.231 --> 01:06:23.437]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:06:23.758 --> 01:06:25.159]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:45.820]  Thank you!
[01:06:52.912 --> 01:06:55.235]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:57.518]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:06:57.619 --> 01:07:00.402]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:07:00.843 --> 01:07:05.589]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:10.136]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:07:10.436 --> 01:07:12.777]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:07:12.797 --> 01:07:15.319]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:07:15.339 --> 01:07:18.260]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:26.185]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:07:26.539 --> 01:07:31.784]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:07:31.924 --> 01:07:34.207]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:07:34.247 --> 01:07:38.210]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:39.392]  And I got news for you.
[01:07:39.532 --> 01:07:40.833]  You're everyone else.
[01:07:40.873 --> 01:07:41.994]  Invisible Empire.

[01:07:54.249 --> 01:07:56.432]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:57.012 --> 01:07:59.796]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.492 --> 01:08:30.154]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:33.056]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:08:33.437 --> 01:08:40.902]  And we've got here in the final 52 minutes of this radio broadcast, we have Sheriff Richard Mack, author, speaker, former sheriff.
[01:08:41.303 --> 01:08:48.408]  Richard Mack has served in a wide variety of roles over the course of his nearly 20-year career in law enforcement, which began in Provo, Utah.
[01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:51.391]  Mack began his career with the Provo Police Department.
[01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:53.813]  And of course he then became a sheriff.
[01:08:54.713 --> 01:09:00.959]  And he, of course, was involved in a famous Supreme Court case defending the Second Amendment.
[01:09:01.379 --> 01:09:07.424]  And now he's traveling all over the country in high demand, educating people about the 10th.
[01:09:08.522 --> 01:09:08.882]  I don't
[01:09:31.485 --> 01:09:33.026]  And so this is completely backwards.
[01:09:33.046 --> 01:09:42.474]  It's just like globalists have come into Austin and they have financed Austin raising a $2.6 billion tax, doubling our energy cost in the next three years.
[01:09:42.734 --> 01:09:45.757]  They're seizing Mopac to put toll roads on it, admittedly illegal.
[01:09:45.777 --> 01:09:46.958]  It's an existing road.
[01:09:47.778 --> 01:09:48.719]  But they don't care.
[01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:52.522]  I mean, because the cities aren't following the 10th Amendment.
[01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:55.885]  They have been taken over just like the federal government's been taken over.
[01:09:56.305 --> 01:09:59.028]  So we've got to head them off at the pass, taking our counties,
[01:09:59.648 --> 01:10:00.588]  And our state's back.
[01:10:00.888 --> 01:10:06.770]  So it's not just 10th Amendment nullification of unconstitutional federal laws and taxes that's moving forward.
[01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:10.491]  And you're seeing that, of course, with Arizona saying they're going to defend the border down there.
[01:10:11.212 --> 01:10:15.473]  But it's expanding to now the county sheriffs as well.
[01:10:15.533 --> 01:10:18.754]  And for over a decade, Sheriff Richard Mack has been exposing this.
[01:10:18.774 --> 01:10:20.594]  He also has a book on the subject.
[01:10:21.135 --> 01:10:27.897]  But Sheriff, before we go any further and get into that, talk about the State of the Second Amendment and for folks that aren't aware of it.
[01:10:29.077 --> 01:10:35.442]  Your Supreme Court case and your take on what the Supreme Court ruled on a few weeks ago.
[01:10:36.804 --> 01:10:37.644]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:10:38.345 --> 01:10:39.246]  Well, thanks Alex.
[01:10:39.346 --> 01:10:43.249]  It's always great to be with you and I appreciate you giving me some time today.
[01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:45.811]  Yes, I am really busy.
[01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:50.355]  I'll be in Fresno this weekend and on Monday I go to Amarillo.
[01:10:51.472 --> 01:11:04.820]  Uh, and we're gonna have, uh, several, uh, sheriffs there, and I'm teaching my, uh, uh, constitution class for peace officers there, uh, to public and, uh, peace officers alike, and I'm doing that all across the country.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:13.343]  And I really do feel that the title of my book, The County Sheriff, America's Last Hope, really basically tells it all.
[01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:15.564]  That's a state sovereignty issue.
[01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:19.946]  Arizona is now exemplifying the power of state sovereignty.
[01:11:19.966 --> 01:11:22.528]  It is the only answer left.
[01:11:23.068 --> 01:11:27.430]  I don't see any other recourse for the states or for personal freedom.
[01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:33.754]  Other than states standing against the incursions of the federal government.
[01:11:33.794 --> 01:11:40.138]  Sheriff, I want to get to that in a moment, but I want to go back first to your history for folks who may not know who you are.
[01:11:40.158 --> 01:11:42.499]  We're in a lot of new stations since you were last on with us.
[01:11:42.519 --> 01:11:48.623]  Kind of talk about your awakening so other officers can basically see it from that perspective.
[01:11:49.283 --> 01:11:53.546]  And then let's get into your Supreme Court case and where you see the Second Amendment being.
[01:11:53.566 --> 01:11:56.728]  Then we'll spend the rest of the hour on the states' rights movement.
[01:11:57.168 --> 01:11:58.429]  All right, well, fantastic.
[01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:17.327]  Well, when I was elected sheriff here in Southern Arizona, it was at Graham County back in 1988, then I was re-elected in 1992, and then the Brady Bill came out in 19... well, it was signed into law by Bill Clinton at the end of 1993, and it went into effect February of 1994.
[01:12:19.289 --> 01:12:22.812]  And the key part of that whole thing is, is that
[01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:35.355]  There was a component within the Brady Bill that required local officials, and it was in most cases the sheriff, to conduct background checks on citizens before they could buy a gun.
[01:12:35.776 --> 01:12:39.997]  So, we're being forced under a threat of arrest.
[01:12:40.318 --> 01:12:47.341]  There was no money attached to this, Alex, as you'll recall, but there was a threat of arrest if we failed to comply.
[01:12:48.021 --> 01:12:49.562]  So this is the first time in U.S.
[01:12:49.602 --> 01:12:52.063]  history that the United States Congress
[01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:58.533]  ...wish to compel and commandeer the Office of Sheriffs for federal bidding.
[01:12:59.113 --> 01:13:01.354]  So this is the picture, this is the perspective.
[01:13:02.055 --> 01:13:15.241]  Local officials elected by, for, and of the people to serve their needs and to serve their constitutional rights are now being dragooned, as one of the judges called it,
[01:13:16.027 --> 01:13:25.075]  We're now being dragooned into federal service and forced to violate our oath of office and to violate the rights of our citizens to keep and bear arms.
[01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:29.158]  And if we don't do it, they threaten to arrest us.
[01:13:29.383 --> 01:13:31.304]  You're being pressed into service.
[01:13:31.745 --> 01:13:39.571]  You're being literally shanghaied, enslaved, drug on to the Federal Reservation with an unconstitutional law.
[01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:42.713]  Thank God it's, you know, to some extent been thrown out.
[01:13:42.733 --> 01:13:43.433]  Right.
[01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:45.655]  But still there, you know, some remnants.
[01:13:46.315 --> 01:13:49.818]  I mean, this is amazing that this is going on and it's an unfunded mandate.
[01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:52.020]  It's literally indentured servitude.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.842]  I mean, there's so many issues here continue.
[01:13:55.731 --> 01:14:05.516]  Well, and it's funny that you mention indentured servitude, because I actually filed on the 13th Amendment, which was, you know, just what you said.
[01:14:05.536 --> 01:14:06.696]  Unlawful servitude.
[01:14:08.593 --> 01:14:08.833]  Yes.
[01:14:08.853 --> 01:14:10.314]  That's the whole point of the states!
[01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:33.091]  Well, exactly.
[01:14:33.151 --> 01:14:40.510]  And if we allow the feds to tell us what size toilet we can have and what our kids can eat and what the sheriff can do, I mean, why even have states?
[01:14:41.098 --> 01:14:41.618]  Exactly.
[01:14:41.698 --> 01:14:43.098]  That's a key point.
[01:14:43.839 --> 01:14:47.740]  And so now the states can't even control their own land or their own resources.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:53.161]  In fact, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah are all about 85% owned by the federal government.
[01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:57.802]  My county of Graham County, Arizona is 95% owned by the federal government.
[01:14:58.222 --> 01:15:01.643]  I wonder when we're going to wake up and say, you know, this isn't Arizona.
[01:15:01.683 --> 01:15:04.644]  We're federal enclave number 48 because we were the 48th state.
[01:15:07.521 --> 01:15:11.763]  It's time that the governors of every state tell the federal government to get out.
[01:15:11.903 --> 01:15:13.024]  And my case can prove it.
[01:15:13.064 --> 01:15:17.766]  Now, what I did is I said, look, I'm not going to go along.
[01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:25.290]  There's no way that I'm going to violate my oath for the federal government, for the Clinton administration, for this stupid thing called the Brady Bill.
[01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:31.373]  And so I was the first sheriff in the United States to file a lawsuit against my own government.
[01:15:32.274 --> 01:15:35.336]  And the decision was just between me and my wife and the Lord.
[01:15:35.636 --> 01:15:36.616]  That was all it was.
[01:15:37.216 --> 01:15:42.279]  And the next day, the historical perspective of this is that I called the NRA.
[01:15:42.339 --> 01:15:43.880]  I had no place else to go.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.180]  I wasn't a member of anything.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.901]  I wasn't a member of the NRA.
[01:15:46.921 --> 01:15:47.821]  I'm still not today.
[01:15:48.362 --> 01:15:50.863]  But I called them and I said, what can I do to stop this?
[01:15:51.463 --> 01:15:57.205]  And they said, uh, we've already been working on this case and we needed a sheriff to call so we could have standing.
[01:15:57.665 --> 01:15:59.325]  And I said, well, uh, let's do it.
[01:15:59.465 --> 01:16:00.786]  I want my own lawyer though.
[01:16:00.826 --> 01:16:06.047]  And they recommended a lawyer for me that I hired personally out here in Arizona by the name of Dave Hardy.
[01:16:06.507 --> 01:16:07.988]  He worked with the NRA lawyers.
[01:16:08.688 --> 01:16:12.589]  And we got this thing filed the very day the Brady Bill took effect on February 28, 1994.
[01:16:12.689 --> 01:16:20.411]  Then some other sheriffs joined the case, and there was only five or six that came in.
[01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:26.032]  Sheriff Prince from Montana and I ended up at the United States Supreme Court in December of 1996, and on June 27, 1997,
[01:16:30.248 --> 01:16:40.542]  The United States Supreme Court ruled that the Brady Bill was indeed unconstitutional, that the federal government cannot tell the states what to do, that they cannot, and this is in the ruling itself,
[01:16:41.654 --> 01:16:45.176]  Let me tell you what this is.
[01:16:45.296 --> 01:16:49.257]  So they indentured the gun dealers instead, and it should be thrown out on that.
[01:16:49.317 --> 01:16:52.958]  But the point is, you took action, you sued, you got involved.
[01:16:53.159 --> 01:16:54.739]  Americans want to know what solutions are.
[01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:57.620]  Everybody just starts standing up to the feds.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.041]  We'll win, lose, we'll draw.
[01:16:59.361 --> 01:17:01.182]  But we know if we lay down, we're going to lose.
[01:17:01.402 --> 01:17:01.742]  Go ahead.
[01:17:02.302 --> 01:17:02.963]  Well, that's right.
[01:17:03.183 --> 01:17:04.544]  And listen to this.
[01:17:04.664 --> 01:17:16.215]  I mean, this was so well hidden from the public, and Bill Clinton made the media go along with him in making sure that the citizens of this country never heard what this decision really did.
[01:17:16.795 --> 01:17:17.956]  Now, listen to this.
[01:17:17.976 --> 01:17:19.538]  This is the order of the court.
[01:17:20.418 --> 01:17:27.585]  The federal government may neither issue directives requiring the states even to address particular problems
[01:17:28.288 --> 01:17:44.075]  Nor command the state's officers or those of their political subdivisions, and you just addressed what those are, cities and counties, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.
[01:17:46.098 --> 01:17:52.082]  Such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty.
[01:17:52.342 --> 01:17:53.363]  And what does that say?
[01:17:53.383 --> 01:17:55.925]  That's a Supreme Court ruling that you never hear about.
[01:17:56.165 --> 01:17:57.646]  What does that say for cap-and-trade?
[01:17:57.926 --> 01:18:07.532]  What does that say with the feds showing up on shore in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, now Texas, telling county commissioners and sheriffs they can't be on the beach?
[01:18:07.832 --> 01:18:09.954]  Some little BP goon.
[01:18:09.974 --> 01:18:12.175]  I mean, that's why this stuff's important.
[01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:14.998]  I mean, that's what the 11th Amendment says.
[01:18:15.658 --> 01:18:18.621]  You have foreign powers coming by off Presidents and Congress.
[01:18:18.901 --> 01:18:21.704]  We've got to have state rights so they can't have BP.
[01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:22.665]  I mean, what's next?
[01:18:22.745 --> 01:18:24.467]  Is BP going to tell us to move out of our house?
[01:18:24.487 --> 01:18:25.308]  They're going to move in?
[01:18:25.788 --> 01:18:27.710]  Next, do we have to give our daughters to BP?
[01:18:28.131 --> 01:18:31.094]  Like Prima Nocte 600 years ago in England?
[01:18:31.574 --> 01:18:37.716]  Yeah, Prima Nocte was, uh, yeah, you're starting to wonder because they're sure raping our land all the time.
[01:18:38.316 --> 01:18:43.978]  Now, it also says a lot about nationalized socialistic healthcare, Alex, as you well know.
[01:18:44.599 --> 01:18:53.582]  Because if the states cannot be forced to participate in a federal regulatory program, then we have 30 states suing right now that don't need to sue at all.
[01:18:54.002 --> 01:18:59.384]  All they need to do is ask for summary judgment based on our case.
[01:19:00.349 --> 01:19:08.552]  This case already proves that nationalized, socialistic healthcare is unconstitutional and the states do not have to go along.
[01:19:08.892 --> 01:19:12.013]  But the Romans knew that roads were key to controlling areas.
[01:19:12.513 --> 01:19:16.234]  That's why all roads led to Rome in the old world 2,000 plus years ago.
[01:19:17.214 --> 01:19:20.635]  That's why they brought in NAFTA superhighways and the federal highways.
[01:19:20.975 --> 01:19:23.756]  Now they can tax and control those and control the communities.
[01:19:24.056 --> 01:19:26.317]  They take our tax money, send it to Washington,
[01:19:26.877 --> 01:19:28.018]  Then build the roads.
[01:19:28.478 --> 01:19:29.058]  It's incredible.
[01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.119]  Sheriff Mack, amazing.
[01:19:30.139 --> 01:19:38.424]  That's why I wanted to go over that key Supreme Court ruling that you got to show the power of the individual, the power of the ruling, and to illustrate the Tenth Amendment.
[01:19:38.785 --> 01:19:50.052]  Now we're going to come back and talk about state powers with the borders and everything else, and not just to take over the legislatures, that's our right and duty, but the Sheriff's Department, straight ahead with an American hero, Richard Mack.
[01:19:54.049 --> 01:19:56.351]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:19:56.431 --> 01:19:58.613]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:19:58.633 --> 01:20:01.536]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:20:01.956 --> 01:20:06.721]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:20:07.081 --> 01:20:11.265]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:20:11.565 --> 01:20:13.909]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:20:13.929 --> 01:20:16.453]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:19.377]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:20:19.717 --> 01:20:27.329]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:20:27.649 --> 01:20:32.931]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:20:33.051 --> 01:20:35.312]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:20:35.352 --> 01:20:39.333]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:20:39.573 --> 01:20:40.474]  And I got news for you.
[01:20:40.494 --> 01:20:41.934]  You're everyone else.
[01:20:41.994 --> 01:20:43.015]  Invisible Empire.

[01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:56.117]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:20:56.357 --> 01:21:00.319]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:21:00.519 --> 01:21:02.580]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:21:02.781 --> 01:21:07.803]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:21:07.943 --> 01:21:09.704]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:11.105]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:21:11.305 --> 01:21:12.765]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:21:12.805 --> 01:21:15.847]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:21:16.167 --> 01:21:21.188]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:30.650]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights and measures.

[01:21:33.231 --> 01:21:34.931]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[01:21:39.292 --> 01:21:40.033]  Afraid to answer it?
[01:21:59.562 --> 01:22:00.023]  I don't know.
[01:22:17.039 --> 01:22:17.259]  I think so.

[01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:54.630]  This is important.
[01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:55.571]  Alex Jones here.

[01:24:20.416 --> 01:24:25.218]  Sheriff Richard Mack is our guest on the end of the transmission, coming up here in about 35 minutes.
[01:24:26.078 --> 01:24:30.780]  Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic is a new documentary film with R.J.
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:36.742]  Harris, Michael Bachnerik, Alex Jones, Richard Mack, Edwin Vieira, Cynthia Davis, Charles Key, and many others.
[01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:40.924]  This film is so important because it really
[01:24:41.864 --> 01:25:01.202]  Supercharges the tea parties and libertarian groups and pro-america organizations that want to save our country from globalism by illustrating the 9th and 10th Amendment, by illustrating the power of the sheriff, by illustrating the power of the state legislature, and how it's our right and duty to stand up for this nation.
[01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:05.226]  The fact that the feds are doing this is treason by every measurement.
[01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:08.253]  And so that is available at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:08.293 --> 01:25:09.776]  Also the new film, The Secret of Oz.
[01:25:10.298 --> 01:25:11.601]  Solutions for a Broken Economy.
[01:25:11.641 --> 01:25:14.849]  Amazing film by the maker of the Money Masters, Bill Still.
[01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:17.702]  This has got a lot of great solutions as well.
[01:25:36.016 --> 01:25:36.937]  Yeah, it is that.
[01:25:37.037 --> 01:25:39.418]  And like I say, I think it's our only hope left.
[01:25:39.438 --> 01:25:43.160]  Now, I'm reading from a little pocket-sized brief of the case.
[01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:05.158]  And if anybody would like to get that, it's called the Victory for State Sovereignty, the Mack Prince vs. USA case.
[01:26:06.019 --> 01:26:10.662]  And it's available at my website, and it's sheriffmack.com.
[01:26:11.102 --> 01:26:17.206]  You can also get the book, The County Sheriff, America's Last Hope, which everyone should have a copy of both of these.
[01:26:17.587 --> 01:26:25.272]  This little booklet that I have in my hand that I'm reviewing with you right now regarding this case, the most powerful
[01:26:26.161 --> 01:26:29.362]  And monumental 10th Amendment decision in the history of our country.
[01:26:29.682 --> 01:26:31.262]  This was all about states' rights.
[01:26:31.382 --> 01:26:34.883]  It talks about the EPA being unconstitutional.
[01:26:35.283 --> 01:26:39.644]  It talks about the states not being puppets of the ventriloquist Congress.
[01:26:40.244 --> 01:26:41.985]  It talks about the supremacy clause.
[01:26:42.385 --> 01:26:44.745]  And that is a key component of this whole thing.
[01:26:45.145 --> 01:26:48.346]  Because Barack Obama is saying he wants to sue Arizona.
[01:26:49.206 --> 01:26:50.527]  On the Supremacy Clause.
[01:26:50.887 --> 01:26:57.329]  Well, Justice Scalia already says that the Supremacy Clause does not give the federal government supremacy.
[01:26:58.029 --> 01:27:03.571]  It says that the Constitution is supreme, not the federal government, and that's a huge difference.
[01:27:04.171 --> 01:27:14.934]  And one of the key components of this case is that the decision is based on this, and Justice Scalia, who wrote the decision, says this over and over in the decision, and I quote,
[01:27:15.646 --> 01:27:21.008]  State legislatures are not subject to federal direction, end quote.
[01:27:21.648 --> 01:27:42.856]  So if we are not subject to federal direction, and if we indeed, as this case says, if the states are indeed sovereign, then that means that the federal government is not our boss, they cannot tell us what to do, they cannot issue directives to the states, they cannot control our land, our water, our education, our healthcare,
[01:27:43.876 --> 01:27:46.738]  Or anything else that they're trying to shove down our throats.
[01:27:47.298 --> 01:27:49.919]  So where do we go to make sure that we know and understand this?
[01:27:50.259 --> 01:27:51.460]  The same place I went.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.702]  Now Alex, you mentioned I was a rookie cop in Provo, Utah.
[01:27:55.202 --> 01:27:57.383]  When I was there, I made a huge mistake.
[01:27:58.183 --> 01:27:59.884]  I actually read the Constitution.
[01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:03.786]  I took my oath of office after that very seriously.
[01:28:03.806 --> 01:28:05.047]  I dedicated
[01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:06.692]  Are you there?
[01:28:06.912 --> 01:28:07.352]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:07.573 --> 01:28:07.993]  Okay, good.
[01:28:08.053 --> 01:28:09.055]  I thought my phone went dead.
[01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:09.956]  No, I didn't hear a click.
[01:28:10.016 --> 01:28:10.376]  Go ahead.
[01:28:10.397 --> 01:28:10.817]  Okay, good.
[01:28:11.238 --> 01:28:20.790]  But I made a commitment to myself that I would never go against the Constitution, that I would uphold and defend the Constitution, just like I promised to do.
[01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:48.406]  And if we wake up local officials to that principle, that they'll keep their word when they swear an oath, an oath that is required by Article 6 of our own Constitution, that the Founding Fathers put in there, that all state and local officials would be required to swear allegiance, not to the King, not to the President, not to some bureaucracy, not to the Governor, but to the people,
[01:28:49.139 --> 01:29:12.248]  That we promised that we would uphold and defend their constitutional rights, and if we had everybody in local government doing just that, if every sheriff, in fact if we only had three or four or five hundred of the three thousand sheriffs in this country actually keeping their oath and defending the constitution against all enemies both foreign and domestic, if we actually had that Alex,
[01:29:13.024 --> 01:29:14.585]  We would get our freedom back tomorrow.
[01:29:14.705 --> 01:29:24.290]  Oh, it would paralyze the New World Order, and that's why they're demonizing you, that's why they're so scared, and that's why everybody's got to go to your website and get your book and give it to their sheriff.
[01:29:24.630 --> 01:29:26.711]  Some sheriffs won't read a book, but they need to.
[01:29:27.011 --> 01:29:30.693]  You can get them Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:30.733 --> 01:29:40.018]  Give them the book and the video, and go down there and hand deliver it and say, Sheriff, you know, America's in a lot of trouble, and this has got the solutions.
[01:29:41.118 --> 01:29:52.223]  This will help you rediscover what you're really supposed to do and that you're not a kept, vestigial, ceremonial, ventriloquist as you describe it, muppet of the New World Order.
[01:29:52.243 --> 01:29:53.344]  We're going to come right back from break.
[01:29:53.384 --> 01:29:54.825]  Listen up folks, this is important.
[01:29:55.005 --> 01:29:55.805]  Alex Jones here.
[01:29:56.105 --> 01:30:01.788]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy to fix, delicious food from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:02.128 --> 01:30:10.012]  From July 4th through July 14th, we have looming evacuations in the southeast, unemployment insurance running out, and predictions of huge inflation.
[01:30:10.272 --> 01:30:12.313]  So we all need to get as much food as we can.
[01:30:12.593 --> 01:30:15.595]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.
[01:30:15.775 --> 01:30:18.336]  This is the perfect time to do just that with eFoods Direct.
[01:30:18.536 --> 01:30:20.678]  And take advantage of their free shipping special.
[01:30:20.938 --> 01:30:30.626]  When you order from eFoodsDirect.com from July 4th through July 14th, every dollar you spend will buy the food and eFoodsDirect will pay for the shipping in the continental United States.
[01:30:31.086 --> 01:30:41.014]  This is Alex Jones wishing you and your family true independence this 4th of July with great food and free shipping through July 14th from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:30:41.174 --> 01:30:43.176]  You can order on the website eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:46.537]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:30:46.757 --> 01:30:47.117]  What have we got?
[01:30:47.137 --> 01:30:48.078]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:01.403 --> 01:31:04.987]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:31:05.067 --> 01:31:06.989]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:31:07.329 --> 01:31:09.231]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:31:09.351 --> 01:31:10.632]  So they think they own our land?
[01:31:11.053 --> 01:31:12.174]  They think they own our water?
[01:31:12.354 --> 01:31:12.754]  Children?
[01:31:12.974 --> 01:31:13.735]  Our education?
[01:31:14.075 --> 01:31:14.716]  Our money?
[01:31:14.916 --> 01:31:18.560]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:22.584]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:31:23.905 --> 01:31:24.726]  We have the facts.
[01:31:24.927 --> 01:31:26.048]  We have the Constitution.
[01:31:26.088 --> 01:31:26.969]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:31:26.989 --> 01:31:27.830]  We have common law.
[01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:30.132]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:30.392 --> 01:31:34.216]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:31:34.297 --> 01:31:39.082]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:31:39.462 --> 01:31:41.362]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[01:32:49.882 --> 01:32:51.623]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:33:08.919 --> 01:33:10.499]  We're going back to Sheriff Richard Mack.
[01:33:10.519 --> 01:33:11.820]  We're talking about solutions.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:12.840]  You want solutions?
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.060]  Take your county back.
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:15.561]  And the key place is the sheriff.
[01:33:15.861 --> 01:33:17.061]  Take your city council back.
[01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:18.181]  Take your statehouse back.
[01:33:18.621 --> 01:33:28.324]  But it's a lot easier to educate the sheriff or to get somebody to run for sheriff who's good, especially in this climate, than to take full control of the county commissioners or full control of the statehouse.
[01:33:28.644 --> 01:33:31.885]  Though that's starting to happen, and we're going to cover some of that news here in a moment.
[01:33:32.365 --> 01:33:33.925]  But this is such a central issue.
[01:33:34.145 --> 01:33:34.946]  You want solutions?
[01:33:35.046 --> 01:33:35.546]  It's work.
[01:33:36.286 --> 01:33:38.787]  But it's going to be more work being a slave.
[01:33:39.228 --> 01:33:40.748]  And this is exciting to do this.
[01:33:41.569 --> 01:33:48.112]  And so we're going to be talking more with Sheriff Richard Mack about his instrumental plan to get the sheriffs back that he's been pushing for over a decade.
[01:33:48.132 --> 01:33:50.733]  And it's really starting to bear fruit and it's very exciting.
[01:33:51.073 --> 01:33:54.115]  And the destiny of this nation and this republic is in your hands.
[01:33:54.135 --> 01:33:58.237]  Before we go any further, I want to tell you about purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:33:58.257 --> 01:33:59.858]  That's one word, purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:33:59.878 --> 01:34:01.439]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride,
[01:34:02.279 --> 01:34:04.401]  From your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:34:04.721 --> 01:34:06.622]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[01:34:06.903 --> 01:34:11.346]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[01:34:11.386 --> 01:34:12.327]  It's very inexpensive.
[01:34:12.767 --> 01:34:15.089]  The best part is it's all made in the USA.
[01:34:15.529 --> 01:34:20.833]  They have a wide variety of filters that remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower and bath filters.
[01:34:21.273 --> 01:34:28.759]  Check out their banners on PrisonPlanet and Infowars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com today to take control of your water supply.
[01:34:29.259 --> 01:34:30.439]  And it's made in the USA.
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:36.221]  I know that'll make the Feds mad, because if we have any industry left, we may still be independent, but it doesn't matter.
[01:34:36.241 --> 01:34:37.022]  The Feds are traders.
[01:34:37.402 --> 01:34:38.442]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:34:39.403 --> 01:34:43.004]  And finally, our wonderful sponsor, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:34:43.164 --> 01:34:48.866]  One word, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, forward slash free ship, or you can just find it on their main site.
[01:34:50.362 --> 01:34:51.603]  Um, until the 14th.
[01:34:51.823 --> 01:34:56.947]  So for another six days, free shipping anywhere in the continental United States.
[01:34:57.207 --> 01:34:59.508]  You can even do multiple orders, multiple locations.
[01:34:59.528 --> 01:35:00.749]  That is a huge value.
[01:35:01.069 --> 01:35:03.351]  One of the biggest expenses with storable food is the shipping.
[01:35:03.391 --> 01:35:05.012]  I've never seen him do a special this good.
[01:35:05.672 --> 01:35:08.054]  And it's the July 4th special running through July 14th.
[01:35:08.134 --> 01:35:09.655]  High quality storable foods.
[01:35:10.255 --> 01:35:11.957]  eFoodsDirect.com or give them a call 800-409-5633.
[01:35:11.977 --> 01:35:12.017]  800-409-5633.
[01:35:12.057 --> 01:35:14.418]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:29.748]  This is high-quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, brand-new, fresh food, a bunch of different food lines, efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[01:35:30.168 --> 01:35:31.129]  Absolutely essential.
[01:35:31.329 --> 01:35:33.370]  Okay, going back to Sheriff Richard Mack.
[01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:38.854]  People can get Don't Tread on Me, that I'm a consultant on and also in, with yourself, at infowars.com.
[01:35:39.634 --> 01:35:42.676]  And they've got to get it to every sheriff because it covers the same info that's in your book.
[01:35:42.956 --> 01:35:44.578]  But your book gets into more detail.
[01:35:44.998 --> 01:35:47.039]  And it's also, people respect books.
[01:35:47.079 --> 01:35:48.040]  It's important to have them.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.182]  You explain the power of the states.
[01:35:50.522 --> 01:35:52.103]  It's written from a sheriff's perspective.
[01:35:52.403 --> 01:35:53.904]  A guy that's won at the Supreme Court.
[01:35:54.144 --> 01:35:55.425]  You have a lot of gravitas.
[01:35:56.266 --> 01:36:01.970]  Again, give people the website or a number so they can get your book and get it in the hands of sheriffs.
[01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:05.372]  This is like a stake through the heart of vampires.
[01:36:05.773 --> 01:36:07.234]  Every sheriff that we wake up.
[01:36:08.103 --> 01:36:10.865]  Well, that is SheriffMac.com.
[01:36:10.945 --> 01:36:13.547]  Sheriff 1-R-2-S and Mac, M-A-C-K.
[01:36:14.127 --> 01:36:15.629]  Just go to SheriffMac.com.
[01:36:16.209 --> 01:36:20.352]  And the book actually needs to get to county commissioners and county attorneys.
[01:36:21.633 --> 01:36:23.514]  Most of the sheriffs in the country have the book.
[01:36:23.955 --> 01:36:26.677]  However, you need to follow up and make sure they read it.
[01:36:26.817 --> 01:36:29.239]  Just as you said, no one can guarantee they read it.
[01:36:29.279 --> 01:36:33.662]  We also have it on CD, so if somebody doesn't want to read, they can listen to it.
[01:36:34.322 --> 01:36:35.764]  Uh, and it is me reading the book.
[01:36:36.204 --> 01:36:53.019]  And then you can get these little booklets, and every state legislator, every county commissioner, every state and local official should see this little booklet, the Victory for State Sovereignty, because it reviews what we've been talking about here on the show, and it's in pocket-sized form, and in ten minutes,
[01:36:53.579 --> 01:37:02.544]  Your state rep or your local county commissioner or your local sheriff can see what this case actually did to restore state sovereignty in this country.
[01:37:02.564 --> 01:37:08.047]  Okay, we're going to talk about your plan and versus what the feds are doing, the alternative here in a moment.
[01:37:08.067 --> 01:37:19.433]  But I want to, since you are a sheriff from the West, I want to, you know, draw this analogy here and then get involved with what's happening on the Arizona border right now and this act of treason by Obama.
[01:37:20.254 --> 01:37:22.595]  But going back, we've all seen Westerns.
[01:37:23.115 --> 01:37:25.856]  Alex, let me just reiterate something that you said.
[01:37:25.876 --> 01:37:27.917]  This is about solutions.
[01:37:28.637 --> 01:37:31.938]  This isn't just talking about things that are horrible and going on in our country.
[01:37:31.958 --> 01:37:34.339]  We could do that until next year and still not finish.
[01:37:34.899 --> 01:37:43.002]  This is about a solution that is reasonable, effective, quick, and doable, and constitutional.
[01:37:43.062 --> 01:37:43.822]  And it's a law!
[01:37:43.902 --> 01:37:44.223]  It's a law!
[01:37:45.703 --> 01:37:51.044]  And we're going to get into that in a moment, but I want to just give people so they have a mental image of what's happened so they can have respect for themselves again.
[01:37:52.024 --> 01:38:06.767]  We've all seen those westerns and Matt Dillon and John Wayne, and I always thought growing up as a kid, you know, those are just movies where there's a corrupt town with bad guys in it robbing and raping and, you know, oppressing and taking farmers water and taking their daughters and finally people stand up.
[01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:08.987]  But, or I thought it was a Louis L'Amour novel.
[01:38:09.408 --> 01:38:11.228]  Now I've read a lot of histories of the West.
[01:38:12.148 --> 01:38:12.248]  It's
[01:38:31.667 --> 01:38:31.927]  I think?
[01:38:49.185 --> 01:38:52.467]  And, you know, the issue here is what's happening with the feds?
[01:38:52.487 --> 01:38:53.727]  What's happening in our society?
[01:38:53.767 --> 01:38:57.029]  We see that Hollywood image of the town finally standing up.
[01:38:57.269 --> 01:38:58.549]  That's what America is.
[01:38:58.590 --> 01:38:59.830]  That's what our counties are.
[01:39:00.090 --> 01:39:01.491]  That's what our societies are.
[01:39:01.531 --> 01:39:03.532]  And people, you've just got to get angry.
[01:39:03.552 --> 01:39:04.632]  You've got to start talking.
[01:39:04.652 --> 01:39:07.334]  You've got to turn the television set off.
[01:39:07.674 --> 01:39:09.215]  You've got to get to the Commissioner's Court.
[01:39:09.255 --> 01:39:10.315]  You've got to get with others.
[01:39:10.355 --> 01:39:11.436]  You've got to get angry.
[01:39:11.716 --> 01:39:13.837]  And you've got to get the facts and the Constitution.
[01:39:14.537 --> 01:39:21.941]  Because I'm going to say it again, it is like a stake through the heart of these vampires, because our country was born in the fight for liberty.
[01:39:22.041 --> 01:39:23.882]  We've been through this over and over again.
[01:39:24.082 --> 01:39:28.924]  We're not the first people to go through this, and we've got the blueprint of how to beat these people.
[01:39:29.885 --> 01:39:38.429]  We do, and it's every bit constitutional, it's every bit lawful, and it is a peaceful process.
[01:39:39.199 --> 01:39:43.401]  Uh, this will not hurt anyone, uh, except the traitors in Washington, D.C.
[01:39:43.841 --> 01:39:45.882]  There is no answer in Washington, D.C.
[01:39:45.902 --> 01:39:58.568]  Uh, it is the most corrupt place on the face of the planet, but we can make headway, uh, in our counties, and we can take America back county by county and state by state, but it's got to start with you, every one of your listeners,
[01:39:59.028 --> 01:40:02.090]  You've got to know and understand the principle of state sovereignty.
[01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:10.416]  Your sheriff has got to know and understand the principle of state sovereignty and local autonomy, and that's exactly what my lawsuit was about.
[01:40:10.916 --> 01:40:23.204]  Now, Judge John Rowe said, and that's also quoted in my little booklet that I have here in my hand, The Victory for State Sovereignty, he said, Mac is thus forced to choose between keeping his oath
[01:40:23.744 --> 01:40:24.464]  We're good to go.
[01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:41.712]  Which one are you going to do?
[01:40:42.173 --> 01:40:44.014]  Are you going to side with the people in freedom?
[01:40:44.034 --> 01:40:53.923]  Or are you going to continue to acquiesce and follow the... Well the founders had us swear to this oath because they wanted to point out this is the real law.
[01:40:54.344 --> 01:40:55.545]  This is the power.
[01:40:55.845 --> 01:40:57.346]  This is the America.
[01:40:57.666 --> 01:40:58.948]  This is the Republic.
[01:40:59.208 --> 01:40:59.988]  Not what some
[01:41:00.729 --> 01:41:05.795]  Flim Flammer comes along later with him and that's what Thomas Jefferson, George Washington said over and over again.
[01:41:05.815 --> 01:41:11.381]  You gotta stick to this, not what lawyers come and invent later or what they try to twist out of it.
[01:41:12.284 --> 01:41:14.826]  That's exactly correct, and this is all foundational.
[01:41:15.406 --> 01:41:16.287]  It's all fundamental.
[01:41:16.967 --> 01:41:23.331]  And on the first page of my book, I'm glad you talked about Thomas Jefferson, because I quote him on the very first page of my book.
[01:41:23.851 --> 01:41:35.439]  And he says, when all government shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided, and become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.
[01:41:35.819 --> 01:41:38.801]  The question is, Alex, to whom can your people turn?
[01:41:39.321 --> 01:41:50.535]  The people in Austin, Texas, or the people in Southern Arizona, or the people throughout this country, who can they turn to for peace, safety, and protection when government from Washington, D.C.
[01:41:50.575 --> 01:41:52.177]  has become venal and oppressive?
[01:41:52.518 --> 01:41:55.622]  And the answer is your county sheriff and your local officials.
[01:41:56.351 --> 01:42:17.787]  All right, well, let's describe the true role of the sheriff, because people have never been taught this, I mean, versus what's happening all over the country where the feds come in and will put tens of millions of dollars in and buy off sheriffs and counties to get the city to absorb the county when the county is the unit of the state.
[01:42:18.028 --> 01:42:19.209]  I mean, this is treason.
[01:42:19.269 --> 01:42:20.229]  I keep using that word.
[01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:23.152]  They know exactly what they're... This is federal?
[01:42:27.036 --> 01:42:37.829]  Well, my case even addresses that, and Scalia brings up the issue of compromising local authority in order to take federal grants and federal money.
[01:42:38.524 --> 01:42:40.345]  The federal government is very wise.
[01:42:40.705 --> 01:42:42.626]  Let's not pretend anything here.
[01:42:43.327 --> 01:42:52.371]  This plan of attack to destroy state sovereignty and local autonomy and the power of the counties has been an orchestrated event.
[01:42:53.052 --> 01:42:55.533]  They've even voted sheriffs out in Connecticut.
[01:42:55.573 --> 01:42:57.334]  There are no more sheriffs in Connecticut.
[01:42:57.774 --> 01:42:59.875]  Massachusetts is trying to do the same thing.
[01:43:00.336 --> 01:43:04.538]  Ohio now has one county where the sheriff is no longer elected but appointed.
[01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:20.266]  And every sheriff that I've talked to, and I've been talking to hundreds of sheriffs this past year, every one of them, well, not every one of them, but there's about a half of them that are worried if they take strong stands against the federal government and do what my book suggests,
[01:43:23.327 --> 01:43:25.568]  And again, that's a coward's mindset.
[01:43:25.608 --> 01:43:32.050]  We've gotten to this point of the sheriff being abolished because the enemy is attacking the Constitution and our Republic.
[01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:41.013]  And instead of saying, oh, I better cower, you know, for the five years or whatever you're in, you want to think about your kids and grandkids and you should get up there and stand up.
[01:43:41.033 --> 01:43:46.315]  I mean, how do we come from the toughest, roughest, smartest people to a bunch of castrated cowards?
[01:43:46.615 --> 01:43:48.116]  I tell you, those sheriffs are pathetic.
[01:43:48.595 --> 01:44:12.379]  Well, it's all about the money, and I have said this, and I say this in my book, that anyone in this country, I don't care if it's a sheriff, state rep, county commissioner, or anyone else, if you're willing to compromise liberty, if you're willing to compromise the freedom of your citizens to continue to take money, then you, sir, are the traitor, and you have betrayed your own people.
[01:44:13.081 --> 01:44:21.944]  This is time to stand, and when I sent this book to Sheriff Print, I said, Sheriff, tell me honestly, is this book true and is it the answer?
[01:44:21.964 --> 01:44:23.185]  And he says, of course it is.
[01:44:23.625 --> 01:44:26.326]  The problem is, you've got too many damn wimpy sheriffs.
[01:44:27.046 --> 01:44:30.068]  And Alex, I'm just going to tell it like it is.
[01:44:30.568 --> 01:44:38.471]  If the sheriffs in this country have the courage to stand, that's the only thing we lack now, is courage within our local communities.
[01:44:38.871 --> 01:44:40.191]  Courage from county attorneys.
[01:44:40.652 --> 01:44:41.852]  Courage from county sheriffs.
[01:44:42.513 --> 01:44:53.361]  Yeah, we don't need quasi-federal deputized federal toadies.
[01:44:53.401 --> 01:44:55.823]  We need the counties and people not liking the feds.
[01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:58.545]  That was back when America was free and people were smart.
[01:44:58.565 --> 01:45:02.468]  I mean, going back to our founding, not these little pathetic
[01:45:02.868 --> 01:45:23.800]  Tony's and creatures of the feds we need men we need strong leaders who are loved in their communities to bring back true peace officers not these law enforcement lackeys who desecrate the Constitution and enforce all this made-up crud now I want to bring up a subject here with you while we've got you Sheriff Mac we'll have you back soon but
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:30.345]  I want to read to you from Encyclopedia Britannica, and it's the same thing, and the definition, Wikipedia, they've all got it.
[01:45:30.725 --> 01:45:32.427]  High treason, the definition of high treason.
[01:45:32.727 --> 01:45:46.158]  Participating in a war against one's country, attempting to overthrow its government, spying on its military, its diplomats, or its secret services for a hostile and foreign power, or attempting to kill its head of state, and it goes on, are the best known types.
[01:45:46.598 --> 01:45:50.402]  Now, the most classic archetypal is enemies inside,
[01:45:51.102 --> 01:45:54.305]  The Gates, who are traitors, opening the drawbridge to let the enemy in.
[01:45:54.685 --> 01:46:01.010]  Now, we've got the states, 80 to 100 miles, a third of Arizona, where you were a sheriff, has imploded.
[01:46:01.090 --> 01:46:03.492]  Sheriff Babbo is begging for help.
[01:46:03.813 --> 01:46:04.753]  There's death threats.
[01:46:04.933 --> 01:46:11.159]  They've killed thousands of law enforcement, peace officers, but they are law enforcement down in Mexico, in this war.
[01:46:11.199 --> 01:46:17.284]  They're now literally roads, highways, the parkland, off limits,
[01:46:18.124 --> 01:46:23.529]  Uh, Obama tells Senator Kyle treacherously, I want to keep that crisis going so I get amnesty.
[01:46:23.569 --> 01:46:24.330]  That's on record.
[01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:26.612]  So we have all of this happening.
[01:46:26.772 --> 01:46:28.394]  Is that not high treason?
[01:46:28.414 --> 01:46:32.798]  I have the article, Obama commits act of high treason, sides with foreign power against Arizona.
[01:46:33.018 --> 01:46:33.939]  I have all the facts.
[01:46:34.319 --> 01:46:49.727]  I have the 11th Amendment saying the feds can't sue a state or an individual citizen on behalf of a foreign power or an alien because that was the first amendment they passed after the first ten because you know the states knew the feds could be bought off by foreign corporate powers.
[01:46:50.327 --> 01:46:57.191]  Is this not an act of treason by Obama going in there trying to block the state when it's trying to not collapse like Mexico?
[01:46:58.018 --> 01:47:03.683]  Well it is, and not only that, but there's more on the record about what Obama has done.
[01:47:03.723 --> 01:47:07.727]  Now remember, he brought Presidente Felipe Calderon
[01:47:08.607 --> 01:47:13.190]  From Mexico, to our own United States Congress, inside our U.S.
[01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:27.360]  Capitol, to assail and criticize our own Constitution, our own freedom, our own country, our own laws, and then he got a standing ovation from the liberals and the leftists and the traitors in Washington, D.C.
[01:47:27.901 --> 01:47:28.841]  All that was treason.
[01:47:29.382 --> 01:47:30.042]  Every bit of this.
[01:47:30.102 --> 01:47:33.505]  You cannot show me anything that Washington, D.C.
[01:47:33.545 --> 01:47:35.026]  has done in the past
[01:47:35.886 --> 01:47:36.106]  10, 20 years.
[01:47:36.207 --> 01:47:40.450]  NIST and GATT giving our authority to the WTO, an elected corporate board.
[01:47:40.670 --> 01:47:48.096]  The SPP that they kept secret, the Judicial Watch got, said we've got to keep this secret in the founding document that the President signed.
[01:47:48.276 --> 01:47:49.517]  We've got to keep this secret.
[01:47:49.537 --> 01:47:53.841]  We've got to bring a carbon tax in to erect a North American Union government.
[01:47:54.061 --> 01:47:57.484]  I mean, that is the definition of high treason!
[01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:08.355]  Anytime that you want to destroy or have politicians who attempt or want to destroy our own Constitution, I believe the Founding Fathers intended that to be treason.
[01:48:09.495 --> 01:48:15.658]  And there's only three law enforcement authorities granted to the federal government within Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S.
[01:48:15.718 --> 01:48:16.438]  Constitution.
[01:48:16.879 --> 01:48:19.720]  It's counterfeiting, felony committed on the high seas,
[01:48:20.481 --> 01:48:21.384]  And treason.
[01:48:21.745 --> 01:48:27.440]  Now, if the FBI would investigate treason in this country, they would never get out of Washington, D.C.
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:28.442]  for the next ten years.
[01:48:29.290 --> 01:48:32.793]  And that would be one time I would tell them they probably need more manpower.
[01:48:33.254 --> 01:48:37.918]  Because the treason going on in Washington DC right now is absolutely phenomenal.
[01:48:37.938 --> 01:48:54.853]  And it is treason, and going back to what's happening, instead of the traitors and the treasonous vermin bought and paid for by this global New World Order corporate takeover, and that's what it is, instead we've got the MIAC Homeland Security reports that Goodpeace officers sent us, where the government is not doing...
[01:48:55.854 --> 01:48:58.917]  That's a facade that they're worried about turbaned Arabs.
[01:48:58.937 --> 01:49:01.298]  I mean, that is literally just to get us to give our rights up.
[01:49:01.819 --> 01:49:13.668]  Ninety-plus percent of it, they are behind the scenes like roaches in a cheap motel, spending all their time hating veterans, conservatives, libertarians, gun owners, Ron Paul, myself, you.
[01:49:14.129 --> 01:49:20.614]  I mean, they are just doing nothing but trying to brainwash police and sheriff's departments that we are the devil.
[01:49:21.815 --> 01:49:23.957]  That really shows you who these people are.
[01:49:24.237 --> 01:49:29.581]  We're saying we want America back, and they're saying if you've got a portrait of John Wayne in your house, you're a terrorist.
[01:49:30.322 --> 01:49:36.426]  Yeah, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, I've been fighting them ever since I filed my lawsuit back in 1994.
[01:49:36.506 --> 01:49:38.168]  Yeah, they're writing those reports.
[01:49:38.808 --> 01:49:42.231]  And oh gosh, and these guys are absolutely out of control.
[01:49:42.731 --> 01:49:44.933]  They are the acorn of
[01:49:46.535 --> 01:49:48.237]  Of politics in America.
[01:49:48.377 --> 01:49:53.141]  Acorn being also a branch of the treason from the federal government.
[01:49:53.501 --> 01:49:55.643]  But Southern Poverty Law Center is just like Acorn.
[01:49:55.663 --> 01:50:03.969]  They get a lot of money from the federal government to lie and to do just the opposite of protecting our Constitution.
[01:50:04.309 --> 01:50:06.191]  They want to destroy our Constitution.
[01:50:06.251 --> 01:50:11.115]  And I'm proud to be listed with you and other patriots of this country.
[01:50:11.575 --> 01:50:11.975]  I'm number 18.
[01:50:13.336 --> 01:50:40.194]  Uh, on that list, and I'm very proud to stand with you and Ron Paul and Chuck Baldwin and Joe Bannister and others, uh, uh, Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, and I'm proud to be, uh, on the board of directors of Oath Keepers, and this is all boiling down to whether or not the peace officers in this country, the sheriffs of this country, will do one thing, and that is to uphold and defend their oath of office, to uphold and defend the Constitution.
[01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:41.494]  God bless you.
[01:50:41.594 --> 01:50:42.195]  Absolutely.
[01:50:42.275 --> 01:50:44.876]  Our names are on that John Hancock.
[01:50:44.896 --> 01:50:46.337]  They're on that Constitution.
[01:50:46.677 --> 01:50:50.359]  That's an enemy warrant against us by these traitors.
[01:50:50.399 --> 01:50:51.179]  And they are traitors.
[01:50:51.479 --> 01:50:53.040]  We'll be right back with Sheriff Mack.
[01:50:58.542 --> 01:50:59.583]  Afraid to answer it?
[01:51:00.498 --> 01:51:01.980]  Afraid to answer your door?
[01:51:02.421 --> 01:51:09.429]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[01:51:09.710 --> 01:51:11.772]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[01:51:11.933 --> 01:51:13.715]  They are expensive payment plans.
[01:51:13.955 --> 01:51:17.019]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself
[01:51:17.099 --> 01:51:17.339]  I think.

[01:54:09.769 --> 01:54:11.510]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:11.530 --> 01:54:14.073]  Just in other news before we finish up with Sheriff Richard Mack.
[01:54:14.673 --> 01:54:20.898]  We saw local Fox News say the Army's searching people's cars and putting them through x-ray machines in Albany, New York.
[01:54:20.938 --> 01:54:27.544]  And I saw newscasts suddenly in Illinois where it's happening and regular Marines in California searching people for DWIs.
[01:54:27.824 --> 01:54:29.385]  I mean, this is martial law.
[01:54:30.186 --> 01:54:30.766]  And here it is.
[01:54:31.046 --> 01:54:33.607]  New York National Guard involved in mass arrest of U.S.
[01:54:33.627 --> 01:54:34.088]  citizens.
[01:54:34.488 --> 01:54:37.829]  We reported on part one of this Fox show yesterday.
[01:54:37.929 --> 01:54:44.972]  Now we have part two, where they announced on the show, oh, the Army is arresting people for drinking, for guns.
[01:54:45.672 --> 01:54:50.454]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is a strategic, creeping, federal takeover.
[01:54:50.954 --> 01:54:55.896]  And we've warned you, and now they're talking about 400,000 regular Army on the streets of America.
[01:54:56.716 --> 01:54:59.657]  They've got threat fusion centers, federalizing local police.
[01:55:00.077 --> 01:55:03.158]  We have got to slow this down and then reverse it.
[01:55:03.599 --> 01:55:05.199]  And that's where Sheriff Mack comes in.
[01:55:05.739 --> 01:55:06.320]  Here's another one.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:08.120]  This is up on GCNlive.com.
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:11.782]  Obama's science czar called for global carbon tax.
[01:55:11.802 --> 01:55:13.862]  The government kept these Holdren documents secret.
[01:55:14.223 --> 01:55:15.223]  They've now released them.
[01:55:15.243 --> 01:55:21.305]  The science czar said we quote must redistribute the wealth of America to the southern hemisphere.
[01:55:21.685 --> 01:55:23.066]  This is another act of treason.
[01:55:23.769 --> 01:55:25.313]  And of course he means to the banks down there.
[01:55:25.714 --> 01:55:27.538]  I mean, folks, these are criminals.
[01:55:27.819 --> 01:55:28.902]  He wants to ruin you.
[01:55:29.223 --> 01:55:30.085]  This is by design.
[01:55:30.105 --> 01:55:30.706]  This is stated.
[01:55:31.027 --> 01:55:31.528]  Here's another one.
[01:55:31.568 --> 01:55:32.370]  Harvard professor.
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:35.281]  GCNLive.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:55:35.802 --> 01:55:37.322]  And then we've got a link to the Korean Times.
[01:55:37.623 --> 01:55:43.106]  He's the former chief economist of the IMF, says exploit Gulf disaster for carbon tax and that it's a good thing.
[01:55:43.146 --> 01:55:44.827]  GCNLive.com.
[01:55:44.947 --> 01:55:49.890]  Gulf Coast now a BP police state as law enforcement conspires with BP to intimidate journalists.
[01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:51.290]  GCNLive.com.
[01:55:51.591 --> 01:55:53.031]  These articles are all so important.
[01:55:53.272 --> 01:55:54.692]  Climategate whitewash complete.
[01:55:54.752 --> 01:55:56.493]  Third inquiry clears everyone involved.
[01:55:56.734 --> 01:55:58.294]  GCNLive.com by Steve Watson.
[01:55:59.695 --> 01:56:04.656]  The inquiry was all filled with global warming crooks, with global warming people who promoted it.
[01:56:04.696 --> 01:56:05.636]  It's all a fraud!
[01:56:05.917 --> 01:56:08.017]  Sheriff Mack, we've got three minutes left here at the end.
[01:56:08.037 --> 01:56:09.637]  This is make it or break it.
[01:56:09.677 --> 01:56:14.659]  We are going into bondage, but our ancestors rose to the occasion.
[01:56:14.939 --> 01:56:20.180]  Will we rise to the occasion, or will we go into slavery because it was too fun to drink beer and watch TV?
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:25.241]  Well, I'm afraid there's one way to prevent it.
[01:56:25.996 --> 01:56:27.096]  And it's at your local level.
[01:56:27.136 --> 01:56:51.144]  The answer to that question, if you want to stop tyranny, if you want to stop the UN, if you want to stop the global gun grab, if you want to stop the land grab, if you want to protect your children and your families' freedom and liberty, if you want to protect your Constitution, you must start with your local sheriff, your county commission, and do it in your own town and in your own county.
[01:56:51.464 --> 01:56:53.245]  That's the only answer left.
[01:56:54.772 --> 01:56:55.613]  We can do it.
[01:56:56.173 --> 01:56:59.995]  I'm having emails from sheriff candidates all across this country.
[01:57:00.395 --> 01:57:01.855]  I'm helping them with their campaigns.
[01:57:02.316 --> 01:57:11.680]  I was contacted by AP talking about all the sheriff races across the country that are concentrating on which candidate will be the most constitutional sheriff.
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:21.404]  If you have a constitutional sheriff who will protect you from all enemies, both foreign and domestic, who will protect you from the gun grabbers and protect you from the globalists,
[01:57:22.004 --> 01:57:23.666]  And if we can convert, if we can convert
[01:57:36.977 --> 01:57:46.739]  The massive Tea Party energy, not just in the congressional candidates, but in the sheriffs, and point out the incumbency of these corrupt sheriffs and get patriots in.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.960]  This is another major move on the chessboard.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:53.341]  The next move is checkmate of the enemy if we can do this.
[01:57:53.381 --> 01:57:54.762]  Sheriff Mack, I salute you.
[01:57:55.222 --> 01:57:58.042]  I salute your passion and Oath Keepers and all the work we're doing.
[01:57:58.282 --> 01:58:02.123]  We know the enemy is going to stage terror attacks like Oklahoma City and try to blame it on us.
[01:58:02.143 --> 01:58:03.264]  It's not going to work.
[01:58:03.304 --> 01:58:04.444]  We've got the word out on that.
[01:58:04.804 --> 01:58:06.565]  I'll look forward to talking to you again soon.
[01:58:06.845 --> 01:58:08.366]  Have a great weekend that's coming up, sir.
[01:58:08.686 --> 01:58:09.446]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:58:09.486 --> 01:58:09.966]  I'll see you soon.
[01:58:10.126 --> 01:58:13.428]  People can go to Sheriff Mac's website and find out about where you're speaking next, correct?
[01:58:14.288 --> 01:58:14.588]  You bet.
[01:58:14.648 --> 01:58:14.988]  Thank you.
[01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.429]  All right.
[01:58:15.449 --> 01:58:16.109]  God bless you, sir.
[01:58:16.129 --> 01:58:16.689]  We're out of time.
[01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:18.310]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.890]  One place.
