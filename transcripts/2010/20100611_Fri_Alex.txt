[00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:10.058]  We are going to continue with your phone calls throughout the entire broadcast today.
[00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:21.662]  We've got our weekly visit with Bob Chapman coming up on the financial markets and where that's going and the fact that the Wall Street Journal, MSNBC are saying total collapse next year.
[00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:27.805]  So it's gone from them saying the economy is getting better to more and more mainline analysts saying total collapse.
[00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:37.711]  Now I wanted to get Gary Franchi up because he's a great guy and he's just doing so much important work and we're also today launching
[00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:42.320]  I procrastinated a bit because we've been busy, but we've now uploaded it in the highest quality.
[00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.928]  Camp FEMA now available online at PrisonPlanet.TV for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:52.113]  We're also simulcasting the radio show right now at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:54.437]  But I also suggest you buy the hard copy.
[00:00:54.457 --> 00:00:55.298]  In fact, let me grab it.
[00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:10.774]  of the film and support the filmmakers Gary Franchi and William Lewis with Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, featuring Cynthia Davis, Charles Key, Richard Mack, Alex Jones, Michael Bagnerig, Edwin Vieira, and many others.
[00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:12.755]  This is about taking our country back.
[00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:25.365]  The 9th Amendment, the 10th Amendment, getting good sheriffs elected, getting good legislatures elected, and then if Obama and FEMA say for 40-something days the states aren't allowed to build their own berms or block the oil until it's too late,
[00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:35.868]  If the states knew their rights, and we had patriots at the state level, I mean, look, it's pathetic to see Jindal and others saying, we're not allowed to fix it.
[00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:38.848]  Since when are you waiting for the feds?
[00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:48.491]  I mean, do you call the feds to clean the snow off your roof if you live in, say, Chicago or Detroit or New York?
[00:01:50.427 --> 00:01:53.371]  Government, come clean the snow off my roof so it doesn't cave in!
[00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:55.033]  Come right away!
[00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:57.116]  Will you please come right now?
[00:01:57.136 --> 00:02:03.045]  I mean, this is so elementary!
[00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:05.995]  This is so simple.
[00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:08.196]  The film covers that, and it's about solutions.
[00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:14.700]  And I want to go to calls with Franchi, for everybody that's holding quickly, with a quick comment, quick question from people.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.580]  I'm going to move fast.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.943]  But he's having a national viewing nationwide of Don't Tread on Me.
[00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:22.664]  Again, you can watch it in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:27.267]  And now, their last film, Camp FEMA, documenting the FEMA camps, that's gone up today.
[00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:27.947]  Now available.
[00:02:28.327 --> 00:02:30.188]  You can watch it online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:34.351]  But it is important to buy the hard copies so we can fund these operations.
[00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:36.032]  So we can make future films.
[00:02:36.913 --> 00:02:44.458]  Whether it's Invisible Empire, or Police State for the Rise of FEMA, or Don't Tread on Me, they're all available on DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:50.482]  But Gary, very exciting to have you joining us from Chicago via video Skype.
[00:02:51.102 --> 00:03:04.311]  Tell us about this press release, this national event you're asking Infowarriors to get involved in, and I certainly hope they do, because every act of resistance is victory, and this film is key in reigniting the understanding of the Tenth Amendment.
[00:03:04.891 --> 00:03:13.735]  But first off, what do you think of the states saying, we're not allowed to clean up the oil, we have to wait for Obama to tell us we can?
[00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:17.017]  I just want to say thanks for having me on the show.
[00:03:17.377 --> 00:03:24.400]  As far as what you're talking about, the states waiting for the federal government to come in, that's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:26.301]  The states did not wait for
[00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:28.013]  Yeah.
[00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.960]  And that's the beauty of America.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.202]  We take a few punches and we keep rolling.
[00:03:54.562 --> 00:03:58.124]  Why wait for big government to come in and clean up the mess?
[00:03:58.184 --> 00:03:59.144]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:01.045]  And the states need to pick up the ball.
[00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:06.028]  And look, they need to call in their local militias if they have local militias.
[00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:07.529]  I mean, that's what this film is also about.
[00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:10.814]  They need to call them in and start cleaning up the mess.
[00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:11.214]  That's right.
[00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:22.087]  If we had a militia like we were supposed to and not some dirty word, the sheriff would say, okay, all the men that are in the militia under federal and state law, you know, get out here and help us deal with that.
[00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:23.949]  But the feds have the opposite.
[00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:36.356]  They have a federalized, federal police force militia that doesn't work, that's over-cost, that doesn't know the local terrain, and that comes in every time there's a crisis and uses it to expand control.
[00:04:36.617 --> 00:04:43.641]  They do not want us being self-sufficient at the local level, and that's why they hate the constitutional militia.
[00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:46.683]  Well, plus they have all of our soldiers overseas.
[00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:49.304]  That's a good point.
[00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:50.865]  You know?
[00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.087]  What's your take on the oil spill overall?
[00:04:54.158 --> 00:04:55.758]  Well, I think it's disgusting.
[00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.100]  British Petroleum, I believe we fought a revolutionary war against Britain.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.161]  Now we're going ahead and buying all of our oil from them and they're destroying the Gulf Coast.
[00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.221]  I think it's despicable.
[00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:12.503]  I think the BP CEO sold out a bunch of his shares beforehand.
[00:05:12.683 --> 00:05:13.343]  Did he know?
[00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:14.303]  I don't know.
[00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:16.584]  Apparently their safety record is
[00:05:17.604 --> 00:05:18.705]  Very substandard.
[00:05:19.246 --> 00:05:24.811]  So, these guys are reckless, and they need to be held accountable, and the states need to step up to clean up, not wait for the feds.
[00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:25.712]  Don't wait for Obama.
[00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:26.032]  Come on.
[00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.076]  But Obama made the grass grow.
[00:05:30.116 --> 00:05:31.477]  He made the sun come out today.
[00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:32.698]  Are you denying that, Gary?
[00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:33.699]  Are you with Al Qaeda?
[00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:34.720]  Is that sacrilege?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.704]  You've got a needle to Pope Hussein the 10th.
[00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:43.708]  Well, I actually have a constitution under my bed, too, so watch out.
[00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:50.479]  Well, you've seen Abby Newman in Road to Tyranny when the police pull her over and she's got a pocket constitution.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.103]  They're literally holding it like it's a dead rat or something and they're scared of it.
[00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:56.464]  That was a great film.
[00:05:56.844 --> 00:05:57.305]  Great film.
[00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:04.590]  Now, Gary, tell folks about how they can be a big part of reigniting the Tenth Amendment.
[00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.033]  Because if we reignite the Tenth Amendment, it's bye-bye New World Order.
[00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:17.852]  Well, the way the founders set up this country was to have all these sovereign states work in concert in a federal structure.
[00:06:18.432 --> 00:06:26.795]  So the states remained sovereign and they sent their representatives, who represented the people, to do the people's work in D.C.
[00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:29.235]  Now, the representatives are doing their own bidding.
[00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:35.617]  They're working for themselves, they're working for their party politics, and they're corrupt.
[00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:37.274]  You know, special interests.
[00:06:37.515 --> 00:06:46.759]  So, what we're doing now, by reigniting the Tenth Amendment, reigniting the Second Amendment, reigniting the constitutional militia, is with this film.
[00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:57.904]  And what I really am so excited to report, Alex, is that we have 192 cities in 42 states who have actually signed up to have screenings.
[00:06:58.124 --> 00:07:03.526]  There are over 106 screenings going to take place nationwide on June 26th.
[00:07:04.887 --> 00:07:06.929]  All across the country, on or around June 26th.
[00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:10.591]  I know there's going to be one in Houston at the Alamo Draft House.
[00:07:11.092 --> 00:07:18.558]  The guys down there have over 106 people signed up on their Facebook page to have that screening.
[00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:23.682]  People are renting libraries, theaters, they're doing it in their churches.
[00:07:23.742 --> 00:07:28.445]  And again, when this is over, America won't be saved, but we'll be
[00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:41.172]  On that thousand mile journey, another five, six miles on the way, and look at how Lindsey Graham has now come out against the global warming tax, because he was outed, the fact that he's being blackmailed.
[00:07:42.032 --> 00:07:46.114]  Look at how they're now, Bilderberg is admitting internally that their whole system's in trouble.
[00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:51.417]  Right as they attain their world government, we see cracks all in the facade.
[00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:57.660]  And the bottom line is, we can defeat these people if we understand that it's all about little actions.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.861]  Millions of little actions build up.
[00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:02.622]  It's death by a million cuts.
[00:08:03.162 --> 00:08:06.003]  And every one of us may be like a mosquito to the New World Order.
[00:08:06.343 --> 00:08:08.504]  But we come over and bite the New World Order.
[00:08:08.964 --> 00:08:11.746]  We come over and sting the New World Order like a little bee.
[00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:14.327]  One bee stings you, you don't die.
[00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:16.448]  But a hundred bees sting you, most people will die.
[00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:23.996]  You're talking about going down that road, that thousand mile road, and we're going in five mile increments.
[00:08:24.556 --> 00:08:27.380]  Ed Griffin did a great work.
[00:08:29.162 --> 00:08:33.887]  Something he always references is you cannot turn a cruise ship around mid
[00:08:35.407 --> 00:08:46.332]  You know, it takes a long time to turn that cruise ship around and we are in the process of shifting that rudder to bring us back to the constitutional foundation this country was founded upon.
[00:08:46.612 --> 00:08:52.234]  Because of your show, because of your viewers, because of the supporters out there who are signing up to have screenings of this film.
[00:08:52.998 --> 00:08:56.599]  Absolutely, and what we don't need is people always whining.
[00:08:56.659 --> 00:09:07.783]  Every time we have a victory, I see the comments, most of them federally paid for, and that's come out in the news, going, there's no way to win, this is pathetic, this guy's a fed, that guy's a fed, just trying to get us all infighting.
[00:09:08.143 --> 00:09:15.725]  We need to just ignore those people and preach the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Second Amendment, expose the central banks, expose the New World Order.
[00:09:16.286 --> 00:09:20.327]  So as things get worse, people know who to blame, and they know
[00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.130]  The way out of this.
[00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.915]  We've gotta expose the criminals, but also...
[00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.306]  Lay out the alternative and have a national debate about it.
[00:09:29.826 --> 00:09:36.007]  And I'm telling you, the globalists already, because they're intelligent, they've done the studies, they're already acting like losers.
[00:09:36.027 --> 00:09:40.068]  They're buying armored compounds, they're moving out of the Western world, they're digging in.
[00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:49.810]  And now their policy is to just completely wreck us, where we're so wrecked and so poor, we're too busy trying to survive to bring them to justice.
[00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.270]  Well, I got news for them.
[00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:59.937]  We're going to take that attack, like in a judo move, and we're going to throw them literally in a backflip that's going to break their political back.
[00:10:00.057 --> 00:10:07.163]  We are going to annihilate them, and it is the political understanding of this that is unstoppable.
[00:10:07.584 --> 00:10:08.825]  It is unstoppable.
[00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:10.646]  So I commend you, Gary.
[00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:14.089]  Give folks the website so they can find out more about hosting a screening.
[00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.591]  And again, folks, once you have a screening,
[00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:17.852]  I think?
[00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:41.534]  After 200 people come to a movie or 50 or 10 to your local library, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:47.240]  Two people together can change a whole town if they take action over time and say, now let's go to City Council.
[00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:49.343]  Let's form an anti-fluoride group here.
[00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:56.931]  Let's go read every week in Citizens Communications government documents about fluoride causing brain damage and sterility and reduced fertility.
[00:10:58.413 --> 00:11:05.197]  Or let's go, you know, talk about the phony drug war and how the government ships in drugs every week at city council or the state legislature.
[00:11:05.577 --> 00:11:15.223]  Or let's go to the legislature, you know, a hundred of us with packets of info and talk to legislators about passing 10th and 9th Amendment resolutions and what that means in our state.
[00:11:15.484 --> 00:11:18.025]  Pick an issue, pick an enemy, attack it!
[00:11:18.045 --> 00:11:19.786]  I mean, that's how this works, folks.
[00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:20.927]  Take action.
[00:11:20.987 --> 00:11:22.468]  Stop screwing around.
[00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:23.168]  Okay?
[00:11:23.369 --> 00:11:25.951]  When you engage the enemy, you will smash them.
[00:11:26.132 --> 00:11:29.075]  But you've got to get up off your hind ends and start engaging them.
[00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:30.076]  We've got the truth.
[00:11:30.276 --> 00:11:31.097]  We've got history.
[00:11:31.277 --> 00:11:32.558]  We've got the red, white, and blue.
[00:11:32.738 --> 00:11:34.660]  We've got George Washington's spirit behind us.
[00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:37.123]  We've got what it takes.
[00:11:37.243 --> 00:11:38.805]  We've got the red blood.
[00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:40.446]  All they've got's the scam.
[00:11:40.606 --> 00:11:43.790]  We can sweep these people aside as soon as we get a fighting spirit.
[00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:45.885]  Amen, Alex.
[00:11:46.225 --> 00:11:46.866]  Amen to that.
[00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:58.991]  You know, one thing in the film that we talk about is solutions, and Charles Key, one of the representatives in the state of Oklahoma, has some excellent, excellent solutions that give teeth to the Tenth Amendment.
[00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:03.393]  A lot of people say, well, oh, you can pass a resolution, but it just, it doesn't mean anything.
[00:12:03.794 --> 00:12:10.637]  Well, he has actual legislation he talks about in the film that will give teeth to the Tenth Amendment, and we want everyone to go
[00:12:11.553 --> 00:12:11.913]  Well done!
[00:12:33.762 --> 00:12:38.145]  Well done, and they can do it again in a month later in July and have 500 cities.
[00:12:38.905 --> 00:12:41.707]  And again, people are welcome to do this with my documentaries as well.
[00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:43.008]  Get the word out.
[00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:55.155]  But this film is so important because it deals with how to take the states back, how to take the counties back, how to get our sheriff selected, how to kick the corrupt feds, who are nothing but errand boys for offshore banks, out of our states.
[00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:56.195]  Get out of here!
[00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:58.977]  And how the states can say, we're keeping our money.
[00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:02.218]  The Feds aren't going to tell us how to live our lives.
[00:13:02.438 --> 00:13:04.259]  The Feds aren't going to tell us how to run our schools.
[00:13:04.499 --> 00:13:06.840]  The Feds aren't going to tell us what to do with our... It's over!
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:07.520]  It's over!
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.461]  Gary Franchi, let's go to some calls.
[00:13:09.481 --> 00:13:16.043]  I want to go to the Genesis phone line system, then I'll go back to Adam, Rachel and others that are holding on our phone system down here.
[00:13:16.063 --> 00:13:17.723]  We're taking calls on both phone systems today.
[00:13:18.824 --> 00:13:20.845]  Who is up first here, Genesis?
[00:13:20.865 --> 00:13:21.745]  Who should I go to first?
[00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:25.456]  Mike in Georgia!
[00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:27.757]  Down there with all the Georgia peaches.
[00:13:27.817 --> 00:13:28.597]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:13:28.998 --> 00:13:37.102]  Yes, Mr. Jones, when talking about this incident down in the Gulf, there's two things that come up that I would like to be asked of anybody that has any expertise.
[00:13:37.242 --> 00:13:44.046]  One of them is the casing that they changed the design just days before the incident happened.
[00:13:44.066 --> 00:13:47.448]  It went from a 5-inch casing to what was reported as a 9-7-8 to a 7-inch diameter.
[00:13:51.195 --> 00:14:09.265]  And this was discussed in the MMS Coast Guard hearings, and I'm quoting out of this, when they're talking to Mark Hafley, who was the VP engineer, it says, when they went to ask him the question, don't you think the size of the casing you set up, your haliburton c-manners for failure.
[00:14:10.546 --> 00:14:15.309]  And so basically, you know, it doesn't sound like they were trying to tunnel, it sounds like they were trying to build a bomb.
[00:14:16.368 --> 00:14:26.635]  No, no, I've seen that and excise that out again and send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com because I read that a few days ago and exactly.
[00:14:27.036 --> 00:14:33.601]  And that's why everybody started throwing fits two weeks before when they got the order to add a larger casing.
[00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:44.205]  On top of a smaller casing, and I know petroleum geologists don't know very little about drilling, but more than most of the general public, because I've done some research on it, but still almost nothing.
[00:14:44.525 --> 00:14:47.386]  And we're going to do some shows with drilling experts, petroleum geologists.
[00:14:47.806 --> 00:14:54.269]  A lot of them are scared to come on because they don't want to be blackballed by BP, because they all work together with the oil companies, kind of stick together.
[00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:06.515]  It's on record that the people were on the rig, and this isn't normal, calling up, I mean, head engineers and cussing at the BP people in Houston.
[00:15:06.955 --> 00:15:10.136]  I mean, going, listen, you bleeper, this is going to blow up!
[00:15:10.797 --> 00:15:12.057]  And then two weeks later it did.
[00:15:12.097 --> 00:15:23.863]  I mean, the men on the ships and the other engineers sat there and watched engineers, and believe me, this doesn't go on, folks, because I've talked to a lot of my family that works with petroleum engineers, roughnecks, plant managers,
[00:15:24.483 --> 00:15:29.026]  I had a great-uncle just died who ran, for decades, one of the biggest plants in Houston.
[00:15:29.426 --> 00:15:34.209]  I mean, let me tell you, those people are yes sir, no sir, and that's old-fashioned, and they bust their butt.
[00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:36.871]  I mean, it's like a slave operation on these oil rigs.
[00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:41.694]  You know, my uncle worked offshore, the one out in East Texas.
[00:15:41.834 --> 00:15:43.215]  In fact, I ought to get him on about this.
[00:15:43.835 --> 00:15:51.360]  And, you know, you don't have head engineers with two or three degrees going, listen, you effin' idiots, this is gonna blow up!
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.441]  I mean, do you understand that that's on record, that that was going on?
[00:15:55.242 --> 00:16:03.326]  Well, there's also on record, they talk about how they dumped the drilling mud before the concrete had an opportunity to set up.
[00:16:03.446 --> 00:16:06.288]  There was a professor, Robert B. He was on 60 Minutes.
[00:16:06.988 --> 00:16:08.189]  He's from UC Berkeley.
[00:16:08.249 --> 00:16:09.529]  He's an engineer there.
[00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:10.650]  He's been testifying.
[00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.331]  And that's the other thing I like.
[00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:16.413]  Why did they let the drilling mud out before it had an opportunity to set up?
[00:16:17.194 --> 00:16:19.735]  It's like they pulled the pin on the grenade with that one.
[00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:23.576]  And the other one about redesigning is like that's when they designed the bomb.
[00:16:26.078 --> 00:16:26.779]  It's amazing.
[00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:29.020]  I've read that and that's the problem.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.582]  I read all this and I get in here and it's like, how do you even cover it?
[00:16:31.602 --> 00:16:33.323]  I'm going to try to do some of that with Chapman.
[00:16:33.343 --> 00:16:34.884]  Just hit headlines and get his take on it.
[00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:36.786]  Some way to get all this news out.
[00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:52.857]  Gary Franchi, I mean that is crazy that they did something here never done before and unorthodox and hours before it blew up they made another secret alteration that had people all over the drilling rig throwing fits.
[00:16:54.295 --> 00:16:58.416]  Well, it's irresponsible behavior and look what happened.
[00:16:58.456 --> 00:17:03.317]  Now we have the fishing, shrimping boats out there in Louisiana.
[00:17:03.637 --> 00:17:04.537]  People are getting sick.
[00:17:05.217 --> 00:17:06.278]  Industry is dying there.
[00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:19.200]  It's an absolute national tragedy and it's just one more reason why we have to move to alternative fuels, hydrogen fuel cells based on water, Stanley Myers type technology.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.661]  That's the solution, Alex.
[00:17:23.737 --> 00:17:28.667]  Just a few weeks ago, Jacobson here in the office brought me an amazing, a new scientist article.
[00:17:29.568 --> 00:17:30.530]  Then we pulled up some others.
[00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.552]  For MIT...
[00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:43.510]  In the last few years developed a type of cheap solar panel that could literally free us from the power grid and then the World Bank bought it and won't let anyone have it.
[00:17:43.971 --> 00:17:54.414]  Just another example of confirmed technology that taxpayer money pays for and then that DARPA just grabs and goes, here you go World Bank, you're our banking parasites, we worship you.
[00:17:54.754 --> 00:17:56.135]  More calls straight ahead, stay with us.

[00:18:58.259 --> 00:19:03.606]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:19:03.847 --> 00:19:08.473]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:19:08.874 --> 00:19:09.274]  It's true.
[00:19:09.354 --> 00:19:13.921]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:19.123]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:26.585]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:27.666]  And here's the best part.

[00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:46.297]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:58.631]  The problem.
[00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.772]  How do I cook food without power?
[00:20:01.293 --> 00:20:03.455]  How do I light my home with no electricity?

[00:20:06.678 --> 00:20:08.299]  How can I make safe drinking water?

[00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:03.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:06.582]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:21:10.578 --> 00:21:13.320]  Gary Franchi taking your phone calls with us five minutes to the next hour.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.541]  Then it's going to be Bob Chapman.
[00:21:14.601 --> 00:21:17.083]  I'm going to be interspersing news during that interview.
[00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:24.729]  You know, I wanted to spend a whole hour today on Boat's Head to Team Sailor Drifting in Indian Ocean.
[00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:31.435]  I said a prayer for her myself, because when you have children, especially daughters, you just imagine your 16-year-old daughter
[00:21:34.315 --> 00:21:49.390]  My daughters aren't 16 yet, but you imagine them in the future, 16, out in the southern Indian Ocean between Africa and Australia, totally shark-infested waters, 30-plus foot waves, and how the nanny state wants to ban
[00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:55.196]  Thirteen, fourteen-year-old scaling Everest.
[00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:59.279]  Her brother, when he was sixteen, had the world record sailing circumnavigating the globe.
[00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:04.341]  You know how many thousands of ships have gone down just coming to the New World?
[00:22:04.882 --> 00:22:06.423]  How many tens of thousands of ships?
[00:22:07.023 --> 00:22:15.948]  In some cases, reading some of the logs from the seventeen, eighteen hundreds, sixteen hundreds before that, as many as a third of the ships would be lost.
[00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:19.150]  I mean, full-grown men on sailing ships get lost.
[00:22:19.946 --> 00:22:23.549]  This is what our species has done to build what we built.
[00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.232]  We're going to have those type of losses that we expect to colonize space.
[00:22:28.173 --> 00:22:30.295]  This is what humanity is all about.
[00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:32.217]  I don't have the courage.
[00:22:32.837 --> 00:22:36.441]  I'm not scared of, like, fighting some, you know, 200-pound guy with a knife.
[00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:41.125]  But I am scared of getting on a sailboat and circumnavigating the world.
[00:22:41.385 --> 00:22:42.626]  I've been out in the middle of the ocean.
[00:22:42.666 --> 00:22:43.287]  It's scary.
[00:22:44.348 --> 00:22:45.529]  We're all scared of different things.
[00:22:48.953 --> 00:22:50.353]  This is pure Americana.
[00:22:50.393 --> 00:22:51.393]  This is pure human.
[00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:53.294]  This is pure trailblazing.
[00:22:54.534 --> 00:23:02.095]  And this young lady, instead of watching TV and playing with her iPad all day, she is out there doing something special.
[00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:05.536]  You know how many men died trying to circumnavigate the globe?
[00:23:06.416 --> 00:23:08.336]  Do you know who circumnavigated the globe first?
[00:23:08.436 --> 00:23:08.997]  Magellan.
[00:23:09.897 --> 00:23:10.777]  He died, by the way.
[00:23:10.817 --> 00:23:11.657]  His ship made it back.
[00:23:11.677 --> 00:23:14.678]  I think it was only like 16 people alive out of hundreds that went.
[00:23:15.238 --> 00:23:17.018]  The ship had rotted down to almost nothing.
[00:23:18.456 --> 00:23:19.938]  It took him, what was it, three years?
[00:23:20.678 --> 00:23:24.363]  Magellan got killed fighting natives trying to come in and water and get coconuts.
[00:23:25.624 --> 00:23:26.565]  Circumnavigator.
[00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:29.148]  She's doing what Magellan did.
[00:23:29.168 --> 00:23:30.830]  All right, I'm going to shut up now.
[00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:36.015]  Gary Franchi, and again, in the midst of all this big global news, all these things that are happening,
[00:23:37.256 --> 00:23:53.032]  It's still interesting, and just to hear this morning that she put out the emergency beacons when her boat got capsized in those 30-foot, and it was what was predicted, a rogue wave, which comes in from the wrong angle, and that she's alive, at least for now.
[00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:55.531]  That is great, Nash.
[00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:39.175]  And the New World Order's one desire is to outlaw that spirit, outlaw that behavior, and make us jellyfish.
[00:24:39.435 --> 00:24:40.835]  And that's why people aren't happy.
[00:24:41.035 --> 00:24:42.356]  Because they're not alive.
[00:24:44.039 --> 00:24:44.899]  You're absolutely right.
[00:24:44.979 --> 00:24:50.782]  The New World Order is crushing the human spirit, and we have to revitalize the human spirit.
[00:24:51.302 --> 00:24:53.843]  Exploration is absolutely crucial to that.
[00:24:54.203 --> 00:24:59.185]  It's satisfying the curiosity of the mind to learn new things.
[00:24:59.765 --> 00:25:04.647]  And I understand that Obama has just canceled all manned space flight for NASA.
[00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:07.208]  I mean, I think that's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:25:07.448 --> 00:25:10.149]  I remember going to NASA Cape Canaveral as a child,
[00:25:10.889 --> 00:25:15.150]  And awing at the massive structures of space.
[00:25:15.251 --> 00:25:23.273]  Exactly, but don't worry, we got $28 trillion, and we haven't got new numbers in six months, so I'm sure it's $35, $36, $37 trillion.
[00:25:23.453 --> 00:25:27.775]  $28 trillion to bankers, they won't say where it went, but we can't have $6 billion for NASA.
[00:25:28.255 --> 00:25:32.256]  I mean, it's just, again, more taxes, less services.
[00:25:32.536 --> 00:25:34.117]  We'll be back in one minute with more calls.
[00:25:34.137 --> 00:25:34.677]  Gary Franchi.

[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.901]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:05.715]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:07.195]  You want answers?
[00:27:07.956 --> 00:27:08.876]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:09.196 --> 00:27:13.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:17.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.421]  Gary Franchi is our guest.
[00:27:22.602 --> 00:27:24.443]  We're taking phone calls here.
[00:27:24.463 --> 00:27:28.604]  I've got so many calls here on my phone list.
[00:27:28.704 --> 00:27:29.745]  Who's up next, Genesis?
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.783]  Alright, Jim in West Virginia, you're on the air with Gary Franchi and Alex Jones.
[00:27:36.103 --> 00:27:37.965]  We're promoting Don't Tread On Me.
[00:27:38.485 --> 00:27:42.949]  You can watch it online at PrisonPlanet.tv or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:44.090]  He's having national screenings.
[00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.131]  Very exciting.
[00:27:46.272 --> 00:27:47.813]  Jim in West Virginia, what's on your mind?
[00:27:48.694 --> 00:27:49.234]  Hey Alex.
[00:27:50.095 --> 00:27:50.415]  Hey buddy.
[00:27:51.016 --> 00:27:52.617]  I'm definitely an Info Warrior.
[00:27:53.778 --> 00:27:57.681]  I'm thankful for listening to your show and your show being on the air.
[00:27:58.642 --> 00:27:59.423]  I'm thankful that
[00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:04.420]  You enlightened my mind and set me free of the imprisonment.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.521]  My question is, what was the website?
[00:28:07.741 --> 00:28:09.661]  Again, DontTreadOnMeWhat.com?
[00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.982]  No, it's DontTreadOnMeMovie.com, correct, Gary?
[00:28:13.442 --> 00:28:17.643]  Yeah, DontTreadOnMeMovie.com slash screening dot html.
[00:28:18.083 --> 00:28:22.244]  Absolutely, and you can also purchase the DVD discounted at Infowars.com.
[00:28:22.724 --> 00:28:23.545]  Anything else?
[00:28:23.645 --> 00:28:24.805]  Caller from West Virginia, Jim?
[00:28:25.885 --> 00:28:28.426]  That'll be it Alex, I'm thankful.
[00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.691]  Well, it's the perseverance.
[00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:51.451]  It's all going on.
[00:28:52.252 --> 00:28:55.133]  Once you learn new information, it's very hard to grasp it sometimes.
[00:28:55.693 --> 00:29:01.695]  And in my awakening, when I discovered some of your early work, it slapped me in the face.
[00:29:02.315 --> 00:29:03.996]  And I felt very alone.
[00:29:04.116 --> 00:29:04.776]  I was frightened.
[00:29:05.496 --> 00:29:11.138]  And it took a lot for me to say, OK, folks, we've got to do something about this information.
[00:29:11.438 --> 00:29:15.179]  And that's when I started my first organization, the Lowlantern Society, way back in 2005.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.122]  And five years later, you have conservatively reached tens of millions.
[00:29:22.322 --> 00:29:24.803]  Well, I certainly hope so, Alex.
[00:29:25.003 --> 00:29:25.743]  I certainly hope so.
[00:29:25.783 --> 00:29:27.064]  I mean, I can gauge it.
[00:29:27.584 --> 00:29:32.706]  Hell, our eight YouTube channels have reached over 100 million, counting my films over 200 million.
[00:29:33.026 --> 00:29:37.368]  And I can really tell you the work you've done in helping to get America freedom to fascism out to more.
[00:29:37.808 --> 00:29:39.248]  I know it's reached millions and millions.
[00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:40.689]  Thank you, Jim.
[00:29:40.769 --> 00:29:41.949]  Scott in Pennsylvania.
[00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:42.810]  Scott, you're on the air.
[00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:43.190]  Go ahead.
[00:29:48.817 --> 00:29:50.538]  Hey, Scott, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:29:50.578 --> 00:29:51.979]  How can I serve you today, Scott?
[00:29:52.679 --> 00:29:55.200]  Hey, did you ever see the movie called The Knowing or Knowing?
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.941]  Yes, people kept telling me to watch it the last year.
[00:29:57.981 --> 00:30:01.722]  I finally watched it last two weeks ago.
[00:30:01.762 --> 00:30:02.823]  I found it to be very touching.
[00:30:02.843 --> 00:30:04.804]  I've seen something on there.
[00:30:05.424 --> 00:30:06.284]  It was on YouTube.
[00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:10.406]  They had a clip of that movie where the guy is watching the news.
[00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:15.323]  And there's something on the news there about the Gulf of Mexico oil rig fire?
[00:30:15.383 --> 00:30:21.907]  Yeah, an oil rig blows up in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's one of the things that's the sign of the end of the world in the film.
[00:30:22.087 --> 00:30:24.848]  Very, very spooky, but that's probably a coincidence.
[00:30:25.309 --> 00:30:31.392]  It's not a coincidence that the CIA went to the makers of the X-Files, and so we want you to make an episode in the Lone Gunman.
[00:30:32.012 --> 00:30:42.621]  About the government hijacking a jet by remote control to blame it on Al-Qaeda to fly it into the World Trade Center and NORAD stands down because the CIA is running drills of the exact same thing happening at the exact same time.
[00:30:43.142 --> 00:30:44.403]  Now that is not a coincidence.
[00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:46.705]  Gary, why do you think they do things like that?
[00:30:47.898 --> 00:30:54.081]  Well, Alex, they need to stage events so that they can bring in their New World Order, so they can clamp down on the police state.
[00:30:54.802 --> 00:30:56.543]  It's problem, reaction, solution, Alex.
[00:30:56.923 --> 00:30:57.323]  You know that.
[00:30:57.763 --> 00:31:04.087]  But, I mean, why do you think they like to show us movies months or years before of the exact same thing they're going to do?
[00:31:04.926 --> 00:31:07.807]  Well, I think they try to preempt us.
[00:31:08.147 --> 00:31:19.051]  They want to seed our mind, condition our mind to accept these things, so that when people come forward and try to bring it up later, it can be just, you know, discounted as coincidence or conspiracy theory.
[00:31:19.864 --> 00:31:21.885]  Well, Gary, it's always fabulous to have you on.
[00:31:21.925 --> 00:31:23.546]  God bless you and we'll talk to you again soon.
[00:31:23.586 --> 00:31:25.287]  And thank you for authorizing.
[00:31:25.807 --> 00:31:26.908]  I want to thank you and William, too.
[00:31:26.928 --> 00:31:27.628]  What great guys.
[00:31:27.668 --> 00:31:28.829]  Most filmmakers aren't like that.
[00:31:30.109 --> 00:31:35.152]  To post their films on PrisonPlanet.tv so folks can see it in the highest quality online.
[00:31:35.412 --> 00:31:36.072]  Don't tread on me.
[00:31:36.133 --> 00:31:37.413]  Rise of the Republic and Camp FEMA.
[00:31:37.653 --> 00:31:44.777]  Camp FEMA went up today at PrisonPlanet.tv or get the DVD and support the filmmakers at InfoWars.com and also support us in the process.
[00:31:45.057 --> 00:31:46.138]  Gary Franchi, God bless you.
[00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:47.399]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:48.139]  You bet.
[00:31:48.499 --> 00:31:51.722]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv or order the hard copy at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:51.762 --> 00:31:53.604]  Your support makes the transmission possible.
[00:31:53.804 --> 00:31:55.525]  Bob Chapman on the economy, your calls straight ahead.
[00:31:56.386 --> 00:31:58.668]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:31:58.688 --> 00:32:00.930]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.792]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:32:04.292 --> 00:32:09.036]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:32:09.396 --> 00:32:13.580]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.224]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:32:16.244 --> 00:32:18.767]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:32:18.787 --> 00:32:21.692]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:32:22.052 --> 00:32:29.644]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:32:29.969 --> 00:32:35.274]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:32:35.354 --> 00:32:37.636]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:32:37.676 --> 00:32:41.639]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:42.820]  And I've got news for you.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.281]  You're everyone else.
[00:32:44.321 --> 00:32:45.362]  Invisible Empire.

[00:32:56.325 --> 00:32:57.946]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:57.986 --> 00:33:00.769]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:33:01.349 --> 00:33:06.273]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:33:06.553 --> 00:33:09.736]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[00:33:09.996 --> 00:33:12.338]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:33:12.978 --> 00:33:13.839]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[00:33:16.501 --> 00:33:17.441]  Take my word for it.
[00:33:17.642 --> 00:33:19.963]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:33:20.284 --> 00:33:26.508]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:33:26.809 --> 00:33:28.210]  Buy American and stay clean.
[00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.492]  As well as support InfoWars, visit 5StarsSoap.com today.
[00:33:31.612 --> 00:33:31.993]  Or call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:33:32.013 --> 00:33:33.354]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[00:33:36.616 --> 00:33:43.883]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W Dirtback.
[00:33:44.543 --> 00:33:48.287]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[00:33:48.367 --> 00:33:49.508]  Thank you!
[00:33:55.956 --> 00:34:00.818]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:34:00.919 --> 00:34:01.699]  What have we got?
[00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:04.060]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.061]  A republic.
[00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:07.942]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:34:08.022 --> 00:34:09.923]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:34:10.283 --> 00:34:12.184]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:34:12.304 --> 00:34:13.585]  So they think they own our land?
[00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.106]  They think they own our water?
[00:34:15.306 --> 00:34:15.706]  Children?
[00:34:15.906 --> 00:34:16.686]  Our education?
[00:34:17.027 --> 00:34:17.647]  Our money?
[00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:21.509]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:25.515]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:34:26.877 --> 00:34:27.678]  We have the facts.
[00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:28.980]  We have the Constitution.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.922]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:34:29.942 --> 00:34:30.763]  We have common law.
[00:34:30.843 --> 00:34:33.087]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:37.133]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:42.015]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:34:42.195 --> 00:34:43.576]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:34:43.676 --> 00:34:44.556]  Don't tread on me.
[00:34:44.776 --> 00:34:55.300]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:02.803]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:26.269]  Well, he joins us like a doctor once a week, coming in, looking at the economy, giving us his prognosis.
[00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:32.076]  And we've got the Wall Street Journal two days ago in their editorial pages saying they believe the U.S.
[00:35:32.116 --> 00:35:34.419]  will collapse by next year completely.
[00:35:34.459 --> 00:35:35.380]  Gerald Solente...
[00:35:36.604 --> 00:35:45.492]  Who's always very careful about his predictions, and I really respect his brain, and unfortunately my thought processes go along the same route.
[00:35:45.832 --> 00:35:46.853]  But I like counsel.
[00:35:47.013 --> 00:35:49.235]  I mean, I believe I'm intelligent.
[00:35:49.275 --> 00:35:53.018]  I've got a good track record of predictions and analyzing things, but there's nothing like
[00:35:54.139 --> 00:36:03.086]  Joining with other great minds, or other inquisitive minds, or other informed minds, or other curious minds, and to bounce ideas off each other.
[00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:08.691]  And we've got MSNBC saying, buy barbed wire guns, get a bunker.
[00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:10.292]  I'm not saying that.
[00:36:11.193 --> 00:36:12.293]  I'm saying 30% chance that
[00:36:16.121 --> 00:36:19.284]  That yes, in the next six months, they will call it a total collapse.
[00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:22.187]  Because they know it's already a collapse, but it's an incremental collapse.
[00:36:22.427 --> 00:36:27.953]  And they've been lying to you, we've been telling you this for a decade, since they passed Glass-Steagall, that it was designed to destroy.
[00:36:27.993 --> 00:36:34.639]  I mean, I had George Humphrey on here 11 years ago, before they passed Glass-Steagall, talking about it.
[00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:35.640]  He's an economist.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.062]  But not just an economist, he's a successful businessman.
[00:36:38.503 --> 00:36:39.203]  Very successful.
[00:36:39.804 --> 00:36:42.104]  I'm not going to go into it, but he's a successful businessman.
[00:36:42.425 --> 00:36:45.265]  That's the proof he's also smart, knows what he's doing on his own.
[00:36:45.765 --> 00:36:52.447]  And he made films, made books, wrote books, made audio cassettes about it, about derivatives.
[00:36:52.467 --> 00:36:53.547]  That's who I learned about it from.
[00:36:54.487 --> 00:36:59.068]  Separately, Bob Chapman was writing about it at the same time, learned about it from him the last 14 years.
[00:37:00.148 --> 00:37:02.429]  But we knew what this was going to do.
[00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:05.871]  I mean, what does a black hole do in the middle of a galaxy?
[00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:07.112]  It sucks the galaxy in.
[00:37:08.012 --> 00:37:10.674]  What does jumping off a thousand foot cliff with no parachute do?
[00:37:10.734 --> 00:37:11.814]  It kills you, deader than a hammer.
[00:37:12.935 --> 00:37:15.797]  What does shooting yourself in the head with a .357 Magnum in the temple do?
[00:37:15.837 --> 00:37:16.998]  It pretty much kills you.
[00:37:17.578 --> 00:37:18.499]  Or you're going to be brain dead.
[00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:20.820]  Uh, we know what's happening.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.961]  We know they engineered it.
[00:37:22.061 --> 00:37:34.110]  But, the intel we've gotten from Bilderberg Group now, from our sources, Skelton's sources, Tucker's sources and others, is that they are dejected, they've got their world government, it is imploding economies, but...
[00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.031]  It's gotten out of control.
[00:37:36.331 --> 00:37:42.074]  Like the Bible says, to paraphrase, that your enemy will dig a pit for you and they will fall into it.
[00:37:42.414 --> 00:37:57.223]  Yes, they've got all these trillions of made-up fiat dollars and other currencies, euros, you name it, but the world is realizing the scam that if we let the fractional system get us and put us in this
[00:37:57.683 --> 00:38:00.285]  False debt, that we are going to be slaves.
[00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:07.169]  With massive 80% tax rates, that's what the OECD calls for in Europe, for the United States, global minimalization of taxes.
[00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:12.592]  That if we give in to this, we'll have almost no services and nothing but taxes.
[00:38:13.052 --> 00:38:18.596]  That's the equation of the debt money system and what the new order does.
[00:38:18.676 --> 00:38:20.957]  And so, their entire program is in trouble.
[00:38:21.237 --> 00:38:23.359]  Not just a month ago, Zbigniew Brzezinski,
[00:38:24.522 --> 00:38:25.684]  Man, that's already a month ago.
[00:38:26.004 --> 00:38:30.030]  At the CFR saying for the first time the whole world is awake to world government.
[00:38:31.252 --> 00:38:32.133]  And that we're in trouble.
[00:38:33.066 --> 00:38:34.567]  I mean, he's having to ring the alarm.
[00:38:34.987 --> 00:38:35.647]  Battle stations!
[00:38:35.687 --> 00:38:36.307]  Battle stations!
[00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:37.608]  We've sustained serious hits!
[00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:38.528]  The enemy is on us!
[00:38:38.888 --> 00:38:40.169]  Emergency battle stations!
[00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:40.949]  Battle stations!
[00:38:41.009 --> 00:38:43.270]  I mean, uh, we are in deep danger!
[00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:44.891]  We could be completely destroyed!
[00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:47.852]  We need the maximum effort from our new order operatives everywhere!
[00:38:47.872 --> 00:38:54.295]  I mean, they've now had you get to the point of being honest, and you watch the CFR people, they're all gulping, all... What?
[00:38:54.675 --> 00:38:56.936]  You mean I can't be an arrogant control freak?
[00:38:56.956 --> 00:38:59.317]  Uh, so...
[00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:01.553]  They're more dangerous than ever, though.
[00:39:01.573 --> 00:39:03.194]  They want to start World War III with Iran.
[00:39:03.214 --> 00:39:04.894]  That's on the front burner from Bilderberg.
[00:39:06.794 --> 00:39:07.634]  But they're in trouble.
[00:39:07.674 --> 00:39:08.735]  They're not invincible.
[00:39:08.775 --> 00:39:14.876]  So right now, the destiny of the world, or the next phase of our history, is being decided.
[00:39:15.336 --> 00:39:27.458]  And I want to go to Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster, one of the best analysts we've got, one of the best track records of prediction, because Gerald Solente says he believes we will collapse in the next six months.
[00:39:28.686 --> 00:39:31.428]  He says Europe's going to collapse, we're going to collapse the next six.
[00:39:31.648 --> 00:39:37.252]  I haven't really seen Gerald be wrong, and that's probably the boldest statement I've ever heard out of him.
[00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:41.714]  Man, I hope that's not the case, and I hope it isn't self-fulfilling either.
[00:39:44.296 --> 00:39:52.460]  Again, what's been put in motion is so much bigger than me or Gerald or Bob or Ron Paul that, you know, we would kid ourselves saying that a pronouncement like that could trigger it.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:40:11.768]  Clearly all that is in train, but I want to get Bob Chapman's view on what Salente said here two days ago and how the media has shifted from saying, it's a wonderful economy, everything's fine, to basically head for the hills, abandon ship, it's over, you know, every man for himself.
[00:40:11.828 --> 00:40:12.388]  Bob Chapman.
[00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:20.564]  Well, it's very, very difficult in these times to make predictions except for longer term ones.
[00:40:21.665 --> 00:40:26.106]  And Gerald could very well be right.
[00:40:27.987 --> 00:40:34.770]  I think the underlying sovereign debt problem is really insurmountable.
[00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:42.273]  And the German Supreme Court just said in the challenge by the professors who have challenged this
[00:40:43.556 --> 00:40:45.277]  Supreme Court in Germany before that.
[00:40:46.157 --> 00:40:51.499]  It's okay for Germany to help all these countries out, even though it violates the Constitution.
[00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:52.099]  They don't care.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.720]  It's like our Supreme Court.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.760]  They do what they want to do.
[00:40:55.821 --> 00:41:05.665]  And I just got a letter from a reporter in Germany and said, what do you think of that?
[00:41:06.745 --> 00:41:08.606]  I said, well, it's to be expected.
[00:41:09.486 --> 00:41:11.447]  And this really is part of the answer.
[00:41:12.515 --> 00:41:20.083]  And I think that about 63% of the people in the country don't want to be in the European Union.
[00:41:20.763 --> 00:41:24.707]  About 70% on average don't want the Euro.
[00:41:25.748 --> 00:41:34.697]  And now you tell them that you're going to have to spend hundreds of billions of your tax dollars in order to pay off the bankers.
[00:41:36.338 --> 00:41:45.508]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the bailouts go out to the bankers to bail them out, and then they loan our money back to us.
[00:41:45.708 --> 00:41:55.038]  And of course, those are Cook numbers that 80% or more of England wants out of the Euro, because they were never allowed to have a vote on being brought into it, even though they're not officially in it.
[00:41:55.938 --> 00:41:58.819]  It's way over 63% of the Germans that are mad.
[00:41:58.839 --> 00:42:00.219]  We know those are even cooked polls.
[00:42:00.239 --> 00:42:03.220]  It's probably more like 85% from the numbers I've seen.
[00:42:04.381 --> 00:42:12.203]  But regardless, I mean, as Zbigniew Brzezinski said, the true nature of the world system is now becoming evident.
[00:42:13.543 --> 00:42:14.604]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:42:14.664 --> 00:42:19.485]  So, yes, the sovereign debt problem is going to continue.
[00:42:19.845 --> 00:42:25.207]  There's 20 countries which are on the edge and Iceland, for all intents and purposes, is under.
[00:42:26.235 --> 00:42:30.817]  And so, that's an underlying deflationary factor.
[00:42:32.498 --> 00:42:47.725]  During the past 14 months, Europe, UK, United States have reduced their money in credit from a plus 18% on average, down to about a minus 5.9% at least in the United States.
[00:42:48.246 --> 00:42:50.226]  So they all did the same thing at the same time.
[00:42:50.627 --> 00:42:52.207]  So obviously it was coordinated.
[00:42:53.188 --> 00:42:55.469]  And, except for bailing banks out,
[00:42:56.273 --> 00:43:04.696]  Very little money has gone anywhere except for the stimulus plans that were put in place in many of the countries involved in Europe and England and the United States.
[00:43:05.536 --> 00:43:10.617]  Now, the effect of these stimulus plans is wearing off.
[00:43:11.658 --> 00:43:22.981]  Now, the big question is, and this comes back to what Gerald had to say in his projection, it all depends on which way they go.
[00:43:24.462 --> 00:43:25.482]  If they come back in,
[00:43:26.129 --> 00:43:31.472]  And they say, oh my goodness gracious, we must have another $800 billion in stimulus.
[00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:42.079]  And the Fed has to create another $1.5 trillion so that we can go sideways for another year, a year and a half.
[00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:47.803]  If they do that, then you're not going to get a collapse before the end of the year.
[00:43:48.543 --> 00:43:51.185]  You're going to get it in about a year, maybe a year and a half.
[00:43:51.765 --> 00:43:54.587]  If they don't do that, then I think
[00:43:55.868 --> 00:44:06.577]  That what'll happen in the European Union is that one by one, these countries will fall away from the Euro that are in trouble.
[00:44:07.258 --> 00:44:14.864]  We know who they are, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Spain.
[00:44:15.925 --> 00:44:18.928]  And they'll just drop out, and they'll go back to their own currencies.
[00:44:18.948 --> 00:44:23.492]  Now, we have two subscribers in Athens.
[00:44:24.674 --> 00:44:28.075]  And, um, they're wealthy, extremely wealthy people.
[00:44:29.436 --> 00:44:31.716]  And, uh, the least that I hear from, anyway.
[00:44:32.556 --> 00:44:36.138]  And they, they both say that they, independently, they don't know each other.
[00:44:36.818 --> 00:44:38.558]  That the drachma's already been printed.
[00:44:39.779 --> 00:44:50.542]  Now, how true that is, I don't know, but, you know, these people are subsistence... Well, why are a lot of the British elites telling, uh, the, uh, Greeks to pull out in the default?
[00:44:52.645 --> 00:44:53.409]  Can't answer that.
[00:44:53.711 --> 00:44:55.519]  I don't know what the thinking behind that is.
[00:44:56.076 --> 00:45:01.318]  Maybe they're reading my publication and listening to me on the radio and television over there, along with you.
[00:45:01.998 --> 00:45:07.861]  But anyway... But there's no way to bail it... I mean, there's no way to not default.
[00:45:08.261 --> 00:45:13.663]  I mean, technically, these countries can pay the trillions up to the bankers on the magic derivatives they were sold.
[00:45:14.183 --> 00:45:20.306]  But at the end of the day, still, that just devalues the euro and causes inflation.
[00:45:20.686 --> 00:45:22.347]  And so either way, it wrecks the economy.
[00:45:23.007 --> 00:45:23.488]  I don't know.
[00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:56.254]  I mean, now I see it in the German news, the French news, the British news, they're announcing, we're taking your Social Security, we're cutting it, we're cutting your pensions, we're raising your taxes, and of course Europe isn't going to go along with this, so these private bankers can get hundreds of billions of dollars in bonuses.
[00:45:56.314 --> 00:46:03.957]  I mean, this is really, and I think that's why Bilderberg is so scared, Bob, and I'm really worried about what Bilderberg's going to do.
[00:46:04.017 --> 00:46:05.697]  I think they're going to start World War III.
[00:46:05.717 --> 00:46:08.578]  I think before the collapse comes, they're going to launch World War III.
[00:46:09.966 --> 00:46:11.187]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:46:11.788 --> 00:46:12.929]  And that's another factor.
[00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.772]  But going back, it all depends on which way they approach it.
[00:46:16.933 --> 00:46:22.238]  Ultimately, we know that no matter what they do, this whole thing's going into a great dark pit.
[00:46:23.278 --> 00:46:27.282]  In fact, I applied yesterday to be a pit helper, per the Bible.
[00:46:27.983 --> 00:46:28.984]  And it's supposed to be a joke.
[00:46:29.424 --> 00:46:29.965]  But anyway...
[00:46:31.016 --> 00:46:32.317]  Oh, thank you for laughing.
[00:46:32.737 --> 00:46:34.217]  No, it took me a minute to get it, Bob.
[00:46:34.297 --> 00:46:36.718]  It's like I'm always in... Hey, stay there.
[00:46:36.938 --> 00:46:39.639]  Let's come back and let you talk about... Okay.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:44.541]  Hypothetically, within Gerald Salente's mode, I should have asked Gerald, why do you think we're collapsing?
[00:46:44.561 --> 00:46:47.742]  I mean, he did say, he said, we're tapped out, we're bankrupt, everything's falling apart.
[00:46:48.563 --> 00:46:50.624]  You know, even new stimulus won't work.
[00:46:50.664 --> 00:46:55.265]  But, I mean, let's try to look at the short-term collapse versus the long-term collapse.
[00:46:55.305 --> 00:46:56.706]  Different scenarios with Bob Chapman.
[00:46:59.144 --> 00:47:00.265]  This is not a drill.
[00:47:00.365 --> 00:47:02.326]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:47:02.867 --> 00:47:04.488]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:11.913]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:47:11.993 --> 00:47:16.356]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:47:16.396 --> 00:47:18.918]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[00:47:18.998 --> 00:47:21.780]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.500]  How to create the
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.641]  The perfect hiding place.
[00:47:23.741 --> 00:47:26.742]  As well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:47:26.863 --> 00:47:28.443]  Under any circumstance.
[00:47:28.503 --> 00:47:35.407]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:47:35.748 --> 00:47:36.468]  But listen up.
[00:47:36.508 --> 00:47:42.632]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.

[00:47:58.433 --> 00:48:04.155]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:48:04.875 --> 00:48:09.316]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[00:48:10.157 --> 00:48:23.721]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Zee, Doug Casey, David McIlvaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[00:48:24.481 --> 00:48:28.923]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[00:48:44.211 --> 00:48:46.412]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[00:48:46.432 --> 00:48:47.072]  fallofamerica.net.
[00:48:56.952 --> 00:49:06.679]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:49:06.959 --> 00:49:13.023]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:49:13.403 --> 00:49:22.249]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:49:22.629 --> 00:49:31.536]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:49:31.817 --> 00:49:36.420]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:49:36.881 --> 00:49:37.982]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:49:38.222 --> 00:49:40.724]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:49:41.004 --> 00:49:43.967]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[00:49:49.251 --> 00:49:49.591]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:00.172]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:50:00.252 --> 00:50:02.213]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:50:02.313 --> 00:50:04.975]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:50:05.075 --> 00:50:07.016]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:50:07.296 --> 00:50:08.497]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:50:08.717 --> 00:50:10.599]  But first, the facts.
[00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:12.340]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.261]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:50:14.541 --> 00:50:18.003]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:50:18.224 --> 00:50:25.608]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:50:25.968 --> 00:50:26.569]  Sinofresh.
[00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:29.711]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:47.700]  It works!
[00:51:12.895 --> 00:51:14.056]  Bob Shatman's our guest.
[00:51:14.096 --> 00:51:17.799]  I'm gonna hit a bunch of news articles, get his take on it, and talk to all these callers.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:30.751]  In fact, just give me a fresh phone list, Genesis, go through them, make sure everybody's there, and also on my phone system, and I'll try to just rattle through a bunch of calls in the next segment, because I want to hear from you on the oil spill, the economy, all of it.
[00:51:31.612 --> 00:51:35.115]  Bob, you heard my question going to break, but to recap it for those that joined us,
[00:51:36.223 --> 00:51:37.163]  Those are just tuned in.
[00:51:38.684 --> 00:51:41.344]  Short-term collapse versus long-term collapse.
[00:51:42.204 --> 00:51:44.485]  Any way you slice it, there's no way out.
[00:51:45.345 --> 00:51:46.646]  This plane's going down.
[00:51:46.686 --> 00:51:48.846]  The question is, do we get our landing gear down?
[00:51:48.866 --> 00:51:54.367]  And as Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, former head of the Treasury, said, there's probably no way to even get the landing gear down.
[00:51:54.387 --> 00:52:04.850]  Well, I think it all depends on what they do with the money supply in Europe, England, the United States, and the creation of
[00:52:05.757 --> 00:52:27.612]  Liquidity and if they continue to do what they are, which is tightening, we will shortly go into a deflationary depression, which means interest rates will probably rise in the real market because everything that is in the bond market will become somewhat suspect and the stock market will go down.
[00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:32.715]  I think there's a good chance before the year is out, a very good chance that
[00:52:34.402 --> 00:52:39.424]  6,650 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average can be tested.
[00:52:39.444 --> 00:52:41.665]  I think we're around 10-2 right now.
[00:52:42.565 --> 00:52:45.986]  And that was the low that we experienced a year ago in March.
[00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:51.028]  And incidentally, we called that at 6,600 and we're very proud of that.
[00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:57.751]  And then again, that could break and move down to 4,000.
[00:52:59.031 --> 00:53:01.672]  And I think eventually next year is going to be a horrible year.
[00:53:02.495 --> 00:53:10.918]  And I think next year, the market could get down to the 28 to 3,200 area on the Dow.
[00:53:11.919 --> 00:53:15.500]  And Richard Russell's calling for 1,000, so I feel very conservative.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:21.702]  And so that sort of goes along with what Gerald had to say.
[00:53:21.722 --> 00:53:28.305]  It's just that my timing, I just don't know what it is until they commit themselves.
[00:53:29.125 --> 00:53:31.006]  And we'll find that out over the next month or two.
[00:53:31.764 --> 00:53:36.366]  And if they're looking to have a deflationary depression, this is the spot to do it.
[00:53:36.426 --> 00:53:40.268]  And if it works for them, if they can put all their programs in place.
[00:53:40.668 --> 00:53:41.488]  Well, let's go back.
[00:53:41.508 --> 00:53:52.693]  I mean, let's go back to 19 months ago with the October 2008 banker takeover, known as the banker bailout bill, that was supposedly for subprime mortgages.
[00:53:52.773 --> 00:53:58.516]  And then the October 4th, the day after they passed it, Paulson said, I'm not going to tell you where we're spending it.
[00:53:58.816 --> 00:54:00.037]  None of it's going to mortgages.
[00:54:01.858 --> 00:54:10.546]  If we go back then, they used psychological terrorism to drive the market down almost 1,000 points to create fear to get their agenda through.
[00:54:10.906 --> 00:54:18.173]  And so we've seen that their signifying that we're really in a depression causes it to deepen because of the destruction of confidence.
[00:54:18.593 --> 00:54:22.016]  And so I see them trying to prop it up into the election.
[00:54:22.777 --> 00:54:39.687]  And then into the new year, and I tend to disagree with Gerald a little bit, I think he's right overall, I believe they're going to announce, if I had to do a dead reckoning, this isn't a prediction, just if I had to put a date on it, I would imagine that by April of next year, they're going to start admitting we're in a depression.
[00:54:39.927 --> 00:54:40.488]  Bob Chapman.
[00:54:42.189 --> 00:54:47.672]  I think that if they're not going to do the stimulus that I said that they would have to do,
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:55:11.196]  They're then going to have to admit it's a double-dip recession, as they would call it, when in fact it's a continuation of a still inflationary depression until the system starts to really break down, and that would be April of next year that you're talking about, and that would take the market down to the levels that I and others have talked about.
[00:55:11.216 --> 00:55:13.298]  They're still avoiding it.
[00:55:14.058 --> 00:55:16.220]  I think, you know, the simple way to handle this
[00:55:16.758 --> 00:55:26.585]  From a personal perspective is, you know, you get in your food and your filter and be ready to defend yourself and your gold and silver coins.
[00:55:27.426 --> 00:55:33.390]  And the only place that you can have any safety is in gold and silver related assets.
[00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:34.771]  There's no other place.
[00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:37.733]  And so the formula is very simple.
[00:55:38.253 --> 00:55:39.234]  And that's what you've got to do.
[00:55:39.254 --> 00:55:41.435]  You've got to get out of the stock market, out of bonds.
[00:55:42.056 --> 00:55:43.777]  And I just wrote an article on Wednesday.
[00:55:44.338 --> 00:55:46.299]  People should start phasing out of
[00:55:46.775 --> 00:55:53.678]  They're IRAs and other vehicles that are retirement vehicles, if they can.
[00:55:55.438 --> 00:56:02.001]  This year, next year and the year after, a lot of people who I've talked to are saying, no, I'm going to do it all right now.
[00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:03.121]  And that's fine.
[00:56:03.201 --> 00:56:04.382]  It's just that the tax hit.
[00:56:04.913 --> 00:56:09.976]  Is bigger this year to be paid in April than it might be otherwise.
[00:56:10.196 --> 00:56:27.247]  And of course the loss in confidence because people are being forced to lose confidence and gold going up is accelerating this and even the New York Times two days ago admitted that gold going up is really putting the central banks in a bad place showing that all their paper just can't compete with the real metal.
[00:56:28.248 --> 00:56:28.648]  That's right.
[00:56:30.558 --> 00:56:36.220]  All right, Bob, let's take calls from a bunch of people when we get back, and I'll get into some other issues with Bob Chapman.
[00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:41.262]  The good news is the boat is heading to Team Sailor Drifting in Indian Ocean.
[00:56:41.743 --> 00:56:44.764]  I've also got some more words on this valiant young lady straight ahead.
[00:56:47.105 --> 00:56:48.025]  We're on the march.
[00:56:48.486 --> 00:56:50.086]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:51.027 --> 00:56:53.708]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:56.294 --> 00:57:00.536]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:00.857 --> 00:57:01.117]  Number 1.
[00:57:01.757 --> 00:57:04.919]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:05.179 --> 00:57:05.739]  Number 2.
[00:57:06.039 --> 00:57:10.602]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:10.942 --> 00:57:11.382]  It's true.
[00:57:11.683 --> 00:57:16.245]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:16.545 --> 00:57:17.086]  Number 3.
[00:57:17.386 --> 00:57:20.668]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:20.968 --> 00:57:24.670]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:25.410]  Number 4.
[00:57:25.671 --> 00:57:28.032]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:28.413 --> 00:57:31.815]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:32.095 --> 00:57:32.315]  Number 5.
[00:57:32.896 --> 00:57:36.818]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:37.039 --> 00:57:41.802]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:57:42.082 --> 00:57:46.107]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:58:56.581 --> 00:58:59.182]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:04.564]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:04.924 --> 00:59:06.644]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:06.965 --> 00:59:11.786]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:11.966 --> 00:59:12.927]  How much do you want?
[00:59:13.147 --> 00:59:13.887]  When do you want it?
[00:59:14.287 --> 00:59:15.869]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:16.149 --> 00:59:16.990]  When will you need it?
[00:59:17.231 --> 00:59:19.313]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:19.453 --> 00:59:20.535]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:20.775 --> 00:59:22.117]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:22.317 --> 00:59:27.383]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:27.583 --> 00:59:30.707]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:31.147 --> 00:59:34.648]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:34.968 --> 00:59:35.949]  How much will you need?
[00:59:36.189 --> 00:59:36.809]  We don't know.
[00:59:37.089 --> 00:59:38.009]  How much do you want?
[00:59:38.209 --> 00:59:38.930]  All you can get.
[00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:39.970]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:42.991]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:43.271 --> 00:59:45.032]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:45.052 --> 00:59:45.972]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:00:00.077 --> 01:00:00.719]  We're good.
[01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:20.510]  We're going back to Bob Chapman and your calls, then their maiden voyage on our radio broadcast.
[01:00:21.331 --> 01:00:29.279]  We're going to have the folks from Free Talk Live on talking about the oil spill, the libertarian view on borders, and your phone calls as well.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:39.849]  I know the economy is shot to kingdom come, but it is important, it is very important,
[01:00:45.387 --> 01:00:52.353]  It is very, very important to support local affiliates.
[01:00:53.234 --> 01:00:55.676]  It is important to support their local sponsors.
[01:00:56.237 --> 01:00:59.760]  Very courageous radio stations pick up this broadcast.
[01:01:01.176 --> 01:01:04.219]  And we're getting a lot of new affiliates.
[01:01:04.979 --> 01:01:07.301]  And people have never really heard talk like this before.
[01:01:07.321 --> 01:01:08.702]  I mean, they've never heard the truth.
[01:01:08.722 --> 01:01:10.103]  Because we lay it out.
[01:01:10.143 --> 01:01:11.044]  We've done the research.
[01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.065]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.666]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:01:13.826 --> 01:01:14.827]  I wish we were wrong.
[01:01:15.328 --> 01:01:17.289]  I wish that we didn't know what we're talking about.
[01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:19.231]  But we're telling you like it is.
[01:01:19.931 --> 01:01:20.171]  Okay?
[01:01:20.191 --> 01:01:21.893]  We're free agents for freedom.
[01:01:22.981 --> 01:01:32.869]  We're here trying to preserve our future, trying to preserve our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our nation, our free planet, where our children live.
[01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:40.235]  And I want you to know that it is so important to support local AMNFM sponsors.
[01:01:40.815 --> 01:01:46.080]  And if you are a local listener who has a business, to support the stations you're listening to right now.
[01:01:48.541 --> 01:01:51.304]  I don't care if they're a big commercial station, you send them a donation.
[01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:57.705]  Like a lot of stations that pick us up, who are commercial stations, are like, I've never gotten a donation before.
[01:01:58.085 --> 01:02:00.527]  Well that's because people that are smart appreciate this info.
[01:02:02.169 --> 01:02:03.930]  And also support our national sponsors.
[01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.553]  Because I'll tell you, other media is imploding.
[01:02:07.613 --> 01:02:13.697]  Not just newspapers, not just national television, but also
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:16.441]  Even talk radio.
[01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:23.965]  Though statistically, talk radio has the best response, bang for the buck, in every study I've seen.
[01:02:24.045 --> 01:02:25.926]  Not studies put out by talk radio industry.
[01:02:26.267 --> 01:02:29.589]  You can go out and research real marketing analysis, talk radio,
[01:02:31.283 --> 01:02:38.006]  Especially conservative, libertarian, patriot, whatever you want to call it, is the cheapest advertising for the response.
[01:02:38.346 --> 01:02:43.688]  But even in this shot, economy, even talk radio is having a lot of problems.
[01:02:43.748 --> 01:02:49.311]  Even Limbaugh and others have had problems compared to their past because the country is shutting down.
[01:02:50.111 --> 01:02:52.313]  We've also got the government coming in wanting to censor.
[01:02:52.773 --> 01:03:02.201]  There's some good headlines today about the Federal Trade Commission now backing off, at least for now, their calls to tax talk radio and restrict free speech, but they'll be back.
[01:03:03.142 --> 01:03:11.550]  And so, going into this storm, it is important to financially support talk radio and alternative internet websites and news and information.
[01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:26.603]  And so I would challenge you to not just support our local AM and FM affiliate sponsors, but to support our sponsors nationally, and to also buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the materials that we offer on InfoWars.com, because we are financed by you.
[01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:35.970]  Plus, these are the best films out there and are riveting, are informative, and are some of the most effective tools out there in waking people up.
[01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:42.455]  So whether it's Don't Tread on Me, or Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, or Police Day for the Rise of FEMA.
[01:03:43.055 --> 01:03:45.276]  You can watch them all in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:45.316 --> 01:03:49.418]  You can share your passcode with friends, up to six different people.
[01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:53.580]  Fifteen cents a day, that finances our IT and our expensive bandwidth.
[01:03:53.961 --> 01:03:56.662]  You can buy the high quality DVDs, make copies of them.
[01:03:57.082 --> 01:04:06.147]  It is your purchase of the books, of the t-shirts, of the videos, of the pocket constitutions, that makes this broadcast possible, and we couldn't do it without you.
[01:04:06.687 --> 01:04:09.589]  And I'm in a better position than pretty much anybody in the media.
[01:04:10.737 --> 01:04:14.621]  Statistically, from what I've seen, you know, we're in the top three or four percent of success.
[01:04:15.141 --> 01:04:17.523]  We're doubling our audience conservatively every year.
[01:04:17.543 --> 01:04:19.125]  That's not just me.
[01:04:19.145 --> 01:04:21.267]  That's Talkers Magazine and Radio Inc.
[01:04:21.347 --> 01:04:31.436]  and Alexa and Shoutcast and the Washington Post called me, you know, the incredibly influential Alex Jones two days ago, which I don't even like that, particularly being in the paper.
[01:04:31.456 --> 01:04:33.117]  I always wanted to sneak up on these people.
[01:04:33.417 --> 01:04:34.779]  I've known the effect we're having.
[01:04:35.387 --> 01:04:44.755]  I mean, folks, I can get off a plane in Chicago or New York or Honduras and every five or six people I walk past stop and are fans of the show, fans of Liberty.
[01:04:44.975 --> 01:04:45.956]  And it's exponential!
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:51.403]  You know, I could have the number two guy in the Japanese government on the show saying 9-11's an inside job.
[01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:58.186]  I could have the former German defense minister on, the former head of German intelligence on, who's a listener and who's talking about world government.
[01:04:58.987 --> 01:05:02.689]  You know, we're, for whatever reason, I think it's because I'm real.
[01:05:02.709 --> 01:05:03.830]  And we're going back to Bob Chapman.
[01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.850]  I mean, I'm real.
[01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.152]  I listen to my show sometimes and I can't listen to it.
[01:05:09.574 --> 01:05:19.762]  Comes off obnoxious sometimes, bumbling, whatever, but there are those kernels of, you know, true enlightenment or understanding with the guests, the callers, myself.
[01:05:20.803 --> 01:05:21.724]  It's real, though.
[01:05:21.804 --> 01:05:23.105]  That's why we've had success.
[01:05:24.286 --> 01:05:27.148]  But let me tell you, I know the economy's shot.
[01:05:27.168 --> 01:05:31.512]  If we're doubling our audience exponentially the last three years, and our revenue's down from a year ago.
[01:05:32.967 --> 01:05:39.672]  I mean, I can tell you right now, folks, that most companies have lost market share, and so they are just fried.
[01:05:39.712 --> 01:05:42.194]  They're losing viewers and listeners.
[01:05:42.254 --> 01:05:44.576]  Can you imagine what their bottom line's like?
[01:05:45.056 --> 01:05:49.660]  So it is also important to support us as well here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:06:01.769]  Now, I'm going to plug a sponsor and then go back to Bob Chapman, because I forgot for two hours and 38 minutes to plug any sponsors, and I need to tell you about some of the folks that made today's broadcast possible.
[01:06:03.127 --> 01:06:05.489]  One of the sponsors is Pure Water Freedom.
[01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:07.750]  I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:08.291]  That's one word.
[01:06:08.311 --> 01:06:11.953]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:06:11.973 --> 01:06:16.016]  They have all of the wonderful household line of fluoride filters you need.
[01:06:16.036 --> 01:06:20.660]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.263]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from the water, including shower bath filters.
[01:06:25.563 --> 01:06:26.463]  No, I think it's scoped out.
[01:06:26.484 --> 01:06:29.565]  We just don't know the regularity or irregularity of how it's going to happen.
[01:06:55.858 --> 01:07:00.322]  But it's going to be an end result, and it's just too hard to call.
[01:07:00.802 --> 01:07:12.533]  We all know the direction, and so anybody who makes a prediction shouldn't be held too hard to it, like Gerald, because if it doesn't happen that way, because it's so, so hard to call.
[01:07:13.479 --> 01:07:17.140]  Yeah, it's like saying, well, you know, we've had five days of solid rain.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.121]  We're in southern Peru.
[01:07:19.141 --> 01:07:21.101]  We always have mudslides.
[01:07:21.141 --> 01:07:23.342]  It looks like that mountaintop's about to go.
[01:07:23.362 --> 01:07:26.963]  You know, is it going to fall the next five minutes or about tomorrow morning?
[01:07:27.323 --> 01:07:30.364]  You don't know, but you get up in the morning and the mountainside has collapsed.
[01:07:30.444 --> 01:07:31.244]  It's going to happen.
[01:07:33.157 --> 01:07:33.597]  That's right.
[01:07:34.138 --> 01:07:40.223]  Alright, let's go to Anti-Federalist on our home phones, because again we're taking phone calls on both phone systems.
[01:07:41.004 --> 01:07:43.266]  Anti-Federalist from Georgia, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:07:45.147 --> 01:07:51.112]  Hey guys, I'm going to play a clip for you from John King USA from Wednesday.
[01:07:51.433 --> 01:07:57.498]  And the speakers here is a guy named Cornell Belcher and a Republican guy named Rich Galen.
[01:07:57.538 --> 01:07:58.679]  It has to do with Obama.
[01:08:01.889 --> 01:08:03.269]  Yeah, that's a good clip.
[01:08:03.509 --> 01:08:03.910]  I like it.
[01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:09.171]  What else does he have to say?
[01:08:15.653 --> 01:08:18.193]  See, I don't want to be anti-federalist.
[01:08:19.153 --> 01:08:20.674]  Here's the problem with people playing clips.
[01:08:21.987 --> 01:08:23.889]  I'm not trying to be mean, but I dread it.
[01:08:24.249 --> 01:08:26.691]  It's better just to tell us about the clip and then we can grab it.
[01:08:27.172 --> 01:08:30.454]  Because sometimes people know how to put the phone up to the speaker where I can hear it.
[01:08:30.835 --> 01:08:32.576]  No one can hear that Anti-Federalist.
[01:08:33.217 --> 01:08:34.598]  I wonder if Anti-Federalist is even there.
[01:08:34.638 --> 01:08:35.719]  He's probably still listening to the clip.
[01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:37.060]  Anti-Federalist, are you there?
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.141]  I am here.
[01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:38.961]  Yes, I am here.
[01:08:39.001 --> 01:08:41.323]  Yeah, we couldn't hear... I apologize for the bad audio.
[01:08:41.363 --> 01:08:42.884]  We couldn't hear Jack Diddley's spot.
[01:08:42.944 --> 01:08:43.705]  No problem.
[01:08:43.945 --> 01:08:45.407]  Okay, well, what did they say?
[01:08:46.668 --> 01:08:46.988]  Okay.
[01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:49.430]  Rich Galen
[01:08:50.433 --> 01:08:52.563]  Hold on one second Alex, I have...
[01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:57.010]  We can't.
[01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.633]  Anti-Federalists, now we can't even hear you.
[01:08:59.933 --> 01:09:00.814]  I'm not going to be able to do this.
[01:09:00.874 --> 01:09:01.715]  I appreciate your call.
[01:09:01.735 --> 01:09:03.336]  I mean, we've got wide open phones.
[01:09:03.376 --> 01:09:04.197]  We don't screen calls.
[01:09:04.217 --> 01:09:05.799]  But folks, you've got to have the phone.
[01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:06.579]  You've got to be ready.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.922]  Sometimes I almost don't even want to take calls anymore.
[01:09:08.942 --> 01:09:12.445]  Or just take calls when I'm taking calls.
[01:09:12.525 --> 01:09:14.347]  Because that was just a complete disaster.
[01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:15.468]  It just went on and on and on.
[01:09:15.808 --> 01:09:16.669]  And then I'm the bad guy.
[01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:17.710]  I like Anti-Federalists.
[01:09:17.730 --> 01:09:18.691]  I'm sure he's a nice person.
[01:09:19.512 --> 01:09:20.653]  And I want to hear what you had to say.
[01:09:22.194 --> 01:09:23.615]  It's just, it's never ending.
[01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:26.017]  Bobby in California, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:26.678]  Let's try you.
[01:09:28.219 --> 01:09:29.300]  Yeah, look, it's true.
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.481]  They're typing, BPA contaminating our food.
[01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:39.788]  It's on a Fox News clip where they admit that BPA was actually considered a form of female estrogen to be used in pills back in the 1930s.
[01:09:40.328 --> 01:09:43.791]  Alright, I heard something about female estrogen there.
[01:09:44.531 --> 01:09:45.352]  Your phone's low.
[01:09:45.372 --> 01:09:51.697]  No, there's a Fox News clip that's titled, BPA contaminating our food.
[01:09:52.208 --> 01:09:59.913]  And they admit that BPA was considered to be used as a female hormone in the 1930s as an estrogen pill.
[01:10:00.233 --> 01:10:06.977]  And they show how all our tin cans and all the drink cans and food cans are all lined with BPA.
[01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:10.419]  And it's at an unbelievable high level.
[01:10:11.434 --> 01:10:15.079]  Yes sir, we talked about this over a decade ago and we're called Kooks.
[01:10:15.659 --> 01:10:19.064]  There are thousands of different permutations and different types of plastic.
[01:10:19.364 --> 01:10:28.475]  They chose one family of plastics that actually even cost more than a lot of the other formulas made out of petroleum that leaks
[01:10:29.216 --> 01:10:29.296]  I'm
[01:10:49.096 --> 01:10:55.580]  Biologically, they don't look like the breasts of a 70-year-old, but the hormonal exchanges have worn the cell DNA out to the point of a 70-year-old.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:02.084]  And so, you know, your 8-year-old goes into puberty when she's a girl, and your boy looks like a girl and acts like a girl, because they are a girl.
[01:11:02.404 --> 01:11:08.068]  I mean, you can feed estrogen to a bull, and it'll act like a cow.
[01:11:08.388 --> 01:11:11.150]  In fact, it'll even go present itself to another bull to be mounted.
[01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.371]  Because it's got a similar brain.
[01:11:13.771 --> 01:11:17.192]  And so yes, and that's one reason you can't really blame a lot of these people that are gay.
[01:11:17.893 --> 01:11:19.733]  People love to hate them and say kill them and stuff.
[01:11:20.013 --> 01:11:22.234]  I think it's a destructive lifestyle, but I don't hate these people.
[01:11:22.434 --> 01:11:26.056]  But the reason there's so many gay people now is because it's a chemical warfare operation.
[01:11:26.076 --> 01:11:31.478]  I have the government documents where they said they're going to encourage homosexuality with chemicals so that people don't have children.
[01:11:31.858 --> 01:11:33.079]  Bob Chapman, comments on that?
[01:11:34.259 --> 01:11:35.860]  Well, I've heard about that before.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.961]  I haven't gone into it as deeply as others have.
[01:11:39.457 --> 01:11:50.423]  But there's no question in my mind that a great deal of the activity in that sphere is because of the things that we eat or eat out of.
[01:11:51.263 --> 01:11:57.886]  And the incidence of homosexuality is increasing and that's probably the reason why.
[01:11:58.727 --> 01:12:00.348]  Well, if you give estrogen to a bull,
[01:12:02.133 --> 01:12:05.516]  Long enough, it'll start going over and basically presenting itself to bulls.
[01:12:06.797 --> 01:12:08.538]  I've read the studies on this and talked to the vets.
[01:12:08.839 --> 01:12:10.680]  I actually worked for a large animal vet a few summers.
[01:12:11.921 --> 01:12:13.142]  And it's just a fact.
[01:12:13.442 --> 01:12:21.549]  And so we wonder why men look like women and why women are all jacked up and going into puberty, some of them at age five now.
[01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:23.371]  And when they go into the doctor,
[01:12:24.231 --> 01:12:41.099]  Uh, to, uh, you know, because they're five-year-olds having a period, some as young as three, the doctor, uh, comes to them, uh, and says, I'm gonna give you other hormones to suppress that, not, hey, let's stop drinking GMO growth hormone milk, which has been linked to it.
[01:12:41.319 --> 01:12:44.561]  Hey, let's stop drinking out of estrogen mimicking containers.
[01:12:44.901 --> 01:12:51.224]  And again, I, I even catch myself, Bob, drinking out of these estrogen, uh, mimickers, uh, because it's everywhere.
[01:12:51.424 --> 01:12:52.145]  I mean, take this.
[01:12:53.506 --> 01:12:54.846]  I don't know, but I should check.
[01:12:54.866 --> 01:12:58.169]  This is probably lined with the type of plastic that has it.
[01:12:58.449 --> 01:13:01.731]  But I still grabbed this off the shelf this morning, even though it says it's organic.
[01:13:01.991 --> 01:13:02.692]  That's not enough.
[01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:05.494]  In fact, let me... Guys, give me a knife so I can tear into this.
[01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:07.035]  Let's see if it's lined with it.
[01:13:07.055 --> 01:13:10.877]  In fact, they'll probably say if it's lined with it inside the plastic packaging.
[01:13:11.258 --> 01:13:14.940]  Oh, I wonder if this spring water, natural lime flavor I'm drinking.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.642]  I know full well HEB's putting fluoride in this.
[01:13:17.902 --> 01:13:18.863]  Why am I drinking this?
[01:13:19.503 --> 01:13:26.484]  I know full well these kettle chips say that they don't have MSG, but they've got the yeast extract thing that says it's MSG.
[01:13:26.664 --> 01:13:27.444]  What's wrong with us?
[01:13:27.484 --> 01:13:28.305]  Why won't we stop?
[01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:30.145]  Why am I so weak, Bob Chapman?
[01:13:31.625 --> 01:13:35.286]  Well, because you don't stop and think about every little thing that you do.
[01:13:35.866 --> 01:13:40.087]  When you're reading, you're hungry, and you make mistakes.
[01:13:43.207 --> 01:13:43.827]  And they know.
[01:13:44.107 --> 01:13:45.908]  They have immersed us in this, Bob.
[01:13:46.968 --> 01:13:47.908]  They certainly have.
[01:13:48.923 --> 01:13:53.264]  And it's just like the kids, they get hyperactive, which is normal, and I give them Ritalin.
[01:13:54.364 --> 01:13:58.125]  And I was introduced to that many, many years ago.
[01:13:58.145 --> 01:14:00.726]  I guess about 40 years ago.
[01:14:01.526 --> 01:14:05.427]  And the doctor said, well, should we use Ritalin?
[01:14:06.287 --> 01:14:10.168]  And I asked him which side of his head he wanted the 45 to come out of.
[01:14:10.188 --> 01:14:13.009]  Well, that's because you're with Al Qaeda.
[01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:19.826]  Okay, here is, for those watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, here's the inside of this juice box.
[01:14:20.587 --> 01:14:23.009]  And if they zoom in any more, see that thin plastic?
[01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.669]  It's got it.
[01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:27.252]  And I'm letting my children drink this.
[01:14:28.332 --> 01:14:28.633]  Why?
[01:14:28.993 --> 01:14:30.794]  All the juice could be out of a glass bottle.
[01:14:31.935 --> 01:14:33.076]  All of it could be healthy.
[01:14:33.556 --> 01:14:34.857]  But we see the word organic.
[01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:39.220]  Meanwhile, it's got an estrogen mimicker leaching right out of it.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:39.741]  Look at that.
[01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:41.122]  See the plastic, folks?
[01:14:41.182 --> 01:14:42.462]  It's got a plastic lining.
[01:14:43.339 --> 01:14:44.420]  There's the plastic lining.
[01:14:44.801 --> 01:14:46.403]  Great point, great caller, Bobby.
[01:14:46.443 --> 01:14:47.584]  I'm glad you took us in that angle.
[01:14:47.905 --> 01:14:49.307]  What's the name of that newscast?
[01:14:49.327 --> 01:14:52.931]  Because I've seen CBS newscasts admitting, and I've seen a BBC newscast.
[01:14:53.231 --> 01:14:56.716]  Conclusively, this turns... You know, I saw the...
[01:14:58.715 --> 01:15:03.878]  Police Chief of Fort Worth, two weeks ago, if I could put it up on screen for me guys, we can find it.
[01:15:04.239 --> 01:15:07.881]  You know, Police Chief promotes hormone replacement.
[01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:12.104]  And he says, injections of testosterone for cops, because cops need it.
[01:15:12.364 --> 01:15:17.688]  Men, if you're normal and have normal testosterone, that's enough testosterone to get you in a lot of trouble, and you know that.
[01:15:18.528 --> 01:15:20.670]  But, maybe cops do need testosterone.
[01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:26.474]  Because after you're done drinking your little juices, well you, I mean, you're ready to go out and have a baby.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.701]  You're ready to put makeup on.
[01:15:28.721 --> 01:15:30.062]  You're ready to wear a short skirt.
[01:15:30.502 --> 01:15:35.905]  You're ready to go, you know, put together a garden of roses or something.
[01:15:36.246 --> 01:15:37.507]  You're ready to put lipstick on.
[01:15:37.527 --> 01:15:40.849]  I mean, look at this.
[01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:42.270]  Maybe the globalists are doing me a favor.
[01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:43.711]  Maybe I'm too aggressive as a male.
[01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:47.053]  Maybe the problem is I'm not drinking enough estrogen-mimicking plastic.
[01:15:47.393 --> 01:15:48.294]  Maybe that's the problem.
[01:15:49.014 --> 01:15:50.235]  What do you say to that, Bob Chapman?
[01:15:51.808 --> 01:15:52.588]  I don't think so.
[01:15:52.608 --> 01:15:55.889]  I think you're fine as you are and just stop using that stuff.
[01:15:56.209 --> 01:16:00.550]  Maybe, maybe as the New World Order's proposed, maybe they should actually castrate us.
[01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:04.231]  Maybe that would fix it, huh?
[01:16:04.551 --> 01:16:07.191]  You'll love the New World Order!
[01:16:07.371 --> 01:16:09.592]  This'll only take a moment!
[01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:13.232]  We're the feminists from the New World Order, men!
[01:16:13.493 --> 01:16:15.253]  We're putting estrogen in your food!
[01:16:17.493 --> 01:16:19.194]  It basically does this to you.
[01:16:19.234 --> 01:16:20.054]  Put them right here.
[01:16:21.671 --> 01:16:22.272]  Oh, okay.
[01:16:23.352 --> 01:16:24.493]  I'm starting to lose my mind.
[01:16:25.273 --> 01:16:29.055]  Let's go to another caller, this time on the Genesis phones here with Bob Chapman.
[01:16:29.415 --> 01:16:30.936]  Let's talk to Terry in Florida.
[01:16:30.956 --> 01:16:31.896]  Terry, you're on the air.
[01:16:33.997 --> 01:16:35.238]  Hey, thanks for taking the call, Al.
[01:16:35.718 --> 01:16:36.539]  Hi, Terry.
[01:16:37.299 --> 01:16:38.600]  You don't like the New World Order?
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.460]  We can fix that.
[01:16:41.941 --> 01:16:43.802]  Well, I would like to see that happen.
[01:16:44.903 --> 01:16:50.426]  But, Mike, I have a question for Bob, but I did want to mention that
[01:16:51.545 --> 01:17:00.168]  Why aren't the Black Minds Parish District Attorney Charles Belay pressing charges?
[01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:01.108]  Why isn't St.
[01:17:01.148 --> 01:17:04.949]  Bernard Parish President Craig Tappera Jr.
[01:17:04.969 --> 01:17:05.809]  pressing charges?
[01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:11.411]  Why isn't Hancock County Mississippi Sheriff Steve Garber pressing charges?
[01:17:11.671 --> 01:17:14.612]  Why isn't Harrison County Sheriff Mississippi
[01:17:16.205 --> 01:17:22.351]  Yeah, why did the state governors immediately say, we're gonna go, you know, start blocking the estuaries?
[01:17:22.612 --> 01:17:24.794]  No, they said, the feds won't let us!
[01:17:25.014 --> 01:17:30.319]  It's like saying, the feds won't, hold on, I didn't get a call from the government saying I could breathe.
[01:17:30.519 --> 01:17:31.420]  I'm gonna hold my breath.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.004]  We'll be back after this break with Terry and we'll see if I can hold my breath.
[01:17:35.044 --> 01:17:35.464]  We'll see.
[01:17:36.465 --> 01:17:41.027]  Give the government calls on this phone by then to tell me I'm allowed to breathe.
[01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:41.727]  Okay?
[01:17:42.107 --> 01:17:48.029]  Because if I'm going to breathe, I have to have government permission because government is God.
[01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:50.890]  And so, I'm going to start holding my breath now.
[01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:54.752]  We'll see when we get back in three minutes if I can do it and if the government calls and gives me permission.
[01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:55.072]  Hold on.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.543]  Times are tough and you gotta stretch that dollar.

[01:18:55.533 --> 01:18:56.294]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:18:56.974 --> 01:19:01.858]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:02.718]  What have we got?
[01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:05.060]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.101]  A republic.
[01:19:06.401 --> 01:19:08.963]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:19:09.043 --> 01:19:10.964]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:19:11.305 --> 01:19:13.206]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:19:13.326 --> 01:19:14.607]  So they think they own our land?
[01:19:15.007 --> 01:19:16.128]  They think they own our water?
[01:19:16.328 --> 01:19:16.729]  Children?
[01:19:16.949 --> 01:19:17.729]  Our education?
[01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.710]  Our money?
[01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:22.533]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:19:22.913 --> 01:19:26.559]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:19:26.599 --> 01:19:27.560]  You're being warned.
[01:19:27.881 --> 01:19:28.702]  We have the facts.
[01:19:28.903 --> 01:19:30.004]  We have the Constitution.
[01:19:30.064 --> 01:19:30.946]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:31.787]  We have common law.
[01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:34.111]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:34.391 --> 01:19:38.157]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:19:38.257 --> 01:19:43.060]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.580]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:45.561]  Don't tread on me.

[01:19:57.082 --> 01:20:00.104]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:20:00.444 --> 01:20:04.067]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:07.809]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:20:49.546 --> 01:20:50.186]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[01:21:08.426 --> 01:21:09.706]  Is it getting better?
[01:21:09.906 --> 01:21:12.447]  Okay, going back to Terry in Florida.
[01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.987]  Terry, finishing up your point, because we can't list every county.
[01:21:15.988 --> 01:21:20.609]  There's probably 300, 400 counties in those states or more where they haven't filed charges.
[01:21:21.529 --> 01:21:28.291]  If it does show neglect by BP to not come in when they had the manpower and blocked the estuaries, that's a problem.
[01:21:28.331 --> 01:21:29.511]  But the bigger issue is
[01:21:30.845 --> 01:21:41.171]  Our daddy, President Hussein Beresetaro, the Kenyan-Indonesian citizen, he wants this to be as bad as possible so he can pass a bunch of legislation.
[01:21:41.471 --> 01:21:43.612]  He wouldn't let those states fix the problem.
[01:21:43.852 --> 01:21:45.273]  But then it falls back on the states.
[01:21:46.093 --> 01:21:53.837]  I mean, if my neighbor shows up at my house and says, you're not allowed to breathe unless I give you permission, and then I go and suffocate myself with a plastic bag, I'm a mental patient.
[01:21:54.677 --> 01:22:00.540]  So, the states need to stop, you know, we're mad at you, federal government, you wouldn't let a state fix it!
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:05.162]  Why are they letting the Indonesian citizen tell us what to do?
[01:22:05.902 --> 01:22:06.262]  Terry?
[01:22:07.463 --> 01:22:14.066]  I would say it's because the Indonesian and his buddies at Goldman Sachs are printing their paychecks.
[01:22:14.691 --> 01:22:18.772]  And they want their pay, and every good Nazi followed his orders for his paycheck.
[01:22:20.032 --> 01:22:20.872]  I agree with you, Terry.
[01:22:20.992 --> 01:22:21.952]  I appreciate your call.
[01:22:21.992 --> 01:22:30.834]  Bob Chapman, your take on the states, for 40-plus days, whining, saying the feds won't let them fix it, and the military makes them count booms for a week and then never puts them out.
[01:22:31.414 --> 01:22:36.235]  Since when do the feds run everything on the planet Earth?
[01:22:37.915 --> 01:22:39.255]  Well, since a long time.
[01:22:39.976 --> 01:22:42.016]  And I'm sure that they're saying that to them.
[01:22:42.714 --> 01:22:43.855]  Uh, we'll fix the problem.
[01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:46.677]  Well, they're not going to do that for the reasons you expressed.
[01:22:47.397 --> 01:22:48.838]  It's a false flag operation.
[01:22:48.878 --> 01:22:51.120]  Now it's out of hand and they don't know what to do.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.161]  And it's going to get worse.
[01:22:54.262 --> 01:22:57.904]  And it's going to be disastrous and extraordinarily expensive.
[01:22:57.944 --> 01:23:04.648]  Never mind all of the sea life and... Well, flesh that out, Bob, because I respect you and you don't just come out and say something's a false flag.
[01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:08.391]  I mean, I've seen my evidence, but why are you saying false flag?
[01:23:09.291 --> 01:23:11.873]  Because why did
[01:23:12.441 --> 01:23:19.987]  Goldman Sachs sell 44% of their BP stock three weeks before the incident happened.
[01:23:21.028 --> 01:23:28.514]  Why did they short the drill equipment in the Gulf?
[01:23:28.874 --> 01:23:37.661]  And why did the president of BP sell one-third of his holdings at the same time Goldman Sachs did?
[01:23:38.582 --> 01:23:40.864]  And I think he sold it through Goldman.
[01:23:41.605 --> 01:23:56.165]  And we don't have any information, but it stands to reason that they both may have bought derivatives that are short against the box to freeze their positions so that they wouldn't lose any further money.
[01:23:57.543 --> 01:23:59.184]  That's what tipped me off.
[01:23:59.364 --> 01:24:07.047]  And it turns out Goldman Sachs, who literally, if somebody slips on a banana peel nine times out of the ten, Goldman Sachs laid it there.
[01:24:07.087 --> 01:24:09.468]  I mean, every country they're imploding, they're always running.
[01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:14.670]  Brazil, Argentina, Greece, I mean, you name it.
[01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:18.892]  Iceland, they put their people in government and then steal everything.
[01:24:19.152 --> 01:24:25.694]  And it turns out the chairman of BP was the co-chairman until the week before of BP.
[01:24:27.535 --> 01:24:30.557]  I mean, this is really getting suspicious, Bob.
[01:24:30.858 --> 01:24:40.645]  And then, the fact that the feds wouldn't let the states... I mean, the states were there with their own booms, about to put them in front of the rivers and estuaries, which can really cause the damage if that oil gets up in there.
[01:24:40.866 --> 01:24:45.669]  The ocean, it dissipates, but going into a river, that's per capita, so much oil, it's much worse.
[01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:47.311]  And the feds said no.
[01:24:48.091 --> 01:24:53.716]  I mean, this is a false flag, but why do you say it's out of control now?
[01:24:55.971 --> 01:25:09.119]  Uh, they have fissures, uh, in different areas in the same general region that evidently have been caused by what went on in the well that, well, essentially they blew up.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:15.342]  And it blew up with such force that it, uh, created fissures, or they didn't frack it properly.
[01:25:15.362 --> 01:25:18.024]  I don't understand all the terminology, but...
[01:25:19.529 --> 01:25:23.773]  Guys, will you work next week on getting well-known petroleum geologists and geologists on?
[01:25:24.294 --> 01:25:25.335]  And petroleum engineers?
[01:25:26.315 --> 01:25:28.958]  I guess a petroleum engineer, though, works at the petroleum facilities.
[01:25:29.599 --> 01:25:30.319]  I don't know anymore.
[01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:31.520]  Bob, do five more minutes with us.
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.441]  We'll take a few more calls.
[01:25:32.882 --> 01:25:33.702]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:25:33.742 --> 01:25:34.983]  This is the Insane Asylum.

[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.505]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:51.966 --> 01:26:54.732]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:19.366 --> 01:27:20.868]  We are back live.
[01:27:20.908 --> 01:27:25.074]  We've got the folks from Free Talk Live, a very popular Genesis show.
[01:27:25.094 --> 01:27:30.122]  Well, they got 70-something affiliates, so that's really great joining us.
[01:27:30.142 --> 01:27:35.630]  They're libertarians, and I was on their show, and I was going to have them on about immigration and the
[01:27:37.216 --> 01:27:49.768]  The ultra-uber-libertarian view, let's just have open borders, the problem is you put in purely libertarian policies while a socialist system is still in place, or a fascist system, and that's the quickest way to slit your throat.
[01:27:50.328 --> 01:27:51.489]  Seven ways from Sunday.
[01:27:51.789 --> 01:27:54.552]  So we'll be discussing that with them coming up here.
[01:27:54.992 --> 01:27:56.374]  Going back to Bob Chapman, though.
[01:27:57.955 --> 01:28:02.018]  We've got the Coast Guard hearing reports, and that's actually in my stack from three days ago.
[01:28:02.058 --> 01:28:11.023]  A caller called in, though, and brought it up, and I'm like, oh my gosh, I meant to cover that, because here I am at home, reading this and freaking out, where they said, we've never put a pipe this big on.
[01:28:11.063 --> 01:28:13.485]  We've never attached a bigger pipe to a smaller pipe.
[01:28:14.105 --> 01:28:16.627]  The Halliburton people were upset, saying this is going to blow up.
[01:28:16.887 --> 01:28:19.489]  The other engineers, the operators of the rig were upset.
[01:28:19.769 --> 01:28:23.531]  There were arguments, two weeks of actual screaming and yelling, and that
[01:28:26.133 --> 01:28:39.106]  It appears that BP, and this is on record, ordered them to do things that have never been done, that they wouldn't do with a shallow, low-pressure well, and that everyone basically on the floating rig
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.342]  We're just waiting for doom and we're sure doom was coming and that's the headline.
[01:28:44.382 --> 01:28:45.242]  I can't actually quote.
[01:28:45.682 --> 01:28:47.523]  You guys reprint it because I thought it was in my stack.
[01:28:47.863 --> 01:28:58.367]  It was an Atlantic Monthly headline a couple days ago because it was quoting the head of the rig as screaming at the VP executive saying
[01:29:01.568 --> 01:29:03.208]  The rig is now on fire.
[01:29:03.368 --> 01:29:04.889]  I hope you're effing happy.
[01:29:04.909 --> 01:29:08.270]  And I don't normally say the A-S-S word or the F word here.
[01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:09.590]  The president's using it.
[01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:11.151]  Oil rig people are using it.
[01:29:11.431 --> 01:29:12.471]  It's like in a court.
[01:29:12.611 --> 01:29:13.972]  I'm just telling you what was said.
[01:29:14.592 --> 01:29:20.174]  And they're screaming at the BP people because whatever they were told to do, they just said, that's going to blow up!
[01:29:21.067 --> 01:29:33.350]  So, is it pure hubris by BP, believing they're God because the CEO is good at playing golf, he thought he could tell the engineers what to do, or did they know giving that order would cause this, and then why?
[01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:36.971]  In closing, Bob Chapman, why would they want to run this false flag?
[01:29:38.392 --> 01:29:43.893]  I think they want a distraction, and I think that North Korea was one.
[01:29:44.614 --> 01:29:53.541]  And I think to an extent, perhaps the Israeli episodes are in the same genre, so to speak.
[01:29:54.102 --> 01:29:58.946]  But this is a long-term problem, and it would have been anyway.
[01:29:59.606 --> 01:30:02.148]  Now it's going to be tens and twenties of years.
[01:30:03.029 --> 01:30:09.094]  And they want people worried about all of the things that are going to happen to the golfer are in process.
[01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:17.795]  And if they're thinking about that, they're not worrying about the stock market not going up, the sovereign debt in Europe.
[01:30:18.975 --> 01:30:24.598]  They're not worried about the price of gold hitting new highs all the time.
[01:30:25.639 --> 01:30:26.720]  The people are distracted.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:27.700]  They're doing something else.
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.622]  And as you said earlier, they're going to have a war.
[01:30:31.422 --> 01:30:32.743]  And that's another distraction.
[01:30:32.763 --> 01:30:35.665]  Of course, it'll also get rid of all those useless eaters.
[01:30:37.142 --> 01:30:39.005]  And so they plan these things.
[01:30:39.085 --> 01:30:42.350]  I mean, look at Pearl Harbor and so many other instances.
[01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:46.336]  I know it's disheartening, but that's what these people do.
[01:30:48.729 --> 01:30:50.630]  Absolutely.
[01:30:51.350 --> 01:31:01.173]  They know what they're doing, and Katie barred the door, because so they can maintain control of their financial fraud and gain more control, they are going to pull the stops out.
[01:31:01.653 --> 01:31:06.494]  And if Israel has to make a boneheaded move as a distraction for these people, Israel will follow orders.
[01:31:06.814 --> 01:31:12.136]  And if BP's got to blow an oil rig sky high by giving people orders they know is going to cause a blowout,
[01:31:13.076 --> 01:31:15.179]  Uh, probably bigger than they thought, though, is the word.
[01:31:15.199 --> 01:31:20.847]  Uh, you know, I love Lindsey Williams, but he says that the elite had a Ouija board and they were able to know this was going to happen.
[01:31:20.867 --> 01:31:21.708]  That's why they pulled out.
[01:31:21.728 --> 01:31:23.511]  No, it's an inside job.
[01:31:23.731 --> 01:31:25.373]  That's what all the evidence points at.
[01:31:25.974 --> 01:31:28.117]  And, uh, it's just getting more and more crazy from here.
[01:31:28.518 --> 01:31:29.359]  Bob, I hope we're here.
[01:31:29.719 --> 01:31:30.620]  Still here next week.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.740]  Lord Willen, we love you.

[01:31:42.707 --> 01:31:44.729]  We'll talk to you next week, Sweetie Pipe.
[01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.891]  Thank you.
[01:31:50.931 --> 01:31:51.331]  Bye-bye.
[01:31:51.492 --> 01:31:51.812]  You bet.
[01:31:51.832 --> 01:31:52.293]  Take care.
[01:31:52.393 --> 01:31:52.573]  All right.
[01:31:52.593 --> 01:31:53.094]  We'll be back.
[01:31:53.114 --> 01:31:54.196]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:54.216 --> 01:31:55.658]  Free Talk Live, folks.
[01:31:55.698 --> 01:31:56.159]  Coming up.
[01:31:56.299 --> 01:32:00.525]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:32:00.846 --> 01:32:01.486]  Number one.
[01:32:01.767 --> 01:32:04.912]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:05.673]  Number two.
[01:32:06.033 --> 01:32:10.594]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:10.914 --> 01:32:11.374]  It's true.
[01:32:11.654 --> 01:32:17.076]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:17.356 --> 01:32:20.636]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:20.936 --> 01:32:25.417]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:25.658 --> 01:32:28.018]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:31.759]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:36.803]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:37.024 --> 01:32:41.788]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:42.088 --> 01:32:46.112]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:46.252 --> 01:32:47.834]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:56.101 --> 01:33:00.064]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:33:00.304 --> 01:33:06.328]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:33:06.708 --> 01:33:13.793]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:33:14.093 --> 01:33:18.676]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:33:21.698 --> 01:33:24.199]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:26.540]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:26.981]  Call us!
[01:33:43.408 --> 01:33:43.608]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:48.410]  Thank you.
[01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:51.171]  You may be arrested and or subject to other charges.
[01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.931]  Tyranny is here.
[01:34:01.251 --> 01:34:05.173]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:34:05.193 --> 01:34:07.434]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:34:07.594 --> 01:34:12.877]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:34:13.297 --> 01:34:19.521]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:34:19.941 --> 01:34:25.524]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:34:25.904 --> 01:34:29.606]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:34:30.126 --> 01:34:34.148]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:34:34.389 --> 01:34:39.951]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:34:40.332 --> 01:34:43.313]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:34:43.894 --> 01:34:45.334]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:34:45.875 --> 01:34:46.315]  It's here.

[01:34:56.922 --> 01:35:01.985]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:02.345 --> 01:35:04.466]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:35:10.808 --> 01:35:13.611]  Okay, we've got fellow GCN radio hosts.
[01:35:13.651 --> 01:35:16.434]  I like to have them pop in from time to time.
[01:35:17.836 --> 01:35:19.017]  A different talk show host.
[01:35:22.581 --> 01:35:25.324]  And we look forward in the next 52 minutes to talking to them.
[01:35:25.344 --> 01:35:28.207]  Ian Freeman and of course Mark Edge.
[01:35:28.247 --> 01:35:29.128]  They both host
[01:35:30.196 --> 01:35:35.880]  Free Talk Live and they both moved up to New Hampshire to be part of the Free State Porcupine Project.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:39.383]  You know, nice friendly porcupine, but it's got some spines on it.
[01:35:39.403 --> 01:35:40.664]  It says, don't tread on me.
[01:35:40.684 --> 01:35:49.150]  Of course, I like the rattlesnake myself, but I do like little cuddly porcupines as they call them, I think, over in France.
[01:35:51.687 --> 01:35:53.188]  A little sweet little porcupines.
[01:35:53.208 --> 01:35:57.372]  In fact, maybe we should pull up a porcupine Free State Project symbol.
[01:35:58.012 --> 01:36:03.036]  But then Chris Matthews will probably do a show about how deadly it is and how it symbolizes racism.
[01:36:03.296 --> 01:36:05.598]  The porcupine, a racist animal.
[01:36:06.359 --> 01:36:08.720]  Yes, it attends Klan rallies.
[01:36:09.041 --> 01:36:12.243]  Show a little porcupine with a white hood on top of it.
[01:36:15.306 --> 01:36:17.908]  Porcupines are also known to be working with Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:19.022 --> 01:36:21.644]  Osama Bin Laden's favorite animal is the porcupine.
[01:36:23.685 --> 01:36:28.989]  Coming up, Wednesday night, the new rise of the right and their evil symbol, the porcupine.
[01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:36.955]  You know, I joke about that, but there's an article about Chris Matthews earlier in the week did a whole show about how evil the Gadsden flag is.
[01:36:36.995 --> 01:36:39.837]  This is on Infowars.com, Gadsden flag.
[01:36:40.417 --> 01:36:46.642]  And it's even worse, on the back it says, the tree of liberty must be watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:53.662]  That's how I scuffed up my elbows was in a fight with David Rockefeller out there during the break.
[01:36:55.282 --> 01:36:59.184]  My wife's here today, and I'm acting goofy for her, I guess.
[01:36:59.824 --> 01:37:00.804]  That's why she likes me.
[01:37:01.104 --> 01:37:11.288]  No, but seriously, ladies and gentlemen, getting back to serious issues, he did a whole thing demonizing it, saying it's an anti-British thing and that the Tea Partiers are delusional and believe they're fighting redcoats.
[01:37:11.528 --> 01:37:29.577]  No, it's getting back to our revolutionary history against big government and big governments that are 4,000 or 5,000 miles away telling us what we can and can't do, like Obama telling these governors in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi that they couldn't go block the oil themselves and then the feds wouldn't come block it.
[01:37:30.058 --> 01:37:31.838]  That's what we're trying to get back to.
[01:37:32.119 --> 01:37:34.520]  That's what we want as a society.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.482]  That's what the Gadsden flag and the porcupine symbolize.
[01:37:38.742 --> 01:37:40.442]  It means don't walk on me.
[01:37:40.563 --> 01:37:42.023]  Don't stomp on me.
[01:37:42.603 --> 01:37:44.024]  I don't want to lick your boots.
[01:37:44.464 --> 01:37:47.686]  I don't think government made the sun rise and the grass grow.
[01:37:48.126 --> 01:37:48.626]  I'm sorry.
[01:37:48.646 --> 01:37:50.667]  I don't want to call you an authority or an official.
[01:37:50.867 --> 01:37:52.328]  I want to call you a public servant.
[01:37:54.599 --> 01:38:05.208]  Alright, we're going to go over some of their websites, but they are here with us today, and they have a talk show on the evenings on the GCN Radio Network, and I originally had them coming on.
[01:38:06.118 --> 01:38:09.179]  Because they said, we'd like to talk to you in the future about your views on immigration.
[01:38:09.199 --> 01:38:13.540]  Because we're on about other subjects when I was on their show, and I said, why don't you come on my show and talk about it?
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.880]  And so they are here, but so much is going on.
[01:38:16.401 --> 01:38:21.062]  Ian and company, Mark, it's good to have both you guys here with us today.
[01:38:21.422 --> 01:38:22.362]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[01:38:23.042 --> 01:38:25.863]  Well, I'm good, but I'm a little bit scared by the porcupine that I just saw.
[01:38:27.584 --> 01:38:29.666]  Hey, by the way, you know, I don't consider them public servants.
[01:38:29.866 --> 01:38:36.092]  I mean, they serve themselves to your money, but they don't actually have any accountability to what they do.
[01:38:36.212 --> 01:38:41.677]  And when a servant is acting like a master, clearly there's something very screwy going on.
[01:38:42.739 --> 01:38:43.360]  Absolutely.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:44.440]  Absolutely.
[01:38:44.661 --> 01:38:52.447]  And, you know, they're trying to sell us on a world where we're not allowed to ride a bike because we might fall off and skin our elbow.
[01:38:53.207 --> 01:38:58.932]  Or we're not allowed to, you know, this girl, 16, of course many of our founding fathers were 23, 24.
[01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:01.654]  People in the olden days were adults when they were 13, 14.
[01:39:04.036 --> 01:39:15.963]  What do you say about this young girl whose boat went missing yesterday, but now they found her with the beacon, and now the media is saying, oh my God, we can't let, you know, teenagers rock climb, we can't let them get on a sailboat.
[01:39:16.023 --> 01:39:19.625]  I mean, my view is full-grown sailors lose their lives.
[01:39:19.645 --> 01:39:24.929]  If we can ban a 16-year-old who's a young lady but an adult, then we can ban a 50-year-old man.
[01:39:25.771 --> 01:39:29.173]  Well, it's not like the media didn't know that this girl was going on her trip.
[01:39:29.233 --> 01:39:36.939]  I remember hearing an interview on NPR a couple of months ago about this brave young lass that will be sailing her boat around the world.
[01:39:37.119 --> 01:39:40.961]  And what a beacon for femininity and youth that she was.
[01:39:41.021 --> 01:39:44.404]  And now that she had a problem because storms come up in the open ocean.
[01:39:46.825 --> 01:39:54.949]  That, you know, it's a bad thing, but what concerns me most is I hear that there are three ships steaming towards her now, and I imagine they're probably already there.
[01:39:54.969 --> 01:39:58.150]  And I guess they're actually probably dieseling, but that was the term they used.
[01:39:58.610 --> 01:40:02.092]  How much are we paying as taxpayers for this gal to be rescued?
[01:40:02.112 --> 01:40:07.574]  It seems to me she should be, she and her entourage are the ones that should be paying for it.
[01:40:07.715 --> 01:40:11.396]  But should she be left to the sharks?
[01:40:11.436 --> 01:40:14.318]  I mean, you do notice it's a private boat's going to help her.
[01:40:15.981 --> 01:40:16.922]  No, I don't know that.
[01:40:32.842 --> 01:40:35.043]  When she's 18 and she wants to commit suicide, she could.
[01:40:35.383 --> 01:40:38.363]  I mean, it's dangerous, much less a circumnavigation of the globe.
[01:40:38.603 --> 01:40:44.505]  Her brother got chased by pirates in the same area when he was 17, and so it is asking for it.
[01:40:44.545 --> 01:40:48.466]  But I don't want to lose my liberty, so if they want to go do this, more power to them.
[01:40:48.746 --> 01:40:55.527]  And I think it's bold, and I think it's okay for her to get rescued, but I agree, if any taxpayer money goes into this, Mommy and Daddy need to fit the bill.
[01:40:55.908 --> 01:40:57.328]  Yeah, that's how I feel about it.
[01:40:57.912 --> 01:40:58.953]  All right, so let's do it, Alex.
[01:40:59.173 --> 01:40:59.973]  Let's talk immigration.
[01:41:00.394 --> 01:41:01.314]  Let's talk immigration.
[01:41:01.354 --> 01:41:04.196]  Okay, go ahead and tell us your views on immigration, men.
[01:41:04.336 --> 01:41:05.017]  Ian and Mark.
[01:41:05.577 --> 01:41:07.298]  Mark, do you want to start?
[01:41:07.719 --> 01:41:08.099]  Sure.
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:13.223]  What our belief is, is that free people should be able to cross borders of free countries freely.
[01:41:13.423 --> 01:41:15.204]  And there are certainly some issues that
[01:41:15.504 --> 01:41:21.190]  That should be resolved and it may very well be that allowing free people to do that would resolve those issues.
[01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:23.652]  Some of those issues are things like welfare.
[01:41:23.672 --> 01:41:31.520]  I don't think that anybody should be required to pay for anybody else's child to be sent to school, to pay for their medical conditions, to pay for their food.
[01:41:32.501 --> 01:41:36.444]  Those are the jobs of charities and mutual aid societies.
[01:41:37.485 --> 01:41:47.433]  I don't think that you should be required to send kids to school or to pay for their hospital bills or hospitals should be required to cover their medical bills and therefore your insurance rates and your hospital bills go up.
[01:41:48.054 --> 01:41:55.360]  But I do think that people should be allowed to come to this country and work for a better life as so many of our forefathers did.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:42:03.626]  I mean, it's a country of immigrants and in the past, even though there have been immigration laws since the late 19th century, before that they didn't have them.
[01:42:04.747 --> 01:42:07.750]  But see, I agree with you, but here's the problem.
[01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:08.771]  If you have a government
[01:42:28.103 --> 01:42:32.766]  That is, A, saying, come here, have a baby, everything's paid for.
[01:42:33.526 --> 01:42:39.670]  And by the way, our Ford Foundation schools are going to teach you that this belongs to Mexico and America's evil.
[01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:49.277]  And we're going to use you as a political weapon to take Alex Jones' private property and his guns, which 90 plus percent of these people end up voting for in every statistic we've got.
[01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:51.138]  Then I can't say, oh,
[01:42:51.738 --> 01:42:53.119]  I'm a big happy libertarian.
[01:42:53.419 --> 01:43:01.344]  Let's have hundreds of millions more from all over the world come here and here, raise my taxes, everything's free.
[01:43:01.424 --> 01:43:03.705]  Oh, and here's my guns because you voted for it.
[01:43:04.085 --> 01:43:09.709]  It is suicide to have open borders because we don't have a libertarian free state.
[01:43:10.449 --> 01:43:12.952]  I understand in the great free state there would be no state.
[01:43:12.972 --> 01:43:16.316]  There would just be free individuals of the world figuring it out in a free market.
[01:43:16.616 --> 01:43:23.624]  The problem is I got Goldman Sachs running my government using it for corporate welfare to literally suck every drop of blood.
[01:43:23.644 --> 01:43:24.225]  You're right.
[01:43:25.206 --> 01:43:25.747]  Alex, you're right.
[01:43:25.787 --> 01:43:43.263]  I mean, the first thing that you said there was that you mentioned that it's the government and it's the fact that people believe in government, that they believe that it's appropriate to use aggressive force against their neighbors to either make them behave in the way they want them to behave or to stop doing the things that they don't like them to do.
[01:43:43.603 --> 01:43:51.330]  It's this belief in coercion and in government that continues to perpetuate this system where the government is used as a tool
[01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:52.330]  Here's an example.
[01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:57.112]  If my neighbors are yelling and screaming and their dog keeps barking, I'm not going to call the cops on them.
[01:43:57.152 --> 01:43:58.072]  I'm going to go knock on their door.
[01:43:58.972 --> 01:44:09.015]  And then, of course, if they try to assault me, then I'll probably try to call the police, because this isn't 10,000 B.C., and if I beat the daylights out of the guy or fight back, I'm going to be the one going to prison.
[01:44:10.856 --> 01:44:12.638]  Do you guys believe in zero government?
[01:44:12.658 --> 01:44:17.744]  Because the founders said we needed a government to protect us from another government.
[01:44:17.964 --> 01:44:24.932]  Because as long as you've got other governments, the minute we get rid of a government, they're going to come over here with their bigger government and make us their slaves.
[01:44:26.494 --> 01:44:27.414]  Less government.
[01:44:27.735 --> 01:44:30.576]  And when we get to less government, I believe in less government than that.
[01:44:30.656 --> 01:44:33.637]  And when we get to less government than that, I believe in less government than that.
[01:44:33.997 --> 01:44:40.879]  I believe that there should be voluntary interactions between individuals as much as possible.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:44.541]  And I think what we have today is not an immigration problem, but a government problem.
[01:44:44.821 --> 01:44:50.183]  And I hesitate, I doubt very seriously that you can use the government to solve a government problem.
[01:44:50.203 --> 01:44:50.463]  No way.
[01:44:51.024 --> 01:44:51.784]  It's just not going to work.
[01:44:51.804 --> 01:44:57.410]  The only thing you can get is a police state where they're knocking on our doors, demanding to see our Mexicans that we've got in the backyard.
[01:44:57.430 --> 01:45:01.134]  A war on immigration would be the same as a war on drugs has been.
[01:45:01.174 --> 01:45:05.258]  You get more drugs, you get more dangerous drugs, you get violence, you get the black market.
[01:45:05.278 --> 01:45:05.558]  Oh, no, I agree.
[01:45:05.598 --> 01:45:12.305]  They're going to selectively enforce, and when they do arrest illegals, they're going to take them and give them green cards and legalize them.
[01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:15.671]  I mean, that's what they've been caught doing already.
[01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:36.839]  Alex, I hesitate to even use that term, illegals, because I think the connotation there is that these are people, we're calling them illegals because they've broken some arbitrary diktat laid down by some unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., and I can proudly say that I have broken plenty of their diktats, and I don't follow their rules, and so I would also be an illegal by that definition.
[01:45:37.619 --> 01:45:38.999]  Ian, Ian, there are laws.
[01:45:39.039 --> 01:45:39.600]  There are laws.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:45.282]  If you jump out in traffic with any mile an hour traffic in front of an 18-wheeler, you're going to get your guts all over the highway.
[01:45:45.322 --> 01:45:46.282]  That's a law of nature.
[01:45:46.302 --> 01:45:47.262]  Yeah, but hold on.
[01:45:47.322 --> 01:45:54.865]  It's a law of human tribal nature that we got Mexico that's lost wars with the U.S., that's fully collapsed under their government.
[01:45:56.046 --> 01:46:00.589]  With 100 plus million people, 30 plus million that are here right now.
[01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:11.857]  And again, we go back to this thing of we still have a government, we have all this welfare, we have all this in place, and then we have this structure.
[01:46:12.238 --> 01:46:13.278]  They are illegal.
[01:46:13.418 --> 01:46:21.524]  If you try to go down to Mexico and live however you want, and I mean, Ian, why don't you get with a woman and go down there and ask for a free baby and free health care?
[01:46:21.725 --> 01:46:23.306]  You're going to get your butt thrown in prison.
[01:46:23.866 --> 01:46:25.867]  I mean, do you know the illegal aliens in Mexico?
[01:46:26.107 --> 01:46:32.870]  My point is, my point is you can't lower the borders until you have that free state.
[01:46:33.891 --> 01:46:39.553]  Well, I don't think that what the Mexican government does has anything to do with what, you know, free people do.
[01:46:39.673 --> 01:46:41.534]  I mean, that's just another group of tyrants.
[01:46:41.714 --> 01:46:42.695]  But it abuts us!
[01:46:42.715 --> 01:46:49.978]  Yeah, but you can't... Listen, if you've got a big government sitting right next to you, and then you lower your borders to it,
[01:46:51.277 --> 01:46:53.758]  They're gonna come in and get all the welfare, which you say you're against.
[01:46:53.818 --> 01:46:55.318]  I mean, I'm talking about reality.
[01:46:55.578 --> 01:46:56.478]  How about what's gonna happen?
[01:46:57.458 --> 01:46:58.799]  Don't answer it!
[01:46:59.339 --> 01:47:07.420]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:19.324]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[01:47:56.414 --> 01:48:01.237]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:48:27.314 --> 01:48:28.135]  We have the facts.
[01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:29.455]  We have the Constitution.
[01:48:29.495 --> 01:48:30.375]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:48:30.395 --> 01:48:31.236]  We have common law.

[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:44.980]  Don't Tread on Me.

[01:48:57.079 --> 01:48:59.682]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:49:00.083 --> 01:49:05.050]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:49:05.410 --> 01:49:07.152]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:49:07.473 --> 01:49:12.279]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:13.441]  How much do you want?
[01:49:13.661 --> 01:49:14.382]  When do you want it?
[01:49:14.762 --> 01:49:16.363]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:49:16.643 --> 01:49:17.464]  When will you need it?
[01:49:17.724 --> 01:49:19.786]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:49:19.926 --> 01:49:21.027]  Will there be any food?
[01:49:21.267 --> 01:49:22.588]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:49:22.788 --> 01:49:27.851]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:49:28.052 --> 01:49:31.194]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:49:31.634 --> 01:49:35.137]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:49:35.457 --> 01:49:36.418]  How much will you need?
[01:49:36.678 --> 01:49:37.279]  We don't know.
[01:49:37.579 --> 01:49:38.480]  How much do you want?
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:39.400]  All you can get.
[01:49:39.601 --> 01:49:40.461]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:40.701 --> 01:49:43.464]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:49:43.764 --> 01:49:45.926]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:46.966]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:49:56.457 --> 01:49:59.378]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:49:59.458 --> 01:50:01.399]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:50:01.519 --> 01:50:04.180]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:06.220]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:07.681]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:09.521]  But first, the facts.
[01:50:09.802 --> 01:50:11.522]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:50:11.742 --> 01:50:13.463]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:50:13.723 --> 01:50:17.204]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:50:17.404 --> 01:50:24.787]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:50:25.147 --> 01:50:25.767]  Sinofresh.
[01:50:26.027 --> 01:50:28.908]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[01:50:44.234 --> 01:50:45.374]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[01:50:45.394 --> 01:50:45.774]  Mention GCN.
[01:50:45.794 --> 01:50:46.575]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[01:50:46.715 --> 01:50:46.995]  It works!
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:59.722]  Okay, let's hear from Mark and Ann.
[01:51:12.489 --> 01:51:24.040]  How this works, because they're saying, yes, we can't give all these people free welfare, but I can't even call them illegal because there can't even be laws.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:26.862]  Well, that's not going from a little less government to a little less.
[01:51:27.603 --> 01:51:32.706]  To a little less in orderly fashion, which I agree, we could shrink the state almost down to nothing.
[01:51:33.166 --> 01:51:36.428]  That would be a much more individualistic, free, wealthier society.
[01:51:36.488 --> 01:51:38.289]  History and common sense show that.
[01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:45.534]  But, I mean, I'm gonna have to pay the unlimited bankrupt taxes for all the illegal aliens to have all their kids and everything paid for?
[01:51:45.554 --> 01:51:46.034]  Alex?
[01:51:46.674 --> 01:51:47.355]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:51:47.395 --> 01:51:48.256]  Let's focus on that.
[01:51:48.417 --> 01:51:52.502]  And real quick, if I could, you keep using a term that really, it gets to me.
[01:51:52.963 --> 01:51:53.463]  It's we.
[01:51:54.044 --> 01:52:04.598]  And I am not the government, and so I try my best, and sometimes I'll use this term, and I try to catch myself on it, and Mark and I try to catch each other using it, because we've been indoctrinated.
[01:52:04.978 --> 01:52:08.101]  To speak in this collectivistic speak.
[01:52:08.701 --> 01:52:10.443]  And we are not the government.
[01:52:10.663 --> 01:52:11.704]  They are the government.
[01:52:12.104 --> 01:52:14.747]  And they are going to impose certain things on us.
[01:52:14.807 --> 01:52:21.653]  And the people that are out there calling for immigration control are calling for the government to control other people.
[01:52:21.713 --> 01:52:26.237]  And they're going to have... But that is one of the things the founding fathers said the federal government's supposed to do.
[01:52:26.317 --> 01:52:26.738]  And listen!
[01:52:27.438 --> 01:52:35.002]  I mean, the globalists want to get rid of my common culture as an American, which means Second Amendment, liberty, freedom.
[01:52:35.322 --> 01:52:39.724]  And so, of course the globalists want to get rid of my culture and don't want me to say, we Americans.
[01:52:40.324 --> 01:52:42.145]  And then they want to sell it with the globalism.
[01:52:42.825 --> 01:52:54.737]  Let me tell you, Alex, we don't have currently in our society anywhere near the most amount of immigrants, first generation immigrants that we've had in the past.
[01:52:54.857 --> 01:52:59.001]  So we're not anywhere near the idea of shaking the foundations of our culture.
[01:52:59.321 --> 01:53:01.083]  Benjamin Franklin said the same thing about the
[01:53:01.423 --> 01:53:06.044]  The German immigrants in Pennsylvania back in the 18th century.
[01:53:06.124 --> 01:53:08.885]  So, I mean, these ideas are nothing new.
[01:53:09.345 --> 01:53:15.026]  America is a conglomeration of a bunch of immigrants' cultures put together.
[01:53:15.467 --> 01:53:17.467]  And it, I believe, is better for it.
[01:53:17.647 --> 01:53:21.168]  It is the superior culture on the planet, I think, as a result.
[01:53:21.388 --> 01:53:26.472]  And it's the government that's the problem, and Mark doesn't speak for me when he answered his question about less government, less government.
[01:53:26.673 --> 01:53:36.481]  That may be the way we get to no coercive government, but I myself, and I'm going to make it straight out here, I am not in favor of coercion between human beings, between peaceful people.
[01:53:36.501 --> 01:53:38.243]  Peaceful people should not be aggressed against.
[01:53:38.703 --> 01:53:39.384]  No, it's never okay.
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:01.921]  Canadians coming south.
[01:54:02.182 --> 01:54:11.032]  Sure, but if you try to stop the flow, you still get the coercion, you still get the tax dollars, but you focus them on bureaucrats, government agents with guns.
[01:54:11.272 --> 01:54:13.695]  What are they going to do with those government agents with guns?
[01:54:13.755 --> 01:54:17.279]  I'm going to tell you this, Ian and Mark, here's the deal.
[01:54:18.547 --> 01:54:23.910]  Austin police have told me to my face, and I've seen it in the news, that illegal aliens are God and I am a slave.
[01:54:24.611 --> 01:54:31.115]  So, I'm telling you, the illegal aliens are the client of the government, the big, wicked, evil government, loves the open borders.
[01:54:31.435 --> 01:54:33.036]  But I'm supposed to go, I'm a libertarian!
[01:54:33.676 --> 01:54:35.798]  And the illegals are like, take his guns!
[01:54:37.389 --> 01:54:39.031]  I mean, you know, I mean, that's how they're voting!
[01:54:39.051 --> 01:54:41.555]  You're not supposed to go, you know what, here's my gun, here's my gun.
[01:54:41.575 --> 01:54:44.639]  You're putting them all into one group and you're collectivizing.
[01:54:44.859 --> 01:54:52.009]  I'm not surprised that people from Mexico vote for Democrats rather than Republicans, because Republicans have certainly made them feel less welcome than Democrats have.
[01:54:52.389 --> 01:54:55.053]  I don't vote for either, but I understand how they feel.
[01:54:55.273 --> 01:55:02.159]  I think there are plenty of them who are outside the system entirely and they have no interest in the government, just like most Americans don't have any interest in voting.
[01:55:02.179 --> 01:55:06.202]  Well, let me ask you, is this the Quaker influence from up in New Hampshire?
[01:55:06.222 --> 01:55:09.885]  Because I know the Quakers were big in Metro La Raza, Liberation Theology.
[01:55:09.905 --> 01:55:12.407]  I mean, is there a Quaker influence to you guys?
[01:55:12.427 --> 01:55:13.648]  Because I think I've heard this before.
[01:55:13.928 --> 01:55:19.051]  Yeah, there's a Quaker influence, but we've had our beliefs as far as immigrants go back almost to the very beginning of the show.
[01:55:19.091 --> 01:55:19.731]  Yeah, but here's the deal.
[01:55:19.751 --> 01:55:24.594]  The Quakers of today are not the Quakers of General Green.
[01:55:24.854 --> 01:55:30.137]  Oh, I'm very, very familiar with the socialist bend of the Quaker meeting houses.
[01:55:30.477 --> 01:55:31.417]  I've got it completely.
[01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:35.619]  And I talk to them about those issues when we have discussions.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.120]  I hold their feet to the fire.
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:42.223]  I explain to them that they are against violence and the government is violent, so they can't be for the government.
[01:55:42.503 --> 01:55:43.444]  But they're not convinced.
[01:55:43.464 --> 01:55:48.451]  They just said, let us bring the foreigners in and we'll talk to you later, Ian, when you're in our FEMA camp.
[01:55:49.312 --> 01:55:55.881]  The only thing I've ever dealt with the Quakers on is the Haitian refugees and sending some money down there for people to get some food.
[01:55:56.618 --> 01:55:58.500]  Can we talk about obedience for a moment here, Alex?
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:00.702]  Obedience to my Lord Quaker?
[01:56:00.802 --> 01:56:14.016]  Yes, I think that's an important factor that needs to be touched on here because I think that what you said earlier, I like a lot of what you said, you know, freedom if we could have some sort of a society where there was a very small government or no government where people are
[01:56:14.256 --> 01:56:16.217]  Well, I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:56:16.277 --> 01:56:17.517]  It's like Tony Montana said in Scarface.
[01:56:17.537 --> 01:56:19.078]  He said, are you a communist?
[01:56:19.098 --> 01:56:23.740]  You want a Shavano in every corner telling you what to eat, what to wear, what to say, where you can go, where you can go?
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:26.281]  You know, I want my human rights just like the President Jimmy Carter says.
[01:56:37.405 --> 01:56:45.673]  And my issue with all the people south of the border is, that's most of the people coming in, the illegals, oh, thoughtcrime again, is that they are voting for big government.
[01:56:46.074 --> 01:56:46.855]  That's my problem.
[01:56:47.055 --> 01:56:50.058]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:58:56.499 --> 01:58:59.100]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:04.462]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:59:04.822 --> 01:59:06.562]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:06.863 --> 01:59:11.684]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:11.864 --> 01:59:12.845]  How much do you want?
[01:59:13.065 --> 01:59:13.785]  When do you want it?
[01:59:14.185 --> 01:59:15.766]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:16.067 --> 01:59:16.887]  When will you need it?
[01:59:17.128 --> 01:59:19.209]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:19.349 --> 01:59:20.430]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:20.671 --> 01:59:22.012]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:22.212 --> 01:59:27.276]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:27.476 --> 01:59:30.619]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:31.039 --> 01:59:34.540]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:35.861]  How much will you need?
[01:59:36.101 --> 01:59:36.701]  We don't know.
[01:59:37.001 --> 01:59:37.901]  How much do you want?
[01:59:38.101 --> 01:59:38.842]  All you can get.
[01:59:39.022 --> 01:59:39.882]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:40.122 --> 01:59:42.883]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:43.183 --> 01:59:45.344]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:45.364 --> 01:59:46.384]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:59.535 --> 02:00:05.503]  The preacher man says it's the end of time, and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:17.794]  We got Ian and Mark here, and I want everybody to sing Kumbaya, and humans are humans, and humans want freedom.
[02:00:18.774 --> 02:00:26.158]  The issue is the globalists, the statists, the collectivists, you know, the main generals of the New World Order.
[02:00:26.458 --> 02:00:27.799]  I'm looking at their battle plan.
[02:00:27.819 --> 02:00:30.581]  I'm looking at the holodeck rejection of the...
[02:00:31.261 --> 02:00:57.955]  of the individuals and people who want private property and how the enemy's attacking us and worldwide it's overrun Europe's borders overrun other borders whatever first world nation or if it's a poor nation overrun it with the next door neighbor who's even more poor to create debt to the bankers and so I just go back to this is a realist no country has ever survived
[02:00:58.925 --> 02:01:00.666]  With completely open borders.
[02:01:00.706 --> 02:01:08.309]  And I understand, you know, the whole Star Trek, Star League, we're all going to be libertarians in galactic deep space flying around together.
[02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:12.391]  But gentlemen, how do we get there then?
[02:01:15.650 --> 02:01:16.351]  How do we get where?
[02:01:18.893 --> 02:01:23.757]  We open the borders now, because that's the libertarian thing to do, and then maybe we'll get rid of the welfare?
[02:01:23.777 --> 02:01:29.202]  Oh, I don't see how the welfare system can continue to support an increasing burden upon it.
[02:01:29.722 --> 02:01:37.769]  I think the idea here that because we had a little welfare in the 60s and we have more welfare now, that we'll have lots more in the future,
[02:01:38.189 --> 02:01:44.713]  Is saying that because I was 5 feet tall when I was 10, that I'll be 20 feet tall when I'm 40, is just, it's not accurate.
[02:01:44.833 --> 02:01:48.656]  The system, the United States government is essentially bankrupt.
[02:01:48.676 --> 02:01:52.078]  It is on its very last wheel, squeaking along.
[02:01:52.358 --> 02:01:54.960]  And, you know, it can't support.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:01.744]  Its citizens cannot bear any increase in the amount, the burden of government.
[02:02:01.804 --> 02:02:06.267]  So, I don't know what's going to happen with the welfare system, but it isn't going to increase dramatically.
[02:02:06.547 --> 02:02:09.991]  See, and let me go back to your throwaway line, and it's a good throwaway line.
[02:02:10.051 --> 02:02:16.278]  No, no, just because you were 5 feet tall when you're 10 doesn't mean you're going to be 22 feet tall when you're 20.
[02:02:16.838 --> 02:02:17.999]  You might be dead when you're 20.
[02:02:19.181 --> 02:02:20.522]  You might die when you're 6.
[02:02:21.063 --> 02:02:26.449]  Because more often than not, when governments implode from too much taxes and too much regulation,
[02:02:27.009 --> 02:02:33.052]  Instead, they go into a hardcore tyranny and Mao Zedong kills 40 to 60 to 80, depending on the statistics.
[02:02:33.292 --> 02:02:35.554]  The Chinese say 84 million people.
[02:02:35.834 --> 02:02:38.235]  Or Joe Stalin goes hog wild or pull pot.
[02:02:38.535 --> 02:02:43.938]  And so, statistically, very rarely do we have a 1776 where it goes in a good direction.
[02:02:44.178 --> 02:02:45.759]  It normally goes in a bad direction.
[02:02:46.019 --> 02:02:55.144]  So, historically, when we implode here very soon and go into cardiac arrest, the maggots of big government are going to actually consume everything.
[02:02:55.464 --> 02:02:57.626]  Well, I don't think that you're going to... By the way, that's Mark over there.
[02:02:57.806 --> 02:02:59.487]  Yeah, it was me that made that statement.
[02:02:59.767 --> 02:03:01.308]  I don't think you're going to see that in America.
[02:03:01.368 --> 02:03:11.596]  There are as many guns in this country as there are people, and I just... You're not talking about Cambodia where people are trying to scratch a living out of the dusty earth.
[02:03:11.896 --> 02:03:22.684]  You're talking about a relatively wealthy nation, one of the wealthiest nations the world has ever seen, and its citizens are armed and have at least a modicum of the understanding of the ideas of liberty.
[02:03:22.904 --> 02:03:27.086]  Also, Alex, the idea that the country should survive, I think, is fallacious anyway.
[02:03:27.106 --> 02:03:28.988]  I mean, who really wants the federal government?
[02:03:29.088 --> 02:03:29.608]  They can have it!
[02:03:29.828 --> 02:03:32.390]  Right, I want nothing to do with the federal government.
[02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:39.894]  I think that as far as getting toward a smaller government slash free society, secession is going to be a very important step.
[02:03:39.914 --> 02:03:51.701]  So if the federal government doesn't implode within the next few years, hopefully some state government people will say, we've had enough, we're done with this, we're out of here, and then maybe that'll begin an avalanche of other people seceding.
[02:03:51.761 --> 02:03:52.261]  I can tell you that
[02:03:52.441 --> 02:03:53.821]  Okay, but let's talk Turkey.
[02:03:53.941 --> 02:04:08.686]  Generally in history when you have secession movements funded by the British twice in our history, it ends up being a move to break the country up to then bring those smaller pieces into a larger imperial union later.
[02:04:11.568 --> 02:04:14.710]  What really all this depends on is, in my opinion, a paradigm shift.
[02:04:14.970 --> 02:04:20.114]  And that paradigm shift is to shift away from the idea of supporting coercive governments.
[02:04:20.315 --> 02:04:24.838]  To that end, here at the upcoming Porcupine Freedom Festival in two weeks in Northern New
[02:04:24.838 --> 02:04:25.138]  I think so.
[02:04:52.854 --> 02:04:55.295]  But Karl Marx said the state would wither away.
[02:04:55.315 --> 02:05:00.836]  Yeah, Karl Marx believed that the state would wither away after growing it to the point that it encompassed everything.
[02:05:00.856 --> 02:05:04.217]  And I think we're going in the opposite direction of that, Alex.
[02:05:04.258 --> 02:05:07.298]  Yeah, they just legalized knives here in New Hampshire.
[02:05:07.318 --> 02:05:12.600]  So things are going in the right direction, even with the very initial phases of the Free State Project going on.
[02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:14.961]  And that comes back to what I was saying earlier about obedience.
[02:05:15.261 --> 02:05:20.843]  There's a civil disobedience and non-cooperation movement going on up here that I've never seen before in the Liberty Movement.
[02:05:20.863 --> 02:05:22.483]  The Liberty Movement historically has always
[02:05:22.503 --> 02:05:28.305]  He's just been, OK, we're going to run some candidates once every two years and four years, get 3% and then come back and run some more candidates.
[02:05:28.845 --> 02:05:31.245]  But we actually have people up here who are saying no more.
[02:05:31.925 --> 02:05:32.706]  I'm not going to follow you.
[02:05:32.726 --> 02:05:45.429]  Oh yeah, the libertarian, mainline libertarian movement, when they pick Bob Barr, who is a patriot on the surface, but when you really look at his votes, Mr. CIA, I mean, that is a joke.
[02:05:45.689 --> 02:05:54.295]  Yeah, well that's why I actually resigned publicly from the Libertarian Party before they chose Bob Barr, because I'd seen them going in a really negative direction for a long time.
[02:05:54.535 --> 02:06:02.161]  And so one of the reasons why the Free State Project was so exciting to me when I first heard about it, was because I knew the Libertarian Party wasn't getting any traction.
[02:06:02.441 --> 02:06:04.462]  And I knew that it had to be more than just voting.
[02:06:05.282 --> 02:06:07.523]  If voting changed anything, they wouldn't allow it.
[02:06:08.024 --> 02:06:08.864]  Clearly, you know this.
[02:06:08.924 --> 02:06:13.826]  I mean, you talk about the left-right paradigm all the time, and I know that you've been long out of that.
[02:06:14.327 --> 02:06:22.711]  But now I think we need to encourage people to get out of the government paradigm, the idea that there's some sort of benefit that can come from using coercive violence over other people.
[02:06:22.891 --> 02:06:24.371]  No, no, but I mean, listen, listen.
[02:06:24.932 --> 02:06:25.992]  I understand all that.
[02:06:28.133 --> 02:06:44.907]  And I appreciate you guys enlightening me or attempting to enlighten me on the deeper nuances of all this, but I've really looked at the angles myself, personally, and if I can use state governments as a step to block the federal government that's been
[02:06:45.527 --> 02:06:52.129]  Colonized by offshore mercantile corporate interests that are bigger than any government in the aggregate, you know, in the sum total.
[02:06:52.509 --> 02:06:56.851]  If I can, I mean, I'm in a desperate move here just to block total enslavement.
[02:06:57.151 --> 02:07:00.312]  So if I can use state governments, their 9th and 10th Amendment powers...
[02:07:01.132 --> 02:07:01.473]  Sure.
[02:07:01.533 --> 02:07:14.492]  To sabotage the federal takeover and to then get some fortresses built at the state level in people's minds to then demonstrate liberty and then move against the federal government.
[02:07:16.435 --> 02:07:18.656]  We can abolish it or whatever we choose at that time.
[02:07:18.676 --> 02:07:19.897]  See, that's the difference in mindset.
[02:07:19.917 --> 02:07:21.718]  I don't want to move against them or anything like that.
[02:07:21.758 --> 02:07:24.479]  I just want to live like a free person and ignore them.
[02:07:24.499 --> 02:07:25.820]  But see, that's not how it works.
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:27.280]  They're moving... Here's the deal.
[02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:29.461]  They're moving against the states and federalizing them.
[02:07:29.681 --> 02:07:40.046]  So when I say move against them, I mean take back the just powers of the states reserved to the people and to move against the tyrannical behavior of the feds to block their takeover.
[02:07:40.086 --> 02:07:41.367]  See, there's a takeover.
[02:07:41.567 --> 02:07:43.708]  The government is getting ready to stage nuke attacks.
[02:07:44.028 --> 02:07:44.568]  Very soon.
[02:07:44.588 --> 02:07:44.849]  I see that.
[02:07:44.869 --> 02:07:45.889]  Well, they've been taken over.
[02:07:45.929 --> 02:07:48.311]  I mean, the states have been beholden to the federal government.
[02:07:48.331 --> 02:07:53.835]  What are you going to do when Homeland Security sets a nuke off in Chicago and when they send men to your house to arrest you, pal?
[02:07:53.855 --> 02:07:54.915]  What are you going to do then?
[02:07:55.155 --> 02:07:56.336]  What's that got to do with immigrants?
[02:07:57.437 --> 02:07:57.777]  No, no, no.
[02:07:57.797 --> 02:07:59.318]  But I mean, we're having a larger... Well, I don't know.
[02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:01.019]  We're not just having tiny little discussions.
[02:08:01.199 --> 02:08:02.140]  I just don't know.
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:11.146]  I mean, if Homeland Security sends somebody to my house to arrest me, I will probably attempt to videotape it and stream it straight to the Internet.
[02:08:11.166 --> 02:08:11.787]  Best I can do.
[02:08:11.807 --> 02:08:12.887]  I mean, what am I going to do?
[02:08:13.087 --> 02:08:13.368]  Shoot them?
[02:08:14.128 --> 02:08:23.094]  But listen, let's see, what I'm telling you is we have this approaching giant flotilla of tyranny firing on us now.
[02:08:23.394 --> 02:08:24.835]  We are under attack.
[02:08:25.315 --> 02:08:31.759]  And it's great to talk about paradigm shifts into no state and to think of ourselves as total individuals.
[02:08:31.859 --> 02:08:32.739]  It's not just talk though.
[02:08:32.759 --> 02:08:36.422]  I'm actually trying to galvanize people into a movement of liberty.
[02:08:37.262 --> 02:08:47.350]  For smaller government, freedom, self-defense, anti-New World Order, in a desperate attempt just to stop the New World Order from completely taking over.
[02:08:48.501 --> 02:08:55.527]  Admittedly, I am for the idea that states are able to use their powers the way they wish.
[02:08:55.567 --> 02:08:57.749]  So in the case of Arizona, I'm kind of torn.
[02:08:58.110 --> 02:09:03.294]  I like that the state is saying that we're not waiting for the federal government on this issue.
[02:09:03.494 --> 02:09:07.818]  However, I dislike what they've chosen to do that, the issue they've chosen to do that on.
[02:09:08.138 --> 02:09:12.041]  And I think that it's ultimately not going to work because California essentially says
[02:09:12.822 --> 02:09:16.544]  The immigrants, come on in, and I guess they're giving them welfare.
[02:09:16.564 --> 02:09:21.127]  I don't know exactly what's going on in California precisely, but I do know that they're very friendly.
[02:09:21.368 --> 02:09:23.469]  I know, I don't want anything to do with California.
[02:09:23.489 --> 02:09:24.950]  That's why I agree with you, Alex.
[02:09:24.970 --> 02:09:30.133]  I mean, if people can use the state government to separate themselves from the federal government, I'm fully in favor of that.
[02:09:30.173 --> 02:09:32.695]  I'm fully in favor of the idea of secession.
[02:09:34.482 --> 02:09:36.003]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:09:36.063 --> 02:09:47.369]  I'm not in favor of secession if it's been like it has in Texas, where the media gives attention to some guy living in a cabin who declares himself president because his cousins voted him in.
[02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:57.815]  I mean, if we had the legislature move for secession, then I would gauge, as a citizen of Texas, whether or not I thought this leadership was good.
[02:09:58.155 --> 02:10:02.398]  But sometimes, in a secession, you end up getting something even worse
[02:10:03.078 --> 02:10:10.081]  Uh, and so again, I mean, it's, it's all... That's because it's about the paradigm shift here, and that's about the mindset that these are leaders.
[02:10:10.161 --> 02:10:11.722]  Politicians aren't my leaders.
[02:10:11.962 --> 02:10:14.824]  Not one of them has ever been, not one of them will ever be.
[02:10:14.884 --> 02:10:23.788]  And so if we get people together who are of that mindset, that independent, freedom-oriented mindset, bring them together to the same place, that gives them a level of influence they've never had before.
[02:10:23.808 --> 02:10:25.789]  Because right now, liberty lovers are distributed.
[02:10:25.829 --> 02:10:26.169]  They're all the
[02:10:26.249 --> 02:10:29.333]  Let me bring this up to you, because on the same subject of immigration, it integrates into that.
[02:10:46.313 --> 02:10:46.854]  I don't have an opinion.
[02:10:46.874 --> 02:10:48.775]  I've watched the videos and I think there's some really great questions.
[02:10:48.955 --> 02:10:50.976]  I mean the Building 7 thing is like a big question mark, right?
[02:11:05.848 --> 02:11:06.148]  I don't know.
[02:11:29.545 --> 02:11:35.950]  Buy DARPA to just fly over every city and spray us, and then we'll just be drones that go get on trucks and go to the incinerators.
[02:11:36.210 --> 02:11:41.534]  See, you guys are talking about free state projects, and I realize that the Globalons is basically what I call them.
[02:11:41.734 --> 02:11:44.356]  You know, these global eugenics mass murderers.
[02:11:44.837 --> 02:11:46.738]  They've decided that they want to kill everybody.
[02:11:47.439 --> 02:11:48.880]  It doesn't scare me, Alex.
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:52.983]  If they spray me, or if they spray you, what are we going to do about it, Alex?
[02:11:53.083 --> 02:11:56.626]  All we're going to be is mindless automatons, and we won't care.
[02:11:56.686 --> 02:11:58.227]  No, I'm going to have the will
[02:11:58.667 --> 02:12:02.309]  To expose them and have Chris Matthews attack me next Wednesday is insane.
[02:12:02.329 --> 02:12:03.750]  That's in the script.
[02:12:03.810 --> 02:12:07.472]  I've had more fun in the last three years since I moved to New Hampshire.
[02:12:07.712 --> 02:12:13.676]  I wouldn't care if they dropped a nuke on New Hampshire because at least I had a good time with other liberty-minded people.
[02:12:13.696 --> 02:12:14.376]  They're not going to drop a nuke.
[02:12:14.396 --> 02:12:15.117]  They're already floored.
[02:12:17.398 --> 02:12:21.019]  Water fluoridation's a kind of a squid-belly-kook thing?
[02:12:21.039 --> 02:12:23.060]  We don't even have it up here in New Hampshire.
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:24.400]  I'm really not sure about that.
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:30.703]  It seems to me that most people are cow-eyed drones already, so they don't need fluoride.
[02:12:30.723 --> 02:12:32.383]  Well, they've been getting it for 60 years.
[02:12:32.403 --> 02:12:37.525]  They don't have it here in Keene, New Hampshire, and they're not rising up against the New World Order.
[02:12:37.545 --> 02:12:39.526]  They're the same old normal humans.
[02:12:39.546 --> 02:12:45.108]  It's the government education, the indoctrination system that really... Well, sure, it's a complete cocktail overlay.
[02:12:46.568 --> 02:12:50.830]  Point blank, I've got the government documents where they said we're going to put fluoride in the water to brain damage them.
[02:12:52.311 --> 02:12:54.312]  It's really a matter of an approach, Alex.
[02:12:54.512 --> 02:13:05.417]  One of the big differences, I think, between our shows is that we approach, you know, we talk about the police state stuff like you do, but we approach things from, you know, what can we do now to achieve liberty in our lifetime?
[02:13:05.437 --> 02:13:06.338]  Well, I'll tell you what I can do.
[02:13:06.478 --> 02:13:11.801]  I can explain to people that the scientific dictatorship running things is poisoning them.
[02:13:12.241 --> 02:13:13.982]  And if you can get somebody to wake up to that,
[02:13:14.662 --> 02:13:25.146]  I mean because we can talk about who the most radical libertarian is and who the most awesome, you know, I'm so anarchist I believe humans shouldn't even talk to each other.
[02:13:25.166 --> 02:13:30.828]  There's no doubt you've done a great job of waking people up and the question is what do they do once they've woken up?
[02:13:30.948 --> 02:13:33.550]  And my answer to that is stop going along with it.
[02:13:33.590 --> 02:13:34.431]  Stop obeying.
[02:13:34.471 --> 02:13:35.572]  Stop paying the taxes.
[02:13:35.932 --> 02:13:37.453]  Stop bowing down to their laws.
[02:13:37.733 --> 02:13:39.354]  Say no to the government people.
[02:13:39.374 --> 02:13:40.595]  That's why we've been advocating people's safety.
[02:13:40.615 --> 02:13:40.915]  Exactly.
[02:13:40.996 --> 02:13:46.199]  Why can't Austin, Texas, the people, because in polls the vast majority are against it, get the floor out of the water.
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:49.582]  Why won't more people go protest the national ID card?
[02:13:49.602 --> 02:13:50.262]  They're cowardly.
[02:13:50.423 --> 02:13:51.123]  They're scared.
[02:13:51.804 --> 02:13:54.566]  The government's a scary organization that hurts people.
[02:13:54.646 --> 02:13:57.568]  And so I understand why people are afraid to... And they want to be scary.
[02:13:57.588 --> 02:13:59.029]  They now admit it's all about fear.
[02:13:59.309 --> 02:14:00.930]  Sure, of course it's all about fear.
[02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:04.672]  Barack Obama just said that government is the monopoly privilege on the use of force.
[02:14:04.732 --> 02:14:10.535]  He said, I mean, to me that's essentially saying you go along with what I say or I'm going to kill you.
[02:14:11.336 --> 02:14:12.936]  So, I mean, no doubt about that.
[02:14:17.759 --> 02:14:24.004]  July 7th said the state has the monopoly of force and all guns for individuals must be banned.
[02:14:24.404 --> 02:14:25.545]  Obama just said that?
[02:14:26.226 --> 02:14:30.429]  Obama didn't say the part about guns being banned, but I'll send you the clip, Alex.
[02:14:30.469 --> 02:14:30.970]  I don't have it.
[02:14:31.230 --> 02:14:32.171]  I actually might have it here.
[02:14:32.351 --> 02:14:33.452]  Yeah, we might be able to pull it up.
[02:14:33.812 --> 02:14:35.573]  But yeah, he had recently said that.
[02:14:35.674 --> 02:14:37.155]  About fluoride, I want to play after this.
[02:14:37.215 --> 02:14:41.838]  What essentially sets a nation-state apart, which is the monopoly on violence.
[02:14:47.759 --> 02:14:48.459]  Play one more time.
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:52.482]  Which is a monopoly on violence.
[02:14:52.882 --> 02:14:55.023]  Monopoly on violence.
[02:14:55.643 --> 02:15:04.068]  That's what the state is and that's why it's so important to get the idea that it's good to be in control of the state or that the state can do good things.
[02:15:04.208 --> 02:15:06.129]  We just elect the right people.
[02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:06.970]  I'm not saying that.
[02:15:07.190 --> 02:15:07.890]  Can you play?
[02:15:08.210 --> 02:15:11.152]  No, we need to shrink the state by electing the right people that will
[02:15:11.212 --> 02:15:11.992]  It doesn't work.
[02:15:12.032 --> 02:15:15.654]  The state is designed to prevent that from happening.
[02:15:15.714 --> 02:15:20.896]  If that's going to work, it's going to happen in New Hampshire, where we get enough people together to make that possible.
[02:15:20.936 --> 02:15:27.539]  Because doing it in their system, the way it's been done for the longest time, hasn't gotten liberty-minded people anywhere.
[02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:37.183]  I agree with you that the mode of Gandhi saying no in many different ways every day is one of the surest ways to stop these people.
[02:15:37.463 --> 02:15:42.645]  We want to stop globalization, stop buying foreign goods like the Indians did to the British.
[02:15:42.685 --> 02:15:46.127]  So I agree with you there and I'm not saying you're wrong.
[02:15:46.827 --> 02:15:51.032]  I'm simply stating that it's so far past that.
[02:15:51.072 --> 02:15:58.100]  It's so, I mean, it's so diabolical that people need to really come to grips with how serious this is.
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:00.442]  But where did Obama say that A and B?
[02:16:01.083 --> 02:16:02.405]  Can you play the whole clip again?
[02:16:02.925 --> 02:16:03.486]  Okay, here it is.
[02:16:03.526 --> 02:16:10.291]  I don't know where it came from, but I'm sure if you... I'm sure if you look... It's on YouTube, and I'm sure if you look up the exact quote, you'll find it.
[02:16:10.331 --> 02:16:12.792]  You've got one of the best teams out there for research?
[02:16:12.852 --> 02:16:15.234]  We're just two guys doing radio... No, sure, we'll find it.
[02:16:15.254 --> 02:16:15.735]  We'll find it.
[02:16:15.755 --> 02:16:17.176]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[02:16:17.296 --> 02:16:18.637]  Play the full clip.
[02:16:19.197 --> 02:16:22.500]  What essentially sets a nation-state apart, which is the monopoly on...
[02:16:24.481 --> 02:16:30.185]  There you have it.
[02:16:30.586 --> 02:16:32.947]  And whenever you read globalist documents that's all they talk about.
[02:16:32.987 --> 02:16:34.408]  We have the monopoly of violence.
[02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:36.350]  And that's why they hate it that we're armed.
[02:16:37.611 --> 02:16:37.851]  Sure.
[02:16:38.552 --> 02:16:40.193]  You'll get no disagreement from me, Alex.
[02:16:40.253 --> 02:16:56.664]  It's just a matter of let's get people who are excited about liberty to come up to New Hampshire and join the free... I mean, if you understand what liberty means, and that is that people should be free to live their lives how they want so long as they don't harm anybody else, you're the kind of person that would be great up here in New Hampshire to get active for freedom.
[02:16:56.704 --> 02:17:02.047]  We've had amazing success with free staters, people who moved here for the Free State Project, getting elected.
[02:17:02.328 --> 02:17:04.089]  It's an election year again here this year.
[02:17:04.109 --> 02:17:07.551]  There are, I think, dozens of people running this time because now more
[02:17:07.551 --> 02:17:09.053]  More people are here than have ever been before.
[02:17:22.853 --> 02:17:25.015]  That's a common, it's a common objection.
[02:17:25.035 --> 02:17:32.741]  Well, I mean, I assure you, if you've got a bunch of individuals, there are going to be within that system groups of warlords and thugs that are going to come rob your butt.
[02:17:33.041 --> 02:17:44.470]  Well, Alex, I don't know how things were in the 18th century, but I think that we probably did need a more centralized government in the age where people rode horses.
[02:17:44.490 --> 02:17:44.950]  Well, stay there.
[02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:49.634]  Finish when we come back, because the city of Austin is a group of criminal warlords robbing everyone.
[02:17:50.134 --> 02:17:57.182]  And so we would be better with no government in Austin compared to the criminals we have robbing everything and the public drinking fluoride, sucking their thumb.
[02:17:57.442 --> 02:17:57.743]  Fact.
[02:17:58.003 --> 02:17:59.324]  Four million people in the U.S.
[02:17:59.364 --> 02:18:01.166]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[02:18:01.487 --> 02:18:01.807]  Fact.
[02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:05.371]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[02:18:05.691 --> 02:18:05.952]  Fact.
[02:18:06.292 --> 02:18:11.598]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[02:18:11.798 --> 02:18:12.138]  Fact.
[02:18:12.519 --> 02:18:16.302]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[02:18:16.643 --> 02:18:16.983]  Fact.
[02:18:17.223 --> 02:18:20.967]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[02:18:59.255 --> 02:19:01.478]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:19:01.578 --> 02:19:04.362]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:19:04.803 --> 02:19:09.549]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:19:09.909 --> 02:19:14.095]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:19:14.395 --> 02:19:16.758]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:19:16.858 --> 02:19:19.281]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:19:19.641 --> 02:19:22.184]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:19:22.544 --> 02:19:30.153]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:19:30.473 --> 02:19:35.738]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:19:35.878 --> 02:19:38.681]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:19:38.721 --> 02:19:42.184]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:19:42.425 --> 02:19:43.346]  And I got news for you.
[02:19:43.486 --> 02:19:44.787]  You're everyone else.

[02:20:59.122 --> 02:21:02.925]  I'll be back Sunday, ladies and gentlemen, with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:21:02.945 --> 02:21:04.146]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:21:04.527 --> 02:21:06.328]  is the abbreviated Sunday transmission.
[02:21:06.889 --> 02:21:08.911]  Got another article of it, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:21:09.071 --> 02:21:13.334]  Oberman slams Tea Party Senate candidate for voting against water fluoridation.
[02:21:14.295 --> 02:21:20.437]  I'll be back next week as well, and I promise I'm going to tell my producers right now, I'm going to leave a few days open next week with no guests.
[02:21:20.457 --> 02:21:25.118]  They've been doing a great job getting a lot of good guests, but I want some days to just take your calls on the oil spill.
[02:21:25.839 --> 02:21:26.359]  It's clear.
[02:21:26.479 --> 02:21:27.779]  Listeners want to discuss this.
[02:21:28.219 --> 02:21:28.940]  It's important.
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:44.051]  You know, in closing with you guys, one of you, because you guys' voice accents sound similar, Mark and Ian, but one of you was trying to finish up a point before I went to break, but then I wanted to ask both of you about the oil spill.
[02:21:44.531 --> 02:21:51.757]  Another indicator, another proof, just like Katrina and everything else, the government cannot and will not help you.
[02:21:51.897 --> 02:21:55.460]  Any money that they end up spending will be stolen by their cronies.
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:57.020]  Well, that's because they're a criminal gang.
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:59.081]  As you mentioned about Austin, it's not just Austin.
[02:21:59.121 --> 02:22:02.822]  It's every city, every town, every state, every, you know, and the federal government.
[02:22:02.842 --> 02:22:03.602]  They're all criminal gangs.
[02:22:03.622 --> 02:22:07.023]  They're the most successful gang in a given geographic area.
[02:22:07.043 --> 02:22:07.984]  That's what the government is.
[02:22:08.164 --> 02:22:14.266]  And so the fear that you were talking about before, this fear of, well, what if there's no coercive government anymore?
[02:22:14.306 --> 02:22:21.408]  If we get rid of the violent monopoly, then what about the other violent monopolies around the world coming in and raiding and pillaging and etc.? ?
[02:22:22.328 --> 02:22:35.904]  And the answer to that is that, as Mark mentioned before, there's wide gun ownership in the United States and if you look back with Hitler and why he didn't invade Switzerland, it's because people own guns in Switzerland and they just didn't want to mess with that.
[02:22:35.924 --> 02:22:36.985]  I totally agree!
[02:22:37.005 --> 02:22:37.385]  I agree with you.
[02:22:37.525 --> 02:22:39.506]  More guns, less crime.
[02:22:56.310 --> 02:23:03.512]  Are you even against a county where you elect a sheriff and then you tell the sheriff, you know, these are the guys we think are good deputies and aren't thugs?
[02:23:04.032 --> 02:23:05.973]  I want to have competing sheriffs.
[02:23:06.033 --> 02:23:12.715]  I want to have competition and protection where people can actually choose the kind of protection that they want to buy in the marketplace.
[02:23:12.915 --> 02:23:14.695]  Bring competition and you get better service.
[02:23:15.175 --> 02:23:17.756]  Instead of these corrupt cops, you get better service.
[02:23:17.776 --> 02:23:23.278]  So you're saying like have neighborhood associations where you opt in and that neighborhood has the security it chooses?
[02:23:23.298 --> 02:23:24.058]  That's a great idea.
[02:23:24.358 --> 02:23:30.157]  And then who do you take, say, a guy who's caught killing a five-year-old girl, who do you take him to?
[02:23:31.041 --> 02:23:32.882]  Private arbitration now.
[02:23:32.922 --> 02:23:34.543]  We're getting into a lengthy conversation here.
[02:23:34.563 --> 02:23:35.944]  I know you want to talk about the oil spill.
[02:23:35.964 --> 02:23:39.506]  But see, if he's caught red-handed, I do want him to have his little neck snapped.
[02:23:39.786 --> 02:23:42.068]  No, I don't suspect that there'll be a problem with that.
[02:23:42.208 --> 02:23:43.689]  I think most people feel the same way.
[02:23:43.729 --> 02:23:51.253]  I think most people are against child molestation, and so the private arbitrators that would be competing for justice would essentially understand that.
[02:23:51.273 --> 02:23:58.798]  So when you have competition in justice and you have competition in protection, then everything gets better because competition raises everybody up, etc.
[02:23:59.438 --> 02:24:02.342]  And there's a lot of good information at book.freekeen.com.
[02:24:02.523 --> 02:24:10.094]  There's a great book called The Market for Liberty from the 1970s that really gets into detail about private arbitration and market justice and things like that.
[02:24:10.134 --> 02:24:15.501]  And I would recommend that your listeners and maybe you yourself, if you have the time, check that out at book.freekeen.com.
[02:24:16.411 --> 02:24:17.452]  Absolutely, gentlemen.
[02:24:17.472 --> 02:24:18.993]  And what are some of the other websites?
[02:24:19.713 --> 02:24:23.595]  Well, freeking.com is my blog site, and that's where a lot of the activism is happening up here.
[02:24:23.615 --> 02:24:28.298]  People can also go to gcnlive.com and listen to the streams.
[02:24:28.318 --> 02:24:34.521]  There's also a Genesis iPhone app that's free that has all the talk shows, including mine there, and Free Talk Live.
[02:24:34.541 --> 02:24:37.323]  And you guys are on six days a week, just like I am.
[02:24:37.363 --> 02:24:40.085]  Well, it's been a really interesting conversation.
[02:24:40.105 --> 02:24:43.908]  I look forward to being on your show again and you coming back here so we can debate this.
[02:24:44.328 --> 02:24:46.230]  Where do you see the oil spill going in closing?
[02:24:47.370 --> 02:24:48.731]  I see it going all over the Gulf.
[02:24:50.293 --> 02:24:52.054]  The oil spill is more your billowack.
[02:24:52.214 --> 02:24:53.335]  You're the research guy.
[02:24:53.735 --> 02:24:55.036]  You've got the team for it.
[02:24:55.056 --> 02:24:57.118]  And I would really ask you, what do you think?
[02:24:57.138 --> 02:24:58.479]  Did the government do this, Alex?
[02:24:59.918 --> 02:25:01.099]  All the evidence points at it.
[02:25:01.119 --> 02:25:16.549]  We can't conclusively prove it, or it was complete negligence because you never have people on the rigs, the managers, the engineers, cussing at BP people for two weeks in front of... There's all these witnesses in the Coast Guard hearing that they were saying, this is going to blow up, you can't order us to do this.
[02:25:16.789 --> 02:25:22.873]  They should have said no, so they're still guilty as well, but the BP execs need to get in serious trouble for this.
[02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:24.435]  Gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[02:25:24.475 --> 02:25:25.115]  God bless you.
[02:25:25.175 --> 02:25:26.276]  Just say no to government, Alex.
[02:25:26.976 --> 02:25:27.617]  Just say no.
[02:25:27.737 --> 02:25:28.579]  Absolutely, buddy.
[02:25:28.599 --> 02:25:30.121]  I'm just fighting for the Republic here.
[02:25:30.441 --> 02:25:32.143]  Just trying to wake people up.
[02:25:32.203 --> 02:25:33.545]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:25:34.106 --> 02:25:34.606]  Stay with us.
[02:25:34.626 --> 02:25:35.427]  Great job, crew.
[02:25:35.568 --> 02:25:37.029]  Back soon.
