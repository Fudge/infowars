[00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:06.522]  Hello PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers and welcome to this special video report.
[00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:22.685]  My name's Paul Joseph Watson, editor of PrisonPlanet.com on this Sunday, June the 20th and this is the first of a series of these video reports which will be exclusively available to PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers.
[00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:30.126]  And the special bulletin today, obviously as you will see from the website, we have a big article up there at the moment,
[00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:44.313]  Um, and we're calling for a criminal investigation to be launched into BP, into the federal government and into Halliburton by the local authorities, by the state governments of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:01:07.471]  And in this presentation we're going to run through the plethora of mammoth, gigantic evidence that points directly at the BP oil spill being, in the very least, criminal negligence that was deliberately allowed to happen which led to the explosion and the oil spill.
[00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:26.716]  Or even purposeful sabotage of the oil well to engender the crisis that has followed and the political capital that the Obama administration has gained from it in pursuit of its carbon tax climate change agenda.
[00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:28.717]  And we're going to go into that shortly.
[00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:40.681]  People are outraged today with the CEO of BP, Tony Hayward, who is busy watching a yacht race today.
[00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:44.766]  He seems to be quite unconcerned about the worsening oil spill crisis.
[00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:52.615]  And of course, Barack Obama is playing golf after he took two vacations in the immediate aftermath of the oil spill.
[00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:56.097]  Busied himself playing basketball and what not.
[00:01:56.137 --> 00:02:08.344]  Today he's seemingly more concerned about playing golf than trying to solve this crisis even though he himself characterized it as being on a par with 9-11.
[00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:17.449]  Such a mega disaster that it needed addressing immediately and yet Obama spends most of his time on vacation playing golf or basketball.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:27.391]  And that just strikes at the root of how every effort to find a solution to this crisis has been lacklustre and half-hearted.
[00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:34.300]  We keep hearing this rhetoric about how bad the crisis is, how devastating it will be, and how it may drag on for years.
[00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.603]  But this is not being matched by the appropriate action from either BP or the federal government.
[00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:42.164]  There's a contradiction there.
[00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:49.971]  The doomsday scenarios that they're outlaying are not being met with the same kind of action from them personally.
[00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:58.377]  And in hindsight, we've collated the evidence and I'm afraid the verdict is in.
[00:02:58.918 --> 00:03:00.039]  It's become clear that
[00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:09.795]  Not only was there foreknowledge of the original oil spill, the explosion, the leak, and we'll go through that shortly.
[00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:28.529]  But the response to the oil spill, as you saw with Hurricane Katrina back in 2005, has been deliberately botched once again with federal authorities preventing local authorities, state bodies, from cleaning up the mess.
[00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.235]  Many of you will remember the Jefferson Parish President, Aaron Broussard,
[00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:52.544]  Who famously, after the Hurricane Katrina disaster, appeared on MSNBC's Meet the Press and started crying his eyes out talking about how FEMA, the federal government, had deliberately severed the communication lines to the local sheriff.
[00:03:54.705 --> 00:04:06.615]  Down there where Hurricane Katrina was going on, so the local police couldn't coordinate with each other, couldn't speak to each other, because FEMA was in there deliberately sabotaging the communication lines.
[00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:08.477]  Now why would they do that?
[00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:22.189]  Well, in the case of Hurricane Katrina, more power for the federal government, they were able to enact their gun confiscation, which was a mass training program for the wider gun confiscation that they have in store for all Americans.
[00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:26.064]  And it's the same with the BP oil spill.
[00:04:26.344 --> 00:04:35.765]  The worse the crisis gets, the more political capital Obama gathers in pursuit of his carbon tax agenda.
[00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:52.528]  Now, not only is there a lockdown on preventing state and local authorities from helping clean up the oil spill, and there's actually a new story out today, or recently,
[00:04:53.709 --> 00:05:05.395]  From Fort Liberty which talks about how the Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal had ordered the state's fleet of 16 vacuum barges to clean up oil in the Louisiana marshes.
[00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:07.336]  What happened was basically the U.S.
[00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:12.259]  Coast Guard interrupted them and said, turn back and go home.
[00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:37.812]  So, this, allied with numerous other examples which are linked to in the article on the website, which is thoroughly documented with mainstream sources illustrating every point we make, federal authorities are once again preventing state and local officials from getting the job done and cleaning up this crisis, because they want to control everything surrounding the disaster.
[00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:39.152]  Case in point,
[00:05:40.905 --> 00:05:49.311]  They've erected an information blockade around the disaster, both BP and the federal government.
[00:05:50.632 --> 00:05:58.758]  Reporters have been harassed, threatened with arrest and prevented from accessing the beaches and the affected areas.
[00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:08.585]  We have a YouTube video where a CBS reporter attempts to get an interview with some of the cleanup crew and he's basically told that
[00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:20.248]  They're not allowed to talk to him, even though one of the spokesmen for BP in a letter two days previously said that the media would be allowed to talk to the cleanup workers.
[00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:36.334]  The media goes on the beaches down there, tries to talk to them, and they're threatened by these thug private security guards hired by BP, who have basically gagged the cleanup workers from uttering a word, because there's a blockade of information
[00:06:36.894 --> 00:06:50.201]  There's an information lockdown and a strictly enforced cover-up which is solely focused around protecting the official story and the official proclamations of exactly what's going on.
[00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:53.642]  They don't want the truth to get out, whatever that truth may be.
[00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:59.685]  And as we'll go on to see, it's the fact that this was deliberately sabotaged.
[00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:03.427]  So there's an information blockade.
[00:07:03.927 --> 00:07:04.248]  There's a
[00:07:05.484 --> 00:07:06.464]  Psyops going on!
[00:07:06.664 --> 00:07:09.745]  The Pentagon calls this psychological information warfare.
[00:07:10.266 --> 00:07:13.667]  It's intended to deceive and confuse the enemy, which is us.
[00:07:14.707 --> 00:07:30.312]  The public, the general public, the media, have all been blocked from accessing and accurately reporting information because the federal government, in alliance with British Petroleum, is engaged in a massive cover-up of information of what's truly taking place.
[00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:57.407]  and there's this insistence on refusing any help not only from local state officials and you know local authorities but even from foreign companies that have gone on the record to say they can fix this within two to four months we can fix it if you let us in to fix it but no
[00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:12.742]  Obama, under the Jones Act, which forbids foreign ships from operating between US ports, but can be waived in a national emergency, or in cases of strategic interest, which is exactly what this represents.
[00:08:14.183 --> 00:08:15.485]  But Obama's saying no!
[00:08:16.923 --> 00:08:28.971]  there are no less than thirteen countries who offered Obama help in cleaning up the oil spill one of which was Belgium through a company called D.E.M.E.
[00:08:30.012 --> 00:08:46.543]  which said that it has the five or six specialist vessels with the equipment required which the US does not have that technology they have the specialist equipment and the trained personnel to fix this oil leak to cap the well
[00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:54.379]  Within two to four months they said, we can do it, give us the opportunity, and Obama said, no!
[00:08:54.919 --> 00:09:07.127]  Because they want the crisis to get worse and worse, they want it to drag on and be prolonged until Obama can get his carbon tax through the Senate, which he's planning to do after the midterm elections in November.
[00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:19.553]  So, 13 different countries who are trying to help clean up the mess, and to every single one of them, there's a list on the website which you can see.
[00:09:20.653 --> 00:09:26.115]  Time and time again, Obama has said, no, we don't want your help, we can deal with it.
[00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:29.576]  Even though they're not dealing with it, they're playing basketball and golf!
[00:09:30.356 --> 00:09:31.816]  And in yacht races!
[00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:34.717]  You know, fiddling while Rome burns!
[00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:39.017]  So they've prevented the local authorities from helping.
[00:09:39.417 --> 00:09:44.900]  They've said, get out of the water to the foreign ships that are coming and saying we can help.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.642]  They've refused offers of help from Belgium and 13 other countries.
[00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:53.445]  Some of the countries who have the technology that can fix this within two to four months.
[00:09:57.205 --> 00:10:01.688]  From every indication they're prolonging this crisis and making it worse.
[00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:17.500]  And obviously this goes beyond Obama himself, you know, the ace teleprompter reader, who is a fine actor in that he's selling this hyped rhetoric of how bad the situation is while refusing help from anyone to fix it.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:24.425]  This goes above Obama and it ties directly into the globalist carbon tax agenda which we're about to cover.
[00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:35.395]  Now on May 27th, and here we're really getting into the evidence, the physical direct evidence of who caused this, the sabotage.
[00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:36.812]  If you prefer.
[00:10:37.812 --> 00:11:04.137]  May 27th, and all these articles are linked, so, you know, if people would like to see this on YouTube and say, oh, I don't believe that PrisonPlanet.com is not a trustworthy source, this is basically just a list, New York Times, CNBC, The London Times, several other publications which show that days before the explosion, we're talking days,
[00:11:05.814 --> 00:11:35.176]  BP, having been aware of cracks and problems with this oil well and this oil rig over the past several months, chose to use a risky, weak, salt water solution to seal the cement around the casing pipe, in preference to a stronger, heavier drilling fluid, which would, under any other circumstance, knowing that they've had problems with this rig, knowing that it's a safety risk,
[00:11:37.290 --> 00:12:00.718]  Should have been used, but they chose to use this weak saltwater solution, which, according to the New York Times, prompted heated arguments between BP officials and the crew members on the rig, who are obviously employed by Transocean, that's the company that owns it, according to Douglas H. Brown, who is the chief mechanic for Deepwater Horizon.
[00:12:01.398 --> 00:12:06.320]  So you've got people on the rig saying to BP, look, we've had problems with this for months,
[00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:09.945]  We've got indications that it's going to blow.
[00:12:09.965 --> 00:12:21.074]  And BP said, no, we use the risky, weak saltwater solution to seal this cap that's causing us these problems.
[00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:24.830]  This is a quote.
[00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:43.079]  Workers from the rig and company officials have said that hours before the explosion, hours before, gases were leaking through the cement which had been set in place by the oil services contractor, Halliburton, our old friends Halliburton, you know, Dick Cheney and the rest of it, the front.
[00:12:44.119 --> 00:12:47.620]  The Military Industrial Complex, Kingpin, Halliburton.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:57.182]  They were the ones sealing the well with this weak solution that all the rig workers said was a bad idea hours before it blew.
[00:12:57.882 --> 00:12:59.123]  This is Halliburton.
[00:13:01.103 --> 00:13:07.925]  Investigators have said these leaks were the likely cause of the explosion, reports the London Times.
[00:13:09.184 --> 00:13:19.907]  So, Halliburton, hours before improperly sealing this leak, which later, just a few hours later, causes the explosion.
[00:13:20.727 --> 00:13:29.829]  And, uh, Halliburton is named in at least two dozen lawsuits filed since the explosion as being to blame for the disaster.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.965]  Okay, so what motivation would Halliburton have for improperly sealing the well?
[00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:38.826]  Is it merely negligence?
[00:13:39.107 --> 00:13:41.268]  If it is, there still needs to be criminal proceedings.
[00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:56.141]  But the important thing about Halliburton is, just eleven days before the Deepwater rig exploded, the Deepwater Horizon rig,
[00:13:57.287 --> 00:14:24.378]  Halliburton bought for a sum of two hundred and forty million dollars a vastly experienced company that deals with the cleanup of oil spills that's right eleven days before Deepwater Horizon blew up after being improperly sealed by Halliburton they had bought this company Boots and Coops which deals with oil spill cleanups
[00:14:28.342 --> 00:14:34.328]  Take a rough guess who BP hired after the disaster to clean up the oil spill.
[00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:37.651]  That's right, no prizes for guessing.
[00:14:38.112 --> 00:14:39.753]  It was Boots and Coots.
[00:14:40.374 --> 00:14:44.298]  So now, with the oil spill cleanup contracts flooding in,
[00:14:45.575 --> 00:14:50.859]  Halliburton is making a killing off the oil spill that they caused.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.002]  Now, is that suspicious?
[00:14:54.062 --> 00:14:58.085]  Do you think that requires any kind of inquiry or criminal investigation?
[00:14:58.746 --> 00:15:00.447]  To me, it's a smoking gun.
[00:15:01.828 --> 00:15:03.309]  And to others, it's a smoking gun.
[00:15:03.329 --> 00:15:07.132]  A Raw Story did a big report on this, which we've linked to in the article.
[00:15:07.913 --> 00:15:14.979]  Quote, could Halliburton have known that an oil disaster was on the horizon and planned in advance to profit from it?
[00:15:16.127 --> 00:15:18.408]  News reports indicate they could have.
[00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:29.293]  Now, the New York Times again reported in May that BP was concerned about the rig's well casing, which Halliburton worked on, as early as June 2009.
[00:15:29.893 --> 00:15:41.838]  And they also report that a Halliburton employee warned BP three weeks before the explosion that BP's use of cement for the well casing was, quote, against Halliburton's best practices.
[00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:43.499]  So we've got multiple warnings
[00:15:45.976 --> 00:15:56.246]  That their methods in ensuring the safety of this well, which had been extremely concerning and the source of consternation for people working on the well, was completely improper.
[00:15:58.188 --> 00:16:11.240]  And now the company making a financial killing from cleaning up the mess was precisely the same company that Halliburton had bought 11 days before the disaster that lawsuits now say that they were involved in.
[00:16:12.503 --> 00:16:14.983]  Do you sense any notion of conspiracy?
[00:16:15.023 --> 00:16:16.044]  Of motivation?
[00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:16.864]  Cui bono?
[00:16:17.424 --> 00:16:19.544]  This needs to be investigated immediately.
[00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:27.646]  You know, would it be in their interest to properly fix these cement walls and seal the cap?
[00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:34.247]  Or would it be in their interest to leave it unstable and cause it to blow?
[00:16:34.907 --> 00:16:37.707]  As people who worked on the rig were warning it would happen.
[00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:40.548]  The motivation is clear.
[00:16:42.455 --> 00:16:55.273]  Now BP itself was also aware of cracks in the oil well as far back as February, which coincidentally at the same time was when the former BP chairman, now Goldman Sachs chairman,
[00:16:57.881 --> 00:17:17.356]  Peter Sutherland, Bilderberg member, big supporter of carbon taxes and global warming as well as BP CEO Tony Hayward were busy dumping their stocks so for months they knew that this rig was a problem and it could blow certainly if they continued the
[00:17:18.277 --> 00:17:22.878]  Unsafe procedures in fixing it, and at that time, they were all dumping their stocks!
[00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:28.039]  Does somebody need to look into this or what?
[00:17:28.379 --> 00:17:31.440]  You know, it's the Governor of Louisiana, Florida.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.900]  Are they interested in this?
[00:17:35.801 --> 00:17:36.441]  Alabama?
[00:17:37.401 --> 00:17:38.221]  Mississippi?
[00:17:38.761 --> 00:17:40.442]  Is anybody interested in this?
[00:17:40.842 --> 00:17:46.943]  The fact that the people who were directly involved in this disaster were all dumping their stocks!
[00:17:48.194 --> 00:18:01.723]  Weeks and months before it happened, with the knowledge that the safety procedures run by Halliburton, who had also acquired a company that would later financially profit from the disaster, were completely unsafe.
[00:18:03.504 --> 00:18:04.564]  This all ties in.
[00:18:05.365 --> 00:18:07.066]  This indicates sabotage.
[00:18:07.767 --> 00:18:08.007]  I mean...
[00:18:09.158 --> 00:18:18.468]  We're going beyond mere negligence when you find out that the people who knew that this well had a big problem had all dumped their stock in the weeks and months before.
[00:18:18.528 --> 00:18:19.349]  I mean, come on!
[00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:20.950]  Are we children or what?
[00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.273]  Can we not add one, two together?
[00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:28.769]  And we've got that report.
[00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:44.703]  Bloomberg got the documents which said that as far back as February, they were concerned about these fissures because if they're improperly sealed, this is what causes the explosive natural gas to rush up the shaft, which is exactly what happened.
[00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:55.492]  And allied to that, you've got Halliburton using this saltwater solution that's the completely improper method of doing this, especially in the knowledge that this is unsafe to begin with.
[00:18:57.017 --> 00:19:05.003]  So BP, Halliburton, they're aware of the cracks, they're aware of the fissures, but they're using improper methods.
[00:19:06.063 --> 00:19:14.870]  I mean, in this report it talks about how BP were losing a lot of this expensive drilling fluid because of these cracks.
[00:19:16.013 --> 00:19:30.144]  And then the later decision was made to use the salt water instead of the draining fluid by Halliburton because a. it was cheaper and b. I'm suggesting that they had no motivation in keeping this rig safe.
[00:19:30.465 --> 00:19:36.269]  They both financially profited in the millions and ultimately probably in the billions of dollars out of this.
[00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.752]  And all these links, all this evidence is in the article.
[00:19:40.192 --> 00:19:41.033]  Don't believe me?
[00:19:41.353 --> 00:19:43.015]  Go and go to the source.
[00:19:43.775 --> 00:19:44.416]  It's all there.
[00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.989]  And not only that, in terms of foreknowledge...
[00:19:52.051 --> 00:20:00.376]  As we've talked about before, the Deepwater Horizon managers knew that the rig had major problems before its explosion on April 20th.
[00:20:01.037 --> 00:20:19.469]  And the Houston attorney, big oil attorney who's won dozens of cases involving oil companies, he's got somebody on the record who heard a conversation between the Deepwater Horizon installation manager Tony Busby and a
[00:20:21.417 --> 00:20:22.918]  BP official in Houston.
[00:20:23.939 --> 00:20:43.796]  And according to this witness, who Busby's got his statement on record, Harold was screaming, Harold is this, you know, he's the manager on the rig, he was screaming to this anonymous BP official, as the explosion happened and as the rig was burning, quote, Are you fucking happy?
[00:20:44.037 --> 00:20:45.278]  Are you fucking happy?
[00:20:45.518 --> 00:20:46.779]  The rig's on fire!
[00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:48.781]  I told you this was gonna happen!
[00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:59.053]  They knew it was going to happen because it was being improperly sealed by the methods that were ordered to be put into place by BP and Halliburton.
[00:20:59.573 --> 00:21:01.834]  So all the people on the rig knew it was going to blow.
[00:21:02.174 --> 00:21:03.895]  It was no surprise to them when it did.
[00:21:05.643 --> 00:21:14.087]  BP and Halliburton, if the people on the rig knew it was going to blow, BP and Halliburton were the ones responsible for the safety procedures.
[00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:15.947]  Do you think they knew it was going to blow?
[00:21:16.748 --> 00:21:21.810]  So you've got guys on the rig, as it's burning, saying, I told you this was effing going to happen.
[00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:22.510]  Are you happy?
[00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:25.531]  Like they wanted it to happen.
[00:21:26.052 --> 00:21:29.473]  Because every measure to stop it happening wasn't done.
[00:21:34.747 --> 00:21:56.877]  In addition, we've got British Petroleum's own investigative report, if you go onto page 37, talks about how a hydraulic control system, which is designed to automatically seal the well in the event of an emergency, was modified sometime before the explosion without BP's knowledge or permission.
[00:21:57.757 --> 00:22:08.300]  So again, the fingers pointing at Halliburton, it doesn't mention who was responsible for it, but you've got modifications to the very equipment that is supposed to prevent this, in case of an emergency.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.441]  So again, it points to sabotage.
[00:22:15.942 --> 00:22:27.425]  As I mentioned previously, just like before 9-11 with the airline trade sinking, right before the attack, people made a lot of money out of that, Goldman Sachs, again,
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:43.446]  Now headed by Peter Sutherland, former chairman of BP, dumped 44% of its shares during the first quarter of 2010, during the precise time when they first became aware of the problems with this well.
[00:22:44.626 --> 00:22:51.689]  Now, after the explosion, BP shares have lost around 36% of their value.
[00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.251]  It goes up and down every day, but it's around, you know, 36%.
[00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:58.353]  That's $96 million!
[00:23:00.374 --> 00:23:08.878]  That's $96 million that Goldman Sachs have made on the back of dumping 44% of their stocks right before this happened.
[00:23:09.978 --> 00:23:11.419]  Should someone be looking into that?
[00:23:13.257 --> 00:23:14.018]  You be the judge.
[00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:20.282]  Tony Hayward, you know, is busy on his yacht race today.
[00:23:20.822 --> 00:23:28.167]  Current BP CEO sold 1.4 million of his shares in British Petroleum in the weeks before the spill.
[00:23:28.528 --> 00:23:30.309]  Does it indicate foreknowledge?
[00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.632]  That's why there needs to be a criminal investigation of this.
[00:23:39.764 --> 00:23:41.447]  So, why would they do it?
[00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:45.656]  Why would the federal government and BP, which are tied at the hip, as we shall see?
[00:23:47.679 --> 00:24:14.448]  Why would they not only allow the explosion to take place by not properly sealing the well, but why would they allow it to be prolonged by refusing the help of foreign companies who can fix the problem within two months, as well as telling state bodies, state officials who send out rigs to try and clean up the mess, telling them to turn and go straight back, just as in Hurricane Katrina, when the local authorities tried to respond.
[00:24:15.188 --> 00:24:16.629]  They were kicked out by FEMA.
[00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:19.410]  What's the motivation behind this?
[00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:33.275]  We've explored the financial motivation with BP and Sutherland and Hayward and Halliburton dumping the stocks, buying the company that is then contracted by BP to clean up the oil spill, in the case of Halliburton.
[00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:36.357]  But what's the political motivation?
[00:24:36.377 --> 00:24:37.057]  Well you know that
[00:24:39.589 --> 00:24:45.174]  Barry Sotero and the people who pull his strings, because he's just a teleprompter reader, doesn't control anything.
[00:24:45.754 --> 00:24:47.235]  Too busy playing basketball.
[00:24:47.816 --> 00:24:51.219]  You know, people like Rahm Emanuel, Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:55.062]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste, those kind of people.
[00:24:57.544 --> 00:25:00.486]  That's exactly what the Obama administration is doing now.
[00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:02.468]  We've talked many times about this
[00:25:04.232 --> 00:25:11.138]  Green economy, this post-industrial revolution, which will be heralded with the carbon tax.
[00:25:12.118 --> 00:25:22.206]  Now, the carbon tax over the past few months, certainly since the turn of the year, and Climategate, where global warming was completely debunked as the fraud it rightly is,
[00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:26.213]  The agenda for a carbon tax has been completely on the ropes.
[00:25:27.033 --> 00:25:29.474]  In fact, abandoned by many.
[00:25:30.715 --> 00:25:39.960]  We got the intel from the Bilderberg meeting recently which said that, quote, a Bilderberg member said, quote, we are just about whipped on climate change.
[00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:43.221]  So this was on the ropes.
[00:25:43.381 --> 00:25:44.442]  It was being derailed.
[00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:58.720]  But now with the oil spill Obama has had the opportunity to manufacture this contrived emergency as a justification to say we need to reduce our dependence on oil.
[00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:01.723]  We need to introduce a green economy.
[00:26:02.904 --> 00:26:13.173]  Now a green economy for Spain has equated to a 20% unemployment figure and 2.2 jobs lost for every one green job created.
[00:26:15.509 --> 00:26:17.269]  Now we've done reports on this before.
[00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:34.274]  If a similar green economy is introduced in the United States, and they call it a green economy, it's got nothing to do with the environment, the big oil companies, BP are pushing it as well, in unison with Obama, this is going to kill the economy.
[00:26:34.394 --> 00:26:38.755]  This is going to shave GDP levels to bring us back to a Great Depression level.
[00:26:40.476 --> 00:26:41.396]  The investigation
[00:26:43.795 --> 00:27:06.577]  into how it would affect America's economy if this quote green economy was brought in was devastating I mean take Spain and times it by ten this is going to be horrible now while Obama's claiming to kick ass and rein in the oil companies like BP BP itself is one of the founding members of the cap and trade lobby
[00:27:08.752 --> 00:27:11.133]  Look, Washington Examiner.
[00:27:11.773 --> 00:27:15.415]  Once a government pet, BP now a capitalist tool.
[00:27:16.475 --> 00:27:18.596]  This is the article that you need to read.
[00:27:19.657 --> 00:27:21.337]  Let's read a few passages from it.
[00:27:23.278 --> 00:27:34.603]  As BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig was sinking on April 22nd, Senator John Kerry was on the phone with allies in his push for climate legislation, telling them he would soon roll out the Senate Climate Bill.
[00:27:35.418 --> 00:27:41.442]  With the support of utility industry and three oil companies including BP!
[00:27:41.842 --> 00:27:50.347]  So BP is right behind the cap and trade carbon tax agenda and it's behind everything as this article points out.
[00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:54.930]  It's joined at the hip with the Obama administration and the Bush administration before it.
[00:27:56.144 --> 00:28:06.771]  Tax hikes, greenhouse gases, stimulus bill, Wall Street bailout, subsidies for oil pipelines, biofuels, which of course are completely devastating to the environment.
[00:28:07.431 --> 00:28:14.295]  They're killing species off out in the third world because they're chopping all the trees down so they can't feed on them for biofuels.
[00:28:15.036 --> 00:28:18.358]  BP's behind all of it in league with Obama.
[00:28:22.239 --> 00:28:36.749]  And in this article it says that one provision BP explicitly backed, this is in the Senate Kerry Climate Bill, according to Congressional Quarterly and other media reports, a higher gas tax!
[00:28:37.129 --> 00:28:41.832]  The money would be earmarked for building more highways, inducing more driving and more gasoline consumption.
[00:28:42.593 --> 00:28:43.393]  So there you have it.
[00:28:43.894 --> 00:28:49.597]  BP fully behind the Climate Bill, fully behind the global warming scam, fully behind the gas tax.
[00:28:50.871 --> 00:28:54.676]  And all the Liberals are saying, oh, Obama needs to deal with BP.
[00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.159]  When they're tied at the hip.
[00:28:59.042 --> 00:29:02.526]  Tony Hayward there, selling his stocks before the disaster.
[00:29:02.847 --> 00:29:06.051]  Peter Sutherland selling his stocks now with Goldman Sachs.
[00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:24.677]  Both Sutherland and Obama, obviously Bilderberg attendees, they're all joined at the hip and they're all prolonging this crisis A. for their financial agenda and B. for the political agenda, which is the carbon tax, which is the climate bill.
[00:29:28.118 --> 00:29:35.421]  Now, as we were talking about last week, Obama's indicated that he's now going to wait, he's going to introduce a weaker climate bill
[00:29:38.055 --> 00:29:44.137]  Quite imminently and then he's going to wait after the midterm elections in November then add the teeth, add the carbon tax.
[00:29:45.857 --> 00:29:55.500]  So he's got that gap in which he needs to build up the political capital to then exploit to add the carbon tax to the energy bill that would have already been passed in the Senate.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.622]  They're waiting until after November because obviously it's after the elections and then the heat is off.
[00:30:00.742 --> 00:30:05.363]  All these people can, all these politicians can freely stab their constituents in the back.
[00:30:06.023 --> 00:30:16.835]  By voting for this carbon tax, which is a consumption tax on their standard of living, and it's going to decimate any disposable income Americans have left in this economic crisis.
[00:30:18.036 --> 00:30:20.739]  It's a tax on the very substance we exhale.
[00:30:23.928 --> 00:30:48.167]  So he's got this period of time where he's going to wait until he introduces the carbon tax so between now and November only expect this oil spill to get worse because by every passing day, every passing week that it gets worse Obama can say we need to reduce our dependence on oil because look at what happened and this builds up the case for a carbon tax which BP wants!
[00:30:48.407 --> 00:30:50.549]  They've said they want it because it's going to hike
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.261]  Gas taxes!
[00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:54.402]  They're going to make a lot of money out of it.
[00:30:54.722 --> 00:30:58.104]  They're one of the founding members of the cap-and-trade lobby.
[00:30:59.505 --> 00:31:04.047]  Cap-and-trade systems are going to make them billions, if not trillions, in the long term.
[00:31:05.648 --> 00:31:08.010]  Obama's not fighting the oil companies.
[00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.511]  Come on, don't be stupid.
[00:31:10.892 --> 00:31:14.594]  Not the oil companies pushing global warming sceptics.
[00:31:15.334 --> 00:31:18.196]  All the damn oil companies are behind global warming.
[00:31:19.005 --> 00:31:19.665]  Google it!
[00:31:20.086 --> 00:31:22.367]  Globalists love global warming.
[00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:30.231]  All the oil heads, Peter Sutherland included, were right at the start all pushing global warming.
[00:31:31.852 --> 00:31:35.153]  They were all pushing artificial scarcity of oil and peak oil.
[00:31:35.974 --> 00:31:41.677]  Because if you create artificial scarcity as an oil company, what happens?
[00:31:41.717 --> 00:31:43.998]  The price of your oil goes up, you make more money.
[00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:55.154]  So we've got the financial motivations, we've got the hardcore evidence that there was sabotage within properly fixing this well.
[00:31:55.374 --> 00:31:59.856]  We've got the political motivation with the climate tax, the consumption tax.
[00:32:00.677 --> 00:32:16.325]  We've also got the fact that as a result, as a direct result of this oil spill, the plans for exploratory drilling in the Arctic, something which, you know, Obama had to pass through gritted teeth, has now been mothballed, it's been postponed
[00:32:17.628 --> 00:32:21.349]  And that all contributes towards this post-industrial revolution that they want.
[00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.471]  They want to shut down the oil industry.
[00:32:24.511 --> 00:32:30.493]  They want to turn us over to this green economy nightmare that's going to cause another Great Depression.
[00:32:31.853 --> 00:32:33.074]  And the longer this drags on,
[00:32:34.693 --> 00:32:36.494]  The more they move towards that goal.
[00:32:37.834 --> 00:32:43.776]  No motivation in preventing it from happening in the first place on the part of the Federal Government, BP, Halliburton.
[00:32:44.376 --> 00:32:49.178]  No motivation in fixing it, which is why they've rejected any help to do so.
[00:32:52.319 --> 00:33:02.303]  So now, we're in a situation where there's still at least 95% to 90% of this oil well of the capacity is still down there.
[00:33:04.181 --> 00:33:08.424]  I mean, people will say, you know, this oil keeps spewing, when is it going to run out?
[00:33:09.245 --> 00:33:11.366]  Well, anything up to four years!
[00:33:11.927 --> 00:33:14.989]  There's two billion gallons of oil down there, at least!
[00:33:15.749 --> 00:33:20.072]  If they don't manage to put a cap on it, this is going to drag on for four years!
[00:33:21.974 --> 00:33:25.716]  They've rejected the help from the Belgians, saying we can stop it in two to four months.
[00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.598]  Oh no, four years!
[00:33:29.864 --> 00:33:36.268]  And you know, there's a lot of sound research from the Russians into the abiotic nature of oil, especially in the Gulf region.
[00:33:37.529 --> 00:33:41.112]  So if that's true, I mean, God help us, because it could never end!
[00:33:41.952 --> 00:33:45.955]  If the oil down there is naturally occurring, this spill's never going to end!
[00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:52.940]  Unless... we expose the fact that the federal government's response has been to deliberately botch the whole thing!
[00:33:56.403 --> 00:33:57.964]  So we've run through the evidence.
[00:33:58.565 --> 00:33:59.546]  It's monumental.
[00:33:59.586 --> 00:34:00.267]  It's mammoth.
[00:34:00.707 --> 00:34:01.748]  It's in triplicate.
[00:34:02.108 --> 00:34:18.403]  There's a plethora of evidence to directly implicate BP, Halliburton and the federal government with foreknowledge, motivation for sabotage, and deliberate malfeasance, and in the very least, negligence.
[00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:20.625]  This is clear.
[00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:28.793]  We've waited on this for weeks, for months, for the evidence to build up and it's all pointing in this direction.
[00:34:30.233 --> 00:34:47.758]  Governors of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, we need an immediate criminal investigation into the role of BP, Halliburton and the federal government in causing the oil spill disaster, as well as their continuing cover-up of what's going on
[00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:58.603]  In addition to their efforts to block not only foreign companies from helping clean up the spill, but blocking local authorities from merely helping clean up the beaches.
[00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:21.945]  Now in the article posted on PrisonPlanet.com today, and this is going to be up all week in the News in Focus section, we've got the email addresses, we've got the phone numbers, we've got the addresses for the Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, and Mississippi Governor Haley Barber.
[00:35:21.965 --> 00:35:25.328]  We've got all the contact details, email, telephone numbers.
[00:35:26.509 --> 00:35:31.914]  Please help us in bringing this information to light, because we need an investigation into this.
[00:35:32.874 --> 00:35:34.415]  We need it done at the state level.
[00:35:34.696 --> 00:35:46.825]  We also need those local legislatures to conduct emergency sessions to usurp that power back that the Feds have taken from them, because they're not being allowed to clean up their own environment.
[00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:51.769]  It's the same thing that happened with Katrina, and you know where that led.
[00:35:53.055 --> 00:36:12.724]  Remember we talked about at the start of this broadcast, Aaron Broussard, remembering crying on Meet the Press saying, you know, I couldn't get to my grandmother, I couldn't get to my mother, they ended up dying, FEMA cut their communication lines, it was deliberately sabotaged by the federal government, that's proven!
[00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:20.588]  And every indication from this oil spill suggests that they're doing exactly the same, for all the reasons that I've just outlined.
[00:36:22.543 --> 00:36:40.522]  So please, contact the governor of these states, contact the local legislative bodies, be polite, but point them to the information contained in this article and demand that they institute an immediate and full criminal investigation into the role of BP
[00:36:41.943 --> 00:37:03.558]  Halliburton and the federal government in causing the oil spill and indeed exploiting it allowing the crisis to worsen in order to pursue their political and financial agendas to the detriment of the people in those areas people of America and ultimately in terms of the economy everybody around the globe.
[00:37:03.838 --> 00:37:09.301]  This is a criminal matter and all the evidence points directly towards in the very least negligence
[00:37:10.822 --> 00:37:14.365]  And the majority of it points towards sabotage.
[00:37:16.746 --> 00:37:19.328]  So we're going to leave this special video report for now.
[00:37:20.248 --> 00:37:33.657]  PrisonPlanet.tv members, of course, if you're not a subscriber, if you're watching this later on YouTube, which will probably come out on YouTube a few days after PrisonPlanet.tv members have viewed it,
[00:37:35.919 --> 00:37:37.400]  We're really beefing up PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.182]  You're going to have my special reports once a week.
[00:37:40.202 --> 00:37:47.107]  You're going to have special reports from Alex Jones at least once a week, which will only be available to PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers.
[00:37:47.927 --> 00:37:50.869]  You've got all Alex Jones' videos on there already.
[00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:56.933]  Daily archives of the video and audio archives for the Alex Jones Show.
[00:37:57.214 --> 00:37:59.815]  The live video stream of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:05.059]  All of this is exclusively available for PrisonPlanet.TV members, including
[00:38:07.455 --> 00:38:13.300]  Don't tread on me, Camp FEMA and all these other excellent documentary films from other filmmakers.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:25.849]  So it's a library of material and as you know it funds us, it allows us to put out these videos, it allows us to take the mammoth bandwidth bills for the website which are only increasing.
[00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:35.353]  So please check out all the material on offer at PrisonPlanet.tv and as I said, my name is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:42.415]  This is the first of a weekly video report I will be doing on a whole plethora of topics.
[00:38:42.815 --> 00:38:47.677]  Today we're talking about the BP oil spill, we're talking about the need for criminal investigations
[00:38:48.277 --> 00:38:56.906]  And now it's up to you to contact the local authorities in those areas, point them towards this evidence that I presented in today's show.
[00:38:57.267 --> 00:39:05.255]  The article's on the website, entitled State Needs to Launch Criminal Investigation into BP, Federal Government's Role in the Oil Spill.
