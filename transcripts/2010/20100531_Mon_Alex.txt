[00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:14.889]  All right, we're back live.
[00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.930]  We're now into hour number four.
[00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.612]  We have a guest coming up.
[00:00:21.612 --> 00:00:28.376]  I will intersperse some financial news and some treason news coming up during this interview.
[00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:31.177]  Very important treason news coming up.
[00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:35.179]  But right now, let's jam a few more phone calls in here.
[00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.740]  Up next is Michael in Colorado.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.861]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:42.689]  Hey, Alex.
[00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:44.190]  Yes, sir.
[00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.396]  Um, uh, to do with, uh, what you were saying, like, how the, they, uh, put things in front of our face before they, uh, execute the attack.
[00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:59.240]  Uh, like last year, I was watching Discovery and, um, it was, it was a show about, like, ice ages, right?
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:08.346]  So they, they get to this thing where they have all these scientists talking about the ice age and how they're actually talking about how there's an ice age coming instead of global warming.
[00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:09.756]  That's not the point.
[00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:13.298]  They were working on these satellites, right, with these reflectors.
[00:01:13.298 --> 00:01:27.343]  And they were saying that, um, with like four or five of these lights pointed at one spot on the ocean, um, they would be able to raise, uh, the global temperature enough to battle this ice age or whatever.
[00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:36.987]  And, um, but what they would need to do is have an oil slick on the ocean surface in order to bounce this ray into our atmosphere to bring up the temperature.
[00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:42.206]  Well, I know this.
[00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:52.214]  Now the UN is saying they're worried about global freezing, and we're supposed to forget about all their fake global warming, and they're teaching school kids we must stabilize the climate.
[00:01:52.214 --> 00:01:54.456]  The climate is always unstable.
[00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:57.698]  I mean, they're even trying to blame volcanoes on global warming now.
[00:01:57.698 --> 00:02:01.161]  I mean, I joked about that a few weeks ago about the Iceland volcano.
[00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:08.726]  They're now in the news saying, oh yes, thawing glaciers reduced pressure on the volcano.
[00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:10.667]  That has nothing to do with it.
[00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:15.970]  And by the way, glaciers worldwide in the last three years have been getting bigger!
[00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.273]  So, I mean, they say the Haitian earthquake was caused by global warming.
[00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:25.356]  They say the Chilean earthquake was caused by it.
[00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:28.178]  Because they know the public is kind of halfway paying attention.
[00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.454]  And, oh, you better pay Al Gore.
[00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:35.920]  But, meanwhile, Al Gore says he believes that the sea levels are going to rise in the next ten years and flood all the major cities.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.843]  He's bought two mansions on waterfront property.
[00:02:39.843 --> 00:02:41.966]  It's just made-up fraud.
[00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:50.073]  He got this big, demonic, fat, lying piece of trash that told us NAFTA and GATT was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:53.096]  And then he's up there saying, buy, pay him money.
[00:02:54.017 --> 00:02:56.659]  And he will save you from raising water.
[00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.081]  I mean, he's literally just a complete joke.
[00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:00.962]  I appreciate your call.
[00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:03.284]  Again, how did Napton Gatt turn out for you, folks?
[00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:05.525]  Well, remember, he was the one pushing that.
[00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:06.806]  He was the big spearhead on that.
[00:03:06.806 --> 00:03:08.487]  He loves conning people.
[00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:11.289]  He enjoys robbing you.
[00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:13.451]  Al Gore is a piece of trash.
[00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.892]  Chris in Boston, you're on the air.
[00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:15.352]  Go ahead.
[00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:16.173]  Hey, Alex.
[00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:17.014]  How you doing, man?
[00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:17.454]  Doing alright.
[00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:18.315]  Good.
[00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:23.179]  I hope you hear the word thank you enough every day, every week, because you're certainly doing a lot for our country.
[00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:24.220]  Well, I appreciate you, buddy.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.361]  I'm just trying to save my family.
[00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.822]  Go ahead.
[00:03:26.822 --> 00:03:27.042]  Me too.
[00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:29.684]  I have a ten-year-old son, so I hear that.
[00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:37.231]  I'm a musician, actually a conservative libertarian musician living in Boston, so you can see how that works out for me here in liberal Boston.
[00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:42.475]  Actually, Bob Chapman sent you a song that I wrote called Freedom.
[00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:44.176]  I was on a radio program with him.
[00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:45.838]  I'm not sure if you heard the song at all.
[00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:49.596]  You know, it does ring a bell.
[00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:53.216]  I mean, I've heard so much good music, I'll have to go pull it up.
[00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:54.277]  Is it on YouTube?
[00:03:54.277 --> 00:04:00.798]  Yeah, it's on YouTube, and you can look up, I think, April 28th, Bob sent you the email, the YouTube link.
[00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:10.000]  But I wanted to, you know, if you ever want to use that song in front of your movies, free of charge, I just want to be part of the cause, and, you know... What's the name of this song on YouTube?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.581]  It's called Freedom.
[00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:13.421]  Probably a lot of stuff under Freedom.
[00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.602]  Yeah, look up Chris Ross, Freedom.
[00:04:15.602 --> 00:04:16.702]  Okay, good, we'll check it out.
[00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:20.563]  By the way, I looked up American Spectator, and I had the quote.
[00:04:20.563 --> 00:04:23.904]  I'm not sure if anyone... What, by Rand Paul?
[00:04:23.904 --> 00:04:24.664]  Yeah.
[00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.184]  Yeah, give us the quote.
[00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:31.186]  He basically just said, as a United States Senator, I would never vote to condemn Israel for defending herself.
[00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:33.146]  And that's it.
[00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:38.688]  Well, yeah, and I mean, if Israel gets attacked, then they have a right to defend themselves.
[00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:41.963]  So how is that?
[00:04:41.963 --> 00:04:48.431]  You've got the left media, you've got the right-wing media, they're all establishment incumbents attacking Rand Paul.
[00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.932]  What does that tell you about him?
[00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:55.699]  I mean, when you've got the entire fake political spectrum attacking him, you know he's good.
[00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.421]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:04.541]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:10.943]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:18.325]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:23.207]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:35.573]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[00:05:36.112 --> 00:05:42.878]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:46.781]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:52.866]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1 to 2 month soap sampler.
[00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:53.146]  Thank you.
[00:05:53.146 --> 00:05:57.129]  You may be arrested and or subject to other
[00:06:04.272 --> 00:06:05.513]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.513 --> 00:06:09.395]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:11.696]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.696 --> 00:06:17.559]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:23.802]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.222 --> 00:06:30.165]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.165 --> 00:06:34.366]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:38.668]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.668 --> 00:06:44.610]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.172]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.172 --> 00:06:50.133]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:50.573]  It's here.

[00:07:07.036 --> 00:07:12.158]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:07:12.158 --> 00:07:18.819]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:20.902 --> 00:07:36.759]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.450]  Others don't.
[00:08:02.276 --> 00:08:08.900]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.962]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.962 --> 00:08:16.744]  Christopher C. Horner is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:20.806]  He serves as a senior fellow at CEI, Competitive Enterprise Institute.
[00:08:20.806 --> 00:08:22.307]  He's an attorney in Washington, D.C.
[00:08:22.307 --> 00:08:23.407]  Horner is representative of CEI.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.320]  We're good to go.
[00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:49.806]  How Global Warming Alarmists Use Threats, Fraud, and Deception to Keep You Misinformed.
[00:08:49.806 --> 00:09:00.928]  Greenpeace has repeatedly targeted Mr. Horner by stealing his garbage on a weekly basis, issuing press releases announcing with whom he dines, and including him in various other hysterical publications.
[00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:02.848]  Of course, they're funded by big central banks.
[00:09:02.848 --> 00:09:07.009]  They have a fleet bigger than major governments' fleets.
[00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.829]  They want your property.
[00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:10.770]  They want to guilt you into handing everything over to the elite.
[00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:22.816]  His new book is Power Grab, How Obama's Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:27.980]  Again, new book, Power Grab, How Obama's Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[00:09:29.767 --> 00:09:34.589]  My issue here is rhetoric cannot describe how bad they are.
[00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:41.713]  I mean, you watch Audi commercials like Green Police, that's actually what they're doing in Europe and what they have planned here.
[00:09:41.713 --> 00:09:43.533]  This has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:48.616]  It's a bunch of control freaks running your life, controlling every facet of it.
[00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:52.180]  They know global warming's a fraud.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.922]  They've already moved on to other scaremongering.
[00:09:55.922 --> 00:09:57.483]  And they're not going to stop.
[00:09:57.483 --> 00:10:02.125]  And they've said, even if the Senate won't pass this legislation, they don't care.
[00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:04.406]  They're going to have the executive branch implement it.
[00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:07.008]  So, if they are successful, it's over.
[00:10:07.668 --> 00:10:08.209]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:32.871]  So much is going on.
[00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:49.261]  Let's get into, since we had you on two or three months ago, what's happened with the power grab, the fake environmental movement, and what new heads the Hydra has sprouted, and where all this is going.
[00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:54.524]  Okay, so about 11 months ago, the House passed this cap-and-trade bill.
[00:10:54.524 --> 00:10:58.447]  It was about 1,300 pages long, and they
[00:10:59.637 --> 00:11:00.759]  Obviously did not read the bill.
[00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:04.606]  They snuck in 300 more pages of buying votes at 3 a.m.
[00:11:04.606 --> 00:11:07.291]  the morning of the vote.
[00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.315]  And folks declared it dead in the Senate.
[00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:10.597]  And then something strange happened.
[00:11:11.367 --> 00:11:22.398]  People did get upset, and they had recently been talking about drill here, drill now, and we're sitting on the world's largest energy reserves, and the real national security issue is refusing to tap your domestic energy resources.
[00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:25.361]  We won't pass an energy rationing scheme, right?
[00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:34.790]  Well, about two and a half weeks ago, three weeks ago, Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, openly said to Washington Papers, Politico, and I think The Hill,
[00:11:35.618 --> 00:11:43.780]  That he was going to suspend the committee process in the Senate in order to cramp cap-and-trade down, but they decided they wouldn't call it cap-and-trade.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:50.882]  Reid said, several people said things that are very important, there are four people, Harry Reid, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, and Lindy Graham.
[00:11:50.882 --> 00:11:56.324]  Harry Reid said, well, this would entail the jurisdiction of almost every Senate committee.
[00:11:56.324 --> 00:11:57.564]  Now, pause and stop, why?
[00:11:58.214 --> 00:12:03.797]  Because it impacts almost every aspect of your life, including the Senate Finance Committee, which writes tax law.
[00:12:03.797 --> 00:12:06.178]  It's the biggest tax increase in our history, and so on.
[00:12:06.178 --> 00:12:11.161]  Reid said, therefore, obviously the four Deers would just get confused, he's going to write the bill.
[00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:19.845]  And he began bringing in constituencies, and that means not your listeners, by the way, it means even the chamber, and API, and green pressure groups.
[00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:23.167]  And he asked them, what do you need in order to support this bill?
[00:12:24.068 --> 00:12:30.832]  And he asked the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, what do you need to not run those television ads?
[00:12:30.832 --> 00:12:38.316]  Because both groups raised a lot of money to run ads educating voters on this energy tax, unless it gave them what they want.
[00:12:39.102 --> 00:12:48.167]  And so far it appears they've probably got what they want, which is essentially a gas tax on top of the light switch tax to funnel money to projects.
[00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:54.290]  And now they're claiming, I've heard them on the news, oh there's a new bill in the Senate to fund the cleanup in the Gulf.
[00:12:54.290 --> 00:13:00.113]  How convenient that this BP spill happened when they're one of the biggest pushers of the carbon tax.
[00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:07.377]  And how convenient they wouldn't put the booms in early in Louisiana and Mississippi and Florida and are letting the oil come in.
[00:13:07.797 --> 00:13:10.283]  Oh, I'm afraid they have to have their taxes now.
[00:13:10.283 --> 00:13:11.787]  Let me tell you something.
[00:13:11.787 --> 00:13:13.771]  I was in the room with BP.
[00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:15.636]  I sat in for a gentleman named Ken Lay.
[00:13:16.283 --> 00:13:25.767]  Thirteen years ago this month, I was, as I've discussed with you, very briefly, I was the Director of Federal Government Relations for a company called Enron.
[00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:31.829]  And my number one priority, I was told, after I took the job, was to get a global warming treaty and a domestic cap and trade scheme.
[00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:37.291]  And the company they developed it with was BP, and they had set up this market with Goldman Sachs.
[00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:37.452]  Oh!
[00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:39.212]  This does fit very conveniently.
[00:13:39.212 --> 00:13:45.855]  Look, I understand how it fits into the narrative today, but you have to understand, I was the crazy guy on the street corner muttering about this for about
[00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.084]  Six years before anybody... Oh, wait a second!
[00:13:49.084 --> 00:13:49.604]  I got it!
[00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:51.086]  It's called rent-seeking.
[00:13:51.086 --> 00:14:02.297]  These businesses trying to make money the old-fashioned way by having their buddies in government agree to take some of their power in return for a guaranteed opposition to competition and a wealth transfer from you and me to them.
[00:14:02.297 --> 00:14:08.483]  So they bought all these uneconomic industries like Enron had the world's largest windmill company they bought on the cheap.
[00:14:08.483 --> 00:14:09.865]  It's now called GE Wind.
[00:14:10.592 --> 00:14:11.852]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:13.973]  BP will pay a billion dollar fine.
[00:14:13.973 --> 00:14:17.073]  They've already made that in increased oil prices.
[00:14:17.073 --> 00:14:20.834]  And then, now they'll get more liability protection from government.
[00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:23.995]  Their competition won't be able to drill in the Gulf.
[00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:29.136]  It's just like FEMA got more power by screwing up what happened in Katrina.
[00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:30.116]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:14:30.116 --> 00:14:36.737]  It's pretty clear that, well, in the public record, that the Green Groups, actually, with whom I met, by the way, that same day, in the same room,
[00:14:37.546 --> 00:14:40.928]  They were groups like Union of Concerned Scientists and Natural Resources Defense Council.
[00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:43.670]  They were Baptist and bootlegger coalitions.
[00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:54.396]  The green groups after the BP, after the well exploded, the green groups were shrieking to the White House, don't you dare burn that oil off.
[00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:58.979]  And they screamed about consequences of burning, igniting the oil before it got too well mixed.
[00:14:58.979 --> 00:15:05.323]  Well, as I said actually on a TV show I think that night, or within a few days, you have to understand something.
[00:15:05.885 --> 00:15:26.635]  I could be as irresponsible as a lot of people were about Bush and just say, look, the administration, which by the way was BP's favorite political candidate over 20 years ago, the administration was just taking orders from its Green Group buddies and they want this to be as bad as it can possibly be because the damage, while real, is temporary.
[00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:28.856]  The tragedy was the 11 men who lost their lives.
[00:15:29.457 --> 00:15:32.821]  But this is a White House that says never let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:15:32.821 --> 00:15:37.626]  They even engineer crises like claiming a global catastrophe from global warming.
[00:15:37.626 --> 00:15:41.310]  And the Greens, of course, have never made money hand over fist like they have.
[00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:48.763]  And for those that don't know, and for those that don't know, if they would have ignited this within hours, there would be almost zero problem.
[00:15:48.763 --> 00:15:51.763]  Almost all of it would have burned off at the source.
[00:15:51.763 --> 00:15:56.985]  Carbon dioxide would have been put into the atmosphere, you know, much smaller than a volcano.
[00:15:56.985 --> 00:16:06.867]  Would have literally had almost no effect if they would have done what the old-timers did and set that sucker on fire until they figured out a plan to cap it.
[00:16:07.407 --> 00:16:20.979]  And now we know why 35 days later the White House has done everything they can to block this because now they're going to get their carbon taxes that Paul Volcker demands we must have to pay Goldman Sachs their bonuses.
[00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:22.420]  Now they're going to get it.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.382]  Let me tell you, okay, so we know what
[00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:29.134]  BP actually did engineer this, and the Greens are biting them as you knew they would.
[00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:31.075]  BP and Enron were in on this from the beginning.
[00:16:31.075 --> 00:16:31.915]  Again, I was in the room.
[00:16:31.915 --> 00:16:33.256]  There's no point denying it.
[00:16:33.256 --> 00:16:35.397]  The Greens did tell the White House, don't burn it off.
[00:16:35.397 --> 00:16:37.519]  We just know the White House said, don't burn it off.
[00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:41.161]  It probably is a co-incidence, and they weren't taking their marching orders from the Greens.
[00:16:41.161 --> 00:16:47.425]  But, we know BP's been pushing an agenda that John Kerry said, even after the spill.
[00:16:47.425 --> 00:16:52.328]  Ironically, he said, I've been working with these companies, BP and Shell, to write this law.
[00:16:53.007 --> 00:16:59.430]  He said this, it's again in the public domain, so Harry Reid said I'm going to suspend the committee process like with healthcare.
[00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:04.112]  John Kerry said I'm not going to call this bill cap and trade because I don't know what cap and trade means.
[00:17:04.112 --> 00:17:06.633]  Yes he does, and it has cap and trade in it.
[00:17:06.633 --> 00:17:15.537]  He just said it's mean if you call it that because of course, there's a memo I talk about in Powergraph written by Stanley Greenberg who was Bill Clinton's pollster.
[00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:22.257]  He conducted some polling, and he said to his clients, who are Democratic politicians, you have to do two things.
[00:17:22.257 --> 00:17:26.359]  Stop saying cap-and-trade and global warming, and start calling it something else.
[00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.399]  And then it might work.
[00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:29.580]  Don't change your agenda, just call the agenda something else.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.202]  Yeah, he called it our deteriorating atmosphere!
[00:17:33.202 --> 00:17:36.243]  Well, he said, here are the catchphrases that I've pulled well.
[00:17:36.243 --> 00:17:38.083]  Green jobs and clean energy.
[00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:41.645]  So John Kerry said, I don't want to call it cap-and-trade, I don't know what cap-and-trade means.
[00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:44.826]  It's a jobs and national security bill, clean energy, of course it is here.
[00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:51.735]  Joe Lieberman said, oh, I don't want to call it cap-and-trade because you remember the artist formerly known as Prince?
[00:17:51.735 --> 00:17:54.016]  Well, this is now called pollution emission.
[00:17:54.016 --> 00:17:55.057]  He said that.
[00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:59.040]  This is now called the pollution emission reduction credits or something.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.141]  He won't say cap-and-trade.
[00:18:00.701 --> 00:18:09.664]  Lindsey Graham said two weeks ago, oh, this isn't a global warming bill because global warming no longer exists as a reason to pass legislation.
[00:18:09.664 --> 00:18:11.245]  It's still the same bill.
[00:18:11.245 --> 00:18:12.926]  He still said he'd vote for it.
[00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:13.726]  He just took his name.
[00:18:13.726 --> 00:18:19.528]  He said, I won't be a sponsor because I'll get in all sorts of trouble with my constituents, but I'll still support it.
[00:18:19.528 --> 00:18:21.649]  But it's no longer the reason that it's always been.
[00:18:22.426 --> 00:18:28.094]  The point of all this is, where I begin with the book, nobody says cap and trade would detectably impact the climate.
[00:18:28.094 --> 00:18:34.002]  I repeat, nobody says the temperature after cap and trade would be any different than it otherwise was going to be.
[00:18:34.002 --> 00:18:35.685]  It's not about the temperature.
[00:18:35.685 --> 00:18:37.287]  It was offered in the name of the temperature.
[00:18:40.698 --> 00:18:45.984]  Of course it's about deciding who can have industry, who can have businesses, and taxing the hell out of us.
[00:18:45.984 --> 00:18:46.424]  Yep.
[00:18:46.424 --> 00:18:48.326]  And in fact, here's what I do.
[00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:52.250]  I begin by pointing out, we know it's not about the climate, so what's it about?
[00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.872]  Well, it turns out it's about power.
[00:18:53.872 --> 00:18:55.514]  It turns out that it is about
[00:18:56.368 --> 00:19:00.652]  They can't trust you with your various freedoms that they never thought they could trust you with anyway.
[00:19:00.652 --> 00:19:05.195]  And I've got quotes in here that are out there that, for some reason, nobody's running with.
[00:19:05.195 --> 00:19:06.116]  Carol Browner gave it.
[00:19:06.116 --> 00:19:21.609]  She's the energy and climate czar who had a phony position, that position, created for her because she could never achieve Senate confirmation and she would cause great political havoc, of course, having been a commissioner for the Socialist International, if Obama tried to get her confirmed.
[00:19:21.609 --> 00:19:24.692]  She was put into this phony position to lord over cabinet officials
[00:19:25.093 --> 00:19:28.354]  And she gave an interview to US News in March of last year in which she said...
[00:19:28.988 --> 00:19:37.854]  It's their objective to get to the point where the electric utilities hold back power from you, so that you'll still be able to cool your home, just not as much as you would like.
[00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:39.175]  Meaning what, Alex?
[00:19:39.175 --> 00:19:40.976]  As much as they would like!
[00:19:40.976 --> 00:19:42.177]  They're admitting it!
[00:19:42.177 --> 00:19:43.357]  Stay there, this is incredible.
[00:19:43.357 --> 00:19:47.680]  Let's come back and talk about the control freak Panopticon.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.563]  And Texas, I already had it put into my office that I couldn't say no.
[00:19:51.563 --> 00:19:57.206]  California, they're gonna remote control your thermostat, they're gonna run everything and surveil you.
[00:19:57.206 --> 00:19:58.247]  We'll be back with our guest.
[00:20:01.707 --> 00:20:04.711]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:10.059]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:12.102]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:16.869]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:17.209]  I think?
[00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:38.045]  We're good.
[00:21:00.868 --> 00:21:02.249]  Are you prepared?
[00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:04.550]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.931]  There is a difference.
[00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:11.814]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.
[00:21:11.814 --> 00:21:14.815]  All Tactown gear has been field tested by Canadian and U.S.
[00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:16.616]  forces, so you know it's tough.
[00:21:16.616 --> 00:21:17.596]  What kind of gear?
[00:21:17.596 --> 00:21:19.758]  72-hour survival kits as low as $55.
[00:21:19.758 --> 00:21:20.198]  Holsters for $21.
[00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:23.219]  I don't know.

[00:21:49.223 --> 00:21:51.025]  Tactowngear dot com.

[00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:53.347]  Again, that's 418-844-9111.
[00:22:01.864 --> 00:22:04.046]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:24.973]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:24.973 --> 00:22:30.958]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:34.601]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:22:35.121 --> 00:22:39.404]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:39.404 --> 00:22:45.367]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:48.909]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:50.890]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.011]  It's here.

[00:23:00.689 --> 00:23:01.710]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:07.254]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:23:07.254 --> 00:23:07.795]  I get it.
[00:23:07.795 --> 00:23:17.422]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:23:17.422 --> 00:23:18.583]  That's not what's happening.
[00:23:18.823 --> 00:23:27.290]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.693]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:23:30.693 --> 00:23:34.956]  For the realist, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:36.558]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:23:36.558 --> 00:23:39.961]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:44.004]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:23:44.304 --> 00:23:45.205]  You should, too.
[00:23:45.205 --> 00:23:46.365]  Find out what they know.
[00:23:46.365 --> 00:23:49.287]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:23:49.287 --> 00:23:49.347]  800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.347 --> 00:23:49.427]  800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:49.767]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:01.783 --> 00:24:05.106]  All right, Chris Horner's new book is Power Grab.
[00:24:05.106 --> 00:24:07.288]  We'll tell you how to get that before he leaves.
[00:24:07.288 --> 00:24:11.732]  It's very important info, but all his books are best sellers, so you'll see it all over the place.
[00:24:11.732 --> 00:24:13.554]  And again, I research this constantly.
[00:24:13.554 --> 00:24:15.415]  Everything he's saying is on record.
[00:24:15.415 --> 00:24:16.977]  He's bringing up Carol Browner.
[00:24:16.977 --> 00:24:19.759]  He's going to go over more of these, like, we'll control your thermostat.
[00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:21.201]  We'll run your life.
[00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:22.041]  We're your God.
[00:24:22.762 --> 00:24:24.543]  What about Elena Kagan?
[00:24:24.543 --> 00:24:27.764]  Over and over again saying, if we don't like your speech, it's banned.
[00:24:27.764 --> 00:24:31.005]  Or Cass Sunstein, or we're gonna get your guns.
[00:24:31.005 --> 00:24:36.107]  Or the White House science czar, we're gonna put stuff in the water to sterilize you.
[00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:39.828]  I mean, folks, I don't just say this, I have their white papers.
[00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:42.969]  Here's Elena Kagan, University of Chicago Law Review.
[00:24:42.969 --> 00:24:44.110]  I mean, I've got
[00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.891]  I've got the White House Science Czar's own textbook right here.
[00:24:47.891 --> 00:24:51.353]  These people, these people are in league with Hitler and Stalin.
[00:24:51.353 --> 00:24:53.834]  And I don't say that for rhetoric.
[00:24:53.834 --> 00:24:54.695]  Let me go back to my guest.
[00:24:54.695 --> 00:24:57.316]  Chris, you started reading her quotes.
[00:24:57.316 --> 00:24:59.737]  It's just, it's like a bad dream.
[00:24:59.737 --> 00:25:07.240]  I mean, how can these people be such dirtbags, so obviously evil, and such a threat to everybody?
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.042]  I mean, most people I know with money are fleeing the country.
[00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:10.422]  Go ahead.
[00:25:11.152 --> 00:25:19.599]  Well, the one thing that's never changed is their utopian vision, their dystopian yes-me, but this idea that they will organize society.
[00:25:19.599 --> 00:25:21.100]  What changes is their vehicle.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.001]  What's the excuse?
[00:25:22.001 --> 00:25:26.084]  What's the latest victim that has to be rescued from the horrors of individual liberty?
[00:25:26.084 --> 00:25:31.869]  And it was, of course, the worker, and the worker threw off those shackles, so it became the environment, which can't speak back.
[00:25:31.869 --> 00:25:32.670]  Wealthier is healthier.
[00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.450]  Wealthier is cleaner.
[00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.772]  They have to know this, but they really hate wealth.
[00:25:35.772 --> 00:25:38.434]  It's just the excuse, the latest excuse.
[00:25:38.434 --> 00:25:40.176]  Freedom brings wealth, so they attack your freedom.
[00:25:40.774 --> 00:25:42.016]  How badly?
[00:25:42.016 --> 00:25:46.120]  Well, alright, the President has given some speeches that in isolation just seem weird.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:52.788]  He said, of course, under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket.
[00:25:52.788 --> 00:25:56.432]  He said he would use it to bankrupt industries he didn't like.
[00:25:56.432 --> 00:26:00.457]  His quote was, coal, you know, natural gas, whatever the industries.
[00:26:00.877 --> 00:26:06.562]  Then he admitted it would be passed on to the consumer, and he said, and this will also raise billions of dollars.
[00:26:06.562 --> 00:26:17.390]  Well, in the book, I detail how I used FOIA to get Treasury documents that say, there was a memo written six days after Obama was elected, in which they said, he wants to do this, here's what we can do.
[00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.914]  And under the justification paragraph, they wrote, revenues.
[00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:27.078]  This will raise, quote, possibly up to several percentage points of GDP, parentheses, i.e.,
[00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.332]  Uh, the equivalent of the corporate income tax rate.
[00:26:31.332 --> 00:26:33.313]  Or corporate income tax.
[00:26:33.313 --> 00:26:38.077]  The corporate income tax, among the highest in the world, raises $400 billion per year.
[00:26:38.077 --> 00:26:45.642]  The biggest tax increase in our history, to pay off World War II, which was an expiring tax, it cost the dollars $107 billion per year.
[00:26:45.642 --> 00:26:47.704]  So we're talking about a spectacular amount of money.
[00:26:48.297 --> 00:26:51.338]  But they don't just want to steal your money, they want to steal your freedoms.
[00:26:51.338 --> 00:26:56.220]  He gave another speech in which he said that you can't eat what you want, drive what you want, or put your thermostat where you want.
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:06.443]  The specific quote was, we can't eat as much as we want, drive our SUVs, and keep our thermostats at 72 degrees at all times, and expect that other countries are just going to say, okay.
[00:27:06.443 --> 00:27:08.044]  Well, I didn't ask, okay?
[00:27:08.044 --> 00:27:15.446]  But B, what is the President of the United States doing obsessing about how much I can eat, what I can drive, and where I can put my thermostat?
[00:27:15.731 --> 00:27:20.497]  Well he's also playing us off against other countries and invoking hatred of us.
[00:27:20.497 --> 00:27:26.445]  It's like he had Calderon here last week saying, ban all our semi-automatic rifles and handguns.
[00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:29.049]  This is the Socialist Internationale.
[00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:30.050]  This is their mode.
[00:27:30.771 --> 00:27:32.993]  Well, sovereignty is not a big thing to them.
[00:27:32.993 --> 00:27:41.059]  They do believe that one way to skin this cat is through... Global governance is not the same as a global government, though the global governance crowd would of course love that.
[00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:44.182]  I'm just saying, he's a big proponent of global governance.
[00:27:44.182 --> 00:27:53.069]  What I'd like to do, if we can stay when I come back, is talk about the way they want to control your thermostat, and you're not going to believe the documents that someone slipped me.
[00:27:53.069 --> 00:27:56.712]  But he, the Guardian in the UK, Old Red herself,
[00:27:57.347 --> 00:28:08.678]  ...reported that the Obama administration was briefing European diplomats before Copenhagen that failed... Thank goodness... Oh yeah, no, no, they're gonna tax you for any amount and then they say in peak times they're gonna control it.
[00:28:08.678 --> 00:28:10.880]  That's actually... They're announcing that in California.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.981]  Start getting into it right now.
[00:28:12.517 --> 00:28:15.899]  Well, okay, well, they want to use these things called smart meters.
[00:28:15.899 --> 00:28:23.144]  Smart meters put the meat on the bones of what Carol Browner said when she said, we want to get to a system whereby the utility holds back power from you.
[00:28:23.144 --> 00:28:24.906]  Why would a utility hold back power from you?
[00:28:24.906 --> 00:28:26.847]  They're in the business of selling you power.
[00:28:26.847 --> 00:28:34.232]  Because there's physical scarcity, which this crowd is arranging, as I detail in the book, and because they've got a requirement that they hold back power from you.
[00:28:34.232 --> 00:28:40.897]  So the state is going to use the utility, according to the energy czar, to decide, she said, you'll still be able to cool your home.
[00:28:41.536 --> 00:28:45.421]  Just not as much as you would like, which means just as much as they would like.
[00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:54.193]  Well, it turns out, the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency, a woman who was Al Gore's CEO before she took this job, making $325,000 a year as a Green Pressure Group CEO.
[00:28:57.356 --> 00:29:03.022]  She divested herself of utility stocks because of course the appearances would be terrible if she didn't.
[00:29:03.022 --> 00:29:06.765]  But someone slipped me her financial disclosure documents and guess what?
[00:29:06.765 --> 00:29:11.270]  She held on to a half million dollars in a smart meter company.
[00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.531]  How about that?
[00:29:12.911 --> 00:29:33.961]  Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency, in charge of getting the smart meter mandate in, that Carol Browner says is the way, that you can't control your thermostat, the state will, and we've got a woman who held on to between $265,000 and $550,000 of smart meter company stock, in addition to another great good jobs company, her husband's.
[00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:35.182]  It's incredible, stay there.
[00:29:35.182 --> 00:29:38.464]  Folks, this is why I get angry, and you should be angry too.
[00:29:39.224 --> 00:29:44.267]  They're openly saying they're going to decide what temp your house is.
[00:29:44.267 --> 00:29:46.148]  Naked body scanners aren't enough.
[00:29:46.148 --> 00:29:48.149]  All their taxes aren't enough.
[00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:50.951]  Nothing is enough for these people.
[00:29:50.951 --> 00:29:52.352]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.352 --> 00:29:54.873]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.873 --> 00:29:57.555]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:03.630]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:08.951]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:11.012]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.012 --> 00:31:15.993]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:15.993 --> 00:31:17.194]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.194 --> 00:31:17.914]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.314 --> 00:31:20.196]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.196 --> 00:31:21.277]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.277 --> 00:31:23.480]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.801]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.801 --> 00:31:26.343]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:31.608]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.608 --> 00:31:35.192]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.192 --> 00:31:38.656]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:38.996 --> 00:31:40.217]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.217 --> 00:31:41.138]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.138 --> 00:31:42.238]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.238 --> 00:31:43.159]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.159 --> 00:31:44.260]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.302]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:47.302 --> 00:31:49.104]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.104 --> 00:31:50.004]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:00.455 --> 00:32:04.997]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.997 --> 00:32:09.339]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:14.641]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.838 --> 00:32:21.522]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:21.522 --> 00:32:25.104]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:25.104 --> 00:32:29.828]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:29.828 --> 00:32:32.589]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.589 --> 00:32:37.072]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:37.072 --> 00:32:40.935]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:41.195 --> 00:32:46.258]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:46.258 --> 00:32:50.420]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.201]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:52.201 --> 00:32:54.462]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:54.462 --> 00:32:56.963]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:56.963 --> 00:32:59.144]  We're going back to Christopher Horner right now.
[00:33:09.403 --> 00:33:13.407]  New book, Power Grab, Obama's Green Policy Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[00:33:13.407 --> 00:33:21.395]  But Matt Ryan for years, who's one of the TV slash radio board ops and producers, he worked at Austin Energy.
[00:33:23.288 --> 00:33:28.070]  And of course, he's talked about the meetings where they'd point out that the illegal aliens wouldn't pay their power bill.
[00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.871]  The city just said, let them have free power.
[00:33:30.871 --> 00:33:31.892]  I've talked to Austin cops.
[00:33:31.892 --> 00:33:34.193]  They're ordered to let them go, DWI.
[00:33:34.193 --> 00:33:36.454]  That's a separate issue, though.
[00:33:36.454 --> 00:33:40.515]  But I walked out during the break and I said, well, the city didn't ask us here at our business.
[00:33:40.515 --> 00:33:43.657]  They came and stuck the new smart thermostat on last year.
[00:33:44.537 --> 00:34:01.931]  And in the brochure it said, well, since your thermostat was free, businesses don't have an option, you know, free, taxpayer paid for it, we may turn your heat down in the winter, or your cool, you know, up in the summer, if we're having problems supplying power.
[00:34:01.931 --> 00:34:11.099]  Now that was the old Enron scam, where they got caught to create artificial scarcity, where they were showing congressmen and the state legislature fake computer trades on computers.
[00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:20.303]  They were just making up the price, and their internal studies showed if we double or triple prices, or even turn power off, that creates the perception that it's scarce.
[00:34:20.303 --> 00:34:22.825]  And now they're doing it with the water, with power.
[00:34:22.825 --> 00:34:25.886]  This Green Movement is about raping you.
[00:34:25.886 --> 00:34:32.109]  But I briefly wanted Matt Ryan here on air, I mean, plus we can dig up the Austin Energy contract, says it.
[00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:34.771]  I mean, I'd read this, but he goes, no, you're absolutely correct.
[00:34:34.771 --> 00:34:37.152]  Austin already has this.
[00:34:37.152 --> 00:34:41.074]  They already control this building's thermostat.
[00:34:41.634 --> 00:34:44.737]  I am under these criminals' control.
[00:34:44.737 --> 00:34:45.798]  Matt Ryan, tell folks.
[00:34:45.798 --> 00:34:45.978]  Right.
[00:34:45.978 --> 00:34:50.683]  These programmable thermostats are one of the green initiatives sponsored by Austin Energy.
[00:34:50.683 --> 00:34:51.704]  You call them up.
[00:34:51.704 --> 00:34:54.326]  They'll give you a free thermostat, a programmable thermostat.
[00:34:54.326 --> 00:35:00.932]  It'll work for you 24-7 around the clock, except during what they call peak usage times, which
[00:35:02.437 --> 00:35:29.052]  is a time period usually in the afternoon when they say okay well there's a lot of people turning their ACs on they can turn yours off and they will turn yours off for usually about 15 minutes during a day when they they feel that they're having peak usage and that's in the federal legislation to even control what what goes in air conditioners right just like your cell phone since 96 tracks you in real time they're designing the big brother grid but I want to tell you with this business we don't have a choice
[00:35:29.532 --> 00:35:31.073]  They are our lord.
[00:35:31.073 --> 00:35:32.233]  They are our king.
[00:35:32.233 --> 00:35:38.795]  I can't tell you how many times I got a call from an apartment tenant saying, why did y'all come out here and put this in?
[00:35:38.795 --> 00:35:40.496]  I do not want this meter in here.
[00:35:40.496 --> 00:35:44.617]  And it's their landlord that said, oh, programmable thermostats, that's a perk.
[00:35:44.617 --> 00:35:46.597]  We'll give it to all of our tenants.
[00:35:46.597 --> 00:35:51.379]  And whether they like it or not, and believe me, they would complain, they got an all-energy thermostat.
[00:35:51.459 --> 00:35:53.140]  I want to have you back and talk about this more in the future.
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.783]  I want to go back to Christopher Horner, but thank you for coming in and telling us.
[00:35:56.783 --> 00:35:58.765]  So Christopher Horner, here we are.
[00:35:58.765 --> 00:36:09.214]  I mean, I'm already under these people's control, and if they can naked body scan my kids to fly, if they can control the temperature in my office, I mean, literally, this is worse than the Soviet Union.
[00:36:09.997 --> 00:36:12.980]  What they're talking about is squeezing you at both ends.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:18.645]  They're trying to ration the physical supply, create physical scarcity where there should not be any.
[00:36:18.645 --> 00:36:21.927]  Remember, the United States sits on the world's largest energy reserves.
[00:36:21.927 --> 00:36:27.012]  We don't have physical scarcity that would lead to this sort of, in essence, micro-brown-out.
[00:36:27.512 --> 00:36:40.996]  But you're going to get to the larger point of brownouts, because we're following the UK's path of saying, no coal, no nuclear, we'll just build offshore wind farms someday, and then you're going to see them obsessing about the fact that when they get to the Olympics, they're actually not going to have the electricity.
[00:36:40.996 --> 00:36:47.238]  But what you've got here is, Browner is saying things like, okay, this is not just the smart meter that will tell us when you're using your energy.
[00:36:47.805 --> 00:37:02.088]  What, I guess, that Kathy's always also invested in with this company Landis & Gear, a Swiss smart mirror company, half a million dollars worth of stock, and just wait until she succeeds in getting those mandated in one of the biggest markets in the world.
[00:37:02.088 --> 00:37:11.770]  They're talking about also getting to the point, like Matt was discussing, whereby they can say, I'm sorry, you've been running your dishwasher too often, wrong time of day, closed washer, sorry.
[00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.891]  Carol Browner sold it in this interview to U.S.
[00:37:14.891 --> 00:37:24.195]  News as a savings to the consumer, and I just want your listeners to know they're saving a fortune in India right now, in Haiti, and all over the world by not using energy.
[00:37:24.195 --> 00:37:30.238]  But we live in the richest country in the world, sitting on top of the world's largest energy resources, but that means we have freedom, and they don't like it.
[00:37:30.839 --> 00:37:46.234]  Van Jones, the communist self-avowed communist radical, he said, this is a quote, also in the book, among many others, the green economy will start off as a small subset and we will push it and push it and push it until it becomes the engine for, wait for it,
[00:37:47.111 --> 00:37:49.473]  Transforming the whole society.
[00:37:49.473 --> 00:37:50.994]  Yes, he said that.
[00:37:50.994 --> 00:38:00.522]  It always comes down to this is the vehicle for doing to this terribly flawed transgressor of America that they have to fundamentally transform.
[00:38:00.522 --> 00:38:01.563]  This is the vehicle.
[00:38:01.563 --> 00:38:02.704]  This is the excuse.
[00:38:02.704 --> 00:38:04.326]  Your freedoms are simply nothing.
[00:38:04.326 --> 00:38:04.906]  You can be trusted.
[00:38:05.246 --> 00:38:18.415]  And then meanwhile, Enron, and of course you briefly worked for them for about a month and you quit and exposed it all on record and valiantly so, they wrote the cap-and-trade carbon tax fraud, literally made-off level.
[00:38:18.415 --> 00:38:29.262]  Going back to California, they tried the same scam there, and in their memos it said, we turn their power off, then they perceive it's more valuable, they'll put up with a triple price increase.
[00:38:29.582 --> 00:38:32.763]  Ha ha ha, we're raping these schmucks.
[00:38:32.763 --> 00:38:37.966]  I mean, so you've got the big money, it's just not free market money, who wants this government monopoly.
[00:38:37.966 --> 00:38:45.469]  I think that's the key to defeat these little green devils, is to expose that they could care less about the environment.
[00:38:45.469 --> 00:38:47.470]  This is all a way just to run everybody's lives.
[00:38:48.046 --> 00:38:52.909]  Yeah, the temperature after cabin tray will be, according to everybody, whatever it would have been.
[00:38:52.909 --> 00:38:54.390]  So we know it's not about that.
[00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.871]  It's an excuse.
[00:38:55.871 --> 00:39:02.775]  And the point is, the President comes out there, and this is another quote, he said, some of America's biggest companies support this by way of saying, so it must be a good idea.
[00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:05.217]  Of course, that's usually his position, right?
[00:39:05.217 --> 00:39:09.819]  No one's ever asked publicly, okay, but why?
[00:39:09.819 --> 00:39:15.363]  Why is GE, which has Enron's old windmills, which nobody wants unless you mandate and heavily subsidize them,
[00:39:15.954 --> 00:39:21.142]  Why is the gas... Did you know the gas industry is actually running these ads calling for more windmills?
[00:39:21.142 --> 00:39:23.786]  Because more windmills simply mean more gas.
[00:39:23.786 --> 00:39:27.090]  You can't really dial a coal plant up and down to meet the...
[00:39:28.484 --> 00:39:36.113]  Oh yeah, they know the wind doesn't work, doesn't transfer the power.
[00:39:36.113 --> 00:39:37.255]  They love it.
[00:39:37.255 --> 00:39:39.838]  Exactly, the gas refining companies, they love it.
[00:39:39.838 --> 00:39:42.161]  They go, sure idiots, get rid of coal.
[00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:45.024]  Shut down what produces 51% of our power.
[00:39:45.024 --> 00:39:46.426]  Shut down our competition.
[00:39:46.426 --> 00:39:46.967]  We love it!
[00:39:48.749 --> 00:39:52.734]  Well, you're right about creating artificial scarcity.
[00:39:52.734 --> 00:40:01.446]  The seeming paradox of it, and business is pushing the idea of scarcity, but you also pointed out why businesses can benefit from scarcity.
[00:40:01.446 --> 00:40:06.353]  Now what I did in the book is I pointed out this is by no means, and it's obviously the world's second oldest profession,
[00:40:06.813 --> 00:40:25.337]  But this also has a very long history in the U.S., and there are left-wingers who point out that the history of the progressive movement was the corporate tie-ups to keep competition out, to lock in a nice livelihood for themselves with their buddies in government, and this is absolutely reminiscent of that for reasons I go into.
[00:40:25.877 --> 00:40:27.058]  We're good to go.
[00:40:40.185 --> 00:40:49.409]  But then they'll be the savior with your energy allotment if you're poor.
[00:40:49.409 --> 00:40:53.591]  Once they make you poor, now you're dependent on them and you'll vote.
[00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:55.832]  You want power in the winter, old lady?
[00:40:55.832 --> 00:40:57.553]  Vote to ban the Second Amendment.
[00:40:59.781 --> 00:41:01.223]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:41:01.223 --> 00:41:04.126]  This is a very big tent, probably for a lot of reasons.
[00:41:04.126 --> 00:41:11.113]  There's a strange thing going on when you look at why are the population zealots so supportive of this?
[00:41:11.113 --> 00:41:13.235]  Why are the fallen communists so supportive?
[00:41:13.235 --> 00:41:18.740]  The persistent communists, the Greens, the Reds, the pro-tax, the anti-development.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.143]  There is a very broad coalition here that I want to
[00:41:22.214 --> 00:41:24.216]  I want folks to think about this.
[00:41:24.216 --> 00:41:30.983]  Why is this extremely disparate group, along with some of, as the President said, America's biggest companies, pushing something?
[00:41:30.983 --> 00:41:33.506]  You're not at the table to get essentially screwed.
[00:41:33.506 --> 00:41:36.489]  They're negotiating you out of the deal, but at your expense.
[00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:37.991]  All of them have this agenda in common.
[00:41:37.991 --> 00:41:38.451]  Why?
[00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:40.914]  And the why is, again, the point of the book.
[00:41:40.914 --> 00:41:42.115]  This is a vehicle.
[00:41:42.955 --> 00:41:46.536]  For their long-held wish list of organizing society.
[00:41:46.536 --> 00:41:50.097]  And there will be trade-offs, yes, involved, and your life will be very different.
[00:41:50.097 --> 00:41:57.478]  And when they orchestrate collapse, on one level or another, it's true, they rush in with more state as the solution.
[00:41:57.478 --> 00:42:07.080]  Now, the President is lecturing Spain to cut it out right now, because he doesn't want them to drag us down, be the next Greece, and drag us down with them, because he's got a fundamental transformation to impose here.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.821]  But last week, in a Spanish newspaper, La Gazeta, there was a full-paged
[00:42:12.533 --> 00:42:20.181]  Yeah, I saw that.
[00:42:20.181 --> 00:42:21.522]  So here's the deal.
[00:42:21.522 --> 00:42:33.835]  Their globalization, their command destruction, their neo-feudalism has been too good at destroying things and so it's blowing up in their face before they get all the vice grips in place.
[00:42:35.632 --> 00:42:40.594]  I have to say that when the state controls power, the state controls an awful lot.
[00:42:40.594 --> 00:42:49.999]  And what this agenda does is transfer basic energy use and production and transmission, all these decisions from individuals, producers and consumers to the state.
[00:42:49.999 --> 00:42:53.761]  And when you do that, you are giving up an awful lot of your liberties.
[00:42:53.761 --> 00:42:54.841]  Now, I married a European.
[00:42:54.841 --> 00:43:01.925]  She's from a country where they have a joke, at least they're still laughing for now, that it's a good thing we don't have all the cars we pay for.
[00:43:01.925 --> 00:43:02.905]  Where would we put them?
[00:43:02.905 --> 00:43:04.506]  What they mean by that in Denmark is,
[00:43:05.464 --> 00:43:15.649]  Through the Special Assessment and the VAT, they have doubled the price of cars there, in order to force scarcity upon the public, because it's a wealthy country, and they would have all these cars.
[00:43:15.649 --> 00:43:16.329]  Oh, no!
[00:43:16.329 --> 00:43:17.670]  The statists didn't care for that.
[00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:23.652]  And so what they did is they, in effect, doubled the price of a vehicle to force the population out of automobility.
[00:43:23.652 --> 00:43:29.475]  Now, when you start letting go of automobility, pretty soon you'll find yourself letting go of control of every basic decision, like
[00:43:30.075 --> 00:43:32.017]  The temp, as you pointed out.
[00:43:32.017 --> 00:43:38.182]  Now when you let go of things like this, please don't be surprised when you wake up one morning and there's an awful lot more that's just gone.
[00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:39.851]  Well, no.
[00:43:39.851 --> 00:43:47.935]  I mean, the social engineers admit that they want to have one-child policy, that they want to decide what we're going to be when we grow up.
[00:43:47.935 --> 00:43:52.878]  They're literally organizing all of human society in a nightmarish way.
[00:43:52.878 --> 00:43:57.200]  I mean, we know when people try to organize things, you know, from top down, it always is a disaster.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.081]  But they want to wreck things.
[00:43:59.081 --> 00:44:02.383]  And that's my next question to you, because you're, you know, an insider who really studies this.
[00:44:03.423 --> 00:44:07.570]  Every incumbent, whether Republican or Democrat, is being thrown out of office.
[00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:14.240]  Whether it's Specter, whether it's what just happened with the congressional seat in Hawaii, whether it's Massachusetts, it doesn't matter.
[00:44:15.573 --> 00:44:19.518]  I've never seen such a realignment against the establishment.
[00:44:19.518 --> 00:44:23.924]  So they've really, you know, Obama was the fake revolution against Bush.
[00:44:23.924 --> 00:44:28.469]  Now people realize, my God, Obama is the real takeover.
[00:44:28.469 --> 00:44:33.796]  And so people are really, I mean, Zbigniew Brzezinski last week said our global governance is in trouble.
[00:44:34.376 --> 00:44:37.318]  He said, the people have finally woken up worldwide to us.
[00:44:37.318 --> 00:44:38.078]  We're now in trouble.
[00:44:38.078 --> 00:44:39.779]  I don't know if you saw that speech.
[00:44:39.779 --> 00:44:42.081]  But they admit they're in trouble.
[00:44:42.081 --> 00:44:44.302]  How do you see them striking back?
[00:44:44.302 --> 00:44:51.446]  I mean, because from every way I slice this, we are now really at the make it or break it crossroads.
[00:44:52.281 --> 00:45:08.023]  Well, there is a real push, and again, I was in the room in The Hague in November 2000 when Jacques Chirac gave his speech calling Kyoto the global warming treaty that covered 35 industrial titans like Iceland, Luxembourg, Belgium, Slovenia, Slovakia, but not China, India, Mexico, Brazil, and so on.
[00:45:08.784 --> 00:45:19.047]  I was in the room with some members of Congress and a few other Americans who were the only ones surprised when Jacques Chirac, who at the time was the President of France, said Kyoto was the first component of an authentic global governance.
[00:45:19.047 --> 00:45:33.472]  Jim Sensenbrenner is a Wisconsin Republican who marched outside and held an impromptu press conference, but I stood there watching the left-wing press swearing at him, the Guardian reporter was swearing bollocks at him, as Sensenbrenner said, if you want to keep us out of something, call it global governance.
[00:45:33.954 --> 00:45:46.119]  Well, I said the Guardian noted that Obama's diplomats were telling EU diplomats there may be a delay on Kyoto 2 in the United States because he's considering something called a Congressional Executive Agreement.
[00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:48.239]  That was, I heard you mention NAFTA before.
[00:45:48.239 --> 00:45:49.680]  NAFTA is precedent.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.241]  It's never been tried, the constitutionality of this.
[00:45:52.241 --> 00:45:53.541]  It did not get to this.
[00:45:53.541 --> 00:46:00.784]  But the issue of Congress waiving Article 2, Section 2 ratification, advice and consent, the two-thirds ratification,
[00:46:01.324 --> 00:46:05.767]  NAFTA was a treaty between three countries that Congress just said is not a treaty.
[00:46:05.767 --> 00:46:18.096]  And they granted something called Fast Track Authority, which is a suggestion of what should be in it, and a promise to give it an up or down, no amendment, no filibuster, 50 plus 1 vote in both houses.
[00:46:18.096 --> 00:46:25.241]  Now, if you do this, and the administration apparently is telling Europeans, we may have to try this because we're going to call Kyoto 2 not a treaty,
[00:46:26.075 --> 00:46:30.578]  You're going to have a problem because it's then left up to the courts and you know how activist they've become.
[00:46:30.578 --> 00:46:33.580]  But what you're talking about is you have one bite at the apple.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.961]  Don't trust the courts.
[00:46:34.961 --> 00:46:36.201]  You saw campaign finance.
[00:46:36.201 --> 00:46:38.163]  Oh, don't worry, the court will fix it.
[00:46:38.163 --> 00:46:38.963]  Don't trust them.
[00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:43.546]  What you have to do is block it at the granting of fast track for Kyoto 2.
[00:46:43.546 --> 00:46:45.387]  They won't call it Kyoto 2.
[00:46:45.387 --> 00:46:51.371]  They're going to call it Johannesburg because that's where the World Environment Summit is in 2012.
[00:46:51.371 --> 00:46:54.353]  They're actually going to try to get Kyoto 2 according to
[00:46:55.623 --> 00:47:06.006]  Lefty advisors to Obama, like this fella Nigel Purvis, who's counseling him, just declared this next key global warming treaty not a treaty.
[00:47:06.006 --> 00:47:10.087]  It's got all, it quacks, flies and does everything, oh and he's like a duck.
[00:47:10.087 --> 00:47:19.650]  But if you get Congress to say it's not a treaty, and the only difference is it means no two-thirds ratification, well that's your one bite at the apple.
[00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.010]  The courts aren't going to help you is my guess.
[00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.951]  And you have a 50 plus 1 requirement and it would take
[00:47:25.615 --> 00:47:38.841]  You know, you see incumbents being thrown out, but I just don't know, given the way, you know, you didn't see the Democrats... So they're going to come at us with a violation of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, treason, like this article.
[00:47:38.841 --> 00:47:41.563]  Top official says Feds may not process illegals.
[00:47:42.503 --> 00:47:44.384]  Referred from Arizona.
[00:47:44.384 --> 00:47:49.165]  So, you know, citizens have no rights, but if illegal aliens get arrested, we won't pick them up.
[00:47:49.165 --> 00:47:50.805]  So it's the same thing here.
[00:47:50.805 --> 00:47:54.746]  The federal government just doesn't care what we say or who we elect or what we do.
[00:47:54.746 --> 00:47:57.607]  They're just going to do it because they're God.
[00:47:57.607 --> 00:48:03.729]  Expanding on that and, you know, trying to see where you see this going.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:05.149]  What about the Republicans?
[00:48:05.149 --> 00:48:08.730]  I mean, you know, they've got a big hand in allowing this to happen as well.
[00:48:09.278 --> 00:48:11.119]  Yeah, you've got a problem.
[00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:21.363]  Right now, for example, this week, we're supposed to have a vote, just requires 51 or 50 votes, not 60, saying EPA does not have the authority to do this through the back door.
[00:48:21.363 --> 00:48:22.983]  This, of course, came through the courts.
[00:48:22.983 --> 00:48:24.244]  It was a 5-4 decision.
[00:48:24.244 --> 00:48:25.244]  We lost.
[00:48:25.244 --> 00:48:27.845]  I represented the skeptic scientists in this case.
[00:48:27.845 --> 00:48:37.909]  The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Massachusetts versus EPA, saying EPA has the authority, does not have to, but has the authority to treat exhalation as pollution.
[00:48:38.539 --> 00:48:47.984]  Well, there's a resolution by Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and she's saying EPA does not... Congress is allowed to vote veto major rules within 60 days.
[00:48:48.935 --> 00:48:50.836]  And she's saying no.
[00:48:50.836 --> 00:48:55.658]  The problem is it has 41 co-sponsors, 3 Democrats, and that means 3 Republicans have said no.
[00:48:55.658 --> 00:49:00.199]  They're from the Northeast, to no surprise, Scott Brown, and the ladies from Maine.
[00:49:00.199 --> 00:49:11.143]  Now, Scott Brown, during the campaign, said, climate change is, we all know this, what I don't want to do is something as big as what EPA is proposing, or cap and trade, without getting to the bottom of the scientific scandals.
[00:49:11.143 --> 00:49:14.404]  Well, I assure you we've not gotten to the bottom of the scientific scandals.
[00:49:14.404 --> 00:49:18.306]  I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the University of Virginia on Friday.
[00:49:18.826 --> 00:49:21.107]  I'm not sure how far we'll get, but we will litigate it.
[00:49:21.107 --> 00:49:24.768]  We're suing NASA probably this week for our own climate case.
[00:49:24.768 --> 00:49:25.908]  We're pushing this.
[00:49:25.908 --> 00:49:33.971]  But right now we've already got three Republicans in the Senate who have not co-sponsored a bill to say EPA will not do this to the back door.
[00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:41.193]  Instead, the world's greatest deliberative body, why, we shall deliberate on what will be the biggest intervention in our economy and our history.
[00:49:41.193 --> 00:49:44.054]  And you have three Republicans not just co-sponsoring this thing?
[00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:52.217]  You need to shut down the business of the Senate if the administration tries to do this through the back door and three Republicans have not codified it.
[00:49:52.217 --> 00:49:54.218]  Is that why they're so scared of Rand Paul?
[00:49:54.218 --> 00:50:00.180]  Because he gave that speech saying, we're not going to let you use fake environmentalism to shut our economy down?
[00:50:01.221 --> 00:50:04.503]  I'm sure he troubled some by pointing some things out.
[00:50:04.503 --> 00:50:16.690]  I was told by the Spanish green jobs professor, Dr. Calzada, in an email that ran Paul, in one of his acceptance speeches, pointed out that there's a new steel mill in Kentucky, the North American Stainless Plant, with 175 workers.
[00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:24.355]  I write about this in my book, Power Grab, in which those steel workers are jobs that are sent from Spain because of cap and trade and green jobs schemes.
[00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:26.096]  The CEO was very clear.
[00:50:26.096 --> 00:50:28.978]  He said, you can make windmills out of steel, but you can't make steel using windmills.
[00:50:28.978 --> 00:50:29.538]  I'm paraphrasing.
[00:50:30.362 --> 00:50:39.109]  But Rand Paul pointed this out, and I don't think people in Washington like to hear the idea that the state is not responsible for economic growth.
[00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:50.799]  Yeah, I mean, the grass grows, the sky is blue, the sun comes up in the morning because... because Barack Obama reads off a teleprompter.
[00:50:50.799 --> 00:50:51.319]  Stay there.
[00:50:51.319 --> 00:50:59.326]  Final segment with our guest, the new book, I've got to read it, Power Grab, How Obama's Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[00:51:01.533 --> 00:51:03.415]  Don't answer it!

[00:51:19.315 --> 00:51:23.597]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[00:51:53.901 --> 00:51:54.221]  That's 800-477-9256.
[00:52:00.458 --> 00:52:05.421]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.421 --> 00:52:06.422]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.422 --> 00:52:08.864]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:08.864 --> 00:52:09.884]  A republic.
[00:52:09.884 --> 00:52:12.526]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.526 --> 00:52:16.809]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.809 --> 00:52:22.373]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[00:52:22.373 --> 00:52:26.015]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.391 --> 00:52:30.075]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.075 --> 00:52:31.356]  You're being warned!
[00:52:31.356 --> 00:52:32.377]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.377 --> 00:52:33.538]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.538 --> 00:52:34.439]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.439 --> 00:52:35.340]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.582]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:37.861 --> 00:52:41.742]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.742 --> 00:52:46.704]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.704 --> 00:52:49.285]  A new tool in the Info War, Don't Tread on Me.

[00:53:01.448 --> 00:53:02.208]  The problem.
[00:53:02.208 --> 00:53:04.790]  How do I cook food without power?
[00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:07.511]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:10.193]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[00:53:10.193 --> 00:53:12.674]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[00:53:12.674 --> 00:53:21.419]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KeroStove.

[00:54:11.693 --> 00:54:17.356]  I'm Richard Horner, author, researcher, litigator, Supreme Court, advisor to Congress, new book, Power Grab.
[00:54:17.356 --> 00:54:29.824]  Don't forget our new video we're carrying, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, State's Rights Movement, Difference Between a Democracy and a Republic, available at InfoWars.com, or you can watch it online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:31.525 --> 00:54:35.409]  And your purchases of books and videos make this radio broadcast what we do here possible.
[00:54:35.409 --> 00:54:40.293]  So you've got big mega-corporations in bed with government to create monopolies.
[00:54:40.293 --> 00:54:44.417]  As John D. Rockefeller I said, competition is a sin.
[00:54:44.417 --> 00:54:48.581]  And this will destroy our free market system that's made this nation so great.
[00:54:48.581 --> 00:54:50.803]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:54:50.803 --> 00:54:52.225]  Chris, we were talking during the break.
[00:54:53.163 --> 00:54:56.166]  You pled, you know, many times before the Supreme Court.
[00:54:56.166 --> 00:55:12.280]  The arrogance level, though, I mean, I don't see Republicans opposing Elena Kagan, who is like Joe Stalin in drag or something, and then I was talking to you about what's happening with BP, and, you know, it just seems like it's a lawlessness, but give us your take on that in closing.
[00:55:12.756 --> 00:55:21.393]  Well, what we said before going out last time was the idea to many elected officials that Washington is not responsible for economic growth is anathema here.
[00:55:21.393 --> 00:55:24.098]  So somebody like Rand Paul, who's going to come up and say those things,
[00:55:24.953 --> 00:55:27.394]  Uh, it's going to be a troublemaker and isolated.
[00:55:27.394 --> 00:55:29.656]  You've got companies like BP who choose.
[00:55:29.656 --> 00:55:38.020]  Remember, their favorite politician in the last two decades was Barack Obama, a guy who swore to cause your listeners' energy prices to skyrocket.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.721]  BP had no problem with that.
[00:55:39.721 --> 00:55:43.123]  Obama swore he had no problem with high gas prices.
[00:55:43.123 --> 00:55:45.864]  He just said they shouldn't go up too fast for the obvious reason.
[00:55:45.864 --> 00:55:47.205]  People will start calling for
[00:55:48.386 --> 00:55:52.489]  Uh, policies that will allow us greater access to the greatest energy reserves in the world.
[00:55:52.489 --> 00:55:59.174]  So you've got a problem with these companies like BP that are a bit, look, they can have their public spats now, but it's not that much of a spat.
[00:55:59.174 --> 00:56:08.001]  BP remains in bed mostly with the left, sometimes with the right, uh, in Washington-style right, because they, like Enron, lost the plot.
[00:56:08.001 --> 00:56:15.506]  They began as an energy company and then they started to try to make money off of derivatives and windmills and solar panels and pushing paper and not making anything.
[00:56:15.506 --> 00:56:17.568]  They tried to make money off of doing nothing.
[00:56:18.115 --> 00:56:32.259]  Now, a couple of months after I left Enron in 97, there was an Oval Office meeting, August 4th, 1997, Sir John Brown of BP and Ken Lay from Enron, with the President of the United States and the Vice President Al Gore.
[00:56:32.259 --> 00:56:41.921]  And on August 1st, 1997, a Friday, in preparation for the Monday Oval Office meeting, there was a briefing memo written for Ken Lay, which is available online at masterresource.org.
[00:56:42.714 --> 00:56:43.854]  You can find it.
[00:56:43.854 --> 00:56:50.917]  In it, they say, okay, the unanimous Senate, I mean, the context was, a week or so before, the Senate had unanimously said, don't go to Kyoto and do this.
[00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:57.720]  So these two fellows, Ken Lay and John Brown of BP, go into the Oval Office, and they say, ignore that Senate.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.901]  You gotta go to Kyoto, and you gotta do it, and here's what it has to be.
[00:57:00.901 --> 00:57:09.424]  And since, obviously, we know who won that one, there's a memo also available at Master Resource, and I discussed it in my book, from Ken Lay's Kyoto advisor from Kyoto,
[00:57:10.916 --> 00:57:14.760]  Five months later, saying this treaty is exactly what we've been lobbying for.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:19.965]  So the unanimous Senate gets ignored when they say, look, you know, we go along with a lot, but not this.
[00:57:19.965 --> 00:57:21.726]  Not what Jacques Chirac calls global governance.
[00:57:21.726 --> 00:57:23.428]  Not an obvious wealth transfer.
[00:57:23.428 --> 00:57:25.130]  Not obviously rationing energy here.
[00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:26.691]  How has the Senate changed, though?
[00:57:26.691 --> 00:57:32.196]  I mean, they can see that everything Obama's doing is political suicide, and still it looks like they'll be able to pass it.
[00:57:32.196 --> 00:57:33.417]  I mean, are they all bought off?
[00:57:33.417 --> 00:57:34.278]  Are they blackmailed?
[00:57:34.278 --> 00:57:34.919]  What's going on?
[00:57:35.373 --> 00:57:37.255]  Well, Lindsey Graham's got so much pushback.
[00:57:37.255 --> 00:57:43.440]  He was the test case, and now the folks in South Carolina aren't happy with him, and so he says he'll vote for it, but he won't be a co-sponsor.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:52.248]  Look, progress, I know, as Cap Weinberger said about detente, if this is progress, we can't afford much more progress, but you start setting some examples here.
[00:57:52.248 --> 00:58:00.095]  When Democrats are running as anti-capitrators, as happened in the Pennsylvania race, in which they succeeded, when Scott Brown wins Massachusetts, saying in Cambridge,
[00:58:01.095 --> 00:58:01.556]  No, no, no.
[00:58:01.556 --> 00:58:03.937]  You don't do this to get to the bottom of what stinks.
[00:58:03.937 --> 00:58:05.999]  Of course, we don't know where he's going to vote on this thing.
[00:58:05.999 --> 00:58:09.842]  You are turning a very big ship of statism trying to steal your liberties.
[00:58:09.842 --> 00:58:12.504]  But read that book and listen to what they're saying.
[00:58:12.504 --> 00:58:13.324]  No, no, I agree with you.
[00:58:13.324 --> 00:58:18.508]  I mean, we're having victories that they're having to bait and switch now and aren't calling it cap and trade.
[00:58:18.508 --> 00:58:19.148]  Amazing.
[00:58:19.148 --> 00:58:21.250]  Christopher Horner, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.951]  The book is Power Grab.
[00:58:22.951 --> 00:58:24.532]  In stores all over.
[00:58:24.532 --> 00:58:25.873]  CEI.org.
[00:58:25.873 --> 00:58:27.174]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:58:27.174 --> 00:58:27.995]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:58:27.995 --> 00:58:28.255]  You bet.
[00:58:28.975 --> 00:58:29.675]  I'm out of time.
[00:58:29.675 --> 00:58:31.536]  Retransmission starts now.
[00:58:31.536 --> 00:58:37.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, standing up for humanity, for the interest of the people, for the Republic.
[00:58:37.958 --> 00:58:38.899]  God bless you all.
[00:58:38.899 --> 00:58:42.340]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.861]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.861 --> 00:58:48.202]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.523 --> 00:58:51.824]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.824 --> 00:58:57.407]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:57.407 --> 00:59:02.429]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:02.429 --> 00:59:07.472]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:07.992 --> 00:59:13.216]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:15.537]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:15.537 --> 00:59:20.340]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.461]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:21.461 --> 00:59:24.523]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:24.523 --> 00:59:28.146]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:28.146 --> 00:59:31.348]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:31.348 --> 00:59:33.569]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:34.490]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:38.112 --> 00:59:39.553]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:39.553 --> 00:59:47.180]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.104]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:51.104 --> 01:00:03.574]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:03.574 --> 01:00:04.155]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.853 --> 01:00:06.636]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.399]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.399 --> 01:00:09.981]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.524]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:15.730]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:19.777]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.849 --> 01:00:25.412]  It is Thursday, the 27th day of May, 2010.
[01:00:25.412 --> 01:00:26.993]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:26.993 --> 01:00:28.014]  We're into the second hour.
[01:00:28.014 --> 01:00:31.936]  We're now simulcasting the last three hours at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:31.936 --> 01:00:34.198]  I want to say great job to my crew here.
[01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:36.239]  They just do a better and better job.
[01:00:36.239 --> 01:00:36.880]  Exemplary.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.861]  We couldn't do it without them.
[01:00:37.861 --> 01:00:42.624]  And of course you, the listeners, AM and FM affiliates, sponsors, and all of our supporters.
[01:00:46.277 --> 01:00:54.501]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts quit doing his twice a week column and said he wanted to take some time off, but I knew a fighter for liberty, I knew he wasn't going away.
[01:00:54.501 --> 01:01:00.804]  So I called him up a few months ago and I said, look, you can take some time for yourself, you're not going anywhere.
[01:01:00.804 --> 01:01:04.006]  Somebody that loves liberty can't control themselves.
[01:01:04.006 --> 01:01:09.649]  And so it's good to have him, but he has cut back on what he's been doing, but it's great to have him with us and I was glad to get an email from him.
[01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:17.759]  Pointing out, hey, look at how there's all this evidence that our government, now been declassified knowingly, many times has left POWs behind.
[01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:20.903]  Not just in Vietnam, not just Korea, but World War II.
[01:01:20.903 --> 01:01:23.046]  What does this say about the mindset of the elite?
[01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:26.182]  And so he wanted to come on and talk about that.
[01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:27.902]  We're always honored to have him.
[01:01:27.902 --> 01:01:30.243]  But we'll cover about 20-30 minutes on that.
[01:01:30.243 --> 01:01:33.264]  Then I want to pick his brain because he is the father of economics.
[01:01:33.264 --> 01:01:37.805]  He is one of the top 10 living economists according to Forbes and other major publications.
[01:01:37.805 --> 01:01:41.006]  He's won some of the biggest honors from the French, US, British government.
[01:01:41.006 --> 01:01:43.607]  He is a best-selling author, former editor of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:43.607 --> 01:01:45.427]  So I want to get into North Korea.
[01:01:45.427 --> 01:01:46.187]  I ran with him.
[01:01:46.187 --> 01:01:47.308]  I want to get into the economy.
[01:01:47.308 --> 01:01:51.129]  I mean, they're openly talking about worldwide meltdown now all over the news.
[01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:55.572]  And of course you talked about this years ago via the derivatives and everything.
[01:01:55.572 --> 01:02:00.657]  So we're going to talk about it all with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts in the next hour.
[01:02:00.657 --> 01:02:03.119]  Doc, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.500]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.563]  You look good there via Skype video feed.
[01:02:07.563 --> 01:02:09.905]  Right, well thank you.
[01:02:09.905 --> 01:02:17.572]  So much is going on, so much is happening, but we're going to go to break in a few minutes, but get into this whole POW situation and your research on that.
[01:02:19.079 --> 01:02:21.961]  Well, you know, it's not my research.
[01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:30.427]  It's Sidney Schoenberg, the Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times reporter and editor.
[01:02:30.427 --> 01:02:41.735]  He has proven beyond all doubt and presents all the evidence that American prisoners of war were left behind in Vietnam.
[01:02:42.853 --> 01:02:44.555]  So that's the scandal.
[01:02:44.555 --> 01:02:53.705]  The second scandal is that every administration since Richard Nixon's has continued to cover up
[01:02:54.637 --> 01:03:08.028]  And the third scandal is that despite his high standing in journalism and all the prizes and the Pulitzer Prize and his high post at the New York Times, he was never allowed to write the story.
[01:03:08.028 --> 01:03:14.814]  And so it only came out in an out-of-the-way publication a year or two ago, about two years ago.
[01:03:15.014 --> 01:03:18.035]  Yeah, we actually interviewed the folks involved at the time.
[01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:19.496]  In fact, I think I even interviewed him.
[01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:21.456]  In fact, let's get him back on.
[01:03:21.456 --> 01:03:23.597]  Or some of the families involved.
[01:03:23.597 --> 01:03:30.179]  But the issue is, when I say your research, I'm saying, you know, you're writing about this now.
[01:03:30.179 --> 01:03:35.461]  Your research into how this ties in to the mindset of the ruling class.
[01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:35.701]  Yes.
[01:03:36.533 --> 01:03:59.193]  Yes, I think that now that we have definite proof from a very credible source, Sidney Schoenberg, that the United States government conducted a conspiracy since the 1970s to hide the fact that they abandoned American prisons of war to the North Vietnamese
[01:04:00.367 --> 01:04:02.128]  This is now proven.
[01:04:02.128 --> 01:04:18.717]  This might make Americans wonder if other so-called conspiracy theories are also true, such as the theory that 9-11 was an inside job or a false flag operation.
[01:04:18.717 --> 01:04:29.083]  It might make people wonder if the Warren Commission's account of Kennedy's assassination was just another cover-up.
[01:04:30.709 --> 01:04:33.530]  The same for Robert Kennedy's assassination.
[01:04:58.834 --> 01:05:05.496]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:05.496 --> 01:05:10.618]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:10.618 --> 01:05:25.744]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:05:27.848 --> 01:05:32.429]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:36.271]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:05:36.271 --> 01:05:37.491]  Others don't.
[01:05:37.491 --> 01:05:39.652]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:39.652 --> 01:05:41.432]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:05:41.432 --> 01:05:44.313]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:44.313 --> 01:05:50.955]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:50.955 --> 01:05:53.656]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:53.656 --> 01:05:56.017]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:05:56.017 --> 01:05:56.877]  Others don't.
[01:05:58.578 --> 01:06:02.480]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.741]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:03.741 --> 01:06:07.464]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.905]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:09.905 --> 01:06:15.769]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:06:15.769 --> 01:06:22.013]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:22.433 --> 01:06:28.395]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:28.395 --> 01:06:32.596]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:32.596 --> 01:06:36.877]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:36.877 --> 01:06:42.819]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:42.819 --> 01:06:46.380]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.361]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:48.361 --> 01:06:48.781]  It's here.

[01:06:58.789 --> 01:07:01.792]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:01.792 --> 01:07:07.137]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:07.137 --> 01:07:09.179]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:09.179 --> 01:07:14.183]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:14.183 --> 01:07:15.364]  How much do you want?
[01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:16.105]  When do you want it?
[01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.365]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:19.426]  When will you need it?
[01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:21.626]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:21.626 --> 01:07:22.967]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:22.967 --> 01:07:24.487]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:07:24.487 --> 01:07:29.768]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:07:29.768 --> 01:07:33.349]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:36.810]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:38.391]  How much will you need?
[01:07:38.391 --> 01:07:39.292]  We don't know.
[01:07:39.292 --> 01:07:40.393]  How much do you want?
[01:07:40.393 --> 01:07:41.334]  All you can get.
[01:07:41.334 --> 01:07:42.435]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:45.478]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:47.681]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:47.681 --> 01:07:48.682]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:07.076]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:07.076 --> 01:08:12.181]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.181 --> 01:08:23.152]  You call it synchronicity, serendipity, I don't know, but back on Monday and Tuesday, I talked quite a bit about the fact that it was actually declassified.
[01:08:24.588 --> 01:08:28.652]  That 20 plus thousand, 21 and a half thousand or so U.S.
[01:08:28.652 --> 01:08:35.860]  troops that were in Eastern European Nazi-held POW camps and German camps that were grabbed by Stalin.
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:36.481]  The U.S.
[01:08:36.481 --> 01:08:38.563]  and England wanted to be buddies with Stalin.
[01:08:38.563 --> 01:08:45.190]  They divided up Eastern Europe and he was a thug and kept them for intelligence purposes and they just let him keep them.
[01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:49.193]  And a few years ago, that actually even came out in Russian newspapers.
[01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:55.277]  You know, old Americans, World War II vets, 80-plus years old, still alive in Russia.
[01:08:55.277 --> 01:08:58.660]  And it's been confirmed with Korea, it's been confirmed with Vietnam.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.902]  We've had the families on, they've had congressional hearings that the media doesn't cover.
[01:09:02.902 --> 01:09:05.844]  They've had National Press Club meetings.
[01:09:05.844 --> 01:09:15.351]  But then when I got an email a few days ago from Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics, former head of Policy Department of Treasury under Reagan, former Wall Street Journal editor,
[01:09:16.837 --> 01:09:34.869]  Pointing out that he was going to write an article dealing with the fact that if it's a Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times editor for years isn't allowed to publish in a mainstream publication his research that's ironclad that this is all confirmed.
[01:09:34.869 --> 01:09:36.770]  I mean it's ridiculous how confirmed it is.
[01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:38.651]  It's like confirming that Mount St.
[01:09:38.651 --> 01:09:40.852]  Helens blew up in the early 1980s.
[01:09:40.852 --> 01:09:42.513]  It's a fact, it happened.
[01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:45.836]  Or that, you know, the first creature in space was a dog from Russia.
[01:09:45.836 --> 01:09:46.356]  It's a fact.
[01:09:48.004 --> 01:09:53.447]  And, you know, the angle... And, of course, Roberts wasn't listening to me.
[01:09:53.447 --> 01:10:02.231]  He separately put two and two together, because we're all having these same understandings that if they'll leave our troops to die, or if they'll... It's like Doug Rocky I've had on.
[01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:05.072]  He was the head of the DU program for more than a decade.
[01:10:05.072 --> 01:10:07.534]  He wrote the handbooks for the Pentagon in the 80s.
[01:10:07.534 --> 01:10:11.936]  They knew DU would kill anybody collectively that breathed it.
[01:10:13.986 --> 01:10:24.573]  And they just, in the mid-90s, changed the rules and said it's now good for you, no problem, and the State Department says it's a conspiracy theory on their website if you say it's bad.
[01:10:24.573 --> 01:10:31.158]  I mean, they absolutely know you breathe this, the particulate, the radiation, it's gonna kill you.
[01:10:31.158 --> 01:10:34.620]  I mean, it's gonna, you know, may take a few years, but you're dead.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.781]  Now they just say it's good for you.
[01:10:37.389 --> 01:10:50.381]  This shows you the mindset, and I liken it, and we're going to Dr. Roberts, but I want to make this point, to chess being invented 3,500 years ago in northern India and what's Iran today.
[01:10:50.381 --> 01:10:53.444]  They debate who invented it, but it came from that area.
[01:10:53.444 --> 01:10:58.388]  And in it, you have the gambit, the sacrifice of a pawn.
[01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:00.651]  That's a good move early on in basic chess.
[01:11:00.651 --> 01:11:02.572]  I'm not a good chess player, but I play some.
[01:11:03.846 --> 01:11:04.466]  Sacrificing
[01:11:28.272 --> 01:11:31.154]  That's why they say, so what, 21,000 U.S.
[01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:32.555]  troops, give them to Stalin.
[01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:34.576]  That's why they say, you know, hundreds and hundreds of U.S.
[01:11:34.576 --> 01:11:36.857]  troops, it was thousands, most of them dead.
[01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:43.441]  You know, let them be slaves, let them be tortured to death for 30 years in Vietnam.
[01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:45.162]  It's the gambit.
[01:11:45.162 --> 01:11:46.802]  And that's the beginning of evil.
[01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:50.505]  That's why special forces people, before they graduate, they are given
[01:11:51.505 --> 01:11:51.845]  I don't
[01:12:06.932 --> 01:12:13.156]  Army Manual declassified last year, well it was leaked by WikiLeaks from 2004, where it talks about staging false flag terror attacks.
[01:12:13.156 --> 01:12:15.797]  One of the favorites is to kill children, blame it on a foreign enemy.
[01:12:15.797 --> 01:12:25.243]  Captains and above in black ops are now taught this, and the argument is, well we're fighting commies or we're fighting Muslims, they're going to kill more children if we don't kill a few, you know, for the overall good.
[01:12:25.243 --> 01:12:31.607]  And that's kind of the straight razor, you know, statement in Apocalypse Now, where Colonel Kurtz is talking about what he's had to do to win.
[01:12:32.427 --> 01:12:37.050]  And so this is the mindset of you.
[01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:37.970]  Injustifies the means.
[01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:45.614]  Now I'm going to shut up and have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts go over this two-year-old information.
[01:12:45.614 --> 01:12:47.535]  The Nation Institute reported it.
[01:12:47.535 --> 01:12:50.276]  McCain and the POW cover-up.
[01:12:50.276 --> 01:12:57.160]  And this was written by a Pulitzer Prize winner, but completely a news blackout in the U.S.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.982]  Dr. Roberts, thanks for holding while I did that back story.
[01:12:59.982 --> 01:13:00.602]  You've got the floor.
[01:13:01.823 --> 01:13:04.524]  Well, let's first tell your listeners where they can read the account.
[01:13:04.524 --> 01:13:22.192]  It's now, it came out yesterday in the American Conservative, and so you'll have an account by the publisher of the magazine, you'll have an account by Schrandberg of why he was unable to tell the story, and then you have the story itself and the
[01:13:23.348 --> 01:13:24.089]  And the evidence.
[01:13:24.089 --> 01:13:25.630]  He presents all the evidence.
[01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:29.673]  And then they have a few people discussing the story.
[01:13:29.673 --> 01:13:36.197]  Now, it's also, I think, this morning, it was all put up on antiwar.com.
[01:13:36.197 --> 01:13:40.340]  And I'm sure you'll have it up on your site.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:46.685]  So that people can see that what was branded a conspiracy theory for several decades
[01:13:47.745 --> 01:13:57.369]  By the government, by the media, by all the mainstream, the establishment, they got rid of the POW issue by calling it a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:57.369 --> 01:14:02.271]  It's now been proven beyond all doubt that the conspiracy theory was true.
[01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:11.995]  The POWs were abandoned and there was a cover-up by the United States government that continues to this day.
[01:14:11.995 --> 01:14:12.696]  It's just like
[01:14:13.604 --> 01:14:17.565]  The cover-up of the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty.
[01:14:18.785 --> 01:14:27.171]  This was said to have been some kind of an accident, a mistaken identity of the ship, and that's been covered up ever since the 1960s.
[01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:34.877]  So we do have government cover-ups, a government that commits great acts of evil.
[01:14:34.877 --> 01:14:40.481]  I mean, what's more despicable than abandoning your own POWs?
[01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:43.163]  And they could have got the POWs back.
[01:14:43.163 --> 01:14:43.863]  All they had to do
[01:14:44.963 --> 01:14:46.944]  was to pay ransom.
[01:14:46.944 --> 01:14:59.248]  The North Koreans held back half of the prisoners, about 600 of them, in order to collect reparations for all the bombing the Americans had done to North Vietnam.
[01:14:59.248 --> 01:15:07.770]  And so they were willing to give the prisoners back if we would pay three or four billion dollars in ransom.
[01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.511]  And of course, by that time,
[01:15:10.864 --> 01:15:14.309]  Nixon was too weak to deliver the money.
[01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:16.293]  Watergate was consuming him.
[01:15:16.293 --> 01:15:18.376]  And once a lie gets in place...
[01:15:19.545 --> 01:15:21.707]  It can't be undone.
[01:15:21.707 --> 01:15:31.715]  It wasn't possible for the next president to say, hey look, we can get, they do have our prisoners and we can get them back for a little bit of money.
[01:15:31.715 --> 01:15:35.559]  So once a lie is in place, everyone ends up defending it.
[01:15:35.559 --> 01:15:42.825]  Even the Reagan administration ended up defending the claim that all the prisoners were back.
[01:15:42.825 --> 01:15:47.268]  So here we see a government that lies through its teeth
[01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:54.597]  about its prisoners that it abandoned and could have gotten back for very little money.
[01:15:54.597 --> 01:16:01.004]  So why do we believe the government tells us the truth about anything?
[01:16:01.004 --> 01:16:03.087]  And why do we think the media
[01:16:03.888 --> 01:16:13.133]  would possibly serve the people by delivering the truth when they prevented Schrandberg from ever publishing his account.
[01:16:13.133 --> 01:16:19.316]  I mean, he had to sit on this account for years and years until finally it got out in some out-of-the-way place.
[01:16:19.316 --> 01:16:29.061]  And now it's become news thanks to Ron Huntz, Huntz, the publisher of the American Conservative, who's making an issue out of it.
[01:16:29.061 --> 01:16:31.143]  And, of course, you've made an issue out of it.
[01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:43.176]  And so what I think might be hopeful about it is that it makes people see if the government will lie about this, they'll lie about 9-11.
[01:16:43.176 --> 01:16:46.118]  They'll lie about Kennedy's assassination.
[01:16:46.118 --> 01:16:48.099]  In fact, they lie about everything, don't they, Alex?
[01:16:48.099 --> 01:16:50.261]  They lie about the unemployment rate.
[01:16:50.261 --> 01:16:51.922]  They lie about the inflation rate.
[01:16:51.922 --> 01:16:53.683]  They lie about the bank bailout.
[01:16:53.683 --> 01:16:57.166]  What does the government not lie about?
[01:16:57.166 --> 01:16:58.187]  Well, here's another example.
[01:16:58.627 --> 01:17:02.829]  I mean, I had a congressman on more than ten years ago from Virginia who was upset.
[01:17:02.829 --> 01:17:06.850]  About six years ago, I had a member of the Australian Parliament on who was upset.
[01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:12.573]  It was in the Australian news, they were saying there's a secret UN database of all our kids' blood.
[01:17:12.573 --> 01:17:14.733]  The government's been taking the blood since 1971, 72.
[01:17:14.733 --> 01:17:16.994]  It was a worldwide program in Western countries.
[01:17:21.996 --> 01:17:28.639]  Uh, and they put it in a database and I would have these people on and read the documents and listeners wouldn't believe me.
[01:17:28.639 --> 01:17:30.139]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:17:30.139 --> 01:17:30.780]  Oh, guess what?
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:34.361]  The Pentagon's got your blood if you're 38 years old or younger.
[01:17:34.361 --> 01:17:36.402]  That's how criminal this group is.
[01:17:37.302 --> 01:17:51.885]  And how this national security state basically does whatever they want, then imagine that, Dr. Roberts, for 38 years, from Australia to Canada, from England to the US, they take our blood to put it in a government database, and now they announce, guess what?
[01:17:51.885 --> 01:17:54.725]  We're going to have a global DNA database and we already have your blood.
[01:17:54.725 --> 01:17:58.926]  I mean, it's just everything is a conspiracy, basically.
[01:17:58.926 --> 01:18:00.807]  It does look that way, doesn't it, Alex?
[01:18:00.807 --> 01:18:01.307]  It does!
[01:18:01.307 --> 01:18:02.347]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.743]  But see, the one advantage of this conspiracy now has been blown wide open.
[01:18:09.506 --> 01:18:17.551]  And therefore, it may help make people aware that the other conspiracies are true, too.
[01:18:17.551 --> 01:18:18.172]  Well, exactly.
[01:18:18.172 --> 01:18:22.314]  Expanding on that briefly, I mean, your point is well taken, and it's central.
[01:18:22.314 --> 01:18:36.924]  It's not just that they did this, it's the 30 years of cover-ups and not letting Pulitzer Prize winners ride on it, and now that story is as big as the POW story, that you have a giant group of people in media and government who would work together
[01:18:37.564 --> 01:18:39.105]  To leave a bunch of men to die?
[01:18:39.105 --> 01:18:42.367]  I mean, it's, it's, why?
[01:18:42.367 --> 01:18:43.547]  Right.
[01:18:43.547 --> 01:18:47.690]  And of course the same group, the same people are doing the same thing now.
[01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:55.234]  They're leading us deeper into wars, deeper into confrontation with nuclear armed powers.
[01:18:55.234 --> 01:18:57.235]  The evil is loose, as you said.
[01:18:57.235 --> 01:18:59.856]  Evil is loose in the United States.
[01:18:59.856 --> 01:19:02.878]  It's got an iron grip on the government.
[01:19:03.758 --> 01:19:08.061]  And probably on government at most levels in most places.
[01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:32.279]  So it is a very serious situation and it remains to be seen if the people wake up or enough of them wake up and if they do whether they have the capability of doing anything about it or whether they are just going to be pawns that are continued to be sacrificed so that a very small group of elites who control the government can achieve some agenda.
[01:19:32.979 --> 01:19:34.340]  Of their own.
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:39.704]  Well, sir, let's continue and talk about how big this story is and how important maybe go over some of the sections.
[01:19:39.704 --> 01:19:43.707]  AnnieWar.com's probably got 15 articles about it and documents.
[01:19:43.707 --> 01:19:46.609]  The Nation Institute has them.
[01:19:46.609 --> 01:19:51.012]  The conservative, the American conservative has it.
[01:19:51.012 --> 01:19:53.714]  We're getting it all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:19:53.714 --> 01:19:54.634]  Stay there, sir.
[01:19:54.634 --> 01:19:56.456]  I'm glad you contacted us about this.

[01:24:07.213 --> 01:24:09.697]  Alexander Cockburn, a former L.A.
[01:24:09.697 --> 01:24:17.429]  Times senior writer, he's got an article out today on anti-war saying sometimes conspiracy theories are true.
[01:24:18.632 --> 01:24:24.475]  Look, they just call it a conspiracy theory when you say that they're lying.
[01:24:24.475 --> 01:24:32.419]  I mean, it wasn't a conspiracy theory in 1964 when people started saying, our ships weren't attacked, that was staged, Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:24:32.419 --> 01:24:35.900]  It was in the San Diego newspaper.
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:40.623]  We've gone and gotten the microfilm that sailors came back and said, we weren't attacked, it's all a lie.
[01:24:41.403 --> 01:24:43.945]  It was in the newspaper, but then it becomes a rumor.
[01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:45.666]  Oh, I heard it was staged.
[01:24:45.666 --> 01:24:47.808]  Well, see, now it's declassified.
[01:24:47.808 --> 01:24:54.073]  After 40 plus years, on the anniversary of it, in 2004, 40 plus... I guess that's the...
[01:24:57.415 --> 01:24:59.557]  Yeah, 40 anniversary.
[01:24:59.557 --> 01:25:02.019]  They declassify that they staged it.
[01:25:02.019 --> 01:25:04.301]  Going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:25:04.301 --> 01:25:15.992]  As you said, though, the fact that you have such a huge cover-up shows that they've got a lot of willing people that will be part of this evil.
[01:25:15.992 --> 01:25:20.937]  Talk about that, Dr. Roberts, but also, why would they want to lie and not get our troops back?
[01:25:22.594 --> 01:25:25.676]  Okay, those are all good questions.
[01:25:25.676 --> 01:25:35.020]  First, let me say that one of the many important contributions Schoenberg makes is he shows how the government lies.
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:42.684]  He shows the technique, how they do it, how they get rid of conclusive evidence.
[01:25:42.684 --> 01:25:51.369]  And so that itself is very revealing and your listeners should read just to see how the government goes about burying
[01:25:51.929 --> 01:25:52.349]  The truth.
[01:25:52.349 --> 01:25:53.229]  We got plenty of time.
[01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:54.510]  Boil it down.
[01:25:54.510 --> 01:26:00.872]  Well, the specific examples are given by Schoenberg, and it's best for them to read.
[01:26:00.872 --> 01:26:16.436]  Now, to get to your questions, interestingly enough, there were two American defense secretaries, James Schlesinger, who was actually one of my graduate professors in economics, and Melvin Laird.
[01:26:17.534 --> 01:26:23.158]  Who both testified under oath to Congress that men were left behind.
[01:26:23.158 --> 01:26:38.790]  So even when two defense secretaries, and of course Melvin Laird was the Secretary of Defense during the Nixon period when the Vietnam War was wound down, so he certainly would know, and Schlesinger came not long after.
[01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:39.971]  So we have
[01:26:41.532 --> 01:26:42.193]  We're good to go.
[01:27:00.225 --> 01:27:08.132]  Because their notion is, it's my career, I'm serving my career, and I'm not gonna go against whatever the line is.
[01:27:08.132 --> 01:27:12.915]  And who cares if men are still rotting and being used as slaves, which has been confirmed.
[01:27:12.915 --> 01:27:20.141]  There's some still alive, being worked to death as slaves, and these fat, lazy, evil congressmen, just they're pigs.
[01:27:20.862 --> 01:27:21.543]  They're pigs.
[01:27:21.543 --> 01:27:23.265]  They're the scum of the earth.
[01:27:23.265 --> 01:27:26.530]  In fact, the United States government is the scum of the earth.
[01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:29.954]  The worst people in the country are in the government.
[01:27:30.831 --> 01:27:32.672]  They're not the criminals out there.
[01:27:32.672 --> 01:27:33.913]  They're not even the terrorists.
[01:27:33.913 --> 01:27:36.734]  The worst people are in the government.
[01:27:36.734 --> 01:27:42.978]  And that is another reason, I think, that Strandberg's story is so explosive.
[01:27:42.978 --> 01:27:47.620]  Because Americans don't want to come to grips with that.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:52.363]  It's too much of a demand on their emotional strength and their intellectual strength.
[01:27:52.363 --> 01:27:57.645]  And so it's something that people want to keep under the covers.
[01:27:58.954 --> 01:28:07.442]  I think the reason the lie got started was that, you know, the Washington Post was doing a job on Nixon with Watergate.
[01:28:07.442 --> 01:28:12.526]  He was trying to wind down the war while Watergate was devouring him.
[01:28:12.526 --> 01:28:15.248]  And so he just didn't have any clout.
[01:28:15.248 --> 01:28:18.711]  He couldn't deliver the money to get the prisoners back.
[01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:21.093]  And so he had to say, we had them all back.
[01:28:21.093 --> 01:28:22.915]  The war's over and we have everybody back.
[01:28:22.915 --> 01:28:23.696]  He couldn't say,
[01:28:24.156 --> 01:28:36.762]  Hey, the war's over and we've left all these people because he would be blamed, not the Washington Post, not those two reporters, Bernstein and Woodward, not the Congress.
[01:28:36.762 --> 01:28:40.763]  He would be blamed and he was already in terrible hot water about Watergate.
[01:28:40.763 --> 01:28:44.845]  So he said, we have everybody back.
[01:28:44.845 --> 01:28:46.266]  Well, once the lies in place,
[01:28:46.966 --> 01:28:47.967]  How do you get
[01:29:03.263 --> 01:29:24.407]  9-11 Commission report which proves that the whole thing was totally different than you just hit on the key there I just had another epiphany that's right they they have a mass hoax they tell you what the story is that everyone commits and the average American says I'm not gonna believe I'm being lied to because if this is a lie everything's a lie and once they've got you in you know it
[01:29:24.887 --> 01:29:30.090]  I guess by degrees, you become part of the evil, and now we're just a huge culture of lies.
[01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:31.731]  Dr. Roberts, long segment coming up.
[01:29:31.731 --> 01:29:33.111]  This was a short segment.
[01:29:33.111 --> 01:29:36.513]  Continue breaking down this central point that you just made.
[01:29:36.513 --> 01:29:40.295]  I mean, it's like getting your arm caught in a sausage machine.
[01:29:40.295 --> 01:29:46.458]  It's just sucking us all in, and now we have to, you know, go along with every lie, because our government isn't bad.
[01:29:46.458 --> 01:29:49.119]  They're good, and that allows the evil to grow.
[01:29:49.119 --> 01:29:50.520]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.021]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:31:00.625 --> 01:31:02.967]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:31:02.967 --> 01:31:06.170]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:11.275]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:31:11.275 --> 01:31:15.799]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:31:15.799 --> 01:31:18.141]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:31:18.141 --> 01:31:20.683]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:31:20.683 --> 01:31:23.546]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:31:23.926 --> 01:31:31.547]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:31:31.863 --> 01:31:37.247]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:31:37.247 --> 01:31:40.108]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:31:40.108 --> 01:31:43.791]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:31:43.791 --> 01:31:44.851]  And I got news for you.
[01:31:44.851 --> 01:31:46.212]  You're everyone else.

[01:32:50.317 --> 01:32:50.837]  Thank you!
[01:33:04.218 --> 01:33:17.182]  Okay, we're going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and while we're on the subject of almost everything the government and the big corporations that control it says is a lie, until we're just swimming in an ether of lies.
[01:33:17.182 --> 01:33:24.725]  And then anyone who discovers we're being lied to, from the source documents, from the witnesses, is called a conspiracy theorist.
[01:33:25.802 --> 01:33:37.629]  I want to bring up the fact that the Washington Post three days ago just came out in a headline about Saddam and a fake movie saying he was gay by the CIA, that they did make a video, a fake Bin Laden video.
[01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:38.870]  What an incredible admission.
[01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:45.034]  Or now they're suddenly everywhere admitting, okay, the troops helped grow the opium, because if we don't grow it, Al-Qaeda will get it.
[01:33:45.034 --> 01:33:49.196]  So now they're just spinning everything but admitting everything.
[01:33:49.196 --> 01:33:51.138]  So we'll talk to them about that, the economy.
[01:33:52.068 --> 01:34:10.696]  And a lot more, but I'm really glad he's out there promoting the fact that, you know, this huge cover-up of the Pulitzer Prize winning, you know, report by a New York Times editor with all of the absolute proof, you gotta go read the reports, of the fact that they... I mean, this is total proof.
[01:34:10.696 --> 01:34:17.539]  The government knowingly blocked it, knowingly shut it down, knowingly kept the public from knowing.
[01:34:17.879 --> 01:34:22.881]  I mean, this is confirmed, just like Gulf of Tonkin or so many other things, Operation Ajax, you name it.
[01:34:22.881 --> 01:34:28.284]  Before we go back to Dr. Roberts, here's a book, The Secret Team.
[01:34:28.284 --> 01:34:32.246]  This is the book the CIA doesn't want you to read by L. Fletcher Prouty, Colonel, U.S.
[01:34:32.246 --> 01:34:32.826]  Army.
[01:34:32.826 --> 01:34:38.809]  He was the admitted Pentagon liaison to the CIA and the White House briefer.
[01:34:38.809 --> 01:34:42.110]  We got a White House briefer, very important position.
[01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:43.391]  Ray McGovern joining us next hour.
[01:34:43.931 --> 01:34:51.417]  The Secret Team, this is now back in print from Skyhorse Publishing, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:51.417 --> 01:34:53.599]  Or Invisible Empire, a new order to find.
[01:34:53.599 --> 01:34:58.723]  Who these people are, how these criminal networks operate, how to stop them, very important new film.
[01:34:58.723 --> 01:35:04.308]  Police State for the Rise of FEMA, the physical enforcement grid being put in because they know you're waking up.
[01:35:04.308 --> 01:35:06.630]  Very important info, every American needs to see this.
[01:35:07.170 --> 01:35:08.151]  Don't tread on me.
[01:35:08.151 --> 01:35:08.912]  State's rights.
[01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:10.474]  Ninth Amendment rights.
[01:35:10.474 --> 01:35:12.677]  One key avenue to take the country back.
[01:35:12.677 --> 01:35:14.179]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:14.179 --> 01:35:15.721]  And of course, the Obama deception.
[01:35:15.721 --> 01:35:17.083]  Follow the Republic.
[01:35:17.083 --> 01:35:20.287]  All of those available at InfoWars.com.

[01:35:26.254 --> 01:35:30.276]  Okay, speaking of material, you may be fully awake, audience.
[01:35:30.276 --> 01:35:32.137]  Your friends, your family, your neighbors aren't.
[01:35:32.137 --> 01:35:33.138]  They know we're in trouble.
[01:35:33.138 --> 01:35:35.999]  Now the time is ripe to educate people.
[01:35:35.999 --> 01:35:42.083]  Before we get back into this story, Dr. Roberts, tell folks about your new book, because that is extremely informative.
[01:35:43.254 --> 01:35:45.135]  Well, that's how the economy was lost.
[01:35:45.135 --> 01:35:59.786]  That book explains how the elite destroyed the middle class jobs in order to further enrich themselves and how they have dismantled the ladders of upward mobility
[01:36:01.366 --> 01:36:16.650]  Stopping the ability of people to rise in order to put themselves in permanent control at the top and the other 99% of the population in poverty at the bottom.
[01:36:16.650 --> 01:36:18.951]  That's what the book shows.
[01:36:20.311 --> 01:36:29.079]  It shows how the end of the American middle class and the end of an opportunity society.
[01:36:29.079 --> 01:36:45.895]  Now, Alex, let's get back to the story because, you know, one of the things that people always say when they're confronted with evidence that the government has lied or something, they would say, well, if there had been a real conspiracy, somebody would have talked.
[01:36:47.551 --> 01:36:50.234]  But of course, they always do talk.
[01:36:50.234 --> 01:36:59.484]  As I said earlier, two United States Secretaries of Defense talked and said in sworn testimony that people were left behind.
[01:36:59.484 --> 01:37:02.667]  Reagan's National Security Advisor talked.
[01:37:04.508 --> 01:37:14.670]  A leader of a Delta team, which twice was organized to go rescue the prisoners, only to be called off both times, has talked.
[01:37:14.670 --> 01:37:16.411]  All sorts of people have talked.
[01:37:16.411 --> 01:37:18.991]  So it doesn't do any good to talk.
[01:37:18.991 --> 01:37:28.013]  In the case of 9-11, we know, and have said so many times, there were over a hundred first responders who were in the towers.
[01:37:28.013 --> 01:37:31.234]  Firemen, policemen, building maintenance people.
[01:37:31.914 --> 01:37:45.669]  Well, Doc, as you say, I've interviewed police and firemen who we saw on the CNN video saying they're gonna blow it up, get it back.
[01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:48.432]  They weren't involved, they were just told get back.
[01:37:48.432 --> 01:37:52.317]  And Silverstein says we gave the order to pull it and watch it come down, and now a Fox News pundit
[01:37:52.657 --> 01:37:56.019]  Well, the point is, it doesn't do any good if somebody talks, because it remains a conspiracy.
[01:38:14.269 --> 01:38:14.990]  Very.
[01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:31.268]  Now, as for the cover-up, you know, obviously the Pentagon and the military are very interested in the cover-up because how many people would join up the military if they expected to have to fight if they knew the government would abandon them if they were captured?
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:39.885]  I mean, what kind of morale would the Army have, and the Marines, for example, and the Special Forces?
[01:38:39.885 --> 01:38:48.031]  Would they be all these gung-ho people out there if they were aware of the fact that if they get captured, they may simply be abandoned?
[01:38:48.931 --> 01:38:54.893]  And that when the war's over, they won't be repatriated, they'll just be left in the enemy's hands.
[01:38:54.893 --> 01:38:58.454]  So this is the reason for the cover-up, you see.
[01:38:58.454 --> 01:39:03.315]  There are many reasons affecting all parties.
[01:39:03.315 --> 01:39:13.338]  And what is also amazing is that the two chief celebrities who were prisoners of war, John McCain and John Kerry,
[01:39:15.096 --> 01:39:21.819]  Well, Kerry wasn't a prisoner of war, but he was controversial about Vietnam getting the Silver Star.
[01:39:21.819 --> 01:39:25.520]  So we have these two, and they're both instrumental in the cover-up.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:33.464]  Both of them have done everything possible to prevent the truth from coming out.
[01:39:33.464 --> 01:39:38.906]  And not only that, but to lock up all the documents that reveal the truth.
[01:39:40.569 --> 01:39:49.892]  So, and McCain, of course, is notorious for browbeating all the witnesses, including the POW families.
[01:39:49.892 --> 01:40:02.036]  And Kerry went along with changes in the law that simply put, locked away somewhere forever, all the documents that prove the prisoners were abandoned.
[01:40:03.836 --> 01:40:07.318]  You can see the extent of the corruption and the evil.
[01:40:07.318 --> 01:40:09.599]  It's John McCain on the right.
[01:40:09.599 --> 01:40:12.001]  It's John Kerry on the left.
[01:40:12.001 --> 01:40:13.161]  It's the Republicans.
[01:40:13.161 --> 01:40:14.802]  It's the Democrats.
[01:40:14.802 --> 01:40:25.968]  It's all the presidential appointees, with the exception of those two secretaries of defense and Reagan's National Security Advisor.
[01:40:25.968 --> 01:40:28.770]  Doc, is somebody approaching with a vacuum cleaner?
[01:40:29.676 --> 01:40:30.696]  No.
[01:40:30.696 --> 01:40:35.398]  Okay, because there's a little bit of a hum in the background and it's just increased a little bit.
[01:40:35.398 --> 01:40:39.639]  I don't want it to... some of it was drowning you out, but that's important info you're covering.
[01:40:39.639 --> 01:40:41.740]  So we see the method of the control.
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:48.162]  In fact, from some of the documents I've seen in research, this is a system of corruption.
[01:40:48.162 --> 01:40:57.865]  They like to get the entire government, different power structures, involved in a huge cover-up, because then later it can also be used to blackmail.
[01:40:58.385 --> 01:41:12.766]  And that's what special forces commanders and many others that we've talked to who've worked on this have said is that the North Vietnamese are blackmailing the federal government to this day because the federal government made that
[01:41:13.767 --> 01:41:14.587]  Exactly.
[01:41:14.587 --> 01:41:15.247]  That's right.
[01:41:40.442 --> 01:41:45.544]  And anybody in the American government that talks is simply out of the government.
[01:41:45.544 --> 01:41:49.125]  They go from being a high official to a nobody.
[01:41:49.125 --> 01:41:52.386]  So this is how the government gets away with its lies.
[01:41:52.386 --> 01:41:57.368]  And of course the American people, or so many of them, are just gullible.
[01:41:57.368 --> 01:42:00.469]  They're just terribly gullible.
[01:42:00.469 --> 01:42:05.891]  And they have this sort of faith and trust in government that Americans didn't used to have.
[01:42:05.891 --> 01:42:07.752]  I blame that on Franklin Roosevelt.
[01:42:08.732 --> 01:42:19.859]  Who in the Great Depression, trying to rally people, gave them the idea, which they've had ever since, that the government is their protector.
[01:42:19.859 --> 01:42:21.580]  And it's going to put a chicken in every pot.
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:25.222]  Yeah, and keep them safe, you see.
[01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:28.745]  And as we've talked about many times on your program,
[01:42:29.628 --> 01:42:39.213]  This was a line of the Bush-Cheney regime that, oh, we're going to take away all your civil liberties and destroy the Constitution in order to make you safe.
[01:42:39.213 --> 01:42:39.733]  Terrorists!
[01:42:41.005 --> 01:42:41.105]  And
[01:43:02.226 --> 01:43:03.547]  It never enters their head.
[01:43:03.547 --> 01:43:13.053]  It's always, oh, some tiny group of Muslims who can't even fly airplanes.
[01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:17.235]  They didn't.
[01:43:17.235 --> 01:43:25.881]  But, you know, perhaps, to repeat myself, the fact that this story is now getting out and getting some attention about the POWs,
[01:43:27.332 --> 01:43:30.915]  Because that really touches at the heart of American patriotism, doesn't it?
[01:43:30.915 --> 01:43:37.780]  I mean, that really touches the flag wavers, the people who want to kill them over there before they come over here.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:49.889]  It really cuts to the very heart of the most conservative people, the people who are most willing to go to war to achieve whatever the government says.
[01:43:49.889 --> 01:43:53.872]  If it turns out that the government has actually abandoned its own soldiers,
[01:43:54.994 --> 01:43:58.216]  Then it could possibly shake some of those people.
[01:43:58.216 --> 01:44:11.646]  It could possibly cause more skepticism among the public and it could lead to the unraveling of other massive lies and conspiracies.
[01:44:11.646 --> 01:44:19.332]  Well Dr. Paul Roberts, let me expand on that because from my research, and I mean it's on record this happened,
[01:44:19.952 --> 01:44:27.634]  There was over 20,000 US troops in German POW camps that were grabbed by the Russians.
[01:44:27.634 --> 01:44:38.898]  And by then, Roosevelt had died, and Harry Truman said, Stalin's our ally, and basically we're not going to get in a fight with him.
[01:44:38.898 --> 01:44:42.319]  They gave him half of Eastern Europe, they gave him half of Germany.
[01:44:42.319 --> 01:44:44.480]  That's the thing that made
[01:44:46.073 --> 01:44:47.974]  And now documents have come out on this.
[01:44:47.974 --> 01:44:53.136]  That's what caused Patton to have a complete conniption fit.
[01:44:53.136 --> 01:44:56.418]  And so they killed him.
[01:44:56.418 --> 01:45:04.522]  And so this has been a policy for a while that troops are just expendable animals, as Henry Kissinger said.
[01:45:04.522 --> 01:45:08.023]  And so this goes back even to the greatest generation.
[01:45:08.023 --> 01:45:13.446]  And I would challenge all these Pulitzer Prize winning people to go look into that because that's hidden in plain view as well.
[01:45:15.097 --> 01:45:17.360]  Yes, I think you're right.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:26.293]  The people, you know, Frederick Boniak in his book, The Road to Serfdom, he has a chapter, Why the Worst Always Get on Top.
[01:45:27.415 --> 01:45:33.398]  And that goes not just for totalitarian systems, but for democracies.
[01:45:33.398 --> 01:45:36.259]  The worst rise to the top.
[01:45:36.259 --> 01:45:40.421]  And we certainly have the worst people in the country in Washington.
[01:45:40.421 --> 01:45:42.842]  That's where the worst people are.
[01:45:42.842 --> 01:45:47.464]  And these kinds of people don't have compunction.
[01:45:47.464 --> 01:45:50.505]  They don't have shame.
[01:45:50.505 --> 01:45:51.766]  They're not moral.
[01:45:52.785 --> 01:45:57.295]  They have ruthless agendas that feature themselves.
[01:45:58.337 --> 01:46:06.101]  And that is why democracy itself is no protection from a ruthless government.
[01:46:06.101 --> 01:46:09.703]  Well, that's why you've got to have the republic where the minority as well as the majority is protected.
[01:46:09.703 --> 01:46:11.584]  And I've done a general research of history.
[01:46:11.584 --> 01:46:17.046]  I don't claim to be a historian, but I read history books almost every day as my entertainment.
[01:46:17.046 --> 01:46:26.451]  That's how I actually got informed as an adolescent and a teenager was because I happened to pick up history as a form of entertainment, not knowing I was educating myself on the way the world works.
[01:46:27.171 --> 01:46:27.452]  I don't
[01:46:46.355 --> 01:46:47.396]  Yes, it is very frustrating.
[01:46:47.396 --> 01:46:50.199]  But if we can just keep making people aware that every American government since Nixon
[01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.831]  That's right.
[01:47:31.617 --> 01:47:48.222]  This should help bring the sort of most gullible flag-waving patrons to some realization that the government isn't trustworthy and it doesn't look after anyone's interest, not even the soldiers that are out there
[01:47:49.682 --> 01:47:51.443]  Giving up their lives and limbs.
[01:47:51.443 --> 01:47:52.463]  Well, what about this issue?
[01:47:52.463 --> 01:47:58.886]  They ask the troops to torture, they ask them to execute people in Afghanistan illegally, which then corrupts them.
[01:47:58.886 --> 01:48:08.310]  And then every time it comes out, like Abu Ghraib in Iraq, they then prosecute the people who on record were following the White House memos and orders.
[01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:17.114]  So it's not just that you'll be left behind, it's that you'll be used up and then scapegoated later because there's no honor among these thieves that run the system.
[01:48:17.734 --> 01:48:18.755]  That's exactly right.
[01:48:18.755 --> 01:48:25.500]  I don't know why anyone who was aware would have anything to do with the military.
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:28.123]  I don't know why anyone would join.
[01:48:28.123 --> 01:48:38.371]  I can't understand why the students at West Point and Annapolis and the Air Force Academy just don't get up en masse and walk out.
[01:48:38.371 --> 01:48:40.673]  Because they're going to be betrayed too.
[01:48:42.279 --> 01:48:47.601]  Or they're going to be used for evil and then betrayed.
[01:48:47.601 --> 01:48:54.742]  And even if you don't want to be, you're forced to go along with it or your career is destroyed.
[01:48:54.742 --> 01:48:55.583]  But that's my point.
[01:48:55.583 --> 01:48:58.824]  There's a systematic evil throughout history.
[01:48:58.824 --> 01:49:01.744]  We see Hitler killing his brown shirts that brought him to power.
[01:49:01.744 --> 01:49:04.545]  We see things that happen in every society.
[01:49:04.545 --> 01:49:06.146]  It's like a tropism.
[01:49:06.146 --> 01:49:10.567]  It's a pathology in corrupt elites that they
[01:49:11.227 --> 01:49:16.668]  Their greatest glee is hanging their own attack dogs out to dry.
[01:49:16.668 --> 01:49:26.370]  Because if I was one of these evil people, but I guess I'm not evil so I can't understand it, I would at least defend my henchmen and my servants to have that servant group, my praetorian.
[01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:31.191]  But no, they treat their praetorian like toilet paper.
[01:49:31.191 --> 01:49:32.291]  That's right.
[01:49:32.291 --> 01:49:35.912]  Because they learned from the Romans that the praetorian can take over the ruler.
[01:49:37.182 --> 01:49:55.693]  So Stalin ends up killing his own heads of his secret police and his own colleagues in the Politburo because they know that no one has any integrity or morality and that they're all a fair game for one another.
[01:49:55.693 --> 01:50:00.856]  So whoever strikes first and gets rid of the others is the survivor.
[01:50:00.856 --> 01:50:03.758]  And that's how the system ends up eating itself.
[01:50:06.324 --> 01:50:10.967]  But of course, we don't really care if the evil people eat each other up.
[01:50:10.967 --> 01:50:17.732]  What we're worried about is how they're destroying the rest of us who are not among their ranks.
[01:50:17.732 --> 01:50:25.798]  And this is the fact that the American people need to wake up to and that you keep telling them about every day.
[01:50:26.257 --> 01:50:27.317]  Well, that's another issue.
[01:50:27.317 --> 01:50:39.063]  I mean, I've seen your transformation and research the last five, six years we've been talking to you, from saying they're just a bunch of nuts, a bunch of crooks, they don't know what they're doing, to saying, no, this is clearly by design, because all the evidence shows it is.
[01:50:39.063 --> 01:50:43.525]  I want to briefly talk about the economy with you and all these headlines.
[01:50:43.525 --> 01:50:47.346]  Is Europe heading for a meltdown?
[01:50:47.346 --> 01:50:49.968]  Just on and on and on, what's happening worldwide.
[01:50:50.808 --> 01:50:59.234]  Where this agenda is going and also about them just openly announcing that they make fake Bin Laden videos.
[01:50:59.234 --> 01:51:03.136]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:03.136 --> 01:51:06.919]  My name is Spann and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:51:07.321 --> 01:51:12.065]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:14.147]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:51:14.147 --> 01:51:15.869]  Made me feel breathless.
[01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:20.312]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:51:20.312 --> 01:51:21.393]  Nothing did anything.
[01:51:21.393 --> 01:51:25.537]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:51:25.537 --> 01:51:29.500]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:32.143]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:51:32.583 --> 01:51:37.584]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.

[01:51:58.871 --> 01:52:00.172]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:00.172 --> 01:52:05.755]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:05.755 --> 01:52:10.777]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:10.777 --> 01:52:16.360]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.043]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:21.584 --> 01:52:28.686]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:28.686 --> 01:52:29.806]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:29.806 --> 01:52:36.488]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:43.030]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:51.596 --> 01:52:52.116]  We're good to go.
[01:53:19.206 --> 01:53:21.872]  At airfiltersandpurifiers.com.
[01:53:21.872 --> 01:53:26.664]  Our air purifiers are specialized to fit your needs from allergy sufferers to the sleep deprived.
[01:53:35.894 --> 01:53:36.154]  I think so.
[01:54:02.366 --> 01:54:16.332]  All right, with us until five after, the first little segment of the next hour is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, then high-level CIA analyst, the man who briefed Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush every morning, key quote CIA White House focal officer.
[01:54:17.912 --> 01:54:21.754]  That's what Fletcher Prouty did between the Pentagon and the CIA.
[01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:25.776]  Key person on what's happening in North Korea and Iran.
[01:54:25.776 --> 01:54:29.178]  Joining us for the last 52 minutes of the next hour.
[01:54:29.178 --> 01:54:34.321]  Doc, for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, I'm gonna give them a document cam shot of this.
[01:54:34.321 --> 01:54:41.005]  For radio listeners, the headline is, CIA Unit's Wacky Idea Depicts Saddam Hussein as Gay.
[01:54:41.005 --> 01:54:44.047]  And it's spy talk, Jeff Stein, you know, a little propagandist.
[01:54:44.047 --> 01:54:45.768]  But in the seventh paragraph,
[01:54:46.368 --> 01:54:49.591]  They just let it slip out.
[01:54:49.591 --> 01:55:00.563]  The agency actually did make a video purporting to show Osama Bin Laden and his cronies sitting around a campfire swigging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquest with boys.
[01:55:00.563 --> 01:55:04.627]  One of the former CIA officers recalled chuckling at the memory.
[01:55:04.627 --> 01:55:07.751]  The actors were drawn from some of the darker-skinned employees, he said.
[01:55:09.232 --> 01:55:15.616]  Now, I asked Dr. Roberts during the break, because I knew the answer, but I wanted to get his take, just to see if he concurred.
[01:55:15.616 --> 01:55:16.657]  Why are they doing this, Doc?
[01:55:16.657 --> 01:55:21.480]  Why are they admitting they're growing opium in Afghanistan and have our troops on TV saying they do it?
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:28.824]  Why are they admitting, saying that they killed the same Al-Qaeda leader 14, 15 times, never retract the last time they killed him?
[01:55:28.824 --> 01:55:31.826]  Why are they now just admitting the bin Laden tapes are fake?
[01:55:31.826 --> 01:55:35.368]  And he gave the answer that I agree with.
[01:55:35.368 --> 01:55:36.489]  Dr. Roberts, tell folks why.
[01:55:37.674 --> 01:55:57.022]  Well, I think, Alex, what they're doing, they're showing us that they have immunity, that they can do whatever they want, they can do it openly, and they can lie to us openly, and they can tell us that they commit crimes, and yet they don't suffer any consequences.
[01:55:57.022 --> 01:56:04.125]  I think they're getting us accustomed and used to the fact that they can do whatever they want and even admit it!
[01:56:05.442 --> 01:56:16.728]  And that we just have to sort of not notice and accept the fact that they are unaccountable and can do whatever they want.
[01:56:16.728 --> 01:56:26.533]  So I, you know, it just makes you accept the culture of lies and it makes the people realize that they're powerless.
[01:56:26.533 --> 01:56:34.597]  Here's a government that lies to us and then admits it lies to us and then goes on and lies to us some more and then admits it some more.
[01:56:35.487 --> 01:56:39.608]  And it's just kind of a way of showing the people that they don't count.
[01:56:39.608 --> 01:56:40.829]  I'll expand on that, though.
[01:56:40.829 --> 01:56:45.510]  There was a city employee, John Villarreal, who went to Huntsville for three years.
[01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:51.452]  And I confirmed this city employee was stealing money and trying to shut down AXS TV four years ago, five years ago now.
[01:56:51.452 --> 01:56:56.334]  So I secretly recorded him, put private investigators on him, because that's where I started out.
[01:56:56.334 --> 01:56:59.394]  I wasn't doing a show there anymore, but I wanted to keep it alive.
[01:56:59.394 --> 01:57:00.135]  And he came to me
[01:57:01.175 --> 01:57:02.456]  I didn't have a camera rolling.
[01:57:02.456 --> 01:57:06.300]  I was coming out of the bathroom at the telecommunications commission downtown.
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:12.646]  He was waiting for me in the hall and I had my camera guy inside for the commission and he walked over and he shoved me in the chest.
[01:57:13.638 --> 01:57:18.319]  And he said, you bet I stole the money and I'm gonna kill you and you're never gonna stop me.
[01:57:18.319 --> 01:57:19.839]  And I said, that's a threat.
[01:57:19.839 --> 01:57:21.499]  I'm gonna send your ass to prison.
[01:57:21.499 --> 01:57:23.040]  Excuse my French, folks.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.580]  And I did send him to prison.
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:29.221]  So it's also kind of a bravado they do, like, yeah, we made the fake tapes.
[01:57:29.221 --> 01:57:31.221]  Yeah, we did it all.
[01:57:31.221 --> 01:57:32.741]  So what?
[01:57:32.741 --> 01:57:40.923]  So I don't think they're invincible and there is a wake-up call happening, but I'm afraid they're gonna start wars, Dr. Roberts, as the smokescreen for what they're doing.
[01:57:42.128 --> 01:57:45.591]  Well, I'm certainly going to start more wars, there's no doubt about that.
[01:57:45.591 --> 01:57:52.738]  Let's just hope they don't get a nuclear war going with Russia.
[01:57:52.738 --> 01:57:58.643]  Well, we know Cheney now, it's come out, really did want to start a war with them and his whole 888 thing.
[01:57:58.643 --> 01:58:02.627]  Well, that's been the whole neocon line for years.
[01:58:02.627 --> 01:58:06.351]  They've wanted a nuclear war with Russia.
[01:58:06.351 --> 01:58:07.652]  It's part of the bravado, yeah.
[01:58:09.206 --> 01:58:10.906]  Well, let's talk briefly about the economy.
[01:58:10.906 --> 01:58:11.646]  Yeah, let's do that.
[01:58:11.646 --> 01:58:13.847]  One minute break, we're going to come back in five minutes with you.
[01:58:13.847 --> 01:58:15.307]  But, you know, we're here laughing about it.
[01:58:15.307 --> 01:58:16.987]  It's gallows humor.
[01:58:16.987 --> 01:58:20.208]  Because they just, it's tough.
[01:58:20.208 --> 01:58:21.548]  You know, we want nuclear war.
[01:58:21.548 --> 01:58:23.068]  It's fun.
[01:58:23.068 --> 01:58:26.129]  Because they've got all the women, all the whores, all the money.
[01:58:26.129 --> 01:58:30.030]  These guys are like Hitler, who would sit there watching Warsaw burn.
[01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:35.150]  You know, he would get up on the front line and watch from five miles away just because he liked watching buildings burn.
[01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:37.631]  He liked watching Stukas drop bombs.
[01:58:41.198 --> 01:58:43.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:46.003]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.567 --> 01:58:53.510]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:54.531]  What have we got?
[01:58:54.531 --> 01:58:56.972]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:58:56.972 --> 01:58:57.973]  A republic.
[01:58:57.973 --> 01:59:00.635]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:59:00.635 --> 01:59:02.896]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:59:02.896 --> 01:59:04.917]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:59:04.917 --> 01:59:06.598]  So they think they own our land?
[01:59:06.598 --> 01:59:07.919]  They think they own our water?
[01:59:07.919 --> 01:59:08.519]  Children?
[01:59:08.519 --> 01:59:09.640]  Our education?
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:10.481]  Our money?
[01:59:10.481 --> 01:59:14.123]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:59:14.483 --> 01:59:18.169]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:59:18.169 --> 01:59:19.471]  You have been warned.
[01:59:19.471 --> 01:59:20.493]  We have the facts.
[01:59:20.493 --> 01:59:21.654]  We have the Constitution.
[01:59:21.654 --> 01:59:22.556]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:59:22.556 --> 01:59:23.457]  We have common law.
[01:59:23.457 --> 01:59:25.961]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:25.961 --> 01:59:29.747]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:59:29.847 --> 01:59:34.790]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:36.291]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:59:36.291 --> 01:59:37.391]  Don't tread on me.
[01:59:37.391 --> 01:59:51.640]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.021]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.021 --> 01:59:56.282]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio.
[02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:03.977]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[02:00:04.754 --> 02:00:06.515]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:06.515 --> 02:00:08.096]  You want answers?
[02:00:08.096 --> 02:00:09.657]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.657 --> 02:00:13.859]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.859 --> 02:00:18.321]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.321 --> 02:00:24.965]  Okay, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest, best-selling author, syndicated columnist, father of ergonomics.
[02:00:24.965 --> 02:00:26.946]  We've got about four and a half minutes.
[02:00:26.946 --> 02:00:33.550]  The economy, the meltdown accelerating, the Goldman Sachs emails with a new
[02:00:34.796 --> 02:00:36.680]  That the economy was going to implode.
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:38.464]  They set up the derivative scam.
[02:00:38.464 --> 02:00:39.827]  We have them red-handed.
[02:00:39.827 --> 02:00:41.571]  Sir, where is this going?
[02:00:43.422 --> 02:00:50.048]  Well, Alex, I think what we have is another criminal elite in charge of the financial sector.
[02:00:50.048 --> 02:00:56.314]  They're in charge of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and, of course, the New York Investment Banks and the hedge funds.
[02:00:56.314 --> 02:00:58.355]  Now, think about this for a minute.
[02:00:58.355 --> 02:01:02.079]  Allegedly, the euro is collapsing because of the Greek debt.
[02:01:02.079 --> 02:01:03.900]  Now, that makes no sense whatsoever.
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:05.342]  Greece is a small country.
[02:01:06.498 --> 02:01:11.343]  It's debts could not possibly be a threat to the euro.
[02:01:11.343 --> 02:01:14.146]  But we hear about this constantly, over and over and over and over.
[02:01:14.146 --> 02:01:17.289]  So it's propaganda coming out of the hedge funds.
[02:01:17.289 --> 02:01:19.051]  They're making a killing on it.
[02:01:19.051 --> 02:01:25.717]  If you can make the world think the euro is going to collapse, you can make all kind of money shorting the euro.
[02:01:25.717 --> 02:01:30.281]  And it's the same crowd of crooks that sold the derivatives.
[02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:37.975]  And that sold junk with AAA investment ratings on it.
[02:01:37.975 --> 02:01:39.396]  And so that's what they're now doing.
[02:01:39.396 --> 02:01:45.460]  This whole thing about the euro is a scam run by the hedge funds.
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.201]  And they're getting rich off of it.
[02:01:47.201 --> 02:01:51.184]  Look, the most indebted country in the world is Japan.
[02:01:51.184 --> 02:01:54.006]  And the second most indebted country is the United States.
[02:01:55.478 --> 02:02:01.759]  They're far worse conditions than Europe.
[02:02:01.759 --> 02:02:05.540]  And yet, it's Europe that's in the news.
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:08.240]  And the euro is collapsing against the dollar.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:10.381]  Why should anything collapse against the dollar?
[02:02:10.381 --> 02:02:16.041]  The dollar has massive trade deficit, massive budget deficits.
[02:02:16.041 --> 02:02:18.342]  They're unclosable.
[02:02:18.342 --> 02:02:22.243]  The government is indebted up to over its head.
[02:02:22.243 --> 02:02:24.483]  The population is indebted.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:29.022]  It's a far worse situation than in Europe, and yet it's the euro.
[02:02:29.022 --> 02:02:35.285]  So what it really is, it's a play of the New York Investment Banks and the hedge funds against the euro.
[02:02:35.285 --> 02:02:40.788]  And they're getting rich off of it, just like they got rich off of derivatives.
[02:02:40.788 --> 02:02:50.513]  Yeah, they looted us two years ago, and now they're looting Europe, and they're just like a group of carrion crows that fly around eating the flesh off our bones.
[02:02:50.513 --> 02:02:52.914]  And the media doesn't ever explain it.
[02:02:53.646 --> 02:03:00.532]  They just provide the free propaganda that keeps the money running into the hedge funds and the New York investment banks.
[02:03:04.753 --> 02:03:13.820]  A manual of British Naval War College documents on pirate accounts from the 16, 17, 1800s.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:20.145]  And the way this elite behaves is kind of like pirates, where they just wildly wouldn't even pull the corks off whiskey bottles.
[02:03:20.145 --> 02:03:24.389]  They would just hack the tops off and just drink it down.
[02:03:24.389 --> 02:03:30.854]  So there's a method to the madness, Doctor, but overall, do you agree that they're just complete out-of-control lunatics?
[02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:38.054]  Yes, and in fact I would even say pirates had more honor.
[02:03:38.054 --> 02:03:42.296]  So they're worse than pirates.
[02:03:42.296 --> 02:03:44.317]  And nothing is being done about it.
[02:03:44.317 --> 02:03:50.421]  You notice the regulation of the financial system, nothing happens.
[02:03:50.421 --> 02:03:56.464]  Or it's all watered down, or it's turned into something that enables them to plunder more.
[02:03:56.464 --> 02:04:00.267]  Yeah, now they're going to take over all the little banks and track every purchase we make.
[02:04:00.267 --> 02:04:00.707]  That's right.
[02:04:02.212 --> 02:04:09.157]  You'll see massive financial concentration, which is probably another reason for all this trouble.
[02:04:09.157 --> 02:04:16.042]  That's probably what they're trying to do, is to get rid of the large number of banks.
[02:04:16.042 --> 02:04:17.944]  It's just a few large ones.
[02:04:17.944 --> 02:04:23.167]  It's the same thing they did to the media when they concentrated it in the hands of a few giant firms.
[02:04:25.769 --> 02:04:28.830]  But nobody is going to tell the people.
[02:04:28.830 --> 02:04:34.832]  The Congress isn't going to hold those kind of hearings, and the press is not going to do any investigation.
[02:04:34.832 --> 02:04:43.554]  Well, Doc, good job on reporting on the huge breaking news of the POW cover-up, completely confirmed by a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.
[02:04:43.554 --> 02:04:45.235]  We'll talk to you again soon, Lord willing.
[02:04:45.235 --> 02:04:47.055]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[02:04:47.055 --> 02:04:48.676]  Glad to be with you, Alex.
[02:04:48.676 --> 02:04:50.976]  It's always informative, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:04:50.976 --> 02:04:52.257]  Ray McGovern, coming up.
[02:04:52.257 --> 02:04:52.797]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.479 --> 02:04:57.780]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:03.365]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:03.365 --> 02:05:08.389]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:08.389 --> 02:05:13.434]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:05:13.954 --> 02:05:19.179]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:19.179 --> 02:05:26.305]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:05:26.305 --> 02:05:27.425]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:27.425 --> 02:05:33.771]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:34.091 --> 02:05:37.273]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:37.273 --> 02:05:39.495]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:39.495 --> 02:05:40.375]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:05:40.375 --> 02:05:40.695]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:40.695 --> 02:05:44.077]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:44.077 --> 02:05:45.819]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:56.854 --> 02:05:59.878]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:59.878 --> 02:06:05.205]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:05.205 --> 02:06:07.248]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:07.248 --> 02:06:12.254]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:12.254 --> 02:06:13.436]  How much do you want?
[02:06:13.436 --> 02:06:14.177]  When do you want it?
[02:06:14.537 --> 02:06:16.417]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:16.417 --> 02:06:17.498]  When will you need it?
[02:06:17.498 --> 02:06:19.698]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:19.698 --> 02:06:21.039]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:21.039 --> 02:06:22.579]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:22.579 --> 02:06:27.840]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:31.421]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:31.421 --> 02:06:34.882]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:35.242 --> 02:06:36.462]  How much will you need?
[02:06:36.462 --> 02:06:37.363]  We don't know.
[02:06:37.363 --> 02:06:38.463]  How much do you want?
[02:06:38.463 --> 02:06:39.403]  All you can get.
[02:06:39.403 --> 02:06:40.504]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:40.504 --> 02:06:43.545]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:43.545 --> 02:06:45.305]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:45.305 --> 02:06:46.246]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:55.936 --> 02:06:57.236]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:57.236 --> 02:07:02.818]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:07:02.818 --> 02:07:07.840]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:12.862]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:07:13.402 --> 02:07:18.626]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:07:18.626 --> 02:07:20.947]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:07:20.947 --> 02:07:25.750]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:26.871]  And here's the best part.
[02:07:26.871 --> 02:07:29.933]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:07:29.933 --> 02:07:33.556]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:07:33.556 --> 02:07:36.758]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:07:36.758 --> 02:07:38.979]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:07:38.979 --> 02:07:39.900]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:07:43.622 --> 02:07:47.763]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:07:47.763 --> 02:07:52.584]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:52.584 --> 02:07:57.506]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:57.506 --> 02:08:03.047]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:05.154 --> 02:08:07.736]  Okay, he joins us to talk about a host of issues.
[02:08:07.736 --> 02:08:12.079]  What's happening on the Korean Peninsula, which could lead to nuclear war.
[02:08:12.079 --> 02:08:14.541]  I mean, that's all over the headlines.
[02:08:14.541 --> 02:08:17.864]  Israel's saying they may go into Iran sooner rather than later.
[02:08:17.864 --> 02:08:19.085]  That's back on the front burner.
[02:08:19.085 --> 02:08:22.127]  You know, is there a Fox Fallon to stop it?
[02:08:23.408 --> 02:08:26.229]  What will Admiral Mullen do?
[02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:28.490]  You've got this global financial meltdown happening.
[02:08:28.490 --> 02:08:32.711]  You notice world wars always start during a major global meltdown.
[02:08:32.711 --> 02:08:34.112]  There's a method to this madness.
[02:08:34.112 --> 02:08:41.274]  I also want to ask him later about CIA units' wacky idea to pick Saddam as gay.
[02:08:41.274 --> 02:08:42.475]  That's not the issue.
[02:08:42.475 --> 02:08:46.036]  Buried in the Washington Post article, they quote the CIA officers as
[02:08:46.676 --> 02:08:49.358]  Producing fake Bin Laden videos.
[02:08:49.358 --> 02:08:53.080]  Now people have looked at the video of the fat Bin Laden and admitted it's fake.
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.501]  They've had linguists listen to it.
[02:08:54.501 --> 02:08:55.922]  It's not him, not the dialect.
[02:08:55.922 --> 02:08:57.463]  They've done voice print.
[02:08:57.463 --> 02:09:00.906]  These tapes are basically all fake or old tapes of him re-edited.
[02:09:00.906 --> 02:09:03.067]  I want to ask Ray McGovern about that.
[02:09:03.067 --> 02:09:11.633]  We're going to get into suddenly New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Geraldo Rivera with the Marine Corps commander.
[02:09:11.633 --> 02:09:13.974]  We're here helping the Afghans grow the opium.
[02:09:13.974 --> 02:09:16.196]  We have to or al-Qaeda will get the opium.
[02:09:17.277 --> 02:09:19.759]  I mean, folks, they're really coming out in the open.
[02:09:19.759 --> 02:09:21.501]  Yeah, we put out fake Bin Laden tapes.
[02:09:21.501 --> 02:09:23.623]  Yeah, we're growing the smack.
[02:09:23.623 --> 02:09:26.285]  Yeah, yeah, we left the POWs.
[02:09:26.285 --> 02:09:32.011]  Pulitzer Prize winning reports are now getting a lot of news on that front.
[02:09:32.011 --> 02:09:32.871]  So we'll talk about it all.
[02:09:32.871 --> 02:09:34.293]  Ray McGovern was in Vietnam, by the way.
[02:09:34.293 --> 02:09:38.116]  So we're going to cover it all in the next hour with him today.
[02:09:39.737 --> 02:09:43.418]  Ray McGovern is an activist who writes and lectures all over the country.
[02:09:43.418 --> 02:09:51.021]  He's co-founder of Veterans Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, and we really appreciate him joining us.
[02:09:51.021 --> 02:10:05.425]  He was one of the chief CIA briefers for Reagan and Bush Sr., and that's a key position in a focal point position where you have Pentagon liaison to CIA, you have CIA liaison to White House.
[02:10:05.425 --> 02:10:06.986]  These focal officers like
[02:10:07.366 --> 02:10:17.128]  Fletcher Prouty and the Secret Team, again, have unique perspective on wide-ranging analysis and how it ties in, not just specialists.
[02:10:17.128 --> 02:10:21.690]  So they can draw on all the specialists, and so that's why it's such an important lens to have them on with us.
[02:10:21.690 --> 02:10:25.650]  So I've thrown out there, sir, what I want to cover with you in the next 50 minutes.
[02:10:25.650 --> 02:10:31.552]  You've got the floor with what, of that cornucopia, that you think is most important in your breakdown on what we're facing.
[02:10:32.964 --> 02:10:34.204]  Alex, thanks.
[02:10:34.204 --> 02:10:40.887]  First, just to make sure the record is correct, I don't want to pull a boom and fall from Connecticut here.
[02:10:40.887 --> 02:10:43.528]  I didn't serve actually in Vietnam.
[02:10:43.528 --> 02:10:50.810]  I was an army infantry intelligence officer from 62 to 64 before Vietnam really started.
[02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:57.113]  And while I was going on, I was the principal analyst at the CIA for Soviet policy toward Vietnam.
[02:10:57.113 --> 02:11:00.554]  So I learned quite a bit about it, but I never set foot in the country.
[02:11:01.525 --> 02:11:22.554]  With respect to what's going on here, the most important thing that's happening today is that David Obie, Chair of Appropriations in the House, is letting some lipstick go on the $33 billion appropriation for escalating war in Afghanistan.
[02:11:22.554 --> 02:11:27.897]  And that lipstick is $23 billion for teachers so that they don't lose their jobs.
[02:11:29.269 --> 02:11:31.651]  Obi knows better.
[02:11:31.651 --> 02:11:38.676]  What he's done here is bowed to the Washington establishment that want to continue this war.
[02:11:38.676 --> 02:11:58.249]  It looks very much as though what he will report out of his committee this evening is a bill that includes $23 billion for teachers to keep the schools going and $33 billion for Afghanistan to keep that feckless war going and more and more people being killed.
[02:12:00.049 --> 02:12:09.792]  It's just really, I was a former admirer of David Obie, and so I wrote him a memorandum that has appeared already on AfterDowningStreet.com.
[02:12:09.792 --> 02:12:13.613]  I guess it's now called WarIsACrime.org.
[02:12:13.613 --> 02:12:26.537]  And you can see that he's being completely disingenuous, because as recently as two months ago, he told a TV interviewer that this Afghanistan adventure, it's a fool's errand.
[02:12:27.771 --> 02:12:30.172]  But if we're going to do it, we have to pay for it.
[02:12:30.172 --> 02:12:32.374]  You know, we have to fully fund it.
[02:12:32.374 --> 02:12:35.636]  Now, what kind of logic does that make, Alex?
[02:12:35.636 --> 02:12:39.719]  It's a fool's errand, but if we're going to do it, we've got to fund it.
[02:12:39.719 --> 02:12:45.383]  Well, Ryan McGovern, let me throw this out at you, and then you can expand on your concern with what's happening in Afghanistan, expanding into Pakistan.
[02:12:46.124 --> 02:13:07.133]  But in layman's terms, I'm somebody who sits there and studies it for years, and so I want your perspective, and correct me if I'm wrong, you've got all these pipelines going through there, trillions in the aggregate of oil, hundreds of billions in no-bid contract black holes, so the defense lobby likes it, the oil lobby likes it, Israel likes it because that gets the U.S.
[02:13:07.133 --> 02:13:11.175]  more firmly burrowed into the Middle East and Central Asia, so that lobby likes it.
[02:13:12.355 --> 02:13:38.834]  But more importantly, 500 billion a year, 91% now, it was a lot lower, of the opium pouring out into Russia, into Asia, kind of a replay of the Boxer Rebellion, part two, and now our troops are admittedly over there, quote, protecting the poppy fields, and so I think you've got at least the contractors that's coming out, that's what Sybil Edmonds said pre-911, shipping the opium into Turkey, you name it, and so it's really about
[02:13:39.694 --> 02:13:41.656]  Well, that's part of it, Alex, to be sure.
[02:13:41.656 --> 02:13:44.198]  The other part is a more kind of geopolitical adventure here.
[02:13:44.198 --> 02:13:44.758]  Imperialism is not dead.
[02:13:59.699 --> 02:14:11.422]  If you look at Afghanistan, you'll see that it's strategically located in the same neighborhood as China, as Iran, as Russia really, Turkey, Iraq.
[02:14:11.422 --> 02:14:13.643]  It's right there in the middle of things.
[02:14:13.643 --> 02:14:21.025]  And so the way the empire looks at things is, well, we've got to be in there firstest with the mostest.
[02:14:21.885 --> 02:14:30.728]  Even if it's mostly an attempt to deny the Chinese or the Russians or the Indians or whomever from getting in there before we were.
[02:14:30.728 --> 02:14:35.749]  Now, what makes Afghanistan strategic?
[02:14:35.749 --> 02:14:46.793]  Well, one of the things that makes it strategic is that it lies directly beneath a country called Turkmenistan, which used to be part of the Soviet Union, and Turkmenistan has in it
[02:14:48.135 --> 02:14:52.904]  Natural gas deposits worth all the oil under the sands of Iraq.
[02:14:54.523 --> 02:15:04.449]  Now, the problem is, Chevron's in there, a lot of the oil companies are in there, natural gas companies, but you can't get it here from there, okay?
[02:15:04.449 --> 02:15:11.694]  You gotta do a pipeline, and you can't have that pipeline go through Russia, you have to have it go south, and guess what?
[02:15:11.694 --> 02:15:23.722]  The next country is Afghanistan, and then Pakistan, and then a little slice of India, and at the terminal of this projected pipeline, all the studies were done and was ready to go, guess what?
[02:15:24.282 --> 02:15:30.968]  Enron was supposed to be the person marketing that natural gas, so the whole thing is as corrupt as can be.
[02:15:30.968 --> 02:15:40.496]  The Taliban visited Houston, Texas when Governor George Bush expressed interest in what was going on there with this pipeline.
[02:15:40.496 --> 02:15:48.983]  Our ambassador to Afghanistan and later to Iraq, Khalid Zard, was one of the people involved in this, and so was Karzai.
[02:15:49.563 --> 02:15:51.345]  Yeah, he was the Unicole executive.
[02:15:51.345 --> 02:15:53.407]  Yeah, so that's part of it.
[02:15:53.407 --> 02:15:54.908]  Now I'm not saying that's the whole thing.
[02:15:54.908 --> 02:16:02.756]  The whole ball of wax involves the strategic location and what needs to happen here, Alex, in my view, is pretty simple.
[02:16:02.756 --> 02:16:05.659]  There's a finite amount of oil.
[02:16:05.659 --> 02:16:09.723]  There's a finite amount of natural gas in this world.
[02:16:10.490 --> 02:16:22.274]  Now, if we're going to try to seize it all or seize control of it, then, you know, Iraq can be looked on as simply the first resource war of the 21st century.
[02:16:22.274 --> 02:16:28.057]  What we have to do is what my four-year-old grandson learns in nursery school.
[02:16:28.057 --> 02:16:32.558]  I went up and I asked his teacher, what do you expect to teach these kids?
[02:16:32.558 --> 02:16:34.039]  And she said, oh, that's simple.
[02:16:34.039 --> 02:16:36.600]  We teach them that they have to learn to share.
[02:16:37.478 --> 02:16:37.818]  I think so.
[02:16:57.341 --> 02:16:58.621]  Figure out how to share it.
[02:16:58.621 --> 02:16:59.802]  And jointly develop it.
[02:16:59.802 --> 02:17:01.862]  Instead, I mean, we go back to 53.
[02:17:01.862 --> 02:17:05.644]  That's what caused the whole Iran thing, as you know.
[02:17:05.644 --> 02:17:12.686]  Mohammad Mozadek said, we're going to keep 25% of our own money to American oil companies and British oil companies.
[02:17:12.686 --> 02:17:15.086]  And they said, no, we get everything.
[02:17:15.086 --> 02:17:17.847]  We overthrow you using the Muslim extremists.
[02:17:17.847 --> 02:17:19.788]  I mean, it's the same story every time.
[02:17:19.788 --> 02:17:20.288]  That's right.
[02:17:20.288 --> 02:17:25.890]  Well, that was a company called BP, actually, which I think has been in the news lately.
[02:17:25.890 --> 02:17:26.750]  You get a corrupt
[02:17:27.523 --> 02:17:28.603]  I don't think so.
[02:17:54.871 --> 02:18:01.253]  And the people of the world, the simple people like you and me, Alex, have a real, real problem.
[02:18:01.253 --> 02:18:03.314]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[02:18:03.314 --> 02:18:05.435]  I think, what was BP called?
[02:18:05.435 --> 02:18:06.655]  Anglo-American Oil?
[02:18:06.655 --> 02:18:08.636]  Yeah, that's what they call themselves.
[02:18:08.636 --> 02:18:10.796]  But BP is a direct descendant.
[02:18:10.796 --> 02:18:11.256]  No, exactly.
[02:18:11.256 --> 02:18:14.077]  I mean, it's the same company, you're absolutely right, in that Dutch partnership.
[02:18:14.077 --> 02:18:18.199]  But, I mean, it's the same players over and over again.
[02:18:18.199 --> 02:18:18.639]  Yeah.
[02:18:19.699 --> 02:18:23.401]  Well, it's just that they are so powerful.
[02:18:23.401 --> 02:18:26.102]  And here's Obama, you know.
[02:18:26.102 --> 02:18:45.072]  He was asked just a half hour ago at his press conference, you know, do you feel a little funny about that decision you made two weeks before the oil blowup in the Gulf when you said that, yeah, we have to drill offshore and these companies, you know, have reduced the dangers greatly.
[02:18:47.573 --> 02:18:56.437]  Well, I still think we have to drill offshore, but my mistake was taking the word of the companies.
[02:18:56.437 --> 02:19:01.299]  Well, for Pete's sake, of course they take the word of the companies.
[02:19:01.299 --> 02:19:09.123]  Look at the people that they had in the Interior Department, people who are still there, taking bribes and everything else from the oil companies.
[02:19:09.543 --> 02:19:11.545]  The system is corrupt.
[02:19:11.545 --> 02:19:30.206]  What Mama should have done is come in, got rid of all those people, given them jobs in the library if you couldn't fire them, and get some real, real control over these precious resources, despite the avarice and the desire of people like BP to control this important resource.
[02:19:31.607 --> 02:19:33.048]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes
[02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:03.150]  I don't think so.
[02:20:16.653 --> 02:20:16.953]  I think so.

[02:21:59.631 --> 02:22:03.794]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:22:03.794 --> 02:22:06.075]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:06.075 --> 02:22:11.238]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:22:11.238 --> 02:22:13.039]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:22:13.039 --> 02:22:14.360]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:16.062]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:22:16.062 --> 02:22:19.446]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:22:19.446 --> 02:22:24.812]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.

[02:22:57.236 --> 02:22:57.997]  The problem.
[02:22:57.997 --> 02:23:00.578]  How do I cook food without power?
[02:23:00.578 --> 02:23:03.280]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:05.962]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[02:23:05.962 --> 02:23:08.443]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[02:23:08.443 --> 02:23:17.229]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.

[02:24:03.214 --> 02:24:06.957]  I can't wait to get into North Korea and see what Ray McGovern thinks about that.
[02:24:06.957 --> 02:24:22.607]  All I see is headlines everywhere about possible nuclear war and shelling Seoul and the disputed areas with the ships and China's in Bloomberg saying we may shield North Korea and the Pentagon saying they're ready for war.
[02:24:22.607 --> 02:24:24.008]  The war was never terminated.
[02:24:24.008 --> 02:24:26.209]  It's been a ceasefire for 50 plus years.
[02:24:26.209 --> 02:24:28.791]  Going back to Ray McGovern, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:30.836 --> 02:24:36.860]  When I interrupted you earlier with some other questions about why they're there, where do you see Afghanistan going?
[02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:46.767]  I mean, two weeks ago, they said a thousand drones are being dispatched for Pakistan and Afghanistan and that now they don't have to identify somebody before they kill them.
[02:24:46.767 --> 02:24:54.812]  Just if you look like you're a terrorist, kind of like those kids in Baghdad in the minivan look like terrorists and reporters with cameras look like terrorists.
[02:24:54.812 --> 02:24:57.354]  I mean, this sounds like an incredible escalation.
[02:24:57.354 --> 02:24:58.695]  It sounds like LBJ in 1966.
[02:25:01.517 --> 02:25:11.587]  Well, funny you should mention that, Alex, because I was thinking of this wonderful new airplane, aircraft, that had been developed around then.
[02:25:11.587 --> 02:25:14.771]  It was called a B-52.
[02:25:14.771 --> 02:25:18.955]  And, you know, that was going to solve all our problems in Vietnam.
[02:25:18.955 --> 02:25:23.400]  What we're going to do is bomb the hell out of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[02:25:24.159 --> 02:25:30.969]  And LBJ came to us, intelligence types, and said that these blue suited generals are telling me this will do it.
[02:25:30.969 --> 02:25:32.611]  What do you think?
[02:25:32.611 --> 02:25:34.094]  Now, we suppressed the laugh.
[02:25:35.037 --> 02:25:49.561]  You know, having known about the effect of aircraft in World War II, and knowing that it simply increases the resistance of populations like the Vietnamese, and we waited two days and then we gave them an estimate.
[02:25:49.561 --> 02:25:54.422]  We used to do national intelligence estimates, and now they're not done very much anymore.
[02:25:54.422 --> 02:25:57.043]  And we told the president, look, Mr. President,
[02:25:57.743 --> 02:26:04.528]  Ho Chi Minh is not the kind of person who's going to give up under how many B-52s or how heavy the bombs they drop.
[02:26:04.528 --> 02:26:16.936]  And besides, Mr. President, you should be aware that the Ho Chi Minh Trail doesn't look anything like, ooh, I-81 or I-95 or the George Washington Memorial Parkway.
[02:26:16.936 --> 02:26:21.319]  You can't even see it from the air in many respects.
[02:26:21.319 --> 02:26:24.061]  It's about 181 trails, Mr. President.
[02:26:24.061 --> 02:26:27.183]  Ain't no way that B-52s are going to do the job.
[02:26:27.943 --> 02:26:33.565]  Now, we were right, of course, but the corollary there is the President doesn't have to heed intelligence.
[02:26:33.565 --> 02:26:38.386]  He just didn't want to lose a war, and so he said, well, let's try these blue-suited guys.
[02:26:38.386 --> 02:26:41.527]  You know, they might be right, and so he tried it, and we know the answer.
[02:26:41.527 --> 02:26:44.587]  Now, similarly, here we are over in Afghanistan.
[02:26:44.587 --> 02:26:50.809]  We have this new weapon, which most people don't realize, Alex, and I knew about this when it was being developed.
[02:26:51.409 --> 02:27:02.851]  It was developed for a specific purpose, and that purpose only, and that was to give us a hovering capability where we could monitor developments on the ground more than two times a day.
[02:27:02.851 --> 02:27:07.772]  Two times a day being when the satellites would pass over these areas, okay?
[02:27:07.772 --> 02:27:10.153]  Now, we got this thing developed.
[02:27:10.153 --> 02:27:17.454]  It worked beautifully, and then it was shown to some general in the Pentagon, and he said, I want to see the tank.
[02:27:17.454 --> 02:27:19.175]  I want to destroy the tank.
[02:27:19.175 --> 02:27:20.755]  Put some missiles on that bird.
[02:27:22.065 --> 02:27:37.818]  Therefore, you get predators, you get reapers with hellfire missiles, and you get an awful lot of disenchantment and hostility out of the people in Pakistan in particular that are being bombed to hell by these things.
[02:27:37.818 --> 02:27:40.140]  It's looked on as a very cowardly thing.
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:57.644]  That's right at a primitive level having like Terminator machines out of the sky bombing you and it's literally 22 year old zit face kids in trailers thousands of miles away in a video game set up and go ahead you got a wedding we think
[02:27:57.904 --> 02:27:59.845]  Well, some guy's got a gun in there.
[02:27:59.845 --> 02:28:01.846]  Everybody's got guns in those countries.
[02:28:01.846 --> 02:28:04.768]  I mean, it's a tribal, you know, red-blooded type area.
[02:28:04.768 --> 02:28:07.429]  And then they, you know, they kill a hundred innocent people.
[02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:15.694]  Now you've created a thousand enemies because their entire family and every cousin they've got who may have loved America back in the 80s, they're ready to kill.
[02:28:15.694 --> 02:28:18.135]  They're ready to trade their life to kill Americans.
[02:28:18.135 --> 02:28:20.456]  And so the idea is pump more Americans in.
[02:28:20.456 --> 02:28:22.597]  That's exactly right.
[02:28:22.597 --> 02:28:27.340]  And, you know, people have asked me, these Hellfire missiles, are they accurate?
[02:28:28.064 --> 02:28:30.267]  And I say, well, yeah, they are.
[02:28:30.267 --> 02:28:33.190]  They're extremely accurate.
[02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:35.412]  They're more accurate than anything we've had up until now.
[02:28:35.412 --> 02:28:39.177]  But the question is, how do you identify the targets?
[02:28:39.875 --> 02:28:44.779]  Now, you know, you can really tell what a militant is from 30,000 feet, can't you?
[02:28:44.779 --> 02:28:46.160]  Give me a break.
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:59.009]  You can really find out who the Taliban and the al-Qaeda types are by asking their neighbors who have these, asking people's neighbors who have unsatisfied grudges against them.
[02:28:59.009 --> 02:29:03.532]  The targets are the name of the game, and if you get targets,
[02:29:03.932 --> 02:29:12.115]  From people who have grudges or from 22-year-olds looking from 30,000 feet up, you've got a real problem.
[02:29:12.115 --> 02:29:29.621]  What really tells, what I find really telling, Alex, is these Reapers and these Predators, interesting the labels they give these aircraft, they're controlled by these young NCOs out at Creech Air Force Base near Las Vegas.
[02:29:29.921 --> 02:29:30.541]  Stay there, sir.
[02:29:30.541 --> 02:29:31.102]  We got a break.
[02:29:31.102 --> 02:29:31.822]  Long segment.
[02:29:31.822 --> 02:29:40.788]  We'll go back to Creek Air Force Base and talk about the Predators and drones with Ray McGovern, CIA analyst, a briefer to the presidents.
[02:29:40.788 --> 02:29:42.329]  Very honored to have him here with us today.
[02:29:42.329 --> 02:29:43.630]  He's got a new article out.
[02:29:43.630 --> 02:29:44.891]  We'll put that on screen as well.
[02:29:44.891 --> 02:29:47.292]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.292 --> 02:29:48.693]  We're on the march.
[02:29:48.693 --> 02:29:51.215]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.215 --> 02:29:53.897]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.356 --> 02:30:02.317]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:02.317 --> 02:30:11.179]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:11.179 --> 02:30:15.800]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:26.622]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:30:27.262 --> 02:30:36.765]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:36.765 --> 02:30:42.207]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:30:42.207 --> 02:30:49.690]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:49.690 --> 02:30:52.451]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:30:56.383 --> 02:31:00.567]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:00.567 --> 02:31:06.972]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:06.972 --> 02:31:14.359]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:14.359 --> 02:31:19.243]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:31:19.243 --> 02:31:21.385]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:31:24.167 --> 02:31:27.931]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:31:27.931 --> 02:31:30.213]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:31:30.213 --> 02:31:30.554]  Call us!
[02:31:43.667 --> 02:31:43.947]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[02:31:48.512 --> 02:31:48.893]  Thank you.
[02:31:48.893 --> 02:31:51.916]  You may be arrested and or subject to...
[02:32:00.245 --> 02:32:01.506]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:01.506 --> 02:32:05.371]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:05.371 --> 02:32:07.673]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:07.673 --> 02:32:13.539]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:13.539 --> 02:32:19.766]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:20.186 --> 02:32:26.169]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:26.169 --> 02:32:30.350]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:30.350 --> 02:32:34.632]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:34.632 --> 02:32:40.594]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:40.594 --> 02:32:44.136]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:44.136 --> 02:32:46.117]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:46.117 --> 02:32:46.557]  It's here.

[02:33:00.142 --> 02:33:08.605]  We're going back to Ray McGovern here in a moment to get into the Predator drones and where he sees Afghanistan and Pakistan going.
[02:33:11.531 --> 02:33:19.714]  And basically, he says they're repeating the same things that happened in Vietnam, but now they have fancier, fancier weaponry.
[02:33:19.714 --> 02:33:21.294]  We'll go back to him in just a moment.
[02:33:21.294 --> 02:33:28.916]  We're going into North Korea with him and the situation with Iran, which to me is even scarier, the whole Iran situation.
[02:33:28.916 --> 02:33:38.579]  A quagmire is one thing and can get a lot of troops killed and waste a lot of money, but war with Iran, in my layman research, looks even worse.
[02:33:38.579 --> 02:33:40.660]  So we'll discuss that in a moment with our guest.
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:42.601]  Survivalseedbank.com
[02:34:00.811 --> 02:34:03.092]  This is Survival Seed Bank, a time capsule.
[02:34:03.092 --> 02:34:06.574]  Buy one, plant one, save the other, or just buy one.
[02:34:06.574 --> 02:34:10.716]  Survivalseedbank.com, 877-327-0365.
[02:34:10.716 --> 02:34:18.860]  It's good to start to become self-sufficient with this depression the central banks have designed to turn us into their economic slaves.
[02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:20.021]  Survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:34:20.021 --> 02:34:20.081]  877-327-0365.
[02:34:20.081 --> 02:34:22.002]  And one other great sponsor I want to tell you about.
[02:34:29.566 --> 02:34:38.229]  I love the swords, the knives, the machetes, the tools, the tasers, the pepper spray.

[02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:43.991]  That's Weapons-Universe.
[02:34:43.991 --> 02:34:47.312]  So just the word weapons and then dash universe dot com.
[02:34:47.312 --> 02:34:50.092]  And we've got a link up on InfoWars.com as well.
[02:34:50.092 --> 02:34:51.953]  That's Weapons-Universe.com.
[02:34:55.334 --> 02:34:59.838]  And just a lot of amazing stuff and great prices by you name it.
[02:34:59.838 --> 02:35:07.145]  Names like Cold Steel, Smith & Wesson, Weapons-Universe.com and their great patriots.
[02:35:07.145 --> 02:35:09.327]  Check them out today at Weapons-Universe.com.
[02:35:09.327 --> 02:35:10.749]  Okay, Ray, I've been adding my points.
[02:35:10.749 --> 02:35:11.830]  You got cut off by the break.
[02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:14.653]  You were getting into, they're out in Nevada.
[02:35:14.653 --> 02:35:15.914]  It's one of the main command centers.
[02:35:15.914 --> 02:35:17.175]  I've seen it on the news.
[02:35:17.175 --> 02:35:19.958]  People in trailers and he's like,
[02:35:21.331 --> 02:35:22.312]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:35:22.312 --> 02:35:27.235]  The chaplains out there at Creech Air Force Base, they're working overtime.
[02:35:27.235 --> 02:35:28.555]  Because some of these young fellas have a conscience.
[02:35:48.477 --> 02:35:49.700]  They do their work during the day.
[02:35:49.700 --> 02:35:57.533]  They go home and have dinner with their families and they think, hmm, the wife says, well, we'll have to have things go at work today.
[02:35:59.208 --> 02:36:08.035]  They can't quite say, well, we killed, you know, we shot Hellfire missiles at 30 groups and we're not real sure.
[02:36:08.035 --> 02:36:18.124]  So, long story short, these chaplains are actually being visited regularly by these poor NCOs who are ordered to do this kind of thing and have it on their conscience, to their credit.
[02:36:18.784 --> 02:36:24.566]  The other guys, now the other guys are the ones in Langley, Virginia, who are working for the CIA.
[02:36:24.566 --> 02:36:29.387]  They're the ones that have the joysticks there, and they're the ones that fly over Pakistan.
[02:36:29.387 --> 02:36:30.147]  Why?
[02:36:30.147 --> 02:36:37.169]  Well, because we're literally, or at least technically not at war with Pakistan, so it has to be the CIA.
[02:36:37.169 --> 02:36:38.709]  It can't be the Air Force.
[02:36:38.709 --> 02:36:40.309]  Well, it's the same sort of thing.
[02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:45.991]  People who identify these targets, either from people who may have grief,
[02:36:46.311 --> 02:36:46.752]  We're good.
[02:37:02.312 --> 02:37:13.182]  It is an indication of a lack of leadership in the military of our country, as well as on the political side, because you can't win a war this way.
[02:37:13.182 --> 02:37:15.845]  All you can do is alienate the affections of people.
[02:37:15.845 --> 02:37:23.031]  And what I keep telling people is that in Pakistan, if you take the population of Pakistan, 165, 170 million, okay?
[02:37:23.031 --> 02:37:23.852]  That's 40 million more.
[02:37:28.803 --> 02:37:34.287]  And the population of Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq put together.
[02:37:34.287 --> 02:37:37.790]  Besides, of course, Pakistan has nuclear weapons.
[02:37:37.790 --> 02:37:44.936]  Now, which, I would ask you, which country should be the most important not to alienate the population in?
[02:37:45.305 --> 02:38:04.573]  Well, sir, we've seen Pakistani leaders, and we've got an article up on InfoWars.com that's got the newscast and even ABC News, with Pakistani leaders saying, look, your government is running a lot of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and they're using it to destabilize our country, and you know, and that's what Hamid Ghul, who I
[02:38:05.558 --> 02:38:19.382]  I was bizarrely contacted by a year and a half ago, and he came on this show, and it made national news when he did, and he said that they're killing these tribal groups to actually get them up in arms, and that's what Gerald Salenta, the Trends Forecaster, says.
[02:38:19.382 --> 02:38:20.823]  He says, look, the U.S.
[02:38:20.823 --> 02:38:26.024]  government isn't going to have to stage terror attacks as a pretext to get the American people to give their liberty up.
[02:38:26.024 --> 02:38:31.446]  You kill enough Pakistanis who are tribal, they're going to come over here and they're going to blow stuff up.
[02:38:33.052 --> 02:38:36.714]  Well, we've seen the effects of that, haven't we?
[02:38:36.714 --> 02:38:45.859]  You know, when Bush said we have to kill them over there before they come here, well, you know, that was ridiculous in the extreme.
[02:38:45.859 --> 02:38:51.642]  What we need to do is figure out what's really going on in those countries, why they hate us.
[02:38:51.642 --> 02:38:55.765]  You know, it ain't because of our democracy or our freedom.
[02:38:55.765 --> 02:38:57.826]  Now, with respect to the Pakistanis,
[02:38:58.944 --> 02:39:00.305]  You can see U.S.
[02:39:00.305 --> 02:39:15.752]  high-level pronouncements say, we're working on the Pakistanis to show them, to demonstrate that their greatest threat is not from India, no, no, it's from these insurgents, these militants, these people that are in the tribal areas, right?
[02:39:15.752 --> 02:39:16.813]  Well, give me a break.
[02:39:17.789 --> 02:39:25.532]  There's no kind of rhetoric or logic that is going to persuade the Pakistanis that their main enemy isn't India.
[02:39:25.532 --> 02:39:26.612]  Of course it is.
[02:39:26.612 --> 02:39:29.313]  And so why do they keep feeding the Taliban?
[02:39:29.313 --> 02:39:31.834]  Why do they keep making it difficult for the U.S.
[02:39:31.834 --> 02:39:33.335]  to end the job there?
[02:39:33.335 --> 02:39:38.456]  Because they see an advantage in keeping the pot boiling in Afghanistan.
[02:39:38.456 --> 02:39:41.017]  They don't want an Indian-dominated government in Afghanistan.
[02:39:43.158 --> 02:39:43.559]  I think so.
[02:40:00.962 --> 02:40:16.323]  And the worst news, of course, is that our congressional people, even the good ones like Dave Obie, have now caved again, and it looks like there will be an escalation to the tune of $33 billion, and that will buy many more months of killing and war.
[02:40:16.747 --> 02:40:21.530]  People can go to Common Dreams website and others and read your new article.
[02:40:21.530 --> 02:40:23.752]  Give folks that title again one more time, right?
[02:40:23.752 --> 02:40:27.875]  Well, it's a letter to David Obie, who's the head of appropriations.
[02:40:27.875 --> 02:40:35.600]  It's a memo that says, look, you know, you called Afghanistan a fool's errand.
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:36.241]  And then you said,
[02:40:36.949 --> 02:40:38.770]  Yeah, but we have to fund it.
[02:40:38.770 --> 02:40:41.571]  That doesn't make any logical sense, Dave.
[02:40:41.571 --> 02:40:53.557]  What's really going on here, and what's really going on here is he's out of there in January, he wants to not alienate the affections of the Washington establishment, and he's letting go to the House.
[02:40:54.077 --> 02:41:03.639]  A bill that will include enough lipstick, namely the $23 billion for teachers, so that the $33 billion for Afghanistan war will go through.
[02:41:03.639 --> 02:41:05.319]  That is unconscionable.
[02:41:05.319 --> 02:41:06.939]  He knows better than that.
[02:41:06.939 --> 02:41:20.982]  And he can call me an idiot liberal, or that's what he calls some of my friends, but what I'm telling him is that he's in terrible disappointment because he should have stood his ground and not confessed to being quote, bone tired.
[02:41:21.622 --> 02:41:24.483]  And again, Ray, this has nothing to do with liberal-conservative.
[02:41:24.483 --> 02:41:25.724]  It's right and wrong.
[02:41:25.724 --> 02:41:27.584]  Obama is expanding the wars.
[02:41:27.584 --> 02:41:28.905]  Bush expanded it.
[02:41:28.905 --> 02:41:32.206]  This is the policy of the establishment.
[02:41:32.206 --> 02:41:36.227]  But just briefly, because I want to get into Iran and then North Korea and the time we've got left with you.
[02:41:36.227 --> 02:41:37.047]  I'm picking your brain.
[02:41:37.047 --> 02:41:38.448]  We appreciate the time.
[02:41:38.448 --> 02:41:41.149]  And of course, you just come on out of the goodness of your heart to do it.
[02:41:41.149 --> 02:41:46.931]  I wish you had a book or something we could promote for folks to get your word out even more, but hopefully that's coming in the future.
[02:41:46.931 --> 02:41:48.552]  But over the years, you've been so gracious.
[02:41:48.552 --> 02:41:49.212]  That is my point.
[02:41:50.233 --> 02:41:51.755]  What is the exit strategy?
[02:41:51.755 --> 02:41:56.844]  Is the exit strategy never leave like Germany or Japan or South Korea?
[02:41:56.844 --> 02:41:59.428]  I mean is the exit strategy quagmire?
[02:42:00.711 --> 02:42:06.976]  Well, I asked Khalid Zard, our former ambassador in Afghanistan, he's actually an Afghan.
[02:42:06.976 --> 02:42:16.944]  I asked him at a RAND conference two months ago, I said, you know, you don't say much about the oil pipeline anymore or the natural gas pipeline to Afghanistan.
[02:42:16.944 --> 02:42:18.045]  What does that stand?
[02:42:18.045 --> 02:42:19.386]  You were in on that from the beginning.
[02:42:19.386 --> 02:42:21.748]  And he thought for a second and he said,
[02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:35.474]  Well, you know, with all the violence and all the fighting there along the pipeline route, we can't possibly build it right now.
[02:42:36.477 --> 02:42:49.346]  I wasn't allowed a follow-up, but my follow-up was going to be, oh, so that's why we're there, to put down the violence, to get the Taliban out of there, and then clear a path for the oil and gas pipeline.
[02:42:49.346 --> 02:42:52.108]  Is that it, Ambassador Khalilzad?
[02:42:52.108 --> 02:42:57.131]  So, you know, it's a strategic sort of thing, where the U.S.
[02:42:57.131 --> 02:43:06.237]  will not act in any other way than as an empire, and you need to have a little bit of humility, because we're not going to be able to call the shots in that part of
[02:43:06.317 --> 02:43:08.379]  Well, here's my next question.
[02:43:08.379 --> 02:43:12.502]  I mean, as you know, you've studied it more than most out there.
[02:43:12.502 --> 02:43:16.245]  Nobody's ever been able to successfully continually conquer these people.
[02:43:16.245 --> 02:43:25.792]  I mean, can you just briefly sum up in maybe two minutes the mindset of these tribal groups, these Pashtuns and others, in Afghanistan and in areas of Pakistan?
[02:43:25.792 --> 02:43:35.140]  Because from my layman research and what every other analyst going back 400 years, people who fought there, have said is, the more you kill them, the more they fight.
[02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:39.482]  Well, I'd rather be, you know, back in 1776, I sure would rather have been an insurgent rather than a, you know, cooperator with the Tories.
[02:43:59.095 --> 02:44:12.146]  In a word, there are these strange people in Afghanistan, they're in tribes mostly, and they have this strange resistance to invaders coming into their country.
[02:44:12.146 --> 02:44:20.933]  And they have the benefit of these huge mountains and very vulnerable valleys, and so going back 2,500 years, Alex, to Alexander the Great,
[02:44:24.136 --> 02:44:29.941]  Who is the first of about seven big countries trying to conquer Afghanistan.
[02:44:29.941 --> 02:44:36.246]  They've been able to, the tribal leaders have been able to block that.
[02:44:36.246 --> 02:44:41.290]  And what I tell people is, you know why they call Alexander the Great?
[02:44:41.290 --> 02:44:49.917]  Well, they call him the Great because he was sensible enough to look at the height of those mountains, to look at the casualties he was already taking on his flanks from these, quote,
[02:44:51.892 --> 02:44:57.938]  And turn around and say, this wasn't a good idea, I'm going back to Asia Minor where I can outlast all this.
[02:44:57.938 --> 02:44:59.760]  That's what made him great.
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:12.693]  From him, since him, you have the Indians, you have the Persians, you have the Mongolians under Genghis Khan, you have the British, you have the Russians, and now the Americans are going to succeed where all those didn't?
[02:45:12.693 --> 02:45:13.494]  Give me a break.
[02:45:15.828 --> 02:45:16.771]  Oh boy, so what?
[02:45:16.771 --> 02:45:18.375]  We're going to be there in five years still.
[02:45:18.375 --> 02:45:19.418]  It's just never going to end.
[02:45:19.418 --> 02:45:24.270]  A meat grinder they feed troops into and out of it comes oil pipelines and opium.
[02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:32.864]  Well, I'm hopeful that the American people, you know, if they listen to people like us, finally, I think that I have some basic faith in the American people.
[02:45:32.864 --> 02:45:36.586]  They're good sense, and I think there's a limit to what they will tolerate.
[02:45:36.586 --> 02:45:46.672]  The big challenge, of course, Alex, and the reason I come on your show and applaud what you're doing is that you're one of the few people that tell it like it is.
[02:45:46.672 --> 02:45:50.714]  You're not under the fawning corporate media, and that's what we need.
[02:45:50.714 --> 02:45:52.695]  We need people to listen and then act.
[02:45:53.155 --> 02:45:55.876]  And I think action is necessary right now.
[02:45:55.876 --> 02:46:01.177]  Well, again, for those who just joined us, I'm not heaping laurels on you, sir, but people need to know you've been right.
[02:46:01.177 --> 02:46:14.259]  A full year and a half before it came out with Cy Hirsch and New Yorker Magazine, it was confirmed that Cheney wanted to paint up patrol boats blue and have Navy SEALs attack our own ships, and that was confirmed.
[02:46:14.259 --> 02:46:16.460]  Bush, of all people, said, no, we're not doing that.
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:17.360]  I don't know.
[02:46:38.587 --> 02:46:40.429]  I have it here in my stack.
[02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:44.612]  Washington Post, CNN, Business Insider.
[02:46:44.612 --> 02:46:46.194]  Cheney had gotten his way.
[02:46:46.194 --> 02:46:48.296]  We would have gone to war with Russia.
[02:46:48.296 --> 02:46:56.623]  And it's basically admitted in Ron Asmus' new book, who was inside these meetings, that NATO was part of it.
[02:46:56.623 --> 02:46:57.544]  They launched the attack.
[02:46:58.204 --> 02:47:05.410]  Uh, you know, uh, back, uh, you know, through Georgia, against South Ossetia on 888, and that Cheney wanted to go ahead and have nuclear war.
[02:47:05.410 --> 02:47:11.234]  I mean, that, that really shows these are completely unstable people, uh, like, like, you know, Curtis LeMay or somebody.
[02:47:11.234 --> 02:47:15.237]  And, and so, that mindset, has that carried over into Obama?
[02:47:15.237 --> 02:47:25.505]  Because when I see him out there, at least at some levels, supporting Israel and Netanyahu, saying they may hit Iran, can, can, can you speak to, you know, the mindset in the Pentagon?
[02:47:25.505 --> 02:47:27.187]  Is any of this Cheney stuff left there?
[02:47:27.927 --> 02:47:41.512]  Versus what's going on in the White House now, and then how that posture, the posture you believe from your research is there, how that's going to affect what goes on in Iran and now North Korea.
[02:47:43.223 --> 02:47:47.165]  Well, Iran, I think, is the most pressing issue.
[02:47:47.165 --> 02:47:59.813]  It's the one that the President has most difficulty with because the pressure from what is called the Likud Lobby, other people call it the Israel Lobby, is immense.
[02:47:59.813 --> 02:48:04.276]  And that's been demonstrated recently by a whole string of events.
[02:48:04.276 --> 02:48:12.401]  Dennis Blair, a former four-star admiral who headed up the national intelligence setup in our country, was canned last week.
[02:48:13.081 --> 02:48:13.942]  Why?
[02:48:13.942 --> 02:48:33.775]  Well, there were a bunch of misadventures with not catching potential terrorists, but the basic reason, in my view, that he was canned was that he had the temerity, 15 months ago, to appoint a person to be the chief analyst in our government, the chief intelligence analyst, a person named Chas Freeman,
[02:48:34.395 --> 02:48:44.679]  Who made the very bad mistake of saying publicly that he thought Palestinians also had rights as human beings in addition to Israelis.
[02:48:44.679 --> 02:48:48.221]  Now, what happened was, he was appointed by Dennis Blair.
[02:48:48.221 --> 02:48:49.722]  This is not a cabinet appointment.
[02:48:49.722 --> 02:48:54.984]  This is within his own little purview, head of the National Intelligence Council, Chas Freeman.
[02:48:55.684 --> 02:49:00.009]  He was appointed in the morning and he had lunch with David Broder of the Post.
[02:49:00.009 --> 02:49:03.574]  And David said, aren't you expecting a lot of opposition?
[02:49:03.574 --> 02:49:05.976]  And Freeman said, nah, it's going to sail through.
[02:49:05.976 --> 02:49:12.324]  Then Blair got up saying about the appointment and saying he was a terrific person.
[02:49:12.324 --> 02:49:13.986]  By 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:49:15.194 --> 02:49:23.761]  Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Lieberman from Connecticut, had gotten to Rahm Emanuel in the White House and said, we can't have this guy.
[02:49:23.761 --> 02:49:26.503]  He's too unbiased.
[02:49:26.503 --> 02:49:31.927]  He doesn't react with knee-jerk solidity to the interests of Israel.
[02:49:32.467 --> 02:49:43.893]  And so, Blair had to go back to Freeman and say, you know, I'm going to have to ask you to ask me to withhold your nominee, to reverse your appointment.
[02:49:43.893 --> 02:49:45.654]  It wasn't like a nomination.
[02:49:45.654 --> 02:49:47.275]  He had been appointed.
[02:49:47.275 --> 02:49:51.377]  So he served as National Intelligence Director for eight hours, okay?
[02:49:51.377 --> 02:49:53.518]  Now, that is unprecedented.
[02:49:53.518 --> 02:50:02.082]  I've seen a lot of stuff in my 50 years in Washington, but never before have I seen the Israel lobby or any other lobby derail an appointment that had already been made
[02:50:02.302 --> 02:50:05.705]  In the bowels of the intelligence community.
[02:50:05.705 --> 02:50:10.588]  Now, to the extent... So you're saying Israel's got pull that our government doesn't even have?
[02:50:10.588 --> 02:50:12.290]  Well, that seems to be the case.
[02:50:12.290 --> 02:50:15.412]  I had hoped it would be different with Obama, but it's not.
[02:50:15.412 --> 02:50:18.915]  Now, the other thing that's really important is this.
[02:50:18.915 --> 02:50:20.636]  We broached an agreement to Iran.
[02:50:21.528 --> 02:50:31.484]  Which would have resulted in about 70% of their low-enriched uranium being shipped out of the country for reprocessing for their medical reactor.
[02:50:31.484 --> 02:50:31.764]  Okay?
[02:50:31.764 --> 02:50:33.267]  That was October of last year.
[02:50:34.268 --> 02:50:46.255]  That didn't work out, partly because of insurgents in Iran funded by the US, Israel, and Pakistan.

[02:51:57.321 --> 02:52:02.284]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:02.284 --> 02:52:03.284]  What have we got?
[02:52:03.284 --> 02:52:05.726]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:05.726 --> 02:52:06.746]  A republic.
[02:52:06.746 --> 02:52:09.388]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:09.388 --> 02:52:11.649]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:11.649 --> 02:52:13.670]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:15.351]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:15.351 --> 02:52:16.672]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:16.672 --> 02:52:17.272]  Children?
[02:52:17.272 --> 02:52:18.392]  Our education?
[02:52:18.392 --> 02:52:19.233]  Our money?
[02:52:19.233 --> 02:52:22.875]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:23.231 --> 02:52:26.934]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:26.934 --> 02:52:28.215]  You are being warned.
[02:52:28.215 --> 02:52:29.236]  We have the facts.
[02:52:29.236 --> 02:52:30.397]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:30.397 --> 02:52:31.297]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:31.297 --> 02:52:32.198]  We have common law.
[02:52:32.198 --> 02:52:34.440]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:34.721 --> 02:52:38.582]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:38.582 --> 02:52:43.564]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:43.564 --> 02:52:45.044]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:45.044 --> 02:52:46.145]  Don't Tread on Me.

[02:52:59.449 --> 02:53:00.669]  This is not a drill.
[02:53:00.669 --> 02:53:02.590]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:53:03.251 --> 02:53:05.072]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:53:05.072 --> 02:53:12.295]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:53:12.295 --> 02:53:16.677]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.

[02:53:36.044 --> 02:53:36.745]  But listen up.
[02:53:36.745 --> 02:53:42.986]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.

[02:54:01.318 --> 02:54:06.503]  We're scheduled later in the next hour to have the runner-up in Miss USA pageant.
[02:54:06.503 --> 02:54:12.930]  She lost because she was against Arizona having a state copy of the federal law.
[02:54:12.930 --> 02:54:15.612]  It's exactly a copy of the federal law.
[02:54:15.612 --> 02:54:17.074]  So she's going to be popping in with us.
[02:54:17.614 --> 02:54:19.596]  Ray McGovern is with us for this segment and the next.
[02:54:19.596 --> 02:54:21.097]  We really appreciate his time.
[02:54:21.097 --> 02:54:21.818]  Here's some other news.
[02:54:21.818 --> 02:54:23.959]  We had Congressman Ron Paul on yesterday.
[02:54:23.959 --> 02:54:29.404]  Ron Paul said inside sources told him Fed is panicking at mass awakening.
[02:54:29.404 --> 02:54:37.291]  And if Ron Paul says that you can bank it, that's up on GCNlive.com, the article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:37.291 --> 02:54:40.353]  That's GCNlive.com.
[02:54:40.353 --> 02:54:41.374]  Okay, Ray, we've only got about four
[02:54:41.374 --> 02:54:42.955]  Four minutes here, five minutes in the next segment.
[02:54:42.955 --> 02:54:45.017]  Again, very thankful for your time.
[02:54:45.017 --> 02:54:47.599]  You were finishing up with the situation with Iran.
[02:54:47.599 --> 02:54:50.741]  Netanyahu says they may strike.
[02:54:50.741 --> 02:54:55.445]  Talking to folks in intelligence, out of intelligence, with your ear to the ground.
[02:54:55.445 --> 02:54:57.446]  Is it on the front burner again?
[02:54:57.446 --> 02:54:59.068]  And what's the time frame?
[02:54:59.068 --> 02:55:01.810]  And then see what will happen if we do attack.
[02:55:03.362 --> 02:55:14.518]  Well, to address your last point first, Alex, it would be a catastrophe if we and or the Israelis attacked Iran.
[02:55:14.518 --> 02:55:18.163]  Among other things, they have the option of closing the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:55:18.784 --> 02:55:19.085]  I think so.
[02:55:34.674 --> 02:55:38.177]  The situation right now is highly interesting.
[02:55:38.177 --> 02:55:42.921]  The bottom line is that the Israel lobby has shown its power once again.
[02:55:42.921 --> 02:55:49.687]  And, now get this, this is the important conclusion, at least from my analysis.
[02:55:49.687 --> 02:55:57.995]  Neither Israel nor the United States is terribly worried about a nuclear weapon in Iran.
[02:55:57.995 --> 02:55:58.596]  If they were,
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:13.413]  They would have welcomed this new tripartite deal between Brazil, Turkey, and Iran, which provides for half, fully half, of the low-enriched uranium to go out of country into Turkey.
[02:56:13.413 --> 02:56:18.318]  Now, that's the uranium that would have to be refined to a higher degree to make a bomb.
[02:56:18.758 --> 02:56:27.225]  So, if half of Iran's uranium is going out of the country for a whole year, wouldn't you think that the Israelis in the U.S.
[02:56:27.225 --> 02:56:28.246]  would be happy about that?
[02:56:28.246 --> 02:56:30.268]  Yeah, Iran is buckling.
[02:56:30.268 --> 02:56:35.613]  I mean, every time, going back, as you know, five years, they try to be friendly, they get slapped down.
[02:56:36.033 --> 02:56:36.773]  Yeah.
[02:56:36.773 --> 02:56:44.476]  Well, what happened, as soon as this deal was announced, Hillary Clinton got up and said, no, no, no, we're not going to go that route.
[02:56:44.476 --> 02:56:45.216]  That's naive.
[02:56:45.216 --> 02:56:51.218]  What we're going to do is sanctions in the UN, and we're persuaded the Russians and the Chinese, and we're going to just get these guys.
[02:56:51.218 --> 02:56:55.499]  Well, you know, that's really interesting, because you know what?
[02:56:55.499 --> 02:56:58.480]  The President of the United States encouraged
[02:56:59.255 --> 02:56:59.435]  I think.
[02:57:16.323 --> 02:57:25.889]  So we're about to break, but to interrupt, correct me if I'm wrong, basically it's showing there's a fight going on inside the Obama administration, and they were trying to do something reasonable, but somebody else has come in and said, uh-uh.
[02:57:48.410 --> 02:57:49.851]  That is incredible!
[02:57:49.851 --> 02:57:50.712]  It really is!
[02:57:50.712 --> 02:57:52.753]  And you won't find it in the New York Times, will you?
[02:57:52.753 --> 02:57:56.476]  But that's the text of the President's letter to Brazil.
[02:57:56.476 --> 02:58:14.830]  And Hillary Clinton and the other neocons, and those particularly susceptible to influence from the Likud lobby, have put the kibosh on what should be a very, very favorable, very encouraging development, namely for Iran to ship half of its uranium out of country.
[02:58:14.830 --> 02:58:16.731]  So we're coming back with only five more minutes.
[02:58:17.732 --> 02:58:19.053]  Just fast when we come back.
[02:58:19.053 --> 02:58:20.634]  What's the game plan then?
[02:58:20.634 --> 02:58:22.375]  The game plan is regime change.
[02:58:22.375 --> 02:58:23.936]  That's what they care about.
[02:58:23.936 --> 02:58:32.421]  And anything that will make Ahmadinejad look more reasonable or make Iran look better, they're against because they don't care about the uranium.
[02:58:32.421 --> 02:58:35.103]  They care about regime change.
[02:58:35.103 --> 02:58:37.304]  We'll talk about North Korea coming up.
[02:58:37.304 --> 02:58:42.908]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:42.908 --> 02:58:46.110]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:46.943 --> 02:58:53.607]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:58:53.607 --> 02:58:58.750]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:58:58.750 --> 02:59:07.475]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:07.475 --> 02:59:11.538]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:59:11.538 --> 02:59:13.779]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:59:15.831 --> 02:59:20.554]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:59:20.554 --> 02:59:24.397]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:59:24.397 --> 02:59:25.618]  Others don't.
[02:59:25.618 --> 02:59:27.779]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:59:27.779 --> 02:59:29.561]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:59:29.561 --> 02:59:32.443]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:59:32.443 --> 02:59:39.067]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:59:39.067 --> 02:59:41.769]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:59:41.769 --> 02:59:44.151]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[02:59:44.151 --> 02:59:45.012]  Others don't.
[02:59:49.781 --> 02:59:52.189]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:52.189 --> 02:59:54.357]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio.
[03:00:06.750 --> 03:00:13.532]  We got the runner-up from Miss USA on who lost because she is for states' rights.
[03:00:13.532 --> 03:00:15.793]  She's going to be joining us in the next segment.
[03:00:15.793 --> 03:00:17.193]  Ray McGovern, you've got the floor.
[03:00:17.193 --> 03:00:21.015]  Former CIA top analyst to the president.
[03:00:21.015 --> 03:00:28.317]  You wanted to finish up with the neocons admitting it's not about nukes in Iran and then briefly the situation on the Korean Peninsula.
[03:00:29.670 --> 03:00:46.153]  Sure, I think the most recent very clear indication of what bothers the neocons and the Israel lobby is in Tom Friedman's, he's a very much pro-Israel fellow, his op-ed in the New York Times yesterday
[03:00:46.773 --> 03:00:48.214]  He's got a couple of lies in it.
[03:00:48.214 --> 03:00:53.276]  He says experts say that they still have enough uranium to do a nuclear weapon.
[03:00:53.276 --> 03:00:53.896]  That's wrong.
[03:00:53.896 --> 03:00:56.457]  The intelligence community does not say that.
[03:00:56.457 --> 03:01:02.640]  They also suggest that the Iranian facilities are not under U.N.
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:03.280]  inspection.
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:04.481]  That's wrong.
[03:01:04.481 --> 03:01:07.422]  What makes it clear is he's not interested in the uranium.
[03:01:07.422 --> 03:01:11.304]  He's interested in regime change, and he finishes up with that appeal.
[03:01:12.004 --> 03:01:17.066]  So, what we need to realize here is that this whole thing is easily explainable.
[03:01:17.066 --> 03:01:17.927]  Why the U.S.
[03:01:17.927 --> 03:01:27.851]  and why the Israelis would not welcome the shipping out of half of Iran's uranium for reprocessing elsewhere is because they don't care about that.
[03:01:27.851 --> 03:01:39.956]  They care about regime change, and what they're trying to do is get that to happen largely through a lot of covert action, support of disparate groups within Iran, now openly acknowledged by the New York Times.
[03:01:41.420 --> 03:01:41.500]  Yes.
[03:01:58.962 --> 03:02:05.924]  Five senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards generals, and that's what put the kibosh on the last deal.
[03:02:05.924 --> 03:02:11.246]  Now, it's interesting to see that The New York Times is advertising the same kind of activity now.
[03:02:11.246 --> 03:02:20.569]  We'll see how hard Israel and the United States tries to put the kibosh on this deal, which really should go through and would obviate the necessity.
[03:02:20.669 --> 03:02:28.293]  So they're moving us towards war, doing everything they can to sabotage a peace process, and this will go down in history either way.
[03:02:28.293 --> 03:02:30.294]  Oh wait, two minutes left, sir.
[03:02:30.294 --> 03:02:31.715]  North Korea.
[03:02:31.715 --> 03:02:36.177]  Well, you know, Alex, it's really interesting, because we don't have the whole story on what happened.
[03:02:36.177 --> 03:02:45.802]  It looks pretty sure that a North Korean torpedo did hit this South Korean ship, but the details have not been released.
[03:02:45.802 --> 03:02:48.383]  They may give it to the Russians and the Chinese, but not to us.
[03:02:49.164 --> 03:02:55.531]  The problem is that there's an armistice, there's not a peace agreement, and there are disputed territories.
[03:02:55.531 --> 03:03:07.564]  There are North Korean and South Korean fishermen fighting over crabs every year, and this is the season, and there are South Korean ships and North Korean ships both killed or sunk 1999.
[03:03:09.326 --> 03:03:09.767]  I think?
[03:03:25.487 --> 03:03:34.935]  Should Hillary Clinton use the same language used by Dean Acheson back in 1950, that this is, quote, unprovoked aggression, end quote?
[03:03:34.935 --> 03:03:40.280]  It may be a provocation, it may be retaliation, we just don't know yet.
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:50.129]  Well, we know Kim Jong-il looks like a scarecrow, looks like death warmed over, so anytime we could see a collapse of the regime, and who knows how that'll go, so it's another powder keg.
[03:03:50.816 --> 03:03:51.858]  That's exactly right.
[03:03:51.858 --> 03:04:07.240]  No one really knows what's going on within that country, and so it's really hard to guess as to what the motivation might have been, other than the normal sort of jousting, the normal trying to head off ships from the other country.
[03:04:08.649 --> 03:04:14.054]  Well, that's good news to hear that you're not as concerned about North Korea as the media has been hyping it to be.
[03:04:14.054 --> 03:04:15.156]  So we'll continue to watch that.
[03:04:15.156 --> 03:04:21.021]  I appreciate you coming on to cover what's happening all over the planet and the geopolitical breakdown.
[03:04:21.021 --> 03:04:27.228]  And I look forward to talking to Ray McGovern, a retired former senior CIA analyst, to the president.
[03:04:27.228 --> 03:04:27.968]  God bless you, sir.
[03:04:27.968 --> 03:04:28.249]  Thank you.
[03:04:30.069 --> 03:04:37.053]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm very excited about our next guest, and we are going to open the phones up for her.
[03:04:37.053 --> 03:04:38.974]  A lot of supporters out there.
[03:04:38.974 --> 03:04:47.619]  A Miss Oklahoma, a runner-up in Miss USA, and the media reported she would have won if she'd have been against states' rights.
[03:04:47.619 --> 03:04:49.821]  She'll be joining us coming up.
[03:04:49.821 --> 03:04:50.641]  We'll be right back.

[03:05:54.787 --> 03:05:57.789]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:57.789 --> 03:06:03.131]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:03.131 --> 03:06:05.172]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:05.172 --> 03:06:10.174]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:10.174 --> 03:06:11.355]  How much do you want?
[03:06:11.355 --> 03:06:12.095]  When do you want it?
[03:06:12.475 --> 03:06:14.355]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:14.355 --> 03:06:15.416]  When will you need it?
[03:06:15.416 --> 03:06:17.636]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:17.636 --> 03:06:18.957]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:18.957 --> 03:06:20.497]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:20.497 --> 03:06:25.758]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:25.758 --> 03:06:29.339]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:29.339 --> 03:06:32.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:33.160 --> 03:06:34.382]  How much will you need?
[03:06:34.382 --> 03:06:35.303]  We don't know.
[03:06:35.303 --> 03:06:36.404]  How much do you want?
[03:06:36.404 --> 03:06:37.325]  All you can get.
[03:06:37.325 --> 03:06:38.426]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:38.426 --> 03:06:41.470]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:41.470 --> 03:06:43.252]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:43.252 --> 03:06:44.173]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:53.834 --> 03:06:55.134]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:55.134 --> 03:07:00.736]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:07:00.736 --> 03:07:05.738]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:07:05.738 --> 03:07:10.780]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:16.544]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:07:16.544 --> 03:07:18.865]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:07:18.865 --> 03:07:23.668]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:07:23.668 --> 03:07:24.769]  And here's the best part.
[03:07:24.769 --> 03:07:27.831]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:07:27.831 --> 03:07:31.474]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:07:31.474 --> 03:07:34.656]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:34.656 --> 03:07:36.877]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:36.877 --> 03:07:37.798]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:07:41.440 --> 03:07:45.686]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:07:45.686 --> 03:07:50.513]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:07:50.513 --> 03:07:53.256]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:53.256 --> 03:07:54.879]  Oscar Nunez, your question please.
[03:07:56.445 --> 03:07:57.566]  How are you?
[03:07:57.566 --> 03:07:58.987]  I'm doing so great.
[03:07:58.987 --> 03:07:59.787]  Thank you.
[03:07:59.787 --> 03:08:00.608]  All righty.
[03:08:00.608 --> 03:08:09.994]  Arizona's new immigration statute authorizes law enforcement authorities to check the citizenship of anyone they believe may be in the country illegally.
[03:08:09.994 --> 03:08:13.256]  Now listen to the question before you move.
[03:08:13.256 --> 03:08:18.340]  Critics say this may amount to racial profiling.
[03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:22.783]  Do you think that this should be mandated by the state or by the federal government?
[03:08:24.986 --> 03:08:27.208]  I'm a huge believer in states' rights.
[03:08:27.208 --> 03:08:37.457]  I think that's what's so wonderful about America.
[03:08:37.457 --> 03:08:42.061]  So I think it's perfectly fine for Arizona to create that law.
[03:08:42.061 --> 03:08:46.505]  And I am against illegal immigration, but I'm also against racial profiling.
[03:08:46.505 --> 03:08:49.428]  So I see both sides in this issue.
[03:08:49.428 --> 03:08:50.409]  Thank you all for coming.
[03:08:52.489 --> 03:08:59.497]  Now, I don't normally watch beauty pageants, because I don't watch a lot of television, but when I am watching the news, I see highlights of it.
[03:08:59.497 --> 03:09:11.970]  I'm obviously red-blooded, so my eyes are trained like a wolf looking at a, you know, a... But the issue here is that I happened to be up here while this was live, turned on the television, and saw all the ladies come out.
[03:09:12.851 --> 03:09:20.397]  And I remember looking at Morgan Elizabeth Woollard, Miss Oklahoma, and thinking, well, she certainly stands out.
[03:09:20.397 --> 03:09:21.578]  Because it's more than just looks.
[03:09:21.578 --> 03:09:22.599]  She's obviously beautiful.
[03:09:22.599 --> 03:09:23.820]  I could tell she was intelligent.
[03:09:23.820 --> 03:09:26.222]  She had that spark about her.
[03:09:26.222 --> 03:09:37.131]  And it's great to see her so informed about the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Ninth and Tenth Amendment versus Miss Teen South Carolina, who literally didn't even know what planet she was on.
[03:09:37.131 --> 03:09:38.452]  We'll play that clip coming up later.
[03:09:39.173 --> 03:09:49.863]  But I didn't know I was watching controversy when I happened to watch 30 minutes of it that evening because I didn't continue to watch to see the final judging.
[03:09:49.863 --> 03:09:55.569]  And then I discovered and the news reported she may have lost because she didn't answer that politically correct.
[03:09:55.569 --> 03:09:56.269]  You heard the.
[03:09:57.827 --> 03:10:02.869]  The judge asked about the Arizona law and he said, well wait, don't boo yet.
[03:10:02.869 --> 03:10:16.056]  And then she got this big standing ovation that I would say was five, six, seven times louder than the boos, and we'll play it again coming up just to have it on record, that the people responded to states' rights.
[03:10:16.056 --> 03:10:17.737]  I mean, the government's too big, it's out of control.
[03:10:18.317 --> 03:10:25.804]  Mexico's collapsing, but you know she went on to say, like Ron Paul, Congressman, said here yesterday, he is against racial profiling if it's misused.
[03:10:25.804 --> 03:10:27.205]  But that wasn't good enough.
[03:10:27.205 --> 03:10:37.574]  But to really pick her brain, because there's nothing like beauty and brains all together, is Morgan Elizabeth Woollard, the runner-up, second place in Miss USA.
[03:10:37.574 --> 03:10:38.635]  Great to have you here with us.
[03:10:38.635 --> 03:10:40.277]  Thanks for coming on.
[03:10:40.277 --> 03:10:41.418]  Thank you very much.
[03:10:41.418 --> 03:10:42.399]  Thank you for having me.
[03:10:43.123 --> 03:10:45.464]  Again, Miss Oklahoma on the line with us.
[03:10:45.464 --> 03:10:49.966]  Well, I mean, let's go back to the pageant a week and a half ago.
[03:10:49.966 --> 03:10:51.227]  What happened there?
[03:10:51.227 --> 03:10:53.428]  Anything that happened behind the scenes?
[03:10:53.428 --> 03:10:54.228]  Break it down for us.
[03:10:55.742 --> 03:10:56.682]  The behind the scenes?
[03:10:56.682 --> 03:10:57.823]  Well, what do you mean?
[03:10:57.823 --> 03:11:00.884]  We're there two and a half weeks before the actual telecast.
[03:11:00.884 --> 03:11:04.525]  And so, there are a lot of behind the scenes to discuss.
[03:11:04.525 --> 03:11:05.726]  Exactly, that's what I meant.
[03:11:05.726 --> 03:11:08.387]  I mean, because all we see is the limited cuts.
[03:11:08.387 --> 03:11:12.248]  I mean, did somebody say something to you after you answered that way?
[03:11:12.248 --> 03:11:18.271]  Or did you ever get word like, ooh, that was a screw-up, you should have called for world government, or you should have called for us turning our guns in?
[03:11:20.117 --> 03:11:45.462]  Well, I mean, they don't speak to you at all afterward about, you know, how you answered your question, but I think afterward, of course, the media definitely brought that to my attention and were wondering, simply from the scoring, you know, I was actually ahead the entire competition until then, and of course, having judges in the entertainment industry, which is predominantly liberal, they do question whether it hurt my chances or not.
[03:11:46.687 --> 03:11:55.710]  Yeah, that's a key statistics that Fox News did cover and Miss Oklahoma named first runner-up in Miss USA pageant after answering immigration questions.
[03:11:55.710 --> 03:11:58.171]  You were way ahead until that point.
[03:11:58.171 --> 03:11:59.652]  I mean, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[03:11:59.652 --> 03:12:12.537]  And I don't, I mean, I talked to you earlier, you don't want to be somebody who's a sword loser, but if you were ahead and then suddenly you got behind, I mean, that is suspicious.
[03:12:12.537 --> 03:12:13.797]  Yeah, I mean, I guess so.
[03:12:15.828 --> 03:12:26.492]  With me, I just kind of have to have a positive perspective and, you know, when you work so hard for something, the last thing you want to think of is the way you answered your question, is what did you win.
[03:12:26.492 --> 03:12:39.917]  And so, I just choose not to flagellate my mind with anything condemning like that and, you know, not be a sore loser or victimize myself, but rise above it and be happy for Rima and just move on to the next chapter of my life.
[03:12:40.626 --> 03:12:45.731]  Well, she is obviously intelligent and lovely as well, but I think you are the clear winner.
[03:12:45.731 --> 03:12:52.499]  And again, the entire time, thank you, you were ahead until you didn't answer the thing politically correct.
[03:12:52.499 --> 03:12:55.882]  And, you know, the issue is, tell us about the rules, because I'm not an expert on this.
[03:12:55.882 --> 03:12:58.305]  In fact, I'm ignorant on this subject.
[03:12:59.506 --> 03:13:00.466]  Is it political?
[03:13:00.466 --> 03:13:04.347]  Do the judges tell you, if I don't agree with your politics, I'm going to vote against you?
[03:13:04.347 --> 03:13:07.688]  Because, you know, we need to know if it is rigged.
[03:13:07.688 --> 03:13:13.129]  I mean, I understand you don't want to go there, but this is quite an issue.
[03:13:13.129 --> 03:13:21.431]  Well, I don't think the USC system is quite as transparent with their judging criteria and how the whole process goes.
[03:13:23.095 --> 03:13:31.823]  But I believe once you get to the top 5, or I think even through 15, 10 to 5, they erase the scores entirely and it starts all over again.
[03:13:31.823 --> 03:13:40.472]  And so, once you do make top 5 and answer a question, you have a final look, and I believe they rank you after that.
[03:13:40.472 --> 03:13:43.995]  And so, you know, it could be they liked her personality better.
[03:13:43.995 --> 03:13:44.435]  I don't know.
[03:13:46.144 --> 03:13:50.426]  You know, all I can say is I did my best, and I'm proud of my answer.
[03:13:50.426 --> 03:13:51.646]  I have no regrets.
[03:13:51.646 --> 03:13:54.687]  People ask me all the time if I would have voted differently.
[03:13:54.687 --> 03:14:00.969]  No, I do believe in states' rights, and I think I took a stance, but I did it diplomatically.
[03:14:00.969 --> 03:14:02.510]  Well, you certainly did.
[03:14:02.510 --> 03:14:03.770]  Very diplomatic.
[03:14:03.770 --> 03:14:05.971]  You could be an ambassador for the U.S.
[03:14:05.971 --> 03:14:06.491]  in the future.
[03:14:06.491 --> 03:14:07.712]  I mean, you answered it perfectly.
[03:14:07.712 --> 03:14:12.433]  Well, that was my hope of becoming a USA.
[03:14:12.433 --> 03:14:14.114]  To be an ambassador for my country.
[03:14:14.867 --> 03:14:22.686]  Dad just was not on the cards for me, and I was blessed to even compete for such a prestigious title, so first runner-up is quite the honor.
[03:14:23.578 --> 03:14:26.418]  Well, you know, I'm really proud of you and so are my listeners.
[03:14:26.418 --> 03:14:28.879]  We got a lot of fan mail for you here at the office.
[03:14:28.879 --> 03:14:48.322]  People just calling in and emails, just when we played the clip, saying, wow, this is wonderful, especially in Oklahoma, your home state, where you are, Miss Oklahoma, because people appreciated you not going with the politically correct answer, because that's what really is valuable, is telling the truth, standing up for what you believe in.
[03:14:48.322 --> 03:14:52.143]  And so, you know, that made you the winner overall when it came to defending this republic.
[03:14:52.708 --> 03:14:53.489]  Thank you very much.
[03:15:03.339 --> 03:15:06.381]  Right, and that's what makes it even more difficult, I think.
[03:15:06.381 --> 03:15:16.249]  You know, this is such a hot-button issue that is on our TVs, you know, 20 hours of the day, and I have 20 seconds to sum it up.
[03:15:16.249 --> 03:15:18.991]  That is not the easiest thing in the world.
[03:15:18.991 --> 03:15:27.737]  And I think I'd also like to clarify, which I don't think a lot of people realize, is they didn't ask me whether I was for or against the law.
[03:15:27.737 --> 03:15:32.161]  They asked me whether I felt it should be, you know, state or federal.
[03:15:32.885 --> 03:15:36.606]  And I firmly believe in states' rights.
[03:15:36.606 --> 03:15:41.067]  I think a state should be allowed to mandate rules and regulations as they see fit.
[03:15:41.067 --> 03:15:48.749]  I love that we can put power in the hands of the people, and I fully support that.
[03:15:48.749 --> 03:15:58.911]  Well, on top of it, Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security, last week in congressional testimony, being questioned by John McCain, said, I haven't read the Arizona bill.
[03:15:58.911 --> 03:16:00.552]  Yes, that's correct.
[03:16:00.552 --> 03:16:01.552]  Oh, you saw that?
[03:16:01.552 --> 03:16:02.112]  I did, yes.
[03:16:04.008 --> 03:16:06.369]  I mean, how can then she condemn it if she hasn't read it?
[03:16:06.369 --> 03:16:07.189]  Because I have read it.
[03:16:07.189 --> 03:16:08.309]  I've read it here on air.
[03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:10.750]  It is identical to the federal law.
[03:16:10.750 --> 03:16:11.210]  Eric Holder.
[03:16:11.210 --> 03:16:16.351]  He hasn't read it as well, I believe.
[03:16:16.351 --> 03:16:18.892]  Who did you say hasn't read it?
[03:16:18.892 --> 03:16:20.212]  Attorney General Eric Holder.
[03:16:20.212 --> 03:16:20.993]  Yes, yes, you're right.
[03:16:20.993 --> 03:16:22.093]  He admits it.
[03:16:22.093 --> 03:16:26.414]  So, what's your take on them commenting on something they haven't read?
[03:16:26.414 --> 03:16:30.675]  Well, I certainly think that's an issue.
[03:16:30.675 --> 03:16:33.776]  I think, you know, before you believe in something,
[03:16:35.558 --> 03:16:41.332]  If you're firmly against something, you should know what all that bill entails and what is within it.
[03:16:41.332 --> 03:16:43.477]  So, I think that is certainly an issue.
[03:16:47.168 --> 03:16:47.548]  Wow.
[03:16:47.548 --> 03:16:50.269]  Well, listen, while you're here on air, we've got you until about 45 after.
[03:16:50.269 --> 03:16:52.390]  We're appreciative of the time.
[03:16:52.390 --> 03:16:54.571]  Anything else you want to set the record straight on?
[03:16:54.571 --> 03:16:56.092]  We're talking to Miss Oklahoma.
[03:16:56.092 --> 03:16:59.173]  She got second place runner-up in Miss USA.
[03:16:59.173 --> 03:17:07.116]  She was ahead the entire time until she didn't sell America out on national television.
[03:17:07.116 --> 03:17:09.137]  But again, she's being a good sport.
[03:17:11.258 --> 03:17:18.480]  Well, you know, if I think there was one thing that I could set the record straight with, it would just be that I'm one who does not want to victimize myself.
[03:17:18.480 --> 03:17:20.160]  I think a lot of promos in the media are saying
[03:17:33.499 --> 03:17:47.224]  Miss Oklahoma lost her crown because of what she said, and you know, truthfully, yes, it was a gullible question and it was doomed for a polarizing answer, but I really don't want to victimize myself.
[03:17:47.224 --> 03:17:50.066]  Miss USA wasn't a do-or-die situation for me.
[03:17:50.066 --> 03:17:56.188]  It would have been an incredible honor to represent the USA system and Donald Trump and my country.
[03:17:56.897 --> 03:18:13.722]  But, you know, that didn't work out for me, and being scholastically and professionally active, I know that I have great things coming in life regardless, and so I just want people to know I'm not bitter, I am not a victim, and that I'm going to do good things with my life regardless of the crown.
[03:18:14.673 --> 03:18:20.174]  Well, I honor that, and I know my listeners do, so you're being a great sport about it.
[03:18:20.174 --> 03:18:21.435]  But I want to be clear.
[03:18:21.435 --> 03:18:42.060]  I think people who do think that that question was wrong and do think that you were penalized, I think in future, the fans of Miss USA should put their input in about the transparency of the judging rules so that the young ladies know what they're going into.
[03:18:42.060 --> 03:18:43.420]  Right.
[03:18:45.208 --> 03:18:46.489]  Now, you're very young.
[03:18:46.489 --> 03:18:49.010]  I mean, you're in a, what, a sophomore or junior in college?
[03:18:49.010 --> 03:18:49.971]  A junior in college.
[03:18:49.971 --> 03:18:51.392]  I'm 21 years old.
[03:18:51.392 --> 03:18:53.453]  And so you can continue to be part of pageants.
[03:18:53.453 --> 03:18:55.294]  This isn't your last rodeo.
[03:18:55.294 --> 03:18:58.596]  Well, yes and no.
[03:18:58.596 --> 03:19:06.781]  The USA System, it goes on to Miss Universe, and because of that, it's the most prestigious pageant in the world.
[03:19:06.781 --> 03:19:13.405]  And so, I've kind of already competed as far up as I can go, and so if I wanted to compete, there are other
[03:19:15.321 --> 03:19:21.346]  There's Miss World, there's Miss International, and there's of course Miss America, who has the talent portion.
[03:19:21.346 --> 03:19:32.637]  And so, you know, I'm open-minded to that, but I think at this point in my life I'm ready to move on and pursue my career and finish my education and that kind of thing.
[03:19:32.637 --> 03:19:37.381]  I don't completely shut it out, but at this moment in time I don't think I'll be competing
[03:19:38.066 --> 03:19:38.706]  Well, that's great.
[03:19:38.706 --> 03:19:39.947]  I mean, you're very well balanced.
[03:19:39.947 --> 03:19:46.950]  You've got a larger universe out there than just these beauty pageants, but it is great to have Miss Oklahoma with us.
[03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:53.534]  We'll talk about her worldview and what she's planning in her career next when we get back.
[03:19:53.534 --> 03:19:54.034]  Stay with us.
[03:19:55.356 --> 03:20:00.319]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:20:00.319 --> 03:20:01.320]  What have we got?
[03:20:01.320 --> 03:20:03.761]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:20:03.761 --> 03:20:04.782]  A republic.
[03:20:04.782 --> 03:20:07.424]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:20:07.424 --> 03:20:09.685]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:20:09.685 --> 03:20:11.706]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:20:11.706 --> 03:20:17.270]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[03:20:17.270 --> 03:20:20.912]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:24.953]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:20:24.953 --> 03:20:26.254]  You have been warned.
[03:20:26.254 --> 03:20:27.275]  We have the facts.
[03:20:27.275 --> 03:20:28.436]  We have the Constitution.
[03:20:28.436 --> 03:20:29.337]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:20:29.337 --> 03:20:30.218]  We have common law.
[03:20:30.218 --> 03:20:32.480]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:32.759 --> 03:20:36.621]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:20:36.621 --> 03:20:41.583]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:20:41.583 --> 03:20:43.104]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:20:43.104 --> 03:20:44.164]  Don't Tread on Me.
[03:20:44.164 --> 03:20:50.587]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:20:55.535 --> 03:20:56.916]  Are you prepared?
[03:20:56.916 --> 03:20:59.216]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[03:20:59.216 --> 03:21:00.597]  There is a difference.
[03:21:00.597 --> 03:21:06.479]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.
[03:21:06.479 --> 03:21:09.480]  All Tactown gear has been field tested by Canadian and U.S.
[03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:11.281]  forces, so you know it's tough.
[03:21:11.281 --> 03:21:12.281]  What kind of gear?
[03:21:12.281 --> 03:21:14.422]  72-hour survival kits as low as $55.
[03:21:14.422 --> 03:21:15.022]  Holsters for $21.
[03:21:17.483 --> 03:21:17.863]  We're good to go.
[03:21:37.205 --> 03:21:40.830]  Visit tacktowngear.com right now for your preparedness needs.

[03:21:43.873 --> 03:21:45.696]  Tactowngear dot com.

[03:21:55.208 --> 03:21:59.330]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[03:21:59.330 --> 03:22:03.592]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[03:22:03.592 --> 03:22:05.172]  You get less for your money.
[03:22:05.172 --> 03:22:11.015]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[03:22:11.275 --> 03:22:11.495]  I think so.
[03:22:34.312 --> 03:22:34.552]  We're good.
[03:22:55.862 --> 03:22:58.864]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:22:58.864 --> 03:23:04.208]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:04.208 --> 03:23:06.250]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:06.250 --> 03:23:10.333]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only
[03:23:12.410 --> 03:23:12.691]  We're good.
[03:23:31.169 --> 03:23:32.090]  We're good to go!
[03:23:57.017 --> 03:24:00.858]  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S.
[03:24:00.858 --> 03:24:02.418]  on a world map.
[03:24:02.418 --> 03:24:05.759]  Why do you think this is?
[03:24:05.759 --> 03:24:08.559]  I personally believe that U.S.
[03:24:08.559 --> 03:24:20.502]  Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps and I believe that our education, like such as
[03:24:21.022 --> 03:24:23.444]  Thank you Miss South Carolina.
[03:24:23.444 --> 03:24:28.707]  It is refreshing to have Miss Oklahoma on with us and runner-up for Miss USA.
[03:24:53.075 --> 03:24:57.217]  Well, you know, I'm not one to judge anyone, so all I can say is
[03:25:18.857 --> 03:25:30.607]  God bless her and it's, you know, it's not easy being up there in front of millions of people and lights in your face, you know, and possibly becoming a potential YouTube moment.
[03:25:30.607 --> 03:25:37.953]  There's a lot going through your brain, so you gotta give her some credit for at least putting herself out there and, you know, doing her best, right?
[03:25:38.803 --> 03:25:40.124]  Hey, at least she got in the arena.
[03:25:40.124 --> 03:25:45.306]  I'm just saying, comparing her to you, it is night and day.
[03:25:45.306 --> 03:25:51.489]  Now, during the break, I brought up Carrie Prejean, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[03:25:51.489 --> 03:26:03.414]  I vaguely remember last year, the big controversy, where she said, my parents brought me up to be pro-family, and marriage is an institution that deals with that, and you said, well,
[03:26:03.954 --> 03:26:26.088]  I get asked about a lot of that, and you told me privately your views on it, but it's such a hot issue, so putting it as nicely as you can, I mean, you were explaining the parallel of even if you basically were dissed for answering the question the way you were, you don't want to be seen as basically running with it or milking it?
[03:26:26.088 --> 03:26:27.429]  Right.
[03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:32.832]  Well, you know, I think a lot of people have been comparing me to Kerry Prejean or saying,
[03:26:33.442 --> 03:26:36.924]  I'm the next Carrie Prejean, because it is kind of ironic.
[03:26:36.924 --> 03:26:41.146]  You know, she gets the gay marriage question, I get the illegal immigration question.
[03:26:41.146 --> 03:26:47.028]  We both gave fairly conservative answers, are pretty blondes, then end up fresh underwrap, right?
[03:26:47.028 --> 03:26:53.991]  Um, so, there are definitely some comparisons there, but I just didn't want to victimize myself.
[03:26:53.991 --> 03:27:01.515]  I felt she kind of melts her time in the media just for being controversial, and, um,
[03:27:02.190 --> 03:27:09.537]  I just didn't want people to see me as the same or victimize me or anything along those lines, if that makes sense.
[03:27:09.537 --> 03:27:19.727]  But, I mean, every year now it's about politics, people losing who are the runner-ups because they have conservative or constitutional or traditional values.
[03:27:19.727 --> 03:27:24.031]  I think Donald Trump needs to get the politics out of this because the message to people is
[03:27:24.591 --> 03:27:31.193]  You know, if you don't have the right political view, it's not how talented or how beautiful or how dynamic you are.
[03:27:31.193 --> 03:27:33.093]  You know, this is political correctness.
[03:27:33.093 --> 03:27:36.374]  And I think, frankly, I think it was political correctness.
[03:27:36.374 --> 03:27:42.275]  I mean, I think the Lebanese woman is bombshell beautiful, but I don't think she was in the top five.
[03:27:42.275 --> 03:27:45.896]  I mean, I happened to, again, just catch about 20 minutes of it.
[03:27:45.896 --> 03:27:49.957]  It was pure torture, of course, while I was drinking coffee after my Sunday show.
[03:27:49.957 --> 03:27:52.158]  But I mean, I'm sorry.
[03:27:52.158 --> 03:27:53.358]  I don't think she's second place.
[03:27:53.818 --> 03:27:58.859]  I saw you out there on that runway, and let me tell you, it was like my eyes were on springs.
[03:27:58.859 --> 03:28:01.160]  I hope my wife's not listening.
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:02.740]  I'm sorry, but no, I mean, seriously.
[03:28:02.740 --> 03:28:05.201]  I mean, I thought you were the most beautiful.
[03:28:05.201 --> 03:28:06.401]  You popped out there.
[03:28:06.401 --> 03:28:08.681]  That's the reason you were in the leadership role.
[03:28:08.681 --> 03:28:17.883]  And if you'd have said, I'm against Arizona, I love open borders, I love world government, I love crime, it would have been bong, bong, bong, you know, jackpot, you're the winner.
[03:28:17.883 --> 03:28:19.324]  I'm sorry, they stole it from you.
[03:28:21.311 --> 03:28:26.915]  You know, again, I would hope that's not the case, but you're actually correct, actually.
[03:28:26.915 --> 03:28:36.803]  Rima, while she is stunningly beautiful, if you average some evening gown, I think she was actually in seventh place.
[03:28:36.803 --> 03:28:47.491]  And so, you know, winning, I'm so proud of her, and I think it's awesome that she's Arab-American, and I think that's, you know, a great, neat thing for our country, but
[03:28:48.406 --> 03:28:52.347]  It is a little disappointing for me, you know, when you want something so badly and...
[03:28:53.613 --> 03:28:56.455]  So close, but so far.
[03:28:56.455 --> 03:29:02.519]  But again, I'm doing okay, I'm not bitter, and I'm just excited for what's next in my life.
[03:29:24.473 --> 03:29:25.854]  I mean, come on!
[03:29:25.854 --> 03:29:26.354]  Come on!
[03:29:26.354 --> 03:29:42.960]  You know, Rima, honestly, she's got the funniest, goofiest personality, and I really think she just won him over in her interview, because she's just such a relatable, um... Miss Oklahoma, stay there!
[03:29:42.960 --> 03:29:45.341]  One more segment with you!
[03:29:45.341 --> 03:29:46.741]  We're on the march.
[03:29:46.741 --> 03:29:48.402]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:48.402 --> 03:29:51.983]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:54.735 --> 03:29:56.396]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:29:56.396 --> 03:29:59.759]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[03:29:59.759 --> 03:30:04.983]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[03:30:14.930 --> 03:30:16.050]  Take my word for it.
[03:30:16.050 --> 03:30:18.711]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[03:30:18.711 --> 03:30:25.214]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[03:30:30.416 --> 03:30:31.757]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[03:30:46.782 --> 03:30:47.302]  Thank you!
[03:30:54.411 --> 03:30:56.732]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:30:56.732 --> 03:30:59.113]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:30:59.113 --> 03:31:02.314]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:02.314 --> 03:31:07.435]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:07.435 --> 03:31:11.617]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:11.937 --> 03:31:14.399]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:14.399 --> 03:31:17.160]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:17.160 --> 03:31:20.082]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:20.082 --> 03:31:27.687]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:28.024 --> 03:31:33.286]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:33.286 --> 03:31:36.267]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:36.267 --> 03:31:39.949]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:39.949 --> 03:31:41.009]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:41.009 --> 03:31:42.350]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:42.350 --> 03:31:43.850]  Invisible Empire.

[03:31:55.086 --> 03:31:58.068]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[03:31:58.068 --> 03:32:00.149]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[03:32:00.149 --> 03:32:02.891]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[03:32:02.891 --> 03:32:05.133]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[03:32:05.133 --> 03:32:06.533]  Okay, here it comes.
[03:32:06.533 --> 03:32:08.435]  But first, the facts.
[03:32:08.435 --> 03:32:10.376]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[03:32:10.376 --> 03:32:12.357]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[03:32:12.357 --> 03:32:16.040]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[03:32:16.040 --> 03:32:23.784]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[03:32:23.784 --> 03:32:24.405]  Sinofresh.
[03:32:24.665 --> 03:32:27.727]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[03:32:45.979 --> 03:32:46.379]  It works!
[03:33:02.142 --> 03:33:02.262]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:33:02.262 --> 03:33:04.305]  Your chance to talk to Miss Oklahoma runner-up in Miss USA.
[03:33:12.185 --> 03:33:15.907]  Morgan Elizabeth Woollard is our guest for another segment.
[03:33:15.907 --> 03:33:23.350]  I've got some final news I want to hit on the financial front with world markets collapsing all over the place in the last segment today.
[03:33:23.350 --> 03:33:28.592]  Again, thank you for joining us, radio listeners.
[03:33:28.592 --> 03:33:32.094]  I want to go to calls, but I also want to talk about you and the future.
[03:33:32.094 --> 03:33:39.217]  I mean, you're intelligent, you're smart, you're a constitutionalist, you're for states' rights, you've been punished for standing up for your rights even if you won't
[03:33:39.477 --> 03:33:40.638]  Well, that's a loaded question.
[03:33:40.638 --> 03:33:41.658]  Oh my goodness, so much to say there.
[03:34:09.651 --> 03:34:16.396]  I have been incredibly blessed with being given numerous options from here.
[03:34:16.396 --> 03:34:29.647]  You know, the Miss USA pageant, just the exposure itself is a blessing, especially if you want to be in the media, and so I'm very thankful for all the opportunities that have come my way because of this pageant.
[03:34:29.647 --> 03:34:33.209]  I'm already getting offers, you know, within the broadcasting world, modeling world, acting
[03:34:34.491 --> 03:34:36.673]  Posting, anything of that nature.
[03:34:36.673 --> 03:34:43.419]  So I think right now I just need to decide what's best for me in my future and take a risk and go a direction.
[03:34:43.419 --> 03:34:46.922]  And I also need to finish my education as well.
[03:34:46.922 --> 03:34:48.804]  I'm getting close, but not quite there yet.
[03:34:48.804 --> 03:34:55.730]  So hopefully I can find a way to pursue finishing my education and starting my career at the same time.
[03:34:56.223 --> 03:34:58.484]  Well let me just inject this.
[03:34:58.484 --> 03:35:04.688]  There's a lot of anchors on television like Peter Jennings that don't have degrees.
[03:35:04.688 --> 03:35:06.429]  And I would strike while the iron's hot.
[03:35:06.429 --> 03:35:12.693]  You can always go back to college, but right now you're smart, you're talented, you're well-spoken, you're beautiful.
[03:35:12.693 --> 03:35:17.016]  I would get into the media and I would take every opportunity you've got right now.
[03:35:17.016 --> 03:35:20.018]  Because I'm not bashing college and education, that's fine and dandy.
[03:35:20.818 --> 03:35:32.588]  It's just that Bill Gates, Rush Limbaugh, if you look at the statistics, over 90% of the top CEOs, media people, you name it, didn't go to college or quit college because they were already go-getters.
[03:35:32.588 --> 03:35:36.311]  By 20 years old, halfway into college, they already had opportunities.
[03:35:36.311 --> 03:35:37.351]  Same thing with me.
[03:35:37.351 --> 03:35:43.857]  I was 21, I had about another year and a half of college left, I'd already gone and gotten a radio show locally, and I was sayonara.
[03:35:44.517 --> 03:35:47.498]  But again, I'm just saying strike while the iron's hot.
[03:35:47.498 --> 03:35:48.758]  Strike while you're in the spotlight.
[03:35:48.758 --> 03:35:57.041]  Because you could argue, due to that controversial question and your controversial answer for some, you almost got more attention than the lady that won Miss USA.
[03:35:57.041 --> 03:36:01.242]  So at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if they stole the crown from you, because you still win!
[03:36:01.242 --> 03:36:06.264]  Yes, you know, it really is a win-win situation.
[03:36:06.264 --> 03:36:10.705]  I'm incredibly blessed, and again, so grateful for all these opportunities.
[03:36:12.975 --> 03:36:15.016]  So you're getting a lot of offers right now.
[03:36:15.016 --> 03:36:16.377]  Acting, TV, you name it.
[03:36:16.377 --> 03:36:17.617]  Just dive in with both feet.
[03:36:17.617 --> 03:36:18.538]  You name it.
[03:36:18.538 --> 03:36:23.080]  You know, I think the hardest part is just figuring out which route to take.
[03:36:23.080 --> 03:36:25.161]  Because, of course, you want to do what's best for you.
[03:36:25.161 --> 03:36:27.642]  You want to do what's best for your future.
[03:36:27.642 --> 03:36:32.064]  And take the bull by the horn and make the right decision.
[03:36:32.064 --> 03:36:32.744]  And I think that's
[03:36:35.336 --> 03:36:36.616]  Well, let me give you some advice.
[03:36:36.616 --> 03:36:38.217]  Don't sign anything.
[03:36:38.217 --> 03:36:40.657]  Try a lot of different things.
[03:36:40.657 --> 03:36:45.439]  Because Hollywood TV, it's full of a lot of flim flamers, a lot of talkers.
[03:36:45.439 --> 03:36:53.161]  But just, you know, I would go with the big companies or established companies who can give you bonafide money at the bottom.
[03:36:53.161 --> 03:36:57.902]  Because they'll sit there and string you along to see where your career's going.
[03:36:57.902 --> 03:37:01.383]  So, I mean, again, I would just hit the ground running and try a lot of things out.
[03:37:01.383 --> 03:37:02.403]  And that's why I'm warning you.
[03:37:03.083 --> 03:37:04.764]  Because most people won't do this.
[03:37:04.764 --> 03:37:11.927]  College, especially when you're already being launched and propelled, you can always go back into the college.
[03:37:11.927 --> 03:37:14.608]  You can't always get this advantage you've got right now.
[03:37:14.608 --> 03:37:17.829]  You can't always get the present back.
[03:37:17.829 --> 03:37:18.269]  Right.
[03:37:18.269 --> 03:37:25.292]  And that's kind of another position I'm in, in regards to being in between a rock and a hard place.
[03:37:25.292 --> 03:37:30.574]  Because both of my parents are within the medical field, and they're all about
[03:37:31.286 --> 03:37:33.167]  Education, education, education.
[03:37:33.167 --> 03:37:41.769]  And so, um, for me, I just need to find a place or relocate to a place that I can pursue both at once.
[03:37:41.769 --> 03:37:43.130]  That's the way to do it.
[03:37:43.130 --> 03:37:46.371]  That you need to take advantage of things while they're hot.
[03:37:46.371 --> 03:37:49.312]  And, you know, when they're in front of you, you gotta grab them.
[03:37:49.312 --> 03:37:51.573]  Otherwise, life might, you know, pass you by.
[03:37:51.573 --> 03:37:56.514]  When things are hot in front of you, you gotta grab them.
[03:37:56.514 --> 03:37:58.375]  That's a good quote from Miss Oklahoma.
[03:38:02.569 --> 03:38:03.450]  Absolutely!
[03:38:03.450 --> 03:38:12.420]  So you could go to Chicago, New York, LA, places like that and... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:38:12.420 --> 03:38:14.121]  Oh, I was just agreeing.
[03:38:14.121 --> 03:38:15.463]  Well, listen... I live in a big city.
[03:38:16.132 --> 03:38:16.712]  Absolutely.
[03:38:16.712 --> 03:38:28.479]  Well, before we go to Eric, Chris, Mike, and others with Miss Oklahoma, the Patriot, who we just love to death, give us some of your other views on the Second Amendment.
[03:38:28.479 --> 03:38:34.383]  Have you heard all these world leaders calling for global government and that we need to have the private central banks running things?
[03:38:34.383 --> 03:38:37.205]  What's your view on Ron Paul?
[03:38:37.205 --> 03:38:43.469]  I think Ron Paul is a wonderful man and I agree with him on a lot of stances.
[03:38:43.469 --> 03:38:45.790]  I've always been a bit of a constitutionalist myself.
[03:38:46.637 --> 03:38:52.839]  And I believe in limited government and liberty and rule of law and all those wonderful things in America.
[03:38:52.839 --> 03:38:58.801]  Self-governance, that kind of thing.
[03:38:58.801 --> 03:39:00.842]  Well, that's wonderful.
[03:39:00.842 --> 03:39:07.004]  Again, while we've got you here, where would you like to see our republic going?
[03:39:07.004 --> 03:39:12.506]  Have you heard them talk on the news about forming this world government?
[03:39:12.506 --> 03:39:13.327]  World government?
[03:39:14.693 --> 03:39:17.294]  By that, do you mean giving the government more power?
[03:39:17.294 --> 03:39:26.039]  Well, you've got Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the UN, Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU, the outgoing Prime Minister of England, Gordon Brown, Al Gore.
[03:39:26.039 --> 03:39:32.442]  The heads of the G20 are calling for a global government to set worldwide taxes.
[03:39:32.442 --> 03:39:35.664]  And I was just asking if you were concerned about that.
[03:39:35.664 --> 03:39:37.325]  I'm definitely concerned about that.
[03:39:37.325 --> 03:39:40.186]  I've always been for limited government.
[03:39:42.185 --> 03:39:49.959]  Being able to be your own keeper and having self-government and, you know, making something of yourself and not relying too much on the government for that.
[03:39:49.959 --> 03:39:55.028]  And so, I'm definitely against big government in the world.
[03:39:57.728 --> 03:40:00.510]  Well, I tell ya, I wish you were Miss USA.
[03:40:00.510 --> 03:40:02.331]  Somebody to really represent our country.
[03:40:02.331 --> 03:40:03.992]  But you are representing our country.
[03:40:03.992 --> 03:40:05.073]  Thank you.
[03:40:05.073 --> 03:40:09.656]  And people just appreciate that you didn't sell out your values.
[03:40:09.656 --> 03:40:14.999]  I mean, you had to know, though, when he asked the question, that... I mean, did it run through your head?
[03:40:14.999 --> 03:40:18.101]  Well, if I give the politically correct answer, he's gonna like that?
[03:40:18.101 --> 03:40:20.863]  Or are you just such a patriot that there wasn't even a question?
[03:40:22.142 --> 03:40:27.527]  Well, truthfully, in that moment in time, you don't have time to think.
[03:40:27.527 --> 03:40:28.909]  You just go with what you know.
[03:40:28.909 --> 03:40:29.790]  Exactly.
[03:40:29.790 --> 03:40:31.651]  And, you know, I know who I am.
[03:40:31.651 --> 03:40:33.994]  I know what I believe and why I believe it.
[03:40:33.994 --> 03:40:37.337]  And with that said, it was easy for me to answer.
[03:40:37.337 --> 03:40:44.144]  I didn't have to think twice about it because that's who I am and that's how I was raised and, you know, I stood firm in that.
[03:40:46.192 --> 03:40:55.298]  Well, that's why people admire you, not just for your beauty or the electric presence, but the mind that powers it all.
[03:40:55.298 --> 03:40:56.318]  So exciting.
[03:40:56.318 --> 03:41:00.141]  Miss Oklahoma, Morgan Elizabeth Woollard is our guest.
[03:41:00.141 --> 03:41:02.322]  We're now going to go to a few phone calls.
[03:41:02.322 --> 03:41:05.484]  Let's talk to Eric in Oklahoma, your home state.
[03:41:05.484 --> 03:41:07.905]  You're on with Miss Oklahoma.
[03:41:07.905 --> 03:41:09.126]  Hi, Alex.
[03:41:09.126 --> 03:41:10.067]  It's really good to talk to you.
[03:41:10.067 --> 03:41:11.788]  It's been years since I've talked to you, actually.
[03:41:12.843 --> 03:41:16.786]  Uh, my cousin was Miss America, Chantal Smith, in 87.
[03:41:16.786 --> 03:41:19.908]  And she's just a beautiful girl, and Morgan, you're just another one.
[03:41:19.908 --> 03:41:22.490]  You just represent Oklahoma wonderfully.
[03:41:22.490 --> 03:41:26.612]  I'm very, very proud of you, and that's basically all I had to say.
[03:41:26.612 --> 03:41:29.855]  Just proud to see Oklahoma girls just doing so well.
[03:41:29.855 --> 03:41:30.995]  Thank you, sir, very much.
[03:41:30.995 --> 03:41:32.336]  I appreciate that.
[03:41:32.336 --> 03:41:38.320]  Miss USA has never had an Oklahoma Miss USA before, so I was hoping to make history there.
[03:41:38.320 --> 03:41:42.403]  I was only a few short points off, but I was so proud to represent our state.
[03:41:43.527 --> 03:41:44.548]  Oh, that's right.
[03:41:44.548 --> 03:41:50.731]  You lost the pageant, but you kept your integrity, and that's what matters at the end of the day, and you'll be rewarded.
[03:41:50.731 --> 03:41:54.853]  God will open bigger doors for you because you didn't sell out.
[03:41:54.853 --> 03:41:56.273]  That's what's always happened with me.
[03:41:56.273 --> 03:42:04.278]  I've been fired, you name it, before for not compromising, and it's just every time I do the right thing, it's just doors open up everywhere.
[03:42:04.278 --> 03:42:06.639]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:42:06.639 --> 03:42:08.340]  Specific questions for our guests.
[03:42:08.340 --> 03:42:10.721]  Chris in Indiana, you're on the air with Miss Oklahoma.
[03:42:12.386 --> 03:42:15.967]  Thank you Megan and Alex for taking my call.
[03:42:15.967 --> 03:42:19.128]  First, your answer was outstanding.
[03:42:19.128 --> 03:42:20.888]  Outstanding.
[03:42:20.888 --> 03:42:24.209]  A beauty pageant is beyond just beauty and body.
[03:42:24.209 --> 03:42:26.050]  It's mind and soul.
[03:42:26.050 --> 03:42:27.890]  And you scored 10s on all of them.
[03:42:27.890 --> 03:42:29.131]  So, thank you.
[03:42:29.131 --> 03:42:30.931]  Thank you for being a good patriot.
[03:42:30.931 --> 03:42:32.111]  Absolutely.
[03:42:32.111 --> 03:42:35.492]  Proud to be an American.
[03:42:35.492 --> 03:42:41.814]  21, in college, what is your opinion or what are you seeing as far as the increased police state?
[03:42:43.176 --> 03:42:50.121]  Yeah, what do you think of the Patriot Act being used against US citizens?
[03:42:50.121 --> 03:42:54.364]  They've got legislation introduced where citizens can be secretly arrested.
[03:42:54.364 --> 03:43:02.570]  We're seeing in universities, I don't know about Oklahoma, but more and more censorship of libertarian or conservative political viewpoints.
[03:43:02.570 --> 03:43:03.511]  Thanks for the call, Chris.
[03:43:03.511 --> 03:43:05.292]  Let's get her take on that question.
[03:43:06.192 --> 03:43:08.114]  I'm sorry, what exactly are you asking me?
[03:43:08.114 --> 03:43:11.337]  Well, I mean, what do you think about the loss of liberty?
[03:43:11.337 --> 03:43:12.979]  The erosion of the Bill of Rights?
[03:43:12.979 --> 03:43:15.081]  Warrantless wiretapping?
[03:43:15.081 --> 03:43:17.523]  Are you concerned about that?
[03:43:17.523 --> 03:43:21.187]  Well, I think that kind of goes along with what we were speaking about earlier.
[03:43:21.187 --> 03:43:23.609]  It's giving the government too much power.
[03:43:23.609 --> 03:43:26.693]  And, you know, I don't want our freedoms to be taken away.
[03:43:26.693 --> 03:43:29.155]  I don't want our liberty to be taken away.
[03:43:29.155 --> 03:43:30.056]  I think those things
[03:43:31.118 --> 03:43:34.400]  is exactly what makes America, America.
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:48.547]  And just being able to govern yourself and, you know, not having, like I said, the government controlling too many aspects of our lives, I definitely think there's a point where they need to step back and give us our freedom again.
[03:43:49.865 --> 03:43:52.228]  Absolutely, and we've got to step up and take them back.
[03:43:52.228 --> 03:43:53.609]  Absolutely.
[03:43:53.609 --> 03:44:05.540]  Did you hear of the debate with Lou Dobbs and others about the North American Union, SPP, NAFTA superhighways, all these toll roads going in that the money then goes to foreign corporations in Spain and Europe?
[03:44:05.540 --> 03:44:06.941]  I mean, A, have you heard of that?
[03:44:06.941 --> 03:44:09.864]  B, what's your take on it?
[03:44:09.864 --> 03:44:13.708]  I've not heard too much about that, to be honest, especially if it's recent.
[03:44:14.261 --> 03:44:20.243]  Being in Vegas for Miss USA for three weeks, we kind of live in a fishbowl.
[03:44:20.243 --> 03:44:24.484]  So I haven't been able to be watching the news as often as I normally do.
[03:44:24.484 --> 03:44:31.966]  But as far as foreign nations go, I do think we need to become less dependent on them.
[03:44:31.966 --> 03:44:33.847]  Let's take a call from Micah in New Orleans.
[03:44:33.847 --> 03:44:38.128]  You're on the air with a runner-up in Miss USA who said she's for states' rights.
[03:44:38.128 --> 03:44:38.468]  Go ahead.
[03:44:39.347 --> 03:44:40.467]  It's an honor.
[03:44:40.467 --> 03:44:40.747]  Ms.
[03:44:40.747 --> 03:44:51.471]  Willard, I want to first congratulate your parents on raising a woman that is an inspiration in every manner and every way possible.
[03:44:51.471 --> 03:44:52.831]  Thank you, sir.
[03:44:52.831 --> 03:45:03.014]  You should be, uh, the Oklahoma should be proud, America should be proud, and you will be number one in our hearts and our minds forever.
[03:45:03.749 --> 03:45:04.689]  Yeah, I want to say this.
[03:45:04.689 --> 03:45:11.511]  I've got two great little blonde haired daughters and I hope they grow up to be as, you know, passionate and informed about our country.
[03:45:11.511 --> 03:45:13.352]  I know they will be.
[03:45:13.352 --> 03:45:15.433]  As Miss Oklahoma, go ahead.
[03:45:15.433 --> 03:45:22.175]  I have no doubt, Alex, that your children are going to be firecrackers.
[03:45:22.175 --> 03:45:26.956]  Miss Willard, do you have any brothers and sisters?
[03:45:26.956 --> 03:45:27.596]  Yes, sir.
[03:45:27.596 --> 03:45:29.337]  I have two older sisters.
[03:45:30.311 --> 03:45:30.971]  Wonderful.
[03:45:30.971 --> 03:45:35.714]  I'm certain that that's even more the reason to congratulate your parents.
[03:45:35.714 --> 03:45:39.836]  And I would ask this, how do you feel about dating older men?
[03:45:39.836 --> 03:45:40.456]  Okay.
[03:45:40.456 --> 03:45:40.897]  All right.
[03:45:40.897 --> 03:45:42.137]  I appreciate the call.
[03:45:42.137 --> 03:45:44.319]  Let me throw this out there, though.
[03:45:44.319 --> 03:45:50.442]  Are you looking forward to, you know, after you've gotten into your career, getting hitched and having some kids?
[03:45:51.286 --> 03:45:52.547]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:45:52.547 --> 03:45:55.288]  I'm a big believer in family.
[03:45:55.288 --> 03:45:57.129]  And I'm looking forward to that day.
[03:45:57.129 --> 03:46:06.853]  I don't know when that day will be, but I definitely am someone who wants to have a wonderful family and children and, you know, a great American family.
[03:46:08.803 --> 03:46:12.667]  Well, it's been great having you here, and we appreciate your courage.
[03:46:12.667 --> 03:46:18.834]  Did we ever find that clip, guys, of Carrie Pijon, however you pronounce it?
[03:46:18.834 --> 03:46:20.916]  We didn't find that, because I heard it all over the news last year.
[03:46:20.916 --> 03:46:24.600]  You can probably use YouTube, Carrie Pijon's
[03:46:25.641 --> 03:46:26.102]  Correct.
[03:46:26.102 --> 03:46:26.862]  You're exactly right.
[03:46:52.675 --> 03:46:59.918]  I mean, are you critical of the lady who did milk it somewhat?
[03:46:59.918 --> 03:47:05.800]  Well, for me, I think... I wouldn't say critical.
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:07.641]  Definitely not of her answer.
[03:47:07.641 --> 03:47:09.161]  This is America.
[03:47:09.161 --> 03:47:12.683]  And in the First Amendment, we have freedom of speech.
[03:47:12.683 --> 03:47:18.785]  And so, she had every right to speak her beliefs.
[03:47:18.785 --> 03:47:20.966]  And so, I back her up fully with that.
[03:47:21.818 --> 03:47:30.740]  In mine, but I do feel that she kind of took it and ran with it and kind of overexposed herself to the media, I guess.
[03:47:30.740 --> 03:47:33.101]  And may have put a bad taste in people's mouth?
[03:47:33.101 --> 03:47:35.622]  Yeah, maybe so.
[03:47:35.622 --> 03:47:37.882]  So your problem isn't what she said.
[03:47:37.882 --> 03:47:38.663]  Oh, not at all.
[03:47:38.663 --> 03:47:41.783]  It's the fact that she did say, I was cheated, I was cheated.
[03:47:41.783 --> 03:47:42.424]  Exactly.
[03:47:42.424 --> 03:47:50.686]  I think, yeah, I think you should be humble in your loss and, you know, just realize that everything happens for a reason.
[03:47:51.647 --> 03:48:02.471]  As much as it stings sometimes, just to know that greater things are in store and just look forward to what God has next for your life.
[03:48:02.471 --> 03:48:03.152]  Absolutely.
[03:48:03.152 --> 03:48:04.492]  It's all in God's hands.
[03:48:04.492 --> 03:48:08.073]  Well, we appreciate you joining us.
[03:48:08.073 --> 03:48:09.054]  We've got about a minute left.
[03:48:09.054 --> 03:48:12.735]  Anything else that you forgot to add?
[03:48:12.735 --> 03:48:13.756]  I don't think so.
[03:48:13.756 --> 03:48:18.738]  Just, you know, how grateful I am for the overwhelming support I've received.
[03:48:18.738 --> 03:48:19.598]  Everyone has been
[03:48:20.231 --> 03:48:36.529]  Absolutely incredible, not just from the state of Oklahoma, but my entire country and even people all over the world just showered with love and support and people backing me up from all over the place and so I'm so grateful and I really am just honored and humbled.
[03:48:37.827 --> 03:48:40.308]  Well, that is my final question.
[03:48:40.308 --> 03:48:48.392]  Going back, you know, you hear on the video, the audio, and it sounded like five, six, seven times the cheering that there was the booing.
[03:48:48.392 --> 03:48:51.433]  You could barely hear the booing, but you were there.
[03:48:51.433 --> 03:48:57.936]  I mean, was the cheering for you a lot more overwhelming than the booing?
[03:48:57.936 --> 03:48:59.036]  Oh, without a doubt.
[03:48:59.036 --> 03:49:01.457]  I think it tripled the booing.
[03:49:01.457 --> 03:49:07.240]  As soon as I said I'm a firm believer in state strife and I love that about my country, everyone just
[03:49:08.380 --> 03:49:16.333]  Overflowed with, you know, clapping and cheering and I think the majority of the people there were in agreement with me on that statement.
[03:49:18.476 --> 03:49:40.761]  Well, all I can say is incredible, and it has been great having you on the broadcast, and I know that there's quite a few websites that have your info up, but I'm not going to try to give you advice for your career, but I would get a basic website up quickly that's yours, just so you get directed, you know, just so you get contacted directly by the media outlets and others that are out there.
[03:49:40.761 --> 03:49:45.622]  So we look forward to talking to Morgan Elizabeth Woolard again in the future.
[03:49:45.622 --> 03:49:47.923]  Thank you for being so nice and spending so much time with us today.
[03:49:48.405 --> 03:49:49.065]  Absolutely.
[03:49:49.065 --> 03:49:52.147]  Thank you for having me and thank you everyone for listening and tuning in.
[03:49:52.147 --> 03:49:53.227]  I appreciate it.
[03:49:53.227 --> 03:49:53.767]  God bless you.
[03:49:53.767 --> 03:49:54.628]  What a great patriot.
[03:49:54.628 --> 03:49:55.768]  What a darling.
[03:49:55.768 --> 03:49:58.509]  And the real winner of Miss USA.
[03:49:58.509 --> 03:49:59.270]  Obviously cheated.
[03:49:59.270 --> 03:50:07.633]  I had the entire time until the end when she didn't bow down to the La Reconquista and the New World Order and the Infisora.
[03:50:07.633 --> 03:50:12.656]  But look, I just spent 50 minutes with her because
[03:50:14.301 --> 03:50:21.406]  People wanted to have her on, and she stood up for what she believed in, and we've got a lot of other hardcore subjects that I covered in the first hour of the show.
[03:50:21.406 --> 03:50:25.810]  I'm going to cover some financial news when we come back to the last segment that's very important.
[03:50:25.810 --> 03:50:31.214]  But good job to Jaren and the rest of the crew for getting her on the show.
[03:50:31.214 --> 03:50:33.095]  Interesting interview.
[03:50:33.095 --> 03:50:36.598]  And I'll tell you, the crew liked this guest.
[03:50:36.598 --> 03:50:41.061]  It's better than CIA analyst and economist and things.
[03:50:41.061 --> 03:50:42.543]  Of course, I have to be quite frank with you.
[03:50:44.448 --> 03:50:48.950]  Those are my favorite type of guests, because I like to get people thinking, but you know what?
[03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:51.992]  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[03:50:51.992 --> 03:50:53.673]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:50:53.673 --> 03:50:55.874]  Stay with us.
[03:50:55.874 --> 03:50:57.755]  Don't answer it!
[03:50:57.755 --> 03:51:05.539]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[03:51:48.833 --> 03:51:50.494]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:51:50.494 --> 03:51:51.634]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:51:51.634 --> 03:51:53.235]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:52:02.701 --> 03:52:07.826]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:07.826 --> 03:52:12.329]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:12.329 --> 03:52:14.691]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:14.691 --> 03:52:17.234]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:17.234 --> 03:52:20.476]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:20.476 --> 03:52:28.083]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:28.403 --> 03:52:33.806]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:33.806 --> 03:52:36.668]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:36.668 --> 03:52:40.330]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:40.330 --> 03:52:41.431]  And I got news for you.
[03:52:41.431 --> 03:52:42.752]  You're everyone else.
[03:52:42.752 --> 03:52:44.253]  Invisible Empire.

[03:52:54.386 --> 03:52:55.307]  You worry.
[03:52:55.307 --> 03:52:57.328]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[03:52:57.328 --> 03:52:59.869]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[03:52:59.869 --> 03:53:01.970]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[03:53:01.970 --> 03:53:03.571]  Your answer may be at hand.
[03:53:03.571 --> 03:53:07.173]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[03:53:07.173 --> 03:53:12.416]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[03:53:12.416 --> 03:53:16.218]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[03:53:16.218 --> 03:53:17.519]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[03:53:17.884 --> 03:53:20.745]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[03:53:20.745 --> 03:53:24.067]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[03:53:24.067 --> 03:53:32.491]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[03:53:32.491 --> 03:53:37.194]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[03:53:52.020 --> 03:53:58.608]  Oh yeah!
[03:53:58.608 --> 03:54:04.175]  It is the final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:04.175 --> 03:54:07.178]  Is Europe heading for a meltdown?
[03:54:07.178 --> 03:54:09.741]  This is out of the London Telegraph.
[03:54:10.962 --> 03:54:12.784]  It's up on GCNlive.com.
[03:54:12.784 --> 03:54:21.311]  The financial crisis is worse than the subprime crash of 2008 because the sums are so much bigger and governments that are in dire straits.
[03:54:21.311 --> 03:54:24.514]  This is all part of the plan as we laid out over a decade ago.
[03:54:24.514 --> 03:54:26.756]  We have the IMF World Bank Takeover Plan.
[03:54:28.131 --> 03:54:28.752]  Here's another one.
[03:54:28.752 --> 03:54:29.112]  U.S.
[03:54:29.112 --> 03:54:35.158]  money supply plunges at 1930s pace as Obama eyes fresh stimulus.
[03:54:35.158 --> 03:54:39.122]  The money supply is being contracted, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:39.122 --> 03:54:41.925]  That is out of the London Telegraph as well.
[03:54:41.925 --> 03:54:43.046]  Here's the Financial Times.
[03:54:43.046 --> 03:54:45.869]  Debt crisis is dark cloud over Europe.
[03:54:47.415 --> 03:54:53.197]  Another key article, Ron Paul, inside source told me Fed is panicking at mass awakenings.
[03:54:53.197 --> 03:54:55.398]  GCNLive.com, Paul Watson article.
[03:54:55.398 --> 03:55:00.440]  Ron Paul on with us yesterday, you can watch both those videos at GCNLive.com, our interview with Ron Paul.
[03:55:00.440 --> 03:55:02.841]  So the good news is we're identifying the enemy.
[03:55:02.841 --> 03:55:06.582]  They know we're aware of what they're doing, but they're just imploding the entire economy.
[03:55:06.582 --> 03:55:12.605]  What did Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury, Wall Street Journal editor, father of Reaganomics, he said evil
[03:55:13.405 --> 03:55:14.866]  Has been turned loose.
[03:55:14.866 --> 03:55:16.507]  The government is completely evil.
[03:55:16.507 --> 03:55:20.689]  You got a few good people in the government, but the system is run by evil.
[03:55:20.689 --> 03:55:22.230]  And look, you wake up to that or it's over.
[03:55:22.230 --> 03:55:27.973]  Now, I'm not going to attack Glenn Beck and the whole media frenzy about what he sells gold for.
[03:55:27.973 --> 03:55:31.976]  Because some of that stuff's collectible, and it's good to have a mix.
[03:55:31.976 --> 03:55:37.198]  But non-collectible, semi-numismatic, the news reported $360 for a franc, and that was three months ago.
[03:55:40.424 --> 03:55:44.527]  When, when, you know, gold was down by like a hundred bucks.
[03:55:44.527 --> 03:55:49.070]  Ted has franks at a hundred and, I mean, 250 something.
[03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:51.992]  It's like a hundred bucks less than what, you know, big gold companies are selling it.
[03:55:51.992 --> 03:55:53.573]  Cause he bought it when it was lower.
[03:55:53.573 --> 03:55:56.515]  He's selling it to you when it's higher at the low price.
[03:55:56.515 --> 03:56:07.962]  So when I tell you that I get the daily sheets on this, when we do a gold offer, he's making three or four, maybe $5 different days on these Franks, on these Sovereigns, maybe $6 that are quarter ounce.
[03:56:08.983 --> 03:56:11.125]  And that's at the old amount.
[03:56:11.125 --> 03:56:14.067]  When he bought it when it was low, he's still selling it to you.
[03:56:14.067 --> 03:56:16.729]  You cannot get better deals from my research.
[03:56:16.729 --> 03:56:20.891]  Maybe they're there, you know, maybe a leprechaun's got a golden pot or something.
[03:56:20.891 --> 03:56:25.475]  But Ted, I wanted to bring you up briefly with a few news headlines on the economy, and then not just the Franks.
[03:56:26.243 --> 03:56:28.924]  That everybody else is selling for over $300.
[03:56:28.924 --> 03:56:33.545]  You got them for $250 something, but not for long, because they are selling out gold way up today.
[03:56:33.545 --> 03:56:38.646]  Tell folks about the coins, the offers, the toll-free number, because I believe in this.
[03:56:38.646 --> 03:56:42.787]  I buy my gold from you, because you've got the best deals.
[03:56:42.787 --> 03:56:44.488]  Now, normally, people pay a little more with you.
[03:56:44.488 --> 03:56:45.468]  It's still a great deal.
[03:56:45.468 --> 03:56:51.410]  These specials on this show, you got to tell them, when you call Alejandro Jones, that's me, sent you.
[03:56:51.410 --> 03:56:51.970]  Ted Anderson.
[03:56:52.330 --> 03:56:53.851]  Yeah, I'm with you right here, Alex.
[03:56:53.851 --> 03:56:57.593]  I can tell you right now, British sovereigns, I had to stop issuing them.
[03:56:57.593 --> 03:57:05.418]  I can't sell them right now because my European sources can't get them to me because the Europeans are buying them all up.
[03:57:05.418 --> 03:57:08.520]  There's not enough supply right now for me to be able to say I have those.
[03:57:09.022 --> 03:57:18.446]  But the francs are available, and I still have them at $256.68, and I still am buying a full year subscription to the International Forecaster if you only buy one.
[03:57:18.446 --> 03:57:21.488]  I need to say it right now, I mean, gold is up.
[03:57:21.488 --> 03:57:22.228]  Everything's strong.
[03:57:22.228 --> 03:57:23.829]  The Europeans are buying gold.
[03:57:23.829 --> 03:57:26.410]  They typically don't do it.
[03:57:26.410 --> 03:57:28.471]  They're not the kind of people that buy gold.
[03:57:28.471 --> 03:57:31.532]  People are screwballs!
[03:57:31.532 --> 03:57:32.173]  You cannot...
[03:57:33.451 --> 03:57:40.796]  250 something bucks for a fifth of an ounce gold coin that's got the numismatic, you know, some collector value, not a lot.
[03:57:40.796 --> 03:57:46.340]  The point is, that's bullion or below bullion because, and Ted, you are running out.
[03:57:46.340 --> 03:57:47.140]  You're out of the sovereigns.
[03:57:47.140 --> 03:57:47.761]  I didn't know that.
[03:57:47.761 --> 03:57:47.821]  800-686-2237.
[03:57:47.821 --> 03:57:48.261]  800-686-2237.
[03:57:48.261 --> 03:57:49.302]  Don't screw around, folks.
[03:57:49.302 --> 03:57:53.164]  I've been telling you seven years to buy gold back when it was $280 an ounce.
[03:57:53.164 --> 03:57:53.805]  Now it's 1,200 and something.
[03:58:02.250 --> 03:58:02.991]  Screw around.
[03:58:02.991 --> 03:58:04.712]  Is it a perfect investment?
[03:58:04.712 --> 03:58:05.553]  Nothing is.
[03:58:05.553 --> 03:58:07.055]  Nothing's 100% guaranteed.
[03:58:07.055 --> 03:58:08.716]  It's the best thing out there from my research.
[03:58:08.716 --> 03:58:09.477]  This is what I buy.
[03:58:09.477 --> 03:58:12.099]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:12.099 --> 03:58:16.043]  Ted, real fast, what are some of the other coins you've got screaming deals on?
[03:58:16.043 --> 03:58:18.865]  We've got eagles, we've got $10 Liberties, $20 Liberties.
[03:58:18.865 --> 03:58:20.567]  We've got a whole line of different things.
[03:58:20.567 --> 03:58:21.508]  Silver's at a good buy.
[03:58:21.508 --> 03:58:23.730]  We've got some of these rocking Liberty halves.
[03:58:23.730 --> 03:58:24.331]  Just call us at 800-686-2237.
[03:58:24.331 --> 03:58:24.691]  You'll find out.
[03:58:28.581 --> 03:58:30.603]  Thank you, 800-686-237.
[03:58:30.603 --> 03:58:31.784]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:31.784 --> 03:58:33.546]  Got Ray McGovern, everybody coming up.

[03:58:36.509 --> 03:58:39.913]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:45.302 --> 03:58:48.325]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:58:48.325 --> 03:58:53.651]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:58:53.651 --> 03:58:55.713]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:58:55.713 --> 03:59:00.699]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:59:00.699 --> 03:59:01.900]  How much do you want?
[03:59:01.900 --> 03:59:02.621]  When do you want it?
[03:59:03.001 --> 03:59:04.882]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:59:04.882 --> 03:59:05.962]  When will you need it?
[03:59:05.962 --> 03:59:08.163]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:59:08.163 --> 03:59:09.504]  Will there be any food?
[03:59:09.504 --> 03:59:11.024]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:59:11.024 --> 03:59:16.286]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:59:16.286 --> 03:59:19.868]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:59:19.868 --> 03:59:23.349]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:59:23.689 --> 03:59:24.910]  How much will you need?
[03:59:24.910 --> 03:59:25.831]  We don't know.
[03:59:25.831 --> 03:59:26.933]  How much do you want?
[03:59:26.933 --> 03:59:27.854]  All you can get.
[03:59:27.854 --> 03:59:28.955]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:59:28.955 --> 03:59:31.998]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:59:31.998 --> 03:59:34.101]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[03:59:41.449 --> 03:59:46.735]  Coast to Coast.
[03:59:46.735 --> 03:59:48.777]  Direct from Austin.
[03:59:48.777 --> 03:59:52.001]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
